- Hello. Hi. I did want to order. Great. Do you guys have a waffle iron down there? - You do. Okay. So what we'll do is-- Just one second. Okay. Yes? - Hal? - Yes. - I'm Rebecca Marin with Lichter and Haynes. - Oh, right. Of course. Come in. Okay. Uh, is this okay, in here? - That's fine. - Just--I just need a second. I'm finishing up a call. - Sure. - Help yourself to whatever. - You still there? Great. So a Belgian waffle or, you know, whatever kind of waffle. Do you have--do you have jam? Do you have passion fruit jam? Okay, great. Some of that. And then the spring pasta, no shrimp, just with the tomatoes and onions. Oh, and you have the tartar, right? Okay, great some of that. Uh, and then the ribeye, medium. - Test. Test. - Actually medium, not medium rare. - Test. Test. - Almost done. Hash browns, creamed spinach. Mm-hmm. And then just two martinis and a bottle of Montepulciano. Yeah. And a hot fudge sundae. Perfect. Thanks so much. Sorry about that. - It's fine. Sounds good. - Oh. Oh, my God. Look at all this. Should we do some small talk? - We can. Do you live here in Denver? - We'll skip that. Let's skip the small talk. - Whatever you say. With your permission, I'll start recording. - That's fine. I'm just gonna put on some music. - This is Hal Porterfield's updated background review. I am Rebecca Marin with Lichter, Haynes, and Associates. Okay, just some general. What is your birthday? - April 7, 1987. - Social Security is... - 958-00-0493. - And you're how tall? - I'm 6'3". - Weight? - Um, 200. - Pounds? - Yes, pounds. Is there something wrong? - No, that's fine. I'll just put that here. Have you ever been diagnosed with heart disease, diabetes, cancer of any kind? - Nope. - Crohn's disease, epilepsy, restless leg, high blood pressure, pneumonia? - No, ma'am. - In the last five years, have you been treated for alcohol or substance use disorder? This includes community support groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous. Are they even gonna read this? - Who? - The board. - I imagine they will, yes. - Hmm. And if I say something they don't like, then I don't get the position? - I can't speak to that. - But in your experience? - My experience is what you see here. I gather information, I verify it, and I produce a report. - So if I lied-- - I'd find out. - How? - Okay, it depends. In the case of your height and weight, I can use my eyes. You are not 6'3", and you do not weigh 200 pounds carrying groceries. - That's funny. - As I understand it, the board is considering you for a very high-profile-- a crucial role in the company, CEO. So no. They're not just gonna take your word for it, if that's what you're asking. - That's fine. So, um, I guess...yes. - Yes, you have been treated for alcohol use disorder? - Two times. - And I see you currently drink. - Socially. - Do you abuse prescription drugs? - Do I abuse prescription-- - Is that confusing? - Well, I take prescription drugs. I don't know how they feel about it. - Do you use recreational drugs? Marijuana, cocaine, MDMA, psychedelics, heroin. - Yeah. I mean, no. Not--not heroin. Come on. - How many times? - Um, how many times have I used recreational drugs? - Yes. - Ever? - Yes. - I mean, it's thousands. Tens of thousands. I don't know. I have no idea. - Okay, would you like me to write that? You said I shouldn't lie. - Do you suffer from any chronic sexually transmitted infections? HIV/AIDS, herpes simplex B, HPV. - If you want to know that for yourself, I'm happy to tell you about it. - It's part of the questionnaire. - No, it's not. - It is. Maybe you'd like me to write all of them. Maybe you'd like me to write, "Hal Porterfield fucks like Caligula." Hal Porterfield fucks like Caligula. You lost your virginity at what age? - Come on. - What? - What is this? - It's the next question. - 13. - No. - I did. - No. - To a camp counselor, actually. - Hal. I swear to God, this is all gonna go a lot faster if you just tell the truth. You've never been anywhere close to a rehab, and you can barely sip that whiskey without grimacing. So please stop posturing. You are embarrassing yourself. I'm gonna write that you lost your virginity at 25, and we're gonna move on, okay? - Fine. What? - That's true, isn't it? You lost your virginity at 25? - What's the next question? - It's actually true. - What is next on your form, Miss Attorney? - That's fascinating. - What are you doing? - I... You're not ugly. There's gotta be plenty of girls out there who brush their teeth until all their gums come off and prepare all their meals at the beginning of the week who'd have no problem going down on a sweet little nothing like you with your clean ass. - Mm. Yeah. No. This--okay. This is--this isn't-- this isn't what I wanted. This--it's not in the script. - The script. - Yeah. You're supposed to ask me... - Right. - How many times a day I masturbate. - "I want you to tell me in a really mean voice "that you're going to write that I lost my virginity at 25, "and then we're going to move on. "And then the next question is, 'Hal, how many times a day do you masturbate?'" - Right. And then this stuff about my cock. - Right, I see that. Yeah. - Right. So that's what I want you to say. So--so what's the problem exactly? - You want me to stick to your script? - I do. Yeah, you were doing great. You just don't have to add all the other stuff. I wrote it out so you'd know exactly what to say. - Got it. The man knows what he wants. - Exactly. - And I'm all about customer service. - Love hearing that. - I just... - What? - Can I say one thing before we dive back in? - Sure. - I can tell that you put a lot of thought into this, and I don't want to diminish all the great work that you've done. - Oh, thanks. No, that's fine. If you just read the script-- - Excuse me. I'm speaking. - Okay. - The service that I offer is very specific. And as I said in my email-- - I read the email. I'm not breaking any of the rules. We're not gonna touch. - It's not about the rules exactly. It's-- - I get it. There's no touching. That makes it hotter. Actually, I'm on board-- - Hal. Hal! I need some quiet. It's not about the rules, and it's not about what arouses you. That's, like, incidental. The reason that I don't touch my clients and that they don't touch me... Is that what they need from me is not physical. It's mental. - Yeah. And all this, it's mental. I'm saying it's better-- - And I am saying that this might be what you think that you want, but respectfully, you have no idea. I am saying that if I held a gun to your head, you couldn't tell me what it is that you really want. - All right. All right. I guess we should just figure out how much I owe you, 'cause this isn't-- - Don't do that. Don't sigh and roll your eyes like you're fucking retarded. What am I feeling right now about you, huh? - I don't know. - Well... how about you think for a second before you speak? Have you ever tried that? - You're disappointed in me? I am. - Mm-hmm. Mm. - You're not as stupid as you look. - Do you want to make me less disappointed? - What can I do? - Don't ask questions. This is a nice place. - Thanks. - Show me the bathroom. Is this it? - Mm-hmm. This needs to be cleaned. - Are you gonna clean it? - Okay. - You're gonna clean the bathroom by fucking up the beautiful hand towels? Try thinking. Attaboy. Is it dirty? - Um... - Is the counter dirty, Hal? It's all pretty clean, I think. - Stop. Look at me. It's not all clean. There's dirt. You're just too lazy and sloppy to find it. Do you need help? - Yes. - Then ask for it. - Will you help me clean the bathroom? - Sure. You can start by getting on the floor. Hal, you're gonna ruin your clothes. - I should take them off? - What the fuck do you think? Look at you. Barely cast a shadow. Crawl to the toilet. I want you to clean behind the toilet. That's where the dirt is. Hal. - Yes? - When you think of yourself, what do you see? Is it something like garbage? - No. - I think it's like a small white bag of rotten food and snotted tissue and broken glass. - No. - Maybe like a mound in the corner of a landfill? The slime that comes out of the bottom? The shit that just sits there that the Earth won't even take, not for one million years? This is very clean. - Thank you. - You might've earned a treat. Are you excited? You are? Okay. You can show me. Do you want to come? Are you thinking about what I want to hear? - Yes. - Well, stop. Do you want to come or not? - Yes. - Then ask me. - Can I come? - No. - Please? - No! You can jerk off, but if you come, I'll ruin your fucking life. Is that clear? - Oh, yes. - Go ahead. - How's it going over there? - Good. - Stop for a second. - Don't look at me. Sorry. - If you come without my permission, Hal, that is it. I swear to God. You can do a little more. You know what you actually are? It's like... imagine something that exists, like a bright red apple. Now imagine that it's gone. That is you. You aren't anything. You don't even take up space. - Oh, fuck. Okay. - Okay. - I need to. - You need to? - Yeah, is it okay? - You need to? - Is it okay? - Do you need to come? No. It's not okay. Stop. Take your hand away. Take your hand away. - Hal. Hal, look at me. You can't touch yourself, but you can come now. You have my permission. - I know what you need because you're mine. I know everything about you. - Ribeye, two martinis, a bottle of Montepulciano, and a hot fudge sundae. - Perfect. Thanks, Julian. I can take it from here. - Great. Oh, and it's Paul. - Oh, is it? Sorry about that. You're incredible. You know that? - It takes two. What? - Mm, nothing. I like watching you eat. - It's 'cause you're a pervert. I really liked that scene. - Yeah? What'd you like about it? - How committed you were. How much it meant to you. It's exciting to me when it gets like that. - Yeah, for me too. - The part about my work, how it's mental, not physical. - Well, you said that to me at our first session. Remember? - Of course. - Yeah. - I thought it was interesting, you bringing in the real-life stuff. - Real life? - Your dad's passing and your new role at the company. How are you doing? I mean, this must be so-- - Yeah, uh, no. It's been, uh, a lot to process. And I've been dealing with the inheritance and people coming out of the woodwork. I just keep wanting to turn to him because I'm expecting some joke or... I just miss him. Yeah. He was a fearless-- he was an asshole. You know, but I've never met anyone like him. Mm. - It sounds really, really tough. - Mm. How do you know about all this? - Well, when your dad passed, there was an article I read, and it said that you were his presumptive successor. So-- - No, I am-- I am his successor. That's the plan. - Presumptive successor, right? - Oh, right. Right. Yeah, no, this has been, um... expected of me, really. It's my--I mean, my whole life, and basically, just been waiting for this moment for years. - It's such a big deal, right? - I was actually gonna say the opposite because this has been part of the plan for so long. I mean, I guess there's a few kind of small things to get sorted out. - The board? - The board? - Well, I noticed in the scene, um, you had the board as this looming threat hanging over you. - Right. That's interesting that you would think that. But the thing is, we don't have a board. - Oh. - I think I got something stuck in my... - I just thought every public company had a board of directors. - We don't. That's not how we're structured. - Oh. - But anyway, listen. Um, I got something for you. - What is it? Open it. - Do you like it? - Fucking God. I mean... - It's a, um, Audemars Piguet. You know what that is? It's, like, one of the nicest watches in the world. - I--I just don't-- I don't-- I don't know what to say. - Don't. Just try it on. Just look at it. Yeah, it's the right color. Um, maybe you already know this, but what you do, your work, it's incredibly valuable, and it's made a big difference in my life. I don't know how to thank you, so yeah. - This is a start. - I'm glad. It's gonna be so weird to not have this as part of my routine anymore. I'm a little worried, actually. - What do you mean? - Well, just, you know, what I said, it's-- how it's been so helpful for me. - Yeah, well-- but why wouldn't it be a part of your routine? - Isn't this why you brought up the stuff about the company? I thought you understood. - Understood? No. - I've been thinking that this is probably not a good idea-- well, in fact, I know it's not-- for us-- for me to keep doing this... with you. - Mm. May I ask why? - I mean, you said it yourself. You know, this job and everything, it's a really big deal. And I--if I'm gonna do this, I'm... I need to match up my insides with my outsides and be a person that I want people to see, a person who wins. A person who wins? What we do in here, it's so meaningful. - Mm. - But it's just not something that goes with the next stage of my life. Does that make sense? - Sure. - I thought the watch would kind of communicate this better than-- - Oh. Oh. No. I get it. Um, it was like a retirement gift. Like I'm--like I'm a cop or something. - A cop? - I should go. - I'll walk you down. - Walk me down? - Yeah. - No. No. Goodbye here, please. - I'm--I'm really gonna miss this. I--I hope you believe me. Hey. Wait. Do you--you-- you don't want this? - Pleasure doing business. - Um, I don't have a strong opinion, so I'm saying whatever you think is best is-- - Hi. - Hi. - There's one more thing. - Okay. - Can I come back in? - Hey, can I call you back? Someone's here. Because I'm not a flowers guy. No, I do care, but can we just talk about this in a little bit? You too. What are you doing? - Who was that? - Uh, nobody. It's-- - Didn't sound like nobody. She wants you to pick out flowers. What did--what did you need? - "The first thing "and the hardest thing in business is to know who you are." "So before I give a presentation, "before I walk into a meeting, "before I sit down for a cup of coffee, I always do the same thing." "I match up my insides with my outsides." - You read my dad's book. Congratulations. - "I remember that while there are lucky strokes "and setbacks in life, "over any considerable period of time, "the truth becomes clear. "There are those who win and those who don't, "and I remember that I have answered that question for myself." "I am a person...who wins." - Thank you for that. - You couldn't even fire me without stealing from him. - I mean, come on. Obviously, I've learned things from him. - That's not what I'm talking about. I want to know something. Which is it? - Which is what? - Do you tend to win or do the other thing? - Do you want me to acknowledge that I have been lucky, that I have had it better than most people? I will. So-- - Answer the question. - I don't feel like doing that. - Well, what did your father think? - Judging by the fact that he left me the company, I mean-- - We know that's what he wanted. I'm asking what he thought of you. - Listen, this is completely inappropriate, and it's weird what you're doing. - Okay, so we've established what he thought. You tend to lose. - And what about you? - Me? - Yeah, you-- you know, deep down, without any doubt that you're a winner? You can say that about yourself? - The first time that I went to the dentist, I was 19 years old. - Okay. - He took one look inside of my mouth, and do you know what he said? - No. - He said, "Perfect." He said, "A plus." I did that--me-- because nobody else gave a flying fuck. That is who I am. - Okay, it doesn't matter what my father thought. I am in this position, and I can say with confidence that I can do this job. I know what it takes. I am--I am prepared. That is all that matters. - Mm. I believe you when you say that. - Because? - Why? - I do believe it. - Yeah. Why? - Why what? - Your dad didn't believe you could. Where did you get the idea, the gall, to think that you could step into his huge, old, priceless shoes? From me. You would be unfit if it were not for me. - What are you talking about? - I'm saying your new job, you wouldn't be able to do it without what I taught you. - What you taught me? - Yes. - I--but, you know, what we do here, it's for fun. It's not, you know-- - What? - Real. - Hal. - It's not. It has nothing to do with the real world, and that is what I love about it. - You don't look it, but you really are so stupid. - I don't want to play right now. - I'm not. - So what do you think you taught me? - You know. - I don't. Confidence. - By doing everything you tell me to do? By submitting to you, that taught me confidence? - Okay, when you first emailed me, when we first met, you were like this. You were like this. Meh-meh-meh-meh. And you could barely speak. Now look at you. Look at you. You write me a script and you tell me exactly what I should say and exactly what I should do. You don't even fucking know what happened. I taught you how to ask for what you want. You couldn't do that before you met me. - I thanked you. And I meant it. And if I have been disrespectful in any way, then I apologize. - An apology? What am I supposed to do with that? - Okay. I also-- I got you a gift also, by the way. - The watch? - Yeah, the... - This is what, um, $15,000? $17,000? - $32,000. - $32,000? You own 112 hotels. Your market cap is $185 million. What is $32,000 compared to what you have? You want to talk about matching up your insides to your outsides? Do you want to talk about who around here knows what it takes to win? - Okay, what do you want? - I want what I'm worth relative to what you have. A real number. - I don't--what does that mean? - Half. - Half? - Half of the salary for the first year of the job that I got you. You how much is that? - That's, like, $4 million. - Okay, good. - Oh, is that good? You're insane. - It's what I deserve. - No, I'm not doing that. And I don't think I could do that even if I wanted to. - Yes, you are. You are doing it. - Or what, you fucking nutjob? - Or I'll tell. - Okay. Like, can we just slow down for a second? - I'm dead serious. - I can see that. - So what's your answer? - What, to your offer of blackmail? I'm gonna pass. - People are watching your company right now. This transition, it would be a story. "Heir to hotel fortune shoves cotton swab "into own penis when commanded. Denver dominatrix tells all." - See, to me, that doesn't quite have the air of hard-hitting journalism. - Okay. how about, "CEO material Hal Porterfield "paid a woman to spit on him and call him a racist pervert with a huge, useless dick." - I don't-- what do those two things have to do with each other? - "In an email obtained, Porterfield seeks "to clarify that the woman of question "is of pure Ashkenazi Jew descent, "going so far as to obtain a saliva sample "so that he could perform a genetic test. "She later read the results of the test aloud to him "while he milked himself into a loofah that he claimed was taken from his own mother's shower." Well, I mean, when you say it like that, it makes it sound weird. - Why are you smiling? - Because this isn't the 1990s, and no one cares what I do with my money or what I shove in my dick on my own time, okay? If anything, it's gonna make me seem open-minded and clued in and fucking cool. - The board is gonna think this is cool? - It doesn't matter what the board thinks. - Ha! - It's set up already. - I knew it, you fucking idiot. You said that you didn't have a board. You said that's not how you're structured. - No, what I--what I meant was we have a-- - No, I know what you meant. I know what you meant. You wanted me to feel stupid and out of my depth, but I'm not. So this board, which exists, do they know your company's motto? - Do they what? - Do you know your company's motto? - Uh, yes. "Some things never change." Some things never change. Nothing weird, nothing unexpected is gonna happen here. So how is that gonna square with you paying for degenerate no-contact sex? - So I'll change the motto. - Mm, change the motto "Some things never change." - Yes, and I promise, no one on the board is gonna say a thing. - Fine. Do you want to settle this really quickly? You don't care what anybody thinks, and I can tell anybody that I would like to? - That's right. - Okay. So then let's send a video of what we do here to everybody on the board. - That's, um... not how blackmail works. - No? - No. You don't ask for money and then propose to make a dirty video. You want to try to go ahead and make that dirty video first. Hi. I'm not quite done. Can we talk about this in a little bit? It's just something. I'm not being difficult. I told you already. Something came up. No, because I just don't see the urgency in it. - Hal. That's what I did. I already made a video. - I'm saying no. Hey, can you listen to me? I trust your opinion, and I trust your taste. So, you know, if you like the cake, then obviously, I'm gonna like it too. - There's a camera hidden in this hotel suite, and I have hours of footage. You can hear what we're saying. You can see your face. You can see everything. - Uh... - She really should know. She ought to know what kind of man she's marrying. - Oh, Mom, will you please just listen to me? All I'm saying is I just need a couple minutes, and then we can talk about it. - It's your mother. - Okay. Well, I'm sorry I yelled. I just needed-- okay. Yes. Bye. It's a, um, dinner for my, uh-- - Your ascension. What do you think she's gonna say when she sees it? - You're a fucking liar. - I'm not. - Tell me you're kidding. You hid a camera in here? You filmed our sessions secretly? - Show me the camera. Rebecca... Where is the fucking camera? - If you want to see it so bad, then fucking find it. - Cold. - I said cold. - Hey, Hal, do you not understand how this game works? - Whoo! - There we go. - There we go. Warmer. - Warmer. You're warming up now. - What are you doing? You're losing momentum. Weather's not changing, my friend. - Warmer. The sun is up. Can you feel it? - I'm not sure how there'd be a camera in there, but I like your energy. Okay. Back to the lamp idea. Warmer-ish. Whoo! - Hal, imagine how satisfied that board is gonna be. Everything that they suspected about you, it's true. You're a fuckup. You're a clown. - Yeah. But I'll still be me, and you'll still be you, doing your own laundry, on your knees, scrubbing your own toilet, Sunday nights in the bathtub eating vegan ice cream because you're fucking lactose intolerant. - Colder. - TV. That's gotta be it, right? - You're right. I do scrub my own toilet, and I don't like it. But you want to know what the real difference between me and you is? - Yeah, I just told you, you crazy bitch. It's embarrassing not having any money, but it's more embarrassing when you do have everything, like you do, and you still feel like trash, and you still feel ashamed, because you just know, to a certain degree that whatever it is that some men have, that magic, your whole life has been proof that you don't have it. Break in the clouds. The sun, she's shining again. White hot. White hot. - Ah, fuck. - Blazing hot. - Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. - You see how hot? The commitment and the focus. - Where is it? - So close! I swear to God! Uh, uh, uh. Mm-mm. Colder now. - How can I be colder? It's a hole in the wall! - I meant that you were on the right track philosophically. - What the fuck does that mean? Oh, fuck. Hal? - You're fucking with me, right? Please just tell me. - No. I don't think it's worth getting killed over. But no, I'm not fucking with you. I'm sorry, baby. - Why are you doing this to me? - Hal. - What? - You're hard right now. - No. No. - I can see it, Hal. - Please just stop. - How can you possibly be hard right now? I mean, what the fuck is wrong with you? You love this. - I know that you think I'm, like, this harmless little bitch. But if I wanted to, I can get rid of you. It's easy as that. - Well, you're right there. I do think you're a harmless bitch. You think it's all cute. You think you're my friend. You're not my friend. You're trash. You mean nothing to me. And I will make you regret treating me like this, because the truth is, it is easy to get rid of you. It would cost less than that watch. - Okay. - What does that mean, "Okay"? - It means I was lying. There's no video. Okay. Good. That's what I thought. Now get the fuck out of here. Just to be clear about something, you didn't teach me anything. I wrote the scenes. You just said the words. It could have been anybody. - You're wrong. The words don't matter. They help. They're like wallpaper or decoration. They're nice, but they're not what's really going on. - Okay. So then tell me what is going on. - You want to be reprimanded for what you fear are inherent flaws and then rewarded for coming into compliance. - If you say so. I pledge allegiance... To the flag... - This is funny. - Of the United States of America... And to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God... Indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. You are good at what you do. But that doesn't change the nature of our relationship. I pay you to make me feel a certain way. I--I do it. And if I stop wanting to feel that way, then I stop paying you, and I don't. It's up to me. - Take off your pants. - No. - Take off your pants... so I don't have to keep punishing you. - And I am saying no. - Stop me. - You're holding a knife to my neck. - Okay. So take it. Take this knife. You're stronger than I am. Take it. Tie me up. Come on, please. - I should. - How about this? Just say to me that you don't care what I want and that it's not the most important thing to you. Say that, and I'll stop. Pull down your pants. It's the only good thing about you. I'm going to use this... because it belongs to me. - And you... are going to be quiet and cooperate. - You know, you say all this shit to me, what kind of a person I am, but you're a bad person too. You're fucking evil. - When I tell you. Not before. You're gonna come inside me. But I want to tell you something first. I have an app on my phone, and it tells me when I'm ovulating. I'm ovulating right now. And when I tell you to come, you're gonna come inside me. You're gonna do it, and you're gonna make me pregnant. And I'm gonna have the baby. A boy. And every single night, you're gonna put him into bed, and he's gonna look up at you, and he's gonna smile. You're gonna thank me for the life I've given you. Say that's what you want. Do it and I'll let you come. - I understand. That's what I want. - Okay, you can come now. - I'll pay it. Half-- half my salary for the first year, and half my bonus. $6 million. - What are you doing? - I'm getting it set up. The lawyer has to do it. - "Hey, Gary. Weird ask. "Can you please deposit $6 million into the following account?" Are you joking? - What? - You can't just wire it to me, Hal. The IRS is gonna be living at my house. - No. Gary will figure it out. He's really good. - Here's what you're gonna tell Gary. He's gonna set up two corporations in the Caymans, one for you guys, one for me. You should be typing. - Okay. - He'll transfer the money there quarterly in divisions under $1 million. Got it? - The Caymans. That's a tax shelter, right? - Yeah. Send that. I know where to find you if this Gary... - Yes. - Doesn't exist. - You do. - And what-- what you said before, is that what you want? To have a kid? - Um, no. I said that because you were wrong and I don't like losing arguments. - Oh. - And I have endometriosis. So it's very unlikely I'll be able to have children. - Oh. - Have a good rest of your weekend. - Okay, you do the same. - Hi. I can't really talk right now. Alexander. Alexander, I can't hear you. Because you're crying. No. No, there's nothing that you can do. You can call again if that helps, but this is the last time that I'm gonna pick up, okay? Goodbye. - Hi. - Hi. - Um, I was-- I was thinking about something that you said. - I promise you, Hal, I cannot get pregnant. - No, not that. You said that you know where to find me. - I do. But you sent the email, right? - Well, yeah. But then it occurred to me, what's to stop you from just doing this again? Like, what's to stop you from coming back next month, like-- - I guess you'll have to take my word for it. - Well, I was thinking that-- that I need, um, something from you, something equivalent that can prevent you-- - Collateral. - Yes, collateral. Exactly. Um, collateral. Yes, something solid. Something important to you. - I get what you mean, Hal. - Okay. - But you already sent the email, right? - I'll--so? I'll send another one. I'll say, "Please disregard." He doesn't care. - What happened to all your smug money confidence? Didn't seem like this even mattered to you. - It didn't, and then it occurred to me that you can do this again and again and again for years, and then I have to see-- um, go over this again and again, and I'm not prepared to do that. - To see me again? - Hey. No, it's not personal. I mean, it's like a-- financially, it's a little insane. - Okay, so here's the new deal. Fuck your collateral. - What? - Fuck your collateral. - Hold on. - And no. I give you no assurance that I won't be doing this again. - Rebecca. - In fact, if I were you-- - We need to talk seriously. - Oh, I'm being serious. - Okay? Please? - I give you no assurance. And if I were you, I would start thinking about ways to keep me happy, like, in perpetuity if dealing with me is so disgusting too you. - No--what does that mean, perpetuity? - It means forever, Hal. - Yeah, I know. I mean, what do you mean? - Oh, okay. See, I'm not the writer. So you might have to do some thinking on your own. But off the top of my head, it's something like a position. - A posi--a position? - A position, yeah. - What? - At the company. Good salary. - No. - Good benefits. Reasonably sized staff. - What? - Office near yours. - No. We--we are not talking about that. - Well, that's what I'm talking about, and that is the only thing that matters. - Hey. Hold on. - You can think it over and come back to me. It can be a discussion. - I'm sorry. Whoa. No. Stop. Time out. Go back. Okay? Let's go back. We're gonna go back now. Six--I'll give you the $6 million, okay? If, and only if, you tell me one damaging piece of information about yourself. - That whole thing has bloomed and died, my friend. - No, it hasn't! - We are in a whole new world now. We are talking about where, in relation to yours, my office is going to be. - No. - And we need to start talking about my title. - What? No! We are not talking about that. Are you insane? - Would it be weird if we were co-CEOs? - Yes. - Has anybody done that? - No. No. We are not doing that. - Well, maybe we're not doing exactly that, but we are doing something like that. - No. No. - Yes. - No. - Yes. That's the result of you coming out here and opening your wormy little mouth trying to extract... - Shut up. - Some concession when... - Shut-- - You have zero leverage! - Shut up. Come here. - Ow! Stop it, you fucking clod! - I just want to talk. - Rape! - Just go back in the room. - Rape! Somebody help me! I'm being raped! Oh, my God. Ow! Rape! - What the fuck are you doing? - Do you think anybody called the cops? I was really screaming out there. - Look, all I want to do is just figure out a way that we can end this so that we both can be sure that it is over. - Okay. - That is all I want. - Okay. Okay. Okay. I told you, I need security. I need a position at the company. - Are you insane? Are you insane? Oh, my God! I don't know what you're doing! - I'm fighting, Hal. It's how you win something, in case you were wondering. So what? You're not gonna give me a job? - No. Yes, correct. Rebecca. - Mm-hmm. Rebecca. is this your new CEO? - What are you doing? - Tweeting the video. - Oh, my God. There is no video! There is no camera! You told me that! - I lied. - Why did you do this? - You wouldn't believe me. - I trusted you with everything about me. Get up already. I knew you were like this, you fucking limp pent-up serial killer! - Fuck. What's the code? - Fuck you, Ted Bundy. - Rebecca, what is the code? - Bill Clinton piece of shit. - Look at it, Rebecca. Rebecca, look at it. Fuck! You are putting me in an impossible situation. You are making it impossible for me and you to walk out of here, which is what I want. - What are you trying to say? - I don't know. The people I work with, my family, my mother, they--they just cannot see that video. Okay? - Why are you so scared of them? - Because they don't know me! This is supposed to be mine, the only thing that is actually mine, God damn it! I offered you money, more than you can make in two lifetimes. I got you a gift. What do you want? What do you want? Do you want to be CEO of a hotel company? - No. - Okay, please--please, then God, just tell me. Do you want me to beg? I will beg you. Please, do not ruin my intolerable, pointless life. Just take your money and just leave me to it. Okay? I don't--do you even know why you're doing this, or is this just the game? - Yes. - Which one? Which is it? - I know what I want. I want to play this game. - I don't--I don't understand. - I quit my job. - What job? - I quit this job, dominating. I fired my broker. I haven't seen a client in months. I'm living off of my savings. - Why? - It felt disloyal. - Disloyal to who? To me? - I had a fiancé, Alexander. I ended it. I broke up with him. He's fucking furious. He has no idea. - Because you felt disloyal to me? - Yes. To us. To--to what we do here. I'm sorry, okay? I know. I get it. You want me to be in charge. - Stop. - I know this is painful for you. Hal, after our first session... - Please. - Do you remember you had me... - Stop. - Do the thing with the fucking cuticle clippers? I went home and I couldn't sleep. I couldn't sleep all night. I was shining. And then you called me again and I got that very same feeling, like when you win something, like you just know that you're gonna get what you want. I thought it would go away. I did. I thought it would go away. But it didn't. It got worse and worse. Why do you think that I started taping the sessions? It was for me. - Stop. - So that I could have them. We're suited to each other, Hal. What we do here, what happens, it's magic. - No. No. No. No. You are not gonna do this. I'm so tired. You're not gonna mind fuck me like this. - Why are you pretending like you don't know what I'm talking about? All those people out there in the world and the shit that they do, what is that compared to this? I hate myself when I'm out there. I hate the way I look and the sound of my voice. I hate myself out there. But in here, when I'm with you, I am exactly who I want to be. When I'm in control of you, I-- I am the person that I dreamed I would be when I was young. I am--I'm-- I'm funny, and I'm mean, and I am strong. And I never, never feel like that out there. And it's the same for you. - No. It's not. I hate that I do this. I hate myself. It's shameful. - I unlocked something in you. - How do you know that? - I know. I know that you think that you need to be this person like your dad, who's strong, who looks forward to the future. But that's not you. You are abnormal. And I don't just mean sexually. I mean fundamentally in a way that most people would just find unacceptable. - Sanctuary. - But for me, in here, we fit. - Sanctuary. - For me, in here, we fit perfectly. - Did you hear me? Sanctuary. Sanctuary. Sanctuary! Sanctuary. - Sanctuary what? - Sanctuary! I'm using the safe word. Sanctuary! Sanctuary! Stop! - I'm not playing. - Oh, my God. Will you just give me a fucking break? Please, give me a fucking break. From the moment you walked back in here, you want $6 million. You want to be co-CEO of a hotel company. You are doing a session. - I quit my job. I left my fiancé. It's true. - This isn't real. That's not real. - This is the only thing that is real. Hal. What is this, Hal? - You're gonna stop talking. If you talk again, I'm gonna hurt you. I will. You didn't quit your job. You didn't break up with your boyfriend. The only good thing about me to you is the money. That's the truth. Now say it. - You want me to speak? - I want you to say that. Say it or I will kill you, and then I'll kill myself. Just tell the truth. I am nothing. Just say that. - I have a better idea. We need to play a game. It's the last one. You're gonna-- - Say what I fucking told you to say! We need to play a game. You be you. I'll be your dad. Greet me. I'm your father. I said, "Greet me." I came back from the fucking dead to speak to you, so the least that you could do is say hello. - Hello. - I'm sorry I left you. - He wouldn't say that. - It was beyond my control. Untie Rebecca. - No. No. - Why not? - Because you don't have the power anymore. I do. And you are gonna take back what you said about your job and your boyfriend, and you are gonna delete that fucking video. - Boy, do not test me! Look at this mess you made, you little shit! - This is my fucking place! - I'm sorry. - Shut up! - Where are you? Okay, I get it. Good job. Good game. I lived 78 years here on Earth. Made money. Raised a family. I was a lucky man. I was happy. Thousands of people worked for me. The company I built, homes they bought, food they ate, the clothes they put on their children's back. It was me. When I died, they wept. I saw them crying. I was outside of my body by then. And I could see everything, everything that happened, everything that's still to come. I saw you crying. How scared you were. How desperately you wanted to know that you could do it. Be me. You can't. You are you. You hate yourself. I understand why you do. But that's not gonna change anything. You're nothing like me, and you never will be. Say it. - I'm nothing like you. - And? - And... and I don't have to be. - Hi. - Hey. - I deleted the video. - Oh. Thank you. - I should get going. - Yeah, I should too. Oh, um, do you, uh-- do you want this? - It's not broken? - No. It's waterproof. - Thanks. - Mm-hmm. I'm running late. I have to-- my mom, she wants to discuss... Uh, she's giving a speech at this dinner to, you know, debut me, and uh... It's--it's funny. The thought of, you know, like, what if I just didn't show up? Like, she's just talking and talking, I don't come out. Might be funny. After you. What if I didn't do it? - The job? - Yeah. - Somebody else would, and everything your dad built would belong to them. - Right. - If you hate these people so much, why don't you just get rid of them? - It's not that simple. - Don't tell me what I do and do not know, Hal. You can absolutely get rid of them. It's called management buyout. - Right. Yeah. So what--what-- - Okay, you inherited money from your father, some obscene amount, right? - Yes. - So you take all of that money. The market cap is 185. Can you cover that? - Um, that would be-- that's, like, everything. - So you take all of that money, and then you would buy back the company. Then it's yours. You can do whatever you want. You can fire the board. It doesn't matter. - Managed buyout? - Management. - Management. Right. Is that what you would do? - If I were you? - Yeah. - Yeah, maybe. - What if you were me? - What does that mean? - What if you took the job, not me? - That doesn't-- - You just said, if I do the manager buyback-- whatever--I can do what I want. So I do that, and I make you CEO. - You're scared about saying goodbye, but you don't have to be. - No. Shut up. This could actually work. - Just because I know more about this than you do doesn't mean that I would be any good at this, Hal. It doesn't mean anything. - I grew up around these people. I was raised by one of them. They all dream all day. They read books, they hire coaches, all to be exactly like you. Fucking crazy and vindictive. - I'm only like that at work. - Yeah, this would be your work. - Don't tell me what I want. This is your problem, not mine. - You said that you love who you are when you're playing the game. You can be that person all day, every day. - So I would just go in there and say what I want to do? - And you just bend everyone around to your will, and it doesn't matter if you're right or wrong. It just matters that people listen to what you say. - You want to spend $185 million on this? - Yes. - All of your money? - Yes. - What are you gonna do? - What do you mean? - All day while I'm at work, what are you gonna do? - Nothing. I'll be like, uh, your wife. - Having no job, having nothing important to do all day but wait for somebody to come home? That destroys people. - You're right. I don't know. But listen, I know what it takes to do this job. It's hard, okay? It takes everything. So you're gonna need comfort, support, stability, food, sex, laundry. What do you call the person that does all those things? - A slave. - That is the job that I was meant for. - What are you gonna tell your mom? See? Not gonna work. You can't even, in an imaginary conversation, think about what you'd say to her without almost throwing up. - Wait. - What? - I know exactly what I'd say. - Liar. - I am not lying. I'm fighting. That's how you get what you want. - Oh, okay. What is it then? What would you say? - I'd say... I'd say, "This is Rebecca. "We're in love. She's in charge now."
