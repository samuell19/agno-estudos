How is it? Are you convinced? Yes, we're convinced. OK, I'll go with you. Sir, where are we going? To see your boss. You're magnificent. My boss will definitely hire you. This way, please. OK, let's go. Here. What are you afraid of? Hand it to me now. Sir, what do you want? Black cloth. You said you have to blindfold me. That's right. - Here it is, Ting. - Go on, then. Oh, of course... of course... Please hop on, sir. - Go. - All right. Lau Ming, Wong Gwan, Wong Chi-Ping, Lee Man-Tai Guest Starring Luk Chuen, Fang Fang, Ko Keung, Wong Ching Music composed by Yeung To-Fuo Lyrics by Mak Ching Art Direction by Kam Pui-Ling Assistant Directors: Xu Shiao-Liang, Chiu Liu-Kong Production Manager: Lee Siu-Cheung Props: Lee Ching-Fu Edited by Leung Wing-Chan Sound by Cheung Wah Stunt Directors: Jackie Chan, Luk Chuen Photography Director: Chan Wing-Shu Lighting: Hui Muk-Wong Master Ting, this is the place. I can't find my way blindfolded. Get me a stick. What? A stick? I promise not to hit anyone with it. Master Ting, I have nothing to do with this. I know your boss is testing my Kung Fu. Let's go. This way... It's here. Master Ting, please wait a moment. Hey, if you don't remove my blindfold now, I might really become blind. This place is quite impressive. Such good wine and food, but no one's touching it. You're overly cautious. You're my invited guest, I won't poison you. I'm used to my own chopsticks. I'm Lam Nan. Lady Nan... I'm very different from the big bosses you've met, aren't I? You didn't invite me here just to wine and dine me, right? I've been hearing the name Ting Chung for a long time. You're brave and good at Kung Fu, you're a busybody but a fair judge, you fight a lot and hardly ever lose, not many people can beat you, even if you're blindfolded... That's why you're the one. - The one for what? - The one to die for us. I won't die. If a cat has nine lives, I've got eighteen. How many lives do you have left now? I don't keep track. I've got more than one. You certainly do... One is my brother's and one is mine. Where do you want me to deliver your lives? - The Stormy Mountains. - Are you crazy? I'm not crazy. My younger brother is very ill. If I can't get him to the capital to Yip the physician in three days, I'll have to watch him die. The only way to get there in time is through the Stormy Mountains. Do you know how many bandits there are in the Stormy Mountains? They'll want your body, your money and your lives. That's why I'm hiring you to be our bodyguard. Money is no object. Just name your price. How much do you think my life is worth? I'll pay whatever you ask. I have no price. I might be worthless. I'm curious. Why pick me? As you have so many lives, only you would agree to be our bodyguard. You're right. You've found a lunatic to die for you. This lunatic doesn't work for money or lives. - What do you work for? - Nothing. - Why are you agreeing to go? - You'll never guess. I've also employed a few highly skilled assistants. - You'll lead them. - Can I meet them? Certainly. Lady Nan. Here they are. They're all very well trained. I'll pick just a few. You... you... You... you... You and you... Those I've picked stand over here, the rest stand there. Those I picked can work as porters. The rest can go now. What? Work as porters? That's what you're fit for. Ting, are you doing this to deny us the chance to make some money? What's the use of money if you'll die while making it? You can't get rid of us this way. What can you do? Any more challengers? With their kind of Kung Fu, they'll surely die on the Stormy Mountains. They're really useless. Would you be OK alone? I have to bring two guys with me. - Who are they? - I don't know. - I have three holes to show you. - Three holes? Look at the first hole. I made this secretly. I was blindfolded but not blind. Look at these two holes. If I was really blind, these two holes would be on my body. I'd like to have these two fighters with me. - Do you think they're of use to you? - Definitely. You've got taste. You picked the two beautiful ones. Beautiful ones? Sisters, come and meet the famous Ting. On our way! The formidable Twin Swords. I'm impressed. It's our honor, Master Ting. Well done. How do you know of them? I've known of the Twin Swords for a long time. We can't go to the Stormy Mountains without them. Can we set off now? - Not yet. I need one more helper. -Who is he? Chang, the deaf guy at the city gate who repairs leather. - The deaf guy? What use is he to us? - He's very useful. This way. - Here? -Yes. Here. Here. Hit it! You're the leather repairman? Is there another reason you sent for me? What kind of skin do you specialize in? I do them all, except for human skin. How could he hear me with all the drumming? He was reading your lips. He knows how to lip-read. Long time no see, Brother Chang. Brother Chang! Brother Chang, why do you always run from me? You always bring bad news. - You're quite right. - There you go. You can't run. We've got a business deal. - Like what? - We're trading... our lives. Where? - The Stormy Mountains? - Yes. We really need your help, Chang. - Are you going? - How could I refuse such an offer? It's late now. What are we waiting for? For the women. They're usually late. We can set off now. Come and get the sedan chair. I thank you in advance for this journey. Why is the sedan chair so wrapped up? He might suffocate. - He can't be exposed to the wind. - Or he can't face anyone. If he gets worse, who will be responsible? Don't forget that she's our boss. The boss is always right. Let's go. - I entrust our affairs to you. - Rest assured, Lady Nan. Let's go. Stop. The Town of Flags is straight ahead. Beyond are the Stormy Mountains. Brother, you go and check the place out. There's nothing to check out. No one's been brave enough to go to the Stormy Mountains in ten years. So there's no reason to go to the town. It's a ghost town. I know of someone living in this ghost town. -Who is it? - The Old Lady of Mar Po Inn. That monster who can hardly walk? I also know that some people visited this town recently. Hey, Old Lady! Finally, I've got customers. Sir, what would you like to eat? A spring chicken, pork liver, steamed prawns and a bottle of wine. - I don't have... - What don't you have? Spring chicken, pork liver, prawns and wine... I don't have any of it. Why did you have them on the menu? We had them earlier. You're too late. How late are we? Ten years too late. For the past ten years, I haven't had a single customer. Where could I get the money to buy meat and wine? - What do you have now? - Egg fried rice. - And? - Rice fried egg. Which one do you want? Both. Sir, you're such a kind man. Two taels of silver. Pay up now. What? Two taels of silver? Customers are rare here. We have to make up for the previous years. Thank you, sir. And you two? - Here you go. - Take this, too. Thank you. Welcome, everyone. Welcome. No wonder the birds are singing. The god of fortune is sending customers. It's more like the work of the gods of misfortune. Strange. They paid for the rice, but no one is eating. That's all right, I can keep it for the rest of the week. Cowards! Shame on you. I presume you all know of me? You must be the God of Darts, Wu of a Thousand Hands. Right. You robbers are afraid of just one man. Tsang. Did he invite you here? He demanded half of your spoils. Any opposition will be skinned alive. Am I right? - Am I right? -Yes, yes, yes... Don't worry. With me around, he won't dare to even touch you. But... I need to collect a protection fee. How much do you want? A 3-7 split. - You take 30%? - I want 70%. What? You want more than Master Tsang? I'm the God of Darts. Who is he? What about you? Wu, these things can't touch me. Come out here. I'll only take half your spoils. First come, first served. He's back. - Did you see anything? - Yes, I did. What did you see? - Wu of a Thousand Hands. - The God of Darts? He not only lost his hands, he lost his life and skin as well. The God of Darts is highly skilled. Who is more skilful than him? He also deals with skin, but not the type I deal with. What's the difference? I repair all kinds of skin except human skin. - And him? - He doesn't repair, he only skins... and he only skins humans. But he doesn't skin good people. I know. He must be the famous Tsang. Thank you, Master Tsang. Neither of us have enough. What shall we do? I'm very old now, but you're still young. If you take mine, you'll have enough. Uncle, I can't do that. You've got a wife and kids. I'm single and no one will miss me if I die. Take mine and you'll have enough. - That's no good. - It doesn't matter. Take it. Stop the hypocrisy! I've never seen a considerate robber. I hate the likes of you. If you don't come in now, I'll skin you two. Uncle, you go. -I can't. - I'm serious, Uncle. You go. What about you? Congratulations, you two can go now. -Go? - That's what he said. He's letting us go? Why are you so dense? Can't you tell? I know him well. He's normally a man of few words. If he scolds you, you're in luck. Ting, when did you become such a busybody? Ask them to go now. What did he say? - You two can go now. - Go, go, go... Thank you, thank you. Thank you, thank you. Does he always scold people? No, it's easier for him to kill than to scold people. Hey! Are you coming out, or do we have to come in and carry you out? What now? He's smarter than me. What? He's left? Don't worry, we'll find him. - Hey, what are you doing? - I need a ride. - There's someone inside. - Dead or alive? If he's alive, tell him to get out. - He's very amusing. - Hilarious. Stop! Brother Tsang, please be kind. How are you, Big Brother? He's bad news, but you can't ignore me, right? It's been two years since we last met. How are you doing? So-so. I know you won't go. You know I'll drag you in. Do you want to see who we're protecting? - Who? - My brother. He's seriously ill. Come with us to the mountains. It'll be fun. Do you think he'll go? He killed the God of Darts, so he will. Why? Wu was the lover of Lady Liu of the Stormy Mountains. He'd rather go look for Lady Liu than wait for her to come seeking revenge. Ten thousand taels of silver and two jars of good wine. Is that all you want? Ten thousand taels of silver? I'll pay. A bond of ten thousand taels of silver and the finest Nu Er Hong wine as my gifts to you. I'm Tsang Mo-Yi, third in the family. - Your father is Tsang Man-Tien. - Yes. Good wine must be shared. Drink with me? Certainly. Go on. Wonderful wine. More. Are you going to the Stormy Mountains? Your whole family died doing that. Do you want to die like them? No. The bandits of the Stormy Mountains are managed by four deputies. One is called the Scholar, the second is called Fake Monk, the third is called Old Wolf and the last is Lady Liu. I'll keep that in mind. The four of them may be powerful, but I think you can deal with them. But if you met the Lord, I'm not sure you'd survive three of his moves. Who is he? Did you know that I had a lover? Look at this portrait of me when I was young. Though I wasn't exquisite, I was considered beautiful. So he loved me. He loved my cooking and visited me often. He hasn't been visiting lately, but I believe he'll come soon. I'll wait for him until the end of time. Do you know who he is? The ruler of the Stormy Mountains, Lord Chu. Lord Chu? You're drunk. Good wine is hard to come by. You're a good kid. I don't want you to die there. This is for you. - What can it do? - It can save lives. In the mountains, give this to a man with six fingers on his left hand. He can save your lives. Thank you. There's no need for that. Be off with you. ♪ When the spring comes ♪ Hundreds of flowers start to bloom ♪ In a garden of hundreds of flowers ♪ I wait alone... The Stormy Mountains are a menacing place. If you don't want to die there, you have to follow the rules. Follow the rules? From now on, I'm leading the expedition. Do not leave the group without my permission and be quiet at all times. - No drinking, either. - Can we be flexible on the drinking? If you break any rules, I'll skin you alive. Big Brother, I'll follow all your rules. Let's go. Move out! ♪ The lofty, undulating Stormy Mountains ♪ As hard to conquer as the sky ♪ Dangers and obstacles along the way ♪ Like the path leading to the gate of hell ♪ The four deputies guard the corners ♪ Lord Chu's skills are hard to counter ♪ The Stormy Mountains may be our graves ♪ Fast and furious, the Iron Fist ♪ Spreading virtue and stifling vice ♪ Friends to share our woes and worries ♪ We'll sacrifice to do our duty ♪ Tsang is a fighter whom few can match ♪ Chang is deaf but his eyes are sharp ♪ Together, as one, we'll conquer the Stormy Mountains ♪ The lofty, undulating Stormy Mountains ♪ As hard to conquer as the sky ♪ Friends to share our woes and worries ♪ We'll sacrifice to do our duty ♪ Tsang is a fighter whom few can match ♪ Chang is deaf but his eyes are sharp ♪ Together, as one, we'll conquer the Stormy Mountains ♪ Pretend you didn't see them. Go on. Read their lips and see what they're talking about. They said that we'll never get out of this place alive. There could be another ambush ahead. Be careful. This is only the beginning. Anyone want to quit? Tsang, we don't need cynicism. None of us here are quitters. Sister, that's rude. He has no faith in us. You're not afraid to die? Good on you. Let's run across! Listen. - What's up? - Someone's shouting for help. I can't hear it. I heard it too. It's coming from over there. They'll be victims of the robbers in these parts. Nonsense, I don't see anything. Are you blind? There are so many wounded there. I can't see them. Don't forget we still have a long way to go. How can we leave them here to die? Sister, let's go and see. - They've fallen for it. - Right. - They're faking it. - Faking? They said we've fallen for it. Guard the sedan. Drop your weapon, or I'll kill her! Let's help them. No need, Tsang can deal with it. Come here. I know you're the skinner. Do you dare to skin me? Maybe... not. Come any closer and I'll kill her. If she dies, you'll die as well. Let her go. I said let her go. Let her go! - Now get lost! - OK. He was so fierce a moment ago, Sister. Look how obedient he is now. - Go thank that gentleman. - OK. Thank you for saving my life. Serves you right. Didn't I tell you to get lost? What are you waiting for? Go! Mister, thank you for saving my sister. It's my pleasure, ladies. Courtesy is a way of life. Take this! I'm Wan Leung Yoke. I'm familiar with your reputations. Your visit has livened up this uneventful place. Mr Wan, what is it you really want to say? The Stormy Mountains are full of danger. If you don't want to die, be careful. Mr Wan, why are you being so kind to us? I'm concerned about my assets. What you're guarding will soon be mine. Come and get it, then. Robbers also have standards. Courtesy before aggression. I'll be back tomorrow. Hope you survive the night. Bye for now. See you tomorrow. Chasing your enemy is foolish. As you're still young, I'll forgive you. If you leave the group again, I'll skin you alive. You lot stay here to guard the sedan. Let's check the place out. It's strangely quiet here. Big Brother, this must be the Luo Han Temple. The candles are lit. There must be monks here. I'll go get them. Did you say we're in the Luo Han Temple? Haven't you seen those eighteen Luo Han Buddhas there? Eighteen Luo Han Buddhas? The weapons in their hands are different from the Luo Han Buddha's. Could be another ambush. Let's get out of here. Get out. - I can't take it any more! - Me either! - How do we get out? - We'll be carried out as corpses! Hey, what are you two doing? - We'll be dead soon! - You'll die with us! Me, die with you? Fine. BUDDHA No one escapes from the Chamber of Monster Bells. Sifu, the three of them will stop breathing soon. This is Ting Chung. He's got the world's fastest punch. What a pity that I won't get to witness it. Now you'll get to witness my stinking feet. Now you'll know how fast I can punch. Let's get out of here! They won't give up that easily. We'll be in more danger if we don't escape. I'm worried about the ones outside. - Let us out. - OK. That way! I waited here just like you said to, so am I a good girl? Cut that crap out. What took you so long? I was worried for you guys. This place isn't safe. Let's go. Please don't worry. I'm a businessman, not a robber. Don't be afraid. There's nothing to worry about. You're safe here. I really am a businessman and not a robber. Don't worry. Doing business in the Stormy Mountains? I'm the only one doing it. With so many robbers, what business can you have? Even robbers need to eat and drink. I make their lives here bearable. So they let me run a small business here. It's getting dark soon. It's lucky you met me, or you wouldn't get any peace tonight. Is there a peaceful place in the Stormy Mountains? - There's only one. -Where is it? Peace Hotel. That's my place. Shameless self-promotion. You only care about our money. I can guarantee your safety, but I only welcome certain kinds of people. - What kind of people? - Rich people. Only the very rich, because I do charge more than your average hotel. How much more? 20 to 30 times more. That's daylight robbery! I can't help it. I don't have many customers. What kind of people are you, may I ask? - Rich people. - That's right. We're filthy rich. That's wonderful. This way, please. I assure you, you'll feel safe and peaceful as soon as you're inside. I have an agreement with the robbers. - Boss, you're back. - Yes. Ask them to keep quiet. Stop! Sir, I thought we'd agreed that you'd let me run my business in peace. But they're not inside your hotel yet. Who killed my brother, Iron Wolf? I did. So you're the skinning swordsman. Did you kill my brother with that sword? I don't have to draw this sword to defeat scum like you. You sure talk big. Come over, I'll avenge my brother today. Big Brother, let me deal with him. I'm second, I'll be next in line. Stand aside. Let's play. Who are you? A leather repairman. What weapon do you use? Legs. Legs? It's not fair. That's to your advantage. Move back! Impressive kicks. I've been walking the whole day, so my feet might smell. Time to vomit? Enter, please. Your Kung Fu isn't quite there yet. Get lost. Let's go. Everything is fine now. Please go in. Look how spacious and peaceful my place is. You'll like it. - Which is the biggest room? - That one. Can I carry the sedan to the room? What? You want to carry the sedan into the room? That's what I just asked you. Of course you can. Rich people can do whatever they like. - Bring the sedan in. - OK, come in, please. - This way. - Come in, please. - Be careful. - Slowly... - That's the way. - Straight through... Staff, brew some nice tea and prepare some food. They're filthy rich, give them the best service. Please knock before entering my room. I'm here to ask you something. - Is it about the sedan? - Something's fishy about it. What's so fishy about it? Have you ever seen anyone carrying a sedan into a room before? I thought the patient couldn't be exposed to the wind. I wonder if it's the wind, or if it's that he can't expose his face. - Are you curious? - Aren't you? Let's go, then. Can you sleep comfortably in the sedan? There's no wind here. Come out for a chat. What are you doing here? No one's around. I stayed to find out what's happening. Big Brother, what's going on? - Let's discuss this outside. - OK. Big Brother, do you know what they're up to? I'm risking my life guarding an empty sedan. How do you know it's empty? You saw it before. I didn't see anything. I was sleeping in my room. I didn't see anything. I was sleeping in my room, too. They're definitely smarter than me. Dinner for 14 costs 135 taels of silver... Water costs five taels, candles five taels, and toilet paper... Boss, hurry up, please. We've got a long way to go. I'm a fair businessman. I need to charge you accurately... - Pearl... - What do you need? Get me some medicine. Quickly. It's 245 taels of silver in total. Your place is really pricey. I've been very fair, I told you in advance that we're expensive. You're our best guests. Please come again. Fat chance. - Let's go. - What's the rush? Have some hot tea before you go. It's half-price. - Let's go. - Have a safe journey. - Quick. - All right. - Big Brother. - What? - Did you see? - See what? - There's someone in the sedan. - Did I say it was empty? - Why didn't he meet us? - Why must he meet you? Big Brother, this way is very dangerous. What choice do we have? This is the only way through the Stormy Mountains. Wan. He's really waiting for us. Glad to see you again. You look fresh and well rested. You must have slept comfortably. You seem to care a lot about us. I don't care about you. I care about the assets of mine you're guarding. On what condition will you let us through? - My conditions are simple. - Spit it out. I'll keep the treasure, he'll keep the ladies... He? Who's he? Amitabha... He's me... I'm him. That's how it works in the Stormy Mountains. We split equally. So you'll split it equally? What about the other men here? Each of the men must leave a hand here. It's up to you which hand. You're a scholar. We're simply passing through. Is there room for negotiation? I always mean what I say. End of discussion. What if we disagree? It's up to you. You have till the afternoon to consider your options. Don't be foolish. If you don't believe me, just take a look... This is our territory. Unless you meet our demands, you must suffer the consequences. Retreat! Big Brother, we can make a run for it. You might be able to. What about the rest? At least we could try. We can't take that chance, unless it's our last resort. What can we do now? There's one person who can help us. Who is he? I don't know. All I know is that he's got six fingers on his left hand. Six fingers? Oh... six fingers? - Where can we find him? - He might know. - The hotel owner? -Yes, I'll go look for him. If you see the six-fingered man, give him this. He'll save us. How will you get out of here? You guys have to cover me. Why did you grope me? I'd rather be with that monk than you! When did I touch you? - I'll teach you to harass my sister! - Stop being unreasonable! - How dare you? - Stop, please! - Mister. - My beloved guest. You're here again. What business are you bringing me this time? I've got some unusually big business for you. I thank you in advance. How many guests? It's not accommodation... I want to sell you something. Something to sell me? What is it? Someone's life. - Whose life? - Yours. My life belongs to me. It's mine now. Do you want it back? It's no use threatening me. I grew up with robbers. Is it because I overcharged you and you want your money back? - I don't want money. - What do you want, then? - Help us cross the mountains. - Cross the mountains? I don't know of anyone who's made it across the Stormy Mountains alive. You'd have to cross with Lord Chu's blessing. - Take me to see Lord Chu. - Me? I'm not that influential. I'm just a businessman. Why are you doing this? Help me look for someone. -Who is he? - A six-fingered man. - Why are you looking for him? - I have something for him. Bring me to Lord Chu. He can't help you, even if you threaten to kill him. I'm the only person who can do that. You must be the notorious Lady Liu? That's right. Are you the one who killed the God of Darts? I'm Ting Chung. So you're the Ting with many lives. The world's fastest boxer. I'm familiar with your reputation. Can you take me to see Lord Chu? Yes, but... you killed my lover, the God of Darts. Find me a replacement. This guy's eloquent and has good business acumen. He'll be a fantastic lover for you. No, I don't like him. Who do you like? I like you. May I have a cuddle? Your punches really live up to my expectations. What else can you do, you bastard? First I'll blind you in both your eyes, then I'll take you home and torture you slowly. You've inhaled poisonous gas. You'll die in a few hours. Luckily I found the antidote on her. You... So it's you. They've been surrounded and their lives are in danger. They must be in Death Valley. Take the antidote, I'll see what I can do. Can you save them? I'm wearing a good-luck charm. I hope it helps. I'll be back soon. Tsang, it's past noon now. Why haven't we had any news? Don't worry. There'll be a way out. Look. - How did you get here? - Don't worry, I'll get you out. Why should I trust you? Look. It's you. Thank you. Let's go with him. Fellows, listen up! They carry Lord Chu's insignia! Let them through. Let's go. Fellows, listen up! They carry Lord Chu's insignia! You have to let them through. Fellows, listen up! They carry Lord Chu's insignia! Please let them through. -How is it? - I've taken them to a safer place. - They can't cross the mountain yet. - Why? No one crosses the mountain without Lord Chu's permission. Take me to Lord Chu. If he doesn't let us through, I'll fight him. - It's no use, unless... - Unless what? Trade in your fists. Is he interested in my fists? Yes, I know that he lacks a pair of fast, strong fists. Sounds like a business deal. Yes, I'm a businessman. I'll make sure you get a good deal. Where are my friends? Only I know where they are. I want to see them first. OK, follow me. Where are they? Are you trying to trick me? Nonsense. Why would I to lie to you? You're too mysterious for me to trust you completely. - This is... - They've definitely been here. - Lady Nan! - Tsang! - Lady Nan! - Tsang! - Lady Nan! - Tsang! NAMO AMITABHA Long live Lord Chu. Rise. Are you Ting Chung? We're helping an ill man across the mountains. Please give us permission. I can't break the rules of the Stormy Mountains just for you. Isn't Lord Chu interested in my fists? If you let us through, you'll have free use of these fists. You may be willing to offer them, but I need to try them out first. I'm not sure if your fists are worth that much. - Iron Man. - Here! He's learned the Thirteenth Prince fighting technique. His left punch is 300 pounds, his right is 500 pounds. Impressive. See if you can handle my Iron Fist. You call these Iron Fists? Lord Chu, I deserve to die... - Begone! -Yes... Thank you, Lord, for sparing my life. Is Lord Chu satisfied with my fists? Yes, if you stay here with us, you'll be handsomely rewarded. What about my friends? Your friends are safe with us. They've just eaten and showered. They're resting now. - Where are they? - There. Sister, look at him. We've been tricked. You lied to me? I haven't lied to you. I was helping the Old Lady of Mar Po Inn to get you out of Death Valley. I'm Lord Chu's man. How could I betray him? I had to bring you here. Don't forget that I hate liars. Tsang, don't threaten me. Have you forgotten where you are? No matter where I am, I'll skin you alive. Big Brother, watch out! How dare you kill my man right in front of me? I haven't killed a man, I killed a mongrel. You don't have much respect for me. I have no wish to offend you. We have no conflict of interest. If you let us through, I'll repay your kindness one day. What if I refuse? We'll have to do it by force. You two are very naive. Luckily for you, I've just struck a deal with your friend, or I'd let you learn from your mistake. - We just need your blessing. - We're not afraid to die. I will settle this peacefully for Ting's sake, but I'll need to know what's in the sedan. It's my brother. He's very ill. Is he really ill? Of course. Why would I lie to you? All right, can I meet him? He can't be exposed to the wind. It'll kill him. Death from wind exposure? I don't believe it. Can't you hear how sick he is? - I must look at him! - I urge you not to disturb him. - Force him out! - Yes! Didn't I warn you not to disturb him? As I expected, the best fighter among you is inside the sedan. Please show yourself. A trivial trick. Get out! - What's happening? - Just watch. It's been five years. We will settle our old scores today. The Old Lady of Mar Po Inn! - It's unbelievable! - How strange... I was forced into hiding for five years, all because of her. Lord Chu, it's our fault that we mistook her for you. Lord Chu, how did it happen? She came to me for help ten years ago. For old times' sake, I let her run the inn in the Town of Flags. I never thought she'd set me up. She used my name for material gains. Lord Chu, how could she sound so similar to you? She'd planned it right from the start and had made a mask of my face. Imitating my voice wasn't a problem for her. She drugged me and tried to bury me alive. I managed to escape and came back to the Stormy Mountains. That's when I realised that there was another Lord Chu. When I went to the inn, the Old Lady was there, too. I was puzzled. To get to the bottom of this, I went underground. What has this got to do with Lady Nan? She's my daughter and had never lived in the mountains. We'd planned this for five years before we got to see the Old Lady. Now the truth is out. I'm here and I'm the rightful Lord. Long live Lord Chu! Health and power to Lord Chu! Father... Uncle Chu. - You may rise. - Thank you, Lord Chu. I thank you for your effort in making this possible. Stay here with me and you'll live in luxury. A life of luxury is not what we seek. Rejecting my offer is not very respectful. I'm sorry, we've not completed our mission yet. What mission? To help you cross the mountains to get to the capital. The Stormy Mountains are home. I'm not going to the capital. - You have to. - Why? You've occupied the Stormy Mountains for nearly 20 years. I must take you to the capital to face justice. Can you? Lord Chu, do you remember that the imperial army tried to retake this place 15 years ago? You killed over a thousand soldiers and General Ting Kwok-Chung. How are you related? He was my father. No wonder you joined this mission with no care for money or your life. There's no way any of you will get out of the Stormy Mountains alive. I must avenge my father's death and rid the world of crooks like you. Father! Run! We'll take it in turn to exhaust him. Big Brother, I got him!
