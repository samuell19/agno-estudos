[insects buzzing] [music playing] [MUSIC - JOHN PHILIP SOUSA, "THE STARS AND STRIPES FOREVER"] DJ (RADIO): Hi,Ellie and happy 4th of July. I hope every one of our listeners is having a great holiday weekend. If you want to catch some fireworks tonight, there'll be displays at 9:00 in Malibu, Venice, and at Dodger Stadium. The time, 4:28 PM. It's 86 degrees at the beaches. And if you're headed in that direction, stick to the surface streets. The 10 and the 405 are backed up in both directions. From the incline to the tunnel, well that, folks, that's a street party. CARL (RADIO): Unit 12 keep heading south along the boardwalk. Unit 8, stay put. Don't take your eyes off that duffel bag. I think this thing's going to be a bust. He's already an hour late for the pick up. So much for the crime hot line. It's like anybody with a phone thinks you're a cop, you know? BEN (RADIO): Read your magazine. Dispatch says 99% of these calls are bogus anyway. I mean, this is bullshit sitting here on the birth of our nation, watching the garbage can. I should be home watching the Cubs kick Philadelphia's ass. BEN (RADIO): There's five kilos in that can, and both of us know that's a five-star bust. What do we get for that, a VCR or a microwave? It's going to get you a paycheck. So keep your mouth shut and do your job. You know you're not the only one making a sacrifice out here. I'm supposed to meet Kate tonight, and it doesn't look like I'm going to make it. Heads up. There's a car approaching. I'll run the plates. What do you know? There's our 1%. CARL (RADIO): Great. At least he's patriotic. Check that can. I'll be right back. Dispatch, this one William seven in pursuit of suspect on Canyon Drive. CARL (RADIO): Ben, the car was reported stolen. Stay with him, but don't spook him. Chief James has backup on the way. Copy. I need an APB on a black sports car. Driver wearing an Uncle Sam mask. Last spotted at Canyon and Sunset. CARL (RADIO): Stay put, Ben. I'm on my way. This is two Baker 12 in pursuit of suspect wearing Uncle Sam mask. He's now headed west towards Venice. This is two Baker 12. All units. Have lost suspect. He's headed back north, towards Washington. [horn honking] Shit! Hey! Hold it up, buddy. Good luck. Thank you. This is wonderful, Kate. Thank you. Just promise me a good story. That's his department. I just take the pictures. Have a good night. Dave. Great job, Kate. You're probably very proud. And I'm glad you kept the art collection. It was always one of my favorite parts of Grayson's. Well, you're one of our favorite guests. Ah. KATE: I mean that. - Thank you. Now, listen. As soon as she's available, I'm going to bring Gloria Pendleton from Andre Magazine. Kudos for me in my Sunday column mean nothing compared to a great review from her. You're gonna have lines around the block. I like the sound of that. Good. Have fun tonight. Have a good time. DAVE: Thanks. Everything OK? Great. She's adjusted that wine glass 10 times already. What gives? Ben [inaudible] if he ever decides to show up. Where is he? It's already 5:00. Who knows? Probably working. Even a national holiday can't stop fearless Ben from fighting crime. Time for another visit from Uncle Sam. Good evening. Welcome to Grayson's. I'm Kate Grayson. When my father first opened Grayson's, he pulled me aside and said, look at how perfect this is. For the guy who's in love, he can have a great meal, listen to some music, and have a romantic evening with his girl. And for the guy that's out of love, he can have a great meal, listen to some music, and pretend like the girl's not even there. [laughter] That's my father's philosophy, not mine. I'd like to propose a toast to my dad, John Edward Grayson. We miss you. We love you. And we'll never forget you. Happy Fourth. Yeah? Carl? It's Jane. You're not going to believe this, but we've got reports of some guy walking around in an Uncle Sam mask. You've got to be kidding me. No. He's down here at the fireworks. It's like a fucking Mardi Gras out here. We're never going to find this guy. You wanna call it a night? CARL: Yeah. Get down! Everybody get down! [gunshots] Shit. It's leaking gas. Carl, come on. [explosion] You OK? Yeah. You dropped the bag. Here. CHIEF: One fireworks display's not enough for you two? We go where the crime is, Chief. CHIEF: Shut up, Carl. And what the fuck do you think you were doing? High speed car chase, a gunfight on a crowded beach? Between the news media and the Mayor's office, I've got one huge pile of shit to deal with, thanks to you. If we would've got the guy, everybody would be patting me on the back now. You want a pat on the back? Fine. So get a massage and your day off. Because I'm suspending you for a week, until I can think of something better. You could be one of our best detectives, but your impulsive decisions are a danger to this department. On your time off, decide what you want to do. Because you can't work with me unless you can think smarter than you act. Did Ben call? Not that I know of. Sorry. KATE: I'll be in my office. Hey, there you are. Where have you been? I was here I was standing around in the shadows. - So, did you hear the band? - Yeah. They were great. What did they play? BEN: I don't know. You know what, honey? I had a really bad night. You know, tonight was kind of special, and I would've really like to have shared it with you, Ben. I got suspended. You what? It's a long story. Is everything all right? I'm still alive. You know, honey, I, I know how much it meant to you that I was here. OK? And I'm saying I'm sorry, but that's not enough. I think you know how I feel about you. What am I gonna do? Jump off a bridge? It's late. Let me close up. Let's go home. Come here. BEN: Don't you think it'd be a lot easier if I had some of my own things here? You know, we've been together now almost what, a year. It'd seem a lot easier if I had some things over here. My dad would roll over in his grave if he knew that you were living here with his precious daughter in sin. Is that a sin? Not even close. [music]: Summer's gone. and the leaves are burning red. It's open season but the deer escaped today. Does this mean I'm forgiven? No. It just means that I love you. BEN: I can't stand this. KATE: What's that? All this free time shit. What am I supposed to do? Sit around watching crappy talk shows and diaper commercials? Such torture. Looks like Chief James found the perfect punishment for you. I have something to make you feel worthy. What's that gonna be? You know that beehive that you said you were going to take down last week? Well it's twice as big and twice as scary. Will you take it down for me? Right after "Regis and Kathie Lee". Thank you. I won't be too late. I'll be home around 10:00. OK. TONYA (PHONE): Hello, Grayson's. Hey. So how'd we do last night? TONYA (PHONE): Hello? Hey! Oh my god! TONYA (PHONE): Are you OK? [sirens] Hey, baby. Hi. What happened? You OK? I don't know. It's a blur. I was talking to Tonya on the phone and then-- I don't know. He came out of nowhere. You hit someone? He's going to be OK. A slight concussion, a bad cut on his leg. But no broken bones. I have some internal tests coming in later. Shouldn't be any surprises. Well, who is this guy, anyway? What was he doing in the street? That's sort of a mystery. He doesn't recall the accident. His name is Gil Draper, and from what we can get out of him it appears he's been living on the streets for quite some time. No immediate family to help out. Unfortunately he also doesn't have insurance. If he's homeless, where is he going to go? DOCTOR: Don't know. Our homeless population is too large for us to have a welfare shelter. There are places he can go. But we leave that up to the patient. Can I see him? What do you mean, can you see him? Listen, I know what you're thinking. I deal with these kind of people all the time. Most of them wish you would have backed up the car and finished the job. Ben. He's been in and out for the past few hours. You're welcome to stay if you want to speak to him. But I'd recommend coming back tomorrow. I'd like to stay. DOCTOR: It could be hours. Let's just go home and think about it. Come back tomorrow, if you want. OK. Let's go. BEN: I've seen a lot of homeless people, you know? They got nothing to lose, and no self-worth. He was waiting for somebody like you come along and take advantage of. People like me. Yeah. Kate, look around. Look at this place, this big house. You got it from your daddy. Cars, jewelry, money. You just gonna let a stranger walk in, stay here? How long is it gonna be before he picks up what he wants and just disappears? It's so sad that you have to think like that. Yeah,it is sad. There's a lot of bad people out there, honey. And unfortunately most of them are in Los Angeles. He has nowhere to go, Ben. The garage is far enough away from the house for me to feel safe. It's not like we're going to be sharing a bathroom together. I just want to give him a place where he can get better, because it's my fault that he's in this condition anyway. It's the least I could do. Hey, what are you doing? Where are you going? I'm going to clear a space in the garage. Saw the dent on your front end. You must be furious. I almost killed the guy. Think I care about some stupid bumper? No, but I'd still make him pay for it. With what? He doesn't have anything. As a matter of fact, he's going to be staying at my house for a while. In the garage. Ugh, that's weird. I mean, oh that is so sweet. No, I know it's weird. It's just that when I was little, and I don't know why I keep thinking about this, but we had this raccoon epidemic in my neighborhood. And they were getting into everything. So my dad set these traps. And one day we heard this animal crying. It was caught but, it was still alive. Except it wasn't a raccoon. It was a dog. It was the cutest little stray. And my dad knew that I'd never get any sleep knowing that his traps had killed this poor little guy. So he rescued it, took it to the vet, fed it, did everything he could do to make up for the mistake, I guess. That was just a dog. So I have to help this poor guy. So what does Ben think about this poor guy? Thinks I've lost my mind. KATE: Are you OK? God, this place is beautiful out here. Thank you. Hey, you know, when the doctor first told me what you plan on doing, I-- At first-- I hate to say this. I thought you were crazy. You weren't the only one. You know, I thought to myself, I don't know who this lady thinks I am. Or what she expects out of me. This is the first time anybody's ever given me a chance, without there being some sort of catch. There is no catch, Gil. Thanks, Miss Grayson. Call me Kate. Gosh. So as you can see, I sort of like to save things. I don't know if this is any better than what you had before, but at least it's safe. Oh no, it's, it's perfect. Jesus. Oh, I'm so sorry. Oh, that's OK. This has been broken for years. I was gonna be a dancer when I was little, so my dad bought me everything he could find with ballerinas on it. It's very nice. So there's some old clothes of my dad's over there in those boxes. Help yourself. This is for you. Miss Grayson? Yeah? Look, I know what it takes to trust a stranger. And I want you to understand that I, I plan on taking this opportunity to prove my worth. And I couldn't be more thankful. Looks like you're gonna have to share. Wildlife has seniority around here. Get some rest. KATE: Oh, I'm so tired. What a long day. Yep. Thanks, babe. Goodnight. ECHO: [inaudible] Now behave. Bit higher, higher. That's it. Hey, you're doing much better. Good, now I'll ask you to bring it to a gallop. [hoof beats] ECHO: Good. Go around the green once. Looks great! OK, now pull back the reins. I want you to cruise to a full stop. [quacking] [buzzing] Hi. Morning. So I see the bees are still having the time of their life. They sure are, yeah. I'll take care of that today. I can't believe that. what's he doing out there? KATE: What's it look like he's doing? He's painting the fence. Well, who does he think he is, Huck Finn? He found some paint in the garage. He asked me if he could help out, and I said yes. You think that's all there is to it? I tell you what. Let's reverse the situation, OK? Let's say I'm driving along and I hit a young homeless girl. And I decide to take her home and give her a place to stay, because I'm a good Samaritan. So the next morning I wake up, and she's painting the fence, topless. I mean, come on. What message is she sending out? That it's a hot day? Or she doesn't want to get any paint on her shirt that she'd been sleeping in for last year? I would've done the same thing for anybody, Ben. Anyone. I'll see you later. Well, you know, be careful driving all right? I mean, one homeless guy around here's enough. Oh, no. Next time I'll aim for a cheerleader. All right, pal. Let's see how you handle a beehive. BEN: That hive up there's been growing for about a year. Kate's scared to of them. Got to cut it down. I'd climb up there and do it myself, but I'm allergic. You know, they're actually quite harmless. They won't attack, unless they're provoked. But I mean if that's what Kate wants, I'd be glad to help out. Yeah. You know, hang on a second. Let's-- we'll do that some other time. We'll start off with something easier. I had to take down a tree over there. it was getting ready to fall over. It was pretty rotten. Started from the inside, you know. Never finished chopping up all this wood. You mind if I give it a whack? You up for it? Let me see. I guess maybe you'll come in pretty handy around here. Hey, look, I know this-- how suspicious this whole thing must seem. Especially, you know, you being a cop and all. I'm just trying to find my way back to a decent life. Good luck. [laughter] Hey, baby. Hi. BEN: How are you? KATE: Good. You know, you'll never guess what he did for a living. He was a general contractor. GIL: No, it's nothing special. A little company up in San Jose. That's what her father did. He was obviously very successful. Maybe you could introduce him to some people. He could get back in the mainstream. No, look, that's not necessary. I'd love to help. All right. You guys hungry? Yeah. Help yourself. Good, good. Dig in. No, thanks, man. I'm gonna, like, let you guys be alone. And maybe I'll, like, catch you in the morning or something. See you tomorrow. - Thanks. - All right. Goodnight. We're like best friends. MAN: Do you do windows, too? What are you doing here? This could blow the whole fucking plan. I came by to see you'd made any progress. Things are going along just fine. Now get the fuck out of here, all right? They're due back here any minute. Have you fucked her yet? Now listen to me, you fuck. I've known this woman my whole fucking life. She ain't no fucking whore. You hear me? I need an apology. Apologize. I need one now. OK. OK, I'm sorry. She's not a whore. OK? I'm sorry. She's not a whore. You listen to me. I've got everything under control. This morning she's taking me to the boardwalk to run some errands, all right? What about Ben? Ben's a bit of a problem. So you're gonna have to murder [inaudible] Now get the fuck out of here. GIL: Hey. Hi. GIL: I found the paint and the sprinkler head. Great. Have a seat. There's some bagels and juice in the bag. You know, I don't want to sound ungrateful, it's just you don't have to do all this work. I can hire somebody to do it. I like working. It makes me feel useful for a change. Just be careful. You need to heal. So what did you get? Where did you find this? Found it in a box in the garage. "Fountainhead." It's pretty dense reading. GIL: I love reading. You know, you don't have to be rich to enjoy a good book. Yeah, this was my dad's favorite book. I think we have, like, 12 of them in the house. When did he pass away? About two months ago. GIL: I'm sorry. Were you two close? Yeah. He was my best friend. You know, you remind me of him. He loved to work around the house. It's a little strange, you wearing his clothes. The book-- Look, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to, like, make you feel uncomfortable or anything. No, it's OK. It's just good to remember him. I'm flattered. Thank you. I gotta go. I gotta get to work. I hope Ben's not giving you too hard a time. No, we're fine. Got a little project planned for this afternoon. Play nice. GIL: I was checking these out last night. BEN: Wow. GIL: Old trail bikes. Think they run? I couldn't get either one to turn over. Probably just a little dirt in the carburetor. That's an easy fix. Pull over here. Is this where you stay? Just like Gracie Ranch, huh? We get so used to the simple luxuries in life, like plumbing and heat. Once you've been doing this, you feel like more of a man. BEN: Is that the lesson for the day? If you feel you learned something. Could be worse, Gil. Could be sleeping underneath the 405. [gunshot] Go! Move! They're gaining on us! Hurry up! Come on, Gil. I'm trying! [gunshot] Turn right! Gil! Gil, where are you? KATE: Ben? You're in the hospital. Hey, buddy. Where's Gil? I'm here, man. So what happened to you? Where did you go? I fell off my bike. My foot got caught under a rock. Oh, it did, huh? Stay calm. You're hurt. BEN: That's a good story, foot got caught under a rock. I think he planned the whole thing, that's what I think. Man, they were shooting at me, too. I mean-- I was running away. You were lagging behind. You get your foot caught under a rock, and I go off a cliff. You see what I've been telling you? Come on. I'm sorry about what he was saying. You've gotta understand, I mean, we were just at the wrong place at the wrong time. I know. I know. It's just Ben. Look, that's the key to the house. Go home. Get something to eat. Get cleaned up. I'll be home in a few hours. Are you sure? Yeah. Hey. Hey, thanks. I know you're in pain. And I really don't want you to hurt anymore. I think you're wrong about Gil. I mean, you should have seen him. He was so upset when we got here. Oh, he was, huh? You know what? I'll tell you what he's upset about. That I'm still breathing. That's the only reason. You know, when I first met you I liked dating a cop. I liked feeling safe. I liked the way you would protect me. But now I'm seeing that you're just insecure and jealous. It's not about your feelings for me. Too bad your daddy's not around Maybe you'd listen to him. So why don't you just let me bleed in peace, OK? OK. [eerie music playing] [laughter] ECHO: I love your new [inaudible].. Is this the [inaudible]? Look at this dollhouse. Oh, I do love it. [music playing] [water running] Excuse me. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. You look-- What's wrong? No, there's nothing wrong. It's just that you look different. I mean, in a good way. So, how's Ben? He's better. He should be going home tomorrow. Home as in here? No, his house. I'm sorry about what he was saying. He can be a little possessive sometimes. Yes, and angry, too. Yeah. Again, I'm sorry. You eat? Yeah. Is that OK? Sure. Look, it's been a tough day, and-- would you mind? You want-- you want me to go. I wasn't, I wasn't getting the-- I'll go upstairs and get my stuff. I'll get out of here. [buzzing] [eerie music playing] Hey, Ben. Hey. Hey, Carl. CARL: Hey, Ben. I got a sketch artist coming in today. Help you identify your redneck friends. OK. Listen, you think you could do a little investigating for me, you know, on the side? If you've got some extra time? Sure. See what you can find out about this Gil Draper character. I haven't been able to find nothing. I can't do this at home. You got it. [music playing] MUSIC: She's a mess. She's a mess. She's a mess. Crazy. Well, well. Hobo Joe turns himself into Cary Grant. I'm afraid you missed Kate. She just left for Grayson's. BEN: Yeah. Actually I came here to see you, buddy. You can use my cane if your crutch is bothering you. I'm not needing mine anymore. Oh, the pain in my leg is all right. Pain in my ass I can't seem to get rid of. Sorry to hear that. You got a pretty charming way of getting everybody to do exactly what you want them to do, but you're not fooling me. You know, all this nice guy, homeless boy stuff. I guess you can hang around and paint the fence, and run your scam on everybody. But sooner or later I'm gonna gets something on you, Jethro. And when I do, you'll be glad you kept that cane. Look at yourself. You gonna hobble me to death? With that crutch of yours? Let me tell you a few things about my relationship with Kate. Because right now she trusts me a whole lot more than she trusts you. I never hurt her like you have. Never argued with her, never teased her, insulted her. So, if I want those soft, luscious legs to spread wide open so I can ride her, like you wish your limp dick could, all I gotta do is make one romantic move her way. She'll be on her knees. Ben! Stop it! What do you doing? Tell her what you said. Come on, go ahead, fuck. Tell her. I said you deserve a better man. Ben! Get out. And as for you, you better go, too. Kate, it's him. He's the one hurting you. I don't care. I'm sick of the fighting. I want it gone now. Hear what she said? Get the hell out of here. You too, Ben. You forgot your crutch. Kate, his car was totaled. I think you should be a little bit more understanding. I'm all out of sympathy, Tonya. Fire him. He's a dishwasher, not a brain surgeon. I'm sure he'll find another job. What now? GIL (VOICEOVER): Miss Grayson, thanks for turning my life around. And forgive me for any harm I may have caused you. [music playing] Wait here. I'll be back in a minute. No. I'm coming with you. Look, I'm doing Ben a favor. We're not supposed to be here. A little help wouldn't hurt. Your choice. Let's go. Remember we were never here. [ominous music playing] CARL: Ben was right. Look at this. Oh, god. Ugh. This is definitely no coincidence. Call it in. Oh shit. [gunshots] Stay here! Oh god! Please help me. I-- No! Argh! [scream] [grunting] GIL: Brothers and I don't take kindly to trespassers. I'm very disappointed in Ben. Be nice if you came visit in person. Instead of selling us these sacrificial lambs. CARL: Aaugh! [muffled screaming] You guys clean this stuff up here. Get that car out of here. I'm gonna go take a shower. I don't want to be late for my job interview. Quick question. Um, the new guy wants an advance. What new guy? New dishwasher. KATE: A cash advance? Want to meet him? He's cute. OK, but five minutes only. OK. Thank you. The employment office sent me on some interviews. Just a few places. They just were all asking what I was doing for the last five years. And picking through garbage didn't make a great impression. Well, it fits the dishwasher prerequisites. I didn't mention your name. They just hired me on the spot. Look, if this is weird I can just take off. No. I understand. So what about the advance? I mean, I can't really hold a job living on the street. You know, I was thinking maybe I could get a hotel for a couple weeks? Save up a few paychecks? I can maybe do some work around here. I can fix almost anything. KATE: Yeah, I noticed. Thank you for that. Look, if you want to stay at the house for a few weeks-- Are you sure? TONYA: Gil? I have some things for you to sign So, sorry. If I give you a cash advance, I'm gonna have to give everyone one. I'll just have to get by then. Somehow. [piano music] KATE: See you tomorrow, guys. Night Night. Goodnight. Mozart. My father used to play that for my mom, on that piano. Really. Do you like it? Soft keys. This restaurant so much a part of my dad. I couldn't imagine changing a thing. [door opens] Hey, Kate. Can I come in? I want to talk about our relationship, if there is one. We've been together for almost a year. I'm kind of in the dark over here, you know. Are we just going to go our separate ways now? I don't know. You don't know? Does that mean you haven't decided yet? Or that you're seeing somebody else? I just don't have an answer for you. What is going on with you two? Can you tell me that? I'm not the tramp you think I am, Ben. OK. [door opens] [door closes] KATE: Gil. Gil? [laughing] That's funny? You scared me. What's all this? It's something for you. Are we celebrating something? Peace. Good. Because, I need a little of that my life right now. You've brought so much peace into my life since we've been together. I want to provide the same for you. So there's nothing between our love for each other. I know you feel the same. [ominous music] Are you crazy? What are you doing? Get the fuck away from her. The only reason that things got to this level is not because of me. It's because of him. I'm going to blow a big fucking hole in his head. My partner's missing and I bet this piece of shit had something to do with it. Now you look me right in the eyes and tell me you're not sleeping with him, or I swear to God-- I am not sleeping with him. Now give me the gun. Give me the gun. It's your lucky day. You're gonna need that. What kind of freak are you anyway? Our sex life's none of your business. How dare you! Our sex life? What is it between you two? What, are you two out to win a trophy? Am I the goddamned fucking prize? Look, Kate-- No I want you out of my house right now. Get out! Get out. [creak] [suspenseful music] [ominous music] Oh god. You sick bastard. She's here. Who? Oh, you're kidding. That's today? Here she is. Kate Grayson, Gloria Pendleton. - Good afternoon. Pleasure to meet you. Dave. Follow me. I'll have Keith bring you the lunch and dinner menus. So feel free to order off of either one. Thank you, Kate. Place looks stunning. Wouldn't you say, Gloria? It's exquisite. Enjoy your meals. [dishes breaking] Those things happen. [screaming] You get off of her! You fired me. First you kick me out of my house. Now you take away my job. I saw what you did at the ranch. So from now on, you stay away from me, the ranch, the restaurant, everything. Your pretty restaurant. Rich fucks! [gasps] Let's clean house! Gil, the police are going to be here any second. GIL: Oh, and you call the cops. That's great. You rich fucks. You feed on fear like a bunch of goddamn animals. One day you're gonna [inaudible] their cock suck and they can lie, steal, and cheat better than you. Freeze! [screaming] [gasps] OFFICER: Hold it, buddy. You started this, not me. [crash] [screaming] [suspenseful music] Hey! OFFICER: Out of the way. Police! [scream] OFFICER: Out of the way! [screams] [tires squealing] OFFICER: Police! Out of the way! Suspect's on a motorcycle, heading east towards Wallace. [sirens] KATE: Well, he told me that he was from San Jose. And that he was a contractor. He was pretty quiet. That's everything I know about him. He doesn't have copies of any house keys, does he? Not that I know of. And you say you change your security codes already? Yeah, last night. They lost him, didn't they? Look, Kate, we'll keep you informed as to what we find out. I suggest you stay at Ben's house for a change. Get a good night's rest. Ben's house. Or at a friend's house. Call if you need us. Thanks. Come on, Keith. Kate, we decided since he doesn't have a clue where I live, you're moving in with me. I'm not gonna run from this guy. It's not worth it. You saw what he did today, Kate. He's a psycho. Who's to tell what he'll do next? For all you know, he's probably waiting for you outside. What are you doing? I'm trying to scare the shit out of her, if you don't mind. That's the only way that she's gonna listen and be prepared. That fucker's lucky that I didn't have these with me in the kitchen. I carry my pepper spray and my mace. Mace is for special occasions. I'm grateful, honest. It's just if I let him control the situation, then I've lost. Then I think we should move in with you. What? I don't think you should be alone in that huge place with no one around. It's like the perfect set-up for some Stephen King movie. If that's what you guys want to do, I'd be fine with that. OK. Then we're there. They printed the story. Looks like Tait gave you break and didn't print anything about yesterday. This is all about opening. Something tells me Mrs. Pendleton won't be so kind. She had a front row seat for Gil's eloquent speech. Come on, Tonya. We've gotta get going. I'll meet you guys down there. [phone ringing] Hello? Hey, Kate. It's me. Don't hang up. You see today's paper? There's a story in here about Grayson's. Yeah. I have it right here. BEN (PHONE): Look in the photograph, over your right shoulder. In the back. It's him. [ominous music] Who's this? He was there from the get-go. Private property, boys. You'll have to turn around. [gunshot] Kate! BEN (PHONE): Hello? Kate? Ben, he's here. [gunshot] Hello? [tires squealing] BEN: I've got a 911 situation. 87 24 California. [car horn] Let's go in. Scare the girls. KATE: Ben's gun is in the kitchen. Oh! [gunshot] [car horn] [tires squealing] KATE: Fuck. [gunshots] Goddamn, woman. [laughter] What are you doing here? We need to talk. [gunshot] No. GIL: You don't recognize your old pal? Jesse. Jesse Adkins? There goes my cover. My brothers and I were supposed to give up rich kids, too. But our father got screwed over by his business partner. The money went to the great John Grayson empire. That's you. [screaming] - You got papers. You hear me? Yeah, let me see you wipe them. Wipe them tears off there. Oh yeah. Least you could do is repay me all that. OK. Get off of me! You OK? Where's Kate? She's upstairs. [gunshot] Oh! Hey, Kate, darling. How is this door gonna be any more effective than the last door? Kate! Ben! Kate! Call her in here. GIL: Call her. Go fuck yourself. GIL: Call her now! Hey, sweetheart. Don't hurt him, Gil. He's not responsible for your problems. I am. - Kate, run. Run away. You do that, and your wall's gonna be covered in your ex-boyfriends brains. What is it you want, Gil? Money? You want a written apology? I want my life back. We were headed down the right path. And you fucking blew it. Well maybe we can work something out. Oh yeah. Yeah. I've got a gun at Ben's head. We've gone way beyond forgive and forget. [clock playing] Shut it off. Shut if off! Come on. Come on! [screaming] You're coming with me, baby. Come on! Come on! [buzzing] [screaming] I was wrong about him. Use a bigger asshole than I imagined. I'm sorry, Ben. [music playing]
