I get up every night at four in the morning to take a Ieak. You aII know how smaII my bladder is. But when I got back in bed, YoIanda was awake. Which is odd, because she never wakes up at night. So I ask her, ''Honey, are you okay?'' And she says, ''I'm a nervous wreck.'' ''Well, that's normal. I'm nervous too. We're worried about the wedding.'' Then she starts crying. So l hug her and kiss her, she hugs me and kIsses me back, and then I get aroused. We had decided not to have sex the week before the wedding, lIke a game, so we'd be dying for it and fuck Iike wiId animaIs on our wedding night. The point is she needed to Iet off some steam. So l stroke her, I kiss her, I start undressing her... but then she stops me and says, ''I'm sorry, Diego, I can't.'' ''You can't what?'', I ask. ''I've been thinking about things for months.'' ''What things?'' ''Our relationship,'' she says. ''Something isn't right. No, something has neverbeen right. We've looked the other way because we Iove each other and you know I can't stand hurting you. That's why, if I'm making this decIsion, it's because my mind is made up.'' Okay. Then she goes and says, ''Diego, I can't marry you. I can't. I don't want to.'' And I didn't cry... I didn't... Because I was convinced it wouId pass, that she'd change her mind and everything wouId be fine. So I didn't pressure her. I didn't. I was reasonabIe, understanding and I even consoIed her. Because she was such a mess. She crIed and cried. You'd think l was the one who had dumped her. We agreed she'd teII her guests and I'd teII mine. As you can see, that dIdn't work out. So I'm afraid I have to ask you to Ieave the church now, because I'd Iike a few minutes to myseIf. I'm okay. Thank you aII for comIng. Let it out, cousin. Cry if you need to. You're furious. Let it out. -She might show up. -Shut up. I don't want her to come... Yes, yes, yes. Better? -He's in bad shape. -Very bad. Don't get aII psychosomatic. I know you. It's okay. We're backing up our cousin. -Okay. -Fine. I'm okay. What are you doing? Don't take those in front of me. Give me those piIIs. No piIIs. -Give me my piIIs back. -Are you nuts? Stop whining about your piIIs. -Quit screwing around. -You want your piIIs? -You want them? -Yes, thank you. Fuck your piIIs! For God's sake, stop fIghting! I'm sick of you! -Sorry. -Sorry. Those damn piIIs... Jesus! Over my dead boner. I don't mean to make things worse, but I think you rushed into it. You didn't evaIuate the risk. Know what I mean? You picked your father's birthday to get marrIed. To honor his memory. Great, very commendabIe. You know what? Good. You saved yourseIf months, even years with a bimbo who'd have dumped you anyway. lt all comes down to this: She was on the rag, man. What are you taIking about? Are you thinking with your head or your ass? -With my heart. Right here. -Pride and fury, man. Where are you goIng? -I'II get To?a. -Sit down, damn it. I think we need some female InsIght. Forget It, this is between us. To?a can bIow me. -Excuse me. -What? To?a bIows onIy me. And with pIenty of Iove. He meant figurativeIy. -The things I have to put up with. -Just in case. You see how sweet cousin Rosie Iooks since she dumped her boyfriend? I never Iiked cousin RosIe. She's too sIeazy for you. You need a girl who's Ioving, lIke my To?a. I'll go get her.

She'II be there because I say so, damn it! lf I say she's there, she's there! She's there! -You're in denial. -l won't just sit here. You're in deniaI, I'm teIIing you. -I'm not in deniaI. -Yes, you are. Is he or isn't he? If you want to get Iaid, we'II get you a hooker instead. I'm not in deniaI. This is something eIse. I'm finishing something and starting something new. -Cousin, are you with me? -I'm with you. We're taking a step forward. That's right. Let out your rage. Are you with me? Grab sack! Show your baIIs! You're too good for that bimbo. Fuck you if you don't Iove me! Fuck you if you don't Iove me! Fuck you! You'II never do any better! Never! Not even one message! I'II take you back to the viIIage and kiss you on the mouth. Thanks, cousin! To?a can drive us. She's a great driver. To?a can bIow me. And this time I mean IiteraIIy. This Is just the three of us. Nobody can know. No piIIs, no ceII phone. You wanna teII To?a? -Yes, thank you. -Go ahead. -You broke my ceII phone. -So I did. -Let's go get her. -Go get her... Go get her... Go get her... Go get her... Go get her... -It's great to see you like this. -CousIn! Let's do thIs! That's it. What is that? His puIse alarm. -Take that fucking thing off. -Don't make hIm nervous. He's making me nervous. Breathe sIowIy, cousin. Lie down and breathe sIowIy. He can't go Iike this. We aII go or nobody does. It's time for you to stop freaking out.

Mourning is important. We're not going! Look at him. Don't take three, take twenty. Go ahead and kiII yourseIf. Cousin, pIease. You can't mix those piIIs with aIcohoI. I'II pass out in five minutes. Put me in the car and take me to the viIlage. Don't say we're not going. That's baIIs for you. COUSINHOOD Excuse me. Do you know where everybody went? To the fiestas. Why dIdn't I go? Because I can't stand drunk peopIe. SInging, dancing, huggIng, kIssing... We drink strictIy to forget. When we feeI Iousy. Where were you? Wedding, baptism or communion? -A wedding. -Who got married?

You thInk it's normaI, all this troubIe you're causing? -Next tIme you make me sweat... -JuIian, stop! This is abnormaI. -Where's To?a? -To?a Isn't here. Why aren't we in Madrid? Get his piIIs.

CIose your one good eye. Now try to remember how you feIt when we were here. You were the king here. The smalIest, the fastest... The best at everything. Doesn't thinking about that make you feel better? Besides, I'm proud of you. What you did was very brave. You took an important step forward. We're good here. We're home. Your cousins wiII protect you. The Three Musketeerios? That's right, back in the saddIe. Danny, you know my cousIn was in the army? He Iost an eye in Afghanistan. A bomb went off near a schooI... -No, no... -Why no? -Don't teII the story. -No? It makes me iII. l won't teII it. He's a war hero. A fucking wacko, that's what he Is. What happened to you? I jumped in the water and humped a mermaid. Give me my piIIs. They were eaten by a depressed crab. Hey, sugar. Got any toweIs around? How about drying me off? In the bathroom.

You got her pregnant, you rascaI. What are you taIking about? Don't be ridicuIous, cousin. If I hit it, he's yours. If I hit it, he's yours. -You see? He isn't mine. -This shit is rigged. -Where's the compIaint box? -Are you lame or what? Excuse me, sir. You can't taIk to my cousin Iike that. -Who the heII are you? -I'm hIs cousIn Jose MigueI. Asshole! Come on, come on. Look at them. You Iook Iike TeIeTubbies. Oh, yeah? I'II show you my big fat TeIeTubby... Hey, watch your mouth. Did you wear a condom when you fucked her? Of course l dId.

Oh, you're a Ioony. You wanna pIay somethIng? Like what? Diseases. I'II read and the first one to get the symptoms Ioses. No, l'd better not. I'm hIghIy vuInerabIe to suggestion.

OccasIonaIIy. Apathy. What does that mean? BasicaIIy when you can't do anything, when Iife is too much for you... Oh, Iike you. Not at aII. I'm totally happy. Loss of sex drive. How are things with your girIfriend? Perfect. Extraordinary. I think she's satisfied. -GIad to hear it. -Me too. -Depression, feeIings of sadness... -Okay, okay. That's enough. You win. What have l got? Menopause. You're hiIarious. Goodbye. No, don't go yet. The IittIe brat wants me to stay? Why is that? Because you're in even worse shape than I am. 1-0. Let's do another.

In Lanzarote for my cousin's wedding. It is the wedding season... lt sure is. But you didn't go because you couId sense I was coming. Yeah, I've spent the Iast ten years waiting at the station lIke PeneIope and takIng vaIium. I didn't go because Danny's afraId of fIying. He can't stand being suspended in the air. You with a son. lt's weird. Good weird. It reaIIy fits you. How oId Is he? How oId wouId you say? Eight, nine... NIne. Yeah, between eight and nine. CIoser to eight or cIoser to nine?

I kept saying, ''If l hIt it, she'II come back to me.'' l think you're who I meant. YoIanda vanished and you appeared. -Did you hit it? -Yes, weII, no. But that's because the rifIes are rigged. How about this: l'II make some gazpacho, I'm the gazpacho king. Then we'II have a picnic on the beach, a IittIe dancing... You Iike dancing, right? Then after that... we'II make another kid aII night long. At Ieast I make you Iaugh. I'm funny, right? Yeah, you're a scream. Did you know Iaughter is the door to Iove? Besides, I saw the stones.

But they say his baIIs were Iike... this big. Have you seen a therapist? I go three times a week. My girIfriend is the best therapIst. She took care of me when I was in the hospital. A nurse isn't a therapist. You shouId find a pro. No, no. Doctors give you tests and more tests. It was my To?a who got me out of the hospital and now I'm fIne. So you're supposedIy fine now? -What are you, a wise guy? -At Ieast I got you to open your eye. I'II cIose it If I want to. -No, you won't. -Watch me. If you do, you'II miss my mom in topIess.

You don't beIieve in taking things sIowIy, do you? lmagIne I'm going to die in two days and I ask you to spend them with me, both going aII out. WouId you do it? Of course l would. Great. Let's do that then. Diego, I'm going in the water. Coming? I can't get up right now. I was fantasizing... about death... It was bound to happen sooner or Iater. Shit happens. I'd rather you said you got a hard on Iooking at my tits. WeII, that too. I may be romantic, but I'm also very sexuaI. Damn. Looking that way Is no heIp. Hookers? Damn, you shouId have said so. AII the mystery... What's wrong, feelIng the itch? TeII me about It. But let me teII you something about hookers. I've got nothIng against them, but... These pIaces make me feeI uncomfortabIe.

WeII, for the three of us. I mentioned I had a son. I toId her I caIIed the wrong number and said I was sorry. What? I prelove you. I can't say I Iove you because it's too soon and you'II get spooked. More than you already are, I mean. So I preIove you. I prelove you very much. You're immature way beyond your age. -Hitting it off, are we? -Yeah, right. Yesterday one woman had me down, today two. I'm not cut out for Iove. Motherfucker! -You drunk asshoIe! -Watch your mouth!

When did everything turn to shit? I used to look at you... with your video store, a wife who Ioved you, a beautifuI daughter, an awesome fishing boat... I even remember the first movie I rented from you. ''ThesIs.'' I said, ''Forget it, Spanish movies are Iame.'' And you sIapped me and saId, ''This guy Amen?bar is a genius. He's going to be great.'' He made his first movie when he was 23. When I was 23, I opened the store, got married -and had a baby. -You were the Amen?bar of ComiIlas. You were my idoI. I wanted to be just Iike you.

I'm your fish, Sardine. Catch me! Bastard! Last year we were on the p?rate ride and suddenly he started say?ng, ''Mom, l can't breathe.'' He wanted to get off but it was too dangerous. He cried and screamed that he was dying. l got them to stop the r?de, we rushed to the clinic... He vomited before he got there, that calmed h?m down a bit. Was it his first tIme on the ride? He'd been on it eight times the day before. -And did something different happen? -I guess. The other tImes it wasn't with me. He rode with somebody eIse. Somebody eIse? Some guy off the street? Somebody I invited to spend the weekend with us. You mean somebody eIse, somebody eIse? Somebody eIse, somebody eIse. And Danny didn't get aIong with that somebody eIse? No, Danny got aIong great wIth him. Maybe too weIl. Because after he Ieft he asked me, ''Mom, is he my dad?'' And I said, ''No, son. He's not your dad.'' It was the fIrst time he ever asked me about him. Where is that somebody eIse now? I imagine with somebody eIse. So Danny had an anxiety attack because somebody eIse wasn't coming back and he'd have to take care of his bitter, soIitary and not mincing words beautifuI mother for the rest of her Iife. Yeah, it sounds Iike ''Psycho.'' Hey, one thIng. Has Danny asked you if I'm his dad? No, he asked me if Miguel was. That's IogicaI. Here, it gets chiIIy at night. Good night. Good night. I'm never coId at night. Shut up. Hi. Remember me? Sure. Best sex I ever had. Huge boner. No, damn it. I used to come every summer. But it's been years. You were madIy in Iove with me. You wanted to be my girIfriend. You foIIowed me everywhere I went. You were a paIn in the ass. But I was 9 years oIder than you. To me you were just a kid. JuIian, JuIianuco. Your father used to caII me Sardine. That's right, Sardine! Wow, Iong time no see! Damn, you Iook pretty ugIy with that moustache. What brings you here? Well, l was in town for a few days. I was having coffee wIth your dad earIier and I asked about you. So you work here. -What do you want? -What do you think? Right. It's too bad, I don't do guys I know. l'm in sales. I seII heavy machinery. I started as the youngest saIesman and in a few months I was number one in saIes. -The fucking master. -ReaIIy? I'm bragging because it's true, the numbers are there. I convince farmers screwed by EU restrictions to change tractors. Wow. Even a tractor and a harvestor without breaking a sweat. Stop, you're getting me aII wet. Yeah? You want to go upstairs? Your teenage dream wiII come true and you'll even make a buck. You wIsh... Very good, Clara. Your dad wiII be glad to hear it, he thinks you're a hooker. Look, Sardine. Nobody taIks about my father. I'd rather taIk about you. Wouldn't you rather just fuck? I'm not a IittIe pest anymore. Does fucking cost the same as taIking? TaIking costs more. A Iot more. Danny? lt's me. Sorry to wake you up. Is something wrong? This used to be my parents' bedroom. When I was IittIe l'd come in here whenever I got scared. My father aIways toId me to think of Tarzan. Are you scared? Let's just say I see ghosts at night. Then think of Tarzan. l aIready did. The thing is, Tarzan without Jane... I say, ''Diego, focus. Tarzan.'' But no. Jane. AIways Jane. Can we spoon for a IittIe whIIe? Spoon? You know, I Iie behind you with my arms around you. I know what it means. But you said you onIy wanted to sleep next to me. Yeah, but l can't faII asIeep unIess I'm hoIding someone. l want to sIeep wIth you in my arms. Okay, fine. HoId me. Sorry. -Just hoId me. -Sorry about that. Your hair smeIIs so good. It smeIIs Iike the mountains. Like the sea, Iike tomatoes. I couId get high just smeIlIng you. Very romantic, Diego. Do you have a hard on again? No... WeII, sort of. Totally. With YoIanda... l onIy mention her to catch you up to date... We decided not to have sex the week before the wedding. So aII that time without... Throw in a IittIe spooning, the way you smeII and there you go. At least I have something to do with your erection. Let's fuck. Sorry, It sIipped out. Okay, yeah. Let's fuck. We both want to... You want to? Of course l do. We're acting Iike teenagers. It makes no sense... Do you lIke to be on top or underneath? You're spoiIing the mood. Sorry, I just want you to enjoy our second tIme. It couIdn't be any worse than the first. You dIdn't Iike the fIrst time? I sure did. I thInk I Iasted Iong enough... I remember it fondIy... Stop! You want me to decide? Fine. I get to be on top. Can we go twice in a row? The first wIll be brief. lf you think you're ready to go you're dreaming. I'm not doing anything untiI you wash yourself down there. You're not very good at thIs, CIara. You're not a hooker. I have pIenty of experience in the sector. You don't work here as a prostitute. You're probabIy serving drinks, taIking to customers to get them horny. You just want your dad to think you're a prostitute to make him suffer. Look, Sardine. I'm in a room with a guy sitting on a bidet who's paying me. What does that sound Iike? Any preference? You Iook Iike a soccer wife. I meet a Iot of pIayers because of my job. I'm buddies with GutI. CIients think it's cooI I know a Iot of ReaI Madrid pIayers. You are such a turn on! Let's fuck. Don't get me wrong. Look, I have a probIem I thInk I'd better share with you. Small weenie? No, normaI Iength. Seven and a haIf inches. It doesn't work right... It works perfectIy, thank you. But as you're probabIy aware, most men after they have sex feeI immediateIy detached from the woman. They want to disappear. In my case, it's exactIy the opposite. I feeI a speciaI connection. You're sweet under that tough guy exterior... CarefuI... I can't. I see your dad's face. Right there, on the waII. Goddamn it... WiII you see him if I show you my boobs? CIarIta... We're Iike famiIy. I was at your communion. We're Iike cousins. Distant, very distant... I bet you don't see my dad now, do you? No. WiII you teII him about this after we're done? I can keep a secret. That spoiIs the fun. If you need to, you can Iook at me and jerk off if you want. No. Got Guti's phone number handy? Yeah, but it's confidentiaI. Look, he's jeaIous! It wasn't that bad, was it? Sorry. I thought you were asIeep. It was great. I gave an incredibIe performance. So did you, by the way. But I don't know what came over me. lt wasn't the sex, it was because... It was bound to happen sooner or Iater. It's a matter of IogIc. l'm sorry. Don't be. I'm gIad I heIped you through it. Think of Tarzan... and Cheetah the monkey. Cheetah the monkey. Okay. That helps. WiII you be my girIfriend? I thought you onIy faIl in love after having sex. You need to get your story straIght. I have 13 minutes Ieft. You and me. Give me 13 minutes to prove to you I can make you happy. You want me to be your girIfriend for 13 minutes? I've had shorter reIationships. And that wedding ring? I'm very jeaIous, I'm warning you... This is just so cIients wiII thInk I'm married. It seaIs the deaI. It's been proven. Guti and the wedding ring. The perfect combo. -13 minutes? -13 minutes. DarIing, I'm so gIad you're home. I missed you so much... Did you? Don't worry, I'm here. How was your day, my Iove? NormaI, just here aII day, sucking dicks. How about you? Great. I soId four steamroIIers for the new highway they're buiIding from my heart to yours. Four steamrollers. How romantIc! Not Iike that. Treat me more macho. Sorry. Four steamrollers. What a stud... We've aIready wasted a minute. This reIationship is consummated by the minute. I was thinking maybe we couId ceIebrate our one-minute anniversary. Sure. With a bIowjob, right? I don't know. If you're up for it... You said you wanted Iove... A bIowjob can be done with a Iot of Iove. That's true, you're absoIuteIy right. Besides, you need to reIax. You're meetIng with the oiI industry tomorrow. My boss is driving me nuts. You bItch! Damn. Like I said, Sardine. Like I said. ThIs Is unbeIievabIe. Yesterday we were a mess, and now Iook at us. ReIaxed, enjoying ourseIves. Drunk at ten In the morning, but relaxed. What do you mean? I got up at 7 A.M. and went hiking. How was Iast night? -Did you get anywhere? -We're making progress. What's wrong? She won't bone you? Don't be gross. Don't taIk Iike that. Okay, Iet's change the subject. DId you get some? l'm happy, smiIing on the insIde. I have my moments, but... What are you whispering? No secrets... My sources telI me... Last night you dipped your donut. -What are you taIking about? -Yes, sir. You know what a Iight sIeeper I am. l'm happy for you. Were you up to the task? Did you give her muItipIe orgasms? I make Iove at night and give women flowers in the morning. I'm discreet. Sorry. I wouIdn't say discreet... -WouId you keep your mouth shut? -Listen. I'm so sick of this song... To?a, To?a, To?a... To?a, To?a, To?a... Sweetheart! My Iove! How couId you Ieave without me? They drugged me! They drugged me and kidnapped me! What have you done to my baby? Where the heII dId she come from? l'm okay, sweetie. I'm okay. You want some plumcake? No, you're my pIumcake. Yodi... No. Why do you bring me to the beach? l don't Iike it. -You need fresh air. -I'II get a meIanoma. -l covered you in sun bIock. -l don't trust it. Why aren't you topIess? I don't feeI lIke it. So Diego's girIfriend won't see you? How siIIy! I like redheads. -Whose side are you on? -Yours. That's what I thought... Here, give me a kiss. It's just the two of us again. lt Iooks Iike it. -Good. -Great. -Go for a swim? -No. Okay. How dId you know I was here? MartIna caIIed me. When did Martina caII you? Late Iast night. Before or after? Before or after what? I don't know. Before or after 3 A.M., for exampIe? After. To tell you how great I am and how crazy you are for dumping me? I aIready knew that. That's not fair, don't say that. Why are you here? Do you regret what you did? Seeing another woman made you jeaIous? By another woman, I don't mean another woman... I don't know. Something made you drive 6 hours. You even brought the dog. You know it makes me cry. -I missed my period. -What? It couId be the stress, or I'm sad... I shouId have had It 5 days ago. Did you take a pregnancy test? I wanted to take it with you. Then what do we do? Get married again and start over? That wouId be great, but... What if you're not? ''Sorry, faIse aIarm. So Iong.'' -Don't say that. -You're driving me nuts. I wanted to be with you. I didn't want to keep it from you. I didn't mean to bother you, -but I'II Ieave if you want me to. -You don't bother me. That's the thing. Can I have a hug? No, you hug me. You're the one who dumped me. MigueI, what's wrong, baby? It's okay, my Iove. It's okay. Cousin! Did you take your benzo? No, they took my piIIs away. What do you mean? Have you got shit for brains? Taking away his medication? You'II give him backIash! -The backIash is kicking in... -To?a, he's fine. Are you a nurse, by any chance? Here, sweetheart. More water! In my Iine of work, to be number one, you have to give the cIient something extra. How otherwise? Buy them dinner and drinks at the VIP Iounge at the Pacha... And hookers. That's essentiaI. Look. Her name was HeIena, with an H. What a gIrI. Russian, 22 years oId, bIonde, beautifuI, super taII... -Good in bed? -Damn straight. We went upstaIrs, she went down on me in the bathroom and I was hooked. -She sucked you off? -Did she ever. I knew she was onIy after a green card. Like aII of them. But l thought she wanted something more. That she was into me. But two months Iater, she took off. -HeIena with an H. -HeIena. Know what the probIem is? -HeIena with an H. -No, she's not. I'm the probIem. As soon as l have sex... I stick It in and I faII in love. Hookers, even more. Because it's the onIy thing that feeIs Iike the reaI deaI. Like Richard Gere. In ''Pretty Woman.'' Richard Gere, JuIia Roberts. DIrected by Garry MarshaII in 1990. ExactIy. Hey, the year CIara was born. You shouIdn't have Iet me rent that movie. You saw my daughter. What? You saw my daughter. I'm teIIing you about Helena with an H. -When? -I didn't see her. -When? -I didn't see her. -When? -I didn't see her! -When? -Last nIght. But I did it for you. I'm worried about you. l want you two to patch things up. You fucked her. No, l dIdn't. You fucked her. No, l dIdn't. Now Iisten to me. -You fucked her. -No. And she's not a hooker. She's onIy a waitress. -You fucked her. -No, l dIdn't! -Yes, you did! -No, I didn't! Okay, I tried. But she wouIdn't Iet me. I tried to fuck her, for your sake. You shouId thank me. Do whatever you want. What about it? I thought you were Iike a son. Don't take it so hard. Bachi, no... Bachi! Not the water! Don't jump in the water again! I'd rather you slugged me! I won't jump in after you! Go ahead and drown! -Why dId you call her? -To heIp you get her back. l don't want her back. I want to be with you. -You were getting married. -Yeah, but that was before. That was yesterday! What? There's somebody eIse. -What do you mean? -She met somebody eIse. -Somebody eIse? -Yeah, somebody eIse. She spent two months in India with Dentists Without Borders. She's a very sociaIIy-conscious oraI surgeon. And somewhere among aII those cavities she met somebody eIse. -An oraI surgeon. -An oraI surgeon. She says nothing happened, but It scared her. That when she's In Iove, aII other men are invIsibIe. But this jerk showed up and she started having doubts. -Why didn't you teII me this before? -Because it's humiIiating. No Iess than buyIng a pregnancy test to find out who the father is... You saId nothing happened. And you belIeve her? She fucked him in India. I don't care. I swear I don't care if she did. But you fuck him and move on. Don't teII me about it. You were engaged, damn it. That oral surgeon can't give you what I can. Fucking coward. -Just Iike you. -Me? You caIIed her because you were scared. -Scared of what? -Of things working out between us. Maybe you're the one scared of things working out. You've done nothing but screw things up since you got here. You were probabIy doing the same thing with your girIfriend. Or ex-girIfriend. You got scared. Just Iike with that ''somebody eIse.'' I can teII. You're IeavIng. You'II Ieave wIth her by sundown. Something between you Is unfinished. -Did you teII her we had sex? -No, I didn't. I have better taste than that. You'II end up teIIing her anyway. -No, I won't. -Yes, you wiII. Because you want revenge, but you aIso want her back. And teIIing her you sIept wIth me wiII heIp you get both. The pharmacy. Cousin? What's the problem? Why are you soaking wet? Cousin, are you okay? -Sweetie, your piII. -I'd better check on my cousin. Fuck him. Eat it. I'm a IittIe embarrassed. Honey, I'd better take it now... Stud! Very good. -Give me a kiss. -Sorry. GIve me a kiss. Damn, what now? lt's my day off. Why are you soaking wet? Your dad jumped in the sea and drowned. I trIed to save him... He swaIIowed too much water and his heart stopped. They managed to revive him, but he's in bad shape. -Take me to hIm. -See? Look how upset you are. You do care about him. That's why you didn't move away. You son of a bitch! Okay, okay... Give me a second. CaIm down, damn it! NothIng happened. But someday it wiII. And you're both acting Iike idiots. -I went too far, I'm sorry. -What? I went too far. I do stupid things sometimes. I'm not perfect. Sardine, just go. I taIked to your dad. He's In bad shape. Come with us to the wharf Iater for the cuca?a. Remember when we were kIds? You used to Iaugh when I'd faII. l'II pass. You're a coupIe of drunks. And just so you know, I wouIdn't have fucked you for a millIon euros. Of course not. Because you only have sex when you're in Iove, Iike me. Get Iost, you jerk! You'II be there, you know you wiII. Because you dig the cuca?a. And you dig me too. I'm your RIchard Gere. Goddamn Iunatic! ''Symptoms that do not match cIassic disease symptoms or are inconsIstent.'' Interesting. ''MuItipIe prIor hospital stays.'' LIttIe creep. Trying to scare me, huh? Look. Steady as a rock. ''The parent is excessiveIy attentIve and serviIe in a hospitaI setting and frequentIy works in a fieId reIated to medicine, Iike nursing.'' It's caIIed Munchausen's Syndrome, by proxy. ''By proxy.'' What a snob. ''A psychiatric disorder in whIch the aduIt provokes or simuIates symptoms in a chiId in their care, frequentIy their own chIldren. The mother intentionaIIy makes the chiId sick so the chiId wiIl need her.'' Damn. PeopIe are screwed up. The fIrst time I read it, I didn't Iet my mom near me for a week. And I wouIdn't eat anything unIess I saw it prepared, just in case. You're reaIIy something. Bad choice of disease. You're right, it's more for young women... Sweetie! Come on, I set up mattresses in the garden for our breathing exercises! I'm breathing just fIne, Iook. Sweetie, come on. Coming. I'd better go. We'II keep pIaying Iater. I'm winning 1-0. Champions... -How Iong does it say to wait? -Three minutes. Pretty fast, huh? Find out if your Iife wiII change in 3 minutes. These things shouId take at least 3 days so you can get your head around it. Can you make the sound for me? -Did you sIeep with her? -What? -Diego... -No, no, no. No, no, no. Yes. I did sIeep with her. But you have no right to be mad or jeaIous. Don't cry, you know seeing you cry makes me cry as weII. -Are you in Iove with her? -No. There wasn't time. It's impossibIe. But you onIy sleep with someone if you're in Iove. That's true, but what can I do? You dumped me, I'm down and out... Every morning I wake up and I want to get back together. What? I'm a bitch. I have no right. I'm driving you crazy. I'm sorry. I've aIways Iiked you driving me crazy. Then what shouId we do? Hope you're pregnant. And make that our biggest priority. Nothing. Negative. Stress has aIways affected your hormones. I had my hopes up. What about the oral surgeon? The oraI surgeon is the oraI surgeon. Just an escape. And now that you've escaped? He's gone. For good. What about Martina? Is she just an escape or something more? What if I said Iet's forget everything and pIck up where we left off? I know you won't forget the paIn l caused you. No, I won't. Not the water! Not the water! A dog! A dog! You're in rare form here. I thought you were missing me. You Iooked so Ioose out there, with your cousins... Diving in without earpIugs... I don't know. You stiII haven't expIained why you didn't caII me. I don't get it. I don't know what came over you. -My cousins wouIdn't Iet me. -Your cousins? Those are cousins? Those aren't cousins. Just because they're famiIy doesn't mean they want what's best for you. Don't be angry. I'm angry because you're not angry. You're the one who shouId be angry. Getting angry wIII make me sick. Sure, you'II get sIck. You're right, I'm sorry. Sorry isn't good enough. How wiII you ever stand up for anything if you can't stand up for me to your cousins? Jeepers, MigueI. They're reaIIy hurting us. No more hurting. SweetIe... Your puIse is racing. Did you have a bad thought? My baby had a bad thought! What was it? It must be broken. Honey, it's off the charts... I'II give you somethIng... That's what you get for doIng the cuca?a. Acting aII brave in front of your cousins... You never Iisten to me. It stopped. You broke it. Sweetie, you broke it. That's vIoIence! Listen, Clarita. Just reIax. From now on, I'm gonna take care of your dad. I'II see to It he's weII-Iooked after. You're gonna buy him a wInery? Are you trying to make this harder on me? Go right ahead. I'm so pumped up today I couId seII a fIeet of freight eIevators. Getting your cIients Iaid. Everybody gains. That reminds me, I'm Iate. I have to be going. It's your day off. At least I take a day off. You're drunk 24-7. We agreed on a cease fire. Put that away, you're not even the one who reached it. You see how aIike you are? Two hydrauIic sIedgehammers. You both Iove smashing things. I'II continue, if you don't mind. I've given this situation a Iot of thought. So far, I've managed to get you two face to face for a cup of coffee... straight... And I think I have the answer to your probIem. lt's me. l'm wiIIing to be the Iink between you. I'm wiIIing to make that sacrifice. Like a middIe to Iong term intermediary. A middIe to long term Intermediary? What's that supposed to mean? Are you proposIng? First he'II have to dIvorce Helena with an H. HeIena with an H? Great, Sardine. Great. You Iied to me. He said the ring was a prop. I'm glad nothing happened because I wouId have feIt awfuI. Nothing happened? No, It was more Iike ''An OffIcer and a GentIeman.'' Richard Gere, Debra Winger. Directed by TayIor Hackford. 1982. I think ''Rain Man'' had more of an effect on him. Tom Cruise, DustIn Hoffman, directed by Barry Levinson in... -'88. -'87. -'88. -I remember perfectIy. That's enough! If you two want to gang up on me, that's fine with me. It's cIearIy a step forward. But you know what? I can seII anything. Anything. I want you two to reconciIe and I snap my fingers. It's a matter of time and strategy. But who buys me? Can you teII me that? l have a great job. Good saIary, bonuses, pats on the back, company car, VIP box seats at the game, it's aII great. But I get home at night and I sit on the couch with the TV off in my pyjamas Iike an idiot... and I see my refIection and think, ''What's the point?'' What's the point? So you can go back to your IittIe probIems now. Sorry, you're right. It was in '87. No, it was in '88. I was onIy trying to piss you off. But if you say '87, it's '87. No, a fact is a fact. It was '88, period. That's what I said, '88. Correct. You know what you did wrong? You set the bar too high, Dad. And I've been searching for the same thing ever sInce. And I think l've even fabricated it. I forced myseIf to feeI the way you did. And it's a IIe. lt's a Iie. I don't know if I've ever reaIIy Ioved a woman. I ask myself that question and I have no idea. I'm so IoneIy, Dad. I don't IIke being aIone. I don't know why, but I can't stand it. There, I said It. I just want to Iove somebody, I don't care who it is. I'II take either one of them. And that isn't right. I'm supposed to Iike one more than the other. When one strokes me, I'm happy. When the other one strokes me, I'm just as happy. I'm a fraud. It's aII a Iie. What a putz. Look what a mess I made. You were abIe to Iove a woman, from start to finish. With aII your heart. How the heII do you do that? I thought I couId and I haven't got a cIue anymore. Son, ask your cousin JuIian, he knows. Hi, cousin. What a dope. How Iong have you been there? I don't know, but when you said you were loneIy he got aII wishy-washy. -You reaIIy got to him. -Look. What is it? I can't see it from here. A bug. It's a piII bug. It curIs up into a baII when you touch it. That's what piII bugs do. To?a is my finger... and I'm the piII bug. To?a touches me, I curI up into a baII. Are you guys coming out of the cIoset tonight or what? What shouId we do? We need to do something different. I'm in a Ioop. Let's get sIoshed. He said something different. You kiIIed me. You're the one kiIIing me. That's euthanasia. Things were so easy before. You'd go onstage, sing a song for the girI you Iiked and you were happy aII summer Iong. And girIs used to chase after us Iike we were the Pet Shop Boys. No, the Backstreet CousIns. You said it. You wouIdn't. -If I take a coupIe downers... -A coupIe more. -A coupIe of whiskies... -A coupIe more. Remember the...? Some neurons not even aIcohoI can kiII. Or anti-depressants erase. I dedicate thIs song to Bachi, the Amen?bar of ComiIIas and the prettIest girI in aII Santander. For you, beautifuI. This is dedicated to someone very speciaI. Danny. And To?a. I Iove you. I want to dedicate this song to... to... to... to... ...to the Iove of my Iife. Let's go, ComiIIas! Let's go, ComiIIas! That's enough. Thank you very much. Hey, have you seen Sardine? I wanted to congratuIate him and he's gone. He's probabIy signing autographs. What a threesome. -How are you? -Fine, and you? Great. -You Iook awesome. -Very correct. And you? Correct. We're aII correct. l see you everyday. You don't reaIize, but I see you outside the cIub. Know what the worst part is? lt makes me feeI safer. WeII, if you need me there, I'II be there for sure. It's my job. I do it too. Every night I waIk by your boat on my way home to see if you're okay. To make sure you haven't cracked your head open. To make sure you're there, sleeping it off. You don't know how ashamed I am to hear that. Dad, I need you to quit drinking. If you want us to start over, you have to quit drinkIng. I'II aIways take care of you. I'II never Iet anything happen to you. Drunk or sober. You're my princess. Drunk or sober isn't good enough. It's no picnic for me either, seeing you go in that pIace every day. Let's meet tomorrow for coffee and you can check -the job offers. -First quIt drinking. Then we'II see. Dad, it was empty. I didn't reaIize. -Have we got a deaI? -I make the ruIes here. Correct. Correct. Am I interrupting? No. I'm Ieaving. Let me know if you need anything. SardIne's Ieaving. Oh, weII. What can we do? -So Iong. -It was bound to happen sooner or Iater. -See you in ten years. -Or twenty. There's no hurry. What have I done to deserve thIs? Carmen Maura and Chus Lampreave. Directed by Pedro AImod?var in 1984. Sardine, come here, damn it. Where are you going, John Wayne? You're gonna faII off your horse. I'm scared. Me too. But we'II overcome it together. You know how I Iost my eye? A bomb went off in a schooI and it caught fire. I saved 21 chiIdren. I carrIed them out -one by one. -I don't beIieve you. Listen, Danny. I have a special nose for kids. If l see one in danger, I swItch off. We're getting on that rIde and nothIng wiII happen. We'II buy up aII the tIckets so nobody wiII bother us. When we get off that ride, we'll have huge baIIs Iike Spartacus. -From riding the pirate ship? -That's right. You're with cousin Jose MigueI. -What are you doing? -Waiting. What are we waiting for? The finaI battIe. Who against? Them? No, against ourseIves. It's gonna be a cIose one. He was lying wounded on the highway. He'd been run over by a car. Diego and I both tried to heIp him. We didn't know each other. We took him to the emergency vet. Right when he touched me, I feIt Iike I was home. I knew just by the smeII of his sweater that he wouId change my Iife. We adopted the dog, moved in together two weeks Iater and after one month he wanted to get married. WeII, so did I. We each got a ring tattooed. Very pretty. When I Ieft for India, saying goodbye at the airport, l couIdn't imagine being apart for a minute. I was dying. And what happened in India? I reaIized I was fine without Diego, that we missed each other in different ways. I can't give him what he deserves, I won't be good enough. You don't have to be good enough or Iove him and miss him the same way. It's great you can Iive without him, that you're not dependent on him, and there's nothing wrong with noticIng other men. It's scary, because It makes you question a Iot of things. But it's okay if you stiIl feeI Iike he's your souI mate whenever you smeII his sweater. I Iike you. I Iike you too. What a bummer. l was hoping I'd hate you. Danny, open your eyes. Just a Iittle bit. Otherwise you'II get dizzy. Great, you see? We're fine... lt's just the two of us... SIowIy... SIowly, please, slowly. Look, there's your mom. Wave heIIo. I don't want to Iet go. You do it. I don't want to Iet go either. Honey, what are you doing up there? You'II get dizzy. No, sweetie, l'm okay! Stop the ride. He's very iII. We're fine! I'm not iII, okay? Don't worry! I'm gonna Iet go. I'm gonna Iet go. I'm gonna Iet go. Danny, Iet go. It's cooI, you'II see. Don't be acting aII brave now! Let's go, on three! One... Two... Three! Very good, Danny. Look, Mom, no hands! BaIIs Iike Spartacus! Hey, cousIns! Cousins! Thanks for bringing me here! l Iove you guys! The Three Musketeerios! The fireworks, baby! -Cover your ears! -I don't want to! You know you have to dump her, right? Yeah, l know. To?a! It's over! You've turned me into a chIckenshit! You've screwed up my Iife! I'm not a piII bug! What are you taIking about? I'm not a IittIe boy! I'm not your IittIe baby! I'm a man! -A man! -Are you stupid or what? It's over! I'm Ieaving you! What the heII are you taIking about? -I didn't mean right now! -Sorry. The moment got the best of me. Stop the rIde! Don't stop it! Don't stop it! We want to stay up here forever! That bump isn't good! That bump isn't good! Higher, make it go higher! HIgher, higher! To?a's having an anxiety attack. We gave her my cousIn's piIIs, but she isn't reacting. She reaIIy freaked out. YoIanda wants to take her back to Madrid. And you're Ieaving too. I don't want her driving aIone at night. Of course. Now is where you say, ''l toId you you'd Ieave with her before sundown.'' I won't... Everything I said I feIt these Iast few days, I reaIIy feIt. l know. I don't doubt that. What about you? Did you not feeI everythIng you said you didn't feel? Let me see one thing. You need to Iearn to be on your own. Stop thrusting aII your needs and dependencIes on the first girI who comes aIong. YoIanda isn't the first girl who came aIong. l'm not taIking about YoIanda. Martina... DIego, it's okay. Don't try to justify yourseIf. Don't feeI bad. Why do I feel Iike I didn't make a decision? Because you dIdn't. Or because you had aIready made up your mind. I'm a dIsaster. lt's part of your charm. SUMMER 2010 I didn't feeI any of the things I said I didn't feeI. You didn't give me time to. I prelove you. Very much. With your mouth. Bitch. -Can I see your eye? -No, no. Is it hollow? I have a gIass eye, but it doesn't work. The patch is fake. He started wearIng it after ''PIrates of the Caribbean.'' Right, BachI? Give me that. Correct? Correct. -WIlI you be checking every day? -You got a probIem? Incorrect. No, Danny... Danny, that's enough. l'm going to eat this sIice of pIumcake. Is it the fIrst one I notIced? Yes. But I considered others first, and it's cIearIy the one I IIke best. That's why I'm going to eat it. Because I'm hungry. Hungry for many things. But I'm going to eat It sIowIy. What matters is the decision is mine and mine aIone. The first decision I've made in severaI days. The first, but not the last. Breakfast isn't as easy as you think. Are you comparing me to a pIumcake? It's the first thing I grabbed. Cousin, not my eye! It's okay. Don't, it freaks me out. I don't want to show my eye. It freaks me out! Let's pIay ping pong wIth your eye! Not ping pong! It's okay, caIm down. No, I don't want to pIay. Danny wiII take care of It. He's a responsibIe kid. -How old are you? -Nine. And don't caII me kid. So you were conceived ten years ago. An interesting fact. Did you hear that, cousin Diego? No, pIease! I'm freaking out, I'm freaking out. Take me to the hospitaI... Not that eye, that's my good one!
