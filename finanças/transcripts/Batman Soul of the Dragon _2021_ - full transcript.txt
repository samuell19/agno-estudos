Another, sir? Keep them coming. Oh, crap. And you are? Dragon. Richard Dragon. He is... preoccupied. He'll want to hear this. Come. I'm sorry to interrupt... No, no, Schlangenfaust. We're quite finished here. What is it? One of our facilities in France was... compromised. And? Someone knows we have The Gate. Then you know what to do. I'm afraid our time has come to an end. Honey, in my line of work, it always does. But, you know, if you need any more help, I'm only a phone call away. Indeed. What the hell, man? Hey! Hey! Dance for me. Real funny, wise guy. Now, open the door. You aren't the only customer I have tonight. Dance... for me. I'm not dancing for you. You dig? Now open the damn door! You hear me, freak? What the... Oh, please! God! No, no! This isn't funny! Open the door! Open the door! Oh, God! Please, no! Please! This is my favorite part. No, please! Hey. Slow down, Charlie Chan. There's a line. I'm not here for the music. I'm a friend of the owner. Buddy, I know karate. So, how about you get out of here, before I kick your ass? Karate? That stuff only works in the movies. Oh, I assure you, it's very real. Why don't you show me? I'll even let you have the first shot. Don't say I didn't warn you. Not here. In there. You're about to enter a world of hurt. I'm going to enjoy this, you little-- Hey! What are you doing? Come back here! Somebody get the key! Hey! Hey! Come on, man! I'm sorry, Bruce. But it's just not enough. Look... I love you. And, I know you love me. What we have together is rare. Special. But after all these months, there's still a part of you that I just can't reach. I know it sounds ridiculous, but it's like there's some... dark secret. Something you're hiding from me. Whatever it is, just tell me. We'll face it together. Silver, honey, it's not like that. There's nothing... Just... tell me. I can't. - Silver... - Don't call me. Ever. Excuse me. Bad time? Richard? Sorry about barging in. I can come back. No. No. Please. It's good to see you. Can I make you a drink? Sure. Nice pad. How long has it been? I can't think of the last time we saw each other. Really? I bet you can remember the last time. The first time, too. Yeah. Hello? Anybody? I've come a long... way. Screw you, then. Welcome. We've been expecting you. No one answered when I knocked. The door to destiny is always open... if you are brave enough to walk through it. Now shut the door before you let the heat out. Welcome to Nanda Parbat. To find this place took great skill and courage. You'll need both. Yes, O-Sensei. I'm eager to learn. They all say that... at the beginning. - They? - Yes. You'll be the sixth. Shiva. My best student. Disciplined. Honorable. You can expect a speech from her at graduation. That is Ben Turner. Strong and fierce. He came here, seeking a way to control his temper. We're still working on that. That one is Jade. A good student, but she is always asking questions. Makes my head hurt. And then, Rip. A decorated war hero, now looking for peace. He's very dedicated. Also, he makes an excellent bowl of chili. You said six. Oh, yes. Yes. He's been here so long, I sometimes forget he's here. That is Richard. Richard Dragon. Each are unique in their own way, as you will be. Now, I have shown you the grounds. Where does that lead? - What? - That. The door. It's set apart from the rest of the buildings. You didn't mention it. Didn't I? Richard! Show our new recruit to his quarters. Bruce. This road is not an easy one. It often leads to ruin for those unfit to walk it. You can still leave. No, Sensei. I can't. So, what brings you to Gotham? Always to the point. You haven't changed at all, Bruce. You might be surprised. Someone has The Gate. So, you came here? What am I gonna do? Help me find it. Me? No, no. In between the club downstairs, charity functions, my father's business-- Trouble with your lady. Right. My calendar is pretty full. Now if you need some money, I'm happy to write a check, but the other stuff, those days are over. That's too bad. You and I both know the skills we've acquired don't fade that easily. Besides, aren't you some sort of globe-trotting super spy now? Why the hell do you need me? My employers would try to open it. Use it to their benefit. I can't do this alone. I need someone I can trust. Someone to see it through to the end. And you, Bruce, are just about the most driven man I've ever known. Sorry, Richard. I have my own scene going on. Yes. I can see that. I need to keep an eye on the patrons. Afraid they're gonna rip off your napkins? The truck will be there at midnight. What about the cops? With what we're paying them, they'll help load the drugs! Whatever this is, it's not as important as The Gate. We owe him. All right. Let's hear it. Terrorist group got their hands on The Gate. A week later, the terrorists were all dead. Tying up loose ends. You're a loose end. That's why I came. Give us the sword and your death will be quick. Let's hope knife catching isn't the only skill you remember. The stone is indomitable. But, it is just a thing. Physical in nature. But, you... you are much more than the physical. Everyday, you will hit the stone. It will hurt, but pain strengthens us. It will burn, but fire cleanses the soul. And then, someday... maybe... the stone will break. But, the journey will make your spirit as indomitable as that stone. Begin! Giving up already, mama? If teacher's pet doesn't have to do it, I'm not doing it either. Man says the stone's going to break. I'm going to break it! Man, this is bullshit! Ben, come on. Naw. Have fun breaking your hands. I'm done, baby. Maybe he's right. Maybe we should turn in. Good night, Bruce. Bruce. I didn't see you. Darkness is a powerful ally, if you know how to befriend it. You will not break the rock tonight. Or tomorrow. Or the next day. Or perhaps ever. You said to break the rock. I said to try to break the rock. I know what happened to you... to your family. The whole world knows. Now, you want to stop that from happening to anyone else. But, evil is as eternal as this rock. Even if you break the rock, there will be pebbles, break the pebbles, there will be sand, and evil remains. You cannot change that, no matter how much you train. Accept what you cannot change. It is not your burden to bear. Life is meant to be lived with others. It is too hard to do it alone. Bruce! Fine. Let's do it the hard way. Peace, love and contentment, my friends. Live low and humbly like the snake. At one with nature. Perfect. Unchanged for a hundred-million years. Give me the numbers. Ten new offices opening throughout the country. The penthouse you requested in Los Angeles, and, interestingly, we've got a new recruit. I hate his movies. But, still, money is money. Yes? Schlangenfaust. Is the problem taken care of? No, sir. The Axe Gang failed. It would seem our quarry is a bit more formidable than we thought. Too much for you to handle? - No. - Good. And, Schlangenfaust... make sure the Axe Gang knows my displeasure. It's already taken care of. So, uh, what was that back there? They've obviously been sent to stop you from interfering. Not that. The mask. The costume? Well? It's a way to keep my lives separate. Safe. It's more than that, Bruce. Those guys were scared shi-- Let's concentrate on the task at hand. We need to get to the sword before anyone else does. So... we need Shiva. We need Shiva. This... is Soul Breaker, one of two swords made centuries ago by the master swordsmith, Muramasa. The metal has been folded too many times to count, making it as flexible as a reed and as strong as stone. It is said, the blade was made with dark magic, making it more than a sword. It is a key to life and death. So, it must be guarded by one... who chooses life. Shiva. Come forward. Because of your focus, strength, and integrity, I bestow upon you the responsibility of safe-guarding this blade, Soul Breaker. Jade, is there something you'd like to say? No, O-Sensei. Please. We are family here. There are no secrets. What troubles you? Shiva is, as you say, a woman of integrity. But, she is soft. She lacks the killer instinct. She doesn't deserve the sword. Oh? And who does? Anyone else. Rip, maybe? He's been here longer than any of us, besides Richard. And you feel that tenure is more important than my judgement? Very well. Rip Jagger, stand. Would you like to be the caretaker of the blade? Yes, O-Sensei. Then, defeat Shiva, and the responsibility will be yours. Yes, O-Sensei. Oh, Shiva, one more thing. You may use only one finger in defense. Say, what? Yes, O-Sensei. Begin! Enough! Know yourself first, then others. Shiva... the sword is yours. Listen, Richard. Shiva isn't the woman you remember. She's changed. Yeah. So it would seem. She's the head of organized crime in Gotham's Chinatown. Known for her ruthlessness and temper. You haven't put on your Halloween mask and tried to stop her yet? I'm... working up to it. Hey! - Yeah! - All right, yeah! Winner! That's me! You dishonor my house. Nothing dishonorable about winning, darlin'! Then, you should have no problem defeating me. Fine. Have it your way. Give me 20 bucks on Shiva. Get him! You're gonna pay for that, Shiva. Come on, then. This grows tiring. Bruce, Richard. I assume you're in some kind of trouble. You could say that. Kill them. You know how to use those? Bruce, this would be a great time to put on that mask. What mask? Bruce has this mask. He puts it on and it's like he's a different person. You're the Batman? Can you both concentrate! They're here for the sword, Shiva! - No! - We're not done yet. They're getting away. Not for long. That's handy. He's heading for the overpass! Is that what I think it is? Shiva, no! Where's the nearest onramp? Through the park. Shiva, get in. They have the sword. We failed. Only if we quit. Suggestions? Ben. Master, the door at the far end of the monastery, why is it forbidden? You said there were no secrets with family. It is the place where all destinies converge. It is why I am here, and someday, if you train hard enough, it will be why you are here too. That doesn't make any sense. Ha! Since when did I start making sense? Geez, Ben. Maybe try to chew your food instead of inhaling it? It takes a lot to look this good. Oh, no, you didn't. There better be some rice left in that bowl, chump, or you and I are gonna have to talk. Sorry, I got the last of it. I'd be happy to share. I don't need your charity, fool! What I need is for you to know your place. And where's that? Behind me. You think we're supposed to give you a break because Mommy and Daddy got killed in front of you? Huh? Happens every day in my neighborhood, only it don't make the paper. You only get what you earn. And from where I'm standing, you ain't earned nothing, turkey. O-Sensei, we have to stop them. No, they need this. Plus, my TV is on the fritz. Come on. Oh, you wanna go? Where do you think you're going? All right, rich boy, I ain't ever gonna turn down whooping somebody's ass. You had enough? Not even close. Stay down. You're crazy, man. I can respect that. I got you. Come on, white rice, let's get you patched up. You know what's strange? I'm kind of hungry. Getting your ass beat does work up an appetite. Ow! - You okay? - I can't do it. I'm not strong enough. Who says? - No one. I just-- - That's right. No one. When I was a kid, I didn't think I was strong enough either. I thought, if I trained hard enough, acted tough, that was gonna be all it took. But it's not. Martial arts is not about mastering a punch, or a kick. It's about mastering what's in here, and here. So that when things are hard, when you don't know if you're strong enough, you can reach inside and remember the truth. What's that? The only thing stopping you... is you. - I'm ready now. - Hell yes, you are. The student has become the teacher. Why do I get the distinct feeling that you're not here to enroll? They found The Gate. And they have the sword. They? Let me get my coat. I don't know why he can't ever just give me a straight answer? He always has to be so cryptic and mysterious. Come on, you should be used to it by now. I bet he hides his most secret techniques behind that door. Or riches. Ancient jewels and gold, hoarded over time. I bet it's something powerful. Something he's too afraid to use. You're all wrong. It's probably a Whirlpool. A luxury spa room to help him achieve Nirvana. Shut up. What about you, Bruce? Got any ideas? Yeah, it's obvious. Really? Do tell. It's a distraction. Good night. I'm still betting on that Whirlpool. What was that? Jade and Rip are missing. So is Soul Breaker. Quickly! Be on guard. Jade! What have you done? What you have been too afraid to do, old man. Why do you think I came here so many years ago? For your teaching? I came for The Gate. The Gate? What's he talking about? What O-Sensei is too afraid to tell you, is that there is a god on the other side of this Gate. One that will make the world right again. He calls to me. And I... I will be the vessel of his divine power. There is no god on the other side, Rip. Only a demon. You have to stop. Stop before it's too late, my son. It's already too late. The Gate requires a sacrifice to open, a soul. And the sword... is the conduit, the key. Stop! Stop, you fool. Do not open that Gate. You're the fool, old man. Rip, listen to your master. Oh, Richard, he was never my master. Stand back. Come! Your servant welcomes you. Yes, the heralds of the great Naga! I am Rip Jagger, your master's humble-- No! This is what I've trained you for. Hy-ah! Die, sucker. Shiva! Hey, over here. The door, it's closing. O-Sensei. It takes a soul to open the door, and sacrifice to close it. No! O-Sensei, there has to be another way. This is my destiny... My purpose. Remember, you are stronger together than apart. Never forget... No! We have to find a way back in. We have to save him. He's gone, Richard. Whatever was on the other side, got him. Come on, brother, we have got to go. Come on. He wouldn't want you to die with him. The Gate is secure. And the sword? It's en route as we speak. Excellent. Double the security around the island. Nothing can interrupt the ceremony once it's begun. Aww, don't be sacred, children. Not yet. Here, aerial photography of the island. There's anti-aircraft artillery all over the place. Here, here and here. The place is crawling with soldiers. This isn't gonna be easy. I say we land in the middle and kill them all. We're good. But even O-Sensei couldn't dodge a bullet. You sure about that? The tunnels... Dig this. There is a series of catacombs beneath the island that lead to the center courtyard. But getting to it, I don't know. What? There is a vertical cave that drops a few hundred feet down. So, we free-fall in, open our chutes and we're in business. The entrance in 10 feet wide. Oh. Then we don't miss. How is it that you know so much about this island, Benjamin? I've been here before. In fact... it's my fault we're in this mess. After what happened to O-Sensei, I needed to work some stuff out. Aah! I came across a cobra symbol. It was identical to Rip's. That's when I learned about the Kobra Cult, a worldwide organization of murderous zealots. They had temples all over the globe. Deeper I dug, the more I found. And I meant to stop every damn one of 'em. Each one led me to someone higher up in the food chain. I smashed their operations all over the world. In fact, Kobra started getting a little scared of me. I'd become a sort of Boogeyman. I read a file about some one hassling those Kobras. What did they call you? Black Samurai? Naw, man. I was the "Bronze Tiger." - Ah. - Nice. I like it. Turns out, these cats believe in some obscure prophesy. Some chosen one. A messiah of such power that he can became the avatar of their great snake god. A dude names Jeffrey Burr. All I had to do was kill him. He was just a kid. I just couldn't do it. I left. Came home. Started to teach. Help these kids like O-Sensei helped me. I forgot all about Kobra. You did the right thing. - Did he? - Shiva. If he had slit that little bastard's throat, none of us would be here. He was an innocent. So was Hitler, once upon a time. But give me a time machine, and I'd toss his bassinet into a volcano. Enough. What's done is done. Let's focus on the mission. We're near the drop zone. Time to get ready. And lucky for you, I brought supplies. Tight. Listen, we need every advantage we can get out there. So you damn well better be wearing that outfit of yours. The opening's about a half a klick that way. Let's go. No use hiding. I know you're there. Please come out. Move! Unless you want me to add your bones to the others. Such spirit. I will take great pleasure in watching you die by my hands. What the funky hell? Please. Do come closer. You really shouldn't have done that. - His hand. - I can see that, Richard. No, the other one. So... No blades. Ha! Richard, Shiva, get topside. Ben and I will take care of these two. The sword. At last. The time has come for the great Naga to walk this Earth. No borders, no countries, no politicians trying to hold us down. One king. One ruler. One god. Take solace, my children. Your sacrifice will not be in vain. I want my sword back. Kill them! Hy-ah! Stop them. King Snake, Lady Eve, do your duty. I'll take the girl Her look offends me. The infamous Richard Dragon. And you are? Sir Edmund Dorrance. But you may call me... King Snake. I think I'll call you "dead meat." I can smell your fear. No, no, no. Please, no! We can't keep doing this. I might have something that could help. Mace? Against them? Worth a try. Hang on. Burn, baby. Burn. Next time, pack something with a punch. Fool. You gave up your weapon. I am the weapon. Aah! It's no use. You're as loud as a bull in a china shop. Argh! My god is coming. And when he does, you will die. You hear me? You will... Be waiting to kick his ass. Lead them to the jungle, quickly. Wait. When you're far enough away, push this button. Help will find you. - Did you take care of "snake hands"? - Damn right. Don't come any closer. Help me! Aah! Your sacrifices are gone. Your men, defeated. You're finished. No. My god will come for me. You don't wanna meet your god. Trust me. You're wrong. I'm the chosen one. It's my destiny. That's what they had you believe. You were a child when they took you. They told you, you were special. But it's all a lie. This whole thing is a lie. No. No! Give me the sword. Without a soul, it won't open anyway. Don't you think I know that. No! I am the chosen one. He will save me. You'll see. He will... Oh, God! It burns! The sword. It hurts. No! Get ready. Whatever comes out of there, we have to stop it. No matter what. For O-Sensei. For O-Sensei. Master? You're alive. Yes. Something like that. I can feel your master, scrabbling in the back of my mind. He's so disappointed in you. Ben Turner, with his uncontrollable anger. Shiva, who failed to guard his blade. Bruce Wayne, the perpetual child, who thought he could defeat evil. And Richard... Oh, Richard. The plans he had for you. Who are you? The one which was foretold. The great Naga. The harbinger of destruction. Listen... Even now my hordes are making their way to The Gate ready to lay waste to your soft world. Release our master. There is no release. There is only death! It is time to bring your world to its knees before me. Good... Good. Your master has taught you well. But it won't be enough. Argh! Hmph! Bruce. O-Sensei has shown me you are the least skilled of them all, though he admires your determination. Your private battle to save Gotham. Uh, but... the truth is, you are just a sad little boy trying to quiet the ghosts of the past. You should have heeded your master's words. Evil is eternal. I'm coming for your world. And you are powerless to stop me. What are you going to do, Bruce? What do you have that your comrades don't? A cape. As I said... sad. You don't deserve to look like him. Don't worry. This form is just temporary. I can only exist in your world with a proper shell. Haven't you figured it out yet? That to stay in this world, I need an avatar. Someone strong enough to hold my spirit. Your O-Sensei was a clever one. Hiding him in plain sight. A young boy, trained in the ways of war. His true destiny hidden from him. The one who can hold the great serpent. The one they call... Dragon. And here you are... right in front of me. It is your destiny. I can give you power beyond your imagining. Purpose. Isn't that what you always desired? No. You have such power in you, Richard. O-Sensei knew it. You are the only one strong enough to contain my spirit. If I'm the only one strong enough to hold you, then I'm the only one strong enough to defeat you. Heh! You cannot defeat me. Yeah, I think I can. This is my destiny. To be the best fighter there is. And no one... Not even some second-rate demon god is going to stop that. I had hoped you would come willingly. But no matter, I will take you by force. Richard! You can't destroy me, Richard. I am forever. My soul will live on... For eternity. Soul, did you say? No. Richard... You are more than I... I could ever hope for. Thank you, my son. And Bruce... your parents would be proud. O-Sensei. Then it's over. No. We have to close The Gate. Yeah. About that. It needs a sacrifice to close, and well... I have a lot to atone for. No, I should go. O-Sensei left me the sword. It is the honorable thing to do. You're both wrong. This is my burden to bare. Where's white rice? You think I'm gonna let your jive ass take all the glory? Get out before they-- - You shouldn't have-- - Please. I've had enough of men telling me what I should and shouldn't do. We're in this together, Bruce. Just like we've always been. Like we're supposed to be. We are "the Dragon." Are you crying? No. All right then. Let's get it on.
