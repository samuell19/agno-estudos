Why does she have to leave now? Yeah, Sona dropped me. Not Ootty. Coonoor station. Okay, Arun. Bye, Roshan. - Bye, bye. See you in Kerala, Sona. - Okay. Love you. Take care. - Sure. The train is about to leave. Go quickly. Bye. Let's go! - Okay. Yes, Arun. I have mailed it. Yes, at 9:30. Hey! The train is about to leave. - Listen! Many people will come without tickets. Don't open the door for them. Okay then. Bye. Hey! Watch out! You'll fall down! Wow! Where is it? Open it. It's not opening! Open the door. It's my seat over there. Please open the door. I have to get in. Brother... I mean, sister. What do I call her? Madam! Please open the door. Please help me, lady! The train is leaving. Open the door! My shawl! Hey! Through this magic wand, you can see the sun, the moon and all the stars in the universe. Oops. Sorry, sorry! Are you mad? - Yes. It's all my fault. Here you go. If someone's knocking on the door, why can't you open it? Aren't you ashamed... - For what? ... to travel without a ticket? What about this? She seems like a big shot! Oh no! Sorry, sorry. What is this? I didn't mean to. - Give it here. Keep it back, dear. Is your phone broken? - Are you blind or what? School trip? Kerala? Yes. - Oh! Mallus? My brothers? That's awesome! Here you go. Take it. Wow. - I'm too good, right? I want one too. Here you go. - Thanks. No problem. Thanks. - Oh! Keep it. You can take it. Thank you. - Welcome. No response! So much attitude, bloody-dee-dee-dee... Which book are you reading? Harry Potter and Chamber of Secrets. Hey! Behind you. Sara! - What is it? Why are you looking at just that? What's wrong in that? If you keep looking at it, will you be able to see this beautiful world around you? There are some people here. They don't even know what's happening around them. They're of no use to anyone. Such a waste of space! Hey! Some people will play games, some will read books. It's their choice. - That's right. Why don't you mind your own business? Him and his lousy philosophy. Sorry. Actually, I have read this book. That didn't work. Let me get back to the kids then. Are you kids travelling on this train for the first time? - Yes. But I've travelled many times. Actually, this is called 'snail rail'. We can get out of this train and walk along with it, if we want to. I don't usually sit inside this train. I get out and run along with it. And there's something else too. Saw these two poles? I hold on to them and hang like this. And I'd just glide along with the wind. What's your name? Dulquer Salmaan. That's a lie. Tell us your actual name. Harry. - Harry Potter? No. This is just Harry. Why? Don't you have a second name? No, I don't have a second name. All of us have it. You didn't have one in school? - No. I'm not so interested in it. But you can tell us. Don't tease me. No, we won't. Okay. Harry Menon. She's laughing! This is why I don't say it. Hey! - Yes? They are children, right? Why are you lying to them? Even if I lie or say the truth, people who we meet on a journey or their names, are relevant only till the end of the journey, right? There you go again! Hey, you? - Are you Harry? Yes. You want to see magic? Yes. - Please. Thanks. Evanesco! It's flying! You've been showing off for a while now. That too, to my friends! You are not Harry Potter. Okay? Okay. Where's my book? Hey! Where's my book? - It's gone! Where did it go? - This is common in magic. You took the book saying that you'll do a magic trick, right? What are you doing? Sheesh! Don't hit me! I was just joking. Please! No! Carrot! Carrot! Carrot! Sister! You want carrot, dear? - How much is it? 50 Rupees. Here you go. Wait. You can keep the change. Oh my God! Oh no! Sister! Wait! I am coming. It's okay. - Are you alright? Are you okay? Do you feel tired? - I'll be okay, dear. Wait. I'll help you up. Come on. Careful. I'm letting you go now. Manu, I'm asking you to sit down. Hey Dulquer Salmaan! Stop! Let's reach Mettupalayam. I'll teach you a lesson! Thank you so much, dear. Oh no! The train is leaving! Stop! Stop! Hello! I haven't gotten in. - You kids are messing with me? Hello! - Where did she go? Hello! Stop! Stop! - Huh? Carrots? I am tired. Hey! I haven't gotten in. Hello! Where were you? - Hey! Hello! Please help me. - Hi! Hey! When someone is running to catch a train, those who're inside should help them. Understood? Come! Come on! Sorry. Please. Please help me up. Now you know how I felt? It's okay. Come on! Hold my hand. - I'll set you straight! Oh my God! Hey! Stop! Stop! Who will stop now? - Don't go! I haven't gotten in! Help! Stop! Hey! Wait! Stop! Stop! This is why you shouldn't help anyone. We're trapped! You can't just run and catch it like a local Kerala bus. It's gone. Your bag! Get lost! - I will go. Don't go that side. It's the forest. If you want to reach somewhere quickly, you should walk back. I was just saying. It's your choice. And I'm familiar with these routes. My bag is gone along with the train. How much should I walk to reach the road, from this jungle? Awesome! Hey! Don't worry. Don't say anything! All this happened because of you! You jumped out of the train first, and when I tried to help you get back in, you pulled me out. And you're angry at me? It's alright. Once you hit the road, you can reach Mettupalayam before the train reaches there. You just shut up! It's the forest. You can get rid of this attitude. Excuse me! What's your name? You don't have a name? Nayanthara. Nayanthara? - Yes. Where's your house, Nayanthara? Andaman! Andaman! That's too far, right? My house is in Ottappalam. Oh! It must be the famous 'Varikkassheri Mana'. That's in Manisshery, right? This one's on the road opposite Ambika Movie Theatre. If you go straight, you can see a huge Banyan tree. You can see a ground near that tree. If you go straight from there, the third house on the left is my house! Must be a huge mansion, right? Yes. It's an old building. If you look out from my house, you can even see the procession from Poonchirakkavu temple. And yeah! There will be many relatives there, right? Of course! My uncles, aunts and their children... All of us were together long back. But everyone should get back to the house for the temple festival. That's a must! Elephant? - We had one. Neelaandan. But we sold him off. - So sad! There was no one to take care of him. And you have a huge mango tree in your courtyard, right? Yes! Don't you tie a swing on its branch? Yes! You know everything, huh? Hey! I also watch Malayalam movies, okay? You little devil! Hey! Are you a cameraman or what? Move away. - No. Okay. Do you have a phone with you? Do you have a phone? Here you go. Shucks! Won't this turn on? Oops. Just a second! Battery! Phone and battery are separate? Where does he come from? No! Shucks! Take it. - Thank you. Go and swallow it! Okay. Apart from this phone and a pair of sunglasses, you don't have anything with you, right? We need to reach somewhere where we can get a phone, at the earliest. Why? We have to call the railway station and make sure our luggage is safe. And we have to reach Mettuppalayam from there, quickly. The time is.. - So much to do! What is this? Don't look up! It must be blood. Tribals usually kill people and hang them on trees. Oh no! Let me see. It's blood indeed. Look over there. Did you get scared? I'm coming. Hi. I am Ranga. - Hi brother. You want honey? - Yes. Can we get it for free? For free? Why not? Just a second. Where do you want to go? Mettuppalayam. If we cross that hill, we'll reach our 'Manthu'. If you take the road from there, you can reach Mettuppalayam in 1.5 hours. This is our 'Manthu'. 'Manthu'? - Yes. Nice, right? - It's a very special day here. Come, let's go and see. Come on! Lift it! Come on, lift it! Actually, this is very simple. It's not strength that matters here. It's technique! Like, it's about the grip and hold. If you can't do it, practice and do it later. Please don't say that, sir. This is my fifth attempt! You can't do it! You're not worthy of getting married. Please don't say that, sir. If you can't do it, take the help of someone else. Okay. See if someone else is willing to help you. Is there anyone else? Why isn't anyone helping him? Only unmarried people are allowed to lift that rock. Can outsiders help him? Isn't there anyone else? Come on, tell me! Aha! Thank God! Can't you do a good deed for others? - No way! - Oh God! You are my God! -You're the God who came for me. -What God? - Please help me, sir. - Are you an outsider? - Yes, sir. - So... Is it okay for us if we allow an outsider to do it? It's a good deed, right? As per our culture, if he's interested, let him do it. Yours is the final word, sir. - Please save me, sir. - Sheesh! - I don't trust myself. - But I trust you. Please come. My dear bro, I don't really work out much. Please come, sir. - Sir! Sir! - Will you be able to do it? - Will I be able to do it? - Tell me! Yes. Where's the girl? Girl? Girl? How can you do it without a girl? There's a girl. Look! Nayanthara. The one who'd bring prosperity to this village. Come here, dear. The girl is ready. What's all this? Can't you a do a good deed for others? In that case, we can conduct the engagement now. Before the last full moon day of the coming dinner, we can conduct your wedding. Give that lamp to me. Once you receive this lamp, you can leave this village, only after your engagement. Engagement? The two of you go and lift that rock. Hey sweetheart! Prove that you're a hero! Come, bro. Don't you want to get married? Bro, use this golden chance! Hold it. Come on, lift it. Phew! Hey! Don't fall at my feet. It's fine. Are you wondering why he's falling at your feet? He had failed to lift the rock five times. His engagement happened only now. - That too, only because of you. - Enough! - Let's go. It's over, right? - This is nothing. - Thanks a lot, Madam. - Where? You made their wedding happen. The two of you should come for the next full moon day. Your wedding should also happen here. Wedding? The song has begun! Come, let's go and see. *** Hey girl *** *** Wearing a new Saree *** *** Adorning a flower garland *** *** Come on to the wedding stage *** *** Like rain water *** *** Your shyness is spilling *** *** As you hear the drumbeats *** *** It's your wedding celebration *** *** The nuptial chain made of the golden lotus is for you *** *** My darling, beautiful girl *** *** O' maiden, a gift you've never seen before *** *** Is awaiting you on your wedding night today *** *** Don't worry about tomorrow Let's celebrate this moment *** *** Hey! Pick it up slowly and gently *** *** And raise it above your head This wedding rock *** *** Like rain-water, the bride is here *** *** Dance and celebrate in front of the Lord *** *** O' wind, rushing off to unseen distances *** *** Can you stay with me for a few moments? *** *** You can leave after celebrating with the drumbeats and songs *** *** You can leave seeing the bride's beauty *** *** You can climb up the hill that's spread around *** *** You can leave with loving smiles and words *** *** Go away for some time *** *** O' sorrows in my heart *** *** These are magical moments offered by time that would disappear on their own *** *** O' darling girl of the land of 'Thoda' *** *** I've been searching for you, my girl *** *** In the month of 'Aadi', at the temple *** *** It's the wedding we always wished for *** *** Don't worry about tomorrow Let's celebrate this moment *** Oh no! We didn't give Ranga anything. That's not necessary. They are much richer than we are. Sigh! It's already late. Now, we have to hitch a ride to Mettuppalayam, get the bags from Mettuppalayam and head to Coimbatore, and then... What is this? Didn't understand? No. It's a bracket. Bracket? In a paragraph, the things which we write within a bracket, don't have any grammatical connection, to things that are written before and after that bracket, right? Yeah. So? Aren't we inside a bracket like that? I mean, the incidents happening now... don't have any connection, with things that happened earlier in our lives, or that are going to happen in future, right? Within this bracket, it's just us, now. We'll go, right? What's that? Hey! A vehicle is coming. Where? Come! Come! Run! - Come on, run! - Hello! Hello! Lift! Lift! - Hello! Stop the car. - Wave your hand! - Lift! - Stop! Stop! Lift! Hello! Komusta? What? - Hello! - Ola! - Ola. Yes, Ola. - Spanish? English? Spanish! Malayali. - You English? - No English. Only Spanish. Sigh! Spanish? How do we ask for a lift in Spanish? Yes. Got it. Straight going... Mettuppalayam... Mettu... Palayam... Driving... Honking.. No? - Where are you going, sir? - - Destino? - Yes. Destination! Yes, yes. Kerala! Did you see that? They're going to Kerala. Shall we go? But how do we trust these people whose language we don't know? So what if we don't know their language? They are not unplanned like you. See! They have a map! Oh! Okay, then. Sir! Kerala? Lift? - Come on. - Okay, thank you. - Phew! Such a relief. - He doesn't know Malayalis well enough. I'll get in first. Thank you! Thank you! Gracias! Name? Nombre? That's not how you pronounce it. It's Nombre. - Nombre. - That's correct. Nombre. - Nombre. - Nombre. Nombre is name. Thank you is Gracias. Where have we reached? I don't know. This looks just like Ootty. Nice place. What's the time? It's been around one and a half hours since we got in. And we haven't reached Mettuppalayam yet? That's 3 hours away, right? That's by train, right? By road, it's just 1.5 hours, maximum. Yeah! God! Where have we reached now? Gudalur? Where is this? We've taken the long route. There are two routes to reach Kerala by road, from Ootty. You can reach Palakkad via Mettuppalayam and Coimbatore, or reach Kozhikode via Gudalur and Sulthan Bathery. These two routes are on opposite directions! No! - Ma'am! Stop the vehicle! Please! - Madam, stop the vehicle! Wait! We were mistaken! Stop the vehicle, please! That's a bus to Ootty! Come on, get down. - Get down quickly. - Brother, stop the bus! Stop! You took us on a wrong route! Thank you so much! See you so much! Bye! Oh no! - I didn't take my bag. - Come quickly! Get the bag. - Brother, one minute. - Come quickly! - My bag! My bag! - We're coming! - It's time! Start the bus. - Thank you so much. Gracias! - Gracias! - Come quickly! - Come quickly! - Adios! Adios! Wasting my time! What is he doing? Bye! Bye! See you, boy! - Oh no! Don't go! I wasn't saying bye. - Give me my bag! - Come back! - Bye! Bye! Bye! Stop the bus, brother! - Please don't go! - Stop! Stop! We aren't saying bye, bro! My life will end running behind all these vehicles! Even the foreigner left? The bus has also left. Good. - These problems... started ever since I saw you. Have you come with me to kill me? But weren't you the one who jumped into their car saying that they had a map? Why did I even... I don't need anyone's help now. I know what to do next. Hey! If there are wild bulls and elephants on this route, convey my regards to them. You're leaving, right? There won't be any problem hereafter. Then it's fine. Wow! Rain! It's raining like crazy! Think how we can escape from here, together. Look over there. I think it's a house. Wear it if you want to. It's been 33 years since I lost my peace of mind. Everyone else thinks that people in Ootty are living in heaven! Come on! Pass! Pass! - This is hell! Hell! Goal! Him and his damn goal! I'll set you straight! Bloody nuisance! - Have you gone crazy, Mummy? Yes! You've grown as big as a pig and I'm still feeding you, right? I am crazy indeed! Not responsible about anything. Don't you know how old you are? What have I done, for you to shout so much? I was late to reach the railway station. So what? They will come here in another car. You left from here at 10 o'clock, right? I reached there at 10:30, Mummy. - And then? When I reached there, I didn't have a platform ticket. Why didn't you go and wait there before the train arrived? That train... Phew! Saved by the power cut. - Did you say something? - No! It was very well lit when we looked from there, right? Must be a power cut. Let's go and check anyway. What do you want now, Mummy? Do you want guests? I'll bring as many guests as you want, tonight. Want to see that? Get going. - Where? Didn't you say that you'll bring guests? Go and bring them. In this night? - Huh? Didn't you just say that you'll bring guests? Now come back here only with guests. - Mummy! You're sending your son out at midnight. Are you even a mother, Mummy? - Get out. Get going. If you try to open this, I'll chop off your hand. Shut up! Come back only when you find guests. I am scared, Mummy! That didn't work. Who's that? Who are you? What do you want? I am Harry. I am Sam. What... what do you want? We lost our way in the forest... and then we saw this light.. - You don't have to talk in Tamil. You can talk in Malayalam. We have to get back to Ootty. How can we get back? Can we get a taxi? Taxis won't be available at this time. The check-post will be shut past 8 PM. The next bus is at 8 o'clock in the morning. Huh? Only in the morning? You'll have to walk otherwise. Which route can we take? You can take this route. That one? There won't be trouble from elephants. - Alright. - Just wild bulls. Wild bulls? - Oops. Or else, you can stay here. This is a home-stay. That's not possible. What else can we do now? - Hey! Just that we have a few conditions. You don't have a problem, right? We don't have any problem. Come on then. Open the door. Open the door, Madam! Who are they? - Guests! Please come, please come. Welcome. - Hello! My name is Mary. I am Harry. - I am Marykkutty. Oh! Mary is a cutie? Who's this? This is Mrs. Harry. - Yes. Why? Mrs. Harry doesn't have a name or what? - Yes. Baby. Baby! Just Baby? Kadayadi Baby. She's from a reputed family. Do you have ID cards? - Of course. No? - No. You don't? You can leave then. Hey Mummy! Please don't insult me. I had a tough time convincing them. Don't say anything. They don't have luggage. No ID cards. How can we trust them? Auntie, we lost our way in the forest. We don't know the route to go back. We've given all the cash we had to Sam. Please help us. Please! Please, Aunty. Okay... but you have to check out in the morning itself. We have other guests coming. Huh? - Yes, the other guests? Oh yeah! They are coming! Thank you, Mummy. Got drenched in the rain, right? I'll give you some nightwear or pajamas. You ask him for clothes to change into. - Thank you, Aunty. Good night. Mummy came to Ootty as a teacher. And she got settled here after getting married to my Papa. Papa worked in Indian Railways. After Papa's death, we continued here with this home-stay and chocolate baking. This is your room. Huh? - Oh no! The power is gone again! This is usual here. Don't worry. I'll bring a candle. You guys get settled down by then. This dress suits you really well. You're looking beautiful. Why are you silent? I understood! This is your first time, huh? Mine too! What? Have you spent a night in a room with a man before this, Baby? What is it, Baby? Are you afraid? I don't have any such fears. Why? What's this for? Self-defense. But why do you need this here? Three inches below this, on the left side, you have your heart. And below that, you have your lungs. Two inches below that, you have your pancreas. 4 inches to the right from there, on top of it, you have your liver. At any of these spots... I can give you one stab! Yes. The stab is what matters! Not just that. The way the knife is held matters as well. If the target is taller than us, the knife should be pointed forward. Or... if he is shorter, it should be held inwards like this. If I stab at any of these spots, a surgery has to be conducted within half an hour. If it's not done, death is confirmed. Your hometown is in Kannur, huh? I'll sleep there. So I won't have a blanket? Blanket? You can keep it. It's okay. You can take the pillow. I can? Thank you. Thank you. Hey! Are you going to jump from there? Come here and see. I can't do that. If you do only what you can, you can never do what you can't, in your entire life. Wow! So beautiful. It looks so beautiful when we look from here itself. What if we could see the earth, standing as tall as the stars? I remember someone else saying this a long time go. Have you ever dreamt of jumping off from a great height? I dream about it often. A dream in which I jump off a huge cliff, to die. Why? Do you want to die so badly? It's not like that. Only when we are fed up of our current lives, and wish for something new, we see such dreams. Fed up of life? You? It needn't be because I'm fed up. It can be to forget too. Shall I go? We have to leave early in the morning, right? Hey! Good night. That's enough. You have to keep stirring it until it is mixed properly. Shall I do it? You need to be really patient. - Okay. Just like this. These particles shouldn't remain. - Okay. Oh no! I'll be right back! Hey! I saw it. What did you see? You're making the chocolate in such an unhygienic way? Tone it down. - No way! Aunty! - Please! Then... give me some. What? Chocolate! What did you think I meant? Yeah, right. I won't give you the chocolate. Is Marykutty Teacher's chocolate so cheap? So unhygienic? What do you want now? Here, take it! This is very little. That's enough for you. I'll adjust with this for the time being. Hey! - What do you want now? Don't be angry. Let me ask you something. Ask! Do you know the connection between good chocolate and a good life partner? What is it? If we have a good chocolate, each and every moment in our life, will be sweet. Aha! What about a good life partner? If you have a good life partner? Every moment spent with them, will be a sweet memory. Philosophy, huh? No, I'm serious. Hey! Oops! You were here, huh? Now it's completely sweet. Breakfast is ready. Sorry. Please come. What are you looking for? Soap! - Oh! Soap? Here you go! Who asked you to take this? I took it when I saw it. Oh! You'll take everything that you see? What's the problem? I can pay you for this as well, when we reach Mettuppalayam. I've kept it here. So much drama for taking a soap? You can use it if you want to. You don't have to pay me any money. Get lost! Thank you! This is for you, dear. Don't give it to him, okay? Shall we leave, Aunty? Bye, Aunty. - Bye. Hey! You should come here again, dear. But next time, you should come after getting married to him. We should have just remained as children always, right? We'll be happy all the time! Happy? While you are a child, you have a belief, that anything we wish for, will happen. That belief is destroyed when you lose your mother. The entire childhood is destroyed. There are buses from here, every 30 minutes. Okay. We reach Ootty on a bus from here. From there, we go to Mettuppalayam. Wow! Great! You've become quite the travel planner, huh? That's the plan. Once we reach Mettupalayam, we go our own ways from there. Come. Wow! This looks nice! What is this? A tree that produces nuptial chains? Why do you have to mock it? People have different beliefs, right? If you want to get married, there's no point tying a nuptial chain to a tree. You have to find a girl and tie it on her neck! As if girls are just objects meant for men to select and tie their nuptial chains! You were a feminist? I didn't mean that. What's the point in tying a nuptial chain? They don't even look at each others' faces at that moment. That must be because they don't want their deceit to be caught. That's not how it should be. People should get married, looking into each others' eyes. No need of a nuptial chain or any of these rituals. When you look at each other like that, the trust that you get. That is marriage. Will your wedding be like that? These desires and ideas of mine... ... are all within a bracket, like you said. And they don't have any other connection to my life. Now, your desires and ideas can live within this, right? Where are you going? Bus! Plan! But I am within this bracket until we reach Mettupalayam, right? So, how are plans relevant there? Come! Come quickly! Enough! Have you gone crazy? I want to do so many things here. Tell me. - I want to go to a carrot farm, pluck out carrots and eat them. I need Ootty flowers. But we shouldn't pay money for them. I need to pluck it from the plants. Just a second. 1. Carrot from a carrot farm. 2. Get Ootty flowers without spending money. These are old fashioned ideas, right? Say something fresh! Fresh, huh? I want to dance in the middle of a crowd, without bothering about anyone around me. That's nice. Street dance. You mean break dance? Break dance on the street. Next? Shall I ask you something? Go ahead. What's happening right now, does not have any connection to our lives ahead, right? No connection. Then... shall I romance you within this bracket? Well... But you don't know who I am, and what kind of a person I am, right? Those are all matters outside this bracket, right? What I am asking... is from here to here. Oh! You mean, from this hill to Mettupalayam? Sheesh! What? What do I say? If you ask me if you could romance me... You can! But I have a small condition. If it's a kiss, that's not possible. How did you understand that? Everyone knows that, right? Is it? Not possible! Not possible? - Nope. If that's not possible... there's another bus in five minutes. I'm leaving. Hey! Huh! She called me! What is it? You want a kiss? Yes. *** Come, climbing the hills of dreams *** *** Come, the sky is calling us, stretching its arms *** *** On this chapter we've snatched from the corners of our lives, *** *** Let's scribble desires that would fade away *** *** O' sweetness beside my heart *** *** Come along with me, on this journey, with your eyes closed *** *** O' sweetness beside my heart *** *** Come along with me, on this journey, with your eyes closed *** *** Beside my heart *** *** I wish this moment never ends *** *** I wish this time never disappears *** *** What if they stayed still, as much as we want? *** *** What if we stood as the eye of the star at the foothills of the sky *** Hey! Careful! Why do you get so restless when you see pregnant women? That's a matter beyond this bracket, right? Let it remain so. Though we are within this bracket, I do feel like knowing more about you, sometimes. Let's do something then. We can ask one question each to each other. It can be about our past, future or anything else. But only one question. Okay. Shall I ask you? Why did you come to Ootty? School get-together. So, you studied here? Till my 8th grade. What about these pregnant women? - Your turn to ask a question is over. I didn't ask the main question. - Shall I ask now? Ask me. Hey! If God appeared before you, and asked you what you wish for, what will you ask him for? My mother. I'll say that I want my mother. Why so? One question is over. Look over there. Is it what I think it is? So much smoke! Nice, right? Nice. - Shall we go there? *** We will be rushing in search of different shores tomorrow *** *** Who are you, O' cool breeze? *** *** As snow within the nest of the palms, these moments will disappear *** *** On this chapter we've snatched from the corners of our lives, *** *** Let's scribble desires that would fade away *** *** O' sweetness beside my heart *** *** Come along with me, on this journey, with your eyes closed *** *** O' sweetness beside my heart *** *** Come along with me, on this journey, with your eyes closed *** *** Beside my heart *** *** Beside my heart *** You haven't lost anything, right? So... So? Where are you going next? Next... to Coimbatore. I'll be there for a few days now. I'm going to Kerala. If you're going to Kerala, there's a straight bus. So it'd be good to go on a bus. So, now? How much money do I owe you? Should I take it? There shouldn't be any debts. I didn't give it to you as cash. So I don't need it back as cash. You said you're going to Coimbatore, right? So buy a ticket to Coimbatore, for me as well. So that we can travel together till then? Let the end of our journey together be in Coimbatore. I can't believe this. I can't imagine even in my wildest dreams that I did all this. But you forgot one thing. Street dance? I don't think I can do that in this lifetime. And there's only half an hour left for this bracket to expire, right? Ticket! Ticket! Have you bought the ticket? Hey! I have only the love for you in my mind now. I swear! I'm thinking only about that. In this bus... in that song... In this bag... In this soap... This soap is mine, right? Do you see me everywhere? In my life so far, I have seen some special things. I have seen Shah Jahan's Taj Mahal, I have seen the first smile of a newborn baby, and I have seen the first day, first show of Mohanlal's 'Pulimurugan'. But this journey is much more beautiful than all that. A journey in this bus, till the end of life, with you. But it's really difficult to tolerate you even for one day! I'm serious! Now... Back to the life outside this bracket. Back to life. Same old life. Let's go! It's time. The bus is about to leave. Palakkad, Thrissur, Ernakulam, Thiruvananthapuram... Come on, Madam! Come! The bus is about to leave. Let's go! Hey! Who are you? What's your name? Where's your house? Even I don't like myself, in my life outside that bracket. Let me live as someone whom I like, at least in one person's mind. You came from somewhere... and you're going somewhere else now. It's time. Come inside. - Take care. - Thank you, Doctor. Nima, this is your first case. Good job! That was a complicated one. Thank you, Doctor. You know one thing? My house-surgency period was a nightmare. What happened? You seem to be really moody. Well, I had night duty for this whole week, Doctor. That's why. A doctor should not be taking care of patients' health alone. You've been here since yesterday morning, right? Yes. Don't you want to go home? Yes. It's late already. I have to get going. It's not late. Early! It's early morning now. So... get going quickly. Okay? - See you. - See you, Doctor. Yes, Arun. I'll be there at 9:30, sharp. I'm at home now. Oh no! Just two. At the restaurant? Okay. I'll come there. Mummy, I've kept your breakfast ready in the casserole. Did you have breakfast? I'll have it later. I'm already late. Neha! Are you coming? Bye, Papa. - Catch it. - Bye! - Bye, Mom! - Bye! Babuetta! One love! - Hi. - Hi! Okay, bye! No. - Thanks. - Welcome, sir. What's the time now? - Err... I.. - I don't need your excuses. Where? - What? - The mail. Didn't I say that I'll send it in the morning? Didn't the sun rise already? Don't you have a phone? Can't you set a reminder on it? The responsibility of a doctor who works in a hospital, is not just treating patients. Anything else, sir? You had food, right? - I don't need anything. - Okay, sir. Papa had called from Delhi. When is Sir coming back? Second week of January. He asked me when we're planning to get married. I said it can be after two more years. I think that would be better for you too. Arun, well... Excuse me. Hey! What are you going to do with this DGO alone? You should get an MS or MD. That will be a value addition for our hospital, as well. It's not that. That's not what you told my Papa, right Arun? - And Papa is... - Nima, you have to be practical. Do you want to be a failure like your father, without any kind of planning? Don't ruin your potential. Hey! You're not paying attention! Sorry. It's okay. Back when we got acquainted, you were so focused. You know what? You know what Jonas Salk has said? "If all the insects were to disappear from the earth, within 50 years, all life on earth would end" So we should not destroy any species in nature. Can we kill mosquitoes? You can kill mosquitoes which bite you. Okay. Okay, Uncle. Hey! When you call me 'Uncle', it sounds very formal. - Is it? - You can call me Harry or something else. Something friendly! Okay dude! - Hi, Catherine Joshua! - Hi Krishna! Okay, dudette! Raviyetta, a double Boost drink, please. -Make it strong! -I won't mind it if you curse my father. But I can't bear this. Go away, you... Oh my God! Hey! What happened? Who did this to him? Thank you, brother. Master! Do you remember me? Master! I could meet you finally! You entered at the right time. - I was going to kill him otherwise. - Kill him? - Hey! Are you on my side or his? - Get lost, you dog! Let him go! What are you staring at? Get lost! - Come, let's sit here. - Bring the drink here. Make it two! Why did you hit him, Master? He said that my play was bad, on my face! - Did he say so? We'll kill him right away. - Forget it. Let him go! Come, let's talk. Cheers! O Lord! What are you doing here? Performing a play! What else? It's in a school nearby. Which one is it? 'A country is lying' by Shanthan. Won't you come for it? - When is it? - At 8 PM, tomorrow. I'll come then. What are you doing now? Are you done with art works? I write travel journals for a magazine now. Travel journals? Quit all that, man! And come back... so that we can get back on the stage and perform together! Yeah, I'll come. You should come. That's the only place where you can shout out all the truths in life. Theatre! I will come. I have some work left to finish. Give me 300 Rupees. I need it urgently. I have 300, exactly. Or forget it. Why are you acting so formal with me? I have money. I will adjust. Why did you ask me then? You want to know? You know what's the easiest way to find out if a person's character has changed? It's by asking him for money. I wanted to know whether you have changed. And what have you understood? You will never learn! - Is that so? - So, what's the plan for the day? I have to meet a friend of mine today. Before I could tell her, she hooked up with that guy. Manju. Nice name. And then? Then... I used the 'Head to shoulders' technique. 'Head to shoulders' technique? Well, if your girlfriend has another lover, the best technique you can use is 'Head to shoulders'. What is it? It has four steps. Step 1 : Friendship. Okay. First, you should become friends with the girl whom you're in love with. And then, you should keep talking about her lover and love life. Step 2 : Waiting. For what? In the meanwhile, this lover will do something this girl doesn't like. You should wait for that. Are you sure? Definitely! Once you become her boyfriend, can you do everything as per her wish? That's not possible. You are right. Step 3. This is the most important step. The girl will share that with you, with a lot of grief, as she considers you her best friend. So we should say, 'It's all right. Forget it. Don't worry' and all that... and we'll extend our shoulder for her to rest her head. 'Head to shoulders' How is it? It's interesting. What about your 'Head to shoulders'? The 'Head to shoulders' phase is over. Next is Step Four. Surprise proposal. I need your help for that, to devise a plan. What plan? Some plan. But what can I do, all alone? You don't have to be alone. I'll get you an awesome team. Don't worry. I'll try then. Nima! Dr. Sujay is on leave today. Can you do night duty today? Arun, it's Christmas tomorrow. I haven't prepared anything. I'm stressed about the year- ending accounts. How can no one be here? You give me a solution. I'll leave now then. I'll reach back by 5 PM, after arranging everything at home. Make it 3 PM, okay? You are a lifesaver! Thanks. Hey! Yo! This is Reny. This is Nachu. These are the awesome dudes I told you about. - Hi, man! - Hello. - And this is.. ... Deepa. - Hi. Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. Now tell me the plan. Not because I made it.... but this is the most excellent plan for your proposal. Stop the build-up and come to the matter. Okay. Well, imagine that you go inside a coffee shop with your Manju. You order a coffee. That's when Deepa will make her entry. When she comes, you should fight with him saying that you cheated on her, and leave. - Done. - You should go after her then. - Okay? - What about Manju then? I am here for that, right? I'll sing a song she likes, playing the guitar... and bring her out of the coffee shop smoothly. As you step out of the coffee shop, Blast No. 1. And when I bring her downstairs to meet him, Blast No. 2 should happen. What is it? Nasik Dhol? Band? He is in charge of Nasik Dhol. I'm in charge of confetti. Whatever! You can decide that between yourselves. After that, when I bring her to you, what will happen? Oh! I have that here. Here you go! Will you marry me? That will be awesome. All okay? Come on, everybody. Yes, Sona. Where are you? - Please come home quickly. - I'm really busy today. I am going crazy. Roshan! He... Leave it, Sona. I want to meet you right now. I am out shopping now. - I'll call you when I'm free. Okay? - Don't hang up. I... It's an awesome plan. I never knew that you were so intelligent. We should rock it! I have made many such plans. We'll rock it! So, as we said! What would you like to have, Manju? Juice or tender coconut? Anything is fine. What about cold coffee? Cold coffee? Yeah! They serve cold coffee too! Come. Sit down. I'll go place the order. Brother! - Do you have cold coffee? - Yes. Give us two cups. Make it really cold. - Okay. - Over there. - How much does a half kg cake cost? - 420 Rupees. I've placed the order. - What else is happening? - I am doing good. What's happening with you, Manju? Oh! Water! What did you want to tell me, Asi? The water is so good, right? - We have met so that I can say what I want to say, right? - Hey! Last week, it was me. And this week? Who is this? No. I don't want to hear anything. You cheat! Idiot! It's okay. - I'll be right back. - What's all this? - It's nothing. Divya! Sorry... Deepa! Listen to me! Hi. Hi. Here? Here! Everything got messed up? What is it? Oh my God! Done! Superb, bro! Awesome, right? - What's all this? - Come! - Must be Christmas celebrations. - Great timing! What happened? Will you marry me? - Can I marry you? - What? Sorry. Not you. Will... you... marry me? Manju! Manju! - Where are you going? - To die! - To die? - Yes. - Where? This is not the plan. Where are the others? There's lot more to come. - Blast 1, Blast 2, Confetti... - Get lost! Wedding ring! Wait! Here you go. Let's go downstairs. What are you doing here? I came to meet someone. Where is your Harry Potter? What? Oh! That book? I threw it away. Why? Why should I carry it around? It would just be a burden. What's happening in your life? What? You don't know anything about my life, right? Shall I ask you something I know then? Did you trap anyone with your eyes? No. Why? Didn't find anyone? It's just that I am not married yet. I am engaged. Actually, it had been decided, before we met. The engagement was not so long ago. Hey! Didn't you think of me during your engagement? Just because we spoke for a while, should I be thinking only of you? Just like your book, that's also a burden, right? That's right. It's time for me to leave. I am leaving. Hey! Are you leaving? Let me talk! - Wait! Wait! Wait! What is this? - It flopped. Flopped? Who is she? You were all betraying me? Stop it! Stop it! You and your damn balloon! Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! Bye! If every family in Kerala had planted one tree each, that would have been a solution to this heat. We should be doing more such things, more than the Government. I mean, each individual. What's the point in talking about things that will never happen, Krishna? If we want our world to change according to our wish, we should say what we have to say! No one else is going to say what we have to say, right? Okay then. See you, dude! See you. If we want our world to change according to our wish, we should say what we have to say! No one else is going to say what we have to say, right? There's no such person here. No way. She must be this tall. She has big eyes. Her nose is really small. She is really fair. Do you really know the person? Of course! She's very close to me! But you don't know her name, neither do you have her phone number! Tell me the truth. Are you a skirt-chaser? What is this? If I was a skirt-chaser, I'll come looking for someone beautiful like you, right? Well, is she a nurse or a staff at this hospital? I'll tell you once again. She's this tall, has big eyes, small nose, a little arrogance. - Just a minute. Hello? Neo Hospital. Dr. Sujay? Doctor's consultation will be from 2 pm to 4 pm. You can call then. Thank you. Please give me two minutes. - No way! This is a labour room. It's a rule that doctors should not be disturbed inside the labour room. Okay. We don't have to disturb them. - I can go inside, right? - Men are not permitted inside the labour room. Isn't he a man? He's wife is admitted for delivery. This is much more serious than a delivery. You know, Dr. Nima? Her distant uncle is critically ill. - I had to tell her that. - He's not going to give birth, right? Wait over there. I'll tell you when Doctor becomes free. Go and sit there. I'll set you straight later. Giving me scary looks? Oh my God! Hello? Sudhiyetta! - Don't cry, dear. - I'm in too much pain, sister. Please call my husband. - Sister, here's the file. We've informed your husband. He will come now. Don't cry. Oh God! Sudhiyetta! Sudhiyetta! Oh my God! Meenukkutty, your Sudhiyettan is here. Sister, what are you waiting for? Take her inside quickly. - Who are you? Don't say anything. It's all my mistake. Didn't I tell you that we don't need this? - Meenukkutty! Meenukkutty! - Don't come in here. I want to come! No! All of them look the same, huh? My performance was in vain. Oh dear Meenukkutty! - Hey Nima. - What are you doing here? - I need to tell you something urgently. - Wait outside. Should I wait outside? - Do you need any help? - No. - Tea for you, Doctor. - Thank you. So... You were Dr. Nima Alex? You!! So that's why you were saying that the kidney is 2 inches below the heart, and that the oblongata is under the foot and all that. - Hey! Stop it! Okay. Oh yeah! Now I realized... ... why you felt extra cautious while seeing pregnant ladies. What do you want now? Well... I.... Will we meet again? Well, I know that we won't. For some time, can you come with me? I won't come. At least for the sake of that day? How ridiculous! I did something foolish that day. So? It hasn't ended yet? Just some time! It's my duty time. I have a lot of work. I will never come to meet you... or disturb you again. Can you come with me for some time now? Sorry. I can't! Hello? Stupid! How can she be so foolish? Where? At Lakeshore hospital? Okay. I will come now. Auto rickshaw! Follow that vehicle. Follow that scooter. Nima! I've come here for an emergency. Can you please wait here? - Do you need any help? - Just wait here. Sona! - What have you done? - What should I do then? Sona! - Did you come when I called you? - I was on duty. I have no one now. Shut up! How could you be this stupid? You keep quiet, Mom! You won't understand all this, Mom! Hey! Who are you? What are you doing here? Well, I came to this room. Why are you peeping in, then? Shall I call the security guard? No, I'll call my friend. Go ahead! Just a minute. - This aunty has a... - Huh? This sister has a doubt whether I came with you. - Is he with you? - Yes. Then stay inside. It's the time for the rounds. You can't be out in the corridor now. Thank you, sister. - You wait here. I'll be right back. - Okay, aunty. Bygones are bygones. Forget all that. Nima... How can he do this to me? - Sona, I.. - Oh! I lost the snake game. That's the sound. Sona! Forget it! Even you can't do anything for me, right? It's not like that. You have a good life already. Your family... Your mother is living for you, right? I don't want anyone. I don't want to live without him. Don't say that. What happened? Was it a suicide attempt? What method did you use? Shut up! Oh! You slashed your vein? That's what! Never use this method. 80% of the failed cases are such vein slashing cases. Next time, try to drink some acid, or burn yourself with petrol. And if you're still not dead, drink acid, burn yourself with petrol, and jump from the top of a huge building immediately. - You'll die. - Who are you to say all this? - I was just trying to help you. - Stop it. But if you want to die, you need to be really brave. You are brave! You can do it. Why do you want me to die? I'm not going to die. Are you sure? You won't do it again, right? Get out! - Well, I... - Go outside. - Get out! There are many more interesting methods. - If you keep your head on a railway track.. - Get going! Get lost, you dog. 'The Aunty Returns' Sister Aunty, see you! Oh my God! Hey! Don't cry. Please! Okay. I'll talk to Roshan. Will you really talk to him? I will talk. So... will you go alone? I'll go. You don't want to listen to what I say. And you want me to come with you to some place? Consider this as a favour. - Please. - I'm not considering it as a favour. I will come. You should also come. Where? Great! Okay. I will come. But I can't stay for a long time. I have night duty. This is Roshan's house. Is this a house? Oh God! Roshan's father is a car dealer, who's also into exports. Whatever it is, it's a fancy setup. No wonder that girl was crying. -Manjooran! -Don't talk nonsense. She was really serious about this relationship. He deserves to be slapped. Why don't you slap him then? I might have to do it, most probably. We have come here anyway, right? Let's go talk to him. You wait here. I'll go talk to him. Hey Nima! What a surprise! Roshan... - Sona... - Hey! What is this, Nima? All that is over, right? What else is happening? - Reshma, this is Dr. Nima. My friend. - Hi. We had a crack common friend. - Oh okay. - I met her through that girl. Okay then. Bye, Nima. Roshan.... About Sona... Just a minute. Paul! Sharath! Hey! This is... Sona's friend. Nima. Get some food for her. Come quickly. What? Should I hold your hand? - Wait! - Don't go! We're coming with you. Watch her! Hey! Ask your friend not to worry. So what if he's gone? We are here, right? Come on! Come on! That would be perfect. The two of you and the two of us. We'll sort everything out. Yes! But don't play a drama like her, after everything's over. Hey Paul! When did you reach? - We were here only. - You guys sit. - We'll be right back. - Okay. Okay. Come quickly, dude. - Some other guy is with her. - Let's leave quickly. Come! Can you handle so many people together, dear? Come, let's go back. Hi. Hi. I didn't recognize you. You didn't recognize me, you cruel man? You cheat! After tempting me saying that I have apple cheeks and parrot lips? - Who is he? - I don't know. You've forgotten everything, huh? We've spent so many nights together in my room. - On my bed! - Who are you? You fooled me calling me 'Sona' and now... Oh my God! Don't trust him, dear. He will cheat you too. I am sure. - Bloody pervert. - Who are you? What is this, Roshan? - I don't know. - Who is he? - I don't know! I swear! - So cheap! Reshma, listen to me! Hey! Hey! Come. Don't turn back! Don't let him go. Catch him! Come on! Quick! - Come on! - Start the bike! Come on, quick! - Hop on quickly! - Let's go! Catch him! Check if someone's following us. No! Don't make me laugh. If we had stayed there five minutes longer, that would have been the end of it! You made tall claims that you'll slap him and kill him, right? Well, when there's a crowd, I am scared to talk. But you were awesome! - You were too good. - You know that I am always... - That's enough. - This is nothing! Santa Claus, please forgive me! Shall I ask you something? Yes. What is your actual name? Harry. Harry? Harry Menon. Which Menon in this world would name his own son, Harry Menon? Richard Menon! I'll call you Harry. Okay. As you please. What's your actual story? The story behind this face... and this name? I won't say that. Tell me. A mother... and a son. A mother with so many desires. And a son who promised to fulfil all those desires. And finally, when everything was going well, due to this son's... carelessness.... An accident! A mother who departed with all those desires, and this son who was left alone with these desires. The story ends there. That's not how it is, Harry. Every child has elements of his or her father and mother. So... through this son, that mother will live on, fulfilling her desires. This story will end only after that. Happy Christmas! Happy Christmas! Happy Christmas! Happy Christmas! Love you all! Love you! So... where to, next? Somewhere. There's an awesome place. A place where we can shout out all the truths. Let's go there. Come! *** As this night fades *** *** As this flower withers *** Uh oh! Is it about to start? The play is not happening today. *** Where are you and where am I? *** *** We'll disappear for each other tomorrow *** *** We'll touch the depths of our lives with our silences *** *** Whatever we've seen in our eyes are disappearing like dreams *** *** Moments are scattered, never uniting *** *** Will these beautiful passing moments come back to my door? *** *** Will you come again on this path? *** *** On this path.... *** *** All the secrets you whisper to me will be memories tomorrow *** *** The desires we shared during these moments will disappear as the sun rises *** *** Unspoken words are trembling within *** *** Deep breaths are dampening my spirits *** *** The time and the wind have disappeared far away *** *** We are also disappearing far away, my dear friend *** *** We are also disappearing far away, my dear friend *** *** As this night fades *** *** As this flower withers *** *** Whatever we've seen in our eyes are disappearing like dreams *** *** Will these beautiful passing moments come back to my door? *** *** Will you come again on this path? *** *** On this path.... *** *** We are also disappearing far away, my dear friend *** - Hello? - What the hell is this? Arun, I had messaged you, right? What? That your friend tried to commit suicide? Is that more important than your patients? Well, Arun... - I... - Don't cook up any story now. You should reach the hospital within ten minutes. Okay. - Okay, Arun. - Don't make me stupid for choosing you. Are you crying? I tried a lot. But I am unable to... ... cry with a smile. Who was it? Would-be? Should-be? Could-be? Arun. What does he do? He's the Managing Director of my hospital. He's a big shot, huh? So, what now? You have to leave, right? Of course. Where should I drop you? I don't have any particular goals. I will go somewhere. You need to have a goal, Harry. You should have everything. Your home-town, your house, everything! Then you'll be perfect. I was perfect. Those few days I spent with you? And now, until this moment, I am perfect. Now, I'll be off without any roots. You need to have roots. Even if they are not strong. If you have roots, it will always be a strength. Are you sure? Yes. Then come with me. Come with me! Where to? Wherever it is, you won't have to cry with a smile. I don't want to go seeking happiness anywhere, Harry. Do you know the joy of us being the cause of happiness for people around us? I have known that... in every moment I spent with you. Don't lie to me. Where should I drop you? Am I the one who's lying? You are lying now. Look into my eyes and tell me... What do you want? Yes. I liked you. You know how long I waited, thinking that you'd call me? But who's going to read what was written on the book you threw away? Book? It was just a burden for you, right? When I was consoling myself thinking it was all stupid, you came again! What are you saying, Nima? I don't understand! You can come anytime, go anytime. And you can throw away those memories after that. And you can meet me again after that. But what you're giving me... ... is not happiness. It's just sorrow. Sorrow that I have to suffer, for my entire lifetime! Okay. Let's part ways. We won't meet again. Don't hit me. It was you at the mall yesterday, right? You were with him at the mall yesterday, right? I got thrown at with a timepiece, when I tried to solve the mess he created yesterday. - Where is he? - I don't know. I don't want to know. Goodbye. - Hi. - Hi. Wow! You've really changed! But when I became happy, you became moody. Oh! Didn't you see him yesterday? That legend who was with me? He doesn't know what to talk and where to talk! He hurt you a lot, right? You're wrong, Nima. Harry had come to meet me at the hospital again, yesterday. At the hospital? I didn't feel like leaving without coming here. Don't be angry at me. Sorry. Come, sit down. Roshan's cousin had called. He told me about everything that happened there. What? When he gave me a description, I knew who it was! Well, nothing like that. Anyway, the wedding is cancelled. Are you planning to get back with him? Me? Again? No way! You should fall in love! Do everything you like in life! See this world! But don't sacrifice anything for that. Family. You need that. Well... I.... Certain things... We'll realize their value only after losing them. You lie down. I was just boring you with my philosophy. Okay, then. Nima has told me everything. What do you know about Nima, Harry? I know her as well as I know me. That Nima... None of you know her! Shall I leave? Can you do me a favour? What? Just give this to her. He is crazy! He has no other job! He's just trying to stay happy without facing the reality of life. Is it wrong to stay happy in life, Nima? Okay, Sona. I'll call you in the evening. Nima! Don't miss such a person in your life. Let me eat this. No other shops are open since it's Christmas. Please tell me. -Get up. -Some more rice. You and your rice! - Isn't his name Harry? - It's something like that. We call each other 'Dude' in Kochi, so I call him that too. Where is the place? -I'm from Wayanad. But I'm in Kochi now. -Not yours. - Harry's place. - Harry? He.... I think it's somewhere in Palakkad. There's a Vijayarajan Master who gives us properties for our programmes. Stop there! Couldn't you catch that seat? Sorry. He's not a troublemaker. He said that he has studied engineering. Now he's roaming around, making sculptures and writing stuff. Here? He comes to me whenever he comes here in Kochi. This time it was really funny. Some girl ditched him some time back, in Ootty. So, he has been searching for that girl, for the past few months. He went to some old schools in Ootty, and found some addresses... Now he's searching all over India for that girl. He fooled him, big time! Anyway, he's head over heels in love with her. His house? House? He hasn't told me about his house. Whenever I asked him, he used to evade that question. I also never bothered then. Where would he be now? - This guy! - How do I find him? If you want to find him, go to China or Europe. He doesn't have to stay here. He's really talented. Why should he waste his life, searching for that girl? He can go somewhere and have a good life. - Any other details? - Some rice here, please! Do you know any other details? I don't know any other details. Rice, please! I don't know anything more. You may be able to know something from Palakkad. Palakkad! Okay then. Bye! See you. Thanks! - Asi.. - Yes! The girl whom Harry was searching for? That's me. - What are you looking for? - Soap! Oh! Soap! Get lost! What nonsense are you saying? I must take this decision. What if the guy you're searching for is a wastrel? A good for nothing guy? I am ready to take that risk. Nima, you'll be a failure. Like your father. Harry! Who is he? Is that even his name? I tried to give you a good future. Arun! What I wish for in my life... are some good memories. And not so many reminders! I am leaving. You can terminate me, if you want to. My dad used to say that even if we compromise in our careers, we should never compromise in our lives. I'm scared whether this decision might go wrong, Doctor. Even if that's the case, you can feel relieved thinking that, you at least made one decision for yourself. So... Two days leave, right? Yes. Now... even if you don't find him.... don't waste your life. Because, you have a very good future. No, Doctor. I won't do that. - One ticket to Palakkad. - Just one? Yes. There's a place where he stays when he comes here. Or else, it is Palakkad. Whatever you decide, that decision will be right. You can feel relieved thinking that, you at least made one decision for yourself. Vijayarajan Master? I'll call him. Master! Harry! There's someone like that. But he's not Harry. He's Hari. Hari Menon. He matches your descriptions. - Hari? - Yes. He brings some handicrafts here to sell them. He comes only once in a while. Where would he be now? It's been a while since he came here. Some of his stuff is still here. Let me search for his address. It should be here. Elson, Praveen, Hari. Got it! It's in Perinthalmanna. There's a landline number too. Hello? Harry? Isn't this Hari's house? Yes. Who is this? My name is Nima. Is Hari home? - He has left. - When will he come back? He's going to Malaysia today. Hey! Was Hari in Malaysia earlier? No. He was in Bangalore. When did he reach? Two days back. - What is it, dear? - Who is speaking? I am Hari's elder sister. I want to meet Hari. Do you have Hari's number? He hasn't taken his phone. I'll give you the driver's number. Just a second. Okay. Which airport has he gone to? Kozhikode. Who are you, dear? I am Hari's friend. Bye. Sigh! Brother! Calicut! Where in Calicut? Airport. Okay. - Please go fast. - Yes, Madam. Where is your house, dear? What happened, Madam? Do you have a headache? If you keep yapping, this will pierce your neck! I need to reach the airport quickly. We can go! The music! Hello? - Is Hari with you? - I've dropped Hari sir at the airport. He must have left in the flight by now. Who is this? Hello? Hello? It's the release of Rajinikanth's new film. And there's some temple festival happening here too. We've reached Ottappalam. I'll take you to Kozhikode in 1.5 hours, Madam. No. That's not necessary now. Drop me at the next town. I'll go back from there. We will never meet again. Ambika theatre? My house is in Ottappalam. Straight through the road opposite Ambika Movie Theatre. When you go straight, you can see a huge Banyan tree. You can see a ground near that tree, on the right side. If you look from my house, you can even see the procession from Poonchirakkavu temple. Which Menon in this world would name his son Harry Menon? Richard Menon! Must be a huge mansion, right? Yes. It's an old building. There will be many relatives there, right? Of course! My uncles, aunts and their children... All of us were together long back. But everyone should get back to the house for the temple festival. That's a must! And you have a huge mango tree in your courtyard, right? Yes! Don't you tie a swing on its branch? Wow! You know everything, huh? I know her! Nima, right? - Yes. - Just like how Harry described! I am Harry's aunt! Harry? Ajayetta, please come here. Look who's here! Recognized her? - Nima! - Nima? Yes. - Are you on your way, dear? - Yes. Have you come alone? Was it difficult to find the house? - No. - Where's my brother? - Call her inside. - Come inside, dear. Give that bag to me. Come, dear! Aunt! Aunt! Look who's here! Please sit down. Rametta! Brother! That's Harry's mother. Shobhachechi. His mother was everything to him! You have a friend to play with now, Ammu! You can play with her like you play with your brother, okay? Will you give her the swing? I will. Do you like her? - Yes. - We needn't let her go anywhere now. Let's ask her to stay here to play with you. Nima! I am Ramachandran. Harry's father. So, Richard Menon? That's me too. I was abroad for a while, in the U.K. It's a name I got from there. And I didn't let it go. When Shobha left us, I lost my Harry as well. Now... it's after so many years! All of us coming together... in this house, like this. For him. Thanks. Well, I... There's a lot of time left for that. Well... Where is he? Here? Here! This is my home town and my house! My everything! Am I perfect now? No. I never thought that... you would tell me the truth. Not to believe whatever I said, am I so bad? No. You were too good. Too good to be true. You were too good to be true. The words written within the bracket, have no connection with the paragraph, right? Grammatically, no. But with its meaning, it can even change our lives.
