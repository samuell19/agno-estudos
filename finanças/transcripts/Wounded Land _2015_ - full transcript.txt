A film by Erez Tadmor ﻿Wounded Land ﻿Faster, Mashiah, faster! ﻿You are losing him. ﻿Shore to 401, ﻿the suspects are near the containers. ﻿Turn right here, go in. ﻿Here. Stop! ﻿You're under arrest. You too. ﻿For what? - You'll find out soon enough. ﻿Come here. Don't move. ﻿What's the combination? - How should I know? It isn't mine. ﻿I saw you load things in, ﻿don't tell me "it isn't mine." ﻿I told you to open the container. ﻿Mashiah, forget it. ﻿I don't know what you're talking about. ﻿Go get the crowbar. ﻿Don't move. ﻿Shore to 401, ﻿Neumann says to hold everything until he gets there. ﻿Copy. ﻿Mashiah, stop it. ﻿Mashiah, stop it, I said. Enough! ﻿Okay, get in the patrol car. ﻿Bushari, take Mashiah to the station, ﻿I'm taking over now. ﻿Amar, stick around. ﻿The station? - Did you hear me? ﻿We caught them red-handed. ﻿Bravo. You'll get your medals later. Now get going, ﻿I'm not saying it again. ﻿Neumann, it's stolen goods. ﻿A mafia guy from the port brings it here and from here downtown. ﻿We've been watching them for days. ﻿That's exactly why I'm taking over. ﻿Now get going. It's not up for discussion. ﻿I demand that you keep me updated. ﻿Why, what'll you do? Tell your uncle on me? ﻿Mashiah, the day I have to report to you ﻿I'll know it's time to hand in my badge. ﻿That fucking Zloof, ﻿that nephew of his is like stinking gum on my shoe. ﻿Let them go. ﻿Are you sure you don't want me to check the container? ﻿I's all right. Leave it to me. ﻿You're a good guy, Amar. ﻿Take your friend and beat it ﻿so we can all go home and light Shabbat candles. ﻿Get Mashiah off my back. ﻿He's your responsibility? Deal with him. ﻿What's in the container? ﻿What if there's something in there, Yehuda? ﻿We'll talk about everything at Avner's. ﻿About what? Something that will take care of you. ﻿Don't you get it? ﻿No, no. ﻿No, Yehuda, ﻿that's not for me. ﻿I can't go there. ﻿You'll go and you'll do as I say. ﻿You deserve more, Kobi. You deserve a house. ﻿Look at your kids, look at my kids. ﻿Is that what you want? ﻿What if there's something in there, Yehuda? ﻿We'll talk about everything at Avner's. ﻿About what? Something that will take care of you. ﻿Don't you get it? ﻿No, no. ﻿No, Yehuda, ﻿that's not for me. I can't go there. ﻿You'll go and you'll do as I say. ﻿You deserve more, Kobi. You deserve... ﻿What the hell is this, a joke? ﻿It won't hold up in court, ﻿he doesn't say anything. ﻿What do you want him to say? ﻿He said he wants to meet Avner Cohen from the port. ﻿Why did you say no? ﻿You avoided it on purpose. ﻿I told you I'm not the man for the job. ﻿Find another way or forget it. ﻿Tzeiger, I told you, it's not so simple. ﻿They've worked together for years. ﻿Neumann hired him. - That's not the point. ﻿Their kids play together, ﻿|ust last week Neumann asked to promote him. ﻿I don't care about promotions and friendships. ﻿And Kobi, ﻿there's nothing to discuss, ﻿you'll record him tomorrow. ﻿He has three kids at home, ﻿I don't want to ruin his life. ﻿For what? ﻿We don't even know what's in there. ﻿Okay. You'll visit his new house tomorrow, ﻿act normal, no questions, no matter what he says. ﻿Ask to see Avner Cohen tomorrow. ﻿He'll take you there, ﻿you'll record the whole drive and the meeting. ﻿ ﻿And Kobi, don't screw up this time. ﻿Kobi. ﻿What a palace. ﻿A position's opening up in a few months, you'll get a promotion. ﻿Are you serious? ﻿I spoke to Zloof, he's for it. ﻿Don't worry, we'll get you out of your neighborhood eventually. ﻿Aviv, come here. ﻿Go, he's calling you. - Come here. ﻿Eyal, show us what they teach you at judo class. ﻿Yehuda, give them a break. ﻿They aren't cops, they're kids. Let them play. ﻿Do you want them to be like your brothers? ﻿Pencil-pushers who can't even hammer in a nail? ﻿Warm up for the competition. ﻿Go on. ﻿You're dead. - No fair! ﻿Did you see that, Dad? ﻿Did you see what he did? ﻿You're a liar and a cheat and you're not my friend any more. ﻿Hey, Aviv, calm down. ﻿It's just a game. ﻿But Dad, you saw what he did. ﻿Be a good loser. ﻿You see that? Nice going, ﻿soon he'll be working with us. ﻿Hello? ﻿Hi, Suha. Naim? ﻿What are you doing here? ﻿I want to see you. ﻿Naim, you know you're not allowed here. ﻿Come out, I want to see you. ﻿Come in. ﻿What are you doing here? - I'm going away. ﻿I came to see you before I go. ﻿Where are you going? ﻿What are you doing here? ﻿Leave him alone. ﻿What are you doing here? - Leave him! ﻿Go inside, beat it. ﻿Take her away! - I don't want to go! ﻿Go inside. - Suha. ﻿What are you doing here? ﻿Do you hear me? ﻿What are you doing here? ﻿You hear me? ﻿What do you want? ﻿Go back to your village and stay out of her life. ﻿Leave him alone! ﻿If I see you here again, you're fucked! ﻿Don't hit him! - Get inside! -Leave him alone! ﻿Leave him alone! ﻿Leave him alone! ﻿Stop it! Leave him alone! ﻿Leave him alone! ﻿Leave him... ﻿Go. ﻿You see what they do. ﻿Go. ﻿Maybe now that you've embarrassed him you'll take him to judo tonight? ﻿It couldn't hurt. ﻿Nurit, you make it sound like I play all day. ﻿I have a shift today. ﻿At least you taught the boy to cheat. ﻿Spend some time with him for a change. -Cut it out, ﻿I'm not your patient. ﻿You saw what Eyal did to me. ﻿Why didn't you say something? - Aviv, ﻿we discussed this, right? ﻿It's just a game. ﻿You saw me win. ﻿Admit it, I won. ﻿Enough already. ﻿Get up, sweetie. ﻿Give me your hand. ﻿Thats right, put your hand in. ﻿There we go. ﻿Why don't you take him to judo? ﻿You know I have a shift today. ﻿Neumann's on the way over. ﻿I'm going by myself. ﻿Come here, little rascal. ﻿Let's go. ﻿What's the matter? You look pale. ﻿Let's forget it. - What's the matter? ﻿I promised Aviv I'd make it for the end of the competition. ﻿Fucking idiot. ﻿The competition's over. ﻿Don't be a jerk, come on. ﻿What? ﻿Did you feel that blast? ﻿Sounds like downtown. ﻿Shore, this is 401. ﻿Shore here. ﻿Did you hear an explosion? - I'm checking it out. ﻿Shabak (Israel internal security) ﻿Here it comes. ﻿10 years old, chest wounds, tension. ﻿Another stretcher, you guys. ﻿Dr. Aharoni ﻿Doctor! ﻿Shore to 401, ﻿the suspect is in the fifth ambulance, arriving now. ﻿Copy. ﻿It's Ben Shushan. ﻿I need someone here. ﻿Pulse. ﻿We need bandages here. ﻿What's up? ﻿He's all yours, Neumann. - Thanks, Ben Shushan. ﻿How is he? - Well know more soon. ﻿Let's take him inside. ﻿We have another casualty here. ﻿Okay, take him inside, ﻿keep an eye on the drain until he's in surgery. ﻿Are you taking him? - Yes, and not a moment to lose. ﻿We have other victims, some badly wounded, ﻿we're at full capacity. ﻿Are you sure? - There's no time to argue. ﻿Folks, is everything okay? - Yes. -Let's go. ﻿I'm taking this to Dr. Bader. You aren't authorized to decide. ﻿I'm in charge of this shift. ﻿You could be treating another casualty. ﻿Bushari, Mashiah, stay with him. ﻿Kobi, stay with me. ﻿Listen up, ﻿keep an eye on that doctor, you hear me? ﻿Where did the Shabak go? ﻿They're coming back. I need you here. ﻿Got it, kid? - Sure. ﻿Hold on, where are you going? ﻿To HQ. You don't need me here. ﻿Take charge of Bushari and Mashiah. ﻿Mashiah? No, no. ﻿Give me someone else. ﻿No choice. Keep your eyes open. ﻿Piss in the IV for all I care, but stay here. ﻿I'm counting on you. ﻿And Amar, relax, it'll be okay. - Sure. ﻿Shore to 45, Neumann, get over to the station, quick. ﻿Be quiet over there. ﻿Open the door. ﻿Apparently this was a very big bomb, ﻿over 10 kg, I'd say, ﻿the bomb was very sophisticated, ﻿apparently with pieces of nails and... ﻿The lines are down, huh? ﻿Our assumption is that it was a suicide bomber. ﻿Can I get a doctor over here? ﻿Excuse me. ﻿I need a doctor here. ﻿Why don't you have a doctor here? ﻿Excuse me. ﻿Sir, I told you, your son is in line for surgery. ﻿You said that half an hour ago. ﻿Do you want him to get worse? ﻿Sir, you see how busy we are. We're doing our best. ﻿My son is lying there wounded. No one's helping him. ﻿I want you to get a doctor over here. ﻿Please be patient. ﻿You all know why we called you in, right? ﻿know it's inconvenient ﻿but that fucking terrorist decided to blow himself up on a Saturday ﻿so that's how it is. ﻿We don't know a thing, ﻿where he came from, if he was alone, ﻿who drove him, from where? ﻿It's all unclear. Okay? ﻿There may be another terrorist out there, ﻿the Shabak will update us. ﻿I'll divide you into areas. ﻿Lugasi, Haimon, you take the site of the bombing. ﻿Roshko, Aviram, ﻿I want you downtown, by the beach. ﻿Doctor. -Yes. ﻿I'm Kobi, ﻿these two officers and I will be guarding you tonight. ﻿Okay. ﻿He was x-rayed, he's badly wounded, ﻿he has shrapnel in his head. ﻿He needs surgery immediately. ﻿We need quiet here, don't let anyone in. ﻿Thank you. ﻿I'm not guarding a murderer or the collaborator who's treating him. ﻿Then he ran towards the restaurant, ﻿ran across the main street, was nearly hit by a bus, ﻿ran towards the Restaurant.. ﻿Don't you think I saw you text Neumann? -What? ﻿I thought I could trust you. ﻿We were this close from busting him ﻿I reported that we caught him. ﻿Is that a problem? - It sure is. ﻿The problem is, you don't see ﻿the trap they're setting for you, ﻿that's the problem. ﻿Listen, you two, these are our orders and we'll carry them out, ﻿like it or not. ﻿Is that clear? ﻿Is that clear, Mashiah? ﻿Losen up Kobi. - Shut up. ﻿You can go home. ﻿I'll find a replacement for you. ﻿Don't you realize there were weapons there? ﻿What weapons? ﻿What weapons? What did you see? ﻿We should've busted the lock. ﻿Then you didn't see anything. ﻿I don't want to hear a tweet from you. ﻿Stay at your posts until we hear from the Shabak. ﻿Don't budge. ﻿It's the terrorist. Turn it up. ﻿On a busy street in Haifa ﻿no one notices the young terrorist carrying a big backpack. ﻿Here, this is the terrorist ﻿approaching the crosswalk, coming straight from Wadi Nisnas... ﻿Okay, folks... ﻿Time is short. Keep it brief. ﻿Why did you call Dr. Suleiman to this meeting? ﻿The man is critically wounded. ﻿The terrorist needs surgery immediately. ﻿Maybe. ﻿But there are other cases just as bad. ﻿I'm talking about bad judgment. ﻿You're bringing your prejudice into our decisions. ﻿I's not my prejudice. ﻿Dr. Suleiman is guilty of bad judgment. ﻿That's for me to decide. ﻿Dr. Suleiman, you can go back. ﻿And from now on talk to me first. ﻿Why don't you be a man about it and tell it to my face? ﻿I won't give you the pleasure of calling me a racist again. ﻿It's got nothing to do with that. ﻿my name were Dr. Cohen would we be here? ﻿You're like all the mob ﻿that yells "Death to the Arabs" when there's a terrorist attack. ﻿Don't call me mob. - Cut it out! ﻿Enough, ﻿everyone go to your operating rooms. ﻿immediately ﻿So who stuck us here? - The Shabak. -Shabak? ﻿Bullshit. So where are they? - They'll be here soon. ﻿You're as naive as a little girl, Amar. ﻿If they cared they'd be here. ﻿He's a dead man. ﻿He's right, Kobi, ﻿nobody cares besides us. ﻿Shore to 401, do you copy? ﻿Copy. ﻿Switch to channel 3. ﻿What's up? ﻿Your wife wants you to call. ﻿-Roger. ﻿For the viewers just tuning in, ﻿we've interrupted today's regular programming ﻿for a special report on the bombing in Haifa. We may now announce that the terrorist was mortally wounded ﻿and rushed to Rambam Hospital where he's being treated. ﻿Most of the casualties were taken to Rambam Hospital ﻿as well as ﻿the terrorist who is in critical condition ﻿and is being operated 'as we speak. ﻿Additional medical teams have been called ﻿in to Carmel and Yafe Nof Hospitals ﻿and are now on their way. ﻿We have no accurate information on the number of casualties. ﻿Excuse me. ﻿Excuse me, sir, I have surgery to perform. ﻿Excuse me, sir, ﻿move. ﻿Doctor, ﻿can you please take a look at my son? ﻿I'm sorry, I have an emergency here, ﻿an urgent operation. ﻿I understand. Please, just for a second. ﻿Sir, ﻿I can't. ﻿As soon as someone's available I'll send him over. ﻿I apologize. ﻿Come look, we've been here for a while, and... ﻿no one is helping us. ﻿And I think he's getting worse. ﻿Come, ﻿look at him. ﻿Look at him. ﻿Doctor. ﻿Look at him. ﻿Is he a doctor or what? ﻿Doctor, look at him. ﻿Just a quick look, Doctor. ﻿Please, just look at him. - I'm sorry. ﻿Look at him! ﻿Leave him alone! ﻿Mashiah, Avi, come here, ﻿quick. ﻿Hey, leave him alone! ﻿Leave the doctor alone! ﻿Sir, leave the doctor alone! ﻿What are you doing?! ﻿Folks, leave the doctor alone! ﻿Let go! -What are you doing? Let him go! ﻿Hey! -Let go! - Leave the doctor alone! ﻿Bushari Take him. ﻿Everyone step back. The doctor's going back to surgery. ﻿Stay away and calm down. ﻿When will my son get treated? ﻿When? Answer me. I want to see a doctor. ﻿Calm down. - Don't tell me to calm down. ﻿My son's been lying here for two hours ﻿waiting for surgery ﻿and you're taking care of that bastard? ﻿More doctors are coming. Be patient. ﻿Aren't you ashamed of yourself? ﻿Calm down, sir. - Look at me. Aren't you ashamed? ﻿Calm down. - You're supposed to be cops. ﻿What are you doing? He's a terrorist. -Fine. ﻿He's an animal. Why are you helping him? ﻿Move, move. ﻿You disgusting traitors. ﻿Why are you helping him? ﻿Move. Calm down. ﻿Mashiah, leave him, ﻿eave him alone. ﻿Move. ﻿Go back to your seat and calm down, you hear me? ﻿This time it happened in Haifa, ﻿7 dead, dozens wounded... ﻿Are you all right? ﻿Yes. ﻿There's trouble at the hospital. ﻿Those media idiots, ﻿they said the terrorist is in the hospital. ﻿Shore to 401. Kobi, do you copy? ﻿Copy, Neumann. ﻿I hear there's been an incident there. Everything okay? ﻿Postive Everything's under control, ﻿the casualty is in surgery. ﻿Need reinforcements? - Negative, everything's under control. ﻿I'll send more men later. ﻿Make sure the terrorist is safe. ﻿Is that clear? - Copy. ﻿If anyone dares raise his hand against a doctor again ﻿I'll make sure he spends a year in jail. ﻿No more Mr. Nice Guy, ﻿there's a law around here. ﻿You're talking about the law? ﻿We're stuck here like dogs ﻿and you're taking care of that shit. ﻿No one will beat a doctor. ﻿Let them do their job quietly ﻿and let us do our job. ﻿Everyone will be taken care of, I promise. Be patient. ﻿Kobi. ﻿Is Aviv here? ﻿What? Why would he be here? ﻿I don't know, he didn't come home. ﻿He didn't come home? ﻿What happened? - Nothing. ﻿Judo ended a while ago. - But he didn't come home. ﻿Who was he with? Eyal? - No, they had a fight. ﻿Could they have been there? - Don't be ridiculous. ﻿The bombing happened downtown. ﻿Did you call his friends? -I tried 100 times. The lines are down. -Right. ﻿I tried Tamir but he didn't go to judo. ﻿He must be at a friend's house, getting back at me. ﻿You should be there when he comes home. ﻿When are you coming? ﻿I don't know. Look at this mess. ﻿Kobi. -This is no place for the baby. Go home, it's all right. ﻿I'll walk you out. - Come, we're going. ﻿Daddy. ﻿Go with Mommy. - Give me your hand. ﻿I'll find him, don't worry. ﻿Come soon. ﻿Oops. ﻿Say bye-bye. ﻿-401 to Shore. -Shore here. ﻿Call me back on 3. ﻿401 from Shore, do you copy? - Kobi. ﻿Listen, Shira, my son Aviv ﻿didn't come home from judo.

Come here. Stay here. ﻿It's an ambush, don't you get it? ﻿If we go out they'll come in here. ﻿He's right, Mashiah. We can't split up. ﻿Are you crazy? Do you want to get killed? ﻿Call in reinforcements. - We don't need reinforcements. ﻿Doctor, all the police are outside now. ﻿We have to get him out of here. ﻿Otherwise they'll lynch him and all of us too. ﻿Okay. Any ideas? ﻿Orit, give him oxygen, I'll be right there. -Okay. ﻿Floor minus 3 ﻿Wait a sec. ﻿I can't believe those bastards, ﻿they're beasts. ﻿Hey, Avner, what are you doing? ﻿No entry.

I won't touch anything, I swear. ﻿No one enters without permission. ﻿Lugasi, go see if Forensics needs you. ﻿What's so urgent, Avner? ﻿The bomb blew off the storeroom door, ﻿I have to check it out. ﻿Come on. ﻿Close it. ﻿Thank God he didn't blow himself up near the storeroom. ﻿The whole building would have been blown to hell. ﻿As soon as the cops leave, ﻿pack everything up fast ﻿and move it to the other storeroom. ﻿Okay? Everything in place? ﻿The lines are up. ﻿Iris, is Aviv at your house? ﻿No, he doesn't answer. ﻿What? No, no need. ﻿He probably forgot to tell us, that's all. ﻿Yes, ﻿okay, thanks.
