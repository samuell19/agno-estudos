Please stand behind the yellow line. ...and to Gianni Minervini She's even smoking a cigarette, Gennaro. How'd I do? I'm Maria Serra, daughter of Mario Serra and Alba Veneruso. I was born on July 1, 1977. Dad died six weeks before from a gunshot to the head. He passed on without realizing what the fuck was happening. I was conceived in Germany. In Germany, on their honeymoon at my aunt's house. My mom was 20, they'd married in September and had recently moved to Milan. But she struggled to adapt. She spent most of the day cooking and calling Naples. Maria Serra! The job tryout didn't go well. - What do you mean? - You were too slow. - There was tons of trash. - But the others... - Plastic, paper, leaves. - But the others... - Where do leaves go? - In the bags. Don't worry, you're a pretty girl, you'll find work. A HOLE IN THE HEAD ODYSSEYS Next stop is Torre del Greco. Hi, mom. I tried out for a job as a street-sweeper. They said I'm too pretty for that job. Charm's family is finally reunited again. Enzo's not coming by? Later. Iaia is becoming a strong lioness. She learned to stalk her prey... You saw my mom... She started working for Gaetano Paudice, he owns the deli on Via Vittorio Veneto, 25, that's always packed. To supplement her retirement check. She makes savory pies with greens, cheese breads. But she doesn't bake them, how can she? She gets up in the morning, showers, grooms, and starts. Flour, yeast, water, eggs, flour, yeast, water, eggs. Knead, mix, mix, knead, knead, mix... all day long, understand?! And at night she conks out in front of dad. Two coffees, please. JEWELRY ARTS VOCATIONAL SCHOOL This is a state-recognized school, I'm the assistant to Luongo, a metal caster who used to row with dad. I work without pay, it's just to beef up my CV for the next competitive exam. - Morning, miss. - Morning, Aldo. Luongo arrived early, they're inside. - Thanks. - Have a good day. We know this kind of coral cannot grow at that depth. It's well over 50 meters at least, and in order to... Hi, Ciro. ...professional scuba divers go down to those extreme depths to fish it. "Fish" isn't the exact term, they gather it with a pick. The diver goes down, selects the piece, and puts it in a basket. Coral is a small polyp that grows on these structures. See... This isn't coral, it's the home where the polyp lives. When they say coral reflects the health of the seas, they're right. We'll work with Mediterranean coral which is red and small, not big like the one you saw in the museum. That's Asian coral. You've all seen red coral, but it can be white, pink, orange, red, and deep red. - How about you, Ciro? - Almost done, a few more touches. I recall there were things that my mind as a child couldn't understand. When they talked about my dad they'd say he was this... and that... They always said the same things. But I didn't understand. I just recall that I felt like... a deer in the headlights. Once in a while... I still feel that way often... as if this deer... Where's Maria? Alba? Where did Maria go? To Naples? How does she get there? By train or metro? When I have to go to Naples, I drive. What a waste! Gas, parking, the potholes bust my tires, the window-washers. Not to mention all the traffic, what a headache! And then they talk about pollution. No kidding! Pollution... Sweet Lord, isn't my brother handsome? Look at him! He looks great, so young and supple. Whenever he sees fresh roses he says: "A breath of fresh air!" How did Maria's tryout go for the street sweeping job? Did they hire her? They didn't hire her... All the better. Yeah, because she wants to be a teacher. Right? So that's what she should do. Maria Serra. Guido... Mandelli. - Was the train late? - No. Oh, I see... I thought... Sorry to keep you waiting. It's fine, no problem... Shall we go, or... I ordered two coffees. Two? No problem, some other time, if you want to... As you wish. Well, uh... ..Who knows, he's the one who left her. He left her. They break up and get back together nonstop. She should leave, the hell with it. What's that? Is the train coming? Dunno. Ever been here? I don't think so. Of all places, this is where you find the best hash? You bet, sweetie. What's with the dog? - He can't come inside. - Why? I'll hold him. Treat him well. Go in there. - Morning. - Hello. Ettore's not here? No, I am. Where is he? I need to measure his pressure and give him meds. He lets Paco come in. - The dog? - Yes. Well, when I'm here I make the rules. - Is she with you? - Yes. - Did Ettore give you her price? - I'm up to speed. You, go in there. Go. Move it. Now. I didn't come here for this. Got the money? Otherwise get lost. It's called "Children of a Lesser Bronx", by a Neapolitan who was also an actor and cabaret performer before anyone in Italy even knew what cabaret was. He still writes books and is an actor. This book was written in 1993. They are stories we can relate to. Maybe we'll invite him to come help us with our show. - The name? - I just told you. - "Children of a Lesser Bronx". - I mean the writer. Oh, Peppe Lanzetta! What's it about? There are 20 stories that relate to us, me, you, your mom, your dad... - Nice. - And our neighborhood. I'd rather forget about my 'hood! - Is it about the camorra too? - Yes. You drain me. Why do we have to do this one? Let's do something else. First of all... We don't "have to do" anything, we're not obliged. We should do things that interest us so we can experiment. We're not interested. No way, camorra stuff gives me hives. I can understand your point, but before... But before we start a debate, can we please read it? What a drag, professor! I like singing! You like singing... Why don't we have a talent show? - A talent show? - Yeah, right. Listen... What I'm saying... If you all talk at once, we'll get nowhere. I'd rather sing or dance... - A talent show. - We like dancing, singing, acting. Not heavy stuff about the camorra. - I like singing, too. - Guys... School is the last thing on their mind. They've practically erased it from their memory. It's like... they were taught it serves no fucking purpose. So me and the other teachers have kind of become... a last resort. We have to bust balls, Maria. We have to try to shake things up. You work at the outreach center, too? Yes. How is that? Well... it's a way to not get slapped around. Actually, we realized we can be the ones doing the slapping and we're better at it. You should come. - Me? - Yeah. No! Fabio, I'm a pacifist. Understand that? Look at me. Why not find a normal job? You have a degree. Answer me. Are you pulling my leg? No, but why is a guy like you wasting his time this way? What are you saying, Maria? Are you trying to piss me off, too? Why don't we talk about you instead of me? I lack substance. You're incredible. When I'm with you, I feel... incapable. Relax, I'm the incapable one. I want to help you. What's so funny? What can I do to help you? Find yourself a nice girl with a head on her shoulders. I'm a plant, but I don't grow flowers or leaves. Motherfucker! 30 minutes ago near my house on Via Franco Ricci, 42. He came from behind. Could you take a look at these? - I didn't see his face. - Just in case. Nope. Don't worry, it's just procedure, we had to try. Can I go? - I'll accompany you. - No. No offense meant, but I must say... your eyes are very penetrating. Goodnight. Goodnight. Will you tidy up after? I'm tired. You could work less, you know. Why bother? You never rest, not even on Sunday. I could use some fucking cheerfulness around here. Like I've always said: you never crack a smile. Hi, dad. - Morning, Salvatore. - Morning. Can I have a pizza? I'm wasting time with this chain, it's stuck. I need some lubricant spray. Hello, Aldo! Hello! Are you going to the beach? Be careful, the weather is iffy. Have a good day. What the fuck do you want? - Who gave you that? - I found it. Gimme it. - Nothing's missing. - How do you know? - I know everything. - You know you're an asshole? - Can I visit you at the school? - No! I don't want to see your face again. Still here? Get the fuck out of here. Fuck off, got it? Fuck off! We can go. Hold on... You live around here? - You must have a great view. - I face the other side. You see the Vesuvius? - Until it's gone. - Need a hand? Danilo De Chiara. - Maria. - Maria Serra. Is this Via De Amicis? It doesn't look like Via De Amicis. How about that coffee? Coffee? Where are we going? This isn't Via De Amicis. No, it's Via Botticelli. - I don't understand. - You see... Maybe I'm out of line, but I live here. Unbelievable. Hold on, wait here, please. - Are you coming up for coffee? - No. Never mind. Why not? It's my fault for assuming that... But I made coffee. - I know. - Come up. No, forget the coffee. Talk to you later. - Okay, bye. - Bye. I wanted coffee. I love my mother, but hate her at times. I want to leave. She never talks about dad. It's taboo. I have to defend myself. But... the door is closed... I feel hot and sweat buckets. Then I'm freezing and shaking... but can't do anything. I have to be careful to not become like her. Want to talk about Milan? Why not summon up the courage and go there? Why should I go? To go and meet... Mandelli, maybe. He served his sentence. Mom got a life sentence. I didn't see you come in. Let me go wash my hands. But don't leave, wait. Is it my eyes, or have you gotten prettier? Come in. I won't bite. Don't play shy. I'll just wash my hands. You're acting like an outsider. Are you scared? Come on. I was thinking of you this morning. Maria! Come here. You know I care about you. Why did you stop coming around? You got rich? You bet, can't you tell? Sure can, don't worry. - I know you're always grumpy. - And you? Lello and Ester? Haven't seen them in ages. Because you never come around, you vanished. Right. Because you're all crippled. It's been a year since we've seen you. I even went to make up with Alba. We made up thanks to you. She looks good after all these years. I didn't know she started baking. She said you wanted to talk to me. I wanted to talk to you... actually, I wanted to see you. You're working all alone now? Can't you see? I even fired Cesare after 25 years. 25 years. Can you do me a favor? Photograph my workshop. I want to sell it, I'm fed up. You just vanished, you never answer your phone. I went to Alba's to find you. You know that was hard for me. She told me you still work in that school for free. Need money? Maria, I raised you. You know... I can't be without you. My life sucks. There it is. How many years has it been here? 10, 12... What's the point? Like he surrendered before we did. Hands up! Right in front of the mountain, which isn't visible today, it's hiding. Lately, it's been hiding a lot. He seems like an outsider, too. What did that Neapolitan writer say, what's his name? People from Torre del Greco are in between the mountain and sea. He said... "If the Vesuvius doesn't incinerate you, you'll all end up fish food. Maria? Where are you? Come to my school. Hear me? We started rehearsing for the show. Good! He shut off all the lights and even stole your hopes. He doesn't listen when you talk, he never compliments you, he never gives you gifts because he's too rough. He chases skirts, he's a louse. But I love that man You're always sloppy, he's always dapper. I don't want to lose him You won't listen to reason, you fool. I love him deeply Morally he killed you, he's heartless. I don't want to shut myself off Fool, what are you waiting for? Leave him He's a rotten man He's with that other woman I forgive him. But then he'll be knocking on your door He'll come, make love, and leave He'll rush off because he's busy Go out and waste your breath calling him Good job! Good job! Good job! Sounds like you're torturing a cat! Quit clapping. Shut up, asshole. Who do you think you are? I'll show you a real singer. Okay. All right. Now we'll discuss Letizia and Deborah's performance. That asshole always criticizes. Criticism helps us improve. He's just a ball buster. It joins us together. It creates dialogue, improvements. Criticism is meant to be said and heard. In a different way, of course. And I think Dionisio has forgotten it's Salvatore's turn. I want to go first. All I can say is their song sucked. Guys... I'm here. Let me handle things. Nobody is the boss, nobody bosses anyone around. But let me handle things. Stay calm. No need to rush. Chill out, here's what we'll do: Dionisio will explain why he didn't like the song the girls just sang. - Now explain yourself well. - I ain't good at talkin'. Just let me rap and show them how it's done. Let's all calm down. Professor, we're not calm because he's acting high and mighty. - We're all equal. - Can we just stay calm? Good. I will ask you questions about the performance, and you'll answer. Is this an exam? Hell no. Just lemme rap. No, it's Salvatore's turn, I already told you. We have a lineup. And after every performance... Indeed. I don't want to discuss or correct, I just want to sing. I have a track, I don't need no damn bagpipes. Fine, you don't need bagpipes. But you still can't do it, we have rules to follow. You'll sing when it's your turn tomorrow. - Fuck you, professor. - No, fuck you... You and everyone like you. In here, let this be clear to everyone, there are rules that must be respected. If you don't respect them, then you can fuck off. We don't need people like you here. Quit trying to stare me down, I'm not like the other professors who... Fabio! Fabio! Let go, you'll kill him. Fabio, let go! Sorry. But sometimes, reacting is the 11th commandment. And you like fighting. You... I didn't fight. That kid is full of himself, he's a troublemaker. Know what the problem is? I took the bait like a dumbass. But you'll see, this episode will be good for us both. He picked a good song. He'll do it well. Who knew you were so violent? Me? You grabbed his neck and slammed him against the wall! True... I lose control sometimes. Know who his father is? Carmine Montuori. The guy who was killed two years ago in Poggioreale Jail. The camorra boss. He was known as "The Monkey". What's on his mind? - If his family finds out? - I don't know what got into him. Him? Fine, and me too. It's mainly my fault, but what can I do? Did you know the dead guy on the beach? He was from Portici, too. Alberto De Falco, did you know him? No, please... I don't want to talk about Alberto De Falco. Want to kiss me? Really? Want to fuck me? 200 euros. What'll it be? No. What the fuck do you want then? The Libyan Crisis: final press conference is underway in Berlin. We have breaking news... Their names are Father Antonio, Father Ciro. And Father Fabrizio... he's quite the man! He's a yapper, people listen to him when he talks. He's easy on the eyes... And that's important, too. You know? Even for a priest. If you're easy on the eyes... it's a good thing. That pill... When I go to mass tomorrow, I'll see what happens. That cigarette... Maria! You need to eat something. Pills and cigarettes. Eat! Know who you're like, Maria? Like Saint Catherine. Saint Catherine didn't eat either. All she ate was bread and raw vegetables. See? I'm becoming like Saint Catherine. Happy? She only ate pomegranates. Your jacket is torn. I forgot the spoons. For the sugar. Thanks. Would you like a glass of water? Hold on. Water first, right? A sip, yes. Do you drink lots of coffee? When I'm nervous. You know... we're not used to this. Thanks. Hope the coffee isn't cold. Who can that be? Excuse me. - Hi. - Hi, you have company? Be right back. This is my home... our home. It's a bit of a mess because I just got here. - Sorry for barging in. - Nonsense! I'm glad you're here. It was nice of him. Yes... I'm pleased to meet you, too. Guido told me about you. About me? About your meeting. Can I ask if... When... When? More coffee? Titti! Hi. Your school is in such a great location! - Hope they don't throw us out. - Why would they? Problems with the landlord, they don't want us here anymore. How are you? How do I look? Wonderful. I like your hat. So, what's up? I'm pregnant. Pregnant? I have human chorionic gonadotropin in my blood. Understand? That's great! Sure, real great... - Wow, you of all people! - Me... Because I'm a dickhead! Who's the father? Forget him, this is my problem. - So we're keeping it? - Sure... So I'll be disowned forever. Then get a voluntary termination. Is that what it's called? Sure, as if it were that easy. Don't you know how it works? Bureaucracy, clinics, psychological tests, sociological evaluations... Then hope to find a doctor who's not a conscientious objector. They build a wall around you and you're stuck. So you'll keep it? Are you nuts? I'll go see a doctor in Naples, Ettore's friend. I'll go with you. Last night I was thinking about keeping the baby. I was thinking about how... this thing lives inside of you, every night, and every day... and feeds from your body, drinks your milk. And then it comes out and you say: "Hello! Welcome!" - Amazing. - Imagine? Amazing. I don't know if I could do it. Pregnant woman are beautiful. I would put on airs. With a baby you can play again, you could be... a dog! Or... a cat! Act like a dolphin, a parrot. Maria! Maria! Maria! I'd pretend to be a swallow. A swallow. I'd call him Antonio. I haven't picked a girl's name. I think Lucky is nice. I like that, we all need luck. And you? Wouldn't you like to have a baby? Are you nuts? I don't even have a boyfriend. Because you're a fool. I'm withdrawn. Isn't this whipped cream good? We needed it. Yeah. It's sweet. Delicious. Let's go to the market. Okay, we'll buy some stuff. Something nice. Titti! Want to get married? Me and you? Yes, I do. I've missed out on so much. We decided to join the rally too, and then head to Piazza Duomo. Our Workers Autonomy Group veered toward the jail to go lend support to our lawyers who'd been arrested. I recall the police, armed to the teeth, were in front of the jail, but nothing happened, there were no provocations. We caught up with the rally, they were marching peacefully, our Workers Autonomy Group was responsible for flanking them. When we came back here, at the intersection with Via Olona, we stopped. Right there. And we saw the police coming from that direction. They were coming toward us but suddenly stopped there... - See the pharmacy? - The pharmacy. They stopped there. And so... at the intersection we stopped a bus and we hid behind and started throwing everything, anything we found: bottles, rocks. Memeo got scared, pulled out his .22 and started shooting. I nearly got shot because I was further ahead, hiding behind the cars, all hell broke loose, it was like war... like war... Got a light? I don't smoke. You look younger in plain clothes. You've rejuvenated me. Where are we going? - Away from this world. - But I like this world. - I guess it's not so bad. - It's not. - Though everything sucks. - No, why? - For example, you're a cop. - Yes. How do you feel about the femicide victims? Dunno. Gosh, I'm depressing you, huh? Let's go to the coast and turn on some music. Yessir! Leave it, I like this. Know it? Sure do. I love it. That asshole is here again? - What do you want? - I was waiting for you. To mug me again? I'll make you run. I told you before I didn't do it, are you deaf? You think I'll run? Think I'm afraid? You still piss your bed. Can we talk? You want to talk? It's late, I'm tired. Your dad was a cop, right? He got killed? Mine was in the camorra. He got killed in jail. Nothing to say? Your mind must be on something else. The professor. He's not better than me. Know what he did? What did I do to you? I'm fucking sick of Moderup, enough of this crap! Fuck you all. All set, don't worry. Go rest... Come on. Okay? - Titti. - Your friend's here. How are you? I'm cold. I'll handle it. Come sit. Damn it. Come sit. Sit down slowly. I had a 7.65 and... with all the smoke, I couldn't see. The distance was... considerable. We kept distant and spread out. Some didn't even take cover, like Memeo, he was in the middle of the road. Others were also there, fearlessly facing the police. I was the closest to them. I waited and then... I shot twice... maybe three times... They said dad fell quickly. He fell here. He fell here! Everything okay? Hey, Fabio... why didn't you ever ask to fuck me? Actually, I did... No, when? You expected me to ask: "Maria, want to fuck me?" Why not? You're not a kid. Can I ask you something? - Can I ask you something? - No, I'll ask you! Why would you, of all people, pretend to court me? Or are you really courting me? Want to play "man in love"? Be sincere, at least. When I was 11, there was a guy who said he loved me. He was sweet with me, affectionate. He forced himself on me. He was a family friend. So now, affection... makes me sick, it makes me puke. So either come and pay me to fuck, or what can I say? You can fuck off, too. Maria! I'll come... and pay you to fuck. - Not now, I need to go shopping. - I'll come along. I have to see my shrink after. You see a shrink? - When will you be done? - Dunno, I'll call you when I'm done. Don't forget. - I'll be waiting. - Sure. - Morning. - Hello. Fabio Violante, age 35, resident of Castellammare di Stabia, Via Cannavale, 14? That's me, why? Please come to the station with us. Mom! Mom! Damn it. Lina? Lina? - Sorry. - What's wrong? Mom isn't opening the door, is Ettore here? No, he went running. - Can I come in? - Want to hop over the balcony? Be careful! Mom! Mom! Where is she? Where are you? The Red Brigades are outside... waiting for my daughter... so she ends up like her father. Mom, I'm your daughter. There's nobody outside. They're gone. They're gone. They're gone. They're gone, mom. I never wanted to come to Milan, now here I am eating squid. Life is strange. "Life starts after the curve" my mom says, but... - Your mom? - She sends her best. She lives alone? With me. She knows you came to Milan? She didn't want me to. But now I can... I can look you in the face. So can I... Listen, I was born in a home with three rooms and a hall. And I still live there. When I was a kid, in every room, every single room, even in the entryway, bathroom, hallway, kitchen, there was one picture... of a handsome guy smiling. As soon as I learned to talk, I asked about him, who he was. When I was older I found out the truth, And I... was afraid to know what had happened. I felt hate for the man who took him away before I was born. "I'll kill him with my own hands one day", I thought, amidst that smell of wilted roses in front of his pictures. That was the smell of my home, and it still is... identical. And I'm still the same. What does your body feel? For example, right now it's somewhere else. When I don't eat... I don't eat anymore. Or I eat all the time. But it's useless because... there's no future, there never has been. There's a road, there are a lot of streets. I often look at streets online, but mainly... I look at that street in Milan. I'm thinking you're right. I should go. I have to go. It'd be best. Fabio, it's Maria. I wanted to talk, I sent you a message too. Know where I'm calling you from? I'm leaving the office of Dr. Mayer, my shrink. You should come here, too. I need to talk to you urgently, call me. Dang. The cop... Fabio, will you pick up? I sent you a bunch of messages. I just finished with Dr. Mayer, my shrink. Are we meeting or not? I was looking forward to it. Fuck you, call me. When will you grow up? You know... you know... what a shitty path I've taken and now I have to relive all of that stuff. The comeback... Not a single person, nobody reacts. Where are you guys? What are you doing? The Sardines Movement? Good motives? Good manners, good intentions. And then? Wake up! Everything's crumbling. And you don't notice a fucking thing! Maybe... you like lowering your pants. Then go right ahead. But... we already knew it, we knew it since Saturday, no actually, since Sunday. I told you. Didn't I tell you? Dad, enough! Enough with "I told you"! How dare you! How dare you give me advice?! Because you would've understood everything by now? It's a bit late. No? Know what you are? Do you? I'll tell you. You're the past, you're gone, dad. You're the past, the past buried in your comrades' heads, in your head! So... if you want to give me 30.000 euros, do it. Otherwise... Look at me! You'll never see this face again. Is it closed? No, some thieves broke in last night. Come in. Look, they stole and busted everything. They broke everything they could. This wasn't a regular robbery. They did this out of spite. Miss, this city has become a cesspool. Not even Jesus Christ is safe on his cross. You know... they shouldn't even step foot in here, they should burn. You saw them... - When did it happen? - Last night. Why do these people do this? I feel responsible. Why do this? I don't understand these people. What the fuck did they do here? What bastards! Look at the fucking mess they made in here! Shitheads! Sickening! - See the mess they made? - Look. - Lock them up! - What a mess. No! Unbelievable. You call this normal behavior? Look! Bastards! Mother-of-pearl all over the floor. How will we fix this? "We are... stronger than you" The troubles keep pouring in. You don't feel well? No, I'm fine. Fabio isn't. Fabio who? He won't answer my calls. I sent him a thousand messages. He was arrested. Arrested? - He's in jail. - Quit joking around. Where's Fabio? I told you: he was arrested for murder. What the fuck? What murder? De Falco. - Who told you? - Everyone is talking about it. Sweet Lord! Titti, say it again because I am losing my mind. Maria, I know this is hard, I understand... No, you don't! Fabio and I were supposed to meet up, we had plans. He didn't seem to be troubled. Hold on. Wait. Let me call that asshole. And do you think that Fabio is capable of killing someone? Want to know what I think? They should build a monument to the people who get rid of these fucking fascists. We were the product of the contradiction of this society. And the violence was the loss of innocence. My life stopped that day. Oh yeah? Well, mine stopped before I was born. I want to show you something. Something you know well. Is this you? No, that's Giuseppe Memeo. I was further ahead behind a car. This is my dad. Newly married. Did you ever see a picture of him? You look like him. Know what I've always wondered? Two things. First... if they had given dad permission to stay home with his wife who was 7 months pregnant and unwell, my life would've been better. And maybe... yours too. And the second thing... you need to answer this. Tell me... why did you have guns at a protest? Why the fuck would you bring guns to a protest? Huh? It's hard to explain, back then the mood was different. The fucking mood... You fired shots. - Shots! - Yes, we fired shots. But living in this city was like being in the epicenter of a warzone. You may think it's ridiculous and you might be right, but... I had never... never picked up a gun before. Never. We fought for fair book prices, for electricity in poor neighborhoods, for squatters in empty homes. When I think about it now, I see an 18-year-old who dreamt of a better world. Because what had been passed down to us made us sick. There were bombs, and massacres were taking place. Even coups. But these bombs carried on. They reached train stations and squares. Here, in Milan. Milan, the capital of the Resistance. The fascists were in cahoots with the watchdogs of the Constitution. Does it seem normal to you? Does it seem normal to you, to erase history? Does what's happening in our country now seem normal? Back then, in response to the violence that they proposed, it was ethical, fair and ethical, to respond with our violence, the violence of the proletariat that came from below, understand? The violence of the proletariat, as you call it, included shooting cops? We didn't have anything against cops. - Cops were better dead?! - Cops were exploited. Worse than the working class, and they still are. So you shot exploited people. The consequences were tragic. We realized too late that a man's death cannot give rise to a better world. I would've never killed a man... But this is what became of my life, my only life. My father became a cop to have a secure future. He was a proletariat, as you say, and ended up being a target for rich daddy's boys. You were all rich, weren't you? I don't know what we were. Plus, what does it matter now? We're losers now. We feel shame and repulsion for what we did. - And pain, which is worse. - Give me a break. What happened to my dad is worse. - And to us. - There was collective hysteria. They said it was like shooting into the dark while the light blinds you. A cursed light, with a black hole that swallows everything, lots of people, friends, comrades, myself. I have a hole in my head. Did he tell you about "Air of the Land"? The outreach center? No. They are very active, they've been causing ruckus for a long time. They stand up for refugees but also supported CGIL union laborers during the Castellammare shipbuilders' crisis. Their fathers were laborers. For example, Fabio Violante's father was a trade unionist and he fought long and hard to keep the shipyard free of Carmine Montuori's men. The camorra boss killed in jail. What about De Falco? De Falco was a part of Montuori's circle since he was a kid. - He and Fabio knew each other? - Yes. And hated each other. They nearly killed each other once. De Falco and his brother were on the extreme right. We're told Fabio wasn't very nice either. He was. - Where is he? - Poggioreale Jail probably. Can I go visit? Only relatives are allowed.

Look who's here? - Are you dating Fabio? - What the hell do you care? - You know Fabio's in jail? - When are you going to jail? I'm a kid. And if they put me in jail, who'll protect you? Fuck off! Wait, don't go. I have a gift for you. Like it? So it was you? - Your school is our turf now. - You did it? You shithead! You're a dirtbag, an asshole! You and all those fuckers who helped you! I'll kill you! I'll kill you! Asshole! Asshole! I should kill you! Dirtbag! Dirtbag! Shithead! Motherfuckers! PURCHASE TICKET TO: NAPLES ONE WAY Hi, mom... I'm coming back I met him, yes.
