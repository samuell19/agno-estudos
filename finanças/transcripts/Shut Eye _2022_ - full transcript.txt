And since I know you guys all loved the last one... why don't you introduce yourself, Ravi? Hello, everyone. Uh, my name is-- [breathing heavily] All right, so it seems like the cheapest plan that we have available is the $10 one. Are you okay with it? [woman] I'll manage that. [Emilio] Perfect. I know that it sounds alarming, but it's just two coffees per month. It's all good, eh? Perfect, so let me just select it for you, and I'll just get you to put your details in, please. Thank you. [tense music playing] [music intensifying] -[music stops] -Now one as well here? Um, yeah, so you just put your surname right there. All right. Thank you so much. That's all good. Have a great day. -You too. See ya. -See ya. Sierra? [banging on door] Sierra. Um, we just got in this morning. Are you-- are you okay? I had lots of messages on my phone. So, you're with him now? Let's talk outside. I thought you knew. Knew what? Well, I'm non-monogamous. What's non-- What's that? It-- it means I... I can't be with just one person. No, but we're together. I-- I need more than that. But that's not fair! You left me alone for days. I've been sick. Sierra, you-- you can't just-- rely on me when you're feeling lonely. I'm my own person, I have my own needs. I'm not always going to be there for you when you want me to. [tense music playing] I mean, doesn't that make sense? Sierra? ♪ [shower running] [Kate's voice echoing] Sorry for... the radio silence. It's been an impulsive kind of week. I decided to take a digital detox and go on a vacation with... mm, with a very special friend. Um, and it was just what I needed. So, tonight I want to introduce you to him. [voice fading out] ...very special friend. [voice echoing] [knocking on door] Are you all right? Sierra? Did you call immigration on that student? [printer humming] And how do you know him? Um, I went on a night out with him. And did he tell you that he was illegally here? Yes. He-- he did, yep. Okay. Let's go. [door shuts] [sighs shakily] [sirens wailing in distance] [Kate sobbing] I'm so sorry, everyone. I'm going to have to cancel this week's streams because it's been... it's been a messy few days. I, um-- I... I just need some time... to myself. [sobbing] I've lost someone dear to me. I'm so sorry. [Sierra] Kate. Sierra. Oh, I got these for you. Oh. Oh, here. Take them. Thanks. I saw your stream. Are you okay? It's Ravi. Immigration came yesterday and took him away. Someone must have called on him. It's, like, he's been in my life for three years and now he's never coming back. Well, maybe it's a good thing. How is that a good thing? It was you. Yeah, now that-- We can be together. Fucking bitch. You're just like the rest of them. A racist fucking bitch! [dog barking] Kate? Kate? [water burbling] [Sierra sniffling] [exhaling] [ringtone chiming] [gasping, splashing] [girl] 14, 13, 12, 11, ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. [voice fading away] Sierra! Sierra! Sierra, Sierra! [waves crashing loudly] [seagulls calling] [Sierra's mom] Sierra, what the fuck's wrong with you? What the fuck? [solemn music] [Sierra breathing heavily] [Sierra] Tonight I learned to swim. And I saw the stars. It was the first time I've seen them in the city. Everything sounds okay. Uh, your blood pressure's a little high, but nothing to worry about. How you sleeping? Better? ASMR art worked. Well, you look a lot better. Okay, well, I think you're good to go. -I never spoke up. -Sorry. I watched my sister drown. You okay? I let her drown and I didn't say anything. I didn't call for help. I mean, that's why I couldn't sleep. I left home 'cause I wanted to forget. But I can't forget. When did this happen? Three years ago. And where's your mom now? Home. Have you spoken to her about this? Am I a bad person? [doctor sighing] No. Well, what am I, then? You're just like everybody else. Trying to make sense of losing someone. It's not easy. [Sierra whimpering] [somber music] [birds chirping] [music fades] [dishes clattering] [mumbling to baby] [Sierra] Mom wanted me to stay this time. But things have changed. -[baby babbling] -[Sierra laughing] [Sierra cooing] -[baby babbling] -[Sierra giggling] Because in your silence, I'll find my voice. And in your eyes... I'll find my love.
