Couldn't have done it without you, mate. This is more than what you owe. I thought you could hang on to the difference for me. What am I supposed to do with it? I don't know. Invest it or summat? Eric, I've told you I'm not a bloody bank. And I've told you, maybe you should be. One that helps out the locals. - Goodnight, Nicky. - Night night Eric. [curious music playing] So, what do you think? About what? This bank thing. Last time I checked, you sold minibuses. Yeah, I know, but… A bank that serves the whole community. - You as a banker? - [laughs] Hmm, you didn't go to Eton, you didn't… didn't go to Oxford, you don't talk posh. Do you really think you could take them buggers on at their own game? I suppose, when you put it like that. Makes me really want to give it a go. Hmm. Well, I'd put my money in t'Bank of Dave. - Would you? - Yeah. - Come on, then. - [laughs] [siren blaring] [man speaking on phone] [phone ringing] - [exhales] - [phone rings] Yes? Okay, I'll be straight in. No! - Morning, Hugh. - Morning. How did it go with the investment bankers last night? Um, I can safely say it couldn't have gone much worse. Poorly, I'd say. What do you call 1,000 dead bankers at the bottom of the sea? - A good start. - [man laughs] I thought it was lawyers. Used to be, but we've been usurped. Right, we just got a referral from Elliot, Grossman, Stein. They can't take the case because of a conflict of interest. - When has that ever stopped them? - [laughs] Right. So, a man wants to open a bank. Is this the start of another joke? This is the case. No. The Financial Regulations Board haven't approved a new bank in a century. Century and a half. Okay, who's the man? He's from Burnley, it's somewhere up north. I've heard of Burnley. I think they've got a football side. - So he's a banker? - He sells vans, I think. Um, I don't know what he wants us to do, Clarence. We're lawyers, Hugh. We're on the side of those paying us. Even if they're guilty. - Even if they're delusional? - Even better. This chap needs our expert legal advice. He needs us to submit the necessary forms for him, he needs us to guide him through the labyrinth of financial rules and regulations. Right into a brick wall. We need to cover ourselves by telling him about potential pitfalls of the scheme. [inhales] Anyway, I said you'd head up there today. What? To Burnley? Uh-huh. No. Come on, Clarence. That's a bit much, isn't it? This isn't going to amount to anything. You're the one who told me never to stray outside the M25. This... Under normal circumstances, those are the rules, but having just signed off on your expenses that yielded precisely zero in billing from the investment bankers, there's another applicable expression… Which is? Beggars can't be choosers. [clicks tongue] Great. ["Kick" by Def Leppard playing] [Hugh enunciating] Burnley. [changes accent] Burnley. [changes accent] Burn-ley. I look for Burnley.

Ah, Hugh, you made it! Great. Take a load off. How were your journey? - Yes, fine, fine. Shall we just get… - [Dave] Great. …straight to it, shall we? - Sounds good to me. - Yes. So… [clears throat] …I understand that you would like… to open a bank. That's right. [taps desk] The Bank of Dave. That's… [laughs] That's… It's catchy. Very catchy. So, tell me, how did this idea come about? - So, as you can see, I sell minibuses. - Yes. [Dave] I used to sell vans. I've got seven of these dealerships across Lancashire and Yorkshire, and, uh, well, I won't deny it, I make good money. Now, a couple of year back, the country were in recession, and, uh, my customers were havin' problems making payments. - So I started lending them me own money. - Okay. Pretty soon, I were making loans to families and small businesses in the local area. - Why didn't they go to the banks? - They couldn't. For all sorts of reasons, the banks wouldn't touch 'em. Okay. - Don't get me started on those buggers. - The banks? They caused the recession. Speculating, treating the economy like it were a bloody casino. [sighs] Yeah. [Dave] Got greedier and greedier. Until the whole house of cards came tumbling down. And then, the government bailed them out. With billions of pounds of tax money. It came from the pockets of the same people whose money they lost. Hmm. Not their finest hour, that's for sure. - Bloody right. - You were… Yeah. - That's not the worst of it. - No. Then, the top dogs decide to keep paying themselves millions in bonuses. - For losing money. - I know, but… - Bunch of tossers. - But… - They should all be in jail. - Hmm. Yeah, but, back to the loans… - You were making, you were saying… - Right. - So, I lent out just over a million quid. - A million pounds. Can you guess how many of those loans went bad? Oh, I… [puffs] …seven? Try again, Hugh. - Three, I mean, I don't... - Warmer. Not a single one. - Wow. - Zip-a-de-doo-dah. In fact, some of me customers started making money. And they asked me to invest it for 'em. For which you need accreditation. [laughs] Spot on, Hugh. - That's why you're here. - Yes. Uh, one last thing. This isn't about me making money. Every single penny of profit goes straight to local charities. Oh, that's… That's, um… It's charitable, isn't it? That's… Yeah, great. - You don't look very convinced, Hugh. - No, it's... I don't have any… You're not paying me to tell you what you want to hear, you're paying me to… [inhales] …point out all the pitfalls and stumbling blocks and problems you are going to face. Ah, and hopefully to find a way around 'em. Yeah. Right, so firstly I'm going to need to see the paperwork of those loans and the financials of your businesses. Phyllis has got all that ready for you. Great. I'll talk to Phyllis and get back to you. - Nine o'clock, here tomorrow morning? - Tomorrow? Uh, yes, okay. - Yes. - Great to meet you, Hugh. Great. Welcome to Burnley. [man] Thank you, your worship. [gavel slams] In order to relieve pressure on both hospitals and GPs, we need to find a way to bridge the gap between primary and tertiary care. This proposed facility does that in the most efficient and economical way. Doctor Ashforth. Shouldn't the NHS be the ones to fund this facility? The National Health Service has agreed to fund the running costs of the facility, but we still need the initial capital outlay. [incredulous] Which is considerable. And our limited resources are already committed in other areas. Well… Burnley has already earned the dubious distinction of being one of the most deprived towns in the country. We're caught in a spiral of neglect and decay. I mean, clearly something has to change. But change takes courage. That's a quality sadly lacking in this council, and in this country. [councillors] Hear, hear. [gavel slams] [Hugh] I can't believe I have to stay for the night. [Clarence, over phone] You'll survive. [Hugh] Starting a new bank. He doesn't have a hope. I told him that but he wanted the chance to convince you. - How much are we charging him? - The full whack. Oh, no, we're not, are we? God, I feel bad. [scoffs] That's a first. [Hugh] No, I do. I feel bad I'm gonna have to tell him to give up on the whole thing. Well, my advice is, let him down gently and then see if he's willing to explore other opportunities. Yeah. Yeah, I guess… - Okay, thank you. Bye. - Alright. Bye, Hugh. - [horns beeping] - [car alarm blaring] Bollocks. [comical suspenseful music playing] Bollocks. Stupid, stupid… [wrench clatters] [child] What's he doing, Dad? - [dad] You alright there, mate? - Huh? - Are you…? - Yeah, I'm fine, thank you. Come on, then. [jack clangs] [screams] Bollocks! - [water bubbling] - [motor droning] [exhales] Oh, my God. - [phone ringing] - [baby crying] Hey, hey, sorry. I was wondering when I'm gonna get to see a doctor. I'm in a lot of pain. It won't be too long. I'm afraid it's been a busy night. Don't know if this makes a difference, but I've got a private health care plan. [scoffs] - What? - Hear that, Dr. Ashforth? He's got a private health care plan. Oh! Well, wouldn't say that too loud. Round here we tend to believe that health is a basic human right. Not a privilege available to only those who can afford it. No, I'm not negating anybody else's pain. I'm just saying I'm in pain also, okay? I've dropped a… A, uh… a car thing on my foot. Okay? - [Dr. Ashforth] Careless. - Excuse me? Michelle, would you, uh, give him some aspirin? Wait your turn. [barely audible radio broadcast] Oh, dear. - What's happened? - [Hugh] Nothing. Just a… An accident changing a flat tyre. - Anything broken? - Thankfully, no. Just my pride. You muppet. Is the car still there? Yes. I'll have one of the lads get it sorted, brought back here. Thank you. [humming] [Dave whistling] Fancy a brew? [Hugh] No, thank you. Look, Dave, I know I said yesterday that it was my job to look for all the problems and pitfalls, um… but, actually, it's a bit worse than that, because… [Dave] I know what you're gonna say. I know you're gonna tell me that the Bank of Dave is never gonna happen. You're gonna say that the Financial Regulation Board hasn't approved a new bank in 150 years. - Am I right? - Yeah. [Dave] We got Google up here too. But, please. Indulge me, hmm? Just for a day. There is method in me madness. - I promise. - Okay. - Second loan I made were to Jamie. - Okay. Come out here one morning and it were quiet. His amp had packed up. That's how he made a living. But with no bank account, no address, where were he supposed to turn? So I got him a new one and he paid me back two quid a week. - Two quid… - Never missed a single payment. - Good on, you, Jamie. - Eh up, Dave. You alright? - ♪ It's gonna be… ♪ - Come on. Sorry, I...

Afternoon all. Two black coffees, please Jenny. - [Hugh] A macchiato with oat milk? - There she is! - My favourite niece. - Hiya, Dave. - [Dave] How are you? - Good, how are you? [Dave] Smashing. Oh, shit. Hi. - Should've known you were Dave's banker. - I'm a lawyer, actually, but, yeah… How's the bruised big toe? It's a bit more than bruised, but it's okay. [Dave] You've met already? - Yes. - Yeah. Hugh's advising me on setting up this Bank of Dave. Which we need to get our project off the ground. - Hmm. - Sorry, what is that? You know all about waiting times at the A&E. Here, they're some of the worst in the country, and it's because the people we deal with don't actually need hospital treatment. Their ailments could just as easily be treated by GPs, but it takes, on average, 11 days to get an appointment. And, well… No one wants to wait that long when they're sick. So, we're proposing a walk-in free clinic. They can write prescriptions, run diagnostic tests, make referrals. Sounds like a good idea. - [Dave] Don't it? - Yeah. The NHS agrees, but they've already been pared to the bone. And the council weren't interested so thought I'd try Dave. If you were to register as a charity, that'd be a huge incentive for corporate sponsors. I mean, I know it's corporate, but… No, that… Yeah, that makes a lot of sense, actually. [phone vibrates] - Oh. Sorry, I'm on call. - Oh, right. - Got to run. I'll leave that there. - Okay. Great. - Well, nice to… - Yeah. Look after that bruised big toe. I will. It's fine now, actually. Not completely fine, but… - Right. - Yeah. - See you, Dave. - [Dave] See you. - Thanks. - [Jenny] No, problem, Alex. So, she's… What's all this? All the projects that are too big for me on me own. Um… - Up till now, I've helped create 150 jobs. - Yeah. In here, there's hundreds more. - I get it, Dave. - It's not just jobs. It's about the quality of life for a whole community. This is all really impressive. Okay, but unfortunately, the Financial Regulation Board doesn't care about this. Question I want you to answer isn't "can the Bank of Dave exist?" The question, after what you've seen today, is "should the Bank of Dave exist?" Well… Yes. Yes, it should. Right. So, this is what I want you to do. I want you to file the necessary paperwork with the Finance Commission Board. I know they're gonna turn me down, but I want them to tell me why. I want them to admit publicly that it's because I'm not in their club. I'm not part of the Eton and Oxford elite. I want them to say that the very same people who've just lost 500 billion quid are the only people entitled to look after our money. And you don't mind losing? Of course I bloody mind. But it's the price I'm willing to pay to get them to admit the truth. Okay, yeah. Yeah, I'm in. I'll give your boss a bell. Tell him you're still on the clock. [laughs] That'll make his day. Alright. Time to celebrate. And, as luck would have it… tonight's karaoke night. Oh, no, thank you. Alexandra will be there. Really? [laughter] [Dave] What I didn't tell you is that Eric used to be shop steward at the Michelin factory before it closed down. And he was a real bloody troublemaker. - Now he employs 25 workers. - Thirty. - This bugger turned me into a capitalist. - It happens. Can barely look at myself in the mirror of a morning. - Hugh… - [Hugh] Thanks. - I'd like to introduce you to Maureen. - Nice to meet you. First loan I made that weren't for a van or a minibus were to Maureen. I heard you got yourself a posh London lawyer to sort out this bank thing. When you take on the fat cats, you gotta have someone who knows how to play their game. I told Dave he was wasting his time with the idea, but he's managed to convince me. - Dave can be very persuasive. - Yes. I hope, for his sake, you're half as good. Well… hopefully. So, you received the first loan from Dave? Yeah. I were married to Ron for 38 years. When he died, I had very little money in the bank. I couldn't have afforded a proper funeral without Dave and Nicky's help. - [mic feedback] - [host] Right, first up. All the way from London… It's Hugh. - [Eric] Get up there. - [Dave] Go on. - [Maureen] That's you. - No. - I picked an easy one. - Not nice. - [Dave] You'll be fine. - No, no. - You know this one, you'll like this. - No, thank you. - Let's give him a round of applause. - [Hugh] No, thank you. - No, right, I'll just press play. - [Dave] Hugh! - [crowd chanting] Hugh! - ["Losing My Religion" by REM playing] [crowd cheering] [Nicky whooping] I honestly don't want to do this.

Uh, thank you. [calm music playing] [laughs] [knocking] My God, Hugh. what did they do to you up there in the North? It's nothing. Silly. My fault. I got a call from Mr Fishwick. He's keeping you on at your full hourly rate. Which is, of course, music to my ears. He also said he'd convinced you to move forward on the Bank of Dave. - Yes. - Must be a hell of a salesman. Explain, because this I have to hear. The banks are literally a law unto themselves. They've created a model of what a bank should be, which is exactly like them. Dave Fishwick's proposal is a new model. A small local bank taking local deposits, investing back into the local community. That's a nice idea. - FRB will never go for it, though. - No, of course they won't. But they are going to have to justify why the status quo is so much better. So, you want to take them on in the court of public opinion? That's not a bad idea, given the public opinion has never being so negative. But expect them to fight dirty. The good news is they have to win and we don't mind losing. [Clarence] Hmm. I'm liking this more and more. What do you need? Any advice you have on submitting to the FRB. You're going to need a business plan. Talk to your friend Oscar. He churns them out every day. Yeah, that's a great idea. Thanks, Clarence. So, these are all old, but they all follow the same pattern. Huge upside, almost no risk. I'll email you the software that makes this a piece of piss. These are great. Thank you. What's this for? - Um… - I know, I know. You could tell me but then you'd have to kill me. Something like that, yeah. So, tell me, how's married life treating you? [sighs] - Oh, really? - Hmm. Come on, it's not that bad. The baby keeps us up half the night, every night. Priscilla is moody as fuck all the time. And the house looks like Ground Zero. Aside from that, I've… I've never been happier. It sounds great to me. [indistinct chatter] [woman] Hugh. - Hey, Hen. How you doing? - Hi. [laughs] Never better. Will you join me? - No, I… - Oh, please. Bloody Cynthia stood me up at the last minute. A client dinner the dozy cow had forgotten about. I'll be legless if I drink this on my own. - Please. - [hesitates] Okay, I'll have one. So, what have you been up to? I've just come back from the North. - Hampstead? - Uh, Burnley. Oh. Sounds grim. Actually, it's a surprisingly pretty part of the world. They've got a great football side. Who knew? [laughs] How's work? [inhales] It's full on. Giles is… Well, he's an arsehole. As you know. - Yeah. - But I can honestly say I'm loving it. Great. I saw you and Jem the other night. How's he doing? Yeah, he's good. He, um… He just got a big promotion. Great. [Hen] Hmm. [muffled sobs] Oh, no. Oh no, what have I done? [cries] Sorry. Oh, my God, it's so embarrassing. Sorry. [breathless sob] - He dumped me. - Oh, shit. I'm so sorry, Hen. That's… I mean, what am I gonna do? He's my boss now. I can't go back to work there, but I… I can't afford to lose my job. - [gasping sob] - I'm sure it'll work itself out. - Maybe… Maybe slow down. - [waitress] Yes, madam. - Maybe not drink so much if you're sad. - This one, yeah. Thank you. [waitress] Absolutely. - You okay? - I'm fine. - There's a step coming up. - One, two, three. Good. Nice. - Um… - [Hen giggling] - Okay. - Thank you. Oh! Oh, no, no, no, no, Hen. No. You're vulnerable, I'm vulnerable. This… this won't solve anything. - No? - No. - Okay. - Okay. [groans] I do miss you though, Hugh. - I miss you too. - Hmm. - We were so good together. - Yeah. - Can I ask a favour? - What do you want? All of Jem's stuff is at my house. - Can I stay at your house? - Of course. But let's just… - Get into the cab, please. Yeah. - Yeah. Okay. [Hugh grunts] [Hen] Hmm. - Okay? - [Hen] Yes. - Please be careful... - [Hen] Hello! [thud, yelps] [sirens blaring] [soft piano chords playing] [dog barking] [grunts] [dog barking] Oh, Christ. [moans softly] [sighs] Thank God. [sighs] Hmm. [ominous music playing] [scoffs] [water pouring] - Hey. - [Hen] Hello. - How are you doing? Are you okay? - [rueful laugh] Hmm. I have made you a very strong coffee. Thank you. Sorry about last night. I was in shocking shape. Don't be. I was glad I was there to help. Can we go for dinner soon? You know, like normal people. When I'm not completely off my face. Yes. Whenever you like. Tonight? Yeah. Um… Yeah. - How's it going? - Good. Getting there. Excellent. Because I found someone you should speak to. Sir Charles Denbigh. Friend of a friend. He was on the board of the FRB until three years ago. These days, he mainly does legal consultancy for hedge funds. And he's going to be helpful? This needs to go public. Spin Sir Charles a convincing yarn, he won't be able to help himself. He'll be on the phone right away to his friends in high places in the banking world. Then you can tap into the one thing you have on your side. Everybody hates bankers. Precisely. Toodle pip. Everybody hates bankers. - [classical piano playing softly] - [indistinct male chatter] [clears throat] Sir Charles? Hmm. Hugh Stockwell from Bentham and Green. Oh, you work with… Lawrence. - Yeah, Clarence. Yes. - [Charles] Clarence? Oh… I've never met the man. In fact, until yesterday, I'd never even heard of him. [laughs] But, anyway, you're here now, so… How can I be of service? Firstly, thank you. Everybody tells me you're the country's leading expert on the banking system. Oh, well. I've put in my time. I'll be brief. I represent a client who is looking into establishing a new retail bank. [whispers] Not an American, I hope. [laughs] No. The gentleman in question is definitely English. - Yah. - Um… The question is more about scale. In the rest of the economy, we have large and small companies. We have a chain of supermarkets and corner shops. - Greengrocers, butchers. - Your point? Well, my point is, why do all banks have to be like supermarkets? Isn't there room for a few corner shops? You're talking about Hoares. Am I? Oldest bank in the country, tiny. Caters for very exclusive clientele, old money. No. Wh… What about people on the other end of the spectrum? New money? No money. [puzzled laugh] I'm not… quite sure what you're getting at, Mr Stockwell, but there is no right size of bank. The FRB exists to make sure that people's hard-earned money is entrusted to the… [inhales] …well, right kind of chap. - [Hugh] The type of chap you can trust? - Precisely. If their job is selecting the type of chap you can trust… [puffs] …you'd have to admit they've been doing a pretty piss-poor job, haven't they? - I beg your pardon. - Anyway, thank you, Sir Charles. My client is the type of chap people in his community can trust. So… I'm sure there won't be any problems. Thank you. [grunts] - [Hugh] What do you think? - [Dave, on phone] Looks bloody fantastic. Wouldn't be surprised if they say yes. [chuckles] I don't know about that, Dave. I'm going to hand-deliver this to the FRB on Friday, so speak soon. Okay? Cheers. How was your day, anyway? [sighs] Fraught. Everyone was being incredibly nice to me, which is a sure sign they're gonna get rid of you. - How about you? - Ah… I had a meeting with Sir Charles Denbigh. - You're kidding. - Yeah, I did. - He's a legend. - Is he, though? Yes. He was tipped to be the possible governor of the Bank of England before the recession. What did he want to talk about? Nothing. I was picking his brains about something. - Um… - Meetings with Sir Charles Denbigh. - Secret trips to the North. - Hmm. - It's hardly secret, Hen. - What are you involved in, Hugh? - Not involved… - Come on, spill. I'm filling the formal paperwork out at the end of the week, so till then, it has to be just between us. Of course. I have a client who wants to start a new bank. You're kidding. He's aware the FRB will inevitably turn him down, but he wants to force them to go public with what they think a bank should be. Well, that'll certainly stir things up. Your client's credible? [doubtful laugh] Yeah. He's certainly a character, but… But, yeah, I think he is. [Hen] Hmm. - May I help you? - Hey. I'm here to submit a proposal for the establishment of a new bank. [laughs] I'm not sure that's something we deal with here. According to the Financial Markets and Services Act passed in 2000, it is. Oh… uh… If you'd like to take a seat, I'll find someone who can help. - Thank you. - Okay. [phone clatters, dial tone] - Apologies for keeping you waiting. - Hey. Edward De Thame. Hugh Stockwell from Bentham and Green. Here is the proposal. It's a long time since we've had an application for a new bank. - 150 years, I'm told. - Indeed. - Right, we'll be in touch. Right. - Brilliant. [man, over phone] Giles, Sir Charles Denbigh on line one. [nervous grunt] [clears throat] Sir Charles. What can I do for you? Your friend Hugh Stockwell is causing us problems. [Giles] Hugh? He's not exactly a friend. We hired him a while back just to do some legal donkey work. He's just filed with the FRB to set up a new bank. [Giles] Doesn't sound like Hugh. He's hardly a high-flyer. Well, it's hardly a high-flying bank either. More of a corner shop. I see. So, less of a problem. [Charles] Quite the opposite. It's one thing rich foreign corporations trying to home in on our business. We know how to deal with those buggers, but once… ordinary people start thinking they can get in on the act, the floodgates'll open. Of course. I see. So… So how can I help, Sir Charles? I may need to call on you at some point. For now, I have the situation well in hand. [soft suspenseful music playing] [exhales] [dial tone] [Hen, on phone] Sir Charles. Do we have a deal? [Charles] Send me that page and you'll have your promotion. [suspenseful music playing] [distant siren blaring] [sirens approaching] Bloody hell? [car door slamming] [indistinct voices] [radio chatter] [dial tone] [phone vibrating] Hello. [Alexandra] Dave's been arrested. On what charge? Loan sharking. [Hugh] Really? [hesitates] Um, I… I'll call you back. I can't find anything illegal here. These are all person-to-person loans. Unless there's coercion or threats of violence, it's not loan sharking. Go to page 11. I haven't got page 11. Probably still in the photocopier. You've got the photocopied version. These are the originals. The first loan Dave made was through Fishwick Motors. [Hugh] So what? He has a lending licence. He's allowed to lend money to buy a van or a minibus. This is for funeral expenses. Surely that's just a minor technicality. It's illegal money lending, for which you'll get a slap on the wrist, and a criminal record. - Of course. - I told you they'd fight dirty. [Dave] This isn't a big deal. They let me out on bail after a couple of hours. - But they did charge you? - Yeah. - Can I see the charge sheet? - [Dave] Alright. - [Hugh] Hello. - Hi. [Hugh] This is actually very serious. The police said the magistrates might fine me a few quid. - I'm not gonna prison. - But you would have a criminal record. Which means you wouldn't be able to run a financial institution. Exactly. If they get a conviction for this, they've won. There's no more Bank of Dave. [Nicky] There you go, love. - [Dave sighs] - [Hugh] Thank you. [Hugh clears throat] It weren't even supposed to be a loan. Sorry? The one they're talking about. The first… to Maureen. - Yeah. - I've known her and Ron for years. He deserved a proper send-off. I were happy to pay for it, but Maureen didn't want charity. So, I used one of the forms from Fishwick Motors to make it into a loan. When she paid me back, I had to file the paperwork. [sighs] So… what's Dave's
