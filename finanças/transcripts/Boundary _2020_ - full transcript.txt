What do you remember? I don't. Concentrate, It'll help jog your memory. I was taking samples. That's correct. You still have some amnesia, but you're doing better. What happened to me? Mr. Massey, a few days ago you had an accident at work. You almost drowned. You were in shock when they brought you into the emergency room. And because of the near drowning, you had hypoxia. That's a low level of oxygen in the blood. This has caused some injury to your brain and other organ systems. I fell in. That's correct. You fell in and... you were alone. I need to make sure I can trust you with this. When you've done the job, go to the drop-off point and meet me be back here. This is your second chance. Give it to me. This plane lands at 2:00 a.m. He always parks in parking lot number six, no security cameras, very few people park there. He'll be alone. Make sure you are, too. My name is Michael Massey and I'm about to make the biggest mistake of my life. Again. This one I saw coming. The first one crept up behind me. I had my back turned. Hey, guys, wait up. Sorry, I had to put my gloves on. Michael, put that barrel over by the storage area. Okay. Floyd, I'm ready. I had fun, I was tired though. My hand was killing me. I just needed one strike, one strike and I would've won the game. You ever bowled a perfect game? Never have. Must be hard. My best score is 150. Right now, all I see is what lies straight ahead. I need to turn and around, I need to face the world. I know what's there, family. That was a sure thing. Friends. They're waiting for me to turn around and face them. But before I do that... Yeah, that. ...I have to squeeze this trigger one more time. Nice work, ese. Cleanest one so far. I like a man who makes my job easier. It's just this one time, open the gate. I heard that one before, but you? You're different. No bullet hole, no broken glass. You got your corpses in trunk, out of view. You drive in a common vehicle for these parts, homie. I worked with guys like you before. I know why you're here. You got something to prove. Open the gate now. Or what, ese? You take out your piece, blast me? You got your piece... but this here... ...this is my piece. And an hombre like you, clean, professional. You're not going to let all this good work go to waste. You want to get paid? Get your hands dirty, ese. Hey there, you need some help? I saw you carrying all this luggage there. I figured you might need a hand. No, no, no, put this one down, push that one back. We'll put that one at last. That's good, now push it all the way back. Keep pushing, keep pushing. Put it right back there. Sorry, I'm late. Don't look at me like that. You could have cleaned your gun after the meeting. You wanted this job done right? I did that. No doubt. This is a different battlefield now. How do you feel? I feel, I feel dirty. Oh, that's right. You do work at the... How do you know that? Relax, I did some digging. I always like to get to know the people that I work with. Look, it gets easier. The first one is always the most difficult but the next one, after that. There's not going to be a next one. This was it. Don't be so sure. Anyways, you got something for me. The junk yard cretin took care of everything. Good. Rodrigo's a scumbag, but I put him to a good use. He gets things done. Well, this is cause for a celebration. - I prefer cash. - Oh, no, no, no, no. Watch, look at this. We busted this guy last week. He was acting strange, so I pulled him aside. You know what I found? 300 candy bars just like this one, stashed in a suitcase. These guys get so creative. It's quite a show. As a customs agent, I have front-row seats. That's nice, gimme my money. All right? Look... ...I know how you feel. Okay, you went to war, it wasn't what you thought. You never got to look... ...a bad guy in the eyes and just fucking pull the trigger. Tonight I gave you that chance. You got to be a warrior. Imbeciles like the candy man, I just turn over to authorities. The guy you took care of tonight, he wasn't a peon, he was a major player. You did the world a favor, and so did I. I'm not going to tell you again. Give me the money, now. Doesn't have to end like this. You know we could be a great team. Listen, this concludes our business. Don't ever contact me again. Oh, I won't. Might be somebody else who will though. I thought this was a one-man operation. It's this one guy, might be a cop. Someone from my work, I don't know. I've seen him follow me a few times. You need to take care of this. This affects both of us. I'm giving you another job. This time... ...I'll pay double. Where have you been? What is that? Our second chance. A friend came through with a loan. Well, whatever it is, it isn't enough. - How do you know that? - Because the money we need doesn't fit inside an envelope. Look, it's enough okay? In the meantime, I want you to stop packing all these boxes, get rid of this bubble wrap and... And what? Give me a hug. Well, something up here is going to get squeezed. Don't pop the bubbles, that is so annoying. You told me to get rid of all of it With all this bubble wrap, it'll take all night. Now stop, Emily, stop. Look, they're not taking this house, okay? If they do, they're gonna have to drag us out of here kicking and screaming. Well... that's going to happen to one of us anyway. But he's going to have to wait another four months. Your hands are cold. It's just one more job. Don't look at me like that. He offered you another job. I told you this was a bad idea. You knew he'd give you another one. You must have something inside you that wants to prove something. You should have never gotten involved. - We're both involved. - No, not me. You can find another private investigator. I am done taking pictures. I wish I could say the same for him. Open it. You were the one supposed to take the pictures. I hired you to follow him, not the other way around. Look, I did this as a favor. You came to me, remember? He offered me double. I'll stop following him. It's too late. He wants you dead. And he knows where I work. It's only a matter of time before he figures out we're working together. What if he already knows? Then I'll have to squeeze that trigger one more time. Okay, before you do that, some things you might want to know. His name is Douglas Gofft. Former military, now a customs inspector at the airport. He must have gotten some intel about drug shipments overseas. He uses his position to let smugglers sneak through and then he steals their stash and sells it for himself. Runs a pretty efficient operation. All under the radar. I got to get to my store unit, I need to get my piece. You can't do that. You know what happens if you do that? I don't have a choice. I'm busy, what do you need? You seen James around? He left early. - He left early? - Yep. He did the same thing yesterday. He left right after you did. Hey, Michael, come here for a sec. Hey, I need you to take some samples for me. The crew's late today and I'm getting ready to head out. Arms up. Something wrong? You violated your probation. - Are you opening my mail now? - This is serious. What were you doing in a high school parking lot? How is this going to benefit me and our unborn child if you're sitting in a jail cell? I was meeting with a friend. He's the one who gave me the money. Well, next time you meet this friend, do it in public during the day. There won't be a next time. What are you looking at? I was just waiting to see if that guy out there was going to come look at the house. Anyways, I talked to my brother. He said he could get an attorney that could work with us for free. When a man becomes distracted, he makes mistakes. He makes bad choices. He gets sloppy. Yesterday, that man paid me a visit. But who was it? Douglas or James? Hey, James. You got a minute. I'm busy right now. What do you need? You drive a black car, don't you? Michael, you've seen my car. Now, what's this about? I had a visitor yesterday, a guy in a black car. When I came outside, he took off. And you think it was me? I'm not sure. Douglas drives a black car, too. Then it was Douglas. Let's hope he doesn't come back then. 'Cause if anyone comes near my house and hurt my family, they're going to be sorry they did. You're not allowed to have a gun in your house, Michael. I would be careful about violating that court order. Joey, come here. You know what I think would be a good idea? Go get your crayons. Get a sheet of paper and draw daddy a picture. I think he'll like that. Mommy, look what I drew for daddy. Michael. I'm headed out. I need you to take some samples. Okay. James is here if you need help. Everything all right between you two? Why do you ask? You've been smoking alone this past week and when you leave, he leaves behind you. Almost like he's following you home, keeping tabs on you. Anything you want to tell me about? Are you done? - Are you forgetting something? - Floyd, everything's fine between us, don't worry about it. I'm glad to hear. Go down to the boundary and take some samples. James will give you a hand. James! Mr. Massey, a few days ago, you had an accident at work. You almost drowned. You were in shock when they brought you into the emergency room. And because of the near drowning, you had hypoxia. That's a low level of oxygen in the blood. This has caused some injury to your brain and other organ systems. Fuck! Come on, get up. - Mom, look at my picture. - Oh. That's a beautiful picture. Go show daddy, he's over there. Daddy, look at my picture. That's good, now push it all the way back. Keep pushing, keep pushing, put it right back there. Hold it. Drink it, Michael, it's water. What happened? You need to tell me what's happening. I need answers. Michael. Damn it, Michael. This trigger will be pulled. But what I really want to do is pull back the hands of time. Retrace every step... ...and start over. But I can't. I'm alone. Michael, I called an attorney today. Michael... ...I wanted to say, I'm sorry. I know I've been really mean these past couple days and you're going through a lot, and I'm going of a lot. And I know that you're thinking about what's best for me and our family, but I need to know what's on your mind. Okay. I'm going to go to the grocery store to get a couple things. I'll be back in a few hours. James, I need to talk to you. Yeah, I'm in the middle of something. What you're doing right now can wait. I need to know what happened the day Michael fell in because I've got the state investigators crawling up my ass wanting answers that only you can give 'em and you're not giving 'em to me. He fell in. Then why was your vest so clean? You have the report. Can I get back to work? Go ahead and finish up. If you take this job, you're gonna be watching your back for a long time. I don't have a choice. Let's just hope you don't meet another man who feels the same way. Where have you been? Everything's fine. Just go back to sleep. - What's up? - I need you to go down and help Michael get some water samples. - No problem. - I'm heading out. You guys are the only ones here, so be careful. You know it's slippery down there. Gotcha. You got something to prove. You need to take care of this. This affects both of us. Is something wrong? Emily. Emily... ...put down the gun. Is it the same gun? Is it? Emily. Answer me! Yes. You broke our rule. Our rule, you broke it. I brought it back to protect you. This is my second chance. This is our second chance. Emily... we'll get a second chance. There is some concern that the chemicals you were exposed to might put you at risk of cancer of the liver as well as some of the other organs and tissues. There is a new experimental drug I would like to put you on which may help reduce your risk of malignant conversion in cells which have been damaged. This may reduce your risk of getting hepatocellular cancer or cancers of some of the other organs, too, such as the bone marrow or the kidneys. I'm a little concerned about your throat. I'd like to schedule you for another endoscopic to recheck these areas. What's the best way to give a man a second chance? Let him redeem himself. A man needs to feel useful. She didn't see me. I made that mistake once. I'm not gonna do it again. The trap doesn't work with vinegar, only honey. Tape up the sides, these boxes are pretty old. So where'd you get all these books anyway? Here and there, collected them over the years. You got some pretty good ones that should be at home on a bookshelf instead of here in a dusty storage unit. Yeah. Things are better now. That's what I heard. Thompson said you can start work next week. Yeah, it's going to be different this time. Yeah, that's for sure. We've been going through all these safety procedures since the accident. They want to make sure something like that doesn't happen again. It won't... ...because this time... ...I won't turn my back on you. Stand up and face me, James. Turn around. I guess we're not here to move boxes. No, we're here to find out the truth. I told Emily mine and now you're going to tell me yours. What are you talking about? Tell me the truth. Michael, put the gun down. If it wasn't for you, Douglas never would've given me that second job. You should have never taken the first job. I told you not to get involved with this. You got in trouble 'cause you crossed the line. Tell me the truth, did you push me? Is that what you think? Tell me. You want the truth? I'll give you the truth. When you went to Douglas, it wasn't for money. You wanted to prove you could kill someone other than your own kid. Take one more step and I swear to God it'll be your last. You're working with him, aren't you? That's why you pushed me. - He's paying you, isn't he? - It was an accident. I gave you CPR. The only reason you're standing there right now is because of me. Take a moment and think. Try to remember. You'll be okay, you'll be okay. One, two, three, four, one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four. Listen to me. We're both involved now. It's only a matter of time before Douglas comes out to both of us. I have an idea. One thing I've noticed lately, late night meetings come in pairs. What's this? Signing bonus. I just want to make sure my newest employee's happy. - I thought you said this was a two-hand... - If you're referring to the third wheel of our business, that's why we have layoffs. Helps eliminate any liabilities. He's at his house, now's a good time. Hmm. I only see one car, but we may have a visitor. What? His wife, she came back to him. I thought you said she left? She did, now she's back. This will complicate things. I'll also tell you, his wife is pregnant. Well then, she better not get my way. Oh, she has nothing to do with this. You kill her, then you're going to have two dead bodies you got to get rid. It's not like I'd be doing anything he hasn't done before. Now I told you that was an accident. His own kid? Was a new gun. He was cleaning it. Go up there, tell him you want to talk about something important. Make sure you leave the door unlocked. Distract him. Get 'em in a room that's well lit. Keep him away from the windows and the furniture. I'll go in and get a clear shot. She's there, I'm going to have to say that I have to talk to him in private. Like about the investigation of something so... ...let's keep this on the same level, first floor. Has the kitchen and a bedroom. Go down the hallway, both are on the right. If we're not in the kitchen, just keep going by. Yeah. Move. - Hey, what's going on man? - Hey. - Come on in, man. - Sure, sure. - I came to check on you, how you feeling? - Uh, thanks, man. You know, I'm doing all right. - Just taking it day by day. - Resting? Yeah, little bit. You know, it's been a while since I pulled the trigger. But I always love a good challenge. Getting close to him, that'll be difficult. At least one of us tried to anyway. You know, there are better ways to kill a man than to push him into a pool of chemicals. I didn't, he just fell in. Regardless, we get a second chance. I had my back turned to the world for too long. Now I've turned around and what I see is a world I neglected. He said we have to wear hard hats at all times. Even on our cigarette breaks A world I walked away from. A world that has become the one I deserve. Anyway, the investigation's about to wrap up. - Oh, that's good. - It'll be over soon. But I see something, something I didn't see before. Someone walking towards me, he looks familiar. He isn't a stranger, he's the man I used to be. My name is Michael Massey, and I'm going to pull this trigger one more time. Except this time... ...it won't be a mistake. You motherfuckers!
