[flames rumbling] [dramatic orchestral music] [dramatic orchestral music] [upbeat jazz music] [horn honking] - We all want to feel like we're somebody. Always a pleasure to see you too, Miss. [upbeat jazz music] [phone ringing] - Cheese. - Cheese. - Congrats. - Thank you. - Very much. - Hey, Nick. Hey Charlie, congrats. Great photo. - Thank you. Thank you. - Hey, you won't have to use the centerfold. [men laughing] [guys chuckling] Those guys could sell an ice machine to Eskimos. - Did you read those copy ideas I faxed you last night? - Listen, I'm an art director, I'm not a eunuch. I was on a date, which is what you should have been doing. - We have a week to pitch the antacid account. - You ever try one of these things? It's like chewing on old cigarette butts. - We don't have to like 'em, we just have to sell 'em. [phone ringing] Hello. Hi Larry. We'll be right there. - I'm gonna take you guys off the antacid thing, and give you a chance to pitch Slam Beer. - Wow. - Well, this is definitely big. - We are talking Super Bowl big. Slam is the first piece of Hilkner Beer to open up in years. If we get Slam, we're in a prime position to pick up the entire Hilkner account. - Yeah, we know, you guys have been working on this for months. - Yeah, the client pitch is in a week and we're going nowhere. And I thought you guys might be able to breathe some fucking life into this thing. - All right, fire at Will. Slam is Hilkner's sub premium beer. High volume, high profit margin, high alcohol content. Target audience is African American males, emphasis on the youth market. But these guys at least gotta look like they're 21. We're going for something, you know, street. You got it? - Got it - Got it. - Good. And I wanna have your rough ideas on Monday at 10:00 a.m. okay? You'll be competing against Charlie and Nick on this one. Don't worry. Nia, you might have the edge on this one. The closest Charlie and Nick ever came to the Black experience was watching a sitcom. [laughing] - I mean, she's barely out of college. The only reason she got on this, is 'cause she's the only Black in creative. - Right. - Okay, you're living in a housing project, and you don't have a job, or you do have a job, but it's a dead end job. You want to. - Get out. - Where to? - To an island paradise, Saint Bart's. - Right. - Well, you're the copywriter. What are you asking me for? - Oh, why can I get this? I should be able to get this. - You'll get this, you just gotta relax. You just gotta, you know, just breathe, you'll get it. You should take up yoga. [slowly exhaling] - I gotta get outta here. [horn beeping] [traffic passing] [muffled hip hop music] - [Kid] Come on, put it up, put it up. [hip hop music] ♪ In the woods you're smoking ♪ What love got to do with what you got ♪ ♪ No shit, this shit is hot. ♪ Let them not for [indistinct] ♪ [traffic passing] [hip hop music] [crowd cheering] - [Announcer] After playing a hard game of one on one, there's nothing like an icy cold bottle of Slam Beer. Slam Beer, it's a slam dunk. - I'm your target audience, ages six to 14. [laughing] - Just tell me you've got something. - Don't worry. It's a slam dunk. - And then we hire a rap artist to sing all the lyrics. Slam. - The rapper. Okay. - And we shoot the whole thing like a sexy, but very street smart hip hoppy music video. - What do you guys got? - What do young inner city Black men want? They want out. What's a ticket out? Basketball. What makes them feel good? Shooting hoops with their boys. And how does Slam Beer make them feel? It makes them feel like they're flying through the air, doing a slam dunk. - And the whole thing has like this, you know, this sort of slow motion fantasy kind of feel, like the Caribbean cruise line. - You know, I like it so far. Go on, Nia. - And, and. - And? - But it's not fantasy. It's real. - Yeah, it's real. So we shoot it like raw and grainy. - But it's escaping reality. It's escaping unemployment, drugs, crime. - What does this have to do with the whole basketball thing? - [Nia] Because they're looking for opportunity. - Right, and we shoot it raw, but we use bright, happy colors. - But they're not happy. That's why they're drinking. - Ha ha. - Larry, do you think what we're doing is right? - You don't have to like it, Nia, you just have to sell it. That's all you guys came up with? - Yeah. - Shit, I thought you were gonna smoke us on this. - Why, 'cause I'm Black? - Well, you are, you know. - Charlie. - Sorry if I offended you. - Look Nia, there's no reason to get defensive, if you can't get it, you can't get it. - Just doesn't feel right to peddle cheap liquor to kids and welfare cases. - Well, look, young lady, this is an ad agency, not the fucking NAACP. And if you got a problem with that, you don't belong in the goddamn business. Our job is to convince Hilkner that we can sell their beer, and we've got less than a week to do it and we better do it, or we're gonna see $60 million walk out the fucking door. Charlie, Nick, I want something more high concept than that piece of shit music video by morning. Matt, Nia, I want this basketball thing fleshed out and finished by this afternoon at 5:30, got it? - Got it. - Nia? Nia? Well? - I don't like it. Larry. Maybe you're right, maybe I don't belong here. You know what? I quit. ♪ One day ♪ A day like no other - Nickel, dime.

I got me the invite to your bridal shower. It's co-ed. - I'll see if Ted has anyone in his office we can set you up with. - Yay. - Oh me, I almost forgot. The bridesmaids dresses are ready. - Good. - And if you need any help with the dress or anything. I know you just quit. - You're so sweet. No, Jen, I'm fine, really. I think this is the best thing I've done in my life, because I've been doing a lot of thinking. - Yeah? - And I've decided to write a novel. - A novel? - As in like a book? - Yeah. Well, you know how I wanted to be a writer in college, You know, and I got those, I got those poems published in that literary magazine. - Yeah, but those were poems. - And that was college. - Oh man, come on you guys. I wrote copy. How hard can it be to write a book? I found some notes on a novel I was writing about my parents living in Greenwich Village in the 60's. I just need to do a little research. What? Mom, how many times do I have to tell you I'm fine? And we don't have to go through this all over again, do we? Look, they want me. - I am tired of hearing about they this, they that. You are the only one responsible for your success, Nia. - Yeah, but I wanna do it on my terms. Look, I let you talk me outta being a writer in college. I will not let you do it again. - Fine. - Can we please get on with this interview? - Fine. It's your life. - Okay, like I said earlier, I wanna use yours and dad's marriage for material for my book. So just tell me whatever thoughts come into your head, okay? I already interviewed dad. - How is he? - Don't listen to your mother. You did what was right. - [Nia] I hope so. - What are you talking about? They were asking you to exploit your own people. - Yeah, but if this book thing doesn't work out, I only have enough money saved for a couple of months, if I fast. - Who said it would not work out, huh? You're finally doing what you wanna do on a terrific subject. I wish you could have lived during the 60's. I mean, it was a time of great change in this country. I think this must be the tape. - Oh no, Dad, it's fine. I'm all set up. Can we just do this? - I just wanna show you a little bit of this documentary on the underground weatherman. It'll give you a feeling for the period, huh? Show you what, oh! - Dad, I'm blushing. - I'm sorry. Shit, wrong tape. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - Dad's fine. - What can I say about the 60's? Things were a mess. - Oh, it was great. We were conscious, we were active. We were, we were getting high and listening to some of the best music ever written. - Your dad and I met at a civil disobedience workshop. - We fell in love instantly. - I had no idea what the hell I was doing. I got pregnant. And you know, I couldn't be another Black unwed mother. - We thought our love would be an example to the world. - You were a beautiful baby. You looked like your grandmother. - You were gorgeous. You looked like my Uncle Marty. Those were the golden days. Our own little Camelot. - It was a nightmare. We had no money. Harvey was always working for some lost cause. I had to drop out of law school. - While your mother desired social change, at heart, she was very bush bourgeois. [Mom laughing] - Now he wanted us to move to a commune upstate. You know, I wasn't having any of that free love crap. - Your mother was the only woman I ever truly loved. - I have no regrets. I have you. And hey, who knows? Maybe you will be a great writer like Toni Morrison. - You're gonna be a great writer. Like Norman Mailer. [laughing] Huh? [buzzing amplifier] [electric guitar playing] [electric guitar playing] [knocking on door] - Oh, hi. Was that you dancing? - I was stomping. - Well, I was really kind of grooving on that beat, huh? - Well, could you just tone it down a bit please? - The landlord said I could play as loud as I want from 10 to five weekdays. Listen, did you just, did you just move in here or something? Because I've been doing this for a while. - Ah, well, I used to have a job to go to. Great, this is a nightmare. How am I supposed to write? - What are you writing? - A novel. - Cool. About what? - About nothing when I'm being aurically tortured. It's like you're strangling barnyard animals in there or something. - That's it. Thank you. Moo. [electric guitar playing] - [Renee] Don't see much future in this room. Well, that guy's looking at you. - [Nia] He'd better just look someplace else. - I mean, what are two good-looking sisters like us hanging out in some workshop on a beautiful Saturday afternoon. You can't tell me you wouldn't rather be in the park with a man. - Well, yes, of course. But you know, right now I'm trying to focus on this book. The stuff I was writing about my parents is lot harder than I thought. It's weird. When I was little, when they were still together, I never really thought of them as being so different. I'll never forget the last time that we all went to the zoo. I remember feeling so happy and safe and secure. At least that's like how I'd like to remember it. The very next day they told me they were getting a divorce. - I remember what a sad little thing you were when you came to your grandma's. Took me two weeks to get you to come out and play. - Couldn't resist you riding around on that big wheel. - You know what? I'm glad we came. It's good to see you get in touch with your identity. - Please don't start with that identity crap, okay? - Come on, you know what I mean? It's understandable with your father and everything you'd be a little disoriented. - I'm oriented. Look, I am oriented. And I came here to learn about writing not to have some self-righteous, self-important Associate Professor of African American Studies. - Excuse me. - Teach me how to be Black. - Hey, I'm Professor Lewis Mercer, and I will be leading this workshop today, so welcome. Historically, whites have supported the depiction of us as Aunt Jemimas, Mandingos, welfare mothers, and heartless gun-totin' niggers. So now, it's up to us to tell some different kind of stories. And often there's gonna be some stuff that the whites may not want to hear. But if you continue to listen to the white man's voice when they tell you, and he will tell you that your tone is too angry or your language is too coarse, or you're not marketable enough. Now for those of you who are suffering from the delusion of inclusion, and for those of you who will walk right out this door and continue to listen to the voice of the white man, I will tell you that you would never be able to write anything that truly captures the essence of who we really are. Henry Lewis Gates recently wrote about this brother who used to be a book critic down at the New York Times. This brother thought he could fool everybody by passing for white. He thought that by doing this, this he would become a writer. This writer, but not a Black writer. Well, the only fool was him. He ended up writing nothing at all. This brilliant, articulate man suffers writers' block his whole life, because he would not and could not embrace his Blackness. We must fully embrace who we are. We must fully embrace who we are. Whether we are high yellow, blue, Black, red, bone, chocolate mocha, purple, Black, pecan, olive, cafe au lait. Like it or not, we are one people. Any questions? You're very welcome. - I just wanted to say how inspirational your lecture was. - Yeah, it was really, really great. - Thanks. Are you sisters writers? - Well. - Yeah, I'm a writer. - Oh, what are you working on? - A novel. - Oh really, what about? - It's kind of a a 60's counterculture kind of thing. - Oh, huh. Well, on the Panthers? - Well. - What you should read, Wretched of the Earth. It's one of the books I recommended. - Oh, I read that in college. It was- - Well, the bunch of us are gonna grab a bite to eat and continue the discussion if you want to join us. - Oh, I'd love to. - Yeah. Oh, hi Dave. - God, it's so good to see you. How are you? - I'm okay. - I'm just killing time before my African drumming class. It's got this really great vibe. It really just releases all this energy. I gotta go. - Oh, well. - Perhaps another time. - Yeah, we can discuss the books. - So how's that book coming? Sorry. - Should have guessed it was Mr. Put on This Planet to Make My Life Miserable. - Inspiration? - Research. - You know, you still haven't told me what your book's about. - God, you're annoying. - Am I annoying? Let me give you a hand. - You forgot to pay. - Oh, well I kinda do this borrow thing with him in exchange for playing at their family events. I'm a lot cheaper than a karaoke machine. - It's one way to make a living. - Well, it's pretty much just for kicks. Actually. I'm a classical composer. - Classical? I never would've figured you for classical. - Well, I'm just finishing this piece for this composer-in-residence program in Philly. - Ah, so you'll be leaving soon. - I better be, my grant money's running out. - I can take those. - There you go. - Thanks. - You know, you still haven't told me what your book's about. I thought maybe you're just one of those people who just can't talk about their work. - If you really must know, I'm writing this thing about the Black Panthers. - Black Panthers. - [Nia] Jennifer? No, no. Roberta. Yeah, that's nice and strong. Roberta basked in the comfort of their comradery, in the glow of their optimism to create a better life out of the hostile streets of the ghetto, in the warmth. - You all said, be quiet. - Well, you know, I always pictured you doing like a Grisham type thing, but set in an ad agency, you know, like, like sexy female copywriter has to take on the corporate giant, and keep them from brainwashing the world, kind of thing. - Okay well, I just feel it's really important for me to write about my experience as an African-American. - Yeah, but the Panthers, I mean, that's not exactly your experience. The only Huey Newton you grew up on was, that Huey Newton and the News guy on MTV. - Okay, collective experience. I took this amazing African American writer's workshop. The professor was so profound. He was so inspiring and include in. - Oh, I see he made quite an impact. - Not like that. - Oh, no? - No. - Well then stop glowing. People are gonna think you're a lava lamp. - I take it you're a regular. - Hey, I'm just trying to get us a table. I'm not the one running off with my professor. - Oh God, you never let up do you? It's not like I'm even gonna see the guy again. - Why don't you call him up? [laughing] You called him. - Okay, yeah, I did. I called him. He didn't call me back. - Don't worry, he'll call. - What? What you looking at me like that for? - I was just, I was just noticing your hair. It looks great, I've never seen you wear it like that before. - Thanks. You know, I'm just letting it go natural, you know. Part of the new me. I'm tired of all this yuppie crap. - Oh, do you, you want a drink? - Yeah, what chardonnays do you have by the glass. - You wanna try it? - Uh uh. No. - Come on, you want, listen, you want to be a writer, you gotta experience things, you know? I mean, Hemingway smoked cigars, and Kerouac and those guys, they smoked anything they could get their hands on. I mean, you won't even dance. - Oh, I'm a terrible dancer. I quit aerobics cause I was always that person going the wrong way. You try being the only Black person in class and going the wrong way, it's embarrassing. - You don't need rhythm to smoke a cigar. - All right, give it. - Yeah? - Yes. - All right. - All right, don't inhale, right? - No, no, no. You just want to, just take the smoke into your mouth for a second, savor the flavor, right? And breathe out. - It's pretty cool. I had a lot of fun tonight. - Yeah. All this time we worked together, we never really hung out like this. - Well, working those insane hours, it was kind of hard to have a social life. - Yeah. - Although I guess it never really stopped you. - Oh, if I knew you were jealous of my life of sin and debauchery, I would've corrupted you sooner. - Excuse me. - Sorry. [soft piano music] I feel weird. I'm pretty sure we shouldn't be doing this. - I've waited for a long time for this. [romantic jazz music] [traffic passing] - Goodnight. - Goodnight. [soft jazz music] - [Lewis On Answering Machine] Hi Nia, it's me, Lewis. Yeah, I'll be down to get together. Call me, peace. [answering machine beeping] Hi Nia, it's me Lewis. Yeah, I'll be down to get together. Call me, peace. [answering machine beeping] Hi Nia, it's me Lewis. Yeah, I'll be down to get together. Call me, peace. - Patience waits for them to cut the budget when they need to cut the bullshit. She's waiting for all the truth to fly from out the pulpits. Patience somehow will be at her wits end, and still give motherfuckers some slack. Well, hey, ain't that patience over there? Why is she laying on her back? She's removed all her clothes and parks her propped up legs, and opens her virginal lips to speak to me, you see. If patience is to hope for change, and to wait for change of mind, I'm afraid you're out of luck. 'Cause see, my name was Patience the Virgin, but now, I'm fucked. [Nia clapping] [audience snapping] - Oh, I can't believe I clapped, that was so embarrassing. And is that some new thing I don't know about, snapping instead of clapping? - No, no, no. They just do that to keep the neighbors from complaining about the noise. - Oh. Oh and Laquisha. She was so. - Loquacious. - Yeah. - So is this it? - Yes, I can't believe you haven't been here before. You're gonna love it. I'll have the ribs with peas and rice, and the collard greens. Thank you. - Well, I, I'll have the house salad with a small food bowl. No cottage cheese please. - So, what are you on a diet? - No, I'm a vegetarian. - You should have said something to me. - No, it's cool, it's cool. - Yeah, I don't normally eat like this, you know, with all the cholesterol and everything. - So, what do you think of the workshop? - I thought it was really inspirational. - Huh, I'm surprised, especially after what you said to your friend. - Oh, I had a feeling you may have heard that. - Yeah, you should have have seen your face when I introduced myself to the class. It was pretty funny, ma'am. - Oh, it's just that my friend Renee's always giving me shit about having an identity problem, and I'm kind of sensitive to that thing. My father's white. - Oh really? How long has he been that way? - And, being biracial, you know, people always wanna put this zebra Oreo crap on you. - Yeah. And shit is bad enough as it is, without your own bringing you down, right? - Yeah. - I certainly hope you like red. - Oh, I do. - Good. - Man, look at all these books. And they're all so organized. I just got all these new books and they're all over the place. - Did you get around and reading any of those books I recommended? - Uh huh. - Uh huh. Which ones? All of them. - All of them. - Yeah. - All of them? So when do you have any time to write your book on Black Panthers, right? - Yeah. Yeah. I haven't really gotten a feel for it yet though, you know. But. - Well, maybe you should write something a little bit more contemporary. I mean, I'm not trying to tell you what to write or anything, but there are plenty of issues now that you can address. - Yeah? - Oh, yeah. - Think so? - Yeah, know so. As a matter of fact, you can address one issue with me. [Nia flustered] - I don't, I don't, I don't dance. - Follow. [romantic jazz music] Okay. For someone who says they can't dance, you should know how to move baby. - I think I must have caught the spirit or something. For a while there I think I was even speaking in tongues. Oh, I bet I woke your neighbors. - Trust me, they ain't never heard nothing like that. Ever. - Walk me home. - Oh, come on baby. I brought you to this stop, I'm gonna be late. - I think the kids deserve a day off from school. - I'm gonna be late for work. [truck engine running] - I hope this doesn't. Nope, Nia, don't gimme the let's be friends routine, okay? I wrote the book on that. I should have thrown it out. [phone ringing] Hey. Yeah, I don't know, the thing starts at nine. Oh, you should go, it's for a good cause. It's save the whales. No, it save the children, save the children, yeah. It's whatever, we're saving somebody, right? Okay. I'll see you. - [Nia] At last I don't have to worry about you sitting at home alone. - So, so you're happy with this guy, right? - Yeah. - All right, then be happy. Look, I knew what I was getting myself into when I used my powers of charm and persuasion to take advantage of you in a weakened jobless state. - God. - But that doesn't mean I can't be jealous. [pop music] - You will come with me to Jen's shower, won't you? - I'll try. - You will. [Lewis laughing] - Okay, I will. I will, but you know, it's tough to get me to go to the shower. I think I might, kind of, you know. - What? - I think I kind of like you. - Well, I think I kinda like you, too. [group laughing] - Oh, glasses. - Look inside. You stick those in the freezer and use them as ice. Isn't that great? - Nancy, they're great. [laughing] - [Speaker] Only one. [acoustic guitar music] [group murmuring] - Baby, I gotta go. My friend Malik's got some, some things he wants me to look over. - Okay. - Thanks. Goodbye, Jen. - Hey? - What? What, he can't go help a friend? You helped me today. - She's got a point. - I still can't believe he left. - I didn't even get a chance to talk to him, but he seems absolutely adorable. - Jen, do you think I could bring him to the wedding? - He barely lasted an hour at the shower. - Don't you think it's a little bit soon? I mean, what if you guys break up and then there's some guy I barely even know in my wedding photographs. - You'll get to know him and he's wonderful. You know what he did this morning? He brought me buckwheat pancakes in bed. [laughing] - That is sweet. Isn't that sweet? - Yeah. - Okay. Okay, he can come. - Thank you. And the guy from Ted's office, he'll be here. I still can't believe he didn't come. - So how's the Panther thing coming along? - You know, I've decided to do something a little bit more contemporary, you know, something closer to home that I can really relate to. It's about a woman who reclaims her power from the street. Soquisha. [hip hop music] No, Shoquisha. No, I got it, Shokay. Shokay. Walks to the beat of the music blaring from car stereos, to the beat of the subway roaring under her own feet, to the beat of the shrill siren shrieking in the distance. Every step bringing her closer, closer to the motherfucker that had gunned down her man on the street. You. Yeah, I said you. - What the fuck you want, huh bitch? Huh? What the fuck you roll up in my game for, huh? - Uh, I'm sorry. Thought you were somebody else. - [Lewis] Nia. - I'll be right there. [drumming] At least one of us can work. - Tada. - Looks great. - Not bad, huh? - Thank you, baby. - God, how can you write with all this noise? - I'm getting used to it. Would you spell motherfucker with an A or AH at the end. - With an A. You wanna get rid of some of these albums? This, Grateful Dead? - No. Wait a minute, what are you doing? Why are you putting Brooks after Baldwin? What about Beauvoir or Becket? - They go with the non-African American literature. - You're segregating my books? - Yeah, it's easier to find shit if you keep all that other stuff on a separate shelf. - Wait, stuff? Stuff, you're calling Dostoevsky, stuff? I'm sorry, last time I checked he had written a masterpiece or two. - Well, personally, I've read enough of that white male canon Catcher in the Rye bullshit in high school. I mean, what does Holden Caulfield's rich teen angst have to do with our experience anyway? I mean, there's nothing phony about dodging bullets. - Our experience? I grew up in the suburbs. We only had serial killers and date rapists. - Why are you taking this? Why are you making this such a big deal? - I do not want to separate my books. For years they've been getting along just fine. Oh, no, no. [women laughing] - I'll get the car. - Okay. Lewis is quite a catch. - Well, he's not a tuna. - Oh, he's articulate. He's handsome. He's on the tenure track at City College. - Okay, he's great. He's not perfect. He has issues. - Lewis is a fine young man, dear. Well, Renee definitely seems to think so. - Nothing major. He can be a little close minded sometimes. I dunno. I'll get him to change, open him up to new experiences. - The only thing you can change about a man baby is his shoes, and that's only if you are putting them on for him. - Dad! - Hi. - Where is your father with that damn car? - It's nice to finally meet you, Lewis. - And you. - This is such a coincidence. - I'm sorry, I've really gotta go. - Bye mom. - All right. Goodbye. - It's really nice to see you. - Okay, Harvey. - [Speaker] Hey Harvey. - Hey, hey, how are you? - [Speaker] Great. - God, your mother just looks great. She really never seems to age. - She has that lovely dark skin. You too. I love your hair. - Yeah, it's really nice like that. - Thanks. - Hey, why don't you kids come over to the apartment? We can order from that chicken place you like. - Lewis and I are vegetarians. - When did you become a vegetarian? Okay, we'll do Chinese. - Okay. You're coming, Renee? - Yeah, if you want me to. - For weeks I've been trying to get together with you. I said please bring around your new boyfriend. - Come on, Dad. This is the first time I met your new girlfriend. - I just met her Tuesday. - What happened to Juanita, or Yolanda? What do you do, lurk around the United Nations? - Now now, just be happy your poor father can still get it up. Oh, come on. You know, I've never let my sex life come between the two of us. - Dad, I've just been really busy trying to write the book. - Yeah, but you have time to bring him up to your mom's. Don't tell me he hasn't been up there. - It was her birthday. - All I'm saying is, you have time to bring him up there, you have time to bring him over here. Look, look, for God's sake, he's a Professor of African American studies. I'm a civil rights attorney. I have more in common with him than your mom sitting up there in Westchester with her fancy house, her garden club. - Okay okay, dad dad dad, okay. How's this? I saw mom twice. I'll see you twice. That fair? It's ridiculous, I'm measuring out my love in visits. - I, I just want to see you more, Nia. I don't know, maybe it's me, but I get the feeling that you're gravitating more to your mom. - No, no, no. That's not true. - Well I, i feel left out and I just miss you. - Okay. If it'll make you feel any better, I'll see you three times. - Okay. Just don't tell your mom. [chuckling] Let's go back. - Race, race, Americans are obsessed with race. In France, we don't have these problems. - Oh, come on. - Yeah, what about the Arabs? - [Harvey] Now let's not digress. - Here we go again. - How can you say that Blacks were better off during segregation? - Well, for one, many of us had our own businesses, our own institutions. We were discoverers of cities, inventors. And look at what we have now. War zones littered with fast food joints, corner liquor stores, discount food chains, and crack addiction, all in what were once thriving communities. - Yeah well, you just don't know. You weren't there, you can't remember. You're living in a fantasy world. I mean, you, you couldn't even choose where to take a piss back then. And if you could, it was at the back of the bus. And until people, Black and White, including me, fought for civil rights in this country, choice. Choice is power. - Well, sir, with all due respect to your contributions to the 60's, Black people have been contributing things on their own to this world for a long time, like civilization. And I think at this time that we've had our own institutions, our own economy, our own art, our own university, for us, by us, instead of eating the scraps off of White America's table. - We live in a country, not a vacuum. We'd only become more marginalized. - This, this young lady. This is what you should be writing about. - Can't be any more marginalized than we are now. - So you're trying to tell me that all our efforts were in vain. - No, all I am saying is that integration hasn't worked. Oh, well, maybe for a few who've managed to slip through the cracks, but not for the many. [bluegrass music] - Hey, get the hell away from there, huh? Can't you read? It says whites only. You best get to that nigger station three miles back. - Look here you piece of trailer park trash. I'm going in there, and nothing's gonna stop me. Oh, you're supposed to stand up to him, you idiot. [mournful orchestral music] - Nia. - Hey. - Hey. - It's beautiful, Joe. Is it finished? - Yeah. Pizza. There you go. - We're gonna have to go celebrate. - Maybe we should wait till I hear back from that program. - Oh, come on, you should be psyched. - It's part of the process. So how's your writing? - I'm probably gonna have to go back into advertising. - No way. - Yeah, way. I can't write. I've gone through like four different topics and I can't seem to get a feel for anything. - You gotta go with it, you gotta feel it. - All I feel is confusion. - Well, that's great Nia, now just go with that. - I mean, I've got all this Black-White crap to deal with. - What the hell's being biracial have to do with anything? - I don't know a goddamn thing about the Black experience and I'm Black. - Well, why don't you write about that. You feel that. Write about your alienation. Nia, it doesn't matter what you write, just as long as you feel it. - It's easy for you to say, you're. - I'm adopted. Listen to me, you just have to forget about all that stuff, and you have to listen to your own voice, because if you don't, you're gonna make yourself miserable. Everybody has their own voice, Nia, just like every instrument has its own sound. Tambourine. Tambourine is a different sound than tambora. - Yeah, well Joe, I wish it were that simple. - Close your eyes. - Why? - I want you to, I want you to listen to the sound of these instruments, and I want you to tell me which one you think sounds like you. [Nia laughing] - What? - [Joe] Close your eyes. - Oh fine. - Ready? - Thanks. Yeah. that sounds like me. - I'm just kidding. - No, it's got too much of a beat thing happening. [flute music] No, that's too sedate. If you haven't noticed, I'm pretty high strung. [eastern music] That's not bad. [acoustic guitar music] Yeah, I like that. It's graceful. Still upbeat though. Sweet. A little complicated. Sounds almost Celtic. Yeah. Okay, I'd say that's me. What is it? - It's a Kora. It's from Senegal. Wanna try it? - Well, I warn you, I'm not very musical. - Let me show you. - What do I do? - You gotta a pluck the strings. There you go. [both chuckling] [person laughing] [rap music] [Lewis laughing] [rap music] - Let me get you a quick. What's up girl? [laughing] - Hey, you made it. - How you doing? Hey, let let me introduce you to my lady, Nia. Nia, this is Loquesha. - Hi. I saw your show, really powerful. - Thanks. I try to tell it like it is, right? Listen, did I tell you that BET wants me to put something together for them? - Oh, get out of here, girl. - Yeah. - Right, my gracious. You know, Nia's writing a book. - Really? - Maybe you should let Loquesha look at some of your stuff. She can help you. She definitely know what's going on. - Well. - All right, hey hey, come on. ♪ Skelly in the streets with the rest of the kids ♪ ♪ Now we're grown - Are you trying to say I don't know what's going on? - Huh? - I know what's going on. - What? - I know what's going on. ♪ Well with the plot in the shade ♪ ♪ But Allah smiled - What do you think? - You look great. - I look terrible. - You look beautiful. [Jen crying] - I'm fat. [crying] I'm gonna look like a giant moray floating down the aisle. I could be in the Macy's Day Parade. - Come on, you look gorgeous. Ted is gonna faint when he sees you in that dress. - [indistinct] You just kinda sat there. - I was overcome by how beautiful you look. - You think I'm making the wrong decision. Maybe I am making the wrong decision. [crying] I love him. - You're not making wrong decision. You two are perfect for each other. You think? - I know. You're gonna have a very, very happy life together. - What's the matter with you? You look kind of drawn and, and thin. - It's nothing. - Something's wrong. Come on. It's like you never even confide in me anymore. - Jen, I don't wanna bother you. You have the wedding. - Bother me. It's like I hardly ever see you anymore. I miss you. - I miss you, too. It's just that I'm, I'm having trouble with my writing. I don't know, Lewis. I don't know, I feel like I'm getting so caught up in trying to be what he wants me to be, that I'm losing sight of who I am, you know. I'm never gonna be a Renee. I think that's what he wants. - He doesn't want Renee. He wants you. - I don't know. I think Renee likes him. - Renee is lonely. You need to set her up with someone. - This pork chop is great. Here, you gotta try some of this. - [Renee] Good. - [Matt] How are those grilled vegetable plates? - [Nia] Great. - Oh, so Lewis, Nia tells me that you're, you're a professor at City College? - Yeah, I'm up for tenure next year. - Wow. I mean, you're young. - Well, I did my master's and doctoral studies in three years. - That fast? Where'd you go to school? - Howard. - Oh man, great school. I know tons of people who went to Harvard. - No, No. I said Howard. Know anybody there? - No, I don't think so. - Now listen, so if you guys aren't too tired, I got us on the guest list over at Metro. - Really? This saw a picture of David Bowie admiring that place in New York Magazine. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. - I think it could be a lot of fun. - I have never met anyone who has so much fun in my life. He always seems to be having a blast. Awesome time or something. Just one okay time, he'll probably be so bummed out he'll fall to pieces, commit suicide. - Would you just lighten up please? - Can we go home now? - We can't just go. I don't think they'll miss us. - You have a car? - Yeah. - What kind? - A Saab convertible. I mean it's, you know. - That's yuppie. - Yeah. - You think Renee liked him? - No, I get the feeling that you do. - Yeah, as a friend. - Look, Nia, you are the one with the thing for white boys, all right? - What? Listen, I judge people by the content of their character. - Yeah, mm-hm, like the little drummer boy that I met after the workshop with all the energy and the vibes and shit. - You mean Dave? - Yeah Dave, you gonna lay here and tell me there was nothing going on between you two? Huh? You didn't. You didn't. - What? - Not with that little nasty, touchy feely motherfucker with the Birkenstocks? He probably walk some road less traveled, to run with the wolves and shit, Nia. - It was in college. Will you bring your Black ass back to bed? - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. How you expect me to get it up now? I cannot get it up now, Nia. No. No no. - What's up girl? - Hey. - Well you're upright and early. So, how did the rest of the date go? - She is just dying to know. - You better get ready for this. So, we're on our way to Metro, and he's going on about some trip to Nepal. I mean, this guy can talk. All of a sudden I notice people staring at us, wondering, girl, what you doing with that white guy? All of a sudden I start to feel really self-conscious. And then later he's smoking this cigar, and I'm looking at his hands, and they're small with these short fingers. And you know what they say about white men with short fingers. And then I saw him dance, and that was it. [laughing] So I just left. - You just left? - It was so funny, he was. - He would've never been able to satisfy his sister like you anyway. - Right? Bottom line is, I'm not attracted to white men. - But you didn't have to blow him off like that, Renee. He's my friend. - Just relax. She just did to him what white people been doing to us for years? See and flee, come on. - But what has he ever personally done to you? That's ridiculous. - Don't entertain that, she wouldn't understand. - Why wouldn't I understand? What, am I not Black enough or some bullshit? - Look, I better go. - Yeah, I think you better. - All right, Renee. - You know, maybe you should go off and be with a real Black woman like Renee since you two seem to understand each other so well. Next thing you know, you'll have some secret handshake or some bullshit like that. - You know, you got some nerve to be jealous of Renee, after the way you were leering at Matt last night. - I was not leering. - I mean if he's so nice, why the hell don't you go out and be with him, instead of siccing him on poor little Renee? You're the one with the thing with white boys. - Why does everything have to come down to race with you? Why can't people just be people you know, like humanity? - Well, the day white people fully embrace the humanity of Black people in this country, race won't matter to me. We're lucky to be alive, we're not doing life in prison. - Oh God. The only thing you'll get for life is tenure at City College. - Well, the only thing you know about being Black is what you've read in a damn book. It's no wonder you can't write. - What? - You heard me. - That's it. - Oh, well take your cute little running shoes and leave then. But I suggest you take off those white-colored glasses and face the truth. - Truth? You couldn't see the truth unless it came wrapped to you in a Kinte cloth. You're so busy being condescending with all your Marcus Garvey, back to Africa, bullshit. You know what though? You wouldn't last a week in Africa. There's no tofu or buckwheat pasta. You'd be eating hyena. - You know what your problem is? I'll tell you what your problem is. - I'm sure you will. Yeah, I know, I'm gonna tell you what your problem is. Your problem is, is you can't handle being with a real brother. - Lewis, you're gonna have to give it up. 'Cause I know why you're with me and not Renee. - Oh. - I looked through your photo albums. You only date light skinned women. [somber instrumental music] Got an interview at Match and Marlowe, Wood and Walker Tompkins. Let's face it though, I mean it's really, I think it's really the best move for me, you know? I was a better copywriter than I was a writer writer. - And Lewis? - We haven't spoken in two weeks. - Yes! [Nia laughing] She's back. Hey, hey, I'm canceling all my plans. I want to take you out. Where do you wanna go? Where do you wanna go? - I don't know. - Where do you wanna go? You name it. - What you say. This is great. - You haven't touched your asparagus. - Mm. - Have a bit of this. - If I ever eat another vegetable, I will scream. - This is a perfect haven for the carnivorously indulgent. - Mm-hm. - Yeah, I think yours is still kicking. - Don't, you'll make me feel guilty. [romantic piano music] - I'm really glad they built this bridge. - It's really beautiful, isn't it? - You know, a hundred and something years ago, I would've had to row you home. - A hundred and something years ago, I would've had to row you home. - I would've stolen your oars. - Then we would've been stranded. - That's the whole idea. [late night jazz] - This is quite an impressive resume. - Thank you. - May I ask you why you left your former employer? - I had a problem. Well, not really a problem, it was more of a difference of opinion in the way certain accounts were being handled. It was not a big deal. - No big deal. It indicates on your resume that you have been out of work for three months. - Yeah, I took some time off to write a novel. - [Interviewer] I see. - It's something I've always wanted to do. - [Interviewer] And why do you want to get back into advertising? - Just not very creative, in that way. My mind just ran a blank. I mean, I tried a number of different things and nothing felt right. Well, at least I know now what I don't want to write. I guess that's kind of a step. Maybe if I eliminated all of the things that I don't wanna write, I'd find out what I could write. But who has that kind of time? Bottom line is I'm dying to get back into advertising. - Thank you, thank you for coming in. [knocking on door] - It's open. - Nia? - [Nia] I'll be right out. - Jesus. So where have you been this last couple of days? What are you up to tonight? - I got a party. - [Joe] Change your plans, I got in. - You got in. That's great! - Not only that, but also I got a job doing a score for a film. Just a little momentary case of the jitters when I thought I wouldn't get the grant. Come on, let's celebrate. - Sorry Joe, but I can't. - [Joe] Okay, what about tomorrow? - I have my friend's wedding tomorrow. [horn honking] - I see. - I gotta go. Okay? - You look beautiful. - Thanks. We're not really gonna ride with the top down, are we? - Huh? - I mean, my hair, the wind. - It's gonna be fine, it'll be fine. - I told you to put the top up, look at my hair. - Look. Oh, I think it looks really cool. I like it. - Cool? - Yeah. Are you crazy? I look like I've been struck by lightning. - No, you're gonna, listen, you're gonna be the most beautiful woman at the party. Come on, let's go in. - No, like this? No way. - Okay, well I think if you want, I have some, I have some twine. If you wanna, you could tie it up. - Well, I was writing a book, but now I'm getting back into advertising. - You were writing a book? You have any representation for the book at all? - No, I don't. - Really? 'Cause I'm looking for film material. Black women's films are doing big money at the box office. - Oh, well, I only have a couple of rough ideas. - Really? Well listen, as long as you have something more than 50 words, we can turn it into a screenplay. Do me a favor, call me. I can make it happen. Money. - 50 words, why not one word? Shit. I've been recycling that in movies for years. - Hey, isn't this a great party? - Great. - Hey, Nia, will you cheer up? You're gonna get another job. Oh, I want to introduce you to Katrina. - I was wondering when you were going to say hello, darling. - Hello. - Katrina, this is Nia. - I love your hairpiece. Is it Prada? - No. [laughing] - This is, this is Katrina's work on the walls. - It's part of my new series, I call it body fluids. - Aren't they great? - Yeah. Yeah. They've got a real aquatic feeling to them. - I mix my piss, shit, and blood into the paint to celebrate my rage. - Hey hey buddy, buddy. How you doing? Hey Nia, I hear you two guys are an item now, huh? - Hey Charlie, I thought you were on vacation. - I'm on vacation, but I'm in the city. I'm taking off tomorrow for Taos. Just came over to say hello to my new art director. [Charlie and Matt laughing] - Charlie's been assigned my new copywriter. Nia. Nia? - I can't believe you would work with that asshole. - Nia, you left. And then Nick took a job at Sherman and Shoal, what was I supposed to do? - Oh what, do you only have morals when it doesn't interfere with you having a good time? - I was gonna tell you. - When, when you guys open up your own agency? - We're not friends, we're not pals. We're just, we're just working together. - Yeah, but with that guy, Matt? He completely offended me. He's a racist. - Look, Charlie's just an asshole, period, okay? You're blowing this out of proportion, okay? We're just working together, it's just business. I mean, you gotta understand that, you're going back into advertising. - Oh no, I'm not, not anymore. I can't believe I even considered it. - Nia. - Fuck you, Matt. - Nia. [classical music] [phone ringing] - [Speaker] Hello? - Hi, is Lewis there? - [Speaker] Yeah, just, yeah, just a second. He's here. - Renee? [knocking on door] - [Lewis] Nia, come on. Look, I can explain everything. Come on, open up Nia. I took a cab, came all the way over here because you wouldn't answer the phone. Least you could do is answer the door. - How generous of you. I know you think taxis are a ridiculous waste of resources. - There's absolutely nothing going on between me and Renee, all right? Actually, all we were doing was sitting there talking about you. - Right. - The only reason she picked up my phone is because she paged one of her girlfriends. - I just shouldn't have called in the first place, okay? - But you did, and I'm glad you called. I missed you. I miss what we had, don't you? - Everything's all screwed up. - Why'd you call? Hmm? - Remember that guy that you talked about in your workshop? - So you're telling me that's what you called about? - Maybe I'm like him. Maybe that's why I can't write. - Nigger, he was passing for white. You're not doing that. - Maybe not exactly passing, but maybe there are sides of myself that I'm afraid to see, and maybe that's why I can't write. - Wait a second. I thought you were going back into advertising. What happened to that? - Where'd you hear that? Renee? - God damn it, forget about Renee. I came all the way over here to be with you, all right, with you. - I don't know. - You don't know. What you don't know? Nia, you are a strong, beautiful Black woman, all right? My grand Nubian princess, baby. Come on, don't you remember that? Don't know? Come on. Come on. [Lewis whistling] - Oh, there's my queen. - Good morning. - Sleep okay? - Mm-hm. - Good. There you are. - Oh, you didn't have to do that. - Oh, yes I did. Here you go. - Thank you. - Watch it, it's hot. - I got it. - So what time is this wedding? - Four o'clock. - Four o'clock? I'll tell you what, I'll meet you there. - Oh, you don't have to go. - No no, I insist. Hm. So I gotta go, I want to go. I have to go. With you. Just give me a minute, to pick up something nice. Don't be late. [phone ringing] - Hello? Matt. Matt, I can't talk right now. You told Larry, what? - Yeah, I told him, I told him I couldn't work with Charlie anymore, and if he had a problem with that, he could take his job and shove it. So he told me to shove it. Are you there? - Yeah. - I know you're still mad at me, but listen, I, Nia, I need to see you. - Yeah, but Matt, I can't see you right now. I've gotta go to the wedding. - Okay, I'll meet you there, and no buts, I just lost my job for you. - Matt. - I'll see you there, bye. - Matt! [church bell ringing] - Jen, I'm sorry I'm late. - It's fine. Just get in line. - You're back here. - You can't get behind me, I'm maid of honor. [muffled speaking] [wedding processional] - I can take over now. Thank you. - Great. - What's she doing here? - What do you mean, what am I doing here? Who invited you? - She did. - You did? - I did. - Why didn't, why didn't you tell me you're back together with this guy. - Back, what? What, you seeing this guy too? - Kind of. - [Matt And Lewis] Kind of? - What, after all this shit you told me about him. - Yeah, all right, so I was wrong, but I, I just quit my job for her. What have you ever done for her, man? - What have I done? What have I done? I've helped her come to terms with her Blackness, which is something you could never do, Matt. I mean, how do you expect your unemployed ass to provide for her anyway? You don't even have a job. - I'll get another job. - Oh yeah, just like that, right? - Yeah, just like that. - Man, what do you know what it's like being Black, Matt? Let alone understand a Black woman. - And you do? Jesus, man, you're like, everything you speak is in slogans. This is just a woman, all right? This is not a treatise on the plight of African American women in this society. But you think you understand her better than me, just because you share the same color skin? That's bullshit. I've known her longer than you, Lewis. I've known her for five years. I've seen her smile. I've seen her eyes when she got her first account. I've seen her cry when her mother said that she had to put her dog to sleep, so don't tell me I don't understand her. In fact, she told me that she'd like to take your pseudo Afrocentric bullshit and shove it up your ass. - Pseudo? Come on Nia, pseudo? - Matt. - Nia. - I can't go with you. - What? - Whoo, you heard her white boy. Come on baby, let's go. - Lewis, I can't go with you either. - Excuse me? - I'm sorry. - What, you're sorry, that's it? - You know this is fucked up, right? - I know, I know. I didn't mean to hurt anyone, okay, I didn't. Just if you could please try to understand. - I did try near, Nia. Yeah, I guess I am lucky I can get another job, right? - Maybe you're right. Maybe I should be with, with someone like Renee. - Come on Nia, we gotta go. We gotta go. - I'm sorry about what happened in front of the church. - I know. It's okay. - No, it's not today. It was supposed to be your day. I should have been there for you. - I just want you to be happy. [soft jazz music] [crowd murmuring] [drum roll] [group screaming] [group applauding] [group cheering] - Congratulations. - I'm sorry. No, I'm sorry. I was wrong to side with Lewis. I should have never let a man get in the way of our friendship. Now you know that nothing, nothing happened between us, okay? - Okay. Let's go get a drink or something. - Ooh, you remember that guy, the one that Jen's been trying to set me up with? We've been talking all night. He's amazing. We're going for a drink at the Saint Regents. - Oh, okay. - Yeah, you wanna go? - Oh, no, no. Go have fun. - Okay, bye. Bye bye, Nia. [somber orchestral music] [thunder rumbling] [rain falling] [solemn orchestral music] - Joe! Joe! - Oh, he's gone. - Gone, gone where? - He left tonight for Los Angeles to do some film gig. I'm subletting his apartment for six months. - Six months? - [Subletter] I can give him a message. - No, thanks. I'm Nia, If you need anything, I'm right upstairs. - Oh, you're Nia. Hold on. Here, Joe left this for you. I'm Connie. - Thanks. - [Joe] Nia, I hope you find your voice. Love, Joe. [sad orchestral music] [plucking the kora] [sad orchestral music] - Looking back, how could I have known as I stood waiting to cut across the street at Times Square that I had arrived at the crossroad. The world to me then was nothing as delicious as a melting pot or a salad bowl. More like a TV dinner with everything sticking to its own little compartment and me being the gravy oozing down the sides. But now with my feet planted firmly toward the direction of my chosen fate, I see in the faces of passing people my maternal ancestors bound in shackles, standing on the shore, weeping for the freedom they've lost. My paternal ancestors weeping for the freedom they have gained. And as I catch my reflection in the glass of a storefront, it's like I'm seeing myself for the first time. And what I see, I like. The end. [audience snapping] [audience clapping] [light instrumental music] [singing in foreign language]
