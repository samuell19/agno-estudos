My childhood was like a fairy tale. I was an only child with two doting parents that made sure my days were filled with beauty and lots of love. Until one day, my family of three became just me. My parents were on their way home and a car came head on into their lane, and that's when I went to live with my cousin's family in Sun Valley, Idaho, and spent my summers in Montana with my grandfather. Josh Lake was my first true love. Josh's brother, Sam, became like family to me. I threw myself into work and I had a career path all planned out, until once again, my plans were interrupted when my grandfather left me his ranch in Montana. Big Sky is not where I thought I'd end up. But my mother used to tell me when God closes a door, start looking for a window. I was too young to understand what she meant then, but, I'm beginning to. It might seem quiet here now, but it won't be long till this ranch comes to life again. Bright Star Ranch will be a place where kids can come for a week-long summer camp, have fun, and learn new social skills at the same time through equine therapy. As they take care of the horses, they begin to heal past hurts and learn to trust again. It's amazing what being around a horse can do for you. Good girl. Paisley. Anna, what're you doing? Me and mommy picked up my cake. Ah, is it chocolate? How did you know? It's my favorite. We were just coming back home from town and thought we'd stop in and see if he needed anything else for tomorrow. You bring the cake and the kids. I've got everything else. Oh, and let me know when you open up the registration for summer camp, I know it's gonna fill up fast. You're at the top of the list. Oh well, I'm happy to volunteer to cook or do whatever you need. Thanks, Cindy. Okay, Anna, say bye to Paisley. Bye, Paisley. Bye. See you tomorrow, Anna. What do we got? Please say yes. Please, please say yes. "Dear Ms. Sheridan, thank you for your recent application. We appreciate your interest in the Equine Grant Program. Unfortunately, at this time, the funding is not available. Please resubmit at the beginning of next calendar year." What are we gonna do girl? Can't wait till next year. Hey, Sarah. Good morning, Josh. We just got the new Foster client. Took you long enough. Well, thank you very much. I really wanted to showcase the brand's uniqueness, but identifying their core values. That's something that was really important to me. The concept has great energy. Thank you. Thank you all for your input. I really appreciate it. Nice job. Thank you very much. Yeah. Would you mind taking a look at a logo I've been working on? Absolutely. I'll swing by after lunch. Great. Thank you. Thank you. Hey, we got a lotta great feedback. What? Look what Mandy found. Well, this is my campaign. Yeah, sure looks like it. Um, but this is our competitor. Marcus, what are we gonna do? And you have no idea how that would've gotten out there? No, of course not. Well, until we find out who did it, I need you to take some time away from the office. Hang on. Just let me talk to Mr. Cooper. I can handle Mr. Cooper. Marcus, you know I had nothing to do with this. I do, but I have to think about our clients and what it looks like to them. Just lay low for a few weeks. We'll get it straightened out. Uh, okay, just let me know if there's anything I can do to help. What kind of person thinks that it's okay to take someone else's idea? Intellectual property can be hard to prove. I know, but if I just had a chance to talk to Mr. Cooper, I know that I could explain that I had nothing to do with it. I heard he's already starting to shop around for a new agency. I know. Marcus said he wants to handle it. I hope he does. I was thinking, as long as I have this time off, we could go on a little trip together? You're kidding, right? Well, you want me to meet your family? And how do you expect me to introduce you to my family? As my unemployed boyfriend? Uh, I'm not unemployed. I'm on suspension. Josh, it looks like it was you that stole the ideas. That's what people think? I think that we need to take a little break. You go on your trip, and while you're away we can decide what it is we both really want. I, I know what I want. Have a nice trip, Josh. "If you have something good in your life, don't let it go." ♪ I've been looking for someone ♪ 'Bout time you got some help out there. I found out I didn't get the grant today. Oh Paisley, I'm so sorry. I went ahead and applied for a loan at the bank. They said that the process should move pretty quickly. Well, if you need a reference have them give me a call. I will. But in the meantime, it can't hurt to start looking for some help. I'd hold out for one of those tall, dark cowboys. I don't care what they look like. Could be a cowgirl, as long as they know what they're doing and have some muscle. Oh maybe I should apply then, hm? Stop. That's Josh. Hello. Can I help you? Uh, yes, I'm driving up to Sun Valley, and my car started making some noises. Sun Valley. Oh, are you vacationing? Family. Oh, how nice. Yeah, uh, anyway, my, my phone doesn't get any service out here. Oh, that's not surprising. So, I was hoping I might be able to use your phone, make a call? Oh, you could, but let me get you a cup of coffee first. It's so cold out there. Thank you. Paisley, you want some whipped cream? There we go. Made a little heart for ya. Well, I tried. It's abstract. Paisley? Paisley Sheridan? Josh? Hi. It's, it's been a while, a long while. If I hadn't, if I hadn't heard your name. Yeah, not too many Paisleys. No. So you left Sun Valley? She's running Bright Star Ranch that her grandfather left her. Really? Good for you. Yeah. I guess you've been staying in touch with Sammy. A little bit, yeah. So you know when he got back from the service, he started volunteering as a fireman? Mm. Yeah, you can't get much more all-American than that, can you? No. No, you can't. Uh, the phone is in the back if you'd like to make your call now. What is wrong with you? Nothing. You barely said a word to him. Because I have nothing to say. He's not wearing a wedding band. You don't have to have anything to say, it's called small talk. You could ask him what he's doing now. Or you could ask him what he's doing for dinner. I don't care what he's doing. Uh, well, sounds like I'm not going anywhere. Nearest roadside assistance is three hours away and they said they can't get to me until the morning. Oh, that's too bad. I'm sure you're tired from all that driving. Oh no, I'll be fine. I think I'll call my brother, have him drive down from Sun Valley. - Oh... - Not from Sun Valley, not with these roads, it's not a good idea. Paisley has a room in their bunk house at the ranch. Uh, no, no, I, I don't. It says right there on your flyer, you know, room and board. Honestly, I can sleep anywhere tonight. Fine. I hope I wouldn't be imposing. Oh no, you're not imposing at all. Paisley's a wonderful host. She is. I really appreciate it. No problem. Let's go. Thank you. ♪ If nothing else ♪ I've been so sure that baby I belong ♪ ♪ Where you are Whose is that? It's mine. I thought you said it broke down. No, I, I said she was making weird noises. I couldn't just leave her on the side of the road. No, I don't suppose you could leave her there. Let me just grab my stuff. You two are ruthless. All's fair. In love and war. There's no love or war. Anything between Josh and me happened a long time ago. We haven't even talked since, for a good reason. We were only trying to help. Don't help so much next time. I came in to tell you he's leaving his car out front. Will you give the keys to the tow truck in the morning? Sure will. Thank you ladies. Good night. Good night. That child is just like her grandpa. Sweet as can be, and stubborn as a mule. She needs us, whether she knows it or not. Oh, I suppose. You gotta be kidding. What? This is your truck? Yeah, I thought about getting a little sports car, but it's not great for hauling hay. Probably not. Hop in. I really appreciate you giving me a place to stay and a ride. I was driving home anyway. Still, I appreciate it. It's really nice of you. I'm surprised you didn't fly. I needed to get out of town quickly. You rob a bank? It depends on who you talk to, I guess. I'm glad you're going home to visit. Good morning. I was beginning to think you were gonna sleep all day. Come on in, there's breakfast. Hey, do you have a phone I could use? It's on the table. Thanks. Hey, is there cell service anywhere around here? It's pretty spotty. Oatmeal? Thanks. I called Charlie to take a look at your car. So you gave up marketing and you're robbing banks now. Yeah, I felt like it was a more secure career choice. I always knew you had a bright future ahead of you. A competitor's commercial started airing that was uncannily close to one I'd been working on for the last six months. So, it looks like I stole their idea. Anyone that knows you would know you wouldn't do that. That's what I thought too. Hopefully though, it will all work out. It will. So you wanna turn this back into a working ranch? I wanna bring kids in for camps and teach them about horses and how to care for them. Wow. This is gonna be something special, I can already tell. Really? Yeah, I can tell just by the way you're talking about it. Thanks. You know this is gonna be a really big endeavor to take on by yourself. You ever thought about bringing on a partner? Even someone who could share in the expenses? So, I just applied for a loan. Once that goes through, I'll be able to hire plenty of help. I have to say, I'm really impressed. I still, I still think of you as the girl that... I'm not that girl anymore. I know. I know you're not that girl anymore. At least that girl could beat me in a horse race. Don't worry, I could still beat you. Yeah? Well, we're gonna have to take your word for it. You think you remember how to ride? Charlie? What's the news. Oh, yeah. I'll tell him. That was Charlie. You need a new alternator. When can she get it by? They'll order it today, it should be here tomorrow. I can rent a car and then return it on my way back and pick up my... Don't do that. You can stay here one more night. You sure that wouldn't be too much trouble? It's no trouble. Man. Wow, look at all of these. Please tell me this is you. You haven't changed a bit. What's this? I'm working on a new logo for the ranch. Are you kidding? Show me. It's nothing fancy, like what you do. Let me see it. Nice. Star Horse Ranch? No, uh, Bright Star Ranch. So if it were me, I would suggest something simple and really bright and that's... Not. Okay. What do you think of when you think of Bright Star Ranch? I'm not good at this. Come here. Let me show you something, come on. Get up. Come on. Okay, so, first things first, we're in this beautiful mountain setting, right? And the bright star. The sky here at night, it's... Magical. Yeah. May I? Come here. Have a seat. Okay, the greatest designs and ideas are the ones that are so simple and perfect that when people see them, they think to themselves, I should have thought of that. You don't want complicated. How 'bout that? If I had a little more time, I could play with it. I'm gonna tell myself you're a speechless, because my ego can't take much more. No. I really am, I'm speechless. Do you have any idea how long I worked on that horse? Uh, I'm sorry. I can... No. It's, it's perfect. I just can't believe you did it so quickly. Oh yeah, that's what I do. Or, or what I did, at least. The verdict's still out on that. They'd be crazy to let you go. Princess Anna will be here soon. Princess Anna? Princess Anna turns six today. Let me know what I can do to help. Hi, Paise. Sam, it's Josh. Josh, what are you doing at Paisley's? Well, my car broke down. I have to get a new alternator. So, I'm staying here. Was that her idea? I'd say it was mutual. Can I talk to her? Uh, she's busy. Sure you don't want me to just come pick you up? No, no, no. 'Cause then I'm gonna have to come back here tomorrow to grab my car anyway. All right. Tell Paise I said, hi. All right. I'll see you later. Okay, it's time for cake. No. Anna, don't you want cake? Well, they can't blow out candles without you. Is this the birthday princess? Why yes, this is Princess Anna. Her royal subjects are awaiting her presence so they may celebrate her sixth year of living. Fair maiden, I have traveled a great distance to find thee. Would you do me the honors of allowing me to escort you to the festivities? Wonderful. Right this way. Thank you. Bam, bam, and the princess, my fair maiden. Come on Daisy. He won't be here long. Don't get attached. Get attached to who? No one. I don't have time to think about anything but horses and bank loans. Paisley, you don't always have to be so strong. Paisley, can I get a picture with you two? Everybody smile. Oh, that's perfect. Say thank you to Miss Paisley and Mr. Josh. Thank you. We had a wonderful time. It was a lotta fun. Hey, I'm actually helping her with her social media. Would you mind tagging us in that photo? Sure, I have so many great photos of the ranch. I can share them with you if you want. That'd be great. - Come on. - Bye. Thanks for the help today. How are you attracting business? I put flyers up in local businesses, and when I can afford it, I'll place newspaper ads, but mostly word of mouth. People knew grandpa, so they still come. Why don't you let me help you, with social media, your website, I can create a marketing plan. I can't afford you. How do you know you can't afford me? I've got a good idea. And I need a ranch hand right now more than I need a marketing plan. So, just feed me for a few days. Let me stay in the bunk house. I'll even help out with some chores around the house. Josh, you can't do that. Yes I can. For the first time, I don't have to be anywhere else. No, I mean, you can't do that. You haven't been around a ranch for a long time. It's hard work. So I haven't been in a barn lately. Just get me some good work boots, I'll be ready to go. Why would you want to? 'Cause I need to keep it, that's all. Ooh, I like those. Try this one. All right, what do you think of this one? As a fashion statement? Why do you always give me such a hard time? You kinda make it hard not to give you a hard time. And then I guess what they say is true, clothes make a man. It's not just the clothes, Josh, and buying new ones doesn't change anything. Okay, when I was younger than Anna, just five years old, I asked Santa for a horse for Christmas. How did Santa do? Well, I woke up Christmas morning and I ran to the window, and standing right in the front yard was this gorgeous horse. So I ran out the front door, just yelling that Santa had brought me this horse, and then it took off. He ran away? Yeah. Well, he must've been wild and just wandered down from the preserve. Oh, no. Yeah, my parents had gotten me a bike. Anyway, just because I work at a desk now, instead of a pasture, I'm still the same. Okay, cowboy. Get this hat and I'll introduce you to Butch. Butch? Who's Butch? You'll see. This is Butch. He was wild, now he's tame as a kitten. Let's ride up this way, it's a nice view of the ranch. Whoa, whoa. Hey, I think I got service. Whoa. Butch, whoa, hang on. I, I, I just have to check my messages real quick. I thought you wanted to ride. This will just take a minute. Hey Marcus, it's Josh. I'm in Bozeman, Montana. The cell service is horrible. I'm in Big Sky Ranch. Whoa! Oh, come on. All right, I got you. You're good, you're good. Whoa, whoa. What is wrong with him? He's just letting you know he's not a desk. I've never been thrown from a horse before. Technically he didn't throw you. He just wanted your attention. Well, he got it. Hey, Paisley? - Yeah? - Whoa. Can we never talk about this again? Be still. Ah, I think Butch has it out for me. Butch just wants you to know who's in charge. Obviously, he is. You need better gloves. I think there's some of grandpa's out in the barn you can use. Thank you. Leave it on for a few days and it should be fine. You ready for dinner? What can I do? Nothing. I just put some cornbread in the oven. So we're just waiting on that. It does smell really good. But you've always been a good cook. Oh yeah? What did I cook? Don't you remember when you made me that really big Mexican dinner for my birthday, and uh, sopapillas for dessert. And you ended up in the emergency room with third degree burns. Yeah, but the food was really good, and it was very memorable. Hopefully tonight doesn't end at the hospital. That might as well be a million years ago. How have you changed? Let's see, since I was 16? I got my braces off. Okay. I went to college, and I got a job as head of human resources at SV Enterprises. That sounds pretty cushy. So what made you wanna leave? Yeah, it was nice. I didn't worry where my next paycheck was coming from. I had benefits and a 401k. That's very grown up. Then when grandpa died, he left the place to me and it just felt like I should do this. So I gave all that up and here I am. Ever think about selling it? The property around here has really gone up. I can't do that. This is where I'm supposed to be. Then I really admire you. I haven't done anything yet. So I came outta college with a business and a marketing degree. So then when I got offered this job at one of the top agencies in Denver, I didn't even think about it, I just, I just took it. And yeah, I, I like my job, but, I'm not changing the world. I bet you are for your coworkers and your clients. That's very kind. That's a good way to look at it. But, as of right now, I don't know what my coworkers think of me. My client is off shopping other agencies. So, you're hiding out here? I'm not hiding. Uh, I'm waiting. If it doesn't work out, there's probably a reason why. You're right. So I'm gonna start focusing on what I can do. Like building you a marketing plan. Remember, I don't have money to spend on anything fancy. No, no, no, I know. Not fancy. The idea is to get other people to talk about the ranch for us. Okay. I'll finish up here. - No. - You go on. Are you sure? I'll see you in the morning. Okay. Hey, Paisley. You haven't changed. Josh, it's Marcus. I got your message. Marcus, how are you? Look, man, I wish I had something more to tell you right now, but I'm still working on it. What exactly are you doing on a ranch in Montana? I'm just helping out with a few things. Cowboy boots at all, huh? I even got the hat. Look, brother, I gotta go, but I'll get in contact with you soon, all right? Hello? Hi, Paisley. Hey. I have an appointment with Mr. Marshall. Oh, sorry, I forgot to call you to reschedule. Mr. Marshall had to go to Chicago for a family emergency. Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that. Is there someone else I can talk to you about this? I think he just wanted me to sign some papers for the loan. He didn't leave anything, but we can reschedule for Friday. Okay. What time? 10 o'clock. Friday at 10 o'clock, I'll see you then. Sorry again. No problem. Sam? You always show up just when I need you. It's good to see you too. What are you doing here? Uh, figured I'd come rescue Josh. Rescue him from what, me? No, I heard he was having car trouble. You know mechanics, they'll take advantage of a guy like Josh. I don't think Charlie's going to take advantage of anyone. I don't know a sports car, gold credit card? They'll see him coming, trust me. Fine. Looks like I need to go visit Charlie anyway. Well, hop in, I'll give you a ride. Thanks. So what's the deal with you guys? There's no deal. I'm helping him while his car's getting fixed. And, he's helping me with my marketing, that's all. Paise. What? No, I'm serious. Does Josh know you're coming? He will. Sammy? What are you doing here? Oh. Sorry, I couldn't resist. It's okay. Josh is used to it. Hey, I know you're used to sitting behind a desk now, but, Paisley, come on? It wasn't Paisley. What was it? Butch. Hey, Sam's the one that tackled you. And whatever happened to never mentioning that again? Paisley, run. Oh, you're as big a pain as ever. Good to see you too. What happened to your truck? It decided to stop before we got home. Luckily, Sam came by to rescue me. I'm really surprised to see Sam here. Me too. I think he just wanted to see you. If you two aren't too busy in here, you wanna try to turning over the engine? Sure. You wanna ride with Sam? No, I'm good. All right. I'll follow you. All right, sounds good. Thanks, Jim. Hey. So the old boy missed me? I'm afraid so. I'm hoping it's just the battery. Yeah. Ah. You must be Charlie? Hi. Hi, I'm Josh. Nice to meet ya. So I have to say, when Paisley said Charlie was working on my car, you're not exactly what I pictured. Eh, I get that a lot. Short for Charlotte. Oh, bad news. Your alternator hasn't made it in yet. - Really? - Sorry. They just keep coming. Charlie, this is Sam, Josh's brother. He's here to make sure you're not ripping off Josh. Nice. Wait, so that's why you're here? I don't need your help. No offense, but, mechanics are notorious for taking advantage of someone who's not a local, and ignorant when it comes to cars. Okay, hang on. I wouldn't say that I'm ignorant when it comes to cars. I'm sorry. You look very nice. Don't let my looks deceive you. So, wanna come watch me change a battery? Sure. You wanna get some coffee? Yes. How long will it take? Won't take too long, but uh, take your time. ♪ Been doing things on my own ♪ Until you came along ♪ But this feels more like home ♪ ♪ I think we belong ♪ It's so different when ♪ I'm finally seeing life out on the range ♪ ♪ And I'm loving this feeling ♪ I think I could let my heart run ♪ ♪ I'm down for the ride, let's saddle up ♪ ♪ If you're by my side, I'll take the jump ♪ ♪ I could get used to this So where'd you learn how to do this? My dad, this is his place. I uh, run it for him. He's in semi-retirement. Him and my mom spend a lotta time traveling. I used to follow him around in here and watch everything he did. When I was five, I could change a set of spark plugs. Well, I don't know what I was doing when I was five, but I know it wasn't that useful. By the way, I'm sorry about what I said earlier about mechanics. Hey, it's true. You gotta keep an eye on us. So uh, how long are you gonna be in town taking care of Josh? I don't know. I heard he was waiting on a new alternator to come in. Ah, yeah, I could put a rush on it, but it's gonna be an extra charge. Nah, it's not necessary. I can stick around for a few days. I could show you around if you like. Yeah, I'd like that. Okay. Hey, are you the new owner? Yes, I'm Paisley. Welcome to Bright Star. I'm Laura. You must be Johann's granddaughter. I am. You knew my grandfather? Our family comes out here every year for the wagon ride. And we're so thrilled that you kept this going. Well, I'm glad to have you back. Johann's done so much for this community. He'll be missed around here. Thank you. Hi. Um, the photo you just took, would you mind tagging us? And then we can put you and your family on our website. I will, but let me get a shot of you guys. Uh, hang on one second. Sam, come join us. Say Bright Star. Bright Star. Hey Paisley. Hi. Thanks for the invitation, huh? Thanks for the new battery. Anytime. Paisley, come take a look. Not too bad. Not too bad? I look great. I'll send these to you guys. - Thank you. - Thanks. Okay, it looks like we're all here. So, if you'll go ahead and take a seat, we'll get going. I brought hot chocolate. Ooh. Hope you like it. King, Virgil. I just can't believe that I'm in the mountains driving a wagon. It's so fun compared to what I do in Denver. I take the train to work. Well, that sounds like fun too. No, no. No, it's not. Then why do you do it? Well, 'cause it's the most efficient way for me to get to where I'm going. And when you get to where you're going, do you like it? I guess so. I really like, I really like figuring out how to help the client and taking a concept from nothing into something that people can see and share, that's it. That's pretty cool. Well, it's not driving a wagon or anything like that. Maybe I'll let you drive next time. I wanna take you somewhere tomorrow. Where? You'll see. You'll see, but it's gonna be cold, so you're gonna have to dress warm. Where are we going? That was incredible. Yeah? Well, I'm glad you liked it. 'Cause if you're open to it, they wanna do some cross-promotions with the ranch. How would that work? Uh, well, a lotta tourists, they're looking for more than one unique experience when they're in town. So, they would promote us on their website, and we would promote them on ours. I would tell people to come out here anyway. It was so much fun. Well, that's why they invited us out here, to see all of this. Oh, but Paisley, I was thinking, we could invite them out to the ranch, for a wagon ride, something like that. That's a great idea. Let me get a photo, uh, for the website. No, you didn't. Sounds like you and Josh had a good time. It was a work thing. Yeah, you've said that, like nine times. Because it's true. Admit it, you have feelings for him. He's going back to Denver just as soon as he can, so there's no reason for anyone to feel anything, because it wouldn't make any difference. Are you sure? Don't say anything. What would I say? Hey, it's warmer in here. If you'll help Sam with the fire, I'll make some hot chocolate. Deal. Oh, thank you. Nice fire. Thanks. You ready to lose? Not today. You can go first, Paise. You're the only one who's called me Paise since high school. Yeah? What does everyone else call you? My grandpa called me Menska. Menska? It means "my treasure" in Norwegian. You want me to call you Menska? Paise is fine. So Charlie and I are going out later if you guys wanna come. You and Charlie are friends, right? And I wanna spend time with my brother. Yeah, that sounds fun. Okay. Hello. I didn't expect to see you two here. Oh, we're always here on Wednesdays. They have half-price burgers and dancing. And you must be Josh's brother? Yes, ma'am. Thank you for your service. You come by the cafe and you eat for free. I might take you up on that. You better. Charlie, you tell him all about our famous chicken fried steak. Oh my god, it really is. Come on, Dot, let's let these kids get back to their date. So, Charlie and I are going skiing on Friday. You guys wanna go? I can watch the ranch if you wanna go. That sounds like fun, but I can't. Josh, you wanna go? I would love to, but I have to get some work done. We tried. Come on, let's dance. Please tell me you remember this one? Uh-uh. No. Come dance with me. No. Yes. Yes, yes, yes, please. Come on. Fine. ♪ Up to the hotel room of my fiance ♪ ♪ But I never made it there 'cause she come ♪ ♪ Tearing through my life like a tornado ♪ ♪ Coming on hotter than a baked potato ♪ ♪ She spin me around then, see ya later ♪ ♪ Wanna hate her but I love her instead ♪ ♪ Let's go ♪ Well I lost my job and all of my money ♪ ♪ Most of my friends and half of my mind ♪ ♪ I'm so messed up it's a little funny ♪ ♪ Man, I though for sure that she was mine ♪ ♪ But now I'm alone That was fun. ♪ Pickin up the pieces of my busted life ♪ That brought back memories. Okay, so I don't know if there's a limit to apologies, but I'm really sorry about how I handled things when I was young and stupid. It's okay. We both were. Just, when I left for school, I thought that either you were gonna come visit or I was gonna come back after school. But you never came back. I know. And then after college I got the job. And then that was that. And then you were already dating someone else. You kept track of me? Uh. No, I wouldn't exactly call it that. But, Sam is really good at knowing your dating status. Yeah. He's pretty handy to have around, isn't he? Yeah. I may have asked about you once or twice. Really? You were engaged. Yeah. What happened? I don't know. Nick was great. It just wasn't right. Nick. I don't like him. You don't even know him. Come on, let's play pool. I know enough. So, why haven't you ever mentioned Josh before? Uh, because Josh hasn't been around for the last 10 years. Looks like you're picking up right where you left off. That song just brought back a lot of old memories. Must've been some good ones, huh? They were. Hey, so Sam is the sweetest guy I've ever dated. Do I owe you like, a finder's fee? Sam's definitely a good guy. But you two never dated? Actually, he's more like a brother. All right, who's next? You? Okay. So, what are we looking for? Um. Here, we're gonna start. Start where? Uh, down here. Sorry, I thought I saw Bree. You thought Bree was shopping for hardware in Montana? Uh, yeah. Well, no. No, I, I guess not. Maybe you should just call her, clear the air. You could obviously use the closure. Well, thank you for the relationship advice. I already tried. Hold these. Didn't help? No, she's not responding to my calls or my texts. Oh, well then I think you have your answer. You are free to move on. I never said I wanted to move on. Your face did. Anyway, I think this is all we need to fix the wagon for the hayrides. Yeah, the uh, clicky things. So what's next? Uh, we've got one more stop to make on the way back. That's it. Can you put this on a necklace? Sure. Did you wanna do silver or gold? Silver, please. Okay. All right, let me grab couple of chain styles to choose from. - Thank you. - Mm-hm. This would be perfect. I can have this done for you by Friday. Does that work? Yeah, thank you. Hey Sam, you ready to go? Yeah, I think I'm gonna get this for Charlie. You've known her for less than a week. Oh, so I should be more like you, like a girl for 10 years and then get her a gift? What Paisley and I have is complicated. I know. I'm sorry, what's complicated? You like her, right? I don't wanna see you get your heart trampled. I made it back from war. I'm pretty sure I can manage. I know, but I'm still your big brother. It's my job to protect you. Well, you don't have to be my big brother anymore. I'm all grown up. Yeah, but you still act like my annoying little brother. Tell you what, how 'bout I work on being a little less annoying, and you work on staying out of my love life. Wait. Now you love her? Ah, it's just an expression. Well, it's a good thing I'm here to take care of you. You'll end up married by the end of the week. Would that be such a bad thing? All right. So look at me. You have to have one hand right here, and then you have to brush like this, okay? You wanna try it? You can let go. He likes it! Good job. Okay, I think he likes this. I think he'd like this, okay? You wanna have one hand, and you just wanna brush. Josh, you ready to go? Yeah. Are you? Yeah, that's why I asked if you were ready. What, is something wrong? Um, I would just, you know. No, I don't know. Wear something other than jeans and a flannel. I'm going to get money for the ranch. This is how I dress. Okay, you're right. I wouldn't change a thing. Fine. She'll thank us later. Don't look at me. You're making me nervous. Sorry. Sorry. I don't know why I let you talk me into wearing this. I'm not comfortable, and when I'm not comfortable, I can't focus. Hey, you look great, you look great. Just trust me. You look like someone who means business. You look good. Have you got the shopping list? Yes, I have the shopping list. You got this. Yeah. Morning, ma'am, I'll be right with... Paisley? I didn't recognize you. Are you going to a funeral? Uh, no, I have my meeting. Remember? Oh, yeah. Ms. Sheridan. It's nice to see you, Mr. Marshall. Likewise. Would you please follow me. Would you please have a seat, Ms. Sheridan. Would you like some coffee? Um, no, thank you. I've recently acquired the assistance of a marketing professional from an agency in Denver. He's redesigned my logo and came up with new ideas to promote the ranch. Oh, let's have a look. Nice. Very nice. And you were able to hire an agency? On trade, room and board at the ranch. I admire your resourcefulness, Ms. Sheridan. Thank you, sir. Unfortunately, we won't be able to offer you a loan at this time. Um, why? The risk factor is too high. What does that mean? We look at the success of similar businesses, and factor in the amount of revenue that it would take for you to repay back the loan. I already have kids that wanna come, and people that wanna volunteer. I, I understand that you're disappointed, but it looks to me that you're gonna do just fine. The new logo and your marketing are really, really sharp. I know, I know I can make this work. I'm sorry. Well, what if you didn't give me the full amount? Instead of 350,000, what if I asked for 250,000? I'm afraid it doesn't work like that, Ms. Sheridan. But I do wish you the best of luck on your ranch. With your resourcefulness, I have no doubt that you will figure out a way to get your business off the ground. Thank you. What happened? Hey. I'm sorry. Did you lose something? Yeah, my mind. I can't believe I actually dressed up for that guy. I am never, ever wearing heels again. Just drive, please. He said it was too risky. Then we'll figure out another way. That's what he said. Sorry. That was my plan B. I know how you feel. Do you? Because it looks like you always get what you want. Like I get what I want? If Marcus doesn't clear my name, no other agency is gonna hire me. You had a setback. I'm sure your boss will figure out what happened. I was so sure I was getting the money to finish. If you're so convinced I'm gonna get my job back, why don't you let me loan you the money? Uh-uh, absolutely not. I'm not taking money from you. No, no, you're not taking my money. You're letting me invest. This is my dream, not yours. I know. I know. But that doesn't mean other people can't share your dream. Big organizations, they do it all the time. They find people who care about what they care about. I've been to dozens of fundraisers in Denver where the ticket prices were ridiculous, but the money goes to a good cause, so, nobody cares. I don't run in the same crowds as you do, Josh. When the receptionist saw me dressed like this, she thought I was going to a funeral. Okay, so then do something here that shows off Bright Star. You could host something in the barn. Lots of people come to Big Sky for the winter. Lots of people with money. So why don't you give them an opportunity to fund your summer camp? I don't know how to throw a fancy fundraiser. Think of it like a really big princess party. Yeah, I guess I can do that. We can even do a silent auction. We can get some of the local businesses to donate some items. That could work. Okay. This looks delicious. You do the frosting, and I'll place 'em in the oven. Where do you want them? Uh, right over here. This is my favorite part. I like this idea. I do too. It's a nice little touch to give a gift when you're asking for a donation. You're gonna need a taste tester though. If you want them to donate, then it has to be a good cupcake. How is it? I'm gonna need another bite. - Charlie. - Mm-hmm? Thank you so much for helping with this. You're welcome. That's what friends are for, right? Here are the donation forms. Josh and I will take this side of the street. Sam, why don't you and Charlie take the other. Okay. So do they get a cupcake even if they don't donate? Yeah. Give them a cupcake and a form. Maybe they'll tell someone else. All right, on it. See you guys later. Thank you. Okay, let's go. So I'm pretty sure this is our last batch. I think so too. I can't believe how everyone has pitched in to make this happen. Letting us borrow decorations and donating food. Oh, I even sent out some press releases, so we should be getting some buzz soon too. Thank you. Seriously. We already have 20 donations for the silent auction. There's trips, gift certificates, a spa day, balloon ride. And people are even donating scholarships for the camp. I mean, this is incredible. I think I'm gonna bid on all of 'em. Wouldn't that be a conflict of interest? Uh, you're probably right. Can I at least donate to the scholarship fund? You can, but you've already given so much, like the website. I love the new design. You did an amazing job. Really? Well, thank you. Hey, I was thinking about inviting my parents. What do you think? That's a great idea. Perfect, 'cause I told my mom we'd FaceTime her today. Like now? Right now. Hi, baby. Hey, Mom. How are you? I'm good. Where are you? Hi, Mrs. Lake. Paisley! Oh, it's so good to see you. You too. So Mom, Paisley and I were planning the Cowboy Ball, and wanted to know if you and Dad could come and help. Are you kidding? That sounds like a blast. Yes. Forward me the details. I'll pass it along to Tracen and Emily. Maybe they can come too. Oh, that would be fun, wouldn't it? It's a deal, we're coming. All right, see you soon. Thanks, Mom. All right. Bye. Bye. I love you. Bye. This is really happening, isn't it? I'm Kyle Gray from KBCK. Thanks for coming out guys. Yeah. Come on in. I appreciate you letting us swing by now. We just came from the resort, doing a piece on the ski patrol and their rescue dogs. Well, thank you. We really appreciate you guys taking the time to be here. Okay, so Gary's going to be filming while I ask you a few questions. Okay. Your names? Um, Paisley Sheridan. Josh Lake. Can you tell us about the ball and what that's all about? We'd love to. Yeah. Paisley is the new owner of Bright Star Ranch, and she's gonna be turning it into a retreat center and a camp for kids Tickets for the Bright Star Ball will be raising money to help her get it started. So, this is Paisley's project, so she can tell you all about it. Ms. Sheridan, have you always wanted to run a camp? As a little girl, my two favorite places were summer camp with friends, and the other was here on the ranch with my grandparents. We rode horses and went fishing and had campfires. I never imagined I'd have the opportunity to combine my two favorite places, but at Bright Star, through nature and equine therapy, I'd hope to be able to make a difference in children's lives. That was great. Now we have a lot of horse people here in Montana that are going to want to help you. How'd you come up with the idea for the Bright Star Ball? Oh, Josh is helping me with marketing. It was his idea. Tell us a little bit about the ball. What should we expect? There's gonna be a lot of great food, wonderful music, and dancing. And there's a silent auction with lots of great items donated by local businesses. It's gonna be a lotta fun. Excuse me. I'll be right back. That's perfect. Nice, yeah right there. Hey, can we get you in the photo, Mr. Lake? Sure. Yeah. Great. Oh yeah, that looks great. Perfect. You really think people are gonna pay that much for a ticket to a dance? Yes, they do it all the time. I've only sold two so far. One was to the man who turned down my loan. I think he felt bad. Next year we'll start promoting the ball much earlier. Oops. It's on. As a little girl, my two favorite places were summer camp with friends, and the other was here on the ranch with my grandparents. Tell us a little bit about the ball. What should we expect? There's gonna be a lot of great food, wonderful music, and dancing. And there's a silent auction. It's gonna be a lotta fun. That was a great interview. Thanks. You guys look good on TVs. Stop it. Hey, Paisley. You gotta see this. Is it good or bad? Just come here. I just wanna have enough people to break even. Dot and Annabel are already ordering food. Well, I hope they ordered enough. We're sold out? You're out of ice cream. I'm gonna see if Charlie wants to go grab some. Um, that's a good idea. I'll go with you. Let me grab my purse. I didn't ask her to come with me. This way, I can tell Dot and Annabel they need to up their order. That's a great idea. Don't say anything. I needed some air. Why can't you just be honest? At least with me. Because, this isn't going anywhere, we both know it. So I'd rather not be miserable when he leaves. Okay? There you go. Thank you. We saw you on TV. We sold all the tickets. Can you believe it? - Wow. - Paisley, that's wonderful. Oh, I forgot my notebook in the truck. I'll be right back. Mm-hmm. So Paisley's in love with Josh. Ah, I knew it. But he doesn't love her? Oh, of course he loves her. Why wouldn't he love her? No, he does. But he won't tell her, and she won't tell him, and I've been sworn to secrecy, so, it's down to you two. How much barbecue did we order? Oh, don't worry about the food, we've got more than enough. We were expecting you all to sell out. You were? Mm-hmm. Sam, could you help me out back? I've got some heavy boxes I need help moving. I'm on it. I just hope I don't forget anything. What are you gonna wear? Um, I thought I'd wear jeans since I'm gonna help you guys serve food. Oh, fiddlesticks. You can't do that, you're the host. Okay then, I'll wear a nice sweater and curl my hair if that makes you feel better. I just don't have time to go shopping. I was afraid you might say that. I have an old dress that I know will fit you. No, no, that's not necessary. I can find something in my closet I can wear. Wait here. Wait here. You ready? I'm waiting for Annabel. She's getting me a dress to wear to the ball. I know what dress she's talking about. Annabel, it's beautiful. I wore this for my engagement party 50 years ago, this month. Well, I can't possibly, it's too valuable. Yes, you can. And here's something for you to wear in your hair. Paise, you've got two fairy godmothers. I know. Okay. Thank you. Sure you don't want me to just do it? No, I got it. So, sounds like you're planning on sticking around a little bit after what you said last night about helping plan the ball again next year. Yeah. I can always come back next year and help. I don't have to live here. You could, but I'm not sure that's how Paise heard it. Of course, I'd love to say with Paisley, it's been amazing, but it's not that easy. Why you always gotta make things so hard? Because it's everything that I've ever worked for. Not to mention, it's a lotta money. I'd be letting down my entire company. Then it sounds like you already made up your mind. Coming down. Hi. Come on in. Hi. I can't believe you did this. Well, you gotta eat. You got too much on your plate, so to speak, to be worried about feeding Josh's parents. Thank you. If they're not here soon, just pop it in the oven. It'll stay warm. We're gonna go ahead and get things set up in the barn, so if you need anything, just holler. I will. Thank you, ladies. I'll see you later. Okay. Bye-bye. - Baby! - Mom. Hi. Oh, oh sweetie. Dad, good to see you. Ah, sweetheart. Oh, it's been too long. Your place is gorgeous. Thank you. Good for you, putting these two to work. I'm been trying to do that for a long time. Oh Emily, this is Paisley Sheridan, she runs the place. Paisley, this is Emily. She puts up with Tracen. Hi, I'm so glad you could make it. We are too. So nice to meet you. I'm Tracen. Yes. Nice to see you again. Annabel and Dot delivered breakfast, so I hope you guys haven't eaten yet. Oh, no. Marianne was so anxious she wouldn't let us stop. I know you have so much to do, and we wanna help. Thank you. And yes, I have a long list. Just tell us what to do. Well, why don't we eat, and then we can show them around? Let me get it. It's probably just someone looking for directions. Please give me your coats. Make yourselves at home. There's bacon and eggs, and on my gosh. Dot and Annabel make the best. Bright Star this is Josh. Josh, it's Marcus. Marcus? How are you? I'm good. I'm good. What's going on? Look, man, I've got some news for you. We found out who it was that leaked your reports to the Rogers Agency. Who was it? It was Bree. Bree? Well I can't believe she'd do that. Obviously she's no longer with us. But I've got some good news. Mr. Cooper has decided to move forward, and insists on working with you. Uh, yeah, yeah, that is great news. He's coming in to sign the contract first thing tomorrow morning. So, we'll see you here tomorrow at eight. I understand, and I'd, I'd love to be there, but I'm helping a friend with a fundraiser, and the event is literally tonight. My entire family drove down from Sun Valley. I'll tell you what. I'm gonna make a donation to your friend's fundraiser, a large one. Don't even care what it's for, as long as you're seated at the conference table tomorrow morning at eight. I'll be there. Are you coming? That, that was my boss on the phone. I have to be back in the morning. But you can stay for the ball? I'd love to, but you'll be fine. My family's, my family's here to help. Yeah. My boss said he's gonna make a large donation to Bright Star. That's great. We both got what we wanted then. Yeah, I guess we did. Well, it sounds like the deliveries are here, so. Paisley. Yeah? Good luck with everything. You too. Give this to Paisley for me? Eh, you should give it to her. We already said our goodbyes. Take care. You too. You know, after your grandmother passed, Johann and I became quite close. I'm glad he had you. He asked me to marry him. He never said anything. Because I told him no. Why? I was afraid. I'd already lost one husband, and, I didn't wanna feel that pain again. Annabel, I'm sorry. I missed out on a lotta happiness trying to protect my heart. And then when he died, it hurt so bad anyway. And I realized that we had wasted all of those years that we could've had together. Did Sam tell you to tell me that story? No. No one knows, not even Dot. I'm telling you this because I think you and Josh still have the possibility of a happy ending. No we can't. He's going back to his life and he'll forget all about Bright Star and me. Don't forget, menska, you are a treasure. And I can tell by the way Josh looks at you, he knows that too. "If you have something good in your life, don't let it go." I wanted to take a minute and say thank you for spending this evening at Bright Star Ranch. To all my dear friends that have shown up and worked so hard donating your time, and the local businesses that have donated decorations, food, and items for the silent auction, I could not have done this without you. It's been my dream to help children through equine therapy here at the ranch, but it was a friend who encouraged me to let others share in on my dream. So I just wanted to say thank you for sharing this dream with me. And don't forget to bid on your favorite items. ♪ All the love we didn't use ♪ All the time we used to lose ♪ All the lies that we said to us ♪ ♪ All the pain we said that didn't hurt ♪ ♪ All the fear you left behind ♪ All the brave I said I was May I have this dance? ♪ Is there such thing as destiny? ♪ You look incredible. Thanks. I thought you were supposed to be somewhere else. I can't think of anywhere else I'd rather be than right here with you. What about Denver? I'm not going back. Why? Because you're not there. Josh, you can't give up everything you've worked for. That's your dream. I had a lotta time to think about what I really want, and how to make it happen. So when I finally got cell service, I called the client directly, and I invited him out here to Big Sky to go skiing as my guest at the resort. And, he agreed? Yeah, he actually really loved the idea. He prefers the mountains over the office setting. He wants to come out here to sign the contract. That's great. But you'll eventually have to go back. I called Marcus and I told him that I would sign the contract, but only if he'd let me work from here. If that's okay with you. ♪ It took awhile too ♪ But I realize it's always been you ♪ ♪ It's always been you I can still hire a real ranch hand though, right? Definitely. Guys, you just hit your goal. You're serious? - Yes! - Yeah. Paisley. What's the occasion? No occasion. I just wanted to. Where'd you find this? I had it made, just for you. Because you shine just as bright as the Montana stars at night. Let me put it on. I love it. Thank you. Since you're sticking around, I've got something for you too. Oh yeah? What is it? Dude, she's giving you the horse. You're giving me Butch? If you're staying in Montana, you've gotta have a horse. You wanna take him for a spin? You think you can keep up? Oh. You ready?
