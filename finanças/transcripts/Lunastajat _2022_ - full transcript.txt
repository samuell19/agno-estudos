In the Last Chance to the Eternal Sanctuary, you shall be Redeemed. In the Last Chance to the Eternal Sanctuary, you shall be Redeemed. In the Last Chance to the Eternal Sanctuary, you shall be Redeemed. In the Last Chance to the Eternal Sanctuary, you shall be Redeemed. you shall be Redeemed. In the Last Chance to the Eternal Sanctuary, you shall be Redeemed. I'm sorry! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Overseer Z-32. Are you ready to guide the marked Novice 425? Yes, Grand Master. His failure would be your failure. He must succeed in his trial in order to one day be part of the Colony again. Yes, Grand Master. Take the Novice and go. Zezweka shall reveal the path to Redemption. THE REDEEMERS It was horrible. All five Grand Masters were there. I've never been so scared. What did they say? -That worshipping magic - is against our teachings. -It's true. It was only in the story I wrote. I don't worship magic. I only wrote about characters who did wrong. By writing this fantasy trash - you support heresy and progress of the apocalypse. But it wasn't fair. They took the text and burnt it, - But it wasn't fair. They took the text and burnt it, - but they also marked me. Kristoffer, nobody, not even my own family talks to me. I can't handle it... -Joakim. You can only take contact with your own Overseer. You can talk to you family once... -Once the marking is removed. Kristoffer. If you could talk to them and say that I deserve to be Novice again... You can have the title back but it takes Redemption work. My reputation is at stake here. Do you understand? I do. You take the next house. I'll monitor. You won't leave before they are all Redeemed. Show me what you've got. I'll go get the spare key. Is it still in the garage? We have to answer. -Play me some time. Hi. Who are you? I'm Joakim. Where are Sebastian and Linda? They're at Sebastian's mom's. She had a medical thing. They're at Sebastian's mom's. She had a medical thing. They're not here. They're not here. Did Sebastian and Linda invite you to play? To play? Yeah. Can't wait to play. Okay. Can I come in? -Of course. Like we would play outside. Come in. Hi. I'm Kristoffer. -Vesa. Okay then. What are your characters? Characters? -Yes. I'm Overseer Z-32 and Joakim is Novice 425. I'm Overseer Z-32 and Joakim is Novice 425. That might work. We have a faction with mechanically improved cyborgs - and completely artificial people. Are you androids? No. -Okay then. We're Redeemers of the Last Chance. Alright, that's cool. Did you come up with those characters yourself? No. -I see. What are your levels? One thousand two hundred... -Sorry? -...sixty... -What? Eight. Wasn't it eight? That makes sense. -I'm level nine. I could have some coffee. I could have some coffee. Didn't you make it yet? -You can do that. Amateurs. You hear that? Some good ol' black liquid Black gold I mine some gold I wash some black gold I mine some gold I wash some black gold What's going on with you two? Well that's none of my business. You should have seen your faces! Actually, you know, we can't see our own faces. Try it! How long does one game last? I always say that a good game... Today, for example, eight hours. Eight hours. Eight hours at least. I've built it to last the whole evening. It's done. I could go to the toilet. Yeah, it's right here. Okay, thanks. -No problem. Yup yup. Watch your toes. Hello! -This is Milla. Here's Vesa. Hi, nice to meet you. I'm Vesa and I'm your Dungeon Master tonight. I know what a DM is. Of course! I didn't know you've played before. A spectacular outfit. -Thanks. I made it myself. Really? Amazing! It has a Mad Max vibe to it. Come on in. Apparently, Sebastian's mom is sick. Apparently, Sebastian's mom is sick. Joakim and Kristoffer are friends of theirs. They will be playing with us today. Hi. -Hi, I'm Heidi. Howdy, I'm Tomi. -I'm Milla. Grab some coffee so we can get the game underway. I can't wait. Linda not being here, we can't play the main quest. But don't you worry. Now that you have all arrived in the town of Galbagua, I have a side quest called "The Mystery of the Tavern." First, we should introduce our characters as we have three new players with us today. Milla, Joakim, - as we have three new players with us today. Milla, Joakim, - and Toffe. I mean Kristoffer. I will play supporting characters, most noticeably... Cawo Dargin, the innkeeper, - who has heard screaming from one of the rooms. Tomi, you go first. Airship pilot Mist Flayne in the fucking flesh. A feared and respected veteran, - whose Zeppelin rules all of Awan's airspace. Good. Now Heidi. My character is sheriff Dez Aeryn. Nothing slips by me. My proficiency is firearms. Tight. Now Milla. -Yes. Hello. Nice to be a part of the group. Nice to be a part of the group. I am bounty hunter Neewy Antha. I heard your gigs pay well, so I didn't want to miss the opportunity. That went well. -Oh, thanks. And what about you tall boys? I'm Novice 425 and he's Overseer Z-32 and we're - from the Colony of the Redeemers of the Last Chance. The apocalypse is here. We collect people's names to The Holy Paper so - they can be rescued to the sanctuary of The Eternal Redeemer Zezweka. That's fucking awesome! Sounds just like those cult maniacs. Love it! What do you mean? -Why did you choose these characters? What do you mean? -Why did you choose these characters? What's the point of playing nut jobs - who worship an imaginary being? We don't worship any imaginary beings. -OK. A solid argument. Do they want to belong somewhere while being lost in their lives? We know who we are so feel free to join. Imagine me coming here one day wearing a fucking toga - with a shaved head, speaking in tongues. Yeah, we were inspired by those maniacs. We don't have to be these exact characters... We are Redeemers. Did you get offended? -No. My dude's deep in character. How do you know Linda and Sebastian? Golf... We've played golf together. Okay. Where are your costumes? We left them upstairs. Joakim, would you mind getting them? Yes, I'll go get our costumes from upstairs. Be quick. More coffee? -I'll come with you. I'll go get it for us. -Okay. Kristoffer, will you come too? -Sure. We'll go change in the sauna, we'll be right back. Be quick so we have time to play. -Sure. That prick with a walking stick is annoying. -Don't worry about him. He'll die alone and be damned. I would just like to... -Kristoffer, listen. We need to stay calm, play their little game - We need to stay calm, play their little game - and when they leave, we take care of him. We've made it this far. -Let's make sure no one enters this room. You think I could be part of The Colony again - when this is all over? What? We'll Redeem you and your friends by force - if you make one more sound. Blink twice if you understand that. Kristoffer, I think that's enough. What's taking so long? Are you coming? We'll be right there. -We should start playing. We'll be right there. -We should start playing. Hey. When we finally get to order, Seb was like: "20 hot shots". The bartender makes them for 10 minutes - and then asks, frustrated: "Anything else?" Seb says: "Give me another 20 hot shots." Wait up, I'm not done yet! The bartender makes another 20 fucking shots. Seb now has two whole trays of them. The bartender asks, with the most pissed face ever: "Anything else?" Seb thinks for a moment and says: "A long drink with ice." Seb thinks for a moment and says: "A long drink with ice." A long drink with ice! You know how he is! -Yeah. Seb... The next morning, he wakes up on that very sofa with puke all over him. He goes and wakes up Linda like: "Somebody's puked on our sofa!" Linda wakes up and says: "Honey, it's only us two that live here." "So take three guesses." There's a lot of these stories! Awful! Three... He doesn't need... So, you've met at a golf course? -Yeah, how come? Just wondering... I haven't seen you two there. We must be going at different slots. I see. Come on Nancy Drew, relax! You know, Heidi is a police officer. Wow! -She's always in character. Loosen up once in a while! Loosen up! -Fucking hilarious! A police officer. No one can react that fast... Sit down. -How many times I dare to cut him... Sit down, everybody! There has been a murder. No one leaves the premises before we know who did it. Welcome to "The Mystery of the Tavern." I've told every one of you if your role - is that of the murderer or of an innocent bystander. Now sheriff Dez Aeryn will interrogate everyone. After each interrogation the number on the dice will tell - After each interrogation the number on the dice will tell - if the sheriff believes you or not. You all have a motive, and I won't believe anyone - without hard facts about what happened last night. I'm the innkeeper Cawo Dargin. Interrogate me too. Let's begin. First off... First off, bounty hunter Neewy Antha. Sit down. The victim is the mayor of Galgabua, Trax Chindaburg. There was an illegal bounty on his head. Why wouldn't you be the killer? Neewy sighs and stares at the sheriff. Neewy sighs and stares at the sheriff. I only do legitimate hits. I'm an honorable bounty hunter. You will never make this much money with legal hits. I believe in law and order. I do like money but it has to be clean. I see. Besides, if I kill someone, - the body won't be left lying around like that. I wouldn't get caught and the body would never be found. Fine then. I'll do my charisma roll now and I have +3. Whether or not Neewy was telling the truth, - you believe her. Vesa, you're next. -Right. Cawo Dargin walks routinely to the table. This is not the first time he's being interrogated. Innkeeper Cawo Dargin. You were heard arguing with Mr. Chindaburg - the night before the murder. He refused to pay for the drinks of his party. In my place, even the king has to pay. Did he pay? -Unfortunately, he didn't. He "opened a tab". I doubt I'll ever see my money. So you thought the bounty will cover all of your losses. I'm not a killer! I've never even hit anybody! That's hard to believe. You're the innkeeper in Galgabua - and you've never been in a fight? People like me and my tavern. We have a gentleman's agreement. People like me and my tavern. We have a gentleman's agreement. My guess is that - you've built a repression towards your customers - and yesterday was the last straw. Cawo is visibly shocked. What the fuck have you done? Me? Whether the story is true or not, - you don't believe him. Something doesn't add up. Mist. A remarkably attractive human male strikes his staff to the ground. Mist Flayne approaches Des Aeryn, puffing with self-confidence. Sit down. This wouldn't be the first time you've killed someone - just because he annoys you. That doesn't make me a murderer. Also, we came to Galgabua - work I heard you in the hallway around the same time - the murder occurred. Why would you think it was me? -I heard your walking stick. Is it forbidden to pee at night? I didn't hear you flush. That's right. Disgusting! Get out of my sight. You believe Mist Flayne's story. Actually, I came to this town also for another reason. Actually, I came to this town also for another reason. I came to propose to a certain blonde. Solid, right? Oh yes, very good. Lastly, the two cultists. Come here. Should there be a romance between our characters? Romantico. Tico tico. I think my character prefers other types of men. You believe the apocalypse is here? -That's right. You also believe that by redeeming people - you help them to get to a better place. To the Sanctuary of Zezweka, The Eternal Redeemer. Right. So you have a hierarchy in this religion of yours? Some sort of levels to climb up? All Redeemers start as a Novice, - then they can become Overseers and... Grand Master is the highest rank. But there's only five of them. How long have you known each other? Since we were kids. You joined the Colony of Redeemers of the Last Chance as kids? No. You are born into it. Let me rephrase my question. You have been members of this sect - your entire lives? -That's right. your entire lives? -That's right. Why are you an Overseer and Joakim only a Novice? At which point did you pass him? Overseer Z-32 has always been hard-working... I did more Redemption work. Tell me, Overseer Z-32, how do you redeem people? We collect names to The Holy Paper. Then they're part of us. What if someone refuses to join? I believe Mr. Chindaburg was planning to join you, - but changed his mind. Tell me, Overseer. Can you redeem someone by killing him? If you kill someone, will he get to the sanctuary? If his name is on The Paper, it doesn't matter how he dies. Where are Linda and Sebastian really? I think our characters don't know any Linda or Sebastian. But this Chindaburg... We didn't kill Mr. Chindaburg. You don't say! You don't believe a word they're saying. Hello? You're outside? Yes. Someone will come. Your sushi order. -Okay, thanks. The sushis are here! Hello, we're the Redeemers of the Last Chance. We are bringing important news. Don't you want to Redeem your prize? Did we win something? -Yes, you did. Congratulations, you won a prize. Congratulations, you won a prize. We would only need to get your contact info. Well, let's do it quickly, we're in a bit of a hurry here. "Linda and Sebastian Koistinen." I'll pre-order the sushi now. I'll go get the car from the shop. Do you need a ride? -I'll grab an Uber. Sign here. What did we win? You won a spot in Zezweka's Sanctuary. Is it a spa? We can go relax in a spa! Wonderful! -Actually... The apocalypse is here. We collect people's names on The Holy Paper - so that after their death their souls have a safe haven - in Zezweka's Sanctuary. -I'd like to hear more about this... Zezweka. -Yes. He's a person, right? Yes, he is. -Now I'm interested too. So Mr. Zezweka has... The Eternal Redeemer Zezweka, in His wisdom, has made a - sacred promise to accept all the Redeemed after their deaths to - His Sanctuary, while all the rest will fall to eternal damnation. You're safe now because we have your names. Wonderful. How long has this Zezweka existed then? Since the beginning of the world, so 6203 years. And you've been members all those years, I reckon. Are you mocking us? -Absolutely not. I am... We are all in! Now we would only like to know - when we can participate in ceremonies and rituals. when we can participate in ceremonies and rituals. Your closest Colony will contact you, and the initiation will follow. The initiation is a wonderful experience! -I'm sure it is! It's mind-blowing when they tell everything about Zezweka... Do we get gowns or these... These are first self-funded... -Fuck me, I just can't... Why don't you rip the paper up and get the hell out of our house. Sorry, I don't follow... -Give me that. I can't stand you people. You're like a cancer, spreading everywhere! You should all be hanged. Also, you're worthless, - there are only our names on this! Try to understand that we're saving you. -All right. Hand over The Holy Paper. -Kristoffer, where did you get that? Hand it over! -Okay... Redemption is the only way. You should be thanking us. -You're out of your mind, kid. In the Last Chance to the Eternal Sanctuary, - you shall be Redeemed. Shut up! This one is for you. Huh? You want to be marked for the rest of your life? Like this? Look at me. Everything is ok. You have been Redeemed so your soul will get to the Sanctuary. Everyone has a good time there. We'll see you there. Are you expecting someone? Are you expecting someone? -Some friends are coming over. You take the body. Please don't kill me, please... If you make one sound, I'll send you straight to the Sanctuary. What are you doing? What are you doing? Kristoffer... Fucking hell! -Run upstairs, quickly! Let's go. I'll go get the spare key! Is it still in the garage? We have to answer. -Play me some time. Is the sauna warm? -Sauna! Sweet! Oh yes. Around this time we usually go to the sauna. Yeah, uh... I'll go switch it on. Joakim, will you take care of the trash? Joakim? -Yes! The what? -The trash. Sure. Everything alright? You seem a bit tense. Sorry, no... I mean yes. -Come for a smoke. To keep me company. I don't think I will. -Come. Please. No thanks. It's against out teachings. Oh, you're still in character. You're funny. I think your character is great. I also like the way you play. -Thanks. Do you follow my channel? I don't know what that... -Okay. Well, I create gaming content. Let me show you. Let me see... This one's pretty funny. I'm joining this steampunk role-playing game. Sometimes I shout things like that... I'm going to create the most epic outfit of the millennium. I'm going to create the most epic outfit of the millennium. Alan Friedeberg writes here that there could be some desert elements in it... Thanks, Tomi. I like these necklaces too. Tomi, is it him? -Same guy. How well do you know him? Not at all. He just asked me to come. I don't know him. This is so cute! Look! Don't bite. This is Nappi. Nappi? -Yep, that's his name. I love dogs. -You do? Have you ever had a dog? We're not allowed to keep dogs, or any animals. Yeah, "not allowed." That's what I do. Anyway... That's what I do. Anyway... I liked it. -Really? Thanks. Follow me if you like that sort of stuff. It's just that... You seem like a - mysterious man. Tell me how's Joakim - outside of this character. What do you do in your free time? You can tell me! You've seen what I do so you can open up about anything. Well... I like to write. Like what? -Sort of fantasy stories. That's cool! You should write us a role-playing adventure. That's cool! You should write us a role-playing adventure. Actually, I don't write anymore. I used to do that. Why not? I've been told to concentrate on my work, so... That's bullshit. Seriously... You need to do your own thing. You need to be in a job that makes you happy. You mean being a writer for living? Yes, exactly. When I started to create content for streaming, I didn't have followers. But when I started to create content that I liked myself, - people started paying attention to it. Come on, I mean it! You should start writing. You could write us an adventure. I would be tha first in line to play it. Would you? -Definitely. One day we could design some characters together. You and me? -Why not. You and me. I would like it very much. All right! Great! Let's do that. Come. I'll go check on Kristoffer. -Alright. See you in a minute. Sorry it took me so long... What the fuck took you so long? Sorry! They were outside, they could've seen you! Well they aren't there anymore, are they? Give me a hand. Fetch the girl. I wonder what's taking so long. What? Where? -There! Quiet! Please be quiet! Everything's all right. What now? -The plan is still the same. We go back inside, finish the game, go to the sauna, - grab a couple of beers, and after people have left, - we come back and finish this. Damn it! We're going to need a bone saw. A bone saw? Hey! What are you doing? -Get off of me! We're not murderers! In the Last Chance to the Eternal Sanctuary, - you shall be Redeemed. What have you done! What have you done! He was alive! Kristoffer, he was alive! He wasn't dead! We still could have gotten out of this! He's with Zezweka now. Fuck! Kristoffer... I don't want this anymore. I want out. -What did you say? What did you say? -Please think about this... Please! No! Please! No! You're not going anywhere... -Don't... Here's what we'll do. We go back inside - and we Redeem everyone, with force if needed. Kristoffer... -What shall it be? Are you in or shall we pull your pants down? I'm in! I'm in, I promise. Kristoffer, please! Then everyone was like "what the fuck, Tomi?" And I was like "I know". You're still part of the Sacred Text. You can now decide - if you want to be one of us and start to do Holy work, or... if you want to be one of us and start to do Holy work, or... I'll join you. I'll join you. Long live Zezweka. Joakim, did you hear that! We now have three Redeemers here! I'll personally make sure - you both get good points tonight and advance in levels. Everybody wins! Get it? Joakim, I'm confident your marking will be removed after today. Linda, you've returned from Sebastian's mom's - and Sebastian stayed there to take care of her. Moms have to be taken care of. When the game ends, we ask for everyone's name to The Holy Paper. We'll start with that Heidi. This works, right? This will work. This will work. Joakim, give me Linda's phone. You two are clearly in shock. You poor things. If you try anything, - I'll blow your brains out and rip your throat open. I'm sure you understand. This is going to be great. I'm sorry. -What do we do now? You have to trust me, OK? Your life and my life, - and the lives of your friends are in danger. I need to convince your friend, the police officer... Heidi. She needs to understand that Kristoffer is a murderer. But it has to be subtle. Otherwise he'll kill us. I'll think of something. Try to get my phone back. I'll go to the toilet and call the police. Try to get the phone back. -Okay. We won't die today. -We won't die today. I'll go see what's taking so long. Sorry it took so long. The sauna is different than usual. I see. You didn't notice the button on the wall? It's usually inside the sauna. Right. I carried the steam water in, though. -Come so we can continue the game. Hey... Sweetheart... Are you all right? Yeah, I... Did Sebastian stay with his mom? Yes... He did. Your friends Kristoffer and Joakim have played with us today. That's nice. You don't have to play yet. You can watch us finish this quest. Soon we'll go to the sauna and relax. You want something? Water, beer? -I'm good. What happened to your lip? -I bit it. Aww... -Linda! Aww... -Linda! This means we can continue the main quest later today. First we'll finish this. Vesa, I think Linda has had quite a rough day. Should we maybe stop the games for now? Wouldn't you actually like to play? Wouldn't it make you happy? It would. Kristoffer... How has everything been going here today? Good... Really great. We've played some games here. When shall we go golfing again? Golfing... Don't know yet. I should probably - ask Sebastian what he thinks. Sebastian is a good guy. Let's wait for his mom to get better. Sebastian is a good guy. Let's wait for his mom to get better. Whoops. My bad. How come you have so many followers? -What do you mean? I guess the same way than all the other streamer whor... Fuck these "me too" times... Streamer female persons. Just say it out loud. -I will say it out loud. Half-naked, pushing your ass. That's what you do. What's your problem? Go "baa" somewhere else, God's Lamb. I've built my fanbase by creating quality gaming content. I'm sure you have. -And so what if I was half-naked? Men have always made money with female nudity! If we do it ourselves, then it's suddenly a huge problem. It's not a problem for me... -Now, now... Pretty please let's not fight. It's not a problem for me... -Now, now... Pretty please let's not fight. Because fighting's not a pretty sight. Are you ready? Soon we'll find out who's the killer. Or will we? Oh boy! Linda, you don't have a character is this side quest, - so could you take notes about who suspects whom? I would like to, but I don't have my phone. You left it here when rushing out? -Yes. I think so. Kristoffer, you found a phone, right? Maybe it's hers. -I have it right here. Excellent. The final statements. Everyone will tell who they think is the killer, and why. Everyone will tell who they think is the killer, and why. Neewy Antha. You begin. Neewy clicks her fingers and looks at the sheriff with confidence. The killer is the innkeeper Cawo Dargin. He knows how important the reputation of his tavern is. He was embarrassed last night. I believe that can lead to desperate actions. How can you even say a thing like that? Okay. Mist Flayne's turn. Mist Flayne knocks his staff to the ground once more. Let's see... The murderer is obviously - that bounty hunter chick. She will do anything for money. And this gig paid well. -Fair enough. Next up, Cawo. And this gig paid well. -Fair enough. Next up, Cawo. The evidence speaks for itself. Mist Flayne was heard walking in the hallway - exactly at the same time Mr. Chindaburg was killed. Just look at him. He's dressed in fine clothes. Walking stick. An all-around gentleman. He would not use the toilet without flushing. Thank you, Cawo. Now... Last but not least... The Redeemers. Who do you suspect? We think that... -Actually, if I may... Mrs. Sheriff. -It's Miss. Miss Sheriff, I need to confess something. Overseer Z-32 and I are from the same Colony, - but we've wanted different things from this trip. but we've wanted different things from this trip. I came to this town to do honest Redemption work. I wanted to collect as many names as possible to The Holy Paper - to save souls. But the methods of my colleague are more ruthless. Now you see Novice 425 trying to build up his courage... Last night I was in a deep sleep, - but I heard the door opening and Overseer Z-32 entering, - smelling like cigars. He had clearly spent time with Mr. Chindaburg. He had surely tried to Redeem Mr. Chindaburg. But Redemption work is not easy and it doesn't always succeed. Mr. Chindaburg said no - and the Overseer couldn't take it. In conclusion, Miss Sheriff, - I believe that my childhood friend, mentor and repository, - Overseer Z-32 - Overseer Z-32 - is the murderer. I believe you. Throw a five or bigger. No fucking way! -Wow! Congratulations. Kristoffer really is the murderer. Yes, he is! -You got me! Everyone gets 1.500 quest experience points, - but for the right answer both Heidi and Joakim - will get 400 extra points. Thank you. Should we... -Joakim. You'll also... You'll also... You'll get an inspiration - which means that the next time we play, you get an additional roll of - a dice at any chosen moment. Jesus Christ... That's awesome! I'm still... so moved. Hur Gah! Hur hah! Ha! That's funny! An amazing side quest. Too bad, Linda, that you only saw the finale. Soon you can join us. Now that we know he's the murderer - should we maybe tie him up? What's the status on the sauna? -It's not ready yet. Should we have a beer break? -Yes fucking way! I'll join you. -Let's go. But... But... Vesa... Kristoffer... You think I'm an idiot? -What? Try again. Okay, I'm sorry... -I'm very disappointed in you. You play your character very well. The role of a cop. I mean sheriff. -Thanks. You're a real badass! Thank you so much for inviting me. I haven't played live games that much. I would gladly come again. This could become our thing. LINDA: THE GARAGE!! Are you coming? -You go on ahead. Okay! Kristoffer... You've been so invested in your fantasy trash - that you haven't realized how our Colony has been evolving. The Grand Masters realized that we simply don't have time - to Redeem people in traditional ways. Since then, all methods have been accepted. Kristoffer, could we just leave? Let's go home. Let's go home. What should I do with you? Oh Seb... Seb. 4.1 sound. Yeah. Have you ever watched my streams? Unfortunately, I haven't. -Oh, okay. It was Tomi who discovered you. -I watched her play CS... Mostly I'm interested in the fact that as a woman playing FPS games, - what's your headshot percentage? Do you hit the head or mostly toes? -Come on. We go downstairs and Mass Redeem them all. No, we don't, Kristoffer. Your Redemptions - have been Redeemed. Come on. Now you will show me how to do this right. As you surely have guessed already, - we actually are from the Colony of the Redeemers of the Last Chance. So fucking meta. Now each and every one of you will write your name down, - so you may all be Redeemed to Zezweka. What does it mean? The apocalypse is coming and this is the only way to salvation. I don't think I will sign any papers now. No fucking way. -Pass. I don't think I will, either... Is that even real? -Shall we try? I believe you. Jesus Christ... Now you will all write your names down. You left a few too many clues. One, for instance, was that - golf club. Everybody knows in which direction Seb keeps it pointing at on his altar But don't you worry. I fixed it to point at the right direction. Another important fact was - that you left Sebastian's body in the garage. First you must have kept it in the sauna. Then you moved it through the window to the garage. Then you moved it through the window to the garage. You forced Linda to play along. I guess Seb resisted. Maybe he fucked around with you, - so you shot him. You've made a big mistake. Kristoffer... We've made a big mistake and we just have to live with it. Today, I've also realized something else. There are so many things to see and experience in the world. Everyone should do what they really want... In the Last Chance to the Eternal Sanctuary... Are we going to call the police? Right? You're fucking insane! Fuck yeah! Thanks for a great session, guys! Thanks for a great session, guys! Vesa, you were fucking fantastic! Tell me about it, boy! -You're a fucking legend. Thank you. You crossed the plains of Zachnir - and defeated Butcher Friedeberg in an epic battle. Heidi, you take care of the authorities. -As usual. Tomi, take the body to Masa for disposal. Take my car. Fucking aye. Remember to take a long rest to restore our HP back to maximum. I must say he fought well. Reminds me of the Battle of the Gerff Jungle - for the ownership of the lagoons. That was an insane ride. How many experience points do we get? -Let's see. Everyone gets 1300 experience points from the quest - and 800 experience points from the Butcher battle. Seems that Lady Yuzu got a level up! -That's right! You're now on level 13 and at last you got the immunity to quicksand. I'm so proud of you, love. -Thanks, honey. The leader of Hur Gah Clan, Vinzente, - found a golden pocket watch on the body - on which you did the "Detect Elements" spell - and found three Discharges of Plasma. I needed those. Fuck yes! Next you head to Galgabua, - where the infamous bounty hunter Neewy Antha, - whom the whole city fears, waits for you. Trax Chindaburg, the Mayor of the city, has invited you - for a special assignment and promised - a price on Neewy's head. -Tomi, you had an idea? I sure did. I checked out this role-playing channel and found this streamer. Well, we chatted and she absolutely wants to join in! Well, we chatted and she absolutely wants to join in! You want to see her? Her name is Milla. Very pretty! -Spectacular! You don't say? Ditch the body and we'll see again next Saturday! Hur Gah! Now we can continue with the main plot. "The Battle of Galgabua." "He, who rules Galgabua, - rules all of the oil trade routes of the county of Awan." An old Awanian saying. What the fuck? -Bounty hunter Neewy Antha - has allied with Overseer Z-32 - but they have been caught and are both unarmed. The battle will be difficult for them - as Hur Gah Clan is fully armed. What have I done to be here? Let me go! For years, you've killed innocent people for a price. Now karma strikes back. You're fucking insane! Why are you doing this? What do you mean? This game? You know what my occupation is? I'm a government customer servant. A government customer servant! I listen to so much bullshit each day, but here... Here I can shine. The whole week on duty at the police headquarters, I dream of Saturdays - when I'm reunited with my family. We're heroes. We can do anything we want. In this world we take shit from no one. You chose the wrong house. Do you ever have the feeling of not being in control, Toffe? I hated that feeling too. So much that one day I decided to set myself free. And do whatever makes me happy. Can I join you? Unfortunately, you're the opponent in this adventure, - so it's impossible. But thank you for your interest in the Hur Gah Clan. Let us go. We won't tell anyone about this. When the battle begins, you will have a chance to escape. When the battle begins, you will have a chance to escape. In your turn, you can go 20 steps in any direction - and also do one attack. You don't have any weapons, though, but it is what it is. First, we throw the dice and whoever gets the biggest number - goes first, and so on. There, there. Everything's all right. I'll throw on your behalf. What a twist! Neewy goes first, then Overseer Z-32. You make your move in that order. Can we escape now? -Please do. Yes! Milla, you go first. Please go. One! Two! Three! Four! Five. Six. Seven. Fuck! 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16... Hey! It's not your turn yet! This turn-based battle dynamics went to shit again! This turn-based battle dynamics went to shit again! Go after them. We'll do it in real time. Chop chop! Go out the window! Is it going to take long? Do you need new dice? How in the actual fuck? Level up, bitch! Celeriac. I remember when - as children we visited uncle Erik in the countryside. He and his wife grew celeriac by the field during fall. Uncle Erik and his wife - set the dinner table always next to the Japanese garden roses. And we dined while the sun set. And it was always celeriac soup for dinner. It's kind of funny how - as a child you don't know how to...
