This is it. Once again, we as a people are late. - Right. - That's right. Late, late and more late! Now, how is it that Columbia, dartmouth, Yale, all of these supposed greater institutions of higher learning, can beat us, mission college, to the punch? Again I ask, how is this? Can anybody here answer this little question for me? - What question? - What question? This question. How is it that all of the schools that I have mentioned, and a lot more, I might add... How is it that they have divested all of their money in South Africa... Yeah, yeah, yeah. And we backwoods negroes here at the so-called finest black college in the land, - mission college... - That's right. We are holding on to ours? Holding on fo it like a wino clutching his last bottle. Yes! Till we have completely divesteq, we need to march, we need to protest, we need to disrupt classes, we need to sit in, we need to shut the school down if need be. Gammites! G-phi-g, that's what we wanna be! G-phi-g, that's what we wanna be! Now, this homecoming weekend is the perfect opportunity for us to marshal this attack. Gammites, halt! Real. Real. - Real. - Real. Gammites! Gammites! Gammites! It takes a real man to be a gamma man! ‘Cause only a gamma man is a real man. You know what, Julian? I thought that was really nice. I really did. Now why don't you take your gamma dogs and get the fuck out of here? - Yeah. - Yeah. We of gamma phi gamma do not agree with this African mumbo-jumbo. And I am here to let you know that your revolutionary activities here at mission college are detrimental not only to the student body and the administration, but to our brothers and sisters in South Africa, as well. Meow! What, you all need some cat food or something? - You need to wake up, Julian. - That's right, god damn it. Man. Yo, man, what's up? Fellas, wait! As president of the student government association and a key-wearing member of phi beta kappa, I abhor and will not tolerate violence or the threat of violence on this sacred campus. - Fuck you, scrotum face! - Yo, man. Go read a book. It is safe to say that president mcpherson agrees with me 100%. So, let's break this up. Virgil, why don't you shut the fuck up? You heard what I said. Please, will you leave? Dap, he did say "please." Shut up, Monroe. Okay. He's full of shit, man. Come on. Let's go. - Hey, homeboy. - Squash all of that. Squash all of that. - Piece of shit. - Got somewhere to be? Gammites! G-phi-g, that's what we wanna be g-phi-g, that's what we wanna be g-phi-g, that's what we wanna be g-phi-g, that's what we wanna be g-phi-g, that's what we wanna be g-phi-g, that's what we wanna be g-phi-g, that's what we wanna be g-phi-g, that's what we wanna be g-phi-g, that's what we wanna be g-phi-g, that's what we wanna be - Rachel... - Dap. Don't pay him no mind. He's just trying to make you angry. - Julian is bugged. - No, Julian is smart, Rachel. He's confused, but he's smart. Come on. Walk me to my class. I can't. I gotta stay here. I gotta stay in shantytown. See you later? Yeah. Okay. Don't worry about it. Be crisp, be clean! Roll call! Gammites! Greetings! Dean big brother almighty, most eloquent leader of gamma phi gamma. Woof! Gammites! Hello, big brother general George patton, sir! - Gammites! - Hello, big brother Chucky. No rush! - Gammites! - Hello, big brother Dr. feelgood. - Gammites! - Hello, big brother Lance. - Gammites! - What up, big brother X-ray vision? I don't like none of these motherfuckers. Man, you know, I hear they've been trying to get some trim. Oh, shit! Julian, how long these sorry moonheads been on line, anyhow? Word. Gammites, do you hear this? Six weeks on line, and you still do not meet the approval of your big brothers. This deeply grieves my heart. Now, when you began, there were 10 gammites. Now only eight remain. Now, I do not know how many of you will cross the burning sands to the oasis of gamma phi gamma. But I do know that there is no room for any pretenders. A weak link amongst the ranks. Which one of you is it? - Slim daddy! - No, not my personal slim. - Rhino teeth. - Don't be putting it on slim. Mussolini. - Porky. - He couldn't be that big. Sir nosy. - Sir nose. - That's a nose. - Yoda, definitely. - Yoda wins. No, it couldn't be Yoda. It was nose. It was nose. Yoda, there's no truth but truth. Oh, no! Oh, no! - Mustafa. - Double rubber! - Don't lose me my bet. - Don't get close. Doo-doo breath! - Doo-doo. - Unsavory goods. - Half-pint! - Yes, Dean big brother almighty. - How tall are you? - Five feet, five inches. Yeah, you're a 5'6" piece of shit. Yes, Dean big brother almighty. I don't even know why you pledged. This is not for you. Gamma men are real men. - I am a real man, a gamma man. - Were you asked to speak? You're not a gamma man yet. Brothers, I suspect this sawed-off human being hasn't even had a girl yet. - It's not true. - Isn't that right? I bet you're still a virgin, aren't you? No, Dean big brother almighty. - Are you calling me a liar? - No, Dean big brother almighty. I haven't been a virgin since ninth grade. Bullshit! You're a goddamn virgin! You ain't seen no parts of the pussy. I'm not no virgin. You'll become a gamma man over my dead body. I don't even know how you got this far. You're weak, a pussy. And you're gonna drop just like your cousin. I'll be a good gamma man. You'll see, you'll see. Look, don't be eyeballing me. Lay off him, Julian. You'll become a gamma man over my dead body. Now, look. You better get a freak over here tonight. And no gamma rays, neither. I don't care if she's blind, fat, no teeth, one leg and a kickstand. I ain't pledging no virgins. You got it? So you get that freak over here tonight. Now straighten up and get the hell out of here, all of you! Get that smile off your face. Darrell. Sorry, but I can't let the big brothers see me talking to you. Thanks a lot. So, what's up? Dean big brother almighty went off on me. I told you not to pledge. So, what else is new? I gotta bring a girlie back to the gamma house tonight. He thinks I'm a virgin. Ah, for once in his life he's right. - Come on, dap. - So, what you want me to do? The gamma grapevine says we'll be going over tomorrow night. - And any fault they find will "x" me. - Mmm-hmm. I'm your first cousin, family blood. You've got to help me. Hey, Darrell, when you needed money, I gave it to you. When you needed your laundry done, I did it for you. I got you food and stuff for your big brothers. I just don't happen to have no females laying around the dorm. And even if I did, I wouldn't help you like that, man. This one day, can you forget about your differences with Dean big brother almighty? - You mean Julian? - No, Dean big brother almighty. - "Julian.” - no, I mean "Dean big brother almighty." All right, already, Darrell. Damn. Vaughn. Think about me. This'll be my neck. Can't you talk to Rachel? She has a lot of girlfriends. Rachel? No, no, no, no. No haps, man. What, have you been smoking crack? - Don't you know any women? - The ones I know I asked already. What about the ones you don't know? Did you ask them? What am I gonna say? Say, uh... I don't know. Tell them what they want to hear. You know, lie your butt off, man. Okay, okay. Better yet, just be yourself, Darrell, okay? Okay. Come on, man. Come on. Get up. Come on. Get up, get up. You will be a gamma man tomorrow. - Think so? - You damn skippy. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You go first. We wouldn't want Dean big brother almighty to see us together, would we? Very funny. - Thanks, cuz. I won't forget this. - All right, man. - Gammal! - Yeah, yeah. This man had a vision. And that vision was passed down to his son, Haywood. Mission college was founded to educate the sons and daughters of slaves... You don't have to recite our history to me. Now, we have been and will continue to be grateful for the support of the snodgrass family. - The food is getting cold. - All right. Hold it. I've got something else to say. This is a new day. There is a feeling that the predominantly black college, for all intents and purposes, has outlived its usefulness. Over the years, it has been vital to our elevation in this great country, but the need no longer exists in an integrated society. That's absurd. It does exist. It exists at notre dame and yeshiva, Brandeis, at brigham young. Now you tell me, what is the difference? You want to know the difference? I'll tell you the difference. The difference is that the catholics alone support the notre dames. The Jews alone support the yeshivas. Mormons support the brigham youngs. Who supports the black colleges? I'll tell you who. The federal government and philanthropists like snodgrass. Harold, why won't blacks support spelman, tuskegee, morehouse, Howard? - We do. - Barely! Look, as chairman of the board, I was sent here to talk with you. Now, he does not like this divestment mess, and I don't like it, either. Now, you better snip it right here at the bud, or I will. ‘Cause if you don't, you stand a good chance of losing them. There itis. Yeah. People like them don't like to be told what to do with their money. Old, old money. Shit, I tell you all time after time, do not sit here again. Stay off my bed. Stay in your own room. Ignorant motherfuckers, I swear, man. Sorry about the bed, homeboy. But check this out, we got a question for you, man. What's up with your cousin half-pint? - Yo, man, why is he pledging? - Oops. Yo, man, you wanna take your last breath? I didn't think so. That's my cousin. You leave him alone. You don't talk about him like that. - We understand each other? - I'm sorry, man. But seriously, man, what's up with the pint, man? But seriously, who's going back to the administration building with me tonight? Not the kid. Uh-uh. Man, you crazy. We're going to the coronation. - More butts and more titties. - That's right, god damn it. Hey, wait a minute. I thought y'all was down for the cause. Yeah, you my brother, but goddamn, man. That's right, goddamn. You should lighten up on that shit, Malcolm, seriously. - He's right, nat Turner. - Marcus garvey. Frederick douglass. Yeah. You all can kiss my black ass twice, hear? Preach, Jesse. Preach on. Yo, farrakhan, relax. Don't be so sensitive, my man. Chill. What about the parade? Somebody coming to the parade with me, maybe? Hey, I'm down, man, but not tonight. I gots to see some butts shaking, you know. Word up. I'm with him. That ain't no joke, man. I can't. What about the rest of y'all? Tomorrow. All right, bet. Enjoy yourselves. I'll see you all tomorrow morning, 9:00 A.M. sharp. That's kool and the gang, brother. Later. Jordan, this look familiar? Looks like your mother. - Yo, yo, my ball, man. You don't need it. Gamma. Anybody call me? Perry? - How you doing? - How are you? - You recognize me? - Yeah, I've seen you on line. Aren't you number one? Yeah, that's me. Half-pint, gammite number one. Gamma phi gamma. - Pleased to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - So it's almost that time, huh? - Yeah, it'll be any day now. Are you excited? A little. So, half-pint, what can I do for you? I was wondering maybe if we could see each other, go out to a movie, a restaurant, pop some jiffy pop popcorn together? - You know, enjoy each other's company. - Yeah, sure. That'd be nice. That sounds real good. Why don't you come by after you go over? I'm usually in at night. - I was thinking soon. - How soon? - L can't. - We could have fun. Big fun. Just give me one reason why not, just one. First of all, I don't know you from Adam. You just pop out of thin air, and I'm supposed to say yes? I've always been attracted to you. I just couldn't tell you before. I was shy. But now that I've been pledging, I'm a different person. Well, I'm not attracted to you. Besides, I don't want a physical relationship. All you guys are dogs. I've heard about you gammas. I'm not trying to dog you. Look at my face. Can't a real gamma man be attracted to you? Hah? Is this some type of a joke? Did your big brother send you over here? I don't have time for children's games. And you're so small, I'd probably break you in two. See? See? See? I knew it. I knew it. That's okay. Gamma rays, I call to order the 35th meeting of the sister order of gamma phi gamma fraternity, incorporated. Meow! Meow! Kim, could you read the minutes from the last meeting, please? All right. We decided that velda will take care of the music for the fashion show. Velda, please, none of that hip-hop b-boys nonsense. - Yeah. - I happen to like run-dmc. Nevertheless, leave it at home. Miriam, did you call the boutiques? Yes, I did. - Did you make a list of the suppliers? - Yes, I did. She is such a pain in the ass. Look. Let's not make this long, okay? We have to get dressed. - Now what have we decided? - Okay. I talked to the brothers and the gammites are definitely going over tomorrow night. All right. - S0 we should give them a party. - Yes. They haven't had fun for so long, a jam will be on. - Where, at the frat house? - Yeah, at the gamma house. The brothers said it was cool, but we have to clean up first. "Clean up"? Are you crazy? Look, we have been cleaning up after those sorry, tired, trifling, shiftless negroes from day one. And I am not cleaning up. I refuse to clean, I... Miriam, why are you always complaining? This is for g-phi-g. - For the black and silver. - Yet and still, I am no maid. - And we are? - Well, I have a question. - Who's gonna pay for it this time? - We're giving it, we should pay for it. - Yeah, we always pay for it. - Common sense. No! - We are gonna pay for it. Now, Dina, how much did we make from the bake sale? - Enough. - Party. I'm not going to the party. Where's the freaks? Here's to the Liberty bowl, man. - Couldn't get one. - Oh, shit! You've been jamming us up since we started, man. I don't go over. I'm coming after you. Four women. - What's wrong with five? - Come on, man. Yo, yo, yo. Hold up. Listen, half-pint. You got to go back out and bring in a freak. - Two freaks. Yeah. Here's five dollars. All this is, is a test. And you're going to pass with flying colors. I want you to take that five dollars us currency and go to the pet shop, get yourself a kitten. Put it in a cage and mark it "pussy." Give it to Dean big brother almighty and say, "pass the pussy." - Pass the pussy - meow pass the pussy that's what you got to do you got to pass the pussy it won't work. Pass the pussy, pass the pussy the word 1s "excuse me." Nobody told you to stand in the hall, either. Excuse me. That's better, miss thing. It's not real. - Say what? - You heard. It ain't even real. You wish you had hair like this. Girl, you know you weren't even born with blue eyes. - That's right. Blue contact lenses. - You're just jealous. - Right. "Jealous"? Rachel, I've been watching you look at Julian. You're not slick. If that was true, he wasn't much to look at. Tell her, Rachel. - Pickaninny. - Barbie doll. - High-yellow heifer. - Tar baby. - Wannabe white. - Jigaboo. - Don't start. - We're gonna finish it. Re-re, open up!

That'll work. The chair, having recognized Dr. feelgood, without objection the motion is carried. - Grill these bastards. - Grill. Death will be too good for these offenders of the law. - Brothers? - Yes, sir. Let's make the streets safe to walk again. - Hear, hear. - For the women and chilluns. See, we're gonna have to make a decision between the gas chamber, the electric chair, or death by goddamn lethal injection. You're guilty of eight counts of treason. Like a big bitch. Guilty of eight counts of conspiracy. I know you conspired. Having been found guilty as charged, I hereby sentence you to meet... - Oh, no, big brother almighty, no! - No, no. No, no... Big Bertha! Be still! Lights out! - What the fuck is this? - Drop your sweats! - Move. Let's go. - Look at them drawers. Bend over and assume the position. In other words, knock it out of here, yeah! Play ball!

I'm not going. Well, I suppose dap isn't going, either. Now, you know that has nothing to do with it. Spare me, Rachel. Rachel, you haven't seen anybody else since freshman year. Don't you ever feel like seeing other guys, like having other relationships? - No. - Yes, you do, Rachel. No, I don't. Come on. Listen, dap's a good guy. - I like him. - Mmm-hmm. One of the more positive brothers on this campus, right, Lizzie? That's right. But I bet you he's snaking. Ooh! He can't help it. He's a man. It's their nature. Mmm-mmm. - Are you coming or not, Rachel? - No, I'm not going. - Oh, come on, Doris. You are tired. She's tired, man. She put the "t" in "tired." And that's all somebody would have to do, is get a bus and put a sign on it that says, "all the fried chicken you want." And you know black folks would be on that bus in a hurry. Or, "all the drugs you want." Or, "all the alcohol you want." Or, "all the..." Would y'all excuse me for a minute, please? I'll be right back. Hey, how you doing? - How long you gonna be out here? - As long as it takes, Rachel. - How long is that? - Probably all night. All night? On this planet, only a few are chosen. You do or you don't.

Why I get the sloppiest roommate in school, I'll never know. Did you have to use the whole can? Uh... Well, you know Grady. I mean, he don't feel at home unless it smells like a locker room in here, you know. Yeah. What's the matter? We had static with Jane and the gamma rays. Earlier today you told me not to let Julian bother me. So what's up with you and Jane, huh? What happened, Rachel? The usual. Well, fuck them. I don't give two motherfucks about them. So I don't see... - Here we go. - Here we go, where? Don't start, all right? What are you talking about, "don't start"? I know I have my problems with them, but with you it's a crusade. I'm beginning to think you're color struck. You definitely have a thing against light-skinned blacks. - Who, me? - Yes, you. No, no, Rachel. It's them. It's not me. Come on, I adore octoroon, quadroon mulattoes. They're so un-pure. And you're 100% pure? Massa was in your ancestors’ slave quarters just like everybody else. No, no, no. No white blood in me. My stock 100% pure zulu Maasai. Nubian knight of bingyjoint. You are so silly. But on the serious tip, some of the wannabes are all right. The rest suck. If people are cool with me, Rachel, I'm cool with them. You're full of shit. And you need to check yourself on that tip. Butterflies begin from having been another as a child is born from being in a mother's womb but how many times have you wished you were some other someone than who you are? Yet who's to say that if all were uncovered you would like what you'd see? You can only be you as I can only be me flowers cannot bloom until it is their season as we would not be here unless it was our destiny but how many times have you wished to be in spaces time, places than where you were? Yet who's to say with unfamiliar faces you could any more be loving you that you see? You can only be you as I can only be me ooh, ooh, ooh I can only be me hold up. My arm's gone to sleep. It's getting late. Don't you have to go back? I want you to spend the night, okay? - What about Grady? - Forget Grady. I have something to tell you. No, I'm not pregnant. Oh, okay. What? - I'm pledging delta next semester. You're what? I'm going to pledge delta next semester. I've been to a couple of rushes, and if they accept me, I'm gonna do it. First it was Julian, then it was Darrell, now you. Everybody tripping or what? What is this? - I don't believe this, Rachel. - Believe it. You sure know how to spoil a pleasant evening. I know how to spoil a pleasant evening? I didn't come in here talking about pledging no sorority. I must have been sick in the head to think I'd have your support. Yeah, you must have been sick in the head ‘cause you ain't getting my support on nothing like that. No way. - Thought I would. - Yeah, well... You know them sororities are just as bad as fraternities, Rachel. Vaughn, this is something that I want to do. - But this is another matter. - Now that's bullshit. You haven't even considered the good things that they do on campus and in the... That's bullshit, Rachel! They change people. You won't be the same. People change for the worse after they pledge. If I seen it once, I seen it a million times. - There's no way you can tell me... - I'll be the same Rachel. - And I'll still love you. - Mmm-hmm. Yeah. - Mmm-hmm. - Oh, fine. Why don't you go join the gamma rays, while you're at it? Okay. Now I see. This has nothing to do with the gamma rays, right? You know, Vaughn... I've often wondered if the only reason you're with me is because I'm one of the darkest sisters on campus. Good for your all-the-way-down, pro-black nationalist image. Rachel. Rachel. Hey, how are you? What's that? G-phi-g the people united will never be defeated the people united will never be defeated gg-phi-g she's so fine damn, the queen of your mind damn, the queen she's so fine damn, the queen of your mind damn, the queen she's so fine damn, the queen our people united will never be defeated our people united will never be defeated g-phi-g, let's go! - Hold up. Hold up. - Let's straighten this out. Well, I see we meet again under unpleasant circumstances. Dap, you are in direct violation. You need a permit from my office to participate in this parade - and you don't have one. - Dig it. No permits, no parade. - Julian, I can handle this myself. - Well, handle it, then. Excuse me. - Give me the banner. - We ain't giving you shit. That's right, god damn it. We pay tuition here just like everybody else. Fucking wannabes make me sick. When will you jigaboos ever learn what it is to do it by the book? Who're you calling jigaboo? You call people in your family jigaboo? Look, I am sick of you niggers! Every day the same shit! Damn, virg. Such profanity. - 'Niggers"? - Calm down, killer. All right, chump. What do you gentlemen want to do, kill each other? - No, no.

Gonna win it, coach. Men. We have gathered here today to do a job. God told and explained to Jonah that the essence of love is to labor for something. - That's right. - To make something grow. That love and labor are inseparable. - Yes, sir. - That's right. One loves that for which one labors, and one labors for that which one loves. All right! When we get out on that gridiron, it's what we have labored for all week. All right! Now, I want every man to think about his responsibilities, his role. This is a team made up of 65 players, and it will take a total effort by a committed, dedicated, never-say-die, never-give-up group of 65 individuals who have come together as one! Yeah! We don't have to be told, sir! To do this job, to win this battle. - I don't have to tell you... - No, you don't. The stands are packed with your friends... Right. - Classmates, your families. - That's right. - Alumni has traveled from near and far. - Talk to me. I won't even mention that your lady friends - will be watching you. Yeah! Hear, hear. - Do you want to let them down? - Hell, no! Do you want to make a bad representation of mission college? Hell, no! Do you want to lose homecoming - for the fourth year in a row? - Hell, no! Do you want me to lose my job? Hell, no! - Do you like the devil? - Hell, no! Well, the devil is in that other locker room! Make us feel them. The devil is wearing black jerseys. - Can I get a witness? Yes! - I want intensity! - Oh, yeah! - L want reckless abandon! - Oh, yeah! I want you to remember that this is mission college! And then, by the name of all that is holy, go out there and kick some butt! Yeah! Let's go! Come on! That's the way! It's just the first quarter. Mission tigers, take it on out ho, ho, ho, ho, ho mission tigers, take it on out ho, ho, ho, ho, ho mission tigers, take it on out fire it up, mission, fire it up fire it up, mission, fire it up all right, defense! All right, steady! Tigers in the front! Yeah! Let me hear you grunt! Tigers in the middle, all right! Let me hear you sizzle hold them! Tigers in the rear let me hear you cheer, all right! - Hey! Where's the blocking? - Oh! - Tigers! - Tigers! Wag your tails! Go back and get the goal! Come on, man! Red, right, red, right! Oops, upside your head say oops, upside your head oops, upside your head say oops, upside your head oops, upside your head say oops, upside your head oops, upside your head say oops, upside your head - This doesn't look good. - Mission never says die. Yo, yo, what the fuck is going on? I've been here four years. We've lost every homecoming. - You play like a bunch of pussies. - Man, down in the front! Take your hat, your coat and leave, motherfucker whoever said that shit ain't got no mother, man. Mcpherson: Vaughn dunlap. Yeah, president mcpherson. How'd you get the name "dap"? Just a nickname. That's all. Anyway, Vaughn, you've been a good student these past four years - and you've grown into a fine young man. - Thank you, sir. That's why I'm so surprised at your recent activities. "Activities"? You've become a disruptive force on this campus. You're hindering other folks from an education. Let me make it plain. Hey, man, you don't really have a choice. If you continue these antics, you'll be expelled. Plain and simple, short and sweet. This is cedar cloud, chairman of the board of trustees. - What he says is true. "True"? With all due respect, president mcpherson, I don't believe this man knows the meaning of the word. So what? You marched with king in the '60s. Big deal. That was over 20 years ago. Black people still catching hell all over the world, you know. - Sit down, son. - We have made progress. Says who? There is no way you can defend not divesting completely. - No ifs, ands, or buts about it. - It's your program we don't like. You cannot hinder other students from getting an education. I'll do what I have to do. So will I. You know... look at me! You've got a lot of living to do. I had classmates here at mission just like you. And now they're old and bitter. - You still don't understand, do you? - Make us understand. - Is there anything else? - Mcpherson: You may go. Thank you. - We'll be watching you. - You do that. - Sorry about the game, man. - Hey, that's all right, man. We gave it the old mission college try, right? - No, we didn't. - So I lied. We got stomped, man. What was the score? What, 52 to 77? I don't know, man. I was looking at the honeys in the fourth quarter, man. - Hey, Rachel call, man? - Not since I've been here. - Bet you it's dap. - Let him call. Miss life, does that sound like the president of the dap dunlap fan club to you? It does not to me, Witherspoon. Well, the president handed in her resignation. I told him about me pledging and he went off on me. - Did I hear right, Rachel? Yeah. Did I just hear that you're going to pledge? Thanks for telling us. It's a big surprise. It shouldn't be a surprise. I've always wanted to pledge. - Since when? - Since I got here. Oh, since you got here. That's great. So now you feel you have to belong to something. You have to go up and join up with some people, huh? The gamma rays have certainly gotten to you. Come on, you all. I have a sense of who I am. - Then why Walt till your senior year? Yeah. I was afraid of what dap would think of me. What dap would think of you? Well, I'm glad you came around. ‘Cause these boys will run your life. Just give them one chance. - Dap, the word is out, brother. - Hmm? Mcpherson called you in on the carpet. Dag, man. Who told you, man? You can't hide nothing from your boys, man. Holding out on us again, huh? So what's up with that? Mcpherson is on me about the south African thing, man. - What'd I tell you? You see? I knew it. I knew it. Uh-huh. What else? I know there's more. What else? He threatened me with expulsion. They're talking about kicking me out of school. Man, that isn't no threat. That's a promise. - That ain't no joke. - I doubt it. Anyway, look. You all supposed to be my boys, right? Right. And we all agree that mission has to divest, right? - Right? - Yeah. All right, then, that's it. We got to do something, something big. I don't know what it is yet. But it's got to be something to let mcpherson, the administration, and the world know that we won't have no part to this apartheid thing. Hey, look, I need y'all, man. The rest of these okey-doke negroes is too worried about graduating and getting a Brooks brothers suit. But you all, I need your back. Hey, look, if you all ain't down, you all just another bunch of foot-shuffling, wannabe white uncle Toms, as far as I'm concerned. Dap, man. You know I love you like my brother, man, but I mean, what is wrong with wanting to have a nice job? - I don't think anything's wrong. - Yo, man, my daddy, my mama, they slaved all their damn life to send my black ass to school. - Do you think I got bank? - Hey, I'm not finished, man. I'll be the first one in my family to go to college. I mean, dap, man, do you realize what that means? I mean, the first one ever. And all my family has always been sharecroppers since slavery. - Man, apartheid is slavery. - You can do what you want to do, dap. I ain't throwing it away for nobody. Not you, not bishop tutu, not even Jesus Christ himself. Come on. Let's go. Come on, you all. Don't leave me hanging. Dap, you need to lighten up, man. Seriously. Stay out of trouble. Hey, mcpherson is bluffing, you all. Dap, in life there are times to be quiet, man, to shut the fuck up. This is one of them. - That's the way it's going to be, huh? - That's the way it is right now, bro. Bet. That's a bet. Later for you cheese-eating niggers. Fuck you all. Hey, yo, why we got to be all that, dap? You need to Max out, man. What do you two-faced, backstabbing bastards want? We want to know, do revolutionaries eat Kentucky fried chicken? Uh, excuse me, book. Let me ask you just one question, my brother. - Book. What? When you going to get this goddamn raggedy car fixed, man? Now, what's wrong with it, man? I mean, it runs like a stocking, man. And furthermore, you know, you wouldn't believe how many women I done boned in that there back seat. Man, you got to get a new word, man. You're running "boning" dead. - Man, like what? - Like, uh, "blend." - Try "blend." - No more boning. Try "blend." Bet. Bet. Hey. You wouldn't believe how many women I done blended in that there back seat right there. Aw, you're right. We wouldn't believe it. Never let it be... I said, never let it be said that booker t. Washington did not satisfy a woman. - Man, I lays much pipe. - Yeah, you're just like the roto-rooter. Liquid-plumr. Check it out. If you have so many women, how come it is that we ain't seen you with one, not one, - this whole semester? - Not naming names. I got to graduate. All you guys think about? Is that it? - You damn skippy. - Monroe, my man, my man, talk to me. - What do you want us to think about? World affairs. - The trickle-down theory. - Who's gonna win the super bowl? I just get tired of you all always talking about women. - Women. - Well, you ought to try it sometime. - Yo, man, it beats singing. - That's right, god damn it. - That's another thing. - What's another thing? - Shut up, man. - Why don't you learn how to articulate, - you juvenile delinquents? - Shut up, man. - You turnstile-hopping... - Shut up! Welcome to Kentucky fried chicken. May I help you, please? You know what I think we should eat somewhere else. Yeah, let me have a two-piece meal with fries. Yeah, two-piece, all-white with fries. Right, so make that three two-piece with fries and a colonel's meal. - White meat or dark? - You want white meat? - I want white meat. - Yeah, he wants white meat. - We don't have any white meat today. - Then why did you ask? S0, Monroe, I'll give you that $30 back next week, man. Yeah, right. Book, you got any salt down there? All right. Excuse me, brothers. Think I can borrow the salt from you all? We ain't finished. So I said to the bitch, "look, you don't come to me with no shit like that." So when do you think you'll be finished? What time it is? - Later for them, man. - I ain't thinking about them suckers. Yoo-hoo. Look, don't start no shit, all right? - Just let them go. - Yoo-hoo. Over here. What? What do you want, man? - Do you boys go to mission? Yeah. Is it true what they say about mission men? Hey, Grady, man, no. Let's go. Hey, yo, fuck them. We've already paid money for this... Yeah, yeah. I know it. Let's go. Come on. No, man. I ain't finished eating my chicken yet, man. Hey, yo, why we gotta... For them suckers, man? Yo, dap, hold up! Yo, dap, man! - Yo, dap, chill for a minute. - Squash it, edge. Hey, yo, dap, come on, man. Don't do that. - Squash it. - Yo, missionaries. - The jheri curl is popping shit. "Missionettes." Ready-for-the-world is popping shit. Come on. Man, what's up with that? - Yeah, brother. What do you want? - You ain't no kin to me. That's right, and we ain't your brothers. How come you college motherfuckers think you all run everything? - Is there a problem here? - Big problems. I heard that. You come to our town year after year and take over. We was born here, gonna be here and gonna die here and can't find jobs 'cause of you. Yeah. Right. Now can we go? Okay, can we just go? I mean, we may not have your education, but we ain't dirt, neither. Man, ain't nobody said all of that, all right? You mission punks are always talking down to us. Look, brother, I'm real sorry that you feel that way, okay? I'm really sorry about that. - Are you black? - Take a look in the mirror, man. Look, you got a legitimate beef, all right, but it ain't with us, okay? Are you black? Look, man, don't ever question the fact whether I'm black. In fact, I was going to ask your country-bama ass why you got them drip-drip chemicals in your hair? That's right, god damn it. And then come out in public with a shower cap on your head. - Like a fucking bitch. - Who you calling a bitch, bitch? Well, if the shoe fit. You know, I bet you niggers do think you all are white. College don't mean shit. You all are niggers, and you going to be niggers forever. Just like us. Niggers. You're not niggers. - Come on, man. - Fuck you up. Get the fuck out of here before I bust a cap in your young college ass. Go on. Wait a minute. You know what? I don't really want to believe them, I mean, but do we really act like that? My name's Bennett. I ain't even in it. No, no, but you know, what the guys were saying about us. That my name's Paul, and that's just between you all. - Yo, man, we're not wannabes. - They were ignorant. I don't know, guys. I don't think so. Look, man, motherfuckers got to start and try and better theirself, man, - just like we're trying to do. - Dig it. Maybe they've tried it, and they've just given up. Yeah, that's the deal, man. You think everything's so damn easy, don't you, Grady? Hell, yeah. You work or you starve. I want to eat sirloin. - Then the guy was right, man. - I know the guy was right. I told you. - What do he know? - He knows a lot. So, like, do you think that maybe you could drive any faster? I'm going to be late for glee club. "I'm going to be late for glee club." - See, you guys are like picking on me. - No! No, man, you our boy, man. - Hey, baby. - Hey, baby. - Hey, baby. - Hey, baby. She's got a beard, motherfucker. She looks just like your mama and shit, man. At least my mama ain't got no beard on the back of her neck. Your mama got two titties on the back of her neck and shit. - Yo, Jordan, Jordan. “what? I heard your mom held Kareem to 15 points. The newspaper said your mama playing fullback for the hefty hos and shit. That's all right, man. At least she's starting, man.
