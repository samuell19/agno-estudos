Dumbo calling Circus. Some tickets have been sold, and some are still available. If your family wants to see it, there should still be tickets. But the reviews are divided about this movie. You either like it very much, or you hate it very much. Thank you. Do come early and enjoy yourself. There'll be lucky draws and pretty girls. Minimum spending is HK$900. Oh, my wife is Japanese. So lovely. You're so lucky. I'm more handsome, taller and nicer than you... but you're the one with a Japanese chick. Real Japanese girls aren't as good as those in adult movies. Mine is only obedient, subservient... and let me do whatever I want. Her facial expressions and the noises she makes during sex... get old real fast. This world is so boring. Let's get ourselves laid. Circus calling Dumbo. Report your status. Get a fool to answer me! Fool replying. Nothing to report. Oh no! Excuse me, sir. Is this your cigarette butt? Yes, I accidentally... I'm sorry! Really? It was just an accident? I thought you did it on purpose. Don't say anything. Oh, she's lost! I'll take her to the bus stop. Wait a second. Kid, I don't know what you want. But I know I'm really hot. Try to keep your emotions in check for half an hour. Once I get off work, I'll take you to... How did I do just now? - You were okay. - Was I abrupt? No, not really. You'll never believe this. Eleven o'clock. Dragon Cafe. Mong Kok. See you there. I'll see what you have to say. Do you mind if I do something? Hurry up! I'm on duty. Bye! The kidnappers have collected the ransom! Seal off the area! Go to work! Police business! Move it... Police business! Move it... - Police! Turn on the lights! - Police! - Down! Don't move! Sit down! - Be quiet! Police! I'm sorry. We have to seal off the cinema. Please cooperate. Don't leave. Police business! Males here! Females over there! There are so many people. We better separate them into smaller groups. Males here! Females there! Short-sighted here! Far-sighted over there! Year of the Rat there! Year of the Goat here! Year of the Goat plus Pisces over there! Squat down if you're born under any of the animal signs! Hold it! Males left! Females right! Those who are underage stand at the back! Good idea! What's your name? Yu First. I'm Ho Yoiji! What's yours? Yu First! I told you already! It's your turn now! My name is Yu First! You think that's funny? Show me your ID card! What do you do for a living, Mr Yu? Singer. Currently recording. I'll release my EP soon. Hip hop or R&B? Hip hop, of course! Madam, ID card please! Sir, when can I leave? I've got to cook for my husband and son. Then you shouldn't have come to the movies! Who is it? Who is hiding in there? Police! Come out... - Hands in the air! Come out! - Come out... It's the hostage! Drop your gun! Don't move... Drop your gun! Go... You assaulted the police! Don't shoot... It's just a toy gun! I'm just holding it for my son! Don't shoot! Don't run! Lend me your shoulders. Why run so fast? Bullets can't reach this far. Thank you! Was my punch painful? No, it's okay. You're so lovely! I better go now. Don't go yet. You have left something behind. What have I left behind? Your ID card! Thank you! Forget it. It doesn't matter. Just mail it back to me when you find it. Wait... Don't waste HK$400 for a replacement. Maybe it's hiding somewhere. Let me help you look for it! No, it's not in there! Maybe it is! Let me look! No! - Really, it's not... - Enough! It's your luck that I'm willing to touch your stuff! It's ruining my luck you know? - Come on! - No, it's really not in there! Idiot! Don't move! It hurts! You're really something! I tried my best, but you still saw through me. That's right! I'm the most wanted criminal in the last five years. People call me Transformer the Kidnapper. My name is MacGayfa! Don't come near me! Shoot if you dare! Help...! I'm so sorry! It's my fault! I really can't bring myself to arrest you! Just leave! Thanks for being such a supporter. Okay, see you later! You scumbag! Take this! - Help! - I have a hostage! This is the remote control! This is the bomb! - Help! - If I press it, it'll explode! Bro! You said I'm your supporter. That means our friendship is forever. Your hostage is only a lost school girl. If you go to prison for it, you'll be laughed at, you'll be ignored. People will eat your chicken wings, and they won't play with you! No, Uncle! Don't hurt the innocent! I'm pressing the button! So, have you found it yet? We're still looking for it. Be quick. Find it before the others do. Got it. Ho Yoiji! The people's champion. Keep up the good work. Thank you, sir! I'll leave you alone. Good bye, sir! Why are you sweating so much? Mayumi! You want me to get the bathtub ready for you? I don't want a bath today! I've told you many times, you're my girl, not my servant! All you had to do was ask. You didn't have to steal it! I'm sorry. You just put it by your bed. I thought it was a gift from you. That's a big misunderstanding! Then whose bracelet is this? We'll be married soon. We have to be honest with each other. Do I really have to tell you? Do I really have to? This belonged to a girl from last night. She hit on me and waited for me to get off work. I was pretty sure that she admired me. Although she's not as hot as you... she was gentle on the outside and very open inside. She was really worth a shot! Unfortunately, she died last night. Isn't this a pity, Mayumi? Now, you were the one who said I could tell you anything. Actually, I've kept something from you. Actually, I used to be a... geisha. Don't worry! Geishas are not prostitutes. We perform, but we don't sell ourselves. So, what do you perform? - Sexy dance. - Sexy dance? How much did you earn a month? 150,000 Hong Kong dollars. 150,000 Hong Kong dollars? Will you look down on me? Can... you... perform for me? It's really quite provocative! Turn around... Do it with the mop! Turn... I can't accept myself like this! What do you mean? I can accept you like this! Think it over before coming to me. Sayonara! Wake up! Darn it! Why the cramps now? Mayumi! Yoiji, you didn't come to the cafe. You stood me up. A ghost in the daytime! Help... A ghost... in the daytime! How come? Why did you poke my butt? I wasn't poking. I simply inserted something inside. You were inserting. A Chinese Ghost Story! Be calm. I'm a cyborg from the future. The one that was destroyed was of the same model as myself. She's of the Chan Meiling series. Serial no. 1872-332. I'm the next in line. I'm 1872-333. You're just a cyborg, right? Terminator! Robocop! You believe me? Of course, I do. You're a cyborg. Just like e-mails and mobile phones. When it comes to technology, anything's possible. Even China has its own astronaut. Just let me clear my mind first. Terminator! The invention of the time machine in the twenty-second century... has thrown history into array. There's a soldier missing from the Terracotta Army. John Lennon's death was delayed by two days. My mission here is to... ensure a major historical event happens on schedule. Let me first show you a clip from the year 2054. 1872-333! And so many lines too! Wow! 2054 AD. The Father of Microchips created the HR-815 Chip... and produced the first generation of the Meiling Chan series. What's that got to do with me? On fifteenth of August of this year, the Father of Microchips' brother... will die in the cemetery at Happy Valley. Because of this event... the Father of Microchips struck a courtship with his future wife. To commemorate their love... he used his wife Chan Meiling as the blueprint... to create a series of Chan Meiling cyborgs. And you are the famous Father of Microchips'... brother. You've got to be kidding! In order to keep history as is... I'll ensure your safety until fifteenth of August. At the same time, I'll make sure... you die on fifteenth of August at the age of thirty-three. No way! You've made a mistake! I don't have a brother! My data is never wrong. You're crazy! Crazy! Just admit that you're wrong! I'm sorry. I need to recharge. I beg you! I'm at the prime of my life. You're being so unfair! You don't have to beg me. Cyborgs don't have emotions. We can't be coaxed. We won't be angry. We'll never be sad. We'll never laugh. Sheesh, the heck with you! Sorry, I overreacted. Don't think you can escape, because I've put a tracer in your bottom. I can find you wherever you are. Why me? Just like that? - Hello! - Mayumi, pack up and wait for me! We have to be on the run! It's really bad! Ho Yoiji! Yin! CK! Bo! Good timing! There's a cyborg! Take a look... Ho Yoiji, you're suspected to be involved in the death of a police officer. - Take him away! - What about the robot? There really is one! It's a robochick! What's the matter? You dressed to kill. What did you say? We found these on your desk. You're so stupid, you can't get out of this! Dressing up is so flamboyant! I detest this kind of behaviour! If I did kill, I would have used my own clothes. It's obvious that you're framing me! You think it's a setup? Put the clothes on him! Don't move! Dignity is very important. I won't strip before your lustful eyes. Okay! Seeing you like this, I agree to obey. I'll strip. Come on! I told you I've been framed! Why does this fit so darn well? Do you have a full-length mirror? There's a flaw...! Look, how come it fits so ridiculously well? We're talking about homicide! Why would I dress like my idol Chan Waiman? Why would I do that? Would you? Oh, I know! The man you're looking for must be Chan Waiman. - Chan Waiman? - The heck with you! - Help! - Stop! Madam, help me... This is injustice! Madam, he even killed his own men! - Hands off! - Okay! He is innocent until proven guilty by the court. We can't get our hands on him if he's sentenced! What's the matter? They're using violence. It's against police policy. They don't know the rules. Just give him to me. Yoiji, what happened to you? They set me up! Don't worry, come. Please enjoy. This is for you. I know you like Japanese food. He probably wants to kill me. Officer Ming, check if they're poisoned. You're crazy! Listen to me. Just admit it, and you can go. I've been wrongly accused! I know you didn't do it. I consider you my brother. That's why I'm asking you to admit it. You can't spell in English. You can't read Mandarin. And you can't write in Cantonese. You were born with bad luck, and you grew up unlucky. You had no brains for school, and you're lazy at work. You lack sincerity, and you have no aspiration. Your IQ is not high enough, and your EQ is ridiculous. And your mom is the subject of your ICQ chat! By the way, how's Auntie? - She recently... - Forget it... I just want to ask you one thing. Do you know what the difference is between men and apes? You're a useless man! Why don't you take a chance and admit to it? Cop killer. That's so cool! You'll be on the news, and you'll be famous. You'll be the Big Kahuna in prison. After you come out, you can write your own memoir. You can then sell the rights to Hollywood. In the film, Brad Pitt will play you, and Al Pacino will play me. Think about it. Ten years of youth... in exchange for fame and wealth. The world will be yours by then. Sign it. No, I can't! Why? I'm bad at composition. I can't write my own memoir. You can just dictate it. Sign it. I don't want Brad Pitt to be me. I like Chan Waiman. Okay, then Chan Waiman will be you, and Al Pacino will be me. Now I'm a little more confident about this combination. Sign it. What now? - I feel really sick! - What's the matter? I think the cigar is poisoned! I've been poisoned by ciguatoxin. Stop messing with me! The heck with you! The suspect has escaped! Get out! Help me! Have mercy! If you run, you'll be an escaped criminal. If you're innocent, then face it with courage! How could I when I don't have any? Okay, justice is fair. If you go back with me, I'll help you find the truth. You believe me? No, I don't. I only believe in evidence. I won't let go until the file is closed. Everybody, freeze! Let your hostage go! Ridiculous! Drop your weapons! You're surrounded by me! You don't have a chance! Drop your guns... This posture is beautiful! Hold it and take five steps back! Okay, five more steps! Now hug! Hug! Now smooch! - Don't go too far, scum! - Oh, that's too much. Fine, just feel each other up. You can't escape! I'll catch you! - I'm really sorry! - Hey! - Ho Yoiji... - Sorry... Scumbag! Has anyone seen Ho Yoiji? Has anyone seen Ho Yoiji? Licence check... What's the matter, Officer? Serious matter! Show me your license! Okay... I'll be right back! Owner off to celebrate? Mom... open the door! I'm Yoiji! Mom, open the door! Bright is the moonlight on my bed. Or is that frost? Three times two is two. Nine times nine is eighty something. Three times three is six... Lend me some water, witch. You can't hide away like this. Are you going to hide for the rest of your life? What? You want to fight so early? I'm really tough! So what? You're just squatting here like me. Fly the coop. Stay away for a few years and you'll be a new man. How? Do you know how? Teach me if you're so clever! You don't have to do this. I'll tell you for sure. Go to Chungking Mansion, and look for Ling at unit fifty-one. She'll help you with the passports. It's a one-stop service. Why help me? I'm not! I'm on commission! Tell her Slooberbie sent you! Or else she won't pay me! Slooberbie! Wah... When we save up to 100 million, we'll go live in the Netherlands. Sorry... I'm looking for Ling. She's over there. Cyborg? Didn't I drown her already? - I'm sorry, Ling! - Why did you lie to me? Uncle Ray told me to come. He said you took all his business. Don't let me see you again. Get lost! I'm sorry, Ling... Kid, what do you want? Are you Ling or 1872333? If you need to borrow my phone, it's a no. No... I need a fake passport. The entire package will cost you HK$35,000. Come with me. Quit reading comics at my doorstep! I'm sorry, Ling. Sit here. Look here. What the heck! I give you HK$35,000, and you only take one picture. You should at least give me a makeover. Cyborgs don't have emotions. We can't be coaxed. We won't be angry. We'll never be sad. We'll never laugh. Choose for yourself. It's such a hard choice. Everybody likes me! Doesn't even laugh at Doraemon? Really suspicious! You're so young. Let me tell you a joke. I don't listen to jokes. No, you'll like this one. It's like this. A group of animals are on exile. But they don't have enough food. What should they do? They set up a joke contest. Anyone who cannot make everyone laugh... will be thrown into the sea. The ox is the first one to take the stage. Hey, how am I doing so far? Okay, I'll go on. The ox is really funny. Everyone laughs, except the pig. So the ox is thrown into the sea. Now is the goat's turn. Nobody laughs at the goat's joke. Suddenly, the pig laughs. The others ask him, "What is so funny?" He replies, "Now I understand the ox's joke!" It's such a funny joke, but she didn't laugh. She must be a cyborg. Where do you plan to go to? Must it be Southeast Asia? I don't like it hot. Then hide in the fridge, okay? Sorry... hot is okay. Maldives, please! Then Thailand. Those Sunday markets, Siam Square... Buddhas, lions, tigers, crocodiles, and drag queens. Other than those, there are banana boats and parachuting. What else is there? Those should last you a few days! I know, but I'll be on the run for more than a few days! I'll blow off your mouth now! You're human? What's your name? Chan... Chan Meiling. To commemorate their love... he used his wife Chan Meiling as the blueprint... to create a series of Chan Meiling cyborgs. So this is Father of Microchips' wife... Chan Meiling! Hey, if I get rid of her, then he can't create the cyborgs... and no robots will come for me! But this chick is so tough and she has a gun. How can I get rid of her? I love you! I did all this to get your attention. I've been watching you for a long time. I took this chance to be near you. I haven't left this place for a few years. How could you watch me? I didn't have to use my eyes. I simply heard about you. That was enough to make me fall in love. My godmother always talked about you. She's Slooberbie. She told me to give you our family heirloom. Come with me. Let's run away together. You're breathing hard. Give me your gun. There's a boat leaving tonight at nine. Let's go. Meiling, when will you let your guard down? Those who are following leads, continue to do so. The rest of you enlarge the search area. Within five days, I want all the villages and islands... in Hong Kong to have this questionnaire. Don't leave out any single clue. - Understand? - Yes, sir! Any questions? Yes! Yesterday I returned to where the explosion had taken place. I found something there. Ho Yoiji mentioned in his statement that... he met a robot. I can't say whether he lied or not, but we should examine all possibilities. We should never give up until the file is closed. Let me handle the investigation. - Officer Cheng. - I want you to wait for news here... and arrest Ho Yoiji. But I'm just getting some ideas... Yoiji is extremely dangerous. I want to entrust this task to the one I trust. Understood. Ling, we are a couple. Let me share your burden. Come on baby! Come on! Thanks. Meiling, are there any ghosts in the car? What are you doing? Well, there's a slow leak in the tyre. I'll pump it for you. We'll be together for the rest of our life. What is your name? Ho Yoiji. I see. Poor you. But I don't mind. Okay. Ling, you're here! Since you've seen everything, you can't leave. Come barbeque with us! We're just out of sausages. How about pigeon? You should have told us that we would be on the same boat. We could have gotten a suckling pig to roast. Hey, is it still raw? Should be cooked now. Dig in. Taran. Tino. You're done, right? Hold it. This is the money you gave me. Take tomorrow's boat. He and I will leave tonight. Take my van after you're done eating. Kid, are you messing with us? Even the blind knows that tomorrow is the Thai Queen's birthday. The next boat will leave in two weeks. We've given you so much business in the past. How could you do this to us? Just shut your trap! Do you want the money or not? Son, don't take it! Never be greedy! Dad, I'm over here! Save the talk for the afterlife! I'll burn the money to you! That's ridiculous! Don't move! Drop the gun! There's the boat! Let's go, Dad! Go after it! Meiling, forgive me! What happened? That idiot blew up our boat! You want to ruin everything? Over there, Dad! Don't you dare move! Move if you have the guts! Let my father go! If you hurt him, I'll slice his ear off! We've been in this business for years. Why would we give up because of an ear? If you move again, I'll blow his ear off! Just do it! Worst comes to the worst, I'll be blind and deaf. Just do it! Don't! - I didn't mean it! - Shut up! I didn't want to blow up the boat! Shut up! - Bullets have no eyes! - Just shut up! - Don't be afraid... - Over here, Dad! Let him go! So easy? I want money! Bring me HK$50,000 in half an hour, or else I'll shoot off his Adam's apple! Take me as your hostage! Bring HK$50,000 to save me. Here's a bracelet, anything else? Don't touch my bracelet! Half an hour. HK$50,000. Quick! Nothing stupid, or I'll kill her! If I act stupid, you'll kill her? Yes! This plank is inconspicuous. I can use it to kill both father and son with a smile! Are you messing with us? Stop it! You think you can escape? I can kill you even if I'm blind! Trying to be sneaky? You like to smile? You want to kill us? That's what you ordered! Why is your butt flashing? Why is my butt flashing? What's wrong with it? It's dangerous here. Get in the van. Let's go. Twins? I thought I had removed your legs. How did you come out? My right leg is the charger. My left leg is the battery. You hit my left leg last time, so the battery fell out. I was then immersed in water... and I absorbed electricity through the water. That's why I could move again. Water conducts electricity! I should have studied at school! I didn't mean to hit you. I was just too excited. Do you mind taking me back to where we left just now? I really want to kill that girl. No, it's dangerous to walk around. I've decided to hide you under water in a container. I'll let you out to die on the fifteenth. You're back. Yes, I'm back. Don't worry. Our bracelet is still here. - Where is he? - Upstairs. A boat exploded at about ten o'clock. A taxi driver found a female body. About twenty years old. An artificial limb was missing. When we arrived, we found a guy passed out. We're still not sure what happened. You said you know Ho Yoiji's whereabouts, right? That's what I said! I know who he is with. He's with Ling of unit fifty-one at Chungking Mansion... as well as her twin sister. They are twins! Go get them! Can I cut off your bra? It's more convenient! How come you don't have one on? Don't put too much thought into it. I forgot to wear it today. Why did you cut my clothes off? You're shot. I have to remove the bullet. When did I tell you I was shot? I was knocked down by that idiot, and hurt my back! Then let me massage it for you. Just lie down. You're really living a rather harsh life. I'm an orphan. I grew up in an orphanage. In that world, we all wanted... to be adopted and loved. Finally, someone decided to adopt me. He wrote to me. He's Uncle Longlegs We corresponded regularly. He always encouraged me. I considered him my real father. I would tell him everything in my letters. Whether I was happy or sad, I would let Uncle Longlegs know. I left the orphanage when I was eighteen. I finally had the chance to meet Uncle Longlegs. Ling Ling, do you want curry? Get to work! What kind of work? So I started making fake passports, and arranging getaway details. I had thought of leaving. But I didn't have a family or a home of my own. My wish to make a family here... is really difficult. Where are we going to? Rob someone. All the money's gone. We've gotta get hold of some money for travel expenses. Who should we rob? This is a stick up! Give me all your valuables! Just out of curiosity. Why are we lugging these bags of flour? These are Taj Mahal curry powder. They're worth HK$60,000. What's the matter? What's the matter? Let's go! Ho Yoiji! Ho Yoiji! Don't go! Ho Yoiji! Ho Yoiji, stop! Ho Yoiji! Ho Yoiji! Let's split up. I'll take care of her. Meet you at the entrance. Darn it! I'm lost! Ho Yoiji! Don't move! Have mercy! Answer me one question. Tell me. I found a blue bulb-like object at the explosion site. Can you tell me what that's for? That's the robochick's charger. - What? - Forget it. You won't believe me. - Go on. - You believe there are robots? I've read your statement. It's not totally unbelievable. It's just like when people didn't believe... we would have e-mails and mobile phones. With technology, anything's possible. Even China has her own astronaut. If you believe me, then let me go. If I don't leave Hong Kong by August fifteenth, the robot will whack me. What do they look like? They're exactly like the moles in the police station. You can't tell them apart. But when you confront them, they'll show you their true colours. The cyborg's weakness is its left knee. Just hit it right on the spot and that'll do. Understood. Come back with me to the station! Let him go. I'm really sorry about this. You know we don't want to do this. Yoiji, let's go. Thailand. Time. How much? Which pier? Can it be earlier? - Honey! - I told you to be more discreet. Why are you dressed like this? I'm trying to be discreet. I was afraid the police would follow me. So were you being followed? Someone was following me. Not sure if it's the police. What are you looking at? Give me the HK$100,000 and then go home right away. I'm a little short. By how much? HK$70,000. That's all? Do something to raise more money. Forget it. Look at those two bums. They look poorer than me! Try to get the money elsewhere. I'll call you tomorrow. No, I want to go with you. You're my husband. You've arranged everything so fast? Who is she? She's our lamp in the darkness. I'll talk to her and get a space for you. Don't get it wrong. She's really pitiful. Just like you, she's an orphan. I've adopted her when she was seven. We're very close. She's like a daughter to me. Sometimes we would call each other honey. Only those who are close-minded will misunderstand us. Do you hug a real daughter like that? That's a fatherly hug. I have to or else she can't sleep. Let her come with us. I'll help her get rid of this habit. We'll let her go after she grows up, okay? Why should I believe you? Because of my steadfast look. Get in the car. Yoiji, we have to find a place to stay. I think I have a mom! Mom! It's Mom's signal. There are ghosts around. There are many police here. What should we do? Come back tomorrow. Madam, we've got to close early today. - She said she has to close early. - Close early? Closing up? - Congratulations! - Thank you... You're after my mom? Do come for a few drinks! Getting married. Please excuse us. Please excuse us. Get in the van. Be careful. This way. This way. Be careful. Oh, my mom said to follow her! Go after my mom... - Auntie, good afternoon! - Son! Mom, I've been framed! Beware of spies. Let's talk at our headquarters. - Headquarters? - Let's go! Mom, what kind of HQ is this? Dr Lau designed it. It's for escaping from nuclear explosions. Please come inside. You probably want to know the reason behind this HQ. Our response is, you never know what'll happen tomorrow. There are so many disasters nowadays, so we planned ahead. Just activate the safety measures. If a nuclear bomb explodes... Is there air conditioning here? Yes... Eight people can live here for half a year. That was unexpected. Despite its size, we have everything we need. We have 25,000 cans of meat and fish. As for water... we haven't saved up enough for a water tank. But don't worry. We're using these barrels for the time being. We've sealed them with plastic wrap. We won't use the water unless it's necessary. What would happen if a nuclear bomb goes off today? Is there enough water to bathe and wash hair? Don't underestimate what we have here. This drinking water recycler can distil... human waste into clean water. As for bathing, in times like these, we have to keep it simple. Ladies, wet it and wipe yourself. Change over there and take a rest. Son! So, is it all right? All right... It's only a start, but I can see the dream behind it. This is the fruit of Dr Lau's hard labour. Let me introduce myself... Hold on. Mom, you didn't tell me that you're remarried. You were busy, so your mom didn't want to bother you. We've signed the papers, and we're married. Let's have dinner as a family. Mom! Now that you're remarried, do you and Dr Lau have plans to... give me a younger brother? Have you stopped? Stopped what? - Men... - What? Your menstruation. There's nothing shameful about it. I can tell you. It stopped last year. Everything's all right then! But I had forgotten to tell you... I bore him a son eight years ago. Little brother? Where is he now? Doing experiments in the garden. Really? Mini-man, greet your brother! Brother! Is he sick? He's doing calculations. What is he calculating? I'm studying the sunspot activity westward of the Equator. I want to know if under the influence of gamma rays... an object moving in a straight line at sixteen metres per minute... will reflect a shadow of the sun that can be converted into energy. Mom, I don't understand what he's saying! Each person has his own specialty. Maybe he has inherited Dr Lau's genes. Are you jealous of your brother? I did have the urge to slap him. But now I have this feeling. I have such a terrific brother. I'm so proud of him! - Little brother! - Big brother! What are your aspirations? To become a scientist. What do you want to invent? Probably robots. What kind? Something like Gundam or Evangelion. Brother will sleep with you tonight. Okay, but I snore a lot. Do you mind? Not at all! What the heck! He snores real loud! Was it too loud and woke you up? I made a snoring machine. With the noises as my cover, even if I watch DVDs... no one would notice. You're really something! Who will you thank when you receive the Nobel Prize? Nobel, of course! Very good! Mail him a thank you card, okay? Who are you most indebted to? Who? Me, of course! Fine! Okay... let me ask you another question. What do you think of Ling? The cute one or the sad one? The sad one! She's all right. Remember, when you get to date her, don't choose bare backs for her. She doesn't like it. Also, you must not let her down, okay? Will you die soon? No. Then what's with your death wish? To watch a DVD with you. Okay, let's watch it now. It's even better with your pants off! Really? You take them off first. I've done that already. It's your turn now. Really? You're right! Let's watch a DVD. Have you seen Ho Yoiji? Sorry, sir. He got away. Were you in contact with him, or... can you guess his whereabouts? No. The cyborg's weakness is its left knee. Just hit it right on that spot... and that will do. Officer Cheng, I bought a new pair of shoes. Can you take a look? Actually, they are not very new. Yours are newer! Can I take a look? This is... a police station. Take it slowly. I think there's no one in the evidence room. Don't move! Officer Cheng, do you believe in robots? Why do you wash Yoiji's undies? I always wash his undies. Why does that Japanese girl always wash your undies? No, this is just love between father and daughter. Don't over imagine things. No way. I want to wash them too. Take off your undies now! Do you want some softener? How about bleach? What do you want? You scrub pretty well. You can think about going into the dry cleaning business. I don't know about others, but I think you can do it. Why should I change my job? Promise me. You can only live once. Listen to me. Leave your previous life behind you. Turn over a new leaf. Do you loathe me? I know I'm not like the other girls. I don't know how to flirt, and I'm rough. And I've never had a boyfriend. Meiling, why would I loathe you? I just feel that you deserve a better life. Then let's go on a date. I really want that as well. But shopping, eating out, and watching movies... are rather difficult for us to do as fugitives. How about we do something else? Okay, let's play with guns. Or we can see who can throw a grenade the furthest. Calm down. There are lots of fun stuff we can do. Why don't we play hide-and-seek? Okay, I'll hide first. If... you find me, I'll do whatever you want. Really anything? Meiling... I didn't know you're a ninja! Meiling! Meiling... Meiling! Where are you? Meiling! Meiling... where are you? Meiling... I've gone too far! Meiling, have you fallen off the building? Let me know, Meiling... You found me. Honey, what are you doing? This is what dating is like. She loves you more than a daughter loves a father. It's her problem. I don't mind. Explain it to her. What were you doing with her? Honey! What are you doing? Honey! Put your love affairs aside. Yoiji, hide yourself in a nylon bag. I'll ship you to south of Shanmei. I don't know anyone there! No way! Don't worry, I'll also send Mini-man to take care of you! You're crazy! You're willing to part with this? Son, we're family! Accept our good intentions! I better not! What's the matter, Meiling? - Get inside! - Why? Wash again? What's the matter? Let me out! I'll die from this! Stay away! I'll chop your hand off if you get any closer! Why put him in the washing machine? Whatever it is, let him out first... and deal with him later! She's right! You're killing him! Why did you lie to me? Why does everyone lie to me? I didn't lie to you! You're really killing him! Let him answer your question before you kill him! - Yoiji... - Honey... - Son, come on out! - Are you okay? Honey, look! This is bad! I'm really dizzy! - Yoiji! - Hang in there! Pulling the plug will do. Genius! It's okay now! - Son! - Yoiji... Meiling, what did you ask me? Nothing. Come on out! Try not to say anything! The police have just arrested Officer Zhang Kitt. It's suspected that she has developed... an attachment with police-killing suspect Ho Yoiji. She's diagnosed with Stockholm Syndrome... which explains why she helped Officer Ho Yoiji to escape. Madam has fallen in love with me? We've talked to Senior Inspector Cheng. I have just one thing to say. Zhang Kitt is a disgrace to the police force. - Inspector Cheng... - Give way! Officer Cheng, about the explosion at the pier. We found a female body with an artificial limb. Forensics concluded that it's a mannequin. It's in the evidence room. Sir, can you go and sign the receipt? Sir! This was hand-delivered to you. To: Chief Superintendent of Police Zhang Kitt is innocent. She didn't do it. Please let her go. Secret Agent You've used words from more than thirty newspapers. You've tried your best. Let's go. No way! Officer Cheng must be the one behind this. Why does the boss still trust him? Did you mention in the letter that he's a bad guy? Oh no! I didn't! I'll get another set of newspapers. You deliver the letter for me! Sit down first... Is that really necessary? Why don't you call him directly? Isn't that more convincing? They can locate the line in ten seconds. That'll only give me nine seconds. Why don't you speak to him? Be confident in yourself! Hello, sir? Officer Cheng is the bad guy... Now that's the spirit! Did you dial 133? Why dial 133? Let's go... - Brother, pull down the gates! - Don't move! Don't move! You're our hostages! You either squat down or lie down! Tell the cops that I want a helicopter! Two million US dollars cash! Notes in non-consecutive serial numbers! Plus a PS2, and summer break lasts until Chinese New Year! Or else I'll kill a hostage every minute! Go! Go tell the cops! Little Brother, isn't this a little too much? Big Brother, gentlemen should be cruel. Just grab a construction worker, stab him once or twice... and throw him out. Just so they know we mean business! Little Brother, I won't amount to much. But you will. I don't want to get you involved. Leave! Don't move! - Now you're mine... - Sir, don't... Are you ready? Don't pretend anymore. I know all about your stuff. What do you know? I know you must have a secret. I just don't know what it is. Now I'll ask you the first question. Did you find a bracelet on the day you caught MacGayfa? You did all this for the bracelet? The diamonds were fake. I was almost tricked by it. I'll give you HK$2,000. Just let me go, okay? Tell me where the bracelet is! So this is really about the bracelet! Now I understand! Understand what? There's a secret behind the bracelet. I just don't know what it is. Did you give it to a girl called Chan Meiling? You know that too? Where is she? I won't tell you even if you kill me. Open the door... I'll tell... - So where is she? - She has left the country! Where to? She boarded a boat at Sai Kung this morning. She must be somewhere in Southeast Asia near... Maldives! Thanks a lot! Why does it have to be Maldives? - He has admitted to it. - I was only asking! You can't get away! Go away! Sir, this is Ho Yoiji's lawyer. I'm Ho Yoiji's lawyer. Ho Yoiji didn't make any calls. How did he notify you? My client instructed me this morning that... if I don't hear from him in eight hours... I have to come to the police station for him. Do you think my client is stupid? Just wait. My people are busy. Aren't you tired at all? Ho Yoiji is a serious criminal. We have the right to deny bail. I know. I'll tell you now. He can't be bailed out. Whatever you say! Darling! Follow me! You should have warned me! I can't see! Let's go! The suspect has escaped! Go get them! - Be calm. Pretend it's okay. - Okay. Stop it! Don't go! - I'll tell you some more! - I don't want to listen! What's so funny? Tell me. I won't tell you! - I'll tell you some more! - I don't want to listen... That's Officer Zhang! Let's save her too! Okay... Ho Yoiji! Where is he? - Ho Yoiji! - I'll shoot her! I'm sorry. We wanted to rescue you, but now we're holding you hostage again. I really can't help you this time. Officer Cheng is the bad guy. I'll give you half a minute. Let the hostage go! The police won't compromise with terrorists! Come here... I'll draw their attention. You two go. No, I'll do it. You two go. - Is today August thirteenth? - Yes. Let me go! Wait! It's too dangerous. I won't let you. You're mine. You can't die without my say-so! Trust me. I won't die today. Fools! Fight me mano-a-mano! Come on! Are you afraid? Even with so many people? Come on! Hit me! Come on... 1872-333! Officer Zhang, let's go... Let's go! You go. I'm a Leo. I'll not be an escaped convict! - You guys go now! - Leo, okay! Let's go! - Go... - Let's go! I really invented you? Yes, Father of Microchips. So do you have death rays and projectile fists? No. Can you crack the earth? No, I can't. You're useless! So why did I invent robots? Yoiji, forgive Mom! That robot is useless! She can't do anything! Brat, you have ruined your brother's life! Why don't you shut up! Yoiji, forgive Mom! I shouldn't have brought him into this world! It's not your fault, Mom! You're so sexy. Who could resist you? No! I wasn't loyal enough to science! We shouldn't have combined our DNA that night! Let me give Yoiji my life! No! You can't! I'll join you! Mom! Don't! Put it down! You're so unscientific. The more you pull, the weaker you become. Here, Brother, you pull on this side. Sis, you pull on this side. Pull when I count to three. One. Two. Three! - You brat! - Brat, I'll teach you a lesson! You're running around and making all these noises! Let me die in peace! Why do you have to die? Honey, I don't understand! If I don't, my brother won't be the Father of Microchips. Don't cry! Why must he be the Father of Microchips? Honey, I don't understand! Because otherwise there won't be robots. Don't cry! Why must there be robots? They kill people! They kill because of my death! Don't cry! Why do you have to die? Honey, I don't understand! Don't ask! You think I really understand why? Why did you come after me when you knew I would be his girl? I thought I could handle the robots. If I had killed you, there wouldn't be any robots. You'll be dead on August fifteenth. Why don't you lie to me for just a few more days? You said you hate being lied to. If you hate me, you can love my brother. Love your brother? Okay. I'll make love to your brother now! Come here! Take off your clothes! Take off your clothes... Take off your clothes! If you're afraid of this, how can you spend your life with her? Take it off! Be a good boy... - He's still young! - How can you do this? Oh my gosh! The kid is innocent! How can you do this? That's true. He's still young. You shouldn't have taken it out on him. Then I'll take it out on you! I'm okay with that. But from a moral standpoint, we mustn't... I'll never come back! Let's see how history will handle this! You can go! Give me back the bracelet! Since I can't be your wife, I'll learn to take care of myself. You'll definitely find someone who is better than me. I know, but I thought I would be married in September. Please forgive me that I have to die so young. Don't waste time. You can still go out for a dinner date. You'll have a bright future. I'll leave then. I'll be at your funeral. - Come in! - Morning, sir! This time you have to buy us dinner. Why? With your rate of solving cases... you've been selected as the Outstanding Youth. Interpol, CIA and FBI all want to recruit you. They want you to report on duty at the Pentagon in five days. They'll also give you a Green Card. Remember to mention my name there. Thank you, sir. Let's eat. The fish is ready. Eat, Yoiji. You still have to eat whether you smile or cry. Go ahead and eat all you want tonight. Mom, we don't have much time. Just tell me what you want me to do before I die. I wanted to see you get married. But now... Mom, go find a girl for me... and carry out the ceremony with a lively and good-looking rooster. You better hurry. Otherwise, you won't be able to find any live poultry. What about you? Nothing. Nothing? There won't be anything after tomorrow. Just tell me. I want... nothing. Is this what you want? Dad! Brother, what about you? Can I hug you? Yoiji? Yoiji! They are here... - Hello? - Ho Yoiji, your girl's with me. Meiling! Honey, it's me! Help! It's Mayumi. Bring me the bracelet tomorrow at eleven o'clock. - Where? - Happy Valley Cemetery. I got it! Dad, I have a better wish! Rebuild me! I want to be a superhero for one day! Hong Kong is so beautiful! It's done! It's done! It's done, son! Let's go! Every top superhero... has his own individual weapon. Spider-Man has spider webs. Bruce Lee had his nunchaku. Harry Potter has his magic broom. And our Yoiji has obtained the pinnacle of my life's work. Bang-Bang-Bang! A robot arm! It really is bang bang bang! This Bang-Bang-Bang could read my mind! It could even tell I wanted to pick up the cleaver! This Bang-Bang-Bang... can be controlled by thought. You can will it to pick up whatever you want. - It's as good as your own arm! - Wow! Then why not use your own arm? Brother, put it this way. One must always look the part. With Bang-Bang-Bang in hand... I can probably scare that fool for a couple of minutes. Dad! Mom! Brother! I have to go now. Brother, try your best! You can do it! Meiling? I don't care what will happen in the future. I just know I can't let you die. If you step out of this door, I'll shoot at your leg. Officer Cheng has kidnapped Mayumi. Though it's over between us, I can't let her die. Besides, I've decided to be a hero! I'll duke it out with Officer Cheng! Shut up! I won't let you die. I was going to say this to you in a cool way. It's obvious that even if I wanted to... I couldn't lie to myself. For thirty years, my motto has been, "Live life as a coward." Today is the only day that I could be a superhero. Just let me go. Do you have a date today? Then why don't you come with me? - Let's go. - Wait! I was told that your last wish is to play with marbles. - Yes. - It took me a while to find them. Here you go! Play with them! How does it feel? Play with them... Dad, I'm really touched! You found so many marbles for me to play with. Don't mention it! Meiling, just stay here with your hands on your hips. I'll go over there alone. Why would you need an artificial limb? This is top-notch technology from the future. You won't understand! What are you doing? This is how people give the bird in the future. You won't know about it. Nonsense! Where's the bracelet? I didn't bring it! Since I can't take money and women to my grave... I just want to hear the truth. What kind of a person am I? Actually, you're really quite nice. So am I cooler with or without a beard? Forget it! Why accuse me for what I didn't do? Because you're stupid. Aren't you afraid I'll kill you to avenge Sundae's death? Come on. Just by yourself? That's true. You ran all those casinos, drug trafficking and money laundering business. I feel really sad that you left me out. I didn't touch the drugs or the casinos. They did those on the side. Then you only laundered the money. There wasn't enough to split three ways. It was right to kill him. Exactly. Then you deserve to be rich. You pretended you were me in the Chan Waiman disguise. But how could you fit into the clothes? There were two sets, idiot! Okay, let me ask again. Why are you so in love with MacGayfa? Why are you so determined to retrieve the bracelet? Everything has a reason. Were you a romantic couple? Did you have sex? You must have! You queer! He's so fat. Weren't you afraid you might give him a stroke? Actually, I was engaged to him... two years ago in Hawaii. Officer Cheng, you're on TV! Where is it? Where is it? No need to look for it. The camera's over there. She is not Chan Meiling! She's Chan Meiling series 1872-333! About our conversation. She has transmitted it to all the TVs in Hong Kong. That includes the one in Times Square and all the 3G phones. Darn it! You wanna run away? After all, I'm a Superintendent. What the Internal Affairs is doing... I should be notified about it. Sorry, sir. Split up! We must find Cheng! Rose garden. There really is a rose garden. Don't go after him! Come with me! I promised the cyborg that in exchange for her help... I would die in the rose garden just like history dictates. Come with me! Let's go! How could you shoot me and tell me to go? Meiling, let me go! Why hit my leg? It hurts! Ho Yoiji, will you do as you promised? I did not promise you! Ho Yoiji, let's go. Take care, Meiling. Ho Yoiji! You idiot! The world is ruined! Do you have to be so melodramatic? You have ruined me! Now I can't emigrate! There's no future for this world! Do you have to be so melodramatic? Larger than life people like me think about the bigger picture! Nothing is impossible! Don't move! Drop your weapon! I'll shoot if you resist! That woman has a gun! - Meiling! - Cover me! Meiling! Meiling...! - Scum! - Don't! Are you okay, Meiling? Darn it! My leg! No! I didn't do it on purpose! Why the heck did I take a bullet for him? You're now Ho Yoiji's brother. You're crazy! I'm so handsome! Sorry, US Robot 18503... has just announced that it failed its mission. US history has been changed. Edison invented the light bulb three days ahead of schedule. Edison invented the light bulb three days ahead of time. What's that got to do with me? This is the domino effect of history. In 1879... Edison invented the light bulb three days ahead of time. So people bought light bulbs three days earlier. Because of this, the match girl couldn't sell her matches. She had so much free time that she wrote a love song to her pen pal. Her pen pal's great grandson found the song many years later. He was so touched by it that he devoted his life to music. Ho Yoiji's father was so engrossed in dancing that... he missed meeting Ho Yoiji's mom by five minutes. It was during these five minutes that she met... Cheng Willmark's father and fell in love with him. Why are you suddenly so fat? - It's all because of Cheng! - Cheng? It came out! It's a boy! Give the baby back to me! Forget it! Let's make a brother for the baby. That's good. History has changed. You died saving your brother and became a hero. You'll be all right! Does he still have to die? Ho Yoiji worked hard because of his wife's death. Now, he is the Father of Microchips. Father of Microchips, I have completed my mission. I have to go now. It's great. I told you so. Without my permission, you can't die. I did it. You have to work hard. At what? At everything. You have to make me look more beautiful. And also include this. Sure. You'll be as pretty as angels. It's very warm. I finally have a family. Don't worry. I'll always be Chan Meiling's family. I'll never forget Meiling's words. Soon after, I went back to school. Who will answer this question? I will... Ho Yoiji, go ahead. You'll know the answer if you've paid attention. I didn't bring a calculator, so I can't answer it. Who will answer this question? I will... Ho Yoiji, go ahead. The answer is C! Wrong. Who will answer this one? I will... I will... Ho Yoiji, go ahead. The answer is C! Wrong. D! Still wrong. - B! - Right. Correct. I'm just studying! Why me? I'm only here to study! I'm not in your way! You study at school and play soccer at the club! Grandpa, aren't you ashamed? Trying to be Newton? Go away! You think I'm afraid of you? I like to go, so what? Meiling? I'm not Chan Meiling. I'm Chan Meiling Series Number One. The future you wants me to come here to take you... on a mission. What mission? Go back to August fourteenth to save Chan Meiling. That's great! Where's the time machine? - Hold on tight! - Okay!
