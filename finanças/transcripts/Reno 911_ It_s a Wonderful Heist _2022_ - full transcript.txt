Dear heavenly Father, Jim Dangle is a good fella. Please look after him tonight. Lord, please look after the lieutenant tonight. He's in a tough spot. God, please, when will I get my period? Oh, and if you get a minute, could you look after my friend Jim Dangle? He looks like he's kind of losing it. Oh, Lord. What a year! I got weasel pox and then I got rebound weasel pox, and then I bought all that cryptocurrency because of that excellent commercial with Matt Damon. And then I finally got that Alanis Morissette tramp stamp that I wanted, and the guy spelled it... so close, but not... Not exactly right. Oh, hey, sir? Please don't fuck my bicycle. That's my bike that you're fucking, sir. Hey, sir? Sir? OK, guess what? Joke's on you, that bike seat has weasel pox on it. Oh, Lord. If there was ever a Christmas angel out there, I sure could use one tonight. - Bee! - Ahh! Oh, my God! Terry? No, it's a Christmas angel. It's Terry as a Christmas angel. Yeah, that's my name. - You got new skates. - Yeah. You put mistletoe on your... On my gennies. All the elves gather around, and then they rub it and then I make a candy cane and then snow comes out in their face. - Terry. - What? I'm just having the worst year ever. I hate to say this, but wouldn't the world be better if maybe I'd just never been born? How can you say that? I just did, with my mouth, out into your face. Lieutenant Dangle, do you want to see what Reno would be like if you were never born? Show me, Terry. What do I have to do? It's real simple. Just hold on to my jingle berries. Is this a... your trick... No, this is a trick. No, it's not. OK. Where there's a will, there's a way. Oh, my gosh. Is that... no! Yes. ♪ ♪ Trudy? Yes. She's incomparable. ♪ ♪ Trudy! No, she can't hear you. Remember, you were never born. ♪ ♪ Is that Rizzo? Rizzo! Rizzo, It's Jim! He can't hear you. Oh, right. ♪ ♪ Not on my watch. Go! Yeah! Thank you, everyone! My name is Trudy Wiegel. I love each and every one of you! Let's see what Jones is like if you were never born. Show me no more! Show me no... Holy snot. Jones is the mother-effing Sunday front-of-house manager at the mother-effing Melting Crock? - Oh, yeah. - My God. Hot-cha. Yeah. Oh, my God. They love him so much. He's worshipped. All right, let's fon-do this! Where? Why? Is that Kimball? I would do literally anything if you would get us a table sooner than 45 minutes. Well, maybe I can accommodate you and your little pussy. Oh, there isn't a cat in this cat carrier. There's a snake. And I have a doctor's note that says I'm allowed to bring it into restaurants. Table's ready. Boy, it sure is. Kimball's hot, and she owns a snake? Yes. See, this is what their lives are like if you were never born and fucked everything up! No. No! Terry, don't show me any more. - Wait till we see Clemmy. - No! - And this time... - No! - Brace yourself. - No. No! No. No! Terry, no! Not Clementine! It's real! She was the only photogenic one! And she also owes me $1,500 for spray tan sessions that we were going to split, and then she was like, I'll use half and you use half. No, Terry, no! Yes, look at her. And that's how elegant you would look in this, the Cadillac of all coffins. Did I mention it has Bluetooth in case you're buried alive and want to talk to someone about it, or listen to a podcast? Hi, Clemmy! She can't hear you, remember? I've told you that. Sounds expensive. Maybe you've seen my brand new Suzuki Outback with optional roof rack outside. You're rich, bitch. I'm the best coffin salesman in the Sierras. I know that's right. For some reason, all my husbands keep dying. Wah, wah. I'm sorry for your loss. Oh! You know what I really want to do right now? What? Listen to the Chipmunks' "Greatest Hits" and go pee on Terry. I would love to pee on Terry and listen to the Chipmunks. ♪ Pee on Terry and listen to the Chipmunks ♪ - ♪ Alvin ♪ - ♪ Simon ♪ ♪ Theodore ♪ ♪ I said, Alvin ♪ Both: ♪ Simon and Theodore ♪ Alvin. Simon. Ahh! Urine! Urine! Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! - What? Oh, my gosh! - Oh. Oh. Terry! What? Oh! Where's all the pee I was promised by the girls with big boobs? I think you were projecting all of that. I just heard a bell ringing. Oh, my gosh. Every time a bell rings, an angel gets a tug job. From? Not me. I've been to Tug Jobs Anonymous. I'm in there right now. Don't tell anybody. Who else is in it with you? It's me and Gary Busey's mailman. - Terry! - God! What? What day is it? Oh, my God! It's only a couple days till Christmas! Then there's still time! There's still time to get peed on! Uh, and... and/or other things. - Right, but mainly peed on. - Go. Just go. Go, go, go, go, go, - Asparagus? - Go. - Eat asparagus. - Go. Merry Christmas, dirty old pervert man! Fuck this place. Merry Christmas, Reno! Merry Christmas, weed store! Merry Christmas, you old dildo shop! Merry Christmas, Soup on a Stick! Merry Christmas, frozen dildo shop! Merry Christmas, Genital Decorators! Merry Christmas, paint-your-own dildo shop! Merry Christmas, Animal Butt Plugs! Terry? Were we supposed to get going, Terry? Anyway, your lives were great. Good morning, gang. - Good morning. - Good morning. Uh, this week's briefings are brought to you by Fugly Nubs, the app that gets horrifyingly ugly yet very usable parts of chickens directly to you. Wait, what? The way you eat a chicken, it's skinned, and the pieces... I've never considered them attractive. Well, I'm sorry. The fine print says, uh, "Parts of chickens that aren't even usable in Mexican restaurants." It sounds like this company isn't selling you parts that are unattractive, they're selling you parts that you normally would not eat. Like a triple beak. It's sort of like when you buy a box of fabric remnants, but this is, like, all cysts and... - And gizzards. - And gizzards. If you fry it real hard... Yeah. You... you... you don't even notice. It's all coming out the same hole, you know? There... actually, that is actually their new... Uh, their new tagline. "Fugly Nubs. It's all coming out the same hole. What do you care?" So... Did everybody get the script I wrote for our new Junior Deputy Pageant this year? - Yes, we did. - Yeah. Do I get to be the lead this year? Read the script! Are you playing Jesus again? Yes. We didn't need to read it to find that out. Everybody, please be off-book. We're going to rehearse as much as we can. You want us to memorize this whole thing? No, just your lines. We all have to remember her lines? Damn, how long is this play? We haven't timed it yet. It's long. But I mean, if you guys have ideas for trims, obviously, if you have ideas for trims... I just skimmed it, and I feel like the second half... You didn't skim it. Or the last three quarters could go. Everybody, please read the script. Cindy, did you read the script? Mm-hmm! - What did you think? - Amazing. Perfect. Thank you. That's the only feedback I want. Please sign your nudity waivers, be ready to go. I agree to and accept all nudity in regards to this production, because I am a fan of the truth. All right. We're not allowed to do it this year... you know how we did it in the parking lot last year, and then we did it at the fire station, and the fire station is mad at us. We don't... we don't technically have a venue. Smells there. Jim, if we do have to do it in the parking lot again, can we scare away that lady with the birds? The scary lady who has the birds? Is the... are the birds with her? Uh, I think they're all together. Yeah, she seems to be able to control them. That was last year's Junior Deputy Pageant. I was also thinking, who's the scary guy with the big thing that he was running around? Oh, the big black wang. Yeah. Does everybody see the extremely sad man at the window? Oh, my God. Don't look, don't look, don't look. Uh, make believe we don't see him. I don't want to start working. He looks so sad. - He'll go away. - It seems official. It seems official. No, no, Jimmy, come on! It's our job. Hey, I don't like our job either. Hi, can I... oh, dear. Oh, dear. Hi. Sir? Are you OK? No, come in, come in, come in. Sir. Sir. Sir. Oh, my... wait. Do I know you? It is I. Oh, my God! Are you... Mr. Christopher Richnickie from the Sierra Nugget Mall commercials. - Oh, my God. - Oh, your commercials! ♪ The mall that you love ♪ ♪ When you're on a fixed budget ♪ ♪ You remember it from its famous... ♪ ♪ Silver nugget ♪ That's you! Yep. That used to be a great mall. Thank you. Uh, it's a great mall! Someone has been sending me ransom notes... A lunatic. He's trying to kidnap my silver nugget right from my mall. They've been calling. They have been sending notes. They have been absolutely terrorizing me, and I don't know why. I refinanced the whole mall on that nugget. If I lose that nugget, I lose everything. Gimme. Gimme. I... I... I'm going to make one of those string boards. I'm on this. I got this. Give me that. So many terrible things have happened. We've had to make so many cutbacks at the mall. This is great. This is great. It looks like I'm going to be playing Santa Claus this year... - Oh, my goodness. - Oh. This is the real thing. They've got the cutouts, the letters. And every one of them says Christopher Richnickie. Do you know how long that takes? And he cut out every fucking letter of that name. Mr. Richnickie, one of the stupidest people I've ever met in my entire life... He's talking about me. Just had an incredible idea. We're looking for a venue to do our annual Christmas pageant for the little Junior Deputies. If we could do it at the Sierra Nugget Mall, we could be there in person to protect your nugget from these would-be bandits. Yes. But a pageant would bring customers to my mall. - It could. - That would help me! A wonderful pageant. And also having you there to protect the nugget... That's right. It's like sticking a wolf right in the henhouse. - Thank you! - This is serendipity! Thank you, female Pee-wee Herman! Yes. Well, this is a Christmas miracle! You will give us a venue for our pageant, and we will do the thing that is by definition our job, which is protect your property. This is magnificent. And if all goes well, we could pick anything we want from the mall! That's not allowed. Going to be great. Thank you. This has been the worst year of my life. Wow, you really keep... - My wife has lupus. - Yeah. OK, goodbye. I actually feel like this has been resolved, and you could probably leave now. We... we... we haven't agreed... She can't stand me, and all I am is nice. Oh. Doctors can't even do that. So if you're asking us to kill her... Said you were going to do it, now do it! I just listen to this every day? Every day. A couple of times a day if you can, and while you go to sleep. Let it get in there subliminally. And that is how you live your best life. I can Venmo you. I'm going to give it to you as an act of generosity. - You're the best. - Oh, I know who this is. Sheriff's Department! Um, there's nobody in this box. - Hi, Jackie. - Jackie! Jackie's not here. Please... please leave a message at the tone. OK, hang on one second. Telephone call for Jackie, the transient who's nesting in the book deposit box. Hello? - Jackie? - Yes? Hi, it's Jim from the Sheriff's Department. Oh, hi. Why didn't you just say so? Ni... happy Christmas and nice for you to see me again. Hi, Jackie. Can you come out and talk to us about some business opportunities? The yearbook photo of Jackie, that's actually it. - Right in... - Oh, hey, guys. How's it going? Have you ever been to Marseilles? I'm going to put it all on blue and let it ride. One time I was in Marseilles, and, uh... The tide... When the tide goes out... - Oh, shit! - It smells like this? - That's it. That's exactly it. - Oh, my God. But you've got to be there at low tide in, like, August... Late August, September. Marseilles. Jackie, we're pulling you on five. - We're pulling you out. - On the count of four. - One... - Five. Go! - Two... God! - Oh, shit. Oh, shit. I got it. I got it. OK, I'm good. Got her. Got her. Got her. Did everybody know that it was me? Surprise! We all knew it was you. Oh, Clemmy. Yes. She... she says it's a Christmas miracle. I just wanted to see my friend Jackie because she's my inspiration, both sociology-wise and spiritually. Yeah. Not to mention, look at the fashion. Oh, shit. She was Miss Nevada a long time ago. There's possum shit in my boots. You want to tell us about this little, uh, business you've started over here? Oh, I'm not pulling books out of this for sale, for sure. These are for charity. Two for 10, five for 4, 16 for 22. 52 for three wallet-sized. - OK. - You're just doing work... But you can't get your inventory from the Reno Public Library. These are all library books. We know that's what you did 'cause it says that. How much is this one? Oh, this one is so... Don't put... don't go for my penis, please. This one is very... You were leaning right towards my... What? I wasn't trying to. - Yeah, you were. - Listen. There's no free blowjobs on Christmas! Do you want me to... I'm going to cuff you for your own protection, OK? Just casually, casually. Oh, look at this! She's being so lovely. Here's the problem. But don't... don't... Jackie! Deedle-eedle-eedle-ee. Jackie, I just don't want to see... Jackie. Look at all these dollars. Surprise. You cannot just creep up on a lady at Christmas time... Put that under your vagina, please. And expect... oh, no. Is something crawling out? No. You stay in there. You'll be safe. Are you talking to your snatch? Mm-hmm. Have you met her? She's not friendly. We could either get her in the vehicle. Mm-hmm. Or if we get her all the way into the box, then she's the library's problem. Let's get her in the vehicle. This is gross. They're going to get mad. Let's get her in the vehicle. Why don't you come to the car with me? I have pickles. That's fine. I'll do that. I'm allowing you to hold this. I'm allowing you to hold this! Stop it. Stop it. - All of this! - Oh, fuck! Oh, look. This is my Christmas dress. Is that your... oh, that is very Christmassy. I can't see in my right eye, but it's... I think it's fine. Santa is going to stuff you right in this little thing here. Santa's gonna stuff me? - Yeah. You're good. - Yeah. Don't... stop. I've been dreaming about this. Stop it. I've been dreaming about this! Santa, stuff it! Here. Oh, Santa, Santa. Oh, what child is this? And God bless us, every one. Record time getting her into the thing. Don't you think? - Because we listened... - Because we listened! - To affirmations. - The affirmations! - Yeah. - I think it helped. Still there. So Dangle has us patrolling the mall in shifts to, um, keep an eye on the nugget, to make sure that nobody steals it. I think Mr. Richnickie is just being a little bit paranoid, and, quite frankly, a little bit dramatic, about someone wanting to steal the silver nugget. I mean, it's like, why would anybody want this thing? Right? What is it made of, cake? Actually, has anybody checked? Because they are making some pretty weird shit out of cake lately. If you want something stolen, put it in a display like this. If you put it... You're begging for it. You're begging for it. I would steal this. I would steal this and I would sell it in my Etsy shop for $25,000 plus shipping, calling it a meteor. And someone would buy it. You're right. Oh, no! - Whoa! - Hey, hey, hey! Oh! Oh! First my wife has lupus, now this? Wait, that's what you called us here for? No! Someone put a live adult male chimp inside of my Santa sack! You put a... whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Get back! Get back! Stay away from my nugget, you dirty monkey! Where'd he go? Hey, hey, hey. This is Jones. Uh, I'm at the Sierra Nugget Mall. I need backup. We've been chimp-sacked. - Chimp-sacked, copy. - What? Explain to them what happened. Where'd he go? - I don't know. - What happened? - We lost him. - We lost him. - Excuse us. - Excuse me. Excuse me. - Watch it. - Jim! - Excuse me. - Jim, right here! - Careful. - What's up? We're getting chimp-sacked? Yeah, we got chimp-sacked. How do you know this term, chimp-sacked? We got an adult male chimpanzee in a sack or a satchel, some kind of bag. Chimp-sack. What's there to not understand? It's a chimp in a sack, right? No, I get that, but... - Like jaguar-luggaged. - What? That I don't know. That's not a thing, either. Why are we all being so loud? Why are we being so loud? Poke him with that stick. Maybe make other chimp noises or something? - No, no, no. - Bad idea. I think he's very close to falling... ♪ Asleep ♪ Both: ♪ Little chimpanzee ♪ Guys, guys. He's fall... he's fallen over. He's asleep. He's asleep. Oh, crack his little skull. Oh, give him a little skull crack. Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! What are you doing? Why did you shoot the elf? Fuck you! Jim! No! No! Look away! Look away from this! Oh, my God! Do something! I gotta... Jim! Help me! You son of a bitch! I just want to remind you that you shot my friend! - My God! - You shot Keith the Elf! Oh, my God, you killed him! No, no, no, no, no. No, you didn't kill him. One tranquilizer dart is equal to three Quaaludes, OK? Are we talking about getting some Quaaludes? Is that what we're talking about? Well, I'm just saying a tranquilizer dart is... - Please don't fuck me. - Wait, wait, wait, what? - What? - What did he say? Please don't fuck me. The last time Keith got knocked out at work, a whole bunch of people tried to fuck him. So I think that might be the concern right now. Please don't fuck me. That is definitely the concern! Nobody's got eyes on our chimp sack? Get it in! Follow it. Follow it. Trap it in. Trap it in. Get in there! Don't you my Keith. Nobody wants any parts of that. You know, it's like that thing where you say, don't think of elephants. Now everyone's thinking of fucking Keith. Don't fuck Keith! Does everyone remember the oath that HR made us take? And I won't show my wiener to anybody. I will not show my wiener to anybody. No such thing as a penis oath. - What are we doing? - Oh. Oh, we were just taking an oath that we wouldn't show people our wieners. Yeah, yeah. Well, we had a situation with a... Yeah, there's a chimpanzee running through the mall. Chimpanzee. It got into the Santa sack and, uh, we don't know where it is. It's all part of a terrible ransom. You're being chimp-sacked? - Not a thing. - The adult male chimpanzee has nine times the grip of that of a male adult. The secret is, you have to be a chimp of a higher status. It's a status game, mates. Watch and learn. He's over here, behind the... He knows what he's doing. This is good. All right, this is no good. You need, like, a moose or something. A reindeer is not big enough. - OK. - Not big enough. - Bigger chimp. - Bigger chimp. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Status game. - Oh, yes. Yeah, OK. - Come on. Come on, chimpie. OK, OK. Oh. Oh, no, no, no. That sounds... that sounds bad. Oh! Oh, he's OK! He's got a bit of fight in him, that one. All right, different tactic. I want him to think that I'm a female. You, you. I need some musk. This way... this way... OK. - He'll think that I'm a woman. - That works. That works. Not enough. Not enough. Oh! You want some? Oh. - OK. - Hey. Oh. - Guys, it's totally standard. - That'll do it. He'll like that. He'll like that. OK, good. You're welcome. Maybe. Santa, come here. You smell like a woman. It's funny, because usually when a man sticks his arm up my crotch, I get his name first. Now it's time for the tender trap. OK. Godspeed. Oh, you go... you go, girl. Not in there! Put him down. - Is your foot in it? - Leave it, no! No! Ahh! Oh, oh. He's in... - Ahh! - Oh, he's alive. - Oh. - He's alive. I got him. I choked him out. You choked him out. Oh. He's not going to bother you anymore. He's a nice fella. Just needed a bit of love. Oh. Thank you, brave sir. - You're a hero. - Brave sir. Oh, thank you so much. Your items. Ah, wow. Wow. Uh, let's... is this dumb? Can get a... can we get a snap with the squad? Oh, yeah. That's a great idea. Come on, come on. That's great. Whoops. Can everybody go, "whoops"? That's great. - Hey, hey, hey! - Oh! Oh, you got him, Jim! I'm OK! It's a Christmas miracle! Let's get the photo. Season's greetings! Season's greetings. Only three days left to Christmas. Bargains are abound. Does anybody want an Ice N Tasty? No, I need one to put on... To ice my tasties. Morning, officers. Morning, morning. - Well, hello there. - Good morning. Thank you for your service. We saw what you got up to this morning. Oh, yeah. We got, uh... uh... Chimp... you got chimp-sacked. - We got chimp-sacked. - We sure did. My name is Gunner. And my name is Ronnie Donald Ceviche. And I am Hold 'Em. And I am Fold 'Em. Yeah. We are the current stewards of the Kenny Rogers' Life Exhibit. Is this some kind of traveling Kenny Rogers museum? Some kind? This is the traveling Kenny Rogers museum. We're talking too much. It's almost time to start our show. - Oh, oh, oh! - And... Born 21 August, 1938, Kenneth Donald Rogers, known to his family as Kenneth Ray, went on to be nominated 19 times for a Grammy and sold over 121 million records worldwide. This is the exact size Kenny was when he was this size. - Child-size Kenny. - It looks just like him. It looks just like him. And he grew up in poverty, surrounded by rats. No. That's not a rat, sir. That is a nine-banded Texas armadillo. The Texas tank. Well, this was amazing. I wish there was more to see. Oh... oh, there is more! Oh, wow. Oh, whoa! Whoa! Kenny Rogers stood at least 6 feet tall. Rumor is, he never looked down on any man, but every man looked up to him. Look, look. I'm big enough that if you skinned me, Kenny Rogers could wear me. Your brain works weird. I like it. This has all of Kenny's songs in Japanese? Yep. All of them. Why? - Is this a suit that he wore? - Well, this... Just like everything you're about to see... Is something that Kenny actually wore himself or is a pretty accurate just this side of replica. This is a replica that Kenny would have worn, had Kenny worn a replica like this one. - It would have been this one. - That's right. Kenny grew up really poor. He couldn't afford a kitty, so he had a baby goat. They nicknamed him Smitty. This goat feels like hard plastic. Is that what that is? It is. That's what that is. This is not even a real goat? I mean, it's a goat in there, but we lacquered it. And then after a while it started to delaminate, so... Magnificent. Also just a test of, could we laminate a goat? Yeah. Well, you never know until you try. OK. Hi. I don't see anybody. Let's do this quick. - OK. - Ready? Both: One, two, three. All right. So the plan is, we call... We call animal control. Right. And they come pick this thing up. - Yeah. - Right? Yeah. And it has a very happy life somewhere in some... in something that looks like a Tarzan set, right? Or... or we leave it here, and it just can run free. That's right. You know, it's like a jungle. It's like a concrete jungle. We're releasing the monkey in the concrete... - Hello? - Hello? Hello? - Oh! - Oh, my God. Oh, my... - Hey! - Keith! - Hey, man. - Where am I? What are you doing in that sack? What am I doing in that sack? We got... what's he doing here? Did you guys tranq me? Wait, if you're here, then... Who'd we drop at the strip club? You can take me to the strip club. No, no, no. You stay here. We should go. We'll check it out. - Yeah. - We should go. I got to go home! I know my wife's worried sick! She's bigger than me! Is this what I think this is? If you think this is Kenny Rogers' bones, it absolutely is. Please no flash photography. I can only keep it open in little spurts, much like a Caravaggio. Three, two, one. Oh, whoa. We just saw Kenny Rogers' bones. - That is possible, yes. - Yes. Can I... should we all switch? I would love to see the bottom. Oh, yeah, please see the bottom. Kenny Rogers' bones. Please no flash photography. This side is even better. The bottom side is incredible. His voice resonated inside that skull. There's still cards in his hand. - Wow. - Yeah. The kind of cards Kenny Rogers would have held in his hands, had he died lying down. Amazing. I will say, having just seen his wingspan, this is the full-size Kenny? We should admit that we do have the same parent company as the Body World show. Oh. - Remember that? - OK. Was that, like, the muscle dudes that played volleyball? - Yeah. - Exactly. So there is some cross-pollination where, you know, well, we share a warehouse. Sure, of course. Let's not tug each other's nuts right here. They may not be Kenny Rogers' bones, but they remain bones, mostly human bones. Let's not tug our own nuts. No. Let's not allow anyone walking by to get a nut tug. Bones. Human bones. - Kenny Rogers had them. - In the shape... In the shape of Kenny Rogers. You know what? I'd kind of like to see the top half again, would that be OK? Oh, yeah. Please. Please take your time. You said pièce de résistance two or three times. Yeah. This is clearly the pièce de résistance. This has been wonderful. We'll just come by anytime, and you guys can show these? Any time you got $38, you can come right on by here. - Again. - Wow. ♪ Oh, the little Junior Deputies ♪ ♪ They came up to your knee ♪ ♪ But how'd they turn out? ♪ ♪ Take a look-y and see ♪ It's Christmas, and the Reno Junior Deputies program has never needed your funds more than right now.

Now, I have asked Jones and Cindy to join me today. Mr. Richnickie of the Sierra Nugget Mall has had some threatening letters sent to him saying they're going to steal his silver nugget. So I have started what we call a string board. This is how all great crime is solved. What we're going to do is find possible connections to the potential theft of the silver nugget, so if it gets stolen, and if we figure out who stole it, perhaps we connect it to something that fucking matters. We got OJ. I don't want to get into it again. Who did this? What's this? That's a coconut nut cluster wrapper I put up there. That... maybe a wrapper... What's the connection? Maybe... maybe a wrapper did it. You're just saying what you think I want to hear. - Hi. - Hey. - Hey, Riz. - Hey. What's up? Sorry I'm late. Oh, you here to work on it? You just told me to show up here. You know who could be guilty? Oh, good. Yes. Who? In Reno, almost... everyone. All right. No. - Oh, no. - Oh, Lord. - Merry Christmas! - Yep. It's Big Mike. Is he huffing on them fumes? Sheriff's Department, Mike. He's got a flocker. He's got a flocker. Got a flocker. Mike, put that flocking gun down. Whoa! Mike! Hey! Whoa! Hey! Hey! Hey. Stop it! Don't... have you been huffing that? - Everyone is so... - You can't... Mike, don't huff that. Don't huff that. Mike, that's bad for your health. I'm a monster! Right. Mike, stop it. - Mike, stop. - Mike, stop it! Stop it! Stop it! - What is that stuff? - Hey, I'll flock you... I'll flock you up. I'm fucking... do it. Give me... give me one. Give him the snowball. Here you go. Hey! Guess what kind of call we got on the telephone. Man partying in a parking lot? - No. - No. Man having a sale? Man selling flocked Halloween ornaments at discount price? This is definitely all the stuff that got stolen from the Halloween stuff. Oh, yeah, 100%. I recognize that spider 'cause I wanted it, and it was $64. Well, how much is it now? Hey, Mike? Mike, how much is the spider? 21.99 for the spider. Really? For the whole spider? Think up on top of your Christmas tree. That sounds like a pretty good idea. 21.99 for me. Mike, what happened to that vehicle over there? That's my race car. - Is that your vehicle? - Yes. And the paperwork would be in it that would show that this belongs to Big Mike, and not Brenda? Wait a minute. Did Brenda help you steal everything from the Halloween stuff, and... stop it, Mike! Mike. Mike. Mike. Mike. Stop it. Is Brenda dead in the trunk? Brenda was called to serve the Lord. That's why she moved to Hot Springs, Arkansas. To serve the Lord. - She was not with you when you robbed the Halloween store? No! Absolutely not! I've met Brenda, and she's a godless troll. Well, that's what happened. See, those make the best preachers. The ones that start out as whores and drug dealers and pedophiles and ass-rapers and dick smokers, and then they go, I'm dub... done with my dicks. I'm going up there for the Lord. And she has a kennel... I'm going to need to check that vehicle. She has... no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You don't got to check that kennel. I'm happy for her, actually. She's doing so well. Well. Found her. Yeah, Brenda's in there. - Let's go, Mike. - All right. Good Lord. I'm going to throw up real quick. Do you think we have time to stop by the Thanksgiving store? Absolutely. OK. We've been here for about nine hours working on the string board, and we are making progress. Uh, guys, you want to run through what we've excluded so far? Jesus, DEVO, OJ, Mark Fuhrman, the Black Dahlia. We also... remember, we found out that's not a... that's not a microchip. It's seaweed. I knew that going in. But we have eliminated some of these possibilities. It's come to my attention, uh, that I think we have not been looking at... where there's smoke, there's sometimes fire. And I know everyone said they don't know Mr. Richnickie, is that correct? - Yeah. - Mm. I mean, you know him, because Reno's not a big town. I mean, I know him. Not a big town. I wouldn't say that. Jim, I will say we're on the same bowling team. You're on the same bowling team. It's right there. So you obviously know that Richnickie and I own a balance beam and jump rope play place, which is not thriving. And, um... so what? I know him. And I have a small business with him. And he owes me some money. We were in a band. We dated the same woman for... a little while. And that woman was my mother. And the, uh, third investor in my balance beam and jump rope business. To be clear, I think what interested her is the low overhead and the small initial investment. It is a great idea. Then why do you need so much money from other people? Because I'm generous. We should take all these guys down... Oh... oh, I don't know about that! - And put up all of us. - No, no, no, no, no. This is... Declan! - Like, even as a background... - Holy shit. Guys, guys, guys. Sorry. I think I found a clue. Listen, I don't know if it has something to do with these notes or not, but I found this in the parking lot and I think it's a clue. Pig in a jar! Yes, it's a clue! We don't get this every day. It's a clue. It's not just a clue. It's also a warning. How many pigs are there supposed to be in the story? - Three. - How many aren't here? Two. Someone who should be an ally is, in fact... Someone with two faces. - Someone... - A two-faced pig is betraying the other two pigs. And a piggy... Where does piggy go? Where does the piggy go? The market. Went to the market! Guys, what do people call us? Pigs. We need to go to the market. These little piggies go to market. I cracked it! I grassed it. Fantastic. You're undercover, we're all... Hey, guys? - Yeah. - The board works. The board did work. There it is! What are you guys doing messing with my face soup? I put it outside 'cause it needs to cook in the sun, like sun tea. That's why I left it in the parking lot. So this is not a clue that we're supposed to go down to the market? No! White people, always taking your stuff. - Yes. - Am I right? Yes, they do. Yes, they do. Face soup. Face soup. - Face soup. - You know what? Now that I think about it, I've seen your ads for it on Facebook. Yeah. - Ooh. - Just a weird odor. I like it. Oh, I like it. Oh, that feels good. Ugh! It's... it burns the back of my throat. My whole mouth is cold. I mean, it's got a nose... There's a little bit of nose in mine. It's another beautiful day at the Sierra Nugget Mall. Thank you, ma'am. Tell your friends who have money to come back and see us. Yes. Kenny Rogers! - Kenny Rogers. - Hello. Right this way, go ahead. Hello. - Sheriff's Department. - Hey. Guess who is back. Ugh. Ugh, son of a bitch. Come on, man. I saw them. They came through. Hola! - Past the dino, and... - Donde esta? Come out, come out. Hello. Donde esta? Hello.

Ahh! Don't hit the cock! Oh, sh... Let's take a break. It's a ghost. It's a ghost in there. A ghost? - In here? - A ghost? - A ghost. - Come on, now. - What's the spirit look like? - A old white lady. - OK. - Old white lady. Leave that ghost alone, T.T. Don't beat up the ghost. - No, no, no, no! - No, T.T.! Get away from me, you old ghost! - Don't go behind there! - No, no, no, no, no. Don't go behind there! No, no, no! Where did she go? Get away from here, you old white lady ghost! - No. - I see her! She's right here in the front! T.T.! I got her. Hey, stop it! Hey! Hey, hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Hi, guys! Dangle! Did you get the call, or... About the ghost? No, T.T. T.T.'s in here. Oh, no, no, no, no. Oh, I'm sorry, guys. No, no. I've been using this place instead of a gym. Uh, the fancy gyms want $20, $30 a month. I'm not going to pay that. Yeah. I can come here. I'm getting exploded. - Stop! - No! I got to do, like, three more laps. So I wish you bonne chance, and please watch out for the ghost. I'm going in. T.T.! T.T.! - All right. We lost her. - We lost her. - T.T.! - T.T.! Oh, I got her. I got her! Happy birthday, Eddie! Did they do the birthday cake yet? I hid in the maze like they told me. OK, um, why don't you wait for Eddie? Psst. Psst. Come here. Come here, come here, come here, come here. That wristband she has on? We haven't sold that color for, like, two years. - Old white lady ghost. - Old white lady ghost. - Yeah. - Go, go, go. No, no, no. Don't leave me. Hi, ghost! Father Nicholas has left me a splendid box this Christmas morrow, and inside, just what I asked for... A real boy. ♪ Happy holidays ♪ ♪ Reno ♪ I quite frankly think that Mr. Richnickie might be making up the whole ransom note thing, and someone wanting to steal a silver nugget. I do. And I can't blame him, because I once sent ransom notes to my own parents, pretending like I had been kidnapped. And they did not respond. You know, I did some background on Richnickie, and I don't know if this is something, but I think it might be. 20 years ago, he had a car wash, and the way he used to get people to come to the car wash was he had some rhodium displayed in a Plexiglass case. If you don't know, rhodium is the most precious metal. It got stolen as well. Anything? Hi, how are you today? There you go. All right. Now, you're not going to believe it. That's the Sierra Nugget. Can you believe it? She's my pride and joy, and she's insured for a fortune. Beautiful. We have been in the Christmas pageant a whole bunch of times, and it was a'ight. But now... Get ready for this, because Dangle came up with an idea for us to top what we did last year. We got live doves! Live doves. We have, uh, dove catchers ready to go. - Yep. - Dove Station Alpha. - Doves fly out. - Check. Check. Hey. Ho ho ho. Dove Station Zebra. Check. After the Christ child is born... I'm the Christ child, of course... We will then release the doves. Get ready. Right, we all ready? Y'all get ready. It's got bubble wrap. Save the bubble wrap. I like... I like bubble wrap. Huh. One alive, one frozen alive, one dozen. There's lots and lots of them, and they're very cold. It says you have to reheat the dove. They came over in a shipping container, right? Oh, that makes sense. Oh, look at him. He's walking around, and then he's flying. This is not... actually not that hard. All we got to do is warm up, uh, 120 frozen solid doves. I'll stick it down my shirt. That always works on everybody. OK. I'll try that. Once they start waking up, be ready. Jim, I got to say, I think these are dead. - They're just flash frozen. - No. Mine is not coming back yet. If anything, it's like it's necrofying my skin. - Oh, my God. - I heard this is how the first avian flu started, by the way. That's probably very, very true. Oh, oh, oh, oh. No, no. Ooh! Oh, my gosh. Starting to smell like chicken. - Any luck? - No. Well, I thought I saw something move, but... I had... I had a little feeling on this guy for a minute. Wait. No. So close, so close. Wait. Nope. I'll be back. Keep the faith. My worst experience with the Junior Deputies was when I got taken hostage by them. Their demands were they wanted better living conditions and food. I got released once we agreed to expand their kennels by 25 square feet and raised the fill line on their dishes by an inch. Have a lot of our adult deputies gotten hurt by the Junior Deputies? Of course. Did Trudy get rabies from one of the Junior Deputies? Yes. These are youngsters, often, that were maybe left at the station, and you can't judge them the way you would a normal person. And we've asked a judge to do that many times. And they say, no, these are children. Aaand away we go! Hi, Junior Deputies. My name is Deputy Trudy Wiegel, and I am going to take you on this magical sleigh ride to see a wowser of a holiday pageant. Which was written by my friend and sometimes lover, Jim Dangle. Sir, I'm gonna... I'm gonna need to have you sit down. Um, OK. It's ma'am, but obviously that's apparent. We stay in our seats because this is the safest bus in the West. When I say safest bus, you say the... Did some... Did somebody bring nuts on this bus? This is a nut-free z... zone. Ahh! You're a nut-free zone, right? What the hell? I'm deathly a... Allergic to n... nuts! She's very dramatic. Holy shit! Are you OK? Oh, my God, that's so gross. Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! ♪ ♪ Declan's got an idea. We're going to try tasing the dead dove. I'm only doing this because I wanted to get out of the briefing room, where everybody has a dove in their crotch. Really? Is it stuck? No. I can help you with that later, if you like. I'm good. Ta-dah! So we went in the evidence room and got a little bit of the white lady. A little bit of, uh, yo-yo. A little bit of the white horse. A little bit of that, uh, Bea Arthur. Cocaine, if y'all don't know. We... we got some cocaine. Uh, Cloris Leachman. OK, OK. Is that the nose? Here you go, little birdie. OK, now, let me make him snort it. Hold on, hold on, hold on. Oh! Heard you guys gave c... cocaine to the... - Yeah. - Yeah, cool. This guy's coming along. This guy's coming pretty good. Is it happening? I think so, yeah. - Jim, you want a little? - I would. I would. Are we talking about that, or are we just doing it? Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. I think that helped. I think that did help. Oh, that definitely helped. - You or the dove? - Everybody. Everybody.

Anyways, we're about to do it again in Carson. That's right. 'Cause they got a Le Creuset. - Oh! - Oh! - What's that? - Let's go, brother! Move out. Move out. What the hell is going...

Hey, doesn't mean you can't hook some jumper cables up to their nipples, huh? Hey, were you in Mossad? Because this is great idea. Or what about stick some stuff up their butts? Best sixth night of Hanukkah... - Ever. - Ever? - That we've ever had. - I guess. Well, I think Mr. Richnickie is going to be still a bummer. But let's get it back to him, shall we?
