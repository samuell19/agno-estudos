Welcome to our show. It's Virginia Woolfpack! Best friends forever. People you can share everything with. Party! I thought nothing could ever come between us. Especially not a guy! FEATURING ELLA What the... Mom? - Mom? - Hey! Stop shouting! What the hell happened here? I have no idea. But I'll be busy here for a few hours, so this is a real lifesaver. He's driving me nuts with that noise. Got a spare pair of gloves? Ella, what about the physics exam? But on your own, it'll take you until the day after tomorrow. And I'm totally in the groove! What did they do to you? This room is a no-go zone for cleaners. Are you new? What's all that mess downstairs, ALF-MK? - "Hangover" part 8? - You're paid by the hour, right? Holy Joan Jett! - Is that a Les Paul Custom? - Yeah. It was an apology gift from my Dad. He ditched Christmas 2018. - I think. - You poor guy! This isn't a museum. - So... - So? Bye-bye, butterfly! Oh, fuck, fuck! I'm gonna be late! I'll deal with the rest. Kiss? Now go! Thanks. - Bye! - Bye! Smart home: close gate. Ha-ha, very funny! I don't have time for this shit! WHAT IF WE JUST SAVE THE WORLD? If the world ends, I definitely want to be right here when it happens. Happy place! The world won't end. You worry too much. Were you waiting long? - We're not waiting. We are. - Hi! Sorry, we can start now. Take it easy, Ella. It's fine. Take a deep breath. - Okay. - I have an idea here. We could sing it in the new chorus. It's about lonely stars. It's really beautiful. - Over the riff we played yesterday? - Yep! Can you give me a G? - Yeah. - And, go! One, two... Look, above us all They're shining way up high Like diamonds in the sky Diamonds in the sky Look, they're beautiful Out of reach for everyone They will shine alone They will shine alone Oh, how they dazzle Until they burn Whenever the light goes on Once again you're gone Lonely, lonely Lonely, lonely Lonely star! When we're stars, we definitely won't be lonely. Anyway, I vote that we enter it for the song contest. Fame! But the song's about fame being vain! I mean, money and success just make you an asshole. And what about our exams? - We'll manage both. - Be the best in the contest... - Graduation and first prize? - We can do it! Okay! Got it. If it's really that important to you. Does that mean we're gonna sign up? All for Ella! Sandwich! Go! Three, two, one... Okay, but don't cry if they reject us. Mr. Boeblinger-Moll? You look really... You look great today. So... crispy. - What do you want? - The rehearsal room. Every day... or night. Any time it's possible. Do I look like the secretary? Aren't you feeling well, Mr. Boeblinger-Moll? Sure. I feel wonderful. Yesterday we agreed that my dear wife Yvonne gets the house and car so she can go to "Yoga with Patrick" five times a week. But hey, I get to keep Spanky and he can keep pissing all over my carpet. Is Spanky your dog? He has eyes that say, "You're hitting 50, and no one will ever love you again." You can have the rehearsal room today, Wednesday and Friday. And I need the electric guitar. Next Saturday. I have bad news for you. A few fifth graders got hold of the guitar. Now it sounds like a constipated grizzly. How am I meant to play this? How about we mic up the ukulele? Got any better ideas? We sent in the acapella version anyway. It'll be fine. Look, above us all They're shining way up high Like diamonds in the sky Diamonds in the sky Look, they're beautiful Out of reach for everyone They will shine alone They will shine alone Oh, how they dazzle Until they burn Whenever the light goes on Once again you're gone Lonely, lonely... Tim? I can see you. That's a really great song. You can't film without asking. You'll need great footage if you enter the contest. If I link you well, you'll have a solid fan base by Saturday. But I need content. And vintage is THE hot shit right now. He's right. It'd be nice if more people than just our 20 followers and Tim listened to our music. Your channel's on the up. Great. I can't say that about my riffs. How are we gonna win the contest with a ukulele? If we want to solve the equation for the half-life T1/2... There's a zero on the left and right side that we can cross out, which leaves E to the power of minus lambda T1/2... Logo! For the band! Tasty pizza every day Lots of toppings, that's the way! Princess Parma and Prince of Cheeses Cook the pizza until it pleases. Fresh from the oven in a whirl Just for you, dear birthday girl! My vegan heart is bleeding. Happy birthday. Fuck! Oh, shit! I mean, cool... Sorry. Oh, my God! We're in! Virginia Woolfpack on the big fucking stage, man! What's going on here? Be quiet! Oh, my God! I don't believe it! I'm sorry. I'll be right back. Hello? You don't get paid for group hugging. Are you hungry, wolves? Planet Reality calling teens, come in! PIZZA TOWER Hold on... Up here. The modified rate is z times r squared, right? - There's no way I'll graduate. - Ell? I'm allergic to self-pity, you know? I'm too dumb to do the math on this shit. If the music doesn't work out, I'll start here full time. You want to win that damn song contest, right? I won't go on stage with you if you say my best friend is dumb! You're smart. And tough. Remember that vow we made in fifth grade? That we're all gonna graduate. And we will, okay? - Promise? - Yeah. Hey, bro! - It's loud. - This is Insta-story art in the making! Okay, thanks. But I need a real guitar for the song. - Hey, there. - Hi. Everything okay? - Hey, I... - No horrible news, please. No, it's nothing bad. I wanted to ask if you could cover me again. - Tomorrow. - I can't do it tomorrow. I have to get hold of a guitar. Me and the wolves are entering a contest. Ella, we discussed this. Don't push the music thing so much. Anaïs is helping me with physics. It's fine. Honey... Graduation is important for your future. Yeah, but the song contest is better for my future than working as a cleaner! We finally got an appointment for Tim with that fantastic healer. - I'm really sorry. - Sorry. Don't be silly... it's great. Yes, next Saturday. And you didn't leave a spare key? Thanks anyway. Bye. Yes, I already spoke to the Flintbones. They need their guitar themselves. Sure, I'd take really good care of it. Thanks anyway. Oh, no! What? I am rich Big balls, bitch! Got it all Gibson guitar on the wall Life ain't fair, it's true Low tide for me, and high for you High, yeah, yeah Gucci plaid so fair Your world's made of gold Na-na-na, your gold Ten thousand square feet of gold Yeah, gold Look, it's all made of gold Gold in your glass Gold in your veins Gold around your neck Golden your cage Your world is so shiny But for me it's tiny 400 square feet is my fucking reality Na-na-na blue I'm gonna get out of here soon 200 miles an hour Through concrete I'll flower And the city's lit up blue I'm gonna get out of here soon 200 miles an hour Through concrete I'll flower The city's lit up blue I'm gonna get out of here soon 84 BPM Till everyone knows my name Na-na-na, purple bills Na-na-na, purple bills It's raining purple bills Purple, purple bills Fuck, fuck! I told you this room is off limits. I was just dusting for your Lordship. It looked like you were having a ball in my studio. Full on. No. Okay, maybe a bit. It was... pretty angry. Good angry. The city's lit up blue I'm gonna get out of here soon 200 miles an hour Through concrete I'll flower - Delete that right now, dude! - Whoa! - Delete it. Come on. - No. No way. What do you want for it? What do you mean? What do you want to do with it? I guess you make a hundred for cleaning? A hundred... 11 euros an hour, you unworldly rich kid. So for cleaning up all that shit from your party we made... Less than 80 euros. - Shit, man! - Okay. Then for your voice, I'd be willing to give... 80... Thousand. Million... Or the guitar. The guitar? It has sentimental value for me. For me too, perhaps. What do you want to do with it? Play in front of 500 people, write hits, and win a song contest. A song contest? Okay. What? You're really giving it to me? Drink to it? Mrs. Haller? Ella? - Er... - Your mom! Put this on. Oh, are you Ella? I advise you not to get too familiar with that spoiled young man upstairs. Are you done? - Yes. - I want to give your mother a cash bonus. We had some guests over last week and it was a bit... - Young entrepreneurs party hard. - Sure, Mom. The "young entrepreneurs". Well, I have to go. Don't "Mom" me! Until you show a little gratitude for me dragging myself to board meetings to finance your hobbies, there'll be no "Mom" here. Bye. Bye-bye, butterfly! Wow, man! I was almost as fast as you. - Wow. Is this where we're playing? - Crazy! Fuck! I know the Mighty Maples. They're good. "Devil's Farts". Crazy name. Who, or what, is "AlfaMK"? Maybe it means "alpha monkey"? Mainstream gangster rap, I bet. He won't be that cool. - Guys? - What's that? Oh, no! We're under attack from a Coke Lite ad. Do you want an autograph? No, I'm fine. Sorry. Okay, weird. I think... Have we met before? You look like my cleaner. - Bullshit! - What kind of cheap line was that? - What the fuck? - Okay... Take it easy, boss. What would you prefer? How about you just say "Hi, I'm"... Just call me alfa. Or AMK. - You probably prefer that. - I know what music you make: "Yo yo, I'm a man, Bitches this, bitches that, I got a gun made of gold, bang, bang!" The fans like it. My cleaner too. - People like any old shit if... - If what? If it's about bitches and tits. Then you'd better show a bit more of your tits. - If you want to compete. - That's gonna be your hashtag. Your friends are a bit cringey. What's your band name? - We're... - Wait, let me guess... "Vagina Woolfpack"! Sounds very feminist. Is this some kind of mental diarrhea with you or what? Virginia Woolf was an author. - I know who Virginia Woolf was. - No, he doesn't. A band name you have to explain? Awesome. Very indie. It's great. Come on, let's go. I think someone wants to be alone with their testosterone. Bye-bye, butterfly. What's up with the ho? She wanna talk, no-go Easy going all the time City kids living in distress Shiny pills janglin' in their Prada bag Diamond-studded lighter for my smokes I only sip Fanta purple, no jokes Easy going all the time Easy going all the time White Dragon Yu-Gi-Oh, All the cards are holo Easy going all the time Easy going all the time Easy going all the time What's up with the ho? She wanna talk, no-go A golden bathtub? Yeah, right. He got 10,000 clicks in four days. - I bet he paid for them! - Guys like him screw up the world. Well, your channel has a few hundred followers too. - What? - Yep. - Dude! - Awesome! Thanks. Shall we go in? - We need some roadies. - Hey, Ella... What was up with that guy earlier? - What do you mean? - Do you like him? No. Never. I only love you, bae. Okay, you fame-hungry TikTok groupies must be wild about the Energy Song Contest! Here with us are last year's winners, The Harmonics. Stop! Thank you! And we also have the Mighty Maples! And also "Easy going all the time" alfaMK. Brass by Svenja and the Svens. Pauli? And the tender she-wolves of Virginia Woolfpack! And The Devil's Farts. In the first round, votes are cast using these cards. The four bands with the most votes will go into the semi-finals. That means you get a micro-budget to shoot a music video. - A video! - The three bands with the most clicks will go into the finals. Man, what's his problem? He has an ego problem. You're about to play in front of 500 people! Tim, if I shit my pants... - Just pan away. Okay? - Sure, I'll do that. - Shiny! - Wow, crazy! - Where did you get it? - I borrowed it from the Flintbones. Don't they have a gig at a party tonight? What did you do, Ell? Did you let them use you as a human table for cash? Come on, we want to impress the people out there, right? I hope they love us. Wolf pussies, come here.... Are you hungry, wolves? Look, above us all They're shining way up high Like diamonds in the sky Diamonds in the sky Look how high they are We reach out in the night Just blinded by the light Blinded by the light Oh, how they dazzle Until they burn Whenever the light goes on Once again you're gone Lonely, lonely Lonely star! Whenever the light goes on Once again you're gone Lonely, lonely Lonely star! We're Virginia Woolfpack and that was "Lonely Star". Thank you! Girl power! Okay, easy now, guys. Okay. Those were the contestants who don't want to be lonely stars. But how long will a young woman stay lonely in the music business? Next up, alfaMK. Yolo. Or whatever you deranged social media freaks say nowadays. Here comes king monkey. A beat that comes out of a computer isn't a real beat. Mean bro, pants low, eyes lower Smoke weed, chill in the street Babe's a keeper In the black, bank account's way above Wearing Dior brother Bitch is too sticky, fuckin' love Block her call, iPhone 12, Shines like rims, black on black It's my flex, minimum I got 5 zeros on my checks My city don't give a fuck Mercedes Benz all scratched up I stir the wheel, pullin' donuts Shawty sippin' double cup The city's lit up blue I'm gonna get out of here soon 200 miles an hour Through concrete I'll flower And it's raining purple bills - It's raining purple bills... - Purple! - It's raining purple bills... - Purple! Purple, purple bills Roll a fat one Losing sight, head is sore Too much purple in my pockets Count no more Share a wad with the boys White Nikes shark toys Chillin' out round the corner What we'll do, I don't know Feelin' rough, heavy eyes Head is light now She wants kids, drop my phone Ditching that one Baby, stop the pain please Painkiller, heart's at ease Beer stops the downfall Lights out The city's lit up blue I'm gonna get out of here soon - 84 BPM - 84 BPM - Till everyone knows my name - Till everyone knows my name And it's raining purple bills - Purple! - It's raining purple bills It's raining purple bills Purple, purple bills Damn! The lyrics are like mega-puke. But the hook is mega unpuke! That was "Easy going all the time" alfaMK. Thank you. Now let's make some noise for Pauli! How can a monkeybrain like him write such an awesome hook? Are you okay? - I'll be right back. - Hey! Let's go! Another drink? Hey. My Gibson looks good on you. - That was... - Really awesome? That was my voice. I bought it. Did you forget? Now people think they were your lyrics. I didn't act like we didn't know each other. Hey, Leon! We want another round. You coming? Yep! I think I'm much wanted there. And vote for us, huh? Ella Vagina... Virginia... You look good tonight. Do you think we got through? Await the verdict of the universe, bae. The crowd went wild for that dumb alfa guy. Fuck, man! - We did, too. - Ella really wants us to win. - We'll get into the next round. - I hope so. Hey, they've counted the votes. So, the results are in. These acts are through to the next round: - AlfaMK! - Fuck you, universe! And also... The Devil's Farts. Okay, people, we get it! Joining them are... Virginia Woolfpack! - Ella? - Pack booze-up! Hey, we can squeeze you in somehow. It's okay, I'm fine. I have my bike. A shift at Pizza Tower after winning? - We have to celebrate! - Yo, Pizza Tower. - Is that where your after-show party is? - Yeah. - Now leave Ella alone. - I'm just being nice. Be nice somewhere else. Okay. I have to run, okay? Bye-bye, butterfly. "Bye-bye, butterfly"? What's that supposed to mean? Hey, that guy... - The monkey? - Yes. Guys like him can't always win! And saying to Ella, "Hey, you look like my cleaner". - That's really not okay. - What will we do in round two? - Beat the monkey! - Yeah, man! Work's over now. Okay. Somehow it's not the same without Ella. Yeah, that's true. Yeah. Welcome to Pizza Tower, home of amazing pizzas. What can I... ...do for you? Nice outfit. Where are your groupies? - Or did you buy them too? - Ouch! Welcome to Pizza Tower, home of amazing pizzas. What... - You can't just use my hook! - Take it as a compliment. I see it as... Lemonade? Or mango? ...fraud. Mango-fraud? Okay, truce. They went wild for our song! It's not "our" song. I brought this champagne that you like so much. Na-na gold Gold in my glass, in my veins Gold around my neck Golden your cage They're not bad lyrics. Hold on... I think you're smiling. - Was that all? - Yes. Cool. That will be 14.95, please. I got that today. It's from a label. They want to meet us. - Did you tell them it was my... - No, I didn't say anything. They just asked about the singer in the chorus. I mean, I could go there by myself. Go ahead. Okay. Let's do one more song, okay? What if I don't like your beats? And besides... I already have a band. - Three parmas and a calzone? - Yes. Thursday, 5 p.m. - Since when do you sell champagne? - What's that doing there? - Uh... - And here: Three parmas, one calzone. What's wrong with you, girl? Hurry, hurry! She's coming! One Ella pizza with Ella tomatoes! - Jesus! - Pack hug! It's not the same without you. That Pauli guy... Wow! He was really dope. Close your eyes, free fallin' Since when do you write lyrics? Cool! - It's beautiful. - Keep playing. Close your eyes, free fallin' We'll never be that young again Let's believe, maybe fail Get up find our way Glowing smokes, gasoline The cheapest wine and aspirin With the wolves in the streets We sing and howl to the wind You got a hook for it? "I'll make my mistakes". I'll make my mistakes I'll make my mistakes I'll make my mistakes in just the right way I'll make my mistakes I'll make my mistakes Maybe they will be mistakes But they belong to me I say Risk a kiss with broken glass I promise you the pain will pass I'll make my mistakes I'll make my mistakes I'll make my mistakes in just the right way I'll make my mistakes I'll make my mistakes Hey, Ella... That's a fucking hit! I'm gonna write down the adlibs! I wish I could freeze this moment here with you now. I'm gonna miss you guys after graduation. Miss us? Why? Wolves stay together for life. Well... Romy will probably end up in jail someday for getting drunk and getting in a bar fight. - True. - Right? But seriously... We could really make it. Us and the music. Really! After graduation, we'll just focus on the band. - What? - I dunno... Tell her. What? I have an apprenticeship. I'm going away after graduation. To Hamburg. Yeah, and I'm going with her. Of course. And if they... How will we do the band when you're in Hamburg? You'll do something after graduation too. I dunno... I thought I'd be making music with you guys. Are you serious? Okay, what if we win this song contest? We'll have shown people music that sounds great. Especially Alfa Monkey. But that's not the only reason we participate! And to have a good time together. As long as we're still together. - Hamburg, yeah? - We'll just Facetime super often. - Great. - Wolf video chat. We will always be us. Huh? What do you mean? Otherwise, we wouldn't be us. Awesome. We're gonna stick together? Promise? What a shitty atmosphere. We won today! Pack hug. Look! It's the same color as Anaïs' bag. And this one's her hair color. So where'd you really get that bad-ass guitar? None of your business. - Yeah... - What? The neon look is really in right now. Like that girl with the green hair from the talent show. No, no, you come right here! - Hi, Andrea! - Hi. We'll let them dry outside today, okay? - Your nails look great. - Yeah? Well, I hope Kai likes them too. You're not doing it for Kai, but for you! Can you explain why your brother came home with a 1,900 euro guitar? How do you know how much it's worth? Because the von Bergen boy has one of those things too. A guitar isn't just a "thing"! Is it Leon's? - Fuck! - Yes, fuck! What if I lose my job? He gave it to me, that's all. Bullshit! - Mom, I didn't... - We don't have much. But that doesn't make it okay to steal things. I bought it off him. With what? - With my music! - Sure. Yeah, if you bothered to listen, with a hook. I sung it. - A chorus. - Anyway. You're going to take the guitar back. And the music is on hold until after your exams. I'm going to screw up my exams anyway. Thank you! Ella! You can all fuck yourselves! You're a bird and you love to fly I am the sea and love the deep You can't land on me If you do you'll crumble You'll never be able to unfold your wings I never get higher than a few feet The horizon just reflects back to me Thin layers before we touch Can you feel me already? You're up there, and below you I lie You'll learn to swim and I'll learn to fly Ella! Where are you? No, man. I... I thought you were upset about the Hamburg thing. What about our music video? What? Yes, I'll tell them. - She's not coming. - What? She never doesn't come. Unless she's at Pizza Tower. She said your mom's against it. Because of the exams. You could have called first. But anyway... I'm ready. - What? - I just wanted to bring back the guitar. - You don't have to. - Yes. I do. But what if you get to the finals? My friends don't seem to care if we win or not anyway. So... I could just store it here for you. Come for a ride? - What? - Well, I mean... Your day can't get any worse, right? I just need to make a call. - Where to? - It's top secret. I have what you need Just tell me when and where Your eyes, airplane windows You need a few fast nights Get something outta your head Inception Battery's always full, I'm charged I'm your Beastie Boy, I'm your Marten Fight for your right to party Come with my Seven Nation Army I have what you need Just tell me when and where Love, peace and happiness Love, peace and happiness So what are we doing here? Checking out the big stage for the finals. - Really? - Yep! This is Tom. - Tom and I both went to... - Boarding school. Yeah, of course. - Let's go! - Yeah. - Close your eyes. - People only ever say that in the movies. - It's super creepy in real life. - Come on! Okay, let's go. And now imagine... You walk onto the stage. Your pulse is 180. There are 20,000 people out there. And then... Our music! The city's lit up blue I'm gonna get out of here soon 84 BPM Till everyone knows my name Life ain't fair, it's true Low tide for me, and high for you 200 miles an hour Through concrete I'll flower The city's lit up blue I'm gonna get out of here soon 200 miles an hour Through concrete I'll flower And the city's lit up blue I'm gonna get out of here soon 84 BPM Till everyone knows my name And it's raining purple bills And it's raining purple bills And it's raining purple bills Purple, purple bills So, what do you think? Is this your X-Factor number? "I'll make you a star..." We all need someone to believe in us. Even if they're a talent show jury. Listen... - This is important to me. - What? You're not doing this just because you're into me, are you? I can't guarantee that. I'm serious. Do you believe in me, or not? I can tell you this: It'd be good if I wasn't into you. Because then we could do music without it being awkward. Great! Let's just do one song together. What exactly do you want? Do you want to flirt, or make music? I can't figure you out. How much clearer do I have to make it? Oh, like the prince and the maid? Like in the fairy tale? And your heart will break if I don't put on the dumb shoe? Maybe. I can't, I'm sorry. I think I have forgotten who I am My ship is sailing With the last puff of wind Castaway, all my crew's overboard Ocean eyes, I'm slowly getting lost You're standing at shore Throw out a rope Pulling me out Letting me fall? Oh, we're both so very damn different I'm north, you're south Hot chocolate? I only mean well. You have a chance to graduate. I just don't want you to ruin it. Moisten it first, then it holds better. - It smells like grass. - We're making hash cocoa! Doctor's orders. It relaxes the muscles. Relaxes the muscles? I don't feel a thing. I usually hate it when Mom drags me to some miracle healer. - But this time it was worth it. - Want some? No. Hey! Come here. We love you, okay? We're going to Hamburg, but we still love the band. Here comes the master plan: We'll shoot an awesome video. And we 'll have a study group for our exams every day. - And get Mom to finally chill out. - Yeah, man! Yeah, man? Come on! What if I prove to you that we can make it as a band? - Like, for real. - Oh, Ell! I got a business card. - From a label. - You don't have to prove anything. It's Ella here. Mr. Jung? The one from the song contest. So could I... I mean could we come by earlier? Tomorrow? Okay. So how was it again? You're not Virginia? No, no. We're all the Woolfpack, you know? Virginia Woolf? What about alfaMK? He's sick. Probably food poisoning or something. I have to answer this, okay? - You guys want a matcha latte? - Sure, thanks. Seriously? You're stoned right now? Yesterday I hardly noticed anything. But now... Guys... Close your eyes, free fallin' We'll never be that young again Let's believe, maybe fail Get up, find our way Glowing smokes, gasoline The cheapest wine and aspirin Romy! With the wolves in the streets We sing and howl to the wind - Romy? - Yeah? I'll make my mistakes I'll make my mistakes Maybe they will be mistakes... Thanks. Wow, I was really feeling it. Okay... Interesting. Interesting. We just wrote the song. We haven't rehearsed it yet. - Fresh? - Yeah. I've got a few ideas about you. Girl bands are cool. If you were to go in the direction of Ariana Grande meets Kanye... But we're a rock band! You need that edge, yeah? But more accessible. More mainstream, right? Okay, so... Mainstream, edgy... - And accessible? - Yes. - Okay. - So where do we start? For example, your name... - Virginia Woolf is a writer who... - Yeah. That's cool. Have you guys considered something more down-to-earth? All your last names in a row? Or half your first names jumbled together? Ca-Ro... Ana-El. Caroanael. Caro-anal! Yeah, something like that. Look: They're some of our recent successes. - Notice anything? - I know her from Insta! It's like this: Everybody likes different things these days. And everybody listens to everything. That's why we like to work with talents who bring their own fan-base. So you mean... To become successful, you already have to be successful? Yes, you could put it that way. If I were you I'd stick to alfaMK, kid. What? AlfaMK? - Should we sing about love or something? - Yeah! Exactly! For example that feeling when you think of some cute guy. This is alfaMK. He's got 100,000 followers. I can work with that. His lyrics are totally sexist. That's not such a bad thing. Listen... 100,000 followers. Your hook's great here. It's really good. That's your voice? You wrote that guy's hook? Why is Ella's voice in the monkey's music? Mr. von Bergen is here. Oh, really? He doesn't look very sick. He sounded fine on the phone earlier on. - You betrayed the pack! - I feel queasy. I can explain it all! Charlie! Come on, I'll take you to the bathroom. I'll come with you. - Me too. - Wait, Anaïs! You can contact me when you're out of kindergarten. Fuck. Please just go. Would you like an aspirin? I'm sorry. - But... - But what? Did you lie to us or not? Did you cheat on us with him? Did you hear how he talks to us? Or to you? - It's complicated. - My ass! I thought we stuck together? You're going to Hamburg and didn't tell me. We wanted to tell you after graduation so you don't screw it up. It was obvious we'd move on after graduating. You can't force your dreams on everyone else. Have you noticed it's always about you? - Anaïs... - Ella, just go away, okay? I mean it. Hey, no studying at work. - Half your time is up. - Fuck. Ell, you have to do something. You're out of the band! You're not happy, the wolves aren't happy... The wolves hate me. And I can understand why. I know it's totally dumb, but... While we were shooting, my headphones... They're busted. And I actually have to edit the music video... - What video? - The Woolfpack video for the contest. - We shot it yesterday without you. - Okay, I'm going. No... I could just use your headphones. I thought they were feminists. I wonder if the fans will accept our new look. We said we'd try the Ariana Grande-meets-Kanye thing. - It's... new. - Oh, fuck! You guys wanted it edgy and mainstream, right? - As long as we beat the monkey... - Yeah. Well, how did YouTube get you hooked this time? We're watching porn. Okay, carry on. Will you give our video a like? For the song contest? Do I look as if I like anything? Okay, enough. - Ella? - Just leave me alone. I need your help. - Another doctor's appointment? - No. But you need to start tidying up. And I think it'd be a good idea to start with the von Bergens. I've been there twice now. Leon's sitting around all day strumming on that expensive guitar... - Really? - Yeah. - He told me it was true. - What? That he sold you the guitar. I'm really sorry. So, are you coming? Okay, fine. I'll do the floors. Hi. I'm sorry. Oh, just go ahead. Are you done already? Yes. Hi. - What do you want? - My guitar. Come back in two days, okay? That's not how it works. It's my guitar. I'm not gonna bring it to you. You know, that riff... You could... I'd try going up after the third chord. Try it early. Yeah, maybe. It was a real shitty stunt I pulled with the label. I'm sorry. Yeah... Yeah, a really shitty stunt. But... Have fun with it. You know... I'm just so scared that it's not enough. That I'm not good enough. At school, in music... I don't just want to be your fucking cleaner in this song contest. I think Anaïs was right. As soon as you want more, you become an asshole. Your feminist friend, right? Honestly, what's with the macho act you put on all the time? Macho act? Wearing Dior brother Bitch is too sticky, fuckin' love Fuckin' love? It's... style. - It doesn't mean anything. - It does! It means something to Anaïs. It means something to me. Respect. You can't just show up with a bottle of champagne because you think you can. You might as well start working at your parents' consulting firm. Ouch. I need your help. Okay. Me and the wolves always did everything together. Since first grade. They're like family to me. There's no one worse at family than me. Let's do a song together. For the wolves, you know? Okay. - I was thinking E minor. - Or G minor. - Where are we now? - "Our time". "Our time". Okay. The birthday. I remember that. Look, that's Romy. That's me. I think Romy just turned ten. It was a great time. - That has to be in the lyrics. - Yeah. Just four days till we meet again. - Verse one and two? - No, the second verse is fine. That's good too. "What just happened"? - No, that's bad. - No way! "Whenever I close my eyes". Whenever I close my eyes This is worse than my divorce. Oh, fuck! Yes. Oh, god! We made fools of ourselves. The worst thing is, that asshole producer's formula still works. Caroanael got more clicks than "We will always be us". - Can I show you something? - No. It's better with headphones anyway, but... Or I'll just plug it into the PA. It's a song. You have to listen to it. Really. You know... Maybe it's like in physics, with amplitudes. - One song evens out the other. - It's not that simple. - It'll only take three minutes. - It's not about you working with ALFA. I thought we talked about everything. - We do. - I can't believe you lied to me. Wait! WHO WILL REACH THE FINAL? AlfaMK - THE CITY'S LIT UP BLUE My vision for the video was actually gonna be... like a car chase dance sequence. And you'd all be wearing white dresses and have creepy flower wreaths in your hair. Like in "Midsommar"? Hi. Leon, this is Tim. Take a seat. Okay. Congratulations. - Thanks. - The Wolves are in the finals too. - Yeah, I heard. - Tim? You wanted to help Mom with her nails, right? No. Why would I do that? Ah, doing her nails! Yes, sure. Sorry. - Ciao. - Ciao. The wolves wouldn't listen to the track. How can I apologize if they won't let me? Maybe you have to perform the song in a place where they least expect it. Okay. - Where? - We'll play the song at the final. "Through concrete I'll flower". I didn't know you meant the concrete of community housing. So, who's got the best song? We'll find out in the Energy Song Contest finals. First up: The Devil's Farts. It's great, huh? - Is that him? - Yes. Hey, Tom? Can you get Virginia Woolfpack from backstage? - Sure, no problem. - Okay. You're on after the Devils. Now it's getting serious. Mr. Boeblinger-Moll? - You're here? - You're not even 16. What've you got there? Who'd have thought alcopops would make a comeback? Makes you feel old, huh? Events like this. Interesting, Mrs... Heike. Ah, you're Ella's mom? You know, I used to play in a band too. - You? - Yeah. But our smooth-acid skiffle jazz never really caught on. I like TLC. Ah, TLC? The '90s. Shall we go in? - Yes. - Yeah? - Anaïs! - The big stage at all costs, right? Hey, are you the new alfaMK? Yeah. "Featuring Ella". Okay, if you keep changing your name, could you let us know a bit earlier? The next act is alfaMK featuring Ella! Make some noise! Guys, please listen to the track. Okay? It's for you. I want us back The way we were together With sparkling eyes Building castles in the air A whole summer long With bloodied knees Chasing our dreams Back then it was all so easy But now we're like strangers With 1000 problems And it pisses me off And I'm truly sorry Why did I wreck Something so beautiful? Whenever I close my eyes It's all I can see I know I don't always show you That you're precious to me Whenever I close my eyes I see how it was Even singing our last song We will always be us Remember when in between the lines We built our dreams A tent was our home at night What's left of it? Of our time? I swear I'll quit lying Remember when our hearts were light We have to part now And I'm gonna miss y'all And it pisses me off And I'm truly sorry Why did I wreck Something so beautiful? Whenever I close my eyes It's all I can see I know I don't always show you That you're precious to me Whenever I close my eyes I see how it was Even singing our last song We will always be us What happened to our love? It used to always be just us I just don't want to lose us Whenever I close my eyes It's all I can see I know I don't always show you That you're precious to me Whenever I close my eyes I see how it was Even singing our last song We will always be us These little rascals just kill me! Now let's give a big hand to: Featuring Ella! - How about it, Wolves? - Ella! Here! - Your guitar. - Thanks. Close your eyes, free fallin' We'll never be that young again Let's believe, maybe fail Get up, find our way Glowing smokes, gasoline The cheapest wine and aspirin With the wolves in the streets We sing and howl to the wind I'll make my mistakes I'll make my mistakes I'll make my mistakes in just the right way I'll make my mistakes I'll make my mistakes Maybe they will be mistakes But they belong to me I say Risk a kiss with broken glass I promise you the pain will pass I'll make my mistakes I'll make my mistakes I'll make my mistakes in just the right way I'll make my mistakes I'll make my mistakes Joyfully diving into the storm We scream ourselves hoarse Live till we burn Let's cry till we laugh Piss everyone off The sun and us at our zenith One day nostalgia it'll be Swinging the world by the tail Try to stop us, you'll fail! I'll make my mistakes I'll make my mistakes I'll make my mistakes in just the right way I'll make my mistakes I'll make my mistakes Maybe they will be mistakes But they belong to me I say Risk a kiss with broken glass I promise you the pain will pass I'll make my mistakes I'll make my mistakes I'll make my mistakes in just the right way I'll make my mistakes I'll make my mistakes Cahide was right. This moment right now can't be frozen in time. You can only live it once. And that's right now. We didn't win the contest. But we had the best summer of our lives. - Congratulations. Well done. - Thank you. Not me! Film Ella! Hey! You know that we share everything in the pack, right? Everything, if you know what I mean. - So who won? - The Devil's Farts!
