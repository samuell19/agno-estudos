(mysterious music) (dramatic music) - [Announcer] Allied Strategic Command Center press release dated July 21st, 2036. As the war, now in its 6th year, has recently spread beyond earth to the strategically vital industrial space colonies and the combined casualty count, both military and civilian, is now estimated in the tens of millions, the Joint Forces Council has approved a new unorthodox method of warfare in the hope of bringing a swift military resolution to the current stalemate. (ship rumbling) - [Man On Loudspeaker] Execution of Private Gomez in cell 105 now initiating due process. - No! If you have to execute me, do it on earth! - [Guard] Are you gonna cry? - One last time, please? - [Guard] Secure him. - [Gomez] You can't torture me like an animal! I have basic rights! - Execution of Private Gomez will commence in one minute. Execution of Captain Alrich in Cell 106 to follow. - [Gomez] Let me see my family one last time! - [Guard] Shut up. (punching) - [Man On Loudspeaker] Private Gomez to the chamber. Sergeant Flowers report to Cell Block A. (thudding) - [Guard] Keep warm and toasty. - [Man On Loudspeaker] Private Gomez, under the Allied Strategic Command code of military justice, Section 32, Article 13, you have been tried and found guilty by a military court of your superiors for the charge of murder in the first degree. The sentence is death. (gas hissing) - No! - [Man On Loudspeaker] Execution chamber activated. Incineration has begun. (coughing) Heat is in excess of 100 degrees, 300 degrees, 500 degrees. Incineration complete, remove the remains. - [Guard] Geez, the smell. Just get his dog tags. (jingling) - [Guard] Got 'em. (door clanging) - [Man On Loudspeaker] Initiate due process. Execution of prisoner in Cell 106, Captain Aldrich. - [Guard] Alright, Aldrich, you're up. Quit struggling, burner, move it, dirtball! - [Man On Loudspeaker] Execution of Captain Aldrich will commence in one minute. Execution of Corporal Kovich to follow. - [Guard] No smoking in the execution chamber, Aldrich. - You're worried about my health? - [Guard] Put it out. Hand over your stash for redistribution. - One last drag. - [Guard] Look out! (sizzling) (yelling) (thudding) - [Man On Loudspeaker] Security alert! All levels, security alert! Attempted escape in execution chamber! - [Guard] Heading there now! (thudding) - [Man On Loudspeaker] All guards report to level four! - [Prisoner] Hey, let us out of here! Let me out, man! (punching) (loudspeaker chattering) Let us out, let us out! - [Guard] He's not in Sector 7. - [Guard] Check the infirmary. - [Guard] Roger! - [Man On Loudspeaker] Level 4 security, all guards report to your station. - [Door] Access denied. - [Man] Who's this guy? - [Woman] Is that a gun or are you just happy to see me? - [Man] Isn't that the guy from Fobos? (all laughing) - Not too shabby, Captain Aldrich. Glad to see you still have the killer instinct. - [Aldrich] Flemming. (tense music) - [Guard] Prisoners, ten hut! - I suppose you're wondering why the man who sent me here has come to see me? (gun clicking) Good! I figured you still had it. Had to test it. Two years of hard time can break any man's spirit. (yelling) (punching) - [Prisoner] Ain't she the feisty one? - [Prisoner] Sinners. - [Guard] Silence! - Captain Aldrich, first in his class at the Point. Youngest officer to receive the Congressional Medal of Valor. Led some of the most daring missions of the war. Was one of my most promising young officers until the Fobos raid when he decided to abort a mission and pull his men back. I had no choice but to court martial him for desertion. An offense under battle conditions, that's an automatic death sentence. What a waste of military talent. Aldrich, you've had the pleasure of being hit by Major Agatha Doyle. - Agatha. I'll remember the name. And I'll remember your blue eyes. - Fall in! I said, fall in! - Sure thing, Agatha. - The name's Major Doyle. Major will do, Captain. You will each address the Colonel or myself by rank or you will be severely disciplined. - Alright, that concludes the little lesson in military etiquette. Now, let's get to the business at hand. I've been asked to get a special unit together to go on a very dangerous mission behind enemy lines. The chances of you surviving are not good. If they were I wouldn't be here talking to you ladies and gentlemen. (laughs) - Something funny, Private? - Nothing, sir, ma'am. I mean, Major. It's just I've never been called a gentlemen before. (prisoners laughing) - [Guard] Quiet! - You're not gonna hit me, too, are you sir? Ma'am, Major. - You're all scum, throwaway scum. That's why they've chosen you to volunteer for this mission. Now, you'll all be wearing black boxes, data recorders that will tape your combat performance for our mission evaluation. If you perform well you'll get an honorable discharge. Now, if I were you, I would take that deal. Any of you who don't want it step forward and you'll be taken back to your cell and your sentence will be carried out. Good, very good. Now, let's all get acquainted. Private Poe, Shock Troops. Wiped out an entire lunar village killing 37 people. Then he killed his commanding officer with his bare hands. The Army says he's a homicidal maniac. I say he's a good soldier. - What are you looking at, Private? - I believe he's looking at your throat, Major. - [Guard] Face front, soldier! - Corporal Karlson, Mechanized Infantry Engineer. Sold top secret engine plans to the enemy for cold cash. Nothing ideological about Karlson, right? - What's good for me is right. What's bad for me is wrong. You keep out of the death chamber, I'll give you anything you want. Anything. - [Prisoner] I'll take some of that. - Can you fix an ion plasma generator? - I like getting dirty, Major. I can get any motor humming and stroking. - Private First Class Siegal. Computer expert. Hacked his way into the military mainframe and sabotaged the personnel program. - With all due respect, I (chuckles), I didn't sabotage anything. I was merely trying to rig my discharge papers. I was wrongly accused. - Same here, sir. Wrongly accused, but I am a soldier and proud of it, sir. - Corporal Ryan. No commando background, but extensive demolition experience. - What did he do, sir? - He blew up his commanding officer. (prisoners laughing) - I told my CO to cut the red wire, sir. How could I know he was color blind? (prisoners laughing) - [Guard] Shut up, Private! - Color blind, that's good. That's really good. - It's the truth! Sir, I'm not like these people. I'm a good soldier. I like the Army. My CO's death was an accident. - Lying is a sin, Brother Ryan. - Jones, Field M.D. Served in a POW enemy hospital. Did unnecessary surgery on enemy soldiers with lethal results, eight died. - I am a soldier of God. I just acted on command. The Angel of Death is my superior officer. I can't really abide by anyone else's orders. But you look like a God-fearing woman to me, Major. I will be proud to do battle alongside you. - Major, a word. I told you you'd be leading scum to battle, in this case, deranged scum. She's a great field doctor. Look, this is your last chance. I don't wanna tell you what to do. - My father used to say, once you make a decision, never second guess yourself. - I can count on you? - You can count on me, sir. - Good, let's continue. Cargo Pilot Koosman. Attempted to steal a space shuttle and go AWOL. - Should have given me that weekend pass when I asked for it. (prisoners laughing) - Corporal Goodis. Special Forces operative. Background in acrobatics and covert motion. Tragically, Goodis was raped by four soldiers. She hunted them down and killed them. The Army found her guilty. I wouldn't have. She hasn't talked since, probably traumatized, but she's still an effective soldier. Private Cutter. Raped and mutilated two fellow soldiers under the influence of intravenous drugs. - I'm the original party animal. - When he's clean he's a fearless point man and fear is the primary enemy in this mission. Anybody who's not afraid is somebody we need. - Try me, you'll like it. - [Flemming] You have 72 hours to prepare. After several dry runs on a full scale model you will board a tactical shuttle that will transport you from our command ship to the enemy base where you will proceed with your mission. After that you're on your own. Good luck. - This is our target, an enemy fuel processing plant. It is the key to their current ability to launch long range missiles and bomb cities back on Earth. Some of you may have relatives in those cities. - Question is, would you buy a used space shuttle from Professor Doyle? - We take this plant and we change the course of the war. Shorten it, maybe even save lives. - Sure it will. - You got a problem, soldier? You say the word and you're back in your cell. And Koosman, you'd better be as good a pilot as you're cracked up to be. Because we have to do a hard gravity landing in the middle of a sandstorm. On impact, Poe and Cutter will go out first and establish a fire base. - When do we get weapons? - Yeah, when do we get the weapons? - You get weapons when you're ready to get weapons. - [Yastremski] She won't make it! - [Doyle] That's when I say you're ready to get weapons. - Look, these animals are going to eat her alive, even before she gets-- - I don't think so. She's a good officer. I feel kind of bad for her, though, her father was a good friend of mine and a great soldier. She tries hard to measure up. - She seems like she's on the verge of quitting. - She can't. Not since Rigel. She's been thanking me ever since I got her this assignment. This is her last chance. She won't let me down. Raise the audio. - So stay hydrated, people! Next, we move through these corridors. Expect strong opposition here and here. - Excuse me. - Yes, what? - I appreciate the strategic importance of this mission and the wonders it will do for your military career, but it would be nice if at least a couple of us come back alive. What about creating a diversion? - Aldrich, this is General Flemming's plan. I am executing orders as they were handed down to me. General Flemming is one of the greatest experts on commando warfare. - I've served under Flemming. - Shut up, Aldrich! You know, for a gutless disgrace, you have way too many opinions. (clearing throat) - I believe Aldrich was not questioning the General's thoughts or motives, or strength. I think, basically, if you would refer to Sun Tzu's, The Art of War, you might find-- - I don't have to do anything. All I have to do is give you a choice, one last time. Pull out of the mission or shut your mouth! Am I clear? And you. I don't wanna hear another word out of you. - Sure thing, Agatha. - I guess you commit one cowardly, despicable act like desertion, it's really difficult for you to conduct yourself like an officer. You want me to treat you like a new recruit? You want me to humiliate you? Fine, drop and give me a hundred. - You're going about this all wrong. - 200! - I heard the stories about Rigel. Now I know how it happened. You aren't worthy of leading troops into battle if you don't give a damn about their lives. - 200 or the chamber. - It'd be a lot easier to hate your guts if you weren't so pretty. - 300, and you, computer expert, count for him! - I, I can do that. Go ahead. One, two, three, four, five, six. - [Woman] Five, four, three, two, one. - [Controller] Assault shuttle Manta Ray is clear. - [Doyle] The assault shuttle Manta Ray. We've cleared the command ship and are on our way out. Koosman, can't you steady the ship? - [Koosman] Stabilizer's are activated. This is as smooth as it gets, get used to it. We've got a long ride ahead of us. - You okay? - (groaning) Yeah. No, not really. I don't have much combat experience. - Kind of afraid, aren't you? - Yeah. How about you? - Sure, it's natural. I don't fight nature. Want me to hold your hand? I know it's gonna make me feel better. (tense music) - Aldrich, I wanted to ask you this. I was just wondering, what happened up at Rigel? I mean, you know, you're an officer, you must know the truth. - Doyle was attack battalion leader. Some general gave some crazed order to hit an enemy stronghold. Order was verbal, no written order ever got there. She was so anxious to execute the order that she lost almost every man and woman in the battalion. General later said that the order had been misunderstood. - [Siegal] Oh, man, what am I doing on this mission? - 14 minutes to touchdown. Entering enemy air space, radio silence. Listen up, activate your black boxes. - Commencing hard gravity landing. We're losing altitude fast, 200 meters. - [Doyle] As soon as we land put on your pressure suits. - 150 meters, 100, 60, 50, 40. (crashing) - Team, fall in, go formation now! - [Soldier] Go, go, go, go! Move, move, move, move! - [Doyle] I want two assault teams. Team Alpha take south entrance. Team Baker, southeast. Ryan, set decoding and charges to go in tri-phasic shield near the east security hatch. Siegal, use your view to override security. Poe, cover Ryan. Cutter, stay sharp for snipers. - [Ryan] Charges set! - [Doyle] Go! (exploding) Once we're in, reseal both air locks immediately. Restore pressure. - [Koosman] Secure! - [Poe] Secure! (door hissing) - [Doyle] We're proceeding through the processing plant. We're at the southeast entrance heading west. - [Aldrich] Roger, that. Team Alpha's heading to the generator room. - [Doyle] We'll check the command center. I want Siegal operating their CPU so we can monitor all communications. - [Aldrich] Check. - [Doyle] Keep in contact. - [Aldrich] Sure thing. - [Doyle] I want regular reports. - [Aldrich] Check the door, Poe. Watch our rear, I don't want any surprises coming up behind us. - [Karlson] So far there's nothing. - [Doyle] Maintain your space and don't bunch up, but keep your partner covered. - [Aldrich] Check your targets. I don't want anyone getting hit by friendly fire. - [Doyle] Poe, move forward! - [Koosman] Something's wrong. - [Aldrich] Don't let it get to you, stay calm. - [Poe] Ain't nothing that can kill you if you kill it first. - [Cutter] Roger that. - [Koosman] This isn't right. Where are the workers, the guards, anybody? - [Doyle] Stay focused, Koosman! - [Koosman] The asimonium pumps in Sector 1 cleared. Checking Sector 2. - [Aldrich] Clearing Sector 5, moving to north terminal. - [Doyle] Koosman, take point. Goodis, cover us. (ominous music) (grunting) (gun firing) - Take cover! (bullets ricocheting) (tense music) - What's she saying? - It's rigged, nobody's here. - [Poe] It's just a booby trap. - [Doyle] Aldrich, area's clear. - Thanks, I almost bought it. If you don't mind, if it doesn't make you uncomfortable, I'm gonna stick real close to you. - Hey, easy, it's us. What was the gunfire? - Booby trap. - [Karlson] Where the hell's the enemy? - Siegal, get the lights. - [Jones] Major, you're hit. Here, let me see your arm. - [Siegal] The computer set up's an old model. It's from before the 21st century, but it shouldn't take me too long. - [Koosman] What I wanna know is where is everyone? - [Aldrich] Well, they know we're here by now. - [Doyle] Siegal, how much longer? - [Siegal] I've almost got it, just a few more seconds. - [Jones] You're lucky it's just a flesh wound. The bullet skimmed the surface. - Major, if we take out the lights we're gonna lose the power generator. - Karlson can restart the generator, right Corporal? - Yes, Major. - Siegal, do it! - Okay. (clanging) - We split up here. Cutter, Aldrich, take this section. - [Aldrich] Roger that. - Jones, Koosman, Goodis, Section 2. - [Koosman] Got it. - Karlson, Ryan, Poe, the generator room. Move, move! - [Ryan] Proceeding to the generator room. So far, no contact. - [Doyle] Continue with extreme caution. - [Aldrich] And check for trip wires and motion triggers. - This place is weird. Where is everybody? (dramatic music) What is it? What do you see? - I don't like this, man. I don't like this. It's just us and our damn selves here! - Shh! (banging) (computers beeping) - Siegal, you guard the door while I secure the room. - [Aldrich] Aldrich reporting in, no sign of enemy forces. Sweep of Section 1 is complete. - [Siegal] What's going on, why can't we find an enemy? (gun firing) - Where are you? You scumbags! - [Doyle] What's all that gun fire? Report, report! - False alarm. - [Koosman] False alarm, were clear. - [Doyle] Let's be careful out there. Check your targets, watch for booby traps. - It's a mirror, seven years bad luck. - I wouldn't joke about those things, especially here. (panting) I can feel him. - You can feel who? - The Angel of Death, my commanding officer. (chuckles) - I don't understand. Satellite recon reported two platoons guarding this base, but where are they? Siegal, come check all the computer systems. - [Siegal] Huh, interesting, these are Halifax 232's, old systems. Give me a minute to get them online. You know, the longer this war goes on the more of this old stuff shows up. - Motion detectors? - Running. That's strange. It shows that we're the only life forms here. It's only picking up our team. - Doyle to all units. The command center is ours. Karlson, Ryan, Poe, head to the generator room and get the lights on. - Read you loud and clear. Poe, get the door. - Ready? One and two! - What are we looking for? - The ion plasma generator, to the left. It's all clear. Let's get to work. - Damn, it's hot in here! Oh, man. - Do you really know how to fix all this stuff? - Yeah, but I appreciate a strong hand in the right place. - Anything you want, baby. - [Ryan] You must be smart if you can fix these things. I just know how to blow 'em up. - [Poe] I bet Karlson knows how to blow. - [Ryan] Why don't you shut up and let her work? - [Poe] I'd like to let her work on me. - [Doyle] Talk to me, Siegal. Anything? - No, wait, hold on a second. Section 2 west, we have life. - Doyle to all units. Meet me at Section 2 west, on the double. Let's go. Aldrich, meet me near the walkway. Cutter, join up with Koosman by the eastern stairway. - This is better. Finally, let's kick some ass. - Keep your eye on that motion detector, Siegal. It doesn't move like anything human. - Maybe it isn't. - What the hell is that supposed to mean? - Whatever problems you and I have I'm not dealing with now. You run the show, I'm your number two. Our job is to survive. - Our job is to win. (grunting) - Come on! - You ready? - [Doyle] Keep your partner covered. By the book SOP leapfrogging. Use short, controlled bursts. (tense music) - [Computer] Coding pass? - [Koosman] Okay, it's open. I'll cover, go! - [Karlson] Oh, what's that smell? - [Jones] It's the angel. - Clear! - [Karlson] I don't know what's worse, the stench or the heat! - Clear! - That ain't no angel, that's rotting flesh. - What a stench. Oh, God, oh, Christ almighty! These guys are wearing U.S. Army issue. - [Ryan] Nothing but bodies! - [Cutter] Corpses. - [Koosman] Soldiers. - [Jones] Sinners. - [Ryan] U.S. soldiers. - [Koosman] Man, I did not sign up for this. - [Jones] Looks like we have an officer who's been busy. - Was there a prior attempt to take this post? - I don't know. - Where are the people who did this? How come there's no one here? - There are no bullet holes in them. - Siegal, check your instruments again. Is there any other life form on this base? - [Cutter] Something's not right about this. - [Koosman] I've never seen anything like it. - No, there's nothing, just us. - This doesn't make any sense! - [Ryan] If it wasn't so hot in here it might not be so bad. - [Koosman] Oh, God. - [Ryan] Oh, great. - [Koosman] Oh, my God. - [Karlson] I think I'm gonna throw up. How can you stand the smell? - [Koosman] Oh, God, I'm really not hungry. - That's what we picked up on the life detector. Maggots! - Damn. - Multiple injuries. Also, these men did not die together. There's various states of rigor mortis in evidence. Someone killed them one by one and piled them neatly here. - Well, that's it, we did our part. Mission's over, right Major? We took the base, that was our orders. We're done, let's go. - No, we're not! Not yet. - [Cutter] To hell with the mission! - What aren't you telling us? - [Jones] I can feel him, he is here. - Whoever did this likes to kill. - [Koosman] This mission's a bust. - [Jones] We must all pray. We must all get on our knees and ask for forgiveness. - [Karlson] Spare us the sermon, Saint Jones! - [Cutter] Freakin' fanatic. - Ryan, Karlson, get to the generator room and get the lights on, ASAP! - Yes, Major! - Yes, ma'am! - Jones. Jones! You and Cutter find some blankets and cover these men. Move it! - [Jones] Yes, ma'am. - [Doyle] Doyle, to home base. Doyle, to home base. Will you come in? - Home base here. Are you in the clear? Over. - Yes, we've secured the base, sir. No sign of enemy troops. - What do you mean, no enemy troops? Over. - I mean, there's no one here except corpses in American uniforms, sir. I repeat, so sign of enemy troops. - Corpses in American uniforms, are you sure? Over. - Yes, sir. I don't know what outfit they're from or why they're here, but I repeat, no sign of enemy troops, over. - That's impossible. Recon said there were extensive personnel. Did you check the entire base? - Motion detectors are showing no sign of anyone but our troop, sir. There's no one-- - Don't trust technology, trust your instincts. The enemy could be all around you. Somebody killed those men. Set up a search and destroy and analyze the black boxes of those dead soldiers, over. - The black boxes were removed from the soldiers, sir, over. - It looks like you've got your hands full there, Doyle. Reinforcements won't be there for another eight hours because of the storm. You've got a job to do. I know you won't disappoint me. Out. - You're not gonna buy this shit, are you? This is the same kind of crap I got fed at Fobos and you got fed at Rigel. - What's your problem, Aldrich? - What's my problem, are you kidding me? Even someone as dumb-ass Army-stupid as you can sense a setup. If you won't take steps to protect the lives of your men, I will. - What did you say, Captain? You're addressing a senior officer. - Oh, cut the shit! You're pulling a Rigel again. You're following orders blindly when it's clear we're going into a setup. - I'm sick of your attitude, Aldrich! Put down your weapon and take off your gear. - What? - Sit down and put your hands over your head. I will not allow you to spread your defeatist attitude. The discipline level in this outfit is bad enough to begin with. I will not let you turn my troops around. Put down your weapon now! - You're either incredibly stupid, in which case I feel sorry for you, or you are incredibly deceitful. (gun clicking) - This is my platoon. I am in charge. You will obey my orders. Put your weapon down now! (gun clattering) Ryan, I need you to report to the command center ASAP. - [Ryan] I'm right down the hall, Major. - [Doyle] Get in here now! - Generator's functioning. What's going on here? - Ryan, this man is your prisoner. - [Ryan] What? - Remove his gear and his shoelaces and don't let him leave your side. - Why, what'd he do? - Insubordination under combat conditions, punishable by death. You have a problem with that, Ryan? - No, Major. - I want everyone to meet me in the main fueling station in five minutes. What? - With all due respect, Major, it looks very strange, one sleeve and all. - Move! (fabric tearing) Alright, listen up, people. In eight hours reinforcements will be here and we'll all be able to leave. You people did your job well. Our orders are to secure a safehouse within the premises and to conduct a search and destroy. The motion detectors show no one on the base, but they may be malfunctioning. To secure the sub-levels we'll do a sweep in three teams. We're all shaken, but we're soldiers and we follow orders. - The hell with the orders, Major. Did you see those bodies back there? I say we get back to the shuttle and I'll fly us all outta here. - Hell, yeah. - I'm with ya! - I'm all packed. - [Poe] Let's blow this joint. - [Siegal] I just wanna go home, man. I wanna get outta here. - Hold on! Our orders are very clear. We're to secure the base for eight hours. - You wanna stay? Stay. - If I might, this place is, uh, well, scary. - You're losing your shot at parole, Siegal. You're too smart for that. - Uh, no, actually I'm too smart to stay here. - Major? I said I'd fight along your side, but I will not fight him. This is his house. These dead men down there, they have met him face to face. - [Karlson] Saint Jones is at it again. - [Cutter] Ryan, you with us? - Look, if they're all gonna leave it makes no sense for the rest of us to stay. No offense, Major. - Looks, like you're gonna be here all by yourself, Major. Hope you packed a good book. - Wait! We ain't leaving her here alive. - The question is whether we knife her or put a bullet in her ass. (laughs) - I say we rape her first. - Bad idea! - Who asked you? - Nobody. I'm not coming with you guys and I thought you might wanna know why. - Why? - Flemming's an asshole, but he's a smart asshole. His scanners pick up the ship taking off, he's gonna blast us out of the sky. We stay here, at least we got a fighting chance. It's our skill against whatever comes at us. Don't do this, man, it's wrong and stupid! - The hell with you, man! You're only standing up for her because she's an officer. I say, kill the bitch. - [Cutter] Yeah! (punching) - He's right, you know. Anybody wants to commit suicide, head for the ship. Be my guest. I have this urge to conduct a quick court martial and execute you two on the spot. However, whoever killed those guys down there probably wants me to do just that. We don't fight as a military unit, we all die! Is that clear enough for you people to understand? So what's it gonna be? - Much as I hate to admit it, the Major makes sense. - I agree. - Me, too. - Oh, well, I'm in. (laughs nervously) So, what's the plan? - As I was saying, orders are to conduct a search and destroy in pairs. Koosman and Goodis, passageway A, move! Ryan and Karlson, B, move! Poe and Jones, C. Siegal and myself move back to storage. And Cutter and Aldrich will booby trap entry points. Move! You on the same planet? - [Poe] Shit. - Aldrich, I'll work with you. Hey, I'm not gonna thank you or anything. - It's not a problem. I didn't do it for you. - I don't get you, Aldrich. - I'll take that as a compliment. - Yeah. - I guess this means that Ryan can give me back my shoelaces. - Yeah. - Agatha. - Major! Complete your sweep of each section and report before you proceed. - [Jones] Sweep corridor C complete, we're proceeding down the east terminal. - [Aldrich] Upper floor and processing center clear, moving to subsection one. (dramatic music) - Goodis, I thought we were supposed to stick together. Goodis, what do you see? What is it? Goodis, what do you see? - [Karlson] B cleared, proceeding to Subsection 4 to check out the generator. - Sorry, I haven't been around a woman in a long time. No, no, no, you don't have to worry about me, no. I just wanna get us out of here alive. - [Karlson] East terminal cleared. - [Koosman] Converter station 11310 cleared. Heading to station 11311. - This place is a damn mausoleum, man. No hostiles, no weapons. Just all those freaky stiffs. Intelligence messed up, there ain't nobody here but us. Let's take a break. - You disappointed you didn't get to kill somebody? - Night's still young, baby. - [Doyle] Aldrich, how are things down there? - [Aldrich] The lab's secured, I'm mining all vents. - [Doyle] Good, check the barracks tunnel next. Ryan and Karlson should have swept the area clean. Doyle out. - [Aldrich] I don't believe you. You picked the wrong time, Cutter. - That's a waste of time, man. Ain't nothing coming through there, man. - Nothing's coming in now. Nothing human. (moaning) - Oh, come on, baby, it's been so long. Feels so good. (punching) - [Poe] Asshole! - Jezebel! - Let him go, Poe! - Get your hands off me, I don't wanna fight you! - Come on, Ryan, if you wanna dance, dance with me. - Don't hit me again! Don't hit me, nothing happened! - What do you mean, nothing happened? Ain't none of his damn business. - Come on, Ryan, me and you. See who the better man is. - I'm not even slightly impressed. What the hell are you doing? - The Angel of Death loves sinners. He's coming for you, Sister Karlson. - Crazy little bitch! (gun clicking) Now, let him go! Or I'll kill you where you stand. - [Ryan] We shouldn't be fighting each other, damn it! Let's get back to work. - Now, let's not make any trouble. Let's get out of here. - [Poe] I'm gonna get you for this, Karlson. - It's strange. - What? - Prisoners, they have prisoner ID bracelets. - Just like us. Oh, God, just like us. Just like us, they were prisoners. Just like us, except you. - You're a smart guy, Siegal. - Thanks. - So what do you think? What's going on here? - I have to go back to ancient Crete; a test, like a labyrinth. The whole maze concept complete with the challenge of defeating the minotaur; half man, half beast and it's a perfect test. - Test? - [Karlson] Barracks, we can finish what we started, lover. - [Ryan] Poe's probably still around here. I thought he was gonna tear me apart. - Oh, wow. As Jones would say, I think this is a sign from above. (laughs) Come on in, mama will kiss it and make it all better. - I think we'd better stick to the orders. - Oh, come on, a little fun isn't gonna hurt anyone. Besides, you'd pass up this? - Come on, I don't wanna make the same mistake twice. - You don't know what you're missing. (dramatic music) (yelling) - [Ryan] You okay? - God, it's you. - It's you, Aldrich. - I'm a little jumpy. Where's Cutter? - He's getting a nap. - A nap? What a good idea. How about it? - Karlson, it's not that I'm not flattered, but it's the wrong time and the wrong place. - I bet you wouldn't turn down the Major, lover boy. I can see right through that tough guy act. (laughs) You like those big blue eyes. You two will look great together at the prom. - See you at recess. (growling) - [Doyle] Aldrich, report, over. - [Aldrich] Ryan and Karlson haven't finished their sweeps of the barracks I'm heading back to the medilab, over. - [Doyle] Got it, Aldrich, out. (growling) (screaming) What was that? All sectors report your status, over. - Cutter? - [Ryan] I think it came from Sector 1. - [Doyle] I want everyone to Section 1 on the double! Cover all the corridors and tunnels. Koosman and Goodis, check the main access corridor. Nobody fire unless you have a clear target. - Major! It's Aldrich, Cutter's dead, I'm in the lab. - Jones! Jones! - Damn! Goddamn it! - [Siegal] Oh, I gotta get out of here, this is a nightmare. I can't believe this, oh, God. - Epimorphine overdose. - He OD'd? - Choked on his own vomit. He must have gotten into my bag. - [Karlson] What about his neck? - [Poe] That much blood didn't come from a syringe. - [Jones] There's something else, look. - [Ryan] What, what is it? - It's crushed. Look at these, bruises, pressure marks. - Oh man, this is bad. This is really bad. - [Siegal] Alright, the enemy is still here. They must have tampered with the motion detectors, but it can't be I checked it. - Where's his black box? - [Karlson] His black box is gone. - This is definitely murder. - [Aldrich] Whoever murdered him must have taken it. - Ryan, Karlson, you were guarding this passageway. Did you see anything? - [Poe] No, they was too busy playing hide the salami. - Is that true? - [Karlson] Not exactly. - Dereliction of duty is a serious offense, Ryan! - Nobody got past us, I swear. - I, I hope we're all thinking the same thing here. Whoever killed Cutter will be coming for us next. We have to stay together, watch each other's backs or-- - Where'd Aldrich go? Come in, Aldrich. Aldrich, where are you? Aldrich, do you read me? Over. (ominous music) - Freeze! Aldrich, what the hell are you doing in here? - Combat data recorder. Somebody's black box. - Well, let's hear it. (recorder echoing) - It's all encrypted, I'm only getting bits and pieces. - It was left for us or for whoever came to clean up. The guy on the recording has gotta be one of the guys in the storage room. - Major, maybe I can create a gopher program which can backpedal the encryption and possibly let us know what this guy's trying to tell us. - Fine, do it. You knew about this and you didn't tell me? - I'm still not sure you're telling me everything. - When are you gonna get off it? Whatever happens to you is gonna happen to me. Like you said, we're in this together. - There's hope for you yet, Agatha. - Major. - Yeah, sure. Let's reexamine the sit. Whoever killed our predecessors probably killed Cutter. - Siegal, motion detectors? - Well, it shows here that we're the only ones on the base. Unless they've created some type of new stealth technology that would, no that doesn't make sense. I mean, motion is motion, organic matter is organic matter our detectors would have picked up something. - [Aldrich] Maybe the sensors aren't picking it up because they're not in the base. Maybe they're outside the base. - [Siegal] No, nobody could survive for very long out in that storm. - [Doyle] Siegal, you stay put here until that black box is decoded. - Right, well, we've got six hours until reinforcements show up. Maybe we could create a defense perimeter and make them make the first move and we just sit back and wait. - Let's do it. - Wait, um, I don't wanna stay here alone. I was just thinking that maybe somebody could stay here with me because I'm not really the kind of guy that's gonna be all-- - Private Siegal, you're a big boy. You have a gun, use it! - Okay. - Anything moves, shoot it. - Right. - We'll hear it. We'll be here in two minutes, okay? - [Doyle] We'll take shifts guarding and resting so everyone stays at a hundred percent. We'll form a perimeter. - Appreciate the support. Thanks. - [Doyle] And cordon off the main entrances. Let's move, Aldrich. (moaning) (radio chattering) - [Aldrich] We've got a secured area so let's talk defense. - Generator room is most defensible, only one way in. - [Aldrich] Yeah, but there's also a drawback; we don't know what military technology we're dealing with. You want defensible, but you want a retreat option. - I don't like to think of retreat as an option. - I don't mean to criticize your military expertise, but as Siegal put it, you're limited in your command of the art of war. - But if you consider retreat as an option you never put your life on the line in attack. - You should never attack if you can't win. You should always dictate the time and place of engagement, keep an ace up your sleeve. That's precisely what we're dealing with. We've been lured in to something. Something else is determining the time and place of engagement. (ominous music) - Yes, baby, come here. Don't be shy. (Karlson moaning) - Karlson I bet, with just about anybody. The human spirit manifests itself in strange places, doesn't it? (Karlson moaning loudly) - Like I said, I don't get you, Aldrich. - Give it a chance, you will. Come on, we've got work to do. - Oh, oh, oh! (grunting) No! No! No! (growling) (screaming) (crunching) - [Siegal] Attention, attention, this is Siegal. We have screams coming from within the secured perimeter. I could use a little backup here at the command center. Somebody, come on! - [Koosman] Who the hell was that? - Karlson. - Where the hell is she? - In here. - [Doyle] Oh, my God, Karlson. - Oh, no! - Jones! - Her black box? - She's gone, Major. She's with him. Someone broke her neck. Someone with powerful hands. - Where were you? - Passageway A. - Who were you with? - I was with Jones and then we split up to cover more territory, be more efficient. You're not gonna pin this on me, bitch! - Wait a minute! So now we're going from an invisible enemy to a 'one of us' theory? That's bullshit! One of us didn't kill those guys back in the storage room. - Nobody said whoever killed them also killed her. She got under your skin, didn't she, Poe? - You bastard, Ryan! (thudding) You're a liar! - Stop it! (grunting) Freeze, Private! (clanging) What the? - [Aldrich] The generator! - What the hell happened to the friggin' lights? - [Ryan] We gotta kill him! - No, hold your fire! - He's guilty, why else would he run? - Koosman, Goodis, get down to the generator room and see what happened to the power. - He's already killed Cutter and Karlson. We've gotta shoot him. - Ryan, Jones, secure the area. - What if we find Poe? - Do what you have to do. Aldrich! - Back to the command center. - [Doyle] Siegal, is the power down in the command center? - [Siegal] No, I still have power. The backup generator must have kicked in. - [Doyle] Is the black box still decoding? - [Siegal] Yes, Major. - [Doyle] We're on our way. (grunting) (beeping) - Major, you gotta help me out here, I'm freaking out. We need reinforcements. When are the reinforcements coming? Tell me, talk to me, talk to me! - Five hours. Pull yourself together, soldier. What's going on with that black box? - The black box is still decoding. I don't think I can take this anymore. - How much longer for decoding? - 66 minutes. Get down here, I'm really worried, come on! - Hup! Listen up, people. Be on alert for Poe. Maintain radio security, he can hear all reports. Proceed with extreme caution. Remember, he destroyed an entire lunar village and he probably killed Cutter and Karlson. If you come across him, terminate him. - Hey Jones, this Angel of Death you keep talking about. Is it man or beast or what? - I picture him as all things. All men and all beasts. - Is he near us? - Oh, yeah, he's near us alright. - Oh, God. - [Koosman] Major, this is Koosman. We've just entered the generator room in Subsection 3. - [Doyle] Any sign of Poe? - [Koosman] Negative, the main power grid's just ahead. - [Doyle] Proceed with extreme caution. Koosman, check the power grid while Goodis covers you. Poe could be anywhere. (electricity buzzing) - Major, this is Koosman. I got some real bad news. - Report. - Power grid's toast. I think it's some kind of sabotage. Looks like it's been pre-set. Could have happened any time. You copy that? - Copy that. - It must have been Poe. Siegal, you got something we can do? - Uh-- - Come on, there's gotta be something! - Alright, Koosman, check the grid wires and tell me if there's any power coming from them, any juice at all. - How the hell should I know? - There should be a yellow wire. I want you to wedge your finger and touch it. Don't worry because it's very low voltage. It won't hurt you. (tense music) (electricity buzzing) - Ow! Siegal, you're a mutant, that hurt! - Good, good, good. That means there's recirculating power coming through it. Alright, the saboteur toasted the grid, but we've still got an energy loop coming off the power source. Compound's main transformers are here, Subsection 4. So, if I'm lucky maybe I can reroute partial power to certain sections, provided nobody else screws with the generator. - Do it! - Well, the only problem with that, Major, is that Subsection 4 is very dark and scary and I'm kind of afraid that, you know, if I have to go there by myself, so maybe I'm not really the right guy cut out for the job. I was thinking maybe you could send somebody else and then I won't-- - I'll go. - Negative, I have another job for you. Koosman, meet Siegal at the east end of Subsection 4. Leave Goodis to guard the generator. - Major, I'm no electrician! What does he need me to hold his hand for? - Koosman, that's an order. - Goodis, I'm not leaving you here alone. Bastard, Poe. Alright, alright. Just watch this door, it's the only way in or out. If anything comes through this door, blast it. - [Doyle] Ryan, Jones, split up and scissor Substation 5. - You go straight and I'll take the left. - Wait, wait, wait! I don't think we should split up. - You saw the layouts. These passages meet up after 50 yards. Major, we copy. - [Koosman] This is Koosman, I'm in position. Send me mutant boy. - Siegal, you have your escort. Now move! Move it! Move! - [Siegal] Okay, okay, Siegal's moving. - Aldrich, I want you to head the search for Poe. I'm gonna stay here with the black box. - I got it. - [Man On Black Box] Experiment. Savage killings. (static buzzing) Extended search. Determined. Remain. The pawns in. Death. (static buzzing) (ominous music) (dramatic music) (heavy breathing) (dramatic music) (footsteps running) (growling) (roaring) (screaming) - Hey! - Christ, man! You scared the hell out of me! - You scared the hell out of me! - You punk! - Don't call me a punk! Here's the box. Damn, it's stuck! - There, now it's open. - Nice job, tough guy. - Get to work. - [Doyle] Koosman, any contact with Poe? - [Koosman] Negative, I'm just babysitting the mutant. - [Doyle] Aldrich, anything? - [Aldrich] Nothing. - [Doyle] Ryan, report. - [Ryan] No sign of anyone, Major. - [Doyle] Keep an eye out, people. - [Jones] Sorry. - Any sign of Poe? - No. - What about Ryan? - We split up, but he can't be too far ahead. - Come on, come on. - [Siegal] God, the equipment in this place is archaic. - You done? - Done. - [Koosman] Major, we're done here. I'm heading back to the generator room. - [Man On Black Box] Death. - Goodis, we're coming back. Goodis? Goodis, if you copy me tap twice on your comm link. Goodis, are you there? Tap twice on your comm link. Goodis. Goodis, Christ, do you copy? Major, we're on our way back to the generator room. I think something might be wrong with Goodis. - [Aldrich] It's Aldrich, I'm gonna meet up with them. - [Koosman] Goodis, where are you? Goodis, Goodis, where are you? (tragic music) (groaning) (Koosman wailing) - Go, go, go! (screaming) - Okay, okay. Aldrich, Aldrich! - [Jones] Go! - [Ryan] Ryan, Ryan! - Get over here! Go! Go! (Koosman wailing) - Aldrich, Aldrich, you gotta help Koosman, man, he's losing it. - [Jones] Koosman, let go of her so I can work. - [Koosman] No! - Come on, man, let her go. She's gone, let her go, let her go! - [Doyle] Aldrich, report. What the hell is going on? - Goodis, Goodis is dead. - [Jones] Same cause of death as the others. - How, check her black box. - The black box is gone, but there's teeth marks in her throat. It looks like she was mauled to death. - Are you saying some kind of animal did this? - Whatever it was, it's just getting warmed up. - Oh no, hold on. Cutter and Karlson both have neck wounds. What goes for the throat other than man's natural predator? - [Aldrich] We don't have any natural predators. - Don't be so sure. (Koosman wailing) - Who is screaming? - Koosman, I just gave him a sedative. - It's gotta be Poe, right? I mean, we're all here. The rest of us are all here! - This whole operation was a systems crash from the boot up! Don't you see, why else would they put a group of people like this together? Unless it was... - What, what? What? - A test. - What kind of test? - [Ryan] A test? - Think about it. All of you are trained professional killers, every one of you. But there's one who's stronger, quicker, faster and that one is thinning the herd. - What about the dead soldiers? - They're not soldiers, they're prisoners like us. - [Ryan] Oh, God, oh, God. - What? - Yeah. Oh, your friend Doyle didn't tell you? Yeah. - [Aldrich] Major, we're coming back to the command center. (groaning) Keep Koosman quiet! - [Ryan] The guy's in shock. - [Jones] Don't let his head drop, keep his neck straight. - [Doyle] We need to know what's recorded on this black box, Siegal. Make that your highest priority. - All computer power has been diverted to decoding the black box. That means no motion detectors, sir. - So we have no way of tracking Poe? - That's correct. - Secure the area, rig the adjoining passageways with explosives. - We can't, we don't have enough charges. - [Aldrich] Well, if we don't get some fast there won't be anyone left alive when reinforcements get here. - [Doyle] What about in the shuttle? - Yeah, well, sure. But who's gonna go out there and get them? Oh, no, Major, no. What if Poe has the same idea? - That's an order, Ryan. You're demolitions, it's your responsibility. Someone else might accidentally set off the charges. Suit up, move! Ryan, we can see your light. You're doing fine, just keep moving east. Ryan, give me a sit rep. - [Ryan] The wind's so strong I can't see a thing out here. You're gonna have to guide me. Can you see me from your position? - Keep going straight. Do you have a visual on the ship? - [Ryan] Negative. - [Doyle] Move to your right. - [Ryan] I don't like this, Major. If Poe doesn't get me I'm gonna be buried alive in this storm. - [Doyle] Poe can't be out there. All the pressure suits have been accounted for. - [Ryan] No healthy human could survive out here. What if he's got an enemy suit? - [Doyle] Just get to the shuttle, you're almost there. - [Ryan] It's hard to move against this wind. Wait, I see something. - [Doyle] You're right by the ship. - [Ryan] I'm accessing the outer door. In the inner door, I'm inside. The place looks clear. There's nothing here, thank God. - [Doyle] What do you see? Can you get to the charges? - There's something beeping. (ominous music) Oh, my God! (exploding) - [Koosman] What the hell was that? - Ryan! Ryan, come in! Ryan! - I'm going after him. - Aldrich, plant yourself, it's too dangerous! - He could still be alive, there's still a chance. - [Siegal] Are you crazy? There's no way he could have survived that. - Come on. Let's stay back to back so Poe can't sneak up on us. - [Aldrich] He couldn't have had a suit, they were all accounted for. - [Doyle] Unless he set the bomb in advance. - [Aldrich] But Ryan's the demolitions expert. - [Doyle] He was in the Shock Troops. He could have easily learned about explosives there. - [Aldrich] That's combat training. Wait, what's this? - [Doyle] Wreckage, we must be close. Let's keep moving east. Any sign of him? - [Aldrich] Ryan, Ryan! - [Doyle] The shuttle must be completely destroyed. - [Aldrich] Wait, I see something. I think it might be... Doyle, here. - [Doyle] Ryan, can you hear me? - [Aldrich] He doesn't hear you. He's dead. I don't see his black box. - [Doyle] I don't get it. If it's Poe, how did he get his black box out here? - [Aldrich] I don't know, this is strange. I would have expected more damage from the explosion. - [Doyle] He must have been blown clear in the blast. - [Aldrich] Even if Ryan had survived his pressure suit is ripped to shreds. - [Doyle] If Poe managed to get his black box that means he could be out here now. We'd better get back to base. (dramatic music) - Four dead? What happened, Doyle? Over. - Someone, some thing, maybe even one of us, Poe. I'm not sure, over. - Not quite sure, Doyle? Have you deployed your men? Have you combed every inch of that plant? Are you positive there are no hostiles in that facility? Are you using good judgment? Over. - Yes, sir. I, I just, I wanted to ask you about the dead men we found here, sir. - No questions, Doyle. This is not a secure line. Reinforcements will be there in four hours. Now, I want you to set up the LZ landing lights and trigger the homing beacon so the pilot can see you in the storm. Do you think you can handle that, Doyle? Over. - Yes, sir. - [Flemming] Major, I'm very disappointed in you. Flemming over and out. - The homing beacon is located here, the middle of the base. The LZ lights, which control the facility, are located over here near the shuttle port facility. That's where the controls are near the airlocks. - [Aldrich] We need those lights so they can find us. - Right. Siegal, you and Koosman switch on the LZ lights. Aldrich and I will activate the beacon. - [Aldrich] We can still make it out of here in one piece. Whatever you do, don't split up and keep your heads. Major, you coming? - Jones, I want you to guard the command center and if anyone walks through that door, I mean anyone, you kill 'em. Let's go. (dramatic music) - [Aldrich] Why didn't you tell me about the prisoner's ID tags? - I didn't trust you, I guess. - You didn't trust me? I'm the guy in the trench next to you and you don't trust me? You'd rather trust the brass? - It's Rigel all over again, okay? I just got some of my men killed again. What the hell is wrong with me? How stupid am I? You knew better at Fobos, didn't you? You pulled back. You protected your men. You didn't trust Flemming, did you? When it came down to your men's lives you only trusted your own instincts, didn't you? Didn't you? (clattering) - [Aldrich] It's just a busted steam pipe. - Here it is. - [Aldrich] Koosman, Siegal, we're in, report your position. - [Koosman] We're heading through the main processing plant. We're almost there. - [Aldrich] Homing beacon commands, frequencies. - Let's get cracking. - What do I do? - Turn everything on. No, don't open the door. Turn everything on. (grunting) Damn, it's stuck! - [Koosman] Doyle, we're at the LZ switch box, but we're having problems with it, the lever's stuck. - [Doyle] Just get it done! Without those lights they can't find us. I'm counting on you! - The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want. (radio chattering) He maketh me to lie down in green pastures. He leadeth me beside the still waters. (dramatic music) - Northwest entry coordinates. Zero mark, two mark, niner. - Zero, two, niner, confirmed. - Ten clicks from Proteus crater. - Ten clicks, confirmed. - LZ grid 12, south by southwest. - LZ, south by southwest, confirmed. (grunting) (clanging) - Beautiful. - [Koosman] We did it. - [Siegal] Koosman, you coming? - We might just get out of this hellhole alive. - Major, LZ is lit like a Christmas tree. - Good work, Siegal. Meet us back at the command center on the double. - Roger that. - We did it, Aldrich. - You did it, Agatha. Take the credit you deserve. - You're not gonna cut out this Agatha shit, are you? - What's wrong with Agatha? - It's a stupid name! - What about Aggie? - God, no, can't you just call me Doyle? - Sure. (creaking) (thumping) - [Computer] Four, three, two, one, decoding complete. - Major, this is Jones. The computer finished cleaning our black box. - [Doyle] Put it on the comm link. - [Woolrich] Acting on orders from Commander Flemming my unit attacked Sornath but found no enemy troops. We secured the base, then it started. My men killed, one by one. Savage killings, the work of an animal. Killer strength, inhuman. After an extended search we have determined there are no troops in the compound. Only five of us remain. The killer must be one of us. I fear we are the pawns in a diabolical game of death. We're running out of options and I'm so very tired. Commander Woolrich, Company C, out. - [Siegal] Major, it's exactly as I thought. If we don't get out of here, we're all gonna die. - Flemming. Shit. (banging) (growling) - Major, I'm not alone. - Jones, get the hell out of there! (pounding) - I'm locked in. - Maintain, Jones, we're on our way. - Siegal, how far are you from the command center? - We're at the substation level. We'll get there as fast as we can. - Thy rod, thy staff, they comfort me. (growling) They comfort me! (gun firing) - [Doyle] Jones, are you okay? (shouting) (gun firing) Come in, Jones! What's happening? (suspenseful music) (growling) (screaming) Take it slow, Aldrich. Back to back at all times. Look, someone broke in through the vent. It has to be Poe. He's the only one strong enough. - Jones! (banging) Jones! - I'm smashing the exterior locking system so we can get in. Now! Oh, Jones. Oh, my God. Behind you! (guns firing) I'll cover you. Go! - [Aldrich] Let's go! - [Doyle] Koosman, Siegal, Poe's after us. Move away from the command center, now! - [Poe] You're a dead woman! - [Doyle] Meet us at docking bay 94. We'll be there in three minutes. - Affirmative, Major, we're on our way! Siegal, you idiot, come on! (panting) - Koosman? Koosman! Koosman! Koosman, where are you? Koosman! Major Doyle, Major Doyle, this is Siegal where-- - [Doyle] Siegal, where are you? Meet us in docking bay 94. - Koosman? Koosman? Koosman, is that you? Koosman? - [Doyle] Siegal, come in, Siegal! Give us your position. Siegal, are you alright? (roaring) (screaming) - [Siegal] Oh, God, no! (screaming) - Siegal! (groaning) - Who was it? What was it? - It, it was beast. It was man. It was... (groaning) - Koosman, come in, Koosman. Koosman, where are you? - I don't know. I'm lost. Oh, God, I'm gonna die in this maze. - No, you're not! Describe to me where you are. We can't be too far from you. Just keep moving, we'll see you. - [Koosman] There's a lot of pipes and a runoff gulley and a fuel line overhead. - [Doyle] Good, you're in the shuttle refueling docks. There's a left side passageway up ahead. Take it and the next intersection turn left. We're on the same path. - Yes, Major, I hear you. I'm right in front of you. (growling) - No, Koosman, that's not us! (roaring) (screaming) No! - Go, go, go! (gun firing) Wait, wait I got an idea. I'll take care of Poe, go back to the LZ. - [Doyle] What do you mean you'll take care of Poe? - I got a plan. (growling) A camera? What the hell? (footsteps clomping) (yelling) (metal clanging) (punching) (thudding) - [Poe] I'm gonna toy with you before I kill you, Aldrich. - You bloody murderer! - I didn't kill anybody, I'm telling you! But maybe you did it. I'm not taking any chances. (thudding) (yelling) - Poe, just tell me, you're the killer. - I'm not falling for this, Aldrich. I did not enjoy killing all those villagers. My commanding officer ordered me to exterminate anything that moved and I did. The Army made me what I am and you are Army. (growling) What the hell? - Poe, I'm not the one. - Listen, listen. (yelling) Let's dance, sucker. This is Mr. Poe's house. (dramatic music) (roaring) (screaming) - [Aldrich] Poe, oh, God. - Aldrich. I heard screaming, I thought it was you. What the hell happened here? - You know what happened here. It's only you and I left. And I'm not the one, you are. You're Flemming's plant. - What the hell are you talking about? Have you lost your mind? Unless, of course, it's you, right? - I knew not to trust you. What the hell are you? Some kind of genetically engineered freak? A shape shifter prototype? - Calm down. Reinforcements will be here in less than an hour. We can sort everything out. - Yeah, like you worked out these bodies! I was in jail and you were here. You killed these men, then you led us here. You're Flemming's perfect little soldier. - The only reason you got out of jail was so that you could be Flemming's plant. Don't move! - What about that? (punching) (grunting) All that talk about being a good officer and caring about your men. - Don't make me kill you, Aldrich. I think I know you did it. But as long as there's doubt. I was actually beginning to trust you. - Yeah, sure you were. (grunting) (gun firing) - That's my boy, no hesitation. - He'll be heading for the LZ now, General. (laughs) I can only imagine what'll go through Captain Aldrich's mind when he finds out. - ETA, Station Sornath, 20 minutes. You all got your orders, correct? - [Soldiers] Yes, sir! - Alright. It's one on one now. (growling) (dramatic music) - [Ryan] Surprised I'm still alive? - Ryan, it was you? I killed Doyle for nothing? (gun firing) What the hell are you? - [Ryan] I'm the perfect soldier, the perfect hunter. I can survive beyond what mere humans can endure. I can adapt to any situation. - But you were dead, I saw you. How, how did you survive without a pressure suit? - [Ryan] My genetic transformation allows me to adapt to harsh conditions. It toughens my flesh, regulates my breathing, heightens my senses, increases my reflexes. I am the perfect soldier; more aggressive, more alert, more deadly. I am the perfect hunter. Armed with the weapons of man, but the instincts of a lizard. I do not hesitate to do what is necessary. (roaring) - [Aldrich] Why kill your fellow soldiers? - [Ryan] I am a destroyer. I am a good soldier. I follow orders. A good soldier does what he's told and I was told to kill you all as I will now kill you, Aldrich. - Where are you? You freak! Ryan, you cowardly son of a bitch! (gun clicking) - [Ryan] Ryan isn't here. Call me Legion, for we are many. (hissing) (knife clattering) (thudding) (yelling) - Hey, take this! (clanging) (groaning) (screaming) - Ryan! - Major. Just follow orders. Afraid to die. - Freeze! I said hold that position! Yastremski, check the Legion. You faked her death. You retreated when you saw the Legion coming at you. You had Doyle attack it from the rear. You must have planned this when you two were wrestling for the gun. You laid a trap for the Legion. Smart. Yastremski, how is he? - Not good. Could be saved with a lot of work, but why bother? This test run is obviously only partially successful. The Legion is still beatable, they win. (groaning) We need to spend more time on the Legion, come up with a better prototype. - We won? You monster! This is a game? Soldiers die because of a game? (punching) - Don't! You've won. You've won the game. You've seen the Legion in action and up close. You're a fine military mind and I'd be proud to have you in my command again. Join the project. - Project? - The project Legion. The ultimate soldier; deadly, obedient, no emotions, no flaws. It's the edge that can win us the war. Don't you see? Our firepower, technology. It's identical to the enemy so they cancel each other out. But with my idea it's back to the basic unit; man, genetically programmed. A creature with a primordial mind of a lizard. - This is the part where I say you're mad. - You know I'm not mad. I'm a professional soldier. I have a goal and my goal is to win at any cost and that's where you have a flaw. Your flaw is you don't wanna win badly enough. Your downfall is that you're obstinate and you have way too many principles. That's why I have to put a bullet in your brain. - Damn you! - Excuse me, ladies first. (gun firing) (yelling) (guns firing) (yelling) (dramatic music) - [Narrator] On August 12th, 2036, in a daring raid on an enemy installation, General Flemming was killed in action. Major Doyle and Captain Aldrich are MIA and presumed dead. General Flemming was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor. (dramatic music)
