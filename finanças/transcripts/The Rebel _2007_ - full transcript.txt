RETURN INDOCHINA TO ITS PEOPLE! WE, THE VO TRONG CANH REBELLION, HEREBY CONVICT THE INDOCHINA SECRETARY OF SECURITY FOR THE CRIME OF INVASION, AND CALL FOR HIS EXECUTION. The Frightfulness. So what? You have to see for yourself. It can spit out a firestorm, and level this city in an an eye-blink. It's useless for the rebels. With the secretary soft-handling these rebels, the rebels will be rampant. It shows what people want. The sky here is narrow as a water well rim. That's why they need men like you and I. Do you really think the French can kill all the rebels with this? Having said that, I may as well join them. Among us, you resemble them most. Cuong, you are a clever talker. Why don't you ask the rebels so that we both can follow him? The simplest solution is to chop off all their heads, gather them up, and set an example for once. VO TRONG CANH'S BAND OF REBELS Excuse me. Where's the train station? I don't know. Such a gentleman doesn't know? I'm sorry. Sorry for bothering you. CONVICTION LETTER Go go go! Get away! Halt! Put the gun down. Put it down! What a surprise. What are you standing there for? What's wrong with you? Where is your father? Fess up. Where's the hideout? Be a good girl. Tell me. Only cowards torture women. I'm falling for her. But she is so insolent. SECRET POLICE HEADQUARTERS Three officers were assassinated recently. De Canh... always shows respect for the French. He's a coward. He is nothing. -Nothing? -Nothing. And this? Also nothing? I guess if my father were a drunk, who lost all his braids and was demoted, I'd feel like a failure as well. What a pity that children are not capable of killing their fathers. I've been here for ten years. I'm waiting for the day I can go home. But once I'll be on French soil, they'll need someone to take my post. Bring me De Canh's head. Prove to me you're not the imbecile your father was. Tell me, child. Tell me, and the pain will go away. Where is he? Where is he? Where's your daddy's hideout? No? Mute? Stubborn? What are you doing? Who's in command here? Who? Do you need salt water to wake her up? That's enough. Stay still. Put the gun down. Put it down! You knew in advance. About what? The assassination. Where's your proof? I saw you shoot the assassin before he made a move. Good. I'm impressed. -So what? -Hey, we're all brothers here. I don't have to tell you everything. Derue will see through you. You are threatening me? You let them kill the secretary for what? -To catch a few rebels? -That's it. Good question. Sit down. Sit down! None have made it out alive. Your father and his men will live in peace and prosperity if he surrenders. And become traitors like you? Where have you been? Bloody places. It makes heroes out of men. How can a killer find peace? You're not a killer. You're a law executor. What do you know about De Canh? That savage is still alive? Kill a man like him and a hundred more would rise. The Emperor was once worshipped like a god, but now he's just a puppet of the French. You must absorb their beauty and advancement, and aspire to it yourself. It was the French that took your power. Now they steal your soul with this opium. They gave me a noble son. You're wrong! Mother was the one who gave you a son. If so, then do as I say for your mother's sake and not for mine. Have you ever loved Mom sincerely by far? The most wonderful thing in life is a woman's love. Never disappoint her like I have disappointed your mother. PROCLAMATION Scared? PROCLAMATION ...MUST ACCEPT CAPITAL PUNISHMENT There are worse things than death. Of course. But I need you alive. This is a trap. And I'm the bait to catch my father. You're smart, but that's no use. My father will kill each of you! Before your mother passed away, she made me promise her... not to let you fight this war. I failed her. There are worse things than death. Like losing a daughter. Your sacrifice won't save your father. There is a mole in your organization. Remember the death of the rickshaw coolie? Six guards, two French officers, and a sharpshooter. Why are you doing this? Does it matter? You have nothing to lose. Open the door. Stop. Hey you, turn around. Open it! Do as she says. Open the door. Open the door. Stop! Stop! Stop! Ransack for her! What's up? A prisoner escaped, sir. Besiege this area! Yes, sir. Get the dogs. Follow me. Where are we? The safest place. I'll get you another outfit. Who is the mole? Tell me! If I'd known, the assassination wouldn't have happened. And they wouldn't have had you to bait your father. So what's the trick? If you think this is a trick, then why did you escape? I had no options! We don't always have that luxury. But you do. Why are you helping me? There is still a chance for you, your father and his men. Why do you care about us? You wouldn't believe me if I told you. Just tell me. I'm tired of all the bloodshed. Haven't you had enough? And now you want redemption? I just want to live in peace and order. By killing your own people? Murderers must be punished. Murderers? These murderers are only fighting for their homeland. In our eyes, you're the murderer! If you take it that way, you can take revenge for your friends now. This is too easy for you. You have to live and face your own guilt. There is a manhunt out there. I have to unmask the mole. You'll need me to get out of the city. CONVICTION LETTER You woke up so late. The servant forgot to wake you up? Looking for this? Of all the beautiful women you could have, you betrayed me for this bitch. Sy! We have to leave this car. I need an identity document. You're putting my family at risk. Just help me. Finish those IDs. Do you take me as a friend? That's why I came here. Tell me the truth. Why do you keep heading to this? Do you know what it is like shooting somebody? I know I can't change your mind, but remember if you do this, there's no turning back. Also, you and the girl were never here today. I need to do one more thing. But I don't have time. Give me ten minutes. It's important. Give me my papers. I have become a wanted man. This could be the last time I see my father. I have to leave the city. I don't know when I'll be back. Make me proud, son. No matter what I do, it will never make up for what you did to Mother. To the left! Did you see the girl? Has anyone seen the girl? Stop right there! Turn around! Die! Bastard! Die you bastard! Quick, quick, come on! Faster! Let's go. Stop! Come down out of there. -Go. -Get in the truck. Don't. You kill people for no reason? Why do you care so much about them? Our people are on this truck. Time to use your head... or what's left of it. Think really hard, Cuong must have told you something. All I remember is the smell of opium. Allow me to refresh your memory. Wait. Please have some tea. Waste of time. Let's cut out his tongue. Then how is he going to talk? Now what else do you remember? I would not tell you even if I knew. A tiger, though cruel, will not devour its cub. Yes, Colonel. It's me... Danh. What have you got? They killed the informant. Thank you. You're a freedom fighter? -Where are they taking us to? -To the iron mines. Come down. You'll die of thirst up there. In 1898, France decided to heavily strike and seize Hanoi. With the complicity of the prisoners, it organized... Quick! Don't look around! No looking! Work! My mother was an Indochinese too. I share half of your blood, but France is my homeland. France is calling me to duty. And your mother? Wasn't she a prostitute? There is no shame in that! I have works to do. Perhaps I was wrong about you. Tessier is dead. You got that? He's dead! You're not the right man for the job. Cuong... he'll become a better leader. I am a leader, sir. You're a leader... You a leader? Then arrest them! Son of a bitch! I have to stay calm. Oh, Mom! Stay calm. You, come here! -What's your name? -Hung. -Hung what? -Pham The Hung. Wrong, moron. There's nobody here by that name. Now that you're here, you don't need a name anymore, just a number. From now on you are number 3709. You got it? Now, I ask you again. What's your name? My father named me Hung. You better assume that you never had a father. Hey! Men to the right, women to the left. Move! Here! What are you looking at? The woods. I can see that. Here is a goddamn cage. How did you end up here? Couldn't afford paying their tax. I'm just a servant. Everyone is subject to the law. What about laws that sanction slavery? No such law. You think people volunteered to come here? One way or the other, we will all end up on that truck. Move away! Stand up! Lazy scum. Don't pretend. I said stand up! Stand up! Please don't hurt my husband! Get up! No food or water for these two today! Sir, I beg you. Please forgive him. Sir, I beg you. No food or water for these two today! Understood? I see a way out of here. Be quiet! Is that all you can see? They left the key in the ignition. Look at them. Have you ever seen a bunch of lazier bastards? We do all the work and they spend their time eating. They're the white man's burden. Take it. You have to eat for our child. Who fed these dogs? Who gave food to these two? -Nobody? -Who? Nobody? Nobody? I am simply going to beat these two to death! I am going to beat these two to death! I did. -Come here. -Come here. -Turn around. -Turn around. Put your guns down! -Drop them! -Put the guns down. Follow that railroad to the north. We'll reach a station. Do you smell that? What? A hound. We ran out of gas. Look, the station shouldn't be far from here. We'll be on the first train tomorrow. I think it's best if I take the train alone. No matter what, you don't trust me, do you? It's not that. Then what? Don't think you helped me then my father will forgive what you've done. That young boy I killed in that assassination... He was a brave kid. Who was he? Just a boy from my village. He wanted to make his father proud. What did he know about this war? He knew those that come to this land take what doesn't belong to them. When I was in France, everywhere I went... I dreamed that one day our country would have such magnificent things too. I know we have so much to do. I know the French aren't all bad. They modernized this country... roads, cities. But are those things worth the price of our freedom? When I was ten, my father was arrested, and accused of being a rebel sympathizer. My mother sold all of our possessions to bribe the French officials. We became miserable. But all of that was just the beginning. Until... they wanted more. They wanted my mother. All of them. Then my father was released... But they told him what my mother did... to save him. He totally collapsed. From that time on, my parents became distant. Then... a fetus of the white devils was growing inside of her. I found her body in the river, far from my village. No one died with more sorrow than my tender mother. Can we forget who we are for a moment? Just tonight? Think you can just disappear and start a family? It was an accident. Accident? A French officer was shot in the opium den. An accident? He should've known what duty I was on, don't you think? You didn't follow any plan, so how do you ask others to beware? Took the future bride to see your old man? Don't you understand? It may have been the last time I could see him. Maybe. But for sure, your old man will never see you the same way again. Don't push your luck. Where is she taking you to? Huh? Speak up! I will look after your father. She will take the train to the north. I'm only going to say this once. You and your girlfriend better be on that train. Where have you been? I have found the way to the train station. It's not far away. We are not taking the train. We're not? What happened? I lied, because I didn't trust you. Want to escape from me? She misled me. What are you staying here for? Go home and bury your father. I've got something to tell you. Get some rest. Father? My daughter. DEATH SENTENCE Who is he? Close the door. He helped me escape. Just answer me. He was an agent, but now he is a fugitive. A hound is still a hound. You don't understand. I understand who we are. And why people in this village are risking their lives to hide us. You don't have to tell me that. You brought home a traitor! I thought you were better than this. No, I'm a fool. And so are you. Hey. -You have to leave now. -What is it? Someone saw us. You don't get it? People think you're here to kill my father. What are you doing? Step away! You have to trust me. He's not a spy. Put the gun down. If you want to kill him, shoot me first. Father. Tell us by yourself, who you really are. Come over here. Here. No shouting. Put it down. Speak up! Let me answer that question. Congratulations, Lieutenant. Your mission is finally completed. This village is yours. I missed you much, sweetie. It's an honor to meet you in person. Your father-in-law is coming with me. You want to be a rebel? Do you? Then join them! Blindfold them. Attention! Ready! Take my blindfold off . Tell me if you see the bullet. This village is sacred. No foreigners have entered and made it out alive. You want to see how you die? Want to witness how you're going to die? Finally, a worthy passenger. Such a pleasure. Welcome aboard. And you... it's time for you to step up. At last I can retire. It's over. You can go out. Such a pity we don't always get what we want. Let me introduce your new boss, Colonel Renoir. Behind you, look. I know your mother's story. Sorry about her. Think about this. You can't get away with all these killings. I didn't kill you. He did. Did you really think you could take my place? Now you can go home. I bet you enjoyed this. I'll enjoy even more when I'll sit in his chair, drink champagne, and celebrate your death. Fall in! Ready! Take aim! Father! Father! Shoot! Kill them! You have a bigger fight. Protect the spirit of this rebellion. Save your father. I can't leave the village like this. Your father is the faith of this nation. You've spent your entire life fighting for others. In the end, you can't even save your own daughter. On the right. Correct! Here! This side, this side. Fire back! Prepare for attack! -Mount your bayonets! -Yes, sir! Watch him. Last one. Get up! Go! Any tricks and I'll shoot you. Your old man or the girl... Your choice. On the count of three, if you don't kill him, I'll slit her throat. One... Two... Three. I'll bury you next to your father. This goddamn move hurts!
