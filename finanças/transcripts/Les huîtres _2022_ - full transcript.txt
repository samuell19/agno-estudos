I can't see any. But don't worry, we'll find some. Wait, I'll ask her. Charlotte? - Yes? You didn't get back to Élé about the spa. It's our turn, I'll call you back, OK? Élé, I'll be there! Sorry I didn't let you know. Yeah. Great. See you later. Bye. You OK? - Yeah, fine. It's been so long since we were all together. It'll be fine. - Yes, sure. I can't wait. - If you're uncomfortable, you can leave. I'll leave with Sophie, in the car. I want to be there all weekend. I've just told her I won't be at the wedding. What did you tell her? - Everything. Not really! I said I had a work thing. That I had a screening I couldn't miss. It's a shame you'll miss the wedding. I'm sorry. It's fine. Don't worry. Ladies, can I help you? Hello. - Hello, madam. Do you have oysters for seven, please? Oysters? Yes, tons. And I speak French. I'll get them, I'll be right back. Oysters Yoo hoo! - Hi! Come on in! - Hi! I'm so happy to see you again! Girls, you saved my life. I totally forgot the oysters. They weren't too expensive? - No. Besides, Rozenn did some bartering. Come with me. Shh. Not a word. Ready? Not so fast! I didn't cheat. - You did! I didn't! - How many fingers? One! And I know which one, bitch! Cheat! Is that Rozenn? What? Not even a hint of suspense? You must be cheating! - Roro, you're always late. Don't take the blindfold off. One more to guess. OK. - Hold out your hands. Who is it? Soft hands. They're smaller. Who is it? - Think! Come on! - She bites her nails. Bad girl. Wait... Can I have a clue? - No. Aw, go on. - Think! She's a ghost. What? She's like a sniffer dog. She's not a smoker, anyway. I know that smell. Hang on. I know, it's amber. Charlotte? Yes. Surprise! Well done! She got you by your smell, girl. How are you, sweetie? It's an island, off the coast of Bolivia. There are oysters everywhere. I swear. The guys fish oysters and eat them right away. We were going to stay 3 days, but in the end... Can I help? - We're fine, thanks. And...? You can take my place, if you like. Do you know how? - Not really. Will you show me? - Take this. Right, take the oyster and hold it tight. Put your thumb on the blade, here. Stick it in two thirds of the way along. Normally, it should open. OK? - Almost. It's tough, huh? - How did the screening go? Great! There was a big crowd. The film about your grandmother, right? - No, another one. We don't know how to turn the music on. Please help us. And you? How's work? Getting back to work was tough, but it's fine now. Back to work? Did you go on vacation? - No, I went to Paris to see my sister for two weeks. - And you didn't let me know? I was back and forth to hospital and looking after her kids... Why the hospital visits? My sister had cancer last year. Sorry, I didn't know. - Don't worry. Is she OK? - Much better this past year. She's in remission. Nobody told me. Come on, girls! Come on, let's go. Cheers! You like her? - She troubles me. I don't know if... - Just a second. Could you pass me that phone? Jeez! I knew it! Charlotte, you're such a pain! Rosie, Rosie! C'mon, girls. - What's going on? Tell us what's up. - Can I tell them? Spit it out. What's going on? When we got the oysters at the fishmonger's, Rozenn fell for the fishmonger! That's great! - They chatted for three hours. So that's why you were late! You seemed to hang on his every word. It was fascinating. - Yeah, right... He said: "Did you know that pearls result from a defense mechanism?" He didn't talk like that. "When a grain of sand enters the shell and irritates the flesh, the oysters coats it in layers of mother of pearl to protect itself." I reckon it'll be more than a grain of sand entering your oyster... Really! Read us his message. - Out with it. "Hi, you seem super cool. Fancy a drink..." And some mussels with fries? Attention, ladies. We have a surprise for you, Inès. Ready? Er... yes. All right, then... Here we go. Yoo hoo, my love. I hope you're wasted, that they're making your life hell. Hi Thais, hi Rozenn, hi Sophie... And Ludo? Come for your cat whenever you like. My cat's gonna be starving. I'll find him dead. I asked him some questions and you must say exactly what he replied. Otherwise... - You drink a shot. OK. - Ready? First question. When did you know you were in love with Inès? That's a really tough question. - Put yourself in his place. Actually, Loïc loved me from the word go. He just didn't know. - Liar! It's true. He's just a slow starter... Like his sister. "Like his sister!" - Everyone knows twins only have one brain. Knock it off, you two. Answer the question. I'd say during our trip to Portugal. Are you sure? - I think so. During her final. We embraced and kissed. That's how it started. - Sweet! Drink, drink. - What's your favorite part of her body? My breasts. That's for sure. My favorite part of her body is her dimples. Jeez, what a liar! - What do you like about him? I love his ass! Which is actually quite like his father's. Inès! It's bad enough you're banging my brother. Embarrassing! Let's move on. How many partners before Inès? - None! Uh-oh, this sniffs of a fit of jealousy. How many chicks did he bring home, Ludo? I won't blab about the family. Nobody! I'm Miss Inès. What did he say? - Well, I'd say Inès. Let's drink to love! Are you OK? - Yes, fine. Sure? - I need some air. Yes, Inès, you're the one and only. Are you OK? Am I interrupting? - Not at all. Who wants champagne? Champagne anyone? I'll get Élé... Are you leaving? No, I just need some fresh air. It's open! It's just an old building. You OK, Charlotte? She's just had a bit too much to drink. What's happening? - Everything's fine. Really? - Yes. If you want to leave, go. She just wants some fresh air. That's what she said last time. Drop it, Ludo. - No, she does this every time. There comes a time... It's true, isn't it? I'd better leave. - Here we go again. You're being very aggressive. - Rozenn, it's fine. I'm tired. I'd rather go. - Where to? Home. - Nonsense. You're sure? - Yes. I'll come with you. - No, Roro, not you too! I'll come to the spa tomorrow. Pick me up at the station. Rozenn, it's fine. You stay, I'll go. OK? OK, Cha, go. But it's raining, take care on the road. I'll be fine. - I don't get it. We were having fun. It's not worth trying to understand. You're right, better not try to understand. What do you mean by that? Why do you say that? What should I understand? You haven't answered my messages for years now. Tell me! Cha... What did I do to you? You did nothing. - What then? Spit it out. - Not like this. Let's get to the bottom of this. I miss you so much, Cha. Tell me what's wrong. I was raped. By Loïc. What? It happened before you were together. Otherwise, I swear, I would have told you. I don't understand. It was during the weekend in Ostend. We were wasted. At one point, I woke up and Loïc was inside me. Wait, Ludo. How long have you known this? Why didn't you say something? - It wasn't up to me. Cha, I'm so sorry. Inès! Let go of the knife. - It's nonsense. Let go of the knife. - You'll hurt yourself. She's talking nonsense. Drop the knife. - Drop it. Calm down. - It's fine, Sophie. Stop, Inès. Are you OK? - Goddammit! Let me take a look. I'm sorry. Let's go to the bathroom. I'm so sorry. We're going to get married. In a week. It will be a beautiful wedding. It will be a beautiful wedding. And you're all invited. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Are you OK? Subtitling: Tongues Untied
