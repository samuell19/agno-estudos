- Subtitles - Lu?s Filipe Bernardes Nora. Nora. - Hello, Tony. - Hello, darling. You told me you weren't coming tonight. I wasn't. I had to work awfully late at the office. I'm on my way to meet Mother and Father at the theater. But I simply couldn't pass your house without dropping in for a minute. I was just going to turn in for a good night's sleep. - Why, it isn't eight o'clock yet. - I know. But just think what time it was this morning when you let me go to bed. Darling, I have a present for you. Allow me to present Miss Columbine. Like her? Thanks, Tony. Aren't you glad to see me? Of course. But I wasn't prepared. Five minutes later and I would have had coffee by myself. As if I'd care. - Say, you're not angry with me, are you? - Angry? Yes, at running in like this. Don't be silly. But... - But what? - But you do get such funny ideas. Darling... Darling, I want you to marry me. - You must marry me. - Don't be so absurd, Tony. - Why, you know your father. - I'll win Dad over. All that matters in the world is our love for each other. If only you knew how unhappy I am when I'm away from you. Hello? Who is this? Oh. Certainly not. Not a penny. Not a penny, I tell you. Well, it won't get you anywhere. I absolutely refuse to see you. No. No, he's not. - Impudent! - Who was that? Just a beastly tradesman trying to collect a bill. - Father gave me a check this morning. - I don't want it. Oh, please now, he's done it for ?25, I want you to have it. There, it's made out to cash, I don't need to endorse it. - Here. - Very well. Oh, darling... Darling I do want you so terribly for my wife. After all, when I come here with you, it's as though we were married, but... - There's someone in the bedroom. - No, Tony. - But there is! - Tony! Stay there, sweetheart, I'll see. Tony! Who are you? What are you doing with that purse? Pardon me, I thought this was my flat. Your flat? - You're drunk. - Unfortunately no such luck. - Who are you? - My name is Carl Blake. If that means anything to you. Nora, do you know this man? ( defective audio ) Tony, wait! - What are you going to do? - I'm going to telephone the police. Don't do that, don't bring the police into this! - Why not? - Put that phone down! Nora, you... know something about this man. Who is he? The answer is obvious, Mr. Anthony Howard. - How do you know my name? - Shut up! Well, my dear, you can hardly blame me. Why, you told me just now on the phone that... ...Mr. Howard wasn't going to be here. Nora, you do know him. Yes. He's my husband. Now are you satisfied? Yes. The gentleman can't object to me visiting my wife. - How would you like to go to... - Ah! Anywhere with you, my dear. - And I've been fooled. - You most decidedly have. Get out! - After all, it's my wife. - And this is my flat! - Get out! - Well, well, well. All right. As you ask me so politely, of course I'll leave. Good night, darling. Good night, Mr. Howard. I must confess I don't like to leave you two together. But I have a most remarkable nature. Good night. Well, what are you going to do about it? I don't know. I don't know what to do. Now listen, this had to happen some time and it might as well be now. Personally I'm fed up! Fed up with you, fed up with your rotten little checks. Yes, that's what I think of them! All these months you've been lying to me. Oh, turn it off. Yes, I mean it. At first I thought you were just like the others. In wanting one thing, and would pay what you could for it. And then when I realized that you wanted to marry me, ha! I could have screamed with laughter. Me marry you, you poor little fool. - And I've loved you. - Oh, cut it out. Do you think I like being mauled about by you? - Mauled about? - Yes, and it wasn't worth it, my boy. Every bit of love I had for you is gone. Love, is that what you call it? I hate you as much as I love you. I do. I feel as if I could... kill you. Kill me? You haven't even got the nerve. - I haven't? - No! You couldn't kill anyone you could love. - Couldn't I? - No. Let go... you're hurting me. I don't care, I want to hurt you. Let... go! I like hurting you I can't breathe. Can't breathe, eh, that's funny. Do you realize I've only to keep my hands like that a little longer and I've done it? You see, I've only got to keep my fingers tight like that just a few moments longer... What did you say, I haven't got the nerve? I couldn't kill you any more than I could love? I could have killed you. Now that you realize that... No... Nora. Nora... get up, I... I don't think I knew what I was doing. Nora. - Hello, Tony. - Oh, hello, Sylvia. Won't you come in? I know it's late but I just had to stop a moment. - Where are your people? - Well, they went to the theater, I think. - Let me help you. - Thank you. I've just received a nice letter from Dad from Calcutta. I thought you and your father might like to read it. Oh, thanks. Tony, is there anything the matter? No, nothing. You seem sort of upset. Oh, no, really. Have a cigarette. No, thanks. Tony, I particularly wanted to see you tonight. Please tell me what has happened and made you hate me so. Hate you? Don't be silly, Sylvia. I'm not silly, my dear. Only it hurts. You've completely cut me out for the last six months. Sylvia, I'm sorry, I... I'm awfully sorry, I never meant to hurt you. I've been a beast, I'm no good! I just want you to forgive and forget me, do you understand? - Just forget me! - Tony, dear, what is the trouble? I can't tell you, I can't tell you! Tony, your parents, pull yourself together! - Sylvia, darling! - Hello, Lady Howard. Hello, Tony, dear. Did you forget about tonight? No, Mother, I'm sorry, I couldn't get to the theater. Oh! - Been here long? - Oh, no, just a few minutes. - Good evening, Sir Austin. - Sylvia, dear, how are you? - Splendid, thank you. - That's right. Well, young man, I hope you realize you spoiled your mother's entire evening. I'm sorry, Dad, I... You know how nervous she always is about you. She thought you'd been in some accident or other. Well, Austin, as long as he's safe, it really doesn't matter. - I suppose not, my dear. - Only it's a pity you missed the play, Tony. Yes, it was a darn good play. What became of you tonight, Tony? Oh, um... well, I... I dropped down to the automobile club... Do you still have room for our tour to Scotland next week? - Yes! - Good, good! By Jove, I'm looking forward to that tour. We can take Sylvia with us, have a grand time. Did you get any information about the road conditions, Tony? No... I'm sorry, I couldn't get that, Dad. Couldn't get it, why not? Well, I sort of felt faint at the club and I went to lie down. You've been coming home pretty late these nights, young man. - I've heard you sneak in. - Sorry, Dad. Mother, do you mind if I go to bed now? - Of course not, dear. - Good night, dear. Tony, you're not ill? No, Mother, I'm only tired. - Good night, Dad. - Just a second, Tony. Anything wrong, old boy? No, no, I... Come on, what is it, tell me, tell me, what is it, eh? Don't answer that, it's the police, they want me! Police? Want you, what for? - I killed someone. - Killed? - Who? - A girl. - Killed a girl? - I didn't mean to. - What girl? - You don't know her. - What's her name? - Nora Selmer. What do you mean you killed Nora Selmer? I tell you I didn't mean to, I didn't know what I was doing. How... how did you kill her? With my hands, I... I choked her. Oh! What... what time was this? About 8 o'clock. What had she done to you, boy? I was frantic, I tell you, I didn't know what I was doing. I was out of my mind, I suppose. Dear, it can't be true, it can't be true! Come, come, drink this. Now try to remember, Tony. Did anyone see you leave the flat? - I don't think so. - No policemen? No, I didn't notice, I just ran. Now, did you close the door of the flat when you left? - I think so. - Are you sure? Yes, yes, I'm sure, I remember I closed it after me. What time did you get here? Just before Sylvia called. Did any of the servants see you come in? No, they'd gone to bed. I'm so afraid, what can we do? - Now wait, darling. - We must get him away. Yes, wait now, if no one say Anthony leave the flat, there is a chance. - But... - But he killed her, he can't run away. I'm not going to run away, I'm not going to. I'm going to give myself up. You won't do that, you'll do as I tell you. Sit down now! Do you think we're going to let you be hanged because of this fit of madness of yours? - I don't believe... - Your mother and I are responsible for this. We've pampered you all of your life. I knew for some time that something of this sort had been going on. And I had tried in a measure to check it, but... Seems I was too late. - Father, you must... - Do as I tell you, son! Austin. Now, all of you do exactly as I tell you. Now, Mary, - Go upstairs to bed. - Yes, dear. Tony and Sylvia, go upstairs to the library. - Yes, Sir Austin. - No... no, Father... Do as I tell you, son! Now remember, Tony. You were with us at the theater tonight. Do you understand that, Mary? Tony was with us at the Princess Theater. Yes. Tony! The ticket. The ticket I gave you this morning. All right, Now, upstairs all of you. All of you. Are you Sir Austin Howard? - Why, yes. - I'm Inspector Robbins from Scotland Yard. I want to see you. Oh, yes, Inspector. Won't you come in? Thanks. I'm sorry to have kept you waiting, but the servants have gone to bed. Sir Austin, I'm making inquiries in regard to a very serious matter. - Yes, Inspector. Won't you sit down? - Thanks. - Will you have a drink? - No, thanks. Is that your wallet? Yes. When did you last have this wallet in your possession? Well, I haven't seen that wallet now for over... two months. You haven't seen it, why? Well, because I... for the obvious reason that I lost it. You mean you lost this wallet over two months ago? Yes. But, um... sure you won't have a whisky and soda? No, thanks, I don't drink. - Well forgive me if I have one, will you? - Yes, go ahead. Thank you. Inspector, I assume you haven't come all this way at this time of night... ...merely to return a lost pocketbook. Quite correct, Sir Austin, a murder was committed tonight... ...in a flat in Bloomsbury. - Murder? - And this wallet was found near the body. My wallet was found near... - Look here, Inspector, are you suggesting... - I am suggesting nothing, Sir Austin. But I must warn you that anything you may say may be used in evidence. I may say? I may say? - You are warning me? - Yes. Oh, come, come, come, I think you'd better have a drink. No, thanks. Are you willing to answer a few questions? Or must I ask you to come with me to Scotland Yard. Oh, this is preposterous, of course. But what is it you want to know? Well, will you, er... will you have a cigarette? No, thanks, I don't smoke. Is this a piece of check drawn by you? Yes, that's, er... my signature. - Now, this check was found in the... - Oh, of course, I remember now. That check was in my wallet when I lost it two months ago. - Are you sure of that? - Well... I think so. - You only think so? - No, I'm quite sure. Quite sure. Sir Austin, where have you been tonight? - To the theater. - What theater? The Princess Theater. - What... what is this, Inspector, a joke? - I'm afraid not. Will you tell me who was with you at the theater? My wife, and my son. - Where is your wife now? - Lady Howard has retired. I see. Well, I should like to have a word with your wife and son. - Here. - Now look here, Inspector. I refuse to have my family intimidated! The alternative, Sir Austin, will be for you all to go with me to Scotland Yard. Very well, I'll... I'll get Lady Howard. I'd rather you call her from the door, if you don't mind. Oh... all right. Er... Mary! Would you come downstairs a moment, please? Of course, dear. And your son. My son? Oh... of course. No, wait. I'll see him later if necessary. Alone. Oh, Mary. This is Inspector Robbins from Scotland Yard. He refuses to believe... There's no need to tell your wife what to say, Sir Austin. Why, I have no intention of telling her what to say. Then leave the talking to me, please. Oh... all right. Lady Howard, I must apologize for getting you from your bedroom. - Oh, that's quite all right. - I want you to answer one or two questions. - Yes? - Where have you been tonight? - To the theater. - What theater? - I've already told him, dear, that the three of us... Please! Well, Lady Howard? The Princess Theater. Will you tell me who was with you at the theater? - My husband and Tony. - Tony, who's Tony? My son. But Austin, I don't understand. Darling, this is all about a pocketbook of mine that was lost two months ago. You remember. It was found by someone connected with a murder. - Murder? - The police are trying to associate me with... ...murdering a woman. How did you know it was a woman, Sir Austin? Well, that's what I understood you to say. I didn't use the word "woman". Oh... really? Well. I suppose one jumps to conclusions. Sir Austin Howard, I must place you under arrest. Arrest? On what grounds? On suspicion of being the murderer of a woman by the name of Nora Selmer. - Ridiculous, I never heard of... - Austin, Austin, it's not true. Of course it isn't, sweetheart, of course it isn't. - Father, I... - Tony, I'm going down to Scotland Yard. - Scotland Yard? - Yes, they want to ask me a few questions... ...about the murder of some poor woman in Bloomsbury tonight, I... I don't know what it all means. - Yes, but Father... - There's nothing to get excited about! It's all perfectly ridiculous, you... understand? - I know but... - They can't accuse me of this murder... ...any more than they could you. - Mother, I'm going with him! - No, no, you stay here with your mother! - Father, I told you... - Fetch my pipe, there's a good boy. - Goodbye, sweetheart. - Come along, Sir Austin. All right, Inspector, all right. - Oh, Austin, please... - Don't worry, don't worry, I... I shan't be long. We'll soon clear up this... this comic business. Thank you dear... would you? I know Col. Grayson and all of them down in Scotland Yard... ...and they'll... they'll laugh at this thing. Oh, thanks, old boy. Thank you, Mary. Oh, Inspector, did you... did you ever try this mixture? It's created from an extra del... Oh, my word, I forgot you don't smoke. And you don't drink. Dear, dear. What do you do? And you are positive that this man, the prisoner in the dock, is the same man that you saw at the flat of Nora Selmer? Yes, sir. Thank you. Your Lordship and members of the jury. My learned friend, the counsel for the prosecution, has set out to prove many things, and has in fact proved many things. Members of the jury, you may be satisfied... that he has proved that the prisoner... ...was acquainted with Nora Selmer, the dead woman. In fact, as his cousel, I admit, though deeply respected and admired in the community, the prisoner was apparently providing for this poor unfortunate creature... who, with her husband, served some time in prison. But, I submit that the prosecution... ...has not proved the one vital and all important point, that the prisoner was at the dead woman's flat on the night of the murder. The police doctor stated very definitely... ...that the woman had been dead about one hour. We can therefore assume that Nora Selmer... ...met her death between eight and nine-twenty p.m. Where was the prisoner between the hours of eight and nine-twenty... ...on that particular night? Members of the jury, I am going to prove an absolute alibi. I am going to prove... that the prisoner went by taxi with his wife... ...to a certain theater on the night of April 8th, and was there met by his son. Call Henry Hammer. Henry Hammer. Henry Hammer. - Do you swear by Almighty God... - I swear by the Almighty God... the evidence I shall give this court shall be the truth, the whole truth... ...and nothing but the truth so help me God. Kiss the book. Is your name Henry Hammer? Yes, sir, Henry Hammer. Speak up, my man! Yes, sir, Henry Hammer. - Are you a taxi driver? - One of the best. Were you stationery on a rank at Finchley on the night of April 8th? Was I what? Was your cab standing on the rank at Finchley on the night of April 8th? Yes, sir. Did you as a result of a conversation over the telephone... ...go to 118 Hendon Lane at about 7:15 on that particular night? - No, sir. - Speak up, please. Yes, sir. No, sir. Did you pick up a pair at 118 Hendon Lane in the night in question? - Yes, sir. - Was it about 7:15? Yes, sir. Well, why did you say no... ...when I put two questions to you in one? Because you said I held conversation on the phone. Well, didn't you get the call by telephone? No, sir. Well, how then did you know a taxi was wanted? Because there's a bloke in the shelter... ...what answers the telephone and he tipped me off that a taxi had been phoned for. I see. You were very precise, Mr. Hammer. Yes, sir. How many people did you pick up? - Two. - Were they a lady and a gentleman? Yes, sir. I suppose so. Could you identify the gentleman if you saw him? - Yes, sir. - How? How do you mean "how"? Well, I mean, how do you think you can remember what he looks like after three months? Because he was the living spit of my brother Herbert. I see. Well, can you point him out in court now? Yes, sir. Blimey, if he don't look twenty years older since I last seen him. Well, Mr. Hammer, having picked up your fare... I think that is the precise term, It's quite correct, sir. Where did you take them? To the Princess's Theater. And what time did you arrive at the "Princess" Theater? I can't say. - Well, about what time? - Well, before eight, for sure. Why do you say for sure? Because I picked up another fare a few minutes afterwards... ...who said he had an appointment at the Cock Tavern with a lady at 8 o'clock. Well, in that case you must have arrived at the Princess Theater shortly after 7:45. Why? - Well, my good man, if you'll only... - All right, Sir John. You needn't elucidate any further. As Your Lordship pleases. Mr. Hammer. Mr. Hammer! - Aye? - Kindly answer Counsel's questions. - Yes, sir. - And don't stare at me. Yes, sir. You took the prisoner to the Princess Theater and got him there at 7:45... ...on the night of April 8th. - Yes, sir. - Thank you. Thank you, sir. One moment, please. Mr. Hammer, when you pointed out the prisoner as being the living spit, I think that is the term you used, of your brother... your brother... - Herbert. - Herbert. Thank you. You said, here are your exact words, - "But blimey... - Did I say that, sir? - You did. - Oh, blimey. "But blimey if he don't look twenty years older." - Yes, sir. - Might you not have said twenty-five? I might, but I ain't. You ain't? Ain't what? I ain't gonna say twenty-five. Mr. Hammer, how old was your brother Herbert... ...when he impressed this vivid picture on your mind? I don't know what you mean. - Is your brother Herbert dead? - Quite. What do you mean "quite"? He means, Mr. Drinton, that his brother is quite dead. Thank you, Milord, thank you. How old was your brother Herbert when he died? Well, er... we don't know rightly. You see, um... before my mother got married... Yes, yes, yes, yes, but how old was he presumed to be? Thirty-five, roughly. Now, Mr. Hammer, if I were to suggest to you that the man that you drove to the Princess Theater... - was not the prisoner... - What? I mean, is it not possible that you could have mistaken the father for the son? Oh, shut up! Silence in court! Silence in court! If there is any more laughter at this witness's impertinence, I will clear the court! Kindly answer Counsel's questions... ...in a manner befitting the seriousness of the occasion. - Yes, sir. - You ought to be ashamed of yourself. I am, sir. Now, Mr. Hammer, I want to be quite certain of the exact time... ...that you left the prisoner at the Princess Theater. Please tell me. Oh, Blimey, we gotta go all through that again? - Answer Counsel's question. - Yes. I left Finchley at 7:15. And what time did you arrive at Princess Theater? - Quarter to eight. - Are you quite sure of the exact time? - Well, it might have been ten-to. - It might have even been twenty-to. - It might. - Thank you. Thank you. One moment, please. Mr. Hammer, you are quite positive... that the prisoner is the man you deposited... ...at the Princess Theater on the night of April 8th at 7:45? - Yes, sir. - Thank you. One moment, please. Stop playing with your hat! - Have you seen the prisoner since that night? - No, sir. Very well, you may go. I want to call the prisoner now, Milord. - Sir Austin Howard. - Very good, Sir John. Good luck, sir. Do you swear by the Almighty God that the evidence you shall give the court... ...shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God? I do. - Is your name Austin Howard? - Yes. - Do you live at 118, Hendon Lane, Finchley? - Yes. Please hand exhibit three to the witness. Sir Austin, is that your wallet? Yes. Did you tell the inspector at the time of your arrest... ...that you'd lost the wallet two months previously? - Yes. - Was that statement true? No. Will you tell His Lordship and members of the jury why you made that statement then? Because I was afraid if I had admitted giving it to Nora Selmer, my wife might get to know of my association with her. When did you give it to her? About six months ago. It happened jokingly. There was some money in it. I'm afraid I... I'd been drinking a little at the time. Yes, go on. I took the wallet from the floor saying something quite ridiculous about... ...laying my heart and my wealth at her feet. All right. Exhibit 4, please. You are holding part of a check. - Is that your signature, Sir Austin? - Yes. Did you tell the inspector that that check was in the wallet when you lost it? Yes. - Was that true? - No. Well, Sir Austin, why didn't you tell the truth then? For the same reason that I withheld the facts about the wallet. You mean that you didn't wish your wife to know of your association with Nora Selmer. That is so. Now, Sir Austin, will you tell us the truth about the check? It was made out for ?25, payable to cash. I sent it to her through the post the day before her death. Exhibit 5, please. - Is that you private visiting card? - Yes. You heard it had been found in the dead woman's flat on the night of the murder? - Yes. - How do you account for its presence there? Well, I must have left it there in one of my visits. Well, might it not have been in that wallet of yours... ...when you gave it to her six months previously? - Pretty probably. - Well couldn't you say for certain... ...that it was? - I think it must have been. - All right. I'm finished with the visiting card. Now, Sir Austin, tell me, where were you between the hours of 8 and 11 o'clock on the night of April 8th? - The Princess Theater. - Who were you with? My wife and my son. Did you see the performance from beginning to end? I did. And you never left the theater. I did not. When you arrived home shortly before midnight, what did you do? Well, I was about to retire when... ...the officer from Scotland Yard arrived. Thank you. Sir Austin, there are one or two questions I would like to put to you. Yes, Milord? - What kind of hat... ...were you wearing on the night in question? - A light felt one. - Were you wearing an overcoat? Yes, a gray one. Do you realize, Sir Austin, that the hall porter of the block of flats in which Nora Selmer lived... has described almost similar garments... ...as being worn by the man he saw entering the house on the night of the murder? - Milord, I object! - I'm sorry, Sir John, but I'm going to see that justice is done. Yes, I know, Milord, but with the deepest respect... I don't wish to hear any more, you know your remedy. I do, Milord, but the jury! You need not say any more. As Your Lordship pleases. Now, Sir Austin, you have just admitted that you lied to Inspector Robbins. ...so that Lady Howard would not learn of your association with Nora Selmer. - Yes. - Do you expect His Lordship... and the members of the jury... to believe that you would lie to an Inspector of Scotland Yard... ...for so trivial a reason? My married life was not... trivial to me. Your married life. And yet you were living with Nora Selmer. My wife didn't know. I suggest, Sir Austin, the reason you lied to the inspector... - was because you could not tell the truth. - No! I suggest that had you had told the truth, it would be merely an admission of truth. - No! - I suggest that you're not telling... - the truth about that check now. - I am! I suggest that the reason you gave Nora Selmer a check... was not because you were not at her flat... ...but because you did not have the cash on you. - That's not true! - I'm suggesting that it is. - No" - Then why did you send her a check... ...written out for cash through the post? I don't know. The jury will form their own conclusion. Now, Sir Austin, where were you when, in a drunken stupor, you flung your wallet at the feet of Nora Selmer? At her flat, three months before her death. I suggest that it's nothing of the kind. That in your agitation before or after you strangled the woman, you dropped the wallet where it was found by the police. No, because I was not in her flat on the night of her death. The whole point of my case rests upon the fact that you were at her flat! You are in the prisoner's dock now... ...because the police have proved that you were in her flat. - Milord, I object! - Mr. Drinton. Your statement is not quite accurate. You should have said "are endeavoring to prove". I stand corrected, Milord. Hand exhibit 5 to the witness. That is the visiting card found in her flat the night of the murder, you admit that it's yours. - Yes. - Where was it engraved? Smithson's, in Regent Street. Now, Sir Austin, you've just heard their manager testify... that a 1,000 new visiting cards were delivered to you on April 7th... ...about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, do you admit that's true? - That is so. - Is that one of the new cards? - Well, it, er... may be. - Why can't you say yes or no? I'm not sure. You're not sure? You can't tell if it's one of the new visiting cards? - As I say, it may be. - Is it, is it? Yes, yes, it is! And you did not present that card until 4 o'clock, April 7th. No. - Did you visit Nora Selmer on April 7th? - No. And yet it has been proved that that card was found... ...at her flat on the night of the murder. How can you explain that? Well, I... I can't explain it. You're not going to tell me that you... ...flung that card at her feet three months before. Well, obviously not. Then you must have left it in her flat the night of the murder, mustn't you? - Mustn't you? - Certainly not, you're talking nonsense! Please don't answer Counsel in that manner! Why do my words strike you as nonsense, Sir Austin? Because a murderer doesn't leave his card behind. - How do you know? Are you a murderer? - I am not! Well, Sir Austin, since visiting cards cannot account for themselves, how did that one get into her flat? - Well, I told you before I can't explain. - You must explain it! Of course, how stupid of me. I remember now. I, um... I sent her some flowers... ...at the same time as I posted her last check. On the afternoon of April 7th. Yes. What have flowers to do with that card? I believe a gentleman has been known to enclose their cards with... ...flowers? Oh! So you sent her flowers. Yes. Where did you buy them? Oh... Covent Garden market. What time of the day did you buy those flowers? - About five in the afternoon. - Doesn't Covent Garden close at four? Well, it may have been earlier. - Earlier than four? - Yes. But you say you did not possess that card until four. I can't remember the exact hour! Do you realize, Sir Austin, that the question of life or death may sometimes hang... ...upon the exactness of an hour? You're all mad! Father... Milord, my son is not well. I'm sorry for you, but I think your son should leave the court. Milord, I'm being tried for my life! I beg of you to let my son remain. Very well. He may stay if he can control his feelings... ...and not interrupt the proceedings of the court. - Thank you, Milord. - Mr. Drinton, proceed. You don't remember the exact hour. Well, Sir Austin, can you still remember... ...the exact name of the theater you went to on the night of the murder? Yes, the Princess Theater. Now, Sir Austin, in regard to the three theater tickets you used that night, can you still remember where you purchased them? - Savoy Hotel. - Precisely. Here is their voucher indicating that you bought seats 10, 11 and 12... ...of row D, is that correct? - That is so. - Offer it as evidence. Exhibit 8. Here is a clear plan showing the seating arrangement of the Princess Theater. Sir Austin, will you kindly look at row D. Do you notice seats 10, 11 and 12? - Yes. - Which of those three seats did you occupy? - Was it the aisle seat number 10? - No. - Who sat in number 10? - My wife. Did you sit next to your wife? - No. - Then your son sat in number 11. - Yes. - In that case you occupied number 12. - Well... I suppose so. - Why do you say "I suppose so"? I can't remember the number. But if your wife and son sat in 10 and 11, that leaves only 12 for you. - Yes. - I've finished with the witness. Now, Sir Austin did you see an attendant mark off a plan when handed him your tickets upon entering? No. Perhaps you didn't know that such a record of all persons... ...entering at halls of a London theater is made and kept? N... no. This is what is known as a marking-off plan... ...for the Princess Theater for the performance of April 8th. - Milord, I object. - Mr. Drinton! I suppose you're prepared to prove these documents. Yes, Milord, later, with Your Lordship's permission. Sir John? Oh, very well. Can you see certain pencil-crossings through the numbers on that sheet? - Y-yes. - Look at row D. Which numbers are crossed out in pencil? Um... 3,4,5,6,7,8,9... 10, 11... - 13,14... - Number 12 is left off, is it not? - Yes. - But you say that you occupied number 12. I don't know anything about these things. All I know is I was in the theater that night. Well, can you offer any explanation for the absence of the marking-off of number 12? Well, the man's only human, it's very possible he made a mistake... ...and forgot to mark it off. Exactly. I expected you to say that. But it may surprise you, Sir Austin, as it may equally surprise the members of the jury, to learn that even that marking-off sheet does not exhaust... ...the records of attendance to a London theater. Thank you. Have a look at those tickets, Sir Austin. Milord, members of the jury. That bundle contains all the sold tickets handed to the attendant on April 8th. Now, Sir Austin, take numbers D10 and 11 from that bundle. Are those numbers D10 and 11? Y-yes. Now, find D12. - Would you please... - Look for it, please! Look for D12. You can't find it? I'm asking you whether you can find it. - No. - You can't find it because it isn't there. And it isn't there because it was never used. - That's not true! - You have lied in the witness box! - No! - You did not use the third seat. - I did! - You used number 10 and 11... ...and they were occupied by your wife and son? - Yes. I suggest that now we have the truth. You did buy three tickets, you did go to the theater with your wife and son. - Yes. - But is it not true that you left from there... ...and went to the flat of Nora Selmer? That's not true. Oh, why can't you see that you're all wrong? Because I'm not! It's quite clear that your wife and son were at the theater... - ...and you were not. - I was, I tell you! I was in the theater that night! Then how is it that only two of your tickets were used? You keep on asking me the same thing, I tell you I don't know! How many more times must I tell you I was in the theater that night? - And yet you did not use seat number 12. - It must have been some other seat. But you told us you sat on that particular seat! It wasn't true! I sat next to my wife! Then where did your son sit? I don't know... I don't know what I'm saying. You're giving evidence under oath... You're trying to make me say I wasn't in the theater that night! I was at the theater, I won't say it! I was in the theater that night! You've said enough to convince any sane man that you've been lying in the witness box. I'm telling the truth, I sat next to my wife! Then where did your son sit? Release that man! You can't convict that man! He didn't do it, it wasn't him! I saw it! Let me by, let me by! Let me by, I tell you. I want to tell you who did it! - Order in court! - Don't let him do it! Don't let him! - Remove that man! - It wasn't him, it wasn't him, I tell you! I can't do this any longer. I'll say anything you like, I'll say anything you like! What are you going to say, Sir Austin? I'll say anything you like! I'll say I killed her! I killed her! I did it! I did it! I did it! I did it! Well are you prepared to sign this, Mr. Ward? Yes, sir. Does it accurately embody what you of your own free will have just confessed? Does it what "body", sir? - Does it accurately contain statements... - Oh, yes, sir, that's the truth. And you're quite sure the young man's name was Anthony Howard. Yes, sir. Well, why didn't you tell us about this three months ago... ...instead of interrupting the trial this morning? Well, governor, what would you have done in me place? I was afraid you might pinch me for the crime. Well, if you've been telling the truth here, you'll be treated with leniency. Thank you, sir. That is, of course, unless we find that you've committed murder or something like that. Murder, sir? I never did anything like that. - I'm a man of peace. - A peaceful forger. Huh? I never forged anything, sir. But you confessed that you were ready to do so. I'll never do it again, sir, so help me. It don't pay. It don't, Mr. Ward. Here, sign this. I don't like doing this, sir. - It's like signing a death warrant. - Come, come, Ward! Oh, I've talked too much. I've got an awful thirst. Well, Mr. Ward, I think you've earned yourself a drink. - Are the pubs open yet? - Not for half an hour yet. Sergeant, have Mr. Ward stand by in case we need him. See that he's made comfortable. - And get him a drink. - Oh, thank you! Of water! Oh, I've let meself into something alright. Ward's story is fantastic, but I'm inclined to believe him. - What's his record? - Three months for petty larceny, 1928. More fingerprints, Colonel. This is positive proof that he was in the flat on the night of the murder. Hm, looks rather messy to me, Gordon. But I'll take your word for it. Oh, ask the warden to bring in Sir Austin, will you? Yes, sir. Located young Howard yet? Not a trace of him. But he won't get far. Colonel Grayson, what's happened? - What did that man say? - You mean Ward, Sir Arthur? - Yes, Ward, Ward! - Have you ever seen him before? Why... no. - But did he say who committed the crime? - He went further. He stated that he heard and saw it committed. Whom has he accused, please tell me that. - Not you, Sir Austin. - But I tell you he's wrong, Colonel. Because I did it. I've always thought so, Sir Austin. Yes, and you're right. I've been lying all the time in court to save my wife and my son. Now, you heard the Crown prove that I was not at the theater that night. I tell you I went to that woman's flat... ...and I killed her! One moment, Sir Austin. Hello? Hello! Oh, yes, certainly. Send them right in. Sir Austin, your son is here. - My son? - I must ask you to wait in the next room. I refuse to leave this room as long as he's here. If Tony's come here with any fantastic statement, I'm entitled to hear what it is. If you care to remain, you may do so. But if you'll take my advice, you will let me deal with him. - Colonel Grayson! - Tony! Sylvia, why didn't you keep him away? He wanted to come, Sir Arthur, it's only right that he should. Father, you won't keep me away another minute. I think I ought to warn you that since my arrest, my boy has not been himself. - Are you Anthony Howard? - I am. You wish to make a statement of your own free will? - I do. - I know what it is, Colonel. He's obsessed with the idea that he killed Nora Selmer. It isn't true! Colonel, my father is trying to save me. He's trying to shield me now. I killed Nora Selmer! Here's my confession. Father, I don't know what to say to you. That's all right. It's all right, old boy. Where's... where's your mother, hm? I don't know, Dad, I... I had to run away from her. She tried to stop me from doing this. Mr. Howard. I see you say here... as you let go of your victim's throat... ...she fell in front of the couch. - Are you quite sure of that? - Yes. Now let me get this clear. Suppose this chair to be the couch. You say you left her lying dead on the floor in front of it. - Yes, that's right. - How did you strangle her? What? How did you do it? - Colonel, this is too ghastly. - Please, this is really important. - What do you want me to do? - I want you to show me how you did it. Like... I can't... Where's all this leading us, Colonel? They boy's hysterical, he'd say anything. Why, he's never even been to her apartment. - Father! - Surely you must realize... ...the effect the last few weeks have had upon him. Sit here, Mr. Ward. - Yes, sir. - Sir Austin, will you sit there? Now Ward, without regard the feelings of anyone in this room, you'll repeat the story you dictated to me. Colonel, are you asking me to sit here and hear my own son... Sir Austin, will you allow me to conduct this investigation as I see fit? But Colonel, you must realize that... - Please sit down! Oh... Very well. I have very definite reasons for this... little gathering. Come in. - That's her husband! - Sit down, Ward. - What did you say? - That's Nora's husband. I beg your pardon, may I ask who this excitable young person is? Have you never seen him before? I've never seen him in all my life. Well, Mr. Blake, I'm very glad we've finally located you. - Thank you. - As the husband of the late Nora Selmer, you may be of great help to us. - I hope so. - Over here, Blake. Oh, thank you, thank you. Robbins, relieve Mr. Blake of his hat and stick. Oh, that's quite all right, thank you. Now, Mr. Ward, when did you first meet Nora Selmer? - About seven months ago, sir. - In what capacity? We'd been friendly. You mean you were lovers? I used to visit her, sir. How often? Very often. What did you do on the night of her death? Well, she telephoned me that afternoon, sir, to come over and see her. Did you go and see her? - Yes, sir. - For what purpose? Well, every time we was together, sir, there was what you might call a... ...canoodling. Canoodling? Yes, making love. Oh... yes, but, um... Was love-making the only object of your visiting her? - No, sir. - Well, go on. Well, sir, she was planning a forgery as you might say, sir. And I'm pretty handy with a pen. And all that afternoon she had me copying her signature forty or fifty times... ...to see how good I was. Oh, great, great! That one is perfect, simply perfect. I'd swear it was my signature. Oh, you've got it. You've got it, you old rascal. Oh, Ducky! Ducky, do I get my reward? Now listen, in a few days, maybe tomorrow... ...I can have the signature that I want you to copy. Eh? And I want you to practice it until you get it just as perfect as this. Hm, who's signature is it? Never mind. - But he has got plenty of money. - What's the scheme? - Blackmail? - Oh, nothing to bother. - Well, what then? - You're going to write a check. Me write a check? I haven't got a bank account. It will be on somebody else's account. Good heavens, you don't mean forge a check. Wouldn't you like to forge a check? Oh, Ducky, I'd do anything for you. I thought you would. But how are you going to get hold of the signature? Oh, that's easy. His son is playing up to me, my dear. Oh, you're a sly one. - I'm jealous. - Oh, you needn't be. He's just a kid. You won't let him make love to you. How could I when I have got you? That's what I like to hear you say. Of course I have to put up with a bit of luck. - With me? - With him, silly. But you don't love him. No, I don't love anyone. Not even me? - I like you. - You bet you do! No... don't be so greedy. But this is taking an awful chance. - Why? - Forging a check. Oh... cold feet? Oh, of course not, Ducky. But this is all new to me. It's better than petty larceny, isn't it? Why bring that up? Oh, er... Miss Nora Selmer? - Yes. - My name is Howard. - Howard? - My card. Oh... won't you please come in? Thank you. Could I see you alone for a few minutes? - Well, I suppose it could be arranged. - Thanks. Oh, this is Mr. Ward, my cousin. - Sir Austin Howard. - How do you do? How d'you do? Shall I wait in the bedroom, Ducky? Oh, would you mind, Horace? Why, no. - May I? - Thank you very much. I've been anxious to meet you, Miss Selmer. - Oh, really? - Yes. Why? I think you know my son. - Your son? - My son Anthony. Anthony. Anthony Howard. Oh, yes, I met him! Nice boy. Yes, he is nice, Miss Selmer. Um, won't you sit down? Thank you. How is your son these days? Looking a little paler, don't you think? Paler? Paler than what? Than he should. Than he used to. I mean, um... Late hours and, um... ...lack of sleep. Oh, thank you. - Don't agree with him. - He's keeping late hours? - Very. - Oh. - Too bad. - Yes. I don't want Tony to grow up ignorant of life... ...but I do think he's living far beyond his strength and his means. But why don't you tell him so? Well, I have mentioned it, but I'm... ...rather anxious not to seem the mid-Victorian parent. You don't strike me that way at all, Sir Austin. Well, I'm not your parent, Miss Selmer. But I think you would make a very nice parent. Yes. That is, no doubt meant as a compliment, but, um... Adventure no longer intrigues me. - Nor me, for that matter. - Well, I'm glad of that. You see, there is a charming girl to whom my son is more or less engaged. Oh? And he seems to have gradually drifted away from her. And how does that concern me? Well... cherchez la femme. By a simple process of elimination I selected you as his, um... ...innamorata, shall we say? I trust I'm not mistaken. And do you approve of me? Oh, come, come, come. How could I answer that? Say whatever you like. You won't offend me. Well, if you don't mind my saying so, I do think that Tony... has been a little... precocious... in his choice of a lady friend. I don't exactly know what you mean by that, Sir Austin. Well, I mean... I hope he can live up to you. Personally, young lady, I can't. And I have to put the bills. Are you implyng that Tony is providing for me? Well, er... isn't he? - At least... partially. - Certainly not! He never spent a penny on me. And would you mind leaving my house? - Your house? - Get out! Oh, now, come, come, come, come, we mustn't lose our tempers. - Then don't insult me, please. - Oh, I apologize. - I hope so. - I apologize most profoundly. Both for myself and my son. I'm disappointed in Tony, most disappointed. Paying court to a beautiful lady and... ...never spending a penny on a dear, dear, dear, d-d-d-dear. - I shall have to take it to task. - Oh, forget it. Oh, but I can't I can't, my dear Miss Selmer. Now, won't you let me... remunerate you for the time, the motherly care that you've devoted to him? Let me settle his account... so to speak? Did you by any chance come here to buy me off? - Is that possible? - Certainly not. You see, Sir Austin, your son happens to love me. Yes... How much do you love him? Enough to marry him if necessary. I see. Well, of course, my dear Miss Selmer, I suppose you have enough money tucked away to... ...support the two of you. Certainly! I'll support Tony... ...if you decide to be the mid-Victorian parent and cut him off without a penny. But I'm afraid in that case I should be even early-Victorian. Let me see, you put my hat and stick... - Oh, yes. - Oh, um... Oh, Sir Austin, Miss Selmer? How much do you feel that Tony really owes me? - Nothing. - But, um... it would make you very happy... ...if I made a sacrifice and gave him up? Oh, very. Now what is the sacrificial... price? Five thousand pounds? I think I'm worth at least that. Do you? Well, to be quite frank, my dear Miss Selmer, I think you're worth, um... - One thousand. - Now, now, Sir Austin! - Well... well, at least three. - Now, if it were for myself, Miss Selmer... Yes, yes, but... for my very young son... oh, no! One. - All right. - All right. - S-e-l-m... - E-r. - Hm? - E-r. Oh... thank you. One thousand pounds sterling. It is too bad, Sir Austin, that your son is not you. For more reasons than one. Yes. Possibly three. Thank you. It's a pleasure, Miss Selmer. I should expect you to break with my son immediately. You'll choose your own methods, of course. If you don't, well then... But I feel quite sure that you have a large amount of good common sense. Thank you. That's right. - Thanks. - Oh, um... Do drop in for a cup of tea some time. Oh, yes, and you must come and see us, too. Good afternoon. Just a gigolo, everywhere I g... - Well, Ducky? - I got it. I got it. Strike me pink! A thousand quid from the boy's Papa! And Horace, darling, you're going to make that signature worth a lot more than a thousand pounds. - Won't you? - Oh, Ducky! Now, Mr. Ward, you say you were in the bedroom. ...from the time Sir Austin left until the arrival of his son two hours later. - Yes, sir. - And what were you doing at that time? - Sir? - What were you doing? From 6:15 until 8:00. Beg your pardon, sir. What's the matter, speak up! Oh, canoodling? - Yes, sir. - The whole time? - Yes, sir. - Well, I must say. However, I see you describe here... ...the unexpected arrival of Mr. Blake at his wife's flat. Yes, sir. Er, am I in this now? Yes, this is a general investigation. Sergeant, I'm sure Mr. Blake would like you to relieve him of his hat and stick. Oh, please, don't bother. Now, Mr. Howard, you say you found this gentleman in the bedroom rifling the lady's purse. Yes, sir. - May I ask a question? - Pray do. Thank you. This... this personage... ...has said he was in the bedroom. Well, how could I have entered the bedroom without... this person seeing me? I did see him, sir. I was hiding in the clothes closet. And there was four holes in the panel for ventilation, I seen him plain. Absurd! Why, I hadn't seen Nora for some time. As a matter of fact, we'd broken up. Yes, we know. You even married again about four months ago, didn't you? Yes, I believe so. In that case, Mr. Blake, you admit you're a bigamist. Not at all. Nora's dead body was found on the couch. And that made me a monogamist. But you were a bigamist after the time your wife's body was found on the couch. On the couch? - Colonel, could I... - Certainly. - Tony! - Yes, Father? You said you left the woman's body on the floor in front of the couch. Yes, that's right, Father. - Well then Colonel, how did... - Sir Austin! Mr. Ward has already explained a great deal. Suppose we let Mr. Ward continue his interesting story. Well, a little while after Ducky... I mean Nora, let Mr. Howard in, it sounded as if they was having a bit of a row. And I distinctly heard young Mr. Howard say, "You see, I could have done it, I could have killed you." Ducky. Ducky! Nora! What's happened? He's murdered her! I've got to get out of here. What are you doing down there? What am I doing? I was nearly murdered, that's all. Murdered? - He tried to kill me. - Who? Young Howard? He nearly had me choked to death. Serves you right, associating with a little fool like that. - Mind your own business. - Ordering me out of the house, indeed! I had a good mind to blow his brains out. - Ha! - I could have done it, my dear. - Put that gun away. - Don't worry. It would be silly to shoot you. - I know how to get it in a safer way. - You thief! What did you come back for anyway? I told you on the phone I had to have cash. No use. You won't find a penny. Didn't he, um... give you any tonight? He gave me a check... but I tore it up. - You tore up a check? - Let go! I've taken all the bullying I'm going to from you. Where's that check? In the fireplace. Here is part of it. Where's the other half? - I don't know. - You're lying. If only you knew how idiotic you look hunting around for money. - Stop laughing. - I can't. Stop laughing I say! - Take your hands off me! - Are you going to come across? No, I'm not! Why don't you go to your other woman? What other woman? The one you married the other day. - Who told you that? - Never mind who told me? I know. - You know, eh? - Yes, I know. And I'll just give you just ten-minute start, you dirty swine, before I call the police. - Will you? - Yes, I will! And you'd better hurry. Or you'll be doing a long stretch for bigamy. I'm through with you! Through with people like you! I realized this afternoon that it's just as easy to get the important one. - So you're ditching me, huh? - Yes, and it's too bad, isn't it? Too bad! Too bad the boy didn't do a better job. I'll do it right! All the time I was there behind the curtain, sir. I know I ought to have broke in, but I was afraid. - I haven't slept in peace since! - Mr. Blake, have you anything to say? Certainly not! What could I possibly have to say to a dirty, sniffling, low... - My word, he nearly got me! - We were watching you, Ward. - Take him out. - Sorry I missed! Sir Austin, you behaved splendidly. Oh, no, Colonel. I always felt I was largely responsible. If I hadn't gone to that poor girl behind my boy's back, this thing might never have happened. Father, if only I could have kept you out of this! Tony, old boy. self-sacrifice is one of the greatest luxuries in life... ...for somebody whom you love very deeply. For my dear boy it becomes a positive orgy. Bless your heart. Here, you kiss him. - Subtitles - Lu?s Filipe Bernardes
