That's the age-old thing, I mean, L.A. versus New York. It's just where you want to live. I personally happen to like L.A. -It's another lifestyle, Edgar. -That's very clear. See? You don't see that kind of thing walking around in L.A. -Well, they're all in cars! -Yeah, yeah... How do you like it? -[Edgar] This is it? Wow! -Yeah. He went all out this time. [whistling] [Edgar] It's... down here? Yeah. What the hell is this? A restaurant? Oh, it's French! He did this for the premiere, huh? No, no, it's always like this. Jesus Christ... -Harris... -Harris Sloane? Edgar Kent. Aztec Films. I'll be taking charge of Jean-Fidel. Oh... right. So... we're getting all excited, huh? [scoffs] You don't look very excited. Oh, no. This is very exciting for me. In fact, this is delirious, right, Barney? Oh, Harris is really excited about this whole thing-- Okay, guys, moving right along now. His plane gets in at 4:10, which means I want the limo to pick me up no later than 2:30 'cause I wanna get out there in time to check things out, you know? For dinner, well, I've left it up to you guys. Make it something nice, though, huh? You do have some decent restaurants here, I hope! And then, nothing is scheduled 'till the press conference at one tomorrow, and let's keep it that way, okay? I mean, no friends of friends bugging the guy, okay? And that applies right through Wednesday 'cause... the premiere night, you know, 'cause I want him rested for the rest of the tour, okay? Any questions? Yeah, uh, I've got a question. What limo? The limousine! Uh, we're not budgeted for a limousine. [chuckles] Hey, okay, we'll pick up the limo. So, we wash each other's backs. Aw, that's great, I love that. "Wash each other's backs." Isn't that nice, Barney? Yeah, that's first-rate. And, look, Harris. -You mind if I call you Harris? -No. Look, Harris, it's really important to me personally that this tour go off smoothly, you know? I just want everybody to have a good time! Huh? Youhave a good time. Hmm? Come on, Edgar. I'll show you around. Hey, relax! It's gonna be beautiful, okay? Just let me take care of everything, okay? Relax! Psh! Kind of touchy, isn't he? Well, he hasn't really been himself since he broke up with his girlfriend. [humming] [romantic music] [soft jazz music] [woman] Where did you and Ruthie meet? [Ruthie] Oh, Maddy and I were college cellmates, if you can believe it. That is until I dropped out and she joined... What was it? "Phi Gamma Globulin"? [laughs] [Madeleine] Everybody in the '60s was doing that. -I mean, it was... -[woman] Did you do that? [Ruthie] No! She's so innocent! [Madeleine] I'm not innocent! Maybe I haven't always been where the action is, but I've been... [indistinct chatter] [woman] Madeleine, which do you like better, D.C. or New York? Oh, no, I'm from the state, not the city, I... [laughs] Actually, I'm from Seattle. Yeah, but don't let her country ways fool you. She is hot. [laughter] [woman] You're in New York to become a journalist? Um, no, no... [chuckles] Not really. I mean, if I had my dream, it would be to write novels, but, uh... when Ruthie got me this job at the magazine-- [Ruthie] Oh, please. Really, it was nothing. I merely made the editor an offer he couldn't refuse. [laughter] It's no big deal, believe me. You do not want his number. -[laughter] -[sighs] Um, yeah, well, I also figured that doing interviews and everything would give me kind of an ear for dialogue-- Oh, Mad, there's the guy I've been dying for you to meet. Donny! -Donny Conrad! -See, I really... -I don't wanna meet anybody. -Yes, you do! No, I don't! I'm... I'm hungry, actually. I haven't had anything to eat all day, so... excuse me. Donny! Come here. It's nice to see you. Oh, you're so beautiful! ♪ I'm stepping out, my dear ♪ ♪ To breathe an atmosphere That simply reeks of class ♪ [humming] See, the difficulty isn't talking to strangers. Yes. You know, when you start talking to people nowadays, I don't know... Their guard goes up, and before you know it, it's... Do you think I'm trying to pick you up? [laughs] I'm not, I'm not. I know it might have occurred to you, but I'm not. -You see, I couldn't. -I... -I wish I could, I wish I could. -Oh. No, I, I... I don't mean to sound "I wish I could," I just... It would embarrass me. You know? I don't know why I say that, but... I guess I'm old-fashioned, you know. Yeah, you know. Old-fashioned. I'm straight. -Aw, I, I... -No, no, no... [chuckles] -Not straight as opposed to... -Bent. -Bent! Yeah. -[laughs] Yeah, no, old-fashioned. I'm old-fashioned. You're also eating the salad dressing. Oh, yeah, yeah... Well, what I like to do is, I like to... I eat the salad dressing first, you know, and then... half hour later, what I like to... I like to get the lettuce, you know? And I eat that dry. And then, I just kinda shake it up and mix it up to... specifications. -[laughs] -Want some? -Uh... no. -No? [honking] Am I going on and on? I... -You? -Yeah. Oh, no, no, no. No, it's not you, it's me. Because I feel like you haven't said anything for a long time, -and I thought-- -Oh, no, no. It's just because when I try to impress somebody, I usually get real clever, and I blow it, so... [laughs] Oh, come on! No, honest, you see... God, who has a heart as big as all outdoors, works in very mysterious ways. He makes you meet someone terrific, and then he makes you say something stupid. -You mean, you're saying that-- -[man] Hey, baby! -[kissing noise] -Excuse me for a second. Ah, you were talking to me, weren't you? Look, let me explain something to you. If you were walking along the street with your sister or your mother, and somebody said something like that to them, you'd be very angry, wouldn't you? Of course you would. So the next time when you see a woman walking along the street, why don't you just think of that and just bite your tongue? See, you gotta embarrass them back. Oh, you embarrassed him all right. Yeah, because the next time when a woman's coming along... -[loud banging] -...he'll be a little bit slower to bully her. You see what I mean? -What were we talking about? -[cat yowls] Oh yeah, um... You were saying that you think... ...that you're gonna get killed. You see, this is a very dangerous neighborhood. -It is? -Oh sure. I mean, that man is either a killer or an NYU professor. -You never know around here. -[Madeleine] How do you tell? [phone ringing] Hello? [coughs] Hello? [Harris] Hi. Hi. Who is this? It's Harris. Harris Sloane. [Madeleine Oh, oh... -Hi. -I didn't wake you, did I? What time is it? Ah, it's about... 2:49. In the morning? You're up really early. Is everything okay? [Harris] Oh sure, sure. This isn't too late to call, is it? Oh no, no, I'm... I'm really glad that you did. I wanted to talk to you. So... What are you doing? I was just sleeping. Yeah, that's right. I thought you'd be sleeping. Actually, I just called to see if this was the right number. Oh. Well, that was... That was very thorough of you. You know, 'cause a lot of people might give out one number and it turns out to be another one. You never know. So I just thought check it out. [chuckles] Yeah, no, I'm really glad you did because I just moved in and I could have... could've been the wrong number, only... ...it wasn't. No. [chuckles softly] Okay. So, uh... I'll talk to you later. [laughs] Okay. I'll talk to you later. Goodnight. [chuckles] Goodnight. You schmuck! What a dumb conversation! [sighs] He's really crazy. He's real cute, but boy is he crazy. [laughs softly] So how long were you two together? Full cycle, seven years. -Oh. -Yeah. [chuckles] That's why it's so strange. It's kind of like a delayed adolescence, being on my own. I mean, you know, living by myself, dating, meeting lots of new people. Are you happy now? Ah... Well, yeah. But I'm lonely and I can't stand dating, and meeting new people drives me crazy. Other than that it's great, huh? Yeah. Other than that, it's great. Like meeting me? Yeah. It's over here. But you know, you don't have to. I mean, you can just drop me off here, you don't have to help me. [Harris] No, I don't mind, really. Yeah, but I mean, you don't have to. If you want to, okay. But I mean, I just want to establish at the beginning -you don't have to. -No, I want to help, honest. -[Madeleine] Okay. -I don't mind. -Really? -Really. [bus honking] I don't think I want to do this. -You said you wanted to do this. -I know. You said you really wanted to do this. -Yeah, that was me. -I see. So you're a guy who goes back on his word? Yup. Pretty much. Every opportunity I can. -I see. -All right. Ah, you putz. So, you into bondage? -I'm gonna be too tired. -Okay. You okay? Yeah. [Harris grunts] So, uh... This is the foyer. And, um, here we have the library-den area. And the bedroom right off of the living room, off of the dining room slash kitchen combo where... right off of that is the powder room, you know, bathroom. And here also is a storage area. I like it. -I like it. -Yeah, it's a real step saver. It's charming, really. Yeah? And it's all mine. -Anyway... -I'll put that up. Okay. In spite of everything, my parents always said "The best is yet to come". -Uh-uh. -Yeah. And corny as it may seem, I kinda believe it. -Really? -Yeah. Cross my heart. See, my parents always said "The worst is yet to come. If it hasn't happened yet, it will." [Madeleine] I think I liked it better the other way. [Harris] You're kidding. [both laugh] It looks great. Yeah. We oughta do this again sometime. -I don't think so. -I don't either. [chuckles] I've gotta go. You sure you -don't want to join me? -[murmurs] No, I should stay and clean up. It's an Indian film. -[coughs] -[laughs] -Yeah? -Yeah. It's one of those, ah... those great Indian films. This kind? No, no, no. -This kind of Indian. -Oh. [both] Serious Indian. No, I really have a lot to do. Okay. -Well, it looks great. -Yeah. I like my work. You do good work. -Thank you. -You're welcome. -I'll see you. -Okay. [soft kiss] I'm in big trouble.

Good morning. Madeleine? [Madeleine] Yeah? [Harris] I've got a great idea. In fact, this might be one of the best ideas I've ever had! You ready? Here it comes. Why don't you move in here with me? I like it. -What do you think? -[chuckles] I think you're crazy. It's not a bad idea. I just moved into my own apartment. I know, but we've got this connection. Harris, I don't want to talk about it, okay? You're upset. No, I'm not upset. I just don't want to talk about it. Look, I'm... I'm on a break. I just wanna relax, and this is the way I relax. I read. [inhales and exhales deeply] You read? Well, I wanna read. In fact, there's something I've been meaning to read for such a long time, and I think this is exactly the right moment to do that reading. Gee whiz. Ah, this is great. I should have read this a little earlier. "Nabisco Shredded Wheat. No added sugar. The natural goodness of whole wheat." Ah, this is great! That's very nice. "Good source of bran, fiber..." Ah, that's just great. Oh, this is interesting right here. If, uh, two people like each other, why don't they live together? You know, Madeleine, what I really hate are the silences. They drive me crazy. I hate silences. [sighs] I love silences. You love them? Yeah. You see, when I'm talking, I at least know what one of us is thinking. You see, when none of us is talking, I don't know what you're thinking. I know. Well, I don't understand why you're so upset. All I suggested was that you move in. All I suggested was... I don't wanna talk about it. That doesn't mean it's a bad idea. [stirs cereal] [jazzy music] Hi David. You coming or going? Ha. A little bit of both. You look great. False perm. -Sure, I'm the one who's-- -[knocks on glass] ...but is Harris gonna be there? Well sure we're gonna cover it, Barnes. Jean-Fidel Mileau's a big star. Yeah. No, I just got it this morning, Barney. Yeah, I'm looking at it right now. Yeah. Yeah. All right. [grunts] Sure. -One o'clock tomorrow. -[groans] [spitting] -Yeah. -Ugh! -[spitting] -No, it's all right. -They will have someone there. -Does anybody have any, um... gum, or any...? -[George] Right. Thank you. -Ugh! -[George] Buh-bye. -What is that? Oh, I don't believe you did that to me. -Think of it as a diet drink. -Oh, I don't believe it! -I drank it. -[chuckles] What's this? Um... It's the stuff from this morning. Miss Venezuela Annie has the pictures. -Ugh. -How'd it go? Oh, she's 18, absolutely beautiful. Very poised. Perfect body. And, uh, sweet. She genuinely loves everybody and everything. And I want to punch her right in her big, perfect teeth. I don't understand why you gals like these foreign film stars. You still wanna cover it? -Harris will be there. -It's tomorrow at one, right? Right. I don't want you running off to Paris or anything with that Frenchman. Spent too much time training you. Yes, dad. 'Course it's not fair. But who says anything's supposed to be fair? I mean, I figure, where else can I meet a guy who wouldn't try to rule my life but at a Human Potential workshop, right? Ruthie, look. It's getting better. And you know those sayings, uh... "I've got my space, you've got your space." And I figure, oh good, no worries, no hassles. And I'm having eye contact with this gorgeous guy and I'm thinking, "Haha, if I do my thing and he does his thing, unfortunately, while my thing is a romantic walk along the beach like in the official Human Potential weekend brochure, his thing is sitting at the bar crushing beer cans against his forehead." I'm not happy. Oh, wait, wait. Wait a minute. So I say to him, "Sam," his name is Sam, "Sam, you are a big jerk. You are the biggest jerk that I have ever gone out with." And he says, "Ruthie, I really dig your honesty, but I am not in this world to live up to your expectations." And I say, "Look, Sam. I am not in the mood for a marathon. I'm hungry, I'm having a lousy time, you ask me out for dinner and I end up with a bowl of salted nuts. What am I, a chipmunk?" To which he replies, "You are you and I am I," which is not exactly an answer when you are starving. So I got up and left. The next at the workshop everybody calls mehostile because I'm so judgmental. Me, judgmental. Can you believe that? Do you think I'm judgmental? -Mm-hmm. -Damn straight. It's known as having taste. I don't know, maybe I'll go back to my analyst. I thought of going gay, but when you come right down to it, aren't women really as ridiculous as men? Well, I'm glad I could just drop by here and pour my heart out to you, Ruth. Do I detect a note of sarcasm? Oh, no, no, no, no. No, I'm seeing Harris tomorrow and I'm twisting. A date? [Madeleine] No, a press conference. Romantic. [snorts] [sarcastic] Ha-ha. Look, I'm gonna go shopping, do you wanna come? [Ruthie] Clothing? No, food. I'm gonna eat myself into a stupor. You two are the weirdest couple I have ever seen. [water running] Hey! Your door's unlocked! Barney, you scared me! And you know your phone's dead? You don't have to scare me half to death to tell me that, do you? [Barney] We don't have much time! We've got to pick up Edgar, and we gotta get out to the airport. Why's your phone dead? What's that, Barn? Try to hurry up, Harris, will you? I don't want to keep Jean-Fidel waiting. [Harris] All right, I'm getting dressed as fast as I can. Why don't you go into hiding? Ever since you and Madeleine split up, you've been impossible. Not very adult. Oh, since when are you my grown up? I don't need you to look after me, Barney. I can look after myself. You know, when you run a place of business, Har, or just work with other people, you gotta realize that your moods affect the people around you. What are you doing? Um... Just fixing the phone. [fabric tearing] [Harris] Barney, there's no one here. And you can hardly see it. It's that small, really. [PA] Pan Am flight 145 from Paris now arriving at gate 7. [sighs] Jean-Fidel, can you believe it? This is the most incredible day of my life! I'm sure it is. [Edgar] Shit. Hey, does he speak English? I don't know. You don't know? Hell, no. I can't be expected to know everything. You're an advance man, Edgar, you're expected to know things in advance. Come on, you guys! Don't worry, 'cause I can always translate. I happen to be pretty damn fluent. [chuckles] Oh, God... [Harris] Will you recognize him? [Edgar] Of course. I've seen all his pictures. [Harris] I know, but they look different off screen. -[Edgar] I know! -He's probably taller... [Edgar] They're usually smaller. [Barney] There he is! [Harris] That's him with the sunglasses. -[Edgar] Who? -[Harris] That's the guy. -That's him. -[Edgar] You're right, it is! [man] Thank you. [Harris] Monsieur Mileau? This is Barney Collins -Hi. -I'm Harris Sloane. Hello, nice to meet you. -And I'm Edgar Kent. -Hello. [Edgar] Uh, bonjour, monsieur. Uh... [tries to speak French] Why does he call me a baby tooth? -A baby tooth? -Yes. I don't know. Why did you call him a baby tooth? I... I was just trying to say hello, I... He was just trying to extend greetings. Tell him thank you. He says thank you. Now, listen, is there a phone booth somewhere around here? Over here, monsieur. I must make a call. -Excuse me. -Of course. [PA] Attention, Ms. K. Hopkins, please report to passenger information desk. Isn't he incredible? Oh, yeah. I'll take that, Barney. Who is he calling? Maybe a baby dentist. Ladies and gentlemen, Jean-Fidel. -[excited chatter] -[cameras clicking] Thank you. Hello, New York. Welcome. Excuse me. [overlapping conversations] I don't understand a word of what you're talking about. -Mr. Fidel. -Thank you. -Another close-up, please? -With pleasure. Sorry, no more. -Mr. Fidel... -[Barney] Thank you very much. [beep] [Ruthie] Hey, Maddy. Dinner tonight? Alvin's inviting someone over who I want you to meet. You better call me. [beep] [George] Maddie? Christ, I hate these machines. Uh, about your Miss Venezuela piece, call me. Damn these machines! Get rid of it. And don't forget the Jean-Fidel press conference tomorrow at one. [beep] [Mrs. Ross] Hi, Maddie? This is your mother. Your father and I are going to Disneyland next week. Please call and tell us what rides to go on. Bye! [beep] [low-pitched beep] [phone ringing] [Madeleine] Hello. This is Madeleine Ross. I'm not in right now, but if you'll-- -[Harris] Yes, she is! -Oh, great. I don't believe it. Go take your shower. -Hey, can I try that? -No, you can't. This is my machine. If you wanna try, you go get your own machine. -No, I hate those things. -Well then, don't touch this. Oh, come on! Let me be your guest announcer. [laughing] Please. -All right. -Okay. But you have to promise you won't screw it up, okay? -Screw it up? -Yes. -Moi? -[chuckles] Hm. No chance. -Wait a minute. -Okay. -Are you ready? -Hallo? Hallo? -Yeah. Oh wait. -[chuckles] -Okay? -Mm-hmm. Hello. Madeleine Ross can't come to the phone right now because we're making love. God, you're such a baby. However, if you leave your name and your phone number, we'll get back to you right after we're finished. In 30 seconds. Ooh, nasty. -Very charitable. -No, I'm not finished! -Hey, come on. -Oh, come on. Just one more. I want to erase this because my mother's gonna be-- [laughing] Oh, I can feel your stomach vibrating. That's supposed to be my heartbeat. Oh, you must have a pacemaker. -Hey, Maddy? -Hm. I love you. -Yeah? -Yeah. [sentimental music] I'm... I'm right now actively loving you, can you feel that? -Can you feel me loving you now? -Yeah. I'm not talking infatuation here, -I'm talking-- -Lust. Oh, lust? Is that what I'm talking about? Lust. The big "L". -Me? -Yeah. And since you're talking... talking... Hmm... I feel another vibration. [both giggling] -[phone rings] -Oh, shit! Oh, wow! Oh, no! Hello? [giggling nervously] Yes, hi, mom. [whispering] Go take your shower. What? Nothing. Nothing, nothing. [tsks] Why is it whenever I laugh you think something's wrong? [upbeat music] [Harris] You know, we're missing Spellboundtonight? [Madeleine] It'll be on again. Come on, this'll be fun! Is that, uh... that guy from your office, that David character, is he gonna be there? Probably, why? Does he know that we're seeing each other? I hate parties. No one ever enjoys themselves at parties. They're just... not fun. All you so is sit around and hear a lot of small talk. I'd like to go to a party where you sit around and you have some big talk. Look, I don't make a fuss when we go out to your movies. Because you sleep during my movies. I do not! Only when they're boring. Movies aren't boring. Life is boring. Movies are... real. Let's just call a truce, okay? Great, I'll just go to the party, I'll just sit around, anyone comes up to me, I'll small talk. [Madeleine] Look at this house! It's gorgeous! I don't need a car really, in New York, know what I mean? So if I sold it... well, I figure it'll give me that much more money, a little more independence. You think you have enough there? Yeah. So how much you think I'd get for it, really? It's the psychopaths who are screwing everything up: the city, crime, politics, sports, you name it. You know why? Do you know why? Why? Because they're crazy, that's why. [Madeleine] It's such a cute little car. -[Ruthie] Cute doesn't run good. -Hi. Oh, hi. So you made it. Yeah, I guess I did. -See you later. -Oh, I'm sorry. Gosh. Ruthie Miller, Dave Richie. Oh, God. [tuts] Have you been here before? No, this is my first time really. -It's a fabulous place. -Oh, it's great. -Beautiful. -Can I show you around? Sure, thanks. You know... my wife says that I get very boring when I get drunk. Am I boring you? No. No, no. Then I'm not drunk yet. -[laughs] -That's really funny. I tell you, they're all junkies, believe me. -[Harris] Hey, Ruthie! -Harris, hi! -Hi, how are you doing? -Oh, mwah. -Hi! -What are you doing here? Oh, I'm good friends with Martin. Who's Martin? Maddy's publisher, he's the one giving this shindig. Oh. See, I don't know anyone here at all. What am I, chopped liver? [both laugh] -It's good to see you! -Same here. Hey, where's Madeleine? Would you like to take a little walk? -Me? -Yeah. -Walk? -Yeah. -Sure. -Yeah. The sun's starting to set. Mm. [giggles] What do you want me to say, Harris? Huh? You two are gonna end up riding off into the sunset together? You have to understand where she is coming from. Didn't she tell you about Craig? Yeah. So then you know what kind of a son-of-a-bitch he was. She told me they had a terrific relationship. Terrific? For him. He couldn't commit himself. The closest thing he ever came to giving her an invitation to L.A. was, "Come on out, if you feel like it." -You're kidding? -No. I'm making it up. So, uh... what do you think I should do, Ruthie? [laughs] Harris, I am not talking about you! I'm talking about Madeleine. But, for starters, you could tone it down a little bit. Tone what down? You're a very intense person. -I'm not intense. -You're not intense? You are the most intense person that I have ever known. She has a tough enough time as it is -without some jealous guy-- -Jealous? -I'm not jealous! -You're not jealous? -Uhm-uhm. -Okay. Suppose she decided to go out with that guy, David, tonight. -She wouldn't. -She wouldn't? No, see, you don't realize. I'm very understanding. And I'm sensitive. -Oh. -I'm sensitive. And I'm understanding. What a guy, I envy you. I'm kinda now, you know. I'm kinda seventies. I'm open... -[amused sigh] -Very upfront. And... -I'm a Leo. -And... you're jealous. Well, does "sorta involved" mean sortainvolved or... sorta involved? [giggles] Uh, involved. Uh... sort of. I like your hair. [clicks tongue] Oh, you know, I should cut it, -or perm it or something. -No, no, no. -No, it looks beautiful. -Thank you. Why don't I get us some drinks? Okay? I'll get them, okay? Just stay right here. Don't move. -Okay. -Be right back. Don't move. All right. Hey. -Hi. -[taken aback] Hi. What's the matter? Oh, nothing. Nothing. I just... I figure I owe you an apology. -You know, in the car. -Oh, no. No, no. Really. I-- Is something wrong? No. Well... Are you sure? Yes. well... anyway, what's been going on with us in the car, we got a lot to learn about each other and-- -He returns with good cheer! -Thank you. Hey, we're talking here! -Do you mind? -[glass shatters] Jesus. [Harris humming] Doo, doo, doo... You know, when you come down to it, for a party, it wasn't that bad. [continues humming] Doo, doo, doo, doo... Are you upset about something? Look, Maddy, if you got something on your mind -I wish you'd say it-- -You're a shit. -Coming up? -No. I had a wonderful time. Get your hands off the car. -Thanks for a great evening. -Get your hands off the car. Will you call me tomorrow? Get your hands off the car. She'll probably call tomorrow. Man, I hate parties. Hello? [voicemail] Hello, this is Madeleine Ross. I'm sorry, but I'm not in right now, or else I'm unable to come to the phone. So if you just leave your name, your number, and any message at the sound of the tone, I'll get back to you as soon as possible. Thank you very much. Hello, Maddy? Madeleine, if you're there I wish you'd just say something. I know you're there. Madeleine, please. Just-- If you just talk to me. Look, I'm not gonna have enough time to say anything on this damn machine. I hate machines! If I wanted to talk to a machine I'd call IBM. I've been trying all week to get tickets to the Cuban ballet, it's impossible. I'm into cars. Oh. Oh. They say cars are phallic symbols, which is fine by me because I've got a really fine car.

Somehwere where it's neutral. Okay. -Let's talk. -No, I'm gonna talk to you. You are going to listen. This is going to be a completely unique experience. Would you mind? We're having a private conversation. Yes, I would mind! Do you know what time it is? -You know what time it is? -I don't care what time it is! Look, I'm sorry about all of this, What do you mean, you're sorry? Why are you apologizing to them? Why don't you apologize to me? I didn't mean it to them. I mean it to you. I'm sorry. -All right. -It is 5 o'clock in the morning! -We know that. -That's what time it is. Well great, then why don't you just go to bed? Why don't you go to your own apartment? -I don't want to go! -Go to your own apartment! -Go, go, go! -Hey, get your hands off me! You schmoock! -No, that's "schmuck". -Schmun...? -Schmuck. -Schmuck. I'm sorry, she's from out of state. She meant to say "schmuck", "you schmuck". You're...! You perverts! You can't talk like that in front of my wife! If we're perverts, we can say anything we like. That's the right of perverts. [snickers] [man] You think you're funny? -That was pretty funny. -Mildly amusing. I'm calling the police! The police would never come out at this hour. Yeah, you're a real wise guy. A real wise guy! Here! You're really asking for it! -Back! Back! -Poke him! -Back! Back! -Harris... -It's dangerous. -[woman] Poke him! -Ha! -[Madeleine] Oh! And so, to end the refrain... thrust... ha! [gasps in pain] God! Oh... Ah... I'm sorry about the umbrella. I'm sorry about your leg. I'm much more sorry about my leg than the umbrella. Yeah, I can see why that would be. Maybe you should walk on it a little bit. [gasps] I'll try. It was real dramatic, though. -Did you see how manly I was? -You were very manly. Kinda dumb. [Harris] But manly. -[Madeleine] Yeah. -[Harris] That's what happens -when I get... -[Madeleine] I had no idea... [door locks] [Harris laughs] What do you expect of people who have a smile button on their door? -That still hurt? -A little bit. Well, here. Why don't you walk on it, loosen it? -You wanna lean on me a bit? -Oh, my pleasure. [both laugh] [Harris] You think they sleep in those robes? I think they do everything in those robes. [Harris] I think you're right. Ooh. -[Madeleine] Better? -Yeah, much. I can't believe I tried to break that umbrella on my knee. [both laugh] [sighs] God. Shit, I missed you. -I missed you. -Yeah? [tuts] [sighs] Why can't we just be together and have a good time? Well, I want to. I told you from the beginning that I... that I just have to take it one step at a time. Maybe we could... just... not talk about what's gonna happen. Okay. Let's do it. -Yeah? -One step at a time. -Yeah? -Yeah. Yeah, I'm no schmuck. [laughing] [Harris] Yeah. [Madeleine] Yeah. They're making umbrellas much harder than they used to. I mean, that could have something to do with it. [Harris] Could have been it.

It gets in your lungs. It's not good for you. It's not. Who told you that? I know it. I learned that somewhere. You're crazy. [music continues] Oh... Sloane? Sloane, Sloane, Sloane... -Sure your name's not Soames? -We made reservations. I know, I know. Took the call myself. Just can't find your card. I wanna take a shower. [man] Well, you can't have a shower unless you've got a room. And I can't rightly give you a room unless you've got a card. We made reservations, you took our deposit. And I'll give you your deposit back if I can't find your card. How about another room? Can't give you your own room, let alone another. Tourist season, you know? How about another card? Nope. Like to, but I can't. Each card's a room. And if there's no cards, there's no rooms. Can't just make up a new room with pencil and paper. [chuckles] I'll tell you what I'll do, though. I've got a sister runs a room and house over on the other side of the island. [peaceful song] Lucille? Yes? -Your brother called about-- -About the room? Oh, the Soamses. -That's right. -No. Ah... Well, come in. [both] Thank you. Soames? [both sigh] [Madeleine shrieks] [song continues] [dog barking] One, two, three. [both laugh] [birds chirping] [Madeleine gasps] -Hey Mad. -Mm-hm. Wanna get married? I don't believe you're doing this to me. Doing what to you? All I said was "Do you want to get married?" Harris, you promised me that you weren't going to bring up -anything about the future. -Madeleine, I'm tired of my promising everything. I have to do the promises, I have to do the compromising, I have to play by your rules all the time! Right, right. I'm the selfish one all the time, right? God, you sound just like Craig. I'm not Craig! I'm not Craig! I'm not anything like Craig! He's someone else entirely. I'm me and he's him. You got a problem with him, you got a problem with him. If you've got a problem with me, it's me. I've got a problem with me, okay? Well, straighten it out! I'm tired of waiting. Well, I'm trying to do it as fast as I can! You keep pushing me all the time. -It's not fair! -I'm tired of being fair! Look, Madeleine. You don't want to commit to shit, let's face it. You just kind of expect me to hang around. -No. -Are you waiting -for someone better? -Oh, don't be ridiculous. You're no prize yourself, you know that? You're no prize yourself. -Try to understand-- -No, you try to understand for a change, all right? You try and understand. All I said you to was "Let's get married". You didn't even give me the courtesy of a "no". You insult me, you hurt me, and I'm sick of it. I hate it! I hate it! -Where are you going? -I don't know! Hey, look, all I want-- Madeleine, you don't know what you want. Let's face it. You don't know what you want. You've got 10,000 theories but you don't know what you want. All right, I don't know what I want! I know I don't! I keep telling you that! How can I make a commitment? Look, if two people love each other, then-- There's more to a relationship than just being in love. Like what? You really mean that, don't you? I mean, you think that if... that if two people just love each other, then that's enough, huh? What do you want to hear, it's not enough? Nothing ever works out? If it's not perfect, then forget about it? Don't even try and make a relationship work? I have tried to make a relationship work. -This is a different one! -It doesn't feel like it! But it's different! All right, you win. You've got it. You win. What? Goodbye. [melancholic music] If you really loved me, you... you wouldn't ask me to marry you. [background chatter] Merde. Ah. Okay, let's head on down to the press conference. You can call her again afterwards. Okay? No, it's not okay. If it was okay, I would do it. But it's not okay, so I won't do it. It's not okay. Nine times I called her! At the airport, before dinner, hm, which wasn't very good, after dinner when my stomach was twisted in knots. One o'clock, two o'clock, three o'clock, all night. And you know what? She's already in Cannes preparing the divorce. That's where she is! And after that... It's no big deal, there's plenty of fish in the ocean. -Don't worry. -Don't worry? My whole life is ruined by this tour! You say "don't worry". I have to go to Cleveland. My wife is divorcing me because I've got to go to Cleveland! What is Cleveland? It's a city like Paris. [stutters] I don't know what I'm doing here, anyhow. You're here because there's 20 journalists down there that would like to get an interview. I'm sick on my stomach of journalists! "Oh, Jean-Fidel, are you really in real life like you are in films?" Ha! Journalists! Women! Telephones, films! I want to be alone. I want to go home. [sighs] Please carry me home. [indistinct chatter] [microphone feedback] Um... -Hi, everybody. -[various] Hi. [many groan] Uh, well, in case you haven't guessed by now, I'm not Jean-Fidel. It's been over an hour, Barney. [angry muttering] Uh, just 15 more minutes, Faye. Just 15 more minutes. Oh, come on! We've got deadlines. [all complaining] Uh, 15 minutes. [all complaining] [match strikes] There comes a time, Harry... [Harris] Harris. There comes a time when a man must stop asking "Who am I?" and must begin to answer it. Well, maybe somebody'll ask you that at the press conference. You can answer it then. Who is he? Jean-Fidel, we really must go downstairs. I don't feel good about myself. I never feel good about myself. I can understand that. You think I am playing a game. But I have real feelings. As a matter of fact, I'm one of the few people who does have real feelings. Don't worry, Barney, I'm okay. Why don't you wait downstairs with the others? -Hi. -[Edgar] Hello. [Jean-Fidel] Mademoiselle. -I'm Jean-Fidel Mileau. -Yes, I know. -I'm Madeleine Ross. -Enchanté. Nice to know you. Um... What seems to be the problem? [Jean-Fidel] Problem? What problem? There's no problem. We've been waiting for you downstairs. Why didn't you tell me? Did you hear that? We are waited for! -Let's go. -Oh. Jean-Fidel! Jacket. [dreamy music] -Harris, all I want is-- -Madeleine. Madeleine, let's face it. You don't know what you want. You don't know what you want. You've got 10,000 theories but you don't know what you want. I don't know what I want! That's what I've been trying to tell you! [laughter] That's very funny. Probably terrific in French. Um, Mr. Mileau? [Jean-Fidel] Oh, please, call me Jean-Fidel. Only the taxman calls me Monsieur Mileau. Ah... Jean-Fidel, tell me, how does it feel to be considered one of the ten sexiest men in the world? There are nine others? -[laughter] -Oh! Ah, excuse me, Jean. Look, now we're running out of time, and we've got time for one more question. -[mixed chatter] -Miss Ross. Ah, thank you. Are you in real life the way you are in your films? -That's an interesting question. -[Edgar chortles] Would you mind repeating it? Are you in real life the way you are in your films? Exactly. Only better. [laughter] [applause] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. [indistinct chatter] -Hi. -Hey. -Fancy meeting you here. -Yeah. So... here we are again. Except for the salad dressing. Little something different? Yeah, about a month ago, I thought I needed a little change. I like it. You got a little curl there. Yeah. -You don't like it. -No, I like it. You know, I liked it the other way, I like it like this. I like it. It's nice. I like it, I... [nervous laugh] It's you. Thanks for all the help with Jean-Fidel. -That was really... -Don't mention it. And I won't write anything that I heard up there. -You can. -No, I wouldn't. -I don't care. -I won't, I won't. Well, it's good to see you again. It's good to see you. I got all these things to do, so I guess I'd better be going. But I'll see you again. Sure. [romantic music] You really think that if two people are in love that's enough, huh? What do you want to hear, it's not enough? Nothing ever works out? If it's not perfect, then forget about it? Don't even try and make a relationship work? I have tried to make a relationship work! That was a different one. It doesn't feel like it! But it was different! [background chatter] Oh... Excuse me, ah, Miss Ross? Yeah? Jean-Fidel really appreciated that astute question. -[murmurs] -[Madeleine laughs] I appreciated his answer. Do you have any more questions you'd like to, ah...? [sighs heavily] Got a perm so that I wouldn't have to do anything with it, and now I can't do anything with it. Straighten it. What if I straightened it? Nah... I don't know. I don't know. I don't know! I'm so nervous! God, I feel... I feel like I'm back in high school again. [chuckles] You should be so lucky. And if you're thinking of bringing him back here, I suggest you tidy up a bit. The cluttered look is out this season. Hey, wait a minute. You know, just because a man has asked me out to dinner, let's not assume that I'm going to sleep with him. I mean, you're acting like I'm a groupie or something! [stutters] I haven't even seen this guy's movies! I mean, he could be a rotten actor, for all I know. Oh, you're planning on writing a review? Relax! Sleeping with him is not a promise of marriage. -Why are you smoking? -[coughs] You don't smoke. I smoke in an emergency. Oh, you saw Harris today! What happened? You know that shit looks better now than he did when we were dating? You're still really into him, huh? [inhales deeply] I'm sorry I mentioned it. Okay. I've made a decision. I'm not going to make any decisions. I'm just going to go to dinner... I mean, you're right, I should just relax. Ha! I'm an adult. I mean, I can just go to dinner and whatever happens, happens. Right? It's easy, just... relax, that's all. Just... So I got perspective. Hi, men. [both] Hey, Harris! -[Edgar] How you doing? -Come on, pull up a chair. [Edgar] Good to see you. Hey, that's the key, man. Perspective. [Barney] Yeah. So, how'd you like today? -Wasn't that ridiculous? -[Edgar groans] -Wow. -What was that? You know, I used to handle these rock bands. I thought that was bad, but this guy, he tops everything, doesn't he? You know these rock bands. Man, they want everything! You know, they want dope, they want women, they want children. [laughs] I'll tell you something. I don't know how you do it, Edgar. Really. It's gotta be rough. [Edgar+ I've had two more weeks of this, you know? Chicago, Dallas... Cleveland. -[Barney] Oh, Cleveland! -Oh! [laughs] I suppose it's not so bad after all. Yeah, because you haven't got two more weeks with him. I suppose you're right. Yeah. As a matter of fact, where is he? He's out. I fixed him up. Good move, Edgar. Very good. Uh, don't you want to order now, Harris? No thanks, Barney. You remember that chick who was at the press conference? Really snappy looking broad, you know? Really nice looker, eh? Name was, uh... Madeleine something. Uh... -Madeleine... -[Barney] ...Ross. [Edgar] Yeah, Madeleine Ross. Hey, I wouldn't mind a little piece of her myself. She's not gonna say no to Jean-Fidel, right? You're a regular pimp, aren't you, Edgar? Uh, what? I said you're a pimp. [chuckles] Never thought of it that way. I suppose you never thought of having your face smashed in, either, did you? What's with him? Hey, look, I'm trying to eat, okay? Oh, you're trying to eat, are you, Barney? -Eat that! -[Edgar] Hey! What the...! What are you, a crazy man? This is a $200 suit! $200 pimp suit. Who's gonna pay for the cleaner, huh? Wonderful meal, you know? And you know lamb chops are my favorite. If it even comes out! Look, you got no right to be jealous. And even if you had the right, you still got no right. You don't own her. It's not his fault. You owe me two lamb chops. You owe me a suit. Shut up. I'm gonna check tonight's receipts. I'll see you later, Barney. I'll see ya, Edgar. You are really crazy, man! [phone ringing] Ah! -Hello. -Hello. Ah, well, what did you have in mind? I mean, where did you want to go? Oh... [chuckles] Well... wherever you want. You know I'm a complete stranger, I don't know anything in this town. -I'm lost. Lost. -Oh. Um... Well, then, why don't we just go here? Yes. [doorbell] [knocking at door] [Harris] Madeleine! Madeleine! [knocking] Madeleine, let me in! -You know something? -Hm? You are one of the most lovely girls I've ever seen. [nervous chuckle] No. Yes! I mean it. I swear it. ["Boogie Woogie Dancin' Shoes" by Claudja Barry] Did you get all dressed up for me? That's very funny, Ruthie. Where is she? Lighten up, Harris. Will you tell me where she is? Where is who? You know who, Madeleine! Where is she? Jesus! A scene. I'm not creating a scene. I got to know where she is. You are creating a scene! Would you tell me? Ain't love grand. Hey, Same Spade! You ever think of trying the hotel? Love you, Ruthie. Hey! Taxi! Taxi! [groans] [clears throat] It's nice, your room. Yes... It's, uh... Nice. Oh! Champagne. [weak chuckle] [both chuckle softly] I'll smuggle this for Nadine. [Madeleine chuckles] Maybe you should try calling her again. -She won't be home to me. -Ah, come on. No. Let me explain. There are two Jean-Fidels. There is Jean-Fidel, -and there is... Jean-Fidel. -[laughs] Well, Nadine is tired of... Yeah, well, she knows it's just a put-on. [sighs] It's very difficult for a man who sleeps with many girls to convince his wife she's the only one. Yes, I could see -where that would be difficult. -Very, very difficult. When this summer, after 23 years, mind you, she threatened to leave me, I promised her no more. And we reconciled. And then... this trip. Oh, that's different. This is business, you had to come. No, she thinks that I came only to show off and to be the big hero, and... uh, seduce young girls. -Oh, that's ridiculous. -No, that's true. Mm. [Jean-Fidel speaking French] [speaking French] Well, you didn't seduce me. You don't want to be seduced. Come on, you didn't even try. Well, are we going to argue about this? No, no, no. I love her very much. Does that sound so strange? No. Except, then why did you come? I came because I'm not ready for a relationship. [laughs] But... You've been married for 23 years! So she should know me by now! Well, maybe you should know her by now! [Jean-Fidel] You don't believe I love her. If I don't get to her tomorrow, I'll never see her again. Jean-Fidel, look, uh... When you walk out on somebody that you love-- Ah, no! Wait a minute! She walked out on me. Ah, it's a technicality. Either way. I mean, the point is that the phone call isn't exactly a grand gesture, you know what I mean? What do you want me to do? Three thousand miles away! She doesn't answer the phone, just to make trouble. Maybe she's getting smart and she's making you work a little bit. One should not have to work at love. It should be natural. Since when? Are you telling meabout love? Huh. Really? [dramatic music] [man] Looks like you missed them. -What? -Uh-huh. Checked out with his girlfriend a little while ago. -Mileau! -Hello. No, where's Mr. Mileau? Oh, I'm sorry, sir. We're not allowed to give out that-- I'm the one who's paying for his room, do you mind? One moment, please. Ah, yes, there is a letter here for Mr. Sloan. -Harris. -Your first name, please? -Harris! -Yes. Uh, sir! There's also a letter for a Mr. Ken. Hey! Did a beautiful girl and a slimy Frenchman get into a cab a little while ago? Can you take me to the airport? Sure, buddy. Hop in. You wanna take the bridge or the tunnel? I feel terrible. You look great. Oh, thank you. It's the first time in my life I don't fulfill a professional engagement. But it's such a great romantic gesture. It is, isn't it? There she is, surrounded by lawyers, and suddenly... I show up. Uh, except you're not gonna show up if you miss this plane. Oh, yes. -Look, get some rest, huh? -Yeah. -Okay? -Thanks a lot, Bar. Bye. [engine starting] [Edgar] Barney! Barney! Barney! Get to the airport! -What the hell's wrong with you? -Come on, let's go! Hit it, man! Can you believe this garbage? So then Edgar... Edgar fixes her up with this French movie star. [taxi driver] Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I go downstairs and this, this note is waiting for me. The note says: [sighs] "I've gone with Miss Ross to the airport." So... So I don't know what I'm gonna do. I tell her I want to get married, she doesn't like that, that's not good. I tell her I love her, that's no good. I mean... I don't know what-- Yeah, yeah, buddy. I heard it all before. Lemme drive, will ya? Lemme get you to the airport. I know she wants her "space." She talks about her space so much, you'd think she's a goddamn astronaut! [sighs] What a shame. [Madeleine] What? To meet such a beautiful girl at the wrong time. Well... C'est la vie. Good luck, Madeleine. Good luck, Jean-Fidel. Hey, buddy! Buddy, your change! [Edgar] Barney, if he gets on that goddamn plane, I'm ruined! I'll never work in this business again. [exciting music] [loud beeping] Empty your pockets, sir. [Edgar] If we were in LA, this never would have happened. -[Barney] Nice tunnel, huh? -Huh? [PA] Mr. Simpson, Mr. Simpson, please report to baggage pick-up area. [PA] Final call for Pan Am flight 2, now departing for Paris. Madeleine, don't leave! Mad? -Madeleine! -Harris! Oh, it's just great, isn't it? We're sold out for tomorrow night, you go run off with the star? Is that what you came running in here to say to me? Of course not! What I came running in here to say to you is that I love you, godamnit! Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to shout, she makes me shout. I didn't mean to shout, but she makes me shout. You see? -The problem is... -I love you. ...there are so many ways which we can go about this-- -I love you! -...I just can never-- [romantic music] What did you say? I love you. I love you. I love you! Mwah! -[all laughing] -I love you! Come on, Barney, get the lead out, man! Wait a minute, what about my car? You jerk! [romantic music] Harris, Harris! Where are they? Where is he? Three! [chuckles] [laughs] Think we'll ever get used to each other? I hope not.
