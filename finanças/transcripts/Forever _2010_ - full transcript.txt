Believe in love, your dreams will come true Wedding Education Department Joey, you and the other actor portrayed the bride and groom perfectly in the video. The music is beautiful as well. This advertisement is exactly what we need to boost our nation's declining wedding index. Unfortunately, our poster campaign didn't meet the target this year. With superstars like Jay Chou and Stephanie Sun still unmarried, youths today simply don't want to get married. If the wedding index doesn't increase by the end of the year, our funding next year will be... And some of you... To turn this tide, I've decided to screen Joey's video at the next "Romantic Awakening" singles' party. Let's pray for a miracle. Whose phone was that? Didn't we agree to switch off all phones during class? Sir, it's your phone. Sorry, excuse me. Sir, it's your fiancée. My boss loves our wedding video. They find it very dreamy. She misses you. Isn't your upcoming concert more important than my fiancée? - No! - No! Okay. Fine, we'll have an extra 30 minutes of class then. Nowadays, it's so easy to make new friends on different occasions. At school, church, online, discos, and of course, here at W.E.D. Just a couple of hints for you. When you sit down, remember to cross your legs. They love guys, gentlemen, with upturned collars. - Please try turning up your collars. - Right. When you talk to him, lower your head, look upwards, and flutter your eyes. Amidst the crowd, W.E.D. will help you find a lifelong partner. We can see that Xiao Ping and Sam's facial features are a perfect match. This indicates that they should get married. They will live very happily. We are concerned about your future and your happiness. Since we're fated to be here today, let's all fall in love! You have pronounced yourselves husband and wife, but always to each other as fate. Therefore, what God has joined together let no man put asunder. So by the power vested in me by the state of Singapore and the Almighty God. I pronounce you man and wife. You may now kiss the bride. Hey! Film us, video girl! Gin, thank you for sending me home. I hope it wasn't too troublesome. It's no trouble. It's on my way home. Why did you start learning music? I fell for a girl when I was eight. She said she only liked guys who played music. So I... Silly, isn't it? This is your music. Yes! How did you know? But it's still a work in progress. It's not complete yet. I love it. I want to use it at my wedding. Seriously? Great. Invite me to perform at your wedding then. Sure. You'll play the guitar and I'll sing. Sure. But I don't have any lyrics yet. Spilling your heart With a guitar The bud of love Slowly grows The lonely melody Pines for the lyrics A new song Is written Hi, Bridey. Groomie, what are you doing? Now? I'm looking at some sparkly, pretty things. I know what it is! Don't tell me. Okay, I won't. I really want to see you. It seems like forever since we last saw each other. You know, there's just so much to do for the big day. I know. Why don't they just call it "a small day"? After all, it's just between two people. I feel the same. But not everyone would agree with us. Right? Joey, will you attend my student's concert this Saturday? Of course. How could I have missed it? Why don't you get your students to sing at the wedding? Well, they'll have to practice more. Mr. Lee, your ring is ready. Okay, I've got to go. See you later then. Bye. Hey. Hi. Are you thinking of me? Of course! Is this for me? You wish. It's for your students. You're so sweet. But there's a problem. What's going on? Groomie! Surprise. - Bye! - Bye! Why so glum? You all did quite well. The audience was so small. We could be better next time. Don't think like that. Even if there is only one audience member, as long as he or she remembers the performance and comes up to us and says... Congratulations. Well done. I could feel your sincerity. Hi Joey, I knew you would come. Sorry. I should watch myself in front of your students. It's all right. It has been a while. The flowers. Are you all right? Don't you have something to show me? Didn't you have something to show me in private? Do I? Excuse me. Give me one second. Hi, I'm your teacher's fiancée. So you're Cecilia? No, I'm Joey. I have to run. My fiancée is waiting for me. We'll celebrate another time. Okay? Thank you, Joey. You're still my best audience. Keep practicing. Okay? Okay. Bye. - Bye, sir. - Bye, sir. Bye! Why are you back so early? It's already past 11 p.m. Where's Gin? Wasn't he supposed to come over tonight? He ran off. He has an exam in the morning. Look at you. You're so messy. No wonder he ran off. I'm tired, Mom. I'm going to my room. Hang on. Sit down first. Sit down. Don't go. I've got a surprise for you. Okay? Happy birthday to you Here's to you finding Mr. Right and getting married soon Mom, it's not my birthday. Don't be a buzzkill. I spent the whole afternoon baking this. I wanted you to celebrate with Gin. But it doesn't matter. Make a wish and blow out the candles. Okay? Baby, I love it so much! As you should. You chose it yourself. Don't mock me. This is a magical moment. I've been dreaming of this since I was a little girl. Really? If that's the case... What are you doing? Give it back. Ceci. Right now, I only hope that every day - and every night... - Wrong finger. I can be with you for the rest of my life. I have a surprise for you too. I'll do it. No, let me do it. Who's calling you so late? It could be one of my students. Can't I just have you to myself? Even for one second? I'm sorry, Ceci. It could be urgent. Hang on. Hello? Ceci, hang on. - Hello? - No, I don't want to wait! - I love you! - Gin! Hello, Terrence? What do you think of Jacqueline? Both of you look so good together. James? He's very handsome. Abacus, no one caught your eye the last time. You really like Ping? What about Yan Fang? He works in an international law firm... What? You won't date someone who doesn't have an MBA? And someone with no car and no bungalow? She'll also join us for the tea dance. Congratulations. What about Zhi Min? Take the initiative and ask her out. Come to our tea party this weekend. If you tie the knot before the end of the year, you'll receive a complimentary three-day-two-night stay at the Grand Copthorne Waterfront Hotel! What about Shanty? How about trying again next weekend? See you then. Okay! Bye! Hello? This is the most people we've had since 1999. And the most qualified singles since 1987. And the best food since 2003. This is all thanks to Joey. Indeed. Look! What are the two of you doing? Get down! I love you... - I love you! - Wrong number! - Wrong number! - I love you! Sorry, I was talking to my fiancé. I'm Sam. We wanted to tell you that your video really touched us. You and Gin really have that couple look. Are you and Gin really getting married? Do you know him? He used to be my guitar teacher. He's an excellent guitarist. Do you like music too? I'm sure your kids will be very talented in music and very cute. I'm just overwhelmed with joy. You don't look too well. Are you all right? Maybe I'm just exhausted. I've been tied up with wedding preparations lately. I understand. By the way, Joey. I've been planning for a new promotional video recently. Will you have time to film it? The one for the New Year? That's right. The theme is "The Most Romantic Proposal." It'll be 60 seconds long and broadcasted everywhere. Since you and Gin are getting married, why not do it again? Gin wouldn't mind, would he? No, for the sake of our nation's wedding index, I'm sure he'll do it. That's great! Our budget isn't big. But I'm sure you'll make something wonderful. There's hope for W.E.D. You really are our brightest star! Cheers. Yes, it was filmed in Genting Highlands. There are lots of butterfly samples. Taiwan has lots of different butterfly species. Really? I enjoy spotting different butterflies in Taiwan. I love butterflies. Really? I think I look like one today. Yes, you do. Is this you when you were a kid? You were - Bridesmaid. - a bridesmaid. You looked good in the bridal gown then. At that time, my biggest dream was to be a bride. Really? Now your dream has come true. I guess you can say that. Hey, do you mind if I keep all these photos? So when were you going to tell me you were engaged to this foreign music teacher? He's a music scholar from Taiwan, Dad. And he's teaching at a school you are a patron of. You! But he can't even speak English. I love him. And as if your Russian mistress speaks any English. You have defied me for the last time, Cecilia. That's what you said last week. Cecilia, you come back! Cecilia, come back. My mom won't care if you can't speak English. She'll still be crazy about you. Joey? Your students performed well today although their singing could have been better. What are you doing here? I came to give you this. You forgot to take it the other day. You came all the way here just to give me this? No. I'm also here to tell you some exciting news. Come with me. Is this your office? Yes. Then this must be your desk! How did you know? I know everything about you. Joey, my childhood photos? Right. I almost forgot. This is for you. My mom made them. Thank you. This tastes different. This is Prince's favorite. Prince is... My cat. Joey. Thank you for the DVD. Here's my new CD. Groomie... Thank you. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Gin Lee's Guitar Music Your new music can be used in our new video. Our new video? Remember the exciting news I wanted to tell you? My boss loves the video we made last time. She wants us to make another one. The theme this time is "The Most Romantic Proposal." Joey, I don't think I can do it. Why not? I just... Don't worry, we'll work around your schedule. No, Joey, this is not about my schedule. You were very natural the last time. Don't worry. Joey, I know we had fun the last time... I can pay you double. Joey, it's not about the money. Please get up. Joey, please get up. Gin! What are you doing? Ceci, this is Joey, my friend from W.E.D. Cecilia, my fiancée. Why is your friend from W.E.D. kneeling in front of you? I'm here to get Gin to promise me... To help her make another video. I haven't even seen the first one. Is it a corporate video? Corporate video? Of course not! I'm not talking to you. It's all right. It's nothing. Groomie, I'll be seeing you again. "Groomie"? What is that all about? We made a video together some time ago. She came to ask me to be part of another one. She called me "Groomie" because we played the bride and groom in the last video. That's all. What do you mean by "That's all"? You played the bride and groom. What the... This is way out of line. Ceci, I've already turned her down. - What's wrong? - It's just... What do you mean? There's nothing to worry about. You have a lot of explaining to do. I've already told you. She just came to... Ceci, I... Dearest Gin. Since our heartfelt connection in this wondrous world, there have been no more disappointments. No more regrets. Only hope and joy in my life. You and I are simply meant to be. Did someone drop off this package? It doesn't look like a bomb, so why are you being so cautious? For Gin's parents It must be from Cecilia and her dad. It smells great. This is the green cake I love! How generous of them! The one that tastes like coconut toothpaste? This is a pandan cake. It smells delicious. Let's have a taste. Wait! Why can't I have a taste? I just want to make sure that you'll like it. Why won't we like it? Exactly. We eat this cake all the time. Let me cut a slice. Mom! Let me do it. Let me taste it first. Can we have it now? Let me cut a slice. Son, this is for you. This is for myself. I'll bring the rest to school for my students. I think they'll be very grateful for it. This boy... The longer he stays in Singapore, the ruder he becomes! Ma'am, is this place big enough for the wedding? Yes, I should think so. Aren't you going to New Zealand next month to film your wedding video? We want to come along too. Don't we? Ceci, didn't we agree not to shoot in New Zealand? That was before I found out you shot some random video with some strange woman. You must be hungry. I'll ask them to serve the food. Good! My stomach is growling. Mr. Wong is not here yet. Let's wait a little while more. My dad might still be at work, but he has already ordered many dishes. I hope you'll like them. Prawn crackers. Sunflower seeds. Chicken nuggets. Canned luncheon meat. The servings are so small. Did Mr. Wong order these? Could just be appetizers. But canned luncheon meat? Do you hear that? Hear what? My music. It sounds good. You've improved. Miss, where did this music... Barbecue pork buns. Spicy stinky tofu. Two bowls of rice. And chicken feet. The menu is completely wrong. Where's the abalone, shark's fin, and suckling pig? I think your dad has his reasons for ordering these foods. What reasons? He probably thinks this is what we eat back in Taiwan. I never knew my dad could be so thoughtful. He certainly is. He even knows chicken feet are my favorite! A heaven-sent taste! Excuse me, I'm going to the men's room. Joey? Joey? Joey, what are you doing here? What is all this? This was the most memorable day of my life. Of course I had to preserve everything as it was. Joey, this is all wrong. Wrong? The only wrong thing is that woman sitting outside! Please help me with the new video. We'll be in Japan during winter atop the snowcapped Mount Fuji. Your students will serenade us. In a perfect white world, you hold me tight as I rest in your arms. We kiss passionately. Joey! I know it may be hard for you to accept. But... But I only made the video with you to help myself prepare for my own wedding. Do you understand? You must be freezing. Me too. Let's go out first. Yes, let's leave this place. Joey! You should go home yourself. I have to go with my parents and Cecilia, my fiancée. We're getting married, don't you know? How can you love someone who doesn't appreciate you? Don't you know that we're perfectly aligned musically? Even our horoscopes, birthdays, and age are heavenly matched. Our first meeting was not by chance. It was divine intervention. I believe we are meant to be indefinitely. Gin, please! Film this video with me. My future depends on you. Joey! Joey! Your future can't depend on me. Your future depends on yourself. Do you understand? You don't understand. You don't understand what it's like and how sad it is to be alone! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! It looks good. It's pretty. This one is my favorite. It's nice. Pretty... Isn't it too pink? You look better in it than I did. Gin is a lucky groom. So tell me. How did you and Gin first fall in love? Mom, I've told you many times already. I watch Korean dramas every day. Your story and those stories are all muddled up. Just tell me one more time, okay? All right, I'll tell you one more time. I believe In love at first sight I believe In destined love I believe in everlasting love I believe in you and in myself I'm sure my heart belongs to someone I've decided to only belong to you I want you, like how you want me A melody could be lifted for the lyrics A theme song could become the interlude A finished movie could have a different ending But true love is irreplaceable Okay, I'll do the video. You promise? But you need to promise to never bother me again. Let us carry on with our lives. Let Cecilia and I have a peaceful wedding. Okay. I'll let her go peacefully. Welcome to this week's sharing session. Is everyone ready? Let's begin. Viv? I care the most about his appetite. So I eat the same food as he does. So we can be gastronomically connected. Once I become a beauty queen, I want him to know that I'm dead serious about making this world a better place. Ever since he rejected me, I've gotten ill. I want him to share my virus and we'll care for each other in bed. Men only truly care about their mothers. So I must try to be just like his mom. As you know, I care most about his body. Ris. After six months of persuasion, I've finally managed to get him X-rayed from head to toe. I'm going to frame these up and display them in my living room. And I'll share his body with everyone who comes to my house. I don't belong here anymore. I want to search for true love. I no longer want to rely on lies and deceit in exchange for an empty relationship. Why can't he see that I'm his one true woman? You looked so cute as a little bridesmaid. Actually, Gin and I are already engaged. This year is already looking hopeful! See these sparkling, pretty things. His one great love. His only Bridey! Where did you go? I'm sorry for being late. Joey, come here. I want you to see something. See what? Look. This is a complete insult to our work at W.E.D. I can't take it anymore! Are you pregnant too? Congratulations! I want you to find out who's doing this and report them. Take down all these videos as soon as you can. I'll get to it immediately. Joey, I'm relieved that you're here. Please get started then. You have no proof that I did these videos. I won't go down without a fight. That's too bad. I was going to ask you to make another one. They're not engaged. They're not even friends. You'll believe me when you watch the tapes. I hope you haven't given her the money for the new video. You can't trust her at all. Sorry I'm late, Petrina. Here is my proposal for the New Year's video. We need to talk. Let's talk about my proposal first. It's set on a beautiful, remote island. You can hear birds singing and waves crashing. There is only Gin and I... And the police. There has been some disturbing information about you. I need you to explain it to me. What information? Where should we start? Excuse me. Someone is looking for Joey. Who is it? She didn't say. She's at the reception. She must be my replacement. I'm going on leave for one week. Who says you can take leave? I'm going to prepare for the most stunning video W.E.D. has ever made. Joey! Joey. I believe you and Gin will be speaking at this weekend's "My Love, My Dream" seminar, yes? I'm counting on you guys. Cecilia? I can't believe he gave you all his baby pictures. What did you give him in return? If you want to talk about Gin, let's go. Did she take the money? She must be in some kind of trouble. Don't be so quick to accuse her! What's going on? I haven't finished watching this. I want to see if he kisses you in the end. He doesn't. Where are you taking me? Are you afraid of me? Of course I'm not afraid. Why is this happening to us? It's my fault. I recommended her. She seemed eager and hardworking. It was all an act! But she's a very talented girl. Perhaps she's not thinking straight. How do you know it's my car? Joey? Who cares if you only have a diploma and not a degree? Are you in some kind of trouble? What do you think? Who cares if you and Gin aren't really a couple? Who cares if you stalk him? Joey, come back! I've always wanted to bring Gin here. My heart has long become numb from medication. My heart had long been dead. I never knew that it could be revived until Gin and I... Slept together! We didn't! My colleagues just found out I was lying. They wanted Gin and me to become ambassadors for W.E.D. But we aren't even friends. Since you're not even friends, what do you want from him? One evening, I realized the Gin in our video loves me. But the real Gin only loves you. After listening to his CD that night, his voice came whispering to me in the air. I thought it was a dream. He said his album is dedicated to a very special girl. Cecilia. For me? You didn't finish listening to the CD? Not yet. But I still really love Gin! Then are you willing to do one thing for him? Anything. Ask him to make a wedding video with you. I'll shoot it for you. And the video he did with me will be buried in history. He won't do it. He said he won't do any wedding videos again. Then do one on your own. Give it to him as a gift, just like he gave you his CD. I'll ask my boyfriend, TK, to help me. I won't charge you any money. TK? TK is Singapore's most innovative wedding director. I have to go. Please allow me to make amends. I promise you'll be satisfied. And you won't have any regrets. That Cecilia is so hot! You've bought the whole country back. Son, will you thank Cecilia for us? It's a pity we didn't get to meet her dad. I hope we'll meet him at the wedding. We'll be back again soon. Mom, if I don't get married, will you be very disappointed in me? Don't say that! I think I'm cursed. Every time I fall in love, something bad happens. Even when I'm in Singapore, I still can't escape it. Did I do something wrong? Maybe I should just remain single. Being on my own isn't so bad. At least I can get a dog and play my guitar every night while he howls at the moon. Silly boy. The longer you stay in Singapore, the softer you've become. You're not soft. You're just special. You need a special girl who can see that in you. The both of you will make a happy symphony. More like a tragic symphony. A love symphony. If you believe in love, your dreams will come true. Gin. There are some things I've always wanted to share with you. Many years ago, I was a flower girl. I stood in front of the bride and groom. Before we walked down the altar, I reached for the page boy's hand. My heart was beating so hard, I could hear it in my ears. It was the most incredible, joyous feeling. Like a butterfly flew into my chest. It was at this time that I dedicated myself to this feeling of happiness that only comes when shared with another. But this feeling was hard to hold onto and often slipped through my fingers. I tried to hold onto this feeling with Benny, Walter, Meng, Naresh, Alan, Faizal, Professor Bill, and Mr. Ong. I tried to find the same fluttering feeling with them. But none of them came close. My heart died a long time ago. But now, it has fluttered alive again. It's all because of you. You have allowed me to love boldly again. To enjoy that feeling once more. Do you know? Our happy and touching wedding video is now my biggest comfort. Thank you for promising to film with me again to continue our beautiful story. It will be my one and only faith in life. Thank you. Thank you for your love. Thank you, my little butterfly. Hello, Auntie. Is Joey home? Get lost! Calm down, please! I'm not a bad guy. Mom, don't open the door to strangers. Gin! Is it really you? Do you know who I am? Please excuse my mom. She's senile. No problem at all. I'm sorry to stop by unannounced. I just wanted to speak to your sister. Joey is not my sister. She's my tenant. She looks after my mom when I work night shifts. Joey is a very good girl. You know that, don't you? That's why you like her so much, right? We know she has some problems. But she has never caused us any trouble. Your parents really love the pandan cake I made them, right? Yes, they loved it. Thank you, Auntie. Do they also like this wedding video? I've not even seen it myself. Really? My mom has to watch it every night. If not, she can't sleep. Let me tell you. Prince likes to watch too. Here, have a cookie. I know this is Prince's favorite cookie. Let's look for Prince. Come with me. Come with me. Prince? Prince? Prince? Prince? This is Prince. He says he wants to see the video now. Surprise! You really came. I can't believe that I'm really here either. Joey. Do you even know who I am? What is the reality to you? It's real as long as I believe it's real. Gin? Ceci? What are you doing here? I should be asking you that. She said she'd leave us alone after I did this video with her. But she and her boyfriend are making me a video as an apology! What sort of video are you making? And who are you? Let me explain. From the beach, Cecilia will spot you and Joey kissing on the boat. She'll be pissed off and she'll jump into the ocean. But the strong currents will carry her off while you and Joey drift into oblivion on a boat with no oars. Okay? What? Joey, is this your idea? You bitch! I'll kill you! Ceci! - Ceci! - You're totally wrong for him! - Stop it! - Even if I'm wrong, I don't have to die! - I'm willing to die for Gin. - What are you two doing? - This is just fantastic. - Ceci! Award-winning footage. Ceci, stop! Ceci! Stop it! Enough! That's enough! - Enough... - Liar. Ceci... - Enough! - She took my ring! Quick! Get my ring back! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Wait! Where are you going? Joey! Stop running, Joey! Wait! Are you satisfied now? Is this the ending that you wanted? No, this isn't the end of our story. A melody Could be lifted for the lyrics A theme song could become the interlude A finished movie could have a different ending But true love is irreplaceable So is this my love symphony? Then should I not resist fate? Gin. What you shouldn't resist is love. Why? Why have you gone this far for me? Because you're unique. Look who's talking. That's true. That's why I say we're a match made in heaven. Joey Tan! That's Joey Tan! She stole my ring and wanted me dead. Arrest her! Quick! What are you waiting for? Quickly put her away! Not every girl looks good in gowns. You look like someone who is destined to be a bride. Thank you. You look pretty good yourself, Groomie. What? Groomie? Groom is English for a husband to be. I see, Groomie. So you are... - A bride. Bridey. - Bridey. Which one are you in the photo? Don't tell me. Let me guess. This is you, right? You're spot on. Joey, you're no longer the girl in the video. Obviously, you've recovered. Dr. Seet, it's all thanks to your good care. Don't mention it. You've regained much confidence and found balance mentally. But most importantly, you will... Follow nature's course. - Don't go to extremes. - Don't go to extremes. - Live a safe and happy life. - Live a safe and happy life. That's very good. I'm confident that you'll be fine. All I want now is to contribute meaningfully to society. Joey, we've got a surprise for you. Ris. How did you know? -Happy birthday to you -Happy birthday to you -Happy birthday to you -Happy birthday to you Joey, make a wish for your 28th birthday. This is the first time I'm celebrating for real. Joey, you are our brightest star. Don't let us down. Let's go. I've lost control of my feelings I'm sure my heart belongs to someone I've decided to only belong to you I want you, like how you want me A melody could be lifted for the lyrics A theme song could become the interlude A finished movie Could have a different ending But true love is irreplaceable - Bye, Joey! - Bye! Take care of yourself! You've got this! Stay in touch. We'll miss you. Bye! Did I forget to take my medicine this morning? You didn't. But... you forgot to take this a few months back. I don't know if this will help me. I also don't know if I should have it. I know this will definitely help me. On top of that... I know I want to have this. I'm scared. So am I. Where are the snowflakes?
