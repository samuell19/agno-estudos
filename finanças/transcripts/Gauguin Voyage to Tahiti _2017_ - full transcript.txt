Is Hector around? He has an appointment with Mrs Pastourelle. - Thanks. Mr. Gauguin is presenting us his vigorous talent here... timid even... not to mention charming. Charming? Christ as a Papuan divinity... only vaguely carved in the branch of a tree. Well, you should keep some distance, that's true. Here in front of us... we see a blend of glorious brutality of catholic liturgy and Hindu meditation. Give me what you have. It will be fine. I'm sorry, nobody wants them, but I believe in you. Take this in advance. It's the same everywhere. All the time about money. It takes all of our time and all of our energy. It's enough, it's time to end it. We have to go, get out of here. How? We have no money and nobody supports us. Degas has contact with Renan. He can give us a foreign mission to Polynesia. Polynesia! How long have we been talking about this? Polynesia is a long way. - 'Polynesia is a long way'. But... Paul, a foreign mission is unpaid. I invest everything I have. What little I've earned I'll spend for the trip. Besides in Tahiti there's no need of money. You fish, you pick fruits, you hunt... and you paint... you paint! It's... it's complicated also. It is far away, it's not safe, we can not leave just like that. Yes... Madeleine wants us to get married. You too? I take Mette and the children with me. Growing up in the shadow of coconut trees that doesn't hurt anyone, isn't it? When I'll have saved more money, perhaps, but why leave now? Because I choke. Because everything is rotten, filthy, disgusting and worn-out... there's no face or landscape that deserves to be painted here. So? Who's in? What are you doing here? Look who's here. Come here. How heavy he is! You weigh one hundred kilograms. But you're so big I hardly recognized you. You are so cute. So cute! Come. My big one. Come in and make yourselves at home. Come in, dear. All right. That's it. It's a little chilly, but... It's modest, huh? Here you are. - It stinks here, mom. It's disgusting, look. I don't want to sleep here. Fortunately I thought of getting mattresses for the children. I didn't think you would arrive so soon. It stinks in here. What did he say? Good night. Good night, sweethearts. You have no idea how happy I am you're here. We're not going, Paul. But why do you say that? I have been thinking. I can't do that to our children... to us... in fact, to no one. When I see how you live... I can't do it. All this is all about you! Leave. Do what you have to do. Don't be angry. Is it your family who put you up to this? We've talked about it a hundred times, Mette. You can't give up now. They are worried about the children's future. I'm telling you, life can't be taught only by books. And who says it's better in Paris or Copenhagen than over there? You see, again... you're shouting at me. You're being selfish, you don't worry about the children. In the world I live in and the one you also lived in, if you remember... studies are important if you don't want to end up like a poor. Mette, you must come with me. I can't. - Mette... I can't. Come with me please. I need you. Dear friends! Please! Please! A few words! Please! A few words. Let's raise our glasses... to our beloved Paul! Accept all our encouragement, Paul. All our pride... all our friendship. It will follow you, I hope, to the end of the world. Because that's where you've decided to go. You are a hero to all of us, Paul. And yet... and yet... You're just doing your duty here. You will never be like those small time artists... who in order to survive follow the current. These fearful who have given up... who have surrendered... for all kinds of morality. The morality of the ass. The religious morality. The patriotic morality. The morality of soldiers and police officers. You are a savage, my dear Gauguin, like all of us. And you... You have decided to keep that in mind. Gauguin, here. Here are the lemons. Is there a money order? If it's a money order, you'll have to pay what you owe me. Paul, I know you will blame me for the following words. That you never want to hear my point of view... which is so different from yours. We are not coming to join you. I do not support your project. Of all the works you assigned me... when you left, not a single one has been sold. We are short of money. 100 francs is all I can send. Your children miss you. Our home misses you. Every day my family is pressing me. They are pushing me to divorce... of which, from now on, I no longer resist. You had a heart attack, Mr. Gauguin. You need care and rest. Drink this. Slowly. There are indications of rather serious diabetes. You need an enhanced diet otherwise your condition will deteriorate. It's your neighbor who brought you here. I would like to hospitalize you in Papeete. Is there anything you need? Well, get some rest. Jotepha... my dyes, please. What are you doing here? Where do you think you're going in your condition? I'll get some fresh air, that's all. I don't want to die without seeing Taravao Plateau. I have applied to move you to Papeete. Well, I'm not going. Do you hear them? Do you want to hear? Until here they came to poison us. I'll disappear into the woods. What you're doing is irresponsible. After all, is it your responsibility? Here, keep this. I entrust you with this letter. I only ask you to post it. Take good care. There are spirits on top of the mountains. They are in the wind. They are in the trees. In the water that flows down trough the valley and in the rocks. Be careful not to wake them. I'll keep it in mind. Goodbye. Mette... I am a child. I'm a savage. I can't be so ridiculous because I'm two things who will never be. Those who blame me, mainly your family... do not know what it means, 'the nature of an artist'. Let me live this life for a while. I keep on going. I have a goal. I will prove to you that I am right. I am a great artist and I know it. It's because I am that I endure so much suffering to pursue my journey. Otherwise I would consider myself as a bandit. There will be a day that our children can face anyone... and anywhere... with their father's name as protection and honor. Don't... not the dyes! Give it back... No! Give it to me! No! Not the dyes! Okay, okay, okay... Give back the paint. What's your name? Paul Gauguin. Kok?? - Gauguin. Paul Kok?. - Kok?. Me... Onati. - Onati? Onati. - Onati. My wife... Ruita. Ruita. - Eat, eat. Where are you from? - Mataiea. Where are you going? Taravao. Thank you. Are you looking for a woman? Are you looking for a woman? Do you want Tehura? Tehura? Tehura, come here... sit down. Tehura, do you like him? Yes, I like him. Do you want to live with me in Mataiea? Yes. Kok?... Tell me, are you a good man? Yes. If after one lunar cycle... Tehura doesn't feel happy... she will leave you. Yes. Matari'i. - - Matari'i. We call them the Pleiades. What does it mean 'Matari'i'? Temau Mata. Ri'i, ri'cu. The eyes? Small eyes? Small eyes. Do you know who... created the heaven... and the earth? Do you know? Do you know? - Yes. His name is Ta'aroa. He stayed in the void... before human beings... before the earth... before heaven. The rocks... are Ta'aroa. The sand... is Ta'aroa. Ta'aroa slept with a woman called 'goddess of the outside'... or 'goddess of the sea'. Out of there relation emerged... the black clouds... the white clouds... and the rain. Then Ta'aroa slept with a woman called 'goddess of the inside'... or 'goddess of the earth'. Out of there relation emerged the first seedling. Later Ta'aroa slept with a woman called... Hina, 'goddess of the sky'... 'goddess of the rainbow'... and 'goddess of the moonlight'. The jaw that goes up, like that. Go ahead. Otherwise we can do it like this. Look, like this. So, and then... like this. Oh yes! Agreed... Figure out... a position... something I... Cross your legs, that's it, cross-legged. Maybe hold up your arm a little... rest your head, like that. Like that, okay. Good. Keep it straight. Good morning. Listen. Tehura... Don't move. Please, Tehura. Tehura! Okay. No. Look, the body... I'd say, in the direction of your feet, okay. The hair well backwards. Do not move. It's good that way. Good day. - Good day. Good day. I'm sorry to disturb you. I heard you were back. - So what? Did you come to keep an eye on us? This is from the clinic. I thought it couldn't harm you. There. How do you feel? - I've never felt better. I paint and draw all day. I live to the beat of what surrounds me. I think I can say that I've never felt more... sharpened. It's a Tahitian Venus. It's very beautiful. It is the genuine Eve. She is wild... and immaculate. She's very beautiful. Since she's here... I live again. I understand. - No, there's no need too. But, that's not all. When you want to reinvent yourself, you have to return to the source. To the infancy of humanity. The Eva that I've chosen is... bestial. Anyway, if you continue at this pace... there'll soon be no more linen available on the island. If you knew all I want to ship if I could. Do you know what's most miserable? That they prevent me from working. I've received nothing from Paris since... several weeks. Well, okay. Am I dead? No... not yet. If you don't get a treatment, I'll find you at the bottom of a bed in the clinic... or in a coffin. - I believe anything, I... Yes... I might have a fucked up heart, but... the brain works. I have confidence. I have confidence. And fortunately by the way.... if I'd known, I would've put a bullet in my head long ago. He's waving with his tail like all of us. He screams out his mating call which goes like that... No... Like that. Yes, we do agree that... it's my life, I'm leaving it to you. Don't worry. Tomorrow at noon you're on the ship. What are you doing here? I need canvas. Is there something that's usable? Stop blaming the mess on me. Tehura! Try with both arms backwards. - Like this? No. Try to bent the other leg. Try to bent the other leg. That's okay? - No. It looks like you're... It almost looks like a pose, but it's not. It should be something you do naturally. Raise your leg. Like this, you see? No. Can you put your foot here? Yes, like this, like a bird... a bird on his foot. And you look over there... over there. In a way that is totally... That's very good. Okay... this is good, with the face looking over there... It's lovely that way. That's what makes a painting. All on one line! All on one line! One line! Don't cheat! One... two... three! Yes! He's the winner! Ladies and gentlemen! May I present, miss Tehura de Montelimar de Montesquieu! We applaud, please! Oh, she's so pretty! Hey, Paulo... Kok?? I want a white dress. Why? You look fine like that, you know? I would like a white dress to go to church. What d'you want, I have no money. What do you want me to do? What nonsense is this, you want to go to church? This is none of your concern. You don't expect a letter? Yes. I don't know when it will arrive... and it can take some time. And then when you'll get your letter? You get on my nerves! Out. Jotepha! But stop imitating! That's not what you should do. Dare... imagine... yourself! It's not what others do that matters, it's what you'd like to do. Do you understand? You! Look at me Tehura, please. Look at me. Look at me. I'm hungry, Kok?. I know. Come, keep looking at me. How much for the statue? Thirty francs. I'll take it for ten. Here, have a sip! Common, drink. Don't go! Come here! Come on! Tehura? Tehura! There were no candles left... in the hut. The spirits got in. Don't move. Don't move. What? What is it? Wei... I need your help. My wife needs food. I've helped you a lot already. My wife and my children also need food. I work really hard for it. Thank you. It's good? Yes. I caught three. In all three of them... the hook... got stuck in the lower jaw. They made fun of me and said... that means... my wife cheated on me. Kok?... If you think it's true... you must hit me very hard. Hard! Hit me! Otherwise the anger will always haunt you. It will never leave you in peace. No more... never! See you later. It's not bad what you're making. Yes. It's good. That one, what is it? What is this? This... for the whites. This what they buy. Is that what I taught you? Is that what you learned? You didn't understand a thing! And all that you retain? To begin with, give back my chisel! No. - Give it to me! Give it! She had a miscarriage. She'll be back on her feet, she's young. Don't worry. And you? Look at you! What are you still doing here in this rusty hut? Tehura... Tehura... Tehura, it's me. It's me. I'm here. It will be alright. Kok?? - What? I want to go home. When? How? You can't in your condition. It's too far, it's too dangerous I need to see my mother... and my grandmother. No, you can't go there. I don't want you to leave. Tehura... I will take care of you. Open up! Open up! What's the matter? Is your son here? No. Do you know where Tehura is? No, I don't know. Leave now. Leave. Tehura! Tehura! Tehura! Repatriate me like a poor? - That's right, yes. I have all the reasons to be worried, Paul. You should return to France. If you get a good treatment over there, you can come back. I can't leave, that's it. I stay here. You work as a docker. It pays my rent. I need it. You don't even paint anymore, Paul. Here you are. I leave it with you. You don't have to sign it now. And three carrots. What is it? Where did you get that? - Thirty francs. Thirty francs. Thirty... Hail Mary, full of grace... the Lord is with you... blessed are you among women and blessed... is the fruit of your womb... I'd prefer you don't go out today, okay? Okay? Tehura? What are you doing here? I was waiting for you. I'm going back to France. I know. In 1893 Paul Gauguin, exhausted, is repatriated to Paris... by the Ministry of the Interior as 'distressed artist'. He exhibited 41 paintings at Durand-Ruel to mixed reception. After a trip to Brittany to see his friends and to Copenhagen to see his family... Paul Gaugain returned to Tahiti and the Marquesas. There he painted some of the greatest masterpieces of Modern Art. He died in solitude and deprivation on 08 May 1903 He never saw Tehura again.
