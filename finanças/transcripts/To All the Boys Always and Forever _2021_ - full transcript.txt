Dear Peter. Hello from Seoul. By the time you get this, I'll probably already be home. But I couldn't leave without writing you. You always tease me for being such a homebody. But I think you'd be proud if you saw me here. - Kimchi! - Kimchi! Everything my mom told me is true. Korea is beyond anything I could've imagined. We've been running around nonstop, trying to see and do and eat all the things before spring break is over. We're having an amazing time together. Although, my dad might be having the best trip of any of us. Hey, girls, I think I want to ask Trina to marry me. Oh, my God, Dad! This was all part of my master plan, so boom, you're welcome! But the best part is spending time with my sisters. We got it. We got it. ♪ I'm so fancy ♪ ♪ Can't you taste this gold? ♪ ♪ Remember my name ♪ ♪ 'Bout to blow ♪ Ooh! You know, the truth is, I've barely had any time to miss you. Just kidding. I miss you like crazy. Fingers crossed, I get into Stanford, and we never have to be this far apart again. I love you, Peter. Always and forever. Like a lingering fart. Or nay, a bruise that never heals. Kitty. I'm just saying, this is a little dramatic, even for you. Oh, my goodness. Look at these cupcakes! I miss him! With the time difference, I barely talk to him all week. Oh, my God. The horror! Is it just me, or is she getting meaner with age? - And more opinionated. - Thank you. Okay, all I know is I'm glad you guys are both going to Stanford next year because you are not cut out for this long-distance thing. Okay. Well, don't jinx it. I haven't gotten in yet. Maybe you should wait until you hear back from all of your colleges before you make a decision. Well, Peter's going for lacrosse. It's a great school, and it's perfect. Okay. Hey, Covey. Hi! - Did you get the photos I sent you? - I did. Uh… but I didn't open them. It's bad luck to see campus before you get in. It's not a wedding, Covey. You're not marrying Stanford. Can't be too careful. So, how was the visit? Amazing. It's… This campus is huge, and just wait until you see the library. You went to the library for me? Hey, you know, sometimes I read books that don't have pictures, Covey. The lacrosse team is tough, though. I don't know if I'm gonna be able to start in the fall. Well, you wouldn't have gotten a scholarship if you weren't good enough. - College is not like high school, Covey. - I'm kinda counting on it. What about you? How's the future? You're, like, 16 hours ahead there. Tell me what Friday's gonna be like. I promise I won't disrupt the timeline. Well, it'll start off touristy, and then it'll get really fun. You'll buy presents for someone you love, and if you're lucky, you'll eat doughnuts. Uh, there was this one thing. This girl, she came up to me speaking Korean, and it's like, they see me and they think I understand and then I don't, and it's like I don't belong. I don't know. I guess I just wish that my mom was here to teach me. Well, I bet Stanford offers Korean classes. We could take 'em together. I can't wait to see you. I gotta get to practice. Uh, is your dad taking you to the locks tomorrow at Seoul Tower? Mm-hmm. First thing. Okay, well, good luck finding it. In two days, I'm gonna tackle you and smother you with kisses and give you gifts. I love you. I love you too. Ever since Peter and I made a plan to go to Stanford together, I feel like I'm waiting for our future to begin. It's the perfect school for us. He'll play lacrosse. I'll study English Lit. And best of all, we won't be one of those couples that breaks up because of college. I just have to get in first. ♪ I'll tell you what I want What I really, really want ♪ ♪ So tell me what you want What you really, really want ♪ ♪ I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna ♪ ♪ I wanna really, really, really Wanna "zig-a-zig", ah ♪ ♪ If you want my future ♪ I think the waiting might actually kill me. - So tall! - Seoul Tower. - How many floors? - It's 130.

I'll ask someone. - Okay. - Excuse me. Hi. Oh! Uh, could you take a picture? Ah. - Thank you. - Thanks. You're welcome. Oh, you speak English. So do you. Look how much we have in common. - I'm Dae. - I'm Katherine. That was weird, that's not my name. Kitty. Well, Katherine's kind of my name, but people don't call me that. - Call me Kitty. - Ah, okay. You can call me whatever, though. - It's fine. - Okay. - Kitty. Okay. Yes. - Sure, yeah. Katherine Song Covey has discovered boys. God help 'em. And you, buddy. Thank you. Girls, I'm gonna help Trina with her bags. - I want you to go on in without me. - It's one bag. I got it, honey. Let me help you with the bags. - Bye, Tri. - Bye, ladies. Bye, Tri. - See you in a bit. - Get some rest. Impressed with you getting those. Hi, Covey! Peter! Oh. I missed you too, kiddo. Especially when I made that sign. Hmm. Your spatial planning could use work, but I appreciate the glitter. She approves of the glitter. Mmm. - I missed you. - I missed you more. - Hi. - Hi. Mm. Ah. Character socks! Come on! Thanks. They were kind of hard to find in your size. No, no! Truce or else you don't get your last present. Yes! I got it at Seoul Tower, so someday we can go back and put it on. I love it. - Hmm? - Mm-hmm. Ew. Aren't you supposed to make out after the movie's started? Not with Lara Jean. She doesn't even let me talk once the movie starts. It's because I want you to actually watch it. And it's my turn tonight, and we are doing Say Anything. There's this great scene with John Cusack, and he sits underneath the window. - He holds up a boombox-- - Okay. That's awesome. We get it. So, I have a very important question for you, Peter. What is the best text you've ever gotten from a girl? I'm… I'm sorry, what? Kitty met a boy. - Kit-- What? - Mm-hmm! - He's from Korea. - What is his name? Dae. And this is the first time I'm contacting him. - So it has to be memorable. - Dunno why you're asking me. You should talk to Lara Jean. She's the queen of love letters. Yeah. I said "memorable," not "cheesy." Ow! Okay, okay, okay. I promise to coach you on your game if you promise to teach me how to braid Lara Jean's hair. Okay, but you're never going to master the French, Kavinsky. Oh, I mastered the French. You guys are disgusting. Oh, yeah. Because we're good at kissing. - Kitty met a boy. - Mm-hmm. That's insane. They met at the love locks. Such a good meet-cute. - What's a meet-cute? - Have you learned nothing from rom-coms? Always make grand gestures. It's okay to interrupt a wedding… A meet-cute is when a couple meets for the first time. It's always cute, and that is how you know they're gonna end up together. I wish we had a meet-cute. Well, you jumped my bones at the high school track. That was pretty cute. That doesn't count 'cause we already knew each other. We don't have a song, we don't have an anniversary, and we can't remember how we met. We are a terrible rom-com couple. I remember when we met. - You do not. - Yeah, I do. You don't remember when we-- when we met? I am offended right now. - Okay, so tell me, how did we meet? - No! You don't deserve to know. Liar. Liar? Did you call me a liar? Tickle-- Mm? Who was that? Ah, it was nothing. It was just my dad. I guess he heard about Stanford and wants to take me out to celebrate. - Wow. - Mm-hmm. That's huge, Peter. Are you gonna do it? Nah. Maybe he's proud of you. Maybe. He doesn't really get to be, though. He had nothing to do with it. - Did you know… - Hmm? …that you smile in your sleep? Wait, what time is it? Um… It's almost curfew. Wait, what? Mm-hmm. You gotta go. What if I didn't? Then my dad would kill you. - No, he wouldn't. - Hmm. But he'd give you his disappointed face, which somehow is much worse. You know what I'm looking forward to the most about college? Hmm? Never having to say good night. - Good night. - Yeah. Yeah. In movies, love is always about the big moments. Grand speeches made in front of everyone, "marry me" written on the Jumbotron. But maybe love is actually about the moments when you think no one is watching. Oh, good for Dr. Covey. Trina's rad. And hot. - You bring my zit cream? - Obviously, Chris. You are a gem, LJ. Hey, any word yet from Stanford? No, and it's killing me. Thank God we don't live in the olden days. Acceptances used to come by mail. I can't stop thinking how terrible it'll be if I don't get in. You will. Or you'll come take a gap year with me and work on a farm in Costa Rica. So, what other schools are you waiting to hear from, LJ? Berkeley and UCLA and NYU, but I only applied there for Margot. She said I'd be a failure at adulting if I didn't have at least one East Coast option. She's not wrong. Oh, what's going on over there? ♪ You are, you are the answer ♪ ♪ You got all of my affection ♪ ♪ You got, you got, you got All my affection ♪ - ♪ My attention, my affection ♪ - Chris, stop. Molly Marshall, will you go to prom with me? Yes, of course. Yes! Yeah! She said yes! - Yeah! Whoo! - That's what I'm talkin' about! Ugh. You know who likes prom? Lemmings. With their fancy dresses and mani-pedis and blowouts. Like you don't get blowouts. I saw you on a date with Trevor last week. Oh! I thought you were off again. We are. We're just hanging out. - Uh-huh. - We are not dating. Mm-hmm. Not everything that is popular is lame, Christine. Some things are popular because they're cool. LJ, tiebreak. Prom, yay or nay? It doesn't matter what she thinks. Peter's gonna be prom king. She has to go anyway. Hey, I heard you went to Korea for spring break. That's awesome. I know you always wanted to go. Thanks. It was. What? You know she's still the actual worst, right? - Yay for prom. - Ah. - Just give me a little bit. - Stop taking my girlfriend's cookies, bro. Hey, Lucas. What's it gonna take for Chris to go to prom with me? Make sure no one else is going. Promposal me, and it's over, Trevor. So you're saying that there's something between us that can be ended. Hey, guys, you have your permission slips for the senior trip to New York? - Dipti, you are so responsible. - New York City, baby! I left mine in my locker. - Thank you. - There you go. I think these are your best cookies yet. They're still too crunchy. We have to go to Levain in New York. They have the cookies to beat. Oh, I should-- Oh, by the way, I shared an album with you on Spotify. It's What's the Story Morning Glory by Oasis. - We need a song. - Our song is not gonna be on a '90s album. - Have you listened to Oasis? - Not on purpose. Talk to me when you have. - Okay. - Want some cookies? We've both been married before. We don't want to make a big fuss. No, no, no. You should absolutely make a fuss. Do you know how long it took Dad to find someone who will eat his cooking and watch his documentaries? Long time. Let's just have it here at the house. We can have a big barbecue/wedding in the backyard. You could make some desserts. Oh, honey, I love that idea! You guys, I love that idea. Can I be one of your bridesmaids? - Kitty, you can't just ask that. - Why? Yes, you can. I would be honored to have you girls as my bridesmaids. And we can do a sparkler send-off. That's my one request. And we could do a sparkler send-off. Yes! Okay, color scheme. - Neon lime. - Veto. Food? - Chicken nuggets. - Yes. - Really? - No. - You okay, Lara Jean? - Hmm? - You okay? - Yep. I just remembered that there is something that I need to go take care of. So, I'm gonna do that-- Henry! Are you okay? He's okay. As you were. Hmm. Is she okay? You get used to it. I never did get used to it. You seem pretty used to it. Okay, you got this.

All of your safety schools are within a day's drive from Stanford, tops. Dae and I are way longer distance and we're making it work. But, we had a plan. We were supposed to hold hands while riding bikes and play footsie in the library and wear Tree hats to football games. You don't even like football. It's just so not the point, Kitty. Hey, it's gonna be okay, LJ. You and Peter are going to figure this out. Hey, is everything okay? No. Lara Jean didn't make it into Stanford. - Kitty! - Okay, let me talk to her. Hey, LJ. I'm so sorry. Why? You didn't want me to go there anyways. No, that's not true. I just wanted you to keep your options open. You know, NYU has a 12-story library. Please don't use this low moment in my life to campaign for NYU. I'm not. I'm just saying. Look, Stanford is not the only college in the world. I never thought I'd end up in Scotland, and I know it doesn't feel like it right now, but this could be a really good thing for you, you know? Force you to see the world. Well, I'm not like you, Margot. I don't wanna be far away from my family. I didn't mean it like that. No, it's fine. I should get back to bed. I have an exam tomorrow anyway. I'm gonna go. What am I gonna tell Peter? Honey? I know. - I got in! I got in! - No way. Oh, my God, Mom! No way! - You got in! You got in! - No! I got into Stanford! ♪ For the very last time 'Cause it's just me and my mind ♪ It's strange, to spend so much time wishing for something and then have it be over. "There's a truth universally acknowledged… that a high school romance never lasts long distance in college." Yeah, everybody knows that. Just look at Josh and Margot. We're not like them. Then what are you so afraid of? You know, I mean, maybe we make it to Christmas or the end of first semester but… four years? You're making this worse. Go away. Oh, crap. Smooth, Covey. Real smooth. Peter, hey. Um, hi. Yeah. Ha-ha! So, funny story about that text. Uh… It was meant for Margot, but it's okay 'cause even though I didn't get into Stanford, I still might get into Berkeley or UCLA, which are only a few hours away by… by car… which I try never to drive. Oh, God. Oh, no. Uh… Uh, Peter, what are you doing? I'm celebrating your first night as a Cardinal. Come on, girl. - Congratulations! - You mind turning that down? 'Cause I really need to tell you-- We can talk about what you want to talk about after we get pancakes. On me. Come on. - Let's go. Get in the car. - Do I have to wear the hat? Of course you have to wear the hat. Gotta rep the Tree. You gotta fear the Tree. That's how it works. Tonight, we're celebrating. My girlfriend has gotten into Stanford University today. Congratulations. Oh, you must be so excited. What's your major? Uh, no, that doesn't really matter-- Come on. Tell her. Baby, tell her. Come on. Just tell her. English Lit. I know that's what people choose as their major when they don't really know what they want to do in their life, but I actually really want to do it, so… Well, the best part is we both got in, so we're going together. Now, if that's not a sign that we're meant to be, I don't know what is. Well, I'm happy for you both. Do you think that we can get strawberry pancakes? And… Uh, just two forks. Coming right up. You don't want anything else? I'm not really that hungry, so… Peter, I need to tell you something. I didn't… I didn't tell her to put whipped cream on it. Hold that thought. I'll be right back. I promise. I'll be right back. Do you remember the first time we came here? After Greg's party. Our first public appearance as a fake couple. You were wearing that blue jacket and that little dress, and you were calling me out on all of my shit. And I knew then that I was falling in love with you.

Love you! - What you watching? - Romeo and Juliet. Tragic romance before 8:00 a.m. Must be pretty serious. I didn't tell Peter about Stanford. He was just so excited, and I didn't want to crush him. And if I don't tell him, then it's not real yet. Yeah, I get that. You know, I know I'm new to this whole stepmom thing, but I'm pretty sure you can't call in sick from a relationship. I'm not proud of myself if that makes a difference. I mean, it helps. Can I make a suggestion? You only get one senior year of high school, and if you spend the whole time worrying about what's gonna happen with you and Peter, you're gonna miss the whole thing. My God, you've got a hot boyfriend. Go enjoy him. Don't, it-- Don't, enjoy-- Like, in public with the ice cream and holding hands is a good thing. Just no texting and driving. You know, Tri, this whole stepmom thing suits you. Thank you. But I will tell Dad that you said that. Girl, I will cut you. - UC Berkeley just tweeted. - Oh, my God. We can do this. We can do this. - Mm-mm. No. - Come on. Here are the passwords. You do it. - You sure you don't wanna do it? - I can't. I'm bad luck. - Give it to me. - Okay. Well? She got in. You got in! I got in? Where? show me! No! Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh! Hi, Henry! It isn't Stanford, but Berkeley's an hour away. That's practically like going to college together. You left this downstairs. It's all your college portal logins. Keep it. You're officially in charge of all my college acceptances. Seriously? Cool! Hey, Kitty. On a scale of one to ten, how much are you gonna miss me when I'm gone next year? It's way too early for this talk. You can be honest. I don't know, a four? A four? You told Margot that you were gonna miss her a 6.9. Yeah, I was a child then. And she's nicer than you are. You could at least pretend to miss me. It's only decent.

You should consider giving Peter a picture of you to put up in his dorm room at Stanford. Ooh, yeah! You should do a boudoir shoot. Chris, no. Why not? They're classy. Uh, because I'm 17, so I actually can't do a boudoir shoot. And also, Peter's never seen me naked. You mean like, you always wear a T-shirt or keep the lights turned off or… No, like, we, uh, haven't… We burn low and slow, okay? We're like, um… brisket.

No, I… I was just calling my boyfriend, but I got his voicemail, so… Okay… cool. So is he going to Berkeley too? - Stanford. - Oh. I wanted to go, but I didn't get in. That sucks. I'm sorry. It's okay. We're gonna make it work. For sure. No, for sure. I totally get it. I had someone I wanted to go to college with too. Uh, what happened? Um… I visited NYU, fell in love with this city. I don't know. It was weird. I just felt like this was where I was supposed to be. We figured out what was best for us. Hey, your crew seems to be having a good time. Yeah, um, you know they hate each other. Not tonight they don't. ♪ Want under my skin? Oh, you gotta work for it ♪ ♪ Oh ♪ ♪ You gotta work for it ♪ - We gotta go. - Now, while the trains are empty.

What? ♪ Let it roll off my back ♪ Get that door! - Okay, I'm going in. Wait. - Nope! Sorry. Okay, right here! Okay. I'm dropping it. I'm dropping it. Oh, God! - Lower. - Okay. Okay, okay, I got it! - Oh! - Get in! Stand clear of the closing doors. Yes! You got your couch. - Oh, my God. - I said, you got your couch. You know, this could be us someday. I could see it. Crazy. I'm so sweaty. I need to shower. - I have face masks up in the room. - Oh, dibs on the robe. Covey. Peter, hi. What are you doing up? - Waiting for you. - Oh. You never texted me back. I was worried. Sorry, it's kind of a long story. I'll see you guys up in the room. Am I hallucinating? Are they getting along? Careful. They spook easily. How was your day? It's better now. I missed you. Come on. Let's go to my room. I missed you too. Did you get the video I sent you? Yeah, I did. It was, you know-- Cool song, but I wasn't there for it. So, I feel like I should be there for the song that we make ours. Yeah, but it was that moment. I felt it. Well, we can always come back to it if we don't find something else. How was the world's best cookie? I don't know, Margot. I didn't expect to feel so surprised. I knew Tri was moving in this weekend. She practically lives here anyway. It's like the world keeps shifting under my feet when all I want is for it to stand still. It just feels weird. It is weird. Mom is all over that house, and now it feels like she's being erased. I mean, are you upset they're getting married? No, I just never pictured it. But… it's kind of nice, right? Dad having someone. Even if that someone does own a blue velvet headboard. Ew! Don't talk about their bed. I'm sorry for the stuff I said about you leaving. It's okay. I shouldn't have pushed you about New York. No, you were right. I totally loved it. You did? Yeah, I mean, I thought that I was gonna hate it or I thought that I would feel overwhelmed, but I could really see myself living there, you know? I get why so many books are set there. Everywhere you look, there's a story. And NYU has this amazing lit program where they invite real authors to come speak to their students. And I could even intern at a publishing house. So, it just, um… doesn't really matter 'cause I'm not sure that-- I don't even think I got in, so… LJ, college is about more than just geography. I know that. But Berkeley is a great school, and if I keep my grades up, I can transfer to Stanford. Now that Peter and I have a new plan, everything could go back to normal. Just make sure that's what you want. It's what I want. Don't worry. Nope. Hi. What do you think about go-karts? Like, in general or… For Peter and me. Fast and Furious is one of his favorite movies. Okay. Well, there's nothing fast or furious about go-karts. What about one of those indoor skydiving tubes, Impossible or James Bond? Soap-making. Fight Club. What is happening? I'm planning a date, and it has to be fun and normal. And you think teaching Peter Kavinsky to make soap is normal? Maybe I should just give him all three options and have him choose. But not soap-making? Absolutely not. Put it back. All right, Covey. Where we going? Excellent question, Peter Kavinsky. One that I asked myself many times while planning this evening. What is the perfect date for my perfect boyfriend? Dude… let's go bowling. Did you just quote The Big Lebowski? Yes. - Ready? - Yes. Let's go! Oh, you're cute. Come on! Wait, wait. But I-- I'm gonna put this in my dorm room. - What if I want to put it in my dorm room? - That's too bad. Peter. Dad. You must be Laura. I've heard so much about you. - Lara Jean, Dad. - No, it's okay. It's not okay. You're my dad. You should know my girlfriend's name. Apologies, Lara Jean. Very nice to meet you. You too. Have you given any thought to dinner? Yeah. I'm just really busy right now. You know, I'm training a lot for college. Well, you gotta eat, right? Let me take you to that steakhouse you love. The place with the big knives. Yeah, Dad. They were big when I was, like, five. Well, in any case, I'd love to see you before you go. You want to come bowl with us? We're just getting started over there. No, no, that's all right. Thanks, though. We gotta go. But, uh, thank you. Have fun with the… with the fam. Okay. I can go with you if you want. No. No, he doesn't get to bail on us and then just have it be okay. Well, it doesn't make it okay. And it will never be okay, but at least it could be something. So you think I should go? I think that if I had… a chance to spend one more night with my mom, I would take it. Yeah, but it's different, LJ. Your mom didn't leave you. Not-- Not by… by choice. I'm not saying it's easier. You think of your mom, and you miss her, right? I think about my dad, and I hate him. And… and I miss him. And then I hate that I miss him. Hey. There is nothing worse than not feeling chosen. I choose you, Peter Kavinsky. I choose you too. I don't know… what I would do without you. - Oh, I love your forehead kisses. - You do? - Mm-hmm. - Even if I get lipstick on you? You mark me as yours. Like your shirt? Gonna wear it all the time? You kidding me? I'm wearing it to school tomorrow. - No, you're not! Really? - Definitely not. That's not happening. Well, it smells good in here. I am experimenting with the wedding cake recipes. That's it. We're done. I'm breaking up with him. - With who? - Who do you think, Dad? Dae. He hates Harry Potter. He said, and I quote, that "it's so dumb." How am I supposed to be in a relationship with someone who thinks the greatest literary achievement of our time is dumb? Well, I know. But, honey, it's okay to have differences in relationships. If you feel the same way about everything, you'll never grow. Mm-hmm. So, you're saying I should try and change him. That's very much not what I'm saying. Kitty… what is this? Oh, yeah, you got into NYU. And you just decided not to tell me? Well, you're going to Berkeley, so it doesn't matter. No, you're not allowed to be mad at me because I am heartbroken and sad. What? You got into NYU. Are you kidding me? Good for you, honey. It's cool. Do you know the best part about you getting into Berkeley? We're going to be able to meet in San Francisco on the weekends and explore the city. We never could have done that if we were both going to Stanford. We're going to be able to go to Golden Gate Park, Muir Woods, Fisherman's Wharf. And we're going to try every single piece of sourdough that city has to offer. Are you listening? Covey, are you listening to me? I was just saying that we gotta go to Tartine Bakery when we're in San Francisco. Apparently, they have the best cookies in the city. Oh, right. Sorry. You know, I was just thinking there aren't that many romances set in San Francisco. There's The Wedding Planner and The Bachelor, but that's about it. New York has all the greats. You've Got Mail, When Harry Met Sally, Annie Hall, Serendipity. It's… it's really not a competition. Yeah. I didn't know that there was a competition. Oh, it's not. I was just thinking. - I'm this way. - Okay. Bye. I can't decide. Navy goes better with Peter's tux, and we did plan to match, but… I don't want to disappoint him. Is the pink more me, though? Will I regret it if I don't wear it? Will I look back in two or ten or 20 years and wonder if I made the wrong choice? I mean, how am I supposed to know… …what choice would make me happier in the future? What is wrong with you? What? Nothing. Why? To limo or not to limo? That is the question. Is it? Yeah, Kavinsky wants to be buzzkill and keep it low-key, but I'm saying that we only get one prom. See? That's why I didn't want to go. Put a school dance in an ugly hotel ballroom, and everyone wants to get all extra. Mmm. So limo is a yes. The sunroof and black lights and some little… I know a guy. Hey, Gen. Can I talk to you for a sec? - Yeah. Um, I'll catch you later. - Okay. - Oh, my God, cute shoes. I like those. - Thanks. What's up? So, I got into NYU. What? That's amazing. Isn't it? I mean, yes! Yes it is, um, but… should I go? Why are you asking me that? I just don't know what I want, and I figured you're going… I don't know. Well, I don't know what you should do, but I know the way you looked at New York. It was love at first sight. Hey, if you do decide to go to NYU, just let me know. Hey, you still not sleeping? Figured I might as well practice the wedding cake. Mint chocolate for you. Vanilla buttercream for Tri. That seems like a lot. Why don't you just bake cookies? That's your specialty. 'Cause I haven't perfected my recipe. Hey, do you think you and Tri would be together if you didn't live close or is that part of it? Yeah, I guess. I guess it was, but proximity's not the most important thing. So is space, and a good relationship has both. Three thousand miles seems like maybe too much space. Nah, not if it's what you want. Listen, Lara Jean, you gotta stay true to yourself. Okay? You can't save this relationship by not growing. What is it? I messed up the cake batter. Now it's gonna be like cookie dough. I like it. - Have enough syrup? - Mm-hmm. - Butter? - Mm-hmm. Whipped cream? You probably need more whipped cream. I'll just-- Hey, Joan, can we get more whipped cream, please? Sure. Hey, so I'm thinking about going to NYU. What do you mean, you're thinking about it? I want to go to NYU. And I know that's not what we planned, but they have an amazing lit program, and I really feel like I belong there, Peter. And I'm afraid that I'm gonna regret it if I don't go. Please say something. I don't know what to say. Um… I wasn't expecting that. It's far. It's, like, really far away. But it's only a year. I guess we can make anything work for a year, so… I'm not sure I'm gonna want to transfer. I think I might really love it there, Peter. And wouldn't that be great? Isn't that the whole point? Wait, so… So that's it? No more Stanford. You're-- You're going to NYU? Okay. I mean, it's your future. Right? And you gotta do what's best for you. I can't say no to Stanford. You can't say no to NYU. I guess we have made our choice. Here we go. - Thanks. - Mm-hmm. Do you want to talk about it, or…? No. We're good. We're good. Boo! Hey, you're getting out of here too! Well, Sarah Lawrence is only a two-hour train ride from the city. I'm coming over every weekend, and we are gonna go dancing and have a good time. I'm guessing he didn't take it that well. Uh, no, he did, which somehow felt much worse. You are going to figure it out. Okay? You're totally relationship goals. If there's anybody that can do long distance, it's you and him. Hey. What's up? Make it memorable, romantic, and no quotes from famous dead poets. Covey, yearbooks are for people you're never gonna see again. That's not true. They're for remembering where you were in this exact moment in your life. So, you're saying that you're gonna need help to remember me? - No, that's not-- - Hey. If it's important to you, I will absolutely sign it, but you have to write me an OG love letter. And I'm talking, like, middle school OG. Well, you already got one of those. Yeah, well, then you gotta make it memorable. Mason jars or tree rounds? Mason jars are overrated, Tri. What? Why? No, I like them. Are you planning a wedding or a Mumford and Sons concert? That's mean. - Are you watching baseball? - Oh, yeah, who's winning? Who cares? How can anyone enjoy this? Kitty promised to watch Dae's favorite sport as long as he read Harry Potter. Yeah, in retrospect, not a fair trade. Have you decided on the color for the bridesmaids dresses? We should really put in the order. I'm not wearing a dress. I'm wearing a tux with sneakers. - Excuse me? - What? She said I could. I did. - No. The three of us should match. - Oh, great, then wear a tux. You're gonna ruin the whole look. Well, it's not your wedding, Lara Jean, so stop trying to control everything just 'cause you're freaked out you and Peter are gonna break up. Kitty. Why would you say that? What? You know I'm right. Maybe, but that doesn't make saying it right. Well, there's still plenty of time to back out, you know. Never. Dear Peter… ♪ Slip inside the eye of your mind ♪ ♪ Don't you know you might find ♪ ♪ A better place to play ♪ How do I tell him that I can go 3,000 miles away and still never let him go?

I mean, if you're lame like that. Uh-uh. No, I am not… I'm not making a grand entrance down those stairs. Well, it's the only way down. The window… - You're gonna fall out the window? - …is always an option. No. Uh… can you guys turn around? This is so embarrassing. Not a chance, Chrissy. - They're so… - I know. Oh, they look beautiful. Wow. Uh, you… you look… wow. You look wow too! - You do. - Thank you. You look so good. Did you tie your own bow tie? - You're like a painting. - Oh, stop it. But please, no.

Okay, then what's wrong? I don't know. Something just doesn't feel right. Why now, on prom night? 'Cause I want to feel close to you. And ever since I told you about NYU, you've been acting really distant. So what? You want to have sex with me because you're feeling insecure? No, that's… that's not what I mean. What did you expect? You literally chose to go as far away from me as possible. You chose distance. That's not fair. What's not fair is you acting like this is just gonna be okay.

Come on. - You're saying goodbye. - That's not true. I want to be with you. That's all I've ever wanted. Then why aren't you going to Berkeley? 'Cause I fell in love with New York. But that doesn't change the way I feel about you. We could still make this work. No. I'm not gonna wait for this to end in three or six months or however long we last. - No, please don't do this. - Let's just end it now. Peter. I love you.

You made the right decision, Lara Jean. Mm. Then why does it feel so bad? Trevor. I may or may not have agreed to start dating him again last night at prom. Before you get too excited, it is only until I leave for Costa Rica because I have plans and I am not swerving for any man. Well, I'm happy for you, Chris. I've always liked you two together. Mm-hmm. It seems a little backwards though, right? Me and Trevor get together the same night you and Peter break up. We're in the darkest timeline. Lara Jean, can I come in? Lara Jean's not here. Please leave a message. Who leaves messages anymore? What do you want, Kitty? I didn't forget to tell you about NYU. I chose not to. What? Why? I don't know. I guess I was just scared you were gonna go. I'm gonna miss you a 12, Lara Jean. Oh, come here. - Margot! - Hi. Oh my goodness. Hi! Oh, it's so good to see you. Hey, listen, Margot. I know it must be weird coming home to all this, but I don't want you feeling like I'm trying to take over your house. Well, it's our house now, and I haven't seen my dad this happy in a really long time. Thank you. Okay, so… It's crazy that I can feel so sad and so happy at the same time. My love story is ending, but my dad and Trina's is just beginning. I guess that's what happens when you grow up. Everything gets all mixed up together. Peter. Hey. Hey. And I thought I was early. You hungry? No, I'm good, thanks. Are you sure? I'm buying. Yeah, no. I'm sure. Thanks. I'm really glad that you called. I didn't think that you would. Yeah, well, you know. Lara Jean thought that I should, so… You two have fun at prom? Can we just-- Can we not? I just-- I can't do the thing where you act like you want to be my dad. Get you boys something to drink? A coffee, please. I'm fine. Thanks, Joan. Okay. Look, I know calling or sending a card on your birthday isn't enough. I'm trying to fix that. Two months before I leave to college? I want to be part of your life. Yeah. Well, then, you know, maybe you should have been here for it. 'Cause I did everything without you and I still don't need you, so I'm sorry that there's a disconnect between you and me. You're mad, and I get that. I would be too. But you have to know… I… I wasn't leaving you. Then why does it feel like it, Dad? Because I screwed up. I didn't try hard enough. I should have tried harder to be your dad and I didn't. If you love somebody, that's what you do. You try to do everything you can. I love you, Peter. You don't have to stay here. Thanks. - Hey, Joan. - Mm-hmm? Can I get a coffee too, please? Sure. What? You're buying. …so you may grow together through all the twists and turns of your life? I do. And do you, Trina, take Dan to be your husband? Do you promise to love him, cherish him, and hold him, but not too tightly, so that you may grow together through the twists and turns of your life? I do. Then, by the power vested in me, I now pronounce you husband and wife. Whoo! Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the newlyweds, Dan Covey and Trina Rothschild. Oh, hi! Hey!

Good night. ♪ Days just turn into months ♪ ♪ Two hearts turn into one ♪ ♪ Summer fades into a glow ♪ Dear Lara Jean. you told me to write something memorable, so here it is, my memory of the first time I met you or, as you like to call it, our meet-cute. It was sixth grade assembly. You were sitting in the row in front of me, and your name was written on your backpack in glittery letters. Principal Cho called you up on stage to receive an attendance award, and your hair got caught in your chair. I helped you untangle it, and you smiled at me. My heart did a somersault in my chest. I didn't know hearts could do that. I had no clue then that you would become who you are now, the most important person in my life. Sometimes, I can't believe how lucky I am that you chose me. We've been through so much together, Lara Jean, and I never should have doubted that we'd get through this too. But, I got scared and I hurt you. I am so, so sorry. Of course you should go to New York. You should do all the things you want to do. I never want to be the guy holding you back. I want to be the one by your side. It won't always be easy, but I want to do whatever it takes to make this work because that's what you do when you love someone. And besides, if we're gonna be together forever, then four years of college isn't such a big deal. If you agree, then please consider this our new contract. I will love you, Lara Jean. Always and forever. Peter. Hi. What do you think of our new contract? I love it. - Yeah? - Mm-hmm. So, does that mean… …it's a deal? Deal. ♪ Stay with me until we need to go ♪ One last thing. ♪ Sometimes you get what You've always been wishing for ♪ ♪ But most times it's not on your deadline But that's all right ♪ I thought you didn't like this song.

Christine Donati. Lucas James. - Thank you. - Peter Kavinsky. - Genevieve Mitchell. - Thank you so much. Trevor Pike. Give it up. Adler High School senior graduating class of 2021! My whole life, I've wanted the kind of love you see in the movies. Boombox over the head, hand in the back pocket of your jeans kind of love. Boy meets girl, they break up and make up, and they live happily ever after. Thanks for coming. But, in real life, that's not where the story ends, it's where it begins. Because life is beautiful, and messy, and never goes according to plan. And the truth is, I have no idea what it has in store for me. But, I do know that love, real love, is choosing each other through all of it, every single day. Beginning and middle and end. I know what most people are thinking. Two kids, 3,000 miles apart for four years? No way. They'll never make it. But we're not like those other couples. We're Lara Jean and Peter. And besides, you know one thing 3,000 miles is good for?
