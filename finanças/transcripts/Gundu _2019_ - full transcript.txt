They just brought in the new load. How can you expect the money already? I don't have even a rupee on me. I'll call you. Wait. You come and collect it. I'll call you when the money comes. I'll call you, then come. Come and collect your money. If somebody calls, ask for their name and write it down. Sure, sir. Carry it gently! What are you doing? Carry it gently, what are you doing? Okay, Boss. What are you doing? Why have you dumped it here? Shut up. Didn't I tell you to use the gas-cutter to separate the brass from iron? But gas-cutting is extra labour. So, about the wages-- I'm the boss here, not you. Just do as I say. You can't do as you please. The one that exploded is not the only bomb. Thousands of similar bombs lie in the bottom of the ocean. During the Second World War, a ship from Britain carrying weapons and gold... exploded at the Bombay Harbour. More than 5,000 people lost their lives. Though some of them exploded, several tonnes of bombs laid dormant at the ocean bed for years. These bombs were of assorted variety with varying capacities. These bombs were discovered a few years ago when the Bombay Harbour was dredged. To neutralise these active bombs, an American company, and a fake Indian company created only for this purpose bid at the auction for Rs 2,000 crores. But instead of neutralising the bombs, the two companies joined hands and dumped them in the deep waters of Bay of Bengal, and claimed that the project was completed. During high tides, the bombs underwater... drifted ashore all along the coast, from Nagapattinam through Orissa. People often mistook it to be scraps of Iron and brass, or even wreckage from the ships, and attempted to pry it open... Thousands of lives were lost over the course of years. But the ruling class continue to cover up the cause of these deaths, and murder those who try to expose this malfeasance by filing false cases. each wave still sweeps ashore a bomb. 'The Last Bomb of The Second World War' 'The Last Bomb of The Second World War' Get away from here! Get away! I said, get away! Rathan, I got news from our sources that a bomb has washed ashore in Mamallapuram. Call the police right away and capture that bomb. No one should know about this. Doesn't matter if lives are lost in the explosion, it must not be found in one piece. That is important. If that happens, not only will I get exposed, our plan for the ten thousand crore arms manufacturing plant will be jeopardised. Careful. Silence this issue before it goes to the media. Will take care. Bhai! Aruppu... Bhai isn't here now. Just drop off the goods now and collect your money tomorrow. So? Did you find it? I said we should phone you and keep it inside. He said we must keep it outside. It was covered in muck. So I left it outside. It was gone in the morning. It's not some jewellery or vehicle to brush off when it goes missing. If the media or public were to find out it went missing from the police station... "Your station is not safe, how will you keep us safe?", won't they spit at us? Here, check the bill. It's just 3.5 tonnes. What? You said it'd be 5 - 6 tonnes I drove the vehicle. Won't I know the weight? I've run this shop for so many years... Come, Aruppu! Wonder which truck he stole diesel from! Velu! Two big ones and a small one. Yeah? - Okay, Aruppu. Measured in pots or litres? Whatever Aruppu says. 'Everything in it's place, Is the way to peace.' Wise words. I saw it, too. Looked like a ten inch pipe covered in muck. Yes, sir. Munusami, along with the German girl, got drunk on her booze... and went on blabbering that it's a bomb. So it's not a bomb? Here... draw me a bomb. Sure, sir. There. Sir... that's what bombs look like, don't they? You get drunk and call it a pipe and such rubbish? Bring in everyone who came to the station. Okay, sir. - Dismissed! Bhai! - Yes? Can I collect my payment for the iron scraps I brought yesterday? Come on, I don't have one rupee in the chest. I'm just sending the load out. - Alright, Bhai. Get going! Bhai! Good thing I remembered. I told you about Selvam, right? He's struggling. You have paid half the amount? Give me whatever you've got. I'll pay the balance. - OK, bhai! Please help him out. [Man singing Therukoothu folk tune] 'Our sweat nourishes the land we till; Our hearts reap misery and trouble.' 'Our dreams keep knocking at doors; Will they ever be welcomed with open arms?' 'Our labour is capital, feeding your greed; Our lifetime is spent, burning to ground.' 'Our fight is for fair remuneration; Will it ever be a given?' 'When has asking nicely ever made a difference? Revolution is our only chance.' 'Don't falter when there are hurdles; It will lead to an insurgence.' Tell the prospective bride I drive a 12 wheeler. Selvam! Stop it! I've said countless times, a driver shouldn't mind the shop. Do they pay us twice the salary? - Don't shout, explain calmly. Where does he listen to me? My salary is still due. 'Like futile raindrops on a parched desert; The fruit of our labour is lost.' 'Like the tiger crouches before the kill; We will win our rights, we will.' 'Our sweat nourishes the land we till; Our hearts reap misery and trouble.' 'Our dreams keep knocking at doors; Will they ever be welcomed with open arms?' Who told the owner that I complained about the salary? Can't you guess who would have ratted? Puncture, the snitch. If we let ourselves be divided in the name of caste or region... the pittance they pay us will only buy us daily bread and booze. 'If our suffering should prolong; There will be an upheaval.' 'If a hissing serpent should attack; Even the meek will fight back.' 'May all these barriers shatter! What's to gain from yet another border?' 'May all these rivers join the great ocean! Let's come together, a glorious union!' 'Like futile raindrops on a parched desert; The fruit of our labour is lost.' 'Like the tiger crouches before the kill; We will win our rights, we will.' Yes, a load of apples. I drive a Torres truck, Uncle. I'll make a stop at a restaurant in Hyderabad... Some life this is. Shame on you. Sorry, I was at a toll gate. 'Our sweat nourishes the land we till; Our hearts reap misery and trouble.' 'Our dreams keep knocking at doors; Will they ever be welcomed with open arms?' Chittu, I'm busy so I cut your call. Can't you understand that? Hello! Chittu, are you stupid? I said I'm busy. - It's you who's stupid. You're acting too pricey. When did you tell me you were driving? You just cut my call. How would I know if you were driving a lorry or a flight? When are you not driving? I called to say what's happening, but you got me worried about you. What? You're getting married. Go ahead, who cares? You're probably calling me because your family must have picked a loser. But you act like you were all worried about me? Good job, Missy. The groom hasn't gotten here yet. I'll know whether he's a loser or not only when I see him. You're something. Get lost now. Hang up! Chithra, open the door! Sumathi, I'm coming. Such a pain. Is she coming? What? Everyone's waiting for you. Come. Always on the phone... Drink this water. Drink up. It's for your own good. Go on, drink it. What the hell? - Calm down. Wait. I told you, we should have taken her to the Hill Temple in my village. But you're obsessed with your family's stupid rituals. If this goes on, we will be on the streets. Shut up. She's behaving this way because she wants us all dead. Runaway mongrel. You deserve to go around with him in that lorry. And you're a trained teacher! - Be patient, son. Father, please don't say anything. We have completed the ritual. She will never think of that boy again. You can start the wedding preparations. I've told you several times, I will only do a job I like. If you don't want a driver, marry a district collector. Constantly pestering me... Why is it always, "They said this, my friend said that"? If you don't like me, leave. The clouds keep me company, moving with my lorry. I never drive alone, you know. The clouds, the moon, the stars... you, my father... I talk to everyone when I drive. He called you a "driver", but you just kept mum. They don't address a collector as "collector". Or a minister as "minister". You should have punched him in the face. Why don't you speak up for me? He pays my salary, so he calls me that. You've called me "driver" so many times! This is not so bad. I don't want you to love me out of sympathy or pity. If you trust me, we can live an awesome life. Otherwise... you'll end up singing about "betel leaves and nuts" and sit at home doing household chores, like the heroines in Tamil movies. Ridiculous. You know what song you'll end up singing? What? "I'm a heartbroken Romeo." "I've come looking for you, my love." "O Juliet!" Or, you can sing, "O Chittu!" Yeah, right. I'll whack your head. Get lost! - You get lost. Stop the purchase, stop the purchase. Don't spend on nuclear weapons while the people starve! Do not buy nuclear weapons! Zindabad! Jai Bhim! Zindabad! I'm on the way, Bhai. There is a lot of traffic. Where are you? Basha will yell at me. There is a protest happening on the road. I'll be there soon. Buddhism is our way, war is not our way! Zindabad! Zindabad! Stop the police brutality. Move it, driver! What? A driver? - Then what? Should I call you "collector"? If I drove my own car, would you call me a driver? Doesn't your license carry the word 'driver', too? Zindabad! Zindabad! Jai Bhim! Zindabad! Zindabad! Zindabad! No money for food, clothing and shelter, but you spend for tanks on fortresses? He's going to kill you. It's no exhibition. Get to work! Alibaba, won't you handle this? Why are you lazing around at the shop? Hello. I told him the lorry needed service. Don't go in there now. He won't spare you. Wait a while. They're killing me. I just can't manage these idiots. Keep to your left... Don't go to your right! What's this? Come, come, come... What are you looking at? You've done your bit. Who cares if my property is damaged? No, Boss. The glass was already broken. Don't give me that crap. You've ruined my morning. Even if I say something, you will only justify it. What's this? How to run my business if there's a 100 kg loss in each load? I invested ten lakhs in the shop last year. Where did it all go? I'll deduct it from your salary. Alibaba, write down 2,140 rupees on his account. And 4,000 for the broken glass. No mercy for him. Good enough. Hold on! I already told you, there is a discrepancy between our weight and the company's. They're cheating us. If you don't trust me, come see for yourself. I'll beat you with my slippers! You steal from the load and blame it on the company? You think he's broke, to steal? You would rob my shop blind if I didn't watch out. Leave some behind for your poor boss. I will need it to return to my hometown after you wipe me out. Don't blame it on the company! It's the Bhai's bill. He said he'd come tonight for his payment. Velu... don't go off to sleep. We need to weigh some load. - Okay. Alibaba, we need to weigh the load. Answer the damned phone. It's ringing off the hook. Selvam! Give him a hand, we're due for a delivery. I've been up driving all night. My eyes are droopy. I must sleep now if I'm to drive tonight. Ask someone else. What's with your night and day? Everyone else drives, too. Look at Velu... he drives at night too. Hari drives at night, too. Is he dead? You have just started here. Your father drove here for 15 years. He's never refused any work, not once. When that lorry was first bought, your father drove it to the mosque. How did he give birth to 'you'? Other drivers manage to pass off even garbage as iron. But you have brought this load back. You don't have money for the next meal, but you pick and choose jobs? Get lost. I spoke to Bhai about the lorry. He said we should just buy a new one. So I told him, this lorry was driven by his father. He believes that his father lives in it. True. If my father got sick, an injection could make him better. If I pitched in money and got him fixed, he'd perform just fine! If the boss found out that you're planning to buy his lorry... he'd tell the whole world you robbed him enough to buy his own lorry! Watch out. I'll buy my own lorry, take it for a spin, blow out exhaust smoke on his face and Chittu's family too... or I'm no son of Veeramuthu's. He calls me a thief when I ask for my salary? - Be quiet. What's that idle chatter? Get to work. He's talking about you. Throw it! Come out here, boss man! What's with you? It hurts! I'm hurt! Lift him up! We must take him to a private hospital. - Why private hospital? Stop! Why private hospital? It's not like his leg got chopped. Take him to a government hospital. Keep this. Take the money! Why are so many of you going? Just one companion will do. Others, get to work. Let's go, quick! Drive fast! - Be careful. Bloody nuisance! Stay by his side. I'll park the vehicle. Driver! Where did he go? Is this your vehicle? You've parked it on the way like you're a doctor? You're causing public nuisance. - Don't talk too much! I was struggling to lift him, did you help? You just stood and watched. Damn you and your rules. Do what you can. There is blood all over your vehicle. It looks disgusting. Quit talking and move the vehicle. So you're that public? Move that vehicle! - Dare to touch me? That's someone's blood. Think of the pain. You find it disgusting? Comrade, you came with him? He's lost a lot of blood. You have just wrapped a cloth on it. You have no conscience? And you're picking a fight here. We must speak to the management. Come with me. They always behave this way. Let it go, Comrade. Do what you can. I'll just have a word with him. Comrade... Maybe this is new to you, but we're used to it. You should see our iron scraphouse. Everyone's bandaged. One person's arm, another's leg, or his head. Many have lost their limbs. Many have lost their lives. Do they get compensation or insurance? Compensation? The only compensation we get is the bus fare to our home towns. Those of us who don't own land migrate to cities for jobs. Even if we don't send money back home... imagine their plight if we go home with an arm or leg missing? Divided, you can't do anything. These days, there are unions. Union? Which TV channel are you from? We're not from any TV channel. We are documentary filmmakers. Oh, about Coca Cola harming River Tamirabarani? People were told not to watch that movie. Isn't that the one? I know. That's been the newspaper headlines. Aren't you a driver? How do you know all this? You think I'm stupid because I'm a driver? Ask me any news from the past decade. I can give you the date. You name the news magazine, I've read it. I read every joke. Really? 'You' read jokes? One more tea? It's Constable Munusami. One moment, Comrade. Hello? - I've been trying to reach you since yesterday. A bomb washed ashore last evening. What? Really? I had kept it in the station. Now it's gone missing. From the police station? The head constable Rudran who was in the news for hitting me...? He has thrown it away to make me look bad, and claims it was just a pipe. I'm in Chennai now. Are you on duty? - Yes, hurry up. They are arresting the comrades before giving them treatment. See you. I'll see you later. It just won't crack! What are you doing? I'm separating the brass from iron. Fool, how will you do it manually? There's a welder right here. Give it to him for welding. Okay. - Here you go, Mohan. What did the boss say? He wanted you to weld it. You think I'll forget, then you can steal it? 2kg brass is worth 600 rupees! I'll tell on you to the boss. Puncture, stop bugging me. First plough out all the dregs on it, then I'll do it. Or I could lose an eye. Oh, shall I wash it with soap as well? It's getting late. Get your gun, now! No, let's not... I'm right here, just do it. Yes, go on. Won't you shut up? Move back! You're telling 'me' off? ISI certified Priya TMT Bars. Strong and reliable. You're drinking yourself to death, just like your father! We are the iron bars! We just toil here for him, father to son, with no time for our family. We are the strong and reliable iron bars! I will kill him right here in his shop. He thinks he's above questions? I will question him! You are drunk. Why are you starting a fight here? Just go to sleep. You're elder to me. I respect your words. Sister, there is only one difference between you and me. Tell me. - What's that? You're a man. I'm a woman. Is that it? You're sober and I'm drunk. You don't even know this? Jerk! Let me go! Come out here. You cheat! Get out here, boss. Let him go. What do you want? Why are you pulling me back? Want me to play dumb like you people? I'm Veeramuthu's son! You think being Veeramuthu's son makes you somebody? You get drunk and cause a ruckus here? He's fighting for justice? Bloody moron. Stand back. Let me go. I've not come here to fight. I've come for justice. Who is the thief here? What justice? He's losing so much blood, you ask me to drop him off, am I an animal? Would you say that if it was your child? You asked why we drove too fast? Do you have a tiny piece of cotton in this shop? The doctor said he could have lost his leg. If he loses his leg, his wife and children can live off your 50 rupees forever? I've seen so many men in this shop, without an arm or a leg. We want to get back home alive. When that life is in danger, even a cycle will fly, like an ambulance. The speed is not in the vehicle... it's in here. I'll smash your face in. - I'm prepared for anything. Now, we don't have to beg you. Our union will. Understand? OUR UNION WILL STAND UP FOR US. What? A union? Shut up. You're talking about a union here? A union for a scrap metal shop? Listen up, everybody. Don't let him convince you to join any union, or I'll fire you. Bloody daily wage worker... think I'm terrified of unions? If you're not scared, why are you running away? Who's running away? I'll make you run. Come here. He hit my head with a bottle. Hit you with a bottle? You dare to raise your hand? Settle his accounts, and send him away. You don't need to work here anymore. Selvam, listen... He's fired you a hundred times and you've quit a hundred times. Keep quiet, sister. - Don't do this. Sir! Who do you think you are? I'll smack you. You retired 6 months ago. You still put on a uniform to take bribes. Why are you paying a bulb with no fuse? You see now who's the thief? You see now, who's the real thief? Chittu! - Hello? Chittu, boss called me a thief. Are you drunk? - I'm giving you two choices: I'll speak to the boss and then speak to you. Or speak to you and then speak to the boss? You'll be out on the streets from tomorrow. Keep that in mind. Look, I didn't want to say this. But now you've made me. Your father, too, fought with me and left. You know what happened within a year of his leaving? Get out of my sight. Or I'll kill you. When my father worked here, this shop was just a tent. How is your life now? Your wife and children? But my father was a daily wager, so am I. You have sucked the life out of us. Here, don't leave this behind. I will make my father's wish come true. I'll come here with my lorry and blow out the fumes on your face. Got your bags, like the boss said. - Puncture, you rat! You're always ratting on us. I'll kill you today. I'm Veeramuthu's son. You'll be out on the streets from tomorrow. Look, I didn't want to say this. Your father, too, fought with me and left. You know what happened within a year of his leaving? You must study hard, become a great man. You must comfortably drive around in a car. And buy your father his own lorry. Your father will drive it around, have fun playing with your children... and live with you till I die. Maybe it wouldn't hurt so much elsewhere. To see his lorry in this shop everyday... I feel like I have pawned off my dad, you know. I should buy this lorry soon, somehow. We should buy our own lorry... with our son's name painted on the front... I will come driving it into our hood. Our people are going to be stunned. 'The black stallion comes-a-trotting; The trot that traverses bygone times.' 'Anklets adorn his stout legs; Spreading fear with the groove of his hooves.' 'Glimmering embers flying in the air; Deafening rhythm of the parai drums blare.' 'Here comes the legend of Siruvaalai!' 'Behold the light!' 'Behold our people's guiding light; The mighty armoured knight!' 'Behold the light!' 'Behold our people's guiding light; The mighty armoured knight!' 'Are these winged embers in my sky? Are these fiery flowers flying high?' 'How it purges the darkness out, my love!' 'Are these golden rays of light? Are these tiny bits of day in my night?' 'How is it my West is East now, my love?' 'Behold our people's guiding light; The mighty armoured knight!' 'Behold our people's guiding light; The mighty armoured knight!' 'A million stars float in my river at night; My crazy heart swims against the tide.' 'The sweetness of your flame; The strangeness of this fever.' 'To bloom and wither within the pond; Is my femininity delicate as a lilly bud?' 'Standing tall in these waters; Won't I emerge victorious in our wars?' 'Behold our people's guiding light; The mighty warrior of the land!' 'He who labours for love!' 'Behold the light!' 'The blue of the lovely skies; Bleeds into the flame for us.' 'How I long to feel your soul bleed into mine!' 'Look at the blossomed victory flowers; They say it's time we break our fences.' 'How the floral breeze caresses my hands!' 'Little drops of light dance in the dew; Like the terms of love between me and you.' 'Our first breath of life; Our love is our right.' 'A towering flame is ablaze; It will expunge the darkness of centuries.' 'The moment you and I become one; The Earth rotates in a new direction.' 'Are these winged embers in my sky? Are these fiery flowers flying high?' 'How it purges the darkness out, my love!' 'Are these golden rays of light? Are these tiny bits of day in my night?' 'How is it my West is East now, my love?' 'Behold our people's guiding light; The wielder of the lightning lasso!' 'Behold our people's guiding light; The brave, lasso wielding illuminator!' 'Behold our people's guiding light; The mighty armoured knight!' 'Carrying the wrath of past generations, He comes marching for his comeuppance!' 'Behold our people's guiding light; The mighty armoured knight!' 'Behold our people's guiding light; The mighty armoured knight!' Sir, a metal object was washed ashore and brought into this police station. Can I know details about what it could be? The public are saying strange things. Like what? Don't get angry. We're just asking for information. For the local magazine Mallai Malar... Oh. Mallai Malar? We handed it over to the DSP's office last evening. We can't comment till the investigation is over. One last question. In your opinion... what could it be? Not just my opinion, but also my superiors'... it's probably a part of an old shipwreck. Do you have any photos of the object? Let's print a small box in a corner. I'll tell you if we get one. Will you take this load? No, it's not my thing. I'm not great at driving even the smaller vehicles. Why is the lorry standing there? Haven't sent the load out? One of our men is hurt. And this guy refuses to drive big vehicles. What can we do? Selvam is here. I said I didn't ever want him here. You didn't settle his accounts and send him away? He thought we can't do anything if he gets drunk and creates a scene? He said he's starting a union? Thinks it will scare me? Look, if you let him stay, he will teach all this to all the boys. Send him off in the morning. Basha, listen to me. It will take a week for Velu to get better. It's the festival season. We have heaps of load. If we call a temporary driver everyday, it will cost 1000 rupees extra. I'll bring him to you, just reprimand him. Don't overthink it. Send him with the load. Comrade, a bomb has come ashore at Mamallapuram. It was taken to the police station. And it has gone missing now. But they claim it's something else. Should I look for the bomb or get bytes from scholar? Comrade, it's easy. It's the bomb we're struggling to find. We will lose credibility if we make allegations without the evidence. I'll take a byte from him after the seminar. The bomb is our priority. Okay, Comrade. Velu... I've decided not to work for them. This is my last load. - Yeah, right. This is his last load as a driver. After this, he will drive as a proud lorry owner. I know your plan. He's even going to a temple. I got drunk and fought with her, right? So she's upset. She said not to call, that she's going to the temple with family. I'll handle my sweetheart. Wait and see how. How? I'll stand in the crowd. She will get stunned when she sees me suddenly! No matter how much we fight over the phone, she'll come running into her man's arms. Then marry her. She is ready. But I have this fear inside. What fear? My father lost his father at a very young age. Then it happened to me. What if the same thing happened to my son, too? Don't talk rubbish. No such thing will happen. I assure you, you will buy that lorry. We have the blessed Bhai on our side. Eat up now. You didn't eat lunch? Oh, no. My eyes are burning. I haven't slept in three days. If I eat now, I'll fall asleep behind the wheel. I'll eat on my way. You never listen to me. Manager Ali Bhai called. Come with me. Should we all come? - Not you, him. Brother Selvam! - Yeah, I'm coming. 'I have become a sinner, With no talent for ruling the world.' 'I have become too gentle, Braiding five-coloured weaves.' Just click a picture of him selling stolen iron and send it. Okay, Boss. I'll have him locked up and make you a driver. Hold this. Bless me, Boss! You're one of our own, afterall. Give me that. I'm a driver! Take care. Puncture, remember what I said. Look sharp. Don't want even a 100 gm iron going missing. Thieves, all of them. They'll eat me alive if I falter. Stay vigilant. I hate the look of him. Selvam, make sure he never returns here. I don't want to see his face. I'll handle it. You take care. Look at him. Eaves-dropping on us. The owner will be upset. He will take me to task... Let's get going, quick. Hold on! Wait, don't weigh it yet. - Okay, okay. I want to keep an eye. When the lorry is set on the weighing scale, stay close to the lorry. Watch like a hawk. Just transport this load without any loss in the weight, and I'll make you a driver. If you look away for even a second, he will steal something. Remember that. Stay vigilant. Not even the tiniest speck will go missing. Go ahead, weigh it. How much? Shall leave. Let's go! Always on the phone... I will straighten you out in the morning... Two girls came enquiring after it. She had glasses on? - Yes. It's unlikely that a thief will sell a stolen property here. Look for it elsewhere. You said she's just a local reporter... and it won't be a problem. Look what's happened now. Her name is Tanya. She studied Mass Communication in JNU. She has worked in national news agencies. She's a bold girl. She has taken part in student protests too. There's an international news channel called Al Jazeera... she works for it. It's a deadly channel. The project she is working on is about my company. Now she's filed a Right to Information. No, sir. Her activities did not seem suspicious at the time. She's smart. You got fooled. We can lock her up for good, if you want. Or, something else... My foot. They will decide when to wipe her out. First, try to destroy the evidence. Find the bomb. I will choose who dies, and when. Just tell me whether or not you can do this by morning. Sports a moustache like a man, but gets nothing done. No point in trusting these cops anymore. You should follow her. Hack into her system. Extract all the data. Then I will tell you whether or not to kill her. If she connects her device to a public WiFi... within ten seconds, I can extract all her data. Knowing that 10 - 20 men could die at any moment... how could the police live in peace after misplacing the bomb? I'm going to post this on Facebook. Don't get carried away, Sugi. Our objective is not just to call out the police. They may be the cause for the bomb going missing. But whom do we blame for it not being known as a bomb? The government decides that the public are harmed... by pickpockets and bikers without helmets. We need a byte from the German lady. Most importantly, we need the bomb. More than 30 workers were killed due to an explosion in an iron factory in Gummidipoondi. Over 100 people who were injured have been admitted to a hospital. Let's go. Call up Constable Munusami. That was our last evidence. The evidence is gone, what will we do with a photo? We'll frame it. Don't get me worked up! Did this explosion lead to so many deaths in Gummidipoondi? I'm sure it wasn't this bomb. This one would have wiped out the entire area. Of all the bombs dropped on Germany during both the World Wars... it is said about 40,000 unexploded bombs remain buried under the ground. In Germany when someone applies for a bank loan to build a house... they must produce a certificate stating there are no bombs in the area. When they dug up an area near my place to build a house... one such bomb was found. People in my city... within 10 km radius were evacuated before the bomb was extracted. I have failed to understand one thing. Our country was in war, and hence there are bombs. But in a country where there was no war... in areas commonly frequented by the public... these bombs being washed ashore is very scary. Let's eat. Don't say I didn't ask. Puncture, he will offer you liquor and food. Don't give up on your dreams of becoming a driver over that! I won't eat at odd hours and waste the boss's money. You've come with me. How could I leave you behind and eat alone? Just come to give me company. - No, I won't. Damn, man. Suit yourself! The accounts! Since you insisted... shall I eat one parotta? Eat up! One portion of parotta! Yes, serve me! Just one more parotta... Leave me alone, my neck hurts! Do you ever send money home or do you spend it all on food? All this air was inside my stomach. I was a fool to think my stomach was full. I'm the fool here. Do you know the bill amount? You said one parotta, but you've cost me the price of three meals. We're going to starve tomorrow. Don't you dare close your eyes to sleep in the lorry. I'll whack your head so hard, it will get punctured. I will steal iron when you fall asleep. - No, I won't fall asleep. Sir... His name is Aruppu. He steals at a different place every single day. I don't know where he is now. Did he come to the station yesterday? Sir, this happened at night. But he came to the station during the day. That doesn't matter! He must have dumped it in some scrap shop. Find out where he normally sells. Okay, sir. He must be picking scraps somewhere around here. Time to take action on Aruppu! Is Aruppu home? - No, sir. He never comes home. The police were just here and I told them the same thing. We found the CCTV footage. It was Aruppu who took it from the station. Okay, sir. I'll get it done. Hurry up and find him before we do. It's important that you do. Dude, I'm sending you a number now. Yes, track the number. Is this Aruppu's house? He must have gotten sloshed somewhere. Don't know where he is. He never comes home. Why are you troubling me? Come, Chithra. Why do you always get angry? Come. This won't take very long. We're only going to a temple. It's a good thing. Everything you pray for will come true. Come. Chithra, go with your brother. I'll load the grains and come. Get going, fast. Don't wait for me. You get started. -Okay, Father-in-law. I'll get there soon. - Okay, sure. Let's leave? - Bye. All the lorries head towards Pondicherry. On rare occasions, a couple of them go to Gummidipoondi. The police came and enquired a few times, too. I haven't told them anything yet. But I trust you. Aruppu came and dropped some goods off. I wasn't at the shop then. I sent half the load to the Kalpaakam merchant. And another half to Basha's lorry. Since the Gummidipoondi explosion... all the lorries have headed towards Pondicherry. Okay, thank you. What's this place? I'll tell you. Let Father come I won't come without him. He's on the way. - No, I'm not coming. Chithra, listen to me. - No, Sumathi. I'm not coming. Just come. - Let me go. Why are you being so difficult? Hurry up. What took you so long? I won't come any further. Just listen to us. -What's all this? It's for your good. Here, Priest. - Keep it there. Chithra! Sit. - What are you doing? It's true that this girl is cursed. Make the girl lay this garland on the holy trident, take her to the temple spring, make her go around it thrice, then she must do three sit-ups in atonement, splash her with the water, and we shall begin the ritual. Here is the garland. No, You do it. - Put it around the trident. Get up! Do it. - I won't. Get up! - No. Do it. Sumathi! Come. We sent you to college to study. You want a man, do you? You shouldn't be allowed to live. Just drop dead, you witch. I'm going to sleep. What about you? I'll stay in the lorry. Suit yourself. I've seen many spies like you. All of them have left in tears. I will watch you cry, too. This is my last trip. I'll buy my own lorry... marry Chittu... and blow out fumes on all your sorry faces. I'm going to catch you red-handed. Damn you! They have sent it without removing the brass. He'd have to go past me to steal. You've moved up from iron scraps to brass scraps? Let me see how you steal this brass tonight. Hello? Hello, Selvam? I called you so many times. I've been in so much trouble since we spoke this morning. They took me to a priest and tried to kill me. I've run away from them. I'm at the Villupuram bus stand sitting in a Madras bus. Stay on that bus. Get the conductor to drop you at the toll gate. I'm very scared, Selvam. Where are you? Don't worry. I'm on my way there. Don't be scared. I'll get there before you. I caught you! The brass... costs 300 rupees per kg. Puncture! Brother, this is my last delivery. My father lives in this lorry. This is my last delivery, ever. Please don't do this to me. Hello, Chittu? - Hello? I'm near the toll gate. I'm standing near the barriers on the road from Villupuram. You? - Do you see a scrap lorry? Where? I'm there. I see you. Come soon! I'm coming. Always obsessed with Chittu. He never lets me sleep. Puncture, get on to the lorry. So this is your Chittu? Where the hell did you go? 'The dark skies of the night... They glow to show us the light.' 'While the stars shine down; We are never alone.' 'A brand new dawn, a brand new era beckons' 'I lost my loneliness in this beloved blackness' 'Like a river flowing from the mountain; I found my way to you, My Ocean!' 'In the shade of my man's embrace; I bloom like a lotus.' 'This love... it hit us unawares; Our love will protect us.' 'Oh, our love... It will emend; Our love is all we need!' 'So hold me, my love. Take me!' 'Bathed in the chilly moonlight; I'm warm, with you by my side.' 'As this light fills our souls; We become one as we evanesce.' 'This love... It is progress; It will change the old ways.' 'Oh, our love... It will wipe our woes; It will purge our sorrows.' 'So be mine, my love; Be mine, forever.' 'The dark skies of the night... They glow to show us the light.' 'While the stars shine down; We are never alone.' 'This twinkling beauty of the galaxy; Tells the story of you and me.' 'When we opened our hearts; We unlocked bolted doors.' 'My quest ends here; I found my shore in you, my dear.' 'You can lean on my shoulders; Unload your sorrows.' 'So tie the knot, my love; It's you and me against the world.' 'The dark skies of the night... They glow to show us the light.' 'While the stars shine down; We are never alone.' 'A brand new dawn, a brand new era beckons; I lost my loneliness in this beloved blackness.' When I become a driver, I should ask the boss for an elevator in this lorry. Such a pain to climb up and down. Once we weigh the load, things are going to change. You'll be the cleaner, and I the driver. [Speaking Hindi] You think I'm a thief? You fool! Get out. Messing around right in the morning. I was cautious throughout. How did this happen? How much? It's 250 kg less. Puncture, you're so dead. Hop on! When I come on my own, I'm usually only 100 - 150 kg short. You came with me and now we're 250 kg short? Now you know our plight? Why don't you call him now? [Speaking Hindi] Come here. Quick, lift the goods. Quick. Don't use magnets to unload the goods. I'll take a shower and come. Selvam, what do I do now? You've done everything wrong. Basha will welcome you with gifts. What did I do, Selvam? Driver to driver, help me out. You consulted him on every little thing. Talk to him now. Is this the time for revenge? We shared parottas, man. You got so many people fired. Now you'll see. Hello? - Boss, it's me, Subbiah. Tell me, sir. Do you need a vehicle for hire? Sir? Did I call the wrong number? It's me, Subbiah. Subbiah Swami. Which Subbiah Swami? Who is this? Subbiah. It's me, Puncture. Fool! Why can't you tell me your name? Subbiah Swami, it seems. Subbiah Swami is the name that my parents gave me... Tell me. The weighing system in this company is not right. Not just ours, the weight appears lesser for all the lorries. What? All the lorries? A bad workman blames the tools! I sent you there for this? - You can come and see for yourself. I should come and see? You've become a sell-out too? You ate some biryani, drank some booze, slept on my account, and now you blame the weighing system? Don't you come back and face me. Jump into the sea and die. No, I promise! -You are not becoming a driver! Bloody thief! I'll call you back. So, Puncture? What did the boss say? Nothing much. It's alright, tell me. Tell me. Like I said... He asked if I was eating and sleeping well. Just tell me what he said. - I told you. He asked if I was eating... -Ha ha ha... What did he say? He told me to jump into the sea and die. Come on! You're crying for this? This is just another day in our lives. Puncture, there is no family or bonding in this world. It's all about money. Don't be scared. Let's go. He is your boss, too. I trusted him. I was alert as a snake and brought him all this iron. He called me a thief! Let it go. Hope you understand now. What's the teacher saying, sister? We were just talking. Hello. Okay, Selvam. I've got work. I'm off. What, son? Think you're here on a picnic? You haven't made any preparations? The girl came to you, so you will use her and get rid of her, is it? Velu has made all the preparations. They are on the way here. This time tomorrow, we shall get married in Nagapattinam. Okay, come in. Look at this. What's all this? Who gave it to you? That lady gave it to me. All the Tamil and Hindi workers had pooled in money and bought this. When the garland is here, we will marry in the temple under the Neem tree. All my friends say... after the wedding... What did they say? Idiot! I haven't finished. My mother is a pain, you're a bigger pain. I can only do a job I know. Can't you see how I'm good at it? Take it from me. We will never go to your family asking for anything. Isn't that good enough? I will not leave you alone and die off. I want to see my grandchildren before I die. I believe you. Still... when they show these accidents in TV news... though it's not you, I still feel... very restless till I call you up and hear your voice. Because of you, I've stopped watching TV, you know. Selvam! Yes, brother? - The manager wanted you. I'll be right back. Why? He said it's important. Come soon. You get ready, I'll be back. Sir... Sir, why have you brought me here? Show that to him. What's that? What? What is it? You push all these wretched things on my head. So that I go to jail? Take it back. Don't keep saying it's not from your lorry, or that you didn't bring it. It doesn't count as iron? Open your eyes and see! It's a bomb! A b... bomb? The bomb that explodes? - Obviously. Velu brought half the load. I'll ask him. I'll speak to him... Let me speak to him, sir. You call one person... and he'll call another. The news will spread and eventually the police will seal my company shut. There are 400 families dependent on this company. Brainless oaf. Do you read the papers? The police have been here thrice since morning. You want me to go to prison? Let me go, explain to him. Selvam, don't you read the papers? It's a bomb! What if had exploded, like the one in Gummidipoondi? Only a few people died there. More than a hundred would have died here. You'll spend a lifetime in prison. - Why me? My boss can go to prison. Yeah, right. They have shut down three companies so far. Which boss went to prison? Your boss won't be affected. Fools like you and me will end up behind bars. What have you got to lose? I sold my land, hustled for cash and brought a 200 labourers from Orissa. If they die, what will we live off? Here, take your phone. That thing has left our company property. It should never come in again. That's your problem from now. Handle it. Just like nobody knew how it got in... it should leave without anybody's knowledge. Send him off. Puncture! You fool, he's calling you. Come here. I said, come here. I parked outside. - Idiot! Velu called me. Apparently, a piece of iron he had put aside, was loaded in to our lorry by mistake. Do as I say. When you get out, you will see a heap of grains, and a grove next to it. I've left it there, go bring it. Careful. Heap of grain, inside the grove? Hurry up. Chithra is waiting. He wants the brass for himself. I am going to tell the boss. Why go to him? I'll open it myself. Selvam! Selvam! Selvam! Let me go! Selvam! Don't spare him. Kill him. Let me go! Selvam! Selvam! Selvam! Selvam! Puncture! Selvam! Let me go... I killed you Puncture! Are you hurt, son? Tell me, son. I'm okay. But the idiot who worked with me as a cleaner... I didn't tell him the truth. I got him killed. Son, please don't cry. Think of me like a father... Why should I be alive? - Listen to me, son. I should die, too. -Listen. Why is he crying? One of his friends died. So he's weeping. - Oh no, Selvam... Who died? Don't cry. Listen to me... Fool! Moron! Mongrel! Where did you go? I was so scared. Idiot. Where did you go? Is this your friend? He was crying over you all this time. Even one's family wouldn't cry so hard. He was so upset. - Where is it? Get out of here now. Go away. Tanya, it says make a right here. Comrade, how do I get to Madukarai Iron Factory? Go straight... and you will reach a junction. Make a left there. Tea, sir. SI Sankar from Mamallapuram. Is this Pondicherry Signal? Over. Yes, sir. Madukarai signal, sir. Sir, please follow the signal. - Okay. Look at me, girl. Look at me. Open your mouth and say something. Oh no, what has he done! - What happened? What happened? He hanged himself. Get him down carefully. Get here, quick! Bring him water! Come, quick. How could you think of deserting your children? How can you even think this way? She won't stop till we end up on the streets. Do you think this is fair? Is that family any match for us? You have had your way. We shouldn't have given you so much freedom. Are you happy now? If your brother dies, who will support his orphaned child? Uncle, looks like you will kill him even if he makes it! Did I hand him the rope and ask him to kill himself? Would someone really try to hang himself when the entire family is around? Fine, you beat me up and dragged me back this time. What will you do if I run away after marriage? This ends now. You've really spoiled this girl by being soft on her. She should either obey me, or die. What is your problem? Either you live, or I live. What do you think of yourself? You want me to become a widow? Tell me, what's wrong with you? You are causing us so much pain. You have only brought us shame. I was carrying this piece of iron.. and there was all this smoke coming from the car. So I wanted to help the guy, driver-to-driver... and went to bring water from the motor room... Just a teeny explosive... how powerful it was! What a loud bang! My ears started ringing. And I just ran... Didn't turn around till I was in a different town. You're driving rash, Selvam. Shall I--? Shut up! Don't turn your head so fast... Look... No one has considered me a living being until now. You cried so hard when you thought I was dead. You have a place in my heart. From now, you, sir, are my Guru-ji. Can I be your disciple? Guru-ji? - Chittu! Selvam, I'm the watchman from the recycling company. The Tamil Nadu police are showing a picture of that bomb... and questioning the company staff. Don't get caught with it in your lorry. Your route is the Tamil Nadu - Pondicherry border. The check-post will be on high alert. Be careful, guys. Guru-ji, we can pull over if you want to talk. Where are you? - You fool, what is it? Dude, don't worry. Just bring it here. I'll take care of it. I'll just leave the lorry out here and be on my way. What can you do? I am going to do that. If you leave the lorry there, who will keep an eye on it? Ask Nagaraj to pick it up on his way. He gets worked up over nothing. If he finds out about the bomb, that's the end of us. The Bhai has been very helpful to us. We can't lose our temper and get him into trouble. Just do me this one favour... The police are on the look out. What do I do with a bomb? I'll wait for ten minutes, no longer. Don't shout, man. Puncture can't find out. He doesn't know that it's a bomb. Don't-- It's a bomb? To hell with you! Velu, may your feet never step on the clutch again! May your leg never heal. I curse you! May you never get married! Puncture, don't go there. - You will remain single forever. The police are after us? Wait, I'll call the army here. You tried to kill a driver with this giant bomb? Ask Bhai to call immediately. Puncture, please don't tell Basha Bhai. Why would I tell him? I'll tell the military. You said you'd obey my every word. Not anymore. Your Guru-ji commands you. Listen up! No! What's there to think? We have seen it all. Get her married, and she'd stay put. My sister-in-law ran away twice, too. I dragged her back home, got her married, now she is a mother. Just say the word, and we shall get her married discreetly. And you have a groom ready right here. I've got no money. I need a couple of months. I can't plan anything until the next harvest. You give this excuse all the time! Didn't we get our eldest married too? Didn't we spend on a lavish wedding, and the dowry? Didn't the entire village attend it? Are we hiding our wealth and refusing to spend. Go ahead and plan this, Uncle. We will get her married. Don't care if she lives or dies. He will always talk like this. You go ahead and plan this. Okay, sure. Cheers! So, Guru-ji... if this bomb goes off, then we will explode to a million pieces with the lorry? Oh no... No, it will shove us out of the way... and go straight to Pakistan before exploding. Do you know why? - Why? Because this is our country's bomb. It won't kill us. So that country's bombs won't explode there? Is that why we throw bombs on each other, to make it work? Looks like it. Why don't we take this bomb to your lover's brother... and smash it on his head? Bhai, you didn't answer my calls? Selvam, Velu called me. Your location is too far from our shop. It will take a long time to reach. What if the police seize the lorry before another driver reaches? Did Velu tell you that we discussed about your lorry? I will handle your dues with Basha Bhai. That lorry is yours. You only care about your work. You don't care if I die as long as your job gets done. You're a boss too, afterall. They took my wife away, you know? Velu mentioned it. I should be there for her. I'm stuck here. There are so many checkposts between Pondicherry - Tamil Nadu border. Send another driver, Bhai. I'm done. Son, you are angry now. So you will misunderstand everything I say. You will be catching a bus from Panrutti? Here's what you do... bury it in an isolated spot on your way. -Bhai! Then get married, and come here. I will take care of you. Bhai, I need to go now! Won't you do this, for old times' sake? Okay, Bhai. Hang up now. Puncture, let's go. Get up! I'm not coming in the lorry. We'll get blasted to smithereens. Listen. - What? The lorry is like my father. He will watch over us. Lorry, why are you swaying? Are you drunk too? Guru-ji... How about I chew this bomb out like a bone, and spit it out? Just shut up. I have another idea. Watch. It's gone soggy now. It's over. No more problems. Relax and drive on. It's the police! They've got no other work! - They are gone. Have they left? Pour me a round. Same cocktail. Dude! Why are you running? Get down - Sir! Sir! Walk! -Sir! Why are you hitting me? Sir, I just had one drink. Sir... How dare you rob us? Get in! You started stealing from the police station now? They caught him. What? - You watch out. I can't call you. They are right next to me. You don't need to call me again. Okay? Delete my contact from your phone. Okay, take care. Sugi, don't be here. Go to the seminar. - Okay, Tanya. Brother! Please stop for a minute. Is this the way to Panrutti? Panrutti? - Patootie! Panrutti, of course. - Oh, Panrutti? You have come 10 - 15 km beyond Panrutti. What happened? - Chithra is at her house. Are you sure? Did you get a close look? I did. Her grandma and aunt were crying. I think they were giving her some advice. I tried to get her to talk to you over phone... but her uncles looked at me suspiciously, so I just left. Don't worry, man. We are prepared to face anything. Call me if you need anything. - Okay, buddy. Is that the way? - Yes. Your face has lit up after the phone call. Chithra is at home. Is it? Are you always going to be so impatient? I've lived with that family for 20 years. Wouldn't I know how to run away from there? You don't even know how many rooms there are in my house. You'll come to my rescue? I know how to get out. You focus on getting there in one piece, boy. Who told you not to date a driver? That jack-ass friend? It's not a big deal to be a gentleman within four walls. Even in a four lane highway, I don't halt when I see sex workers. That's what matters. Next time you listen to your idiot friends and talk like I am a thief, not a driver... I'll cover your face with lorry fumes! I'm sick and tired of hearing that line again and again for so many years. Sweetheart... I have a question. You drive the lorry all night... and sleep all day. I work all day and sleep all night. How will it work out for us? If only the bomb had exploded when she was here, we'd have died together. Guru-ji, first you said it won't explode, now that you're sober you say it will? I speak the truth only when I'm drunk. Please speak only the truth. Will this explode or not? When we were kids, we would fight with the seller if a cracker didn't burst? Ever come across any news about a bomb that failed to explode? Those who splurge crores on these bombs, even they don't know... how am I supposed to know whether or not it will explode? Is there the slightest relevance between my question and your answer? Will this explode or not? Tell me that-- Is it our problem? Like Bhai said, let's just get rid of it somewhere. If we dump it somewhere, and it explodes, leading to tragedy, what then? If it happens, it happens. Let's be peaceful till then. Constantly worrying about when the damn thing will explode... whether the police will catch us... ...if Chithra is alright? All this makes me so anxious. If we bury it, we can go back peacefully. Puncture...it's the police. Guru-ji, let's ditch the vehicle and escape? Guru-ji, which way are you going? The police jeep is over there... Pretend to take a shit. No need to pretend. Where are they going? Phew! Guru-ji... the police have left. Puncture, do you smell jasmine? Yes... maybe there's a jasmine garden nearby. 'Enchanting jasmine blossom...' Puncture... Look down here. - Is it a treasure chest? Under your leg! My leg? It's a garland? Oh, no! You made me squat in a graveyard? I wonder where he'll take us next. Why did you stop, Guru-ji? Let's go. The bomb! - No, the police are over there. What all should I be scared of?! No, there are spirits there. - Spirits? It might explode! Why? Watch out... I am... Keep an eye behind you, too. I hear a vehicle. Go, check it out. Puncture, tell me. Puncture? Can't hear you... Puncture...? Puncture...? It's me. - What are you doing here? I didn't want to show my face to the vehicle passing by. Saw how I crawled stealthily like James Bond? I'll whack your head, Mr. Bond. Get up. - Get down to the ground! Fine, I'll get up. We'll get caught together. Come, Guru-ji. Careful! Slowly. Careful! Careful! It didn't explode! Guru-ji... Guru-ji... Watch it! What? Really, what? It's done for. It would be sodden and spoilt now. Is this some Made in China cracker that won't explode when wet? It's a bomb! It will explode even underwater. Lift it up. Careful! Come on, man! Let's just roll it. Must we carry it? Gently... Puncture, the bomb is facing you. Looks like no one comes here. Let's leave it here. I don't think even cattle come here. Can't you put it down gently? I told you so many times. Why would you do this, Puncture! Hand me the plough. Put it here. Be gentle. -Sorry. Puncture... It's done now. Bury it properly. The police! Who are you people? What are you doing here? - Run, run, run! Don't show them your face. - Guys, come here. Come quickly! Puncture, come faster... Stop! Puncture, we buried it near a school! Who cares, the police are behind us! Puncture, don't get caught. Run! Come on, Puncture! -Come on, guys Sir... Sir... Sir... sir, please let me go! Sir... sir! Please let me go! Sir! Sir, please let me go! What's this procession, madam? It's from a temple in the neighbourhood. They adorn the deity at the border and start the procession. Who are you both waiting for? You refuse to eat! Why don't you sleep here and leave in the morning? Are you the one who spoke to me over phone? Prof. Das sent you? 'Her scent wafts in the breeze...' I've been hearing your voice all these days... thought I'd come take a look. What do you want, woman? You will give me whatever I want? While performing the routine cleaning of weapons at Mamallapuram Police Station... a shot accidentally fired... leading to the tragic death of Constable Munusami. Munusami constable is dead. Sugi, come! Sure, sir. I will do it and then call you. I'm right here. I will handle it. All I want to hear is that she's dead. What's this place, Guru-ji? Look, there's a pond over there. I think I'll die panting for breath. Police! Keep driving. You're hiding here? Let me go! This is all your fault. Let me go! Tanya... Sugi, come on... Sugi... Barani! Barani! Tanya... - Hurry up, Sugi. We need to retrieve the bomb. - What happened? Insect bite you? Tell me! Stop scaring me, Guru-ji. Look... If you tell me to dig up the bomb again... you might as well tell me to stick my head under the wheel. Understand? The bomb is buried, now marry your girl, let me be a driver, take the lorry... What now? What happened? Tell me! The children... It's hard to watch an adult get hurt in a small explosion. This such a big bomb! What if it kills little children? My father swerved to avoid hitting a cow and ended up dying. When Chittu and I get married, and have a baby... everytime I see my child, I'll think of these children. Oh, God! Are you coming or not? So you want me to go back and dig... get caught by the police... and be imprisoned for life. Is that what you want, Guru-ji? Do you know who caused all of this? That wretched Boss! Think nice and hard... - You can stay back if you want. I'll bury it elsewhere. If someone comes here, shine this torchlight and give me a signal. Don't you touch the steering. Yeah, right. I'm terrified as it is. Go on, Guru-ji. As if I would drive. Bhai! - Is it you, Puncture? Yes, it's me. Selvam isn't there? We buried the bomb in a place like you told us to. Selvam has gone to dig it up and bury it in another spot. Don't bother! The person who sold it wants it back. Bring it to the shop. I spoke to Basha. He agreed. Tell him he can catch a bus from my shop. Hurry up. I have a lot of respect for you, or I should be swearing at you now. You tell us to take it away, then bring it back like it's a toy? It's a bomb! I'm crapping my pants already. Please listen to me. Wait, I'll go talk to him. Sir. Let me go. - You don't deserve any kindness. Let me go, sir. - Get in. Hello, Bhai. That was one long phone call! Why you! -Come here. You frightened me! What are you doing here? Don't shout! What are you doing here at this hour? What are you doing here? I came to take the load. We came in search of an object. We got into trouble with the police. They are trying to kill us. Please help us, comrade. An object? What's the object? Give me. Have you seen something like this in your load? No way. Never seen such a thing. We came to take a load of jackfruit. I'm waiting for the seller. Maybe I can ask around. Be careful on your way. - Guru-ji! Guru-ji! -Why is he shouting? Guru-ji! -Keep your volume down. Bhai phoned me. He asked us to dig up the bomb and bring it to him. Don't talk now. - Has he gone mad? Who is she? We will deliver our load and then come get you... Please, listen to me! - We need to go now... Where is that object? Please tell me. We have never seen such a thing. Isn't it obvious we know the truth? Why are you trying to fool us? You have no conscience? - Sugi, calm down. Comrade, please listen... Finding that object is a question of life or death for us. We don't know how long we have to live. These bombs have exploded in several places... and killed over 2,000 people. Over a 1,000 families have been orphaned, with no compensation. I'm one such orphan. They have tried to murder me 4 - 5 times. So many threats, so many blows... I took it all. And I continue to look for it. Because I don't want another orphan created in another explosion. If you find that object... it must weigh 70 - 80 kilos. if you make 20 rupees for a kilo... you will have 1,600 rupees. But if we get our hands on it... we will expose a 2,000 crore scam. Thousands of lives will be saved. Please help us out, Comrade! It's the last piece of evidence. To be human is to feel empathy for another human's pain. Do you need to experience it first hand to empathise? When will you people change? Come. You have put your lives on the line to save others' lives... you are a martyr, indeed. Even my Guru-ji wanted to dig it up because there is a school nearby. 100 - 200 children go to study here. But you say 1,000 - 2,000 could die? His wife has been taken away by her family, you know. We will dig up that bomb for you and leave, okay? Puncture, keep quiet. Don't worry. We have comrades in that town. I will help you out. That's the place. We buried it right here. Did it fall into the water? Puncture! Look over here. - Yes, Guru-ji. What? They have conducted a night ritual! Careful. We buried the bomb here. Here? It was right here. But it's gone now. The bomb is gone? Are you sure this is the place? They have performed the 'muppusa modi' ritual? Why did he come here? To offer prayers? Fool! To perform 'muppusa' means... it's a ritual where the people hide an object outside their village. The priest must find it. If he finds it, it is believed there will be rain in their village. It must definitely be at the festival. Let's check out this place first... to see if it's lying around somewhere here. Are you sure you buried it here? This could pose great danger. How could you take it so lightly? Sugi, I'll handle this. You go to the seminar. Please, you go ahead. I'll manage from here on. I'll be fine. Hello, Comrade. Comrade, I've spoken to our comrades in that village. Don't worry. They will handle it. I called you because it's an emergency. I'm on my way there. I'll call you once I reach. Okay, Comrade? - Okay. Chandrasekara Nayanar, when his workers didn't come to the farm, went to pray to their deity Iruchi instead, got enraged and tortured those poor people, and wrecked their temple. Upon hearing the helpless cries of its people subjected to cruelty, the deity Iruchi took a menacing form and descended with all it's might... to slay the cruel Chandrasekara Nayanar... ...as depicted in the following act. 'O Mother Iruchi! Our saviour...' 'She has descended upon this hostile land.' 'Supreme is her walk; Supreme is her talk.' 'Supreme is her heart.' 'Mother, your heart... It is supreme!' 'No matter what your prayer, No matter what your prayer...' 'To all your prayers, She will give you answers.' 'To cure those ailing from caste madness, To cure those ailing from caste madness...' 'Mother, take a human form; And descend down.' 'Rulers of our land; O Glorious Ambikai, O Majestic Maariyaatha!' 'Legends who walked this earth; O Madhavi, O Manimegalai!' 'O Mother Pidaari!' 'O Mother!' 'Mother, you are Selli, you are Ponni; You are Ariyamala, and Paapathiamma.' 'Our Mother, who set ablaze; In the form of Murugesan's Kannagi.' 'O Elavarasan's beloved!' 'You won over the hostile lands...' 'Now you have graced our lands, With your presence...' 'With every step you take, Oh, every step you take...' 'The old doctrines will burn to ashes!' 'Oh, burn to ashes.' 'With every step you take, Mother - Power-drunk humans get sober.' 'They will sober down; Yes, they will sober down.' 'With every step you take, Mother - Pride and arrogance will shatter.' 'Pride and arrogance will shatter; Yes, it will shatter.' 'With every step you take, Oh, every step you take...' 'With every step you take, Oh, every step you take...' 'With every step you take, Mother - You turn tar to treasure.' 'You turn tar to treasure.' 'With every step you take, Mother - You plant the flower of fairness.' 'The flower of fairness; Yes, the flower of fairness!' 'He gave birth, gave his last name; He gave birth, gave his last name...' 'He paid a dowry, To display his wealth.' 'Oh, it is sea-bound; It is sea-bound...' 'With all his might he restrained; But this river of love is sea-bound.' 'Freedom is wrong, my girl; Freedom is wrong...' 'With those honeyed words, He poisoned thoughts.' 'Those murderers, Those thieves!' 'They need to be slayed to smithereens; Your anklets tinkle menacingly.' 'May your floral breeze take them by storm; May your vermilion set them to flame.' 'Justice!' 'Bring justice to the world, Mother!' 'Bring justice to the world, Mother!' 'Bring justice to the world, Mother!' 'Hear the thunder rumbling? Hear the caste hierarchy crumbling?' 'Hear the thunder rumbling? Hear the caste hierarchy crumbling?' 'The whole town trembles in her might; Mother Iruchi's name gives Evil a fright.' 'Her sublime beauty is in her grace; Her sublime beauty is in her poise.' 'Her sublime beauty is in her grace; Her sublime beauty is in her poise.' 'Her sublime beauty is in her majesty; Even mountains bow down respectfully.' 'The dawn breaks at her command; The earth rotates to the show of her hand.' 'The dawn breaks at her command; The earth rotates to the show of her hand.' 'The fortress throws open doors for her; The feminine stands triumphant in this war.' 'The fortress throws open doors for her; The feminine stands triumphant in this war.' 'Her body commands respect, you shall abide; Her gait frightens lions, they run and hide.' 'Her body commands respect, you shall abide; Her gait frightens lions, they run and hide.' This has become usual with this guy. Where is the Iruchiamman temple? Guru-ji? What are you doing here? Guru-ji? I've been looking for you all over the village. You're sitting here watching him drink? I have good news for you, Guru-ji. First, I have news for you. Look at that sparkly brass thing. What? It's just a deity adorned. Look a little closely. That looks familiar... Oh, no! It's the bomb. Will he give it to us? What can we do? He's completely sloshed. Look, Priest. It's not that your blade scares me. I don't want you to shout. The boys in this village... wet their pants at the very sight of me. I dare them to look me in the eye. I will slaughter them, "chop-chop", and be on my way. They hid this metal thing just for me to find. I just carried it single-handedly! He's still drinking here? - I have nothing. I fear nothing. Before I die, I will find her a man. You will take her? Won't you leave me alone? I'll beat your face to pulp. The way she cusses, even your deity is cringing. Bloody shameless drunk, give that back to them. I earn money, so does she. There is nothing I can do. God has given everybody in the world one of those, and one of these. It's always hanging over our heads. It can't be prevented by anybody. Today, he gave it to me. Tomorrow, it could be you. Then, it could be him. This can't be prevented by anybody, either. At dawn today, I will slice this object... make a spade and a hoe, and throw away the rest. You can take it. Until then, sleep here. If we have our own means of production... we can go to work for anyone. What say? Look, Priest... You can't dig earth or cut anything with it... because this is a bomb. Oh, good. Puncture, let's give it to them. Lift it. Careful, Puncture. The police are coming. Let's go. Let's take this with us! Run that way! O Goddess Mahamayi.... Protector of the Universe! Our mother! The breaker of hurdles! Mother... Bless this world! Sir! The Goddess has seen us. The Goddess has Seen us, we will find the bomb now. We will surely find the bomb. Get lost! Forgive the ignorance of this sinner, Mother! Come on! I told you, they don't even know what this is. Let's go. The garland... Careful! Gently... Lift it evenly. Careful, Comrade. Watch it. Hurry, Comrade. We must take it to the Pondicherry University before the seminar ends. Puncture, go ahead and start the lorry. What? Start the lorry. Guru-ji, bless me. - What's with you? I feel blessed. Watch me drive. Come on. The police are close. Quick! Run! Quick... Careful... Come on! Careful, Guru-ji. Sir... Sir, there he goes. Get him. Come that way, sir. This way. - Careful! Get them. Run, run. Puncture, quick! - Let's go. The police are right behind us. It won't start. Damn you! It isn't starting, Guru-ji. Where should we come? The University Seminar Hall. VIPs and the media are all here. Okay, Comrade. They've caught up. Go faster. Faster. What the hell is going on? I'll get them, sir. I'm chasing them. Get the bomb. Or make it explode. Understood, sir. Switch to top gear. - Shut up! Make a right, Guru-ji. No, go straight. I think she watches too many movies. - Keep quiet. Go straight. Don't go straight. Please listen. Stop! You won't stay put? You're a dog that lives off my scraps. I kicked you down so many times. Why won't you back off? You go from town to town in search of garbage. You dare to court a girl from my family? Why won't you back down? You hit a woman? So much blood. So many lives. How much longer? How much longer do we live like this? Is this a fight between you and me? Someone's set out to kill us both. If that bomb explodes, even grass won't grow for 500 years. So much for your honour, prestige and pride. Palace or penniless, it's all the same to the bomb. We just want to live. You don't have to come along, but let us go. Selvam! Get down! Selvam! Selvam... Selvam! Get down! Get back! Die! I will take care of this. Go end it now. Guru-ji! Puncture! Comrade! What happened? We saw the documentary film made by Sugi and her team. Just watching the documentary makes our hearts race. Even at 90 years, he fights for a world free of war, and is a two-time recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize. Lauded as ambassador of world peace, we welcome the respected Mr. Yamaguchi as a special invitee to our conference. It gives me great pleasure to also welcome the Minister. Come! This is not his fault. Selvam! Step aside. Step aside, everyone. Don't go! What's the reason for his arrest? Chittu! All this time, we have struggled to expose this malfeasance around the bombs. But the police have arrested Selvam under false pretexts. Selvam did not do any wrong. If you let this be, each bomb in the sea... will become a toy in the hands of our children. Good morning all. I request Mr. Yamaguchi to deliver the final address of the conference. Greetings. 'All lives are equal at birth.' I wish to begin my speech with an incident from my life. I spent a lot of time away from my wife and daughter... while working as an engineer in a ship in Hiroshima. Once my contract was complete, and I went home to see my daughter, the nuclear bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. The city was reduced to rubble in no time. Lakhs of people melted and vaporised to death. I jumped into the river to save my life. The river was filled with corpses. Determined to see my daughter one last time... I set out to Nagasaki in a train filled with corpses. They dropped a bomb there, too. I starved for 111 days, and searched for my little girl among heaps of dead bodies. And then I found her. My two year old daughter had blood cancer from exposure to nuclear radiation. When she was in her death bed at ten years of age... a classmate of my daughter's told her that she would survive if she made a thousand paper cranes. Because of her strong desire to live, she made cranes with every piece of paper lying around, and hid them under her bed. She died after she made her 736th crane. We made the remaining cranes and buried my daughter with the cranes. Each hand that makes a paper crane... is building a mighty weapon against war. Let's look beyond our man-made borders of caste, creed and class. It will destroy the wars of the greedy people. In countries where crores of it's people live on one meal a day, reasoning that the only way to protect the nation is to spend many thousand crores on weaponry, is a big lie. No matter where a bomb is dropped, through air and through rain... the effects will spread to other countries, too. So instead of attempting to protect one country, we must think about saving the whole world. There might be several countries... but only one world. Joy to the world. 'Won't our generation awaken? Won't we right the wrong?' 'Won't we see the day we come together In this sacred earth, to end the war?' 'Won't liberation show us the way? Won't it be our guiding ray?' 'Won't this petty prejudice in human-kind of superior and inferior, come to an end?' 'We are children of the same motherland; May there be no intolerance.' 'We must rid our nation of this affliction; May no citizen feel the weight of discrimination.' 'Won't our generation awaken? Won't we right the wrong?' 'Won't we see the day we come together In this sacred earth, to end the war?' Dad? Ezhil darling. Come here. Have you eaten? What's your mommy up to? Are you bored? Let's go annoy her? Chittu, look who is here. Your uncles have come home to see us. Just wait and watch. Have they come pretending to bond with the child, just to slit our throats? Where are they? One must be wary, yes, but not this wary. You carry the broom around like a sword. Say no to arms at any cost, Chittu!
