It was just like that in 1942: Rommel's advance towards Alexandria, was inexorable. To the journalists he said: "The key to Alexandria is in my hand!" And Hitler swore: "Alexandria! You are MINE!" Stop acting like Clark Gable. We'll miss Tom and Jerry. 25.000 casualties in Kharkov. 2500 killed. To come early as all God's other creatures, would be below Victoria College. To hell with you! Kutchuk! D'you mind? He's our pal. Yes Kutchuk! You've started to smoke? Since two years! Yehia, have one! It's full of soldiers. Good we found seats. Why are you late? He was chatting up girls. That's the Australian who almost bashed your face. Let go of him! He's my pal. What's that ass saying? He doesn't like Egypt. We didn't invite him here. Your days are over here. Hitler's going to turn you into belly dancers. An ice-cream. There was a blond eyeing me. Cool it, man. I've got the blues and up above it's so fair Shoes, go on and carry me there I'll build a stairway to paradise With a new step every day With a new step every day Those Americans. Miracle workers! Top people of world. Today and forever! I saw the new Esther Williams yesterday. She's devastating. D'you think the Yankees will help us get rid of the British? Sure. If it's in their interest. Let's take a ride and pick up a girl. Now? In front of each other in the car? You can look away. I don't want to be looked at. I can't! Indeed you can't. Look who's talking! Britain and the U.S. are allies. Allies today, enemies tomorrow. Enemies today, allies tomorrow! Enemies today, allies tomorrow? That's fantastic. Where did you read that? Read it? I just thought it up now. What a repulsive subject. Shut up! I don't speak about sex. I just do it. But you guys are greenhorns. Let's chat up a chick. Drop it. I'd like to watch the film again. I missed a few things. Stop living in films. Let me teach you the way of all flesh. Here and not in Hollywood. You haven't drawn a card. Of course I did! You just don't see. Why are you screaming? I can't study with all of you bellowing. Instead of seeing the film twice, you should have come early. Card games can't be played quietly? We're locked up, stifled by those black-outs. Can't we have some fun? Just tell Albert to lower his voice. This is a respectable house. What is this? A queen, no? How many queens are there in a deck? I throw what I please! Sounds like a brawl. Turn off the lights. They've opened the window. Turn off the lamp. I won't! It's Morsi! He's at it again. May your heart stop beating, Morsi! Poor fellow... He looks like an angel. Angel? That's an aussie ass. The planes will spot us. Morsi, that monster, kept kicking his face. What's this, Salha? A jack. I just threw one. D'you expect me to throw a trump? I don't know what to do. Feel sorry when they're beaten up, or kill them when they ask for whores? We're living on top of a cabaret! How can they guess we're decent people? I love your pips, captain man! I love your uniform, captain man! Oh captain man. Oh captain! Why not wrap him for Adel Bey? Good brand. Adel Bey wants an officer from New Zealand. An officer! Isn't this the air raid alarm? You're right. It is. Yehia! An air raid! Hurry! There was no alarm. Your voice covered it, Salha! Almost killed us shouting about your silly jack. Take this sandwich and choke on it. Better than bombs. The bombs will only hit you. I want Halvah. Get it for him, Nadia. Can't it wait? Come on in, captain. Come in, you're crazier than your father! Play on, idiot! Inside. What do you do with all these bottles? Refill them with bathtub stuff? Do we look like moonshiners? With prices going so high, everyone hustles one thing or another. We have very good tyres. Need silk stockings for your lady? Straight Nylon. You're missing a deal. We need to get rid of the British. Believe it or not? You're my worst clients. I usually deal with "high life"... In a couple of minutes you'll see one. A bit wacky, but really "high". What does he buy? Tyres? No, man! Flesh and blood. He wants a New Zealand officer. New Zealand? To kill him... his idea of patriotism. Takes him to his mansion, then elegantly carves him. I tell you he's high class, man! Uncle Adel, a guy wants to see you. Astounding! I read about the general found dead under a tank. Real patriotism! What brought you here? Found you a pure breed officer from New Zealand. The fellows who have him, want a stiff price. I gave you fifty pounds. They want two fifties! One now, and the other one on delivery. Get me a hundred pounds. First promise to congratulate Chaker. Is this modesty? Or a change of ideology? Sarah Sorel coming to congrat- ulate the brand new pacha? Your sister is my friend. And Chaker, her husband. A friend to the workers you love. An urge to discuss politics? A compulsion? With you? Who dares? Many of your men are found dead in the streets. Mr. Kowalsky is Polish... he can't understand you. How do you communicate? Sign language. The moment I have your man, I'll call. Liberty at any price. Even if thousands are sacrificed. Such is the way of life. - Sure, I agree. - Clever man! You must congratulate the Pasha. If he were not my nephew's father, I would have shot him. Your Excellency will come with your car. Delivery in twenty minutes. Bon appetit. New Zealand meat. We'll sing "Lady be good." Samir still sings false. From 5 to 7 we'll pick a girl. Then we go to the party. I'll join you after tennis. Ok? At 5 in front of Yehia's house. Are we fishing for a girl... or racing? There's one... easy does it. Please come in. Welcome, I'm David. These are just friends. Tell me you love me to make my blood run! Are you an idiot? Get it over with. You smell of onions. Like animals. I'll never be able to make it. Touch her thighs! That'll do it. I can't... your leg's there. Should I feel your thighs? That's enough. You're too many. Three aren't doing anything. Hey, are you OK? I'm not. And you? I'm the asshole driver! Let go! Then seconds later she was drooling all over me. Miss Sarah wants a tie for Ibrahim. Why didn't you try doing it with her? You're going to Mohsen's party tonight? If you don't he'll kill you. Ibrahim my son, a strike would not harm the pasha alone. It could postpone badly needed armament at a time the Nazis are at our door. The workers' interests are over the Americans the British and the Russians. The workers make money working for the British! Maybe temporarily. No one will forgive you this. Neither the Pasha nor the Russians... What's your stand? New ideas have cropped up. I need to think. Think? What's your programme for today? I'll go home work on the university project, then sleep to dream of you. And when you get up? I'll think of you, and wait. I'll drop by tomorrow. What about tonight? Take these. They'll keep you warm. I'm warning you, I'll become so brilliant I'll forget all about love. I'd kill you! Any book of value is banned by the palace. How d'you expect them to know anything? Simple. You look worried. What's wrong? The Americans have discovered huge oil reserves in Saudi Arabia. What's upsetting about that? Nothing. However, logic says they'll need a military presence somewhere. To "protect" the oil. Palestine! And we wondered why the US and Britain seek our goodwill. Palestine, oh promised land. Instead of setting the highest ample in brotherhood and love, you will become the stage of terror. Man will kill his brother, just like in Genesis. O Jerusalem. Murderess of innocents and prophets. I told you I can't come to the party. Try it... I've sown it well. No use... forget it. I can't make it. I have work to do. What is it? Yehia is unhappy about his jacket. I'm lost. The kids need so many things. Your husband could change his attitude about money. I sent him Saneya Desouki, who wants to divorce, and instead of taking the case, he tells: "Go back to your man". He's right. Both are our friends. You're more stupid than he. You like to suffer. Saneya just went to another lawyer who took the money, lost the case, then said the judge was an ass. You could have used that money. It's hot, you know. Just throw it casually across your arm. They'll all be at their best. You know that. And l'll be like a pauper. We've had a new dress made for your sister. She's grown to be as lovely as Hedy Lamaar. And you're in the best school in Egypt. Best British education. The best of the best. By whose standards? Your friends'? And this best school, doesn't require decent clothes? Just simple, decent clothes. When you'll grow you'll have had an education with the elite. Your father has sacrificed his job to guarantee your school fees. Well? Gorgeous! You're lovelier than Hedy Lamaar. May I? Yehia, please go to Mohsen's party. They love you. Ma, honest, it's not that l can't go... I just don't want to. I'll take a dive then study my Shakespeare! Do you want to attract the military police up to here? He's again going back on his word. You had approved. I thought again. The Germans are more dangerous than the British. If we kill the guy, we'd be helping them. Our deed will end seventy five years of occupation. With one little blow! Moreover, I've set Morsi to pursue an intelligence officer on a secret mission. We'll know where Churchill's submarine will accost. The submarine appears, we zero in on Churchil. The British panic! The Germans charge! Bye bye British! Adel! Just a friend. Ibrahim... at our very first meeting, I craved to hear your voice. Then I wanted to see your eyes. One look... I was yours. Sarah, l have always felt that loneliness was my lot. That kept on being true, until I came to Alexandria... ...and met you. Sarah, I was blind, you opened my mind, you showed me the way. Give your back to the blackboard. You're a cad. The party was boring without you. I was ashamed to wear my torn jacket amongst all those filthy rich people. Girls like you for your dancing, not for your silly jacket. It was really boring. Sorry, what could I do? It's all in Arabic on the board. You'll remain asses all your lives. I just meant to recite the speech. Please sir, let me do it. I'll recite another scene: Hamlet's Mother. Look here upon this picture and on this. The counterfeit presentment of two brothers. See what a grace was seated on this brow. Hyperion's curls, the front of Jove himself. A combination and a form indeed. Where every god did seem to set his seal. This was your husband. Look you now what follows. Here is your husband, like a mildew'd ear. Have you eyes? Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed, and batten on this moor? Ha? Have you eyes? You cannot call it love: for at your age, the hey day in blood is tame, it's humble, and what judgement would step from this to this? It's humble, and waits upon the judgement. And what judgement... What devil was't that thus hath cozened you at hoodman-blind? O shame, where is thy blush? To flaming youth, let virtue be as wax and melt in her own fire. Nay, but to live in the rank sweat of an enseamed bed, stew'd in corruption; honeying and making love over the nasty sty. A murderer and a villain. A slave that is not twentieth part of the tithe of your precedent lord, a vice of kings, that from a shelf the precious diadem stole. Save me; and hover o'er me with your wings. You heavenly guards. What would you, gracious figure? Do you no come your tardy son to chide, that laps'd in time and passion, let's go by... the important acting of your dread command? O, say! O, say! Come back! You're not allowed to sail in front of the ships. They're audacious, knowing the Germans are at Matrouh, like women they're gifted with the sixth sense. See the timing of their demands? The British will surely stop them. They wouldn't let them enter Alexandria. How come you say the British Ambassador attends your show? - Mr. Hayden said he's coming... - When? The show is in two weeks. When did Hayden mention the ambassador? Yesterday. Only yesterday? Ok. Go now. If the ambassador is attending the show, it means: all's well! What is it? I need five pounds. That's the salary of five men. They're underpaid. Heard this? One would think he's a communist. Forget it. Drop by the cashier, he'll settle your problem. Why the detours? Here, take this. Tewfik, go tell the workers off. Ok for the overtime? I said no! Sir, l don't think we should try to be too clever. My God! You're a pest. He's over there... fishing. In that case I'll come back later. No. Just a few words with dad. Dad, I really impressed my class today. Good! Like father like son! I also usually did. Always top of the class. For the first time I love school. I dropped my independent job just to guarantee you the best of schools. You must go to University; I want you to be an engineer. I always wanted to be an engineer, but we were too poor. You'll fulfil that dream. But I am successful... acting. Why not? Act and have fun if you want, but study something serious. Acting is something serious. Your father's quite a guy. Always either hunting or fishing. While your father fishes for war sterlings. Spends his nights counting them and wants me to do the same. Imagine! His father and mine went to the same school like us. You think we'll be different like'them? Who was that? A summation. We either pay the rent or the furniture goes. How about my family reunion? You should have told us. The first Thursday every 3 months. Courts and summations and you speak of family reunions? My fault to have sold my belongings to help you. You expect these to make a soup? They're rats not rabbits! Catch... thief... my brief case! I swear to God, I'm telling the truth. The woman fell head over heels on me. I felt sorry for her and gave her some money. You should have finished him off. I didn't intend to hurt him. He argued... I punched him in the eye. Did you find whatever you needed? That's it! C-H-U... 1st part of Churchill's name. Then the word: "house". CHU-house. The spot where Churchill will land. Let me see. A submarine! See Ibrahim. Tactics! Top secret, that really must be it. Now for the finances. I just sold a private for 150 pounds. Imagine what Churchill would cost. You're talking to patriots performing their sacred task. And I should be a sucker? You take medals and I end up broke? We've taken nothing yet. You will! Take these... Only that? No way. Come and see me when... you appreciate the real value of things. Morsi... shame on you! You want to buy Churchill for ten pounds? You're really low life. Let's beat him then grab it. It's not necessary. I've learned it all by heart. Give them what they want. Our war situation is critical. We can't afford delays. It'll cost you much more, Pasha. I can't cover for you this time. Finished work? I've just started. I'm pleased to comply with your demands, and henceforth. Henceforth my ass! Nobody's forcing you to dance. Some rhythm. Why stick to us when you're such a lousy dancer. Come. Stay here and don't move. You're driving us crazy. One. Two. Three. Four. And I'm dancing. There! Sixteen different figures? Think you're Ziegfeld? The pasha's coming! We have spent every penny we have to hear him say he'll be an actor? You often see the same movie three times the same day. That means actors make money. I want him to be an engineer. Kadry, stop fooling me. I know what is eating you. They came here? The kids know? Selling my office was still not enough. They want the furniture... This appartment... The war is causing a crazy inflation! The boy's tuition alone needs a special budget. How will this end? What will I tell the kids? The furniture just walked away... Your mother must have told them. The girl's no problem. She'll get married. But the boy must continue his schooling. And he has the nerve to want to be an actor. A clown. I think, he ought to be an engineer. What's gone wrong in our lives? Why has it stopped clicking? Maybe, we're living beyond our means. It's no crime to strive for a better life. We're killing ourselves to keep our standard. You like fine things. Elegance for you and people around you. And here we are. Elegant with our furniture in the streets. Granny says there's no sugar, for her quince jam. And she can't do without cloves and sage. She's worried about aunt Olympia. Not only will aunt Olympia find no quince jam, but she won't even find a chair to sit and eat on. All the better! Your granny told you? You bet. What is it? What's wrong? Where's father? The Nazis made it from Tobrouk, to Marsa-Matrouh in four days. They could enter Alexandria! Pack everything. Tomorrow we sail for South Africa. I'm staying in Alexandria. I am expecting Ibrahim's baby. Ibrahim has to know this. The Nazis exterminate all the jews! Being egyptians won't spare us. We must flee the Germans. To South Africa... Right away. After the war, if things work out, maybe to Haifa. Ibrahim will never accept. Have you told him about your pregnancy? Cheers to "henceforth"! And to "the fulfilled demands"! You deserve a million! Never! We must strive for a just society! Strive for a just society? Sounds like your henceforth! Why don't you guys talk Arabic? I want the boy. You must not get rid of it. Call him Ibrahim. What if it's a girl? Call her Ibrahim. I'll see you before you leave? The moment I have news, I'll call. God! It's awful, but that's war. What is it, man? I'll be a father. That makes you sad? The boy is still not born, and the Germans will be here soon. A family that wants to take the tram to go downtown now needs at least ten pennies. Outrageous. Sign the petition, Mister. Or you sign it, Aida. Patience, Mussolini will soon be here... to exterminate injustice. Sign first. I wrote the English. My son must be comfortable at the prisoner's camp. Or else! Curse the English! What are you staring at? Hell's fire? Damn you all. If the Germans arrive don't tell them you've worked for the British! Both can go to hell! Every idiot has made money, except your father. One deal with the British, and we would have been well off. What will Olympia and her horrible husband say when they see we have no furniture? Don't worry. The landlord has left leaving dad the care of the rent. God! Now, he'll squander that too. OK Granny. Stay scared! Cheers, Nadia! Meanwhile, no sale. The furniture stays and the piano! Leave the old man alone! Mussolini will come riding his te horse to rid us of you. Kutchuk's gone, he's emigrated too. Mohamed can replace him. He's not up to it. He's overworked. And it seems the Germans are about to take the city. So no show and no ambassador. Who the hell cares? My Dad does! And how! Very, very, very much! The front rows. What'd make the ambassador sit in the third row? Ma! Where's the Mussolini hat? Everyone's here already. What do you mean? "Everyone's here"? We can see the British fleeing. Some come, others go... Yet decent people, never budge! Recite the poem. You abandon my family, to go to a silly show. You want to embarrass me in front of my family? Yehia insisted so much. So Yehia's more important than me? I should never have sold my building to lend you money. Ingrates. David! What's wrong? I'm not a child anymore. You could have told me we're leaving. We fixed everything for you. And kissed my friends goodbye? Sarah... Alexandria means all to me. Generations of our family have lived here. Also... my youth, all my thoughts, took root here. Your dear mother is buried here. To abandon all this means to rob me of my past. I'll wander away forever. You're crazy to do this alone uncovered. Every time I ask, you say later. Go ask them there to postpone their retreat. The bullet's almost out. Feel at home. Sarah must have already left. God's curse on he who brought us together. I was sure the car would be intact. A little push will do it. We're really all set. Water. Food. The Germans have reached Matrouh. I'd say they've reached Alexandria! How could Churchill come then? To pep-up his troops morale. The paper says he'll speak at the House of Commons tonight. Bet you, it's a look-alike. Old war tricks. One speaks there the other visits here. I hope our plan works. You're a man of God. Have faith. Mr. Hayden says strike out the "Hitler" sketch. Too late. It's already on. Who are you? - I'm Hitler. - Then who am I? Calm down. The news must be OK. Our guys have stopped the Germans. The British are really panicking. Pending disaster. This is hell. We must reach the Germans, and tell them of our secret. Churchill disappearing will end the war in a jiffy! I'll make everyone pay toll here. - You must pay toll. - How come? The English paid, the Italians did. The Germans too. But we're Egyptians. OK then, half tickets. Like kids. Sir! Slight problem with the cannon. No, no... heat the tea-pot first. The Italians have surrendered, what do we do with all these? Pray they do not occupy that spot before we end our mission. Are we to understand that you are counter-attacking? That is already done. Yehia was marvellous on stage. He had us die laughing. - He should go to Hollywood. - You're born for Hollywood! Bet Yehia has arrived? Like cats: he has seven lives. I have an idea. A bad one, I bet! Who'll vote for me? Who? Who? Hurray! Hurray! Here you have a genius with rich ideas. American ideas. All kinds of ideas. Hurray! Hurray! Actors' Association Elections Let's go. Why let everyone know we're pawning everything we have? Everybody is doing the same. It's the war. Who cares, anyway? Had your husband accepted to take Sania's case... Still not divorced? Why would her lawyer get one for her? He's not like your husband. Call that honesty? Yes I do. Had Kadry accepted every foul case we would own whole buildings. Welcome to my best client. We'll have a super-show. Like in American musicals. With an opera troupe and ballet. Why not a live circus? And policemen to check the traffic. I can handle anything. Dad won't like that. I don't want to fail either. Failure? Never. We'll go see Princess Chahinour. She'll patron our show. Your private course starts now. Every session costs two pounds. Hear him... I speak of royalty and he worries about 2 quid. Gladly! Of course. Just show the program to my secretary. I... can't find... words to thank your serene... I mean your excellency... I mean... Brilliant idea. If that man joins us, our manpower problem will be through. Thousands are behind him. The British are our problem, Your Eminence. We can handle them if you give us the men. Why wouldn't YOU join US? We'd become invincible. Our aims are similar. However... Listen to me son: we are no bigots. Through religion, we aim at precise political goals. The final goal being Egypt's happiness and prosperity. That same Egypt of which the Prophet said: Egyptians are the noblest of all soldiers. They are truthfully loyal. I pray Allah to safeguard you for Egypt, and I pray Him to safeguard Egypt for you, and to help us overcome hate rank, jealousy and Atheism for He is the Almighty. - He's a great guy. The best. - What a brain. But did you get whether he'll help us or not? What's that? Have we not asked him? It does not matter. His words have sparked another marvellous idea. We STILL haven't heard your previous magnificent one. What is that there? Farouk's palace. I grab this and blow out Farouk's brains. 450 pounds for one evening? That is more than a week's return. That's business. But they are just kids and their parents are friends. Their show is for the Red Crescent. Look, this is war. It won't last forever. Granny, where's the piano? There's a fiance for your sister, we need money for her trousseau. I needed it for my rehearsals. Rehearse at Mohsen's. The trousseau is more important. And this "couscous" is also more important? That's an annual-tradition! Slowly, it must simmer. I was at the pawn shop; I pawned my new ring. And I was at the Princess' palace; she agreed to sponsor the show. The Princess is about to leave. The hooligans are throwing rice at the orchestra and audience. I warned you it wouldn't work. We couldn't rehearse even once. We had the theater 15 min before the show. We should have cancelled it. Stop whining. Will you? Stop the opera and start the sailor number. Did you stop the opera? Hey you, pull up the curtains! No, not that one! The Princess left. And the pasha needs me early tomorrow. OK, we'll jump to the finale. I suggest that you apologise to the public. Just two more numbers to go. It's two in the morning. I'm responsible for these girls. We'll take taxis. OK, go to hell. Get ready for our dance. Mohsen, we'll go to the final number. Forget the rest. But you dance in it! I killed myself for this number. I'll do it. No one's left to see it. You've burnt Christ! You've burnt Christ! It's not me. It's him. Then he'll surely die. He'll die for burning Christ! Get the sheets and wrap the boy. It's his last chance. Soak the sheets in hot water. Wrap him in completely from head to toe. The elder died! The elder died! He died for burning Jesus. Lock him in his room. The younger should've died instead. Why hide in this sinister place? If I have to face the whole world, I'll still be an actor. We all support you. Granny once said: The younger should've died! 'This your brother? A genius. You really made that film? With my camera. The projector is mine. It's terrific! Who are these? Essam and Nicolas, passionate actors. That's you? You could say so. My son Mohsen is a musical genius. But I'm sending him to Lancaster, to study Political Economy. Excellent, Yehia. Really professional. Why not Mahmoud Tracy? Pasadena?! They couldn't pay the theatre... fiasco. They ruined the guy. The best school of Dramatic Arts is certainly London's Royal Academy. What's all this about studying abroad? His father is penniless! If only dad would let me go to the U.S.A., I'd study music and you cinema! America? Penniless... Penniless... Oh what a pain... Samir is leaving at dad's expense. His father works for your dad. Both U.S.A. and Britain want you, Yehia. Could Yehia be helped to go to the U.S.A.? You've once invited the British Ambassador to a show. It was a great show. Organise another and I'll invite the U.S. Ambassador. Roosevelt is the winning card. Hamlet would be ideal. Show uncle Adel your genius! Lights! Camera! Angels and Ministers of Grace defend us. Thou comest in such a questionable shape. That will speak to thee. I call thee Hamlet... Majesty! Father... King... Royal Dane. Oh answer me. We suggest Hamlet, Sir. Our committee decided. Unanimously. That was a collective vote. A democratic decision! Cromwell! Remember? Like your first parliament? That's what you taught us. Reject a good deal? Chaker Pasha has fired us all. Now that the British have won... ...He can hit back. Sly son of a bitch. Let us use the worker's wrath, and start our organisation. None of my business. I take my wages and leave. That's not manly. Leaving the fight. Real cowards. He fires you and you accept. I'd shoot him down! All collaborators should be shot down. Rest assured, it is almost cannon proof. Mr. Elie is on the phone. You didn't give them the theatre for one single rehearsal. They are kids, and after all it's a charity show. I know you're no charity. If you need anything from the port, just ask me. He'll cut the sum in 10 instalments. Where would we get them? Your pocket money. If you fail, you pay. He should help us. And lose fifty pounds. There's a war on, you know. People are killing each other for money. Had the Germans won, and had someone denounced us, we'd all be in the streets now. Worse off than Yehia and his failure of a father. And what if they had confiscated your car? Why? I'm Egyptian, not English. They don't give a damn. Neither do I. I'm ready to be anything. Red, blue or green to save my wealth and skin! You, maybe. Not I. Spare us your uncle Adel's patriotic act. Does the pasha return afternoons? What to write, my love? It's hell. Life away from you is unbearable. Far from Egypt. Egypt is not just a word. It is kindness and generosity. I see it through your dark eyes. I see it smiling, against all odds. My return to Alexandria, has become an obsessive dream. Yet a dream, fading away every day. So many are trying to convince father that our place is Palestine, the promised land. The Zionists have overwhelmed father's thoughts and conquered David's heart. All this stuff is yours? Ibrahim, right? Who are your accomplices? I have none. You're a communist, you'll be condemned. If the sentence is tough, it'll be hard on his parents. They spared nothing for his education. But that's how lucky he could get! My son has just tasted injustice. People I trust, told me about you and about your patriotism. They say you smashed a guy's head because he suggested you were not Egyptian. Your friend has parents? Let me put things straight from the start. 1) My name must never be mentioned or else I'll be fired from the army. 2) There'll be absolutely no remuneration for you. Both his parents and I are penniless! What's the verdict? Fine. Kindly stay seated. The Brits have forbidden hunting on lake Mariotis. I might go shoot at Edkou. Ducks are good there. The bullet is for 3 pennies. Where will Mohsen study? In England. The war seems to be ending. He'll go with Samir. His cousin. Samir and his father prepared everything for the trip. Good. They'll have each other company. Travelling alone is no fun. Albert says he finally found a job for you at the bank. If I had Chaker Pasha's money, I would've sent you to Paris "Mother of all arts". You know? When I got my B.A. there, I got acquainted with the loveliest ballerina. You just fill this application, you'll be accepted at the bank. Albert has a connection in the bank. You start your training there tomorrow. Then after a small test, they'll take you as a full-time employee. Just the application. - Can you give me a lift? - Sure. Tomorrow at 9 a.m. at the bank. Don't forget, kid! You see me as a bank employee, while he pictures me a tinker. Do you still want to be an actor? Imagine? Despite... Despite my failure? Because of my failure, maybe. You have guts, don't you? Enough guts to know that I still need to learn. I don't want to whine or blame it on the war like you all do. Everyone mocked us, even our friends. Friends? They mock you and you still call them friends? Anyway, if they mocked anyone, it was me, not you. We've lost your brother. Must we lose you too? The genius is gone, why not the flop? That's the truth. You think that dad and I are flops. Better shut up! You'd have us thieves, like all those who thrive on wars! That's success! God! The honest man is lonely, indeed! I'm warning you: It's Pasadena or suicide! No reaction? Good idea. Which? Pasadena or suicide? That you let me finish my make-up. You could have given me a role. Your French is poor. Learn it first. My French is poor, my English so so, my direction lame! It's a fact. You are all so so. No knowledge, no success! Also with no money... no knowledge! It's your turn, Lisette! I'm coming! Get accepted first at Pasadena, then we'll see. God has given you talent, take care of it. It's not yours. It belongs to the millions. I don't need a lawyer. I thank the court for assigning you, in the name of fake justice. Kindly get out, sir. I need no one. I can defend myself. You're done? That's your lot, man! Whether you like it or not, I'll be your defense. I said I didn't need you. Sergeant! You fear I may win the case? Rest your heart. I'll lose it. 99 % I'll lose it. You'll get maximum sentence. And for the nth time, they'll call me, an ass of a lawyer. That's our lot, man! An ass pleading for an ass. Why are you insisting then? A breather. A breather for both of us. I might make a nice pleading, a journalist might say a kind word, a judge might feel a pang of justice. It'll be a breather for all! Hard times! Times when dropping bombs on innocents is justified, and you want me to win it? When humans are grilled alive because of their colour, and you want me to win it? When they recruit kids, aged 16 or 17, and bury them in the sand in the name of the 4 freedoms, and you want me to win it? When a guy makes 5.000 pounds a minute while the tram ticket's a problem for the poor and I win it? All I can hope for, is a slightly less cruel sentence. This court condemns Ibrahim Charkawi to 15 years hard labour. Unwind man. Relax. 15 years? That's cruel. Ibrahim is to blame too. He's too impulsive. Who stole my pencil sharpener? Are you calling your superior a thief? Much as father is sad that the war is over, and happy as I am to travel, still I wish you'd be with me. The shadow of death is away from me. See? He can't be dead. Look. His picture. What is his name? He's a soldier, and still missing since the battle of Alamein. He might be dead. Many have died. He wrote me after the battle, to say he was still alive. What's happening? We've rented out our house for the summer. Your dad and Nadia will be able to go to Beirut, before another girl steals the fiance. What's this mess? We're leaving right away. Then we'll move to the Mex, after they leave for Beirut. We rented a little cottage on the beach. We'll be squeezed for a while, until Nadia and your father leave. Yehia, Mohsen wants you to call him. Urgently. Mohsen, I was about to call you. Leaving immediately? Go ahead, I'll join the others. No, please come with me. I told you to stay near Mohsen. And carry his suitcase, maybe? I'll be on the first ship back. After she cures her rheumatism. Meanwhile suspend all payments. That's a good brake. You're better than l am. Are you kidding? No, I'm not. That's the second time round. Come on, let's have a third. The ship's captain will murder us. To hell, let him! Once more? No, that's enough. Write again to Pasadena. Like you said, I want you quickly in Hollywood. Bye-bye you bastard. Study hard, will you? A few steps to your right there. You can't miss the cottage. There's a great view of the harbour. And Albert is cooking crabs inside. What's this you're saying? Swear! I swear. Here? Downstairs? Right now? Control yourself, man! Her name is... Sarah! You deserve these. He looks like foreigner. He's our son, Ibrahim. I thought I escaped the Nazi inferno, yet in Haifa I faced another. Nazism is dead, but in Palestine battles rage and may last a hundred years. Dad had promised to show me a perfect society. I saw Judaism become a nationality in blood and violence. Every Jew anywhere in the world, has now a nationality, different from the one of his country of birth. I condemn terrorism explicitly. I refuse to affirm a right at the expense of another. Amidst all this, I dreamt of nothing but our small room on the roof. Of your eyes. Of you. Ibrahim I want you. Do you understand? O God. His eyes are so blue. He's all you. The next one will be just like you. Are we completely forgotten? What news of Mohsen? He sent me your address. He's asking about your trip. Yes miss. We'll check your account. Look, if I'm able to save six dollars from my monthly pay. I'll need 533 months, that is 44 years. Add my age, which is 18 years, and we conclude that... I'll be able to pay for my studies in America when I'm 62 years old. To this you may add a minimum of three years studying... How much does that make? 65 years exactly. Ideal age to start a career! You're crazy. Delirious? Oh mother for the love of grace lay not that flattering unction to your soul. That not they tresspass but my madness speaks. Hamlet will drive you loony! What about all this? You're right. I have nothing to offer to anyone. What about me? Bear with me! What do I have but complaints. And more complaints about this ship of misery, this tomb that is Alexandria. Oh Alexandria! Why was I ever born here? There's very little time, the ship is in the harbour. You must complete your visa formalities. Say that again. You must go to the consulate to take your Visa. The Pasadena Playhouse has accepted me! Here! Burn these. I'll catch the damn boat. No time to hesitate. You'll never make it. We can at least try! But your father's in Lebanon. My whole future will depend on what you'll write in this cable. 15 hours on a train from Beirut via Palestine, just to hear you ranting? What made you come? You know he's determined. We knew he'd drive you crazy. Say the truth, Kadry. You came back to find a solution. To help him. Who knows? He might succeed and become more than just a clerk behind a desk in a crummy bank, earning next to nothing? How much money do we still have? Forty five pounds. I'll pawn this for another twenty. You just got it back from the pawn-shop. Take these too. I think, I could probably get you three pounds tomorrow. How much do we need in all? Eighty pounds for the Foreign Studies Office, otherwise no Visa. Then add the ship's fare. How much is that? 120 pounds. I have 90 pounds on my account. 45 pounds plus 40 = 85 pounds. 80 pounds deposit and five for the Cairo trip. As for the ticket, we'll work that out in due time. But tomorrow's Friday, everything's closed. We'll borrow from Chaker Pacha! No, not him! A 24 hour loan won't ruin him. We'll show him the account book. Another yet losing case? You really enjoy that, don't you? The Pacha has agreed to the loan, only the cashier has no cash. No 80 pounds for just 24 hours? Don't worry about the ship's fare. Pack my suit-case, Ma. Don't forget my blue shirt! The swimming trunks are worn out, but they'll do. We'll be back on time to catch the ship. Don't tarry. Nadia, you go to the Consulate, and tell them to remain open and keep the stamps out, until we come back. They promised to wait. Will we find the money for the ticket? By hook or by crook. He defends tramps and wants a loan for that half-breed of his. Account-book, my foot! His son in America? He thinks America is a doorstep away. Just like going to the beach. Why don't they live according to their means? They strive for something better, maybe. When one's broke, one's better off staying put. The father's a failure, the boy will follow his footsteps. The boy knows exactly what he wants. He'll make it. You bet. Your brother's gone haywire. What news? You count! We still need another 35 pounds. I am sure I can get you three pounds. - How much do you need? - Another 32 pounds. Here are 17. My salary. - No way! - I borrowed them from Kadry. Anything else? No. There's no one to ask for more. I know someone. Mr. Diab! Just a second. Dad! Here it is! Please... just another half hour. You're joking. - You have two new shirts. - Two shirts for two years? Tomorrow before sailing, we'll buy two more. Tomorrow the shops are closed. Just rags, all this. I know! Suddenly he's leaving, and a second later the ticket... and the savings... and then bye-bye and then... ...two years. Two long years away from me! Here, son. Try this on. Hope it's your size. My brother's beautiful! Ibrahim knows well you've done your best. I've lost the case. Had you offered that sum 2 days ago... Today everything's worked out fine. We've been able to send the boy to America. Please let me be at peace with myself. I'm honoured, Mr. Kadry. I admire people who can say "No". I admire you. My son's leaving tomorrow. Yehia? David's back with you! David is studying in military school in America. Then maybe we'll meet. Maybe. The taxi is still not here. Yet I told him to be precisely on time. We'll miss the ship. My car is at your disposal. Why thank you, sir... Pasha... Bey. Not at all, sir. Thanks truly. At your service. Here's my card. Write... we'll do business together. Give my regards to Roosevelt. And you worry that I may win it? Mama! Everything went at such a speed, that I haven't had time to see you. Be brave but do not stay there too long. Your father is getting old and he would want... We all want to see you return an important man. Successful. Come back to us, Yehia. Come back to Alexandria. I'll wave like that, so you'll recognize me. He's so small for that big ship. What else are you telling him? A haircut before reaching New York. Subtitled by: ANIS EBEID Cairo - Egypt
