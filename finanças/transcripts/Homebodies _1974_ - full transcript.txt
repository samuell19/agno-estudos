Just wait right there. Move it along. We're a little late. There you go. There you go. [mover mumbles] All right, now everyone wait right here. [lamp shatters] [hammering] No, no. We haven't got time for that now. Come on. It's time to get on the bus. Here we go. [mover whimpering] Come on. We haven't time, dear. [mover whimpering] [hammering] Time to go. Come on. - I can't go. - Come on, we have a lovely room waiting for you in a nice, clean building. - I can't go! - We told you all about it. - I can't go! - Mr. Higgins. It's time to go. There. That's right. You'll like it. I promise you. Okay. [hammering] [knocking on door] - It's me, Mattie. [machinery rumbling outside] Can't hear yourself think in here! [machinery rumbling outside] [window slams shut] - I saw them moving the people out down the street. They'll come for us tomorrow. You think just because I don't go out that I don't know what's going on. You're mistaken. I do. They'll come for us tomorrow, won't they? - I don't want you to worry. [melancholy music] - My father owned 14 buildings. This is only one of 14 buildings my father owned in this neighborhood. He wouldn't let something like this happen. That was a long time ago, of course. Things were very different then. People respected us. We were very elegant here. Well, not so very elegant, but it was nice. Everyone with his own house, with curtains at the windows and flowers in the back. I remember how it was. There's always dirt now. [machinery rumbling outside] [window slides open] [rumbling gets louder] That's a fine new building. This neighborhood's looking up. There'll be elegant people here again. - You like that noise? - No! Mattie, what are we gonna do? [machinery rumbling] [pensive music] - Hey, you got some for me, granny? [construction workers chattering] [machinery whirring] [whirring continues] [whirring continues] [cable snaps] [construction worker screaming] [beam slams] [screaming stops] [construction workers murmuring] - [Construction Worker] Somebody call an ambulance. - Somebody call a doctor? - What for? [ambulance siren approaching] [ambulance siren blaring] [siren continues] [construction workers murmuring] - Better bring the sack. - I'm calling my men off! - You tell him! - We got nothing but trouble on this job! - And another thing! We're gonna have a whole day off for the funeral! [tires squeal] - Why isn't anyone working? - I called 'em off! - Cable snapped. Tomorrow when your men come back, rig it double strength. I never heard of one of them cables breaking like that, Mr. Crawford. - I never have either. You keep your mouth shut. I want those men back. I don't want any more delays on this job. [no audio] [cart creaking] [knocking on door] - It's me, Mattie. There's been an accident. A man was killed. I'd just given him some prunes. It was his own fault. He was riding up on one of those steel beams. You're not supposed to do that. I've watched them, and they never do that. They've stopped working. - I know. Isn't it wonderful? Listen how quiet it is. [soft violin music] [playing violin] [violin continues] - I think I'm gonna paint the trim out front, Mother. - What for? - Paint's beginning to flake. I just noticed it today. - But why paint a building that's coming down next week? - Don't you know they stopped work over there? Don't that mean anything to you? Maybe they won't come here at all. [violin continues] - A man was killed today, Papa, over where they're building the new skyscraper. He fell. I could hear him screaming from here. I never heard anything like it. It must be terrible knowing you're gonna die in just another few seconds. I don't suppose there was much left of him. I'm sorry. I know that's no sort of conversation for the table, but I thought you'd be interested. You see, Papa, after the accident, the other men refused to work anymore. They all went home. And, oh, Papa, maybe we won't have to move out of our home. [knocking on door] - It's me, Mattie. [violin continues] [violin continues] Mind if I sit down? Good to see you happy again. [soft music] [cane tapping] [soft music continues] [cane tapping] [dramatic music] [workers chattering] [cane tapping] - When Frank and me moved in here, he said it would only be a temporary dislocation. Those were his words, "temporary dislocation". A month or two and out we go, flying off to our green castle in the sky. Temporary dislocation? That was 40 years ago. All the times we planned on moving out of here, always looking forward to getting out. Now, all I want to do is stay. [soft music] [vehicles rumbling] [car door closes] [no audio] [no audio] - Are you Mrs. Loomis? - Yes. - That your husband outside? - Yes. - Doesn't he know you're moving out of here? - Yes, he knows. - What does he think he's doing? - It's hard for him, miss. He's been super here for so long, it's like it was his own place. He must have painted every inch at least 10 times over in the past 30 years and fixed all the pipes and changed the wires. He won't have nothing to do if he has to go. We've lived here here so long. - You can't live here any longer. The building's coming down. This is your relocation notice. [footsteps tapping] [knocking on door] [knocking on door] - Oh, hello. I'm glad to see you. Please come in. I'm afraid things seem a little disorganized. I'll fix a place for you. - Don't bother. I said don't bother! - But I have to talk to you. You see, I can't move away from here. - I'm afraid you don't have a choice. - What? - I said, you don't have a choice! You can't stay here. - But it's because of my wife, don't you see? When she died 15 years ago, I wanted to die too. I loved her. But then somehow I got started on a project of mine, a book that we'd always kid at each other I'd write. And now, you see, this is it. For 15 years I've been collecting all these things and arranging them. I know where everything is. These are the makings of my book. And now, now I'm starting to put them together here. - I'm sorry. I really don't have time to listen. - No, miss, please listen. You see, it's a book of our memoirs. We were married for 55 years. Well, I can't quit working on it now. If I did that, I... I'd feel I was living for nothing, now that the boss is gone. [chuckles] The boss. That's what I called my wife. - You can keep on working in the new place. All this stuff can be packed up and moved. - Oh, the packing's easy enough. It's the unpacking that worries me. It would take me another 15 years to do it, and I don't have the time. Don't you see? It's not the same thing for me as it is for you. I really don't have the time. - It's not my decision. Here's your notice. You're to move out today. - Today? - That's what I said! You've known the date for weeks! [footsteps tapping] [door creaks] Mr. Blakely? Mr. Blakely? Are you aslee- [bed creaks] You have to read this. I mean, you have to get someone to read it to you. - What is it? - [Miss Pollack] It's a relocation notice. - Where do you expect me to relocate? - We found a place for you. - Yes, I imagine you have. At double the rent in a strange neighborhood halfway across the city. I've lived here for 38 years. I know this building. The streets of this neighborhood, they know me. I'm too old to learn over again. - I don't want my tenants disturbed! I'm superintendent here. - They are not your tenants! No one's paid any rent for months. - We pay the rent! They sent it back! - That's right. They don't want your money. They want you out of here. - But we've lived here so long. [footsteps tapping] [knocking on door] It's no use. She won't answer you. - Is she in there? - She's always in there. [knocking on door] You're wasting your time. She won't open the door. She hasn't left that room in 20 years. - I am not wasting my time. That woman has to move out of here. I have to talk to her. I have to give her this. - I'll give it to her. - I have to give it to her myself. [knocking on door] [knocking on door] Miss Wilkins? [knocking on door] Miss Wilkins? [Miss Pollack gasps] - That's enough. - Let go of me! - Leave her alone then. - Not until she comes out. - She's not coming out. She's not going. Neither am I. - Of course you're going. - No. We won't go. - Won't go? What about the other people on this street? They went. We've moved out thousands of old people like you. What makes you think you're any different? Why should you be given special treatment? - I don't care what anybody else did. We're not going! - I'll get a court order. I'll have you thrown out. - No, we won't let you do that. You better not try. - Are you threatening me? Who do you think you are? I'm not afraid of you. - Maybe we'd better just along- - No! We're not going! - She's right. Get outta here! [Miss Pollack gasps] Leave us alone. - I'll help you down. [no audio] [door closes] - Hey, what's going on in there? [slams envelope] [door handle rattling] - Listen to me! In another few days, when they're finished putting the steel up over there, they're going to come here, and they're gonna smash these old tenements down! Now, if you're still here when they come, they'll bring the police and drag you out, and there is nothing you can do to stop them! You are acting like children! If you leave now, there won't be trouble. You're only hurting yourselves, you know. Will you listen to me? I am trying to help you! Now, I want you to come out of there right now! Will you listen to me? [car door slams] [engine starts] [tires screeching] [truck rumbling] [soft music] [soft music continues] [soft music continues] [soft music continues] [typing on typewriter] [no audio] [door opens] - Are everybody's lights out? - Yes! They turned off the gas too. - There's no water. - I have some candles! You're all welcome! - I'll get some water down the street. I've got buckets in the cellar. - There's some stacks of wood where the buildings are down. I'll get some and we can build a fire for the cooking. - I'll help you. - I'll come with you. - Wasn't everybody nice? It was like a big family with everybody helping each other. Mrs. Loomis making a big pot of soup for all of us. It was just like a time when... This is really quite good. Isn't the candlelight pretty? I love eating by candlelight. It reminds me of when... When I was younger. - I keep thinking about that man who was killed. - What? - I keep thinking about the man who was killed, the one who fell. Those people don't care about us. That girl doesn't feel sorry for us. There's no reason for us to worry about what happens to them. [cart creaking] [cart creaking] [chatter on radio] [violin playing] [violin continues] [violin continues] - I just don't like the job. I mean, the cables are all worn out on the thing. I mean, it's no good. The whole job's a bum job as far as I'm concerned. You know what I mean? [coffee splashes] I don't care for a job like that. If I could walk off tomorrow, I would. [gate rattling] [elevator whirring] [bouncy music] [bouncy music continues] [elevator explodes] [construction workers shouting] [sparks crackling] [construction workers shouting] - Cut the power! Cut the power! - Hey, I've had it with this job! I've had it! - Cut the power! [lever clunks] [elevator whizzing] - [Construction Worker] Look out! [elevator slams] [debris clattering] - All three of them. Fried like bacon. - Get me Crawford! - You tell him my men our out. - No, I want Crawford! Get me Crawford! - They're out and they're gonna stay out. You tell him that. - Would you get the hell off the line and let me talk to the boss! - They're going home. I want him to know that. I wanna go. My men are out! - Mr. Crawford? There's been another accident! - Tell him. Tell him. - Three men are dead. - Tell him my men are out. - [Superintendent] And your building's on fire. [construction workers murmuring] [tires squealing] [construction workers murmuring] - I'm pulling my men, Mr. Crawford! I'm pulling 'em right now! We ain't gonna work here no more! - [Worker] Our contract doesn't cover getting cooked! - Give me the names of the next of kin. - Yes, sir. - Charity isn't gonna make it right! - My men are out! This job is closed till further notice. I wanna find out what's going on here. Who is she? What the hell are you doing here? Get outta here! You outta your minds letting an old woman like that in here? Get her out! - Yes, sir. [intriguing music] [knocking on door] - It's me, Mattie. There's been another accident. Three men were killed. They've stopped working again. We'll be all right for a while. - Mr. Crawford, that elevator was inspected last week. Everything was okay. Nothing like this should have happened. Mr. Crawford, do you think that maybe it could be a case of sabotage? - Sabotage? What Sabotage? Everybody's happy on this job! I got no enemies here! - No, of course not. I understand. - I got no labor problems! - No. - Everybody's been paid off! [engine shuts off] What the hell do you think you're doing up there? Don't you know these buildings are coming down? Hey! Can you hear me? You've got no business up there on that scaffold! What are you painting this building for? You live here, old man? Don't you know everybody's supposed to be out of this block? All right, I'll have you moved out in the morning! - Who are you? - My name's Crawford! I own this building! I own all of this! Who are you? - My name's Loomis. I'm superintendent here. - Oh, is that so? Well, you're a good worker, Loomis. I can see that. If you weren't such an old man, I'd give you a job. - I got a job. No you haven't! This building's coming down! You're wasting your time here! [no audio] How many of you are there in this place? Look, I got enough troubles without people like you squatting on my property! This is a $50 million project! Tomorrow morning, you're out! All of you, out! [engine starts] Tomorrow morning, out! [car zooms off] [no audio] [soft music] - We'll just pack the things you need. I'll pack you. You bring me the things you want. [soft music continues] [soft music continues] [soft music continues] What's the matter? - I need all my things. I want them all. [cars approaching] [door opens] [no audio] - What's the trouble? I don't see any trouble here. - There are two more. [quick footsteps] [quick footsteps] Mrs. Spencer? Mrs. Spencer? - Somebody supposed to be here? - Uh-huh. [quick footsteps] [knocking on door] [door opens] Miss Wilkins? Miss Wilkins? - Somebody's supposed to be in here too? [furniture shuffling] [no audio] [no audio] - Did any of you see Mrs. Spencer or Miss Wilkins leave? - I did. I heard them. They left last night. I recognize their footsteps. - You see? They're gone. Chances are you'll never see either one of them again. - All right, let's move it. Let's get going. [engine revving] [vehicle departing] [slow music] [slow music continues] [slow music continues] [slow music continues] [slow music continues] [slow music continues] [chair and table clatter] [door closes] [door opens] - Who is it? - You're lying.

Is she the girl they sent from the city? - Yes. - She was coming for me. - Yes. - What if somebody finds her? - Gotta hide her. - Where? - I don't know. It's her car. If they find it, they'll come looking for her here. - What are we gonna do? - I suppose they'll have to drive it away. - Can you? - I don't know. Haven't driven a car in 40 years. - What about her? [no audio] [no audio] [no audio] [no audio] [door handle rattles] [door opens] [bumps head] [door creaks] [glove compartment opens] [horn honks] [keys jangling] [stomps foot] [levers clicking] [windshield wipers squeaking] [engine starts] [engine revs] [breaks screech] [engine hums] [bouncy music] [bouncy music continues] [tires squeal] [car thuds] [engine revs] [tires squeal] [engine revs] [tires squeal] [horn honking] [engine revs] [bouncy music] [windshield wipers tapping] [lever clicks] [truck rumbling] [brakes squeal] [engine revs] [horn honking] [engine revving] [brakes screech] [child blows raspberry] [bouncy music] [car slams] [gears shift] [engine revs] [chatter on police radio] [bouncy music] [engine puttering] [car dies] [no audio] [garbage truck whirring] [knife clatters] [tense music] [tense music continues] [tense music continues] I think you better come up. [no audio] [no audio] It's all right. Please come in. [Mrs. Loomis gasps] - Holy mother of God. [cane tapping] - What is it? Is there somebody dead? - Yes. - Who is it? - It's the girl from the city. - What happened to her? - I think she's been stabbed. - Oh my God. - Who stabbed her? - She came back. She shouldn't have come back. [no audio] - You mustn't blame Miss Emily. She was frightened. The girl was coming to take her away. We mustn't let anyone take Miss Emily away. - What are we going to do? What do we tell the police? - We won't tell the police anything, Mother. The police will never find out. We can't have the police here. [spectators chattering] [lawn bowling balls clacking] - Time for your exercise. [spectators chattering] [lawn bowling balls clacking] [traffic rumbling] - Hey, wait a minute! [suspenseful music] Come on! [suspenseful music] [suspenseful music continues] [suspenseful music continues] - She's completely paralyzed, ain't she? Poor thing. Is she family? Her parents are dead, I guess. Oh, it must be an awful burden to the two of you. I know just how you feel. Do you live close by? I get on just fine with sick people. Maybe... Maybe I could come help. I could read to her or just sit with her. I've got nothing to do, and I got plenty of time. I just like to help people do. - Do you really! [pedestrian shrieks] [traffic rumbling] [soft music] [tools rattling] [engine starts] [tense music] [tense music continues] [train whistle blows] [train rumbling] [train whistle blows] [soft music] It's all right. We did it. - I saw the police outside. I thought they were going to come in here. I think they were looking for... - [Mr. Loomis] Don't worry, Mother. No one will ever know what happened. - It's not right. That poor girl was only trying to do her job. You be still. It had to be done. - It's not right! - I don't wanna talk about it, Mother. [no audio] - [Marion] Hello? - Hello, Marion? - [Marion] Is that you mother? - Yes! - [Marion] Oh. What do you want, Mother? - How are you? - [Marion] I'm all right. - That's nice. - [Marion] Ernest has been sick a lot. Nerves, I guess. He's got some kind of trouble at work. I don't what it is. He won't tell me- - Marion, there's something I've got to talk to you about. I want to ask you something. - [Marion] It's not about money, is it, Mother? Because if it is, I'm afraid there's nothing we can do right now. We've had a lot of expenses we didn't expect. - We don't need any money. - [Marion] Then what is it? There's the doorbell, mother. What is it? I gotta go. - Nothing. I'm sorry I bothered you, Marion. - [Marion] Don't talk like that, Mother. It was great hearing your voice. We gotta get together. We'll come and see you real soon, okay? - That'll be nice. - [Marion] You and Pop stay healthy. - We will. - [Marion] Bye. - Goodbye. [tense music] [tense music continues] [tense music continues] [tense music continues] - [Mrs. Loomis] We can't stay here. - [Mr. Loomis] Why not? - Don't you remember what that that girl said? She said when they finish over there, they'll come here. How can we stay you here? - Well, they haven't come yet, Mother. - To the steel and concrete of the Crawford Center! [guests chattering] [soft knocking] [knocking continues] [ball bouncing] [quick footsteps] - Father! [tense music] [tense music continues] [cart creaking] - Who are you? What do you want? - I wanna talk to you. - Go ahead, talk. - Not here! Come with me. - [Crawford] Come where? - It's not far. You come with me. You better come with me. It's important. [cart creaking] [creaking continues] In here. [mysterious music] Come on This way. It's all right. Come on. [mysterious music] It's important. Come on. Come on. Come on. [tense music] [pulley creaks] [Crawford shouting] [dramatic music] [Crawford grunting] - Don't just stand there! Let me down! What do you think you're doing? What do you want? - [Mattie] We want our building back. - This is my building! - It's our home. - I saw what you did. Spent your time painting a condemned building. [laughs] What an idiot trick. - [Mrs. Loomis] You mustn't talk that way to him. - What's the matter with you, old man? [laughs] You getting soft in the brain? [rope creaking] These old buildings are coming down! There's nothing you can do about it! [laughs] Let me down! Let me down! All right. Let me down and I'll find you a better place to live, okay? In a new building with built-ins, garbage disposals. How about that? - No. - We wanna live here. - Well, you can't do it! Look, let me down or I'll have the police on you! I'll have you all in jail! - Jail? I'm 79 years old. Do you really think they'd put me in jail? And even if they did, what difference would it make to me? - He's right. We really don't have much to lose. - All right. You can have your building. You can stay here. [panting] Let me down. I give you my word. - [Mattie] I don't believe him. - [Mr. Loomis] Neither do I. - God damn you, let me down! I don't give a damn how old you are, you won't get away with this! I won't give you a thing! I'm gonna get you all! What right have you to get in my way? [breathing heavily] You're nothing but a worthless bunch of senile old fools! [Crawford groaning] Let me down! [sobbing] [elevator doors open] [soft music] [Crawford grunting] [Crawford grunting] [soft music] [Crawford whimpering] [motor rumbling] [rumbling continues] [Crawford grunting] [body thuds] [wheelchair rattling] [Crawford grunting] [grunting continues] [motor revs] [concrete gurgling] [Crawford grunting] [concrete gurgling] [Crawford grunting] [concrete gurgling] [Crawford grunting] [concrete gurgling] [Crawford grunting] [concrete gurgling] [Crawford grunting] [concrete gurgling] [motor shuts off] [bubbles popping] [Mr. Loomis sighs] - I hope they put enough lime in it. [horn honking] [cane tapping] - What's this? [Mrs. Loomis gasps] [Mattie grunting] - It won't go back. - Well, there's only one thing to do. [quick footsteps] [ax chops] [Mrs. Loomis gasps] [spade tapping] [elevator doors open] - Mr. Crawford? Are you up here, Mr. Crawford? Is there anything we can do for you, Mr. Crawford. [water splashes] - To the bricks and mortar of 522 South 24th Street and to the flesh and blood of those who call it home, forgive us our sins. [machinery rumbling] [rumbling continues] [rumbling continues] - What good did it do, putting that poor man in the wall? It didn't change anything at all. They came just the same. I'll never be able to forget his eyes and the sound he made when he... - Be quiet, Mother. - I'll never be able to forget it. [machine rumbling] [wrecking ball slams] [debris clattering] [wrecking ball slams] [wrecking ball slams] [walls tumbling] [wrecking ball slams] [debris rattling] [wall tumbles] [no audio] [no audio] [door opens] [soft footsteps] [chatter on telephone] - Have you lost your way home again, dearie? She gets confused sometimes, officer. I'll see she gets home. Come on, dearie. Come on. Everything's going to be all right. What are you trying to do? Don't you know what'll happen to us if anyone finds out? - I don't care! - What about your husband? Don't you care what happens to him? - If last night had never happened, everything would be all right. They'd forgive him for helping you hide that girl's body. - What about the other times? It isn't just last night, you know. Those accidents over on the construction, they weren't accidents at all. We did them, your husband and Mr. Blakely and me. There are six people dead, and there'll be more if someone gets in the way. Do you understand me? [suspenseful music] [bolt creaking] [suspenseful music] [machine rumbling] [suspenseful music] [machine rumbling] [wrecking ball slams] [construction worker shouts] [ambulance siren blaring] [siren stops] [gurney rattling] [quick footsteps] - Mother! Mother! Where are you going? - I don't know! I've gotta get away from here. [sobs] You told me no one else would get hurt. - It was an accident. All we wanted was to stop them working. - It doesn't make sense. Don't you see? You can't stop them. Do you really believe that they won't smash this whole building down like I have all the rest? - But they're not working now, Mother. Listen. We can stay here a little while longer. - No. It's no good here anymore. Don't you see? It'll never be the same again after the things you've done. I don't want to stay here anymore! I've gotta get away from here. Let me go, please. I'm sorry. [sobbing] - Mother. Mother! [dramatic music] [dramatic music continues] Wait! I'm goin' with ya! [dramatic music] [urn slams] [dramatic music] Greta! [no audio] [no audio] [somber music] - [Miss Emily] Mr. Loomis? Mr. Loomis! Is Mrs. Loomis badly hurt? [soft music] - She's alive. - [Miss Emily] Mr. Loomis! - She should have a doctor. - No. - [Miss Emily] Mr. Loomis! - If a doctor came, they'd take her away. Why take her away now? - [Miss Emily] Mr. Loomis! Mr. Loomis! [knocking on door] - It's me, Mattie. [door knob rattles] Let me in! [door knob rattling] - [Miss Emily] Is she dead? Not yet, but she's dying. - [Miss Emily] I want to talk to Mr. Loomis. - Don't be crazy! You keep your mouth shut! [door closes] [knocking on door] - Miss Emily, may I speak with you? [knocking on door] [door opens] Miss Emily, can you tell me what happened? [door opens] [cane tapping] [footsteps descending staircase] [door closes] [no audio] [typing on typewriter] [tense music] [typing continues] [suspenseful music] [cane slams] [typing stops] - Mother? - I don't wanna leave you. I'm sorry. I don't wanna go away and leave you alone. I don't know what'll happen to you if you're left all alone. I'm afraid. I don't wanna go away. I don't wanna leave you. I wanna stay with... [gasps] [somber music] [tense music] - What did you want to say to me, Miss Emily? Did you kill my wife? I saw you at the window. - Leave her alone. She's frightened. I'll take care of her. [tense music] [tense music continues] [tense music continues] [quick footsteps] [suspenseful music] [suspenseful music continues] [suspenseful music continues] [suspenseful music continues] - What did you want to tell me, Miss Emily? [quick footsteps] [quick footsteps] [dress tears] [dramatic music] [dramatic music continues] [dramatic music continues] [dramatic music continues] [dramatic music continues] [Miss Emily exhales] - Hey! Where do you think you're going? [dramatic music] - What were you gonna tell Mr. Loomis? What were you going to tell him? - You were letting them blame me! - They would've forgiven you! - You killed her with papa's ashes! I was gonna tell him the truth! - I did it for you! - No! - I did it for you, just like always! Everything I've got has been for you! How would you have lived all these years if it hadn't been for me? - I never asked you to take care of me! - Someone had to take care of you! You wouldn't go out of your flat! - You wouldn't let me go out! - That's not true! [suspenseful music] - Mr. Loomis! [suspenseful music] [Mattie grunting] [suspenseful music] - Watch out! [Mattie and Miss Emily grunting] - You killed my wife, didn't you? - You heard what the man said. Keep moving. - She did it, didn't she? - She killed her with papa's ashes! - I said keep moving! - What did she ever do to you? Why did you do it? Why? What did she ever do to you? - Not to me, to us! She was frightened! She was running away! She would've told someone and spoiled everything! I had to kill her! It's not like she was the only one. - But she was one of us. - The others were different. - It doesn't make any sense. If we start killing each other... - You had no right to kill Mrs. Loomis. - No! You be careful. I'll kill the old man too. I'll kill any of you if you don't let me alone! [diners chattering and laughing] [chattering stops] [tense music] - Coffee? Hey! What's the idea? What's the idea of sitting down at a table if you don't want anything? [tense music] [tense music continues] [fountain gushing] [suspenseful music] [cane tapping] - She was gonna tell somebody! I had to kill her! That's why I killed her! Because she was... [panting] [suspenseful music] [truck rumbling] [brakes screeching] - Why don't you watch where you're going! - Is she all right? Can I help? - I think she's all right. Nothing broken, is there? Nothing in the matter? We'll take care of her. [birds chirping] [children chattering and laughing] [quick footsteps] - Get me outta here! [cane tapping] [paddles whirring] [paddles whirring] [paddles whirring] [suspenseful music] [suspenseful music continues] [suspenseful music continues] [suspenseful music continues] [Mattie shouts] [water splashes] [water bubbling] [splashing stops] [soft music] [no audio] [wrecking ball slams] [debris clatters] [machine rumbling] [wrecking ball slams] [wrecking ball slams] [wrecking ball slams] [wrecking ball slams] [cart creaking] [wrecking ball slams] [wrecking ball slams] [debris clatters] [machine rumbling] [wrecking ball slams] [debris clatters] [wrecking ball slams] [fuse crackling] [quick footsteps] [wrecking ball slams] [building explodes] [debris clattering] [low rumbling] [somber music] [somber music continues] [somber music continues] [somber music continues] - We need a place to stay. - You're wasting your time here. I got plenty of space, but they're tearing this building down in a couple of months. Didn't you see the sign out there? We've been condemned. They're tearing all these flats down. Gonna build big apartments for rich people. We don't know where we're going to go. - Why should we go anywhere? Why do you let them push us around? Why can't we fight back? We got as much right here as anyone else. - Oh, be quiet. I'm sorry. You're wasting your time here. We got our own troubles. - I think we'll move in for a while anyhow. - Maybe we can help.
