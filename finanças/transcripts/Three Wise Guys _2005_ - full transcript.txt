( music playing ) - Can I get your cab, sir? - No. - Can I help you with your bag? - I said no. No is no. Don't touch the bag. Well, a very merry Christmas to you, too, sir. Yeah. Hey, come back here. You know what? You're right. - Merry Christmas. - Same to you, sir. All right, now get out of my face. - Oh. - Go ahead. Sir. Yes, sir. Can I help you? Yes, you can. - This car won't do. - This is a good car. - It's very fast. - I need a bigger trunk. So what's it gonna be? You coming to the party? Well, I'd love to, but you know I'm here on business. I'll see you soon. Bye, girls. All right, yo. Let's go, ladies' man. Murray's waiting. - Can't be late for the job. - ( tires screech ) ♪ Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way ♪ ♪ Oh, what fun it is to ride in an one-horse open sleigh ♪ ♪ Jingle bells, jingle bells... ♪ Woman: So Mr. Crown invites all the employees. - Woman #2: Well, when you own the casino... - Right, yeah. I said Virgin Mary extra spicy. Yes, sir. Sorry. ( cell phone ringing ) Here you go, folks. Compliments of Murray Crown. Yeah. No, flight was okay. No, no. Not too bumpy. So how are the kids? Yeah, what'd he do? Yeah, well, you tell him if he doesn't want coal in his stocking and a rap on his head, he better start listening. ( laughs ) And your names are... Mistletoe. This is Zuzu. Ah, I'm Joey. Merry Christmas. So, uh, have you been good girls this year? No, we've been very naughty. ( chuckles ) Naughty's nice. - Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho. - Thanks for throwing the party, Mr. Crown. Tell the boss what you want for Christmas, sweet cakes. - Can I tell you in private? - Would you, please? - ( laughs ) - Murray. - Oh! - Run along, sweetheart. Only Mommy kisses Santa Claus this year. Okay, go find something else. Go on. - Oh. They're here. - Oh. Humbug. Humbug is right. Yeah, what can I tell you, Charley? I tried to do what I could, but we both know who the real Scrooge is around here. Yeah, Murray Crown. Hello, Murray. - Hey. - And, Shirley, can I just say how beautiful you look this evening? Well, why not? You'd only be telling the truth. Leo, let me buy you a glass of eggnog, okay? Okay. - We had a good year. - A great year. - A banner year. - And a lot of the credit goes to you. - Ah. - Seriously, you are my oldest and most trusted friend. And because of that, I've got a little bit of holiday cheer from me to you. Murray, I don't know what to say. And that ain't all, as an added bonus, this is Sindy with an S. - Okay, you'll need this. - Oh, Murray. Now, Sindy, he's got a weak heart, so first couple rounds, take a little something off of it, all right? - I'll take care of him. - Merry Christmas, Leo. - All right, I got to go. - Oh, no. - Yeah. - You sure? - To remember me by. - Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. - Here you go. - Thanks. - What? - Come on. ( knocks on door ) Hope you don't mind, I ordered champagne and caviar. Why would I mind? It's Murray's dime. So which one of you's caviar? Little joke. Tough room. So what can I do for you fellas? Murray sent us. Yeah, well, no offense, but I gotta tell ya, I much preferred the lovely Sindy with an S. - Where is he? - Who? - The little drummer boy. - Marley. The yutz from the lounge? But-- what's the matter, he didn't show up for work tonight? No, Leo, he didn't. And last night, he telephoned Murray. Said he had information about the casino's financial shenanigans over the past few years. - Is that right? - Yeah. He also said if Murray didn't come up with $125,000, he was gonna feed that info to the feds. Which wouldn't be good for Murray. And either way, it definitely ain't good for you, buttercup, 'cause Murray knows that information could only come from you. Look, on my mother's-- I don't know what you're talking about. I swear. ( laughing ) I'm sorry. It's-- I've got to warn you, I'm extremely ticklish. Yeah, come on. Oh, no. No, what are you gonna do to me? Leo, it's Christmas, better it be a surprise. But I can tell you this much, you really ain't gonna like it. No! Help! Oh! ( laughing ) Is this funny to you? No, I'm sorry, fellas. When I'm nervous, I have a tendency to make jokes. Yeah, but, see, that wasn't a joke, Leo. A joke is a guy walks into a bar. A joke is this guy and Cindy Crawford were stranded on a desert island. - I didn't know that one. - You don't know that one? It's a classic. George, you know that one, yeah? Hey, I got one. And I think you're gonna like-- ( groaning ) What?! Did he just die?! - What the-- see if he's dead. - Wait, why me? What, afraid of a little dead body? Yup. He's dead. I don't care how it happened. Get rid of the body and you find the drummer. And do it now, okay? Hi. Happy holidays. Happy holidays. Good luck. Good luck. Happy holidays to you guys. How are we gonna find the drummer now? And to think right now I could be under Mistletoe. What the hell's that? - It's a falling star. - You mean a meteor. - A what? - That's what we call falling stars, meteors. Burning up as they're entering Earth's atmosphere. It could be a flying saucer. I hear they use the desert out here as a landing strip. Whatever it is, here it comes. ( helicopter blades whirring ) Man on P.A.: Attention, you have entered a restricted military zone. Leave the area immediately. Come on, let's go. Go! Come on, Joey. Close it, come on. Come on, let's go. Move it! - Okay, I think we're clear. - All right. You can turn the headlights on now. Come on. Both: George, look out! Joey: Look out, George! Look out! ( tires screeching ) ( all yelling ) George! ( engine stalls ) Are you okay? Somebody could've been killed. Somebody still might be. I'm sorry. My car overheated and my cell phone doesn't work and I ran out of water and if you hadn't stopped-- ( crying ) - Hey, why you crying? - It's not her fault. She's just experiencing a little hormonal imbalance. Perfectly natural after the sixth month, right, honey? Thank you. Do you have children? Yes, I have five. We're shooting for six. So when are you due, hon? Next month. I was hoping for a Christmas baby, but... - Eh, as long as they're healthy, right? - Right. Hey, I don't mean to interrupt this Kodak moment, but what are you doing out here? - My radiator is shot. -( cell phone chimes ) Yeah, and thanks to you, so is our battery. Guys, she's freaking right about these cell phones. May I? So what are you doing out here in the middle of nowhere? Well, my husband is at Camp MacArthur and I was on my way to see him. So you're married. Yes. So where's your wedding ring? I had to hock it. Now I have a baby on the way. You got a real way with the ladies, huh? - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah, yeah. So what's your name, hon? Mary. Mary Ann Davidson. Mary Ann Davidson. Where you from? Do you know Sweetwater, Iowa? Sweetwater? No. That's where I'm from. I ran away to make it big on the Strip. You know, name in lights, star on the door. What I got was a job selling watered-down drinks to insurance salesmen from Cheboygan. ( chuckles ) And now you're pregnant. ( chuckles ) Yeah. So you gonna raise the kid in Vegas? I don't see how that could possibly be any of your business. Yeah, you're right. Forget I asked. So what are you guys doing out here? - What are we doing out here? - Uh... We're, um, what you call it? - Astronomers. - Astronomers, yeah. Yeah, you know, we're just out stargazing. You know, that's, uh, that's what we do. It's what we do. Beautiful, huh? ( bird screeching ) George: Okay, give it a shot. ( engine clicking ) Modern, stupid damn cars. She's beautiful, isn't she? Yeah, don't let her fool you. That's when they're the most dangerous. When they're sleeping. Next thing you know, they got their arms around you... - Mm-hmm. - ...hold you. - What, do you got a problem with intimacy? - Nah, I love intimacy. As long as it ends before 9:00 the next morning. Hey, guys, somebody's gonna have to go for help. And when I say somebody, I mean you, Joey. What? Why me? - Seniority, kid. - Look, you'll get to the highway eventually. Gee, thanks, George. Here, you take this. St. Joseph. Patron saint of husbands. You don't have to believe in it. Just wear it. All right. All right. - Wish me luck. - Good luck. ( bell dinging ) Ahem. What is it? Astronomers, huh? ( braying ) It's a kid. Put 'em down. What happened to your car? Battery shorted. Did you shoot it? Yeah, yeah. How far to the next gas station? What's wrong with that car over there? Radiator blew. It's got a battery, doesn't it? - Joey, go get that battery. - ( stammers ) - Go ahead. Just do it. - Right, right, yeah. Seniority, I got it. All right. Try it now. - ( engine starts ) - Huh? All right, let's go, guys. Let's go, let's go. - Huh? - Whoo! - Yeah. - We did it. - That's right. - Hey, kid, here's a little something for your... trouble. What? Come on. Let's go. Man on P.A.: This is the final call for all passengers departing on the westbound bus to San Francisco with connection to Los Angeles, platform eleven. Oh. You have to give me your address. I'll send you a check. - Forget about it. - Merry Christmas, hon. - Oh, no. I can't. - For the baby. You all have been so kind to me. I don't know how to thank you. How 'bout a hug? Come on. Can I tell you a secret? You're almost as cute as you think you are. Man on P.A.: All passengers holding tickets for bus 23 bound for Iowa, please board now, platform five. Bus 23 for Iowa, please board now, platform five. - Sweet kid, huh? - There's something about her. Yeah, it's called way too much attitude. - That's not what I mean. - I must have left my watch in the car. - What time is it, huh? - It's, uh... - My wallet. - No, no, no. That little thief. Come on! Excuse me, excuse me. Hey, Joey, go ahead. I got the next one. - Go ahead, Joey. I got the next one. - I got this one. Excuse me, officer. Have you seen a pregnant lady? - Sorry. - I just lost my wife, you know? - Joey: Ah! - Vincent: She's gone! - This is your fault. - Why me? - ( cell phone ringing ) -( man on P.A. ) ( mumbles ) Hello. Yeah, Murray. How you doing? Yeah. Nah, everything's fine. Yeah. - Hey, Murray. - You guys take care of our little problem? - Absolutely. - Yeah, yeah. Leo's sleeping with the scorpions. That's good. Then why's he in a hospital room lying in a coma? That's impossible. He was dead, right? What am I, a doctor? He looked dead, he felt dead. Well, if he wakes up and starts talking to the feds, I am gonna be dead. Wait, Murray. Maybe he wakes up and doesn't say anything. Right. Why would he? He thinks I sent you guys to kill him, for God's sakes. If he comes to, he's gonna sing like Sinatra. We'll cross that bridge later. Right now, I need you to bring me Marley. And I need you to find Stella for me. - Stella? - Stella. Stella Destaid. She's my girl. Well, she was my girl till that damn drummer tricked her head all around and talked her into doing this. I found a note that she wrote this morning. She's got a disc with all the financial stuff I don't want the feds to know about. And she thinks having it will keep me from hurting her or Jake. - The little drummer boy's name is Jake? - Yes. - Jacob Marley? - Yes, why? No reason. Okay, I want Marley's chestnuts roasting on that open fire by Christmas morning. And I need you to bring Stella back to me. But she did this. What if she doesn't want to? - What do you mean? - We'll take care of it. - Shirley: Murray. Murray, honey. - Good. Where are your manners? We have guests. You don't offer refreshments? Please, you know, I baked these personally. - Oh, thanks, Mrs. C. - Call me Shirley, hon. - All right. - Thanks, Shirley, hon. - Sprinkles are my favorite. - Oh, very good. - George? - I'll pass. - Do you have diabetes? - No. Eat the cookie. All right, now, everybody, sit. Go on, sit. Don't mind Murray. He loves the holidays, don't you, Murray? - Yeah. - Peace on Earth, goodwill to man. Tom Jones, two shows nightly. Some dentist from Scottsdale's counting cards on table one. Diego, table one. That's right. You see him? Okay, do not make me do your job for you! Oh, you see how stressed out he gets? At his age. Now, look, boys, I want you to make sure that my Murray has a very merry Christmas. So you find that drummer. We will. - All right, boys. - See ya. - Bye, sweetheart. - Bye. She finds out about Stella, I'm gonna be mincemeat. Vincent, I'll tell ya, I feel bad for you 'cause I know you want to be home with your family 'cause it's the holidays, but you finish this job right, there's gonna be a nice bonus in your Christmas stocking. - Thanks, Murray. - And if you screw it up, I'm gonna send you back to them in little teeny tiny gift-wrapped boxes. All right, now when you find Stella, be gentle because-- well, as you can see, she's very, very beautiful. Do not try to muscle her 'cause she don't like that. You gotta be nice, you gotta be sweet. You gotta force her to come back to me of her own free will. She is pregnant with my child. And you know I've always wanted to have kids. I mean, it's like a Christmas miracle. So get her back, guys. Okay? ( groans ) There's still time for me to make it back home, but we've got to work quick and we've got to work smart. All right, so you got any ideas? I got plenty of ideas. My Delores, when she was in her third trimester, she couldn't stop eating or spending. - All right? - Okay, so... - What do you mean, so? Come on. - Credit cards. ( bell rings ) Vincent: I can't believe I didn't see it coming. I told you that you can never trust a woman. Not even a pregnant one. - Well, you know, it's-- - No, no, no. I spoke to American Express. Vincent was right. She's been running up our credit cards like she's married to Donald Trump. - What did I tell ya? - Clothes, food, a rental car. - Where'd she rent the car? - Thrifty. - From Flamingo? - Yeah. Gentlemen, I've got this one. Go get 'em, killer. - What are you drinking? - It's a rum and Coke. - Isn't that Delores' drink? - Yeah. I miss her. And the kids. - Delores. - Delores. Oh, yeah. Woman: So this tells you all about the supplemental liability insurance you got. - Okay? - Man: Sounds good. - Woman: Have a good day. - You, too. - Hey. - Reservation number? What, I need a reservation to talk to you? - Name? - My name's Joey. What's yours? Nina. That's a beautiful name. So, Nina, um, I was wondering if you could help me. I'm looking for someone. What's her name? You would remember her, she goes out to here. Yours? No, no. Definitely not. I'm just helping out a friend. A good Samaritan, huh? Well, it's Christmas. We do what we can. She was here just a while ago. ( computer beeping ) Got the premium package, maximum coverage, one-way drop-off. And where was she headed again? She didn't say. But she did take a map and asked for directions. All right, where to? - Pahrump. - Pah-what? Pahrump. West of here on the way to Death Valley. Okay. Nina, you're a doll. You know, we're offering a holiday special this week. Oh, yeah? So what's the special? - Me. - You? Well, I'll bet you are special. But I really gotta go. I'll see you around. ♪ 'Tis the season to be jolly ♪ ♪ Fa-la-la-la, la-la-la-la ♪ ♪ Don we now our gay apparel ♪ - ♪ Fa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la ♪ - ( horn honking ) Crap. ♪ Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la ♪ ♪ Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la ♪ ♪ Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la ♪ ♪ Follow me in merry measure ♪ ♪ Fa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la ♪ ♪ While I tell of Yuletide treasure ♪ ♪ Fa-la-la-la-la-- - Small world. - Small, big, it doesn't really matter. We would've found you if you'd taken off from Mars, Stella. So Murray sent you. My name's not Stella. It's Mary. Yeah, whatever you call yourself. I want my watch back. - Yeah, me, too. Come on. - Where's the disc? It's in my purse. - There you go. - Ah. Listen to me, I was desperate and I had to get away. Yeah, the tears are a nice touch. If you hadn't gotten knocked up, you probably would've been a star. Everything I told you is true. Oh, yeah? You mean like, uh, Sweetwater, Iowa. There is no Sweetwater, sweetheart. - George checked. - Okay. And the husband in the army? Okay. But this is real. This is the realest thing that's ever happened to me. And I'm going to do whatever I can to protect this child. What, by stealing from Murray Crown? Have you ever been in love? Yeah, sure, I have. Fortunately, it's always only been temporary. - Then I feel sorry for you. - Yeah. - Bingo. - This the only copy? Yeah. It's a read-only. Can't be copied. Okay, well, you boys got what you want. Merry Christmas. - I need my keys because I have to go. - Not so fast. A woman in your condition shouldn't be driving around the desert. - Why don't you come with us? - I really don't want to go with you. Nothing's going to happen to you or your kid. - I'm not going back to Murray! - Get in the car! - We're not taking you to Murray. - Get in the car! At least not yet. - First, you're going to take us to the daddy. - Who? Murray thinks he's the father, but it's the drummer's, isn't it? Look, you got what you want. You got me, you got the disc, you don't need Jake. Well, we need Jake because Murray wants Jake. And what Murray wants, Murray gets. I won't do it. And I know what you're gonna do to him. Look at it this way, you don't have a choice. Get in. Let's go. Get in the car. How many times do I gotta say that? Get my purse. Put your seat belt on for the baby. - ( engine starts ) - Come on, Joey. Murray will send somebody to get the car. So is it a boy or a girl? I don't know. Well, what does your doctor say? Huh? You do have a doctor? What's it to you? You're always going on about your wife and kids. If you're such a family man, what are you doing with these two? I can tell that you'd rather be with your family. Come on, it's Christmas. The carols, the tree. Oh, and the kids running down the stairs ready to open their presents. Boy, it's a shame you're going to have to miss all that. - You know what I'm thinking? - What, Vincent? I'm thinking that if we can find this boyfriend of yours and get rid of him real quick, I can still make it home in time for Christmas. -( Joey and George laughing ) - ( crying ) Yeah, nice try, sweetheart. - Oh, okay. Here we go. - It's the hormones talking. There's nothing you can do about it. Whatever, just somebody shut her up. Or what? You'll get rid of me, too? Is he always like this? Now that you mention it, he's even worse at Christmas. Yeah, why is that, Georgie? When you were a kid, did you catch Mommy kissing Santa Claus? - I'm an orphan. - No kidding, huh? What happened to your folks? My mother and father were murdered in their sleep on Christmas Eve. - Oh, my God. - That really happened? Your parents really got popped on Christmas Eve? - No. - ( scoffs ) That's not funny. You're sick, man. That's not funny. Um, you have to stop. - No. - That's not funny. - Mary: No, no, no. - No, no, no. No, look, I mean it. I have to go. You have to stop. I'll go in the car. My Delores in her eighth month, she was like a leaky faucet. George, I think you better pull over. Mary: You gotta be kidding me. You can get back in the car. We should keep an eye on her. Where's she gonna go? Eh, you got a point. Dear... God. Okay. All right. - All right? - Yeah. - Joey, I'm sorry-- - We're not stopping again. - Use a cup. - I'm hungry. If I don't eat something, I'm gonna pass out. She's right. My Delores in her eighth month-- - Fine! - I'm just saying. Fine! Can I take your order? Okay, so I want two burritos. One beef, one chicken. I want a taco salad and I want a side order of beans and rice. - Do you have ice cream? -Mm-hmm. Okay, good. I want three scoops of vanilla. I want some apple pie. - Ooh, and I want a pickle. Do you have fries? - Yeah. Okay, good. What, you guys aren't eating? - Oh. - What's the matter? - Um, I don't feel so good. - That's a surprise. - She don't look too good, George. - I think it's the baby. - Vincent: Huh? -I think it's the baby. - You sure? Is it cramps? - Uh-huh. - Like a fist that's opening and closing? - Uh-huh. - I think she's having contractions. - Give me a break. - It's a trick. - Hey, how do you know? - She's pale and she's in pain. - ( groaning ) And she needs to see a doctor. She'll see a doctor when we get to Pahrump. Hey, anything happens to her, Murray ain't gonna be too happy. Come on, honey. You all right? Murray did say he didn't want anything to happen to her. ( tires screeching ) ( Mary groans ) Oh, we gotta hurry. Come on, honey. Let's go. - Oh, please. - Take it easy. ( groaning continues ) Excuse me, nurse. We got a pregnant lady here. Two big men for one pretty lady? - My baby. - Don't worry, hon. Babies are what we do best. - Who's the daddy? - He is. Don't worry, I haven't lost a father yet. Oh, why is he here? I don't want him here. Come on, Daddy, take her hand. Talk to her. Did you pick the names? - Names? -Something Christmas-y like Holly or Ivy or Eve would be nice. You know, Holly's not that bad. Yeah. And if it's a boy, we could call him Rudolph. ( laughs ) - Or Jake. - I'll get Dr. Ames. ( groaning ) Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. You're cutting off my circulation. Please don't go. I'm not going anywhere. Hey, you skipped out on us once already. I'm not going to be fooled by your little charades again. Do you really think that I'm faking this? Well, let's just say I wouldn't put it past you. Here, murder this one for a while. So let me ask you, why'd you run out on Murray? Oh, my God. Why do you care? I don't. You know, it's just he's rich. I'm sure he could've taken care of you and the kid. All you had to do was say that it was his. Look, he doesn't want me. He doesn't want the baby. It's his pride. - That's what I took from him. - Right, right. And this drummer guy, is he worth it? Again, why do you care? Hey, look, lady, I don't care, okay? It's just that this Marley character - doesn't sound like a very good bet. - ( yells ) How can you say that about someone you don't even know? First of all, messing with Murray Crown? That alone ain't the smartest of moves. - Help. - But what the hell? He took his shot, right? But then he went and dragged you into it. Put you and your kid's necks on the line. And that is something I never would've done. Yeah, see, if I was in love with you, I would never put you in danger. 'Cause I wouldn't want someone like me coming after you. You know, I'm starting to get the crazy idea that you're not such a creep. Yeah. Well, I would be a bad bet, too. You know, you don't have to do this. You could just let me go. Oh, not again. ( screams ) Oh, come on! You know, you're a pretty good actress. - ( panting ) - But you can stop all this 'cause I have a job to do and I'm gonna do it. And all the tears in China ain't gonna change that one bit. Are you kidding me?! I'm Dr. Ames. How we doing today? Dad, will you give us a minute? Thanks. What do you think about Holly? Who's Holly? ( door opens ) - False alarm. - I told you it was all an act. He's very anxious. Eh, expectant uncle. Contractions were real, but she could still be a week away. - Braxton-Hicks syndrome. - That's right. - She can go now? - I'd like to keep her for another couple of hours just in case. - All right, thanks, Doc. - All right. I hate hospitals. Nothing but sick people. Vincent: Hey, Mary's not sick, she's just pregnant. Yeah, she's a knocked-up, second-rate showgirl-- Hey, watch your mouth. Why should I? I'm just saying. What is it with you two? I can see that she's pretty. I understand she's in a delicate condition, but the fact is, she ripped us off. Not just Murray, us. All she does is bat her baby blues and you guys are gonna be washing diapers? Hey, diapers are disposable, George. If we don't find the drummer, we are disposable, too.

What am I gonna do now? What am I gonna do? ( sighs ) I'm done. I'm finished. I'm kaput. I'm up the river. I'm up the... Oh, my Lord. Would you look at her? Yes, you. Come here. Right down to the belly and everything. Look at this. Oh, and it's real. Oh, glory, hallelujah. You're a miracle, girl. You can act, can't you? It doesn't matter. Ruth, boys and girls, ladies and gentlemen, I give you our new Virgin Mary. ( applause ) You are gonna be great. You're perfect. Oh, oh, oh. Hey, hey, where you going? - We can't go in there. - Why not? It's a church, man. - What, are you superstitious? - Very. The past five years I've played Mary, but as you can see... I'm Pastor Roberts. Can we help you? We're looking for her. I'm the father. Oh... oh, no, he is not. It's the hormones talking. Honey, I was wrong. I should have never said those things that I said. I just-- I want you to forgive me. Darling, please. You gotta understand, I want you to come back. I need you to come home. Home? Do you even know what home is? Or love? Or commitment? I had to get away from him. And there were no rooms at the Desert Inn. I need a place to stay and I was wondering if there was a shelter at your church. We can't have our Mary staying in the shelter. Well, it's better than a stable. You can stay with Ruth and I. - Oh, no, I couldn't. - Mary, we insist. Go on now. You need to be taken care of. Homeless, friendless, yet in her womb lies the hope of the world. God, I love that. Okay, folks, remember, rehearsal's 9:00 tomorrow morning, okay? Sharp, sharp, sharp. I mean, she can't stay in there forever. Can always just go in and blast 'em. Well, there's the Christmas spirit. ( chuckles ) You know, I bet she makes a very good Mary. Yeah, she got the virgin thing down. - ( cell phone ringing ) - Eh, cell phones. Yeah, hi, hon. I'm okay. Yes, I'm taking my pills. - My bowels are good. - Ew! No, I mean, everything is normal. Ain't love grand? Hey, you ever wonder what it's like? Wife, kids, a Christmas tree. She ain't worth it. Who? You know who I mean. - ( door opens ) - Vincent: Yeah. I love you, too. I hate this. I really should be home with the family and not doing this... this stuff, you know? Hey, Vincent. You ever think about doing anything else? Teach. I'd be a teacher. Elementary teacher. What, little Johnny doesn't bring in his homework, you cut his thumbs off? - Hey, I think you'd make a good teacher. - Yeah, thanks, Joey. - Thanks. - Just until someone makes him angry. Do you want to do the honors? I don't think she loves him. Who? Mary. I don't think she's in love with the drummer. Baby's father or not. It's just a feeling I got. - Getting your hopes up? - That's not what I'm saying, George. I'm saying if she don't love him, maybe she don't go to him. - Which would mean... - That we don't get to him in time. But-- but if she still had the disc, maybe she'd do it just for the dollar signs, right? I mean, that's what I would do. - Yeah. - It's worth a try, right? Not bad. Knock yourself out, kid. ( laughs ) Look at this guy. Sit down. Practice makes perfect. Yeah. Look at that. All right. Hey. What do you think? Oh, he likes it. It's kind of hard to make a mistake. Oh, you haven't met my parents. Oh, don't be so hard on yourself. You're good people. I can tell. Have you ever been wrong? Once, but I married him anyway. ( knocks on door ) Do not let him in. He's the father of your child, isn't he? For your baby's sake. God bless you, ma'am. Hello, Mary. I hope it's not too late. For us, I mean. After all... it's Christmas. All right, pick yourself an ornament there. Oh, that's a nice one. Good job. Nick, grab one there. Right on the table. Thatagirl. Up you go. All right, hang that on that tree there. - Honey, uh... - Excuse me. Pastor Roberts: Careful, Nick. Good job. There you go. Your husband has a way with children. Oh, he's a real charmer. Like any snake. Look, Pastor, you've been very kind, but we really gotta get going. Oh, Joey, you gotta stay for supper. - We'd love to. - We-- Whatever you say, dear. Pastor Roberts: Then it's settled. Dinner it is. Daddy, we forgot the angel. Oh, the angel, yeah. Um, angel. You ready? Pick her up. Thatagirl. Good job. All right, for the best part now. Are you guys ready? Okay, all right. Lights, camera, Christmas. - ( gasps ) - ( cheering ) Mrs. Roberts: Merry Christmas, sweetheart. - I love you. - I love you, too. - What the hell is he doing in there? - I don't know. But they do a very nice tree. My oldest, Nick, was pouring ketchup all over the head of the other two. - No. - I'm not kidding. You've got to watch them every second. - Thank you. - Hey, ladies. - I'd like to help out. - Be our guest. - All right. - I'll leave you two lovebirds to it. - All right. - Can you believe her? Yeah, well, what about the pastor quizzing us on the reindeer? Yeah, well, I can't believe you didn't know who Vixen was. - Vixen? - Vixen. Vixen, okay. Yeah, well, that shows how much you know. - Hmm. - ( water running ) I say they are way too nice. ( sighs ) Yeah, you know, I spent most of my life running away from people like that. Christmas, huh? Thank God it only comes once a year. Yeah. Well, once is one time too many. Even though my old man, he loved Christmas. He worked for the Anyeli brothers in the North End. On Christmas Eve, he would stop off at Mangione's, pick up a platter of shells and sauce, some calamari, a little scampi. Nice case of wine. God, we ate like kings. Then my father, he would sit down at the piano. We'd all sing Silent Night. Where was your mother through all this? That's a good question. She, uh, she took off when I was five. I never saw her again. I'm really sorry. Eh, what can you do? But my father, he was great. He always made sure we had all the presents we ever wanted. Yeah, it was the exact opposite with us. We never really had a happy holiday. We had more fighting than fun. But, you know, I still always loved Christmas. I always thought next year would get better, you know? When you're a kid, you still want to believe in sugarplum fairies and Santa Claus. Then life kind of gets in the way. Yeah. Yeah, I know what you mean. Do you? Ahem. Excuse me. - Oh, uh, hey, I got you something. - Yeah? Yeah, you know, for Christmas. Hmm. Is it ticking? Come on, open it. Oh. Oh, it's adorable. Oh, I don't know what to say. Eh, well, don't say anything. Here you go. Let me show you your room. Our room. Come on, darling. The bathroom is the first door on the right. - Here you go. - Thank you. Wow. Honey, doesn't this remind you of that cute little B and B we stayed at up in Tahoe? Well, if you need extra blankets, they're in the closet. - Okay, thank you. - Good night. Good night. So you wanna leave... leave. George and Vincent are right outside. I'm sure they'd be happy to give you a ride. I think I'll stay right here. Okay, fine. So, uh, what's your preference? About? Do you prefer the right side or the left? Very funny. You're a funny guy. Oh, what? You think I'd try anything with you like that? I wouldn't put it past ya as long as I had a pulse. Yeah, well, even if I did try anything, it would only be for your benefit. Excuse me? Yeah, yeah. I've heard all about you pregnant women who are close to giving birth. You get all kinds of crazy and you like a man to attend to your, you know, needs. If I was climbing the walls insane with desire, you'd be the last man I'd even consider. Okay, okay. You made your point. You know, sometimes you're not a very nice person. Wow. That hurt. Coming from a hit man. Okay, well, I'm going to bed. No, no, no, no, no. You're not going to bed. You are sleeping on the floor. - On the floor? - On the floor. Okay, look, I would sleep on the floor if that's what you really want-- Believe me, that is what I really want. I can't. I can't sleep on the floor. Doctor's orders. I got allergies. Fine. But you stay way over there. And none of these clothes are coming off. I swear to God, if you try anything... Yeah, well, you got nothing to worry about. Can I get a kiss good night? I'd rather have morning sickness. Okay, why do you gotta say that? I mean, why do you got to hurt my feelings like that? - Do you even have feelings? - Well, do you? How do you think I got into this situation in the first place? You know what? Go to sleep. I am warning you, I bite. - Really? - Good night. Shut the light off. You moved. I told you not to move. My arm fell asleep. Cut it off. ( whispers ) Joey. So I, uh, I changed my mind. You know, if you wanna... you know... ( snoring ) - Huh? - Let's go. ( car starts ) George: All righty. - Joey: Are we good? - George: Locked and loaded. Need a lift? - Hey, thanks for stopping. - No problem. ( beeping ) Hey, Joey, I owe you an apology. For a minute back there, I thought you'd fallen for her. - Happy holidays. - Same to you. ( phone rings ) - Hello? - Yeah, hey, Murray. Oh, hello, Mrs. C. Murray's not here. Can I help you, Joseph? Uh, yeah, could you give him a message? Tell him we think we found that Christmas gift he was looking for. A gift? What's the gift? Uh, I really can't tell you. It's supposed to be a surprise. Oh, well, I love surprises. Just tell me, is this a Christmas gift for me? Uh, look, I really can't tell you, Mrs. C. Oh, come on. It's Shirley. Just give me a hint. Where you picking this gift up? Neiman's? Cartier? It's a little place called the Aztec in Pahrump. What? Mrs. C, yeah, just give him the message, would ya, sweetheart? Yeah, I'll tell him, honey. All right, thanks, hon. - I didn't-- - What's the matter with you? Hey, you don't need to raise your hand to me, all right? It's-- ow, ow! - Hello? - Mary: About time. - Hey, Stella. - Hello, Jake. ( door closes ) Baby, I'm so glad to see you. Hey, sweetheart. Come on. There, baby. What? What? What's the matter? If you knew what I have been through... Oh, sweetheart, I know. I know and I want to hear all about it. Okay? I do. But first things first, hon. Did you bring it? The disc. That's what you ask me first? Not how am I or how's the baby? Look, babe, you know all that stuff goes without saying. - You know I love you. - ( sighs ) You know I love kids, all right? We just need this insurance policy, all right? - Just in case Murray comes after us. - Oh, he tried. What? Yeah. He sent three wise guys. So where are they? ( sighs ) What, you got away from them, hmm? ( laughs ) Couldn't have been the wisest of wise guys. Or maybe I'm smarter than you think. Hey, ahem, excuse me. Did I ever say you were dumb, ever, huh? Why would you even say that? Why would you even say that, baby? Come here. Hmm? You know I don't think that. Angel. So where is it, huh? This really is all you care about, isn't it? What are you talking about? If you gave a damn about me, you wouldn't have gotten me involved. You would have kept me and the baby out of it, Jake. And I would have if there would have been any other way, Stella. - All right? - It's Mary. You gotta believe me on this, but what is that? - This? - Yeah, this. This is a present. - A present? A present from who? - No one. It's one of the wise guys. Wise guys? Excuse me. - Murray Crown says hello. - Hey, fellas. I should have known. Even your presents are poison. Yeah, yeah. Where's the disc? Look, fellas, I don't know how much Murray's paying you, but-- Hey, hey! Wait a minute! Back pocket, back pocket, back pocket! - Give it to him. - Hey, I got it. - All right? - All right, shut up now. You didn't think we'd give you back the real disc, did you? Okay, what now? - Now we take you to Murray. - Why bother? Why don't you go ahead and kill us both right now and get it over with? - Hey, wait a minute! - Hey. You aren't the father of the child. - All right, all right, let's go. - ( sighs ) Let's go. Get up. - Let 'em go. - What? I just schlepped all the way from Vegas, don't make me ask twice. So, uh, what brings you to Pahrump, Mrs. C? It is Shirley, remember? What do you want? For now, I would like everybody to just sit down. - George: Sit down. - Vincent: Yeah. - You just told me to stand. - You heard her. - Sit down. - Thank you. Thank you. Now, I brought cookies. Here, honey, have a cookie. I haven't put any arsenic in these... yet. Jake, I'm sure you need a cookie. Sure. Does Murray know we're here? If he did, your heart would be in your throat, literally. All right. You asked me what I want, I want Murray. He may be a fool, but he is my fool. And I have to keep him safe from the feds and from you. Especially from you. Mrs. Crown, I swear, he's all yours. You can have him. I don't love Murray. Murray doesn't love me. Save the saccharine, doll. As long as he thinks that that baby is his, he will never let go. That is why I cannot let them bring you back to Vegas. So what are you saying, Mrs. C? Do you want us to... No. As much as I'd like to, Murray would never forgive me. So here's what we're gonna do. You are gonna write Murray another letter. And you are gonna tell him that that baby is not his and that you will take a paternity test to prove it. Do this, not only will you and Jake and the baby live to see another Christmas, but I am gonna throw in a very nice going-away present. - Hey. - What are you doing? Now, that is enough for you to make a fresh start far away from Murray. Start writing, sweetheart. Hey. ( whistles ) Let's go. What are you waiting on? Mary, Mary, don't do this. Joey, let go of my arm. Listen, Mrs. C, Shirley. Could I get a minute with her? Joey. Please. All right. Make it quick. All right. - What-- what are you doing? - All: Shut your mouth. So you leave with this guy and then what? Well, then Jake and I get the money and this baby will have a future. Ah, come on. You really think this schmuck's gonna stick around? What's my alternative? I go back to Murray? No, no, it doesn't have to be either-or. Okay. Well, what's my third choice? Who's gonna help me raise this baby? - Mary, I-- - You what? - Joey, what? - I can help you. I got money. Yeah? Well, unless you have something else to offer... - Mary... - No. No, no, no. - It's Stella. - ( sighs ) All right, you boys got the disc? You better get back to Vegas. Murray's waiting for it. Yes, but Murray wanted us to bring the two of them back. No, no, no, no, no. I'll take care of Murray. You guys just get going. - Come on. Come on. - You sure? Yeah, I'm just gonna stay here and make sure she does her scribbling. Vincent: You want the cookies, Mrs. C? Shirley: No, you keep 'em. Hey, uh... I hope the three of you will be very happy. Merry Christmas. You keep writing. I'm gonna be right back. Hey, guys. Guys, come here. You know, I really want you to know how much I appreciate all your help. And to show you how much I appreciate it, there will be a nice Christmas bonus in all of your bank accounts. - Thank you. - Yeah, thanks, Mrs. C. - It's Shirley, doll. - Yeah, Shirley, doll. - Yeah, thanks a lot for the cookies. - Yeah, okay. Hey, Joey, come here. So why didn't you tell her? Tell her what? ( sighs ) And you call yourself a wise guy. Joey. Murray's wise guys go bye-bye? - Yeah. - Good. Change of plans, Mrs. C. Oh, crap. Or is it Shirley? It's Mrs. Crown. ( sighs ) Jake. What time's that flight leave? Excellent. Thank you. They got me on the red-eye. All right. Get to spend Christmas, after all, with the family. How wonderful for you. What's the matter, Georgie? Got the holiday blues? Need a hug, pal? - Huh? - I don't think so. You know what you should do? You should come home with me for Christmas. You, too, Joey. We got lots of room. Thanks, Vincent, but I got people waiting for me. He's got people. What's her name? You sure you won't change your mind? - Thanks anyway. - All right, killer. - Have a merry. - Say hi to Delores for me. I will. She'll be disappointed. - Merry Christmas, Vincent. - Thanks a lot, Joey. - Take care, kid. - I'll see you soon. - Change your mind, let me know. - All right. - We got plenty of room. - Thank you. Time to see Murray. - Where should I drop you? - Doesn't matter. - Any place with holiday spirits. - Fair enough. It's from a friend. I, uh, could play hard to get, but what the hell, it's Christmas, right? 'Tis the season. - You look like you could use some holiday cheer. - Ah... So what do you say we go back to my place? Maybe hang my stockings by the chimney with care. - Then... - Those are great stockings. And you're beautiful. ( whispers ) And tonight... you know, I could really use the company. So what do you say? I'd say I'm probably going to hate myself in the morning. ( laughs ) I hope so. Merry Christmas. ( cell phone ringing ) - Yeah, George. -Leo's talking. When did he wake up? - You get Vincent. - No, no, no. Tell Murray I'm on it. Holy Christmas. ( siren blaring ) - Raul. - Woman: Sheriff, join us. - Have a little champagne. - Here. - Cheers. - I don't know about champagne. - Woman: How about a cookie? - A cookie will be just fine. ( machine beeping ) Boo. ( gasps ) Leo, Leo, Leo, Leo. Are you gonna be a good boy? Look, I screwed up. I know I screwed up, but Murray's got nothing to worry about, I swear. I wouldn't rat him out. What were you thinking, huh? Giving her that disc? I was worried about her. When she took up with that Marley joker, I thought Murray was gonna go nuts. I thought he was gonna hurt her. I couldn't let that happen. I didn't want nothing bad to happen to her. ( machine beeping faster ) Yeah, I know the feeling. So she got to you, too, huh? What are you talking about? I'm talking she's a good kid. A sweet kid. Eh, she's nothing but trouble. No, she's in trouble. Well, not anymore. Shirley fixed that. She gave Mary and Marley enough money to live happily ever after. Happily ever after? You think Marley loves her? No. He's only using her. I tried to tell her that from the very beginning. Now that Marley's got his money, he'll probably dump her in the desert. Leave her high and dry. Why should I care what happens to her? 'Cause you already do. I'm not in love with her. - Who says you were? - I'm not. -( machine beeping irregularly ) - ( groaning, gasping ) Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Leo, Leo, Leo. What the hell are you doing? Are you dying? Leo, you can't die. I was supposed to kill you. -( machine flatlining ) - Woman: Crash cart to 15 north, code blue. Crash cart to 15 north, code blue. Got it. Right here. - All right, surging. - Paddles. - Clear. - All right. Man: One, two, three. Man: These are happy times. Woman: Merry Christmas. ( cell phone ringing ) - Yeah, George. - Shirley's missing. - What? - Get downstairs. Vincent: What a Christmas. I was almost on the plane. - So how's my friend Leo? - Leo's not a problem anymore. I didn't think you had it in you. Ye of little faith. Pahrump. I hate drummers. Yeah, you and me both. I really shouldn't be here. I should be home with the family. - ( line ringing ) - Man: Hello? - Okay, I got the money. - The whole 250K? Yes. Of course. Uh, excuse me? That's it? Hell, I was willing to go 250 just to get rid of the skirt. That's all that cheap bastard is gonna cough up for the both of us? Hey, what the hell's she doing? Tell her to shut the hell up. You give me that. Just tell him from me-- - forget it. - Forget what? This whole fiasco. I would rather die than go on living and believing that my Murray would only come up with a buck and a quarter for me. - He's paying 250. - There's two of us, you yutz. - Murray: Shirley, you're killing me! - You got a point. - Oh. - Hey, Murray. Yeah, forgot about the ante, buddy. I'm gonna need another buck 25. Murray: No, no, no. You can't do that. We had a deal and it's Christmas Eve. Hey, it's not me, Murray. It's your blushing bride here. It's the principle of the thing. Can you hear me, Murray? They can hear you in Reno, Shirley! Okay, 375. Where do I take it? Okay, uh, you know the old horse track just north of town? - Yes. - Okay, well, I want you to go there. Yeah. And you better go alone, Murray, 'cause I'm nervous. - Yeah, and nervous is when people get hurt. - Oh, please. So go alone, Murray. I'd hate to have to leave these two under the Christmas tree. - Ha! - Oh, say hello to Murray. - Hello, Murray. - Stella, baby. Murray! - All right, all right. - Jake: Let's go. Stay. You know what, you little pisher? You've been banging those bongos too long. I think it shook something loose in your brain. - Yeah, manna from heaven. - ( groaning ) You actually think that you are gonna pull this off? You know what? I wish there was a bookie around here. I would lay 1,000 to 1 against you. Well, you know what? You're forgetting something. I'm already holding Murray's pair of queens. Open the door. - Get in. - Oh, you're a genius. - Get in. - Make the pregnant lady scoot. - Scoot over. - Couldn't you get a sedan? - Shut up and get in. - Oh, God. Gee, honey, you really know how to pick 'em. - I'm sorry, Mrs. Crown. - Yeah, you should be. I am. I made a mistake. Story of my life. Think I'm without sin? - ( door closes ) - ( engine starts ) ( beeping ) George: They're heading east. Just keep going straight. Out. - Come on. - ( groans ) Stay. - Out. - No. - No? - I am not hopping another step. Go ahead. Shoot me. Okay. Okay. - There. Happy? - Now go get her. - ( chuckles ) - You think this is funny, don't you? - You have got to be kidding me. - What?! If you think I'm walking in the dirt in my brand-new Manolos, you are dumber than I thought. - So take 'em off. - Yeah, I'd like to cram them-- You know what, Mrs. C? You're really starting to worry me. Oh, well, then you're not as dumb as I thought because you should be worried. You should be passing pickles. I'm worried that you're such a pain in the butt that Murray may decide he doesn't want you back. - He'd rather keep the money. - Yeah, well, don't bet on it, Einstein. - My Murray loves me. - God help him. - ( groans ) - So are you sure about that? - About what? - About Murray loving you. - Excuse me? - It's just that he sent me the most beautiful diamond bracelet last week. Now, look, Murray sends diamonds when he's feeling guilty. Now, if he loves you, he's gonna send you flowers. - Has he sent you flowers yet? - Oh, he's sent me flowers. He sent me flowers and he sent me pearls. He sends pearls when he's forgotten to call. He doesn't forget to call me. He will. Oh, you know what? If I didn't have these cuffs on... Oh, really? Well, if I didn't have my cuffs on... - Oh, yeah? - Oh, yeah! Son of a... Ladies. Joey: Hey, what just happened? I don't know. It just went dead. - Come on, George, let's fix it. - I can't. What do I look like, a computer repair man? Oh, marrón. Do you see what I'm seeing? Hmm? Follow that star. What'd you say? Just do it. Okay, I'm here. Oh, my goodness. Oh! Hold on, Murray. ( screams ) What the hell was that?! - Next time, I aim, ladies. - Huh? Now move inside. Let's go! Listen, Marley, you hurt one hair on their heads, I'm gonna break your-- Relax, Murray, no one's been hurt. Now where are you? I'm right next to your piece-of-crap car. Good boy, Murray. Now come on inside. Take a left, your first right, we're in the middle stalls. We tried, Mrs. C. You did great, honey. Please, call me Shirley. That's far enough. Now what, genius? Now we wait. ( both groan ) Season's greetings. 'Kay, uh, put the briefcase down. Put it down! Now move away from it. Come on. All right, all right. All right, I want you to take the handcuffs off. All right. Okay, Stella, I want you to go over to it, I want you to look inside. - Come on. - All right. Give me the key. Give me the key. Nice try. ( groans ) Jake: Is there money in there? It look like a lot of money? I love Christmas. Well done. This money-- this money just bought you Stella. Take a hike. And you're gonna buy me a little time. - Come on, you're coming with me. - Like hell I am. - You're coming with me or else-- - Or else what? Oh. Oh, no. No, no. You shoot me, she doesn't live to see New Year's, Murray. Oh, my God. - Oh, my God! - What, what? What is it? She's going into labor. Murray, help me. - Don't shoot her. - Come here, help her. Come on. Murray, put it down. - Mary: Oh, no! - Ah, the hell with it. - Murray, pick her up. Come on. - Okay. Pick her up. Follow me. In here. Here we go. - It's okay. - Here we go. It'll be okay. - She's gonna be all right. - What do I do? - Yeah, I hope that hurt. - ( Mary groaning ) - Shirley: Breathe, breathe. - Is she all right? Yeah, she's having the baby. - We better get her to a hospital. - No, there's no time. Here, get these off of me. George, come here. Get me out of these things. - Hey, Vince, what do we do? - I don't know. What do you mean you don't know?! You got like 17 kids! Hey, Delores had the kids. I just handed out the cigars. - We better call an ambulance! - It's too late! It's... - ( Mary groaning continues ) - That baby's on its way. All right. Okay, uh... Joey, just lean down here and hold on to her. - Come on. - Go ahead, kid, go ahead. - All right. - Have you ever done this before, Mrs. C? Are you kidding me? She was a nurse when I met her. Remember, honey? You had that really sexy-- Murray, get your mind out of your pants. - Go find a towel or something. - Towel, towel, towel, towel! Towel, towel, towel. ( groaning continues ) Okay, good. Good, good. Sweetheart, you do realize... I know. That kid ain't mine. I know that, honey. Joey: How you doing, Mary? Amateur. Now you're gonna push, sweetheart. You ready? Keep breathing. That's good. You're going to do one, two, three, and then push, okay? - You're doing great. - All right, now, honey, one, two, three, - push! - ( screaming ) We got it! Oh, jeez! - ( baby crying ) - Bingo. - It's a boy. - It's a boy? What are you doing? - Are you okay? - Yeah. Oh, my God. It's a boy. - Joey, look at him. - I am. Joey. Hey, Georgie, you gotta admit, it's a miracle, huh? - You know I love you, don't ya? - Yeah, I know. I'm sorry. I'm such a damn fool. Can you please forgive me? Yes. - But, you know, tonight is gonna cost you. - Oh, I know. - No, I'm talking diamonds. - Of course. - Ooh, maybe a cruise. - A cruise would be nice. What are you doing? Giving the baby a gift. Hey, buddy. Don't worry, it's real gold. Hey, um... this is so he'll always have some spice in his life. You know what you can give him? What's that? - You can give him his name. - Jesus. - Will you look at that? - Wow. It's snowing in the desert. Look, honey. What time is it? It's midnight. Merry Christmas, baby. Merry Christmas, baby. ( music playing )
