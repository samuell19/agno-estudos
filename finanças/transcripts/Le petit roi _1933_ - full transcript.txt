THE LITTLE KING Inhabitants of Grochol, we, Michel I, King of Pannonia by the grace of God and the sovereign will of the people, seeing the troubles that have enflamed our beautiful kingdom and its capital these last few days, declare a state of siege. As a result, let us enjoin everyone to observe the general lights out that will be declared every evening at 9pm. Any person surprised on the streets of Grochol after said curfew is announced is declared a suspect if they lack formal authorisation or urgent cause. Your Eminence... I want... I want to confess. It's very late. I can't wait. Well, come along. Father, some crimes... can be absolved, can't they? There is no forgiveness without repentance. Oh yes there is! The action I'm about to commit is above repentance. I do not understand. I'm going to become a murderer. I'm going to kill the King. And you must give me absolution! No, no, I'm not crazy. Tonight, we drew lots and I was chosen. I will... I must kill the King! Calm down, my son. - In 8 days' time. During the feast of Saint Sventila, I will be there, in the cathedral. And I will strike! I have sworn it before God. Sacrilege. Only God himself can deliver justice. You want me to be detained? Nothing in the world can free the priest from his vow of secrecy. Father, I have to kill. I have to! We're at the end of our tether. We're starving to death. We've been downtrodden for centuries. Our country's history is one massacre after another. Mad kings... Murderous kings. Bloodthirsty brutes. A long line of drunks, that's what's ruled over us. Tell me I'm doing the right thing, that I must commit murder. Give me forgiveness in advance. I will pray to God that he may enlighten and guide you. Inhabitants of Grochol... Take yourselves to bed. The King orders it. Take yourselves to bed. The King is not some dog turd! Take yourselves to bed! One is born a king... like one is born in the gutter. Would you like to be a king? Do you want to be king or not? Not at the cost of a crime. Haven't you had enough of genuflecting? You're Regent. The King's uncle. And you genuflect like a flunky. Remove the king... and you'll be king. There's no point poisoning those chocolates. You know the doctor checks everything they serve him. Don't worry... This time... As God is my witness, I don't want it this way. Idiot. Idiots! You have the nerve to be sleeping? You, you're left behind. Can't you hear the toy soldiers drawing closer? 1, 2, 1, 2... Ah, you chase the sun, but it'll be the same tomorrow as today! 1, 2, 1, 2... You wretches, the regiment is here! You that sleep, rise up! They'll walk all over you. Ah, the drums! You hear the drums? Wake up, or they'll walk right over you! Forward! They're concerned for him. He is well-guarded. Well ensconced behind the fortress walls. Down with the walls! Behind the drawbridges... We'll pull down the drawbridges! Behind the portculluses... Tear down the portculluses! Remove all obstacles! Behind the reinforced doors... Break down the reinforced doors! Here's the palace! Death to the King! Help! What's the matter? Your Majesty called? - Your Majesty is not asleep? Your Majesty was afraid? Afraid? The King is not afraid. No Elias... I was dreaming. Your Majesty must excuse me. My dearest was having a nightmare? Yes, Barbara. My dearest wouldn't like me to stay with him a while? No, Barbara. He knows he has nothing to fear?... - Yes, Barbara. That he is safe in his palace. - Yes. Moreover, everybody loves him. His good uncle, Regent Paul I... - Yes, Barbara. All the people at court. Plus all of his people, loyal and devoted. Yes, Barbara. Sire, time to rise. I dare to hope that Your Majesty is well rested. Thank you, Chamberlain. His Majesty's governess, my respects. Yes, yes, good morning. Come on! Come on! Bad night, was it, my dear? - Yes. Good morning, doctor. That'll do, that'll do. You can stop that, Sire. I wish I could... - It's nothing. Well, pulse normal, a swollen tongue, a touch of fever... 20 grams of castor oil tomorrow morning. Again?! You know, Barbara, I read yesterday in one of the papers that I am God's chosen one. Is this the case? Oh yes. Well, I don't know why He didn't choose someone bigger. The national anthem, Sire. In honour of Your Majesty. Hup! At ease. Gentlemen... The usual, today. Oatmeal porridge, sliced uncooked meat, plain macaroni, mashed prunes. Murderer! Oh no, no, no... today's a truce. His Majesty will dine like every month at His Excellency Regent Paul's, his kindly uncle. That's right. I would therefore like to remind Your Majesty that you must not touch the food served to you at your uncle's. Unless with a wink of the eye... - ... I've approved its consumption. This is to spare Your Majesty... the... Poisonings. Indigestion! Yes, that's what I meant... indigestion. Elias... 8am, service in the chapel. 8.30, History, usual attire. 10am, Council of Ministers. 11am, Geography lesson. 11.30, audience in captain's attire. Midday, depart for the house of His Excellency the Regent dressed as an officer of the guard. Fall out! - Eat up. Unusually today, the President of the Council wishes that the History lesson be given to Your Majesty in the Mausoleum Hall which will make live again, better than the pages of a book, the recollections of the glorious past of our nation. And rat-a-tat, end of all that. Forgive me, Sire. Boleslas the Victorious. He made himself immortal by sacking Rijchen. His tomb. Those of his two beloved wives. So to sum up, all these people are feted because they brought about the deaths of many people. But Sire, military glory... Yes, luckily none of it's true. What's not true? Because these are stories... But Sire, it's History! King Bogus. Your father, Sire. He was a great king. Gifted with Herculean strength he could still fell an ox with his fist the day before he died... Murdered. Yes, Sire. He was a bad man... very unrelenting, wasn't he? But... This is his tomb? - Yes, Sire. But where is the tomb of the queen? Which queen, Sire? My mummy. I don't know... I think... Erm, I think that... You knew her, sir? Yes, Sire. What was she like? But I... don't remember very well, Sire. I remember. I was very small. She spoke to me in a voice that was like sparkling music. I remember she used to run her hand through my hair. It felt soft. I'll ask the President of the Council for clarification. No, don't bother. Continue, if you would. His Excellency Your Majesty's uncle is already 10 minutes' late. All the better, eh? Less time wasted with the Council of Ministers' tedium. Barbara, there's something I wanted to ask you. What's that, my dear? But I think that you won't tell me the truth. Good Lord, ask me anything you like... except for chocolate. Where's my mummy? But... she's dead, my dear. She was buried. She's in Heaven with the angels. Barbara, I'm the king, you're lying to me! What?! You're lying, I've seen. - Saw what? Last year I'd already noticed that my mummy's tomb is not in the mausoleum hall like those of the other queens. Today I had a good look, it's not there. Where is it? In the cemetery probably. Later I'll tell Dr. Jacklow you gave me some chocolate and you'll be out on your ear! - Oh no... Your Majesty wouldn't do that? - I'll do it like this: I swear on the holy books that Barbara made me eat chocolate. Michel, my little Michel, you mustn't. You must believe what I have to say. You're ugly when you cry. Get from here! The Regent is a quarter of an hour late. Sire, it's time for you to go to the council. Come on, my little Michel, come quickly. The king was ready at 10 o'clock, it's 10.15. All the more reason to hurry along. It's 10.15, the king doesn't wait. Sire... we hope that you will kindly excuse our unintentional delay caused, by the way, by the duties you impose on us... Your Majesty's confidence. Come on, gentlemen. He is indeed the worthy son of his brute of a father. He has in his blood all the vices of his ancestors. Yes... The notorious temper of the Kaïnofs. They're having fun, aren't they, colonel? Yes, Sire. You couldn't have told the chauffeur to step on it, I haven't time for viewing? Impossible, Sire! - Why? It wouldn't be prudent. But why? - Because, Sire! Come on, pass, don't stop. Come on, move along. I saw Vitali. Tomorrow he'll bring you the timing mechanism for the bomb. I'd rather have a grenade, they're more reliable. No mistakes with one of those. Vitali could get some for you. - Ask him. Why wait for Saint Sventila? I know a way to get into the palace grounds. The King walks alone there sometimes. Get back! Poor lad... Tell me, Your Majesty has no worries about Sunday? Oh no! Excuse me. What a nice boy. Oh, not all the time. If you were here when he has one of his tantrums... Oh yes, the famous Kaïnof temper. - Exactly. I'm sorry to deprive Your Majesty... However Your Majesty well knows that chocolate is strictly forbidden to him. What do you make of this? Oh, it was bound to happen. I want to tell Michel that I only accepted exile to escape the brutalities of his father and that he might one day make a great king. I agree not to seek him out except to inform him that I'm alive and I love him. To the palace! But Sire, Colonel Kremof... To the palace immediately, I command it! Barbara! You lied to me! I am the king! You're always lying! Where's mummy? But, Michel... You told me she's dead. That isn't true, she's alive. Help! Get out! I am the king! This is my home! Get out! What have I done? You can go. What have I done, Barbara? Yes, I am the king... but I'm still your dearest, eh? Tell me, you're not mad at me? Forgive me. I know my mummy's not dead. I know not to tell. But... - I understand. But then... if she left... she couldn't have loved me. Oh yes, my dear, she loved you very much. Really? Really? But then why? Because of the king, eh? It was my father? He beat her? Eh? Yes. Finally one day, in front of the whole court. So she left. And then they exiled her. Yes, I see. You'll see, Barbara, we'll never mention these things again. I can't take it anymore, colonel. Will these manoeuvres never end? Your Majesty must rejoin the First Company. Who's singing like that? But I don't hear anything. I know that song and that voice. I remember them. It was long ago. Sire, we're returning to the palace. The car is waiting for us. Sound the fall in. What's going on? - We're returning. It must mean revolution in Grochol. - Holy cow! Fall in. My God, what's going to happen? Where did I hear that song? Yes... That was a song your mummy often sang. Do you remember it? Barbara, sing it to me. I'm tired. I want to sleep. Stay here, dear. You'll be safe. I'll go and see what's going on. All this is awful. It's in this morning's newspapers. Last night, very late, the ministry was overthrown. And do you know who they've named President of the Council? - No. That Mr. Storek. That one, who it seems, is everywhere saying he wants the regime's neck. I don't understand very well what he means but he doesn't strike me as trustworthy. He probably means the regime that Doctor Jacklow orders for me. Oatmeal porridge, sliced uncooked meat, plain macaroni, mashed prunes. I don't think so. I ask you... A foul sort like him. He doesn't even wear a shirt. - That's revolting. I mean, it seems like he wants to shake things up at the palace, that he wants to dismiss everyone. Including me perhaps. He can't possibly. - Oh no. They'll not part me from my dearest. You won't let him, will you? - No, I'll tell him. He might not listen to you. - You think so? But... I am the king. His Excellency President Storek is waiting in the council chamber at Your Majesty's pleasure. Well, he's here already, the bad man. We're all doomed. I imagine my visit is not very pleasant for Your Majesty. However I am certain that you will quickly realise that the common good is my only concern. And that my intention is not to separate the cause of the public from the royal cause. I only wish in the meantime to win Your Majesty's esteem and your trust. From time to time, if you want, I can have a chat with you. Eh? I'm sure there are lots of things you know nothing about. Have you ever visited a coal mine? No, sir. Yes... obviously. Obviously. You see, we must have no repeat of yesterday's events. We can't have men shooting at their brothers. There mustn't be women and children being killed. War, Sire... be it civil or between nations, is one of the greatest evils afflicting our poor humanity. Your Majesty will understand one day. Oh, I understand. Sir... May I retain Barbara? Barbara? She's my nurse. She raised me. She's my only friend. But of course, Sire. And now tell me, just between us, did you enjoy attending the Council of Ministers? The duties of my office... - Yes, yes, of course. And from now on, Your Majesty will replace the time spent in the company of those old gentlemen with a nice walk in the grounds. - Thank you, sir! If it's possible... - Of course. And we'll start this morning. All right... I shall return. So... goodbye, Sire. No President of the Council! And no Doctor Jacklow! What are you doing here? Don't you know that it's forbidden to enter the grounds? Ah, but I know you! I've seen you before. They'll soon be making the rounds and if they find you, they'll put you in jail. I'll try to get you out. You're in luck that I'm the king. Really, I am the king. Haven't you seen my profile on the coins? I'm just escorting my comrade. Goodbye. Oh, it's Mr. Storek's overcoat! My dear, your tailor awaits His Majesty for him to try on his new ceremonial robes. The day after tomorrow is Saint Sventila. At last! It's been eight days that my dearest has been unconscious. So I'm better now? - Soon. The President of the Council has a request to make to Your Majesty. May Your Majesty excuse that I'm required to disturb him, but we are forced to make an appeal to him. Well, well... Did Your Majesty get a glimpse, the other day at the cathedral, of the man who threw the bomb? Yes, I saw him. Well, Sire, we believe we've arrested that man. Two gendarmes have brought him here and the examining magistrate would like to show him to you. But His Majesty can't get up! Yes, yes, I can. Mr. Storek is no longer President of the Council? No. While Your Majesty was recovering, he was deposed and Mr. Marski has replaced him. Sire, please raise your hand and swear to tell the truth. I swear. Sire, simply look at this man and consider if you recognise him to be the man who threw the grenade in the direction of Your Majesty. Your Majesty should take his time. Let him weigh the gravity of his testimony. I do not recognise him. Sire... but that's impossible! We found on the accused some... May Your Majesty excuse me, but I wonder if he has understood correctly? I swear this man is not the same one! Now leave me in peace, I've nothing more to say. But we must make an example! Stifle the revolution at its roots! - Of course... Or else we'll have no peace. It's for what time? 5am. Come on, keep your nerve. Section... Halt. Ready... I don't want this! I don't want him killed! I don't want it! I don't want him killed! Aim... Fire! Have you read this? - No, what's that? The health of His Majesty continues to give much cause for concern and in light of the inadequacy of the Royal Physician, Doctor Jacklow and his Pannonian colleagues, we have had to summon from Paris the celebrated Professor Bonnard of the Academy of Medicine. That's nice for myself and my colleagues, isn't it? It's an opposition newspaper. Tell me, is he in there? Who? This Bonnard? Yes, he's in there... with my Pannonian colleagues. Okay, let's see... Heredity... The father? - King Bogus, sir. An iron constitution, a giant. Is he dead? - Yes. Of what? - Assassinated. And the mother? Dead too. Assassinated as well? No syphilitics in the family? Oh no, sir! Well, well... And the child? No serious illnesses? Only some troubles... intermittent ones. Doctor Jacklow is His Majesty's regular physician. His Majesty? And now let's have a proper look. Come over here, young man. Undress. Do you have a good appetite? - Sometimes. What's he been eating? Oatmeal porridge, sliced uncooked meat, plain macaroni, mashed prunes. Yes, yes... Are his bowel movements regular? My God, sir, His Majesty... What? He has constipation? - A little, sir. Well, my fellow! Yes... A towel. You know, before I was unwell I was much bigger. Much? Yes... at least somewhat. - Turn around. Cough. Cough again. Turn around. Deep breaths. Again. What would you say to a short trip? I think I'd catch a cold. It's foggy everywhere. Plus Vodlow is miserable. And Temesnik is freezing. This is why we need to talk about a longer trip. Of a stay in a country where there's sunshine, flowers. By the Mediterranean Sea. You know of it? I remember the Mediterranean Sea. I saw a picture of it once. There was a bright blue sea, with palm trees on the shore and white sails in the distance. And children playing in the sand. Really? And one can play with them? You'd like that? - Oh yes! But my uncle Paul and the Council of Ministers would never allow it. Don't bother about that. Get dressed and go have some fun. That child must leave this country at once. He's a candidate for tuberculosis, cerebral congestion, anemia. So for the moment, no drugs. Good nutrition, fresh air and above all, sunshine. Sunshine? - Yes. It's a medicine you don't have. But we have this in my land. This is good advice, is it not? Yes, of course, kind sir. Your esteemed diagnostic... Perhaps a touch pessimistic... You think so? It seems to me that with certain tonics... Really?! These gentlemen cannot ignore that... - ... reasons of state... Reasons of state?! What's that all about? I'm talking to you about the life of a child. But we don't doubt that... Of a child in the process of being murdered! If I may, professor... You spoke of my pessimism but I find in you a suspicious optimism! You exaggerate. - Perhaps... but I will not be party to this pitiful farce. The vigilant care we have always given to His Majesty... All right, sir! All right! This child leaves this country without delay. Yes, rest assured, dear sir, that we take most serious account of your opinion... But it is not an opinion, gentlemen, it is an order! And I am used to my orders being carried out. This child must be transported immediately to France. To the sunshine. Otherwise... I will appeal to opinion in Europe. Goodbye, lad. You think they'll let me go? - Of course. You have my word. - Thank you, sir. You may come along, gentlemen. Do you think he's right? The bright blue sea... The sunshine... The sails... The sand... Do you think this is a fantasy? Oh no, I don't think so. What name shall I put, madam? Countess Slasko. Tell me... Is it really here that the little king of Pannonia is staying? Incognito, madam. Yes, but it's in all the newspapers. That's what they mean by "incognito". Thanks. Good morning, Sire. Your Majesty must forgive me that he hasn't seen me much recently. However I've been detained by... by some important matters. Where was that? - Erm... In Monte Carlo. But since we've decided to let étiquette slide... We're on a break, Chamberlain. - Thank you, Sire. Are you watching my imp of a granddaughter? Oh pardon me, madam. No need to apologise. Why don't you play with her? - I can't. Why? - It's not allowed. Would you like me to ask your daddy? I don't have a daddy. Well then, your mummy? I don't have a mummy. You're a nice young man. But you know, you mustn't go that way... it's the little king's garden. It doesn't matter because, you see, I am the little king. Forgive me. Grandmother, the flowers. It's so hot. [inaudible] Good morning, young man. Lillie... Leave them. Listen, Sire... Go and play, the both of you. Leave protocol to me. I'll hide. You find me! Okay. 1... 2... 3. Yoo-hoo! Sorry, madam. Sire... Would Your Majesty not allow me a few words with him? I don't have time, madam. Plus I've been instructed not to talk to strangers. The thing is that I knew... I met your mother before she died. And she charged me, in case one day circumstances brought us together with a commission for Your Majesty. Mummy? Tell my little Michel how unhappy his mummy was without him. And give him a big kiss for me. Michel? Run along and don't tell. Never. To anyone. Yes. President, I am happy to pay my respects and to greet you in person, the beautiful nation you represent so worthily and of which I'm honoured to be the host. Well, are you coming? Nothing doing today. Protocol. What's this? What's with that weird costume? Oh, come down! - Okay. Don't go far, dear. The Chamberlain is picking you up in half an hour. Yes, I'll stay in the garden. The President of the Republic is in Nice tomorrow to inaugurate the statue of an old gentleman. It appears therefore to be of utmost importance for Pannonia that I go and greet him at the station with the Chamberlain. Oh no! I thought we were going to play this morning with the street kids in the Old Port like we said. Oh for Pete's sake! Maybe we've got time to go there and set up a meeting for tomorrow? You think we've time? - Oh yes. It's not far, nobody will notice. You're the general?! Give me the costume! Hey over there, listen! Come here! Don't laugh! Try to bomb those morons opposite! Do you understand, you stupid dummy? He called me "stupid dummy"! Oh, the fun I'm having! Michel? Michel! Come on, hurry, hurry! Good heavens! And the presidential train is about to enter the station! Yes, it's coming... - Phew, what a scorcher! It must've been slightly held up. Gentlemen... Thank you. - Gentlemen, here's the train. Ah, here it is! It's on time. Get out of the way, darn it! Can't you see we're rolling! Michel! Ammunition, ammunition! Truce! It's the armistice! 11am! The President of the French Republic... I forgot about him. Pannonia is in the soup! Hang on... Good God, what happened to Your Majesty? Oh nothing, it was war. - War? A mock war. Everyone's been looking for you. The Chamberlain left in despair. Phooey! That's too bad. You can't go back to the hotel like this. What will they all think? Do you know that Your Majesty looks much better than when you arrived 6 months ago. You think so? Doesn't the fact please you? - Oh no! But why's that? Because if I look healthy, Doctor Bonnard will come, he'll say I'm cured and I'll go back to Grochol. You don't like Grochol? It's a prison. Yes. Madam... I'd like to ask you something. It was some time ago... you said you know my mummy ... who's dead. Is my mummy really dead? Ah, there you are! At last! But... Jesus and Mary, what's happened to you? Your Majesty! You know her? It's her? It's my mummy? Mummy... - Yes. My son. Mummy. - Little Michel, I've found you. Be careful nobody sees you. Well, here we have it! Don't worry, young man. You are cured. Completely cured. You don't think that... a short month and a half... or two... two more... You don't think? No, there's no need. Because personally, I've some pretty important business... Business? - In... in Monte Carlo. Mmm... no. You can return tomorrow. Oh right... It only remains for me to pay Your Majesty my respects. So I have to go back? Yes... I know how you feel, lad. I will however advise the government of Pannonia that it will be essential that His Majesty returns here to spend another two or three winters. That wouldn't be too objectionable? Thank you, doctor. I'm cured. - Cured? I depart tomorrow. And you wont be coming back? - Yes... Perhaps... In a year. Listen, I'll write to the government. I'll tell them that every year you must spend some time with me. A nice house full of flowers, full of birds, you'll see. Yes mummy. In a year. My baby... It seems they found 11 bombs in a cellar... in Grochol. Mummy, I don't want to go. I don't want to leave you. Come on, you must be brave. It took a great deal for me to endure all these long years. But it was all for you. So you could become a great king. I don't want to be king. I want to be a child like the others. - No, Michel. You must be king. Soon, you'll understand all the good you can do around you. You'll be very powerful. And from afar I will advise you. Michel! [inaudible] Come, you have to go, my boy. Tomorrow, before leaving, come to my room, I'll be waiting for you. Go. Don't forget now. So, has my dearest remembered everything? I'll see you downstairs in 5 minutes. Okay, hurry along. And say goodbye to her for me. - Yes. Your Majesty is ready. Hurry, we're late. Come along, Sire, we must hurry. Madam, my respects. Goodbye, young lady... Oh, excuse me. Come along, Sire. - Goodbye, Michel. Goodbye, Majesty. Come, come... chop chop! I must advise Your Majesty that because of some serious developments that have taken place in Grochol, Your Majesty will have to leave the train at the Pannonian frontier and continue the journey in a car that will be waiting for him. Sire... Terrible news. Entry to Pannonia has been forbidden to Your Majesty. A republic has been proclaimed, Mr. Storek is appointed president. So, I'm not king anymore? No, Sire. Then no more Grochol! No more Doctor Jacklow! Let's get going! Yes! Chauffeur, to Monte Carlo.
