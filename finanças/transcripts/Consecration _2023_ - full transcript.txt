You know, what is it that you do up here that would make someone like Grace want to kill themselves? -Grace is not dead. -What are you talking about? -She has incredible power and she will use it for evil until she's stopped. [Water lapping] -Cheers. -Cheers. [Indistinct conversations, silverware clinking] You alright? -Yeah. -Sure? Been through a lot. -I'm sure. -How's the, uh, the therapy coming on? -Well, as a survivor of traumatic events both past and fairly recent, the official answer is supposed to be, um, day by day. -[Laughs] -But to be honest, I'm quite shit at therapy. I don't really trust my memory of those times, and, um, healing used to be just forgetting. But I'm realizing that my body actually remembers things that my mind just can't, so I am trying. -Yeah. That's progress. [Both laugh] -Put it this way -- I'm not going to go anywhere near a church anytime soon. -Well, I saw your patient, the old lady who was going blind. -Oh, good. How is she? -Well, she had perfect sight. She only kept the appointment not to be rude. She said it was a miracle. She said you cured her. -[ Chuckles ] Hmm. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ [Horn honks, tires screech] ♪♪ ♪♪ My brother used to believe I had a guardian angel. And I used to believe in nothing.
