[engine starts] You went six cents over. I need the six cents. But I only want ten dollars even. You pumped ten-o-six. Then you should fix your pumps so they don't go so fast. I'm on a fixed income, you know. Lady! If you don't-- [Man] Here. I'll take care of it. Oh. Thank you, young man. It's not that six cents is such a big deal. It's the principle of the thing. My pleasure. She always does that every time she comes in. Otherwise I'd let it go. Takes all kinds. Have a good one. [engine starts] ♪♪ [music on radio] [stations changing] [tires screeching] Aah! Uh, this is it. Lets get it over with. [rings doorbell] Mrs. Furston? Yes? Is something wrong? [sobbing] No, no. No, no. [sobbing continues] [knock at door] Emily? Emily, what's wrong? [sobbing continues] I just need a minute. [Officer] Take your time, ma'am. This can't be happening. He just went to get something from the office. Oh, God. Emily? Oh, my God. What's going on here? [Emily] Oh, God. Oh, my God. What's going on? That's her husband. That's Ed Furston. [baby crying] [coffee brewing] [crying continues] Alex! I need you! [muffled] Okay. Honey, she needs to burp, and you're the only one who can burp her in the morning. I know. Okay, shh. She's fine, she's fine. Yeah, now she's fine. Why hasn't somebody invented a pill for colic yet? [sighs] Look, can't your sister come over for a couple hours? Hon, you really need to sleep. No, I'll be all right. It's okay. [coffee brewing] Oh, my God. Oh, no. Oh, Daddy made a mess. See that? Oh. [Alex] Oh. And so did you. [crying] Honey? Anything? Glove compartment. Hang on. Strange. Mm-mmm. What? [humming] Do you want me to go get you a pillow? [sighs] I didn't get much sleep last night. Oh. The baby... or the wife? The baby. She's got colic. What exactly is colic? [Woman] Excuse me! Excuse me, sir! [Man] Hey! You're a postal inspector, right? [Woman] I'm sorry, Inspector Urbina. I tried to tell him he needs an appointment to see you. That's--that's okay. I'll take care of it. Come on in. How can I help you? I've already been to the cops, and they won't do nothing. So don't try steering me back there. Okay. I wasn't planning-- Postal inspector. So if somebody screws you over in the mail, you do something about it, right? Uh, well, generally, yeah. Well, I'd like you to look into this. I need to know the circumstances of... the situation. [whistles] Okay. So... this is about, uh... receiving unsolicited adult material? What are you talking about, unsolicited? I didn't just solicit this, I paid through the nose for it. I'm not sure I follow. It's like this. I'm looking to get married, okay? But I don't meet a lot of women in my line of work, and so a buddy of mine told me that there's lots of hot-looking women over in Russia looking for husbands. I figured, what the heck, right? What do I got to lose? So I sent away to this mail-order bride company. So far so good. Except they promised me this, and they send me this! Whatever happened to truth in advertising, for crying out loud? 3,000 bucks, hard cash I put down... for this... not this! Uh, sir, I'd have to know what the circumstances are before I can, uh, assist you on-- She don't even speak English! I asked her for a beer and she says... blastny blasny blasny blasny. [speaking Russian] Okay. Good, good. Why don't we get the paperwork started? If you just, uh... just come this way. Frank! Hey. I didn't know you were back. Got in late last night. How was, uh-- how was the vacation? Fine. That's not mine. [chuckles nervously] It was this, uh... this guy, this kind of... chunky guy. He came here, and he was trying... to get a... Are you growing a beard? Oh. Yeah. Well, technically it's a goatee, and...it's already grown. Oh. I see. What do we got? Oh. Well, it's just a matter of what we don't have here. A fellow died in a vehicle last night, and we haven't a clue who he is. No driver's license? Fake. Fake everything. Fake I.D. Fake driver's license. Used a fictitious name to rent the vehicle. They found an unregistered .9mm Glock in the glove compartment. Why was the Inspection Service brought in? Along with the gun, they found some stolen mail, lots of it. Okay. Where do we start? Well, he's in the morgue. We may as well start there. [sighs] Thanks for coming up, Morrison. Two hours from Washington it took. 40 miles, two hours. Bumper-to-bumper. Hey, forget nuclear bombs. Give me three dozen stalled cars, I'll rule the world. Morrison, have you had a chance to look at the John Doe yet? No, they're just wheeling him in now. Well, hurry up, could you? Normal amount of trauma, severe blood loss. Can't see any outward signs of toxicity. And did you find any scars? Just one. On his forehead. Shaped like a telephone pole. Ha! [cracking] [Morrison] Relax, don't be so tense. It's okay. You're in good hands. This isn't gonna hurt a bit. How soon can you get some results? Prints? Uh-huh. I'll put a rush on it. A couple hours. Where to now? Now we've got to tell a very innocent family that their entire world has turned upside down. All right. This is Inspector Barron. She's an expert in identity theft. Nice to meet you. [Man] Is that what happened to us? Yes. May I? Sure. Identity theft. It even sounds horrible. I don't understand how a thing like this could happen. You get pre-approved credit card applications in the mail from time to time, don't you? Time to time? We get one practically every day. What do you do with them? Throw them in the garbage. Shredded or intact? This is your credit report as of 10:00 this morning. You've had a personal finance credit card for five months now. Your balance, as you'll see there, is $8,417. You haven't missed a payment yet. In fact, the issuing bank loves you so much they're about to increase your credit limit. We believe that you've been victimized by the most common from of identity theft. The person goes through your garbage, dumpster diving, or steals the mail directly out of your mailbox. He signs your name to the pre-approved application, indicates change of address, of course, and the card is mailed directly to him. So he gets the card, and he just starts using it? Yeah, that's right. A small-time thief, he might go out and charge a, you know, a fancy stereo system and then throw the card away. But those aren't the people who scare us. Rather than go on a one-time buying binge, a true identity thief will slowly bleed the account dry. Steady, gradual cash advances, always diligent to pay the minimum balance every month, like a good customer. It can go on like this for months, even years with three, four, five or more cards at once, and then when all the money is drained from all the cards, the thief vanishes. What a nightmare. This type of crime, the damage is silent below the surface. You're not gonna have a clue that anything is wrong until it's too late. The fact of the matter is it could be happening to any one of us in this room right now and we wouldn't even know it. Scary stuff. They'll be fine. Bet you they're heading out to buy a paper shredder. Right. His and hers. Mm-hmm. Where to now? 1464 Spring Street, apartment 119. Because? Remember that fake credit card we found in John Doe's wallet? Yeah. Issuing bank says that's where the statements were mailed. See you, guys. Apartment 119. Hmm. At least our John Doe did not spend too much on furniture. Are you the owner? Who's asking? I'm Inspector Hughes, and this is Inspector Urbina. We have reason to believe that the person who rented box 119 was involved in criminal activity, and if it's not too much trouble-- Uh-uh. I don't say nothing till I talk to my lawyer. I know my rights. Hmm. Then we'd like to see Form 1583 that was filed by the person who rented box 419. You got a hearing problem? Is that a no? That's a no. Ah. That okay. Instead, I'll tell you what. I'm gonna go down to the post office and see a copy of Form 1583 that you filed down there. You did file a 1583 at the post office required by law, federal law, didn't you? Come off it. Nobody ever files that shit. You mean you didn't file it? Hell no. [exhales] Inspector Urbina, would you instruct the post office to suspend all deliveries to this address immediately. Right. You have a good afternoon. Hey! Hey, you can't do that! No mail delivery? I'm out of business! Talk to your lawyer. Oh, for Christ's sake! Hold it a second! You win, all right? What do you want me to do, get down on my hands and knees? Jesus! There. Happy? That's all I got. Copier's on the fritz. What does this guy look like? Who remembers? People come and go all the time. Is this him? Yeah, maybe. Hey! Is this him? Yeah. I suppose that could have been him. May we open up box 119, please? There. We'll have a man posted here 24 hours to keep an eye on that box. Why? Some Fed's gonna be sitting around my establishment all day? He'll be discreet. As long as you cooperate, everything will be okay. Yeah. Whatever you say. You just remember, whatever is delivered to that box, you put in that box, okay? What the hell do you take me for? All credit card statements. You and Bridges should start contacting the, um, issuing banks and start tracking down the victims. I know, man. I wonder what'd we'd find if we emptied out all the boxes. One mailbox at a time, Urbina. One mailbox at a time. Thank you very much. I'm done. How about you? I got one more. Yes, is this bank security? This is Inspector Urbina, Postal Inspection Service. I need to report a fraudulent account. Right. The suspect was killed in a car accident last night. Account number is 3442- 2994- 5521- 0062. Yeah, 0062. What? Are you sure? No, no, no! Thank you very much. [Bridges] What--what do you got? What did they say? Frank! Yeah. Our, uh, John Doe in the morgue? He didn't look like somebody who could just get up. go walking around, did he? What are you talking about, Urbina? Well, according to the issuing bank, three hours ago, the guy in the slab waltzed into First Credit Union on Maple, took a cash advance on his card. Looks like our John Doe's got a partner. Come on. Hurry up. [car horn honks] The transaction you're asking about was handled on 11:43 this morning. Who was the teller? That would be Betty Marsh. Would it be okay if we speak to her? Of course. I'll go get her. Thanks. How was Florida? What? Florida? Oh, fine, fine. What'd you catch? We didn't go fishing. What? Frank Hughes went to the Florida Keys, didn't try and snag a single marlin? Nope. What did you do, then? I mean, if I'm not getting too personal. Went bird watching. Really? Really. See, Catherine and I, we take turns picking the vacation spot and activity, and this...was her year. Interesting. [imitates bird call] Hello. Hi. I'm Inspector Hughes, and this is Inspector Urbina. We'd like to ask you a few questions about a customer that you served this morning. A customer? Yeah, at about 11:45 this morning, a man took a $1,200 cash advance using a Passageway bank card. Yes, I remember that. Do you remember what he looked like? No, not really. I mean, I must see at least a hundred people a day. [Frank] About how old was he? Oh, gosh, I'm so bad at this sort of thing. Ballpark figure. 20? 60? More like 30. Is there something wrong? Well, to be honest with you, we really don't think this guy's gonna be retracing his steps, but in case he does, will you please call us right away? What did this man do? We're not quite sure yet, but that's why we'd like to talk to him. Right. Thanks for your-- You're welcome. ... your cooperation. You have video tapes of the surveillance camera? Absolutely. I'll have somebody get them right away. Thank you. Freeze. Hold it. Back up, back up. [groans] Let's give it a rest. I'm already late for meeting Catherine at the restaurant. Oh, yeah? Where are you guys eating tonight? La Dimidia. Ah. That's gotta be nice. Strictly take-out at our place these days. With the baby and all, it's crazy enough without cooking, dirty dishes. Anyway, I'll give this a little longer before I head home. Suit yourself. Come on. Who are you? How are we doing here, sir? Pretty good. I'll take another, and, uh, make it a double. Yes, sir. [beep] [dialing] [Man] Please leave a message. Hey. It's me. Where the fuck are you? It's 7:30. I wait another ten minutes and then I'm gone. Call me later at the regular. Listen, I don't care if you're in a pile of naked cheerleaders. Keep your mind on business. [beep] Hey! Hey. Hi. Sorry I'm late. Forgiven. I got the pictures back from the vacation. Oh, yeah. Mm-hmm Uh-huh. Here, look. You remember that Mangrove cuckoo we saw? Yeah, uh-huh. [dialing] [beeping] And here's the black-whiskered vireo. Mm-hmm. Frank, do you realize how rare it is to see one of these black-whiskered vieros? I may never see another one [laughs] Stop it. [cell phone rings] Hughes here. You asked for a trace on that stolen credit card? Yeah. We show it was just used at the D-Nine bar and grill in Baltimore, Maryland. How long ago? A minute. Do you have a number on that? 555-2121. Thanks for your help. This is important. Mm-hmm. [dialing] [ringing] D-Nine. Hi. This is Inspector Hughes, United States Postal Inspection Service. You just had a customer there that signed a bill with a Passageway credit card? Yeah. Uh, how did you know that? Is the customer still there? Yeah, he's, uh, he's sitting at the bar. What is all this about? All right. This is very important. You try to keep that customer there as long as possible. If he tries to leave, let him. Sure. Is this guy, you know, some kind of criminal or something? You just try to delay him as long as possible. I'll be there in ten minutes. Yeah, okay. I'm sorry. Bye. Bye. Here you are, sir. One more? No. It's on the house. No thanks. I'm done. How about that, uh, Cal Ripken, huh? You know, if it was me, I, uh, I wouldn't have stopped playing like that. I would have kept the streak going. I mean, what's the point in stopping it on purpose? Lou Gehrig. The only reason that he quit is because he got sick... and he died. Uh, you're not, uh, Polish, are you? Not that I know of. So like a Polish joke wouldn't offend you? I'm kind of in a hurry. You'll like this one. It comes free with the drink. There's this really foxy Polish lady, okay? She flies over from Poland, and she checks into this ritzy hotel in New York City. She wants to phone her parents, you know, long distance. She goes to the desk clerk. He's says it's gonna cost $200 for her to phone to Poland. Is there a squad car in the vicinity of the D-Nine Bar and Grill? "$200 to phone long distance to Poland? I don't have that kind of money." And he says, "Don't worry, you know. "Maybe you and me, we can work something out. [cell phone rings] Burger World. Can I take your order, please? [Frank] Urbina, where are you? I'm at the Burger World on Dillion. Why, are you trying to rub it in? Our guy just used his credit card. D-Nine Bar and Grill, and he's sitting there now. Baltimore PD's on the way. Be right there. So--so the desk clerk, he goes up to the room, and he opens the door, and there she is, and she's stark naked. And she says, "Please, please, can I phone my mama now?" He goes, "Yeah, sure. "But first, you gotta come over here, you gotta unzip my pants." [tires screech] So she comes over, she unzips his pants, and he says, "Now you gotta take out my pecker." She takes out his pecker. He says, "Okay, now you can start." She takes his pecker, puts it up to her ear and says, "Hello, Mama? Are you there?" [laughs] Uh, hey, hey! I--I got a better one. [tires screech] [talking, indistinct] I'm Inspector Hughes. We spoke on the phone. Yeah. He took off just a minute ago. What's he wearing? A black jacket, black shirt, black pants. [sirens] You cover both sides of the street. He dressed in black. Damn! You know, I tried everything. I told him a joke. It didn't matter. He just took off. Is that his glass? Yes, sir. I'm gonna have to take it. Sure. Can you describe what this guy looked like? Well, he's just, you know, good-looking guy, normal looking. Uh...he's not Polish. Uh, he did have a kind of a unusual ring, though. Unusual? How? Like, extra big, with a green stone and an emblem on it, you know, like a fraternity ring. [Answering machine] You have three new messages. [beep] [First woman] Call me when you get in. It's important. [beep] [Second woman] I'm so happy just thinking of you. Give me a buzz. [beep] [First woman] Please call me. I really need to talk to you. [Machine] End of messages. Where the hell are you? Box 119. All this in one day, huh? Our guys were in business to do business. No sign of our man, though. These are all credit card statements. Different name. Every one. Hey, listen, I'm about to go down to Washington to the crime lab. Morrison says that the forensic reports are back. I was thinking maybe you should go with me, bring the video from the bank maybe the lab can enhance it. Check for a big green ring. Yeah. Emblem of some kind, you know. It's a long shot, but that's all we got. [coins drop] [dialing] [ringing] [Man] Please leave a message. [beep] [ringing] Is this, uh, Seabreeze, Colorado? [Woman] Yes, it is. I got a little problem with you guys. Uh, a few weeks ago, I got rear-ended by a fellow. He said he was driving one of your cars. The insurance company-- Sir, would you happen to have his name? Ed Furston. Just a moment, sir. Ford Taurus. Uh--uh, sir, unfortunately, that car was in a serious accident, and the occupant was found dead at the scene. I'm sorry. Okay, that's him. See if you can isolate his hand. Which hand? Try both? QD just got this back to us. As you can see, the man who signed the credit card at the bar and the man who signed the transaction form at the bank are the same guy. What about the ballistics on the gun found in the glove compartment? It was fired within the past 30 days, we're pretty certain of that. Does it match any other shootings on file? Not in the Baltimore area. We're doing a wire search now, but it takes time. How about the bar glass? Oh. Yeah, we got plenty of prints, and there's lots of DNA from the saliva on the glass. But the problem is there's no match in the database. So our guy must not have a criminal record. In other words, we're stuck, huh? Not necessarily. You mean you've got something? I mean I have discovered something which I think is very important. What's that? Residue of the scotch the guy was drinking. Scotch? I'm going out on a limb here, and I'm guessing, Delmore, aged 16 years, not 12. When you get the ballistics report, will you let me know, please? Will do. Call the bartender for me. I'm curious about that scotch. Oh, and when Christmas bonus comes around, this would be nice, only lots more of it! Plenty more! Can you back it up about, uh, half a dozen frames? [Man] Sure. [tapping on keyboard] All right. See if you can zoom in on the hand. Maybe, uh-- maybe the ring's on the other hand. Yeah, let's give it a try. There it is. Can you zoom in a little tighter on it? Okay. Let it play through again. Yeah. Oh, my God. Wait a minute. [piano playing] Hey. There you are. Why didn't you call me back? I left you two messages. What's wrong? We're in trouble, Joe. Big trouble. Go forward about, uh, five seconds and let it play from there. [tapping on keyboard] What is it? Frank, take a look at this. Play--play-play it once more. Right there, right there. You see that? Something going on here? Play it back once more. Two men came into the bank yesterday. Cops. And they were asking questions about you. What'd you say? Nothing. [laughs] Well... you did the right thing. You stuck to our plan. We have nothing to be worried about. Yes, we do have to worry. You just watch. My boss is gonna check back and find out that we were there and that you-- Honey, honey-- Hey, hey, hey, take-- Take a deep breath. Just take a deep breath. Excuse me. Could you, uh, give her another one? Everything will be okay, all right? I'm scared, Joe. We could go to jail for this. Thanks very much. Listen-- Look at me, all right? Just look at me and listen. Listen carefully. All these months we've been together, planning this thing, and... we kinda figured out we wanted to be together for the rest of our lives, didn't we? Well, that means something to me. You just gotta hang in there a little while, do you understand? I understand. Okay. All right. Okay, we lucked out. The bank manager's still there. We better get going. He's gonna take a quick look through Betty Marsh's transaction sheets. I'll give you a call on the ballistics as soon as they get back. And don't forget to find out about the Delmore. First thing on my agenda, Morrison. 16-year old, not 12! Scotch. Scotch. Hey. Feel better? Okay now? What about these cops? What did they want? Who are they? I got their cards. Let me see 'em. Postal inspectors. [laughs] What do I have to worry about? No, Joe. These guys looked like they knew what they were doing. Trust me. We're fine. Excuse me. Do you have, uh, Delmore? Can I get a double shot straight up, please? Betty. Let's finish our drinks and then... we'll go home. Okay. [cell phone rings] Inspector Urbina. Yes. Yes, Mr. Hunter. Really? Thank you. Thank you very much. In the past three months, Betty Marsh processed the same card on 25 separate occasions. 25. Each time, she bypassed the standard security check. You call that bank manager quick, right away, before he leaves. Get the address of that teller. She's liable to make a run for it. [giggling] [both laughing] I'll get it. [drops keys] Oh, no! Here we go. There we go. Are you feeling better? I'm sure you're fine. Now don't panic. We're getting too close now. If those cops come back, act dumb. [laughs] You don't know anything about anything. All right. [giggles] [laughs] [giggles] I love you so much. [muffled screaming] [turns off engine] What apartment? 301. Mrs. Marsh, this is Inspector Hughes. [knock on door] Mrs. Marsh, if you're in there, please let us in. Oh, Jesus. Call Homicide. I need to report a homicide. Mr. Cox. Thank you for coming. I'd say it was a pleasure, but under the circumstances... Sit down. You've handled internal security at the bank for how long now? 15 years. How'd this guy get to her? She was vulnerable. This guy probably wined her and dined her, made her believe she'd found true love. I don't know for sure, but I'd be willing to bet he did his homework beforehand. Why do you say that? Before this guy came along, Miss Marsh was seeing a therapist for depression. She lived alone, was in a little financial trouble, apartment full of romance novels. This guy must have seemed like he fell down from heaven. Betty Marsh had no prior criminal record? None. But this guy would have been hard to resist. Champagne dinners and a promise of a life together. I've known people flip-flop over a whole lot less. [sighs] Stakes have gotten higher, Urbina. Maybe she threatened to turn him in. Yeah. Maybe so. Or once that partner of his died in that freak accident, things began to get undone. He may just be tying up loose ends. Oh, no. No, no, no. You--you go first. [groans] [laughs] Damn! I still don't get how you do that. Simple. Technique. Once you get the mechanics together, it's just a matter of repetition. Yeah, technique, repetition. Technique. Muscle memory, Urbina. You can find something that, uh, works, stick with it. Once you do it once... ...you can do it twice. [Alex] Perfect. Nice. That's great. That muscle memory thing of yours is really great. My muscles seem to memorize it a little wrong, but... Let's go. Go where? To the office. The office? Yeah. I concede the game. The check? Let's go! Okay! Now these are all the credit card statements we got from the mail drop box. I want you to go through every transaction, every single one. Let's see if there's any other multiple transactions in any other specific banks. We're looking for threads here. B-17. Bingo. This is the transaction with Betty Marsh, the one that we caught on the security cameras. These other four were processed by a teller named Angela Lohr, First Transnational downtown. No doubt about it. We're dealing with the same guy. This is just the tip of the iceberg. Angela Lohr processed 41 of the transactions that we checked. And she bypassed the standard security controls on every one, just like Betty Marsh. Do you know where this woman lives? Riverview District, about a half hour from here. Good work, Bridges. Thanks. We better get over there. [dialing] [telephone ringing] Mommy, look at this. Mommy's coming right back. Hey. Sounds kinda crazy over there. Ugh! Babysitter's running late. I can't wait to see you. I have something special planned. No, I can't say now. If I did that, it wouldn't be a surprise now, would it? Tell me! Busy. Try again. If it's still busy, we'll get the operator to break in. And see if Baltimore PD's got a squad car in the vicinity. [doorbell rings] Hi. Sorry I'm late. It's okay. Wow. You look really pretty, Mrs. Lohr. Thanks. [ringing] Okay, it's ringing. That looks really good. Hello? [Alex] Angela Lohr, please. Speaking. What seems to be the problem, Officer? Prom Night. Just spot-checking for drunken teenagers. Did you think I was a teenager? From 50 feet back it's hard to tell. [laughs] You made my night. Okay. I don't know what you're talking about. 41 separate transactions, all improperly processed, all from the same man, all with different names. Come on, Angela. We know you're involved. I still don't know-- Hold on. You need to listen to what I'm saying. This man is very dangerous. You could be in-- She hung up. [telephone rings] Stop calling me or-- He murdered a bank taller last night. Her name was Betty Marsh. She was suffocated in her own bed. You're lying. Joe wouldn't do that? Joe? See? You don't even know who he is. Hold on. Does Joe wear a big green ring? Does Joe wear a hat when he comes into the bank? Think about it, Angela. Has Joe ever once left anything around that could identify him? Has Joe ever once showed you where he lives? Can I help you? Mm-hmm. [beep] Uh-huh. Where do I turn? [tires screech] Oh, my God. [dog barks] [doorbell rings] [doorbell rings] [knocks on door] [doorbell rings] [sighs] [knocks on door] Hey, Angela? Hey, honey. [knocks on door] Angela. Hey, it's me. [telephone rings] [gasps] [ring] [telephone rings] [ring] Stay here. I'm calling 911. [shakes doorknob] [telephone rings] [gasps] Who is it? [Man] Hello. Mrs. Lohr? My name is Jerry Ogen, and I'm calling with a special, one-time only subscription offer from the News Herald. [click] [dog barks outside] [gasps] [Angela crying] And you don't have one single photograph of him. No. What about a car? What kind of car does he drive? A Chevy. A green Chevy. Rented? I don't know. [door closes] Excuse me. Have you seen these before. No. [sighs] Listen, Angela, we're gonna have to put you and your boy in protective custody tonight just in case Joe decides to come back. Am I going to jail? We're really not concerned with that right now. What we're concerned with is finding this guy. Why don't you take a few minutes, gather some of your belongings, okay? Come on, let's go. [Alex] So the flowers were definitely charged on this card. Okay, thank you. Well? Bank confirms it. Credit card issued to Francis X. McGinty, address 605 Kenwood, apartment 335. I'll send the men over there, but, uh... that's another drop box, I'll bet on it. Yeah. The bank's gonna fax us over a new credit card statement. Apparently, it's a pretty active card. Department stores, gas stations, that kinda thing. Why, all of a sudden, is he using this particular card for purchases? All the other cards he used for cash advances. All of them. Well, maybe this is really him. Maybe McGinty, Francis X., is his real identity. You're calling people at 7:00 on a Sunday morning. Somebody ought to arrest you. Hey, baby, look at this. This is the complete transaction of Francis X. McGinty. All five month's worth, you know? I think I'll stick with the arts and leisure section instead. Gas stations, gift shops, but there's something here I don't quite understand. Which one? Right there. Renewal. Oh, that's a electronic debit. Banks automatically charge your card when you have to renew something. I know. Like what? I don't know. Why don't you call them? Can't you schedule your hunches Monday through Friday? You must be Inspector Hughes. Yes. I'm Cheryl. We spoke on the phone. I appreciate you coming here on a Sunday morning like this. Here's the federal search warrant. No problem. The locksmith will be here in a minute All right. All right. [Alex] Exactly what is this hunch? [Frank] This was the only card used for outright purchases, the only card sent to a different drop box. So you mean Francis McGinty is his real name? Maybe it is, maybe it isn't. Not important. The important thing is he thinks it's clean. [Cheryl] The safe deposit boxes are down this way. No surveillance cameras. No, only motion detectors. Uh... Oh, here we go. Box 2444. [Frank] Okay, let's do it. [Cheryl] My God. How much you think is in there? At least a million dollars. What shall we do with it? We'll keep it right here. What? I want that box fixed and reinstalled so it looks like nothing has been tampered with. You take this out and flip through the money. Give us a rough idea of what we're talking about here. You're not gonna confiscate the money? No, no, the money is gonna stay right here. I'm much more interested in confiscating the man who put it here. [Alex] Okay, here's our timeline, people. On Friday, he killed his first teller. Saturday, he tried to kill the second teller. He knows we're close, but he has no reason to suspect we're aware of the safe deposit box. When the bank opens for business today, that'll be his first chance to get in there and grab the money. Now, you've all been on stakeouts before. There's no need to go over the obvious. Basically it's this. Griffo, Turner, Mahulco and I will be posing as bank customers. We need to rotate every 45 minutes. Bridges will be working a desk. Doing what? Bank auditor. There's your name tag. Great. Now, I'm gonna be on the floor posing as a bank guard. Everybody, this is Mr. Yamura. He's a bank employee who normally takes care of the safe deposit box area. Shouldn't we have an inspector back there? No. It's important that we create the impression of a normally functioning bank. Mr. Yamura will be carrying this silent alarm. If our guy comes in, tries to access box 2444, he'll activate, and we move in. What about surveillance cameras? No. There's some right-to-privacy issues with the bank and its customers. The area is set up with motion detectors interfaced with this computer. Hank will be taking notes on any movement. Now, gentlemen, lady, our man is considered armed and dangerous. So please, be safe and be smart. [Man] Good morning. Thank you. Good morning. Sign in for me, please. [buzzer] Good morning, sir. Morning. Box, uh, 2328, please. Yes. Excuse me, sir. Where do I go for traveler's checks? I'm sure any teller will help you, ma'am. Where--where's Gus? [Frank] Excuse me? Gus, the usual guard? Oh, he's on vacation. Vacation? Hell, I want Gus' job. He just had a vacation last month. You know, if being a bank auditor is not the dullest job in the world, I will tell you what is. Pretending to be a bank auditor. What's tomorrow's schedule? We start at 9, open at 10. And another thing. You know what the problem with a stakeout is? Your day job does not know that you are on a stakeout. I'll see you at the bank tomorrow. Relax, honey. You have to figure it's a long shot. I know, but... I got a hunch. Inspector Hughes, I now you're famous for your hunches, but think about it. Why would this man risk coming back to get his money if he knows you're onto him. I mean, if I were this guy, I'd just mosey on down to the next town, make another mill where nobody knows me. Yeah, but, uh... he's been taking his money out a thousand at a time for months. There's no risk, at least not in his head. Why would he think we'd know anything about his safe deposit box? I know he thinks we're onto his scam with the tellers, but, uh... he's gonna come and get his money, I'm sure of it. This is Daddy getting ready to go to work. This is Daddy running a little late. This is Daddy changing a tire. Oh, Daddy's got a boo-boo. Poor Daddy. Alex is late. Yeah, I know. Morning. Morning. Identification, mister? There you go. Hold on. Can I see the name again, please? Yes. It's Urbina. Inspector Alex Urbina. I'm kinda running late. Is there a problem? Step this way a minute, please, sir. Why? What-- Just over here, please. What's the problem? You're Inspector Alex Urbina? Alex Urbina. Urbina. You mind explaining to me how you managed to pass through security ten minutes ago? What? It's all over, Mr. Yamura. I think we got our guy. You did? Picked him up right outside the bank entrance, and he had this key on his person. Now, if that fits the box in there, then I think we got our man. Look, I will stay here. Get Frank Hughes. Get any if the inspectors. They can identify me. Let's check. Right. Anyone else try to access the box recently? Uh, no, sir. Wanna make sure we're not dealing with any kind of accomplices. If this key fits, we've got our man. [laughs] What do you know? Well, well. Number four. Four plus four... Eight. Urbina's still not here yet. Babies. Yeah. So how's things going here? Oh, steady as she goes. There's been a couple people in and out, but nothing but dead air on the motion detector now, though. Hey, wait a minute. What did you say about that motion detector? I said it's all quiet. Yamura's back there. It's not supposed to be all quiet. We got Yamura down He needs assistance. Seal down the perimeter and the plaza. What happened? He got in as me ,Frank. This time he stole my identity. Double check. Seal all those front doors. You guard the front. I'll go here. Hey! Hey, did you see anybody rush out of here? No. I mean, just the usual people. All right, seal these doors. Nobody goes in. Nobody goes out. Seal the stairs. What's up there? Insurance company, travel agency, I don't know what else. How many floors? 33 above in the tower and three below in the garage. Seal the garage. Nobody in or out! It's all clear. No one suspicious was seen leaving the plaza. Hey! Hey! Get those elevators down. What? Bring those elevators down now! Third elevator. It's on the 16th floor. 15, 14, 13... 3...2...1. [elevator dings] First elevator. [elevator dings] What? It's stopped on 4. What? Fourth elevator! It's not coming down! Okay, now it's coming! 3, 3, 1. [elevator dings] Damn! [talking, indistinct] Frank? I got our man. North Main on 59th. Frank, I think he turned down an alley off Barton. He might be doubling back. Hey. Drop your gun. Kick it over. Look, just go easy. Oh, I'll go like I'm gonna go. All I want is some cooperation. Sure. Come here. Freeze! No closer, Hughes! Put the gun down. I don't think that's gonna happen. You may as well. I took all the bullets out of the gun last Sunday when I opened up your safety deposit box. I kinda figured on that. So I brought along an extra clip in case I used up what was already in the gun. You may as well put the gun down. You're not gonna get out of this alley. Oh, I think I might. You ain't gonna make Lauren a widow. Ain't that right, Dad? [coughs] I ain't bluffing, you son of a bitch. Get out of here. You brought extra bullets, did you? [cocks gun] You bring an extra firing pin? [Alex] No! [click] [cocks gun] [click] [click] [click] [click] [click] Okay, that should do it. [door buzzer] It should work. [door closes] Guess who's here? Hey! What are you doing? Brought you a little home-cooked meal. It's his five-alarm chili. Beware. Oh, yeah? Boy, you guys are heaven-sent. Does this make any sense to you? [baby cries] Ah, excuse me. They're playing my song. Alex, will you take care of this, please? [Catherine] Can I go see her? [Lauren] Oh, yeah. I didn't know you cooked. I don't. But I do make a mean chili from time to time. Oh, yeah? How mean? Oh, well, I tuned it down a bit. This is the tuned-down version? [laughs] Whoo! Mmm! Oh, thanks. Would you mind if I keep at this? Not at all. You see, this guy here is supposed to go up, but it's broken. [telephone rings] I'm just gonna return it. [ring] Inspector Urbina here. Voilá. Look who we got here? Catherine has got the touch. You mind if I hold her a a second? Oh, no, by all means. If she minds, she'll let you know. Come on. Come on. I'm gonna take two minutes and change the bedding in the crib. I'll help you. Yeah. [laughs] [humming] Well, I just-- I just spoke to Joe or Francis or... whatever our guy's name is. We've gotta go down to the station in the morning. Yeah? I didn't know you took the bullets out of that gun on Sunday. I mean, of course, you would. It's--it's logical, but... Still, for a minute-- She on solid food yet? She--What? Is she on solid food yet? No. Oh! Taking the firing pin out, though. That was even better. She's really cute, man. Of course, for my own piece of mind, you could have told Joe both things at once. "Hey, don't bother shooting my friend Alex here. "There's no bullets in that gun. There's no firing pin either." That would have been nice. I will next time. I'm sorry. Next time? [humming] Oohhh! The thing is, what if it was a new gun entirely? How did you know? How did you know that the gun in his hand was the same gun you disabled in the box? Oh, it was just a hunch, you know? One of those Monday to Friday hunches. There's your daddy. See? A hunch. Say "Hi, Dad." [sighs] Oh, God. See him? [laughs] I marked the barrel of the gun with a piece of chalk so I'd know it was the same gun. Aarrgghh! Aarrgghh! You weren't scared, were you? Scared? No, I don't-- I don't get scared. [gibberish noises] Um... Oh, no. Oh, no. Here you go, sweetheart. That was nice. Well, you know what they say about payback. Here. You might wanna-- You got something on your shirt. Look what Daddy made. Who do we got here? Your guess is as good as mine. Christ almighty. How many aliases does this guy have? What's his real name? Nobody's got a clue. Get out of here. Truth. It could be Jimmy Hoffa we got in there. This guy could be anybody, anybody at all. Closed-Captioned By J.R. Media Services, Inc. Burbank, CA
