The three of us were born and raised by the same parents. But we couldn't be more different. Prior to three days ago we hadn't been in the same room since mom passed. Before that, my wedding 10 years ago. Although brothers, we have completely different perspectives on our upbringing, life, love and family. We came up here to say goodbye. As it turns out, my brothers met a man they never knew and I only knew for a short while. But after this weekend, all of our lives will never be the same because of him. The Lord works in mysterious ways indeed. (bright music) (quacking) - You know the timing of these things is never good. You're just gonna have to go for it. - Well the old man sure went for it plenty of times after he was baptized, but, nothing. I went for it at the funeral, but, just not receptive to anything. - How about Rob? - I just hope Rob makes it out there. I tried to pin him down. Offered to pick him up, drive him up there but no he wouldn't go for it. - You really think he would flake on something like this? - He sure wasn't at the funeral long and wouldn't show up when dad tried to get us to his house so we could divvy up his stuff. So I don't know. (waves crashing) - [Boy] Come on dad! (calm music) - He's full of so much anger, they both are. It's nothing the Lord can't handle if they'll let him. - [Mike] Yeah I sure got my work cut out for me. - Stop making it about you. It's not about you and you having to change their hearts. You can't do that, it's not your job. Your job is to share the truth with them, cover them in prayer and sit back and let the Lord do his thing. Have faith, they'll see what your dad had in the last few months of his life. What he found, and his relationship with the Lord and how much peace that brought him, peace he never had before. It'll work out. Just believe it. - How much do I owe you for this session, doc? - (chuckling) This one's pro bono. But don't ask me again, I can't keep helping you like this. - Well thank you. - So what are you gonna do while I'm gone? - I'm gonna have lunch with Tina tomorrow. - Hey how are you taking her? - That's a good question, not sure. We're supposed to text, thanks for the reminder. - Two? Just a second. - So what time are you leaving? - Soon as I wake up. - I guess we'll say goodbye tonight? - You could always stay over. - You know I can't do that. - Right this way. (gentle music) - Just seems like every time I see him now he's preaching to me. And we go 30 years with things being one way, all of a sudden they're totally different. I mean, they weren't the greatest guys before but at least they're either my dad or my brother. - So who are they now? Maybe you should give them a chance. - Yeah, you're probably right. - [Becka] Give them a chance. - You're sweet, thank you. What are you gonna order? - I don't know yet. (gentle music) (bird squawking) (sizzling) Just go into it with an open mind. - You know what I found? If I keep an open mind, he shows me the way. You know who to be and what to do. How are those taquitos, good? Thanks so much guys, this has been fun. Have a great night, okay? I really appreciate it. Travel safe up there. - [Becka] Do you know him? - No. - How did he know about your trip? Was he listening to us? - That was really weird. (crowd chattering) (clicking) (creaking) (belt clinking) - I'm gonna miss you. - I'll miss you too. - That wasn't very convincing. - Have a nice weekend. - You too. Good luck up there. - I'm gonna need it. Bye. (light music) (waves crashing) (upbeat music) - [Narrator] When you're going camping, be sure to make a checklist. If you don't, you're gonna forget something. - [Mike] Boy, I'm gonna miss you guys. - We're gonna miss you. - I'm gonna miss you too. - You have a great weekend, okay? - We will. You have everything you need? - Yeah, I don't need much. When you use my stuff, you know Dylan. - Yeah. - He'll take care of it. - All right, well I love you. - Love you. - And just be safe. - I will, love you. - Love you too. - [Mike] You gonna be a good girl for your mom? - Yes. - [Mike] Promise? - Yes. - I love you. - Love you. (gentle music) - "Come follow me," Jesus said. "And I will make you fishers of men." All right, bye you guys, I love you. - Love you, bye. - [Mike] I'll see you in a couple days. - Love you too. Drive carefully. - I will. I'll see you in a couple days. - Call Rob. - [Phone] Calling Bob. - Not Bob, Rob. - [Phone] Calling Rob. (phone ringing) - Oh darn. Yo. - Hey, you're there. - Yeah. - You on your way? - Oh yeah, dude that's the thing. I don't think I'll be able to make it there in time. I just don't. - Listen, no, hey. Nothing's more important than this. This is for dad, right? - I know. I really wanna be there but just a lot of things have been coming up for me. - Rob, I swear if you don't make it I will never speak to you again. I'll never give you another dollar and I will not listen to your BS stories anymore, you got me? - Dude, I don't know what you're so upset about. - Hey, don't dude me, number one. Number two, this is dad's dying wish so you better be there, you got it? - [Rob] Fine, soon as I can. - Yeah, fine, I'll see you there. Yeah. (light music) (phone ringing) (splashing) - [Rob] Hey this is Rob, I'd love to chat but when you come to the southwest, you know how it goes. Later. - [Mike] Hey, what's up, buddy? We're on our way up but the phones don't work up there and I just wanted to make sure you know where to go. So we're gonna be at the Limerick Camp Grounds site number seven. You don't need anything. Dylan said he's got a tent set up for you. All you need is your sleeping bag and whatever stuff you need personally. But hoping we really all do make it up there buddy, drive safely, and hope to see you up there. Take care, see ya, bye. (light somber music) - Hey Rob. Hey. It's okay, I just wanna talk. (somber piano music) (light music) - Hi, how are you doing? - Good, how are you? Nice bear. - [Shop Owner] He was taken in 1960 up in South Lake, about 25 minutes from here. - Wow. - Can I help you with something in particular? - Yeah I need some flies. - [Shop Owner] Your tire? - No. - [Shop Owner] Why don't we step back to the flies that are all ready made? - Sounds good. - You gonna be fishing lakes or streams? - Streams. (light music) (ignition firing) (light music) - [Dylan] Hey Mikey, how you looking? - Hey buddy, I'm on my way, got out a little late. I'm about an hour to Lone Pine so I'm thinking probably three or four. - Four? When did noon turn into four? - Sorry man, I told you. Traffic was nuts in L.A. I got out a little late. - Yeah right. All right, well you just drive safe. And I'm headed up the hill right now so I'm gonna lose cell reception, all right? - I'll see you when I get up there. All right, see you up there later. - [Dylan] Right, right. - Rob, what's going on, man? You need a jump? - Nah, I'm gonna need a lot more than a jump. Thanks, though. - Ah, no worries man, what's going on? Need a lift, need me to drop you off somewhere? - [Rob] I'm going pretty far away. - So where you going? - To the mountains. - Mountains? Where you off to? It's crazy, he's going to the mountains too. - Supposed to be going to Mammoth. - Mammoth? - [Woman] No way. - Seriously, you're going to Mammoth. - Really? - Yeah. - What are the chances of that, babe? Right, he's going to Mammoth, we're going to Mammoth. - [Woman] We should take him with us. - 10 minutes away. We're going to Red's Meadow, man, hop on in, we'll give you a ride. - Mammoth, really? - Seriously, hop on in. (light music) - Come on. For me? I don't know why you won't do it for me. I love you and I wanna marry you. - What does one have to do with the other? - [Narrator] When you're going camping, the site is very important. Don't take the first one. Check them out. How far is it from the river? Can you hear the river? What about the restrooms? Are they nearby? Firewood, you gotta think about that, you have to have fires. What about the neighbors? Do they have a dog, do they have a baby? A baby can ruin your trip. Look, the campsite can make the difference between a so-so trip and a great trip. After you find the right site, get set up. Get organized, then you can relax and enjoy yourself. - [Man] How you doing? - [Dylan] You must be the campsite host. - That's me. Welcome to my paradise. Dylan, what's the last name? - McKay. - M-C-K-A-Y? - Yeah. - Okay, great. Where you from? - Ventura county. - Ventura county, whereabouts? - Thousand Oaks. - Thousand Oaks, no kidding. Got a sister in law in Camarillo. - Ah, the outlet mall. - The outlet mall. If you need anything, I'm on the last trailer on the left hand side as you're coming in. And bathroom's on the right hand side. Make sure you use the bear cabinet with all your food. If you don't you'll have some uninvited guest. - Right. - And you don't want that. How many nights you staying? - Uh, two. - Two, 22 bucks. And are you gonna do fishing while you're up? - Yeah, we just fly fish. - Really? - Got any good spots? - Got a great spot for you. - What'd you got? - You go up the creek about 150 yards, and it breaks off into a Y. Take the right hand side. - What happens if I go left? - You'll just be sitting in water, there's nothing there. - Okay. - All the fish are on the right. - All right. - Enjoy yourself. - Sounds good. Well, can I do that? - Yeah this is yours, here you go. - After I got us set up, I had to find what we came up here to do. I had to find a place to spread the ashes of my dead father. (water gushing) Once I found the spot, it was very clear. This is the end of the trail. Nice of you to show up. - Hey you know I wouldn't miss it. - Good to see you. - Good to see you. - How are you man, how was your drive? - Good, good, how was yours? - Not bad, little traffic out of L.A. - It's to be expected. - It happens, so. You talk to Rob? - Yeah I talked to him around noon when I woke him up. - Man, well. I think he'll be here. - Wanna bet? - Have a little faith. - If you say so. - Have a little faith. - Okay. Come on. - Hey. Look what I brought. - Where'd you get that? - One of the boxes from dad's house. What do you think, how do you like it? - [Dylan] Looks like it fits like a dream. - It does, it fits perfect. Do I look like him? - [Dylan] Yeah. (clanging) - What are you doing over there? - What's it look like I'm doing? - Struggling. - Hmm, very good observation, Mike. - You need some help? You need me to step over there and show you how to swing? - [Dylan] Evidently. - All right. - [Dylan] Oh, I got it. (rock music) ♪ And we will shake ♪ ♪ Shaking happens when I pray ♪ ♪ Yeah yeah yeah ♪ ♪ Come every land and every nation ♪ - So when I was in high school, Jim, he was my youth pastor. Man, he had a way of really getting us in the bible. He used to play this game with us all the time, it was called bible crap shoot. You close your eyes, open up the bible. Any verse, any page you pointed too, it just, it had relevance. Any time we had a problem, any time we went to him for advice or anything, it's the only response, is to roll the dice. That was all we needed, that was enough. (light music) - [Narrator] When you're going fishing, it's like a battle. Being prepared is essential. You can't land a lunker if you forgot your net. You can't pull the hook if you don't have your needle nose. - [Mike] Seeing Dylan up here immediately takes me back. It's like we're eight years old again. I can hear the old man telling us what to do. Grab that, move this. Hey, over here. He felt the need to tell us what to do all the way to the end. But in the end, I wish Dylan would have been listening. (mumbling) - Haha I think so too. He never met a tool he didn't like (mumbling) - [Dylan] That's out. - Now this is not a bad drill. - [Dylan] It's not bad. How's the battery on that? - This works, but the charge stays a long time. - 'Cause I don't need to get me some stuff that batteries that's used that you're gonna need. - You know what Mike could use offhand? - Oh wow. - [Dad] I've chosen things for each of you specifically. But there's plenty left that you both could use so split it up however you'd like. - Oh, my Lafours hat. Oh thanks. Lafours gave you this one. I didn't want to hear him tell me he's tired. (mumbling) Get out of here. (light music) It says cookbook, great study bible here. - Dylan, what the hell, man? What's the matter with you? You need to grow up. - You two are what's wrong with me. Give me that book? - Thanks, Pop. - Yeah. - He doesn't know what he needs. (gentle music) - When the campsite host spot failed us, we decided to try some of the old trusty holes. But after getting skunked at every hole we ever had success at, we decided to head back to the site. You have to know when to be stubborn and stay out there and you have to know when to call it a night. - [Driver] You know, if you're bored, there should be a bible back there somewhere. Why don't you give it a shot? - All right, might as well try out this bible crap shoot. All scriptures God breathed and useful for teaching. Rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness. Pff, what a load of bull. Still, it's a pretty strange coincidence. - You know Rob, it's gonna be real late by the time we get in. Why don't you just stay with us for the night and you can meet up with your brothers tomorrow. (fire crackling) (gentle music) (light guitar music) - [Mike] Well done for me, buddy. You know I like mine basically burnt to a crisp. - So I found a spot. - Huh? - Dad's spot. - Cool. Where? - Right up the river. Been thinking a lot about it, Mike. Just think what he's been up to. - Yeah. - So what's up with you and Eva? - Oh we're good. Everybody's good, thanks. What about you, Becka, work? - Becka's good. Work sucks but Becka's good. - Yeah, work always sucks. - She's fine. I like her a lot, you know. - Yeah I hope so. - I think I'm gonna ask her to marry me. - Oh yeah? That's cool. Yeah, didn't you get a ring or something? - Yeah. - Oh yeah, let me see. - Check that out. - Cool. Must have cost a pretty penny. - Guess what the best part is. - What's that? - Guess who I got it from? - Who? - Richard Eaton. - Eaton? Eat dog from high school? - Yeah the Eat Dog. - What's that guy doing, man? Like I could put him away. - Slinging carats, man, slinging carats. - The three C's, huh, he's selling ya. - He is. - That guy. He used to drive dad nuts. - Oh man, he used to wear dad out. (zipping) All right there, reading rainbow. I say we get up early. - Hold on, hold on. - Wish I would have known I was coming up to Jesus camp-- - Hold on a second, D. - You're really starting to annoy me with all this bible stuff. - I'm sure not trying to annoy you, D. - Well you are. I guess I'm just having a hard time getting my whole head around someone with so many demons could just all of a sudden wake up one morning and (snapping) be a totally different person. - Yeah, it's called the Holy Spirit. As soon as it's upon you, you're never the same, your life has changed forever. - Whole bunch of baggage, my friend. A lot of demons. - Once he finally had a relationship with Jesus, he had a peace that he could never have had before. You saw it with your own eyes. I don't know why you doubt. He wasn't the same, you know it. - I guess you're right. By the end he couldn't even go to the bathroom by himself but he sure did it with a smile on his face. - Once he found the Lord, he had a peace that he could never have had before. D, there's signs everywhere. You just have to open your eyes and see them. - If you want to live in this fantasy land, be my guest. But you're on your own. - Hmm. No I'm not. (crickets chirping) (solemn airy music) (zipping) You made it. - It wasn't easy, trust me. - [Dylan] You'll get your medal when we get some more sleep. - It's good seeing you too, Dylan. - [Dylan] I got a tent set up for you there, the blue one. Air mattress and sleeping bag, everything you need. - I'm gonna knock out then. (gentle music) - BB gun, you remember that? I wanted to kill him. - So what's the haps on the craps? - [Dylan] He's an idiot. - What? - What's for food, what do we eat? - There's a box of powdered donuts over there. - Plenty of them. - What was that? That's what I thought. - I came a long way for some powdered donuts. - Rob, leave it alone man, give me a break. - Why don't you just have one then? - Dad would be so proud, good job. - [Dylan] Five minutes, you're already complaining. - All right, all right. - Why don't you shut your mouth, you control freak burnout? - Guys, guys, guys, you know what we're up here for. What's the matter with you? - Suck it. - Powdered donuts, who wants powdered donuts? - So soon as I walk into the arena, these two people that work for the team, they see me, they look at me and they walk right up to me. In fact they point. Soon as they get there, she says how would you like to take the half court shot? - You guys wanna do this? - Hey, we're gonna do it later, Rob. - What, you just got here, just do this? Give me a break. - Besides, we're gonna do it at sunset. And we need to get some wood. D and I could use your help. Did you bring your gloves? - Of course not. - You guys should just go without me. - Rob, we could really use your help. - I could do something here. - We could really use the extra hand. Come on. It's not about Dylan and I. This thing's about all of us and dad. Come on. - Why don't you guys just-- - Hey, why don't you just get in the car? - [Mike] You think you were being a little hard on him over there? - [Dylan] No I don't. This is like babysitting and not getting paid. - [Mike] Yeah so what's different than the last 30 years? - [Dylan] Nothing, that's the problem. - Why don't you take it easy on him and give him a break? - Kid's got problems, Mike. - [Mike] I know, he didn't have the same deal we did and you gotta give him a hard time. - [Dylan] You take care of him. - Yeah, I've always taken care of him 'cause you've always ignored him. (light music) All right I'm gonna get us some kindling. Over there looks like some good firewood. Make sure you get us some big chunks. And also make sure you're looking for something with some sap on it. That'll help get the fire started. - [Dylan] You got it. - Nice shot. - [Dylan] Yeah, did you like that? - I did. That was nice. All right, I'm gonna take this kindling back to the campsite. Why don't you pick up the rest of that wood. Rob, help him out. I'll see you guys back at the site. - [Dylan] Sounds good, see you in a bit. - If I drop any kindling, pick it up too. - Hey, let's go. The wood's not gonna pick up itself. Hey, Rob, come on. I need your help. This wood isn't gonna walk itself back to the campground, you know what I mean? Let's go. - You think you're a big shot all the time. But guess what. You sucked as an older brother, dad sucked as dad. You and Mike have all this great amazing stories about him but guess what, they're all BS. Here's the truth. He abused me, he abused mom. Dad was a creep! (bashing) - What's wrong with you?! - You better talk to him! - Screw this, I'm gone! - You better talk to him. - That's your brother man, give me a break. - Give me a break? - You're punching your little brother? He's got issues, okay? - I'm tired of this! - No kidding, so why are you punching him? - All the time. Nothing changes. Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year, you name it, St. Patrick's day. Any holiday out there, he always screws it up! - Oh yeah, just give him a break. Give him a break. - Why did you even invite him? - 'Cause he's our brother. - You have no idea what he said about our dad. That's it, go walk away. Go take care of him, go make him lunch. (somber music) - Having Rob over 10 years younger than both of us made it extremely difficult to relate to each other. Rob and I always got along okay but Dylan and Rob have clashed since the word go. It's no surprise that they got into it up here. But where we go from here, only the Lord knows. Keep you head in all situations. Endure hardship. Do the work of an evangelist. Discharge all the duties of your ministry. For I am already being poured out like a drink offering and the time has come for my departure. I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. Now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness which the Lord, the righteous judge will award me on that day. And not only to me but also to all that have longed for his appearing. Hey Rob. We're about to hit the water, you wanna roll with us? You sure? - Ready to rock and roll? - [Mike] Yeah I am, he don't wanna go though. - Shocker. - Typical. - Mhmm. - [Mike] Well let's go, you show me and then we'll get in the water. - All right, sounds good. (light music) (gushing) - I've been thinking about that dream you had. - Yeah? - Do you remember the last thing that dad wrote on the whiteboard at the hospital? - Yeah, Tim four seven. By the end he was writing it on everything. - Actually it's 2 Tim 4:7. Dad's favorite bible verse. - [Dylan] Well what's it about? - Well it's written by Paul and he's writing to his protege Tim. And he's telling him basically to keep up the good fight. He says I fought I've fought a good fight. I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. - Yeah, sounds like him. - Yeah, it really reminded dad of the end of the trail statue. - Dad was a warrior up until the end too. - Yeah, just like the Indian on the horse. Seeing it to the end. - [Dylan] I need to talk to Rob. - [Mike] Yeah I think you're right. We both do. - [Dylan] I think I'm gonna take him to dad's Chumash spot. - Oh yeah, that's a good idea. I should roll with you guys. - Eh, I think it should just be me and him. Be careful, this is the spot. Check this out. I'm really sorry I hit you today. I shouldn't have done that. When you called dad a creep, it really pissed me off. I'm really sorry you had the dad who came back from the war who was all messed up. See Mike and I, we had a different dad. He would take us to cool places like this. Dad was really into native American stuff. So these caves are the oldest pictographs on record from the Chumash indians showing when the Spaniards brought horses over to the new world. - Pretty cool. - I just thought you really needed to see this to understand me, Mike and dad a lot more and our experience up here. - Thank you. - No problem. Just don't tell anybody about it. It's a secret. (water gurgling) (solemn bagpipe music) Everything up here reminds me of you. The sounds. - [Narrator] Lieutenant Jack McKay was born July 7th, 1955. He was a proud father, a hard worker, an athlete, and most importantly, in the end a follower of Christ. His only goal in his last days was to help others have the peace and grace that can only come from a relationship with the Lord. He goes to his next life with excitement and anticipation. From this world, he will only miss his sons and their time together. (fire crackling) - [Mike] That was really beautiful out there on the river today. - Yeah it was pretty unbelievable. - Hey D, did dad tell you exactly where to drop off the ashes? - No, he just said spread them on the river. - Are you sure? - Yeah. - 'Cause that's the exact spot that dad and I were baptized in here last year. - No way. - I didn't know dad was baptized. - Yeah we were up here last year camping, he and I. We came up here July. You were working or something, you couldn't make it. But we were fishing one day and we were out there all day. We tried every hole we knew, we tried every fly that we had. We just couldn't catch a thing. Got skunked, one of those stinking days, you know. We were on our way back to the campsite when we run into this old man. He asked us how we did and we obviously didn't do well and he ends up busting out these little flies. He didn't tie them to himself but he had swore by these things. He said that they'd been working for him for over 50 years. They were designed after the native flies that were up there. He gave us a few and sent us on our way and we ended up going to the hole that he told us about and just killed it, we slayed it. The old man did better than I'd ever seen him do. - [Dylan] Yeah, how many fish did he catch? - I don't know, we lost count. I'm guessing 12 to 15 each. Something crazy. So that night we're at the campsite just talking when the old man that we saw, he ends up walking by us and stopping. Comes by and sits down, and the old man invites him down. He's like what's dad doing? - Now Paul was in isolation. When he was coming out, he realized that he had that outreach capability to make an influence on these others by expressing what he seen. Too many of us, we're being quiet. We never have a chance to really reach out to others who may be in need. - The next morning, we're out there on the river. We see that old man, he's out there in the middle of the river and he's got a guy and he's dunking him. Turns out, he was a pastor. I think in some church down in Orange County. Dad goes out there and he immediately gets baptized and as he came up, I swear to you this, it's real, this guy came up and he was completely different. And when I saw my dad and that look in his eye, the peace that he had, I believed, I believed instantly. Because if that man can change, that man can find peace, then anybody can. I thank God every single day that that old man was on that river. 'Cause I know that he was there for a reason and it was meant to be, no question in my mind. He was supposed to be there. - That's really cool. I wish I got to spend some more time with him. The only memories I have are the bad ones. I just couldn't let things go. Part of me wanted to forgive him. Just too much to get past. That's why when you talk about him like that it's hard for me. But lately, I felt him reaching out to me like never before. And it's crazy. All these things happening, I know what you guys mean. It can't be a coincidence, no way. (gentle music) (birds chirping) (steam hissing) - Hey. - Morning. - How you doing? - Good. So I'm curious, who does your hair? - I got this great guy back home. - Oh I thought he was in your tent this whole time. - You know, sometimes I'll bring him up on special occasions. But he was out of town, he was with Fabio. So yeah. - Well I want his number ASAP. - Hey, no problem, man, I'll text it to you, get your email. - [Rob] I wanna get a good hairdo going on like yours. - [Dylan] I will get you set up, bro. I would never let you walk around like that. - You are the Johnny Bravo of hair. - I know. I hear, it happens all the time. But you know what's gonna happen, you're gonna start getting a lot of chicks. (zipping) - [Mike] Hey, morning. - How'd you sleep? - [Mike] Not bad, how about you? - Pretty great. - So what's for breakfast? - You got two choices. - Yeah, what do we got? - Oatmeal. - And? - Oatmeal. - Well I guess I'll have oatmeal then. - Hey, Mike. - Yeah? - There's just one more thing we want to do before we left. We were wondering if you could help us out. - Sure. - Tell him. (uplifting music) - Do you believe Jesus Christ as the son of the one true God and invite him to be the Lord of your life? (dramatic music) Okay D. - I love you and I want to marry you. - You know who to be and what to do. - Do you believe that Jesus Christ is the son of the one true God and invite him to be the Lord of your life? 'Cause that's the exact spot that dad and I were baptized up here last year. (splashing) (light music) - Yoga mat, huh? - Yeah. - What's that? - It's dad's. - Whoah. - Pretty sweet, huh? - Yeah. It's great, thanks. - Yeah, no problem. Take care of it, all right? - Uh, anything else? - That's it, we're ready to go. - [Mike] Hey, thank you so much for coming. - Thanks for having me. It's a life-changing experience. - It wouldn't have been the same without you. Make sure you pick up that paint set, huh? - I will. - I hope so, 'cause you got a real gift. I'll see you back down foot. Right, love you bro. Hey, great job up here. Dad'll be so happy you did an awesome job. - I think so. - Yeah, definitely. So don't be a stranger back home, huh? - I never am. - Kind of. - Sometimes. - Maybe bring Becka over. - I will. - [Mike] Why don't you go see here when you get back? - I got a plan for her, don't worry about it. - You got a game plan? - You saw the ring from the Eat Dog, right? - Get it done. I got a game plan of my own, I'm about to hit the water. - Well why don't you hit the weights while you're at it? Do some pushups. - I'll see you back home. - All right. (calm music) - [Mike] After releasing Dad's ashes and my brothers finding the Lord, I knew that the trip was already a success. But being the competitor that I am, you know I had to get back on the river. So I tried every hole. Again, I tried every fly. But I couldn't catch a fish. So as I'm out on the river, it dawned on me. I wasn't meant to catch any fish this weekend. The Lord had made me a fisher of men. So although I didn't have any fish on the stringer, it was a great weekend on the river. Thank you Lord. (electronic music) - [Dylan] This is it, huh? - The Big Kahuna. Thanks for the ride. - You got it. - I really had fun, thanks for inviting me out. - I'm glad you had a good time. - There's something I've been wanting to show you. - What'd you got? - I thought he meant you. But now I know. He meant Him. - You need to put this in a safe spot.
