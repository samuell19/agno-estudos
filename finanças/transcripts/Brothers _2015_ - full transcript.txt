Where is it? Why is it in Paju? It took so long to get here. Hello! What the... What is this? How come no one's here? It's the first day. How come there are no desks? We're supposed to work like this here? This is my workplace. Do people work like this these days? What's up with this bed? They want us to sleep here? He knows about beauty better than women. Beauty Bible's only guy, Kwanghee. - Kwanghee. / - Hyoni! Hi. Hyoni. You're an international model. Kwanghee. You have big shoulder pads. Oh, today... Wow. Wow. Did you put something on your hips? No way. I can't believe you're so curvy. I'm a model, Kwanghee. She knows all about the trends. But she's more of a theorist. What's with the luggage? What's with this place? Hyoseong. Are you a country girl? You all came empty-handed? We're having it delivered. - Why bring it yourself? / - Really? She has to do everything herself. Hyoseong's full of passion. What did you bring? What is that? Who says you're a top editor? I thought I'd have a desk. Honestly, your first impression is very important. True, imagine a frumpy editor. So this is the best you can do? I'm wearing the best brands. The best! The best brands! I shaved my hair! Totally clean! I shaved my hair! Only where it's visible. Only where it's visible. You really are a top editor. I brought a whole bunch of stuff too. What's inside that? My makeup pouch and other stuff. I usually carry around 3 pouches. This is the limited edition of my solo album. This... Hyoseong is amazing. He said you're amazing just now. Hyoseong is really amazing. - What's this? / - Oh, this. Our schedule is important. - Secret calendar. / - Wow. Stop advertising your group! Geez. It's good to check your schedule with it. You didn't bring anything? Me? Myself. I brought myself. You must know a lot of stuff. - You meet international beauties. / - Yes. You're always ahead when it comes to fashion. And you recently modeled for all the collections. I'm so curious about what you two have prepared. We've prepared something to survive. - We'll see. / - We can't just die. Let's see what you've prepared. What we've prepared is very hot. The three unique editors will show us the real beauty world. What can you expect from Hyoseong? You'll become prettier with Beauty Bible. Aren't you just applying a bunch of makeup? What if Barbara Palvin comes here? Saying, "Hello, guys!" What is it? It's from abroad. It's here! We got a letter. You can follow the hottest beauty trends with just this one episode. It doesn't feel good for me at all. Then how do you maintain your figure? The first issue of Beauty Bible. "Cramming For The 2015 Trends." We have to start making the first issue right now. We have to fill in the blanks. So that the people can know the beauty trends at a glance. - I've prepared something. / - What? The fashion collection just ended. I've analyzed the recent makeup trends. Hello. I'm at the Seoul Fashion Week venue. As you see, there are tons of people. Since I'm not wearing makeup, I'll hurry up and go in. They're all saying you're pretty. The people in the fashion industry must really love top models. Models are more popular than celebrities around this time. - Of course. / - Right. Celebrities don't look as good there. - You know what I mean? / - Right. That's true. In March, Fashion Week was held in Seoul. It's the best place to learn the 2015 beauty trends. All the hot experts and models are here. You can meet all of them at the backstage of the fashion show. The trend of 2015 is the natural look. What are the models' skin care tips? I need to shoot this quickly. It's Wonjoong. - Wonjoong. / - Hyoni. - Hi. / - Hi. Isn't that Kim Wonjoong? Fashion advertisements are important but I think the beauty market is bigger. So I want you to win against other beauty show hosts, make tons of money with all different kinds of brands. - Go, Hyoni. / - He's so practical. Hi, Stephanie. Hello. I have a question. Tell me your secret beauty tip. - Beauty tip? / - Yes, your own special tip. Not something that everyone does. Put cold cotton all over your face. If you soothe your face, it becomes moist and less swollen. - In the morning? / - Yes, morning beauty tip. A real beauty tip. Drink a lot of water. That's too obvious. No. That's not good. I only use these fingers when I wash my face. Your ring fingers are the weakest. I don't want to irritate my skin. It'll take a million years to wash up. So it's a very meticulous wash. That's passionate cleansing. I have dry skin. So I use moisturizers quite often. Come here, Hyunyi. Is it over? - I'm about to do it. / - You're going to? Then before you go, tell me your skin care secret. You need to pay me. She knows money. Of course, I know about TV shows. Tell me your secret tip before you go. Or you can't go on the show. The best way to moisturize is to repeat application of serum with the smallest particles. That's a great tip. That was a good one. I'll send an invoice. You'd better go now. Bye. Not yet. Go now. I don't need to go yet. This interviewer is so arrogant. She's sitting down. That was a fun interview. Thank you. The best way to moisturize is to repeat application of serum. Put cold cotton all over your face. I don't want to irritate my skin. I only use these fingers. How were my interviews? Models always work overseas. Fashion and beauty are everyday life for them. I thought there would be something special. But they spoke about removing makeup, applying basic products and basic stuff... So you're saying it wasn't good? No, I was shocked. I expected something spectacular. And there was nothing spectacular? No, it was focused on the basics. First, we need to decide the title. - Something that grabs attention. / - Right. A catchphrase. I'm curious. I bet articles about Hyoseong have amazing titles. Like "Bursting..." Like "Busting out of her clothes." That's what they say. The reporters are always... What about "What happened backstage?" That's right! Since you take off your clothes backstage. Right. Actually, cleansing is removing makeup. "What did Hyoni remove backstage?" That's even worse. That sounds good. I actually like that. That's it. - We shouldn't help her. / - Really? - Prepare your own segment. / - Okay. I'm curious. What's your content? Since we're idol stars, we asked idol singers about their beauty secrets. - I'm curious. / - Let's watch the video clip. - He's hosting again. / - Like a host. - I'm used to it. / - You've been a host forever. Hi, I'm Kwanghee. I'm at a broadcasting station now. The prettiest beauty is here with us. I'm here to tell you some beauty tips. Follow me and let's find out who it is. She's in a girl group that always leads the beauty trends. Who is today's star? She's quite sensitive. She's hot too. She must be super hot. She's hot. I wonder who it is. Gain. She's known for her sexy charm and unique idol star makeup. All girls want to be like Gain. Even among celebrities, she's known for her hair and makeup and many celebrities copy her. She started the smokey eye makeup and the smudging lip makeup as well. Many idol stars imitate the look. A lot of people called themselves Gain when they wore smokey eye makeup. Everyone wants to copy her eye makeup. Tell me about your current eye makeup. Actually, I removed my makeup since I'm not performing now. But I wear a lot of loose pearls. So that my eyes look very sparkly. Many people copy that look, but they're not as pretty as you. You need compliment them for interviews. Is there a certain angle you go for? In my case, I don't do the cat eye makeup. I actually go downward. Oh, her ends go down, not up. We usually think the smokey eye makeup should go upward for an intense impression. But since it's intense enough, the downward angle softens it. Gain said the current trend is to draw it downward and make it longer. Is that why you drew yours downward too? We go to the same makeup salon. Kwanghee's wearing makeup too. Guys wear more makeup these days. You know who goes too? Lee Jungjae, Jung Woosung, Jang Donggun, G-Dragon, T.O.P, myself and Siwan. We all go to the same salon. What a hot place! Cramming the trend, number two. Drawing sexy eyelines. I'm here now. I'm the only one here but we have a big camera. The main director is there too? Since she's a female idol singer? Oh, I look great. Let's go meet the idol star for the first episode now. You're right behind me, right? My left profile looks better. Should I go like this? What's with her? Idol stars are all like that. She keeps looking into the camera. It's like a music show. It's hilarious. Her name is right here. You'll be shocked. She'll be shining brightly... She's so lively. She's very active. Our first episode's topic is hot trends. The hottest trend of the day. Your legs are so pretty. Your skin is pale too. So pretty. Girl groups have secrets about their legs? The star to reveal the secret of slim legs is... She has long Barbie doll legs. All the girls are jealous of Minah's body. The hottest trend of the day. I felt you'd be perfect. - Really? / - So I came to film you. Your legs are just flawless. Oh, please. Aren't they beautiful? I thought they used computer graphics. Your skin is pale too. Can I touch you? Of course. Your legs are so pretty. I bet you have a special method to keep your body slim and fit. Actually, my calves often become swollen. Yeah? I can't tell. If I work for a long time, I find my legs swollen. You have your main bone here. - Oh, here? / - You want to press it down. Oh, the front side? Yes. If you press them before bed, your legs will be fine in the morning. You know how girl groups wear body makeup to make our bodies stand out. Tell me some secrets on that too. - I actually just clump makeup on. / - Really? I tend to put on a lot of oil to look healthy. Let us know of any workouts you do for your body. I tend to work out before going to bed. - Before going to bed? / - Yes. I do some stretching before bed and when I wash my face, I shake my hips. Doesn't water splash everywhere when you go like this? It doesn't matter if it splashes everywhere since I'm alone. When Minah was talking about her legs, Hyoseong mentioned something she does too. I'm curious about that too. Contrast is key for people like us. I call it "2-2 makeup." 2-2? 2cm longer and 2cm thinner. She's good with coming up with names. Did you major in language? It's important to make them shiny. So go down the center. Near the bones. You can look fat if you go outwards. When you're doing that, you look so... I feel like I'm a pervert. Hyoseong looks sexy doing anything. When she does this... There are powder and cream types of shading products these days. Creams are popular now. The color... - What color is that? / - It's weird. - Why is it so dark? / - It's bronze. It spreads after you rub it on. I think you'd look bruised if you don't rub it well. - It's important to rub it well. / - Awesome. - Now they look thinner. / - It looks slim. It looks healthy, but thinner. So idol stars make their legs prettier like this. If you're really desperate... I heard there are simple workouts to get nice, sexy thighs. It looks really simple, but it's tough. You put a book between your legs and you keep it there for a while. That can't be hard. - Really. / - I want to try. You need to tighten your hips and strengthen your abs too. Let me try. - It's tough. / - My legs are thin like girls' legs. He's doing it now. It's easy, but... It's easy, but... Excuse me. - It's so tough. / - Please work out. It's a thick book, but it's really tough. Hang in there. I feel this part tightening. Your inner thighs and hips too. - Your hips tighten? / - They do. - I'm using my inner muscles. / - Right. The legs feel like they're getting thinner. You can also do abdomen workouts. It's really hard. You can totally tell he never works out. I see your effort pays off. Cramming the trend, three. Making sexy legs. Go down the center. You can look fat if you go outwards. You place a book between your legs and you keep it there for a while. I'll learn this makeup and use it for clubbing. The hair got on sideways. Whose hair is it? I'm not sure if it's just me, but she looks like Son Yejin. Aren't you just applying a bunch of makeup? I think we've wrapped up the first task. Now it's the beauty class. I think this segment is the most important. I bet the ladies like beauty class the most. The hottest trend... Oh! I'm so shocked. How can you just barge in? - You just came out of the blue. / - Hello. She came in all of a sudden. Hello, I'm Kim Hyojeong. I'm a makeup artist. You're the supporting model, right? I'm Wang Yujin. Nice to have you on the show. But we need more space for the class and show. Of course. We can make space here. I'll do it since I'm a guy. - Kwanghee is so strong. / - Are you okay? Gosh, this chair must be over 100kg. Don't overdo it. - We can put it here. / - Thank you. Just trust me. We're ready for makeup. - I'm satisfied. / - It's a lot. - Is it okay? / - Yes. It's perfect. We'll have a beauty class with the expert now. Why are you acting awkward? We need to do the beauty class. It has to go on the magazine. It's important. This makeup class... Since we're not professionals. I'll tell you makeup tips using the hot color of 2015. - Hot color? / - Yes. I know... - What color? / - I know what color it is. It's part of her outfit. Oh, I know. The gold brooch on her chest. Gosh. So I'm wearing gold too! - You're wrong. / - Wrong? It's not gold? You want to guess, Hyoseong? Marsala. That's correct. I looked into how it would look on the face as makeup. - It's bold. / - This feel... - But it's really chic. / - It's pretty. You can look innocent and pure. It's sexy. It can look sexy. I want to learn this makeup... And use it for clubbing. Why's he laughing like that? I think there's something that will come in handy for Hyoni. You'll show us a few tips? I'll show you 3 looks today. It's delayed attack Marsala makeup. Delayed attack. You apply makeup for different times? For different times. There's one color and you can apply makeup for different times? We'll have a certain focal point. Depending on the eye makeup, the overall flow or feel can seem very different. Since it's spring, I'll use Marsala. This will be a noon version for a brunch date. You'll use Marsala... It could look weird. You might look like you didn't remove your makeup from last night. It might look like you were beat up from afar. I'm worried. - That's not good. / - That's bad. Let's not be suspicious. I'll leave if you can't trust me. Please... No. In order to give an accent with Marsala, I'll make the skin look like there's hardly any makeup on. First, I'll wipe her face with toner on a cotton pad. The dead skin will come off on the cotton pad. I don't use towels. After I wash my face, when it's still wet, I lightly wipe it with cotton and wipe it off with toner. Is that better? So I never let my face get dry. So all my cosmetics are in my bathroom. So you can use them right away after you shower? We'll start the base makeup now. As you see, I'll mix makeup base and foundation. The skin will become more moist and the complexion will improve when you add the makeup base. But with noon makeup, the skin is essential. I tried to make it look natural. It's like she's not wearing makeup. She really is covered up now. Her skin was red before. She had no makeup on earlier. Now her face looks so clean. She looks like Son Yejin. She looks like Son Yejin after the makeup. Yeah. The skin is really important. I'm going to draw the eyebrows now. Use an eye shadow similar to the color of your brows and brush it on roughly. Just fill in the inner eyeline to make it look natural. That brush is used like a seal for people who have trouble applying eyeliner. - That gives a big change. / - Clear line. The eyeline is important but eyelashes are also important for pretty eyes. I don't think she'll do them. I'll show you how to make them look long with just mascara and an eyelash curler. - Without extensions? / - No. Tell me. My mom drives me nuts. I'm going insane because of this. She wants me to get coupons. Clamp the lashes at the base. Base? And you go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. They went right up. You can use regular mascara? This is transparent. I'll show you. No color... Come here. Transparent mascara. - They're getting longer. / - They are. They're thicker. Can you see the hair? Whose hair is it? - Oh, what is it? / - Do you see the hair? What is it? It's not my hair. There's hair inside the mascara? - The product is made like that? / - Yes. That's great. That transparent mascara is like... Is it real hair? Oh, my... I've never seen anything like that. Me too. I want to try. It's great. But it looks gross. I've never seen you wear makeup. It's awkward for me too. It's getting longer, right? No, excuse me... The hair got on sideways. Get it on the right way. Like this. Oh, it's longer now. What is it? It's so long now. Only one eye is much bigger! Wait. You'll become so popular. When it goes on the magazine... Just forget about Marsala. - Go with mascara? / - That's the idea. You did the eyelashes first. If the eyes stand out too much, it might not look pretty. So you use the mascara for a bit of structure first. Then you add the shadow. You'll see that less is more. I'll use Marsala color for eye makeup. I'll use this lipstick for eye shadow. Control the amount. Mix it with a bit of foundation with a lip brush. Lip brush... If you like heavy makeup, make it dark. If you want to look natural, add a bit more concealer. Apply it to the outer corner. Open your eyes. See? It's a subtle look. - Eyes look deep. / - There's subtlety. She looks pure and innocent. I'll give you another tip. You use this at home, right? You mix it with this. Oh, lotion and a shimmer shadow? Wouldn't it be sticky? The shadow is made of powder, so it evens it out. - Really? / - Yes. Will you apply Marsala on the lips too? Yes. There is a wide variety. If you want to look young, dab a reddish tone like this. Now that her lips have color, she looks lightened up. I think this line of colors suits those with dark skin. Look at this color. - It really doesn't suit me. / - Pink? My face looks darker with this color. If you have dark skin, you shouldn't wear brownish burgundy. - Really? / - Your skin looks darker. You can't tell where the lips are? You look very ill. - You look ill? / - That's right. If you want to add more moisture, apply lip gloss or lip lacquer. That was a refreshing look. Now I'll show you an upgraded edgy, sophisticated look for 7 p.m. You go on dates around then. That's when you get off work. You're hungry and you make dinner plans. Right. You can have dinner at a hot place. I'll use a burgundy shadow. I'll use it as a liner by spraying mist on it. Dab your brush in it. I didn't draw a thick line earlier. So it didn't stand out too much. You'll have more formal appointments at 7 p.m. Wow. The right eye looks so deep. Watching her... I think this goes so well with the look because there's no shading or blush. The noon look only focused on the lips. Since the eyes didn't stand out, it looked innocent. She only added color to the eyelids, but they look bigger and sophisticated. Her impression totally changed. I'm not sure if it's just me, but she looks like Son Yejin. She wears heavy makeup in a scene in "A Moment To Remember." I think she looks like her in that scene. Treat me after the recording is over. I gave you so many compliments. I said you're pretty. Next is 11 o'clock. - 11 p.m.? / - 11 p.m. The makeup keeps getting heavier. When it's 11 p.m., are you just going to put a lot of makeup on her eyes? I'll make her look very sexy later. Really? - 11 p.m.? / - Yes. This color will be best for 11 p.m. You'll like it. You'll need it today. Since you need to go clubbing. I think 11 p.m. is when all women, you know... Keep going. That's when they start to seduce men. Though many sleep at that hour too. At 11 p.m.? Those who wait for 11 p.m. want to seduce others. You can seduce them during the day. You can seduce men in broad daylight? Sure. What do you do at night? - The makeup will be sexier? / - Of course. Since you'll be in a darker space, you can think of it as sparkly makeup under subtle lighting. You're going under the eyes. Yes, we're getting into club makeup. Makeup under the eyes looks sexy. I can't do without makeup there. I love doing under eye makeup too. Guys wear under eye makeup too. It gets crazy on the stage. I heard guys' makeup takes longer. I'll cover the top with gray. You're using gray instead of Marsala? Yes, if you use too much of Marsala, you could just look too tough instead of sexy. She's ready for clubbing now... Her eye looks much bigger. Yeah. Each side of her face is totally different. I bet guys like this look. Guys like innocent, but sexy looks. Girls that look too sexy, just look scary. She looks so pretty. Awesome. I think the gold shimmer from the noon makeup makes her look even prettier. I've been talking a lot. But shall I try it now? I bet it'll suit Hyoseong. Everything looks good on her. That's a pencil type. Pencil type. This has a vivid color. It's a totally different color from hers now. I'm wearing hot pink lipstick, but I'll remove it. Is it coming off? I'm embarrassed now. I've never done this before. My mom does that before bed. She wants to make it clean. She goes like this. She leaves it right beside the sofa. Did you learn makeup from your mom? I became a beauty show host thanks to her. I can tell she's an expert just by looking at her wear it. I'm jealous of her thick lips. My lips are so thin. I only wear it inside my lips. My lips are so thin, I look ugly when I wear those. I use my hands quite often. You need to work on the gradient. Kwanghee doesn't seem to like it. She looks like an Asian ghost. It's only in the center. He's so hilarious. Stop coming to me. It's scary only in the center. He's so hilarious, I'm dying now. Her lips look like mine now. Her lips became thin. Good job, Hyoseong. Jun Hyoseong is so sexy. Jun Hyoseong is sexy. Mix makeup base and foundation for moist skin. After curling your eyelashes, give your lashes a natural extension with mascara containing black fiber. If you use eye shadow combining Marsala lipstick and concealer, you complete an innocent noon version look. Spray mist into burgundy shadow and use it as an eyeliner. If you add contour at the outer corners with brownish Marsala shadow, a deep 7 p.m. version look is complete. If you draw a black line under the eyes and use a gray shadow on the eyelids, a sultry Marsala makeup look is complete for 11 p.m. We did the interviews and finished the beauty class too. Let's go home now. No, we still have a lot to do. This looks interesting. Global beauty news. Fast-changing trends. Trendsetters will give us beauty tips from all around the world. Global beauty news from correspondents on site. What if Barbara Palvin suddenly pops out? Saying, "Hello, guys." Nice. Hello, viewers of Beauty Bible. Hello, viewers of Beauty Bible. This is Japan and my name is Miho. Our very first correspondent is new YouTuber of Japan, Miho. I'll introduce the most popular beauty item in Japan. It's so popular that they introduced it on Japanese television. It's totally sold out now. I came to a market. The items are inexpensive there. It's in the cosmetics section. They have many interesting items. You are right. It's number one product. This is great. It must be very popular. Japanese ladies love this product. The silicone mask pack. A popular Japanese YouTuber introduced it. She got over 100,000 views. Amidst the flood of positive reviews... This popular silicone mask pack is popular among both men and women. Do you have silicone mask packs? We don't have any left. Wow, none left. It's that popular? They didn't have any silicone mask packs there. So I came to a different branch. - Was this set up? / - None again. We don't know when it'll come in. So I came to another place. I'd better look for silicone mask packs. It must be here now. I have a feeling. You could get angry at those time. - When you really want to buy it. / - It's annoying. It's exhausting. Maybe you can't find them in Japan. Oh, gosh. Oh, gosh. Oh, my... Ta-da! She got it. I went for an auction. It's so expensive. It's usually about $1 per pack, but it went up to $4.50. Through the auction... Put on sheet mask and then... Like this. We used to have to lie down after applying a facial mask. It's great because we can move around. I'm Miho in Japan. Thank you. Bye! Awesome. I want that. I'd like to see that too. Editors have quick access, right? We should experience it and share about it quickly. I visited a fashion company when I was overseas. It was insane. They had all the new products. People send it to them like that. How come it's vacant here? It's because it's the first issue? It'll be filled up soon. Something came. Is it for us? - Oh, what is it? / - It's from abroad. It's here! - It's from Japan. / - For us? I'm so excited. We got a letter. From Writer Lee Sujin. Lee Sujin removed her makeup and sent an invoice for the auction. $4.50 and shipping cost of $20. She wants a total of $50. She sent a letter. - There's one here. / - Just one? The shape is nice. I have a lot of silicone in my face too. Like this... It's convenient as you can hang it on the ears. It sticks to the face. You can move around. Wow, it doesn't fall off. You can go like this too. This is great. It's tight too. It's very tight. On the chin too. A lifting effect. The liquid wouldn't drip down. Right. Many people grind stuff for facial packs. Things like cucumbers. This will stop natural packs from dripping. It's nice. Oh, my... Kwanghee wore so much makeup. Look. Gosh. It shows how it sticks really well. Let's look at the instructions. What? The literal translation is this. "You can use this pad and move or sleep as you wish." When you use it in the bath... - It's very effective. It works. / - Yes. It must be great for baths. It has a great steaming effect. Do they sell this in Korea too? I've used a silicone pack before. I applied serum and then put on the silicone pack. I could move around since it didn't fall off, but it was expensive. How many times can you use this? It says it's semipermanent. I don't think you can use this many times by keeping it clean. I think you can replace it once a month. Kwanghee made it a bit dirty. You want it? No, I'd rather just order another one. From now on... Your mark is so vivid. Whenever there are samples, I'll try it and keep it. - I'd better try it first. / - Right. We need a title for this too. For this too? We need to add "Limited," "Sold out." "Exclusive! Only on Beauty Bible! Silicone pack that Japan goes nuts about." Sounds good. That sums it up. - "Nearly sold out." / - Important words... Say it all. No. "Already sold out." "Already sold out?" Hot beauty item straight from Japan. Silicone mask packs. There's one left now, right? Will a fitness instructor come? I think so. I hope she comes. The popular instructor. - Who? / - Who? You know. Yu Seungok. Maybe Yu Seungok is coming. I hope... She's here. - Excuse me. / - She must be here. What if it's not her? I bet it's a male instructor. Gosh. I shouldn't have given him cologne. I hope she comes. The popular instructor. - Who? / - Who? You know. Yu Seungok. She's here. - Excuse me. / - She must be here. Gosh. I shouldn't have given him cologne. What the... What is it? Who is it? What is this? What is this? What's with the remote control? They want us to watch it on the screen? - What is this? / - Geez. It doesn't feel good for me at all. My arms hurt so much. I can't help but moan. What should we watch? Hello. I'm Song Daeun. Hello. Hello. I'm Song Daeun. I'll teach you workouts you can do at home with simple items in your house. For 4 weeks... - For 4 weeks? / - In 4 weeks. Four weeks. I'll teach you how to make a perfect body to seduce a guy in 4 weeks. I'll teach you how to make a pretty neck... - And collarbones. / - That's important. You all have towels, right? We'll start making a pretty neck and collarbones with the towels right now. I'll pause and bring towels now. I'll bring them. We have towels? There must be in the bathroom. He knows everything. Pick your favorite color. Prepare your towels. Fold your towels twice horizontally. Move your elbow forward. As you breathe in and exhale, move both arms to the right. Tilt your head far to the left. Do the same for the opposite side. Do it slowly as you breathe. I can feel the stretch on the back of my neck. It feels so good. It feels so good. I think it's a good arm workout too. It relaxes your muscles. It really works. I think I'm doing it wrong. It doesn't feel good for me at all. - Look. / - Hold it. Do it like this. Tilt your head this way. Don't your muscles feel the stretch? Yeah. How did you end up with such a good figure? Next, stretch your elbows back as you inhale. Lift up your chin and stretch out the front of your neck. The towel should be tight. Don't drop it. As you exhale, stretch out your elbows. Curl your body into a ball and face your belly button. The key is to tighten the area around your collarbones. Hyoseong. Hyoseong. Exhale and tighten your collarbones. Yes. Is she watching me? Scary! Next. Twist your towel 90° to the right and tilt your head to the left as you exhale.
