.... There are questions that very few people ever have to ask themselves in their lifetime, but every IndyCar driver probably has to ask at least once in their career. "What happens when I hit a wall at 200 miles per hour? What will the forces more than 100 times of the Earth's gravity feel like when it compresses my body? Who will come for me? Who will help me?" .... waiting patiently in trucks, any number of ways. And they're the first to arrive on the scene when this happens. IndyCar is unique in the motorsports world in that they are one of the few racing series that support a dedicated safety team that travels to all of the races. We're all firefighters, paramedics on the trucks. We have three trucks, four guys on each truck. There's an incident command person, or the crew leader, there's a paramedic, and then we have two firefighters that sit in the back seats. Their responsibility is the seat they're sitting in. So the driver is the crew leader, front seat's the paramedic, firefighter one sits behind the paramedic, firefighter two sits behind the driver. Safety team manager, Mike Yates and crew leader, Mike Kareya are veteran members of the Holmatro safety team. Much of their work begins before a car even sets a tire on the track. Usually, it's the day before the activity starts on the weekend. Mike and I will come to the track in the morning. Try to do a couple of laps around the track, just to see if there's anything different from what we've done from last year to this year. There's changes that have to be made a lot of times, but they're small, and they can be handled before the weekend starts. Our trucks themselves, the way they're hauled now, they're on an open hauler So we have to take all of that stuff out of the trucks and set the trucks up. That takes another two or three hours usually. We have a 40-gallon tank of water in our truck. This is our hose, it's operated by nitrogen pressure. This is our IndyCar starter. If the car stalls we use these to restart the car and send him on his way. It's what the teams use when they're in the pits, starting their cars. This is just Oil-Dri containers. We get oil on the track, we just put this down and brush that oil till we get racing conditions again. This is lifting harnesses for the cars. This is what we pull out... We have an incident on the track, or a car blows apart or we can't pull it in. These are all used to keep the driver... We get the driver out of the car in a safe manner, not dragging out any problems with him. This is the AP units for the Holmatro tools, they're electric. Got the core technology on them. This one's hooked up to the cutter. The other APU, it's hooked up to our spreader, so if we have to spread the compartment of the car and get some intrusion, in the car with a driver to get him out. We'll put those in there and spread the cockpit of the car out. Every track on the IndyCar schedule already has a team of firefighters, paramedics and doctors, who manage safety at the individual tracks. working with local safety teams is an essential part of the job I usually like to have anywhere from three to four local trucks. And that's in combination with our three trucks. Most of the time, or if not always, they've been around their race track for a long time. So I take as much information from them as they get from me. And so what we do is we have safety meetings every day and explain to them what their responsibilities will be. We do not dispatch on sight. We do want to dispatch from Control. Make sure they tell you when to go. They got a pretty good sight lines here, so they can get you out there safely. But we want you to get out there as quickly as we can 'cause we want somebody making sure that the driver is okay. When a crash happens, the safety team functions under a system of procedures and protocols that dictates the role every team member plays on the track. Our dispatcher's been with us for a while. His name's Jim Norman. And he's up in the tower, he can see everything that's going on. He'll call the triple yellow. Yellow flags. Yellow flags. Proceed with caution. It's too close. Proceed with caution. It's too close. There's three different areas that we came up with. There's your impact area, where the car makes impact with the wall. There's where the car comes to rest. And then you have a debris field between those two. So those are three areas you need to address immediately. The truck that's closest to the car would go to the car. The truck that's going to the impact point will stop at the impact point. The paramedic goes straight to the driver to see if he's injured, and if so, what type of injury. Are we gonna be able to send him standing up and ambulatory, or are we gonna have to extract him from the car, those sorts of decisions. Firefighter one always comes off with a pressurized water container. Firefighter two comes off with a five-gallon Oil-Dri container. It's got Oil-Dri in it. His job, if they broke their oil line, he dams up the oil, keeping it contained to the car as tightly as he can. The incident commander, the crew leader gets out of the car, kind of sizes up the scene pretty quickly. Cause while we're doing' all this, television is wanting to know when we're going green, fire control is the same. At the impact point, the crew leader inspects the damage to the wall, the facility, the track, the fence. If there's any damage to any of these he can call in the local resources and the track restoration people to fix whatever needs to be fixed, so we can continue racing. The third truck in, that's usually our clean-up truck. And it will drop its three-man crew off at the race car. If they don't need any help, those three guys will start walking back up towards the impact point on the racetrack, cleaning debris. The other two guys that are on the impact point truck, they will start walking towards the race car, picking up debris. Then when those people meet, they turn around and they walk back to their respective trucks. Our doctors ride in a separate truck. And that's our 1200 car. It's an SUV type vehicle. When we're outside of the State of Indiana, we'll do basic life-support. If there's any advanced life-support that has to be done, we defer to the local paramedics that work on the ambulances and the rescue vehicles that are on the scene with us. Then they function under their local medical director, which is there on the scene. We work really well together with all the tracks. There's a respect we gain from each other when we're there. So we try to work as closely with those folks as we can. The benefit is there's a core group of guys, we work together every weekend. The drivers know who we are. They feel comfortable about looking up and seeing somebody that they know. When a crash occurs, the safety team are the first responders who arrive to safeguard the driver before turning their attention to packaging up damaged cars and cleaning the track, so racing can resume. This looks like the end of the incident. But in IndyCar, these are just the first steps in a cascade of analyses that take place after an accident. Jeff Horton, an engineer by training, leads a group for IndyCar that analyzes on-track accidents. My main role is accident investigation. Once Mike Yates' team gets done with it on the racetrack, they package it up, put it on a wrecker and it comes back to us. That's when we do an investigation of it. Regardless of the damage or whether there was an injury or not, we record as much information as we can about that accident. And we take pictures of the car, so we understand the damage. I take pictures for the database that we keep on all the accidents. Specifically, what I'm doing is not only taking pictures of the current damage, but also damage that we can't necessarily see. Just so that we can keep a complete database on all the parts. And then I download the crash box itself. Every IndyCar contains a crash recorder that provides data which the accident investigation group can analyze immediately. in a mobile office that travels to every race. We've got about six pages of graphs and summary data. And that includes the impact levels from the car, and the driver's ear accelerometer, which they wear in their ears. So these are the custom ear sensors that we make for every driver. There's an electronics package which consists of three accelerometers which measures each of the three axes. So we've got forward, backward, left, right, up and down, the force that's acted on the driver's head, and then the little red thing you can see is a covering for the speaker that you use to hear and communicate from the team's radio. So this is a custom piece, the mold itself is all custom to each driver. These are 100 percent made inside IndyCar. The data is captured in the crash box itself. So it's perfectly lined up with the accelerations of the car. So this is our one interface to the drivers to tell what they're going through during an accident. The crash box tells us what the car is going through and then the ear accelerometers tell us what the driver's going through. During an IndyCar qualifying session, driver Charlie Kimball makes hard contact with the SAFER Barrier that momentarily lifts his car off the track. Charlie was fortunate enough to walk away from the crash while the accident investigation team steps in to perform an analysis of the impact. Since we have all three axes, this is the first hit. So based on the polarities, so we've got a left-rear... Left-front hit, excuse me. So we know when the longitudinal forces are negative that's front. And we know that the lateral, when it's negative, that's the left side of the car. So we know that he hit left-front. So we're looking at a 40G and an 85G hit. The actual result of that when you add those together was 93Gs. One of the major innovations from IndyCar is the SAFER Barrier. A wall of foam and steel tubing that rings the outside of the track and absorbs some of the high-G impact from an accident. At places like Indianapolis, where the speeds are up in the angles that they hit, typically, it attenuates down to about a 60G pulse. Which is dramatic, 'cause a bare concrete wall would have been over 100 in the past. So they do a very good job of attenuating. But with the damage that was done to that car, again, you're talking well over 100Gs and a concrete wall versus the SAFER walls. We're lucky that during a sanctioned event, which means either a race weekend or an open test, we have a full selection of cameras we can use. And that's invaluable when you're looking at replaying an accident. 'Cause you're gonna actually see what happened. There were two initial hits, the big one we just talked about. There is another one, probably as the car spun around and then there was a time he was in the air and not really hitting anything, and that's about 1.4 seconds. So there's one, two, the small one, three, four, five, six, seven. There's basically ten substantial hits. His very first hit all happened in a time frame of probably 30 milliseconds. It's a fairly wide impact in our world, so he's gonna feel that. But a lot of times now, we can tell from that that there's a probability that there's an injury or there's a potential for an injury, and sometimes it doesn't show up. So, like, with Charlie, I'll wait 48 hours and call him. For many, many years now Dr. Trammell has been involved with us. The two of us together work very well. He's an orthopedic surgeon with a big mechanical background. I'm an engineer that understands the cars very, very well. So we can look at both sides of the kinematics of a crash. We can look at the car and what went on with that and Dr. Trammell can tell us about the body and what we would need to do to prevent those injuries. The biggest thing is we've had so many accidents over time that you can predict a probability of a particular kind of injury from the crash pulse. So for example, if we have a 90G vertical crash pulse, that's just a big spike in the bottom of the car, with enough width, that's predictive of a spine fracture. During the final lap of a race in Houston, driver Dario Franchitti suffered spinal injuries and a concussion in a violent crash that caused him to retire from racing. We understand a lot of the loading levels that are potential to cause injury. Now, most of the time a driver will feel that when he gets out and we especially look at the head Gs and then any vertical Gs, and if there's any markers in the data, which means high level Gs we calculate what we call a HIC value, which stands for Head Injury Criterion. Then I let the nurses and the doctors know, "Hey, pretty big head hit." So the data always gets looked at real quick. The doctors need that information, we get it to them as quick as we can. All of this graphing, logging, and data collection serves a very immediate need to spot any potential health risks to the drivers involved in a crash. But it also serves a much bigger purpose in the goal to expand IndyCar safety. The rest of the year, we do a lot of research. Which includes sled testing, drop-tower testing, and things like that, so it's a complete closed-loop system, where what we learn at the racetrack we can go in and make improvements to the cars, whether it's new seats, new headrests, safety devices for the drivers. Then they will implement them into the rules in the years to come as soon as we get them ready and make sure they're the right thing to do. My memory kind of fades out about the start of that lap. Kicks back in, you know, waking up in ICU, on a ventilator. At the time I had absolutely no memory of how I got there. Leading up to the 99th running of the Indianapolis 500, the safety team and IndyCar officials were focused on issues that were causing drivers to get airborne in single car crashes during practice. Fortunately, there were no major injuries from the accidents. And IndyCar moved quickly to implement changes to protect driver safety. By the final practice session, it looked like a solution had been found. But the safety team is always ready when the unforeseen happens. So we were out there, it was early in the session, I think maybe an hour in, and I was running around there just trying to do some draft practice, and you know, work on the race car. The accident all started when the right front rocker failed. And that's a very, very rare failure. I've seen cars hit the wall very hard and the rockers are still fine. That's just not a piece that, traditionally, has an issue. Oh, and a hard contact! James Hinchcliffe. Yellow, yellow, yellow, we were dispatched. It was up on the north end, in turn three, coming out of three and four, and we were stationed in one and two. When Safety 3 got to the car, the crew leader on that vehicle called a Code zero-five. Our codes go 01 as an ambulatory driver, uninjured. Code zero-two is orthopedic, zero-three is a change of level of consciousness, like a concussion. Five is like a multi-systems life threat. When we got that code, we went on instead of the impact point, we went on down to the scene. When I got there, of course, we were having trouble getting him up out of his seat. Basically, the piece of suspension, it went in the tub end, entered me right under my, kind of, right butt cheek. And it came out up around my left hip. And so the biggest amount of damage was actually through my left glute, there was essentially a couple of inch diameter metal rod that went straight through the muscle of my left glute. I couldn't get my fingers between his hips and the seat, so we figured that the tub was compressed. And we got the spreaders and put them down in and spread the tub. We heard the tub pop a couple of times, and then it became loose. They realized that there was no way to get me out of the car with that piece of suspension still in me. They apparently looked at me and said, "All right, here's the situation. We need to pull you out of the car and once we start, we're not stopping until you're out of this car. So you can kick and you can scream and you can swear, you can do whatever you want. But once we start pulling, we're not stopping until you are off this piece and out of this car." The impalement that he had from the suspension created some issues with bleeding. They got me into the ambulance and immediately were just trying to pack the wounds and try and stop the bleeding. We stopped by the Care Center and picked up the surgeon. You know, if you've got a driver that's critically injured in your ambulance, and you're headed to the hospital. And that surgeon is sitting there next to you, he sees what you're doing and the problems that you're having. So he's got a pretty good idea what he's gonna have to do when this driver gets to him. And when we got to Methodist, it was almost immediately, he went straight to the shock room and then straight up to surgery. I had two operations. One to take care of the artery that was hit as the suspension went through me. It hit my femoral artery, and you know, bleeding out was the big worry of that day. I mean, when I think about the idea of a piece of metal that size going through my body at that place, and literally, all that was hit was muscle, and no organs, nothing else. I mean, the artery, yeah, but that could've just been so much worse. Oh, and a hard contact! James Hinchcliffe. My involvement would've been the same as it would've been for any other accident. The race car was packaged up, put on a wrecker and brought back to me. Because of that level of that injury, at the time, we took that back to a secure area. It was quite evident from the video we saw that it looked like a suspension failure that caused him to, basically, drive directly into the wall. We took a quick look at the failure, that had actually happened. We wanted to make sure we weren't gonna see that same type of failure, or at least put another driver through that. So, immediately, that was our focus there. As the parts came back, we laid them out. We do very much like airplane reconstruction sometimes, where we lay the parts out relative to the top. The analysis that was done on the suspension failure and some of the suspension piece that broke into car, some changes have been made to that to make it safer. By the next day, I think, they had already designed a piece to add to the lower wishbones, that if it were to snap off its pickup point and not bend it would slide along the tub rather than be forced into it. So there were things, literally within 24 hours that the series had implemented to make sure it didn't happen again. Mike sat with me the next day and we went through everything. We went through the crash loads and the video, the post-accident pictures. One of the challenges of that accident was the way the suspension piece had come through the tub, through the seat so they didn't know why he was hung up. So the goal is to try to understand if we could develop new tools to help them either chop in to the side of the tub, spread the tub apart, something beyond the tools they had today to make that analysis easier and quicker. We never quit thinking, especially when drivers have been injured. It's still ongoing, even after all this time. We're still looking at ways, whether it's extrication or to make the car safer. So there's been a lot of changes that came out of that accident. Between the people that showed up at the car first, the experience they had, the decisions they made, you know, in that short period of time, the hospital staff and the quality of hospital that I ended up at, I mean, any one of those things not being in place... Who knows? Even as a little kid, when I used to watch the IndyCar races, for me, what fascinated me apart from the racing and the technology and the speed was how well those people organize having their own hospital on site, with their own doctors and people that understand about the job. People don't realize how much IndyCar did for safety in racing. IndyCar works hard to improve driver safety with a team of safety workers, doctors, and engineers. But they also have an open channel of communication with the people who have the most to gain or lose on the track. I'm the president of the driver's association. Our connection with IndyCar is extremely open. So it's just pick up the phone and say, "We have an issue." We'll have a drivers meeting or we'll have an email that we say, "Hey, this is a concern. Somebody just put a concern out." We discuss between us how we are gonna put this to IndyCar so they can understand. I'm the drivers' medical advocate. The Professional Drivers Association is really just a communications network of the current drivers. The ultimate function is to be able to foresee and anticipate circumstances that could produce injury and try and prevent them before they occur. We found that if drivers had questions, whether it was head-rest padding, seat-belt fit, either them or their team managers would come see us and ask us questions. It's very rewarding when they come to ask you, "What should I do in a safety situation?" We travel together, so we're with them, every weekend we're on the road. It's not uncommon for us to be working on the car after the accident situation, where we're cataloging, and the driver's been released and walks back up. Depending on what it is, I'll talk to him and see what they went through. It's always good having first-hand information, see it they hurt anywhere. So they're always around, we're always talking to them. It's always a development. And you kind of pin-point what's important for the series, what's important for safety, for us, for the fans. Every move we make in IndyCar, it's very well thought of. I'm not saying we're gonna get it right all the time. But it's not like somebody just came up and said, "We need to put this there." Then we're being irresponsible. But we're not gonna get it right all the time. We give an annual presentation to the drivers. My opening statement is always, "If you get hurt, I take it very personally. If you get hurt, I feel like I've failed you in some way because we didn't anticipate your situation, your injury and prevent it. However, if you get hurt because you didn't do something that we told you to do, because we knew it would protect you from this injury, I take that equally as personally, and I will be in your face." After a devastating crash, fast action from the IndyCar safety team and doctors saved James Hinchcliffe from what could've been a fatal accident. In hospital, James started down the road to recovery. The injuries were largely soft tissue damage through my legs and pelvic region. Unfortunately, the best thing that you can do for that for a certain amount of time is nothing. As a competitive person, you wanna push, you wanna get better as fast as possible, right? And they're like, "No, that's great. But to do that we need you to do nothing." And that was so hard for me to kind of wrap my head around. You want to be doing as much as possible to get better. And then once I was cleared to sort of start moving again, it started off with, you know, just simple things like walking. I would be given a step counter and told, "All right, this day you're allowed to do this many steps, no more. And the next day you can do this many steps and no more." So I would do laps around my couch with my pedometer until I hit my steps. And then I'd go sit back down. When you're sitting down, basically, for two months, you lose a lot of muscle and you lose a lot of flexibility. Honestly, getting the flexibility back and some of the stretching that took place was some of the most painful part of the rehab because, you know, you have all these muscles and all this tissue that's been damaged and freshly repaired. Now you're trying to stretch it out for the first time. Man, there were some times there where it was just pure agony. First time you're picking up dumbbells, and they're five pounds. My trainer's like, "All right, take it easy." I'm like, "What?" Again, that's part of the mental side of that kind of rehabilitation. As much as you want to push, you need to know where that limit is and finding that point was really challenging. The other thing that wasn't as widely reported was I actually had quite a bit of damage to my neck. And obviously, that's a pretty big part of driving a race car, you need to have a strong neck. And for a long time that's what worried me, was that that wasn't going to be good enough ever again for me to drive a car or road course. I stopped shaving, and you know, my beard kinda took on a life of its own, and it was sort of a thing there for a while, but the fact of the matter is I stopped shaving 'cause I didn't wanna see what I looked like. Because I'd lost so much weight. Just muscle atrophy, and not being able to eat, really, at first. It is a really helpless feeling, in a sense, you know. I mean, it's all I know. Like, racing is not a job, it's a life. The harder part was knowing that I was in no condition to be at the track. You know, it's one thing to not be there, but it's another thing to know that even if you have the opportunity to be there, you couldn't do it. I could barely sit on a couch, never mind the thought of being tossed around in an IndyCar. The support from everybody that poured in after that... It was the most incredible part of this entire experience, really. And there's no doubt that seeing all that support from everybody, it really helped on the bad days. I remember when I got to Toronto, it was my first time back at the track. And I saw Mike. I mean, I nearly broke into tears. I just hugged him. It was, uh... That was a pretty emotional moment. There's no words, you know. I don't know... I'm usually pretty good at talking. I think anybody who knows me well will admit that, but there was just nothing to say. I had no vocabulary to express how I felt, and the gratitude and the appreciation, and all that. So it was literally just a whole lot of hugs and almost tears kinda thing, standing in the middle of the racetrack, and it's... What's so awesome about them is none of them are looking for any accolades, or, you know, recognition in any sense. This is just what they do, you know, and they care about you as much as, you know, as much as they would family. Because like I said, this is a big family. With the track dormant in the dead of winter, the safety team gathers in Indianapolis to review the previous race season and train for the upcoming season. We have cameras in our trucks, so we can actually watch safety, too, pull up and see exactly what they're doing at a race car, whether they're extracting the driver or how bad it is. That'll mentally prepare us for what we have to do once we get there to help. At this point, we've got a pretty good action circle going here. If Safety 3 gets to the car first, his job is to secure the scene, pass on information to the next truck in, and make sure they know what's going on. The thing is, what you have to do when someone is injured, you have to critique that, you have to download everything you did and look at it, and, "Can I improve the outcome of what happened to them in that accident the next time?" After reviewing and discussing a series of on-track incidents, the safety team moves to a workshop for training, and to try new tools provided by the safety team's sponsor, Holmatro. What we're gonna do today is use the hydraulics up here by the car. We're gonna use the saw blade that he's got back here and we're just gonna try to cut down to the floor. Then again, we're gonna take our spreaders and try to get this down and break it down to the floor, and just see how quickly we can do that. We're looking at trying to design a tool that would make it a lot easier for us to access where we needed access. We work with our technical department, brainstorm and put these things together, present this thing to Holmatro engineers to help us develop this tool that's needed. You can imagine what the inside of an IndyCar, the footbox looks like. If you see the outside you know how small it is. Well, it's even smaller inside. We take the nose off a car, we can get down in there and actually, if they're tangled up, we can use these cutters in there. You could always improve on what you do, that's why we train. It is to get better and faster at what you do and more efficiently. Especially working with these type of cars, the space you have to work with is very confined. And working in that confined space, it's a little technical stuff, getting the drivers out sometimes, you gotta take the head surrounds out, gotta take the steering wheel out, we train on that so we know how to do it very efficiently. Responding to accidents and driver injuries on the track is the main purpose of the IndyCar safety team. But they also function in many different capacities during a race. On a road and street course, we're like an over-the-wall crew. Only we work for every team out there. We carry IndyCar starters, we carry the, you know, quick jacks, and we get to a car, we might have to pull it out by the tires, get it turned around, get it sent on its way. It's a matter of just sorting out what's in front of you. Everybody thinks that they should be the first one started. We'll take a verbal beating all day long, it doesn't hurt us. Now, if their arguing keeps us from doing our job, and it's costing us time on the racetrack, we'll kind of push back a little bit, but in order to have the personality to get out and drive these cars, they're pretty type A personalities anyway. And then if you add fuel to the fire by pushing on that, make a bad situation worse. I enjoy motorsports, I enjoy being at the racetrack. I enjoy all the stuff in between. I don't necessarily enjoy the crashes, But that's why we're here, is for that. And we're here to take care of the drivers and get them back on the track as quickly as possible. Ninety nine percent of the time, it's fun. You get that one percent of the time where it's not so fun. The safety crew is there to ensure the safety of the drivers. But there are risks to working on a track with cars that weigh 1,500 pounds and behind a pace car, are often traveling 80 miles an hour. There's rules that they have to slow down. And the crew leaders, especially, will get on the radio and they will tell the race director, they'll call that team and let them know, "Hey, heads up because next time could be a penalty." The biggest danger is something that's out of their control. 'Cause where there's been a crash, you've probably got oil, you've probably got debris. So they could pop a tire when you're loaded into a turn and you're working in that turn. During a race in Kentucky, a tire blew on driver Danica Patrick's car that sent her spinning, and narrowly missing a safety truck. I had no clue as to why she didn't hit anything. Talked to the guys, they just heard a pop. And they looked in the rear-view mirror and didn't see anything until she hit the side. Those are things that I guess, you've got no control over 'em. For the most part, though, the guys have been firefighters, and paramedics, rescue people all their life. There's a certain amount of risk that you're going to accept because that's what we've done all our lives. Unnecessary risk is unacceptable, but there's a risk there that we're willing to take, just to make sure these guys in those cars are okay. And what about another big risk the safety crew faces? Every now and then, we don't get a porta potty by our station. Sitting for hours in hot trucks, far away from the track facilities, there are certain needs that can't be ignored. You gotta go, you gotta go. We gotta stay hydrated, so part of staying hydrated is going. It's frustrating sometimes. But you gotta go, you gotta go. The safety crew could be called into action any time during a race. Is it possible that they could literally be caught with their pants down? Absolutely. You have to hustle on out. That's the bad part, is if you're caught going, you just gotta zip it up and go. For IndyCar, the concern for driver safety doesn't end when the cars leave the track. Safety is a year-round undertaking that involves research projects that extend through the off season. All of our data, of course, is in the database, and that gives us the accidents to go look at and drill in deeper when we do our research during the winter. IndyCar has been incredibly good about responding to need for safety improvements. Any time anybody's injured, the primary focus is, "Why did this happen? What would it take to lessen the forces below the threshold of human failure? When does a bone break? It's a bio-material and has a threshold. Got some elasticity, it'll bend a little bit before it breaks. We do sled testing. We do not use a real car. That would be too expensive. We have what we call a sled buck, which looks like a metal piping structure that simulates what a car and driver's seating area is. It allows us, quickly, to change foam materials, or any type of energy- resourceful materials. We have our own crash test dummy called The Thor. Our Thor dummy is more biofidelic. So he's got a little different neck, he's got quite a bit different spine and we can actually articulate him. Our IndyCar drivers sit at about a 45 degree angle. So the modifications we've made to him, we can articulate him into a cockpit seating area, just like one of our drivers. Some of the first tests we did, we properly broke him. He was made for the automotive world, which they typically test, we've all heard of bumper tests. 20Gs, 25Gs at the most. Our test pulse was a 70G pulse. When it hit, he ramped up out of the car and we promptly broke what is his clavicle. Because of the loading. The dummy had never seen a load like that. So it was easy for us to go in and modify it. We've had a series of crashes that have resulted in failure of the side of the tub. And it's a step-wise occurrence. You have a minor failure, the driver hits the side of the tub a little bit, and he's sore, out of breath. And the next step along the way is where you have a little bit more severe, where they break their pelvis, break a hip. Something in that nature. But each time there, you're getting a crash pulse you know how much force it takes to fracture the tub. Then you know how much more force it takes to fracture the driver. Then you have one where the driver's seriously injured and you've got a much higher force. But got a graph now, you got an array and you can say, "Well, this is the trend and this is where we're going." And now with three points, you can start speculating what the pulse graph would look like. We got a new chassis in 2012. We saw that as a reset point. We started looking at drivers and injuries prior to the 2012 car. Every one of them, to a tee, it didn't matter how tall or short they were, had seats that were very thin. They all felt like they wanted to sit on the floor of the car They'd want to sit right on the carbon fiber on the floor of the car. So a driver's seat, typically, would have zero foam under their butt. And it takes a certain amount of energy for our average 160-pound driver to absorb that. With the advent of our 2012 car, we were actually able to put foam in the car before the driver ever took his seat. So we now have a three-inch piece of EPP foam behind their back, and we have 1.2 inches under their butt. And that's one of the things that have made this car so safe when it comes to accidents. Can we evolve a car that has better driver protection than what we have now? We'll always be able to do that. There'll always be something that you can do better. But you don't know that when you're do it until they figure out another way to crash it. The thing that I just really don't like to hear at a racetrack is, "That'll never happen." Because I can guarantee you, it will. It just hasn't happened yet. If you can think of it, it's gonna happen. We had a big road course headrest change we did two years ago. There was an accident in Baltimore, involving Scott Dixon and Will Power. It was a really small accident. It was on a restart, I believe. We had heard from Scott the week after, that he had a pretty good headache from that. It was only like a 10G, 10-15G hit. We don't typically raise our eyebrows anymore unless it's a 50G and above hit. Thankfully. So, we looked at this headrest and from the in-car camera and stuff and what Scott went through, and what ended up happening. He had severe vibration. So when you look at the in-car his head rattled back and forth between the headrest. And what we found out, talking to the drivers after this is that a lot of the street course, it was just rough. Their heads banging around, they were having headaches and stuff after the race. It was due to the EPP foam that was there. It was doing its job on big impacts, the 50G impacts. But all of a sudden, we had a new data point, where it wasn't working at the low-G impact. We were able to take the crash box data, go up to the crash sled that we use up in Westfield, and we were actually able to duplicate exactly what Scott's head went through on the sled. We were able to run all these materials on the headrest and we took over 40Gs of that impact level out of that type of accident. Knock on wood, we've pretty much eliminated that now. And that all came from an accident analysis, turned it to the sled, proofed the information and proofed the materials. In a true impact situation, our headrest does all the work. We always say, "We're trying to put ourselves out of business." The day we quit hurting drivers, we're done. We've got a focus, we know what our target is, and we've got good research money to do it, we've been able to do it over the years. My third question when I woke up in ICU was, "When can I get back in a car?" Here I am, laying in hospital, can't speak, five machines hooked up to me. Barely made it through the last 24 hours, and my third question was, "When can I get back into the machine that put me here?" I had moments over the next couple of months whether I thought I'd be able to. But never once did I ever waver on whether or not I wanted to. After suffering severe injuries, in an accident during Indianapolis 500 practice, James Hinchcliffe recovered during the remainder of the IndyCar season and returned to racing the following year. You've got this balance, right, you know, you're a competitor, and you're like, "No matter what I'm gonna get back." But there's always that five percent in your brain that's like, "Yeah, but what if that never happens again? What if you can't do this ever again?" And that was like terrifying. And I don't know if that adds more motivation to get better or what, but there were definitely times where standing in the shower, and I can't even, like, lift my head up 'cause my neck's in so much pain it's stuck in this position. I'm like, "Well, you can't drive a race car doing this." And so, there were definitely days where it was just really a challenge to kind of accept where I was and understand where I was going. James' real victory came one year after his accident when he returned to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway to become the fastest car on track, and take the pole position for the 100th running of the Indianapolis 500. I came into this month really hoping that we'd have a new story to talk about, after what happened last year, and I think we did it. I can't believe it. I'm honestly, I'm kind of at a loss for words. Which as you know is rare for me. We're very lucky as IndyCar drivers to know that we have that safety team at all races. There's no other series on earth that operates with that kind of program. And all these people have massive amounts of experience. Not only in medical, in EMT, things like that, but at the racetrack, doing this particular job. I mean, they're all very seasoned, very experienced. And there's no doubt that that played a huge part in what got me out of that car in one piece, still breathing. I don't think there was anything they could've done differently or better or anything. I think that group performed at the absolute highest level that anybody could have in that situation. And I'm here as a result of that. I think everybody involved in the extrication and everything, from the moment I hit to the moment I get to the hospital they have to be really pleased with themselves. Not that they would say that, you know. Because they're not like that. But it was incredible what they were able to accomplish in that moment. It's not an individual pride. It's the pride that our system is put together that allows these results to happen. You know, when a driver's seriously injured, and we can have an effect on that outcome, that's what it's all about, really. They're all invaluable members of the safety team, but our IndyCar team as a family. You know, to be able to look after each other like that. We're the luckiest drivers on earth to be able to have that traveling with us everywhere we go.
