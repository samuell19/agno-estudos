Venkat, get me the mic. Hello. Hello. Bro, arrange VIP chairs in the first two rows. Rest of them will have normal ones, okay? Phani! Vehicles are coming in, man. Ask them to move out. There's no space here. All right. We'll take care of it. 'This fest must happen no matter what.' 'There shouldn't be any trouble.' Yuva. We must stop this fest at any cost. It's a matter of pride for us. You're done. Take a look. Tell me if you don't like it. I don't want you whining later. It's all right. But, do you think this fest will happen? Are you sure there will be no havoc? Why are you pacing, looking all nervous? Are you waiting for someone? May I come in, sir? Please come, Revanth. What brings you here? Sir, other colleges have moved ahead with their fests. We thought it's a good time to have our own. Students also seem pretty interested, sir. I know. I know about it pretty well. But after that fight at the last fest... Our Chairman is voting against it. Sir, you can't lose hope yet. You have to talk to the Chairman and convince him. We'll make sure there's no chaos this time. Yes, sir. Ask him, guys. Please, sir. Please do it. All right. I'll try talking to him. They won't win the series. I won't have a free bowel movement. Why is he calling so early? What is it, Principal? It's about the college fest, sir. Did you forget the ruckus that happened last year? Why do you want to revisit that? Sit in your office and work in peace. Just because we slipped in the bathroom once... We don't quit going to the bathroom, do we? Whoa! You might have to think hard to give quotations. But a few drinks will do the deed for me. It's not like that, sir. There's this guy in our college called Revanth. He's a really good guy. He's organizing the whole event this time. He'll make sure there's no trouble. I assure you. Wow! I can feel some bowel movement. It's a good sign. All right, man. You managed to convince me. But if anything goes wrong at the fest... You have to cancel it right away. Okay? Sure, sir. I'm going to have to go now. Bye. Thank god! He finally agreed, boys. Go ahead with your arrangements. Thank you, sir. But there's one thing. If anything goes haywire at the fest... He wants me to cancel it right away. No problem, sir. We won't let it get to that. Hmm. Very good. So, have you thought of a name for the fest? We haven't thought of anything yet, sir. Why don't you suggest a catchy name? Catchy name, huh? Right. Only the youth of today can offer something new to the world. And when you discover such a thing, that excitement is boundless. You have to taste that high at least once in your life. So, let's call this fest... 'EUREKA!' JAVA. JAVA is an objective orientated programming language. It has a similar concept to inheritance. What's inheritance, sir? Good question. Who does your grandpa's wealth go to? My dad. What about your dad's wealth? It goes to me. That's what you call inheritance. Sit down. Sir, notice. I wonder what it is this time. Fest has been announced. You have activates related to sports, culture, technology, blah, blah, blah. The fest will begin in 10 days. Guys! Where are you going? Where are you going? No more classes once the fest has begun, sir. We can get back later. Guys, I stayed up all night to prepare. Let me finish this one class at least. Please! Let's wear sarees to this fest. Yeah. I'm damn bored of denims. You're right. Bro, let's perform a theatre play at the fest. We'll rock. I have to woo a girl at least in this fest, man. Go ahead. All the best, dude. I'll give a presentation on robotics this time. You're a classical dancer, right? Why don't you do a piece? Okay, sister. What's up, dude? You're giving quite the feels with your chest out like that. What's happening? I'm the Don of the college when Yuva isn't around. Look how peaceful it is under my watch. You're not the Don, man. You're the apprentice. Don't get your hopes up. Blackie! Hey! Come here. Me? Didn't you know freshers shouldn't wear denims? I wasn't told, bro. I can't believe our juniors are so dumb. They can't even rag properly. I'll show you how it's done. Can't wait. Take your pants off. Bro?! Take your pants off! Take them off! What's with the boxers? They're so comfortable. Really? Such a show off. All right. You should go around in boxers till the fest ends. You'll feel damn comfortable. How was that? How can I wear boxers in college, bro? Look, bro. This is how ragging is done. And you have to do as we say. If I find out that you disobeyed me... I'll be hurt. I'll rip your skin off next. Now get lost! Okay, bro. Get going! He looked so funny in those boxers. Jahnavi, you handle the help desk. Okay. You're in charge of sports. You take techno events. You look after the cultural activities. I'll supervise the management on the whole, okay? Okay. Our fest should be a 10-day celebration. But no one is allowed to break the rules. Eureka? I think I've heard that name before. Ah! It's from that song 'Eureka-Saka-Mika'. 'We've been fooled' 'He has become the hero' 'He gave the name zero to our guy' 'Eureka-Saka-Mika' Shut up, man! Such a nuisance. Hey, you manage sports. You arrange the cultural events. You be at the help desk. What happened, man? You're late to the party. Those guys are distributing the fest work. What the hell are we supposed to do? We're nothing less. We're also going to distribute the work. Hey, you get the drinks. You get the soda. You get the snacks. I'll check out the chicks. Don't make me break your jaw. Don't hold back. Ask for drinks again and I'll break your jaw. We have to do something, Yuva. Idiots! Wasting all my time. What happened, Mr. Adi Narayana? What else? This bloody fest is such a waste of time. We have a lot of syllabus to cover. You know there's little time during the semesters. I'm an M. Tech gold medalist. I wanted to train at least 10 students like me. Cool down, sir. It's just 10 days. We'll get to rest as well. Stop it, sir. I can't even eat anything if I don't work for my salary. Good morning, sir. Good morning. Are they your only students? Don't you consider us the same? Give us something to do. We'll contribute as well. You might be brave enough to smoke in front of the Principal. But I'm not brave enough to trust you with the fest. You want something to do, right? Make sure you don't get in their way. That's your only job. Take a breath mint for God's sake. Good morning, everyone! Welcome to Eureka! The fest we've all been waiting for is here. Reach out to me if you need any updates regarding the events. This is Jahnavi. Thank you. So you've finally managed to start the fest. Wait and watch. I'll finish it too. The Chairman needs to go for giving you permission in the first place. Get me some water. Lakshmi, water! Come fast. Someone must be missing me. Who else would it be? Madam, of course. You're saying she's missing me from heaven? Who knows? Maybe they have that facility too. Oh, yeah? Let me know when you go up there. First fill me in on tomorrow's programme. Okay, sir. First... Tell me about the important ones first. We'll get to my pastimes later. Okay, sir. First you have a meeting with the Minister. Then you have project discussion over lunch with Industrialist Jaganmohan Rao. Then you have the new venture planning at the real state office. When you're done with these, if you still have time to spare... There's an India Vs England cricket match. Just a pastime. Yes, sir? Why did you hit me, sir? Because you left out the important matter... And decided to tell me the pastimes first. Schedule the other programs in sync with the cricket match. What did you learn from this? Cricket is more important, sir. Intelligent! Thank you. Go away. Did you call the catering? I did. They'll get back to us with the quotation. Hey, guys. Why do you have that strange look on your faces? I'm the Event Organizer. Nau! But on the phone you said you were Nausheen. Yeah. It's Nau for short. By the way, who's Rev? Rev? Sounds like some rave party. It's short for Revanth, man. I think she likes everything short. Shut up. I'm Revanth. Hi, Revanth. Hi. From sports to stage decoration... From event hosting to food menu... I'll take care of everything. You don't worry. So we don't have to bang our heads anymore. But we want the event to rock. We didn't expect you to do such a good job with the event. All the arrangements are crazy, Revanth. You stood strong no matter how many troubles they created. Didn't you get angry with them? Let the fest end. I'll pay them back. We should teach him a lesson before the fest ends. Guys, Revanth is stealing the spotlight in front of the girls. It's not too late, Yuva. Guests are yet to arrive. Say the word. We'll get drunk and bring the whole thing down. Cheers! Are you crazy? Why would you put the glass down after saying cheers? My gym coach told me that alcohol shrinks muscles. Like you have any muscle on you. By the way, I have a doubt. Go ahead. Why do we say cheers before drinking? Because... I mean... It's an age-old tradition. We should follow it without questioning it like fools. Shut up! People don't follow traditions for nothing. There's a reason behind everything. Oh, really? Tell me what the reason is. Listen up. Man has 5 senses. We read about in school. We can see alcohol with our eyes. Smell it with our nose. Feel it with our hands. Taste it with our tongue. But how will our ears know that we're drinking? We say cheers so that our ears get the message... And our body has a wholesome experience. It's the respect we give to alcohol. How can you not know about it? Cheers! He'd say anything if the other person is a fool. It's true, man. Google it if you want. I will. Bro, give me your hotspot. Get lost! You don't even have Internet and you were skeptical about me. Bro, you guys are here? I've looked all over the college for you. It's definitely something silly if Bhaskar rushed here. What's the matter, Silly Bhaskar? Bro, there's a new chick in college. Wow! She's so hot! Stop exaggerating, man. I can't listen anymore. He called some chick smoking hot last time. But she looked like Sathi's sister. It's not like every other time, bro. This one's definitely smoking hot. She's from CSC? Uh-huh. IT? Bah! She's not even a student. Now you have a thing for lecturers? Cheap! No, bro. She's here as the Event Organizer for that fest. Organizer to an event that will never happen? Let's see what she can do. I want to host a fashion show with your students. Fashion show? You think our guys can do it? I'm here. I'll train them. Why is your college painted in crazy colors? Oh, that? Our Chairman is a cricket fanatic. So that block has Team India's color. What about the orange one? Sunrisers! Nice! Umm... What are your plans this evening? Nothing. I thought we could get dinner together. Ah, I got to go. We'll plan some other time. Okay? Bye. Hello. I'm coming. Damn! What's your name? Harika, sir. Couldn't you find any other college? Why, sir? Is it no good? Of course, it's good. Any college is good in the first year. Hey, Yuva. You know our college rules already. You can only rag students in your branch. Who said anything about ragging? Hey, girl. Was I ragging you? Uh-huh. Look. Tell me this. There are many girls in your branch, considering its CSC. What about us? How do you expect us to have fun with guys? I don't care. There's no way you're messing with our branch girls. You guys don't get it. There was no reason for you to make a big deal out of this. Now my ego will take over. Hey, girl. Give me that. I'm taking her scarf. I dare you CSC guys to take it from me. Varun, how did your brother's wedding go? It went great. You ditched us but you should've been there, man. There were drinks, meat... He puked like a drunken monkey that night. Yeah, man. My body is still sore. Why? From puking? No, man. We danced our lives away on the floor. Yeah, man. The DJ was crazy. He played some popping tracks. Really? What all did he play? You know that... You wait. Got it. [singing folklore] What are the nerds doing here? Give me the scarf back. Scarf? Okay. I dared you to take it from me. I didn't mean beg. Hey! I know you want to fight me. And we definitely will. Wait until the fest. You can have your wish. Tell him, guys. If the fest happens, it's his win. Why would I wish for that? No way! Man, you're taking advantage of my weakness. As if I'm going to piss my pants otherwise. Hey! What's up, Hunk? You think you're going to hit us? They must be looting all the fest money. Their bodies look huge and solid. Hey! What the hell! Yuva! Give me the scarf. Hey! You go. Revanth, you guys also leave. Yuva, why are you doing this? You're a good guy. Drop all of this. You're the only one in this college who thinks I'm a good guy. Let me hear it from one other person. I'll drop everything. You need to learn C language to do any kind of programming. Got it? Good. Sincere boy! Why are you taking a class now, sir? On top of that, there's only one student. It doesn't matter how many students are in the class. What matters is if that one student is focusing or not. I don't think he's focusing, sir. Looks like he's crying from all the torture. Silly fellow! He's not crying. They're happy tears from witnessing my desperation for his bright future. Hey! There are many events going on outside. Why are you here, listening to class? I'm not here on consent, bro. Sir is holding me against my will. Sir! This is too much. You go out. Thanks, bro. Hey! Class is not over yet. This is not done, sir. Strictly no classes till the fest ends. We have the Chairman permission. I'll have to complain on you if you repeat this. You decide what to do. Disturbance of India! Idiot! Going in blindly with 100 bucks. Going in cautiously with 200 bucks. Oh my god! What now, sir? I'll kill him. Kill whom, sir? Who else? Revanth, of course. He came and interrupted my class. He doesn't study. Doesn't let other study either. Useless fellow! Violence doesn't suit you, sir. Play cards with us. Why? So that I lose all my money to you. [indistinct chatter] Who the hell invented alcohol, man? Hey, bro. Hangover? Yeah. It's killing me. I'll quit drinking from today. That's what everyone says on the day of a hangover. Oh, yeah? Well, you're a rare sight in college. What's up? We have a small problem, bro. What is it? We've been suspended for a week. They want us to get our parents. Please come and talk on our behalf. Please come, bro. All right. Let's go. Hello, Mr. Krishna Murthy. Yes? They told me that you suspended them. Yeah. So what? Students are bound to make mistakes, sir. You should get some sense into them. You can't suspend them and call their parents. Why are you getting involved? I'm going to talk to their parents only. Their parents aren't coming. What's your name? Rajesh. I'm Rajesh's brother. Now speak. Do you even know what he did? Why do I care? If you don't let this go, I'd have to dig into you. Choose wisely. All right. Go. Okay. Thank you. Let's go, guys. Why'd you let them go, sir? You saw what happened. Did I have a choice? He's only here to make my job tougher. What about my complaint letter? What were you doing with a fresher? What did he ask you? He asked me to write his record, sir. You could ask her that in the library or the classroom. What were you doing in the bushes, damn it? You're a disgrace to the college. Hey! If you say he's a disgrace to the college, I say I support him. Will you raise your hand on someone with my support? Huh? Hey! What's your problem, man? You want to do the college fest. Is that it? Come. Come. You can do it. You want to do the fest all by yourself. But I don't want the fest at all. Why? Why? This is my weakness. He's provoking you on purpose. If you fight him, it will be the end of our fest. Let's leave. Come! Sushma, let's go. Thanks, bro. Yuva is being so nosey. He's looking for an excuse to fight us. Try talking to the Principal about him. At least we'll have done our part. He's creating so much trouble in college. Wonder what he'll do when we're outside campus. Karim is waiting for you. Hmm. 10 wrestlers came to our colony to beat me yo yesterday. I was all alone. But I didn't fear them. I beat the crap out of every single one of them. They're admitted in the hospital now. Wow! Looks like a villain's den from the 90s. Hello, boss. Are they here? Please come. Damn! Did he drink all those beers? What capacity, man! Shut up and walk. Boss, here they are. Hello, boss. Hmm. Leave! Don't embarrass me. I said leave! He drank 12 beers? I'm begging you. Please go. Chotu, get me another strong beer. Strong beer or light beer? One strong beer! You blackie! 'He looks like a drug addict.' 'No wonder he'd want beer.' So, what is this about, bro? I've heard a lot about you. We'd work great together. Will you do something for me? What is it? Cocaine. Many students in the city are using now. If you start this business in your college as well... We'll make a lot of money. What do you say? You said you've heard a lot about me, right? But you've missed a detail. Let me clarify. I'm upset with that college. Only upset! But if you try to mess with the students, I won't take it. Drugs, betting and gambling... Never come to me with this stuff again. No. No. Don't get nervous. Walk with confidence, okay? You should carry your own attitude. Go. Go! Hey! They'll feel uncomfortable if you keep staring like that. Can you please go? Come on! You're in our college, doing our college event. Why don't I get to see them? Watch them on the dais then. This is not the place. It's my wish. I'll look whenever I want. Wherever I want. You're crossing your limits. Wait. I'm calling Revanth. Oh, yeah? Like that will scare me. Go ahead! What are you doing here with the girls, man? Let's go and have toddy. Really? Bro, so are we going to a toddy shop or directly the palm trees? Whatever, man. Be happy that I'm sponsoring you. Whoa! Where are you going? The mango garden? Nah! Change in menu. We're going to the palm trees. Shut up, man! Why are you always smoking and drinking with these losers? You guys are only spoiling him. We are? Hmm. We're still amateurs when it comes to drinking. But our bro here is a scholar. Enough with the compliments, man. Look how swollen your face is from all the drinking. Really? Nah. It's just the beard. I look fine. You look good, bro. Don't mind her. Let's go. We have nice events going on. No! Listen to me! They're boring. Save some toddy for me, dude. Don't finish it. Sure, bro. We'll drink it all. Today's event is called J-A-M. JAM! Just-A-Minute! We'll give you a topic. You'll have to speak about it for 1 minute nonstop. Whoever speaks confidently... Let me go, Jaanu. Shh! Bah! I want to go. Be quiet. Get up. So our first participant is Rahul from EEE. What's so interesting about this? What's your problem? Watch. It will be good. What is that rowdy doing here? Who? That guy. Why are you torturing me? Why do we care? Let's focus on the event. I need to smoke. Just shut up. Sit. [singing randomly] Now watch. Stop! So our next participant is Yuva from final year Mechanical. Yuva! Yuva! You got called on stage. No way! It's you! Stop kidding, Jaanu. Why would she call me? Go! Let me rest. Yuva! What are you looking at? Look straight! Never mind. You can leave if you can't speak. Greetings, everyone! The impact of today's technology is immeasurable. We use technology everywhere. Every time. [dialogues muted by music] These are all the advantages and disadvantages of today's technology. Yeah. That's it. Thank you. Super! Do you need any information? Yes. But not in concern with the fest. Then? It's about Yuva sir. Yuva? Hmm. What do you want to know? The entire college sees Yuva sir as a rowdy. But he spoke really well yesterday. I didn't expect that at all. I'm totally confused. I'm curious to know Yuva better. Yeah. He's not a rowdy like the whole college assumes. He was the college topper in the first year. Because he was seated next to the window during final exams... Everyone threw the slips at him just before the squad walked in. He tried his best explaining himself. But the squad still annulled his exams. When the college topper was faced with such a tragedy... He became really disturbed. Just because of a small incident? It looks simple to outsiders. But I've known him since we were kids. He never came second in any of the exams. When he had to appear for a re-exam for the first time... He felt greatly insulted. I tried really hard to get him back to normal. But he's not listening. You see, he's stubborn. Yuva is creating a lot of trouble, sir. He's getting in our way all the time. You have to take an action on him. Look. Whatever action I take must bring a change in the student. Not spoil the student's career. Be patient till the fest ends. You know Commissioner and MLA are our Chief Guests. We can deal with him later. Eat. Hey! What is this? Beer. You could've lied to me that it's a soft drink. You didn't have to be so direct. You expect me to get scared of you and tell the truth? What the hell! Do you realize who you're speaking with? Even I can get medals if I pay them money. Hey! You're crossing your limits. What's with the shirt? Is that what you wear to college? It's trending now, sir. Looks more like you burnt the holes yourself with a cigarette. Stop it, sir. You might be jobless. But I've got a lot to do. See you. I'm jobless? Damn it! What happened this time, sir? I'll kill him. You mean Revanth? No. Yuva. He bruised my ego. If you keep killing everyone, there will be nobody left in the college. Let them die, sir. I ask them to stay up all night and pass their exams. But they get knocked out after a few drinks and piss their beds. How are they useful to the country, sir? That doesn't mean you kill one student every day. What are you playing right now? Rummy. What did you play yesterday? 3 cards. You can play a different game every day. But I can't kill a different guy each day, huh? If we say any more, he might want to kill us both. Let's carry on with our game. Show the next card. I heard you complained on our guys about ragging you. Take her number, man. Give me your number. I said give me your number! Hey! What are you guys doing there? We're ragging her, bro. Why do you say it like it's something to be proud of? But you got out suspension cancelled and encouraged us. You got suspended for ragging? Yes! Wait right there. I'm coming. Dude, run! I'll break your bones if you rag anyone again. Come here. Are you a fresher? Yes, sir. Which branch? Computer Science. As expected. Were you giving them your number? Yes, sir. They only asked for it. Do you know what happens if you give your number to everyone who asks for it? I do, sir. That is why I was giving them my dad's number. Whoa! So, you're going to give me your dad's number? What, sir? Nothing. If you ask, I'll give you my number only. All right. Go to class. He wanted my number, right? She was going to give you her number? Hmm. Were you drunk then? I just had one beer, man. That's it. If I'm honest, you've lost all your stamina. Stop it, guys. So, did you take her number or not? I didn't. Damn! Hey! Why are you feeling so bad? Go hang out with your CSC batch. I'll kill you! Jaanu might have opted for the CSC branch. But she's a part of our batch outside. I didn't ask for your opinion. Thanks, man. What? 'I bought drinks. Send her back quickly.' 'Let's get drunk and pass out.' Idea! Hey, give me your dad's number. What for? Do you know what the time is? Quarter to eleven and his daughter is still roaming outside. I'll ask your dad if this is how he raised you. You don't have to call my dad to get drunk. I was leaving anyways. You get drunk or die for that matter. Hey, Jaanu! Wait! You're a sweetheart. Hey! What are you looking at? Let's get to business. So shameless! You should've at least offered her a drink. We don't have enough for ourselves. I can't give her a share. Pour quickly, man. It's been a few hours since I drank. Who the hell is it at this hour? It's some unknown number. Who is it? Hello. Who is it? It's me, sir. Shobita. Shobita? Yes, sir. The girl you asked for her number but didn't take it. So I thought I'd only call. Yeah, right. Dude, give us that. Tell me. What are you doing? What do guys do at this time? We're drinking. Really? Which brand? Mansion House. My favorite Balayya's brand. Hey! You also like Balayya. I don't just like him. I'm crazy for him. So where do you live? Miyapur. Really? I come there often. But I've never seen you around. You know the Sai Baba temple? Oh, the temple? I've never been there. You see, there's Durga Wines beside it. I'm a regular there. Dude! “I'm losing my mind for the first time because of you” “I've forgotten all about the world” “I feel like a little baby all over again, talking to you” “I'm desperate to crash in your lap” “I've never expected that I'd change to this extent” “I'm afloat in a colorful world with your presence” “What's happening?” “When have I come this far?” “I've followed your footsteps like a shadow” “What's happening?” “Looks like I've lost my way” “But it's lovely being here with you” “What's happening?” “I wonder how much time has passed” “I feel this mesmerized when I look at you” “What's happening?” “My heart is bouncing around in madness” “I wonder where my heart is” “I find it clinging onto you” “Maybe I'm day dreaming” We had a good time, right? Yeah. You spent the whole day with me. Don't you think your friends will mind? Take it easy. Friends, my foot! All right then. You go. I'll call you later. Why? Never mind. Go. I'll call you. Oh. Okay. Bye. Okay. Bye. What's wrong, guys? Why are you giving me that look? What's going on? You're in love with Shobita, aren't you? Nah. There's no love. How did you know anyways? Hit it in. Where are you going, man? Are you afraid you'll lose? Dude! Are you going to play or what? The hero and heroine in our sketch are so in love that... They ditch their friends and hang out together. But when the heroine is waiting for the hero... Hero's friend doesn't let him go. Do you know what the hero does? What does he do? He slaps his friend and rushes to the heroine. This scene doesn't exist in my sketch. “When I'm with you, time reaches a standstill” “When I'm with you. It feels like I've got wings to fly” “I spend all my time listening to your thoughts” “The world keeps murmuring about the two of us” “What's happening?” “I feel a tide within me” “My heart feels like an ocean” “What's happening?” “You've become my shore” “I see you spread your arms to me” “What's happening?” “It's like a new life all over again” “I feel like I'm reborn in this moment” “What's happening?” “You've become my heart beat” [singing randomly] Hey, guys. Where are you? Hey, look over there. I'm already in the college. Whoa! Give me 2000 bucks. I'll give you a great show. Hey! What is this? Why? Isn't it enough? I'll swipe my card for more. What the hell are you saying? Watch your words. Bastard! What the hell! Does Revanth pay more than this? Or does it feel that good with him? You should've seen Nausheen's face. Apologize to her. No. It's going to get bad. What the hell! Say sorry. Sorry. Thank you. “I wonder where my heart is” “I find it clinging onto you” “Maybe I'm day dreaming” “Can I call you mine?” “I can't stop taking your name” “I like it when I'm smiling to myself” “Taking this walk with you” “It's more than what my heart can wish for” “Believe me when I say I'm lost” “Your reflection in my heart is a testament” “What's happening?” “I see moonlight during the day” “I can feel the moon in front of me” “What's happening?” “It's like the Earth has touched the Sky” “You make this magic happen” “What's happening?” “I feel so intoxicated, I stand in my own way” “What's happening?” “I see you as my other half” What's wrong, Sathi? Why are you dull? I lost 2000 bucks in the cricket betting yesterday. Bah! You got lucky. You just lost 2000 bucks. Guys ruin their lives out there, you know. Listen to me and quit this. What is this, bro? I told you he hit me and you guys are talking about betting. He was right in doing so. Who would stay calm when you mess with his girlfriend? Be happy that it was him who hit you. If it were me, I would've dug your grave. Bastard! Yuva, people won't say he hit Silly Bhaskar. They'll say he beat up Yuva's gang. We should react to that at least. What do you want to do now? Let's send her out of this college, bro. Shut up! That girl has a brother. If we screw with him, it will mess with their heads. Brother! Shut up! Brother, what happened? I sent you out here to do an event, right? This is what you do instead? But what have I done? What have you done? Let's go home and I'll explain everything. Listen to me! Shut up! Brother! Get in! Come on. Come on. We have to win tomorrow's match at any cost. Play well, guys. Come on! What's wrong, man? Why do you look so low? Nausheen's brother came and took her away. How did that happen all of a sudden? I don't know, man. Someone told him bad things about us. Who else would it be other than Yuva? Hey! Not now. We'll deal with him after the fest. Damn! Who's going to host the event now? You know Shobita from first year, right? I watched her host one of the events recently. She did a really good job. What do you say? First, the guests will light the lamp. Followed by the classical dance. Then call me onto the dais. I'll speak. Go with this order. Come to me if you have any doubts. Hmm. Where's Silly Bhaskar? I don't see him. Revanth hit him, right? So he was drinking all night out of embarrassment. I guess he's still hung over. Hey! Where are you going? Volley ball, check. Basketball, check. Throw ball, check. Cricket? Who won the cricket match? Final match between CSC and Mechanical. CSC need 4 runs from 2 balls. Match just got really interesting. Let's see who'll win. Ugh! Yay! CSC! CSC! CSC! Hey, I've sent all the students in. There's not a single soul here to watch them celebrate. T That's great. Hey! Where are you going? Get inside! They're coming, guys. Hey! Why did you take your shirt off? It's a white shirt. I don't want any blood on it. 'But your pants are white too.' You broke the lock, bastards! Win the game if you're manly enough. Don't lock gates like a bunch of ladies. Why did you slap him, man? Don't spare them, guys. Even the lab assistant wants a software salary. How can I do that? Sir! Sir! Revanth and Yuva's gang got into a fight. They hit our security guards who tried to stop them. There they go again. Where's my bowel movement? It's here! Sir! Sir! You got a call. Not right now. It's urgent, sir. It's kind of urgent to me too. But it's the Principal. What's the matter, man? Hello. Sir... There's a fight going on in the college. I don't feel it anymore. This is why I clearly said no screw-ups this time. But you didn't listen. You assured me it would be fine. What were our guards doing? Security guards have already been knocked out, sir. All right. I'll talk to the SI. You hang up. Okay, sir. Ring him. Quick. What are you doing here? There's a big fight going on in college. What the hell! A fight? What are they doing here? I hope they didn't notice me. Hey! Damn, he did. Oi! Come here. What are you doing? I was putting stumps to play cricket, sir. Uh-huh. What's your name? Bhaskar, sir. You deserve an Oscar for acting. I'm not acting, sir. It's the truth. Where are the other players then? They were right here. They're over there. Move it. Bro, squeeze in, please. Hey. You weren't here when the fight started. How come you ended up here? When fate decides to play you, even God can't do anything, bro. Whatever. What's your name? Revanth, sir. Hometown? I'm a local. What about you? Phani from Guntur, sir. Siddhu from Karimnagar. You? Satish from Proddutooru. And you? Bhaskar, sir. I just told you. Hey! Stand back. Karan, sir. I'm a local. Varun from Bhuvanagiri, sir. Really? I'm also from Bhuvanagiri. Hey! Same village. Where in Bhuvanagiri, sir? Hey! Bhuvanagiri won't save you. Bastard! That was so unnecessary. Hey, body builder! You're from the local gym? Yes, sir. Change the coach or the gym itself. Okay, sir. What kind of a fight is this? Not a single guy is dripping blood. Back when we were students, we'd break each other's heads. Give us some time. We'll also break their heads. Who was that? You think you're students or rowdies? If you're so eager, let me know. I'll lock you up and show you hell. You're sent here to study. Not show off how heroic you are. You think you're heroes, eh? This is all good now. But once your career is ruined... No one can make things right again. Are you the gang's leader? Nothing like that, sir. Shut up. Hear me loud and clear. I'm going to be here till your fest ends. If you mess up again, I won't spare you again. I'll file a charge sheet on you guys. Security, whoever enters the college tomorrow... Cannot step outside until the fest is over. If anyone leaves, you guys are dead men. Got it? Yes, sir. Come fast, bro. The event is about to start. Want to fight, huh? Like you're Bahubali and he's Bhallala Dev. Get going, man. Get out of here. It's the influence of movies. Yes, sir. I didn't like you at first, Yuva. But I like you now. Don't let this feeling pass. Cops were here today. Understand how serious things just got. Jahnavi told me about your exams being annulled in the 2nd year. It's your fate. You can't blame anyone for it. Well said, Shobi. Very well said. But those exams aren't the reason I'm a changed man. When I was the topper in the 1st year, the whole college appreciated me. But when the squad caught me back then, there was nobody to support me. I still took it easy and showed up for the re-exams. Get up. Step out. Roll your sleeves down. Do you have any slips? No, sir? No? You must have some tucked in. You're a pro at this. That's why you guys wear shirts to exams. Look at him! Tell us how to cheat and be a topper. We'll become toppers too. What say, man? I'm in. Sir, you didn't give me the question paper. Sir, I'm talking to you! I'll give it. Why are you in a hurry? They studied hard for the exams, unlike you. Time is running out, sir. Why are you raising your voice, huh? Blame goes to your parents for raising such a son. If they hadn't done a bad job, you would've been good. Here you go. Did you get kicked out again? Everyone tagged me as a rowdy since then. They blamed me for every mishap in college. That is why I hate this college and the people in it. Everything good in this college looks bad to me. That doesn't mean you ruin your career. Who says I'm running my career? Do they have to teach me how to pass? I can teach myself. I can pass on my own. You're a smart student. You'll pass. What about your friends? What about those juniors who are inspired by you? They are not as smart as you. Remember one thing, Yuva. If your friends blame you for their careers in the future... Can you take it? You're a good guy, Yuva. 'You're the only one in this college who thinks I'm a good guy.' 'Let me hear it from one other person.' 'I'll drop everything.' I want to be happy with you. Let go of all the drama. You know what I mean, right? I'll be waiting for you at the fest tomorrow. Don't come as the Yuva who gets into fights. But as the Yuva who's willing to work with us. 'What about your friends?' 'What about those juniors who are inspired by you?' 'If your friends blame you for their careers in the future...' 'Can you take it?' 'I want to be happy with you.' 'Let go of all the drama.' Let's go. Hey, look at him. There's one guy like him in every event, always ready with a camera. Aditya... Tell me, blackie. Blackie, huh? I wanted to make you the DOP for my next short film. But looks like you're not as talented as I thought. Really? Please take a look at my work once. I don't have the patience, man. Please take a look, dude. First year girl. Second year girls. Bloody hell! He's wearing pants without my knowledge. Where the hell is Srinu? Get him, guys! Umm... Sir... What? Give Yuva some work to do. He'll help us. Why are you still trying to ruin this, Yuva? Everyone is happy. What's your problem? I'm not trying to ruin anything, sir. I really want to help you. Yes, sir. He won't cause any trouble. All right then. Student medals are in the office room cupboard. Go get them. Chairman is also here. Okay, sir. Thank you. Let's go. Dushshasana, go ahead. Please don't do it. Please. 'Draupadi's Undressing Act'? Yes, bro. Kauravas won. Pandavas lost. Draupadi was undressed and humiliated b Kauravas. That's history. We can't change it. But we're just playing a drama here. Let's make good win over evil and undress Duryodhana instead. It'll be nice. We can't do anything if we're helpless. But when we d have the chance, we must try and help the good side conquer. Practice that, okay? Sure, bro. 'I don't get what happened.' 'I don't know what to do right now.' I go out and tell everyone?' 'No.' 'They'll definitely accuse me of killing him.' 'Cops are canvassing the area.' 'Who must've killed him?' 'Security, whoever enters the college tomorrow...' 'Cannot step outside until the fest is over.' 'Whoever committed the murder cannot step out till the fest ends.' 'I can prove my innocence only if I find him.' Draupadi, pull his clothes off. No. No. Please. Give me that. Bah! How long, sir? This is torture. It's really suffocating, you know. I'll go rest in the staff room. Staff room is locked. Then I'll go to the office room. 'I've read all of them.' 'Let me look in this for new ones.' Why are you shirtless, sir? What were you doing in the office room? Oh, you were gymming, weren't you? Tell me the truth, sir. You're doing a muscle show at the event, right? Don't crack silly jokes when you don't know the situation. Go and get a spare shirt from my car. I'll be in the bathroom, crying. Did he just say that? Weird! You want to rest while everyone is at the fest? Idiot! You're such a fool. Why am I even getting nervous? I'll tell everyone I didn't commit the murder. 'I'll kill Revanth!' 'Holy shit!' Slip of tongue. No one knows I came to the office room. 'Why are you shirtless, sir?' It's just one guy. I can manage him. I'm going to the office room. You want to join me? I'm going to the office room. You want to join me? I'm going to the office room. You want to join me? Do you want to join me? There's no way out of this. My fingerprints are all over his dead body. I better go and surrender. Will they lock me up in Andaman or Tihar? Will they feed me biryani in jail? Wrong place. Why are you wearing pants? It's the fest, so... I'll slash you with my belt. Take them off! No, bro. Please. If you take them off, you'll at least have boxers on. But if you make me, you'll end up naked. Think about it. No, bro. I'll only take them off. Go ahead. We all decided on wearing sarees, right? Why did you ditch us? I can't carry a saree. Jahnavi... I've sent Yuva to get the medals. He's not back and the event is about to start. Can you go get them from the office room? Sure, sir. Make it quick. I'll see you guys. What are you performing on? Where are the medals? I totally forgot. I'll get them right now. No need, Jahnavi went to get them. Oh, she did? Jahnavi went to get them?! This is nothing, man. We would've totally rocked the event. Hold on a minute. I'll be right back. I'm dead! Sorry, Balaraju. Get up. 'Where did the dead body go?' The medals are not here. 'Who moved it?' 'Did someone else come here after me?' 'How did it get here?' When did you get here? Just now. What are you doing here anyway? Everyone's waiting downstairs for you. I'll get these. You go. Why are you rushing me? Come on! Thank god! Bah! Hold on, Yuva. Why is he sitting there when all these chairs are empty? He didn't go and sit there. He was placed there. What do you mean? He's dead! He's dead?! Yeah. How can he just die? What about her? Pass me some water. Thank god! She's alive. What's going on? What happened to him? Why did you have to kill him? Don't force me to smack you. Why would I kill him? Then? I only know as much as you guys do. It's just that I found out 15 minutes before you. Please tell us the truth at least now. Who else would kill him if not you? Don't be silly. Silly Bhaskar! Call him! Call him immediately. Hello, Bhaskar. Yeah, bro? Did you happen to come to the office room? I just came out of the operation room. Huh? What are you talking about? I got really drunk last night and fell into a manhole. Dirty fellow! You'll never change. Hang up. It's not him. Bah! Jaanu... Jaanu... Calm down. This isn't the time to pacify you. First we need to find out who committed this murder. But how? Go to Security and find out who left the place. Okay. Hey! Don't ask directly. They'll get suspicious. Use your talent. Done, bro. Jaanu, let's get out of here. [announcement over mic] You go. Yeah. What were you two doing in there? Then? You two stepped out at once. And you're both sweating. Hey! You got the wrong idea. It's totally something else. Right. I can see that. Damn! Why did you change your shirt? Oh, that? It's got blood on it. What?! I meant it got sweaty. Shit! It's not like that. Don't say another word. My friend always told me not to trust you. But I was a fool. Just... Goodbye! At least listen to me! What did I get myself into? Like I don't have enough problems already. Wait. I'm coming. What's up, sir? You look fresh. I guess the office room did you good. Right. It did me a lot of good. You also go. Don't be shy. Go. It's okay. No, thanks. It's good. No. He should've gone. He would've peed his pants. “You can't hold air behind a line” “You can't mask shadow with a cloth” “You can't make the truth fade away” “Someone else has committed the crime” “The proof is well concealed” “Don't stop your quest for evidence” “Should I explore every possibility?” “Should I turn the Earth and Sky upside down?” “Should I smell the enemy even when a leaf flutters?” “Darkness is my biggest trap now” “I wonder when dawn will arrive” “I'm faced with all these questions today” “I will crack all the mysteries at any cost” “O' daughter of the mountain, who makes the whole earth rejoice, praised by Nandin” “Dwelling on the peak of the great Vindhya Mountain, praised by those desirous of victory” “O' Goddess, consort of the blue necked Shiva, one who has many families” “Be victorious, O' destroyer of demon Mahisha, with beautiful hair locks, the daughter of Mountain Himalaya” Thanks for coming on such short notice, sir. Come on, sir. How can I decline your invite? You're a powerhouse in the society. On top of that, you're a successful businessman. You know something? Sir... I always tell my son to seek inspiration from you. Oh! But he's always watching cricket. Is it? Only losers watch cricket in my opinion. Waste fellows! Thanks for coming on such short notice, sir. No formalities, sir. Of course. By the way, do you have the party fund for the coming by-elections? We're on it. It will be arranged by tomorrow. Organizer of today's fest... Mr. Revanth from final year, CSC! Please come on to the dais. Revanth?! Mr. Revanth from final year, CSC... Please come on to the dais. [indistinct murmur] Umm... Okay. Looks like Mr. Revanth is caught up with something. Moving on to the next item... Sushma is going to dance for us. Let's welcome her. Where's Revanth? Why are you asking me? You only did something to him. Tell me what you've done! What the hell are you saying? Hey! Break it. Stop this nuisance. Do you realize what you're doing? Don't you have some common sense? Don't embarrass me in front of the guests. Sir, he... Enough! Get out of here. Go! Let's go, guys. Idiots, I say. Hey, what happened? I somehow find the Principal suspicious, man. Are you out of your mind? Why would you even suspect him? So what if you noticed blood? Hey! I had bread-jam this morning. And you? Huh? Hey! You can find blood anywhere and everywhere. How can you be sure that it's Revanth's? You're right. But we don't even know where to look yet. I had a small suspicion. Let's lead from there. Let's see if we can connect more dots. I don't know, man. Do whatever you want. Look at the pictures, sir. There's you and the Chairman. I'll check later. Okay, sir. It's done. There's nothing to worry about. It's in the office room cupboard. Someone might get suspicious if you keep calling. Hang up! What now? I'm sure it's the Principal. I'll go tell everyone. Hey! Relax. You think everyone's going to believe you? Principal is like the most sincere person we've met. And Revanth was his favorite student. I have an idea. I'll go to the office room and look for evidence against the Principal. You handle the situation here. Hey! Be careful. Didn't I already tell you not to trust him? I thought he was a good guy. He's coming this way. Let him come. I'm not going to be convinced no matter what he says. Hmm. Don't melt down. Hail, Balayya! I don't want to hear anything, Yuva. Why did you change your shirt, Mr. Adi Narayana? Actually... Someone's calling you. Me? Yes, you. Who is it? Look. Over there. Thank god! Yeah, you did change your shirt. I didn't notice at all. 'This isn't some International crisis to ponder over.' Me? I'm coming. Many politicians in the world change parties. People change their word. After all, I changed my shirt. Everyone has got to act skeptical. What? Do you even love me? Why do you say that? You're supposed to convince your girlfriend when she's upset. Not pace around the venue like something's up. Situation is somewhat critical. Please try to understand. No. You only understand me. What do you want me to do now? Pamper me because I'm upset now. That's it? I'll pamper you tomorrow. I won't be upset tomorrow. Then I'll see you day after tomorrow. Dude! Did you find any clue? Guys, I need to tell you something important. We'll talk later, man. No. I have to tell you right now. It's really important. Don't you get it? Wait. Speak. Err... Revanth is dead. Why do you look so shocked? You only killed him brutally because you hate him. Your shirt also got blood on it. That is why you changed it. Hey! What are you talking about? How's my storyline? You were narrating your storyline? Yes. You asked me to get creative, remember? That is why I used all my brains. What do you think? Tell us the truth. Did you go to the office room tonight? No. Why? Nothing. I was just confirming. Well, tell me how the story is. If we upload this on YouTube, we'll have 2 million views to say the least. Tell me, guys. Let's go, man. Keep watching. I'll also make a path breaking film like Rajamouli some day. Now tell me what happened. It's not the Principal. How can you tell? Revanth, where are you? So you think it's not the Principal because he called Revanth. Am I right? Hmm. There could be another explanation. Principal could've murdered him and then called his cell to avoid suspicion. Maybe. But we can't reach a conclusion until we find another clue. Kanna Babu, there's a star missing. It must've dropped somewhere, sir. Aren't you ashamed to say that? If you lose your own stuff, how will you protect people's stuff? But people don't have stars, sir. Stop kidding and cover your uniform. It's a disgrace to the department if someone notices it. Okay, sir. Where's my star, man? Wow! You're a true student. There's a fest going on and you're out here studying. I'm really proud of you. Studying? My foot! I'm writing a story. Story? What story? I'll tell you. Revanth is dead, sir. We don't know who killed him, but... The murderer got blood onto his shirt. So he changed into a different shirt. Sir, looks like you also changed your shirt. I didn't... Hey! There's a fest going on and you're out here writing stories? Go there! Useless fellow! Damn it! No one encourages talent. I'll be a director one day. You'll see. Did he narrate a story or the reality? Oh my god! Hey! Come here. I'm talking to you. Come here. Me? What's with the underwear? It's not underwear, sir. Boxers. Whatever. Why are you half naked? Seniors punishment, sir. Seniors asked you to do this? Yes, sir. Will you do whatever people say? I'll ask you to roam around naked. Will you? No, sir. Go and put on your pants. Okay. Hey, stop! What are those? Parrots, sir. Be careful. They might bite into the guava. Why is the SI coming this way? He must've found out. Arrest me. 'I hope no one noticed.' It's in the office room cupboard. Be careful. It's the MLA? What happened, man? That's a bad sign. I'll come by later. What? You came back because a lizard fell on you? Useless fellow! If you miss it next time, you'll be fired. Go! Sir, you dropped your phone back there. So, do you think the MLA and SI are in it together? What would be their motive to kill him? I don't know, man. I'm so confused. Me too. Guys! I know who committed this murder. Who is it? Our Chairman. Chairman?! Yes. You idiot! Sir. Instead of following me around, why don't you keep an eye on the office room? You know how important that cupboard is to us. If it's revealed, my life will be totally screwed. Okay, sir. So you don't care about my life? Let's go. Is it the MLA, SI, Principal or the Chairman? Who killed him? One guy asks why I changed my shirt. Other guy narrates his short film story. They're making me so nervous. What do I do? Who is he? Why is he running away from me? He doesn't look like he's from this college. Did he commit the murder? I can save myself if I catch him. Hey What the hell! Who is he? Why is he following me? He came this way. Where did he disappear? Where's Revanth? I can't find him anywhere. I saw him go towards the office room a while back. Okay. Let's go look. Why is he here? What is he doing here? What, sir? I just checked. Revanth isn't in the office room. Where did he go then? Where could he be? Call him once. This is strange. His phone is switched off. Switched off?! Damn! 'Dead body has been moved.' 'Someone has been to the office room earlier.' 'Something is going on.' 'But I don't get it.' 'What could it be?' 'I can't find out what happened.' 'But I can figure out what's going to happen...' 'I can come out of this.' Damn! It's switched off. Could he have recorded the video? What is he doing on stage? EUREKA! The excitement of having discovered something new is amazing. We're feeling the same excitement now. Are you guys ready to discover that new thing? Yes! 'My story has reached its climax.' 'I guess he's going to expose me.' Ready? One! One! Two! Two! Three! Three! But I'm not going to reveal it to you. I know you've been eagerly waiting for him. Revanth will come and tell you himself. [indistinct murmur] So, put your fingers crossed for some more time. What kind of a twist is this? Revanth?! I insisted on not doing these college events. But you didn't listen to me. Now look. I had to hide from everyone and drink my beer. My life officially sucks. Yuva... You said Revanth would come and announce something. What is it? I don't know, sir. He saw something in the office room. Maybe it's about that. Even I'm not sure. In the office room?! Oh my god! Come on. Okay, sir. Sir, why are you hiding so much money in college? It's not hard earned money to save it at home. It's the black money I made through cricket betting. Oh! No one would even suspect that the money is here. You're right, sir. Put it in. That's right. I also received information about an IT raid on my house. Thank god! Let's go. Where's the bag? What are you looking for, sir? I put some important files in a bag and left it here. I can't find it now. Is it the red color bag? Yes. Did you see it? Yes, sir. Revanth just took it. Which way did he go? This way, sir. Hurry up. Which way? This way, sir. Come on. Do you know what Revanth is going to talk about? No, sir. But he said it has something to do with the office room. Office room?! Yes. I've sent the picture on Whatsapp. Look. Total 10 kilos of cocaine. I told you I hid it in here. Why do you still keep calling? If you don't trust me, don't do business with me. Do you know what all I'm risking here? Don't keep calling me. I'll wait for the right time and bring this stuff outside. Holy crap! Revanth, you got to me. What happened, sir? Any problem? Yuva, I need your help. Revanth stole a carton of mine. You have to find him at any cost. I wouldn't even mind if you break his legs. I'll give you all the money you want. I don't want money for hitting Revanth, sir. You have all my support. Let's go catch him. He must have gone that way, sir. Hurry up! There he is, sir. Catch him. Where did he go? Sir, Revanth is over there. Come on. There he is, sir. He's running away. Catch him! Catch him! We're losing him, sir. Grab this. Take this, sir. Throw it, sir. He's going away. Throw it, sir. He's escaping. Throw it, sir. Careful, sir. He's dead, sir! He's dead?! He's dead?! How can he die? What happened? Sir, our Chairman and Principal threw rods at him. He got hit and fell down. I swear it wasn't their intention to kill him. But he died anyway. Whose box is that? It belongs to our Principal. He hit him because he stole that carton. Check it. Sir, it's cocaine. What is this, Mr. Kanakaraju? You hold a responsible position. You're supposed to shape students' futures. Not ruin their careers. You're highly educated. Don't you know it's a crime to sell and buy drugs? Now whose bag is this? Our Chairman. What's in it? Important files belonging to sir. Am I right? Yes. My files. Check that as well. I told you there are files in it. I swear those are files. This bag is full of files, sir. Files?! What the hell! But that's what you said. Files, my foot! I put all my black money from cricket betting in it. Brand new 2000 rupees notes. What? Yes! You're a powerhouse in the society. On top of that, you're a successful businessman. You know something? I always tell my son to seek inspiration from you. Do you know how many families are shattered because of what you do? Say something! What do you want me to say? You can yell at me, hit me even. You can also hang me. But please find my money. Find the person who took it. His money is safe, sir. It's in this room only. Oh my god! Take a look at this video. You'll understand. I don't want to go there. I'll look over here this time. Money! Sir! MLA sir! What? I found money in the bag. You did? So his PA was telling the truth. Yes, sir. Do something. Take that money and come out. We can share it later. Got it? Okay, sir. Holy shit! So, the MLA was eying my money for his party fund. Oh my god! Everyone's a culprit. Constables, arrest all of them! No, sir. Listen. Move it. Sir, please. Please listen to me. How did you find out about this? Revanth messaged Jahnavi about it. Yes, sir. Oh. Very good, Yuva. You found out who's behind the two major problems youth is facing today. Anyway, it's time to celebrate this discovery. Great job. Thank you, sir. All the best! Thank you so much. All the best. Thank you, sir. Sir, I'm begging you. I really don't know anything. Please let me go. Ah! Damn it! So, Chairman was there to hide his money. MLA and SI were there to steal it. And the Principal was there for his drugs. Who committed this murder then? We're back to square one. Who could've killed him? If it's neither of them... Maybe he committed suicide due to some personal issue. Don't be crazy. Why would someone commit suicide from the top of a cupboard? Are you saying that his dead body moved itself to the top shelf? What are you saying? Why did you kill him? Yuva! What the hell! Why would I kill him? Stop pretending, Karan. Tell me why you killed him. Why would I kill him? Why would he kill him? He only killed him! Where did you find the dead body? In the left side cupboard. On the bottom shelf. I know, right? He also found it there only. Yes. Then how did he know that the dead body was on the top shelf? So he either placed the body there. Or he knows who put it there. Tell me! Yuva, I'm innocent. Tell me! Hey! I only killed him! I only killed him! He was my friend before we even met. He got me into betting, saying it's easy money. Watching it with normal rules is no fun. Let's bet. I was so addicted that I gave him all my money. The money I saved for my mom's operation and sister's wedding. He took all my money and cheated me. I let it go. But he got my sister using drugs and took advantage of her. She O.D'd and became mentally unstable. Why didn't you tell any of us? He would blackmail me using vulnerable videos of my sister. Even yesterday, he called me asking for more money. So I went to the office room to talk to him. Revanth... Hey, did you bring the money? No. I gave you everything I had. Please give me those videos. My sister's sensitive. I didn't make those videos to return them to you. I made them for viewing, whenever I'm in the mood. I didn't tell anyone about you. I don't even have any money left to give you. What will you do with those videos? Let's do something. You don't have any money and neither do I. Let's post this video on YouTube. They will only pay us. What say? Hey, Revanth! No! Let go! Give me that. Leave me! How dare you fight back! I'll kill you! Upload it now. You bastard! Revanth! Revanth! I killed him by accident. I didn't know what to do. I put the body in that cupboard. I can't believe Revanth did all this. It's not just you. No one in this college would believe it. Claiming him to be the best student ever... Our Principal is only running a drug racket through him. You know something? Those slips didn't end up around you by mistake. He envied you when you topped in the first year. So he made sure that the squad caught you with those slips. You might be telling the truth. But he's dead now, because of your mistake. How will you avoid the murder charges? We'll help him. Hmm. Like you keep saying... We can't do anything if we're helpless. But when we do have the chance, we must try and help the good side conquer. Let's help Karan and make the good triumph. All right. Revanth shattered your family. He must've been on the forefront. But our Chairman and Principal shatter many families indirectly. We must stop them right away. One shot. Two birds. He'll be saved. They'll be framed. Yeah. Jahnavi, send these videos to your phone. Why? Do as told. Thanks, man. Now that your problem is solved... I have to go and save my relationship. Our Principal and Chairman together killed Revanth. What's going on here? But I just realized something. I panicked throughout the second half for no reason. I was just a joker in this pack of cards. I imagined a storyline and it turned out to be real? Based on a true story. Uh-huh. True story based on my story. Listen, Shobi. Let it go. Please try to understand. Get lost! You devil! You're the reason this whole thing happened. I was minding my own business. But you sent me to the office room to get things going. That's where all the chaos began. What are you saying? What happened? I don't have the patience to tell you the whole thing. Watch the next show with them. Cut it! “I'm losing my mind for the first time because of you” “I've forgotten all about the world” “I feel like a little baby all over again, talking to you” “I'm desperate to crash in your lap” “I've never expected that I'd change to this extent” “I'm afloat in a colorful world with your presence” “What's happening?” “When have I come this far?” “I've followed your footsteps like a shadow” “What's happening?” “Looks like I've lost my way” “But it's lovely being here with you” “What's happening?” “I wonder how much time has passed” “I feel this mesmerized when I look at you” “What's happening?” “My heart is bouncing around in madness” “I wonder where my heart is” “I find it clinging onto you” “Maybe I'm day dreaming” “Can I call you mine?” “I can't stop taking your name”
