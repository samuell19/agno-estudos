I've said yes to a few opportunities that have come my way that could be taken as being rather risky. Have a safe journey back to Dili. Thank you. But essentially I have only acted according to my conscience... and done what I thought was in line with the truth as I saw it. It all began on December 7, 1975. The Indonesian army invaded East Timor. Only 300 miles north of Australia, East Timor was a Portuguese colony. Indonesian troops, backed by planes and warships, invaded the territory, which had belonged to Portugal for 400 years. East Timorese have been fighting them since. Two days before the invasion President Gerald Ford and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger were in Indonesia to meet the country's president General Suharto. I raise my glass and propose a toast. A conflict, a killing ground in a remote area of the Far East, where up to 200,000 people have died from massacres and famine over the last 16 years. East Timor is an occupied territory with Indonesia violating UN resolutions. The Catholic Church says human rights abuses are widespread. Graphic photos of Indonesian soldiers torturing young East Timorese men. If you feel uncomfortable we advise you to turn your attention elsewhere. Timorese resistance has survived in the jungle trying to keep the idea of independence alive. Viva Timor Leste! Viva! East Timor has recently opened to tourism but journalists are not allowed. I first visited East Timor in 1990. Up until that time it had been completely cut off from the outside world. There was, on the one hand, this terrible anxiety. At the same time I derived some sense of enjoyment from the fact that this was gonna be very risky. That appealed to me. I had a video camera, which immediately meant that I was the subject of great suspicion. The whole place was just a hive of paranoia. There was a man keenly interested in why I was there. It was pretty clear to me that he was an intelligence agent. He confronted me at one point to ask whether I was a journalist and I said to him "No, I'm just a tourist documenting my holiday "and the camera is just part of my happy snaps "to show to family and friends." I remember crying myself to sleep one night because the tension was too much to bear. I didn't quite anticipate the beauty of the country... those beautiful mountains... this pristine turquoise sea. Throughout that first visit I was being passed notes, messages to be sent out abroad. And I was often able to help out with translations into English. Were you handed any photographs? Yeah, I was given a number of photographs. Extremely dramatic images. Were there photos of Xanana? Yeah. There were photos of Xanana. But of course I'd seen his image prior to that. From his jungle hideout in the mountains of East Timor Xanana Gusmao delivers a message of resistance. Very little is known about this enigmatic warrior poet who fights with both his pen and sword. As the commander of the armed resistance known as FALINTIL, Xanana inspires his people with the cry "To resist is to win." My thoughts about Xanana were shaped by my Timorese friends. He was their hero, someone that they worshipped. He supposedly had magical powers to transform himself into a dog or into other animals. Their stories abounded about how he managed to avoid being arrested. I probably had a very ordinary childhood. But certainly my parents were very special in that they had their eyes open to the world. When I was a child of about four my father went back to study Indonesian. So he would come home in the evenings and teach my brother and I some simple phrases. 'Apa kabar?' How are you? 'Baik-baik saja.' It was on the strength of that childhood connection that I decided to study Indonesian as an elective. And it was there that I stumbled across an issue of 'Inside Indonesia'. It was not of the common mould of publications about Indonesia. It was actually hard-hitting. We were basically saying there's more to Indonesia than Suharto and the military... There's more to Indonesia than Bali, "the morning of the world", the most beautiful holiday destination one could possibly imagine, or the other extreme, East Timor. I had a few thoughts and perceptions of my own that I was keen to share. So I tried to find out where it was published and how I could get involved. She could turn her hand to anything. She could write. She could translate. She could edit. Pat came to be a very important mentor to me. This is the old 'Inside Indonesia' office here. Through Pat I met a number of important political activists and dissidents such as Jose Ramos-Horta. He was someone very charismatic, very much linked in people's minds to the struggle in much the same way Xanana was. I had just made one of my yearly trips to Australia to campaign for Timor, to talk to solidarity groups. I walk into the office one day and there she was. Very pretty, proper in her manners, also very committed to East Timor. Suharto opened up East Timor at the beginning of 89. By that stage there was a steady trickle of brave souls wanting to expose the reality of what was going on there. The next time I travelled to East Timor it was part of a documentary filmmaking team. We flew into Bali. We decked ourselves out in Bali T-shirts to look as innocuous as possible, used the time there to hone our skills and our moves as tourists. We came forward with the idea of being adventure tourist frontrunners. So if anybody asked me what I was doing I would enthusiastically engage them in a discussion about the possibilities for adventure tourism in Timor. Wait just one second, okay. I'll be with you. Sorry to keep you. Kirsty was employed by the producer as interpreter, as a person who had been to Timor as well. She'd been only for a week but at that stage that was a lot. Almost nobody else had been there at all. Okay, smile, please. Done. I was quite anxious about how easy it would be to pull off this huge stunt that we were planning. Why are we stopping here? I don't know. Kirsty! Think we can take pictures here? Is it okay? Yeah? Well, ask anybody. Ask just, you know... Okay, move back, back, back... No, no, this way. Against the wall. I was trying to find a way to film without getting my camera taken away and getting kicked out of the country. There were moments where I found it extremely difficult to actually contain my disgust and to actually do the job I was supposed to be doing. And you'd be catching glances and exchanging glances with people you didn't know. You could see in people's eyes they were too scared to be seen. There was such a desperate desire to have the story told and to actually be able to make contact with journalists and with people like us. I got information that there was a television crew who wanted to meet with Xanana Gusmao. Xanana wanted to see them, of course. Unfortunately, the situation was so tense. He was the most wanted man in Timor. Everybody in Timor... wanted to protect Xanana. So many people die for him... to protect him. The media, information, became our most powerful weapon. The journalists were the only people we trust to channel our grievances abroad. So I organised for them to interview some young people. This demonstration had very provocative banners supporting Xanana. Viva Xanana Gusmao! Viva! Viva! Viva! They walked straight past me towards the entrance to the Santa Cruz Cemetery, where they gathered. These are military police, 'Brimob' as they call them in Indonesia. Not all of them are in charge, though. These are the guys that are in charge, these people. I was just setting up to start filming. GUNFIRE SIREN WAILS I was very determined to try to capture what was going on or something of it. Clearly these guys are surrounding this place and they're gonna capture everybody in it and that's gonna include me. So I stop the tape, put it into a plastic bag, bury it in a grave that was next to me. For the first time East Timor was front-page news everywhere in the world. A conflict, a killing ground in a remote area of the Far East, is beginning, just beginning, to get the world's attention. That is because Western reporters were inside Indonesia when soldiers opened fire on a group of civilians. Up to 200 people are thought to have been killed when troops opened fire on an independence demonstration last week. 80 or so, maybe 100 people, taken out in trucks and executed by firing squad. Dozens of demonstrators gathered outside the Indonesian Embassy, their wreaths a tribute to those who were slaughtered by Indonesian troops. So many of the people that we had just spent time with and recorded their stories being gunned down in that massacre, it was dreadful. The shootings at the Santa Cruz Cemetery have galvanised Portuguese public opinion. That was the beginning of the end of the Indonesian occupation. Indonesia had no other ways to manipulate the international community's opinion. The Indonesian ambassador has said that the Indonesian troops opened fire on the demonstrators in self-defence. The Timorese hope the massacre will focus Western attention on the repression which has cost the lives of 2000,000 people since the country was annexed by Indonesia 16 years ago. After the experience of making the film and the aftermath I really wanted to be closer to the heart of the action. So I managed to make some contacts in Indonesia. In Jakarta there were constant Friday afternoon cocktail parties and so I would invite Kirsty. And the two of us, we would be telling the diplomats and consultants in the gentlest, nicest way about what was happening in East Timor, to take on board some of these issues. It was easier to do it in twos. We were like two little conspirators really. I met Victoria on one of my earliest visits to Jakarta. (Laughs) Do it again! We both had a strong love for Indonesia in spite of being aware of the horrors that were happening at so many levels in the country. There were quite a lot of Timorese students in Jakarta. FAINT GUNFIRE, SCREAMS AND SIRENS When they saw the footage of the Santa Cruz massacre they decided that something needed to be done. When November 12 happen in Dili we plan a demonstration in Jakarta. There was a growing student movement. There was this sense that "Finally we have this opportunity "to actually get the word out and communicate what we want, "what our deepest aspirations are for ourselves and for our country." Never before had Timorese students held a demonstration in Indonesia because it was forbidden to hold demonstrations, especially for the Timorese. They started walking in formation with their posters. Joao was right in the front. I was walking backwards, taking photos. We distribute a statement to the UN and to the embassies that we passed through. We asked the UN to support the Timorese struggle for independence, to free the Timorese from the human rights violations in the country. Within five minutes, Intelligence was called. They'd all been arrested. In the court they start saying that "Well, you were against the president "and against integration of Timor to Indonesia, "so you are charged with subversion. "The penalty that you will get will be life... "or you can be punished to death. "If you apologies to His Excellency President Suharto "you will be released "and when you finish your studies, go back to Timor, "you can become head of districts, even governor." And I said "I don't have these ambition. "I have the ambition to have my country free, independent. "And if you kill me I don't care. They said "Well, then you will go to prison. I said "I'm ready to face that situation. If you are in Indonesia in hospital or in prison there's nobody who looks after you to bring you food or the necessary things. So I took on these kind of jobs for all of the ones that one by one disappeared into Indonesian prisons. Victoria had to leave Jakarta. So she left me in charge of the liaison with the prison. ALARM BELL RINGS There was a big block for the Timorese political prisoners. I had responsibility in ensuring that Joao had a constant supply of funds, medicine, books - things to sustain him in his daily life. ALARM BELL RINGS I also was channelling funds from Amnesty International to Joao and to the other East Timorese political prisoners inside Cipinang Prison. 20 November 1992, the news on the BBC was completely devastating, namely Xanana had been captured. It was at this house in Dili that the Indonesian army finally arrested Xanana after a 16-year search. They waited in silence for him as he emerged from a secret hideaway below a cupboard. When Xanana was arrested in Timor, for us was really very sad. You fought for an objective and all of a sudden you see your leader is in the hands of the enemies. The leader of East Timor's resistance movement today sentenced to life imprisonment after being convicted of leading a separatist movement and illegal possession of weapons. It seemed like a terrible blow at the time to the people's morale and their will to resist. Also as Xanana prepared to read his defence plea this week, the judge stopped him, saying it was irrelevant. But a smuggled-out copy reveals that he planned to begin a hunger strike four days ago. In the statement he says it's the Indonesian government that should be on trial for its crimes over 17 years. The Indonesians, they didn't want Xanana to join us in the same prison. So he didn't eat. Moving Xanana to Cipinang was our strategy. We prepared a room for him in our block. (Laughs) Oosh! Xanana has this kind of charismatic way of dealing with other people. So he became a very good friend of all prisoners, even security people! Some call him 'my president'. Some call him 'my commander'. We had to write, to respond letters, so we did everything inside and then we sent through the security people and then they give to our people outside the prison. Everyone that was involved in the clandestine movement had a code name. I adopted Ruby Blade. So began my double life as Ruby Blade. When you operate in Jakarta in support of the resistance you have to be extremely careful, disguising your identity. You have to be absolutely discreet. The way she is, very refined, elegant... who would think that she can be mischievous? The forces of good are about to go into action. I start to use her often as courier... going back and forth to Xanana Gusmao when he was in prison. I played an active role in couriering information, documents... interviews, in and out of the prison. It was a big sense of responsibility to play the role of conveyor of information, being able to make sure that his letters to presidents and world leaders... to people like Ramos-Horta, actually reached their destination. She would courier money for Xanana for the resistance and he would bribe prison officials. He would refer to the six or 12 prison guards who are under his payroll as "my staff". So every month he was paying 50 dollars something to each prison guard, a lot of money. Once she establish more frequent communication with Xanana, then she start conveying to him some very important documents from me, audio cassettes mostly, whereby in voice I would communicate with Xanana and Xanana would communicate to me in voice. I can still remember listening to the first audio cassette and just being so blown away by hearing Xanana speak... cos I had never heard his voice before. We were able to become increasingly more sophisticated in our means of communications... starting with audio cassettes and then computers... video cameras... finally a mobile phone. Nothing happened without Xanana's green light. He was the one directing the resistance in all the fields... military... political... clandestine work... or diplomatically. Any new initiative had to be cleared with him. So Kirsty was a critical link. Modem! Email, this was just like this most sophisticated weapon and just this incredible resource that virtually no one at that point had access to. Xanana was emailing me. He wouldn't email directly. He would type up and Kirsty would email it to me. And he was talking certain Internet language that made me embarrassed. I said "What the hell he's talking about? "Does he know more Internet than me? "He's in prison and he knows more Internet than me." So I said "God, I better update my own knowledge of Internet." Let's just see how we can undermine the regime. So... These are photographs taken inside my home in Tebet Timur Dalam, which was actually not far from Cipinang Prison. When I came to her house I would find her with the latest letter from prison and we'd be reading it, rejoicing in some of the things and despairing with others. And while we were sitting there, there was a knock on the gate and Kirsty would be coming back with an armful of bonsai trees. And I said "Was there a hawker outside selling bonsai trees?" "No" she said. "Fancy this. "They're coming from Xanana himself, from the prison." Then I looked at all the other bonsais that were already in the garden. (Groans) (Man laughs) A form of prisoner rehabilitation was the cultivation of bonsai plants. And Xanana took to this activity with some great gusto... ..and very proudly would send me out samples. So you can imagine the poor courier guy that would bring these things in and out of prison would turn up at my door lugging these plants. He spent quite a lot of time on creating the nicest possible conditions for his tropical fish inside his cell. I think the first fish he sent me were Spanish fighting fish. "5 July 1995, 11.15 p.m. "Hi, darling, I'm writing to you to talk about the fish. "One, you'll need to change the water every second day." (Laughs) "Afterwards I'll send you another bowl. "It's just a question of time for me to arrange some little things, "ornaments to make the fishes' life less monotonous and wearisome, "as they're in the water without any ornaments. "Never wash the bowl out with soap. "You can rub the surrounding wall but not the base "so that you can allow moss to start growing "as these stupid animals eat moss. "Take care of the animals." I would film myself watering his bonsais. He would film himself in his cell. And it was just about enhancing that sense of whilst being separate, a sense of a shared life together in the most strange, unorthodox circumstances. I can't believe it. "I feel another sensation in trying to be dishonest "when I told you I'd only woken up a little while ago "and didn't telephone you. "It's a good feeling. "It's agreeable when one feels that one is lying to one's self. Hoh! "11.30 p.m. You still haven't arrived. "I'm probably gonna keep this characteristic, "being dishonest to myself. "Now I'm going to bed because I'm beginning to feel sleepy. "1.17 a.m. I was a bit shock when I heard after all they had a relationship. What would that mean for the resistance? What would that mean for Xanana's image, for Kirsty's effectiveness? As far as I'm concerned I do not recall ever commenting on that particular relationship with anyone. I had serious doubts. Why me? Is it just because I'm the only one, really? It's not like he has a whole lot of choices. Xanana's in a very lonely environment and would have craved that intimacy with someone. That was a great source of anxiety and angst for me for quite some time. But certainly by the time I gained my first entry - and these are photographs of our first meeting face to face in Cipinang in December 1994... certainly by then there was already a very strong bond. We had the most amazing few hours together. We were able to sit together. We were able to converse together. We were conscious that we may not, for a very long time, be able to repeat this experience. So we were just intent on being able to enjoy and revel in every single moment of togetherness. Xanana has a mobile phone in the prison. Xanana told me that we have changed our strategy to win the war. "You have to go to Jakarta "to work with the Indonesian pro-democracy movement." The Indonesian, they also suffer under dictatorial regime. So when change happen in Indonesia it will allow us to have a referendum in East Timor. I contact with one of my friends in Jakarta. He say that one lady from Australia want to meet you... so-called "special courier". Xanana introduced me to Putu, as we knew him back then... and to another colleague called Komodo. Xanana asked me to offer whatever help I could. The government and the media always campaign that East Timorese has chosen integration. But actually we want to independent. So how we change the mentality of Indonesian themself? How we can work together with the pro-democracy movement? We had a meeting with Kirsty to organise because she really have a good connection to all different organisation... Amnesty International and human right and all, actually all the journalists. She had appeared somewhat mysteriously on the radar, introducing herself through faxes and various letters. I didn't know her real name was Kirsty. I really only knew her as Ruby Blade. And she said "Look, something's going to happen "in a couple of weeks. "I'm not at liberty to say exactly what it is "but it maybe something that leads to some human rights problems. "We want Amnesty to know about it." About 50 protestors demanding independence for East Timor forced their way into the Russian Embassy in the Indonesian capital, marking the day 20 years ago when Indonesia forced its way into the former Portuguese colony. Xanana asked me to lead the demonstration of 7 December. Viva Timor Leste. Viva! Viva! All my comrades, especially pro-democracy members, we all jumped together. The pro-independence demonstrators were not all East Timorese. A third were said to be Indonesian. At the same time as the protest here, about 60 demonstrators also managed to get inside the Dutch embassy. Typically it would take a matter of days to gather sufficient information about an event like this and produce a report, if you were lucky. More likely it would be weeks. In this case we had all the information. And we prepared a four-page report complete with photographs, biographical details... And then we circulated it around to Amnesty offices, causing the Indonesian foreign minister to accuse Amnesty of orchestrating the event. It was organised. It's just that it wasn't Amnesty that organised it. In the lead-up to that action I would often just purely for practical reasons encourage people to come to my home. That drew much more attention to my place of residence. So that contributed to there being a greater awareness amongst the intelligence community of my existence. No, look, once they're in the hands of the police I mean, there's very little that anyone can do except... I'd heard clicks on the line and I knew there was a good chance that my phone was being tapped. Who was that? I started receiving visits from members of the Indonesian military. I was fortunate enough not to actually be home at the time. My maid told me there had been this visit and a lot of questions asked - who I was, what I was doing in Jakarta. One of the protestor, he was captured and he mentioned the place where we had a meeting before. I was with her on the phone. She said "I have to run because the Indonesians are chasing me." If I'd shown my face on the street I was likely to have got arrested. SIREN WAILS There were stories circulating that my photo would be posted at airports. So with the help of friends I'd managed to work out an alternative route back to Australia. When I got back to Melbourne I discovered I'd been blacklisted. But I did return to Indonesia through fairly devious means. Inside one of my first letters to Xanana I enclosed a photograph of me in a beautiful idyllic landscape in Java. And it was a photograph where you couldn't see my face and I considered it at the time to be safe to send into the prison. For my birthday the following year Xanana sent me a painting he had done of the photograph. I sent him a photograph of me gazing at the painting. And he subsequently did a painting of that. This continued for a number of years until we had a series of paintings and photographs that we refer to as the "tunnel of time". He was unable to complete the painting of the final photograph because of very rapid political developments inside Indonesia. For the second day Jakarta echoed to gunfire as police, backed by troops, made a vain attempt to curb street protests. Complete anarchy here at the moment. The police are totally outnumbered by the people. It was the moment the people of Indonesia had been demanding for months. After 32 years of power President Suharto finally resigned. Before he'd even finished speaking, jubilation erupted at Parliament, where thousands of students were occupying the complex for the fourth day. After Suharto had fallen Xanana was moved into house arrest. It wasn't until then that there was any sense that there might be some sort of future for us. At that point we'd developed a very strong sense of teamwork. The political situation inside Indonesia had changed dramatically in relation to East Timor. This is a historic moment. I'm delighted to tell you that we have just signed the three agreements on East Timor, as you saw, between the Republic of Indonesia and the Republic of Portugal. We will be offering to the East Timorese people a choice, a special status within the Indonesian Republic with wide-ranging autonomy or to go our separate ways in an honourable, peaceful way. I was extremely critical of the May 5 agreement. It was obvious the agreement had huge flaws, one that gave security responsibility to Indonesia. But Xanana was absolutely wise in saying "Regardless of the flaws we must seize this opportunity." I can remember having conversation with Xanana, tension in his voice as we spoke because I think he realised "We're on the verge of something really big here "and this could be what we've been fighting all these years for." The United Nations staff are already on their way to the region to begin preparing for the popular consultation. All of us are determined to ensure that it is free, fair and thorough. When I arrived in East Timor with the United Nations and saw the UN flag there it was extremely moving to me. The UN had this mythical stature. If the UN could just be here, things might turn out differently. Via phone Xanana was able to maintain regular contact to get a sense of what the mood, what the morale was in East Timor. There were a lot of rumours. There were a lot of informal intelligence reports that indicated that there was something big planned and that it was being coordinated at the highest levels. There were a number of things. Your first was that there were these militia groups... set up by the Indonesian army... overwhelmingly young Timorese guys. They typically were wearing red-and-white bandanas, the colours of the Indonesian flag. We saw them all over the place in the company of the army. They were in army and police trucks. They would hold rallies and the army would be around there watching them as they threatened people... quite deliberately provoking violence. There was a real danger that the pro-independence side would be led into a violent clash. What Xanana did at that moment, against all of the pressure to fight back, was to say "Our side will not use violence. "And you can continue to torment and burn and attack "but we will not be provoked." Xanana forbid the FALINTIL to respond to the provocations and to the violence. A very difficult decision cos the natural instinct of those men was to defend the people. (Sobs) Xanana got a lot of phone calls passing information that big tragedy will happen. Xanana said "Keep everything in your heart. "If they ask you to put Indonesian flag in front of your house, do it! "They will not know what you have in your deep heart. "Vote for independence. They don't know that. "You vote for independence." The day of the referendum was really extraordinary. People walked, some of them four, five hours, to get to the polling station. And most people were in line before the polling booths opened at 6.30 in the morning. People were coming to the polls with their rice and their cooking pots and their blankets. Everybody knew that there would be violence. So they came to vote and then they were gonna be refugees. All the people lined like this. And even under sun, hot sun, they are there because they are sure that that moment is a crucial moment for the country. They have to be there and vote for independence. After the polls closed it was really quiet. We were driving through Dili and there were people on the street and we were waving to them. And they were going... Just like quite subdued actually. Essentially they were doing whatever they could to avoid provoking any kind of violence. In a show of courage and determination the people of East Timor turned out in massive numbers to vote in the popular consultation, expressing their will as to the future of the territory. We were anticipating that unless the results were tampered with there would be an overwhelming decision in favour of independence. The people of East Timor have thus rejected the proposed special autonomy and expressed their wish to begin a process of transition towards independence. There was no celebration at all. Things were so desperate on the ground in Timor at that time that no one really felt like celebrating. GUNFIRE And the militias are moving freely up the road and there's quite a number of them and I'm running. Suddenly there were militiamen running towards us from all directions wielding machetes. They were screaming incoherently. And the police again seemed unable or unwilling to stop them. Armed gangs now have control across East Timor... the bloodbath retribution against East Timor's independence vote. I promise as a free man I will do everything to bring peace to East Timor and to my people. They announced Xanana was going to be released 24 hours or so before. Xanana, how do you feel, sir? Is it safe to go back at the moment? There was a lot of anti-East-Timor sentiment, so it was quite a security situation. He was released into the British embassy. For security reasons he wasn't able to return immediately to East Timor. As we go to air, fresh clashes have erupted in East Timor, this time in the capital Dili itself right outside the offices of United Nations Mission in East Timor. The violence, which had been pretty serious, suddenly became much more serious. The United Nations staff, all staff were confined to the UN compound and we were joined there by... perhaps as many as 2000 East Timorese refugees and several hundred local East Timorese UN staff. This gate's getting old but you can still see the sign of the UN here. Timorese has been terrified for 24 years. But that day the most terrifying moment when they started hearing the gunshot getting closer and closer. CONTINUOUS GUNFIRE There we were, completely unarmed, surrounded by militias and the police and the army, who were supposed to be preserving order, who weren't doing anything. Everything outside of the compound was on fire. You could hear weapons fire. You could see black smoke rising from the city. Dili and all surrounding areas were being systematically destroyed. There were some militia guys on that hill. The gunshot coming from here, the gunshot coming from that area. A bunch of people who had been just outside became extremely scared. (People scream) Somebody in desperation threw their child, a baby, up over the fence in the hope that... Living that violence from a distance was extremely difficult and distressing. It was really difficult. Especially for Xanana as commander it was really difficult. I appeal to the international community to help these heroic, so defenceless people, to stop the violence, to stop the killings. Xanana was desperate, beside himself. He was just on the phone with General Taur Matan Ruak, who was in the cantonment. And Xanana said Taur Matan Ruak was very angry with international community because, he said, no one was doing anything, people were being killed. Taur Matan Ruak said... Then hung up. I managed to speak to Taur Matan Ruak. I said "Companero, this is a time "to close ranks behind our Commander in Chief. "Listen to him, stay in the camp." Xanana's orders ended the decision by Taur Matan Ruak, FALINTIL. Not to respond weapon with weapon, fire with fire, killing with killing, that was the wisest. Xanana and Jose Ramos-Horta decided that a visit to friendly nations around the world was imperative. There was a lot of work to be done shoring up support from the international community to have international peacekeepers allowed onto Timorese soil. Practise reading. Tsk! Viva! Xanana came ahead first to Timor. He was still not completely comfortable that there was secure conditions. But within 24 hours called me to say "You can come." The thing that impressed me when I first arrived was "My God, this country has been completely shattered. "The people may have no shoes on their feet. "They may have no home to go to. "They may have just lost all of their belongings "and lost family members. "But people look happy." (People cheer) (People cheer) Viva! Viva! (People applaud, whistle and cheer) Hoo-ee! There was this jubilation and yet it was tempered always by the grief and by the wounds that were still so fresh. (Sobs) We did a tour around the country. (People whistle and cheer) The reaction to Xanana, to his physical presence, was a source of joy but it also elicited a lot of deep emotion and grief in people, particularly women. (Woman keens) (Women sob) I can remember thinking "My goodness. "How can he possibly have anything left after that?" And to then have to get in a car to travel another hour to go to the next village and to face it all again. And day after day after day of the same. (Woman keens) Amazing for me to witness and I guess to have confirmed that love that people felt for him. I knew he'd always put the public and the political first and I knew that that would guide all major decisions that he would make. CHOIR SINGS Today you are witnesses of the aspiration for peace of all people and today you are witnesses to the hope for the future. CROWD APPLAUDS CROWD CHEERS I found myself pregnant with my first son. So it seemed the ideal time to get married. (Speaks Portuguese) Viva! FEMALE VOCALS It was extremely important at the emotional level to give birth to my first son on Timorese soil. Who's a big boy? He's gonna walk to Mummy. In many ways the growth and development of our first son Alexandre... went on a parallel course with Timor-Leste's own growth and development as a young nation. An individual does have the power to make a difference. That lesson is a gift from the Timorese people to the world. I share with you all a big Timor-Leste hug of 'obrigado barak'. "Free Xanana Gusmao." That's in Portugal. Viva Xanana Gusmao! Viva! Safe journey, ma'am. Thank you.
