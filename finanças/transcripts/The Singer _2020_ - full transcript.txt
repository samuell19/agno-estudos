After the Japanese and Manchu Invasion, Joseon's very foundation began to crumble. The worsening political conflicts harmed the country, and the corrupt governing class exploited the people. As the country descended in to chaos, one thing that helped the people carry on was the songs of traveling storytellers, the Gwangdae. Although they belonged to the lowest class their songs about the lives of the commoners, gave rise to 'Pansori', a genre of narrative songs. ♪ When the heavens opened ♪ ♪ And the land was created ♪ ♪ The country was peaceful ♪ ♪ and the people were content ♪ ♪ Times changed and a ♪ ♪ new capital was found ♪ ♪ Samgak Mountain rose ♪ ♪ and the phoenix soared ♪ ♪ In the place of the phoenix ♪ ♪ The great palace was built ♪ Hey!

Sir, it's too much. Yeah, it's way more than mine. You just keep the rhythm. You're too wayward with the beats. I gotta keep 'em entertained first. Good job today. Hurry and get going. Thank you, sir. There once lived a singer named Sim Hak-gyu of Dohwa Village with his seamstress wife, Gan-nan and a daughter named Cheong. Lotus flowers! You're right. They're so pretty... Huh? Huh! Look there. That's a golden lotus. Golden lotuses belong to the heavens. That's a rare flower. I want to take it home. I'll get it for you. No! The water's too deep.

You're always just having fun singing like this. When did I sing like that? I sing like this! You don't know how hard it is to make people laugh and cry. What's so hard about that? I can do it too! That's not how you do it. Do it like me! You'll wake up Cheong. I think she's fast asleep. What are you doing? You're embarrassing me! Stay still. Some criminals colluded with corrupt government officials and formed 'Ja-mae Gang' to kidnap and even kill innocent people.

So all I need to do is take this to Scholar Kim? Yeah. Make sure you get three coins. If you come back without the money, I'll kill you. Alright, I got it.

It's unfortunate that you were born low. Who can decide people's class, anyway? Is it the king? The ministers? You speak too recklessly. There's no way to tell the class by appearance! Hey...

What should I do, sir? She will be up soon. Don't worry. But since she hurt herself hard, she may be suffering from further damage. What on earth happened to Gan-nan? Stand there. Move. Move. Hurry! Yes, sir. Go there. Why are you shaking? Stand still. Hurry, hurry! - What's your name? - Hyang. What's your talent? Talent? What's that? Damn... Come here. She's just a kid. What do you do well, then? I made a living by sewing for nobles. Why do you ask? Just answer me. I'm the one asking the questions here. Didn't I! Tell you! Not to! Touch! The goods? What? Go back to work! U-chil. Pass me the contract. Can you read? Listen carefully. You're from Pyeonghae. Your father died in the great famine. You needed to arrange his funeral, but didn't have any money, and promised that you'll work for us until death. Understand? What? Wanna see? This is a lie! A lie? But what to do? That's what the higher-ups told us to do. We're just following orders. Sir, sir! We were kidnapped. Help us! Let's go. Please look at this closely. Just once! We were kidnapped! Please help us! I think it's them. What do you mean? Didn't you see the notice at the market? Those criminals who call themselves 'Ja-mae Gang'. They kidnap lowborn people to sell as slaves. - But where can we find them? - Mom... Mom... mom! Cheong... Are you all right, Cheong? Dad... Mom... She... You were with your mom. Bad people took her. But Dad... Hm? I can't see your face well. What's wrong with me? Cheong... Cheong... Dad... Oh no... Poor little thing. We're ready. Sir. Walk faster! Walk faster! The Royal Inspector has arrived! Hey! You! Help me! Arrest all of them. Get up! Get up! We're not criminals. We were all kidnapped. Move quickly! - Move quickly! - We're not criminals! We're not criminals! Have you been well? Dad... What are you doing? Cheong... I'll need to go look for your mom. Bring me, too. What are you saying? Uncle Dae-bong will take care of you. - You have to wait here. - I don't want to. Take me, too! Let's look for mom together. Please... Now, let's go find her. What are you doing here? What's all that stuff? My wife threw me out because I'm no use. I have nowhere to go. Your wife passed away long ago. Don't joke around like that. No sense of humor. The best singer needs the best drummer by his side! Right, Cheong? Are you okay? Let me carry her. It's okay, man. Dad, I'm fine now. Please put me down. Your father's still fine. Cheong. Do you want to hear a story? What story? Once upon a time, there was a pretty girl called Cheong. She was so pretty that all the townspeople praised her beauty. - Pretty Cheong? - Yes. Pretty, just like you. Cheong's mother was beautiful, kind and loved to laugh. She took good care of Cheong. But her father had become blind after an accident in his youth. So Cheong and her mother always led the way for him with a cane. Like this. Like this, like this. But they were so poor. Cheong's mother had to support the family by sewing. ♪ Embroidering patterns ♪ ♪ on silken clothes ♪ ♪ Making vests, belts and ♪ ♪ various kinds of hats ♪ ♪ Embroidering geese ♪ ♪ and cranes in five colors ♪ For arresting corrupt officials, I hereby announce his promotion. Your Majesty's grace is immeasurable. Did you prepare the best products? Of course. It's a long way up. Help! What's that? What's going on? Where? I can't see him. He must be dead. He's still alive. Really? How do you know? I can... I can hear it. Huh? Where? Over there... Is there a rock over there? I keep hearing a noise from over there. Be careful! Be careful! - He's alive. - He's back to life. Thank heavens! Are you all right? How did a Buddhist monk fall into the stream? He jumped in to catch fish... A monk eats fish? You saved my life. It isn't me. It's my daughter you should thank. I don't know how to repay you... Well, if you insist, you can buy us some food at the inn down the road. Me? Eat slowly, you'll get indigestion. Bring some more side dishes and soup please. You realize this is the third time you've asked for a refill? What kind of monk pigs out like him? Make sure you pick up your tab. How'd you two meet each other? You look like a merchant. You look like... a corrupt monk. Don't even get me started. There are bandits all over the mountain. I met this monk one day. He knows the mountain paths very well. Since I started traveling with him, we haven't seen a single bandit. Do you know anything about the 'Ja-mae Gang'? They're really notorious. All the government offices are after them. They must have been caught, then. Not even close. They're very organized. From what I hear, they have friends in high places supporting them. Who would help them? Probably corrupt government officials. Ma'am! Bring me some more side dishes here. You're going to eat the whole kitchen! Then give me just a spoonful of soup... You're going to bankrupt me! Hey, let's leave now. She's so scary. This is all thanks to Your Lordship. I've done nothing. It's all your achievement. What's troubling you, sir? The King has ordered me to take up a post in Jeonju. I heard that, too. Isn't that a good thing? Not quite. As soon as I leave the capital, those hyenas will accuse me of all the crimes. When you go down to Jeonju, submit an appeal. What appeal? Ask His Majesty to appoint me as your deputy. You should be strengthening your base in the capital, won't this put you at a disadvantage? Not at all. It's as you have always told me. Politics is.. All about money. Since we treated you well, have you forgotten that you are slaves? You are taking too long! I'll be back in the evening, have everything done by then. Yes, Ma'am... - Auntie... - Hm? My mom should be doing okay, right? Of course. What's this? Lotus flower. It looked too plain. It's so pretty. Hey, take her. Let me go! - Let me go! - Stop it, bitch.. - Auntie! Auntie! - Hyang! Hyang! - Auntie! - Hyang! Hyang! We're going to have to get rid of this bitch. It's been a long time. You should have done better. What happened to Hyang? The saying that clothes are like wings must be true. I couldn't even tell she was lowborn.

Thank you, sir. You look troubled. Is there anything I can do to help? You've got enough trouble sorting yourself out, Young Master. Please take a look at this woman. Very plain looking. It'll be difficult to find someone with this. What? No, what I mean is, her face has no distinguishing features. Like a birthmark under one eye. Shall I give you a new birthmark on your eye? Keep walking, man. These guys sure look wicked. Do you know them? Their faces are all over the place. How could we not? But by the way, did you take down a wanted poster? The officials won't be happy about that. This country is going to the dogs. Criminals are everywhere. Worry about yourself first. You'd be the first one to run away if we met them. Nonsense. Excuse me. What's up? I think we've met before. I don't know a beggar like you. What? I don't look like a beggar. You both look like beggars. Please, take a look. Please take a look at this woman. Please, take a close look. Have you seen this woman? Let's see. Isn't she that slave at the Minister's house? That seamstress slave? - Did you just say a seamstress? - Yes. - Where is that? - It's the biggest house down that way. Thank you so much. Excuse me! Excuse me! Who is it? Is this the Minister's house? Yes, why? I heard that there's a slave here who looks like this. Who's this crazy guy? Wait! Please take a closer look. You have no business here. Get lost! - Gan-nan! - Catch him! - Come here! - Gan-nan! Quick! Come here! Kick him! What are you doing looking for that dead bitch here? Dead? Don't lie to me! This one's still blabbering. Beat him hard. - Mom, look at this. - It dried well. Mom, I'm hungry. Hungry? I'll make some food! Uncle... Mom should be okay, right? Your mom's a strong woman. Don't worry. Excuse me... What? That song you sang at the marketplace, could you sing it again please? We're done for today. Please come next time. It's my mom's wish. Please? We don't have the singer. Leave now while I'm still being nice. Whatever! Then I'll just die right here. Don't be like that. Just one song, please! You're being difficult here! You've brought this mute, deaf and senile grandma! If you tell us where you live, I'll let you know when he returns. Don't be like that. Just one song! Okay. Just one song. Listen carefully. Leave now! - Just one song. - I gave you the song! That was it! - Go now! - I'm not going! - Go! - No way! - Go! - Nope! Granny... You want to hear a song? I'm blind and not very talented.

If that's the case, I have my reason, too. Money! What reason? You guys just like traveling. I just want to go home. This is what I get for serving a bad master. Why do you keep following us? Go your own ways! Traveling monks do not follow anyone. They simply walk where the road leads them. We follow the winds and the clouds. That's a load of bullcrap. You're just a beggar. Just follow the winds! Not us! Buddha said to repay those who save your life. I still have not repaid the girl. A corrupt monk talking about Buddha. Cheong, don't smile at him. He'll think you like him. Don't be too harsh. Cut him some slack. And you, why are you following us? Well, you see, travelling... is best when with good company. So you're just using any excuse to wheedle your way into our company and stay stuck to us like a leech, huh? Leech... For monks like me we sleep anywhere, and meditate whenever we're up. Even more rubbish out of that mouth. You two are both very eloquent. This makes me want to study. Now you want to study?

If so, it wouldn't be so heavenly. Cheong meets the Dragon King who sends her back to the human world And she is reborn. Just at that time, an emperor grieving his lost daughter was taking a walk in his gardens and found a golden lotus blooming in front of him Inside lay Sim Cheong How can she look so like the lost princess? This is the will of the heavens. Did we scare you? Take some rest. "Regaining health Sim Cheong became Princess Sim To find her blind father She hosts a party for all blind people of the kingdom Today is the last day of the festival The party was hosted to find her father But why has he not come? Did he think that I was dead Overcome with sorrow, did he depart this world? Today is the last day of the party Why hasn't he come?" The poor thing. I want to help him. I have a wife and children, too. This is creepy. Earlier I heard a rumour that is spreading in the streets. That 'Ja-mae Gang' were not caught because some powerful official has their back. - What are you talking about? - From what I heard... Thanks. We'd just run out. One of the three Ministers and an official in this region are colluding with each other! Is that true? Is that what people say? It's just a rumor that I heard. But these stories don't come out of thin air... Look at that monk drinking. I just remembered something. I heard that official is the head governor of this town. Does this fool have a death wish? I heard it when I was staying at a large temple. Yes, Your Majesty. The King won't be able to do anything. King? Who? I saw the governor and some noble lady visiting the temple together. This is too scary... Come here and have a drink. I'm going to go see an old friend. A friend? This late at night? He's going to go mooch some good food off them I guess. Sir! Take me too! The other day, there was word from the Vice Minister. What did he say? This man and I are going back to the capital. What did the king say? Since when did this country have a king? Your Excellency, please be careful. Why so worried? So-wol, did you hear what I said just now? Hear what? We don't even have ears, sir. Have you heard about the street storytellers? A singer and his group sing some made-up stories. They are very popular. Hundreds of people gather to hear the song. They all laugh and cry together. And at the end, the singer looks for his kidnapped wife. Is he that famous? I'd like to hear him, too. What were you doing while such rumors were spreading? - I'll go handle it right now. - No. Bring them alive. Criminals like them must be punished by the law. Be wary of Kim Tae-hyo. I sent him away from the palace, but still so many officials follow him, making it difficult to keep him away. My palace is already full of his people. I have come here because the situation is that dire. Do not think of me. Think of the people, dying of hunger and injustice. Cheong, my daughter! Cheong! Let me go! Let me go! Dad! Cheong, run away! Cheong... Cheong! You performed some strange show called 'pansori' or something, spreading rumors, making fun of the government, tarnishing the authority of the king. We never insulted His Majesty. We only put together a play to find a missing person. "Play"? You dare to call this "play"? Do you know your crimes? Confess now! Darling! Honey! Honey! - Honey! - Gan-nan... Gan-nan... Gan-nan... Gan-nan... I'm sorry I'm late. Honey. Cheong... Where's Cheong? Step back! Go away, you! Du-sik, it's your uncle. Watch your mouth to your family. - Step back! - That prick is so rude. Where were we in the story? It was just when Princess Sim was longing for her father. I need to hear the next part. Come on, man, let us in! Why are you being like this to me? Just go away! Dig in, please. Congratulations, sir! I heard that the king called you himself! Is that what they're saying? Your Excellency, people outside are demanding the release of the singer. That famous singer. Let's hear what he has to sing. How can you want to listen to such a lowly thing's song? If he's that popular, we should hear it at least once. These bastards have been traveling around the country, spreading rumors and insulting His Majesty. So we've arrested them on a charge of spreading rumors, conspiring against the king, and planning treason. Listen! I should really have you beaten to death, but I may spare you for the dignitaries here. Let's hear that famous pansori! I'm a nobleman, too. Hands off me! Well, no means no. I'm telling you to step aside. What's all this ruckus? I'm sorry, sir. Some shabby-looking beggar is asking to be let in, claiming he was invited. You fool, do you even know who I am? I am the fifth son of a former government official, Park. - Can you just go, please? - I'm telling you to step aside. Let that beggar aristocrat in. He is a very fitting crowd. Let him in. Oi, watch it! I thank you, Minister. You said you were going to see a former classmate, and this is where you come? All noblemen are the same. But Sir! My table is only piled high with vegetables, without a single lump of meat. What can be done about this? You there! Give the meat and side dishes on my table to that nobleman. Thank you. May you live long. Oh, and also... What now? Since you have such a talented singer, why don't you let those people in to enjoy the performance together? Look at that face. He is beaten up pretty badly. Look at those bruises... Cheong... You have violated the law of the land. But I will give you a chance. If you can make everyone laugh, no! If you can make everyone cry, I will spare your life. Even Hak-gyu can't make everyone here cry! I will do it. But, let those people live, too. You are in no position to bargain! It's okay. I can spare their lives too. You have my word. Get started. "Blind Man Sim finally made it to the party He waits for his food to come out Cheong asks the name of each blind man A servant stands in front of Sim - What is your name? - My name isn't important I'm so hungry. Bring me some food. Let me know your name first Then I'll give you rice, meat or whatever Even a wife if you have none Just answer! You are giving so many things I'm Sim Hak-gyu from Dohwa Village Blind Man Sim has arrived! I have sinned by selling my daughter This grand party Is for all blind men It must've been hosted To find and kill me Princess Sim ordered a retainer Find out who he is and whether he has children. When Blind Man Sim hears talk of children From his blind eyes, the tears drip, drip, drip down his face. Yes, let this blind man tell you Let this blind man tell you This blind man was born in Dohwa Village My name is Sim Hak-gyu I lost my wife in childbirth My motherless daughter I wrapped around in a blanket I went from door to door To ask nursing mothers to feed her I barely managed to raise her, and she became fifteen. Her name was Cheong. She was such a filial daughter. She went from door to door, Begging for food to feed us One day, I met a Buddhist monk He said I will see again If I donate three hundred bags of rice My darling daughter She sold herself to some Nanjing merchants for three hundred bags of rice It has been three years since she died in the waters of Indang Strait I still cannot see A sinner like me, who sold his own daughter Why should I still live? A sinner like me, who sold his own daughter, why should I still live? Please kill me, kill me now. Please kill me Hearing this, Princess Sim kicks her shoes away Rushes down Father... Hugs her father and says Father. Blind Man Sim, in great surprise, says Father? Who would call me Father?

Your daughter, drowned at Indang Strait Is alive in front of you Please open your eyes Please look at me Blind Man Sim hears this Does not know what to do My daughter Cheong Did I die? Am I in the Dragon King's Underwater Palace? Am I dreaming? Is this real? My dead daughter came back to life. What is going on? Let me see my daughter Let me see my daughter I need eyes to see This is killing me Let me see my daughter His eyes blink, blink, blink Blink, blink and then His two eyes open..." Father... Cheong, can you see...? Mom! Mom! That was a great show. I was so moved that I wrote a poem for you, Minister. I hope you read it I'm off now. What is this? You stirred up the people with those senseless rumors. Beat them to death. Fine liquor poured in golden cups is the blood of a thousand people. Delicate dishes on jade plates are the flesh of ten thousand common people. As the wax drips from the candle, the tears of the common people fall too. The louder the songs, the louder the cries of resentment. What is the matter? What's written there? Minister, sir. My old mother fell sick. I think I need to go now. Sir. My fifth wife is giving birth. What's wrong? Chop their heads off, now! Who are you? Open up! There's a long queue behind me. "An errand boy hurries into the government office Bearing a medallion, shining bright like the moon and the sun "It's the Royal Inspector's seal!" Raising it high, the office descends into chaos" No one move. The Royal Inspector has arrived! "All the attendants abandon the party Preparing for the Royal Inspector's arrival Calling the craftsmen to prepare his quarters, the errand boys sent out to surround the area The head servant to check the carriage, fix the sedan chair and spread out a tiger skin The steward to prepare the Royal Inspector's uniform, guards to put out the flags, All staff getting into position, the herald ready to transmit orders The Royal Inspector has arrived!" Inspector? Protect the Minister! Goddammit, let's get out of here! "Those who fed off sweat and tears, spilling innocent blood, Those torturing the people with unjust labour Round them all up As all this chaos is unfolding Gokseong county governor stands up and cries "My aged mother suddenly collapsed, I have to go" "My fifth wife is giving birth, I must hurry away" The governor is surprised, "What's wrong with you people? Are you going to be like this for some crappy poem? I'm going to catch that bastard and turn him into blood porridge!" Behold the Royal Inspector, he steps forward and gives the signal His men gather like a swarm of bees The inspector's seal raised high, shining bright like the moon and sun, They break through the gate, shouting The Royal Inspector has arrived!" Halt! Criminals Kim Tae-hyo and Kim Jun, kneel before His Majesty's command. What...? A royal inspector? How dare you threaten me? Clear our path. It's over! What's over? Don't make a mistake. What crimes have we committed? Do you have evidence? This is a list of mines and rifles you acquired illegally under the guise of the 'Ja-mae Gang.' This is all fake evidence! Bring the evidence. Your Lordship, please save me! You have kidnapped people and forced them to labor illegally. You bought these weapons with their blood in order to commit treason! You've got a death wish! You bastards! Don't you know who I am? How dare you! - Take him away. - Let me go at once! Your Lordship! Your Lordship! Raise your head. I'm sorry for deceiving you. Deep down, I always knew you were a great nobleman. Please forget everything I said before. No way. Your Lordship! Buy me drinks and I'll let it slide. Me? Thank you. Good girl. Cheong... Have your eyes opened once more? That's why I kept giving her all that herbal medicine. I didn't even know and kept cussing you out... I'm sorry and thank you. That's what family is for. I'm so glad, Cheong. That's how Hak-gyu and Cheong found Gan-nan. They were able to go back home. They look like sisters. Yeah. But we should still take Hyang back to her mother. I'm happy just thinking about them seeing each other. This pouch finally found its owner. All this time I was always jealous of Cheong's pouch. Your Lordship, are you coming with us? Don't call me Lordship, people might hear. Who's here besides us? There are eyes and ears everywh... Ugh. Bugs. Wow, this view is amazing! - Did you just cut me off on purpose? - Why are you still following us? Go your own way! Alright. If you can answer my question, you can follow us. If you can't, we say goodbye. What's the name of Seurirang's mother?
