--== McEphie ==-- Time to place your bets! Show me the money! Welcome to the big time! This is Versus Rap Battle League! Make some noise! Alright! Tonight's main event to my right the razor sharp MC of Guadalupe give it up for Pektus! To my left. The main man from Pandacan needs no introduction. Breezy G! Alright! B-Boy! Drop that shit! Hey Breezy G, this is a rap battle, you need to see the theme. "Breezy G"? What’s that? It’s like a dance group for a fiesta. Fuck you, motherfucker! All my bullets are precise. He used to be a man before the system turned him to shit. Covered himself with his brought crowd But the catch is they're all tough fags! This guy always wins because even the jury's scared of him! True! You're aggressive but you're a badass when they cut you. He's an automatic addict, so he's an addict when stopped. When I shoot the level's classic. It's like a three-point shot by Bal David of San Miguel. Henley says you're a whack. You serve no purpose here. You're like a band-aid stuck to Nelly. Don't you see? You're looking stupid. The only people here who'll clap for you is your family. Alright! Should I just kill this stupid shit? "Only my family?" Not good, really. All your words are empty, only stupid people buy it. All the women in your life have bad eyes: cross-eyed, boss-eyed, squint-eyed or just plain blind. Kid, you're all buster. You look like a tomboy with no boobies. This is permanent versus temporary. Original versus xerox copy. Your flow is kinda choppy. You're slow. My flow is like a tsunami! I ain't done! My bars are like beer. My hot words sear your heart. It leaves a scar. I’ll bring your naked cadaver in front of Baclaran Church. It's gonna say: "IDIOT RAPPER. Don’t be this guy!" I ain't done! You're a stupid rapper! You deserve a bronco buster! I'll choke you hard right after! Stone cold stunner! Motherfucker! Versus! Make some noise! Truly the lone hero of Pandacan! Breezy G! Knockout! RESPECT Before I let you be, lemme tell you about me. They call me General Boy Chua. Born in Manila, raised in Parañaque. Became a man in Metro San Jose, Cavite. To go with me is to go with the heat. You wanna interrupt me? I’ll melt you like butter. Simple bars, straight talk, we don't need your chatter. This guy on my left, he doesn't know any better. You want to clap? I'mma clap your face. It's your turn to enter this race. Spin the bottle, the guy on my left is next in place. I come from the tracks, I'm the end of the line. I don't need fancy shit. I just begin and roll mine. You say I have a big head, but it's my feet. Every stride I make, you need ten to keep up with me. You can say that I don't have manners. But with my bars, that doesn't really matter. Your rhymes are empty, unbelievable. I make people think, all you have is drivel. Yo, brothers from the tracks, let me cut in. Hendrix is here, let that be clear to the men who are fighting over some girl. Heart of a Filipino with the mind of a gangster. Motherfucker! Good-looking? That would be me, obviously. Ugly? That's all you, easy. Hold it, hold it. Who's this fucker jumping in? He thinks he's got it but he looks like an armpit. So full of air, might as well push it. Wait, don't you push drugs, you little shit? What's this boy's name, was it Hendrix? You look pale, better check your rotting appendix. Real talk, we come clean to you, mister. Every single brother here ass-fucked your sister. What?! Hey, hey! Hey! Hey! Take that somewhere else! Fuck you! Stop that! Go away! Stop it! Go away! Good for nothing assholes! Look what you did! Go away! Go, go! Fuck you, I'm onto you! – Go away! – Fuck you! Assholes. Idol! Thank you! I know people will get mad at me for saying so, but the president has been saying this even during his campaign. It's old news, partner. You don't give a dictator a hero's burial; and just fresh from his inauguration? Makes no sense. But before you say anything else, we just received breaking news! – Don’t tell me, it's another demolition. – Yes, partner. Sad to say, this is already the third demolition this month. This time, residents of Barangay 187 are about to clash with the police. Jonard Kintanar is on standby. Ready, Jonard? Asshole, why even bother coming back? Go shit in a bag! I don't feel like shitting. Fucker, you're useless. Why are you even here? If you can't shit, just piss. Connie, hurry! Fucking wait. Useless motherfucker. Go piss, fucker. – Fine. – Put this here. Hendrix! – Hurry! – Coming. Hendrix, hurry up! Oh fuck. Faster! – Fuck. – Oh, fuck! The fuck, I'm not holding that. Bring it yourself. Here. You bring this. Fuck you. Make some noise! Shit! Shit! Shit! You shits! You fucking shits! Shit! Shit! Shit! Let's begin. Just for fun, here we go again, get that nasty rhyming going before you find us dead, face down in the streets, bleeding. Where we're from, you kill or you're killing. You can wait for justice. You can wait for a lawyer. Before you see them, you'll die of famine. I want bread and I know I need my veggies but what I really wanna eat are them big fat melons. – Right, P? – You know Jen? – The daughter of Old Tess? – Who? Why? Got hit at the bakery. She's dead. Fuck. Fuck indeed. What a waste, huh? – A waste. – Didn't she have big boobs? I know. You assholes. It's a waste because she's dead. What a waste because she was an honor student. Old Tess was wailing during the interview: "My daughter is dead. She's dead!" Fuck. Haven't even tasted them. You're really a pervert, man. Pervert! Pervert. Don't be like this fucker. Fucking morons what a waste of melons. That would've been sweet with milk and honey. But, she dead, bro, so— Do you want a baby brother or a baby sister? Brother. Let's eat. Pa? Pa? Pa? Pa? Pa? Son. Are you okay? I'm okay. Have you been taking your medicine? Yes. By the way I brought the deed of sale. Let's eat first. It's not good to have an empty stomach. Where is the land title? We have to find it soon. Do you know where I can have the toilet bowl fixed? Flush doesn't work. What are you still thinking about? Are you planning to rot along with this old house? Son. Son, come on. Son. Son, wait up. Wait for me, son. I have something to give you. Do you have money? Here's for your gas. Grumps is here. Hey, hey! Didn't I just tell you to stay out of here? You're too noisy. Go away! Noisy? Did you say noisy? Noisy? Uh-oh, somebody woke up Grumpy. Your hair is gone, your head is hot and heavy. Your fleas moved up to your armpits because your pubes smells vinegary. Go home, old man or let me just bring you to the cemetery. Hey! Those who don't respect those born before them is the mark of a blockhead buffoon. If you think that's poetry you spout you need a lot more practice, twerp. Out! Go! Nasty. Fuck. Will you stop bugging me? Cunt, I know what you're thinking. What? I told you, we'll just do a few hits. What you really need is me to do you. Hey, Hendrix! Hendrix! Where were you last night? Leave your brother alone. Why can't you be like Mando? He's nothing like me. Motherfuckers. What did you say? I said, "Money." I wanna borrow money. What for, fuckhead? For stupid internet games? Just have to buy shit. Hey. Don't fool me. You think I don't know about you going off to that stupid rap underground? Fuck you. Nobody's taking you seriously there. Nobody. Here. Go on. Deliver this! Fuck. Here you go. Fucker, stop playing hard to get. Bro, did you hear about Boy Pasas? Why? What's up? Whoa, Betchai is concerned! Do you miss your suitor? But hey, no shit. I saw him in the car shop with the cops. Killed. Fuck this. Why now? What do you mean, "Why now?" That fucker still owes me. Mando's gonna kill me. Fuck. Drix, you better watch your back. You could be next. There'd be a sign over your dead body. "Don't be like this pervert!" Hurry up! Let's go! Versus, motherfuckers! What's up? How's it going? Take care of those losers. I can't let you in. Here you go. For the three of us. Losers are not allowed in. What? We're always here! – Let’s just go. – No way! – Come on. – I said no. Here. Bro, are you sure about this? Chill. Here's our chance. There. Let's go. Here's the gun I'm going to hit you with. Kuya Mike, Kuya Mike, who's the next one? Give me the next one. You're next! It's hard for a guy from Los Angeles to get lucky— I mean Angeles, Pampanga. The fucker even stuttered. I'm going to be different tonight. I'm going to fight like Pacquiao. This chinito's gonna look like a Chow Chow. You're not moving ahead. I'm gonna finish you tonight. Make some noise for Abaddon! Since I started going crazy over making music like this I aimed to make a name just like my idols. My sentences are like books, you'll learn so much. From the beginning to the finish, you won't hear a single stupid thing. I'm Abaddon, first of the eight curses. Truth! I'm already at the level you can only dream of reaching. I'm the teacher with a heart that's criminal. A true poet who sets new styles that are lyrical. I've all the traits to make me dangerous. I'm a poet hard to cross because I'm gifted perfected by the time, bedeviled verbs had only small elements to cross them. Vacant minds should be parked in a garage if I catch you, you're in trouble. I'm Abaddon, and no one's more evil, those of you who have nothing to say hold your tongues and stop talking. One, two three. Kid, is this a child's game? Apologies to the kids who pretend they're cannibals, you think they're turning crazy. They try so hard to yelp like animals and work their tongues but they still stutter. And just to join the race they use a voice that always shifts. They hit the ground so many times, what deepened weren't rhymes but wounds they got from falling. It's been a while since I took my rest from being a Twistero I let the words "love" and "respect" explode and happen. It's a big stupidity to think all of you can be us and you can be me. It's like comparing the way I strike you to the way you strike the moon. "It's serious" and "it's becoming serious" are not the same the words "gone" and "missing." I'm living proof that if you sing with all you've got you'll get somewhere and achieve something. It's only now I've proven that people taken down are lucky enough to get back up and those who take shortcuts to the top are the first ones to let go. They lose their way and often never find the way back. Mike Kosa! Before you even start, you'd best learn how to give words so high in quality, you can't erase them. For every newbie and veteran who came before you. There's only one Mike Kosa who brings the rain. In hiphop, everyone turns at his voice shocked by a poet with a knife for a tongue. So please, don't diss. My aim's dead center and I rarely miss. Mike Kosa's fighting bet with OG Birador. He's so massive, he's practically an armoire probably from downing all that Emperador. Each drinking spree, he instigates. He's massive and his beard's badass while DJ B-Boy spins. He's the hardest rapper here. His beard's so thick! Fuck! This one hammers, too. One minute, OG Birador. Choke! Choke! Choke! Fucker choked! Choked! Alright, alright, alright. Place your bets. Wow, so many… The pot money is loaded. Alright, tradition. You know it. Versus, motherfuckers! Make some noise! This battle is like no other; boy versus girl. To my left from Binangonan, Rizal give it up for Jambalaya Rhyme! And to my right apparently someone who's from this hood. No other than… Hendrix. Hendrix! Hendrix! B-Boy, drop that shit. Jambalaya has rhymes with strong appeal but her belly ruins the deal. She's fat but thinks she's so pretty. Your nose is flat and you can't be sexy just because your clothes are skimpy. I heard you went to your JS Prom in a gown. I heard you spent the evening just sitting down. Girl, you overflow with ugly. Your tits are big but so is your belly. If you ask me even if you went naked, I wouldn’t fuck you. Miss Whale, I wouldn't go near you much less ride you. So, go home. Someone call her an Uber. Your panty's the size of Superman's cape. You know the song, "I'm Only Human"? You should make one called "I'm Just a Hippo." Motherfucker! Is this a pig or a wild boar? Your skin's so black, your nape's the color of ash. The color of ash. What do you mean, "Jambalaya"? More like "Jumbo-laya"! Dumbo-laya! All I can say to Jambalaya Rhyme: She's so fat. Time. Alright! The Beauty from Binangonan, Rizal. One minute. Jambalaya attack! Here's the door of the morgue, only the dead can enter. I'll make you feet so level, you'll be like a corpse in a coffin. Don't bother waiting 'cause you're going to die as fast as money disappears from a worker's hands. I never let my favorite TV shows go by. I take it badly. I throw a fit. Then, I'll drag your limp body, you weak faggot. You grate on the ears, you're like bad news. Give up yet? Come here. Why are you trying to be a hero when you're weak? When you got to me, you were already broken. I won't let you pass like a road under construction. You picked the wrong place to pick a fight. Why aren't you fighting? You're weak and a coward. You won't come out alive, you aborted tard. Fuck, the kid's about to cry! Versus, go crazy! Rebutt! The fucker pissed his pants! Pissboy! Pissboy! Fetch the kid his diapers! Asshole! Fuck, enough! Fucker, you think you can fool me? Ungrateful asshole! Are you gonna fight back? Find a way to get my money back! Get out, fucker! And don't come back until you have my money! What's up? Let's go. Where? Keep it down. We have to break in there. – No way. I'm out. – Hey, wait up. Fucker. I'm out. Keep it down, we might get caught. – We? You will get caught. – Come on. Let's go. Fuck you. "Let's go?" I'm not going in there. I'm done with that shit. – Come on, bro. – No way, bro. I hardly ask you for favors! Hardly? Fuck you! Easy, guys. Asshole. You do it. Fuck you. Hold up. Let's talk about this. What's up with you? What's your problem? P, let's just help him. No way. Go home then. Fuck you coward. Go home. You ungrateful chicken. Fuck you! Go fuck yourself. Fuck you, motherfucker! Well? Fuck you, Drix. If I get in trouble, I'll kill you. Hurry up. Why don't you do it? How much long do you need? Fucking wait! What the fuck? I've unlocked it already! Fuck! Fucking disgusting, man. Bro, it spilled on you. Shut the fuck up. This is your fault! Keep it down! They're gone. Don't be so noisy. Hey! Thieves! – Son of a bitch. – Fuck! Thieves! Help! Let's bring them to the police! This is your fault. Do you want to press charges? Go ahead! Ouch! Stop it. I'm not pressing charges. If you don’t press charges we have no reason to detain them anymore. He already said he's not pressing charges! Stop it! Just stop it! Okay, how's this? Let's confiscate their phones. Check that other pocket, I heard a beep. I only have one phone. You won't get your phones back until you fix the bookstore. Finally! Where were you last night? I've been calling you! – Fuckhead. – Enough, enough. So, where's my money? I want my money. Didn't I tell you to not come home until you get back my money? Well? – I left it. – Left it where? Where? – I left it at the… – Where? Let's go. Come here, fuckhead. – Come. – Fuck, go! Hello? Wait! You sound like you want to destroy my door. Sorry, Doc. What is it? I think I left… my money here. That money is… my sister's boyfriend's. Last night. Money? Fuckhead. Are you fucking with me? I'm so sorry, Doc. My brother is really stupid. He might have left it inside. Maybe we could help you look for it? This isn't the amount. How much is it? Eight thousand pesos. Doc, it's only five thousand. Come on. You fucker. You almost got me into trouble. Just stop giving him deliveries. Let him go hungry. I was too little to know how I lost them How the warmth of her bosom went cold; The strong pillar of my home, crumbled. I was nurtured in violence. Dragged and yanked onto the streets. Every bruise, a curse burning in my memory. Why am I in this world? Caught between troubles. I may look like a child, my bones are young but heart and fist can crush stones. What's the big deal? He's not breaking any laws, is he? He's just a dead body that needs to be buried. I think the Yellowtards are overreacting. Move on! But where in the world could a dictator be buried as a hero? Isn’t it our role to guard the victims of Martial Law? It's not right! With all due respect, the day I move on is the day we give up. Like I said, partner instead of uniting the country, it has divided us. Either at least agree on this same thing: We are a divided country. Maybe they were hypnotized to vote for this president. So many lives were claimed to bring down Martial Law. Will this all go to waste in the hands of Duterte? Doc? Good morning, sir. Good morning. Good morning, Doc. Bring that up first. Doc I'm sorry about the other day. Promise I'll pay up when I have money. I told you to bring that up first. Excuse me. Doc, can we take this out first? Okay, okay. This doesn’t look good, Doc. Lemme, lemme. What does this mean? ["Paradox"] Dunno but it's upside down. Hey, bro. I fought with my words to defend and raise my country from destruction. But the blood that flowed became a curse as I lost my beloved son. Asshole. Why be a poet? Asshole. Yo, B! Give me a beat. Why be a poet at all? I fought with my words to defend and raise my country from destruction. But the blood that flowed became a curse as I lost my beloved son. Why be a poet at all if death is the price of a poem? Time to abandon allegories. Toss It all: Stanzas, verses. Deny all intelligence and consciousness. Time to face the real world. Time to close off and make the world small. Time to shut down. There's too much pain. I feel cramped in my dark room. As I closed the door on my poetry I know I jilted my true love. I jilted— Hey, hey! What are you doing? Didn't I tell you to work? Little twerps. Pipe down, says Balagtas. That's Balagtas, the great poet. – I've got something for you, bro. – What's that? What's is it? Take care of it, bro. You fuckers! Why did you swipe that? This is Doc's, right? Aren't you guys guilty enough? Take care of it. Nice. If this gets us in trouble, I'll kill you both. We'll return it. – I'll leave you both there. – Let me study it first. Perv. You guys go ahead. Look at you, lady. So smooth and sexy. Miss, don't get mad at me, please? May I please have your name and I hope it comes with a kiss? Hey! Please get out of here. And you, we have so many customers waiting. Go back inside. Your mom? She wishes. Poor you. Poor me? I saw you at Versus. – Out of all places? – Fuck, really. Hey, please don't piss on me. I'll join again, you'll see. And I'll win. I'm Hendrix. What's your name again? I don't wanna say, I might… You might what? You might fall in love with me? Fuck you. Hard to get, aren't you? Candy! Aren't you coming in yet? Candy. Sweet. Fuck you. – Pa. – Hey. Son, the shelves are falling apart. I'm having them repaired. What for? I already told you, someone's buying this house already. Move. You, over there. There's nothing in there, sir. Did I tell you to speak? What's this? A lighter. Is that nothing? What's the toothbrush for? Are you spending the night? Is there a problem? Is this a problem? How about this, is this a problem? This goes in the trash. Please throw it. I'm sorry about this. Police, in your immaculate blue suit. Formidable in his posture. He brings his talisman, a club and revolver. His hands are so cold, with such composure. The strength to bind with his handcuffs, to lock bars to remove the freedom of any criminal. His righteousness reaches the skies. This man in uniform with a whistle he doesn't have to use but just the mere click of the trigger. He stands tall, but his own shadow is bigger. The nation was shocked with the sudden burial of former president Ferdinand Marcos amid protests. The president may have been buried in the Heroes' Cemetery but it will still be the Filipinos who will determine if Marcos is a hero. – Here. – Thank you. – Here. – Thank you, sir. – Thank you. – Thank you, sir. Bro, look at this. Whoa, nice. Do you still listen to this? Come. Have a seat. What rotten luck Don't you dare drag me into this I'm not part of the riot Damn it This life, I did not choose What rotten luck It's all fucked up I told you not to drag me into this And if you have a go at each other Please have your war some place far What rotten luck Don't you dare drag me into this I'm not part of the riot Damn it This life, I did not choose This is all you have? Boss, you're also from the same 'hood. Are you really asking me why? You know business is hard. Hard or have you been a hard user yourself? Just hard, boss. See for yourself! What I mean, boss is that business is not doing well. Maybe we should relax first. Want some? I want that all done by Tuesday. Hey, hey. Time to pack away because we're just half day today. Nice! Hendrix. You stay behind. Huh? Make sure to pump the wheels of the sidecar. Accompany me to the clinic. Yes, sir. Betchai. Doc. Can I ask a question? You may. You don't say can if you want to ask permission. So can I ask a question or not? Aren't you already asking a question? My sister is sick. If it's possible, can you take a look at her? Only if you can. May I take a look at her! Thank you, Doc! I'm was starting to get worried. I'm not that kind of doctor! What kind of doctor are you? Do you cure crazy people? I think that's what my sister needs. I'm not that kind of doctor either. Instead of yapping and yapping, just keep pedalling and pedalling. Hurry up, it's going to rain. Yes, sir. Hey, Drix. Ya? You have some on you? Negative, bro. Fine, I'll just smoke up. Hey, it's the guy on YouTube who wet his pants! Pissboy! Pissboy! Pissboy! I've been telling you to take care of the title! The buyer backed out already! That was so embarrassing! I have to convince the buyer to change his mind. You better make sure the papers are ready when I get back. – And can you just stop all this reparing nonsense? – The fool's here. Nobody wants to read your stupid, old books! Doc. What's that? I fixed it. I oiled it, and fixed some loose parts and keys. – You can use it now. – Damn it! Damn you, child. I'm already doing you a favor. You bastard. Why meddle with something that's not yours? I already got rid of it. So get rid of it! Man, you wanna… Maybe you'd like to go to Versus. Get in battle. Fucker. Fuck you. Cut it out, guys. I've had enough of Versus. We're broke. Let him battle again. Join again. You scared? Drix, let's go to Versus again? Fuck you. If Doc catches you… Go ahead, call Doc. Mess with his stuff. Fuck. Didn't I just say you can't— Yo. – Go ahead, I'll catch up. – Where are you going? I'll just go to the toilet. Woooh! What's your name? Negatibo? Motherfucker, that will do. It's strange you've made a bet. Brothers, check your pockets. You look like you could be doing time but jaywalking is your only crime. Your face is all good. It's like a cross between a dog and dog food. What do you say, Negatibo? It's curious that curious eyes are really eyes. If people plot to make some noise, I'll give them all black eyes. Don't even try, wall's got no ears, and you couldn't do it. My standards are the highest. I'm a specialist, I bend the rain. My metaphors hit harder than even your police club can. Move aside, bro, you're a mess. It's like your mouth is crapping. Your rhymes are little walls, my rhymes are built like tanks. You're just so lame, you can't play the main game. You're too lame for my A-game. Sign of the cross. Amen. There's Tupac in my brain, and Biggie too. I'm like a new Law Marshall. I kill with Martial law and Kelly's gun, no lethal needle. My rhymes can burn Apollo, I'm not pretending I'm a hero. When Poseidon swan the depths of me, he needed a lifesaver. Alright, alright, alright! Versus! Make some noise, you bastards! From Pandacan is our main man. To my left. The big time MC from Pandacan give it up for Breezy G! And to my right did you wear diapers tonight? Alright in there. Let's make some noise for Hendrix! B-Boy, drop that shit. I destroy everybody when I go live. This newbie won't make it alive. I'll take the lead destroying this mic. Let him take the lead if the line is by height. He just slayed it the last time, so good. He peed his pants. G-Clown, is that you? Do you know the title of his latest single? "Don't Piss Here," literally a jingle. Listen to my verses about an idiot whose balls are so tight, it's inside his ass. Cover your disgusting face. You're cute for a dog. Too bad, you're a boy. Your shorty is more itchy than a rash. She's so itchy, she'd even do it while she's bloody. I'm greedy. I'm selfish. As long as I hold this mic, nobody can take it. Everybody, lookie. He's gonna cry once I'm done. Go home, kid. It's 11 p.m. You have school tomorrow. Pandacan, here you go! Our very own Hendrix! One minute. – Yo. – Man, attack! Strike your killer-rhymer pose all you want. As if you could think a real thought in your head. We all know you get your weapons from foreign acts. So, instead of nonsense, you shoot with foreign lead. Your imitations make me throw up. Your brown brain's been colonized. Western bombs, your mind's blown up. Just follow their leash, you're lobotomized. – Brainless! – BRAINLESS! Yes you're brainless Principle or honor? You're all out. You need to look good So you put up a front and take the cheap and easy route. And whatever you crave, you take and you spend yours and anyone else's cash. And so for your weakness in the end. You steal ideas and money. But, what's more important to you? Money or winning? Winning or respect? Since you stole both, you lost both. You tried to fool the crowd, tell them you're a poet. What do you call someone who fools? Poser! That's right! A poser! Respectful "po" all the time, calling me "Sir." As if he has respect, but his guts are filled with hate. If you take your eyes off him, he'll steal the food off your plate. Let's clap for the poser who endlessly poses. He looks like his cheat sheet is running a bit thin. He says he's a rapper, the crowd whispers "Him?" You look like a loser who pees on the stage. A pretender, not an expert. We'd throw you in the desert. The vultures wouldn't eat you. Your brain is rotten, poison, too. There's nothing fresh about you because you don't have your own voice, fool! That's why you pissed yourself you were so weak your dick cried for you. Fucking asshole. Let go, dude! Why steal from an old man? Hendrix! You get what you deserve. Fuck you. We'll leave you something you won't forget. You giving up? You should've just left me to die. When you're done with all the repairs go ahead and die. Fuck this. Why did I have to meet you? Well. You shouldn't have stolen from me. I was happy in this peaceful house. Happily sulking is more like it. "Happily sulking." Impressive, for a poet who steals. You will never succeed in those rap battles because there is no depth in a man who only aims for applause. What do you know about humanity? You don't even know how to be around people! Your own son doesn't like you! Hey! Don't bring my own son into this! Your son doesn't want you because you're mean! Crazy old fool! Hey kid! What impertinence! I accepted you even if you stole from me and you have the gall to be angry at me? I'm not like you. Turning your life into a drama. And what about you? Why do you look for trouble? I didn't want to be part of the tragedy of the people around me. So, don't tell me I asked for this! While you dally all day staring into space! You spend all your time living in regret all the days. Why don't you become the child so you can change your destiny, Doc? Meanwhile, let me grow old because I'm done fighting and I look forward to dying! You humiliated me! Fuck you! All I've ever wanted was a bit of respect. Is that too much? Really, would it have been your loss if you let me use the words you already tossed away? Was it so bad to make use of them today? Sparkling gems that you threw away? So, destiny gave them to me because you were so busy wallowing. Shouldn't you be flattered? That you're the poet I look up to? And I only did it because I needed hope. And I saw that in you! I saw it in your lines, and your verses and rhymes but if you don't want to fuck you! You can have it! Choke on your trash! Because you really only think of yourself, right? Just what you think and what you feel [nadadama]? Isn't that right? Wrong. "Nadadama" is not a word. You mean "nadaRAma." [feelings] Huh? There is no "nadadama." [feelings] But there is a word for drama. Fuck, Doc. You know who has no nadadama [feelings]? That's you. There is nothing essential to feel to a person whom nothing is essential except for one's own essence. For men who show no respect for rhyme or reason where the essence of words no longer move him. No matter how deep or high the prose will certain fall, unmoved. Unregarded. Drix. Come here. Don't bother him. Deliver this. At the bar. Come on. Give it to this guy. Go. Hand it only to this guy. Hold on. Well, look at that. Alright! Here. Fuck. There. Be thankful Mando knows how to forgive. Instead of texting inside, display yourself outside. Hey. – Candy. – Drix. How are you? What are you doing here? Delivery. Who is it? Do you know… Jograd? Bayagbag? Go ahead; speak up so that everybody can here. What a screwed up name. Like double balls. Where is he? He's in blue. 52. Oh, yeah? You going anywhere? Wait for me. What are you doing here? Looking for trouble? Mando has a delivery for you. I thought you were trouble. Here. This is short. Boys, he says I'm short. Short. Short. I didn't pay enough? Not enough? Still not enough? Is this enough? This smells as sweet as your lyrics. A thief and a pusher. What a joke. Get outta here, fucker, before I beat you up again. You fucking killed my mood. You sure you don't want a drink? Fuck. Jograd Bayagbag? Breezy G's name is shit! You knew! You didn't even tell me! Of course, I did. Don't tell me that that wasn't funny. That's why that fucker's a bully. He's got his balls attached to his name. Fuck. Now you know. – Fuck this. – What? Be thankful that I like you. Or else, fuck. I'd be mad as hell right now. Fuck you. I'm so obvious. No use hiding it. That really could've gotten me in trouble. I wouldn't have rap-battled if it weren't for you. Yeah, right. I'm being honest. Seriously? I just went to battle because I wanted to impress you. If you think about it, I always lose, and that crowd is fucking tough. I'd face anything as long as I don't lose face with you. Here. Do you drink? Not much. You feeling sharp? Doesn't hurt that much. Hendrix what's up, yo! Your item was pure solid. So, drinks are on me. Lay off. Fuck you, snotty boy. Come on, we're even now. Look, we beat you up but you disrespected me, right? I crossed you. You crossed me. We're even. Right, bro? That's what I'm talking about! Join us. I'll take care of you, make sure you're all good with the crew. Hold up, hold up Quiet, everybody. I have something to say. I want to welcome the newest member of the Breezy Crew Hendrix! Hendrix! Cheers! So, Hendrix, we good? Whatever is ours, is yours. Of course, whatever is yours… …is yours? Jackpot! Cheers! Cheers! Waiter? Give me the money. What the fuck— Are you fighting me? Give it to me! Give it to me! Fuck you. Mine. Let me count it first. No, let me! Sit down. Fuck you! I'm going to count it! Is that your money, asshole? I'm useless. I did nothing. I did nothing. Do you want to report to the police? I'm useless. I did nothing. I did nothing. Me, too. I did nothing as well. It was a Sunday. My wife was cooking supper while my eldest son, Migs, was playing. We were discussing what to name our second child. She was already expecting. Then, a knock. There were three of them. Members of the Philippine Constabulary. They forced themselves in. I tried to stop them, and they hit my head with the gun. I woke up to my son's loud cries. He was very scared. I saw Migs. He was gagging from the pages of my book. And my wife was bound. They fell in line and passed her around. They burned her skin with cigarettes while they violated her. I screamed and screamed but I was bound and gagged. I wanted to fight but I couldn't move. I did nothing. They inserted a stick in my penis. They were forcing me to give them names from the movement. But, I told myself there is nothing that can make me give up any information. After they were done raping my wife they gagged Migs again with the pages of my book and they shot him. They panicked. They left us. After the Marcos regime my wife killed herself. One night, while walking home I was with my youngest boy and I saw the policeman who shot Migs. He was walking on the bridge alone. Very drunk. I went nearer to make sure it was him. But, when I approached him he even smiled like he didn't remember. I went blind with rage. I hit him with a stone. I hit him and hit him until there was nothing left of his face. I killed him in front of my child. That man had no chance. I thought killing him would erase my pain. But nothing could. Boss, I'm sorry. I'm really short this time. I'll just give you back what's left. I can't really sell right now. The Captain dropped in last Friday. The Captain's an asshole, right? I was just wondering why we'd be part of the list? I don’t think the Captain is aware that we're good, right? Why would they drop by the house? With a fucking candle! We're tight, right, boss? Boss, want some? What do you think, guys? That balloon looks like a fucking tadpole. That's not a tadpole, that's beansprout. Sure. It's good, right? It's not. So, fix it. And why balloons? When I was 6, I dreamt of going to the moon. See, the balloons are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter. There. You should've placed a rocketship then. Would a six-year-old know what a rocketship is? – I did. – What you knew were balloons, right? That's you. I don't have cable. I think it's good. It still looks like a tadpole. Like a beansprout. Nice, nice. Doc. Please? Cell phone! Cell phone! Cell phone! Fine, fine. But, I'll just give the cell phones later. Isn't it the birthday of Hendrix? Let me treat you to a blowout. Can't you just give the phones now and we'll come back later? I don't want to. – Come on. – You might not show up. This face, Doc, is not going to refuse a free meal. I want to bring you somewhere. We are sad to tell you that we are about to end. In our poetic joust let this be a lesson. Your old school books must now bid adieu. Till next encounter my defeated friend. I almost bought your argument. So good, I thought about building you a monument of Moses with a tablet, playing Pokemon Go. Their visions are starting to lose focus confused by what kind of book to choose. So we'd like to ask for your counsel. Should we let the eBook take over our lives or should old school books be kept alive? To my left let me hear it for old school. To my right eBook. That's it? The people have spoken and we shall hear them. To continue our celebration we call on poet Vim Nadera. I'd like to give praise to our most respected poet. In Pampanga, a krisotan. In Ilocos, a bukanegan. This night is made special with a stellar brightness of a poet who happens to be my dear friend. Let's give a warm welcome to the comeback to Bistro Batute of Fortunato Reyes! It's a good thing you finally showed up. I wanted him to learn different styles of verses. Doc have you written anything new? I'm retired. Don't bother me. It's not important if he has written anything new. What's important is the blowout. Agree! It's this boy's birthday. Well, look at this. All this time, I thought you have lost hope in mankind. Hey. Happy birthday! Happy birthday. Oh, yeah! Thanks, guys. How did you score this? It's from Doc! He didn't have to know! Happy birthday! Thanks, Doc. Oh, before I forget. Here. Your cell phones. Thank you, Doc. Thank you. That's mine. We're good. You're free! Next time don't bother stealing because you'll just fail. You'll fail because you're not bad people. Shit, nobody even looked for me! Nobody loves you. Yeah, whatever. Can I borrow your guitar later? – I want to write. – I'll teach you sometime, no problem. Breezy G, come back again, okay? – Of course. – Thanks. Hold on is this Hendrix? I didn't recognize you. The last time I saw you you were all black and blue. Way before bedtime but the jerk's already asleep. What a fuckhead. Idiot rapper Idiot in cypher. Has to rely on an aged ghostwriter. Come join the lowriders with gramps on your sidecar. You're not made to be a rapper. You'll never find your way; you're too dumb, it doesn't matter. You fight over our leftovers. And your girlfriend, Candy? I licked her good. Where'd you guys come from? Nearby. Where? Nearby. Hendrix, where have you been? Huh? We've been waiting for you. Connie! Yeah? Your brother is here. You motherfucker, where have you been?! Drix. Happy birthday, Hendrix! Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday, jerk! Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday, happy birthday Happy birthday— – to you. – again. Blow. There, happy birthday! Let's eat, let's eat! We've been waiting for you guys! Yay, happy birthday again! Come in. Don't be shy. Hey, Drix. Can you buy us soda? Bro, I'll come with you. You coming? – Yo, bro. – I'm good here. Go, go. Eat as much as you want! Just help yourself. Thank you. So, are you okay? You know what's more okay? Fuck. You'll hear it from Mando again. I'll be fine. It's my birthday. Why are they closing— Why are they closing— Fuck. Bro, run, bro! DOC! Betchai? Hendrix? DOC! Why? Son, wait. Wait. Son, don't! Move, Pa! Son, wait. Wait, wait. – Move, Pa. – Wait, don't. – Son! – Pa, move! Just shoot me! – Move! – Son, wait! I said, move! Wait! I said move— Just shoot me!
