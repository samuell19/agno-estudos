[STATIC BUZZING] AMANDA: What you have to ask yourself is why you do things you don't want to do, things that are bad for you. [HORN HONKS] AMANDA: Good morning, Los Angeles. This is Amanda Grace. What's on your mind? What can I do for you? If you think your husband's having an affair, why don't you just ask him? You have to have honesty and communication in a relationship. Why do you think you have trouble with intimacy? You're listening to Ask Amanda. Our phone lines are open. I think we have an unrealistic view of love in our society. It's like some fairy tale. Look, your depression is nothing more than unexpressed anger. Let's talk about a subject near and dear to all of us, shall we? You might claim to understand it or to have it in perspective. Some even pretend to be above it. But when you get right down to it, aren't we all interested in sex? Yes. Yes! [MOANING] [BOTH PANTING] [BOTH GRUNTING] [BOTH SIGHING] [CHUCKLES] Well... I guess I'll fix us those drinks now. [CHUCKLES] Thanks, that's awfully sweet of you, but I should go. What, are you kidding? It's 3:00 in the morning. I work early. May I use your bathroom? Yeah. It's right there, just past the big comfortable bed. [SIGHS] ♪ Sexual healing, baby ♪ It's good for me ♪ Sexual healing is something that's good for me ♪ Line three, you're on the air with Amanda Grace. BRENDA: Hi, Doctor. My name's Brenda. I'm a really huge fan of the show. Thank you. So, now, what's going on in your life that I can help you with, Brenda? [TELEPHONES RINGING] Hold a second, please. Hold, please. BRENDA: This is kind of embarrassing, but my boyfriend liked to tie me up. He liked to tie you up during sex? Hurrah. [CHUCKLES] BRENDA: Yes. Did he want to do this occasionally or... BRENDA: No. I'd say more often than that. You had a problem with it? You like to be tied up? Great. Yeah, we'll put you on next. Tell me something, Brenda. Do you feel in control of your life? BRENDA: I-I don't know. Sometimes. Sometimes I don't. But I-I don't... I don't see what that has to do with anything. I don't think being tied up bothers you because it's kinky. I think the reason it troubles you is because it brings out all your old feelings of powerlessness. BRENDA: I read in a magazine... Don't change the subject. Stay with me. Stay with the feeling. Feeling powerless makes you uncomfortable, doesn't it? Look. That guy's got my book. Honey, a lot of people are going to have that book. Stop looking at his ass. Why should I? You should take a peek yourself. I'm pretty sure he's not wearing underwear. Yeah, well... Could at least be subtle. You'll live, okay? You don't have to seduce all of them, you know? You make it sound like I have no taste. Oh, no, no, no, kiddo. It is not a matter of taste. It is a matter of appetite. So I've got a healthy appetite. Well, it's going to get you in trouble one of these days. Besides, there are a lot of inquiring minds that are very curious about your private life. Sasha, you are so paranoid. I could help you with that, you know. Ha-ha. Now, look, I'm serious. People listen. People watch. You know... Excuse me, Ms. Grace? I hate to bother you, but... Of course. I never miss your show. Oh, thank you. I'm sorry to bother you. It's no bother. Take care. [SIGHS] Okay. Okay. You are not invisible anymore. Look, Sasha, I love you, but just manage my career, okay? I'll manage my life. [KEYBOARD CLACKING] No, I can't use that. I don't know. Maybe... 'cause I'm Catholic. Sometimes the guilt... I can feel it eating away at me. Right here. My stomach. In my guts. It's a very destructive emotion, guilt. That's what I just said. What I need to know is what can do about it? You can start by forgiving yourself. Some things are easier to forgive than other things. Could we close the blinds? Of course. Thank you. Thanks a lot. Hi. Hi. I really loved your first book. I can't tell you how much it's helped me. Thank you. I'm glad. What's your name? Sharon. There you go. Thank you. Take care. Hi. WOMAN: Hi. What's your name? Amie. A-M-I-E. Thank you. Thank you. Hi. I know you, right? Do you? I'm thinking we've met before. No. No, we've never met, but you get that feeling sometimes, don't you? You meet a total stranger and feel instantly connected. Who should I inscribe this to? Oh, it's already inscribed. You're very confident. That's nice. I'm not nice. I'm a lot of things, but I'm not nice. I'd like to see more of you. I'm afraid that's impossible. Thanks for buying the book. Hi. Who's this for? Hi. How are you? My niece Anne. Resourceful as well as confident. Why am I not surprised? I'm full of surprises. Amanda, darling! Robert, darling. I was just about to start worrying. Don't be silly. I'm exactly on time. That's why I said &quot;about&quot; to start worrying. I brought a friend. How do you do? Nice to meet you. Come along now. There are a lot of people for you to meet. [CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] All right. You've got my curiosity piqued. Who are you? The name's Mick. Stoli on the rocks with two olives, please. I'm beginning to wonder how far you're going to take this. You make it sound like I'm the only one in control here. You know better than that. ROBERT: I want to know all about it. Tell me, it was painless, wasn't it? Painless? You know how I feel about book signings. How do you feel about dollars, lots and lots of dollars? [LAUGHS] Robert... You have a wonderful house here. Thank you very much. I'm glad you like it. I'd love a tour if you have a minute. Well, uh... Well, maybe Amanda could show me around. I suppose. I'm sure you could use a break from all of this pressing the flesh. Oh, I don't think it's... Great. Great. Thank you. Let's start upstairs, shall we? By the way... I caught your show today. You didn't like it. I thought it inconsequential, a lot of empty talk. I mean, do you really think you have an effect on their lives, all those neurotics? So many unhappy people? It's not my responsibility to make people happy. Yes, but that's what they think when they call. Instant cure. Take an Amanda pill. So what's wrong with a little instant gratification? Excuse me? An Amanda pill. What's so bad about that? Well, it's wrong to offer people false hope. It's not false, and what else is there to offer people but hope? Freedom. I could offer you that. Freedom always comes at a heavy price. What if I'm not willing to pay? There's nothing to pay. It's a gift. [AMANDA MOANING] I can't. I can't. Yes, you can. No. No, no, no, no. Okay. Just let me touch you with one finger. Just one? Just one. Hey, hey. What? That's two fingers. Who's counting? [AMANDA MOANS] [MOANING] [MOANING] [EXCLAIMING] [SIGHS] [SIGHS] Amanda understands that you need her to promote the book. She just did a book signing for you, didn't she? You know how she feels about those. Christ, she'd rather bungee-jump without a rope. Yes, but this promotional tour's only five cities. Doesn't matter. It would boost sales tremendously. [LAUGHS] Robert, what can I tell you? She refuses to take any more time away from her private practice. Maybe I'll have to get down on my knees and beg. Yeah, you give that a try. Hey, kiddo. I'm so sorry I'm late. No problem. You look lovely. Thank you. So what did you think? Oh, beautiful. Beautiful. A lot of nice touches, wouldn't you say? Thank you. I'm glad you like it. Uh, I didn't catch your name. It's Mick. Mick, this is my manager Sasha Taylor. It's a pleasure to meet you. Oh, I'm charmed, I'm sure. I'm afraid I have to run. Thank you for a wonderful evening. And thank you. My pleasure. Good. I'll show you out. Good night. Oh, good evening. What? Oh, you're an animal. I know. [KEYBOARD CLACKING] [INTERCOM RINGS] Yeah? WOMAN: There's a gentleman here to see you. Does he have a name? He won't give it to me. Then I'm busy. Wait. Is he still there? WOMAN: Yeah. Send him in. You were right. Ms. Grace said to go right in. I didn't expect to see you again after that disappearing act last night. Disappointed? I'm not saying. What are you doing here? I want something. Of course. I knew there'd be a price to pay. Oh, no, this is free too. It just requires a little bit of your time. Time is something I have precious little of these days. It's because you're a workaholic. So? So what are you doing this afternoon? Another photo shoot. Mmm. Sounds like a party. Exactly. Things are closing in on you, aren't they? More meetings, more appointments. That makes it very convenient for you, doesn't it? It ensures that you'll be the pursuer and not the pursued. Oh, there's nothing convenient about you. You're definitely high-maintenance. So why see me again? I like the way you come. Cancel your photo shoot. No. Nice place you've got here. Thank you. How long have you had it? Not long at all, really. You know, if I were the inquisitive type, I'd say something like, pretty large for a bachelor, don't you think? Hmm. Perceptive and prying all at the same time. It is large, but it's temporary. You could've just bought me lunch. Really? You know a restaurant where we can sit on the counters and fuck on the tables? You think that's what I want? Yeah, I do. How do you know? MICK: I don't know. Intuition, I guess. You seem to intuit a lot about me. It's not hard at all, really. I just have to look very deeply into your eyes. And touching my thigh. Does that tell you anything? No. It just turns me on. You're going to burn the veggies. We'll order in. [CREAKING] What was that? The garage door, I think. Don't tell me. It's your wife. No, no, there's no wife. Well, then, who is it? The guy who lives here, I'd imagine. What? You should've seen me play Howie today. [CHUCKLES] I aced him so much, he looked like he was playing tennis underwater. Smells good, baby. You got a letter here from your mother. I hope she's not bringing that dog. What's her name? Sonya? She messed up a rug. I've to go out and buy a new rug. Okay, baby. Hey, I'm going to go take a show... Teresa! Who's here? Who's here? Well? What? What just happened? What was that supposed to be? Foreplay. That was a pretty stupid stunt, you know. Oh, I know. He could've had a gun. That's true. He could've. It was a stupid and adolescent thing to do. You're absolutely right. I can't believe I'm sitting here with a guy who would do something like that. Neither can I. Really, I mean it. I know you do. This doesn't mean that I'm still not upset. I understand completely.

How may I help you? Messages for 517, please. I'm sorry. There are no messages, Mrs. Burroughs. Thank you. What are you doing? I was... You scared me. I was just checking my messages. Came here straight from work. So, did you figure anything out? What do you mean? Oh, come on. You had to have looked around a little. Maybe a little. Well, ordinarily that would be a good move, figuring out a man by what he carries, but I'm afraid in my case, it's a dead end. Not at all. Your clothes are all new and expensive. Some haven't even been worn yet, and you've bought everything from stores here in LA. So? So obviously you're not from here. and you're new to town. The hotel room should've tipped you to that. Not necessarily. A lot of people have liaisons in hotel rooms. That doesn't mean they live there. You live here, which raises other questions. Oh, really? Like what? Where you're from, how can you afford this place and these clothes, and why does someone who lives out of a suitcase not have a suitcase? Good questions. What do you think? Maybe you had to leave somewhere in a hurry. Maybe you were forced to go and so you had to leave your things behind. Jealous husband, something like that. Nice try, but no. Maybe you just don't hold on to anything for very long and therefore don't value anything all that much. Much better. Give me more. You're nomadic by nature and probably by necessity. My guess is you're some sort of upscale hustler. [APPLAUDING] Bravo. Now take off your clothes. [LAUGHS] You're getting a bit overconfident, don't you think? I won't ask you again. Leave those. Get on the bed. What are you going to do? Spank me? Maybe. Give me your hands. Now... do you want me to fuck you? Yes. Beg me. Fuck me. Fuck me now. Hey, I got a surprise for you, kiddo. Oh, yeah? What's that? Well, I just got you the interview on Wake Up, LA. You are taping in the morning. That's great. Hey, wait a minute. Give me something. How about, uh, &quot;That's terrific, Sasha. &quot;You're a wonderful manager, Sasha.&quot; I'm sorry, Sasha. My mind is elsewhere. Oh, yeah? What's his name? Mick. Mick? You mean Mick, Mick? Are you seeing him again? Mmm-hmm. Well, that's... twice, isn't it? When is the wedding? [WHISTLING] [MOANING ON TV] MICK: Come on. Come on. Come on, let's see your face. [BOTH GRUNTING] Hello, asshole. Well, what do you know, Dino? Video equipment. You're up to your same old tricks, huh, Mick? Arms out. Come on. Is this necessary? Shut up. Got out pretty quick, huh? Yeah, time off for good behavior. We need to talk, Mick. I'd love to, but you guys look like a couple of criminals, and I wouldn't want to violate the terms of my parole. Yeah? I wouldn't want to violate your fucking face. Come on, let's go for a ride. Let's not. Oh, no. Let's. Mr. Stone wants his money back, Mickey. It's not his money. It's mine. Mr. Stone doesn't see it that way. Well, obviously, you fucking moron. Mr. Stone has to account for that cash to his partners. You know that. If you just give the cash back, Mr. Stone says all is forgiven. Let me tell you something. No matter who gets the money, all is not forgiven. Your boss set me up, and I did time for it. Nothing gets forgiven. You got that? Seems to me like you're in no position to be talking like that. Yeah, well, it seems to me you're in no position to be walking erect. Suddenly he's not so witty. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Six times. Six times what? What are you talking about, six times? Last night. Six. Oh. Six times? In one night? Mmm-hmm. Oh God. I don't even have the strength to get up and pee in the middle of the night. It's more than just the sex. He excites me, you know? Challenges me. I never know what's gonna happen next with this guy. [GRUNTS] [GRUNTS] Painful, huh, Mick? [GROANING] You know, I'd rather not put you through this, Mickey. I'd have killed you right off, man, but Stone needs his money back. Are you starting to grasp that now? Okay. What? Okay. You tell Mr. Stone... Yeah? That I fucked his nephew Bobby in prison, and he liked it. [MICK GROANING] He's out. Great! Now what's he gonna tell us? What was he telling us before, huh? Dino, go get some water, please. We'll bring him around and we'll start over again, all right? Go on! Where the fuck am I going to find water around here? Just couldn't play the game right, could you, Mickey? Ah, fuck! Mick, man, talk to me now, man. Talk! Fuck! Hey, look, man, I'll tell Stone anything you want me to tell him, man. Fuck you! Yeah, fuck you, man! Oh, yeah. I'll kill you, Mick. I'll... John! Hey, Dino.

Are those for me? [CLICK] I think I better be going. I think you've got the wrong idea here. Mick, don't even fucking try. Look, I haven't touched her. I bought her for you. What do you mean, you bought her for me? Exactly what I just said. Maybe it was a mistake, but I thought you'd be into it. You're the one who's into it. At least be honest. You'd like to watch, wouldn't you? Well, I won't deny that. I don't believe this. Look, if it makes you feel any better, she's not a streetwalker. She comes from a very reputable agency. Oh, come on. Don't tell me you've never thought about it, what it might be like with another woman, especially one who knows what she's doing. Untie her. She's not tied, she's cuffed. Then uncuff her. No. Don't you touch me. I know you want this. And you're strong enough to handle it. I know you better than anyone. I can look right into your soul. Did you know that? And I know what your body wants, things that your mouth can't even articulate. You do know that, don't you? You were wrong. I'm not strong as you thought. [SIGHS] We've taken this as far as I am willing to go. It's over. Do you understand? MICK: Yeah, I understand. But I don't agree. You are mistaken if you think it's over. [SCOFFS] It is over.

Thanks. Mmm-hmm. Oh, it must be Wake Up LA. Well, let's take a look, huh? Holy shit! Oh, Jesus! Not a word to anyone about this, you hear me? Listen, I'll take it to the grave. It's okay. How did you get in here? I can get in anywhere. You should know that by now. I got your message. I don't understand! I took the tape out of the camera myself. I destroyed it. I was making a dub in the wardrobe at the same time I was taping you. You're diabolical! I can't help it. I'm a career criminal, it's my nature. I'm sure you're familiar with the character type. You know, it's funny. I wouldn't have minded if you were just a criminal. But blackmail? You might as well be a rapist. Well, you see, that's where we disagree. I prefer to think of myself as a... a guardian angel. I watch over people. I see their every move. All those hypocrites who talk one way and act another. All those people out there who do their dirty little deeds behind closed doors and then pray that no one finds out. You know, if people just lived honestly, there'd be no need for blackmail. You heard of paying for your sins? Well, consider me the bill collector. I'm not rich, you know. I don't want your money. Then what do you want? I'll let you know. WOMAN: I'm sorry, there's no answer. Would you like to leave a message? No, thank you. No message. [BELL CHIMES] [BELL CHIMES] [AMANDA GASPS] MAN: Hey! You're Amanda Grace, aren't you? Yes. Yes, I am. Listen, I called your show a few months ago about this problem I have with my mother. I'm having trouble getting started... Excuse me. I'm in a bit of a rush. I'm sorry. [BANGING] Fuck! [EXHALES] Gotcha. Oh, hi. I know the way. RECEPTIONIST: Excuse me, you can't go back there, sir. Sir, she's not seeing anyone today. [DOOR OPENING] Thank you for coming. Well, all right. It's your meeting, so you set the agenda. I want to buy the master copy of that tape and any other dupes you might have made. I told you, I don't want your money. I think you do. I'm impressed. I thought you might be. Even more impressive. Will you consider my offer? I guess I'll have to. All right, I've considered it. And? And you can keep the money. I've never objected to a woman holding the purse strings. Since you really want that tape, I'm sure we can still work something out. You're sick. You need serious counseling. You think so? Are you kidding? Well I think it's bullshit. Psychological counseling, it's a lot of nonsense. Its whole aim is to socialize the individual, right? Well, I don't want to be socialized. I'm perfectly happy the way I am. There's still the law, you know. I can go to the police. Go ahead. And take your copy of the tape with you. [PANTS] Damn stairs are going to be the death of me. Oh, God. I'm being blackmailed. What? I know. But, I mean... with what? There's a video. What? A sex tape. Of you? I'm with a woman. I'm having sex with a woman. Who's the woman? A prostitute. Oh, my God. Amanda... I mean, that's illegal, no matter what. There could be some charges, I guess. And? And there's some... bondage involved, I think. You think? Amanda, you have to be very clear about all of this. I know. I'm sorry. She was wearing handcuffs, but I didn't put them on her. Who... Who would do this? Who has the tape? My new boyfriend. Oh, honey, I'm... I'm sorry. Never mind all this. What am I gonna do? Pay him. Pay the bastard. He doesn't want money. I don't know what he wants. What do you mean? He's blackmailing you, and he doesn't want money? Uh-uh. Look, this is serious. We're gonna have to talk to the police about this. No. I don't want to go to the police. You're late. This place is pretty hard to find. A bit dramatic, don't you think? Ah. I see. You're a devious bastard. That's why I can do what I'm about to do. You're going to kill me? The world will be a better place without you. Well, I'm moved by your altruism, but I'm not sure I agree. In any case, it won't be a better place for me. You know, I'm sure you're not a very good shot, and I'm awfully far away. Hold it right there! Just trying to be of help. I said hold it! [THUNDER RUMBLING] Stop! There you go. I think... you've given me a hard-on. That's the second time this week I've been hit with a gun. Doesn't anybody shoot anymore? Huh? [GASPING] How's that? There is something between us. You know that? It's okay. It's okay. [SOBBING QUIETLY] It's okay. [PANTING] AMANDA: Tell me something. Sure. Even if it's just this once, I want the truth. All right. All along... this has all just been part of your plan, right? You've been manipulating me from the very start. You really want to know? Yes. I wanted you every time. In the beginning, I had to hold myself back. And now what do you want from me? I'm very interested in a certain client of yours. A patient. Actually, you've only had a few sessions with him. He only comes in very late at night. I bet you don't know much about Jasper Stone. I bet he doesn't tell you much at all. Well, he's a mobster. He's very well-connected, and he's the reason why I spent a few too many years away from society. What? You're saying he set you up or something? Three years of my life wasted in a cage. That explains why you have such trouble playing with the other kiddies. Yeah, I suppose it does. Tell me something. Have you ever heard of doctor - patient privilege? Oh, don't pull that tired old cliche out of the closet, please. I'm serious. I categorically refuse to betray a patient's confidence, no matter who he is. You're missing the point, Amanda. I don't want to blackmail him. I want him dead! And to help cause his death, I need information that only you can get. You know, if you were a real tough guy, you'd kill him yourself. Not if I want to stay alive. You see... as much as I would like to, if I kill Jasper, then his partners will eventually kill me. However... if Stone's business partners can be convinced that poor Jasper is unstable, well, they'll get very, very nervous. You see, Stone knows too much. He can take a lot of important men down with him. If they think he's having a nervous breakdown, if they think that he's an accident waiting to happen, well... they'll take care of the job for me, and I go riding off into the sunset. You're leaving an awful lot up to chance. Listen, you know neurotics. I know gangsters. Trust me. It'll work out. I brought you a present. Go ahead. Open it. Nice, huh? The bug is right there. Get Stone as close to it as possible, but be discreet. How do I know that this is all I'll have to do to get the tape back? You have my word as a gentleman. So how are you, Amanda? Well, thank you. And you? Well, I'm...good. Good. I believe that last week... we were discussing guilt. Right. Are you okay? Yes. You seem upset. I'm fine. Okay. Guilt. [SIGHS] Guilt. I guess what I never... You were saying? Saying that I guess guilt is a... terrible burden to bear, then. Each day I thank the Lord my conscience is clear. Why don't we talk about your relationship with your sister? I'm going to have to cut this session short. I have some business to take care of. I'll walk you out. Thank you for that. It speaks highly of your character. I'm going to have to know who planted the bug, of course. I'm very serious, Amanda. I need to know who it is. Listen, I did you a favor, but I'm being blackmailed myself, so I can't give you his name at the risk of exposing myself. Okay, you did me a favor. I'll do you one. You have 24 hours to give me the name of the responsible party. 24 hours, Amanda, or else. AMANDA: Why don't we talk about your relationship with your sister? STONE: I'm going to have to cut this session short. I have some business to take care of. AMANDA: I'll walk you out. Is that all he had to say? Yes. I told you. it's taking me a long time to draw him out. Let me try this one. STONE: Thank you for that. It speaks highly of your character. I'm going to have to know who planted the bug, of course. But how did... Oh... I put a second bug on you. Just in case. How clever of you. Now, this... This, Amanda... This upsets me! [GLASS BREAKS] You betrayed me. I couldn't do it! I can't be an accessory to murder. I will not help you kill that man! Now what? I said now what? [WHISTLING] [PHONE RINGS] Yeah? MAN: Dr. Grace? Who's this? I'm calling for your comment on the videotape. Huh? Do you have a comment on the sex tape, Doctor? I'm afraid you have the wrong number. [GASPS] Oh, no. [PHONE RINGS] No comment. SASHA: It's me, kiddo. Sasha, how bad is it? SASHA: Pretty damn bad. Turn on your TV. MAN: [ON TV] Oh, no! No! Rocking in the wake of the latest celebrity sex-tape scandal. The celebrity in question is psychology maven and self-help author Amanda Grace, whose latest book is entitled Guilty Pleasures. While the source of the tape remains ambiguous, its contents certainly do not. Grace is shown in acts of lesbianism and bondage with an unnamed female. The broadcast affiliate which airs Miss Grace's radio talk show has declined to comment on the scandal, and Miss Grace has yet to issue a statement. SASHA: Don't worry about this, kiddo. We won't take this lying down. We'll sue... Sasha, I'm going to have to call you back. TV PRESENTER: Coming up next on E!, Stay tuned for Talk Soup.

Well, you're certainly entitled to your opinion... But let me say right now that I'm not ashamed of anything I've done, and that includes that tape. I may regret that it's gone public, but just like you, I'm a sexual being, and I accept that fact. [GASPS] Oops! I'm sorry. I'm looking for the guest who's staying here. Um, this room is vacant, Miss. AMANDA: How are we doing? SASHA: Well, it's a mixed bag. The upside is that your book is selling off the shelf, and I'm talking blockbuster. Downside is that Wade, that spineless prick of a station manager, he's decided to pull the show and run your old tapes till all this mess dies down. Nothing I can do about that right now. Anything else? Yeah. I love what you did on your show today. Thanks. Thanks for being a friend, Sasha. You need anything, I want you to call me. We're going to weather this storm. Listen, kiddo. You're stronger than you know. Hello? Hello? I know you're in here. You're usually more clever than this. Oh, I think I'm pretty clever. Where are you going, lady? Ow! [GRUNTING] Hey! Your time's up. Mr. Stone says he needs a name from you. Fuck you. You watch your tongue, bitch. Or I'll cut it out. I'm sorry. I've had a rough day. I'd be glad to help Mr. Stone any way I can, but I will only speak with him in person. Now, are you going to take me to him or not? That won't be necessary. I'm happy to come to you. Let's have a seat. You got a nice place here. Just wait in the car. Go on. Go on. Sit down. I have been watching the tube. You had some trouble today. Nothing I can't handle. Well, enough of the fucking pleasantries. You got a name for me or not? I don't know his name. I figured you'd say that. You know what your trouble is? You got a healthy conscience. You didn't have to protect me. You sure as hell don't have to protect this other guy. I'm not. I'm just trying to protect myself. STONE: You think I'm going to hurt you? I'm not going to hurt you. I tell you my deepest, darkest secrets. You know me. No, I don't. I don't really know you at all. Well, you're just going to have to trust me then. I don't trust people just because they demand it. Look, I think you got the wrong impression here. This is not like our usual meetings where I'm asking you for advice. I'm asking you for a name. Now, who is this guy? WOMAN: Well, his job takes him out of town a lot. He's always on the road. Well, believe me, I know how that can be. I'm just surprised, that's all, Mrs. Armstrong. I don't see how any man could go away and leave you for weeks at a time. Pardon me, sir. This note was left for you at the concierge. Thank you. Thank you, sir. I'm sorry. Something has come up that requires my immediate attention. [SIGHS] AMANDA: Don't turn around. Aah! Aah! What did I just say? Have you lost your fucking mind? Yes. Believe me, I know the symptoms. Well, what do you want? I'll let you know. But for now, you're coming with me. You know, you don't need the gun anymore. I'm going with you willingly. I'll be the judge of that. So how did you find me? I saw a brochure of the resort that night I went through your stuff. How sloppy of me. I got your last name from the hotel operator. And when I got here, I tipped the bellboy $100 of your money. I hope you don't mind if I take the credit for educating you. In more ways than one. Turn onto that dirt road up ahead. Pull over here, and turn off the engine. All right, now what? Put 'em on. [SCOFFS] I don't think so. Aah! Aah! I do wish that you would stop doing that. Put them on. Okay. Okay. If only to save what's left of my hearing. Just like old times. I knew it was you, Mick, you fucking weasel. You don't know what you're doing. Yes, I do. They'll kill me. I know. Here he is, signed, sealed, and delivered. Well done. Good for you. Good for you. Step out of the car, please. Old Vince here used to be a cop. [COCKS GUN] Get on your knees. You don't want to do this. Get down on your fucking knees! You're making a big mistake. It's a waste to whack me. I'm a resource. Shut up. [GRUNTING] You're not coming back this time, Mick. [BREATHING HEAVILY] [COCKS GUN] [UNCOCKS GUN] Here's the money. Remind you that this is my money in the first place. Minus his expenses, I'm sure. We're even. All of us. Not quite. Dispose of them. Hold on here. We had a deal. I pay for him, you scare him a little. That's all. I don't make deals. I'll give you a choice. You want to die now, or you want to watch this scumbag get it first? Do it. Him first. [GRUNTS] Aah! [COCKS GUN] I'm not moving. I'm not doing anything you don't tell me to do. Any ideas? Kill him. Shut the fuck up! You shut the fuck up, you fuck! Shut up! Don't! I'm just... just waiting here for you to tell me what to do. AMANDA: Okay, what we're going to do is get the police out here. Well, maybe we could discuss that. Amanda, You don't know Jasper. I do. You'll never be safe as long as he's alive. You don't know Amanda, hotshot. She's got compassion. She's not going to shoot an unarmed man. You don't have the balls to shoot me. It was for the best, really. You'll thank me one day. Drop the gun. Uh-uh. [RETCHING] It's okay. It's okay. [AMANDA COUGHS] Heard your radio show yesterday. It's good. Really good. I like that whole new direction the show's taking, you know? Aah! [TIRES SCREECH] What was that all about? Are you thinking what I think you're thinking? I doubt it. Get out of the car. No. Come on. We've played this game before. I'm not playing. You seem to be forgetting that this is my car. I stole it, anyway. Don't forget your money. Thanks. And thanks for saving my life. Don't kid yourself. I was saving mine. You could have let him shoot me first. I probably should have. Need a loan or something? I don't want your blood-money. Well... suit yourself. See ya. No, you won't. What are you losing? Something that doesn't satisfy you. Let him go. That's better than losing yourself, isn't it? WOMAN: But I don't know if I can handle being alone. I don't know if I'm strong enough. You're strong enough. Sure, you'll hurt for a while, but you'll survive. And believe me, it's a good feeling to find out you're a survivor. You know, we're all a lot tougher than we give ourselves credit for. We all have tremendous reserves of strength. Sometimes you just don't know until you're challenged. All I can do is encourage you to make a change in your life. Well, that's all the time we have today. Thanks to everyone who called. You've been listening to Ask Amanda. Respect yourself.
