COUP D'ÉTAT A film directed by Kijû Yoshida One... two... Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten. Produced by Kinshiro Kuzui & Kijû Yoshida Screenplay by Minoru Betsuyaku Cinematography by Motokichi Hasegawa Starring: Rentaro Mikuni Yasuo Miyake, Akiko Kurano Tadahiko Sugano, Masako Yagi, Yasuyo Matsumura Kei Iinuma, Masao Imafuku, Kazunaga Tsuji, Taketoshi Naito Are you sure he's your brother? He checked his victim was dead by putting a hand under his nose. And then he committed suicide. He had a knife, but cut his throat with a razor. The murdered man is Zenjiro Yasuda, head of the Yasuda financial cartel. He was 84 years old. He was stabbed in the right chest and twice in the face with a 24-cm knife. He tried to escape but was stabbed in the throat. That was the death blow. He said nothing to you? Actually... ...he spoke of counting to ten before acting... He said something of the sort. What did he mean by that? "Before acting, count to ten." Count to ten? "One, two, three, four..." It calms your nerves. Our father often said this to him before he passed away. Can't you tell me exactly how he said it? "Before acting, count to ten." They were his words. May I go now? Well, just wait a moment. Hail to the Mystical Lotus Sutra and the Buddha of Compassion... There's someone here to see you. From the Imperial Household Agency? You have sent seven copies of the Lotus Sutra to the Crown Prince. You are Ikki Kita, am I correct? We would like you to accept this receipt on behalf of His Highness. There's someone here to see you. It's his wife. Heigo Asahi? This way, please. Heigo Asahi is the one who stabbed Zenjiro Yasuda. Yes, sir. Why have you come to see me? Because it was written in his will. What was written? To deliver this to Ikki Kita. Is that all? Yes, sir. I've spoken to the police about the matter. They advised me to deliver it. That's what the police told you, to deliver it? Yes. And your parents...? I don't have any. There's just me and my younger brother. And what did your brother say about this current matter? Nothing. He didn't say anything to me. My brother and I, we live separately. But... What? The last time I saw him, he said to me, "Before acting, count to ten." "Before acting, count to ten"? Was that before the stabbing? "Finally, to my faithful friends: "Always guard my principles, "without words, without clamour, without denunciations. "In silence, stab, slash, cut, shoot. "Between friends, there's no need for pacts. "It is enough to kill one person. Do your best. "The time for the revolution is ripe. "If we can foment revolution in many places, "it will not be difficult to obtain support." Even if his testament is different, it's obvious that he'd read your book, Outline Plan for the Reorganisation of Japan. It's not my book, Nishida. I wrote it for you. I realise that. One can feel... ...that, before acting, he counted to ten. Counted to ten? Exactly. They are many ways to calm oneself. Many? That's not true. This method he invented. Exactly. This is the method that he invented. His actions will result in the imposition of martial law. Martial law? In order to dignify their actions, he wants to increase the danger. And that is martial law. Not again, surely? Why don't you just drop the case? - Why? - It stinks. Get him up. Bring him to the house and look after him. - May I help you? - I'd like to see your master. The master? The gentleman who's director of the Mitsui financial cartel. And who shall I say is calling? - Tell him Kita is here. - Mr. Kita, I understand. One moment, please. Thank you. It's a very useful machine. But sometimes it's ineffective. This machine can whisper, but it cannot scream. A few days ago, the head of the Yasuda cartel, Zenjiro Yasuda, was killed. This is what the assassin, Heigo Asahi, sent me. It has come into my possession. I thought your father, the director, would also like to see it. I see... The director isn't here, I take it? That doesn't matter. Please take a closer look. After killing Yasuda, Heigo Asahi killed himself by cutting his throat. Therefore, that is the blood of Yasuda mingled with the blood of Heigo Asahi. You can smell it. Try a whiff. I see... It's the smell of Heigo Asahi's life. He detested the financial cartels. And not just him. It seems the number of people who hate the cartels is growing. I think it would wise for you to be mindful of this. Has Iwasa of the Secret Police arrived? No. I've been wondering why Heigo Asahi contacted me. I did not know the man. Not once have I met him. It seems that he had read my book and become very passionate. But that's another matter entirely. Nevertheless, he had this sent to me. Why was that? Well... I understand Heigo Asahi. I must share responsibility for what happened. In this world, there are many unsophisticated yet sincere persons like Heigo Asahi. And I must understand that people, even in good faith, will make mistakes. I've said too much. If you don't mind, I'll take that back, thanks. Wait a moment, please. I understand what a difficult situation you have found yourself in. There isn't much, but please accept it. I understand. Thank you. I'll leave you this as a receipt. Master? You must be careful. They're mobilising. Who are? The Secret Police have men everywhere. I know that. They've all read your book, Outline Plan for Reorganisation..., and they've begun to plot. Please be very careful. This situation is dangerous for you, master. Dangerous? Of course it's dangerous. It's more dangerous for me than you can imagine. I know who my enemies are. When I returned from Shanghai in 1920, I dedicated a set of Lotus Sutras to the Emperor. I accepted a receipt, and it was then that I noticed nothing was written on it. Do you follow me? It represented a taciturn acceptance of my challenge to the government. Daiki! - It's so dark in here. - Yes, I've closed the shutters. Why? The shade calms my nerves. Why is Daiki killing insects? He's full of hatred, that boy. Hatred? Why is that? Stop that! What's wrong? Do it later. He expresses dislike well, but it's out of fear. Perhaps it's because Daiki fears something. - You're to blame. - Me? Last night, you had a nightmare again. Is that so? Last night, I dreamt about the Emperor. The Emperor? I was the Emperor. What are you doing? It's retribution. Whenever I was afraid as a child, I would be punished. On the island where I was born, that's how they made their children strong. Yes... Call Daiki here. I shall punish him. Understand, Daiki? Your father was a Chinese revolutionary. I was also a revolutionary. And I still am. All great men are revolutionaries. Understand, Daiki? Revolutionaries are not just those men that bring about the revolution, but those that support it. Come. Look, Daiki. This is our world. There are so many people, and everyone does what they believe is right. Anyway... Look well. They're not right at all! They all act separately, lacking any coordination, and in their incoherence, they feel uneasy. They all hurry about with still so much eagerness. You may realise that you're making a mistake... ...but you never know how you're making it. Just look. Soon it'll be noon. And soon martial law will be established. Martial law descends. Of course, no one will notice. They will make mistakes, as usual. However, do you realise? They will make their mistakes with dignity. But with martial law, every small incident and error shall attain a certain dignity. Because martial law imposes order on disorder. Martial law does not grant the people structure. It casts out structure that is embedded in the disorder of mankind. And people shall notice. They shall notice the order that resides within them. And then, perhaps... ...they will stop and look to the skies... ...so as to make sure that martial law has created order within them. And once they're sure, they will see the Emperor, they will realise that the Emperor can also exist there. And then, perhaps, they will feel deeply moved. In that moment, all will be forgiven. Understand? In this way, our revolution will be realised. Firstly, a soldier must be loyal. Secondly, people who consider the West better than Japan, they are not patriots. Therefore, a soldier who is not patriotic cannot exist. A soldier must devote all his heart to the State. For someone who is skilled in the arts or other studies is nothing more than a puppet. As much as an army can be trained, if it shows no loyalty in war, it is nothing more than a mob out of control. The law of the State depends on its military force. The essence of military force resides in the pure heart of its army. Do not listen to the people's opinion. Do not be distracted. It is our only duty to observe the commitment to give our lives for our ideals. Betraying our one ideal would leave a stain of disgrace. The Emperor is in extreme danger. The Emperor? Really? The Emperor is suffering a great deal. Therefore, for the sake of the country, I have a task to perform, with my life as the price. The situation is serious. We're checking with our superiors, and as soon as we get verification, we'll be able to act. Probably, our desires will be met one day. We'll meet our new selves when we re-establish our dignity, thanks to martial law. We'll make a blood oath. They still haven't contacted you? It's been five days. Five days? Does it mean that someone will come to warn you? I don't know. They've told us to wait and not contact them. They haven't already gathered? No, everything's fine. Perhaps they came to warn you today, while we were at the hospital. But that would be too hasty a warning, wouldn't it? I'm just going to see the sergeant. Who is it? It's me. Sorry for calling so late. Excuse me, but is the sergeant in? No, he's not. He left not long ago. He left? Have they contacted us? I don't know. He said that he'd be returning shortly. Shortly? I see... Forgive me, but could I possibly wait for him here? Please, go up to the first floor. CHAPTER ONE: EMPEROR OF THE NATION What are you doing in such a place? I welcome everyone's pity. But no one passes by here. But you have passed by. You're sitting here for me? I am sitting here for the people who walk by. Move over there. More people pass by over there. I am sitting here with the blessing of the Emperor. The Emperor told you to sit here? No. The Emperor does not know that I am sitting here. I see... Then you also think the Emperor exists above you? The Emperor knows that I am seated here. What is your method? Simply that I know the Emperor knows. I see. Then all is well. What do you think you're doing? I have nothing to do with you. Understand? I do not want to be forgiven by anyone. They're thinking of pardoning me, but I refuse. The Emperor won't pardon anyone. The Emperor simply knows. Of course, he also knows of you. I wonder if you could refuse the Emperor's forgiveness. But you can't refute the fact that the Emperor knows. Master! Excuse me, are you not Ikki Kita? I am he. - Are you all right? - I'm fine. Are you a messenger for someone? No. Thank you. That's enough. There's nobody about? No one. Right then, I'll tell you. In a dark room within these walls, a strategy is being plotted. There are seven navy officials, five from the army and six civilians. And the plan is this: to create a cabal of navy and cadet officers and to kill Prime Minister Inukai and the Minister of Interior Makino. They'll occupy the Industrial Union, the Asahi Newspaper and Tokyo Police Headquarters. They will attack electricity stations, provoking a black-out. It's all set for May 15th. May 15th? - Are you afraid? - No. That's it. That is all information I'll give you. Soon, five army officials will withdraw, because they think the timing is not right. But there's no need for you to think like that. You must choose your own path alone. I've said this to Nishida, and they've decided to withdraw. If Nishida didn't think like this, he'd have been a great asset. So you must carry out everything. Do not contact me. Yes, sir! Excuse me! Why? I want to be of use to my country. I see. I understand. Here's your assignment. This is the Tama electricity station. We're going to blow it up. At three in the morning, May 15th. - Can you do it? - Yes, sir! You'll be on your own. Take this. - But... - What is it? What should I do afterwards? Afterwards? Don't think about that. Do this and you'll understand. Perhaps when you blow the place up, in that moment you'll be set free. Concentrate your thoughts. So it's May 15th. Yes. May 15th. Can I help you? No, sir. There's someone here to see you. Tell them to go away. I wish to remain here awhile. Don't let anyone in. He can't receive you now, I'm afraid. Please arrange to come back another time. You? I thought I told you not to come here anymore. Fine. Let them come in. Please... This way. I couldn't do it. You couldn't do it? What are you talking about? My orders were to blow up the electricity station at Tama. You're taking part? Get out! This has nothing to do with me! I thought I told you that. Listen to me. I'm taking no part. "Don't do it," I said. Well... I didn't say that, but I said that I wouldn't do it. Also, Nishida isn't taking part. The army has withdrawn. Yes, sir. Even if you were to say that I instructed you to do it, there would be misunderstandings. You were waiting for them to contact you. I contacted you. That's all there is to it. I'll tell you this... You must decide yourself if you're going to participate or not. Is that not so? Yes, sir. Then there should be no problem. If you keep coming to my house, you put me in danger. Go back home. Do you have money? If it's money you need, that's no problem. I see... What was it you said before? Well... that I'd failed. Failed in what? I got to the electricity station, but I couldn't throw the grenade. - And then? - And then... I went home. I tried to return this to the house and ask for forgiveness, but nobody was there. I see. Have a seat. I'm not saying that I didn't want to take responsibility for your actions. I know that you are all righteous patriots. I've said as much to Officer Iwasa of the Secret Police. The Secret Police think that you were influenced by my Outline Plan... and you rebelled to achieve a state of martial law. And that's all very well. There's no harm in letting them believe this. They know very well that I am here, in front of the altar, reciting sutras from morning to evening. Understand? This is important to me. They can't fight me, so they must fight against my philosophy. Nishida's been shot! I don't know the details, but because he refused to take part in the plan, they're saying they've shot a traitor. - Is he dead? - No, but he's in a critical condition. Should we visit him? Visit him? Well... He was shot five times. It's a miracle he didn't die. A person called Nagamichi Kawasaki shot him. Do you know him? No. Apparently, they yelled "Traitor!" as they shot him. What does that mean? I'm finished here. He's not conscious yet, but his life's no longer in danger. Who are those people outside the room? I have no idea. I think you probably know. Who is this? You know Fusanosuke Kuhara of Kuhara Industries? He's the head clerk. Kuhara and Mitsui both passed money to Kita. Money for what? Probably for information. Kita sells information to Kuhara on the revolutionary youth movement. And the youth movement knows about this? I imagine so. If not Kita, who else would do it? They give money in support of the revolution. - This is Nishida? - Correct. And him at the back? I don't know. Perhaps an official in the youth movement? I don't think so. It's Nishida that controls the youth movement. I don't think Kita knows that much. Nishida doesn't want the other members to meet Kita. - Why's that? - That's Kita's strategy. Always in a safe position. And this time, it's Nishida who's taken the bullet. It'll stop with Nishida. Yes, but will it stop with this shooting? Because if it stops with Nishida and he becomes a martyr to the cause, Kita won't be unsatisfied with that. Kita's a person of deep intellect. What's this? I don't know. You don't know? I found it in the file. I have no idea when or where it was taken. - What do we do with him? - How involved was he? It's not clear, but he speaks without reserve and sincerely. - Good. - Shall we talk to him? We need to do a little work beforehand. We might find something of interest. I, er... I had gone to my uncle's house in Chiba. Please stop doing that. A long time ago, when I was still on my island... ...there was a person who punished me if I ever felt frightened. Now I have to punish myself. I have no one to forgive me. The next time you feel fear, I shall punish you. You? I understand your fears very well. You know what my fears are? You feared the two children that I'd had before we were married. And then, you feared that I wanted to have a child with you. That scared you. Stop it. It's true. I wanted to bear your child. Five or even ten children. I've always thought how wonderful it would be if we had children playing all around us. But you are afraid of having children who look just like you. You're fearful that I'll bear you children. - Stop it. - No! You want the best for Daiki because he's different from you. Because I didn't give birth to him! If it's something I fear, it's because you fear it also. You only say this because you think that I stay with you in order not to lose what we have built together. No, I... Yes, rather you're the one who's fearful. If you close your eyes, you'll see what you fear. - No, I don't see anything. - You see it! You see it clearly. I can see it. This translucent, ghostly form before me... ...it's taking hold of me. I can see it. But it does not see me. And this makes me afraid. No, it's nothing. I only wanted to make you see it. But you do not see it. Perhaps I alone am able to see it. Maybe I see it with the one eye that I lost as punishment so long ago on my island. Come to me. Tonight let's sleep in the same room. What was that? We picked it up in rather a strange place. We raided a place and found that and a copy of Ikki Kita's Outline Plan for Reorganisation... - Who was there? - Nobody important. Tell me, what do you think about Kita's martial law? What do you mean? I was just giving it some thought, listening to that. Makes me very uneasy. Uneasy, sir? It appeals to the pain he feels. He's a masochist. You think so? I tried to read Kita's Outline Plan for the Reorganisation... The only reason he wrote it is to advocate that all control should be in the hands of the military. All the rest is just decoration. If we understand martial law as a form of masochism, then this represents his image of the army. Who are you? I'm... a traitor. A spy! A spy? A spy from the Tokyo Secret Police. Please execute me. I've come here to be executed. Aren't you the soldier who came to find me when I was in the hospital with Master Kita? No, I am a spy. I am a traitor. Please execute me. Very well, come on! What happened? I found him standing in front of the house. He's that soldier, isn't he? He says he's a spy from the Tokyo Secret Police. A spy? What's going on? This morning, he suddenly said, "Let's visit our family in Chiba." So we left the house. However, we don't have any relatives in Chiba. Then, on the way, he drank a lot of alcohol and wandered around, and finally this is where we've ended up. He's not been at the barracks? He took short leave. But the permission expired last month. And that's it? A deserter? Well, you can stay here. - Is that all right? - It'll be fine. He had no idea what to do. We need time to plan and foment rebellion. Just give us time, Master. I beseech you. I understand them. - They feel they must do it. - And you need my permission? Not for that, but... Today, I've heard the same thing repeated to me, that Nishida won't betray us this time. We shall march onwards towards the nation's restoration. Great Chamberlain! We are here to take your life. We harbour no resentment towards you. We harbour no resentment. This morning, Nishida telephoned. He told me to tell you, "We did it." They will be coming to speak to you later. Indeed? It's so bright. It's snow. It's snowing. Snow? What happened to that soldier? He's inside the house. I told him to come and eat with us, but he declined. I see. In the area around parliament, we're looking here and here. All's going well, the group is very well-organised. The Army Minister and his followers are feeling jittery, but they're bringing military councillors to the Imperial Palace, so something should come of that. Among the councillors are Masaki and Araki. The group met General Masaki some time ago, and he said he didn't want to hear if they were planning anything. What did he mean by that? A tacit agreement. You carry on as you are. And I will commit to doing what I can. So the group's been to the Imperial Palace? No, only Masaki. It'll fine, I have confidence in him. I've already spoken about it with Prince Saionji. I have asked that all be held under control at the Imperial Palace. Obviously, it depends on Masaki prevailing. What are your thoughts? So the group hasn't been to the Imperial Palace. - What about others' reactions? - Others? - The general reaction. - Strangely quiet. It seems the newspapers have mentioned the size of the Revolutionary Army. The Revolutionary Army? More than a revolutionary army, it's an army of justice, no? Certainly, an army of justice. If the Imperial Way Faction tries a coup d'état, it would all be over. That's not what I meant. The revolutionary army threatens with force, the army of justice threatens with justice. That's the difference. The group has already executed six senior statesmen. By these acts, they are confirming their own sense of righteousness and their beliefs. And they're going about this quietly and assuredly. Of course, the problem has resolved itself and receded into the distance. But we must... indeed the group as a whole, we must do nothing but impose our occupation in silence. Do we force the group to go to the Imperial Palace? No... We must hold the line, steadfast. Any vacillation and it's over. I am not a spy. You're not a spy. The Master also believes that. I am not a spy, but not because the Master thinks I'm not. I am not a spy! I know that. Why does no one suspect me? Because you are not a spy. That's not so! That's not so... In order to verify that I am not a spy, there must be an investigation. Nobody suspects you. What do we need to do? Well, for the meantime, we stand firm. Until the Emperor has made clear his decision. And how do you think the Emperor will decide? Perhaps... ...the Emperor will decide nothing. Maybe he's never contemplated anything like this before. The two factions have been contemplating it, but the Emperor has simply maintained his silence. If that were true... it would indeed be a problem. Punish me! No. Why not? Because you become weak-willed after you've been punished. Master, I have some good news. News about the War Minister was announced by the Defence General. "The Emperor now knows of the uprising, "and he has said that it's all part of our national goal." And... they've decided to incorporate the group into the defence forces. - You've evacuated the occupied zone? - No. The group left members to watch over the Imperial Palace. That sounds promising... Well, we don't have to pull back the troops. The group must retain the right to occupy the area around the Parliament. The problem is... how long we can keep this up. - I understand. - Inform the others. Is this how the sky looks under martial law? Martial law? Of course, no one would think such a thing immediately. Nevertheless, if under this sky, there was an army of 1,400 armed men that had enough ammunition to take control of this country, would each and every one's concept of justice remain true? They've been incorporated into the defence group. Their deployment remains the same. Now their task is limited to repressing the Communists, at least it seems. Imposing martial law involves danger. However if we are in danger, better a danger we can understand rather than one we can't fathom. Of course, the other faction wants us to fear something we can't understand. Let go of me! Just let me go! Let's go home. Let go! What are you doing there? What is it? Master! I need your help, please! Help? I don't know what to do! Hold fast. Don't breathe and hold fast. You think that you want to be hated by someone, that you want to be loved by someone. Enough of this. Go! Withdraw the troops? No! Out of the question! Otherwise we'll have failed. Understand? Remain there no matter what. That's the only thing that matters. Suicide? Who's spoken of that? Don't be so foolish! What on earth is it? What's happened? You've incorporated the troops into the defence group, right? All went well, didn't it? The situation has changed. The troops have withdrawn. They must not withdraw. There must be no suicides. Understand? You must defend your position at all cost. You are there representing martial law. The martial law that you have proclaimed! You must not fall to the opposition. You have room to manoeuvre, no? Continue as you are, and the army can do nothing. Then General Yaragawa will surely become prime minister. He's in Taiwan at the moment, isn't he? Masaki would do well. Recommend General Masaki. That's more pragmatic. Do you understand? Did you notice? Outside the window just now, there were two wounded soldiers. They're looking to me as a rallying point for the Patriotic Society. But I can't do it. I refuse. Listen, I have absolutely nothing to do with this matter. I imagine there'll be no more telephone calls. Go now. It would be better if you didn't come back here. Master! Are you not telling me to go? Do you have any place to go? - Yes, sir. - Then go. Master, we've come for you. You've been summoned by the Secret Police. Is that so? The rebellious troops have completely surrendered. All the officers have been arrested. I see. It seems that he hated me. He wasn't a spy, but it seems he wanted to become a spy, simply because you would never have suspected him. Rather odd, isn't it? It is odd. Perhaps the same could be said of me, if no one had suspected me. Maybe he's your true disciple. The place of execution is over there. I am to be executed? As ringleader of the rebel army. The rebel army provoked a faction of the Imperial Army, driving out the controlling party. And all according to your plot, the order was given to have Masaki as Prime Minister instead of Yaragawa. It was said that Yaragawa was in Taiwan, much too far away to become Prime Minister. Obviously, we don't think this is a charade on your part. You think it's an ingenious stratagem? Precisely. But... the Emperor isn't disappointed? I imagine not. His Majesty has taken precautions against this stratagem of yours, and, for that matter, against any other plans. And he did this for your sake. This is the Emperor's way of showing you mercy. What of the others? They've already gone. Shouting "Long live the Emperor" to the end. Will you do the same? That's all very well, but I could never be flippant when facing death. Raise your weapons! Fire!
