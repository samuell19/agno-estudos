GONDOLA Good. Stretch out your legs. Hey, stop, he's heavy! Come on, dummy, stop! What?! Sir! Kagari needs help! You're home? What do you think? Is this hairstyle cool or what? What a strange child. What are you just standing there for? Are you going already? Yes, in a minute. Kagari, I'm going now. There's a pizza in the fridge. If you're going shopping, buy some eggs, because I forgot. Bye. Make sure to lock the door. - Hey, hurry, come on, hurry! - Come on on, hurry! We don't have time! Wait! You know, there's a test tomorrow. - Yeah... - Did you study for it? No. I'll get zero or 50% at best. You're really pushing it. Why don't we go shopping in Shinjuku for some clothes again? - What if everyone fails? - It'd be great if everyone failed. - It'd be awesome. - True. Let's go. Everything's going to be alright. There, there... such a good birdy. Alright then... we'll leave it in the oxygen tent and check on it tomorrow. Cheer up. We better hurry... your folks are probably worried. Why? - Your folks—they're usually late? - Yeah. How much did the vet cost? Don't worry about it. No, I want to know. About ¥12,000. School's out? Uh-huh. - What grade are you in? - Fifth. I see, you're on summer vacation. - You don't have time off? - No. Are you going somewhere with your parents? Why do you ask? Here. How much do I owe you? It's OK. You're good. Why are you following me? I don't have money. I'll pay you tomorrow. Are you listening? Yeah, I'm listening. Which windows are you cleaning tomorrow? - A skyscraper in Shinjuku. - Alright, see you tomorrow. I won't let you sleep. You don't need to compare me. Just stop. I already have a toothache. Go see a dentist then. Anyway, I'm not asking you to do anything unreasonable. But deep down you actually think it's my obligation as a woman. You just pretend like you don't so that I'll appreciate having you as a husband. Want me to say what you're really thinking? "Please just stay home and cook... - and stop drinking." - That's enough. I've sacrificed so much for your dreams. Now it's Kagari's birthday, and all of a sudden, you want to act like a father? How does coming home early for a special occasion... turn into an issue? It just does! And it's not the only issue either! You quit your musician job... when we decided to start a family... and that's how you lost confidence in yourself. Say, how about going out and finding a real job? - Be a real father; a provider. - Shut up! I just don't get it. How did... - Are you hot? Are you OK? - Yeah. Either you have it or you don't. It's my third time. Do you want it or not? Of course I want it, but... Well then, make the decision. I'm so uncertain. I can't keep aborting. Yet I don't have the confidence to do it alone. But we're all alone. Rather than breaking up and being left alone halfway through... it's probably easier to decide to do it alone from the start. Are you ever glad that you had a child? I don't know. Did he die? Here. I'm a little short, but I'll pay you the rest later. Are you going to help me bury him or not? - You used to live here? - Uh-huh. Stop it! You're driving me crazy! Let's bury him. Wait, never mind. I'll never be able to visit here. Chiko just keeps rotting. When you die, what happens to the part of you that was alive? All the things you saw, heard, thought... Where I'm from, they say we return to the sea. We become the ocean and live forever. Do you know why the waves rise? Because the spirits of the deceased laugh, cry, get mad... it's their souls wavering. Why? They're protecting the living. Are you glad you've become an adult? Isn't it sad? It's green. When did you start that job? After high school. Do you enjoy it? Did I say something strange? - I don't mind. - I'm sorry. It's the first time since coming to Tokyo 3 years ago... that I've talked to someone on the other side of the window. - Where were you before? - Aomori's Shimokita Peninsula. Near the ocean? Yeah. You can see Hokkaido from there. Do you know what this is? It's the sound of A. Do you ever dream while you're awake? - What kind of dream? - I don't know exactly. When I'm on the gondola and I look down at the city, I begin to see the ocean. I don't want to go home. This is for you. - Why? - Take it. So, you finally decided. I wish I could tell you to hang in there... but it's you who has to bear and raise the child. Yeah. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. What? Marriage? Wait a minute. If you wait for him to keep his word, it's gonna be too late to do anything. Hold on a second. True, but it's not really something... I should stick my neck into. Well... I'll talk to the boss and explain your situation, OK? Kagari! REIKO MATSUMOTO - Hey, what did you do with Chiko?! - Where have you been? Where have you been? I threw it away! - Where? - I threw it away! - Give him back! - Why do you do things like this? You know that's all I have left from my childhood. Give him back! Did you realize the stench? No matter how much I washed, it wouldn't go away! Do you want some ice cream? Why don't you come home early on days like this? So it's my fault? Your fault? She has a fever and she's in pain. And is that my fault too? Can you stop blaming me for everything? Everything is always my fault. I don't know what you're thinking, but... I don't come home late just because I feel like it! I'm working! I have a job! Here we go again. Silent, as usual. How long do you think it's been since you quit working? Since you stopped playing the piano? You said you wanted to compose decent music... - how long's it going to take?! - Give it a rest! I'm doing the best I can. It hasn't even been two years yet. Composing music is useless... unless it comes from the mind. I've heard that one before. Enough already. I can't take it anymore. You always have the same excuses. Spare me the speech. I don't care. If you're actually concerned about Kagari, start by looking for a job. A regular one's fine. Bring some money home. I have a lot of things I want to do too! Maybe you're not talented enough. So why don't you stop? Why don't you call it quits? Give up already! I heard you, OK?! Kagari. Kagari. Open your eyes. The trains are still running. I'll accompany you home. Regardless of the reason, running away isn't good. Your mother wouldn't mean to hurt you. I bet she's worried. I don't have any place to go home to. Kagari? Are you still mad? What's your village like? It's a fishing village. I have candy. Do you want some? No, but I'll have some later. - Where are we staying tonight? - My home. - Who's there? - My mom and dad. What's your father do? He used to be a fisherman, but he got sick and can't work anymore. So your mother works? Right. Every morning she goes to the market, gets fish, then goes around on her bike selling them. Sounds like hard work. Hey... what the hell is that doing here? Are you trying to kill me? Toshio, you've had too much to drink! - Shut up, you got any complaints?! - Don't lie down here! Hey, Toshio, Toshio! - Ryo, please come help me! - You'll never understand how I feel! Toshio! Quit causing Mom trouble, forcing her to do all the work! I dare you to say that again! Sure, I'll say it again! Just because you can't fish anymore, all you do is drink! You're useless! Everybody's having a hard time, but we're all out working! You're the only one loafing around at home! Damn you! Hey! I'm a fisherman! Why would a fisherman look for a job on dry land?! You're no fisherman! You're just a drunken layabout! Stop it! Stop it! Stop, no! Both of you, stop! Stop, you two! No! Hey, there's the ocean! It's early but it's pitch black. We don't have streetlights like in Tokyo. - Can I ask something? - What is it? Are the toilets in outhouses? Yes. - The ocean is so close. - Yeah. This is it. Mom. What are you doing here? - I got a few days off. - Really? What's wrong? Good evening. Who is this? She's my boss's daughter. She has nowhere to go for the summer, so I brought her with me. Oh, is that so? Come in, you had a tiring trip. Please, make yourself comfortable. Thank you for the hospitality. Hey, don't be so polite. You must be tired from the long journey. Where's Dad? He's watching the Giants game. Can you stay awhile? About 2 or 3 days. It must be difficult being so busy. How are you? Any better? Your dad goes out everyday now. He takes long walks on the shore. He likes watching the ocean. Hey, Toshio... it's been a while since you've seen such a cute child. They've become rare. Why didn't you let me know ahead of time? I could have prepared something a little better. I don't think a Tokyoite would be able to eat this. Tomorrow, I'll prepare something better. Let's eat. I bet you're hungry. - Thank you. - Thank you for this meal. Let me cut that for you. - Kagari, what grade are you in? - Fifth. You're almost all grown up. It's so dirty here. I bet you were surprised. He's like a child, isn't he? He's become sick, and he's losing control of his body. He looks threatening at times, but he's not actually mad. - Come on, have some more, don't be shy. - Alright. This fish is good. Great. I'm glad you like it. See this? This bowl was Ryo's when he was little. Hey there, you're spilling it. Let's take a bath together. It's a small bath, isn't it? Say, Kagari... - how do you write your name? - The way it sounds. Really? What a nice name. - How's the temperature? - It's fine. Come inside and have some watermelon. You should have slept longer. I'll make breakfast as soon as I'm done here. He was punished. Treating you like a slave, drinking all the time... it would have been better if he'd just died. Don't ever say that again! No matter what, he will always be your father! Kagari, who do you usually take a bath with? I take it alone. Mom has to work... I see. Your mom works too? That's just like me. Let me scrub your back now. Sure. Alright, there. That feels great. It's been years since someone scrubbed my back. It scared me... Oh, that. It's nothing to be afraid of. We call them Onigumo. They protect the house. This one's been there for years. Good night. Ah, look at you. Isn't she adorable, Toshio? I wonder what your mother's praying for. Can't sleep? She's praying that Dad will get better... that I won't fall from the gondola... that we'll all be happy. Are you ready to go home? What are they making? They're making dried fish. Everyone's so kind and gentle. I wonder why. It's probably because they're weak. Are they really going to tear it down? Yes. Why does everyone leave? Because they can't survive here any longer. What about before? Kagari. Kagari. Kagari. - Hurry up. - OK. - Don't fall. - I'm alright. Let's go. Are you going to break it? I'm going to use the wood to fix that boat, and also make a coffin for Chiko. Here, help yourself. Tonight's meal is probably a little better. Thank you for always sending us money. No, no. None for you. I can't. Mom, please. Just for tonight. - Alright, cheers. - Cheers. Let's eat. Here you go. - Oh, you're going to help? - Yes. Ah, you're such a sweet child, Kagari. Thank you. The moon's so bright. Yeah. - What song is that? - It's my father's song. It's a beautiful melody. What are you doing? Just drink it. It's called purification saké. Now Chiko can return to the sea. - Here. - Thanks. This is goodbye. Yeah... Do it. We go back tomorrow. Yeah. I don't want to go. The sun will shine. The sun will shine! - "The sun will shine?" - Yes. Kagari. What? Could you play that song? OK.
