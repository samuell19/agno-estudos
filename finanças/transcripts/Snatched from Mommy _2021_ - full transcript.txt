Nothing, I just love you in tennis shorts. Lunch with the girls? I have been cooped up in this house For almost a year and Evan's whole life. The doctor says we can go out, we're going out. I know, it's just maybe... What? Another three months? Six? You need to tell daddy that you are brave and strong And ready to take on the world. He will be if he's your son. Well, if you're going to be out in the world... You need something to wear. Sneaky daddy. Oh... Awe so cute. -Hello. -Hi, thanks. Would you mind helping me? -Of course, no problem. -Thanks.

Well, if you don't want to... Hi, can I take you out of here? It gets stuck. Hi! Oh, you perfect little preemie. I could just take you home and eat you up. Are you getting any sleep? No. But getting no sleep at home Is much better than getting no sleep in the nicu. Does your optimism never waver? Shush, after two years of ivf and how many weeks of bedrest, She has earned every glorious, bleary-eyed moment. You know my bitterness is just jealousy, right? Jealousy? Elizabeth m Daley, best-selling author. Perfect wife, doting mother with a beautiful baby. And Kate winters, single, lonely cat lady Who loves opera and ice cream And is on the precipice of purity again. Precipice of purity? Poetic. You Katie, wonderful designer, Are under selling yourself and far over selling me. Excuse me, I don't mean to bother, But could I get you to... Oh yeah, sure. Just let me know who I need to make it out to. Janet, Janet Carling with a c. I loved it. I love all your books. So gripping! When can we expect the next one to come out? Oh, it's not going to be for a while. I'm taking some time off. Oh, of course. I raised three myself. Lost one, but still: Best job I ever had. I'm so sorry. I read your books so much, I hear your voice in my head. It's like you're a friend. Thanks. Thank you! Over selling, you were saying? I need to look at this menu right now. Hi. So, we are going to have three mandarin chicken salads. And can you bring those bite sized shredded potatoes, And the big bowl of fruit salad, And maybe just pick some pastries, will you? Thank you. Well honey, if you don't want to be the center of attention, Let me step in: I am pregnant! (gasps) What? The ivf took? I know, four years. Holy test tube, right? You have so much more patience than me. At least I have Jeff, I can't imagine doing all of that on my own... Oh hey, a woman's gotta do what a woman's gotta do, right? Oh, we can be each other's godmothers. Yes! Wow, now I feel even better about myself. You two are going to be baby-talking all the time And I'll have no one to share my dating woes with. Oh, please! You know we are so jealous of your dating woes. Do tell, kitty Kate. [baby cries] He's tired, he's not gonna last long. Hi Shar. Hey mom, how's the little treasure? You and Jeff make beautiful babies. Hopefully babies. Oh, you want more? Got more eggs on ice. But I need to wait a little bit Before the amnesia of this experience Wears off before I have another one. Please just tell me that you're gonna give me another book Before you have another baby. I'm not ready to jump into another book, Sher. I need a couple more months of baby time. I bet you can't. That computer is going to call to you Like the sirens to Ulysses. No one knows what that means anymore. Besides, between feedings and changings, there's no time. And even when he's sleeping, My books are about murders and crime scenes. But you love that stuff. Not right now. And half of my stories have babies who... It's just too close, can't you get that? No. But I get that you do. Hey babe. How is it? It was great! Straight sets. Ken didn't know what hit him. Hey, Shar. Hey baby. Come here. Look at you. My sweet little baby boy. All right, take some time off. I can use the time off to drive up your price. Supply and demand. But I would take a romance novel, too. Or, I would also take a follow up to murder in the marshes. Now that one was a... Bye, Sharon. [baby coos] Best job I ever had. [baby crying] Ready yet? Yeah. I love that thing. Still the best job ever at 3 a.M.? Best job 24/7. [alarm rings] What are you doing here? I'm calling the police! [screaming] , my little love. How did you sleep last night? You only woke up seven times, I guess that's an improvement. Yeah, from 17. I heard you and Sharon yesterday. Work? Yeah, she wants my next book. And what do you want? I don't know... I miss the writing, but writing about multiple homicides Seems a little bit wrong right now. Okay, then write about something else. Like what? It took me 15 years to become an expert in my field. Am I gonna turn to aerodynamics? Yeah, if you wanted to. Or you could write about being a mom? I've been a mom four months. Yeah, but you've been through a lot more than most. Besides, you've got something to say About every little piece of gear that we've got, From bottle warmers to baby bags. What four month mom writes like you? A book about mom'ing? Yeah! No murder, no mayhem. No time. A blog? A topic a day, an hour? It could be great for you. Think about it. [phone ringing] Hello? This is Elizabeth Daley. What? They're certain all the samples were destroyed? I feel so selfish. Dr. Merkel is dead And all I can think of is how Evan Isn't going to have a brother or sister. -We don't know that. -Yes we do. It took so long for us to find a viable egg, Jeff. I can't go through that again. You okay? Yeah. I'm just gonna go down to the office. Start a book? A blog. I've spent so many years Writing about the tragedies of others. It never occurred to me that I'd be writing about my own. But in my heart right now, I feel like I just had a hundred children die. Lizzy, this is heartbreaking. With extra honey, just how you like it. Have you heard from the clinic? Just about the doctor, but I didn't have any extra. One and done. Will you be able to get pregnant again? [sighs] So how did you learn to do this? Blog? There's about a million youtube videos. Can I spruce up your design a little bit? I was hoping you'd ask! Are you sure you want to be putting Everything out there like this though? It's just a lot to share with total strangers. I've got to get it out. You could get it out to me. No. I need to write it out. I could never share this kind of stuff with the world. Too many haters. You know what? You're right. I'm sure there will be a million moms Who will hang on your every word. I could never have made it through ivf without you. You were my inspiration. Not just yours it seems. Thank you so much for your heartfelt story. Come see the nursery. Oh it's lovely. I like the yellow. They call it "sunflower." May I make a little safety suggestion? Don't leave the bassinet by the window. Is that from the blog? No, from a book actually. Oh! "death in Dallas." I remember the kidnapper came in through the nursery window! Yes, but more to the point, The baby will get tangled in the pull string by the shades. Smart. Five best-sellers and now a hit blog. Does everything you touch turn to gold? Oh yes, honey. Blessed by fate. I don't know who tests these things, But my advice would be to find a mom With a baby in her arms and see how she does. If your baby is fussy, they could be wet, hungry, [camera starts recording] Breast or bottle? It's the endless quandary. Personally, I breastfeed and pump So that my husband can help at night. We supplement with a little bit of formula So I don't have to worry about his weight. What about you guys? What do you think? Let me know in the comments box. Thanks for being so honest, Elizabeth. I've been through six long years of ivf And still haven't gotten pregnant. Liz, this could be a book! Sharon, it's a blog. I know, but can't we just put all the blog posts together And just turn it into a book? Two thousand followers already. Everyone's a potential buyer. I guess that's why I pay you the big bucks. Hmm? "mommy says no-no?" Supplementing with formula. What's wrong with you? You should be looking after your baby, Not wasting all this time showing off. How could she? I am tired and hormonal! Who says this kind of stuff? You've had negative comments before. About my books. This is about me and my baby! It's not about you, Liz. Online trolls, it's about them. She's probably some terrible mother Who can't blame herself, so she's blaming you. It's part of putting yourself out there. You told me to put myself out there! Yeah I did. And I'm glad I did. But her, you need to ignore. [phone ringing] Hey Kate. Hey. Am I bothering you? Can you talk? Yeah, what's up? I saw Brandon today. Lizzy? Uh sorry. Wait, what? Brandon? I thought you guys broke up? Is this a bad time? I can call later. Damn! Are you okay? Yeah. Can you meet me? Yeah. Mommy says no-no: "go screw yourself." How dare she! She's probably not even a woman. She's probably not even a mom! I'm serious. Some big hairy dude with nothing better to do. Can you block her? I've tried with my books. You block them, they just make a new user name. You block their ip address And they go to the library and use the computer there. Haters are always gonna find a way. That's the downfall of the internet. Can I get another orange juice? You? -I'll have another mimosa. -Of course. Oh, I'll have another mimosa? Hello? Pregnant, breastfeeding, a little moral support? When I'm pregnant, And you both will probably have teenagers by then, I fully expect you to drink your way through brunch While I suffer with orange juice. Well I am suffering just waiting for this guy. Seriously? Where is he? You ordered like eight seconds ago. I'll just go get it myself. Impatient much? When I was pregnant, I couldn't even wait two seconds for anything. Poor Jeff, I had him hopping-to-it Like the Easter bunny. I kind of miss it. Can she really use that excuse, though? Julie's been a diva since the day you introduced us. Oh, long before that. When we were in college, We went to her parents' beach house. She used to sit out on the boat, god bless her, Gin fizz in her hand, Holding court with the boys all day long. Oh sorry, mine was supposed to be an orange juice, too. I'm sorry. You know I'll drink it. Can you just bring another orange juice? Of course. Toast with me. I'm not drinking. I know, just don't make me feel so left out. Clink and then give it to me. To old friends and new lives, May mine be as great as yours. Under selling. Setting my sights high. Good, at least he came back. And got it wrong. There's another orange juice on the way. I heard mimosas aren't your drink anyway. Gin fizzes? You told her about the lake house! Those were the days. Party like rockstars. I hope you painted a gentle picture of me in my youth. Of course. That's an idea. Mommy says no-no, maybe be gentle with her? Gentle? Sorry, what happened to big hairy dude With nothing better to do? Gut reaction. She's clearly in a lot of pain. Write something nice. Nice? High road. Turn the other cheek. Okay, I have never understood that expression. Seems to me, the other cheek is just gonna get slapped. Tell her you welcome all comments And thank her for hers. I'm gonna be sick. It's better than getting in an online brawl. No, I'm really gonna be sick. Oh... I do not miss those days. Why do you think you're so special? You are so selfish! Do you ever think of your baby? I thought you said you were going to ignore her. Dear mommy says no-no... I welcome all comments... ...And appreciate yours. I wasn't filming that yet. Look! She's following me! She's spying on me! Okay, look... You don't need to freak out! Freak out? How are you not freaking out? Because this freak is not just following your wife, Who's about to go mama bear on her And tear through walls to stop her, But she's also following your baby. [glass breaking] [alarm sounding] [baby crying] Jeff, be careful! You're not used to having some aggressive readers? Not like this. Never in person. Can you stop her? Her? You have an idea who did this? And she calls herself, mommy says no-no. Mommy says no-no? What makes you think she broke your window? She's been stalking me online, following me around town. Ridiculing me... -But you don't know she broke the window? Who else? Online bullies rarely go irl. In real life. It's the anonymity that empowers them. You got a real name? If we don't know who she is, It's gonna be hard to keep her away. So focus on keeping her out. You've got an alarm system. Add some deadbolts. Maybe window bars. How scary. Are you okay? I'm... Let's go to lunch. Give her a sec to breathe, Jules. She can breathe over a salad. I don't know, I don't think I... Don't let her get to you, Elizabeth. She's a loser. Well, right now it feels like she's winning. You can't let her stop you. You know, I did this blog as a hobby. It's not like it's my career. I did it to relieve my sorrows, not cause more. But it's not just about your sorrows anymore. You've got followers sharing their own. If you let mommy says-go-to-hellena Montana Stop you, you're letting her stop them all. You said not to get into a brawl. That was before she smashed into your house. Now it's time to fight back! Okay Kate, this is not just a war of words. Maybe Liz should just let it go before this gets out of hand. Yeah, I have more important things to do. Exactly. Exactly. What kind of example do you want to set for him? When the going gets tough, the tough give in? You gotta kick that... Ah, don't say the b-word! You know I hate the b-word, it's misogynistic. I know, it's just so expressive. What can I call her? We don't have to call her any... She's a douchebag! And you gotta fight back. Dear mommy says no-no. As I sit here looking at my beautiful son Of whom you have so invidiously accused me of mistreatment, I pity you. How sad your life must be. Do your children feel your wrath? Do you even have children? High road... [sighs] You okay? Want me to stay home? Why don't you get out, go to the park? What are you afraid she's gonna...? No. I'm going to home. Jeff, please just go to work. Okay, I'm going to come home early then. [computer beeps] Drinking alcohol and breast feeding? Send more tips from jail. I made a toast and put it down. -Ignore. -I can't. What if she comes closer than this? What if she comes back to our house again? Then we get a restraining order. We don't know her name! The clinic. What about the... Somebody breaks into the clinic, Destroys all our eggs and then this happens! It's her! It's mommy says no-no. -We don't know that. -We don't know anything, Jeff! That's what's frightening me. This woman is stressing me out. [doorbell rings] If the recluse won't come out to lunch, We bring lunch to the recluse. Sweetie, what's wrong? Oh my god! Can I please use the b-word now? Or any other letter? You know, I'm actually not sure the b-word Is strong enough at this point. You want my perfect life now, Kate? Seems like my Midas touch has worn off. Now everything I touch turns to sh... ...Sheesh! Spa day starts in 30 minutes! We thought you could use some tranquility. You guys, I don't really feel like going out. It's not out. It's in a spa, members only. Private entrance. Evan? Oh, you are going to need a babysitter. Hello, babysitter? Have you been in the garage all morning? Had my laptop. I just want you to get what you need, hon. You guys... I love you so much. As crazy as I've been lately, I don't deserve you. Nope. No, you don't. Well I mean, you guys can go to the jacuzzi room if you want. I just, you know, no hot water for baby. I'm so ready for my bump. Geez, Jules. I'm not pregnant and I don't look that good. Do not let the abs fool you. I am throwing up like three times a day. So, no Brandon? Oh gosh, totally gone. I have baby pictures! Oh! Heartbeat yet? Like 185. Round head, ten fingers and toes. Boy or girl? Dunno. Look Katie. Look at the cute little nose. Yeah. He or she is so... Mono-chromatic. Here, let me show you a photo of my cat. Okay, don't be jealous. Of course I'm jealous. I just renewed my subscription to the opera channel To fill the endless nights ahead of me on my couch, alone. It'll happen for you. Thank you guys so much for this. Oh, of course. Now just do not go home and stress. No more mommy says no-no! Nope. I am done with her. Evan, come on sweetie. Come on, you know... Ouch! [baby crying] Seriously. What? Oh! I'm... Are you Elizabeth m. Daley? Why? Are you following me? What? Are you stalking me? Are you mommy says no-no? Who? No... Just leave me alone! I was just hoping you would sign my book... [alarm sounds] I'm so embarrassed, I'm just... What am I doing, Jeffrey? And I think my milk's drying up. I'm sure it's not. Are you sure that my breasts are still producing milk, Because our son is telling me otherwise? Honey, this isn't easy to bring up. But what about what the doctor said? Postpartum depression? To look for the signs... I am not depressed, Jeffrey. This woman is stalking me! She's taking pictures of me. She's writing lies about me. She's saying that I am a terrible mother! -You've seen it! -I have. And I'm not saying that it's not horrible. She's getting to me. She's making me doubt myself. Am I a horrible mother? Of course not. Am I letting my stress get to Evan? I've seen you deal with more stress than this, love. -Work deadlines... -this isn't work! Ivf treatments. Disappointing results, over and over again. I saw you battle preeclampsia and Evan in an incubator. And none of it made you react like this! She broke into our house! Look, I'm just suggesting that maybe your reactions Are being exacerbated by... I don't have postpartum depression! ♪ ♪ ♪ You're so full of yourself. What makes you think because you write bad crime books You can tell us about motherhood? Screw taking the high road. What do you expect me to do, Elizabeth? They're the ones who are giving her this platform to hate. So they should have to take it down. Alright, well I'm here. So draw up the letters, Or I'm going to take my next book to another lawyer. No! No, no, no... Evan, honey. Hi mommy's here. Okay, hi yes... Are you true mom? Elizabeth Daley, right? No. Baby, it's okay. Hi. Hi yes, I have my baby locked in a car. No, I'm not at home. No, I don't have another fob. Why would I have a another fob if I'm not at home? Why'd you take your blog down? I loved it! Is this seriously is what you want to talk about right now? When I have a screaming baby locked in the car! What can I do? Find a cop. Do you have nothing better to do? Go away! Hi Evan, honey. Can you see mommy? Hi yes, umm... Please, just get somebody here Who can help me get my baby out of the car. You want me to call roadside assistance? That's gonna take like 2 hours! How about you get a tow-truck that can be here In five minutes before my baby... [screaming] I waved down a cop car in the alley. Find a rock. Go! Hi honey. Baby, it's okay. Honey, are you okay? Mommy loves you. I'm sorry! [police sirens] [doorbell rings] Mr. Daley? I'm Marjorie Anderson, social services. Social services? Mrs. Daley, may I come in? No. Come in. I understand there was quite an incident yesterday. That wasn't an incident. I saw the videos. So you saw the person who ran over my car keys? No, I saw you try to smash your window Open with a brick while your baby was locked inside. Accident or not, quite frankly you lost it, Mrs. Daley. There are pictures of you online drinking... That was staged. -Your house was broken into. -And that's our fault? My job is to make sure this is a safe environment for the child. One visit a week for six weeks, Mr. Daley. You can accept that, or fight it in court. My milk's dried up, so... I'm a terrible mother. You're a great mom. Social services was just here to tell me I'm a terrible mother. No, they were just here to... You know what? Maybe... I am experiencing a tiny bit of postpartum depression. And maybe that is making me overreact To this online you-know-what. So, I am happy to go to my ob tomorrow to talk about it. Not happy to, but I'm gonna do it. Aren't you going to work? I'm giving you the day off. No, you already did that. I'm fine, Jeff. I'm okay. I'm going to be okay. Go to work, I love you. I love you too. This is all so cute, Katie. Thank you so much, it's so generous of you. I still can't believe social services came. It was humiliating. She looked at me like I was crazy. I don't know, maybe I am. Why has this woman chosen me to pick on? Jealousy. You think? Are you kidding? Look around you, Elizabeth. You have it all. Who wouldn't be jealous? ♪ ♪ ♪ [phone ringing] Jeff Daley. Hey tim... I'm just getting in my car. Can I call you back in ten minutes? Alright, man. Bye.

Well I know whose gonna like this. And the chocolates should be for me. These are beautiful, thank you. Katie, can I ask you a favor? Jeff can barely walk and I'm pretty afraid. I guess I could take care of both of them, But would you mind taking Evan tonight? I would owe you so big. Of course Lizzy, anything you need. And you don't owe me anything. I'll show you how to do the bottles And the car seat and everything. I'll even be fine changing diapers. Thanks, Katie. Check check triple check. Evan and aunt Kate are gonna have fun.

Liz, you have to sleep. She won, Jules. I can't prove anything, but... I took the blog down and I think we're gonna move. What? Where? I don't know, I'm thinking new york. When Jeff's able. Sharon can help get us setup. Okay, but into what? The three of you in some thousand square foot apartment? I don't feel safe in my own home. I don't feel safe outside of my home. And if Jeff had... I know. [kisses smacking] Okay, okay. Are you okay? Me? Are you okay? I'm great, I've got Ken Drucker on the courts tomorrow. Do they give handicaps in tennis? I'm pretty sure I can still beat him.

I may have gone alone, But the opera and ice cream afterwards Made me feel like I was on the best date of my life. No! No, no, no... Pascal's, the spa, opera and ice cream? Who would do this? And then she had lunch with me to commiserate? Who would do that? Are you sure, Elizabeth? I mean, Kate? Mommy says no-no all along? Have you seen how jealous she is of me? Of us? Of our babies? And then she put my husband in the hospital. It was all for this. And I gave her Evan... She sent me a photo this morning! Okay. Okay, I'll call the police And I'll send them to Kate's house. I'm not waiting to get my baby back. Kate! No! Any idea where would have gone? Hometown? Parents? Her parents are both gone. She's from Milwaukee. She's been here for 15 years, I've known her ten. We met sitting beside each other speed dating. She was my best friend. I'll put out an amber alert if you want, Mrs. Daley. But I gotta tell you... You're famous. You'll have a media swarm outside your house, Crank callers, false ransom demands... It will make it all a lot harder. I'd say this case, better to do it quietly, Bring in the FBI. They'll put a tap on your phones. And I? Hope she calls. I'm so sorry... You... Shh... We're gonna find him. I don't know what Kate did or what she's thinking, but... I know she'd never hurt Evan. We'll find him. I love you. [phone ringing] Hey. Hold on a second, I'm just going down stairs. What do I do, Jules? Do I eat, sleep, watch TV? While Kate is god knows where with my baby? Are you sure you don't want me to come over? I could be there in... It's the middle of the night. There's nothing to do right now, anyway. Except be with you. It was just a few days ago we were both so excited About making each other godmothers. That was so that Evan would have you to look after him If anything happened to Jeff and I. Nothing was supposed to happen to him. Lizzy, listen to me. Evan is going to be fine. Okay honey, I promise. You said the fbi's on their way. They could find him so fast. You just cannot give up hope. Hope? I've been hearing that word a lot lately. It just means that I have to sit back And wait for someone else to find my baby. I bet he's scared. He's so scared. Why Kate? Why would you do this? I can't believe what you've been through... No mother should suffer like that... Why'd you take down the blog? Am I writing too much? I'm annoying you, aren't I? It's just that I lost my own baby once. I read your books so much, I hear your voice in my head. And it makes me think that you're a friend. You're not my friend. [phone ringing] Hi, you've reached Julie. Leave me a message. [beep] Jules, I think maybe it wasn't Kate who took Evan. I think maybe someone else. I don't know, just call me when you get this. Bye. Hi, you've reached Julie. Leave me a message. [beep] Julie. I really need you to answer. I need you to talk me out of this. Or into it. Please call me back. Please, right away. Okay, bye.

[phone ringing] Liz? Jules! It's a mess, everything's just a mess. What is going on, honey? I saw the news. I thought maybe it's not Kate, because she lost her baby. And the messages. Wait, just slow down. Messages? Can I come over there? Jeff's asleep. And the accident... I need to talk, you were right and... Yes, yes, of course honey. Please just get over here. It sounds like you desperately need some rest. I can't rest, I'm losing my mind. Thank you, Jules. Thank you for being my friend. Elizabeth, we have known each other Far too long to start thanking each other now. I'll be right there. I love you. Me too. Shh. Mommy's here. Yes I am. [muffled noises] Well, it seems Elizabeth is on her way, Which is awkward. I would have liked it much better If she had just gone to jail. Don't worry, honey. I can adjust. [doorbell ringing] Mr. Daley? Mrs. Daley? Detective bunch. No one's coming to the door. If we don't hear from her in an hour, get a warrant. Thanks, bill. [doorbell ringing] Oh honey... You look like you've been through an actual hurricane. Just come in. Oh sweetie, let's get you settled. Okay? The mountain house. Better days. [noises from upstairs] Yeah. Long gone. Tea's already on. Let's get you in a nice, hot shower. Okay? [muffled screams] Here we go. Get this warming up for you. Here we are. I'll just leave this here for you. Here you go. And some cute pj's. You know what? I think these are your color. There you go, okay? And... I will be back right back with tea. [teapot whistles] Here you go. With extra honey. Just how you like it. Thank you. More, it's herbal. I have to find Evan. Oh, honey. You are not going to be any good to anyone, All frayed and exhausted. When is the last time you got a full night's sleep? About six months ago. Exactly. I know, I am tired... Of course you are honey. It's barely six a.M. Here, one more sip. Just get a few hours, okay? And then we will go out full force, together. Okay? You know, Kate really was right. You did lead a charmed life, Elizabeth. Writer, wife, mother... And you never appreciated it. [muffled screaming] [baby crying] Did you find him? I didn't mean to destroy your eggs, honey. I swear I didn't. What? What are you talking about? I pulled that plug out of anger And I felt terrible about that. What are you talking about? And then... And then that horrible Dr. Merkel came in. You know she lied to me? Yeah. She said I was pregnant and then she said I wasn't. You're not preg... I lost my pregnancy And I didn't even get my best friend to cry with. Because I had to share you with that horrible whiner, Kate. Then you, You just had to write that stupid blog. Just gloating! Where's Kate? Oh it's a horrible story, honey. See, after you found Kate with Evan, You murdered her. No. And then, then you took all those sleeping pills. I mean, who could blame you? After all you've been through. Evan! No Julie, please... Do you think you're going somewhere? Oh, no... You aren't going... Anywhere. Goodbye... Elizabeth. [muffled screams] Oh, kitty Kate. You know, this just would've all been better With Liz in jail and Jeff dead. Then little Evan just would have come Straight to his godmother. No fuss, no muss. You know? And then you would've only had To take the blame for killing Jeff. But then Lizzie starting talking all crazy, moving to new york. Blah blah blah... And that well just would not do. So I had to adjust. And well, sadly... Now that Elizabeth is here To take revenge on mommy says no-no... Well, that means you... And you've gotta die. Yeah. Sadly. [tape ripping] [muffled screaming] Rock-a-bye baby, on the tree top. When the wind blows, the cradle will rock. When the bough breaks, the cradle will fall. And down will come baby. Oh these things. Cradle and all. Okay, there we go. Now let's go see daddy. [coughing] Kate... Kate! Come on, Kate! Come on, wake up. [gasping] Julie! I know. Okay, come on. I'm gonna turn myself in as soon as I can. Please just get to the house. Julie's gonna kill Jeff. Julie? I'll send someone there now. Thank you detective, I'm gonna call him right now. [phone ringing] Mommy will be right back. [alarm blaring] Liz? Lizzy? Well plans change, little one. Plans change and that is something You're going to have to learn in life. Plans change, and we... We adjust. Liz? [phone ringing] Julie? Jeff... Honey, are you okay? I'm okay, the alarm's going off. You're at Julie's? Any word on Evan? Mr. Daley? Police. The police are here? What's going on? I'll explain everything later. I love you, I love you so much. I love you, too. Don't thank me yet, Mrs. Daley. Escaping custody is a serious offense. You should have waited... Should have what? Gone to jail? Jeff would've been dead. You'd think Kate was the kidnapper And Evan would be with Julie. Is that what I should've done? All right. Now what I'd really like is for you To stay put and let me do my job so I can get your son back. Julie's on the run with an infant. Makes it hard to hide. We've put out an amber alert And airports and roads are covered. Those are very loose nets. She's your friend, Mrs. Daley. You tell me where would she go? Julie's family has a cabin near the lake Right by the Canadian border. I know the area, I can be there in an hour. I can be there in 30 minutes. I can radio for police in one. My car, I need my car. What are you doing, Mrs. Daley? There's so many cabins up there, I'd never be able to describe to them where hers is. I thought we agreed you'd stay put. I have to find my son. Look how well that's been working for you so far. No! Yes! You were unconscious five minutes ago. Detective, call Kate an ambulance! I don't need an ambulance. Shush! Kate, I love you. Go! You're technically still a fugitive, Elizabeth. You keep this up, You can get in a lot more than trouble. You could get hurt. Sorry. I have to do this. Here we go, here we go. We are home. I hope you are excited. This is going to be your very first boat ride. And your first boat ride with your new mommy. I'll be right back. You are going to forget all about your old mommy. Because you have a brand new mommy. Okay, I'll be right back. Mommy loves you. ♪ ♪ ♪ Where's Evan? Where do you think you're going? Canada, actually. Why are you doing this? If you were so angry with me, Why didn't you just say something? To you? All self-absorbed in your baby and your problems? You just had to write about it didn't you, huh? I became mommy says no-no To make you look at yourself, Elizabeth. To make you understand what being miserable feels like. Julie, no! Julie! You just had a baby, Liz. You think you're stronger than me? You have no idea how strong having a baby makes you! [struggling] You will never touch my baby again! I'll take it from here. Go get your baby. Look how big this guy's getting. Soon he's going to be brave and strong And ready to take on the world. Just like his mom. I hope so. Oh, it's Janet. Thank you so much for inviting me. No please, thank you for coming. I'm sorry. I was absolutely out of my mind that night. But here you go. First copy, as promised. Oh, thank you. Can I please use the b-word now? You know what's funny? Even after all of that. I kind of miss her. Yeah. Everyone can I have your attention? Our guest of honor. I've got a review from the new york times here: "in a departure from her usual outside looking in works, Elizabeth Daley's latest story Is wrought from the truest pain one can suffer, And the truest strength one can find, That of a mother saving her baby." Cheers to you. [applause] I'm actually going to have an orange juice. No? [baby coos] -Orange juice? -Yeah. Gonna have a brother or sister. [baby coos]
