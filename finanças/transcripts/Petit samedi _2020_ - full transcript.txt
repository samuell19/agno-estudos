- Damien Samedi. - ... is not available. Please leave a message after the beep. Hello, Damien. It's Mom. I'm calling to see if you'll be eating with me this midday. I haven't heard from you. But I know you're up. I'm still in my dressing gown, I've just finished breakfast. I'll start preparing the asparagus, I know you like them. You must tell me if you're coming. Perhaps you're busy, but you should have told me yesterday. When you call me, I always answer when you need me, so... Give me a call. See you later, sweetheart. Mom? Damien? - Damien? - Yes, Mom. Coming. - Everyone dies. - Are you dying? Everyone dies. Why do you ask me that every day? I ask because you tell me: "What would you do if I die?" That doesn't mean I'm sick. We're all mortal. But not right now! By asking me that every day, you actually make me feel sick. Understand? I'll catch cancer 'cos you get on my nerves so much. - Aw, come on! - I swear. You have to stop, or you stay away. OK, I won't. You'll be out, I'll stop seeing you. - I won't say it anymore. - Ask me one more time, the door is there, I'll lock it behind you. And I'll throw away the key. OK? Now basta. I've had enough. What a fuss about nothing! Nothing? You ask me every day if I'm sick. Frankly, do I look sick? Go ahead and tell me if I do. Look at your book! I'll look at whatever I want. If I do some gardening, will you give me 20 euros? If you actually do it. Not just give you 20 now. Because you forget and come back the next day for more. - Or you say you'll pay me back. - If I do it now, - will you give me 20 euros after? - After? - After the gardening. - Maybe. - But not before? - No. That won't work anymore. That's all in the past. Now it's: work first, pay after. - Get it? - Yes. I'm no fool. I need gas for the work. I'll pay for the gas, but I did that last time. - And after, you... - It's all evaporated! You use it to work for other people and I pay. It evaporated 'cos I left the cans open. Any old excuse... You little thug, you rascal. - I'm not a thug. - OK, go get a small can of gas. Then cut back the weeds. Gas for the machines and gas for me too. No way. Dream on. Except if you do some onion planting and so on, with me. - I'm haggling. - That's a ton of work! - I'm haggling. - All that for 20 euros? Plus the gas and the gas for your moped. That's at least 35 euros. Yes. That's the deal. - I'll think it over. - Me too. OK, I'll do it. All right, then. Give me five. Not with your horrid hands. Meanie. - Don't start... - You brought it up. Damien? It's Mom. I don't want to pressure you, about going to see the therapist. But it's for you. You're adult now, you must make decisions. You say you've had enough. As your mother, I want you to get past this and get better. I've already told you, when I'm dead I'll come and tickle your toes to remind you to take care of yourself. Goddammit! I'm never gonna make it. Goddam motherfucker! Why won't it go in? Right. Goddammit! That's better. It tilts really fast. Yes, it's a little sensitive. People tell me that. You're not gonna miss again? Look, I've got newspapers. We'll see what we can find. Each time you apply for a job, - they'll ask for your CV. - I know. So just fill this in. We'll do it nice and neatly. I did one at the job center but it wasn't well done. Still, you need one. They fixated on "parks and gardens", so I can't give it to just anyone. - I see. First name? - Damien. In case I forgot. Surname? Samedi. Address? Rue de la Cachette. - Why rue de la Cachette? - Number 8. Because that's your address. I'm not going to put your girlfriend's address. - Right, you fill in here. - Yes. Telephone number. And I know your email address. It'll need to be printed out. I'll type it. Presentation. Tell me. It's not about your good looks. It's about presenting yourself. We've already put your name. We'll put your age. You could put 43 years old. I'll take another sheet of paper, we'll combine them after. The date is important. Born on... - Come on. - 24th of December. - Yes? - 1975. - They need all that? - So you're 43. - No, 42. - 43. I never know the age of my children. I always think they're younger. We'll say you're in a couple, that can matter for a job. - I don't see why. - It just can. Presentation, that's done. Right? - Training, now. - Want my weight and height? No. - Training? - Yes. - What should I say? - Say what you've done. - In Suarlée. - Butchery, cold cuts... Do you need dates? We can look them up. That's a big job! We must have them somewhere. We'll manage. - Then you did archaeology. - No, first greenkeeper. For a year, at the Stu golf club. Is there a "d" at the end of Stu? No, it's "Stru". It's just "Stu"? I don't remember. We'll check. After that? Archaeology. We won't mention the shop in Liège. You only stayed 2 months. OK, then. Archaeology. You need the duration. Here it's 3 years. Here, 1 year, and then 15 years. - Should we mention lab assistant? - Yes. Put it down, then. - Please. - Right, now... That's training and experience. We've mixed them up. - No matter. - We'll clean it up. Tell me what else you can really do. Everything. Well, electricity, plumbing, plastering... - Electricity? Er... - A tiny bit. I've been waiting 15 years for you to fix that bulb in the hall. What I really need is a multipurpose position. - Where I do a bit of everything. - That's great. I'd be happy doing that. In a little old people's home. - What? - Let's get back to it. - Where were we? - With nice little old ladies. "My skills", we'll put it like that. Right, let's do this. Hello, sorry to disturb you. I'm calling for an appointment. For an addiction problem. It's quite bad. I'm a drug addict, so I need to see you to try to sort it out. Tuesday the 8th at 10 am. Yes, that's fine. Yes. My name is Damien Samedi, like the day of the week. Damien Samedi. Wonderful. My phone number is the one you can see now. Thank you, I'll see you Tuesday. Thank you. Goodbye. When someone gets crushed by a train, the family gets a huge bill. Rosaline got a bill of 180,000, right? No, 25,000 euros. It's shameful! Her daughter is crushed, and she gets a bill for the train delay. She didn't pay. I helped her to write to the queen. It wasn't his turn to go. - So what? - It bothers me. It's priority from the right, so it's his turn. If it's open, there's no train coming. - Right, let's drive! - Let's get this show on the road. Make sure you... You know... It's like a doctor, you mustn't hide anything. You have to say, whatever's on your heart. - Yes. - Otherwise, she can't help you. She'll take notes. She'll be amazed if I tell her everything. Imagine! Twenty years of drug addiction, my whole life! I hope she's up for it. And that she has enough notebooks. - It'll be OK, sweetie. - It has to be, Mom. - It'll be fine. - I've had enough. I have to get better. - There comes a time... - When it has to stop! - The elastic is so taut it'll snap. - I know. - I've never slackened the elastic. - That's right. You'll feel so serene. Now, you're always on the go. "I need some stuff. I must go there, make the call..." - It never stops. - I work for money... - It's hell. - I work for money to buy my stuff. Up early to think about where I can get something. - You ask your Mom. - I know. - I know. - We both suffer. - I realize that. - For your brothers and sister too. Though your brothers don't talk about it. I know they suffer too. It's tough on them and as they're quite shy, - they don't bring it up. - Why not? Perhaps because it hurts. I get it, but even so... It hurts me badly too. These days, you're a little more... I wouldn't say "open", but before you wouldn't talk about it. There was no way to discuss the matter. What could we say if you just left? They speak to me, sometimes. - They never tried to talk to me. Never! Except for Rieul, once. He was so upset, he cried and we never brought it up again. That's hard. He suffers because of it. They know I spend much more on you, in material terms, than on them. Emotionally too. I worry about you. And it's true that... OK, Mom, I agree, but I worry about you too. They never come round like I do, to say hi, or give you a hand when you need it. But you know... Oh, never mind. You're right. Yes, I use more. When I had a job, I didn't think about using. I got up at 6 am, went to work all day and I used afterwards. Since I lost my job, I use all day, every day. It's a pity. I need to be busy. I see. Are there days when you don't use? Not anymore. There used to be, but not now. If I don't use, I just sit on the couch at home. I can't do anything. I have no strength. I think constantly about using. So I have no life. It's sad to say, but when I use, I live my life. - You feel that it's like... - Gas in a car. You feel you're going somewhere. Do you know how long it's been since... When was the last day you didn't use? I don't know. I have to use every day. When I was working, I used after 4 pm, and if I didn't use between 4 pm and when I went to bed, the next day I couldn't go to work. I got withdrawal, the shakes, anxiety. I couldn't cope. I've been using every day for quite some years. I'm absorbing what you've told me. Do you still hide the fact that you use from any people? Everyone. Except people close to me. My family know I smoke, so it's not worth hiding it. But other people don't know. People whose lawns I mow would never imagine that I smoke heroin. Yes, in my everyday life, I hide it from everyone. Apart from those close to me. And they are, your brothers and sister. Yes, my brothers and sister. - And Gaëtane. - My girlfriend. It's not easy, hiding it from everyone. There are rumors in the village. Some people know that Damien Samedi is a junkie. Rumors about me are rife. You have to counter that when you meet people. Even people I work for... I suppose they know, we just don't mention it. It's not easy. Do you feel under pressure? Sometimes. I've been refused things. If I ask a favor from someone and they know I use, they can refuse outright. In retrospect, you think: "He knows you use, perhaps that's why he refused." That often happens. You talk of rumors in the village, did you grow up in that village? Not in that village. In the village where my mother lives. There are rumors because I've acted badly there, and fought a lot... Everyone thinks: "Damien's a junkie, he's a fighter, he's a good for nothing..." First off, they don't think a person can change. People take a very dim view of drug use. To them, it's very dirty... very bad. I can see why. - How do you feel about it? - Lousy. I made a big mistake. I couldn't bear junkies when I was young. Now I am one and I find it hard to accept. I don't think I ever will. So I want out. That's why I'm here. It's not easy at all. Can you say what you want out of coming here? I want to understand myself better, know why I do it. And get past it. That's the goal. It would be a good thing. You want to get beyond your heroin addiction. Have you ever tried to do so? I've tried. I've had treatment at the hospital in Namur. It was after a week of treatment for addiction. Five days of rehab. It didn't do any good. I went four or five times. They would pump me full of drugs. I didn't use because I was already high. When I left, they upped my dose of methadone and drugs and I'm worse than when I went in. Methadone is stronger... it's to be weaned off heroin. That's right. You feel it increases your addiction? Yes, because they increase the dose and when I get out, I use again. Five days isn't enough to get clean. I did another rehab at St. Martin Dave, in Namur. I was there three weeks and it went much better. I really got clean. I had quit methadone and heroin. But I have this alcohol problem too. I had a drink one day and relapsed totally. I got withdrawal and felt so bad I had to use. Even though I had quit for a few days. - A few days. - Not weeks or months. That would be a lie. Here's the question that could make you win: How long after the death of Jesus on the cross did the miracle of Christ's resurrection occur? Three days. Fréquence Plus. Three days. Send us an email with your answer, your name and details and you may be lucky enough to get a call live and win a trip to Lourdes. Paul? Hello? I can't hear you. Hello? Paul? Three days. I'm happy you called. Forty years ago, I won a trip to Lourdes. The kids were little, I couldn't leave them. So I gave it to my neighbor, who'd been wanting to go for a long time. And now... I long to leave and take that trip I missed forty years ago. I'll take advantage of being on air to thank my friends and family, my neighbors. May I, Paul? That's very kind. Thank you so much. Right, my sweetheart, Adrien, my sons, Gregory, Damien, Rieul, Quentin, my daughter Paloma, my grandchildren, Viktoria, Maxence, Elouan, Purdey... My brothers, my sister, my sisters-in-law, my nieces and nephews in France and in Belgium, my cousins, Aunt Henriette, Uncle André, Aunt Gertrude, Nènène and Pinpin in Vezin. Friends in the brass band, friends from the fairs, colleagues, ex-colleagues, Véronique, Marianne, Christine, Fabienne, my neighbors... Marie, Francine, Madeleine... And my friends in Bonneville. Jeanne from Bonneville. Poiette, who lives here in Sclayn. - Not everyone, surely? - Yes. Some of them. Why does it bother you that they talk about it? - You say everyone knows. - It makes me ill at ease. If no one knew, it would suit me fine. - It's taboo. - Yes, but people also say... Junkie is foul. People say: "He's so kind." No one ever says: "He's a nasty guy." Never. People don't say it to me, but the neighbors say to me: "Everyone says he's so kind." Martine says that. If you talk to someone about Damien in the village, they say: "He's a nice boy, always helpful." "Respectful of people with disabilities." You have a good reputation apart from the other thing... Yeah, I know. I know. - That's the way it goes. - Yes. - I'll tell you how I see it. - Go on. As time passes, I've found it easier to tell some people. - If they're well-meaning. - You tell people? - Yes. - No way! - Someone told me... - You're joking, right? We were talking about families and I said I had a child with a problem. - I explained what it was. - No. - Yes. - And? She was a good person. She told me she too had a problem with her child, who was an alcoholic and beat up his wife. Understand? You know, no one tells their life story without crying. You mustn't think that people's lives are a fairy tale. Even people with children who don't have your troubles, may not be all that happy. Everyone has their worries. And every family has its secrets. Big secrets, terrible things. You talk about it like that? It happened recently. I'm not the sort to chat in shops, I don't go out much, I'm a homebody. But an acquaintance asked how I was and the conversation turned to our children. It did us good. We were both well-intentioned. I wouldn't mention it to just anyone, someone I don't know, who wouldn't want to talk to me anymore. I talk about it to people who are kind. There, that's all I have to say. People don't avoid you, do they? Do they? I see what you mean. But when you meet someone, and they don't like you, what do they usually do? - "Hello, how are you?" - Yes. And then, behind your back... What if the woman you told about me - went blabbing about it? - No, I've known her 40 years. No. Hello, housewives, seize this opportunity. I'll get rid of your old iron, old copper, old zinc, old pots, old washing machines, old lawnmowers, old stoves, old motorbikes, old bikes... Children? - Children! - Children! - Can you hear me? - Can you hear me? Yes. - Have you seen Damien? - Have you seen Damien? He has a black moped. D'you know him? - A black moped. - You're making fun of me. Great. - Yes, children... - Answer me. - Have you seen Damien? - Yes, children... If you see him, tell him I'm looking for him. I will. - Have a good day. Goodbye. - Thanks, you too. He rides a black moped, he's often here. I've been looking for him for two days. He has a white helmet, jeans and brown boots, a blue jersey. A good-looking guy. Have you seen him? - Doesn't ring a bell. - How old is your son, madam? Wait, I always have trouble with my children's ages. Yes, 43 and a half. - That makes you laugh? - No, but... - Are you making fun of me? - At 43, he's not a kid. - Frankly, that's not nice. - Is he really 43? - You are real rotters. - Don't take it like that. - Well, really! - We agreed and... - Did he look OK? - Yes. He certainly hasn't put on weight. A little thinner. His father, his brothers, they're all thin. Not me. Yes, but... at one point, his face was a little rounder. Yes. - I felt he had... - Lost weight. I thought he was eating better. - It might not mean anything. - No, no. That's just how some people are. Yes, I'll go with him. He's in therapy now. Perhaps that's making him question things. Everything. Perhaps he needs to take stock. He's been in therapy for about a month. Perhaps he has to think things over. Perhaps he needs to take a step back from me. But I'd prefer for him to tell me. I'll take a step back. There's a big difference between feeling it and saying it. Maybe he can't tell you. - Leave him be. - But he'll need treatment. He has lots of addictions. He needs to get better otherwise, things will turn bad. Yes, of course. But he seemed OK. He didn't look... I've seen him looking much more agitated than that. He didn't seem... He'd clearly had a few beers. I looked everywhere for him, along the Meuse, in Thon, everywhere. Everywhere. People must think I'm the village lunatic. I ask: "Have you seen my son?" I described him. I went to the little shop in Thon... You must stop that. - I know. - You mustn't do that. It's difficult to remain indifferent. If he's taking a step back for the moment, - maybe that's what he needs. - That's true. And you pursue him. No, I don't really mean "pursue". That's a little harsh. You're right, Martine. Maybe I should accept. He has to... the bird must fly the nest. - Yes. - He's 43! Yes, but that was his choice. He's broken all the records. - He only left home recently. - I know. I quit smoking. Don't tell my kids, just give me a cigarette. All this is making me nervous. Thank you, Martine. I know I should let go a little. For both your sakes! I had some therapy and I remember the therapist saying: "It will change things in your life that you can't even imagine now." It's true. You move away from some people. You realize others are more important. Everything is called into question. Perhaps that's what it is. But it's hard on me because I'm used to seeing him twice a day, and suddenly he stops coming, doesn't answer his phone. - Don't torture yourself. - There's mail for him. It bothers me. I think there may be something urgent. But that's all... - Nice weather. - Great, isn't it? Let's enjoy it. Talking of therapy, after my first course, I left my husband. Me too. - Two good outcomes. - Yes. We're going to have dinner, Richard will probably come home. I'm not sure he will because it's already 6:45 pm. I have my doubts. But I hope he does, because I want to go to evening mass. If he doesn't come, I'll give the kids their dinner now and I'll be busy all evening. I'd like to do the ironing so that if Anne and Thierry come tomorrow I'll be free in the morning. You'll be disappointed to hear that I haven't lost much weight. My homeopath says it's psychological and that I need affection. I don't know if he's right. I hope that need will be fulfilled some day, then perhaps I'll lose weight. When I stuff myself with chocolate, it's as consolation for what's wrong at home. Your letter is finished. You say it's an old woman of 31 who writes to you, - but you look younger than me. - 31! We hope winter won't be too hard. It would be good if it was like last year because it wasn't too cold. But it's not looking good because it was minus 10° last week, with some snow and frost on the windows. The kids slept in my room as it was too cold upstairs. We slept up in the attic. The window was totally iced over and there's no heating. Not easy to get into bed! After half an hour you warm up, but getting into bed isn't easy. But such problems no longer concern you since you're in the sun. Good for you, because you're better off there than here for the moment. Today, Gregory is in a bad mood. Huh, sweetie? No? I have to erase it? There. He's very good, sitting in his little armchair. Huh, sweetie? In his little pajamas. No, we won't say that. Godmother can't hear you. No, she can't hear. - Erase everything. - You want me to erase everything? OK, I will. Damien's sitting in a chair with a sleeping bag on his lap. Right, sweetie? What are you up to there? What are you up to? Rieul and Quentin are asleep, they're always last up. Quentin would happily sleep until midday. But I don't allow that. They sleep early, they don't need to lie in. I'd like to get them dressed so we can go outside. We must enjoy this good weather and explore our surroundings. Damien, come and say hi to Aunt Mina and Pinpin. Hello, Aunt Mina. Hello, Pinpin. - Hello, Lionel. - Who is that? Come here. - Lionel! - No, who are you? Damien! Aunt Mina, I love you, please. What's the risk in taking care of yourself? The risk in taking care of myself? I would have to stop using. I'd have to change directions, take charge of my life and move forward. I'd like to remove the brake. But I can't find it. I just can't do it. Not at all. For me, all that is about addiction, it's the same thing. If I took care of myself, stopped using, quit drinking, took charge and found a quiet little job, I wouldn't hurt anymore. I could manage to feel better. But I can't do it. I live with the pain I have, I work with it, I use to reduce the pain, I use to be able to work. It's a big spiral that I can't separate out, tell myself to stop this or that. I can't do it. Why? I don't know. The longer you're addicted, the stronger the grip. Last time I quit, I couldn't kiss people hello. It was so powerful that I couldn't greet people. I couldn't kiss their cheek because my movements were erratic. I was afraid of butting someone with my head. It's tough. I just couldn't manage. When you stop using, it all comes flooding back: emotions, sensations, everything! It's too much to take. To the point that I couldn't talk to anyone. If I heard a silly little thing that wouldn't affect me now, I would cry. Any little thing. That's not easy. Especially for someone who never cries. It's not easy at all. In fact, it feels like a surplus of emotion, but it's normal life that returns when I stop using. When you use, it blocks all the little captors to open emotions, and when you return to normal life, it feels overpowering. I can't cope with that. For you, "normal life" is when you're not using? Yes, because right now, my life is not normal. I'm separate. - You OK, Damien? - Yes. You? - What are you thinking about? - My little voices. I have a kind one and a mean one. I don't know why it's on my mind, but I often get that. One says: "Don't do anything silly." The other says: "Go on, do it." - Don't you get that? - No. I do. Is it the devil speaking to you? I don't know if it's the devil. You could say that. The kind voice is an angel and the other is the devil. Are you all right, Mom? Therapy has got you thinking. - Right? - Yes. Going over... what can calm you or push you into doing something silly. That's good. I think so. I should tell her about my voices so she can teach me to listen to the good one. When you were born, you were a little cherub. A fat baby! People thought you were one month old but you were a newborn. Bald as a coot. Not a pretty thing. Like Kojak. - But you got handsome later. - Stop saying I wasn't good-looking. - Really! - What? It's not very kind. But you turned out to be my most handsome son. - I have handsome brothers. - Yes. When I was carrying you, I lost my sister and cried a lot. I think that's why you're going through this now. It's possible. It's no big deal. My little Mom. It'll work out. - I promise it will. - Yes. I'll make it all right. When you're fully healed, we'll take a trip together. - Where? - Paris. Anywhere. - Around the world. - Yes. Wherever you like. But not the mountains. Phrases like: "It's love that makes us love each other", what does that mean? Even in French, does it mean anything? "Love makes us love each other"? It's poetry. Yes, but what does it mean? That love is responsible and love is a... separate power or... Love exists and makes us love each other. I'm writing a song that might be finished. It's called "My Secret Life". I think it was 20,000 francs back then, to feed four kids. My brother Quentin lived with us back then. Well, my cousin-brother. So life wasn't easy. I remember she went without food to feed us. She did her best for us to feel good. We often went to friends in Thon who had a pool. We knew the kids well. We played there all the time. That was my childhood. Thon-Samson. She always did her very best for us. - And she still does. - You also told me that her life with your dad wasn't easy either. Not at all. With my real father. He was a skirt-chaser. He was a truck driver and picked up women. His woman, I mean. My mother just used to wait for him with us. My real dad was a heavy drinker. He drank... what's it called again? Kalimotxo, Coke with red wine. He drank two liters of red wine a day. He needed two liters of wine and one a half liters of coke. It was always tough with my real father. At one point, he hit her, he hit my brother Quentin. No one found it easy to get on with him. Of course. And how was it for you? It affected me badly. I wanted to leap on him and hit him to calm him down. But I was too small. Mom left him when I was nine. So I was too small to do anything. It's unbearable to see someone hit your mother. Horrible. That's how it was when I was a kid. Mom would protect us. We were a poor family. We were known as "the Samedi Brothers". The name "Samedi" isn't easy, kids can say cruel things. We were the "gypsies" of the school. We wore second-hand clothes, never classy new stuff. I was always protective of my mother because we didn't have any money and I thought we were different, less valid than others. We had no money, we weren't like others. And that bothered me. But I think it made me very protective of my family. Paloma, Gregory, Rieul, Quentin, everyone. Maybe I shouldn't have taken that role so much to heart. I worried a lot. But that's how it was. Run, Damien! Quick, quick, run! Get under the hosepipe. It's fun! Look at Shannah! Run for it, Kéké! Smile. That's life. Honestly, I have wondered if you wouldn't have managed better, if I'd thrown you out. We talked about it back then. I don't know. - Perhaps. - It was a month or so ago. Yes, maybe even before that. But I think that if you had done that, it may have been worse. So many people we know have died. - I may be dead too. - People of your age. They're no longer here. I didn't want to take that risk. Of you being out on the street. What do you think? You're right. You once told me that you might have made it. It preys on my mind. Perhaps if I'd said: "Damien, get out. Don't come back until you're well", maybe you would be out of the woods now. Maybe. Maybe not. It's hard to know. I was scared of the "maybe not". - What? - I was scared you wouldn't make it. - I think so. - That's why. - I'll get through this soon. - Yes. - I want to. - Good. I've a way to go, but I'm gonna make it. Subtitling: Tongues Untied
