And you wanna hate it cause it's not yours. And that's just too fucking bad. Well, actually it is mine. I own every song that you sing, you know that. You're gonna go back to Capital and you are gonna record the songs that you said you were gonna record. And you're gonna do them as they are demoed and charted. And you're gonna do 'em on a schedule and you're gonna do the physical and the photo shoot and the fucking interview and every thing that you hate because that's what you signed up for, okay. [Man] You're okay. Nah. (footsteps thudding) You nervous? Hell yeah, I'm nervous. (footsteps thudding) Is she in there yet? I don't fucking know, sometimes she just seems to disappear. I don't even know when she comes into the room. (footsteps thudding) Listen, assholes. She can handle it. She always has. What are you talking about? Yeah, you know the reason you're here, fucking babysitting her. You think she don't know? You think I don't know? You think the whole studio doesn't know? (Tommy exhales) (metal clanking) (papers rustling) I didn't know which brand you wanted. So I got you a variety. You sure did. (bottles thudding) Oh, sorry. Also got your bunch of juice to choose from. So where's the vodka? [Woman] They called and told me not to... - Didn't get it. - [Woman] Called. That's okay. It's not your fault. It's okay. (footsteps thudding) Hey Joel, Connor, come on out here and talk to me. (footsteps approaching) What are you guys so worried about? You worried about me? 'Cause I'm fine. Tommy, you know, we just thought that it'd be better to finish the session before... Sing a song for me. (all chuckles) How about "Strangers in the Night?" Everybody knows that song. Yep, let's kick it. (fingers clicking) Come on. (guitar music) - Tommy come on. - Please. (gentle music) Come on. - All right, - Sing. We get your point. (gentle music) Come on. Tommy come on. There's no reason for this. Look I know you can't sing. Everybody knows you can't sing, that's the point. Because you don't do what I do. You shouldn't be telling me what to do. That was never our intention. I just need you guys to understand what you're trying to do to me. And the only way I can imagine that happening, is if you do what I do. So please, step up to the mic and sing because if you don't sing, I won't sing. Now, count it off again, Grady. Just like that.

(footsteps thudding) Fucking insurance. Yes, fucking insurance. I mean, could we be any further away than who we were when we started doing this? [Walker] No, actually we couldn't, you know. Back then I actually loved you, now I can't stand the sight of you. I'm not talking about all that. I'm you know, I mean, look at all this. [Walker] Oh my God. Fuck it. Fuck what? Fuck what? I mean, you know... What? The business that you're in, huh? The business that... What? You one of those artists, who's like, you know, "Oh, I just missed the day, man. I miss the day when we used to work in that little studio in my garage, man. Remember those days, man, it was so much better coming up." I'm so sick of this shit! Do you really miss those days, huh? Do you really miss those days? - Tell me? - Maybe. Because I remember a guy named Dave and you had no problem throwing his ass out, cause he couldn't get you where you wanted to be. - I know... - So you are where you are. Aren't you sweetie? [Tommy] But I'm not who I was 20 years ago. (door opens) [Walker] But that's you. [Tommy] Yeah. [Walker] That was your choice. [Tommy] But you're here. [Walker] This is not about me. [Tommy] Why are you making it about you? [Walker] You are not who you were 20 years ago. You are not that Memphis girl. No, I'm not. You are where you are. You need to show some gratitude and stop this shit. Maybe you're right. Maybe I should, show some gratitude. All love and gratitude. You're right. (Tommy chuckles) All the... Tommy, Tommy, Tommy. What happened, huh? What's going on? I'm just not in the mood. Tommy. - What's going on? - Just not in the mood. So what do you wanna do? You wanna go walk downtown, find those guys you like to hang with and kill yourself, huh? - Is that it? - Kiss my ass.

No, no, no, I'm not the only one - that's been on this ride. - For twenty fucking years. Fucker. This is your fucking dream. Whether you wanna realize it or not, this is it. You did it. I did it with you. You're not the victim of the story. Stop acting like this. Don't you ever feel any pain? Oh my God, I am so fucking sick of you. I am so fucking sick of you. I mean, this is so boring. Don't you get tired of this? - Don't you get tired? - Do you think I'm sick and tired? Don't you fucking get tired of this shit? Don't you? (footsteps thudding) You fucking do your physical. You stay the fuck away from me. - Just go do your goddamn physical. - Fuck your physical.

So when the show is over. When the lights are out and people have gone home, the only way to repeat it, is to go for the whiskey, pill, (lighter flickers) Smoking.

That's what they're gonna wanna talk about. And to be perfectly honest, I don't know why she needs to do it. All the dates are booked and she's pretty much sold out. So get off her back. She needs to talk about the girl because it's pretty much taking over the tour and the record. We just need to just put it to bed. She's not gonna talk about it, so that's that. Okay guys, she's also going on tour to sell records and you don't have a record to sell and that's a problem. You're such an asshole. That's enough. Okay, look. Cole, are we close to finishing? Well, she's working and it's really good stuff. And there's no schedule for that. [Walker] Why haven't I heard anything Cole? She's not ready. All right. What else? The photo shoot an interview with Oscar Mitchell. That's confirmed. That's exciting. Well, it's not exactly confirmed, confirmed. I mean, she's probably gonna do it. She really likes Oscar. [Stacey] It's important. No, I know, I know. I know that and as I said, I think she's gonna do it, so. How do we confirm, I think? She doesn't really care what you think and she's probably gonna do it. [Walker] Stacey, you wanna continue please? Yes. She doesn't want a new cover, she wants the one that she picked the same as the billboard. Whoa, whoa, whoa. The one where she's smoking and in real fur? I don't think so. - [Stacey] That one. - [Walker] I think it's really good. - No. It's great. [Timothy] Inappropriate. It's edgy. Is she gonna show? I don't know what you want me to tell you, Walker. You've known her for twenty years, so... she'll deliver. She always does. Okay, great. Thanks so much everyone. Cole, can you stay behind a sec? (zipper closes) (footsteps thudding) I heard you and Tommy put on quite a show at Capital. Whatever. I'm over it. [Cole] What's that mean? It means I'm over it. It means I'm done. I don't wanna work with her again. This is last record, last tour, last everything. I'm absolutely done with this. Don't don't even joke about abandoning her. She can't take that. You just finish the record, okay? [Tommy] I know what she's thinking. I should find her. I should save her. I should stay with her. I should never let her outta my sight. She's wondering maybe it's the girl at the concert that killed herself. She's wondering maybe it's her fault. Come on, Walker. Find it. Come get me. Find me. At least you'll know you tried. Coffee. (footsteps thudding) Coffee, coffee, that one. Dude, like she's gonna show. Pull a fucking gangster dude. Yeah dude, badass. Yeah, totally. You know, she's fucked up. She's a drug addict, whatever, who cares? I love her. Yeah. You know my mom finally divorced my shit bag dad, 'cause of her last song? - Yeah. - Dude. (footsteps thudding) [Timothy] Goddamn it. She'll probably be here. Oh you think this is a big fucking joke? This is all on us, okay. This is our money, not yours, not his, not hers. And where's Oscar? He's ten minutes away. Well, it's pretty clear that she's not showing up. It's been two hours. What? Don't look at me, it's not my fault. Whatever. You and Walker just keep ignoring the damage. I have never seen anything like it. Let me tell you something... she's over. Neither one of you guys wanna admit that. Fuck you, Timothy. (footsteps thudding) (ice clanking) (beads jingling) Hey, brother man. Hey, Tommy. Good to see you. So, new record? Tour? What's this, fourteenth? About that... You're happy with it? Yeah. Tell me about it. (Tommy laughs) I think this might be my last record, man. [Oscar] Why? My heart's given out. Nothing in it anymore. [Oscar] That's not so good, Tommy. Yeah, I keep looking and looking. Nothing in there. Can hardly hear it. [Oscar] What are you hearing? Mostly old stuff. (metal clanking) Mama's voice. Santa Boat Creek. Tony Jo.
