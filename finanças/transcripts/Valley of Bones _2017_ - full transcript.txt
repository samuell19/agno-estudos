Cal. You remember that rancher guy you had working for you, back when? That's him. Look, I gotta get in touch with his brother. He was some kind of a dinosaur hunter, right? Him and his wife? Brothers said that. Now, about the wife... Hey, John. You in there? Come on, Dr. Olson. Got something we gotta discuss. Not Olson anymore, Terry. All right, doc. Old habits. So, you wanting something or you just come by to shitheel me? The oil company's moving in. All right. Signed off on the land, yesterday, so... You flirt. The bakken don't extend this far south. Hey, hold off, now, doll. As long as you've been out here, how much have we seen from all your fossil hunting? All right, well, think it's time for you to move on. You're right. Hey. You want me to make you something to eat? Want to know how the dig went? It was a total disaster. Thanks for asking. Can I come in? So, whatcha working on? Aquarius? Yeah, the spacing's good. You gonna make a wish on one? That's stuff for kids. Granddad didn't get you too far in this book, huh? Hmm. He tried. Hey, Ezekiel. Wanna see something? What is it? Check it out. Another one of your dinosaur things? Yeah. Yeah, kind of. It's from the dig. I was hoping to find... I got homework. Okay. Do you wanna at least know what species they are? Mom... I'm not gonna know for sure until I extract the entire embryo. That's cool, mom, but I really have homework, okay? I have a strong theory they are triceratops cubs. Isn't that cool? You wanna hold a triceratops cub? Maybe later. Ezekiel. Come on, this is your chance to hold a piece of... Mom! I don't want to hold your stupid thing. Ezekiel! What's happening? What the hell did you just do? When did you get home? It's the best goddamn piece - I found today. - Hey... I wasn't interested. I said no! What, uh... Well, welcome home, Anna. I'll put the little bruiser to bed. I guess that didn't go so well, huh? Well, dad, you're the one who's always telling me I oughta try and get closer to the boy. Well, yeah, by asking eze what sort of things he likes. Not by forcing on him the stuff that you do. I have no idea what he likes. I think that's what I mean. Look... it's getting a little late. Why don't you go tuck your son in and I'll finish up. Okay. You know, a nice thing about the past, it will still be there when you wake up. Yup. Worst thing, too. Hey, Ezekiel. I'm... I know it was an accident, okay? Hey. Let's get to bed, okay? Is that... It's my watch. Well, it's broken. Don't you want another one? It's dad's. Yes, I know it was. Where did you get that? Hey. We're not open. Nate, it's me. We're not open. You got my voice mail. What? You get my voice mail? No, I... look. I don't want you hanging out with... I don't want you giving stuff to my kid. The watch? Jesus Christ! This couldn't wait a bit. That could have waited till tomorrow morning, huh? No, Nate. Because i distinctly remember already having this conversation. I don't want you hanging out with Ezekiel when I'm out of town. When you're out of town. I'm the boy's uncle. Someone oughta be spending time with him when you're out for months on end, digging around in boneshit nowhere. Mmm-hmm. Okay, great. Thank you very much. Nate, I realize Ezekiel's the only family you got left, but I don't need parent... I don't need parenting advice from you. Okay, so, you called me, twice. I'm here. What the hell did you want? Well, if you had listened to my voice mail, we could have done it over the phone. Jesus. You wouldn't have to bother coming down here. But since you're here, have a beer. Thanks. This that ranch you used to work on? Napping around on? Uh-huh. Okay, and? Well, I told you all about it in the voice mail. We could go over it again if you'd like. Hey, you. It's me. You got me on your phone as "son of a bitch"? Would you be quiet? I'm trying to listen to you. Well, you're not answering, obviously, which means you're probably still, I don't know, mad, but my old boss got a call from one of them oil rig guys, Wes McCoy. Thinks he might have stumbled on something. He found a tooth. Big one... You hung up on me. A tooth, Nate? You've got to be kidding me. Yeah. Pretty cool, huh? No. Because a therapod tooth means shit. If it's even what they think it is, carnivores shed them suckers like mad. It's probably nothing. Yeah, well, it could be something. Great. Yeah, it's great science there, genius. You know, for somebody who doesn't like bringing up Ethan, you sure sound a heck of a lot like him. Yeah, maybe I'm no scientific genius. If I was, I wouldn't have to bring you in on this deal. Jesus, Nate, what do you want from me? I'm just suppose to drop everything and rush up there? Dude, you got nothing to drop. I mean, what's the worst that could happen? Go up there, you don't find anything. I'm still a son of a bitch. What the hell. God damn it, Nate. Is that a yeah? Yeah. You're coming with me, though. Sure. Somebody's gotta introduce you to the ranch owner. No. Because when it turns out to be nothing, I'm gonna need someone within swatting distance. I'll pick you up tomorrow morning, then. Tomorrow. Well, come on. This is ridiculous. You just got back. Dad. Dad, it's probably just for the weekend. Three days, tops. Well, maybe that's good, then. 'Cause this way, you'll be back on Monday, right? Please, dad. I know what you're gonna say. That he should come with... Yeah, that he should come with... Of course I'm gonna say that. Why the hell not? You know exactly why the hell not, dad. Because it's the badlands, not a playground. Jesus. There's wild animals, crap weather. The list goes on. This ain't funny, Anna. You're telling me. It's a long list. Anna! Hey. Susanna! Hey. Morning, bill. What do you want from me, dad? It ain't what I want. Now, I went to the trouble of packing him a little bag. What about school? I went to the trouble of notifying his principal. Well, you went to quite a lot of trouble, seems like. Listen, kiddo, you're gonna have to deal with this sometime. You can't go running off with your rocks and bones, and pretend that you're raising a son. Guilt ain't the same as protection. Right. But that doesn't have anything to do with the cartel. It doesn't have anything to do... It has everything to do with the cartel. The boom brought overpopulation. They brought the trade of crystal meth to an all-time high, and now, you got these Mexican cartels. They're up here and they're trading guns. Or drugs. Right, but the cartel has been here since the '90s, at least, just didn't hear about it regularly. You hear about it now. Do you realize that we have gangs competing for territory all across the state? And I'm not just talking about williston. - I'm talking about... - I'm just saying... I'm talking as far east as Fargo. You had 'em, right? If you wanna take the power away from the cartel, you have to take away their market. It's just, I mean... Jump. Look out. Crap. Hey. Easy on the language. Billy can say it, and he's only seven. Oh, yeah? Let me get a game. Show you how the pros do it. Crap. Anything else for you two? Just keep 'em coming. Hi, hon. So, McCoy. Word down the line is, you think you found yourself something out in the badlands. I know I got something down there, so, hon, the question is, what's it worth to you? So? Carnivore species were known to shed their teeth all over the goddamn place, but this still has its root intact. That means the incisor was still attached to the dinosaur when it died. You're saying there's maybe more. There may be a lot more. See? What did I tell you? She's out there. How do you know it's a she? I don't know. I've just been calling it a she, like a... Well, like a captain. White whale kind of shit. You know what I mean? Okay, well, you're not wrong. This here? T-Rex tooth. It's a fairly large specimen, too, which among tyrannosaur breeds means, yeah, it's probably female. Cool. A t-fucking-Rex? I'll be damned. Hey. Dead man. You're supposed to be gone. But here he is. Here I am. I'm kind of in the middle of something here, slick, all right? Yeah, I see that. I didn't mean to intrude on your date. But we've seen you now. Let's go, Reese. Next time, they ought to bury you deeper. So, good. Great, roots, teeth, all that. That's fucking awesome. That something i ought to be concerned about? I've never seem 'em before in my life. Just a couple of dumb drunks... 'Cause I don't know you. I don't know what the hell this is. But I do not need that shit on my dig. It's Ace. Okay. He's all right. You're all right. See? See? Friends. Buddies. Right? Yeah. You've seen me. Well, well. Nate Olson, as I live and shit. Kimberly. You meet with McCoy? She did. Mrs. jordall. Hi, it's a pleasure. Kimberly, please. "Mrs." is for spinsters and suits. We got dirt under our nails, don't we, doctor? Anna, here, she... You don't have to give me a big spiel, Nate. I know who she is. You're the paleontologist, yes? The one that was thrown into prison for digging up bones on government land. Actually, I didn't know it was blm land at the time. I'm sure there's a pretty story. There always is. Look, I know how this works. Someone like you comes and digs up the bones, and we're supposed to arrange for a broker to find a buyer in Dubai who wants to be the only guy on his block with a dinosaur in his living room. What I want to know is, why should I let an ex-convict monkey around on my land? I need this. If that Rex is down there, she's been trapped for 67 million years. I think she deserves a new life. Well, I certainly hope she gets one. I look forward to meeting our dinosaur. Thank you. Not her. I can still... What? Don't "what." The book. The book is "what." Why did you pack it? Well, it's just a little something I got for eze when you... I know what it is. I don't know why i packed it exactly. I just thought maybe, I don't know... Might be a little middle ground for you two. So, you staying? It's a little premature before I've seen the bone bed. But looks promising. Oh, honey, that's great. I'm really happy for you. So, do you think eze's gonna be staying with you? If it turns out, uh, I'll think about it. Just don't know if he'd want to. You two just need some time. He's young. He just seems older, that's all. Yeah. He always does. Yeah. That's the way it happens. They grow up. You have a good night. Give that boy a big squeeze from me. Good night, dad. Bye-bye. Hey, what's up? I just got off the phone with the shift manager over at Scofield. He said one of his drillers didn't show. Fucking Scofield. So, I'm going to need you to fill one of these for me. The boom's slowing up. The company's cracking down. It ain't personal. Hell, they're testing everybody, even folks who got no history of abuse. Of course, I could always say you never showed this morning. Yeah. You like that one, huh? You... You like horses? Yeah. They're okay. When you feed 'em, make sure you hold your hand flat so you don't get bit. I'll be out of your hair in a couple of days, then you don't have to worry about anything. No, I was just... Be careful, that's all. Mmm-hmm. Did you and dad use to ride horses when you were working? Sometimes, yeah. Yeah, when we could. Cool. What's that you're playing? I'm not sure you could call it playing just yet. That's a lot better than I can do. Couldn't find my sorry way around a kazoo, let alone that monster. I got a little girl back home. A bit younger than your boy. Emily. Get to call her, or whatever, now and again, when I can sneak it past her mom. So, you know, just thought I'd learn a little ditty she liked. A lullaby. That's nice. Nah, it's stupid. Hey! What gives? We're burning daylight. Get a move on. It's up ahead. No, she won't. So, you really think you can have her out inside a month. Well, we'll have to. It's late in the year for a dig of this size. Over there, please. It's not unheard of. We'll have to have her out before winter, though, or, we're looking at having to break till next season. This your shit? Thanks, slick. That is mighty impressive, doctor. Don't get too excited. It's going to take us a minimum of two years in a lab before she's ready for auction. All right, well, I'll have my man draw up the papers. Last thing, shares. We split our 70. You keep your 30 all to your lonesome. I see. Sacks of money from Dubai are always an option, Kim. Like hell. Let Dubai dig up its own tyrannosaur. This gal's American. Hey, stranger. You gonna join civilization? I'm good right here. Thanks. This okay? Let's see. What have we got here? We got some from our gal. And... oh. Some fragments of edmontosaurus annectens. I'm in second grade. Sorry. Duckbill. T-Rex breakfast. Nice find. Do you think dad would have been proud of me? Anna, I need your eye over here, please. Whatcha doing there, eze? Find something? Susanna, have a beer. Relax. Thank you. This is going great. Look at this. Hey, guys. Come look at this. Goddamn, look at that skull. Jackpot. What are you doing up here? I get one bar up here. I thought I'd check the weather. What are you doing? Checking the weather. What do you think? Those clouds sure look mean. I don't know. Remember a couple of years ago. We had that big storm. Yeah. Yeah, I remember. You were talking in your sleep. Yeah. I had a bad dream. About dad? What? No. No. It's okay. You can talk about him around me. Me... me and uncle Nate do. Talk about him. Hey. Come here. I'm telling you, she's cheatin'. You just got a shit poker face, that's all. Would a guy with a shit poker face throw that? Yes. That's actually exactly what he would do. Needless to say, i called your bluff. Did you see how I did that? Well, we're laying 'em down there, buddy. What you got? Look at these. King pokerface over here. Layin' it down full houses, like it ain't no shit. Mmm-hmm. Yeah, I bet you wish you were playing for more than just butterscotch and bottle caps, huh? You wanna put some real money on it? Yeah, I don't think you could afford it. Well, the way you're playing, I don't think I'm the one that needs to be worried. Well, I'm not out yet. I see I've got some more bullshit here in my pocket that I found out in the field. We can get back in this game here. That's my ante. Now look at that. Found that out there, too. What the hell is that? Ask him. Nate, this isn't funny. Get that off the table. Now. You don't bring that nasty shit out here around my nephew. You understand me? Huh? Billy, you hear? I said, don't bring that... You actually think I'd give that shit to a kid? You crack head... Boys! Dad. Hey, baby girl. Am I calling too late? I'm not a toddler anymore. And it's Friday. I can stay up till 9:00. I'm sure you can. I just don't want to get in trouble with your mom is all. You're always in trouble with mama. Oh, that's right. Is that the pup? Is she around? Yeah. Out in the yard. Must have thought she saw something out back. She was crazy begging to go out before you called. That's too bad. I was hoping to say hi. I'll pass it along. She misses you. Well, you tell that shaggy son of a bitch i miss her, too. Hey. I got something i want you to check out. I gotta get ready for bed. That's okay. That's all right. You just get yourself tucked in and listen. All right? McCoy, storm's comin'. We're headed back to... You always snooping around everybody's tent, or am I just lucky? We've been calling you. What the hell was that thing? Can I show you something? Yeah. This your Emily? That's her playing with a dog there. We call her snickers. She wanted to name it after something she liked. She wanted that dog in the worst way. McCoy. Are you in some kind of trouble? She's so smart, too. She does these little, like, vocab crosswords. She got "panoply." Little eight-year-old kid, i don't even know what a panoply is. Wes. She's a lot smarter than her old man. I used to work for some bad people. Cartel kind of bad. I got caught doing a run and did some time for it. Cost 'em a lot of money. She don't know nothing about those people. Why should she? It makes me sick. 'Cause I did that. You can keep trying to get... Just keep trying to get ahead of it, somehow. I tried to quit, tried to... But it's... I don't know. Sometimes I wonder, maybe it'd be best if I'm not around. Is that really what you want? I, uh... I spent some time inside, too. Three years. No shit. Yeah, the judge wanted to make an example of me, I guess. It didn't even matter that I was pregnant. With... Yeah. I never even got to hold him. Jesus. He went to live with my dad 'cause my husband was already out of the picture at that point. Then the FBI came down on us, and it was just me left to take the fall and I kept saying I didn't know it was federal land. It was Ethan who knew. But I don't even know if that's true. Maybe I did. Maybe I know I did. I didn't even see Ezekiel till after I got out. You know, not 'cause i couldn't, but... And then when I did get home, he didn't even know who I was. So, I spent every spare moment out here 'cause it just seemed like it was better somehow. For both of us. Is that still what you think? Anna, you coming? If we don't leave now, we ain't leaving. Yeah. We're coming. Ah... Heard about the ruckus. That something i ought to be worried about? He'll cool off. Long days. Lotta work. Mmm-hmm. Did Nate ever tell you how I happened to come to know Wes? McCoy? I mean, i guess I assumed... I'm his sponsor. So, that means... Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm. Well, you know, I mean, we were all young and dumb once, right? Anyway, I just thought it best you know it. Ain't nothing I've ain't handled a million times before. Ain't nothing i can't handle now. You shouldn't sneak up on folks. Oh, sorry. Come in out of the cold, at least. It's pissing rain outside. So, what's the deal? You moping? I don't know. Well, I ain't gonna yank it out of you. Didn't wanna come with, at first. Mmm-hmm. And now you're glad you did? Well, it makes me miss my dad. Shit, kid. You know, dads ain't always all they're cracked up to be. Yesterday don't mean Jack. What's that you got there? Oh, somebody told me i was supposed to give this to you. Who? Someone from the ranch? Uh, yeah, maybe. I haven't seen him before. Look, uh... Get inside. Head off to bed. Okay. And don't talk to no one else you don't know. Fuck! Put your boss on the phone, slick. I got his bones. You heard what I said? I'm tired of talking to the fucking help. El papa will come to you. Fuck! Oh, what did they do to you? Well? It's tight. You done good, dinosaur lady. Thanks, dinosaur fella. Oh. I've been promoted. I'm gonna go grab my pack, then we can caravan outta here. You got the keys to the truck, right?. Got it. Right, let's get going. Hey, eze, come on, let's go. Okay. You got all your stuff packed? Nope. Come on, let's load up. I wanna get out of here before the sun sets. Okay. You got everything? Good boy. Come on, let's go. Hey, Nate... Look, man, I just wanna... I wanna say I feel bad for how things got outta hand at the fucking card game. No hard feelings. Nate! - Nate! - Eze, stay down. Ezekiel, get down! - Ah, shit. - Nate! You get in the car and keep your head down. Nate! What the hell is going on? - Stay right there. - You hear me? Shit. Mom! Are you guys okay? Oh, no. No, not the keys. Anna! Anna, what are you doing? Get in the truck and get outta here. - Keys! - I lost the keys in the... - McCoy. - What the hell is he doing? You motherfuckers wanna kill me? You better aim straight! You hear me? Stay right there. You're okay. Mom! I can't find 'em. It's not worth it, Anna, come on. We can't just leave her here. I knew we never should have trusted that junkie son of a bitch. Ouch. Ouch! Yeah, all right. I know, it will sting like spitfire, but at least it won't fall off. I still can't believe we just left her out there. Well, we have worse things to worry about than that dinosaur, doctor. Where are you going? McCoy ain't back yet. Good. That's enough, okay? From both of you. Kim, this whole thing is his fault. Well, I know that, but I'm gonna go look for him anyway. What you got there? He said it was for good luck. Who did? Fuck. Wait. Wait. Wait, god damn it! Just wait a minute and listen to me, yeah? Just hablar for a fucking... Goddamn... English, English, right now. It's over, gringo. You make this easier on yourself. You, or your daughter. I can still pay, all right? I can. Don't be a coward. Be a good father and die. No. No, no. I have the t-Rex. It's there. I have it. Here? Huh? Pictures. Huh? See? Just like I said. That's from today. It's already loaded up. What I'm supposed to do with a big, dead lizard? Huh? You know exactly fucking what. Auction it off. Black market? The last one that complete was an $8-million dead lizard. Don't be stupid. You kill me, I'm just another body. The grave out in the badlands, what's that worth? You let me get this fossil for you, you'll get a hell of a lot more than I owe you. Two ways to pay. It's the dinosaur. Or it's me. But you leave my kid out of it. You're in tight spot to be making threats, hombre. Then do it. Tonight? Tonight. At the oil rig. You'll get it tonight. How many albums you got in this shit house? I don't know. Seven. Uh-huh. Well, you better go get my lizard because you only got six-and-a-half tapes left. We gotta go back out there. Are you nuts, Anna? You wanna just leave her out there? We already did all the work. Okay? She's just sitting out there, exposed in the truck. Which you don't have the keys to, if you remember. Nobody else is gonna get those keys. Come on, hey. Just relax. Go inside. Think about your son. Oh, my god, you're right. Good. Thank you. No, Nate, he'd fit. What? Ezekiel would fit into the fissure. He could get the keys. Are you insane? I got shot out there. I just got shot out there. You know the bullet was meant for McCoy. They're not still out there. They're not thinking we're gonna come back tonight. You're not going back out there. Ezekiel can't go back out there. Yes, I can. I can help with this. I can. No. No, eze. You can't. Mom, you said you wanted my help. Let me do this. Anna. Anna, what are you... Fuck. Okay, you're doing great. Where are they? They can't have gone too far. Ezekiel. Ezekiel. Move back very slowly. I'm going in there, Anna. Get him out of there. Ezekiel. Get out of there, now. Eze, come on out of there. Mom. No. Come on, baby. Mom. Baby, come on. - Come on. Ezekiel. - Help. Come on. Give me your hand. Give me your hand. I'm stuck. We got you. We got you. Call for help. Try to stay calm, Anna. You hear me? - Anna. - Nate! Call someone. Are you bit? Ezekiel, did it bite you? Mom, I don't... Oh, god. Mom. You're gonna be fine, baby, okay? Where's the... There's only one. Okay. Okay, ready? Hold still. Okay? Okay. Mom, I broke dad's watch. That's okay, baby. I'm here. I'm here. Mom, I did it. I know, sweetheart. No, I really did it. Yes. Yes, eze. Come on, you piece of shit. Give me something. Can you hear me? Eze's snake-bit, we're up at the dig site. You gotta send an ambulance... Is everyone okay? Nate? Nate, goddamn it, talk to me. Nate. Nate. What's going on over there? Hello? Nate. Uncle Nate. Nate, where are you? Are you gonna be okay? Yeah. Yeah. I'm gonna be fine. Just have to find your uncle and get to a hospital. I got the second bite, so I got the least of the venom. I'm gonna be fine. We just gotta get out of here. Okay, stay here. Keep an eye out for your uncle. I'm gonna go find a flare and flag him down. Okay. Okay. Where the hell is that stupid thing? Nate. We gotta talk. McCoy! Where the hell have you been? What was that back there? Don't get all excited. People were shooting at us. We could have died. People have died. Where's Nate? You come diggin' in my shit, I come diggin' in yours. McCoy? I want those bones. You give me what's mine. I don't know what you're talking about. She's not yours. Bullshit, she ain't mine. She's been under my feet. McCoy, she isn't... I found her. Me. And I'm taking her, all right? And I don't give a good goddamn what I gotta do to do it. Now, you still gotta be all mean and unpleasant? You don't gotta do this my way. You can do it the nice way. Give me the keys. Don't be stupid now. Use that big science brain you got, and don't be stupid. I think there's been a misunderstanding. Nobody's trying to cheat you... I ain't got a couple of years, dinosaur woman. I got fucking five seconds. Just settle down. Nobody's mad. Nobody's getting excited now. Huh? Friends. Buddies. Right? Okay. Uh-huh. McCoy: I told you i didn't want it this way! Mom! I told you you didn't want it. I know you laugh at me. I know you laugh. Daddy's coming home now, baby girl. Go. Go. Close the door, baby. Mom! No! Mom, help! Shut up. Mom. No. She's mine, god damn it! You'll bring her to me. Anna. Anna, where's eze? Nate. Nate. Come on. Come on. He took my boy. It's gonna be all right. Your mom's gonna do the right thing. You'll see. No! Stop! Did you get bit, too? Ezekiel? Ezekiel? Hey. I meant what I said. You get me out of here, you fuck! Is she safe? Is she safe? Get out. Shit. It should have just stayed in the ground. Ezekiel? Ezekiel? Baby, are you okay? Wake up. Say something. Ezekiel? Say something. Wake up. Mommy. You scared the bejesus out of us, kid. All out of bejesus now. Mom. Mommy. Mom. Mom. Mommy. Have you seen this pile of crap? Which pile of crap was that? Dubai, huh? Well, I guess it doesn't matter, really. We're in the badlands, after all. There's always more bones. Should we tell the doctor? Nah. She's busy. So, it's like the rings in a tree? Exactly. Yeah, the rocks tell us how old the earth is. Each line represents a milestone of a few million years. They tell us more about who we are, where we came from. Do you ever wish you can go back? See it yourself? Once, maybe.
