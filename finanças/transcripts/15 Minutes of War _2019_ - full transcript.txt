THEY ARE TURBULENT TIMES, OF DISPUTES BETWEEN TWO WORLDS, OF ECONOMIC CRISIS AND BLOOD CONFLICTS. TERRORISM REACHES EUROPE AND THE MIDDLE EAST DAILY. WELCOME TO THE YEAR OF 1976. IN DJIBOUTI... THE LAST FRENCH COLONY. WE WANT OUR INDEPENDENCE EVEN IF IT COSTS OUR BLOOD -Good morning, François! -Good Morning! -Good morning, François! -Good morning, François! -Good morning, François! -Good Morning. Good morning, Louise. Where is your brother? Is sick? Clear. He's never sick. He warms up the thermometer and pretends. And Mom never realizes. But who studies a lot and will be a doctor or astronaut, while the brother stays at home with Mom? It is true. Hi, Zyed. How are you? Well, what about you, Mrs. Jane? Very well. Have a good day, Zyed. TUESDAY, THURSDAY, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 1976 -Oi, François -Olá, Bernardo. How's it going, Gary? -Bernardo, The Leopard. Sit down, Bernardo. Do not move, or I'll shoot. You understood? Understood? Gary! Nobody move! Silence! Frontiers of Somalia. Now! Right. Gary! Gary! "How many were missing for you?" -Four. -And to you? -All of them. -Teacher please. -I'm going. Sir? Are not we going to school? Shut up! Listen! Everybody sit down! No fuss! If no... If it slows down, it will die. If you stop, you're going to die. Fast, faster. Do not let them pass! Fast! Fast! Close the borders! Understood? Understood! Get the run! Not! Not! Idiots! Do not close the border! Get up from there. Do not waste my time. Come here. The children. Do you see the soldiers? Tell them to go. Now! You understand? Right. -Now! -It's all right. 15 MINUTES OF WAR BASED ON REAL FACTS It's good? -Take it easy. -But it hurts. Show me, I'll tell you if it hurts. -What they did? -What? They did it the wrong way! I've never had appendicitis. You mean you're still a kid? -Exactly. -Then that's it? I am a child? Mr Gerval? Call for you. -Take it. -Thanks. Thank you. Yes? All right, thank you. Pierre, it's André. Gather Lorca, Campère and Larrain. Up until. 21 hostages. All are children. "Between France and Somalia. "Any demands?" Autonomy and immediate departure from France, release of political prisoners. Nothing new, nothing acceptable. Three children are American citizens, so the Yankees are pushing us. I spoke to General Favrart, commander of the Armed Forces. They will settle in the place, but they will hardly intervene. -Because? "Most children are his base. And what would they do? Would they go with guns and bayonets? That kind of thing is not their forte. The President's advisers are scared to death. If we negotiate, we'll be cowards. If we attack, we'll have dead children in the papers. They go to Cairo as civilians, to mislead the press. There, they will join the train. Get to the scene and await orders. You'll need to show what's special about your "special" drive. Very well. "And the American counselor?" -Rules that. And the Republic Did you see that? Do you think she'll say yes? Cazeneuve said to come in civilian, it was in my pocket. We were going to dinner. Cecile and I, tonight. But seriously, do you think she's going to say yes or no? "We've been together for five years. -Lorca. I'm not afraid she'll say no. I'm worried about... Lorca. Being your friend is not my job. Hey, look at this. I did it with an old coat of my mother. With a suspender, make a point here... Guns are the alibi. Georges' passion is sewing. It matches your age, you see? "Do you have any problems at my age?" -Not even a little. Are you going to do what with your toys when you're in an office? Offer to your wife. You know I do not have one. If I get married, you'll be the godmother. Hey, Georges! What is it? To be beautiful to you. Was that on the list? A dryer? "Have you ever been to Africa?" "Yes, when I signed up." And how is it there? And hot. No, I mean, what is Djibouti like? Its too hot. -Captain. -Good Morning. I just got word on the situation. The equipment will then do not worry. See, the problem is the airplane is full. As well? The passengers boarded and we have no spare seats. Listen well, scoundrel, if you do not want your legs broken, put us on that plane, understand? Captain! Captain... I come as a volunteer. Volunteer? Who are you? Why are you here? I'm their teacher. Voluntary for negotiations. Stay with the parents at the base. I already have too many problems here. Parents do not need me. But the children, yes. They are alone. I can help! Listen, miss. No one approaches the bus. I need you to leave. Miss, I need you to leave. Miss, come back! Damn it. Come back! Captain. General. What is it? "The children's teacher, General. -Good job. We have 22 hostages now. It's Auntie Jane! He's here to get us. Stop right now! Come back right away! I'm the children's teacher. I am want to see them. I'm American, not French. You are American? We do not need you here, Professor. Are the kids OK. Now come back. They are fine for now, but soon they will not be. You will need help with them. Your driver left. I can help. If the French want to save the children, they'll be fine. I saw them planning. I swear you'll need me. So tell me, what are you doing? They brought the Armed Forces. Children. Everything will be fine. I'm here, right? So, who is hungry? Who wants to pee? I'll see what we have for today. -Philip Shafer. - Captain Gerval. "Are you the military adviser?" -Relax. I'm just an observer. -Do you speak French? "Three services in Indochina. In Vietnam, you mean? Well, do you speak English? I understand. But talk... I'll teach you. Pierre! Let's take off. Damn, sure we're in France? It looks like Nanterre. Sir? Sir. Excuse. Is your holster for real? I mean, is it like Clint Eastwood? I can see? -I have one too. That's why they chose Georges. To keep us informed about the latest fashion. I thought I had only one criterion to join the unit. Do not worry about my sight, boys. Thank you. We were all chosen for the same reason. -The question is, "Why do we accept?" - For my hair. They said I do not need to cut. Youth is beautiful. And you, why? I had no choice. They were going to kick me out. Do you see Georges? He wanted to blow up a tank using a remote control car. -It was a mistake of nothing. -"You're welcome"? You blew up the Hyères ammunition department! Only half the department. Put a grenade under a tank, Georges! All right, give me some time! Why did you accept it, Lieutenant? We studied together in Chaumont. Careful, boy, the lieutenant enlisted for believing. What about Larrain? Because he is the best. Bernardo? Bernardo, what happened? Let me see. I did nothing. I asked if we were going to school. "All right, Bernardo. Right. We need to take care of this. "Do not worry, I'll take care of it. -It's all right. "Are you cold?" -I'm not well. -Try to rest. -Right. It's going to be okay, right? What do you want, teacher? Did you hit him? He's hurt. You need medicine or you will get infected. -Let him go. "God willing, he'll be fine. But he is not well! One will not make any difference. Maybe I'll kill him now. Easier. Good, this would irritate the Armed Forces even more. Go back inside, Professor. Damn it. Poor children. So you guys are cavalry? I was promised the elite of the Military Force. I do not think so. Which one of you is Captain Gerval? It's me, General. Firmin, show the lodge. Is your father Colonel Gerval of the 11th Shock Troop? - How's he doing? - He died last year. So, you're the CIA's cowboy. Do not be surprised, boy. You do not look like a diplomat. Come with me. He's right. Who are the clowns? -I have to go. -Because? Bored already? Recognition. I need to find a good place. Calm down, you will not be able to see anything now. If things get hot, we'll need men in position. Better to prevent. Anyway, we have no orders from Paris. The kids are sleeping. Nothing will happen. Good... "Tell me about the terrorists." -Rahmani. We have four heavily armed individuals. They are from a rebel group. They ask Djibouti to return to Somalia. -No ultimatum? -A message. Tomorrow, at dusk, the children will be executed. -We have movement. -What the hell? Where is this idiot going? Shafer, did you know Somalia let them come and go? Of course I know. They are fighting for the same cause. Call for Paris! Gerval, Make your acknowledgment, but keep your distance. Clear. Rahmani, go with him. Can you lend me? Careful, I like mine... Jacket. Did you see that my optical viewfinder oscillates? Really? "Damn, it's condensed. Can you solve this? One minute. I knew it would do. Can our equipment handle this heat? The equipment is not the problem. We will be the problem. Why does not this work? Pierre? What do you think, really? How big are their knives? -20 cm? -22. Standard bayonets. They are not precision shot equipment. It's the Armed Forces, is not it? It's definitely not the same deal. They are a bunch of mourners. He's really weird. You know the hammer game? They are two players. Each one picks up a nail and hammers it a bit on a table. You tie a cloth on your forehead. One at a time, the first to preach, wins. Of course it's with the forehead. It's his favorite pastime. "Where's Jean-Luc?" -Making friends. Larrain! Lorca, get your rifle. You're coming with us. I'll do the recon. Stand on the rooftops. Give us coverage. How old were you the last time you took such a bus? I think about 12 at the most. But you do not mind, do you? He does not look like he has children. Do you know what people call you? "The machine". I know it's the best, but... -Make an effort. "You do not know anything, Lorca. All you do is talk too much. You're a good shot, but you'd better keep quiet. That's exactly what I said. You do not give a damn. You do not care about these kids. It's not our job. "Not our job"? Let psychiatrists and politicians take care of the victims. But only if you do your job well. Hit your target. This is your problem. Just it. I have three sons. If you tell anyone, I'll kill you. Damn it. We have nowhere to hide. We are very close! Gerval! Gerval! Damn it. What he is doing? Is he trying to stop this now? Morad, all right. They will help us. You wanna hold my skirt? I'm just going on the other side of the bus, okay? Can I have some privacy? -Mrs? Mrs? -Yes. Not! It was a snake! I am fine. I'm going. I hate snakes. Damn it. Looks like we have company. That! Who switched on the lights? Erase it now! -Who are you? -Military force! From Paris. The shooters of the capital. We know that you are afraid of the dark. We're on the same side, people. I think not. Old fags of your type... You think you're too smart to talk like that. Really? Not! Back off, soldier! -Be careful, I'm Lieutenant! -Really? And where is your uniform? We're dressed as civilians. I may be sissy, but I'm not old. It seems that Campère does not like the Armed Forces. What happened? "They spoke about his age. -Clear. -What the hell was that? "Captain, watch your tone." What the hell was that, General? Local diplomacy. If they turn the lights on, so do we. I could have been killed. Thank you. So how was your ride? The land is flat. I found a place, but not ideal. Where is your friend? The CIA hippie. Come with me. Firmin, find Shafer, even if he's in the bathroom. So, what's your deal? - Simultaneous shot. -What? Five synchronized rifles. One shot. All fall at the same time, without retaliation. -Angry. "Is that even possible?" When we are well trained, yes. Have you tried it out of training? -Afirmative, General. -AND? -During a mission. -It worked? "Not perfectly." -Good. It calms me down. What do you think? I'd like to see that. What if the Somalis attacked? We'll need your help. With the kids in the middle, it would be a massacre. You got a better idea, General? Could you give us a minute, Shafer? Do you believe in your bullshit? For sure. That's why my unit was created. To intervene without resulting in deaths. On our side, at least. Why are you here in Somalia, Professor? It's a long story and I do not share it with strangers. You like the French. I do not care about the French. White children. Any color. You know, This is no place for a cool girl like you. You should find a good husband and have children. Maybe I have a good husband, Maybe they died in a plane crash. Or maybe they're home, waiting for me. Maybe I'm someone who likes to live in places like this. Or maybe all this is a lie. Today, My life is with these children here. And I will do everything to protect them. I was a teacher too. Long ago. And I care about kids too. The children of my country. So they can be free one day. Want some Khat? You're wasting our time. You'd better kill her now. Morad... Always in a hurry. Let's get rid of her when we evacuate the hostages in Somalia. You can take care of her if that's so important to you. I'm warning you, you're wasting our time. You already shot to kill? I thought fanatics and hostages were worth the same. "Enlist for life," was not that our motto? We are not here to know who is right or wrong. They kidnapped children. So do not question yourself. You did not answer my question. Twice. I killed two men. It still makes me sleepy. Not every night, but... It is. You can accept or leave. Or do like Larrain. Think they are just targets. But you would become a great bastard. Pierre, please. All right, boys. We will do this: We'll start at 5 o'clock sharp. The land... French, Somalis and the bus. This will be our firing position. Positions: Cazeneuve, Larrain, Campère, Lorca and myself. BUS SHOOTING POSITION FRENCH FRONTIER Captain, Paris on the phone. For now, wait in position. Attack if there is only one terrorist on the bus. We can not risk hurting a child. I do not understand the order. There are four terrorists watching over the hostages. It can happen one exit, but three at the same time is difficult. The children can be taken away, and we will never see them again. I'll repeat: Diplomacy is the best solution. What? They are right in front of us! 20 children are in danger and are thinking about diplomacy? Stop it, Gerval. "Negotiate..." "Calm down. Can I talk, ma'am? I even noticed suspicious moves. You're starting to piss me off! If I wanted to argue, I would play bridge! They are orders. No further. Damn it. It's hot. You did not see anything yet. We should have brought the talc. For Lorca? In position. Okay, let's see how it goes. Larrain, the orange one is yours. Campère, the mustache is yours. Pierre, stay with Bob Marley. Lorca, you take care of the leader. I'll take care of the cover. Starting. One, done. Two, done. Three, ready. Do not. Again. One, done. Two, done. Three, ready. Four, ready. Wasp for Queen. Queen here, exchange. Four targets. Requesting permission to shoot, exchange. The firing order did not change. I turn it off. -André. -Yes? What are we waiting for? What is the order, exactly? Make yourself comfortable. For now, the order is only to shoot if there is a target on the bus. -What? -Are you serious? -Why are we in five? -I said "for now." Let the diplomats work. Are we going to wait for Giscard to send us candy? We expect orders. We could have waited at the hotel pool. Do not tell me that. In position, boys! Starting. Damn it. They're getting in and out of the bus all the time. Interesting. That's exactly what Cazeneuve was saying about his fiancee. Do not listen to him. It was not meant to be in the sun. Starting. Have you talked about my fiancee? One, done. Two, done. Do not. These children need to stop moving. Again. Queen for Vespa. Wasp in the listening. They are taking supplies to the bus. You can rest. Understood. Exchange. Rest, boys. Larrain, keep watching. -Captain. -Yes? Northeast, Captain. Wasp for Queen. In listening, exchange. Enough activity on the Somali side. Can it be more accurate? At least one assault unit. And two MG42. Some 60 armed officers are enough for a small border, right? Paris is not aware of any suspicious activity. Well, if Paris is saying... Understood, exchange. Campère... Excuse me. -Not this one. -What? It's just the heat. "I have a delicate sphincter. -Damn it. What the hell, Georges. Fast! I could drop some kids. Would be easier. Do not worry about what's easy for me. So tell me who we can negotiate with. Negotiate? We have nothing to negotiate. Is that what you did in Algeria? Negotiate? Let him take the wounded child. Shut up, teacher! Do you have a wounded child? -Stop the girl! -Put the gun down. Release the girl! Put it inside! -Put the gun down. "Do not make me shoot!" -Put the gun down. -Skirt! Captain, we have a problem. In position. Immediately! Wasp for Queen. -Rain here. "Rahmani has a girl. They are with them in sight. - Calm down. -Please! -Please! -Put the gun down! Pierre, I see three. Me too. On the other side. Ahead. The girl is in the way. - Can they attack? -Negative. Too risky, too much movement. "Lower your weapon, calm down. -Please! -Put the gun down. - Let them go! Show charity. Shut up! Do not let him go, Barkad. -Do not worry. - Get down. -I know what to do. -Put the gun down! What are you waiting for? Shoot him or he'll die! Shut up. "Camp?" -In sight. -Cazeneuve? -The teacher is very close. Only if it's clean. Do not take another step. - Put your gun down. -Children! Lie down in the armchairs and close your eyes, now! Shut up! Do not take another step. Put the gun down. I'm not here to show charity, Professor. André? André, what shall we do? Put your weapons down. "They killed an officer ..." "Lower your weapons!" Is not that enough, Lorca? Want what? Carnage? We are here to save the children, not to be heroes. We will intervene, but on our terms. Understood? We could have saved him. We could also have lost both, it could have been a massacre. It could have been worse. I do not want to be responsible for the death of a child. Does not an officer mean anything? It could have been me or you. He had nothing to do. The child followed him. Shut up, Lorca. He could have put the girl along with the others. That's what happens when you care too much. The boy you hurt. It is getting worse. Let me go get medicine for him. You never give up. You do not even know. Good to see you. Everything is ready? The bus arrives soon. We will evacuate at dusk. It's safer that way. Go. Let me take you with me. Please. André. There are many of them. It seems so. A beer would go well now. Georges. What? Shut up please. Rest, boys. Lorca, come with me. Pierre, take charge. They are not doing anything. Five shooters. "No, Captain. Only five. "Write to Rahmani's family." Officials can... "General, about Rahmani ..." "Forget it, Captain. You could not do anything, I was wrong. Find water and food for Captain's men. Lorca, help him. My men will not last long, General. We need to make a decision. - Get back. -As? Join your men. If Paris had orders, we would have already done it. Sampieri was clear. A terrorist on the bus. I dont understand. You're only here to keep the American quiet, and he's not stupid. While we found someone to pay for it. They want their country. No one is for sale. Did you see what they did to Rahmani? Children are the next, you know that. "How much longer will you take it?" "Three or four hours, no more. Very well. When we shoot, they will not react, they will not know what hit them. Children can come on foot. We'll cover them. "Is that your plan?" -Yes. Well, if Paris is victorious, I want to be on the list. A sniper is missing. -What's it? - "Three services in Vietnam". Do you know how to shoot? Officially... Officially, I'm not even here. Too easy. You want me to do that? Soak your hands too. No one will know. "I need someone on the bus." -As well? "If the teacher-" "You want to talk?" After they killed the officer, they are waiting for the Armed Forces. I think they want to calm down. -Take it. -Thanks. -Best? -Yes, thank you. Besides the rifles, have you seen any other weapons? Yes, the boss has a gun. Right. And explosives? They have one or two grenades each. They are tired, almost without khat, and beginning to get aggressive. They wait for dusk to take the children to Somalia. All right, I'll call Paris. We have to act fast. The children will not be able to bear much. Who the hell are you anyway? We are here to help you. You're going out with all the kids, two at a time. What? Evacuate children two at a time? Yes. The French are usually arrogant and not suicidal. We have two units of the Armed Forces. It will be enough. But we need children to stay calm. They can not enter into our field of vision. They are between six and twelve, Captain. It's hot, and they've been hostages for over 24 hours. I can not do miracles. If they're stoned, maybe. This can be done. Ms. Come here. We need a sleeping pill. Very sleepy. We will return to the position, General. We communicate on the radio. Thanks. I'm hungry. I'm thirsty. Georges... One of my neighbors went to a nursing home. The place is cool. want to meet? Stop this. Why would I leave my mother's house? My things are there, I do not pay rent. And she's great. If I leave, what will she do? And what am I going to do? Lieutenant, come look at this. Northeast, in the jeep in the background. What the hell is this? Teacher, you're back! Good for you. I say what I do, and I do what I say. All right, everyone gets a bottle. It's very, very hot. And when it's hot, you need to drink plenty of water. I've never eaten sardines as good as these. Sardine? A "thank you" would be good. Or a smile. Something like. On here. In the jeep. Damn it. I've watched them for half an hour. He is not in charge, but gives many orders. Shafer. Go eat something. Tell others to be ready. In the jeep, northeast. Damn it. Do you know him? -Do you know? "No, they were not sure. Who are? GRU? KGB? KGB, probably. I would not do it if I were you. If you call Paris, you will have a withdrawal order. André... I know how to shoot, but... This simultaneous business... I'm not trained for that. -It's simple. -IS? We count to three. As? Every shooter has his number. You will be the five. You choose a target. If it's clean, say, "Five, ready." I am the last. If my target is clean, I say "Zero." We count up to three in our heads and we fired. It is? Do you count to three? Why "zero" and not "fire"? "Fire" is very stressful. Boys, in position. Shafer, to my left. Larrain, you take care of the giant. Shafer, you take care of orange. Get ready. Start. One, done. Two, done. Three, ready. Not... Do not. Again. One, done. Dad? Wasp for Queen. In listening, exchange. They are preparing to evacuate the children. One of them got off the bus. We must act. Negative, Vespa. Only a terrorist on the bus. I'll be clear, General. It's dusk, we're tired. If they take the kids, we'll never see them again. -You see? -Negative, Vespa. The Somalis were clear, any attempt will be an act of war. Rest. Larrain. Right. We have no orders from the Elysee Palace. Children will be evacuated soon. Or we quit now. and let's go home, or save these children. Are you going to risk it? The question is simple. So, what do you want to do, Captain? Campère, you decide. Understand that without orders, the risk is great. For all. -Vespa to Queen. -Rain on the listener. Get ready. Put your units on alert. What did he say? That we can follow. He will not act without orders. You think he's going? Starting. One, done. Two, done. Three, ready. Four... Ready. Five... Ready. Zero. André, what do we do? We waited. They do not know where we are. They heard only shots, nothing more. Wake up. Wake up! Wake up, come on. Come on, wake up! Come on, wake up. Wake up, now! Wake up! -What happened? What did you do? -Please! I beg! Come on, wake up! Fast! Wake up fast! Damn it! Get down! Get down! I think they know where we are now! Captain! What are the Armed Forces waiting for? We die? Not! Let's show you how! Larrain! Just shoot the ones with weapons! To charge! To charge! Captain! Captain! We have to go! Georges! Pierre! Follow him! We cover! Shafer, go! I'll be back! Listen, I know our diplomats have promise of neutrality, but I am here. And I guarantee that if you do not make a quick decision, there shall be no surviving children or officers. Yes, I'll wait. Put the gun down! "Are you alone?" -Not. "Are they in three?" -Will be all right. Louise, Louise! Down here, fast! Hide in the back! Get down! On the floor, on the floor! To charge! Georges! It's ok? - I got shot in the foot! "On the foot?" But how did you get shot in the foot? I do not know, asshole! Grenade! -I do not see anything! "Not them either!" The cavalry! Damn it! Let's go! C'mon C'mon! Lowered, calmly. - Stay down. -Fast fast! -Let's go! -C'mon C'mon! Let's go. Quick, come on. Let's go. Come on! Protect the children! Come in! Come in! Can go! Let's go! Louise! Louise! Louise? It's gonna be okay. It's all right. It's gonna be okay. Sirs, honestly, it was a success. A success? You are kidding? You call it a success? Is that what you'll tell her parents? And the enemies? Did you see them? You think we're butchers? Where were you, General? We were waiting for orders. Imagine what would have happened if we started firing. It would not be a girl we'd put in a coffin. They would all be in the class. THE REFORES AND THEIR FAMILIES NEVER WERE OFFICIALLY RECOGNIZED AS "VICTIMS OF TERRORISM" AND EVEN LIVE WITH THE TRAUMAS CAUSED BY THESE EVENTS. Thank you, Captain. THREE MONTHS LATER, UNITY RECEIVED THE NAME OF GIGN. IN THE LAST 40 YEARS, THEY RELEASED MORE THAN 600 REFORES AND LOST 11 MEMBERS FULFILLING YOUR DUTY. Thanks. Thank you. Thanks. This ring is ugly. But you will be a good husband. A YEAR AFTER, DJIBOUTI BECAME AN INDEPENDENT STATE. HISTORY BASED ON REAL FACTS THE FACTS MAY HAVE BEEN CHANGED FOR FICTIONAL PURPOSES.
