AN OCEAN BLUE Give it to me! -No! Give it, give it! -No way. Come on, give it! No! Churros! Crispy Churros with Dulce de leche! -Can I try? -No. Dad, why is the sea blue? The water isn't any color. It looks blue because it's reflecting the sky and it's deep. So it's not blue? No, it doesn't have any color. We just see it in different colors. For instance, here it's blue, but it can be green or greyish too. It depends on where you are. But I like it being blue. Then it's blue. Come on, go into the water! Come on, let's go! -Ceci, try to get this one. -No, no, go, go. This one, the cube. Come on! No, this way! A little more. No, your way. -Right there! No. -No, your way. Yes, yes, yes. Check your height. -Yeah, there. -Yes, yes, yes. No! This game's such a scam. Let's play something else. -This one's a drag. -Yeah, definitely. -Which one? -That one. What is it? I got a job offer in the new Markevich clinic. It's ready. They're organizing the staff. And when did they tell you? A few days ago. Why? I could keep my private practice. I'd do follow-ups with the patients. Why didn't you tell me? What do you want to do? I was organizing the trip, Ricardo. It slipped my mind. I don't know. I haven't answered them yet, but it's a good opportunity. I don't know, Lola. A second job means more time. I have to focus on the projects that are backed up. How are we gonna do with the kids? I don't want them hanging out with the maid all day. This is not the time. We'll talk about it when we get back. -No, no, no! -Evil firefighters. -Back in the game! -I got killed! Wait, no. -Mom, tell her to lend it to me. -Stop it and share. I'm older. Why should she get to use my stuff? It's embarrasing. Stop arguing and start cleaning up! Look at this. Come on! Girls, how are you so messy? -It's Belén. -Not true. Stop bickering! -Ricardo, I'm all dirty. -Even better. The kids are all over the place. They left everything a mess. Relax, Lola. We're on vacation. That's what you say now. But in bed, you're the first to complain. Where are the kids? Dad, can you buy me a board? Really? Why? Did you see one on the beach? Yeah, one of those that you can lay down on in the waves. No! You'll go too far and won't get out. But we know how to swim. Yeah, but you have to be careful with the ocean. Slow down, Santi! And the kids? Did you leave them in the water? Kids, come back. Don't go out so far! Come on, Santi. Look at this one. It's huge. Come back! Come back! Did you see how it barked at them? It's not an attack. They're friends of fishermen. They scare the sea-wolves back into the water. -So they don't still the fish. -Makes sense. One more. Take another one. Let go. It smells awful. I can't stand it, Dad. Can we go? We just got here. Cover your nose and breathe through your mouth. -Look at this one. -Look at the sea wolves. Yes. Mom, look. The sea wolves are so beautiful! They're posing! -Can I use the camera? -OK, but hang it on your neck. They have names and numbers. They come to the water to fish. -Mom. -What is it? -I don't feel well. -Do you feel like throwing up? Let's go find a bathroom. Ricardo. Look! That sea lion's swimming. Look, that one grabbed something. Mommy? Ceci! What happened? Where's Lola? -I don't know where she is. -You threw up. Disgusting! Alright, calm down, she'll be back. I bet you swallowed ocean water. -You OK? -Maybe she went to get some medicine. Yeah. Calm down, she'll be back. Can we go to the hotel? -Yeah, as soon as your mom gets here. -Okay. Are you mad at me? No, Ceci. Why would you say that? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. -I promise it won't happen again. -OK. Now get some rest. Help! No, no, no! Careful. Get up! Hug! Dog pile! Why did you leave? I don't know. -Do you like my sea lion? -Yeah, I really like it. -Careful, Ale! -Stop bothering. -The fountain's so pretty. Isn't it? -Yeah. Belu, let me see. Good job. -I made a ton. -I didn't make any this time. What if I throw her in? No, Dad, don't. No, Dad. Should I throw her in? Should I? Do you still love me? Lola. Put me down. We're in public. Get Dad! No. Whoever tickles me goes into the water. Ceci, it's a lot! Bubbles, bubbles. Go and see how Belén's sleeping. She's hugging her sea lion. I can't now. I want to finish this. Tomorrow when we go, be sure the kids have everything, and Ale has his inhaler. I'll go down early to pay at the front desk. OK. Remember how she fell in love with that rabbit that shit all over the house? What's going on? Why did you buy Ale the board? You know I didn't agree to that. Because he's a teenager. You keep treating him like a little kid. Yeah, but that's not the only reason. You know that Santi copies him. They don't follow rules. They play and don't see the danger. -That's how accidents happen. -See how you always exaggerate? I'm not gonna send them into the water alone. First I'll teach them how to use it. And you know I could never hurt our kids. Ricardo, don't start. And don't you ever press me in front of the kids again. What are you talking about? You know what I'm talking about. Who wants some? No! We've been here before. It must be the other way. No, Lola, we're somewhere new. Can't you tell, the sea's over there? But there must be people that way. Why don't we stop and ask? Come on, Ricardo. Stop and ask, if you don't know where to go. Lola, I know where I'm going. But we've been circling for three hours. We'll get there so late. Mom, Belén brought a ton of bugs. She's making a mess. -They're not bugs. They're snails. -You're such a snitch. Why'd you bring them? I'll have to clean up. I let her bring them. It's no big deal. She'll clean up and put them away. Right, honey? Your clothes are filthy. Put them here. Close it so the smell doesn't get out. -I can't stand the smell! -Don't throw up here. Come on, Ricardo. Let's stop and ask for directions. Who are you gonna ask? There's nobody out here, Lola! I don't know. I'll knock on a door and ask! More salad, anyone? This one has lemon. This one, vinegar. -I want the lemon one. -I want juice. -Juice? OK, sweetie. -Me too. -I'll pour it. -OK, please do. -Me too. -Do you like the food? Is it good? Yeah. It's good. How's the new house? Must be quiet here. Isn't it? Yeah, it really is. -It's a different pace. -Mine has less. Pour some more. It worked out with our jobs. We enjoy the beach. Different, but it's beautiful. And people is very nice. -They always do that? -Always. It's a beautiful house. Yeah, really beautiful. Thank you. There's a lot of love in this house. And we painted the living room ourselves. Really? -Hard to believe, but yes. -Are you serious? Yes. We wanted to. -It took forever. -Yeah, forever. It's true. -But it was fun. -Nice though. Beach man and painter. Really surprising, Julio. Your life has changed. -Can we play Simon later? -Sure. -I'll go first. -Then me. -I'll go third. -What's Simon? -It's a memory game. -With lights and sound. You memorize a pattern of lights, and then make it. She's the family champion. -She's the family champion. -No way! I am. I'm the champion. -No. I am. -Ceci is. -You're so cocky. -I always win. -Cocky. -I'm not cocky. I'm the best. -It's true. It's Ceci. -You remind me of someone. Of mom. She's the smartest. Ricardo, they got you. We're all going to play anyway. You won't be the champion, and you either. I will! -Come on. It's my turn now. -No. -Hello. -Hi, guys. -What?! -Yay! It's my turn. I got it right. It's not working. -You're the worst. -You broke it. That's what happens. Construction's profitable, for now. The problem is our country's economy. You never know. True. In our company, they're worried too. It makes sense. How are you doing? Still working at the hospital? You know, I admire you. You have a lot of energy and get around. Something that stuck in my mind is I've always seen you helping people. And seeing you with the kids is impressive too. Now because we're on vacation but it's not simple. I'm always at the hospital. Ricardo is busy too. But I am here for the kids. They send me everywhere to buy this or that. But it's not just about material things. It's about being home, cooking, cleaning... But we always work that out, Lola. Because when you get home, it's all done. I say I want another job and the world's ending. Why do you say that? It's not true. Go, go, go. That's it! That's it! -It's my turn. -I'm next. Now it's Santi's turn. Look! Here. Careful. Come on! -Where is it? -Over here. Why are the beds separated? They don't have double beds for everyone. Why don't we push them together? -Yeah, lets! -Let's do it. Leave everything just like it is. Stop it! Stop it! -Stop it! -You stop. Let me help you. I drove it all in one shot. Just you? No rest? But Lola drives really well. But he doesn't want me to drive. No, it's not that. I get nervous when she drives. Oh, Ricardo, still? When he was younger too. He'd never let you. -I got it from my old man. -You're getting old. -Yes, fussy too. -Slow down! They're so lovely! -I want a white one. -I want a black one. White. Black. That's the last one. Enough. Dad, can I have some mate? Sure. Here. Ricardo. We can't keep this up, Ricardo. It makes no sense. What makes no sense? Us. This. This trip. What are you saying? Mom! Ale! -Where's your inhaler? -What happened? Slow. Calm down. It's almost over. Look at me. That's it. Excellent. -Do you want some water? -Bring him some. Good. Now you're better. That's it. Are you OK? Go back to bed. Go. Why are you doing this, Lola? I can't imagine another man playing with my kids. It's not gonna happen. You're thinking nonsense. And they're our kids. You want me to quit my job, stay home with the kids? I'll do it. Tell me what to do, and I'll do it. It's over. Bet you can't do this. Bet I can, and that I can do it better. Look. But you can't do it like this. They're amazing. I'll run into you. Careful. I'd get you for that. No! I'll beat you. ...20, 21, 22, 23, ...24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30. Ready or not, here I come! Gra? Graciela! Graciela? Graciela? Graciela? -What's wrong? -I don't know. Graciela? Can you hear me? Go and call your dad. What happened? -What happened?! -I don't know. I'll take it from here? Wait. -Take over. -One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four, five! Come on, Graciela. Fuck. I don't know what happened. Does she take any medicine? Go get the car. Kids, go inside. Everybody in the house. Inside, let's go! They're coming to get her in two hours. I'd say make sure you say bye, but don't be here when they come. Ricardo and I will handle that. Keep the death certificate, they'll ask for it. You don't have to do anything. They'll handle everything. Irene and your mom will be here in the morning. We'll stay with you, if you want. If not, we'll leave, but we want to stay with you. I'm so sorry, Julio. She really died? Mommy. Dad, come here. -Dad, there's a sea lion. -What? Where? There, that's a sea lion! What happened? -Are you OK? -Yes. Honey, sit down. You can't ride like that.
