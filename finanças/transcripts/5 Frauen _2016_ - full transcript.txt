5 WOMEN That's Leo. You're all looking great! Where's Steffi? - Yeah, where is she? - Oh, she'll be here soon. Have fun on the boat. Don't drown. See you in three days. See you soon. Finally! It's so great to have you here. - You managed to find a babysitter? - Could we not talk about kids for once? Or men, for that matter? At least one of us is never going to grow up. That really has nothing to do with being grown up. What? To do what you feel like doing. Are you crazy? What is it? Let's have a welcome drink. Just a second. Through there. Not through there. There. - Are you nuts? - You'll be OK! You do look really well. - Absolutely. - Thanks. I'm really well. I started painting again. - Show us. - I will. Later. What was up with you? There was a lizard in the shower. It shed its tail. I really thought there was somebody with you. - So did I. - He sure did have a tiny tail. - Yeah, a thing like this. - Like a crocodile. To us. - Doesn't look like Steffi's gonna show up. - But why? - John was here. Because of Nora. Nora and John. What? Love is three quarters curiosity. God no! I don't want something like this to ruin our weekend. Do you know where Steffi is? No. Did you really sleep with John? Just now? When I was at your door? - That's only my and John's business, right? - And Steffi? Steffi doesn't give a shit about John. I was so looking forward to this weekend. To see all of you again. Now you spoil it “cause you need a shag? These things happen when you're not frigid. I see. Shit. Marie, sorry! I didn't mean that. I'm really sorry. That was stupid of me. I'll talk it over with Steffi. The last thing I wanted to do is ruin the weekend for you and the others. I don't know what's going on with me. I'm sorry. I didn't want to say that. See you in a bit. I'll be with you soon. How about a magic mushroom for you, Leo? Maybe I'll understand your language then. Look These are not for you. Someday I'd like to have a house, too. With Paul? He loves you. You can tell. I just don't know if I can handle so much happiness. Are you going to move in together? No, it'd kill the sex life. Even the bacteria in the washing machine would mix. Which bacteria? From the underwear. It's true! Everything becomes one. Until the day you even lose your own taste. True. That's when true happiness sets in. You sound like my mum talking about '68. It wasn't all wrong, after all. One man isn't enough for you either. I'm with Micha, and it'll stay like that. Sure, it'll stay like that. For ever and ever. Open your eyes at the count of three, okay? Ready? One, two, three. Is this recent? I just finished them yesterday. So much has happened. - They're fabulous. - Really? Thank you. You know... This is to finish up with everything. I wanted to thank you all. I mean, thanks for being here. Well, thanks for having us. And thanks for being there for me over these last years. It wasn't... an easy time. But I've gotten through it. And that's also because of you. When I couldn't get to sleep at night sometimes... and when I didn't know how to get through it, I thought of you. And our holiday in Italy. When we were all in the car. Listening to loud music... Our whole lives in front of us, and we just went for it. And wasted it. And then I remembered... what I have to fight and live for. Thank you. To our friendship. To us To you. Can I have some water? What do you mean, seasoned? That was just a phase. People who talk about food non-stop while eating. I have nothing here. But we can kill a chicken. It's beautiful. An octopus. Is it also coming towards you? I've never seen someone as beautiful as you. You're a fairy. A fairy? What was that? I'm going to lie down. Is everything okay? I'm not feeling well. I'm going to... lie down. Fuck off, lizard! I'm taking a piss here. Piss off, will you! Leave me alone! Everything will be alright. Is anybody there? Help! You pig! He looks like a surfer. He wasn't armed. Maybe he was just looking for a place to sleep. Is he really dead? Yes. He looked so different. Please go. We'll come in a moment. We should call the police now, or it'll just get worse. Will they question us? Of course. We'll all have to make a statement. But we can't give a statement on drugs. I mean, won't that automatically make us culpable? Police Department Saint-Pons-de-Thomi?res. Come on, Marie! Try to remember! I need to know if he threatened you. - He wasn't armed. - Did he threaten you? Do you know how it is when a stranger who looks like the devil is suddenly standing in front of you? - Let's all tell the police that. - Shut up with your bullshit for once! How long does this stuff last? It's always different. Do you have a Valium? I can't really handle killing on mushrooms. But we do, or what? We really need to think about what we're going to say. It'll be hard to prove who of us killed him. Somehow Marie creates this shit. What? She should've gone into therapy. Instead of painting pictures. Has anything like that ever happened to you? If you've been made a victim once, it's not easy to avoid being one again and again. Being a victim changes people. It's an invitation for others to turn you into a victim. Some people can sense victims. In ER, I always see the same battered men and women. It pisses me off! Now I'm a victim. You? We killed the man. I put ten years into this clinic. And now this had to happen. It's too late now, anyway. I'll go out and talk to them. Why is she taking so long? What did you tell them? I changed my mind. I told them... that we made a mistake. That we were in the screening room... And the wind, the weather... That nothing happened? - It was self-defence. Why lie? - Self-defence? Don't be naive. It was four against one. They still celebrate the German Armed Forces“ defeat out here. All you need is a socialist provincial public prosecutor who doesn't like Germans. You're the lawyer here! Anna's probably right. Hard to say how it'd turn out. We're still under the influence. We're all involved. - Is it murder? - Putative self-defence. Unless we get his fingerprints onto a weapon and say he threatened us. How much jail time would you have to do then? - None, probably. - See? - None of us has a criminal record. - But how will it come across in Germany? How will the press handle this? "German women high on drugs kill man". It didn't happen because we were high! Yes, it did, Ginette. And there are patients and investors who don't want senior doctors jumping around high on mushrooms, and operating on them while having flashbacks. - Oh, really? - Yeah, really. I think you're right. It's my fault. Marie, there's no use in saying that. I overheard you and Anna earlier. You think I'm still a victim and I'm dragging you into this. That's not important now. What's important is how we get rid of him. It is important, Anna. It's important to me. I didn't mean to override you all earlier. But someone has to take the reins. Oh, and who is that? And now? We let him disappear. And we leave it for what it is. A terrible accident. But without any legal or other consequences for any of us. We can't change the fact that he's dead. Can we? Well, aren't you a merry bunch! What the hell did you take? - Am I sleeping in my room? - I'll bring you up there in a moment. I still have my stuff in the car. Have a nice day, sweetheart. Coffee? It's so nice to be here again. Who is he? - Who? - That man. Oh. Ask me an easier one. I brought you something. It's lovely. I almost didn't come. - I can't bear seeing Nora's face. - I know. You know... - What? - Nothing. I like you. Most of all. How do you know Steffi? From swimming, and doing sports. By the ocean? What are you doing here? Actually we are having an all-girls weekend. No men? Sounds dangerous. What's dangerous? Nothing. Our car got stuck in the mountains up there. I need a saw. Or an axe. - And then I'll leave. - What were you doing up there? I really just need a saw. The gardener locked up the tool shed. But I can drive you to your car. It's not that far. I don't want you to get stuck, too. Let's go. What's going on here? My brother disappeared last night. He's mute. We don't have your brother. Just fuck off now, will you? What's that supposed to mean? He's stretching out his feelers. We'll cut them off, then. - We need to bury him. - No way. - The dogs will dig him up. - Hang on. I found a swamp on my computer yesterday. Jesus, Steffi! Have you gone mad? Steffi, there was an accident here yesterday. - What? - An accident, for fuck's sake. What are you doing here again? I won't harm you. Can we start afresh, please? Let me explain. A wild boar ran out in front of our car. I killed it. When my brother and I wanted to drive off, a branch had got stuck under the car. We haven't managed to move since last night. My brother went to get help, but he disappeared. Then go back to your car and wait for him. He could sleep in the guest room until the garage opens on Monday. It's not a problem. Right, Marie? Of course not. We wanted to spend a weekend together. Once a year without any men, and now you drag him along with his wild boar and brother. I don't want to get involved in his shit. Are you out of your mind? He's a human being. And he needs help. Our all-girl weekend is ruined anyway. Stephanie's completely right. Follow me. - I'm Marie. - Marek. - Someone broke in last night. - Him? The man attacked Marie, and we came to help. Now he's dead. - Seriously? - It was an accident. Did you tell the police? Thanks to Ginette, we were high, and Marie had a bad flashback. And where is the body? In the cistern. And now? Better he stays here than roam around the grounds. This is the room. For a moment I was sure you know my brother. You're different... from the others here. You're... You're an artist. How do you know? I can see. You don't need to be afraid. It's just that we wanted to be alone here. I won't be any bother. Don't get me wrong... No, of course. See you later. I'll bring you some food and some fresh towels. Have you lost your mind? I did a chainsaw workshop. - Hi, mum. How are you? Mum's well. - Very Well. - We were at the swimming pool. - Where were you, sweetie? - Swimming, Swimming? I jumped from the 3-meter board and Maxi made a belly flop. I can't hear you so well. Mum, when do you come back... What if he notices? We'll have to distract him. How? By playing five-cards? Ginette's an actress. Me? - You've lost all your marbles now. - You gave us the mushrooms. This wouldn't have happened without them. Mushrooms generally make people peaceful. But not if you just throw them in a salad. I know Marek a little better. - I had sex with him this morning. - But why? There was no one else around. If it helps... I'll go see him this afternoon. No, damn it. I'll go. It's too dangerous. - And you might betray us. - What? We don't know the guy. He turns up here with some fairytale about his alleged brother disappearing... I looked into his eyes. He's not a bad person. He has a good heart. I wonder what's left of that when he finds out about his brother. Go to hell. - What's wrong with her? - She feels sorry for him. That won't get us anywhere. Steffi, you talk to him. We'll leave as soon as it gets dark. You wanna be alone? If this had been outside last night, it would've been wet. Someone lost it during the day. After it had rained. Maybe it was your brother. Maybe you just missed him. Maybe he went back to the car? No. He's around here. Your friends know where he is. I can sense it. So why don't they say anything? Because they're devious. Like snakes. Especially the tall one and her friend. Relax. They're just normal women. And what's a normal woman like? Well, I don't know that either. Usually these things resolve themselves. What are you doing here anyway? We travel around and surf. Endless summer... And in the winter? Morocco. And you? I'm studying monkeys. Seriously? Then you know that sex is a good way to channel aggression. Absolutely. This is not for me. I see. You wanna play five-cards? He found a photo in the garden. Now he thinks his brother is here. Girls... I'm leaving. Can't you take the corpse with you? - Please stay here. - I don't want anything to do with this. - You're making a huge mistake. - No, we're not. - I can't help you. - Yes, you can. By staying. I'm going back to Barcelona. Come with me. I can't leave the house alone. Or the others. They'll manage without you. Of course. It was my fault. It's you that wants to think so. Take care, darling. Everything's on fire The house is burning Because I set it ablaze It's gone up in smoke Soot and ashes And I alone pack my bags And then a huge swarm of birds flies over the meadow And asks who must burn here today And I say: Everyone! But take me along Your head will burn off, too Because I started a fire You think, she's not right in the head But that isn't true at all And then a huge swarm of birds flies over the meadow And asks who will have to die here today And I say: Everyone! But take me along... Have you known each other long? We met at a handicraft class for only kids with behavioural problems. Since then we've been meeting up. Every year, every summer. To see what's become of us. It's good to have good friends. People can be like medicine for each other. Is all of this yours? The house? No. It belongs to my parents. But they're in Paris most of the time. I feel most comfortable in the countryside. I feel most safe. With the dog, I mean. But not around people? Can you tell? You try. Do you think the dead guy really is his brother? Never. He's cunning and has crept in here like a virus. But it's still better if he's here. Shall we go? What about Marie? Ginette's with her. We have no other choice. Fuck! Let go! Let go! He's breathing. Those are reflexes. Gases inside him. Come on. What is it? I feel so alive, somehow. Can they locate us with the GPS? Shit! Press. Press down! Why won't he go under? It's no use. Damn it. Why is it so deep here? We can't leave him here like this. Do you have a cigarette, by any chance? Thanks. My brother was here, wasn't he? No, Marek. Good night. Thanks. We have to get rid of him somewhere else. I can't believe we're doing this. Shit! Shit! They won't be looking for us. Good evening. We want to go to Saint-Pons-de-Thomi?res. You're going the wrong way. You need to turn around and return to the Route Nationale. And take care. There are two men on the run. Who? Criminals who are hiding in the region. Don't give anyone a ride. Have a good night! Go, go, go! Come on. Let's go. Wherever we want to go. So all this will not have been for nothing. I'm going to see him, okay? Have fun. - I prefer to stay here. - Sleep well. Still awake? What are you doing? I don't know. So much has happened. I want this now. I like you a lot. Can you only have sex by raping someone? Is that it? Is that why you're here? You're insane. I'm not insane. I saw the lizard. The only thing I remembered was that tattoo. I painted it, too. Don't you remember you raped me six years ago? You must remember. I was in prison six years ago. Do you know why things are so strange around here? What happened the night before yesterday? Your brother's dead. He wasn't your brother, was he? Get down on your knees. It was you, right? Apologise. I'm sorry. ...if I caused you any pain. Leave. Now. I thought you wanted to sleep with him? What happened? He's the man from the lake. I recognised his tattoo. And then you just let him leave? Should I report him to the police? He lost his brother. - Does he know his brother was here? - Of course he does. But he understood. You should've seen his eyes. Now I'm not a victim anymore. He knows that his brother is dead? I told him. What if he comes back tomorrow with the police and some dogs? Or if he decides to blackmail you? He won't say anything. He's the one to blame... Marie, you can no longer prove he raped you! You didn't even want to report him at the time! And rape doesn't justify manslaughter! The corpse is still in the car! You've really lost your mind. He left this at the guesthouse. What the hell is this? What if he's one of the guys the police are looking for? You think Marie could have forced him on his knees if he was? What are we going to do now? It's Claus. Hi, sweetie. Hey, Anna. I couldn't reach you. We're,. on our way and will be at the house in an hour. Yes, okay. See you soon. They'll be here in an hour. There he is. What do you want? We found this here. I'm sorry. Don't come back. Anna! Let's have a drink. I can't go around the bends sober. Let's take off right now. - What happened here? - Some trouble. I'll tell you later. - And Marie? - Asleep. She's not feeling well. Have you. Shall we go? You look great. I missed the kids. I have a surprise for you. But let's spend one night at a hotel. Good news, everyone: The two bad guys have been caught. No more road blocks. Drive safely! Now enjoy the sunshine and the rest of this wonderful weekend!
