Our speaker today will be Ms Waris Dirie from Somalia [audience applause] I love my mother I love my family and I love Africa For Over three thousand years the family truly believes that a daughter who is not circumcised is not clean because what exists between our legs is unclean. So it must be removed and sealed up, as proof of viginity and virtue and in the wedding night the husband takes a blade or a knife and cuts it open before he forces himself into his bride An uncircumcised girl cannot marry consequently she is expelled from her village and put on the same level as a whore. This practice continues even though it is not written in the Koran. It is accepted that as a result of this mutilation, woman are sick, mentally and physically, for the rest of their lives, The same women who are the back bone of Africa I survived, but my two sisters didn't. Sofia bled to death after being mutilated and Armina died in child birth with the baby in her belly. How much stronger would our continent be if this senseless ritual were abolished. There is a proverb in my country, The last camel in line walks as quickly as the first What ever happens to least of us, has an effect on all of us. When I was a child, I said I did not want to be a woman why? when it is so painful nd so unhappy, but now that I am grown I am proud to be who I am but for the sake of all of us let us try and change what that means to be a woman 130 million girls and women worldwide suffer from the impact of circumcision. Aso in Europe and the USA immigrants continue this cruel tradition. Waris Dirie was the first woman to bring the practice of female genitital mutilation to world public attention. In 1977 she was appointed by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan to be the ambassador in the fight against this terrible ritual. Since then female genital mutilation is officially forbidden in many countries. Never the less six thousand girls are maimed daily.
