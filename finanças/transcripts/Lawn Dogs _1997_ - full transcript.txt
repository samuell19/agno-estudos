Devon: Once upon a time, in a far off land, Lived a girl and her mother and father. Their village was surrounded by a high wall. Outside the wall was the forest, home of Baba Yaga, the Witch. Baba Yaga had iron teeth that could bite through trees. His legs were like chicken legs, and he ate little girls for dinner. But inside the wall, the girl was safe. Stick 'em up, Injun. Try the Madison house first. Then the Langers. Skip the Cutcheners, they're in Rhode Island for the weekend. That's the Laughlins, the Cutcheners are in town. Don't forget to ring 3 or 4 times with the Neils in Birchgrove Court. - The wife's almost deaf. - And on the school board. Everyone will get a taste of the Stockards. Yum yum. Devon: These are ready. Woman: Billy, snack time! Don't lose the money you get. Everyone loves that smile, remember. Your photo will be in the papers. - If she sells the most bags. - Oh, she will. She's the perfect little saleswoman. Make a good impression, honey. We're still the new kids on the block. Off to work we go. Don't fiddle with your socks, they're just new. - Be careful on the roads. - Watch for cars sweetie, - look left and right. - Now get going. Whatever you do, don't go outside the gate, sweetheart. Daddy loves you. Devon Stockard, now there's a girl who is out to conquer the world. You want me to buy a bag of those cookies from you? You're not on my list. - Man: Can I help you? - Yeah. I finished your lawn, sir. - Already? - I did a good job. Short back and sides. Got all the weeds, sir. Sorry, you think I could use your bathroom facilities? Guess not. Can I give you some help, son? Oh, I can get it, thanks. Just tell me when. Just a minute. Ok. Nothing. Alright, try it again. Get in. Lots of lawns. Business must be good. - Well, I'm not complaining. - You live close by here? Not that close by. Me either. What you got in that cooler? Oh. Soda pop. Shit, I was hoping it was ice-cold beer. It's hotter than a cat's crotch today, isn't it? Yeah, and I stink. I need a shower. I used to mow lawns when I was a kid. After a while it gets to be there's nothing in the world but lawns. Green lawns. And the best damn thing about lawns is, they always grow back. Let's not be in here past 5:00 unless you clear it with me first. At the edge of a big, dark forest, lived a girl, and her mother and father. One day, her mother said: "Girl, I shall make you a batch of cookies, and you must go and sell them in the forest." Now, the girl was not stupid. She knew they were trying to get rid of her. But her father said "Don't argue". So she went. The girl walked on, until she came to a clearing in the forest. In the middle of the clearing, there was a hut. And a very skinny dog. The dog was starving. The girl said to the dog "You look hungry". So she fed it. Baba Yaga's house. Hello, I'm Devon Tompkin Stockard. Young Ranger. I'm selling thumbprint cookies. All proceeds go to the Pine Cone Charity House, of McCade County. Is it a '65 Ford? The '65 F-100 is the best motor Ford ever made. Is it 3 on a tree? Yeah. My uncle had a truck like that. He was Russian, from Indiana. Born on the wrong side of the train. Wrong side of the tracks. Right. He said the mounts were going bad on the truck. So one night he drove it into spoon river. - And never drove back out. - What a shame! That's what my aunt said. You can rebuild the mounts. I did. Can you take me for a ride in it? I don't want to buy any... cookies. This is private property. Go home. 4 bags? Does that include the 2 that we bought? You'll have to do better than that. How far did you get down the list? It all depends on your face sweetheart. It's not what you got in the bags they want to buy, it's your happy face. The ones that weren't home today, try tomorrow. Don't forget to say it's for the charity house. It'd be a shame if some other little girl got her picture in the paper. - You'll do better tomorrow sweetheart. - Give me a kiss. Goodnight, sweetheart. I'll be up in a little while. I changed your doctor's appointment for the day after tomorrow, at 9:30 A.M. Morton: I'd like to see her happy for a change. Clare: She's going through a stage, it's her age. Yeah, but all we get is mope and complain. Imagine what she'll be like in a few years? She hardly complains. She could at least pretend to be happy. I mean when I was a kid, that's what you did for you parents. We've only been settled for a couple of months. Give it time. She's met that one girl. Donna? Oh, I feel sorry for that Donna kid's father. Imagine a-ow- daughter with a face like a possum. She's got a lovely voice. If I'm gonna have a voice at all, we've gotta start pushing. Elections for the County Board are this fall. - That will be 4 boards you're going after. You'll have to be careful you don't lose your own voice. If I want a real say in this county, in this suburb right here where we live... then I've got to become 'The Board Man'. The model of citizen involvement. Isn't that why we moved back here? I want us all to make a home here, Dev. I want you to find lots of new friends. A popular girl's never bored... or boring. Look, honey... This is the new Dev. Right here. You don't have to tell your new friends anything about the old Dev, if you don't want to. And the new Devon, she's raring to go, isn't she? I love you, honey. The world's at your feet, sweetheart. Thanks, Dad. Aah! Halt squaw! You'd be doing the community a favour. Hello, Mrs. Stockard. Hello, Brett. You should call Spray Green Lawn Service. They'll wipe those weeds out in a couple of hours. I like to work up a little sweat. If you leave the root in, it'll grow back. Just ripping the heads off is more fun. Would you like to lend a hand? And do something useful this summer? Sounds criminal to me. You should both have Summer jobs. Keeps your mind sharp. If we had jobs, who'd help you weed? I'll just let you two finish up here, huh? Hey, isn't that my belt? Found it on the dresser. But how am I supposed to keep my pants up? You'll think of something. Hey, uh, Patty. You sure you don't want that ride? Country Club? Tables, tennis courts? No thanks, I can make it. And it's Pam, Pam Gregory. See you, trailer man. Hey, I'm not always gonna live in a soup can. Next year I'm gonna be at the, uh... White House. Baba Yaga went inside and put a huge kettle on to boil. The dog told the girl to run, 'cause Baba Yaga was going to cook her. But the girl knew she could never outrun Baba Yaga Bony Legs. When they sent the girl into the forest, she was kind to the things she found. She found a tree and dressed it up in ribbons. Trees don't give a shit about people. Was that your girlfriend? Look, I got some lawns to take care of, so... Can you climb a tree? I'd climb it myself, but I'm not supposed to strain. I'm telling you to leave. Ok, I'll leave... but only if you help me hang the rest of these ribbons. I don't like ribbons, and I got me a hangover. You know I almost died? Twice. - Climbing a tree? - No. - I almost died too. - How? Shotgun. You? It's a lemon, my heart. You know how yours goes: Dee-dum, dee-dum, dee-dum? Yeah. Well, mine goes: Dee-dee-dum, dee-dee-dum, dee-dee-dum. So are you dying or what? Not anymore. They put in an extra pumping station. Hmm, nice. Can I see your scar? - It's ugly. - Cool. Don't you have any friends your age? Kids you can hang out with and stuff. I don't like kids. They smell like TV, and they talk too fast. Higher. Go higher. Shit! Hey! I could be dying over here. Is your heart going: Diddy-dum, diddy-dum, diddy-dum? Something like that. Hey, come here. Get me a beer our of my truck. It's in the cooler, and the cigarettes are on the dash. Where'd you get shot? In the gut. By a robber? Look, I have to do 3, maybe 4 lawns. - You're Camelot, right? - Camelot Gardens, yup. Over the hills and far away. - It's better if I let you off here. - Yeah I know. Tracker. Sean: Be careful Devon. My dog doesn't like kids. Claire! People are getting hungry out here, dear. Tracker! Tracker! Leave the dog be, honey. Would you go tell her we're about ready for the salad? Alright. They need the salad, Mrs. Stockard. Yes, well... I should think we could have that ready in about 4 minutes. What do you say? Yes! The salad has arrived. Hello, can I help you? I finished your lawn, sir. I did the trimming as well and I blew the- - drive. Short back and sides. - Oh yes. We heard you loud and clear. - Worked up an appetite, son? - Oh. Devon, throw a couple of hot dogs on the grill for this young man. Oh, no, thank you, sir, but I better... I better go back to work. Nonsense, you go take a seat over there. Hey, I heard a rumour... that Pamela Gregory screwed you last night. Now, tell me that isn't true. What could you and her possible have in common? Ah, Brett, putting your social skills to work again. Yes, I am. So what you gonna be when you grow up, huh? Landscape designer? Conservationist? Hey, which colleges you apply to, boy? Real charmer isn't he? What about computer design? That's a solid choice. Everybody's going in for that these days. Yes, let's talk about exotic careers. High-diving, for instance. Say from... Bridges. Say single-lane bridges. Morton: Hot dogs coming up. - Plenty of ketchup for you, right? - Trent: Yeah. - Oh, thank you, sir. You wouldn't happen to know anything about all those lampshades keep disappearing around here, would you? - Um... I can't help you sir. - It's the funniest thing. I mean, what could a person do with so many lampshades? Sell them. Sir... For your lawn? - Oh. Yeah. Here we go. Here's 20. Here. Ahem. Uh, you're just $10 shy here, Mr. Stockard. Yes, what are you saying? I'm saying you're $10 shy of what we agreed on. I just gave you a couple of hot dogs, didn't I? Just pulling your leg there, son. Take that with you. Alright, meat's on! - Major burn, man. Hey. K-County School. Sean Taurus. Third grade, remember? No. I was only there a few months. My parents pulled me out and put me in private. - Oh yeah... Yeah. Yeah, your Dad drove that blue BMW. Did he? - I don't remember. - I remember. It was the only new car in the school parking lot that winter. We were friends, right? No, we was just in the same class. You should know better than to come to a party dressed like shit. In third grade, you had better taste. My bet is you could have made a good surgeon. Like your Daddy? You've got the hands for it. Go ahead, make my day. Daddy's gun, huh? That's pretty dangerous. You ever wonder... what one of these might feel like... going in? You smell like your mum. Get out! Mom, Tracy asked me if I could spend the night. - Tracy who? - Tracy Keller. You know, I met her at the picnic last week. You liked her parents. Her Dad's with the Federal Security Bank. Is he? Hmm. Alright, but later on. First you need to get the dolls out of the bath and their arms out of the sink. Ok! See? What did I tell you? She's made a friend already, just a matter of time. Don't wait! Can't I come in with you? No! I'll look like a kid, ok? Alright. I'll call you in a few hours. Try to have fun, sweetheart. Have a nice evening. I'd give you a ride home, but my tank's on empty. I'm not surprised. I'd rather bike, it's just up the road. Hey, Pam, when are you gonna give me your number? What do you need my number for? You haven't got a phone. No. But I got a quarter. Lucky man. So I'll see you around? Right, sure. Same time next week? Um, maybe. My schedule's kind of wacky, but, um, I'll drop by when I can. Hey, I want to be introduced to your mother... and your father... Any dogs, cats, or canaries you live with. Right, I'll see you around. I'm sure they'd love to meet me. Hi. What did it feel like when you got shot? It was like getting shot. Could you feel the bullet go in? Don't remember. I would have remembered if it happened to me. Shit. Got any whiskey? It stings, bit it kills the germs. - No. You're supposed to suck the poison out, or you die. What poison? I read it in a book on snakes. A snake didn't bite me. Then the next time one does, you'll know what to do. I'm not afraid of blood. Every time they opened me up, I lost a bathtubful. How much blood did you lose when you got shot? I don't know. - Did you nearly die? - Yeah, I guess I did. We was drinking me and Jeff, and we... ran out of beer, pulled over at the 5 store, and there's these 3 J-town cops, slurping on doughnuts and coffee. I know them and, they sure know me, so... I'm a-paying for my 12 of Bud, and I turn to the 3 of them, and I let out this killer burp. I mean, this son of a bitch was loud as a shotgun. Kind of ruined their snack, I guess. So 5 minutes later, they pull us over. Jeff gets scared. He makes a run for it. So now they think we got something to hide. And they're whacking me with their sticks, until finally I was able to punch one of them, and I busted his nose, and his buddy aims his shotgun at me. Bang bang. You're dead. Only I wasn't. What happened to Jeff? Mmm. Jeff was ok. He got, uh... 3 months. I got 6. Boy I tell you. People say you're trash. Yeah, I guess they do. I wouldn't like that. Well, you get used to it. My father says if everyone worked hard, there wouldn't be any poor people. You're a poor person, aren't you? He says that anyone who works hard, can be rich, just like him. Sounds like you got a smart Daddy. Trash is something you put a lid on 'cause it stinks. You don't smell that bad. That makes my day. The way I see it, you got people who own lawns, and you got people who mow them. And they're never the same people. Ok it's time for you to get on home. I told my mom I'd spend the night at Tracy Keller's. - Do you know Tracy Keller? - No. Neither do I. - Wait a minute. - So where do I sleep? - Go home. - No. Get out of here. Just go. What the hell you want from me? What? What? Huh? ...What? Is that what you want? You can have it. Anything you want here, it's yours. Take it. Ok? What's with you? You curious? You just curious? You got all that out there. Everything out there is yours. There's nothing here for you, you understand? Go home. Go home. Know where we can find two live chickens? Why don't we just drive to the supermarket? They have to be fresh, the ones at the supermarket... have been frozen for years, maybe longer. You know, stealing livestock's a criminal offence. We could go to jail. We won't be stealing them. We'll just be borrowing them. And then we'll change our minds and eat them. Trust me. Look, a chicken walk. Shh! They're trying to sleep. Trent! Trent, I caught one! Looks like your luck's changed, buddy. Just a few more minutes 'til the end of your life. Um, Tracy's fine. We're having chicken for dinner. Well, um, her mum can't come to the phone right now. She's having a bath. Got to go, mum. Tracy's waving at me. See ya. Love you. Bye. Do you think if we'd met hundreds of years ago, we'd still have ended up as friends? We're not friends. We're hunters. So who's gonna kill the meat? You do yours and then I'll do mine. - Mmm. Do you know how? - Not yet. If not promise never to pull this one on me again, I'll let you sleep over. What do you think your dad would do if he found out? He'd cut off my feet. That's right. And then he'd tie you to a stake and burn you. Baba Yaga bony legs, his teeth made of steel, and he can bite through trees, and his legs are like chicken legs. Hey, who is this Baba Yaga? A witch who lives in a forest. No, I mean what's this monster stand for? The moral of the story? Yeah. For whatever's bad, I guess. Sometimes, when it's dark, Baba Yaga goes out into the field, and a wild dog comes to meet him. And then a big, scary wind starts to blow and blow. Then Baba Yaga kills the dog with his bare hands, and eats it. Then Baba Yaga sings and dances, his belly all full of dog meat and blood. Do you know how the girl escapes from Baba Yaga? No. A starving dog she fed gives her a magic comb and an embroidered towel, and the girl runs away through the forest. And when Baba Yaga almost has her, the girl throws down the towel, and a great river springs up. And Baba Yaga can't cross 'til he drives his cows to drink up all the water. Look, I got to get up early, ok? When Baba Yaga's at her heels, the girl throws down the comb, - and a great forest springs up behind her. - The end, ok? That's the third one they got on your street this week. Someone is making fools of us. I've been watching the lamps in this neighbourhood at all hours, all hours. I don't like it one bit. We're insecure. Aah! Let's see some blood on the sand! Go on, bring the second squad! Go on! I've flown since I was a young man! We've gotta flatten Baghhad, by dawn! It won't take all day, will it? It'll take as long as it takes. Can I come? I can help you. I'll drop you off at the gates. I can pull weeds. No, but I'll make you a deal. We can be friends, if you can keep it a secret. What's wrong with you and me being friends? Well, for one thing, I'm a country bumpkin, right? I was born suckin' on a bottle of rotgut, And I'm a piss-poor retarded son of a bitch, who'd do anything for a buck. I slobber, and I spit. And I [Snorts] Fart. Pfft! - Hey! What are you doing? Put me down. And I eat little princesses like you for breakfast! Arrgh! I'm not a princess. No. Well, I'm still piss-poor. Do you want me to feel sorry for you? - Oh. I don't know. - Well, you can forget it. Polish my golden slipper. [Spits] Yes, ma'am. I'll polish it so shiny, I can see my face in it. Yeah! What you want to be when you grow up? When I grow up? I don't know. I don't think about it. Well, think about it. When I grow up... Oh I don't know, I just want to be gone. You know? Away from here. And one day I'm gonna save up enough money to do that, too, and I'm gonna put on a clean shirt, a new pair of socks, and I'm just gonna walk out of this life. - I like how it sounds. - How what sounds? Trent and Devon, Devon and Trent. Trent and Devon, Devon and Trent. Bullshit. When I was a kid, mum and my old man took me fishing here. In those days you could catch 5 or 6 big catfish. Big as your arm. Then one night, well, I just let the 2 of them fish, and I walk a ways down the bank, and I take my shorts off, and I plop myself down on the sand, in my bare ass, and I piss. - Yuck. No! No! There's nothing like the day cooling all around you, and you're sittin' in warm piss - with the river floating by. - Yuck again. Yuck again? I was a kid. Ok? What you piss in is yours for life. Come on up here. This is my river! You hear me?! This is my river! You hear me?! - Damn kids. - River rats. Sons of bitches. Well, that'll get the fish biting for sure, Nash. - Lets get out of here. Come on. - No, wait a minute! Come here. You know, I recognise that truck. It's that lawnmower kid. With one of his little tramps. Wait. What are they doing now? I'll be damned. They're mooning us. You don't look like you got much sleep at Tracy's. Did you have a good time, honey? Brett put his hand up my shirt yesterday. - At the barbecue? - What? You let him put his hand up your shirt? No. He just did it. You mean he forced his hand up your shirt? Hmm. Is that all? Nothing else? - I ran away. - Good for you. That's my girl. I had a good chat with Brett's dad at the barbecue. He's Vice President of Maxitel Kentucky. He told me he had a wild one on his hands with that boy. He was just tickling me. Oh, honey, why didn't you say so in the first place? He was just playing. Well, then he didn't mean any harm, Dev. You gave us a scare. Can I be excused? I don't feel well. Do you think Brett really upset her? She's just growing up. Well, she has her last doctor's appointment on Friday. I still think we should look into some plastic surgery options. She doesn't want it, at least, not for now. She'll want it when she starts dating. In a few years, if a boy like Brett feels that in the dark, - they won't be back for more. - Morton! What a waste. The guy just keeps on mowing. Just mows and mows like... it'll make a difference in the world. That man there isn't just mowing lawns. He's got a plan. First our lawns, then our women. He's just waiting to make his move. Jesus, Brett. That guy really gets under your skin doesn't he? How about we go to the mall and pick up some fresh sound? This stuff is stale. Oh, looks like we're running over Mexico there. That was a smart move, kid. Your go. That move , my friend, just cost you another arm and leg. Alright, one more. But you don't get too smart, doll face. If you lose this time... It will cost you your head. Can I bring him a glass of water? Why would you do that? Because it's hot. Well, that would be considerate. Oh, not one of the nice glasses, honey. There's a glass under the sink. It's perfectly clean. Hey, what's this? You got something on your dress. Hey. Trent, trent. Hey, stop it. Come on. Stop it. What are you doing? Come here. I want to show you something. Where'd you get it? Almost ran over it with the mower. Turtle spaghetti. He'll eat lettuce. Devon! Oh. I got to go. - Ok. Bye. Thanks! Don't bite me. What the hell? That son of a bitch! - What if he didn't take the CDs? - He took 'em. Who do you think's been taking the street lamps. - What if it's his only mower? - They always got a spare. Come on, let's go. Devon: He just gave me a turtle, mum. People don't just give away turtles. Has he spoken to you before? Yes. When? Listen to me, sweetheart. I'd rather you didn't talk to him anymore. People don't just give you things without wanting something in return. The next thing you know, he'll be asking your father for a job. He's got a job. There's probably something wrong with it. Looks like you got some sugar in your gas tank. Now, how did you manage that? Sugar will ruin a motor for sure. Just a minute there, son. I got a call from a woman that lives around here. She said you gave her daughter a turtle. Is that right? Yeah. I gave a kid a turtle. Now, why'd you go do a thing like that? Look, I like turtles. I used to go hunting them back up Harold's Creek when I was a kid, but... folks are nervous these days. It'd be best if you kept to yourself when you're working around here. - How's it going? - Mind if I get by here? Hey, I've been meaning to talk to you. It's about this lawn my grandmother has. Only problem is it's on her face. Think you can handle it? That's a nice mower. How's that running for you? Ok, now, uh... Get that car out of my way. What's the rush? We just got something we need to work out is all. Boy, look at this. This is ancient. I'll bet you could sell this for an antique, huh? Don't touch it. Brett, put it back. What's it feel like to play with a 4-foot-long vibrator all day, huh? Hey, Sean, let's trim some weeds. If you took the music, just give it back. - There'll be no trouble. - You owe us 4 CDs, river rat. - What'd you do? You sell them already? - What the hell are you talking about? - This is bullshit! You want some of this? - Brett! I'll cut you up, bitch! Goddamn it, Brett! What are you, crazy? You're bleeding. What do you want from me? Well, what have you got to offer? Get this fuckin' dog off of me! The punk bit me. -- Move my car. - Huh? -- Move it, damn it! Well... I could sell the truck, to get a new mower. But then how am I going to get the mower around? I could sell the chainsaw... and that might bring me enough to buy a half-assed mower, but then I'm going to be mowing with a piece of shit, and I'm going to be out of a chainsaw, to do tree work. So... You know what? Just fuck the whole thing. Fuck it. Where are we going? Trent? Want to come in? - Hey, mama. - Hey. - Hey, give me some sugar. - What happened to your face? - Oh, it's nothing, I just scraped myself. - What's this? - Oh I cut myself with the weed eater. - You want me to get you a new bandage? No, it's... Don't worry about it mum. - This is Devon, mama. - Well, nice to meet you, Devon. You look tired. Well... Your daddy could keep the whole county awake with his wheezing and kicking. - He's out back. - Yeah? You two look hot. You want some iced tea? Well, I do. Get us a couple of glasses out of the cupboard there, honey. Get the nice ones, the horse ones, for a change. I hope you like it sweet. Trent's daddy likes it real sweet. Well, now. How are you dad? Well, I'm still here. I lost a mower today. What, stolen? No, some kids put sugar in the motor. - Well, why would they do that? - Because they like me. Well, if you're worried about us... Is that why you come here? Hey, you know we do just fine on the pension. What you send us is a treat. Something extra. So we'll do without the extras. - Hell, I can't bowl no more anyway. - Sure, you can. - Now, listen... - No. Don't worry about it. Hey, it's not so bad. No, no. Not exactly. It's more like yours goes: Dee-dum, dee-dum, dee-dum. And mine goes: Diddy-dum, diddy-dum, diddy-dum. I picked these up during my years in Korea. Lots of guys would sleep with them under their pillows at night. And when a guy didn't come back... Well, I got his flag. -- Take them. - No, I don't want them. -- I want you to have them. I don't want them. I don't want them Dad. Goddman it, accept a gift! I don't want them around the house no more. I can't bring myself to throw them away. Just when are you going to die and get it over with, Dad? You've been doing it for years now. It takes a while to die. You think I don't know that? You think I don't know? You and your fucking flags! I don't want them. Ok? Send them to whatever bastards send you your pension! This one was always my favourite back then. Here. Feel how soft it is. Whose was this one? It was mine. Why is your father dying? Is it because of the Koreans? Did they torture him? The Koreans didn't fuck up my old man. It was the canned cheese. Government rations the soldiers got. The cans had some sort of bacteria in them, see? Of course the Government still denies it. It gets inside you. It lives in your lungs. It eats them up. Bit by bit. He had one lung cut out, some years back. He's got half of one left. You ever wonder how it'd be to live on half a lung? Gross. Do you want a cigarette? Do you want some cola? So what do you want to show me? We're best friends, right? - I don't know. - Yes, we are. I don't know as I ever had a best friend. I had a- - You gave me a turtle. - Yeah, I did. - Then I'll show you. - Whoa. No, no, stop that. Aw, Jesus. - I want to. - Well, I don't want you to. You're not old enough. It's not my tits I want to show you, stupid. Ok, I'm ready. Come on, look. Goddamn. My dad can hardly look at it. He says it gives him the cold shivers. - Touch it. - No. No, thanks. Go on. See? That's cool. Now I get to see yours. Fair is fair. - Mine's bigger. - Yeah. Can I touch it? It's Tracker. He's loose. Let's catch him. Tracker! Come here, boy! Devon: Tracker! - Stay in the car. - But he's hurt. I said stay in the car. If he's hurt, we'll take care of him. - Is he alright? - No... He's not. He's hurt bad. We'll take him to the vet. I want you to cover your eyes, ok, buddy? Why? Goddamn it, I said cover your eyes. Devon? Devon, what happened? Devon, what is it? Devon? Oh my God! I said I don't know! Just come home. Did somebody hurt you, honey? - He didn't hurt me. - Who didn't? - Trent. - Oh, my God. Trent? The man who mows our lawns? The one who gave her the turtle. You tell me about Trent, honey. Did he touch you? No-one's going to blame you, sweetheart. I'll call Nash. Christ. Devon, this is important. Did Trent touch you in any way? - Yes, but it was only because... - I'll kill the punk. Where did he touch you, honey? Show me where. I let him see my... He touched my... Take your time, sweetheart, we're listening. He touched my scar. -Oh Christ. He thought it was cool. And I touched him too. Where he was shot. We were friends. Secret friends. Oh, God. But then he killed the dog. I hate him. - Was it yours? - Yeah. - You know where he lives? - I'll, by God, find out. - He's got to be just up the road. - Alright, now you, better stay here with Mrs. Stockard. - You stay with me, sweetheart. - Dad... I know where he lives. - We'll try further up. - Right. Morton: That was a big help. Is this the road? Bingo. Stay in the car, Dev. - I warned you, Mr. Burns. - This here's private property. No. This is state property, and you and that tin can are trespassing. - What do you want? - We're looking for a dog. You seen one? You ain't no real cop. I don't have to talk to you. A big dog. Doberman. Wore a chain-link collar. This here is his owner. I'll tell you what... Why don't you all go to hell? He's got a sense of respect, doesn't he? I may not be a real cop anymore, but I can still act like one. - I loved that dog. - You touch my daughter? - What? Huh? - Is that the hand you used to touch her? She's 10 years old, you piece of shit. A girl like Devon will never belong to you. Nash: I think that's enough. Yeah? Just about. Here. Take a crack at him. - Morton. - Stay out of this, Nash. - This is a personal situation. - I said that's enough! Morton: Do it. Hit him! Oh, Jesus. Trent. - Get up. You have to get up. - Shit Devon. Jesus Christ, you shot him. Honey, give me the gun. - Stop! - Trent: He's bleeding, Devon. He's bleeding bad. Nash: We got to get him to a hospital, or he'll bleed to death. He won't die. I lost bucketsful, and I didn't die. They're going to pin this on me, Devon. They're going... They're going to pin this on me, you hear me? They won't. They're going to kill me, Devon. You understand? Not if you go, Trent. You have to get out from here now. Go... Go. Dev... Aw, Dev! Give me your wallet, Dad, or I'll shoot you. Better do what she says, Mr. Stockard, or I believe she will shoot you. -- Here. - No. -- Buy a new shirt, there's blood on yours. Here, hold the gun. We've slowed the bleeding, but we have to get him to a hospital. Morton? They're going to come after you. When they get close, throw down this towel. If they're still gaining on you, throw down this comb. Whatever happened at the end of that story? The girl got away. She ran and she ran, until she was home. Home. Yeah, tell me where that is, Devon. Home is in my hands. Now drive fast. Fast. Dev, honey... Get on your knees, Dad. You're just scared, honey. I'll tell them it was an accident. Kneel down. Stand up slowly. Walk straight. Stop, Yea, I need EMS for a gunshot victim. The wound is in the lower right abdomen. Once upon a time, in the middle of a big, dark forest, there lived a boy in a house, all alone. And he took care of the trees. And fed a stray girl, and was kind to her, and she loved him for it. But one day, Baba Yaga entered the forest to eat the boy. The boy wanted to run, but he knew he could never outrun Baba Yaga bony legs. The girl said to the boy: "Take this magic comb and embroidered towel," and run. When Baba Yaga chases you," throw down the towel, and a great river will rise up behind you," and cover your tracks." If Baba Yaga is still chasing you," throw down the magic comb," and a forest will spring up behind you." And the boy drove on and on, never coming back. Safe at last. Subtitling by ?Predasaurus?
