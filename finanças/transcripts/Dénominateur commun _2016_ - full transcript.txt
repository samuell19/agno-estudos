Common Denominator Hello. "Sir, Please find enclosed "the sample for testing, as agreed. "A molecule acting on the brain, "giving a feeling of greatness "and improving confidence." Is it coke or what? "Please report any side effects. "Yours sincerely." It's great! Imagine what we'll be able to do! Yes! Play multiplayer Mario Kart. Yes! No, I was thinking of chatting up Julie, the letterbox girl. Not bad. But... She's like Everest, big. We're a slag heap on the road to Douai. Exactly. What's happened to us can change things. We've always struggled with girls. - It's time for revenge. - You have a plan? Yes, I have a plan! We'll write her a letter saying we're too shy to talk to her and writing on paper is vintage. We'll add our number, and post it. And then? Then, we'll wait for her to send us a message. Hi Ted, it's Julie! Now we smooth-talk her. We can do that. We can do that. We hit it off and invited her for a drink. Great! See you later! We just have to get ready. Your letter moved me. Guys are often more brutish. I didn't really know what to do because I'm a bit shy. - That's so cute. - Good evening. - Good evening. - What can I get you? We'll have 2 big pints of beer. No. I like wine. OK, I'm on it. Suggest a Château l'Angelot. It's a red. If you like wine, we should have a Château l'Angelot. It's very tannic with a good aftertaste. - 2 Château d'Angelot? - Yes. You know wine? I trained as a sommelier. - Is it your job? - No, I test medicines. What a numpty! Medicine? She loves music. You're a musician. Actually, I'm in an group... to free lab mice, but I'm really a ukulele player. That's cool! - 2 Château d'Angelot. - Thank you. But isn't the medicine dangerous? - No! Let's clink glasses! You're quite unique. I slept here, you bastard! - Why are you there? - You have a small flat! Should I have invited her to hers? Who are you talking to? No one. I was reciting a poem. Bastard! - Oh, hello! - Hello. It's a bit soon for this, but it's my friend's birthday tonight. I don't want to go alone. Do you want to come? Yes, yes, yes... Why not? Yes. - Good evening! - Aurélie, this is Ted. We just met. Aurélie... what? Aurélie Fache. Why? I thought I knew you, but no. Well, come in, come in! It's cold out there. Welcome! Aurélie Fache. Facebook public profile. Easy! She loves geraniums and little dogs. How old is she? We'll get her guest list. We need names. - Virginie. - Isa. - Isa. - Christophe. Chris! Good to meet you. Hard to remember. I'll take the guys. You share the girls. OK. - And the new Dolan? - Interstellar? No, Dolan, not Nolan. Yes, I know. It was a joke. Don't take initiatives, big guy. On Twitter, she says it's a killer. The scene with the mom... It's a killer. The scene with the mom... I agree. - Christophe preferred Mommy. - But Mommy is still his best. - The latest Dolan? - Who's that? - New people! This is bad, guys. We'll need backup. It's like Ray Bradbury's The Martian Chronicles. We were saying that too. Excuse me. Shit, the battery's dead! You didn't recharge it? What an idiot! Shit, shit, shit... Are you OK? Yes. I'm going home. I'm really tired. No! Everyone loves you here. I love everyone. But I need to get home. I'm up early tomorrow. OK. I'll go with you. Come on. - Don't sulk! - I'm not! I'm really tired. I'm going home. You shouldn't come. I'm going to sleep. - No. - Oh, fuck! Shit! No! Come back! That's not a good idea! Julie! No! Give me back my keys!
