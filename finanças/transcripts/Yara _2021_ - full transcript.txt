NETFLIX PRESENTS Are you absolutely sure? Is it her? - What's the condition of the body? - It's in an advanced state of decay. How long has she been there for? Months. - Months?

No, she doesn't have ID. - What is she wearing? - Black tights... - Leggings, you mean? - You're right, leggings. Oh God! - And... a jacket, also black. - Mm. And sneakers. You know, the ones with fur inside. - Mm. You're staying there, right? - Yeah, yeah, sure thing. The family has to be informed right away. I'll take care of it. All right. Thanks. - Ma'am, is it true she's been... - Leave me alone. Hello? Maura, it's Letizia. I'm sorry... But... Ma'am. Maura. Maura, are you there? Maura! Fulvio. Maura. Can you hear me, Maura? Fulvio! Maura. Maura. Calm down. Calm down, Maura. HERE WE ARE READY FOR ANOTHER YEAR SILVER FOREVER EMANUELA MACCARINI As far as I'm concerned, rhythmic gymnastics is the greatest sport of all. This year, I really have to step it up. which means no matter what, every Wednesday, I go to the gym. Yara, thirteen, in eighth grade. And my name comes from Arabic. It means "butterfly." Every single time, I have to show my friends how to spell it. THREE MONTHS EARLIER I'll bring my dad's stereo. Don't worry about it. Children, did you wash your hands? Yes, Mom. - Can I trust you? - Yes. What a week. Today, I got stellar marks in four subjects. This weekend I'm getting my braces removed, and as for lunch... Who knows what Mom and Dad are cooking up. Usually, it's better when Mom takes care of it on her own. Mom, Yara isn't doing her homework. She's writing in her diary that Dad can't cook. - Come on, Keba, stop it. - It's kind of true, though. Why are you saying that I can't cook? - Yuck! What did you make? - Actually, a delicious casserole. - Yeah. - Careful. It's hot. Don't touch it yet. I've got to get the sauce first. I'll serve it up. And are you going to use your hands? Cutlery! Of course, of course, of course. Anyway, I'm going to finish my homework before I bring the stereo. I can take it to the gym on Sunday. I'm going there anyway to set up the equipment. No, I wanna go, to say hi to Giommi who does hip-hop. - But I want you back by 6:30. - But 6:30 is when they start. Come on. I won't be long. It's in walking distance. I'll be home by 6:45. - At the most. - Okay, fine. - Not "fine." Forty-five tops! - Understood. Good girl. Sveva says I don't need to get her a birthday present, as long as I help her organize the party. She's my best friend. So super present it is. Girls. We have the stereo. - Hi. - Hi, Yara. - Ready? - Yeah. Go. Play. - Come, Yara. Join us. - No, no, no. Come on. Come on. Come on. Go. Five, six, seven, and... Sometimes I think I'd like to take up hip-hop too, but I wouldn't have the time. There's never enough time for anything these days. Hi, this is Yara. No, it's my voicemail. Leave a message after the tone. Later. Good evening, Nico. It's Maura. Is Yara still there, by any chance? I haven't seen Yara around, but I'll ask Daniela. Did you see Yara? Yara left around 6:30 or thereabouts. Well, I'm being told that she left around 6:30. Okay, thanks. Bye. So, I'm having dinner with my boss. Why isn't Yara back yet? She was supposed to be here half an hour ago. - You must have misunderstood. - I go straight to voicemail every time. Her phone must be dead. Why don't you call Martina or... or Paola? I may as well go there myself. Maura. Sorry to bother you. I'm looking for Yara. Sometimes she's in the gym over there. Hi, this is Yara. No, it's my voicemail. Leave a message after the tone. Hi, this is Yara. No, it's my voicemail. Leave a message after the tone. Later. Hi, this is Yara. Mr. Gambirasio, what's happened? Take a seat. Yes. It's about my daughter, Yara. She hasn't come home. I, uh... I brought a photo of her, in case it helps you. Take a seat. It's all right. Tell my colleague everything for the report, okay? Don't worry. So... my wife, um, since she didn't come back, walked down to... the sports center. Uh, and, um... She couldn't find... She's not... She's not answering her phone. It must be off, or I don't know... how... how I can... how I can help you. Don't worry, sir. Don't worry. Don't worry. You'll see. We'll find her. And where's Mr. Gambirasio now? He was exhausted. He went home. I thought there was no need to keep him here longer. Good call. - Time and place of the disappearance? - This evening, in Brembate. The girl didn't make it back home from the sports center. What does the family say? Um... Was there an argument, a fight, could she have run away? According to the father, absolutely not. Have you got the tracking location request back from the phone company? I did. So here's what we got, ma'am. We found that the last cell tower it pinged off was at 6:55 p.m., in Ruggeri Street. Basically, at the other end of the sports center. In Ruggeri... Yes, like your last name. It's a mystery. A mystery over the disappearance of a 13-year-old girl in the Bergamo area, who went out in the afternoon, like most young people of her age, to go to the gym. She never made it back home. The possibility she might have run away has been ruled out, instead the hypothesis of a kidnapping is being explored. And let's hear from Andrea Soglio. The people of Brembate Sopra, a small town in the Bergamo area, are living in anguish since Friday night, when a 13-year-old girl, Yara Gambirasio, went missing. The alarm was sounded right before dinner time. At the time of her disappearance, she wasn't carrying any bags or backpacks, not even a wallet, only her cell phone, which is currently off. Excuse me, what are you doing? I'm sorry, miss. I have orders. Well, why my computer? There's nothing about Yara. Hey, Dad! They even took my computer. That's... that's Yara's diary. Hey, hey. Honey, come here. Hey, you're strong. BERGAMO TWO DAYS LATER Oh, Marshal Garro, finally. - Come in. - Ma'am, good morning. Any news about the girl? Unfortunately, nothing. And at the gym, what did they say? - Apparently, she left at around 6:30 p.m. - "Apparently"? What does that mean? At 6:30 on a Friday night, somebody must have seen her, no? Unfortunately, we haven't managed to find a witness yet. And how far from her house is the gym? About 700 yards. That's what I'm saying. At some point, someone must have seen her. Look, from what we've managed to gather so far, that day, the girl was not supposed to go training. She was just going to the gym to drop off a stereo. She stayed for a while, then she left. At least, she should have left. We've expanded the search in the towns around Brambate with the whole investigation unit. And the search dogs? We've requested them, but it'll take a few days. We can't get them sooner. They're from abroad. - The phones? - The whole family is tapped. That's not enough, Marshal. We have to extend it. Neighbors, teachers, uh, friends, and also gym instructors... Of course. I think it's... a great idea. Marshal. Tell me. What do you make of this? I think that... Well, it seems unlikely that she ran away. They all say she was a good girl. She had absolutely no reason to run off. She was most likely kidnapped but not for a ransom. They're not a wealthy family... I mean, both parents work, and yes, they do own a house but nothing more. Perhaps a retaliation. I don't know. Her father is a surveyor. He works as a systems engineer, so he says he has no enemies. At least that's what he claims. It could be a retaliation linked to the world of construction. We're looking into it in case something comes up. - Do you want to meet them? - No, no. The reports are enough for me, for the moment. When the time comes, I'll let you know. All right. - Mom. - Hmm? Where is Yara? We are looking for her everywhere, honey. That's why Mom's been working longer hours. But is it true that there are ogres around hunting for children? No. Listen, you have nothing to worry about. At school, each of us made a drawing. We also all said a prayer for Yara, so she comes home in time for Christmas. Good. That's very good. People say sadness is caused by the memory of happiness. Perhaps that's why our moods come and go just like memories. From being happy, I switch to complete darkness, then I'm happy again. When I feel like crying, though, I hold back. I'm not going to give you the satisfaction. You'll never see me cry. No, sorry, I'm not following. On Friday night, were you there or not? No, I told you. I was at home last Friday, so I didn't see Yara. Then, after midnight, I was called by Daniela and Silvia, who wanted to come here and look for her. Yara? Yara? Yara? - Yara? - Girls, I'm checking in here. Yara? Yara? Ma'am, can we offer you a coffee or something? No, no, thanks. I've drunk too many. Obviously, as you can imagine, at this point, any detail, any element is deeply crucial for us. Can you recall... that Friday night, anything useful, like what Yara wore and so on? So, ma'am, uh, Yara came to my class. She brought the stereo, but, uh... she didn't wanna dance with us. And, well... she was in a hurry. She couldn't stay long. I'm wondering, though, was there anyone who came to watch the girls training? Do you remember? Someone who wasn't either a parent or a relative? Did you ever hear the story of the pervert? No. What pervert story? Actually, this story has been circulating for years. We tried our best, but we could never find out if there was someone spying on the girls. Meanwhile, as a result, male relatives have been banned from entering the locker rooms, including the boys' locker room. Everyone. Did you notice anything unusual that Friday? No, nothing. After that, I went upstairs to teach synchro gym, and when I came down, Yara had already left the gym. I'm sorry. Out of the way, please. Out of the way. - Ma'am. - Are the dogs here? Where is everyone? The dogs sniffed one of Yara's sweaters and took off. And Garro? He followed them. He said you should join him. Okay. We can go. Good morning, ma'am. This is the site manager. - Nice to meet you. - You too. This is Prosecutor Ruggeri. Ma'am, the dogs smelled something in that direction. And what's over there, sir? The workers' changing room. Below that, there's a storage room. - Let's go. - I'll show you the way. Careful with the nails. Calm down. I'll explain later. Yes, I see. They're onto something. Let's seize the site right away. We need to identify all of them, then call the forensics and get them to examine the area inch by inch. Will there be snow? Oh, yeah, a lot. In that case, do we get to ride on the sleigh? That depends. Only if you manage to drink a whole cup of hot chocolate at the chalet afterward. Oh, Mom! I'll come get you at school, so we can go spend the whole day up there. Hmm? The clerk told me I'd be sure to find you here. Colonel Vitale. It's been a while since Caltanissetta. Indeed. Let's go to my office. Okay. Give me a hand? Of course. Didn't you know the unit was sending me? Yes, Garro let me know. He's a marshal at this station. - He's meticulous. - Extremely. - He says we currently don't have much. - We don't have anything. We set up CCTV, tapped phones, conducted searches. Nothing. Sometimes you don't need to look too far. I know by experience. Please. Take a seat. Obviously, we investigated the family first, but nothing came up. There is something. The father. We heard a sort of plea that he left on his daughter's voicemail. "Please, Yara, come back now." Yes, I know. Well, "Please, Yara, come back now" sounds like it's happened before. Doesn't it? To me, it sounds like a father trying to not get mad at a daughter who's late. Fulvio Gambirasio has changed jobs several times. Apparently, on the building sites, he's a scrupulous man. He's very stern with his coworkers. Perhaps he's made some enemies. We thought about that, but honestly, I'm not buying it. He may be stern but not to the point of triggering such a retaliation. What's more, all your coworkers from the unit agree that the Gambirasios are a good family. And what do you think? I haven't met them yet. No? And maybe you're planning to? Oh, I'm planning to, as soon as I have more to tell them than, "Be strong." "It's going to be okay," or, "We'll find her," which seems to have become a national obsession. There are two ways to look at tomorrow. Some think of it as a day sealed between two nights. Pardon? And some prefer to think of tomorrow as a night sealed between two days. You're quoting an entry from Yara's diary. Mm-hmm. It's quite a somber, adult, very deep, and masculine line. No, I don't believe that a 13-year-old girl came up with it. You? Who was Yara hanging out with? Older guys coming to her house, her sister's friends... We investigated them first, but nothing came up. Here. This is the original diary. Ah, you see? It's a quote by Don Mazzi. Sometimes appearances can be deceiving. You're right, ma'am. The mountain isn't going anywhere. - We'll go next week, sweetie. - Yeah. Hey, pumpkin. - Here. - No, I don't want it. Aren't you going to say goodbye? Our class is very divided. There are those who mock others. Those who crack jokes, and a few small groups, such as mine. My best friends are in it, Ludo, Ale, Sveva, and Ginny. No. What bullying or harassment? Absolutely nothing of the sort. Come on. Are you telling me this is the most perfect school in Italy? Just kids' stuff. Some hide in the restrooms to smoke a joint, just like in every school, but Yara was never involved in any of this. We've already told the police. Yes, but I prefer to talk about it in person. Look at this. This is from Yara's diary. "Today, he basically stood next to me," with a lot of exclamation marks, little hearts. So it's obvious Yara did like someone. Isn't it? Yes, but it was an innocent crush, nothing more. He's just the typical cute, popular kid. I heard Yara never even told him she liked him. Come, I'll point him out to you. Today, he basically stood next to me. I'm yours because your smile is what makes me feel good. I'm yours because when I'm with you, I feel big, important. Today, during religious studies, I kept my eyes closed for two minutes. And silently, I felt what I feel outside and inside myself. I'm growing. I'm changing. Just like in my favorite song. And anyway, life is a twist of events, in a theater full of surprises. The whole community, we could say the whole country, is very anxious over Yara's fate. There was an anticipated conference with the top investigators, but it didn't lead to any new information from the prosecutor's office. With each passing hour, the tension is increasing in the area. We're in front of the Gambirasio house, but they haven't shown up. Meanwhile, the search continues round the clock. Every square foot of the neighborhood is being searched. The whole population is cooperating. Senator Nigiotti gave the following statement. I spoke at length with the relevant authorities, and I'm quite sure, and I'm saying this, as a father, as a family man, and a representative of the people, that we'll find Yara as soon as possible, and we'll bring her home safe. Yes, come in. Oh, Prosecutor Ruggeri, good morning. Good morning. Please, take a seat, ma'am. No, I'd rather stand, thanks. So, any progress? What's up? We're investigating, sir. The search dogs led us to a building site in Mapello. They might have kept the girl there. Ugly case. And if we add up all the pressure... Nothing like this has happened before. Anyway, I want to tell you something. You can always count on me, Prosecutor. In fact, with this in mind, let me tell you that... in case you needed to be flanked by someone, don't hesitate to ask. Okay? - Be flanked by someone? - Yes. I mean, in case you need it, an assistant, a backup, someone to help you... It would appear as a sign of great responsibility. Thank you. Well, in case I need it, I won't hesitate to let you know. Absolutely. Good. Good. However, in Caltanissetta, I was working on Mafia and murder cases. I'm not exactly an amateur. I know. But here, you see, it's different. Yes, sir. Doubts and the pressure come from higher up, and it's understandable. Good thing that the judiciary is independent, then. Good morning, Mrs. Gambirasio. I'm Letizia Ruggeri. Good morning. This is my husband, Fulvio. - Welcome, ma'am. Please, take a seat. - It's a pleasure. - You can put this here. - Yes, yes. May I take your jacket? Yes, thank you. We've gathered a few more pictures if you need. We have a few with short hair... Uh, with long hair, and... Maybe you can use them. They only seem to show the one picture we gave to the marshal. I apologize for, um... the hustle and bustle, the journalists. I'd have come earlier, but... ...the information you gave to the investigators was sufficient in terms of... what we needed. So I decided to avoid pressuring any further. And so, now have you... made any progress? No. I'm sorry. At the moment, I have no news. Sorry, ma'am. Yeah. If you don't have any news, why did you come here today, then? Listen. What I said before, that, um... we got all the information we need from you, and that I have no doubts, it's all true. But then I was wondering if in the last few days, since the first report, you've remembered an episode at home, I don't know, an argument or a fight, any reason you can think of that might have led Yara to run away of her own will, you know. I wish that was the case. I... I understand that you have to ask everything... ...including things that hurt us. And I also understand that you must question me and my wife separately. Just... ...if you don't mind if you could kindly avoid asking certain things here, in Yara's room. Hey. I'm sorry. You're right, sir. Garro, go ahead. Ma'am, we have the wiretap of one of the workers on the site in Mapello, a Moroccan guy, Mohamed Fikri. The translator reported Mr. Fikri saying, quote, "May Allah forgive me, I didn't kill her." Then he burst out crying. And where is he now? Well, if you're ordering us to... Of course, I'm ordering you! Arrest him right now. Do it immediately, Marshal! I'll proceed immediately. Bye for now. Fikri Mohamed. We checked. He's actually on board the Berkane ferry, which is coming from the port of Genoa. We've alerted our patrol boat. They're leaving right now. Get going, then. We need to catch him before he enters the international waters. - Good morning. - Good morning. - They're all upstairs waiting for us. - Good. What do you mean? What? I don't understand. What did I say? Here it is. Take a look. "Allah, forgive me. I didn't kill her." What? No. It's wrong. I only said, "Please God, let her answer." I confirm it's true. You got the translation wrong. By "her," I meant my girlfriend. She broke up with me, and I was crying. - That's really all I said. - But you were escaping. No! It was a trip. For a year, I've been wanting to see my family. I haven't been back home for two years. - Are you saying it was a planned trip? - Yes. I bought the ticket back in May. You can check. Yes, but this doesn't prove anything because you might have taken advantage of the planned trip to your hometown to get away when things were getting dangerous for you. Ma'am, Mr. Fikri has an alibi. He was with his foreman, Mr. Scarli. Well, we actually timed it. From the building site where Mr. Fikri works to the Morlotti gym, it takes exactly four minutes. Therefore, Mr. Fikri could have easily kidnapped Yara Gambirasio before Mr. Scarli arrived at the building site to pick him up. I haven't done anything. I didn't say anything. Nothing! As God is my witness! Calm down now, Fikri. Finally, a breakthrough in the investigation on the murder of Yara Gambirasio. It seems a Moroccan builder, Mr. Mohamed Fikri, might be involved, based on several unequivocal clues leading to him. Mr. Fikri had embarked in Genoa, on the Berkane ship bound for Morocco. The ship was intercepted at the limits of Italian territorial waters by a police patrol boat. The ship was brought back to the harbor so that the suspect could be taken into custody. Now it will be up to the authorities to assess the elements against Mr. Fikri and confirm the arrest. What are you doing, ma'am, smoking? No, I'm not smoking. Um... I want to double-check Fikri's wiretap transcript. Mm. I want more evaluations, and I want them right now. It's not that simple to find Arabic translators. You'll figure it out, Edoardo. Look around. But where? How about the Central Police Station? - It's right behind here. - Hmm. - The Immigration Office. - Immigration Office? Mm. See if someone's around. Ask them for a favor. - Yeah. - Be kind, Edoardo. All right, then, but throw that cigarette away. Good morning, I'm Mr. Carlini, from the DA's office. - The passport office? - Yes, I'll go with you. Thank you. Uh, this way, please. - Who's next? - Uh, the lady here. Oh, no, one at a time. One at a time. I'll play it now. Can you hear it? Okay, so ma'am, all of the eight people agree that the phrase they hear is... Please, God, let her answer." Yes. All of them. What a clusterfuck! Oh, ma'am, it's not your fault at all. Whose fault, then? This is my case. All we want is a chance to express our thoughts. Peacefully. THAT'S ENOUGH It's our right! What can I tell you, Prosecutor Ruggeri? Frankly, I'm disappointed in you, very disappointed. I mean, wouldn't it be worse to send an innocent man to trial? Can you imagine if he was found guilty? Letizia, let me talk to you like a father. I've always had great respect for you. I've always liked you a lot. Thank God. But you know there is a time limit for this, like any other investigation. If we don't get any results, we'll have to file it. Time is running out. It's time for a breakthrough in this investigation. It's time to conduct it in a regular, conventional way. You mean, by a man. Leave. On behalf of the citizens who came to me, asking me to forward the government's request to every mayor and county, regional and parliamentary counselor, and specifically to the Minister of Justice and the Judges' Council, to revoke the mandate of Prosecutor Letizia Ruggeri, or at least have her flanked by a prosecutor of proven experience. Too many mistakes have been made during the investigation of this horrible crime, which has hit straight at the heart of our people. It's a sort of a reverse racism, a civil liberties hypocrisy, constantly preventing us from finding the truth. Let me give you a couple of examples. The release of Mr. Fikri, and the failure to search the van with which the Moroccan had embarked to Tripoli. Tangiers, you idiot. The failure to search dozens of workers at the Mapello site, all foreigners. By the way, it'd be interesting to see if they're all legally registered. Ma'am, can you open the door? My hands are full. I'm coming. - Thank you. - Oh, thank you, Edoardo. Thing is, it must be cold by now. Uh... The boss, didn't he comment? No. But, ma'am, you must have heard about the petition to have you removed. Mmm. I was just about to send a fax. You're not planning to resign, right? - Prosecutor Ruggeri, good morning. - Good morning. I waited to call you because I wanted to give you confirmed information. Yes? But I imagine you've heard already. That that Moroccan kid didn't... - He did not... - No. He had nothing to do with it. Yes, we heard it. We saw it on the news. Look, I'm sorry you're getting this news in this way but... Well, at least I'm happy that you let that kid go. - I mean, that he didn't do it, that is. - Yes. Believe me, this is not a setback but a step forward because right now, every step is a step forward. Yes. All right. And let me add that I understand that you need... No, it's not about us. It's just that we don't know what to tell our kids, our children. - Of course. - Um, they don't understand. And they're afraid. Actually, sorry. I can't possibly imagine. - Hi. - Excuse me, where's Vittoria? I guess, try in the dance room. Maybe she's still there. Oh, yes. Thank you. Mom. Vittoria, where the fuck were you? I've looked for you everywhere! I told you a thousand times to send me a message, didn't I? You can't disappear like that. I'm sorry, Mommy. I wanted to eat something. I got myself a snack. I'm sorry, my love. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. We are a simple family. We're a group of people who have founded their unity on love, on respect... ...on sincerity, on the cheerfulness of our quiet lives. For a month we've been asking ourselves countless questions about who, what, how, when, and why all this is happening to us. We are not looking for answers. We aren't interested in pointing fingers at anyone. But from the bottom of our hearts... ...we immensely desire for our daughter to come back to her world, to her town, to her house, to the arms of the people who love her. We beg for the mercy of the people who are holding Yara captive. We ask them to find again in their hearts a feeling of love, and after looking into her eyes, to open the door or the gate that keeps her from her freedom. We ask you to give us back our daughter. Considering the lack of clues, let's start from what's missing. There's no signs of a fight in the street. No one hears her screaming. No one heard anything at all. At 6:30 in the evening, in between houses? A stone's throw from a gym with about 50 people inside coming and going? I don't think so. No. No. I'm sorry but... It doesn't square with a strong, healthy 13-year-old girl being dragged away by unknown kidnappers. I have read her diary every day. This girl doesn't disappear in silence. And in order to disappear like that, in less than 700 yards, it takes a vehicle. But there were no skid marks at all on the road, which means that whoever was driving, was calm and not in a hurry. Let's take a wild guess. Let's imagine that someone approaches her. Offers her a lift. She is running late, so she accepts. That means it's someone she knows. Someone she has seen before. Someone who might be helping us with the search, combing through the fields with the officers, drinking coffee with FEMA and even laughing at us! It's nothing short of an army, including law enforcement and volunteers. Over 300 people are combing through the region looking for a clue, any detail that could help find Yara. All of this with the typical willpower and discretion that define the people of Bergamo, an attitude at times misunderstood by the national mass media, but that has never undermined these people's desire to make themselves useful and give their precious help. Once again, Senator Nigiotti spoke out, denouncing the ineffectiveness of the investigation, insinuating that it is due to the competition between the different law enforcement agencies. I don't usually come out to deny false news, but I feel compelled today, in front of you, to say that these rumors about clashes between police forces are entirely unfounded. I am proud to have started my career in the police force, but... the first report was taken by the police. Therefore, they're the ones who kicked off the investigation. I want to thank the police force and the forensic police for the help they've been giving us and will continue to offer. So, any questions? Prosecutor Rugerri, do you suspect foul play? Prosecutor Ruggeri! NOD NOT ONLY DANCE Marshal, there's a venue near here. What's the name? "Not Only Dance"? What is it, a club? Yes, it's a nightclub, Colonel. That one there. There was a murder, a month ago. It was a brawl that ended badly, if I'm not mistaken. What if the murderer chose this place because he's familiar with it, regularly passing by here because he goes clubbing over there? I don't know. A lot of people pass by here. Bikers doing motocross, hookers, people flying model aircraft... Yes, but now we have other cell towers to sift through. Let's start with those in Chignolo. I'll cross-check with the ones in Brembate. The ones in Brembate. - And if there are matching users... - We can narrow it down. Okay. Today, in a field in Chignolo d'Isola, any residual hope of finding Yara Gambirasio alive was finally extinguished. The young girl had disappeared three months ago without a trace. The body, in an advanced state of decay, was found in the afternoon, and unfortunately, the discovery seems not to leave any room for doubt. It's a heavy blow to our community, to all of Italy, to all of those who looked for her under the illusion of finding her alive. The fact that the murderer, because we're talking about a murderer, is still walking among us, is cause for deep concern and pain. Always running around. Run, Yara. Come on, Yara. Run, run, run. Okay, so, Edoardo, follow me. - Okay? - Uh-huh. The M.E.'s report says there are multiple blows to the back of her neck, her skull, under her jaw, and her left cheek. A heavy blunt instrument. Then we have six large cuts, stab wounds, one to her throat, one to her wrist, and four to the back. Presumably, inflicted with a blade, or a cutter, but the murder weapons have never been found. I even asked an expert if, by any chance, the blows could be ritualistic, satanists, members of a cult, who knows, but... He ruled that out. No, because... ...blows are random. It was... ...blind violence. My goodness. Yes, but the blows didn't cause her death, as a matter of fact. No, because the wounds were not deep enough to reach her vital organs. Her death was probably... ...caused by hypothermia. - And are there traces of... of, um... - No. No direct sexual violence. She must have tried to escape, you know. Poor baby. He caught her. Knocked her out. Hit her on her back. Wounded her body. And then... he left her there. In the cold, still alive. But the motive is sexual. It's clear from the cuts on her leggings, here, and on her underwear. He only stopped because he got scared. He got scared? Yes, we're talking about an inexperienced man, insecure. Yeah. Now he's done it. The dam is broken. And if we don't stop him, he'll do it again. Uh, did you read this part, ma'am? There were traces of lime powder in her lungs and iron particles on her clothes. Of course, of course, which brings us back full circle to the world of builders, the site of Mapello... And perhaps to Fikri, yeah. No. Fikri's got nothing to do with it. If there is a solution, it's in the hard evidence. PARMA R.I.S. CENTRAL HEADQUARTERS Good morning, ma'am. Lieutenant Colonel Emiliani of the C.S.I. unit. Oh, good morning. What have you got? We waited for the control test. The result is confirmed. There's foreign DNA on Yara's underwear and leggings. - I'll be there in two hours. - Thank you. As I said, we found DNA other than Yara's. We know for a fact it's male DNA, mixed with the girl's. Blood, saliva, seminal fluid? Neither saliva nor seminal fluid, most likely blood, yeah. He cut himself while hitting her. It's possible. We've got more evidence too. We use state-of-the-art procedures. We are almost 100% certain he is of Indo-European descent. Not Moroccan. Not Moroccan, nor African. He's local. And there's a 94% chance he has light eyes. In the States, we'd have a DNA database, but in Italy, unfortunately or fortunately, there's no such thing yet. So we have DNA, but not a suspect to match it to. An unknown subject. Exactly. So that's what we're going to call our suspect, Unknown 1. And we'll use Unknown 1's DNA to get started. And how? Comparing his DNA. With whose? With everyone's. Everyone we can. Everyone who was in contact with Yara. We'll create a database for this case. So, if I've got this right, ma'am, you're suggesting to investigate the other way around, using the DNA to find the murderer. Exactly. But who's ever done that? And how much will it cost? - No one's done it. And it will cost a lot. - So, there's your answer. The fact that it's never been done doesn't mean it can't be done. Come on. We finally have some tangible material to work on. We can sample Yara's relatives, her acquaintances, people hanging out at the gym, her school, the Mapello building site, the supermarket, and the club. Whoever took her to the Chignolo field, didn't do so by chance. The new course of the investigation, involving the search for the murderer's DNA throughout Brembate and in the vicinity, has seen gazebos of the Red Cross and FEMA pop up everywhere like mushrooms to collect swab samples. For the time being, tests are run on a voluntary basis, but this system is raising serious concerns. The debate among political forces is raging. Many blame Prosecutor Ruggeri for stretching the limits of our constitution. Others claim instead that an excessive concern with civil liberties will only end up protecting criminals. - Next please. - Guys, that is tedious. Oh, come on, Guerinoni. - Damiano? - Hey. - Where are you now? - I did the swab. It's disgusting. - So what are you gonna do? - Nothing, heading home. See you soon. ROME, A YEAR LATER FORENSIC POLICE CENTRAL HEADQUARTERS - Yes, Miss Crivelli. - Prosecutor, we've got it. Look at the compatibility. These two biological profiles are a 50% match. It means Mr. Guerinoni is a direct relative of Unknown 1. We're getting closer, then. I really think so. He's with me. You can turn it off. Please, please. Follow me. I've never met this Yara Gambirasio. You can't charge people for going to a club, right? That's not the reason. We believe you, Mr. Guerinoni. We know the DNA found on Yara's clothes was not yours. Then why did you call me in? We called you in because your DNA partially matches the DNA of Yara's murderer. The haplotype Y, to be precise. The... the hapoply what? Uh, I don't know... I don't know what that means. I don't... It means that you're relatives. No. No. Yes. You're related by blood on the paternal side. Any relatives, cousins, or uncles from your father's family side? Uh... I have, uh, three cousins and... Vittoria, Paolo and Marcello. Uh, I don't... Should I call a lawyer? No, Mr. Guerinoni, you're not being investigated. Don't worry. So, Vittoria Guerinoni has been living abroad for years. Both Paolo and Marcello Guerinoni gave us their samples voluntarily. And these are the results. There are many match points, as you can see, with Unknown 1's DNA, for both of them. But neither of them matches 100%. So we're getting closer, but it's not them for sure. No, it's not them, neither of them, and neither is the sister, who's female. But their father, Giuseppe Guerinoni, might be Unknown 1's father too. The father could be the murderer's father, but not one of the three siblings is Yara's killer. Is that right? Exactly. This doesn't help, of course. - Wait a minute. - There it is. Unless there's a fourth brother born outside of wedlock. That's precisely what I wanted to tell you, ma'am. The problem, however, is that in order to be sure, we would need the DNA of Giuseppe Guerinoni. And he died 15 years ago. Okay. A YEAR AND FOUR MONTHS AFTER FINDING YARA Don't say that. It's impossible. Our only children are Vittoria, Paolo, Marcello. That's all. How about... a child who was born from another marriage, from a previous relationship? What relationship, huh? My... My Giuseppe was only married once, and to me. And there are no other children around. I understand. No. It's not true at all. No, you don't understand. No. And you got your calculations totally wrong. And... And you came here to... to harass simple, helpless folk. - It's not right. It's not right. - Ma'am, listen. We didn't dream up the laboratory data. In order to make sure, we need a DNA sample. What DNA? Whose DNA? Your husband's. Did you happen to keep any of his clothes? Here. It's all in there. And is it okay for Dr. Prosperi to take a shirt? Of course. His clothes are clean, you know, because I wash everything, once a month. You've washed everything, every month for 15 years? Yes, of course. We'll never find any DNA here. Uh, listen, ma'am, would you happen to have your husband's driver's license? Yes, two. Two. A regular one and, uh, one for... for agricultural vehicles. Look. Does it mean Giuseppe Guerinoni is Unknown 1's father? Bingo. I wanted to tell you... thanks for coming in personally. - It's my duty. - Well, I don't take it for granted. Why? Don't get me started. REST IN PEACE The DNA analysis carried out on Giuseppe Guerinoni's belongings confirms at 99.99% that Unknown 1 was, in fact, his son. I can't believe it. But he was born from a mother other than Guerinoni's wife, a woman with whom he had other children. This is insane. Therefore, according to these results, Unknown 1 is the offspring of an extramarital relationship of Mr. Guerinoni. So, now, in order to find Unknown 1, you must look for the mother. Giuseppe Guerinoni worked for years as a bus driver serving several towns up and down the Bergamo province. We should, therefore, look for any possible trace of this relationship that led to the birth of Unknown 1. Ma'am, does it mean you're going to sample the DNA of every woman in the area? Yes. All those who will volunteer to a DNA test, then we'll go from there. Prosecutor Ruggeri, Senator Nigiotti has launched a congressional probe into the enormous costs of this investigation. He's saying that so far, it hasn't led to any results, that you've wasted hundreds of thousands of euros in pointless wiretapping. We'll let our work speak for itself, as I said before. Thanks. - They say she's crazy. - No, I don't believe that. Hey, I'm coming, five minutes. Gentlemen, I'm so happy you came. Thank you for coming. Thank you so much... BERGAMO, APRIL 2013 ONE MONTH TO THE CASE FILING Here, this is the last one. Thank you. What, are you playing with figurines? More like Battleships, actually. Except it's me being hit and sunk in this case. Why do you say that? Senator Nigiotti is on the warpath, clearly. The Judges' Council wants to open an inquiry into my investigation. And on top of that, Gorno's mayor claims that I've tarnished the reputation of his town. How about the D.A.? What's he saying? In order to avoid being sanctioned by the Judges' Council... ...they'd like me to volunteer to be transferred immediately. They never believed the Unknown 1 theory. They just think I made it all up because it didn't lead to anything, sadly. And Guerinoni, how far did you get with that? Well, we interviewed everyone, uh, colleagues, relatives, friends, but no one said anything about this extramarital affair. - Mum's the word, and they say omertà... - ...is only a thing in the South. - Here, ma'am. These are the last ones. - Ah. - There you go. - All right, more useless paper. Taxpayer's money thrown out the window. At least it's all over now. Here you go, anonymous letters, clairvoyants, mediums, mythomaniacs, various felonies that we came across in the wiretaps. Oh, and of course, we have the satanic lead. You gotta have that. Ma'am, I don't understand you. This way you'll be able to assist whoever's replacing me. Why are you saying that? I'm just saying it as it is. Prosecutor Ruggeri failed. She's an idiot. Someone else will take care of this. Provided they can find anything, because we're running out of time. Soon the case will be filed. You know, my grandfather used to tell me a story that I liked a lot. Three moths were wondering about the nature of a candle. The first said, "Light." The second said, "Fire," and the third one went out to check, but it never returned because it burned itself. Because you see, ma'am, the truth can never be known. I appreciate it, Marshal, but I don't see how this story can be of any help. Just prove it wrong. Try and turn these ancient stories around. I'm sure if anyone can do it, it's you. Don't resign, ma'am. Let them kick you out rather. I'd love to see if they have the guts to do it. - Raise your arms. - Yes. Good. I'm sorry, uh, Prosecutor Ruggeri's office? Yes, cross the courtyard, you'll find an elevator, second floor. - Thank you. - Of course. Come through. So, Professor Previdere, help me understand. Yes, I'll explain. And you sent your samples to us as well. Well, yes, I sent them to half of Italy. Right, but... One of my researchers, okay, Pierangela Grignani, who, by the way... ...undeterred by the fact that her grant has expired, keeps coming to the laboratory anyway, and has made an interesting discovery. There. It's about one allele found in Unknown 1's DNA. An... an allele? Yes, an allele is a variant of a gene. Miss Grignani did an in-depth analysis of Unknown 1's nuclear DNA, and she discovered this variant which is not at all common among people here. And it's not found in his father Giuseppe's profile, which, therefore, means he's got it from his mother. No, I'm sorry, let me try to understand. You... You didn't look for this allele before, is that right? No, because the variants are countless, but now, we can search much more rapidly through all the collected DNA samples and compare them. Do you understand? And it was this girl who found it? After running out of funding? This is Italy, Miss Ruggeri. We got the results from Professor Previdere. And? The laboratory compared the genetic profile of several women. One of them, for all the 21 autosomal markers, shares the same allele found in Unknown 1. She's his mother. Yes. It's a 99.99% match. - We've found her. - We got her, Letizia. Three weeks before the case filing. This is the mother. Esther Arzuffi, married to Mr. Bossetti. She has three children. The youngest one has been living abroad for several years. There's two twins. One is a female, the other one is Massimo Giuseppe Bossetti. Forty-one, resident of Mapello, carpenter. That explains the iron particles on Yara's clothes and the lime residue in her lungs. Did you notice his second name is Giuseppe, like Mr. Guerinoni? Mrs. Arzuffi named him after his real father. And according to the forensics, based on his genetic profile, there's a 90% chance he has light eyes, like Massimo Bossetti. - We've already put him under observation. - But let's be careful. Because if he is Unknown 1, he's been watching his back for four years. We're checking the phone records, to see where he was on November 26th, 2010. Meanwhile, we'll be bugging his place. If it's him, this time he has no escape. Are you here to read the meter? - Perfect. - May I? Please come in. I'll show you the way. Can you close the door? - Okay. - Thank you. All right. So, the meter's here. Everything, actually, seems to be working fine. Okay, let's just check. - Okay, so I'll leave you to it. - Okay. - If you need anything, I'm inside. - Okay, thanks. BEAUTY SALON TANNING SHOP According to the experts, Mr. Guerinoni is the biological father of the man who left his biological mark on Yara's underwear and leggings. According to the detectives, Guerinoni's son... I think this time they'll catch the monster. What a bastard. ...Ruggeri has worked so hard for. This DNA result is potentially a lead to finding the murderer of the 13-year-old gymnast from Brembate Sopra. Today a new piece has been added to the puzzle of... Okay, I'm going to bed. What about you? No, I'll stay here for a little longer. I still have stuff to do. But it's really late. What do you have to do? Uh, nothing, really, come on. When you come up, make sure you don't wake the kids. Okay? Of course. Bend. Stretch. Open. Close. Bend. Stretch. Plié. Change. Up. Plié. Change. Action. Lean. Up. Wait one moment. They can do better. - Excuse me. One moment. - Once more. Seven, eight... Ma'am, I'm sorry to bother you. It's Garro. Yes, yes, Garro, I could tell from your number. - Yeah, of course. - Tell me. I just wanted to inform you that we have Mr. Bossetti's phone records. On that Friday, at 5:45 p.m., his phone pinged off the Brembate tower, corresponding to the sports center. Then his phone was turned off until seven the morning after. Hello, ma'am, did you hear what I just said? Yes, yes. I heard. I heard. Thank you. Great job. Of course. By for now, Marshal. Good morning. License and registration, please. It's just a routine check. We need to do an alcohol test. Please blow in here. There. Slowly. - Do you mind if I wait in my car? - No, no. You can wait in the car. We have the DNA test. Bossetti is Unknown 1. It's a 100% match. - Here is the arrest warrant. - Well. Premeditated murder, aggravated cruelty. If we don't hurry up, the press we'll get there first. Ah. Okay, let's hurry up. Make sure he doesn't run that way, okay? - Let's go. Get your men over there. - Watch out. He'll run there. That way. Maura. We have made an arrest. His name is Massimo Bossetti. What? Boss... Bossetti? Um, I don't know him. Never heard that name. He's a builder from Mapello. He works at the same sites where your husband works. Perhaps he knew you, and he knew about Yara. Perhaps he offered her a lift. Maura. Are you alone? Is your husband there with you? No, I'm fine. I'm fine. But, um, are you sure? It's his DNA, 100%. I'm only sorry you had to wait all this time. But why did he do it? I mean, who is this guy? One step at a time, we'll get all the answers. My client is invoking his right to remain silent. It's his right to do so. This alleged "queen proof," the DNA that would allegedly frame Mr. Bossetti, is inherently flawed, lacks the mitochondrial element. It should be considered void. The procedure they followed is unacceptable. As long as we care to live under the rule of law, and not in a police state. The trial resumes today at the Bergamo Grand Jury Court, Question is, will we finally get to know the truth? Is Mr. Bossetti guilty or not? These are the questions the public have been asking for four years, and that perhaps will finally be answered. Unfortunately, we have no footage to show. The court, presided by Judge Bertoja, after a few incidents with the public, has decided to hold the trial behind closed doors. Only a few accredited journalists and the closest relatives will be allowed to attend. When the police agents arrived at your workplace to arrest you, why were you frightened? They suddenly showed up and treated me like some kind of... ...some kind of drug dealer. I don't know, they gave me no explanation, nothing. I've actually been wondering what the reason is from the first day I was arrested, you know. Why on earth did I get caught up in this? Since I didn't do anything, as you all know. No, Mr. Bossetti. We are convinced otherwise. If you're here it's because of serious evidence that we have against you, and also because a judge considered the judicial framework sufficient to take you to trial and prosecute you. Show me the real evidence that you have, then. So you're saying, sir, that you can't tell us the reason why your DNA was found on this girl's clothes. Absolutely not. I've told you already, my tools were stolen. It must have ended up there because the... ...the robber killed her. Well, let me just remind you that your DNA was also found on the girl's underwear. And consequently, it can't have been transferred there by a work tool. Your Honor, I object to the question. Is the prosecutor interrogating the defendant, or surreptitiously introducing her own conclusion? Prosecutor Ruggeri, please rephrase your question. On May 29th, 2014, you were not at the building site. You were at home. Do you remember what you did that morning? I can't remember if on the 29th of May 2014 I was home, but... I'll help you. At 9:55 a.m., our analysts, not just one but four of our consultants, found this search on your computer, "girls with shaved vaginas." I don't... I don't know. I have no idea. I'm assuming my wife did that search. Sometimes we would do it together. That time, it must have been her. That's not a crime, is it? No, no. It's not, actually. But you, Mr. Bossetti, at 9:46 a.m. were at home because you called Mr. Andreoli, pinging a cell tower in Terno d'Isola, Carbonera Street, and then, at 9:55 a.m., that is nine minutes after the end of the conversation, we find this search, "girls with shaved vaginas." How can you possibly tell that I was home from my cell phone? You're telling me I was home from my cell phone? Yes. At 9:46 you were at home, Mr. Bossetti, because your cell phone, in fact, pinged off a cell tower corresponding to your house. Your Honor, I object to the question. I don't understand what these forays into the defendant's privacy have to do with the murder in question. Overruled, Mr. Salvagni. Prosecutor, you may continue. Your wife, on the other hand, was away from the house because at 11:19 a.m., she sent a message to you and to a class president at your children's school, actually pinging a cell tower many miles away from your house. There you go. Clearly stated in black and white. A short while later, your wife called you up, still far away, this time latching on to the Ponte San Pietro cell tower. She told us she went to the hairdresser, and her testimony actually checks out. Therefore, that online search, Mr. Bossetti, was done by you and by you alone. Absolutely not. I couldn't have done a computer search like that. I don't know how to use it. You don't know how to do a Google search? Look, I can do it, and I'm completely useless at IT. I know you don't believe me. No one believes you, Mr. Bossetti, not just me. We do. You're the only one who doesn't. Oh, I'm sorry. Your defense lawyers believe you. No. A lot of other people do too. Colonel Vitale, we saw this video, which was broadcast thousands of times. It turns out only one of those vans is, in fact, Bossetti's. It's not just one, Mr. Salvagni. Colonel, adding a screenshot of Bossetti's van to other vans is like adding pears to bananas. This video was approved by the D.A.'s Office to satisfy the pressing needs to clarify the circumstances that had emerged. What do you mean by that, Colonel? That is was created for communication purposes. Those images were put together by my office not to prove a thesis but to provide a meaningful illustration of our hypotheses. Here it is, ladies and gentlemen, the video. Objection, Your Honor. This video is not included in the report we submitted. So? So, it cannot be shown in this court because it's not included in the file. Well, you made it. It's your document. With the excuse to illustrate your theory, the press took it at face value and circulated it as if it were true. That's why it hasn't been filed. Uh, Your Honor, the defense ask that the whole video that was sent to the press to be made available to the court. If it's not included in the forensics report, we are not at all interested. Your Honor, this blunder will go down in the history of jurisprudence. The video was made by splicing images of generic Iveco vans for media purposes. It is outrageous! It's a total disgrace! It disgusts me just to think about it. Mr. Salvagni, that's enough. Please conclude. I've already concluded. Was it your brother-in-law that time too? We all said what we did on the 26th. You didn't. You never said what you did that evening. And you came home late. Well, not really late. But late, still. And you never told me what you did. Mari, who could remember that? How can I remember a regular day in my life when nothing happened at all? What do you mean by that? You don't believe me either? JUNE 2016 LAST DAYS OF HEARING On that night, Mr. Bossetti forced or persuaded the girl, whom he had already seen around Brembate, to get into his van. Then he plausibly tried to sexually assault her, and Yara defended herself with the little strength she had. Because, although she was an athlete, and although she was into sports, she was nevertheless a 13-year-old child. - None of this is true. - It's okay, stay calm. Quiet, please, or I'll be forced to expel the defendant. Prosecutor Ruggeri, please continue. He dragged her through that field, knowing perfectly well that no one would find her there. He stunned her with a blunt object, and once unconscious, he inflicted those wounds and left her there to die, to freeze to death. All the injuries were inflicted while she was still alive. Cuts that were not sufficiently deep to cause her to die but not superficial either. One nicked her carotid artery, one nicked her trachea. She must have had trouble breathing, and in the meantime, she was bleeding. She was lying there, alone, in the dark. She must have been scared. She must have been in pain, in a gloomy, unknown, freezing cold location. Professor Previdere, from the University of Pavia, the geneticist who identified the perfect match between the DNA of Unknown 1 and Massimo Bossetti, gave us a very clear and precise example. Given that on Earth there are seven billion people, it would take as many as 330 million billion worlds like ours in order to find another person with the same DNA characteristics. The analysis yielded numerous iron particles on Yara's clothes, in sizes ranging from one to thirty microns. These particles are usually found on sites where iron materials are produced. So then we checked all the seats in Massimo Bossetti's van one by one, and we found that on the backrest and the cushions of all three passenger seats, there were numerous such particles in all six samples. The aggravating circumstances are, the use of torture and cruel acts on an unarmed and defenseless victim, exploitation of time factors, having acted under the cover of darkness, of a place, having acted in an isolated field, and of a person, this being, evidently, a grown-up man attacking a 13-year-old teenager, the very fact of which would impede her ability to defend herself. For all these reasons, Your Honor, we request a sentence of life in prison, with six months in isolation. Order! Order, please! Order in the court! Order in the court! Be quiet. Order! Order! All rise. WE ARE ALL EQUAL BEFORE THE LAW "Today, July 1st, 2016, in the name of the Italian people, the Grand Jury of Bergamo, in accordance with the articles 533 and 535 of the Penal Code, declares the defendant Massimo Bossetti guilty of the aggravated murder of Yara Gambirasio and sentences him to life imprisonment." The Court is adjourned. July 17th, 2017, the Court of Appeal confirms the guilty verdict. October 12th, 2018, the Supreme Court confirms Massimo Bossetti's guilty verdict. Despite the rulings, Massimo Bossetti never ceased to proclaim his innocence. November 2019, Bossetti's defense requests access to the findings for new evaluations, but the motion is rejected. January 11th, 2021, the Supreme Court orders the Assize Court of Bergamo to schedule a hearing to analyze the findings. June 3rd, 2021, the Assize Court of Bergamo rejects Bossetti's defense request to access the findings. Subtitle translation by: Angelica Lacetera
