The following story is based on a real event. The shocking discovery on 16/08/1996... ...near the Swiss border, which was made public by the press. The victims, Nadine D. and Sebastian K. ... ...were ready to travel to Italy, when they were reported missing. And were found brutally murdered and horribly mutilated. The bodies were discovered at an abandoned sadomasochist club... ...according to information from authorities. Obviously the place had been used for years to commit depraved murders... ...based on the discovery of multiply bodies... ...and the discovery of different DNA samples. The identity of the murderers is unknown... ...they are still free. This film is based on real information... ...as was contained in the original documents. Out of respect for the victims and their relatives... ...the names have been altered. Are you recording... - I'm recording, darling. - Hello. Hey! It's a good day. - Yes a good day. - Hello. We're doing fine. Very good. - Yes good. - Yes, I'm intrigued. - Let's go down. - It should be down here. There are a lot of steps. - Turn off the fucking camera. - No one needs to see this. Turn the fucking camera off. Only a few steps left. - Only two, two, two. - And one more, and now... Jump. One, two... Well... Where are the lockers? Already tired. You can rest a bit. Wait, mine. Shit, too fast. - Don't swear, I'm filming you. - Ah, okay. - To drink and stuff. - My bag... - Yours? - Yes please. - No problem. - Well... That's it then? What now... - I'm waiting. - Central Station Parking Get lost with the fucking camera. It's starting to annoy me. Isn't it getting heavy? - After I film you a bit more... - So you like our little town? - You can say that. - I feel exactly the same. Come on, don't start. You'd really like it. Well... ...our flight leaves at 6 tonight. And we have...some time... ...to get from here to the airport... ...and still have an hour to do something. Well we have 2 hours then. - All clear. - So let's not waste anymore time! Come on, darling. Simon... She didn't go blind yesterday. I know... But I worry about it. You don't need to. You know it, I know it for a long time and she carries herself well. But she might not enjoy the trip much. Why not? Because she can't see anything. Maybe she sees it otherwise. Yeah, maybe... If it's a problem for you... ...even though you asked her on the trip. My God, Simon! What do you think? It's beautiful. Really? Yes, it's great. I wish she could see it. You find a problem in everything don't you. No that's not true. But I can't let it go. No? No... It's my heart talking... When she looks at me with those eyes I know she can never see my face. You understand what I mean? Ah, Simon... Hey, we're over here! Careful, careful... I feel like I traveled around the world. Come closer... Sorry to bug you lovebirds, but you can continue later... ...in the bedroom or in the plane, or... ...the bus, in the pool or sea, or the bar... Get to the point! Well... What do we do? I propose the cathedral. The cathedral? - Yes, the cathedral.- The cathedral? - Yes, the cathedral.- Are you serious? Well let's hear your idea... Well since I heard yours... Come on your only thinking about going shopping. Wait...I have something... A guide to Frankfurt. I have another one too... So you have an evil idea? Of course. Incredible... It's incredible. - Wait. We do we have here. - We've arrived... Where are we, you ask?- A museum for the blind... - Come on are you serious? - Interesting... - A museum for the blind? - Of course. - Please baby, I want to go. - If you both want to... Cool, I see absolutely nothing. - Come on, it's right in front of you. - What was that? - A fork? - Guys this is impossible. We.. Shit! This is making me panic and... Damn this... Hey wait up! What? Whats wrong? - You have something... - Damn! - Wait. - Here... Hi mom... How are you feeling? We just got to Frankfurt. Or we going to get something to eat? No leave me alone... We went to a museum for the blind. We would have been better off going to see a movie. Simon! Sorry... Yes, you too. Bye, yes, goodbye. My mom says hi. - Thank you. - Well, now that Simon is clean we can get him out of here. You wouldn't understand, darling. Anyway, it's just a joke. OK... God bless the souls of this city. Amen. - Amen. - Relax, dude. What do you say? It's a weirdo... I can help? I'd say yes. You'd say. Loan me these sweets for one hour. Repeat that! - Let go! It's not worth it. - A tough guy. I'm willing to forget the girls... ...in exchange for a donation. Are you crazy... Thank you pretty lady... Have a great day! Why did you give that guy 20 Euros... Did you want to wait for him to kill us? What are you saying? Kill us? With a piece of gum? You are so naive? Naive? Stupid, I lost it when he reached into his jacket. Oh! - Calm down the two, okay? - Come on Nina, let's go. Now I'm the bad guy? Screw you! Fuck you! Just forget it. What will you do? What do you think? We said no. - What is it? - Your loved one wants to go into a seedy gambling den. No matter, what it is, I'm very tired. But... - No buts! - 2 votes to 1. You lost. Come on. Come on. Careful of the stairs. This place is dead. Anyway, let's get something to drink. Go on get her... Would you like to have a seat? I would rather go. What is it? I think we are in some kind of fetish club... What? Sit. We want something, we'll stay for 5 minutes... ...we're out without attracting attention, right? I think we should leave. What would you like? Hi... I'll have a coke. Just a small, please. I want a bit of fun? Gorgeous... No, it is still too early. The night is young. Exactly. And for you? I'll also have a Coke, thanks. I would say that he likes blondes... Shut up... Hello everybody... Hi... I've never seen you around here before. We are not from here. Really? Far from your home? We live 2 hours away. Who is it? Darling, it's a waitress. You seem like a nice trio out for adventure. Right. He does not realize that this bothering you? Yes? What are you doing? Open your eyes, darling. She's blind! Darling! It is the perfect prerequisite for a career in my profession. So you don't have to see those ugly penises. Just enjoy them. Or else, you've lost your sense? That's what you think! Fucking bitch! What did you call me? She's just joking... I said, you fucking bitch! You know, you just need someone to talk so... ...you can see it. It's not necessary, her sense of smell works perfectly! Leave it now... Who are you? The ass kisser? No slut, I'm your friend. There are friends among foxes? Don't touch them... Damn lesbian bitch! You should... ...try it. So you could release your sentiments. Really? Then you should do it, right? You should do it, sure. Mom... Okay, we don't need to fight. I hate people like you... ...that don't respect anyone, they have such shitty lives. What the hell do you want from me? We're leaving now! Come on! 10 euros, that's enough. Actually, my services cost more than 10 euro. But for you...it's free. We like to look after tourism. - Come on, let's go. - Now I'm the teacher. Come in... Mom... Yeah... Everything is ready. OK. When...? - Do you have it all? - Yeah... Give it to me... That's it? No, their bags are downstairs... ...they also had these. Airplane tickets... You think we can use them? We could try. - Then I will try tomorrow. - Now you can go! Dominique? Yes, mom... These three are not only for fun... ...in these times we must seize every penny. Sure, Mom. Well, the blind one gets the rat room. Take him, to the slaughterhouse... ...and the loudmouth to the operating room. That'll do, mama. And tell Angelique that we have a live show. I will. Close the door! To my health! Hello... Hello... CAT AND MOUSE Hello... Hello... Hello... Let go! What? What is it? Let me go. I want to get out of here! I want to go. Please! Leave me! You're the one who treated my girls like filthy scum... ...isn't that, right? How can you judge people... by their desires... ...and how they act according to their inclinations? I mean, I don't judge you by your way of having sex. Your sexual and masturbatory habits, I don't share at all. Am I concerned? No. I get aggressive? No! Many times... I have heard people like you... ...talking so much of the same, riff-raff. Whispering behind my back because I live by my instincts. Showing what I have inside me. Even people like me... ...enjoy more and more sex. Secretly of course... ...and among our own kind. Disappearing and hiding behind the mask of Lugones. Yes. Have no fear, no fear. I just want to steal you, into my world! A world of your own dreams, your own fantasies. Where you, you can be you. Show you how you really are. You can not imagine the things that have happened in my house. It was quite an ordeal... But do I judge?... No. I offer! I offer all those poor souls that have demands inside themselves. And to achieve those feelings you will pay any price. Are you paying attention? Silence! Listen, listen! If you do not shut up I shall dig into your eye. Would you like that? I can't hear you. It takes awhile to complete the program... ...until the right question is asked. Do you understand what I mean? Good. You know what to expect then. Hello! Nina! Dodo! Shit! Damn! Who are you? - And stop. - Hold it right there? All controlled, eh? - What? - How cool is that? How lucky you are. I will give you your own death. What do you want from me? Simon, Simon, Simon ... How do you know my name? I forgot how I know. But, ah ... I remember. I read it on a plastic card in your wallet... ...used to identify you. Why... That thing is useful? - What? - The plastic card you will no longer be needing is useful and I can use it to cut off your balls. No. Agreed. Simon, now you have to be strong, okay? I have some very bad news for you. Here... ...in the House of La Petite Mort There is no one responsible for this. Our audience comes from good families. I haven't done anything. You didn't, you're right. But I will do something to you. How can you laugh, you bitches? Damn! Simon? Simon! - Yes! Yes! - I have prepared a surprise for you. Very, very realistic. We'll take this thing and chop it off! But don't worry, because you don't have to look. Help! Help! - Could you give a smile, at least? - You will give it to us? Yes? - Yes... - Please stop crying. Look at me ... ...and stop crying. Simon. Simon, will you look at me now? Yes? - Yes... - You will stop crying? - Yes... - Very good. This is the last time. Do you have any desires? Let's see. Mom? I know what you want. And now I can give it to you. Although mother doesn't understand. But today is your big day. You'll see. Hurry. Yes! Quick! Very good. Dominique ... Dominique! Stand back, honey. Are you happy? - Yes, Mom. - How much? - Very much, Mom. - What do you give your mom? - A kiss. - Thanks, honey. She is my angel. Isn't it pitiful? Without this, they are nothing. That's all that's useful. Enjoy the show. Mom! What is it, dear? - Mr. Breittenau. - Lord Breittenau, greetings. Yes. Yes, that is still available. OK. Would be 10 million, plus 5 million for getting rid of the body. Then I'll prepare the room. Yes, yes, of course, of course. My limo will pick you up and we will meet at 8. Mr. Breittnau, I'm glad. See you later. Angelique and you will take care of the preparations, including the bathroom. Later you will decorate the slaughter house. Mr. Breittnau he wants romance. We'll fix that. - Okay. - I'll take care of the programming. Come on! You have to eat! You've had a hard night. Fuck you! You expect me to eat your disgusting soup? It is the wish of mother. Where is this mom that gives this to me! Mom is working. She is the lady of the house and we will serve. Are you listening? You sick freaks! Do we have to put up with all this because you are horny? Mom said to eat this! Mom said to eat this! Mom said to eat this! Mom said to eat this! Mom said to eat this! Fucking soup lover! Whore! Damn bitch! I will kill you and your mother! You can be sure it! I swear! Really? - Whore! - But that's ... ...very, very terrible. The Dodo wants to kill us. The Dodo wants to kill us. The Dodo wants to kill us.... The Dodo wants to kill us. The Dodo wants to kill us. The Dodo wants to kill us. Is that... ...your death threat? Little monkey. Damn bitch! Tell me. How does it feel... ...living in the dark? Without seeing your surroundings. And what people look like. Please. Please help me. It's not me who makes the decisions. But... ...could you help me. Fo years I've not made decisions. But I didn't do anything to anyone! I almost feel sorry... ...but the deal is done. Why? Why us? Like me. Wrong time and in the wrong place. In the wrong fucking place. I want to go home to my mother. Please! Please don't let them kill me. Fear not... ...they just want to satisfy their desires. And now your friend will get what she deserves. How are your parents? - Dominique. - we will finish... ...what we started. I expected something more elegant. Whatever, shut your mouth! Mr. Breittenau... I'm so happy. Did you have a good trip? Hello, how are you? - Hello. - Okay, how about you? - Okay. - Sorry but I have to leave. - Coffee? Champagne? - I have to hurry, bye. - Then next time, goodbye. - I'm happy. Everything is ready... Dish of the Day Are you recording, young man? - Yes. - Yes, what? - Yes, Mom. - Then you can start the show. The master Kubolt has had a vision. It'll be a blond actress... ...as a blonde. And her... ...blind friend. Yes, I can clarify it. That's good. The master wants his desire. Right away. The master Kubolt wants the... ...girl to eat herself. The blood of life ... ...and its delights. It's over. Stop, it's over. Your choice master Kubolt. So be it. And what do we with her? First, try to kill without making her suffer. Side dishes Seriously. How would you imagine me? I think it would be. As young man. And in the beginning we just wanted money. To have a nice life... ...without hardship or concerns. To have the best possible life. Perhaps the life of a pop star. Or maybe a model? How many girls don't dream of that? Not as many as you think. Keep it in your mouth. And bite down tenderly. And obviously other things are filtered into your sleep. And yes! It is different than expected. Time is short. What a waste, so much talent, so young. I'm a pig! Dessert Quiet, I can be gentle. Do you think they feel that way the girls who are locked in basements? When they receive visits from time to time? Yes - I... - I envied him. Who? A man. What man? - The one with the girl I want. - Do you want to have a girl? - Yes. - What girl? - It's not a girl. - A woman? - Yes. - Yes, it is the precious and beautiful wife of my eldest son. But she's married to your son. For a short time. You can have me. No. Why not? - I don't like necrophilia. - I'm still alive. Son of a bitch, you wanted to kill me. What is going on? - She killed him! - And the she's gone. Are you serious? That bastard still hasn't paid the bill and the whore has also disappeared? Is that so? Yes? What would you recommend to the idiot you see in the mirror? Look in the mirror. Listen, Angelique and you... ...go get the whore. And if you don't, you'll be next. Do you understand? Out! - Yes, Mom. - This is not happening. Dodo... Dodo, where are you? Don't be afraid. Come on little monkey. Don't be... Are you ready little monkey? The bodies were found two years later in a forest in the Czech Republic. The clues lead to a fetish club far from the location of the bodies. When police found the location they couldn't find anything to incriminate the guilty. Until this day they are still missing and are probably abroad. HOWEVER TODAY IS A NEW DAY!
