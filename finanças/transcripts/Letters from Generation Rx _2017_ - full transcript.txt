[wind blowing] [slow atmospheric singing] I've had to renegotiate that memory over and over and over again. Gravel spitting and water flying and kids screaming. It was the summer after I turned eight. We never really knew what to expect from mum. During a particularly bad swing, she went through some really desperate days there and she put us all in the Bronco and took us for a drive down to the river. Before we got to the river, she was just purely robotic. She decided it was time for all of us... to die. It's time to die; we re all gonna feel better soon; "we'll all feel better soon, "we re all gonna feel better soon" My memories of that moment are really in black and white. I'm not sure I ever really met my mum again after that point. [slow guttural singing] - A strange story out of Florida this morning, where the mother of three children drove into the ocean off of Daytona Beach. The pregnant mum spoke of demons before driving into the Atlantic... Police say they've never seen anything like this... The tiny city of Newburgh New York is trying to come to grips with the deaths of 3 young children who died when their mother drove them into the Hudson River. We are talking about a tragedy in this city that I would say is probably second-to-none. - It all unfolded at this boat ramp Tuesday evening. - Any effort to locate the vehicle, difficult at best, it was not floating, it was underwater. - Among the victims are 2-year old Lance Pierre and his 11-month old sister. - Perhaps we should take nothing for granted: not our loves, nor our lives, our families or friends, even our sanity. One minute, all is well, the next, we re plunged into darkness, unable to process what is real, and what is madness. Autumn Stringham realized this all-too-young. - It was the summer after I turned eight. - She should not be alive, and she knows it. - That was the moment that shattered trust. How do you... You know, how do you trust anybody after that? - Forced to confront a mystery beyond her comprehension, she spent decades haunted, in search of answers, in pursuit of peace. When something like killing all six of her children made sense enough to put the kids in the Bronco and drive into the river... I see it. Gravel spitting and water flying and kids screaming. Somehow she managed to dig it up to back out of that. And that's an incredible victory for somebody in that state of mind. You know, there are other mothers who don't win that battle. - In exchange for this redemption, there was a price, however. And it's taken me thirty years to, um... to be able to find the... the beautiful side of that memory. - Autumn's mum did eventually die by suicide, alone on a country road. Tony Stephan was now widowed with eight children at home. - I'm laying in bed at night in my room listening to a house full of mourning; and it just shattered the whole family. It just shattered the children, it shattered me. - It has become so commonplace, these irrational acts and horrific deeds, that we've almost become numb to it. We've seen them in schools and public spaces, in homes and churches. They're all over the news. Try as we might to understand them, we can't. Try as we might to ignore them, they call to us still. We called the paramedics, they tried feverishly to revive her. And I was trying to give her mouth-to-mouth resuscitation but I knew something was wrong because her body was cold. - It's 2004. Andy Downing's world has just been shattered; his daughter, a victim of an unimaginable act of violence. But it was how this 11-year old girl died that truly horrified the world: - Hello, I'm Candace Downing. - Candace... hanged herself. When Candace first died, we asked ourselves, how could we not know that she was unhappy? - The Downings didn't realize it at the time, of course, but her case was not a rare event. No. Candace was far from alone. - She started on this drug somewhere around January. And these things make you unafraid. They make you do things you wouldn't do normally. They make you... able to put a rope around your neck and hang yourself. Caitlin died at home and we found her, and she'd probably had been dead for maybe at the most five minutes when we found her. She'd hanged herself in the guest bedroom upstairs. It really is like a perfect mystery murder novel. I mean, it's almost like killing somebody with an icicle and it melts and the weapon is gone. - They were still dizzy from death, traumatized and broken, when they solved the mystery. The drugs responsible, they say, are called SSRIs and they're among the best-selling drugs in the world. It was a sample pack of Paxil. Cipralex. Sertraline, which is Zoloft. And the maximum dose of Zoloft legally allowed. There was one thing in her system in the coroner's report: a therapeutic dose of Fluoxetine hydrochloride. SSRIs are better known as antidepressants. These are some symptoms of depression. Psychiatric drugs like SSRIs have been defended with religious zeal by their believers and damned by others as some of the most dangerous drugs on the planet. Distinguishing truth from fiction has been a challenge, and this has placed the public in the unenviable position of de-constructing the scientific and medical dogma on their own, in the midst of a 30-year social experiment. As Director of the National Institutes of Mental Health, Thomas Insel has been at the centre of a storm of contradictions about the use of these drugs. I think that we have to be very humble about this right now, because we've often been so self-congratulatory, because we have, after all, many people feel, made great strides. The numbers don't really support that. - Dr. Insel's candour is sure to shock and upset many, on all sides of the debate. The word failure is one few have dared to utter. Fundamentally, why have we failed here? Why has the suicide rate not come down? Why have the measures, disability, whatever those might be, why have those continued to go up instead of down? All of the numbers are going in the wrong direction, so where, where have we failed? What's gone wrong here? - The answers, according to Insel, run contrary to the standard arguments put forth by mental health professionals. - A lot of people say it's because of stigma and access. The fact is that actually more people are getting more treatment than ever before, so it's hard for me to quite believe that. I would just submit that from the NIMH perspective, the answer about why we've failed is a little more disruptive. And that answer is that we don't know enough. - To hear the Director of the NIMH say now that all of the exultations about psychotropics from the media, from academia, from the profession, from governments, were not merited is unsettling. After billions of prescriptions and hundreds of billions of dollars in drug company profits, how did this occur? I think that our field has gone off track here by devoting so much of its resources over the last 20 to 30 years, both publicly and privately, just trying to understand how the drugs work. If the drugs were truly curative, if it was like trying to understand how insulin helps somebody with diabetes, that might be defensible. But you've got medications here that, at most reduce some of the symptoms of mood disorders, of psychotic disorders. They don't, in any sense, provide a cure. This change of heart contradicts what we've been told about psychiatric drugs for a generation now and raises serious questions about how and why these drugs have been dispensed so indiscriminately to millions. - I was massively drugged. I tried drug after drug. I did what they told me to do. I used to take tranquillizers, bezodiazepines, that's all I did was pop pills all day. They just kept handing me pills, you know, here, let's try this, let's try this, let's try this. And I felt like a walking pharmaceutical company, really. And nothing was working. I was drugged out. I was a non-existent person. I mean, I was just... I had a heartbeat and that's really all that I had. I was just sort of given these pills and said, Swallow this. Take that. Chew this. And I was never told: well, you might experience these side-effects, or this actually might not work. It's sort of like they were just was given to me as like a panacea like, This is going to fix your Tourette's. "This is going to fix your OCD. "This is going to fix everything and "everything is going to be all better. Really, as an 8 or 9-year-old, I really believed that, until I began really experiencing all those horrible side-effects and it eventually changed me into not even a person, but like a monster. I was horrible. Doctors, to a large degree, have abandoned their Hippocratic oath, which is to do no harm. And that is, it's like a pill for every ill. They are knee jerk prescribers, many of them. In fact, it has been shown that the average doctor will make a decision to prescribe a drug within 19 seconds of seeing a patient. Using antidepressants, or any of the psychiatric drugs is simply not understood, it's not explained, it's not dwelt upon. I think they're in a different class of drug from most of the drugs we take for our other ailments. - In the 80s and 90s, SSRIs were the first in a class of new mental health potions heralded as wonder drugs and miracle cures. They were extolled as safe and effective solutions for the age-old problem of depression and were marketed as such. Thus began an aggressive march towards a new era in psychiatry, one which boasted chemicals for the mental health conditions that had dogged humankind for millennia. Thirty years later, however, the window on that era, and its bold proclamations, appears to be closing. What are we doing? I mean, especially when it comes to children, we don't really know how the drugs work, we don't know whether they work, we don't know whether they're neurotoxic, and so that means we re all in the middle of a public health experiment that's been going on for the last 50-60 years and more intensively for the last 30 years. My prediction, I don't think I'll live to see it but my prediction is, that some day, we will look back at the antidepressant era and have the view of prescribing antidepressants that now we have of blood-letting. - Irving Kirsch rocked psychiatry with an appearance on 60 Minutes and an explosive book, The Emperor's New Drugs. Three times he tested the data on SSRIs, three times, he verified that prescription antidepressants were no better than taking a sugar pill. Still, he was under fire from critics who vowed to prove him wrong. People started doing other studies. They said, well maybe you did your statistics wrong. Critics, opponents, they took our data an re-did it. The FDA has done its own meta-analysis, looking at all of the antidepressants they've ever approved. And they got the same result. Everybody gets the same result. In the immediate, it could make a huge difference. You could have someone going from being psychotic to being non-psychotic, which is a pretty amazing change in behaviour. But what I think what we need to recognize that's happened over the last 50 years is that they haven't shown to be as good as we thought they were. - Yet, in the case of psychiatric drugs, informed choice is a bit of a misnomer and finding the path of least risk can be daunting. In this vacuum, millions have been harmed, simply due to a lack of knowledge. Psychiatrists knowledge and training in the area of psycho-pharmacology is completely inadequate, in my view. And this is partly because of the focus on the disease-centred model. Psychiatrists have been so obsessed with what disease different drugs treat, they haven't looked at the drugs as drugs, and they haven't understood all the harmful effects the drugs can produce. It's time for us to stop and reflect on this and say, Okay. Where are we at with the use of medications? It serves a purpose, it's got a place, but we need to also stop and recognize that there is a cost to this and that there are people who are struggling for other reasons now because of the side effects associated with these medications. - While the drug companies ruthlessly defended their magic bullets in the Courts and through the Press, they were, in effect, stigmatising people who were harmed by using them. The long lens of history has revealed that the troubling effects of these chemicals were well-known, years before FDA and other regulatory bodies actually approved SSRIs. This is hard for me because I tried to commit suicide in front of my five children. I attacked him with a kitchen knife. I took the 9mm automatic, sat down on the bed and put the gun to my head. After being on Prozac for 21 days, my wife shot and killed both of these two boys right here. Eli Lilly calls Prozac the wonder drug and I wonder why? Thinking back on how this drug affected me, does a wonder drug rob you of a conscience? Does a wonder drug make you forget the difference between right and wrong? In the early 1990's this issue had reached a peak, was Prozac causing violence and suicide? But what happened was that their psycho-pharmacology committee, almost everybody on the committee worked for the drug companies. So the conflicts of interest was so enormous that the FDA had to give them all letters forgiving them of their conflicts of interest so they couldn't be sued. - What about your concern regarding something like Prozac that, very well documented: 28,000 adverse reports, 1600 suicides associated with that drug. Well, drugs that go through our very rigorous testing and review process are very well understood chemicals. And drugs are recognized to have both risks and benefits, that's why they go through a rigorous evaluation, and when those products are put out on the market, we have a good scientific understanding of both the risks and benefits. And that's laid out in very detailed labelling that physicians then use to decide whether to prescribe those products to their patients. Side effects are part of pharmaceuticals, that's recognized, and that's why we re so carefully scientifically. Well, nothing could be further from the truth than the chemical is well understood or that the FDA was careful. Actually, what the FDA was careful about was to consciously cover-up every really dangerous adverse effect of Prozac. - ...was on the list of things we were gonna get into... - Why don't you... turn the camera off so we can talk? - They did nothing, absolutely nothing. Meanwhile, Eli Lilly was busily hiding everything they could about the increased rates of suicidality. It was a matter of how do we cover it up? How do we hide it? At every step of the process, towards approval and marketing thereafter, was designed to hide and mislead the public and physicians about the suicide side effect. Leigh Thompson, the chief scientist at Lilly writes in February 7, 1990, that he had a conversation with Dr. Paul Leber at 6:15 in the morning. Now, think about that. You work for the United States government, the taxpayers of the United States government, and your job is to be my watchdog. Do you think I'm going to call you at 6:15 in the morning? And oh, by the way, if you want to send me something, I've got this special back line over here at the FDA. Send it through back channels, you know, so other people don't get it just feed me this info on the QT. I mean it's extraordinary. - Lilly's own secret files implicate the FDA's Paul Leber, Robert Temple and Thomas Laughren as being complicit in a scheme to whitewash the dark facts about Prozac. There are some very telling documents that show the cosy relationship between FDA officials and Eli Lilly in those early years, in the early 1990s. Lilly employees or Lilly personnel referring to certain members of FDA as our friend in the FDA. they're our defender. They were working hard to get over this suicide issue and they referred to the suicide issue as a public relations problem. - Eli Lilly has been called The House That Prozac Built. Before the drug was introduced, Lilly reported earnings of 600 million dollars annually. Prozac changed Lilly's fortunes, and the company banked at least 21 billion dollars in profits from the drug over the life of their patent. [pop music] - When I say to some people, prescriptions drugs are the fourth leading cause of death in our society, that seems to be the dividing line. There's some people who already know it's true, who have read about it and understand it. Then there's others who think, Oh, that's a myth. That can't be true. They simply can't conceive of that, so they stop listening. - Terence Young is a Member of Parliament in Canada, serving Oakville, Ontario, just outside of Toronto. After a prescription drug caused the death of his daughter Vanessa, he founded an advocacy group, Drug Safety Canada. Vanessa collapsed in front of me. Her heart had stopped, basically as she stood up to go upstairs. When you lose a child your world is upside down. I was thrown into a study of medicine, of medical jargon, of how the health care system works and when it doesn't work. And I didn't ask for it, but it was my way of dealing with the loss of Vanessa. So it was, in a sense, my way of grieving. And, um... It started the day she died. - For five years, Young investigated the practices of the medical and drug industries. And in doing so, he says, he realized how Pharma's influence had permeated every construct of modern society. They find a way to create a financial interest in every institution in our society that we rely on for critical thought. They have money in our universities, in our colleges, in our hospital boards, in the media, and they almost always win. - The loss of his daughter, coupled with the shocking truths he uncovered through his medical research, led him to write Death By Prescription and become one of Canada's most ardent proponents of informed choice. - GlaxoSmithKline just paid the largest fine in the history of the United States related to fraud and criminal acts for a drug company. They paid 3 billion dollars for illegal marketing of Paxil, Wellbutrin, and Avandia, Paxil and Avandia both having been drugs that caused a lot of deaths due to adverse drug reactions. And they paid it in cash. This action constitutes the largest healthcare settlement in United States history. It was in their business plan. Because those three drugs, in the years involved sold 25 billion dollars worth. And the drugs are marked up in the thousands of percent. GSK distributed Paxil with false and misleading labelling. What GSK did was encourage the use of Paxil for children who are dealing with depression, with false messages about safety and effectiveness. This unlawful promotion put children at risk of taking drugs that were unproven to be effective for them, and have been shown to increase the risk of suicide. - These fraudulent practices were locked away for decades, protected by institutions and doctors and the drug companies themselves. Psychiatric and scientific ethics were cast aside in exchange for profits. No one went to jail and real people paid the price. [singing Oh Danny Boy] Brennan wore his heart on his sleeve. He just adored social situations. He loved to sing from a very young age, music was part of our life and part of what he adored. To the point where one of the nicest memories we have, was he was at Peggy's Cove with his aunt Meryl and decided at the gift shop that he would sing Danny Boy to all the senior citizens on the bus tour there and just broke out into song and had his own little audience at Peggy's Cove. [singing Oh Danny Boy] Yeah, what I miss most about Brennan is, he came in, he'd always give me a hug. Hey dad, how're you doing? Give me a hug. I still think to this day he's going to walk through the door. We were driving, not too long ago, Nancy, myself and our other son Hayden, and I looked in the back seat and Hayden was sleeping, and I looked to see if Brennan was there. Just out of habit, to see if he was sleeping too. I saw Brennan walk out of this house, he was very robotic. Brennan, where you going? It's okay mum, I just got to go. Puts on his winter coat. Brennan, it's hot out today. It's okay mum, I just got to go. Puts on his winter hat. I said, Brennan, It's hot out today you won't need that. It's okay mum, I just got to go. And I said, well, I need you here for a minute. No, it's okay mum, I just got to go. And that's all he could say to me, and this was a child who was very articulate, who was so verbose that sometimes you would just say okay, okay, enough, enough already. - Four days prior, Brennan went to the family doctor with a chest cold and inexplicably came home with a sample pack of the antidepressant Cipralex. At the time of his disappearance, he was exhibiting the classic signs of Akathisia. When Brennan went missing I drove the roads for hours just north of here. And I did every side road, every conservation area, every lane way looking for him. One of the things that he didn't have was a great sense of direction. I thought maybe he had gone for a hike in the bush and got turned around and couldn't find his way out, and I went looking for him. that's what was going through my mind the whole time. I let him go out the door and that was the last time I saw him alive. And he bought his rope from a local store and drove to a conservation area, texted us, and then hanged himself. - Before long, other teens across the Canadian province of Ontario were dying, just like Brennan did. For Terence Young, the problem hit close to home again, when friends and constituents faced the same horror he and the McCartneys had. My wife called my son Hart to the phone and we heard him say a few words and he banged the phone down and ran upstairs, obviously quite upset. We went and said, What happened? he said, Sara Carlin hanged herself. And we had met Sara, who was 18 years old, just a few weeks before on our back deck, they were part of the same social group in Oakville. They'd play guitar and sing songs and do karaoke or whatever. [piano and singing] Because of my own research the first thing I thought about when an otherwise healthy young person dies is, Was a prescription drug involved? And of course it was. In fact, there is no doubt in my mind that Paxil and withdrawing from Paxil was the cause of Sara Carlin's demise, her suicide. She started on this drug somewhere around January. And these things make you unafraid. They make you do things you wouldn't do normally. They make you... able to put a rope around your neck and hang yourself. A young woman hanging herself is an extremely rare thing to happen. She went home one Saturday night at two o'clock in the morning, took off her make-up and hanged herself in her parents basement. I reached out to Terence at one point because I was in contact with the Coroner's office. I was starting to put the pieces together. It wasn't until after Sara's death that we actually started to connect the dots. We're bereaved fathers, we have a great connection and with Terence's help, we got the inquest. The doctors wouldn't talk to us after. We fought hard for an inquest because we needed to understand, and after Sara had died, then we started doing research on the drug. that's when we really found out about the drug. that's the first time that we realized that Paxil, one of the side effects was suicidal thinking. Everyone told us it's not going to happen, you'll never get an inquest on a prescription drug. So it goes to show you what a couple of Dads can do. I worked with Sara's dad, Neil. We pushed very hard to get an inquest. Um, I asked as Chair of Drug Safety Canada to be party to that inquest and I was turned down. But the coroner did allow me to be an expert witness on drug communications, which I did. There's a videotape of the coroner's counsel saying on the very first day of the inquest, We will show that Paxil did not "play a part in Sara Carlin's death. Well, the whole point of the inquest was to see whether or not antidepressants played a part in Sara's death! The courts acknowledge that this medication can increase thoughts of suicide in particular patients, but they don't think the medication played a role in Sara Carlin's death. - The Coroner in Ontario resisted every request by the Carlin's to get the truth about the death of their daughter. But the Carlin's were willing to risk everything to get it. We basically mortgaged our home to the hilt to try and get some answers, but to me, it was worth it to have that doctor up on the stand and the lawyer asked him, Did you tell Sara that Paxil might cause her to want to kill herself? And he said, No, I didn't. Why didn't you tell her that? Well because, he said, she wouldn't have taken it. Did you tell her parents? "No." "Did you tell anybody? No. Coroners see the suicides; investigate the suicides. Coroners don't want to do anything. Coroners are medical doctors. The coroners are the first line of defence for the industry. - And at the inquest, the odds were stacked against the Carlins. - The jury, I think, was very courageous. But they were specifically instructed by the coroner that they couldn't actually find Paxil as a cause. - The jury made 12 key recommendations, these were detailed recommendations to prevent similar deaths, six of them were aimed at the drug industry and the drug company. So if they didn't think that Paxil caused or played a critical role in Sara Carlin's death, they certainly wouldn't have put six recommendations aimed at the pharmaceutical industry in their decision. It took me a year to get the strength to write to the Chief Coroner. I said, you know, It came to my attention that "you, in fact, had the cause of death changed. I said, how can the coroner's office "have such a lack of transparency? I received a letter back basically telling me that it was criminal offence to meddle with the jury. And if I didn't stop meddling I would be charged and put in jail. I believe where we are right now, those of us who understand the true risks and have been trying to warn others and make change, we're at the bleeding edge. Not the leading edge, because the leading edge hasn't even started yet. We're at the bleeding edge, we're the ones they think we sort of lost it. I know drug reps have been telling people in Ontario for years, oh this poor guy lost his daughter, "he's lost his mind, he's exaggerating stuff. Then there's others that realize I'm not exaggerating. In fact, the evidence backs it up. My book has 200 footnotes. It's totally evidence based. I've never been challenged. I've never been threatened with a lawsuit. The hurdle is trying to get people to believe something that's so unbelievable. - Our mission, per Se, is to be vocal about this, because if It saves one life, then it's all worth it. As much as it, um, every time we talk about it, it re-traumatizes us, makes us relive the experience. But it is what Brennan would have wanted us to do. [music - Danny Boy] - Were you 240lbs of fury? Oh Goodness, yes. And I was not easy to deal with. My son Joseph at that time was 15 years of age. Extremely ill. - Like, it didn't matter what it was. - Very very violent. - The drop of a pin would set me off. - You could actually say he would be everything a school yard shooting is made out of. [phone rings] 911, where's your emergency? He was diagnosed with bipolar effective disorder one. In the years after Debbie Stephan drove the family's 1990 Bronco into a raging river with her children inside, the mental states of both Autumn Stringham and her brother Joseph Stephan deteriorated. - They didn't understand what their Mother was going through, that would take her to that point that she would be prepared to remove herself from this life, and all of the children with her. - Whether the cause was genetics or sheer trauma, they both were diagnosed with bipolar disorder, just like their mum. I was very very down. You begin to lose hope because there's no joy in life at all. There's no happiness to be found. And that was the state of our family. - Joseph, in particular, seemed headed for disaster. He was just a sweetheart, but, boy, when he hit puberty, he really went over, and became incredibly manic and incredibly violent in his mania. He was scary. My dad was scared. Joseph was medicated with lithium. I believe he was taking 750 milligrams of lithium and he was up to 900 milligrams of lithium for a period of time to try and control it. Was I having huge mood swings? Yeah, that stuff definitely started, I mean, I'd been through a lot of pain with the death of my mother and various events that happened in my life. After my mother had committed suicide, uh, I was the most violent person that I knew of. I used to wander the streets at night and I'd go pick fights with the local people and I had this aluminium bat I'd found and I beat it against the curb so it was just jagged and torn up, and, you know, that was my weapon of choice. And, I mean, I'm lucky I never touched anybody with that thing, but that's where it was headed. I mean, it wouldn't have been very long before something actually happened. - My children were already saying to me, Come on dad. "You've got to get him out of the house. "he's going to kill somebody. "You've got to do something, Dad. It didn't matter what we threw at this situation, it wasn't going to get better and I'm going to lose him to a suicide, or he's going to have to be institutionalized. - A thousand miles away, Autumn was also struggling desperately. Now married with a child, she, too, was caught in the grip of her mother's madness. - At that point in my life, I just felt like everything was ashes. You know, I'd just lost my mum to suicide. My diagnosis had been upgraded, so now I was rapid-cycling bipolar one with schizophrenic tendencies, which was, it seemed really dark, like I wasn't going to get over that. And so I had actually planned to commit suicide. With one child ingesting a five-drug cocktail and contemplating suicide and the other engulfed by violent thoughts, Tony Stephan's family was under siege. My daughter at the same time had been in and out of the psych ward, struggling with the same issues as her mother and her brother and was on five different medications. She had been through major medication changes. It wasn't working. At the very, very best, it wasn't working. So, I was left in a terrible state, a terrible state where I had to find an answer, because you see, my family was literally coming unglued before my eyes. I was going to lose my family. - Beset by grief and confused by the cruelty of his circumstances, he began to look for answers; some way out of this madness. - Sheer and utter desperation. It was a journey that would reshape his life forever. - he started studying everything that he could about bipolar and recognizing a lot of the patterns that he'd seen with my mum in all the years that they've been married, and I think it really helped him to see that the needed to do something about it. - Do something, but what? The experts had all weighed in: both his children were spiralling into the same orbit as their mum and there seemed little hope he could save them. But Stephan resolved to find an answer and prevent any further suicides in his family. I was at the bottom of a pit and I had many different psychiatrists, many different hospitals, many facilities that I had to go to. And they just kept handing me pills. I wouldn't call it angst, I would just clearly call it hell. You know, how could such a beautiful thing of life, giving birth, cause such trauma? I just remember being very unhappy, very sad and hopeless. I never thought it would end and just saw no way to get out of it. The drugs made me completely emotionless; they made me not care; I didn't care about anything around me. The only thing I saw was my pain and the drugs made me numb to anything else. - I was diagnosed with Tourette's Syndrome. So in order to treat the Tourette Syndrome, I was put on medications. When I was little, I would just have these really violent mood swings and panic attacks, insomnia, hypersomnia; there were periods where I couldn't eat, there were periods I would eat too much. So, all of these really confusing things were happening to me and I, at that time, didn't realize that it was because of the medication that I was going through all these horrible changes. I will probably never get over the horrible guilt and the horrible - I think that part of her childhood was stolen from her. They began to basically just force me to take the medication which made me feel as though I had been betrayed by absolutely everybody, because I felt as though they were giving me these toxic things that were making me sick and violent and horrible. I didn't know by her not wanting to take the medicine that she was really trying to say to me, You know what? This isn't working. But what eight year old can verbalize that? And the psychiatrist kept saying to me, she needs this. She has to have this, and the psychiatrist was our family friend and I trusted him. They completely put their faith in this particular psychiatrist who I don't think had my best interests in mind at all. My doctor decided that electric shock therapy would be good because I was drug-resistant. So I mean, we had tried for almost a year. He just kept saying, let's try more drugs. We'll give you this. We'll do this. More shock therapy. Well, really? Like, how much more can my body take? I was 100 pounds and dying. I literally was dying. My psychiatrist decided that electric shock would be the next step, so I did a series of eight, so eight sessions of that. The ECT was a horrible experience. I loved going to school and learning, I had to drop out of school and really couldn't do the things in life that I'd always done and wanted to do. For about 16 years, I was hospitalized every year for up to three months. Finally in the last five years of my illness, I... I just said, "no more." "If you ever take me to the hospital again," I said, "I will kill myself. When my mum would call him, sort of frantic, like, Melissa's having a reaction, or Melissa's having an episode of violence, or Melissa's hurting herself, he would say, make her take the medication! The psychiatrist said, "If she doesn't listen, and she doesn't want to take the medication, you just call 911 and go over and visit the psych hospital because that's where she'll go." Gosh, I've got a list of like 20 different medications I was on by the time I was about 11. Um, we just had bags and bags full of pills and pills, in massive doses that I shouldn't have been, no child should have been prescribed. It got to the point where they prescribed Haldol and that's when I really got more concerned than ever. My mum and my sister basically found me in the game room sitting on the floor like, completely zoned-out. And I just remember this feeling of, "I'm going to die, I'm going to die, I'm going to die." [singing] And if she falls, There will be no one there to catch her When she falls, there will be no one there to catch her And hold on. Melissa ended up in the emergency room. She had a very serious psychotic reaction. I was like, oh, this is it, I've completely... gone crazy. This is insane. I don't, I don't know who I am anymore. I don't know what I'm doing anymore. I called my paediatrician and he was there in ten minutes and he said to the nurse, "Get her off of that shit." that's what he said. - It was a very very low point, often the case that I would contemplate suicide just because I... didn't know who I was anymore and, um, all these side effects that I as experiencing were so scary. You don't give a 9-year kid Haldol. - As millions filled their psychotropic prescriptions, most without anything resembling sound medical advice, other dark and troubling events kept occurring, without a whisper of warning. [phone ringing] 911, what is your emergency? - ...been shot at West-side school... middle school. - Been what? - Been shot at West-side middle school. - OK. - We need an ambulance as soon as possible - OK. Do you know who's done the shooting? - Every time we get one of these horrible killings, mass murder, some will take advantage of that to say, look, we need more forced treatment. What we really need to investigate is what role are psychiatric drugs playing in such mass killings? Are people coming off drugs? Are they on the drugs and experiencing akathisia? And there's plenty of evidence in the research literature in the way that actually psychiatric drugs can lend themselves to violent actions. One, You can have this inner-agitation. Two, coming off, you can have a worsening of symptoms, and the third part is, these drugs can diminish frontal lobe activity, the very part of the brain that when you get a really bad idea like taking a gun and going into a school that's the part of your brain that's supposed to kick in and say, that's a really evil idea, don't do it. But these drugs will diminish that activity. Every time there is some bizarre act of violence in the United States or Canada, like a school shooting or mass shooting, it is so difficult to find any mention if the shooter was on anti-psychotics or antidepressant drugs. And yet in every case I've been able to find, the person who was shooting was either on an antidepressant drug or had recently withdrawn from an antidepressant drug. And so there is some kind of real correlation which no one is properly investigating. - As part of the research for his book called The Book of Woe, Gary Greenberg was embedded with psychiatrists as they debated the new edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the DSM-5. All along, It's been clear that the DSM is essentially a work of fiction. It's the way psychiatrists have of saying that if there are mental disorders, if they exist in nature the way that illnesses like Diabetes exist, then these are what they are. Changing the way we understand ourselves, is intimately related to the development of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual. The DSM is often referred to as the Bible of psychiatric disorders. It is the quintessential diagnostic instrument. Over 400,000 mental health professionals in the United States use the DSM, and in order to get 3rd party reimbursement, one has to have a DSM diagnosis. So the DSM is extremely instrumental. - In 2005, two respected academics, Lisa Cosgrove of UMass-Boston and Sheldon Krimsky of Tufts, released their investigation into conflicts-of-interest between DSM-4 panel members and the pharmaceutical industry. - I think the data really speak for themselves. The strongest statistics include the panel members for the mood disorders and schizophrenia and psychotic disorders. A hundred percent of those panel members and yes, that's right, every single panel member has financial associations with the pharmaceutical industry. And if you look at it in terms of the sheer amount of money, um, the antidepressant market and the anti-psychotic markets are the fourth and fifth leading therapy classes of drugs with annual sales of 20 billion and 14 billion respectively. You know, the argument is well we're getting the best people; the best people are consulting for the industry, and therefore, the concept of disinterestedness is completely destroyed. And it's a self-fulfilling prophecy. If you set up the system so that you permit people with conflictual relationships to be on committees whose decisions will have financial impacts on an industry, then the whole thing is running on its own cycle of self-interest. So there are 170 DSM panel members. That is the total inclusive of all the working groups. Of those 170 panel members, 56 percent had at least one financial association with a pharmaceutical company. - Embedded with the new DSM-5 working committee, Gary Greenberg found himself caught in a fire fight of words and passions over the future of psychiatry. When the DSM is revised, there are fights, and in this particular case there were some really intense fights, because there was an attempt on the part of the American Psychiatric Association to finally come up with the DSM to end all DSMs. Now you can't expect to revise a staple like the DSM for the first time in 20 years without experiencing some glitches, and believe me, we had more than our share. It was like being in the middle of a war. But the APA kept its composure, rallied when attacked by our enemies, and occasionally by our friends, too, to make the DSM a resounding success. And uh, it didn't work. They failed and they found it very difficult to walk back from the promises that they'd made. And the people that took them on weren't the scientologists, they were psychiatrists. One of them, in fact, had written the last DSM. - This political infighting left millions of consumers with psychiatric diagnoses in limbo. The DSM decision-makers may not have considered that but their actions over the last 30 years have reverberated in sad and profound ways. - Pretend that I'm the Glaxo CEO. What would you like to say to me? [chuckles] Yeah... - For David Carmichael, there are good reasons why this is is not an easy question to answer. - My Dad and I have always been really close. Um, you know, both my parents did everything for my brother and I. If there was, you know, a sport we wanted to pick up, or if there was something we wanted to do, we did everything. My dad built my brother a half pipe in our backyard and it was like a professionally built half pipe. Like, this thing was phenomenal. And we had kids from all over the neighbourhood come there to ride it because it was huge. There's nothing more exhilarating than being a dad. In everything I've ever done, it was magical moments. Our daughter, Gillian was born in 1990, and our son, Ian was born in 1992. And both my wife and I took a nurturing approach to parenting. They didn't get everything they wanted, but they certainly had a lot of opportunity when they were young. And it was wonderful. My brother got into dirt jumping as well, so my Dad built my brother a dirt jump at our cottage. My brother would just spend hours out there and he loved it. - I remember the deliveries like they were yesterday. I remember the snowstorm I had to get through when Ian was being delivered in 1992. It was December the 14th, that's when he was born, I got a call at the organization I was working at, got home, got in the car. He was rushed right in the delivery room. It was a very quick delivery. Gillian took over 20 hours. Ian was very quick. We were the ideal family on the block and I had a lot of friends who just would continuously tell me that, that we were a perfect family. - The Carmichael's perfect family began to unhinge shortly after David began taking Paxil. I really didn't know very much about mental illness until when I was 45 years old, and I had my first major depression. And I was treated with Paxil and in fact, when I look back on it now, there's no question I was a manic when I was on Paxil for the first time. That was the very first time that I I ever even looked at the issues around drugs, and side effects of drugs. I noticed that there was a big difference before he started taking medication and then while he was taking the medication. I remember him snapping on me about something very small and I remember him spending so much time at his office. I remember him being... just being more quiet and not being himself and looking stressed out, and... just looking different. You know, when I went to the doctor I was prescribed Paxil. And I had gained a fair bit of weight, I, um, had sexual dysfunction issues, and my resting heart rate was higher. And there was just... this tremendous discomfort with being on that particular drug. It really made me wonder, you know, should I be on it? - Like so many who tumbled into the world of antidepressants without forethought, David Carmichael did so unaware of the potential dangers. When I was on Paxil, we had no idea it could trigger delusions, or, none of that was out in the public domain. For so many years, I just assumed my doctor knew best. I learned about the side effects the hard way. It's like I can't participate in life, I'm too busy worrying. - When everything happened, I had just finished Grade 8. For my friends, who knew my father, they just knew that something was wrong, because they knew who my dad was. And you just would never in a million years think that he would do something that he did. Yeah I... parenting was a high priority of mine, to be the best parent possible. And to have it end this way is pretty devastating. [slow soulful singing] - David Carmichael had been on 60mg of Paxil for two weeks when he and Ian set out for one of their favourite father-son activities: a BMX bike competition in London, Ontario. - What I've learned in this journey is I no longer take for granted even one breath. Things get reduced to the minutes, and you know you have the strength for that minute. [girls singing] It's a whole new world and that's the place I've never been, When I'm way up here... David and I were friends in college. We were both accounting majors. David was that funny, brilliant guy that you always wanted in your group. - David was a guy you'd want to be around. that's about the best way to explain. When you met him, he was gregarious, he was open, he was funny; he was very witty. - My dad was a very caring Father, very funny, too. He'd wake me up in the morning singing whatever group I was into at the time: it was Spice Girls when I was little he's a brilliant auditor. Auditing for a major corporation is stressful and there's a lot of things that go with it if you want to do the right thing. - David was a guy who, like any of us, had his share of challenges in life, we all do. Especially in a big financial company, there's stresses in our work, there's pressures. Um, you know, we have kids to raise, bills to pay. We went to the psychiatrist in early 2006 and he said, well, what about Prozac? - You have a chemical imbalance. Let's put you on Prozac. It's the standard of care. It's what they do. It's almost a marketing strategy that works, you know? It's not my fault. I have a disease. Within days of ingesting Prozac, David Crespi became troubled. Towards the end of just talking back and forth and he said, Do you ever feel like life is too dark to go on? It's crazy. It's not the way I think. Those thoughts aren't natural to me. I recall a few events from the day before that would suggest that he was going psychotic. David was jumping out of the bed and walking around a throw rug and hitting each corner and then jumping back into bed. And I'm going, what are you doing? He goes, it just feels good. Well, now I attribute that to akathisia. [police radio] Code 6 - 105 North Avenue 52. Our tragedy was January 20, 2006. On that day, took all the kids to school, left to go get my haircut, left the girls in the care of their loving father; they wanted to spend time with him. When I came back into the neighbourhood after being gone for an hour and fifteen minutes, I saw a police barricade, and I saw some of my very concerned neighbours coming towards me. The police officer asked my name and he said, we're going to need you in this house [phone rings] - Police Department. - Yes. I just killed my two daughters. - You just what? - I just killed my two daughters. I called my dad in California and I made sure my stepmother was right next to him, and I said, you know, Dad, I have to tell you something really hard." I said, "I'm in the back of a police car and I've just been told that David killed Sam and Tess. - What did you do to them? - I stabbed them. - You stabbed them? - Yeah. - How many times did you stab them? - I don't know. I don't remember. - OK, keep talking to me, because you sound like you're a little bit tired. - This is for real - I know, I know It's real, Sir. Everybody is on their way, okay? Cathy, my stepmother adored Sam and Tess, as we all did started wailing. And I could hear her on the speaker phone and my dad goes, Honey, Dave would not do that. "David is not like that. You're mistaken. I went, I wish I were, but I'm in the back of a squad car... [siren] The Crespi children were escorted from school by the police and were told nothing until Kim arrived at the station. - they really thought that their dad had killed himself. - My Mum came in and told us, they're telling me that Dad killed your sisters. We had to use the language, they're telling me , because we couldn't believe that that's what actually happened. - The idea of him killing Tess and Sam was so foreign, but they knew something had happened. And that's how the whole thing started. - I went to the doctor and I can remember saying, I'm afraid I may hurt someone. Well she said, You re too compassionate to do that. "that's just the depression talking. Never was anybody saying, the medicine can do this. Psychosis, the drug, killed our daughters. Who I am was chemically altered. My Dad in his right mind wouldn't have done anything like this. I can remember this battle of these thoughts aren't real. Because when you have a complete psychotic break like that, and you kill two of your most treasured people in your life, people that every other day, every other day he would have died for them. What I did was done on a cocktail of legal drugs. We were doing what the doctors told us to do. We were being responsible. Just because something's legal doesn't mean It's safe. I suspect anybody hearing my story will go, yeah, that's not going to happen to me, but it could. If it happened to us, it could happen to anyone. But I know for certain, that I know what caused the death of my daughters. I know it was the pills. And for all of that, we're serving two back-to-back life sentences. [slow soulful singing] On July 31st, 2004, I had been on Paxil for three weeks. I took Ian to a hotel room in London, Ontario and... at 3 o'clock in the morning, thinking that he had permanent brain damage, that he was in living hell, he was going to kill my daughter, Gillian, and he was going to harm other kids and my wife was going to have a nervous breakdown, which were my five delusions, I strangled him, and I sat with his body for six hours until I called the police at 9 o'clock in the morning, very calmly saying that I'd committed homicide and opened the door for them, and then I was arrested and charged with first degree murder. When the police came in and arrested me, they asked me why didn't I run. I said, I wanted to stay with my son. "he's in a better place now. He was in living hell. And I stayed with him as long as possible. - For 14 long days, David Carmichael was psychotic, and suffered drug withdrawals in his jail cell, before awakening to the ultimate terror. - The psychosis lasted for two weeks and after I came out of my psychosis a couple of weeks after everything happened, I was devastated. I cried for three days in segregation at the London Middlesex Detention Centre. I could not believe what I had done. - Ian was laid to rest by David's family. It would be months before DNA tests indicated that Carmichael's body was unable to metabolize the Paxil he'd ingested and that the drug was the likely cause of this unthinkable act. Dr. Peter Breggin says he's seen it all before. Many people do not have the array of enzymes in their livers to properly destroy SSRI drugs when they get in the bloodstream. So the drugs pass through the liver, and they don't get, quote, "metabolised", meaning they don't get broken down. So might get the equivalent of a 10 mg dose of an SSRI, but your blood level is 30 or 40 mg. And there are studies out of Australia correlating the violence with the lack of the enzyme for these drugs. The public has no understanding of how Paxil or other SSRI could trigger a homicidal psychotic episode and they may not care, you know, but there is evidence based on DNA that Paxil did cause me to kill my son, Ian. And it's something that I have to live with. Even when I'm out in the public, you know, my stigma is off the chart compared to the stigma around mental illnesses. But if people beat me up emotionally when I'm out there, that's fine. They'll never beat me up as much as I beat myself up for a long time. - For her part, Gillian, who was only 14 when the tragedy occurred, says she grew up the day she grasped what had really happened to her father. I realized who he was before, who he was during the period of time that he was taking the medication, and I realized that they were two different people. - David credits Gillian as the reason he did not take his own life while in prison. There were several times when I was either in jail or in a psychiatric hospital where I felt like taking my own life. What kept me going was my daughter, Gillian. I had one line and it was, I'm a good dad. I'm going to be a dad again. And that was my hope. And I know Gillian, whatever she was doing, wherever she was, was thinking that she wanted her dad back in her life too. How can I not accept him back? he's, you know, he's an amazing man. he's my father and I love him. - David Carmichael was found not criminally responsible for his son's death as two psychiatrists, one working for the defence and one for the prosecution, both agreed that he was psychotic at the time of the tragedy. The public is not going to care about this. You know, no empathy for me, but I think, I'll tell you what the pain will never go away. - Ian was just an amazing person and he was an amazing brother. And he was an amazing friend and amazing son. He just, he had so much life. Yeah. Sorry. - Pretend that I'm the Glaxo CEO. What would you like to say to me? [chuckles] Yeah. If you were the GlaxoSmithKline CEO, I would like to... encourage you to be more honest with the Canadian public. And if there are serious side effects to any one of your drugs, it's not just about sending out notices to health care professionals that many of them never read. You've got to go directly to consumers and make them aware of some of these dangers. That's a responsibility that you have as a drug company. - I was only put on for weight loss - weight loss! - My sister did commit suicide in front of Lindsay... - That gun I later learned was loaded with hollow point bullets... [cacophony of voices] -... and the only way to have peace and serenity again was to die. - Do all of you want to take this drug? Do all of you want to walk around humiliated for the rest of your life? - Thirteen years had passed since the dramatic 1991 FDA-Prozac hearings. By 2004, The British government had virtually banned SSRIs for children and young adults, in light of the real risk of suicide and violence. But in America, the US FDA remained unconvinced, and demanded more studies. This was welcome news at Pfizer, GSK, and The House That Prozac Built. - We didn't know what the result was going to be. We had no idea, but we wanted, we thought getting as right an answer as possible was the right thing to do. In 1983, nine years before the launch of Zoloft in the United States, 21 years before the FDA required Pfizer to put a black box warning on it, Pfizer had done a healthy volunteer trial on Zoloft in the UK. They recruited 12 women to this trial. Half of them were to be given Zoloft, the other half were given a placebo. The trial was due to run for two weeks but stopped after a week because every single woman taking Zoloft had become anxious, apprehensive, agitated. One or two had begun to voice thoughts about harming others. All of the things that led FDA to put a black box warning on this drug 21 years later were there in 83. What was more, Pfizer looked at this trial and wrote down, Zoloft has caused this problem. - For Mathy Downing, and thousands like her, the earth-shattering epiphanies came weeks too late. Ironically, it happens that the doctor that approved Zoloft as an antidepressant for children, Tom Laughren, ironically, I know this man. because both of his daughters attended school with my daughters for eight years. - For over 20 years, Thomas Laughren was head of FDA's psycho-pharmacology division. I had no idea he worked at FDA until I saw him on the FDA panel three weeks after Candace died. I sat there with my husband and we listened for eight hours while person after person after person basically told our story. I went up to speak with him when the meeting was over and I said, where can I find information about those contraindications? And he told me he would give me a list of people for me to talk to, and then I never spoke to him again. I mean, he's a father of two of my daughters friends. I really did think he would help me, I thought he would follow through and help me gain the information I needed, but he didn't. - As fate would have it, yet another FDA hearing on SSRIs and violence was held in September 2004. In one brief, emotionally-charged moment, Mathy Downing stepped up the microphone. And when I spoke at the FDA hearings on September 13, I addressed him personally. - After months of grieving and too-few answers, Mathy Downing finally let loose. The blood of these children are on your hands. I remember seeing Mathy Downing stand up at the hearing and confront the... Laughren and the other FDA panel members and say, you know, the blood of my daughter is on your hands. And she was right. - Later, Mathy Downing learned that Thomas Laughren had been in the thick of the sSRI controversy since well before the 1991 Prozac hearings. Some of the people we find as the original culprits, the problem at FDA, Dr. Bob Temple; Thomas Laughren is horribly guilty. All these same individuals were involved back in the early 90s when this risk was being raised and identified, and rather than pursuing safety concerns or requiring drug companies to do more to determine if this is a serious risk, they looked the other way. - Laughren left FDA in 2012 and started a new business, dedicated to helping drug companies get FDA approval for their drugs. But he was not alone at the intersection of public service and personal profit. I do not find from the evidence today that there is credible evidence to support a conclusion that antidepressant drugs cause the emergence and/ or the intensification of suicidality and/or other violent behaviours. - When Dr. Daniel Casey resurfaced, nine years after the 1991 Prozac hearings he chaired, he did so as a paid expert witness for Pfizer. Attorney Andy Vickery conducted the deposition. - You were the Chairman of that committee for several years, right? Yes. The chairman of that committee who is moderating it in a public building in a public place was wearing a bullet proof vest. - Dr. Casey, did you wear a bulletproof vest to that meeting? Yes. - Had you ever worn one prior to that time? No. - Have you ever worn one since? - No. ...because he thought one of the family members of the people being harmed by Prozac would shoot him. - You certainly did not believe it was the folks on the Eli Lilly side of the coin, did you? No. No conflict of interest? - And yet that would not effect your objectivity. - Is that your testimony? - Yes. - Others, like Harvard University's influential Dr. Joseph Biederman, also seem to display an unnerving indifference to their conflicts-of-interest. Here, Biederman was being deposed as a key thought-leader , one of those most responsible for spreading the off-label use of the anti-psychotic Risperdal to millions of teens. In a remote town in western Canada, the Stephan family was facing a life and death struggle in the shadow of the Rocky Mountains. Two of Debbie Stephan's children were exhibiting the same symptoms that had ultimately claimed her life: Joseph was becoming frighteningly violent and his sister Autumn was succumbing to severe bipolar, with its mercurial mood swings. Their father, Tony Stephan, was desperate and searching for any way to save his children, when drug after drug failed. The answer came from what seemed the unlikeliest of places: micro nutrients, mainly minerals. - I remember the earlier days of doing the testing with nutrients and different things. I think they were trying to reduce some liquid mineral thing to... you know, so you didn't have to drink a whole cup of something, it could be an ounce, and I don't think it worked very good, and it smelled funny. I remember the smell and I can still taste it in the back of my throat. I think they burned it, I'm not sure. At first it didn't work. It did not work. - I just remember I was out camping and I had a little bottle of, I call it rust water, it was the colour of rust, and I was supposed to drink a little ounce of that every day, a couple of times. And so I would be doing that. I mean, it was so experimental, I didn't even really understand what we were really doing here. We put him on a cocktail that contained vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and amino acids. I was absolutely livid when I found out that he had taken Joseph off of his medication, and I said some terrible things to him. I, I... told him it was on his head, the next suicide in this family was going to be his fault. - I remember about six weeks into this program that we sat together on the couch and he said, where was I? What happened to me? "Why was I so angry all of the time? I said, don't go there, you don't have to. "Live the day now. You re here. Be in the present. It was like one day waking up and a fog had completely lifted, and that was amazing. It was a very real turning point in my life. - With Joseph on the mend, Tony Stephan then turned his attention to his daughter Autumn, who had been in and out of psych wards. - I ended up in my dad's custody and he has a friend who was a male psych nurse who decided to hang around the house a lot and honestly, I look back on it now, I think that they were waiting for a moment when they would have legal justification to force me to go on this micro-nutrient stuff. And at time, it was like this crazy concoction with liquids and powders, and you know, pills and things and I had said no, and my husband had said, No. We re not doing that. And my psychiatrist said, No! In fact, he said, don't rock the boat. "You will die. Do not go off of this medication. And I was on that five-drug cocktail at the time. And so I had absolutely no intention of doing what my dad had already started with my brother Joseph, no intention. I won't say that I forced her to do it because that doesn't sound politically correct, but I constrained her to do it. You know, and she just didn't believe that this was going to work at all. And I said, Just keep taking your medications. "I don't care. You know how to take your meds. Take this with it. Just keep taking it. So they waited until I had a little med breakthrough and I went rummaging for a knife, and there was some screaming involved, and he and this friend of his who happened to be a psychiatric nurse, um, stuffed me with a bunch of Ativan and put me to bed. And then, while I was still really nicely sedated, began force feeding me the concoctions. - Back in 1996, when I first met Autumn Stringam, it was the first day I also met her father Tony Stephan. And was sitting there in front of us, completely normal, very bright, very articulate, very charming young woman, um, doing very well on vitamins and minerals, but she had lived through this horrible, horrible period and could remember it so vividly. Uh, it was very impressive. You knew that you were hearing a true story, and I think that that has come through consistently with Autumn. I recognize that a huge percentage of people with bipolar commit suicide and it just as easily could have been me, and it isn't, because something really beautiful happened in my life. And I have to acknowledge that, you know, that's not just mine to take and run away with, but that there's a lot of good that can be done in the world, knowing what I know now. - These were just three people from Southern Alberta, who believed that they had fixed two children in Tony's family and they did it with vitamins and minerals off the shelf. And they just desperately wanted a scientist somewhere to take them seriously and do some research. - When Stephan and Truehope approached Dr. Kaplan in 1996, she was the Director of Behavioural Research for the University of Calgary. As a scientist, she was highly sceptical, and thought the notion of utilising minerals for mental illness was simply preposterous. I think Bonnie, when we first met her, she kind of thought that we were flaky because all of a sudden, you have these two strange dudes coming from Southern Alberta and they've got this idea that you can take people suffering with these intractable, incurable mental disorders and change them and bring them around, when all along, science hasn't been able to do that. I thought, well, that's impossible. "You can't do that. There's no way it would have that effect. But I think that line of thought is reflective of our lack of education about nutrition, and the fact that blood is bathing the neurons in our brain every minute of every day, bringing oxygen and what? Micro-nutrients to make those brain cells work. - Stephan and his co-founder created a non-profit called Truehope and after years of experimentation, they developed a mineral-based formula called Empower Plus. Intrigued by Autumn and Joseph's successful transformations, Dr. Kaplan and others continued studying the formula for bipolar disorder, ADHD, and depression. Some people call this a micro-nutrient sledgehammer, because it's all of the vitamins, and a very long list of dietary minerals. The patients in this sample got much better, in fact more than 50 percent better. Quite a few of them were more than 75 percent better. - He wasn't trying to build an empire when he set out to save me and Joe. It was not a deliberate act. He's not a formulator. It was a conversation that led to an idea that led to an answer and that's all he was ever in it for. And he's faced so much opposition for doing the right thing. He's faced a lot of opposition for that and I think it's changed the course of his whole life. - As it has with Dr. Kaplan. When she first presented her findings about the Truehope mineral-vitamin combination to the Canadian Psychiatric Association's Annual Meeting in 2001, she and the company were immediately under attack. When I went to graduate school, they did not prepare me to be personally attacked for just doing objective research. That was a little shocking. We took a lot of arrows for about five years especially, longer for the Truehope people, but it was very, very tough. When you try and investigate a new paradigm, the resistance is incredible. I watched Dr. Kaplan go through this. We had major resistance form Health Canada shutting down trials. I mean, here, the Alberta government had provided 554,000 dollars so that she could continue the work. And Health Canada came in and swathed the trial. They destroyed it. - Health Canada not only shut down Dr. Kaplan's scientific investigation into micro-nutrients and mental health, they ordered Truehope to stop manufacturing Empower Plus. When the company refused, they seized the product at the US-Canadian border and banned it for sale in Canada. - Why? We're talking about vitamins and minerals here. Well, what that tells you is anything that challenges commercial interests, such as that maybe micro-nutrients or nutrients are a good thing to do, boy, there are powerful forces behind a commercial story, and they will come forth. - When Truehope fought back through the Courts, and won, it wasn't long thereafter that Health Canada mobilized the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to conduct a guns-drawn raid at the Truehope offices in Alberta. Health Canada spent 2 million dollars to prosecute Truehope for charges, that had they been found guilty, would have amounted to a 375 dollar fine. Um, they lost. Health Canada lost, but all of those costs to defend ourselves were not recouped from Health Canada. Despite Pharma's falsified science and billion-dollar fines for fraudulent marketing and in spite of millions who were harmed by psychiatric drugs Health Canada decided that it was this tiny non-profit that needed to be shown the full might of the Canadian government. There has been a huge bias against nutrition research. Who's triggering that? Who, what is the political agenda that is continually bombarding us with the message that taking vitamins and minerals might not be a good thing? I don't get that. But the result is that there is a lot of bias against people who say not only should we take them, we should be studying it more and we should see whether or not there's treatment benefit from vitamins and minerals. What I'm going to talk about today may sound as radical as hand washing sounded to a mid-19th century doctor, and yet it is equally as scientific. It is the simple idea that optimizing nutrition is a safe and viable way to avoid, treat or lessen mental illness. - After nearly two decades of wrangling with Health Canada, and three-quarters of a million dollars in court costs and legal fees for Truehope, Bonnie Kaplan, Julia Rucklidge, and others continue to investigate the use of nutrients as a primary treatment for mental health. Yet the road has been anything but easy. I was very aware of how many people were incredibly sceptical about this work. I was trained as a scientist and we need to evaluate the evidence. What has astounded me is the obstacles that we faced in order to try to answer what's a, I think, a very important question for our community. I happen to think that medications are very important, especially in acute crises. But, to me they're the supplement, in the ideal world. I believe that it would be more beneficial to a lot of people especially developing children, um, to be treated first with everything psychosocial, family therapy, etcetera, and nutritional, which is not going to cause any long term harm, and that that should be primary intervention. It took me two more months to get off of the rest of my medication and I'd say the better part of the year before I felt like I was just really stable. There are going to be people who want to say that, you know, I'm just trying to make a lot of money off of a big made-up story, but my mother's dead in the ground. Her dad's dead. We all know how that happened. She had a prescription, and there's some things you just can't argue with, you know? And uh... and I'm not dead. And I've got four healthy kids and a great marriage. And that's something I didn't expect would ever happen with me. [slow music] The lesson of a generation's worth of psychiatric experiments is that regulators didn't protect the public; doctors didn't protect their patients; journalists refused to ask the tough questions; the pharmaceutical companies played the system and profited handsomely; and millions suffered, died, became addicts, or were otherwise harmed. You know, a lot of times parents think that their eight or nine-year-old just won't understand; it's just easier to just give them the medications. But not telling your kid why they're taking the medication or what the medication is supposed to do can be really harmful. And having that kernel of knowledge that these things that I was experiencing weren't me but were caused by a medication, I think would've been... would've saved a lot of pain. A lot of pain. We've been through a lot. And she stopped taking the drugs and a new kid, you know, came forward. Straight As at the University of St. Thomas; summa cum laude; valedictorian; unbelievable. Here is this child that I was afraid would never get out of her bedroom is now doing what she's doing. So... Um, at any rate, it's, it's a great thing that I have a kid who has the tenacity and the... had the ability to tell us what she needed. And I'm afraid there are a lot of kids who aren't like that, and they're going to be in a stupor or worse. - These are stories of those who have fallen and of those who have somehow survived. Many lost sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, and their tragedies forced these private people out of the shadows. They wanted answers and were not interested in the politics of medicine. If the truth had been afforded us decades ago, millions would have been spared similar fates. It's a very primitive thing, missing your children. You miss their warmth and their smell and their lovely, lovely presence. - Perhaps change is coming, albeit too slowly. But until it occurs, we should take nothing for granted: not our loves, nor our lives, or the gift of our families and friends. As these Letters From Generation Rx have taught us, there is peril in the conventional wisdom of treating so many people so indiscriminately, with such powerful, life-changing drugs. You know, if somebody said to me that Brennan could come back to life and I'd never see him again, but I know that he could live his life, the biggest loss for me, is the wonderful life he could have had. 'Cause he would have been a great dad. He was a great friend to everybody. If that's what it took, then I would do that in a second. - As they mourn every birthday, every holiday; every anniversary of a loved one's death, their only prayer is to stop this from happening to anyone else.
