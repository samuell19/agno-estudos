(dramatic piano music) (slow piano music) - That's all. (people chattering) (tapping) At 0900, the Japanese surrendered to the allied forces. It's over. (cheering) (cheering) (slow piano music) (birds chirping) (slow piano music) - Good. Good. Good. You have five men in this ward, Sister. You still can't see they do their nets correctly? - Benedict finds the loops difficult my matron-- - See it done again and done correctly. - You don't seem to understand. - Giving you sole charge in this ward, Sister, does not give you the right to change my rules. In fact, I think I might change you to another ward. - No! (yelling) - Matron! (yelling) - Sister, I will speak to you-- (laughing) (groaning) - If you can't control your patients, Sister, I'll take sterner meter to isolate your ward. - Isolate? Sir, Ward X is already a limbo. The patients, no one knows what to do with, they're sent to X and forgotten. - Ward X exists because the army wants it to exist. The men are there because the army says so. - We don't have a whisper of psychiatric qualification between the two of us, and that does not help Sargent Maynard. - Who is Sargent Maynard? - Benedict Maynard. - Oh yes, the matron's assailant. - His case is far too serious for us to treat here. He should be back in Australia with the experts. This latest incident proves it. - Sister, the war is over. We'll be home in a few weeks. We don't want to swamp everyone with unnecessary paperwork, now do we? - Sir-- - That's enough Sister. - Yes sir. (upbeat music) (people chattering) (upbeat music) (exhaling} (soft piano music) (man whimpering) (gasping) (whimpering) (soft piano music) (man laughing) (soft piano music) (sobbing) Good night, Neil. (soft piano music) - Good night, Sis. (soft piano music) Good night. (soft piano music) (insects buzzing) (tapping) - Your turn. - [Nugget] I cleared up yesterday. - You did not, you reckoned you were sick! - Yeah, well, I'm still pretty crook. - Well let Matt do it. Aye, Matt? See how many plates you can drop. - I did it yesterday! You're always wormin' wormin' out of it. - I'll beat your head in you-- - I'll draw up a roster so there'll be no more arguments, alright? In the meantime, you can clear away your own plates. - Oh, I'll give you a hand, ma'am. (insects buzzing) - Sorry. - [Honour] How's the tummy, Nugget? - Right as rain, Sis. I'm in remission. It was all that noise yesterday bringing it on. - [Luce] Yeah you got Sis in trouble yesterday. - [Honour] No one got anyone into trouble. - You should be reported to the colonel. I know he's evil. I know you're evil. - Oh yeah, and what's he gonna do about it? He's not a colonel's boot lace, he's more a chin strap. (laughing) Colonel Chinstrap. (laughing) ♪ Colonel Chinstrap went to war to become a phony ♪ ♪ He stuck a mustache on his lip ♪ ♪ And filled it with bologna ♪ (laughing) (tapping) (whistling) (tapping) (whistling) - These are Matt's. Why is it always Matt's shirts that lose their buttons? - And, Luce. - Will you continue painting when you go home? - Oh no. - Why not? - I'll probably join my father's business. I think it's time I settled down, don't you? - You'll have to make your own decisions, Neil. - I am over my break down now, Sis. Thanks to you. Let me finish. You've taken away the pain. Without you, Ward X would be a miserable sort of place. - That's what I'm here for. - I could face going back, if I thought, once we're home. And what with my family knowing your family, and, I won't be your patient anymore. You've only ever seen me at my worst. At home it'll be different. What I'm trying to say is-- - Sis! Sis. There's a bloke outside and he reckons he's been sent to X. - It's alright, Nugget. I'm sorry, Neil. I have to go. - You knew. - I was told to expect another patient, yes, of course. (birds chirping) Hello. Wilson. M.E.J. - Wilson, Michael Edward John. - What do they call you? Do they call you Michael, Mike? - Michael, Mike. It doesn't matter which. - Come on, I'll introduce you to the men. (birds chirping) Michael. I'd like you to meet Neil Parkinson. - Oh for Christ's sake, stuff it. We're all the same here. - Oh, speak for yourself. The only reason I'm in here is to shut me up. I'm a danger to them. - You don't look tropo to me. - Nor to me. Does he look tropo to you, Matt? - Oh cut that out. - That's enough. Thank you Luce. - Sis. - Ben? It's alright. - You're wearing a lot of spaghetti. Join up with the first batch. - Whoopee another hero. - Oh what would you know about it, you side show freak? They had to drag you into the army squealing like a stuck pig. - Well it's better than being a murderer. Hey Ben? - I said that's enough. Did you find out what's keeping dinner, Ben? - Yes. It's coming, Sis. - And I'd like you to set another plate at the table for me. Will you do that? Thank you. Well, I'll show you where to put your kit. (birds chirping) They're not as bad as they might seem. - Oh, who's complaining? Look at this. All the comforts of home, and a mum, too. - So you don't resent being sent here? - Oh, no. I don't resent being sent here. It's not nearly as senseless as some of the orders I've had to follow. - I'll let you unpack your kit, and then we'll have a chat after dinner. - Oh, Sister? Let's get one thing straight. There's nothing wrong with my mind. (birds chirping) Jesus Christ. - Put that down! (birds chirping) What are you doing in here, Luce? - I, uh, (clearing throat) I wanted a late pass, Sister. - Well sorry, Sargent. No late passes until you learn some manners. Did you read those papers? (chuckling) (birds chirping) (birds chirping) - [Matt] Sister's leaving, aint she? - [Neil] She'll be back for tea, old chap. (lighter clicking) (birds chirping) - The war's really turned things inside out. Hard to figure a woman in authority over a bunch of blokes. - Sis is a lady, if you wish. (birds chirping) (people chattering) - Oh there she goes, dead on time. I mean, who do they think they're kidding? - There's another party in the nurse's quarters tonight. You coming? - Nope, no. I'm hanging up my feet. - Oh. - Honour? - No I can't, I've got a new patient. - Oh, what's this one's problem? - I don't know. I don't even know why they sent him here. He seems so sane. - Why'd they send you to X? - I tried to kill a bloke. - Not one of the enemy then? - The R.S.M. - Oh, that's no reason. Crikey, name one bloke who hasn't wanted to do in his R.S.M. - Some even kill their whole company. - Bite your tongue, Luce. (Nugget yelling) (yelling) - [Nugget] Oh. Oh, it hurts. (groaning) (groaning) - What's the matter with him? - [Nugget] It's me hiatus hernia. Gets me every time I eat. - [Luce] Every time it's your turn to clean up, you mean. - No! No, it's me stomach protrudes, upwards in me mediastinal cavity. - [Michael] I'll do it. - It's Nugget's turn, mate, what do you think? Sis drew up a roster. You can't throw out Sis' roster. (clattering) - You like to do things for your mates, do ya? (chuckling) (Nugget whimpering) (insects buzzing) (cracking) (insects buzzing) (insects buzzing) - Sit down, please, Michael. Men haven't been giving you too hard a time, I hope? - I can look after myself, Sister. - Why do you think the army sent you here? - It's all there in my papers. - Oh, I've learned official papers are often wrong. If these are correct, you should have been court marshaled. Not sent to X. - Look, Sister, I don't care why I'm here. It shouldn't matter to you. - You're fencing with me, Michael. - It's finished with, that's all. - I can't help you if you won't talk to me. - I'm not one of your patients. - You were sent here, and that makes you one of my patients. - Alright. But I don't need your help. - We're waiting, Sis. - I won't be long, Neil. Michael, um, you need some sand shoes. I'll take you to stores in the morning. - Oh, sorry. You've never been late before. - I have a new patient. - He seems normal. - Yes, he does. (insects buzzing) (clattering) - [Neil] Michael's making tea. - Yes, I know. - Yes. Oh. Oh. I, I can't play unless I'm white, Neil. - Oh now look, old chap, that defeats the whole purpose of choosing. - But I can't play unless I'm white, Neil. Neil. - You're white. - Yes, I'm white. You be black, Neil. - Yes, I'll be black. - You be black. - This must be yours, Sister. - Yes. It was a-- - It's Nugget's turn to do that. He's spoiling our roster, this bloke, Sis. - Well it won't hurt this once, Ben. - No. - It was a birthday present. From the men. - How old are ya? - How dare you? It's none of your business how old she is. - She's the cat's mother. This is Sister Langtry. - I'm 30. - And you're not married, or widowed? - Oh Sis, I'm feeling crook again. Feels like me enters inception-- Oh, it's diverticulitis. - There's a milk of magnesia on my desk, Nugget. - Yeah, well aren't you gonna give it to me? - If you didn't sit around all day reading medical books, you would feel a lot better than you're actually feeling-- (hitting) - [Honour] You'd better take your pulse and count your respirations for me. - Yeah, see, Sis know. Sis knows about it all. - Sis knows. Sis knows. - I'm neither. (insects buzzing) - It's nearly 10, isn't it, Sis? Luce is gonna be late. - No, I doubt it, Ben. - Excuse me. (pouring) Hm. Michael makes a nice cup of tea. (animals vocalizing) Why'd you let him talk to you like that? - Like what? - Well like an equal. - I treat him the same as everyone else. - Oh? What's he doing here? - Neil, you know I don't discuss cases with another patient. - Another patient? Is that all I am? - Until we leave here, yes. (animals vocalizing) (soft violin music) Morning. - Morning, Sis. - G'day Sis. What's going on? - [Neil] No, nothing. - Morning Sis. - Nugget. - Morning. - Morning. (birds chirping) (clattering) (clearing throat) (birds chirping) (slow piano music) (sighing) - Benedict has been a dick head. (mumbling) Benedict, Bene, good day. All around. - Calm down. - Thank you Jesus, gran, God, Sis, Holy Ghost, amen. - [All] Amen. (slow piano music) - Looks like you're in for a bit of competition Captain Oxford University. - Oh shut up, freak. (laughing) - Sis isn't like that. - She'd never break the rules. - There's no claimin' fear. - Oh, pissants. He's not tropo. He's just different. And she'll find out how different. (birds chirping) - [Michael] I was a dairy farmer. I got 300 acres in the mainland. - Another bush bunny. My father's got a property near Yass. - But you went to Sydney like Luce? - Up to Sydney, yes, but not like Luce. - No, I beg your pardon, Sister. - You'd better call me Sis, like all the others. - Alright, Sis, I will. But not like all the others. (birds chirping) - Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? - You're off limits, soldier. - Excuse me, I had no idea. - It can't be. Luce! Lucius Daggett. I'm Susan. Sue Pedder. I was in the same class as your Sister. My father was a bank manager? - Sue. Well what do you know. - This is fantastic. - Oh, you've grown. - I didn't miss one of your plays on the wireless. - You didn't? - You're awfully good, Luce. - That's sweet of you. - [Sue] I mean it. I followed your career. All the girls did. I just wish I'd been able to get to the city to see you on the stage. What are you doing here? Were you wounded? - Close, a few times. - Well what ward are you in? - X. Well there's a lot of battle fatigued patients there, you know. - Major Castilles nearly put me there when I arrived, but, I got changed to theater. - At least I'm still alive. - Must have been awful. (Luce chuckling) - And they say I have to stay here in Ward C, until they ship us home. My arm is getting much better. - "My arm is getting much better." - So I can write to you myself soon. Love and kisses to all the kids. - "Kisses to all the kids." - And my total love, as usual. - "Total love, as usual." - 77? Sis, me pulse is 77. - That's normal, Nugget. - Yeah, but why? It's never been normal before. - Matt. I want to arrange that test with neurology. - No, Sis. - You haven't had an examination in three months. - What's the point? I'm blind. - If you accept that, why are you lying to your wife? - No! - There's your tea. You having a cup of tea, Michael? - I'll get one later, thanks. (insects buzzing) (thunder and lightening) - Luce is cutting it fine tonight. - He's on the prowl. - [Matt] Like an alley cat. - [Ben] I hope he stays out all night! - I hope he doesn't. Or he's in trouble. - If you report him, maybe they'll send him away. He should not be here with us here. He's evil! He's bad! He's bad. He's bad. - Ah, soft. What light through yonder window breaks. It is the east and Lily Langtry is the south. - Speak of the devil. - Just in time for tea. Not one second too late, aye, Benedict? - [Nugget] 83! It's 83 now, Sis. That's three above normal, isn't it? - What? Will no one ask me where I've been? Well I've been with a girl of my old hometown, Little Miss Whoop Whoop. All the way from Whoop Whoop to Base 15. "Your mother used to do my mother's washing," she said. "And you used to have to carry the basket," she said. "And my father was the bank manager," she said. "Oh, well that would have won you a lot of friends "with an impression on," I said, foreclosing left, right, and center. - That is hardly fair on the girl. - Oh, Matt. Matthew. What a shame you're such a great, big coward, and unable to see her finer attributes, but still, I suppose you could go by touch. Get a bit of practice in before you get home to missus. - Sargent Daggett! - I've got a pain in me gut, Sis. - Why didn't you stay at home with your mummy? (Nugget sobbing) - Watch it, Luce! You're being pure ire. - Oh, captain. Words, words, words, words. Is that how you slaughtered all your men? - You just stop it! Just stop it. - Alright, Sis. I'll be a good little boy if you promise not to scold me anymore. Move! (Nugget sobbing) Anyway. "Don't hold the past against me," she said. "How could I hold anything against a pretty "little thing like you?" I said. - You're dirty, filthy. - Shut up! - Even though you're not a gentleman, with your past career, you might at least act like one. - Well at least I'm not a murderer. Aye, Ben? - Yes? - I'm not a murderer. What would God think about that, aye, Ben? - No. - What do you think God thinks about that, being a murderer, aye? What would your granny-- - Shut up, Luce! Now you lay off him. (thunder rolling) (insects buzzing) (chuckling) (rain falling) (rain falling) Who is this, mate? Your mother? - My gran. - Is she back in Aussie? - Yes. She's dead. All my family's dead. Dead family. (rain falling) She brought me up to be good. (rain falling) - Well, mate. The war's done something to all of us. - It's me. I just wasn't strong enough to pass the test God sent me on. God sent me to the war. I didn't volunteer. Prayed. Prayed. When he felt I needed to be tested, he sent me. He did. I failed him. - We hold rules that, that just don't apply the way they did before. - I can hardly, with the guilt. - Well it's not guilt, mate. It's grief. (thunder rolling) (rain falling) That's a nice photo, isn't it? (insects buzzing) (Ben whimpering) - Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. There's one, it's Ben, it's Ben. It's Ben. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh. Ben, get down, get down. Get down! (yelling) (screaming) - What's the trouble, sir? - Mate of yours, is he, Sargent? - That's right. - Look after him, do you? - He looks after himself. - Well keep him out my way then. (insects buzzing) (gunshot) (animals vocalizing) (gunshots) (animals vocalizing) (gunshot) (gunshot) (gunshot) (gunshots) (hitting) (grunting) (animals vocalizing) (heavy breathing) (grunting) (heavy breathing) (groaning) (thunder rolling) (birds chirping) (waves crashing) - If only I could take Bengall razor to that load he's flaunting. - Just once I'd like to see it. - [Michael] It's not what you got, it's what you do with it. (chuckling) - Yeah. And I'd love to be a fly on the wall. (waves crashing) - Anyone for cricket? - [Michael] Why not, mate? We can see you've got the bat. (laughing) - Glad you noticed, Mike. - If it grows any bigger, we can use you for the wicket. (laughing) (laughing) - What's it like being an actor? (birds chirping) - Well. When you've got the audience right there, you can do anything you want with them. (birds chirping) You can control them. (birds chirping) Cold? - A little. (birds chirping) (heavy breathing) (heavy breathing) (moaning) (heavy breathing) (moaning) Stop. Stop! You're hurting me. (heavy breathing) Stop it! Stop it! (heavy breathing) (moaning) (birds chirping) Was it alright? Will I see you again? - You certainly will. (birds chirping) Well whackle a diddalo. Just in time for tea, beauty. You know I was telling Little Miss Whoop Whoop tonight that I'll have to change my name when I get to Hollywood. Something more swashbuckling like. Rhett, or Erol Coleman. - [Honour] Luce does have a swashbuckling ring to it. - But Daggett sounds more like a sheep's bum. Oh, Benedict. Don't forget to say your prayers. And God bless grandma who brought me up to be such a clean little murderer. - I'm turning in, Sis. - Good night, Matt. Each time you come back from seeing that girl-- - [Luce] Miss Whoop Whoop? - If she upsets you so much, Luce, then don't see her. - Upsets me? Oh Sis, quite the contrary. - Then why so bitter? Huh? (insects buzzing) - I don't know Sis. (insects buzzing) Maybe it's because I didn't have any shoes when I was a kid, and she did. Yeah. Little black patent leather Shirley Temples with straps and black silk bows. - I always hated wearing shoes. - [Luce] My sisters were much prettier than any of the other girls. And prettier than her, too. They didn't have any shoes either. - I always envied anyone who could run around barefoot. - What, even in winter when their feet used to crack and bleed with the cold? - I'm sorry. - I don't want your pity, Sister. - And you don't have it. (insects buzzing) - Well. Before the army grabbed me, I was wearing the best shoes money could buy. It was right after I went off to Sydney to be an actor. Laurence Olivier, stand aside. Sis, I was good. I was really good, you know. I was something special. But I didn't have enough time. By the time I get back, there'll be some smarmy little bastard with a rich father to buy him a discharge out there in my lights. Stealing my limelight. - Sis, I'm feeling crook again. And I think I'm gonna chuck. - Sorry, Luce. I'm sorry, but if I don't get Nugget something, you'll all pay for it later tonight. - Oh, mommy, mommy, mommy, I got a pain in my tummy! (insects buzzing) - Clean it up. You ignorant bastard. - Make me. - If it wasn't for my rank, I'd rub your nose in it. - Go on, captain. Run away and hide behind your pips! You haven't got the guts! (insects buzzing) You stupid drongo. (insects buzzing) (rain falling) (scrubbing) - Oh, good. Good. Matt. Do you know what would really please me? - I'm sorry, Sis, but no tests. If it's imaginary, like they say, why bother? If it's real, brain tumor something, well, I'm gonna die anyway, aye? - Ben. I can do it, mate. (rain falling) (water pouring) - Oh. You'd think I'd be used to the tropics by now. - It gets to everybody after a while. I'd say it'd almost lead to murder. (scraping) - Did it in your own case? - That's my business, Sis. Remember? (rain falling) - You seem to be succeeding with Ben. - Yeah. He would have been a demon soldier. - What makes you say that? - Oh, he reminds me of somebody. Somebody I fought with. Somebody who also relied on me. I thought I was through looking after people. It's a bad habit I've seem to have gotten myself into. - I've never considered it a bad habit. Anyway, he won't be your problem for long. He'll be going home soon. - What'll happen to him then? - I don't know. I mean, I don't think he's capable of living independently of some close unit and yet he's got no one to go back to. I've been trying to have him placed under proper supervision. - Meaning what? - Well, an institution. - A mental asylum? But it'd kill him. - He needs professional help. - He needs somebody he can trust. - [Neil] Sis? Nugget needs you. - Thanks, Neil. (soft piano music) (Ben whimpering) (soft piano music) (birds chirping) - Oh, I didn't get a wink of sleep last night. I never do. It's me insomnia. - You slept last night. - I didn't. - You slept last night. - I never did. - You slept last night. - Shut up. - No. - Give Margaret, Edward, John, and little Sammy, a big hug and a kiss. Your loving husband, Matthew. P.S. I wish you could see this mountain of ours. Somehow it gives me a lot of strength, but not nearly as much as the thought of coming home. - You know, Matt, I think I'll write a letter to your wife. Dear Mrs. Matt, did you know husband was as blind as a bat? (yelling) - Matt, take it easy. Come on, we'll finish the letter inside. Come on, mate. - Where is it? - I'll get the letter, Matt, I'll get it. (laughing) (floorboard creaking) - I never get under your skin, do I? I said I never get under your skin, do I? - Why do you want to? - Because it breaks the God awful monotony. - Why don't you run away and make yourself useful for a change? - Who do you think you are? Don't you ever patronize me. - You know, that sounds like something you had to spout in a play. - There's something about you, isn't there? Our Michael. Sis' darling little blue-eyed boy. But there's something in you that she wouldn't like one bit. And I know what it is. And I know what to do about it. - He said he'd be easier on me if I went along with it. - Bastard. - Hey. You don't understand. He's right about me. He knows. But, I love you, Mike. I love you. - Aren't you finished yet, Michael? Get out, Luce. In my office. I'll see you in my office. What's going on? - Nothing. - What do you mean nothing? - It's alright. He was just doin' a Luce. Honest. (birds chirping) (animals vocalizing) Get down! (gunshot) (animals vocalizing) (heavy breathing) - Attention, Sargent. I said attention! What was going on? Between you and Sargent Wilson? - Nothing, Sis. - Nothing, Sister. And you're lying. Did you make a sexual advance to Sargent Wilson? - Yes. - Why? - An experiment. - You're not the least bit homosexual. - Oh, sweetie. I'm anything. Any time. Young, old, male, female. It's all meat to me. Well that's how I get on, Sis. That's why I'm an X. I could make my CO do anything I wanted, so they had to put me somewhere safe. But you and I both hate playing it safe, don't we? - You're overstepping a mark, Luce. - You're weakening. Only you're obsessed with the wrong man. Well try me, Sis. I'm the best there is. - You just get out of here. Just get out of here! - Well face it. I'm the only real man here. (sighing) - [Colonel] Bring him in. - Sargent Wilson does not belong in Ward X, or any hospital ward for that matter. And to deny him the chance to clear himself is a disgrace to the army. - Oh, come now, Sister. I agree that the circumstances are somewhat unusual. But you're assuming you know more than the army and the doctors put together. - It's a pretty poor show, isn't it, where fight and a highly suspect accusation break up six years of irreproachable army service. - Six years, aye? Obvious lack of promotion, wouldn't you say? - Rank does not make the soldier, nor the man, sir. And if you had spent any time in the field at all, you'd know that there are some with all the qualities of command who refuse promotion so that they can put themselves in the front line with their men. - You're arrogant, Sister. And if you continue to be disrespectful, I'll not only have you removed from Ward X, I'll have you removed from Base 15 all together. Now, get out. - Sister Langrty. You will do well to remember I am I charge of the nursing staff and if you have any problems, then you will come to me. - Yes, matron. - [Matron] You can think about getting this room cleaned up. (laughing) - Well you won't have to worry about matron anymore. We'll be going home in two weeks. It's true. She told me. - Well, well, well, we all know where she gets her information from. It must be true. - Just think, home. I can't wait to introduce Luce to my family. They'll just die. He's gonna be really famous one day. - So you're the girl that comes from the same town as Luce. - That's right. Has he told you about me? - Yes. How well did you know him? - Oh, well I wasn't really allowed to mix with him then. - So, what was he like? - Well he's awfully clever. Although the teachers hated him. They could never pin anything on him. And if they did, he always got back at him somehow. - Sue, um, I think it'd be wise if you stopped seeing him. He's got problems. - Well there's no disgrace in battle fatigue. - Is that what he told you? He hasn't been anywhere near the front lines. He was an orderly. - An orderly? - Sue, stay well away from him. He's a very sick man. - [Sue] Is that an order, captain? - No. - [Sue] Good. (insects buzzing) (whimpering) (chuckling) - Where's the tin, Matt? Two more to go and I win. - Ben, Ben. (insects buzzing) - 20, I win. I won, I won. Sis, I won. - [Honour] That's very good, Ben. - How'd you do that? (stomping) - Michael. - He's supposed to do it by himself, mate. It's a competition. - A competition? - Yeah well the whole idea is you're supposed to do it by yourself. Anyway I would've won... - Listen. I've had a word to Colonel Donaldson about moving you, but I'm sorry, it's no go. Now I thought if you spoke to him-- - I've got nothing to say. - I already had an hour long horror of in me right visual field. - Just don't think about it, Nugget. (insects buzzing) I'm sorry. I'm sorry, it must be the heat. (sobbing) (laughing) (Nugget sobbing) (Luce laughing) (insects buzzing) (Nugget sobbing) - Hm. Your gallery of rogues is complete, Sis. It's not the heat, is it? - [Honour] A touch of the Luce, that's all. - Luce is Luce. He's no different. You've never blamed things on one of us before. - Well I am now. - Well, I think things have changed since Mike arrived. - How? - Well I think you've let him take over. - Oh, rubbish. I'm just trying to help him, that's all. Nothing's changed, Neil. - We take our moods from you, Sis. Even Luce. Why is Michael in with us? - You know better than to discuss another patient with me. - Leave that for Mike, do you? (sighing) - Damn. (waves crashing) (birds chirping) - I suppose she's tired of us. It's a wonder she's stuck us for so long. - If Sis was fed up with us, I'd be the first to know. Now I reckon she's coming down with something. - [Ben] She's too good of a woman to get tired of us, Nugget. - She's frustrated. - [Matt] Well X is a pretty frustrating place, that's for sure. - Not that way, you blinking idiot. She's a woman. And she's not getting any. Anyway. I got a more important woman to worry about. If you get my drift, Ben. - Yes. (laughing) (waves crashing) - What do you think? - Why don't you blokes lay off her? Whatever's wrong is her business, not yours. Just leave her alone. - You haven't changed one scarrot. Making me think you were some sort of a hero when you nothing more than an orderly. - You believed what you wanted to believe. - Look who's talking. - You thought my being an actor was pretty good, though, didn't ya? Well didn't ya? - Yeah, but they're gonna want soldiers when we go back home, Luce, not actors. - Well what's wr-- Well I'm just as good as any of them out at the front. Well I can go out there and stand up and not shit myself. Look, I'm as good as any of 'em. I'm better. I'm the best. Look. I was in demand. That's because I was the best. That's what I am, the best. Yeah. I'm the best! You bitch, I'm the best. I'm the best, you bitch, I am the best. (sobbing) (insects buzzing) Why did you queer my pitch with Little Miss Whoop Whoop? - Did I? - You know bloody well you did, you bitch. - Ranting of me isn't gonna change the way Sue Pedder feels. - I'm gonna get you back, Sister. You see, I've found something you think belongs to you and I'm gonna take great pleasure in destroying it. (insects buzzing) Bitch! - [Ben] She's not! - [Luce] Stupid bitch! - She's a good woman! - [Luce] She is a bitch! - She cares about us! - She doesn't care about anyone except Sargent bloody hero Wilson! - [Ben] Don't say it, Luce! - The bitch is in love with a shirt lifting pansy! - No, get your filthy-- - He's a queen you stupid drunk. I read it in his papers! (yelling) - [Ben] No, Luce! - He was accused of buckling his R.S.M. (screaming) Murderer! Murderer! Remember that, Benedict? That's the sound of your gun killing innocent people. (yelling) (screaming) - Luce! Get out of here! (Nugget sobbing) It's alright. (Nugget sobbing) (insects buzzing) - [Luce] Stupid bitch! (insects buzzing) - [Honour] Luce should be back by now. Does anyone know where he is? - Who cares? - [Ben] He lied. - What's the matter, Ben? - It's wrong. It's all wrong, he lied. - What's all wrong, Ben? - [Ben] All of it. I said this all a long time ago. - [Matt] You shouldn't let him get to you Ben. - Well can't you see that he's evil, Matt? - Yes, I can, but-- - I'm going to look for him. - Come on, mate, open the game. - I'm black. - No mate, you're always white. - Well I wanna be black, mate, alright? - Alright mate. But it's my advantage. (Nugget barfing) (coughing) - [Matt] Nugget. - Matt. Come and have a chat in my room. - [Matt] Well it's a bit late, Neil. - Yeah I know, but we all seem on edge tonight. Listen, what's black and white, yet pure gold inside? (tapping) (insects buzzing) - Michael. I didn't know there were children there, Michael. You believe I didn't know that? - Yes, mate, I believe you. Come on. Come on, open the game, come on. - Yes, mate. Yeah, mate. I'm black, mate. (insects buzzing) I'm black, mate. I'm black. (insects buzzing) - Luce? (insects buzzing) (clinking) - Cheers. - Here's mud in your eye. (sighing) Oh, it's heaven. - It's been too long. What happened tonight to upset Ben? - Oh, bloody Luce. Just put me in a room with that man and turn all the lights off. - Oh, he's always picking on Ben. - Yeah, well tonight he was raving on about Sis and Mike. - Well what about Mike? - He reckons Mike's queer. - Mike? - Have you ever heard anything so stupid in all your life? He reckons he read it in Mike's papers. - Bunk! Not Mike. No matter what his papers say. Or what Luce says. Here Matt old son, have some more. - Luce? Luce? (insects buzzing) (animals vocalizing) Luce? (insects buzzing) (animals vocalizing) (cracking) Luce? Luce? (insects buzzing) (animals vocalizing) - Come on Ben, old son. Bed time at the sack, aye? - I'll be alright, Michael. (insects buzzing) - You and Ben. Come and have a drink with an old man. - I do not drink, Neil. - Oh, come on. Have a drink with the son of the great Parkinson. Ruthless old bastard. - It's bad for you Neil. - Oh come on mate, no wowzers tonight. It'll do you good. - It'll do us all good. - Good. Okay. (insects buzzing) (Ben laughing) (Ben laughing) (insects buzzing) - You reckon Sis knows we're all in love with her? - Not in love, just love. - She's the only woman whose footsteps I know. If Patricia walked in here, well I can't remember. - [Ben] You know matron? - [Matt] Matron's not a woman Ben. - [Neil] Do you think she knows? - Oh mate, I don't know. I think whatever, she'll always love her nursing best. - Oh well what would you know? There's not a woman born wouldn't offer marriage over a career. - [Michael] Why? - They live for love. - [Michael] What about duty? - Duty? Ignorance got us in, duty kept us in. It's an obsession. The most indecent of all. - [Ben] There's nothing indecent about Sis. - Great, right. You'll never understand her. See, she and I come from the same background. I know what she wants. To Sis. - To Sis. (insects buzzing) (alarm ringing) (insects buzzing) (insects buzzing) (birds chirping) (snoring) (insects buzzing) (snoring) - Have you managed to be sick yet, Nugget? - A while ago. Michael gave me a new bowl. - Well I'll make you a cup of tea in a minute. - Thanks. (snoring) (insects buzzing) (Neil singing) ♪ If the banyon should ask you ♪ ♪ Never say no ♪ - Do you wanna get us all court marshaled? Where did that come from? - Chinstrap. - Well if he had no more sense than to give it to you, you would have had more sense than to take it. Now, where's Michael and Luce? - [Neil] Mike went for a shower. No fun at a party. - And Luce? - [Ben] He can rot. - [Neil] I'll find him. - In your state, you couldn't find yourself. Ben, you get to bed. And you get this mess cleaned up. - It's alright. (insects buzzing) (birds chirping) - Come on. Come on, little boy. Come on, Sis' blue-eyed little boy. Come on. Come on, little boy. It's alright. I know all about you. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. - No! No! No! No! - Help! - [Michael] No! No! (grunting) (choking) - Break it up! I said break it up! (Ben yelling) - Michael! Michael! (rapid breathing) Michael, Michael, Michael. - Neil, will you take care of Luce? - [Ben] Michael, Michael. - Ben? - Michael, Michael. (heavy breathing) - Are you sober enough to go? Ben, you help Neil. Come on. - Michael, Michael, Michael. Michael. Michael. Michael. (whimpering) - It's alright. It's alright. (staggered breathing) Take some deep breaths. Deep breaths. That's it. Take some deep breaths. (Michael breathing deeply) Deep breaths. That's it. That's it. (staggered breathing) Alright. You're alright. That's it. That's it. (insects buzzing) (clock ticking) (insects buzzing) Lie down. (insects buzzing) (door opening) (door knob rattling) (doorknob rattling) (insects buzzing) (birds chirping) (sensual jazzy music) Oh. (sensual jazzy music) (insects buzzing) (sensual piano music) (insects buzzing) (sensual piano music) (insects buzzing) (sensual piano music) (kissing) (moaning) (birds chirping) Good morning. - [Man] Morning Sister. (birds chirping) (birds chirping) - Alright, rise and shine. Tea's ready. And you'll find something for your hangovers on my desk. (birds chirping) Where's Luce? I said where's Luce? (slow piano music) (slow, dramatic music) (dripping) (Honour whimpering) (dramatic music) (Honour whimpering) Oh god. Oh. (hard knocking) (hard knocking) (hard knocking) (hard knocking) - Alright! I'm coming. - [Honour] Colonel Donaldson. Colonel Donaldson. (hard knocking) There's been an accident. (hard knocking) (grunting) Please, would you come quickly? (birds chirping) There's been an accident. Quickly. - Geez. (birds chirping) - I caught Sargent Daggett in the bathhouse last night attempting to molest Sargent Wilson. Now I imagine he became remorseful and guilt ridden and killed himself. There was a definite sexual motive. His genitals being-- - I've got eyes, Sister. Why didn't you report to me, immediately? - I didn't think you'd appreciate being disturbed at two o'clock in the morning, sir. - Then why didn't you have someone guarding the ward? Or a relief nurse? - I didn't think there was any need, as um, I removed Sargent Wilson from the ward. - [Colonel Donaldson] You removed Sargent Wilson from the ward? - He was in severe emotional shock, sir. I thought it best to treat him in my own quarters. - So Sargent Wilson was with you all night? - Yes, sir. All night. - And you were with him, all night? - Why yes, sir. (birds chirping) - You've made a proper mess of this, Sister. From start to finish. And I'm gonna make a mind of this to see that you get exactly what you deserve. - Well thank you sir, however I consider the direct cause of this entire affair to be two bottles of whiskey. And if I discover the brainless fool who gave Captain Parkinson that whiskey, a man you consider to be emotionally unstable, then I'll make it my business to see that he gets exactly what he deserves. (birds chirping) (water flowing) (clearing throat) - I understand that some of you men may have witnessed an unpleasant incident last night, involving Sargents Daggett and Wilson. - Yes, sir. Luce tried to molest Mike. Sister Langtry fetched us and we broke it up. - Disgusting, filthy. - And what about you? - Ben? - Evil. He's evil. - You? - Never saw a thing, sir. - Oh. Oh. - Captain? What happened after you put a stop at the incident? - I suggested Sister Langtry remove Sargent Wilson from the ward to her quarters. - [Colonel Donaldson] Sargent Daggett was found dead in the bath house. - Dead? - Good riddance. - Probably Christmas has come at last. - He dirtied everything up. - How did he die, sir? - [Ben] Dead, dead. - The Japanese call it harakiri, I understand. - And who found him, sir? - Sister Langtry. (birds chirping) - I'm sorry. (birds chirping) - They knew. They knew he was dead. - No, I don't think so, sir. They were just trying to get on your nerves. You shouldn't let them. It only makes them worse. - When I want your advice, madam, I'll ask for it. - Oh god, what have I done? - It's not your fault. He wanted to get at me. - I shouldn't have been here. I should have been in the ward. - Thanks, that's quite a compliment. - Sis, I didn't mean that. - Sis? It's not even Honour now? - Look. - You know, Luce said he'd destroy us. He seems to have done quite a job. I'll take you back to the ward. Where you belong. - Had he ever tried it before? - Well, I don't, yes, once. But I mean, it didn't go anywhere. I don't believe Sargent Daggett was homosexual, he was, he was a troublemaker that's all. - [Man] Are your own leanings that way inclined? - No, sir. - Your R.S.M. accused you of making an advance to him. - That was a bloody lie, sir! (birds chirping) (insects buzzing) - What did you tell him? - Nothing. - Good, you can't say anything. You're responsible. - I know. (birds chirping) (insects buzzing) I know why I'm doing it, mate. Why are you doing it? - We all gotta stick together. Look after each other. There's no one else to do it. - There's Sis. - No, Sis must never know. This is strictly between us. (birds chirping) (insects buzzing) - Thank you for saying it was your idea to remove Michael from the ward. How did you know that, have you a cigarette? - Of course. - How did you know I'd taken him to my quarters? - Oh, just a feeling. You forget how much I've improved since you came to X. - I've let you all down. I'm sorry. - Oh, we ask too much of you Sis. Well let's face it. You ask too much of yourself. You were the one who set the standards. (footsteps approaching) - You wanted to see me, Sis? - Yes. (birds chirping) (insects buzzing) - Oh, sorry. I'll get out of your way. Sit down. (birds chirping) (insects buzzing) - The verdict's in. An acute burst of mania, followed by an acute depressive state, resulting in suicide. Oh for God's sake, will you get that bloody look off your face? What do you think I'm gonna do? Beg for a repeat performance? You've been exonerated. We've all been exonerated. Dismissed, Sargent. (birds chirping) (insects buzzing) - I'm gonna go back to school and get me matriculation, and then go on and do medicine. Aye, Neil? - [Neil] Whatever you want, Nugget. What about you, Matt? - I'm an accountant, but I've got to be able to see. The army might give me a pension. They reckon there's nothing wrong with my eyes. - [Neil] Cigarette? - Thanks. What the hell am I gonna do? - [Neil] I'll see you and your family are taken care of. - I've never taken charity in my life, Neil. - It's not charity, mate. We made a pact. - Mike's got his full share. You make up my share. That way we're even. (birds chirping) (insects buzzing) (birds chirping) (insects buzzing) (hitting) (birds chirping) (insects buzzing) - Hypocrite! It's your fault he's dead! You never stopped persecuting him! In your quarters with Sargent Wilson! You killed him! - Shut up! - [Sue] You killed him! (yelling) (sobbing) - Oh. - I know, I know. I know. (sobbing) (birds chirping) - Sister, we're out of powdered milk. Can I go down to stores? - I'll come with you. - No it's okay. I can do it by myself. - Yes, Matt? - Could you please make arrangements for me to have those tests? - Yes, yes, of course. What made you change your mind? - Well Neil says we should learn to stand on our own two feet. Make plans for the future. - Good. - Sis? (birds chirping) (insects buzzing) (people chattering) (car approaching) - Well. So you'll be straight next week, aye? Bed pan alley. Female patients again. (laughing) Beds, beds, beds, bed. You wait, it would be just my luck to land Garney Uransteads. Mental patients are so much easier. - What's the thing they say about mothers, Sal, that they try to hold the family together when the natural reasons for its existence aren't there anymore? - Honour, they forget us. They forget us. And we have to move on, too. (birds chirping) - I'm gonna tell her! - You can't. - [Michael] I can! - You can't tell her without our consent. - No. - Matt? - No. - And we don't give it. - Look, I've taken the biggest share because I'm the only one who can. Because it's mostly my fault, but I'll be a buggered if I let her go and feel guilty about it. - [Neil] We made a pact. - You made a pact. (birds chirping) (bed springs creaking) (waves crashing) (birds chirping) - It came too quickly. I'm not ready. - I would never have met anyone like you back home. You would've mixed with fellas like Neil. Not blokes like me. - It doesn't matter now, does it? - My house, my friends. Even the sort of life I lead. They don't seem to fit with you. - Michael. You don't love a life. You love a man, and you make a life. (birds chirping) - I'm taking Ben with me back to the farm. - Why? - [Michael] I owe it to him. - Oh. Well come off it. - [Michael] Luce didn't kill himself. Ben killed him. If I'm around to look after him, he'll never do anything like that again. (birds chirping) - No, no. I don't believe you. - He did it for me. If I'd just been in the ward that night. If I just showed him I was alright. Luce would still be alive. He thought Luce had somehow broken me and, I guess he did. Anyway. I couldn't expect you to share my life looking after Ben. (birds chirping) - No. You can't, you can't isolate him on a farm for God's sake. It'll limit him further. He'll get worse. - Oh, we made a pact. Ben doesn't go to a lunatic asylum, and Neil will see Matt and Nugget right. - All of you made a pact? Or just you and Neil? - We did it to protect you. He is my responsibility. You of all people must understand that. (waves crashing) (birds chirping) Good bye, Honour. (waves crashing) (birds chirping) (engine idling) - [Neil] I've got you all to myself at last. - Have you really? You'll miss the truck. - I'll catch the next one. You know. - Thank God Michael had the decency to tell me. - Michael. Always Michael. Don't you see? That's why Luce died. Because you fell for good old sane Mike. Oh, he never hit away or blubbered with self pity. And you loved him for it. We really needed you. You turned your back on us. You left us for him. See? I'm holding you a lot harder than Ben probably had to hold Luce. And you won't have any bruises either. - Whose idea was it? For Ben to go with Michael? - Well someone had to make you both realize you weren't meant to happen. You simply lost your sense of perspective, that's all. (slapping) All I did was appeal to his sense of duty. Good bye, Honour. Don't forget. If you need anything, I'm in the Melbourne phone book. (birds chirping) (engine idling) (van revving) - Michael!
