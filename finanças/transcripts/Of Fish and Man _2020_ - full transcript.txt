Are you sure? And what if I do silly things? What kind of silly things? Then it's not the teachers that do it it's the mums. Not too far. Milla. Mummy, I saw the lion, the lion. - Judith? Is she here? - She's in the village. No, keep it. So you're the new guy? Sami. Gabriel. About time too, before she works herself to death. Just like her father, he was exactly the same. Out here there's nothing else to do. I'm going to get you. You cheeky monkey. - Keep going. Mummy. - No, the concert's over. Hoppla... Roll over. - Sleep well and dream sweet... - ...of cheese and pigs' feet. Mummy, when I'm grown up I'll marry Gabriel. That didn't take long. Can I visit him in the forest hut tomorrow? Want one too? No thanks. Oh... of course. Respect. It's not exactly hard out here in the sticks. Still, it's pretty impressive. End of the ride. How far is it from here? No idea. 10, 15 kilometres. - That's rubbish. - I'm telling you, Mummy. - It was just a dream. - But I saw him. Come on, finish your meat. Who? The heron. He was right next to my bed last night. They don't come inside people's houses. - They do! - Where's your meat? Gabu. I didn't want to come, honestly. They'll beat me to death. They've given me 5 days. Please. I'm in my probation period, David. How much do you think I earn here? I'll pay you back. Listen to me: I'm going to quit everything. I promise. As soon as I have the cash, you'll be rid of me... right away. I'm your brother! - Gabi. - You piss me off, man. You've always taken the easy way out. Always. Fuck you, man! Hey. Judith. - I hope it hasn't reached the tipping point. - What? A bit of fungus is normal, but this is an epidemic. We have to treat them, or they'll all catch it. See? These ones have to go. You do it. David. David. David. Airways... bleeding... circulation... Cut the crap. - You used to think it was funny. - Here. I'm taking you to Moutier, and from there you can get a taxi and go home. On the way to Biel, near the tunnel, there's a petrol station. Hardly any buildings, remote. You're crazy. Why not? David, go to the police. Go to the police. I went to jail for you. I almost died! There's this ship in Spain. I can apply, this is my chance. You always said I just have to want it. And now you're leaving me in the lurch? I don't agree with this. Did you hear me? No. I'm serious. Two guys gave her bubble gum. I have no idea who they were. Milla, stop it. Give me the gum. Milla. Did they ask you anything? If you don't know someone, you don't take anything from them. You don't know what they want. What do they want? Let's do it like this: Next time, you just say no and you run away. Promise? Cross your heart. He has a tattoo as well. Yes. We'll get ourselves some of that gum. I want one too. When will we get it? He's much too heavy. His wet fur. He's pulling me down. I can't save him. I'm calling and calling. And no one comes. So the teacher gives her a smack on the bum. She runs home, goes to the mirror pulls down her pants and has a look. You know what she says? - Hmmm? - I knew it: Split! All done? Come on, get dressed. Daddy. Milli... Michu, we're running a bit late. And I have to stop off, I promised Milla something. We've already eaten, Ella has choir practice. Daddy, I know a joke. What do you know? A yolk? No, Daddy, a joke. What's that, something you eat? Hey Milla, Mummy hasn't eaten yet, has she? - You don't need to go to any trouble... - I know, you'll eat leftovers. I want to tell you the joke. Go ahead, I'm listening. So the teacher gives her a smack on the bum. No, they don't smack you at school. Are you sure? And what if I do silly things? What kind of silly things? Then it's not the teachers that do it, it's the mums. Not too far. Milla. Mummy, I saw the lion, the lion. Milla! Do something! Hello. Judith... Gabriel. I'm at the hospital in Delemont. Milla's being operated. Please come. I'm sure it'll be ok. Children have guardian angels. Remember when I got caught in that river vortex? How old was I? Maybe six. Mum freaked out. What the hell have you gotten into. Go on then, she needs you. Monsieur, can I help you? No. No, you can't just... Judith. I'll be in the kitchen, if... You're staying now...? Judith, you need to eat. Judith sometimes sent me photos or videos... I hadn't seen her in ages. She was telling me a joke, on the way over to our place. She meant so much to all of us. Let's get out of here. When's the handover? When's the handover? Which handover? Dammit. Tomorrow. What time? Where? Tomorrow evening. Gabriel? I'll drive you. I'm coming. What are you up to? The police called. I need to go by. Will you come along? I'd be grateful. And? Who does a thing like that? A lousy asshole. You're warm. I'll drive you home. Hey, I still need a signature. Here please. Thanks. Bye. Hello. The store lady is bringing drinks and everything else. And Michu says Ella will bake those puff pastry things. Look... - Are you coming? - No. Hey, Ella knows someone who's in a care team. Do you want to talk to him? Don't you think that... Come with me, you need to get away from here. Away? Yes... no idea... just a few days. Take your mind off things. Why not? I'm not finished here. Gabriel? Hello? Would you do me a favour? I'm worried that she's suddenly going to snap. Would you look after her? I don't think I'm suited. Keep an eye on her. so she doesn't do anything rash... you know... Dammit, David, where's my motorbike? Man, you can't just... David. Yes... Yes, I see... OK... Thank you. Bye. Wait. I'm coming too. Nothing, the police know nothing. Shall I? Yes please. I'll be back in a second. This is the one you like, made by our own... bees. Thank you. Judith. That was a lovely memorial for the little one. If you need anything, either of you, Gabriel... You know that we're here for you. Thank you. Where are you going now? There's no point to this. Of course there is. Thank you for coming with me. Hello? Hello. The robbery. I was there... with my child. I have to talk with you. Please open up. It wasn't my fault. I didn't say it was. We were taught not to play the hero. Just hand everything over. I did it as fast as I could. I'm sorry. This is getting us nowhere. It's my third robbery. Why is it always me? - I had an injection held to my neck once. - When? Did they ever find the guys? Can you tell me anything about the man... ...his voice. Did he say anything? He must have said something. They're coming soon. Who? He's off his rocker. You don't know anything. Hello. Did you remember anything else? Who's that? Your contacts? What... my contacts? They must know something. I severed all my ties. I told you why I'm out here, away from it all. Spare some change for the homeless shelter? - OK, have a nice day. - Hey, wait a minute. There was a robbery at a petrol station. Are you a cop? My daughter was killed there. Do you know anything about it? Can you ask around? I have to know who did it. Yes, I can try. I'll give you my number. I'm Tami. Judith. Hey, Tami. Thank you. - I wouldn't give my number to anyone here. - Why not? I'll find him this way. And what will you do, when you've found him? You want to put him in there...? Get in. Say something. Gabriel. You're crazy. It was an accident. What happened was an accident... ...an accident. You took him along to the junkies? Do you know what that's like for him? He quit everything with Methadone and anyway, he came along voluntarily. He did it for you, that's not voluntarily. It's easy to judge from afar. I'm sorry. I just want to help you. But let's talk about you, how are you doing? What is it you want to hear? I can't remember. Is that it? Remember what? The robbery? I could always see or hear Milla, even when she wasn't actually with me. A little noise behind me, her on her tricycle... I could feel her and smell her... She smelled so good... Aren't you taking your motorbike? I thought you'd go to the fÃªte afterwards. No, it's fine, I'll come with you. About yesterday. I'm sorry. I didn't think about how seeing that scene might still be hard for you. Judith. Look, we've got a new litter. Milla can choose one, aren't they cute? Yes, thanks. I'm sorry, I'll be right with you. Thanks. Sophie and I used to have a ritual. Before we drove off in the car, my father always had to wait for one minute. It annoyed him. But it was obvious to us, that the accident that might have happened, wouldn't happen to us now. I even rushed her, told her to hurry up. Milla tended to forget the time. We often argued about it. But surely a child is allowed to... forget the time... live in the moment. If we'd arrived a minute later... - just one minute. - You're not to blame. I'll pay. Thank you. Enjoy. Hey, you got a problem? Fuck off, man... go home... What's wrong with you? Hey. Are you ok? Oh, shit. Was that... actually... your wife and child? I'm sorry. Have you ever done anything so horrible, that you couldn't tell anyone? Gabriel, where are you? Pick up. It's already after 9. You've got a job to do. Gabriel. Judith? It was Gabriel's motorbike at the petrol station. Milla recognized it, she tried to tell me, but I didn't get it. Have you gone totally mad? That's just a child's drawing. There are other motorbikes like that. But not with that horn. Didn't Gabriel have a visitor? Maybe he took the motorbike. - Who? - No idea. Unfortunately, he wasn't wearing a helmet. He sustained severe traumatic brain injuries, with bleeding in the right cerebral hemisphere. Will he survive? It's too early for a prognosis. We have to wait now. He needs a guardian angel. I'm sorry. - Where are you? - Judith, I listened to your message. - I couldn't... - Where are you? In Delemont, at the hospital. My brother had a motorbike accident. Ah. You have a brother. Did you lend him your motorbike? Did I what? I sensed something wasn't right. It all adds up. The motorbike, the lion, and you... behaving so oddly. - Judith, listen, I... - You helped him, didn't you? What for? It's him. He did it, didn't he? What's he called? He's covering for him. Would you betray me? Get out of my way. He's going to die anyway. He'll get his just deserts. Dammit, listen to me! Oh, have it your way! Hey. They told me to walk around a lot. Up the stairs, down the stairs. That'll speed things up. But she needs a bit more time. I was thinking of you. How... How are you doing? Um... hey. I want to know everything.
