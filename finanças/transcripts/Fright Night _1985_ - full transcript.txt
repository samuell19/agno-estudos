What was that? Just a child of the night, John. Come. Sit here beside me on the verandah. It's chilly out here. Oh, no, it isn't. It's beautiful. I love the night so. I've never seen you look so beautiful before, Nina. So pale... So... Luminescent. So... Yes? Your lips are so red. Are they? Would you like to kiss them? Why are you looking at me so strangely, Nina? It's not you, Jonathan. Your neck! Has anyone ever told you it looks beautiful. No. Come. Lay your head on my breast. Stop, you creature of the night! Who are you who interrupts my nightly feeding? I am Peter Vincent, vampire killer! No! No! Keep away! Keep away from me! No. And now your host, Peter Vincent. Fright Night! This is Peter Vincent, bringing you Fright Night theater. Charley, Peter Vincent's on. Forget Peter Vincent. But you love him. But I love you more. Tonight's journey into horror is Blood Castle. I think if would Charley, stop it. - I know it will. - It is one of my favorites for a very good reason. I star in it. Fright Night! Charley, I said stop it! Jesus, Amy, give me a break! We've been going together almost a year, and all I ever hear is, "Charley, stop it." I'm sorry, Amy. Me, too. I'm just scared, that's all. Let's get into bed. You mean it? Charley... I'm ready. Amy, you're not gonna believe this. There are two guys out in the yard and I think they're carrying a coffin. We have pledged ourselves to evil. Sure. And they're on the moors, right? Amy, I'm serious. So am I. Do you wanna make love or not? Amy, quick come here. You've got to see this! Amy! Okay, maybe it wasn't a coffin, but I did see two guys carrying something into that house. I don't understand you. First you want to make love, and then you don't. Amy? Charley? What's wrong? Uh, nothing, mom. Come in here, you two. Are you kids having a lover's spat? No, mom, nothing like that. Well, there's nothing wrong with it. It says right here that the divorce rate is 76% higher among couples who don't argue before marriage. Mom, we're in high school. Well, never hurts to plan ahead. Oh, Amy, will you remind your mother we are playing poker at her house this weekend. Yes, Mrs. Brewster. Well, good night, Charley. Yeah, good night. Good night, Mrs. Brewster. Goodnight, Amy. Thanks for helping Charley with his homework. Any time. See you tomorrow, Charley? Charley, that wasn't very nice. Not walking Amy to the front door. Mom, there are people next door. Oh, I guess the new owner is moving in. What new owner? Didn't I tell you? Bob Hopkins said he'd finally got rid of the place. Who'd he sell it to? I don't know, some fellow who fixes up houses for a living. Supposed to be very attractive, though. I just hope whoever he is, he knows what he's getting into with this house. And now for the local news. A man was found murdered tonight behind the rail road yards. Details are pending, awaiting notification of next of kin. Thank you, Mr. Smith. Have a good weekend. That bastard! Why didn't he tell us he was going to spring a pop quiz? Well, that's the point to a pop quiz, Brewster, to surprise you. Thanks, Teach. Hey, Amy. Amy! Did she finally find out what you're really like? Buzz off, Evil. Call me anything you want. You're the one failing Trig, not me. Is this 99 Oak? No. No, that's next door. Oh. Thanks. Hey, mom? Yeah? I'm in here. Have you seen the new guy next door yet? No, but I did hear he's got a live-in carpenter. My luck. He's probably gay. No. I don't think so. Why? What do you know that I don't? Oh, nothing. I've got to study. I'll see you later. Study? You? Hi. Hi! Look, I'm really sorry about the other night. Oh, it was my fault. Not yours. It was? Look, Amy, I love you. I never want to fight with you again, okay? I'm glad we're getting this straightened out. I've been miserable the last two days. ...the second murder in two days. The second victim, whose body was found early this morning, was a known prostitute. ...not talking to you on the phone. Charley, are you listening to me? The badly mutilated corpse was found under the north creek bridge by the old mill. As yet, the police have no leads. You know what I heard on the police band last night? What? That wasn't the only murder. The second in two days. And get this... Both of them had their heads chopped off. Can you believe it? You're sick. Hey! Charley? Oh, you're so cool, Brewster! I can't stand it! Hey, kid! What are you doing? Nothing. Oh, yeah? Well, just make sure it stays that way, kid. Mom, you got to get up! Mom, I can't believe what's happening next door. What, what, what? He has fangs! The guy who bought the house has fangs. Oh, fangs. That's lovely Charley! I have to get up at 7:00. Charley? You forgot something. Charley. Charley. What are you... This microwave never melts marshmallows right. Drink that. Mom, I don't need hot cocoa. I didn't have a nightmare. They did kill a girl over there. How late did you stay up studying? Mom, I'm not sick! The guy did have fangs, and a bat did fly over my head. And a second later he stepped out of the shadows. Don't you see what that means? Wait let me guess. What? He's a vampire. A What? A Vampire! Damn it, haven't you listened to anything I have said? Charley, is this some sort of a trick to get me back? Forget it. I'm going to the police. Charley, you can't go to the police with a story like that. They'll lock you up. All right, then I won't tell them he's a vampire. But I'll tell them about the two women. Charley! Charley! You sure about this now? Yes? Mr. Dandrige? I'm his roommate, Billy Cole. Lieutenant Lennox, homicide. Mind if we come in? No, come on in. Quite a place you have here. Yeah, we're restoring it. Where is Mr. Dandrige? He's away on business. Is there anything I can help with? A murder occurred last night. Charley lives next door, thinks he saw the victim in this house. Jerry and I were the only people here. That's a lie. He carried her body out in a plastic bag. What do you say to that, Mr. Cole? The kid's crazy, officer. I took some bags of trash out last night. - Amy. - Let me show you. The bag I saw had a body in it. Not trash. You actually see the body, Charley? No, but... I'll show you the bags I put in the garbage. Okay, let's see them. Look I can prove he's lying! Look in the basement. What's down there, Charley? Yes, Charley. What's down there? Obviously, the boy's made a mistake. A coffin. I saw them carry it in. What? You'll find Jerry Dandrige in it, sleeping the sleep of the undead! What are you saying? He's a vampire. I saw him in that room last night. He had fangs, and he bit her neck. For heaven's sake! Come on. We can't leave like this! I've got a coffin for you. Lieutenant, please, please listen to me. Jerry Dandrige is a vampire. Sure, and I'm Dirty Harry. Now let me tell you something, kid. If I ever catch your ass at the station again, I'm throwing it in jail forever! Lieutenant, please. Just listen to me. I know its crazy, but... Lieutenant! Oh, my God! Evil! Evil! Evil! To what do I owe this dubious pleasure? The vampire knows I know about him, or he will tonight. What are you talking about? A vampire lives next door to me. He'll kill me unless I protect myself. What? Evil, I can't explain. Tell me how to protect myself. Very funny. I'm not kidding. Tell me what to do. Don't call me Evil! Why should I help you? I've got eight bucks. Help me and it's yours. Far be it for me to turn down a fool's money. Now... Where and when do you expect the vampire to attack? In my bedroom tonight. Start With this. But... You must have total faith in it for it to work. Put links of garlic around your neck and hang some from your window. If he comes for you, that will be the way. Then there's holy water, but a priest has to say a blessing over it first. That's it? I'm afraid so. Your best protection now, Charles, is that a vampire cannot enter your house without being invited by the rightful owner first. Are you sure? Positive! Thank you. Charley, could you come down here? There's someone I'd like you to meet. Yeah, mom. Charley, this is our neighbor, Jerry Dandrige. Hello, Charley. Well, Charley, don't be rude. Shake hands. What's he doing here? I invited him for drinks. What? I invited him over. Why? What's wrong? Afraid I'd never come without being invited? You're right. Now that I've been made welcome, I'll probably drop by quite a bit. In fact, anytime I feel like it. With your mother's kind permission, of course. Oh, anytime. It's so nice that someone interesting has finally moved into the neighborhood. Charley, are you all right? Yeah, mom, I'm fine. I've got to get back to my Trig. Nice to meet you, Charley. See you. Soon. We shouldn't wake your mother. Then I'd have to kill her, too. Right? Do you realize how much trouble you've caused me? Spying on me, almost disturbing my sleep this afternoon, telling policemen about me! You deserve to die, boy. Of course, I could give you something I don't have. A choice. Forget about me, Charley. Forget about me, and I'll forget about you. What do you say, Charley? Fool. Charley? Charley! Charley. I can't open this door. Charley! Charley! Charley, can you hear me? Charley, is that you? Charley, my door is stuck. Charley. Charley! Charley. Charley, what's going on? Nothing. I just had a nightmare. I had one last night! I was at this white sale. I suddenly realized I was naked... What's that? Raccoons. Go back to sleep. What about your nightmare? Do you want a valium? No, I'm fine now. Honest. I start night shift tomorrow. Three o'clock in the morning. It's bad for my complexion. Night, Mom. I know you're there, Charley. I see you. What's the matter, Charley? Scared? You started this, Charley, and I'm going to finish it. I just destroyed your car, Charley, but that's nothing compared to what I'm going to do to you... Tomorrow night. And once again, your host, Peter Vincent. Good evening, horror fans. Did you know there are a lot of people who do not believe in vampires? Well, I do. Because I know they exist. I have fought them in all their guises. Man, wolves, bats. And I have always won! That is why they call me the great vampire killer. Watch me do it. Go, Peter. Mr. Vincent. Could I talk to you? It's very, very important. What do you want me to sign? Pardon me? You do want my autograph, don't you? No. I was curious about what you said last night on TV, you know, about believing in vampires. What about it? Were you serious? Oh, absolutely. Unfortunately, none of your generation seems to be. What? I have just been fired because nobody wants to see vampire killers any more. All they want are demented madmen hacking up young virgins. If you will excuse me... I believe in vampires. That's nice. If only there had been more of you, my ratings might have been higher. I have one living next door to me. Would you help me kill him? Pardon me? Remember the murder of that girl? Yes. The guy next door to me did it. He's a vampire. If this is a joke, I'm not amused. I am not joking. I am deadly serious. Oh, well. If you will excuse me... Mr. Vincent, you have to believe me. I'm telling the truth. You just said you believe in vampires. I lied. Please! Leave me alone. You have to listen to me. The vampire tried to kill me last night and trashed my car when he didn't succeed. He's going to be back after me tonight. And if I don't get help he's gonna kill me. - Mr. - Vincent, please! Listen to me. No! Wait! Mr. Vincent, wait! What are you doing here? What about you? I thought you just dumped him. None of your business. You do like him! Anybody home? Hi! Wow! What's all this for? Self-defense. Not that I'll need it. He'll be dead before nightfall. Who will be? Dandrige. I am waiting for the guy he lives with to leave and then I am going to go next door to find his coffin and then pound this through his heart. That's murder, Charley. You can't murder a vampire, Amy. They're dead, remember? Listen. Listen. I just taped this. Amy! What are we going to do? This is just like Fright Night. Now for the 2:00 news. Another body of a woman was discovered early this morning in the back of a Sheridan... See that? I don't have any choice. Somebody has to stop him. Charley, it's going to be dangerous going into that house all alone, isn't it? I mean, you're gonna need all the help you can get, right? Somebody like Peter Vincent, for instance? - Yeah! - I tried him already. Well, why don't you let us try again before you do anything. There's not enough time, Amy! What if you go into that house alone and he gets you? Who's gonna stop him then? Yeah, then he'll be able to suck his way through the entire town. But it wouldn't be much of a loss. Charley, it's going to be dark soon. You don't want to go into that house then, do you? No. You're right there. All right, we'll try him again. Great! Now, you promise you're not gonna do anything till you hear from us, okay? Okay. Come on. Amy. You don't believe me, do you? I love you, Charley. Hey, Amy, come on! Yes? Mr. Vincent, could we talk to you for a moment? Oh, well, I'm afraid now is not the best time. Please. It's very important. If you would just wait there for one moment, I'll... Um... Come in! Now, what can I do for you? An autograph, perhaps, or perhaps an interview for your school newspaper? I'm afraid this is much more important. Really? What could be more important than my autograph? Saving a boy's life. Oh, yes. I can see where that could be more important. Perhaps you would care to explain. You remember a fruitcake kid named Charley Brewster? He said he came to see you. No. He's the one that believes a vampire is living next door to him. Oh, yes. You know, he is insane. Oh, my dear, I do hope he's not a friend of yours. Yeah, she's got the hots for the creep. Amy! We need your help to stop him, Mr. Vincent. See, he really does believe his next door neighbor is a vampire and he's planning to kill him. Yeah. With a stake through the heart. Are you two serious? Your friend needs a psychiatrist, not a vampire killer. Please, Mr. Vincent. I'm afraid not. You see, Hollywood beckons. I have just been offered a starring role in a major film. I have even had to quit Fright Night. And so you see... - I'll give you money. - How much? I have a $500 savings bond. I'll take it. Now, how are we going to cure your little friend of his delusion? I got it all figured out. We all go next door to the neighbor, and you perform some kind of vampire test on him to pronounce him human. You know, like in Orgy of the Damned, where you looked in the mirror, the guy didn't have a reflection, and then you knew he was a vampire. Yes. That was one of my favorite roles. Do you know... I still have the prop. Yes. It's for you. Yes? Yes, this is Jerry Dandrige. I see. Well, yes. Yes, of course. I'm always willing to help young people, but I'm afraid that crosses are out of the question. You see, I've been reborn recently. He's a reborn Christian. He thinks crosses would be sacrilegious. Ask him how he feels about holy water? How about holy water? No. Tell him it's just ordinary tap water. All he has to do is sip it. Yes. Well, yes. Yes, okay. That sounds fine, but don't bring him over until 6:00 tomorrow. I'll be out until then. Well, it seems we don't have to go out tonight after all. His friends are bringing him over tomorrow night to prove to him that I'm not a vampire. It's 6:10. He said he would be here at 6:00, right? Relax, he said he'd be here. He'll be here. Here he comes! Oh, thank you. Charley Brewster, I presume. Peter Vincent, vampire killer. Mr. Vincent, I cannot tell you how much I appreciate this. Good evening. Good evening. Now, down to business. Where is the lair of this suspected creature of the night? There. Oh, yes, I see what you mean. There is a distinct possibility. Shall we go? Hey, wait, wait a minute, wait a minute, where's your stakes and hammers? Oh, I left that in my bag. You're not going in there without them! But, I have to prove that he's a vampire before I kill him, Charley. Look, I know he's a vampire! I am the one who has to know, Charley. How're you gonna do that? This is holy water. If a drop touches him, he will blister. In this case, I've asked him to drink it while we all watch. He readily agreed. Yeah, but, Mr. Vincent, if I am right and you prove he is a vampire, he's gonna kill us all right then and there. No, he won't, Charley, after all I am here to protect you. I am Peter Vincent... I know, Mr. Vincent, but... Hey, Peter Vincent. Billy Cole. This is a pleasure. Won't you all come in? Hello. Hello. And Charley. Hey, Jer! They're here. Perhaps, he didn't hear you. Oh, he heard me, all right. Mr. Vincent, I've seen all of your films, and I've found them very amusing. Oh, thank you. And, uh, who are these two... Attractive young people? Ed Thompson. Ed. Amy Peterson. Charmed. Isn't that what vampires are supposed to do, Charley? That's some vampire, Brewster. Oh, God! He's neat. Please excuse the mess. I haven't finished unpacking. Where do you keep your coffin? Or do you have more than one? Charley! It's all right, Mr. Vincent. I'm used to it by now. As you may or may not know, Charley even brought the police over a few days ago. Charley, you didn't. Damn right I did. Only, they didn't believe me any more than any of you, but you'll believe me in a second. Mr. Vincent, give him the holy water. Charley, there's no reason to be rude about this. It's perfectly all right, Mr. Vincent. Where is it? And are you sure that this is, uh, holy water? Positive. I saw Father Scanlon bless it down at St. Mary's myself. Get ready to run. I'll protect you with this. Well... Bottoms up. There. Satisfied? Totally. Well, now, Charley, you saw that. Are you convinced now that Mr. Dandrige is not a vampire? It can't be. But, Charley, you saw it. You know, as well as I do that no vampire can drink blessed water. Then it wasn't blessed. Are you calling me a liar, young man? If he's not a vampire, have him touch this. Oh, Charley! You've made a fool of yourself once. There's no reason to compound the error. Yes, Charley. You've already caused your friends quite enough pain. You wouldn't want to cause them any more, would you? No. No, of course not. And you're finally convinced I'm not a vampire, either. Right? Yes. Well, I'm glad that's settled. I can't tell you how much I appreciate this, Mr. Vincent. You've been a great help. - Not at all. - Glad to be of service. It was nice meeting both of you. Please feel free to drop by anytime. You'll always be welcome. I'd like that, Mr. Dandrige. Please call me Jerry. Come on, let's get out of here. - Just a minute. - That goes for you too, Ed. I expect we have a lot of the same interests, you know, in horror movies and the occult. Something wrong, Mr. Vincent? No... I... I felt a little... Oh, it, it... It's just my clumsiness. Are you sure? Oh, yeah, I'm positive. We've been taking up too much of your time. Thank you so much. Come along now, everybody. Thank you. Bye-bye. What's wrong with you? Nothing. Then why are you shaking? I'm not shaking. You saw something in there, didn't you? You saw something that convinced you he was a vampire. Of course not. Please, Mr. Vincent, you have to tell me. Our lives depend on it. All right! He didn't cast a reflection in my mirror. Satisfied now? Mr. Vincent, you have to call the police! Mr. Vincent! Shit! Where you going, pencil dick? Home! No way! We walk Amy home first. Looks just like her, doesn't she? One good thing. They'll never believe him now. No? Let's cut through here. No way! Come on, we want people and lights. The more, the better. Ah, listen, Brewster, vampires don't exist. Haven't you gotten that through your thick head, yet? What if you're wrong, Evil? What if Dandrige is a vampire and he thinks you know it? Would you walk down that alley then? Oh, fuck you, Brewster. All right, come on, please just stick with us, all right? Forget it! You may be chicken shit, but I'm not. What do we do? Let him go. No vampire's gonna want him anyway. Probably give him blood poisoning. Are you all right? Jesus, I warned him! He got me, Charley! He bit me! You know what you're gonna have to do now, don't you? Kill me. Kill me, Charley. Before I turn into a vampire and give you a hickey! You asshole! You really believed me, you poor dope! You'll get yours someday. Oh, yeah, when? When I'm bit by a vampire? There are no such things as vampires, fruitcake! Jeez! Charley, Amy, is that you? If that's you, it's not working. I'm not scared. Shit! Hello, Edward. You don't have to be afraid of me. I know what it's like being different. They won't pick on you any more or beat you up. I'll see to that. All you have to do is take my hand. Here, Edward, take my hand. What was that? It was just Evil messing around again. Cut it out, Evil! It's not funny! Amy, what if Evil was really in trouble? Charley, you're not going to let him sucker you in again, are you? Tell me this is a power outage. Well, what else would it be? Hey! Hey, you can't come in here! Who're you calling? The police. Who is it? EDI It's me, Evil Ed. What do you want? Hurry, there's a vampire out here. Let me in! What're we gonna do? What're you gonna do? Not me! Now, I used to admire you, you know that? Of course, that was before I found out what a fake you were. Peter Vincent! The great vampire killer! What have you done to me? Back! The Master will kill you for this, but not fast! Slowly! Oh, so slowly! Back! I say back! He doesn't believe me! I'm scared, Charley. I'm really scared. I am not going to let him get you, Amy. I promise. You got Peter Vincent's number? He doesn't care about us! I paid him to be there today. It doesn't matter, Amy. We don't have any choice. Give me his number. Look, you've got to help us. Dandrige has me and Amy trapped in this club. No, Charley, I'm sorry. I just can't do that. Mr. Vincent, you've got to come. Come on, you're the only one who knows what's going on! Let her go. Filthy son of a bitch! You shouldn't lose your temper, Charley. It isn't polite. You can't kill me here. I don't want to kill you, Charley. I want you to bring Peter Vincent to my house, just the two of you. That is, if you ever want to see Amy again. Let her go! I got him. She's mine. Man, you go some place else. Out of my way. Move it. Leon! Amy! Charley! Amy! Amy! Amy! Amy! Amy! Peter! Peter, open the door! Who is it? It's me, Charley Brewster. Let me in. Are you one of them? What're you talking about? Here. Grab this. Come on! Peter, we don't have much time. Dandrige chased me and Amy all over town. He trapped us in this place called The Club... What're you doing? I'm leaving. You can't! Just watch me. But Dandrige has Amy! He says he's gonna kill her unless we come to his house. Oh, my God! The police! I'll call the police. They won't believe you. I've tried. Peter, it's just us. We're going to have to save Amy. I can't. I... was paid... to be there today. I know. You still want my help? Yes. You're Peter Vincent. The great vampire killer. That is a character in a movie. That isn't even my real name. I'm terrified. I'm sorry, Charley, but I am. I can't do it alone, Peter. If you don't help, Amy is going to die. Me, too, probably. Please, Peter. I'm sorry, Charley. She's someone I knew a long time ago. Where am I? Where's Charley? Where? I... Peter Vincent, ready to battle the undead. Peter, this is serious. I am serious. Hold this. Clamp. There. Let's see, now. Flashlight, stakes, hammer. Ah, yes, a cross. How are you going to stop Billy Cole? With this. It's from Orgy Of the Damned. Bullets won't stop him if he's not human. Doesn't he walk in daylight? Yeah. Then he is human. Come on. Peter, I want to thank you. Not now. What's wrong? Nothing. Nothing at all. Are you crazy? Not the front door. Let's go around back. Sneak in. Too late. I am Peter Vincent, the great vampire killer. I am Peter Vincent, the great vampire killer. I am Peter Vincent, the great vampire killer. This way. Did you hear something? No. Let's come back at dawn. He'll be asleep then. We'll have a better chance of getting Amy. Amy will be dead by then. Come on. Welcome to Fright Night. For real. Where's Amy? Up here. All you have to do is get by me. Back, spawn of Satan. Oh, really? You have to have faith for this to work on me, Mr. Vincent. Stop. Back. We're gonna make it. Mrs. Brewster. Mrs. Brewster. Operator, get me the... Mrs. Brewster. Mrs. Brewster. Thank God. The phone wires have been cut. I know. I did it. Where is Charley's mother? Oh. Well, apparently she's working nights. But she left a note. His dinner's in the oven. I... You wanted her, there she is. Here. You're going to need it just before dawn. What have you done to her? Amy? No! Charley. Charley. Peter? Charley, I'm going to break the door down. Make as much noise as you can. Help. Help. Let me out. Help. Open the door! I think she just opened her eyes. Help. Help, somebody. Grab her. Let's get out of here. We can't. Look. Oh, my God. Something wrong? Yes. We have a visitor. Is it too late to save her? No. Not if we kill Dandrige before dawn. Are you sure? Everything has been like it was in movies. We just have to keep hoping. Let's go. Well. What do we have here? Vampire killers? Stop, or I'll shoot. I mean it. Don't make me shoot. Stop. We have him. Do you? What did he mean by that? Nothing. He was just bluffing. Amy. Amy? Peter. She's worse. We're running out of time. Amy awake. I command you to... awake. Show me how much you love me, Amy. Kill them. Both. He's on the roof. I'm going up there. - Charley. - He's not up here. Look out. He's going downstairs. Charley. Charley. So. Stay back. Back. You have to have faith for that to work, Mr. Vincent. Remember? You're out of time, Mr. Dandrige. Look over your shoulder. No! Charley. Back. Are you all right? Yeah. He's in the basement. His coffin. It's got to be down here somewhere. What was that? You keep searching. I'll check it out. Amy? It's me. I know. Charley. I found it. Don't be frightened, Charley. Hurry, Peter. Get it open. He's locked it from the inside. What's wrong? Don't you want me any more? It's not my fault, Charley. You promised you wouldn't let him get me. You promised. Amy. Peter. Charley, watch out. Amy! Look, we've been going in a circle. We're back where we started. Ladies and gentlemen, Fright Night theater. This is Peter Vincent. Back once more as host of Fright Night. I thought I'd let the vampires rest for a little while. Right, Charley? Tonight, the threat comes not from beyond the grave, but from beyond the stars as alien beings stalk an unwary summer camp in Mars Wants Flesh. I do not star in it. Charley? Is something wrong? No. Oh, you're so cool, Brewster. Fright night. Fright night
