TO THE MEMORY OF LAURENT PERRIN APRES MAI. Something in the air. 1971, not far from Paris Together, we'll read this excerpt from Blaise Pascal's "Pens?es". Don't balk at the phrasing. It's from another era. Then you'll tell me what it reminds you of in today's terms. "It requires no great superiority of mind to understand that nothing produces true and solid satisfaction, that all our pleasures are mere vanity. " "our troubles innumerable. "and finallly that death "threatens us at every moment, "and will put us, in several years or maybe several hours, "in a state of eternal happiness "or unhappiness "or annihilation. Between us and the sky hell or nothingness, there is but life, the most fragile thing in the world". We Watch the Police! "All!" "We Want It All. " Demonstration, Place de Clichy. Geismar stopped his hunger strike. Cops want to ban it. We have to go. Fight's still on. CRS = SS Beat it! Combat, Parapluie, Actuel, and J'accuse, please. 8.50 They Tried to Kill Richard Deshayes "Apolitical student Gilles Guiot, arrested by cops who claim he'd attacked them. "was sentenced to six months prison. "Support groups met yesterday at Lyc?e Chaptal... " Who cares about Guion? - Shut up, Alain! - Fuck you! - You like repression? - When it targets apolitical students. "They call for a demonstration demanding his release. " - Who agrees? - That's not enough. He's innocent! Everyone's aware of his case. We can mobilize them. Increase our numbers. Guiot isn't the problem. It's the conditions of prisoners. Since CAL wasbanned, we're isolated. We need a unified high-school movement! So Trotskyites take over? Who are you for? For a responsible political line! Deshayes, Youth Liberation Front! He lost an eye. 15 wounded! Read the press! Cops shot rioters with tear-gas grenades. We saw. They're out for revenge. Call for the dissolution of their Special Brigades! Dissolution! - Graffiti tomorrow? - I'm in. We need posters from Paris. I'll get them. Is it defamation to call attention to a simple fact? "Paris has recently become the capital of police. "Policemen swarm about on foot, in motorcycles, vans "and those ominous buses stationed at intersections. "Our city's face is disfigured, not only for Parisians but for foreign visitors as well". Here's the material. Take what you need. If you come back later, the new tract will be ready. "?Is it defamation to condemn what is obvious: "the increasingly systematic intrusion "of the police in everyday life?" Chairman Mao's New Clothes In the West, some analysts latch onto the official label. Their essays take for granted the concept of a cultural revolution or even a civilizational one. The scores of corpses washing up on Hong Kong's shores ilustrate, on a tiny scale a grisly drama the entire country is undergoing. Idiots cannot but produce idiocies as apple trees, apples. Having seen these corpses float down the Yellow River, I refuse this idyllic image of the Cultural Revolution. I thought you'd be at the station. I took an earlier train. It was was nice out. I started to walk. The Free Press. That's nice. The ones you mentioned? Yeah, but I can do better. That one's so-so. This one too. This one is too busy. I prefer this one. Take it, it's yours. I came because I have something important to say. I'm going away. Where? London, in two days. My step-dad's doing the light-show for Soft Machine. They're already rehearsing. Will you be gone long? I don't know till when. Mom's leaving Paris to live with him in Notting Hill. I'll be at the Lyc?e Fran?ais. Will you be back this summer? We're going to Ibiza. I'll come to London. I bookmarked the ones I like most. There's no more gas. I'm sorry. I'll go on my own. I'll come along. I'm sorry. It's hard to say it, but don't come visit. I'll write you. It will be easier. Seems clear enough. You're wrong. It's complicated. I still love you. Someone else? Maybe. I don't know. I'm not sure. I need time to think. I don't want to lose you. Me neither. Can I walk you to the station? A platform is too depressing. Don't watch me leave. They'll think twice before tearing off our posters. How are the revolutionaries doing? I told you not to use our mimeograph to print your filth. We can't condemn the moral order? And sexual repression? We're working on that issue. You discredit our struggle. Finish up and get lost. Youth too worried about the future What the fuck is going on? Beat it, pricks! Got you! Let go of him, assholes! They're throwing rocks! Back off! Jean-Pierre! This way! It's all over. On every building. Dissolution... Special Brigades... What Special Brigades? In this early work, "The German Ideology" - years before "The Communist Manifesto" their criticism of Max Stirner, who called communism "utopian" helped Marx and Engels define historical materialism and make a permanent break with Feuerbach's idealism. So who exactly is Max Stirner? He wrote... Come in. Sorry to interrupt. Jean-Pierre Moulinet, principal's office. Take your belongings. Security guards across the street gave a bag to the police in wich they found your school ID. This ties you in with the vandalism that occurred last night on school premises For insurance reasons, I must file a complaint. Punishment will be up to the Disciplinary Committee. Any questions? You weren't alone. I won't encourage you to tell on others. I leave you with your conscience and convictions. But I regret having to waste my budget to pay for your stupidity. - See Jean-Pierre? - He's going before Disciplinary. - Did he give names? - Not a word. His parents won't let him take the fall. I know them. They'd never do that. The guards turned him in. They're SAC fascists. They'll pay for it. Fuck, it's them! - Same scum! - Over there! You won't get away with this! We saw you. Fuck! Laurent! Youth Liberation Front manifesto. Saturday 3 pm, Jussieu. "All!" New issue! "Special Brigades Against a New World!" Rackham the Red, 5 pm, the St. James. The news isn't good. My contacts say the guard's out of his coma. But he can't talk. There's no prognostic. They're waiting. They know it's us? They saw nothing. Shadows in the dark. Still... they're definitely onto you. - They'll question Jean-Pierre. - I was home with my parents. Ideally... use summer vacation to lie low. We have hide-outs. It's fine. We discussed it. We'll go to Italy. It was planned. Contact our comrades at Fiat in Torino. We're not going there. And you? My dad has me working at his garage in Toulouse. I'll stay with him. My mom has a studio in Paris. AJS asked me to join them full-time. Did you accept? I'm ready to commit. If I can really help. - May I? - Help yourself. Where's the restroom? Is the camera yours? All the equipment is. If I have a project, can I borrow it? What kind of project? I don't know. If I want to make a short, for example. You'll tell the collective. We do agit-prop. Usually we don't lend for fiction. Reading "Chairman Mao's New Clothes"? It's propaganda and the author is a CIA agent. It's an alias. There's no Simon Leys. He's a Belgian sinologist named Pierre Ryckmans. He's very well-documented. He's honest about the massacres in China. Cultural Revolution scares American and Soviet imperialists. That's why they slander it. You're young, but watch what you read. I came with G?rard. He and his brother started the movement. We want the same pay they get in Bezons. At our parent company. They get 20% more for the same work. We just get empty promises. So we're forming our own union. With other militants we helped them organized. At Turbinax, union leaders and foreman are in cahoots. They wheel and deal. Workers get jackshit. The workforce has been grumbling for a while. It started in the workshop. Worker's rep pissed me off. Everyone agreed. We voted for a wildcat. To occupy the premises. Old union guys opposed. The majority shut them up. Think we can film the comrades on strike? I can manage that. I'll get your equipment in. And you can get in by the canal. If you're not scare of water. An amazing opportunity for the area. Other factories will follow suit. It scares the communists. They fear worker autonomy. And the revolutionary ideas it inspires. You walk two miles to the village. I'll show you. There's a shortcut by the coomb. Valence by bus, then a train to Italy. It's really easy. You know were to go? Not really. Florence, then we'll see. Our comrades are there. They're showing our films to Tuscan workers. They'll meet militant filmmakers. Create an alternative network. Sorry but I can't tell if you love me. You can be honest. Do you love me? Yes. More than Laure? You don't know her. She lives the life you want to live. She's free, an artist. I'm nothing like that. It's over with Laure. - Jean-Pierre is being charged. - He wasn't there. Guards say he was. That's a disgusting lie. Cops questioned his parents. They're investigating. Bastards. Coordinated attacks by patriots led to a consolidated free zone which runs all the way from north to south, comprising two-thirds of Laos. In it, half the population, faced with a gigantic war of destruction, toil away for the National Democratic Revolution foreshadowing a Laos that is independent, democratic and prosperous. The 1500th American plane had just been shot down. It was a reason to rejoice. The people were also cheering on the terms for a 5-point political solution proposed by the Front to resolve the Laos problem according to the 1962 Geneva Accords and the situation on the ground. Our people have rallied around the Lao Patriotic Front presided by Prince Souphanouvong and will fight until the ultimate victory. Beautiful film, "Laos: Rescued Images", by Madeleine Riffaud the last in our comrade's selection from the French "Hedgehog" collective. Here they are to speak with you. I really appreciated the film, a tribute to the courage of Laotian combatants. Their struggle is overlooked by government media. These are the films the Italian people want to see on TV. In the future, it will be the case. I'm certain. This is what our struggle is about. To denounce the lies of capitalist media. To set up a model of free information. to serve the international revolution! Italian workers must know... Can you help me out? Italian workers must know... how the Laotian people... are defying imperialist forces. A question for our French comrades. Your films adopt a classical style, like that of the bourgeoisie. Shouldn't revolutionary cinema employ revolutionary syntax? Such a style would be a shock for the proletariat. Our role is to enlighten them. Could it be that the revolutionary syntax the comrade mentioned... is in truth the individualistic style of the petite bourgeoisie? Can you help me? I can't manage. Concerning the tract for the workers at "Nuovo Pignone"... They need to know it's too toned down. It's disappointing. I provided a document... I used to work in the industry. But you can't make entertainment in revolutionary times. Our actions must synch with our ideas. My dad works at a nuclear plant. He organized a workgroup on its dangers. They want their conclusions known. We have a project on work conditions there. I didn't get why revolutionary syntax is the style of the bourgeoisie. Let's make the struggles known. Forget style. Cinema is for a future agenda. So you accept the language of the enemy? We target the people, no esthetes. New ideas require a new language. Revolutionary workers speak that new language. We must record what they say. That's why we're going to Reggio Calabria. Rioters laid siege for 3 weeks. We want to hear the rebel workers. They stood up to the State. Their struggle can teach us. Jean-Ren? asked me to go to Reggio Calabria. To do what? Tons of things. The Italian comrades won't help them. You have to cme. I can't. I have my Beaux Arts entrance exam. Join us afterwards. Take you exam and come. You've make up your mind. Promise you'll come. I don't like them much. Boring films, primitive politics. They act on their convictions. Do you do any better? I'm meeting them at the square. Their contact in Reggio Calabria is French. I wrote down his number. Call to say when you're coming. I doubt they need me. Don't play dumb. I need you. Now's your chance to learn filmmaking. You'll do what you want, as usual. I spoke to Jean-Pierre. He won't rat on us. The Trotskyites are helping. They're behind him. Does he need us? They got him a good lawyer. They are suing for perjury. They say the others have no case. And the guard? I don't know. They tossed coins 3 times. Each time the book said to leave. I'm going along. - To Goa? - No, not Goa. It's too hot. Then it's monsoon season. Better to go to Nepal. It's higher up, cooler. Leslie knows a Buddhist dance school. Tibetan, if I got it right. What about going to Art Dec?? Leslie and I were really lucky to meet. We're in love. The rest can wait. It's intolerable that Brezhnev is welcomed in Paris by Pompidou. We have to denounce it. The Communist Party won't! Brezhnev is staying where the Queen of England stayed. Versailles. That's a good lead-in. Let's say no to this kind of communism. It's not what we want! Tell it to the workers. We don't do fluff here at "Rouge". The solutions come from below. We still have the power to denounce! Workers know it. Let's get their voces heard. I corrected my article like you said. So? You're right. It's better. I'll send it on. They should publish it. It's a responsible reading on the high-school movement. Your text shows what's really at stake. Try it bigger, please. The whole page. That's better. Keep working on this space here. Same problem as always. The shoulders are on the same plane. one lower than the other. It throws the rest off kilter. Gilles: London was conventional and boring this spring but summer in Ibiza was happier. We lived with an alcoholic musician. I helped Mom make jewelry. She sold it at the market. We did it okay. I have to tell you. I met someone. Jean-Serge. He's older than me. Cut off from his rich parents, he spends all he has on the counterculture. He produced experimental films, finances the Free Press. Do you know John Ashbery? Here's a poem of his... - I'm glad you came. - We never see you. I'm here all day. I'm saving up to move closer by. I didn't go back to Italy. Christine insisted but I had no reason to be there. On the way back they stopped in Auvergne. - They edited there. - And then? I have no idea. She stopped answering. See my article in "Rouge"? I don't read "Rouge". Not every week. I have it for you. High-School Militancy Adrift "Who are the anarchists playing?" - You mean me? - It's us. We were wrong? Politics is no game. We fight for the working class. The poor, disenfranchised, exploited by the system. We're in high-school. We can only fight for student rights. Can I be frank? You're outside the real struggle. You watch but you protect yourself. You're wrong. I have convictions. Painting. Revolution. You speak as an artist. Art is solitude. It's a choice. Not mine. - Your job's better? - For learning life, yes. Your father asked you to lunch. Meet him in his office? Okay. Done with 30-year-old women? Almost. 60-year-old men need to be reorganized next. I'm at my wit's end. I can't cope. "Splendors an Miseries of Courtesans" will honor the ORTF's policy of quality. We need ambitious projects... Their meeting is just about over. Or Ch?jov. You know "A Hounting Drama"? Good crime story, excellent female role. For next season. I had lunch with Laure's mother yesterday. She's worried about her. Any special reason? She's back and in a bad shape. Her mother dislikes her boyfriend. From a wealthy family. She thinks she does drugs. Know anything? She barged into her mother's place, jumpy and confused. May I? So I saw the doctor... Nothing bad, but it won't get better. Parkinson's leaves no room for surprise. I thought those Swiss drugs stabilized it. It never really stabilizes. You're just buying time. Anything special to tell me? With my fingers getting stiff, it's hard for me to write by hand. And no easier with a typewriter. I'll need your help. Like a secretary? You'll learn the trade. I told you I don't want to. You want to make films? Not like that. I didn't think you'd come. Come on... Too many people here. I was afraid to see you. That you'd be different. And you're different. Aren't you? No, not enough. I went to Italy. I came back. Life hasn't changed. I brought my new drawings. Your best work so far. You're very lucky. Why? You know what you'll be. A painter. You don't know? I live day by day. Anything can happen. I don't try to control it. It's you who's right. You live in the present. I'm afraid to miss out on everything. I lost you. I'm afraid to miss out on my youth. Don't envy me. This one's my favorite. What are you doing? It was for you. You saw it. No one else must. Come. Careful. Your mom says you do drugs. To who? To my dad, among others. What an idiot. It's not true? Of course not. I'm going to New York tomorrow for a while. There's lots going on there now. Jean-Serge is opening a gallery. Going to Paris? "At some point on every case "Chef Inspector Maigret needed to size things up. "After his favorite dish, pork and lentils, "he drank some brandy, then walked by the river. "The unfathomable comfort he experienced while digesting "would lead to the free association of his thoughts. " What is it, Gilles? Maigret always has to size things up. So? What's the problem? Because it's Simenon who gets so lost in his plot... he writes himself into a corner... He needs to size things up. He's a great writer. He knows what he's doing. He's a great writer, but... he wrote a Maigret a week in the 60s. Look how it's constructed. It's well-constructed! Listen to he dialogue. It's strained. Disdain for your work spells failure. I'm trying to help. I'm allowed an opinion. How can you belittle Simenon? What have you done? I don't disdain him. I see when he cheats. He cheats. But I do disdain TV. It's a tool to numb the masses. Big words you read in papers! First learn to write, then judge things as rashly as you want. His books are sloppy, like your scripts. - Not true! - The directors are hacks. You can't say that! Since his accident, Jean Richard can't say his lines. A zombie with a pipe! He's courageous. Recovering from a near-fatal accident. Spare me. Even Simenon says he's awful. If you think it's such torture, just give up. I'm right, you hypocrite! I'm not a hypocrite. And you're wrong! Who's he? A friend. Keep it up! Pass the ball faster! Go all out! Later, Laurent. Come on. Let's go talk. Thanks for seeing me. My mom told me to. What is it? Recognize me? They say my concentration will improve. It's better already. I gave up security. The city offered me this job. Pays less. Kids... I have tomorrow's schedule. Remember what we did today. Stay tight on defense, steal the ball, keep passing, fan out. At 15 feet, shoot. You know I wasn't at the accident. It was not accident. The assault, sorry. They were your friends. But you did see me? You know who was there. You know them. And you? You know? - So why blame me? - To get their names. I don't know them. The Trotskyistes are paying for your lawyer? That's right. I hear he's good. He does it out of conviction. Yes, he's very good. You have no case. My mom says so too. That we'll never win. That it's best to forget. You'll drop the charges? Get lost. I said get lost! Rooftop of a Kabul hotel. Belongs to an italian artist. He designs rugs there. You want a beer? Yeah, sure. That's his work. Contemporary designs, traditional woven. They're maps. Imagine them bigger... six feet high. He questions the status of the artist. He didn't draw the map. Politics took care of that. Same goes for flags. He doesn't even weave them. Still, he designs them. He's part of the process as geopolitics, seamtresses. No more, no less. So artists are vessels? He asked me to be his assistant. - Doing it? - I don't know. It's a tough decision. Afghanistan is far. Make it to Nepal? Kabul was the end of that trip. We had to get back. Why? Is it a secret? I brought my drawings... to the editors of "Parapluie. " They have a band called "Fille Qui Mousse". They want collages for their light show. Waste of time. Isn't there better to do? Like what? Like your paintings. You're starting out, like me. You have progress to make. I don't have much time. I prefer to draw. You're wrong. I preferred your paintings. Will you show them to me? I'd rather not. They're not me anymore. I couldn't say why. Here it is. The guard dropped charges. I forgot about him. Good for Jean-Pierre. For you too, right? Stay as long as you want. Leslie's friends are away till June. They teach at Brown. Can you shut off the engine? They're filming. What movie? I heard it's Maigret. Is Jean Richard here? Make sure there's hot tea in Jean's trailer tomorrow. Don't worry. He said you forgot. Graciously, but he said it. Don't worry. Here's the transparency. This is nice. Okay, we keep it. And "No More Brain", third. With slogans like this... Victory for the people's struggle! You could have waited. I couldn't. I had to be here for the end of the show. Our comrades think the theater owner is cheating them. So you count the spectaros? To catch him. Coffee. Same here. And two glasses of water. It's our first commercial release, so we're suspicious. I saw the film. And? Nothing. Comrades risked their lives to film it and smuggle it out. So people know how desperate the situation is. It's exceptional. I didn't say I don't agree. I totally do. You live with Jean-Ren?? A house in Kremlin-Bic?tre. With members of the collective. The film you made in Italy... Is it finished? We're still debating. Comrades find it politically questionable. It's tense but fascinating. I'm learning a lot. We have an office. I answer the phone, tend to the prints. It keeps me busy. I want to go to college but I missed registration. I may go to London. To be a gofer on a film. It may not work out. What film? Nothing like yours. Go on. Science fiction. With prehistoric animals. And Nazis... I think. Still drawing? Sure. I was published in "Parapluie". I saw. Like it? A lot. You know I like what you do. They cropped it an added yellow print. It doesn't matter. It's good. I have to go. It's late. Kremlin-Bic?tre is far. "Whenever painters try to cast off representation, they do so destroying painting and their survival as painters". Any good? It's amazing. Do you agree? To some extent. We follow our own path. But it costs you sometimes a lot. You can't know. I understand. I think I do. I saw Christine. And? She didn't go her own way. She wants a relationship. Hence the older man. You want a relationship? I'm upset with myself. I live in my fantasies. When reality knocks, I don't open. He tell you? Briefly. No need for more. It would be dangerous. For you and us. I thought it over. You're partially right. Militancy is getting us nowhere. Bourgeoise elections even less. It's a trap. It's time for action. No revolution ever avoided it. French resistance took up arms. We extol their heroism. We're the new resistance. Don't Maoists say that? Maybe they're right. So we're breaking with the Trotskyites. Where do you position yourself? Why talk anarchy if you don't act on it? It's easy. The car comes. The comrades change vehicles. Set theirs on fire in the woods. He'll take you back by motorcycle. - If it's worth it. - It's not our call. We chose the underground, and its rules. First one: no questions. And if it backfires... what do I risk? Don't ask what you risk... but if you'll be true to yourself. The prints of "Weekend in Sochaux" are booked all summer. It's possible in September. For unions, it's free of charge. Fine. I'll send you the form. For us the problem was how to incorporate their demans into a larger revolutionary context. We were stuck. So we gave the camera to the workers. What they shot was pretty surprising. Stronger that what we did. Their perspective is truer. They go straight to the heart of the problem. I think we've gathered enough material. They want to edit it themselves. I'm not at all sure about this. They need a minimum of technical skills. We have to help. Monique can go do the technical stuff. Great. That settles it. I went shopping. Tonight I work at the restaurant. With the lesbians? Not lesbians. Feminists. Did you pick up the print? The phone was ringing all day. But I need it for tomorrow. So get it yourself. I didn't mean that. I'll care of it tomorrow. Christine! Anything I should know? You come and go... We cross paths. I have a lot of work. I have work too. We managed before. There's nothing. If you want to talk... I'm looking for Gilles. Alain! Gilles went to London. Andrew knows Leslie's parents. This is his place. He's back for the trimester. It wasn't planned. His kids are coming. I'm leaving tomorrow. When did Gilles leave? Last week. I wrote him. I know. I don't have his address. I'll forward the letter once I do. - A number? - We can't call him. He calls. You left Jean-Ren?? You can spend the night. No thanks. I'd rather not. Got a place to sleep? I'll manage. Don't worry about me. What about you, Alain? Leslie's in New York. I won't go. It's not for me. I'm not ready. Later, maybe. For now it's painting. I still have a lot to learn. It means going back to Kabul. I know it'll be tough. The Situationist International arrived at a point in History as the thought of a world collapsing. It is now occurring before our eyes. The new era is deeply revolutionary. and it knows it. In all of society, no one can or will continue as before. We will not submit to what is going on. The demand of life has become a revolutionary program.
