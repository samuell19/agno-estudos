Alice! Alice! Alice. Oh, God, there you are. Are you all right? Huh? What happened? Jakey Snyder came a calling, on account of that debt he says you owe him for the rustling job in Colorado last spring. I don’t owe him a goddamn dime. Well, it don’t matter, because he says he’s going to burn down this house with us in it. Our boy stopped him, and he went and said he’d wrangle the money and get it to Jakey tomorrow. I tried to stop him, Mike, But you know, our boy is getting to the age where he thinks he can handle things by himself. Yeah, and he’s stubborn, too, just like you. Where’d you say he was going? The bank in Sweetwater. Oh... I’ll handle that. I’ll take care of this. If that little prick comes back here, you know how to use it. Lock the doors. You bring our boy back safe. I will. Madame, you got my word. Put that goddamn thing away. What are you doing, Robert? Jakey Snyder said he’s going to kill us if we don’t settler your debt. Jakey Snyder’s full of shit, and you know that. We got no other choice, Mike. I did not ask you to do this. The fact that you drag your little friend in there -into our business? -Yeah. I can take care of Jakey Snyder, believe me. If you’d done any kind of preparation or homework on this goddamn thing, you would understand that that bank has been robbed seven times in the last six months. They brought Pinkertons in. They brought railroad detectives in. Every other man on the street is some kind of lawman waiting for one thing: for someone to cross the line. -I don’t really care. -Oh, really? This isn’t cattle rustling. This isn’t grifting. This isn’t all that petty little bullshit. You rob a bank and you’re done. Your picture is going to be on every goddamn poster from here to Fort Worth. -I don’t... -Hear me. Lost time is never found again. Get your hands off me, old man. Oh, sure, go ahead and kill yourself. You’re making a mistake. You’re gonna regret it. -All right, nobody move! -Jesus Christ. Chaz. You wait till they come out. Hurry up, you’ve got 30 seconds. No, please! Mister, get out of my way. Otherwise, I’m going to assume you’re a member of this gang and treat you as such. No, please. One of those kids in there is my son. Give me a chance to just talk to him. Do you understand? Please. Everybody deserves a second chance, for Christ’s sake, Not him. [women screaming] Detective Schumacher, move up! [groans] Throw your guns out and come out with your hands up. And I promise you, your punishment will be just and appropriate. If you go against me, it will be a death sentence for the both of you. Run! Dolly! I dropped Dolly! [grunts] Son, you’re all alone now. The law’s all around you. [gunfire] Jolena! [woman screams] Oh, God no! My baby! You want to end up like your friend or that old man who got in my way bleeding out in the street? Or that little girl who got caught in the crossfire? Please, no! Let’s make this easy! [panting] [gunshot] [gunfire] [groans] [grunts] Who was that with you? No one. Name. Butch. Last name. Cassidy. Good afternoon. I understand you have a safe aboard this train. Yeah. We do. It’s in the mail car. [chuckles] Ha! That was one hell of a rehearsal. -What do you think, Butch? -Good. Except that last part where you ran up like an idiot and said my name, Bob. Yeah, yeah. Sorry about that. Questions? Everybody knows their job? You bet, Butch. Good. You do have a conductor uniform, don’t you? Of course I do. All right. Last thing we do before we ride out is Isom goes and cuts the telegraph wires at the ticket office. Ben, Laura, this being your first job with us, on account of being down a man with Will Carver still locked up, we’re only here for the loot. Not to kill nobody. You’re only going to use your guns if the plan goes to hell. But no shooting. -Understood? -Got it, Butch. Understood. Half for today and half for tomorrow. Thank you, Butch. See y’all tomorrow at the Northern Pacific Rail. Didn’t he say the Southern Pacific rail the other day? Yeah, yeah, he did say that. He’s your boy, Elzy. I mean Northern, Southern, I don’t think it matters too much as long as train comes in 9:00 A.M., right? As long as he’s on it. I mean, he wants the second half of his money. He don’t want to be looking over his shoulder the rest of his life. There won’t be much life left if he doesn’t show up. We better get out of here. Got a big day ahead of us tomorrow. [neighs] All right, boy. We’re going. Train’s early. Gonna have to catch up to it. Let’s get it. Hyah! [train whistle blows] [train whistle blows] Let me help you with that, Ma’am. You sure it’s wise to team up with these kids? They’re a bit soft for my taste. Uh-huh. Butch Cassidy. Breaking all them young hearts. Butch Cassidy is a good scout when it comes to robbing banks and trains. Always has a solid plan, always gets the loot. Nothing ever goes wrong. There’s nothing to worry about. I’m reckon that’s all true. I just don’t see why he’s so against killing someone. To each his own, Ben. As long as Butch can hold his own. If it comes to a gunfight. That’s my girl. You two knock it off. -[train whistle blows] -All aboard! Wait, wait, who the hell is that with Bob? Hold on now. Hold on. Elzy? Let’s just give it a minute. I mean, maybe this guy’s shift’s ending and then Bob’s coming in. He would have said something if that was the case. Just give it a minute, okay? Sheriff! Butch Cassidy and the Wild Bunch is robbing the Union Flyer. We got this. Come on! Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Union Flyer’s 9:00 A.M. departure for Durango. Please have your tickets prepared for boarding. The Union Flyer? It’s not even the same train, Butch. What are we gonna do? I’m calling it. What’s that mean? We ain’t robbin’ the train now? Hell, no. I saw we do this kid. I need that money. All these trains come from Dubois got a company safe on them. They’re all headed west on that rail expansion. And there will be something on board. And we take whatever they got. Yeah. Follow me. Damn it, Curry. Last call aboard 9:00 a.m. Union Flyer. Thanks, sir. Greeting. Tickets, folks. Don’t do anything dumb, Mr. Conductor. We do as planned. Butch, you sure we should be doing this? We don’t know nothing about this train. Isom, I’m need you to calm down and focus. What we doing, Elzy? We’re going. And who might you be, sir? Name’s Edward. My friends call me Eddie. Well, Eddie, wait here a moment with my friends won’t ya? -Don’t do nothing stupid. -Yeah. You, too. Good morning, everyone. Now, I’m not looking to hurt you, and I’m not after your possessions. Just need a little bit of time and then you’re back on your way to Durango, is it? It’s a nice town. Y’all look like a smart bunch, so don’t nobody go trying to be a hero. Your lives ain’t worth it. Schofield? That’s a nice gun, old timer. Sit tight now. I got a dilemma I was hoping you could help me out with. Which one of these coaches has a safe on it, Eddie? Oh, they don’t tell us that. [gun clicks] It’s just a few cars back. Kindly take us there, won’t you? Yeah. Knew that seed spitting sack of shit Bob Meeks couldn’t be trusted. Working this shift all da, Eddie? -What? -You heard me. Just you supposed to be the only one working here today? I don’t understand what you’re saying, son, but yeah, I’m working all day if that’s what you’re asking. You’re going to help us out today, huh, Eddie? Yeah. This is the car with the safe in it. Ain’t going to be no surprises on there. No guards? No, No, uh-uh, just the safe in there, I promise. Unlock that door and slide it open for us, won’t you? Yeah. Climb up in there and open the safe for us, will you, Eddie? I can’t. No, I can’t. I promise. Wells Fargo, they don’t give us the key no more. Liar. What he’s saying is true. Throw some gunpowder in that keyhole. -We’ll blast it open. -Sure thing. Hey, boss, that door is real thick. I’m going to have to use all the gunpowder. We’re already here. We ain’t walking away from this one. How big a blast are we talking? I mean... it ain’t gonna go beyond the car. Make sure. There’s kids and parents on the train. I want nobody getting hurt. You got it. Ha! You’re Butch Cassidy. Yeah. You all the wild bunch, ain’t ya? Of course, I should have figured that one out. See, Butch Cassidy don’t kill nobody. There’s always a first. Ain’t nobody getting killed. He knows who we are. And you won’t say nothing will ya, Eddie? No, I ain’t going to say nothing. Hey, you know, it was them Daltons. Dalton gang done did it. Yep. I’m ready to blow this thing, boss. All right, let’s clear the door. Where do you think you’re going? -Nowhere. Nowhere. -Get over there. All right. [explosion] It’s the Wild Bunch. We’re being robbed. Woo-hoo! Get. [cheering] Look at all that money! You wanted to walk a couple minutes ago. -I’m glad we didn’t. -What’d y’all find? Oh, it’s a good thing we didn’t walk on this one. Plenty of money for everyone, baby. Pretty good take, boys. Let’s get it packed up, let’s get it out of here. [gunshot] What the hell did you do? He made a run for it. You couldn’t have ran after him? I warned him the first time. I told you there was to be no killing. Get that loot packed up and let’s go. [laughs] They shot Eddie. [laughing] Oh, yeah, baby! [laughing] All right, let’s split up. Curry, Ben, Laura, you had east. We’ll ride west. Meet up at the Hole in the Wall tonight. I’ve had enough of this. I’m going to send a wire to Charles Siringo at the Pinkertons. [telegraph clicking] Chaz, bring that to me. What is it, Charlie? Butch Cassidy. And his Wild Bunch. They’ve robbed a train. And killed a man. Want me to hold off on the McCarty’s, help ya? No, I’ll handle this. What’s wrong, Butch? Need to make sure no one is following us. Looks like we’re clear. Sheriff! Sheriff, you just missed him. They killed Eddie. Aw, shit. Which way did they go, Bart? Kid Curry headed east with two of them and Butch and the other two, they gone west. Nobody seems to be able to stop the Wild Bunch. We’ll handle it. You think Elzy’s going to be all right riding off on his own? Yeah, he’ll be all right. He had to lead them off trail, make sure they don’t tail us. We should’ve never join up with Curry and them other two. They’re crazy. Killing that old man wasn’t right. No, no, it wasn’t. Ain’t nothing we can do about it now. I’ll tell you what we can do. We never work with them again. Yeah, when Will Carver gets out of prison, we can think about it. For now, we got to work with the folks we got. Otherwise, there ain’t no sense in calling us the Wild Bunch. Well, here they come. Got to get going here. -Come on, get ’em! -[gunshots] Gunshots! Hey, hey! Where are you going? Someone’s shooting at us! Come on, Sheriff. Pick up that gun. Pick it up. Shame. [gunshot] [harmonica playing] Shouldn’t they have made it by now? Maybe they camped out. Maybe they got caught. Doubtful. Or maybe they ain’t coming. Why wouldn’t they show up? Because they got a bigger share of the loot than we did. No, that ain’t Curry’s style. He’s violent, but always keeps his word. He’ll show. Yeah. Bob ain’t show. Let it go, Isom. Come on, fellas. What’s with the faces? I’m not too hungry right now, Maude. You don’t know what you missing, Butch. Ah, just take it. Maybe you’ll be hungry in a bit. Would you look at that? Sitting around a campfire, singing songs. You save some food for us, Maude? Yeah, I got some leftovers, Kid. What about Bob? He didn’t show. Something must have happened. -Anyone follow you? -No. -You? -No. Better wipe that look off your face, Butch. You killed someone at one of my jobs today. I told all y’all there was to be no killing. If you hadn’t trusted Elzy to bring on that bum Bob Meeks, nobody would have died. I’m sorry, Butch. I don’t know what happened, but I trust Bob. He’s a straight shooter. As the leader of this gang, I should have checked Bob out personally. Especially after you and Laura saw him confuse the name of the rail. If there’s anyone to blame, it’s me. It’s my fault that he died today. I’m glad we agree on something. So we going to split this money up or what? All right, then. Isom. [laughing] -Yeah! -Woo! [cheering] What’ll you buy me? Ooh, whatever you want, baby. I’m gonna spend a whole summer drowning in women and tequila! ♪ I’ve been traveling ♪ ♪ All night long ♪ I’ve been traveling ♪ ♪ Singing my song What you going to do with your share of the loot, Butch? Retire? You know ain’t nobody live long enough to retire from this, Isom. Still ain’t answering my question. Remember Mike and Alice Cassidy? Yeah, of course I do. Them the folks that adopted you. Well, you know, Mike has since passed on. Thinking about buying me a small ranch near their property outside of Dubois. I help Alice out a little on account of she’s all alone now. That’s... That’s might kind of you, Butch. What you going to do on a ranch? Someone got killed today, Isom. I don’t want no more of what happened today on my conscience. I mean, it was bound to happen sooner or later. Just come with the job. Feeling guilty for that conductor ain’t going to bring him back. So now that you got your share of the money, it don’t matter that Eddie was killed today? I didn’t mean it like that, Butch. I’m sorry that we killed him. I’m talking about you, anyways. This ranch of yours. Being a rancher. Chicken, cattle, you know, cows, all that. That’s really what you want? I want to be like Mike Cassidy. Wake up, do the same thing every day. Chores, tend to the animals. Have real work to do. Growing up with him, I liked that things had to get done. Work had to get done every day. Every day, I had responsibilities. Don’t sound too bad, really. Owning you’re own land. My daddy and his daddy, they spent their whole lives on the plantation. I was lucky, I guess. I got emancipated. Hell, I might buy a ranch right next to you. Gonna have to do a couple more jobs first. Remember those numbers. I got a safe at the Dubois Bank. It’s the combination to it. You’re welcome to what’s in there. That’s much appreciated, Butch, but I don’t want no handouts. That’s... That’s your money. If you’re serious about buying some property, consider it a loan. Get out now and pay me back when you can. I don’t know if I’m ready for something like that yet. Suit yourself. Money’s there if you change your mind. Go ahead and hold onto that for me, won’t you, Elzy? Where you going? Go check out some property. - Y’all gonna be here, right? - Hell yeah, we’ll be here. We ain’t going nowhere. We drank too much last night. Yeah, we did, babe. What are your plans? Ride out to Robber’s Roost, maybe. We’re going to help Harry Tracy on a job. Careful on them trails. They’ll be looking harder for us now. -Ready? -It’s a new day, Butch. Get out. [grunts] Hold this a minute. Hey, Karl. Am I to understand you got money to buy whiskey but not pay for a chicken? Huh? I said I’d pay him next week. That doesn’t answer my question. [grunting] Okay, I’m sorry. I promise. [groaning] I won’t do it ag... No. You won’t. Theft will not be tolerated in Cheyenne. And I don’t give a damn if it’s a chicken, a hog, or a herd of cattle Now get. All of you, get. Come on, let’s go. You hard of hearing, mister? So this Karl fella, is he a big problem here in Cheyenne? No. That was his first offense. [chuckles] -Did I say something funny? -No. No. I just admire your brand of justice, Mr. Horn. It’s called the law around here. Fair enough. Is there something you want, Mr. Siringo? I’m bringing in Butch Cassidy and his Wild Bunch. Dead or alive. You may have heard that they killed an elder conductor over in Wilcox. Shot him in the back. They also murdered some local lawmen. Yeah, I heard something about that. But it was Kid Curry that did most of the killing, was it not? Nonetheless. Wild Bunch needs to be brought to justice. Hung by their necks, every last one of them. And I wanted to see if I could recruit you, Mr. Horn, in my endeavors. I’m pretty settled in here at the moment. Understood. You know... The bounty is up to $30,000 for the whole Wild Bunch. And I would be willing, Mr. Horn, to split that reward with you. 50/50. That’s a lot of money. It’s a lot of money. We’re awfully close to where we did that job in Wilcox, ain’t we? You know I want to be close to Alice Cassidy. Yeah. I keep forgetting about Miss Cassidy. What’s the local law like here? They know me, on account of Mike. As long as I don’t do nothing wrong in Dubois, they look the other way. And I intend to keep it like that. Plus another banker here helped Mike with all his affairs. Isom. You want that money that’s in my safe, why don’t you go on and get it? I told you, I don’t want no handout. Ain’t a handout, it’s a loan. I don’t want no loan, either. I told you I make the money myself. Do it just like you. When I’m ready. You gotta learn to commit to things, Isom. Going back and forth all the time, don’t make up your head about nothing. Gonna be the death of you one day. Mr. Santiago Maxwell, how are you? Good. I’m Fred Boone. No relation to Daniel Boone. -How are you? -I’m good, sir. I’m Ted... Hiddlebottom. So we are purchasing the Bartlett ranch just on the outskirts of our little town. - Correct, Mr. Maxwell? - Yes, sir, that’s right. I imagine we’ll be paying cash for this transaction? Or will it be in gold? -Cash. -Cash is still good. Oh, missing a few pages. I’ll be right back. Please, excuse me. How much does this man know about you, Butch? Asking if you’re paying in cash or gold? Relax. He’s only asking about... Don’t tell me to relax. All right? Does he or does he not know who you are? He knows who I am. Just like the local law. Fred altered Mike’s cattle and horse paperwork. Never steered him wrong in all them years. Here we go. If you gentlemen follow me, I can take care of you. This is the title and the deed, and I just need your signature here, here, here, and here. How is Alice these days? I’m hoping to help her out some. That explains why you wanted to purchase land there. You have a generous heart. Always in the right place. Now there’s just the actual money transfer. Wonderful. I won’t even bother to count it. Just kidding. I’m gonna get some fresh air. Your friend seems of the nervous sort. The money’s all there. You are now the proud owner of the Bartlet Ranch. Congratulations. - Thank you, Fred. - You’re welcome, as always. And please, give my regards to Mrs. Cassidy. One more thing for you. Some cookies from the "wife". Oh, thank you. I can’t wait to eat them. Oh, Mr. Maxwell... Just a little note about a gold mine. Wait until you’re out of town to read it. That man is the craziest banker I’ve ever seen in my life. Yeah, he might be strange, but he is helpful. What do you say we grab a drink to celebrate? -You buying? -Of course I am. I could use a drink. Hey! -Sorry, sir. -Watch it. Thought you said everyone in this town was friendly. Don’t know him. Hey, isn’t that that fella, Isom Dart? I think so. There’s a reward out for him. Excuse me, sirs. Hey, get back here! You say you never seen them guys before? Never. Hey, guess I gotta buy you that drink another time. Best to be clear out of here before they come to. Yeah, I agree with that. You want to come back to my ranch with me? I got to get back to the Hole in the Wall and make sure Elzy and ain’t get off with my share of the loot. Be careful now. We’ll all meet up again, soon. Of course, Butch. Hey, I appreciate you bringing me along today. It’s been real exciting. Think about what I said about the loan. I will. Get out of here. I’ll see you, Butch. Are you sure it was Isom Dart? Come on, Sheriff. Look who it is. ♪ Lord have mercy... Excuse me, sir. We need to talk to you. God damn. Turn around slowly. Don’t make any moves for that gun on your hip. Now, that’s Isom Dart. He’s wanted for cattle rustling. Isom Dart was arrested in Dubois. Well, well. Looks like we’re going to have to pay a little visit to Dubois. You look parched. Thank you, Alice. Why don’t you take a break? You know, it’s been a while since you’ve done this kind of work. I sure wish Mike could see you now. He’d be so proud of you. Oh, you still have his old pocket watch? Yeah, I do. There’s something else going on with you, ain’t there? Mike made all this look so easy. Mike made everything look easy. But answer me this. Why, after all them years, do you want to come back to what you left? Alls I know is I want something more than robbing banks and trains. If that makes sense. Sure it does. Kid Curry killing that poor conductor didn’t help none either. Mike never killed nobody. No, he didn’t. But he sure came close a couple of times. Excuse me. Did either of you lose a horse? I found a wild one over yonder hill grazing on my property. Wouldn’t let me near it. Must be old Billy. Let him wander from time to time. You’re not worried someone’s gonna snatch him? I do apologize for the inconvenience. He usually manages to find his way back home. Well, I see you’re working on a fence. That’s a start. I’m Alice, miss. -And you are? -Etta. Etta Place. -Pleasure to meet you. -And you. Well, your horse has a name. I reckon you have one, too. Robert Parker, miss. Nice to meet you, Robert Parker. Could be straighter. Yeah. Guess I don’t got such a great eye for straight lines. That’s an easy fix. Got some twine? Rope? Thin rope. -No. -I’ll be back. Think I’m in love. Robert Parker, you don’t even know what it’s like to be in love. This town smells of shit. Do you ever say anything pleasant, Mr. Horn? How do you want to go about this? What I want is to find out where they are. No matter what it takes. I hold now status of law outside of Cheyenne, Mr. Siringo. I noticed you don’t wear badge. So how is it that you attained your position of authority in Cheyenne, exactly, Mr. Horn? Understood. This is your lucky day. Oh... It’s official. You’re a Pinkerton now. Thank you for your help today, Etta. It was my pleasure. Always happy to lend a helping hand to a new neighbor. As long as I don’t find his horse on my property again. That’d be such a bad thing? How did you get so handy? Well, my dad was a cattle man and I was an only child. He wasted no time putting me to work on that ranch. You know, there was this one time when Mike was trying to teach Robert how to saddle a horse, all proper and all. And Robert wasn’t having none of it. And Mike was trying to tell him, a horse keeps air in its belly, so you got to wait to cinch those straps. And Robert snaps back, "I know how to ride a horse, Mike. I ain’t no kid." And he was like 16 years old, mind you. And what happened? Well, he spurred ol’ Cinco and he took off. And sure enough, that saddle slid to the right and Robert fell off over the fence into the pig slop. It was a mess. Mike wouldn’t let him come in the house for a week. Made him sleep in the barn. I would’ve done the same thing. Get out. [grunting] [gunshot] Hey, hey! Watch where you’re going. Bob! Bob! Who you running from, mister? Move on. Mr. Horn, Isom’s been sentenced. He’s going to serve his time. Leave him be, Sheriff. You were seen with Butch Cassidy and the Wild Bunch at the Wilcox train robbery. [screams] I ain’t going to ask you again. I ain’t telling you nothing, you goddamn Pinkerton. I could put a few more bullets in that leg of yours. And you will never use that leg again. Or you can tell me what I want to know. Go to hell, you son of a bitch. Mr. Horn, no! [gunshot] I was hoping Isom Dart would give up Butch Cassidy’s location. But... I guess I should have just asked you. You see, a reliable source informed me... that the local law, that’d be you, looks the other way here in Dubois. That Butch Cassidy frequents Dubois. And has for some time. I’d really hate to start killing off fellow law enforcement to get what I need. There’s no need for that, Detective. Butch used to stay out at Mike and Alice Cassidy’s ranch. But if you want the whole gang, your best bet is to find them at the Hole in the Wall. The Hole in the Wall. That pass out there in Big Horn mountains? Yes, sir. I hear that’s where the Wild Bunch meet up after a robbery. You’re likely to find them all there. That’s what I hear. You know where that place is? Yes, I do. You know... I don’t take kindly to the law overlooking fugitives. Butch Cassidy never created no problems here, Mr. Siringo, Never conducted no illegal activities. I would have locked him up if he had. I mean, in his defense... he kind of helped out around here. Picking up a hammer to fix a leaky roof or give money to poor folk. He never created no trouble here in Dubois, I promise. He sounds like a real saint. Pick up that trash off the street. Yes, sir, I will. Were those stories Alice was telling embarrassing you? Because they shouldn’t. They’re cute. No, it just makes you miss Mike, is all. Yeah, I miss my parents, too. Why do you call them Mike and Alice and not mom and dad? They ain’t my real parents. Ran away from home when I was young, and I met Mike when I got caught stealing food from the grocery store. He offered to pay for it and asked me if I wanted a job on his ranch. Kind of ended up being like a father to me. Guess they sort of adopted me. Well, that’s mighty generous. So you live alone? I live with my man. Oh. Where’s he at? When do I get to meet him? Well, he’s out of town for a spell. I don’t even know if you’d like him. Probably wouldn’t get along. He’s different from you, that’s for sure. -How so? -Well, he’s loud. Very loud. And he dresses fancy. Fancy? Don’t seem like you’d be with a kind of fella like that. Yeah, well, I like fancy. What about you? -What about me? -Why don’t you have a girl? Yes. I guess I just haven’t made time for it. Maybe I haven’t met the right one yet. [panting] I say we take our chances and go in. Patience, Mr. Horn. Patience. -Hey, Maude? -Yeah, baby? I’m through with patience. [grunts] You got him. She’s still moving. Hole in the Wall. I heard stories about this place. Yeah, it looks like someone was here, but left in a hurry. Yeah, who knows? Gunshots look like they echoed pretty good in here. I should have thought about that. Who is she? This is Maude Davis, the woman to the now deceased William "Elzy" Ellsworth here. [Maude groans] She’s not going to make it. Now we have to find this Alice Cassidy. How do you wish to proceed? With extreme caution. Butch... Butch! I got a visit from the U.S. Marshal’s Office this morning. They said Mike owes years of back taxes and they’re going to seize the ranch for payment. I can’t lose his ranch. I can’t. Nobody’s going to take your ranch from you, Alice. All right? What’s all this? It’s all them papers they handed me about how Mike owes the state money and such. I can’t understand all this law talk. Is Etta around? Maybe she can make some sense out of it. No, I ain’t seen her in a few days. I don’t know what I’m going to do. Go see Fred at the bank. He’ll know what to do. He always does. Maybe it’s too soon for you to go back into town. You let me worry about that. I’m a mother, I worry about everything. Hello, Alice. Hello, Fred. So nice to see you again. Mr. Maxwell. What’s all this about? Alice has a little paperwork problem she’d like you to look at. Let me see what you got. Our government at times can be so perverse. Robbing a widow of all she has left. It’s despicable. And there you go. These papers officially state that all back taxes have been paid in full. But I didn’t pay you anything. These papers say you did. Right there. But somehow the funds were lost in transit to the governor’s office. But that’s not what happened. It won’t be a problem. You and Mike have been customers here since I was a kid, sweeping up the floors. You deserve to live out life peacefully and not be constrained by our money-hungry government. Thank you, Fred. Hands where I can see them. Make a move with your gun, it’ll be the last thing you do, I assure you. Place it on the table for me, won’t you? Do I know you? Nope. I heard a story about a man once carved a combination to a safe into his pistol. You know something about that? I reckon a lot of men done that one time or another. Ooh, careful now. Our government will take you for everything. Howdy, señor. Would you mind filling up a bag for me, please? You know what? Make it two. Oh, and go easy on the coins, would you? They get heavy. What are you looking at? Your bank’s getting robbed. Thank you very much, sir. Have yourself a nice rest of your day. And as for the rest of you, have yourself a good day, too. It is a beautiful day outside. The sun is shining. It’s good to be alive. Whoo! That was exciting. Well, I do have a claim to file now. And alert the sheriff. And those back property taxes you’ve paid, they were just stolen. You see? Everything works out. Thank you for taking me to see Fred. He’s always been such a nice man. Are you sure you didn’t know who that bank robber was? No, never seen him before. Are you okay? Go get on your horse and ride home. I’ll catch up to you. What is it? Trouble. You be safe. Hands up. Hold it right there. That’s far enough. You’re that fella that robbed that bank, ain’t you? Why are you following me? Would you believe me if I said I wasn’t following you? No, sir, I would not. You really ought to think about removing those numbers from your gun, Butch Cassidy. You told my girl your name was Robert Parker. Who’s your girl? Etta Place. Should have used that other name you throw around. What is it? Maxwell Sanchez. I’m Harry Longbaugh. You can call me Sundance. Sundance Kid. I know I’m not as famous as you yet, but I aim to be. I have some information to give you. It’s important. But first, would you mind putting that gun down? I can be a lot more useful to you alive than dead. Thank you. Well, what do you got to tell me? I have been told from a reliable source that the Pinkerton Detective Agency is looking for you. Fellow by the name of Charlie Siringo and a no good gun for hire, Tom Horn out of Cheyenne. -You heard of them? -Yeah, who hasn’t? Word is Siringo and Horn killed Elzy Lay and Maude Davis at the Hole in the Wall. Who told you all this? There’s an old fella in the town of Cody keeps me informed of things, seeing as how the town is just yonder of the Hole in the Wall. And I’m sorry to keep on as such, but I don’t know if you heard about what they did to Isom back in Dubois. What about Isom? Siringo and Horn dragged him out of his cell asking questions about you. Isom wouldn’t give anything up. Horn shot him dead. Cold blood. Heard old Bob Meeks had a hand in it, too. Bob Meeks? You sure about that? From what I hear, he handed Isom right to him. You’ve been so holed up with your new ranch life, you don’t even know what’s going on out there in the world, do you? You need to be looking over your shoulder from now on, Butch. But if you need anything, you know where to find Etta and me. Alice. Mrs. Cassidy. Is there by any chance, anyone with you? If you’re with the U.S. Marshal’s office, I got the paperwork there. Now leave me alone. You ain’t taking my land. We’re not here about your land, ma’am. We’re with the Pinkerton Detective Agency and we’re looking for a known fugitive. [gasps] A fugitive we were told by a reliable source was here. Who? Butch. Cassidy. Butch Cassidy, the bank robber? Same last name, gentlemen, but no relation. Yes, yes, we know that, but are you expecting him anytime soon? I don’t. Why would I? Then tell us where we can find him. I think I already answered that question. Mrs. Cassidy... Just tell us where we can find him, ma’am, and we’ll be on our way. Don’t... Please don’t make this difficult. Is this what you detectives do now? Come into little old ladies homes, a huffing and a puffing and making up stories that make you feel bigger than you really are? Huffing and puffing. Have you ever heard of a man named Elmer McCurdy, Mrs. Cassidy? No, I ain’t heard of him neither. Excuse me. Would either one of you gentlemen like some tea or coffee? No, ma’am. Coffee, Please. Well, truth be told, I’d be surprised if you said you had heard of him. Elma McCurdy was a lowlife bank and train robber, much like your Butch, in fact. Though not nearly as well known. And as is the usual fate of men in McCurdy’s chosen profession, the day came that he was shot down in the street like a rabid dog in a violent gunfight with the law. Justice served. Then the strangest thing happened. A man arrived in town professing to be McCurdy’s long lost brother. Identified him as such, claimed the body. Took it away. Ah, but it was soon learned that man had lied because, in fact, McCurdy had no brother. And that stranger, he was, in fact... the owner of a little traveling carnival show. You know, the kind that likes to put on display dead outlaw’s mummified remains. Gruesome business, but no doubt a profitable one for that little traveling show. But as a mother, I’m sure you’ll agree, such an undignified end to the life of young Elmer McCurdy. I cannot imagine how... ashamed and heartbroken his mother must have been when she found out about all that. Tell me, Mrs. Cassidy, do you like. carnival attractions? No, I don’t. Ah! Now, if you’ll excuse me, gentlemen. Mr. Horn. [gunshot] Oh! Alice! Alice! Are you all right? What happened? This is all my fault. No... I love you with all my heart. Hey. Who’s there? Answer me. Show yourself. Mike? I watched you die out there, Mike. I get that, son. And you better get this. Charlie Siringo didn’t want me. He wanted you. Alice never forgave herself for not stopping you that day. Not stopping the both of us. Her thinking that you were dead... I watched her die a little bit every single day. Blaming herself. And laying on the street dying, almost... bleeding. I was sharp enough to give him an alias so he couldn’t track me back to you and her. I’m not sure they believe me. They didn’t think I was reliable. So you know what they did? Lock him up. Put him in the goddamn prison. Five years. I did my time, son. Three weeks ago, they let me out. I was still afraid that Siringo would follow me to you. Siringo still killed Alice, didn’t he? Yes. So why are you here now? I regretted never being able to go back to her. To hold her, to comfort her. I let her down. That’s on me. You still ain’t answered my question. Why are you here? You’re the same kid as you were when you were real young. Turd-headed big time. You can get it done. You still in love with that. That’ll get you one day or another. You go after Siringo by yourself, you know what’s going to happen? You’re going to end up just exactly like me. You’ll be in prison. You’ll do time. And if that doesn’t happen, he will find you and you will be dead. That’s a chance I’m willing to take. So are you with me or not? No, son. I’m not. You’re going to let them get away with it? They took Alice from us. Yes, they did. I’ll handle it again myself. Just like I did in Sweetwater. Who’s there? Reckon I might find you here. Where’s Ben and Laura? Away. Who’s that there? Some fellow thought he could cross me. A couple of Pinkerton detectives are looking for us. Ain’t nothing can’t be handled. I wanted to see if you and the others were up for another job. Yeah, like last time with your pal, Bob? No, thank you. Siringo and Horn are coming for us and they ain’t going to stop until they kill us. I say we get to them first. Rob the Southern Rail down in Folsom. Ambush and kill them at the same time. What happened to your no killing rule? They tortured Isom before killing him. Bob Meeks had a hand in that too. Where did you hear this? Outlaw I ran into. Calls himself Sundance. Never heard of him. They killed Elzy and Maude. They murdered Alice. They killed Alice? They left a note telling me that I couldn’t hide from ’em and I’m gonna kill ’em with or without you. Let me see your gun. So you really got it in you to do this? I’ve never raised my gun to kill a man, but I’d shoot the devil between the eyes if I could. The Great Train robber Butch Cassidy out for revenge. I like that. You can’t let them get away for what they did to Alice. But how do you know they’re going to show up at the train station? There’s a banker at the Wyoming National Bank in Dubois, handled all of Mike and Alice’s affairs. Mine, too. Fred. He’s a good man. He won’t readily give anything up to him, but we’ve all heard of Horn’s methods on getting fellows to talk. Except for Isom. So how do you know they’re going to go to the bank? Because that note they left me written on one of Alice’s property papers from the bank. Fred gives up the location of my ranch, which he definitely will, I’ll make sure to leave something there for them that’ll lead them straight to Folsom. Whether they show up or not, you can have all the money. All right. You let him go, let’s you and I get to it. He ain’t going nowhere. He’s counting worms. Come on, I’ll take you to them. [grunts] Please. I don’t understand. What have I done, detectives? Is that blood? Now Butch Cassidy came into your bank here with Alice Cassidy, and they had you forge that document. I’m sorry. He threatened me. -I was afraid he was... -[thud] Ah! I was afraid he was going to kill me. That’s not the way he works. You and I both know that, don’t we? Now, you’re not in trouble for the forged document. You sold some land at Butch Cassidy a while back. I did. But that was a perfectly legal transaction. Where’s it located? Where the road comes to a fork. Alice Cassidy’s house is on the eastern trail, right? So, Butch Cassidy’s house is off the western. It’s called the Bartlet Ranch. You follow the western trail around down through some small hills, and it sits at the base amongst the trees. It’s a small house. You can’t miss it. You wouldn’t lie to us, would you? No, sir. Absolutely not. I would consider him a friend, but... Sometimes you have to think about yourself, right? One last thing, sir. Do you happen to know if Butch Cassidy has any company right now? Every time I’ve seen him, he’s always been in the presence of Alice. Sirs... Whose blood is on the paper? Just be thankful that it isn’t yours. Appreciate your help. We riding out to Cassidy’s place? Not just yet. Let’s pay a little visit to Sheriff Beck. See if he and his men can atone for their sins. Please, don’t shoot. Not to worry, ma’am. We mean you no harm. We’re looking for a known fugitive. Butch Cassidy. This... This is his residence, is it not? Robert Parker lives here. Mr. Parker and Mr. Cassidy are one and the same. I did not know that. -So is he inside? -No, he’s not. Move aside, ma’am. Step down for me. What is your name? Ethel. Ethel Porter. You don’t mind me asking, what is your relationship to Butch? Or should I say Mr. Parker. House is empty. Your relationship, ma’am? He’s my neighbor. I live over yonder. We met a while back. He asked me to look in on the place and tidy up a bit. And do his laundry? That’s neighborly of you. Did he happen to mention where he went? He was riding on down to Folsom to meet up with some old friends. Don’t move. -Do you believe her? -I do. Only because the Southern Pacific Railroad stops there to distribute payroll. To the rail construction sites. That would be a big take for them. And she mentioned he was meeting up with old friends. It could be Curry and his crew. Very well could be. Which means we’re going to need a little help. Am I in trouble, sirs? No, ma’am, you’re not. Thank you for the information. Oh, just a little suggestion. I strongly advise you not to fraternize with no criminals. It’s not particularly good for your health. Good day. [chuckles] Looks like they fell for it. You okay, darlin’? Yeah. Come here, come here. I’m here. I’m here. What happened? I for sure thought Butch was wrong about two lawmen killing Alice Cassidy, but... Now I believe him. Yeah, and they’re gonna get what’s coming to ’em, I promise you. But now I got to go saddle up and let Butch know - they’re on their way. - I don’t want you to go. -Why? -I just don’t trust it. You wanted me to help Butch out in the first place. I know, I know, but you didn’t see them. They have a devil in their eyes. I’ve seen them. I’ve seen them. I just don’t... I don’t want you getting killed over his personal vendetta... No matter how wrong it was them killing Alice Cassidy. I just don’t trust it. I know. I know you don’t. But I’m not a fan of giving someone my word and not following through on it, Etta. We may need his help one day. I’ll come back to you. [bell ringing] Bank guards. Yeah, I see ’em. I don’t see Sundance. Don’t need him, anyway. Horn and Siringo show, there’s four of us. I like them odds. That’s a good score. Good afternoon, gentlemen. We’ll take it from here. I’d drop those guns to the ground. Nice and slow. Nice and slow. Good. Get out of here. [laughing] Ooh-wee. Where are these Pinkertons? If they ain’t here by the time that money’s loaded up, Butch, you’re on your own. We’re here for the money. You’re here for revenge. [trains whistle blows] [grunts] This is heavy. [gunfire] [horse whinnies] [grunts] Whoa. [gunfire continues] [grunts] Ah! I’ve been shot! Get over here. Die, you son of a bitch. -No. -What are you doing? I told you I want him alive. You shoot that girl, you’re going to jail with ’em. Do you understand me, Mr. Horn? Drop that gun or I’ll put a bullet in this little girl’s head. Put ’em down. Son of a bitch. Butch! He’s not gonna shoot. -[grunting] -Butch! [laughing] Don’t you do it. Don’t! Oh, shit! I got him. I got him. Butch, get out of here, go. I ain’t leaving you. You’re worth more to us alive than dead, Butch. We’ll get ’em another day. -Go. -I ain’t leaving you. Go on. Get. -Go! -Go. I’ll draw him away from us, all right? [groans] No, I’ll handle this. [gunfire] Take that hand off your wound and raise it up. Do you think you can get it? Get your back up against the wall. Now get. Sheriff Beck, retrieve their guns. - What about these three? - They’re not going anywhere. Sheriff Beck, watch them, if you please. Where the hell were you? With Etta. -Is she okay? -She’s fine. [gunshot] Ah! -I got him. -They shot me. Come on. Come on. Get up. Well, well, well. Look at this. This is a most prosperous day. Two of the most dangerous outlaws in the West at the same time. Only difference between the two of you and us is them fake badges you wear. Tie them up, Mr. Horn. -Give me your hands. -Stop. Holster that gun, Mr. Siringo. Or you’re a dead man. Oh, you wouldn’t like her when she’s mad. Drop them, boys. Thought you two could need a little help. Turns out I was right. That’s my girl. I told you she was lying to us. I heard about your methods, Horn. Is it you who killed Alice? Yes. But if it’s any consolation to you, at least she died with some dignity. Unlike your yellow belly friends. Ellsworth, Maude and Isom Dart. She was shot in the back. What difference does it make? She was just another filthy whore that had what was coming to her. Well, so much for the legend that you never killed a man. Now question is, what do we do with Detective Siringo here? Is it true what Horn said? You didn’t have nothing to do with killing Alice or them others? Don’t matter, Butch. He used Horn. He’s got just as much blood on his hands even if he didn’t pull the trigger. I say we kill him right now and be done with it. No, no, no. Take off your belt, Mr. Siringo. -Nice and slow. -What? Why? -Then what? -We tie him up. And then what, Butch? What the hell did you do? He’s going for his holdout gun. It was either us or them, Butch. And good damn riddance. Nothing but a bunch of filthy cockroaches. The both of them. He’s a Pinkerton detective, Sundance. Only gonna have more coming looking for us now. Well, then we better get going now, shouldn’t we? What about all that money from the Folsom train? Back at the station. You didn’t even get the damn loot? There’s no way I could have loaded it up on my horse, all them bullets flying. Well, it’d be kind of a shame to leave all that money behind. We can go back and get it. Now we’re making sense. Thank you for saving the day, darling. Whoa. Put that down. I’m sorry. Charlie Siringo threatened to kill all of us if we didn’t help him. You go on and get out of here. Make sure I don’t see you again. Didn’t think you’d come back for us. Yeah, I came back. Let’s get you on our of here now. Let’s get out share of the loot and split up before any more of the law shows up. What about Siringo and Horn? Counting worms. Killed ’em? You don’t got to worry about them no more. Your take. What? That’s it? Come on, fellas. The three of us make a pretty good bunch. Yeah, I reckon. Did you want to come with me? I mean, it’s not a bad idea. It’s only a matter of time before the law comes looking for us. Yeah. They’re going to find our home sooner or later. True. They might even be waiting for us when we get back. This ain’t going to get us too far. Yeah, we’ll probably have to pull a few more jobs along the way. You up for it? Oh, yeah. Well, you know I’m in. Let’s ride.
