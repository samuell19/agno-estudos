Mr. Lin. Mr. Lin. Please put your hands through here. Sit there. Are you Chien-yi Lin? Yes. Your date of birth? 17 March 1972. ID number? Mr. Lin. You've agreed to be questioned on murder and drug charges. You're not obligated to answer and may remain silent. You may request investigation into evidence beneficial to you. You also have the right to an attorney... What are you doing here? Have you greeted your uncle? No. Go greet your uncle. I don't know him well. Silly. He'll give you a red envelope. Don't you want one? Yes. Then go. How old were you when I last saw you? 3 or 4? Don't remember? Nevermind. Here. Call me "Uncle" and I'll give you a red envelope. Uncle. I've over here, not there. Here you go. Happy New Year. May you grow up happily. Happy New Year. Gong Xi Fa Cai. OK. Go wash your hands. You haven't been back for so long. Go burn incense for your father and big brother. OK. What a big packet. To our ancestors. Today is the day before Chinese New Year's Eve. As your unfilial daughter-in-law, I kindly ask all of you to return for the family reunion. Li-wei, you must come back too. Mom, the ocean view condominium seems nice. Housing prices should have gone up recently. I know what you're thinking. Don't get any ideas about my house. You must be back because you need money again. What are you talking about? Things are different now. My business is doing very well. You can live with me over there soon. So you have no plans to move back then. Fine. I understand. I have my own plans too. What plans? Let me help. Stop playing and wash your hands. After this stage. Yo-yu. C'mon. It's Chinese New Year. I'm going to head up first. Eat with us. -Enough. Sit and eat. OK. Let's start. Thanks. Happy New Year. Happy New Year. What do you say next? Gong Xi Fa Cai. And then? Red envelope is mine! I'll give you one later. Are you full? Use this one. The doctor said not to apply unprescribed ointments. You don't want to do it? If you are reluctant, you don't have to serve me like this. Do you think doing all this for me would bring my son back from the dead? That's impossible. I know. As long as you do. I was afraid you'd forgotten. She was still healthy at Chinese New Year! Where's my mom? Here. Please verify that it's Mrs. Chou. Yo-yu, go get ready for bed. What am I going to do about him? If I take him with me, I worry he wont' be used to it over there. Li-gang, I've already adopted Yo-yu. (Title Deed) (Property Owner: Yo-yu Wang) Yo-yu. Uncle has something important to ask you. Did Grandma really die because she was sick? What really happened? Did Lin tell you not to say? You can't trust that guy. You can't trust him. He's my dad. Li-wei is your dad, not him. He adopted me. That's because... He wants our house. Grandma gave you the house. Since he adopted you, he's... He can take our house. If someone... tries to steal from us, shouldn't we gang up against him? I'm your real family. I'll take you to the police. Let's go tell the police. No. -Let's go, I'll take you to the police. Let's go. -I don't want to! Yo-yu. Did you see your uncle? Hurry up. Ready? 1, 2, 3. OK, look. We're up to this "Re" here, right? Yo-yu, do you want a cookie? No, thanks. Director, please sign here. Mom! -Hsiao-chih. Mr. Lin. We just went on a trip to Japan. This is for you. Thank you. Come, Hsiao-chih. Say bye to Mr. Lin. Bye! Say bye to the Director. Bye! Bye -Bye, Mr. Lin. It must be hard for you to have to work at a time like this. Let's share this with everyone. Where's Yo-yu? He's inside. Hello? Yes, that's me. Li-gang? Mr. Lin? Hello? Mr. Lin? Yes. Please head inside. Turn right at the end. OK. Mr. Lin? Yes, that's me. Did you bring ID? The prosecutor is still in the coroner's lab. Please wait. OK. Mrs. Chou really doted on her grandson. Yes. Ever since his father passed, he's been closest to his grandma. When Mrs. Chou transferred the property to Yo-yu, had you already discussed adoption? Transferred...? You didn't know? What transfer? You didn't know Mrs. Chou transferred her property to Yo-yu? It's the first I've heard of it. So... This is why I'm being...? Mr. Lin, can you please explain in more detail your relationship with this family? I already told you. I'm a tenant living in their rooftop add-on. I know that. But you also said you take care of all their household needs. You even pay for their daily living expenses. Ordinary tenants wouldn't do that. The kid's father and I were together. Excuse me, you said... Li-wei and I were a couple. Then Yo-yu is... The child he had with his ex-wife. Does the child know about this? Mrs. Chou wouldn't let me tell him. Why didn't you move out after Li-wei passed away? If I were a woman who lost her husband, and had been taking care the family, would you be asking me the same question? Little boy. We're the police. Can you open the door for us? Is there an adult at home? Police! Police! Open up! Police! Open up! What took you so long? I was washing dishes in the kitchen. We have a search warrant. Please let us in. I'm about to take the kid to school. Can you do it after I take him? No, we're conducting the search right now. He's got an exam today. Can't he go to school? Fine, I'll get a colleague to take him to school. Yo-yu, a police officer will take you to school. Call me if you need anything. Good luck with the exam. Let me explain it to you first. During the search, you are allowed to stay and watch. But you may not touch anything without my permission. Got it? What are you looking for? Is there anyone else on the premises? No, just me and the kid. What are you looking for? If you have hidden any illegal drugs, take them out now. It'll save us turning this place upside down. What illegal drugs? 6-Acetylmorphine was detected in the deceased's blood. This is typically a metabolite of drugs like heroin or morphine. Was the deceased using such drugs? Mrs. Chou used to buy medicines from radio infomercials. Maybe there was something in the ingredients. Tsai, bag all of the medications. Why do you have a tent here? The kid likes to play in it. Hey, take a look inside. OK. Who is the guy next to you? Li-wei. Yo-yu's father. Sergeant Kuo. Doesn't look like there's anything unusual. Could he have deleted it? Can you see what he deleted recently? You think we won't find out if you delete it? What? The hookup app on your phone. Why did you delete it? Afraid we'd find something? No. I was afraid the kid would accidentally press on it. So I deleted it. You adopted a little boy, yet you're hooking up with random men. That's not a good look. Who have you hooked up with? If you're not going to say anything, I'll just have to ask the people close to you. Starting from your place of work. Excuse me. Are you threatening me? I'm investigating a case! This is my job. Threatening you? Sergeant Kuo, the prosecutor's on the phone. Prosecutor, we've already got a dead old woman. If we release him now, what if... If something happens to that child, it'll be too late for regrets. Prosecutor, please reconsider. Sorry. I'm here. Sorry. You're here early. Hsiao-chih... You're performing soon. Work a little harder, OK? Bye. Bye. Take care. Bye. Come in. Why does Hsiao-chih have a different teacher? I should be the one asking what's going on. The police came by asking questions. What did they want to know? Your financial situation. And... your relationship status. The parents are all talking about it. I have to consider how they feel. Feel free to play with any of the toys here. Welcome. Where's Yo-yu? Still in counseling. (Stop Domestic Violence, Stop Sexual Abuse) You don't think that I would... I don't know. That's why I brought him here. Li-gang, can you just hear me out? No need. Go tell the prosecutor. Can't we have a proper discussion? There's nothing to discuss. Yo-yu is all I have left. I can't let him... grow up in an abnormal environment. Abnormal? I love this child with all my heart. Just like you. What "abnormal" are you talking about? Yo-yu. Are you OK? Yo-yu. Stop, it's dangerous over there. Yo-yu. Who are you? I'm Lin. Who is Lin? Why do you have so many secrets? I don't have any secrets. Did you adopt me because of the house? Do you think I'm that kind of person? Stop pretending! You're all just using me. I'm not... Then why won't you tell me the truth? Why won't you tell me? Why? Hey. The usual? Yeah. Is that him? Yeah, it's probably him. He looks kind of dopey in person. Those profile pics are all too fake. What a scam. I'll be back for the coffee. He's leaving. Eric. We have some questions to ask you. Please come back to the station with us. I'm really busy. Why don't you just ask your questions here? Do you know Lin? Show him the photo. Eric! Stop! Stop! Ouch! Let go! That hurts! That hurts! Let go! What's in your left pocket? Take it out! Ouch... What? What's this? You're finished. What kind of relations do you have with Lin? The kind of relations you have with your wife. Keep it up. I can do this all day. Can I get a lawyer? Or can you get me one? You want a lawyer? OK. Here. Use this phone. While you look for a lawyer, I'll get a search warrant for your residence. You've already been busted once. Will your mother be able to handle a second time? Work with us and I'll tell the prosecutor you've been cooperative. That makes a big difference. How did you first meet Lin? How many times have you met? Where? What did you do and talk about? Tell us everything. I'm here. You shouldn't repress yourself. Call me if you want to hook up again. I'm going to go. So on the night of June 3rd, he contacted you again. What did he want this time? What did he say to you? Prosecutor, Eric confessed. Lin bought fentanyl from him the night before Mrs. Chou's death. Sergeant Kuo. He's not here. They said Lin already resigned. He's not at home either. Sergeant Kuo. Wait, we got someone to open the door. I'll take a look inside first. Call you later. I told you he is suspicious, but you didn't arrest him. You only come now after he's gone. What if something happens to the child? He's only 9 years old. Now what? Where's the tent? Which is redial button? Hello? I called earlier to make a reservation. I just want to confirm the date again. Mr. Lin. L-I-N And your address is...? Yo-yu. Yo-yu. Yo-yu. Yo-yu. Look. Filled it up? Yes. We got divorced. How about your kid? He stays with me. Are you OK? I'm tired. I work 2 jobs a day to pay off my brother's debts. He racked up a bunch of debts and fled to China. I went to get life insurance earlier. When I signed, it occurred to me: I'm now worth more dead than alive. Don't say stuff like that. Why don't I move in with you? Aren't you looking for a tenant? You want to look after me? Yeah. Yo-yu. Yo-yu. Yo-yu. Get up. Yo-yu, come on. What is it? Yo-yu. I'm sorry. I might not be able to protect you from now on. What do you mean? The police are coming to get me. But didn't you say...? It's OK. Don't be nervous. Don't be scared. It's OK. Yo-yu. In the future, you might encounter a lot of annoying and confusing things. Like right now. But you must remember: These things are not your fault. I might not be by your side from now on, but I hope you can remember that I will always, always love you. Lin! Police! We have a warrant for your arrest! Please come out right now! I'll cooperate! There's a child in here. Don't scare him. Don't go. Lin! Come out or we're going in! I'm coming out! Yo-yu, you've grown up. Put your hands up! Don't forget. In March this year, using a dating app, you met a man named Eric. On June 3rd, you purchased from him the Class 2 drug fentanyl. Is that correct? May I remind you, Eric has already confessed. Remaining silent is not in your best interests. Mr. Lin. If you don't say anything, the judge will only have the testimony of Li-gang and Eric. I'll also call Yo-yu and other key witnesses to testify. These people will only say what's in their best interests. I want to confess. What did you say? I bought the fentanyl. I also killed her. It hurts. It hurts. Mrs. Chou. What's wrong? It hurts. Take your medicine. I've already taken it. It really hurts. It hurts. -I'll take you to the hospital. Actually, you really are very handsome. What are you talking about? - No wonder my son... fell in love with you. My leg... My leg... The doctor's taken care of it. I don't have much longer to live. Don't say stuff like that. It's my body. I know it best. Say... Can you go by the court and ask what kind of procedures are needed for an adoption? Are you listening to me? Yes. Hello, Sir. Hi. We're a little later than usual today. It's OK, take your time. -OK. Mrs. Chou... Enough. Stop taking more. Yo-yu. Come over here. Whose signature is this? Lin. I know it says Lin. But who is he to you? My dad. You dad? He's lying. That guy's not his dad. Shut up, Yang. Teacher already asked last term. He's just a tenant at his house. I told you to shut up! Yo-yu! Calm down. It's OK if he's a tenant. You can tell the truth. I just want to know more about you. You're not in any trouble. Go back to your seat. Let's button up. Why are you adopting me? So I can keep looking after you. Sleeves. Wouldn't your life be easier without me? But you make my life happier. OK. Don't be so cynical. Come on. Stand up straight. Smile. Forget it. Don't smile. All right. Let's put on your pants. What's wrong? It hurts. It hurts. Hold on. It hurts. Are you really in pain? What do you mean? Are you saying I'm faking it? Of course not. Where does it hurt now? You have the gall to ask me where it hurts? I'm hurting inside! Ever since my son died because of you, I've been in pain for the past 5 years. It's OK. Go put your pants on. Why did she say my dad died because of you? What does she mean? Mrs. Chou, do you agree to hand over custody of Yo-yu to Mr. Lin? Grandma. Grandma. Do you understand what I said? I was just asking you whether you indeed agree to allow Mr. Lin to adopt your grandson. I agree. Does she have hearing problems or...? Grandma took some medicine this morning, so she's a little slow. What illness does Grandma have? Diabetes. Yo-yu, how old are you? Do you know what being adopted means? Yes. It means Lin is going to become my dad. Do you want Lin to be your dad? What is it? What are you thinking about? Once he adopts me, do I have to call him "Dad"? It's not a hard rule. Do you want to call him "Dad"? No. Then what do you want to call him? Dad Mark Il. Mr. Lin, I still have some questions for you. You... We will arrange for a social worker to visit your home. The whole process will take some time... This button, right? Thanks. -OK, no problem. Thanks a lot. You're welcome. OK, ready? Look happy, little boy. OK. (I wish you were here too...) Don't be too good to me. How do I answer this question? Don't bother me right now. What don't you understand? This question. It rhymes better if you change this to "wing". Impressive. Have you been using unprescribed ointments again? This needs to be operated on immediately. I'll transfer you to the surgical department. What kind of operation? I suspect Grandma is in the early stages of sepsis. We may have to amputate, or else her life could be at risk. Take me home. Don't be like this. Take me home. What are you looking for? Painkillers. You already finished them, remember? Didn't I tell you to buy more? Why won't you listen to me? We need to go back to the hospital for more pills. Back to the hospital? The hospital means more medicine. It means dialysis. And amputating my leg. Will that cure me? Say it! It won't! Right? Why do I have to live in such agony? Hospital every day. Medicine, dialysis, amputation. Then more medicine, dialysis, amputation. Why do I have to suffer so much? Don't be like this. Then I beg you. Don't let me suffer anymore. I beg you. Lin, there's something I've always wanted to ask you. What is it? When my son was with you, was he happy? Yes. That's good. In fact, I stopped blaming you a long time ago. You need to stop blaming yourself too, OK? I don't have what you asked for, but this is a painkiller too. This is powerful stuff. If an elderly person is taking it, never give more than half a tablet. Thank you. Are you OK? Yo-yu. Yo-yu. Get up. Get up. Go turn on the light for Grandma. The light's already on. What light? There's no light. It's dark. I'll go get Lin. No. Don't. Don't wake him. Let him rest. Tell Grandma: Did he bring my medicine back? Yes. Get it for Grandma. I will feel better after taking medicine. OK. Grandma. Grandma can't see. Can you feed it to me? OK. I need 3 more. 3 more. Yo-yu. Give me your hand. Let me tell you. Lin will take good care of you. Listen to what he says, OK? Understand? Understood. Look. Your dad's here. Long time no see. Are you happy? Look. Your son is so big now. Look. Quick. Yo-yu, say hi to your dad. Your dad is smiling. Look. Say "Dad". Dad. Good. That's a good boy. Look how happy your dad is. Look at your dad's smile. Li-wei, how have you been? Are you taking me with you? Mom. Thank you for treating me as family. I promise to take good care of Yo-yu. No more medicine. No more dialysis. From now on, no more suffering. Grandma's gone. Is it because I gave her so many pills? It's not your fault. It's not your fault. I took the pills home and gave them to Grandma and let her sleep. Did you know it would put her life at risk? Yes. I did. Did you take the child into the mountains to avoid being arrested? Or was there another purpose? Mr. Lin. Why did you take the child into the mountains? Great work, Prosecutor. You too. I heard the suspect has confessed. Yes. But there are many points that still need clarifying. What about the child? Did you get his statement? He's still in a state of shock, so I asked his uncle to take him home first. I'll go get his statement once he's stable. Oh, there's this... I found it in the child's backpack. I don't know if this should be used as evidence. Please take a look. Thank you. Hi. I'll go get him. OK. Yo-yu. Can you open the door? The prosecutor wants to speak with you. He's been like this since he got back. Let me try. Yo-yu. Hi, I'm Prosecutor Chang. Don't be scared. I'm just here to return your note book. There's a letter Lin wrote you inside it. Can we have a chat after you've read it? Take your time. I'll be waiting outside. Dear Yo-yu, There is something Grandma would never let me tell you. But I think it's time I told you. How's your headache? Want to rest for a bit? I'm fine. Maybe you have altitude sickness? No way. It's just a cold. I'm wondering if we should head back. The weather's not good. We've gone too far to head back. I'm fine. Just been working more overtime lately. Let's not climb to the peak tomorrow. Wait and see first. I told you I'm fine. What about you? For you. Do you have no shame? Giving me the same gift you gave your ex-wife. It's not the same. How did you know I once gave her glass beads? I saw it on a photo on her blog. You guys were so high-profile. Everyone saw it. So you used to follow her blog. How come you never mentioned it to me before? How could I? You never picked up my calls. It was through her blog that I found out you got married. And had a kid. Do you know how that made me feel? So you got in touch with her? What did you tell her? Lin! What did you tell her? I said... I said... Don't you know your husband is gay? Why? Yo-yu lost his mom because of you. Did you know that? Sorry. Sorry. Li-wei! Li-wei! Calling station. This is station. Did Li-wei Wang come back down? No one has come back down today. Copy. Thanks. Li-wei! Li-wei! Li-wei! Li-wei, are you OK? Li-wei! Calling station. Someone has severe altitude sickness. Please send help! Li-wei! Li-wei! Hold on! Don't fall asleep. Talk to me! Li-wei, don't fall asleep! It's Lin. Li-wei! Can you hear me? Li-wei! Don't fall asleep. Talk to me. Li-wei. It's OK. Feeling better? It's Lin. Yo-yu... What? Look after... I will. I will... I'll look after Yo-yu.. Li-wei! Let's look after Yo-yu together. OK? Let's look after Yo-yu together. Can you hear? Don't fall asleep. (Dad Mark Il) Yo-yu, can you sit over here? Come. Don't be afraid. It's OK. Can you tell me what really happened? I was the one who gave Grandma the pills. Morning -Mr. Lin. There's a letter for you. Thanks. (To Mr. Lin) (from Shanghai City) Yo-yu, be careful. I still don't know how to fly You tell me I have wings If I fly to other places in the future And look down over the world Will I be very happy? This next part I came up with by myself. Can you still fly up in the sky? I know you too have wings If you fly somewhere unfamiliar Will you miss home when it starts raining? Will you be very happy? If I fly to where you'll be Will I also be very happy? In my dreams, you come home with me
