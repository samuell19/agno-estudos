Three, four... NETFLIX PRESENTS No, no. Come on. Quiet, please! Listen, please! It'd be nice to start the year by paying a bit more attention! Thank you. Let's get back into good habits. Stop doodling, please, Mr. Boufarra. Okay, come on. Let's stay focused. He can't help himself. Let's give our dear teachers their schedules, since they can't wait. Since you want to know everything, I'll also tell you who will be head of class for our ninth-grade NEC class, and it is... Mr. Boufarra, their math teacher. Yeah! Bravo! Congratulations! Good luck! Suits me. I have no problem with that. - Great. So I get the NECs again this year. - Stop whining, ladies. "Whining"? You've got them for PE! Damn, they're unbearable. Excuse me. What do you mean by "ninth-grade NEC class"? Oh, yes, I haven't explained. Quiet down, please! We can't hear ourselves speak. Thank you. Last year, those without an elective class were the "eighth-grade NECs." Meaning, those who didn't choose Latin, European studies, or music. So, we took all the dunces and put them together. No! We put all the students with no elective together. Same thing. Last year, we did have some discipline issues. But individually, they're not bad. There's no reason for things to go badly. But we rarely deal with them individually. And one or two disruptive elements do remain. You can't start off the year like this, Mr. Bouchard, - that won't do. - Sorry. Sorry. I just wasn't expecting to have them two years in a row. Well, I'll use this opportunity to introduce our new PEA, Mrs. Samia Zibra. - Hello. - Maybe you could introduce the team? Yes, sure. So, thank you all for welcoming me. I'm going to introduce the monitors. This is Badr, Moussa, Boussad, Dylan, and Leïla. So, if you have any questions or problems at all, come by the Student Life office. That's what we're here for. Thank you. Save yourself, young PEA. Run while you still can! All right, Mohamed. Okay, let's get back to it, please. We're not done yet. So... Mohamed! Your hood! - Your headphones! - Not so loud! Take your headphones off, please. - Hey, no running in the halls! - I'm not, I'm walking fast! Come on, let's go. Now what? Yo, he's crazy. Okay, I get it. Chewing gum in the lock. Okay. Is this how we're going to start the year off, with gum in the lock? Way to go, guys! Why are you looking at me? I didn't do it. - Who said you did? - I don't know. You're looking at me. It was him, sir. I recognize his gum. Shut your mouth, you big ape! Yanis, please! - He's lying! - Issa! Take your hat off for a start. Thank you. Yanis, go get a monitor. Do I look like an errand boy? I've got other stuff to do! Yanis, go get a monitor, please. Go on! - Stupid victim! - Thank you, Yanis. We'll all will hand out the notebooks so we can introduce ourselves. - Shall we start with SPEDs? - Yeah. Oh! The SPEDs! We get to start with the funniest ones! Okay. Maybe it's best if we don't start by ragging on SPED. We can't get in Boufarra's class. There's gum in the lock. Okay, hello, first of all, and it's Mr. Boufarra. Yeah, hello. With Mr. Boufarra... - it's the ninth-grade NEC, right? - Who's that? Oh, that's... it's Frida Kahlo. She was a 20th-Century painter. She's got some eyebrows! She looks like François Fillon! - Follow me. I'll open the door. - But, miss, I remember Frida What's-her-name. Didn't they make a film about her? - Yes. You saw a film on Frida Kahlo? - Yeah. - Wasn't Salma Hayek in it? - Yes, she was. - I remember. I saw it. - Follow me. I'll open the classroom. - Dylan, Moussa, I'll be right back, Okay? - Okay. - Thanks, Mrs. Zibra. - Thanks, miss. You're so kind. Thanks, Frida Kahlo. Stop that right now, none of that with me. Okay, Mrs. Zibra. I get it. You have no sense of humor. Come on. Hurry up. - Thanks, Mrs. Zibra. - My pleasure. ...because you still don't want to work. - Shall we go do SPEDs? - SPEDs, they're the funniest ones! Please, Dylan. - Is it in here? - Yeah. Come in! You have sewing at 10:00. That's enough! We stand when someone... - Moussa, from my building! - I'm not sewing! Moussa, the dude from my place! Stop it! And we stand up when someone enters the room! We have to stand? Come on. Stand up, ninth-grade SPED. Brahim? You have to stand up too. Come on, quickly. You think you're hot stuff, but you're useless! - That's enough! - Hello, everyone. - I'll introduce myself... - Hello, miss. What a stunner! Yeah! That's enough now. That's enough. - Stop! - I'm Mrs. Zibra, your new PEA. I think you already know them, but this is Dylan and Moussa, your monitors. That's right! I do know him! Bingo! - Moussa, the dude from my building. - Calm down. - Hear that? You're from my place. - Calm down. You're in school now. - Pouloulou! - Pouloulou! - Mr. Moussa! - Mr. Moussa! - The guy from my hood! - I'll leave these with you. - Pouloulou! - Pouloulou! - Pouloulou! - Pouloulou! - Mr. Moussa! - Mr. Moussa! - Yeah, yeah, yeah! - Yeah, yeah, yeah! - That's enough! Sit down! - Bye. Thanks, bye. Bye, Moussa! Dylan the fatty! Catch you in the hood, Moussa! - I have to admit, that was funny. - That's for sure. But... it's pouloulou, huh? So, first day back, and you bring nothing? I've got paper and a pen. That'll do for the first day, won't it? That'll do? So you can make notes in history, French, and math on one piece of paper? - This is a good start. - Okay, got it. All right. I'm warning you, I'll give you all another copy of your school supply list. You need to get everything by the end of next week. But we won't have time to buy everything by the end of next week! Let's play a little game. It's the start of the year. Let's set some rules. When I want your opinion, I'll ask for it, okay? I don't want it now. "I don't want it now!" Whoa, Dewey! - What a moron! - He's fucking dead! - We good? - By the way, sir, digging the new haircut! You look like a real dad now! Is that so, Issa? You like it? Maybe cut back on the dad talk. Let me remind you that you're 19 and you've been held back seven times. Your son is next door, in sixth grade. What a bastard! We should figure out who's picking him up, 'cause you're staying until five pm today. Yo, he killed you. He killed you! Hey, sir? Why are you making fun of him? You can't do that. It's not right. - Calm down. That's enough. - "Calm down. That's enough!" Okay, get your stuff and get out. You're done. Well done, new record: seven minutes. Man, fail, kicked out already. - Get back to SPED! - Close the door behind you. Thank you. So, I'm going to give you another copy of your school supply list. I'll give you your schedules, and we will, of course, talk about rules. But before that, I'd like to say something. As you know, last year, this class had quite a lot of problems. Two students were permanently excluded. That's a big deal. So, we're going to start fresh and forget all about that. Just so you know, I'm very happy to be your head of class. Okay? You're in the ninth grade now. This is a very important year for you. At the end of the year, you have to pick a decisive path for your future. So, you can either clown around as you often did last year, or you can decide to work and be serious, in which case we'll have a pleasant year. But to do that, there are some rules you have to follow. "There are some rules you have to follow..." Are you mad? - Wait! - Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! What's going on here? Did you punch him, Jules? Yeah, did you hear what he said to me? I don't want to know what he said! You realize this is the first recess of the year and you're already fighting? Yeah, I'm fighting! If there's a problem, we'll do this again! - We can do it now! - Stop it! Have your parents sign this, and come back on Wednesday, okay? Is it normal I've already given two kids detention on day one? Yes, don't worry. I gave an eighth grader messing around in class two hours already. - Okay. - I took the chance - to start the Simpson Challenge. - What's that? - Nobody's explained the Simpson Challenge? - No. You know the opening credits of The Simpsons? - Yeah? - You know when Bart... - Simpson! - Yeah? When he's writing his lines on the board? - Yeah. - Well, that's... - that's it. - I don't get it. Okay, the goal is to give the stupidest punishment possible. Okay. For example, I gave Nabil Stambouilier 100 lines: "I must not do backward rolls in class." He was really doing backward rolls? Okay, I get it. See, during training, they teach us educational punishments, but in reality, you don't do that. Moussa won last year. - Yeah. - He was so good. He had them write: "I am not an exorcist, and I have no proof that my head of class is possessed by Beelzebub." I was in the lead for ages with "I must not throw up in my classmates' backpacks." Okay. - Goodbye. - Have a good evening. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. No, Fanny, I won't tell you ten times. Your phone stays in your pocket, you leave... you leave, and now, if you want, you can get it out. For you, Saint-Denis must a big change from Roussillon. - Actually, it's Ardèche, not Roussillon. - Okay. No, but I like it here. The weather's different, though. - It's more gray here. - Have you always wanted to be a PEA? Actually, my mom was a teacher. She works for the Board of Education in Grenoble now. So, I always wanted to get into National Education, and then gradually, I wanted to do this. Okay. And Dylan told me it was your choice to come here? - Actually... - Oh, so you chose to... Yeah, yeah, I've always wanted to work in a PEZ. Professionally, I think the PENs here are more interesting, and I needed to move closer to Paris for personal reasons. Your hat, Issa. - Will this do? - Yeah, yeah. - Hey, Dewey, stop... - Get a move on! Slow down. Stop running! Like you've got anywhere to be! - Bye, Yanis. See you tomorrow. - Bye, miss. - Bye, Yanis. - See you, Moussa. Oh, yeah, you've already dealt with Yanis. I really like that kid. Yeah, Yanis is cool. I really like him too. He's... Yeah, he's bright. He needs guidance, though. His home situation's a bit complicated. His dad's been in prison for two years. Oh, right. - I know he visits him sometimes. - What about his mother, know her? His mom's got it together. She keeps him in check. Do you know all your students this well? No, just a few. Yanis is best friends with my little cousin, Fodé. Fodé's a bit older, but they're always together. Hey, are you guys for real? Are you for real? It's true, the weather here is... - More gray? - What? - Here's your brother. - Hey. - All right? First day back go well? - Are you seeing Dad tomorrow? Yeah, I took the afternoon off. Why? I'd like to go visit with you at 2 pm. Don't you have class tomorrow afternoon? Yeah, but come on, I can get out of it just this once. You won't get out of anything. You can go to school and see your father next week. Come on! Please? Please nothing. You're going to school. That's it. Kenza, want to play FIFA instead of watching this crap? No. You only want to play with me so you can beat me. No, I just want to spend time with my beloved little sister. - That's all. - Liar. Yeah. Of course. Come on. I'm going to crush you. Okay, I'll just watch the end first. Fodé! Hey, corn-eater! Hey, you want some chicken? What about you, filthy Arab? Did ISIS call you yet? You asshole. Kenza, my girl, how are you? - Hey, Fodé, you black moron! - "Hey, Fodé, you black moron!" Don't listen to your brother. He talks shit! Go put your veil on. Where's your burka? - You nuts, Fodé? Yelling in the street! - No. Sorry, ma'am. On my mother's life, your kids insulted me first. You know they weren't raised right. Where you headed? Off to eat some corn? I'm going for a ride. See you later, pal. Where's your helmet? - I'll put it on. - I'm serious, put a helmet on! Bye, bunch of kebabs! Okay, you're in the ninth grade. You know this by heart. I'm not going to repeat how important these elections are. The two elected students will represent you all year during any important procedures, including the three class councils. So... Kevin? So, I need a boy and a girl. Which of you young ladies want to put yourself forward? Dewey. Cindy. Amel. Very good. Anyone else? No? And you, guys? Not happening! Go on, Dewey. You run! You're such a retard you'll be great at representing us. Me? No way! Fuck spending my evenings in class councils as well as doing homework! Like you do your homework, SPED! Hey, this SPED thing stops right now, got it? But sir, it's true. SPEDs aren't very smart. Yanis, please! It has nothing to do with being smart. It's just that everyone's different. Everyone learns differently. I'm different! Some people aren't suited to the classic school system, so we adapt the system to them, to explore their abilities. That's all. But, sir, once you're in there, it's over, bro. You can't go back to a normal class! You gotta end up being... a plumber or a lumberjack, bro! He's right. I'm done kidding around. All right? Okay, let's vote. Okay? Yes. Everyone write down the name of a girl and the name of a boy on your ballot paper and put it in the box, okay? Yes, Mrs. Zibra! So, Cindy and Issa. - Whoa, Issa. - They love me around here. And another vote for Mbappé and Kim Kardashian! They're writing down footballers! Finally, we have Jul and Amel. Yeah, all right! - Yeah. - So, if we tally the votes... our representatives this year are... Amel and Mbappé. Congratulations, Amel. As far as Mbappé is concerned, I'll be sure to call him to break the good news. However... However, in terms of availability, I think he's a bit busy with the World Cup, so Mbappé... So, we'll go with his runner-up, - who is none other than... - It's Yanis - with three votes. - Good one! This is your fault. You voted for me! Get off! Who voted for me? You guys are such pains! - What if I don't want to, sir? - No choice. Congratulations. You'll represent your classmates at each class council. Shit! You guys are breaking my balls, bro. Three, four... Okay, thank you. Great, well done. Uh... Bintou, can you try on your own, please? - This is your time to shine! - Quiet, everyone else! Please be... - Quiet. - Be quiet, right. Thank you. - Come on. Quiet! Bintou? - Wait! Three, four... Take your recorder and stick it up your ass! Why don't you stick it up your sister's ass? Okay, come on. Listen and all try together. Are you ready? Come on. Pay attention. One, two, three... Viva Algeria! That's enough! Thank you. Okay, so we aren't ready to play together yet, but it's no big deal. I have faith we'll get there. Yes, what I wanted to tell you is if ever there's a song you really like, let me know. Then we can play it. I also have a drum machine. - We can try that. - That's great! We can give it a go. Uh... I think we can work on some great songs this year. It'll be great. In the meantime... Bah, bah, bah, bah! I'll put the notes here on the... on the... - on the... - Toilet? On the board. Right. Here we go. No, no! What is all this? This is lame. The two smart alecks blowing their recorders like maniacs, carry on. It won't change my desire to make music, okay? Come on. Great. A barking dog, that's really funny. It really is. We're all dying... huh? - We're dying... - Laughing. Right. We're dying laughing. I want to be nice, there's no issue, - just don't take me for a... - Moron! What? - A moron! - Oh! Yanis, what are you after? Are you trying to get excluded at the start of the year? Answer me. No. Yanis, you called your professor a moron. - I didn't. - Stop, Yanis. It's him. He's a weirdo. He never finishes his sentences. He said, "Don't take me for..." And so, I answered. I just made a suggestion. He could've told me it was the wrong answer. Okay, Yanis. I get it. You're very smart. You've got witty comebacks. But don't play this game with me. So, now, you have two solutions: either stop acting the fool to get attention... Look at me when I'm talking to you. Or you keep acting the fool, but I won't let it slide. I won't just leave you alone to mess around. I'll constantly be on your back. They really prettied Frida Eyebrows up in the film. In real life, she's a dog. They cast Salma Hayek. - That's another level. - Wait. I'm telling you that you need to change your attitude, and you're talking about Frida Kahlo? Miss, how come when we don't have class, we have to... You just burst in without knocking? Can't you see I'm busy? I told you she'd blow us off. Don't use that tone with me. Go and wait outside. Thank you. So, from now on, when I talk to you, don't change the subject. Got it? - Okay. - And stop smirking! And most importantly, never insult your teachers. If this happens again, you're going straight to the disciplinary board. Okay, miss. You can go. HAUTS DE SEINE COUNTY JAIL Your dad was looking well today. You think? Your name, please? Bensaadi. - Here you go. - Thank you. - All right? - Yeah, fine. - Mommy, I'm really hungry. - Yes, we're going to eat. - Can we have a McDonald's? - No, we'll eat at home. But it's so far away! I'm too hungry. - Do you want McDonald's? - If Kenza wants to. - I'm asking you. - If Kenza wants to, it's fine. Let's go, then. - Shall we go, Kenza? - Yeah. Come on. It's a story about two sisters. One of them has magical powers, but the other doesn't. How come only one does? That's just how it is. Oh, yeah. Go on, carry on. And well, then, she finds herself in a room with her sister. She and her sister are playing with the ice, and she accidentally freezes her sister. Oh, no! And then what does her sister do? - After, there are... - What's up? Some trolls save her. Some trolls? Where did she find them? They're her friends. Carry on, I want to know how it ends. - Their parents... - Slowly. Their parents went away on a boat, and there was a tornado, so they died. Didn't anybody try to save the two sisters' parents? - They were on their own. - Oh, right. - How's it going, Moussa? - All good. - We aren't late. It's 25 after. - I gotta open the gate. I'm late! Shall we watch cartoons tonight? Give me a kiss? I can't come into school with you. Look, there's your friend. Off you go. - All right? - Hey, how are you? Fodé! Hey, maafe-eater! What are you doing here at 8:00 am? Wait, I'm having trouble with my bike. Come on, walk me to class. - Wait! - You can fix your bike later. What are you doing here at 8:00 am? Nah, for real, I've decided to quit all that. I want to get serious. I need to find a decent job. I've got an interview later, at 9:00 am. - I need to find a good job. - You come straight from a party? - Of course I did! - You reek of booze. Are you for real? I swear, I'm still a bit drunk. I'm telling you, dude, this club in Paris, there were babes, booze, a DJ... Man, you're supposed to be saving up and you're out wasting cash in clubs! - What, you jealous? - A bit! - You can give this back to Kenza later. - Fuck you! Get to school. Hey, Yanis. Yesterday was crazy! - See ya, Fodé. - Don't start lying at 8:00 am! - Come on, we'll be late. - Yesterday was mad. - What happened? - I get home and what do I see? Cristiano Ronaldo in my living room with my father, eating biscuits! They had a glass of milk, but Ronaldo, he won't drink out of glasses! That asshole won't drink out of baby bottles. - What's up, Lamine? - How's it hanging? It's like this every day, man. I think he's practicing his lies. He's a real pro. Come on, he's yelling. We're gonna be late! - You been hiding stuff from me, bro? - I signed for Chelsea. Stop, dude, you're killing me. Go on, run. - Morning. - Morning. So, Leïla, what's the score? - Two each. - What do you mean two each? I'm winning two to one. You laughed your head off at the Pikachu joke. There you go! Oh, here's a good one. Match point, it all rests on this one. - I'm late! - Excuse me. Yes, I know. You have your backpack, but are you opening your parachute before or after math class? That was an easy one. Wait, little warrior. Why did you bring your dishwasher to school? Not bad. Hey, Donatello, doesn't your brother Michelangelo come to school anymore? - Not bad. - Can I go? I'm gonna be late. Go on, Franklin, run! But take off your shell before going into class. Bye, Eminem! - Did you make a joke about turtles? - So? You stole my theme. Red card! It wasn't about the same cartoon. - Same animal. Red card! - Whatever! Is Donatello a turtle or not? - So, what? - Excuse me, miss? Yes, you're late. Shit, they broke my mirror again. Yes, but I still have to give you a late slip. What class are you in? No, wasn't that funny, Samia? Why is it funny? Because since you're the school PEA, a PEA doesn't have a class. - I'll be in my office. - 'Cause she has an office. Uh, Leïla? Leïla? Thank God you're going. We've had enough. We couldn't get a word in edgewise! "Blah, blah, blah..." All you do is talk! Three to two. You laughed. Three to two, I win. You're so sneaky! Oh. Thank you, my Lord. - Sorry, I didn't hear my alarm. - Yeah, I get it. You live in Chinatown, it's far. - Three all. - No, that doesn't count! - How come? - It doesn't count! You laughed, so it's three all. I wanted to ask if he was the one who made my shoes, but... Four to three. Who gave you this punishment? Look behind you: big fat Dylan. What's wrong with you? - You can't talk like that! - Look at him, and tell me he isn't fat. Are you nuts? You don't talk like that. Stop it right now. Yeah, all right. Sorry. "I was not taken hostage by some weirdos in the street." Hmm. A bit of an overblown excuse for being late, isn't it? Fine, don't believe me. You never do. Why am I here, anyway? Were you really taken hostage by some weirdos in the street? Yes. I went down an alley, and five guys jumped me. They put a hood over my head, took me God knows where. I spent the whole night thinking about my mom, praying to God, but thank God, I got away. I'm alive, miss! Right, that's... - See, you don't believe me! - I just want to... Come with me. I want to show you something. - Morning, miss. - Morning. - Can you take care of them, Dylan? - Yes. I brought him here because he was showing his butt in class. "Showing his butt..." On September 22nd, you were late because of the strike. Yeah, there was a strike. Farid, it was an AirFrance strike, and you live down the street. I was at my aunt's down south. She's really ill. - What's wrong with her? - She has a brain tumor. Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know. It's okay. I won't hold it against you. That's life, you know? Yes, I know. Thank you, Farid. On September 29th, you were late because an animal wouldn't let you cross the road. Oh, yeah. I saw a huge dog. It looked like an antelope. On my mom's life, my life flashed before my eyes. - An antelope? - I swear, - it was nuts. I panicked! - Really? I'd have preferred to be taken hostage again. - It didn't bite you, though? - No, it bit one of my friends, - but I saved his life. - You see? You're a hero, Farid. - I know. - Next. On October third, you hadn't slept all night because of a ghost that was going, "Oohlooloo." No, I admit I went a bit too far with that one. But for the rest, on my mom's life, I was telling the truth, the whole truth. Oh, right, so the men who took you hostage in the street and the antelope that stopped you crossing the road, that was true? Yes, and I fought it. No, but, Farid... please, stop. We aren't stupid. Nobody in this school believes me, anyway! At this rate, Farid Amoudi's gonna get depressed. But, Farid, come on. The problem is that you're a liar. I'm not a liar. Yes, you are a liar. So, what are we going to do with you? Huh? Well, in that case, I'll stop lying when I'm late. No! You won't be late anymore, that's it! Classes started a month and a half ago, so, from tomorrow, I'll see you outside my office every date at 8:25 before class, okay? Uh... Okay, but I'm making no promises. No! You'll manage it. I'll see you tomorrow - outside my office at 8:25. - Look, - he makes fun of me every day, miss. - Go on. - You're fat, I swear. - Stop it! Get out. Get to class. He's my favorite student. - He's a genius. - Yes. An antelope, he said. An antelope, that's impossible. And why is it impossible? Because there are no antelopes in urban areas. Especially in Saint-Denis, you can't... I have some great days in your company. - You put the kicked-out kids in detention? - Yeah, nine already. The teachers take it too far. They kick kids out for any little thing, right? It's always like that here. What about you, Samia, were there antelopes in Périgord? Oh, damn. No, that's not funny. Why isn't it funny? Because, you see, I'm from Ardèche, not Périgord. So, when making jokes based on geography, it helps to know where someone is from so that we get the punchline. - What's up, miss? - That's true. - Wait, are you meant to start at 8:30? - Really? "Really?" Come with me. I'll give you a late slip. Don't worry. I'll sort it, Samia. Okay, thanks. No big deal. All right, Kévin. You can come back in. - Evening! - Kévin... I don't want to hear another word. Sit down. Issa, to the board. Yeah, straight to Issa! Shocker! It's always the same. It's because he's black, isn't it? You're putting him to work first. Yanis, please. I don't want to hear these kinds of observations. Recess is over. - Now isn't the time to mess around, okay? - What's that? This one is hard! It's really tough. Look, he's taller than the board! Bintou! But, sir, math is hard enough as it is with all the numbers, now you add letters? - Is this French or math? - It's math. Just focus, you can do it. - I know it, sir. Can I do it? - Okay, Amel. Tell us the answer. - You put the X on the other side... - Shh. - Listen, guys. - Kévin! ...We're listening, Amel. - Take the X to the other side, then you have six divided by three, which is two. Almost there. Carry on that way, Amel. It's good. Amel tried. She had a go. That's great. It's good, Amel. You take part. You work hard. It's good. You suck, though. Shut your mouth! Oh! - Are you seriously gonna do nothing? - Amel! Yanis! - I swear, you piece of shit. - Shut up! - What's up with you? - Nothing, I'm just joking. You're joking? You want to talk? Tell us the answer, then. I don't have an answer, sir. I just want to ask you, since you're our head of class, what's the point of replacing numbers with letters? Just a couple of examples of how it's actually used in life, unless I become a teacher, why would I need to solve this equation? Okay. So, I'm going to explain to you what math is used for. Math helps you to be logical and rigorous. It helps you not get ripped off. It also helps you realize that there are no problems that don't have solutions, even the toughest. Everything in life can be solved. It's needed for your High School Cert. - Your bac, if all goes well. - Sir, you said it wasn't the time for jokes, why are you talking about the bac now? You know what I meant. Math gets your brain to fix a problem, like Issa's doing right now on the board. It gets your brain to fix a problem and never let it go. Once you've really, really struggled and succeeded, you're proud of yourself. Self-confidence is very important. Basically, equations and math, and all sorts of other subjects, are key to all the skills we're trying to give you, and it's for you, not us. I'm a math teacher. My future is sorted. It's so you can choose your future. That's the most important thing. But why give us things to do just to make us struggle instead of doing useful things? Like, we could, I don't know, build IKEA furniture! - Right, build IKEA furniture! - Okay! I'm going to explain something. There are few jobs out there building IKEA furniture! Whereas equations are the basis for loads of really good jobs. Banker, accountant, architect... Explorer! Explorer, astronaut. Do you seriously see any bankers or accountants here? Does Issa look like an architect to you? Does that retard look like he could be an astronaut? - Never, sir. - Shut your mouth! - I've done it. - Tell us what you've done. - It makes 18. - That's it. Great, Issa. Well done. I'm the teacher. I'll teach the class! All right, you can sit down. I hope you've understood. Maybe Issa does look like an architect. - Nobody told them. - You too, actually, Yanis. Sometimes your observations are very astute. You think carefully. And what's that down to? School. No, I don't think so. It's thanks to the street. He's right, sir. Street certified! Street certified? What about your haircut, who certified that? You're on fire, Mr. Boufarra! You really said that? IKEA furniture? Damn, dude, you're crazy! Honestly, Boufarra's a nice guy. He's not like the other teachers. You can tell he wants to help us. Who gives a damn if teachers are nice or nasty? Don't pay attention to them. Focus on yourself. Work. "Work." You're a funny guy! You see what they make us do? Nothing to keep us interested. It's up to you, bro. I'm trying, I swear. - I can't do it. - You always say that. Focus on yourself, work hard, and stop messing around. You're a smart dude. You could crush anything in school. - I'm always telling you. - I love it when you play big brother. You're a great example, with all you're doing. Shut up! How's business going, anyway? All's good, brother. I did a big favor for the Agoudil brothers and now they're really looking after me. They're supplying me in bulk. I have huge quantities to sell. I'm raking it in. It's chill, bro. Be careful. You're getting into the big leagues. It's cool. Let me just sort an order out. Kaïs! Over here. Come here, pal. - What's up? - How are things, little man? - Cool. - You okay? What's up, kids? All right, pal? Go to the bakery, get me two Tropicos and a Kinder Bueno, okay? Sure. Here. If you're quick, you can keep the change. Share it with your friends. Go on, go fast. Okay. You're the head of class. If you let this slide, it's over. - He'll think he can do anything. - No. Yanis isn't a bad kid, he was just teasing. Not a bad kid? Ever since his pal was excluded, he's been convinced it was my fault. He's driving me mad. He has no respect. No boundaries. If I may, I think this is just an issue with respect. Yes, he's often confrontational, but it's a confrontation of ideas. No, I get it. He's a pain, but he's engaging in dialogue. You only see him for a few seconds. We have him for four hours a week. We're supposed to be teaching them. Actually, I see the problematic students plenty, given you all kick them out whenever you can. Thierry, we all handle the kids. This isn't a competition. I don't know what Yanis did. I don't know all the details, but let's be honest. He's hardly the most disrespectful kid in the school. It's true. He's not the worst. Hang on, when a kid openly makes fun of you to make the whole class laugh, when he says your methods are Nazi-like, that physically, you look like the son of Trump crossed with Van Gogh, I'm sorry, but that's disrespectful. Thierry, sorry, Nazi-like methods, I don't know, but on my mother's life, you have the same head as Van Gogh. I completely agree. It might be my fault, we were working on the impressionists. Maybe he wanted to make a reference. You have Van Gogh's head, you know it. - No, but... - No, face, Van Gogh's face. - Van Gogh's face. - Let it slide, he's a math teacher. He's not a French teacher, this immigrant. You're a PE teacher and you weigh over 100 KG. - I've room to grow. - Good one. One all. - I'm... - No, Thierry, wait. I'm going to see the principal. If she does nothing, I quit. I can't take anymore. - No, come on, Thierry. - Sit down. - We can discuss Yanis calmly. - I am calm. I'm just fed up. You don't get it. It pisses me off. You think you're doing them a favor by not setting any boundaries? You may think this is a humanist way of teaching, but... - Thierry, we do set boundaries. - Bye. Thierry, please... On my mother's life, he looks just like Van Gogh. They're identical. That's it! Great! That's it! Bunch of assholes. What the fuck are you doing? You're driving me mad. Come on! Yes, great! Great! That's it. For fuck's sake, no tackling! Son of a bitch! No tackling! Go on, get up! It's nothing. He's faking! Neymar, get up! On my mother's life, you're pissing me off, and you're ugly! - Wow! - I hurt myself. Unlucky, it rebounded. That's it. Go and warm up. You're going in. Harouna, F your granny! - Sir, stop swearing. - I'm not swearing. It's just sports banter. I'm preparing you for the big leagues. You go in and block those little fuckers. Yes, block them. And listen to instructions! Yes, get him! Fuck your mother! Fuck all your mothers! Move your asses, get in front, and try to do as much... Fuck, Dewey! He's fucked himself up. Are you a fucking moron, Dewey? He's out of bounds. Nobody touch him! It's fine. - It's fine?! - It's no big deal. He's alive. - Tell her he's fine, fireman. - He does have a broken nose. Sir, when I breathe through my nose, it whistles. It's really weird. I can even play a tune! Oh, it hurts too. Okay, well, thank you, guys. Good luck. Stop limping, it's your nose that's broken! - Little moron. - Dewey... Kévin? Your parents will meet you at the emergency room, Okay? It's fine. That's sports. There are injuries in all sports. This isn't sport, Rédouane. This is a circus! No, not a circus. You work in a school. You aren't here to try out random experiments! You're supposed to ensure the students' safety. Why can't you just play normal sports from time to time? What, you want me to teach ping pong like all the other schools? Ping pong is great. That would suit me. Are you for real? You want me to teach ping pong? It's a shit activity. We'll be fucking bored! Stop swearing, Rédouane! It's not acceptable. This is a school, for fuc... It's fine. I get it. We'll play ping pong. We'll buy some ping pong tables, some ping pong balls, ping pong paddles, and then we'll play. Tick, tick, tick. Ping pong. The sport of dumbasses. Fuck ping pong's mother! Here, give this to your teacher. - He won't let me in. - He will. - He won't. - Idrissa, get a move on. - He will let you in. - He won't! Idrissa, go! - He won't want to. I'm too late. - Go to class. - But, miss, you can't do that. - Hurry up. Go. Okay, Yanis, Mr. Bouchard has complained about your behavior. This isn't the first time. What's your deal with him? Mrs. Zibra, just between us, this won't leave the room. Can't you see that Bouchard is nuts? He's not normal. First of all, it's Mr. Bouchard, and "this won't leave the room"? Who do you think you are? You're a student, you're 15, stop talking to adults and teachers as though they're your friends. You want to get excluded, is that it? If you like, I'll call your mom and tell her why you're excluded. No, there's no point, miss. It's fine. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have spoken to you like that. I'll even apologize to Mr. Bouchard. I want you to change your attitude. I'm trying, I swear, but Mr. Bouchard hates me. I can tell. - And I have no interest in his class. - Mr. Bouchard... Mr. Barbosa isn't here. Can we go home? I don't know. Wait outside. Just tell us, miss, it'll take two seconds. Mr. Barbosa is in today. Wait outside. Get back to class. Thank you. Okay, so, teachers aren't here to like or hate their students. And okay, maybe you aren't interested in history, but you aren't interested in math, Spanish, or earth sciences either. You're only doing okay in French, but you can't only study the subjects you like. So, what do we do? Actually, miss, the thing is, I don't really get what we're doing here. How will this stuff help us in life? Believe you me, there are 1,000 uses for everything we teach you. But to understand them, you have to be curious. What are you interested in, Yanis? I don't really know. Other than playing FIFA, watching films and TV shows, not much. - You watch a lot of TV? - Yeah. Because of my dad. Ever since I was little, he showed me lots of films. He'd take me to the cinema. And... is it your dad you go and visit in prison? Yeah. - But I don't want anyone to know. - Of course, don't worry. Besides, I was going to say the same to you. Nobody knows about me either. Who do you go and visit? A friend. - Can I trust you? - Yeah. It's our little secret. Has your dad been in prison for long? Well, it's been almost two years now. He has another year to go. And visits aren't too hard? No, we're used to it. It's not his first time inside. You? I'm not used to it. It's the first time he's been arrested, and... - and it's definitely the last. - They all say that. "It's the first time. I won't do it again." And you believed him? Okay, so what's your favorite type of film? I like everything really, especially old Mafia films. Things like Goodfellas or Scarface. - I even watch French films. - Really, even French films? - Yeah. - See, that's a good start. You know, if that interests you, there are all kinds of jobs in cinema. Oh, really? I don't know. You should ask your guidance counselor. That's what they're there for. I don't know. You have to get a move on. You're on the wrong path and it's a shame. I know you're worth more than that. What if I'm not worth more? Kévin, please! Focus! Brilliant, Issa! Come on, jump! Everyone! That's it! Move it! We've already punished her. She'll do her detention. But we need her to understand. Thank you for coming. Thank you. You were very nice to me. Are you Algerian? Uh... Algerian descent, yes. It's nice to see Algerians in good jobs like this. May God bless you and your parents. I don't speak Arabic. My mother is Caribbean and my father's Algerian. They didn't speak Arabic to me when I was little. - Shame. Bye. - Bye. - Have a good day. - Thanks. You too. I didn't know you were of... - Yes, Badr. - Right. - Yes? - Hello. I'm looking for my home liaison diary. Leïla, can you hand me one, please? Thanks. - You're listening to Shurik'n? - Yes. You know him? My older brother gets me to listen to loads of old rap: Shurik'n, IAM, NTM, but this one... this one has an awesome sound. Yeah, I love this song. I thought you'd be more into Jul, PNL... I listen to them too, but I can like both. That's true. - Bye. - Bye. What did she say? She said, "I'll go out with you if you lose ten kilos." They're tough at that age, bro. Who's invited to Mohamed's party, by the way? - The whole student life office, I think. - Really? - Are you going, Dylan? - I'm going. - Last year's was great. - I'm going too. Can we bring someone? Come with whoever you like. Even the principal is bringing someone. She's bringing her man. We're going to meet the famous Patrick. What about you, Samia? Are you going with Boufarra? The math teacher? Why would I go with Boufarra? Why are you laughing? Why are you all laughing? He's laughing 'cause it's really funny. Why is it really funny? Stop implying things like that. I don't find it funny at all. Sorry. What's up, miss? Reda, I'll remind you that five tardies gets you an hour of detention. You're cutting it fine. - Really? - "Really?" Come on. It's all right. Don't worry. I'll handle it. Come on. You're really pushing it. I have to give you a late slip. I can't save your ass every time. Okay. Can you bring me 50 euros worth tomorrow? Wait, wait, wait. - Morning, sir. - Morning. Not for tomorrow, no. I've only got hash. No weed until next week. - Put me down for 50 euros for Monday. - Okay, but don't put me down as late. Are you mad? You got here late in front of Zibra. I have to give you a late slip or my ass is grass. Come on. But you can't take overtime. Evening! - Evening. - Evening. - This is Patrick. - Nice to meet you. Mohamed teaches biology, - Delphine, fine arts. - Evening. - And Rédouane is PE. - Oh, so you're Rédouane? - What do you mean, "So you're Rédouane"? - She told me about roller football. - I'm a big fan. - Thank you. That kind of thing speaks to me. I'm a basketball coach. So that kind of activity really spoke to me. - She wants me to teach ping pong! - Rédouane, stop. Nobody finds it funny. Come on, I'll introduce you. I'll talk to her, don't worry. Check it out. That's my work! Look! Did you see that? I win! Drop it. - Are you stupid or what? I was there. - You're just pissed. Whoa, it looks like Cindy's already fucked someone! Of course she's fucked someone. What kind of question is that? And you, Farid, you sure you've fucked someone? Of course I have. What do you think? - Sure. - Farid's a vrigin! Right, because you've fucked someone, Dewey, right? Me? Dude, I've fucked loads of times! I've fucked at least twice. Look at this asshole! - Twice. - Twice! Who've you fucked, Farid? Hang on, Dewey, by the way, it doesn't count if you fucked your sister! - It had to be said. - I haven't got a sister. - Go on, Farid. Who'd you fuck? - A girl from Paris. - What's her name? - Céline. - Where was it? - In camp in Saint-Jean-de-Monts, - in Vendée. - He's quick. Honestly, he's fast, quick. Hey, you're good. Now that's Farid the Liar. Go on. Tell us, Farid. How long did you last the first time? - What do you mean? - Don't beat around the bush. Your first time, how long was your cock inside your friend Céline for? I don't know. What, you think I had a timer on my dick? Use your brain! Answer me, mate. I don't know, I said. About 35, 40 minutes! You're a liar! No, I swear, it's true. Farid the Liar! You're such an asshole! - God willing, you die this weekend! - My man, if you'd fucked, you'd know that the first time you go for two jerks and then squirt and you're done. It doesn't even last a minute! - Right, boys? - How's it hanging? What's up? - What's up, bro? - You said you weren't coming¬! Your little brother's already smoking, and you do nothing! What are you doing? Give me that! What did I say? Stop smoking, little fag. Oh, you drink wine? So, you drink alcohol? Yeah, I checked Wikipedia and it turns out that wine is, in fact, alcohol. Aren't you a science teacher? Why, is it a problem if I drink alcohol? Not at all. I'm not judging. To each their own. It's just that to me, not drinking is better, isn't it? Oh, I get it. It's because I'm an Arab you're surprised I drink alcohol. No, not at all. Wait, Messaoud, you're lecturing me about alcohol while rolling a big, fat joint? It's not the same. You know that in Islam, any product that affects judgment and reasoning is prohibited? - You know your stuff, huh? - Better than you, it seems. You don't know what to say! I'm going to get another glass of wine, like a infidel! Savage! Burn! She got you good. She really shut you up. - All right, stop. - Oh, he's hurt. And the way she left, turning her back on you.

Kévin, cell phone, please. Get to class. The bell's rung. There you are. Mind telling me where you were this morning? - At my trial. - Oh, yes, your trial. How did it go? Yeah. I didn't get anything. I told you I didn't do anything. As usual, you've never done anything. - No running in the halls! - I'm not running. I'm walking fast! All well, Lamine? Oh, actually... I spoke to your music teacher yesterday. He said you like music. You put the effort in. - You have lots of ideas. - Yeah, I like it. Why didn't you choose music? I thought it would all be singing in a choir or playing recorder. No, they do contemporary music too. If you want, I can ask your teacher if you can go to some of the classes. - Composition workshops, for example? - What's that? For writing instrumentals. Since you enjoy it. Oh, really? Sure, okay. Why not? I'll ask and let you know, okay? - Thanks, miss! - Have a good day. - How's it hanging? - Not bad. Tell your brother I said "Salaam." Look, it's when I threw the sponge at the board. You already showed us. Stop breaking our balls. What's that? - Oh, look. - Drag. - That's rubbish. - You already showed us, and we told you it was crap. - You couldn't do it. - It's crap, bro. Lamine, we were talking about you earlier. You did great. Sure did! I set the bar high. You guys are there, playing with your scraps of paper, your erasers, and I'm in the future. - Nobody's ever done what I did. - You're in the future? You think what you did was a big deal? You just threw an ink cartridge. You didn't even film it, mate! It doesn't count. You're just jealous, jerk. - What are you talking about? - He's right. We said the aim of the challenge was to film it and put it on Snapchat. The armistice is declared and resonates throughout Europe. - Resonates throughout Europe. - "Resonates..." - In your head, Enzo. - "In your head, Enzo." Enzo! Resonates throughout Europe. Which brings us to part two: "The Consequences of the First World War." - Are we writing a book or what? - I don't need the commentary. But my hand's hurting! No need to talk to write a title. - Can't we have a little break? - She's right. Okay, I got it. Thank you. Put down your pens. - I'll go to the board. - Great idea, sir. I'll draw a historical timeline. We'll annotate it together. Yay. Kévin, next time, you're out. Okay, we'll do a historical timeline on the consequences of the World War I. When we talk about consequences, what do you think... Oh, the bastards! Hey, who snapped? There's not much to go on to accuse Yanis. I know it was him! Just before I went to the board he said, "Great idea, sir." The problem, Mr. Bouchard, is that even if we have our suspicions, we can't accuse him without proof. - What's their next class? - I've got them after recess. What we can do is all four of us go to the classroom and tell them whoever did it has until the end of the day to own up, or the whole class gets a warning. - A warning? - Or we'll suspend them all for three days. Better to suspend them. - A warning will make them... - But you really think Yanis is going to own up, feel bad for his friends? He doesn't give a damn! He just humiliated his teacher without a second thought! He'll let everyone get suspended for three days without a care. Yeah, it's no big deal. What do we do if it is him and he doesn't own up? I think we should try to threaten the whole class. I agree. You're naive. I told you, the next time you're kicked out, I'll hit you. I'll beat you even harder than your mom. - Go for it. I did everyone a favor. - You're laughing? The whole class was happy to be suspended for three days. Imagine if I'd said it was me. What would they have done? - True. - They'd have expelled me. But come on, throwing a carton of milk at the board, are you for real? - It was funny, though. - It was funny. You're mad, bro. Calm down. He's the one who excluded Djibril last year. He knew we were friends. It's obvious Bouchard doesn't like me. - What you up to? - Just going for a walk. I can't stand that guy. Ever since he started selling dope in school, he's been full of himself. - Who? - Him, there. Reda. - He sells dope in school? - Yeah. And he's a snitch. His whole family are snitches. His uncle ratted out my dad. - His uncle ratted out your dad? - So they say. Those sons of bitches! No, that's a dead end too. I've been turned away by every official resource. Fuck, I can't catch a break, man. Then again, there are no jobs in France these days, so promising to hire a bloke in the clink... - Did you dare ask your boss? - No. Listen, what I can do is ask one of my teacher colleagues, but that's awkward for me. I don't like it. I know. I'm sorry. I know you don't like it. Explain my situation to them. I got tricked like a dumbass, but I shouldn't be here. I'm anything but a thug. You know that? Yes, I'll explain all of that. And besides, he's cool. He's always lived around here. He might have some ideas. Oh, he's cool? What do you mean? What's his name? Messaoud. He's a math teacher. You jealous or something? Oh, Okay. Messaoud. Don't worry about it. I'd rather you didn't talk to him. I'll stay here. It's not so bad. At least the food's good. Yeah, you're right. You're fine there. You can read. It won't do you any harm. Shit. Yes, just a second, please. I have to go. - Okay. Take care. Bye. - You too, babe. Bye. Yes. Come in. - Hello. - Hello, Mr. Bejaoui. Take a seat. - Hello, Nordine. - Hello. We asked you to come in because Nordine's been slacking off a bit recently, with his attitude. Certain teachers are complaining about him. He talks back. He's insolent. He gets up in his math teacher's class, Mr. Boufarra, to dance. - On several occasions... - Sorry? - He dances in class? - Yes. You dance in class, Nordine? I hope you're joking? Answer me. Get up and dance, then. Show me how you dance. I want to see. - What do you mean? - I want to see how you dance. No, Mr. Bejouai, I don't think there's any need. Yes, there's a need. Show me. Get up and dance. I can't dance in front of my PEA. - Sir, no. - Dance for your PEA and your dad just like you did in class. Get up and dance. I won't let this go. - But, Dad... - Don't give me, "Dad." You should've thought about dad before. Get up and dance. - No, but it's... - Go on. But... Well, dance! You want me to make music? Dance! There you go. You've got rhythm, huh? Good. You're very talented. So, instead of learning math, you dance? And you embarrass us by dancing like that? Sit back down. No, but, Mr. Bejaoui... It's sorted. I guarantee he won't dance in class again. Same for the rest. Stop dicking around. First I'm going to take away all your PlayStation games and stuff. I'll be back here in a month. I want to see all of his teachers. - Okay. - If your attitude still hasn't improved, this summer you can stay in Saint-Denis. No vacation. That way, you'll have plenty of time to dance. That'll do, Mr. Bejaoui. I think Nordine is a smart boy... Smart? He mixes up dance and math class! Is that smart? - He's got the point. He'll be good. - I hope so. Thank you for coming in, Mr. Bejaoui. We'll check in next month, okay? With pleasure. Sooner, if he messes around again. - Very well. - Don't hesitate to call me. Have a good day. Bye, Nordine. You can't even dance. Walk! Embarrassing us like that! Keepers in the goals! Good! You're still here? Uh, yeah, just finishing up a report. I'm not done yet. I'll wait for you. No. I've got another ten minutes. I'm just going for a coffee across the street. Want to join me? Uh... Sure, why not? I'll be there soon. I'll just finish this. See you soon. See you. See, a PEA doesn't only exist to hand out papers or give detention. You want to monitor and help a lot of kids. You feel like this is the time you can't let up on them. That said, you should be careful. You have to find a balance... You can't finish at this time every day, or you'll burn out. Why? You think there's inevitably a moment where... you give up? No, it's fine. You seem strong. You'll make it. What about you? Do you feel like you've given up? No, I've been here for eight years now. I still believe because, well, I love... I love this job. I love teaching in Saint-Denis. And I guess, after all these years, I've realized we have limits. Meaning? Teaching in Saint-Denis isn't like teaching elsewhere. Inevitably, at some point, you'll have cases that get away from you. Something you didn't understood, a detail you missed. Context is sometimes much stronger than we are. I didn't think it would be this hard, actually. And if we take the weather into account as well, for you... - You've really got it rough. - Exactly. But when you get two minutes to really talk to them, it's... There are some great times. Look at little Orélie in sixth grade class E. She's incredible. Or Issa, Maïmouna, Yanis. Yanis. It's cute when you talk about him. He has a particular story. His dad, you mean? Actually, I know about it because... because I saw him at the jail in Nanterre. The thing is, what I wanted to tell you is... It's so embarrassing to have to ask you, but... my partner is in prison. Your partner? Your boyfriend, you mean? Yes, my boyfriend. He was arrested in Paris for credit card fraud, and it's not like him at all to do something like that. He's got an opportunity for conditional release, but he has to have a job offer to get it. And... I've been looking for weeks and I can't find anything, and I don't know anyone here, so... You've kind of caught me off-guard here, but I'm thinking of my brother. His friend has a delivery driver company. I can try to find out if he has anything. Of course, no problem. - Merci, Messaoud. - No problem. - I was embarrassed to ask you. - No. But you're the only person who... Honestly, you were right to ask me. We'll give it a go. - Stop running! - Okay, Moussa. Yanis! Yanis! Come here, please. - I wanted to talk to you about something. - What? - About Fodé. - What about him? I know what he's up to these days. He's getting more full of himself. His mom came to see me. She's panicking. I tried talking to him, but you know, I'm his older cousin. He thinks I'm lecturing him. You're his friend. He trusts you. Have a word with him. Moussa, I'm 15 and he's 20. What do you want me to tell him? You really think he'll stop dealing if I ask him to? Don't worry, though. Your cousin isn't an idiot. I know plenty of non-idiots who ended up inside. Don't let yourself get dragged in. You'd better not be up to anything shady with him! You know I'm not into that stuff. It's not for me. I know what 6:00 am raids are like and prisons in Nanterre. If I did anything like that, my mother would kill herself... or me. Even Fodé doesn't want me near it. He'd kill me first. - I hope so. - Moussa, the dude from my building! Mamadi! Come here. This Moussa-the-dude-from-my-building business is over. Last time, I didn't say anything. Next time, I'll kick your ass, got it? - Hmm. - Hmm, what? You kidding? You think I'm joking? - Come on, Moussa. - Moussa, what? - Neighbor. - Neighbor, what? I don't give a rat's ass! Why are you laughing? You idiot! In a bad mood today, huh? I'll leave you to it. Well, I asked you to come in because I wanted, as I wrote in your daughter's liaison diary, I wanted to see you to speak to you about... the clothes Cindy wears to school. I told her to be careful with what she wears. This is a school, got it? - Careful. - To be clear, the kids can dress how they wish to come to school. Mm-hmm. But sometimes, the problem is... Cindy's outfits are... a bit borderline. Okay. And that in particular, you can't do PE in a skirt and heels. I'm always telling her that! Right, Cindy? Yes, true. And at school, the boys... you know how they are. It's more because we're in a school setting, and especially for PE, madam. But, miss, I don't like sneakers or gym shoes. They're ugly! Cindy, you stop that right now! - Miss! Hey, Cindy. What's up? - What's up, Fatou? - Hey, Fatou! - Fatou, you see I'm busy. Please leave. Okay. Okay, Cindy, there are rules here in school. For math class, you bring your textbook, your calculator. For PE, you wear appropriate clothing. Clear? Got it? Hmm? - This is a school setting. - Yeah, I got it. Thank you for coming. - Thank you. - Bye. I have faith in you, Cindy. Yes, miss. I loved that meeting! When you have to explain to a student for 15 minutes that she can't come to school dressed as a prostitute, and her mother, who is in the room, is herself dressed like a whore. What's wrong with you? - Come on, Samia, you saw... - Don't talk like that. I'll explain the concept. You're supposed to be representing adults here. So, I'll ask you to respect women, the students, the students' parents. Do I make myself clear? - Hello. - Hello, Lamine. Could you come to the music room? We want to show you something. - "Show you something." - I'm serious. Dylan, you can come too, if you like. Okay, Lamine, this was your idea, you're the conductor. Go for it. Okay. - Everyone ready? - Yeah. One, two, three... Viva Algeria! LIBERTY, EQUALITY, FRATERNITY So, what's this training about, miss? I'm not a specialist, but I know you learn how to shoot, how to edit. - You know what editing is? - Yeah, I know. There should be classes about how to produce a film, etc. Yes? - I've come to get my ball back. - It's the tennis ball. Oh, yes, the tennis ball. I don't want to see you playing with it in the halls. - Okay. - Next time, I'll keep it. Okay? - Bye. - Bye. - Mrs. Zibra? - Yes? We have to have a meeting to talk about Nordine. This can't go on. Okay. I'm just in a meeting, but we can talk later? - Great. Thanks. - What's up, miss? You well? - Fine. Thanks. - You're so beautiful, you know. - It's true. It's not fair. - That's enough, Yanis. - You're so pretty. - All right! Thanks. - I'll wait outside. - Okay. What was that? Nothing, just a little bet with friends. We'll keep telling her until the end of the year. - Okay. - So, this VTC, is it after the bac? Yes, after the bac. That's rough, miss! No, but... Yanis, you're frustrating. I don't understand you students. You're so confident about so many things: if we listen to you, you've seen it all, know it all. I mention the bac and you panic? Have you seen my grades? Precisely, Yanis. I'm talking about a training program that could be made for you. Everyone knows if you were motivated, your grades could change overnight. Thank you for looking for me, anyway. It was very kind. I'll think about it. No, you won't think about it. You'll knuckle down. You have an appointment with your guidance counselor to find out more. That's a drag, miss! But... what else, Yanis? I'll have to thank you the day I get my Oscar. You better. Go on, off you go. Bye. Miss, I don't know if I've told you, - but you're so pretty! - That's enough, Yanis! Stop! Come on, tell us! What's going on in here? I won! What, the Simpson Challenge? Yes, ma'am. You won't see any better this year. You haven't won anything. I'm sure I've got better. Oh, you're here? And you talk? Sometimes, when you shut your mouth. Ooh! Well played. - Burn! - Look. Come and see. - I've won anyway. Show us. - Look. I made him write 100 times, "I must not eat Honey Loops in music class." So, the kid was there in class, with his box of Honey Loops, - a bowl, and a spoon, eating. - No way! Not bad. Listen to this masterpiece. Hello, miss. I've brought Karl, there's been a problem. First of all, I was sitting quietly in class, listening as I always do, when this other guy, I don't know his name, came over and stole my eraser. Logically, since he stole from me, I took his 4-color pen. And what does the teacher do? He looks at me and says, "You're always messing around!" I told him I didn't do anything. He stole my eraser. And he just goes, "Whatever, you never do anything, never mess around. You're a model pupil." I said it wasn't normal for him to shout at me when, in this story, I was the victim. Then I tell him... I... Go on, anyway... Oh... It pisses me off. All this over an eraser. I didn't do anything. He shouted at me. Then he kicked me out. That's not normal. I'm fed up with it. - Why are you looking at me like that? - Are you done? Yes. - You sure? - Yes. - Then get out. We're having a meeting. - We'll sort this out later, okay? Okay. Holy shit. So, anyway, listen to this... I had them write 100 times, "Farting in front of a Bunsen Burner in chemistry class does not count as an experiment." - That's a good one. - Farting? Why did he steal that kid's eraser, anyway? Honestly, that's... Oh, my God. All right, Badr? How can you rival Ronaldo? Look at all his goals in the last ten years. It's more than just goals. What about number of titles? Exactly, Ronaldo has way more titles than Messi. Whatever! No point talking about it. Unless they win the World Cup, they'll never beat Zidane. Did I tell you Zidane was my uncle? - Shut up! - Shut your mouth, you prat. Stop telling your life stories using players from the '90s. Hey, you! I saw that! Put that back right now! - Right now! - I didn't take anything. - Mrs. Zibra, come here, please. - What's going on? He stole a load of desserts. - Look in his bag. - Is that true, Lamine? All right. Come to my office. I knew he'd get caught one day. Hey, don't do that! - You snitch. - Dirty rat. Miss, can I have a word? Sure. What's up? It's about Lamine. I know he's been suspended for three days. That's too harsh. No. Listen, Amel, I know you like getting involved in things that don't concern you, but I don't need your opinion here. You think he was stealing for fun? You know his story? No, I can't know the story of every student here. Okay. I just wanted to tell you his dad died a long time ago, his mother is on her own with five kids, and so... they don't always have enough food at home. I also know that Yanis and his mom, they help when they can, but it's not always easy. And so, he steals, but it's not just for fun. It's because things are really tough at home. They have nothing. That's it. I just wanted to let you know that. Okay. - Bye. - Bye. - What's wrong? - It's over. I saw my lawyer, they're pinning another case on me. I'm going back to court. I could get up to six years. I don't get it... They have your fingerprints? Yeah. But I... - How can they have your fingerprints? - No idea. But what is it, something to do with credit card fraud? Yeah, apparently, it's the cards. But I swear, I don't remember. - Okay. - That's all I know. But you... you promised me it was the only time. So, what? You're lying? No, I... I didn't say... No. Fred, you swore that it was just one time. Why didn't you tell me the truth? I want... I want to understand. Tell me the truth! You really think I wanted to tell you everything? Come on, for fuck's sake, don't make things any harder. Because I'm the one making things harder? Is that a joke? I'm the one making things harder? - No, but... - Wait, Fred. Let's get this clear. I paid the lawyer's fees, I exposed myself to my colleagues to find you a job, - and you've been lying the whole time? - Stop. I don't know you at all. - Of course you know me. - This is a nightmare. - You're nothing but a liar. - Be nice, Samia. I'm not one of your fucking students. Don't break my balls. - I'm in deep shit. - And I'm not in deep shit? - Don't shout. - I moved for you! You think I wanted to come and work here, in a town where I don't know anyone, where I only have you? You think I wanted that? I'm no thug's wife. I'm not waiting six years for you! I'm not waiting six years like a moron when you've been lying to me from the start! - This whole time? Unbelievable. - For fuck's sake, Samia! - And I'm breaking your balls? - I'm gonna do six years in prison. - Can't you think of me here? - That's all I've been doing! Do you get that? All I've been doing is thinking of you! I've been thinking about you for months! For months, I've been doing everything for you, thinking only of you! Calm down, Samia! Jesus. You're breaking my fucking balls. Go on, do whatever you have to. Guard! What are you doing? - Oh, I see. - Guard! That's how you're gonna deal with this? - Great. - Come on, let's go. Are you serious? Get a move on. Come on, let's go. Okay. So, what are you going to do? Finish up the year then go home. - I can't wait. - No, don't say that. I told my mom everything. She lost it. She had every right to. With her contacts at the Board of Education, she'll get me transferred back home. I want to go home so badly. I have no reason to be here. You're just going through a rough patch. Everything looks bleak. That's normal. Want me to tell you the truth? Honestly, for your first year... hat's off to you. You've done a great job. No, but I like the job. I give it my all. I enjoy it. But I'm alone here, Messaoud. Honestly, this year, it hasn't been easy. Between work, the students wearing me out, the trips back and forth to the prison, I'm going to lose my shit. Yeah, I get it. But I'm going to give it my all... for the students until the end of the year. That's all I have left. I'll give my all to try and save two or three of them, and then... then I'm off. What do you mean, save two or three? Do you know what you're saying? Samia, listen, I get it. You just got a punch to the gut. I imagine it can't be easy... but you need to take a step back. You need to be more realistic. You say work is wearing you out, but you're investing a bit too much in it. Can you imagine all the students we have? How many are there, hundreds? You can't be responsible for them all. It's impossible. We can't deal with everything. So, what do we try to do? We try to set them on the best path possible. That's not a bad start. Stop thinking it's all you have left. It's not. So, we have a real problem with Mr. Farid. Farid is constantly late. And the second problem we have is that he tells so many lies. If this carries on, we won't be able to let him come to class. He said my grades are good. Since the start of the month, Farid has been late nine times, nine! That's completely unacceptable. Go on, translate that for her. I got nine out of ten in math. - Oh, that's great! - Yeah. So, we're trying to find a solution for Mr. Farid Amoudi. That's why we called you in. He wishes he had more students like Farid Amoudi, and he wants to reward me. - No, really? - Really! Wallah. Wallah. On top of that, you swear to God? He's just translating lies because I told him I don't speak Arabic. Your son doesn't work hard in school, and he's always late. - Always late. - No. - And he's always lying. - All he does is lie! I'm going to start calling you at home. - Okay. - I'll let you know everything he's done. - Aren't you ashamed? - It's okay. - You liar! You imbecile! - Now you've set her off. - Aren't you ashamed? - Oh, you're good. It's Okay. You can beat him at home. It's constant, bro. I've known him since we were little. - He overdoes it, though. - All he does is lie. - Oh, the yogurt-thief is back! - What do you want? Got a problem? Hobo! Fleabag! What did you say to him? Like you can talk, snitch! You think 'cause Fodé's your friend, I won't fuck you up? Fodé isn't here. This is between you and me. What, just 'cause you sell 20 grams to a monitor, you think you're a gangster? - I'm gonna fuck your mother! - Go fuck yourself! You what? Want me to smash your teeth in? - I'm gonna fuck her. - I'm gonna kill you. Are you two serious? That's enough! Calm down! Stop! - Stop! Come with me! - It's him. He's a madman. - It's him. - I don't want to hear it! I just came from the principal's office, and everything's sorted for the extra food in the canteen. What's that? I've been working on this for weeks. As of next week, every Tuesday and Friday, students with the lowest family income can take home an extra portion of milk and fruit products. That's fantastic! Yeah, it was my main focus. - I'm so happy. - Well done. Well, the mood's about to change. Yanis and his mom are waiting outside. Can you please leave and ask them to come in? Sure. - Is this because of the fight? - It is. - Hey, Malika. - Hi, Moussa. - Hello, - Hello, madam. - Hello. - Hello, Yanis. I have a problem with Yanis, Mrs. Bensaadi. It's seeing him ruin his studies with behavioral issues and very little investment. Yanis doesn't tell me anything at home, so this is the first I'm hearing of it. I check his homework almost every night. It looks right. I know he's not a hard worker, but I didn't realize it was this bad. And other than the fight yesterday, I didn't know about his behavior. That's why I wanted to talk to you. Before the fight, there were several alarms raised by various teachers. We noted them in his liaison diary. - Okay, he hasn't showed you? - No. I've met with your son several times to get him to understand his attitude urgently needs to change. You've been called in several times, too? I want to help him, to motivate him, which is why I told him about the audiovisual VTC. Wait, Yanis, you haven't told your mom about the VTC? What's this VTC about? Why didn't you tell me? You're driving me mad. What are you playing at? What is your problem? You want to ruin your life while still in school? Got nothing to say? Uh... I'd calmed down, honestly. If it hadn't been for that fight... Uh... I know I still need to make more of an effort. - Are you interested in the VTC? - Yeah. Okay. Okay, now everyone knows what's going on. Hmm? It's a bit late, but this is your last chance, Yanis. I'd have preferred she yell at me. Even for her to hit me, insult me. But she didn't say anything. We got home, and she started crying. But, Yanis, I don't get you sometimes. You tell me the street life isn't for you. School isn't for you. So what do you want to do? I honestly don't know, Fodé. I really don't. It's hard for me. In all honesty, I'm a bit lost. My old man's in the clink. My mom's struggling. Yes, I mess about in school, but it's because I don't know what I want to do. Don't worry, anyway. I have no choice. I'm going to focus. I'm gonna work hard until the end of the year. I'm even gonna look into this training I was told about. Something to work in the movie industry. - What? In what? - The movie industry. - An audiovisual VTC. - Are you serious? I told you that's not for you. They think we're sabages. I can't see you doing that. Listen, I didn't want to tell you this yet, but I have to 'cause you're fucking up so much. Know what my plan was? - To open a little restaurant. - Oh, yeah? I wanted to open it with you. But you have to help me do that. At least get your diploma. I'll handle the money. Don't worry, I'm this close to getting it all. On my mother's life, you won't need to chip in a euro. - Isn't that great? - No, you're right, Fodé. Your idea is really tempting, but there's a problem. What problem? At the start of your speech, you said "sabages." I didn't hear a thing you said after that. - I didn't say "sabages." - On my mother's life, you did. Even if I did, so what? That's all you got out of everything I said? Yeah. You're always making crappy jokes to avoid things. Your mom's right. You're frustrating. I'm talking to you seriously about concrete stuff, investments, projects. You tell me about a cinema ATC? Did you decide to jump up my ass today? I'm gonna bounce. You giving me a lift? - You're just a kid, then? - You dropping me off? If not, I'm off. Look! Look! Come on, bro. - Hey, bro. - What? - Don't sulk! - Nah, it's cool. - Walllah. - It's all good. Hey, but don't forget that you said "sabages." Little bastard. Get home safe. - How's it hanging, guys? - Good. - How's business? - Good. Yes? Hey. - Hey. You wanted to see me? - Yeah. Take a seat. Okay... I'm sure you know why I've called you in here. No, I have no idea. I had a long chat with Reda Derkaoui yesterday. He told me all about his dealing. He ratted you out. - Ratted me out how? - Come on, let's not waste time. He told me how you took care of his detentions, his tardies, in exchange for weed. - Fuck. - I know everything. In all honesty, I can't believe it, Dylan. It's madness. What do you want to do about it? Listen, I don't want to call the police, to get you in deep shit, to get the school in deep shit. I've thought about it, and I suggest we sort this discretely. I won't tell anyone, and you'll hand your notice in today. Okay. What do I have to do to hand my notice in? You take a piece of paper and a pen... and explain why you want to leave. Find some excuse. I don't know, a job offer elsewhere. It might even be good for you, you've been here for five years. It can be a fresh start. I have no other solution. You haven't left me much choice. Lamine, six. If you only answer half the questions, you get a bad grade. - I'm not really a math guy. - You're a moron. Cindy, seven. Maintaining your average. Cruising along. Good. That's good. Three more points and I pass. Dewey. Kévin, sorry. Well, you've improved. Know how many you got right? No, how many? One. - No, what did I get? - You got one. What? That's good, though. That means I doubled my grade. What, doubled? Kévin, you had zero. Zero times two is still zero. No, I went from zero to one. That's double. I'm about this close to giving you a zero. Amel! Five. Fantastic, Amel. You invented new theorems, new theories. - It was... - You like joking, huh, sir? It was great. Yes, I love it. We're getting to know each other. Sofia, 12. What happened? Why didn't you answer the last question? You could've had the best grade in the class. Yanis, ten. - Your best grade this year. - See, mate? Yo, math is easy. If I really try, you're all screwed. - Yanis, you can still do better. - Yeah. So, the best grade in the class with a 13 goes to... the great Issa. - Obviously, I'm the best. - Well done. - You're all jealous. - So... - You only got six. - I got ten, mate. Issa, stand up and give a little victory speech. I forgot. Yes. I'd like to thank my parents, my friends, everyone who's supported me, Pythagoras, Thales... They're all family. I haven't forgotten my brothers from the 93, and Mr. Boufarra. Thank you. You can sit down now, Issa. Keep it up like that, you'll go into general tenth grade. - General tenth grade? No way! - Really, sir? Come in. Hello, I've brought you a latecomer. - Go and sit down. - Moussa, the dude from my building! - That's enough, Mamadi. - Moussa! Please, brother, get me out of here. Look what he's making us do. - Sums, Moussa! - All right. I'm not a moron like them. - You know me. - What's that supposed to mean? Sure, I mess around sometimes, but I don't deserve to be in this class. Know what he taught them yesterday? - He taught them to iron! - That's hard! - That's enough, Brahim. - No joke, I'm being serious. What's the plan for tomorrow, Play-Doh? Great idea! Let's mold Play-Doh tomorrow! He has great ideas! Play-Doh, Play-Doh! Play-Doh! Mamadi! That's not funny! Quiet, everyone. Quiet! God willing we mold Play-Doh. Mamadi, when you tell a story, on my mother's life, I don't understand a word. - You're a real SPED. - Forget it. I was talking about Farid with the hat. - Who's Farid with the hat? - Medhi's blue-eyed cousin. - The guy who went out with Jenny? - Right. Also, I think Jenny's got a crush on you. Dirty bastard! Are you mad? Look at her nose. She looks like Zlatan! If I go out with her, she'll keep giving me free kicks. - She's ugly as fuck. - I don't get it. What's going on there? Loads of police. There's been an accident. - Oh, yeah? - Let's check it out. - Shall we run? - He's in a rush! - You guys are nuts! - There's cops and everything! Lots of people. Let me pass, bro! You're too slow. Move your ass! - Wait. - It looks serious! Quit messing around, dicks. Hey. We should tell his mother. Yanis! Hey, Yanis. Yanis... Yanis, let's go see his mom. Yanis, come on. Come on! Salaam. - How are you doing, Yanis. - All right. - Want some tea? - No, thank you. Come with me, please. Let's go to his room. I just wanted to tell you... Fodé usually had a fair bit of cash hidden on top of his closet, behind the boxes, in a little bag. It was for a lawyer if he ever got caught. And so... I'm telling you so you can give it to his mom. You two can handle it. Okay. Thanks, Yanis. I'll take care of it. So, Goku evolves again, right? There's a huge burst of energy. He's surrounded by blue. It's insane. People see it and start to panic. When Vegeta sees him, he's so pissed off. It's mad. I won't tell you everything. See for yourself. - Hello. - Morning, Yanis. Here, Mrs. Zibra, my first three compositions. Well... I hope you like them! Thanks, Lamine. Shades, Harouna. Come to the student life office about your absences yesterday And so, it's the continuation of a process of European construction which leads us to the singing of the Maastricht Treaty. Okay? Remind me... what year was the signing? What year? We learned this last week. You exhaust me. Turn a page in your book and pretend. What year? Issa? 1992? That's right. Well done. Thank you, Issa. - No worries. - Can you wake up, please, Adam? How many member states at present? Wake up! Yanis? Honestly, I don't know. Well, you should know. This is basic stuff. We just saw it. Yeah, well, I don't know. Don't answer back. Thank you. - Leave me alone, for fuck's sake. - Sorry? - No, sir, leave it. - I won't. What did you say? He's a pain in the ass. Who do you think you are? - Yanis? - What? Repeat what you just said. You're breaking my balls! You get that? That was French. I'm warning you, Yanis. You can't hide behind your excuses! You can't do whatever you please 'cause your friend died! I've had friends who've died. In any case, that doesn't give you the right to act like this. Is that how you talk, you bastard? Go fuck yourself! I don't give a fuck about your friends or your shitty class! Fuck you! You've been waiting for this all year! You've gone too far. Out. - Amel, take him to Mrs. Zibra. - No, Amel, no, Mrs. Zibra! I don't need her or you! - Get out. - Shut up! - I don't give a fuck, bastard! - Get out! Never mention my friend again! Stupid fucking teacher's had it out for me all year. The principal will go over the facts. Teachers and parents will be able to ask questions. Just be yourself. Stay calm. Calmly explain to them what mood you were in. Everything should be okay. Mm-hmm. Whatever, you don't give a damn. You aren't even here next year. Hello. After insulting Mr. Bouchard several times and leaving the school grounds without permission, we didn't see Yanis for two days. I'll remind you this event took place just one week after Yanis was fighting in the yard, which led to a meeting with his mother. And all this came after he received multiple warnings for discipline-related issues. Okay, so before we get to the votes, - who wants to ask a question? - Excuse me, I'd just like... to clear something up. I intervened in yard last week. And actually, there was no fight. They had an argument. There was some shoving, but... it didn't go too far. Yes, but if you hadn't stepped in when you did, there would definitely have been a fight. Who else? - Can I say something? - Sure. I just wanted to say that for the last few weeks, Yanis has been trying. Yes, after that, he screwed up, lost his cool a bit, but you should factor in why. I agree with Amel. He realized that he needed to improve his file, because we found an interesting path for his future. Yes, we know that this event is inexcusable, but expelling him now would deal his file a critical blow. Especially since we know there's little chance of him being accepted to another school next year. I'm sure we can find another solution. Excuse me, Mrs. Zibra, but you just said it's inexcusable. So, why are we trying to excuse him? Yanis insulted me in class. They weren't low-key insults. What's the next step? He hits me? What do we say then, Poor Yanis had a series of extenuating circumstances? No. He isn't suited to the school system. That's it. It's no big deal. We tried. We kept him. We warned him all year, and it just keeps getting worse. If I may, I think Yanis has changed in the last few weeks. We can't deny that. - Oh, really? - True, it wasn't a revolution. I think we should draw a line under Yanis' attitude this week. No, I disagree entirely. No, but, Thierry, do we agree that we can't ignore the context? Okay. Thank you. Anyone else? - Can I say something? - Sure. Go ahead. Honestly, if I could've voted as a delegate, - I'd have voted for expulsion. - Yanis, please. Mr. Bouchard is right. I'm not suited to your system. I know I'm not dumb and I have abilities, like you said. But I can see that none of this is suited to me. Mrs. Zibra's really nice. She helps us. You can tell she wants the best for us and she really listens. But in all honesty, this VTC thing... They take 60 students out of the hundreds who apply. You really think that I, coming from here with my file, have a chance? Look what you did last year. You put all the messed up kids from seventh grade into the same class so we wouldn't disrupt others. You had nothing but problems with the eighth-grade NECs. It's bad enough we're in a city of thugs, in a neighborhood of thugs, in a school of thugs, and your idea is to put all these basket cases together? That's your plan for us? Yanis, you know very well that from eighth grade on, you're grouped by the electives you've chosen. So, what? You know very well the struggling kids aren't going to choose Latin, European languages, or anything else. Can't you combine the electives? Yanis, we all agree with you. The school system isn't perfect. We all agree. I'm with you on that. But you can't keep on blaming the system. That just won't do. I get what you're saying. So, what? Because you're in a school of thugs, a city of thugs, what, you do nothing all year? I disagree. Look at Issa. At the start of the year, your friend had problems. Issa worked hard, he tried, and now where is he? He's going into general tenth grade. Yes, but Issa's the exception of our class. I'm not. Excuse me, Yanis. Actually, it's our job, it's our job to ensure that a student can succeed. So, I'm not nice, like you said. I'm just here to show you there is another path.
