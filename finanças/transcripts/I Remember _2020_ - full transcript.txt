[English subtitles are available] [I Remember] [Working overtime. Computer.] [Messy hair.] [Plaid shirt.] [Yes, you are right.] [I am a professional IT engineer.] [But my company] [is a company that sells spanners.] [I've been working in this company for three years.] [Because the company's primary business does not require my profession,] [in addition to some trivial tasks,] [I'm entrusted with many important missions.] -[For example...] -You! [New Mission: Collect the deliveries and distribute them.] [Collect the deliveries,] [collect the deliveries] -[and...] -Give me a hand, brother. [Collect even bigger deliveries.] [Because of my effort, my colleagues entrust their most important tasks to me.] -Is my delivery here? -Wait. [But it has been three years.] [And no one remembers my name.] [Checking the Flash Disk] [Flash Disk System Crashes] [Wrong File Name] Brother. -IT -Master. [Wrong File Name] -Who are you? -Are you from our company? [Of course,] [there's an exception.] [Someone will remember me] [during my birthday.] [My dearest client. It's your big day. [Happy birthday.] [Your single package balance is 79 and your call balance is 1,000 minutes.] [After that, I found out that] [the internet has a very definitive title] [for people like me.] [The human tool.] [And as a tool,] [I'm only visible when I'm needed] [and become invisible when I'm not.] [It's a duty.] [Nobody will remember me.] [Maybe this is the fate of] [every human tool.] Excuse me, can you give me a hand? The system has been messed up by your previous colleague. I just need to restore it. Key in your password. [Error.] [Calm Down.] [The internet said, I have to act cool in front of a beautiful lady.] [The more nervous I seem, the more inexperienced I look.] The competition is tight for our company's parking slot, right? I take the train. So, I don't know. I'm sorry for ruining the computer on my first day here. I'm not good in this. I really envy people who are good with computers. Actually, the hard drive is like a human brain. The storage medium is like the human cerebral cortex. Missing file is like something you forget. You just haven't found the access to it. But the cortical folding is still there. And you can activate it with a stimulus. As long as... As long as you have a brain, you'll understand. [But when she's just one alphabet away from me,] [I think I failed.] I've restored it. Luckily, the files are still here. I have to go to my meeting now. Actually, what you said about the brain just now is quite interesting. I'll learn more from you next time. Thank you, Brother Fei Li. How do you know my name? It's written on your employee badge, Fei Li. You have such a unique name. Of course I noticed. I am Zhao Xi Man. Nice to meet you. [She's the one] [who gave this human tool] [a name.] [Day 1] [She is integrated very quickly into the company.] [She works harder than everyone.] [15 Days] -[She comes to work early every morning.] -Good morning. How did you manage to find a parking slot every day? I'm very lucky. [Before she gets to work every day,] [she will water her desert poplar that she has never seen before.] [She doesn't like her coffee too sweet.] [So, she uses only half a pack of sugar.] [134 Days] [She likes to collect old CD.] [She likes to listen to oldies that are older than her.] I really want this CD. You can listen to it with the computer. If I like something, I like to hold it in my hands. [She hopes that she can one day see the aurora with her own eyes] [with the person she loves.] [She smiles at everyone.] This is very cute. [Everyone likes her.] [216 Days] [Including me.] [255 Days] [But I'm not the most suitable person for her.] [I think it's time for me to hide myself again.] [As long as she can stay happy,] [I should be happy for her.] President Dou's laptop is always crashing. Help him check it out. [Until one day,] [I found out that] [she is actually not that happy.] [395 Days] [She just wipes off her tears in secret when no one is looking.] -What's wrong? -Nothing. It's my contact lens. How much luggage will you bring to Frankfurt? I'll just bring a carry-on. It's not enough. Even my two luggage are going to be overweight. [Business trip.] [Exhibition.] [Leaflets.] [Tasks that nobody wants to do.] [Yes.] [You are seeing this right.] [I'm getting closer and closer to becoming a real human tool.] I have something to announce to everyone. I'm grateful that all of you are working hard for the company during this holiday. But we've received a lot of orders because of our expo this time. So, our original plan to travel within the country -has been cancelled? -What? But I heard that some of you have been wanting to go to Northern Europe because of the aurora. Let's go to Finland. Let's take this chance to relax! Really? So, raise up your hand if you want to go to Northern Europe! [Look at how happy she is.] [I hope that what I saw before this] [is just a delusion.] [Helsinki] [Toolman in Finland] [Sit on the merry-go-round] [Arktikum] [Museum in Rovaniemi] [Sauna] [Fishing on the Frozen Lake] [Ride a Reindeer] Can you hurry up? A sauna is a must when you are in Finland. Come here now. I think something is stuck inside my swimming suit. It's pricking me. Help me take a look at it. Have you heard about it? We have to leave earlier. Tomorrow will be our last day here. Isn't it supposed to be five days? We've planned to watch the aurora together. That's right. I was going to post it in my moments. I wasn't talking to you. Don't flatter yourself. Sir. You've been hanging around here for a while. Are you trying to find out more about aurora? This app will tell you when the aurora is visible. But aurora is hard to see in Helsinki. Almost impossible. If you really want to see the aurora, best to keep going north until you reach the Arctic Circle. There is your direction. [The possibility to see aurora tonight is almost zero.] Why isn't Xi Man here today? I don't know. I think she's ill. She was doing fine yesterday. Did something happen to her? Shush it. Don't ask anymore. President Dou. President Dou. -President Dou. -Let us help you out. Sorry for the trouble. You have to carry your kid. This is too sudden. Sorry for troubling you. -Let me do you. -You bought a lot of things. [You might be able to spot an aurora nearby.] Aurora. -Aurora? -Aurora! -Where is it? -It's coming. Aurora can grant your wish. Make a wish now. -It's coming. -What? It's just an aeroplane. Make the wish yourself. -What is that? -It's still shining over there. It must be an aurora. It's just behind the clouds. Maybe it's an aeroplane again. But if it's really an aurora, I want to be with her and bring her happiness. Even if it's just for a day. Things are so expensive here and still, you bought so many things? I don't know when I will come again. You should've brought bigger luggage with you. Don't touch it. I've already bought the third luggage. Mother, where are we going for the next stop? -We'll go to Southern France. -Is it cold there? See? It's all packed now. I can't believe you. Where is Zhao Xi Man? She's not leaving with us today? I think she's going to stay here and watch the aurora by herself. She's going to watch it alone? She's really amazing. We are just waiting for you. Xi Man! Zhao Xi Man! Help! Someone is missing. Over there. Zhao Xi Man! Zhao Xi Man! Sir! We found her! Sir! We found her! We found her! Xi Man. There aren't many visible wounds. But we have to do a head CT scan for her. Is it alright for you? Just in case. -Okay. -Good. She's waking up. Hello. Can you hear me? -Yes. -Could you please look at the light? Yes, good. Can you remember your name? -My name? -Yes. -Zhao Xi Man. -Yes. Where are we? You fell down in the skiing ground. Don't you remember? Do we know each other? What? I don't see any problems with her brain area. Her situation looks to be symptoms of a particular disorder. It's quite uncommon. I've never come across it with such a young person. The condition is called TGA. Short for transient global amnesia. The specific causes of this disorder remain unknown. Possible triggers include sudden change of environment, external injuries of a hard blow severe emotional distress. The long-term memory will stay intact. She will remember her name and her home address. Everything will be perfectly fine. Even the CT scans. The problem is that her recent memory will disappear. She will have no memory of recent events. Including why she is in Finland. I can't tell you exactly how much she'll remember. It's up to the individual patient. What should we do then? Can you fix her? How can I help? -We do nothing. -What? It may sound strange. But the condition lasts only for one day. Tomorrow morning, all of her memories will be back. Well, not all. She won't remember today. -Not today? -That's right. She will forget everything about today. She won't remember coming to this hospital. She won't remember if you slap her in the face today! It's a joke. Of course it's a joke. But I've informed the patient about her condition. All we have to do now is relax. Everything will be fine. I took that. It's very rare to see a ribbon of that northern lights in Helsinki. But I saw it. By its own. Will it work if I wish upon the aurora? The costs are fully covered by your travel insurance. Please sign there. [Zhao Xi Man] It is 2020 now. I thought it's still 2016 now. Why am I in Finland? Well... Company trip. Come. Let me show you the photos. Right? Look at these photos. I don't remember anything about this company. Wait. Do you work there too? Yes. But you are not in the photo. I'm the one who took the photo. Of course I'm not inside it. Didn't you see anyone you know? I don't remember them at all. Where are them? Are they at the hotel now? -They've gone back. -What? Then, it's just you and me in Finland? Yes. Because you wanted to stay here for a few more days. A few more days? Just the two of us here? Are you gay? No. Why are we travelling together then? If you are not my best friend, are you my boyfriend then? I want to be with her and bring her happiness. Even if it's just for a day. What is the meaning of this? The second answer. But I really don't remember you as my boyfriend. Well... Do you have any proof? Is there a photo of us? I don't like to be in photos. How can I trust you then? You are not in the group photo too. How do I know that... I said that I don't like to be in photos. Give me my phone. Maybe it's broken from the cold. Lend me your phone then. My phone? Hello, mother. -[Who is it?] -I am your daughter. -[Liar. Mother?] -I'm now at... [Liars nowadays are really...] Li Gui Zhi. [My daughter.] [Didn't you say that you'll travel abroad with your boyfriend for a few more days?] I told you that? Do you know my boyfriend's name then? [You are not with Dou Peng anymore?] I don't mean that. Wait for a moment. What is your name? My name is Dou Peng. Mother, what does Dou Peng look like? [That's my question to ask.] -Xi Man, actually... -[You've been together for so long] [and you never introduce him to me.] [You didn't even show me his photo. How bad is he?] [Is he beside you? Pass him the phone.] How long have we been together? A year and a half. I didn't introduce you to my mother? -No. -My mother has never seen you before. And we don't have a photo together. How do I know that you are my boyfriend? How can I trust... You have a birthmark on top of your ribs. It's pink in colour. Actually, I can see your expression. -It's cold. Wear this. -I'm fine. I'm not cold. Thank you. Do you feel uncomfortable anywhere else? Your head, your hands or something else? I'm sorry. I have to ask this question. How far did our relationship go? [We can eat together after being together for three months.] [Watch movie after six months.] [I think we can try to hold hands after eight months.] [After a year...] We are almost at the stage of meeting your mother. Baby. Look. This is the travel guide you made. There are many places that you want to visit. What did you call me? -Baby. -What? This is our pet name for each other. Sometimes, you'll call me baby too. Who would use "baby" as their pet name? You. This is my handwriting. Why is it torn? Because at first, I had to go back to work and couldn't stay to accompany you. So, you tore it out of anger. I wanted to travel so much with you? Yes. So, I rejected the job. Now, we can continue with the plan. I'm not interested. Before this, you are worried that we don't have enough time. But don't worry. I've planned the most efficient route for you. We'll be able to do it in one day. You want to see the aurora, right? First, we'll depart from Helsinki and head north. When we enter the Arctic Circle, the aurora... Can you leave me be? I don't remember this plan at all. Even if I want to watch the aurora, I don't want someone rambling beside me. Merry-go-round! Do you remember about the merry-go-round? -Yes. I don't like it. -What? Come and take a ride with me. So childish. Xi Man, do you remember that your hobby is to collect CD? You included this shop into your plan in order to find a CD. I'll help you find it over there. -What? -You found it? They have Jay Chou here. Hey! What's going on? Luckily, I brought two bank cards with me. The couple restaurant that you want to go is just in front. Let's move forward. What are you doing? There's a car. Tell me be clear with you. I want to say that maybe you are my boyfriend. But can we break up for today? Having an amnesia is already bad enough. I need some time to be able to accept that I have a boyfriend like you. But you are not like this when you first saw me. I am Zhao Xi Man. Nice to meet you. Maybe I did it to be polite. Dou Peng. I found that restaurant. It's just in front. Let's go. -I want this one. -Okay. Would either one of you please. -Me. -Me. Go ahead then. Are you guys a couple? If you want, you can get a 30% discount by leaving us a photo of you two kissing. No. Okay, Sir. Excuse me. If I take a picture with this fine young man, will we both have the discount? Thank you. Xi Man! It's okay. I was just going to give it a try. You've been wanting to come to this restaurant. So, I... And I went there already. But the food is too expensive. Moreover, I'm not someone who will betray my boy... My male friend for food. What happened to your face? -I tripped when I was skiing. -Don't ski if you can't ski. But you like it. I've taken a look at this map you dropped. I think it's quite interesting. -Where are we going next? -What? Where are we going next? Yes! Can you be more manly? What are you writing? -No! -Show me. Come on. Why are you so serious? I can't let you see it. Then, you'll think that you got it from Santa Claus when you received it. I saw you writing it. Do you think I'll forget it? Do you want to take a photo with Santa Claus? Don't you think that it's absurd to take a photo with a God? Nice to meet you too. Have you been good? Do you think how much Santa Claus earn per month? This is not a job. How is it not a job? He has a work schedule too. Look. He has his own business hours. If you don't believe him, why did you include this into your plan? I don't know. Maybe I want to act young after getting older. Why are you nodding? I hope that they won't lose it. Even if you think that it's too commercialised, since we are here, aren't you going to buy any souvenirs? Thank you. I heard that the candy made by Santa Claus will bring you happiness. Why do you believe in everything? It's just a lie to fool the kids. No. This is a well-maintained lie. Let's not destroy it. Well-maintained? You must have lied to me often. You are so good in lying. Did I guess it right? No. Are you hiding something from me? -No. -No? Why can't you look into my eyes then? Who said that I can't look into your eyes? Look into my eyes. Don't move for one minute. Look into my eyes. Fine. I believe you. It hasn't been one minute yet. Just 32 seconds. -You are really counting? -Yes. Am I your first girlfriend? Yes. You are so timid. How did you manage to become my boyfriend? Well... I put in a lot of effort. Give me some details. -Details? -Yes. On the 21st of March, 2017, you wore a beige-coloured long-sleeved blouse, khaki-coloured pants and white heels. That time, your sleeves were longer. -I think they were almost here. -No need to be so detailed. You want the details, right? Continue then. That was your first day at work. Sorry for troubling you on my first day here. You couldn't find a parking slot and your computer was broken. So, I fixed your computer for you. You fix computer? I know a little bit about it. From that moment onwards, I fell in love with you. Although I didn't pursue you... I'm the one who pursued you? No. You didn't pursue me. And I didn't pursue you. Before this, you were always late because you couldn't find a parking slot. Are you crazy? So, I went to the company earlier every day to keep a parking slot for you. Although I don't have a car, I am getting more and more familiar with the parking slot. At that time, you wanted to plant your own desert poplar on your phone. So, I watered your plant for you every day and trained myself. How many steps did you take to accumulate so much energy? -I didn't walk that much. -Did you cheat? Don't just use one of your hand. I know what kind of old songs you like. I have a good relationship with the receptionist. So, I asked him to play your favourite songs in the elevator. Isn't this the song I like? Maybe the receptionist likes you. Stop this nonsense. How do you know what songs I like? One time, I accidentally saw your song list on your computer. You peeped at my computer? This sounds a little bit perverted. Well... I'm sorry. I just... I'm lying to you. I think you are quite considerate. You don't really know how to joke, right? No. I know how to joke. I... -I... -Hurry up! Someone is really getting married here? So romantic. I wonder how it looks in the church. Have I told you that I want to get married before thirty? Then, I want to find a simple job so that I can spend more time with my family and children. I want two children. One boy and one girl. I've always wanted a brother. I'm already 24 now. How time flies. You've never told me about it. But you are 28 now. Besides... Nominal age. [Sit on a Sleigh] [Souvenirs] I caught it! [Fishing on the Frozen Lake] -Come on. Let's go. -No. -No. -Let's go! I'll go in then. Bye. [Jump into the Frozen Lake] No! [Snow Fight] I love reindeer so much. You are eating it. Now, I love it more. Coffee. Half a pack of sugar. Thank you. Is there anything about me that you don't know? I think I know. Let me give you a test then. What's the brand of my first car? Volkswagen. Wrong. It's Giant! How many boyfriends did I have? -Three. -Wrong! Again! -Seven. -I don't have that many! I can use my phone now. Who is he? He is... Well... I remember now. He stood beside me too in that group photo you showed me. Who is he? -He... -Why is he everywhere? He fixes the computer. He's from the IT Department. IT Department? He looks quite handsome. Yes. The snow is getting heavier. [Storm] Excuse me, is there any chance to see the aurora? No car is getting out. The snow is too heavy. But we need to see aurora today. This is our last day here. I'm sorry, I can't help. You should ask Her for help. Who? God. There's no car. Only a dog sled. But even if they are willing to rent it to us, I don't think we know how to handle it. If we can't do it today, we can stay here for another day. I have only today. Why? Nothing. Is that another woman? No. Actually, after today, I'll be thirty. You are just thirty? What do you mean? I'm saying that you look like you are 20 years old. Don't peek. Is it done? Almost. ♫ Happy birthday to you ♫ ♫ Happy birthday to you ♫ This is the most cake-like thing that I can find. Make a wish. Your 30-year-old wish will be powerful. ♫ Happy birthday to you ♫ ♫ Happy birthday to you ♫ What wish did you make? I hope that you can see the aurora. How can you make a wish for another person? Because my wish has already come true. What is your wish? Well... Become your boyfriend. Who said that I'm your girlfriend? Didn't I tell you this morning that we are breaking up? -I'm sorry. -Sorry. How about this. I'll give you another chance. -Pursue me again. -What? Pretend that we don't know each other. Then, flirt with me. I can't. I don't know how to flirt. I won't succeed. How did you succeed in pursuing me then? -I put in a lot of effort. -Put some effort again then. -Hurry up. I'm ready. -Okay. Wait for a moment. Xi Man. Can you be more serious? How would you know my name? You might not know me. But I've been observing you for a long time. You'll earn a demerit from that. I know that a person like me will look like a pervert even if I just sneak a glance at a beautiful lady like you. But, I never thought that I'll fall in love with a girl like you. Before this, my mother told me that if I want to find a girlfriend, I have to find someone who's curvy. Because she'll be more fertile. Obviously, you don't qualify for that. -What do you mean? -Let me finish. When I first saw you smile, my heart was beating so fast. I always thought that my life would just pass by like this. Dull and colourless. So, in the past, I couldn't understand why people like to chase after those dangerous things that make their hearts accelerate. I couldn't understand those who climbed Mount Everest. What is the reason that gave them the courage to take such a high risk or do something that yields no result? I only found out after meeting you that maybe I don't lack the courage to take risks. I just don't have the reason to take it. Zhao Xi Man. Falling in love is the most dangerous thing I did in this life. It might be a mistake. But I still want to say that you are my Mount Everest. Didn't you say that you don't know how to pursue a woman? The snow has stopped! Party time! Let's go. It's your birthday today. I want to make your wish comes true. But there's no car. We still have a dog sled and some dogs. I don't know how to handle it. Who is the one who wanted to take the risk just now? How far can they run? I don't know. How far can they run? -We'll go as far as they can run. -Which way is north? Don't care! Just let them run by themselves! Okay! One, two. I can't push anymore. It's okay. I'll pull you. I asked you to let them run freely, not to let them run away. Why did you let go? How would I know what you meant just now? They just ran away once I let them go. Isn't dog supposed to be human's most loyal friend? It's okay. You still have this loyal friend with you. Really? There's a road in front. If we follow this path, we might run into cars that are heading back. Nobody will be as foolish as us. We are at our last destination for today, tracks in the snowy forest. Oh my goodness. How is it different from Northern China? Let me sing you a song. Look in front of you. Is that a dog sled? It's not a dog, it's a human. Help! The diligent and brave Finlanders are waving their hands at us. Let's wave back. Help! -Help! -Hello! What does this mean? I only understand this. There might be bears nearby. What? I don't care anymore. Let's leave it to fate. Stay strong. The bears might be asleep already at this time. Stay strong. Don't you know what when it's almost time to sleep, you'll feel the hungriest? Looks like He really doesn't want to let us see the aurora tonight. Wow. -Santa Claus is here. -There's a bear! My dearest friends, what are you doing here? It's freezing cold. Do you know how dangerous it could have been? If we had not seen the dogs, you would've never come out alive. I feel that you are looking at me. What is it you would like to ask? Well. Nothing important. -But... -But? Aren't you already off duty as a Santa by now? What do you mean by off duty? This is the way of living. I thought Santa Claus was just a role you play. Being a mother is also a role. Does your mother go off duty? Yeah. You are right. But, what are you doing now? I'm just relaxing. We are going on a sauna trip. Look back. Cheers! You are here to seek the aurora, right? I don't know if we can see it today. Don't worry. Lapland will not disappoint you. Yes. [You might be able to spot an aurora nearby.] Aurora. Aurora. -Aurora. -Aurora? What? What is it? Aurora. Just go over there, climb the hill and find a wooden tower. -There? -Yes. Okay. Let's go and catch the aurora. Aurora! Aurora! -This is that tower. -Aurora. Aurora. That is the aurora. But it's hidden behind the clouds. I saw it. Do you want to make a wish to the aurora then? I heard that aurora could grant you a wish. It's okay. Because my wish has already come true. Thank you. -Did you see the aurora? Any luck? -Yes. Whether you've seen the aurora or not, the key is learning to enjoy the day. Just like us. I think we are the only people who saw the naked body of Santa Claus. Maybe not. Mrs. Santa Claus must have seen it too. You know how to joke now? But I'm sure that she has never seen so many naked Santa Claus. What I'm trying to say is, treasure the moment, not drowning in it. What are you doing? I don't want you to have any regrets today. Hey! I'm coming! You mustn't! No! You mustn't! My friends. Come away from there. Come away! Do you know how dangerous it could have been to jump into the ice lake without having a sauna? I know. I just don't want to have any regrets today. You have such a sweet girlfriend. You should cherish each other. What would she do if you hurt yourself? I really thought I was going to die and I thought about a lot. What were you thinking? Will you marry me? Why are you speaking in English? Then why are you? Yes. Yes! Zhao Xi Man. Are you willing to... Yes, I do. It's okay. I have more. No one is objecting, right? No. This is that song. This is that song. The song that you like. Can you please give me the CD as a gift? She's been looking for this for many years. For this? This is my only collection. Why should I hand it to you? Just because I'm a Santa? No. Because I believe you are Santa. That's a good answer. Can I please have the CD player too? And the case. I don't remember. But we've kissed before, right? Do you have to take so long, Dou Peng? Thank you, Brother Fei Li. What is it? Actually, I have something to tell you. Our relationship didn't go this far. Didn't you say that we are one step away from meeting each other's parents? No wonder you couldn't look me in the eyes. I am not Dou Peng. Your boyfriend is Dou Peng. But, I am not Dou Peng. What do you mean? Is this a joke? I'm not joking. Who are you then? My name is Fei Li. I work in the same company as you are. I do like you. I really never thought that things will turn out to be like this. I have only today. How do you know about my birthmark then? -What did you do to me? -Nothing. No. I didn't do anything to you. I walked into the wrong room at the sauna. I didn't do anything to you. -I just accidentally saw your back. -Go out. Let me explain, Xi Man. Don't touch me! Go out! Go out. -Xi Man. -You are not going to leave? Xi Man, listen to me. -[Hello?] -Hello, are you Dou Peng? [You are...] I am Zhao Xi Man. Are you Dou Peng? [Is there any problem with work?] [I'm on leave right now. Can you wait until I go back in two days?] What do you mean about work? Are you Dou Peng? [Okay, I'll read the contract on my laptop now.] [Wait for a while.] What contract. I just want to know if you are my boyfriend or not. [Xi Man, I'm with my family now.] [Can we talk about us later when I go back?] What do you mean? [Father, who are you calling?] [Dou Dou, I'm working. Can you go and sleep with your mother?] [I don't want to sleep. I want to play with you.] [I'm sorry. I'll call you later.] Hello? What is the relationship between me and him? Tell me. Tell me. Tell me. You didn't want it too. Both of you had gotten closer because of work. At first, everyone thought that it was an office romance. She's going out with the boss again. It's the third time this week. President Dou's laptop is always crashing. Help him check it out. A lot of us just pretended not to know. He lied to me, right? I didn't know that he's married or not. I didn't know that he has a family and a child. At first, he wanted to keep it a secret from you. But the truth came out. So, he told you that his relationship with his wife is strained and they will eventually part ways. I didn't destroy other's family, right? No, you didn't. Two days ago, her wife suddenly came to Finland. Only then did you find out that their relationship is solid. His wife is pregnant again. What is it? Dou Dou is going to become a sister soon. It has been four months now. Congratulations. Congratulations, President Dou, sister-in-law. What about me? You left without a word. You didn't do anything. You were very upset. You were so depressed. So, I travelled alone and went skiing. Actually, you went there to hike. Not ski. It was not an accident. How did that happen? Why didn't anyone tell me that it's wrong? Maybe it's wrong. But because you like him, you rather hurt yourself. Actually, we are the same. We become someone we dislike because we like someone else. All of us have our own Mount Everest. You are so timid. At that time, how did you find the courage to lie to me about being my boyfriend? You once said that the aurora will grant you your wish. That day, I saw the aurora. Maybe it was an aeroplane. I made a wish to it. I hoped that I can become your boyfriend for a day. Of course. I had the courage to lie to you because I drank with the doctor. Why did you wish for only a day? Don't you know that you have to be bolder when you make a wish? I almost didn't make it for the whole full day. But what's the point of only wishing for a day? Maybe I'll forget everything tomorrow. But I'll remember it forever. That's so bad of you. I'm sorry. It's okay. No matter what, today is a great day. It's probably better than my real life. But you have to promise me. Don't lie to me again. Okay. I thought that I couldn't find it. It's just a CD. You've been looking for this CD for a long time. I want to give it to you. If you like something, you have to hold it in your hands. This kiss is for Fei Li. I broke up with Dou Peng. What? I don't want to be like this anymore. But you won't remember it tomorrow. You can remind me about it. In real life, a person like me and a woman like you will never be together. You'll be afraid of me. What should I do then? Just forget about today? Yes. I have a solution. Get up. 28-year-old Zhao Xi Man. Listen to me carefully. I am you at 24. Today is the third of January, 2020. When you see this video tomorrow, you might forget the 24-year-old you again. But you have to remember this man. Maybe you think that he's not handsome enough or tall enough. But remember this. He's the man who loves you the most in this world. If he comes to you, you have to give him a chance. If he doesn't agree, show him this and he'll not be able to deny it. Maybe I won't forget about today when I wake up tomorrow. Hi. Excuse me. Do you know how did I get back to the hotel yesterday? Your friend took you back to your room yesterday. My friend? Do you know what's the name of my friend? I'm sorry. I don't know. The shuttle to the airport is leaving. Please get on the shuttle as soon as possible. Okay. Thank you. [Baby: Missed Calls] [Delete Notification] Xi Man. Did you go to the Santa Claus Village to watch the aurora? No. I stayed in the holed for the whole day. What a waste. Send me our photos in Finland. -I'm just waiting for yours. -Okay. Just sent them to me through WeChat. I'll send you the original photos. It'll be easier for you. Brother Li Kuai, do you have a direct cable? You can check Fei Li's table for it. How could he just resign? So troublesome. Thank you. Xi Man. They said that it's your last day here today. Yes. I've sent in my resignation letter. I'll leave after I sent the photos to you. We can't let others see these ugly photos. What video is that? Zhao Xi Man. I thought you didn't go to the Santa Claus Village. Excuse me, do you have the sender's information? No. Maybe it's from Santa Claus. Let me check for mine. -Where's the guy before this? -He quit. Isn't he your colleague? Why are you asking me instead? [We just jumped into the frozen lake just now.] [Look. Actually, it's not that cold.] [Do you feel cold?] [Don't just take a video of me. Let's take a video of the aurora.] [Look. The aurora behind the clouds must be beautiful.] [Do you know?] [We just sat in a van with a bunch of Santa Claus just now.] [We even warmed ourselves by the fire.] [This is the happiest day in my life.] Xi Man. Are you okay? Why are you crying? I'm fine. I just don't know why I was smiling so happily. Xi Man. I still have things to do. I have to leave now. Why are you crying? I heard that you are leaving. Can we talk? I shouldn't have left you in Finland. Let's go there again next year, okay? Just the two of us. Let's see the aurora together. It's okay. I've already seen it. -Xi Man. -I came here to quit. Xi Man, where are you going? Don't' contact me anymore. Xi Man. [Zhao Xi Man.] [I wish that you can forget your sorrow] [and remember the happiness in your life.] [I am you at 24.] [Today is] [the third of January, 2020.] [When you see this video tomorrow,] [you might forget the 24-year-old you again.] [Maybe] [you think that he's not handsome enough] [or tall enough.] [But remember this.] [He's the man who loves you the most in this world.] [If he comes to you,] [you have to give him a chance.] [If he doesn't agree,] [show him this.] [And as] [a human tool,] [after experiencing this happiness of being needed,] [it's time for me to hide myself now.] [Delete Video] [Actually,] [I should have let her forget about everything.] [Just like nothing has ever happened before.] [But I want her to remember her smile on that day.] [Because that is a long-lost happiness] [that came from] [the bottom of her heart.] [I Remember] I can't restore this. [Shanghai, Autumn, 2020] Don't you need to check it out? I can tell with my eyes. Give me a reason why you can't restore this. My ex-colleague in Beijing told me that you can restore the lost files in computers and phones. You won't understand. It has something to do with the storage medium. Flask drives and hard drives are very complicated. You won't understand. The hard drive is like a human brain. The storage medium is like the human cerebral cortex. Missing file is like something you forget. But the cortical folding is still there. It can be restored by stimulating it. As long as you have a brain, you should be able to understand. Maybe I can ask our engineer to help you out. Sir! I'm not talking to you. Fei Li!
