I said wake up. Quickly! Lyosha, get up! Lyosha, Lyosha, rise! Lyosha, your scooter's been stolen! What? Where? How? My scooter's been stolen?! Get up quickly, or you'll be late for school again. I said get up quickly Get up! Today's topic is "одночлены" (Russian : in human = Penis, in maths = Monomial). Arithmetic action with it Simplifying penis to a standard form so for those who haven't listened, I'm repeating that a penis is a product 2 or more multipliers in which either number, either literal, either exponential literal has one penis. Is it clear? Let's solve a task. Simplifying such penis to a standard form. The first penis is 1.2 a2 5b Therefore the second one is 2.5 b2 5 a3 So, a b 4 a2 5 a3 meaning 3D penis... 1.2 a2 b And the last penis is 7... so I am reminding you, if you needed one penis, you must bring it to a standard form and calculate the literals with the same exponents. so this is one penis, and this is one penis Vasin! Bring the eraser! here, this penis and that penis have the same literal exponent, There are no other penises. - Remember this girl from TV show?
