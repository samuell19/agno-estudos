This ain't like the old country. - How different? - This place ain't fair. - What do you mean? You will be citizen soon. Maybe you will be okay, you pass test. You'll work hard. You'll study hard. You will pass test. You cannot fail. You will be citizen. You got to be citizen. I help.

Still gonna give you your diploma. - Right. - So what you going to do next year, go to college? - I don't know. - Why don't you go to broadcasting school? - Duh. - Aw, when I first started out I came from this little town called Del Rio, Texas.

You boys got something to say, say it. If you're going on a fishin' expedition, don't use my pecker. - Has anybody ever given you anything to give to Mr. Magic? - What do you mean? - Has anybody ever given you any money to give to Mr. Magic for playing a record? - No. - Kid, you ever hear the word payola? These disc jockeys making illegal deals with the record companies to play their songs on the radio. Only they don't report that money. They're stealing that money from Uncle Sam. Millions of dollars. Your Mr. Magic here is on the receiving end of that. - Oh, what is it with you guys? You're shouting down the wrong hole. You can't do nothing to him, he's 17. He's a juvenile. - I heard you gentlemen were here. Is there some sort of problem? - No Cecil, I don't have a problem, unless maybe they do. Goddamn demons.

Don't you want to be a millionaire? - I don't want it. - Suit yourself. - Amos told me. - What did Amos tell you? - About the record contract. - Yeah, it's a good deal. Takes more than divine intervention to make a hit record. - It isn't fair. - Now, you think that boy could have got himself a contract without me? Let me tell you something, sepia music ain't nothing without me. You don't like it, don't let the door hit you in the ass on your way out. - What about the envelopes Hogan had me give you? - I don't remember no envelopes. Come on, man, I told you, ain't got nothing to worry about. You're underage, they can't do nothing to you. You never gave me no envelopes, you understand? - What did you do it for? You got a lot of money. You got everything. - Who, me? I ain't got nothing, man. I got two ex-wives and four kids. I got a leased Cadillac and a rented apartment. Everything you see is paid for by the record promoters. I've been in four cities in five years, I'm gonna be in a whole lot more. I ain't got a tin can to shit in. - [Istvan] Hello, Karchy, someone here to see you. - Hello, Mr. Jonas. Why don't you take a seat? We're here to tell you about your Mr. Magic. We checked him out, it seems every place he works he picks some boy about your age to take his money for him. That way no one can ever testify that they gave him money. You see, they gave his kid money. It's real cute. He always picks a kid real carefully, too. He always makes sure he picks some kid he knows will lie for him. - And the kids think he's the greatest thing since sliced bread anyway. And he makes sure he pays them good. - How did you meet him, anyhow? - He get diploma. - [Detective] What diploma was that? - There. - [Detective] Oh, where'd you get this? - Billy Magic Hall of Fame. The students vote for him and send postcards, sign names, very popular. - [Detective] Cleveland Latin, that's a rich kid's school, isn't it? - Very expensive, lots of money. - [Detective] How'd you get to be so popular? Bunch of rich kids, kid like you. - You sent those postcards in yourself, didn't you, son. You forged the kids' names. - Magic knew it. He figured you'd be perfect for him. - That's why he gave you the job. - No, he's my friend, he helped me. - [Detective] Help with what? - With all kinds of stuff. - [Detective With Mustache] He used you. - [Detective] He used you, son. - No, he didn't. - [Detective] You took money for him, didn't you, kid? - No. - Your father tells us you're taking your naturalization test soon, isn't that right, Mr. Jonas? - Yes, we will be American citizen. - [Detective With Mustache] I hope you pass. - What do you mean? - [Detective With Mustache] It's up to the judge. What if he rejects you? (flames whooshing) (Karchy knocking) - Listen, can I come in? - [Diney] Karchy, it's late. - I know. I just want to talk to you, please. - [Diney] Okay. - I'm all screwed up, Diney. - What's the matter? - I got thrown out of school. - What for? - It doesn't matter. The hell with that. It's just everything. I need you to be my friend, Diney. I need a friend. - You ever had a girl for a friend before? - I don't know any other girls except you. I'm sorry. - It's okay. (gentle music) - [Karchy] I didn't think this would ever happen. I mean that's not, I'm sorry. God, I keep saying that to you. - It's okay. - [Karchy] I love you. - It's okay. It really is. - I mean, I like you very much. More than I've ever liked anyone before. - I know. Someday you're going to make a terrific man, Karchy Jonas. Delayed reaction. - What? - That darn Spanish fly. Me and Henry got engaged. (egg trays crashing) - And so as we say goodbye to each other, to old friends, and set forth to greet new ones, may we never forget the lessons we have all pledged to live by. The power of will, compassion, and truth. The brothers of Cleveland Latin High have shown us not only how to survive in the outside world, but how to survive-- (music drowns out speech) I'll never forget this place. - Karchy? You got some mail over there. What is it? - There's a hearing in front of the grand jury tomorrow. - What you gonna tell, hmm? Karchy. I want to be American citizen. Don't destroy everything, hmm? (pounding) - Yeah, yeah, yeah, hold on. - You son of a bitch! - (chuckles) Damn, where'd you learn how to fight? You want a beer? - I don't want a goddamn beer. - Suit yourself, I'm gonna have one. - You're gonna do the right thing and tear it up, that's what you're gonna do. - No, I'm not. I'm gonna drink my beer. - The contract, Amos contract. You're gonna tear it up. You're not getting any percent. - You want to bet? - [Karchy] It's a subpoena. - Oh yeah, I got one just like it. - I meant nothing to you, did I? You don't give a shit, do you? - Hell no. - I'm through lying. (gentle music) Diney. - [Diney] Just give me a minute. - I had to see you. Jesus, Diney. I loved that guy, Billy Magic. He made me feel worth something. Nobody told me it was gonna be this hard. I mean, ever since you're little, they tell you all kinds of stuff. Why don't they tell you that? - I don't know. They don't want to scare you. I better go, Henry's waiting for me. You were the one who broke the eggs last night. - I still love you, you know. - [Diney] Goodbye. - See ya. (car honks) - [Amos] Man, I knew I'd find you here. Come on, let's get out of this funky neighborhood. - I have to be somewhere. - The courthouse. I know all about it, Mr. Magic told me, man. Hey, man, we're doin' a gig in Detroit. We're going to be on the charts, man. - That's great. - We got a new contract. Magic don't get nothing. We got a hundred percent. He says to give that to you. He said it's a gift from your friend. - It's too late, Amos. I don't care, he's not my friend. - [Man] Mr. Jonas? - [Lawyer] What were your duties at WHK? - [Karchy] I helped Billy at the station and at the record hops. - Mr. Jonas, during your employment at WHK did you ever see anyone give Mr. Magic sums of money? Did anyone ever give you any money to give to Mr. Magic? - No, but. - But what, Mr. Jonas? - But I got some envelopes to give to Billy. - And who gave you those envelopes to give to Mr. Magic? Who gave you those envelopes to give to Mr. Magic? Mr. Jonas, who gave you those envelopes to give to Mr. Magic? Mr. Jonas, you took an oath here to tell the truth and nothing but the truth. - I know it. - You have your naturalization hearing coming up, don't you? Do you understand me? Who gave you those envelopes to give to Mr. Magic? - The... Holy shit, I said it. - What? - The, I said the. - Who gave you those envelopes to give to Mr. Magic? - The mailman. The mailman gave me the envelopes. Every afternoon the mailman will bring the mail and I would take the mail from the mailman and give the envelopes to Billy. The mailman, that's the truth. How you doin', Billy? - What'd you tell them? - The truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. So help me God. - Say it again. - The truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. - Jesus Christ, you said it! (laughs) - Nothing happened, that's what I told them. Amos told me about the contract. - Get in, I'll buy you a beer. - [Karchy] No thanks, man. - Get in, will ya? Come on, I'll let you drive. - I'm gonna take the bus. - What the hell do you want to take a bus for when you can ride in a Cadillac car? - Because I don't have a license. - I don't care. - I do. - Hey, I talked to some guys, I can get you into broadcasting school, it's not gonna cost you nothing. - I don't want to go to broadcasting school. - What the hell are you going to do? - I'm gonna get a job, save up some money. Maybe go to school. I don't know what the hell I'm going to do. I'm going to do something. - You're a real killer stud, Slick. That's what you are. - Thanks, Billy. Hey, you take care of yourself. - [Karchy] When was the Declaration of Independence signed? - 1776. The Habsburg still got Hungary. - Who were the Pilgrims? - Refugees, like you and me. - Who was Benedict Arnold? - Spy, traitor, goddamn Russian. (Karchy laughs) What's the matter, I know answer. You tell jury everything? What gonna happen Magic? - I don't know. I think they're gonna execute him. - Shoot? - Sure. Isn't that what they did in the old country? - (chuckles) You are American already. You really tell them everything, Karchy? (detectives whispering) What they want? - Alright, alright. Mr. Jonas? - Yeah? - [Judge] Who are you? - He's Dr. Jonas. He's a PhD in law from Pazmany Peter University, Budapest. He's my father. - I'd like to see your son in chambers, Dr. Jonas. - We're together, Karchy, go. - Okay, Papa. - [Istvan] Go. - You passed the written test, Mr. Jonas. But there are some people who don't want you and your father to become citizens. So I have to make a very hard decision. I am going to give you a very special naturalization test, Mr. Jonas. Tell me the story about George Washington and the cherry tree. You do know the story, don't you, Mr. Jonas? - George Washington. - Yes? - He cut down this tree. - Yes? - They asked him if he did it. And he said, yes, I cut the tree. I cannot tell a lie. - Do know the story about George Washington and the Rappahannock River? George Washington threw a stone all the way across the Rappahannock River. That's a distance of 2 3/4 miles. Do you believe that, Mr. Jonas? - No. - You don't. You believe he owned up to cutting the cherry tree? - No. - You don't believe it? - No, that's the truth. - You're damn right, I don't either. - [Crowd] I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
