(upbeat music continues) - [Liv] There's a reason they call Christmas the most wonderful time of the year. It's a time of reflection and tradition that brings out the best in people. Well, usually. There's the 85 foot Christmas tree in Union Square. It's the centerpiece of San Francisco during the holidays. And the Fairmont Hotel with its life size gingerbread house in the lobby. It invites people to enjoy what I love about Christmas, wonder, warmth, and elegance. (upbeat music) And then there's my parents. To them, Christmas is one big, loud, overblown carnival. (upbeat music) Mom, dad. - Hi honey. - You guys really need to start giving things away. You've become Christmas hoarders. - Why would we give things away, we're still using them. - Well, maybe you need to stop buying new things every year. This place is a fire hazard. - Oh, speaking of fire hazards. (whimsical music) - You've really outdone yourself. - Isn't it great? - You know when people think Christmas, they don't usually think, dragon. - What would you rather pull in your sleigh, a reindeer with a glowing nose or a fire breathing dragon? Perfection. - Hi, dad. Ooh, hard at work? - I'm still trying to figure out my signature dish for the party. I've never been this far behind. Braised abalone and cranberry sauce didn't go as well as I hoped. - Dad, I know you and mom like to go a little extra for Christmas, but maybe one of these years you could try scaling it back just a little. Make it more intimate and less crazy, loud Asians. Plenty of people have lovely, low key, totally normal Christmas parties every year. - Let other people have boring, normal Christmas parties. This is the Changtastic Christmas party. - Exactly, it's the Changtastic Christmas party. I can't remember the last time we celebrated as a family without the entire neighborhood. - You should be proud that so many who wanna spend time with us. I mean, is it our fault that more show up every year? - That's what makes it so special. Though, it does make my signature dish a bigger challenge each year. - I believe in you, honey. You go into that kitchen and you make me proud. - You're right, if you'll excuse me, I have a recipe for nutmeg mapo tofu I've been meaning to try. - So, you bringing anybody to the party this year? - Flying solo as usual, 'tis the season to be independent. - That doesn't even make sense, this is the season for love. - I thought that was Valentine's Day. - It's love, it can only have one season? You haven't invited anyone in years, not even a friend. This is the 25th anniversary of our party. - Can we not talk about this right now? Please. - Fine, I'll stop as long as you promise to help me prepare these decorations. You know, we only have two weeks before Christmas Eve, so pick a pile. - Okay, (upbeat music) * A Christmas city is big and beautiful * * Bright lights everywhere. * Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. * A place where you can meet St. Nick * * So join our journey there * * A Christmas city is a magical site. * * No other place compares * * The smell of pine trees and crackling fires * * Christmas is in the air * * Gifts for all, the reindeer's racing * * Snowmen come to life. * * Christmas trees that are twice the size * - Hi, good morning. (gentle music) (gentle music continues) (gentle music continues) (gentle music continues) - You know, most people would think it's creepy to discover a stranger taking photos of them. - Sorry, it's kind of a reflex for me when I see a beautiful shot. - Oh, you think I'm beautiful? - No, no, well, no, I mean the composition, this scenery, it's... I'm trying to think of an adjective that isn't weird. - I'm kidding, I know what you meant. - Well, thank you for letting me die of embarrassment. - May I see it, this beautiful photo of me? - Sure. - Wow, you're right. I look really good here. - Okay, you've had your fun. - Seriously though, it's a good picture. Could you text it to me? - Is this your clever way of trying to get my phone number? - I'd like to think I could be more clever than that, and I don't think it's too much to ask seeing as how I am the person in the photo. - Good point. Go ahead, text away. So are you meeting someone? - Yeah, just admiring the photographs while I waited. - Thank you. - That's yours too? - It is, I'm a photographer here. - Hmm. - Ah, there he is. Charles Wells, editor in chief, you must be the new writer. - Henry, excited to be here. - Glad to see you starting to get to know your colleagues. Morning, Liv. - Morning, Charles. - Henry's joining us from The Bangkok Post, he's one of their top feature writers. Shall we Chat? - Lead the Way. Liv, it was interesting meeting you. - You as well. We'll have an anxiety spiral about it later tonight. (upbeat music) - Have a seat. Oh, I know this is a lot to take in on your first day, and I promise I'm not trying to scare you off, but we do move pretty quickly around here. - Believe me, things were no different at The Post. I'm happy to hit the ground running. - I'm very glad to hear you say that because you'll soon find that the Christmas edition here at The Chronicle is one of the biggest of the year. We're always on the lookout for a new story to tell, and I think this being your first Christmas in America, that you'll have a very fresh perspective. Now, I'm meeting with the writers tomorrow to go over our current Christmas articles, love to have some ideas from you. - Definitely, I'll get started putting those together immediately. - Excellent, looking forward to it. And welcome to The Chronicle, Henry. - Great to be here. (upbeat music) (upbeat music continues) (camera clicks) - Where have you been? - Relax, I'm like 10 minutes late, that's pretty good for me. - You'd think with all the money you're saving, living at mom and dad's, you could afford some real clothes. - Hey, hey, this style, okay. And with all the money I'm saving on rent, I'll be able to afford my own place in the city by the time I'm 45. You sure you don't wanna move back in? - Oh, as much as I love you all, I'd much rather preserve my sanity. You know that guy? - Yeah, he just started at The Chronicle today, Henry something. I don't know. - Yo, Henry. - Oh, hey, Liv. And? - Andrew, my brother. - Hi. - You need some help? You look kind of lost. - Yeah, actually I'm looking for this restaurant, Mai Pen Rai. - Well that place is great. They got this coconut pudding, they literally make it at the table. You should ask for my friend Ricky, he'll hook you up. - Thanks, I'm actually going there for a story. Charles wants more ideas for the Christmas edition of the paper. I hear this restaurant's created this interesting menu for the holidays, blending traditional Thai dishes with Christmas flavors. - If you are looking for Christmas story, we got you... What's that for? - Andrew, why did you tell Henry how to get to the restaurant? - Fine, if you'll stop hitting me. Around the corner is a laundromat, next to the front door is a staircase, go up and you are in the entrance of an art gallery. Head inside and in the back next to an exhibit, is Mai Pen Rai. If there are any problems, just text me. - You are the most helpful person I've met here so far. - You really are new here, aren't you? - I better get going, story meeting's tomorrow, and I've got a lot of ground to cover. - Well, good luck and feel free to bring us back some spring rolls. - Ow. You're gonna tell me what I did to deserve that? You know I bruise like a peach. - You almost mentioned mom and dad's party. - Right. Do people at work still not know how Changtastic you are? - I just don't wanna be associated with this over the top extravaganza. I'm trying to make a name for myself. - Oh, so now Chang is not a good enough name? - They're like a bajillion Changs, I wanna be my own person. - And do you know who that is? - Yes, Liv Rose, celebrated photographer, and all around icon. - I'm not calling you that. - Come on, lunch is on me. - Okay, Liv Chang. (upbeat music) - [Ivy] Liv. - Mom, I just went grocery shopping. - Just a few small items. - Oh, sure it is. And you know, maybe a text before you stop by would be nice. - I'm sorry, I thought you carrying for nine months and then raising you for the next 18 years would entitle me to an occasional visit. - Seriously? - Don't look at me. Last thing I wanted to do tonight is carry a tree up three flights of stairs. - What, you didn't have a Christmas tree, you're welcome. - Mom, I know you mean well, but this is all too much. - Okay, fine, fine, I will return whatever you don't want. But the Christmas tree stays. - Aww, you have no ornaments? - No, no, okay, no ornaments, this circus is over. - But I got that boring, generic kind like you like. - I gotta go anyways, I promised Henry I'd meet him for dinner. - What? Why? - Who is Henry? - He's a new coworker. Why are you meeting Henry for dinner? - He seems cool, plus he's new in town, and doesn't have any friends. It's called being nice, you should try it. - Oh, you're such a good boy. - Well, I trust you won't mention anything you shouldn't. - Yeah, yeah, don't worry. Bye Mom. - What? - So this Henry, tell me about him. - Mom, just because a man exists does not mean I have to date him. - Tell that to my non-existent grandchildren. Fine, we'll just decorate your tree. - Okay, but we're using my decorations. - Hmm. - Okay, I think we have enough gold. Where are the rest of your ornaments? - Oh, that's it. What, don't you think it looks beautiful? - I feel like I'm in a fancy forest. You know, you used to like all the fun decorations we had at home. - Well, what can I say? People change, tastes evolve. I'm a grownup now. - See, now this frame, this is what I'm talking about. It has color, it has joy, I love it. - That's because you bought it. Come on, time for the final touch. - [Ivy] All right. (upbeat music) - So, what do we think? - Fine. It's pretty. And if this pretty boring tree makes you happy, then who am I to judge? (upbeat music) - [Charles] Liv, get in here. - Hi Charles, do you need me? - Yes, Henry pitched this fantastic idea to me, and you sprang to mind. Please sit. Come on, Henry, fill her in. - Sure. I was just telling Charles about this Chinese Christmas party I heard about. Apparently it's huge. - Oh, is this a local party? - Yeah, up in Knob Hill. - And you mentioned you thought of me when Henry pitched this? - I've seen your Christmas in San Francisco series. That's great stuff. - Oh, thank you, yeah. - Besides, don't you live nearby there? I mean, you must have seen it over the years, it's a big party. - Yes, I have seen it. I'm not sure it's the right assignment for us. I mean, I just think we can go bigger than a neighborhood Christmas party. Right? - I don't know, the way the Changs described it to me, it seems like it has a pretty big impact. - You met them? What, what did they say? - They loved the idea and they seemed really nice. I didn't have a chance to chat to them further, I wanted to make sure they were okay with the story before I pitched it to Charles. - You know Liv, if you don't wanna do this piece with Henry, that's fine, I just thought it was time to give you a cover story. - Wait, you wanna make this a cover story? - Well, I'm considering it. It'd be great for your career, not to mention a huge splash for Henry, his first article here on the front page. But I can always assign it to someone else. I just thought you'd be interested since you seem to have an eye for that Christmas magic. - Well, how could I say no? - Looks like we're all gonna be having a Changtastic Christmas. (everyone laughs) (phone rings) - Hello. - [Liv] Good morning, traitor. - What? - Did you have fun at your dinner with Henry last night? Mention any family secrets you were explicitly told not to discuss? - No, you barely even came up. - Then how come Henry pitched my boss a story about our party? - I don't know, he's a journalist, isn't that his job? - Fine, but if I find out you did this, I will destroy you. It's just a my internet provider, you know? What am I gonna do? I have to kill this article somehow. On the other hand, it could be my first front page photo. - You have to stop being so tight about it and realize it's just a party you're in, nobody cares you're related to it. - I care, sorry, sorry. I'm just, I'm stressed. Maybe it won't be so bad. Maybe I can just spin this and keep my name out of it. - [Andrew] Good luck with that, gotta go. (gentle music) (gentle music continues) - Huh, reminds me of home. - Do you have a year round Christmas Cafe in Bangkok too? - No. But the Butterfly Pea Milk, my grandma makes it during summers. - I've never had it. I'm usually a classic hot chocolate kind of gal. - Oh, you'll have to try it then, it's the best. - I'm sure it's just like home. So where exactly is home? You're from Bangkok, but you have a South African accent. - I'm impressed, that's not an easy accent to pin down. Yeah, I'm kind of from everywhere. I grew up in South Africa, but my family moved around for a bit. My father worked as an ambassador. We ended up in Bangkok to be closer to my grandmother and my mom's side of the family. I'd say that's where home is for me. Home is where the family is, right? - I guess. - Two snowy Butterfly Pea Milk Bobas please. Oh, my treat. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Thanks. - So Liv Rose. Why photography? - I've just always liked to see the beauty in the ordinary. So much happens around us, especially in a city like this. Most people just walk by without ever noticing something incredible right in front of them. - I get that. It's the same for me in journalism. There are stories everywhere if you take the time to look. - True. Though, some stories are best left untold. - Two Butterfly Pea Milk Bobas. - Looks good. Let's grab a seat. - Cheers. - Hey, this is good. - That popping boba is a fun twist. - Oh, are you one of those guys who takes pictures of everything he eats? - It's for my family. My grandma will get a kick out of this. You don't want to take one too? I saw your feed the other day, it'd they go great with your Christmas in San Francisco series. - You looked me up. I didn't realize you were so obsessed with me. - Classic deflection, that won't work on me. Talking to people is my job. - I don't post selfies. Liv Rose stays strictly behind the camera. - Why not? The fans would love it. A chance to see the real you. - Don't we have a story to cover? - Right? How about we dive right in and interview the Changs right now? - Like right now? - Why not? I'm sure there'll be some great photo opportunities unless you want me to do it myself. - Okay, sure. But first I think we can make one quick pit stop. - Sure. (upbeat music) (upbeat music) (upbeat music continues) - Hi. - So what's so important about this place that we have to see it before meeting with the Changs? - Well, one of the big draws behind the party is the larger than life decorations. And the woman behind the mall, Mrs. Lin, there's no Changtastic Christmas party without her contributions. - For someone who doesn't care for the party, you sure have some helpful info. - Everyone in China Town knows Mrs. Lin. Her English isn't great though, so I'll take the lead and talk to her in Cantonese. - Sure. (gentle music) (gentle music continues) (speaking foreign language) Why don't you take a look around? I'll make sure she has time to chat. - I can't believe remember the last time I heard you speak Cantonese. - Oh, well my friend is trying to learn. I wanna immerse him. - You're teaching him? Your Cantonese is terrible. (speaking foreign language) (speaking foreign language) (speaking foreign language) - And could you possibly not mention that I'm a Chang? - What, Liv, you're not making sense. (speaking foreign language) (upbeat music) - Can you ask her about her inspiration for the decorations and how she came to know the Changs? - Of course, I have it handled. - Huh? - You know Mrs. Lin was one of the original attendees at the party. (speaking foreign language) (speaking foreign language) - You should have Liv introduce you to the Changs, they're not far. - Oh, so you know them? - Of course, she's their- - Neighbor, neighbor basically. In fact, we should go to their house now. Mrs. Lin, could you please email us all of the information like we discussed? - What? - Great, perfect. Come on, Henry. (speaking foreign language) - So you can speak Cantonese. - And you can speak English. - Just one quick question, Liv's last name is Chang, isn't it? She's their daughter. - Don't mind her strangeness, she hasn't had a boyfriend in a while. - Thanks again, Mrs. Lin, you've been very helpful. (speaking foreign language) - Hi Andrew, it's me. I need you to get mom and dad out of the house now. I don't have time to explain, just do it, please. Everything okay in there? - Yep, just admiring her decorations. Should we head to the Chang's? - Sure. (upbeat music) Well, guess they're not home, we'll have to come back tomorrow. - Well, let's give it a minute. Hey, do they have kids? Maybe they live nearby. - I'm just gonna take some photos of the exterior. - We could interview some of the neighbors, kill some time until they get back. - We could do that, but what if they're out all night? How about I treat you to one of my own Christmas traditions? It's not like we're gonna be making any headway without them here anyway. We could come back tomorrow. - I suppose you're right. We won't be making any progress until we get past this roadblock. What did you have in mind? (upbeat music) So this is one of your favorite things to do during Christmas, take a boat ride? - Just wait until you see the city lit up in Christmas lights, it's magical. - You know, I have always wanted to experience a Christmas in America. - It's wonderful, but I think it can be easy to forget the true meaning of Christmas and overdo things. - Kind of like the Changs. - There's something I need to tell you. (boat bell rings) Nevermind, it can wait. * Can you feel it in the air * * Good times are gonna last forever * * Baby, it's a time to share * * Because tonight we're gonna be together * * I'm waiting under the mistletoe * * Won't you let us know * * So long, it feels forever * * Oh baby, let's get together this Christmas * - You don't have to walk me home - Oh, don't worry, I'd love to see more of this city. - I'm sorry, tonight was such a bust with the Changs. Maybe we'll have better luck tomorrow. - I really hope so, I'd love to crack this story. And tonight wasn't a bust, it was magical. - Well, I'm so glad you could see the city from a new perspective. (upbeat festive music) (upbeat festive music continues) Okay, family, what did I tell you about not throwing parties in my apartment? - Hi honey. - Hi sweetheart. We're just filling the place with life. - Mom, please, no Christmas stockings. - What? You have a mantle, it needed stockings. (knocking on the door) - With that attitude, yours will be filled with coal anyways. - Give me that. - [Jack] Henry, good to see you. - Henry. - Henry. - Well, if it isn't the Changs, what a pleasant surprise. Liv, I hope you don't mind, but your neighbor let me up and I forgot to give this back to you. - Henry, I can explain. (gentle music) - I just don't understand why you wouldn't tell him that you are our daughter. - I'm really sorry, I know I should have said something. You were going to find out eventually. - Yeah, I already figured it out. You were so hesitant to this assignment that I assumed you must have some connection to it. And when Mrs. Lin mentioned your parents. - You speak Cantonese? - I spent a year in Guangzhou. - Wait, you didn't tell 'em you're related to us and you didn't want to do this story? - I didn't wanna stop it, I just, I wanna keep my personal and professional lives separate. The story's a big deal. I didn't want people to think I got it because I'm related to it. - I can understand that. - I was gonna tell you before the boat ride, I just, I chickened out. - Romantic boat ride. - I know what it's like to want to be taken seriously for your work. I mean, my first story here has the potential to be on the front page, I feel the pressure too. - Wait, wait, wait, we're going to be on the front page? - It's a real possibility. So long as we're all on the same team from here on out. - Of course. - How about tomorrow we all sit down and do a proper interview? - We would love to have you over Henry, right, Liv? - Great. - All right, Changs, let's move out. We'll see y'all tomorrow. - Okay, good night everyone. Ah, ah, ah, not so fast. You had one job, get mom and dad out of the house, what could have possibly possessed you to bring them here? - You think I have any control with those two? And how was I supposed to know you'd bring Henry back here. - He walked me home. - Oh, after your romantic boat ride? - Who are you, Mom? He's my coworker. - Well, whatever you say, and also you should stop stressing about this story so much 'cause it's making you age faster. (grunts) - Love you. - Love you. (upbeat music) - Henry, I just wanted to say sorry again about lying to you. - It's okay, but we are journalists, the truth is what we're all about. We do need to trust each other. - I know, no more secrets. - All right, then we're good. - Oh, just one second. (gentle music) - Do you think we could keep me being a Chang between us for now, I want Charles to hear it from me. - Sure, I can do that. - Thanks. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - I still can't get over these decorations. - Wait 'til you see the inside. (upbeat music) - Welcome. - Hi. - Come on in. - Hey. - Hi. - Here, let me take your coats. - [Liv] Told you the inside was something. - Oh, a paról. - It is. - Are you Filipino? - Half Filipino, half Chinese. - And 100% beautiful. - Okay, let's go into the kitchen. - Henry, my man, what's good? - Andrew, good to see you. - Really, Andrew? - Hey, thanks so much for having me over. I'm looking forward to writing this story, but if I'm honest, I'm even more excited about experiencing a Changtastic Christmas. I can tell it's gonna be everything I've dreamed about. - Oh, you hear that, Liv, he's dreaming above you. - Mom. - I just meant I've always imagined the meaningful ways people celebrate the holidays here. And yours is such a unique take, the fusion of cultures. - Exactly. Fusion is what we're doing with these dumplings too. Today's dish, baked sweet potato dumplings with marshmallow soy sauce glaze. - Hmm. I've never tried anything like that. - Nobody has. - The real secret ingredient, satsumaimo, Japanese sweet potato. - Last year he made chowchow tamales and the year before spanakopita stuffed with Peking duck. They were delicious. - I still dream about those tamales. - I love the passion, which you clearly bring to the party, and I'm sure it extends beyond the food. This really must take a lot of work though. Do you ever cut back a little? Make things simpler? Perhaps take a break? - Excellent question. - I don't do simple, I'm a complicated man. Be sure to get that in the story. - Noted. - Okay, enough yapping. These dumplings won't make themselves. * Dashing through the snow * * In a one-horse open sleigh * * O'er the fields we go * * Laughing all the way * * Bells on bobtails ring * * Making spirits bright * * What fun it is to ride and sing * * A sleighing song tonight * * Jingle bells, jingle bells * * Jingle all the way * * Oh, what fun it is to ride * * In a one-horse open sleigh. * - Liv, why is your dumping so ugly? - Gotta love that motherly affection. - Well do better, Mom gives me plenty of affection. - Because you're a good boy, and look at these beautiful dumplings. - You know what? I think I'll be more useful taking pictures. You guys seem to have this under control. (upbeat music) - Do you want me to take one so you can get in here with the fam? - You know my rule, strictly behind the lens. * Jingle bells, jingle bells * * Jingle all the way * * Oh, what fun it is to ride * * In a one-horse open sleigh, hey * - There you go. - Thanks dad. - Thanks dad. - Here you are. - Thank you, honey. - Hmm. Oh wow, this hot chocolate is amazing. - Yeah, it's like the one thing Liv does well. She makes a huge batch for the party every year. - Look at this, Henry, this is from our first Christmas party 25 years ago, back when it was just a few friends in our living room. - Hey, is this that Mrs. Lin? - [Jack] Yeah, that's right. - We used to repurpose decorations from other holidays. These lanterns were from our friends' wedding. It was Liv's idea to turn them into ornaments. She's so smart. Very smart. Very single. - Mom, seriously. I'm sorry, please, ignore this woman. - Don't worry, my mom does this to me all the time. Makes me miss her. This is really wonderful Mr. and Mrs. Chang. I'd love to help out as I keep working on the story, is there anything else I could do? - How about you and Liv deliver the invitations for us? - Hey, that's our job. I mean, it would be a big help. - Jack and I usually do it together, but it would be nice if you could take it over for us this year. - Okay, great. Oh, what happened here? - Oh, that's the year Liv became too cool for a Changtastic Christmas. - Just your average moody teenager. - You know, when Liv was little, she used to get so excited. She would put on a performance of "Oh Holy Night" in Cantonese. It was the crown jewel of the whole party. And now all we can get her to do is be the party photographer. - Well, that's an important job. - Thank you, Henry. - That's also very convenient, that way you don't have to be in the photos. - Hah. - Okay. Don't you have any more questions for my parents? - Could you tell me a bit more about the history of the party? - Oh, settle in, we've got all night. (upbeat music) (upbeat music) - I know you're a thorough journalist, but you don't have to keep helping out with the party. - Oh, I don't mind, it's nice. Feels like I'm helping out my own family. Plus, they're good people. - Yeah, they are. But they can also be set in their ways. In sixth grade, I looked like a mushroom because my mom insisted on cutting my hair herself. - I know, I saw the photos. - Envelope, please. - It's pretty cool that Andrew designs these every year. - Yeah, he's pretty talented. But don't tell him I said anything. Merry Christmas Mrs. Chen. Bye. - There are a lot of these. - Yeah, tell me about it. All of the guests return these stuffed with donations and personal messages, and then they're all attached to a money tree at the party where a random envelope is selected, whoever it is gets to present all of the money collected to the community fund, which supports afterschool clubs, tutoring, music, sports. Hey Liv. - Hi Mrs. Mendez. - Fancy seeing you here. - Thank you. Here you go. - Thank you. Any intel on your dad's dish for this year? - Oh, sorry, my lips are sealed. Okay, well see you at the party. - Bye. - You seem to know your neighbors pretty well. - Yeah, it's a tight-knit community. - It's great. Even in a big city, you can still experience the warmth of a close neighborhood. - I don't know, I've always been uncomfortable with how much everyone knows my business. - This party seems pretty great, I don't understand why you're so resistant to it. - I know you don't. Fortunately, this story isn't about me, so you don't need to worry about it. * We wish you Merry Christmas. * * We wish you Merry Christmas. * * We wish you Merry Christmas. * * And a happy new Year. * * Good tidings we bring to you and your king * - After we're done delivering all of these, do you mind if we stop by Mrs. Lin's store again? I want to get something for your parents for letting me be part of the full Changtastic experience. - That's very sweet. (upbeat music) - I hope they like it. - I'm sure they'll love it. - Did you know that all the China Towns around the world have a similar look because of this China Town? - No, I didn't. - After the 1906 earthquake, a group of Chinese Americans hired non-Chinese planners to rebuild and create a family friendly hub for tourism. What they ended up with was something not quite Chinese, but not quite American. - How do you know all of this? - I'm a journalist, I did my research. Don't they teach this in school? - No, actually they don't. But there is one place I know a little something about. (upbeat music) Welcome to the oldest cathedral in California. It was where my great grandparents learned English way back when and my mom forced us to go to Saturday Chinese school. (gentle music) (gentle music continues) It's beautiful in here, isn't it? - It really is. (gentle music) (gentle music continues) - This church has been a symbol of East meets West for over a century. The stone foundation was cut and made to order in China, and the brick came from New England. It was also the first Chinese mission. - Hello. - Hi. - Welcome to Old St. Mary's. Don't forget to light a candle and say a Christmas prayer. - I used to love coming to church with my family to light candles, especially at Christmas. Every candle here is someone's prayers. Just imagine if each prayer is answered, how much good is happening in the world? Should we light some of our own? - Sure. (gentle music) (gentle music continues) (gentle music continues) (gentle music continues) (gentle music continues) - What? - I was just thinking how this was a really nice way to end the day. Thanks for sharing it with me. - My pleasure. And thank you for teaching me some history about my own city. (gentle music) (upbeat music) - It's so nice of your parents to have me over for dinner. I'm getting more than a story, they've really helped me feel at home here. - They're great at that, aren't they? (speaking foreign language) - Did she just say the cilantro looks sad? - She sure did. Mom likes to haggle here because she feels like she's connecting to her roots. But no one haggles in China Town, it's so embarrassing. (speaking foreign language) Go ahead and taste it, they're so fresh and fragrant. The tomatoes are, they're, ugly. - Ugly. - Yep, called it. (speaking foreign language) Well, if you are really not happy, then I'll make a second dish for the party, and go back to Chinese school, I can barely understand you. (laughing) - Oh. Our next interviewee is ready. - Oh, you don't wanna see my mom buy beef? Mrs. Fung's husband is the butcher, and the show always reaches a climax here. (speaking foreign language) (upbeat music) - The party means so much to what we're doing here. - It has that much of an impact? - Oh yeah, without the party,. we wouldn't have this equipment or half the programs we have going on. As far as I'm concerned, the Changs are community heroes. - They seem like very inspiring people. - [Eric] I certainly think so. - What do you think drives them to give back to the community like this? - Oh, I think Liv can answer that better than me. But there was a year when a few families were having difficulty affording the extracurricular programs. Liv didn't want her friends feeling left out, so she's the one that started giving back. - So the red envelopes were your idea? - The giving back part was, the envelopes and money tree were my parents'. - You'd never imagined that. - I didn't think it was relevant. - To our story it's all relevant. - I like to stay behind the camera, remember? Anyway, I've got what I need here, how we looking? Should we head back to the office? - Yeah, I think I'm good here. Great. Thanks so much. - Of course, see you at the party. - Bye Liv. - Bye. (upbeat music) (upbeat music continues) - That must be a good one. - Oh, it's just a silly photo for another piece I'm working on. How's our story coming? - I've got a pretty solid rough draft. Of course, we still have to actually attend the party, but the bulk of it is there. You know, Liv, we've got a chance to make the front page here, but that might not happen if you hold that on us. - Henry, my role in the party is not important to the story. - You don't know that, what if it is the story? - It's not. Look, I know this is about my family, but I would still like to maintain some boundary between my personal and professional lives. - Okay. I don't wanna put you in an uncomfortable position. Hopefully Andrew isn't too upset he isn't named specifically. - Thanks, Henry, seriously. - Don't mention it. And we're off. Hopefully Charles likes what we have so far. You should probably talk to him though. The longer you wait, the worse it's going to get. - I know. (gentle music) - Any interest in going out to celebrate? * Dashing through the snow * * In a one horse open sleigh * * O'er the fields we go * - I almost feel guilty for how much fun I'm having on my first assignment in San Francisco. Here's to a very merry Christmas and to great teamwork. - I'll cheers to that. - Wow, I've never had an eggnog martini before, but that is surprisingly good. - It might actually give snowy Butterfly Pee Milk a run for its money. You know, Henry, we've only been talking about my family this whole time and I know nothing about yours. What about you? Do you have a big, loud family too? - I was the eldest of five, so it was pure chaos growing up. - You must miss them. - I really do. My family doesn't really celebrate Christmas, so I wasn't expecting the holidays to make me so homesick. - If it helps. I'm sure my parents would be happy to make you an honorary Chang for Christmas. - It actually does help. * O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree * * How lovely are thy branches * - What do you say? Should we get out there and dance? - No, no, no, no, no way. And besides, I have two left feet. - Come on, where there's music, there's dancing. It'll be fun. * O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree * * How lovely are thy branches * * O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree * * How lovely are thy branches * * Deck the halls with boughs of holly * * 'Tis the season to be jolly * * Fa la la la la, la la la la * * Follow me in merry measure * * Fa la la la la, la la la la * * As we sing of Yuletide treasure * * Fa la la la la, la la la la * - Wow, my goodness, oh my goodness, that was amazing. Now I know why your parents are so bummed you don't sing up the parties anymore. - I can't believe I just did that. Now's probably a good time to call it, I don't wanna die of embarrassment. - Yeah, you look like you're having fun. How about a stroll to top of the evening? I'll walk you home. - Sure. - I had a really good time tonight. - Me too. Thanks for pushing me outside of my comfort zone. - Anytime. Thanks for letting me unload about my family back home. - Of course, I'm sure they miss you just as much as you miss them. I'll bet they're even bragging to anyone who will listen about their brilliant journalist son and his new life in America. - Yeah, maybe. Unless I don't cut it out here. I mean, don't get me wrong, The Bangkok Post is great and all, but this is the San Francisco Chronicle. I mean, that's a big deal. - Imposture syndrome, I know it well. (gentle music) Henry, Charles wouldn't have taken a chance on you if he didn't think you were great. I mean, front page potential, and from what I've seen, you're thorough, compassionate, good with people, you care. And once this article comes out, everyone is gonna see that. (gentle music) Oh no. - Oh, well look at that. - I can't believe it, this has my mom written all over it. I mean, there might as well be a sign that says, "My daughter lives here, somebody kiss her." It's too much. - She sure does go the extra mile. Well, I guess I should probably get home. - Yeah, yes, totally. Thanks, I'll see you at work tomorrow. - Of course, sounds good. - Okay. (gentle music) (upbeat music) - Morning, Liv. - Oh hey, Henry, morning. - Hey, I got you something, a little memento from last night. - That's very funny. - Snagged it on my way to work this morning, figured I'd eliminate the threat of any unwanted affection. - Well, it's the nicest gift I've ever received. - Good, you're both here, in my office. There's some good stuff here. We got Christmas and fun and community and spirit and so on and so on. But it's not there, you know, something's missing. We gotta dig deeper into the Chang family to get to the heart of the story. - Yeah, I know. I may have held back on some of those details. - Well put them in there, the reader wants a personal connection. - Actually, there's something I need to confess. The thing is, Henry held back because I asked him to. - You asked him to? Well, why exactly did you do that? - Wow, well, that didn't go as well as I'd hoped. I don't think I've seen Charles that disappointed before. Surprised he didn't take me off the story. - He didn't take you off because you are great at your job. He knows this is complicated and that it took guts coming clean. I'm proud of you. (phone rings) - Oh, Henry, I gotta run, I have to go pick up the red envelopes. - I'll come with you. - It's okay, I'll be quick, and you're busy with the story, you have three days to rewrite it. - This is the story. I'm not gonna find it by sitting behind a computer. - Let's roll. - Thank you, Mrs. Chen. - So that was the last one. - Thanks for being my pack mule. - My pleasure. - So you ready to lug that bag back to my parents? - Sure. But instead of walking, there's something I've been wanting to do since I got here, and now would be the perfect opportunity. (upbeat music) - Henry, careful, you're being such a tourist. - I basically am a tourist. Come on, join me, live a little. - Sir, sit down please. - Henry, you're gonna get us kicked off. - Don't tell me you've lived here all your life and you've never hung off the side of a cable car? - I definitely have not. - I'm gonna tell you this is a friend, I think your brother's right, you need to stop worrying so much about what other people think of you. - Okay, friend. But I think that there's a difference between that and acting like a civilized member of society. And please don't side with Andrew. - I don't know, I think he's got a point. Of course, if you wanna prove me wrong. (upbeat music) - Merry Christmas San Francisco. - Merry Christmas San Francisco. - You two hooligans are off at the next stop. - Hooligans. Henry, where did the bag go? Excuse me, have you seen where our bag went? Did anyone know where our bag went? (gentle music) (somber music) (somber music continues) Must have searched a 10 block radius and nothing. What am I gonna do? My parents are gonna kill me. - Oh perfect timing. Henry, I hope you brought your appetite. What's wrong? You lost it, all of it. - That's bad, even for you. - How are we supposed to tell everyone that we lost all their money? - Mr. and Mrs. Chang, this is really my fault. We both took turns carrying the bag, but I should have made sure we still had it. - I knew we shouldn't let her do it. It's our tradition, Ivy. - I thought it would be nice to pass this on to Liv, to get her to reconnect to the party again. - Why are you always trying to force me to be a part of all of this? You know I don't like being the center of attention like you do, that's why I take the photos. - You don't need you to be the center of attention, we need you to be a part of this family for Christmas. We want you to care just a little about the party, about this family. If you did, maybe this wouldn't have happened. - Care? I think the problem is I've always cared too much. I don't want this family to be a target for ridicule. That's why I had to set some boundaries. - You can't get mad at us for trusting you to handle something so simple. - Simple, this is anything but simple. Why do we have to display envelopes on a tree for everyone to see? You always make everything this big show, and you expect me to be someone I'm not. This party is a circus, and it's embarrassing. - I didn't realize we were such an embarrassment. - Mom, I didn't... - No, ah, no, I understand now. My daughter's ashamed of us. Your father and I will handle this. We'll apologize to everyone at the party, we'll tell them that we lost the money. Don't worry about saving face, in fact, it'll be best if you didn't come. (gentle music) (phone ringing) - Hi. - Good morning. I wanted to see how you're doing. - I'm taking a mental health day. - I hate to bother you, but we still have a story to submit. It's a tight deadline. - Henry, I can't be a part of this story anymore. - Liv. - I'm serious, I've ruined everything. My parents don't even want me at the party and I don't blame them. So for now, I need some time alone, okay. - Okay. - I took some great photos, so just choose your favorites. (gentle music) - Thank you for agreeing to talk with me again, I know it's not the best timing after last night. - We're sorry you had to see that. - We appreciate you caring about our story so much. Hopefully we're still front page worthy. - There's a really special story here, I just wanna make sure I get it right. Is it okay if I set up a camera to make sure I get everything? - Of course. (upbeat music) Well, I hope you're ready to get your hands dirty again. - You know it. Oh, and before I forget, I got something for you too. - Oh, you didn't have to get us anything. - Ah, just a little thank you. - Oh, I love it. - Thank you. - All right, well let's start putting together some goody bags. - Okay, there's a whole system here, Henry, so follow along closely. First off, we have these little jars of Liv's special hot chocolate. And despite what happened last night, I have to admit it's delicious. So into the bag it goes. Next, we have peppermint tea, some candy, and Liz's special Christmas fortune cookies. - Liv's done a lot this year. - I know she acts like she's too sophisticated for our party, but she does have a good heart. - Maybe it's because we're her parents, but we always want everyone to know how amazing she is. - Even when we're mad at her. (upbeat music) * Father Christmas * * I'm writing to you for forgiveness * * Walking alone in the stillness * * Wishing it wasn't this way * * On this holiday * * Snow is falling * * Won't you put hope in the stocking * * I'll take some joy if you got it * * Is there something for this pain * * Packed up in your sleigh * - Welcome back. - You remember me? - Of course. You came in with that tall, handsome man. How are you? - Honestly not great. I kind of ruined Christmas for my family, an entire neighborhood, actually. - I'm sure it's not that bad. - Oh no, it is. I didn't just ruin a party. I lost thousands of dollars intended for the kids in our neighborhood. I called my parents an embarrassment, even though the entire community loves them. And now they're gonna let everybody down because of me. And that tall, handsome man, well, I basically abandoned him while he tries to pick up the pieces of the disaster I've caused. - Oh, I see. May I? This party would it happen to be the big Christmas soirée that happens a few blocks from here? - You know about it? - Well, I'm usually in the cathedral when it happens, but I hear it's a real joy. It's strange how a time of year so filled with joy and hope can also be the cause of heartache. In the grand scheme of things, I believe Christmas symbolizes a time of communities coming together and refuge for those who need it, even when it's dark. Follow me dear. Fortunately, darkness is easy to drive away. Sometimes we just need a little help from our neighbors. That's why sharing our light is so important. You never know who else around you might need it. - Are you an angel? - Oh no, I've just lived a long life, but I am a neighbor if you need one. - Thanks. (gentle music) (gentle music continues) (gentle music continues) - We got these made special for the 25th anniversary. - Hey, stuff and talk you guys, I'm not gonna fill all these bags myself. - This is from the 20th anniversary, the year Santa showed it up to help me hand out my sesame candy canes, didn't go over so well. - I am curious though, why infuse all the Chinese elements into your Christmas party? - Chinese and Christmas traditions just go together. I mean, red and green are lucky colors, so our decorations were already made for Christmas. - Jack and I just wanted to reconnect with our roots, you know, and share that Asian family joy with our children and our community. - It's also why we used to have Liv sing at the party. We wanted her to feel proud of her heritage and feel the love and strength for the community that loves her. You should have seen how moved the Chinese families were when they saw a little Liv in their cheongsam, singing a Christmas tune in Cantonese. They loved it, everybody loved it. - Yeah, I know, we can be a little over the top. Okay, a lot over the top. - We just like to put our own spin on everything, but that's what being Chinese American is. It's the best of both worlds and a hot pot mess. (upbeat music) (upbeat music continues) - Merry Christmas to you. Merry Christmas. - Writer's block? - Welcome back, how was your mental health day? - Very productive actually, thank you for sending me the interview, it was exactly what I needed to hear. - I'm glad. - I think I was so caught up in how the party was affecting me all these years, I completely lost sight of the incredible people who put it on. - They really are something. - I wanna apologize for everything that's happened. I know I've made a mess out of things. I let my own baggage almost derail the story. I hid the truth of who I am from you and from Charles, which could have scrapped your first assignment. I'm done running from that person now. - I'm happy to hear it. - And I think I know a way to raise back the donations I lost. - You do? What do you have in mind? - Let's consult an expert first. (upbeat music) There he is. - This is your expert? - An expert in being Changtastic. - What up least favorite child? - Oh, I'm glad to see you too. - Henry. - Hey. - So what's up? - I wanted to tell you that you were both right. I spend way too much time caring about what other people think. - Called it. - And you both deserve the full truth as to why I run from Liv Chang and became just Liv Rose. - Wow, this is serious. - This whole mess started in seventh grade, the last year I sang at the party, and it turned out to be the most embarrassing moment in my life. I actually liked singing for everyone, and I loved the red cheongsam grandma bought me, I was so excited to show it off. So I invited a few girls from my class. They recorded me and sent it out to everyone at school. So for the rest of junior high, all the kids would make fun of me, singing to me in a Chinese accent. - Liv, that's awful. - Looking back, I wish I didn't give into a bunch of basic bullies, but after that, I wasn't really myself anymore. I was trying to blend in, but also feeling guilty for trying to distance myself from everything Chinese. I'm really not embarrassed of our family or of the party, I'm embarrassed of myself, but I'm not even sure if I know who myself is anymore. - You know you don't have to be one thing or another. You can be everything you are, artist, amateur baker, annoying sister. You know what it helps me out, knowing that hater's gonna hate, but you, mom and dad always got my back, no matter what. - Thank you for having my back, both of you. (gentle music) - I think other people should hear this. I'm sure you're not the only one who has felt this way. - Well, that's why I brought you both here today. It's time to show everyone who I am, all of me. I just hope they still like me once they get to know me. - They'll love you. - Yeah, just be yourself, but you know, less weird. - Okay. - Hi everyone, I'm coming to you live because there's something important I have to get off my chest. Most of you know me as Liv Rose, the photographer. But there's a part of me I've avoided for a very long time. My name, my full name is Liv Rose Chang. And my family and my community need your help. (triumphant music) (upbeat music) (upbeat music continues) - Whoa, this sweater costs 90 bucks. - Why is there a money tree in the backyard? I thought with everything that happened, we weren't gonna have one. - Relax, there's no money in the envelopes. - Then why did you do that? Any minute now I'm gonna have to go out there and tell everyone that there is no money. The tree will still be nice to look at. - It's okay, son, your mom's just a little high strung tonight. You haven't heard from your sister, have you? - I thought you told her not to come. - We did, but that doesn't mean we don't want her here. - Thank you, thank you. - Welcome. - Hi. - Where are you guys? - Mom and dad are flipping out. We're almost there, is everything ready? - I'm just waiting on you. - Hope you're ready for a party you'll never forget. (upbeat music) (upbeat music continues) - Whoa. - Yeah, that's the right word. (upbeat music) (upbeat music continues) (upbeat music continues) (upbeat music continues) - It's about to pop off any second, you really cut it close. - What can I say? I'm a Chang, I have a flare for the dramatic. - Thank you everyone for joining us here tonight to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Changtastic Christmas party. (crowd applauds) - We wanna start by thanking you all for your incredible help, it wouldn't have been possible for this party to have grown and endured without each and every one of you. - This year we have some news we need to share. Normally by this time, we would have a tally of all the donations that we received, and we'd be picking an envelope to see which lucky neighbor gets to announce just how much we get to give back to our community. But unfortunately, this year, that's not the case, because the truth is... - I lost the money. I'm so, so sorry. I was careless. And I think it's because I never truly understood just how important this party is. In fact, I was embarrassed to be associated with it. But with the help of a new friend and the kindness of a neighbor, I finally realized that this party is more than just my parents' outlandish way of celebrating Christmas. It's their way of bringing our community together to celebrate our friendships and remind each other that we have each other to lean on when we need to. Many of you have known me most of my life and have supported our family through our ups and downs. And I know my parents have done the same for you too. And that's something special I want to make up for what I lost and all those years I spent hiding from this big, absurd, over the top, fun, joyous, magical celebration of the best time of the year. I did have to ask for some help though. So I wanna thank all of my followers who watched and reshared my video and donated generously. They made up all of your donations and then some. - Hang on, excuse me, hang on. Hi, I found your money. - You what? - My friends and I saw it fall off the cable car. But by the time we caught up to you, you were gone. I saw your video online, so I finally figured out how to get it to you. - I can't believe this, what? Thank you, what's your Name? - Nora. - Thank you Nora. (everyone applauds) Thank you. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - Does this mean there's twice as many donations as there usually are. - And more. I have one more surprise for you. (singing in foreign language) (singing in foreign language continues) (singing in foreign language continues) (singing in foreign language continues) (singing in foreign language continues) (singing in foreign language continues) (singing in foreign language continues) (singing in foreign language continues) (singing in foreign language continues) (everyone applauds) - That's my daughter Liv, that was... - Incredible. - Mom, dad, I'm so sorry I've been so selfish all these years. - We're just happy to have you back in the Chang fold sweetheart. - I'm speechless, I don't think that's ever happened to me before. - He's a good one, isn't he? - He is. And you'd be very stupid to let him go. - Mom. - If it helps, pretend we hate him, it'll be an act of rebellion. - Well, I think it's time I start taking your advice. I clearly have a lot to learn from you two. - That seems like it went over pretty well. - I think we're finally starting to understand each other. And I also think you and I make a great team, and I would love to cover more stories together. - I'd like that. And I hope we can keep being friends too. That is, if you're okay with blending your personal and professional lives a little. - I wanna be more than friends. (upbeat music) (upbeat music continues) - So you ready to celebrate? - I almost forgot something. * Oh, oh, oh * (upbeat music) - Say grandchildren. (upbeat music continues) (upbeat music continues) (upbeat music continues) - It's perfect, that Liv Chang is a pretty good photographer. - Come on, I have a gift for you. - Oh. (gentle music) - Don't tell my mom, or she'll think she's the reason for this story too. Merry Christmas Henry. - Merry Christmas Liv. - Okay to come in? - We've got leftovers. - You know I can't stop these two. - What took you guys so long, come in. - Sorry. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas.
