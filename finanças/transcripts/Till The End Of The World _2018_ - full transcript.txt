Credits Come on man. One, two, three, say ""Cash. Cash. Let's take a selfie, too. Come on. Get closer. One, two, three, Cash! Jing Ruyi. Interesting collections of labels. They are collected from different stations. So many stations, a real veteran of Antarctica! What do you study? - Aeronautics. - The things in the sky? I study things that happen on the ground. A wedding ceremony in the Antarctic. [Let's get married in Antarctica] This is my brand ambassador, Chubby. The day after tomorrow, in Qianjin Station, there will be the corporation signing ceremony through a live-stream satellite. At the same time, the public offering of my company, Forever Wedding Service will also be announced. It's me, Wu Fuchun. Call me "Fortune." - Natasha. Nice to meet you. - Na... Sister Na! My project has passed astrict comprehensive, environmental evaluation. So many people in the wedding business have their eyes on Antarctica, but I am the only one who could cut the deal. See! It's a world full of ice and snow, 14 million square kilometers of purity, and spotlessness. What will it be really good for? Wedding vows! This place has its way of turning any mushy promises into a pure magical vow. With two penguins as best man and bridesmaid, you don't even have to worry about a tuxedo and gown. You two hit the jackpot today. You got a free flight. This flight is chartered by me. Other flights have all been canceled, right? Penguins! Chubby, I saw your bros! Ruyi, is this guy trying to start up a wedding ceremony business in the Antarctic? One step on the Antarctica lichen by guys like him means hundreds of years to rehabilitation. Sounds like their next goal is going to be Mars. That is our Chinese nouveau riche. Oh, nouveau riche. 984, 984.! A storm is forming ahead of you. It's a big boy. This is 984. I‘ve got it from my radar. Tower, 984 requests 30 miles left of the route. Received 984, be careful. What is wrong with you?! What is wrong with you! I didn't mean to! Buckle your seatbelt! 984, 984! The storm is too strong! An immediate return is strongly recommended! Repeat, return immediately! Roger, returning now! Attention, we need to climb immediately! What is going on? The storm is getting severe. It's too fast! What did he just say? 984, 984, do you copy? Do you copy? You are off my radar. Report your position immediately! 984! 984! Severe icing condition on the fuselage! Losing control! Mayday! Mayday! Mayday! 984, force landing, request all assistance! Are you qualified or not?! [Till the End of the World] Help! Help us. Help me. Pull out your leg. Pull harder! Come back! Help me. Hurry! - My boot! - What?! My boot is stuck! There's no cell signal here. The black box! Shouldn't there be a black box on the plane? The average depth of the sea is over 3,000 meters here. The black box won't be able to send its signal out. Someone is going to rescue us, right? What time is it? 10:00 p.m. According to the flight schedule, it's impossible for us to land on the sea. We are severely off course. No one will know our location. I can't find anything useful here. What are all these for? All for my study of the aurora. Au… what? We can't leave her here… But she's dead. It's dark and cold at the bottom of the sea. Wait! Listen... When the wind stops, it's pure silence here. Sounds great. We need to leave! A snowstorm is coming! We can't keep going! Or else we will definitely get lost! What? The antarctic blizzard wind is forming! We have no time to waste. We must dig a hole right here right now! - Dig what?! - Dig a hole! Here you go! Hurry up! The temperature keeps dropping. - You need to be faster! - I am being f*cking faster! Excuse me. I can draw a huge SOS in the snowfield. For who to see? Maybe I can get a signal on one of those hills? What if? Can you stop saying nonsense? Where are we? Antarctica. You will get no signal no matter how high you climb. You refuted all my suggestions. What can we do, then? Stay here and wait for death? We were not supposed to take off today. If it weren't for you charting a plane to rush things, no one would be dead. I didn't f*cking ask you to get on board! F*cking Antarctica, what a big deal? I am not dying here! Why are you f*cking doing this to me now? I've been working my ass off for all these years! Finally, my company is going public, tomorrow! No signal, but I found a hub. Abandoned though. Let's go. There are several hills waiting ahead. It's already midnight now. Why is it still light? This is the polar day. - There will be no night at all. - This place sucks. How far is it? One hill left. I can't take it anymore. The broken bone keeps jabbing my flesh. I can't bear it anymore! Get up! - Get up! - No. Now what? My tibia is fractured. We need to set the broken bone. Oh. Wait, setting a bone? How can I do that? You must be kidding. If we don't do it now, it will lead to mass muscular necrosis, followed by internal organ failure. I will die. No. I will also need to lie in this bed for a long time, enough to get myself bedsores. I have to take off my pants. Wait. I can't do it by myself. Ready? Hang in there! Hey, wake up! What's next? F*ck. What now? Use your words. What is it? I need to urinate. Nobody will know. Salmon, beef, soybean, a pile of Russian cans. Holy sh*t, braised bamboo shoots and canned mackerels. This is from Shanghai. Date? April 24th, 1998. Jing Ruyi, we have rice. Exclusive offer for Chinese Antarctic Expedition. 104 cans, a bag of rice and half a bottle of liquor. Based on the dates printed on these cans, the last time people stopped by might be two years ago. Check this out. A real antique. 1992. Made in Australia. Wu Fuchun, maybe we are only 20 kilometers away from the Chinese Aurora Station. What? Check this out. Xue Long's first port of call is Fremantle in Australia, where it loads the supplies. Then it sails through the Westerlies, eventually stopping at the Aurora Station. It must be the Chinese expedition team, which left these Australian cans and Chinese rice. The Russian Red Star Station is near the Aurora Station. This explains why there are these Russian cans. There is an abandoned observation station about 20 kilometers away from Aurora station. This must be it. We are saved. I only know the distance, but not the direction. It's gonna be like looking for a needle in a haystack in such a huge white open field. Then go look for it! How can you give up before trying? There are only North, South, East, West, four directions. I'll go and find it. This type of 2 kilowatt generator consumes over 1 liter of diesel per hour. Even if it only operates 8 hours a day, 800 liters of diesel can only keep it running for approximately 75 days. About 75 days later, the polar night will arrive. Without fuel to generate heat, we will freeze to death. Then I will find the Aurora station before 75 days! I don't believe that we won't find it! I'd rather die on the road. It has been three days since the crash. According to the solar orientation I observed back then, we crashed on the west side. Therefore, the ocean lies to the west. So the other three directions you need to search are east, south and north. Okay, I will go look for that needle. You stay here and wait. There are some fruit hard candies in my upper pocket. You keep it. 50 grams of candies provide roughly 300 calories. These may save you in a life-threatening situation. All right. Here. Put some more on when I'm out. We can only use the generator at night. You are such an odd person, coming to the Antarctic dressed in a fur coat and tie. This is not odd, this is a marvel. When my wedding business sets up in Antarctica you will find crowds of grooms coming here with their ties on. Which direction do you plan to start with? The east. The sun rises in the east. The sun rises in the south during the polar day here. Sh*t. How can the sun rise from the south? The sun doesn't set in the polar day. It circles around you above the horizon. Solar altitude is at its maximum at noon, while the sun is right in the north. Then, it moves to the northwest. After that, to the southeast, and solar altitude is decreased. At midnight, the sun is in the south, solar altitude gets to a minimum. It's morning now. The sun is moving towards the southeast. I don't understand all that you're saying. I have this, is it okay? A smart phone's built in compass doesn't work here. The latitude is too high here, - where south and north magnetic pole… - Forget about the south and north magnetic pole. are totally different with the south and north pole in geography! In short, the sun rises in the south in this messed-up place, right? I got it. Chill out. I think you should start with the south, towards the sun. The fortuneteller told me I will get good luck in the north this year. So, I am betting on the north. The north. I'm heading out! Where the heck is the sun? Considering the snow depth outside, your speed is about four kilometers per hour on foot. Keep an eye on your watch. You may walk around 20 kilometers after five hours. If you don't see Aurora Station… Then I will check around just in case. In the clean air, you will have a good view reaching over 10 kilometers. So use your eyes. Don't wander around. - You need to conserve your strength. - Got it. Don't flaunt your superiority. You will need to walk over 40 kilometers a day to make a return journey, which will take you almost 10 hours. You are right-handed, so your right leg is supposed to be stronger than the left one. You think you walk straight, but actually you will go towards the left side. Meanwhile, you are affected by the Coriolis force, which will make the situation worse. That's impossible. I have a great sense of direction. You should learn to maintain the same direction through observing the angle between your body and shadow. Also, engrave all the landmarks in your mind, or you will lose your way back. Such as a hill or a glacier. Excuse me, do you know where the Aurora Station is? This way? Or that way? Don't bother. You take care, bro. This is not funny. I can't take a sh*t with you staring at me. This is some real sh*t. I will leave it all to you. Holy sh*t, that sound, that momentum, it came down with the force of a thunderbolt. I pulled up my pants, and ran like hell, even faster than the avalanche. Icebergs only exist in the sea, which means the sea is on the north. Told you! I should go north! So, tomorrow, go east or south? You should take a rest tomorrow. It's all right. I am good to go. The supplies you bring with you can only support you for two days out there. If you don't make it, neither can I. Don't say that. If you don't come back after two days, then I have to end it all myself. The fortuneteller also told me that, I will die a natural death as a wealthy man surrounded by grandchildren. Tomorrow I will walk towards the east. You stay here and take your rest, there's nothing to worry about when I'm around. But don't lie still all day long. You need to move your butt from time to time. After you set my bone like this, my leg hurts a lot when I move. Well, you have to move it even if it hurts. Otherwise, what will I do if you get bedsores? So the east side is also surrounded by the sea. We are in a peninsula, and Aurora is somewhere in the south of this place. So tomorrow let's divide it into three directions to search, southwest, south and southeast. We can render a detailed searching plan for each direction. OK. Here. Skua bone soup, it's a calcium supplement. - Smells good. - It's so fishy. How about I stick to the cans? Thrift is a virtue. Have a sip. Don't spit it out! Such a waste. I cooked these bones especially for you. You have to eat, you know? You need to replenish calcium. Only with replenishing calcium will you be able to grow... A quick question. Which one tastes better? A seal or a penguin? Eating either one is a violation of the Antarctic Treaty. Antarctic Treaty! I've violated countless treaties in my whole life, but didn't expect the chance to violate this one. I have to remind you, we don't have enough fuel, for well-cooked seal or penguin. We could cook some small fish at best. Those poor cold water fish can only grow a few millimeters every year. A palm-sized fish can be a really old one. You pity the fish? Who is going to take pity on us? Have you fallen asleep yet? No. Then tell me about the Au...ra....something. Do you really want to know about that? No, I don't. But I'm too hungry to fall sleep. In the upper atmosphere, about 100 kilometers above the Earth's surface, high-energy electrons from the solar wind strike atoms or molecules in the upper atmosphere. These excited atoms and molecules return to ground state and the light they emit, is the aurora, also called polar lights. We can see it in the polar night about two months later. By then we will be dead, I've heard that part. There is a legend that says, aurora was a big whale that flew into the sky leaving a giant wave behind. Another legend says that aurora was the soul of a gone girl. How much do you get paid for your hard work? All about money… What else do you love besides money? What's the most valuable thing in the Antarctic? Meteorites. How much are they worth? They are priceless. Neat. Tell me, where can I find them? Uncle Scrooge. How can you be such an old fool? I confess! It was me. It wasn't easy for these fish to live to this age. I see the karma. But they could've also been preyed on by a seal, a skua or a penguin. Isn't that so? It has been two days already. If I die, what will happen to her? Fuchun. Fuchun. Namo Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva. Namo Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva. Ruyi! I am back! I couldn't do it myself. Antarctic fish soup. Try some. I fell into an ice crevasse. Ruyi, let's survive this together, okay? I am going now. If you are tired of waiting or if I can't make it back, at least use up the diesel and finish all the canned food before you die. Ruyi, now I am scared when the wind stops. The only thing left when the wind stops is dead silence. But I am also scared of when the wind blows. When the wind blows, it wipes off all the footsteps behind me. How about you? What are you scared of? Ruyi! Ruyi! Ruyi! Ruyi! Ruyi! Ruyi! Ruyi! Ruyi! Fuchun! Ruyi! Ruyi! Ruyi! Ruyi! - Ruyi! - Fuchun! Fuchun! Fuchun, here, right here! Fuchun. Fuchun. - Fuchun... - Ruyi… I can't see any more. The snow field reflects nearly 95% of the sunlight. You stay outside every day which is almost the same as looking directly at the sun. How long until it gets better? Two to three days. Now it's your turn to take care of me. Fuchun. We have to survive. Stop. Turn left. Turn right. Stop kicking. Here. Slowly. Why are you still standing there? Don't you need a hand? No. You can go out. I'm blind. Out. Walk straight. Turn left. Did you know that ten thousand years ago there were big trees growing on the riverbanks here. 2.5 million years ago, this was a vital land covered by an enormous forest. You can see now? Not very clear… The snowfield really doesn't dazzle any more. What's that saying? With a larger heart (rack), comes a larger stage. We are running out of the cans. I will go fishing. Then walk towards this direction. It should be near this place. Got it? I will be waiting here for you. I'm going! Ruyi, be with me. You will definitely say "Yes", right? That's right, I am a little bit of a male chauvinist. But I mean what I say. Every time, I came back alive. To be honest, you're not bad too. Big eyes, small face. You even know about the things in the sky. Just a little bit too serious. After we go back, I'll take you to the movies and fine dining candlelight dinners every single night. We can have a full out feast. Look at how skinny you are now. Fuchun. You are back. Fuchun! Fuchun! Sister Na. Ruyi's boots don't fit me. Who's there? No one. Was it the wind? It must be the wind. Check again, please. No one is there. I am sure! Maybe you should give her back the boot. I paid her in US dollars! What are you doing? Cooking. Yes, go right into your boiler. Do you like steamed penguin? If you steam it, I will braise you. We are out of soy sauce. Wu Fuchun! Don't you dare! So cute! So yummy. We can't afford to feed it. I can share my food with it. You barely eat as is. Fuchun. Let's give it a name. How about Blacky? Well, I prefer Chubby. It looks exactly like my ambassador Chubby. Okay, then Chubby it is. Chubby. Chubby! Fuchun, you are actually a nice person. What's the point of being nice? Hey! Nice people, will be blessed. Come on! Chubby! Hurry up! Come on! Chubby! How are you? I am fine, and you? Have some of this too. I don't eat expired foods. What's the most valuable thing in the Antarctic? Meteorites. - How much are they worth? - They are priceless. Neat. Tell me, where can I find them? Well, we need to start with the glacier movement. When the moving glacier which is blocked by a mountain begins to melt, the meteorites hidden inside the glacier - will crop out. - Ruyi, we are rich! It seems like a genuine one. Definitely! Absolutely! Take a look at it This looks like a Mars meteorite. Mars! But it looks a little bit different from what I have seen before. Meteorites can't all be the same. Perhaps it's from Mercury? Must be Mercury. - Then it's more precious. - Of course, it is! It's priceless! No kidding! Mercury is really precious. Have you ever had a family heirloom? This can be one. Which way is north? Northwest, the direction of fortune! It should be placed in that place. My precious… Ruyi. Still, it looks odd. Nonsense! Where is it odd? It looks great, made in Mercury. It's a piece of sh*t! What meteorite?! A piece of melting sh*t! I almost ate it back there. I've seen the shits from the penguins, seals and skuas. This one definitely belongs to a f*cking human. From whom? It's been so long, why didn't you tell me. Scurvy is caused by a deficiency in vitamin C. How do you cure it? I need vegetables. What will happen next? Next, I will lose my teeth one by one, and my fingernails will fall off too. Fuchun, do you know about Zhuangzi? One day, Dongguozi asked Zhuangzi, "You always talk about Tao, where is it?" Zhuangzi replied, "Tao is in feces." (Tao is omnipresent) Fuchun, you brought me hope, twice. The first time, when you took the stool out; the second time, when you brought the stool back. Fuchun, you are getting so close to the Aurora station. What else did this bro Zhuangzi say? Rather than leave them to moisten each other with their damp and spittle, it would be far better to let them forget themselves in their native rivers and lakes. In modern Chinese, please. Two fish were trapped in a dried-up lake, so they used their saliva to keep each other moist. However, it would be much better, if they can just forget each other and go back to their rivers and lakes, to seek their respective happiness. For better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, regardless of how many teeth you have left, no matter if you are going to be a cripple or not, regardless of how many days since you've showered, no matter if you smell good or nasty, I will always love you. Until death do us part. Jing Ruyi, right here, at the end of the world do you take Wu Fuchun, as your lawfully wedded husband? Regardless of his insincere attitude that he used to have towards eternal love; regardless of his ignorance of everything that you told him in your professional view; regardless of how he used to be someone who only believed in his bank account before he met you. I believe bro Zhuangzi said it the wrong way around. Rather than let them forget themselves in their native rivers and lakes, it would be far better to leave them to moisten each other with their saliva. Wu Fuchun, thank you. But, I don't. I want you to take care of yourself and live a happy life. This is the Antarctic Survival Guide I made for you. You dummy, am I supposed to take it out and read it when an avalanche is happening? I don't care. Just read it. I like whales. [Antarctic Survival Guide] They sing beautiful songs, while stretching out their graceful fins. It reminds me of how powerful life should be. Bang, and just like that, they leap out of the ocean. Polar night is coming up soon, but don't give up. If you can see polar lights that means it's a clear day. Make the most of your time and keep searching. The ice is getting thicker, you need to catch more fish and store them. You musn't let your boots and socks get wet. When the fuel runs out, you can use furniture as fuel. When even the wood is used up, you should set out with the sleds, and take everything you can take with you. Walk 20 kilometers south and just keep searching. Don't come back anymore. As you said before, you'd rather die on the road. Ruyi once said, life should be powerful, just like you. I once thought I was powerful too. But I have tried every direction. What do I do if she dies? I remember the last time you dug a hole, it was for survival. I am exhausted. I cannot go any further. I won't allow that. As the fortuneteller said, you will die a natural death as a wealthy man surrounded by grandchildren. I won't allow you to stay here with me. I like it here. But there is no place for you beside me. This is my destiny, but not yours. I want to read a poem to you: When I lay to rest, I want you to live. I'll wait for you. I want your ears still to hear the wind, I want you to smell the sea's aroma that we loved together… Anyone there? Anyone there? Anyone there....? What are you doing? Come back! Let me go! Let me go home…! Ruyi! I like it here. But there is no place for you beside me. This is my destiny, but not yours. When I lay to rest, I want you to live. I'll wait for you. I am back. I want your ears still to hear the wind, I want you to smell the sea's aroma that we loved together to continue to walk on the sand we walked on together. I hope what I love will continue to live, and you whom I love and sang above everything else. And so, you must continue to flourish, . full of life Credits [No matter how long the polar night,] [the sun will rise.] [Once the sun rises,] [it will bring light and warmth.] [Wishing all lovers] [will never have to forget each other in their native rivers and lakes.] [Till the End of the World] [December 30th, 1984 China's Antarctica Science Team arrives at the South Pole for the first time.] [China's flag flutters on the mysterious continent for the first time.] [At the South Pole, the average temperature is minus 25 degrees centigrade.] [The wind level can be three times the power of a hurricane.] [The mean elevation is 2,350 meters.] [Ice sheets average 2,500 meters thick.] [In such a harsh environment,] [members of the first expedition team worked 17 hours each day] [before the polar night's arrival.] [In only 40 days, they built the first Chinese research station in Antarctica.] [On February 2nd, 1985, the Great Wall Station (Antarctica) was finished] [and China started its scientific research in the South Pole.] [China's Antarctica scientific expedition has continued for the past 34 years.] [Great Wall Station - Zhongshan Station - Kunlun Station] [On this harsh 14 million kilometer continent, they continue to explore the unknown.] [Member of the 31st Great Wall Winter Team] [Great Wall Station's Doctor] [Great Wall Station's Chef] [Great Wall Station's Repair Mechanic] [Great Wall Station's Electricity Repairman] [Great Wall Station's Meteorological Forecaster] [Great Wall Station's Meteorological Observer] [Great Wall Station's Electrical Engineer] [Station Master of Great Wall Station 29th Antarctica Scientific Expedition Team, Yong Yu] [Station Master of Great Wall Station 30th Antarctica Scientific Expedition Team, Jianjun Cao] [Station Master of Great Wall Station 31st Antarctica Scientific Expedition Team, Ning Xu] [On November 25th, 2015, the film crew of "Till The End of the World" arrived at the South Pole.] [The crew was lucky to have the chance to face a polar storm with the scientific expedition,] [to go across the dangerous ice sheet together,] [to experience hardship together] [and to appreciate the true South Pole.] [On November 17th, 2015, it was time for the crew to say goodbye to the South Pole,] [but the team left behind would continue to hold their ground] [and devote themselves to Chinese polar research.] Thank you for watching "Till the End of the World" A big "thank you" to our entire team.
