(contemplative music) (mortars firing) - Not any more it's not. (machine guns firing) (ethereal music) (calm music) - Oh sorry. Do you know who you are? I ain't gonna guess it, okay okay. You are Kimberly Radford. - Emily. - I mean Emily Radford. I'm a big fan. Death Row right, right? Can I have your autograph? Shit man, right here, unreal. My wife is not gonna believe it. - Alright let's leave Mrs. Radford alone. Nice seeing you. - What's this Ms. Radford shit? Think we've known each other a little too long for that. It's been a while. - It sure has. Want some coffee? Mike will be back in a second. How about you? - Nothing thanks. - Rex I'd like you to meet Andre. Andre Siegel is one of my oldest friends. Rex Anderson, they used to call him the mad man. - Not so much mad anymore, just generally pissed off. - Rex used to know me when I couldn't pay my rent. - Here you go. - Thanks. - Still got the horses Ms. Radford? - No I sold them. I'm just not up around enough. - That's too bad. - [Emily] Doesn't look much like the old days does it Rex? - [Rex] Junior's running it like a business now. It's all good. - [Michael] Look I was running clubs long before your balls dropped. - [Louis] Look it's what they want. - Well it's not what I want. I don't want that stuff in here. I don't need that shit in here. That's why I got liquor license. Now look I like you so I'm gonna give you a break and not end your career right here and now. But you do it again you're done comprende? - Hey you know you're the boss alright. - See you tonight. - Alright. - Emily. - Hello Michael. - Oh my God you look fantastic. - Thank you. - Hey Rex Junior bought a box of candy from some ghetto kid. Can you stow it on your way out? - Sure. - Good to see you Michael. What was that all about? - All gap and no zeal. No one respects me anymore. And Louis is a travesty, the man's been too long. Have a seat. (upbeat music) How you been? - I'm always good. Junior still playing the neighbor saint? - Ain't that the truth? This him? - [Emily] Michael, Andre Siegel. We met in the Philippines. - On that Vietnam nurse thing? - No, Kate Hodgkins, the Naturalist. - Yeah I read about that. - They hired Andre to help me get in shape. Hodgkins was pretty buff. - He did a good job. - He's my trainer for life. And he's a fantastic martial artist. - Emily I've seen martial artists put to sleep by rank amateur street fighters. - He can fight. He was in the French Foreign Legion for Christ sakes. - Really? - [Emily] Yes. - I didn't know anyone really joined the Foreign Legion. You speak good English? - I speak five languages sir. - Well I guess it doesn't matter much anyway. Come by tonight at 8:30, wear black. Does he have a suit? - Thank you, you won't regret it. - If Rex okay you, the rate's 150. You work nine to five, that's p.m. not a.m. Any questions? - [Andre] No questions sir. - Good. See you tonight. - Well you've got a job now unless you fuck it up. - I won't. - You better not. Andre maybe you should get your own place. - I can get my own place. - I've got another picture coming up and I'm gonna be gone awhile. - I understand. - Then were in sync. (contemplative music) Why'd they name you Andre, your parents? - My parents didn't name me Andre. - Then who did? - When you join the Legion you are christened. Helps you forget who you were before. - War again. The drama of battle. You did all that under the wrong name? - A long time ago, not the wrong name. (calm music) - I like the thought of keeping the clothes and recycling the man. - I'll pay for it. - No, I enjoy giving it. (calm music) (muted club music) - Stay on channel one, keep it short. Michael's got one of these in his office so don't say anything stupid. We use three codes here. Code blue come immediately but no emergency. Code yellow you come immediately serious situation. Code red, shit's hit the fan. No matter what code I use you come immediately okay. Now stick with me tonight and I'll show you the ropes unless we have any gun fights, knife fights, fist fights. Check check. Now you're not a big guy so they're gonna fuck with you. Watch your back. We're outnumbered here like 60 to one. So when the shit does hit the fan there ain't nowhere to hide, come on. To be honest you don't look much like a bouncer. If I was you I'd hide tonight, find a good reason to stay in the dark. Come on and meet the guys. This is Serb, he's got a fucked up sense of humor. - How you doing man? It's night to meet you. You look like my grandmother. - This is Mourad, he's an ugly mother fucker. - Good to meet you. - [Rex] Billy Two Hats, he talks too much. Just tell him to shut up. - No I don't. - Guys meet Andre. Now get to work you anti-social retards. (club dance music) - [Serb] Well poured partner. - Thanks bro. You know I hand picked everyone of these guys. (muted club music) Ain't none of them forced on me. - Always an angle. New lighting program funky enough for you big fella? - Yeah, it's really nice. - You alright? Alright sir. - Like anybody cares, party time. (club dance music) Keep an eye for drunks, throw them out. (club dance music) - [Drunk] You bitch. - Okay you're out. (club dance music) (punches landing) - Cool there stud he ain't moving no more. He hit the jewels, he got happy too quick. - Look at this mess. The new guy's an animal. - Yee doggy you did that? (body thumps) (club dance music) - Get him out of here front door. (muted club music) - Hey Mike wants to see you. (muted club music) - Thanks Rex we'll see you tonight pal. (muted club music) Well you handle yourself pretty well. Except you were a little rough on the customers. Your job is to subdue them and prevent them from doing any more damage to anyone or anything with the minimum of force. And I emphasize the word minimum you understand? - Yes sir. - Well Rex says you're alright and that's okay by me, for now. Welcome aboard. - Thank you sir. (engines rumbling) - You ride a bike? - [Andre] Yeah. - Maybe I get you a good deal. - You know where I work. - Everybody needs transportation. (engines rumbling) (calm music) (mortars exploding) (calm music) - Did you get a parking space? - I don't have a car. - My name is Janie, I live across from you. - Hi Andre, nice to meet you. - Beautiful day isn't it? I'll catch you later. - Catch you later. (contemplative music) (alarm clock beeping) - The thing I know about real tough guys, they don't look like muscle builders. Most of those mother fuckers are homos. They're pumping iron in the morning. Spend all day in front of a mirror like a broad. The real tough guy nobody can see. He could be skinny bastard Branco. You're new around here so he wants to pummel you around a little. (punches landing) He's quick mother fucker. (punches landing) - Give me about five minutes. (punches landing) (dramatic music) - You alright man, you okay? - [Andre] Sorry I lost it. (helicopter blades whirring) - You like the food bro? - It's good. - When you work night shift you're always hungry, you're always tired. I remember working night shift in Zagreb. Same thing bro, always hungry always tired. - When did you leave Zagreb? - 1988. Have you been to my home? - I spent some time in Leningradsky. - [Serb] When? - '89, fall of '90. - You fought there? - That's what I did. - Which side? - Both sides. (laughing) - Those not written in the book of life were tossed into the lake of fire. So it is said in the book of Romans. You, you can be the one. You can make a difference. Jesus said the Lord hurled Lucifer down from Heaven like a holey lightening bolt and said go ye from this place. - Hey got bother someone else. Don't make me fucking kill you. Fucker. Fucking believe this shit. Baby. - Baby? What's wrong with your phone Serb? What can't call me you fuck? You think I'm just gonna sit around and wait for you? Well guess what I'm not because I wait for no one especially not you. Sorry, sorry. - Come here, I love you. - Oh come here (grunts) oh you love me whatever. - [Serb] Give me a kiss. - Janie, Serb. - You're so beautiful. - I don't look beautiful. I don't even know who that is. - His name is Andre, we've already met. - Really? - He lives across from me, we're neighbors. You certainly look more awake. - Night shift. You want something to drink? - Sure, iced tea thanks. - Excuse me can I have some iced tea please? * All the people and the places that we know * - Did you get moved in okay? - Yeah all finished. I dint have much to move though. Left most my stuff back home. - Where's back home? - South Dakota. I came here about a month ago and Ellie put me up 'til I found my place. - [Andre] You like it? - I love it. It sounds cliche but I've come here to act and it's like I arrived you know? What do you do? - I'm a bouncer at the club. - Really? - Yeah why won't you stop by and visit our club? - I can't I've got class in the morning. We're doing Cyrano. I'm working on the French accent no. (speaking in foreign language) What did you say? What did he say? - He said he's married with eight kids but they don't mind. - Did not. - Oh shut up, don't be such an asshole. - You should come and see us. - We'll see what happens. (upbeat music) (knocking on door) - Hi. - Hi. - You should lock your door. - We never lock our doors back home. I'll be out in a second. - I just wanted to tell you if you come by the club tonight-- - What? - If you could ask for me I can get you comped. - Alright. - I should go. Bye. - [Janie] Bye. (calm music) (club dance music) - You can't just go in there you gotta be invited. It's not all it's cracked up to be. Don't let the letters VIP impress you. Most of those guys over there, they're just walking turds with money. - What makes him so special. - Junior Lopez? He owns the club. - I thought it was Michael's. - [Rex] What were you born yesterday? - [Andre] Day before. - All these guys are connected. I thought you knew that when you started. - [Andre] So Junior owns the club. - Not on paper. Michael runs it, we keep it safe. - No questions. - Nah. Watch these guys when they laugh, they're nervous. His crew will open a heart beat just to impress the prick. And Junior loves it. - [Andre] He's got a gun. - [Rex] Red, he's Junior's muscle. - Looks like an asshole to me. - Yeah, well just remember it's his moola that pays our bills, so be humble. (muted club music) (club dance music) - Hey. - Hey. Good to see you. - We just got here. - Hey is Michael back there? - Yeah second floor VIP. - Hey I'm glad you made it. - Okay, I need a drink, it's hot outside. - Excuse me can I have a water please? - [Bartender] Here you go. - Thank you. - I only get outside when we close everything up. - That must suck. - It's light when I get in, light when I get out. Just a long long day. - Amidst throwing the guys out. - Doesn't bother me much, it's a job. (club dance music) - What's that over there? - The VIP's and their guests. - I'm a guest, can I go up there? - Maybe some other time okay. - I think I'd like that drink now. (dramatic music) I thought I heard you. You should lock your doors you know. We've got nothing like that in South Dakota. We got a couple of bars where farmers go to get drunk and pinball machines and a jukebox but that's about it. - [Andre] I'm glad you had a good time. - I think I mixed my drinks a little. - It happens. (calm music) - I love this city. - Would you like some coffee or soda? I have soda. - Do you think I'm attractive? - Or just some water? - Do you think I'm beautiful? - [Andre] I'll make some coffee. - Do you? - Sure. - Do you want to kiss me? - Janie you had way too much to drink. - You know you wan to. That's all you really want from me right? - Listen you don't know anything about my life. You don't even know who I am. You're drunk, that's not my way. (contemplative music) (knocking on door) - Hi. - Andre. Gosh what time is it? - You want me to come back later? - No no that's fine. What you need? - It's Thursday we're scheduled to work out remember? - Oh shit Andre I completely forgot. Can we do it tomorrow? - No problem. - I'm sorry you came all this way. - It's okay I wanted to see you anyway. (contemplative music) - You should have called. - For the suit. - See you later? - Sure. (club dance music) - Ooh mama look at you. Angel from God 10 o'clock. Work it mama, Billy Boy's in Heaven. Doggy. (club dance music) - Ho ho, ho ho ho, hey. - Hey. - Hey you know you didn't have that blue dress on in my dream. - Oh stop. (muted club music) - Hey. - Hey. - How you doing? - Good. - I was watching you out there. - Oh really? - Yeah you dance pretty well. - Thanks. - So what do you do, you got a job? - I take acting classes. - Oh you're an actress? Must be pretty tough out there. But not for you right? You're so beautiful. No I mean it, your face, your body, the way you move. You have an air of classic serene grace about you. It overwhelms me. - I've seen you somewhere before. - Oh yeah I'm in the movies. - Oh. - No I'm kidding. I own the place. - Oh really? - Yeah. Have you ever seen something so incredibly beautiful, so magnificent you just had to turn away? - You're just saying that. - No I mean it. Listen. You want to make some money? - What do you mean? - What do I mean? You hustling me? - [Girl] How much money are we talking about? - [Radio] Code red main area. (people shouting in distance) (punches landing) (grunting) - Where the hell have you been? Get him out of here. Go on get him out. (dramatic music) (water running) - How you doing? - Alright. - Fuck me. - Christ you been stabbed you dumb mother fucker. EMS here on ASAP. Come on. - Okay antibiotics three times a day after meals. And take two of these as needed for pain. But no more than two every four hours and no more than eight a day. - Thanks. Keep the pain pills but I'll take the antibiotics. - Suit yourself. You know you're a very lucky man Mr. Siegel. - Since we're friends you should call me Andre. - I beg your pardon? - [Andre] You stitched up wounds, makes you my friend right? - It was nothing personal. I'm just doing my job. - Doesn't matter. - Look Mr. Siegel when I stitched you up I found scar tissue from five other guns shot wounds, and scars from lacerations that appear to be knife wounds. We counted 14 total. Your X-ray shows several foreign metallic objects and your ribs look like they were set by a blind man. In my opinion, since we're friends, maybe you should consider a new line of work. - See only a friend would care. - You can put your shirt on now. (suspenseful music) - [Papa] I hope this letter finds you in good health. Do not be angry with Emily. When she contacted us we begged for your address. We think of you every day, Mother speaks of nothing else. She worries she will never see you again. I am aware of the difficulties of life. I simply wish to remind of your home and family who love you very much. Please write your mother, adieu Papa. (contemplative music) (phone beeps) - [Phone] Yes hello. Hello? Hello. (contemplative music) - You look like a man who could use some good news. Come on. Here she is. 750 CC's, in line four cylinder, custom fit pipes. Zero to 60 in 3.6 seconds, that is if you can hang on. - It's a beauty. - Yeah, it's not American but it's yours. That is after 36 easy payments. - Thank you bro. - Andre some guy saying he licks Foreign Legion tearing up the place. - Dumb bastard, homo bunch of faggots. (punch lands) I'm not leaving until I finish my drink. - [Andre] Yeah I know him. Milo, God damned-- - About God damned time. - Buenos dias bro. - It's good man. - We'll see you guys later. - Remember Luke Nealy? Crazy fuck. And Jenkins? Pastoneck? Sims? Half the men in those pictures are dead now. - Sims have any kids? - Boy and a girl, London. - Where are you set to go? - Strafco's monster spotted nationals. Mostly Albanian, some in the woods. We oversee their training, also some field experience. Christ every kid over 15 has a rifle. We go in two weeks. - And who's paying? - That's the best part. It's government funded all handled electronically. They advance the money straight to your account. No money's there you don't go. It's hot over there Andre, I'd like you there. - Things have changed Milo. I have a roof over my head now. I haven't shot in a long time and it doesn't bother me a bit. - I need you on my flank Andre. - Give me a couple days. - You got a week. I go to San Diego to see a man about ordinance. I get back we go. - I'll think it over. I don't understand this hesitancy. A man used to be revered when he went to war. People today just can't take the violence. Makes them queasy. You're a freak of nature Andre. You don't belong here anymore than I do. (contemplative music) - Hey Andre. - See you later. - Hey. - Hi. - How you been? - Good. Where are you running to? - Nowhere. I've not seen you around much. - Yeah I'm sorry. - What you been up to? - Not much. - Not much? - No. - It's good to see you. You want to walk? - Look I think I need to apologize here. I said some things and I'm sorry. I was out of control. - It's okay, don't worry about it. - I was hurt and angry and very drunk. And I don't take rejection very well. I thought you were pushing me away because you didn't like me. - No that's not it. - How did you get those scars? - There's not much to tell. I got wounded, the wounds healed and the left scars. That's it. - You've seen a lot of death haven't you? - It's unavoidable sometimes. - I just wanted a fair chance like a tryout. - Is that why you came here? - Yeah, I just didn't want to be a corny old mother with a permanent headache and bad hair. - You'll miss it someday. (contemplative music) - I'll never felt anything like that. It's like flying. The wind and the noise. It's incredible. Do you ever feel like we're alone in this world? - Yeah. - I feel like I'm different from everybody else. Like I have a destiny to fulfill or something. Do you ever feel that way? - [Andre] Sometimes. - I know I can make it out here. I just need someone to believe in me. - I believe in you. - Do you? - Yeah. (contemplative music) (club dance music) - Beer. - [Red] Hey Mark get him a beer. (club dance music) - Yo Junior! Junior Lopez! You killed my sister! Come down here you fucking coward! (glass shattering) (punch lands) (tense music) What did you hit me for? - You threw a glass. What do you want me to do then? (tense music) - You no my mother won't leave the house 'cause she can't stop crying? You know my father won't speak at all? She was 15, just a little girl. He whored out my baby sister man. I had to identify her body in the parking lot 'cause she OD'd. - Go home. Be with your family they need you now, go. * True love * I want to hold you feel you - Andre. From Junior. (suspenseful music) - What for? - It's his way of saying thank you. - For doing my job? - You really think Rex buys Harleys on 150 plus tips? Get out of here. - I'm thinking about highlights. - They use lemon juice on Baywatch. - [Janie] How do you know? - 'Cause I dated one of the actors. - Which one? - As if, he was like an extra in maybe one episode. - Two, and he had lines. - Ah, he's drowning. Not quote lines. - SAG card though. - He got a SAG card for that? - Yeah. But he's a bum you know. I don't want to talk about him. What's up with bouncer boy? Are you guys serious? - He's not a boy, he's a man. - Did you do him? - None of your business. - Sorry. - [Red] Hello my dear. - Hey Babe why don't you get us something to drink? - Okay. Hello ladies. Enjoying the sun ladies? - Yeah it's nice. - This is my building. I'm Junior Lopez. You know what I told Annie? I said Annie have you ever seen something so incredibly beautiful, something so stunning, that you just had to turn away? It's just instinct to just go (growls) That's how I felt when I first saw you. No I'm serious. - Janie Chambers, it's my pleasure. - Janie Chambers I like that. Well listen we gotta go. Why don't you stop by me club tonight and be my guest. - Have a little dinner, a little dancing? - Sure. - I don't know. - Hey come on you never know who's gonna be there. - Hey don't worry about it Red. We're no boy scouts but I'm sure you'll have a good time. - Sure okay. - Alright. (phone beeps) - [Phone] Hello. (speaking in foreign language) (knocking on door) - So this is where you live. How's work? Michael says you're doing well. - What do you need? - I heard you're fucking some little bitch. - You gotta get your hearing checked. - So you're not. - No. - Andre where do you see yourself in five years? - I don't know. - I don't think L.A. is the town for you. - Just a city like any other city. - No listen to me. This city can do strange things to you. It can make you do things that you wouldn't normally do. Call me if you need anything won't you? - You did enough already. (calm music) You know they call it magic hour out here. - I can't keep seeing you Andre. - Why is there someone else? - He cares about me. And he wants to help me with my career. (contemplative music) (upbeat music) (club dance music) - What do you go there? - Rolex. - Yeah, is it yours? - I'm buying it cheap too. They were selling them for 900 bucks. Sold it right off the factory floor. Look right there on the back ain't no serial number. You see that? Got it brand new in a little shop or something. Word has it if you put it on it'll try to fuck him. - Just don't know what I'm gonna do with such a sweet sweet deal. - Listen Billy I won't lie, this is where I say take or leave it or shove it up your ass, I don't care. Hey Andre what's up? - What the fuck is wrong with him? - Maybe he just bought a fake Rolex. Andre, walk with me, come on. (muted club music) What's up man? You don't seem like your usual cheerful self. Need to borrow some money? Been doing some blow to keep you on your toes? Chumps like to take some bunk just to keep it tight. Next thing you know they're stealing from the till just to keep it going. - I'm just tired man. - Yeah? It's girl trouble isn't it? Listen man you're off to a good start. The crowd likes you, Michael likes you. Fuck I even like you. These are good things Andre stay focused. Don't fuck up. - Anything else? (muted club music) (contemplative music) Get a grip Andre. She's just a fucking girl. She's just a girl man. (muted club music) - It's not a good idea to have them here boss. They're just looking to start trouble with Junior. - Give me a minute. If they don't calm down back me up. Hey Coco. Coco can you keep it down a little? I appreciate your business, ladies and all. - [Coco] Why you busting my balls Michael? - Just keep it down that's all. I appreciate your business alright, just a warning. - I spend a lot money in here. - [Michael] Thank you, I know you do. - Fucking Liberace faggot. - One more bottle breaks they're history. - [Coco] Hey where's the champaign? Is there a waitress in this fucking place? - That's it. Alright guys, time to go. - We're just having ourselves a good time. - Hell I know you're having a good time Mr. Coco but good time's over, you guys gotta to go. Let's keep it dignified. (muted club music) - It's Rex isn't it? Isn't that him? (muted club music) Well Mr. Rex. Come on my man. Look I take this to be cool on this one my brother. But fight isn't with him. Besides me and the guys here we're just having a little bit of fun. You know, fucking around. (glass breaks) (punches landing) (dramatic music) This ain't over. Junior, you gonna run you fucking spic. (muted club music) Get off me mother fucker. (grunting) You're fucking dead. Nobody touches me. We going death row tonight. You're fucking dead. - Get on out of here before we kick your ass for real. - Okay guys tool up. I think a shit storm's a brewing. Let's get inside. Come on. Get in. - Junior I called the cops. - Call them back. - What do you mean call them back? They busted up the club. - Call them back-- - Junior I got a job to do. Sit down man. I got a job to do, let me do my job. - No cops. - [Michael] Junior let me do my job. (muted club music) (dramatic music) - First rule of a gun fight, bring a gun. Ain't that right Rex? - Let's drop that hill billy shit just for five minutes. - [Billy] He needs to cool down. - [Andre] What if they don't? - Then we do our jobs. Get back to your sections. - [Billy] Hey, you're still grounded. - Let's go. - Andre how's the bike buddy? - It's running good. - You up for a ride? Ain't been to TJ for a while. (upbeat music) Man she's cute but she ain't that cute. Now we got a job to do. (upbeat music) - So that's it then, Junior Lopez ? - Yeah so he's helping me. - How? - He knows people. - Who does he know? - Directors and producers. - Oh really? - Listen Andre you're a cool guy. Don't make this difficult okay. - He's no good for you. - Y'all have your ID's ready. Couple of fat boys keep cruising by scoping us out. - Have Michael call the cops and have Serb watch Junior. Mourad get this crown inside. - [Mourad] Okie dokie. - These fucks set this up so they cap Junior. We're gonna keep it outside so you stay sharp. Do you hear me? - Yeah, stay sharp right? (muted club music) (club dance music) (guns firing) - [Rex] Don't wait for his shit, take him down now. (guns firing) (all talking at once) - [Coco] God damn it, fuck you Junior. Jesus just go go, get the fuck out of here. - Get down now, check this guy. Come on, come on, get him off. Get him in the building. Come on you guys move it. Come on. Watch your backs. (sirens blaring) (helicopter blades whirring) (suspenseful music) - Mr. Siegel. Mr. Siegel? Can you hear me? (suspenseful music) - Andre remember? - Welcome back Andre. I just removed a nine millimeter slug from your spleen. You're becoming a valued customer here. - How long am I gonna be here? - Oh about a week or two. You're strong. And very lucky. - Has anyone been looking for me? - Why are you avoiding someone? (contemplative music) - You know there's not one good looking nurse in this entire fucking hospital. - They heard you were coming. - I don't like them anyway they smell like chemicals. You ever think about what we've done Andre? I don't mean the bad dreams I mean really think about the life we've led? Been a grand life. You and me, we've done things that most people can only imagine in their wildest dreams. You're not bullet proof. Remember after the Tootsie uprising when you caught miliaria? - Yeah, young and stupid. - I got you that village witch doctor. Told him I'd fix his Land Rover if he'd help you. - Guess I'm lucky to be alive. - Told him I was going in to town for spares just never came back. Probably put a curse on you. - Figures. - You won't be coming with me will you? - No, not this time. I can't. - I can't make you. (contemplative music) - Milo. Milo. Watch your back. (contemplative music) - In the gut hey? That's too bad. Junior appreciates what you've done for him. Sends his best, wishes you a speedy recovery. Wants you to go by and see him when you get done. You know I was in here three months ago. I got busted up in a fight. And Junior never sent nobody to come and check on me. Just thought you might want to know that. (contemplative music) (knocking on door) (contemplative music) (muted club music) - See I told them you'd be back. Rex said no but I said it'd take more than a bullet to keep old Andre away. Rex didn't I tell you? - Do you ever shut up? It's good to have you back here. Okay you guys, let's get back to work. (muted club music) (club dance music) - Hey Junior wants to see you. - Right now? - Now, now. (club dance music) - Hey bud what's up? - Junior's waiting. - And what does Junior want? - He doesn't know 'cause he hasn't seen him yet. (club dance music) - Sales are down and you need to do something about it. (muted club music) Andre sit. How you doing? He's always so serious. (muted club music) Here have a drink. (muted club music) I like loyalty. Loyalty is good. (muted club music) You know they say the key to immortality is to live a life worth remembering. That's what this is all about, the journey. I grew up in the streets, big deal. We all come from somewhere. We've all been through something. We all have a secret to hide right? The difference is I'm in charge. Everything you see here I've built on my own. You do your job and you'll learn a lot from me. (muted club music) (club dance music) - You know in his eyes you ain't earned that. It's jut a retainer. Pretty soon he'll snap his fingers and expect you to come a running, you comprende? - It's just business. (club dance music) - Hey hey bouncer boy. - Catch you later. (club dance music) - New look? - Junior says I've blossomed. Don't you like the new me? - Change isn't always good. - But it's inevitable. - You moved. I missed you. - I'm sorry you're time was up. (club dance music) - The problem was him. He doesn't have a plan. Muslims usually never have a plan. That's why I came here, to get away from the shit. I want my own gym, an American business you know. - Sounds really nice. - You can be head of security. Yeah. I'm gonna make it nice, elegant. I'm gonna have waiters wearing tuxedos, valet parking, and personal trainers. - Very good. - You got to have a plan man. A man without a plan is not a man at all, right? - That's right. - [Maurice] What's your plan Andre? - I' don't have one. Thanks. - Thanks. (contemplative music) - Permits. Debt. And disillusion. Action. It's begun. (club dance music) - Junior wants you. - Watch your six man. - [Junior] What do you want to do? You want to go dancing? - I want a drink. - You want a drink. I don't want you to drink. - [Janie] Then sit down. - I'll sit down. I'll bite. - That's fine. (muted club music) - We're going on a little trip. - Where to? - You don't ask questions you do as you're told. - Red Red Red be nice. He's working on being in charge. You learn that. Don't ask questions do as you're told, nothing personal. But here's the game. I want you guys to go on a new lot. Red if Andre fucks up it's Andre's ass, you fucked up. Andre if Red fucks up it's still your ass. But he never fucks up, that's why I like him. Just need incentives. - Let's go. I don't like working with people I don't know you know. I believe in promoting from within. I also believe in loyalty. I'm as loyal as an Irish fucking Setter. That's why they call me Red. I don't know you okay. You're a bouncer at a club, I'm supposed to trust you? You wonder why I complain? I just want you to understand what I'm saying here okay. I mean you know who I am right? - Why don't you tell someone who gives a shit? (suspenseful music) - Look you wait here okay. Nobody gets in alright Stretch. (suspenseful music) (grunting) (dramatic music) Lets go come on. (gun firing) Lets go. (dramatic music) (suspenseful music) Fuck man. I mean I've seen that Jolly Green Jerkoff take out a whole crew by himself. I mean what you did back there. - Forget about it. It's no big deal. - No no, hey, look I'll never forget it. I told you I'm as loyal as a dog. - Who was he? - Marco. Probably his slug they lifted from your ass. One of Coco's boys trying to move in on our regional holdings. I keep telling them man it ain't worth it - Was that the guy that shot me? - Possible. How's that for Karma? - No shit. (contemplative music) - He did that? He saved you? What are fucking, you got a gun. He save you? That guy saved you? What's wrong with you? How can that guy save you? (upbeat music) (mortars exploding) (screaming in pain) (machine guns firing) (contemplative music) - So intense. - You're so lucky. I haven't felt like this since I was a little kid. - It's incredible. I can feel everything. It's like we're joined, like one. (contemplative music) - You'll burn in the sun. You're pale skinned like me. - You shouldn't be here Andre. What happened to your head? - I like this place. Sun, flowers, smells. Did you know they have a juice bar in the lobby? - Yeah I know. What are you doing here? - I had time to think about what you said, remember? - What was that? - You said it's good to have a goal, a dream. - Was a high? - You weren't even drunk. You were right. There's a reason I'm here. Just like there was a reason for Africa, Thailand, and Bosnia. There are reasons for everything and you helped me see that. - You're talking about fate Andre. Fate is for losers who are looking for something to blame. I'm not the girl for you. I've already made that choice. (contemplative music) - Did he do that to you? - Just leave me alone Andre. - Well Legionnaire if you are reading this I'm dead. And Danny actually came through. I could have used you here Andre. It's different. I'm the most experienced guy here. I've enclosed a list of some families. Split my dough like we talked about. Take what you need and have a drink on old Milo. We made a mistake in Africa old friend. For all we've now done we should have done a camera roll and finished it there. We aren't supposed to get old. Kill them all Andre. Until next time, Milo. (contemplative music) - I got a great story. - Andre come on, listen to this story, come here. - [Junior] We can't forget about good old Andre. - Come on Andre over here, come here, come here. (muted club music) - You'll like this story. Tell him the good one boss. - Alright. (muted club music) I was 11 years old and this friend of my father's, another potato picking Cesar Chavez (all laughing) he tells me he's got this knife. So he pulls it out and it's fucking beautiful, I mean it's got ivory blue handles. Gorgeous knife I mean it just made your palms sweat. So one night I follow him home. I go up the stairs and I go. (all laughing) And all of a sudden this guy, he opens up the door and he goes (speaking in foreign language) (Red laughing) Then I whip out my knife and I say hey you forgot something. And I walk up and I look at him in the eyes and I stab him in the belly 24 times. (growling) - I'm fucking dead. - Come here baby get up. (muted club music) So let me finish. So the guy grabs me by the throat, starts choking the shit out of me, screaming like some crazy nutty local. It was like killing a fucking raging bull. But the best part, I got the knife. (muted club music) If you want something you gotta die for it. If you're not gonna die for it you might as well forget all about it. Put it right out of your mind. (muted club music) You ever met Janie? I'm sorry I didn't fucking think about it. - He lives in my building. - I bet he does. The rest of the girls I don't know. They just got here today. You guys sure look at each other enough. You like that? You don't like this, you don't like this? You don't like that, you like that? I like it too. I like the smell of her hair, the curve of her thighs. Oh yeah yeah come here baby. You like that guy? - No. - Would you kiss that guy? - No. - Would you fuck that guy? - Of course not. - You can tell me the truth. - No. - That's my girl. What the fuck are you looking at? - What? - Oh now you're gonna give me attitude? You cross Junior he's gonna fuck you up. - I don't need your advice. - You can take it, leave it, or shove it up your ass. But while you're on the clock you forget the skirt and get your thick head wrapped around the job. And don't go back to her place. (muted club music) - You still have to complete me. Sit down. (muted club music) Sit down. - No. - Listen. You like this guy? What you do, sleep with him? Come here. What? (punch lands) - Jesus Christ Junior. - [Janie] What the fuck? - Get off me, get off me. - You gonna hit me now, come on. - [Billy] Hey what's wrong with y'all? - It's alright it's alright we're done, it's over. Nothing's happening alright. - [Billy] You okay? - I'm okay. - [Billy] Is she alright? - [Red] She's alright we're gonna take her home. - She don't look alright. You sure she's okay? - I told you she's alright, everything's perfect. We'll take care of it okay. (punch lands) - [Andre] Bitch. - You dead beat cop fucker just hit me in my own club? Let him up, let him up, let him up. - Fucking kill you. - It's okay, it's okay, let me go. How many times does a guy gotta give a guy a break before he bites me in the God damn ass? You are gonna wish you never met me. You're a fucking French. - You killed a girl. (all shouting at once) - You're dead, you're fucking dead. I'm alright let go of me. - Hey hey hey. Get him the hell out of here Rex. Andre you're history. Get him out of here. - I'm gonna protect you man okay. - That's bullshit. - I here Paradise is hiring. I gotta a buddy there I'm gonna call. - Thanks man. - It's been very nice working. - Thank you ever so much. - Stay cool man. Let's go we got a job to do guys. (contemplative music) - Janie. - What are you doing, are you following me? - I can't get you out of my head. Here take this money. - Andre I can't take any-- - You gotta leave you can't stay here, please. - I can't take your money. - Please Janie. You gotta get out of here. - You're losing it Andre, you started scaring me. - Please, please Janie. - So you take care of her. I like this girl, she's good okay. - Okay. - Alright you have a nice time, you got it. (contemplative music) What's this look for? - Why are you making me do this? - Do what? - [Janie] I don't know want to do this. - [Junior] Yes you do. - [Janie] No. - Yes you do. Didn't I tell you how much I love to today? Did I tell you? How much? This much, no I'm kidding this much. - [Janie] Can't I be with you? - [Junior] You can be with me later tonight. I got work to do alright. This is all business. You know it's just business. You want to be in the movies? You don't want to be in the movies? Come here, come on. Jump in there come on. I'm right here, I'm not going anywhere. Alright? You guys have a good time. (upbeat music) - Oh my God Janie. What the fuck did they do to you? (upbeat music) I'm gonna get you out of here. Hold on baby. (upbeat music) - [Emily] Andre it's Emily, I've been trying to... Andre? (upbeat music) (contemplative music) - I asked you for a sign I didn't mean this. (contemplative music) You're such a cruel mean son of a bitch sometimes. (contemplative music) - Hey Andre what are you doing? Hey man Junior finds out you're here we're both fucked. - I want your gun. - [Red] What? - I want your gun. - I can't do that. Did you get kicked in the head today grasshopper or what? Hey look you know we're buddies now right. I owe you a little bit but if I give this to you knowing where you're about to go I mean what does that do for me really you know? - You gonna talk all night or you gonna give me that gun? - Hey look let me tell you something. These guys aren't like me right? These are homeboys from Chiapas way down south. They'll die before they let you even touch him again. (contemplative music) You know what take the gun man. Fucking kill me go ahead. Fucking go on go kill me go ahead. Kill me, do it kill me. - You don't want to go there. (dramatic music) - Let's make a toast to the poorly departed Marco who lived every day as though it was his last. And to my old man who's nothing but a potato picker. But he knew without friends you are nothing, you are nobody, you're dead. You're my friend right? And you're my friend? - Si boss. - And you're my friend, and you're my friend, and you're my friend, and you're my guy, and you're my guy. (all shouting) (meditative music) - How you doing man? Everything cool? (punches landing) Just relax. (meditative music) (punches landing) - Where's fucking Red? Where's my friend Red? - Want me to call him? - Yeah I want to call him. Hey man hey listen. Send some flowers to Janie, got it. And girls, girls, girls, we need girls. You want girls? We all want girls. (dramatic music) - Don't move Andre. - Armando. - Go. - Where's Armando? (dramatic music) - He brought you a little present boss. (speaking in foreign language) - This is unexpected. Would you like some desert? Listen if you wanted to talk you should have just stopped by my club. But you're here so we can talk now. What's the matter Andre? She tell you how good all our dicks taste? (all laughing) - [Armando] Answer the man. - Take it easy Armando. Come on where is your sense of humor? (dramatic music) I like you don't get me wrong. You're just like me. I could see it in your eyes. You're no different. Forget about Janie. She's nothing but a natural born hooker. But you got balls Andre, you got balls. So I tell you what I'm gonna do. Since you're already on your knees if you suck my dick real good and add a little twist I'll forgive you. I might even let you have your old job back. Maybe we could be friends. What do you say? - [Armando] Answer the man. - You probably wouldn't be any good anyway. Go killer. (dramatic music) (speaking in foreign language) (gun fires) (machine gun firing) (dramatic music) - Andre. (gun clicks) (dramatic music) (machine gun firing) (grunting) (dramatic music ends) (calm music) (ethereal music) - [Young Man] Junior Lopez. (ethereal music) (laughing) (guns firing) (ethereal music) - Four DOA's, seven gun shot wounds, fatal and nonfatal, multiple domestic beatings. A lot of dumb ass accidents all in one night. I was getting ready to sign off but it required all three of us to register them all in. - Do I look as though I'm interested in your life story Doctor? - Look Doctor Fisher I just four years post graduate school, I'm a bonafide specialist. I can't work like this. I'd already worked a 20 hour day when they arrived. That was three in the morning. I'm still here, I don't think it's right. - Then tell it to someone who gives a damn. (contemplative music) I do hope you have good health coverage Mr. Siegel. (contemplative music) - Yeah. I gotta start taking it easy. (contemplative music) (upbeat music)
