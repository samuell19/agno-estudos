A TV crew are waiting on Alexanderplatz to give live coverage. I watch the gathering crowd. People are looking up at the sky and waiting for me so that the circus can begin. How gorgeous the light is! Such fantastic light! Action, Aglaya, smile into the camera! My Mama had the best legs in all Romania. I was the world’s smallest trapeze artist before I was born, a real star for 8 months. Mama did the splits high in the air, her belly was strapped into a corset, I stood on my head and looked down from between her thighs. In Romania our dictator was called “The Boss”. He was a secret admirer of Mama's he came only to see her. He hardly missed a performance. We were the Romanian State Circus. Undo my corset quickly! Water! Water! The show must go on! Get in there! He's always stealing my applause! Calm down! Come on, hurry! I was only somebody till the day I was born. Tandarica, you filthy pig! Look at the beautiful baby girl I've given you! Why can I only make girls? ...4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10! Pity she's got no hair! Why don't you give her a name? Without a name we'll mix her up. Oh God! What shall we call her? What's your name, dear? Aglaya! Then it's Aglaya. Let's not call her after a nurse! I want my daughter to be somebody and her name to be somebody's! My Mama gave me my second name so I'd be as famous as her favourite actress. That's how I became Aglayasophialoren. So that I'd be “somebody”. 'Course Papa gave my stepsister a short name. I envied Ana because she was crippled when she was only 9. Anyone who was someone in the circus was crippled in some way. Look who's sitting in the VIP box! You'd better be good! Show him something! You've got plenty to show! Show him those lovely tits of yours. I'm going to give you hell, you commie arse-licker! Comrades, now comes our special act. Tonight at the Romanian State Circus, we are proud to present Sabina! Are you there, God? If you are, don't bite me! Okay! I hate Milo because he hurt Mama! I can hear you snuffling and smacking your lips! Are you hungry? Are you eating? What are you eating? Star? Sabina? Little Sabina! Our star comrade, right? You said she's as pretty as Sophia Loren! You're lying! I said she's prettier than Sophia Loren! Much prettier! And the Wages aren't going up, because the coffers are empty. Are you joking? If she wants a pay rise, Why doesn't she come to see me herself? I'm hungry. Enough! You're the stupidest clown in the Eastern Bloc! The Boss has asked to see Sabina again! The Boss? What do you mean again? What've you dreamt up this time, Milo? We'll hang for this, you fool! You didn't see a thing! Don't mess around! We're crossing the border at dawn! - Mine's not here! - Come on, hurry! Only the artists' passports! Do you hear, Tandarica? We had to leave my uncle back in Romania. They looked him up instead of us and knocked his teeth out. We were sentenced to death. Mama, Papa, Ana - and even me. We're free, We're free! We're Westerners. That was the first time I'd heard the sound of hair. Luckily not everyone hears it. Keep it short. 5 minutes in all. We will be hiring the following artists: Fangluu from Vietnam, Miss Elizabeth from England, Deny and Vicky from Holland, Mr. Tandarica from Romania! I need to talk to the director! Don't upset yourself, dear. Next time. Someone call an ambulance! Ambulance! Come away from there! I saw you hugging her! I'm not blind! Who the fuck cares if I hugged her! I wanted to comfort her because she was sad! You're always prancing around that Chinese girl! Aren't you scared they'll out your dick off? They're not Chinese, they're Vietnamese! They're in big shit. Their snake is sick. They Won't be able to perform! I'm in the shit too. I do nothing but gut chickens. I can hardly hold the ring, my hands are ruined! And I'm worth more than anybody else here. Don't start feeling sorry for yourself! I've told you to think up a new act! - Sticking your foot in your ear Won't do. - You're such a bastard! Another clown will come along who's better at falling on his arse and you'll be finished! Fucking hellfire and damnation! Listen to me! Do you know where I'd really like to be? Where? You'll soon find out! "I love that girl..." If I don't Write, don't answer! The watch? It's OK. I checked it. Shoe hydraulics OK. Ladies and gentlemen, our next performer is Mister Black and White! Weight? Perfect. OK then. OK. Now for the new star of Wunderland Circus, the Flygirl! Has she got cramp? She can't stand on it. The clown act then! What are you doing here? I told you not to talk or play with strangers! But she's not a stranger, she's the Flygirl, the new star! Is that a star? I don't think so! This coat has travelled the whole world and it could tell a tale or two! If I die... I'm going to leave it to the circus museum as a reminder of the great Tandarica! Cheers! That's what fate dealt us men. We have to work our balls off otherwise the family starves! I Won't come home after the show. The director's giving a party for the artists! You there? Do you speak Hungarian? Dear God, help Mama to get a contract too. - Our snake's ill. - That was your last chance! - Leave it, darling, let's go! - Let me talk to him... That was your last chance! No! The snake's sick, what'll we do? If we're ditched, what'll become of us? - Hi! - What do you want? My name's Sabina. I saw the accident with your hair. Leave me be, leave me in peace! Get away from here! Fanglee was lucky in that she couldn't perform ever again. She inherited the ring and straps from her great-grandmother. My mother bought the whole act lock, stock and barrel. Point your toe! Now stretch. And do what I do! Like a cat... You speak Hungarian? Yes! My mama's Hungarian. I'm photo journalist for local paper. Can I take a picture? Lovely! My life is just like a novel. Don't you want to write it if you're a reporter?! I've even got a title: "Iron Gate, the door to freedom"! Good, eh? I've got something to discuss with the nice man. You stay here! Is it pulling too much? Are you okay? Does it hurt? Fanglee told my Mama that anyone who isn't Vietnamese has to eat a lot of cockerel heads because their brain strengthens the hair. You'll learn how to do this, too! We're going to perform together! We'll be the most famous circus family, two generations... tradition, eh? The Flygirl fell! The Flygirl fell! She fell! God helped us. Mama got a decent contract. I felt I had to guard her so she wouldn't fall down too. I made sure she washed her hair in rainwater. It strengthens the hair. Fear could weaken it. Let's see... what's paying the bills nowadays? Mustn't be afraid. Mustn't be afraid... You're my little guardian angel. We are honoured to present you with a world sensation for the very first time: the lady with hair of steel - Sabina! Mustn't be afraid... Mustn't be afraid... ’cos it may cost Mama her life. I don't want to live if Mama falls down. You're always clowning in my applause and falling on your arse! You steal my success! I can't steal that, Sabina! It's all yours! You were fantastic! I secretly counted the hairs that fell out. Loose hairs signal danger and whether Mama has gained weight, cos that could cause terrible trouble. I've been looking forward to your arrival! I can speak Hungarian at last! I'm from Cluj, too. So is half the world. Stay there and I'll film you. Good! Could you do the hand-kissing again? Sure. That's it. Great. Isn't that Sophia Loren? Sophia Loren! Mamma mia! Sabina! Look! Sophia Loren's here! Sophia Loren's here! But I'm Sophialoren! - I'll do it with fire today then! - Have you gone mad?! I can't allow it! And now comes the clown of clowns, David Larible! Ladies and gentlemen! I'm proud to present an artist from a famous circus family - Sabina, the lady with hair of steel! Won't shout. Won't scream. Won't yell. How do you do! The woman hanging by her hair was tremendous! Where do you go to school? Where do you go to school? I'm an artist. - What happened to your leg? - What happened to your leg? I fell from the Wire... when I was small. - She fell from the wire. - The wire? I was right. Is she your sister? - Come here... - Go on. Her name is Aglayasophialoren. What? What's your name? That's not Sophia Loren! Open up, police! That's them. The lady is from the Angels of Jesus Children's Home. You can get sent to prison in this country for not sending your kids to school. What? You can go to prison for making children work and keeping them out of school. Sabina, We're in big trouble! Calm down! - I'm their father. - What's going on? - The children must go to school. - They want to take our kids away. - Where to? - They're still so small! - I'm raising them as artists... - I can't help you... - Don't shout! - Enough! I'll lose my permit. If you work in this country, you must obey the law. If you don't like it, you can go back to Where you came from! They'll send you back to Romania! You bastards! If we don't obey, they'll send me to prison! Understand? They'll send us back to Romania! They'll hang me and you'll starve to death! Take everything I've got but leave my children be! I don't want to go without you! I'll come and fetch you soon, I promise! Which one should I pay off? Policeman or old bitch? Do you want us both to go to prison?! My children are international artists! Fuck the lot of you! Where's that fucking money? What d'you think I bought my act With? The whole lot? You gave her the whole lot? Be a good girl! I'll come for you soon... I promise! Mustn't cry, mustn't cry because it weakens the hair. Don't cry, don't cry because it weakens the hair. I'll get you back soon! I'll get you back! Attention! You'll find peace here. You can study and rest... as God intended! These two... are the lost souls rescued from the circus by our lady president! Come to me, my dears! You are so thin! We'll fatten you up! - What's your name? - Ana. We've already got an Ana. You can be Annie. And her? Aglaya. Aglaya? There's no such name! Who are you, the ice queen? You can be Gretchen. The name suits you. Start walking! To class! 1, 2... No one believed that my mother hung by her hair... they thought I made it up, because my mother wasn't in fact alive. I kept thinking about my mother's death so it wouldn't take me by surprise. Why aren't you in class? What do you look like? What's this? Children don't Wear lipstick! Remember this, Gretchen: Jesus Christ doesn't love those who want to stand out from the crowd! It's disgusting how they lick each other! There are 3 shows in the circus on Sundays. So what? Who cares? Quiet! They'll wake up! Come on! Come on! Sweetie... Listen to me! Your mother and I have divorced and We've shared you out. You're with Mama. I can't take you with me. Mama will come for you soon. My God, sweetie... HOW you've grown! Do you know where I wore these? At the Circus Festival in Monte Carlo. Did those holy Joes make you Wear men's shoes? Prince Albert was at the gala and he kissed my hand. If I'd been as old as you are now, I would have seduced him like you can't imagine! You'll never guess Where We're going. Go on... guess! Home... to Romania! Aren't you pleased? Aren't you my guardian angel anymore? But We're sentenced to death in Romania... Oh, sweetie! They've already executed the man who sentenced us. They shot him in a school yard with the lady boss. Like a dog... I waited for my mother for 7 years and 3 months. If she'd come earlier, I could have said it to the hour. She rambled on about her fame and success abroad. And all the places she'd like to hang from like Niagara Falls, between the twin towers in New York, from a helicopter... Shed hang from the sky itself if she could. Andre is waiting for us in the hotel. He's my manager now. Do you know what a manager is? I've missed you so much! You can't imagine! But what could I do? One can't just fly home from America! But you're still the most important thing in the world to me! You're the best! Do you know when it was best for me? When I convinced myself you were dead! And I cried for you... That was the best! The three of us will be happy together, you'll see. I felt just like I used to in the Home, that I don't exist... I'm not alive, that whoever was there instead of me, wasn't me because I don't exist. You were stunning in Manhattan. I'm so pleased you agreed to come! They'll take you onto the boat soon. I'll be on the raft. Water came pouring from the sky. God sent rain obviously to strengthen Mama's hair. Then the sun came out. I'm going to stand by the camera, OK? I'll Wait for you there! It's no good! Again! They didn't say what shot they Wanted! Once more! I don't need it! Take it away! Up! We're going UP! Crane. Hoist her up! We can shoot it again, if you insist. Again from the beginning! Fuck it, there's a power out! Do something! Her neck! Do something or she'll break her neck! For years I was terrified she was going to die. So when she was lying in a hospital bed, I felt really relieved. Everything will be fine. The dame doesn't feel a thing. Don't talk like that! We can push her around together. It would be better if you left. Move your fingers for me, Mama! See? They're moving! Get in! Go away! What? Get lost! For good! Just get lost! I'm so stupid! Stupid cow! And I thought he loved me! You should have seen him drive off in the car! What? He took it? He took the car? At least We're not stuck with him anymore. The filthy bastard! The jerk! I'll look after you now! He can drive his whores around! Like your father did! I still say your father bribed the crane driver! He's somewhere around here, I can feel it! He's gloating over me with his moist eyes. I miss Papa! I wish he was here! This'll be our new act! Voila! As soon as she got out of her wheelchair, we started going to casting calls. Mama knew Miss Pepita from Cluj. The star of the Romanian State Circus. Comrade Milo! Small World! What happened to your lovely hair, Sabina? She's very talented! We'll sign the girl up. Move around a bit, babe! A figure of 8! An 8 for the boys! Don't move from here, move from your muff! Give it to the men from here! Downwards... Radiate! Forward. Smile... Don't smile! Seduce! Now the other side... From here... Here. That's what earns the money! Don't drink! You know it's fattening. Everything that's good is fattening! And fattening up is good! It's a joy not to have to Watch my figure anymore! What a gift from God this is! All We've got is your glorious pussy hair! It's our only asset. Our daily bread. Praise the Lord for giving it to us! She's still a virgin. I see to it. I'll out your balls off if you dare touch her! Have you shaken the magician's hand? He's got huge hands! You know, it's important for men to be good and big down there! The main thing is it should be big! You have to shake a man's hand first! If he's got small hands you're in the shit! If he's got small feet too, you'd better forget it because it's just not worth it! Though some have big hands and no dick. I've been there! He'll never leave me! He's my husband. Herr Lili! No one else has got a husband with a tail as long as mine's got! Come on, don't stand around! The fact you owe 3 months' rent doesn't mean you can't sit down. I'll pay it, Lili. I just need a bit more time. Aglaya! Aglaya! Get in! Don't be scared! We'll go for a little drivel Mama Won't let me! She doesn't have to know everything! Come on! Milo just drove off with Aglaya. He screws little sluts like her in the Warehouse! You'd better hurry! Mary hates me. She's always watching me! I'd never perform naked like Mary! I'd rather die! You don't need to take your clothes off! Done anything like this before? Grab it! Go on! Do what you want with it! Put it in your mouth! I'll kill you, you bastard! I'll spill your blood, you fucker! You jealous? Do you want some too, sweetheart? Mama decided she'd had enough. We should do what we know best. We'll start a new life. She came up with the idea that she'd be my manager. We're travelling to Berlin. We heard Tandarica was there. We'll persuade him to help us. He is my father after all. He's spent his whole life falling on his arse! But he can do it better than anybody in the World! "Lullaby my baby..." Mama and I Watched you. Where's your famous Mama? The lady with hair of steel. Where? I saved her from "The Boss". I took her to the West. I invented a fantastic act for her. I financed her future, only for her to go off with that young shit! Do you know it's my birthday today? How many times have you watched that sentimental shit? I like it. It's good. Do you know how many TV channels want an interview? Don't tell me! - Well give an exclusive to RTL. - I'm not interested. Switch it off! That slush drives me crazy. - Better get ready! - Alright. Everyone's waiting for you. In Alexanderplatz people are drinking mulled wine, walking around, laughing... Just enjoying themselves. Everyone looks up to the sky, pointing. They're waiting for me... so the circus can begin at last. The TV people are here. Mama, don't leave me here! I just can't do this! You must be on your own now. You need to concentrate. I'm proud of you. And I envy you! Good afternoon... I'm reporting to you live from Alexanderplatz. The art of hair-hanging originated in China. You passed your fantastic act on to your daughter. You once had an accident during a performance. Could you tell us about it? No! I'd rather talk about my successes. Hello! If I could begin again, I'd do just the same thing... We're waiting here for Aglaya, the lady with hair of steel! Subrip by mitbrille Karagarga@2013
