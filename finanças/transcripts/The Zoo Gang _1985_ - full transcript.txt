Come on, Ricky, two feet on the floor, boy -(door knocking) -Katie? Where's (birds chirping) The Zoo? Damn it, we got their bus off the lot. The law says, all we have to do is get your home back on by 10 o'clock. And we've won. All we need is your motor home. You don't have to come with us. That's the most halfbaked, no brain idea I have ever heard. You people ain't ready for them. They gonna have your guts spilled out all over the streets and in the gutters out there. -Oh come on! Help us out. -You're crazy, man. We've only got like 18 minutes left. -What's wrong with you? -Hit me. -Do what? -I said hit me. I don't go around hitting freaking kids, boy move. If you can't hit a freaking kid, who can you hit? You want an invitation? Hit him. -Come on, hit him. -Would you hit him? Remember now, you asked for this, now. (groaning) You got lucky. Lucky, that's all. You ain't got no style. You're unorthodox. You're supposed to put your hip in it like I told you (determined music) Come on, let's run this old rusty bucket up that hill. Come on let's go. Come on! Let's go! Struggled with this long enough to regret it anyway Ten o'clock. (engine splutters) You lose weight, Val? You look like you lost weight. What's the punchline? No punchline, you just look good. Let's go! Ricky: Come on. Come on Come on, let's go! Can't this thing go any faster? Kate: Come on! Keep going! (apprehensive music) Ricky: its a whole army We'll take care of 'em, brother. Now as good as time as any to repay that little favor I owe you. Well, you go a little easy on him. Awful lot of peeping Toms around. Val: We're going back! Stop! Kate: Let's go! (all shouting) Just a little show of strength. (cigar pops) Kill 'em! Good one, Danny. Ricky: This is fun! Aw yeah, they're good boys. (tires screech) (laughing) Oh no! Wow! What's wrong? It's stuck! Let's move this thing, they're coming. I'm stuck! Can't you see that? Val: Danny, what are we gonna do?
