Oh no! No! Enough! Enough! Enough of these irrelevancies! We're not interested in the name of the writer or the script-girl. Send in the juvenile lead, would you. Ah... he was there. Ask him to come in. Is he the one who's supposed to love all the adorable creatures? He's a hit short in the leg for a Don Juan. He has soft eyes... Show us your profile, please. Nothing sensational... He may look better in evening dress. Still the same. Not much oomph. Let's have a look at his pecs. As I expected. You can get dressed. In short, we chose a boy not unlike any other. Tell me... what do you want out of fife? To be happy. Through work? No, to be happy in love. Oh, don't make me laugh! You can laugh. Do you know Catherine? Catherine? Yes. Her eyes, her mouth, her legs...! - Is that possible? - Oh yes! Anyway, you must excuse me... I'm marrying her at 11 o'clock. Bells, a red carpet, Mendelssohn's wedding march... Everyone remembers the day when, in the same way... full of delusions... We'll skip that. It’s a happy movie. Joyfulness gives André that stupid look of happy people. But Catherine is delightful Her eyes, her mouth... We'll leave her legs till later. Long live the newly-weds! Of course, the parents are teary... They weep as if their child was going to war. A nice little war between two, that will last their whole lives. Long live the newly-weds! - Catherine, I'm so happy! - Be careful of my dress! You know that a love like ours is rare. We've loved each other forever. Always have and always will I can tell you now... ...that I've never loved anyone but you, Oh, you liar! I swear. Altar, like everyone else, André! André, remember... Didn't you love your nanny? And Marguerite who lent you her roller skates, eh? And Francine? Have you forgotten her? You used to carry her class-hooks. It didn't stop you kissing her. Schoolboy love! And on the night after your matriculation... ...have you forgotten passing another exam? With distinction. Then you had to make a living. You've come up with these slogans, that are both poetic and profound. What will you produce for this brassiere... ...that's witty, unexpected, and snappy? How handsome the pensive man is! Come in! I've got an idea for the Sulca bra. - Let's see. - There. So here, in red, the Sulca logo... And here in black... "Choose the best... to hold your breast. " - That's cute. - Not bad, eh? A cigar? No, they make me cough. A delicate constitution! André, my dear, I'm very happy with you... It’s for you. Who's calling? Yes, it's me. Oh, it's you. How are you? No, I'm not cross. I just said how are you. When will the mock-ups be ready? I said when will the mock-ups be ready? What do you mean, I sound like Radio London? At 5 o'clock? Alright. At 5 sharp... My place. Alright... so that's it. A client. Of course! Is she married? Obviously! 5 o'clock... It's 10 to 5. Calm down. Clients are always half an hour late. - If you were in my place... - I wouldn't mind! Excuse me. Beautiful eyes, good-hearted... Shame it has to be a man! Hurry up! Every minute of delay is a piece of happiness lost forever. Quick! Christiane is capable of anything, even being on time. Nobody there! Your heart is beating like crazy... but that's love, André... to have a heart that heats faster. "We took the Bastille, that day we were bored... " "Let's dance the Capucine...” "There's some at the neighbour's house, but that's not for us... " Late, Christiane! Married women often have unexpected hitches that crop up. - That's my tartan! - What makes it "your" tartan?! Because I'm holding it! Sorry! A remainder sale. We all know that women can be extravagant. But they will gladly battle to make tiny savings... on purchases that are quite useless. - Christiane... - Hi, sweetie. You told me 5 o'clock sharp. I couldn't help it... Jacques asked me... I don't want to hear about your husband. - Take off your hat. - We don't have time. Just a sec... You're right... Life is too short Why didn't you come yesterday? It was Jacques's birthday. Yeah... Good Lord! What a hypocritical world we live in! But it seems that because it was his birthday... ...you're being sweet, tender.. Polite? - Is it just out of politeness that... - Don't be nasty! I realise you never want to be bored. But you'd agree that from time to time... We act like brother and sister. A brother and sister who could have children. I don't really know how it happened. If you knew Jacques... Stop talking to me about him. Besides, if I meet him... Don't be silly. We'll forget about Jacques, even if we talk about him. Cheated husbands still have... . an important place in the lives of their wives. Swear to me that we'll never split up. I have to be back by 7:30. Jacques has guests. I don't care. Me neither... ill 7. Even when I'm not with you, you're the only one that matters. Like my dress? - Watch out... Jacques...! - What about Jacques? Your whiskers scratched me. - Jacques will ask... - I don't care. Discretion and censorship oblige us to look away. A pity. A little patience... A little music. Honey-bunch... Happy? Yep. Do you love me? Yep. What is Honey-bunch thinking about? I'm thinking of taking you far away. Greece.. Italy... We have to get away. We really do. Together, discovering Athens, Rome... Get you away from having to lie. Me, lie? Not having to hide, I mean. Never having to leave each other. Only thinking about each other. Forget about time, appointments... - Oh, the dentist! - What about the dentist? - I had an appointment at 6:30. - You missed it - So you regret you're here? - But I don't know how to lie. This is the 3rd time I've forgotten. I just have so much to do. - What can I tell the dentist? - The truth, - Impossible. He's a friend. - All the more reason, - A friend of Jacques! - Oh, for heaven's sake! What's the time? 10 to 8. - My God! And Jacques who... - Oh, Jacques, Jacques... Enough! Quite enough! Don't be jealous, darling... You're the only one that matters. - Close your eyes. - So that's it. You're leaving me. I'm not leaving you, I'm just leaving. I hate to do I, but I have to. Close your eyes Tum around. What a lovely sense of propriety! A woman of tact knows just how to deceive her husband with decency. If Jacques knew that, he'd be quite happy. - Can I open my eyes now? -No. It's boring being alone in the dark. Think of me! - Where are you up to? - Putting my stockings on. That's proof you're leaving. OK, you can open your eyes. Don't feel so sorry for yourself, I'm the one who always has to do the leaving. You don't want to blame me?! There are things I have to do. And while you're doing them, I'm here, suffering. When you have to suffer, it's better to be alone. Alone...! When you're not here I'm alone. Whereas, you're with someone else! Now YOU are the one who's talking about him, - What if you told the truth? - I always do. - To your husband. - Never! I only tell YOU the truth. At the same time, we live a lie. I've had enough of it.. It can’t go on like this. You have to rearrange your life. You just need a little courage. That I have. Enough to tell... . Jacques? It's not only about Jacques, my darling. I also have 2 children. You don't start a new life with 2 children. I love you enough to allow your children to be mine. You know... That was a very moving thing to say. Look at me. You're crying? My love... Let me keep you all for myself. That would be wonderful. To be always with you... ...for the rest of my life. Oh... if it wasn't 8 o'clock... Hey! A winner! This is fun, eh? Watch this... - Where's Mummy? - She's at the dentist. - Is he going to hurt her? - No! He wouldn't do that... ...or she'd go to another dentist. Come on now... off to bed, kiddies! - Mr Girand is here. - Show him in. - Evening, old chap. - Evening, Etienne, Marguerite, get the whiskey. Oh, puff billiards... My favourite as a kid! Mine too. - Want a game? - Love to. -I'm lucky at this game - Me too. Lost if... Sir, the whisky bottle is empty. Already? Sorry? What do you mean by "already"? Nothing... I was just surprised. Really?! Surprised?! Maybe it was me who finished off your bottle of whisky? - Come now, Marguerite...! - There's some Cinzano. She can get so touchy! - Is yours like that? - Worse! - Do you yell at her? - No, it's because of Francoise. So, where's Francoise? At the hairdresser's. - And Christiane? - At the dentist. Tuesdays and Fridays. Oh... I couldn't find a taxi. - Good evening, Etienne. - Good evening, Christiane. Sweetie... Here's your shaving cream. - Oh, you darling! - Careful of my makeup. Your dentist seems to have left you a little damaged. Did you get your chin scraped? Don't worry.. it’s nothing. So, still in love? Christiane has never been the passionate type. In the beginning, a little bit. Love doesn't interest her very much, That's a bit like Francoise. Really? Cheers. Jacques, have you been rude to the maid? Me? Just ask Etienne. You've made some sort of remark. All I did was ask... Don't ask her anything, ever. Or she'll quit. You're going to have to find a way to apologise. Do you apologise to your maid? If it keeps Francoise happy. Don't get yourself 50 worked up, Marguerite! Men aren't worth it I brought you some material to make you a nice little skirt! Thank you, Ma’am. I'll get it. - I'm not too late? -No. Impossible to find a taxi when you want one. It depends on what part of town you're in. - Is Etienne here? - Yes, he's with Jacques. - May I? - Be my guest. So, what do you think? About what? My nose, of course... My new nose. Amazing! I didn't even notice. Was it painful? Torture! Women love to tell about the operations they have undergone. As though they were memories of war. When I had my appendix operation... That didn't compare! Francoise's nose-job is first-rate. The slope is always the same. The surgeon had to put me through one of those training sessions... It's part of his job. Doctors do understand us. If you ever needed to get a facelift... Thank you... there's nothing I need. That's lovely, what you're wearing. A Christmas present from Etienne. I was referring to your top. That's a lovely dress you're wearing. Where's it from? She's a little seamstress. This is a one-off design. - Where do I find her? - Impossible... I gave my word. I see. Your husband's secretary has one exactly the same. Though the dress certainly suits you much better. So, you know Monique? I've bumped into her twice, with Jacques... Purely by chance. With Jacques? Whereabouts? In a bar. But they were behaving very well. Otherwise I wouldn't have told you. You need to powder your nose. Why? Didn't your surgeon tell you? Noses like that go red in winter. Come on, sweetie. All alone, André was suffering... and thinking about Christiane made it so much worse. When solitude became too much for him... ...he went to seek refuge among his best friends. Conveniently, they lived on the same floor. Look who's here! - Can I have dinner with you guys? - Of course! But there's only soup and leftovers. I only want your company and your friendship. More pangs... ...of the heart? You can tell me all about it later. While you're waiting, help the kid with her homework. -Hi, Catherine. - Hi, André. - How's it going? - Badly... equations. - They're a cinch, - Well, I don't understand anything. Here... - Does it mean I'm stupid? - I don't think so, no. Neither do I. Am I pretty? Some day you certainly will be. - At least I think so. - So do I. Plus 2ab... A plus b squared... You like this record a lot, don't you? Which record? "The pleasure of love only lasts for a moment... " Could you hear it? listened to it 3 times. That's Dad. That's your answer, kiddo. Thank you... "Honey-bunch”, What? Isn't "Honey-hunch” a nice name? When I'm married, I'll give my husband cute little names. When you're married, you'll be busy with housework, like your mum, Cleaning, cooking... oh dear! Well... it is a pretty name... I'll let your husband know. - Evening, Daddy. - Evening, Cathy. Go and wash your hands. Good evening, old boy...! Dining with us? When love's a pleasure, WE never see you. When love's a pain, here you are! So, what's happening? I need some advice. I'm, at your service. May I? My feet are swelling... A new problem, So tell me. Edmond... I'm in love with a woman. Nothing new about that, - Passionately. - As it should be. So? I love her as nobody has ever loved before. So what's the problem? But she's married... with two children. I think it's my duty to find the husband and say something... Forget him. Pass me my old trousers. - And the children? - That doesn't bother me. I can raise them as if they were my own. Electricity's gone up 13 per cent and leeks have risen sharply. What's that got to do with it? Do you know the price of an exercise hook, or a pencil? No. So what? Pass me my slippers. Thank you, You're crazy if you want to get married. I love Christiane. - Believe me! - An aperitif? - That'd be nice. Getting married is a luxury. Madeleine is an angel. But even with an angel... I'm happier being in the office all day. This is the first evening in 3 weeks that I've had a moment to myself. This is his wife. Before 10 if possible? Alright then. So you see! - That was Mr... - I understood. Catherine, dinner's ready! You heard that? And you're unhappy with your lot? Don't complain! But there's another man in her bed! Christiane! You coming to bed? I want to sleep. Time to search your pockets, Jacques, old boy. She just found what she was looking for... your chequebook. The 1st... "MM, 50,000 Fr" No doubt her salary. The 11th, "MM, 50,000 Fr" That can't be salary. The 26th again, "MM, 75,000 Fr"! This is a love affair that's growing! Outraged, Christiane has decided to leave her husband. Put yourself in her place. What's she doing now? Ah, the chequebook! The revealing counterfoils. Jacques has been cheating. Fancy daring to do that to her! This way, he'll understand about what she knows, But she looks at Jacques in astonishment, She'd been believing that love held no interest for him. So much more dignified to leave like this. But it's a pity. But it's a shame. For once there were things they could have talked about. There's only one thing she wants to take... To wake him up. What's going on? I was going to take your photo with me. But my hand was shaking, and I dropped it. I'm sorry. Why do you want to take it? Where are you going? Don't know. Somewhere else... Far away.. What?! I could feel that something was going on, I'm not blind. You weren't the same anymore. Your indifference to me... Finally...! And to think you were the only one who meant anything to me! How foolish I was! I don't know what you're talking about. Monelle, Mariette, Marie Madeleine... It doesn't matter. But I swear... No, not that! Just let me quietly slip away. Don't ask me to accept any lies or any sharing. I swear on the heads of our children... You dare bring them into it?! I swear on my honour... I'm not the lover of any Marinette of whatever... - Those cheques? - What cheques? Congratulations! live with a detective now? What's your secretary's name? Miss Morin. So what? So far one "M". First name? Monique. - MM... That's does it. - So what? So what? MM... Monique Morin! That's what! MM... MM... MM... That stands for "moi-meme"... "myself". I've taken out money for you, for us, for the house. Come to bed, Sweetie Pie. What?! I love no one but you! And this afternoon, you said that to someone else. I still have my self-respect. I'm going home to Mummy. I'm only taking my toiletries. You can keep the rest for yourself. +Yes! Though... I shall take my fur coat. It gets so cold at night. Sweetie Pie... come to bed. - Never! - Sweetie Pie... - Come into my arms! - Don't touch me... ...with those hands that have stroked another. I could never let you! André goes to find Jacques, to reveal the situation. If there's going to be a brawl, well, that's how it will have to be. They can hate one another before they ever met. Mr Jacques Bertin? You must have passed him. He just went down. Come in... he'll be right back. He was expecting the husband to be more disagreeable... ...and the apartment not to be as nice. You! I'm here to tell your husband everything! - The maid will hear! - I don't give a damn! She's very sensitive, I've spent the night in a bed that reeked of your perfume. - Quiet! - ... be as loud as I like! We've nothing to hide! No matter what happens, I'm taking you with me. - Where to? - Greece. Italy... Everywhere. Listen, darling... Last night I learned something frightful, horrendous... Jacques has a mistress. Wonderful! Oh, thank you! Not one word of consolation? - That fixes everything. - Why? Jacques is a sentimentalist, He's capable of starting a new life. But darling... Having children means responsibilities. If this person imagines that I'll let her take over... ...my family home... ...with the big bathroom cupboard... No! No way! I'm not crazy. Yesterday you... Yesterday I knew nothing of this. So, some words were said. When we dreamed of discovering Greece together, that was just words?! Pretty words. So I meant nothing to you? You always have to exaggerate! Wasn't I... everything? Between everything and nothing... ...there are a lot of options. My darling, will you help me? I need you! So stay away. When I'm sure of Jacques... ...we'll get back together, when I'm back from my trip. - You're going away? - Just for 2 months. To where? Greece... and Italy... Who with? Sweetie Pie, come on... The car's here. In 2 minutes, you slip out, darling. Darling, would you come to the bathroom? Sure, "For always" does not mean “for all days". - Did you see Mr Bertin? - I'll come back in two months. Aren't you taking the lift? No, I have a delicate heart. Poor André, you expected to leave with Christiane and her two children... . and here you are alone. Such disappointments make one wish for death. We sympathise, old man, Of course, it's awful... it's horrible... But mostly, It’s funny. Thank God, you're not dead. You're already feeling better. Oh, to take girls dancing... Goodness, he's feeling MUCH better! - André! - Come on in! She wants you on the phone. Who? That one. She sounds nice. - You parents home? - They're in a bad mood... They found my private diary. This is terrible. Shocking! Horrible! And the spelling! Here he is, hang on. My apologies! Yes, I can hear you, - You go to your room! - Yes, Daddy dear. Darling, what a disaster! Aunt Berthe is sick! She in Paris to have an intestinal operation! Friday, I will arrange to be free to lunch.. ...at the 'Tour d'Argent'! I love you... kiss kiss! So, you're not going out anymore? Seems not. Sit down, Hang on to your hat, and listen to this... - You're going to read the diary? - Yes, our daughter's diary. I'll open at random... "February 3. I like running down the stairs. " "It's so nice to puff out my new little bosoms.” "Jenny doesn't have any, she always goes down in the it. " - So? - It's funny. He thinks it's funny. I'll find another one... "February 15. What attracts me to him... " "... his deep voice, or his sensual mouth?" "In the end I think it's his beard. " Gets funnier and funnier, eh? "April 19..." “After my course at the Museum of Man... " "... he invited me to go for a drive. " "I agreed on condition that Jenny come with us. " "It was divine. Like an affrodisiac. " Spelt with a double F! "April 26. Another drive, but without Jenny. " "That made it even better. " So? It wasn't right for you to read her diary. I'm wrong, he says! So, I have to tolerate this... every Thursday after the Museum of Man... Besides, what's the idea of young girls going to the Museum of Man! Museum of Man, Every Thursday, from 3 to 4. Frederic Michaud teaches anthropology to young ladies. School's out. These ladies do not want to miss a word from the teacher... ...the bearded seducer driving a sumptuous American car. Will Catherine hop onto the hack of his bike... ...for an aphrodisiac ride? Not likely. Apart from the beard, mentioned in her diary... ...all just poetic licence. Good afternoon. What are you doing here? I was just passing by... - You're not playing detective? -No. A you going to offer me a drink? "A drink" means alcohol. But I want to go to a real bar to have a real drinkie drink. I guess I could let you have a taste. Come on then. These ladies come here to kill time, when they've nothing better to do. - What would you like? - One tea, and one hot chocolate. A chocolate? Chocolate's for kids. What do you think you are? What do you think the others here take me for? - For your girlfriend? - Oh... Oh, I was forgetting! You like a woman of mature years. The one with that squeaky voice... She's an old woman. She's be at least... 257 And I'm being nice. Nice, hut precocious. A girl of my time! Everyone's not like you. People look at ME. - Who looks at you? - Men! In the street, at the cinema... If I wanted one, I wouldn't need to try very hard... ...to get an offer from an Eskimo? When I'm married, I'll have a car. I don't know how my husband will be, but I know that my car... will have big.. You still have a lot to learn. Not all that much. And this Thursday evening, Catherine, the dreamer, notes in her diary.. "Frederic's beard is ridiculous. " "I had a drink with André at Maxim's. " "It was very exciting, but what a stick-in-the-mud he is. " "Mud" with a double D. In this very elegant restaurant, with its splendid views... Janine had a date with André at 12. 30. It is now 1. 20 Surely because of Aunt Berthe's intestines. Such grotesque incidents can affect the most beautiful love affairs. Another Cinzano, Sir? Yes, it can't do more harm than the 4th one. Madam, Sir... Most honoured. A table for two? It can't be in a draught. - I prefer that one. - You'll be fine there. There! - No, that one. - That'll be even better. Take Madam's coat! - Will 1 be warm enough? - Yes, Madam. - Make sure there are no kitchen smells. - If you'd like to be seated... No, on second thought, I’d prefer that one. Phew, finally settled on a table. This seat is hard! A cushion for Madam. Quick! To have fluff going everywhere? As you wish, Madam, From the menu, there's Fillet of Sole, Duckling Tour d'Argent, Kidneys St-Louis... Give me curdled milk and brewer's yeast, - Brewers yeast at Tour d'Argent?! - So what? Incredible. Well then, give me some raw carrots and after, whatever you like. I recommend the turbot pie. Whatever you like. But without sauce. Gosh, it's cold here. Madam's coat... quickly! And for you, Sir? - Duck and champagne. - Monsieur is a connoisseur! You could have asked me what I wanted to drink, - You never drink. - That's no reason. It would have meant a little attention, to show your sensibility. Darling, when are we going to the ski resort? We're no longer going. Why not? How can you say that? Am I to endure all winter in Paris? Phone for Mr André Noblet. Mr André Noblet. - That's me. - There's a call for you, Here's your coat, Madam, Useless! We're suffocating here! Maître d'...! Things are still catastrophic! Aunt Bertha is even worse! I can't dine with you! I'll talk to you later. These gentlemen would also like to call, Alas, these ladies have only yet repeated the things they wish to say... ...a dozen times so far. Well, the table's been changed again. That woman has a thick skin. Your work... You only talk about work. Keep that for your wife, not for me. So, we're not going away?! You're giving me the shits. That's enough bad language! You'll regret saying that. This turbot smells of fish! Take Madam's fish away, quickly! Yes or no... Didn't you promise me that holiday? Yes or no? - Something else for Madame? - Nothing! Yes or no? Give me the check. But I haven't eaten! You're a total scumbag. Choose... The two of us leave nicely... ...or you'll live to regret it. - Minouche... - You'll see what will happen! Nothing will happen. Cloakroom! These little incidents are always amusing... ...when they happen at a nearby table. When embarrassed, men light a cigarette. Women powder their nose. How can George's departure bother Minouche? - Your check, Madam. - What check? - The gentleman asked for the check. - He left without paying?! Nice! - I never have money on me. - Tell the gentleman. See him again?! Don't make me laugh! I could be of help.. I never accept money from a man I don't know. Now that she's met André, Minouche has no more scruples. Blue would suit my complexion better, but the yellow is more chic. Unless the green... - Can you help me? - I'd say blue. But in the electric light... I'll take the three of them. I also need a scarf, mittens and a cap. Come this way... I hate shopping... It's exhausting. Oh, that's a fun outfit! - You have my size? - All sizes and colours. If you like it, I'll try it. So hard to find things that will please you men! I also need an anorak, apres-ski outfit and socks. She never has money on her. - Will you be on this train? - Yes, Sir. You'll bring me a hottie of cold champagne, dry. Is Minouche going to miss the train? There she is! All aboard! My luggage! Oh, I don't have any money. Give them a good tip. Is all my luggage here? I forgot my skis. You can buy me some there, - But this isn't a compartment for one! - There were none left,. It's very embarrassing for me. Oh, it smells of trains! Open the window. Is this your suitcase? I's taking up all the room, I'm right over the wheels. You get bumped all over the place. I'm sorry. If I could have done otherwise... Off you go, leave me alone. I’ll call you when I go to bed. A moment full of promise. Although Minouche was upset about the double berths... ...she seems to have got over it And now, she's getting ready. - Is it cool? - Just right. Minouche... You OK? Fine. Oh my God! All of a sudden, I got one of those migraines... My head is bursting. - A small glass of champagne? - No... Think of my liver. And as well, I'm cold, I'm shivering. -I give you my blanket. - And your pillow foo. You're not intending to undress, I hope?! Er, no.. Not at all, I feel so bad... I'll try to sleep. André, André my pet.. You don't want me too much, do you? No. Why? Hypocrite and liar! Be a sweetie and tum off the light, It hurts my eyes. The conductor spent the night dreaming of this passionate couple. Minouche slept very badly... She was too hot. And André didn't sleep at all... He was too cold. A happy departure for a holiday in the snowfields! Isn't the sun wonderful! It hurts my eyes. I'll buy some sunglasses. - How's your headache? - Gone! That's great. Hope it lasts. Be careful, it can be slippery. You OK, André? - Are you in pain, Sir? + Yes, my foot. Everything is planned for this kind of accident. My foot! - Can't you get up? - Not possible. Oh... André, I don't have money for the sled! From the terrace of the hotel, the view is wonderful. A number of guests can relax and enjoy it at the same time. The telescope lets you follow the exploits of those who are still standing. Oops, one less! Ah, there's Minouche! You fool! What an idiot! You should have watched where you were going! Evelyne! Minouche! - What are you doing here? - And you? With Marcel? - Finished. And George? - We split. Love your outfit! The cut of your pants is very good. Are you here on your own? No, I'm with Lebridel. The Cotons Lebridel?! But... the father or the son? The father! Much better. How about you? My fiancé, André Noblet, painter.. Gaston Lebridel. I like artists. They're necessary. Not that much, but you have to have them. - Wounded gloriously? - No, modestly. The suffering is the same. Whisky for everyone? - Not for you, my darling. - Just a small one? - An orange juice. - She's terrible! It's just that I love you. Oh, she's adorable! We laugh together... We've hit it off! Lebridel frolics with these ladies, without getting too tired. Lunch and dinner together... Jugged hare for everyone! - Not for you. - Oh, yes! - Noodles for you. - Oh, not noodles! - These holidays are wonderful! - No trouble, no quarrels. Just be patient, my pretty ones! André was getting impatient. With his twisted ankle and Minouche's migraines... ...things were not progressing. But men too have their little tricks up their sleeves. Minouche! Minouche! What is it now? You didn't do my bandage properly. - Have you touched it? -No. And you walk without a crutch... - The doctor said absolute rest. - For the ankle. But not for other things.. - Keep still! - Wait... It will make it easier for you... ...if I lie down. Your bed's so comfortable! André, you're a lot of trouble. Our engagement was going so nicely! Engagements are nice 50 long as they don't last too long. Your hand feels so soft! - It’s not too tight? - No, It’s fine. Minouche... Why are you so considerate with my foot... ...and so cruel with my heart? It's exciting to be kept on tenterhooks, just for a bit. Yes, for a bit. But not for too long. Look, André... I'd already be your mistress, if you didn't do so much to please me. So couldn't I do less to please you? Nope. Now go back to your room. The doctor has forbidden me to walk. If you don't get out of my bed... Here I am, and here I stay. - So I'll go and sleep in yours. - Minouche, if you do that... Open the door! Minouche! - Why won't you let me in? - Because I love you. They don't leave each other anymore. Oh, excuse me! Thanks.. - A little game without the ladies? - If you like. - Let me show you my jewellery. - I'd like that. - Is your foot any better? - A bit better, yes. The doctor is treating me with electricity. I go down to the village every day by sled. Quite a ride. The emerald set was a Christmas present. Wonderful! But emeralds bring had luck. People who don't have any, say that, How do you like rubies? No... I'm not crazy about them. The brooch was for New year. It has 186 diamonds. Really beautiful. Not too many? I could always remove some. How about this single diamond.. 10 carats! You have sensational jewellery... But for me, you can't heat furs. A mink coat... for any woman... - But I also have a platinum mink. - Women would envy you. But I must say... I'd rather have love. But Gaston adores me! Yes of course... But at his age... With André, it's something else! If I were to tell you about our nights together... Nights that go on all morning. All the time?! Like rabbits? Of you and I, I'm the happiest one. And believe me, the richest. What's Minouche trying to achieve with this lie? I don't really get it 5 o'clock. This is the time when our great lover.. ...goes down to the village to get his ankle electrified. André.. Since my accident with Minouche, my shoulder hurts. Gaston insists that I get an x-ray. - We'll go down together. - Take my arm. Lean on me. Evelyne and Minouche are such good friends... They'd never think of playing a dirty rick on one another. It's not very logical, but very feminine. These ladies wear only silk... ...but the Cotons interest them, Are you all alone?! Yes... all alone with an orange juice. Evelyne went down to the village. She has a sore arm. - Not serious, I hope? - Oh no. Take a seat. I feel a bit awkward... Evelyne not here... But I've time for a cup of tea. Great! How long have you known Evelyne? 3 years. She was a model with my couturier. - A model? - Didn't you know? - She was so pretty! - Oh, she still is! Yes... but you didn't know her before she went to Egypt. She went to Egypt?! Who with? With her mum. Such a deserving woman! ...and so happy to leave off being a concierge. Her mum was a concierge?! Yes, but a very good address! Can I get you something, Madam? Whisky. Get rid of that. Two whiskies. Oh, bravo! Doubles, eh?! This will be our little secret, Evelyne is so wrong to treat you... . as if you were some elderly gentleman. By the fifties... ... a man has reached full power. - Thank you! I am a bit outdated though. That's offset by your experience. What bothers me about André, is his youth, Can he ever understand me? Youth is so self-centred, And when I see you with Evelyne... - She adores you. - Did she tell you? As if you were her father. Should I marry André? Red is yes. Black! Do you believe in cards? Yes. Would you do the cards for me? Here?! Do you really think so? What would it look like? Some other time. And I will tell you the whole truth about Evelyne and you. Your hands must be frozen, They are, a bit. Do like me. Mine are hot. I didn't dare. Are you shy? - Do I scare you? - No... I'm not a vamp. Sometimes... I feel so alone. And so misunderstood. This way, it's much more fun to go to the doctor. When I walk with Gaston... ...it's not at all like it is with you. Evelyne's arm... Those adorable bones of Evelyne's... No fracture, but electrical treatment has been prescribed. When we're bored, we look for distractions. Minouche, my dear! This is Gaston! I want to see if André would like a game of chess. He's at the doctor's. It's so boring, alone. Would you like to come down to the bar? It bothers me, without Evelyne. Besides, I'm not dressed. I'll be ready in 15 minutes. Come on up. I'll read your cards... Right away! Funny way of getting dressed! At every age, it's the same thing. At the thought of the card reading, Lebridel is very excited. It's a beautiful thing, this cartomancy! Minouche! Minouche, it's me, Gaston! - Why don't you answer? - I'm in my bath! You told me 15 minutes. I fell asleep. Go on down. I'm happy to wait for you here. That'd be a bit embarrassing. Well, sit down and shuffle the cards. Did you find the pack of cards? Yes, I'm shuffling away, my dear! You know, it's... ...50 lovely, that sound of water. You're not allowed to listen. I'm getting out of the bath. I left my bathrobe in the bedroom, on the radiator. I'll pass it to you! Be discreet, I hate dubious situations. I see nothing, I hear nothing, I'm a block of stone. Give it to me. One more little secret between us. What exquisite tact you have! People can be so uncouth sometimes. You women can really put us to the test! What about the cards? If something good shall happen to me, you will tell me, won't you? Gaston, Evelyne is my friend. But less desirable than you! I'm André's fiancée. You do make things difficult for me. Why does friendship with a man have to be so impossible? Well.. ...just take a look at yourself in the mirror. You're just like all other men, But the thing is... ...I'm not like other women. I've never been able to put up with a man... ...who already has a wife or mistress... ...trying to court me That led you to getting engaged.. ...with some young fellow incapable of understanding you... ...and spoiling you. I've nothing to reproach André about. Nor do you, as far as Evelyne's concerned. So... ...friends? Of course! Feeling are as beautiful with you as the rest of you. That's André... And you here, me in my bathrobe... Hide! Quickly... there! A great trick.. The old man in the closet. - I'm really sorry about this. - It takes me back 20 years. 30 years! Is that you? Come in! - Not ready yet? - I've been playing patience. Any better? I have to continue the treatment for my foot. Evelyne does as well. Don't I get a kiss? 1 you like. You have red on your lips! Show me your handkerchief. I don't know where... You threw it away? We all know what that means. A you going to throw a jealous fit, Minouche? You're reproachful because I won't be your mistress. I don't reproach you for anything. André, I have the right to know the truth, We're still free. Tell me now. Between an old schmuck and a very pure fiancée... ...I wasn't having much fun. And a lovely woman has literally thrown herself into my arms. You cheated on me?! Impossible, we were covered in furs... ...like bears. It wasn't for lack of desire. And then? The furs came off, - And who is this woman? - Never mind that. But Lebridel will be lucky this winter. Oh... Evelyne?! I am so unhappy! Listen, Minouche, you're not going to make a drama out of it. Don't touch me with those hands that caressed another! I hate you! When you've calmed down... let me know. You said to me... "I've nothing to reproach André about. " "You've nothing to reproach Evelyne about. " I've trusted her. Minouche, my pet... don't cry, it breaks my heart, I'm aware of your delicacy. There are men who understand everything... ...can console everything. - Don't mention men to me again! - Oh, my little chickadee... I'm going to get lucky! Do you want your share of it? Mmm? Yes? I'm writing it down. The luggage from 25 goes to 347 Stay on the line. Noted, madam, The luggage from 34 goes down to 25. Urgent. - Partial rearrangement! - Poor things. Men are all the same... The pleasure stops, so they hop it... Peel the fruit and throw it away the skin, - Will we stay friends, Gaston? - Of course! - André, will we stay friends? - What a question! Everything that's happened is your fault. I've always had the best of intentions. Exactly Gaston! But promises on their own are not enough. In a love affair, there needs to he some loving, now and then. I hope you won't regret me too much. Mignonne! Everything that's happened is your fault. Wow! With your impatience, you ruined everything. Love isn't only about making love, Anyway, I forgive you, I hope you won't regret me too much... Goodbye. - Did you see Minouche? -- In the corridor. - No punch-ups? - We're women of the world, Evelyne, I adore you! You'll never regret it! Slow down, kiddo! You've already cost me dearly. And for something that didn't amount to much. Well, in a sled, in 10 degrees below zero... And then, the sort of men I like... ...are very tall, blond.. -. With blue eyes. - Blue? We women don't have time to lose, kiddo. Hello? I would like Paris, miss. Mr Percheron, There is father and son, I'd like to speak to the father. In between two affairs, a moment of respite is desirable. "Time to reflect, " say the poets. "Half-time, " say the athletes. André sees himself as a poet. Reflection. Yes? - Grub's ready! - OK! Quick... I've a 9am meeting with the big boss, with this flu, You should get more fresh air. You're always inside. - I have to pay the seamstress. - Again? It's for Catherine. Come in, André! You look great! - Hello... you OK, Edmond? +No one cares. - How are your feet? - Still swollen. And I've a cough. Shouldn't you be resting? Tell that to Catherine's seamstress. Where's Catherine? She has evening classes as well. She's studying for her final exam., - It makes you thirsty! - Motto, I'm broke! I'll pay... I sold my father's Tux. - And if he wants to wear it? - He never goes out anymore. OK then... Cinzano and rum! Crazy, eh? I've already received 3, 600, We have to choose 12 finalists. Have you seen these girls? None. The competition rules are strict... A photo only of the legs and no name on the back. Oh, these have verve... sensitivity, provocation...! - It'll be hard to choose twelve. - And after that, just one. - Who's on the jury? - The usual, The 12 finalists will show their legs. Only their legs. You'll give points from 0 to 20, depending on your preferences. The legs that get the most points will belong to the winner. She will receive from Chesterfield... 12 dozen pairs of Al stockings. Ali Superieur... Ali Francais... Stockings... stockings... stockings.. stockings! He's charming... Quite charming! - Who's that lady? - Don't know. - Do you know who that lady is? - No. She looks like Feuillere. - Better than her. - Don't be mean. That was for me to say. - This is a nice idea. - It's my colleague's. André Noblet. He has taste, imagination... I love artists. Isn't all this adorable? Amusing... very amusing! I'm a bit short-sighted. I'll get closer. I give them all 20. Number 3 reminds me of something. 20 for number 3 and zero for the others! Who are you voting for? In France, the vote is secret. It seems to me, my dear, that number... Don't get excited, Stephane. - What's going on? - There's an altercation... Young ladies... you're disqualified! Catherine?! I want an apology! She called me an ostrich! Because of her legs! Get back on your place! - Aren't you ashamed? - What? Look at my legs. - Out of here... go home! - Let me go! Fireman, help! Get dressed, now!! - How dare you treat me like this! - Do you know what happens in these contests? - Who organized it? -No one! Aren't I entitled to some silk stockings? Why not? For a single pair of nylons, there are girls who don't eat. And here, twelve dozen at once... Ten years of bliss! Would you deny me ten years of bliss? - You brute! - You want a slap? Quick, on stage... She's won the prize! - Me?! - She refuses it! - No way! - Catherine, stay here! No photos! Young student wins beautiful legs contest Her legs... her thighs... Shame and dishonour! While I'm killing myself at work... It all be forgotten by tomorrow. Disgusting people! They'll have her plastered up on walls! Where is she? The contest was to end with a big dinner. She's be there now. Madeleine and I don't deserve this. - She knows? - All of France knows! - Soup! - I'm not hungry. Hey, it's better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick! It's no joke! The fact that my daughter has done well... ...is all to my credit. I've got good legs, too. Look, André! Even with these stockings, not had., Catherine will give me some nylons. Only your husband better see them! - Maybe that was my mistake. - Madeleine! Where has it got me? To a kitchen, making soup and fretting about money. If Catherine's life is looking to be different... Don't say it. I want her independent. - In working and being honest! - Like you, huh? Look at him André... Worn out. He'll cough now.. And me without a decent dress, and I've never been away anywhere. I don't understand. My dear husband, have you ever asked me if I'm happy? Well, I've missed out on life, and Catherine is right! Madeleine! I forbid you! Long live freedom! You want soup... here's the howl! She's gone quite crazy! My beautiful smoking jacket...! Get yourself married... have children... There's the phone... Work never ends! Hang on. André... it's for you. - For once it's a man. -A man? André, you made a very strong impression on a member of the jury. The very elegant lady in grey. You don't know who she is? My dear, that's Denise Aubusson! Adorable, dazzling... Denise Aubusson was a widow. ...for the second time. Her first husband was an industrialist. Her second husband was a very big industrialist. The shareholders depart, but their shares remain, Denise devoted her life and fortune to the unfortunate. At the opera, gala for the benefit of the victims of the South. Sublime! What an interpretation! Bravo! Dinner for the benefit of the disaster victims of the North. Only a spoonful of caviar and a drop of champagne. The appetite of a bird! I'm like the poor... I don't eat much. A dance in honour of the orphans of France. - You're quite indefatigable! - It’s all for the unfortunate. The windows of her dwelling remained closed until noon. Exhausted by so much activity, Denise hired a secretary. Yes?! There are also chocolates and a basket of candied fruit. - For the kitchen, - They don't want any more! Take them to the primary school. Is he going to play that piano all day long? Before it was a sculptor, chipping away all day. - Hello, Alice! - Well rested, Ma'am? No, I danced too much last night. I continued to dance in my sleep. Should I talk to a doctor? But you look on top of the world, ma'am! Al ready for this afternoon? 10 tables for bridge and canasta, wasn't it? And only new cards. "Mrs Goulet", do you know her? She's the one always asking for money for the children. Yours, of course. On the other hand, there are letters from people who are really suffering. Send cheques, but tell me nothing, it hurts me too much. And let me know as soon as the masseur arrives! Oh no! By interrupting, you're offending Chopin. Chopin... I thought I recognized it. The theme is his... But I transpose! When I feel your hands on my shoulders, I transpose better. I would have liked to put myself at the service of great geniuses. I would've liked to compose, myself. But I never have time! But time to love me, Denise? Your hands are hot, Stephane. I love artists' hands. They're alive, they talk... To tell you how beautiful you are, sensitive, intelligent. Madam! What is it? What is it? Have him wait! Today, I'm hosting bridge for the benefit of deaf and dumb children. See you soon, darling. A social and charitable get-together. But even the pure of heart can sometimes be impatient. - Are you playing a club, Countess?! - Sorry, my mind was wandering. Of course... but it's the 3rd time it’s happened. Being charitable is OK, but not too much! Denise was distributing the good word, and provisioning the tables. Charity is not at odds with appetite. - Tea? Some pastries? - Just a little cream puff. Alice! The pastries, here, dear. Very well, Ma'am. That young woman you just spoke to... Her unfortunate occurrence... - ...hasn't bothered you? - Not at all! What occurrence? Well, I met Alice under circumstances that were rather strange. I feel uncomfortable talking about it myself. Alice, would you like to tell them? With the greatest of pleasure! Well, here we go. I was a thief. I was sentenced to 3 months prison. Mrs Aubusson took me into her service anyway. Thanks to her I reformed. Please God that I will never disappoint her. I've not forgotten anything? What sort of job has she entrusted you with? I'm her secretary, and I have the keys to her jewellery box, I'm always losing things. They're safe with her! - You've never found yourself tempted...? - No, Sir. - It must be tempting for... - A thief? Mrs Aubusson's trust has cured me. Isn't she charming!? Come on, keep serving cakes! I think if we all told thieves... "Come to my house and take everything you want" ...there's be no more thieves. - Everyone would be rich. Don't be cynical. I like to have clear consciences around me. I sleep much better! Madam, Mr André Noblet to see you. Oh, how nice of you to come! Ma'am, I only have a moment. I'm always in a hurry, harassed... Please do sit down. I'm organising a masquerade ball and I need a setting... a theme... ideas. Goon. I have a large villa in Cannes... facing the sea with the sun above. What can you do with that? Um... think about it. - And come back to me? Say... Monday? - Fine. No, let's make it Tuesday, 3.30... here. No, 11. 30... My car will pick you up. Give your address to my secretary. Alice! I have to leave you to it. So, until Wednesday? No... Tuesday. Yes... Tuesday, 3 o'clock. 1.30. I'm very happy to have met you. Really... very. Sorry to have abandoned you all! Is she always such a live-wire? There's so much misery to cope with, people to rescue. - And she happens to save some? - Me, for example! I was a thief who spent 3 months in prison, Despite that, Mrs Aubusson took me on, Thanks to her... You sound like you're reciting it. It is my act of contrition... because, besides, I was very proud. - Mrs. Aubusson taught me humility. - I'd understand if you reproached you. I'd have to be a monster to reproach her. I live at 17, rue Du Chevalier-de-La-Barre. So at 11.30 on Tuesday, the car will be there to pick you up. An impressive automobile with a matching chauffeur. Small details, but full of charm. This is exquisite, what refinement... But why a Directory-themed ball? I only thought about you... ...the character of your face. So I thought that it would be wonderful, The dress is very revealing. But with your shoulders...! Why are you laughing? I was thinking of a friend, Mrs. Pichon. Wonderful... That poor woman! If you want, I can... No, it's not an objection. Your idea is charming. There's a meeting to discuss designs... But it's no more than a pretext, to talk, to discover.. So many things in me have remained repressed. Maybe lost forever, not knowing how to make me happy. With my first husband, it was steel, always steel, With my second husband, oil, always oil. I never had a chance. My life passed me by. No more designs, and almost no piano. It's spring... A delightful spring that brings confidences to the fore. I'm going to ask you a ridiculous question. Are you free this evening? I have a concert for the benefit of goodness knows what... What a shame. I have 2 tickets for a boxing match. How disgusting! Perspiring men exchanging blows?! You've have stuck your fingernails into my hand. Really? Sorry! Sandwiches, get your sandwiches. Oh, I've injured you!... Forgive me. André... you have the hands of a great artist, For drawing brassieres. You should be painting... a great painting Sandwiches! André, something incredible is happening to me... I'm hungry. - You'd like a sandwich? +Yes. -Two. - What's in them? Ham. How much do I owe you? - We won't be poisoned? - I very much doubt it. It's good! What's happening to me? Nothing. For once you're like everyone else. Do you find me sophisticated? It’s starting again! I'm going for the redhead. Go, redhead! Bravo! And pow! It's wonderful! Stephane is worried. Denise is coming home later and later. ...and she's getting her migraines more and more often. Mrs Aubusson went to Pleyel? Sacred music. For the benefit of work on the archbishop's palace. - She's been gone 2 hours. - How time flies! At Rue Du Chevalier-de-la-Barre, the day has risen full of promise. The day has risen at Neuilly too. But Stephane finds it sinister... ...like the morning of a guillotining. There you are, Ma'am, Have you waited up for me? That wasn't necessary. - We were getting very worried. - There was no reason to be. After the concert I went to dinner at the Marcelin's, There, I had an excruciating migraine and I lay down. Take my jewellery and go to bed. - You don't want some aspirin? - What for? So? Bad migraine? Terrible, terrible migraine... ...without aspirin, Stephane is getting more and more worried. But he's not losing his appetite. Still in bed?! I was late, and so are you. And despite everything, you look fresh... And you're all yellow and puffy. - Don't I get a kiss? - No, I have face-cream on. You eat too much, Stephane. Always snacking... It's very bad for someone wanting to interpret Chopin. But the piano... it's exhausting! You're becoming too bourgeois. Sometimes I wonder if you're not too content here with me. Too content? To be a great artist, you have to know suffering. But I suffer, Denise dear. I do suffer. Not enough. I can tell what it is by your playing. It's wishy-washy, soulless, vulgar. - I'm tortured, torn apart...I - Not enough! My mission on earth is to make a genius of you! I'm going to go on a diet. That's insufficient. To awaken your soul... ...to rip sublime cries out of it.. ...requires hunger, cold... ...and being alone. Stephane, my wee Stephane... love you enough to sacrifice my happiness to your art. We must separate. How much rigmarole is needed to tell him she's sick of him and his piano? One love banishes another. One art banishes another. Enough with the music... Long live painting! Darling, I've brought you some porridge. - But goodness! Didn't you eat your egg? - No, not of a morning. Of course you must! Painting is very tiring. You're standing all the time. Denise, I think this is the first time that I'm really in love, And if I say the same thing... . will you believe me? With difficulty. - Who's there? - It's Alice! Come in! - It's Mrs Viturin. - No! - It's about the gala... - Take 10 tickets, 100 tickets... Excuse me. - Eat your egg and porridge. -No no no! But what do you want? You're terrible! Gala, a great gala, for the benefit of those who love each other. For 40 days, the normal duration of jaundice... ...André had not shown up at the office. What! You've had a relapse?! André, this is very worrying... ...repeated jaundice! Are you getting proper treatment? Rest assured, I'm being well looked after. No alcohol? Strictly forbidden? Very well, As soon as I get better, I'll be back in the office. Al the best to you, Ma'am. - Mrs Aubusson persists in going out? - She's ready now. Am I beautiful? I'll say you are! Stay home. - I Have to go to the opera. - It's terrible weather. A gala for the benefit of the Breton rescuers. They go out in any weather. We must do like them! - You'll wait up for me? - Need you ask? Let's see, honey, I'll go... I'll soon get bored and be right back. I'll do some drawing. Like to pose for me? It'd be the first time I ever modelled for anything! Just sit yourself down and don't move. So you were in a state home? 18 years. At Saint-Brieuc. Avery good place! People are prejudiced against them. But they are often annoyed by the very good people who put children there, My mother was a very good woman. Have you noticed my ankles? - Afterwards? - Still at Saint-Brieuc... I served in a grocery store, in the dairy section. You can guess what the bosses there asked me to do. Then I wanted to get away, to Paris. At Saint-Brieuc station there was a poster... Through the window of the restaurant car.. ...you could see the blue sea, white boats, palm trees... The poster said "Take the Blue Train" There are posters that shouldn't be seen... ...by everyone. I took the Blue Train. Before that, you'd stolen the money? - Yes, I had. - The outcome? 3 months, suspended sentence. The shopkeeper had withdrawn the complaint, for my beautiful eyes... If 1 may say. And Mrs Aubusson has swept you up. Yes, a thief instead of a nun... it was more amusing. - That's unfair. - I know. But to be good at charity, you have to know misery. - But she's bent over backwards for you. - Yes... It gives her vertigo. Mrs Aubusson knows your past. She even trusts you with her jewellery. If ever I was to steal one... Imagine Mrs Aubusson's reaction! Alice may have an excuse for taking the Blue Train... ...but she is wrong to be too interested in jewellery. No poster at Saint-Brieuc station says "Plunder your benefactor. " I've worked out the publicity and I've done some sketches just for fun. No... they're beautiful. - What time is it? -3.15, - I have to get away. - No, stay with me. I can't, That charity auction at the Duchess's. - Who gives a fuck about the Duchess!? - André! Some of your jests are shocking! After, would you like to go to dinner at your little bistro? Yes! What if the duchess found out? The Duchess can go fuck herself! -I pick you up at 7. - You're always late. I never know what time it is. Fetch me my bracelet watch. It's in the jewellery box. And ask Alice for my coat and my grey hat. Madam's coat and her grey hat. Let's dance the Capucine... Alice, dear, I have a mission to entrust you with, Certainly. André would like to know about my property in Cannes. - I've decided to send you down there... - To ventilate it? If you wish. I don't force you to do anything. I'm here to serve you, Ma'am. - You'll leave tomorrow night. - Your coat. Sorry, Darling.. can't find your bracelet watch. I put it in my jewellery box, Well, it's not there. Alice, where's my bracelet watch? Answer me! Have you taken it? Are you not going to reply? It doesn't matter at all, because I'm happy. Come on André. I'm not a thief. So, where's my bracelet watch? You'd left it lying around, Ma'am. Here it is. I'm so happy with your honesty that I'll give it to you. Anyway, since it's you I'm picking up, I shan't be late. See you later! Well? I never seen her be this happy. You have the bracelet watch... everybody's happy. I'm going away tomorrow. Going away?! Feel like a trip to Cannes. Cannes? I was sure of it, She invented this story.. She's afraid.. and she's jealous. Of who? How old are you? I'm 23. Why? Before I leave, I'll show you something. This. - What is it? - Mrs Aubusson's passport. -80? - Look. Look at her age. And all women cheat on their passports. Add 5 years. What's that to me? Oh, nothing. You're only as old as you look. But when a 23-year-old... Up to now, you've just been a petty thief. But now you're dishonest, And what you just did is disgusting. Quick, run and tell her! Adorable creature! For once, Denise is on time. What are you doing there? I was thinking about a disgusting thing I did. - You regret it, I hope. - No, I don't, Ma'am. - Where's André? - Gone out, I have to confess... Not now, Alice. He didn't leave a message? No, but I have to... You've stolen, I forgive you. You lied, I forgive you. -For once, I did not lie. + Bravo! And I told Mr André... . your age, Ma'am. You told him?! I showed him this old passport... ...that you foolishly left lying around. You did that?! Madam would be wrong to be angry, because she forgives me everything. Everything, yes. But not that. You're a piece of filth.. A little slut! Be careful, ma'am, suffering ages you. And you so love youth, and youth does well by you. Above all, no self-pity... That ruins everything, You have an hour to pack your bags and get out. And watch out! Don't panic... Above all, do NOT panic. Firstly, get rid of this. And now, call But where to find the number? Alice will be ready in an hour. Dial 12 for INFORMATION, Come in! Police. What do you want? What's this? Yours? It's a present from Mrs Aubusson. A present...? Another type of adorable creatures. She reassures herself in the mirror. She is still very beautiful. She's still very beautiful. But that doesn't mean a beautiful person, But let go of me... I tell you it's not true! This is your bracelet? She said you gave it to her. I did? Yes! She gave if... I haven't stolen anything! You were going off with it, eh? Officers, I don't have the reputation of being cruel to the unfortunate... But she's already had a suspended sentence. The inspector will decide what to do. - In my interest? - Exactly. Thank you, Madam. Don't forget... Tomorrow, you have the gala for the benefit of delinquent children, I won't forget. Come along! The little pest is carted off. She must be able to tell André everything right away. Otherwise it could be bothersome. You'd just left. I went to the office. The agency called me about a file that couldn't be found., Wasn't important. It was silly. I'm sorry. You want something to drink? No thanks. Darling... Is something bothering you? No, nothing. I was just annoyed about those papers that had disappeared. He said nothing. He doesn't want to talk about it Alice has won, Didn't something happen, before you went out? - Involving what? - Alice, Oh yes... that crazy story... But who fold you? Alice. What was the point? To harm us, Darling. I love you! Nothing else matters! So why did you tell me you went to the office? Where have you been? You will not believe me. I went for a walk. I believe it. And during those hours, ...your head spun about what you'd learned. You were nice to say it meant nothing. But the idea haunts you. - It's stupid. - That's how it is. Who cares about that passport?! A woman is still young at 40. We love each other, you're beautiful... Age hasn't affected your beauty. But it's not a question of MY age! Alice drew my attention to how YOUNG that YOU were. I wasn't thinking about it. You're 23... You could pass for 20, 18, 15, 12! It's not MY age that separates us. It's YOURS, my poor wee boy! Reflection, a new half-time, armistice. From time to time you have to empty your heart and empty your drawers. Come in! Good evening. You've changed your hairstyle? I turned 17 years last week and you didn't come. I'll have dinner at your place tonight. Dad's sick. Swollen feet? Yes. The doctor prescribed very expensive drugs. Mum would like you to lend her 10,000 francs. Really? Wait, I should have that on me. Poor Edmond! ...have to go see him, Thanks. See you, Landru! Hey... does she need a suitcase to go to the pharmacy? Ah, my boy... You have before you a man worn out by accounting. It's worse than alcohol and debauchery. - Get out to the countryside. - If only I could. How's your job? Tomorrow I'll be back at the agency. The concierge wants 1,000 francs that she lent to Catherine. Again?! I don't want anyone lending money to Catherine! I'm tired of this. - She's waiting. - Catherine scrounges off everyone. And the fools let her have it. Tell her it's the last time. Be warned, - Too late. - She got to you?! -10,000. -10,000 francs?! What was it for? Jenny, we have a news for you. Catherine and I are going to run off. We're in love! - First stop, Fontainebleau! - We can't wait! - What about your parents? - Screw them! We'll let them know, tomorrow. She's still a minor! So? Oh, she's 50 dumb! We'll write them a letter. Catherine, you're being really dumb! The new soup tureen is metal... ...and Madeleine will no longer avoid her destiny. If I can't work anymore, what will become of us? Catherine's no good at anything. She couldn't run a household. We need to Ge her married., Men are stupid, but finding one who'd marry Catherine... Oh, the phone... I'm not answering it. You go, Madeleine. I want to be left in peace. Yes? Hello Jenny. What? Who? Good God, that's not possible! - An accident? - Catherine and Bob, Edmond! What's happened? Your daughter's been kidnapped. That's the final blow! Thank you, Miss. At the Black Eagle, in Fontainebleau. Maybe you can catch them. With my feet the way they are? Well, better get ready for the christening. - You go to Fontainebleau. - Me?! Bob? Are you police? - Where's Catherine? - She just went upstairs. - How old are you? - 20 and a half, And you want to get married? Me? I guess so. Catherine's not right for you. Why not? She's pretty. She doesn't know how to do anything. And she's lazy, a liar, easily bored, She'll ruin a husband, deceive him. Her father will hassle him. Catherine is hostile to marriage. Girls who want to marry, still want total freedom... No restrictions. And when the first kid appears, It’s nose to the grindstone. Do you know what the price of leeks is nowadays, or the cost of a pencil? - What are you talking about? - Get the hell out of here! But Catherine's waiting for me. Ready, Catherine? You're not feeling you may have been stupid? Come in, Darling! You?! I'm warning you, I'm waiting for someone. When he comes, he'll throw you out the window. Do you hear that old motor running? You recognize it? Bob! Catherine... Your nightie is transparent, Bob! Bob! He's gone back to Pars... Forgot his pyjamas. Did you send him away? Yes.. I just needed to tell him what an unbearable wife you would be. You beast! Your nightie is transparent, You brute! Catherine... You're going to get dressed, and come with me. - Never! - Do you want a spanking? - I despise you! - Just you wait and see... I never knew a man who was uglier, more stupid, more... Oh, Catherine... I've been in love with you for such a long time, I've been aware... but you didn't know that I was. What moves me about you, is your freshness and perfection. I want a house full of little Catherines just like you. I won't be like Mum, born to make soup. I want to live. Life and love are the same thing. You don't know anything about it. Trust me... With me, you'll never be bored. Ah, you thought you'd reached the end, My poor André... It has only just begun! Subtitles by FatPlank for KG
