How come? - See? - Not mine. - How much? - 4. I'll put it back on the shelf. - Why? - I don't know. You'll own up to it. I can't picture you without mischief. Leave him alone!. Say sorry!. - Do I have to explain? - No... Fired on disciplinary grounds to caution other employees. Notification to the District Attorney. It's the 3rd time this month. No attorney if you forgo your paycheck. - How do I pay the rent? - You need no apartment. Make do under the bridge. Decide!. Isn't she my ex? The witch always knows when I arrive here. Go!. To our supermarkets with human faces!. How much for him under the counter? - What he wanted: 50,000. - I know. - Dollars or euros? - Zloties. You prefer to be paid in hard currency? My lawyer will change your dollars into our zloties. - Ours? - Yes, ours. - Congratulations. - Thanks. Thanks... thanks. Where will you move? Got a place? I don't know. I thought I'd move in with you. My room's no more. I'm staying with a friend. Come along with me. I can't afford the cheapest ticket. Why? They keep firing me here. Why should lreland be different? Before she died, Mom told me I can't face up to reality. What do you mean? You must live. I don't have to. We won't see each other for long... If at all. Exactly. If at all. Something's changed? How can I love someone who doesn't care? - But I do. - Words... When it comes to deeds, I may surprise you some day. Not those again! That's all right. You didn't complain. And neither did l. What's in your pocket? Take it out. Fifty thousand. Under the counter. - I know everything. - I can return them. No need. What else is on offer? - Only gays left. - You don't like them... I hate them; homophobe that I am. Order one of them, then. There must be a punishment. Boss mustn't be cheated. Remember me telling you the First Commandment? Thou shalt have none other gods before Me. No other god, but me. Change the name. - Angelo is out of date now. - It's an alias, but I can change it. No. It reminds me that everyone was an angel once. No visiting during the service. I'm not visiting. Confession? At your service. When was the last time you confessed? - Very long ago. - How long? It's a long story. I studied philosophy... I just can't afford a postage stamp. I have no other way. Could you send it, Father? In a few days if I don't come back. You mistake the church for a post office. I mistake a lot of things. They call such loonies. Suits me to a T. Hey, Uncle! Not too much relaxed? - Just the way you hate? - Exactly. Angelo! Penalty kick. You're not there. This is a sign. Don't blame yourself for anything. I've had it. Why am I saying all this? I've written all of it. Is everything all right? Yes, yes... Slowly. Not violently. I got a pacemaker. God! Dammit. It's got stuck. A miraculous repentance. The pacemaker's not working. Call an ambulance. Lives? Yeah. I should've tied my hands. I just thought the backpack would be enough. It doesn't look good. He has to undergo lots of additional examinations. A change of the pacemaker is not enough. I can afford... everything. What do you mean? A good question. I can afford anything in the material and moral sense. I wouldn't like to be in your shoes, if something happened to me. - You're threatening me? - No!... Not at all. I'm warning you. There are patients... that better go unharmed. I warned you that the way you live... I certainly won't change it... I'm interested in your motive. Was it you first suicide attempt? I bet my friends to walk the bridge banister... You have many friends? No. About a girl... A girl walked out on you and you wanted to punish her. Not quite. Good. We'll keep you under observation. We have ways to make you unlearn such suicide attempts. Only the amount tallies. - What do you mean? - All counterfeit. - Who gave it to you? - No matter. It's not worth talking about. They must be destroyed. I'm breaking the law by not notifying... You've broken it once, you'll do it again. Excuse me, could you give me one? - I'm penniless. - Here. Thank you. Only one. In fact, I don't smoke. I'd just like to try once. Is it worth it? There must be something to it. So many can't live without smoking. Others can't live smoking. More... more... Faster... faster... Do you know how they treat suicides here? - Is that your inclination? - An inclination? No. A resolution. You don't like life? No! Why don't you draw on it? - Pleasant, no? - No. And the other...? Sex? It's pure physiology. That's enough. And love? I wonder if people can be loved for real? Cats or dogs? Yes. Do you keep a dog or a cat? I don't. No more. I don't have anything at all. So you're a free man. I am. So what of it? He at least has had everything already. You envy him, but I don't. Listen up! Here comes aid! Why have you given them? Some will be happy and others will get collared. - It's OK? - Sure. They're freeloaders. - Don't you pity them? - No. They quite well-off. The true poor live under the bridge. Sir... It's worse than could've been expected. Your heart is a ruin. You could just as well live without it. - Only a transplant. - Let's do it at once. Not so quick. You need a donor. Not just any donor. Your doctor can explain it to you. - Blood type, etc. - I'll pay. Money doesn't matter here. You can't buy a heart in China, because it's too far away. The transplant has to be made four hours after the removal. I'll fly to China if need be. You mustn't fly! You must be ready and wait for a heart... on a rainy day, for instance. An icy road, or a weekend when they party. This hasn't been so simple for some time. - Why? - I'm afraid to be charged with killing a donor for the transplant. - I'm accountable for that. What do I do? - Nothing. Just wait, available by phone, or stay in hospital. I'll think about it. You're in such a good health that many could envy you. - Don't waste it. - Should I promise it to you? - Yourself rather. - That's all right. You wrote no address. Anywhere you can go to? No. You have any idea? I don't know. How about a homeless shelter? Just for starters... Where do I find a donor? You can hire Afghan to off someone. Then an investigation. Forensics... You need the consent of the donor in writing. - It can always be forged. - Not always. It's good to have a donor with all his examinations. What examinations? I need a donor immediately. Find someone who'll make the grade. How do you take him to hospital, then? - Best after an accident or... - Or what? A suicide. Angelo... To the hospital in a flash. A young man in the psychiatrist ward who tried to drown himself. Go! - And what? - Do I have to explain? You can take them if you want. - Excuse me. - Yes? What time does the next train leave? Early in the morning. Let's see. This is it, but it doesn't stop here, unfortunately. That's all right. I'll dictate. You'd better write the last will yourself. - I don't know how to write it. - No matter. It's whom you bequeath all of it to. Not to whom but for what? For what, then? How to hurt the world the worst if I die? - Terrorism. Al Qaeda. - Nonsense. They have oil money. So much! Genetic engineering. Cloning may destroy mankind, but it doesn't have to. Sects? No. Narcotics? That's what makes money. Why a bequest, then? Deconstruction. What's that? TRUTH DOES NOT EXlST Man is a machine. The botanical model of human schizo SPlRlTUAL WORLD lS AN lLLUSlON -... is rhizome. - Warm. DEVALUATlON OF VALUES We examine traces and doubt what a given trace is a trace of. Subject. DECONSTRUCTlON - A quasi-religious illusion. - That's the ticket! We'll give them grants, scholarships... If they string the youth along, mankind won't pull itself together. What about that doctor? Do we off him if the operation fails. You threatened him with Afghan. No. Do nothing. If he sends me to hereafter, let him send others too. - Is this just? - Yes, the way I see it. Yes? Yes, sir? You've released the patient who wanted to drown himself? How do you know he did? Please. You have such thoughts too? Do you know where he went? Must be to a homeless shelter. That's what he said leaving. You have his examinations? Here they are. No more. Everything gets lost here. It surprisingly tallies: the same blood type, his state of health and age. Don't gab. Say clearly: yes or no. - Is he suitable or not? - He is. Why wait? Drive to the shelter. Can't he? Excuse me. Avoid such violent movements. - Shut up or I'll let you have it. - No alcohol either. - It's you! - What do you want? Four are in jail! Order! Leave him alone! You saw a young boy who wanted to drown himself? No questions here. Keep your mouth shut. There was a young guy who asked about a train and left. No counterfeits this time. Run! Catch him! She's been coming here for days. Wants to talk to you. Show her in. Let her talk. You still count that I'll change and give you money for the homeless? I just thought that at such a moment you'd like to reconcile with those you've harmed. I've come to forgive you. No regrets wrecking so much all along? - What? - Other people lives. - Even your own. - I've only ruined my heart. Pity. You used to have a heart as the great outdoors. - That's what you think? - That's why I loved you. - You'll get a check for that. - No, don't. You shouldn't do it. Cash it after I'm gone. Thanks. Thanks, darling. Don't forget to say good bye to Mom. Why, she hardly remembers anything. - Bye. - Bye. If you've given anything, we must deduct it from the other donations. No need. It's a dud check. Fine words butter no parsnips. You son of a...! Back! It's him. Get in. Don't be afraid. It makes no difference to him. He has nowhere to go. A fleabag hotel. I'll text you the address. We'll drive you to a hotel. What for? I don't know. You got to be somewhere. - But I don't want to. - That's the point. We want to help you. Don't you see you can't manage by yourself? - So you stick to your plan. - Call me Stefan. The more I think of you, the more I see that you're right. About what? That life's pointless. The world is mean and stupid. There is no God. Never was. Good and evil are one and the same. So life's not worth living. Yet you live. Yeah. Do you call it living? I don't. How can I help you? Do you have a wish that still keeps you going? Or you want to help someone? Just the cats and dogs that suffer in the shelter. Consider it done. Is there anything else? - No. - You don't know how to kill yourself. Two attempts already. Right. I fail at everything. Even at that. I heard of a clinic in Zurich, where they help people kill themselves. Why not at home? I know you're pressed for time. I'm pressed for nothing. I've sent some farewell letters, though. I'm not telling you: See you, 'cause we'll never meet again. There's no eternal life. Are you sure? If I thought otherwise, I'd change all my life. Luckily, I don't have to. The hotel is ready. - What about the weapon? - It's clean. Stolen, that is. - And the ambulance? - Around the corner. So it'll look like an accident. Who calls the police? The hotel the moment the body is removed. - I beg you - don't. - Give it back. He must sign a statement he agrees to donate his organs. People are scared of transplants. Let's go. Someone left this letter for this lady, since he couldn't afford a postage stamp. But she's left. It may be important, as the young man looked deeply disturbed. I'll try to get in touch with her. Godspeed. Mama! My heartfelt greeting. Are we meeting on earth or in heaven already? No, you won't get to heaven so easily. - What has brought you, kitten? - Give me your blessing. - Going to murder someone? - They may murder me. Don't do it to me by going first. - Why? - I hate going to funerals. Give me your blessing. - You believe it'll help. - It won't harm me at least. Then it's worth it. When all is unknown, everything's worth doing. - Put your hand on my head. - Let me concentrate... - Is this enough? - I hope it'll help me. I remember you putting your hand on Father's head... -... when he went to the war. - And he didn't return. But the rascal saved his skin. By the way... If this is the last time, I must reveal a terrible secret to you. The one you thought your father wasn't. I couldn't tell you before, given the times we lived in. I got you three certificates of baptism. Catholic in one, Orthodox in another, and distantly related to a countess in the third, as I hadn't foreseen the commie Poland. I don't want you to die unaware of the truth. Or you could've seen it in a soap, huh? Could be. The last one. They show so many of them that they make you confused. Back her up! Oh, it's you. Come in. Nothing's changed, Mr. Stefan? Nothing, Mr. Angel. That's good. Here. Sign this. It's a formality. Why should I donate my organs? - Let them burn the body. - You can prolong someone's life. - Why prolong? - If someone wanted... - I wouldn't hesitate. - Sign it, then. Of course. They say in for a penny, in for a pound... I wondered if a noose wouldn't be better. But we have a pistol. You have any wishes? I was thinking of sending some emails. Of course. - But I got no computer. - No problem. - A laptop immediately! - Where from? I don't know. Immediately! You wanted to take a shower. Now before they bring a laptop. I don't know if I really wanted it? Wash up before they do it in hospital. In hospital? They wash the body in the morgue. Their custom. I don't know why. - Hello. - Hello. Your luggage. Put the cell away. - Can't I answer it? - You'll call back later. Hi! What? Keep the letter or throw it away. Or open up and read it. He's unpredictable... I'm going back. Of course! My luggage! Excuse me. - Excuse me, my ticket? - No reimbursement. I can't afford a train ticket home. Next please. Here you are. It's working. No need to get dressed. How would I look, then? I can show you how it works. When the emails are over, you'll shoot. Not at the heart, but at the head. What's the difference? You ever seen it done this way? It's always either this or that way. - Where should I've seen it? - In the movies. Leave me alone now, please. I must concentrate. You'll return after you hear a shot. Lock the door, so that no one disturbs me. Who's this farewell letter to? I don't know. To the world. Anyone can read it if he wants to. If we gave for a ticket, we wouldn't afford the soup. You can have soup. And then hitchhike. Could I use your laptop? Thank you. The phone, please. And get me my son. It's me. Am I disturbing you? - Standing in the shower? - Not standing, but lying. Alone? No. I found your heart trouble on the cards now. I have a trouble of the heart. Change something about your life! What's the matter? Let's wait. I've found out that my girl Malgorzata is looking for me. She can't find me. I've left no address. There's only one train. - What time does it come? - I don't know. Check in the Net. It's postponed. The donor's not ready. When do you think he will be? Not before the evening. You can have lunch. By the way. May I too? No way if the transplant is tonight. Are we going back? I'd like to see her. But you know women. They say this and do that... And think something else. No one knows... what they feel. Right you are. So we go back to the hotel and we do what you've decided? I'd wait till tomorrow. If this is no problem for someone to pay for my hotel room. Of course not. - Where from? - Warsaw. If she's hitchhiking? - What if she is? - Do I have to explain?! Weren't you supposed to fly to lreland today? What's it to you? I'm Stefan's friend... - if you know what I mean. - He's all right. Isn't he? Not quite. - But he's alive? - Yes. Been his friend for long? Longer than you can imagine. Get in, please. I know how you feel. It must be a real blow. To me too. Stefan cheated on both of us. He hid his true nature all his life. So did l. He was scared to admit we were a couple of gays. I hope you'll believe me. He lost, so we should let him go. You shouldn't have returned. That cheap line does not reimburse tickets. - I'll buy you another. - Why you? Two reasons. I still feel responsible for him... No matter. - And second? - You're my only chance. I've never wanted a woman. You rouse my true passion. To me? I'm with her at your residence. Drive him to the residence from the hotel. Say that I'm calling him. Make him wait next to the living room. When Angelo's number shows up on your cell, call him and open the door a crack. Go! - I call Angelo? - Stefan, stupid, to let him see something. What do I do here? - Wait? - Yes. I'll keep you company. Come. Does the CEO have something to tell me? I can't tell you anything now. Something warm? Please. Come. That's all I can show you. She hasn't come for you here as you see. Sex and money as usual. The CEO wanted you to see it with your own eyes. Sorry. I didn't want to scare you. My chauffeur may drive you to the airport to fly to Dublin. And Stefan? No use crying. Do something. Where is he? Better not see him now. He could even kill himself if he saw you. You'd better go. Someone will attend you. Drive the lady to the airport. I saw everything. - I know how you feel. - I feel nothing. I want it done and over with as fast as I can. - Now, at night? - Night's the right time for death. But not with a pistol. I'd rather jump from a height. There're no heights here. A string may be better. So be it. - But where do I do it? - Not here. I know a place. Let me make a call first. Where are you?! Seems it's going to happen right away. Please stand by, everybody. Understand? Don't let him break his backbone when he hangs. Just let him strangle himself. That's what I ordered. This is the place. I wonder why people tie their hands. Someone else always does it. They don't do it themselves. I can tie yours if you want. No. I remember that the condemned has the right to his last wish. You're not condemned, but a free man. All the same. Could you give me a cigarette...? - You don't smoke. - No, but I'd like to try. I don't get it what people see in it. Of course. I don't smoke, but I'll find a cigarette for you. We have time. Sit down. Have a rest. I'll be right back. Where are you and the ambulance? Haven't I given you the address? Men! Cigarettes! Gimme. I'll chuck it away. You could burn something. What's wrong with it? I want my body burned. You decide, of course. You jump, or I kick the stool? - I'll see. - Good. Attention. - One, two, three, yes? - Yes. Attention! One, two, three. Come on. You were supposed to help. And now? Let's get away. It's burning! Failure! Quick! To the car! Let's go! He hasn't backed out. Cool it. I have an idea. I get it. Three strikes and you're out. The heart must be here right away. Good, good, good. We'll do it simple. I'll drive from around the bend. You'll be standing here. hear rubber peeling... A moment and it's over. This won't get you into serious trouble. This will be all your fault, OK? What if I take his bike? Why a bike? It's easier... on a bike. Of course. Get his bike! - No, not this way. - Of course. Give him 100 euro. He'll be happy. I got only dollars. Here. So what? Let's not waste the day. Oh, no. I won't survive another day. - The ambulance ready? - Yes, it is. - The surgery ready? - Yes. We've got a heart. Another one. It's clinical death. Let nobody make me laugh. The doctors say, I'll faint if I laugh. We have new offers for supermarkets. Screw supermarkets. - Which? - All of them. Not now... Am I dreaming? No, you have Angelo's heart in your breast. Angelo didn't have a heart. This is for the animal shelter. Give them the check and say you want to work with them. But I am already. But gratis. They must give you a full time job. You got a girl? I used to. I remember ordering Angelo to try to lay her, but to no avail. Are you ready to forgive? Whom? Everybody: Me, Angelo, and the girl, who, out of pity, let him take her in, but wouldn't lay him after all. Was that so? And I thought that... Do you want to try with her again? But how? She's in lreland. You can take my plane. I thought you wouldn't make it. I have. And you want to work here? No, I'm taking you back to Poland. Do you care for me? Yes. You have a ticket for me? No. I have a plane. What? I regret it. We'll buy out all of you and put you out to pasture. You want a sip? I can't. I'm on immunosuppressors. - And still a kidney transplant. - Is it worth it? - Worth what? - Living. Yes, it's worth it. - For a rich man maybe. - What about you? Who wants to live under the bridge? - Only to do penance. - That's the point. I've done a lot of harm. Better do penance in this life than in the other. You believe in the hereafter? I don't have to. I know. I've been to the other side. Is she the one who sang at my party? That's right. How is it possible? Everyone can change. Not only you. Cast of Characters Subtitles by Jerzy Siemasz
