Today will be our third day in a row with at freezing temperatures. According to the National Weather Service, Seoul started off the morning at -14.5 degrees. Hey, Jang-sup! Chief MA's here! I told you to hurry just in case he came! And this time, it's the real deal... - What's this? - Hey! Come on. This one's for sure. So pay up first Shit, money first! Now! That social worker discovered the body. And JEONG Myung-sook has no family or friends. Hey, hurry and wrap things up! Hey, Chief, how's it going? Hey, this is my jurisdiction. What a die-hard. He's scouring every JEONG Myung-sook. Jeez. Here. It seems she's been dead for almost a month. (Basic living security recipient certificate: JEONG Myung-sook) No sign of trespassing, suicide pills or food... The only one that kept in touch with her was the social worker. She stated JEONG never interacted with neighbors... Seems like the old lady lived and died alone. I guess it's her this time. That JEONG Myung-sook. Hey, Miss BAEK! Miss BAEK! Finish this up, will you? You wanna mess your hands up? Just for a few more bucks? - Give it to me. - You should have gloves on. Hey, I got it! Shit, I can almost see your panties. Here, put it on. What for? With those rags, you'll freeze to death. I always wanted to shred that shit-colored vinyl jacket. I've been waiting for the right moment, but I won't. It doesn't look cool. Fuck cool for crying out loud... It's badly paid, and it's god damn frigid winter. Stop that car wash job before you freeze to death. Considering all those jobs you have, I can't believe you won't get yourself anything decent. Whatcha gonna do with all that cash? Use it as fucking wallpaper? Hey, Mr. Smartass. What the fuck? What? Your eyes tell me something's cooking. Your mother was found dead this morning. The exact cause of death was not known yet. We need to do an autopsy, but for now it looks like she died of lung cancer. She's been dead for a while. Should we cremate her? Well you're her guardian, right? Guardian... I... just wanted to see how she died. That's why I'm here. Do as you please. Jeez... You need to get a new car to catch the bad guys... Mom, you refused me a college education I desperately wanted. Then made me stay home and wash his stupid diapers. I hope you're satisfied from up there! That I'm a single old maid dealing with this kind of shit. She was married once. Hey, it didn't last long. Shut up, twerp... What's up with your hand? Did you arrest a criminal again? - My brother is a detective. - Shut up. Great detective of violent crimes section. Hey, Jang-sup. Are you still looking after that girl? You just never listen to me. I may be sick of washing your filthy undies, but how dare she! You're the only family I've got. A girl with no class or foundation... Who says I'm marrying her? She has no intention of marrying me. How come? She doesn't want you? Forget it... She must be kidding, for god's sake... Doesn't she know you're a detective? Not everyone can be one, with a sexy face like yours, and 6 feet tall - She doesn't deserve you. - Shit. She doesn't have a clue. How dare she... It tastes like shit. I can't believe this sells. - Are you coming? - Spit it out if you think it's shit! Guess what? This round, I bring something big! JEONG Myung-sook had a criminal record? The old lady was suspicious, anyway.. So, I looked into her information. She spent 6 years in a prison, and was released in 2007. Is it him? Seochang Construction's boy. Yeah, the asshole... He was your first suspect, right? JEONG Myung-sook hit that asshole with a car, to avenge BAEK Sang-ah's case. You fucking bitch! Chief, she's still in high school! She's clearly a rape victim, why can't she claim self-defense? She's just a punk who lived at an orphanage, while his dad is a Seochang Construction major stockholder, and his brother-in-law's an Uijeongbu District court judge. You think it'll be possible to indict him? Let's go. There she is! Protect her. Let's get married. I said, let's get married. Goddamn you. Didn't I tell you it's not in my fate to be anyone's wife or mom? Say it twice more and it'll be the 470th time. Hey, what's that? Huh? Are you really leaving for Jeju Island? Without even discussing it with me? I'm asking you! What am I to you? Don't I mean anything to you? Jang-sup. The more you get involved, the worse your life will get. I don't deserve married life. So just go find a girl good for you. What am I supposed to do? What should I do to get you out of this life? Why don't you stop?! I feel suffocated by the look you give me. That pathetic, apologetic face you send at me For the rest of my life? Fuck no! And didn't I tell you not to look for that woman? What were you expecting? Shit, I'm sorry that I did, goddamn it! I'm fucking sorry! You might be a fucking bitch, But I thought you would forgive her seeing your mom died that miserably. Fuck you! What the fuck do you know?! That woman would drink herself sick and beat me like crazy. And even that wasn't enough so she abandoned me. That goddamn memory! That held me back and messed up my life. You were there to see it! What, forgive her? This is it. Stop butting into my life. I'm begging you. She must've starved the kid. - Is that her mom? - I don't know. Don't stare at them. I'm sorry... Ma'am... Don't call me that. Missus... Hey. Stop being an ass-kisser and finish your meal. Miss BAEK. That's what you call me. For fuck's sake, what am I doing? I'm KIM Ji-eun. Nine years old... By the way, how come you're barely covered every time I see you? What about your mom and dad? My dad... he's the only one in home. Did your dad do that to you? Whatever. What do I care? Shit... Ji-eun. Why are you here at this hour? Sis... Hi there. I was passing by and I was sure it was her. She's yours? Well, not quite. She's got weak metabolism and should watch what she eats. But now she came out and acts like she's starving to everyone . Sorry for this, sis. I'll pay for it. KIM Ji-eun? Give her back her clothes. KIM Ji-eun? Let us pray. In hopes of being filled with the Holy Spirit. Oh Lord... Let us pray Oh Lord... Look here! Her dad's an alcoholic going through rehab. If you just cut off child support, then how are we to raise the kid? No, you don't need to know who I am. Hey, get it there. Hey, JOO! What brings you here at this hour? Sis... She's not my kid. It's none of my business. It's nothing like that. I just don't want you to get the wrong idea. Actually, my boyfriend had her with his ex when he was 20. I just took her under my wing. I didn't even know he had a kid. I thought he would wake up and get a job, right? But when this kept on for years. I couldn't take it anymore and thought of leaving, but... we just physically grew on each other Sometimes you feel like leaving your own kid. So how do you think it feels raising someone else's kid, right? Joy! Did you eat, huh? How've you been? This is why a dog's better than a human being. KIM Il-gon. The state cut off your kid's child support. I can't believe I'm still in this shithole. Whatcha looking at? I said, whatcha looking at?! What... You think I'm easy? Hey. Tell me, You think I'm easy! Just looking at your face disgusts me. How do you do? How do you do? Come in, please... Well.. You must be shaken up after being questioned at the Nambu Precinct. Sorry to bother you again on the phone... It's okay. But to be the first to find her... It's tough. Her last image lingered on for days. It was hard. And I keep remembering the things she used to tell me.. When Mrs Jeong lost her husband and suffered from severe depression, She would beat her daughter whenever she got drunk. So she blamed herself for ruining her daughter's life. She was haunted by the memory for the rest of her life. (Death Certificate) You're her guardian. She beats you? Tell me. JOO Mi-gyeong did this to you?! No... That chicken, there! This, that and that. What the hell am I doing? Just finish it. Where were you planning to go? I was just hungry. They don't seem to feed you, do they at least give you money? After they beat me, they give me money. Does anyone know about this? Get up. What? They, the police... They send me back home. Ma'am. You need to slow down on the disciplining. Make sure this doesn't happen again. I'm sorry. Hey, KIM Il-gon. Don't you know I am going through all kinds of troubles to feed the fucking girl you have popped out, huh?! Miss BAEK, is it done? Look, it's still dirty. Huh? Here and there. There are still stains. Oh, okay. Sorry. It's my bad. Okay? By the way, is there anywhere else you can go? What was I thinking, goddamn it... - Goddamn it. - Hey! I wasn't cursing at you. I was cursing at myself. Miss BAEK. Do you hate yourself? If you don't have a place to go... Is there anywhere you want to go? (Nice place to take a kid) Thank you. About your mom, do you know where she is? Heaven. Heaven... Anywhere there's no daddy and me, she said is heaven. Miss BAEK, where's your mom? She's in hell, my mom. Hell... Run from me... as far as you can. Get up. Let's go home. Didn't I tell you not to wander around? Come here! What the fuck are you doing? What are you doing? That's a good boy! Sis... What the fuck are you doing? You... - If you lay a finger on her... - What do you mean? Who? Me? Is that what you told her? Don't. Hey, who are you to interfere with my life? You're nothing but a measly masseuse! If you're not up to the responsibility, stop meddling in my business. I'm sure you've never even raised a dog. If you really want to have her, then how about $100 grand? Then take her at the price of $100 grand. You fucking bitch! KIM Ji-eun. Didn't I tell you to stop biting your nails? She has a habit of biting her nails. And how did this wound happen? I fell down. By myself... Stay here. The next door lady said she never heard a child crying... And since it's winter vacation, it'll be weird to ask her school. But I told you I'm a witness! It'll be a headache if anything goes wrong. We have no concrete proof for now. I know the law, but it's hard to pass any judgments right now. Come on, even the kid is denying everything. Don't make this a big deal What about her taking our kid without our consent? Also causing disturbance at our home? Shouldn't you include housebreaking and assault as well as personal attack? By the way, what's your relationship to the child? Can you show me any identification? If you don't have any on you, write your ID number here. (BAEK SANG-AH) Chief. Look... BAEK Sang-ah. You have a criminal record in ‘99. What is it? Are you okay? I'm with the Joongbu Precinct. What is it? How could they beat such a small child? The Children's Crisis Center told me they'll visit her soon. so let's see how things go. - Where is the kid? - Over there, sir. It's been 4 days, since he's been buried. The kid's father and father's girlfriend confessed to the murder. So, are you just going to look away? Her nails are falling out and she's all black and blue! Visiting her home just won't do, damn it! Excuse me? They don't have a slot for her at the center and they promised to visit her regularly... Right. For someone's who's never owned a dog... I must've been possessed. I shouldn't have interfered. The kid is fine. Day after tomorrow? Okay, please come. KIM Il-gon. The center people are visiting, so keep an eye on her. Until they leave, don't touch her, okay? It'll be a headache if they find a new bruise. Are you feeling sick? Let's get you into warm clothes. Oh, it's cold. Shit! Miss BAEK... Miss BAEK! Hey. Baeky! I can't believe you're spacing out in front of cash? Here! I threw in your severance pay as well. It'll be hard to find another employee like you, Baeky. But you've got Jang-mi. Who, me? What about me? What? I knew something smelled fishy. Are you moving in together with Jang-sup? Huh? If not, then are you pregnant? I'm late. Joy's here. He had to get away from daddy, my precious Joy. I though Il-gon became calm, but I guess not. KIM Il-gon goes batshit crazy when he's drunk, and it drives me crazy. I'll be back in a jiffy. Thanks for looking after him. - See ya. - Okay. What happened? Something happen between you two? Don't drink it. It'll only keep you alive. Stop it. Daddy... Forgive me... It irritates me... That crying... I said stop! Hey. What's the use of living like this? Just... Just fucking die... That'll be better, right? For us both, right? Shit! I told her no! Why the fuck were you born?! I wish you were dead... I'm sorry for being born... (JOO MI-GYEONG) Hey, are you with another bitch? KIM Ji-eun! Ji-eun... KIM Ji-eun! (JANG-SUP) Miss BAEK... Miss BAEK... I placed your mother's ashes in the charnel house today. She's in a good place, so don't worry. You know... - Your mom... - Later Not now, but later. Okay. We'll talk later. Miss BAEK... Wait. What? Stop the car. Why? Something's wrong, isn't there? Is it the kid? Hey! Stop the car! Hey! Hey, BAEK Sang-ah! Hey, you better watch out! The number you have dialed is not available at the moment. Now, let me see. It stings, right? This'll be quick. You poor thing. Jeez, what happened? You're her guardian, right? Follow me and fill out a form. Let's go... I'm sorry. 326-41... 326-41... Open up! I'm a cop. Open up! I know you're in there. Awe, shit! Someone's inside, right? How should I know? Huh? A woman was calling the girl, pressing the doorbell like crazy! When was that? Did you get to see the woman? Hey! Open the goddamn door! Open it! Hey! Why didn't you open the door! You know who I am, don't you? Hey, what the fuck? Hey! Where's the kid? KIM Il-gon. Didn't you understand what I said? If we're caught again, we're both fucked. So I told you to keep an eye on her, you fucking moron! Excuse me, boss. You know who lives in JOHYUN villa, don't you? Or, did you see someone visited at #204? Hey, stop, stop, stop! God... For crying out loud... Rewind it again. Look. We are the same. I'm... not educated enough to teach you anything. And I've got nothing... So I've got nothing to give . But... I'll stay by your side. I'll protect you. I'll protect you too. Excuse me... but in the ER tonight, was there a kid this big and... (BAEK SANG-AH) (BAEK SANG-AH) What is it that you want? Do you want to raise her? 8 years ago, in my mailbox I found an envelope with a savings account book. I felt so embarrassed. My house entrance she passed through was narrow and filthy. The mailbox she stuck the envelope in was covered in rust. It was so embarrassing. So... Your mother let you go to save you. She said that day, was a day she never forgot. I guess it haunted her until the day she died. Doctor! Doctor! Help... Help, please help... Arrest me. Ma'am, what's the matter? - Arrest me - Excuse me? Arrest me. Don't let me near my kid, please. - Arrest me, please... - What happened? Let go, let me go! - Let go! Arrest me! - Ma'am, snap out of it! Don't let me near my kid! (Lost children center) Run from me... As far as you can. I'll take your picture! Mom... Can a person like me... Is it okay for me to be a mom? (Years sentenced for child abuse) Hey, KIM Il-gon... Did you know? I thought she'd be better off dead... The cover up would be a drag, but I thought it would make you come around. A kid, I could always give birth to one... Anyway, listen carefully. If you don't want us rotting away in prison, we have to move first before center people come. Why's he acting weird? Didn't you say that woman had a criminal record? Huh? I mean my girlfriend went on a business trip to countryside, I never told her because she will worry about it. My child is missing. I don't get why people have been bothering me since last night?! I can't work for crying out loud! You said a cop dropped by to check the CCTV footage, right? The cop took it with him! What was on it? The masseuse girl slipped into the alley holding the kid and disappeared that way. The kid seemed hurt bad since she wasn't moving. You know, she had a criminal record. What's going on? Once she's identified as the one who took the kid, then file a report. That she's been kidnapped. This happened here before with a lady going crazy over finding the kid. - Yeah? - Yes. But it doesn't look like a place where a kid's been living. How does your daughter spend her time playing? Well, she's always home, so... How tall is she? Her height... About this tall? What was she wearing when she disappeared? I'm not sure... Did you do a background check on her? What? Attempted murder? The woman who came to ER... We got a report from here. Is this her? I found her! The time's around 22:36. Hey, BAEK Sang-ah! Pick up the phone. You'll be arrested, if you run away with the kid. I'm going there right now, so sit and wait. Okay? What's going on? Sorry, but breakfast's not ready yet. Oh my, and there's a child. I'm so sorry. Yes, see you again. Done. I'll go to your place to look for evidence, so promise to explain things well to the cops, okay? Good. - What should I do... - Get her some food. And stop making a fuss. I guess she needs to eat. Have you ever tried eel stew before? Should I fry the eel? Jang-sup! Yeah, I guess you need to find a way to happiness together. Her father's filed charges for kidnapping. So we need proof that she's escaped from getting beaten. I'll go look for one. So don't think of going anywhere and just stay right here, okay? Where's your phone? Turn yours off and have mine. I'll call you this way. So whether we find a solution, let's see what we can do. Since she's recognized as an abused child once she enters the Children's Crisis Center, they won't easily hand her over to an ex-convict. Right... What's this about? Nothing. Okay, thank you. Hey, hey! You son of a bitch. What, kidnapped? You're saying she's been kidnapped? - What's going on? - Where the hell is she? Drop the charges, now! Or else you and that bitch will regret you're alive. What's all the commotion? Is there a fight? The child on the 2nd floor has disappeared. The 2nd floor? You mean the kid hanging from the window yesterday? I drank too much and called a chauffeur service yesterday. And... I saw a kid dangling from the 2nd floor. I thought I was hallucinating... What do you mean a kid was hanging... - Here, here, rewind! - I'm watching it! What's this? She wasn't kidnapped, goddamn it! - Police? - We are doomed. Cut it! (KIM IL-GON) Sis... - Something wrong? - Shut up! Just shut the fuck up! I just knew she'd drag me down one day. From the day I laid eyes on her, she was bad luck. Without her, KIM Il-gon wouldn't have become so fucked up. Without her, my life wouldn't have been so desperate. If we get rid of her, no need to worry about evidence, right? 35-year-old Park was sentenced 7 years for child abuse resulting in death. The court found PARK guilty of all charges, but considered he was a first time offender and expressing deep remorse for his crimes. But when the sentence became public... He should've received the death penalty. That it was outrageous to apply death by abuse. Fucking unbelievable... As horrible as it is, nothing can cut family ties except death. I guess you really like her. It's not your fault. If there is one, it's just that you two aren't related. Hello? - Hello. - Welcome! - Hey, what brings you here? - Ah, okay! - Hey, no! I need to be in there! - I know! What a stubborn fuck... What's with him? It's not even his case. I don't know. Hey, where is JOO Mi-gyeong? Huh? Do you even know what your crime is? Do you? You and that bitch made it a habit of beating her with coat hangers, broom sticks. In winter, got her wet and froze her in the laundry room! Hey, look at me! This is what you did to your own kid! Look hard! Hey, Jang-sup! Let him talk. Just let him talk! Whatcha looking at?! Go! Just fuckin go! Hey, let me ask you this. Isn't she your own kid? Even if it just happened, isn't she your own kid?! Did you really mean to kill her? Did you? Huh? She didn't die, did she? Let go, get out! I was beaten as a kid, but did I end up dead? Where were you all when I needed help? So lay off you sons-of-bitches! Get out. Get out, out! Get up. You know... After growing up around this shit, it's unlikely her life's gonna turn out great, right? (YOO JANG-MI) Just hang up if I'm not answering, jeez... Hello?! Hello? Isn't this Jang-sup's number? Who's this? Miss BAEK... Miss BAEK! She's coming, just wait! Hello? Hello. He told me you run a diner. I'd like to visit your place. Where's it located? Something for a cold, please. The kind for kids. What're the symptoms? Stuffy nose? Sore throat? Fever and coughing... Next news. 2pm, today, Joongbu Precinct arrested KIM for imprisonment, starvation and battery of his daughter, while putting out an immediate APB on KIM's girlfriend, JOO. Didn't I say the kid's okay? How many times do you have to check? But isn't this supposed to be harboring a suspect? Check to see if anything's wrong. I want to be paid four times the regular. Check her out! Damn... Welcome. Welcome. - Have a seat over here. - Hello. Miss BAEK... Uh, sis, how've you been? What brings you here, officer BAE? Jang-sup wanted me to check something? Jang-sup? But he already stopped by. Uh, yeah? There's something else. Uh, but no one's here. - What? That's not right. - No one's here. Goodness gracious, where is she? Goddamn it! Didn't I tell you to keep an eye on her?! Shit! - Jang-sup, where you going? - Did you locate JOO Mi-gyeong? - Her location? - JOO Mi-gyeong! - Why are you.. - Goddamn it... Where are you? Kid! The kid disappeared! (DET. KANG) After hanging around with her, you've gotten bad. Get out of my life! Miss BAEK! KIM Ji-eun. If you take another step further I promise I'll never see you again. Calm down and speak slowly. You think I can calm down? Do not just telling me that you're running away.. Give me the address you're at now. - Address? - Yes the address. Do I look like I have the time? Get my address yourselves! It's hard to find.. - Hey! Do your work right! - We need your address.. Hey, get up. Hey. Bring it on. I said, bring it on! Hey. What were you gonna do with the kid? Were you really thinking of killing her? You want to take her under your wing, right? Yeah, at first I wished her dead. But not anymore. She physically grew on me as I beat her. If you're thinking of taking her in, I'm sorry. I'm not letting her go. I'm keep her for good. You'll see. You fucking bitch! Let go, you fucking bitch! Let go! Ji-eun! You think you're better than me?! Ji-eun! Why are you here? Get in the car, quick! It's freezing outside. Get in the car. What is it? Hey, BAEK Sang-ah! Let go! - Let go! Let go of me! - Stop, stop it! - I said, let go! - Stop! Let go! Let me go! - BAEK Sang-ah! - Let go! Hey, just stop, will you?! Are you hurt? The car's over there. And the kid. I'll take care of things here. Here... You don't want her to see you handcuffed, do you? I'm sorry... Just go and be her mom. Even if it's just for a few days. Go, now! Hurry and go! Even if I'm like this... Will you come with me? Let's go... together... (1 year later) Abused for 3 years, JOO was sentenced 15 years for child abuse and attempted murder KIM's father, 30-year-old, was sentenced 10 years by the court.. Good morning. Breakfast is ready. The court found JOO and KIM's guilty of all charges for several years of child abuse. Turn it off. Come here. Come eat. Ma'am, don't you see that ‘No Smoking' sign? Ma'am! Don't call her like that.
