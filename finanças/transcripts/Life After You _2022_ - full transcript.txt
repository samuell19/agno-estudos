Mm. Mm. You sleep good last night? You know I did. Mm-hmm. Don't forget to put the hamper in the laundry room. Got a mountain of dirty clothes I gotta do when I get home tonight. I'll give you dirty. Dejame! You'll mess up my make up! Mm. This is disgusting. Is that your mess in the TV room? What? The TV room. Looks like a bomb went off in there. Yeah, I was gonna clean it up. Uh-huh. Doug and I were playing Call of Duty. I heard. His mom kick him out again? Mm, yeah, something like that. Someone should have called Child Protective Services on that woman years ago. You tell that boy he's welcome here any time. Will do. I'm glad we can talk about anything. Hey, you're my buddy. New band? Yeah. Ugh. Ugh! When was the last time you washed that disgusting thing? Recently. Can you just let me throw it away, please? No, no, I love this hoodie. Well, then at least put in the laundry. You look like a hobo. Okay. God, that's beautiful. It's better with this. C'mon, live a little. Go on. Oh... How could something so bad feel so good? Just the way it works. ...Can I get you to eat? Mm... Uh... blueberry pancakes? I don't have blueberries, and I don't have time to make you pancakes. Oh, I'm sorry, Your Highness. Don't let it happen again. I'm gonna go take a nap. You're gonna take a nap? At 7:30 in the morning? Don't you have a class at 9:00? I do. I'm gonna take a cat nap. I meant what I said. Grades go down, car's not around. What am I, a broken record over here? Kind of. Well, good. Maybe this time, you'll listen. You're not going to work at Pasta Palace the rest of your life, are you? Don't know, Tito! Can't throw a football, but I sure can sling spaghetti on the wall. Very funny. Any you guys see where my money clip is? Isn't it in the dish on top of your dresser? I thought that's where I put it. Oh, here. Here. Thank you. Why do you taste like an ashtray? I have no idea. Yeah, we're gonna have to talk about this later over my knee. Promise? Come on, guys, gross. And as for your butt, get your ass to class, mister, pronto! - You hear me? - Sir, yes sir! Yeah. Ham or PB&J? What kind of ham? The usual. Jelly? Kumquat. Kumquat? I thought it sounded interesting. Jelly. Love you, guys. I'll see you tonight. Yooo, busted! It's all your fault. I didn't do nothing. You always do nothing. Hm. Hey, Sally! Thanks again for hosting last weekend. Oh! Our house is your house! Ted drank too much, but what else is new? So did I. Don't tell anyone. You know your secret's safe with me. We're having a get together at the end of the month if you and Tito are around. Just close friends and family. What's the occasion? Greg got into Penn State! He did? Oh! For finance, just like his father! Oh, well, congratulations. You must be so proud! We are! And Danny's still going to B.C.C.? Uh, for now. He's been looking at some more prominent colleges. R.I.T maybe or Cornell. He wants to get his feet wet first. You know, figure out what he... what he really wants to do before diving in head first. I think it's a very mature decision. I agree. Well, I'll get you the date and time of the party as we get closer. Okay, great. Have a wonderful day. You too. - Hey. - Hey! Good news, Pops! Kelly's got her book club meeting tonight, so... Esta noche el partidito! Partidito? Partidazo! Si, si, senores! Yo soy de Boca! Yo soy de Boca! Yo soy de Boca! Mr. Bill Cunningham, what's going on? - What's up? - Hey. What are you two so excited about? Oh, big football game in Argentina tonight. I think you mean soccer. Football, soccer... it's the greatest game on earth. What's wrong with you? Greatest game on Earth is when Mikey was playing real football for us. Hey, I think you're doing okay without me, coach. Yeah, we're holding the flame. How's it going, Tito? Eh, same old, same old, except... I'm expecting to become a granddad! Oh, yeah? Boy or girl? We're waiting to see. Good for you. Time sure flies, huh? Yep. - Hello. - Hey. Just seeing how you're holding up. Considering I've worked 48 days straight, pretty good. Make sure you're eating and getting enough sleep. Yes, mom. How's everything going with you? Good. Just doing some grocery shopping. What's wrong? Nothing. You sound tired. Danny stayed up late playing Call of Duty. Didn't he have class this morning? Yes. Uh, then why is he up late playing video games? He's 19, Anna. He's an adult. So maybe he should act like one! You're too soft on him. You let him get away with shit that would never fly with Mikey and me. I gotta go, Mom. I'll call you later. Colleen. Hey. Why are you waiting in the cold? I tried knocking; no one's coming to the door. You never have to knock. Come inside. Yeah! Turn that down! Si, mi amour! Look. Oh, my God. It's so cool. Can I come? You better. Linda, is Danny here? He's not picking up his phone. That's weird. I tried texting him all day too, and he hasn't answered. Danny, are you in there? Danny? You want me to try again? Yeah. Hey, Danny, open the door! Tito! Yo soy de Boca! Tito! Chile, cero. Danny? Yo soy de Boca! Danny? He's not answering the door. Door's locked. Get out of the way. Danny! Oh, he's not even in here. Oh, what's that smell? Geez! God! No! My little guy, my little guy. No. Dad! Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Pull him out! Call 911! Oh, my God. Now! Go! Breathe! Breathe, breathe, God, damn it! Baby, don't do this to me. Breathe! Breathe! Breathe! Breathe! Breathe! Breathe! Breathe! Breathe! Breathe! Breathe! Breathe! Breathe! Breathe! Breathe! Danny's dead. Wake him up. Tito, Linda. Um... Do either of you know his passwords? We used to. He changed them a few months back. We wanted to give him his privacy. Listen. The coroner is here. We're going to need to do an autopsy to determine the cause of death. A list of his friends? Yeah. Just, you know, take your time. Um... Uh... I know he was with Doug Whitmore last night. I... I don't know. I'm sorry. It's all right. It's okay. That's all right. - It is. - I know. I know. He's such a good kid. It doesn't make any sense. - Glad you could stop by. - So sorry about your loss. A little. I cannot. I couldn't. Oh, my gosh, I'd love... He was such a good kid. Yeah, man. Ah What should I say? I don't know. Can we just have someone else do it? Like who? Mom and Dad? 19-year-old Daniel Lajterman was found dead in his bedroom early last night from an apparent drug overdose. This police department will be working with the DOJ to determine the source of these drugs. We have no suspects at this time. Tonight, bitter winds return with lows in... People have been stopping by all day. The fridge is full of food. Mike and Kelly went home. They'll be back in the morning. I think I'm going to stay in my old room for a while. Where's your mother? She's been in your room sleeping all day. That's good. She needs the rest. We have to make decisions, Papa. Are we gonna bury him? I will not put my son in the ground! I'm sorry. We're still gonna have a funeral. He needs something to wear. It's 4:00. May I start letting people in? Yes. - I just wanna ask you something. - Sure. Did any of you guys find a watch up in Danny's room? No. Is one missing? No. Hi. How can we help you? Uh... I was wondering if you might have an Omega Seamaster from the '40s? It's kind of a vintage watch. No, I'm sorry, we haven't had anything like that come into the shop. Are you sure you want me to send this? They said you can take as much time as you need. Your mother and I are going to take care of the monthly payments. But the gas is on you. Mm-hmm. Doug said they're hiring at Pasta Palace. He can probably get me a gig. A's and B's; you start slipping into C's, we're gonna have a problem. Let's put this way: Grades go down, car's not around. You hear me? Repeat it. Grades come down. Time to go to town. - Stop clowning around! - Hey! Repeat after your father. Grades go down, car's not around. - Okay. - What are you doing? Writing a contract. I... solemnly... swear... One less 'n', wise guy. - Mm-hmm. - Yes? I solemnly swear to do better in school, and if I don't, Tito can have the car back. Bill. Amazing, I... I just finished your plaque this morning. Tito... Nancy and I saw on the news. I'm sorry. Nancy bought you a pie. Thank you. Thanks. It's gonna be okay. I mean, what doesn't kill us makes us stronger, right? You hungry? We were supposed to go fishing at Mawapi Lake last week, and he stood me up twice. I should have known something was up. It was his favorite place in the world. It's not your fault. You should answer it. Hey, what's up, babe? Why didn't you tell me? I wanted to. I don't know. I... I was afraid that he would break up with me if I did. There's this... house for sale over on Church Street. Had this open house a few months ago, and Danny pretended we were interested. The agent didn't buy it for a second but, you know, Danny could get people to do pretty much anything he wanted. She gave us this tour. Five... Six, seven, eight... He talked about all the ways that we were gonna decorate. I mean, we both knew that it was all a joke, but somehow, it also felt, like, totally real. Let's go. Daddy, where are you? Not too hot or too cold. I don't wanna ever be that happy again. I'm gonna be the mermaid. Hello? Mm, something smells good! Pancakes? Oh! Well, all right! Yeah. I'll just... I'll set the table. Okay. I'll get the syrup. No, no, I'll get it. I'll get it. Okay. Um, Linda, Linda, what do you doing... babe, babe? It's okay. I'm so sorry. It's okay, sweetie. We'll just make more pancakes. We can't make more. I don't have any more blueberries. We'll just make plain. Plain pancakes. He didn't want plain. No, no, no. Here you are. Oh, thank you. Thanks again, Dr. King, for showing up on such short notice. You're welcome. - I really appreciate it. - Mm. No, I'm just glad that I had a break in my schedule. So do we want to start with, uh, what happened yesterday? It's okay, um, we can start with how you've been sleeping. Not good. Linda? We've both been having a hard time. Okay. It's, uh... It's important for you to take care of yourselves. So I'm going to prescribe you both a sleep aid. No drugs. I'm sorry? It could help. I don't wanna sleep. How about if I write you the prescription, and if you decide not to fill it, it's up to you, but it's there if you need it? Okay. I like your stickers. Sorry. Who put those there? Uh... My daughter. How old is she? Seven. We got into his email and his social media accounts, but we're still locked out of his phone. What's that video? Click on that. I want his friends here tomorrow. I want to know what the hell is going on. Mom... Mom... Where are you? Warmer... Warmer... Hey. Want to get out of here? You might want to think about staying on the road there, slick. Oh! Mm-hmm. Where are we going? You'll see. It would be better with this. Mmm? Come on. Live a little. Come on. Mm. Mm. Mm. See? Isn't this nice? I'm so mad at you. I know. How could you do something so stupid? That's what kids do, Mom. Don't give me that crap. You're smarter than that. Apparently not. One day, it was just there, and I thought, "It can't be worse than how I feel now." So I tried some. And it felt amazing. The universe opened up, and I was finally part of it. I felt so light. Like I floated up out of myself until I was way up there. And all the noise in my head just stopped. And there was this silence. I didn't have to think about everyone that went away to really great schools. Or how I came home smelling like a deep fryer every night. All that mattered was that feeling, and I'd do anything to find it again. And again. And again. Why didn't you tell me? I could have helped you. I wanted to tell you, Mom. But I wanted the drug more. Remember that one time he straightened his hair, and then he went to school with Colleen's headband? When he used to get on his tippy toes, and he'd do this crazy little, like, dance of his? Oh, my God, that was his signature move, man. Danny... told me... at Thanksgiving that he tried it with Doug. Doug? They got it from some kid at the Pasta Palace. I... I couldn't believe it. I told him he was stupid. He agreed with me. And when we got back from Christmas, we had an intervention. We were up all night with the two of them. Why didn't you tell any of us? They... they made us promise not to tell. We talked to them for, like, six hours straight. They said they'd never touch it again. He was your best friend. And you let him kill himself!? Tito! Get out! Go! You guys fucked up. This is all on you! Open up. We know you're home. We want to talk to your son, Mary. I wanna talk to Doug! No, I want these thugs off my property. - Uh-huh. - I'm filing a restraining order. I don't feel safe. I understand, Mrs. Whitmore. Well, she's filing a restraining order against you two. Doug and Danny were using together. Doug is one of the first kids I spoke to, but he wouldn't tell me anything because his mother's got him lawyered up the wazoo. Let me talk to him. It's not up to me. He will talk to me, Brian. Turning Point, how can I direct your call? Uh, hello, yes, I'd like to speak with Douglas Whitmore. Who can I say is calling? Linda Lajterman. One moment, please. Hello, Mrs. Lajterman? I'm unable to put your call through at this time. It's... it's very important. - I'll let Doug know you called. - No, please! He'll call you if and when he's ready; goodbye now. Let me speak to her. She hung up. Hello? Mrs. Lajterman? It's... Doug. Mr. Brennan, you are charged with first degree, strict liability for drug-induced death, second degree manslaughter, hindering apprehension, and tampering with evidence. How do you plea? Not guilty. Those aren't getting bought? I know they're not gonna... But that's... that's what they asked for. No, no, no, no, that's because of the... I'm gonna go to the shop. Do you want me to pick anything up on my way home? I'll, uh... This is my brother, Anthony. I'll call you later. And this is my brother, Adam. When I see a fixer-upper, I see dollar signs. Yes! Yeah. Looks like it came into us a couple of weeks ago by a Daniel Lajterman. Do you still have it? Actually sold it the next day. Can you tell me who you sold it to? I... I can't tell you that. Come on, man. Not for free. I hope you're hungry. Oh, that smells amazing! I put some chili peppers in there - to give it an extra kick! - Oh... Where's Anna? Oh, she just texted me. She got caught up at work. Mm-hmm. Well, anyway, I don't know about you guys, but I'm starving. Oh! Are you okay? Baby's really acting up today. I'm okay. ♪ I'm gonna be a granddad ♪ Here. Hand me your plate. Isn't he handsome? Ted and Sally must be over the moon. I heard it was the most competitive year on record. Linda! It's so good to see you! Is... is Tito here too? Would you like a drink? Uh, Ted's Signature cocktail is the Nittany Lion, and I have no idea what's in it but it's... it's not half-bad. We were going to invite you... but... after what happened, I was afraid it would be in poor taste. How are you? I'm sorry. That was a stupid question. I'm terrible in situations like this. I don't know what to say. I wanted to call you, but I figured you wouldn't want to be bothered with so many people calling your house. No one talks to us anymore. Oh... It just scared me. You know? Linda? Yeah? Okay. Thanks. Thanks for letting me know. God damn it! What? Maurice made bail. His lawyers got it reduced, and his family got him out. He's under house arrest. Can I help you? Are you Terry Wright? And who wants to know? You bought a watch from a pawn shop a few weeks ago. How'd you get my address? Can I buy it back from you? Man, get off my porch. I have cash! It's not for sale. Please? Name your price! It's not for sale! No shorts. Straight money. Give me that! Get out of here. Get the fuck out of here. The fuck is you doing? This is what you do? You sell poison to kids? I sell high quality shit for paying customers. Now won't you give that back to my boy before you open a door you can't walk through? You see this, my man? Are you fucking crazy? Whatchu gon' do with that? We're strapped out here, my man. Don't you come any closer. I'll fucking hit you, man. I'll fucking break your head open. Hey, hey, hey; yo, I got that thing you was looking for. - Yeah. - Yo, T. This your boy? Yeah, yeah, he's an old acquaintance. We served time together. Tell him to move his car 'cause he's scaring away my customers. I got you. I got you. Yo, you got a death wish? Come on. You know, Meeko, he don't play. I'm just not thinking straight. Would you reconsider the watch? Man, if that watch is so important to you, why did you pawn it in the first place? I think my son sold it. To buy heroin. Oh... He's dead. Oh... Man, let me show you something. Once it gets into you, there's nothing else. You're like a wild animal. All you smell is blood. I'd have sold the clothes off my kids back. I practically did! Well. Last month, my daughter, she wrote to me... Saying she's getting married. Hmm. Yeah. Wanted to know if I wanted to come to the wedding. She didn't have to do that. After all the shit that I pulled? Mm-mm. So I'm gonna go. Show her that I'm all right. Show her I'm getting better. You know? Show her that I'm sorry. So I've been saving up my coins. Got me a new suit, new pair of shoes, and a new watch. Been three years since my last fix. Not a day goes by where my heart doesn't race thinking about it. Not one day. This is too close to the ground. You can't put a pantry in here. What are you... what are you talking about? What else are you gonna use it for, Adam? Look at how far away from the kitchen it is. - Adam, they... - This has to be 15 feet from the kitchen; it's too far. Adam, they have legs. I believe that when you're in the middle of something, you have to grab something from the pantry, and you don't have time to run all the way down the hall. No, look at the blueprint right here. How much pumpkin do we need? We'll make a pie. How many pies? What do you want for dinner? Whatever. Whatever? You were the one... Stay away from me! Stay away from me! You are not allowed within 100 yards... Touch me again! I'll have your ass in jail so fast. - Try me. - How could you not tell me Doug was using? Oh. How could you not know Danny was? I brought your son into our home. Oh, what are you, mother of the year now? Let's go. I barely even see my son. And I knew what was going on. Where the hell were you, Linda? Who does that woman think she is talking to me that way? What? I didn't say anything. You're thinking it. Told you Danny should have gone away to school. He wanted to stay here. So he could be close to Colleen. That was your brother's decision. Well, it was the wrong one. Are you saying if he'd went away to school, this wouldn't have happened? No. But if you and dad would have pushed him harder, maybe school would have been more important to him than Colleen and all the losers he hung out with. We pushed him. He wasn't as naturally gifted a student as you are. Danny was a lot smarter than you give him credit for. All he had to do was apply himself. but you let him get away with Cs. I didn't let him get away with anything. I was a good mother. Do you hear me? A good mother! Mom? Mom! Hey, where's Danny's car? What happened? Oh, Anna and I got into a minor collision. We're fine. The car, on the other hand, is gonna need $3,000 worth of repairs. $3,000. Sorry, it was an accident. Were you the one driving? Yeah, so? I just don't think you should be behind the wheel for a while. - I'm fine. - You're not fine. You don't sleep, you hardly ever eat, all you do is drink coffee. When was the last time you had a decent shower? I mean, you're not even, like, here, here, here. Well, I'm sorry I'm not like you. I'm sorry I can't go to work every day like a goddamn robot! I'm not built like that. Either life goes on or it doesn't. So please, Linda, come back here. Oh, okay. Come back here. Linda? Linda? Where are you going? Going for a run. I'm sorry. Danny. Danny! Danny! No! Danny, no! No! It was a dream. It was a dream. No! By the ground? It'll probably take a few days. Do you think we'll be all right in there? I do wanna... ...So I think he'll be okay? Good thinking. Right. Okay. Yeah, I'll let her know. Bye. So that was Channel Four News. They said something about a Facebook post? No way. Absolutely not. I need to talk about what happened to Danny. They'll say anything to get you on TV. Maybe. But I need people to know that there are drugs out there that can kill you. Things are finally starting to calm down. Mom? Don't you want to move on and stop reliving the worst day of all of our lives? I want Danny's death to mean something. What happened to us is private. It is nobody's business but ours. This is happening everywhere! Constantly. I need to say something. What, Anna? You really think those kids who came to Danny's memorial service are going to stop using because you tell them to? No, but if their parents know what's out there, then maybe the kids will... What about us? Do you even care what it's doing to us? Anna, wait! Tonight, we have a special guest, a registered nurse whose 19-year-old son was found dead last month from a heroin overdose. I couldn't tell from my kid's behavior. Later, I learned from his friends, the prescription painkillers Xanax... Dad, where's Anna? - I'll go get her. - MDMA and molly are the norm. People need to wake up. Not gonna let my son's death... Anna? What? She'll be back. No, she won't. - Hi. - Hi. Can I help you find something? Uh, yes, I'm looking for a baby gift for Kelly Lajterman. I believe she's registered here. Yeah, sure, I can go print that up for you. Feel free to look around. Ma'am? Ma'am. Are you okay? So it wasn't a heart attack. No, but your heart rate was abnormally high. We'd like for you to stay a few days just so we can keep an eye on things. Thank you, doctor. Ham and cheese or PBJ? Doesn't matter. Of course it matters. This here is honey roasted ham, and this is PBJ. Guava jelly. I thought it was kind of interesting. Do you still love me? You blame me. Tito... If I hadn't worked so much, I could have taken an interest in... in what was important to him. You took an interest in what was important to him. Every night at dinner, you asked him about his school, his friends. This isn't your fault. Yes, it is. The reason the lights are on in our house is because of you. The reason we have food on our table is because of you. We couldn't have gone on without you. I couldn't have gone on without you. Then why don't you let me touch you? I think the hardest thing for me is how clean the house is. Seemed like every time I came home from work, there'd be video games all around or bags of chips. I was always telling him to clean up! Don't leave everything such a mess. Now... Just once... I wish I could come home and trip over his sneakers at the entryway. Or come across his dirty socks. I remember every single time I yelled at him for not taking out the trash. Or leaving dirty dishes in the sink. But I can't remember if I told him I loved him the last time we spoke. You did. You did. I did? You did. Hey, sweetie? You got a letter from Australia. What's it say? I failed at the one thing a mother should do. I'm sorry. I don't know what I'm gonna do without you. Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Life after you. What your death from drugs leaves behind. There are no words a mother can use to explain to anyone what losing a child does to her and to her family. Danny didn't wanna die. The afternoon showers are likely. In other news, a grand jury in North Dakota indicted Maurice Brennan earlier this month along with Chinese defendants accused of manufacturing fentanyl and other opiates according to the U.S. Attorney's Office. He had been transported to Oklahoma to await transfer to North Dakota when his body was found from an apparent suicide. Federal authorities said the transfer center staff found Brennan unresponsive in his cell at 11:40 p.m. on Friday evening. Staff quote... I wanna sell the house. Georgina says it's gonna take a while to sell the house with everything that happened, so... She also said there's some houses for sale in the next town over. If you feel like it. You're gonna love this one. It's a ranch with a new addition, and an in-ground swimming pool. So what do you think, amor? You want to go inside? Ope. Mikey Mike, what's going on? Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down, slow down. Oh, yes! Oh, it happened so fast. We thought we were gonna have her in the car! Oh. Oh, my. It's grandpa. Mm. Her name is Michelle. Do you wanna hold her? Aww. You know what I'm saying? All right, I wanna see this kid...
