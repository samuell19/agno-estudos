[barking] Whoa! Jake, where are you going? [barking] Oh, well. Hello. How are you? Oh, hi. Hi! I see you've met Jake. Yeah. Not shy, is he? No. I'm Katherine Wright. I live upstairs. Hi. I'm Lisa Haynes, downstairs. Sorry. He just likes to stick his little nose into everything. Don't you, Jake? Well, he probably smells friends. Friends? Yeah. Oh! Oh. Goodness, Jakie, look. Look! Yeah. They are so precious. I know, right? I was only going to get one, but then I saw the litter and there were eight of them. Eight puppies. Yeah. These three were the closest. This is Mario, Luigi, and Pasquale. Hello. Hello. I didn't have the heart to separate 'em. Aw! Oh, Jake. [Jake barks] So, anyway, she called last week, and they're engaged. Oh, wow. Yeah. Congratulations. Michael's such a sweet guy, too. They're going this Christmas to be with his parents in Idaho, so, Rod and me-- Rod's my husband-- it'll be our first Christmas away from home. Aw. Well, for me, home is, um-- Hmm... Home is here. Now. So does that mean you're spending Christmas here? Yeah. Yeah. My mom travels a lot. She's actually in Spain for a few months. That's nice. What does she do? As far as I can tell, enjoy herself thoroughly. What about your dad? He, uh-- He passed away when I was in college. Oh, I'm sorry. That's okay. It was a long time ago. He-- He left my mom and sister and I when I was a kid, so he was never really in the picture. Wow! Look at that. Oh... Wow. You okay? Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. It's just, um... my ex. I thought I threw out all the pictures. Guess that one slipped by you, huh? When you were packing. Maybe. Maybe you liked the frame? Yeah. That's probably it. You know, you want me to just slip that out of the frame and throw that picture out? No! No. Thank you. It's... You're not over him. What? No. No, no, no. It's... No, no, no, no, no. No, ahh. No, I am, I am. I'm over him. Trust me. It's just, um... It's just complicated. We were friends forever. Like, kids? Like five years old. That's a long time. Yeah. You know, he, um, he didn't work up the courage to ask me out until college. We wound up going to the same school, so... We dated for a few years after graduation, but, um... I guess we figured something better would come along, so we broke it off. And, um... did it? [clears throat] Excuse me? Did something better come along? I'm sorry. That is none of my business. No. No, no, no. It's fine. You know, at the end of the day, he and I were just... Puppy love. You know, I should probably get back and make Rod dinner. I want you to come meet him soon. Yeah, I'd love that. And hey, thank you for helping me. Oh, no problem. If you ever need anyone to walk Jake, please let me know. I'll take you up on that. Perfect. Welcome to the neighborhood, Lisa. Thank you. Come on, old man. Come on. There you go. Upstairs. Upstairs. [door shuts] [ball bouncing] It's all in the wrist. In the wrist? Yeah. Thank you. All right. Helped my concentration. [chuckles] You got a good shot for, um... For what? Oh, you know. No, I don't know. What? Uh, for, for... An old guy. [both laugh] I don't mean any disrespect. I mean, are you 65? Do I look 65? No! No, no. You look, um... 'Cause your shot is great. And you... I mean, you're obviously in good shape. 40. Tops. [laughs] Thank you. Thank you. Your age is none of my business. I've seen you around. It's just usually someone of your... My age? No. Wisdom and experience. Usually on the golf course. Oh, golf. Well, when I moved here after I retired, I thought I'd try golf, but you know, golf bored...out of me before I was retired. I couldn't watch it on television. I used to like basketball. Figured I'd try that. May I? Sure. Wow. I played in college. I'm David Bennett. Rod Wright, David. Nice to meet you. Yeah. Did you go pro? No. Probably because I played bench mostly. Horse? Sure. Yeah? All right. Where did you bench, at Duke? No, I got a letter from them. I went to State. State? Why? A girl I knew went to State. Oh. Well, I married a girl in college, too. Didn't really work out like that for me. I'm... I'm sorry. We haven't talked in a couple years. I hear she still lives in the area. A lot like my basketball career. Over. Absolutely, Anna. No. Not at all. We are fine. We'll be fine. Sweetheart, I love you, too. And be sure to give Mitch our love, okay? Happy almost Christmas. Yeah. Bye. You okay? Yeah. Yeah. So, you had a really good day today with that boy? Uh, huh. David. Yeah, yeah. Well, he seems like a nice kid. I can't remember the last time I had a pick-up game of horse with some random kid. You were probably a kid. Yeah, I probably was. So? Did you win? This is good. What was this? [laughs] You know that girl downstairs? Lisa? Mm-hmm. She's a really, really nice girl. Yeah, is she? Look at us, making new friends with young people. Oh, and Rod. You should see her puppies. Yeah, puppies. She's got puppies. Our puppy's getting pretty big, isn't he? I wonder why. Don't feed him. Okay. All right. Down, Jake. Anyway, she said she's going to look after Jake when we're with Jim and Patty tomorrow. That's good. So, um, you say this David is a nice guy? I think so. I don't know. He seems to be from what I could tell, playing a game of horse. Is he single? Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. It's kind of a coincidence, isn't it? You meet a really nice boy. I met a really nice girl. Today, on the same day. Yeah. Are you getting bored with this retirement stuff? No. I'm... I'm having a great time. You are? Yeah, you know. Jim and Patty. The beach. The bikinis. The, uh, pick-up basketball games. Bikinis. Come on, come on. Let's go this way. Let's go this way. Wait for the other puppy. Hi. [puppies whining] David? [barking] [squeals] There's, um, there's something I've been wanting to ask you. Right. No. No, no, no. Jake. Jake, no. No, you can't go out there. [barking] There's chocolate and glass and other bad stuff. No, no! Jake, stop! Stop! Jake, no. No! No, no, no, no! Come back here! No. Come back here! Jake! [screams] Sorry. Jake, Jake, Jake! Guys, guys. Hey. [chuckles] All right. Okay. Oh. Jake. Come on. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay. I am so, so sorry, David. Lisa. Yeah. Wait, Lisa... Lisa? Lisa-Lisa? Well, just one Lisa. Hi. Well, I've heard so much about you. Really? This is Kelly, my, um... Girlfriend. It's nice to meet you. Hi. Hello. Where did it go? What? The bag. A little velvet bag with the engagement ring. Engagement ring? Engagement ring? Aunt Pearl's ring. Aunt Pearl's ring? Who's Aunt Pearl? I don't see this anywhere. I'll help you look. I'll find it. You've done enough. Excuse me? Maybe you should just go. Yeah, maybe. It's not like I did this on purpose. [chuckles] Are you serious? I'm about to propose, and you sic a pack of wild dogs on me? Is something going on between you two that maybe you should think about telling me? I'm sorry. I'm just going to go. I'm sorry. I'm gonna go. Yes, go. No! Wait! You don't go. Her go. Where are you going? What is going on? Okay. Mario. Luigi. Pasquale. Mario? Mario! Mario! Mario! Mario! Okay, Aunt Lis, I post this in my profile, too? Oh, why was I so stupid? I should have never taken my eyes off of him. He's only a puppy. I mean, how far could he have really gotten? Yeah, but I didn't even get his tags done yet. I'm sure she's right, sweetheart. Somebody's probably found him by now. [knocking] Look. See? Rod. I got your note. I bumped into David outside. David. Interesting. Yeah. David, this is my wife Katherine, and, uh... That's Lisa and Myra. [barks] And that's Jake. Yeah, we met. Yeah, you look kind of familiar. Um... Oh! So you didn't bring him. What? What do you want, Dave? Myra! Let me handle this, please. Thank you. Unless you have the dog, you should just go. It's a very fragile time. Okay. Okay, all right. Hi. Why don't you take Luigi and Pasquale and go outside and play? Yeah, we should get going, too. I just got here. So, Jake-- Oh. Oh, I'm sorry. [Katherine] I'm so sorry. He's just-- He's really stubborn sometimes. Come on, Jake. Whats going on? I'll explain when we get home. Nice to meet you, David. Yeah, you, too. Um, I guess, uh, you still haven't found your puppy. No. Look, David, about this morning, I-- No, I was out of line. That I did it on purpose? Well, I didn't-- I didn't say that exactly. Well, you didn't have to. You gave me that look. What look? That look you do. That... That look right there! Okay. Okay, look. To be fair-- I know. I know. You're right. I know. It seemed like a planned operation, but as strange as it seems, my intentions were not to sabotage your proposal, lose my puppy and Aunt Pearl's ring. I had it all planned out. I was going to tell her the story, and you of all people know the story and how important that ring is to me. When did Aunt Pearl give you the ring? She died last year. Oh. I'm-- I'm so sorry. Why didn't you say something? We hadn't spoke in forever. What was I going to do, call you up and say, "Hey, how you doin'? By the way, Aunt Pearl died." Well, if that's how you would have went about it, then no. Still the same David. [Lisa] So... engaged. Congratulations. I'm assuming the ring's just a formality. [chuckles] As huge as a problem as that is, it's the least of my worries. Kelly still thinks that there's something between us. What? What in the world gave her that idea? When you finally work up the nerve to propose to a woman that you want to spend the rest of your life with, you expect tears followed by, "Yes, yes, a thousand times, yes." You don't expect your ex-girlfriend's dogs to knock you over and leave you standing there-- Okay, I get it. Uh... Am I going to have to hire a skywriter to apologize for this? I just need you to explain to her that it's over between us. What? She doesn't believe you? She just wants to hear it from you. Why? Because. She doesn't know all the stuff. What stuff? You know, stuff. Stuff that you said. I don't even remember. Uh, hmm. All right. Let's see. I'm immature. Uh... Oh! I can't commit. Is that what I said? "You're never going to change. We might as well call this what it is, David. I love you, but I'm not in love with you. Okay, okay! I get it. You should find somebody else." It's all starting to come back to me. Thanks. Lis. I found somebody else. Okay. Yeah. I... I'll talk to her. But I'm super busy this week, so I don't know. You still working at Helkin and Meyer? For all your public relation needs. How about you? Still trying to figure out what to do with yourself? No, I finally completed my MBA, and I took a job as a senior vice president over at Quantifund. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Completed your MBA? Gotta grow up sometime, right? Yeah, I guess so. Wow. Congrats. I'm... I'm impressed. So you'll talk to Kelly. Yeah, yeah. Absolutely. I'll-- I'll fix it. Yeah. Hey! And, uh... um... good luck finding the ring. And good luck finding your puppy. [mouthing] [Lisa] So what's his name? [Myra] His name's Freddie Donavan, and he's always following me and thinks I don't notice, but I do. And he's always asking me stupid stuff. What do you mean, stupid stuff? Like, you know, "What page is this on? What did you think of that quiz?" I swear to God, he hit puberty and forgot how to conduct a decent conversation. I mean, he's so nervous. Do you like him? Oh, here you go. He clearly likes me, right? So what's the problem? Aunt Lis, come on. You of all people should understand how hard it is for me to think romantically about a guy I used to finger-paint with in kindergarten. Me of all people? Well, from what I gather, that's ultimately why you broke up with David. He's a cute, sweet guy, and even though you tried for a while, you just see him as a guy you used to finger-paint with. You know what? I don't even know what you're talking about. No idea. No clue. Shoot! Wait. What? Who's that? Unbelievable. Lisa-Lisa. Ruined my engagement Lisa. It's Kelly. Who? It's David's fiancée. Well, girlfriend. Well, I don't know. I don't care. Can she see me? No. She's kind of going off to her friends. [gasps] She just said you were a ditch. [gasps] What does that mean? Yeah, I think she saw you. Shoot! All right. You can't blame her, right? You expect this kind of thing from a rebound. No, Myra. She's not a rebound. They're getting engaged. Well, not without that ring, they aren't. Well played, Aunt Lis. Well played. Oh, God. Not you, too. I'm not interested in David. Besides, I'm a grown woman. Do you really think I would stoop to something so immature? Yeah, you are hiding behind a wall. Okay. [clears throat] There she is. Okay, so I'll... I'm gonna do this. What's the big deal? She's a little thing. I think you could take her. Myra, we're not gonna fight. David wants me to talk to her. About what? She thinks I still love him. Ooh! Do you? He wants to marry someone else. Right, right. And he did not want to marry you after all those years of friendship. Ooh, that's gotta sting. Especially since he's only known that one for about five minutes. Okay, you know what? You're really getting on my nerves. I'm gonna stay. You're not. I need you to take the puppies and meet me back at my place. I kinda like to see how you handle this. I get it, but no. Just go. Just go. Thank you. See ya. Yeah. Hi. Hello. Hey. Well, I'm glad that she took those away. I'd hate for someone else around here to get attacked. Oh, right. About that, I'm really sorry. It was such a beautiful morning until you ruined it. Yeah. Again, I'm-- I'm really sorry, but you do have to understand that it was just an accident. Hmm. After the fact, I'm not exactly a dog person. You gotta realize how just conveniently weird this whole thing was. No, yeah. Totally. I guess so. But I think you're blowing it a little bit out of proportion. Look, he told me how close you two were. Yeah, but he also must have also said that we haven't spoken in a couple years. He did. We've moved on, obviously. Well, it didn't look like that on the beach. Oh, no, no. We've totally moved on. Why would you think that? Because you're the ideal, Lisa. You don't have any idea, do you, how difficult it is to compete with a thousand memories? Kelly, he wants to marry you. There isn't anything going on between us. I promise. So you don't have any feelings for him? Okay, all right. He's just the guy I used to finger-paint with. I don't think I like the sound of that. No, no, no! When you're kids, like at school. Look, it's stupid. Look, we're just friends. Mm-hmm. It didn't work out. Okay? I don't want to be with him. I want him to be with you. I'm not in love with him anymore. I'm cool with everything. You're cool with everything. I'm cool with everything. We're over. He's yours now. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Okay. All right. I'm going to apologize to you now. I'm sorry. I mean, I really went psycho on you there. Whoa! But you understand where I was coming from. Yes! No, of course, of course. It's like, first of all, I feel like I know you. And that's really weird. That is really weird, because you just hugged me, and I feel like I don't know you at all. Gee whiz. So we're even-Steven on the weird. Well, listen. Truth revealed, big relief. Well, I'm-- I'm glad. [sighs] And between you and I, regarding the whole dog attack, listen, I should actually be thanking you. Thank me? Well, of course I want to get engaged, but I just, I feel kind of funny with the whole Aunt Pearl ring situation. Kind of funny? Yeah, I mean, after the mess at the beach that you caused, David sat me down, and he told me a story, and it was cute, kind of. But the truth of it is, Aunt Pearl's ring is actually just this old-- Oh, it's a cheap ring. Yeah, well... Exactly. Well. And so maybe now that it's gone, he'll have the sense enough to get me a real ring. A real ring? Yes. You know, something with value. Kelly! Okay, Lainie's getting impatient. So, um, I, for one, am glad that we had this talk. Yeah, me, too. Me, too. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Can you help me find my aunt's dog? Please? Thank you. Freddie Donovan? Oh, no. Not happening. Oh, sir! Sir! Can you help me find my aunt's puppy? Can you please help me find my puppy Mario? Thank you. Hey, Jakie boy. The pups are out with Myra, looking for Mario. You haven't seen him, have you? All right, well, thanks for keeping an eye out. Oh! Well, make yourself at home. Can I get you something? How about kibble? Oh, how about a beer, hmm? Well, I don't have any beer. Hey. Hey, what do you have there? Wait, come here. Where you going? Jake! Hey, stop. Stop. Stop. What are you doing to me? No, Jake. Stop. Stop. Jake, stop it! Come here. Come Back. Jake! Jake, Jake, Jake. Jake, Jake. What are you doing? Son of a... Ohh! Oh, God, I'm so sorry. It's my fault. My fault. Lis. David. Is this your dog? [whimpering] Is this your suit? Yeah. I have a few of them now. You're wearing suits now? Yeah, I told you I was a senior vice president. Yeah, I guess I didn't actually believe it. That sounded a lot better in my head. So this is your dog? Rod and Katherine's. My neighbors. Yeah. He's a real handful, that one. Can't sit still. Yeah, I can see that. [whimpering] He was rooting through my stuff and... [chuckles] Oh! I always wondered where this went. Where did you-- How did you wind up with it? Oh. Was it that... that concert! That's right. [together] The Big Swampland Outdoor Music Fest. Summer after senior year. Yeah. [laughs] Remember? I spilled. That margarita. On the front of your shirt. And this was in your back seat. My back seat. Yeah. That was a fun night. Kelly... Yeah. Um, said that you were great. Oh, she did? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Said you guys had a good little chat, told me all about it, and that you were cool with everything. Well, now you can pop the question. Really wish I had that ring. I'm sure she'll say yes without it. You think so? So how'd you two meet, anyway? Uh, you know, a work mixer. A work mixer? Yeah. It's not how I thought I would meet my wife, but there she was, very gorgeous and sweet. Funny. [car beeps] Sounds like someone I know. Except the sweet part. [laughs] You know, I... We haven't spoken in a really long time, but I thought now that I'm marrying somebody else, maybe we could be friends again. David, we were never not friends. Great. Then I'll put you on the invitation list. You haven't even proposed. You already have a list? A list, a floor plan, menus. Kelly's got wedding fever. She's been looking for good spots for years. Wow. Yeah, you guys are in quite a hurry, aren't you? We're in love. It's like you said, when you know, You know. you know. I said a lot of stuff there at the end, didn't I? Water under the bridge. Uh, yeah, I should probably get him back. Katherine's probably worried. Yeah. Come on, Jake. I think he likes me. Come on. I don't think he wants to go. Huh, yeah. Hey, Lis. Yeah? Thanks. Hiya, Freddie. Oh, hey, Myra. Here, let me help you with that. Thank you. Hey, guys. What are their names? Oh. That's Luigi with the blue collar, and that's Pasquale with the black collar. Hi, Pasquale. Hi, Luigi. I saw you a little earlier. Wh-What are you talking about? When you were following me. I don't know what... I saw you following me, Freddie. What's up? Are these your puppies? No, they're my aunt's. She's missing one and-- Oh, you haven't seen another one around, have you? When you know, you know, he says? He's using my own words against me. He didn't know with me. That's what he's saying. I don't care. I'm not jealous. He can marry whoever he wants. It's the principle of the thing. And don't you defend him. I know you like him. Oh. What a relief. Yeah, I'm sorry. He came in and just ran off. He ran off? Yeah, um... Jake. Very weird. But he's a smart guy. Yeah. I guess it runs in the family. Come on. Hey, um... Do you have a second? Hey, Rod. Hey, David. How are you, man? Don't look like you're dressed for basketball. No, going to my girlfriend's. Fiancée's. No, girlfriend's house. You having a little trouble making up your mind here? Lisa, right? What? The girl that lives downstairs. No. No, no, no. No. She's old-- Well, she's an ex. She's a lot like my basketball career thing. Over. Exactly. That's too bad. Yeah. You looked like a nice couple. Ah. I'm starting to sound like my wife. Let me ask you something. How long you been married? Forty years. My Uncle Matt was married to my Aunt Pearl for 65. They officially met in high school. But apparently Uncle Matt had his eye on Aunt Pearl since the seventh grade and had a hard time working up the nerve to approach her. Remember those toy vending machines? What, with the claw? No, no, no claw. The way he tells it, it was just a vending machine. And when Uncle Matt got back from Korea... He had like a dime to his name. He looks into the vending machine, and he can just barely make out the ring... Wedged between a paddle and one of those, um... Rubber balls and a top. And the ring's just, it's peeking out. It was... Twinkling. Twinkling? Twinkling? Twinkling. That's what he said. He said it was... Calling to him. So he said... I'm gonna get that ring with this dime, and when I do I'm going to ask Pearl Nedermarker to marry me. So he drops that dime in the machine... And he turns the dial... And out came the ring. It's like a one in a hundred shot. Or however many toys there were in the machine. The point is... He willed it. So he took it as a sign and proposed to Aunt Pearl that same night. When Aunt Pearl passed, she left me the ring. David always loved that story. You see, Uncle Matt kind of willed it to himself, and I... I just lost it. So I'm wondering... You're not sure. I mean, 40 years is a long time, right? It's a blink of an eye, son. What? My Uncle Matt used to say the same thing. Well... good luck. You know, maybe it's none of my business, but I really do think they're rushing into things. I mean, I don't know how long he's known this girl for. Yeah, that is important criteria. And then what? All of a sudden he proposes, just like that? You trying to take the finish off that? I should say something to him, don't you think? Yeah, I think so. Yeah, I should march over there and say, "David, you're making a terrible mistake. Aunt Pearl would not approve of Kelly." Well, Aunt Pearl-- Obviously he really loved his Aunt Pearl. I understand that, sweetheart, but that's-- And Aunt Pearl really liked me. I'm telling you, Katherine, I don't know about this Kelly girl. Lisa. Yeah. You still in love with David? What? Until the other day, I hadn't even thought about him. He must have at least crossed your mind when you were packing that picture. Exactly what happened with you two? We broke up. That's what happens. I understand that you broke up, but there must have been a reason. Okay, so get this. We're out one night, and I think-- well, I think-- he's about to pop the question and then all of a sudden he starts saying things like, "Well, maybe, sorta, I don't know. Um, taking a break. Seeing what's out there." What? So he broke up with you. Technically, it was a mutual thing. Because you know what I told him? "Oh, you want to see what's out there? Have at it." That's what I said. And so he found Kelly. Kelly? Yeah. No. No, no, no, no, no. He came running back to me a month after, saying he'd made a terrible mistake. You know what I told him? "You should've thought about that n the first place," and I didn't take him back. That's what I said. Oh. So you didn't take him back. Well, I mean, I did, eventually. Now I'm really getting confused. I think maybe you're leaving something important out. Well, I just... I just realized that it was never going to work out, so I told him to get over me, that I didn't love him anymore. Ouch. I know. It was a bit harsh. But it was for the best. Is that the way that you really felt? I don't know... how I feel. All I kept thinking about was my dad. I don't understand. Here we have a guy that was never around. Treated my mother terribly. Obviously they had some laughs, but at some point, I just never saw her laughing. Not ever? Not with him. No. But then when-- when he died, it was like, whoosh! Like the dam broke. You should have seen the way she was crying. Didn't you cry, too? A little, I guess. I feel kind of bad about it, but I... I didn't really know him. But I asked her... "Why in the world are you crying so hard, and for him?" And she told me, with tears in her eyes... "He was my first love." I guess I'll never get over that. I love my mom, but I decided right there and then that I was not going to fall hard for David. [sighs] So you just decided that you weren't going to fall in love with him. Well, yeah. You know what I mean. I had to protect myself from something that was never going to work. Well, if you just decided that... then why do you care whether he marries Kelly or not? Freddie, I don't know what to say. I mean, you really came through. I did? You really did. Oh, there was something else. What's the matter? You've never seen two people kiss before? [door closes] Whoa. Freddie, slow down. It was just a kiss. Shut up. It was around his neck. Oh, my God! That's right! David lost his ring. This must be it. Mario, did you take that ring on purpose? [whimpers] I say bury it. I can't do that. From what you said, she won't care, right? True. [horn honks] Oh, that's my mom. Well, thanks so much for finding Mario. Oh, that's okay. I'll accept my reward in installments. Wait. It seems to me that Freddie should be the one getting the reward. Oh! Oh! I think he already got his reward, huh? Are you blushing? You are. You're blushing. You're blushing. You have to tell me. Wait! No. [horn honks] [door shuts] 42,776 real crystals. Oh, my God! Okay! Ohh! It's like a fantasy! A fantasy come true! David, can you imagine? Yeah, here. Yes, absolutely. Of course, maybe they won't come. Maybe just... Tanya, you're gonna seriously turn it out. [Jake whines] [Katherine] Evening, Lis. Hey, guys. Taking the big man for an evening stroll? Yeah, and I'm exhausted. [laughing] You mean the dog. Well, you guys have a good night. Okay, you, too. [Katherine] Jake, come on, honey. [whining] Oh, Jake! Looks like he doesn't want to go in. I'm just going for a little walk. I'd be happy to take him. That'd be great. Thank you. I could use the company. Thank you, honey. Of course. Bye. You're right. You're right. It's not that big a deal. It's just a stupid piece of plastic. It's just that it means so much to him, and he wants to give it to her, and she doesn't even care! Do you understand? That's the kind of stuff you have to take into consideration when proposing to someone, right? Maybe I'm being a little... Oh, God. I must be out of my mind. I'm telling a dog I'm still in love with my ex-boyfriend-- [gasps] [Jake whines] Oh, my God. I'm still in love with David. I gotta tell him. [barks] I gotta tell him. [barks] I'm going to tell him. I'm going to tell him. Unless you don't think I should. Okay. Now I've lost it. Well, it's nice to see you, too. [nervous chuckle] Why are you here? I was wondering if we can come in for a minute. There's something I have to talk to you about. "We"? Did you adopt him? He's with you more than he's with your neighbors. Oh, no. [laughs] You're cute. Uh, funny. Funny. Can we talk some other time? Kelly's on her way over. Oh, well, actually, that's kind of what I want to talk to you about. David, um-- Wow. You, uh, you classed this place up. Is that a new couch and coffee table? [chuckles] It's new furniture, yeah. Wow. She, uh-- She really-- You two are really in love, aren't you? Well, I wanted to give my wife Aunt Pearl's ring. Hmm. But... Huh. She's, uh-- She's gonna love it. Should. She picked it out. What? She picked it out? Yeah, she's got this whole wedding thing memorized. [chuckles] Scripted, really. Really. It's actually kind of cute. She's really excited. You're really doing this, aren't you? Yeah. And I'd like to make it official tonight, unless you have plans on screwing it up again. [laughing] Yeah, well... Listen, Lis, she's coming over. You have to go. What are you even doing here? Well, um... Myra found Mario. Mario. The puppy. Right. The puppy. My puppy. Yeah. [clattering] Oh, Jake, no. No, no, no. Get down. Oh. Oh. It's okay. It's, uh, it's, uh-- Oh, God, it's, um-- I, uh-- I think he knocked it down the sink. [David] I can't believe this! I'm sorry. You know what? Call a plumber. Propose in the morning. What is it with you and these dogs? I don't know! Maybe they're-- Oh, we're-- I'm trying to tell you something. What does that mean? I... [Kelly singing] * Ring ring ring Answer the phone * * Ring ring ring ring Answer the phone * That's... her. * Ring ring, why haven't you answered the phone by now * Hi. [chuckles] Oh, no. Yeah, that's-that's fine. [chuckling] Yeah. [whining] You're the best. I love you. No, I-- I love you, too, snookums. Okay. All right. Bye. She's running late. Ah. You see? Everything worked out. Again with the look. Lis... I'm sorry. Uh-- I'm going. Can you take your-- Thank you. Yes. Okay. Jake. Come on! Sorry. Mm-hmm. How does he even... Well, that didn't go as I expected. But what did I expect? He loves her, not me anymore. It looks delicious. [chuckles] Thank you. Do you want some more wine? Sure. Okay. [Michael] Aw, come on! Ah! Jiminy Christmas! [Michael muttering] [both laugh] Come on, you! Son of a Blitzen! Ow! I'm-- Could you give me a second? I'm gonna just-- 'Cause he-- I'll be right back. Righty tighty. [grunts] Lefty loosey. Lefty-- [grunting] Quick little.. Hey. Hey! Aah! Ah! Hey! Ouch! What? You said this would take 15 minutes. That was over an hour ago. Yeah, well, now it's personal, okay? I'm kind of in the middle of something. Yeah, she's cute. Look. If I had known it was gonna take this long, I would have said let's do it another time. I have managed this building for 26 years. I know the pipes. All right? Could we call it a night? I can get a real plumber here tomorrow. A real plumber will charge me 500 bucks. A real plumber might find my ring. Yeah, but I'm this close! Come on! [grunting] Come on. For heaven's sake. Just-- [grunting] Aah! [sighing, breathing heavily] [grunts, spits] Voilà! [chuckles] [laughing] Hey... [grunting] What's the matter? You look like you want me to put the ring back in the sink, yeah? What? Well... you're gonna pop the question, aren't you? So... what's the matter? You can't decide? [Lisa, David laughing] [David] That's right. [David &amp; Lisa] The Big Swampland Outdoor Music Fest. Hey, let me ask you something. Yeah-- Wh-Whoa. Uh, David-- [chuckles] Look, you've been in the building for a long time, but, uh... you're not gonna ask me to marry you, are you? What? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, look. Oh, good. It's a survey I'm taking. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I-I don't follow. Are you married? No! It's that bad? Oh... it's worse. Whoo! Smokin'! I understand why she's confusing the...out of you just by looking at her. [giggles] Say, how did your ring wind up in the sink, anyway? My ex-girlfriend's neighbor's dog knocked it down there. Oh, wow. You are really in over your head, aren't you? Well, marriage is forever. [laughing] Ho ho ho ho ho! Oh, ho ho ho ho ho! Terrific. [laughing] "Marriage is forever." Yeah, ho ho ho! Yeah, well, you tell that to my last two wives. [laughing] Good luck. [door opening, closing] I hate that fat man. I still don't understand. What's to understand? It's just confusing. Does she love him or not? Well, she's known him for, like, forever. So, yes? She loves him, but she doesn't love him that way. He's just like a friend. Oh. Do you get it? Yeah. I think so. No, not really. She just doesn't think of him that way. They're too good of friends. Kind of like us. Oh. Do you understand what I'm saying? Think so. Do you? Oh. Oh. I'm sorry, Freddie. It-- No, no, no. It's cool. It's cool. Are you sure? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I'm-- I'm-I'm-I'm fine. I-I-I gotta go do something. Freddie, are you okay? Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. I'll talk to you later, okay? Nice move. Six-four. Six-four? Six-four moi. [sighs] Where'd you meet your wife? What? Your wife. Oh, she was a year behind me in law school. She's a lawyer, too? Yeah, well, she practiced for a few years, but then when we had kids, she cut back. Only did the occasional deposition. Two girls, right? Yeah, and... [laughing] Yeah, and two more points. You're unreal. What type of vitamins are you taking? Sound mind, sound body. [laughing] Whoo! Ten-four. Well, I might add that you're playing pretty crappy today. You feeling all right? Got a lot on my mind. Like what? You sure about your wife? When you proposed, I mean. Well, I was in college, having a good time, was dating a lot. And then when I met Katherine, I knew for sure. That she'd be your wife? I knew it was serious. When I met her, I knew. And then, well, it took me a couple of years to propose. Couple years? Yeah, like I said, I was having a good time in college. When I finally did propose to her, I... I was never more sure of anything in my life. Haven't been to this day. You know what? She was the best thing that ever happened to me. [crash] Ah! Oh! What are you shaking your head about? You. Could have been a lot worse, Ro-- Ow. Sorry. Basketball. Why can't you play golf like everyone else? I told you how much I hate golf. It bores the...out of me. Yeah, but it's safer. What are you going to do with that? Put it under your knee. Okay, go ahead. One, two, three. Ah! Thank God that doctor had the sense to tell you never to play basketball again. I'm not gonna play basketball again. Well, it's not like you were going out for the NBA. [sighing] Sweetheart. You okay? [muttering] Just-- It's this beach life, you know? All of this leisurely stuff, I'm just not cut out for it. It's just-- You mean, "retirement." Well, yeah, I'm old, but I'm not dead. I mean, I don't want to be a judge again, but I could write a book or teach or something. All of this relaxing. I can't stand being here. Rod, are-are you saying what I think you're saying? Look, honey, I know you love it here and the beach, and Jim and Patty and the dogs-- I hate it here! What? I hate it here! I thought you, with Jim and Patty and the dogs-- Jim and Patty are driving me nuts. They hate Jake. They go on and on about the sun all the time. It's gonna be Christmas next week, and it's 90 degrees! Well, it was 79 at home last year. Home. I miss our home. And I miss our girls. Why didn't you say something? Because I thought that you loved it here. [laughing] The beach and the bikinis... Yeah, and the basketball. And I'll never play again. Well... we could get exercise in other ways. Turn off the light. Now? Mm-hmm. You'll be the shepherdess, I will be the hunter. [laughing] [growling] Oh, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow! Ooh! Sorry! You know, you and Mom are nothing alike. Thank you. She had the tree up before Thanksgiving. You know, I love your mom, and she loves me, but we maintain that love by agreeing to disagree. Oh, that actually kind of rhymes. [chuckling] But come on. You're right most of the time. I would like that in writing. Ha, ha, ha. What I mean is, you know, the way you are with David. How am I with David? You know, pitch-perfect. Wait. Right? I don't even know what you mean. I guess... I've seen the way you've been with him, and I kind of know you're upset. Upset? About what? He's getting married. No, Myra, I'm very-- Happy for him. I know. I know you are. But, Aunt Lis, come on. I think your mistake was dating him in the first place. That was my mistake? Well, yeah. If you never dated, then you wouldn't be so disappointed by it. That doesn't make any sense, does it? [knocking] Merry Christmas. Well, hello. Oh, that is so cute! Did you make this? Yeah. Well, Jake helped. [laughs] Huh. He's pretty handy in the kitchen. Ha, ha. There you are. Come in, come in. We're just trimming the tree. Can I get you anything? Oh, no, I can't stay. I've got to deliver a few more of those. I just wanted to invite you both to a little-- and your mom, if she can-- Christmas, uh, goodbye party we're throwing Saturday. Wait a minute. Goodbye party? Yeah, Rod and I-- Well, it just turns out that retirement didn't really take with Rod. And I really miss my girls. Yeah, I'm gonna miss you little guys, too. You. And, uh, I'm really gonna miss you, sweetheart. I'm really gonna miss you, Katherine. So, come give us a proper send-off. Rod invited David. And, also, if you wanna invite Freddie, Myra, that'd be fine. Oh, uh, we broke up. You what? I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you're still friends. So, anyway, hope you both come. Yes. Thank you. Come on. Jake. [whistles, kissing sounds] Come on. Good boy. You broke up with Freddie? You guys were together for, what, like a week. Oh. I forgot how silly puppy love can be. Exactly. That's what I've been trying to say. I figure, cut it off now and save myself the heartache. Oh, you like him. What? No. He's just a friend. Hmm, "just a friend." You like-him like him. It's not like that. Myra. Okay, fine, fine, I like him. I like him a lot, okay. Just... I'm afraid. I don't wanna get hurt like you did. I see how much you love David, and he's marrying someone else. You've been in love with him for like your whole life. Why won't you say anything? This might be hard for you to understand, but David deserves all the happiness in the world. Even if it's not with me. But aren't you completely miserable? Yeah, I know, it sucks, it hurts, but... my mistake wasn't dating him in the first place. My mistake was being so afraid to lose him that I let him go. Wow, major intimacy issues, Aunt Lis. Okay. I guess I'm not as pitch-perfect as you thought. Apparently not. Hey. It's too late for me. But I don't think Freddie's engaged yet. * Should auld acquaintance be forgot * * And never brought to mind * Should auld acquaintance be forgot * * And auld lang syne For auld lang syne, my dear * * For auld lang syne [laughing] [yammering] * We'll take a cup of kindness yet * * For auld lang syne * For auld lang syne Now, try not to knock the tree o-- Sweet dreams. See you. Hi. Hi. Hey, Mom. Hi, honey. Merry Christmas. Hey. Hey. Oh, hey. How are ya? Good. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas to you, too. How are you feeling? Oh, it's not as bad as it looks. Wow, cane. Yeah. One more word about it, I'll kick your... [laughing] [laughing] Rod, Katherine, this is Kelly, my fiancée. How do you do? Fine, thanks. I've heard so much about you. Really? Aw. I haven't heard anything about you. [laughs] That's good. No, Rod is the guy that I play basketball with. The old guy? The-- Yes! Hello! You've got great hair. Yeah, the old guy. Thank you, thank you. Would you like a drink? Why not? Follow me. Hi. Uh, hey! I got you something, yeah. Uh, thanks, but I didn't get you-- No, it's okay. I don't deserve it. That's not true. Just open it. Like right now? [chuckles] Yeah, now. Thank you. Freddie, you're such a sweetheart. I am? And I'm such a jerk. No, no, you're not. I mean, yeah, yeah, maybe a little, but... I'm just kidding. Do you wanna go for a walk? Listen to all these old people. Sure. Hey. [Kelly] That's Jenny and Mike. They started dating in junior high school. Chrissy and Nate, that was high school. Ah. But Julia has a place in the Hamptons. She's the one, and you know what they say. Anybody who's worth anything has a place there. Well, I-- That's-That's not true. I don't have a place up there. [laughing] Anyway, we don't wanna go all the way up there. So we're just gonna do it here, and that's cool, because all my girlfriends are here anyway. Right, and that'll make it easier to plan and coordinate. Yes! Exactly. And then as soon as I find somebody on the inside, I mean, we're pretty much set. "Inside"? I need someone with a connection to the venue that we want. Hi. Hey. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. How's everybody doing tonight? Great. Well, we are engaged! Oh. Wow. Congratulations. That's quite a rock. That's what my girlfriend Debbie said when she saw it. It was so sweet because she got so jealous. She's gonna be my maid of honor. That's great. Have you guys set a date? Well, as soon as... Possible. possible, really. The only hiccup is that, of course, we want to have it at The Plaza. But they said that they are completely booked for two years. Wow. Oh. I know. Really. Yeah. Completely booked? Well, I'm not making that up. That's what they said. [Lisa] That's just weird. But it's just really sad more than anything. I was just writing in my journal that if I don't get married in that place, I would feel like a bit of my heart died. Whoa. Someone is pretty excited. [nervous chuckle] Well, but anyway, speaking of dying... I just meant-- I was gonna say that I-- my throat is dying of thirst. I didn't mean-- I'm sorry. Mm, no, no. No. Why don't-- I'll-- Yeah, I'll be right back. [Kelly] Now, where are you guys from? Oh! [screaming] Sorry. No! Oh, Jake! This is silk. I'm sorry. No. The dog bumped me. It was an accident. Jake bumped me. It's ruined. Who is Jake? It's their dog. It was an accident. I think I could get that out. Come with me. It's all right. We'll be good. I'm gonna get some air. Hey. Hey. Sorry. She gets a little... worked up sometimes. Yeah. Yeah, well, you know, the holidays make everyone crazy. When you throw in a wedding, it's downright insane, huh? [chuckles] Seems like it, yeah. [sighing] So, um... congratulations. Really. I'm really happy you finally found somebody. Thanks. Don't worry. You'll find someone, too, Lis. You're, um... one of kind. Thanks. Um... [clears throat] Where did you find it? It was around Mario's neck. [laughing] What? Yeah. When I came by your house last week, I was gonna give it to you then, and-- You already had the other ring, and Kelly seems to really like the other one. I can't argue with you there. I can't believe you found it. Yeah. Well, I'm sorry I kept it. Now you can give it to the woman you're gonna spend the rest of your life with. Just like you always wanted. You know, I always thought that, um... [Kelly clears throat] David. Oh, there you are. Ooh. [chuckling] Are you ready to go? Michelle and Eric's party started. Michelle and Eric's party. That's Kelly's friends. That we're late for. I'm sure I'll meet them at the wedding. Thanks. Of course. Congratulations. And Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Thanks so much for helping me clean up, Lis. Yeah, of course. Rod couldn't do it with that bad knee. [chuckles] With or without that knee, I think it might have been the seven drinks that really did him in. You okay? Yeah. Yeah. Why wouldn't I be okay? Oh, oh, you mean because my first and only love is marrying someone else and irrevocably ruining my life by wrecking the best friendship I ever had because I was afraid? Yeah, you know, I'm actually surprised you're letting me help you clean up your living room and you're not worried that I'm actually burning down your lovely home to the ground. Yeah, uh, good point. I screwed up. You certainly did. Thanks. What do you want me to say, sweetheart? Seeing David engaged to that girl is breaking my heart. I was never in love with him. Are you trying to make me feel better? Because you're doing a terrible job at it. You just said that you were afraid. What exactly are you afraid of? [sighing] He was... He was so good. But he wasn't perfect. But who is? Oh, but he was pretty good. It's just that every time he veered from "amazing," I got scared. "Oh, he's going to hurt me. Oh, he's going to leave me." What I felt was so strong... that I figured that if I cut it off now, it wouldn't hurt as bad later. Yeah, I know, but you kind of told me that already. Yes, but it didn't work! Don't you see? How could I have been so stupid! I mean, look at me. My life is like this living room. The entire reason that I broke up with him was so I would never feel as terrible as I do right now. I... I'm gonna let you in on a little secret. When Rod proposed to me... you wanna know what I said to him? "Maybe." "Maybe"? Yeah. Probably the dumbest thing I ever said, but that's just what came out of my mouth. Maybe. Why? I was just out of law school and working these crazy hours and had a lot on my mind. But I loved him then. I love him more even now. But I really loved him. I guess... maybe I was scared, too. [sighs] The poor guy was so heartbroken that I had to explain to him and keep explaining, "I didn't mean 'maybe,' I meant 'yes.' Yes!" A thousand times, yes, but-- [sniffles] Yes, yes, a thousand times, yes. Life's just confusing sometimes, honey, and, uh... you make a mess. Yeah. But at least you cleaned yours up. You and Rod wound up together. I lost David. [sighing] Still, you know, the-- knowing that at least one of us will be happy is... it's okay. And then... [sighing] looking at you and Rod and seeing that... it's actually possible to love someone the rest of your life, it... it makes it easier, I guess. David deserves to be the... happiest person. You're a good soul, Lis. You kind of screwed up with David. You did, but... but that doesn't mean that you can't clean up your life. And you find someone who's gonna love you someday. Okay? [sniffling] Gonna miss our games. Don't you ever work? Ah, it's quiet during the holidays. Yeah, well... So, you got any job prospects lined up back home? Yes, as a matter of fact, the local college has a spring professorship open. Congratulations, Professor. Well, that'll keep me off the streets. [laughing] Glad I got that sorted out. Yeah. How about you? Your feet still chilly? What are you talking about? I proposed. Yeah, I know. Everybody gets cold feet. I saw that Kelly was a little upset the other night. She's nervous. She's great. I mean, she really is. I mean, she's beautiful. She's smart and sweet and she's funny. Yeah. She's funny. She doesn't censor herself sometimes. Has a bit of a temper, but who doesn't, right? You don't have to sell me. I'm not the one that's gonna have to spend the rest of my life with her. David... if you don't mind me saying something... You know, when all the other stuff melts away, and it will, and your knees aren't what they used to be, and you're lying in bed at the end of the night and you look over next to you, hopefully, if you're lucky enough, you see your best friend. Yeah. [Rod] Watch your back. It's so... [Rod] Watch your back. It's so... Oh, watch your knee. All right. Thanks, babe. Well, I'll be back in a few weeks for the rest of our stuff. You guys found a house in a hurry, huh? Runs in the family. Yeah, well, we're gonna stay with our daughter until we find something or she kicks us out. [Katherine laughs] Well, I'm really gonna miss you both. We're gonna miss you, too. Oh... [kissing sounds] [Katherine] Sweet girl. And you, I am gonna miss you most of all, Scarecrow. Don't blame yourself. You certainly gave your best shot. Thanks for trying. [whining] Mwah! Bye, sweetheart. You're gonna be okay. Hmm. Thank you. And Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Bye, Jake. Be a good boy. [no audible dialogue] David... I love you. Me, too. Oh. I can't believe it. How did you do it? I made a couple of phone calls. I know a lot of people in event planning, and when you said this place was booked indefinitely-- Why would they say that to me? It creates an air of exclusivity, I guess. Oh, yeah. Seems to work. Well, it is exactly what I wanted. I'm having emerald green table linens. The bridesmaids, of course, will be in emerald green as well, but you should see my dress. You already have a dress? Right here. In my head. Now, the band is gonna go here with my parents here. Uh, Chrissy, Jenny, and Michelle are gonna go here, but Aunt Dory I'm gonna stick in the back. What about David? David won't be here. Now, Dick and Marian is a whole other-- What? [sighs] We broke up. You what? We broke up. A few days ago. What-- Why? What's going on? He told me a long time ago that the thought of marriage kind of freaked him out when you pressed him. Of course, he was a lot more immature back then. [chuckles] So was I. Still, I don't know, I can't help but think maybe he rushed into things with me because I obviously have no problem with the idea of getting married at all. Yeah, but... don't you love him? 'Course I do. Come on, he's wonderful. But nothing would ruin my perfect wedding like marrying someone who doesn't actually love me. I'm sorry. Don't be. Anyway, he was right. About what? We should all marry our best friend. And someday I'm gonna do that, and you're gonna help me book this room. [chuckles] Deal? Deal. I'm gonna give you a hug now, I am. Okay. So... all right? Okay. Well, I'm glad you guys got in okay. No, I haven't heard from David. I'll let you know if I do, yes. I gotta go. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Look... I just want to say that I'm sorry. I have some wine here. For everything that I said. For being too scared... French and Italian. and not telling you how I really felt. I also have some cheese, too. I love you, David. There's that look. "That look." I don't know what-- No. No, it-- This is-- This is different. It's... It's just that I haven't seen it in a long time. Lisa... Hmm. I love you. I have a question for you. Yes. Will you... I said yes. Yes, yes. A thousand times, yes.
