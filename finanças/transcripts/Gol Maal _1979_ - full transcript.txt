Sir, my father used to say that a Kurta is for covering the outwardly shame of the body In India there are 30 million men, of which 10 million wear kurta If every man reduces the length of his Kurta even by 6 inches then with the cloth saved from that how many persons clothing problem can be solved! That's why my father used to say that wearing long clothes is a very harmful fashion - that's why he was against fashion - Was? meaning... he... Yes sir. 4 years ago, he left for his heavenly abode Its such a pity that I didn't have the fortune to meet such a great and straight thinker But he is always with me, sir.

To impress, I had argued that our father used to say "we should only wear short Kurtas" How can I break my father's command? - Yes, the Kurta is a little smaller - Little? Son. Instead of 550 you'll get a salary of 850 what about a small kurta? Even if you have to wear a vest to work you shouldn't complain Ratna, I have to discuss some important things with him, you go there Understand one thing son If you can keep Bhavani Shankar happy, you can get many things Do you know who is the "Urmilla" of "Urmilla Traders"?

Yesterday the boss asked to prepare the file for "Ahuja & Ahuja" what was the hurry? you had the entire day the file was needed in the evening No, head clerk my father used to say "Do tomorrow's work today and today's work now" On what you said A new poet of the new generation has said "Do today's work today and tomorrow's work the day after" "what's the hurry son, when you have years to live?" bravo, bravo, bravo But you didn't ask who wrote this limerick - who has written it? - This nameless has - Head clerk.

He used to say, "Bhavani, put your heart in that youngster who puts his heart into work" - there is a small matter sir - What? - Our company takes short term loans from Ahuja & Ahuja - that's right -But sir, they deduct the interest prior to giving the load -what happened? See this we borrowed 25,000 at a monthly interest of 1.5% but we got 22,750, meaning we gave an interest of 2,250 on 22,750 which means the rate of interest became 2.29% instead of 1.5%, sir In the last 5 years we have taken a loan of 500,000 from them and.. We've got 15,000 less You are right! My God!

As long as Lucky is with me, life seems so enjoyable But when he leaves, it feels like there is nothing left in life So the matter has gone this far Has he started coming in your dreams? Sometimes - what does he say when he comes? - He comes and teaches me music Brother, let me say what I've come to say. Don't interrupt in between That's your bad habit.

I came to say that these days Urmilla's signs aren't good What do you have to say? Say it clearly and frankly She mumbles at night. Yesterday, I don't know what she was mumbling taking Laxman's name - Taking Laxman's name? - Nothing wrong with the boy. But it's our Urmi who is a bit too drawn towards him I say brother. Find a nice boy and do a quick engagement and marriage But sir. What did Laxman do? No. No. I can't put any blame on Laxman But this is the thing Ram Prasad That Urmila, my daughter can't distinguish between gold and brass She doesn't know what's good for her and what's not good for her - But she should know this, right? - Naturally sir.

Don't worry at all I'll give it to him alone Let's go - Ratna... Ratna - What is it brother? Why did Urmila come? - To meet brother Laxman - What was she saying? - She has left a letter for him - Give it to me Why should I give it to you? Letter is for brother Laxman -Don't joke. -I'm not joking big brother. I promised that I'll give the letter only to younger brother - Here is your younger brother - Ok. Now I can give you - I'm dead - What happened? - She's asked to meet tomorrow at quater to 7 - So what? Meet her What meet her! I'll get to her house at 5:30 and start teaching her Studies will finish at 6:30. She'll reach that place easily in her car. But how can I change from Ram Prasad to Laxman Prasad and reach there in 15 minutes? Meet her! There's only one way Says Kabir. Be of one name. Neither Hindu neither Turkish So is it illogical to deduce from this that he doesn't take anyone's side? Saint Kabir, by comparing the religion and works of both... Why do you keep looking at the watch? Please concentrate on the studies - It's 6:30 now - Everyday it's 6:30 at this time - It's one hour. I won't study anymore - But half of the paragraph is still remaining To study Kabir, one lifetime is less but I'll try to finish by 7:30 - So, saint Kabir.... - Listen. I can't study more than an hour I get tired - But this paragraph... - We'll finish tomorrow. Goodbye -Studies over? -Yes -Have some tiffin -Today I'm in a hurry... -You're coming straight from work. You have to eat. Brother's command. What's the hurry? - I'm very hungry - Ok, ok. Eat, eat. I'll get some more - So you're here. - Go, go. I'm late. Chandan cinema Brother in law.

I say, open the door What happened brother? What happened? See, I was going in. A guy called me brother in law and I stopped He went inside and closed the door. Is this the way? - His need was greater than yours - Meaning what? Meaning, his need was more pressing than yours What are you saying? Helen has started dancing and singing. I still couldn't hold it. You are saying that his need was more than mine? - Thank you brother in law - 'Saala' [swear word] -What did you say? -Brother, he called me brother in law so isn't he my 'Saala' [also mean's wife's brother] - Correct - Mr. Saala, may I ask something?

We can't talk here. Let's meet at Juhu beach tomorrow. Ok? Those who meet don't meet. In reality, only those meet who don't meet. Because what is, isn't there and what isn't there, is there This isn't merely a play of words And even if its a play, it is the vision and within this meeting or not meeting, being or not being, lies the ocean of illusion [Once, this moment fell from time somewhere] [There I found this tale. The moment is nowhere.] [By making you laugh a little. By making you cry a little.] [This moment is also about to go.] [The soon to come moment is about to go] [If you can, live your life in this] [moment that is about to go.] [The soon to come moment is about to go] - But why is he coming to meet me again today? - I don't know Yesterday, in the office he suddenly said "I'll come to meet your mother" "I've very important work" I don't like this anymore.

Then shout a lot!... Scream a lot! There is Laxman's gain in it -Laxman's gain? -Yes -How's that? Brother, if your blood pressure rises, you'll have cerebral haemorrhage And if you have cerebral haemorrhage, you will die And when you die, Your wealth will go to Urmilla. To Laxman..Shout!....Shout! - Then I won't shout - Bhavani, I know Laxman very well - He is naughty but he isn't a vagabond or hooligan - yes, he is! You're shouting again? He is.
