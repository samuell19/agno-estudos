The fear in the dark... In that pIace deep inside us and we don't wanna pass... It's coming from that place again... bringing another terror time to the city. The evil is walking around. Terrible things can be happening in the other house. He knows everything. When a terribIe story happen... you are sure that he is nearby. Down ages, unknown and... inconceivable things... have been the biggest polemic of humanity. But l've never given my opinion. l've been the vigilant of the human beings. But l never interfere in anybody's fate. The story that l'll tell you, veredical or not, I don't mind because l have witnesses, so it's in my life. The character of this story lived on earth a short time ago... and she had a girl's face, naive... the real innocence's symbol. Perhaps you've crossed with her on the street. But her maligntrace was followed by sadness... anguish, violence and death. But, of course, the title was created from this nymphet... and couldn't be another: "The daughter of Horror" THE COFFIN JOE TALE: The daughter of Horror Ah, I don't know why we don't live in the city. To stay here in this ranch, far from everything. It takes us one hour to arrive in the city. Nothing new happens here. It's always the same thing. If I hadn't sworm in our wedding that I would be with you in the hapiness and sadness, I'd have gone away. I'd have lived with our son in Sao Paulo. -Oh, poor boy. -What did you say? I said I miss our boy. He was smart leaving our house early. Smart? Very smart! Sometimes the best thing to do is to leave. I like having fun! This quite life is very boring. I'm young, beautiful... I need more excitment. A life... a life full of adventure. Hey, Leda. Take that red silk dress in the wardrobe. Dress it, take the car and go to Alvarenga's farm. When you arrive there, run through the pasture among the bulls. You'll have adventure for the whole month. You're making a fool of me. You never listen to me! Someday I'll dress my new dress and I'll look for adventure. But it won't be in Alvarenga's farm. And I'm tired of doing the housework alone. Look my hands! Look how they are! They're destroyed! And besides this I'm alergic of detergent. Be calm! You sister is sending us that girl from Salvador to help you. So, when she arrives your life will change. Ah, I've already forgotten. Did you ask your brother to -pick her up in the bus station? -Yes. Yes. -Good morning! -Good morning! Gee! You've left that bedroom. I thought that you've died there. Leda, don't bother Egidio! Hey brother! Everything ok? A new book? What are you reading now? "Contos da Noite Macabra", Jos? Mojica Marins. Cool! Are you enjoying it? Why don't you read a normal thing? Cartoons, magazines... -This is very good, Leda. -Isn't time to pick the girl up... in the bus station? What's her name? I don't know. Maria something. Maria das Dores... Maria Concei??o. Name of poor people is always the same. -Maria lmaculada. Ai! -What's up? -I've cut my finger. -Ah! Suck. My God! What's up? Be calm, be calm. I'll take something to put on your finger. It's not serious, Leda. It's just a short cut. Put your hand up and don't drip blood on the floor. I'll be back in a second. Ah, I'll pick the girl up. Oh, Egidio! Take care on the road. Your brother with this terror mania will end in a sanatorium. Put this piper out, Amauri. This smoke is very bad for my throat! Godness sake you arrived! So, you're Maria Imaculada. Nice to meet you. I'm Amaury. Did you have a good trip? What's up? A cat ate your tongue? She's scared, Leda! The man who travaled besides her, died. -God! -That's true. -Dead? -Do nobody know? Nobody knows how he died, Amaury. Didn't you see anything, Imaculada? Ah, she said that she slept all the time, Amaury. -It shouldn't be easy, should it? -Yes. -My finger is blooding again. -Come here, come. I'll show you where you're going to stay. -Bring her suitcase, Egidio. -Ok, I'll take. She was a girl like others. An innocent girl... coming back from school on the small deserted road... witch goes to her parent's house so far from the city. In a curve, she faced with strange men that pulled her... into a car and, after that to to the dark end of the forest. There, like animals, they pull away her clothes... they lay her on the floor and the orgy starts. Animal possession. Lots of hands... mouths that run her body at the same time. All the parts of her body are touched, squeezed, pressed. Shouts of pain. Lots of penetrations. At the same time, monstrous sadism... Sex without compassion. Blood, sperm, saliva, all mixtured on that fragile body. The torture doesn't finish. She can't shout. she just sobs. The evil pleasure of those demoniac men doesn't end up. She seems to be almost dead. When their animal desire ends up they go away. They abandon her body on the grass and she dies alone there. But her tormented soul, marked by fear... vacates on earth with feeling of hate for all men. Look! There are shoe stains on the floor. You can start making the lunch. Don't put much salt on the food, because Amauri has a heart problem. And besides this, he suffers by high blood pressure. I'll separate some clothes to be washed. I'll be back soon. I've just separated the clothes. I've put these flowers here right now. Poor Leda. She couldn't imagine that beneath that maid's skin lived all evil's power. Strange things started to happen in that house. In the garden, never more the flowers were seen. At night, poisonous animals were around. It was the beggining. Terrible things would happen. Egidio, I must finish these four bookcases until the end of the week to that man. If I don't finish, he'll find another supplier. Egidio, Egidio! I'm talking to you. Wake up. I was thinking about the book I'm reading. Ok, you can think about it but don't stop working. It's a very cool story. Would you like to listen? Ok, you can tell me, but don't stop working. It's a story of a girl who was raped when she was coming back from school. Oh, poor girl. They made horrible things with her... and left her abandonded on the grass. God! She died of cold, hunger and hemorrhage. Her soul was so full of hate that it didn't leave the earth. Then her soul incorporated another girl... and went to avenge against the rapers. Egidio, all these stories finish in the same way. Yes, but she didn't wanna avenge only against the rapers. She hates men. Do you know what she used to do? No. She used to incorporate girls and seduce men. After that, she used to kill then. Ok. Give me another piece of wood. Amauri, look your finger. That's impossible! It's blooding again! I cut my finger a week ago and it didn't cicatrized yet. Oh, Imaculada, don't worry about it. Egidio, the blood disappeared! It's really weird! Be calm, Leda. Be calm. How did that rat appear in my drawer, Amauri? Oh, Leda. Maybe you've made a confusion! Egidio went there to take the rat out. The maid is guilt! She doesn't do anything right. Calm down, Leda. Calm down. So, did you take out the rat? What rat? There isn't any rat there. I'm sure there is. It's there, in the first drawer. I saw it! It's a big rat! Your brother is getting crazy. The drawer is open but there isn't any rat there. -I'll go there to take a look. -But it's not possible, Egidio! The rat was there, died. I've put my hands on it. Am I getting crazy? People, there isn't anything there. Leda, do you know what's happening? You're spending a long time at home. You need to go out to have some fun. When you stay at home, you see things. But it was there, I'm sure. Be calm, Leda. Be calm. Amauri, a calling for you. Ah, my son! Hello! Hi, my boy! How are you? Ok? You're coming tomorrow. That's good! Are you engaged? You're kidding! Engaged? He is a child! Your mother loved the new. What time do you arrive tomorrow? At night? Egidio will pick up. Bye, see you tomorrow! Marcilio and Claudia are coming tomorrow... to spend a week with us. Leda, please, behave! Claudia is a saint. Don't bother her. She is the best woman to get married with our son. A saint, I see. This girls with saint's face are the most dangerous. But don't worry because I won't bite the girl. Ok, I'll walk around the ranch. Somebody goes with me? Me? I'll fix my son's bedroom. Me? I'll read my book. Ok. I'll go out alone again. Oh, my Lord, thanks for putting a so nice... so honest girl in my son's life. I would like that he gets married in this chapel. But, of course, just if they allow. I'd like that you look after Leda. She's not a bad person but she loves troubles. And Egidio? He was always the weird of the family... but he has a big heart. Oh my Lord. Give me power to go on helping him. Oh, lmaculada. Come in. You can. Nobody will hurt you. Yes, will do. Who? Excuse me, are you new here? No, my son, I'm just passing. How did you arrive here? I didn't see any car. Sometimes we can't see the ways of God! I'd like that you stay with this. It'll protect you. Never be away from this. Thanks. Good luck. No my darling. No today. I have a terrible headache. Amauri, what's this? Did you forget what's this? Where are you going? To the bathroom. Who were you dreaming with? With you, Leda. I'd like you stay with this medal. It'II protect you. Never be away of this. So, my son. When are you getting married? Get married? But who said this, Amauri? If they are engaged they will get married. Of course, dad. But I'm waiting to finish the University. But it's next year, my son. Leda, if they love each other... why are they going to wait so much? Look, your coffee is very good. And you, Leda. Are you enjoying the life in the ranch? Ah, I'm living. And your gardensm mom? I can't see any flower around the house. They died and I don't know why. You know, I ordered a water analysis to see if there's someting wrong. The flowers around the house are dying and the big trees either. Marcilio, the animals too. The other day I was walking around the lake and l found a lot of dead birds. And this girl. She always goes to the lake. She adores swimming with clothes. I tried to warn her that the water is very bad. But she doesn't listen to me. You know, one day I'll ask to bless this house. Why don't you talk to the new priest? What new priest, Amauri? That chapel doesn't have a priest for months. I saw a new priest in the chapel a few days ago. Impossible, Amauri. If there was a new priest in the chapel, we would see him. People, stop! She'll think that it's a ghost ranch. I'll go to the city... to take some blessed water, anyway. My darling, don't be scared. Egidio believe in ghosts, sobrenatural things. Nothing bad will happen her in the ranch. Father or son? Who Maria Imaculada will seduce first? One death is coming. I can hear the death's steps. A terrible death will happen in that ranch... and nobody can prevent. Hi, Claudia. I was looking at the lake. -It's wonderful. -I see. Claudia, wait. Claudia, I didn't have a bad intention. When I realised, I was looking. I wanna go away. I told my father that we will be here for a week. You'll be alone. You're jealous. I adore you. I have a strange feeling in this place. A pressentiment. There's something telling me that we must go away. You're jealous. If you want, I don't get close to that girl. Ok, ok, I know. Only after the wedding. It's ok for me. I'm going away. I adore you. That night was possible to feel the presence of death. Weird sounds outside the house. Oh my God, help me. Ghost's voice were evoking the death. Kill the girl, kill the girl. Kill the girl, kill the girl. Maybe the electric key fell. Electric keys don't fall, Leda. Maybe it's a bad contact. I'll go outside to take a look. Will I be in this darkness alone? Be calm, Leda. It'll be fast. Kill the girl, kill the girl. I knew this. Bad contact. Switched on. -You're so beautiful today. -Oh, Marcilio. I've had a very strange dream. I need to tell you. Are you kidding? Me too. But I can't remember my dream. I dreamed that a horrible girl came into my bedroom. It seemed that she was spanked. She had black eyes. What is the most strange is that there was blood flowing off between her legs. She was holding a knife. I woke up sweating. I was horrified. When it happens agains, run to my bed. Oh, boy, you never give up, do you? -What's up? -Mrs. Leda is calling you. Ok, you gave the message. Go away. I said go away, leave us alone. Egidio, desperated, was trying to convince Amauri that what was happening in the house was the same in the book. But Amauri didn't believe. Such as the proverb... "see to believe". Do you wanna know what come after death? Oh, it's very simple: just die. -Marcilio, may I put this on you? -What's this? French perfum? -No, blessed water. -Stop please. But the way, I'll take a shower. She'll think that everybody is crazy in this house. Stop please. Everybody is getting crazy with your stories. May I see this bottle, uncle? Stop. Oh, my blessed water. I think that I ate too much. I'm sorry uncle. Mom, is there cacha?a here? May I drink a little? Yes, there is. Wait a minute that I'll take for you. -Thanks. -Are you sure that you're ok? Of course. Everything is ok. Mom, it's delicious. Put a little. Sure. Marcilio, you've never drink. You told that he's not a child anymore. What's up, Claudia? There's blood in the shower. Blood? Be calm. Maybe some land got into the water-tank. Be calm. The water is normal. Maybe there's some dirt in the water. Let's take a look in the water-tank, Egidio. Be calm, my dear, be calm. You're shocked with Egidio's stories. I wanna go away. You've promissed to stay. Mom, we talk later. Marcilio, wake up, wake up. What's this? My God! Nothing mom. I couldn't sleep so I came here. I think that I drank too much. If your father knows this, he'll be really angry. He doesn't need to know. He doesn't need to know. It'll be our secret. Ok, ok, my dear. Brush the teeth while. I'll make a coffee for you. -What's this Claudia? -You said that we'd go away. I said but not today. But you promissed. Exactly. I promised to my mother to stay one week and I'll stay. -I'll take to her. -Don't mind. She'll be calm in a few seconds. She's our guest. I'll talk to her. I like this, my dear. You must show her who is the leader. Poor Claudia. She could go away from that condened place, alone. But she didn't go. Her fiance, Marcilio, was getting crazy day by day. Crazy for drink... and the maid's body. One day, Claudia found them together... and she did something... that she should never has done. It's unbelivable that in this life there are so... innocent things that can become so fatal. Marcilio. Your father is going to the city tomorrow and I go with him. You're scurvy! You're repulsive! You'll be here forever. -Let's go, Leda.. -I'm going, I'm going. I wanna buy boots in the mall. Marcilio, what are you doing here? -Let him here. -He'll be sick, Amauri. He takes care. Are you sure that you don't wanna go with us? No, no. I'm tired of S?o Paulo. You mother will go shopping and we'll come back soon. Doesn't Claudia wanna go? That's strange because Claudia didn't have... -breakfast today. -Don't worry. I'll talk to her later. If you want, mon can stay with you. No. Let him with her. They have to talk. Imaculada, I can't do what you asked me. Yes, you can. Go there and do what I ordered now. You can shout. There isn't anyone here. -Why are you doing this? -Shut up! Please, don't do this to me! Are you afraid, little virgin? Yes. I love you. Please think about what you're doing. You're not like this. You don't know me. Marcilio, we've arrived. My godness sake! -We need call the police. -We can't do this. You saw that he killed the girl Leda. Promise that you won't call the police. What happened to Marcilio? I don't know, I don't know. But he's our son and we can't call the police. What are we gonna do, Leda? Call Egidio. We must bury that body in some place. But it's not right. But he raped that girl and you saw. -l'll cal the police. -No, no. Do you know what they do to rapers in prision? You won't call anyone. We'll save Marcilio together. You're his father, Amauri. And you know that he won't survive in prison. Ok. Let's bury the girl. Oh God, forgive me. To protect their son, they took the body to a wood behind the house. They digged a deep hole and put her body there. But now Marcilio was completely crazy and The Daughter of Horror decide that Amauri would be her next victim. But Amauri was a very strong man. And above all he was protected for a while. We must go away. They'll look for Claudia. Be calm, let me think. We can't take the car and drive away without destine. Let's try to sleep and tomorrow we try... to find a solution. And Marcilio? He's in his bedroom. He doesn't talk. He's looking at the ceiling and crying. Let's try to sleep and tomorrow we decide. And lmaculada? Maybe she saw something. It's very strange because since we arrived I didn't see her. She's dangerous, Amauri. You must belive me. Since she arrived, strange things have been happening... in this ranch. The flowers! I've just separeted the clothes. I've put these flowers here right now! What flowers? All the flowers died after she arrived. And the tree beside her bedroom is completely dry. And the animals? The animals were died next to the lake. Hey people, be calm. We're nervous. -We're seeing things. -l don't know, Amauri. l think you have to talk to her. The best thing to do is dismiss her. -Be calm. -She's very dangerous. And please Leda, don't mess with her. Be calm. Tomorrow l'll talk to lmaculada. Let's try to sleep now. l'm really tired. lmaculada, lt's me, Marcilio. Open the door. lmaculada. Did you hear this? Of course. lt's Marcilio shouting to lmaculada. Where is he now? Let's go there and pick him up. Let's go. Knocking on lmaculada's door? lmaculada, open the door. l wanna talk to you. What light is this? You're setting fire in the bedroom? My God! ls that Claudia ring? Egidio was right! You're behind everything. Pack you things. Tomorrow l won't see you here. lf something happens to my son... l'll follow you to the hell. "Fucking voodoo"! Marcilio, my son. How is he? He's ok but we must go away as fast as possible. l've been to her bedroom. lt's horrible. There are lots of black candles, an altar. Leda, for Godness sake, you didn't mess with her, did you? l asked her to pack her things and go away. You can't do it. Did you see it, Leda? This is not Marcilio. Did you see the hate in his eyes? My son would never attacked me. We must go away and take him to a priest. -Priest? -Yes. Egidio was right. lt's something of Devil. l'm having a bad feeling. Let's go away while there's time. Be calm. Go packing our things because l have something to do. Die all. Waht are you looking for, Amauri? No, amauri. What are you doing to do? Be calm. This girl will go away today in anyway. Don't worry. l won't do anything with her. l'll just frighten her. Pack our things cause l'll come back soon. She won't let us to go away. l'm sure that she'll do something against us. l must find. lt might be here. l found it. The death has cut the first head. All of them in that house were taking a big risk. The terror show has just started. That's impossible. l have to find a way to kill that woman. Oh my God! Help me! So, he staked on her heart a dagger blessed by spirits. The Daughter of Horror cried and all lost souls shaked. But where did he get this dagger? Where? ln the dark of the night the rider of fear came to him. Under that black cover, he was bringing his blessed... dagger and he gave it to him as a gift of his faith. Die all. lmaculada... l want you out of this ranch right now. But this is Amauri's mountain. My God, oh my god! Help me! Actually, l don't have all this courage Who is that bentleman of history world? Where can l find this dagger blesed by spirits? l want you to leave this site right now. lf you don't go, l... Amauri! Come. l know what you want. Come. Help me, help me, rider of fear. Wherever you are, help me. Help me. Let you mother free. -Egidio! -Amauri! -Where's Leda? -She's dead. -And Marcilio? -He's dead. Let's go away from here before lmaculada comes here. Be calm. She is not here. Did you kill her? No. She was already dead. Let's go away. Nobody will believe us. The'll think that we're crazy, that we killed everybody. That's true. We have to disappear for a while. But l have to go to the chapel before. Why? I think that the chapel is a good place to put it back. Let's go. Let's go away, Egidio. Let's go away. What's up, Egidio? Strange. I'm sure that I've seen someone sitting here. Egidio, for Godness sake, don't star with this again. -Let's go away. -I'm sure. -I'm sure. -Let's go away. Keep this very well because we can still need it. And what about me, I am going to stay here. Careful! Evil has a lot of mask and it's close to you. No one's safe. By the way, you are not thinking in hire a maid, are you?
