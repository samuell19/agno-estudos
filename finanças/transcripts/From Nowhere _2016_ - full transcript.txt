Please stop throwing those, unless you want to stay after and clean up my room. Thank you. OK, settle down, please. Excuse me. Settle down, please. Bobby, can you bring me that phone? Bring me the phone, please. You can pick it up at the office end of the day. Selfie! Just one, just one! I was just... Mhm. Sit down, sit down. OK, so nothing here is as it seems. Like Edgar, who seems... Ladies, are you taking notes? Yeah! Can I have that, please? I'll take both of them, thank you. Oh, um, OK. Can you take your hat off? Just as Edgar, who seems weak in the beginning of the play, compared to his power-crazy brother Edmund, he turns out to be one of the heroes of the play, but only after he's disguised as Poor Tom. Eventually, he stands up to his brother. He tells him the truth, and he kicks his butt. It's like the guy said in the article... Hand, please. Yes,. That's like what the guy said in the article that you gave us last week. Which guy? The Wilde guy. The Wilde guy said a lot of stuff. Which are you talking about? Yeah, but he said, um... Oscar Wilde. Yes. He says, uh, "Give a man a mask" and he'll tell you the truth." It's like Edgar. Edgar's only going to... tell you the truth if he's pretending to be somebody he's not. And I'm pretending to be someone who gives a shit about this. Bobby, I've heard enough from you for one day, OK? If I hear from you again, you're going to the office. Please don't make me send you to the office. I'm sorry. That's exactly like Edgar. Thank you. Just as the fool is probably the sanest person in King Lear, Edgar is maybe the most authentic, even though he's hiding his real self from the world. Well done. So I found these online. They're private scholarships for college. Rich families who don't ask for a social security number. - Thank you. - Mm-hmm. And there are copies there for Sophie and Alyssa, also. All right. You guys have your meeting today in Manhattan, right? Yeah. How you feeling? All right. We'll see what he says. Well, he's a good guy, so let me know what happens, OK? Tell me, why is it you're the only one who does the extra reading I give the class? Well, my sister never lets me watch what I want on TV, so what else am I going to do? Genocide is good. Genital mutilation also helps. Dictator's the best. Not going lie to you, this is not going to be easy, and each of your cases is obviously very different. I asked Jackie if I could meet with you together initially, but we'll be meeting separately from now on, you know, one on one. But just for today, I assume you all trust each other? I trust them more than I trust you. That's understandable. So, here's the deal. There has to be an official history of violence or abuse toward your family in your country of origin. Murders, disappearances, incarcerations of at least one of your relatives. I have to stress to the judge that you put one foot back in that border and you are done with. Now, political asylum isn't the only way to go, but it's my understanding it's best for, you know, young people like you. So, let's see we got. Moussa? Moussa? Yep. And don't do your prepared thing, you know. I don't want to know your whole life story, just tell me the facts that can help. Well, I didn't know that I was illegal until last year, my junior year. That's when I needed my social security number to apply to colleges. My mom brought my sister and I here to America, the Bronx, when I was... about 10 years ago. She said that it was to get a real education and to get my sister's eyes fixed. She has trouble seeing. But it was all... There were just some other reasons, too. Such as? All right. I mean, we can handle this in our one on one. Her husband. My sekou my step father. He was already here. We came here to join him. And about a year after we got here, like right after my mom had my little brother, sekou, he left. He went back to Guinea. He took on another wife. He lied about having papers. Mm-hmm. He just lied about everything, and so he left us here with nothing. Great, great. That's a good start. Alyssa? Alyssa? Um, I can't remember it, to be honest. I was too young. We flew out on my dad's work permit when I was four and my sister Lola was nine. My dad worked for the airlines, and my mom had to come to the US a year before. So Lola had to make a decision for both of us. My mother here, or my father there. And my aunt, my mom's sister, she lives in Miami, and she told Lola not to look at it as choosing parents, but choosing a good job, and college, and living in a house with electricity. So when we landed in JFK, no one was there to meet us. And then Lola found out that my mom was at her babysitting job, and she was scared to tell her boss about her own baby's arrival. So, Lola stood there with me, terrified. She thought she made a mistake. And, I mean, it was too late. We couldn't go back. So, she chose wrong. Sorry, Alyssa. Sorry, two seconds. Sorry. Hey, Murray. Where we at? Yeah. No, I know that. No, I know. That, that's not the point. No, this is not... No, we're not going to start talking like we're going to do a trade-off with exchange students. This is a international communications company, and if they want these specialists in the country, they're going to have to do the paperwork to get it done. Yeah, now, I'm aware of that. Hey, Murray, my case, my call. OK? You're just there in the media as my proxy today. I'd be there, but I... I have this... Murray, look. Do what I'm saying, OK? Do what I'm saying, OK? Great. Thank you, go. OK. I should... OK. Sophie, go. My sister has papers, though. She married an American guy, Chris, he's great. And my aunt is covering her college tuition. My mom has a layaway for me. Um, I really want to major in medical technology, so. Yeah. Great. Sophie. Go. You got a girlfriend? No. You want me to find a girlfriend? No. I could, no problem. There are women, like, all over my projects. Not just the ugly, dirty, desperate ones that would take anybody. You want me to sort something out, I can. OK. So, for the next time we meet, uh, on one on one, I want you guys to go ahead and bring me in a list of the names of all your family that are still in the old country. Dates of disappearances, murders, incarcerations, like I said. The picture we have to paint for the judge is that, you know, you guys go back there, you're buried. Newspaper clippings, or links to websites, you know, newspaper websites. What about, like, straight As? I heard that helps when you apply. Um, like, what if you're like the smartest kid in your class, and have perfect attendance, does that help? It's more about genocide, genital mutilation, and dictators. So, until you meet next time, don't do anything wrong. I mean, swipe your metro card. That means you're buying things you need. Buy quickly, don't gather in groups in the street... Yeah, we know, man. No you don't. Nobody knows how to handle this situation. We're all just, you know, schlumping along as best we can. That's not what I mean. Schlump. What is the... What is the... Shlep. Schlep. Do you think that guy was focused? I hope he knows what he's doing. Yo, he better. I hear the food in the detention center sucks. Amadou, come here. Come here! Oh, Amadou, come here, you messy boy. Hello, Mina. Amadou, it's bath time. Amadou! Armina, please, all this noise. I can't hear myself think. Turn this down, now. Armina! Amadou, Amadou, stop jumping on that bed. OK, five minutes and then bath time. Amadou will wake up the landlord, and we don't have this month's or last month's rent. Amadou, please, stop jumping, OK? What do you think we should do, huh? Armina? I spent the entire day getting six girls ready for a birthday party. Oh. They pay you well? Psh, no. Just $50 take home. Tomorrow I have ten. A wedding party. The bride sent me pictures of exactly what she wants. It should be $200 and tips. Brides are the most generous. They think they may actually be happy. $200 and we're still short. I don't know which one is better, give him the 200 and have him remember that we owe more, or just wait until we have everything. Armina? Pay him the 200. Pretend that we are trying. Maybe he'll feel sorry for us. Hello! My man Amadou! Oh, I've got you. Bodyslam! How was your day in school, Amadou? - Good. - All right. Hey, Mama, has anyone in our family been murdered or locked up? What? What are you talking about? Amadou, come here. Go get ready for bath time. In Guinea. Has any of our family been locked up or murdered? Stop, stop. Don't talk like that. How did you go with the lawyer? We need to... The lawyer is almost a guarantee. Two cousins on my father's side, they hired a lawyer and then they have their papers. And they have a friend, I think she's from Guinea too, she's now studying to be a doctor in Pennsylvania. She's not even as smart as you are. Oh boy, oh boy. What? Please don't tell me you believe those fantasies. Fantasies? Everybody knows how it really is for us. What are you talking about? When you walk down the street near a police officer, eyes down on the pavement. You can't travel by bus because you need an ID. What's your name? Where are you from? Where are you going? Normal questions for everyone except us. Well, sekou will help us. Will he? Armina. What? How? How will the great sekou help us? He would do anything for us. He's making a lot of money at the moment. Where? The borders. Which borders? Armina. He's selling purses and shoes and bags. Where, Mama? Which borders? All those things that people want in those big cities. - Which big cities? - Armina! How much money has he sent you from these great sales, Mama? Armina, all I have to do is ask him. So ask him! I'm serious, Mama. Ask him. Let's see how much money the great sekou will send us. He would never desert his family. Which family? This one, or his new one? He's so far away. He's forgotten all about us. No matter far away he is, he is still my husband. Yeah, and He went and got a new wife. And I am still your mother. Amadou! Amadou! Bath time. What? Sophie! Sophie! Hey. Hey! Gracias, Sophie. De nada. OK. Pizza! Pizza! You're not going to just sit there and whisper in front of me. That's rude. We're doing work. We were just talking, it had nothing to do with you. We're having a conversation. What's her name? What's her name? I'm not telling you what her name is. Don't make me go through roll call. - What's her name? - You don't have to do that. She ain't going through roll call. You don't have to do that. Listen... Brianna? Why would I tell... Ashley? Maybe it's Nicole. Nicole? What is wrong with... Like... Melissa? Yo, could you guys shut up, please? Thank you. Could you mind your business, please? Are you confused? No need to be mean, OK? What the hell? Is she your keeper? That's your mama? Did she adopt you? I'm not being mean, I'm simply reacting. She's my friend! Why, how? Because she is. None of your business. Alyssa? She never did anything to me! Oh my God, I'm about to ram this fucking pencil down your throat. Do it! I fucking dare you! No, let it roll. Let it roll. I wonder what the fucking is for. Why? She's not even worth it. She's not even worth it. Hello, Louie. Hello, darling, is Moussa home? - No. - He's not here? - No, why? - All right, good. You can't just walk into our apartment! - My. - What? It's my apartment. Until you pay the rent, then it becomes your apartment. - That's how it works. - Sh, sh, sh. So he's not here? No. All right, good. 'Cause I don't need little Rambo trying to save the day, and I gotta call the cops. Close the door, sweetheart. You want the whole fucking building to hear our conversation? Six weeks? I know. Do you? - Yes. - I got bills to pay. - I've got a family. - I know, I'm sorry. Are you? Yes. Get it. - Get what? - Yankee tickets. The money, what do you think? OK. I know, it's my fault. You're 300 short. I know, it's my fault. You're 300 short. I know. I was waiting until we had all of it. And you were hoping I'd forget until you did. Yes. Well, I remembered. This what you got? Yes. Is it? All right, the rest in two weeks or you're OK. Fuck it. This is everything you got? Yes. Take it. I'm a Catholic. I can't sit upstairs and think of you two not having food for two weeks. I got enough to feel guilty about. But I meant what I said. Everything in two weeks or I gotta kick you out. I don't want to be this guy. You leave me no choice. You're making me be this guy who I don't like. Two weeks. Thank you, Louie. Your word against mine. Come on, I saw you. Saw me what? I saw you take that laptop off of the cart and put it in your bag. Whatever. It's your word against mine. Sophie, I'm a teacher. Jackie, I'm an orphan. You know what? Don't push me, OK? A smart girl recognizes when someone's on her side. This... I can tell you what this is. If the school police caught you, instead of me, you'd be sitting in custody right now, being shipped back to the DR within the week. Does that sound good to you? No prom. Goodbye, all your friends. No graduation. You're not going to college. You need to start trusting someone. I don't even know why Moussa told you in the first place. Because he needed help, and he thought you and Alyssa did, too. When are you going to Isaac's again? Shit, what does it matter? Don't swear in my class again. As if they're going to give papers to someone like me. They're not going to give you papers if you keep stealing things. I can tell a mouse died in this fucking room. It's like shriveled, like a cafeteria's french fries. Swear in my class again... Swear in my class again, I'm telling you right now, I'm putting you in detention. Oh my God, detention, oh no. Sit down. Sophie, sit down, please. Sit down! Sit down! I can't pay for the lawyer, Jackie. I know that. I know that. I spoke to Isaac, he's happy to help for free. And worst comes to worst, this goes on, I can help you. I don't want your charity. Am I interrupting? Nope. Come on in, Alyssa. I had something I wanted to show both of you, anyway. Brochures for City College. It's pretty, right? Looks like Harvard. What would I know what Harvard looks like? If you've ever seen Harvard in a movie, it was probably filmed at City College. This is beautiful, but don't colleges check immigration status? Listen, if every City College in New York got rid of their students without papers, they would have lecture halls filled with rows and rows of empty seats. Give one to Moussa, too. Bitch. What are you talking about? She's trying to help us. She's trying to be fucking Mother Teresa. I like her. You like everybody. Well, I'm not liking you right now. Come on. Let's go see what the idiot's up to. Probably with Sarah. Sarah the psycho? She's not that bad. She's so annoying. Even her body isn't worth it. Actually, it kind of is. I know. I missed this. So? So what? Is it me? You'll have to choose. Do I have to choose right now? Once I leave, I'm not coming back. You have to know that. I'm not going to be in the mountains of Afghanistan or a desert in Iraq or anything. Camping out with some dirty, unshaven men. I'm gonna be on a cozy base in Georgia. All by myself, cute little car. Buzz around the city. I'm not coming back here. Not even for you. You lose if you don't sign on now. You'll miss these beautiful lips. Come with me. Sign up with me. Baby, it ain't that simple. No, it is. No. No it's not. Look, I have to take care of my family. I need you to need me. And I do. I need you to need me more. Baby, I do. Then why have you never once invited me to your house to meet your mom? To meet this family you love so much? I get asked out almost every day by the boys from schools in our neighborhood. Most of them have jobs. That wasn't a threat. I don't want them. I want you. Don't you get that? Bae, it's not like I can just say to them, you figure out how to fill in the bank checks. You figure out how to pay the bills. How to sign the doctor forms. I read for them. I see for Them I sign for them, and I speak for them. OK. I get it. Why did I fall for such a little baby attached to his family. Yo, don't talk about my family. Why not? That's all you ever talk about. Sorry. We were just coming in here to... We were done. Lunch. Are we still hanging out tonight? I don't know. Just tell her the truth. Don't do that. What if she gets angry and they break up, and she wants to get even? She wouldn't do that. Only a crazy person would do something like that. You should just marry her. No, I'm serious! She'd marry you in a second, you'd get the papers, and then you'd be good. That's it. Everyone knows what fake marriage is like. Immigration, they grill you until you slip up. What kind of lotion does she wear? What's it smell like? - Moussa, you're her boyfriend. Don't you know what she smells like? I'm going to the cafeteria before all the food goes out. My whole family, they used to brag about him. They said if we ever got into any trouble then, you know, he could help us. But when he came to stay with us, I think what I was like seven, he kind of spooked us all. What do you mean, spooked? He would always get me to ask them about torture. He said that he was an expert in it, and it was about the best way to get anyone to tell you anything. Hm. Um well, he got kicked off the police force and I'm not sure why. Is that what you mean? - No, I need more. I mean, a lot more. Like how high up was he? Did people generally know his name? Was he in jail? Is he alive? Is he still in Guinea? You know, you gotta help me out here. He was a captain, I think. And he got away with his three wives and his five kids before they could catch him. I mean, do you want me to tell you what country he's in? Or where he is now? - No, no, no, no, no. Don't tell me where he is, because I'd be obligated to tell the judge if he asked me about it. Oh. Sorry. I normally wouldn't do this, but I have to take this. - Do you mind? - Do you want... Hey. Listen, I'm, um, I can't talk right now, I'm with a client, but... How'd it go? Yeah? What'd he say? That's great! Oh, God, what a relief. Yeah, no, I should get back to this meeting, but I can stop by after work, OK? Yeah, a tuna sandwich. Right. No, no, I really... I really, I can't talk. Yeah, you too. OK, bye. All right. Mothers. Tell me about it. Look, this story's not enough. Not for asylum. All we have right now is you're the nephew of some unknown policeman, but we need something else. I don't know if I can get anything else. Find something. Are you awake? No. Tell me what happened at the lawyer today, please. It's pointless. Don't say that it's pointless. Tell me what happened. We have to get facts and dates and pages and pages of them. OK. Letters from people that we cannot find. I don't understand why Mama wouldn't do this before we came here. That is the last thing she was thinking of. We are always the last thing she's thinking of. Why do you have to be so mean to her? I don't. Whatever. You know, Mama and I hear you on the phone, Moussa, talking to your friends in a thick American accent. Like what we offer to other people, or, um, just the qualities that we have and what we can give to others kind of identifies as ourselves. Very good. All right, let's hear your thing. I'm not someone who wants to sit around and talk about myself, that's for sure. I'm just asking for three, Tina. Artist? Sure, artist. I'm logical. What? I'm logical. I am. I don't know, and I'm a realist. Great. Yeah. Bobby? I'm the shit. Bobby. You just listened to some other examples. Give me three for you. I'd probably say cool. OK. Um, flirtatious. And, uh... Ooh, he got a smile! Stop it! What about... what about you? You're awfully quiet over there. I'm compassionate. I'm hard working. And I'm lit! Yeah! Yes, yes, very good. Very good. I don't... Oh, that was... That was... that was actually a solid interception. I don't want to be picking these up. I don't want to be picking these up all afternoon. That was a solid interception, right. That was pretty good. That was pretty good. That was pretty good. Teacher's got game. All right, all right, all right. Don't even, don't even! You can check out Kerry Washington, but you know I'm gonna be checking out Idris Elba. Idris? Yes. Come on, Idris? Stupid. Oh, come on. Oh, please. Oh, he aight? Oh. Hey. Hey. - Hey. - Hey. OK, that's done. Can we go, baby, I'm hungry. No. You aight? Yeah, I'm fine. Moussa, I said I'm hungry. Just hold on one second. Hey, girl! I didn't know you were in the theater! This is why I wanted to go. Hey, bitches. Hey! You see that dreadful movie? Oh, but Idris? Yeah, girl. Come on. Oh, the Bobby? No. What's going on? Nothing, I just, I'm just going for a walk. You sure? Yeah, shit, what is this, a fucking interrogation? What, Tiffany? Did I say something to you? No, good choice. We just obviously have two different fashion senses. Yeah, we obviously do. I mean, you don't get dressed for nothing. School, work, not even church. Well, I'm not desperately trying to get Bobby to let me suck him off, Tiffany. So maybe it's a matter of what you getting dressed up for, you know? What did you just say to me? Yo, Sophie, you're a fucking bitch. Yo, you need to just stay out of it. Or what? Why are you standing up for her? Sarah. Nobody else will. Because she's a little freak. Hey, uh, Bobby, which one of the bitches you gonna be fucking tonight? Who the fuck are you calling a bitch? Fuck you! Don't call me a fucking bitch! Come on, Bobby, what the fuck? Yo, yo, Sophie! Sophie! You, yo, get the fuck out of here. Go! Get the fuck out of here! Go! She's crazy! Hey! Hey! Fuck, shit! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop. Stop. Don't run, stop right there. What's going on, guys? Get your hands out of your pocket. Get your hands out of your pocket. This guy giving you trouble? No, sir, he's my boyfriend. Man, we were just... Hey, listen, did I ask you a question? No, I didn't ask you anything. Girls, come on. Benny, you got him? Come on, let's go. I got him. Back up slowly. Over here, come on. Back up slowly for me, man. What's going on, then? Two guys we don't know were hassling us after the movie. My boyfriend scared them away. That what happened? Yeah. He was just protecting us. That's all he did. Moussa was just protecting us. Moussa? Mm-hm. Yeah. Let me see some IDs. We didn't do anything. Can I have your ID, please, ma'am? All three of you guys. What are you doing out here in the middle of the night? Your name is Moussa? Is it? Is your name Moussa? Yes. You're going to take your ID out slowly for me, Moussa. Put that right on here. Yeah, just down there? OK. It's not a very good idea to be running around here in the middle of the night like this. You come here often, running around here in the middle of the cold? No, we just went to the movies. It's pretty late, you know. Your parents know you're here? Yeah, yeah. They're expecting us any many. You don't know those guys who just ran away? No. Vance. Yeah? Can I talk to you for a second? Stay there, please. - You good? - Yeah. Guy was just taking care of his girl, but. All right. Let's give him a pass? Get out of this fucking cold? Yeah, all right. Go tell him. All right, y'all, head home. Go. No more fighting in the street. OK, thank you. Go! Thank you. You have a beautiful apartment. Thank you. My ex-husband got the cats. Those are lovely earrings. Thank you. My sekou bought them for me. Is that Moussa's father? His step-father. He's in Africa now, making money. You must miss him. We came here to be with him. He was here already, working, driving a limousine. So it's a little strange to be here without him. Is your family in New York? Mm-hmm. My parents live in the same apartment I grew up in, just a block away from here. I wish my mother could come here and live, be with her grandchildren. I can't stay here long. No, of course. I wanted to talk to you about what you said on the phone. Why don't you want Moussa to work with Isaac anymore? I just, um... Is that money? Because Isaac isn't... I have a cousin in Rhode Island. He says that these stories about the lawyer might not be true. That we could all be deported if he fails, and that we're better off waiting for these laws to change. But taht could be years. I'm sure it's scary, but Isaac is actually a very big corporate immigration lawyer. Well, my cousin says that... I'm sorry, who is your cousin? Look... Mubaka, - If we get deported... Moussa's smart. He's not broken the law in this country, and his old country is dangerous. He fits all the criteria to get asylum. Mubaka... Please, call me Jackie. Jackie. I didn't know anything about the laws before I came here. I didn't find them out, I didn't find out anything. I didn't know that my children would not be able to do all the things that other children can do here. And these are my babies and I failed them. No you didn't. Every night, when they're sleeping, I walk around the apartment like I'm lost. I don't know what I can do for them. I mean, I told Moussa and Armina that... I told them that I brought them to this country for medicine, for education, safety, for happiness. But it was really so that I could be with sekou. I am the worst mother. - No, you're not. - I was... No, no, no. Really so selfish. And now sekou is gone. He's not coming back. He married another woman and he left us here, stranded. He lied. So stupid. Every woman I know, at least one time in her life, trusted the wrong man. I made a habit out of it. Can I ask where Moussa's biological father is? He wasn't... I'm sorry. That's none of my business. He wasn't around for very long after Moussa was born. I told Moussa and Armina that... that he abandoned us, but that's not... That's not the truth. I just, I didn't want them to grow up and be frightened. And now it's... it's too late to tell them the truth. I was... I was behind the house hanging the washing and I heard this truck drive up. They were... Moussa and Armina, they were inside the house with my mother. I saw the military man take their father, put them in the truck, some other men. We never... We never heard from them again. Miriam, you need to tell that Moussa so that he can tell Isaac. - No, no, no. He would never forgive me. That will help him, that story. - No, he would hate me. - But that's... No. No. Well, OK. At least let him keep working with Isaac. If he keeps... If... Miriam? Moussa's so smart. Your son has a real chance here. Not just to survive, but to really have a lovely life. That kid can be anything. Even with everything that's messed up about the American dream, at least you can be better than your past. You have the chance to try here, and Moussa deserves that chance. He can never know about his father. That's your decision. But please, let him keep working with Isaac. You are the first American that Moussa has ever trusted. So I will trust you too - Hey! - Hey. Sophie, this is my sister Lola... Oh, hi! And her husband, Chris. Uh, this is... that's Mikey, and Javier, and Emilio, and Carlita. I'm Emilio, nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. This is Emily and... Hi, nice to meet you. I'm Alyssa. Nice to meet you. Hello. Hi, nice to meet you. Javier. You know her from where? School? - You go to school? - Yeah. So you do go to school. So, it was... Nice to meet you. Nice meeting you. OK. Have a nice day. Bye. You embarrassed? Hey. Hey. What the fuck is wrong with them? What the fuck is wrong with you? What was that, Friday night? Why'd you stick up for her like that? You embarrassed me. She's my friend. You sure that's all she is? Of course that's all she is. Are you kidding me? Look, she's just a little messed up. Hey! Babe, can you like, stop for two seconds? I gotta go. Baby, you... just stop. I want to thank you for what you said to the cops. Lying, you mean. Yes. Thank you. It meant a lot. Are you gonna even offer to try to make it up to me? Yes, babe. Yes, of course. I'm sorry. Can I take you to the movies again on Friday? That's not going to be enough! No, just us. Just us. We can even go to the Upper West Side, where ain't nobody gonna know us, OK? It'll just be me and the most beautiful girl in the world. OK. OK? You talked me into it. Moussa, Sarah, you two know better. We were just... Don' say anything. Then you don't have to lie. 'Til Friday? I think I can clear my schedule. You kidding me? No, I'm... Fuck. Bae, am I going to see you at lunch? I don't want to talk about it. Good, neither do I. Meet me out front after school. Why would I do that? Because I saved your as on Friday and you owe me. It's Sophie. What? She went ballistic the other night. When? This past Friday at the movies. Isaac said that she missed her appointment last week. Well, look, I'm going to take her with me today. She can have my slot. - No, you can't do that. No, no, it's fine. I already did all of my work. I just got to give it to Isaac. Sophie hasn't done shit. You need to look out for yourself. OK. What material have you found so far? Just the stuff that you know already. And does Isaac think that's enough? I don't know. I don't... You need to find him what he's asking for. There is no guarantee here. Have you asked your mom if she can remember anything? I know everything that she knows. Well, you should ask her again, just in case. You don't know. Maybe. But I'm still Sophie my slot today and that's that, ma'am. OK. Just please don't call me ma'am, OK, because it makes me feel like I'm 100. I mean, ay-yi-yi. Get to class. OK. Yo, what the fuck am I doing here? It's not even my day. Because I'm scared and I need the moral support. Did you have any luck with that additional material, Moussa? Oh, look who's alive. I thought you were meant to see me last Thursday. What happened? I got busy. Well, it's Moussa's appointment today, so... Good for me. No, I actually want her to stay. Whatever works. What do you got? No, read it to me. I want to hear it in your own voice. Well, this one is about my cousin. Two years ago, my cousin was walking to the market at sunrise, early to avoid being teased by the kids. Her body ripped when she had her baby, and so urine used to drip down her legs sometimes. It's called fistula. Then, when her baby was one, a year ago, two officials raped her. She reported it, and so did my grandmother, but the officials never got punished. And a few months later, she killed herself. OK. Well, I hope that's enough. As blunt as it may sound, it would have been better if it had actually been someone in your family who had been arrested or killed, but this is what we got, so we work with what we got. Double-check all those facts with your mother. We don't want any slip-ups. That could finish this case. So, um, I'm thinking, why don't we, why don't we, uh, why don't we, um, spend the rest of the time today catching up with what we missed with you, last week? Is that... is that OK with you? Perfect. OK. I don't have any stories like that. I don't even remember living in the DR, so I don't... Right. Right. Just thinking out loud, here. Your case is a little different. You're in this country under the age of 21, you have no legal guardian, you have no mother and father. I have a father. He loves me. Yeah, well. Love has nothing to do with it. Your fathers' not here. So. Could you just answer the questions when I asked them? This can be practice for when you're in front of the judge. I'm... prepping is my specialty. Is it? Hey, Moussa. Why don't you, um, go down the hall. You know those vending machines are? Mm-hmm. Just go ahead and get us a soda or something. You want a soda? I do. Get me, uh, get me whatever. Doesn't matter just... And something for yourself, too. All right. How old were you when you were sent to the Bronx? Seven. And when you came here, did you think it'd be a short visit or forever? Just a short visit, see my cousins. So your father didn't explain anything to you? Well, no. He was too drunk to take me to the airport, so my grandmother took me. I didn't even get to say goodbye to him. So you've been here for 10 years, and how many apartments have you lived in? Moved almost every year. Going from relative to relative. I wanted to stay with my grandfather in New Jersey, But. He died last year. Diabetes. Person I stayed with the longest was my uncle. What's that like? Favors all his own kids. Gives them money for everything, you know. McDonald's, sneakers, jeans, they get to watch the TV shows and everything. Orders me around like a slave. Actually, I kept hoping that I'd get picked up by immigration so I could get sent back to the DR, live with my father, but he's in jail again, so. Hm. So who takes care of you? Nobody takes care of me. I take care of everybody else. Who is everybody else? My uncle, my cousin, Carlita, her boyfriend, and their kids. And your cousin, Carlita? How does she treat you? She can't do nothing. About what? Just... me being ordered around and shit. What's Carlita's boyfriend like? Orders me around, like everybody else. Hey, I don't want to do this anymore, OK? Do you think the United States government has an obligation to help your father if you become a citizen here? I hadn't thought about that. Your father and his family have been in prison on and off almost their entire lives. Do you think being a criminal runs in the blood line? I don't know. Answer the question. I have no I-fucking-dea, man. Can you guarantee that you won't become a criminal? - I don't know. - Answer. - I don't know. - Answer. What kind of fucking question is that? - Answer. - I don't know. - Answer. - I don't know. - Answer. - I don't know. - Answer. - I don't know. - Answer the question. - I don't know. Will you become a criminal just like them? I don't have an answer for you. I don't have a fucking answer for you. Are you going to become a criminal just like them? I don't have a fucking answer for you! I don't have a fucking answer for you! I've seen judges be a lot worse than that. You got to keep your stuff together, Sophie. But that's not what I'm interested in talking about right now. What your family is doing to you is not right. It's called neglect. This is neglect. And I'm pretty sure it's something else, too. Isn't it? This can get you papers. I can get you papers. Will you let me do that for you? Sophie, look at me. Look at me. You're my responsibility now. You're my client. Nobody else. Let me get between you and them. I'll fucking bury them. Nobody's going to get past me. Now, you gotta stay out of trouble. This means some kid spits in your face at school, you got to walk away. All right? Understand? No fighting back. I do the fighting from now on. No! How y'all doing? This is a piece of trash, right here. No! Not me! You forgot to take this. She gotta get in the can. Here you go. Come on! No, no, but thank you! Have a good night, y'all. No, but like, what if I couldn't be there. You could. But what if I couldn't? Don't you trust me? I do, but that's not what I'm asking. What if I couldn't be there? Then you wouldn't be there. That's it? But you'll be there. Hey, mopey. What if I couldn't be there? Oh! What was that? Thank you. Mama, is this a joke? It's for the best. For the best? What are you talking about? He is the one who was actually meant to be here. It will be better for him. Better how? Don't... Moussa, don't raise your voice at me. Mama, how could you actually think about sending him back to Africa? Why? I don't want to discuss it. Whenever with him, Armina and I, we work all the time, you're at school, at least now he'll be with his grandmother all the time. Yeah, Mama, but in Guinea! He is an American citizen! He deserves to be here! I will send for him, I promise. As you say, he's an American. He has a passport. It will be easy for him to come to immigration. So when will you send for him? When you graduate college and you had a good job. Mama Mama, are you kidding me? That could be up to five years from now! He might not even remember us! Moussa, I have decided. That's it. And Amadou comes back, I don't want to discuss it. I don't want him to be scared. - Armina, are you hearing this? - Excuse me. Armina! What? You know what, you've always got such a big mouth. Why are you silent now? Leave me out of it. Leave you out... What is happ... Mama! OK, so when is he going, huh? My cousin said that you can get a cheap ticket if you book a few weeks in advance. In a few weeks, Mama? I'm going to do the laundry. I don't want to discuss it. Mama, come on, you can't do that! Excuse me, Moussa, excuse me! Move! Come on! What the fuck is going on here? Don't yell at me, Moussa. How can you just let her... What do you want me to say? That I want my little brother to be packed off? That I want him to forget me? Is that what you want me to say, Moussa? I want you to help me talk her out of it. She decided! And we can change her mind! Armina. It's because of you! What? It's all because of you! What... What are you talking about? Why are you being so mean to me? Don't you get it? We can't afford this country. Mama can't afford to keep all three of us here... - But that's... - So Amadou has to go back. Mina. Look at you. You think you're an American? Well, you're not, and they will never let you be. You may talk like them, and wear the right clothes, but you'll never be from this country. So where am I from? Guinea? A place that I can't hardly remember. No, you're just like me. From nowhere. Come in. Hey. Hi. Why don't you grab a seat? Uh-oh. What's going on? Jackie, I feel really awkward having to talk to you about this, but it's my job, so I got to bring it up. A couple of people have come to me with, I don't know, I don't want to say accusation, um, concern about the amount of time that you have been spending alone with Moussa. People have noticed it. I've noticed it. And I'm not suggesting that anything inappropriate has happened, but, um, it's got to stop. Zoe... Because if one more person comes to me with it, - I'm going to... - Zoe! Have to treat it as an actual complaint. Look, I know, you believe in this kid. You want to see him succeed, but I am telling you... Oh my God... as your friend... He's undocumented! Oh. Wow, of course. OK. Wow. I'm sorry. I just... I panicked. I never had to have this conversation with anybody before. Oh, God, I feel sick. Wow. OK. I'm sorry I didn't tell you. Who else? You know what? Don't tell me. Zoe, I'll tell you if you want to know. Mm. Wow. You know, I canceled all of the senior field trips last year. I blamed it on lack of funds, but it was actually me. I read about this kid who got deported because he had to show a fake ID to get on a bus for a school field trip to Washington. I didn't want that to happen to any of our kids here. So I squashed the whole thing. You got some shit from parents. They got over it. Yeah. Jackie, no more private chats. Got it. Thank you. Miss! Hi, what's up? Did you know? What? Did you... did my mother tell you? What are you talking about? Why aren't you in class? - Did you know? - What? Shh. Wait. I knkow that my mom came to see you on Friday. Did you know? Did she tell you then? You knew. How could you not tell me? - No, we can't. I can't talk to you about this right now. Come here, please. Listen, we can't talk about these things at school anymore. Why didn't you tell me? I'm so sorry, I... You know when you saw me yesterday! I couldn't tell you, I'm so... Please calm down. How could you know and not tell me? Listen, what happened to your father was horrible, but it is up to your mother whether or not she wants to tell you. She was just trying to protect you. What are you talking about? What do you mean? My mother's sending Amadou back to Guinea. What're you talking about? Miss? Did something happen to my father? I'm so sorry. I got it wrong. I was thinking of the wrong thing. I was thinking of the wrong person. - I'm so sorry. - No. I'm so sorry. No, don't do this. Miss, miss. You don't... You know what? You need to let go of my arm. Miss. Miss, did something happen to my father? Let go of my arm! I'm so sorry. Aftermath. There she go, shaking that ass on the floor. Bumping and grinding that pole. The way she's grinding that pole, I think I'm losing control. Get buzzed, get drunk, get crunk... Here's your punch, girl. Thank you. Welcome. Come on, let's go dance, let's go have fun. Come on, though! You look miserable. It's prom night. - Seriously! - I'm fine. Fine. Let's go. - We're going. - Going where? We have other plans. I can't tell you. But we're going. Maybe alcohol will help you out. - Ugh. - There you go. Let's go. Sorry! Where are we going? Somewhere where you're allowed to smile. No, not if we do it. If we get caught. Seriously? Things have changed since day one. Hi! OK. Happy prom, girls. Happy prom, finally! Thank you, is that water? Come get this cup, come on. - Water. - Thanks. Definitely. Come on. Oh, sorry, we have to cheers first. My bad. To us? To us! Fine bitches! Where is that boy? This is my last time in a fancy civilian dress and he's missing it. Ooh, your first break in training, I'm coming down to Atlanta, and we're going shopping. - OK, OK, though. - For real? What? You going to make this poor girl go shopping for a whole bunch of clothes that you know damn well she can't wear for the rest of the year. I wasn't saying that! I was just saying she can come shopping with me while I buy clothes. Because that makes it so much better! OK, you have no idea what we're talking about, OK? We have a different kind of friendship that you and her do. Ooh, relax girls. There's enough of Sarah to go around for everybody. What the hell is that supposed to mean? She was just saying it's prom. You know, and we're not going to see each other for a while, so we might as well have fun tonight, right? Is that what you meant? Yeah. I'm about to sound so crazy, but Sophie is right. I'm gonna miss my girls. Come on!- Me too. I'm gonna miss you guys! Aw! We're going to be college living, guys? Seriously! Have you thought about that for like at least a second? It's over! Oh, I can't wait. True. I'm so excited. Tina, what are you going to study, by the way? Maybe singing. Ooh, maybe psychology. Yeah, Tina, girl. Be one of them singing psychologists! OK, OK. I thought about going to college, but then I realized in the army I can study what I want for free, and then have a job at the end of it. Make some money. Where is he? Maybe he's getting us weed. I just want him to be here. I love that little baby so much. Is this all right? It's OK. I'm surprised you know how. Come on, I want everyone in the picture. Come on. Get in. Come on. OK, get in, get in, get in. - Fix my hair! - Wait, wait, wait. Oh, OK. Are we done? I'm so short! OK, ready? One, two, three. Say prom! - Prom! - Perfect. Oh. OK. OK. Too many selfies. Wait, fuck. Where's my phone? Filter that and send it to me. What? You lost it? Oh, no. Bobby has my phone. Whatever. Why does Bobby have your phone? Huh? You know what I mean. You're gonna tell me about Bobby later. Oh, look who I found! Speaking of the devil! Baby! Thank you! Ooh, you smell like you broke the bottle. Bobby had something. Uh-huh. Oh. I got to drinking. You can't hold your liquor. He doesn't look good. No, he's been like that all night. We are gonna be the hottest couple on the base when you sign up. If you ever sign up. Don't start that shit no more. Baby, come on! Hey. Give him a break. And who the fuck are you? I'm someone who maybe knows more about the situation than you. I know who you are, bitch. You're a criminal slut. Say that again. No. Talk to me. Guys, we're supposed to be having fun right... Shut the fuck up, Alyssa. Come on. Show us all how crazy you are. You up for it? Because I am. - Tonight, if you want to go. - Sophie. I'm for real, let's go. Come on. Where's the tough girl gone now? Oh, you good when you got the jump on someone, right? Just not when someone's ready and waiting? Oh shit. Oh shit. Never did I ever. I'll drink to that. Oh, shit. Nah, nah, nah, nah. I'll drink to that. You see that shit? You did the right thing, OK? What the fuck is so funny? I said, what the fuck is so funny, huh? What are you doing? Oh my God! - Moussa! - Oh my God! Moussa, what the fuck are you doing? Mike, get him off! Yo, Moussa! What the fuck are you doing? Moussa, Moussa, Moussa! Moussa! Fuck you! Fuck you, man! Fuck you! Man, let's go. Oh my God. Moussa, what happened? Moussa. We're here for you. Just talk to us. Just leave me the fuck alone. Moussa. We need to get this shit cleaned up, all right? Sophie, let's go! What are you doing? Go Back to sleep. I said, what are you doing? Go back to sleep. What's with the suitcase? Why are you not at prom? I am. I'm going there now. Don't lie. What's with the suitcase? Amadou cannot go back there. What are you talking about? Mama is sending him back because of me. You said so yourself. I was angry, I didn't mean it. He can't go back there. It... things happen there. It's not safe. I won't let Mama send him back. College is not worth it. I'm not worth it. Don't say that, Moussa, please. Don't go. I'm so sorry. Let go, Armina. Let go. Where will you go? I will get a job and I will wait it out until the laws change. Please be safe. Wait, what... what do I tell Mama? Tell her I love her. I think that Moussa is a very resourceful young man, and I think he'll do what he needs to do. Last week I got some cash in the mail. Has to be from Moussa, right? For rent? Which means that... I wouldn't even know if my son is alive or... I have to, have to think about Armina. Now I have to think about getting papers for her. Yeah. I think that's... That's a good idea. And for yourself, too. I can never move or he won't know where to come home to. Let us know if you hear from Moussa. Yes. Miriam, um. You should call me next week. We'll get that started for you and your daughter. Thank you, Mr. Miller. Isaac. Isaac. Thank you. I fucked up. Ah, she's upset. Her son is missing, and she can't even go to the police. She can't talk to anyone. She has no way of processing what's happening to her. How could I think I had anything to teach these kids about reality? They could teach me about reality. Sometimes I think he would have been better off never filing, just waiting for the landscape to change. You know, I called up an old college buddy of mine last week. He works in a little firm up in the Bronx. Deals with a lot of asylum-seekers. I went up there to ask him some stuff, to make sure I wasn't missing anything. Man. You want to see what it looks like, waiting for the landscape to change? Go up there during the week. Visit his office. So many people squeezed in there, waiting day after day, hour after hour, no magazines, no windows. Not one person has any idea if they'll be able to stay in this country. He said, he doesn't even set appointments anymore. How does he stand it? He drinks. What about Sophie? Well, you know. I... legally I have to talk to my client first, but, um, well, let's just say it wouldn't be a waste of time if Sophie started thinking about which college she wants to apply to. And Alyssa? Oh, shit. Does she know? Nope, not yet. You know, she's giving the valedictorian speech tomorrow. I know, I know. I want her to have that moment first. - I - wasn't born with strength. It came into me. It was breathed into me from places in a country I will probably never see again. Far from the Bronx. Today, I see all of the faces I've come to know and love in this auditorium. Not the blow-up faces we're told should inspire us, but the real faces of the real people who lead by example. Today, we celebrate our moment with you. You've seen our students every day with no breakfast, no sleep, and you would whisper something nice in our ear when we looked sad or defeated. Today, I hear each and every one of your voices. The sound of your voice is so loud. You have never left us. And we will always be by you. We're all in this together. My thighs are killing me! Wait, Jackie has to get in it! - Jackie has to get in it! - Jackie! Come on! Jackie! Jackie! My hat kept falling off, I was like, so like, self-conscious of it? Because I'm a midget! Cheese! What, where's my thing? Let's do another one! Ready? You guys, Sophie's calling. Catch it, catch it, catch it! Alyssa, I don't want to... Jackie! Yeah! I can't... Hi, very nice to meet you. These thighs are burning. I'll come say hi to Alyssa's parents. Five, six, seven, eight, now!
