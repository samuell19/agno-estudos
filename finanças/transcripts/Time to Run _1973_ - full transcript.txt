"BUT STILL WITHIN THE LITTLE CHILDREN'S EYES "SEEMS SOMETHING, SOMETHING THAT REPLIES, "THEY AT LEAST ARE FOR ME, SURELY FOR ME." IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'VE ALREADY READ IT. SO? SO GIVE IT TO ME IN ONE SENTENCE. [sighs] IT'S ABOUT HOW FRANCIS THOMPSON TRIED TO RUN AWAY FROM GOD ALL HIS LIFE... UH-HUH. BUT HE COULDN'T. AND THAT'S WHY HE CALLED HIM THE HOUND OF HEAVEN. "I FLED HIM DOWN THE NIGHTS AND DOWN THE DAYS "I FLED HIM DOWN THE ARCHES OF THE YEARS; "I FLED HIM DOWN THE LABYRINTHINE WAYS "OF MY OWN MIND; "AND IN THE MIDST OF TEARS..."

I HAD AN IDEA SOMETHING LIKE THIS MIGHT HAPPEN SO... [laughter] (reporter) ...ON CAMPUS THIS AFTERNOON, AND I'VE ASKED SOME OF THE STUDENTS WHAT THEY FELT ABOUT FAEMAD. WELL, LET'S FIND OUT, LET'S TALK TO SOME MORE OF THEM. (Warren Cole) THAT COMPLEX THAT WE'VE BEEN BUILDING OUT THERE, IS NOT A, A PILOT PLANT FOR POWER DISTRIBUTION. YOU'VE BEEN LISTENING, WHAT ABOUT YOU? OH, MAN, THAT'S NOT MY BAG, I'M NOT INTERESTED. (Jeff Cole) I THINK IT'S THE GREATEST THING TO HIT THIS TOWN SINCE THE ELECTRIC TOOTHPICK. [chuckling] OH, THAT'S A CURIOUS ANALOGY. UH, WOULD YOU CARE TO EXPLAIN THAT? NOT REALLY. WE ACHIEVE MORE IN SATISFACTION OF OUR NEEDS WITH FEWER MAN HOURS OF LABOR BECAUSE OF POWER AND ENERGY THAN ANY OTHER COUNTRY IN THE WORLD. WELL, WAIT, YOU OBVIOUSLY HAVE A STRONG OPINION. NAH, UH-HUH. BUT I HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS. [Jeff on TV] DOES ANYBODY HAPPEN TO KNOW WHAT WOULD GO WRONG IF SOME LITTLE THING HAPPENED TO OUR COMMUNITY ATOMIC REACTOR? YOU KNOW, AND JUST HOW MANY JOBS UH, WILL AUTOMATION TAKE AWAY FROM THE PEOPLE THAT JUST DON'T HAPPEN TO HAVE AN ENGINEERING DEGREE? AND WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO WITH THE HOT WASTE? HOW MUCH MORE OF OUR SHORELINE WILL HAVE TO BE CORDONED OFF FROM PUBLIC USE WHENEVER THE POWER DEMAND IS LOW, AND THE HEAT GENERATED GETS RE-ROUTED BACK INTO THE SEA? AND WE BELIEVE THAT THIS MASSIVE INSTALLATION OF OURS IS TRULY A LIVING SYMBOL OF WHAT MAN CAN ACCOMPLISH WHEN HIS HEART AND HIS MIND ARE HARNESSED TO THE SERVICE OF HUMANITY. AND ISN'T IT TRUE THAT FAEMAD'S VERY BIGGEST CUSTOMER ISN'T GOING TO BE... [phone rings] ...THE LITTLE HOUSEWIFE WITH HER WASHING MACHINE.

WE'RE SINGING ABOUT LOVE. BUT WHAT IS THIS LOVE, THIS LOVE WE SING ABOUT? LOVE IS A PRETTY GENERAL TERM TODAY. IT, IT COULD MEAN ANYTHING FROM SOMETHING SOMEONE MIGHT SAY TO SOMEONE WHEN THEY WANTED TO GO TO BED WITH THEM, TO A, AN ECSTATIC, SPIRITUAL FEELING OF FULFILLMENT, DEEP INSIDE. I DON'T THINK HE'S HERE, FRAN. BUT REAL LOVE, AS TAUGHT BY THE BIBLE, IS GIVING. THE BIBLE SAYS IN LUKE 10 WHEN A LEGAL EXPERT ASKED JESUS ABOUT GOD'S COMMAND TO LOVE THY NEIGHBOR, JESUS REPLIED WITH THIS STORY. IT SEEMS THERE WAS THIS MAN TRAVELING FROM JERICHO TO JERUSALEM, THAT COULD HAVE BEEN FROM LOS ANGELES TO SAN FRANCISCO FOR THAT MATTER, AND HE FELL AMONG SOME THIEVES AND THEY BEAT HIM UP, TOOK HIS MONEY, TOOK HIS CLOTHES, AND PUSHED HIM OFF TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND JUST GENERALLY RIPPED HIM OFF. THIS PRIEST CAME ALONG. HE WAS A VERY HOLY INDIVIDUAL. HE LOOKED AT THE MAN LAYING AT THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND DECIDED THAT HE DIDN'T WANT TO GET INVOLVED, SO HE PASSED HIM BY. THEN AN ASSISTANT OR SOMEBODY FROM THE TEMPLE CAME ALONG AND HE LOOKED AT THE GUY LAYING THERE AND RUSHED RIGHT BY BECAUSE HE DIDN'T HAVE THE TIME TO BE INVOLVED. THAT SEEMS TO ME TO BE WHERE MOST OF US ARE. THAT SEEMS TO BE THE HUMAN CONDITION. WE, WE NEED THIS HELP, AND WE REACH OUT FOR THIS HELP, BUT NOBODY HEARS US BECAUSE EVERYBODY'S JUST TOO BUSY. BUT THAT'S NOT THE END OF THE STORY. ANOTHER MAN CAME DOWN THE ROAD. HE WAS WHAT THE BIBLE CALLED A "DESPISED SAMARITAN." WE WOULD PROBABLY CALL HIM THE LAST MAN ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH TO HELP ANYBODY, BECAUSE NOBODY EVER HELPED HIM. THE SAMARITANS HAD THEIR OWN LITTLE GHETTO, YOU KNOW. HE KNEW ALL ABOUT PAIN, SO HE WALKED OVER TO THE MAN AT THE SIDE OF THE ROAD, AND BANDAGED HIM UP, AND TOOK CARE OF HIM. MAYBE YOU'VE BEp WAYLAID BY THE SIDE OF LIFE'S HIGHWAY OR MAYBE YOU KNOW SOMEONE WHO HAS. JESUS LOVES YOU, YOU KNOW. HE WANTS TO HELP YOU.

(Billy Graham) ...IF HE GAIN THE WHOLE WORLD AND LOSE HIS OWN SOUL. SIMON AND GARFUNKEL WROTE THIS: "IMPALED UPON MY WALL, MY EYES DIMLY SEE, "THE PATTERN OF MY LIFE AND THE PUZZLE THAT IS ME. "FROM THE MOMENT OF MY BIRTH TO THE INSTANT OF MY DEATH, "THERE ARE PATTERNS I MUST FOLLOW "JUST AS I MUST BREATHE EACH BREATH. "LIKE A RAT IN A MAZE, THE PATH BEFORE ME LIES, "AND THE PATTERN NEVER ALTERS, UNTIL THE RAT DIES." IS THAT THE WAY YOUR LIFE SEEMS? JUST A CIRCLE? JUST A MAZE? NO PURPOSE AND NO MEANING, LIFE MAKES NO SENSE? DID YOU KNOW THAT YOU CAN REALLY LIVE ANY WAY THAT YOU WANT TO LIVE AND THERE'S NOTHING THAT GOD CAN DO ABOUT IT? YOU'RE NOT A PUPPET ON A STRING. YOU'RE NOT A MECHANICAL TOY THAT GOD WINDS UP AND TURNS YOU LOOSE AND YOU DO WHAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO. YOU'RE MADE IN THE IMAGE OF GOD. YOU'RE MADE IN THE MORAL IMAGE OF GOD. YOU CAN CHOOSE! YOU CAN CHOOSE THE KIND OF LIFE YOU'RE GOING TO LEAD. IF YOU WANT TO LEAD A LIFE TOTALLY AWAY FROM GOD, PLEASING YOUR OWN FLESH, YOUR OWN DESIRES, UNDER THE CONTROL OF YOUR OWN WILL WITHOUT ANY RESTRAINTS, WITHOUT ANY LORDSHIP OF JESUS CHRIST, GO AHEAD AND DO IT! NO, YOU CANNOT ESCAPE JESUS. YOU CAN TRY, BUT YOU CAN'T DO IT. IF JESUS CLAIMED TO BE GOD KNOWING THAT HE WAS NOT, THEN, OF COURSE, HE'S A LIAR. IF JESUS THOUGHT HE WAS GOD AND DIDN'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE, HE WAS A MANIAC. BUT IF JESUS CHRIST IS WHO HE CLAIMS TO BE-- GOD IN THE FLESH-- THEN NOTHING ELSE COUNTS EXCEPT TO KNOW HIM. WITH ALL OF OUR SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL ACHIEVEMENT, WITH ALL OF OUR INTELLECTUALISM, WE CANNOT ESCAPE JESUS. EVERYBODY HAS TO DECIDE ABOUT JESUS! WHO IS HE? WHAT WAS HE? WHAT DEMANDS DOES HE HAVE ON MY LIFE TODAY? GOD SAID, "I'LL BECOME A MAN!" AND YOUNG PEOPLE, I WANT TO TELL YOU, THAT'S WHO JESUS CHRIST IS. [applause] GOD BECAME A MAN! AND GOD, IN THE FORM OF JESUS CHRIST, BORN OF A VIRGIN, WALKED AMONG US, AND HE SHOWED US WHAT GOD IS LIKE, AND IF I WANT TO KNOW WHAT GOD IS LIKE, I TAKE A LONG LOOK AT JESUS. I WATCH HIM AS HE MAKES THE BLIND MAN TO SEE AND THE DUMB MAN TO TALK AND THE DEAD MAN TO RISE. BUT THAT WASN'T WHY HE CAME. HE DIDN'T COME JUST TO LIVE AMONG US; HE DIDN'T COME JUST TO TEACH US A NEW WAY OF LIFE. JESUS CHRIST CAME FOR ANOTHER PURPOSE-- HE CAME TO DIE ON THE CROSS. YOU SEE, THE CROSS OF CHRIST WHERE HE DIED FOR OUR SINS, THAT WAS A JUDGMENT. JESUS SAID, "TO THIS END WAS I BORN." HE WAS NOT ACCIDENTALLY PUT TO DEATH. AND HE SAID, "MY GOD! WHY HAST THOU FORSAKEN ME?" AT THAT MOMENT, IN SOME MYSTERIOUS WAY, GOD WAS JUDGING HIS SON INSTEAD OF US. HE DIDN'T JUST GIVE HIM TO DIE. HE GAVE HIM TO SIN! HE BECAME SIN FOR US! THE BIBLE SAYS, "ALL HAVE SINNED." WHAT DOES "SIN MEAN? SIN MEANS THAT YOU'VE BROKEN THE LAW OF GOD. SIN MEANS THAT YOU'VE COME SHORT OF GOD'S [Billy Graham on television) HOLY REQUIREMENTS FOR ETERNAL LIFE. ALL OF US ARE SINNERS. ALL OF US HAVE MISSED THE MARK. (Warren) HONEY, I WAS JUST GOING THROUGH MY BAG. I CAN'T FIND MY NINE IRON OR MY PUTTER. I THINK THEY MIGHT BE IN JEFF'S ROOM. HE USED THEM LAST SUMMER. [Billy Graham from television] THAT'S WHY HE CAME AND DIED ON THE CROSS, TO CONQUER SIN, TO TAKE AWAY THIS COSMIC LONELINESS THAT WE ALL FEEL. YOU KNOW, THE GOD OF THE BIBLE IS NOT SOME COLD, IMPERSONAL FORMULA OR SOME POWER... YOU WANT SOME COFFEE? YEAH, UH-HMM. AND JESUS SAID, "I'VE COME TO BRING LIFE, "AND LIFE ABUNDANTLY!" JESUS SAID YOU CANNOT SERVE GOD AND MAMMON. HE SAID, "A MAN'S LIFE CONSISTETH NOT IN THE ABUNDANCE "OF THE THINGS THAT HE POSSESSES." RICHES MAKE PEOPLE SOLITARY, LONELY AND OFTEN AFRAID. IF YOU MAKE MONEY YOUR GOD, IT LEAVES YOU EMPTY. GEORGE BERNARD SHAW SAID, "THERE ARE TWO TRAGEDIES IN LIFE. "ONE IS NOT TO GET YOUR HEART'S DESIRE. "AND THE OTHER IS TO GET IT." YOU THINK IF YOU HAD A LOT OF MONEY YOU'D BE HAPPY. SOME OF YOU'VE ALREADY GOT A LOT, AND YOU'RE NOT HAPPY. TWO TRAGEDIES... YOU DIDN'T GET IT, AND YOU DID GET IT. YOU SEE, WITHOUT GOD, LIFE LOSES ITS ZEST, AND ITS PURPOSE AND ITS MEANING. YOU WERE MADE FOR GOD, AND WITHOUT GOD, YOU CAN NEVER FIND TOTAL FULFILLMENT... OH, THANKS. ...AND TOTAL SATISFACTION. HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE WATCHING ME THAT ARE HAVING PROBLEMS IN YOUR HOME? HE CAN GIVE YOU A NEW HOME. TURN IT OVER TO HIM, TAKE ALL THE SELFISHNESS OUT AND PUT CHRIST FIRST, AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS. WHAT IS THE CURE? THERE IS A CHRISTIAN CURE. THE CURE IS CHRIST, TO GO TO OUR KNEES. IF YOU WAIT UNTIL YOU CAN UNDERSTAND IT ALL, OR ACCEPT IT ALL SCIENTIFICALLY, YOU'LL NEVER COME! JESUS SAID, "EXCEPT YOU BECOME AS A LITTLE CHILD "AND BE CONVERTED, "YOU CANNOT ENTER THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN." WHAT DOES CONVERTED MEAN? CONVERTED JUST MEANS CHANGE. YOU'RE GOING IN ONE DIRECTION IN YOUR LIFE, AND YOU CHANGE AND START A NEW DIRECTION AND YOUR NEW DIRECTION IS TOWARD GOD, WITH CHRIST IN YOUR HEART, THAT'S CONVERSION. CONVERSION IS THE WORK OF GOD. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS BE WILLING AND HE'LL DO IT. I'M GOING TO ASK YOU TO SUBMIT AND SURRENDER YOUR LIFE AND YOUR HEART TO HIM AND START LIFE ALL OVER AGAIN. WITH HIS LOVE AND HIS POWER TO HELP YOU. WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO DO? YOU HAVE TO BE WILLING TO GIVE UP YOUR SIN AND CONFESS THAT YOU'VE FAILED AND SINNED AGAINST GOD. I'M GOING TO ASK YOU BY FAITH TO COME TO HIS CROSS WHERE HE SHED HIS BLOOD FOR YOU, AND LET HIM WASH YOU CLEAN OF YOUR PAST AND CHANGE YOUR LIFE AND MAKE YOU A NEW PERSON. I'M ASKING YOU TO GET UP OUT OF YOUR SEAT AND COME AND STAND RIGHT HERE IN FRONT OF THIS PLATFORM, AND SAY, "I WANT CHRIST. "I CHOOSE CHRIST AS MY LORD "AND MY MASTER AND MY SAVIOR." THERE'S A YOUNG MAN, THERE'S A YOUNG WOMAN, THERE'S A FATHER, THERE'S A MOTHER HERE TONIGHT THAT CHRIST IS SPEAKING TO. AND YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FACE DEATH AND YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FACE THE JUDGMENT, AND YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FACE LIFE. AND YOU CAN'T FACE ANY OF THEM REALLY, WITHOUT CHRIST.

AND I REALIZED HOW WEAK I REALLY WAS, HOW I NEEDED SOMEBODY WHO'S STRONG AND WHOSE LOVE WAS CONSTANT. I HAD SOME FRIENDS WHO TOLD ME ABOUT JESUS CHRIST, AND I REALLY KNEW THAT I NEEDED HIM, AND THAT HE REALLY WANTED ME. I JUST COULDN'T HELP BUT RESPOND TO HIS UNENDING LOVE. I FELT LIKE I WAS LOST, YOU KNOW, LIKE, 25 YEARS. LIKE I USED HEROIN FOR SEVEN YEARS, LIKE I'VE BEEN IN THE PENITENTIARY. LIKE I FELT LIKE I NEVER BELONGED ALL MY LIFE. LIKE I FELT LIKE SOMETHING WAS ALWAYS MISSING INSIDE OF ME. AND NOW LIKE, I FEEL WHOLE, I FEEL COMPLETE. AND IT'S THROUGH JESUS CHRIST. IN COMING OUT OF THE DRUG CULTURE, I FOUND ONE OF THE BIGGEST HANG UPS FOR ME WAS THAT I WAS NEVER WILLING TO ADMIT THAT I WAS WRONG, OR THAT I COULD POSSIBLY BE SINFUL OR SOMETHING. AND I FOUND THAT WHEN I ACCEPTED CHRIST, AT THE AGE OF 18, ALL I HAD TO DO WAS JUST BE MYSELF. AND THAT'S THE KIND OF RELATIONSHIP I FOUND THAT GOD WANTED WITH ME. YOU KNOW, I USED TO REALLY RESENT CHRISTIANS WITH THEIR SMILEY FACES AND THEIR WHITE BIBLES. AND THEY'D COME UP TO ME, AND THEY'D TELL ME WHAT A WONDERFUL, PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP THEY HAD WITH JESUS CHRIST. UNTIL ONE DAY, I WAS IN A, UH, A VOLKSWAGEN REPAIR SHOP. AND, UH, AND THIS GUY CAME UP TO ME AND SAT DOWN NEXT TO ME WITH A BIBLE. AND SO I THOUGHT AS A GAME I'D ASK HIM SOME OF THE USUAL QUESTIONS ABOUT GOD AND JESUS CHRIST AND THINGS, AND RIGHT THERE, HE EXPLAINED TO ME WHY I NEEDED JESUS CHRIST AS MY PERSONAL SAVIOR. AND, YOU KNOW, DRIVING HOME RIGHT AFTER THAT, IN MY, IN MY REPAIRED VOLKSWAGEN, I COULD TELL THAT I WAS, I WAS A NEW PERSON, AND JESUS WAS REALLY IN MY LIFE. I REMEMBER GOING TO CHURCH EVERY SUNDAY OF MY LIFE, AND I'D COME AWAY FROM MY DEAL ON SUNDAY AND THINK I'D DONE MY BIT FOR THE WEEK. BUT I WAS MISSING THE WHOLE POINT OF WHAT CHURCH IS ABOUT. BUT THEN ONE DAY, A GUY ON A FOOTBALL FIELD REALLY TOLD ME THAT CHRISTIANITY IS A PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP WITH CHRIST, AND THAT GOD, MY GOD, WANTED TO BE A 7-DAY-A-WEEK GOD, NOT JUST A SUNDAY GOD. AND I FOUND WHEN I INVITED JESUS INTO MY LIFE THAT I HAD A GOD THAT WAS WITH ME ALL THE TIME. THERE WAS A GIRL IN MY CLASS WHO, UH, STARTED TALKING TO ME ABOUT CHRIST, AND I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT BECAUSE SHE REALLY SEEMED TO BE, UH, A SEMI-, UH, INTELLECTUAL PERSON, AND I COULDN'T BRING THE TWO TOGETHER. AND ONE BY ONE, ALL MY INTELLECTUAL ARGUMENTS STARTED BREAKING DOWN, AND UH, CHRIST IS IN MY LIFE. AND YOU KNOW, UH, IT'S NOT HARD TO BE ALONE NOW. IT'S NOT HARD TO, BE ALONE AT NIGHT. BECAUSE I KNOW THAT GOD IS REALLY THERE. AFTER AWHILE, I JUST, UM, STOPPED RUNNING, I GUESS. WELL, I GUESS THE CHASE IS OVER. I'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF SEARCHING. BUT I'VE DECIDED TO TRUST JESUS. I, I NEED... FOR HIM TO GIVE ME... WELL, FOR ONE THING, LOVE. I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN FROM HERE ON, BUT I DO KNOW THAT I NEED JESUS.
