--== McEphie ==-- Never mind. That's thick. We ate everything. Do we have almusal? -What? B-R-E-A-K-F-A-S-T? -Almusal! We got no almusal! No, don't bother. You know she loves surprises. My buddies practiced on me. It's nothing. Is this you? Send her my regards. Weirdo! I forgot my keys. Get the door for me, please. How's Fiona's grandma, Ford? Still breathing. She's been on her deathbed for a month now. Yes, she has. Do you have other students? Surfing season is almost over. I hope you're saving some money, Ford. What are you saying? You mean I should charge her? -That's weird. -Why? What's she paying for? This? Why not? You're gross. Are you close to her? Nineteen. Jess is a good person. She'll go straight to heaven. I don't know if I believe in an afterlife. Of course, because you're only 19. Ford, I don't recall you telling me that Fiona is 19. Just tell her about Gaspar. When Ford was a kid, he became obsessed with the sun. I did everything I could, but he kept staring at the sun. One day he ran out of the house. I chased him, but I couldn't catch up. Until the entire town chased after him. Then he stumbled. And was burning up with fever. He didn't speak for two days. That's when I called for a shaman. The shaman arrived, chewing ginger. He put the ginger on Ford's forehead. That shaman had breath! Then he melted candle wax on water, and the wax form would reveal the element that cursed Ford. It was Gaspar. That's when I panicked. Then the shaman whispered something to Ford. Afterward, Ford spoke again. That's a secret. She doesn't know. Don't tell her. She can't know! He hasn't told anybody ever. Just you. You should be. I did tell one other person, but we don't talk anymore. Do you have some money? Fiona will pay for almusal. You'll let her do that? If she wants to buy us breakfast, why stop her? She stood up too soon. I like her. Me too. Are you guys serious? Yes, we're getting married. Keep joking! But who among your girls have you brought home three times? Is "Bayag" the one who's going to beat you in the competition? He doesn't want to be called "Ballsack" anymore. -He wants to go by "Andres" now. -Ballsack is a braggart. You're allowed to brag when you're good. On your feet! You want almusal? Jordan is waiting for us. Jordan? He's always late. He's never late for a free meal. Hey, Fiona, aren't we getting almusal? Almusal! -Did you hear? -Thanks, Fiona. Rich doubled the prize money in the competition to 100,000 pesos! Our new congressman is making himself popular. In his first week, he's had the bridge fixed. Your best friend sure works fast. -We grew up together. -Like lovers! They weren't just friends. They were very close. Ford was the late governor's favorite. This one has a sharp tongue. We can play. Ford isn't the type who thinks about the future. The future doesn't exist. There's only now. Here comes the future. Hey, Ballsack! Fuck you too. Because earlier, they were just carts. Rolling carts. Then they became permanent, so now they're "rolling stores." -So, is that what turns you on? Old men? -Rich! Congressman! I missed you! So handsome! -How have you been? -I'm good. Bro. My condolences. My condolences to you too. Okay. Sorry about your dad… But did you get me anything from the States? -Aren't you getting married? -That's why I'm home. I brought your check for the competition. -That's 100,000 pesos. You should join! -Let's see. -Where are you going now? -Dad's office. -We'll come with you? -Sure. Let's go. There's someone I want you to meet. Is it a girl? And my girlfriend, Fiona. Whatever you heard, it's all true. -You mean his crooked penis? -It's not crooked! I can bend it with my mind. There's a difference. Because of a crooked dick? That's it? Woman, your standards are low. -Who was that? -Beats me. Fiona, has Ford taken you to the museum? -No. -Not yet? Tell him to take you there one of these days… This drink is strong. Let me put it back. About my father. You know, those artifacts are so difficult to clean. Especially now that we're understaffed. Hey, sorry! Sorry about earlier. I don't know what's going on with Ford. Be understanding with him. Don't worry about it, Auntie. It's how it is. But you're practically brothers. That's Ford. He's really good. In fact, he's the best. Rich was also good, but he can't surf anymore. I wasn't that good. Auntie Chona's just being nice. I had surgery. This is the exhibit about that movie that was shot here. This was me. How young were you then? I gave birth to Ford nine months after that. Go ahead, ask me. Don't be shy. Don't you want to know who Ford's father is? Are you okay? I'm okay. Honey. I'll go ahead. What happened? Rice cake, miss? Which way is the beach? I'll tell if you buy. Would you like some? This one is good. Mom told you about my father? Do you believe her? Nope. A crew member, maybe. It doesn't matter. My mom wasn't the only one who got pregnant. Why don't you believe her story? Just believe her. I got pregnant when I was 14 too. What was his name? She is weird. -Delicious! -Right? Don't you remember? Every time I brought Ford here, I always had rice cakes for you. Of course I remember. How could I forget? Each time you brought us food, Mom would get angry for some reason. I don't know why. Do you? She really hated me. She had no reason to get jealous. You know nothing happened between me and your father, right? I know. But my mom was right to be jealous of you because I liked you more than her. She's good. Of course she's good. She has a great teacher. Rich told me to take lessons from you if I want to learn. Sure. I won't charge you for the lessons. Consider it my wedding gift. He also said you will try to have sex with me. I won't charge for that too. I'm joking! What time? Tomorrow at dawn, before the sun rises. Good job! Very, very good! I'm off. -Motherfucker. -Oh shit! You should go in. It's okay. Why pick a fight with Rich? The kid is still grieving. You're drunk. You're an asshole. You're a whore. Isn't it nice that we're so close in age? We're more like buddies. Just wonderful. It's a great feeling to not have a parent around. The wonderful life of an orphan. I wish I gave you up for adoption. By the way, Rich said he can now get in touch with your father. Now that he's a congressman, for sure, the director's lawyers will listen to him, right? Wait, what? Why? Why? They've made contact. He'll send a letter soon. Just take it back. I don't want to. -God damn it! -Fuck! -You don't know anything, you bitch! -Are you a moron? What the hell? -What? -Asshole, that was my last beer. Motherfucker. Knock it off, Ma. You're drunk. Did I scare Fiona? Maybe. She went straight in. I thought she was going to walk out. Anybody home? Let's go. -Shouldn't we be in the water? -We don't need water to surf. Close your eyes. Use your imagination. Paddle, paddle, paddle just a little. The front should be 45 degrees. Then your knees should always be like this. Pretend your crush is watching you surf. Think about your crush, not Rich. Rich! Come in. Ford isn't here, remember? He's teaching Serena how to surf. Yes, I know. What are your plans this morning? I was about to go to the market. Do you want to have breakfast at the beach? Let's watch them surf. -Let's go. -Can I have pancakes? Sure. I'm glad you dropped by. I really didn't want to go to the market. I still hate cooking, you know… -Do you remember when… -You were saying? No, nothing. Here is yours. Aren't you glad you came with me? So who inherited this resort? My aunt. I couldn't keep too many business interests in my political district, so I let them go. Too bad. You were always good at business. We can't all be surfing philosophers. Is that them? Don't worry. She just needs practice. This is delicious. Do they know we're here? I guess he couldn't hear me. "Uncle Vic" is what you called Rich's father? Yeah, sometimes. You really were like brothers. We're the only two here with famous dads, so we understood each other. -Can I really do this? -Take it slow. You can't become an expert in one day. My mother still surfs. She must be really good. Yeah, that's what she's good at. Surfing. -Why, what's she not good at? -At being a mother. Why is that? My mother did what she had to do, or what she could, but… -She was young. -Really. Because she was young? We, young mothers, don't know what we're doing. Is that it? -I didn't mean… -Fine, I get it. She doesn't like doing the laundry. So to lessen the load, I wore nothing at home. Only board shorts, sometimes without underwear. I never changed my son's diapers. Not once. I let the nanny do it. There were times my mother didn't feel like paying the electric bill. Then she made it my job to fix it. She made me climb up the power lines to tap electricity. I was seven. When I was at the mall with my son, and I saw a cute guy, I'd say Jose was my brother. My mother kept half of the school allowance that Uncle Vic gave me. Jose never made it to his first birthday. Boom. What happened between you and Rich? What? Whenever I asked Rich, he'd say it's kid stuff. -There. We grew up. -Then why were you mad at him yesterday? I'm not mad at him. To Rich. The angriest man on the planet. Who's that? Ford, come in. Come in. -I'll just take a shower. -Okay. I'll head home. No, stay. I have a surprise for you. Come. I bumped into her this afternoon in town, so I invited her for dinner. You're a vegetarian. Here, let's eat. No, I'm good. And you've already started. Well, in that case… You can drink that, or you can break it. Up to you. First time I smoked was with Ford. And guess who else? That was my first time too. We were hiding from your mom, but she caught us. She entered the room… I taught them the proper way to roll. It's kicking. Is Ford up? There you are. Sure. If there's time. -Hey, Rich! -Chona! You said you wanted to help out with the bonfire? Yes, of course! -Right now? -Yes. Let's go. Let's face it. I'm hopeless. You just need to practice. If there's life, there's hope. Why's Fiona so good? She makes it look easy. Everything is easy for Fiona. How about you? I started really early. When you're a kid, everything is easy. This one, you'll have to pay for. Five? Five roasted pigs. If the congressman says five roasted pigs, then five it is. Yes, on Friday. Okay, thanks! -Five pigs, really? -Really. Five pigs. I thought you were vegetarian. Come here. I'll have the glass in the frame replaced. Anything else you want fixed? Is that so? So, this won't… I'll just go then. How are you? For your grandma. -Grandma loves these! -I know! Grandma Jess, it's Chona. I'm sorry that Ford hasn't visited yet. He's teaching a lot these days. But he'll drop by soon. Hey! Careful! Don't die yet! Not bad. A round of applause for the brave graduate of Ford's School of Surfing. I'm enrolling her in your advanced class. Of course! Right now? Not right now. Sure. Good. She's in your hands. You're the boss. I'll pack the boards. Rich is so insistent on our lessons. When your boyfriend gets hurt, he gets even. But I'm not hurting him. As long as you're a person, you're hurting Rich. He's just testing us. I don't want to surf anymore. Not ever. Just today. Where's your son? Jose? In Manila. There's an altar at home. I couldn't bury him. Are you okay? I'm sorry, I don't… Don't worry. I'm okay. I just don't want to surf anymore today. Let's go. Rich told me about this place. Did he tell you everything? Not everything. What's down below? Ghosts and spirits. There are old towns under the water. When the dam was built, everyone from down there was relocated. My grandfather was from here. Even Rich's grandfather. But from a different town. I still don't understand how Rich's dad could do that to Rich. And to you. I'm okay. It's nothing. Rich bore the brunt of it. Each time the old governor came home, we'd tremble in fear. One of us would surely get beaten. But Uncle Vic never picked on me. Not once. It was Rich. But you witnessed it every day. This is where they blew up stuff in Apocalypse Now. Have you seen it? If you saw the explosions, they were taller than the trees! Many say that the river shifted because of that. Can a river move? That I don't know. I wasn't there. I wasn't born yet. -"May we pass"? -"May we pass"? So you're superstitious? Not really. Why did you ask the earth spirit for passage? Because I'm used to it. That means you believe a bit. Sure. We can do that. How is Grandma Jess doing? -Why? -Nothing really. It's just that you haven't checked in with your family recently. Your family might be looking for you already. That's up to you. Why are there only three pigs? I asked for five. Hey, why are there only three? Didn't I ask for five pigs? Say that again. I didn't hear you. I want to know why there are only three pigs. I ordered five pigs. -Answer me! -Rich! I forgot to tell you. The two other pigs are coming from the other town, and they're running late. -Is that okay? -Yeah, it's okay. No problem. -This looks great. -I'm having the light bulbs fixed. There you go! -You like it? -Yes, I do. Good job. She's so beautiful. I thought that was you. When Jess dies, then you'll know how young you are. She's still alive. You're in Baler. Just enjoy your time here. The surf competition is coming. This year it's going to be exciting. Ford never really had any competition, but he does this year. -Andres? -Yes. His style is exciting. He challenges the waves. Ford just goes with the waves. When Ford lost three years ago, he said he was just bored with the waves that day. But I saw him step off the board. It's like he was trying to surf without a board. Some say there was an apparition, a mermaid calling him under the water. Like the old fishermen's tales. He lost. Do you want me to just look at these? Are you mad? You see what I can do? That's Jordan. Put that down. You're just 14, Ballsack. Fuck. Why'd you give him your drink? Pour two for us. That's how I am when I'm in love. I flirt with other people as well. Here you are about to marry the congressman, going around with this asshole. Have another shot. Here's to you assholes. Grow up already, bitches. Good evening, everyone. I'm happy that you were able to meet my bride-to-be, Serena. I want you all to know how excited we are to be married in my hometown. Now that's not the only good news tonight. You all know Chona, a true child of Baler. And we all know her story of how she came to be the mother of my good friend, Ford. With the help of our new congressman… We've spoken to the lawyers of the director. And they've agreed to send people next week… to administer a paternity test! Let us toast! This is for Chona. We lost. Rich always wins. Just like his father. His father was sick when I met him. But was he really that bad? He was Satan. But you loved him. I called him Papa. Why is Rich's high school diploma with you? He gave it to me as a gift. I never finished high school. Why not? I needed to earn money for our family. I was earning as a surfing instructor. So why not? And my mom said… the director was going to bring us to Napa Valley any day. I could go to school there. That's sad. Not really. We can't all go to Stanford Law. Wake up. You'll be late for your surfing lessons. Hello! Let's go. I should go. No. Stay. Fi… Relax, the DNA testers just crossed the dam. Have a seat. How are you? Okay. Are you ready? Now we will know the truth. The truth. Bro, what's up? -We just want to get some stash. -Just stay there. -Can we go in? It's so hot. -Just stay there. I'll be quick. What about her? Let's go. Why do they call this place Reserva? A tsunami hit Baler a long time ago. Everything was wiped out. Only seven families survived. The survivors decided to prepare for the next one. They founded this reservation, the Reserva, so that… they can move in case another tsunami hits. -But it hasn't been used yet? -Not yet. It's a reservation. That's what it's for. To reserve in case of emergency. So if you're not using it, let others use it. But it is being used as a reserve. Where's your other shoe? Have I ever told you the story? Which one? The story about Ford's father and how I got pregnant. Do you want to know? My father said I should be wary of a person wearing one shoe. Two shoes is normal. No shoes is acceptable. But one shoe? Dangerous. I was only 14 when I got pregnant. I was just hanging around outside the set. There were so many foreigners. They were handsome and tall. One time, some of the men started to notice me. They touched my hair, my cheeks. My cousin got angry. He punched one of them, and a fight broke out. Until we heard a voice. Everyone became quiet. Then he approached me, the man in shades. He removed his shades and looked at me. He smiled. He said… He brought me to his tent. It was nice, and it even had air-conditioning. I didn't even know about air-conditioning. He said the shooting was delayed because of the rain in the Philippines. He gave me some champagne. It was sour and bitter, but also sweet. Next thing I knew, he was already on top of me. On a bed in the tent. He kissed me and said… that he will take care of me forever. Any questions? Where is your other shoe? -I tossed it in the sea. -Why? I thought I saw something. What did you see? I don't know. Hey, where did the rest of the fish go? Why don't you grill? You're so particular. You invited us. Ford, I have a question. Why don't you just take the test? What for? Because your mom wants you to. We know the results anyway, so why should I take the test? Rich was angry at me. Before he left for college, he left me a police report. Elmer Pearson. He was an extra in the movie. He raped my mom. But then Rich's dad covered it up. Rich told me. The whole town knows. It's done. Don't think about it. Did he tell you why? I did nothing. I didn't do anything. Motherfucker! What's your problem? -Let's talk about this. -How about her? Do you love her? Shit. -Just stop. -No. We can talk about this! What do you want? -Why? -Can you just please stop it. Please. Enough. Stop. Please, enough already. Tell me what you want to do. Do you want to beat me up? Go ahead. Hit me. Stand up and hit me. Hard. Is that all? One more. Give it your all! Is that it? Can you just stop? Enough already! Fuck you! Can we do it in 30 minutes? Ma, I'm okay. I just need to talk to Rich. It's time. Take the test. That can wait. Let's talk first. There is nothing to talk about. Come on, Ford. Take the test-- Tell you what. Come with me first, and I'll take the fucking test after. Let's go then. Let's talk. What's that? You know I can't go in the water. I know about your ear. I saw everything. I should've done something. But… I thought you were dead. I saw your brain on the floor. That wasn't my brain. It was just my ear. If only I had confessed to your dad, it wouldn't have happened. I never understood why it was always you. Why was it always you? Even if it was my fault, he blamed you. -He was teaching us a lesson. -I didn't learn anything. I learned a lot. And on that day, I learned everything. Did you know? He stopped talking to us when you left. When you were still around… He was like a father to me. But when you left for college… Mama and I didn't hear from him again. Did you know that? He's dead now. He's dead. It took a while. I thought I was going to feel better, but… That's because you don't surf. Okay then. Let's go. Fuck it. Wait. Just to be safe. You look stupid, bro. Rich, sorry to Serena. Sorry to your mom. Set. What did you just say? What did you say?
