See you in nine and a half hours. Here I am. Just to have a small talk with you. Selina, you frightened me. How did you get in? The back door was open. Has your baby come yet? Oh, no. When I wanted a baby, I just got it in a box. Where is your baby? It's leg came off and it got dead. Oh, I'm so sorry. I don't mind, I've got a mouse, with fur. It smells of breadcrumbs, but it got no fur on its tail because it's so old. What will you baby be like when it comes? Oh, about the size of this bear but with everything marvelously new. It will have Slate colored eyes, face with a rather stern expression. And tiny little hands that hold onto your fingers so tightly that you can't get away. Well, I wish there were a lot of babies in my home. Nothing but blooming... Oh, Selina. Mrs. Olson says that all the time when things are nice. Well come along Mrs. Olson and help me with the blooming beds, the blooming washing up and the blooming housework. Good morning Lawrence. Oh, good morning Sir. You'll be glad to hear that I did my homework. I spent last night on your plan. And... I am really rather pleased with them. Simple, dramatic, and some very pretty drawing. I'm glad you like them. It would take a devil of a time to produce them. We're way over schedule so I am calling a preliminary conference with all heads of department 3 o'clock this afternoon. Okay with you? Must it be this afternoon, Sir? Oh, dear fellow, did you have burglars or just a maniac? No, I just got behind with one or two things Sir. Oh, what on earth is your secretary for? She left last week. Said she couldn't find things, and she left. We can't go on like this. This job has got to have top priority. We're going to be working very hard. I suppose I will have to lend you my Mrs. Reed. Do you really think you can spare her, Sir? Oh, I can't have my leading architect working in a bear garden. I will speak to Mrs. Reed right away. And I want you at 3 o'clock, not ten past. Three sharp. Right Sir. Oh, that will be Jeff. How do you know? Because he's the person who rings me up. Hi. I knew it would be you. I had a sneaking suspicion it might be you. What news? My daily help has arrived. We nearly finished the housework, then I am going shopping. And you? Crawford insists on lending me his secretary. He must think your marvelous if he is lending you his own secretary. The point is I don't like being organized. Except by you. We'll probably come to blows. You know how I like having everything within reach under my hands. She'll file everything. Keep badgering me for details. All with the word tact in capital letters. And that my darling is the end of the news. Good morning, Mr, Lawrence. All right, I know what you've been sent for. Go ahead. Reduce everything to order. Do you like things under your feet as well as under your hands? Well, it depends on what it is. What's that for? Details, all of the ones you don't want. I'm going to sort your mail. Mr. Lawrence? Can he call you back? I'm afraid Mr. Lawrence is extremely busy. Thank you. Look. Oh, dear, how did you do it? I fell right down off my scooter and mummy is out. We must clean that up at once. You are a brave girl. Mummy keeps all the medicines in the bathroom. Most people do. But Mr, Lawrence says nearly all accidents happen in the kitchen. And that's the place to have them. Now we will do your knee first Selina. Oh, it's a nasty graze. My arm is worse because it's nearer to me. I should have to put some iodine on this knee Selina. I can't get all the dirt out. Will it hurt? Oh, it will sting a little. What like wicked wasps? No. Wait, I'll see if I have anything else that won't hurt. Ah, here we are. Something magic. This won't hurt at all. Watch. All the water will go purple. Will it make me purple forever? Oh, only for a little while. But then the people will see how brave you've been. Would you be brave? Well I'm not brave at all. There. Mr, Lawrence again, he'd rather interrupt us. Hello, Oh, hello, Agnes... Ah Lawrence, On time. I'm terribly Sorry Sir I'm afraid I've left my papers in my office. They are on the desk. Now. Mr, Crawford's office. Somebody calling to know when Mr. Lawrence will be leaving? Well we've got a good three hours work. Mr. Lawrence will not be leaving until after six, who wants him? Sit down Lawrence. Palmer has a list of the points I want him to raise. Now. The gentleman wouldn't leave his name, I'm afraid he's rung off Mrs. Reade, so sorry. Now gentlemen the main problems we have are those of reconciling space with privacy and both with costs. Isn't that right? Yes, goodbye. That was your mummy wondering where you are. It's lunchtime and she's taking you to dancing class so you must rush home. My mouse can't go to dancing class, he's too old. You'll be all right by yourself? I won't be by myself, I expect I'll meet someone. ...and then Mrs. Lawrence put on the magic stuff and I'm going to dancing class all the afternoon, but I won't dance very well because I've hurt myself and so I can't stay with Mrs. Lawrence anymore today. And so, when the man has cleaned her windows poor Mrs. Lawrence will be all alone. Oh, thanks very much. Cheerio see you next month. Bye. Goodbye. What do you want? What is it? I've been waiting, waiting, waiting. Don't touch me. I thought I was going mad. It's locked. They're both locked. I've thought of everything, I've been very clever, but I can't wait any longer. I won't hurt you, I won't hurt you. Thank you very much. Would you like to come in for a quick drink? No thank you, not tonight. There's something wrong with our telephone and my wife will be wondering where I am. Of course. I expect she's wondering what's happened to you. This will burn you, mark you for life. You little bitch. Let go. Let go. Tracey! Tracey! Tracey! Tracey! Tracey... Oh, Geoff! Accident, emergency. Dr. Allison to casualty please. Dr. Allison to casualty please. Mr. Lawrence? Yes. I'm Sister Holden, your wife has just come back from the theater, I expect you'd like to see her for a moment? Is she alright? Yes she's going to be quite all right. But I'm afraid... Your husband has come to see you Mrs. Lawrence. Not really crying, I must be rather tired. You drove and drove and there were lights all down the passage. It's all right my dear little love, It's all right. And I lost my baby? Oh, no! There will be others my darling, We still have each other, that's all that matters. I'm with you, you are not alone. Mr. Lawrence the police are here. Okay Reg, test for me please. Okay thank you. You are quite certain that your wife said nothing to you either here or in the car which might help us at all? No I told you she was unconscious, she was in pain. God if I could get my hands on him. Yeah we've got to get him before he tries it on anyone else. Hogans, what on earth have you done to yourself? Put my hand on the table where that liquid was spilled. My wife got some of that stuff on her hands too. Did she now? If any of that spilt on him. And the police believe it possible that there may be purple stains on his face or hands. How could you do that to me? Now, er, what was your main impression of this man? I was on the ladder. I looked down and he was holding it. Well was he fair or dark? He was wearing white gloves. He took them off. Go on Mrs. Lawrence you are doing fine. Was there anything special about him, his voice for instance? Did he speak to you? Yes, yes he said he'd been waiting and waiting, and then when I threw the stuff at him he said, "You bitch." - You through the liquid at him? - Yes, I said this will burn you, to frighten him. Of course it wouldn't have burned him it was the stuff for Selina's knee. But I was so frightened I wanted it to burn him. At least I didn't want to hurt him so much I just wanted him to go away because it was so long you see. He went on, and on, like an explosion not stopping and I had such an awful pain. Did the stuff go on him? All over his face. You've been very helpful indeed Mrs. Lawrence and very brave. That's the trouble, I'm not brave. I'm not brave at all. That should do you miss. Thank you very much. Mr. Lawrence in yet? Not yet. One minute, who wants him? The Mercury, the mail and the news have been on the line too. Tell them I don't want to speak to any blasted reporters. Tell her to say I'm away. Tell them we are very sorry but Mr. Lawrence is not available today. How is your wife? Getting on, I think. Could I do anything to help? I would love to visit her. No she's not allowed anyone at the moment except me of course. It's nice of you to suggest it. You know she lost the baby? Oh, no, I didn't know that. I'm so very sorry for both of you. When I think of what must have been going on last night and I was driving home I can understand why people want to kill one another. There must be a million women that live in this place waiting for their husbands to come home. There are a lot of women who are alone who haven't got husbands. I suppose so. Hey, does this desk mean you are on indefinite loan? Only till this scheme is completed. Mr. Crawford's orders. I see. What sort of flowers would you like best if you were in hospital? Very dark red roses. They are lovely. Thank you darling. Goodbye. You are tired. Those darned policeman have warn you out. Never mind, when I see Dr. Shaw I'll put a stop to all that. They shan't come again. Yes don't let them I don't want anyone. Except me of course. Goodbye my darling love. Well I'll see you early tomorrow morning. Oh, what's the matter. When she does come home she's going to need the utmost patience, protection, and understanding. She needs to feel safe. Above all she needs to feel loved. Without any demands made on her. Any demands at all. Are you trying to tell me that I mustn't make love to her? I'm trying to warn you that she may not want you to. In fact she may not be able to tolerate it at all. But we really are in love. That would help her to get better all the sooner. The only real cure for frigidity is the right kind of love. ...it occurred to me that you might be tired of living out of tins. So tired that there aren't any left. Come in. I'm afraid everything is in a bit of a mess. However, I do have some Sherry and about two clean glasses. Would you like a drink? Very much, but first show me where to spread the food. Is everything out of the living room? Yes ma'am, and the bedroom, and the bathroom. In fact the whole place is looking quite stark. Hey hey, dry those before you put them away. Bossy too! What does your husband have to say about your passion for order? He isn't there to say anything. Poor Helen, here my grumbling about being on my own for a few weeks. Is he at sea or something? I haven't the slightest idea. He walked out two years ago and I've never heard another word from him. It's tough on you. It was. Now it's just quiet and empty. There, I'd like a cigarette. On the fridge. Oh, my hands are wet. I really am very grateful for all of this. Du Rien. What? French for, don't mention it. Look Sir I know it's eight days but that doesn't alter the fact that we didn't get the call till over an hour after he got away. Well let me see what you've got. Yes Sir, right away Sir. The super wants a list of all the areas where we've completed house to house searching. In order to tell me I've picked the wrong areas I suppose. You know I don't think he's still here. I think he beat it right after. Got a hitch or something like that. Favor the superintendent with your views when you take that list in to him. You said yourself he didn't stand a chance in the district. All the radios and newspapers and people jabbering about the purple stains. I don't fancy the pub myself not while I've got this lot on. Well keep washing millions, keep washing. You can bet your life he will be. And once your hands clean, we don't stand a chance. So I thought of a wonderful plan. Darling put that away you'll get rheumatism surrounded by all those sopping hankies. Sorry I do try but I just don't seem to have the spirit of a field mouse. Well I happen to know that they are terrifically brave. Listen, I'm going to take you away. Right away? Yes for a proper holiday. We haven't had one since our honeymoon. I just want to be alone with you. You can pretend that you hardly know me that we've only just met. I'll be with you all the time to take care of you. We just happen to have the same name. Hey you haven't smiled like that for a fortnight. It's not that I won't let you get away my dear fellow, I can't this new scheme of yours has reached a point where we can't do without you. July on the other hand I can promise. Then July it will have to be Sir. Weather is better then. Lawrence, I don't like refusing you, you know. Well? Oh, Lord, why does one's private and professional life always have to clash? I've never managed to have both at once. Got your cigarettes, here. Thank you Geoff. It's I who should thank you. My house would be a shambles without my personal assistant. Just a part of the Crawford service. You build the houses and we keep them clean. You must meet Tracey. Well, I don't suppose she'll be wanting to meet anybody new just yet. Wait till she's feeling strong again. She'll be so glad to get out of that hospital, I can't wait to get her home. Oh, well there's three weeks in July to look forward to anyway. Please unpack my soap sister, I must wash. Don't fret yourself about your hands. It'll all wear off in time and you'll forget it was ever there. Just think how nice it will be to get home again. The awful thing is, I don't really want to go home. I know I ought to, but I don't. Many people feel like that you know. Do they? They get used to being on an island in bed. Afraid they won't be able to cope with everyday life. Oh, it's not only that. Apart from the safe quiet feeling, I shall miss you all. Especially you. You know you won't be able to remember my name in six months time. I'm sure I shall. You'd be surprised. Now the night pills are green, your day ones are red. Go on taking them until Dr. Shaw calls a halt. Your husband will be here at any minute. Don't go. What does your husband do? He worked for an airline. He was killed in an accident. Now Mrs. Lawrence I won't have you getting upset about that. I suppose I'm really very lucky. I've never held very much of luck. You can't change what happens to you. Only how you are about it. Your husband is as pleased as punch to be getting you home. I should think about that if I were you. I quite see why you are a special nurse. One field mouse all present and correct. That's my girl. Thank you, goodbye. I'm terribly sorry I've forgotten your name. Holden. I had no idea so much was smashed up. Darling, I'm so glad to have you back. Don't! I'll go. It's your friend. I'm just going to collect your case from the car. Here I am at last. I am glad to see you. I know you've been very sad, so would you like my mouse? It's my best thing so you will be very pleased won't you. Very pleased and honored. Ready? One, two, three, go! I'll go. You can have your bath now if you like darling. My name is McInnes. I'm from Scotland Yard. Mrs. Lawrence, I'm sorry to bother you at this hour, my name is McInnes. The inspector is from Scotland Yard darling. Oh, won't you sit down. Thank you. I suppose you've come to ask me all the same old questions? No, no, I won't bother you with those. I was able to read the file coming up in the train today. I sympathize with you, they really did take you over the same ground didn't they? It's really just that I'm taking over the case and I thought it would be a good idea for me to meet you both. Why have you taken it over inspector? Well, we don't like these things left in the air, and it's very nice country around here. Have you always lived here Mrs. Lawrence? No, I was in London before we married, I worked there. Model? How on earth did you guess that? Well it's not everyone who can wear clothes, is it? I've given it all up now that, it doesn't go with marriage. Would you like a drink inspector? Yes I would thanks. I'll get some ice. Did you go out at all that day Mrs. Lawrence? I went shopping. Where? In the supermarket. I dropped a lot of parcels and somebody helped me to pick them up. Were they wearing gloves? The same. I'm sorry I seem to of spoilt your game of cards, didn't I? Is that a mouse you've got there? That wretched child brought it. Selina is not wretched, she's my friend. Did she come that morning? She came twice. She went back home for lunch. It was for her that I mixed the... Oh, yes, yes of course. Does she live near here? Oh, about 300 yards up the road. Cigarette? Yes, thanks. So you are the secret smoker. We had a pact about smoking before we married inspector then I found millions of cigarette stubs around the dustbins. When did you find them? Oh, lots of times but I thought it was one of the workmen. Sorry darling would you like a drink? No thank you all I want is a gorgeous bath, unless you want to ask me anything more inspector. Oh, no, no, nothing at all. It's, er, been delightful meeting you. Well there is one more thing. Yes. If you are ever worried about anything, please don't hesitate to call the station and ask for me anytime, day or night. Thank goodness for telephone. Good night. Good night. There'll be some hot milk after your bath. Yes please. You've made quite a hit with Tracey. I suppose they brought you in because they are starting a nationwide search. Isn't it rather like looking for a needle in a haystack. I mean he might be anywhere by now. What is it inspector? Why have you come here? Are you the heavy smoker Mr. Lawrence? No I'm not. I only started again about a week ago. That's what I thought. That man isn't just anywhere, I'm certain he still here. He's not just an indiscriminate sex maniac, he's got an obsession about your wife. But the police based all their questions on the idea that he may attack somebody else. They haven't caught him and he hasn't attacked. I don't think they are right. Oh, Lord. It's very sensible for you not to alarm your wife about the cigarette stubs. Those dustbins are outside the bedroom window. I've got to take her away, got to get her out of all this. Don't do that Mr. Lawrence, stay here or we'll never catch him. What do you mean? He'll be back. Just as soon as those stains have worn off, he'll be back. Of course. Pointed toes and a pointy hat and a pointy nose and they are pointy one years old. Yesterday they married someone very wicked so I don't go for walks with them but now I've made a tiny little man round all over so all the other people have gone because he's so nice. Goodbye. No I'm afraid they are not quite ready yet Sir. I know I had them last week there's been so much... I'm sorry... Yes? Lawrence but I want your pros and cons on all three estimates first thing tomorrow morning. Take them home, work all night and be in my office at nine sharp. The inspector. Good morning to you inspector. No, the stains haven't quite done yet, I'll check again tonight. There's nothing new I suppose? You do wash a lot. Do you wish you were sea lion? I'dather be a elephant because they each have a special person who washes them. Could we see it? I don't know. We could ask if he went to the zoo. Oh, yes, now shall we go? Now it's too late. People never do things now and won't let children. Oh, Selena, I promise we'll go to the zoo tomorrow. Cross your heart and hope to die. Oh, let go! It's all right darling. It's all right. It's me, Geoff. Don't let him come near me. Don't let him touch me. Sorry, I had a bad dream. Geoff, I wish none of this had ever happened. It's my bad dream all day. Hold my hand. All right Vicki he's here. Suppose the old man's been shouting. I forestalled him said your car had been giving trouble and you'd sent a message, apologies, etc. I think he'll be all right. You don't look as though you have slept much. That's the truth. You are an extraordinary girl, so calm and collected, nothing seems to rattle you. It's my job to look calm. Aren't you calm? I was, but I seem to have lost it. You can hold up for weeks with canned food. Any messages for me? No nothing of any use. The usual nuts who sat next to him in the flix and got followed home. He must have his own premises. How's Williams hand? Oh, the mark is still visible. Well you know where to find me if anything comes in. Ah huh. Oh, good morning Sir. Hello Sergeant. What you think of the chemist's story? I haven't heard it. Only some chemist rang in to say his girl had sold a man some pancake makeup last night, just before closing time. Did he? Get me Mrs. Lawrence on the telephone. Lots of husbands buy their wife's makeup. There's no reply. Well go on ringing. Now look I want all messages, repeat all messages the moment they come in. Well she's out. But she wouldn't be if I got that message in time. I'm sorry inspector but Mr. Lawrence is in conference and I simply can't disturb him at the moment. Of course does he know the number? There we go. Wait for me. Wait for me. Mary, quick get some water. Stand back children stand back. The lady is very sick. And you had no idea you were being followed on the way to the zoo? None. Thank you, Won't you? No not just now thank you. You left a note on your back door. Yes to tell the daily I'd gone. Oh! He's been here again inspector. He's after me, isn't he? Not anyone else. No, he's after you. You know it's a relief to know that. Is it? Well, it must make it easier for you. And it means all the other people are safe doesn't it? Yes, I suppose it does mean that. I never thought of what it was like for the people to whom these things happen. I admire your courage Mrs. Lawrence. Oh, I haven't got any. One day you may find you're wrong about that, quite wrong. Tracey! I just got your message, darling what happened to you? I went to the zoo with Selina and the man was there. Your wife fainted. Didn't you notice her hands? Yes I did, last night at about one thirty. But I had a meeting that was supposed to start at 9 o'clock this morning and I was late. Well now we know and we can certainly prevent it from happening again. Agnes. How lovely to see you. Where is Selina? I haven't seen her for three days. That's really what I came about Tracey dear. I do hope you understand. You don't want her to come here anymore. That's it isn't it? I mean, who knows he may be lurking in one of the uninhabited houses simply waiting to pounce on her. But all the houses have been searched. No, of course I see what you mean. I expect I'd feel the same if I had a child. It was good of you to come Agnes. Are you coming tomorrow? I haven't a moment all week I'm afraid. Tracey, I wouldn't mind. It's Roger, he says this is the most dangerous place. He won't hear of my coming. And we had quite a row about it. I'm so sorry. I hope we shall meet soon again. When all this dreadful business is cleared up. I expect I'd feel the same if I had a child. Hello darling, Geoff is that you? This is Mrs. Lawrence speaking. I know who you are. You've made things very difficult for me. It's not kind at all, I just want you to know that however much they watch you, I'll find a way. I'll never give up. I'll wait, and wait, and suddenly one day when they are tired of watching for me, I'll be there. Only this time Tracey... I'll take you away. Tracey! Where are you darling? Darling what on earth are you doing? I was washing my hair but I was interrupted. You mustn't sit there with your head dripping wet. You get your death, as my mother would say. I wish I had a mother to say that to me. Now you dry your hair and I'll get you a nice stiff whiskey. You're always sorry for yourself when you're feeling cold. Yes you are quite right, I'm sorry darling. But I do wish I had an enormous dull family that would put up with anything. Here's to the future, Tracey love. May I kiss you? I might have just as well married an Irish water spaniel. Now you've done it. I'll take it. Hello, hello. Wasn't anybody. Yes it was. What is it Tracey? It was him, he phoned while I was washing my hair. He said no matter how much they watch me he'd find a way, He'd never give up. Oh, Geoff, I'm not sure how much more of this I can stand. Is there anything else that you want to check with me? No I don't think so. When he calls I've got to keep him talking. I mustn't sound too horrified and I mustn't sound to calm. And the longer I can go on the better. Yup that's it. Good luck. Hello... This is Mrs. Lawrence. It won't make any difference in the end. So why don't you send him away. Yes? Right, trace it. Alert all patrol cars to stand by. Look why don't you leave me alone? Ever since I first saw you I've tried. There were photographs of you. You walk down a flight of steps smiling straight towards me. And just as you would have been in my arms, you stopped. Come on, come on. She can't keep him talking all bloody night. But why do you have to pick on me? It was London, you wore a dress without sleeves. And long white gloves. I could've touched you and then your smile went out and I saw that you thought I was a stranger. Call box at the junction of Queen Street and Castle Road. Twenty-three and twenty-six are the nearest. I've got dozens of pictures of you, All cut out. But I can't get near enough to you. What I would really like is... Hasn't struck you that nobody could possibly like you if you do these things. It doesn't matter what happens to either of us afterwards. Why you bastard. Who's that? Who is it? There's someone there. I'm here, I'm here. You are not alone. Traitor! If only you'd have kept him talking just a little bit longer Mrs. Lawrence we would've had them. I'm afraid it was all my fault. Geoff, I think I'm going to bed I feel rather tired. Yes of course I will keep you any longer. Don't worry we'll catch him next time for sure. I've got to go through all that again? Mrs. Lawrence, I'll do everything I can to find him without your having to go through another ordeal but if I can't... No thanks I can't face that this morning. Hey isn't that rather a waste? I'm not eating cold scrambled eggs for lunch if that's what you mean. I didn't mean that. Is there any coffee? Mind out! Geoff what's the matter with you? What do you mean I'm just tired that's all. I didn't mean that. If you want to know my headaches, and the thought of a hard days work fills me with something like nausea. I wish I had a days work. At least to take your mind off everything else. Surely you could find something to do instead of sitting around in a trance of self-pity and fright. What could I do? You tell me, I which I could find something to do at your office. You've no qualifications to do any work there, you can't even type. Can Mrs. Reade? What are her qualifications? Helen happens to be a trained secretary. Added to that she's exceptionally intelligent. Oh, well I'm sorry I'm not a trained secretary and I'm sorry I'm not exceptionally intelligent. You're not at all. Sure you're not sorry you married me? You are bad tempered because you're drinking too.. You are upset because of that frightful call last night. Look, Tracey, we are both overwrought this doesn't make sense. Simply because Helen happens to be my personal assistant... You never told me that. Well I'm telling you now. Anyway leave her out of it. Look I know you are going through an awful time and it's most unfair of me to snap, I know you can help it. You could've helped it last night, if you hadn't shouted when that man was on the telephone. The police would have caught him and it would be all over now. Do you realize what you've done? Look Tracey, I said I'm sorry about that. Now don't upset yourself. Stop treating me as though I were made of glass. Well what are you may of then, ice? I'm just an ordinary man remember. I married you because I love you, to have children with you. That hasn't changed. Do you know what it's been like sleeping in the same bed with you night after night, seeing your face if I touch you just because for one single second I forgot that I mustn't do that. I have tried. I have been patient, but I'm not superhuman. Either I love you or I don't. It's as simple as that. Which do you do? I don't know forget it, I'm late. There are no if's and buts, either your men have carried out a proper house to house or they haven't. I appreciate that... Now what about this area here? Have you investigated it? And these intersections here, here, and here. Yeah that's been covered, I happen to know. Do you also happen to know whether, what are they, Garibaldi, Bismarck, and Napoleon roads have been searched? Not absolutely certain... Then what the hell is the point of crossing things off if you haven't done them? Get me the superintendant. What the hell's the point of doing things if you don't cross them off? Why didn't you answer? Why didn't you say something? I said I'm sorry and anyway that's not why you are bad tempered. What the hell are you talking about? Your wife's position is intolerable. Why don't you do something about it instead of complaining about the police being slow? What can I do? Take her away somewhere where she feels safe. Because as you very well know Crawford won't let me go. Send her away then. Then at least that man won't know where she is. But the police want him to know. There isn't anything I can do. She just doesn't seem able to face up to the situation. Can you? Not my own part of it, no, I can't. If she'll go, I'm going to take her away. To hell with the project. Either I love you or I don't, it's as simple as that. She wouldn't be out shopping would she? Well not all this time, anyway she's taken to shopping by telephone. Your chap is there isn't he? Oh, yes he's there all right. Look, I'll go over and see Mrs. Lawrence at once and I'll call you right back. Right thanks inspector. I'm not going to leave it at that. I'm going home myself. You've made me see things rather differently. Bless you for that. When will you be back? I don't know. I'll call you later. One pound, eighteen and sixty if you please. Which platform please? Catching the two seven are you? Isn't there anything sooner than that? Two seven's the first London train, platform seven when it comes. Thank you. There are three families living there. She's got a couple of kids and the old man is dead. Eighty year old couple on the ground floor and a blind boy and his mother on top. What about the basement? Bloke who owns the place supposed to live there but he's been away for weeks. Well considering the buck thats been passed back at the station we better have a reccy. Oh, all right. No there's nothing doing. He must be away. He's got a cat though he can't have been a for weeks with that. Isn't that? Come on! Mcinnis here, Mrs. Lawrence probably trying to leave town. I want you to alert all patrol cars. If you have any contact, ring me right? Very good Sir. Yes and she's probably carrying some sort of case, Right. Well, why the hell didn't your man stop her? Our man was protecting your wife with her cooperation. The moment she doesn't want that, what's the matter did you have a row? Yeah, it's all my fault. Oh, never mind about that now. Not come on Lawrence concentrate, try and think. Where would she have gone? Friends here? London? Another country? Hello, McInnis. You have, where? Right, keep two men on, tell them to move their car and I'll be right over. Have you got him? No, but we found out where he lives. London, that's where she'd go. She hasn't got anybody here, I'm going to the airport. Know we've covered the airport. You try the railway station. Do you remember selling a ticket to a young lady in a leather coat? Not in the last ten minutes. I didn't say in the last ten minutes, anytime in the last two hours. I've only been on for ten minutes. Look here I'll miss my train. What platform is the London train? There is an indicator board outside Sir. Platform ticket please. Yes Sir, tuppence please. No Madam, number two on the left. Run, there you go Miss. You're too late now Miss! You can't do that Miss. Tracey! Tracey! Tracey... I do love you. It's as simple as that. Shall we go home now? Need we, yet? You've come to hate it, haven't you? He spoilt it. He somehow filled the whole house so that it doesn't belong to us anymore. I'm going to take you away. Today? Yes, they just have to do without me for three weeks. When we come back we'll move. We won't stay there any longer, You'd like that wouldn't you? Yes. Mrs. Lawrence. We've got him. Oh, no. Thank God for that. Look I'm sorry I'm afraid there's one thing more you're going to have to do for us. It's a mere formality Mrs. Lawrence but you are the only one who has seen him. That is he. Look what you've done to me. What she's done to you, why you bastard! It's you that has nearly killed her. They're going to shut you up and I hope you never get out. All right Mr. Lawrence, that's enough. Do you want that? Of course she does, she loathes you. No doubts Mrs. Lawrence? No. That is he. I'll never forget what you've done to me. I'll get you. You'll see, I'll get you. You'll learn. I'll get you. I'll get you. Let me go. Mrs. Lawrence. I'm afraid you don't understand Mr. Crawford. I really want to leave. I feel it's time I made a complete change. I thought of taking a job abroad. Now listen to me, Helen. You want to change, and you said you wanted to go abroad. I've got to send a couple of people to Saigon. Your French would be invaluable but otherwise you'll have very little to do. You get a holiday. Three weeks, all expenses paid. How's that? Sounds wonderful. Now I'm not bribing you. Well I am, of course. But I can't think of anyone better to send. Thank you. When would I have to go? Ah, let's see now, Lawrence comes back at the end of the week. In about ten days I should think. Lawrence? Oh, didn't I explain? He'll be going with you of course, it's his scheme. He doesn't know I shall be springing it on him when he comes back. Here we are. Darling I'm so grateful we've moved. Darling it's after one, you must come and get some sleep if you're going to start work tomorrow. Well that's why I wanted to get things straight. Well, they are straight by my standards, come on. But your standards Mr. Lawrence are known to be low. Simmonds can hang the pictures. Simmonds? Oh, the caretaker. He thinks you are wonderful. Darling? Uh huh. That man is locked up isn't he? You want to be married to me don't you? You do want it, and you do want to have another child, don't you Tracey? Couldn't you trust me now? Darling come away from there. Are you even more afraid of me than you are of heights? I'm more afraid of heights. Come on, come and get some sleep. For once I don't have to explain why I'm late. The old man has been telling me about Saigon. Some prospect. What's your order, Sir? The usual please, Harry. Here's your sandwich. Three weeks in a wonderful country. 6 halves of bitter, I'll wait. And I'm sure you're the perfect person to travel with. - Listen Geoff... - Here you go Sir. One, two, three. You can come back for the rest Sir. Okay. Did Crawford tell you what a brute I am to work for? I promise to be the soul of consideration. You haven't told me if you had a good holiday. Oh, fine. Brittany must sound pretty tame after Saigon. You do want to go don't you? Well I am not sure... Here you are Sir. That will be five and six Sir. Geoff could I possibly talk quietly to you. Not now with... Thank you. Could you mind me dropping in this evening after work? Not tonight I'm afraid Helen, you see it's Tracey's first day back at work she will be tired. Besides she probably bought all our dinner things during her lunch time. Oh. You mustn't disappoint Tracey. What is it, what's wrong? Mrs. Lawrence phoned to say she doesn't know when she will be back, is very sorry about dinner but there is cold chicken in the fridge if you fancy that. Oh, thanks very much for telling me. Well there's more than life for you... wives working. Here's frozen food. Good night Sir. Good night. Sorry Sir? Just good night. Ah. It's no use you knowHelen, I'm married. I love Tracey. I couldn't do anything but make you more unhappy. You don't have to tell me that. When you were away I discovered what being more unhappy was like. You wouldn't know what it is to love someone, never touch them, never be touched by them. Do you want to make me more unhappy? The trouble is I do. Very much. If I do go away with you for three weeks, what will happen when we come back? That I'm afraid I'd really start making you more unhappy. Still we would've had three weeks. I could go afterwards, get out of your life. Don't talk like that, I can't bear it. Hello darling. You were very late, Did you have a good day? Hard work, I'm not in training. You are very late, Where have you been? Oh, boring business dinner. I came back, Got your message, Went out to it. Darling. Yes. Don't be too loud getting undressed, I'm awfully tired. I won't disturb you. That's funny... Yes, come in. Telephone Sir. All right constable thank you. Hello, McInnis here. Yes. He did what? How the devil did he get out of there? How far is it? Well tell Davis to put a watch on the old bungalow. No, no, no don't worry about them yet. I'll be up in the morning. I don't care if he's got a sports car, he won't get there ahead of me. It's going to be another terrible scorcher. A drop of water would just keep your flat cool but there it is I've mended it. Thank you so much. The washer is nothing. But you wouldn't expect things to go wrong quite so quick. I left the milk in the fridge, a pint. I'll come with you. I have to be at work in an hour anyway. I'd like some fresh air first. Are you out tonight ma'am? No Mr. Lawrence is out tonight, not me. - Look Helen... - We can't talk about this here. Then let's get out of here. Clear us with the switchboard. Betty, if anyone wants Mr. Lawrence he will be out on the site all day. What all day? Oh, all right thank you. Well Lawrence is out all day and they don't know where. Check all the Crawford building sites, find Lawrence and tell him to ring me. Okay. Better still bring him back with you. Sergeant give me all the reports on those roadblocks around the jail. I want to have one more check. There you go. All right thanks. Give me the Lawrence's new phone number will you? Hmm. He won't know they moved Sir. He shouldn't know. Message from inspector Davis, Mr. Lawrence is not on the town sites and the other one is 15 miles away. All right tell him to check it, thank you... Sergeant. I can't help but enjoy the fact that nobody knows where we are. Look, I wonder when Mrs. Lawrence gets back if you give me a ring. Here's my telephone number. I'll do that Sir. You are a friend of theirs I take it? Yes, a good friend. Operator find out if Mr. Lawrence left his office alone or whether he was with anyone. If so, who. Right come on let's go. Now a long drink and then dinner, yes? Anything you say. Oh, boring business dinner, I came back got your message and went out to it. I won't make demands and I won't make scenes. I love you. You don't know what you're saying. I do know, I'm not a child. It would mean living on the telephone. Never make a plan in case you might come. Spending hours alone with all my real life in utter secret. I believe you must love me. Give that Reade woman another ring, she can't be on the phone all night. Something is wrong somewhere. Yes he's probably hold up, that's why no one has seen him. There is always a possibility that he did get through. I don't like the way everybody is missing in this case. Who could that be? I have absolutely no idea. Look I'll go. Is your wife here? Excuse me Madam. It's taken me the whole day to find you, he's escaped, we have no idea where he is. I've got to get home. She isn't there. - You have any idea where she might be? - No, I haven't. I think we better go together. Tracey, Tracey! Where on earth have you been? What an extraordinary question coming from you. Just tell me one thing, have you had her here? No I have not, Have you been spying on me? Yes I have. I saw your car parked outside your business dinner. Well it might interest you to know that Crawford wants me to go to Saigon on a job and I had to discuss this with Helen. Oh, why is she going with you? Well Crawford wants her to. Don't tell me he's in this too. Look why can't we sit down and I'll explain. I don't want to sit down and I don't want your explanations. I just wish I were dead. You just run away from things you don't like. If you faced up to things you might find them are quite different. There is absolutely nothing left for me to face up to. I didn't think you'd be in today. I'm not, I came to see the old man but he's tied up all morning. Would you take a message for him please Helen? Of course. Would you simply tell him that I can't after all go to Saigon? If he wants me he can find me at home. Job or no job I made up my mind. It is not a shock to me, I knew you would do it. What can I do? I don't know how to bear it. Oh, Helen I'm so sorry it's all my fault. About these pictures, you have to rawlplug and to do that into new plaster you have to drill or you'll have a terrible mess and the pictures down like nine pins. I'll get mine. Shall I make a cup of tea? What's that ma'am? Shall I put the kettle on for some tea? Well if you fancy it, I won't say no. Won't be a tick, Have to get my drill upstairs on the roof with the other things. Stone the crows, now the Lawrence's telephone doesn't work. Ring Lawrence's office will you. Mr. Lawrence's office. Hello. Yes. Right, I'll see you there right away. I must go. Simmonds? Simmonds? The tea is ready Simmonds. He's as deaf as a door mouse. Simmonds? Simmonds? Where are you? Simmonds? Is anybody there? Glad I found you? Aren't you amazed to see me? I've waited for you so many times and now you've been waiting for me? Yeah? I am not amazed. Move, You're in my way. R A T man found bound and injured in woods near A592 bypass. Was attacked Friday night, over. I see. Step on it man we are very late. You just can't get away. We've got all the time in the world. I left my shoes by the bench. You don't need shoes. I need them. You didn't get your shoes, it was a trick. What have you done with the caretaker, is he dead? It doesn't matter. You don't care if people are alive or dead. I only care about you. You'd mind if I died wouldn't you? I can't think of anyone else. You take one step and I shall throw myself down. I mean it. Mrs. Lawrence! You wait there for the husband, Search. Don't you understand? You might have killed someone who has never hurt you and you don't care. You don't even know them. They simply got in your way. That's right. Exactly right. It's not my fault. No, I'm beginning to think it's mine. You can't help what you are. But I haven't tried. Until now. Wait! He doesn't love you. I'm the one, don't be afraid. There's nothing left to be afraid of. Where is she? Not here Sir. The inspector has gone up on the roof. It's locked come on. Tracey! I'm going to lift you up my darling. Let go with your right hand first. Trust me now. Let go with your right hand first, Now! Now the other hand. I can't. Help me Tracey. Trust me just once more. Now. Now. Well done Mr. Lawrence. Do you want to stand my darling? Yes, on my own two feet.
