'DIL RANGEELA' 'Alcohol consumption is injurious to health.' Hey! Stay away! Stay away! I won't forgive you! No! Please stay away! I came to see you! Why did you introduce me to her? She says her pain reduces when she sees you! Darn it! My pain aggravates when I see you. The pain exacerbates! A girl's heart is just like you. You let anyone write their names on it. Then, you erase it neatly without anyone's knowledge. But a guy's heart is like a rock. If he carves a girl's name on his heart even God can't erase it. It is like a rock. I will never forgive you! Never! Why do you need a bucket? Are you going to take a shower? Empty the ocean! Go on. Do it! What? How is it even possible? Are you crazy? A man can confront any kind of problem. But.. - What? ...it is difficult to live when you are heartbroken. Hey! She calls this beach her closest friend. I couldn't tell her anything but I have to teach this beach a lesson. I need to.. - Do you want me to empty the ocean? Yes! Do it! It is impossible to empty a pond and you are talking about emptying the ocean. My story! - Hey! Tell me your story! - Listen to my story! My life used to be very good! "If there's spice, you can eat even tables." "If our speech is apt, we can live right." "If there's spice, you can eat even tables." "If our speech is apt, we can live right." "I cook varieties of food. You just have to taste it." "That's my only passion." "Life's colourful.." "Life's like a sweet dish and nothing more." "Life's colourful.." "If the taste's ruined then no one will eat it." "Life's colourful.." "Life's like a sweet dish and nothing more." "Life's colourful.." "If the taste's ruined no one will eat it." "If there's spice, you can eat even tables." "If our speech is apt we can live right." "Lemon rice, curd rice, Dosa and Vada." "I cook everything. You must taste and tell me." "Pizza, burger, brownie, pasta." "I can cook western, eastern and all other cuisines." "Come on, here we go." "The people we feed shouldn't know how to cook." "It would put me out of business." "It's easy to say, difficult to follow." "If it's tasty, then it's not easy to control." "It's difficult.." "If we don't eat well, then we would fall sick." "If there aren't any hotels, then it's so much trouble." "Life's colourful.." "Life's like a sweet dish and nothing more." "Life's colourful.." "If the taste's ruined no one will eat it." "If there's spice, you can eat even tables." "Swing it on.." "Shut the hell up, I say." "Swing it on.." "Come, let's get dressing." "That's what you get people, fish pepper fry." "If you want sweets, say 'Rabdi Malai'." Pizza, burger and sandwich is American style." 'Bisi Bele bath' is our style." Cheers! After working in so many countries, you came to our place and managed to impress our boss. Well done. Elders ask us not to run after women, land and money as they can make our lives miserable. But if we're lucky to get them, we shouldn't let them go. - Correct. Buddy, I'm glad you are getting married, but be careful. Be more specific or I will beat you to death. I will tell you what he is trying to say. The life of a bachelor is more fun than the life of a married man. If you marry her, you will lose your freedom. Then, what is the solution now? - After you get married you will have to obey her. I suggest, you go to some place and enjoy your bachelor life to the fullest. Suggest a place. - Bangkok! Idiot! Bangkok is a honeymoon destination. Rajasthan. - Should I go there and milk camels? Darn it. Tell me a place. - Buddy. Yes. - Goa! Why Goa? - It is a wonderful place! Like a bull needs more grass a bachelor needs more drinks. You get drinks at a low cost there. Go, enjoy. What shall I tell my boss? Should I teach you how to lie? I see. Okay, sir! Carry on.. - Bye, sir! Excuse me, sir! How was the party last night? How much did you drink? - Sir, I.. Sir, I don't even eat food that has excess oil. Believe me, I feel dizzy even if I pass by a bar. What are you saying? - I'm a very decent boy. My dignity means everything to me. Sir, believe me. I haven't even seen your daughter properly. - Hey! Do you think I drink and make merry with girls? You should have fun at this age. Only then, you can reminiscence about it at my age. Understand? Forget that. Did you talk to your mother about the engagement? Yes, sir. - What did she say? Our family has a custom. We offer prayers to God before doing anything auspicious. Moreover, I have great devotion for God, and respect for elders and women. So, I wish to go on a pilgrimage. You are so silly. - Why, sir? You needn't seek permission to offer prayers or do charity. Is that so? - Yes. Thank you, sir. - Dad! - Yes! Come.. Hi, baby! - Hello. - Priya. Preetham wishes to go to the mountains before marriage! Sir! - I mean he's going on a pilgrimage! No way! I won't let him go anywhere alone! I will go with him! Take her along. Sir, it is wrong to go out together before the wedding. Preetham, times have changed. No matter how modern the world is, I don't go against my ethics. I don't go against my customs. Fantastic! - Dad! Preetham, I won't listen to you. I'm coming with you. That's it. Yes! Correct! Go.. - Sir! The roads to the temple are pretty rough. She will have to walk up the hill. - I will walk. You will have to swim across rivers and lakes. I know how to swim. - Yes, she can. It is a hot region, your skin will get tanned and you will end up looking ugly. Dear, please don't go. - Yes. Okay, Preetham. I'm not coming with you. You carry on. Won't you come? - No. Really? - Really. I thought you would come. O-Okay, I will take your leave. Okay. - Thank you, sir! - Be careful! Bye, baby! Bye, boss! - Happy pilgrimage! "In the sun.." "Get the party rolling, have some fun." "In the sun.." "Let the music throw you up and party nation.." "In the sun.." "Get the party rolling, have some fun." "In the sun.." "Let the music throw you up and rock your party nation." "Tell me your dreams." "Can't you see? And you'll never want to fool me." "Let's get on to the sun, bob!" "You hear the beat" "then you're lying on the shore. Why won't you tell me?" God, I see only foreigners here. I don't see Indians here. Please send someone to keep me company. "Are you ready.." "Slow it down, you can't cheat me." "Let me tell you how I know I want it to be." "Build it up till you let go." "Jump up and say hey, no.." "Jump it up." "Pump it up." "Slow it down, you can't cheat me." "Let me tell you how I know I want it to be." "Build it up till you let go." "Jump up and say hey, no.." "Jump it up." "Pump it up." Hello, ma'am! Don't answer the call. It's a wonderful song. Hello! Hello, Sister! Hello.. I told you not to receive the call because the network here is bad. Which movie is the song from? Hey, girl! Won't you talk to me? I asked you because you're from Karnataka. Which film is it? 'Mungaru Male'. - What's your name? Believe it or not I stood in the queue all day long and bought tickets. Someone told me that the hero and heroine separate in the end. So, I sold the ticket in black and went back home. I don't like films with a tragic end. I didn't appear for my exams as I didn't want to separate the cap from the pen. Promise! Believe me. Say something. People will think I'm mad if they see me talking to myself. Can you please.. - All right, I won't talk. If I talk, you might get impressed with me and ask me out for coffee. I will not bother you. Excuse me. Who said I will get impressed by you? You will never see me again. Hello, ma'am! God decides whether we should meet or not! Oh, no! Hello, Sir! - Son-in-law! How is the trip? I finished prayers at one temple, I'm now going towards the other. I hear the bells. You must be engrossed in prayers. Yes, you are absolutely right! Please pray for me too. I will be happy only if you are happy. I will first pray for you, then your daughter, and then for myself. You are really bold! What? - I mean, gold. I will call you later. I can't hear anything! I will call you after I have the offerings. Okay! Enjoy.. - Bye.. Wow! What is this instrument? Bell. - Bell? Yes. - Can you give me your bell? No, I can't give this! This is my personal bell. Well, I'll give you dollars! No.. I can't give it to you! Come to Bangalore, you will find different types of bells. Big bells? - You'll find big, small, medium! You will find bells of different sizes. - Okay. - Okay. She is eyeing my bell. Hey! Are you from Mumbai? - No.. I am from Mysore. I've come to Goa for the first time. Sir, your beer. - Okay. - Yes. The dollar rate has increased, but their dress size didn't. Sir, what do you want to eat? Do you have red millet ball? You don't, right? - Right. Bring Chapatti and Dal. - Okay, sir. This is for you, sir. Are you from Karnataka? - Yes! I'm Tony Brinjal from Muddenahalli, birth place of Vishveshwarya. Please take a seat! I am so glad to meet you. What do you do? Are you a waiter? I am the owner of this hotel. - Superb! You didn't forget red millet balls even after coming to Goa. A farmer must not forget his farms and people of Karnataka shouldn't forget red millet balls. - Correct. Please have it. How is the red millet ball? - Very tasty. Who are you? Why have you come to Goa? Sir, my name is Preetham. I've done a hotel management course. I joined as a chef in a hotel. The owner of the hotel was impressed with me and my cooking and requested me to marry his daughter. Sir, I don't let go of any opportunity. So, I accepted the offer as soon as he asked me. I am like you too. My story is similar to yours. I joined this hotel as a dishwasher. I managed to woo the owner's daughter and married her. I converted to Christianity. Did the owner's daughter fall in love with you? I don't believe you. - Say what you like. I may look ugly now. Earlier, when I used to run down the shore wearing shorts, the girls would go crazy seeing me. Just try to imagine. Enough! Come back! - Okay.. Sir, you are an experienced man. Please teach me how to act after marriage. A man has to lie a lot after marriage. Sir, it's like you are teaching a bold actress how to expose. I am an expert liar. Tell me something else. You should wife whatever she asks for right away. They are like alarm clocks. Once they start ringing you should calm them down. If not, you can't sleep. Tell me more. I will take you to a party tonight. What kind of a party is that? It is a game which fulfils the desires of needy men. Disgusting! - No! I am getting married. I don't need another woman. Though cricketer Sachin is expert in batting, he practices daily. Same with us. Practice makes a man perfect. I think you have been practicing a lot. I am like a thief who can open many locks with just one key. Isn't there anyone in Goa? There is one below our house. Won't your wife find out? The bee gets attracted to flowers and not to the tree. That's my inspiration. That's fantastic, sir.. - Concentrate! Sir, I will take your leave. - Wait. Call me if you need anything in Goa. If you need women, give me a missed call. Sir, you are a man of desires. Be careful. Goa can be a dangerous place. You will regret if you aren't careful. Okay, sir! Bye! Wonderful! Oh, God, how did you manage to put so much salt into the sea? You are great I say! - Hello! Excuse me! - Who is it? What are you doing here? You said you'll never meet me again. It is He who decides our fate. Am I right? I have been trying to start the scooter. Couldn't you help me? If I had offered you my help you would have abused me thinking I'm following you from yesterday. Stop talking. Please help me start the scooter. - Right away. I look handsome, don't I? What is your name? Khushi. - Khushi.. Ms. Khushi, I will tell you something. Listen to me carefully. My parents taught me how to cook. They didn't teach me how to fix a vehicle. No matter how hard I try, I won't be able to fix it. Because I don't know anything about vehicles. Why do you boast about yourself so much? Here's what you should do. Just 1.5 kilometres from here.. Will I find a garage? - No. You will find an old man sitting in a shop and smoking. Ask him for a garage and he will guide you. Don't you feel ashamed to tell a girl to tow a vehicle? Ms. Khushi, if I offer help, you'll think I'm trying to impress you. I asked you to tow the scooter and you're insulting me. Oh, my God! These girls I tell you! They are impossible.. All right. What do we do now? I can't help you tow the scooter. Do this. Get on my vehicle. I will take you to all the places you want to visit. You are very smart. Men will be men. I will come, but on one condition. I will ride the vehicle and you sit at the back. No problem. It doesn't really matter who rides the vehicle. Instead of using face creams for glowing skin drink tender coconut water. Take it. Show me your ID card. They've put up boards everywhere warning us to stay away from strangers. I have come so far with you. What if you molest me? My life will be ruined. I better be careful. Show me your ID card. Hello! A conversation should always be two-sided. Why are you quiet? Please say something. What is it? I see you more than I see local buses in Goa. Are you from Goa? I'm from Mysore. Mysore? - Yes. Mysore! Same pinch! I'm from Mysore too! Though we hail from the same city, we were destined to meet in Goa. What a miracle! You are interacting with me as if we are childhood friends. Please stay quiet. If we find someone from Karnataka in a different state we are bound to get close to that person. Do you feel the same? Me too. Drink it. In Goa, you must drink tender coconut during the day and liquor during the night. Why did you come to Goa? My sister lives here. I come here whenever I get bored. Do you come here when you get bored? - Yes. You should find a boyfriend, you can punch him when bored. I don't have a boyfriend. I guessed so! I realised you don't have a boyfriend when I saw you stranded on the road on your bike with a flat tyre. Hello! Don't try to lure me because I'm handsome. I'm already engaged. I'm marrying a rich girl. I will lead a luxurious life with her money. Don't you love her? Ma'am, I am the best lover in the world. The meaning of love is to trust, have faith and to stand by one another during difficult times. I have all the good qualities. Look, what I said is true. My fiancee is calling. Hi, baby! Where are you? I'm sitting before the idol of a Goddess. What? - I have come to a temple. The veneration is done. I'm waiting for the oblation. Don't eat junk food and drink only mineral water. Okay.. - Are you missing me, baby? Obviously. - Okay, baby. Hello! Hello.. Why are you walking away? If I stay with you any longer, I will become a liar too. One gains confidence by lying. By the way, what's your problem if I lie to my fiancee? You lied to your fiancee when I'm standing right next to you. Oh, my God. I can't believe it. Why not? Why shouldn't I lie if you are with me? I will do what I like. Hello! Khushi, you've come with me, so I should give you a ride back. You are left with no option. Stop here.. Khushi, is this your house? No, I live close by. I will take a walk. That's the problem with girls. You don't trust the boy you've been with all day! But you give your contact number to mobile recharge centres and your house address to the pizza delivery boys. Why do you do this? Hello! They are not as dangerous as you are. I will never show you my house. - Hey.. Khushi, go away.. I won't come to your house even if you invite me. I promise! I have self-respect too. Ma'am.. Ma'am! Who is it? - Greetings! I'm Preetham, Khushi's classmate. I dropped her home last evening. She is sleeping, I will wake her up. No.. Let's not disturb her. The route was quite confusing. I asked people in your locality for your address and they guided me here. I got confused as I dropped her at the end of the street. Sit down. Please sit, ma'am. Your walls have nice colours. Khushi told me you prepare tasty Masala Vadas. That would be my husband, not me. Then it must be Masala Dosa. No, it's my husband who prepares even that very well. I see. Then, it must be chicken Masala'. No, I am a vegetarian. What tasty dish do you cook then? My husband cooks, I only help him. So, you don't know to cook. Why did Khushi lie to me? - I don't know. Ma'am, I will teach you to cook. Where is the kitchen? - What? The kitchen? - On the left. Being a woman, you don't know to cook. I will teach you. This is 'Bisi Bele Bath'. If you add onions from North Karnataka, it'll be tastier. You hate non-vegetarian food. If you add fish instead of onion, it becomes Fish Pulao. If you add goat meat, it becomes Mutton Pulao. If you add chicken, it becomes Chicken Pulao. Did you understand? - Yes. Khushi doesn't understand anything. She is dumb. She often used to get beaten up by the teacher at school. I used to see her getting beaten up. Hey, what are you doing here? She is surprised! She is surprised! This is how she is. At school, when I used to step out of the toilet she'd ask me what I was doing there. What could I say? Khushi, I made 'Bisi Bele Bath'. I have taught her too. Have it. I will meet you at the same place, okay? Have it for breakfast too. Khushi, he is a wonderful cook. - Hey.. - Bye.. Sister, why did you allow him inside the house? Obviously, he's your classmate. What? Is he my classmate? I met him only yesterday. But he gave you a ride back home yesterday, right? Idiot! If an auto driver drops me, will you invite him too? Did he lie to me? - Yes. How much is this? - Rs. 500. Rs. 500? - Yes. - Make it Rs. 50. No.. - I will buy two. No, definitely.. - Please.. - Mister! You barged into my house, don't you have any common sense? Common sense? Did I barge into your bathroom? I just came to your living room. You said you will never come into my house but you barged into my house and cooked food too. Don't you feel ashamed? Believe me. I didn't want to come. I was drunk last night and didn't have dinner. God came in my dreams and said 'Dear, I'm sad as you didn't have dinner last night'. I said, 'I didn't like the food in Goa' and He said, 'My dear, don't worry.' 'Go to Khushi's sister's house and eat Karnataka food.' I said, 'I can't go as I have sworn by you.' So God said, 'I don't care.' 'You have been breaking promises from childhood, I'm used to it.' 'So, go and have your food'. Hence, the moral of the story is why do you mind, when God Himself doesn't mind? You are so disgusting. You met my sister for the first time and lied to her. I wonder how much you would've lied to your fiancee to woo her. Ms. Khushi, ask me what my love story is directly. Why are you beating around the bush? I will tell you how we fell in love with each other. I decked myself up and attended an interview. What are you doing? Well, I was trying to see your file. If you'd asked me, I would've shown it to you myself. Here. Please don't attend the interview. You will surely get the job. Please do me a favour. Go back. Why should I help you? I am in deep sorrow and I need your help. If that is so, I will take everyone and go away. You will be the only candidate here and you'll get the job. Tell me about your sorrow. Thank God! On the day of 'Ugadi', my parents and I sat down for lunch. My mother was feeding my father. My father fell in love with my mother and bit her hand. My mother got angry and bit my father's hand. My father got angry and bit my mother's cheek. My mother should've applied ointment and sat quietly but she didn't do that. She bit my father's nose. My father got angry again, and bit her ear. They are battling for their lives now. Their condition is critical. I need money to save them. I need this job for the money. People usually make merry during festivals but your parents almost killed each other. Preetham, it's your turn. Okay, I will do something. - Thank you. Hello, sir! What? - Yes. We learn about taste when a mother feeds us food cooked by her. That taste is unbeatable. Wow.. "A mother is everything." - God! - "She would never change." "No matter what happens." Stop it, Dad! - Superb! He talks really well. Dad, don't be silly. We can't hire people who talk well. I don't just talk. I also make delicious food which leaves people speechless. - Oh! What style of food is your specialty? Whatever I do is special. - Tell me the menu. 'Mangalore Buns.' 'Mysore Pak'. Appetizers from Gauripalya. Davanagere's 'Benne Dosa'. Hubli's 'Jolada Roti', Belgaum's 'Kunda'. Tamil Nadu's 'Pongal'. Kerala's 'Appam'. Andhra's Biryani. And Karnataka special 'Uppsaaru, Soppsaaru, Bassaaru!' I also make red millet balls round like a ball and soft like cotton. Ours is an International Star Hotel. Yes.. - It's not some local hotel. Mexican tacos, Italian pasta, pizza, Chinese fried rice, noodles Japanese Sushi and Sashimi and American Continental Food! What do you want? They say, something is better than nothing. We must be fortunate to have such an efficient candidate. Dad, please don't get carried away by him. But he is so talented. Think about it. Don't let him go. He will save our business from getting ruined. Okay. You will be on training for three months. Then, we will make you a permanent employee. Yes, three months training. But I have a condition. - What is it? There's a guy named Giri sitting outside. I want him as my assistant. Done. Do you want us to hire more people? Dad! - Please work with us. Goodbye to Brindavan Group! - Sir? I mean, welcome to Brindavan Group! - Thank you, sir. Prepare for tomorrow's conference, okay? - Okay, sir. Hello, sir. - Preetham. Why did you send for me? Drink? - No, thanks. I don't drink. What do you think about my daughter? Sir, your daughter.. I'm grateful to your daughter for giving me a job. - Fantastic! I will tell you a secret. Our hotel has started doing well only after you joined. I am happy because of you. My daughter gave you a job, what can you do for her? Sir? - I mean, will you do me a favour? What do you mean? - Will you marry her? Sir, I think you are drunk. Sir, you are asking me so casually. No, I'm serious. My daughter rejected all the marriage proposals. I don't know why, when I talk about you I see a smile on her face. Her eyes twinkle. Will you marry her? It's not just mine, it is my daughter's wish too. She loves you. Sir, will you give me a minute? All right. - Excuse me. Mom, you always said that I am destined to become a rich man. Mom, the time has come now.. Preethu, if you accept the marriage proposal you will be rich! Buddy, you are so lucky! I must say, you are very fortunate. Preetham.. - Sir? You want to accept the marriage proposal but you are wondering how to say it. Am I right? No, sir. I am confused. I don't know what to say. I am.. - You are in the toilet, so don't worry. Sir, I want to talk to my mother about it. She should agree first.. Even I hid myself in the toilet when I went to meet the girl. If a guy hides himself in the toilet, it means that he agrees. Sir, that's not.. - I'll share the good news to my daughter. Okay? - Sir.. Hereafter, you are the broker of this hotel. Sir? - I mean, you're the owner. Come on, hug me. Hug me.. - Sir.. - Hug me.. Okay, bye! Good luck. - Sir.. This is my decent love story. Oh, my.. Are you marrying a girl for her money? People have different reasons to marry. One evaluates character and gets married. Others see beauty. In the same way, I am marrying her for money. If I am wrong, then, all of them are wrong. How can you marry someone you don't love? I will fall in love with her after the wedding. Hello, boss! - How come I hear bells ringing at this hour? Boss, I've come to a special place. The specialty of this place is that you can hear the sound of bells ringing 24 hours. If not, there'll be a thunderstorm. Baby, isn't it a strange belief? - Yes, boss. I felt the same way. I realised that the bells are very powerful. Is it? - Shall I call you later? You know what, after you finish your work.. I'll call you tomorrow. - Okay, boss. Bye, good night. I lied to her. Poor girl. Why do you lie to her? If I meet her, I'll reveal the truth to her. You'll never meet her, so, you can't tell her. Who taught you to lie? There was a VJ for a show named 'Comedy Time' on Udaya TV. I learnt it from him. - Oh, God. I shall leave. Goodbye. Oh, God. Khushi, why are you standing here? Death is not a solution to everything. If God had plans to kill you He would've made you an animal and not a beautiful girl. Don't! Leave my hand! I'm haven't come here to die. I come here whenever I feel low. I love the beach. It's my best friend. Best friend? Is it this place? Khushi? It is so cold here. Why are you standing here? I don't know why, but whenever I come here I strongly believe that my parents are watching me. Your parents? I don't see anyone here. They are no more. I'm sorry. My parents died in the Tsunami, two years ago. My parents always took me wherever they went but for the first time, they left me alone. They never returned. I had a friend named Vicky who took good care of me. I trusted him blindly. Later, I learnt that he has cheated many innocent girls like me. I come here when I feel low. Khushi, change your name to 'Novu', meaning sadness. It would suit you. Why are you crying over a stupid guy? When you smile you get a dimple. Hundreds of boys will fall for it. Come on, cheer up. Why are you crying? Come on, let's go.. "This life" "is so colourful.." "Show the happy beat." "Sit on the beach right in the morning." "Hold a bottle of beer in your hand." "Smoke cigarettes, one after the other." "Just come over to Goa." "This life" "is so colourful.." "Spend money at the casino." "Don't miss out on the massages." "But wear your sunglasses without fail." "Don't stop flirting with these beauties." "Cool and spicy Goa." "Everyone go crazy in Goa." "Boozing up in Goa." "Let's meet some chicks in Goa." "Life's a sport, play it well." "Even if you're bored, don't rest." "Don't feel bad or get emotional." "Be sportive in happiness and sorrow." "Be happy, never be with a sad face." "Roam on the beaches without worry." "If you don't, then life isn't fun." "Don't think too much, just come to Goa." "Sit on the beach right in the morning." "Hold a bottle of beer in your hand." "Smoke cigarettes, one after the other." "Just come over to Goa." "Don't be angry, say yes to friendship." "Life's all about love and friendship." "Life's like liquor spreading joy" "all around, smile, my friend." "Drink as much as you want to." "Forget all restrictions!" "Enjoy with all these beauties." "But wait for the right companion." "Wear your shorts and come over to Goa." "Sit on the beach right in the morning." "Hold a bottle of beer in your hand." "Smoke cigarettes, one after the other." "Just come over to Goa." Preetham, stop.. Stop! - Why, Khushi? What's the matter? Is someone following you? Who is it? I will kill you! Hello? What did you just say? I said, I'm will kill the person following you in Konkani. Preetham, don't go overboard. Will you do as I say? Do you want me to shift Goa to Mysore? Should I shift the beach to your house? That's not required. Hey! - Come, sleep here. Do you want me to sleep on the road? People gossip when they see a couple sitting in the park. You're calling me to sleep next to you, on the road, at this hour. Please come. - No way.. Hey! Come on! Mahatma Gandhi had said that if a girl walks on the street at midnight in our country it would mean that we are independent. Girls are now sleeping on the road at midnight. Are you happy, now? What next? Do you know? Whenever I feel very happy I like to sleep like this, look up in the sky and talk to it. Why did you make me sleep on the road, with you? We could have chatted while standing somewhere. Preetham! Tell me. I'm really very happy and that's because of you! I never thought that I could forget that idiot Vicky. But from the moment you told me, I don't know what happened to me. I don't miss him anymore. Preetham, once again, I thank you so much. It's okay. People who face problems with a smile aren't troubled even by God. That's my policy. Okay.. It's your turn now. What do you feel now? I.. - Yes. It's so late the bar will be closed. Where will I get the booze now? Oh, God! You always talk about drinks. It is like slow poison and it will kill you. Hello, I don't wish to die so soon. I want to die slowly. You are laughing. I've never fell down on the road, even when I was drunk. And you made me sleep on the road without even getting drunk. Come, let's go. - Okay. I don't know if I'll remember anything about Goa. But I will never forget the experience of sleeping on the road looking up in the sky and talking to it. Oh, look there. Pubs in Goa are open all day and night like medical stores. I want to get drunk. What about you? No, I don't drink. - A little.. No. - Okay, I'll drink your share too. Come. Thank you. Hey baby, come back. - Just a minute. Go and come back. Hello. - Hello. Drink well. Looking very nice. - Vicky? - Thank you. Vicky? You just said you forgot him and now you are chanting his name. The person I told you I have forgotten is right here. Richard. - Thanks. - You're welcome. Here. - Thank you. That guy? Is he Vicky? - Yes. You smell good. God, what is this? You don't give us boons but you manage to shock us from time to time. Great! His sight makes me recollect our old times. Let's go from here. How far can you go? 100 kilometres or 200 kilometres? No matter where you go, the memories will follow you. You have to learn to face them. Thank you. Why are you drinking water? Change your drink. - That's okay. Will you do as I ask? - What? Go and slap him on the face. - What? Preetham, what are you saying? Khushi, people who don't fear, die once but a coward dies every moment. If you want to close the chapter of Vicky once and for all go and slap him now. Vent out your anger. Khushi, even I can't bear to see him. Why are you quiet? You should slap him so hard that he will think twice before deceiving a girl. You should slap him. Go, Khushi. No. - Come on, Khushi. You can do it! Come on, go. Khushi, he cheated on you, didn't he? - Yes. Aren't you angry? - Yes. - You are angry! Then, vent out your anger on him. Go and slap him. Okay? Come on, go.. You can do it Khushi. Go! Go. "Are you ready?" "Slow it down, you can't cheat me." "Let me tell you how I know I want it to be." "Build it up till you let go." "Jump up and say hey, no.." "Jump it up." "Pump it up." "Slow it down, you can't cheat me." "Let me tell you how I know I want it to be." "Build it up till you let go." "Jump up and say hey, no.." You're so cool! Khushi? Do you think I am sad because you ditched me? What do you think of yourself? You loafer! Khushi? - Dirty fellow! You think I'll be alone if you leave me? Dog! Khushi, what are you saying? - Do you think girls are toys? You swine! - Khushi! Scoundrel! - What are you saying? Idiot! Rascal! If I ever see you with any other girl.. Listen to me. - You'll have to carry a birth certificate to prove that you are a boy. Khushi, mind your language. - Do you understand? You.. Idiot. Preetham! I did it! - Very good. I am so happy today! Yes, man! I feel like getting drunk. Come, let's go. - Yes. Come. - Yes, let's go. - Yes.. Goa is called a drinkers' paradise. But I couldn't find any booze. I saw it in the room next door. So, I stole it. Many guys get drunk because of a girl. I am lucky that I am drinking with a girl. Have it.. Preetham, I'm drinking for the first time. Will I be fine? No problem. Drink. Booze is like an extended family. You feel strange when they arrive but once you gel with them, you begin to feel good. Drink it up in one gulp. That's Shakeela. - What? I mean, Tequila. Here, suck on the lemon. You'll feel good. Okay? I'll drink it now. Have one more, you'll feel much better. I hope it won't harm me. No, drink it. Come on.. It's all good. Khushi, I thought I was a fast drinker but you are faster than me, even though it's your first time. Preetham, shall I tell you the truth? You shouldn't tell anyone. - No way. My friend and I used to steal her father's booze and get drunk. You are opening up slowly. This means, you are getting high. Khushi, I didn't know you were so bold. You slapped him real hard. Listen, my child.. What? She's drunk. I have to bear everything now. Ms. Khushi, tell me. You are a fool. Lord Hanuman was powerful. He didn't carry the mountain every day to prove it. No, right? He carried the mountain only to save Lakshman. Everything has a specific time. A modern girl is talking about Ramayana. Tequila, you are great! Preetham.. - Yes? I'm feeling very energetic. Come, let's go thrash Vicky. Oh, no! Khushi, he is already in shock as you slapped him on the face. We'll go later. No.. Come, Preetham, let's go. I have to slap him. Come! Oh, no! Please Khushi.. Shall we do this? Consider me to be Vicky and do whatever you feel like. Okay? Oh, God! Let me hide the bottle. I'm very happy today. Thank you so much! Welcome.. - Preetham, I feel like giving you a gift. A gift? - But what should I gift you.. Ring. This is my favourite ring. No, thanks. - Preetham, take this. Preetham, can I have one more glass, please? Khushi, it got over. The guy took it back. When? - When you slapped me. I want more. It got over. Come, I'll drop you home. No, I'm very happy today. Let's do something. Do what? Dance! - Dance? The hotel is closed. There's no music. I have my mobile phone with me. Come, let's dance.. "When you come closer to me, my heart starts racing." "Tell me.." "Please tell me." "You're now in my dreams calling out to me.." "earnestly.." "Why a heart that does not sway to your love tunes?" "Tell me why." "Tell me. Please tell me." Stop the music.. Why? What happened? - Play another song.. Let's not play this song now. - Please.. - Play some peppy music. Pop music? Okay. - Please.. "Diva.." "Diva.." "Don't you know.. I'm very sexy" "Don't you know.. I'm very sexy" "Groove with the beat with your hands and feet." "Follow the music and move along with it." "I'm the queen of the night." "I am the fantasy of all your dreams." "You're the queen of the night." "Sing a song tonight." "Don't you know.." Why! - "Don't you know.." "Don't you know, I'm very sexy." - Dance! "Don't you know.. I'm very sexy" - Hey.. Wait! Hello? - Hi, baby. Good morning. Good morning, boss. - Didn't you leave? I'll be there by evening. Please come soon. I'm missing you a lot. Yes, boss. - Bye. - Bye. Hello? Ms. Khushi.. Why is she sleeping here? Ma'am.. Hello! Hi! Good morning! Oh, no! - No.. - Mother! No, nothing happened.. Don't worry.. Did I sleep in this room all night? You were sleeping beside me. - No.. No, don't worry.. - Have you lost it? I was sleeping with you last night. And you're telling me not to worry! All is well.. Khushi, I used to do yoga in my childhood. I have great self-control. Okay? Nothing happened.. Okay? I think so.. We met in Goa and went to places. Especially, we were drunk and fell asleep here. Forget about everything.. Let's go our ways. Okay? You shouldn't talk to me even if you meet me somewhere. I offered a ride back to your house last night. You didn't listen to me. You said that you want to dance and enjoy. You danced to a song and then slept next to me. - Hey! You slept beside me and now you are questioning me! Anyways, bye. Goodbye! Shit! Hi, ma'am. - Priya? Ma'am, how many times did I tell you? Why don't you hire a maid? I like taking care of the chores. Moreover, it's difficult to find a maid. Okay, where's Preetham? He hasn't even eaten anything after he returned. Ma'am, he was your son till now, but now, he is my baby. Go to his room. - Okay. Baby.. Baby.. What happened? Baby, what happened? - Boss, is it you? God! - I had a nightmare. Don't be silly. Anyway, how was your trip? It was good. - Okay. You haven't unpacked your luggage. You don't have common sense. Put all this for wash. I thought I'll do it later. You don't think about cleanliness. Baby.. What is this? - A top. Whose? - Yours. What? - I bought this for you. A gift? This is a used top! Used? - Yes! No.. Stupid! The shopkeeper cheated me. Shops con us by selling used clothes. Which shop? Where? - On my way back from the temple I thought I should buy something for you and went to the shop where you regularly buy your clothes. He's sold me a used top! Stupid! Bloody fools! Give me the phone! Hello? - Don't you have common sense? Who are you? - Don't you feel ashamed? Why are you shouting at me? My boyfriend bought a top from your shop and you sold him a used one. What? A used top from our shop? - Yes. A used top? - One second. Hello, not yours. Here.. Pal. - Yes? I think a guy got caught trying to woo two girls by gifting the same top. What do we do? Give her an excuse and save yourself. Baby, I will teach him a lesson. - Don't spare him. Guys must help other guys in trouble. I'll manage. You can go. Ma'am. - What? I'm really sorry, ma'am. I enquired from my staff members. Even they've received the same kind of complaints. Our staff girls wanted to entice rich boys so they've worn the clothes. Why don't you fire them? Just kick them out! Sorry, ma'am. I'm really sorry, ma'am. I'm really sorry.. - It's okay. It's okay.. - The manager told me this is a top which was worn by one of the sales girls. 'I thought only soldiers help strangers in distress.' 'This manager has managed the situation so well.' 'I am obliged. Thanks.' Do you know what I thought? Baby, I thought you lied to me that you were going to the temple and spent time with a girl. Boss, if I was in your place I would've thought the same. Baby, your phone is ringing. Hello? - Hello, it's me, Tony. Putte Gowda. - Gowda? Tell me, Mr. Gowda. - I'm not Gowda. I'm the horse of Goa.. - Mr. Gowda, tell me. I've come to Bangalore. I have arranged for a big party. Please come. Have you come to Bangalore to buy eggplants? Eggplant? I'm talking about a party. Are you talking about aubergines? Aubergines? I'm talking about the party. Is it tonight? - Now you are talking. Yes, it will be fun! Mr. Gowda, I'm with my girlfriend. I'll call you later. Okay. Mr. Gowda, I told you about my boss and his daughter, right? She's my fiancee. Now I know why you are blabbering. Baby, who is it? - It is my uncle, Putte Gowda. The government is felicitating him for his eggplant harvest. Oh, that's nice. Let me wish him. Hello. I hear you won an award for the harvest. Congratulations! - Thanks. I'll supply eggplants for your wedding. Instead of giving coconuts as return gifts to the guests we will give eggplants to everyone. Okay? Baby, what nonsense is he talking? Talk to him. Yes, Mr. Gowda! - We'll party tonight. Party hard. - Okay, Mr. Gowda. - Okay. - Bye. Baby, father has organised a party at the farm house. He wants to introduce you to everyone. Get ready and come. - Okay. Hi, future Son-in-law! - Hello, sir. - Welcome! Baby, wait for me. - Sorry.. Come.. Welcome to my small farmhouse. - Oh.. Sir, is this a small farmhouse? If you turn this into a stadium, even Chris Gayle can't hit a six. You are always funny. This is my Dubai partner, Rasagulla. I mean, Abdulla. - Oh.. - Hi. Nice to meet you. - Abdulla, please. How was your trip? - Good, sir. You've lost weight. Did you circumambulate the temple many times? Not only that, I performed all the prayers and did everything. One has to do all that. Even I did everything to have a baby girl. I mean, I performed the veneration. My close friend has been eagerly waiting to meet you. Why is he so eager? - Hey! This is why I like you. Come! - Oh, God. We came from the village together. I settled here and he settled somewhere else. - I see. Where are you, Mante.. You bloody fool! Don't call me Mante. Call me Tony D'costa. Understand? Okay. - Okay. He is my future son-in-law. He's turned his back. His back is beautiful. Show me your face. Come on. - Come on. Come on. Sir, I don't let go of any opportunity. I accepted the offer as soon as he asked me. Hello, sir! - He respects elders and takes their blessings. Come on, get up. - Yes, he will.. Get up. Bloody fool. I thought you were cheating someone else but you are cheating my friend. I will cancel your engagement. I'm Tony D'costa! Sir. - Yes? Can I embrace you, Mr. Mante? Yes, go ahead. Hug him.. He's very friendly.. Mr. Mante! Hey, Tony! I don't care if you call off my engagement as I'm still young. Tony, think about yourself. What did you tell me in Goa? I am like a thief. I open many locks with one key. Tipswamy! - Mante Swamy! Siddalinga Swamy! - Mante Swamy! You are so lucky. He is precious.. "Come to Mante Swamy.." - He's my close friend, Mante. Baby, come, I'll introduce you to my grandma. Take him.. My best friend is here. Oh, no, ma'am.. Khushi? Grandma, Khushi, he's my boyfriend. Priya, where is he? Where did he go? - What? Baby! One second, I'll get him. - Okay. Baby! Where did you go? What is she doing here? Oh, my God. Mr. Tony! - Preethu.. I compromised with you, then why are you hounding me? Tony, I didn't come looking for you. I will end it all. I'll call you before I sleep next to my wife. Please don't reveal the truth to my wife. Tony, that's not the point. I.. Goa is a humid city. Try to understand. Should I fall to your feet? Tony, listen to me.. That's not the point. Please, Preetham. Baby! What's going on here.. "This girl is.." - Stop it! What are you doing? What's going on? Sir was teaching me Goan style dance for the evening party. Sir, stop it! Don't you have any sense? I have to introduce him to others. Please stop it. Come. Stop wasting time! Goan style! Shame! Baby! Don't talk to Mr. Tony. What were you doing? It was so disgusting. Yuck! Hi, Priya. - Hi, Khushi. He is my baby, Preetham. Priya, what's wrong with you? Where is he? Well, he was here. Where did he go? Oh God, what's wrong with you? Wait, you know what? I'll just get him back. Okay? Okay. - Baby! We were taught in school to always tell the truth. I should've followed that. Baby! - Yes, boss! What are you doing in the bathroom? What else would one do in a bathroom? Okay, come out in five minutes. Everyone is waiting for you. Boss, I'm coming.. God, You are great. Please save me this one time. I will never lie again. Sir, call him. We are getting late. Son-in-law! - Sir? My daughter's friends are here to meet you. Come out. Sir, I am naked. Shall I come out? - You are so naughty! Wear your clothes and come out. What's the matter? I can hear strange sounds from inside. Sir, my stomach is hurting. He's got slow motion. - What? I mean, loose motion. Go, have dinner. - What? I mean, go and eat food. Son-in-law! - Sir? - He's crazy. Shall I call the doctor? - Forget the doctor. There's no water here. Please check. Shall I give you liquor? - Sir, how can I wash up? Okay.. I will arrange for it. What do I do? Hi, guys. - Hi. - Hi. Are you guys comfortable? - Yes. Priya, where's your boyfriend? You said that you'll introduce him to us. Where is he? He's got an upset stomach. He isn't coming out of the toilet. I think he drank too much. No way. He doesn't drink or smoke, you know? Oh! He has just returned from a pilgrimage. Hence, it must be due to food poisoning. Priya.. It's very surprising that a guy is so pious in this generations. You know what, you'll be more surprised. I'll get him here and introduce him to you. Sure, go. - You guys carry on. Okay? - Okay. Order whatever you want. - Yes, sure. - Thanks. - We will. He has come out! - You! - Mom! Oh, no! Even the children are scaring me. He has built such a big bathroom. It wouldn't have hurt to build a small window. I could have escaped from here. What should I do? Baby, that's a bathroom, not a bedroom. You've been sitting inside, since morning. Come out. Everyone left. Boss, did everyone leave? Yes, everyone left. Did everyone leave? Yes, everyone left. Come out! Yes! Oh! Boss, I couldn't meet anyone. - Yes. Boss, my stomach is clear now. I'll come out in five minutes. Okay, come soon! - Oh, God! God, I know why You punished me. It's because I lied by mentioning your name. Hereafter, I will never lie. Okay? At last! Finally! The party was ruined because of you. Everyone left. - Is it? Sorry, boss.. Everything has cleared now, I feel light like a feather.. Baby, you just said you're alright. Where are you going? Khushi, this is my boyfriend, Preetham. Oh! So, are you Preetham? - Greetings. Priya talks a lot about you. She told me that you don't smoke or drink. She said that you don't even look at girls. She said that you don't lie. It's not like that. She just boasted about me. She lied to you. Come on, it's difficult to get a guy like this these days. I'm so lucky, Khushi. Very lucky. Right, Preetham? I think so. Okay, baby, you know what? We'll go drop Khushi and I'll drop you after that. Okay? Come on, guys. Let's go. - Drop.. What should I do now? I'm trapped. Oh, no.. Baby! - Coming. Do come here often, Khushi. - Yes, sure. Why not? Mom, sorry, I forgot. I'll come right away. Sorry, Mom. - What's the matter? I had completely forgotten about it. Aunt Rakshita had arranged a veneration at home. My mom's there. I told her I would pick her up. I forgot about it completely. Let's all go and pick her up. - Oh, no! We can't go. Many women of our colony are with my mother. We can't pick them all up in our car. No way! I can't come along. Take the other car and carry on, okay? You won't mind, right? - Not at all. I'll drop her, carry on. Okay? - Okay. Bye. - Bye. - Come. Boss, don't feel offended. - Don't bother. It's okay. 'Prince Bar and Restaurant' Pal, the bar is closed. This isn't fair. You can't close up so soon. Please open. Are you heartbroken? Yes, I'm heartbroken. Come inside. - Thank you, boss. They are my friends. Don't worry. Here. - Enough. Cheers! - Cheers! You are so well dressed. Why did you come to a local bar? This is where I belong. I'm only wearing expensive clothes. Well said. Pal, do you want to hear about Shah Jahan's sad story? Ask him.. What is it? Tell us. - Tell us about your sad story. I tried to escape from there but I got caught in the end. I'm very tense. I'm worried that she may reveal the truth to her. Why are you crying? Boss, we love girls so much. Sometimes, we even lie to them to make them happy. One lie for our happiness leads to terrible consequences. That was a touchy dialogue. - Boss? That was a touchy.. Play a song. - "One shouldn't fall in love.." Come on, start. "You're a passenger from a strange land." - Wow! "You're a passenger from a strange land." Not this. - Why? What? - This is not the song I want to hear now. Which song do you wish to hear? "That's right!" "Check the beat now." "First it's 30 then it's 60" "later it's 90 and then we roll-over." "I am a player, but my girlfriend's nice." "Have a betel leaf as I'm a cheat." "We jump over the wall even if the gate's opened." "We ring the doorbell even if the door's opened." "We light the candle even if there's electricity." "We sleep well even if our girlfriend's angry" "because we would have had a drink." "First it's 30, then it's 60" "later it's 90 and then we roll-over." "You then just roll-over.." "Who hasn't heard about your tales of lying?" "Even enemies are scared of your lies." "The reason for all this are your lies." "We shouldn't become weak by speaking the truth." "We shouldn't get caught when we lie." "How's it possible to fall in love without lies?" "Falsehood is my God!" "If you mix two brands of liquor" "you're sure to be found in a ditch at night." "If you lie to a woman" "you will be tormented." "My life's ruined." "First it's 30. - 30! Then it's 60. 60!" "Later it's 90 then we roll-over." "You then just roll-over.." "Give us a pose. That's right!" "That's right" "Booze it up." "Why should there be a reason to drink?" "If we're happy then drink a little, if we're sad then a lot." "It's fashionable for women to drink." "But if we drink, then it's called poison." "Let me tell you something, my friend.." "However drunk you are, just go home." Giri. - Why are you late? How is boss' mood? - She's furious. I'm doomed.. What? - I lost my job. Oh! - She'll call off the wedding. Oh! - You should work without me. - Oh, no! Be careful. Who suggested that I should go to Goa? I was the one who told you. You are an idiot. Boss! Preetham, how dare you? How could you do this? Actually.. - Don't you have common sense? Actually.. - Look! I don't want an explanation. What you did was wrong! No, boss, actually.. Do you even care for me? Why, boss? - Why? You had a stomach ache, so I called you many times to ask about your health. Why did you switch off your phone? Boss! Are you angry with me because my phone was switched off? Why are you laughing like this? Boss, I took some herbal medicine and went to bed. I switched off my phone so that I'm not disturbed. You should've told me. Boss, forget about that. Last night, did you drop your friend Khushi safely to her house? - Yes, why? Did she say anything about me? Do you know what she said? She said, you are a good guy. Did she really say that? Boss, don't lie to me. Not only that, she said that we are made for each other. She was all praises for you. Is it? - Yes. So nice of her. I couldn't talk to her properly. I thought she would be upset with me. Excuse me, ma'am. Yes? - Some guests are waiting for you. Yes, I'll be there in a minute. - Okay, ma'am. - Okay, Preetham. I'll just get back. Okay? - Okay, boss.. Thank God.. I'm saved... I have to thank Khushi. Thank you, Khushi.. Khushi.. Ma'am.. - Don't give me these. You've still kept the old stock. Go and get the new stock. - Hi! Go! - Okay, ma'am. I will do it. Hi. Hi, Khushi. - Who are you? Don't you recognise me? People guess that it may rain just by glancing at the clouds. People can guess the time by looking at the sun. But no one can predict about girls. Girls are very unpredictable. Well said, sir! You said the right thing. From now, you're my boss. - Leave me. Are you heartbroken? Why are you getting emotional? - Boss? Khushi.. Hello, Khushi! You spoke to me so much in Goa, why aren't you talking to me now? Excuse me. It was you who told me not to talk to you even if we meet again. You told me to forget about everything that happened in Goa. I don't remember what I said, why are you taking it so seriously? How did you know I was here? A phone number is enough to learn details about anyone. Anyway, if you want to talk to the world, you can use a mike. It is said, if you want to say something to many at once you should tell a girl and then advise her not to tell anyone. Thanks for keeping my secret and not revealing it to her. Thank you very much. My truth won't set the two of you apart because you've managed to come closer to her by lying. What's the use of telling her? If you had told her the truth, she would've barbecued me. Girls believe in stories more than reality. I wouldn't have forgotten my pain all my life. But you helped me forget it during the time we spent in Goa. I'm sure you will keep her happy. That's why, I didn't tell her the truth. You are the only one who has understood me, after my mother. Preetham, I have a request. No one can lead a life by lying. Correct. I know. But I have a request too. What is it? In the next birth, you should be born as a millionaire's daughter. I will look for you, fight for you and get you. Promise. I won't lie. I swear. I swear by you. Why are you swearing by me? - I give you my word. Okay? Anyway, thank you very much.. Once again, thank you very much. Are you slicing mutton.. - Hi, baby! Hello, boss. - I have some good news. Our engagement date is fixed. Boss! Superb! I'll kill you. She's talking about our engagement. - Superb, boss! Thank you, boss.. You should thank the mother if the child is beautiful. You shouldn't thank the midwife. Sir, I don't get you. I fixed the engagement date and you are thanking her. Sir, I am so happy that I feel like hugging and kissing you. But I am controlling myself because she is standing here. You don't feel shy to romance her in front of me but you are shy to romance me in front of her. Come on, kick me. - Sir, what do you mean? I mean, kiss me. Come on. - Dad! The engagement date is approaching and we have lots of shopping to do. Yes. - Dad, I'm taking him. Come on, baby. - Okay, enjoy! Boss, superb! I'll go with them. - Stop! No, do your work. Sir, can I help you? I need a coat for my engagement. Show me the black one. Sir, here's the black colour coat. Try this. This is a fast moving item in our showroom. - I see. Yes, sir. It fits you well. Sir, you look like a hero wearing this. I have to look good at the engagement. Okay, I'll call you back! You've got good taste. - Thank you. - It fits me, right? - Yes, sir. Wow! Baby! Who selected this coat for you? - Ma'am, I selected it. Idiot, what nonsense! Are you out of your mind? Who appointed you? Let's go, baby. Take it off. I'll select one for you. - Okay, boss.. Pal. - Sir? Please don't feel bad. - Sir, we are used to this. My wife scolds me daily. You'll experience it once you get married. It's okay, sir. Boss? - Baby, how's this dress? Awesome, right? - Awesome! Superb! I selected this coat for you. The idiotic salesman was showing you a black colour coat. Black is my favourite colour.. - But this is my favourite colour. Go and wear it! Okay? - Yes. I will try this. - Yes. Hereafter, grey is my favourite colour. Baby! - Yes? Today is Khushi's birthday. I forgot to wish her. Try calling her from my phone. Let's wish her. Did you try calling her? - I'm trying. 'The number you're calling is switched off'. - What happened? 'Please try after sometime.' It is switched off. - Okay. She is always like this. She is very moody. Does anyone switch off their phone on their birthday? How do we wish her? Baby, how is this dress? Superb. - We look good together, don't we? - Yes. This is a little tight for me. Shall we take a bigger size? No, this size looks good. You should buy this. Okay? Okay. - Fine. Come on, we'll pay. Sir, it is not good. I know. - Okay, sir. Hi, Khushi. Happy birthday. I found your address though you had switched off your mobile. Who's at home? Is your sister at home? Ma'am.. Hi. - Hi. How are you? - I'm good. How are you? - Superb. I came to wish her. Khushi, is he your friend? No! Friends ask for a party if they come home. But if a guy comes looking and gives the girl a bouquet I'm sure he's her boyfriend. He's given red roses to her. Correct, Grandma. He's Vicky. Grandpa, do you remember Vikram? He is Vicky. Oh, is he Vicky? - Yes. Smart fellow. When I see them, I remember the days of our courtship. Vicky, come with me. You haven't seen our house, right? Are you happy? Before our marriage, whenever you used to look at me you used to feel shy like this. - Stop it. Grandpa! - There are so many children? Doesn't anyone follow family planning in this house? They are children from our neighbourhood. Grandpa likes children. I thought they were your grandpa's children. - Oh, no! Sorry, Preetham, I introduced you as Vikram. My grandparents don't know about Khushi's breakup. They will feel bad if they learn about it. I will tell them when the time is right. They haven't seen Vicky. If you don't mind will you please act like Vicky? It's okay, ma'am. Till date, I thought my happiness means everything. Now, I have an opportunity to make others happy. I'll act, don't worry. - Thank you, Preetham. The food is very tasty! Both the sisters always fought with each other and so they haven't learnt to cook till date. My darling always cooks food. - Should I serve you? No, thanks. I am full. You should eat well at this age. I won't listen. You should eat. I'll serve more. - Enough. I don't want more.. Grandma, why are you forcing him? Oh, you are so concerned about him. Be careful. What are you looking at? Serve me some food. You need to watch your cholesterol level at this age. You must take care of your health. Don't eat too much. Get it? Why should I watch my health at this age? Does she expect me to become the hero of an action film? I want to eat in order to impress you. Please serve me. I will serve just a little. Excuse me. Your grandma is such a good cook. Long throw! Try taking the ball from him. Goal! You've chosen a nice guy. pass it here. - It's not enough for him to become your husband he should become one of us. I can see that quality in him. Sagar! Come on! Get up.. Grandpa, one can fall in love after marriage. But there is no surety that lovers will end up marrying each other. Both of you are very lucky in that case. In our generation, love happens very fast. Love happened very slowly in your generation, right? Did you hear what he said? Our lips would get sore twice in a week. You'll lose your mind if I tell you how I proposed to her. How did you propose, Grandpa? I booked an aircraft and took her into the sky. I proposed to her amidst the clouds. It was so thrilling, she accepted my proposal. Wow! Ma'am, is it true? I didn't accept because it was thrilling. I thought he would throw me out, if I refused. I will throw you out now. - Leave me! If we didn't have to follow the customs I would've consummated our marriage amidst the clouds. But that was not possible. - Why, sir? Tell us how you proposed to Khushi. I.. How did you know that I proposed to her first? I'm experienced, dear. Girls may be ahead in queue, but when it comes to proposing boys are still ahead. Sir, I.. I didn't take her amidst the clouds. It's a very simple story. We met each other. I proposed while talking and she accepted. Very good. Come on, show it. Khushi! Just a second.. Stay there.. Go ahead. - Sir.. Grandpa, is it necessary? - Really? Keep quiet. He teased us saying our generation was slow. You are slower than us. I've forgotten how I proposed. I haven't forgotten it though I'm 75 years old. You are only 25 years old, how can you forget? Don't act foolish. Come on, get up. Go! Go on. - Okay. Watch the fun. Grandpa, what are you doing? Listen.. - Grandpa, keep quiet. Go on. Before I met you my heart was black and white. After I met you, my heart has become colourful. Khushi, when I saw you for the first time my heart skipped a beat. What? - Nothing. When you turned and looked at me, it started beating again. Khushi, when you look at me I forget myself. I might die if you smile like that. Khushi more than the pain that I can't have you I'm sad that I am unable to forget you. Khushi many guys would've gone crazy seeing the dimple on your cheeks. But only one guy won and that is me. Open the door to your heart and allow me inside. I will keep you happy forever, throughout my life. I love you, Khushi. I really love you. I love you too, Preetham. Very good. Well done. Superb! Khushi, what's the matter? - Nothing. Fantastic! - Sir! I must say you proposed to her better than I did. I just said it. Should I propose to her once again? Please go ahead.. Khushi. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I proposed to you before them. Your grandpa challenged me. I proposed to you to make it look natural. I'm sorry. I hope you didn't get offended. Actually, I thought I would apologise to you. I acted like you did. Today I'm feeling very happy to have spent time with your family. Can I tell you something? They were happy because of you. Didn't you feel happy? Did I say that? Why do you assume things? Then, now, or in the future I will never misunderstand you. You are not what you project to be. Thank God. I thought you must have misunderstood me. Thank you very much. Khushi, I feel like doing something. What? I want to look up in the sky and talk just the way you do, when you're happy. I don't know what happened today but I miss my dad very much. Fifteen years ago my father was a businessman. He got along with his friends and started a business by taking a loan. His friends used to address my father as 'Brother' and my mother as 'Sister-in-law'. One day my father died in an accident. All those partners who were close to him ran away without repaying the loan. My mother repaid the loan with great difficulty. Only then I realised that relationships are meaningless when compared to money. That day, I decided to earn money. I started running after money and I haven't stopped since. Khushi, I don't know why now I feel like stopping. If not I feel I will lose something. I'm scared. Sorry. I'm narrating my sad story on your birthday. I'm sorry. Now I realise that there's so much pain behind your smile. It is raining. Get up! Come.. - Preetham! What is it? Shall we get drenched in the rain? I think you've cast a magic spell on me. I feel like listening to everything you say. 'The subscriber you are calling is switched off.' Boss, did you call me? - Where is Preetham? Boss, how will I know when you don't know about him? Why has he switched off his phone? His battery must be dead. What? - Yes. One has to charge the phone and the charger is in the kitchen. Tell him to call me as soon as he switches on his phone. Okay? Okay, boss. Get lost! Ma'am, I heard you wanted a pain reliever balm. Is it for sir? - No, it's for me. My legs are paining. Give that to me. I will apply it for you. Where does it pain? Here. - I will apply it. Ma'am, I've never seen a happy family like yours. I'm happy to be with you. Is it? When Khushi was young besides me, no one could pacify her. After her parents' death she cried inconsolably. Even I couldn't console her. You brought a smile to her face. You are really great. I don't know how long we will live but you should take care of her after we are gone. Will you take care of her? I will. Thanks. Vicky. - Yes. - Thanks for coming. Only the three of us would feel bored. Okay, son. Good luck. God bless you. Bye, Vicky. The way you are bidding farewell to me it looks like you don't want me to come here again. Vicky, you are a family member now. Visit us often. - I will surely come. That's good. - I will be happy if you do. Why are we standing here? Maybe they want to talk to each other. Go ahead. Let's go.. - Come on. Preetham, thank you. It's okay. I can't tell you to visit home often like grandma and grandpa did. You can't come even if I do. Anyway happy married life, Preetham. Thank you. Bye, Khushi. Preethu, how are you? Are you all right? Mom, why do you look worried? What's the matter? Priya shouted at me saying that you switched off your phone on your engagement day. Just call her first. Did Priya shout at you? Go and get ready. - Mom.. Get ready. They must be waiting. - Did she shout at you? Go and get ready. - Mom! Why do you look sullen? Nothing, Mom. I'm all right. Mom. I think they are rich. We can loot them. Are you blind? - Sorry, sir. Sir, I didn't do it intentionally. I will pay you for it. - What? Did you do it unintentionally? - I'm telling you. Preethu! - Mom! "When things go wrong, he'll set it right." "He'll take in hand to show the light." "Stop right there and turn it up!" - Hey! Come on, give me the money. Don't act smart with us. Preethu.. - Mother, are you all right? I'm fine, Son. Preethu, why did you fight with them? Mom, I can't bear to see you in pain. Let's go, Mom. Come. Boss, what's the matter? What happened to you? Nothing, Giri. - Boss. They're waiting for you. Please come. He will be here, don't worry. - Preetham and his mother are here. He is here. Come.. Welcome.. Preetham, what happened? Sir.. - Dad! - Wait! Preetham, where were you? Don't you remember that it's our engagement today? You switched off your phone even today. Is this the way to dress up? The waiters look better than you. Shame on you, Preetham. - Dear, cool down.. Please.. - Dad, stay out of this! Preetham, it is pointless to tell you. I have to tell your mother! Bloody middle class mentality. Hey! Keep quiet. If you say anything about my mother, I won't spare you. Actually.. - Sir. I don't wish to go ahead with this engagement. Sir, your daughter doesn't want a guy to marry she just wants an employee who listens to her. - Listen.. Sir. I made a mistake lying to you that I love your daughter. If I marry her without telling you the truth it would be cheating. Sir, I always looked at life differently. I lied to you that I'm going on a pilgrimage and went to Goa instead. I met Khushi there. Khushi is your daughter's friend. I thought money is the only important thing in life. She made me realise that love is superior. Sir, she could've told the truth and cancelled the engagement. But she didn't do that. She wants everyone to be happy. Sir I don't know if she loves me or not but I love Khushi. Sir. I'm telling you all this now. I'm very sorry, sir. I felt like telling you. Life is about making others happy. Sir, it is not about throwing your weight around. Please forgive me, sir. What the hell! What are you talking? - Priya! Shut up! Do whatever makes you happy. Dad? - Thank you, sir. Good luck. Boss. Mom, I.. One needs courage to tell someone that you like them. But according to me one needs to be more courageous to refuse someone. Many people have ruined their lives as they didn't have the courage. I'm very happy with your decision. Do whatever makes you happy. Mom! Thank you, Mom.. Boss. Khushi, we shall leave. - Okay. Okay, I will see you, bye. - Sure. Convey my regards to your sister. Sure. Okay. We shall leave. - Okay, ma'am. God bless you. Mom, we have to invite many others. We can't miss anyone.. - Hi. Mr. Vicky? You were with Khushi in the pub, right? Yes, it was me. Thanks a lot, boss. I realised my mistake after what happened at the pub. I apologised to her and she forgave me. I'm getting married. Everything is sorted and I'm getting married. Khushi has forgiven me and she is happy. We will be happy if you come. Sure. Will you give this ring to Khushi? Boss, why are you giving a gift already? She left it with me in Goa by mistake. You can give it to her yourself. No, it's better if you give it to her. Oh! - You are getting married. I'll call her later. Okay. Boss, before I forget I'll take your address from Khushi and come to invite you. Okay. - Thank you. - Thank you.. Mante! - Yes? Shall I start walk straight ahead? No, don't take such a decision. I made some arrangements. Everything will be all right. Mante, you talk about partying even after listening to my story. It is foolishness to call romance weakness. It's foolish to think that a romantic guy thinks only dirty all the time. Look there! Mante, why did you call her here? I called her here because you said you were upset. Mante, I'm not upset because of this girl. It's because of some other girl. She took a flight to come here. Compromise with her. Mante, I will thrash you! - Preetham! She's calling you.. Go.. Mante, things that you do.. Boss, I already apologised to you. Why did you come here? Preetham, I have a surprise for you. Look there. Khushi. Khushi, why did you come here? I don't understand. Preetham, I didn't give this ring to you to give it to someone else. Khushi, I didn't give it to a stranger. I gave to your fiance, Vicky. Fiance? It's not my problem if you assume things. Vicky had come to apologise to me and invite me for his wedding. Did Vicky come to apologise to you and invite you for his wedding? - Yes. I misunderstood.. Khushi, I was sad, so I got drunk. I can't understand anything. Please.. I'm.. Preetham, will you accept my love and keep me happy for the rest of my life. "You are my happiness." "My dreams are happy." I love you so much. I love you too, Khushi.
