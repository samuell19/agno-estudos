- I'll get it! Finally. Thank you. It's perfect. - How's it going out here? - Almost done. Just have to attach some rings to Jupiter here, paint the red spots, do a little work on the storms at the poles. Overkill? - Maybe just a smidge. - I just want to make sure my diorama is accurate. You know, it's 25% of my grade in AP Astronomy. - That's next year. - I know. But all this effort will pay off when I impress everyone at the Semester at Sea program with my astronavigation skills. - Lookin' great sweetie. - Thanks Mom. I'm just finishing up so I can go back to packing for my semester at sea. You know, on the ship they have four state-of-the-art research labs, open 24 hours a day, unlimited access to supplies and equipment, an SBE45 thermosalinograph, and in-vivo chlorophyll fluorometer. - So I've mentioned that before? In 72 hours, while you guys are on your annual medical mission, I'm going to be on one of the most advanced research vessels in existence, studying fluid dynamics, and ocean waves. - Every girls' dream. - Okay, I'd better go pack. - Our own little Madame Curie. - Hopefully with a happier ending. - Okay, so you get to Sydney at 10:00 a.m. and we get to New Delhi at 6:30, but there's a four and a half hour time difference so. - So I'll be totally fine and I'll call you as soon as I land. Don't worry, Mom. - Oh, I'm gonna miss you so much. - It's only a few months. It'll go by really fast. - Now, If a giant squid attaches itself to the boat, scream and run for the life rafts. - Thanks, Doctor Bailey. I live for these little lifesaving nuggets of wisdom. - I love ya, Kitten Britches. - Flight 1823 to New Delhi, now boarding, International Gate I-50. - Gotta go, Babe. Remember, have fun. - You're sure you're okay? - Me? I'm better than okay. Doin' okay! Doin' okay. - You all right? - I'm sorry. Are you doing the semester at sea? I'm Cory. Have they said anything about the thermosalinograph or the fluorometers? Is there like a sign up sheet? I want to make sure I get plenty of lab time. I have this hypothesis about the effects of decreasing salinity on wave peaks and biodiversity. I know what you're thinking, and admittedly, it's pretty radical, but there is some anecdotal evidence from, from some research vessels in the Arctic Circle, wait up! Thank you. Did you see a girl about yay high, glasses, ponytail, cute, but sort of nerdy? - You mean besides yourself? - I wonder where she is? I guess she'll have to catch the next one. ♪ Hey look up at the sun ♪ ♪ 'Cause it's shining for you ♪ ♪ It's a beautiful day ♪ ♪ It's a beautiful day ♪ ♪ 'Cause when you're smiling ♪ ♪ You'll move mountains and be ♪ ♪ Somewhere much better if you only believe ♪ ♪ It's a beautiful day ♪ ♪ It's a beautiful day ♪ - Chlorophyll fluorometer. - Hey, we're here. - Thank you. I wouldn't want to miss the boat. - Yeah, so we'll see you on the pitch? Boat? - Pitch? What was that? Where's the ship? - What ship? - What ship? The ship. Where's the dock? - Same place it's always been, I hope, about 60 kilometers south. - No, no, no no no no. - Are you okay? - I'm supposed to be at the Harold Academy. - You're in the right place. - Semester at sea? - Oh, you're not in the right place. This is the Soccer Academy. See, there's the Soccer Academy and Harold Arts Academy and Harold Humanities Academy, and the Semester at Sea Program. - What? No! Okay, okay, calm down. - I'll try. - If the ship is 60 kilometers away, then I can catch a ride at an average speed of 100 kilometers per hour, I can make it to the ship by-- It left two hours ago. I'm supposed to be with the dolphins. - The boys' practice team is called the Orcas. Does that help? - I see, I see. The Semester at Sea? I see. Oh, I see. Okay, all right, thank you. See ya. - What did they say? - Look it's not great. The ship for the Semester at Sea has already departed the dock. - But they can turn around, right? I mean, it's a ship, it can float this direction. - Wouldn't that be a treat, but the research schedule wouldn't allow for any delays, I'm afraid. - Then I'll go to them. I could get a speedboat, or-- - Well they're just a little bit too far out already, but are you ready for the great news? - The school owns a blimp with rappelling ropes? - Okay, you're gonna need to let that go. But, because the Semester at Sea is one of our Harold Academy sister programs, we can transfer your registration and tuition here to the Soccer Academy. - No, please there has to be a way. - Cory, we spoke to your parents. They're on another continent, your ship's in the open ocean and your options are limited. So, let's just try and make the best of it, okay? - But I don't play soccer. - Correction, you didn't play soccer. Now, here is your schedule, your campus map, and your dorm assignment, and everything else there, and you can check in straight away. That's the spirit, now tryouts are tomorrow. Remember, the first rule of soccer is-- - You can't touch the ball with your hands? - Well that's not what I was gonna say, but all right yeah, let's go with that. Okay, I'll see you on the field. I am so inspirational. - So who was that girl you were talking to earlier? - I don't know. I guess she's supposed to be doing Semester at Sea, but missed her boat and ended up here instead. - Now's not the time to start getting distracted. - Good point. - The scout's gonna be looking at us this year. - They're gonna be looking at everyone Lewis, that's what scouts do, they scout. - I'm just saying, we have a big opportunity this year. Professional club scouts, the national leagues, this is our shot to show them what we can do. Just stay focused. The world is your oyster. - I'm allergic to shellfish, so? - The world is your burrito. - Come on, let's take some shots. - On the net and in life, right? Right? - So this isn't ideal, but would Jane Goodall let this stop her? She would not. A little peace, a little quiet, and a good night's sleep, and I'll be ready to take on tomorrow. - They did not. - They definitely did. - Wait, who told you they broke up? - I'm so sorry, are you okay? - It's not your fault, it's just the day I'm having. - So, you're moving in? - They said our fourth roommate was dropping out. This is awesome. - Yeah, awesome. - That's Charlotte, the world's most organized 16 year old, and Adelle, fashionista extraordinaire. And I am, Janessa. - Janessa loves to dance, no matter how awkward the occasion. - Nice to meet you all, I'm Cory. - Are you American? - Yeah, I'm from Los Angeles. - Do you know Ryan Gosling? - No. - What about Jennifer Lawrence? My girl, J-Law. - Settle down J-dawg. All right Cory, let's get you settled. - So, are we all in this room? - Isn't it great? - Yeah, and lucky for you, you ended up in the best room at Harold Soccer Academy. Charlotte can get you unpacked. - Oh, I can do that. - Charlotte lives for the chance to organize anything, even if it's just a wardrobe. - Plus, it'll protect you from Janessa's lucky socks, lurking in the wardrobe. - At this point, those things could play soccer without you. - But you're not supposed to wash lucky socks, that's the whole point of lucky socks, dude. - Okay, let's do this. - Adelle, you can help her figure out a first day outfit. - Really, I can-- - Looks a little on the wintry side. - I'm supposed to be in the middle of the ocean. - That's deep, how do you feel about sleeves? - Now that's all sorted. Anything else? - Just one thing, I've never played soccer in my life. - Oh. - You mean, you've never really played before? - Really, not ever. But I did spend some time on Wikipedia last night. So there's two teams of eleven players. - Seven, we play sides of seven for camp, squads of eight. - And graded according to ability. - And potential. I've been working my potential all summer. - Here we are, locker number 83. - Yeah, that looks about right. - My locker's right next to yours, so I can help out if you have any trouble finding your classes. - Yep, that looks like you. - Impressive, senior advanced chemistry? You're smart. I couldn't do that. - Professor Oster is one of the toughest teachers here. - I know! I was so excited to hear that we get to take classes along with our soccer. At least that's one thing I look forward to. - Oh yeah, that's right up there with visiting the dentist and mystery meat day in the cafeteria, which reminder, is today. - Oh, come on. What's more exciting than lunch meat with a secret? America, you're still here! - You guys know each other? - Yeah, we go way back. Remember that time you fell asleep on the bus? Classic you. - He was there yesterday to witness the greatest humiliation and saddest moment of my young life. - So this is Sea Girl? - Cory. Wait, are people calling me Sea Girl? - No, no way. I just mentioned you to Lewis is all. Oh, right. This is Lewis, and I'm Oliver. - Uh oh, incoming. - What are you doing? We're supposed to be warming up. Gotta work hard if you don't want to end up on a loser practice team. Why are you talking to Sea Girl? - Okay, this has been great. I'll see you around? - I'll be here. Who, what, and why was that? - That was the unnatural phenomenon known as "Edie." - And we do mean phenomenon. - She learned to dribble the day she learned to walk. - I hear Pele is her uncle. - And Ronaldo is her other uncle. - And I hear you all talking a bunch of nonsense. She's not that good. Come on, I'll walk you to chemistry. So, what's up with you and Oliver? - What do you mean? - I mean, speaking of Advanced Chemistry. - What? Oh stop. - He's one of the best players in the school. Everyone thinks he and Edie are dating, but they've just been friends since they were kids. - I'm not listening. - Oh yeah sure. But if you were, you'd hear me saying that he's the cute Australian soccer player, and you're the school's mysterious new American. - I'm Sea Girl. - So, you just need some rebranding. - See, if you get here early enough, you get the whole field to yourself. - So Edie, what have you been up to since last summer? - School, my parents were on location in New Zealand for most of the year. - Must be great to have such fantastic parents. How about you, Oliver? - Well. - What? - My dad lost his job. It's been kind of tough. - That's awful, mate. - Yeah, I had to get a job to pay for camp. It's my last chance to play. - What? - Well, I'm gonna have to be working when I get back. I'm not gonna have time. - What are you talking about? You're one of the best players at the best soccer camp in Australia. - So? - So, there are going to be scouts watching you. If you really focus, you could get picked up by a pro league. - We can help you? - You think so? - Like I said mate, this is your year. The world is your burrito. - Oyster. - He's allergic to shellfish, so. - Guys are you look at Leah? - Yes. I'm pretty sure she went for the E Team last year. - Do you reckon we'll be getting into the E Team this year? - I really wanted to. - No glasses! - I really only need them for reading. - Well, you look great. - You made it. - Are you ready for tryouts? - Was Thomson's plum pudding model of atomic architecture correct? No. - You really don't play sports at all, do you? - Nope, it's always been me and my books. If it were up to me, it would stay that way. - Okay, stop. Look, if you'd read the gigantic sign on your bus, you'd be swimming with the humpbacks right now. - Common misconception, humpbacks migrate south. - Okay snooze. The point is, you're not swimming with the whales. You're here, with the coolest roommates on Earth. Why don't you make the most of it? Break out of your shell, and try something different. Come on, loosen up a little. - Well, cardiovascular activity has been linked to the generation of new neurons in the brain. - That's the spirit! I think. - You've gotta follow through. ♪ Let's go one and all let me show you how ♪ ♪ In the know layin' low don't want to blow it now ♪ ♪ Let's go in the know let me show you how ♪ - Charlotte. ♪ Kick it kick it kick it and let it bounce ♪ ♪ Kick it let it bounce bounce bounce bounce ♪ ♪ Kick it come on ♪ ♪ Kick it ♪ ♪ Come on kick it ♪ ♪ Let's go one and all let me show you how ♪ ♪ In the know layin' low don't want to blow it now ♪ ♪ Let's go in the know let me show you how ♪ - Okay, switch up now please. ♪ Kick it let it bounce ♪ ♪ Kick it let it bounce bounce bounce bounce ♪ ♪ Kick it let it bounce ♪ ♪ Kick it let it bounce bounce bounce bounce ♪ ♪ Kick it let it bounce ♪ ♪ Let it bounce ♪ ♪ Kick it kick it kick it let it bounce ♪ ♪ Kick it let it bounce bounce bounce bounce ♪ ♪ Kick it let it bounce ♪ ♪ Kick it let it bounce bounce bounce bounce ♪ ♪ Kick it ♪ - Nice kick. - That was a nice warmup to the season. - That was warmup? - The first day's always hardest, it - I hurt in muscles I didn't even know I had. - Come on, we'll just get you back to the room. - Hey, they're posting the teams! - Yes, E Team for life! You've improved a lot since last year, Janessa. Too bad it wasn't enough. - Well, the good news is that we are all on the same team. Hashtag WOTB! - Okay, but what's WOTB? - Worst of the best. We only made the practice team, again. - I thought you guys looked great out there today. - Yeah, and that's why we're the worst of the best. - It's an elite soccer camp but somebody's got to be at the bottom of the list. - And at good old Harold Academy, that's us. - Not for long. - What do you mean? - Didn't you guys hear? They're talking about cutting the practice team next year. - Wait, what? - So anyone who's on the practice this year-- - Probably won't even get in next year. - Welcome to the team. - Wait, what, wait, they put me on a team? - Well yeah, what did you think was gonna happen? - They'd realize I'm so bad at sports, they'd buy that blimp with rappelling ropes? - Oh, Edie is captain of the E team again. - And that's special or something? - Well, E stands for excellence. - It's the top team at the school. My dad was on the boys' E Team when he came here. - And my brother was captain. - Are they all like Edie? - Nobody's as special as queen Edie. - Edie's parents are big TV stars over here. - She thinks she's so much better than all of us, and that we should all worship her or something. - Just steer clear of her and you'll be fine. - Hi, Mom and Dad. I tried to call but I couldn't get through. Guess you're deep in the jungle. Try not to get eaten by a giant snake. So, have you had a chance to figure out how to get me out of here? They put me on a team. Like a soccer team. To play soccer. Can you believe that? Anyways, please call me soon with news. Please. Please, please, please! Love, Cory. - Sorry to interrupt, I just left my book in here after class. - No worries. I'm just working on a demonstration of atomic emission and luminescence. It's for my science presentation. - You're working on that already? - Well, it's a big part of the grade. I wanted to get a head start. - Is that a pickle? - That's a keen observation. See, by sending voltage through a pickle, the electrons from sodium atoms present in the pickle are excited to a higher energy state and then relaxed, emitting their energy as visible yellow light, which is interesting to precisely no one in this room besides myself. - Don't, I love pickles. - Oliver, what's taking you so long? - Cory's just teaching me how to make a glow-in-the-dark pickle. - Actually, I'm studying atomic emission and luminescence. - Okay, well try not to nerd so hard you hurt yourself. - Are you done? - Got it. - Then let's go. - Nice goggles. - What was that about? - I know, that new girl is so weird. It's like-- - Not her, you. You seem to have some sort of thing against her. - I just don't buy her act, that's all. - What act? - A random American girl shows up at the best development camp in Australia but can't even play. - It was a mistake. - That's another thing. She's a super nerd who can't even read the sign on a bus. - Come on. - Oliver, you need to stay focused on impressing the scouts this year. You can't get distracted, especially by her. What's so great about Sea Girl? - Well, free pickles. And they glow in the dark. - What are we doing on the beach? - Beats me. - Maybe my boat is coming back to get me! Or maybe not. So, can I ask a question? - Sure, shoot. - Why do our uniforms feel like they're leftovers from 1995? - Because they're leftovers from 1995. - The E Team gets all the new equipment, so the practice team gets stuck with the castoffs. - Good morning, practice team. I thought today we would run some drills on the beach. - Excuse me, Coach. - Yeah. Doesn't the physics of running and kicking in the sand just make everything that much harder? - Yep, yeah the physics does that. And if you can kick a goal on the beach, then you can kick a goal on the field, so let's line up and count off into teams. - How about this? Do you like this? - Cory, Cory beach boogie. - Cory. - Seriously Cory. - Thermosalinograph! Oliver, hi! So how long have you been standing there? Probably long enough. Well, we were just-- - Just doing the Cory Cory Beach Boogie? Yeah, that's my favorite. - So, what are you doing here? - Well actually we were just gonna go for a swim. - We're going swimming. What's up? - Want to join us? - Actually I have a chemistry presentation-- - That she's already spent four hours practicing for. We are in. - But I didn't bring my bathing suit. - Come on! - I don't really like swimming. - But you're Sea Girl. - That's a bad idea. - Sounds like you had a rough year, man. - Yeah, and the worst part is, I know things are still hard at home, and I'm not there and I can't do anything to help. - What do your parents say? - They say I shouldn't worry, I should focus on what I can control, and play my best. That's what you can do to help, man. Play your best here so you can get picked up, become a huge soccer star, and buy me and your parents mansions, next to yours in like, Glamarama. Now all you need to do is show 'em what you can do. - That's easier said than done. - You know, most things are buddy. Most things are. Want to head back? - No, I think I'm just gonna take a minute. - I'll be right back. - Hey, I just remembered. - Everything okay? - Are you kidding? At a beach bonfire, okay is the bare minimum you can be. I just wanted to get away for a bit, be alone with my thoughts. - Oh sorry, I'll leave. - No no no, stay. I'm all out of thoughts. Are you having fun? - For the first time since I've been here, I think I might be. - Ah, that's not true, I saw you with that glowing pickle. You guys were having a blast. - Well, it's true, as a general rule, I do find science to be easier company than people. - Oh sorry, I'll leave. - No stay, I'm all out of science. - So, how's the soccer portion of soccer camp treating you? - That's not quite so great. But I did make a pass today. - That's awesome. - Yeah, I'm thinking national team by next month. - Get lost again, Sea Girl? - We were just catching some air. - I've seen you play goalie, Cory. You should focus on catching the ball. - Okay, you need a marshmallow. - What's her problem? - That's the beauty of Edie. She doesn't have any problems. She's just that way. - All right, give it all you got, let's go. Great work, beautiful. Crowd go wild. Janessa, well done. Charlotte, you're up. Come on, hustle, let's move girls. Okay, let's go, kick it like you mean it. Yes, almost great, you gotta work some footwork. Okay, Cory. Let's go, let's go, let's go. Okay Cory, let's bring it home. Uh, yep. Just to the other home with the goal in it. Now, that's time up. Okay girls, I will see you back here tomorrow, thank you. - Tomorrow maybe, but not next year. - Come on Charlotte, let's not think like that. Let's just make the most of the time we have here. - Can I please have my bag? - What bag? - Don't play cute. Give me my bag. - I seriously don't know what you're talking about. - I don't have time for your games right now, Edie, okay? - You know what, I do feel something. Is this what you're looking for? Is this your bag? Oops. - Thanks. - Can you tell her? - I don't want to tell her. - You tell her. - I'm not gonna tell her. - If you guys keep looking at each other like that, your eyes are gonna bulge out of your heads. - Fine. Are you gonna tell us what happened between you and Edie today? - Edie and I just had a little misunderstanding regarding my gear bag. No biggie. - Edie might beg to differ. - You do realize she's gonna make it her mission in life to get you back, right? - I'm not afraid of Edie. - I'm not saying you should be scared, just maybe don't travel through the halls alone. - Or leave any of your food unattended. - Or fall asleep for the next couple of nights, or ever again. - Cory should switch to a secret locker. - Come on guys, she's a high school girl. What's she gonna do? - Are you sure this is a good idea? I mean, if you need a snack, I have some Twisties in my bag. - Can you please be quiet? - Good idea. - So much for covert. - What are we looking for? - This. - That's the craving that you're willing to risk arrest and expulsion for? A cucumber? - Come on, let's go. - Wait. - What are you going? - We can't just take it without paying for it. They'll know what it's for, right? Hey wait. - You've left your Powerpoint at home? - Well, yeah. - Why don't you go say hi? - What? - If you want to be part of the loser crew, don't let me get in the way. - We've got a couple of minutes before class starts, you sure? - Go. - Hey, so you ready to show the world a fluorescent pickle? - It's actually a phosphorescent pickle. See, with a fluorescent object, the light stops as soon as the energy source stops. But with phosphorescence, the release of light is delayed. So it's actually a different process at a subatomic level. - Who knew there was so much science involved in lighting a vegetable? - Okay, everyone please, take your seats. I'm looking forward to our first presentation. Cory, to the front. - My presentation today is about atomic emission and luminescence. During the pickling process, a pickle absorbs electrolytes, primarily sodium chloride. So, due to the ionic nature of the compound, sodium chloride will luminesce when hit with an electrical current. I don't understand. - Miss Bailey, I expect my students to take these presentations seriously, and come prepared. This is very disappointing. - But I did. - Please, take your seat. - Looks like you've gotten yourself into quite the pickle. - Now, last time we were looking at weak versus strong electrolytes. Strong electolytes ionize completely, 100%. While weak electrolytes ionize only partially, usually in the order of one to 10%. That is, the principal species of solutions for strong electrolytes are ions. Strong acids, strong bases, and salts. - That was pretty rough in there today. - What? - Cory's chemistry presentation. She seemed really embarrassed. - Hey, what are you guys talking about? - Nothing. - Cory's science presentation. - I heard about that. Disaster, huh? - Maybe she should have practiced more instead of hanging out at the bonfire. - She did! Remember, we saw her in the science lab that one day? I saw that pickle glow! - Can we talk about something other than pickles for like five minutes? - Sure, sure. - So what happened with the pickles? - I don't know, the electrolytes should have lit it up. Can a pickle get depickled? - What, you mean like, like a cucumber? That's weird because-- - It's impossible for a pickle to get depickled. She must have just done something wrong. - Huh. - Come on, let's get to practice. - I'll catch up with you guys. - Hey, I just wanted to see if you were okay after your presentation. That looked pretty rough up there. - Were you in on it? - In on what? Did something happen? - Nothing, I'm fine. - Well, if you're not busy tonight-- - Sorry, I am. - Are you mad at me? - I'm not mad, I just-- - What? - I don't understand how you can be friends with Edie. - I know she can be hard to get along with. - No, superfluid vacuum theory is hard to get along with. She's just mean. - Look, Edie and I go way back. She's had a hard time. - And so she has to make sure everyone else does, too? - You don't know her. She's hard to get to know, but she's more than she seems. I mean, even a pickle has a light on the inside if you give it a chance, right? Listen, I've got to get to practice, but I'll see you around. - Woo, yeah. Yeah, good morning. Today, I thought that we would try something a little bit different, a little bit exciting. Please give a warm welcome to our special guests, the boys' practice team, the Orcas! Okay, all right, inspiring, and now give an even warmer welcome, to our very special guests, the boys' and girls' E Teams! Let's go, team captains. Lewis, Edie. Boys choose girls, girls choose boys. - Ladies first. - Oliver. - Meredith. - Cory. - What? - George. - Are you sure you meant to pick me? - Why wouldn't I? - It's your turn. - Ben. - Hang on. - Oliver, I'm open, touch. Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry, I didn't realize you were so close. Now we're even. - Hey, are you okay? - Is this why you picked me? - What are you talking about? - So you could embarrass me in front of everyone? - It was an accident. - Yeah, why would I do something like that on purpose? - You're exactly like her, but worse, because you seem really nice, but it's just an act, and then I end up feeling like an idiot. - Cory, come on. - Just leave me alone. - Cory? - So what's going on with you and Sea Girl? - What do you mean? - Come on Edie, I know when I've been made an accomplice to a grand theft pickle. What's your problem with her? - It's not her, it's Oliver. He needs to stay focused this year, and whenever she comes around he acts like a total idiot. - It's not her, he's always kind of an idiot. - Why are you defending her? - She seems nice. A little weird. - A little? She turned a pickle into a light bulb. Well, at least she tried to. - Look, if you want replace all her belongings with cucumbers, fine, just don't make me a part of it, all right? - You were close that time. Well at least you kicked it in the right direction. - It's a ball. Why can't I kick it where I want it to go? - Are you really angry about the ball? - Yes, no, yes but, not just the ball. - Is it Oliver? I know you think he's messing with you, but he's not like that. - I just don't get why he hangs out with her. - Yeah, life's a mystery. Why don't we try something different? Close your eyes. - What? I can't even kick the ball straight with my eyes open. - Just trust me. This is an exercise I use in my dance classes. Okay, take a deep breath in, and slowly release it. Become aware of your body. Where are your arms? Where are your legs? - Connected to my torso? - Shh, now open your eyes, and feel the ball connect with your foot. - Score! And give me five. - What are you doing? - It's a victory dance. We can't exactly use them in any real games, so might as well use them now. Hey, you got the ball into something. That's progress. - What am I doing wrong? - Maybe you're thinking too much. - There's no such thing. - You spend so much time inside of your head. Just let yourself be present in the moment. Like when I'm dancing or playing soccer, I just feel the rest of the world falling away. Just try it. - Okay. - So when you get up to the goal, take a deep breath to steady yourself. Remember, present in the moment. And when you're ready, kick the ball, right to the back of the net. Are you okay? On the positive side, you seem to be pretty flexible. Wait, what's happening over there? - What's going on? - Caitlin Ford is coming here, to Harold. - Oh my gosh. When, why? - For this year's national tournament. - And Caitlin is presenting the trophy to the winning team. - Who's Caitlin Ford? - Only the youngest Australian ever to compete in the World Cup. - She plays wing for the Matildas. - I'm sure you've seen her play for the Australian women's team? Here, have a look. - It'll be great seeing Caitlin again when she hands us the trophy at the tournament. We had all the Matildas at my parents' end-of-summer yacht party. - Don't count your chickens before they hatch, Edie. - What did you say? - I'm pretty sure you heard me. - Oh, I heard you, but unfortunately I Can any of you translate? - Let me make it crystal clear. No one cares that you met Caitlin on your parents' fancy yacht, or whether or not you think you'll win this tournament. Winners are made on the field. - I've seen you out there, Sea Girl. It's also where losers are made. I'll meet you there any time. - You will meet us there. In the finals. - She's delusional. I think you've been exposed to too many chemicals in your little science lab. It's melting your brain. - Okay everyone. Why don't we just take a deep breath. - The only place you'll be during the finals is in the stands, watching me kill it. - Where did that come from? - I'm just so sick of the way she acts all the time. Who cares if her parents are big rock stars? - They're actually TV stars. - Whatever. I wouldn't care if her father was Erwin Schr dinger himself. It doesn't make her the queen of the school. - Shroding-who? - Erwin Schr dinger? Nobel Prize winner? He formulated the wave equation. - Just google it later, she's on a roll. - I'm just not putting up with it any more. - Does that mean you're gonna play in the tournament? - It means we're going to beat her in the tournament. Come on. - My team, why aren't you warming up? - Coach Smith, how long have you been coaching the practice team here at Harold? - Going on 20 years. - And how long has it been since you guys won a game? - Going on 20 years. - What happens next year if they cut the practice team? What if we could change that? - Well, I'd say that you're not gonna become winners by sitting around, so. But I'll give you five minutes. - Okay, so I got this idea in science class. Have you guys ever heard of magnus force? - Sounds like something Superman would use to crush his enemies. - Or you could use it to crush yours. Magnus force describes how a spinning cylinder or sphere moves through the air. In this case, a soccer ball. See, depending on which side you kick and the force you apply, you create unequal drag on the upper and lower surfaces of the ball, which causes it to arc one way or the other. In layman's terms, this is how Beckham bends it. - Cool. - My theory is that if you learn how to visualize the variables inside your head, you can calculate the perfect kick and get it in the goal every time. - That's awesome. - It's like a whole other level to playing the game. - And we need to go to the next level. That's why you're going to design all new uniforms for us. - Wait, I am? - If we want to be winners, we have to act like winners, which means dressing like winners, with uniforms that don't slow us down. - Something breathable and stretchy, but chic and on trend. - So we don't have to look like we're stuck in 1995. - Exactly. - Sounds like you'll be busy. - So will you. - Coach's playbook? - I mean, It would be a playbook, if we had a playbook, and not just a pile of disorganized paper. - Oh, right. - Sorry, no offense. How are we supposed to figure out our plays, if we can't figure out where to get them? Charlotte, do you think you could organize these for us? - A project! - Okay, so we have science, fashion and organization on our side. But the E Team has Edie. How are we supposed to beat her? - By believing that we can. Janessa, I never managed to make a kick before in my life, before you taught me how to visualize it. If you could do that for the rest of the team. - We could really have a shot. - Excuse me, I think we're forgetting something. There will be no changes, to the uniforms, to the playbook, or to the practice, unless the coach signs off on it. I'm totally kidding, I think they're wonderful ideas. Got ya, didn't I? - One, two, three. - WOTB! - I'm so inspirational. - Wonder what's going on over there? - Maybe we should go check it out. - You know maybe, Cory could fill you in. Come on man, focus up. The girls are watching. - Mom? Dad? - Kitten Britches? - I've been trying to reach you guys. - Sorry sweetheart, it's been hard to get a connection out here. How are you holding up? - I'm okay. - Well get ready to be better than okay. We figured out a way to get you out of soccer purgatory. - Even though we think a well-rounded education is important, and sports is great for your cardiovascular health. - We found an international school nearby our medical station. It has a terrific science program, and we can see each other on the weekends. - Oh, wow. - What's wrong? - Nothing, nothing's wrong. - Well, we thought you'd be excited, sweetheart. - Can you guys hear me? Nice acoustics. And the winner of the Nobel Prize for Physics is Corinne Elizabeth Bailey. - Yeah congratulations, it's just, I just really want you to come. It's a big deal to me. I don't understand why you can't come down for one day. There are teams coming from all over the country. Don't say you'll make it up to me. You and dad say that all the time but you never do. It's just another show for you but, this is a big deal for me. Caitlin's gonna hand out the trophy to the winner. Maybe it would be a good photo op for you guys. No, we haven't won yet but, I'm sure my team will. Yes, I know you can't shut down production for a maybe but, you guys haven't seen me play in ages. Yeah okay. I get it. I'll see you on holidays then. Okay, tell Dad I love him. All right, bye. - Hey, what's up? - What do you want? - Nothing just, you know. Keeping it clean and mean. - Nice shoes, loser. - Yeah, my Dad got them for me. He said he had to buy them 'cause they really quacked him up. Normally, I wouldn't wear them, but I've been really missing my parents, so. I just mean, I know what it's like when your parents are gone a lot. My parents won't get to see me play either. - Were you listening in to my call? - Not on purpose, I'm sorry. I was just trying to help. - I don't need your help. And you want to know something, Sea Girl? You don't belong here. You're terrible at soccer, you're dragging your whole team down, and Oliver just-- - What about Oliver? - He doesn't need you distracting him. So why don't you do everyone a favor and go home? - Hey, I hear you guys are trying some cool new science stuff on the field. - Yeah, they are. - They? - The team. - You're not part of the team? - Not anymore. I'm leaving. - Why? - Don't worry about it. You should stay focused on the game. I know it's important to you. - Cory, wait. Cory? - What do you mean she leaves in the morning? - Oliver said her parents found a new school for her. - But she already has a school, this school. - Something must be going on. - I bet anything Edie is behind it. - So what can we do? - We talk to her, convince her to stay. - I've already tried. Her mind is made up. - Did she say why? - Just that she thinks that we don't need her. - Well, she's wrong. - Okay, but what can we do if she won't listen to us? - We show her. Come on. You have some sewing to do. - Hey, I was just finishing up. What is this? They're pickles! Is that supposed to be me? Yep, that's me. And they're glowing because of me? - You're our sodium chloride. We can't glow without you. - I don't know what to say. - So, say you'll stay, because in real life, we can't replace you. - We can't do this without you, Cory. Your friends need you here. - Friends? I have friends. - So what do you say? Will you stay? - How can I say no to a bunch of dancing pickles? ♪ No matter who we are ♪ ♪ No matter where we go ♪ ♪ No matter what we do ♪ ♪ We'll give it all we got ♪ ♪ We'll do it all the way ♪ ♪ We're gonna give it all we got ♪ ♪ Gather round, all together now ♪ ♪ From the ground give it to the crowd ♪ ♪ Then to the end yeah ♪ ♪ Put your hands in the air ♪ ♪ Everybody show your heart ♪ ♪ Never stop, we're gonna make it through ♪ ♪ To the top, because I believe in you ♪ ♪ Friends to the end, yeah ♪ ♪ Put your hands in the air ♪ - Beautiful. ♪ We're gonna give it all we got ♪ ♪ Say we can, we're gonna prove it now ♪ ♪ It's a now, we're gonna sing a song ♪ ♪ Friends to the end, that's what it's all about ♪ ♪ And we do it, all along ♪ ♪ Don't be shy, we're gonna sing it now ♪ ♪ Stick around, we're gonna make it now ♪ ♪ Friends to end, yeah ♪ ♪ Put your hands in the air and show your hearts ♪ - Okay you're looking magnificent my team, let's practice some penalty kicks, let's go.

Get in there, Janessa. - So it's a two-day tournament, which will be good for us because we'll be up against the lower-seeded teams in the first half of the day. - But practice teams don't make it to day two. - You guys, that's not gonna be us. And I hope you've all been practicing our victory dance, because we're going to need it. One, two, three. - WOTB! - Hey ho, let's go. Hey ho, let's go. Hey ho, let's go. Hey ho, let's go.

Congratulations , Harold Academy E Team, and for the first time in 20 years, the Harold Academy Practice Team, will go head-to-head in the finals tomorrow. - Can you believe what we just did? - It worked. I had the whole Magnus thing in my head and it was like bam, pow, swoosh! Right into the goal. - We made it to the finals for the national tournament. That's sick! - And, I'm not gonna lie, we looked great doing it. - One, two, three. - WOTB! - Finals, here we come. - I can't believe I'm gonna say this, but don't wash your socks, Janessa. We need all the luck we can get if we're gonna beat the E team. - Lucky for you, I am not taking these off until after the tournament. - Somebody crack a window. - Guys, we don't need luck, and I'm not afraid of Edie. - Did you guys see her today? I think she's afraid of us. - Forget Edie. Did you see Oliver watching us today? - I don't think he was watching us. - When are you guys gonna give it up? - He even wears out jersey color. - So, yellow suits his complexion. - Oh, so you've noticed his complexion have you? - Whatever, I'm a scientist. I observe things. It's like my job. Oh look, I just observed that my water bottle is empty. I gotta stay hydrated. Better go fill this up. Anybody else? Nope? Okay, bye. Totally busted. - Totally busted for what? - Where, how? Oh my gosh, you're everywhere. - Well, I'm not everywhere, but I am here, to see you, actually. I was just dropping by to see if you want to grab a fizzy drink or something. - I have my water bottle. - Okay, well good luck in the finals tomorrow. - Wait! I guess one soda couldn't hurt. - So everything's looking really promising. - So does that mean they're interested? - Yeah, scouts from three clubs came up to talk to me. They're meeting with my coaches after the tournament. - That's awesome, I'm so happy for you. - You know what else is awesome? That kick today. I swear that ball took a perpendicular turn between Charlotte's foot and the net. - I told you, it's just physics. It makes perfect sense once you know how to do it. - Soccer I can talk to you about all day long, but when you get to physics, you lose me. - Okay, watch. So here's the goal, okay? - Sure. - And here's the ball. A lot of players know how to bend the ball, but for for less experienced players, accuracy can be a problem right? Until you understand the science of what causes the ball to change direction. Imagine a rocket blasting off. The gas is shooting down out of the rocket, which pushes it up. It's the same with a spinning ball. The air going in the direction of the spin goes around the ball and pushes to the side like the gas coming out of a rocket, so the air on the other side of the ball has to push back and, blast off. The ball bends and goes straight into the net. - You get so excited when you talk about science. - Well, I mean it's pretty exciting stuff. Some things you can predict, but some things, you have no clue what's going to happen till you test your theory. - Yeah, sometimes you have to test your theory. - Uh huh. I don't know if I can trust you. - Why not? - Every time I see you, you're with Edie. - I'm not with Edie right now. - I just don't get it. - I told you, she's more than what she seems. - Did you two used to date or something? - No. - Are you seeing her now? - No, what do I have to do to get you to see that I like you? - It doesn't matter anyway. I can't have any distractions right now. Neither of us can. - I'm not trying to distract you. - Good, then you understand. - Oh, let me at least walk you to your dorm. - I think I'd rather just be alone and clear my head, for the big game, you know? - Yeah, okay. Good luck tomorrow. - Thanks. - Hey. - You scared me. - Where were you? We were gonna organize a search party. But then everybody fell asleep. - Oliver. - What happened? - I think he was about to kiss me. - About to? - But then I basically accused him of either spying for Edie or dating her, or both. - Yeah, that wouldn't do it. Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. Now go back to bed. We have to kick Edie's butt tomorrow. - You should take your own advice. - I will, promise, okay? - Sleep well. - Welcome parents, alumni, students and visitors. Today is the day we have been waiting for. Our Harold Academy National Tournament Final is here at last. Today's game should be very exciting and will be topped off by an awards presentation from the international soccer legend, Caitlin Ford. Cheers to the participating teams! - E Team, E Team, E Team, E Team, E Team, E Team. - All right guys, circle up. When we go out there today, they're gonna discount us because they think we're just the practice team. Well guess what? Practice is over. This is it, this is when all of our hard work comes together and we show everyone at this school that we are champions. - Now let's get out there on the field and-- - One, two, three, WOTB! - Yeah. Yes, I am so inspirational. - Wait, what are you doing? - I forgot my water bottle, I'll be right there. - Hurry up. - Hello? Hello? - E Team, E Team, E Team. - Five minutes to kick off. Harold Academy's own E Team versus the practice team for the championship. - Hello? Is somebody there? Please. I'm stuck. - Nice shirt. - Like it? Hey, where's Cory? - Dunno, maybe she chickened out. - Hey Janessa, is Cory coming? - I don't know, she said she was getting her water bottle. If she's not out here before the game starts, she's gonna be disqualified from play. - Where's Cory? - I don't know. - Help! Is anybody out there? Please! - Cory? - I'm locked in the bathroom. Hello? - Cory? - Oliver? - How did you lock yourself in? - I didn't. - Okay, where's the key? - How should I know? - The game's about to start. You won't be able to play if you don't get out there. - But the girls need me! We're a team, WOTB. - I'll go get someone. - There's no time. - Stand back. - That sounds like it hurt. - Nope, I'm good. - Wait! We can't start the game without singing the anthem first. - What are you talking about? We don't sing the anthem. - Well, it's about time we start. - Are you kidding me? ♪ Australians all let us rejoice. ♪ ♪ For we are young and free ♪ ♪ We've golden soil and wealth for toil ♪ ♪ Our home is girt by sea ♪ - Okay, here we go.

According to the rules of the tournament, we will be going straight into a penalty shootout. - Janessa? - No. - Are you okay? - I think it's sprained. Cory, you have to take my place. - Now? I can't. I've never made a penalty kick in my life. Somebody else. - No, you. - You brought us here. - None of us would be here without you. - But-- - Listen to me. Just a few short weeks ago, you were Sea Girl. Just a science brain with no idea what she was doing at a soccer camp. But Cory, you're so much more than that. You're a dancer. - A swimmer. - A soccer player. - And our friend. You've come so far, but you only have one more step to go. You can do this. The only person who doesn't believe it, is you. - Put me in. - WOTB. - WOTB! - Yes, yes. - Good job, you do the rest. - I can't take another round of this. - Then you better get it in. - Come on, come on. - Just let yourself be present in the moment.

And the winner of the tournament is, Harold Soccer Academy Practice Team. - You did it. - What? - We wouldn't be here without you. - Congratulations. - WOTB! - What do you want, Edie? I don't have time for your games right now. - Fine, forget about it. I knew it was stupid anyway. - Okay Edie, I'll bite. What is it? - I just wanted to say cngrtltns. - Excuse me? - Congratulations. - Would it be any easier if you tried to spell it? - I said, congratulations. You guys were really good out there today. - Thank you. - And I was wondering if you could teach me some of that soccer physics stuff? - Oh really? But I thought you knew everything there was to know about soccer. - I do, but I don't know everything there is to know about science. You know we might actually make a killer team. - Hmm, well you have a ways to go before you could make it on my team, but if you're willing to work, come by our practice tomorrow after school. - All right loser, see you then. - Edie, wait. - Why? Why do you have such a problem with me? - Oliver and I have been friends since we were little kids, and I think I was afraid you were gonna take him away from me. - What? - Not romantically. He's like a brother to me, it's just, I'm not like you. I don't have a lot of friends. I have to hold on to the few that I do have. - I didn't used to be like me, either, with lots of friends. But every day is chance to be someone you weren't yesterday. What are you doing right now? - Nothing. - Come on. - Where are we going? - We're going to make some new friends. - That your phone? - I'm sorry, I have to take this. Hi guys! - We're sorry we've been out of contact for so long. - The power lines went down out here and it's been a real mess. - But guess what? It'll take a couple of weeks to finish processing your enrollment, but there's a spot available at that international school we told you about. You can leave tonight! Cory? - Listen up everyone. I just received official word from the school. The practice teams won't be back next year. They're being combined with the other teams. So everyone will play together in the same squad! - Cory? - Sorry, what were you saying? - We're gonna spring you from that joint, Kitten Britches. - Oh, about that, didn't you get my message? I think I want to stay here. - Are you sure? - I'm sure. I'm actually really, really sure. I gotta go guys. I love you.
