Subtitles by explosiveskull Resync by GoldenBeard I dreamt I would meet a brilliant man. I would steal his breath away.. ....and he, in turn, would steal me away from everything ugly into a secret world of our own. Claire? Oliver? - Wake up, sleepyhead. - Put me down. No, tradition is tradition and you deserve to be treated like a princess. You do realize we're participating in a symbolic kidnapping that stretches all the way back to the founding of Rome. What are you talking about? In memory of the Sabine women who were taken in violence by the Romans. It all belongs to you now, my pet. Claire, Oliver, this is Elizabeth. Welcome home, Elizabeth. Home. I can't believe I'm finally here. Where would you like supper served? Upstairs. Thank you, Claire. Oliver. Do you like white orchids? I love them. How about lilies? Sure. You're in luck. Would you like a cognac? No, thank you, Claire. Are you sure? Yes. That's all for today, thank you. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Goodnight, Claire. Wow. I believe these are all your favorite pieces. Could I stay in here a while? Not now, darling. There's a lot more to see. - Hello, Oliver. - Good morning. - Good morning, Claire. - Good morning. Claire. This way. What's in this room? You're my wife and I trust you implicitly. That sounds ominous. Everything I have shown you the art, the jewels the clothes, the money in the safe all of it is for you. The only off-limits room is this one. Oh. Do you promise not to go in? But I can't even get into the rooms without you. Of course, you can. The biometric readers are programmed for two thumbprints yours and mine. No one else's. These are our rooms to play in. I have to leave first thing in the morning. Work matters. On our honeymoon? It's not ideal, I know, but it's just for the day. It will give you time to familiarize yourself with the house. You'll be a good girl, won't you? - Have you decided on lunch? - Uh, um.. No, I'm not hungry. You should eat. Okay, um, I don't know. Perhaps just a light salad is fine. - And what would you like in it? - Um, uh, surprise me. Uh, okay, a... avocado and tomato. - And to drink? - Just water, thanks. No, um, could I get a milkshake? Cho... Chocolate. What's funny? Nothing. A chocolate milkshake is the perfect choice. Claire. Is it okay if I ask you something? Ask. Have you worked here a long time? Yes. - For Henry? - Yes. He's ridiculously smart, isn't he? He's, um.. His IQ, his mind is... is extraordinary. - Yes. - Mm. So why would he pick a girl like me to marry? I'm very.. ...simple. I don't know. Satie founded his own religion. Did you know that? He was the official composer for the Mystical Order of the Rose and Cross of the Temple and Grail founded by the occultist Joseph Peladan. But they had a falling out and Satie founded his own religion. L'Eglise Metropolitaine d'Art de Jesus Conducteur. Sorry. You must find this incredibly boring. Forgive me. No, no, it's very interesting. I can go on and on sometimes. Come here. It's your job to shut me up. I'm like a little boy around you. I can't help myself. How did your work stuff go? - Fine. - That's good. The fire has been duly put out. - How was your day here? - Oh, it was fine. It's so much to take in. I hadn't thought about the practicalities of running such a big home. Um.. ...I tried to make a phone call yesterday but the line was dead. Yes, that happens all the time here. - Oh. - Who were you calling? - My sister. - Oh. What happened? Oh, I don't know. You may as well know that I'm a bit of a clumsy. - Are you now? - Yes. I hope it doesn't disappoint you. How could you ever disappoint me? Just if you thought I was.. ...suave and elegant all the time. You're such a good liar, it's scary. - What? - I call your bluff. Hm, not sure I know I know what you're talking about. I think you've always been suave and elegant. What do you say we send the servants away and spend the rest of the day in bed? What about our stroll on the lake? We can always stroll tomorrow. There's a very corruptible quality about you, Elizabeth. I didn't hurt you, did I? The only measure of an action.. ...is its consequence. Elizabeth, my pet. ...you do not deserve this but you did disobey me. - Please. - Please? I don't know what you think I saw. I don't think you saw. It is what happened what will happen. Please. That's deep enough, Henry. Henry? Oliver. Let me hear you say it's done, please. I disagree. But, but you looked me in the eye and you said... I did not! I want absolute calm. Can we manage that? You want to get caught? It's not an option I'm really considering. Only a matter of when. Surely you're still lucid enough... The only.. The only way we get caught is if you insist on lurking in corridors staring meaningfully at them. Hm. You prick. Well, that went well. You haven't touched your food. Do you think it's possible substances have their own velocity? - For instance? - Eggs. Eggs. Because it changes form, the egg. Its whole function is to become something else. It keeps disappearing and reappearing as something new. I can't think of anything else in the world with that kind of material altruism. Material altruism is moral altruism. Exactly. Funny that the egg should be a symbol for the soul. Don't you think? I heard you have a migraine. So sorry. Let's not talk about it. Sit down. I can come back tomorrow. No, you're here now. You want a drink? Well, what are you having? Scotch. Hope it knocks it on the head. Mm-hmm. I'll have what you're having. Stress-related, aren't they, migraines? Yes, they can be. Or tension from exercise lack of sleep, hypersensitivity to light. It could be many things. I'd suggest fresh air and walks by the ocean but, uh, you're the doctor. You need to be more than a doctor to understand a person's mind. You need to be a saint or a prophet. How's your lovely, young wife? - Young and lovely. - Is she home? Yes, she's having a nap. Young people today need their beauty sleep. How glorious to be young and lovely... What's on your mind, Frank? - Nothing. - You seem worried. Is everything alright? Uh, department's being investigated for accepting payoffs. Bureaucrats hunting scalps for appearance's sake. I... I've been spared, but I've got a couple of colleagues that are in real hot water. You have to testify against your colleagues. There's no choice. I'm not looking forward to it. You can either torture or be tortured. There's no third alternative. In the end, better to be the torturer. Don't you think? Aren't you a barrel of fucking laughs? - Yes, Oliver. - Made you something. Could you stop making me things? That would be so kind. Why do you stay if you're so unhappy? I know things you don't. Let's leave it at that. Because you love him. You always have. I can see why you would think that. And don't take this the wrong way but you're a child and you don't know what you're talking about. I know this much and it's more than you seem to. We're not the prize. We're the bait. Thank you, Oliver. May I be alone now? I dreamt I would meet a brilliant man. I would steal his breath away and he, in turn, would steal me away from everything ugly into a secret world of our own. Claire? Oliver? You do realize we're participating in a symbolic kidnapping that stretches all the way back to the founding of Rome. Henry, what's in there? Everything I have shown you is yours. All the art, the jewels, the clothes the money in the safe, it's all for you. The only off-limits room is this one. That's all I ask of you. Can you do that for me? Yes, of course, but what's in there... Let's say, it's the one room in the house I can have to myself for work. You promise not to go in? I think husbands and wives should always be truthful. Wouldn't you agree? My point precisely. So if it's that important to you... It is. Promise? I promise. I have to leave first thing in the morning. - Work matters. - On our honeymoon? It's not ideal, I know, but it's just for the day. Give you time to make yourself at home. You'll be a good girl, won't you? I couldn't sleep. Where's Henry? In bed. I forgot how much he snores. What were you looking at? I wasn't... looking at anything. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.. I'm just so curious, that's all. What about? Everything. Sometimes it feels like my mind is just one question after another. You, for example. Me? Your sense of confidence. Do you ever get frightened? - Elizabeth... - Elizabeth? In the kitchen, my love. Elizabeth, listen.. Claire, what are you doing here? I forgot something. Did you find it? Yes. Goodnight. Claire? Oliver? Good morning, my love. Were you having a bad dream? - What time is it? - Lunchtime. Didn't hear you come in. You must have been very tired. Did you stay up late? You left me all alone. I've given Claire and Oliver the day off. Be right back. - What are you thinking about? - Uh, what? I asked what you're thinking about. Oh, I don't know. Nothing. I knew you'd say that. Why? What are you thinking? How everything is made of patterns. Once you can predict the way a person will act you can learn how to control them. Oh, Henry, what are you doing? A moment of privacy. We will have privacy.. ...before our last rites. What? A husband and wife should always be truthful. Your words. But I didn't do anything wrong. You did disobey me. Come on. Easy. Easy, huh? It's okay. - Emergency Services. - Hello? I'm stuck. I'm locked inside a house. My house. Are you hurt? No, I'm not hurt, but I... I can't work any of the doors. They're locked on a mechanism and it... it's not functioning. One moment, please. - Are you still there? - Yes. So you're locked in? Yes. Can you, please, help me? Can I have your name, please? Elizabeth. And your surname? Kellenberg. What's the... What's the address? - I need an address. - I don't know the address. I... I have to go. Good morning. Good morning. Where's Henry? Upstairs. He's not feeling well. He's resting. Emergency Services. I need a.. You walk out that door I can't protect you from the police. Excuse me? I need you to understand you'd be dumb to try. I know he's dead. Where's the body? - Elizabeth. - He tried to kill me. I believe you. - It's upstairs. - Take me. I was only protecting myself. I know. Henry had many tricks in his bag. A brilliant man with a brilliant mind. Just as you imagined in your fairy tale dream. You would steal his breath away and he would steal you away... Away from everything ugly.. - To a secret world of our own. - To a secret world of our own. How could you know that? How much do you remember of your childhood? I was sick a lot in the hospital. My parents died in a car crash. I was brought up in an orphanage. That's back there where I sleep. You were there till age 8. You had a teacher, Mrs. Merger and a French groundskeeper... - Chucks. - Chucks. Very good. All of that did happen. See, it's not an exact science, biogenesis. Claire is much better suited than me to walk you through it. She was in charge of your conditioning. She's quite clever. Oliver.. ...what am I? You went into the room he told you not to go into. Did you not? I did. What I saw, I don't understand. You saw yourself. Yes. Which brings us to the only question worth asking. You were cooked in that room like an egg. Six identical genetic copies. Elizabeth number five of the Elizabeth Harvest. That's what you are. Car. What? Can you see the color? It's, um.. It's black with a red light on top. - Fuck, that was quick. - Who is it? Detective Lieutenant Logan, Henry's only friend. - A... and what does he want? - He wants to talk to you again. What do you mean again? Henry explained away you sleeping all the time as chronic fatigue syndrome. It's gonna help you today. Make light of the fact Henry is the one napping but get him to leave quickly. - Good morning, Oliver. - Good morning, detective. - Your father around? - Upstairs, taking a nap. Yeah, well, since when does he take naps? I know, but it happens. Ask Elizabeth. Oh. Hello again. Mrs. Kellenberg, it's truly a surprise. Because usually I'm the one napping, right? Henry isn't feeling well. I was beginning to think he kept you locked up in a tower. Is there something you want? - You know, to drink? - Uh, what are you having? Oliver, would you mind getting us something? - Water's fine. - Water's just fine. - Are you in trouble? - What? Did you call Emergency Services? When? I got a message that a Mrs. Kellenberg called in so I came to check it out. Word sure travels fast. Word? Of what? Claire getting rushed to hospital. Isn't that why you're here? What's wrong with Claire? She had a heart condition, congenital. She's the one who called emergency and the operator must have gotten confused. Excuse me. You didn't call? No, I didn't. It was Claire. She did. Ah. Let me see if I got this straight. Your husband's not feeling well Claire has a weak heart you have chronic fatigue syndrome and Oliver, of course, is blind. Now I don't mean to be insensitive but it's beginning to feel like a hospital around here. - Oh, my God! - Did I get him? - Oh, my God! - Did I get him? Yes. Nobody you need to feel bad about. Why... Why did you do that? This bastard was on Henry's payroll. Caught one of you three years ago making a run for it and brought you right back here. What do you think Henry did with her? He killed her? See? You're clever. He killed all of you. It's what he lived for. Henry was your father. Not anymore. I think I'm gonna be sick. It's okay. It's okay. That was scary. What do you remember after age 8? There's a gap, isn't there? He put you back in the tank. He'd bring you out at different times for physical therapy. He'd fill your mind with memories and events music trying to customize your personality trying to make you whole, but you never actually experienced any of that... Stop! Please, I want to wake up now! Please, make it stop. I want things to go back to normal! Alright. I want to go back to my honeymoon. Alright. Help me with him. I think you should get as far away from here as possible, Elizabeth. Go and pack a bag. - You're staying? - I have to. Make sure to take some money from the safe. You'll need it. Um, how much? Like that. Okay. Elizabeth? I'm in here. Before you go, I wonder if you could do something for me. What is it? This journal. I can't read it and I need some information in it. - It's Henry's? - Claire's. Hey, what are you doing? Oliver? Oliver, did you just lock me in? Oliver? Oliver, let me out! Oliver! No! Let me out! Oliver! Everyone in the scientific community knew about Dr. Henry Kellenberg's breakthroughs in somatic cell research. But after pioneering and patenting the process by which microRNA cells were reprogrammed into the TERX2 encoding he retired a billionaire. Years later, out of the blue he invited me to come see him. This was the pivotal moment of my professional life. Dr. Claire Stratton. Dr. Kellenberg, this is an honor. Oh. You worked at Baxter? Yes, yes, un... until quite recently. - You were fired? - It's complicated. What I heard was you refused to share your research with the military. If my information is incorrect, I apologize. Uh, no, you're clearly well informed. I am intrigued by your work in neurodegeneration. Your views on Progeria go against practically everyone's. That's why you're here. 'Cause my findings were refuted by the entire medical community. Can I offer you some refreshment? When I was younger, I had so much drive and inexhaustible energy. I was obsessed with the idea of being useful to future generations. Now I know history will remember me unkindly. I think we both know you're being modest. Well, history will remember me as a monster and that is where you come in. A healthy mind to bear witness. - Oliver? - I finished my homework, dad. - Hello. - Hello. Oliver, this is Claire, a brilliant researcher. She'll be staying with us. So lovely to meet you, Oliver. Pleased to make your acquaintance, Claire. You have a way of making assumptions, doctor. Hm. A healthy mind to bear witness, he called it. But at what cost? I am a trained scientist. I respect process. I believe in research, testing, analysis. And yet here I was in the middle of a tragic love story inexplicable, inconvenient and impossible. Fr... From... From an ethical and moral standpoint... Yes, I... I will be crucified. - Yes. - Yes, but I cannot undo it. I know why I did what I did, Claire. The question is given human subjects and unlimited means can you crack the code? Perhaps. Kellenberg's wife had died shortly after giving birth to a son, Oliver of a very rare strain of Werner Syndrome in which her mutated WRN suddenly degenerated at a dizzying rate. Sick with grief, he cloned her cells and harvested six copies. Complications began almost immediately. At birth, two of the subjects already displayed the mutation. In order to buy himself time Kellenberg did something even more radical. He customized hyperbaric chambers into cryogenic tanks and he put the bodies in suspended animation while he searched for a cure. Good morning, Elizabeth. By the time I joined the project only four subjects remained alive. Good morning, Elizabeth. Two years later, I cracked it. Henry? Every night, Henry recorded messages and played music for the subjects convinced the ideas absorbed into their minds would develop as memories. I was dubious. What do you remember after age eight? Subject emerged biologically and physiologically healthy but disoriented and in pain. She seemed to remember nothing for more than a few seconds. Yes, I was happy three times. When Mrs. Merger let me play in the garden, is one and then when I had a um, I had a... a chocolate milkshake. That was good. And then also.. Abysses of amnesia continually opened beneath her and unable to maintain a genuine inner world she would bridge them with scrambled fictions. What's this? I can't run at all today, I don't think. Are you a soldier? No, Elizabeth, it's me, Henry. Henry! When did you fly in? Henry was convinced she would acclimate and her repertoire of memories would match up. But the constant strain on her mind became too much for her body to bear. Days later, somehow under Henry's watch she discovered the harvest room. What... What did my niece say? - She's your niece? - My sister's child. She's had a long, troubled history. I'd hoped the move from the city would help her, but.. She made some pretty bizarre accusations. She's a danger to herself. Yeah, she has a habit of inventing stories. She's a bit of a fantasist, I'm afraid. At times, her behavior can be utterly illogical. Are you her legal guardian? I... I'm the only family she has left. Well then, I am fine to release her to you but I'm afraid I have to file a report. Elizabeth? Look, I realize you're upset, but I had to run some errands and I needed you to stay. I apologize. I phoned the hospital. They're keeping Claire for observation run tests for a couple of days. But she will recover. Are you reading the journal? I know you can hear me. I've brought you some supper. I'm going to open the door now. Please don't do anything crazy. - Let me go! - Please, stop! Please! - The code! - What? The front door code, what is it? - I'll open it for you. - Tell me the code! It's your birthdate. The code! What's my birthdate? 0-9-16. - Are you lying to me? - I'm not. Elizabeth, I'm on your side. I always have been. I knew it was wrong to lock you up, but I just I wanted to talk to you and I couldn't foresee any other way you wouldn't flee this place. Yeah, well, you're right about that. What are you doing? You don't have to do this. - If you're lying to me.. - I already told you. I just want you to get to know me. I sincerely apologize for the childish trick. But I do need to finish our conversation. - What are you doing to her? - Keeping her alive. Same as I did for you. I can't express how odd it is to feel so close to someone who doesn't know you exist and then to finally meet. At the end of the day, the world is a conflict between positive and negative charges. I so had hoped once we were free of him we could be candid with one another. Why won't you let me go? The last thing I want to do is keep you here against your will. I just require you to have a little bit more patience. Here, take the head while I turn her over. Claire usually does this bit. When can I go? I've waited so long to have these conversations with you. Just tell me when I can go. Once you tell me how much Claire knew. Please, give me a hand. If you really wish to harm me I can't possibly hide from you, can I? You have the advantage now. So curious. Wake up, Elizabeth. Darling, wake up. Elizabeth? Are you her legal guardian? I... I'm the only family she has left. Well then, I am fine to release her to you but I'm afraid I have to file a report. I apologize. Is that absolutely necessary... Claire, let me speak with the detective. You've been through enough. Thank you. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. With Detective Logan silenced we proceeded with our tests. One week later, she was dead. Henry, what happened? I found her face-down on the pillows. She must have suffocated. - How? - I don't know. We need to run more tests. Find out why her body shut down. The questions I had, I never asked. Partly because I didn't want to believe it. Partly because when we analyzed her cells we discovered the neurodegeneration had returned. I had failed. The data-flow resulting from the large sequencing throughout.. All four mutations altered only the C-terminal portion of the genes.. ...in nuclear shape due to the mutated gene resulting in.. ...makes the nucleus unstable.. ...cellular instability appears.. Interestingly, after the splicing correction the HGPS cells show.. ...process and causes damage itself.. ...ten hours every day for the next six months until we had exhausted every combination. When the inevitable happened I was ready for it. I initiated it. I think we should turn off the machines, Claire. We can't do that. It's not working. I've wasted so many years of my life like a fool. I was still a lunatic. Or a husband in love. You have no right to be this good to me. Finally, we agree on something. Come here. Let's try this again. Quid pro quo. Do you know what that means? I don't think you do. It's Latin. Is it Latin for fuck off? Means an equal exchange. I give you something.. ...and you give me something in return. I want to know what she says about me in exchange for which I'll tell you about yourself. What if I don't want to know? Oh, it's built into your DNA to want to know. It's your nature. What does she say? Doesn't say anything about you. What does she write about? She initiated an affair with Henry after the death of the third subject. After he choked her. She had her doubts, but she didn't ask because she failed at figuring the code. She didn't fail. He corrupted the samples. - How would you know? - Because I know him. So she figures it out. You want to know if you're cured? Quid pro quo. Yes. She reversed the neurodegeneration. You're all clear. You all lived here until you were eight hidden from the world, never allowed out. I was sent to boarding school. Came back the summer I turned 12 and there was just one of you here the second Elizabeth. The first, he killed. You and the others were in your tanks. I didn't know this at the time, of course. I pieced it all together later. Like you, I wasn't allowed in the forbidden room. That summer, you were the prettiest strangest creature I ever saw. And how would you know if you're blind? I wasn't then. I told you all my secrets and you told me about your nightmares. And he couldn't stand it us being together, being children. And one night, I spied on the two of you and you were standing perfectly still.. ...like a little doll, holding up your skirt and asking him what he was doing at every step and him kissing you everywhere. I couldn't stand it so I confronted him. That night, Henry attacked me in my sleep and later, he claimed it was an electrical fire that made me blind. I hated him touching you but you didn't mind at all. That wasn't me. Oliver, that wasn't me. Just as I had initiated it I brought the affair to an end. Not that it ever had a chance of being anything more than colleagues letting off steam. Not that it could ever compete with.. It's Elizabeth's birthday today. Yes, I remember. May I ask you something? Ask. Have you ever been in love? Intense, passionate love? The kind where you swear to protect that person and care for them your whole life? Till death do you part. Isn't that the fine print though? When you exchange marriage vows you sign up for the long haul. Conflict, and pain, and guilt and longing, in sickness and in health, et cetera. Not for an accident that decimates your beloved two years later. That is not the deal you made with fate. We are, each of us an eventual tragedy. What is it you want, Henry? - Really want? - I'm afraid of what I want. That's never stopped you before. I want to relive my wedding night. You want to fuck young, adoring flesh that never grows old. Now don't be crass, Claire. It's not that. I want to experience that euphoria again. I wish you had known her. She was the real thing, a force... Of joy. You've told me a few hundred times. You understand it has nothing to do with us. You don't believe me but I meant it when I said there is no us. I have to experience it again and if you have any reservations, Claire... If feeling sick to my stomach is a reservation. Fine. I can see it through on my own. Perhaps you should leave. We are defined by the choices we make. Why didn't I go? Can't find any record of Elizabeth giving birth. Professor Oliver Eccleston was the name of your very first mentor at Fielding. It's a bit sentimental, but that's you all over. I want us to grow old together but I thought what if she doesn't want this decaying old body. What if she yearns for what she fell in love with? A younger me. He's not your son, is he? Oliver is you. But he doesn't know it. Oh, my God. Wake up. - What are you doing? - Tell me. Tell you what? You know what I need to know. Where have you been the last two days? - Busy. - What happened to your hand? - Nothing. - Well, it's bleeding. - I bumped into something. - Oh, you're bleeding a lot. It was sharp. Quit stalling. What does she write about me? She thinks you're Henry. - But you're not. - You're lying. I can hear it in your voice. Henry showed her the birth certificate had her call the doctor. You are not his clone, you're his son so you can hate his guts if you want but you're not him. You can be whoever you want. I hated him so much. We both did. But now he's gone and we are defined by the choices we make. You love me, don't you? - I always have. - So why don't you show me? Boy, you learn fast. You saw him touching me. It made you very jealous. Now he's gone. And you can touch me. We've both been held captive by a monster. We deserve something good. I'm right here but you have to come closer. - So you could attack me? - No. So you can use those shears and cut off my underwear and make me yours. Don't be scared. I won't bite. Closer. I can feel your heartbeat. It's beating so fast. Show me you love me. Drop the shears! The code! The real door code! - 3-3-1-4-7-4. - Again! 3-3-1-4-7-4. Now the key to this thing! I should kill you. I wish I could make things better. I hate everything about you! Stop it! Stop right now! - Oh, no. - Elizabeth, thank God. - Who are you? - I'm, I'm Elizabeth. No, you're not. Henry, who is she? Henry? No. He's... He's not Henry. He's Oliver. Don't listen to her. She's sick in the head, my love. I don't know what he's told you but there's noth, there's nothing wrong with me. - This is very heavy. - So, please, put it down. You... You have the rifle? I have the rifle and it's very heavy. Tell her to get on her belly. - Why does she look like me? - She is an imposter. She's very dangerous. She's our enemy. No, I don't... I don't know what he's told you but you and I are not enemies, okay? He's the enemy. We're prisoners here. You hear how crazy she sounds. He... He won't let us out of the house. That's all I want to do. I just... I just want to go. But he had me chained in here. Look. I swear to you. I swear to you, look. - Is that true? - Yes, it's true. But I had to to keep her from hurting herself. She insists on going outside. Doesn't want to believe that the air is not safe! - What? No! - Get on your belly! - Forehead on the floor! - No. Elizabeth, please, put that down. Do it. There's absolutely nothing wrong with the air outside. F... Forehead on the floor! She's down, Henry. Now what? No! Please, don't hurt him! Elizabeth, put it down. Put it down. - I can explain everything. - Let him go! Tell her! Tell her not to shoot! I'm sorry. I love you so much. You will get him killed. You don't understand what's really going on. - Now put it down. - Please, don't hurt him. - Let him go. - You and I are the same. Please, I beg you... You dreamt you would meet a brilliant man. You will steal his breath away and he, in turn, will steal you away from everything ugly into a secret world of our own. Elizabeth.. Henry? I'm here. Is everything alright? I... I thought I heard.. I've renegotiated your contract on your behalf. I trust you'll find the changes satisfactory. What did you do to her? There's a title transfer as well. Everything I own will be yours so that you can continue your research. I wouldn't go down there, Claire. I'm calling the police. Call them. What would you tell them? A murder has occurred? "Who has died, ma'am?" Most women hate being called ma'am. It's why men call them. "Who has been murdered? Someone who died years ago?" "Are you intoxicated, ma'am? Have you been drinking?" "Are you off your medication, ma'am?" Who are you? I didn't set out to kill the very person I've spent my life trying to revive. It just happened. Isn't that a remarkable phrase? It just happened. Elizabeth was mine gave herself of her own free will to me. I have it in writing and she died. But now.. ...she brings me joy.. ...out of the reach of man's law out of reality, as we know it by dying over and over.. ...and no one need know about it. I feel no shame. There's no consequence. You're so sick. Maybe. But these versions of her they're not my Elizabeth. And the look in their eyes. Somewhere in them, they all knew it wasn't going to work. It was only through the act of destroying them.. ...that they finally felt real to me. Henry.. ...this has to stop. Unquestionably. I'll do my utmost, Claire. Elizabeth. Welcome home, Claire. Home. You've earned it. So do something good with it. I dreamt I would meet a brilliant man. I would steal his breath away and he, in turn, would steal me away from everything ugly into a secret world of our own. But I'm awake now. Subtitles by explosiveskull Resync by GoldenBeard
