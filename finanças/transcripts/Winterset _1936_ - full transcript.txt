Police? - I don't know, they wore no uniforms. They just drove the car away. Maria Mia, you will pack bags for you and the little one. You'll go to New York. Now... tonight. It is perhaps dangerous that you should remain here. I want to stay with you, Daddy. Ademio, wash the face, wash it good. Then you ride the train to New York. You'll come too, Daddy? - Yes, Mio. tomorrow. Papa Mio, why be afraid? - The pamphiets, the papers... everything for the meeting tonight in the car. Oh, my poor Mio. - For myself I do not mind. But if they arrest me, what will happen to you and the little one? Sometimes I wish you could be like other men, working only for yourself, for me, for the baby. It is for him that I work, Maria, for his future. ??????? ?????? ? ??????? Leavin' a little early, Tommy? - Ah, a little bit. Thanks. They got the paymaster! - Why, he's dead. Who did it? - Did you see them? Went around the corner. I got his number, it's 93567. The people of this Commonwealth against Batalamio Romagna, murder in the first degree. Yas, sir, I got the license number as the car drove away. We found the car, abandoned, up on Macey's Hill. The revolver and the empty pouch were in the front seat. The back of the car was filled with radical pamphlets. There's no question the paymaster was killed by a bullet fired from this gun. He worked at the factory for two years. He would know exactly what time the paymaster come on. He owes me $40 for printing all for pamphlets. He couldn't have done it! He was home with me. Daddy didn't kill the man. Batalamio Romagna, stand up. Have you anything to say why the sentence of death should not be passed upon you? In all my life, I have never stole and I have never killed. I am an innocent man. Everyone who knows me knows this. And you, Mr. Judge, you know this, too. You will send me to my death and should be sorry for me. But really, it is me who is sorry for you. In the dark night, I will be before you, and you will know you have done wrong. You will be afraid... of me. I am not afraid. It is not me who goes to death, Mr. Judge. It is you. A living walking death, with my face and my voice following you everywhere. And I'm sorry for you. There is only one thing left for this court to do. It is not a matter of discretion, it is a matter of the law that is to pronounce sentence. Therefore, it is considered and ordered by the court that you, Batalamio Romagna, suffer the punishment of death by a current electricity through your body within the week beginning on Sunday, the 20th of November, in this year of our Lord 1920. They've done it. You saw tham, Mio. You saw them murder your father. An Eastern Law School - 1936 It is the custom of this University to give to the graduating class each year some noteworthy case to analyze. From the evidence, from the attendant circumstances, and with the perspective that comes with time. This year you will consider the case of Batalamio Romagna, who, 16 years ago, died in the electric chair for the murder of a paymaster he was accused of robbing. Atlantic University Examination Book Name Lucius Croxton Subject Romagna Case Date June 8 Findings Not Guilty His own lawyer did nothing for him. Subject Romagna Case Findings Not Guilty There wasn't one witness who could actually identify him as participating in the whole thing. Subject Romagna Case Findings Not Guilty There wasn't a shred of direct evidence against him. Alright. Yes, sir, I'll tell him. Yes? - I'm from "The Daily Globe". Dean Liggett's talking to the press. Go right in. Thanks. One hundred and eighty-four candidates for the bar. Every one of them agreed that there was no cause for Romagna's conviction beyond mob hysteria. This is the first time that such a unanimously dissenting opinion has been presented by such a body. Beyond that, they discovered some new evidence. Shortly after the murder, the police arrested, on information, a boy named Garth Estress, who was suspected of being implicated in the holdup in which the murder occured. If this was so, his testimony would either have cleared Romagna, or once and for all, have convicted him. But his testimony was never given, for the simple reason that he never called upon to testify. LAW CLASS ATTACKS ROMAGNA EXECUTION LIGGETT BLAMES HYSTERIA FOR ROMAGNA CONVICTION ROMAGNA COMVICTION BRANDED UNFAIR DEAN LIGGETT DEMANDS REHEARING PAROLED Trock Estrella. Convicted two years ago of narcotic violation, Trock Estrella was released last night after serving twenty months of a five year sentence. Paroled. Where's Shadow? - He's downstairs. He should be here any minute. Alright, that's enough. Scram. Sir, the guard of honor is all complete. Still cracking, huh? Some day you'll learn things ain't so funny. Okay, chief, anything you say. Any boys from headquarters been around looking for me? You know, chief, prison ain't agreed with you. You're developing into a worrier. They've got nothing on you. They got what they might have. It's not a year this time, no nor ten. It's screwed down under a lid. I can die quick enough without help. Oh, what are you talking about? You're the skinny kind tat lives forever. Yeah? He gave me a half of year... the doctor at the jail. Six months I get... and the rest, dirt. Six feet... - No kiddin'... on the level? Look, chief, I'm... I'm sorry. - But before that happens, many of these boys will know what it's like to breathe and have no place to put air. They will learn it from me. Call 'em in. Let's get going. What's the hurry? - I got work to do. Some college professor with nothing better to do started yapping about the Romagna case again. Oh, that... you got nothing to worry about. That's what I'm going to find out. If Garth Estress has talked... Use your brains. Why should he talk? He's in it too, ain't he? He can't talk. It's only dead men that can't talk. It might be safer if Garth was... - Yeah... you won't be happy until you've bumped off everybody you ever knew. That ain't a bad idea. Nobody cares about Romagna anymore. He had no friends, no family. There was a son... - Sure. Off somewhere, hoping nobody will ever find him. You don't suppose he wants it known his old man was burned for murder. do you? Just the same, I'd like to know where hi is. What brought you east? - I heard something. Same old business? - Yeah. There's a college professor turned up some new evidence. I couldn't find anything he had writtenq so I beat it east. I found this Professor Liggett's report. I think he has something. Sorry, boys, the soup's all gone. Madam, your story's an old one. We've heard it before. Yeah, soup's been gone in Seattle, in Los Angeles, in Tacoma, in Detroit. It'd be hard to mention a city in which at one time or another soup hadn't been all gone. That's that. - Yeah. Where now? To look for a man on an empty stomach. Who? Garth Estress. Garth. The glue lets go. It's the steam. It splits your hair. Can it be mended? - I can't mend it. Someone, somewhere would gladly mend it for a dollar. I'm glad to do it if I had a dollar. Got a dollar? No, I thought not. Garth, what did that lawyer mean that wrote to you? What lawyer? - I found this letter in your room. I thought I burned it. - What about this murder? Will you shut up little fool? - But if it's true what they say you knew all the time Romagna wasn't guilty and could have said so if they'd asked So far as I know, they'd never heard of me. You're a good kid, Miriame, but got too much imagination. I wasn't mixed up in any murder. If you hoped I had some criminal, romantic past, you'll have to look again. You'll excuse me for not knocking. Garth's home, I see. He might not have been here if I knocked. How are ya, Trock? I guess you can see how I am. Who's the girl? - My sister. Happy to meet you. Step inside a minute. We have something to talk about. No. When I say "go out", ya go. Go on. If you listen, I'll riddle that door. I just got out, see, and I pay my first call on you. Who started looking this up? You know as much as I do. It wasn't you turning state's evidence? The case was closed. They burned Romagna for it. Why should I look for trouble and get burned? I don't know, I thought I'd find out. Who wants to go on trial again, except the papers? We won't talk, and unless we did, there's nothing to take to court. You forget the judge. Where's the judge? What judge? - Read that paper. Judge gaunt's gone nuts. He's been going around proving to everybody Romagna was guilty, stopping people in the street to prove it. Nobody knows where he is. - Why don't they know? Because he's on those somewhere. They got the police of three cities looking for. Well, why should that worry you? He's crazy, ain't he? And even if he wasn't, he's arguing on your side. You're jittery, chief. You got the jitters. They'll give you away sometime. Now, don't jump the gun. I've got pockets in my clothes, too. Alright, take it easy. Maybe you're lying to me. Maybe you're not. Stay at home for a few days. - Sure thing, why not? When I say "stay home," I mean stay home. If I have to go looking for you, you'll stay a long time wherever I find you. Be seeing you. My son, who are they? Let's not stay here. I thought he'd come for something horrible. Is he coming back, Garth? - I don't know. Who is he? - Who is he, Garth? He'd kill me if I told you who he was. Then don't say it. - Yes, I'll say it. If I'm killed, you'll know who did it. He'll not get away with killing me. They'll pay for it. Promise and remember, I was with a gang one time that robbed a payroll. I saw a murder done and Trock Estrella did it. Remember that. Trock shot the paymaster. If that got out, we'd go to the chair. That's why he came. - But that's not true. That's why you've kept silent. - Well, I'm not silent now. I won't sit here forever looking at that door, waiting for Trock and his submachine gun, waiting for the police with a warrant. And what I'm thinking is, Romagna dead for the murder. Dead... while I sit here dying inside. Dead for the thing Trock did while I looked on. I could have saved him, but I let him die instead of me because I wanted to live. Well, it's no life... - It can't be true... My son, you're mad. Someone will hear... Well, let them hear. I've lived with ghosts too long... Oh, son, be silent. Don't take this last thing from me. It was little to keep even before, but now, my son... - Don't worry, I'll be quiet and live. I'll live even if I have to crawl. Is it better... to tell a lie and live? Yes, child, it is better. Pardon me, sir... but perhaps you could tell me the name of this street? This ain't no street. There, where the street lamp is? Oh that... that's the alley. - Thank you. It has a name, no doubt? - No, it's just the alley. I see. You wonder why I ask, I dare say? I'm... I'm a stranger here. - Yes, sir. There's nothing you can do. Your old man was a radical and a... dangerous man. I don't like to say it... - You're right, Carr. He was a dangerous man. Think of it, he believed that children shouldn't be forced to go to work, that a man should only work a reasonable number of hours a day. And when he was injured, he should have care and medical attention. That if he got too old to work, he should be cared for and not starve to death. Hey, have you gone crazy? Those things are the law. I know. And my father died 16 years ago. What's the matter, kid? Nothing. - Wait a minute. Yes? I'm sorry. I thought you were someone else. It's alright. Why do you look at me? You're unhappy. - It doesn't matter. You're unhappy, too. How did you know. Just looked at you. Can I help? - Thank you. In all the miles i've traveled, you're the first to offer me that. I mean it. Who are you? Nobody. Just a girl you saw among the tenements. Seems as if maybe we've met before. And maybe we'll meet again. Kind of cute. Just a kid. - That's just as well. The homely ones are bad enough, but the lookers are fatal. You exaggerate, Carr. Now look... come here. Somewhere in that deserted and forgotten corner of this highly advertised city may lie the answer to all my questions. Why don't you forget it, Mio? I said I'd follow the trail to the end. This may be it. You'll only get yourself in trouble. Lay off it. - I can't lay off. This thing didn't happen to you. It left you your name. It left me one thing only and that's to be my father's voice crying up out of the earth in the quick lime where they stuck him. And my mother... I tell you these county burials are swift, cheap, run for profit. Out of the house and into the ground, wait a minuteq there's some Romagna spawn left. Something crawls there, something they called a son. Ease him out of town, boys, ease him out, not too gentle or he'll come back. I will go back. Maybe I can sleep then or even live. Come in, my daughter. It's cold here. A storm coming. Soon, father, I'm just waiting. What's his name? Whose name? Why, when you are young and listen for a step, the step should have a name. It's the way you make your living. They've got no right to stop ya. No more music, I tell the cop. I've got to put him away, that's all. Then you'll have to go on relief, if there is any more relief. Relief, I don't know, but I can't play no more music. The policeman says no. Tomorrow I start. How about a tune, Tony? - Bet it won't play. Sure, she's a good little machine. Cost plenty money, and two new records. I only played twice, see? Come on, give it to me. Come on, I want to see you dance. Yeah, let's see you. Come on, shake 'em up. Dance, kid? Dance? Go on, do your glides? - Please. They're gonna get married, honest. Ain't it the most romantic thing you ever heard? Come on, let's dance. Tell me your name. - Mio. What's yours? - Miriamne. There's no such name. But there's no such nane as Mio. M- i-o? That's no name. - For Batalamio... Well, my mother's name was Miriam, so they called me Miriamne. Meaning little Miriam? Come on, little Miriam. Hey, you! Hey... you! What do you want? - Sign off. You mean I gotta go off the street? - Sign off! Hey, what's the matter with the music, Captain? Not a thing, Admiral. We had a little party going here. - I'll say ya did. Please officer, we want to dance. - Oh, go ahead, dance. We want music. - Sorry, I can't help you. There you have it. A perfect example of oppression in the land where music should be as free as air. and the arts should be encouraged. A uniformed dominion of the intelligente steps in and puts the limits of the innocent enjoyment of the poor. We don't go to theaters. Why not? We can't afford it. We don't go to night clubs where the women dance naked and the music drips from saxophones and leaks out from crooners. We can't afford that, either. But at least we can dance on the riverbank to the strains of an organ. Bravo! You ain't making a speech. You're coming down. Please I have my rights! - No speeches. You take hands off me! - You want to get run in? For what? I haven't done anything. One moment, officer. There is some difference of opinion, even on the bench, as to the elasticity of police power when applied in minor emergencies to preserve civil order. Say, who are you? Sir, I'm not accustomed to answer that question. Get down off your high horse. Who are you? What are you doing here? I'm a judge of some standing not in your city, it is true, but in another where there are similar statutes. My name... My name... That's strange. I knew it only a moment ago. I'll think of it again. - Why, you fool, you're crazy. Whatever they may have said or done, let them disperse in peace. It is better that they go softly, lest when they are dead, you see their eyes pleading and their outstretched hands touch you, fingering cold on your heart. I have been harsher than you. - Lay off, I tell ya. What have I done to be ashamed of? Tread on them! Tread down the aged and the infirm! Yeah, that's right. You don't have to step on the guy. What's the matter? I haven't stepped on anybody. There seems to be an opportunity for an ambitious young man. Wait a minute! Give the badge a chance. He's doing his job, what he gets paid to do, same as any of ya. Why, they're all picked men, these metropolitan police. They're handpicked for loyalty and a fine upstanding pair of shoulders on their legs. It's not so easy to represent the law. Think what he does stamping out crime. Do you want to be robbed and murdered in your beds? Hey, what's eating you? - He must be a capitalist. That's enough out of you, too, professor. I think you've handled the whole situation rather badly from the beginning. - You may not. For that remark I'll be satisfied with nothing less than an unconditional apology. - Oh, you want an apology, hey? You'll get one where you don't like it. Get out of my way! Come on! Don't stop me! - What are you trying to do... Get out of here! Wait for me. Get out of here. Get him inside, quick. - Who, son? It's the judge, judge Gaunt. Get him inside. Let us go inside. This is sleet that's falling. You will understand, sir. We old men know how softly we must proceed with such things. I'm telling you, I saw him with my own eyes. It's the judge, goofy as a bed bug. I guess you thought I meant it about waiting here to meet me. No, I'd forgotten about it till I got that slap of winter across the face. You'd better go in. I'm not your kind. I'm nobody's kind but my own. I'm just waiting for this to blow over. Wait a minute. I lied. I meant it. Yeah, I meant it when I said it. There is too much hate in me for any girl to know. Whay hurts you so, Mio? - I'm alone, that's what. I'll go with you. Where? - Where you go. You little fool, what made you say that? I don't know. If you have a home, stay in it. I ask for nothing. I've schooled myself to ask for nothing. I take what I get and get along. - Wherever you go, I'll go. Oh, Mio, take me with you and let them look for us, but we'll be away. Where? I have no house, no home, no love of life, fear or death. Why do you say that? Miriamne, when I was child, we climbed through an iron gate, my mother and I, to see my father in prison. He stood in a death cell and he put his hand through the bars and said, "My Mio, I have only this to leave you, that I love you and I'll love you after I die. "Love me then, Mio, when this hard thing comes on you which you must live a man despised for your father. " Lie still and rest, my father. I've not forgotten. When I forget, may I lie blind as you. What was his name? Your father's name? Batalamio Romagna. I'm not ashamed of it. Mio, why are you here? - Well, I can't tell you that. No, but there's someone lives here, lives not far, and you mean to see him, you... you mean to ask him. Who told you that? - His name is garth... Garth Estress. Were you sent to say this? You must go before you are seen or spoken to. Why? Will you tell me why? Because I live you. I... I can't tell you. Miriamne! Where will I find you when I want you? Never. I'll bring you death! Hey, you! Why are you still around here? Garth... - You'll wake him. You're not safe here. - What of it? If you slipped away and take a place somewhere where we can find you. Using what for money? Why do you suppose I've sat here so long? That I love my home so much? If I stepped around the corner, it would be my last step. But Trock will come again, and if you're here, he'll find you. Child, we can do nothing. The old fool, she's waked him up. I'm looking for a family by the name of estress. You will imagine how much more than galling I feel it to ask my way home, and where I am. This is New York City, or part of it. Well, sir, I shall lie under the deepest obligation if you can set an old man on his path. I'll put you on your way. Only you'd be wiser to wait awhile, if I'm any judge. It happens I'm the judge in more ways than one. Can I sleep under the pipes tonight? Can I, please? No, not tonight. There won't be any more nights if I don't get warm. Come in. Thanks. I must go. They'll be worried. You shall be well rewarded for your kindness. But at the moment, I'm low in funds. Your name, sir? My na,e is Estress and This is my son, Garth. Estress... Estress... Now, I know. Liggett, that's the name. He wrote some trash about you. I came to tell you it is purely fabrication, lacking fact. It's true I could have called you, but the case was clear. Romagna was known guilty and there was nothing to add. Don't worry, I'll say nothing. - Nor any of us. You understand, if there were any just end to be served by speaking out, I'd speak it. But there's none. Bear that in mind. - We'll be silent. Excuse me, but I'm looking for a man name of Estress, Garth Estress. Do you know him? - Estress, sure. Down there, on the corner. Thank you. It's Trock. - No, he wouldn't knock. May I come in? - Yes, sir. What is it you want? It's late. I might say that I was trying to earn my tuition fee by peddling magazines. I could say that or collecting old newspapers paying cash. Highest rates. No questions asked. We've got nothing to sell. You're fine, gentlemen. My business is not an ordinary kind and felt the need of a slight introduction if I might get my bearings. Your name is Estress, or so they tell me. - What about it? I'll be quick and brief. A man died many years ago for payroll robbery. You have some knowledge of this crime. Your testimony, if given, would clear him of any share in the murder. You may not know if he's guilty or not. You may not care, but I do care. I care deeply. I'm asking you face-to-face. To ask what? - What do you know about it? This man Romagna did he have a son? - Yes, sir. This man Romagna as you choose to call him had a son, and I'm that son and proud. - Forgive me. If my son can help, he will. At the moment we are busy. Tomorrow... - What I have to say won't take long. Tell me in a word what you know. Is it for him or against him? My son knows nothing. I knew some members of the gang there, and after the murder, they picked me up because I looked like someone that was seen in the murder car. They held me for awahile, but they couldn't identify me for the most excellent reason I wasn't there when the thing occurred. That's all I know. I wish I could tell you more. That the whole story? - The whole story. Well, I've come 3000 miles for this dead end. You liar. I won't believe it. My boy, if he was innocent, and you know him so, believe it, and let the others believe what they like. If you mean to say Batalamio Romagna was innocent, you're wrong. He was guilty. You lie whoever you are. My father was murdered. Romagna was found guilty by all due process of law and given his chance to prove his innocence. But who are you? How do you know? I've searched the records through the trial and what came after. And in all that million words, I found one unprejudiced argument to fix the crime on him. And you yourself, were you unprejudiced? Who are you? A face in a dream. The judge. The judge in the trial was younger, but he had your face. Could it be that yes... the jury judge. I sat there as a child I heard that voice. I watched that mouth. I knew even then, that you meant no good to him. Are you Judge Gaunt? I am. Why are you here? Because I'm an upright judge and want the truth. I've searched and compared and verified the transcripts of the trial. Without prejudice, no doubt. It was never in your mind to prove that you've been right. I'm conscious of that, too that that might be my purpose and still, I found no error. I watched all modern comment and saw it centered finally on one fact Garth Estress was not called. This is Garth Estress and you have heard him. Would his deposition have justified a new trial? It would not. My boy, can it not be and I ask this quite honestly, that the great injustice was on your side, not on mine? Can it not be true that you, who were touched closest by the tragedy, may not have lost perspective? - Do you think I'm crazy? Is that what you mean to say? Is it not true that wherever you walked, he's still walking by your side, sleeping only when you sleep, a shadow not your own follows, praying and holding out his hands to be delivered from shame? How do you know that? I don't know. Because one specter haunted you and me, and haunts you still. But for me, it's laid at rest, now that my mind is satisfied. He died justly and not by errer. Do you know that you've come near to death, that there is murder in me. There was murder in your father. It is to be expected. Yeah, you'd like to have me kill ya. It would prove your case. But you won't get that from me. You go home and die in your bed. My boy, I have read some things your father said, and you are a man fortunate in your father, whatever the verdict of the world. Come, judge, you'd better be going. I'll lend you my coat. A little rain shouldn't matter to me. It is freezing as it falls and you have a long way to go. Thank you, I'll manage. Well... Let me stay here a minute? Sure sleep here, too. You can have the whole row at the end of the pipes. You're going to thank me for keeping you out of this. I've seen men get that way, thinking they had to plug some guys and then a few more to cover it up, and then maybe more. You can't kill all witnesses 'cause everyone you put away's got friends. I said "alright. " I said "fine. " They're going to find that judge, and if they find him dead, it's too bad. I don't want to know about it and you don't either. You all through? Sure, I'm through. Alright. We're through, too, ya know. - Oh, yeah? Yeah. We're through. I heard that before, and afterwards somebody died. Is that what you mean? You can go. - Sure, I'll go. Maybe you don't mind if I find out what you've got on you. Before I turn my back, I'd like to know. Not that I distrust you, but you know how it is. So long, Gart. - So long. I won't talk, you can be sure of that. I know you won't. Mio. How did you get here? - I live here. My name is Estress. Garth is my brother. The walls are thin. I heard what was said. This is no place for me. - What place could be better? I don't know. It's better to go... just to go. But they can take away so little with all their words. It was bad enough that he should have died innocently. If he were guilty, what's my life? I tell you, I've lived by his innocence. I've lived to see that flash blind them all. But the truth, I wanted truth. Not the lies you tell yourself and tell a woman and a woman tells you. That judge may have told the truth. I may be mad. You must never believe them, Mio. It's truth that I believe in you. I love you. But you've never said you love me. Why wouldn't I love you? You're clean and sweet. I've seen nothing clean or sweet all these years. I love you. I'll leave you that for what good it may do you. Than kiss me. Goodbye, Miriamne. You won't forget? I won't forget. Excuse the interruption. I wouldn't want to cause inconvenience to any of ya, especially the judge. What's all this here? Who's that? He's a poor half-wit that sometimes sleeps there. Come out. Come out, whoever you are. What's your name? - They mostly call me Oak. What do you know? - No, sir. What do you pump? - I've got a piece of bread. Get out! But it's cold out there. - Get out. Who are you? I'm a half-wit, too. The difference is got no piece of bread. Another comic, huh? Who's he? - His name's Romagna. He's the son. What's he doing here? You said you were on the level. We didn't ask him. He walked in on account of the stuff in the papers. We are together. If we had Shadow, we'd all be here. Who's Shadow? Oh, so now you're putting questions. Shadow is just nobody, see. He blew away. It might happen to anyone. Yeah... anyone at all. Why do you keep your hand in your pocket? Because I'm cold, mug. Because I've been outside and it's cold as a tomb. Listen, there's a car waiting up the street to take the judge home. No way, Trock, he's harmless. That's not necessary. I say it is. - I want no hand in this. Anything happens to me happens to you, too, musician. I know that, Trock. - Keep your mouth out of it then. You better keep the mug here tonight, just for luck. Come on, Judge... your carriage. It would seem that you and the judge know each other. I've been around. Maybe you met before? Maybe we have. - Will you tell me where? How long do you want to live? How long? I got big ideas about that. - I thought so. So far I've got nothing against you but your name, see? You keep it that way. Keep your hands where they belong, Trock. I'm clean. You've got my gun. You said the doctor gave you six months to live. That's what you said. Six months... Well, I don't give you that much. Don't let him do it. Don't let him! Why, you rat, you put three holes in me and I'm back from the grave, Trock. Back to take you with me. Where are you? Trock, say something. Speak to me. I can hear you even if I can't see you. I get this far and now I can't see. The blood runs out too fast. Too fast. When you've got three holes clean through you... Tell me where he is, you fools! Tell me where he is! Take him out of here! Take him out, I say! He was dead. He's out of his grave. Can't they keep a man underground? No, he won't stay underground. He won't stay under water. Why did you have him killed? I didn't! Now, you can't keep them down these dead men. Stay away! - Because of you my father died. Keep away from me! - Wasn't it? Look at me! What do you want from me? - You killed the paymaster! You killed the paymaster! - You lie. It was Shadow killed him. It was not Romagna? It was not Romagna. There were three men involved in this crime for which my father died. Shadow and Trock, principals in the murder, Garth as witness, and whu are they here? You, the judge, why are you here? Because you were afraid, and drew together out of fear, to arrange a story to tell. This is I've hunted all over the earth to find out. I'd be blind if I missed it now. Alright, I'm talking. You'll get your father I guess. Will you see to that? - Yes. Me and some others. Maybe I lost my grip, there, just for a minute. That's alright. Good evening. We are looking for someone who might be here. There's the one I mean. Come on... There he is. What do you think? You should've known him from his pictures. Come along, Judge, you're going home. Thank you. I'm afraid... some sanity in my own silly way, but... I don't remember. Well, if it isn't Trock Estrella. How ya, Trock? - Pretty good, thanks. Hear ya got out yesterday. - That's right. You know we got orders to watch you pretty close. Be good now baby or back you go. - Sure. If we find any stiffs on the riverbank, we know who to look for. Look in the other room, then. I accuse that man of murder. Trock Estrella he' a murderer. Oh, I remember you. - What, Martin? Oh, sorry, the boy's a professional cheater. Took me over about a half an hour ago. Tips the police and then ducks out. Oh, yeah? - I'm not kidding now. You'll find a dead man there in the next room and Estrella killed him. Take a look. Listen, boy, you stood out there and put the booby sign on me and then ran away. Don't try twice. Any corpses here? - No, no. Not that I know of. - I know there's no one there. Think up a better one. Have I got to drag 'em out where you can see 'em? He's kidding you, Sarge. If the cadaver's here, I don't see it. He was in there. Trock shot him and they brought him in here. Sixteen years ago, Trock killed a man. - Wait a minute, son. When you make a charge of murder, it's better to have a corpus delicti. He puts in fire alarms to see the engines. What have you done with him? - I don't know what you mean. What's he talking about? - I wish I could tell you, I don't know. You better watch yourself, chump. They're in it together all of them. Is it you? You've dreamed something, that isn't truth. You have dreamed something, but truly, there was no one there. Do you want me to say it? Yes, I was dreaming it. I was dreaming it. I'll say you was. Let's get going. Come along, Judge. And if I hear anymore out of you, I'll run ya in. Got a coat? I'll lend you mine. 'Night, folks. Where's Shadow? - In the river. Is he out this time, or still around? He's dead. - That's perfect. Keep the mug here a few minutes, then let him go. I have plans to make. Stay in the alley, out of sight. I'll watch up on the bridge. If he tries to pass, I'll give you a signal then shoot. That's the same by me. A shout would bring the cops and there's no way out. I'll be cornered. You got a silencer, ain't you? No cop will be able to hear. The noise won't even carry to the square. Suppose he goes out the other alley. Louie knows him. He needs no identification there. Remember, when I signal you, shoot. What signal? - Something you can see. A light. Look, I'll light a coffin nail... like this. And shoot to kill or you may find yourself swimming beside Shadow. They're climbing up the bridge. You must go. Hurry, while it's still safe. - You heard what Trock said. He stays here. What do you mean? He means to kill him. You know that. No doubt Master Romagna can run his own campaign. But he'll be killed. - That's his business. No, no, it's mine. Where have you two met? We danced together. Then the dance is over, I think. Garth, I've always loved you and I've tried to help you. You've been kind. Don't spoil it now. - Spoil it now? I love him. - Why did you lie? He's my brother, Mio. I couldn't give them my brother. No... you couldn't. It had to be you... my sister, whom I love... I didn't know it would happen, but... But we met and the world's all changed for me. Garth... you brought this to nothing I wanted done. Let him go, Garth, for me. Go ahead. Go tell your story. Only, watch your step. I warn you Trock's out gunning and you won't walk far. My son, this Trock deserves to die. No one defends him. But his crime, this same crime that has dogged yoy, has dogged us. If there is lower to go, he'll go there when you've told your story. Oh, my Mio, you said you loved me, but he's my brother whom I love. Bright, tyrannical gods. What fun they have in heaven. When a man prays hard for any gift, they give it to him, then one more to boot that makes us useless. You might have picked some other stranger to dance with. I know. Chosen some other evening to sit outside in the rain. It had to be this. All my life, I've wanted only one thing. And now you thrust a girl's face between me and the rights I've sworn the dead, you'll have 'em. You ask too much. Your brother can take his chance. That parts us. I shall say what I have to say. Mio! Wait for me! Don't you go without me! It may be that I won't go at all. This kinda takes me off my high horse. I was nearer right than I thought when I said I'd come to a dead end. You must go inside, Mio. - No. I know you don't trust me, and I haven't earned your trust, but I'll call the police to get you safely off. When the police come, they'll ask questions, and when they're answered, they'll ask more. But before they're done, your son will be implicated. Must he be? - I shall not keep quiet. I make no truce. - Still, I'll go. I could love your father. Miriamne, if you love me, change me from what I am and have been till I learn to live like a man. Teach me how to forgive and forget to hate. He would have forgiven. - He? Your father. My father? Yes... You may think it strange, I've never remembered that. I tried, but he won't let me past. He kicked me back three times. I swear, I did what I could. He's waiting for you. Child, save yourself if you can. There might be some way up through the house and out across the roof. Come in, and let me look. - I'll stay here. Once inside, I'm a rat in a dead corner. You look for me, if you don't mind. - Then watch for me. You two get inside. No and be cornered like a rat? No, thank you. - I'll silence him. I'll get you safely through. - He'll kill you, Garth. Forget it, Miriamne. Now I'm not afraid to die not if Trock dies, too. I'm tired of hiding out in ratholes, and when I'm gone, you may have a chance. Maybe with him you'll get some place. He seems determined enough. - No! I heard a sound, like a slap. Wait here. Garth? Trock thinks of everything. A silencer. That's why we heard nothing. Strange... I should feel sad and cry and yet I don't. The shadow hovered over him so long. His death mustn't be in vain. Mio, you must get through! - I know. How long to climb? - The stairs are steep. Should I follow him? - Wait. He waves you to go back... not to go in. - There's some way out. We can't be cornered here. You go inside. You'll be safe there. Now, all you silent powers that make the sleet and rain, but never yet have spoken give us a sign. ...yet calls for mercy with the rain. We're two lovers here in your night and we wish to live. We made our prayer to the gods, Miriamne, but they wouldn't listen. Why didn't they answer? They have! They sent us this! Mio! Alright, young feller. You started something once too often. I warned you about that herdie-gerdie. Now, you're history. - Those heard our prayers. They sent us a sign. Welcome, messenger of the gods! You are the sign. Oh, the kiddin's gonna start again, huh? - Officer, he's... Arrest me. Take me to a station hose, where a man can talk out loud. Call out the guards, get more of your sturdy cards. I want a guard of honor on this momentous trip. You're going to get it!
