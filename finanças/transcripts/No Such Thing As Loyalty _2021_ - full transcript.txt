Are you calling your boy to see if he all right? No. He'll call me if something wrong. Mm. I'm about to go in the house, have a drink or two and relax. What you all getting in to? Shit, I'm taking my ass home. Tonight was just too much for me. I feel like I need to be hiding or some shit. A bit too paranoid right about now. What the hell? Ain't no body ready to go home, I'm not ready to go home. Listen, you think we can hang out and maybe you could drop me off later? I could use a company right about now. So I'm good with that. Darnell, don't be trying to hump on my girl the first night either. Shit, he better hope I don't hop on him, the first night. Shit, don't threaten me with a good time. Mm. Boy please, you ain't getting none of this. Listen, I need a chat friend and my life has not been peaches and cream, so. No can y'all get out of my car with all their sentimental shit? Whatever girl.

If you don't really smoke, then I won't smoke around you. But if you don't mind? Wow. That's nice of you. Most guys that asked me that, you know, really don't care. Like the last guy to ask me if I smoke and I said no, not really, he said fuck it, more for me. I ain't seen that fool since. Yeah, that's too bad for him. That man didn't know how to be a gentleman. I know, right? But listen, go ahead. Spark up. That's okay with me. I only smoke cigars, now. Ah, cigars, okay. Well listen, thank you so so much for getting us out of that club safely. Like, I was scared as hell. No problem, you know, due to my man fuckery, I had to make sure y'all got up out of there safely. Mm. You know, shit could've got ugly real quick. Yeah. J could be a real dangerous dude. But in his defense, those guys started it. Yeah. I'd give you that, you're right about that. But are you okay? I'm good, I'm used to this shit. Oh. So enough about all of that, tell me about you. Absolutely not. Ladies first. What's your story? Let me see. I lost my job, my car broke down on me today, I want to go back to school, but I have no income, so I don't know what to do. Yeah, that can be stressful. Tell me about it. I feel like my life is on a downhill spiral with no breaks. Like, a fatal crash is about to happen. What do I do? Get another job. Get another job, that's jokes. You sound like you need a Superman. Huh, where you at? Where you at? Can you fly on in, hurry up and come save me? Where you at? What if he's already here? Oh, what did he want? I got my super powers. Listen, okay okay okay. You got a lot going on here, doing pretty good for yourself. What's your story? I have my own problems as well. I just make it look good. Yeah? Well I'm here, listening ear, want to talk? The way I see it, we're both looking for the same thing. So what you trying to do? No, I'm so not in a position to be in a relationship with anybody, I can't really take care of myself, let alone take care of somebody else. I feel like the only way I'm going to get out this hole is if I get back into school, you know, and if a Superman wants to fly in and pay for my tuition and my school and put a roof over my head, so be it. I'll be his superwoman, no questions asked. Be careful what you ask for, my super power's dope. About that, can you take me home please? To my soon-to-be-ex-apartment, if you don't mind? I'll tell you what. I'll take you home. In a few days, pack your stuff up and you can move in with me, as friends. I have more than enough room, and don't worry about paying rent. You ain't got no money! There you go with the jokes again. I'm just saying, I'm not trying to be funny tonight. Not funny. But I'll help you get back into school and we can get your car fixed as well. Are you serious? You cannot be serious. You just met me tonight, you're willing to do all of that for me? Life is about taking a chance. I ain't afraid to take a chance. Besides, I think we'll get along just fine. I'll tell you what. Give yourself a little time to think about it and get back at me in a few days. All right, deal, deal. Wait a minute, aren't you worried about your friend what happened to him at the club tonight?

I mean damn, I just wanted to hang out. Get a drink or two, maybe? Is something wrong with that? Yo, knock it off the man. Aw. Hey, let me tell you like this, man. You're playing a dangerous game, yo. Yo, that's my word, you definitely flirting with the wrong nigga right now, man. But I'm gonna make you a drink though. Oh yeah? Well, tell me who's the right one I should be flirting with right now. What the fuck kind of question is that? Don't you got a man named Darnell? That's who the fuck you're supposed to flirting with, man. Darnell's not here right now. You are. Yo, you deadass, huh? Well you know what for real, man. This kind of shit should have been from the jump go. That is true, but boy, bye. You was out here shooting people! But I must admit you was the first one I had my eyes on. But you know your boy Darnell came through when I needed him the most. You don't listen, man. Fuck all the none sense, though. Take this drink. Thank you. Let me throw it to you like this. We've been around each other mad long, man. I see how you been staring at me, yo. You might as well go and let me do something to that. Ain't nobody got to know nothing. I won't tell if you won't. You definitely don't like to tell, so what's popping? You know what this is. You're right, I'm not the telling type. So what's you trying to do me? How bad you trying to find out? Hmm. I got a couple of hours. You got a couple of hours? Mm-hmm. ♪ Caught up in the light I'm falling. ♪ ♪ Drifting to the night I'm all in. ♪ ♪ Drifting in your tide wave falling. ♪ Yo, where this damn girl at? I'm about drunk as hell right now. Oh no. Her phone's still going straight to voicemail. She had been coming in late lately. I don't even understanding this shit though. I don't know what's wrong with my girl. But she's been acting real funny lately. Well, at least I'm not the only one seeing that shit. I don't want to think of the worst of this situation. But I don't know right now. I don't think she cheating, D. I mean, she know if it wasn't for you, she wouldn't be in the position she's in now. Well that's true. She pretty much owe you her whole damn life. So let's not get ahead of ourselves. All right. Ah, shit. What's up, babe? We sitting here worried about you. I called your office, you're not there. Just called the cell phone, that shit's going straight to voicemail. What's up? Don't start. Not right now, babe. I had a long fucking day, I'm tired. I want to get out of these clothes, take a shower, get a drink and go to bed. Are you okay? I'm tired. Hey, can you give me a drink real quick so I can get out of these clothes? How about you make your own damn drink and come over here and tell me where the hell you've been? Babe, I had a meeting in downtown that lasted a couple of hours and then I had a couple of drinks with some coworkers. I didn't even know my phone was dead until like a few minutes ago. Something just don't sound right about that, Erica. You didn't think to call home and say, hey, I may be a couple hours late. I don't want you to worry. What the fuck? You know what? I'm going to the store, fuck this! You need something, Rachel? No, I'm good. I'm about to get ready to go in a minute anyways. Why you gotta be rude about it? Whatever, man. I got to go with D on this one. Now, you're my friend and everything, but that story sounded real suspect. I don't give a fuck what you think. Why are you here with my man anyways? You're joking, right? Bitch, you're trying to play me? Erica, if it wasn't for me, you would've never met Darnell. Don't try to flip this shit just because your ass ain't up to no good. You don't know what the hell I'm doing. The question is, what the hell are you doing alone here with my man when I'm not here? Let me explain something to you. I don't know where this is coming from. But to better fix it. Now what I do know is Darnell brought your broke ass in and gave you life, put you through school, and helped you get on your feet. Now that you're little up top, you're acting real fucking funny. You better check your shit before someone else do. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what's wrong? Your bitch is what's wrong. As usual. Excuse me. You forgot your coat. I'll get it later. Shit. Yo, what the hell is going on with you? Listen, I'm going to tell you like I told her. Why is she here alone with my man when I'm not here? Have you lost your fucking mind? Rachel was my friend way before you came along and she'll be here after you gone. We've been together all of this time and you got a problem with this now? Yes I do. No women should allow another woman in her house when she's not here with her man. Erica, something's ain't right with you right now! You come up in this motherfucker mad late with an attitude like you got something to hide! Don't make me check your face! You know what? I don't have time for this and I have to take this from you.

Wait, you got something you want to say to me? I just told you. I don't trust him. And you really need to watch him. Especially after what he did that night at the bar. I haven't forgotten. He didn't give a damn about our safety or our wellbeing. Why do I feel it's more than this? You got some say, spit it out. J's been my boy since we was 10 years old. That's not just hood love.

You all right? I'm good, man. Just going through it. Oh shit, here we go. Shorty been out here mad funny lately. Crazy distant. I mean, to the point I'm comfortable enough to say I think she's cheating. And yet, I still don't have no sympathy for you, D. I told you about this shit, man. Why you think I treat these hoes the way I do, man? I ain't looking for nothing. I'm just saying, all this shit that I did for this woman, I bent over backwards to make sure she's where she's at today. And I feel like if a nigga gets no appreciation, no cap, my motherfucking feeling's hurt. Shit. What- Fuck! What the fuck are you looking for? I'm looking for some fucks to give, nigga. But I just can't find them. I told you, I warned you about this shit, man. You still going through this shit, man. The fuck, D? Come on. I'm saying what I feel. I don't even know if this shit is really true, but I guarantee you I'll get to the bottom of this shit. Listen, I wouldn't be surprised if the bitch ever tried me the yang yang, nigga. You know what I mean? It's always somebody out there better than a motherfucker you're with, D. And if that nigga come at your bitch, then she's good as God, homie. That's what you call fucking, that's what you call creeping, that's what you call friends with benefits. All right, I get your motherfucking point. I'm just saying, as long as it's not you. Oh, come on man. Come on, man, because that shit would be fucked up on so many levels. Listen, man. You're my man. If your girl threw me the pussy, I'm going to take it, my nigga. And then I'm gonna let you know just to prove your bitch ain't shit. And then, like a real man, you can dump the bitch and move the fuck on. Don't do that. Because that shit's still wrong. I expect that shit from these other niggas out here, but not you. Nigga, we ain't street friends. We actually rock together. We break bread together, nigga. We bust that motherfuckers together. So let me find out she ain't shit my own way, not yours. What the fuck ever, my nigga. Good, because I wouldn't do that shit to you. Listen, man. Just know bitches ain't shit, and you'll be fine. Anyways. I gotta to finish this shit up and go play my numbers, man. I'm fucking a jackpot a $150 million. God damn, the fuck are you going to do if you win, man? Hey, I'm bouncing.

Very funny. I'm about to go play that shit too, motherfucker. I'm gonna break your ass a something something. As a matter of fact, I'm about to go now before they run out of tickets, nigga. You know how the motherfucking stores do, man. Let me finish this set and I'll meet you over there. All right, man, I'm out. I'll meet you at the store, man. All right. I grab you a cup of coffee or something, nigga. You're fucking Gatorade the way this shit's going. Girl, we need to talk. Hey. Hey. Listen, I don't know what we went wrong at, but do was out of place. Now you've been my girl for years and for you to come at me like that was real fucked up. And why the hell was you going to James' house in the middle of the damn night? Listen, I was just releasing some steam and it's not what you think. And at the same goddamn time, I'm a grown ass woman, Rachel. What the hell was you doing? Spying on me? Girl, please. You heard your ass past me. I thought something was wrong, so I followed you. So wait, nothing is wrong with your car? Bitch, I have a 2020. I wish something might be wrong with my vehicle. But the point of it is, I needed your help. I called you up and you played the shit out of me. All right, all right girl, listen. I am sorry, all right? I was just confused about last night. Can I tell you something? I'm listening. I love Darnell. But I can't do this anymore. He's not the man for me and I know he has helped me out a lot. No Erica, he has done everything for you. He pretty much gave up his whole damn life and this is how you want to treat him? See, this is why I keep shit to myself. Because you was wrong, and you was wrong the other night. Regardless if I'm wrong or not, you know me for years and you know how I am. I don't want Darnell. He's not my type. I want to be on my own and do me. Is that okay with you? And besides, another man's got my heart. And before you say anything, I know Darnell is your friend, but I don't want him anymore. Another man's got my attention now. You know what? Karma is a bitch. And Karma is going to bite you in the ass. And I want to be around when it happens. But until then, you take care. Now get the fuck out of my yard, trick bitch. Whatever, I got my own shit to be in anyway.

What's wrong with you? You're usually touchy, you're feely. You're acting different, what's wrong? Listen, we can't do this no more, yo. Do what? This. I mean, on some real shit, this shit is like, killing me, eating me up inside we be doing this to my boy, man. This nigga really love you. Eating you up, huh? Eating you up? You had no problems when you was eating that pussy. It wasn't bothering you when you were doing fat. Boy, you better not leave me. Leave you? Bitch, we was never together. We was just fucking. And like I said before, man, I knew you wasn't shit when we first met. You know what- What the fuck are you talking about? Fuck you, yo. Fuck you! I can't believe you're doing this to me. Fuck out of here, man. Listen, I need you to get up out of my room, man. You know what I mean? I know I'm wrong. I know I'm wrong.

You want to treat me like that? I'll leave. Ain't this the same shit you did to Darnell? They call this Karma, yo. You need to learn from it, man. Get the fuck out of here, yo. Yo, fuck you, James. This bitch crazy, man. The fuck am I gonna tell this nigga, man? Hello, 911. Yes, I would like to report a club shooting a while ago. Yes, I know who did it. Yo! Hey, you look a mess, you okay? No I'm not okay, look at my nails. I went to get it done, and the girl broke my nail and now they're closed- All right, all right, all right, relax, relax, relax, relax. I'm sorry. Relax. I'm so sorry. But anyway, listen. I just wanna say, I'm sorry. For everything. Yo, don't worry about it. Listen, I got some good news. Yeah? I sold the business- You did what? You sold the company? Yeah. What the fuck? We have no income? You know what, I know you don't think you can live off of me. I knew I should've left your ass when I started to. Now how are we supposed to live? See, that's the problem when bitches don't let niggas talking. Bitch, shut the fuck up. Why is you here with my man anyway when I'm not around? Your man? So tell me. Is Darnell your man or is James your man? Because I'm real fucking confused. Did you really go to James' house to release some stress? Or to release a nut? Or maybe it's the other nigga you said that got all your attention. What the fuck is she talking about, Erica? Well, since it's out in the open, Yes. I've been fucking your best friend, James. And that's why I haven't fucking you for over a year. Damn, a year? I don't even want you. Yo, what the fuck have I been done to you? So you can't even answer that question? Because I ain't never do shit! I just don't want you as my man anymore! And how the fuck you're not telling me this shit? You're supposed to be my friend! I didn't know how to tell you! I didn't want to choose between who I thought was my friend. Fuck all of that. You have no job, no company, how long do you think that money's gonna last? You know what? That's why I like of aggressive men like James. You're a fucking cornball. Oh my god. Okay, you know why I sold my company, Erica? No Darnell, enlighten me, why? Besides the offer that I couldn't refuse, I fucked around and hit the lottery for $150 million out. That's what the fuck I was trying to tell you before I was rudely interrupted. I also was about to tell you to go pack so we can start over. But I guess I don't have to do that shit now, right? Boo. Now that's some Karma for your ass. Bitch, you should've stayed loyal. And you can have James! You motherfuckers are good for each other, and you need to go get that cough checked out. Because you probably got that shit from him. All of the fucking bottom feeders he's been hitting? Yeah. So, what I want you to do is get the fuck up out of here before you spread that shit around here. I am so sorry. Listen, I was just lost and confused. I didn't know you still love me anymore. Can we please do what you said and start over? You sure as hell is sorry. And hell no y'all ain't starting over. Darnell, no, please. Please don't do this. Please. Rachel, I should have done this a long time ago. You've always been the one for me. I never made the move. So what's up? You got with your man or what? Darnell, what you talking about? Yes Darnell, what are we talking about? What I'm talking about is, come with me. It should've been me and you from the jump. Come with you? $150 million? Fuck yeah! It's about time you manned up. No! You're not about to be with my man, bitch. Get off me! Get off of me, bitch! All right, all right. Just leave! All right. I'm gonna kill two birds with one stone. Y'all are not going to play me like this! Yeah, , worship me, right? All I need is a fucking statement. So what I'm saying basically is, y'all better give me half of that ticket. You know what? Fuck him if you want to, I always get what I want! You don't get shit up out of here today! That bitch is crazy. Listen, I'm not wasting no more time in this city. I need you to go home, pack your stuff, take whatever you want, but I gotta holler at James before I go. Let's just go. Leave him where he's at. If she tell, we're all going down. Because she was there too. I know, shit. She can actually play the victim and act like you threatened her when I say shit. I'm gonna tell you what, she'll be all right. Trust me, just go back. Okay, I'm gonna get the hell up out of here. That's right. Yo, yo I need to talk to you, man. No, I need to holler at you now, bro. All right, cool. I called you man, a long ago, man. What's happening? I need to put, I got three trucks, man. I need to put them in your motherfucking garage. Come on, shorty, stop playing. I'm gonna holler back at you in a minute. All right. What's good, man? What's so important you had me rush over here, man? What's popping? When the fuck was you going to tell me? Tell you what? You said, if you ever gave you the pussy, you was gonna tell me. Man, I've been meaning to tell you- Nigga, did you just put your- Huh? Because I thought a nigga that just got punched in the face said something. Don't play with me, I'll kill you with your motherfucking gun. Nigga, you beef with me for some pussy, nigga? Pussy? This ain't about pussy? It's about loyalty! It's too bad it took two pussies to expose that shit. Nigga, I don't give a fuck about none of that shit. I already told you how I got down, nigga. I told you I don't give a fuck about none of these hoes out here, or a man. Now what, nigga? So you don't give a fuck about me? When it comes to pussy, D, I said what the fuck I said, what's popping? Besides, man. Come on, man. I thought you changed your life anyways. Get the shit out my face, the fuck is wrong with you, man? I don't know pussy, D. You know what. That bitch ain't worth shit, man I told you that shit when we was in the club. This belong to you. The fuck is this about, man? I'm about to put this motherfucking shit in the rear view. Our friendship? I'll start a new chapter, too bad you won't be in it. And speaking of loyalty, that grimy ass bitch threatening to go to the police about the club shooting. Yeah. Tie up your loose ends, nigga. We can't have that now, D. And if I was you, I'd get rid of that motherfucking gun, too. Handle your motherfucking business. And get the fuck up out of my house. All this over some pussy, D? This how we're going down, nigga? No, nigga, it's about loyalty! You know what, I'm going to handle that shit, man. I had no hard feelings with you about this bitch, nigga. I'm about to put her in the fucking ground, man. Do what you go to, now get the fuck out. It's only pussy, D. Come on, man. You got that though, let me take care of that. No hard feelings, D! She's gone! Bitch, I'm about to get that nigga with no loaded gun. On to the brighter side of today's news, very own Jackpot lottery winner, $150 million. I'm standing here with my personal friend, Darnell Greene, And let me tell you, I'm so excited. I feel like I won the lottery myself. How do you feel and what do you plan on doing first? Excited. Oh, wow. Being that I come from a tough background, tough neighborhood, tough upbringing- Trying to fucking play me, nigga? It allows me to help someone else. So I have a couple of non-profit organizations- Trying to make it seem like it's over, bitch? Had me do your dirty work so you can live in La La Land? And up to the cigar lounge for a bottle of scotch? And a nice cigar. Okay, sounds fun. Back to you. I'm coming to your doorsteps, nigga. I'm about to re-introduce myself to you. You owe me, D! Fuck!
