Hello? Hello? Hey, your phone doesn't work! Where's sweetie? Where's Sweetie? Can't you call Sweetie? She won't fly in till her fee is agreed. Didn't you discuss it? She wants to discuss it with you, face to face. Suits me. I make money... without too much work. It's easy! THE PORNOCRATS - Are you really a pornocrat? - Yes. You make a living from pornography? I do. A good one, at that. Place yourself better. I am. Get lower! - You'd have to enter me first. - No, that's the point. - Pornocrats, 13, take 3. - Shit, I'm coming! What's going on? - It won't go in? - I don't think so. - Is this better? - Yes. - The erection's good? - Yes, Claudine's great! And she has a reputation for being castrator... It's the opposite for me. Look, she's not bad there. - He says it's not bad. - Is it good? - Yes. - It's hard to get hard for a camera. Let's listen. She's laughing there, see? Just a bit. - Comical. - There's too much on him. - Is that OK? - Maybe we'll redo it. We'll redo it. - Wow, she's smutty! - Watch out. Can we listen? Jean-François Davy, you made many independent films when you started out, and suddenly, you specialized in writing and making erotic films. How did this come to pass? First off, I'm not specialized. I'm known through erotic films because they've been successful. The others weren't. And second, it didn't happen suddenly. It was due mostly to financial circumstances. I was in deep shit. I couldn't do a film I wanted to do at the time, which I made later on: Threshold of the Void. I had financial problems and the only way to resolve them was to do an erotic film. My first erotic film was Dirty Lovers, and I made it before Threshold. Then I did Threshold. I was in deep shit again after I made the film, and I really made Erotic Escape to get out of debt. I'm very skeptical of the genre. I don't know if the erotic genre really exists. Take Erotic Escape, for example, which is 90 minutes long, there are 15 minutes of sex scenes. If you take out those 15 minutes, the film could be shown on TV. That's good, see? It's good. It's getting hard. Erotically, you need to be shorter. That's true. He has his mouth on her skin, you hear... That's not normal. - Cover your mouth with your hand. - We'll try. I had 10 more or less happy years acting in the theater, but I had made practically no films. Maybe I got into films through the theater. And it was an erotic comedy. It was just as a joke! I couldn't see myself doing erotic theater, sex scenes... it gave me the chills. That's how I got into what they call erotic cinema. Yes, go on... Do it again... Get the drift? Yes. It's the actors who make love. They're told to concentrate. That's really stupid. Love can also be happy, agreeable, nice! Frédérique, look at me! - The other way! - The other way, yes. Porn is automatically synonymous with a bad film. It's as hard to get naked on a set as it is to say your lines with feeling. When you want to show something strong, you have to do it. The audience pays so you have to give them a show. So the word "porn" bothers you? It's what it implies that's troubling. For an actor, having a reputation for only doing porn is hardly a mark of fame and glory. So I saw this man. And I saw his theater, which was pretty. And the guy seemed pretty nice, too. He called 2 weeks later, I did it... I didn't have to audition. We started rehearsing. Until the day we had to go on the set, naked! And not only be naked, but also pretend to... pretend to make love. To mime it. It wasn't so bad. Miming isn't bad. Harder than doing it? Yes! Because then you really have to act. Would you do it if there had to be penetration and ejaculation? I don't know if I could. This is what I have to say about things... Shit, the thing came out! There's no more thing! Would you appear in a film like this, with a plot and all, requiring scenes with homosexuality or sadomasochism? - Would you still appear in them? - Yes. As long as they were necessary for the plot and advanced it and not if they were added in gratuitously. Is this a realistic scene? No, not at all. Not doing it like that! No. It's funny, but it's tiring, huh? - OK, that's it for today. - If you want. Thanks. - You were great. - Oh, that's nice of you! Well done. OK, come on. A film is something with many players. There are the partners, of course, there are technicians, and there's the director, which, in this case, is me. I don't consider myself to be a director, more like a provocateur. What is a director for you? - We've been together all day. - I'm waiting for him to direct me. Charlie, Charlie! It's a boss, like if I worked elsewhere. He says: "Do this, do that. Move to the left, the right..." "Move over a bit..." He's a guide. He's everything, he's not a director. He doesn't scare people. - He's not a dictator? - No, he's not. He shouldn't yell at the actors. I've filmed with directors who've yelled at me. It freaks me, I can't get anything out. At times I've not been able to act anymore. On the other hand, some are friends, and everything works great. - A kind of complicity? - Yes, that's important. Muriel... One of the gorgeous things a man can see is a woman caressing herself. I think a woman's beautiful when she's masturbating for the camera, or for a man. Caress your breasts. Arch your back, move your body. Lie on your stomach. Yes, move your hips, your ass... Caress yourself from behind. Faster, harder... Yes, cry out! Struggle... Harder, faster! At times, we are what the boss says: Right, left, turn, your ass! Now we film more in lions' cages, the guy is there, he's the cage, that's it. You're glad to leave at 6, and you shouldn't be. It depends. Some like this genre. They know how to make the girls and guys comfortable. We do anything for them. If they ask us to fuck on a ladder, we will. - While some others go: "One, two..." - It's kinda fascist. Caress yourself faster, harder. Very fast... very fast. Go on, harder... Go on, again... Give us the orgasm. Show the orgasm. You feel your orgasm coming. You're gonna come... You're gonna come hard. Yes! Jean-François, a visitor. Meet Mr. Lion. - How are you, Mr Davy? - Well. - I caught you working. - Yes, we're filming. These are my 2 new discoveries, Christine and Chantal. Mind the step. Sit down. Take your places, ladies. It's been quite a while. So, these are my two fillies. They've had a good start, too, made several films. I hope you'll give them something. Yes. They've worked? They've been in several films and also did some commercials. They're not rookies. Do you know what kind of film we're making? They know, yes. Are there things they can and can't do? Are there any limits? - No. - So, no problem. - No problem. - You talk to me, as usual. 1,000 francs. That's the going rate, I believe. - 1,000 francs per contract. - Do you take a commission? The usual commission, 10%. - From the 1,000 francs? - From the 1,000 francs. - That's reasonable. - It's reasonable. I'm a reasonable man. Been in the business a long time. Is this a profitable business for an agent, an impresario? It's unquestionably profitable. You were a pilot? A fighter pilot in the Air Force, then a commercial pilot. - And a boxer? - When I was young. Christine, the first time you were in a porn film, how did you react? It didn't bother me. It didn't shock me. She was fine, she wasn't traumatized. - And Chantal? - Uh... I refused at first. - At first. She was reluctant. - I refused... I didn't want penetration... there were things I refused. And in the end, I saw... that this worked the best, that I had more chance of success in this field. These young girls need to eat, like everyone else! They need to earn a living. But I do try to have them do other things. Which doesn't mean that when they do a good film, even hardcore, with a top director like you, it doesn't mean I'm not happy they did it. The Pornocrats, 11, take one. The Pornocrats, 12, take one. Perfect. So, these are my two fillies. They've had a good start, too, they've made several films. Lie on your back... I hope you'll give them something. You're good to me, so I think you'll find both of them a role. - Yes. They've worked? - They've been in several films. They also did some commercials. Caress your breasts with the other hand. They had classes. They aren't rookies. What acting classes did you take? - Yves Furet. - Oh, yeah... It's where I discovered them. Do you know what kind of film we're making? They know, yes. They know. - Faster. - Did they see Exhibition? They saw Exhibition and liked it. These films don't scare them. They're very with it! This is a film about... It's sort of a reportage on making erotic films. Erotic films, yes. We want to show a bit how they're made, - and the people who participate. - Who participate, yes. - Two sensational actors. - Yes? Pretend you're having an orgasm, arch your back... - And as far as... - 1,000 francs per contract. I'm reasonable. Chantal, you're an actress, when you're asked to masturbate or do a lesbian scene, you don't seem to enjoy it. No, not at all. It's really just cinema. We're making movies. Jocelyne... before the interview you said: "If my father in the Antilles sees this, what will he say?" In the Antilles, it's frowned upon to do porn. It's due to the influence of religion there. I don't like this kind of exhibitionism. Then why do you make erotic-pornographic films? Same as everyone, for money. Why did you come to France? To study. - To study what? - Accounting. - Accounting... - I'm still an accountant... - You work as an accountant now? - Yes. How did you start doing movies? I dunno, it just happened. I wanted to be an extra to make some more money, that's it. And they kept proposing... Not being an extra, just porn. At first, I refused. But my boyfriend urged me on. He said: "Look, do it, I don't mind." And I've been doing erotic films ever since. Do you want to become an actress? Yes, of course. When we start in this business, we dream of making it really big. When you do porn, you're totally typecast. - Typecast? Really? - Yes, I think so. You can't do anything else? I'd like to, but I think not. The camera, photos, lights... It's... It's just that. When you adapt to that, everything else continues in the same way. Do you think that doing pornographic films can be liberating? Did it lead you to have interesting sexual experiences that you wouldn't have had otherwise? Yes, yes... For example? Well... with a woman. You'd never made love to a woman? No, never. Do you now do this in your private life? My boyfriend brought over a girl. He said: "Try it." I did, and it wasn't bad. I like it. Sigh... Every image is erotic. An image of a phone, of an ashtray, can be erotic. Images in cinema are erotic. Being in a theater with moving light is. The light. Look at the actors. Actors are eroticized by the lights on them. I feel that, as a critic, you're more interested in this genre. Are you specialized, as a critic, in erotic cinema? At first, I became interested in film for chaotic reasons, then more in avant-garde, with some psychoanalysis, and what really made me understand this was meeting Michel Caen. We spoke, and I suddenly realized that whether a film's good or bad, erotic or western, what are the criterions? What does good or bad mean? What's a film? I must admit that despite some snobbism, which first led me to see Bénazéraf, as people talked about him, I didn't go to erotic films. Michel Caen took me to a hardcore film. I saw Behind the Green Door, a masterpiece, as good as a Hitchcock film, and it's a porn film. That was 4 years ago. And since then, I personally consider erotic films in general to be fascinating for critical research. I'll go further: critics who don't study erotic cinema aren't doing their jobs. Fetishism is linked to this, too, because when you like film, you start collecting images. You collect, say, books on film, and gradually progress towards eroticism. Now there's something new. This is a vital period. Guys who went to a movie of a train pulling in were sexually excited by what they saw. But as that seemed strange, they said: "We'll add women." So they did. There was a justification for an erotic obsession. Then they added men for drama. And so this drama only prepared people for total voyeurism. They rid themselves of a possibility to act. What they saw on screen, which wouldn't be done in a western, a mystery or a comedy, is direct sexuality. Showing male or female frontal nudity is considered sometimes to be rather shocking. But no one is shocked to see erotic mouths. Therein lies the key. You want to possess an image, to penetrate it. It's hard to penetrate an image. In the US, in 9 out of 10 hardcore porn films, where you see everything, what happens? In 9 out of 10 erotic scenes, are fellatio scenes in which we see a mouth actually sucking a dick. Why? Because the desired penetration subconsciously exists in a face we don't know how to penetrate. There's just one orifice through which to sexually penetrate a face: the mouth. - I can't really see. - Well, look! We can't see anything. Well, look! Place yourself so you can see. OK, I'll go beneath them. Now I see everything. Is she doing a good job? Men like it better when we don't hold them. Just the mouth. - That's what they say. - Why's she pushing? - No, don't hold him. - Why are you pushing? Answer us. Why're you pushing? A girlfriend has a special way of blowing me... I'll explain. She doesn't move her head. She puts my cock in her mouth and only works with her tongue. You really get off! A bit of hay. Rachel always cleans up! Don't bite, OK! She could get a mouthful! But some guys like us to take in the whole dick. - To the throat. - As far as we can. - Sometimes I retch! - Yes, but it's good. - That's when... - Yes, that's good! Great! - Yes, you see... - We're talking! This is how I learned to blow. Claudine Beccarie gives great blowjobs. You do it best. The way you suck, it doesn't show if the guy's not hard. - Really? - Oh yeah. It's very professional. Great work. Look how she does it. She sucks. You think we're always hard. I don't always suck. I move my tongue too. Yes, but you suck too. Some girls do this, look. I know what I'm saying. I taught my sister on my fingers. So she takes the willy. Willies are soft, sometimes, ugly. You see? She takes the willy and then... She takes the willy, like so. It goes up and down, it's never hard. I've nothing in common with Carmelo. Some guys like you to suck, others don't. Some like touching, others don't. Or the anus. It's all part of fellatio. - Exactly. - Yes! Many women touch anuses, but many men won't let us. So I was surprised she said: "I don't worry about the guy." I'm not challenging you, but saying you don't worry about the guy... What do you mean I don't? You said you just do the same thing, you don't bother to find out what the guy likes. - That's not true! - You said it! OK, fine. - She said it! - You're talking for me. Great. She thinks I'm challenging her. I think it's ridiculous. She's ridiculous. Completely and utterly ridiculous! Let me introduce you to Paul Vecchiali. He's directed three films. Three independent films. You're a top university graduate. And you just directed a movie that could be qualified as being an erotic film. I recently spoke with people who know you well, they said: "We don't understand the change. "What happened to Paul? Why's he doing porn?" With scorn. Not so much scorn, they don't get why Paul Vecchiali is doing porn films. Can you explain? No. I've no need to justify myself. You say they know me well? They don't. What's intolerable is, 10 years ago, spy films were popular, and no one would have said: "Why's Vecchiali doing a spy film?" So you see the racism people have and can't get rid of. But I won't use that alibi. I did this film because I wanted to, and, what's more, I'm totally in favor of porn films. I think the most disgusting, sordid so-called porn film, like My Sister's Hand or something, is 10 times more important now than a Sautet film adapted by Dabadie. Jean-Christophe, there was something that surprised everyone. There was a sequence in Paul's film where there were four of you, two men and two women. At some point, the women separated from you. They took care of each other, which didn't bother anyone, and you took your partners cock and sucked it, which floored everyone, especially because it wasn't scripted or asked for. - Why did that happen? - Well, uh... Why not? No, I mean, he had a great cock and it was right there. You can see it in the film, suddenly. It was an opportunity to seize. It's astonishing it surprised people. It reveals a lot about... our male chauvinistic society. Because it was OK for two women to do a female homosexual scene, but not for two men to do a male homosexual scene. You must accept that we're doing an erotic film because we're exhibitionists, and eventually because... it can bring us sensory pleasure. I'm speaking for myself, but... When you pretended to strangle Chantal, you played it realistically. You didn't really want to strangle her, did you? In some ways, yes. I mean... Maybe. If we lived in a country or civilization where murder wasn't absolutely reprehensible, lets say in situations such as Marquis de Sade depicted, you'd strangle her? Yes, if we lived in such a society. With pleasure? Oh... maybe, yes. So you think murder is a sexual pleasure? Yes, of course. But that's nothing new! Showing yourself like this, as you do, and accepting this, isn't there something that's linked to exhibitionism? - You are an exhibitionist. - Completely, of course. Seeing and being in erotic cinema has given me satisfaction, as it's an immense pleasure for me to show my ass and my dick exactly the same way I love showing my face. There are a sufficient number of people who project themselves in me that are voyeurs themselves, but are also closet exhibitionists who dream of being in my place, showing their dicks. For you who watch me, who listen to me, I'm the token fag, that's how it is, but who are you? "Non-homosexuals", perhaps? The question isn't if I'm a homosexual or not, it's knowing what you are. Women! I'm here! You're mine! I'll have you all! All! You'll all be mine! All mine! I'll fuck all of you! I'll sodomize you! All of you! Go on! Penetrate her! Hi, Carmelo! So you're an actor specializing in hardcore? Yes. That's right. What does it mean, "actor specializing in hardcore"? For me, an actor specializing in hardcore is, well, say, the new... How do you say it? How can I say it? I'm Italian, you know. Words don't come easily for me! Hardcore? Let's call it true pornography. I think that's it. And can you handle doing what they expect you to do? I mean, permanent virility? Well, it isn't permanent virility. We'll say I can keep up my maximum. Do you have much choice in terms of costume and physical appearance? I think I do. I hope you'll be happy with me. - Can you give us a demonstration? - Yes, of course. Do you do both hetero and homosexual scenes? Yes, absolutely. Which do you prefer, personally? So far I've mostly worked with girls, right? I've worked with girls, but as we're in hardcore now, working with men or women is the same. I really have no... I'm pretty open. - Can I take them off? - Sure. Can you get hard easily? Easily... I'm not exactly an exhibitionist. No. I always worked in music. I made some records, they didn't work. But I've worked in the arts since 1956. And I've done well. Does this give actors the chance to express themselves as actors? I don't do this because... Thinking I'll be a Marcello Mastroianni, no, that's not my case. But I make a living, by trying to not spend too much money. I think of tomorrow, because it's here. Do you think you can easily get a hard-on now? No. Honestly speaking. If we want to film a hard scene now, what will we do? We'll have to cheat. Or I'll have to masturbate well! I'll have to play a film in my head! - I can! - Can you try? - Yes, I can. - Go on. - May I? - Yeah. Christine! Go on, blow me! Yes! Come on, blow me! Go on, blow me hard, sweetie. Here! Take it all, sweetie! It's all yours. Go on, sweetie! Go on, sweetie! Blow me good, sweetie! Blow me good! It's yours! It's yours! Go on, blow me! You're gonna make me come! I'm gonna come! Does it scratch or tickle? Is it different with a beard? Jacques, you differ from most actors we see on hardcore sets, because you've been acting for years and only recently began these films. A year ago. And you've been acting for? 10 years. Basically I'm a professional actor and most of the money I make comes from the theater. And you're paid to do this? I don't understand! 10, 20, 30, 40, 50... I can't continue. Again! Is the agent's commission included? He doesn't have one. I'm a technical stage manager. I do a lot of tours. I've done many theater tours, children's theater, cabarets and poetry. And here I am doing porn films. How does a cabaret and theater actor get into porn films? I'm very primary about that. I need one thing: to show myself. Horrid bitch! Here! We're paid the same to do something and you refuse! See, that's Clockwork Orange. I must show myself. I'm an exhibitionist. Seems I have a nice, round ass. - Not only sexually. - OK. I'm an exhibitionist, that means... The first film that I did was just to make movies. I'm a voyeur, too. I like watching. The money's important, because I know the filmmaker makes some, so I want to as well. It's my job, so I have to make money, but when I made my first film, I wanted to be in movies because I'd never been filmed, I'd never been on a set. I got 10 days of filming, which, for a first film, wasn't bad. Frédérique, it's not always good to say too much. To speak frankly of some filmmakers who give you work... I can't speak frankly about them because I work with them. - I can't... - What do you think of them? Look, I said I couldn't answer you! You're cracking up! I'm not going to intimidate you right now! Wait, it came out... - She's crying! - Not up my ass. No, no! Don't worry! I can't answer, I work with them, because I earn money and all... They know that's the only reason why. As they make shitty movies and I know it... I say: "You want to make money, so do I, business is business!" - Really? - Yes... - Does it feel good, Frédérique? - Great! You just saying that? - No, not at all! - I'm glad. It's different with you. It's not the same problem. But that's how it is with them. I don't want to talk about it. They just make crap. I just want to know if you're hoping or trying to become an actor who does everything. In this genre and in others too. I'd like to, but I get don't get any offers, so I do this. If I get other offers, I'll do them and stop doing porn. Unless I find a cool director who has an interesting script, well filmed and with reason. "Nudity if there's a metaphysical reason." That is ridiculous! Actors can be so stupid on this subject. Explain that. I argue with people, and don't hire them in the end. They say: "It depends. "I'll show my ass, my dick, or my pussy, "as long as there's a reason..." If we show it, there's a reason! They need a reassuring context to give them a sense of security It's monstrous! Come in. Sit down. So, we had you come in when we saw an ad that appeared in "Flash Contact" magazine, saying: "Young Martinique girl, beginner. "5 feet 5 inches. 120 pounds. 32-25-35. "Black, frizzy hair, brown eyes. "Seeking extra work or role in erotic films, commercials, "or figure modeling" Yes. Why did you run that ad? Because I saw that ad in a Laundromat one day, and it prompted me to run one. I'd wanted to be in films for a while, to try to see if I could do a few films. So, as it had occurred to me, and I'd seen the ad, I went to call "Flash Contact". They met with me and asked me to pay a certain sum. And I need money, I don't have much. It's hard to find work. So it would have helped to do a few films to make some money. - Have you been in films before? - I was in one. In October. And the person with you is your husband? Yes. - You have kids, I think? - Yes, 2. - They're at their grandma's? - Yes. They're waiting for you to finish and pick them up? Yes. - Have you been in films before? - No. Never. It's my first time. I'm slightly intimidated, you know. - What do you do besides this? - I'm a janitor, and I work in insurance. And, I get by pretty well. - And you? - I work in a hospital in Paris. We'll try it. This is practically the first time we've met. Please undress. We'll film an erotic scene on the bed next door. OK. So get undressed. Hurry up, if you can, because on screen, obviously, it always seems a bit long! The technicians don't bother you? No, not at all. Lie down on the bed. - Undress completely. - Really? Or we'll see your briefs and it won't look real! - Maybe later. - No, take them off now. - Take them off now. - OK. Or we'll have trouble framing, it's hard to hide. Lie diagonally. Your head up there and your feet here, so you're perpendicular to the camera, it's prettier. There. Now kiss each other. You need to go faster in films than in real life, or it seems too long. We can put on some music if you want. - Yes. - It's easier that way. You can start the music. We have the 1st sound recording. - Do you want to hear it? - Yes, of course. Go ahead, Michel. When you asked if we wanted music, I immediately thought we should have put it on right away. When we got on the bed. André, lie down. André, lie on your back and Laure, got on top of him. Do you mind me directing you on set? Not at all. Laure, straddle him. Good. Arch your back. And throw your head back. More, all the way back. André, tip her back on the bed, like this. Straighten back up, André. Straighten up. OK, stop the playback. That's enough. I think we're done. Can you come tomorrow - to get your check? - Sure. I suppose you need it. Of course! So come tomorrow for your check. - OK. - How much was it again? It's what we agreed on. We said 500 each. - Which makes 1000 francs. - What time can we come? The accountant gets here at around 10 am. He's here from 10 am to 7 pm. We'll come in the afternoon. I can't say exactly when, I have a busy day. - Bye, see you soon. - Bye. - Bye, André. - Bye. Goodbye. - Your name? - Jean. I'm Rebecca. 193, take 2. - What's your name? - Jean. I'm Rebecca. 193, take 3. I'm Rebecca. Take 4... Take 5... I'm Marie-Madeleine. I understand that. I understand. Can you give me a present? - I have no money. - What? - I want to die! - No, stop! Calm down. I've nothing left! I've nothing left! Hello, Marcel? Bring me up two specials and wine. Thanks. Come on. Won't having Claudine Beccarie hidden among all the actors in The Pornocrats be seen as a regression by the audience? Regression? I don't always have to have a leading role! You said many directors hesitate and are scared to cast you now. They don't just hesitate, but they keep offering me porn films, although their egos are so big they can't get through the door. When I tell them my price, one I think I should ask for now, they get quiet because it upsets them. There's a director who asks for a girl, me, in this case, and they don't dare say they refused to pay my price. It's a bad situation, I don't know where this will end. Hello, Marcel? Bring me 2 specials and wine. You have to realize that being an actor in pornographic films is much harder for men than for women. When you come to a production, they ask you: "Do you have problems getting hard?" If there has never been a problem, you say: "Not so far." If you say: "We're going to do an erotic scene," no guarantees. - Chamois. - I think his penis is... - Chamois. - All dicks should be like this! - Interesting! - In other words, it's your size? It's not only my size, it's pretty. Hello, Marcel? There could be something you're not even conscious of that will hinder you. I'm getting soft! Hello, Marcel? Like earlier, Charlie and I were in the small room, and you were filming. It was OK. Come, Siren of mine As in old times Forage, my dearest In my hairy forest! And even just coming here can distract people. It was just to make them laugh. - No more laughing? - No. - OK. - This is serious. - Serious! - It's work! It's certainly harder for guys than it is for girls. Is that because of me? You said it was your size... it's him, he's traumatizing me. Meanwhile, I'm getting hard again! Is this a contest, or what? We don't always like it. Sometimes we have partners on the set, if your partner is laid back and compatible, she'll help you get ready, but I've heard of actresses, I haven't met them so far, the girls say: "It's work! "If you want to get ready, go jerk off and come back! "I'm just here to fuck and get paid." Some are like that. I prefer to always work with the same people. A group of the same partners. You know, 4 or 5 I often work with. Because, to do a good scene and feel confident and relaxed, I need to have intellectual contact with my partners, to have them be like girlfriends, you know? And in those cases, there's no problem. But otherwise, generally, when I meet a partner on a set whom I've never seen before... - A perfect stranger! - At times we don't know their names. It's not important, but still. It's not the same, I feel... Do it doggy-style. I think: "Who's this guy? What does he want? "Why does he do these films?" I'm afraid of something in erotic films, it pisses me off. Some guys are freaks, they come to fuck you and look. It's true, I've seen it. Get on top of him. Lie down. Get on top, facing the camera. It's so unpleasant for an actress. You feel like you're being raped, because we do a job and try to do it as nicely as we can. Stomach in, arch your back. So seeing these guys who come to get an eyeful... It's disgusting! The directors shouldn't let them in. Arch your back. Turn around, Rachel... Face him. Oh, you're horrid, Jean-François! Throw yourself backwards. Yes. Move your body... No, no! So, was that for the camera or for pleasure? Pleasure! We started out in the other room. - So it was really good? - Oh, yes, yes. - You weren't acting? - Not at all. - I didn't bother you? - Yes, a lot! I'm hot! - Did you go all the way? - You mean did I have an orgasm? No, I rarely do. That requires love. Charlie and I like each other. We're good friends, but we don't love each other. - And you, Charlie? - It was really intense! The camera blocks me in that area, and I can't come. That's why I'm good at porn... This morning wasn't great, but I can do it all day long. The hardest thing for me is when they ask me to come. Some guys can't get it up, but I can't come. I'm a great fuck with cameras! It can last as long as you want. - Is that better? - Yes, ma'am! The wine wasn't great. They have great red wine downstairs. You're sweet, but I have to work. Yes, OK. I understand. I'm going. Wait! You'll catch cold. Here, wear this scarf. Do you know your lines now? - Can we film? - Yes. Wait for me to say it! Come on, make love to me. Cut! - You have to keep it! - I would've taken it back. - I didn't say "cut". - I thought it was done! He doesn't do it very well! I feel really uncomfortable, and yet I've almost nothing on! Take off the pants, at least! Don't do it like in films where they fuck with pants on! Did you give me an impotent guy? - No erection, Patrick? - No. And I'm plugged up! That's the inconvenience of chicks in porn films! And use something else next time! There's fur everywhere! It looks like I'm graying! This is the color of tampons. I'm not complaining, but it's a pain! I don't care about your dick. - Good. - That's not why I'm here. And I didn't come for your internal charm. Well, you can't even get it up. Showing off? Hey! He's gonna get smacked! Richard, Liliane, you're married, 2 daughters. And besides these films? I was a secretary. He was a sales manager. And now you're a porn actor. Isn't is a bit easy? Yes, some people think so, but... let's say that, for me, working in front of a camera means being as serious as when I was a manager. - Is it paid better? - That, too. We did the first films because... I could get an erection, I was relaxed enough to be able to do it. And now, we're aiming for something better, like really acting. So you mean that this way of getting into films, which is a job you like, will eventually allow you to become real actors. Do you consider yourselves to be actors now? - No. - I don't like that word. We're more or less actors in life, but what's being an actor? We may take classes this fall, but for now, we're just filming with different directors who taught us how to behave for the cameras, to speak, to act, etc. So you got into movies through porn films? We started out with erotic films. We learned to act on the job. If a filmmaker or director notices me or thinks Liliane corresponds to a role due to her physique or temperament or something, I don't think it would be cause for objection. Before meeting Richard, Liliane had a quiet life. - A real softie. - She's very romantic. That hasn't changed, but she's seen more now, things that are more... real life, practically. I think that also being... being very comfortable, especially in the porn world, is being aware of things, it's a job like any other. And there's also our family life, which must continue. Ready, gents! Ready! Don't you think it's unethical to paint naked women for a living? Sure, it's unethical. Unfortunately we can't stop. We must do it, or we'll close! But the ads outside are stupid and pointless. The people who go to erotic films, which are all the same, go unthinkingly, hardly looking at the ads! But they're nicer to paint than some old actor's face! Do you go to see these films? No, I've never seen one. Why's that? I don't see the point. Maybe because they're all so ridiculous and stupid! - You're against eroticism? - No, but it's pointless. I don't know, maybe some people like seeing... Certainly, just look at the profits. Lots of people go. I wonder who goes. Most people say: "Never seen one!" As an usher it's better for us, too. - Financially? - There are more people. They say eroticism's over, but that's totally wrong. Audiences may even grow, because people are more disgusting. They don't care. Pardon my terminology. They come: "There's fucking!" Well, there is. Ladies, gents! Want to see a film? Come into the theater? It's because it's warm, it's not for the film. It's cold outside. There are always some mugs! We have to fill the theater! Sir, will you answer some questions? Are you going to see an erotic film? Are you going to see an erotic film? "Is your film good? Disgusting? Can we come?" "Yes, sir." - "Nudity? We see everything?" - "Everything!" Have you ever had an old customer dying of a heart attack? No! Just the opposite, they come back to life! And if I were the boss, I'd price the first ten rows at 3000 francs a shot! I turned on the light, they were making love, in the theater, in the last row, right next to me. - A couple? - Exactly. And she was wearing pants! That's hard to do! Are there problems in the theater? No, much less than with westerns! I always say, never take a newspaper off the floor! What do you think of the films? I don't really have an opinion, you know. For me, a good film is a good film... - Can I go? - Go on. People come at all hours? All hours of the day, in the middle or at the end of films, as they're shown in a loop. - Do some see a film several times? - Yes, they do. Do some come regularly from week to week? The same clients usually come back each week. Some of those that come here may not be able to pay for a woman. And others who, when things aren't working, come here for lessons. And why not? So what if something in their relationship is off, and they think seeing these films may help! Do we really know? No one ever really talks about their lives. When it's the same film, do people pick parts they like and come see them again? That, too. - There are? - Yes, yes. I wouldn't pay 10 francs to see it. You feel you've wasted money. - Its all porn and no plot! - Right. Some erotic films are good, but not these. Why? Can you tell just by seeing the posters? - It seems obvious. - The title? The girls? The title stinks of a rip-off. It's no good. - Is the title important? - Yes! Even if the film is bad, we'll get them in as long as the title's sensational. I'd rather see a good western. - You go to movies often? - Yes. - You go see westerns? - Yes, westerns and adventure films. What do you think about people who see these films? They're idiots. It's pointless. - Why do you see erotic films? - To pass time. - Do you often see erotic films? - No, but I have 90 minutes to kill. - Are they usually disappointing? - I dunno. Do you think they go far enough or not? Far enough. They're good. Not so far, but... but they do a good job with them. - Have you seen those photos? - Yeah. - You like them? - No! - They don't excite you a bit? - No! They're stupid. Personally, I don't care for them. Do women ever come alone? Yes, those women... they come looking for something, and they find it. No problem. 15 minutes later, it's done. They got what they wanted! I like adventure films, westerns and all that. I prefer James Bond films. I like vampire films best. - So, you're for them? - Well, I'm not against... I'm not really against them. But I'm not for them either. If people start doing naughty things, what do you do? If it's a whole row, it wouldn't bother anyone! If there are 5 seats, and all 5 of them work it out... Well, you know! It's a shame erotic films are generally oblivious. And not just erotic films! 75% of French filmmakers have no political awareness. It's a shame. There's ambiguity, because showing sex on screen is, in itself, positive, but it's badly done. We've bypassed great new filmmakers just because they were out to make money. We don't care whether the reason they came into film is pure or not. The first widely distributed Bergman film dubbed into French was the porn film Monika. Our problem as filmmakers is to make subjects that interest us coincide with what we can do. Same for me as a producer. Right now it's relatively easy to find the tens of millions needed to do a film if it's a film about sexuality or deals with sexual situations. So we have the tendency to do those subjects, you see. Are eroticism and porn are different? I think the difference lies in a cultural notion, a class notion. People think eroticism is noble. It's an intellectual or literary interpretation of sexuality, whereas porn is simply disgusting. I think it's a class notion, I see no difference. French films and Western films in general have been guilty of Puritanism for 50 years. "Correct" filmmakers didn't go beyond certain situations. And then came the surge of the erotic wave these past few years, which is indisputably excessive, but I think it influenced all films, great filmmakers and great films. And today, certain filmmakers... Not Bergman, as he was one of the first to show heavy sex scenes, like in The Silence. But I'm sure many great filmmakers won't make films now like they did 10 years ago, and will show things they wouldn't have dared to then. I'm totally in favor of porn films. The most disgusting, sordid film is 10 times more important now than a Sautet film adapted by Dabadie. Take off the pants, at least! Not like when they fuck with pants! Beginner. 5 feet 5 inches, 120 pounds. 32-25-35. Black, frizzy hair, brown eyes. Seeking role in erotic films, commercials, or figure modeling. That's how I got into what they call erotic cinema. Why not? I mean, he had a great cock, and it was suddenly right there: an opportunity to seize. The money's important. These young girls need to eat, like everyone else! They need to earn a living. Suits me. I'll make money... without too much work. Both tongues, both tongues... It's easy! Jocelyne, caress yourself at the same time. - You're really a pornocrat? - Yes. You make a living from pornography? A good one. Business is business. That's it. They're very with it! As long as they were necessary for the plot and advanced it. The audience paid! Pardon my terminology. They come: "There's fucking!" - There is! - Wonder who goes? Most people say: "Me? Never seen one..." It's as hard to get naked on a set as it is to say your lines with feeling. I don't do this thinking I'll be a Marcello Mastroianni! I do it for money. - Why did you come to France? - To study. What do you do besides this? I'm a janitor and I work in insurance. We learned to act on the job. - Are you a bit of a voyeur? - That too, yes! They're nicer to paint than some old actor's face! - Do you know your lines now? - Hello? Marcel? It's Erica. Critics who don't study erotic cinema aren't doing their jobs. Men or women, it's the same. Children's theater, cabarets... and here I am doing porn films! And there's also our family life, which must continue. I think we're done. Can you come tomorrow to get your check? I'm not really against them. But I'm not for them either. I don't want to talk about it. They just make crap. Subtitles by Courtney Kolar
