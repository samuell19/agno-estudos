My love. Come here, my love. Kiss me, my love. Stop. Can I get a ride'? - Sure. Twenty pesos on Juan. Pedro Esalvati and Juan Delatruix... Two champions who will do anything to win. Pedro Esalvati and Juan Delatruix. They're ready. We can start the battle. Pedro is in the ring. Twenty on Pedro. - Twenty on Juan. Come on, Pedro. What are you doing'? Attack, Pedro. Hit him. Come on, Pedro. Come on. Hey, Sara, you like violence'? Vincent. What are you doing here'? - What do you mean'? I'm gambling. And I bet you're here in Santo Domingo for work'? No, I'm on holiday, I'm taking a break from the newspaper. How much did you bet'? - Twenty pesos. And how much have you lost? - Me? No, I won quite a lot, look. I bet on Juan, he looks like he's in good shape. Come on! Come on, Pedro. Another ten. Ten. He's has had it. Don't waste any more money. You see'? - Damn it. "Juan is the winner." Pity, it didn't work out for me. If I'm not mistaken the last time we met you said you'd call me'? I'm still waiting. - Me? You're wife found out, I didn't need the hassle. Well, my wife's in France now. Then let's have dinner together, I'm staying at the Dominicus. Me too! How come we never met? My car's here. - It's yours? No, not quite, it belongs to the company. Sure, I'm a sporty type but I'd never buy something like this. Still no sentimental commitments'? No. And you're staying here until the power station's built'? More or less. Come here. Are you impatient'? There's a water bed in there that's like a flying carpet. Always the bed, you should've been an accountant, not a geologist. I find comfort is more pleasing. That's all. Now, if you'll permit me, I'm the impatient one. No, I'm all wet. - Where'? Come here. Check out the bed. What a mattress. Vincent, it's too not, do you have something to drink? Anything you want. - Do you want one as well'? Yes. Me too. Sara, what's wrong'? It's horrible. Sara. Hello'? Call the police, hurry. Room 215. Who's there'? Are you new here'? - Yes. Did I frighten you'? What' s you' name'? Excuse me. I don't need this anymore. He left around twenty days ago. You didn't have any further contact'? - No... We were all convinced he'd gone back to America... ...for his divorce. He'd asked for a month's leave. Still, it's all very strange. The manager confirms he didn't check out. Yes, that's right. Shall we sit here'? We can talk more easily. There's no sign of him checking out anywhere... Reception says he hired a car on the day... ...that you say he left for the States, Mr. Vincent. That's all we know. Sara. Come here, dear. Good morning, lady. - Good morning, inspector. Sara Ressel, inspector. She was with me when I found Dean's body. Enchanted, lady. Sara, the inspector needs to ask you some questions. I hope I can help. - Thank you. But I doubt it, you didn't know Mr. Dean, right? No, I think I saw him in the hotel once... But I don't know anymore, I'm sorry. In your opinion, inspector... Why did they put his body in my room'? Am I mistaken, or did another engineer from your company... ...lose his life in a car accident some time ago'? Yes, but I don't see the connection'? Me neither, for the moment. But if there is one... The person who put the body in your room... Wanted to give you a warning. We'll look into it. Stick around. Yes, of course, even if I don't understand your reasons. I'm just saying that, in the eventuality that we... How can I put it'? 'Find the connection', that's it. Don't worry, and you as well... This kind of thing doesn't arouse much interest these days. You're a journalist, right'? - Yes... But I'm on holiday, inspector. Not everyone likes to live next to a nuclear power station. Yes, but to physically eliminate the staff seems excessive. It's more likely that Dean got into some kind of trouble. But he never spoke to anyone, so... so, a corpse just turns up in your room, is that it'? What do I know'? Let Montenegro deal with it. Montenegro'? - Yes, the inspector. Let him do his job. Shall we dance'? No more talking. If you ask me, this could all be about drugs... What was he like'? - What do you want'? Do you want me to repeat the report I sent the company'? He was a regular guy, he liked women, rum... And he smoked normal cigarettes, he might've chased after the Creoles... But that isn't a crime. It might be interesting to know why he decided to get a divorce'? Don't you agree'? - But I didn't ask him... It didn't interest me. - Why? Why'? Because men, unlike women, mind their own business. Are they following us'? - Yes, since we left the city. Then try slowing down, let's see what they do'? Because if they overtake us, it means they aren't after us. Let's try. You were right, race enemy. Don't try to be smart, I could see you were scared. Yes, I'll admit it, I was scared. Can't I be scared'? Well, I was scared. You're forgiven, where are you building this power station? We've chosen a great place between the mountains and the sea. Not far from here, but what is this'? A professional investigation'? Just curious. Hey, look. She's brave. In this heat, and the little traffic that passes... She's in danger of becoming melted chocolate. She works at the hotel, let's give her a ride. Yes, sure. She's the most beautiful creature I've ever seen. Hi, want a ride'? This is my friend, Vincent... He's staying at the hotel as well. What did I tell you'? You weren't exaggerating. - Come on, get in. My name's Papaya. Papaya? What a funny name. And what's your name? - My name's Sara. What a funny name. I'm going to Las Veltas, my village. - But we're not. Let's take her there, is it far'? It's in the place where we're going to build the power station. Okay, we'll take you there. But tell me, Papaya, what's a beautiful girl like you doing in a place like that'? There's a party, all the villagers will be there. It's not the round stone festival? - Sure, just like every year. I always thought that story about the stone was a joke. It's natural, our traditions don't exist for you whites. Just stories to bring in the tourists, but it's not like that for us. Calm down, I didn't mean to offend you. Will you explain or do I need to get off'? Yes, it's a type of Macumba or Voodoo... It goes back to the Incas. They all gather in front of a stone, a round one, naturally... And they go wild, but no one knows where the stone is... Hey, Papaya? You know, why don't you tell us'? That's my business. Papaya's right, Vincent... The whites don't seem to care about local customs. Sure, but we bring civilization, let them care about tradition... They're all usually the same anyway. The round stone probably started out as a sacrificial altar... They sacrificed a goat on it at one point... Then another one the year after, and there's your tradition. No'? Take the next right, it's quicker. At your orders, because you don't talk, you command. But that's fine with me. Hey, they're my friends. Stop for a moment. Are you in trouble'? - Yes, it won't start. Do you know anything about cars'? - I can try. This is Ramon. - A pleasure. And my friend, Manuel. - Vincent. Hot, isn't it'? Drink this, it will help. Nice, thanks. Are you going to Las Ventas as well'? Sure, the festival is great, everyone around here is going. My name's Ramon. - My name's Sara. There's the problem, it was loose. It won't take long to fix it. The geologist is quick, we don't know much about cars... We hired this car to go to the festival, thank you. See you round. Goodbye. Papaya, are you coming with us'? - Why not'? It will save them the journey. - Why'? Don't they like parties'? No, you know... - They don't believe in the round stone. No, to be honest... Look at this. - What a strange amulet. It really is strange. - I know him... His name isn't Ramon. - And he knows you. He knew you were a geologist, he had an ambiguous smile... Arrogant. Right. Vincent, where are we going'? Guess. Festivals in ghettos are the same everywhere... Only the colour of the locals and the temperatures change. And the name of the saint, sometimes. - You're right. I wonder what happened'? - What'? To the saint? No, the round stone. Tell me what happened to that wild ancient ceremony'? What are you now'? An atheist? I told you, it's a load of rubbish. Festival, they call this a festival. Look there. - Where'? Over there. - Who? It's Papaya. - Papaya'? Yes, there. Look. I think she wants us to follow her. Come on. She's disappeared. There she is. It will be difficult to catch up with her with all these people. Let's go, hurry, or we'll lose her again. Let's try over here. You have to go that way. - Okay, thanks. Let's try. Do you want a papaya? - No, thanks. Where are they waiting for us'? - Over there. Waiting for us'? - That way. The blue house, go inside. This is the old part of the village, I've never been here before. I have a feeling a thousand eyes are watching me. How come you've never been here before'? You said you're building the power station next to this village. You know, this part of town is a bit like a Chinese district. Well'? Chinese districts are usually only for the Chinese... I mean, either you go in a group... Or you'd better stay at home. - Sure, I feel safe with you. Look, this must be the place. Shall we go in'? Let's go in. What's going on? ls this some kind of joke? Speak up. - Aren't you here for the party'? We're looking for a woman called Papaya, do you know her'? Yes, of course. - Well that's something. Can you tell us where she is'? You have to carry the flowers. Everyone carries flowers. You understood, right'? - No, absolutely nothing. I ask myself what there is to understand'? Apart from the fact that someone's trying scare us. Evidently, the round stone festival, the real one I mean, exists... But it's held in secret, you told Papaya you didn't believe it. So, she's inviting us to participate. In her own way, it seems, but it's still an invitation. You think too much, that's why you're a journalist. Do you know how they usually define these type of invitations'? Think what you want but I'm going to keep looking. Don't you hear anything'? - No, nothing. It's coming from in there. - But it looks uninhabited. Let's have a look. We've been expecting you. Looks like we finally made it, Sara, do you want continue'? That's a question I should ask you, I want to have a look. L don't like it, they're all drunk and on drugs. Let's get out of here. - No, wait. You must drink. What could it be'? - Let's try it. Vincent. Vincent. Where are we'? - I don't know. What happened'? I don't understand. Sara, we need to get out of here immediately. We're not in Las Ventas anymore. This must be... Yes, it must be Ocho Rios. It's not far from Las Ventras, they're all fishermen here... They all had to leave because of the power station. What do you mean'? - I mean all the people here... ...used to live in the area where we're building the power station. We knocked down their houses and gave them these in return. And they accepted'? - They protested at first... And then... - Then, nothing... Then they forced us, take it or leave it. Stay here, or be homeless. All in the name of science. Who brought us here'? My friends, Why? ls that a problem? Now I understand, you were there too. Tell the truth, behind one of those masks. Don't tell me you didn't notice. Ramon and Manuel were there as well, right'? You see'? She noticed. The children's school has already been organized... It can hold more than sixty students. - Good. Pedro's been to Cuba for the social organization... And he can be an instructor. - Sure. Everything must be... Ramon. You can get the journalist, Papaya’s prepared everything. Okay, Ruiz. You come with me... So we can plan for tomorrow. You'd like to have a bath, right'? I'll help you. There's only enough water for one person... I'm sorry, but you can have a bath together... ls that a problem'? - Not at all. It's no big deal. Just so long as we leave as soon as possible. Well? What are you doing there'? Playing statue. Come on. How nice, I don't think it will be a relaxing bath. I don't like to be dressed when others are naked. She looks like your type. Now, go next door and wait for me. What do you want'? Go away. Let go of me. Where are you taking me'? Help. That's enough, this is getting beyond a joke. No one's joking here. - Then pull out an explanation. Look, you're not in a position to ask anything. A little patience and you might even get a nice story... Isn't that your job'? And my friend'? - Don't worry... He's in good hands. Lucky him. Papaya, listen carefully to what I'm about to tell you... The journalist has seen you with Brian... And she must know what this is all about. You'll have to work on Vincent... Get all of the names of the engineers who are working on the nuclear plant. We'll only be able to act if we have accurate information. I think you all agree, right'? We're a small organization and we'd prefer to operate passively. I mean without weapons. Good morning, lady. Come here. Let's go. Do you want to eat'? I'm hungry. Yes, I'm starving. - Come here, there's fruit. I knew Dean, your colleague... That guy who worked at the nuclear power station. He's dead. - Yes, I know. I was also at the hotel when they found his body. You know he didn't agree with the power station. He was quite the opposite with me... He was fanatical about nuclear energy... And he understood that progress has to win. I had a lot of respect for him. But you can't understand these things. Right, only you understand. Look... The brain is the same colour for everyone. Sorry, that's not what I meant to say... But I don't think you know much about nuclear energy? No. All I know is that it will poison our land. Now I understand. You're one of the people who kicked up a stink about the power station. Convinced, and committed. You know who else thinks like you'? My friend, Sara. Speaking of which... What happened to her'? - She went with my friends. But don't worry, she's old enough. Right. You must never leave me. Wait. A little doll? - No, thanks, I'm not interested. It brings good luck, it's very cheap. I don't have any money. - It doesn't matter, take it. No, I don't want it. - You're Papaya’s friend, take it. You can't refuse, now you can go. You'll see, you'll feel reborn after this. There's a meeting in the village tonight. But I'm not finished here. - Do it when you come back. Luis wants to see you as well. I have to go. - Why? Why did you throw it away'? - You'll try it another time. Why are you leaving? You can't leave me now. Wait if you want, otherwise you can go. You know I won't go, not without you. The work at the power station is nearly finished I'll go back to Europe, and you'll come with me, right'? Sure, sure. I'll go with you. Stay, my love. Vincent. Vincent, quick... we have to get out of here... I think I've figured it all out. - What happened to you'? Why did you leave'? - I didn't leave... Not of my own free will, they took me away... It was that guy, Ramon. I don't know what they want from me... But they want to kill you. - What are you talking about'? I'm talking about this hole, this village, these people. I'm talking about Papaya. I saw her working over some poor, barely human, wreck of a man. Which is what you'll be if you don't leave. Now, I've had enough. Okay, it's your job to invent stories... But that's enough. Either you speak clearly... Or leave me in peace. What do you want me to tell you'? I'm happy with that girl, I'm making fantastic discoveries... And I have no intention of... - Wait. Think for a moment. Who is Papaya? Who were those people at the party'? And, above all, where do they come from'? No, don't answer that, you couldn't, anyway. They're all people who had to leave their homes... And do you know what for'? To make space for you. To make space for you and your nuclear power station. Don't you see'? That's why Dean disappeared. And that's why Scott disappeared in exactly the same way. Yes, you've disappeared as well. - Listen here, Sara... I'm here because I want to be here. Work has stopped on the power station for the moment... And I've done nothing more except have a nice holiday. You can leave if you've had enough. No one's stopping you. - You've gone mad. You can't see beyond your nose. All you see is there, between that girl's legs. I just hope you get out of this alive. They let you get away, it was their task to bring you back. Come on. - Let go. From the documents Papaya took from Dean... We have the construction schedule. We'll take a truck to the site and see what damage we can do. They won't understand anything anymore. Then we'll deal with the technicians. Engineers can design projects but they're useless without technicians. Okay, guys. We're agreed. Bye. - Bye. You made it. - Yes, the children found her. That pleases me, I expected it. You must have lost something. Thank you. - No, it's not worth the trouble. I'll keep it as a reminder, if you don't mind'? Relax, you're among friends. - l'd like to know why I'm here'? You're very curious, but I'll try to please you. You're a journalist, right'? We found out after the party. Although we're more interested in your geologist friend. I figured that much, he works for the power station. You see, we're collecting anything... ...that might be useful if we have to leave the village and go to the mountains. So you think the power station will be built, in spite of this'? What do you think? I think your methods won't get you very far. That's the reason we decided to have you stay here. You can write all the articles you want about our cause. What will you do about my friend'? - He shouldn't have accepted that job. May I ask you a question'? - That's why you're here. Why are you against it'? Did you see how beautiful it is here'? The by-products, the nuclear waste... Yes. - It will ruin everything. It will poison the land, and us'? What will happen to us'? Can you tell me'? We're poor, okay... But this is our land, and we want to keep it. We don't need nuclear power, all we need is the sun... The sea, love, nature... All these things. - Yes, but killing human beings? Listen, we didn't start this, and this isn't just some gang. It's an entire village, we rebelled together. Naturally, we fight in our own way. With the weapons we have at our disposal... Silence, without saying anything to anyone. Because when we did talk, no one listened to us. But now it's different, it's an experience. This is why I ask you to stay. So you can report this experience. Then the public will know about our condition. They'll understand more. Stay'? Where'? There are huts all around, you'll have your own. Keep still. So, you don't want to tell me'? - I don't know when, I don't know... I'm sure they'll send someone to investigate... About these disappearances. I'm sure of it. Do you know when they'll arrive'? - No, no... I don't know, I told you. Yes, yes, like that. Like that. No, don't go. Stay. Don't go. Papaya. Come back. No.. what do you want'? No! Come here. Wait. Look out! Get up. Have you gone mad'? You see, in this short time I've come to understand... I've come to understand everything about you and your people. Even what my mind had refused to admit until now. That violence is justified only when it is used to oppose other violence. When it's the last resort. Especially when its true authentic reason for existing... ls for the survival of the species. You taught me this. You all taught me this. And now take back your dagger. A grain of sand can't be allowed to spoil an instrument... ...based on truth and justice. It's my fault, you shouldn't be jealous... Even if Ruiz is your man. Papaya. You haven't understood anything. No, wait. Papaya, what are you doing here'? - lsn't it obvious'? Or do you want the details? - Get out of here. Yes, you were the last person to see the geologist. They left together on a trip. Inspector. - Here she is. She really is beautiful. I'm sorry I'm late. Perhaps you'd like a drink? - No, thanks. We'd better leave immediately or they'll start without us. I'm coming. Are you sure my presence isn't necessary? No, for now I'm just investigating on behalf of the company. Besides, you're too well known. - Fine, okay. Good bye. - Good bye. See you soon. We'll have to stick together, let's not be so formal. Of course. Is the round stone ritual really that good'? Yes, and unforgettable, too. Yes, it's a type of Macumba, or Voodoo. It goes back to the time of the Incas. They all gather in front of a stone... A round one, naturally, and they go wild. But no one knows where the stone is. I always thought it was nonsense. No. - Look at her. She's brave being out in the sun. Stop, let's give her a ride. If you want. Are you going to Las Ventas'? - You're in luck, get in. What's your name'? - Papaya. What a funny name. - And what's your name'? Archibald. What a funny name!
