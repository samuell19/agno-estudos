There is nothing for me and life. But roses, dear. If you ask me it is more important than food and drink. Yes, sir. It's more important. I don't know just how to take you. What do you think he did? I said: 'don't you ever try that again'. I haven't had a report card like this since I left kindergarten. This is the dullest college I've ever been to in my life. Why, Junior. How can you be so sacrilegious? Seated here beneath the statue of the venerable and respected founder .. Of this great institution. Why, I am amazed at you, Junior. I am surprised. Astounded. But these alterations we must assume are the consequences of chemical processes. Which we still have to discover. Inside the morphosis then, which you will remember is the term .. By which we designate in biology the complete transformation of the cells. We can distinguish four chief states. One. The differentiation or embryonic stage. Two. Differentiation. Three. Degeneration. And four, death. Now, as I was saying a few moments ago. Not until the protoplasm has grown sufficiently .. Does it acquire its characteristic color through the formation of haemoglobin. Thus becoming a young red blood corpuscle. The red blood corpuscles afford us an excellent example .. Of a complete cytomorphosis. [ Car horn ] Now we will take example 'A'. The simple cells with a well-formed nucleus .. But with little protoplasm. [ Car horn ] B. The protoplasm grows. [ Car horn ] Do you mind .. No, sir. I mean, do you mind closing the window. Oh. The window. Hiya, lad. - Hiya, Duke. [ Car horn ] Say, why not toot that thing under the Dean's window? You'll get more action. Well, I would. Only my date isn't with the Dean. This is a new one, isn't it? Oh, just a little trinket that dropped out of Papa's pocket. Gee, the old one was alright. This one seems more like a hotel. Only better. You don't have to register. Is that all you think about? Life, liberty and the pursuit of women. That's my platform. Ah, romance rears its ugly head. Going right out. Duke Galloway's sightseeing trips to all parts of the city. Don't fritter away golden hours of youth. It makes 'em wild, it makes 'em fresh. Well, the Galloway approach system doesn't seem to be working today. Here come a couple of quickies. Want to give them a demonstration? Listen, I have got a connection to make. Hello Toni. - Hello. See what Papa brought home? Say. How about burning up a little asphalt? Never mind about her. She can sit in the rumble seat and put a blanket over her head. Not over my head. You'd look pretty good with a blanket over your head. Hey. Hello, Michael. Well, how is your biology? Well, you may not know it. But cytomorphosis is a protoplasm that isn't a nucleus. Think of that. Michael, I thought you had a class today. I did but I cut it. - Oh, and I made another date. You see I promised to help Grace over at the house. She's going for a quiz you know. Oh, that's alright. What time will you be through? I don't know. I had better call you. Where will you be? Well. - Betty. Duke said to tell you he'd meet you tonight at Tolers. The Dean has him on the carpet. Duke? Oh yes. Thanks. Goodbye. Oh, so you are running around with Galloway now? No, I am not. I was just going to go for a ride with him in his new car. So that's where you were yesterday and the day before? I just came from one lecture. I thought you would .. It's alright. You don't need to explain. - I am not explaining. It's all my fault. I was chump enough to believe it was different between us. It is different. Because two people like each other is no reason for them to sit about and dry up. I am not my grandmother. I like to have fun. I'm modern. I don't see why you shouldn't go out with Galloway if you want. You're the only one on campus he's missed. Can you think of any more insults? - Sorry. I am fresh out. Well, goodbye. It's been nice meeting you after all these years. Michael. If you're ever in Chillcasee falls, drop in and see me. Smith is the name. You will find it under "S" in the phone book. Goodbye, again. Give your grandmother my love and remember to brush your teeth. Well. Goodbye, professor. - Goodbye, Bob. Hey there. It's not polite to skulk past a fraternity brother without speaking. I'm sorry. I was thinking. - Good. What is on your mind? Studies? Oh no. They're alright. - Financial troubles? No more than usual. Well, what is it? Maybe I can help you. We had our problems when I went to school, you know. Yes. But things were different in those days. I don't know. We had the same campus and automobiles. And if I remember correctly we had women also. They are quite a problem, you know. Yes. But girls are wilder than they were then. Yes, I suppose so. They can smell a good time three blocks away. If a fellow doesn't happen to be fixed so that he can give them a good time. They find it someplace else. Women have changed, haven't they. Take Duke Galloway for instance. Do you know him? - Galloway. Galloway? Yes, yes. - He is a likeable fellow. He lives his life as he sees it. I don't suppose you can blame a girl for running around with him if she wants to. Naturally not. The trouble with most of us is that we still have ideals. What is the matter with ideals? They are alright, aren't they? I don't know. What are ideals? They are just notions we get someplace about what is right and wrong. Pretty soon they become part of you so that after a while .. Even though you believe something that's wrong is right you can't do it. That doesn't prove that it is wrong. I guess this all sounds very silly. Not at all. Not at all. I get your viewpoint perfectly. Well. I've got to be running along. It's been nice talking to you, Prof. You seem to understand things. I think I do pretty well for an older generation. I didn't mean to .. - Nonsense, Mike. Nonsense. You have taught me a great deal about the problems of modern youth. We must see each other often. You know, lots of times I've become confused about life and .. Naturally, I like to have someone to talk things over with. Oh. Well thanks, Prof. See you later. - So long, Mike. Well, there is one thing you got to say about it. It's a modest little job. It will have to do until the depression is over. As soon as I get around to it I'm going to put a kitchenette in the back. And a new wing goes in on this side overlooking the park. Well, if it isn't the lone wolf. Say, I wish you'd train your women to be here on time if I have a date with them. I can lead them up to your trough but I can't make them drink. Ah, never mind. I will attend to that. Hello, pollywog. - Hello, Dora. Why do you care if they're sharp or not? You can rub your beard off with a towel. Wait until you start to shave. Alright. Alright. What about free love? There is nothing free about my love, Romeo. Just remember that. - Are you for sale? Let's broaden the conversation. When I get on a subject I like to stay with it. Hey Abe, how about that butter? Stop it. I've got to find out things for myself. How do I know? You may be knock-kneed. I thought you came to college to develop your brain. Oh, who cares about brains? I come from a long line of people who work with their hands. Alright, alright. What do you want to talk about? That's not so funny. Are you working out for the track team or is this a new game? I don't like free love with my meals. The trouble is with you, you are old fashioned. Maybe so. But what was good enough for my grandmother is good enough for me. Well, I don't want to be honorable with you unless it is absolutely necessary. I'll call you up sometime when I break training. Don't they ever talk about anything else? What else is there to talk about? How about something to eat? I don't know what I want. - Give me three guesses? Do people ever talk about marriage anymore? Some of the older people. Why don't you get married? What do you hang around a dump like this for? The scrambled eggs are nice. It is none of my business but you are a good-looking girl. You think so? - You are bright. Oh, I get it. Being bright don't get you nowhere. It is looking dumb. When I first got this job I used to go home nights and study grammar. I thought it might help me if I talked better. But after going out with a couple of these apes around here .. I threw the grammar out the window and went in for self-defence. After all, creation didn't stop when it made these gorillas. You ought to know some nice fellows. Sure. You mean in my own class. Oh, I didn't mean .. - Oh, it is okay. Listen, precious. It ain't much fun after working hard all day .. And going home nights and just going to bed. But it's much better than sitting around the rest of your life .. Listening to some iceman's helper yawn himself to sleep. Yeah. I guess you got it pretty tough at that. Oh, I ain't complaining. Not as long as you think I am good looking. What's that got to do with it? It just helps me go on. Look at me. I'm going to be a missionary. You would make a swell missionary. What do you mean by that? You arouse my savage instincts. She hit you pretty hard, didn't she? What do you mean? How about the chicken patties? We're trying to get rid of them. Alright. Wheel 'em in. Chicken patties for one! So I said to the Dean. I said .. If I can't have a few liberties around here I will get myself another college. Oh, hello. - Hello, Duke. Well, take me home for $2.98. I'm sorry I've got to run along but I'll see you later. Let's give the wide-open spaces a treat. - Have you seen Michael? Michael? Michael. No. Have you looked in all the gutters? Oh Duke. - Come on. Get in. No. I'm afraid I can't go. What? A stand-up? - No. I am sorry. I've got some work to do. You will be overeducated. Come on. - I can't go. You could sit in it a minute, can't you? Oh well, just a minute then. I want you to try out the springs. Where you going tonight, babe? The same place you are only in a different direction. It's about time you gave that Cameron cutie the air. Why? What has she got that anybody else ain't got? Why talk about her? That's all over. She has certainly given that Galloway a play. Who said so? What do you care? You ain't interested. That's right. But why drag Galloway in? I just happened to see the two of them out front. How about that patty? It certainly has everything in it. All the comforts of home except running water. Turn that little now and hear funny noises. How did I miss that? [ Radio music ] Hello, Michael. Well, where have you been? We've been looking all over for you. Still angry, Michael? - Michael, have you been angry? I hope you will pardon the intrusion but some denizens of this eating emporium .. Have been nauseated at the spectacle of our young people necking in the streets. So, I have been asked to recommend a more secluded spot. Out on the Jericho Turnpike. Where one may indulge in amorous display minus the intrusion of prying eyes. I will take the matter up with the board of directors. Pardon me, please. [ Radio music. Loud ] So, as I understand it you go out to the Jericho Turnpike and then ..? You turn left and you come to an old apple tree. Bearing white blossoms. Jericho Turnpike. Turn left. Old apple tree. You can't miss it. It is right next to a pig-pen. If we see any of your relatives shall we give them a message? You'd better hurry up, precious. Your patties getting cold. You mustn't let your patties get cold. You should have brought your mittens. What's the matter? - I am mad. You're not mad at me, are you? I'll give him a piece of my mind while I'm in the mood. Give him a piece of mine while you're at it. - I'll be right back. And bring his head back on a platter. Where is your flaming Romeo? If you must know he is waiting for me outside. Better go and look after him. He is likely to get asthma. I am here to demand an apology. Sorry. I never apologise while I am easting. Well, you are going to apologise. You are as stubborn as a mule. Are you going to apologise or not? If you want this booth you can have it. You in again? Why do we have to quarrel all the time? I'll ask the first cop I see. There was no excuse for being rude about it. I came down this evening to tell Duke I couldn't go. I believe most of what you say. Then you are going to apologise? - I doubt it. You are. - Yeah? Well. I'll stay here until you do apologise. They'll probably find you here when they excavate this place. A hundred years from now. Shall I order you another fork? I rather like eating out of the same trough with you. You need this worse than I do. You can have it. I'm in here to take on some nourishment and you insist on making a scene. I'm not making a scene. - You are making .. I'm not making .. - You're making a scene. You're making a scene right now. - I came to demand an apology. Why don't you go away from here? - What about my pride? What about your dignity. - Never mind my dignity. I'll follow you until I get an apology. - You are, are you? Yes I am. - That will be interesting. Hey, you can't come in here. You can't stop me. - Haven't you got any sense? Don't push me you big gorilla. - Somebody might come in here. I hope they do. You'll wish you never talked to me the way you did. Alright, but not here. - Do you believe I came down here .. I believe you came down to tell Duke anything. Alright then. Apologise. - Alright. I apologise. Now come on, get out of here. I have done everything you've asked, haven't I? You haven't kissed me. - I don't want to kiss you. Well, do you promise to get out? - After you have kissed me. Oh. Alright. [ Car horn ] You big brute. You have broken my shoulder strap. Got a pin? - Where would I get a pin? How about that one? You mean it? What do you think? I think you had better get out of here. Steady there, Preston. You're going around a curve. Excuse me. I am all turned around. [ Female scream! ] So about 2 o'clock the caps started blowing off. Boy, it sounded like machine-gun fire. We went down looking and there wasn't even a single full bottle left. 18 gallons. Boy, I sat down and had myself a good cry. I don't like to change the subject, but just what is a hypothesis? A hypothesis? Is a pig-like animal with a very large mouth. They inhabit fraternity houses. Sometimes you find them under rocks. You apes are going to revolutionise education. Who has got my polka-dot drawers? I saw a crowd of people wearing them on the campus this morning. Why lie to him? I saw them on a pink elephant last night. When I woke up this morning the elephant was gone. Well, whoever belongs to these doll's pants can have them. Hey, did you happen to look on the flagpole? Oh. Hello. Hey, you. Say, when is the committee meeting for the dance tomorrow night? Well, you are right on time. That meeting was last night. Oh yeah? Well, listen you guys. I'm putting in the first bid for the parking space next to the fountain. There will be a lot of excited women chasing me tomorrow night .. And I want some place handy to cool them off. What are you reading, mother goose? "Biological urge as manifested in early youth is fraught with great danger." Hey, freshmen. Shall I read it out loud? Better keep it quiet. He is too young to know about life. Never mind, dear. When you get to be a big boy mother will explain everything. Until then, don't let any of the other little boys teach you anything. The conversation was alright until you came in here. Well let's change the subject. How about free love? How about freewheeling? I hope you mugs are bringing a lot of nice wrens for me tomorrow night. Who are you bringing, Duke? Oh, I am playing the field. There is one little number though that's been pining away for me a long time. She is engaged to some bull too. But you know old Galloway. He follows them right up the hope altar. How can you expect women to resist your charms when you can't do it yourself? Ah well, you can't blame them much at that. Not much. Are you trying to brush something off my shoulder? It is religious fervour. I am feeling for your wings. Gee, you are touchy. You know, you'd be much nicer if you'd loosen your morals. I would be much more comfortable if you would loosen your grip. Just because you wear some flathead's pin there is no reason to get morbid. You are not married yet. Have you ever tried dancing with your feet? You know, these college engagements don't last. Statistics prove that only one out of every 978 and two thirds .. Ever reach a legal culmination. Which proves that 977 and two thirds have been wrong up until now. On the contrary. It proves that it is cheaper to buy milk. When you can't afford coffee. Hello precious. Hello Michael. - Hello Betty. Five. Mind if I cut in? - No. How are you, Steve? Thank you. Thank you. Been watching you all evening. You are really are a divine dancer. I hope this dance is as profitable for you as it is for me. Aren't you dancing tonight, Prof? No. I only do the waltzes. What a night. Bracing, isn't it. - It's weakening. I insist that it is bracing. It's all a matter of age. Look here, young man. I'm beginning to dislike that word. Well, do things seem any brighter than they did a day or so ago? I'll say. Did they hold fraternity dances in your day? Yes indeed. I don't suppose things have chanced much at that. No, not much. Only we used to spark instead of neck. You know, Prof. I've been thinking things over and .. I have just about decided to chuck it all. What? Give up school? Your career? I am not so hot about it anyway and .. I have been thinking that .. I might like to get married. But you have only got two years to go. I know that seems like a long time but it is not so long .. If you really want what you came here for. I do want it, Prof. But what good does is education if it interferes with your happiness? There are other things too. I wouldn't mind waiting for them .. If I could just be sure that they would still be there when I got through. That nothing had changed. I remember I nearly made the same mistake you are about to make. Were you in love too? It is possible, you know. I was your age once. I wanted to get married. I remember it seemed very difficult to us at the time. There was summer nights. The lilacs were growing. And we had the same moon. I am afraid that some of my new steps are a little bit old-fashioned. As a dancing partner, I am going to recommend you to all the girls present. How do you mean that? Well, we won't go into that if you don't mind. But what happened? - Huh? Oh nothing. Nothing. I guess that is just it. Nothing. She married someone else? - No, no, no. She's is teaching. Did you have a fight or something? - No, no. Nothing like that. - Well, what? Why? Well, you see. She thought .. That is .. that is we thought it would be best for me to finish. That is .. She wanted me to have the thing I set out for. My degree. We. Well, we both wanted things to be right. But that isn't the point I am trying to bring out. The point I am trying to bring out is that people mustn't be hasty. What you're saying is the very thing .. - You don't understand .. What I am saying. How do I know? If we'd been married we might have been very unhappy. Wouldn't that have been better than to have missed it altogether? See here, young man. I am a professor of biology. I won't be misinterpreted. Well, precious. Here is the body but the soul belongs to me. Think you'll ever get over it? I won't dance with him again unless he wears boxing gloves. Now don't forget that blue number. Just forget him. Well. It sure is a warm orchestra. David, you have been avoiding me all evening. Surely you must have one more dance left in your system? Why, I have spent the whole evening looking forward to a hot waltz. You mustn't blame David for his lack of enthusiasm. Twenty years ago when we were students together. I mean, ten years ago. His fragility wasn't entirely confined to his mind. I can imagine. Was it, David? - Huh? No. I was what you call a 'hot-shot'. Mike. Sit over here. Why are you so solemn? Gee, it's great being engaged to a boy like you. I am in love with you. For your mind, partly. And I love you for your curly whiskers. Gosh, I can't wait to hear you shave. Darling, let's not wait. Why don't we chuck it all? Let's get married. Michael. I know a guy out in California that will get me a job anytime I want it. We can't go on like this. Betty. We are crazy. - Mike. You don't mean you'd quit school? Given up everything you have worked for so hard? What do they mean compared to you? - Don't think I don't want to. As much as you do. But I couldn't. Oh Michael, it is so important. Later on, you would never forgive yourself. You would blame me. And you have a right to if I let you give up everything for me. Michael. Are you afraid it won't last? You know better than that. Two years just waiting. Why .. How do I know? Maybe it wouldn't last. - Michael. I heard of a guy today that .. What does it matter about anyone else? I won't change. And I won't let you change. If I have to use every feminine wile that I know about. Please, darling. There is no telling what might happen. Do you love me? Let's go home. Goodnight, dear. - Goodnight, honey. Promise me you will think it over. It is so important. And Michael, later on it may affect our whole lives. Oh, Michael. Michael. Michael. Michael. Make it good and cold, huh. Cold it is. Hello precious. You still here? - It's only 12 o'clock. I have the rest of the night all to myself. Banking hours? - Uhuh. My, but you look cute in that monkey suit. Thanks. You don't feel like walking, do you? No. It's not safe for a girl to be alone on the streets after midnight. Goodnight, Mr Toler. - Goodnight, Dora. Well, this is the Swale mansion. It's quite a cute place. Sure. It has doors and everything. Want to come in? - I guess I hadn't better. Oh, come on in a minute. I may be able to scare up some liquid excitement. How about the family? Don't worry about that. My old man works nights. I hardly ever see him. It's getting pretty late, don't you think? Oh, come on in. It's not so bad after the first shock. Don't mind the mess. I fired the servants this morning. That's alright. You should see our joint sometime. This is Pop's dynamite. He hides in the stove so I can't find it. Well, all we need now is a little time. Do you suppose it is alright? Sure, it's alright. It's half gone. The old man wasn't blind the last time I saw him. I mean, do you suppose he'd have any objections? No. He won't know the difference. Now, you hold the baby while I get the glasses. Why, what is all the trembling about? You had better come over here and just watch it. Because that is all there is. There ain't no more. I'll be right back. [ Door knocks ] Yes? May I come in? - Yes, do. What do you think? I don't know. What do I think? - I'm in love. I can hardly believe it. - Were you ever that way? Don't I look human? - I mean, were you ever engaged? For years. - Don't joke. I want to ask you something. Suppose a man who had spent all his life planning to be something big. And then he met a girl and wanted to give it all up and get married. Do you think the girl should let him? You haven't any right to ask me questions like that. I am sorry, Barbara. Why, isn't this you? Hmm. Taken right here on the campus. What a funny dress. That is professor Mathews. Was it ..? It wasn't David? There are a lot of things I keep hidden, Betty. I was rather like you, afraid of responsibility. And so we waited. Then, after a while .. I can't believe that of David. - Oh, it wasn't his fault. It wasn't anyone's fault. It happened so gradually we .. We didn't even see it go. We just looked around for it one day and .. It wasn't there. Well, you can't run the race over again, you know. Gee, you are a peach. May I use your telephone? Certainly. And you can tell him from me, young woman. He's got to let you spend more time on your English or I am going to flunk you. No you're not. I am going to get married. [ Telephone ] Oh dry up. Turn off the heat, baby. I haven't got fire insurance. Neither have I. No firm would take it. It is too big a risk. What? Too big. Too big a risk. The booze sure packs a wallop. The old man got it off a fire boat. He got it off just in time. I can't forget it. Where is it? - It's over there. Over there? [ Radio: ] "At the sound of the gong it will be exactly 4 am." "WJJ signing off." "Good morning, folks." Is that day breaking or my head cracking open? I feel terrible. Is that the way I affect you? I got to get out of here. Are you sorry? About what? You know. You're sweet. Sure. Give me the police station. According to the report of the police officer who made the arrest .. The boy is charged with the seduction of a minor. That is pretty serious, Professor. Do you understand? I've talked with the boy Mr Gifford .. And I am convinced he doesn't remember clearly just what happened. Now, I know the lad. I have been his confidante. He is a boy of high ideals. And I can't stand by and see his life ruined .. By some circumstance over which he had no control. Well, I have sent for the boy. The girl and her father are outside. Sometimes these matters can be settled without result to law. Send in Mr Swale and the young lady with him. You must understand, Professor. That while I am not always in sympathy with certain laws. Nevertheless, it is my duty to enforce them. Will you be seated, please. Mr Swale .. Mr Mathews. How do you do. - How do you do. Are you his lawyer? No. Mr Mathews is a professor at the state university. So you are a college professor? So you're the guy that teaches them .. - Just a moment, Mr Swale. Mr Mathews visit here is purely a friendly one. Well, I am a tax payer and I .. - I understand. Nobody will put nothing over on me. - Calm yourself, Mr Swale. Will you sit down please. Have a seat, young man. Do you know this young lady? Dora? Yes, sir. How did you meet her? In Tolers. She is a waitress over there. Tell Mr Gifford just what happened last night. Well. I went in to Tolers after the dance and .. Dora was there and she was just going home. So I walked home with her. And. We had a couple of drinks. What happened after that I guess everybody knows about. I don't remember much myself. So, you don't remember, eh? No, sir. I don't. - You can't get away with that. Pleas, Mr Swale. Be reasonable. I will be reasonable. But I know the law. He will marry my daughter or go to the penitentiary. Marry? - That's what I said: Marry. But Mr Swale. Marriage isn't going to help the situation. So you think he is too good for her? She ain't been to college. But Mr Swale, it wouldn't be right. We don't love each other. So, you don't love each other, eh? - Do we, Dora? You are a fine guy to be talking about what is right. If I knew last night the kind of snake you was, I'd have taken the law into .. My own hands and no jury in the country would have convicted me. You will marry her, you contemptible .. - That isn't necessary, Mr Swale. Mr Swale, if he is all that. Would you still have your daughter marry him? What else could she do? It is a terrible pity Mr Swale that things happened the way they have. But how would it make things right to force them to marry? Just because the social system ignores the natural impulses of the young. So that's it, eh? So that is what you teach them in college. Well, what about the sanctity of the home? What about the marriage laws? Mr Swale, marriage wasn't intended to ruin people's lives. It was intended to bring them happiness. What do I care about her happiness? I am thinking about what is right and what's wrong. I've tried to be decent about this thing. I don't want to drag Dora's name in the gutter. If you want, we'll let the newspapers decide whether it is right .. For a low dog to come into a man's house and ruin his daughter's honor. And while we're about it .. We'll have them print the kind of stuff being taught at the university. Boys and girls learning that morals is all wrong. That the church is all wrong and that they don't have to marry. Mr Swale, you misunderstood. - No, I didn't. I ain't been to college but I understand the English language. What's more I'm going to put him where he belongs. I'm going to put him into the penitentiary. Come on, Dora. Please. Wait a minute. So it's different now, eh? - Michael, be careful. This is my affair. I can't drag you into it. I'll marry her. That's more like it. But Michael .. - You keep out of this. I know what is best for you. How soon do I have to marry her? You'll marry her right away or take the consequences. Will tonight be alright? I have got some things to do. How do I know you won't run away? I'll be responsible for the boy, Mr Swale. Well, that is different. A word is as good as a bond with me. Here, give me a hand. My daughter comes from good people, son. And I ain't such a bad guy when you get to know me. I will see you at my house tonight. Come on, Dora. And remember. I don't want no tricks. Sorry, Michael. It's alright, Prof. It's just life I guess and I got to go through with it. Anyhow, what difference does it make now. You poor kid. Betty. Who is going to tell her? I guess I had better do it myself. I couldn't let her hear it from anyone else. Only. You will stick by me until this thing is over .. Won't you? I got to have somebody. Michael. Yoo-hoo. Michael. I got your message and I'm all out of breath. I ran up all the way. Oh, let me look at you. Where have you been? Don't ever stay away so long again. Betty, wait. - No. I won't. When I think of what we nearly missed it frightens me. Oh, Michael. We are never going to wait for anything again. State College is going to lose two of its brightest pupils. California. Mr and Mrs Michael Harvey. Mrs and Mrs Michael Harvey. Mr and Mrs .. - Stop it! Stop it! Michael. There will be a Mrs Michael Harvey alright. But it won't be you. It is too late after all. Do you see? I got to marry someone else. Michael. Don't look at me like that. It's true. It happened last night. I got to marry her or go to jail. It seems there is a law that says something like that. Please. Please don't. You are better off without me anyway. I am no good or I couldn't have done a thing like that. You can't marry anyone else. I won't let you do it. We'll run away. We'll do something. Too late. It's not too late. It's my fault as much as yours. I should have been with you. - Oh no you shouldn't. A guy has got to behave according to the textbooks his great grandfather wrote. Yet nothing ever comes true. Nothing at all. I guess it .. it doesn't. Nothing ever comes true. Michael. Don't leave me. Oh, please don't leave me. [ Car horn ] Snap out of it. Say, have you and that ape been fighting again? Why do you hang around those irritating guys? Take Dr Galloway for instance. The answer to a maiden's prayer. Smooth and sincere for unhappy females. Must have said the wrong thing. What is the matter with you? Nothing. Except I just got a kick on the shin for trying to be decent. Well now, what have I been telling you? Being decent doesn't get you anywhere. You are right. - Sure I am right. Okay. If other people can go to the devil I guess I can too. Why, sure. Let's get away from campus. Let's do things. Let's go places. Let's drink. Let's do everything that is bad. Hey. Now listen. You have been hit pretty hard. Maybe I have. I tried being good and everything turned out wrong. Maybe if I try being bad for a while things will be different. Look. Look at me. You couldn't be bad if you wanted to. Yes I could. - No, you couldn't. I could. - Listen, silly. People have to be born bad. All you need is a lot of fresh air. I tell you what we'll do. We'll go for a long ride out in the country. Go so fast it will make your head spin. I'll buy you a glass of milk or something. We'll sit under the trees and talk things over. In the morning you'll be a new woman. There you are. Smile. It's alive. It's the Galloway system. It makes them wild and makes them frantic. A soothing, soothing system. Fresh air, crackers and milk. Never fails. Man or beast. Yes. It was, eh? Yeah. 119 North Beaumont. Well, you know how these kids are. Well, get over as soon as you can, will you. Yeah. Goodbye. That was Judge Mitchell. He will be a little late. I hope you don't mind. The Swales and Mitchells have known each other for years. That's why it ought to be nice to have him for the ceremony. Yeah. The Swales is one of the oldest families in this neck of the woods. Is that so? Yeah. My grandfather settled here way back in the '70s. Here. Would you like to look at this? No thank you. Will you have a cigar? No thank you. Well, would you like a little drink? No thank you, Mr Swale. You see, I too am a respectable citizen. Well, I didn't mean anything. I understand perfectly. Hello, Michael. Hello, Dora. Well. She certainly looks great even if she is my daughter. Well. We got a car waiting outside ready to take you to the station. All we need now is Judge Mitchell and everything will be set. Yeah. I believe in doing things right. She is my only daughter you know. Well, well, well. So you two kids are going to live in California. How far is California? I used to know. How far is it, son? What? California. It is a very long way. I used to know but I forget. It is three thousand miles. Three thousand miles? Yes, of course. That is it. That is a long way. Yeah, California, eh. You know, I think there was a branch of the Swale family .. That settled out there way back in '49. [ Telephone ] That is probably Judge Mitchell again. Hello. Oh? Yes. Yes. He is here. It is for you, Professor. She seems pretty excited. Hello? Where? It happened half an hour ago at the Jericho Turnpike. Oh, it is very serious. Please hurry. - Alright. What's the trouble? - There has been an accident. Can you drive us to the emergency hospital? What's happened? Somebody hurt? It is pretty serious. - Well, yes. What about Judge Mitchell? - Mitchell will have to wait. Well, I know. But, now wait a minute. You had better come along, Michael. Wait a minute there. Hey. Look, Mitchell is to be here in a few minutes. Why don't we .. How are they? What does the doctor say? Duke is very badly hurt. Betty. Betty. Betty. Michael. Poor Michael. Duke. Where is he? Is he alright? He was only trying to help me. And make me forget. Are you alright? I am alright now. Are you Professor Mathews? He wants to talk to you. Come on. Come on. She is alright. All she needs is a little rest. You had better go over and cheer him up. Hiya, Prof. - Hello, Duke. Well. I am on my way, I guess. Huh? No, Duke. You are going to be alright. Thanks for lying. Hello, Mike. - Hello, Duke. How is Betty? She is alright. She is fine. She is a swell kid. Why don't you .. Marry the girl, you ape. You ought to make them get married, Prof. They are so lovesick it's silly. Who is that guy in the dark suit? The undertaker? Tell him to wait outside. Duke makes them all wait. Is that right, Dora? Well, Prof. I guess I was geared for a short sprint. Short and merry. That's Galloway. Ah. It was a great show. Lots of laughs. I may have missed something but I don't think so. Most of us miss something, Duke. Maybe we find out about too late. Well, Prof. How about the old grip, kid? Well. Go and buy a light suit. And get yourself .. some sex appeal. Come with me, dear. Come with me. There, there. He ain't dead, is he? So that's what it's like. Gee. Life is pretty lousy, ain't it. We ain't the ones to say what is right and wrong. Who knows what is right and wrong? A swell kid like that .. Who wasn't doing anything but trying to make somebody else happy. If there is right and wrong, why wasn't he taken when he broke a commandment .. Instead of while he was trying to help somebody? Is that wrong, to try and make somebody else's load lighter? Tell me that. We ain't the ones to say about these things, Dora. Then why does everybody do it? Don't do this. Don't do that. This is right. This is Wrong. How do they know what's right and wrong? How does anybody know? You don't have to take their word for it, Dora. I've always tried to teach you what is right and wrong. Yes, that is just it. You have always tried to teach me what you think is right and wrong. What if you are wrong? Where is my comeback? I listened to you this morning. I listened to you all laying out my life for me. Just because I did something wrong. It didn't seem wrong to me. But even if it was wrong. If the only thing that's going to make me right .. Is to steal what doesn't belong to me .. Then I don't want to be right. Tell Mike it's alright. I ain't going to marry him. Dora. Oh, Pop. You wouldn't love me any more if I was Mrs Michael Harvey .. Than if I am Dora Swale. In fact you would love me less because you wouldn't respect me. How could anyone respect me? That is the only beautiful clean kind of love in the world. I've learned that much and you didn't teach it to me. Oh, Pop. I promise to be the kind of a girl you want me to be. If you'll only give me a break and come home once in a while. Come on, Pop. You are a swell girl, Dora. Oh. Save that chatter for them apes of yours. Hold still. There. I am going to put this snapshot on my dressing-table. To remind me of a very foolish girl. You understand, Betty? - I understand. Do you mean to imply that my wife is foolish? I haven't mentioned any names. Well, Mike. I hope you realize you have got to go through life without a diploma. I'll try and bear up under it. And probably all your children will turn out to be college professors. l don't care as long as they are Betty's and mine. Goodbye. - Goodbye. Lots of luck to you both. Goodbye! Hey, Prof. Watch. What is the Latin name for that? Well, that is just another manifestation of .. The chemical process known as cytomorphosis. It is all a matter of age. -ros-
