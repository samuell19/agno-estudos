(ominous music) (explosions) (explosions) (explosions) (explosions) (explosions) (explosions) (explosions) (wind chimes chiming) (melancholic music) Sarah: Sometimes I wonder where the time went. I miss the busy school days, the stupid fights with my sister. I miss the laughing and crying. I miss arguing with dad over when I could go out, and when I couldn't. It's the silly things that I miss, the things I took for granted back before it all ended. Before the world changed, all I wanted was to be left alone, time to do whatever I wanted, without structure, without rules. Now, all I have is time. All I have is silence. Staying busy is the only thing that keeps me sane. The world is much simpler now. As far as I can remember, next week will be six years to the day the world ended, and my heart stopped beating. I haven't seen anyone, spoken to anyone, touched anyone since then. I just wish I had someone to talk to. (birds singing) The days, the weeks come and go without notice. Why am I still here? (birds chirping) (water splashing) (click, click) (click, click) (click, click) solar piece of shit. (electrical humming, stops) Piece of shit! (clanks, kicks) (electrical humming) (thud) (ominous music) (tense music) (crickets chirping) Voiceover: Don't (sobbing) look (sobbing) away. (sobbing) (gasp) (tense music) (birds singing) (slow piano music) (thunder) (rain falling) (thunder) (thunder) Ghostly voice: Run. (bang) (bang) (bang) (bang) (bang) (bang) (creak, bang) (creak, bang) (creak, bang) (bang) (bang) (bang) (bang) (rain, thunder) (tense music) (thunder) Lily! (tense music) Lily: No! I got it. Sarah: Are you sure? Lily: Really, I'm fine. Sarah: Okay. If you need anything, I'll be right outside. (rain, thunder) (knock, knock, knock) Hey. I thought you might be hungry. We have so much to talk about. (thunder, rain) What happened to you? (click) (squeak) (heartbeat, heavy breathing) Dad? Dad? Dad? Daddy? Lily: Daddy! (thud) (sobbing) Sarah: It's okay. Shh, it's okay. it's over. (sobbing) It's okay. It's over. Lily: It's not over. It's never over. (melancholic music) (sobbing) (birds singing) (crunch) (squeak, bang) Sarah: I know it isn't much but, it's what we've got. You really should eat something. Lily: You sound just like dad. Sarah: Well, he was always right. Lily: And now he's dead. (sigh) Sarah: Come on. Don't be an ass. (birds singing) Okay, let it out. Yell, scream, curse, do whatever you want. Lily: And why would I do that? Sarah: It helps. Trust me. Ahhhh! Lily: Okay, yeah. Not helping. Are you done? Sarah: Come on, do it. Please? Lily: Ahhh. Sarah: Really? Lily: What? Sarah: There's no one around for miles. Okay, there's no one around at all. That was a cop-out whimper. (pleasant music) Lily: Ahhhh! Sarah: (laughs) Damn. Lily: Better? Sarah: Better? (chuckles) Ow. Did that help? Lily: No. It was fun, though. Sarah: Again? Lily: AHHH! Sarah: AHHH! (slow piano music) Lily: You don't play the piano. Sarah: No, I don't but, I've had a lot of time on my hands. I still remember that recital. We were both so excited because there was supposed to be some bigwig college dancer there that we were all trying to impress. Lily: Community college, and you totally fell on your ass. Sarah: (laughs) Dad framed it anyway. Lily: Dad would have framed a Happy Meal if you'd let him, And that college guy was hot. (laughing) Sarah: Yeah. We should dance. What? We should do something fun. Lily: We're not 10 anymore. I don't do Happy Meals, hopscotch, or horse shit. Sarah: What the hell is wrong with you? Lily: You know damn well what's wrong with me. (apprehensive music) Sarah: Why won't you talk to me? Lily: We are talking. Sarah: No, I mean really? Lily: Same reason you won't talk to me, really. There's nothing to say. Sarah: You were a really good dancer. (crickets chirping) (electrical humming) (ptooey) I have to go kick something, be right back. (ominous music) You okay? Lily: Don't go outside. Sarah: Okay. (wind chimes chiming) (foreboding music) (wind chimes) Ominous voice: Don't. Look. Away. (gunshot) (heavy breathing) (tense music) (birds singing) (sobbing) (grunt) (tarp rustling) (water splashing) (birds singing) (blissful music) I don't know what to write. Lily: Don't write anything. Here, sit down. I got this. Sarah: Can I talk to you, really? Lily: Did you kill him? Sarah: Am I going to hell? Lily: Maybe we're already there. Tell you what though, next time you see the first man in six years, try not to shoot him, okay? Sarah: I wanted to finish the dress. Lily: I was going to ask you about that. Sarah: I'm so close, but I can't even hold a needle right now. So close it's really starting to piss me off. Lily: Oh, is that what you're all worked up over? Ah, hey. Sarah: Ow. Lily: Chill out, I'm almost done. Then you'll be all set for prom. Sarah: I don't know what I was thinking. I never got to go to prom, never got to wear it. I guess I just thought that ... Lily: That you might still have a chance some day. (fretful music) (wind chimes chiming) (wind chimes chiming) (wind chimes chiming, crashing) (wind chimes chiming) (foreboding music) Ghostly voice: Run. (crash) Lily: Sarah? Are you okay? Are you okay? Sarah: Yeah. I'm fine, just couldn't sleep. Lily: What were you doing? Sarah: Just a little ... Redecorating. Lily: Redecorating? (thud) Redecorating? Sarah: Yeah. I just kind of tugged, and it came right down. (knock, knock) (knock, knock, knock) (tense music) (knock, knock, knock) Ryan: Hello. Is anyone here? Sarah: No. Ryan: That wasn't very convincing. Sarah: What do you want? Ryan: Are you Sarah? Sarah: Who are you? Ryan: Well, right now, I'm just a guy standing on your porch. (tense music) Sarah: So why are you standing on my porch? Ryan: Well, I was hoping to get invited in, eventually. Sarah: Do I know you? Ryan: Not really. We met awhile back. I drew your picture. Do you remember me? Sarah: Not really. Ryan: Can I come in? I kind of came a long way to chat with you; but after that, I'll be on my way. I promise. Sarah: Take your shoes off. Lily: Are you fucking insane? Sarah: What is wrong with you? Lily: What's wrong with me? Get that guy out of here, now. God, are you really that out of it? Did you already forget what happened less than two days ago? Sarah: I know. Lily: Get him out. Sarah: He has a picture. I think we met before. Lily: A picture? Of you? Do you even know him? Okay, stop. After six years here, a few days ago, a random guy shows up sneaking around the house. Two days later, a second guy shows up. That doesn't seem at all strange to you? Sarah: He seems like a nice guy. Lily: And you're the judge of that after a 30-second conversation? What happens if he finds out? (tense music) Send him away, now. (thud) Ryan: I love what you've done with the place. Sarah: Remodeling. Ryan: Remodeling? Sarah: It was old. So what did you want to tell me? Ryan: is it okay if we sit, maybe? Sarah: Yeah. For a minute. Sorry, it's been a long time since I've had visitors. Ryan: How long has it been, exactly? Sarah: Since the world, everything changed. Six years? Ryan: Been out here alone for six years? Sarah: Look, I know you came a long way from wherever- Ryan: You realize that the world didn't end, right? I mean, a lot changes in six years, but there's still people, cities. Sorry, that's, that's strangely enough not what I came here to say. To be honest, I don't know the best way to say this. I've been working up to it for quite a while, but it, it's still going to sound a bit weird. Please, just don't freak out when I say this. Bear with me till I'm finished. What I'm trying to say is, I haven't been able to stop thinking about you since the first time I saw you. All I had was the picture. I didn't know your name. (dramatic music) I've been looking for you for, well, since then. Sarah: Do you want a glass of water, or anything? Ryan: Sure. (clunk) (water pouring, splashing) Everything okay in there? Everything okay? Sarah: Uh, yeah. Sorry, here. I'll be right back. Um, do you want to stay for dinner? Ryan: Sure. Lily: Dinner? Sarah: Did you hear what he said? Lily: It's a bunch of bullshit. If I were him, I'd say whatever the hell I needed to just to get a free meal. I don't like him. Sarah: Okay, so he's a little weird, but who wouldn't be these days? He doesn't seem like a bad guy. Lily: We don't know anything about him, and now he's wandering freely around our house. Sarah: He's been here less than five minutes, and he's professing his love for you. Even if everything he says is true, six years looking for you? That's creepy as hell. There's something really off about this guy. (tense music) Sarah: He looks familiar to you too, doesn't he? Ryan: It's been awhile since I had a sit-down meal with anyone. Sarah: Yeah, it's sort of a tradition thing for me, consistency. Have a seat. Ryan: Will somebody else be joining us? Sarah: Uh, I keep thinking Lily is going to join us. Ryan: Lily? Sarah: My sister. Ryan: I didn't know you had a sister. Lily: I didn't know she had a boyfriend. Ryan: So it's just you and your sister? Sarah: Uh, yeah. (utensils clatter) Um, well, my dad too, but, Sorry, it's a touchy subject. Ryan: Don't worry about it. Sarah: So, you draw. Ryan: I do. It started out as more of a hobby really, then I realized people seemed to think they weren't too bad. They say I have the ability to capture the soul of a person. Sarah: Oh, that's quite the compliment. Ryan: Eh, I've traveled with small amusement parks, set up on street corners, local fairs. I wouldn't exactly call it a major accomplishment. (chuckles) I love looking at people and, and capturing what I see. Sarah: You're an artist. From that sketch you showed me, not a bad one at that. Ryan: You're an artist too, I gather. Sarah: What makes you say that? Ryan: I sat in your living room for almost an hour, and there's pictures on the walls, a piano in the corner. (chuckle) Do you still dance? Sarah: My dad made me take lessons. My sister was really the dancer. I always thought music, or maybe writing, would be my thing, but I never really tried it till it didn't matter anymore. Wait, you got all of that from a picture and a piano? Ryan: To be fair, people watching is also a hobby of mine. I used to sit in parks, or even malls, and just watch how people live, how they interact with one another. Mothers yelling at their sons to behave, or teenagers prancing around on their cell phones, and daddy's credit cards, (chuckling) sisters bickering, fathers shopping for their would-be lovers. You know, each has their own story, their own response to each situation, to joy and fear, love, and hate, life and death. (tense music) You can read each feeling in a tone of voice, or a look, a smile, a tear. Sarah: It must be hard now. Ryan: What do you think happened? Sarah: You mean the world ending? Ryan: The world didn't end. Sarah: People died. Explosions, gunfire, I was there. Ryan: Yeah, so was I. Things change, they always do. Life goes on. The world didn't end. The people are still there. The cities are still there, like they always have been. Lily: Bullshit. That is complete bullshit. We were there, we were both there. I don't know what kind of shit you're trying to pull, but that's enough. Sarah: it is a little hard to believe. Ryan: I have no reason to lie to you. Lily: Are you kidding me? Ryan: Let me take you there. It's only about a days' walk from here. Lily: I'm not going anywhere with this guy. Ryan: When was the last time that you went more than five miles away from this farm? Sarah: Ryan, excuse me for a minute. What the hell are you doing? Lily: What, are you serious? Did you hear what he just said? Sarah: Come on. And yes, I did. Lily: You and I both lived through that. Do you have any idea how insane he sounds? Sarah: I do, I get it, but what if he's telling the truth? He said it's a days' walk. Isn't it worth just a day? Lily: Are you kidding me? So we're going to go on a days' hike through the wilderness with some guy who people watches and captures pictures of their souls? Sarah: Okay, so he's a little weird. Lily: I know how badly you want to like this guy, believe me, I do, but think logically for just one second. He shows up, on foot, in dirty clothes with an old bag. I mean, if what he says is true, and everything is just fine and dandy, why didn't he just drive a Range Rover up the driveway? Or land a helicopter in the back yard? Sarah: A helicopter? Lily: What's more likely? The entire world was rebuilt overnight or this guy found an address and a picture and thought he might get something out of it? What if that other guy was his buddy? You going to shoot this one too? Sarah: Don't. Lily: You know I'm right. Sarah: Okay, so let's say for one minute that you are right, and I'm not saying you are, what do we do about it now? Lily: Tell him no. Tell him to leave. Sarah: If you are right, what's the likelihood he's just going to leave? Lily: I told you not to let him in. Sarah: Just lock your door tonight. Lily: What do you mean tonight? Talk to him right now. Sarah: Why don't you tell him? Lily: You did this, you fix it. Sarah: Look, I'm sorry about tonight. I just need to sleep on it. Ryan: Don't worry about it. Sarah: You sure you're okay on the couch? Ryan: Yeah. I've had worse. (slow, dramatic music) Sarah: Okay. Well, I'll see you in the morning. Ryan: Good night. Lily: This is a bad idea. Sarah: In the morning. (slam) (slam) (crickets chirping) Ryan: Oh! Sarah: Ah! Ryan: Whoa, whoa. Sarah: What the hell are you doing out here? Ryan: Would you believe going for a walk? Sarah: In the middle of the night? It's pitch black. Ryan: And what were you doing? Sarah: Going for a walk. Ryan: (laughs) Yeah. That's what I figured. Actually, I saw you sneak by, and just wanted to see what was up. Is everything okay? Sarah: Yeah. Ryan: You sure? Sarah: Mm. I'm tired. Ryan: Hey. Did you want this? Sarah: Yeah. Thanks. ( melancholic music) (music turns tense) Voiceover: Don't look away. (gunshot) (birds singing) Where's Ryan? How long has he been out there? (snort) Have you been in the shed recently? Lily: Are you kidding? I don't go anywhere near it. Sarah: Keep an eye on him. Make sure he stays in the front of the house. The shed door is open. Lily: Hey, I ain't moving till he moves. Do we have any coffee? (foreboding music) Sarah: It's gone. Lily: What do you mean, it's gone? Sarah: It's gone, as in gone. Have you been in the shed since ... Lily: (scoffs) No. Sarah: I ran into Ryan outside last night. Lily: Wait, you ran into Ryan outside last night? What was he do- Wait, what were you doing outside last night? Sarah: I was- Okay, I can't find the gun. Lily: You lost the gun? That's a joke, right? You lost the frickin' gun when you ran into Ryan outside last night? And now the body of the man you killed is just magically gone. Well, this is going to be a fantastic day. I'm glad we waited, aren't you? Sarah: What is he doing? Lily: Watching us watch him. Sarah: It's okay, I'm going to talk to him. Lily: Now? Sarah: Do you have a better idea? (door slams) What are you doing out here? Ryan: Watching. Sarah: Watching what? Ryan: You. Sarah: Me? Ryan: The way you move, the way you walk, the way your hair flutters in the breeze, the way your eyes say everything you're feeling. Something's wrong. Sarah: We, I can't go with you. Ryan: I see. You know, I wasn't lying when I said I couldn't stop thinking about you. The first time I saw you was in the main square downtown. You were there with your father by the fountains, and you were wearing this, this purple blouse and white, flowing skirt, and laughing at what I can only guess was a really dumb joke of his. You were trying so hard to make him think that he was funny, (light music) but all he really cared about was spending the time with you. And all you wanted was for him to stay. (romantic music) (music turns ominous) Sarah: I can't. Lily: You can't what? Sarah: I can't tell him to go. Lily: You can't or you won't? Sarah: He'll be in in a minute. Lily: Sarah. This is wrong, and you know it. Sarah: You don't know that. Lily: If you don't throw him out, I will. Sarah: I want him to stay. Lily: What has he done to you? Sarah: Nothing. (sad music) Ryan: So this just fell? Sarah: I may have given it a tug. Ryan: (chuckles) A tug? So was there a reason why it's attached to a wind chime? Lily: It's how I find the drafts. (wind chimes chiming) (loud chop) Sarah: Lily! Really? Lily: I don't trust him. Sarah: (sigh) Give it a rest. (loud chop) Lily: He really got to you, didn't he? Sarah: Why can't you just let it go? Lily: Let it go? He's manipulating you. Can't you tell? Sarah: Why are you so ... Oh my god, you're jealous. Lily: What? Wait, I have this all wrong. You're the crazy one, not him. I'm going to end this, someone has to. Sarah: No you won't. Lily! (tense music) Lily: Ryan, I think Sarah would like to tell you about something she lost in the shed. Sarah: I lost a necklace. Ryan: Lost a necklace? Lily: A 200 pound necklace covered in a big tarp. Okay, how about this? Sarah, have you ever killed anyone? Sarah: Have you? Ryan: It depends, which one you're looking for, necklace. (music lightens up) Sarah: I'm sorry about that. Ryan: (chuckles) It's a chandelier. It was bugging me. (apprehensive music) (turns to romantic music) Lily: No! no. Somebody, please somebody! Help me, please! Somebody! No, no, no, no, no, no. Sarah: Lily, Lily! Lily: Somebody please help me, please! No, no. (thud) (crash) Somebody! No, no, no, no. Get him out of here. I don't want him anywhere near me. Sarah: Lily, put down the knife. Lily: I remember you. Get out, get out! Sarah: Go. It's okay, go. He's going. It's okay. Lily: It's not okay. Sarah: Lily, put down the knife. You just had another nightmare. It's okay. Lily: It's not okay! You're not listening. Sarah: Okay, I'm listening. I'm listening. Lily: No you're not. You still don't remember. (music turns melancholic) You don't know what you're doing. (tense music) It's not over. Get out. Sarah: Look, I'm sorry about dad, but that has nothing to do with- Lily: Get out. Ryan: How you feeling? Sarah: How am I feeling? Great. Look, I'm sorry about tonight. It was- I'll make it up to you. Ryan: No rush. We've got all the time in the world. (sad music) (birds singing) (thuds, crash) (wind chimes chiming) (foreboding music) (grunting) Lily: I knew you weren't listening, (grunting, sobbing) but I bet you are now. I said to stay away from him. (breathing fast, grunting) Turn him away right at the start. (sobbing) But you didn't listen then either. (sobbing) You don't love him. (crying) You don't even know him. He'll be the end of everything. (crying) He wouldn't want you to get hurt. (sobbing) Why do you want him so much? (crying) By the way, I think it's great he goes out for his long, weird walks, If you can even call them that. It's a wonderful chance for us to really talk. Watch out for all that glass. (grunting, sobbing) (fast breathing) (ominous music) It's time for him to go. (gasp) By the way, that is a really pretty dress. (squish) (gasping, sobbing) (gasping) (melancholic music) (crying) Ryan: What happened? (crying) Sarah: Where's Lily? (music turns ominous) Ryan: What Lily? Sarah: My sister, Lily. Ryan: There is no Lily. Sarah: I stabbed her. I didn't mean to, she made me. Ryan: You need to relax. Sarah: (crying) No. Ryan: If you don't take this, you're going to keep bleeding. Sarah: Where's Lily? Ryan: You don't have a sister. You never did. There is no Lily. (tense music) Sarah: What the hell are you talking about? She was just here. She tried to kill me. Ryan: From what I can tell, you fell down the stairs and landed on the chandelier. You're lucky to be alive. Sarah: She was right, you are crazy. Ow! Ryan: Okay, I know that this is hard for you to understand, but there is no Lily. There never was, you never had a sister. Sarah: She interrupted us last night, screaming. She nearly stabbed- Ryan: You ran away from me last night, then pounded on a locked door, then freaked out and told me to leave. Look, I get it. You've been out here a long time alone. Sarah: She was right, you'll say anything. (crying) Ryan: That is not a good idea. Sarah: What did you do with her? Ryan: No, no. Sarah: Lily? Lily! Stay away from me! Lily! Lily! Ryan: Look who's in this picture. (tense music) Sarah: No. I don't know what you're trying to do, but you need to leave. Ryan: Look at them. All of them. Look! (tense music) They're exactly how they've always been, and deep down you know it. (sobbing) Let's get cleaned up, okay? Okay. (sobs) (water running) Sarah: I'm fine. I'm fine, I got it. Ryan: Sure. Sarah: I said I got it. (crickets chirping) I want to go, now. Ryan: Where? Sarah: You said you're from the city. I want to go. Ryan: You want to go? Are you sure? Whoa, hey, whoa, whoa. Okay, we'll go. We'll go, but not tonight. It's at least a full days' hike, and you can barely walk. Sarah: I can't stay here. Ryan: Okay, look. We'll sleep here the night, and then, if you're up to it, we'll head out first thing tomorrow. Sarah: No. Ryan: You've been out here a long time, I think you can handle one more night. I'll be right here. (tensive music) (music turns ominous) Lily: Run. (gunshot) (birds singing) (melancholic music) (music turns ominous) Ryan: Ready? Sarah: Yeah. (music turns apprehensive) (wind chimes chiming) Sarah: So if Lily isn't real, what did you do with the body? Ryan: What? Sarah: The body, in the shed? Ryan: There's a body in the shed? Sarah: The guy I shot. Ryan: Are you telling me you killed a man? Sarah: Stop playing dumb. I came outside, the door was open, and it was gone. Ryan: I find it very hard to believe that you shot someone, or even that you'd be able to. Sarah: You think I made that up too? Ryan: Not necessarily. What'd he look like? Sarah: What'd he look like? How did you really find me? I never had a drawing made of me. Ryan: I never said you paid to have it done. Sarah: So what, you were stalking me? (ominous music) Ryan: Not exactly. Sarah: Exactly. Ryan: I saw you in the park, I drew a picture. I don't see what's wrong with this. Sarah: And then you chase me down six years later? Ryan: First of all, it hasn't been six years since anything. Secondly, that wasn't that last time I saw you. Sarah: You were stalking me. Ryan: Not really. Well, maybe a little. You really don't remember, do you? Sarah: Who the hell are you? Ryan: Don't look away. Do you remember? (gasping) Sarah: Ah! (melancholic music) Jim: Hey. Happy fourth. Sarah: It's the wrong holiday. (fireworks exploding) Come on, we're going to miss everything. (fireworks exploding) (music turns ominous) Jim: Run! Run! (gunshot) (fireworks) (foreboding music) (sobbing) (sobbing) (stab) (crying) (squish) (sobbing) (squish) (crying) (music turns dark) (sobbing) Ryan: Don't look away. (sobbing) Don't look away. Sarah: I still remember.
