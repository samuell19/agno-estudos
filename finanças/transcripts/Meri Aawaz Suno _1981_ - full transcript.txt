Millions of years ago our world was a ball of fire. Ages passed, rains poured from the clouds, cooling this ball of fire. Life emerged. One of them was humans. Humans divided this planet into parts and distributed them. Declared their reign. Different countries were formed. Different kingdoms were born. The ruling kings, emperors and noblemen grew arrogant trampling the poor under their feet. The world was divided into two kinds of people: Those who ruled and those who were ruled. That refers to the king and his subjects. This is a fictional kingdom within an imaginary country and it's name is Bagalpur. This is Bagalpur's capital, Rickshawpur. This state has celebrated its 100th month of independence, and to mark this occasion, the entire state has been illuminated with fireworks. To mask the darkness with the façade of light, governments were established to rule the public. And within each government, there were ministers in various roles. When the era of kings and emperors came to an end, the era of self-rule emerged. Meaning, the current era in which we live. Self-governance is governance by and for the people. Our tale revolves around an imaginary nation. About a fictional country that has no existence in reality. We've given the name "Mundustaan" to this country. This is a fictional nation. There's self-rule here as well. This is the protagonist of our fictitious tale. Sushil Kumar, a courageous, patriotic, and honest police officer. And this is CBI Officer, Mr. Sangram Singh. This is Mr. Papayya Lal, the Minister of this state. This is Secretary of the State, Mr. Madan. And this is lnspector General of Police Shankar Kumar. She is Inspector Sushil Kumar's wife, Sunita. And she is Sushil Kumar's Mother, Kamini Devi. Congratulations. The country is proud of your bravery and honesty. And we anticipate that you will carry out your duties with the same level of integrity and create a lasting impact. Make the nation proud. Sir, I assure you that I would choose to sacrifice my life before compromising the honor of this uniform. Very good. Bravo. Thank you, sir. Sushil, congratulations. - Thank you, sir. You didn't even glance at me after receiving your bravery award. Sunita, I’m really happy today. I haven't received this award. It has been given to this mother's son. Kulwant? - Yes, sir? Hurry, I need to talk about something crucial. I’ll be right there. - Yes, sir? Come, Kulwant. Do you know him? - Yes, Sir. Everyone knows about him. He's the infamous criminal Kanwarlal who has been a major challenge for the police for several years. Now, he's in jail. - Yes! Now, just imagine for a while that Kanwarlal doesn't have a beard or these features. Then who will he resemble? He looks like my friend, Sub-Inspector Sushil Kumar. Exactly like Sushil Kumar. - Right! You're absolutely right. Kulwant, I want to meet Sushil Kumar tomorrow. Here. - How long will you worship these idols? You want a child, don't you? Then ask me. Why do you waste your time here? Don't mock God. - Fine, I won't mock God. But I can at least love my wife. Someone might see us. - So what? You're my lawfully wedded wife. I didn't elope with you. - No. Fine, not here. Sit on the motorcycle, I’ll take you home. We'll talk there. Come on, let's go. Listen. That's why I don't go out. You send me to the temple while you begin working yourself. Mother, you are not well. The doctor has asked you to take rest. Giving rest to the body is futile. Fulfill my desire, then I swear on you. I’ll never work again. I will never work again. Really? Tell me what can I do for you? Give me a grandson. I will play with him all day. I won't do any work even if you ask. - Really? God has answered your prayers. You'll soon get what you want. - What? Really? Really?. I’m going to be grandma? - Yes. I’m going to be grandma? - Yes. You'll give birth to my grandson. You've fulfilled the desires of my life. You've fulfilled the desires of my life. Here, open your mouth. Open your mouth. You gave a successor to this family... ... before I breathed my last. Listen. Does Sushil know that he's going to be a father? No. Wait. I’ll tell him. - Mother. Listen. Sushil. Sushil. Sushil. What's wrong, Mother?. Open your mouth. Open my mouth? - Why?. Mom, why are you building up the suspense? Here, I opened my mouth. Sweets. - Yes. But why? - God has answered my prayers. Did you receive a telegram? - Yes, I have. Where is it? - Sunita has it. I’m going to be a grandma. Grandma! Then why distribute sweets if you're going to be a grandma? Who made you a police officer? You fool, you're going to be a father. So what if I’m. I’ll be right back. Sunita. Sunita. Sunita. Sunita. Sunita, open the door. I have some exciting news to share with you. Did you hear? I'm going to be a grandma! I mean, I’m going to be father. Sunita. ♫ What are you thinking about? I’m thinking about something. What are you thinking about? I’m thinking about something. I was thinking that it would be a boy. I was thinking that it would be a boy. I will name him Sanju. I was thinking that it would be a girl. I will name her Manju. It will be a boy. It will be a girl. It will be a boy. - No, no, it will be a girl. I was thinking that it would be a girl. I will call her Manju. I was thinking that it would be a boy. I will call him Sanju. No, no, It will be a girl. - It will be a boy. No, no, It will be a girl. - It will be a boy. Girls cry a lot. Girls cry a lot. She doesn't sleep and keeps everyone awake. I’ll stay awake with her and you can sleep peacefully. I’ll go crazy if I sleep alone everyday. It will be a boy. - No, it will be a girl. No, it will be a boy. - No, no, it will be a girl. Boys are very strange. They trouble the neighbours with their mischief. Boys are very strange. They trouble the neighbours with their mischief. I’ll be his father and you his mother. But who will call him brother? So, It will be a girl. - No, it will be a boy. No, it will be a girl. - No, it will be a boy. Don't trouble me, let me go. Don't twist my arm. Close your beautiful eyes. Don't trouble me, let me go. Don't twist my arm. Close your beautiful eyes. Let's end this battle, and declare a truce. The night is passing away. Fine, then lets have two. - Two together? Manju and Sanju together. First, it'll be a girl and then the boy. First it'll be a boy and then the girl. Girl first. - Boy first. Girl first. - Boy first. Boy! - Boy! Boy! - Girl! Boy! - Girl! ♫ Sushil Kumar, we want to entrust you... ...with an immensely important responsibility. If you succeed then you will not only save this department, but also protect our country and its people from a grave threat. I’m ready, sir. Give me the orders. Sushil, there is a very dangerous gang in this country. They have a racket. Printing counterfeit currency, smuggling diamonds, silver, pearls and gold. And involved in the trafficking of young girls to foreign nations. This gang and their criminal activities, are spreading throughout our country like a malignant cancer. Actually, it's a shameful disgrace for our department, that despite having concrete evidence, we find ourselves unable to take any action. Why haven't they been arrested when... ...we have undeniable evidence against them? Sushil, attacking shadows won't inflict harm upon the body. These people whom we have evidence against... ...are merely puppets. We want to catch the puppeteers controlling them. And they are influential people. - I see. Sushil, I have hatched a plan. If we succeed in this plan, then I’m sure... ...we can apprehend those influential people. Give me the orders. I’ll do my best to make that plan successful. Sushil, a highly dangerous criminal named Kanwarlal, who is currently serving his prison sentence. He's a very stern person. He isn't just stern but a dreadful beast. The uncrowned king of the underworld. I have a hunch that this man has some connection with that gang. The police made their best efforts to get Kanwarlal to confess. We administered severe punishment to him. However, Kanwarlal did not disclose any information. I have seen one ray of hope in this darkness of despair. You bear a strong resemblance to Kanwarlal. - What? Yes. If you modify your appearance to resemble him, no one would be able to differentiate between Kanwarlal and Sushil Kumar. Terrific idea. That means I would need to dress up in a manner similar to him. Imitate his habits, lifestyle and flee from jail, and join hands with that gang. And bring you all the evidence that I find there. Exactly! Will you be able to do it? My mother's desire was that I become a police officer. I have fulfilled my mother's desire, but I still have another mother to serve: My motherland. Her desire is that I eradicate the sins and crimes occurring on her land. So, how can this son refuse? Wow, this department and the country take immense pride in having a mother who gave birth to a son like you. Sushil, "Operation End" commences from today. Which means "Antim Karavahi" (Final Measures). This is your look-alike, Kanwarlal. He is Halkatlal, the proprietor of a club. Before Kanwarlal was sent to jail, he would frequently meet with Halkatlal. His name is Dawood. Kanwarlal would visit him frequently. He's Ronnie. The owner of Hotel Tiptop. Any questions? - Sir, before I commence "Operation End" or "Antim Karavahi," I would like to visit Kanwarlal. Okay. Kulwant. Yes, sir. Take Sushil to Central Jail and I will contact Prison Warden Khanna - Okay, sir. Okay, Sir. - All the best. Sushil, consider it carefully once again. By accepting this mission, you have invited your own demise. God forbid if anything happens to you, have you thought what will happen to your mother? What about your wife? - What do you think will happen? I have a dear friend named Kulwant. He'll look after my mother. He'll take care of his sister-in-law. Look, don't be stubborn. I’m not being stubborn, Kulwant. I have a dream, and I’m trying to fulfill it. The dream of my sister's tragedy. - Sister? Yes, Kulwant. I have a sister. A sister whose sight would make me forget all my worries. Brother! Brother! Brother! Look, I brought Kumar along to introduce him to you. Kumar, this is my brother Sushil. Shobha. - Kumar, this is my mother. Hello, Aunty. - Hello. Bless you. Take a seat. - Sit down, Brother. So, Brother, was I right about him? How do you like my choice? But Shobha, we'll need to look into everything. What do his parents do? What is his family like? Kumar comes from a large family. His father is a prominent gold merchant. I've looked into everything, Brother. After all, I’m your sister. Mr. Kumar. - Yes? I would like the to meet your parents before we fix this alliance. Sushil, its been quite a while... and we haven't heard from Shobha. Don't worry, Mother. I’m going over to see her. I've already bought so many firecrackers. I'll bring her over here, and we'll have a grand celebration for Diwali. Yes my son. Ever since she left, this house has felt lonely. Mother, I will return soon with her. Who is it? Who are you looking for? Mr. Kumar resides here, Could you let me know where he is? Don't you know? That fraudster has fled the country. I've heard that he would deceive innocent girls and traffic them to foreign countries for sale. Three girls from the neighbourhood are missing. The police are searching for them. Let's see what happens. Later I found out that marriage was a fraud. That boy, his parents, were involved in selling my sister to a gang for the pleasure of the wealthy and influential individuals. On that day, I made the decision to join the police force and to rescue my sister from that gang. I've finally got that opportunity, Kulwant. I was refusing you at first, Sushil. But I’m saying this myself, don't lose this opportunity. Find those criminals and exact revenge for our sister and many others like her. Seek justice, Sushil. Show them no mercy. Yes, sir. Bahadur, this is Inspector Sushil Kumar. Hello. - Hello. Take him to Kanwarlal. Kanwarlal. Could you find only me for this job? Sir, even passing by his cell makes me tremble with fear, and you're asking me to go inside his cell? Bahadur! What Bahadur, sir?! My parents mistakenly named me Bahadur (Brave) and this is the consequence. Stop your nonsense and escort the visitor! What a predicament! Come, sir. What can I do if someone deliberately wants to enter inside the jaws of death? Go ahead. He won't let you escape unharmed. Bye, see you. - He won't let you go. Sir, I want to ask you a question. - What? Sir, pass me a cigarette. Shut up, you fool! Sir, could you please tell me about your family members? Mother, wife. Why? - Just asking. Do you have any savings in their names? - Why? Once you go inside you won't come out alive. Take a look. I simply stood outside his cell and politely, with a smile, "Good morning, Mr. Kanwar." That idiot Kanwar brutally assaulted me. You're laughing? Laugh. Laugh, you should laugh before dying. That way the soul feels content. Come, this way. Come. Sir, one minute, one minute. Do you have any last wish? Quiet, open it. I’ll open it, but at least tell me. After you die, should I take your corpse to your home, or directly to the crematorium? - Shut up! Open the door. I will. I will. Dear God. I’m opening it. One minute. Last one minute. Take this. - What is this? Bandages. This is my final gift to you. Keep it, you'll need it inside. ldiot! - By God. He's gone. Good morning, Kanwar. - Bastard! Call me Kanwarlal! - Fine. Good morning, Kanwarlal. I work as a journalist, contributing articles to multiple newspapers. I want to ask you whether the police treats the prisoners humanely or not? And if not then we should let the entire country know about it. Lower your voice, bastard! I've seen many such charades from the police. You can fool others with your facade but not Kanwarlal. Kanwarlal can identify the police by their distinct odor. There is a peculiar odor associated with police officers... ...and that's coming from you. Drop the act and get out of here! Otherwise, I’ll tear you apart! Impressive, Kanwarlal. I accept you aren't just brave but also intelligent. I truly am a police inspector. My name is Sushil Kumar. Cigarette. Okay. Bahadur. Bahadur. - Yes. Come inside. - No, no. I said come inside. Release his handcuffs. I said open his handcuffs. What are you saying, sir? He did this to me with his handcuffs on. If I were to remove his handcuffs, he would demolish these solid walls and escape from here. Will you remove his handcuffs or not? I’m shaking. Oh God. He's dead. Do you recognise this man, Kanwarlal? You want me to confess over a cigarette? No, Kanwarlal. I’m only asking. You do know Dawood, don't you? You're still a child. Many strict inspectors before you tried to make Kanwarlal confess. They tortured me as much as they could. They kept torturing me. But lost hope. But Kanwarlal didn't reveal a word. Instead, he laughed at every wound. He gave only one answer to every question. "I don't know anything." Are you trying to appeal to my emotions by using sympathy? No, Kanwarlal. I’m not here to ask, but to inform you. I've heard that you and Dawood were very close. I can imagine it's tough for you to come to terms with his passing. What? Dawood. Uncle Dawood is dead? No, no, you're lying. You're lying, you bastard! - No, Kanwarlal, it's the truth. I was responsible for Dawood's demise. You killed my uncle, my father. You murdered my father! I'll kill you! Get up! Get up, asshole! Bastard, I’ll kill you. That's a miracle. He's beating him. Kanwarlal is being brutally beaten. Get up. Get up, Kanwarlal. Get up. Thank you very much, Kanwarlal. I kept my mouth shut. But your heart made you reveal everything. I only wanted to know whether you share a good rapport with Dawood or not? You revealed it to me yourself. By the way, your uncle Dawood isn't dead he is still alive. You asshole. Sushil, here's your ticket for London. - London? Yes, you're going to London. - What for? For the world to see. Everyone will be under the impression that you're in London. Even our department shouldn't know about it. Understand? - Yes, I understand. I’m going to London. No, no! I won't let you go. Listen. - There's nothing to listen to. This is a strange job. I hardly get to see you when you're doing your duty here. If you go to London I won't get to see you for months. I won't let you go. - Come on... ...it's just a matter of a few days. And you should be happy. You know, your husband was selected. from the entire department for such a major responsibility. Isn't that good news? What is this? Strange. I’m going so far away. It's said that you should see-off your husband with a smile. And you've made such a sullen face and you're shedding tears. Smile. Smile. That's like a good girl. Take me along. Where should I take you? As I chase down criminals, will you be chasing after me? One more thing. The other day we were being obstinate. I was saying it'll be a boy and you were saying it'll be a girl. Fine, I lose and you win. It'll be a girl, but on one condition. She should be like you. A beautiful face, fair complexion. Doe-like eyes. Yes. Like this. If we put you in a machine and shrink you then you'll look just like this. And I want my child to be just like...sorry. Just like this. Bless you. My blessings are with you, son. I’ll pray for you to return successful. My friend, my mother and wife are your responsibility now. Look after them. - There's no need for you to mention that. Good luck. - I’m leaving. What is this, Sunita? You're crying again. - Sushil, I can't live without you. Enough, Sunita. Forget Sushil for a few days and look after our child that you're carrying. I’ll ask for him as soon as I return. Smile. Come on smile. I’ll leave. Take these letters. Keep sending them to my house via London. Okay sir. - Bye. ldiot, you won't become a lion by donning its skin. lnspector, if you really are brave, if your mother is truly a virtuous woman, and if you're her legitimate son, then go to Halkatlal's club and scream at the top of your voice: Halkatlal, I’m Kanwar. ldiot, call me Kanwarlal! Kanwarlal! Kanwar, you've made a significant statement You've asked me to prove my mother's virtuousness. and my legitimacy. So, I swear on my mother's virtuousness, that if I don't succeed in eradicating those criminals and handing them over to the law, then I’m not the son of a virtuous mother. Take him away. - Yes, sir. Come. Sir, please pray that I dismantle the world of crime and bring its perpetrators down on their knees before you. I will anxiously await that day, Sushil. All the best. - Thank you, sir. Okay, good luck, Sushil. - Thank you. Bahadur. - Yes, sir. Go lock him up in his cell. No, Sir, you take him. You take him. You take him. What can I do? I’m a government servant. I’m on duty. I would have let you to go, but it's my duty. I don't want any more injuries. The earlier wounds haven't healed yet. Go inside. He's so strong. I didn't do anything. Forgive me. Sir, Kanwarlal has escaped. - What? Kanwarlal has fled? Apprehend him! Hurry up! Kanwarlal has fled. Kanwarlal has fled. You were asking for one cigarette, weren't you? Keep the entire pack. Where is Halkatlal? Halkatlal? I don't know where he is. Hey, get out of here. Halkatlal. - Kanwar? ldiot! Call me Kanwarlal! Yes, Kanwarlal. But you still had ten years of imprisonment left. How did you get released so soon? Kanwarlal has the ability to elude death itself. Jail is not a significant matter. And I had to settle an old score with you. That's why I came here. Tell me, where is Uncle Dawood these days? I don't know. I had to compensate that poor man with Rs. 20,000. I searched extensively in various locations to find him and give him the money, but unfortunately, I couldn't find him anywhere. Perhaps his son has made a recovery in his health, and and he has departed from the world of crime and embraced a path of righteousness. You fool, whenever anyone enters the criminal world, there are only two eventual destinations for anyone who enters it. Either prison or the crematorium. Tell me where is uncle. Otherwise, I’ll send you to the other world. Tell me. - I’ll tell you. I’ll tell you. 26 Subedar Nagar, 9th Cross Road. He lives in a painting shop there. Bastard! You snake! You knew where uncle lived, but you didn't return his money. No! no! Let me go! Let me go please! Forgive me! No, no. You idiot. Take Rs. 30000 instead of 20000. Keep it as interest. But please spare me. Spare me. I never show mercy to idiots, and never charge anyone interest. Keep your Rs. 10000. You can use it for your last rites. I’m only taking uncle's Rs. 20000. And yes, if you tip off the police about me, I’ll strangle you to death before they catch me. Understood? - Yes, you'll strangle me to death. You understood it. Kanwarlal has escaped from prison, the police are looking for him. Kanwar? Kanwar my son? Hello, Uncle. - Hello. Uncle, how is your son? - He's still the same. Tell me, Kanwar, how did you escape the stronghold of the Wardha Jail? Everyone who tried succumbed to their death. Uncle, the prison walls consist of limestone, stone, and mud. Place me inside a steel trunk, weld it shut, and secure it with a lock. If I fail to escape from it, then my name isn't Kanwarlal. Fine, son. Abdul. - Yes, Uncle. Go get food from the hotel. Poor Kanwar must be hungry for a while. Here. Wait. Where will you get the food from? From the restaurant at the crossroad. Who will eat food from that restaurant? They use grease instead of ghee and kerosene instead of oil. Go to the restaurant close-by. Mention my name and ask for 4 plates of meatballs, 3 rice pilaffs, 12 roti smeared with ghee, and get pickled onions and lemon wedges. Here's the money, go. - Right away. Bravo. Uncle, take this. Kanwar, where did you get all this money from? This is your money, Uncle. - Mine? Yes, after fleeing from jail, I went straight to Halkatlal. Kicked his ass. Got your money and came straight here. Halkatlal is a bastard. He gets his work done and doesn't pay for it. That's okay, Uncle. You won't recognise him this time. I've beaten him so severely, that he'll remember it for the rest of his life. Forget it, son. The police are after you. Try to avoid engaging in conflicts with others from now on. Yes, Uncle, that's right. The police are after me. If I continue to stay with you, it may pose a problem for you. Where can I take you? Yes! There's one place where I can take you. That man can help us. He's right in front of me, yet I find it hard to believe. A man that stormed into the Central Bank in broad daylight, causing a massacre with a Sten gun, and subsequently escaped after robbing the bank. Next day, he murdered four officers within 24 hours, and his actions sent shockwaves through the government. The man who not only evaded the relentless pursuit of the entire country's police, but also managed to escape from prison, that is truly remarkable. Kanwar. - ldiot! Call me Kanwarlal. Kanwarlal's initial miracle occurred when he was brought into this world. Understand? However, I'm curious if Kanwarlal still possesses the same level of bravery, after his time in prison? Kanwarlal is inherently incapable of being a coward. If you doubt my bravery then I’ll leave right now. Wait, Kanwarlal. I'm glad that you took the time to see me. To join my gang. You're a valuable man, and I will inform you about your role tomorrow. Hand over the keys and you can leave. This is CID inspector Sunder. He came here with the intention of uncovering our secrets. Two more came before him, but faced the same consequence. Now, you have to dispose of his body. - It'll be done. But it'll cost you Rs. 10000. - Agreed. No, shell out the money. - Okay, okay. Here. And listen, meet me at Hotel Tiptop after the job's done. I’ll wait for you there. - Okay. And look, take this card. Once you present this, you will be granted respectful entry. Okay? - Okay. - Good luck. Hello, police station? Notorious criminal Kanwarlal, wanted by law enforcement a cross the entire country, is currently passing through G.B. Road in a blue imported vehicle. And Inspector Sunder's lifeless body is concealed in the trunk of that car. Don't ask questions, follow him. The car's number is TMW 7560. Yes? May I help you? Hey, Kanwar! ldiot, call me Kanwarlal. Speak to me in a respectful manner, Kanwarlal. Kanwarlal doesn't bother using manners with people who lack manners themselves. You bloody bastard! Thank you. - Okay. Kanwarlal, come on, have a drink with me. Scotch whiskey? Kanwarlal drinks XXX rum. Justin! He talks too much. Crush his pride and throw him at my feet so that he grovels for his life from me. Beg for life? From you? You're a beggar yourself. Who's going to beg from another beggar? My name is Topiwala. Do you know why? I have beheaded numerous arrogant men, trampled their heads, and kept their caps as souvenirs. But the game will be overturned, if you challenge Kanwarlal, Topiwala. Your head will be at my feet and I’ll have your hat as a souvenir. Justin! Well done, Justin! Keep it up! - Okay, boss. Kanwarlal, Justin has thrown you at my feet. Go! Wonderful, Kanwarlal! Wonderful! You are even braver than I had been told. It was not enmity but the test of your bravery. Because we have been searching for courageous men like you for a long time. Starting today, you are our friend and partner. But please refrain from calling me a dog please. I won't refer to you as a dog as long as we remain friends. But the day our friendship ends, I will transform into a lion and make your life far worse than that of a dog. Okay. Okay. This here is my partner Ronnie, and listen. Yes, sir? Bring Kanwarlal and change his appearance into that of a handsome man. Dress him in a suit and boots, and then present him before me. Hi. Welcome, Mr. Mahesh Kumar. Welcome. Fantastic! - Even the police won't recognize you. Imagine that Kanwarlal ceases to exist from today, and Mahesh Kumar is born in his place. Mahesh Kumar...Mahesh Kumar is present before you, but what will you present before him? Rita. Kanwarlal, this is Rita. Whenever a man becomes upset with us in business, Rita responds with a comforting smile, and that stubborn man instantly softens. Rita, Mahesh Kumar is your special guest today. Don't skimp on hospitality, or Topiwala will be humiliated. ♫ Upon seeing you, I feel my youth will pass. That my youth will pass now. This youth will pass now. Upon seeing you, I feel my youth will pass. We have been able to meet with great difficulty. The heartfelt conversations remained unfinished. My nights were very lonely. My nights were very lonely. My life was very difficult. Now my life will pass. Upon seeing you, I feel my youth will pass now. This cold water is ablaze. Listen, tell me a story. This cold water is ablaze. Listen, give me some story. A beautiful souvenir of youthful love, which left its memory behind. This pleasant night will pass. Upon seeing you, I feel my youth will pass. Why are you standing there? Come here. Let my arms embrace you. Drown in my eyes. Drown in my eyes. Otherwise, I will remain thirsty. This pleasant moment will pass. Upon seeing you, I feel my youth will pass. That my youth will pass now. This youth will pass now. Upon seeing you. ♫ Post. My dear, has Sushil's letter arrived? Yes, Ma. However, he has deceived us once again. He didn't write his address. Now, which address shall I send the reply to? My dear, a police officer never discloses his address to anyone when he goes to fulfill his duty. Not even his wife? No. Not even his wife. A police officer marries twice in his life. Two marriages? - Yes, two. One with his wife and other with his duty. He belongs to his wife when he returns home. Kanwar, the government is turning into a bigger enemy with each passing day. No matter what my partners and I do in the underworld, the government somehow gets wind of it. It appears that some officer has also compiled a file against us. I've heard that the Prime Minister himself is going to investigate our case. If the Prime Minister gets wind of this, we're in serious trouble. So, it's crucial for us to obtain that file before it reaches his desk. I see. Where is that file? - All the details are in this document. That file is the certificate of our very survival. Once we acquire it, no one will be able to harm us. If not, just imagine. You, my partners, and I will all be hanged, one after the other. If I manage to obtain that file, what reward will I receive? Rs. 2 lakh. The value placed on you and the lives of your partners is merely Rs. 2 lakh? Not even a lame horse in a race can be acquired for Rs. 2 lakh. Well, what is your demand? Rs. 5 lakh. Rs. 2 lakh in advance. Cash. Okay. I agree. Come. Here. Check it. It's genuine, not counterfeit. Topiwala, you may use your glasses to verify the authenticity, but I can assure you that even with my eyes closed, I can distinguish between what in front of me is real and what's fake. Well, how many men do you want along with you? No one. - No one? Yes. A lion doesn't hunt in the company of sheep. Within four days, either the file or Kanwarlal's lifeless body will be presented to you. All the best. Who is it, Bro? Hello? Fire brigade? The Central Research Building has caught fire. Hurry up! Hello? Police Station? You brought it, Kanwar? Wow! Terrific! Excellent! Beautiful! Kanwarlal, you are great! I'm at a loss for words to express my praise for you. Shall I write a poem in your honour? I don't know what to say, what to do. Kanwarlal, you've saved us from certain death. He has outshined you all. You accomplished the task alone that none of them could achieve together. You are great! You are great! This file. - This. That's all fine. Now, where's my money? I’ll give you double the amount. One in the form of a bundle of notes and the other in the form of sensuous lips. My friend Azad has brought a beautiful girl from the brothel. I’ll gift her to you. Take it and enjoy. Hi, partners. - Hi, partner. I'm back again. It appears that there is a meeting taking place. Who is he? I haven't seen him before. I’ll tell you. He is my friend, my partner, Mr. Azad. Azad, he is the brave man who brought this file, and saved our lives. - Hello. Azad, I'm passing him your whore as a gift. Well okay. Have her. Ok Romeo, lift her veil and witness the enchantment. Go, buddy. ♫ I'm glad that I met you. I'm glad that I met you. All the memories have resurfaced. I'm glad that I met you. The memories have come alive. If not, my wish to meet you would have remained unfulfilled. If not, my wish to meet you would have remained unfulfilled. This heart would have remained empty. The wounds of the heart have healed. They have healed. They have healed. I'm glad that I met you. All the memories have resurfaced. I didn't leave in a palanquin, and no music played. I didn't leave in a palanquin, and no music played. I faced suffering that was written in my fate. Both the worlds collapsed. They collapsed. They collapsed. I'm glad that I met you. All the joyful memories have returned. I don't have any path or destination. Forgive me, but it will be impossible to meet again. Forgive me, but it will be impossible to meet again. We were meant to meet each other. We have met. We have met. I'm glad that I met you. All the memories have resurfaced. I really missed my loved ones surrounded by strangers. I really missed my loved ones surrounded by strangers. As I danced, cuts appeared on my feet, making even the touch of flowers painful. The pain. The pain. I'm glad that I met you. The memories have come alive. ♫ Shobha my sister, what have you done? I will definitely avenge your sacrifice. I will seek revenge for every drop of your blood. Kulwant? Yes, Kulwant speaking. It's "Operation-N" speaking. The child is dead. Make preparations to perform the last rites. Code is "Apple". "Apple". Apple? Yes, you will get the apples. Okay? - Okay. Buy red juicy apples! Buy Kabul apples. How much for these apples? Rs. 30 per dozen. How much will you buy?. Apple vendor, come here. - Coming, sir. Place it here. - Here, sir. The apples seem good. How much? Sir, purchase the entire basket, and I'll charge Rs 50 for it. Rs 50? - Yes. Does this basket contain what I had asked for? Everything is inside it. - Okay. Sir, pay me. - Here take Rs 50. Thank you, sir. Where should I store these apples? You can also find apples at the hotel. So why did you buy them? This is not for me, darling. I've brought them for you. For me? - Yes. You're sweet like an apple, so, I thought of gifting apples to you. If you have so much love for me in your heart, then why don't you let me come close to you? Why do always avoid me? It's confidential. I’ll explain it to you another time. Waiter. Yes, sir? Bring it inside. - Shall we go? Shall I accompany you? - Not in private. Can't we at least sit and talk? - Actually I. Hi baby. No more chatting; let's focus on the task at hand. The guests have arrived. Come on. Come on! Hello. If you wanted to eat apples, you could have ordered some from the hotel. Why did you bring them from outside? Azad, I've always been fond of eating Kabuli apples since childhood. Here. Take one. Who is it? - Kanwarlal? Yes. Yes, it's me speaking. Tell me, Topiwala. - Come here. Sure. I’ll be over right away. Azad, Topiwala needs to see you right away. Asshole, what were you doing in my room? I had a suspicion, so I came to verify. If you doubt Kanwarlal, you're in for big trouble. Listen to me carefully. If you even pass by this room again, I’ll chop you to pieces. Now, get out. You will chop me to pieces? ♫ Oh, doll, tell me how will my darling daughter be? Oh, doll, tell me how will my darling daughter be? I think she will be exactly like you. Oh, doll, tell me how will my darling daughter be? I think she will be exactly like you. Oh, doll, tell me. I wait impatiently for you everyday. I spend the night counting the stars. I wait impatiently for you everyday. I spend the night counting the stars. I can't concentrate on anything. I think how she will be. Oh, doll, tell me how will my darling daughter be? I think she will be exactly like you. Oh, doll, tell me. There was a celebration in the entire city. The lamps were lit in the heart. The world will remember when she will come home. Our home will glow with radiance. Oh, doll, tell me. I've pleasant dreams in my eyes. Games, amusement, toys and rattles. She will not let us sleep. Tears will well up in my eyes while laughing. Oh, doll, tell me how will my darling daughter be? I think she will be exactly like you. Oh, doll, tell me. I think she will be exactly like you. She will be exactly like you. She will be exactly like you. ♫ Mom? Mom? Mom? Mom? Mom? What happened? Tell me. Hello? - Hello, Kulwant. Yes, go ahead Sister-in-law. Mom fell down the stairs. - What? Yes, she passed out. Get a doctor right away. Okay, I’ll be right there. Please come soon. Come, Doctor. Doctor, hurry up. Doctor, please check her quickly. What's wrong, Doctor? Will we have to take her to the hospital? No, Mr. Kulwant. It's too late. No! Please, don't say that! Doctor, please do your best, she will recover. Please make an attempt! Please, Doctor. Please! What attempt can I make, Sister? I'm sorry but your mother is no longer with us. No. You're lying, Doctor. My mother can't leave us. I wasn't feeling sleepy a short while ago. Mom had gently stroked me to sleep. Has she gone forever, after putting me to sleep? No, Doctor! This can't be happening! No! Mom, please don't impose such a severe punishment on me. You were asking me for your grandchild just now. You were dreaming about playing with your grandchild. Mother, let your dream come true, just this once. Don't leave us Ma. Don't leave us. Please stay strong Sister-in-Law. Don't cry. You should call him now and ask him to touch his mother's feet, just like he used to do every day before heading to work, for the last time. She is leaving this house forever. Please call him. Why are you silent? Why don't you answer me? I'm helpless. What kind of job demands carrying the burden of the country while refusing to lead a mother's funeral procession? What kind of duty is this that prevents a son from fulfilling his responsibilities towards his mother? If you can't call him then give me his contact information. I will call him. I beg you, call my husband just this one time, please. No, don't say that. I’ll try. I’ll go and tell my officers to call Sushil immediately. I will try my best, Sister-in-law. Keep patience. Radha, you stay here and take care of her. - Ok Sir? - Kulwant? What brings you here at this hour? I have some bad news. Sushil's mother... What happened? - She passed away. Oh, my God! - Sir, his wife is crying uncontrollably. She desperately wants to bring Sushil back home at any cost. We run our illegal business with utmost honesty. Escaping from Azad's clutches is not an easy task. Stay calm, dear. We will do our best to reach out to Sushil and inform him. Sir, I believe in the name of humanity, Sushil should be informed about his mother's passing immediately. Kulwant, you know that Sushil is involved in something highly significant. He is doing a tremendous favor for this department and our country. Sushil is accomplishing what no other officer has ever managed to achieve. Crime is hollowing out this country from within. Sushil is committed to purging the world of crime. Under these circumstances, if he comes to know that his dear mother has passed, perhaps he will leave this mission incomplete. Our entire plan will fail completely. All our efforts will be wasted. These criminals and crooks will continue to drain the life out of this country. Hello. Kulwant speaking. Operation End. Kulwant, Operation End speaking. Yes. - Mission accomplished. Sir, Sushil has indicated that he has caught a very important member of that gang. Very good! - And he has called me right away. Then hurry up. But Kulwant, come what may, Sushil should never come to know about his mother. But sir, if he. - That's my order! - Okay, sir. Kulwant, this is Azad. He is a crucial pawn in this gang. He is also involved in making and approving plans. Come on. Take him way. Sushil. - What happened? Don't waste time. Take him! Hurry up! - Come on. - Take him! Get off! - Hey you. Come on! Get in! Mr. Azad, you have lived a lavish life with dirty money. Now, you will experience what life behind bars is like too. Officer, don't be under that impression. You can put as many locks on this door as you wish. But the people who I work for have the key to every lock. You'll be left watching. And I’ll be out of here. Because I’m not used to living behind bars. You shut up! May her soul rest his peace. May her soul rest his peace. May her soul rest his peace. May her soul rest his peace. May her soul rest his peace. May her soul rest his peace. Kanwarlal, have you noticed something? Our fellow countrymen mourn the death of one of their own. Now, look at this old woman. I don't believe she would've been of any use. It's good that she died. She must have been a burden to her family. But look at them. They look so sad. As if it's their mother who died. Oh, come on. The procession is taking forever. Come on Aunty, we're running late. Honk the horn and let's get moving. Ma, this son of yours is so unfortunate. He couldn't even offer you a drop of water. He couldn't perform the final rites either. You gave me birth. You gave me life. And I couldn't give you anything, Ma. Nothing at all. Please, grant me one final blessing. That I succeed in the task I've undertaken. Where is Ronnie? Where on earth is Azad? Ronnie is making arrangements for the guests. Azad has been arrested. I mean he must have been nailed by some girl. Of course. He is often shackled by beautiful girls. Good evening. 'What are these individuals doing in this gathering of criminals?" Welcome, sir. Welcome. Welcome, sir. - Thank you. Welcome. - Thank you. - Come. Sir, this is Kanwarlal. In just one night, he acquired the file from the CBI office containing evidence against us. Mr. Kanwarlal, very good. We are proud of your bravery. This gentleman is a very dear friend of mine. He safeguards my business and he serves as the captain of our ship. These are the influential individuals who keep us in operation. I feel fortunate to have met individuals like you. It's as if I have met with a divine presence. Topiwala? - Yes, sir. There is no life in the party. Sir, no party hosted by Topiwala is ever dull. You can immerse yourself in liquor and let beauty captivate you. ♫ I extend my greetings to the guests. I extend my greetings to the guests. I am somewhat notorious. Kanwarlal, that's my name. Kanwarlal. Kanwarlal, that’s my name. You're in and out all the time. You're in and out all the time.

Everyone's bowled over by you. Everyone's knows who am I. Everyone's still oblivious. I salute the strangers. The strangers. Kanwarlal, that's my name. The stories that people hear in lanes are all tales about me. But everyone in this gathering on this night is crazy for me. The stories that people hear in lanes are all tales about me. But everyone in this gathering on this night is crazy for me. I salute my admirers. My admirers. Kanwarlal, that's my name. There is no admirer who hasn’t lost his heart to me.

Kanwarlal, that's my name. Kanwarlal. Kanwarlal, that's my name. ♫ How's it going, lnspector Sushil Kumar? You thought Azad is done for. He's never going to return. Right? Officer, our reach goes beyond the long arms of the law. Come on. Hand the camera and negatives over to me. Come on, get up. Be a sweet boy now. Who is it? Sister-in-law, it's me, Kulwant. Come in. - Hello, Sister-in-law. - Hello, Sister-in-law. Come in. Have a seat. How are you now? I’m just about okay. Did the doctor come this morning? Yes. Brother, any news on him? We'll find him, Sister-in-law. For sure. Look... look, I've told you so many times, don't think negatively. You should think positively in your condition. You shouldn't overthink too much. 'You should be happy' How can I be happy? I had Maa as my companion, but she is no longer with us. My husband is missing. And you're asking me to be happy. No one tells me where my husband is. Where he's located. In what state or condition he's in. Don't look at me with hatred in those eyes, Officer. I returned from prison. You're surprised by this? You want to know how I got out of prison? The officer on whose orders you got me put behind bars. That very officer, very respectfully, unlocked the prison, apologized to me, and set me free. I didn't escape from prison. Now, tell me. Where is the camera and the negatives? Tell me. Where are they? No. I won't tell you. Never. Inspector, this is not the police's torture chamber where you can't even make a criminal open his mouth properly. This place is a thousand times more brutal than that. This is Topiwala's torture chamber. Even the dead would scream in agony due to the torture inflicted here. You may think the dead are screaming due to your torture in this place. Their souls must be lifeless. But I’m the son of the mother who once said, "Your body might perish, but never let your soul die." No amount of your torture can bring Inspector Sushil Kumar to his knees Topiwala. My torture will break your knees first. Then I’ll see how you don't tell me everything. Go ahead. Test me. Pull out his nails. This is your last chance. Give it to me straight. Where are the camera and negatives? I’ll never tell you. I wont tell you. Now, what do you have to say? - Speak up. Speak up. This guy is a real tough one to crack. This motherfucker is a true patriot. As they say, "Gladly sacrifice our lives, but never the country's honor." He's one of those. That's why don't waste time on him. Kill him. No, partner. No. Give me some time. I have a weapon that will very easily make him open his mouth. Here you go. I want a bill for this. Taxi. Where would you like to go? Take me to Rickshawpur. - Very well. I’ll take you to your destination very soon. Sushil! Sushil! Sushil. Sushil. What happened? No. I can't believe what I'm seeing. No, Sushil. You were in London, right? I got your letter yesterday. If you're here, then who wrote me those letters? Tell me, Sushil. Tell me. These heartless people have brought you to such a terrible state. Who are these guys? I’ll tell you, Mrs. Sushil Kumar. Your husband was pretending. He fooled the world by pretending to go to London. But in reality, he didn't go. He was here the whole time. He joined our group after escaping from prison. And he began divulging our confidential information to the authorities. But you heartless beings, you're not human. You're like beasts. You're demons. How can you treat another human being in such a way? You've beaten him to an inch of his life. We've just started. We are going to chop him into little pieces. No. No! You can't touch my husband. Now, you're talking. Look, this is your husband. Your life partner. Your deity. Your existence depends on his survival. If he perishes, you'll become a widow. Your deity possesses a collection of our photographs and recordings. Pray to him that he returns the photos and tape as offering. We'll return him to you. In that case, you can head home. Sushil, don't bear this cruelty. Tell them. Where have you hidden those things? Tell them, Sushil. Sunita. Speak up, lnspector. - No. Your wife is begging you to save her married life. Come on, speak up. lnspector, have mercy on her. Talk. Sushil, tell them. - Come on, talk. - Talk. - Sushil, speak up. Tell them, Sushil. Sushil, tell them. Tell them for God's sake. In this neighborhood of devils, don't ask me to swear to God Sunita. You lament about the destruction of your marital life, but these individuals have devastated our nation. These individuals are planting the seeds of crime and sin, allowing lawlessness and deceit to flourish on our sacred land. And I possess all the evidence of their criminal activities. These individuals are like a malignant cancer, that corrodes our nation, its land, and our society. They are the cancer. And I have the treatment to that cancer. It doesn't matter even if Sushil Kumar dies. At the very least, the disadvantaged and the citizens of this nation will remain alive. If Sushil prioritizes his own life, this country will suffer. Tell me, Sunita. Do you choose your husband's life... - Sushil. or the well-being of this nation? Do you desire your husband's survival... or the survival of the country? Tell me, Sunita. Tell me. Tell me. A woman with a husband like you will never experience widowhood. Individuals like you are destined to be immortal. And the people who are born immortal never die. The wives of those who are eternal never become widows. Sushil, I consider myself fortunate to be the wife of such an exceptional man. Sushil, don't ever tell them. Never surrender those pieces of evidence. These people should be punished for what they've done. Well done, Sunita. Well done. Your words have relieved me from the pain of my wounds. I'm ready to be burnt willingly if they throw me into a fire now. I will endure it silently without making a sound. Listen, brave officer, there are various methods we can employ to set you aflame. We can use flowers to scorch those who remain unaffected by fire. Just like the little flower bud your wife is carrying. A single strike from us will reduce that bud to ashes before it even blossoms. You'll lose your heir forever. Your life will be plunged into darkness. I’m only asking for that tape and photo from you, for the sake of your unborn child who would you be your heir. Never! I’ll sacrifice my child for my husband, but I won't allow my husband to submit to monsters like you. No, Sushil. Don't ever hand them the evidence. Never! Azad. - I’ll deal with him. No! Sunita! Ask your dear husband where he has hidden all the evidence. Ask him! - I won't! You won't ask? Ask your beloved where he has kept the evidence. I'm not going to ask him! I'll never ask him! Ask him. - No! - Sunita. So, you won't ask him huh? - No! No! Ask him! - No! Sunita! No. No. No. No. No. No. Look, I’m telling you for the last time. Ask your husband! - I'm never going to ask him! Officer, I’m asking you for the last time. Otherwise, I assure you the child your wife is carrying, will have its blood flowing all over here. No. You bastard! Oh, come on. lnspector. - Sunita! - This is your last chance. - You bastard! No! - Get up. Sunita. No! No! No! Sunita! No! Sunita! No! Sunita! No! No! No! Sushil. Sushil. Sushil. - Forgive me, Sunita. Forgive me. No, Sushil. No. Don't cry, Sushil. Or else, people might say that Sunita's husband lacked courage. He couldn't bear his wife's pain. And he couldn't hold back his tears while sacrificing his child for the country. Sushil, brave men don't shed tears. No, Sushil. A married woman adorns herself with the blessings of her husband. I’m fortunate that I've graced myself with the blood you have given this country. That binds me as your wife forever. Sushil, the doors to heaven have opened for me. Our child is standing there. She's waiting for me there. She's calling me with her arms spread, Sushil. I’ll go to her and tell her that her father was a great man. Sushil, but don't ever forgive these people. Sushil, but don't ever forgive them. They must be punished for their crimes. They must be punished. No Sunita! Sushil, I... Sunita! In my eyes, melodies of dreams brightly gleam. All these plays, toys, and amusements. These things keep us awake. My emotions have shifted abruptly from laughter to tears. Oh, my love. Oh, my dearest, how will my darling be? 'What are you thinking, Rita? "If you rescue Sushil today, you'll be able to breathe new life not only into Sushil, but also into your country." Wake up, Sushil. Escape while you can. If they succeed in eliminating you, the law won't be able to catch them. You gotta go. Sir, releasing Azad from prison was a grave mistake. Your actions have condemned my friend to death. Can you fathom the consequences when they realize Sushil is their enemy and a cop? Have you thought about it? I’m very sorry, Kulwant. Kulwant, I'm well aware that I've committed a grave offense. But I was left with no choice. I have to answer to the higher authorities. The people whom the people elect as leaders. They leveraged the authority of their positions to compel me into releasing Azad. You were coerced by the influence of their position... and you found yourself powerless. Because you realized that your position was at risk. Your job. Your position. Your life. You realized that the safety of your family was at stake. And you released Azad. Do you recall that day when you called me to your office for the first time? You had stood there and told me that Sushil Kumar, your job demands sacrifices from you. You made me realize the loyalty to this land and country. You sent me into a dangerous world, where every breath is accompanied by the fear of death, with the purpose of eliminating the criminals who are corroding this nation. Do you remember that day? I went to honorably fulfill my duty. But you're at a much higher position than me. You've tarnished the reputation of your position. You stained your uniform with the blood and sacrifices of others! Your betrayal tarnished the medals on your uniform. You did this! Topiwala, Azad and his accomplice degraded my respectable sister into a prostitute. My sister committed suicide right before my eyes. And I kept silent. I remained silent due to my commitment to my duty. I kept weeping from within, but outwardly, I maintained a smile. I watched as the funeral procession of my mother passed by. Unfamiliar faces were shouldering it. And I watched that from a distance. Because I had the burden of my duty on my shoulders. That's why I couldn't shoulder and carry my mother's body. I’m not finished yet! My wife was humiliated right before my eyes. She was murdered! My unborn child was brutally killed within my wife's womb through repeated blows. My entire family is destroyed. My entire world shattered to pieces. No one survived. No one. You're responsible for this. You! You're responsible for the deaths of my mother, sister, wife, and child. You've murdered them. You're the killer. You have their blood on your hands! If you still uphold respect, truth and loyalty, then I'm ready to endure all the sacrifices I've made. I’ll forget all my pain. Here. These are proofs of the atrocities committed by those individuals. Here. Now take those devils into custody. Please arrest them, sir. Sir, please arrest them. Please. Please arrest them. Hello. - This is Minister Dayal. Listen, CBl Officer Sangram Singh? - Yes, sir. Arrest Inspector Sushil Kumar immediately. What? - This is my personal order. Sir! Sir, what have you done! What have you done, sir! Sushil, you're right. I've failed in my duty. I've betrayed my honor. I have no right to be in this position. Forgive...Forgive me. I just got the orders on the phone to arrest you. No, I lack the courage to arrest a patriot like you and hand you over to traitors. I. - Sir! Sushil! Sushil!, Stop Shushil! I said... - Move! Who is it? Who is it? You. Why are you here? I have come to eliminate injustice from this country, by removing you from this world. You'll be hanged if you kill me. How many times can I be hanged? Just once, right? I'm fine with it, even if I'm hanged for eliminating you monsters. This is a cheap bargain. Hello. - Hello. Police Station? Come on, Hurry up! Move! Put the car in reverse! Go faster! I thought he was dead. Pull back. Faster! No! No! No! No! No! 'The law is powerless.' 'Now, who will respond to its cries for justice? 'It's YOUR turn to decide now.' 'It's YOUR turn to decide now.' 'It's YOUR turn to decide now.'
