Hello, sweetheart. It's freezing out here. Come with me, eh? Fancy a bit of fun, do you, darling? Aah! He could smell I've been with you. You know how morbidly jealous Roger gets. You won't change your mind and come with me? I hoped I might persuade you to, Helen, to the very last. We agreed to give it two months. Letters from me and a phone call from you on Tuesdays, but not before 8:00. Then Roger's at his gun club. You know I'll come. Just give me more time. All I know is that I'm going to be really lonely, all alone in cold London. Don't exaggerate. You'll get used to it. Ohh. [Waltz from the nutcracker plays] Tchaikovsky. I'll be bloody glad to see the back of that bloke Dean when he moves out next month. Blasted gramophone. Be a relief to everyone, I'm sure. With the exception of kotowsky. He'll be losing his boozing pal when Dean goes. He can take his empty wine bottles with him. We might find room in the bins for something else. Stick the kettle on. I'm dying for a drink myself. [Music stops] Ahh. A little bird told me you've already let the empty room. A little Chinese bird, was it? I was a bit put out that you told miss chan before informing me. I am your oldest tenant, after all, and I can rightly say that I've never caused you the slightest trouble. You know me-- always believe in speaking frankly if there's anything on my mind, and... I was a little hurt. I didn't know how you'd take it. The fellow moving into number 2, he's got the same name as you. You have to laugh. What a coincidence. You mean his name's Arthur Johnson? No, no. It's not as bad as that, but he's called Anthony Johnson. You'll have to be careful, you know, getting your post mixed up. Don't want him reading your love letters, do you? I've nothing to hide. My life's an open book. Bloody fine basin, this. Cost me 50 quid to get it fitted. Your lot did it. It was a reject. There was a flaw in the soap dish. For 40 quid a week, what do you expect? It's no concern of mine. I know it's what you paid for your whole flat, but thank your lucky stars you got hold of it before I knew the ropes. I hope he's given you a good bank reference. No worries there, mate. He paid two months in advance. Cash beats a bank reference any day. My namesake won't be home much anyway, will he? He moves in at the weekend. What's so interesting out there? Nothing. I was just thinking our new tenant doesn't have a particularly good view. [Door swings shut] [Children shouting] After all I've done for you, Arthur. 100 pounds she asked for you from her own sister, and then she was off like greased lightning. [Key turns in lock] I've told you three times to put the empties out! I don't want to be using up all my breath asking where they are! You can save breath, vesta, by telling me where you'll be! Out! I told you--out! [Glass breaks] Be gone, then! Go on out! [Woman laughs] Good morning. Good morning, Barry. A little late, aren't we? Do you know what the time is? About half 9:00, I reckon. You reckon. Old Granger's coming across the yard. Take that filthy muck out of your mouth. Every day the same-- piles of the stuff, as if the world didn't have a paper shortage. I tidy up the circulars. No one seems to care about them, but it's not my place to throw them away. Anthony Johnson. I moved in at the weekend. You're the fellow who's taken the little back room. Everyone keeps himself to himself here, and you won't want to use the phone after 11:00, will you? Where is the phone? On the first-floor landing. My flat's on the top floor. I've a whole flat to myself, not just a room. Ah, you must be the other Johnson. I've lived here for 20 years. You are the other one. Mr. Johnson, I presume. The other Johnson. You should put that on your nameplate. My name's Brian, Brian kotowsky. And--and--and this is Jonathan Dean. He's... He's the best pal a fellow could have. Lived here long? Forever and a day, but I'm soon to depart. And leaving me alone with boadicea. Without your influence, she'll do me in. The little woman will tear me up into little pieces. As in all the best marriages, it's no bed of roses. It's a battlefield. Look at Tolstoy. Look at Lawrence. Appearances, Arthur. [Helen] I'm obviously not very good at telling lies. I know Roger senses there is something between US. He was always jealous without reason without showing it too much, but now he phones me in the office two or three times a day sometimes. And last week he opened two letters addressed to me. One was from my mother, the other from a mail-order firm. You don't know my mad passion for buying anything when all one has to do is tick a box. I hope the coast's clear. He's not listening on another extension, is he? Otherwise I can see him coming here tomorrow and shooting me. Of course I'm teasing you, darling. I got your letter, but I wasn't expecting a detailed description of Roger's woes. Well, term starts in a week. I've enrolled for a few lectures, but I'll be doing most of my dissertation work from home so-- do I go out in the evening? Where should I go and, darling, with whom? Hello. Hello. Are you going out for the evening or just to post a letter? To post a letter. Allow me to take it. I've got to post one myself. I hope you've given your full address to avoid any embarrassing mistakes. Don't let's make problems where none exist. It's my duty to bring to your attention the need to make it quite clear your letters be addressed to room 2. Having said that, you can't blame me for any mix-ups. It sounds like too much hassle. Shall I take yours, too? Dear Mr. Johnson, in reply to your letter of the 22nd, inst-- inquiring about part-time employment in the youth-welfare service of the London borough of kenbourne... "Dear Mr. Johnson, my most sincere--" "Dear Mr. Johnson, "please accept my heartfelt apologies for having opened your letter in error." Considering the gravity of this intrusion into your private affairs, I think it only proper to give you a full explanation of the circumstances. I myself was expecting a letter from the council in reply to one of my own requesting action to be taken concerning the disgraceful situation resulting from the refuse collectors' strike. I write this letter in the hope you will be kind enough to overlook that which was, in fact, a genuine mistake. I am, yours sincerely, Arthur Johnson. I tell you, sorry. You give theater ticket to other nice girl. I stay at home and wash hair... Alone. Don't be silly. [Laughs] I don't love you 'cause I wash hair? I tell you I love you. I love many, many people. [Door closes] But only one. I have to work. A penny for the guy, mister. Do you even know who guy Fawkes was and why they burn his effigy? Tell me. A 17th-century traitor. He blowed up parliament. You know. Everyone knows! Everyone knows! Where's the bonfire going to be, Radclyffe park? The park people won't let US. We could have it in our back yard. But will the coppers break it up? What about over there? Yeah. Got lots of room. Ohh. Mr. Johnson? Aah! [Whispering] There's some timber and junk in our cellar we could burn. I spoke with the landlord. That's good. My brother's got a wheelbarrow. What about a hat for the guy? We can have rockets and Roman candles! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Use one of my husband's old suits. Then he'll have to buy new one. Mind your hard left. Hey. You want a hand? Nah. Look at this. It's filthy. Tscha ochisma. Why do you want to waste your money on a hole like that? Caspian would let you keep your room. I'm sure. He's already let it to some spade. O tempora. O mores. Oh, the times. Oh, the manners. It's big enough for his record player, isn't it? The previous tenant left it. We had a case like this round here. That would be something for your research, eh? The kenbourne killer. 23 years ago, he strangled his first victim here-- a girl called Maureen cowan. In the cemetery? No. In front of the garages. She was on the game. That was her patch. I was only a nipper at the time, but I remember it well enough. Nipper? Christ, you're kidding. You were 14 if you were a day. They never caught the bastard. And two years later, he struck again, eh? The kenbourne killer. This time it was, uh, a student nurse called... Bridget. Bridget something. I can't remember the name. Irish girl. He never took a penny. Think a girl like that would be a psychopath? I study psychopaths. I'm not the police. [Helen] I ask myself if it wouldn't be better for US to forget each other. It would still be possible, Tony. Even I, whom you regard as excessively romantic, even I know that people don't go on loving each other hopelessly forever. The story of troilus and cressida may be beautiful, but it isn't real. Rubbish. Stupid, illogical... Rubbish. No! That's mine! No, mine! Cowardy. [Boys] * cowardy, cowardy custard * * Johnson is a bastard where is your dad? Dead. * auntie's baby, auntie's baby * where's your dad, Arthur Johnson? I got your letter. No, Helen, I'm not angry. I'm tired, sick and tired. You're not a little girl anymore. Shoot. Helen, we set ourselves a deadline, remember? Psst! No, no. I can't. Some other time. No, no, Helen. Nothing. I'm a bore. I was talking to someone else. I should know it by now. Vesta's told me often enough. Hello? Yeah. No. No. Definitely not. Do you think I want to sit in a hotel room all week over Christmas to see you for a day at most? If you manage to escape your keeper, that is. And the same at easter, maybe. No, Helen, no. I won't play lap dog. [Dial tone] Hello? Yeah. That was the last of my change. Don't cry, please. Don't cry. Don't cry. I do love you, Helen. You know I do. No, I don't know. Just make up your mind. The next letter is going to be bloody important. Helen... It's our last chance. You don't need to be afraid of Roger. I'll be here with you. He'll divorce you, all right, when he sees that resistance is futile. You can't keep me waiting forever. There are other women in the world, you know. I hear how important your husband is to you, and now you're afraid he'll find an unaccounted call on his phone bill? It's like a bloody French farce. Listen, I ask myself whether if it's not-- [dial tone] Too late, anyway. Go, go... Go. Busy? Well, not a bad idea. But perhaps we'll try it the other way this time. O.k.? O.k. See you soon. Well, something's going on, isn't it? Now I get it. You're so fond of this quaint little place with all its precious antiques and that fabulous view to an old world cellar door. You simply can't tear yourself away, man, not for a single evening. And that lamp shade, it looks just like a Portuguese man-of-war. I knew it was a jellyfish, but I didn't know what kind. Now, the fact is, I'm expecting a phone call. That's why I couldn't get away. I'll tell you the whole story some day... But at the moment, i'd... Rather hear all about you. [Knock on door] Awfully sorry to disturb you. I'm Winston mervin. Just moved in upstairs. Wonder whether you could do me a little favor and... Lend me a little salt. Well, I'll be. So that was your surprise. I can't believe it. Coincidences? Well, not entirely. You see, the salt was just an excuse. I saw you outside the front door. Yeah, but you living in this area in this house. We know each other from Kingston-- Jamaica, not on thames. Haven't seen each other for 12 years. Do you want to set the place alight? [Bang] What pissed you off this morning? How dare you use such language to me? When I was your age... Don't stand there. Put the kettle on and make tea. Arthur... The tea's brewing. You seen that pile of timber they want to burn for a bonfire? Over on the waste ground? And who are they? Haven't got a clue. I suppose it's local kids. No, I haven't seen it. I prefer it in the cup, if you don't mind. I've never seen such a bleeding heap of timber, not for a bonfire anyway. Be the biggest burn-up in the whole area. The fireworks industry will do a roaring trade. Yeah. And the fire brigade and all. It's no good looking out the window. You won't see nothing from here. It's farther over in brasenose street. You know, by the demolition site. Other side of the fence. Let's hope there won't be a catastrophe. Waah! Can you really trust him to look after the baby alone? [Auntie Gracie] It'll do Arthur a world of good to be put into a position of trust like that. [Baby gurgling] Won't it, Arthur? Waah! Waah! I'm proud of you, Arthur. No! Don't go! My protectress! My guardian angel. Here. Take this. But don't let them off. Let's light the pile first, all right? Be careful, all right? Remember, remember the 5th of November. Gunpowder, treason, and plot. I see no reason why gunpowder treason should ever be forgot. Remember, remember the 5th of November. Gunpowder, treason, and plot. I got it. I see no reason why gunpowder treason should ever be forgot. Remember, remember the 5th of November. Gunpowder, treason, and plot. I see no reason why gunpowder treason should ever be forgot. Remember, remember the 5th of November. Gunpowder, treason, and plot. I see no reason why gunpowder treason should ever be forgot. Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Hooray! Yay! Yay! No. No. No. [Anthony] The next letter will be our last chance. [Auntie Gracie] Other's people's correspondence is sacrosanct, Arthur. Opening other people's letters is the action of a thief. Look at the stars, my star. Would I were the heavens that I might look at you with many eyes. You're not short of surprises, Winston. I suppose you'll tell me next you're a professor of ancient Greek. I considered it once, but there's more money in accountancy than in Aristotle. I'm a financial advisor. You're a mystery to me. Tony, I've chosen you-- absolutely and finally. I shall leave Roger. Tony, forgive me. I have played fast and loose with you like a right gypsy. We could be together by Saturday. Say we will be, and I will come, even if I have to run from Roger. Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute. They're all for you, I'm afraid. Thanks. Trinity road, please. Trinity road? Where's that, guv'nor? I've just come from there. I'm on my way to bed now. You can't refuse a fare. I shall note your number. I shall report you to the authorities. Screw you and your authorities. Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Mr. Johnson? Yes. Detective inspector glass. I'd like a few words with you. May I come in? We're investigating a murder, Mr. Johnson. Could you tell me where and how you spent yesterday evening? What do you mean, where and how? Oh, quite simply, Mr. Johnson, I'd just like to know where you were. I was here-- here in my flat. I came home at half past 6:00 and stayed here. Were you alone? Yes. According to my information, you spent the evening with Winston mervin, Brian kotowsky, and a person by the name of Potter. And a person by the name of-- oh, I see. You're mistaking me for Anthony Johnson, the other one. He lives in room 2 on the ground floor. I'm sorry about that. I said I was here all evening. An understandable confusion. Then you won't be able to tell US the whereabouts of Brian kotowsky. I hardly know him. I keep myself to myself. But tell me, the murder you mentioned... Are you connecting Mr. Kotowsky with it in any way? Oh, inevitably, Mr. Johnson. The murdered woman was his wife. When did they let you off the hook? Off the hook? Who? The police. We didn't see you down at the station. Vesta was murdered last night, Tony. Strangled. And Brian's disappeared. If Brian kotowsky did kill her, he can't have been at Dean's place at 11:15. He left you at 10 to 11:00 to catch her at closing time without knowing which way she'd come or whether she'd come at all. Isn't it unlikely that a husband should hang around in a pitch-black mews on a cold night simply to fight with his own wife? And not just that-- to murder her as well. We don't really know what conclusions they've reached. The police always think the motive's jealousy and that wives are murdered by their husbands. You say you come 8:30. You oversleep? Why not buy alarm clock? You wouldn't oversleep if I sleep with you. Maybe yes. Maybe no. Of course I love you. You come quickly, before li-li get the sack. Do you fancy a ride? Yeah. Jump in. "What have I done? No word from you." "So whatever happens now, "I have to see you. I have to come. I love you. Helen." No. "Forgive me. "I'm sorry not to have written before, as I promised." "I knew you would be angry "if I said I couldn't make up my mind. "Well, I have made up my mind now. "I've decided to stay with Roger. "I'm his wife. My place is by his side." What do you think of it? Very nice, indeed, if you happen to have the odd 100 thousand to spare. But it's no place for a bachelor, is it? You will have to get married, Winston. Settle down, have kids, and with a little bit of luck, you'll be able to plant another 10 like those. Do I detect a note of, uh, disapproval? Not at all. I think I'll buy it. Just a bit of color. Just a second. Look at this. "Vesta's husband found drowned. "The body of a man washed up "on the banks of the river Don in aberdeen, Scotland, "was today identified as that of Mr. Brian kotowsky, 40, an antique dealer." I wish I hadn't looked at the paper until tomorrow. Look, um, I have an appointment. I--i must be off. I must tell the estate agents that I've found the house I'm looking for, otherwise they'll keep sending me their stuff. Perhaps this will buck you up a bit. I hope so. "I know I owe you a decision. "Well, I have made up my mind now. "I must tell you frankly. "I've decided to stay with Roger. "I am his wife. My place is by his side. "I never really loved you. It was just infatuation. My place is by his side." My god, it's something out of woman's own. "Don't phone me. "Don't attempt to contact me ever again. "Roger will be very angry if you do. This is the end irrevocably." Contact. Infatuation. Trivial journalese, that's all it is. "I'm his wife, and my place is by his side." What century are you living in, Helen, hmm? I always knew Roger was a dictator, but letting him dictate a letter like this... Yes. He's been identified as Brian kotowsky, the husband of vesta kotowsky, who was strangled on guy Fawkes' night in kenbourne vale. Mr. Kotowsky, who has relatives in aberdeen, has been missing since the day after his wife's death. David Willis, first city news, kenbourne. You give that god damn guy the boot, Helen. Tell him straight who you belong to. Write that he shouldn't attempt contact with you, or I'll tear his face off. Make it clear that it's all over. Do you understand? You can phone from here, Tony, but I'd be grateful if you'd stay with Leroy when you've made your call. Sure. Very appropriate weather. For the time of year. Hallo? Ja, guten tag. Ich mochte gerne Helen schweizer sprechen. Um, abteilung schiffahrt. Es ist ein privates gesprach. Johnson. Anton Johnson. Danke. Was? Aber sie muss da sein. Vierzehn tage urlaub? November? Das ist doch unmoglich. Horen sie mal, ich glaube ihnen kein wort! Sie hat ihnen aufgetragen, mir das zu sagen, nicht wahr? [Dial tone] Arthur, I am happy. Things are looking up at last. Two bits of good news. The coppers say I can relet kotowsky's flat, which I will next week. Oh, they're, uh, cremating him on Monday. Locally? Yeah. At the cemetery. I don't expect there'll be a big turnout. My old woman says I should put in an appearance, but there are limits. It's no concern of mine. But then I, um, I haven't finished yet. Your, uh, rent's going to go up, mate. All perfectly legal and aboveboard. Oh, don't pull a face. Another 5 quid a week's not going to hurt you. What did I do with that packet of crisps? No doubt you're entitled to, but I'll ask my solicitor to look at it. Monday. Hell of a day for a funeral. You won't find it easy letting those rooms after a murder and suicide. People don't like that sort of thing. I hate funerals, especially when I'm happy, and, Arthur, today I am happy. "For as much as it hath pleased almighty god "of his great mercy "to take unto himself the soul of our dear brother, "here departed, "we therefore commit his body "to be consumed by fire. "Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust. "In sure and certain hope, "the resurrection to eternal life through our lord Jesus Christ. Amen." She was like a mother to you, wasn't she? You'll be needing a place of your own, now, Arthur. Bachelor's digs. How does the top floor of 142 grab you? Oh! No! Aah! Dear Mrs. Liccini, I know that Mrs. Schweizer will be spending time in November with you, and I wonder if you would be kind enough to give her the enclosed. I have mislaid her present address, otherwise, I wouldn't trouble you. Yours sincerely, a. Johnson. I've got to post a letter myself. Could I repay your kindness of a few weeks ago and take yours? Thank you. Hey, would you believe it? Mervin's given a month's notice. The whole bloody first floor will be empty. The rats, one could say, are deserting the sinking ship. But not you, mate. Tenants of unfurnished flats don't go till they're carried out feet first. You'll end your days here, won't you, Arthur? Got the ring? O.K. Kenbourne registry office, please. A-A-Allow me to offer you my congratulations, Mr. Mervin, and good luck. Happiness for the future. Thank you very much. Lovely day for a wedding. Bit chilly, perhaps. There. That means you'll be the next to marry. No. No. That only applies to bridesmaids. Best men, too. It's an old west Indian custom. It was perfect. Yes. We'll remember that. I hope so. Why were you so nervous? Because you were thinking of your bride, yes? Shouldn't we ask old Johnson to join US? Watch the traffic, Leroy. I know he's a pain, but-- he wished me good luck this morning. Mr. Johnson, can you spare a few minutes to celebrate with US? Oh, no. At the castle. Thank you. It's good of you to ask. Please. It's good of you to ask. Wonderful. Ladies and gentlemen, refreshments. Claret is the liquor for boys, port for men, but he who aspires to be a hero must drink Brandy. In the words of Dr. Johnson-- no, not our Tony. "To marry is to domesticate the recording angel. "Once you're married, there's nothing left-- "not even suicide... But to be good." Yeah. You like me, don't you, darling? Maybe. Huh? Ooh. You're not so fastidious, are you? Perhaps--perhaps you'd care to change places with me. No. You sit down. No, no, no. There. There. That's more cozy, isn't it? [Laughing] [Cat meows] [Meow] Ohh! [Baby cries] What's your problem, eh? Hey? What's your fucking problem? Aah! You should be locked up, mate. Locked up forever. [Barking] Looks like nothing up here. [Grrr] [Barking] A man was attacked in this car park in kenbourne vale, near the Taj Mahal cinema. From the circumstances of the attack, police believe that his assailant mistook him for a woman. They're working on the theory that the attacker could be the same man who, for a quarter of a century, has been known as the kenbourne killer. A massive police hunt is underway, but it's so far proved unsuccessful. Police have issued an identikit picture of the attacker. The wanted man is described as being about 6'2", of slim build, and has dark brown eyes, probably aged in his 50s. Earlier, I spoke to the victim of this assault. Mr. Harrison, what happened? I reckon this guy thought I was a girl, what with the long hair and being skinny and stuff. Would you recognize the man again? Yeah, sure. I landed him one right in the face. I mean, I reckon anyone could identify him now, not just me. Well, leading this investigation is detective inspector glass. What makes you think it is the same man-- the kenbourne killer? There are strong identifying features linking all three cases-- no robbery, no rape. No, I've no doubt. I must stress, this man is very dangerous. He should not be approached under any circumstances. You can be assured... We won't rest till we've got him and put him out of harm's way. It's only a matter of time... But if anyone has any suspicion as regards to his identity or can help with our inquiries in any way, then they should ring US day or night. Just remember... The next victim could be your wife, your mother, or your daughter. [Car engine] The number to ring for kenbourne police is... That's 071-226-0199. [Telephone rings] [Ring ring] [Ring ring] [Ring ring] [Ring ring] That you, Arthur? Yes. It's all right. It's only Mr. Caspian for me. O.k. Arthur, a bloke's coming around tomorrow at 5:00 to look at room 3. I can't. I can't let anyone in. I've got a terrible virus infection. I've got to stay in bed. Doctor's orders. Charming. After all I've done for you. Much obliged, I'm sure. All right, I'll make it earlier and let him in myself. I'm sorry. I'm really not well. [Dial tone] Tony? Tony! You won't leave me again? You're not going to tell me Roger's waiting, that you've only got a few minutes? I wouldn't know where to go. I've burned my boats. I can't make up my mind whether to sit opposite you or next to you. One way I can look at you, the other way I can touch you. Look at me. I want to look at you. Everything's going to be all right now, Tony. It will always be all right. Why didn't you answer my letters? Because you told me not to. You warned me 1,000 times not to. Not in my last three letters. Since the end of October, I've only had one letter from you, and that said you never wanted to see me again. I never wrote any such thing. [Doorbell rings] [Ring] [Ring] [Ring] Oh, no. Why did you come now? Because of the letter you wrote me. That stupid thing? Was it stupid? I didn't read it. I only heard the first line, where you said you love me. Is your name Johnson? Yes. A. Johnson? Yes. Oh, my god. And I thought it would be a young man. You want the other Johnson. Take a seat and wait if you like. It's no business of mine. The other Johnson? Don't give me that. I told the office there'd been a disaster at home. I took my coat... And walked out. Aren't you pleased? Helen, I was half-dead with heartbreak and you ask me if I'm pleased? I wish I'd been able to read your letter, line for line. After the first line, you didn't miss much. Where is she? Oh, god! Open the door! My wife's in there! I know it! No! No! Open it or I'll shoot the lock off! I'll give you 10 seconds! To Trinity road, please. Go away! Go... Go away. Leave me alone. Oh, my god. Roger. You two, come on. Move on. There's nothing to be seen here. Captioning made possible by vidmark entertainment captioning performed by national captioning institute, inc.
