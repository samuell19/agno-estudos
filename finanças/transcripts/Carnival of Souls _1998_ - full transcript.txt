Mommy? Mommy? How many times do I have to tell you? Louis, what are you doing? I ask for a meal... Stop it. I won't stop it! Louis, please! Stop it! You're hurting me! What's wrong with you? Nothin'. Here's something new? Stop it! Stop it! Come on! Stop it! Stop it! You're a bitch. Leave her alone! Stop it, Louis! Leave us all alone! Please don't hurt my mommy. Alex, I gotta go. Sid's got the bar, OK? Yeah. I forgot it was today. Don't you need a jacket? I'm fine. Don't worry about me so much. Bye. Have fun. Yeah. You all right? Come here. There we go. Feel better? All right. Now, open up. Open up, there we go. Now tell me, Alex... Did you miss me? Come on. We're going to a party. It is the anniversary of your mother's death. I suggest you start driving. I don't know how long I'll be able to stay inside without pulling the trigger. All right, then. Just drive. Go on. You've really grown up. Turned into quite the lady, very mature. And very sexy. Wait a minute... This is new. I'll bet you got all the boys dreaming about trying to get their hands on these? The things you could tell them? The things I could tell them? Now, 20 years is a long time in between drinks, but I'll bet you haven't forgotten about me. Well, I'm trying to forget, too. Forget and forgive, forgive and forget. You can turn right at the light. Where the fuck are we going? Don't curse! It cheapens both of us! Where are we going? A familiar place. You know, jail is a great place to think, Alex. And I must say, not a day went by when I didn't think about you. I just knew we'd work it all out someday. 'Cause I never hold a grudge once I get even. Right, boys? You just take us down there to the old fun house. There is one thing I regret, though. What's that? I regret you're not going to be around for the grand finale... The maddest of tea parties. You always were the showman, Louis. It's gonna be quite a show, I promise you. And the best part... Is what I'm gonna do with that little cupcake sister of yours. You stay away from her. "You stay away from her!" Well, I can't do that. I'm sorry you won't be there to see it, but we've all got to make our little sacrifices. Know what I mean? Yeah. I think I do. Showtime. What's going on in there? Come on, Alex, what's going on? Alex, you're flooding the whole damn place. I must have fallen asleep. Did it seep through? Hell, yeah, Alex... That's why I've been banging the door down. Look at this. What a mess. What a nightmare. Yeah, well, shit happens. I just don't see why it needs to happen around here so much. Where's Sandra? Said she had some singing thing. Left in a big hurry. I'm sure of that. Hey, sweetheart... How about exercisin' those great legs of yours and bringin' a fresh beer for an old man? Tell you what... How about an old beer for a fresh man? That beer's not so old. By the way, where's your partner? Don't know. She's supposed to be here. Maybe she thought we could use some time alone. Yeah, and maybe Alex might let us drink for free all night. Maybe. And unlikely. Hey, which one's the maybe? Alex, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Hey! Yo, chill! Did you have a nice afternoon? Oh, please. They were running two hours late. I was gonna blow it off, and then they called me. Do you know how to use one of these? You pick it up, dial, listen for the ringing sound... Alex... I was gonna call you. I was. But there was one phone in the whole place, I swear. You've got customers. Hello, customers. Well, good night, ladies. You leaving, Sid? Yup. I'll miss you. See you tomorrow. Get some sleep. You, too. Hey... try a bed this time. I heard you had quite a bath today, Alex. I was having that nightmare again. You were? Well, now we just have one more thing to fix before we sell this taco stand. I'm doing everything I can to fix this place up so we can get out of here. Well, maybe the first part of that's true. What's that supposed to mean? What it means is that you've been talking about getting us out of here for a while. I'm sorry you had a bad dream. Good night. I love you. Watch your step. It's a little slippery on the bottom. How bad is it? You'll see. Shit. Hello? Hello? Ma'am? Can I help you? Mercer, sit. I need a pump. Oh, don't we all? You local? Yeah. Well, where do you live? The old mermaid inn, just down the road a bit. I've got a flood in my basement. Do you have a pump or something that I could rent? Oh, yeah. I-I'm sure I've got something lying around out back. Would that do it for you, then? Yeah. And this. Did you say you were from the old mermaid bar? Yes. Funny... I thought they closed that place down. No. Not yet, anyway. Hey, is your car dirty? Well, if it is, you come on down to Cal's car wash, all right? ♪ It was on a warm summer evening ♪ ♪ The Jasmine hung thick in the air... ♪ Well, howdy. Welcome to Cal's. Have we got a special today. Our executive car wash is only $12.99. Just fluff and fold. You know, for only an extra dollar you can get the hot wax and the super deluxe vinyl treatment. No thanks. Well, you seem like a nice girl. I'll tell you what I'm gonna do... I'm gonna throw it in for free. ♪ I heard the wind... Help me! Help me! Will you? Won't you? Will you? Won't you? Won't you join the dance? Go on. This one's especially for you. What's your name? Alex. Hello, Alex! I'm Louis. You're not here at the carnival by yourself, are you? I lost my mommy. Lost your mommy? Well... I'm sure she's around here somewhere. Wanna go to the fun house? It's fun. Thank god... there you are! Honey, I've been looking all over for you. You can't just wander off like that. Are you OK, sweetheart? You must be mommy. Elaine. Don't be too hard on her. We were just gonna come looking for you. Ain't that right, Alex? I was terribly worried. I just turned around for a minute, and she was gone. It's so hard to keep track of two little ones. Well, you can't be expected to do it all alone. Where's daddy tonight? Daddy's where the balloons fly. Well, hello there. What's your name? Sandra. Well, Sandra, if your daddy's with the balloons, I bet he's having a wonderful time. Do you like balloons? No. She doesn't like balloons. Honey! Well, thank you for finding Alex. Actually, I didn't find her. She found me. Gotcha! Well, either way, I'm very grateful. Then perhaps you'd let me buy you a drink sometime? I tell you what... I run the mermaid bar a few miles down the road. Why don't you come by and I'll buy you a drink? It would be my pleasure. Enjoy the rest of the carnival. And remember... The fun is just beginning. Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you. Are you looking for someone? No, I was just... Just looking. Yeah. I used to come here when I was a kid. Are you a cop? No, no, not really. But I am in charge of patrolling this property and technically you are trespassing. I'm sorry. I was just... Don't sweat it. It'll be our little secret. Nice boat. Thanks. It's not much, but it gets me around. Would you like to go for a ride? No, I really don't like the water. A harbor's a funny place to live for someone who doesn't like the water. I'm Michael. Alex. Alex. Well, Alex, maybe sometime you'll let me take you for a ride. Maybe I will. Until we meet again. Will we? I think we might. Hey there. Hey. I got some spackle for the ceiling. And a pump for the cellar. There's no leak in the bathroom. I don't know where that water's coming from. It does look like I'm gonna have to do some spackling. I appreciate it. Things under control here? Yeah, yeah, it's pretty dead in here tonight. Wait a minute... You left it at the bar last night. I did? Yeah. Left it in the tip jar, told me to hang on to it for you. I... don't remember. Well, thanks. Yeah, no problem. Hey... You OK? Yeah. Fine. You could bottle that stuff and sell shots of it for a buck. I know at least a couple of people who would try it. Yeah, but then they'd want it all the time. So it looks like they might be setting up the old carnival out there? I doubt it. There hasn't been a carnival out there in over 20 years. Sid? Who's there? Who's there? No... No what? Nothing. Wanna know what little girls are made of? Sugar and spice and everything nice. Get away! Alex! Stop! It's me! It's me. I was washing my face. I couldn't breathe. Can you breathe now? Where did this come from? Told you... I know what you told me. Where did it come from? I don't know, Alex. I never saw it before last night. You didn't see anybody leave it on the bar? Nobody handed it to you? Yes. You did. Is it bad? I don't know what it is. How'd you like to drink for free tonight? Sounds like you need a favor. I do. This the guy? Yeah, that's him. You sure? Positive. You went through this pretty carefully. Oh, yeah. He was quite a charmer. Had numerous arrests for questionable behavior around children. And quite a penchant for little girls. Managed to stay out of reach by moving from one carnival to the next... That is until he was convicted of rape and murder in 1977 and sentenced to life in prison. Yeah, I know that. I'm sure you do. The report says it was your testimony that put him away. That's quite a lot to handle for a 12-year-old. I was 11. He served his term in folsom and was paroled in '96. And? And I suppose you think he's come to thank you for the vacation? Something like that. Yeah, well, I wouldn't count on it. Have you got a strong stomach? Now you tell me, Alex... Does that look like someone who's about to come knocking on your door? Sometimes bad memories have a way of following you around. You know what I'm saying? I am not crazy. I'm sorry, Alex. I don't know what I can do to help you. You need to wait until it dries, Sid. I'll be an old man by then. Come on, we're just gonna have to do it again. Nope, I've almost got it... Damn it! I'm sorry, Alex. "I'm sorry, Alex"? How about listening to me for once? Feels good, doesn't it? I have to get Sandy to the doctor. You two gonna be... Oh, honey, that's great! Is Louis turning you into a clown? Will you be staying for dinner? Probably not. Mommy... It's OK, sweetheart. I'll be back in a little while. You remember your bedtime, OK? Alex? Can I come in? It's quite a look for you. Bad day? I've had better. Apparently. I've been seeing things. Have you? Things that can't be real. What? I thought I saw Louis. Really? Was he riding the Loch Ness monster? Sandra, it's not funny. No, it's not funny. It's not funny at all. Al, this place isn't right for us. I can handle it. Can you? And how come you look like this? And how come every time I turn around something else is broken? I'm getting it together. Why is it that every time someone offers to buy this shithole, it's not good enough for you? Not good enough for us. Fuck that! Why don't you just admit to me that you don't really want to sell this place at all? Because I don't. This is mom's place. I know it's not much. But it's all that we have left of her. If we let it go... Our memories of her will go with it. I have a present for you. I was saving this for your birthday. Remember how scared you were to ride the Ferris wheel? Yeah. Till mom told me it was like jumping, except you never really fall. It's all right there. It's all right here. And no one can take that away from you. I'm not ready to go. I know. But you're closer than you think. And until then... I guess we'll just have to stick around here... Till you feel like you can take those memories with you. In the meantime, why don't you take it easy tonight? But the bar... I'll worry about the bar. I owe you one, anyways. Thanks. Hey, get out of here! You're not ready yet! Let me out of here! Hi, Dr. Goldfine, please? Yes, this is Alex Grant. I'm a patient of his. Yes, I need to see him again. No, no, I... I don't... I can't wait that long. Fine. Yeah, I understand. Yeah. I-I'll do that. How can then voice of dread, With bitter tidings laden, shall summon to unwelcome bed a melancholy maiden? But not yet! Wanna do my makeup? But your face is already done. We're not gonna do my face. Thanks. Yeah. Listen, I'm sorry I snapped at you last night. I-I'm just kind of... Hey. It's all right. I know you've been having a hard time. It's gonna be OK, though. I hope you know that. Thanks. Look, let me get you some more longnecks. Alex? You doing OK? Me? I feel great. You're a great bartender, Alex, but you're a terrible liar. A penny for your thoughts. Henry... Do you ever think a person knows that they're going crazy? I don't know. I think there's far more people who think they know when someone else is goin' crazy. Hey, Alex... Yes? Two beers. Alex, behind you. All right... you tip on the tabs. These guys wanna hear me sing. Do they? Yeah. But I told them we're busy, so... So, you've got a good audience. Go ahead. I'll take care of things back here. Yeah? Yeah. ♪ Mama always warned me ♪ dangers often hide ♪ mama always told me ♪ villains can be kind ♪ look before you love ♪ and trust before you look she's very good. Yeah, she is. You two are pretty close? I don't think there's anything I wouldn't do for her. ♪ Sinners I have known ♪ and their signs I understand ♪ but a man whose eyes show ♪ no lies ♪ and no blame ♪ no disguise ♪ and no shame can I get you something? No thanks. I don't like to drink. A bar's a funny place for someone who doesn't like to drink. What do you like? You know, I could be wrong, but I get a feeling you might be flirting with me. I'm just making conversation. It's part of the job, you know. Yeah, I know. And she who flirts with all is less likely to fall than she who flirts with just one. Right? Alex? Let me buy you a drink. Take the edge off. Buy me one later. You're not afraid, are you? I'm not afraid. But you will be. You will be. Great. What's up with you? Nothing. I'm fine. You been sneaking martinis behind the bar? No, I'm fine. Ok. Did you tell him I was here? Well? What did he say? He said he would be with you shortly. Alex Grant. Yes? The doctor is ready for you now. It's down the hall and to the right. Yes, I know where it is. Thank you for seeing me on such short notice. I felt that it just couldn't wait. What's going on? Well, I've been having the... You know, the stress thing. Like right after the accident. Car accident? Yes. I've been telling myself that everything's... Fine and that I'm OK. Everything's not fine, and I'm not OK. What seems to be the problem? I've been seeing things. What is it that you've been seeing? Louis. I've been seeing Louis. And... Have you tried talking to him about that? He's dead. I see. Don't you remember? You counseled me right after the accident. You said... Look, I think I need some help here. Alex, I will try my best to help you. Can I smoke in here? Of course. How long ago did this accident take place? 5 months ago. Are you telling me that you can't remember back 5 months? Yes, we keep excellent records, and I like to think I keep very good track of my patients. Good, you can pull my file, and you can see that I'm not some kind of wacko. There is no file on you. What do you mean there's no file? I've never met you before today. Who are you? Alex, please. Look, I would like to... Suggest... Alex? I take it that one's not worth remembering. Now you're trespassing. I know. I was wondering if you're ready for that boat ride. I can't leave Sandra alone. I have a feeling she can take care of herself. I like your necklace. Thanks. It belonged to my mother. Before she died. It reminds me of her. Memento Mori. May I? Yeah. She died too soon. How do you know that? Because I saw it. But you can't know that. Only she can know if she was ready to die. Trust me, she wasn't ready. That may be true, but it's a very personal thing. One dies when she wants, as she wants, of what she chooses. My mother chose a man she thought she could trust. Memento Mori doesn't mean to remember the dead, anyway. What is it, then? To remember that we all must die. I have to get to work. I know it sounds impossible, but I know he's here. Come on, Al, Louis is dead, remember? Ok... Let me put it this way. If Louis were still creeping around the house, which he is not, but if he were, and he wanted to get you, why wouldn't he have gotten you sooner? Because that wouldn't be any fun. OK, whatever. I'm out of here. I'm ready to get out of here, too. Excuse me? I said I want to leave and not come back. That's great. That's great. I think there's hope for you yet. I got to go. Wait... What? Take this with you. Thank you very much. You're going out like that? Yes, I'm going out like this. What? I said I'll be fine. Try not to worry about me so much. It's supposed to rain later, and... Alex... I'll be fine. Hello? Sandra? Sandra! Sorry, miss, we're not open yet. Oh, Alex, hi! I didn't see it was you. Come on, don't look so surprised. I told you I never hold a grudge once I get even. You know... I think I've figured out your problem. Well, one of your problems. You don't know how to have any fun. See, aren't you glad we met? I curse the day you ever found me. Am I bleeding? I think I've been cut. You've still got it wrong, Alex. I didn't find you. You found me. You can find me again, Alex. You've always known where to find me. No! I'll take you. I feel like I'm going to hell. Sometimes you have to face your demons in order to see the angels, Alex. It's time to let go. I can't. I haven't lived yet. Then why are you here? Michael. I'm late. I'm late for a very important date. Watch where you're going. I told you to watch where you're going. Gotcha! Help me, Alex! Please don't leave me here. Don't leave me alone with him. Please! It's you he wants! Nice of you to join us, Alex. Remember this? This is my favorite part. Shame you caught me and your mother doing it, too. Might not have had to kill her. You would have anyway. She knew you could only get it up with little girls. You know, guilt is a funny thing, Alex. It haunts you as real as any ghost. I think you're just too scared to admit it. Which is fine with us, by the way, because the longer you hang on, the longer we get to play. I'm just hanging on long enough to blow your fucking head off. Don't be hasty. You wouldn't hurt a clown, would you? Will I? Won't I? You don't have the guts. Will I? Won't I? Won't I join the dance? Come on, Sandra! Sometimes bad memories have a way of following you around. I said I'll be fine. Quit worrying about me so much. You're not afraid, are you? Sid, voice-over: I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN HAVING A HARD TIME. It's going to be OK, though. I hope you know that. Al? Alex? That looks like your car. Ain't this where they had that carnival? Carnival? Hasn't been a carnival out here in 20 years. Did you notice any strange behavior? Mood swings? When was the last time you saw her? Excuse me. Hello. Hello?
