BELLE EPOQUE In the winter of 1930... after the failure of the anti-monarchical rebellion in Jaca... a young soldier left his barracks... and wandered the countryside as a deserter... trying to lead his own life. February, 1 931. Somewhere in Spain. Halt! Hands up! - I was just... - Where are you from? Madrid. Where are you going? Answer the sergeant. - Where are you going? - I don't know. You're a deserter? Long live Galan and Garcia Hernandez! - He's probable come from Jaca. - Hold it. He's shouting subversive things. - Were you stationed in Jaca? - No, sir. Well, then? I support the Republic. I don't understand this. A Republican with a bible! Wait. Should we let him go? You're kidding! The Republic might win. It's still our country. Our country is the government. And our government may change. So what? The sooner we serve the side that's most likely to win... the better. We must respect the existing ruler. Those are our orders. In the revolution of 1854... our founder, the Marquis of Ahumada... was thrown out for defending the government. No way. The Civil Guard stays out of politics. The chief says so. Yeah, and pigs can fly! Whoever invented tobacco... should have been hung from a meat hook. To health and the Republic! What are you doing? - I'm free? - Stop! Trust your father-in-law, damn it! No! I'll be court-martialed! Lower your gun or I'll shoot you! Fuck it, Juan! I'll shoot. You'd shoot your children's grandpa? I'll do it! You don't have the balls. Don't I? The son of a bitch shot me! Don't shoot! Can you hear me? Juan! Sir! I killed him! I killed him. Now what? What will I tell my wife? I want to die! I want to die! I'll kill myself! I'll kill myself! He was the kindest man. And it was over nothing. Over absolutely nothing. Fuck all the laws! Fuck the public ordinances! And the Marquis of Ahumada and the Holy Virgin, too! Good evening. Hey. Are there any whores here? There's one. And she's terrific. How much for the night? That's a big question. Talk to Polonia. Upstairs. - Sixty. - I pass. - Sixty. - I pass. Eighty. May I come in? Why do you all keep coming upstairs? I've told you not to. They told me to ask for Polonia. What is it, son? How much is it for the whole night? For handsome boys, ten pesetas. - But you'll have to wait till midnight. - Why? Because until then we get customers. What time is it? Are we playing or not? It's almost 9:00. Did you eat? No. Meanwhile, eat some rabbit. My niece shouldn't miss out on a young man like you. Go on, sit down, love. Where are you going? Make room for the boy. - Cold, eh? - Sure. It's winter. This won't do. Either we play or we don't. Don Luis! An extreme unction. Oh, shit! Just a minute! What about the game? I'm sorry, but you heard. As the sheriff, I have to go with Don Luis. It can't be, Don Luis. You, in a brothel! Precisely. wherever there's sin, that's where I must be. - Why did you bring HolyJoe? - He just came along. Anyway, who is dying? Prudencio. The mule kicked his brains out. Our days are numbered. God must exist. As soon as the priest wins... Divine Providence sends him a viaticum... to let him leave with his winnings. Extreme unction. What's the difference? Viaticum means giving the Eucharist. Extreme unction means applying the holy oils. Here, son. wet you whistle. He knows plenty about the church. Maybe he can even play cards. Well, sort of. So much the better for us. Eat up, and then we'll play. What the hell is that? - Rascal! what did you do? - Nothing, I swear. I deserted. I was stationed in Madrid. Just look inside my suitcase. Damn! The de Valera version! Are you a Protestant? No, sir. I'm an agnostic. All right, son, come along. You'll come home with me. - I'll remove those. - Then... Encarna will be waiting for you. I feel sorry about the sergeant. This discipline business is shit. Once you accept it... discipline can make you kill your own mother if necessary. The guard said that. A brave animal. And it must be said, he did sing very well. Flamenco, I mean. Yes, man... I've had three big frustrations in my life. I see you've got the knack. A little. Three frustrations that embittered my life. It looks good. The seminary's rector called it divine. Were you the cook there? Being on scholarship still meant doing some work. They called it being a servant. And since I was a good cook... What about your frustrations? Ah, yes. The first was not being born among heathens. Because once you're baptized, they've ruined you forever. Why? Don't you priests say that baptism... leaves an indelible mark on the soul? I only spent six years in the seminary. The second was not being called up because of my feet. So, I couldn't desert. Drink up. You'd better get rid of that uniform and the bugle. - Throw them in the fire. - I can't. They'll give you away. They're not mine. I must return them. An honorable decision. How will you return them? By mail? No. when we have a republic. And your third frustration? It's something awful. Since I can only get it up with my wife... I haven't been able to be unfaithful. You see the paradox. Since I couldn't rebel against either the church or the army... or matrimony, all of which, aside from banking... are the most reactionary existing institutions... here I am, an infidel, a rebel... and a libertine by nature... living like a scared old bourgeois. Hey... this is the best damn cod I ever tasted. Come in, come in. You'd better sleep here. There's a stove. Whatever you say, sir. Stop that! Don't be so damn formal. Throw some wood in the stove. My wife. Damned woman. What? Are we sleeping together? If you want to sleep alone, go to another room. But, believe me, this house is an icebox. What's more, you can read me to sleep. Are you queer? No, nothing like that. I told you, except with my wife... I'm totally impotent. It might be my age. Insomnia, I mean. Go ahead, read me something from the bible. New Testament or Old? It doesn't matter. It's just for falling asleep. Read any page it opens to, the way the British do. "Because the fate of the sons of men and of the beasts... is the self same fate. The first die, and so do the others." Damn! It's Ecclesiastes. We're doing well. "And so do the others. And they have the self same breath. Man has no advantage over beast, for all is vanity. Both go to the same place. Both come from dust and both return to dust. Who knows whether man's spirit rises upward... or the beast's spirit descends into the earth?" Ah, there's the rub. "I see there is nothing better for man... than to be happy in his work, for this is his lot. Because who can show him what will happen after him?" Hello, Don Manolo. Hello, Palomo. What's the damn mayor doing here? He's waiting for the band that's coming for the carnival. What a country, Fernando! Spain is on the brink of a new era... and the mayor's office arranges carnivals. Good morning, Don Manolo. Hello, Jesus. Fernando, I'm really sorry you're leaving. I'd have to leave some day. I wanted to tell you, not only have I been eating like a priest... but I've had someone to chat with. I wouldn't have minded if you stayed. But now, with my daughters coming, it's different. - You understand my position? - Hell, yes. It's because I never had any sons... that's why I became fond of you. And I of you. Well, write to me as soon as you have an address. Don't worry. - There it is. - My train or your daughters? We'll see. Here. No, really, I don't need it. Go on, take it! It's the train from Madrid. There they are. Well, as they say, to health and the Republic. I wish you much luck! Dad! Clara! Violeta! Dad, how are you? Dad! You're so handsome! You're the ones that are good-looking. Luz, give me a kiss. - He looks messy, as usual. - Don't start nagging, woman! - I smell anisette. - That's nothing new! She's just like your mother. Get your suitcases and we'll go home. Who is this? A friend. But he's off to Madrid. Good-bye, Fernando. Let's go. The buggy's outside. What prompted you to come here so suddenly? Don't you know what's happening? Madrid is awful. Demonstrations, fights, strikes, shootings. The newspapers arrive here three days late. Here, Violeta. - Anything else? - No. It's just as well. There's so much shit! - You fixed it? - Yes. It was blocked. You can wear Mother's dress. Are you tired of cleaning? Forget the dresses. Help me. I won't go to the dance. - Why not? - I don't dance to minstrels. And the men here are brutes. They get two mules to pull a plow into the dance and ruin it. Dad told us. Remember? - Speak of the devil. - Luz, open the door. Why is it always me? The fellow from the station! It's that I missed the train. - Is Manolo in? - No, but he won't be long. Go that way. Luz, who was it? Clara, this boy came to see Dad. Good afternoon. Am I disturbing you? Not at all. Come in. The carnival is tomorrow. He's Dad's friend from the station. He missed the train. I went to the village, but there's no inn there. And since I had stayed here with Manolo, I thought... maybe... No, I was stationed at the Madrid aerodome. Galan and Garcia Hernandez were shot on December 1 4... but the uprising continued and the radio announced... "The Republic has been proclaimed in Madrid. Play the bugle." Since I was the bugler, I played it. - Play! - Ignore her! Continue. Planes flew over Madrid to see what was happening. But nothing was happening. And Ramon Franco wouldn't bomb the palace... because he saw children playing in the nearby square. - Little angels! - When did you escape? When the government troops arrived... I saw our leaders get on planes headed for Portugal. So I changed clothes, packed and left. Where did you go? To the mountains. I stayed there over a month. What did you eat? Whatever I found. Especially cabbage. Lots of cabbage. The farms, sure. What about sleeping? Wherever I could. Often in churches. I'd hide until they closed up, lie on a bench. - Candles kept me warm. - Where were you headed? - To La Coruna. - La Coruna? - To stow away to America. - It's a good thing you met Dad. - Play something. - You think a bugle is like a saxophone? Anyway, he's eating. No, I don't mind. The regular reveille or with flourishes? So then I told Unamuno... "No, Don Miguel, you're mistaken." You know what he's like, right? Imagine how he reacted. I can imagine. When did he last write to you? What's that? That, my dear Luis, is the fucking seminarian. He missed his train when he got a whiff of my daughters. Don't be an ass! - Beautiful. - And so lively! - How lovely! - What lungs! Good evening. Dad, look who's here! You missed the train. - Am I right? - Yes. - How are you, Don Luis? - Not as well as you, girls. You get prettier every day. What smells so good? This Fernando is a great cook. I already knew that. To health and the Republic, son. Thank God you didn't leave. What is it? Chicken casserole. I went to the village... but there's no inn. You could have gone to Polonia's. How could he go to that dump? I didn't think of it. Encarna is there. She's probably still waiting for you. Here, Mother. Is everybody ready? One, two. We seem to be in for a musical evening. It's the teacher! These are the melodies that King David would sing To the pretty girls And now we sing them to you Awaken, my love, awaken Look, the dawn is here Little birds are singing And the moon hides her face Little birds are singing And the moon hides her face - Son, they're going inside. - Clara, wait! Can we come in? My mother's here. I swear, that boy gets crazier every day. That often happens to teachers. Working with children makes them childish. Come in. How are you, Dona Asun? Awful, my dear, just awful. Now the guards are committing suicide. Two at a time, yet. These are bad times for decent people. But weren't you in mourning? Mourning is carried on in the heart, Dona Asun. I wasn't talking to you. Long live Christ the King! Long may He live. How can you receive in this house... a priest who is the shame of his church? - Who's this? - A cousin of ours. Very handsome. Where were we? The bracelet, Mother. You have it? Then give it to her. No! First you must speak to her. Well, I would have preferred joining up with... a Carlist family, but still... a Republican one is better than some Bourbons. Make your point, Mother. Since Juanito is an only child... I spoil him, so here we are. Luz! I know! The door! May I have another drink? When he heard that the girls were here... he washed his feet and said, "Mother... let's take the band and serenade Manolo's house, and then... let's ask for her hand." whose hand? My girlfriend's. - You never told us. - What was there to tell? My grandmother got engaged with that bracelet. So did my mother and I. Did you tell her I'd be living with you? Later, Mother. Do you like it? Yes, it's really beautiful. You want to marry him? I don't know. We'll see. Did we ever discuss marriage? I wrote you a poem about it. You don't love him? Thank you, my dear. We'll go home. Who's better for you than your mother? - No, wait. - It's not my fault. It's lust. He's blinded by lust. - They've burned the church! - The sexton's gone crazy! He's burned the church. Damn him to hell! Where's my beret? What got into him? This heretic priest himself probably inspired him. Madame, don't start up! I wouldn't give him a raise... so he decided to become an anarchist. Let's go, Juanito. - Where to? - To the church, to do penance. Rocio, tell her we're engaged. Tell her how we fell in love last summer fishing for crabs. Careful, there's a loose step. I found it. You'll be very comfortable. Well. They're made of maize leaves. They're so soft. Hand me the sheets. You saw that fool? There's nothing between you two? We're just good friends. Last summer we fooled around a little, that's all. The summers here are such fun. If you had been here in summer, things would have been different. - Why? - We come here every summer. - We come here every year. - And do what? Many things. We go on excursions, have picnics... swim in the river. Fish for crabs. Don't get dirty thoughts. Juanito means nothing to me. But because he's so rich, he thinks we're all after him. Give me the heater. You'll see, you'll be so warm. What do you want for breakfast? I'll cook breakfast. Oh, that's right. We're not good at cooking. - Dad must have told you. - Yes. What will you do? Me? I mean for breakfast. Do you like fried bread? Yes. More than anything. If I come here in summer, we'll go to the river? To fish for crabs? If you want. What are you doing? See you in the morning. I almost forgot. In case you need it. The heater! No, really, I mean it. Rocio! what was that? Nothing. Nothing. I'm coming, Dad. Yes, and then? I told him we spend summers here... and have a great time, and he wants to come next year. To catch crabs, obviously. Forget the crabs! Can't he just come swimming? The poor boy. Who? Fernando? No. Higinio. Why bring up your husband? Higinio drowned in the river. Oh, of course. Whenever I'm reminded... Well, don't remind yourself! He cooked such good paella that day. Remember? He had a way with rice. Rice was all he could cook. That's true. Instead of paella, he should have made me a baby. Go on. Then I was putting the heater between the sheets... and suddenly he kissed me. Was he naked? Listen to that child! Child! You think being a virgin makes me an idiot? Luz, please! So he kissed you, and you fled downstairs. You idiot! Fernando's so gorgeous! Well, forget about him. We don't want any problems with that seminarian. "And the signatories are at your service... ready to unite within one party... and proposing to form a broad coalition... to serve the Republic." who are the signatories? The first ones are: Jose Ortega y Gasset... Gregorio Maranon and Ramon Perez de Ayala. All nobodies! What about Don Miguel? I don't see his name, but so what? The fact is, the King accepted Berenguer's resignation... and met with Romanones. Dad, we're back! - Come on, Fernando. - So long, Don Luis. Let's see what that meddler, Romanones, does next. If Unamuno didn't sign... Hello, Fernando. He's such a bore about that damn Don Miguel. He doesn't understand that Unamuno is a poet, not a thinker. Forgive your people, Lord Forgive your people Forgive them, Lord - Dad? - Yes, dear. - Can I go to the dance? - Who said you couldn't? You see? Do not be eternally annoyed Forgive them, Lord It's too big for me. - What are you doing? - Choosing our costumes. - What will you wear? - Nothing. I'm not going. You're not going? Go and enjoy yourself. You still can. I don't know. I won't wear a costume. I think this would suit you. - His suspenders! - What are you doing? Leave me alone! I'm not going like this. It's embarrassing. - You look great. - Don't be silly. Go on ahead. I'll go in later. You're a real mess. Let me. Do this. You're so pretty! Shit! Make way! Make way! Make way for the dwarf baby. Rocio. How handsome. What's your disguise? Disguise? It was my grandpa's uniform. - It suits you. - That's why I'm wearing it. - I won't dance. - Neither will I. Here. Your letters and photos. What's this all about? You hear that? What about last night? Don't blame me if your mother's a reactionary. Leave Mother out of this! Look. Here. "Dear Juanito. I got your poem and was so surprised." Signed by you. Didn't you know I wanted to marry you? Do you think marriage is like buying a pound of meat? - Am I right or not? - Fine. Then return Mother's bracelet. No, I won't. You won't return it? Come here, you fool, 'cause you are a fool. Are we engaged or not? - I am. You're not! - I am, silly. These things take time, don't you understand? Get us some drinks, then we'll talk. - Drinks? - Yes, real cold ones. - It's really a shame. - What is? You treat him so badly. What can I do? He's a jerk. That's true, too. With Romanones in power, I feel calm. All this "Republic" business will peter out. Sure. You'll remain the mayor and lend out money at 50% interest. Better an honest man like me... than a man like the sexton. Anyway, what's wrong with the new government? Wrong? Nothing. What a cabinet! Minister of State: Romanones. Landowner... advisor to the Spanish Bank of Credit. Would you prefer a gang of revolutionaries? Is Alcale Zamora a revolutionary? He goes to Mass every day. Go to hell, man! Aren't you jealous? - Of whom? - Of those two. Yes. Yes, I'm jealous. The drinks. And I forgive you. - Let's dance. - No, no. Didn't you forgive me? Yes, but the Church has banned the tango. - You don't say! - Pope Pius X banned it. - What's the Pope know about dancing? - He knows everything. He's infallible. It's shameful. - What's wrong? - I'm not dancing anymore. Pigeon, you alone? Leave me alone! Look, sweetheart, don't play innocent. Let's go. Wait, my shoe came off. Fuck! You acted just like a man. That's what I am. Damn. Easy. Come on. Climb up. - Here? - Go on. Now what? What do you think? Put your tongue like this. Now blow. Blow, for fuck's sake! You know, he wouldn't dance a tango last night? It's his mother's influence. Do you love him or not? I think I do, because the idiot is lovable. But I don't like him. To marry a man, you should like him, right? That's the theory. You think I liked Higinio at first with all that hair in his nose? - So? - Eventually I got used to him. Now I miss him more each day. Because you don't see the hair. I'd miss Juanito, too. Don't kid yourself. Women can't be without men. - Especially at night. - You're right. - Even Violeta. - What do you mean? Swear you won't tell anyone? I swear. Tell what? Violeta! Hello, Fernando. Have you seen Violeta? - Look. - What is it? A sheet. Can you guess what it's for? - No idea. - Come, you'll see. - Where? - The studio. You'll like it. - What studio? - Dad's. Didn't he tell you he's a painter? I haven't been here for years. I left it the day I realized that painting was finished. I thought, why keep painting if it's all been done before? I decided I'd respect the canvas. My last creation. Mother says Dad's lazy. She may be right, but you know how she is. A Russian copied it from me. His name's Malevich. But look at the date. Mine predates his by a year. Manolo, I have something to tell you. Go ahead. It's that I'm in love. I knew it. That's why I told you to leave when they arrived. Now, at best, I gain a son-in-law and lose a friend. We'll always be friends. Don't kid yourself. So, who's the lucky one? - Rocio, right? - No, no. Violeta. Violeta? If you go to town, buy me matches. Buy your own matches, you tramp! - What's wrong? - What do you think? She'd gotten her hopes up. No. I haven't eaten. Drink. You'll need it. This is just like one of those novels. What I mean is, your love is impossible. Why? Because Violeta... We'll see. Have you told her? Told her? There's no need to after what happened last night. Don't tell me... that there was copulation? A miracle! This is a miracle! Violeta! Violeta! Child, give me a kiss! - What's this all about? - A kiss, girl! Make my first grandchild a boy! I'm fed up with having only women in this family. Idiot! why did you tell? I couldn't lie to him. Last night means nothing! You understand? Nothing! Get out of my sight! What's wrong? I want to get married. Poor guy! How can you marry a man? What's wrong? The bitch. What an idiot! Don't blame her. It's all Mother's fault. After I was born, Mother wanted a boy. All the baby's clothes she bought were blue. She was obsessed. She dressed her like a boy until her first period. But Manolo, your dad... Didn't he say anything? No. He was too involved with his painting and stuff. I think Vioteta was influenced a lot by confession. Aren't you all atheists? Yes, but we went to communion as kids... because Mother liked dressing us up to look pretty. Well, Violeta looked handsome because she wore a sailor suit. What happened with confession? Since Violeta confessed on the boys' side... the priest talked to her about obscene behavior. Imagine! - I can imagine! - That's why... Juanito and his mother. What's going on? That pain, Juanito, wants me to try on his mother's wedding dress. It may need alterations. Don't you dare touch it, and don't get it dirty. Are they getting married? Juanito is a good match. You make the sandwiches, and I'll go see what they're doing. Well... Thanks for everything. And remember to give Manolo the bible. Don't be silly. I was married by a bishop. He was my uncle. The poor fellow died. would you have an uncle who's a bishop? - Or better, a cardinal? - No. - Can Juanito come in? - No. He's your fiance! What a divine dress. It looks lovely on you. Isn't she beautiful? But she has no uncle who's a bishop. Only poor people get married by a priest. It's the ceremony that counts. Right, my love? Sure, but a bishop looks better than a priest. Tell her about the honeymoon. Mother says... we should honeymoon in Rome. Would you like that, dear? She'll love seeing the Pope and the catacombs. - I don't know. - We could go to Paris. No, I mean the wedding. I'd rather wait for the Republic. Because under a Republic.... we'll be able to get a divorce. My son, divorce? Never! Take off the dress! Give me my dress, you shameless woman! With pleasure! And you can stick it up your ass! Rocio, please. Along with the veil! I'll tear out your filthy tongue! Calm down, Mother. Leave me alone, you slob. Grab her legs! She'll get over it tomorrow. I never want to see you again! But I didn't do anything. It was her. Juanito! I'm taking you to a monastery. Well, what do we do with her? Calm down, Dona Asun. Fernando, I'm so unhappy. Don't cry. You're so kind. The door... Forget the door and come here, you devil. You are a devil. Your pants... What was that? The wind. Don't stop. Like an idiot, I kept making omelets! Didn't you like it? Why wouldn't I? But how will I tell your father? Tell what? That I love you. But why tell him? If I don't, I'd be abusing his confidence. If you do, You'd be abusing mine. - I don't understand. - And Juanito? Then... do you love him? It's not that, but... What are you doing? Where are you going? To Madrid! Have you read The Magic Mountain? It's very well explained in that book. "Oh, charming organic beauty... not comprised of painting or stone... but of living, corruptible matter. Look at the shoulders and hips... and the flowery bosoms on both sides of the chest... and the ribs aligned in pairs... and the navel in the belly's softness... and the dark sex between the thighs! Let me feel your pores exhaling... and touch your down... a human image of water and albumen... destined to the anatomy of the tomb... and let me die... with my lips pressed to yours!" Such youth! Giddap, Lucero! Don Luis! What's your hurry? Let me ask you... what do I have to do to renounce? Renounce what? This! The Catholic religion! I'll pay any price! You? Renounce? You've just blessed yourself. It's over! what'll I do? Spit on you? Blaspheme? Sing the Republican anthem? If the priests only knew The beating they'd get they'd run out shouting Freedom, freedom I can't stand my mother! I want to be free! Free! Your mother is quite a mother, Juanito. Now, what's going on? She wants me to be a monk! I want to get married! That sounds fine. Why do you want to renounce? So Mother disowns me and I can marry Rocio, damn it! If you put it like that... But defection is a very serious matter, Juanito. So is the vow of chastity! You're telling me! I'm sorry. Do you believe in hell? I do, but she doesn't. Tell me what to do. I'll do it, and you'll give me the certificate. What certificate? To prove that I've left the Catholic Church. Then Rocio will see I'm done with Mother forever. She'll forgive me and marry me. You understand? It must be lunchtime. Great. Let's go. But shouldn't that be done here? Be quiet. Come along. You, help me. Hold the horse. Where to? To lunch. And the certificate? It'll be a verbal certificate, damn it! Good afternoon. The Church and the rich, hand in hand. Rocio, listen to the priest. It's my duty to advise you that this man renounced... the Holy Church... and has been excommunicated. What's for lunch? Man, a stew! What's this nonsense? You explain it. Excommunicated for your love, Rocio. I'll go to hell. Don't touch me! You only care about your mother! Don't you understand? That's why I renounced. My love, I'll explain... What happened? Nothing. Juanito just showed he's got balls. Excuse me. He renounced to free himself of... the maternal yoke. The Carlists have class. He's serious? Is there any soup left? Stew really needs soup. I'll get it. How can I allow such a stupidity? Even if I did, when his mother hears about it... She'll kill him. What's worse, she'll disinherit him. Don't laugh at him. What he just did only happens in novels. My mother doesn't count. She's a zero! We can honeymoon in Paris. Can we live in Madrid? Wherever you want! Honestly? Because I won't live here. And in summer we'll go to San Sebastian. Don't take it so hard. What? Do you think I'm stupid? Juanito! Not now! So, you're still here, eating your heart out. Can't Rocio marry anyone she wants? - She doesn't love him. - She does love him. In her own way, of course. She needs to get married. She's not like Violeta. Obviously not. I mean, since Violeta is a veterinarian.... and has a good job, she doesn't need anybody. While Rocio has no career. What can she do? Be a shop girl all her life? She said she's a secretary. No, the poor thing. She helps in the antique shop my husband left me. Because my husband... - Why did you bring me here? - Who, me? It wasn't you, it was me. It wasn't me, it was my feet. My own feet. He drowned right there. Your husband? Last summer. We were having a picnic here. Higinio didn't want to, but I wanted us to swim after lunch. He got a cramp. I can still see it. He was there, right there. Suddenly he went under. He never came up. I, like an idiot, thought he was diving. And he left me alone. Alone forever. But you have your father... your sisters... Fernando... a husband is a husband. I understand. But you can marry again. You're so young. So nice. So pretty. Clara, from the first moment... No, I'm very proper. Sure. You're crazy. I'll comfort you. Not by the river! Oh, Jesus! Fernando! Help! Wait! Lord, what'll I do? A rope! Where is there a rope? I'm drowning! Not you, Fernando! No! Grab this! Hold on tight! Please hold on! I'm so sorry. Give me your hand. Don't let go. Oh, God! Come on. It's water. I swallowed water. Forgive me, forgive me. Kiss me, my darling. It was my fault. Are you better? Tell me you're better. Yes. I'm better. - Come here. - Not by the river! Dear God! Yes, Fernando, yes! I don't know what's happening to me. Yes! A bunch of scoundrels. - Where's that from? - It came from Madrid. The best is the ending. "You must make sure that the monarchist triumph... appears to be based on true public opinion." - What's that? - An official government telegram. They're preparing to rig the elections. What nerve! - Why don't you go too? - Where? To the Villabuena meeting. - I'm not a Republican. - Some infidel! Are you joking with me? No. I'll go wherever necessary. Wait! I'm coming along! Good-bye, Rocio. Wait! Don't go! What happened? Fernando fell into the water. - The water? - Where? The river. where else? Why did you go to the river? What for? We were walking. Fernando hadn't been there before. Now he caught a chill. Some chill! It's pneumonia. How did it happen? Christ! Such an inquisition. People sometimes fall in the water. Get me to bed. I'm shivering. You have a high fever. Dry off and go to bed. That's what I said. Cover up well. Shouldn't he take a hot bath first? Why don't we call the doctor? All he needs is hot milk with brandy and an aspirin. - There's no brandy. - Give him anisette. That may not work. Get the heater. - Better get hot water bottles. - For his feet! How about eucalyptus vapors? It's important for him to sweat. Did you fall in too? Nonsense! I got wet pulling him out of the river. What was strange was... he fell in where Higinio drowned. Imagine how I felt. Luz, take the anisette. You won't believe this. That sneak wanted to kiss me, so I had to push him away. I can't explain it. Between remembering Higinio and being kissed by Fernando... I felt so strange. And he wanted to go to the meeting with Dad. Go on pretending! You sent me outside so I wouldn't hear something. What would we be talking about? What else but Fernando? If I find out, you'll see. Feeling better? It's pneumonia, believe me. Stop complaining. Take the aspirins and milk and you'll sweat. Shouldn't he inhale first? Wait, I'll get the bottles. - His feet are frozen! - And his forehead is burning. Sit up. Breathe deeply and you'll feel better. No. It reminds me of the water I swallowed. Give him the milk and the aspirins. Now, sweat it out. No. He's freezing. Don't worry, love. He'll warm up soon. Thank you so much. You're very kind. Let's let him sleep. Get well. Stay covered. Health and the Republic! - Health. - Down with the clergy! You want me to get out and hit you? He doesn't know me. I'll burn his church again tomorrow. See you tomorrow. What do you mean? Aren't you going home? I renounced my religion, became a Republican... and yelled, "Down with the clergy!" Should I go home now, kiss my mother... and say my prayers before going to bed? No. I'm staying here. Suit yourself. Where will you sleep? On the sofa. - It's me, your love! - Why are you here? - Don't wake Luz. - What do you want? You're so warm. You know what? We don't have to get married. Under the Republic, there'll be free love. Free love? They said so at the meeting. Ask your dad. What? What's going on? That opportunist! He wants free love. You little pig! That's why you turned Republican! Let me explain! Rocio, open up! You and I are finished for good. You hear? For good! I take it all back. I won't renounce! Catholic, Apostolic and Roman! And never a Republican! I'm a Carlist until I die! You saw that? Sneaking into my bed like a ghost! So what? Since you'll be marrying him... You're crazy. Don't even mention it. Let everyone know! I'm taking it all back! Our fathers died for God, fatherland and the king. For the same causes we too shall die Then die already, you idiot! Cost what it may King Don Carlos must enter through the gates of Madrid Finally! Where are you going? To drink water. Not by the river! No! I can't swim... I don't know how to swim. Clara! Not by the river! Lie down. Relax. Not the river. The hay loft... Hay loft. I love you, Violeta. I want to marry Rocio. Rocio... Clara... Violeta... What about me? No, not the water! In a mystical country There lived an old artist Whose magic flute Was all he owned He was so very poor That this pitiful flutist Slept in the treetops For lack of a home And the forest's birds Came to wake him up And the forest's birds Came to wake him up Then came the old flutist's turn to sing He sang proudly to the birds Amalia! Mother! It's Mother! I, too am an old bird Who filled the winter air with bird-like song Mother! You may sing Your laments of love I'll sing of the bitterness That's in my heart Mother! See, Danglard? They're prettier every year. Amalia! Manolo! Is zarzuela dead? Tell him, darling. Tell him how I had America at my feet. Tell us. Indescribable successes in Buenos Aires... Montevideo, Santiago, Chile... Rio deJaneiro, Caracas... In Mexico they wanted to carry me on their shoulders. I refused, of course. To avoid any groping, I guess. Really, Dad! No. He's right. You're an Othello. Of course. And proud of it. You're right, damn it. Will you tell them or not? Packed theaters, extended contracts... tons of flowers. Did you get rich? He did. Me, I'm an artist. Huge expenses. This French toast is delicious. It's wonderful. Have you learned to cook? Cook? them? Fernando cooked. He was in a seminary. Handsome, polite, helpful... The young man is a jewel. About time you had a proper friend. You're not a drinker, I hope. No, ma'am. Wonderful. Now, if you'll excuse me. The trip tired me out, and I'd like to rest awhile. See you later, love. I'll stay with Manolo. - The presents? - Later, when I unpack. Your daughter is selfish. It's just her age. A kiss, Violeta. Have a good rest. My poor little one. So young and... But I feel terrific, Mother! Now listen to me: Enjoy yourself. Life is short. Thank you for breakfast. It was delicious. Coming? No, not you. And me? Take a walk, get some fresh air... and enjoy nature. It's not fair. It's not fair! Mr. Danglard, don't be upset. I knew this would happen. How about some anisette? Why is he crying? Idiot! Can't you see he's Mother's lover? Don't go, Mr. Danglard. That'll make it worse. You're in such a hurry! Wait. I can't. I've been waiting for almost a year. Amalia. Christ, what a nuisance. What is it? Wouldn't it be better if you and I rested now? No. And if you make a scene, I'll leave you for Manolo. No, not that. Just give us a few minutes. Why do you torture yourself? You know we have forever. Really? I swear it. Now, go away. Don't be long. I feel sorry for him. I can understand him. But he should understand me too. Are you sure you'll be able? Will I be able? Will I or won't I? You're able, all right! And at your age! Who's he? - Mother's manager. - Great! Introduce me. Forget the introduction. Help us. Then introduce me later. I haven't forgiven you. We don't want Mother to know we broke up. Just so you know. Don't worry. And stop kissing me! Hey, Danglard. "A few minutes"? It's been four hours! And 47 minutes! You timed it? You're not a gentleman. You've no right to do this... to me! You'll get one. wait. More waiting? Poor Amalia is worn out. Let her sleep a little. He says that so happily! Your father has no shame! You're right, Mr. Danglard. Dad, the Republic has won! - It's definite? - It's official. The town's gone crazy! Let's go celebrate. Go, get the flag. I don't care about your Republic. What I want is an explanation. What explanation do you want? You're asking me? I'm wasting my fortune... to keep her happy and enable her to sing. Then, the American tour... A disaster. Why don't they forbid them once and for all? - Forbid what? - Zarsuelas. I've lost thousands. The worst part is that when my money's gone... your wife will leave me. She won't do that. Amalia really loves you. You think so? She told me. But then why does she... No, Danglard. If you weren't so blinded by passion... you'd see that I'm the cuckold. - You? - Of course! Maybe you're right. Except for you, Amalia was never unfaithful to me. Go and kiss her. She's a saint. But you don't deserve her, believe me. Giddap, Lucero. The king has only a paper crown Berenguer took away his gold one why did you throw him out? He tried to get in my bed! You did right. Because men, especially righteous men likeJuanito... once they've taken a girl's virginity... they forget about her. - You're still... - Of course! What about you, Violeta? May I? What a nuisance. What is it now? Nothing. I just want you to know I'm here. Fine. I know. Now will you let me enjoy my daughters? Of course. But you know that I'm here. If I met a man like Danglard I might consider it. He's eating out of your hand. Too bad your father wasn't like that. No, dear. Marriage isn't for you. You needn't put up with that. Men are all egotists. You should find a nice girl who understands you... and loves you and keeps house for you. Whereas you... Don't any men come into your shop? Sure they do. But they're old. Only old people have money. What will you do? Don't you know that once you're no longer pretty... They won't bother? And you? What do you say, my love? I'll kiss you to pieces. Nobody pays attention to me. They're all selfish. Didn't you realize? What? - Don't tell her! - She's in love! Be quiet! With whom? You'll all be sorry! With whom else? With Fernando! With the cook? Is it good? You like it? Better than Higinio's. Idiot! Be a little tactful. See? Always scolding me! What's wrong? Rocio says it's because Clara's husband drowned here. It's all right. Let me taste. It's delicious. Higinio's wasn't this good. Why is the child in such a state? She'll get over it. She's just spoiled. Here are the salad ingredients. Has Violeta caught anything? She's not back yet. I brought Mother along. She's turned Republican. I made this, since the Bourbon's gone. For red and yellow I used jams... but the purple is from beet root. Thank you on behalf of the Republic. Republic! what you'll get here is communism! Don't say that! It's true. I'm going back to Paris. Yes, and I could have my New York debut... my lifelong dream. With new sets and costumes, and an orchestra... with at least 90 musicians. But Amalia, that would be terribly expensive. Don't worry. You'll soon recoup it when they realize... that Broadway is a washout compared to the zarazuela. Does Dona Amalia sing in cabarets? Leave me alone! What did I do? Look, I'm worried about you. Luz... Leave me alone, you pig! Why? You're always on their side! Whose? Rocio's, Clara's and Violeta's. Since you don't like me... I don't like you? I've liked you since I first saw you. Then why are you always after those three? You think I'm blind? That's different. Really? well then go off with them! Don't you know it's you I love? - Me? - Yes, you, stupid! Then... What's going on? My poor baby! What are you looking at? They make a nice couple. First love... So pure, so chaste, so spiritual. You said spiritual? Jesus, Mary and Joseph! He's not to deflower her! Damn seminarian! - Are you crazy? - Just to scare them. And now... to get them married! But Luz... I have to be sure. About what? That you love me. You know I do. Yes. I don't want it to be like with them. Who? My sisters. With you it's different. That's what I want to be sure about. Come on. If you don't like me afterwards... you'll still have time to leave. I won't tell anyone what we did. Luz... I want you to do with me what you did with them. Manolo... What happened? Something awful. It's awful! What happened? Don Luis... God's punishment, Manolo! This is terrible! How could he hang himself? He loved to eat. "He who takes his own life... removes his fear of death." I think Shakespeare said that. Come on, let's go. How do I look? Lovely. Jesus, Mary and Joseph! What do we do now? Don't worry. Since Spain is now a secular Republic... consider yourselves married. Juanito, get theJustice to come and straighten it all out. Manolo's right. If you postpone the wedding, we'll miss the boat. We can't miss the boat. We're opening in Buenos Aires. But I won't get to sing "Ave Maria". I really wanted to do it. Give her a kiss. I'll be waiting for my first grandchild. Hurry up, it's leaving! Come on! Give me a kiss, Dad. Mother, write to us. Of course I will. And find yourself a husband. Yes, Mother. I wish you much happiness. Lots of happiness. Take good care of her, or your brother-in-law will fix you! And... I'll be the godfather. You idiot! Get on. It's leaving. Love brings pain, but you had a good time. You're such a rascal. Good-bye, Dad! "To leave is to die a little," the poet said. I think it's the reverse. The one who's left behind dies completely. Don't be silly. Give me a kiss. Have a good trip. Give me a hug, Danglard. As many as you want, my friend. A kiss. We're sorry to be leaving. Right, Fernando? Then don't go. Stay here. It's for Fernando's future. Yes, you're right. America is the land of opportunities. Get in the car. Remember what I said when... when you thought you were in love with Violeta? That you gained a son-in-law and lost a friend. Yes, that. I'll always be your friend. Go on, get in. Good-bye, Manolo. Giddap, Lucero.
