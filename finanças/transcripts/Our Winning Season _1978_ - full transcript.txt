See you later, Alice. - Okay. How does he do that? [ Mumbling ] Hear me? What? I want you to wear my pin. [ Sighs ] Oh, Jerry! Oh, Jerry! [ Both moaning ] [ School bell rings ] [ School bell rings ] Two bells. Mcduffy rides again! Yo, Dean, how's about letting me take care of your wheels while you're gone? Oh, that's great. Then I can sell it for salvage when I get back. - Hey, uh-- - shit! Hey, Dean, babe, so what do they teach in that basic-training stuff? Oh, it's not very interesting. What do you mean? I'd love to go over there and be a hero. [ Imitates machine gun, explosion ] Maybe you can take my place, Paul. Now tell him that thing, that song. They don't want to hear that. Yeah, come on, man.

I really wouldn't know. You don't mind, do you? I don't mind. It wouldn't really matter if I did mind, would it? Nope. That's what I thought. Hey, man, it's your birthday. What do you want to do? Want to go to the bowling alley? No, I don't want to go to the bowling alley on my birthday. Want to get laid?

"I thought a lot about David and the way he runs. His running out fast is all wrong. He wants the excuse of being burnt out so he really doesn't have to see what's in his guts at the end." Is that it? Yeah, for you. I think he may have something, David. Yeah, I think he may have something. - He's got a problem. - David! That's a pretty cheap shot. He wants you to win so you can get your ass in college and stay out of the army. Well, don't worry about it. I do. Well, don't. Good idea. - [ Paul clucking loudly ] - Aah! Come on, you guys! I just talked to Miller and Burton. We're on. - They went for it? - Oh, shit-- come on, guys, what's the matter with you? Come on! [ Clucks ] Come on, man, let's go! I don't like this, Jerry.

I could drink a six-pack right now. I could drink two. Let's go down to the store and see if somebody'll buy US something. - Let's get some. - I got something better. When did you start smoking? What's that? Oh, jeez, mcduffy! [ Gags, chuckles ] What are you doing, man? [ Inhaling ] Didn't you read "life" magazine? Don't you know what that stuff does to your chromosomes? Wakefield? [ Gags, laughs ] Smoke it, man. No, don't smoke it like a cigarette. Pull it down into your lungs and hold it. Wakefield, what are you doing, man? Jerry: Easy. There you go. I'm depraved enough. I don't need to get hooked on that stuff. You're crazy. You start doing that stuff and the next thing you know, you're-- doing that action. Didn't you see those films in gym class, man? [ Laughs ] - You smoke this stuff? - I tried it. - It's okay? - It seems okay. I don't feel anything. Okay. I'm doing this for you, Wakefield. Blah! [ Chuckles ] No, don't swallow it.

Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies. Thou annointest my head with oil, my cup runneth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the lord forever. Amen. All: Amen. The bergers wanted you to have it, ma'am.

David. Cath, what are you doing out here? I'm just sitting. How are you? I'm okay. You? You know what I thought of today? When we were kids we used to share the same room. Sure. "I am the spooky-wooky. Lend me your golden ears." Both: "I am the spooky-wooky. Lend me your golden ears." "I am the spooky-wooky. Both: I'll tickle your tinkle." I don't know why that scared me. You coming in soon? I think I'll just wait out here for a while, okay? I'll see you inside. "I am the spooky-wooky." [ Cathy chuckles ] [ Sighs ] Okay, 20,000 points on one ball. - You think I can do that? - Yeah. It's not fair, Dean getting knocked off his first week in the 'nam, you know? He never had a chance. Yeah, I know. What a waste. - Jerry: Hey. - Hey, Dave. How you doing, huh? Okay. You want a coke or something? - No thanks. - [ Pinball machine dinging ] How's Cathy? She's doing the best she can. Yeah, I know. I'm sorry. I'm so damn sorry! Whew. Hey, David, I don't think I got a chance to tell you-- I'm really sorry about what happened to Dean. Thanks, Burton. Aw, screw the clubs, will you, Miller? - It's time to grow up-- - hey, anytime, - anytime! - Grow up! Save it, save it, save it, all right? Just save it. Hey, Dean was a pretty good guy. Too bad he decided to go fight that crazy war. It was really stupid. You guys, sit down. Do you believe this? What did you mean? - When? - Just now, about it being stupid. I don't think it's really the time to talk about it. What did you mean? We shouldn't even be over there. Dean died for nothing. David: Son of a bitch! Paul: Hey, what are you doing? [ Clamoring ] [ All screaming, yelling ] Stop it! I've called the police! They're on their way. Get out of here! - Where's Dave? - I think he got out! Hey, David, are you all right? [ Siren wails ] Come on. - Stop, you kids! - Stop right there! What happened back there? I don't know. We just all went a little crazy. We could have killed somebody. David, what are you doing? You guys are in there beating up on each other and you gotta run tomorrow. It's probably the biggest day of your life. Think I don't know that? I want to win so bad it's killing me. I know you do. I want to win once. I want to know what it feels like. You will. I will? Sure. Just like that? Yeah. Just like that. I've been watching you all year. Oh, get out of here. I have. All right, you two, out of the back seat. Move it! Now! Paul: Rock 'n' roll! Let's go! [ Alice screams ] [ Paul laughing ] Shit. [ Window glass clinking ] Hey, how you doing? Okay. You all right? We're with you. Yeah. You're gonna take him, all right? You run your heart out. Yeah. Tomorrow, bro. Okay! Tomorrow. Sleep. Man on P.A.: ...With a jump from 25' has broken the old record... Coming up, the mile run. [ Tarzan yell ] Go Wakefield! Hi, cin. Listen, I gotta talk to you. Okay, talk. You got about a minute. Cindy, it's not the same anymore. I'm still hustling, but it's not working anymore. Aw, poor Jerry. You were the only one I cared about. You were the only one I gave a damn about. Jerry, are you being for real? Huh? Almost. Hey, you know that kid from carver? Yeah. Ran a 4:12 last time out. Yeah, I know. He's pretty fast. Yeah, he's the only guy I gotta worry about. Remember, Dave, get out fast and burn them out. Stay in front as long as you can. I'm looking for a record out of you today. You got it. - You're gonna need it. - Huh? A record. You're gonna need one to beat me today. Man on P.A.: The runners are now on the track for the mile race, the highlight event of today's state finals. And an excellent field. An oddity-- for the first time in the history of the spring meet, two men from the same high school have qualified for the finals. From Griffith high, David Wakefield and Burton fleishauer. I'm nervous. Fleishauer has the best time in the state this year, a 4:11, just a second off the state record. He's today's favorite. If not Burton fleishauer, experts figure Ken somes of carver, who has a 4:12 this year, will be the man... Come on, Dave, you can do it! - Come on, he hasn't even started running yet. - So? ...in Lane 1 is Burton fleishauer. Bill Robinson of San Fernando is in Lane 2. David Wakefield is in Lane 3. Ken somes of carver, Lane 4. Delaney of pious x in Lane 5. Morton of woodward in Lane 6. Benson of noonan in Lane 7. And Butler of Holly in Lane 8. It's a quarter-mile track-- four times around. Man: Runners, to your marks! Get set! And there they go! And it's a good start. Robinson is taking the lead. Run, Dave! David Wakefield is a close second as they head into the first turn. Come on, Burton! Move it! - Run, Dave! - Keep your pace, Dave! David Wakefield is now making a move and taking the lead as expected; Robinson in second, Wakefield the pacesetter in this race, the man the rest of the field looks to to put the field within a record time. Wakefield leads with Robinson second... [ Screams ] Let's go, David! 59, wow! Pick it up, Dave, pick it up! Move move move! ...59 seconds left. Let's go, David! ...leads the field here in the second lap. Robinson running four yards back in second, Morton two yards back in third. Wakefield with a 59 second flat in that first quarter continues to set a hard pace. One can only guess as to how long he can keep it up. 2:02! Push him, Dave, push him! An excellent time so far-- 2:02 for the half-mile. Let's move it! Let's move it! Wakefield continues to lead the field... Come on, let's go! ...Robinson is still second. Morton is third, everybody still very much in this race... Midway down the back stretch now and Robinson is taking over the lead... - What's the matter with Wakefield? - He's cramping up. Wakefield, the pacesetter, the rabbit, is dropping back, that pace apparently too tough to handle. The race favorites, are starting to move into contention... Robinson continues to lead... Hey, Burton, come on come on! David Wakefield and Burton fleishauer are running together in fourth... You know it! - Yeah, you got it! - Come on! Get out there, David! Somes is picking up the lead. Fleishauer to the outside is running second. Wakefield won't quit... Move it! Come on, get it! ...three-man race... Go! Go! [ Screams ] Come on, David! Fleishauer, Wakefield, Wakefield, fleishauer... Down to the wire-- Dave Wakefield! Oh my god! Yeah! [ Cheering continues ] All right! Whoo hoo! - All right! - We won! All right! My friend the champion! Oh, you did it! You did it! I'll be back in a minute.
