RIP-FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM Merry Christmas! Hi. - Hi, Haley. - Hi, Haley. - Hi. - Hi, Haley. - Hi. - Hey. - Kathy. - Excuse me. - Hey. - Hi. I just got your text about Tyler Toys. - Is this for real? - Yes. So I'm at Nail Bar and a few chairs down getting a pedicure is Tyler Toys' head of accounts. She takes a call while they're doing her cuticles and... They're looking for a new agency? Yup. Will you do the graphics? I'm in. I mean, when it comes to toy companies, they're kind of it. They're huge. I had every one of their Princess and Pony dolls when I was a kid. And Shauna said that if I brought in one more big client, she'd consider me for the senior account executive job. You so deserve it. But travel and hospitality is your thing. - I mean, toys? - I can do toys. And if you and I nail this, Shauna will finally see that I'm about more than just brand strategy. Are you sure more work is what you need? That reminds me, I have to cancel with Matt. Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait. That cute guy from your groove cycle class? Why? He sounded great. I have to take a deep dive into this research. No distractions until I get this promotion. I'm not sure we classify dating as a distraction. But whatever you say. I'm gonna go find Shauna. You have a minute? Only if you'll take these sweaters away. Creative left them here from the Toyland shoot and they're just a lot. A bold choice. So what do you need? Tyler Toys. They're looking for a new ad agency. Shauna, I wanna go after this account and be the point person on this pitch. Prove to you that I'm right for the senior AE job. They've approached us already. We're pitching to them in two weeks. The Friday before Christmas. That's great! I'm so on it. Haley, wait. I'm thinking about putting Tom on the pitch. What? No. Shauna, I can do this. Haley, there is no one better than you at delivering a fresh, hip brand strategy. But Tyler Toys built its empire on tradition and Christmas. I know. That's their Christmas doll from last year. They do only one every year. Kids go nuts for them. They want next year's Christmas campaign to feature classic Christmas traditions. I can do traditions. You've been spending every Christmas in the Caribbean. Working with our biggest resort client. But I take my parents, and we do Christmas stuff. - Like? - Like... Having a delicious, if not slightly untraditional, salmon Christmas dinner. Sometimes grouper, snorkeling. And watching Christmas movies in the hotel room. It was your turn to put up the Christmas tree this year. It was supposed to go up three weeks ago. I know. I'm sorry. I've just been so busy with work. Tom found the time to decorate the whole office. You just had the tree. Shauna, I can do this. Just tell me what I need to do. "Christmas Camp?" What? Is this a new account? It looks... rustic. No, I need you to go to Christmas Camp for a holiday attitude adjustment. You're kidding, right? My husband took us there a couple of years ago. It's about two hours west of Boston. The kids loved it and so did I, actually. It'll give you some inspiration for your pitch. Okay, so if I go to Christmas Camp, you'll let me pitch Tyler Toys? I'll look at campaign ideas from both you and Tom and the best one will pitch. And, here. Take one of these. You're going to need it. I'm just kidding. And that's terrible. This one, this one's cuter. Do that one. And don't forget to bring back the certificate. Good luck. A certificate? They actually have a certificate. Apparently so, and the only way for me to get one is to do all the activities, of which there are plenty. This sounds more like Christmas boot camp. Right? I just have to finish all these Christmas chores. And then I can focus on the Tyler Toys' pitch. But you don't do Christmas. I can do Christmas. I just never have time for all of the... Christmas cheer. I think it's the term you're looking for. - Where is this place, anyway? - It's a couple of hours upstate. - Do they have wine there? - Oh, gosh, I hope so. Okay, Christmas Camp. Let's do this. Aren't you just the happy little Christmas camper? Come in. - Hello. - Hi! You must be Haley Hanson. Welcome to Holly Peak, and Merry Christmas. - I'm Ben, the owner. - Thanks. I'm sorry I'm late. I had to stop by the office before I hit the road. I'm just glad you made it safely. The other guests are settling in, so you'll have plenty of time to unpack. - Great. - Hi, I'm Laura. Would you take some coco or a cookie? Sure, I'd love some. Thanks. That's one of our many traditions. Laura's father was our chef here for years. She took over the reins a couple of months ago when he retired. Well, nice to meet you, Laura. We're happy to have you. This is quite the Christmas collection. My wife, she collected decorations from every place we visited. And those homemade cards are all from former campers. This is Max. He's saying Merry Christmas. Well, Merry Christmas back at you, Max. You must be tired from your drive. - If I can show you to your room. - That would be lovely. - Thanks. - I got this. Give me that. - Thanks. - After you. So how was your ride up? It was easy. It's so beautiful up here. Yeah, I just love it here. This is heavenly. It's pretty special, isn't it? This is our angel room. Well, if there's anything else you need, just, just let me know. Thank you so much. - Hey, there he is. - Hey! What's up, pops? Well, let me get that for you. I don't want you to hurt your back. My back is just fine, son. - Thanks for coming, Jeff. - Good to see you, pop. It means a lot. I know how busy you are. Are you kidding? I wouldn't miss it. How's that waterfront project of yours going? Making progress. The condos are almost done. You know, I'm glad you found a way to save that old wharf. And a lot of the old brick, too. You know, there is a corner condo unit. It's, it's perfect for you, pops. You promised not to talk about this until after Christmas, right? It's just, the buyer that I found for the unit didn't wanna wait, pops. It's, it's a really good offer. Let's just get through Christmas Camp first, all right? Well, could you do me a favor? Run that up to the angel room. I forgot to give the checklist to our new guest. You got it. Hey, bub? - I'm glad you're here. - I am, too. Okay, for a second, I thought the dog could knock. Well, he's more of a scratcher, really. Here, I'm just making a stocking delivery. Thanks. So do you work for Ben? Let me guess. You teach reindeer grooming. Neither. I'm Jeff. I'm Ben's son. I help with the camp. And you are? Haley, from Boston. Well, welcome, Haley from Boston. And everything you need to know is gonna be in that checklist. - Right there. - Checklist? You can check off each theme once you've completed the day's activities. I have to do everything on this list to get my certificate? Well, that's the, kind of the general idea. We're gonna meet downstairs, six o'clock sharp. You're gonna love it. All right, well, see you later. - Okay. - Come on. Come on. - Who's a good boy? - Thanks. All of us are truly honored that you decided to choose this week to spend with us. Christmas Camp was my wife Libby's dream. And Libby, well, she loved Christmas more than anyone I've ever known. She used to love helping people remember what Christmas was all about. Spending time with family, friends and community. We lost Libby two years ago and we sure do miss her. So this week we're gonna be doing plenty of traditional Christmas activities. And hopefully, you can create some new traditions of your own. That's what we need. Well, why don't we start with you two? Ian, Susie. Well, we're newlyweds. Hi. I am an interior designer and Ian's in finance. This is our first Christmas as a married couple and we decided to invite both our families to our house this year. Yeah, so we're trying to figure out how to combine all our different traditions. - Our families are... different. - Yeah. My dad's a pro basketball coach and he, my mom, my brother and me, we just love basketball. We're happy with wings and beer for Christmases as long as we got the game on. Well, and my family is huge. We usually do a traditional Christmas in Maine and if my mom doesn't have the perfect turkey cooked just so, it's a huge deal. So we thought coming here might help us figure out how to merge. Well, I think you've come to the right place. I'm Gail and I'm here because this is my first Christmas without my son Ryan around. He's serving overseas in the military, and I just really miss him. We used to come here when Ryan was a little guy. And sending me here for camp was part of his Christmas gift to me this year. He thinks I've lost my Christmas mojo. Well, it seems like it was yesterday when you were, you were with your son Ryan, Gail. We'll see if we can get your Christmas mojo back. John, why don't you tell us about your family? Hi, everyone. I'm John. I'm a dentist. This is my son Blake and my daughter Madison. - Hi. - Hi. - Hi. - Hi. It's our first Christmas together since the divorce. Just the three of us. I wanted to make it special, so here we are. Sorry. I've to get this. But enough about work. How's Christmas Camp? It is all Christmas here 24/7. I better get back down there. Well, if nothing else, you should definitely be inspired. Right. Someone's at the door. I gotta go. Maybe it's Santa. Believe me, it totally could be. Coming! My dad sent me up to check on you. Sorry. It was work. I'm ready. Great. You might wanna bring your phone with you. Are you kidding? I sleep with this thing. Question. I was looking over all the activities. Is there any way I could, you know, speed up the process, get my certificate faster? You are really focused on this certificate. What's, what's the deal with that? Well, I was just wondering if I could get it without, you know, staying the whole week. I have this huge project at work and I have to prove to my boss that I completed the course load. So you came to Christmas Camp for work? That's a... that's a first. Well, well, it's not really about speeding things up around here. It's more about slowing things down. Come on. My dad will explain. Let's go. There she is. If you haven't met her yet, please say hello to Haley. - Hello! - Hey, Haley. - You're just in time. - For what? To meet Santa. It's called disconnecting to reconnect to Christmas. No, no, no, no. I really need my phone for work, so... I'm sure work can wait until the day's festivities are over. Can it? Can it, Jeff? - We had to give ours up, too. - Yup. - We all did. - Yeah, I kinda like it. Sometimes I feel like my phone owns me. Well, think of it this way. Your phone will be fully charged when today's festivities are over. Put it right there. For our next activity, I want everybody to write down your Christmas wish. I wish I had my phone. Me, too. And don't worry. No one's going to see it. It's just for you. - No Christmas wish? - I'm thinking about it. - You got one yet? - Always. It's a family tradition. So, Jeff, besides helping to kidnap people's phones, what is it that you do? I'm an architect, in Boston, as well. And I really wouldn't think about it as a kidnapping so much as a holiday for your phone. Whatever you need to call it. So you design buildings, homes? No, I specialize in restoration. I'm actually working on that condo that's down at the waterfront. - At Tanner's Wharf? - You know it? My parents met there, actually, at a dance at the Shore Club. They go back every year for their anniversary. No way. My mom, she used to teach dance here at Christmas Camp. She used to make me take her classes, which I hated at the time, but it's actually turned out to be quite useful. Well, your mom sounds like a pretty cool lady. Yeah, she was. Anyway, your, your parents, they are gonna absolutely love the restoration we're doing at the Shore Club. It's awesome. I'm really excited about it. They have this Victorian house that they're restoring right now. You have no idea. They love those home-restoration shows. You know, the thing about those shows is they always make those restorations seem a lot easier than they actually are. I know, I'm really worried. - They're in over their heads. - They probably are. How's it going on those Christmas wishes? - All done. - Great. If everyone's done, we can just put 'em in the basket by the Christmas tree. Finally. You went radio silent. I imagine you're being held hostage by disgruntled elves. We have to give up our phones until we're done with the day's activities. If you break the rules, do you, like, go to Christmas jail with, like, candy canes for bars? Very funny. You guys are working late. Tom's been holed up in his office all day, working on the pitch. He's got so many toys in there that it's starting to look like Santa's workshop. Okay, if I work nights, we can have something to present by the day, get back. That gives us one week to come up with something great. Has any inspiration struck yet? Nothing solid, but I'm working on it. Okay, well, send me your ideas as they come to you. You're going to get this promotion. - I miss you. - Miss you. Hey, Jeff. What are you doing? It's the drawer's come loose again. What's wrong? I've known you a long time. You always fix stuff when something's wrong. I'm okay, it's just every time I come up here, I always realize how much work this place is for my dad, and he won't even talk to me about selling the inn. It is hard work, but I think he really loves it. I think it comforts him carrying on something that was so important to your mom. Well, I just think he'd be a lot happier if he didn't have the stress of this business. We both know your dad can be set in his ways. Yeah. Jeff, for what it's worth... I can't imagine anyone being a better son than you've been to your parents. Well, thank you for saying that. I... I just wish I felt that way. Don't be so hard on yourself. Hey there. Looking for a good book? No, actually, I'm looking for some inspiration for a work project. Boy, you are so focused. You know there's a word for people that work too much. - Successful? - Not the word I was looking for. So what are you working on? Well, at the moment, currently I am a brand strategist. But I'm trying to show my boss that I'm capable of doing more. And if I get this account, then I'm up for a promotion. So what kind of projects you working on? In the beginning I represented mostly small mom-and-pop businesses. My first one was this tiny, little boutique hotel called the Sandpiper out on the Cape. I'm proud to say, they just opened their eighth location. Actually, it kind of reminds me of this place. That's so impressive. You made that happen? Don't get me wrong. I had a lot of help. That's what's so great about working in a big agency, right? There's someone who just knows everything about franchising, someone who knows how to make the perfect website. I kinda love it. What about you? Do you love being an architect? I love building people's homes, to give them a comfortable space... And having a sense of home is so important to me. So this research, what's it for? Are you building another hip hotel? Nope. It's for Tyler Toys. Their new campaign is all about Christmas tradition. Okay. So that's where the Christmas Camp comes in. - Exactly. - Okay. This should be a great book to start. This is great! - Thank you. - No problem. - Good luck. - Thanks. Can I help you? You're gonna wake everybody up. You've got a little snow on your face, buddy. You've got some snow on your face. So it looks like you found a new friend. - May I join you? - Sure. He wouldn't stop barking. I didn't want him to wake everyone up. That's his favorite trick when he wants a walk. Oh, really? I'm on to you now, buddy. Here, I can take him. Come on. Come here. Yeah, he's a good boy. He's a good boy. So, remember, we're meeting downstairs at 9 a.m. for our field trip. Where are we going, again? It's a surprise. Really? No hints? - Nothing? - Oh, come on. What's life without a little bit of mystery? It's not really how I look at things, but okay. That is just no good at all. Oh, no. Has everybody left already? Well, my dad runs this place like a train. They left at 9:01. I tried knocking on your door. I'm so sorry. I had my headphones on. I was so wrapped up in this proposal, I just lost track of time. I guess this whole disconnect to reconnect to Christmas thing isn't really pannin' out, huh? Just getting used to it, that's all. Well, you know, let's, let's try to meet up with everybody else. - Okay. - Come on. Where exactly are we going? We are on a mission to find the perfect Christmas tree. When you said we were going to get a Christmas tree, I thought we were gonna go to that little Christmas-tree farm we passed in town. It turns out you thought wrong. It's just a little farther. That's what you said ten minutes ago. I don't think we're gonna catch up to the rest at this point, but I know another great spot. Come on. Find your joy. My joy is someplace a little warmer, I guarantee you. This will do. It's beautiful. Hey, so everybody picks a tree for their room and then on Sunday when they leave, we donate them to the Community Center. Giving back has always been a big thing with my parents. That's really sweet. Well, which one do you like? That one. I want that one. Just needs a little love and some sparkly ornaments. Well, then, here you go. - I cut it down? - That's the idea. We hold the saw like this. All right. Now get a hold of the tree. I got this. Okay, then. All right. - Well... - I'll be taking this with me. Here we go. Let's, let's head home. - You know, it's cute. - Very cute. So as you all know, today's Christmas Camp theme's joy. Now you've already got your tree, so today we're going to decorate them. I love this, makes me think of how we used to sit around the tree, Christmas morning and open our gifts. No, see, we always did it on Christmas Eve 'cause my dad would have to travel when his team would play, so... Babe. Sometimes I think Christmas at your house was just another game day. No, I mean, don't get me wrong, we loved it. We just celebrated differently. Where's Gail? She went upstairs to her room. She said she was remembering how her son used to come here and decorate trees as a boy. Well... Yeah. Gail? I don't mean to bug you. I just wanted to make sure you were okay. Haley, hi. I'm coming right down. You know, my dad was in the air force, and I remember when he was away, and my mom would always pick out his favorite ornaments on the tree. Do you wanna tell me some of Ryan's favorite ornaments? Maybe you can help me carry on the tradition while we decorate. You really are a thoughtful girl, Haley. And maybe while we're decorating, you can tell me what's going on with you and that handsome Jeff. Don't be silly. There is nothing going on. Sure. Don't tell the other trees, but this one's always been my favorite. Mine, too, the family tree. Everyone decorate their trees? Everyone except Haley. Well, she's on it. She's up helping Gail. I think she's getting into the spirit of things. Your mom would like her. Who, Haley? She's just here to get her certificate. I think Haley's a go-getter. Besides, let's let Christmas Camp work its magic. Where do we put this? How about here? - Thank you so much for this. - You're welcome. I can't remember the last time I decorated a Christmas tree. It's so nice you brought ornaments from home to use. We should take a photo of it with my phone and send it to your son as soon as it gets released from phone prison. I mean, the charging station. I'd love that. Thank you. You're welcome. I figured he might've talked you into another walk. He likes you. - Do you have a dog? - No. I wish. I just travel so much for work, but I'd love a dog. Somehow I think it would make me feel better when my parents ever so subtly ask me if I'm dating anyone. I know what you mean. I think my dad asks me at least once a week if I've found anybody special. He's a hopeless romantic. He wants me to have the marriage that he and my mom had. Problem is, I don't seem to be very lucky in that department. You are preaching to the choir. The problem for me is, I think I just set the bar too high. It just makes me feel... a little guilty now that he's up here fending for himself. It's none of my business, but your dad seems like he's doing great, like he loves what he does. Yeah, well, I think he puts on a good front, but... They were high-school sweethearts. They were married for 40 years. I can't imagine what he must be going through. It's chilly out here, huh? Here. I can't have you freezing out here tonight. - There you go. - Thanks. Your dad. I can tell how much you care about him. It's nice. Well, thank you for saying that. Thank you so much for that book recommendation. I'm gonna go inside and check it out and see if some inspiration hits. Thank you. Goodnight, Max. I'll see you in the morning. Goodnight. Hey, where'd you guys go? Got you, dad! - Gotcha! - You're both going down! Shall we? - Let's do it. - Yeah! There'll be a payback, too. Take it, kid. Here you go! I'm gonna get you. - Oh, yeah? - Come on! All right, everyone, it's time to head into town and help out at the Community Center. As you know, today's theme is giving back. Yeah, that'd be good. There we go! Yeah! I'm coming. So did you send that picture of the tree to your son? I did. I haven't heard back from him, though. We've been trying to video chat lately, but it's been tough with his schedule. You ladies are fast. This looks great. Jeff, could you trade with me for a sec? I think we need some more pies. - So do you do this every year? - We do. I mean, all said and done, we, I think we fed about 500 families last year. I gotta step up my giving game. I wanna show you something. No. I'm not encouraging you to work during camp, but I think this might give you some inspiration for your campaign. Come on. Okay. This is an Angel Tree. See? Kids get to make their Christmas wish and we get to help their parents make that wish come true. Pick one. You know what? I think there's something here. What if Tyler Toys surprised every kid on this tree with a toy? I mean, they could do it nationally. You know, I've actually bought a Tyler Toy Christmas doll from a wish on this tree before. They're all about giving. This could be the big idea they're looking for. - Yeah. - Thank you, Jeff. You're welcome. To the Tyler Toy giving-back campaign. Yeah. Tink. I was gonna stop by that cute gift shop in town. - You wanna come along? - Sure. I wanna pick up a couple of things, too. Hey. Thank you. We should go to lunch after this. Yeah. You know what, I wanna go in this store. - It's so cute in here. - Adorable. You looking for anything special? It's for a six-year-old girl named Tonia who wants a My Little Puppy doll. And there's one more thing on my list. You and Jeff sure are cute together. I'm just saying. Okay, I'll admit it. He's cute and sweet. But I can't let myself get distracted. You know, I've too much at stake at work. There'll always be a work deadline. But for the right guy? That's a distraction worth having. Working on your laptop? Well, knock me over with a feather. Hey, the ideas are finally starting to flow. I have you to thank for that inspiration. Well, hey, I know you're anxious to knock some of these things off your list, so if you want, I have a fun idea to help you get a jump on that spirit section. What exactly did you have in mind? I can't believe I'm doing this. I haven't done this since I was a kid. It's great, right? Besides, if you're gonna start comin' up with ideas for a toy company, I mean, you gotta start thinkin' like a kid. Are you sure you don't secretly work in advertising? Okay. Now. - You ready for the secret? - Yes. You have to get up without wrecking your angel. That's a lot of pressure. Are you ready? - Okay. - One, two, three. Lookin' pretty good. That was fun. I should get back inside. Yeah, you know, we have our one-on-one activities tomorrow, but afterwards, if... if you're not busy, maybe we can have like a, like a hot-cocoa break or something. 11 a.m. - I'd like that. - Yeah? So it's a date? I'll see you at 11:00. Yeah, I'll see you at 11:00. I knew I smelled cookies. It's a Holly Peak family recipe. Here. You ready for today's activity? Yes. You gotta be kidding me. Glad you liked them because today we have to make lots more of them for the Community Center Dance. We make cookies for them every year. Okay, but I'm warning you, I don't cook. Good to know, because this is baking. I can't believe it. These actually look pretty good. Everyone burns a batch once in a while. Or three. But look at how much you've improved. And they're good. Well, I couldn't have done it without you. Okay, well, I think these are all set. I'm gonna text my mom a picture. You won't tell, will you? Your secret's safe with me. - When did this happen? - This morning. Their VP just called and asked to hear pitches on Monday, four days ahead of schedule. Shauna just sent an e-mail. Tell me one more time about that angel idea. Okay, here's the pitch. And when she gets up, it's a perfect angel on the snow. - Can definitely run with that. - Cool. Send me the proofs. - I'll look 'em over tonight. - Will do. I gotta go. Hey, it's Jeff. Come in. Hi. I'm sorry. I thought I heard some voices in here. - Are you alone? - Yeah. No, just me. Did you forget about our hot-cocoa break? No, I just needed to grab something after making those cookies. Let's get that cocoa. I think your angel's ringing. Let's get back to the group. Yeah? Shall we? It was a work emergency. You can check the text if you want. It says 9-1-1. I'm putting it back on the charger right now. Haley, you don't owe me an explanation, all right? You're a paying guest. You know, I just was really looking forward to spending some time with you and I was hoping that you were, too. I was. I am. Really. It's just, I didn't want you to think I was a workaholic. No judgement. You have your priorities. I just have some stuff to get to in the kitchen, so... Great. That's just great. At least you still like me. Okay, okay, so, Don, Brenda and the kids stay in the upstairs guest bedroom here, while Joyce and Grant can crash the pullout, right? Oh, no, wait, that won't work because that puts Travis and Jenn in the bonus room. Oh, right. Wait, aren't Travis and Jenn the Snowmen? Having your family is hard. Good morning. Hey, kids, why don't you leave Susie and Ian alone? But we're trying to help them figure out where everyone will sleep. Travis and Jenn can't sleep on the blowup mattress because of Travis' back. Jonathan and Annette need enough space for a pack and play. They had it all figured out until Ty and Bekah decided to come in last minutes. Well, Susie said Ty's too cheap to buy a hotel. Having your family is hard. Does this work? I think you solved it! Good job. Okay, what's going on? I don't want you to lose this offer by waiting till after the holidays. Jeff... I'm not sure I'm ready to sell or even want to sell. Dad, we've talked about this. We've gone over the books twice. The numbers, they don't add up. What if something goes wrong? Right now we need to focus that everyone has a great time this week. Okay. Hey, if you don't mind, I'm gonna run back to the city and check on the building site... I'll be back first thing in the morning. - Call me if you need anything. - Drive safe, son. Hey, Haley. Can I join you and your new friend? I'd love it, actually. Libby used to come out here when she needed a good think. Then she'd send me out here, too, when she thought I needed one. I think it's so pretty up here. You know you remind me a lot of myself? We both love our jobs. I love working the camp. It gives me a purpose. It validates me. You know what I mean? Yup. Sometimes I think I get too much validation from the office. Being here has kind of shined a light on that. And Jeff, I think he's more like his mother was. She made sure that we had date night. Every Friday we would get unplugged. I think that Jeff worries that this place is too much for me now. What he doesn't realize is that what really scares me is the idea of not doing this. - Have you said that to him? - Not exactly. I don't know. Maybe I should sell the inn and move in closer to him. Is that what you want? No, I love it here. But we're losing money. Wait, but I thought you sell out every Christmas. Yeah, well, the camp does well at Christmas, but the inn can get kind of lean the rest of the year. My hotel client had a seasonal problem, too, until my boss suggested that they franchise. To take a great idea that people love and give it to a wider audience. - How did that go? - Well... They just opened their eighth lo... Wait. Why couldn't you do that? Why couldn't you just franchise Christmas Camp to existing inns as a way for them to have an additional revenue stream? How would that work? Well, I still have all the contacts from the Sandpiper properties. You would be the expert Christmas consultant and show other resorts how to do your Christmas Camp and get a percentage of the profits from each place. You know how to do this? Well, the first time was difficult, don't get me wrong. But I work at a big agency and there's a whole division dedicated to hospitality. I'd love to get their input and just take what I've learned and... help. Well, Jeff, he has a, he has a buyer for the inn, but I told him to hold off until after Christmas. Well, I can have my office run the numbers. I'll put together a quick proposal. It's just an e-mail. Well, I'd love to see your proposal. That sounds exciting. Thank you. And, well, let's just keep this franchise stuff between us for now. - You're not gonna tell Jeff? - No, no. I'll tell him. It's just, I need to find the right way to approach him. Okay. Hey. I'm sorry I missed our hot-cocoa date. See, I'm the one that overreacted. And I know that we both have a lot on our plates and neither of us were looking for any distractions. - Thanks for understanding. - Of course. All right, everybody. Who is ready to pitch their Christmas spirit? We call this "Practice your pitch, Christmas edition." Now, each one of these targets represents one of the tenets of Christmas Camp. And the goal is to take a snowball, hit the target, then tell us how this affected you this week. So let's see... "Spirit." Well, I guess, watching you decorate the trees has put me in the Christmas spirit. All right. Ian, why don't you go? All right. "Love." When I saw Susie reading "Basketball For Dummies" on her iPad last night before bed, it just, it just made me love her even more. Well, when you fell asleep watching videos about how to baste the perfect turkey, I figured I should step up my game. All right, Haley, you're up. Well, I came to Christmas Camp for inspiration and I kind of feel inspired to slow down and disconnect. - Well, that's a good one. - That's a good one. Atta girl. Yeah! I see you've been hiding that pitching arm. - You got an arm like a rocket. - My dad does love baseball. So I guess I must've picked up a couple of things. Any chance you wanna go for a walk before we head back in? I do feel legitimately terrible for missing our cocoa date. Sure. We're actually near one of my favorite spots. How did you find this place? The locals call this Star Peak because it is a great place to see the stars at night. I bet it is. And here is where my dad proposed to my mom. Really? They'd come up here every year after that and drop a coin in the well and make their Christmas wish together. Would you believe I've never actually made a wish in a wishing well? Well, my dad, he told me that the secret was you have to actually believe that your wish is gonna come true. You believe that kind of stuff? I'm starting to. I'm starting to believe in a lot of things. - You ready? - Yeah. So are you spending Christmas with your parents this year? I am, I take them to the Caribbean every year. I have a client there, so I can see them and work. It's a win-win. Well, is that what they wanna do? Yeah, I mean, they've never said they didn't wanna do that. It's the Caribbean. What's not to like? You wanna head back? Sure. Sit. Good boy. Good boy. - Hi, mom! - Hi, sweetie. Everything okay? Well, we had some pipes freeze here last night and they burst. So it's a... It's a bit of a mess. Who was that plumber? Remember your friend from high school? Your dad thinks he can fix this himself and I think that's a terrible idea. Michael? He's in Hawaii with his family for Christmas. Let me ask my friend up here. He might have some ideas. Really? That would be great. Thank you so much. Well, today's theme is doing something for someone you love, so you just got me another check on the checklist. I'm sorry, your checklist? It's a Christmas Camp thing. Mom, do you like going to the Caribbean for Christmas? Well, we like being with you. And since you work through most holidays, at least we're all together, right? Well, what would you guys like to do? I don't know. Gosh. Maybe something a little more homey? I think your dad and I might prefer turkey to seafood if I'm being totally honest. How have I never asked you this before? Well, you know I love you and dad very much, right? Of course, I know that, sweetie. We love you, too. All right. I'll talk to you later. Bye. This is my mom's phone number. - I cannot thank you enough. - Yeah, well, you know... I'll give her a call later and see if I can help. Hey, Laura, you wanna tell everyone about tomorrow's plans? Yeah, well, as we all know, Christmas is a time where we get together with family and friends to share a meal, but it's actually food that makes up such an important part of our tradition, so... So I'd like all of you to help Laura put together a special Christmas meal for tomorrow night. It's our last dinner. So, Madison and Blake, what are some of your favorite foods to eat at Christmas? Madison loves pumpkin pie. She has since she was little. Yeah, I've kind of moved on from that, dad. I'm all about Brussel sprouts or bacon bits these days. So grown up of you. I love the mashed sweet potatoes. Okay, you both totally got that from me. I love both those things, thank you. Awesome, guys. Anyone else? It's not food, but my family has this tradition where we go around the table and each family member says what it is that they're grateful for. Then we'll do the around- the-table I'm-grateful-for thing if we can have buffalo wings as an appetizer. - I can live with that. - Yes. Wings and gratitude. You got it. Anyone else? My dad used to brine the turkey and it was so good, I couldn't wait to eat it. One brined turkey. Haley, what about you? Well, I haven't had a normal Christmas dinner in a while, but when I was a kid, I loved my mom's stuffing. It had sausage and sage and a lot of gravy. Yes. Well, it sounds like we have our Christmas menu. Thanks, guys. I've got a draft of the proposal. Let me know if you want me to walk you through it. We were just there. Jeff took you to the well? Yeah. Why? Is that strange? No, it's just that, I've never known him to take anyone there. Okay, so I've outlined an action plan. I talked to a guy in Legal at my office about timelines for franchises, and he seems to think it's entirely possible we could have something in place by next Christmas. Really? - When did you do all this work? - What can I say? I was inspired by the idea. And once I got started, I couldn't stop. Hey there. What are you two talking about? Going over some Christmas Camp ideas. Well, we know there's only one more day. - What's this? - Open it. We just got some pictures back from the waterfront condos. Well, this could be some of your best work. And the corner condo is still available. I thought maybe after camp's over, we could take a walk together, go check it out. It's got a great gym and a pool and it's only a mile from my house. I know. I know. I'll talk about it with you in the morning. Yeah. Today's theme is inspiration. So I want you to think about someone or something that's inspired you this past week. And just a reminder that after dinner tonight is our camp graduation party. It's gonna be fun. We invite the whole town. All right. Well, I have my inspiration. Being here has reminded me how special this place and this holiday are. We used to have a little tradition of having friends over the Friday before Christmas for an open house and I'm gonna reinstate it this year. And if any of you are around, I hope you'll come. - Yes! Absolutely! We'd love to. - Of course. That sounds great. Something smells great. Do you need any help? I would love some. Here. It's eggnog French toast. Would you just put these on a plate for me? - I'll be right back. - Yeah, sure. From cookies to breakfast. I am impressed. I'm having fun helping Laura out. Very nice. Also, by the way... I have my best man helping your parents out, so if they need anything else, please don't hesitate. That is incredibly sweet of you. Well, hey, well, I don't know if you noticed, but this place is about paying it forward. Well, in that case, try this. Is that eggnog? You're good. I didn't make it. You guys. - You want a croissant? - Yeah. Thanks. They are definitely gonna miss the meals here. I think what they like most is spending time with their dad. Do you think you could teach me how to make Brussel sprouts and sweet potatoes? - I would love to. - Thank you. Can I have French toast? - Duty calls. - Yeah. So as you all know, our projects today are about inspiration. So who wants to go first? Madison. So my mom wanted to take us skiing for the New Year, and I was scared to try. But I had so much fun this week playing in the snow, meeting all of you that I was inspired to text my mom and tell her that I wanted to try skiing. Blake? Well, it turns out that actually having a snowball fight is way more fun than watching other people do it on the Internet. So I'm inspired to play more in real life. All right! John. I was thinking about our time at the Community Center and decided to implement volunteer time at my practice. That's what I like to hear. - We actually did ours together. - Yeah. Spending time with all of you this week has inspired us to share some exciting news of our own. We're expecting! - Yeah. - Hey! All right! - Well, congratulations. - Congrats. Okay. So this is a picture of my parents' house. Being here with all of you has made me realize what home for the holidays can actually mean. And it inspired me to ask my mom if they wouldn't mind staying home for Christmas this year. Yay, yay! Thanks for coming with me to pick up the donations at the firehouse. Of course. Thanks again for helping my parents. They're super excited about having Christmas at their place this year. It was easy. I'm glad I could help. Well, I always thought they loved the Caribbean, but turns out they're looking forward to having a traditional Christmas. Like snow angels? I don't know about that. I'm just hoping that we don't have anymore pipes burst. Well, if you do, give me a call. I do work for cocoa. Thanks. Christmas sounds so relaxing and far off. All I can think about is the Tyler Toys' pitch. It's the day after tomorrow. Is that all you can think about? I have some other stuff on my mind. Yeah. Mine, too. I'm so sorry. Well, it's later than I thought. Yeah, yeah, we should, we should probably get the donations. What? What is it? It's nothing, I've just been thinking. If my dad would just accept this offer for the inn... well, then this would turn out to be a really great week. Wanna go get those donations? Okay. Okay, I think that's it, I say we print it and I'll walk Shauna through the details. Will do. Have fun at your party. We're gonna land this account. Come in. I'm so excited about tonight. Would you mind zipping me up, please? Of course. And I have the perfect bracelet for this dress. I love it. You know, there's something about this place. I haven't even considered dating since Ryan's dad passed, but seeing you and Jeff together might've inspired me to consider it. You know, I'm gonna download a dating app on my phone when I get it back tonight. I think that's great. You look so beautiful. Thanks, Haley. Laura, you have outdone yourself. Everything looks great. I aim to please. Let's hear it for Laura! And today we're gonna start a new tradition for Susie and Ian. I'd like everyone to go around the table and tell us what they're grateful for. Madison, why don't we start with you? I'm grateful for my phone. And that I got to hang out with dad. I'm grateful that we got to hang out with dad, too. He's pretty cool. And for my sister. Even though she snores. Well, I'm grateful for my kids. I love you guys more than anything. - Love you more. - Great. For my son Ryan, who I'm proud of every single day. I'm grateful for patience and compromise. I am grateful, first and foremost, for you and I'm grateful for our newest addition. I'm grateful for meeting each and every one of you and for all of the possibilities that are opening up for me. Well, on behalf of Jeff, Laura and I, I'd like to thank all of you wonderful people for joining us at Christmas Camp. I know that Libby's heart would be full if she saw and heard everything around the table tonight. Merry Christmas, everyone. Merry Christmas. Now let's eat and get this graduation party started. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. So those dance lessons your mom made you take? Smart woman. - You think so? - I do. Did you find the gift ornaments? We need to talk. Let's go into the library. Christmas Camp franchise? - You can barely handle one. - Just hold on a second, son. I can handle this place just fine. Do I miss your mom? Every moment of every day. But moving into a condo in the city isn't going to change that. Why didn't you just tell me about your plans to expand? Well, that part is new. But I tried to tell you. I don't want to give this place up. I'm not ready to retire. I love changing people's lives for the better. I love bringing smiles to people's faces, bringing families back together. It keeps me young. But mom wanted me to take care of you. She wanted me near you. Your mom would want me to be happy. She would want us both to be happy. And, Haley, what... He's your client? - Jeff, please let me explain. - So this all... This was just some research trip so you could, what, copy the format? - No. - No, it's not like that. That's not what it looks like from this proposal. I just wish you two would've been honest with me. It's my fault. This was all about work. No, it's not like that. I promise. Just... I was just trying to help. And I asked her not to tell you. No, I gotta get out of here. I'm gonna go back to the city. Will you please just tell everybody I said goodbye? Jeff, wait. Please let me explain. Well, just let him cool down. I'm so sorry, Ben. I never should've written that proposal. I don't know what I was thinking. No, it was my fault. I was the one who wanted to wait to tell him. He thinks it was all about work. I mean, it was, at first, but not anymore. Haley, I don't know how much Jeff has told you. His last girlfriend, I mean, she was a nice girl, but they just didn't fit. And Jeff couldn't admit that to himself. So when they broke up, he was heartbroken. I think... what he's feeling for you right now... scares him. I just never meant for any of this to happen. Is Jeff coming back? I hate that we don't get to say goodbye. He had to rush back to the city. I'm sure he'll be upset that he missed you, though. - You're leaving, too? - Oh, no. We were just gonna take our Christmas trees to the Community Center. Time to get back to the real world. Are you sure you don't mind taking my tree, too? - Not at all. - Thanks. I loved meeting all of you. Don't forget. My house, the Friday before Christmas. - I'll text you the address. - Okay. Thank you so much. Thank you. - Congratulations. - Thank you so much. Drive safe. Great to see you. Merry Christmas. Tell the kids I said Merry Christmas. - Okay? - I sure will. I'll miss you, too, Max. Wait... Don't forget this. Thanks. Just give it some time. Okay. Bye. What's this? - Hi. - Hi. You wanted to see me? They called this morning to say we got it! They said your take on granting the Christmas wishes of kids around the country captured the spirit of what makes their brand special. The kids, the angels, the tree... It was everything they were looking for. It was all real, I was just trying to convey how I felt last week at Holly Peak. That whole spirit of sharing brings me to my next question. What is it? I'd like to bring Tom in to help run this account. - Would that be okay with you? - Are you sure? Positive. It's gonna be a two-person job. I think that's a great idea. And I'd like to have some time for my other new account. Which reminds me. Here you go. The certificate. Haley, what made you decide to partner with Tom on the account? Christmas Camp. When I was there, I realized I'd spent so much time rushing to get ahead in my career and I'd missed out on so many important things, my family, love. Tom seems to have a handle on that. Who knows, maybe I'll learn something from him. - Congratulations. - On the certificate? No, someone who recognizes teamwork, demonstrates great leadership skills and makes a good campaign even better is exactly what I'm looking for in a senior account executive. The job is yours if you want it. Wait, really? I got it? Yeah. You earned it. Merry Christmas, Haley. Thank you. I won't let you down. Congratulations. You so deserve it. Nice tree. This is for you. Wait. You usually give me a gift card, unwrapped. I thought we could start a new tradition. It's for all that help while I was away. I couldn't have done it without you. I love it. Thank you. Have you heard from him, the owner's son? Nope. Not a peep. Haley, someone from the Holly Peak Inn is here to see you. Tom, wait up a second. Hi. It's so good to see you. Well, you should have told me you were coming into the city. - Everything okay? - Everything's great. That's why I'm here. - We need to celebrate. - Celebrate, why? I reached out to some inns out on the Cape and... Well, I gave them the pitch that we rehearsed, sent them your proposal and all three got back to me and they're all in. That's so great. Yeah, it's like an early Christmas present. So I thought that, well, maybe we could go to Gail's party and celebrate. Oh, Ben. I don't know if I'm up for seeing everyone. Now, come on. It wouldn't be the same without you. Besides, there's a little surprise in store you're not gonna wanna miss. Okay. Let me get my coat. There you go. Merry Christmas! Hi! - How's your son? - He's fine. We haven't gotten it together for video chats the last couple of days, but as long as he's okay, that's all I need. There are people in here that wanna see you. Okay. Hi! - Merry Christmas! - Merry Christmas! - Ben... - Welcome. I can't believe everybody made it. I wouldn't miss it. Who doesn't love a Christmas party? - Where are Blake and Madison? - They're with their mom tonight. They sent their love. - And you! - Hi! I wouldn't have missed it for the world. - This is my husband Jake. - Hi. - Hi, nice to meet you. - Haley. Hey, I hear you're helping Ben expand his Christmas Camp to other resorts. That is so fantastic. There's the door. Come on. Oh, Ryan! Hi, mom. I got approved for leave and I had to come surprise you. Well... Ben helped. I couldn't have pulled this off without him. - Come in. - All right. Hi. Can we talk outside? I am so sorry for the way that I acted and how I left. I've been trying to find a way to reach out all week. No, I'm sorry, too. I never meant to keep anything from you. You were trying to help my dad. I couldn't hear how much he didn't wanna sell that inn. I totally get it. You were just trying to look out for him. But you've got to know, our week together wasn't about work. Dad explained everything. And he showed me the card that you left him with the present. "Ben, thank you for helping me rediscover what Christmas is really about. This week has opened my heart. Love, Haley." You opened my heart, too, this week, Haley. And I wasn't expecting it, but I'm so glad that you did. Merry Christmas, Haley. Merry Christmas. You wanna go inside? Come on. - Hi! - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas, everyone. - Merry Christmas! RIP-FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM
