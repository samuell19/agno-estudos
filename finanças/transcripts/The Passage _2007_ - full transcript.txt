My name is Amy Bellafonte. I didn't used to believe in monsters, but I do now. I saw them change everything. It didn't start with me. It started with two lifelong friends who wanted to make the world a better place. This is crazy, pal. I mean, how many days we been walking now? I still can't believe I gave that punk my watch. Suits him. Elevates his status. I don't think he knows where he's going. I think we're close. I think we're lost. Yo! We almost there yet? Hey, Fanning, he still doesn't speak English. Maybe we can't find your guy 'cause he doesn't exist. You know, if it's true, we change the world. You skeptical, Richards? Of your magical 250-year-old man? Who cares what I think? The DoD and the CDC believe in you, Lear, so here we are. He says your guy's in that cave. This is as far as he'll take us. Careful. Eyes up. My God. It's him. Why the hell is he in a cage? What's that kid doing? Is he sick? Hey, Tim. Tim, no. Hey, what's going on? Is he sick? What's he saying? Jararaca. Vampire. Hey, we're doctors. We can help. Is he sick? Fanning, get away from the cage! - Tim! - Take him down! Aim for his head! - He won't stay down! - Hey! Move, move! Tim! Tim. No. Dr. Lear thought his friend was dead. Jonas. But death would've been better. My God. Tim. You're alive. Your neck. How is this possible? I don't know. But I feel amazing, Jonas. I think we found what we're looking for. We're going to change the world. You're bleeding. I am? What they discovered in that cave set everything in motion. Project Noah was born. Just what the hell is Project Noah anyway? What, you boys building some type of ark? That him? Mr. Carter, we represent a government medical organization called Project Noah. We're on the verge of an exciting breakthrough that can improve the lives of all Americans. A drug that makes people immune to disease. Infectious diseases like AIDS, Ebola, SARS. What does this have to do with me? In exchange for commuting your execution, you have the opportunity to take part in a drug trial. You won't be the first, either. Martin Echols, John Baffes, a young lady named Shauna Babcock, all people who were facing execution, and now they're in Colorado, enjoying the scenery. Are any of those people you just mentioned available to speak about their experience at Project Noah? You're a murderer on death row. It doesn't look to me like you have that many options. This is a take it or leave it deal. How about I leave it, then? Anthony, of course you have a choice. And, yes, this is unusual. But you're gonna be executed. That's gonna be the end of your story. What I'm offering you instead is time. I can give you an ocean of time. So many things led to what happened. It was the perfect storm. Listen up. I just got off the phone with the CDC and the Department of Defense. The Chinese avian flu has gone from outbreak to epidemic. Now, our intelligence has put the death toll at 15,000. It's airborne, it mutates fast, and there's no vaccine. What's the incubation period? 12 hours. You get exposed at breakfast, you're dead by dinner. We're looking at a global pandemic. How long until that hits the U.S.? Three months, if they can't contain it. But the CDC think the work we're doing is our best hope for a vaccine. Well, we haven't brought a subject safely through trial. I mean, we're nowhere near ready. I'm aware of that, Dr. Lear. So, how do we get ready? We could try incubating in mammalian vero cells. No, that would take too long. You need extended passaging with antitryptic activity. I got something. Nobody's gonna like it, though. Yeah, well, I have a very open mind right now. Let's go down to the cells. It'll be easier to explain there. Tim Fanning. Patient zero. He was 52 when he was infected in Bolivia three years ago. The exposure threw his immune system into hyperdrive. But after a short period of accelerated healing, he declined into this. He's immune to disease, but he's also a lethal bloodsucking monster, who we are all very careful not to call a vampire. Is there a point to this recap? Setting the table. Stay with me. Then came the murderers John Baffes, Victor Chavez, Kathy Turrell, Rupert Sosa. We attenuated the formula with each subject. Each one had a longer period of good health before the decline, with less side effects. Still lethal and ugly as hell, but we're getting close. Echols, Martinez. June Reinhardt, the white supremacist. She was delightful. Then we get to Shauna Babcock. Subject 11. The best result yet. She took 28 days to decline. And when she did, her vital signs and appearance remained human. We exposed her to Ebola, HIV, measles. She's immune to all of it. And she can still rip your head off and drink you like a Jamba Juice. Well, yes, okay. Nobody's perfect. But we're making progress. It's not just tweaks to the formula, it's age. The formula attacks neurons. Younger people have more neurons. The more neurons, the less severe the decline. How old is Anthony Carter? He's 25. Arrives tomorrow. We should move forward with him, but he's not young enough. Don't even say it. Are you suggesting we try with a child? Yes. Children have billions more neurons than adults. A child would come through with zero side effects. You wanted a solution. This is it. How far did you go? Six miles, maybe. How'd you know where I was? I know where everybody is. It's my job. You okay? I spent all day trying to punch holes in Pet's research. But it holds up. I think he's right. I can't believe I'm saying this, but how feasible is it to find a child? Can you live with this? No. It's hideous. But it's either I live with it or millions of people die. Can you find a child? Can you do that? Yeah. I can do it. Just a matter of finding a kid with no family, no paper trail with social services. Someone no one will miss. Come on! You got it! You got it! You got it! You got it! You got it! You got it! You gonna let a girl beat your ass? Not trying to make you sad, but I think it's time for you to lose. Damn. Here, have it. You won. I mean, I had plans for that money, but whatever. We got to go. Where'd you move here from? Georgia. Before that, Baton Rouge. Want to come to our house for dinner? My mom won't care. No, I got to get home, too. My mom'll get mad if I miss dinner. Did you shut down the fryers? No, let's do that right now. We're closing. You got someplace to go? Your mama doesn't mind you running around so late? No, ma'am. She works nights. I think I'm all good. Thanks. Copy that, 1-6. Switching over now. A 32-year-old female pronounced dead on the scene of an apparent drug overdose. Mommy! I was ten years old the night my mama died. No! Mommy! Mommy! That's my mom! She doesn't have any people? She said no. Poor thing. Just her mama. But you go on. It's too late to get social services. We'll put her in temp foster for the weekend. Paperwork can wait till Monday. I'm the girl from nowhere. Honey, I need to take your picture, please. The one no one will miss. Come on, sweetie. That's why they chose me. My name is Amy Bellafonte. This is how the world ends. - What is this place? - Used to be a hotel. That's not what I'm asking. We'll take it from here, Agent. Mr. Carter, welcome. We'll show you to your quarters. You ever wonder what happens to these homicidal maniacs once they get in that elevator? I don't think about it. - Brad. - Hey, brother. - How you doing, bro? - Good to see you. How's things? Thanks for the, quick turnaround on Anthony Carter. Thank him. The guy can sell a glass of water to a drowning man. He's a good talker. Got us out of a lot of jams back in the day. That's right, you guys served together. It was like, special ops, right? Three tours. Taught me everything I know. Do not piss him off. He's dangerous. Got another job for you. This one's a little different. No problem. - It's not yours! - It's mine now, bitch! - Give me my book! - Whoa! -Come on, big girl, get up. - You know it's mine, you hooker! - Get up! - That's right, get her! Yeah! - Amy, get up off that ground. Some man here to see you. Come on. Aw, damn! Here she is. Amy Bellafort. Bellafonte. My name is Bellafonte. I'm Agent Doyle. This is... Brad Wolgast. Hello, Amy. We understand your mother died. We're very sorry for your loss. We have reason to believe that she may have been exposed to a disease. My mom died of an overdose. We think she was exposed to a toxin. The CDC wants you to see a specialist in Colorado. How come there's no social worker? And how come they didn't send a lady? They always send a lady. I don't know. They just sent us. We'll have to do. Amy, pack up and go with these men. Move it. Let's go. Hey, so, can I get reimbursed for her meals? I don't get free food just because I'm a good person. Seriously? Hey, give that back! She's making a break for it. Come on! - Help! - You're okay. - No! He-Help! - It's okay. Help! Get your hands off that girl! Where you going with her? No! No, please... Drive. Drive! What are you doing? Why are we stopping? Aah! What the hell? You hit the kid again, I will shoot you in the face. Come here. Come here. Are you dizzy? No. You didn't pass out, did you? No. Does that hurt? Do you need any ice? I think I'll be okay. Yeah. - Did you get her? - Yeah, but it was a mess. I counted ten witnesses, someone called the cops. - We're a little screwed here. - Okay, okay, give me a minute. I'll make it go away. Just make your way out of Memphis. Switch cars, you know what to do. Let's just drop the girl somewhere. Abort. This is no good. No way. You need to bring her in. Non-negotiable. What do you need the kid for? - Excuse me? - She's ten years old. Explain to me why you need a kid. You know the people we work for, Brad. You can't cross them. Don't test me. How you doing back there? Crap. All done? Want to try sitting? Hey, do me a favor, try to find a market, get some ginger ale, saltines, big cup of ice, too. What if they don't have ginger ale? A clear carbonated drink with sugar, Doyle. Are you stupid? Animal crackers. Try to find some animal crackers. You get carsick a lot? I'll tell you what it is, you can't read in the car. That's what it is. Or is it that I'm being kidnapped? A Wrinkle in Time. It's a great book. You've read it a lot? Can I have that back, please? Sure. When did your mama pass away? Three days ago. Stupid crackhead. Was there a service or anything? No. Nobody would've come anyways. Where are we going? To the doctor in Colorado. Make sure you're okay. You're lying. Let's buckle you in. Let's raise the seat up a little bit here. That way you can see and the airbag won't take off your head, which I think we can both agree, that would be better. Hey. Got the, um, stuff. Amy's gonna take the front seat. She gets carsick. He like this song? Yeah. Keep hoping he'll respond. If he's still in there, - I want to find him. - I think he is. I dream about him... a lot. He tells me things. Things like what? He wants to go home. Says he wants to take me with him. It feels so real. It's not just me, either. Lot of the guys are having nightmares. Are you? It's just cabin fever, Grey. I wouldn't read too much into it. He can play as much classic rock as he wants, that baby boomer is gone. They all are. You sure about that? The MRI shows no higher brain function. Sure, they all have their little quirks. Baffes taps his feet like he's dancing. Martinez paces all day. Babcock likes to stare at you. They're just reflexes. She doesn't stare at me. Are-are you kidding? She's making, like, crystal eye contact with you right now. That's her thing. Why was she on death row, anyway? Double homicide, killed her parents. God, people are terrifying. Okay. It's time to feed her. I just want to slap it, I want to slap it, I just want to slap his hideous, beautiful face. Um, you mean kiss? No, I mean slap. Whoa, you got a... You just got a text from Lila. What are you reading my texts for? Just popped up. Who's Lila? - Ex-wife. - You have an ex-wife? What other kind of wife would he have? You're hilarious, you know that? What's the text say? That she's left several messages, and she's worried about you. You're not gonna call her? No. - Look. - Carnival. Want to check it out? Let's do it. Can I, talk to you for a minute? One second, sweetie. - Do we have a problem? - What are you talking about? I'm talking about the animal crackers and the front seat and the letting her use your tablet and watching YouTube and now stopping at a damn carnival. She's cargo! We're going in. We'll meet back here in an hour and a half. Clear? I don't want to talk about any of it. We don't have to talk. The girl should be here in a day or two. A girl. What's her name? Amy. Come here. You vetted the science. It's going to work. She's gonna be okay. Hey, baby, I missed you. Have you thought about me, Clark Richards? Yes. Good. 'Cause I think about you all the time. You and me, we're made for each other. But you shouldn't have lied to me. You'll make it up to me later. You have, like, a goatee made entirely of sugar right now. Here. Unicorn. What is it with ten-year-old girls and unicorns? You probably couldn't win it anyways. Hey, hey. I happen to have a medal in marksmanship from the academy. The academy? How long ago was that? All right, we'll take a round here. You got it. Amy Bellafonte, prepare to apologize for subtly calling me old. Dang. I want that one. You need three to get the unicorn. - Your turn. - I can't do that. - Yes, you can. - I can't. Yes, you can. Ten years old, how do you know - what you can and can't do? - Why in the hell - would I be able to shoot a gun? - Would you watch - your language, by the way? - My God, - you swear all the time. - Why don't you try it... - Don't you know that? - Before you actually crap on the idea? You can do it. Come on. Just relax. There you go. Are you left-handed? Okay. You're gonna put it on this shoulder. There you go, you got it. Now you just got to look through the scope. All right, now, I counted a half second as the first one floated by. So one floats by, you go "one and two." Don't pull the trigger until the "and," okay? Just watch a few, find your rhythm. Dude, there's, there's, like, people waiting, so can we...? People waiting can suck it. Deep breath. When you're ready. Holy... damn it! Did you see that? Yes! Did you see that girl? Did you see her? Yeah, go get your prize, sweetie. That one. Hey. Hey. I finally got you. Yeah, I'm sorry. I've-I've just, um... No, it's fine. Are you okay? Eva's birthday's coming up. It's been three years. It doesn't get easier, does it? No. But I'm okay. Hey, so David asked me to marry him. What'd you say? I said yes. I-I feel like I need to move on and maybe have another baby. What should I say... Congratulations? You could say don't do it. You could say you're coming home. It was a terrible thing that happened, but it wasn't your fault. And if you came home, I would tell you that as many times as it took to make you believe it. I... I can't. I'm sorry. Okay. Call me if you need me. Bye, Brad. That thing is ridiculous. No, it's not, it's freaking awesome. Are you okay? Hey. Should we get going? Yeah. I got to hit the head, though. Mind if I go first? Yeah. Why don't you take a seat over here? I'll be right back. Don't move. New plan. Doyle's not feeling well. He's gonna stay here. We're not going to Colorado. It's a bad place. - It is? - Yeah, yeah. The problem is, there's gonna be some bad guys looking for us, so we got to find someplace safe, which means you're gonna have to trust me. - And I know you may not have good reasons... - Okay. - Okay? - Okay. I trust you. Now let's get the hell out of here. - You're sure? - Let's go. Give me that thing. Come on, come on. Brad Wolgast earned a Silver Star in 2005 and was credited with 98 kills in Afghanistan. This is not the guy we want going rogue. - We need this contained. - He doesn't know anything. He knows enough to make him a liability. Do what you have to do. I know he's your friend. Doesn't matter. Hey, sweetie. Hi. Come on. Come on. What are we doing? I thought maybe this was a nice place for you to say goodbye to your mama. It's important. There should've been a service. What do you want me to do? Maybe you can say a memory. Something nice that she did. You mean besides being a junkie? Yeah, I mean besides being a junkie. She was your mother. Anger is poison. Maybe you can leave some of it here. Okay. One time, for my birthday, she made a birthday cake out of doughnut holes and put whipped cream on top of it and let me eat it for dinner. That sounds delicious. What else? She let me lay in her bed and watch TV. If I ever got scared, she never yelled at me about it. I like that a lot. What else? S-She said... that I was the joy of her life. She said that all the time. Mr. Carter. I'm here to do a quick exam. Your heart and lungs sound great. You are going to be a fantastic addition. Do you have any questions? You didn't tell me your name. Fanning. Dr. Tim Fanning. Yeah, and... w-what's gonna happen to me? Well, I'm not gonna lie to you, Carter, it's gonna be rough. Man, you're bleeding. How embarrassing. Anyway, it's gonna be bad. Then it's gonna be really bad and then it's gonna get worse. But I'm gonna be with you the whole time. And it will get better. And when it does, brother, it's gonna be glorious. A nationwide manhunt is underway for this man, Brad Wolgast, in connection with the abduction of a ten-year-old African-American girl. They were last seen traveling west from Tennessee. Police are cautioning drivers to keep a distance. They believe he is armed and dangerous. Hello? Lila. Some stuff has come up. If Richards calls, tell him you haven't heard from me in months. - Tell him... - Hi, Mrs. Ferber. Riley's incision isn't opening up, that's just the healing process. Keep it covered and dry and come in for a recheck tomorrow. He's there, isn't he? Yeah. That's a possibility. Tell me you're okay. Everything is fine. Is she having any other symptoms? That's pretty quick thinking there, Doc. The thing on the news - isn't true. - Of course not. How can I help? He have other men with him? Um, I'd say... six days of recovery. Thought I could buy myself more time. Listen, I'm running out of moves here. Whatever happens, just... just know I'm trying to do the right thing. I got to go. - Mrs. Ferber, wait a minute. - Lila. You were right about everything. I love you. I never stopped. Sorry about that. Patient. You'll let me know if you hear from him? If I can get to him before the police, maybe I can help. I'm sure there's an explanation. He's your friend. Remember that. It's good to see you, Lila. Okay. There you go. Breakfast. Don't make that a habit. What's going on? Why aren't we moving? I'm gonna surrender. - No, you can't do this. - This is not gonna work. - We can't do this. - We're not gonna make it across the border. If I surrender, we'll be able to get you on TV. They won't be able to hurt you. You're leaving me? This is how it has to be. The only thing that matters is that you're safe. Hey, I want to say something. Hey. Your life is important. You are important. You're wicked smart and strong and fast and funny and tough. You can do anything you want with your life. And that is not my opinion. That is a fact. Can you hear that, Amy? Okay. Okay. Ready? Can we do this? - Yeah. - Okay. Morning. Hey, Sheriff, how we doing with that, reporter? He's on his way. Sheriff. The Department of Defense is on line one. Really? Well, hell. We got to get out of here. I need you to get the keys for these handcuffs. - What? I can't do that. - Yes, you can. They're over there. Behind that desk. Go. Nice. Hey! What the hell are you doing? Put your hands up. Sheriff, listen to me. We all have to get out of here. You see those SUVs behind me? They have some very bad men inside. Stay back. Stay right there. Hands up. Hands up! Wait for me. Turn around. Let's go. Let's go. Show me the exit. Let's go. Hurry up. Let's go, to the exit. Let's go, let's go. This is your guy. This is your... Get down! Put your head down. Let's go. I need you to stay right behind me, do you hear me? - Okay. - Here we go. Come on. Okay. Under this desk. Let's go. - Okay, okay. - All right. Come on, let's go. Let's go. Come on. Brad. Don't do this. You gonna shoot me in front of the girl? You don't understand what's happening. Explain it to me. I will kill you. Give me the girl. You got hit. Are you okay? I'm okay. It's gonna be okay. Seat belt. Hey, look at me. Look at me! It's gonna be okay. You understand? I'm not gonna leave you, I promise. Of everything that happened, this is the part I think of the most. Whatever was coming, we would face it together. Seat belt, now. Captioned by Media Access Group at WGBH. You've seen the fight for humanity on The Passage. Now here are a few more shows to check out from Fox. Welcome to the galaxy. Should be fun. I'll lead. We're gonna make a run for it.
