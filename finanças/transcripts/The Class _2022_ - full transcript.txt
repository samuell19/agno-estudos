- Jason. - Jessie. Oh, good to see you. All right. Good morning, guys. How's everybody doing? That good, huh, Jason? Thank you for that. That's the last one of those, okay? Hey. Hey. Tap him on the shoulder, please. Young man. This is not daycare. Then I'm in the wrong place. Mr. Faulk, why are we in this classroom? Because this is where I put you. Get off the cell or it's gonna be mine. Got it? Okay. Good. Now, please answer when I call all of your names. Okay, Mr. Faulk. I'll take it from here. Hold on a second. I'm busy here. I'm taking attendance. Bro, there's like six of us here. Yeah. Mr. Faulk, why are you here today? Exactly what I was thinking. Okay, kids. The real question... is why are you all here today? I take this class. Mr. Faulk, we're all very grateful for your sacrifice. These are called school rules, okay? I take attendance and then I fill out this form. That's the way it works, guys. Nobody cuts. Nobody causes trouble. All right, guys. So anybody wanna do a warm up, stretching, vocal exercises? Come on, guys. Um, Mr. Faulk. Mr. Faulk. Mr. Faulk. You know like we do... Excuse me. Not now. I'm just wondering about lunch. Oh, yeah. Actually, I, uh, need to eat at least five times a day. Hey, dude, I actually forgot to pack my lunch this morning. I'm actually wondering when the exam would be done? Also I definitely take a pick for my... What's going on? Seriously? Guys! Hello! Wow. Maybe this is daycare. Excuse me. That's not really proper attire, is it? - A little creepy, dude. - And you, do you own a pair of shoes? - Yeah. - Put your feet on the floor. - And button it up, okay? - Uh, Mr. Faulk, it's a Saturday. All right, people. Against my wishes, you've all been given a second chance. So if you blow it, you will all be in summer school. Class, I'll be back in a minute. Come on. - What? - Phil, what was that all about? Just doing my job. Oh, I'm thrilled to hear it. Okay. Their attitude is for shit. - Oh, would you lighten up. - And I heard about you. What does that supposed to mean? I mean, the way you teach. All of these. The hand holding to a bunch of kids that are too lazy to do the work. You know, I heard about you, too. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. I heard that you went to high school here and that you were quite the thespian and not a bad singer. Actually, I was a great singer - till I came to my senses. - Really? And... And realized it was a freaking waste of time. Much like acting class, okay? Okay. I just need you to stay out of my process today. - Your process? - Uh-hmm. Okay. Well, you want a handhold? Go ahead. That's not the way it works out there, Miranda. Was that dramatic enough? You were that girl protesting last week on the school lawn. That was you. It was for a good cause. Knew it. What are you looking at, huh? Just the playbook? It's called preparation. Max, smile. Hey, what are you doing? Why? I can't take no pictures of you? No, you can't. He won't be posting any of that. You know, why don't we all take a group shot? A group shot? For what? Don't we just sign like a release or something? I'm kidding, guys. - Yeah. Good joke. - Yes, that's jokes. No. Come on. I'm serious. Come on. - Let's do it. You in? - You know what? Sure. - Why not? - And she with it. Come on, boy. Move around. Yeah. She wants to take a picture. Let's go, guys. Get up. - Come on. - Get up off your asses. - Go. - Please? - Come on, boys. - Stop touching me. - Okay. - All right. Jessie. Do you want to take the picture? Sure. Okay. I'll just... Okay. I don't look too good. Okay. All right. I think we got some good ones. Got it? Yeah. Send that to Faulk, yeah. So I hear... golden boy, he's been scouted, big shot now. Yeah. What, you jealous, Tarzan? No. Why aren't you on the field today, huh? Same reason we're all here. What other reason would there be? Why don't you get this out of my face, huh? What's your problem? I got a few. You wanna hear about 'em? No, you don't. I can see this is gonna be a fun-filled day. But why are you in this class, huh? Did you stand in the wrong line? Yeah. Maybe I did, why do you care? Well, I sense a humor in this guy. I'll show you my sense of humor. Easy, boy. Easy. Okay? I'm just breaking the ice. Hey, will you be like this all day or what? Warming up my man. You know. Push me. I'll blow this whole fucking place up. - Excuse me? - What? Don't let Faulk hear you talking like that. Oh, fuck him. You're an idiot, Jason. - Oh, yeah? - Gonna lay here all day. Why? You gonna get on top? - Oh, my God, you wish. - Uh-hmm. Okay. Listen, I'm sick of this act. I want you back in your seat right now or I'm gonna throw you out of the school. You have three seconds. One, two, seated. Thank you. All right. Listen up, children. There's something I wanna tell you guys. I wanna make it very... Excuse me, young lady. School rules. We discussed this a few minutes ago. Please put the phone away and no taking pictures. Wow. Do you have one for everybody? - I'm hungry. - Put the granola away, please. Thank you. Okay. Ms. Long's got it. All right, guys. Anyone remember this assignment, this make up exam that we're all here for? Huh? So, if you recall, I asked you to create a character for a scene today. Each one of you is gonna get up there and explain your choices, how you got there and why. And then, you know, what's coming next. Come on. Gonna assign you a scene partner. Scene partners? - I have a question. - What is it? How do we do that? Allie, the same way we've been doing it all year, except this time, no script and no excuses. Better clear my calendar, huh? So no script? Improvisation. - Improvisation. - And then we go home? Why can't you just hand out scenes? Because, like I said, it's about what you've learned. And not only that, it's about connecting to the character, okay. Using your imagination. It should take everybody about a minute. Mr. Faulk, you're not helping. Yeah. What's with the partners? I'm going to assign them to you in a minute and then you have one hour to write it up. Did any of you actually attend this class or what? You will draw on experiences from your real lives. - What if your life sucks? - Then your scene sucks. That's stupid. I hope not. I blew a Saturday for this? - You tell him. - Okay, guys. Listen. Just try to get all the world's troubles out of your head today, okay? Oh, but then somehow y'all old ass - is always screwed up for. - Exactly. Can we just not do that today, please? I've been there. Look inward. Those feelings, those emotions. Uh, you might need to describe emotions because he's only got one and it's anger. All right, guys. Come on. Help each other out, all right? Support each other and push each other a little. You may not like what you find. Michael, since you're speaking up, you get paired up first. You will go with Allie. - Why me? - Casey, - you are gonna work with Jason. - Oh. What? Oh, honey, I'm doing you a favor. - Yeah? - Guess, that leaves us. - Good guess. - Wonderful. - Ms. Long... - Ms. Long. - Yes, yes. Jessie. - All right. Do we really have to work with... Are you some kind of fucking prize? Hey. Language, young man, please. Keep it clean, okay? Guys, guys, I hope you put as much energy into your scenes as you're doing, trying to avoid them. Hey, Mr. Faulk. Mr. Faulk. - You need to get to work. - No, no, serious. - I got a question. - No, you're not serious. -Yeah, yeah, yeah, -You don't have any questions. - Yeah. - And there's no recess, okay? - How did he know? - Hey, you're listening. All right, guys, guys, you've got one hour on the clock, okay? - Question, Ms. Long. - Hey. - Yes. - Whatever... We're about to do this? What you're about to do right now? - Yeah. - Yeah. Or, you know, like, whatever you're talking about. Okay. That's a serious question. Look, guys. I never said it was gonna be easy. You didn't answer the question. Yes. Yes, I have. Okay. As I was saying, one hour on the clock. Ready? - Yeah. - You ready? - You're gonna bring it? - I'm gonna bring it. All right. Awesome. I'm not as dumb as I look. Phil, I asked you kindly to please stay out of it. You know, if this was during the week, yeah. - But, uh, today they're mine. - You know what? I'm just trying to instill trust, if there is all. Without it they stay walled off. Okay. But you're wasting not only your time, but my Saturday, okay? Oh, that's a cool idea. You know what? Why don't you go golfing and I'll tell him - you were here today. - You wish. - I do. - Okay. Well, my job is to tell this principal that these misfits showed up, did their assignments, passed or failed, whatever that's worth, okay? You have a lot to learn about... Well, a lot. No. Actually, what you need to learn is that I'm tenure, you're adjunct. Tenure, adjunct, okay? You failed them. You brought them here. You do the daycare. I'm trying to work here, jack off. You want a hit? Okay. You will miss out. Does anybody know what we're supposed to be doing? We write the paper, I guess. Someone should blow up this school. Second time you've said something like that. Why do you think that's funny? Do you see me laughing? - Dude, you got issues. - Who the hell doesn't? Is this something we need to worry about? Relax. I'm just saying. We're supposed to report language like that, aren't we? What's your problem, anyway, huh? We're supposed to get to know each other? We hear enough of that shit out there. She's right, Columbine. - Now, give it a rest. - So now, you know me. I don't think I wanna know him. What are you doing? What does it look like I'm doing? I'm stretching. Phil, wait up. Look, I don't wanna argue with you. Okay, then don't. But you know that what they need to do in there today isn't easy. What algebra and biology? That's not easy. Art, acting, freedom of expression. Oh, my God. I mean, it's so important for growth. Don't you get it? Okay. Then tell me why those are the first classes they cut when the budget's tight? Oh, my God. That's such an ignorant statement. Well, I think you're running a sensitivity class up there. Do you ever say anything constructive? Yeah. I'd say fail the whole bunch - and call it a day. - Just let me do my thing. I call that hand holding. - I call that teaching. - Whatever. Always walk around with that attitude? You always walk around like yourself? Fuck you. I can't believe you. You started it. - Really? - Yeah. That shit don't work on me. And what does? Guys. Try to do the assignment. Yeah, keep it down, cockazaoid. You think life is really worth living with all this stress? See something, say something? No? College boy. You still talking? No one is interested, okay? Guys. Mr. Faulk is probably right outside the door with his ear to it. Why the fuck would he be doing that? I don't know. But he's creepy. Some of us actually has something to lose. - Thank you, Max. - Like what? You're drinking at school? Are you kidding? You're gonna get everyone here in trouble. - I hope you know that. - All right. You need to relax. - I say go for it. - Back off right now. No, I'm not gonna sit back down. Oh, great. Now everybody's up. Thanks a lot. - Just sit back down then. - I can't believe this. - You bring liquor, asshole? - Get out of my face. I'm not gonna get out of your face. - It's everyone's problem. - No, it's not. Now why don't you sit back down, tough guy? Why don't you put that back in your bag, huh? Get back, man. It's just not that big of a deal. No, I'm not gonna chill. He could have everyone expelled. Expelled for shit, huh? Guys, they could come in. All right, it's gone. You happy now? That's messed up. Messed up, huh? That's what I thought. When Faulk sees this, we're all done. Now here he comes. - I can't believe this shit. - You kidding? He's coming? Yes. Go fucking sit down, huh? Oh my God. So what's all the noise about? You know I can hear you guys in my office, right? Sorry, Mr. Faulk. - We're working really hard. - You heard him. Finding our characters. - As they say. - Emoting. Discovering our most inner thoughts. - Really? - Okay. There's nothing on that paper. Don't tell me you guys haven't done anything. Please, please, please, tell me you have something to show me. We're stuck. We've covered this. Ms. Long, does this... really have to be all touchy-feely? No. It just has to be really honest. Honest? So what did you do? No, no, no, no. It's not about me today. Just tell us. All right. You know what, maybe I will tell you later. Don't worry. I'll remind you. No doubt, Michael. No doubt. Hey, Mr. Faulk. You're respectfully stifling our creativity. Listen, sunflower seeds, if I wanted any comments from you, I'll let you know, okay? So much tension. Yes. Mr. Faulk, I'd have to agree with Jason over there. You're really stifling our creativity, you know? All this tension that seems to follow you into the room. Yeah, I would have to agree too. You do keep on running in here. Uh-hmm. Breaking our concentration. Life. What a waste. Yeah, I think he means today is a waste. Ms. Long, as we can see, this class really lacks discipline. Give me 30 minutes with them. Thank you for that observation. All right, guys. I just bought you another 30 minutes, but it's your last chance, okay? Please let there be something to show when I get back. Right. We actually wanna graduate. Just saying. Mr. Faulk, after you. Remember. All right. Who's up first? Jason. Jason, you were born to do this assignment. Are you ready? Okay, look, in my analysis, my character, he's... he's kind of like what everybody would want, you know. He's a bit of a player but everybody loves... Like, everybody, like, loves that guy, you know what I'm saying? Kind of like a Joey from Friends. Well, I wouldn't expect you all to understand. No, tell us about that guy. Well, he's like a bit of an internet genius type, meaning that he created shit up here. So, I don't know, he's a winner. He did it all in his own. Didn't need anybody to do it. A self-made man. Did it the American way, so he screwed everybody on his way to the top. I'm taking a page from you fine adults. Oh my God. What is this? Well, I wouldn't be surprised, you know. Out there, you're either in or you're in the way. When people are done with you, they move on, right? We're all thrown into this world and... we all just have to figure it out. So my character... lives for today. And that's my analysis now. Well, all righty then. Give it up for your classmate. Come on. All right. - That was very creative. - Uh-hmm. A little disturbing but creative. Anything else to add? No. It's perfect. All right. Who's next? I need a nap. Well, she may be, you know, intelligent when it comes to studying and stuff like that, her lack of communicating with people, talking with friends, and family, and... revealed the true feelings of rejection and pain. This isn't a science project. You're ruining my focus. Jason, you're not helping. Did I interrupt you? Yeah. You did. Whatever. Anyways, this, um... this vulnerability... No, this lack of connecting with people. You're talking about yourself. No. I don't think so. Michael, do you want that when you go up? Sorry. Just trying to help. Well, it's not, so can you please stop? No, you know better. Just... Anyways, when it... When it comes to people, you know, and from my own life maybe, maybe I think... I think we all have this fear of rejection, you know? To be loved and to love someone and not be loved back, you know? Anyways, what I'll use to connect and relate with this character is the fact that I... she. She. She has this problem with, you know, communicating. You guys... you guys know what I just said, yeah? What I meant. Okay. Can I please sit down now? You tell me. Anything else to add? - No. - Okay then. - Thank you. - Well done. Well done. Come on, guys. What the hell did she say? Who's next? Jessie? Ready? Um... So, if she could not sing then she would not want to live. Singing became her breathing, you know? It was an obsession. No, it's more like a passion. It's a place where she can go. Don't we all need a place like that? A place to kind of get away, find yourself, a place not to feel any pain and find happiness. Stop looking at me weird. You say that our soul... if you're not able to live your dream, someone or something stops you from living it, the soul dies. I'm sorry. That sounds stupid. No. No, it doesn't sound stupid at all. In fact, that was really deep and that took a lot of courage to really go there. Did you guys see that? You know, living in the moment, seeing people for who they really are, I look forward to seeing where you're going with this. Well done. Okay. Michael. You haven't gone yet. Everywhere we look, all this violence out there, this freaking chaos, police wasting innocent people, racism, you can't make this shit up. People blowing up people, maniacs streaming people getting whacked, government upside down. Who's running things? What's whacked? Wasting people. Anybody else not okay with this? Michael, where is this coming from? What? You know, all this. I'm talking about the news every day. People getting blown away because they looked at someone the wrong way. I mean, look at this country. There's a revolution out there. You don't need a fucking reason. Just watch the language, Michael. Okay? Getting into my character. Michael, listen. I understand about all these social issues, everything going on out there in the world, but you're 17. Don't get overwhelmed by all that. This is the world you all are leaving us. What are we supposed to do with this mess? What I mean is just don't let all that mess with who you are. So, who are you hiding behind? Excuse me? What does that mean? Nothing. I didn't mean nothing. Listen. - If I can be of any assistance... - No. You can't. I didn't mean it that way. It's not you. I'm sorry. It's okay, Michael. I get it. I understand. This isn't easy. This character, I mean, things are just a little messed up in his head. A little? Hey, can I go to the bathroom? Jason, not now. What? I said it's a character. Yeah, buddy. Then how did you slip through the cracks? Okay. You know what, I am gonna call a bathroom break. I'm watching you. Ms. Casey. You're up. Hmm. Um, my character. So she's lived past lives. She also knows what people are thinking and feeling. I mean, think about that. And to know what the person next to you is really thinking. I mean, talk about the chaos. Anyway... Is there something we don't know about? You would say some shit like that. Listen, my character, she can see inside people. That's stupid. Why? I don't know. It's just stupid. Afraid to know the truth, what people really think about you? - Whatever. - How about your teachers? Or Mr. Faulk. Uh-hmm. Michael's right. We all live a damn lie. We pretend out there, don't we? I changed my mind. This is gonna be a great partnership. All right, Casey. A lot of possibilities with this. Well, it's all I gotta say for now. All right. Best for last, right? Yeah. Give Max your full attention. Yeah, that's likely. In keeping with this theme of being different, I'm thinking... my character is a... He's a... We're all born with something. And something inside, it makes us different. But sometimes we... hide from that, from being who we really are. You know, I can be running down the sidelines inches away from the end zone but my head is someplace else. Yeah. Anyway, this character of mine is lost like that but he finds peace when he... It's kind of stupid but, like, when he... like when he danced ballet or something like that. You know, just a certain freedom. And using this motivation, um... Go ahead, Max. Stay with it. Yeah, he's... I'm thinking he's... he... Okay. - So? - What are you looking at? - You tell me. - Let him finish. Yeah, you know what, I'm done. I'm not in the mood, all right? - Oh. - I said my piece. I get it. Get what? Are we done here? No, we're not. Okay. First of all, Michael, lose the mass murder guy. Not buying it. What's the problem? Do I have to spell it out? Do something else. Okay? And, Casey, look, like I said, really original. But make sure you're not hiding behind those superpowers, okay? Hiding behind superpowers? What if they're not superpowers? What if she just thinks that she can read people's thoughts, but she can't? Hey guys, look, if it were any other class, there'd be a proctor standing over you while you fill out ovals. Is that better? - I mean, do you... - This is all bullshit. No, not you. Not you, Tommy. Not you guys. So here's my picks for the fourth race. I got Jack Wacker, uh, Rock Dandy and Lost Ideal. Guys, you have been here all semester, okay? You... Stop pretending you don't know how to do this. Yeah, I'm still tight, scored a couple. And go prep your scenes, like somewhere else. Go. Out there. Go. Go. Oh, you guys stay on school grounds. I take this. Yup. We chip the track. Why'd you help me out back there? I thought you could read my mind? I'm working on it. What did you mean back there? What are you talking about? About reading people's minds. Talking about me? No. Hell, no. But you wouldn't understand. - No? - No. Okay. So what about our scene? Um, man, don't even know, but we got to figure out something. Okay. So... You know you haven't said two words to me before today. More than two? What were they? Can't think of them can you? Smells weird out here. Would you be more comfortable in the field? Why? You play football? Yeah, right. So you do ballet? No. In the scene, I mean. Yeah, in the... Yeah, in the scene. Why are you being so sensitive about this? Why don't you tell me why are you so gloom and doom all the time? I have my reasons. Look, I'm just trying to do the assignment. Okay? Isn't that now here what we're supposed to be doing? Yeah, I guess. Okay. All right. So, I was thinking that I'm a singer and you're a dancer? And let's say that maybe we're a couple. - Okay? - Yeah. Fine. And... what if you're... What if I'm what? What if you're gay? Would that work? What the fuck does that mean? What? What did I say? What's wrong with you? Max? Whoa! What is this place? I know, isn't it cool? Yeah. I found this place under the theater. Should we really be in here? That's the 911. Oh. The guy can't snap a fishing peace. What's going on here? So, why do you drink? Why do you take this class? Same as you, thought it would be an easy grade. And? And it's hard. Telling the truth is hard. Yeah. So why do you drink? It's the only thing I could count on. Cop out? What's your story? Oh, here we go. What? You, with your fucking Housewives of Bel-Air family and all? Do you have to swear so much? - You started this. - Yeah, well, I think we should start working on our scene now, don't you? Whatever. Will you stop? Why do you care? I wanna know what can be so bad, you wanna blow up the whole world? It's none of your concern. What? Hey. Shit. What the hell is going on up there? - What? No. - Just give it me. - Just give it to me. - I'm not gonna give it to you. I'm gonna put it away. Oh, my God. Stupid. Hey, guys. I hear you. Aha. So, what the hell's going on up there? Rehearsing our scene. Yeah, I'm not buying that crap. No, he's right. We're just rehearsing up here. Okay, both of you, bring your hormones. Come on down. Let's go. Time to get back to class, Romeo and Juliet. Okay, back to class. Nice try. You, I'm watching. You're always doing what you think people expect you to do. No. Then my name would be Max. Well, this whole soul image of yours. Who cares? Someone would if you just... Never mind. What if I told you exactly where you're sitting every day this semester? Don't play with my head like that. You do that enough to yourself. Shut up, Jason. I don't believe what everybody says, by the way. I think you're pretty chill. I heard some things about you. Yeah? You believe it? Just can't imagine that I'm your type. How could you know what my type is if we only said two words to each other? You're afraid of a compliment? I thought you could read my mind? Hey, guys, what's going on? Who's gonna clean up this mess? Come on back to class. Come on. Come on. And we're back. Ms. Long, why are we sitting like this now? Yeah. Why aren't we on the ground like usual? Yeah. A little close, you know? Yes, we are close. We are trying to connect, people. Yeah, I'm so sick of this bullshit. Be honest. Open up. We all go home. You can leave any time you want. Yeah, you all lie. I'm so over this. Do you wanna know? Okay. Let's all be honest. Somebody I know. Okay? She cared about me. Me. She tried to... She took a bunch of pills. Okay? Are you all happy now? I mean, she asked for help, and nobody cared. What happened to her? - Did she... - No. She didn't die. She was pregnant. What? What the fuck are you looking at? No, no, I didn't mean it like that. No. No, not mine. How does anyone deal with that? But she understood me. She was my girl. So, she came to me for help. You know how hard it was for her to do that? You know, I hated her for what she did to me. I don't know what to do. Michael, you can't control what other people do no matter how hard you try, okay? Trust me. So you can't blame yourself for this. Ms. Long is right. You know, I was mad. I told you, "How could you do this to me?" She cried and cried. I still loved her. Didn't matter. He was with this some son of a bitch who promised her the world. Uh, Ms. Long, let's take a five minute break outside, please. No, not now. Not like this. - Michael, is she okay? - Uh, we really should. And you, you teach us how to read, but you don't teach us how to live. I mean, he told her this kid. His kid. Said it was her problem. I mean, her fucking problem. Goddammit. I did nothing. What happened to her? I just told you. No, not that. What? Michael, what about the baby? You say this to me now? Why don't guys just back off, okay? She was just asking a question. All right, look, I will handle this, okay? All right, enough already. Maybe I will call a break. Do you need to talk about this outside, maybe? She had an abortion. I drove her to it. If I ever find out who he is. He's so dead. Now, just leave me alone. - Ms. Long. - I'm calling a break. Michael, I'll be in my office if you need me. I'll be in mine. Come on. I can't do anything. So, don't worry. It's all okay. We got you. Listen. It's okay. No. No. Listen to me. You don't think I get it? You don't think I see what you're doing? It's not... I'm gonna shut this down. Just work with me here. Give me a chance to work with... No. Listen, I've had it. I've had it. You're not equipped or trained to deal with this, Miranda. I know it's not the most conventional way. You think? It's not funny. I'm watching them in there. You're tearing them apart. Don't worry. I'll handle it. I don't see it that way. Thank God I'm here today. What's the matter? I'm fucked up, you know? So, what do you think about it? About what? About what Michael just said, you know, if you had to... If you were put in that situation and... never mind. Over what? If you have to deal with something like that. Either way, it doesn't change who you are, right? No. I don't think so. Change the subject? - Okay. - Hey, Jessie. Look, I... I'm sorry for sounding off right there. It's just... I don't know what I was thinking. I mean, I know you're just trying to do the assignment, and... well, this class just gets in my head sometimes, you know? It's just... It's just ridiculous, but... Oh, Jessie, are you okay? Oh, yeah. I'm okay. - Are you okay? - I'm okay. Jessie! I'm okay, Max. Tell me something about you. Why? Why not? I don't know. What do you wanna know? Anything. I just wanna get to know you. And what if I disappoint you? Disappoint me? I just met you. Why would you think that? Because some things I don't even like thinking about, so I don't know why I don't wanna tell somebody else. Well, I want you to want to. Hey, should I get you some help? No. No, it's fine. - Are you sure? - I'm fine, Max. Okay? - You don't look okay. - I know. I'm okay, Max. I'm fine. I'm okay. It's just... Please don't tell anyone, okay? Promise me you won't tell. I won't. Okay. I promise. Okay. I'm okay. They died in a car crash, my parents. I was like three years old, so I can barely remember them. Jason, um... Yeah. Hey, look, it's weird. It's just like, it's like, sometimes I can... I can feel them, I can hear them, I can smell them but I, uh, can't see 'em. It's crazy, huh? No, no. Well, that's... it's not crazy. That's actually beautiful. I never told anybody at school that before. If Faulk catches us back here, he'll kill us. What you did back there? - What? - You're okay. Thank you. Hey, what are you doing? I need it. No, I know what you're thinking. - Allie, please. - No, you don't need it. You don't. I live with my uncle now, he treats me like shit. He makes me feel like a freakin' hand me down all the time, someone just given away by the court. Jason, I wouldn't have asked actually. It's okay. A long time ago. Look, I'm still that same guy. - Nothing's changed. - It's different now. Today will come and go, okay? That's not true. Have you thought about talking with someone? Who? Faulk? My parents? What about me? You can talk to me. What happens when I walk out this door? You walk out with me. Promise. All right, guys. I hope that break helped you all reset, clear their heads. Listen, what Michael did, proud of you for opening up like that. That took a lot of strength and a lot of courage. And maybe it will help inspire all of you. I wanna sing a song. Song? What? Jessie, you know the assignment? Yes, I do. And you have a partner? Yeah, I'm right here. Jess, what's going on? Yes, I know I have a partner. - Yeah, but it... - Just one please, okay? I know it's not the assignment, but it's the only way for me to... Look. That's how we grade it. I just... I can't change the rules right now. I just... Michael... you spoke the truth? Now I wanna speak the truth. I'm sick. Sick? What do you mean? I'm sick but... it's okay. It's okay now that I talk about it. What? Like the flu or something? Or something. I have cancer. And it's weird saying it out loud, um, but I know I need to say it out loud. I have cancer. Listen, outside when you... Yeah. It's a battle and I'm trying not to lose. But you guys, sometimes I don't know what to do. I can't breathe and I'm just so scared. Hey, can I help? Do you need anything? No. I've got these. Jessie, all this time? How sick are you? Jessie... You're gonna be okay? Like someday? No. No, I don't think so. At least I look at birthdays differently now. They tell me that it could be... Maybe they're wrong? To hell with what they say. No, Jessie, they're wrong. They have to be. That's what I tell myself. But, yeah, I found singing. And I'm not very good but, yeah, it's, um, it's become my best medicine. I'm able to express my thoughts and how I'm feeling and everything that's going on inside, and... that's where I feel like the most me again. And, you know, being sick, have a good time definitely. I just got to take it a day at a time. So, right now, I'm living for today and then we'll get to tomorrow. How are you doing? Yeah. I'll make sure. You don't feel the hot dogs today? Oh, my God. I got some letter. - Oh, that's cute. - Yeah. - He's kind of ugly. - No, he's not. - He's a ten. - He's a ten? I'll take it back, I'll tell you I was gonna be ugly. - Well, we'll grow into it. - I'm sure you will. He looks like a young Johnny Depp. I promise. What is that? What is that? Hmm. That song. Something I'm working on. Something you're working on? - You wrote like a song? - Yeah. - An original? - Yeah. It'd sound better with a guitar. Guitar? Max? Hey, where do you think you're going? I'll be back in a sec, Mr. Faulk. All right. - How are you doing? - Nothing. Are you gonna eat that? Got it from the music room. Make sure it finds its way back. Let's see it. Wow, Jessie. Jessie. That's insane. That was really insane. That's really nuts. Hey, Max, what's going on? Everything okay? Nothing. Max, hey, just breathe. Just be honest like we were outside, okay? Let it go. Hey, guys, something going on over there? What's going on, guys? Everything okay? You know your dad's not up. Can I say something? Of course, anything. I care about getting out of here on time. Jason, just... Max, take your time. Okay. Yeah. Look, I'm just trying to say... I mean, who the hell are we? I mean, something brought us all here today, right? What Michael said. Jessie. Why does it matter what people think? You, Michael, you made me think. You. You living for today, not being afraid. Why don't we all do that, right? Live for ourselves. Not for what my dad wants me or any parent wants any of us to be. You don't have to repeat their mistakes. Live your life, Max. That's what my mom would say to me sometimes. Live your life. She would whisper it in my ear. She knew. She knew what? She knew me. And what does that mean? My dad would kill me. He would what? Forget he ever had a son. Why would he do that? It's okay, Max. It's not, actually. I'm sorry. I can't do this. Hey, hey, hey, where are you going? It's not gonna change anything. - Listen. - Go for it, Max. Max, it's called unconditional love. He'll stop loving me. No. Why would you say that? Because parents fuck everything up. Look, if it's affecting your life like this, you have got to confront him. I say just go for it, man. If it's like tearing you up, maybe he'd understand. Maybe he doesn't wanna talk about it. Look, I'm gay, okay? Dude. Really? I'm gay. We share the locker room together. - Oh, fuck off, dude. - Jason, leave him alone. Jason, that's not funny. Jason, dude, shut the hell up. Can't you see how difficult this was for him? I know, I know. I mean... Miranda. I mean, he could've said something. - Said what? - Fuck you. - Shut up. - Both of you. - Please. - Take it down. My dad... they would kill me. And what about your mom? I can tell she knows. - Won't talk about it though. - Listen, Max, we have some really good counselors here if you wanna talk to somebody. Oh, you mean with someone like you? Great class. Okay. Allie, Michael, what you got for me? Oh, we're still kind of working on our scene. - We're not done yet. - Uh-hmm. Well, she wants to do something where I'm standing like at the edge of a building. She's talking me down from it. I don't know. It's stupid. I thought it would help. What does that have to do with what we were talking about before, huh? Like, what were you talking about, Joanne? I mean, how do you... how does any of that come into the scene? - Joanne? - Yeah. - You said Joanne. - Yeah, I did. So what? I didn't give a name. Did I? I'm pretty sure you did. No, I didn't. Okay, so whatever. Hey, Michael, what's the big deal? Can anybody tell me what's going on here? No, nothing's going on. Can we move on? All right. What are you guys talking about? Who's Joanne? I'm lost. You're always lost. Can we just please move on? All right, can we continue? - Yes, please. - Okay. So, who's Joanne? Shut up. Sunflower seeds, watch your language. Please stop talking. We'll get back to it. All right. You know what? Who here has heard of Neil Simon? He's an American playwright, uh, Oscar and Tony nominated. He wrote works such as Barefoot in the Park, The Odd Couple. He was born in the Bronx. The Bronx. That's what I was getting at. Very good, Jessie. Neil Simon wrote about what he knew, where he came from. He brought himself to his art. What a concept. That's all I'm trying to get you guys to do today. It's actually really simple, trying to let you know that you are enough. Just be who you are. Be who you are? That's not how my father sees it. Oh, okay. Well, how does your mother see it? My mother? Well... she was sick too. I knew it was serious but... my father, he just became this void. Never talked to me. He kind of just walked around me. Never told me. He never just... never just helped me once. He just... He pushed me away. He pushed me away from her. Never got to say goodbye. And he just... He just kept ignoring me. She... she died. You ever talked to him about it? About a thousand times. You know, it's kind of like they both died. I was only eight. Now, I'm 17 and I'm with you guys. But still, after all this time, I miss her. She hears you. You think so? Why not? I hope. But, um, last Christmas, he told me I had my mother's eyes, gave me a present, and then he left. And, you know, no amount of money or presents, none of that can fix what's broken between us because... I'm invisible. I am. This is what I'm talking about. Allie, thank you for sharing that. Sorry. No. Don't be sorry. Listen, this is not easy what I'm asking you to do today, guys. But you're rocking it. - Thank you. - I'm really proud of you guys. Okay. There are two of you left. Who's up? Casey. We all went. What about Ms. Long. - Oh. - What about me? You said that you would tell us what you went through while sitting up here. That's true. Well? Well, you guys aren't done yet, so. That sounds familiar. - What are you worried about? - Just be yourself. Yeah, be honest with us. Scared of a little confession? I mean, you told us to be ourselves, right? - Who are you, Ms. Long? - Just tell us. Come on. Do it. Do it. - You can do it. - Tell us. - Come on. - Come on, Teach. Give yourself to the character. Emote. Oh, my God. The students become the teacher. - Tell us. Tell us. Tell us. - Come on. Come on. Oh, yeah. Okay. Okay, okay. Okay. Okay. Whoo! All right. Give me a minute. It's, um, it's been a while since anyone asked me about my story. All right. Well... taking you back to 12 years old. The teachers in school started noticing things like the way I was behaving and, um... and uh, bruises. Um... I can't believe you guys are making me do this. I'll never forget that day. I was, uh... in my favorite room in the house. It's the one with the record player in it. And I was playing my favorite Billy Joel album. Didn't even get to hear the end of Vienna and there was a knock on the door, and it was two men. And my mom, uh... casually said for me to pack a bag. Um... And I got in the car with these strangers who took me to this place that we had passed a bunch of times in the car. And I never knew what it was, but it was a foster care home. And, you know, I thought it was just like a temporary thing so that my dad could get his act together or whatever. But time went on and on and nobody came back for me. Um, they just left me there. Just left me there. My dad, he had just, you know, left for good and my mom never recovered from that, so that was that. Foster parents, awesome people, Linda and Carl, so cool. They took me to therapy, and God they, tried everything. I just didn't understand what was wrong with me. Like what made me so unlovable that they left me there, and a really great doctor suggested that I just needed a safe space to, like, work through my feelings. And that safe space was theater. And that's when I fell in love with expressing myself through art. So I went for it and I got accepted to this, like, topnotch conservatory and ran around New York City with a heads hot and auditioned a bunch, and I did some theater. But I felt like I had a different calling. And that was this. It was connecting with young people like you, because I've been there, and I just want you guys to be your best, okay? My calling is to give you that safe space to work your stuff out. What happened to them? - To who? - Your parents. Well, I never saw my dad again. And I found out he passed of a stroke 10 years ago. What about your mother? She's still alive. Have you seen her? No. Why not? - I don't know. - Yes, you do. - Yeah, I do. - I don't get it. Rejection... right? It's hard enough the first time. What if she didn't wanna see me again, right? You should still go. Yeah, but she never came back for me. Don't go for her, go for you. Show her what you've become. Yeah, she couldn't break you. They have no idea, do they? The mess they leave when they do that. You're here, that means something. I think you should go. You never know how much time you have left. Well, guys you've given me some stuff to think about. Thank you. Okay. All right. This isn't about me. This is about you. Jason, please take me off the hot seat. - What you got? - What? Am I supposed to get up there and cry some? Yeah, something like that. I did. So did Ms. Long. - I'll go. - Casey. All right. Hold on. I'm sorry. What are you sorry about? Michael. Understand... what happened was no more your fault than it was mine. What? About a year ago, I believed him, just like you believed her. And the result of that tore me apart. I hated everyone, especially myself. I couldn't eat for weeks. I asked myself if I made the right decision. Did I make the right decision? And that's another thing, is there really such a thing as like the right decision? Or is it just... you know, the moment you're living in and trying to figure out how to live it? If I would've... If I would've had my baby. Sorry. I'm sorry. I don't... I don't know why I'm talking to you all about this. I'm sorry, Casey. - Why are you sorry? - No, I mean, I understand. You understand? If you put you in my position for a minute, somebody like you gets pregnant and then people say, "Oh, poor girl. I hope she's okay. "Somebody like me gets pregnant and, "Oh, yeah, it figures. We all saw that coming, right?" Hell do you know. You're right, okay? I'm... you're right. Casey, nobody's gonna judge you or you, Michael, for that matter, for the choices you've had to make, these, like, really grown up decisions. Ms. Long, I know you're not blind. I'm looked at different and you know that. She's right... even in this school. Listen. Life is learned along the way and we're all figuring it out. Really, no judgment here, right, guys? Not today. Did you talk to your parents? Your dad, someone? My dad is... I can't talk to him. I mean, and my mom is either in denial or praying I don't find my way back there again. - I disappointed you. - Your point is? It's what you meant. Ms. Long? Let's have a discussion outside, please. Great job, everybody. Just please meet me outside. All right, guys. I guess we're taking another break. Just take a breath. It's okay. - Where are we going? - Where we can't be heard. Okay. You gotta be kidding me! Okay. We got daddy issues. One kid wants to come out of the closet. One kid wants to blow up the whole world. Then we got abortions. Then you open up with child abuse? - Stop it! Stop it! - No, you're done! You're done! Okay. Don't you get it? They need to know that I went through the same thing. But what was it? What you did in there is unorthodox, okay? - They are kids! - Yeah, they are. Talking through their problems, and we're just telling them it's okay to feel that way. No, no, no. Not me. You. So save it. Who's gonna clean up this mess when these kids go home today? There's peace on the other side of this for them, don't you get it? I know you see it. Peace? Are you kidding me? It's called the unemployment line, okay? So stupid. What's gonna happen when their parents start calling me on Monday? Look, you just need to calm down! No, but you opened up this can of worms. I opened up a safe space, okay? That's what I am giving them. A safe space? Are you kidding me? Listen, stop being their friend and just be their damn teacher. Hey, why don't you start being their friend? And maybe then you can be a great teacher, you ass. - Oh, my God. This is a school. - Oh, that's brilliant. Okay. Listen, you wanna put a Band-Aid on it? But when all the parents start calling me on Monday, guess what, I'm gonna give your cell phone number, okay? Joan of Arc, Mother Teresa over here. Unbelievable. Casey? About what you said earlier, you were right. Yeah? Think so? - I do. - Me too. We're all looked at differently. Is something funny? - Right. What about you then? - I think you guys are right. I don't think it's your fault. I don't think it's anybody's fault. You know what I mean. Yeah, I know what you mean. But what I said, and you said nothing. Guys, wanna change the subject? Sure. Let's change the subject. What about Ms. Long? That was cool, what she did. - I don't think she'd do it. - Yeah, me neither. You guys think she's lying? - Are you serious? - What? No way. No, I don't think so. Why are you staring at me? I'm staring at him. Anything you wanna say? You never answered me. - About? - Let it go. Now, you knew Joanne, didn't you? Wait. We're back to this again? Wait, can you tell me who Joanne is, please? - It's bullshit. - No, wait. Is she someone you both knew or what? - What, you're Mr. Helper now? - Maybe. Guys, I don't like this. I don't wanna fucking hear it. You're gonna answer me. - I think you know, huh? - Know what? - Jason. - Wait. Know what? - Max, leave it alone. - Oh, hold on. No, no, no. I wanna hear this. - You figured it out? - Figure out what? - Guys, guys, let's stop. - Fuck off. Right? You wanna know? Yeah. Sure. - I knew Joanne. - Jason. Why didn't you just say that then? Yeah, I think I can figure that out. No way. Wait, you knew her? - Fuck off! - Hey, leave her alone. Fuck her. I wanna hear it from you. Jason, what is he talking about? All right, now. Now, you guys are all judging me? Michael, listen to me. He's not worth it. - Don't do this. - No, let's do this now, huh? Okay. You can't hold your own fucking shit. - Hold on to my shit? - I don't know why the hell you're in this fucking school, okay? - You should be traveling. - Hey, stop it! Doing something and... yeah. Oh, yeah, rich bitch. Oh, your bitch fucking problems. - Fuck you! - Daddy can't buy me a car. Hold on to my shit? Yeah. Hold on to your fucking shit, okay? Four hours ago, we came in here as fucking strangers, then we're gonna step out of here in three hours as fucking strangers. You watched me crash and burn up there. - Stop! Stop! - I don't give a shit, okay? It's your own fucking life. Deal with it. No! Shut up! I don't have to listen to this fucking bullshit. - You should! - And if I did? - If I did? So what? - No! You just sat there. She almost died 'cause of you! It wasn't my fault. Wasn't your fault? Why don't you mess with somebody else, huh? You're disgusting. Stop fucking looking at me, okay? She left because of you. You fucking asshole. You scared her the fuck away. - Hey! - Oh, my God. - Stop. Jason. - Yo, watch it, bro. Watch it. Stop! No. Yo. Bring it down. Sit down. Will you sit down? Get off me. Fuck you, you fucking bitch. Fucking die. Come at me. Yo, Faulk comes in, we're all done. Well, you wanna blame me, okay? No wonder she fucking... - Go ahead and say it, asshole. - Stop. So today was all a lie. No, you don't understand, huh? Jason, you're bleeding. Did you really tell her? - You blame her? - I didn't know what to do. So you just walked away and did nothing? - Where the fuck were you, huh? - You guys just stop. - No, man, don't. - Where the fuck were... - Michael! - Calm down! Watch it! - Feel better now? - Jason. I gotta fucking live with it, okay? Casey? I have nothing to say to you. I'm sorry, just... It's just not the way you think. Hey. What the hell is going on in here? What have you guys been doing? Look at the mess in this place. What the hell is going on, guys? Max, Allie, I wanna know. Now! We're just rehearsing, you know, getting real in the moment. Stop it, okay? What is going on? Look at his face. What'd I tell you? I told you so. Look at his face. - "I told you so?" - Yeah. Look at this. It's exactly what Max said, like we were told to do. You expect us to believe that? Come on. Yes, okay? We were just rehearsing. - What do you want us to say? - Just rehearsing. - What? With fists? - Yes. Yes. Looks like he got one over on you, tough guy, huh? No, it's just my part of the scene. Look at that, huh? Nice face. What do you think, I'm stupid? I mean, I wouldn't underestimate you, sir. - But if... - All right, Jason. Enough. That's not funny. Okay, you're hurt. Nah, Ms. Miranda, just baby taps. Baby taps? Okay, I'm listening. Who started this fight, guys? Jason? Come on. I don't know what to say, okay? Maybe let's ask Mikey. I'm listening. I'm listening! Come on! Oh, you know what? I think I could piece this together. - Really? - I could piece this together. Like I said, sir. Things happen, you know? Just like you said. Oh, things happen, huh? So you're willing to go down with this guy just because you two don't wanna tell the truth? You forgot to throw in this with summer school. Oh, no. Summer school's coming, don't worry about that. I'll take care of that. You should be worried about your scholarship. - He fell. - Oh, he fell? With the strawberries on his face, he fell? Yes. You guys are kidding me with this. Look at his face. Jessie? Don't. - He fell. - He fell. Oh, you guys belong in drama class. Oh, shit. Okay. And this fell out of your backpack, huh? - What is it? - Don't play that game with me. No, I didn't mean that. I know what it is, I just... I don't know what it's doing in there. Okay, so perhaps a phone call to your father will help jog your memory. - Would that help you? - No, please. - Don't call him, really. - But... Maybe I took the wrong backpack. - What? - Or maybe someone slipped it in while I was on the bus this morning. Oh, on the bus? Do you even know what that is? Phil, she said she doesn't know. It's not in your hands now, okay? - It's mine. - What? Like I said, it's mine. I bought it this morning. Huh. What store? I brought it this morning from my house. You bought it, you brought it. Okay. So what's it doing in her backpack? - I hid it there. - You hid it? - Yes, I hid it there. - That's right. He hid it there. So that's what you guys are all telling me then? Okay, he hid it? Jason? Yeah, and Allie had no idea. All right. This is all bullshit. Why would you do that? I'll ask all the questions here. Why would you do that? Because when Casey and I were practicing, Casey asked Allie if she could borrow her backpack. For like a prop or whatever. I just slipped it in and Casey had no idea, all right? I've just been sipping on it all day. - Huh. - I borrowed it. Really? Well, I don't know what games you think you're playing here. No games, sir. So Jason, this is your story? Yes, it is. If you don't mind... No, no, no, listen, you're coming with me. Okay, everybody, say goodbye to Mr. Personality. He's gonna be leaving for the day, okay? Lead the way, Mr. Faulk. Grab your shoes. Let's go. - Come on, let's go. - All right, guys. Good luck, you're gonna need luck. Be back in a little bit. What the fuck was that? I was trying to cover... Now, why the hell would you do that? I did it for you, okay? Why did you even bring it to school in the first place? We all... You understand that? I didn't, okay? Yeah, Mr. Walker. Yeah, he's here now. Yeah, a little incident. You can come pick him up anytime. We'll see you soon then. Fuck him, he had it coming. Listen, I'm just as pissed off as you. - Look what he did to me. - Get off that, okay? Did we learn anything, you and I? - What? - Casey's right, man. Maybe he's sorry. I mean, he did take the hit for you. What do you think is gonna happen to him? I don't know, I don't know. He could get thrown out for what you just did. You really gotta own some of this, bro. Shut up! Blaming him really lets you off the hook, doesn't it? Okay, just leave me alone! Michael, it's okay. It's okay. I know what you're feeling but we are not our parents. - He could've... - He could've what? He'd have, what, drove her? He could've gave her money? - Then what? - Just stop it! Michael. You can't control what people do, what Joanne did. Allie is right. Nothing would've changed. I know that. It still fucking hurts. We know. We're sorry. Michael, you didn't know what she was gonna do. We're kids, we're just kids. What do we know? He's right. Jason? - Yeah. - About what? About everything. You know, my fucked up attitude. It's okay. It's okay, we got you. I don't understand. You know what? I really wish I had someone like you a year ago. So... anyone here think Ms. Long and Mr. Faulk are hooking up? I mean, they leave to go in the hallway, like, all the time, right? Like... Hey! - What the hell are you doing? - Walking it off. You bring alcohol to school? Are you an idiot or something? Hey! Hey, what the fuck is going on here? Here we go. And for you. What do we do with these? You are going to write in them. Write what? Y'all still need a grade, right? - Yes. - Yes. Then you are going to write about your experiences today, how each of you affected one another. That's it. - That's it? - Yeah. You're gonna write about today. And how you see yourselves now. - Um... - Not so hard, is it? The only time that I get a reaction out of you is when I fuck up. Oh, you're just dying for a reason to get booted - out of school, huh? - Huh. And what the hell happened to your face? Would you believe me if I told you? What about the scene? Well, since Casey lost her scene partner and everything else that's happened today, I felt this would be the best replacement. Any objections? I didn't think so. What the hell is going on with you, Jason? - You wanna fucking know? - Yeah, I wanna know! - Yeah? - Yeah! - Yeah? - Yeah. Ms. Long, why this? - Why now? - Why not? Nice Band-Aid. Not what I was thinking, but I get it. You know, I hurt somebody, okay? - Who? - I fucking hurt somebody. This girl. I got a girl... What? - I got a girl pregnant. - You stupid son of a bitch. Okay, now, you guys have two hours to complete the assignment. And maybe this day will be over. Thank God. It's a big maybe. Okay. Sorry there, I didn't mean to... The last time? Won't happen again, I promise. Yeah, sure you won't. - Even if I fucking let it. - Hey, hey, I'm upset. A lot has happened today. And I want you guys to write about it all. All of it. Who knows? Maybe the next Neil Simon is in this room. - Not me. - Have fun. Aim high. You're ruining your life, son. You don't know what you're doing. You can't even take care of yourself, let alone a kid. You don't got to worry about it anymore, okay? She... She's not pregnant anymore, okay? I wasn't there for her, I wasn't there when she got hurt. Come here. Come here, son. - You really got hurt, huh? - Who fucking cares, okay? She tried to kill herself because of me. - Jason. - I deserve it. Say it. You always fucking say it. Just say it. Jason, look at me. Look at me, son. I'm not your son, man. I know, I'm... But I think of you as... I mean, they can't flunk us all. Actually, they can. - I don't care. - Yes, you do. - We all do. - Okay. But what about Jason? What about him? I wonder what's happening to him right now. Shit, he's probably suspended at least, guys. What do you want from me? I'm not saying it's your fault, but... Guys, whatever we do, we need to do for all of us, okay? - Including Jason. - Right. As a group, a class. He's part of us. So what, we all take the bullet? What he did back there, he did for all of us. So yeah. Uh-hmm. Michael? All right. What can I say? You're right. Wow. This morning, never would've guessed I'd back him. It's come a long way - since 8:00 AM. - Yup. - Yeah, no kidding. - Yeah. Can imagine what his parents are doing to him just about now. Yeah, poor guy. I miss 'em. Uh, I think about them all the time. My mom... my dad. Why did they have to die? I don't know why I'm this way. I don't know why I do this shit that I do, you know? I don't know why I'm so fucking scared to love. I just... Hey, hey, don't be so hard on yourself. But I just like feel them around me sometimes, you know? And I don't... I don't fucking understand, okay? I just... I just... some days, I just... I need them. I wish that they were there. I wish I could just - fucking tell them, you know? - Yeah. You know, some days I just wish that they could hug me, you know? Yeah. I mean, I fucking miss them, man. So do I. I got you, I got you, I got you. - Jessie? - Yeah? Does it hurt? What... What you have? Yeah. Sometimes it does. Are you gonna be okay? I don't know. Guess I gotta hope for the best and prepare for the worst, but... I'm scared. Well, it's nothing worse than what's going on in my head. Michael. Oh, my God. We all need to start living for today. I mean, start changing the things that really need changing, you know? I'd say that's hard enough. Yeah. Will it matter? It's regret that matters. Well, what about you, Max? I'm definitely gonna regret getting an F. Same. You know, one thing I know for sure, serious when I say this, your parents loved you very, very much. Your dad, my little baby brother talked about you every day. You're the best thing in his life from the moment you arrived in that hospital, from the moment you opened your eyes, man, he just... loved you. - He said that? - Oh, he said that, yeah. Every day. And your mom, she loved you. She just wanted the best for you. To live life to the fullest. You know, I think... I know that they are here right now. Right now. God. You look so much like your mom. You do. Hey. Don't be scared to love. This girl... did you love her? I don't love. Of course you do. Just think of them. Nothing's worse than guilt and remorse. And I've learned to live with that. It's not you. Jason... I've let you down, I know. - It's okay. - No, it's not. It's not okay. I'm sorry. But I want you to know that... your parents would be very proud of you right now, as am I. I love you. I love you too. Thank you. Oh, okay. So... what do we do now? About... About these papers. Well, we have to do something. I don't know what to do. Yeah, either. How hard can it be? I don't like that face. Michael... what are you writing? Well, she says we can say anything, right? What? - Uh-uh. Now, what you up to? - Let me... Calm as a bitch, huh. Can she really give us an F? - Yeah, she can. - Yeah. Like a real F? We're about to fail theater? No. I think we all... - I think so. - I don't know. No, I can't. What are you writing about? Mike, your handwriting is trash, bro. - Man, screw you. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, I'm just saying, like, I got chicken scratch, you got rooster scratch. You know, like, you got jokes, huh? Oh, he got jokes today, man. Okay, kids. Put those pens down. Whoa, whoa, I'm not finished yet. You are now. Uh, guys, I asked for five pages, I see barely anything written. It's all there, Ms. Long, what you asked us to write, I mean. Uh, how so? How we changed today, laid bare on the page. - Yeah. - It's bare, all right. The walls you helped us break down. This is what you wanted. Oh, what I wanted was for you guys to learn how to express yourselves. Yeah, we're like a science experiment to you. Is that what you think? Does it really matter to you, or you Mr. Faulk, what any of us thinks? Nobody was prepared for this. Just trying to open you up, that's all. Yeah. And how'd that work out for you? Hey, she did it, not me. That sounds like something one of us would say. There you go. I am just trying to help you break through those walls and the things that hold us all back. It almost tore us apart. Almost. You wanna know what the hardest part about being here today was? Tell me. The hardest part of this class was learning how to be ourselves. Each of us mattered. But now we matter to each other. Oh, a bunch of hypocrites. You know, frankly, it doesn't really matter who you think we are. I'll still be gay. I'll still be sick. I'll still be neurotic. We'll still be all of that. But now, maybe this time we'll be friends. Hundred percent. We just got to be ourselves out there where it counts. Fail one. Fail us all. Did you guys rehearse that? - Jason, too. - Yeah. Yeah, we're one for Jason as well. You guys are breaking my heart. But can somebody tell me what the hell happened here? Hard to grasp, huh? Mr. Faulk, there are plenty of available counselors - for you to talk to. - Touche, kid. Nice one. All right, guys, I get it, okay? What do you mean, okay? Maybe I should change the way I give finals, but... I'm giving you all... A's. Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait, wait. You can't do that. - I can! - No, you can't. Sorry, yeah, I just... yeah. - There we go. - You can't do that. Yes, she can. I can and I would. I don't give a shit what you think. So get out of here. - Go on. - You know what? - Please. - I'm going to track. Bye, Mr. Faulk. Have a nice weekend, Mr. Faulk. That's a shame. Look at him. I won't forget today. The class is... dismissed. Yes. Finally. And scene. Bye, Ms. Long. Oh, my goodness. So what are you guys doing later? We're never doing that. Got some explaining to do at home. You'll be fine. Yeah, I'm not so sure. You will be. Here. Give me your phone. Okay. Here is my number. Call me or text me anytime, anything you need. I might give it to some football guys. No, but seriously, I'd be happy just to hear it ring, so whatever you need. I mean it. Appreciate it. Is your dad really that rich? Yeah. Yeah, he is. Hey, if you ever need a couch. You sure? I might. I mean, what are you all doing tonight? You wanna hang or something? I have this stupid dinner event with my dad tonight, I can't get out of it, but does Monday work for you guys? I mean, I have practice but yeah, - I might show up. - I'll show up. - I'll definitely show up. - I know you will. - Uh-hmm. - Well, see you guys then. So... are you really that depressed? Come here. Thank you. You were never invisible to me. Stop. Jessie, what are you doing next Saturday? Um... I need to run a few tests at the hospital. Call me after? - Yeah? - Yeah. Or... I don't know. Maybe I could come with you. - Really? Uh... - Yeah. I mean, it could take a while. I don't mind. I mean, what else would I be doing? - Okay. - Okay. - Yeah. - Okay. I'll see you Monday, all right? Casey... I'll see you Monday. Max, I'll see you, too. Bye, Allie. Michael, wait. You still didn't tell me. So what are you doing tomorrow? I don't know. You tell me. Hey, singer. I'm sorry for being so sensitive before. You have your reasons. Sorry for being so doom and gloom all the time. Yeah, well, I guess you had yours too. Thank you. You're gonna be okay. Casey, you got a ride? Um, yeah, she's coming soon. Okay. I'll see you around? Yeah. See you, Jess. Bye, guys. And I think you're a great singer. Sure you don't want me to wait? No, I'm good. All right. Well, uh, you've been on those sunflower seeds, huh? All right, kid, I don't wanna see you next week. Jessie. Oh, uh... Thank you for letting me use the guitar, Mr. Faulk. I'm sorry, I forgot to drop it off. Oh, don't worry about it. Listen, I was thinking, there's that annual talent show that the school has. It's coming up in a few weeks. Yeah, I know. Well, you sing really good, kid. Thank you, Mr. Faulk. You know, someone once told me that you did, too. No, it was a hack. I wanna see you at that talent show. What? Keep the guitar. You're gonna need it. - Are you serious? - Yeah, don't worry about it. Just don't tell anybody, okay? Because I have about a shred of a reputation to protect around here. Thank you, Mr. Faulk. It's okay. Go. What are you doing here? I want to see you. For what? I swear I had so much to say. I'm just a little nervous. Oh, before you say that, I wanna apologize for what was said before. No. Oh, my God. No, I'm sorry. Look, I just... I don't think I really understood this morning, like... Understood what? Who I was. Who I am. What makes me... I, um, I just... Well, I'm glad you came back. Really? Really. - Really, really? - Really, really. You know, today didn't go so good. Well, the day is not over yet. It's true. So in that case, there's someone I'd like for you to meet. What are you talking about? I'm Jason Walker. Pleasure to meet you. Pleasure meeting you. Uh, can I walk you home? Um... - I live a few miles away. - That's okay. Sunshine, I think I can hear the birds chirping. Honestly, there's nothing I'd rather do. Um, okay. Okay? I can take this by the way. Thank you for grabbing it. I can also take your jacket. Thank you. What did you write for that. Uh... A few things. Oh, by the way, you got an A. What? Really? You can do this.
