Right. If two people love each other, there's no point in marrying. Renata is right. Marriage is a uncivil social system. - It offends the rights of men. - And of women. We broke the chains that tied us to the male sex. Let's love each other and that's it. Without idiotic sentimentalism and participation of the heart muscle. - They are useless complications. - And bothersome. When two people tire of each other, they should break up, but as friends. Sure. What do you say, Marisa? I don't know. Now it's a problem that I'm not interested in. - Right. You don't have a boyfriend! - If you're interested, you found a boyfriend... me. - Thanks, but you're not my type. Look what that crazy girl is refusing! Incredible! Think it over, Marisa. I am very much in demand. You're a man of easy love affairs. You go from one girl to another. Say that you care about two hearts in a cottage, and eternal love! No. I only think about Italian and Philosophy. - I will get my diploma in October. - You'll spend your holiday studying? - What for? - For culture. - Ignorant people live just the same. - I see that, but I want to work. - With all the money you have? - I'll help my father in his factory. He only has me. He's the person who raised me. Marisa, your last year's suitor is coming. Good boy! Good boy! That guy is your type. He's like an old fogey, consistent in time, very studious. He only cares about staying home and being with mommy. - Excuse me! - Look where you put your feet! Good morning. Good morning. He's so funny! He's drowning. Do something! Hurry, pull him out! The usual stupid jokes! Go on! Where is he? Down! Here he is! - He's like a tin soldier. - Come on! Come on, guys! - Give me a hand! - Let's save this guy! Help me! No! No, no... Thanks. - Were you drowning? - It's nothing. Thank you. If you don't know how to swim, why don't you wear a life jacket? I know how to swim, but... The pool has such a low bottom... Watch out for glasses of water. You can easily drown in them. No. It's that... I hit my head. But I'm happy about this misadventure. Cigarette? Does someone smoke? No. That way, I could get closer to all of you. Even last year, I tried to get closer, but... You too, Miss Marisa, but you always escape me. Now that the ice is broken, I hope to know you better. We can spend some fun evenings together. Right? Yes, for... for everyone. These matches don't work. Excuse me. Maybe I'm a bit humid. I'll go change and be right back. - A mint snow cone. - What? A mint snow cone. - How much? - 400 liras. Excuse me. Put it on the bill. Dear Baron, he must have wanted to take a swim dressed, with tie and glasses. He must be a bit crazy. It's the heat. 37 degrees in the shade. Seven people died in Milan. I'm surprised he is still alive. Why all these flowers in my apartment? - The Commendatore sent to you. - To me? How did he know I was coming today? He had it decorated after you confirmed the apartment. - What a delightful hotel owner! - Good morning, Mom. Good morning. Carlo! My dear son, you're perspiring so much. It's a torrid summer. 37 degrees in the shade, 12 under water. Sorry. Explore from south west to south. - Any news? - N as in "no". - Continue the search southeast. - Yes, sir. Remember to immediately communicate any sighting of big tonnage units. Is that clear? Very clear. I'm scanning. - Objective identified. - Lifeguard! Here I am! - Yes, ma'am. - A beach cabin. Right away! Please. - Why don't you give me that one? - It's empty. - Does it have to be full of people? - Oh, no, my kind lady. With a client like you, we reserve a cabin with all comforts. - What comforts? - All, except for religious ones. Wooden chairs, wooden coat hangers, Murano glass mirror... - What's so special about it? - You, lovely lady! I am a professional. My pupils are blazing with the female sex. - He has good taste. - If I may, I'll get undressed. Go on. Out! - Excuse me! - She's touchy. - The phone call. - Right! Baron, you're wanted on the phone, from Palermo. - Dad? - Dad. It's urgent. I'll be right back. - I'd like a beach cabin. - Right away! Colomba! Colomba, come here. You're always looking for an excuse not to go swimming! Get undressed! Everything is in order. Alright. Here. Why? Oh, alright. Here. Let's hurry. - Madam! Madam! - What is it, Colomba? What do you want? What sort of dump did you have me watch? - It's still first choice meat. - It's stuff for broth, all bones! - Don't say it! - What? I'm paying! - What is happening to me? - How marvelous! Nothing serious, Baron. A small problem. - An eye doctor is in your future. - An... These screams remind me of the trip in Africa with my poor Filippo. - I feel like I'm among savages. - Yes, you're right. - Why do they yell so much? - They're manifesting exuberance. -They're letting out stress. - Then why aren't you yelling? Because I'm not exuberant nor stressed out. I depends on your upbringing, your birth. You'd never stoop so low as to behave so ungracefully. Right! - Mrs. Amalia, shall we dance? - With pleasure, Carlo. Excuse me, dear. - How is he dancing? - As in the Thirties. I think he's wearing an orthopedic corset. - I'm bored. I'll go study Bacon. - You can't digest bacon at this hour. You'll get an upset stomach. Good evening. Good evening! Good night. I don't want to learn. I'm afraid of water! If they find out you don't know how to swim, they'll fire us both! A real lifeguard must know how to save people. I know how to save people on boats. When the drowned person surfaces. What if he doesn't? - You are there. - Yes, but it's easier with 2 of us. Come on! You'll like my teaching system. You are tall and overbearing. What should I do? - Don't push! Speak with your mouth. - Be quiet! - In a prone position. - Okay, I'll eat some prunes. Prone. Like this! To say "face down" you use the word "prone"? Relax. What are you touching? Don't touch me. - Open up your arms. Bravo! - Don't make me fly. Are you ready? Raise your right hand! - There. - I said hand. - I'm left handed. - Raise your right foot. - There. - Sink it in the water. - Sink... - Push backwards like this. That's it, push! Push backwards. - You jerk! - What should I do? - Push like this with the right hand, with the left, right, left... Arms open wide... Hands up! My gosh! Hands up! Stop, please! Mr. Ringo, don't hurt us! We know nothing about the treasure. We didn't do anything. Maybe it was... What is it? You said hands up. Why did you say it? Because you must submerge your head in the water. - Why? - In the sea you must submerge it. - What if I drown? - Drown in a basin? You never know. The water could be high. - Easy. Don't push. - Submerge! - It's salty! - You wanted fresh water? You must get used to it! Try again! Easy! I don't want to be a deep sea diver. Submerge your head, open your arms, move your head and arms. You must move your head and arms simultaneously. I don't know how. Either the head or arms. Choose. - You must do it! Try. - You try. - Me? You said "me"? - You, you, you, you. Are you forgetting that I am a swimming champion? - No. - Lieutenant of lifeguards. - I know it. - Gold medal for hydraulic valor. - You're a plumber. - Hydraulic valor! - 50 obstacle laps! - Obstacle... - Do you know who I am? - Yes, you're my friend. - I started swimming as a baby. - In a sea of pee! As a baby! I was a child and was already swimming. - What do you want to see? - What do I want to see? - Frog stroke or butterfly stroke? - I prefer the elephant one. - I like elephants. - Frog or butterfly. Which style? Luis XIV style. - Stylish. - Alright, free style! - Attention! Get off the horse. - Where is the horse? That one. Get off. - It was kicking me. - Hold still, please! - I'm telling him that. - Observe the first exercise. Attention! I will do the crawl stroke. - Crawl! - A brand, a guarantee. I will do the crawl stroke. Lungs open up and... Help, I'm drowning! You just witnessed a crazy crawl! - Marisa! - Ehi! - Come! - Now he'll torture me with studying. - Rebel. - We'll help you. No, I have to please him. Bye, guys. I'm going. - Good morning, sir! - Good morning, kids! - Hi, Dad. - My child! Having fun, huh? - How's it going? - Just fine. - Your studies? - Alright. See? Just fine and alright. Even your studies should be just fine. You'd better return to Milan and have lessons with a good teacher. You can't ruin my vacation. I will pass, don't worry. I hope so, my child! - So what will you do? - May I go back to my friends? No. Are you crazy? Come have lunch with me. I've important guests that I managed to invite. Come. Goodbye! By the way, naughty girl, you didn't even give me a kiss. - I'll give it to you later. - No. I want it now. Kissing parents in public is old fashioned. What is in style with parents now? Slapping them? - Give me a kiss. - No, not here. - My friends are watching. - Who cares about your friends! If you kiss me, I'll give you 20,000 liras. - No! - 50,000. 100,000! - A little kiss! - Not even for a million. Right, miss. Refuse! Who is he? - It's none of your business. - Shame on you, flirting with girls. Idiot! She is my daughter! - Excuse me. I didn't know. - Well, learn to know people! We don't have "father and daughter" written anywhere. Should we go around with a sign saying "father and daughter"? You should have a sign with written, "Idiot"! So you won't be mistaken for an intelligent person, southerner! It's an open book, my young friend, a sort of showcase! There's nothing else to be discovered. That is why I'm disinterested, indifferent. Baron, you are wanted on the phone, from Palermo. - Dad! - Dad, urgent. - Excuse me. I'll be right back. - Go ahead. Please, please. - Good-day. - Good-day. There. Don't rub yourself against me. Nothing doing today. Go away. You were very naughty. You won't get anything. Don't make that face. I'll forgive you this time. Come. The hole! - What do you want? - 5,000. Supplement. - Hurry! - Here. The hole! The hole! Come on! Come on! - Darn! - Two. Are you happy now? Are you happy? She was talking to the dog! - Fritz, will you help me? - Here I am, Tilde! What joke is this? She was in a bathing suit talking to a dog. - To a dog? - A four-legged animal. One of those that goes... Right. Fritz, let's go for a swim! - You call him a dog? - I have hallucinations. Nothing serious, Baron. An optical dystonia of the cornea. You need double glasses and a cascade of eye drops. It's crazy! Yes, as we say in Milan. Your son who graduated in Philosophy, in Italian, with 110 and the academic kiss, my daughter who must take exams over in October in Italian and Philosophy, without even a handshake. You must not be upset. Your daughter is a bright girl. Very kind of you, Countess! She's the most interesting girl in the group. Mom is right. The most interesting and less noisy. - You find my friends noisy? - A bit. There's nothing wrong with it. You sound so formal. Don't you know each other? We just say hello. The professor is always to one side. Actually, I tried to get close, but... I had the impression that my presence isn't appreciated. Very well! I found the way to solve everything. If the countess agrees, and has nothing against it, her son, the professor, could give Marisa private lessons. So this form of intellectual contact can facilitate the friendship between the professor and the group. - Dad... - You be quiet! No "Dad", or you're going back to Milan. Do you agree, Professor? Of course. If the lady accepts my modest lessons... I must advise you that I'm not an easy student. You would be an exception. Youngsters today are all difficult. And... If we take a brief walk, we can begin lessons right away. - The Aristotle method? - Exactly. Aristotle taught while walking, and the results were excellent. They'll surely get along. My Carlo knows what he's doing. Your son is a bright boy. Oh, yes! So young and already a professor! I'd have liked to be one. We are all born with a destiny. You are a very good hotel keeper. Countess, don't say I'm a hotel keeper. Modestly speaking, I'm a textile industrialist. I invented Biella. I created this lovely hotel complex only for my daughter. She wanted to go swimming so I built all this. You are a wonderful father! If your daughter had wanted to be a nun, you'd have built a convent. Great remark! You are the funniest countess I've ever known. Don't say that. You should've known me before. I have closed myself in my shell. Well, but... The shell... Let's open it. It's impossible. My poor Filippo had the key. - In his place, I... - What? I'd try with another key. - Your coffee, sir. - You had to come now? What is it? Do you feel ill? No, go away. - The coffee is black. - Why did you bring it? - I'll bring the sugar. - Hurry. Who are you? - The head waiter. - How long have you been here? - I'm going. - It was about time. If I must say the truth, I really don't remember him. With so much personnel, how can you remember each waiter. - Of course. - It would be... - He said it didn't have sugar. - Right. Thank you, Countess. Shall we pick up from the minor poets? No, I hate them. Why do we study them if they are minor? - Minor compared to the great ones. - I don't like in-between things. The minors are not the in-betweens of literature. They are excellent poets, and many are innovators. - Shall we talk about Bandello? - Bandello! Why did he write, if Dante, Petrarca and Boccaccio had come before him? Bandello was a major who became a minor when compared to great poets. Like Belloni, a great cyclist, that had the misfortune of racing with Girardengo. - Are you an expert in sports too? - Why not? The world isn't just made of philosophers and poets. - Come! - Come with us! You don't die of love, not even if the love is as great as mine for you. With time, the signs that our love left on me will disappear. And I may forget having loved you, having given my life to you. And I will be able to start over again without, without you, without you! You don't die of love, not even if the love is as great as mine for you. With time, the signs that our love left on me will disappear. On me. You don't die of love, not even if the love is as great as mine for you. For you. - Without looking? - Yes. I follow rules. A kiss, if you guess. A dive, if you're wrong. - Alright. - Go! - Turn him around! - Come on, Professor! Where are we? Move! Professor! Professor! Turn, turn, turn! Look at him! Sir, come with me. Help me play a joke on Carlo. - On the count? No, the professor! - He wants to play. Alright, let's go. He is... he is... - He's the Commendatore - How did you guess? - From the nose. - No, the moustache! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! - Who will give me a kiss? - Him! - Kids, no funny business. - It's a rule of the game. - I guessed, and have to kiss you. - Alright, a kiss. I don't understand! - Do you always sing with glasses? - Even when I shave. Without glasses you wouldn't be able to sing. One night I dreamed of singing, and I woke up with glasses. In the unconsciousness of sleep, he reached out on the night stand, took the glasses, and put them on. No. That night I was so tired that I fell asleep without talking my glasses off. - Rocky, how'd your song come about? - Surely it has a story. Mine does, too. After the rehearsal of a show, all the musicians, authors and directors said, "Come to my house. We'll go and make pasta." One evening, after having learning how to make pasta, I said, "Tonight I'll go for it", and the authors wrote a song. If you were at the sea, would the song be "Tonight I'll Go For a Swim"? No, it probably would be "Tonight I'll Go For a Dive"! Bravo, Rocky! "Vague stars of the Bear, I did not believe I'd again contemplate you" "on the paternal sparkling garden and reason with you from the windows" "of this hotel where I lived as a child." "and saw the end of my joys." - It's not over. - I know. It's very long. - I used to like Leopardi. - Not anymore? He's too sad. Maybe because we're at the sea, with all this light, this joy of living. I want to be happy. Happiness is inside of us, in knowing what we want from life, and above all, in knowing how to be content. You should be content with what you have. Isn't that so? Yes! Yes, I'm happy. I've always been happy, My father adores me. I have everything. I love Leopardi. Despite his melancholy, he loved life. It's true. Leopardi desperately loved life, beautiful things. I am glad that you're saying this. "What immense thoughts, what sweet dreams inspired the view of that sea" "and the blue mountains that I discover." "And I thought that one day I would cross arcane worlds," "arcane happiness, pretending in my life." - Miss Marisa! - Yes? - You're not going to the beach? - Yes. I'm going now. I prepared everything for you! - Come to the beach with me. - Yes, I'd love to. - You revolutionized my calendar. - Me? Excuse my ignorance, but I'd like to know how? When you arrived, I knew it was Saturday. Now you comes on Thursday. Dear Countess! I'm happy you noticed. When I've an interest in something... - You always think of interests. - No, don't misunderstand me. It's a particular interest. "Cherchez la femme", as the French say. - You still hope in love! - What's wrong with that? I only want to live off of my memories. No, Countess. I think you're wrong. You're wrong! How can I forget Filippo? - When Filippo charged... - Filippo? - My poor husband. - He charged? - Yes, with a saber. - Wow! - He charged with a saber? - It was a spectacle. Trot, gallop... charge! Savoy! Colonel of the 3rd Cavalry, a unique man, irreplaceable. - Then he fell. - At the Russian front? - At a horse competition. - From the horse! No, from the grand stand. He misplaced his foot and... He dragged his broken leg for a month. Then the pain took him away. Well, but... you must react, Countess. I can't. When I go home, I see Filippo's saber. Look in another direction or put it in a trunk. You're still young, Countess. Life can offer wonderful things. For you, the world is still dressed in pink! In gray, all in gray. - Are you going? You're leaving me at the best part? - I'm going to my rooms. - Just now that I was trying... - I'll see you for lunch. - I'll count the minutes, Countess. - Your kindness is touching. - What I wouldn't do for you! To see you happy, I'd enlist as a volunteer in the Cavalry! What you are saying is nice, but that army no longer exists. - There are tanks now. - Tanks? How great! Charge! What do you want? Why are you moving that finger? I made an involuntary gesture. Charging was a military game. - It's not for that. - Why, then? - May I dare? - Dare. You don't know how to behave with the countess. - How dare you? - You said to dare! You're right. Then... dare, dare. You don't know how to behave. I followed her with binoculars. - You are a spy! - Yes, but for a good cause. If you want, I'll teach you the art of seduction. The countess will fall at your feet like a door mat. - You have a method? - One? Tell me! - What is it? - Ten, one hundred methods! - I just need one. - I will tell you. I'm an easy man, a man of the world, a summer beach world. Right! Then tell me. - I'll teach you how to seduce. - I wish! - I easily seduce. - You? Camay soap compared to me is a joke! Don't be foolish. Camay soap seduces three times. Right! Let's go. Chest out, stomach in. Come. Finally alone. Nobody will see us here. You are madly in love, and the countess knows it. But she's waiting for your gesture, and you're not moving. I make moves, but every time she just leaves. - You have to turn to violence. - Me, violent with the countess? - Never! I am a gentleman. - You're not a "commendatore"? - I'm a gentleman with women. - Commendatore of labor. You didn't understand a thing. I don't use violence with women. The violent system has always worked with women. - What should I do? - Grab her and embrace her! - Easy. You're hurting me. - The countess tries to back off. - I'm trying, but you don't let go. - You insist on holding her. - You be the countess. - If you don't let go, how can I? I'll let you go. The countess will soften up. You be the countess who softens. That's it! - Passionate lips... - How? In the end, she'll be a slave of man's overbearing force, and she will surrender! - Madman! - Take your hands off of me! - I was demonstrating. Demonstrating what? Violence doesn't work with the countess. - Then pull out sweetness. - What exactly is this system? - I'll explain. You be the countess. - Again? You be the countess, without a hat. - Why? - There. Beautiful! Wonderful! You take her hand gently, tenderly, and begin to go up, up, up. Like this... Like this... - Where does the hand go? - To the right point. The back of her neck, and she shivers. Shiver. - This is a cold shiver! - What sort of shiver? A sensual shiver. At this point, a Gregory Peck type kiss. Keep your hands to yourself. Gregory Peck, my foot! I'll slap your face and make you turn around! It's... Stop it! - I'll leave, or it'll end up badly. - You're leaving me at the best part? - Shame on you! - For what? - You followed the amphibian's steps! - Me? - Don't get close again. Disgusting! - Ciccio, don't be jealous! Let me be. Let me go. Let me stay, please. Don't anyone think of me. - You want to dance? - No. I'd rather sit down with my professor. Fabrizio is phenomenal! He picked up the blond 5 minutes ago, and is already dancing with her. - It's not extraordinary. - It's just the beginning. When the dance is half over, he'll take her towards the pool. - Does he always do that? - Every evening, even on Sunday. And all holidays, of course! She gave me her hand. What do I care about a stretched out hand? Just out of curiosity, without a real reason, without a meaning. And so... and so... Let me be. Let me go. Let me stay, please. Don't anyone think of me. It's just my business. I'll do as I please. I like it just the way it is. Bravo, Rocky! - So you don't want to dance? - I've something important to do. - I must go over the minor poets. - The minors would be majors, if it wasn't for the great poets like Dante, Petrarca and Boccaccio. Bandello is to Boccaccio as Belloni is to... Girardengo! That is the north star. - You see it? - Yes. Excuse me. The brightest one is Sirius. There, look. Beautiful, so bright! - This brightest one is Venus. - Where is it? I don't see it. I'll show you. It's the one in my arms. As you surely noticed, dear Countess, even if I built this complex just as a game, my beach club has become the best in the area. In your complex, something is still missing. You could've said so right away! What? The rooms? - The rooms are fine. - The kitchen! If something is wrong in the kitchen, I'll have the cooks changed! No. Everything works perfectly. It's the night club. You don't like the night club? I'll have it explode with a bomb! Bravo. It's what we need. But a real bomb, a "bang" bomb! A napalm bomb! No. Your night club has no attraction, no excitement. - It would need... - An earthquake. - No, a "clou". - You could've told me right away! I'll immediately provide for five or six clous! One is enough, but it must be strong, modern. One of those tv clous is needed. They're very much in style. Fine! I'll take care of it. Don't worry. Your every wish is my command. A great show is an attraction for the nearby beaches. I don't give a darn. No, I meant... I don't give a darn about the nearby beaches! I want to do something today that I haven't done since Filippo died. - A swim. - Oh... I've forgotten the effect of salt on my skin. Wow! - Did you say something? - No, I said "Oh, yes"! Countess... I'll go for a swim, too. I will dive in, Countess! Did you see the countess? What a body! - What's her cabin number? - Number 3. - Hurry, the drill! - The drill! - Good morning, Mr. Roberts. - Good morning. You know my friends? No. I've just heard of them. I didn't have the pleasure. - James at the guitar. - Pleased to meet you. Bob, drums. My pleasure. Please have a drink. I'll take Roberts away a minute. Excuse me, Roberts. I must ask you a favor. You must do it, man to man. Have you ever been in love? - Yes, and I still am. - Modestly speaking, so am I! The person I am interested in suggested to add to your very important group the name of a very important star, a woman that should make her debut on August 15. Can you suggest the name of an important star? Why not? She isn't busy on that day. Is she's a real female clou, a very important star? - She's a bomb! - Her name? What is it? I'll tell you in your ear, so my friends won't hear. Tell me. Wow! Bravo, Rocky! You understood me! Bravo! An engineer creates projects, a scientist discovers, but they don't know that in the world some are in great difficulty. To win your heart, now I weigh half as much. I studied very much, much more than at the university. To win your heart, now I weigh half as much. I studied very much, much more than at the university. A philosopher thinks, an astronaut flies, but they don't know that in the world some are in great difficulty. To win your heart, it took me an eternity. I found out that the secret is not to think of you. To win your heart, it took me an eternity. I found out that the secret is not to think of you. Bravo! Bravo! - They are becoming serious. - Dramatic. Look how they're dancing. - She's become a mannequin too. - I think she's in love. No way! She can't prefer him to me. It would be outrageous! - What a bore! - I know. I'm a horrible dancer. - No. The place is boring. - It's a slow evening. On the contrary. Too much noise. I don't like it. Let's go out. - If you like... - Of course. Fabrizio, the professor is stealing your profession. - He's taking Marisa away from you. - He'll take her in a corner. All he can do is talk about Aristotle. - I'll bet they kiss. - Me too. Bet accepted. What silence, what peace! I couldn't stand it in there. At times I want to break off with everyday life. It's not because of me, it is? It could be. Yes, it's true. Maybe it was my anachronistic way of behaving. With poets, philosophers. Soon vacation will be over and we'll return to our lives. When this period ends, I... I will return to my studies, my habits, my students. When summer ends, I am afraid that... I want to tell you that... - I love you, Marisa, and you know it. - Yes, I do. Don't tell me about your emotions. I speak, love and think in an old-fashioned way. An old fogey, as your friends say. - It's not true. - Yes, it is. You, like the others, look for something new that... that may you can't find in a world without scruples where time and reality race by. The day will come when you will be proud of me. You will love me. You'll love me as I love you. That day is already here. It's inside of me. Give me time, and that day will come. You will love me. You will love me. You will love me for what I'm worth. Nothing more. I ask for nothing more. Not even you could stop me. I have the force that love gives. Even if it should cost me much more than what I have. You'll see that I will win your heart. I have the force that love gives. The day will come when you'll be proud of me. You will love me. You'll love me as I love you. Give me time and that day will come. You will love me. You will love me. You will love me for what I'm worth. Nothing more. I ask for nothing more. Not even you could stop me. I have the force that love gives. Even if it should cost me much more than what I have. You'll see that I will win your heart. I have the force that love gives. The day will come when you'll be proud of me. You'll love me. You will love me as I love you. No, Carlo. Let's forget it. We'll just be friends. - What did I tell you? - Alright. You won. Your attention, please! Light! Sorry to interrupt you, but this news is very important. Sunday evening in this hotel, performing for you, will be Lola Falana! Those hole are for giants. - Are they too high? - Panoramic, too. Do we want to show the clients Falana's hair? The eyes want to enjoy the scene. This eye! What do you call it? - Eye! - This transmits. Understand? They must be drilled at the right height. - Where should I drill them? - I'll tell you. At this height is the first row. The second row, half way. - For short people. - You didn't understand a thing. Hole, hole... Drill. Here. Ciccio, we have the stamina of theater impresarios. Tomorrow we'll be sold out and make a bundle of money! Calm down. There is room for everyone. Grand stand. Here's the tonic that perks you up. Please. Grand stand? Here. Here's the tonic that perks you up. Please... Grand stand? Here. Here's the tonic for you.. Good morning, Baron. A hole in the grand stand or parterre? - I don't understand this novelty. - We've gotten organized. We have a gala performance and have 3,000 and 5,000 holes. - It's a matter of price! - It's also a matter of holes. We have holes from the belt on up and holes from the belt... You know. Alright. A place in the parterre. Here. Wait, the tonic. Please. Calm down! Here. You need a lot more. Lieutenant of lifeguards and gold medal for hydraulic valor. You want a cabin? I am always ready to carry out your orders, Miss Falana. For you I am a lifeguard, an admirer and bodyguard. I reserved the best cabin overlooking the sea, with all comforts that I'll show you on site. - Miss Falana is here too. - You don't like her? - For me she's a woman as any other. - I know better ones! - It's all a big setup! - It's no big deal for me. I like her and tonight I hope to have her see stars. Excuse me, excuse me. She's here. She's inside. It's useless. The holes are sold out! Holes are sold out! What are you doing? Southerners! Why are you here? We were just looking if the cabin was in order. - You don't have the keys? - It's occupied. - You were looking in the hole. - Yes. You were spying on her, a trustful client that entrusts us to safeguard of her privacy! Forgive us. It was a moment of weakness. It's not weakness, but just vulgarity. In our cabins, a woman must feel protected like inside an iron curtain. - She isn't a woman. - Is it a man? - Is it a man? - May I know who's inside there? - Lola Falana! - Who is Lola Falana? - The woman who will sing. The one singing at my nightclub! You dare spy on a singer from the hole? Shame on you! Get away from there! Check behind my back. I didn't see anything. It's all black. Of course. She's black. - Then I saw everything... - Yes. Wow! - Go, Fabrizio. - She won't get away, don't worry. - Give me your glasses. - They're women's glasses! - I know! Miss, excuse me. Are these glasses yours? But... - Buy them back. - Alright, I'll buy them back. It's just the first approach. You have to wait. Then you'll see! Please. Would you like to order? Excuse me, miss. I don't know English. I'm sorry. Here. Could you want to point to it? - Boats? - No, no, no! - The director knows English. - She asked for ham and melon. Oh! Right away. Certainly. With pleasure. Professor... so young! - Baron, Dad is here. - On the phone? - No, in the hotel's hall. - In the hall? In the hall. Excuse me! - Thank you. - You're welcome. You're in this delightful place too, huh? - You will like it very much. - I hope so. There are wonderful cabins! I think I'll use them often. I want to swim a lot. - Great! - Fefè! Fefè! Dad! Excuse me, miss. Dad! My dad! They told me you came, and here I am. - You look good. - Well, not so bad. My young falcon! You look good too, old falcon! Tell me. You still like pretty chicks, huh? No. Women don't attract me anymore. I have become skeptical and apathetic towards them. Liar! Big liar! Why did you flirt with your mother? Excuse me, Dad. Do you feel well? Yes, I'm just fine! - I got married yesterday. - What? I decided to spend my honeymoon here. Cecilia, come. Come here. Lovely... - This is your mother. - Is that Fefè? This lovely lady is my mother? Yes, as of yesterday! You're not an orphan anymore. Fefè, we're leaving you. Mom and I are going for a swim. - No! - Why not? - You'd better not. - I say yes! Let's go change. Don't let my mother undress in the cabin. Don't let her undress in the cabin! There are holes... - Guys, where are you going? - To see Falana's rehearsal! - See you later! - Bye. Ever since Falana came, they always dump us. Bye! Bye, guys! Hi, Professor. - Want to go to the beach? - Of course. Look! Woman, from the top of her hair to the perfume of her skin. I feel like a woman more than ever, and I am as you want me. Woman, with good and bad characteristics. I am the one you are looking for, and as you know, I'm all woman. I'm as you want me, as you want me. Some lose their minds to have me! Every day a man is ruined because of me. I don't understand why. I don't understand why. Do you like my song? You sing beautifully, A difficult pronunciation. I can teach you phonetics. I can be at your disposal, even right away. We're not getting anywhere tonight! - A poker game with Luca and Bruno? - So I'll give you another lesson! Fabrizio, Enzo, I'll be right back! I'll advise the others. - What is going on? - Big stuff! - The evening is livening up. - I hope so! Tonight I'll go for it. Tonight I'll go for it. Perfect! I knew you would make it. Tonight I’ll go for it. Tonight I... I am not saying it correctly. The audience will understand. Again. Tonight I'll go for it, I'll go for it... with you. - Where is he? - There. - Are you sure? - I saw them with my own eyes. - I don't believe it. - Types like Carlo are a surprise. - I'll bet you don't even believe it. - I won't bet. I'm not interested. Tonight I'll go for it, tonight I'll go for it... Hello. I'll go for it with you. And I'll do everything to be with you. Maybe you lost a superman. The road that takes to love is long. We both know that. With each step there's a new adventure that can stop us, that can tempt us. For every joy, there was a sorrow. We both know. It is easy to get hurt and not remember what there is between us. We who are nothing when we are divided. In the good and the bad, I want you with me. But the road that takes to love is long. We both know. We'll lose each other who knows how many times, but I will know how to wait for you because you will come back to me. We'll lose each other who knows how many times, but I will know how to wait for you because you will come back to me. Tell me the truth, Marisa. Do you love him? First we say that love isn't something serious, that sentimentalism is idiotic, and the heart is just a muscle. But then we all fall for it like old fogies during their days. Miss Marisa isn't here. She said that the lessons are over. - That way we'll fix Falana up. - It's a perfect plan. - But why are we doing it? - I do it for friendship. Since she's been here, the boys don't bother with us! - Tell me if you don't want to. - Yes, we do. - Then we all agree? - Alright! - Who will do the hit? - I thought of everything. I found the right people, but I need money for an advance. - I have 4,000. - I have 5,000. - The other money? - I'll take care of everything. - Bye! - See you later! The usual place, huh? Bye. - Hi, girls! - Hi! - Did you see the star, Falana? - Are you interested, too? I'm not interested in Miss Falana. She's just the clou attraction of my nightclub! Alright? - Excuse me, sir. - It's crazy! - The lady is in her room. - I'll go right away. I am going to Miss Falana to ask her to sing "Stormy Weather", a song that the countess adores. Jerk! Understand? I am a serious person! - I don't doubt it. - So much the better. Excuse me. Excuse me. Miss Falana? Switchboard, hello. Will you tell Miss Falana that she's wanted in the hall urgently? Thank you. Gas! Gas! It's heavy! Wait. I'll open. Hurry! Put it up. - Have a good trip! - Write when you arrive! - Girls! - Good morning. Mission accomplished. You must give us the money. Here. - It's a promissory note. - It's not money? - What if we don't accept? - We'll report you. We'll accept or they will report us. These daughters of the Giro d'Italia! It expires in five years. Come back! It's crazy! Modern youth! Got that? - It's better to make holes. - It expires in 5 years! Come on! These are the deals you make me do! - Did you see the Commendatore? - No. I've been waiting for him. - Thank you. Excuse me. - You're welcome. - Hey, you! - Occupied. - Did you see the Commendatore? - No, why? - I've looked for him for an hour. - Maybe he's with the countess. No. She hasn't seen him. He went to Falana's room and disappeared. - Find out from the Commendatore. - He's disappeared! He's the one who should know where he is. I hadn't thought of it. - Good evening. Are you in a hurry? - The road is clear. There is a speed limit. You're in an urban area. - We were going 40-45 an hour. - Registration book and license, please. - We weren't speeding. - Yes, alright! You can go, but stay within the speed limit. Be careful. One of the doors is open. - Let's go see. - Good night. - How is it possible? - We didn't close properly. Watch out! - Who put the trunk in here? - Raise it. The door! My gosh! Look here. - Oh, God! A frozen man! - A frozen man? He's alive! Did you want me dead? Oh, God! Oh, God! Lola Falana. Lola Falana! Countess! Countess! Countess! Countess! Countess! Miss Falana! Lola Falana! Countess! Lola Falana! The countess! Lola Falana! A moment of your attention. In such circumstances, words are useless. They are absolutely useless. All I can do is simply say that I have the pleasure of presenting Lola Falana! Then who did we kidnap? The Commendatore! Yes! In the trunk there was a man's weight. Now I remember. - Ciccio, let's run away. I'm afraid. - Be quiet and hold still. - Nobody knows it was us. - Nobody? And the girls? The girls are accomplices. They have to keep quiet. Right, it's true! - Hello, Lola. - Good evening. Thank you! Now I'll sing an Italian song and dance with an Italian gentleman. Me! me! - Will you dance with me? - I'd love to. Tonight I'll go for it, tonight I'll go for it, I'll go for it with you. And I'll do everything, and I'll do everything to be with you. So many times I believed it, but it wasn't so. You looked at everyone except me, and I thought you cared. I've decided to go for it and I'll do something. This time there won't be "ifs". Everyone stop. Now it's my turn! Tonight I'll go for it, I'll go for it with you. And I'll do everything, and I'll do everything to be with you. So many times I believed it, but that wasn't so. Let's leave. Come on. As you wish. Outside there is a lovely starry sky. And I'll do something! This time there won't be "ifs". Everyone stop. Now it's my turn! Tonight I'll go for it! She is leaving. Our game didn't work out. I think it's late. I exaggerated. Thanks just the same. Dance with me! If by chance you don't believe it, it's true, it's true. Since you see me here, it would seem like a "yes". I've decided to go for it, but you must do something too. This time there won't be "ifs". I'm not talking. It's your turn. Tonight I'll go for it. I'll go for it with you! And I'll do everything, I'll do everything to be with you. But now it's your turn, but now it's your turn! What a night! So many stars! Want to see them with the telescope? I know them. That is Sirius, and that is the North Star. - And this is Venus! - Let me go. Don't be silly! - That is the North Star... - Yes, yes, yes. The brightest one... is Sirius. And this one is Venus! - I'll strangle you! - Look! Encore! Encore! - Happy, Nino? - Nino? You know my name? - I know everything about you. - So do I, Eugenia. Countess! Love is wonderful. Yes, but I won't be the countess!
