JOHN: (LAUGHS) I gambled everything on this. SAM ON PHONE: (SIGHS) I can't justify the investment, John. JOHN: I've been at the convention for four days and the booth has been busy. I've got people coming in and out all day long. SAM: Kids may want to play with it, John, but no one is going to spend $3000 on a toy. JOHN: This program is for everyone. Modem technology is just beginning to... No, John, it isn't. It's over. (JOHN SIGHS IN EXASPERATION) SAM: We're shutting the system down. You can't do this! We've pulled the plug. You're offline. Sam, I've worked too long on this. I've put my family's entire savings into this. I didn't tell you to do that. It's over, John. Check out of that hotel and go home. Sam... (LINE DISCONNECTS) Sam?

(MUFFLED SPEAKING) (TYPING) (WHISTLING) (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING) ANNOUNCER: Welcome everyone to ViewCon. The conference is now open! (CROWD CHEERING) (SCREAMING) What's up, ViewCon, it's your girl, AKAshley. I have arrived and with my squad for the weekend. Say, "What's up," Kara. Hi, we don't normally look this tired, I promise. And this is my muscles for the weekend... Yeah, I have a security guard. 'Cause that's how I'm gonna roll. This is... I'm Larry. Super serious, super cute, potentially not actually a security guard... (WHISPERS) That's Kara's doing! ...for the weekend, but we are here, so don't mess with us, 'cause this is the squad you wanna watch out for. Speaking of "watching out for," I'm gonna see you guys today, tomorrow, whenever this video goes up. And I am so excited, I have a panel. Kara, it's at... Today at 11:00. Today at 11:00, she says, so see us there. Can't wait, maybe you'll even be in this video, plus AKAshley, peace out. (MESSAGE ALERTS BEEPING) What up, what up, what up, it is day one at ViewCon, and I have some very exciting news to share with you guys, like, "Whoa," like you're gonna die. Look who it is! Hey! Hi! Everyone's just like... KYLIE: Seriously, it's insane! Are you going to the... World Screen Party? Duh! What are you gonna wear? I don't know. Maybe just sweat pants. I don't care. No, you're gonna wear a dress and look amazing. I'm amazing. (LAUGHS) Okay, I'm this way. MEGAN: Oh! Hi, Mark. Oh, hi. How do I look? Oh, you look amazing. I've ordered 200 of these and they sent me 500! Oh, my God. What am I gonna do? Give them away! Huh, do you guys want it? They want the give away! Oh, you're a legend. We already know that. Deuces, guys! See ya. (ELEVATOR WHIRRING) (CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS) Oh. Sweet! Thank you. She's gonna love it. Anytime, dude. (AUTOMATED VOICE SPEAKING) Floor nine. Have a nice day. (EXCITEDLY) Oh, my God! It is really you? (SQUEALS) Ah! It's really you. I love you. GIRL: Oh, my God! Are you staying on this floor? No, she's staying in a different hotel. We... (CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS) Can we take a selfie? Sure. Yeah. One more. Say, "safety." (LAUGHS) Safety. KARA: Okay, we gotta go. Sorry. We'll see you at the place. GIRL: Bye. LARRY: All right, ma'am, this is gonna be your room, right up here on the left. (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING LOUDLY) (MARK SHOUTING) MARK:...you're gonna be Instagram and baby, let's go, ViewCon! (KEYCARD CLICKS) Whoa, hey, yo! You guys scared me. I was expecting some French fries from room service but, I guess I ordered an Ashley party instead. Yo, come in. Let's live like we're gonna die young. Excuse me, sir, this is actually this young lady's room. Uh, excuse me, Larry. This is my room. I have a key and itinerary and I already brushed my teeth twice, so, yeah. This is my room. (GIRL TALKING INDISTINCTLY IN ROOM) Shit, they seriously double booked this. Okay, sorry, Mark, we gotta go back down. Can you take us a different way? How are the rooms? The AC's good, but the Wi-Fi sucks. So, good luck uploading. All right. KARA: Okay, we gotta go. Come on. MARK: Bye, guys. (TYPING) KARA: No, she's supposed to have a king apartment suite. I am truly sorry, but we are completely full at the moment. KARA: No... Now, I do have your gift baskets for you here. CONCIERGE: And I can offer you a voucher for a future stay. KARA: No. I could also suggest some other hotels in the area that might be able to accommodate you. KARA: No, you can't. KARA: Give my client a suite like it says in her contract, okay. I have the confirmation right here on my phone. She has six million subs. Just kick out a Snapchat star or something. Our apologies for the inconvenience, ma'am. As you can see, we are abnormally busy because of the conference, but we would be very happy to help you make other arrangements. No, just let me speak to your manager. I am the manager. Okay, then, fix it. Please. (TYPING) Oh, would you look at that? A suite just opened up. It must be your lucky day. 2210 A, just became available. Guys, we're good. (WHISPERING) Really, I didn't think that we... Would you just, chill a bit, please. Okay. How many keys would your Internet client require? KARA: Two's fine. Thanks. Great. Two. No, just give it. KARA: The bags. Move, Steven. (ELEVATOR DINGS) AUTOMATED VOICE SPEAKING: Floor 22. Have a nice day. ASHLEY: You can be such a bitch sometimes. KARA: Well, it worked, didn't it? ASHLEY: I'm not complaining. I love it. Where are you staying tonight? You can crash with me. KARA: I'm at the Double Tree. I think it's really close. Wait, isn't that the room? LARRY: That's 2210, you're 2210A. I know I shouldn't be saying this, but, the Double Tree is a better hotel, much better. STEVEN: You'll both enjoy staying there. They recently replaced their mattresses, their pool's nice... KARA: Open the door, before someone sees her, please? One moment. (KEYCARD CLICKS) (DOOR RATTLES) (STEVEN GRUNTS) (DOOR CREAKS) STEVEN: Okay, after you, ma'am. KARA: Wait, you should really vlog this here. (DEVICE BEEPS) Oh, God, look at this room! This is my suite, ladies and gentlemen. ASHLEY: Who wants a tour? Okay, this is my big bed, so... Dwayne Johnson, my boy, if you see this before Sunday, there is room for two. So come on over. Let's see what we got over here. I love it. Walk-in closet! Okay, celeb treatment, am I right, ladies! Let's talk about two things really quick. One: Who actually unpacks everything and hangs it up in here? I'm living that 'straight out of the suitcase' life. And two: It's below freezing in here. Like seriously, so cold. (SWITCHES LIGHT OFF) KARA: Thank God we didn't tip his ass. Preach! What's up? KARA: (SIGHS) He just left the gift basket on the floor! All right, you good? I'm gonna check into my hotel and take a shower and have a cocktail. I know we were talking before but like maybe... No. You can't quit. I don't know, I just thought that like maybe I could... take a break and then... Look, let's get through the next three days, finish your book, and then we'll figure out a chill-out situation after that. Okay? Hey, you'll be fine. I promise. Ooh, look. (PAPER RUSTLING) There's this. (CHUCKLES) Huh? (SCOFFS) Oh, it's a sign. We have your panel at 11:00, and then we have that secret tweet up at 3:00 and then, other than that, do your thing. And then we announce your tour on Sunday and then we're out. Okay, love you. Bye. Love you. Bye. (DOOR OPENS) (SINISTER MUSIC PLAYING) (TYPING) Aww, little nugget. So this is our first pair... (MESSAGE ALERTS) ...and then, our second option look like this. These are creepers. Super adorable, surprisingly very comfortable, and uh, they don't make your feet stink. So, if you guys want me to wear these all day... (MESSAGE ALERTS CONTINUE) ...then just write "222" and I'll wear them. It's that easy. (KNOCK AT DOOR) Room service, be right back. Go get in line for the meet and greet. It's in the main room of the convention center. There's already a line forming, and I'm going to be there in eight minutes. So, hurry up. Bye, guys. (SINGSONG) Coming. Hello, hello, hello. (CHUCKLES) Hi. (BOTH CHUCKLING) Did anybody see you? Yeah, everybody. I screamed your name down the entire hall. I am serious. Hmm. I know. It's cute. Which floor you on? Nine. I was hoping that I could crash here. If you'll let me. Yeah. I decided to spend the whole weekend with you. Um... What? It's still a little weird for me. It's not totally over, over. Yeah, but you're gonna break up with him? Yeah. Yeah. It's over, over, right? Yeah, no, I just haven't had a chance to, yet. I'm sorry. Don't be mad. I mean, he's in Miami, and we're both right here. So, let's take our clothes off and celebrate. (CHUCKLES) Hmm? Mmm-hmm. (MESSAGE ALERT) Mmm. Shit! Okay, I gotta go. We barely know each other, right? Yeah, we're strangers. We never hung out. I'll count to 100 after you leave and then I'll sneak out. I get it. It's complicated. See ya. I only know you from your channel. (CHILD LAUGHING IN DISTANCE) (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING) (PEOPLE TALKING INDISTINCTLY) So how did you begin? Honestly, it all started with just me alone in my bedroom, with a camera and a laptop. I've already met so many of you guys, and it has been so crazy... Hey, girl. Hi. Keep moving. So, are you going to the party tonight? MEGAN: Uh, I think so. I don't know. I still have to unpack. There's this web series thing. Could be cool. Wanted to talk to you about it. Ooh. Let's hang out soon. Perfect. Let's take a selfie quick. (CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS) Cute. MEGAN: I love it. Okay, text me if you go. Oh, hey. Hey. How are you? It's Megan, right? Yeah. You know, I had no idea that you were gonna be here. And I love that new hair color on you. (INAUDIBLE) ANNOUNCER: Hey, ViewCon, are you ready to get crazy? You all know AKAshley. (CROWD CHEERING) She's got over four million followers. Our first guest is her manager. KARA: Hey, ViewCon, so excited to be here. For real though, you're gonna get so many new clients this weekend. You're the only one who knew what they were talking about up there. I was like sweating like crazy. Did I have pit stains? ASHLEY: You don't stink. Oh, good. GIRL: OMG. Oh, my God, it's Ashley. (GIRLS GIGGLING) Again, Taco Bell. Are you good? (SIGHS) (CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING) Um, no. (MESSAGE ALERTS) Ashley, you gotta snap out of it. They're actually just trying to get a selfie with me for Instagram likes. They worship you. You're not listening. I'm serious. After this weekend, I'm done. I'm disappearing to the middle of nowhere, where there is no Wi-Fi. Okay, great. Where? The Swiss Alps? Don't be ridiculous, Ashley, okay? They love you. (CAMERAS FLASHING) Take care of it. GIRL: Is that Ashley? Ashley, this is your...Ash... GIRL: Yeah, it's her. I'm her biggest fan. (GIRLS SCREAMING EXCITEDLY) (ELEVATOR DINGS) GIRL: OMG! It's Ashley! (CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS) Yeah. Mmm-hmm, I'm actually almost there. I know, I'm so excited. (TYPING) Mmm-hmm. Yeah, it's gonna be so much fun. AUTOMATED VOICE SPEAKING: Floor nine. Have a nice day. Mmm-hmm. I know. I will text you when I get there. (ELEVATOR DOOR CLOSES) (EXHALES) (AUTOMATED VOICE MESSAGE) Floor 22. (ELEVATOR DINGS) Have a nice day. (KEYCARD CLICKS) Dude. (TYPING) (VIDEO RECORDER BEEPS) Hey, guys, so I had a great day at ViewCon. And I just got to my hotel room and it's completely trashed. This is literally all of my stuff, all over the floor. Someone just decided to go through it, and put it everywhere, which makes complete sense. They ate all of my candy. (WRAPPERS RUSTLING) There's wrappers that I'm currently stepping on, all over my floor. (MESSAGE ALERTS) Okay, the bathroom's trashed, too, so that's just great. Oh, wow! Like, who does this? It's my favorite lipstick. I was gonna rock that shade all weekend. All my stuff's everywhere. My goodie bag's gone. So, if you have any idea who did this, feel free to tweet me, and call security, I'll call security, whatever, I don't know, okay. (SIGHS) (PHONE THUDS) (SLURPS) (PHONE RINGS) Hello. (DISTORTED ELECTRONIC VOICE) Please choose an activity. Uh, no comprende. I didn't order room service. Please choose an activity. Who is this? Please choose an activity. Mark? Please choose an activity. Please choose... Oh, God. (DOORKNOB RATTLING) (EERIE MUSIC PLAYING) (DOORKNOB RATTLING) Hello? (RATTLING) Hey, girl. Are you all right? Oh, my God. You scared the shit out of me. I just... I called security, they're gonna come up. KARA: But don't leave this door open, or you'll have like a hundred teenagers in here. LARRY: There's no sign of forced entry. Anything of value missing? (DISTANT SCRUBBING) ASHLEY: Um, no, honestly, just candy and makeup. Are you sure? ASHLEY: Yeah, I mean, I have my laptop and my cameras and all. Do you have any keycards of anybody else? Like a friend or a boyfriend? ASHLEY: No, it's just me. Wha... Is this happening in other rooms? (MESSAGE ALERT) Not that I'm aware. (LARRY SIGHS) You can file a report if you want to, but if nothing's missing, there's not really much we can do about it. It's probably just some fans wanting to take your room for a joyride. The best bet, just double these doors are shut when you leave. They're kind of old, so they stick if you don't really pull them shut. (LARRY SIGHS) But just to be safe, let me take those keycards from you. Get them switched out. Mmm-hmm. Oh, okay. Thank you. (VIDEO GAME CHATTER) DAVE: Hey, gamers, got a little special for you here today. I hope you're enjoying ViewCon. I hope you're enjoying the weekend. I'm enjoying my lavish suite, doing what I do best... (RAPIDLY PRESSING BUTTONS) ...hiding in the dark room playing my games, trying to score the highest level. I'll be streaming all weekend, so keep it locked here with the groupers. (SCREECHES) LARRY: How's it going there, Warren? How's it going, Larry? Oh, you know, same ole, same ole. Just a bunch of kids going wild. Hey, can you scan a couple of these for me? Room 2210A. They put guests in there? We got guests everywhere, Warren. It's ViewCon, baby. I got Internet stars coming out of my... Butt. You got a family in there? Oh, no. One of the Internet kids from the conference. (TYPING) Somebody trashed her room pretty good, though. Nothing stolen, but can't be too careful. (KEYCARD BEEPS) Listen, really, why don't you take a load off? I can run these up for you. I'm off in 15, and I can just stop by on the way out. No, don't sweat it, Warren. (SNIFFS) (SINISTER MUSIC PLAYING) (WHISTLING) (CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS) (RECORDER BEEPS) (SIGHS) Day 1 of ViewCon started out hella awesome and ended hella dumb. So, I'm sorry if I sound really upset in this vlog. I don't want to bring you guys down. Just remember, tomorrow's a new day, and I'm gonna be all good, so, you should too. If you're at ViewCon, make sure to check out my schedule down below and give this video a thumbs up to spread that AKAshley love, and I'll see you guys next time because it's bubble bath time. (BEEPING) (SINISTER MUSIC PLAYING) (WATER RUNNING) (CREAKING) (ELECTRICAL BUZZ) I mean, this whole hotel's kinda shitty. Like, nothing in my room works. Right, these lights... (SWITCHING ON AND OFF) Nothing. Hmm. Also no TV, it's so weird. Hey, can I tell you something? Like, you can't tell anyone. Yeah. Are you okay? Uh... I don't know, I think I might break it off with Ricky. (GASPS) Wait, what happen? Nothing. Nothing, he didn't do anything, but, I don't know, he's the sweetest guy, we're always traveling and we're never together, and I don't know. You don't know what? I've sort of kind of been seeing Dave too. What! No! Yeah. That's crazy. But, I didn't even know you guys hang out. No, I mean, it just started. I feel crazy. (SIGHS) (BOTH CHUCKLE SOFTLY) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING) MEGAN: I'm the worst. (KYLIE TYPING) Right, like I'm a bad person. No! Not at all. You just like somebody more. It'll be more mistake you stay with someone that you don't want to be with. Yeah. It'll work out, okay. You're fine. (MEGAN SMILES) And I mean, I get it, Dave's definitely special. Like you guys make more sense as a couple. MEGAN: Right? Okay, totally. Yeah! I don't know, I just feel like... (THUDS) (KYLIE SCREAMS) I'm sorry. What was that? Just go and knock on it. Really hard. Like, who's staying over there? I don't know. Who even does that? Just open the door and scream at them. MEGAN: I'm not going over there. Okay, fine, I'll go. (THUDS) (SCREAMS) Oh, my God! It's not even funny! (EERIE MUSIC PLAYING) (WHITE NOISE) The computer just asked me if I want to log on. Now it's telling me to phone up the computer. (DIALING) Now, there is a virtual place. (SINISTER SCREAMS) (GASPS) (PANTING) (KNOCK AT DOOR) MEGAN: Hey, I'm from next door, are you okay? Oh, Ashley. Hey, you heard that, right? It was like crazy loud. Yeah, I thought the door was gonna break in half. MEGAN: Sure it wasn't you? ASHLEY: Yeah, I'm sure. Is your room like abnormally cold? Yeah, not really. (GIRLS SCREAMING) I should get back to my room. If you want, you can come out and hang out with Kylie and I. Uh, no, thanks, I'm honestly exhausted. But, uh, I'll see you guys tomorrow night, right? Yeah. Yeah, definitely. You should hurry. Bye. Yeah. Bye. GIRL: Oh, my gosh, it's Megan! (LOCKS DOOR) (GIRLS LAUGHING) (KNOCK AT DOOR) ASHLEY: Go away!

Okay, so we won't see each other for a little while, and I was thinking maybe we could film us? Film us? Like, hooking up, filming us? Yeah, but you can keep it. Like, you can control it for when we're not together. You know, I thought it might be hot, and kind of fun. Hmm. Sorry, you're mad. No. No, no, no, I'm not mad. Um... It just, no, it'd be fun but no, I can't. Yeah. Let's just Snap for now. I'm not trying to be the next... Okay, right. Sorry, I'm an idiot. Yeah. It's so stupid. No, you're not an idiot. You're just horny. Hmm. Okay. It's not out of the question. Hmm? I think I'm the one who tastes like French fries. Definitely. Right. Yeah, I'm gonna go brush my teeth. Hmm. (SOFT CHUCKLE) (TAP OPENS, WATER RUNNING) (UNZIPS) (RUMMAGING) (GLASS CLINKS) (WATER RUNNING, TAP SHUTS) What are you doing? I found this on the floor. Who is this little dude? I don't know. This place is a dump. Maybe a guest left it. He's kind of cute though. Look at that little haircut. (DAVE CHUCKLES) Wait. Oh, my God! What?

And I've got like two hours of sleep. (MUSIC PLAYING) Ashley missed her first panel. And now, she's not answering her phone. So fun. She's probably just hiding up in her room. It's what I want to do right now. GIRL: Ashley gets her shoes off! She's starting a new trend! GIRL: Trending Hashtag shoes off! (KIDS GIGGLING) (CAMERAS CLICKING) GIRL: I'm gonna take my shoes off, just like Ashley. I mean, between you and me, she's kind of in a weird place. Not super happy with all of this. Man, that sucks. Yeah. Well, I'll keep an eye out for her and I'm good at finding people. KARA: Oh! Okay. Thank you. See you tonight. (CAMERAS CLICKING) GIRL: Oh, my God! It's AKAshley! Hello. Can I take a picture with you? (CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS) I can't believe it's you. I love you. Thank you. JESSIE: Ashley, hey. Kara's looking for you. JESSIE: Kara. Yeah. I found her. Where were you?

Ashley, are you... (SOFTLY) Are you drunk of something? Tell me what to do. This is a really big day for us. Are you sure you're all right? Yeah. I love it here. It's perfect. She all ready to go?

What's the matter with you? This is usually the part you like the most. I'm sick. No, you're hungover. Why don't you just go puke and come right back? Give all these people a photo. They've waited for hours. I'm almost done. Yeah. Just two more, then you can do whatever. Come on, put your shoes on. Ash? Hi. Two more days, okay? (FANS SCREAMING) Just go. I'll stall.

What the hell are you doing with my daughter? Hi. Thank God. She must have wandered off. I was taking her to security because I thought she was lost. -WOMAN: Thank God. -Happy to help. WOMAN: You can't do that. You have to stay where I can see you at all times. You know that. But we were gonna play hide and seek. WOMAN: Come on. Let's go. (EXHALES) What the frig? All right, you guys, so this is what I actually want to wear at every single industry party. But I don't think any brands want this as their spokesperson, which I honestly don't understand. Because, come on, you guys, it's so cute. Also, very comfortable. And lastly, you don't have to shave your legs to look good in this one. Because, you know, sometimes, being a girl, not that fun. But actually, I do have one last option underneath. It's a little skirt and top combo. Oh, so foxy. Little more risque, shows a little bit more skin, -but... -(KNOCK ON DOOR) Uh, vote at me, comment at me, subscribe to my channel and tweet at me. I'll post the winning look on my Instagram and Snapchat in about an hour. And I'll see you guys later. -(KNOCKING ON DOOR) -One sec. -RICKY: Surprise! -Oh. Hi. Ricky, what are you doing here? Your face is exactly what I hoped it looked like when you open the door. -Uh, what are you doing here? -Nice room. Seriously, why didn't you tell me you were coming? Sorry, it's called a surprise. No, it's sweet. (CELL PHONE CHIMES) (SLOW MUSIC PLAYING) (SIGHS) What is this? -Are you cheating on me? -What? At least you used protection. Like, a lot of protection. That is so cute. Oh babe, my place in Miami is so dope. I wanna buy it. Wait. First, let's do a quick little selfie. Okay? -(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS) -Ooh! Done. Daddy likes this. -(CELL PHONE CHIMES) -(MUSIC CONTINUES) See you down there. All right, I'll text you. All right, you dummy. I'll be here. Hello, room service. This better be Egyptian cotton.
