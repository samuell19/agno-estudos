The ones who lose wars by the skin of their teeth. Oh, yeah. The ones who say, "Everything is wrong here." The ones who say, "Now let's all have a good laugh." Oh, yeah. What the hell? - My God! - Jesus! Jesus! Why, you're Italian. And you? Who are you? - Were you on that train? - Damn right I was. Damned, miserable woods. You scared me to death. These Germans, first they shoot and then ask, "Who's there?" You're telling me. Maybe you can tell me where the hell we are. I'd say it's Germany. Anyway, what I say is, we're better off here than on the train. - That's for sure. - That train is a blast furnace. Poor bastards. Yes, poor them. You know, I'm not really wounded. I've got to be a deserter, or worse, by now. Worse. No doubt about that. Faking a wound... But anyway... It's pretty good. It looks real, my lad. I saved myself, but I was helped out by a dead man, may his soul rest in peace. With all due respect for the dead, I had to take his bandages. Instead of being in Stalingrad, I'm here. So I said to my men, where are we going? What are we doing, running around like this? Who wants to go around killing? Let's go. Go back home. You can't work for people who send you with cardboard shoes. Here, where when you blow your nose you get a crystal chandelier and when you shit you get icicles. So I grabbed two trucks and sent the men home. I hope they made it. They would have had me shot tomorrow. I hate the military courts here. How long is this river? It must be the Rhine. - Where is that? - It's still in Germany. Then it's still a pain in the ass. Damn! Who were they? Maybe they are the Jews. - That's impossible. - It's possible. And we're as guilty as they are. We're accomplices to those rotten shits. Why do you think that we're accomplices? Because we didn't make a sound, didn't come out and spit in their faces. We could have, but we ran instead. That's crazy. How could we have? They'd have come after us and we'd be shot. Useless suicide. No, it wouldn't have been useless because in the face of certain things you've got to say no, and instead I said yes to Mussolini, to duty and to all that crap. In this war I've killed bastards I didn't even know. I killed before the war, but I had my reasons. I kill like an idiot, for no reason. I did it for a woman. I killed for a woman. A woman... Mama, mama, mama Mia What a bad thing is jealousy Tell Marianna she seems an old bag How much you have to sanction me What a funny trick The fascist Italy under sanction They want to give us such a slap I do not care a rap about sanctions I feel better alone Than accompanied badly I am a real beauty Since I was sanctioned Oh, pretty sanction Shit, coffee Mess, mess, mess No sanction, no more Milò, I'll make Who blows a raspberry - She must be kidding! - What more do you want? Screw off! Let's see you dance! Walking cow! Screw off! Drop dead! How about letting me tickle you all over? You can tickle your mama! I'll give you something, so don't push. Nothing easy about me! - What a lass! - We want more! What do you want me to do? There! There! Give us more! Take it off! Come on! Forget it! Fuck you! There! There! - Pasqualino. - Let's talk, Concetti. Look at yourself in the mirror. Go on! Take a look at yourself! Are you pretty? No, you're not pretty. You're not even intelligent. Among Mom and our sisters there isn't a penny. I'm the only man in the house with eight women. There's one thing I've tried to defend. One thing! Our honor! To protect and defend that honor as best I can. Not being the biggest or strongest man in the world, I carry this thing around, I wear this gun. They know about it and they have to respect us. And you ugly, miserable pig put your disgusting thighs on display in a musical... because that lousy rat said he'd make you famous. That filthy bastard who helped to get you started and gave you this job... - I'll kill him. - No! I'll shoot him. You mustn't! I beg you! He'll marry me! He promised! I'm going on 37. I'll be a spinster! Better a spinster than a whore! I must kill him. No! Potono will marry me! First he'll make me somebody, then his bride. Somebody! Somebody? Come on. Look at yourself. A squawking crow. Didn't you hear them? Disgraceful! What a shame! I'll kill that Potono! No! I'm through! I have a much better contract. He'll help me sing at Club Margarita, then he'll marry me. He made me a promise. He loves me very much. One month, eh? I give him one month to straighten things up. One month! Our house mustn't be dishonored. You understand, idiot? Understand? Imagine the eldest becoming a whore. What will the others do? Become whores? He's got a month... to marry you... or I'll kill him. The word of Pasqualino Seven Beauties. Do you understand? Rosina, my carnation. Coming right up, Pasqualino. Damn Francesco. After all this time in Africa, now they're sending him to Spain. We need another war? It wasn't enough last time? Now we'll never get married! Don't give up hope. Because with God's help he may still be lucky enough to get a nice wound in his leg or his arm. You'd get a pension for life and you'd be set. - What? - Or he'll lose an eye. What crazy talk, Mama! Hey, Mama, we don't enjoy such lucky accidents in our family. Yes, of course. It will pass. Grandma. Rough up those mattresses. Pasqualino, leave it in the drawer. Are you looking for trouble? Hey, Mama, it doesn't get you into trouble. They learn to fear you and respect you. And believe me, they all respect me. Excuse us for a moment. Family business. You'll pardon us? - He needs to talk in private. - It's business. - It's a big secret. - Who gives a damn? Quiet. You can't trust them to lick Leno's family. Is that clear? Mama. Look. Money to buy groceries. Lucky Mama. I'm sick of bread and onions. Buy an egg for each one of you. And beware of cheats. It'd disgust anybody to look at such yellow faces. There's a lot to be done if they're ever to get married. Stop that! Now, listen to me. Don't let anybody see your eyes. Look down. Or you may be taken for a cheap tart. And I'll beat the first one who misbehaves. Remember. Smile. No reason to be upset like that. Cheer up. Have a good day. And you too, Louiselle. And you too, hmm? Don't look so gloomy, eh? Smile for a change! What's the matter with you? What the hell do you think you're doing? Don't stop singing! We need the money! Understand? Go on, sing! You, get going! Little girl, have your parrot tell my fortune. - Why the tears? - It's my mother's fault. I never could sing. I go off pitch. To make me sing is wrong. But it doesn't matter. You can yell. The men bother me. They make fun and tease. Can't you answer back? If anyone fails to respect you, you just say you're my fiancée. Like this. Say you're engaged to Pasqualino Seven Beauties. But I'm not your fiancée. It's false. At the moment. But in a few years things could happen. Never try to predict the weather or the future. Think about growing up. Say, come on. Try. To get by Even you started stealing from the cradle. Jealousy is an ugly thing. Excuse me, Don Raphael. I don't understand. What's the matter? I've always been loyal. It's not about loyalty. I'm interested in people who know how to show respect. What are you talking about? What are you referring to? I'll tell you what I'm referring to. I'm talking about someone who doesn't respect his family. - In what sense? - I'll tell you. At three o'clock you'd better be at the Polonetto. Look around. See what they're doing to you. Potono bought your sister a pair of shoes with red bows on them and put her in there for life. We have a client. My God! It's my brother! - Who is he? - It's her brother! Prostitute! Stupid bitch! Are you satisfied now? Your fiancé got you into this business? Idiot! What a disgrace! You brought dishonor on us! Let go! Get the hell out of my way! Tell me where he is. Or I'll murder you. Do you hear me? How do I find that son of a bitch? I can't breathe. Let go of my throat first. This is how he married you, that lousy bastard? Disgracing our house! Where is he? Right here. Filth! Go home! - How can I, dressed this way? - Take this. Go like this. Go home! No, Pasqualino! No! Don't kill him! I love him! Please! Screw you and your love! Idiot! Eighteen-Karat Potono, is that you? Damn right. Weren't you going to marry my sister, Concettina? You promised and therefore you'll marry her. Who are you? Who the hell do you think you are? Miserable worm. Get out. I didn't understand. Does that help you understand? Have a good day. - Poor boy. - Will he be all right? Get that mess out of here. We've got customers. Where is he? Where is he? Where'd that rotten son of a bitch go? It's really not worth bothering about. Isn't it? I'm going to chop his head off. Scum, humiliating me. He won't live long. Eighteen-Karat Potono... wake up! I don't like killing a man while he's sleeping. Come on, wake up. Wake up! It's me. No! Jesus! Don't shoot! You're the one who caused it. You called me "miserable worm." Remember? Find that pistol. I need it. Find it and be quick! It's important to my defense. Shit. He's dead. Where the hell are we? Jesus. What... I smell onions. Signora. Good morning, good morning. Excuse me for coming in without permission. Stay quiet. Sorry to disturb, but I'm hungry. I'm an Italian soldier. Understand? No? That's okay, German lady. Oh, something to eat. Italian soldier, Naples. Sunshine, blue water, mandolins. Understand? A pizza pie with tomatoes on top, or macaroni. There's food in here. I'm starving! Ah, German soup! Nice. Good and hot. Signora, I'm hungry. I'll have some bread, with your permission. Oh, bread with stew. It's so good. Our mama often gave us stew in Naples. A mama, signora, is never forgotten. You're a mother too. Isn't your daughter cold with her ass sticking out like that? Hard times, signora. The war's been responsible. Shit, if someone's there, I... No, it's all right. Soup, bread... potatoes... I'm taking some bread for my friend. He's Italian. This is for him. A drop of wine. Salute. Good wine. Good. I'd like to be your guest. Your daughter has a great ass. But I have to run. Thank you. May you live to be a hundred. Oh, salami. Salami and some cheese. Thank you! You're welcome! Until we meet again! Good night, signora. What's that about? Groundsport. A mysterious word, amigo. We must work occasionally, or else... acid bath. Or crematorium. - How do you know? Who are you? - That's the way it is. I'm a death expert. I know an anarchist whose bombs didn't work. Mussolini, Hitler, Salazar. I've got failure after failure. These people have made a business out of death. That goddamn rotten whore. What's the world coming to? How the hell did the world ever get like this? And we let ourselves get killed this way. Nobody says anything. The Jews, who were supposed to be so smart. The brave Russians, who began the revolution. They're not rebelling. My rotten luck, ending up in this shit pile. Jesus. They're playing a waltz. My God. My God. Like sheep about to be slaughtered. It can't be. Francesco, I don't want to die. I can't accept that. I'm still young. I had a miserable life. I would like to have changed it, but I never managed to. I can't die like this. I just can't die like this. I'll try and get out of here. I'll do it. I'll find a way out of here, starting at this moment. A woman is a woman, Pasqualino. And a woman, even one who is an evil person, has a little good for someone who can reach her heart. There's a bit of sugar always there. The song goes... In a cup of coffee, Rosalie Ugly to take, unsavory Sugar, burnt and wasting can make it distasteful So I must stir her up Like sugar in the cup To bring to my lips what's sweet and fine You're crazy, Pasqualino. Yes, but I must try. It's dangerous. She's cruel, sadistic. I understand all that. But I had a vision. Something my mama said. That bit of sugar, I know it's there. No matter how rotten she is, or how evil, she must need love. I'm right, Franche. You're educated, but in the matter of women I'm way ahead of you. I'm sure. You know what I used to be called? Pasqualino Seven Beauties. - They did? - Yes, because I'm ugly. You look terrible, all right. But that was the point. In spite of my looks, I appealed to women. They loved me. People were amazed. They'd say, "It's unbelievable. He's repulsive." Others replied, "He must have the Seven Beauties." That's how it came to be my name, see? No, but I believe you. I appeal to the ladies. I used to appeal to them. The fact is, without exaggeration, I haven't looked in a mirror in years. Since I know, from the beginning, that I'm an ugly man, I'll admit it's been bothering me. How did I turn out like this? My teeth have become loose. I can't keep my eyes open. My ass has dropped. Look at me and tell me honestly, how do I look? Awful, to be quite honest. I'd forget it. No! I'm bound to be killed. So why not? I want to live, have children, see my children's children, and more, the children of my children's children. All the children I can possibly have. What bullshit, amigo. You pig! How dare you tell me what to do? How dare you insult me like that? Come on. That's nonsense. You're talking bullshit. Piss off. Because the more children you have, the faster the end will come. In what sense? Exactly what do you mean? In the year 1400 there were 500 million people on earth. By the year 1850 the amount had doubled to one billion. Now we're all... extremely indignant because of the death of 20 million men. But in 200 or 300 years, there'll be a lot more of us, 30 billion more. So anywhere you go on earth will be worse than here. That's when men are going to butcher one another and murder an entire family for a piece of bread or an apple... and the world will end. Too bad, because I believe in man. But soon... very soon a new man... a new man will be born. He'll have to be civilized. Not this beast who's been endowed with intelligence and obliterated the harmony in the world and brought about total destruction just by disturbing nature's equilibrium. A new man... able to rediscover the harmony that's within. You mean, put things in order? Order? No, no, no, no, no. The orderly ones are the Germans. A new man in disorder... is our only hope. A new man... in disorder. You made a mistake, boy. You made a mistake. You should have waited until he got his revolver out. I waited about five minutes, but he didn't have a gun around. He didn't have a weapon. You shouldn't have shot him. - You should have given Potono a gun. - I only had one. You should've had two with you. In certain cases, you must take precautions. This case demanded the simplest of care. You must prepare for the job. You should throw him his gun, defend yourself. He picks up the gun, you shoot him. You didn't murder him. Self-defense. Later on, the case comes up, a quick trial. In no time you're out and you're respected. It's a breeze. Get it? Don Raphael, how could I have known? A real man prepares a job with foresight. Or else anyone at all would be able to do it. Now you've got the problem of making it all disappear. Fifty percent is all you can hope to get out of it morally. I'm talking about respect. You must make yourself a name. You need lots of publicity. For this you need discretion. The man's on a trip now. He's gone to America. It's a supposition, but we must be sure. - He's disappeared. - Sounds simple. How am I to fix it? Throw him in the bay? It'll rise to the top and you'll go straight to prison. Marvelous. Perfect. Damn it! Dear God. Imagination. A creative effort's needed. Easy, no? Like smoking a cigarette. Smoking cigarettes, anybody can do that. The man who wants to be something more... needs the guts to perform. The nerve to do things that normally no one else could possibly imagine. Get the point? I get the point, Don Raphael. You seem nervous, my boy. - Calm down. - I am calm. There are men who, at the very mention of their name, make the whole world tremble. - Get my point, Pasqualino? - I get it. You're intelligent. You follow everything I tell you. I follow, Don Raphael. As I explained, you could make a great start for yourself with this opportunity. Or not. Of course, it's entirely up to you. Potono has to disappear. Don't pay attention to anyone who talks about the American system. Traditional cement shoes were invented here in Sicily. Chicago and New York just make cheap imitations. It's plagiarism. The king-size coffin is our invention. When you see a funeral in Naples, nobody knows how many bodies are in the coffin. When things get busy, two or three can be stuffed in. Depends on the demand. We invented everything here in Naples. For example, you know the ancient graveyard? Well, when they first opened it they found 500 skeletons. Now there are 5,000. The question is, who put the other 4,500 in there? So, as I said, it depends on the demand. Oh, God. He's so ugly. Wait a minute here. Son of a bitch. Even dead, you are a pig. Just a big bag of wind. I knew it. Fuck! Who's there? Who is it? Who are you? Who is it? Who's there? What's going on? Who's there? What's going on? Fido, what's going on? What's happening? - Get going. - Where to? To the station. And hurry. Damn stupid animal! Blind idiot! You should be ashamed of yourself! You have no respect for a poor blind man! Son of a bitch! What is this? Stay back! Keep your hands off me, please! Get back! Will you get back! I don't want any help! I'll manage myself. I don't need help. Please. - I can manage myself. - He's so strong. Look! A big cheese box roped up wrong. Could you please take these? Thanks. How did you wrap it? Watch out. Handle it carefully. - Where are you going? - Palermo, Milano and Genoa. You know that shipment of provolone? It's been sent off. Palermo, Milano and Genoa. Good-bye. It was your advice I followed about creative thinking. I don't think you'll hear about it anymore. He killed my Potono! Police! He killed him! Leave me alone! Give up! You'll never take Pasqualino Seven Beauties! Never will you be able to take him alive! - Stop bragging! - So I'm wrong! - Are you out of your mind? - Don't worry. - Where are you going? - Be quiet. Shit. Monster of Naples confesses! It's Pasqualino and no other! Latest edition! Big murder story! So, you have confessed. Yes, sir. Nobody in his right mind ever confessed such a thing. Complete madness! I will look ridiculous! What the hell do you think I can tell the judge, huh? It's impossible to defend this case. Advocate, this time I lost. I'm glad I confessed. I'm a man of honor. No, you're an asshole. How dare you! You'll pay for that! Calm down, or I leave. - Who the hell are you? - Your lawyer. Want to kill me as well? Watch that asshole stuff. I wanted to say incompetent. It's not so simple. I have a great reputation. You understand? If you screw yourself, I won't take the case. How can I defend you if you tell the truth? "The monster of Naples is captured and confesses." Whoever heard of such a thing? Confesses? It's... It's... It is unbelievable! Listen. "Confesses to cutting up the victim and shipping the body to three different cities." To do it, I understand. But to confess? The only thing left for us to do is plead insanity. - I don't get it. - I'll claim you're mad, out of your mind. Really? I have to deny an honorable act aimed at protecting the loss of dignity and pretend I'm a fool. Let's forget it, my friend. Can't you understand? Don't you see? You're confused! Look, they're going to condemn you to death, huh? It's the firing squad. I cannot play the fool. I'm sorry about Don Raphael, but I'll have to send you away. You'll give me a scoop. Understand? - I won't do it. - What should I do? I have high blood pressure. I've got to stay calm. Make up your mind. If you plead insanity, I'll defend you and we may save your neck. But if you prefer your stupid honor, we'll forget about it, and you're dead. Understand? It's your life or your honor. Think about it, Pasqualino Porfusso, and let me know. All right, then, you can see your visitors. Let the family in. Mama. Mama? Mama! - Pasqualino! - Mama! Pasquali, dear love! Mama! - My Pasqualino! - Mama! My son! My son! Mama. My son. Mama. At last I can see you. You're telling me. - How are you? - I'm not so well, Mama. How about you? Does Don Raphael give you anything? He's been helping us a little, but not with money. Just words. So it's been left for us to manage somehow. How do you manage? I will do all that I can... Concettina! Pasqualino! He's a friend. What do you want? Your lawyer's one of the best in Naples, recommended by Don Raphael. He costs a lot. You did commit the crime. She's not innocent. It's one matter not being innocent. Being a whore is another. Now, sweetheart, have a little patience. A rotten comedy, a lousy farce... called living. One, two, one, two... Your ass will drop and your belly will get fat without exercise. Come on. Run! Keep the body beautiful. You'll be as good as new. - Italians! - What now? Let's welcome the war for the virtues it brings out... in those of us who have the guts to fight. We're making history. Our people are a race of distant warriors! Duce! Duce! Duce! Duce! It's very funny. Our people are poets and heroes. - He's out of his mind. - And that is their fame. The challenge this breed poses is a threat to all on earth. Take him away, eh? And greet your sister. Political? Hatchet killer. Pasqualino Porfusso, the Monster of Naples. The act of an unbalanced mind. Twelve years. You're lucky. They gave me 28 years and four months. Twenty-eight? How did it come to that? I simply thought. It's the most atrocious crime a citizen could commit. He doesn't want that. You're anti-fascist. Socialist. To tell the truth, politics are boring. I've other interests. Papa was a bricklayer. He talked a little Socialism. But I don't think about it anymore... because I think Il Duce is pretty great. To be truthful, he's given us roads. He's given so much, an entire empire. All the other countries are jealous of our leader. Listening to the man speak to us... that voice and those eyes... and his court found me completely insane. But our people are respected. They used to spit at us Italians. On the face? Remember? Besides, there were many strikes, riots, demonstrations. We used to be in terrible condition. Thanks to him, there's been no disorder. He is a marvel. You're right. There has been law and order, and he's done it by outlawing unions and strikes. The result is that salaries in 1919 were up and today people are making less than half, while the cost of living has increased 30 percent. You didn't know that, huh? This Mussolini, of whom everyone envies us... Do you know who envies us? The masters envy Mr. Mussolini. The Italians are a bunch of fools, listening to that bag of air on his balcony. Your Duce. Wait, wait, no. Careful. They'll hear us. You mentioned the strikes and the riots. At least then we knew if there was a disease, we could hope to get well. Now we imagine we're strong and we hide the disease. That man will bring our country to war. That's the final catastrophe. You put it very well. What do you intend to do? I don't bother with politics. I go to the insane asylum and stay there for ten years. It's just a question of getting things organized, becoming friendly with some doctor or some nurse. In Naples, we were very inventive. I might get assigned to clean the women's quarters. Then I'll have it made. I'll be on Easy Street. What do you know? You're awake. - Let's see how well you've done. - A little bit. That's not much. Not enough. To pee is to live. The more you pee, the more you live. Pasqualino, how are you doing? Do you like your new job as intended? Keep up the good work. I'm starting procedures for a new psychiatric test. You'll see. They'll let you out. We have to put an end to this. All the judicial cases that end up here... What are you doing? What do you think? A gift from heaven can go to waste. I've had no woman now for seven months. I must ask you to forgive me. I must have a look. Leave it to me. I'm an expert. Let me please you. You want it. Stupid bitch! Go to hell! Shut up! Shut up, you idiot! Shut up! What do you want from me? That'll keep you quiet. I'll take care of you. Like to bite, eh? Rotted whore. Stinking, crazy bitch. Now we'll show you. - Get his pants off. - Right. Come on! Move! In seven weeks we'll be out of here. Then we'll leave, all of us, all of us. In seven weeks we'll be out of here. Then we'll leave, all of us. My cigarette! May the souls of your damn family burn in hell forever. I am starving! My cigarette! Though you've done these terrible things, you're normal. You can't be shut up in here with these hopeless cases. You must control yourself. You know what a revision of your mental status entails. Your behavior is what counts most. Eight more years here could drive me crazy, Doctor. - I really mean it. - I know, I know. Make an effort. Now is your chance. Pasqualino, Italy is at war now and they'll be needing all the men they can get. They can't be fussy about anyone who volunteers, even if it's someone coming out of prison. Of course, this doesn't apply to mental patients. But if we run psychiatric tests to demonstrate you've made a complete recovery... Help me, Doctor. I want to go on living. That isn't asking so much. Help me. Help me. I'll try my best for you. But I'm afraid this war will end in a terrible massacre. It couldn't be more terrible than in here. I'm ready to do anything to get out of here. I'm ready to do anything to live. Anything. I'm ready to do anything. How much sleep have I lost for you? For you Let me Crematorium Six. A night close to you With you Oh, Mari, oh, Mari How much sleep have I lost for you? Let me sleep Oh, Mari Get out. You too. Get up. What exactly is your game, shit macaroni? Jesus. You speak Italian. Then I can talk to you. At last I can talk to you. Who are... Who are you? An enchantress, or a magician? Because you put a spell on me. When I saw you the first time... I was... I... What are you saying, you disgusting macaroni? I love... I'm in love with you. I love you very much. Strip. What? Did I hear right? You asked... me to strip? All right. I'm willing... because I'd like to make you laugh, because I love you. You hate me. You all despise me. You want something to eat. You love me in order to get something to eat. I'm sorry, signora. You know how hungry I am. But what goes on inside my heart... you... you, signora, have no idea. You're right. Everybody hates you. I should too. I should hate you because I've never seen a woman like you. I have to admit I'm crazy... but the reason I'm crazy is because... because I'm not convinced you are as you seem. Who are you really? I need to know who you are. Tell me the truth. No. No, of course you are not a witch or an enchantress. I'm convinced you're just a poor victim, yes. You're a victim because you're forced into... forced to kill... You kill out of a sense of duty. Not a witch at all. You are a victim, like we are. There is... There is a real female under that uniform. I imagine the rosy flesh, delicate and beautiful and soft to touch. It drives me out of my head. Yes, I've gone out of my head. To caress sainted flesh is something I dream about. Yes. Yes, I can hardly stand on my feet. I think of you and I become weak. Yes, I'm in love. Love is a madness. It's a disease. When you're in love, you lose all perspective. I've gone crazy thinking of you. That's why I did what I did and that's why I'm here now. And that's why I'm asking you one big favor, one. If I'm to be killed, I ask to be killed by you, by the touch of your hand. I beg of you, touch me. And I'd be very glad if you killed me now. Touch me. You shit, Neapolitan. You can hardly stand. You cannot keep playing in this comedy of yours. You want to eat. Now you'll make love to me. Then I'll kill you with my bare hands. Understand? It's what you've asked, no? Yes. Thank you. You have to be patient. I love you, but I'm weak. You can't even open your eyes. You don't have the energy for an erection. Wake up! Eat, Naples. Now you eat. Afterward you fuck. If you don't fuck, you're finished. Fifi, my first love... help me get it up. I want to see your eyes. Garbage. You disgust me. Your thirst for life... disgusts me. Your love disgusts me. In Paris, there is a Greek who found strength to make love to a goose. He screwed for what it gave him, something to eat. It meant survival. And you, you subhuman Italian, you found the strength for an erection. And because you were strong you'll manage to live on and eventually you'll win. Miserable creature, lacking in ideals and ideas. And we... we who thought to create a master race... are doomed to failure. You're in barracks number 23, right? Starting right now, you're in charge of barrack 23. That's an order. As head of barrack 23, you are to designate any six that you like to be eliminated at once. Yes. If not, I eliminate all men in that barrack. You are to choose any six. And the others may get something to eat, even survive. You pick six or you'll all be cremated. Understand? Finished. The choice is yours. You pig. You rotten, dirty pig. Now you're a butcher like the rest of us, filthy, subhuman Italian. - No. - I've got to. The bitch said so. It's either six or all of us. Every last one of them is doomed to die. At least we'll save our ass. No. We'll be just like them. That's what they want. We must say no. So all the men will be dead tomorrow? All the men, tomorrow. Screw off. Say what you want, but remember who's boss. Here. Group three. Whoever they may be, I'm not interested. Into 14. I don't want to know who they are. Here, the first six. You need only five. What do you mean? I volunteer. You're crazy. Why? Because I'm fed up with this. Come on. Get in line. It's an order. It's an order. Go on. Quickly! Number 9423. Number 9632. 9541. Number 9376. Number 9535. Number 9464. Somebody smuggled food into barrack 23. In addition, stolen property of the Third Reich was found in barrack 23. As punishment for the breaking of regulations, these six men will face a firing squad. Enough with this fear! I've had enough, living in all this dark terror! Brothers, I'm going to throw myself in the shit! Screw you! Stop! A man in disorder! Get him out. Filthy rats! Bastards! Lousy, rotten sons of bitches! You filth! - Francesco! - Dirty pigs! Filthy murderers! Enough of your filthy killing! Lousy, rotten, no-good animals! Let me by! You're not even men! Leave him to me! - Give me... - Silly bastards! Put your hat on! Shut up, Francesco! You're crazy! Please fall down. Just pretend... Fall to the ground! Pretend! No! I don't want to live any longer! - Death can't be worse than this! - Fall down! Pretend! - Please shut up. - I'd rather die than live in this shit. I have the satisfaction of yelling... - Filthy pigs! - You're mad! - Inhuman sons of bitches! - Frances! Rotten animals! God... what do they want? What do they want? I won't shoot him. Shoot. Hurry up. You'll be freeing me. Come on. Shoot. Somebody else will shoot me if you don't. At least you're my friend. You'll be doing me a favor. Shoot. I won't be tortured anymore. Don't you understand? I can't play the hero much longer. Don't make me ashamed in front of the others. Shoot. Do me a favor. Come on. Go on, shoot, damn it. Mama! Guess! It's Pasqualino! Pasqualino is alive! He's alive! I can't believe it! He's alive! Pasquali! Pasquali! My boy is all right! And so you turned out to be a whore too? Yes. And did you earn enough to get along? Yes. Good. You're giving it up. We're getting married. There isn't much time to lose. I want children. Many children. Twenty, 30. It's a matter of self-defense. They must be strong. Look at the crowds out there. Soon they'll be murdering each other, families slaughtered for an apple. So we must see to it our family is large. That'll be our defense. Understand? I've always loved you very much. And I'm ready. We'll get married. The sooner the better. Please, Pasqualino, don't worry. Thank the Madonna for returning you to us. One mustn't look back on what's passed. It's so senseless. What's done is done. Look. Look at yourself, my son. You're beautiful. The war is ended. It's useless to think about these miseries. Pasqualino, you're alive. Alive! Yes, I'm alive.
