I'll try manual control. Signal surgers at full capacity. Full capacity, damn it. Something went wrong. Our signal shocker indicated immediate effectiveness. What was wrong? I don't understand. Power sector: zero. Control sector: zero. Without you there would be a big hole on Tem 4 now. Nothing in sight. No settlement. No animals. No water. Who knows what happened here. They are not living in the stone age. There are radio waves. Radar +1 Moving object. They have a vehicle. Attention. One land rover coming from the north east. A strange looking thing. I'll get ready for the welcoming ceremony. Be careful. You say, be careful. But what you mean is, be mistrustful. We have been called here to help. I will remain on board. Article 23: Take security measures when on unknown planets. Who is the leader? This is our commander. My name is Akala. Welcome, Commander. I am Chta. Please come with me. Everything has been prepared for your reception. Right now, as we are? Why not? Are you leaving Suko here? - Is there no water here? - In the north there is a big sea. In the south, too. Tem 3 calling Tem 4. Central control to Tem 4. Come in. Tem 3. Direct connection with the boss. Everything went as planned... Forced emergency landing successful... See... that you quickly... ... have no trouble with Cynro. Keep an eye on Ronk. He enjoys playing along. It looks like they were hanged. We bring greetings from the inhabitants of Planet Cynro. Blue is sweet. Red is a little spicy. I am Akala. A few years ago, - the span of time is due to the distance between our solar systems- we received a call for help from your planet. We couldn't get radio contact to find out anything concrete. So, here we are. What kind of help do you need? We don't need any help. But we received a call for help from you. We built a radio installation and conducted a few experiments. It proved to be unsuitable so we discontinued the tests. We never thought our signals would be received anywhere. If that's the case we can turn around and go home. Yes, you can. We have come a very long way for such a short answer. That's good. I'll remember that one. Our spaceship must first be prepared for launch. That will take at least three or four days. Damn! Why is Ronk letting them go? Boss, what's the matter? Why can't I keep them here? New order from Tem 3. No violence. Flatter them out of the way. I'm not with you, boss. I might as well invite them to a wild midnight party. Of course, why not? Unwelcome. Stop your nonsense, Thob. It isn't my nonsense. It is Temian nonsense. Our arrival surprised them. Maybe they are simply afraid of us. If I test a new installation, my first signal isn't a call for help. What are you doing, Suko? Aren't you interested in how friendly the Temians were? We are so unwanted here that the dear inhabitants of this planet wanted to crash our beloved spaceship. - You're exaggerating. - That's a bold claim. Have I ever made a claim I couldn't prove? All radio transmissions they sent have been recorded. These are radio signals, not atmospheric discharge. Thob, I'll upload them to the Lambda channel. You switch to synchronize with our landing program. Altitude... out of control. Well, Commander? When will the unwelcome ones depart? The technical preparations for departure will drag on until we know what is really going on around here. My suspicions were not incorrect. I can play back what I recorded during your absence. I was not talking about suspicions but rather figuring out what is behind the Temians' behaviour. Their attempt to force a crash landing can certainly be interpreted as panic. I think Miu is right. Radar +1 Moving object. We have guests. A little misunderstanding at the first encounter. I brought invitations for a great reception. Thank you very much. I am staying on board. I'll bring you Temian champagne. We accept. And I'll try to steal you a menu as a souvenir. Odd people. First they want to crash our ship and now this. You mentioned a large radio installation. What was the purpose for your experiments? Our scientists had that idea. I think it's foolish to broadcast all over the universe. ''Hello, here we are! Where are you?'' I'm sure you are familiar with the same gimmicks. Cynro must also have specialists gazing into far-away galaxies. Otherwise you wouldn't be here, would you? A lovely evening. I'm glad you like it here. Have you worked here in the centre long? - Would you like something to drink? - No thanks, I don't drink. Did your ancestors make such pretty things? Certainly an old tradition on Tem 4. The modern clothes look very different. Please excuse me. I have many guests to attend to. Thob, what about that call for help? Hopeless. You can see: all numbskulls. But beautiful. Gorgeous. This park belongs to the boss. Normally we aren't allowed here. But this is a special evening. The park belongs to the leader? Who is your leader? No, more extraordinary. Excuse me, please. At first I had misgivings about accepting the invitation. If you want to uncover a secret you have to approach it slowly. But that won't help us at all. The leader. Yes, sir? This is Ronk. You are a brilliant host. But I have some information. They sent a laser to Cynro. We have partially decoded it. They suspect something was amiss about their emergency landing. Cynro has been warned. If there is no movement here they'll send an entire fleet. Make sure they are sent off with a friendly farewell. They'll forget that call for help and disappear on their own. I guarantee it, sir. Now we are finally all together. Look at my suit. Burn holes from the fiery gaze of Temian women. Fantastic. Suko, you have to taste this. Blue is spicy. No, bittersweet. No, spicy and sour. I got this from my porcelain doll. Just listen for a second, Thob. - What did you find out? - It was fun and you're so boring. Go to sleep. Quite a hangover. Are you envious, Suko? Yes, it was a very festive evening. The Temians are cheerful people. Cheerful and a little exuberant. Sorry, if I got on your nerves with my suspicions. But this crash attempt shocked me. I'll make you a nice mocha. What for? I feel great. Tomorrow morning we're preparing for our return. You and Thob check the hangar. Have you tried the drinks and the praline balls? That was a festive evening. Really cheerful people. Hey, I asked you something. No ''thank you''? Nothing? I didn't taste them. I am analysing them. - Why? - They could have been poison, biotopes, bacteria, enzymes, anything. Poison! Are you nuts? The friendly Temians? Fun, cheerful Temians. Festive evening. You went to the party to find out about the call for help, not dance! If you want to beat each other up shut off the room speaker. Unless you like an audience. Akala wants you in the pilotron. - What is it with you two? - I don't know either. I think he is angry because we had too much fun at the party. What about that call for help? Tell me. I don't know what you mean. You must have discovered something. How can I make sense of your sudden command to go back? Why not? What are you talking about? Our mission has been fulfilled. Why waste our precious time? Waste our time? By the way... We have another invitation. A farewell party before we launch. This time you're coming too, right? It will certainly be fun. The Temians are a happy people. Cheerful and a little exuberant. Akala, listen carefully. I overheard something during your first visit to their centre. Tem 3 calling Tem 4. Central control to Tem 4. Come in. Tem 3. Direct connection with the boss. Everything went as planned... Forced emergency landing successful... What do you have to say? I surmise it is an offshoot of Tem 3, a colony. I have two things to say: First, if you think it is of such vital importance, why didn't I find out about it immediately? Second, You should have become an historian. You could cause a sensation with theories like that. As I see it, our flight orders don't say anything about sending this Ronk or anyone else to hell. You should be mindful of discipline. I believe you were assigned to check the probe hangar. Miu, can you hear me? Pay attention and think carefully before answering. Why was Akala so hasty to order that we fly back? Do you agree with it? Does everyone agree? We are not a research team. The mission has been fulfilled. We're flying home. What did you eat and drink at that party? Do you think her command was influenced by alcohol? You know me, I never drink alcohol. I didn't eat or drink anything. I had no appetite. The Temians didn't force anything on me, either. Would you describe them as cheerful? Cheerful is a stupid word but sure, the Temians are... Cheerful, enthusiastic people. Cheerful and a little exuberant.. You were supposed to find out the reason for the call for help. Is our darling Suko a little jealous? What's wrong? What is troubling you? Suko, what is wrong with you? Why don't you go to bed? Everyone has to be fresh for duty tomorrow. What do you think about flying back? What I think of it? I am happy about it, of course. Aren't you? I have a small problem in the engine sector. I'll report back in five minutes. I am going to bed, Illyk. Enjoy your watch. Oh, I inadvertently disabled the shield. Please turn it back on. Sir, sorry to wake you. Bad news. The Cynro people have sent a reconnaissance probe. How should I react? Force a landing or contact Tem 3? In which direction? - Exactly where it shouldn't be. - Bring it down. Heads will roll if something goes wrong this time. Quiet. No impact. Therefore no crash. Send land rovers to it. Hermetically seal the landing site immediately. - The guards shouldn't see you. - We are happy you have come. Who are you? How did you know we landed? Quick, get him out of here. We are the Turi. This is our planet. Quick, go. Defective. Who last saw Suko? I relieved his watch. Later he wished me a good night. Please try to remember exactly the last thing he said. He apologized for disabling the shield and asked me to turn it on. That way he could get away on the probe, undetected. But why? And where to? He wasn't happy about our plans to return. Now he is forcing us to stay until we can find him. But... How will the Temians react to his excursion. - Such a crazy idea. - Radar +1 Moving object. We will find out momentarily. There is that bus. Maybe they are bringing Suko. I have come to pick you up. For a sightseeing programme, I was told. Do you think they noticed Suko's little expedition? Rall, you stay here. Maybe Suko will call. We will return in 2 to 3 hours. Why were you flying? To prepare for our return flight. - Did you take aerial photos? - The camera is defective. Dear friend, I don't have time like my men do. I cannot chat with you for hours. On that chair everyone chats with me. Can you understand what I am saying? I will ask you a few very simple questions. Each time you have 5 seconds to answer. Understand? - Why were you flying? - To prepare for our return flight. Why so fast? You have 5 seconds to answer. One more time. What was the purpose of your flight? To prepare for our return flight. Did you take aerial photos? The camera is defective. Did you take aerial photos? You have 5 seconds to answer. Wait, we want to go too. For you we have prepared a snack. If you please. It won't be easy for Akala. Please have a seat. Don't be afraid. It is very poisonous... but extremely obedient. Sometimes I play with this for hours on end. Don't you want to try it? A good playmate is priceless. I'm afraid you didn't like our party last night... Or was it the night before? Unfortunately I had a terrible headache. It is hard to know guests' wishes who have come from so far away. I hope you will join me for breakfast. A tough dog. One of the women didn't come. There were four at the party. Wait, I see an opportunity to take their ship in a surprise attack. Can you fly this Cynro probe? I think I can. Give him the music treatment. If he won't tell us anything he should forget what he has seen. Let's get to the point. We didn't ask anyone for help. The reason for your long trip is illusory. You were going to prepare for your departure. It amazes me that one of your people engaged in a reconnaissance flight over our planet. Where is our friend? I am accustomed to having my questions answered first. You haven't asked any questions. You must have realized that we come here in peace. And you know we must prepare for departure as planned... We have to try... Only with mutual trust... I had a little accident but these two helped me. I had to make an emergency landing, something defective... We cannot continue our conversation. I have to take care of my crew. Where is Ronk? - We don't know. - Answer, you toad! He flew to their spaceship. Radar +1 Flying object. You gave us quite a fright with your idea of an outing. You're lucky Akala isn't here. She is pretty angry. Suko, are you mute? Stay in the probe and close the hatch, immediately. Radar +1 Moving object. Taking a nap? Why did you let us bang into the shield? Look into the hangar monitor. I have two prisoners. Look at that. It's Mr. Ronk. Those scoundrels. Come out of there but don't try anything stupid. We know your methods of questioning people. Permit me to pose a question using our methods. Is it true? You are returning our probe that had to make an emergency landing? I would be pleased... if you understood our mission in that way. There is a vehicle outside that you will drive home. Tell your boss to lay off his tricks. We depart in 36 hours. Come. He is trying to remember something. But he can't. He has a mental block. I cannot find any other explanation for his behaviour. Mental block? Listen, Miu. When I was with the boss I had this feeling that I couldn't think what I wanted to. Wait a minute. Everything in its turn. In high doses, ultrasound can create a mental block. For fear of pain. But you haven't been treated with ultrasound. I injected Suko with a heavy dose of korin. Any pain block should have subsided. Do you find an acoustic influence plausible? Then let's try something visual. I found some photos in the probe. Maybe they will help him remember. There is only one more. There. Look. A shaft to the mine below. Do you see the men? The Turi. It is their planet. I will make sure he sleeps 24 hours. Miu, is it possible that not only Suko but all of us have been mentally blocked? Then there is something we cannot think or say. Something we haven't spoken of since we have been blocked. Our computer should be able to compare our speech. HELP. CALL FOR HELP. Illyk, can something be done? Yes, but it only takes effect after 24 hours of sleep. If they show up, they will have to come through the entry hatch. Then we've got them. No, absolutely wrong. We will let them come in. That way we will know which Turi contacted them. Maybe there are a few ringleaders. They are overhead with one manned and three unmanned probes. -Go. These louts are careful. They got wind of something. That might perk up the Turi. Bring him to me. I don't care how. Hurry! Get to our rovers, fast. Hurry. He is bleeding badly. He must see our doctor right away. Thob, what's wrong? We need our second probe. There are four of us now. - What do we do now? - Wait and see. Give us the Turi and we'll let you go. Command from Ronk: Attack. They can't get us. They can't bring us back. - Have you regained power? - Not yet. If the vehicles approach take off at full throttle. They can't adapt their weapons that quickly. What about you? That's an order. There is our second probe. A series of nice successes. First, the fortuitous crash. Second, the surprise attack and the greeting in the mine that was planned. Oh yeah, there is one thing you forgot to report. How you got that little scratch. The Cynro people played a joke. They build invisible protective shields around their probes. And you tested the shield with your head? Or were you trying to bring back the two Turi... who escaped you? The shield wasn't anticipated and the planned attack... was a complete failure. Now the two Turi are in the spaceship. And the cosmonauts are more savvy than we would like. What that means for us... and how Tem 3 will react to it... No, boss. I only wanted to... For you, boss, I... No sir, let me explain. You have 5 seconds to answer. I have the solution. A fantastic idea. Tem 3 will be satisfied. We won't use violence, just the forces of nature. We can pump up the underground river beneath their landing site. They will have to fly away before the water floods in. So, the Temians have been on your planet for three generations. And they only wanted that one mineral. You had to mine it and they flew it back to Tem 3. Correct? Did you try to prevent it? We tried to defend ourselves. But their weapons outmatched us. We could not force them to leave our planet by ourselves. Just a moment. The call for help came from you? Two young ones helped the Temians build a radio installation. They tried to send a call for help but after a short time something blocked the transmitter. They were both shot. We had to watch it. They were Xik's sons. Please, give us weapons. Together, we can drive them from our planet. Xik is dead. Whenever we were in despair he gave us courage. His death will shake everyone up. This is the right moment. Give us weapons. Let's say we gave you weapons. How long before Tem 3 would send over spaceships? And then what? Cynro would have to send ships. A galactic war would be waged on your planet. It's absurd. Then we have no hope. It will take so long that many of us won't live to see it. That is distressing, for us too. But we cannot build a shield around your planet so that you can develop undisturbed. You are very wise, Suko. I understand every word. Yet... I don't understand it. Xik... He would have understood you. He thought and spoke just like you. Radar +1 Moving object. Akala, tell me what we should do. I cannot answer your question. But one thing I know for sure... Help doesn't simply mean that we give you weapons. Help means so much more. - Are the Temians attacking? - Do we have visitors? I don't understand why our radar announced that. - Nothing in sight. No movement. - Maybe it's only the ground waves. Where the terrain rises the radar detects the ground waves within its scope. Why all of a sudden? Perhaps a minuscule adjustment. You seem almost disappointed. Would you prefer it if the Temians attacked us? Then Akala's difficult decision would be made. Wonderful, it's working. Get to work! Push them to work hard and fast. Machines would be much faster. Why don't we use them? You idiot! The spaceship would detect the machine noise. If we could remain undetected for a day, a night and a day... A clever man. Why doesn't he come and report the outcome? Akala, please. Everyone knows Suko only came because of you, because he... Because he what? He isn't a know-it-all. It's just as hard for him as it is for you. Knowledge of history is one thing. Tactical procedures are another. If we really want to help the Turi... Calm down. What's the matter? Have we let you down? You are afraid of making a decision. I'll manage somehow. I am unhappy with that response. If we want to help the Turi, then... What then? Then we will have to stay here. Stay here? You mean stay here forever? You cannot be serious, Akala. Do you really mean that? Stay here? Forever? Did I hear that correctly? That's not the way our mission should be understood. Besides... A plan like that doesn't have a chance. It's absurd. Whether we stay here forever, or another crew from Cynro relieves us: It amounts to a confrontation between Tem and Cynro. Can't you see that? Your logic is: only our departure can prevent war. Our immediate departure. When we wanted to leave before, - a result of our mental block- you on your outing forced us to stay here. I didn't know about the Turi then. A return flight seemed necessary. Leaving is impossible now, given the Turi's situation. What if you send a laser to Cynro to ask what they think? You are the commander, after all. The decision has to be made here not on Cynro. Are there any orders, Commander? Did you really go on this flight only because of me? Are you aware that you have not convinced the others? The others? Why do you exclude yourself? Listen, Akala. If you are standing by your decision then I have the right to assume my duty as ship's doctor. I suggest someone else take over the command, whose mission is to bring the crew home. After a thorough radio communication with Cynro. If that's your opinion then act accordingly. I'm not mad. I don't care what a different commander would do in my position. I must do what I think is necessary. I checked the radar adjustments. It is working fine. Please get a connection to central command for me. Ask for the boss. Right away. The crew doesn't stand behind me. Maybe I will find some way so that we don't have to stay. - Do you like that idea? - Yes, I do. - Where do you want to meet him? - I hope you'll fly me there. We will never finish at this rate. Push them! The excavation must be ready for the pump's installation. What is it? Sir, their probe is on its way. What should we do? Bring the commander to my park. How is Ronk progressing? The pump equipment has arrived. Everything is going according to Ronk's plan. Victory. If you insist on entering the lion's den, then I want to hear the beasts when they pounce on you. Test it. If I give the signal return immediately. I promise. I'm glad we can continue our talk that was interrupted before. I hope music doesn't bother you. Distractions help me concentrate. I have thought a great deal about you. What kind of people are you? What compels you? What laws determine your actions? Our first law says: No human may oppress another. A nice thought. But the Turi have no culture. You see, by the time you are on your way home, the Turi will believe they were dreaming. Gods descended from heaven, they were friendly, and then they disappeared. They will likely pray to these gods. Their modest lives may become a little brighter. Nothing more. But that is a great deal. I hope you have some time for me, it is so pleasant to chat. What a foolish thought: Brotherhood. Only one law applies to me: Power. Then you will have to hurry. Why? I don't understand. Your great era is coming to an end. Don't you see? This planet's secret has been revealed. It's the first step. The first step? Where to? Did I frighten you? That was not my intention. What has happened? I have a proposal to make: Stay on Tem 4. Would you enjoy having me here? You are intelligent. If you play by the rules, certainly. Yes, I understand you. Rule number one: What is on top, stays on top. Rule number two: Those who are below, stay below. Exactly how it is and how it will remain. Or do you want to give the Turi weapons? Obviously you can only think in terms of primitive violence. Try to follow my line of thinking: Your coexistence on the Turi's planet... The Turi's planet? It belongs to us. We conquered them. No power in the galaxy can drive us away. Chta escaped and came to us. She said the Temians plan to flood our launching pad. I understand. Boss, there is a report from ZB 3. The Turi girl, Chta, escaped. What should we do? Fly away! Forget that Tem 4 exists. The probe is coming with the Cynro people. Drive the Turi to the pump as closely as possible. Depth no longer perceivable. Only 30cm to reach flood level. Akala, we must destroy the pump. If you want to pay for it with the lives of 500 Turi. The Temians pushed them close to the pump station. - Emergency launch. - Understood. Emergency launch. Akala, Suko, pick us up from here right away. Akala, this is Kte. The pumping station must be destroyed. We will help you. Otherwise you won't manage it. - We want to speak with our people. - We're coming. Sir? The Cynro's probe brought two Turi to the building site. Get Ronk. And I want to listen in on the radio connection with the ship. Go back, you damned bastards or I'll shoot. We can't get to the pumping station, but we... Hold up the water. Hurry up and launch. Ronk, the boss wants to speak with you. What is it? Don't lose your head. Leave those little people alone. First the spaceship must launch and disappear. Then you can feed the Turi to your goldfish. But for now, concentrate fully on the take-off. Understand? The Turi have stopped working. Ronk, come here. Quick. Ronk threw down the walkie-talkie. Hello, come in. This is Prott. Come in. Order from the boss: Blow up the canal at once. Repeat. Blow up the canal at once. - But what about Ronk? - Leave that to the boss. How far are you? Hurry, we can't wait any longer. Engine station sector Preliminary stage: 2 Chta, come in. Suko, what's the matter? They are blowing up the reservoir. You have 30 seconds to lift-off. Hurry. What happened? Suko. Sir, do you read me? The water is flowing. Everything according to my plan. And I taught that chap a lesson. That imbecile. That damned Akala. Those damned Turi. We will never be able to subdue them again.
