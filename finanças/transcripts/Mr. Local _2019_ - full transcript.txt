Said I can never speak English. Ok, Ok. I will talk slowly. So now, will you please tell me, how did you shoot this goal? With this foot. That's not funny. That was hard brother. The reason why I'm asking is, this goalkeeper is a real good goalkeeper. No one hits a goal while he is standing. So that's why tell me. How did you hit this goal? I imagined my girlfriend as goalkeeper. I got fired up. Smashed right through it. Goal! You imagined your girlfriend? Yep. Is your girlfriend your enemy? For all the boys, girlfriend is their first enemy. I agree. You want to know the full story? Sure. But I will tell only in English. Ok. Go ahead. I'm not responsible if you don't get it. Come. In India, there is one amazing state called TamilNadu. In TamilNadu, there is a beautiful city called Chennai. In Chennai, there is GN Chetty Road.

Someone must have hacked my mouth. Pissed at me? Yep. Let it slide, darling. For the launch of the new model, a foreign model is here, in the guise of a Manager. Super! You have a chance to settle in foreign now. Saamy Saranam. Stop joking, darling. She has banned Ayudha Poojai in our Office. She has banned Ayudha Poojai? - Yep. - What is this darling? Peta came in and banned Jallikattu. Now Rita comes in and bans Ayudha Poojai? What is wrong with this place? To keep away all the wrong spirits, we do Poojai. She says it'll spoil the car's looks.

Sir, Take me to her. No its not my work. Sir! Take me to her and I'll request for Ayudha Poojai. He doesn't even know to read the word English. What would have been his conversation? What a model! Two tops on her. - Saamy Saranam. - Saamy Saranam. Can we speak to her, Sir? Start the conversation, Sir. I don't permit all this kinda stuff in... Excuse me Ms Rita, I'll just call you back.

And become a priest?" Why? Shouldn't I sing taking her to a honeymoon? Why so much hate brother? I'm frustratedly single. Stop whining, pick up the phone. Who's that at this hour? Well, it's our guy. Hi Surendar! My name is Sundar. Doesn't matter. Is it ready? Perfectly ready. Is it a killer? - Yes! We are on our way to pick it up. - Come soon. I'm driving. Bye. Baby! Yes, baby.

Alright, let's go check the TV. A moment. That won't work out. Neither of you are at fault. We are guilty. Some signal problem. What is this nonsense? Let's not waste time here. Come, let's go. Hey,trying to escape are we? You were over-speeding. You made the crash. Better apologize now. Or you ain't going anywhere. Why should I ask sorry? Mr Mayilvaganam, whatever it is I'll face it legally. Nonsense. Look at her arrogance, mom. She just walked out. I'll... She's gonna be sorry for this. Hey! Did you note down the number? No?

Come. We'll sort her out. Yep. Oye! You ran away from asking sorry. That's why God has sent you here. Apologize now. Otherwise you'll face the consequences. I should apologize? Me? Do you know who I am? That's not who I am, "Who am I?" Jackie Chan Movie. We saw it in Woodlands remember? Lakshman Uncle! Yes madam. These guys are meddling with me, without knowing me.

Villian of the show. Name is Madhavi. Divorcee. She ain't married yet. What can I do? Watch your words. - Uncle! What's happening? - Sorry Madam. She is the producer of this show. CEO of KV Entertainment. MD. Keerthana Vasudevan. Got it? Cat got your tongue? Keerthana Vasudevans shouldn't apologize? You have two horns? Who let these local guys in shooting spot? Are you filming Avatar for the International crowd? Shut up, you halfwit. - Ok you dumbwit. Stop spraying please. Keerthu Mam, in our Kungumam show, there's an up and coming artist Sowmiya, they have come to meet her from some ditch. Sowmiya! Madam... Told you we were haunted... Here's the devil. Sorry madam. They are my guests. - Oh... They have to be out in 2 minutes. It's your responsibility. Otherwise I'll call the cops. I'll give you the same 2 minutes. Apologize to my mom. Otherwise I'll call the FBI. Why are you calling the banks? Mom, it's Police from America. Mano, please. I'll apologize on Madam's behalf... Please go away. Let it go. I'm sparing her for your kind heart. But I have few things to say. Look, Do you know who she is? "The Lady Superstar" of TV. Look how humble she is. After all, you are a producer Look at the arrogance on you. Mano... Stop creating a ruckus. Please stop talking. - Madam Listen, You don't know your popularity. We are Sowmiya's fans. We'll pay people to troll you on Social Media. Do they pay for this? Yes they do mom. Please Sir. - Sowmiya Madam, when you are at leisure, teach her some manners. Learn from her. Let's go Mom. Yes let's go. Are you a star? I'll write you off the show. Mind it. Sorry madam. - Sir! Sir... Mam... Also... Don't glare often. It's quite disturbing. Understood? Think on it.

You are still here, shame. The first reason behind this record, is my son. Thanks dear. Mom people are watching, behave. Speak a couple of words to them. I'll make dinner for you - Couple of words? Just a couple. Show's over people. Go watch Breaking News, go. That's their routine. Will they not be bored? Mom, to make it interesting they play music to news. That's right. Are you guys not moving? No refreshments here, disperse. Go feed your kids. You wanna dodge cooking and order online. I'll take my bike later. Keep moving. Mano Mano... - Yes? I would love to take a pic with Pepsi Uma on my birthday. Can you do it for me? Pepsi Uma? Just a picture, please. Were you in a coma for 20 years? You are not in the mood today. - Mood?

Sowmiya is here to meet you. Huh? Sowmiya! Where? There in her car. Hi Sowmiya! Your fans are thronging the shooting sets, trying to take pictures, you have grown real quick!

Don't forget them on your way out. Ok? All the best. For your actions, I've lost my career. We'll meet Keerthana tomorrow, clarify your innocence, and get you back on the show. That would be a great help Madam. Don't worry. Be strong. Thank you Madam. We were 10 minutes late. That's a mistake. I admit. You can talk to them, warn them or even deny a day's pay But how can she fire her? Such arrogance! I don't care what you would do, But I can't bear to watch anybody except Sowmiya on that show. I'm talking to you, son. What are you fiddling there? I think he's playing PubG. I'm serious here and you are looking at... Mom, mom... look. Keerthana's office address, phone number, email id, Facebook id I'm taking half a day's leave, We'll put Valli back under the spotlight Baby. Remember to act like a Northerner.

She's building a house. Excus... How rude. There's an elder in. He is Lakshman Uncle. Looks like a Globe perched on a sofa. Posturing... - Vanakkam Sir. - Vanakkam Sir. Hey, who let you in? The door was open Sir. So you'll just walk in? - Sir, forgive me Sir. Oh God! Stop pleading with me. I've forgiven, get up. - No Sir Ask him to get up. - He's already up.

Sorry for disturbing you. Manohar, here. This guy? Why did you bring him? Didn't say I can't meet him? Regretting the incident on shooting spot earlier, he begged apology from me. So? So, he wanted to apologise to you too. Brought him along. 2 minutes Madam. Please, you listen to me. Ok Ok, only 2 minutes. Make it fast. Be smart with your apology. Your brother will be outside. Good luck. Madam, if you are miffed with me, punish me. Why is that actor taking the heat? Poor thing. Get her back on your show. It's in everybody's interests. Came in to say this. Good bye. My parents have named me Manohar. You can call me the same. Snap at your slaves. Never... at me. Is the owner of KV Entertainment, your grandfather? Your father? Or is it you? Issuing commands here. Listen... This is my company. My show. My staff. I will have my way. Who are you to question me? Keerthana Vasudevan, you are educated but you barely understand. The show is watched for that actor. Not for you or your KV Entertainment. Better get her back on the show. Or, you have doomed the show. Hey, came in with the pretence of apologising, now you advise me? Your time is over. Out. Kungumam show must have Sowmiya as Valli. Dare you replace her with a Ramya or Mozorella. You are finished. Do your worst idiot, get out. Shame, she has no respect. Where are your parents? Let's have a PTA. Dare you speak about my parents. So let's talk about your grandparents. Now what, girl? I didn't intend on touching you. I'll go now. Do what I said and this episode ends today, or it drags on for years like your TV Soaps. Did you get it? What's your perfume? Smells like you are walking along with me. What happened to Valli? What happened to Kungumam? What happened to Keerthana? What happened to you? You sound like my mother watching a cliffhanger. - Sorry? - Keerthana got angry with Valli. Valli got angry with me. I got angry with Keerthana. It's too confusing. I can't understand. I'll tell you in detail. That day it was Asha's birthday. Who is Asha now? Our office Aishwarya Rai What the hell? Not for me, for my manager Kuthala Chidambaram. Fat boy. He used to say that she is the Aishwarya Rai of our office. Oh! That day what happened, know? Asha's birthday today. How do I impress her? Let's try a video call. (Imitating Nic Cage - We are here to ruin ourselves To break our hearts and love the wrong people) The one who should be in a cage. She can't stand my happiness. Blockhead... Hello - Blockhead? Whom do you mean? Not you, I meant Mano, Raja. Stupid fellows. What's up? Haven't you started? No, not yet dear. Doctor's appointment at 4.30, asked you to be with me. Kept nodding in the morning, have you forgotten? No dear. So busy in the office. Can't leave for 2 hours. Please understanding. Why don't you take your mother? - My mother? It's been two years since she passed. I'll see you in the evening. It's been two years since she died? I'm dead. Wish she went along with her mother. She never lets me be happy. (In unison) Excuse me, Sir. Hey... May I come in, Sir? Already you came here. Stupid questions, idiots. Sir seems angry. Did your wife call, Sir? Or, did Asha not call you Sir? None of your business. Ok? Yes, it is between you and Asha. Exactly, exactly exactly. That’s 50 Thousand. Put it in FD under Asha’s name. - Fixed Deposit, Sir? That’s good. Account? - I’ll send the account details on Whatsapp. This transaction…? - Should be kept secret because... You are the manager, can't do few things by your hands. Also, you have an image to maintain. Very good job, right now you go out. Ok Sir. You stand. Sir? You go. - Sorry, Sir. Hey! You stand. You go. Country fool. God save us from his English. Works in a car company, idiots. Is this for another girl? - Mind your words, Mr Mano. Is this for another staff, Sir? - That's good. Gift voucher for Asha from me. That culprit shouldn't know this. This is part of job description now. What? Nothing Sir. Asha is here, Sir. - How? Smell. Smell? Perfume smell, Sir. How about you? - Yea, I’ll apply now. Good luck for your intent, Sir. Hi Ashu. Talk to me. Many more happy returns of the day, my dear. - Thank you Sir. Won’t you gift me today, Sir? I have a surprise, in private. Small or a big one? Not a small one. Tell me more Sir. - Excuse me Sir, look here please. Lighting is better there, go take a selfie. Sorry Sir. No pictures in the office, no posts on Facebook. I don’t like that. Strictly prohibited, got it? Yes Sir. Why? Can we not take a picture with you? Won't you do this for me? Shame. No Aishu. I’ll snap with my own cellphone. And I'll post it at the right time. Ok? Ok? Ok? Its getting slippery, people. - Cake Sir, cake. - Cake was getting slippery. Be clear. He said that, Sir. You look like a father-daughter duo. - I’ll slap you. Management skills: infidelity Come on, darling. Hold my hand. Sir, a picture…? Never lets go. Hold this. Sir? You don’t want this? - Take a photo. Sure. Hey, there’s no light here. You, lazy lout... You can’t hold a meeting. At least, hold a torch. What is this? Go on. Be useful. Will the light even make a difference? - Hold it up. Say cheese. Cheeeeeese. Sir, cut the cake. Sir, give Asha some cake. Asha now give him some cake Sir now kiss Asha. Sorry Sir, I got carried away. Why did you stop there? Sir, light? - Turn it off. Come, leave them alone. Happy Birthday sweetheart! Sir! - Yes? Mano has a question for you. What now? Shall I put it on FB? Sorry? Shall I put it on FB? Why are you yelling? Go ahead. Birthday celebration with Asha doll. - Tag Asha. Posted. Mano, guard said police is waiting for you. Police? There’s an enquiry, get in the car. Enquiry? Sir are we dissenters, Anti-Social or Urban Naxal elements? Why is there an enquiry? He wants to know the proper reason, Sir. You have touched the untouchable. Dude, where did you touch? What’s that? Get in the car by yourself. You have 2 minutes. I just need a minute, Sir. Darling, let’s take a short trip. This is not a loo break. I can’t come along. - Are you a friend? Had it been Auto Sekar here, he would have taken a bullet for me. - Why are you comparing me with him? - How about comparing him with you? Let’s go. Say your flashback in four shots. Have mercy on him Vignesh and Shiva! You’ve got into a big trouble, why didn’t you tell me? You were in Mount Sabarimalai. How can I inform you? Duck... This penance chain is distorting my cuss words. Why are you sharing now? If I’m thrown into prison, I would need some company. We’ll have Comrades Seeman and Mansoor Ali Khan there. But they are Seniors. Can’t have the comfort level, I have with you. So tagging you along. Saying it like we are heading to Bangkok. I haven’t even seen her. Why should I go to jail? Are you even a friend? You’ll start with sekar now. “He’ll take one on his cheek He’ll take one on his d…” Sssshhh... Oh Muruga! Arogara, Arogara! Muruga, Prasanna Kumar. Yes Muruga, Where are you taking my darling? This is Keerthana Vasudevan. The event begins at 6 PM sharp. That accused… What’s his name? Manohar. Should be there by 6.15. On my signal, he runs towards the stage. There, our PA will try to stop him. Becomes a little chaotic. “Madam, just need 2 minutes from you”, he pleads. I’ll turn to my PA “Leave him, let’s hear what he has to say”. PA let’s go of him. He then comes on stage. Touches my feet, wishing me. Confesses to all the things that happened in the office, in detail. And apologizes. Apology? Auditorium is on the left. If you give her the apology, you can live. Collector’s office on the right. There you’ll be asked to run. And shot. Branded as an outlaw. Sir let’s go home, take a U Turn. No U turns in this case. Do you wanna live or die? Left or right? You have 20 seconds time. Your time starts now. Muruga, why are you even thinking? Choose left, quick. At least show a left sign. Sir will understand. Sir, let’s go left. Go right. - Stop, stop. Sir he meant left, Sir. Take a left please. - Go left. (KV Entertainment has completed 5 years today.) (We're having a grand celebration!) Woah! (A few words to describe Keerthana Mam would be, loyalty, dignity, morality, humane...) What? Why are you tickling Sir? That’ the signal. Time for your apology. Apology… (Madam you are a true inspiration for all of us) (Please share a few words with us) Madam! Stop him… stop. Hey Kungumam show, catch him! - Hey stop… stop. Madam... I won't let you. - Madam, I have few things to say. Am I talking to you? Let her decide. 2 minutes madam. I'll be quick. Uncle, he wants to say something. Let’s hear him out. Wow! "Thoppul Kodi", "Manjal Kayiru", "Ariyatha Vayasu"... Watch it! That's an adult film. I meant "Pinju Manasu" Take their numbers. - I won’t. Why? #MeToo For my mother, she would love to call them. Please give your numbers. You can trust him. He’s in penance. Hello, I’m your fan since I was a kid. Get up. Number…? - Get up! Is he gonna begin a party? - Another one? Would you like to join him? - Why not? Madam... please ask them to give me a mic. When I apologize, you'll hear it, they will hear it. But I want the whole of TamilNadu to hear it. What’s gonna happen now? Do you have show material for this month? - Nope. You’ll have it now. - Let’s see. Carnival at your place? I’ll come next week. Don't smile now. What's up, people! Ok ok. Just testing the mic, Madam. Dignifying the stage, we have a relic, a mannequin, and a nun straight out of the Conjuring Universe. Also the dumb scientist from all the Bruce Willis movies. Mainstreaming sleazy content is Mangalyam Ravi. Thanks! - Look at his pride! Members of the TV fraternity, Brothers, Sisters, Friends, And my dear fans... Cut the crap. Not to forget, Crappy Uncle Lakshman, Last but not the least... The gorgeous, the intelligent, the proud, the talented, the majestic, the stylish… Daring the Bollywood heroines… we have, Keerthana Vasudevan. I welcome you all, in this momentous occasion. Round of applause, please. Madam... I came to your office. Without your permission, I entered your room. With nobody around, when you were alone, I laid a hand on you, Madam. Way to go, stud! Woot! Woot! I'm sorry, madam. I don't understand. Is that a double entendre? No, no secondary meaning. I was direct. Please forgive me Madam. At first, I didn’t feel anything... - Uncle! - Madam.. - I only realized it later... - The other day, he grabbed my hand right? - Yes. - Tell him to talk about that. He’s rambling. - On it. I'm apologizing with such respect, I believe you'd return it. Don’t you have stage manners? No Sir. You pushed madam in office remember? Apologise for that. Sorry Sir. Thanks for the reminder. I’ve told him madam. I apologized to Madam for laying a hand on her. But for provoking me, madam would like to apologize now. - He flipped it, mam. - That was the message relayed. Who would be so magnanimous? Am I right? Yes. Round of applause. Let's hear some energy! You crashed into my bike. You fired the actor. When I intervened for her, you tried to hit me. You have caused all the trouble. But I need to touch your feet and apologize? Go to h... - Hey! Is what I should rightfully say. But I’m not angry at you. Have no idea why. Maybe... Hassles and hustles abound heaving them all towards their end, Along you came, leaving me spell-bound blaring out a new trend. Slow down damsel, My heart's in a dandle, Girl can we chat up? Easy now, don't flare up. Here goes my Glitzy Daisy, Making my knees go shaky, Tempting to get clifty, With you, I'll be crafty. Here goes my Glitzy Daisy, Making my knees go shaky, Tempting to get clifty, With you, I'll be crafty. Your blush is a splendor, when flush with anger. When I'm all calm, why do you throw napalm? Last in the lineage of Cleopatra, with a generous dosing of Hydra. Knocks my head for my candour, Her reproaches are obscure. Even men who play with nuclear, when in love will go unclear. Slow down damsel, My heart's in a dandle, Girl can we chat up? Easy now, don't flare up. Here goes my Glitzy Daisy, Making my knees go shaky, Tempting to get clifty, With you, I'll be crafty. Here goes my Glitzy Daisy, (Glitzy Daisy!) Making my knees go shaky, (Knees go shaky!) Tempting to get clifty, With you, I'll be crafty. Here goes my Glitzy Daisy, Making my knees go shaky, Tempting to get clifty, With you, I'll be crafty. Here goes my Glitzy Daisy, Making my knees go shaky, Tempting to get clifty, With you, I'll be crafty. Here goes my Glitzy Daisy, Making my knees go shaky, Tempting to get clifty, With you, I'll be crafty. Here goes my Glitzy Daisy, Making my knees go shaky, Tempting to get clifty, With you, I'll be crafty. The mess they got me into. God, it’s so painful. They are done. Hey, what's happening here? (In Unison) Sir you asked us never to show our face, Sir. It’s better to see your face than buttocks. About turn. Both would look the same for you. Like a punctured truck tyre. Sir, forgot to wash off your soap while bathing. - No dude, that’s a baby’s diaper. - Oh, it threw it on his face. Don’t divert the topic. The pictures that we took on Asha’s birthday. Who asked you to post on FB? Sir we confirmed with you. What? When you were smooching Asha … - Hey! Sorry, scooping cake for Asha, Mano asked if he can put it on FB. You gestured... Shall I put it on FB? Sorry? Shall I put it on FB? Why are you yelling? Go ahead. I thought you asked about depositing in FD. We meant FB. - Can’t you say Facebook? - Can’t you say Fixed Deposit? Let it slide Sir. Is there any problem? Problem? Hey chubby, Why are you looking very sexy today? Already two play, you want one more? I know everything. What happened at the office? You know, that girl, Asha. She’s very dusky, but very pretty. Today is her birthday. So I ordered a heart shaped cake and we cut it. She took the arrow, I took the cake dear. Was that all? Nothing more to it? That fluffy was stubborn in wanting a selfie with me. Mano took some 7, 8 photos. And put it on Fb without my knowledge. Insubordinate idiot. Was that all? Nothing more to it? - I’m not eating this, am I? Nothing else dear That's all there is to it? Is there anything you'd like to add? Get ready Kuthalam. Tell me, dear. Asha is quite jovial, always smiling. I gave her a gift of 50 Thousand in FD. Fifty Thousand? That was all that was there in the account dear. I thought you knew everything. So I spilled it now? Can I at least eat before…? Ready dear. Your time starts now. Long time desire, darling. Yes. Come on. Why dude? - Why are you behaving like a high school kid? - Aren't you behaving like an elementary school kid? No answers right? Can’t say? You won’t let me say. Goodness me! The bank is asking back the loan? Kungumam show Sowmiya... Hello Sowmiya! Hello Mano. I was just in a meeting trying to get you a job. Job? It’ll be ready in one, one and a half week. Ok? Mano, it's alright. I’ve landed a bigger show. With a better salary. I wanted to tell you this. It’s all because of you Mano. It’s alright. - Take the last right. So why don’t you call your ex-boss Keerthana, and laugh at her? Laugh at her? No, no… I meant her in person and apologized. We had a good laugh about it. She's past it. Wished me all the best. Why don’t you apologize to Keerthana madam? Why the unnecessary fuss? It’s for your good Mano... - Sowmiya madam... Your route is clear now, have a good ride. Don't start advising like Oprah Or I’ll pay you a visit to your shooting spot. I didn’t mean it that way, Sorry. What was that? Keerthana was the troublemaker. She wouldn’t say sorry. But I have to ask her sorry? Even I think the same. - Think what? - Say sorry to her. Why are you all scared? What can she do? What can she do? - Mano! Hey Mano! What’s wrong mom? What’s wrong with Keerthana? You apologized on stage right? Do you tell your mom everything? Is that important now? Go on, mom. She has sued us for One Million Rupees. Why don’t you borrow a million from your manager Kuthalam Sir? Mom, he won’t lend 10 rupees for a tea. You want a million from him. Mother, who’s your Maths teacher? Why? I wanna know. Teacher Kumarasamy. I guessed so. Is this One million? It's Ten Million. (In Unison) Ten Million? - Yep, Ten Million. If you react in unison, will the problem vanish? Will we get Ten Million, if we sell our house? Our house owner would know better. Oh... - Om Muruga. Wish Thanos was real. - What are you mumbling? - Why are you rambling? Do you want this solved or not? Of course. Promise your mom that you won't mess with Keerthana. Swear it. Swear on me. Stop. Show me the other hand. Knew it. Promises with fingers crossed don’t count? Stop being childish. Swear on her. Mom! He has sworn. Who’s the advocate? Mr Arjun Reddy. Name is majestic. He looks that way too. Hi. (In Unison) Whatever it takes. Nice to see you bro. - (Pay for tea) He'll pay, wait. You have come in an ambulance. Reddy… - Sri Reddy? My cousin Prakash Reddy. Was consulting for him. Got delayed. Vehicle got punctured. Asked him for help. Said ‘cease ambulance’. Seize it? He said take my ambulance in Telugu. - Oh ok. - So took a ride with it. He is… Oh is he the convict? Not yet, just an accused. My friend Mano. - Hi, Hello Don’t worry. We are winning this case. Arrange for a success party. I’ll go see Padhu. Hearing is up next, he wants to go see Padhu? Who is she? Judge Padhmanabhan is what he meant. He calls judge by a nickname? This is just the beginning. Lots to follow. Keerthana. You are summoned, come. Laughing all the time. "The truth is defined by it's..." (Classical Tamil Poetry) Err... you know the rest, Your Honour. This is my client, Manohar. Vanakkam Sir. - Objection your Honour. He hasn’t even begun yet. What is your objection? He should not advocate. He doesn't have the rights. What is this nonsense your Honour? Who says I don’t have the right to talk? I did. Are you deaf? - What? How dare you? - Order, order.... Silence! Your Honour, I’m submitting important documents regarding this conversation. Madam... Mr Arjun Reddy. Yea it’s me. What is this nonsense? You have 12 backlogs in Law College. You haven’t graduated yet. - Backlogs? Your Honour, is this how you question a sincere lawyer? - What's going on? “ Are you qualified?” you ask me. Have you have practiced with counterfeit certificates all these years? Cheating. Fraud. Your Honour... - Your Honour... Is he not an advocate? - No. Sir just give me two minutes. I’ll kill him and surrender in this same podium. Sir, just give me a minute. I’ll kill him and surrender in that podium. Your honour… Hello Inspector, take him into enquiry. Mr Manohar, stretch this case for 6 months. I’ll cheat my exams and graduate. Then I’ll take over, don’t worry. Excuse me. Can I have an advance payment of 5000 rupees? Halfwit, couldn't even graduate. Ask him to get out first. - Get lost. Bad manners. Can we go shopping like in Bangalore? Fraud Cheat. I wouldn't have shared Wi-Fi had I known this. If you look pissed when I should be, I'd calm down. That’s your logic. No darling. Scold me, come on. I will never scold you. - Thanks Taking your dumb advice… I should scold myself. Look at her. She’s enjoying our tomfoolery. If I lose this case… - I’m finished. Give me your hand. Darling, you won’t lose. You’ll definitely win. I’ll make sure of it darling. Young man... Yes darling. - Sorry? Sir... Would you like an extension? Finish it in the next hearing? I'm a fan of John Grisham... know a few things about law. So can I please advocate on my behalf? Sir, he doesn’t hold a degree. How can he advocate? He can. There are provisions in the law. Sit back and enjoy madam. Proceed. Your Honour, can you please summon Keerthana Vasudevan? I have a demonstration for you. If it is just a demo, use someone else. Somebody else... Not her. Excuse me, your Honour. Carry on. Darling. Perform like Keerthana in this demo. I can’t perform like a woman. Are you a friend? Had it been Auto Sekar here... He would play act? - Definitely. But we can’t bear to watch it. It would suit you darling. You are a brilliant actor. Flattered. I’ll call out, “Keerthana Vasudevan can you please come”? Perform well. - Better than Mrs Doubtfire. I’m starting the demo Sir. Proceed. Keerthana Vasudevan. Damn. Killing it. Stop ogling. Dude, hit me. I’m so embarrassed. I didn’t ask you to hit on me. Hit me. Did you see that you Hon… We were hasty. An action replay for you, your Honour. Duuuuude, hiiiittt meee. - Yyyyyou loooussy rrrogueee. Statue. Now your Honour, This is Keerthana Vasudevan. This is her hand. When she raised her hand, To protect me, In self-defense, I laid my hand on her. This is what I meant about laying a hand. "A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush" they say. Who's the birdie? Did you see that? Half our folks twist simple words into filthy ones. Likewise, when I apologized for laying a hand, They said I laid a hand and sued me your Honour. Exactly, your Honour... he was direct and insulting. Please watch the video again, Sir. I have watched it many times. Go on. Sir... Jallikattu, Methane, Ethane, Neutrino, Hydrocarbon, Gasoline prices, Farmers’ distress, Cauvery Management, NEET, Sterlite, 8 way road etc are all protests in TamilNadu. All these cases are in pending. In this scenario, they have cooked up a case and, have wasted the court's time, your time and my time. Putting all of us under undue stress is this Keerthana Vasudevan and co. After all this, if their stature wins in the end, then I would be pressed to file a case, Sir. On what grounds? Sir, she filed a defamation case on me, Likewise I would file for not knowing what constitutes defamation. How can you do that? Have some sense! When others sue saying, they don't know “scheme”, can I not repeat it, Sir? Does it bleed blood for them and ketchup for us? Mrs Nirmala Sethuraman, any further arguments? Sir if you dismiss this case, we would contest in Supreme Court. Is it? The case is dismissed. Try your luck in Supreme Court. The court is adjourned. Madam definitely we can take... Dude... I saw your video on Whatsapp. Too good. What video? - Your Tik Tok video. Oh that one. Come here. Keerthana! You might enjoy losing to me, But winning you is so boring for me. I won’t watch even game that’s boring. How will I play then? I like my games to be interesting always. Try better. Keerthana... You don’t fail when you fall. You fail when you don’t get back up. (Singing) (Singing out of chorus) Baby, she's not in sync like our minister. Which minister baby? I would get in trouble. Quite cautious baby. Baby... are you wearing a canopy? Embarrassing me, baby. My granny's. It was loose on her. So I flicked it. Baby are you speaking like an educated? I’m a second grader dude. - Yea right. Who’s that driving with high beam? Who are you? Baby, why is she here? Maybe wants some crackers. Show some swagger to her. Yep. I meant my swagger. - As usual, go on. Look at him, his head is all glossy under lights. Vanakkam Vanakkam Vana… - Same to you uncle. Globy, that’s his style. He won’t let you finish. On this auspicious time and day, Madam has come to visit your home. Oh. - Madam... why take the trouble? We could have visited you. Will you not invi… - Come in please. Welcome. Mom. Welcome. Have some sweets, madam. You wouldn’t have tasted this ever. Would have only seen them in showcases. Gorge on it later. Please sit down Madam. Welcome. Don’t be too respectful kid. Have a seat. What’s with you? - Style! Uncross your legs. What's the purpose of your visit? We have just come in, relax. Who is that? Is he your husband? Yes. He was working in transport. Died in an accident. Oh I’m so sorry. Are you employed? No. I was a tailor in an export company. Quit after chronic pain in the legs. Oh… tch tch. So sad. - This conversation is unnecessary madam. What do you want here? Tell us. Pick up that call. That’s my phone, my call. To pick up is my discretion. What’s your agenda here? You’ll know it when you pick up that call. Sir... Mano. A good news. Our showroom has been taken over by a new company. Super Sir. Also, a bad news for you. You were fired. Sir... What is the reason? - They said they’ll tell you in person. Don’t worry, I’ll back you. Bye. Said something about a meeting? It’s already underway. That new company is KV Enterprises. Keerthana Vasudevan Enterprises. That's the company, that took over your showroom, and fired you. Now you must be knowing who the new boss is. I fired you. You want to know the reason? I'll tell you. Number one, I didn't like your name. Manohar… yuck. Number two, I hate your attitude. Number three, I absolutely despise guys like you from the hood. That’s why. Aren't you middle class? Family is dependent on monthly salary. Keerthu madam, let me remind you. If they miss their monthly salary, the hardships they face in the first week... God have mercy on them. I'm tearing up already How are you gonna live? Uncle, they are shocked. Don’t pile on. Please don’t do that. Sorry Mam, I became emotional. Sorry. - Get a hold. Ok I feel sorry for you and your family. I think I should help out. Let me think. Keerthu madam... you are their saviour. If you desert them, they might come to wrong conclusions. Ok uncle, I’ll listen to you. Mano... you can be my driver. Also, you can be my cook. And you dusting…. I mean housekeeping. Uncle, let’s go. When I’m in Middle class homes, I feel suffocated. I don’t like how they smell. I think this is your longest stay in one. It’s a record! The kindness you shower on this family, Keerthu Madam I’m so proud. What nonsense is this? Had you been more respectful, would you be here? For all the insults you threw at me. Baldies are Rocky Balbaos. What just happened? They are threatening us in our homes. Did you see that? Close the colony gates. Let’s have an intervention. That’s our everyday life mom. Do I look like a janitor? Go to the cops, take them to court. I’ve just returned from that cycle. Incorrigible - Baby! What baby? She’s waiting for you outside. Mr Mano, I forgot to tell you the real reason for firing you. I’ll tell you now, listen. Should make you realize my stature, clout. Shouldn't I? Ergo. Is the game interesting now? Baby, is she a woman? She behaves like a ghoul. Playing in our own turf. Fired you, on top of it. I'm so pissed... Shall we troll her on social media? No? Let’s break her office down. No? How about battery? We have guys ready. No? - Baby…. Okay... Let’s kill her and go to jail. No, my granny will be alone. What do we do now? Say it. Keerthana Vasudevan will regret, meeting, speaking, and messing with Mano, her entire lifetime. I’ll make sure of it. What happened next? What are you gonna do? What happened next? Say it, don't make cry. What happened next? "Punish an evil-doer by shaming him with a good deed" (Thirukural) Said Thiruvalluvar. "Punish an evil-doer by shaming them instantly and relentlessly" Says Manohar. Keerthana! You finished this? Pee Pee? Wee Wee? And everything? You drank your tea? Nah... waste. Now please tell me. What happened next? "A maiden who is short on temper, ages quicker." What is this? I have to write subtitles now. The girl who gets more angry becomes grandmother so soon. Who said this? - Me When? - Now. Wow! Forget the petty fights, I decided to make her older, by making her angrier by loving her. To achieve that, I used her own route. I took the driver’s job. What?! Driver? Is there a better opportunity to see her everyday? What a situational song! Very romantic! Excuse me. Keep the phone in silent mode. No calls during driving. Madam, first day at a new job. So my family wants to wish me. Just this call please. Sister.! - Where are you? Your brother is busy. Call me later? Shoot, she insulted us in our homes. You took her job offer? Shameless. Smite her face. Sorry. She’s just a teenager. Has no idea what she just said. This should be the first and last time. No phones during driving. Auto Sekar! Didn’t I just tell you? But he won’t know it right? He’s my close friend. If I don’t pick it up now, I’ll hear about this all year. Don't pick it up now. Please, please. Just this one. Yes, baby. - Baby, Keerthana, who visited you... - Yes, Don't be deceived by her looks. She's uncouth. She can never be our family. Don't make friends with her. Not a teenager. Is fully aware of what he said. Stop the car. Why? Stop the car. I will stop only at the office. - Will you stop the car now or not? Ok ok. Have no idea how to park this. What? Will you step out? Give me the keys. Oh no, if you take the wheel while I'm riding shotgun, People might think we are a couple. Hey... You have been fired. Now, keys. Can’t return them. What the … It’s in the car. Please take it. Just kidding. Catch it! You... Keerthu dear, like a Test match on a rainy day, my life was sluggish. But after you showed up, it is now a T20 match on a sunny day with Gayle on fire! So? So, I've decided to propose you. Propose? You want to know the reason? I will tell you. Number One, I like your name. Keerthana Vasudevan. Wow! What a trendy name! Number Two, Your attitude, latitude, longitude, magnitude, ...altitude. I love them all. Number Three, I just love classy women like you. Now I am going to tell you the magic words. Keerthu dear... 8 letters, 3 words, One meaning. 8 letters, One meaning, 3 words. 3 words, 8 letters, One meaning. And that is... I love... Trying to escape? This ain’t over. You aren't naive anyways. Here I come. Hello, Dora! Dora? Who is this? Oh are we playing pretend? Don’t you know my voice? So Dora can't bear to look into my eyes? Running off, blushed. It’s okay. This is my number. Mark it as Mr Local. Sorry? When you are in the mood, call me, like me, subscribe to me. Keerthu, this season is ours. Ciao! All the best, dear. You said this one too many. Buy me tab, when you land this job. There are new shows on SunNxt…. Mom, I’ll call you back. Don’t forget the tab. Bye mom. Hey Jasha Ashmin. Hey, Mano! Darn, Asha Jasmin. What a surprise! How did you end up here? Life has to move on. Why are you here? Here to see HR Manager Balaji, interview. Okay. Go straight, first cabin. All the best Mano. Asha... Kuthalam Sir and Raja never return my calls. Are you in touch…? Don’t talk about them. I don’t want to speak to them ever. Kuthalam… what a cheapo. Did he misbehave with you? I knew it. Fatty’s chronicles. What did he do? He deposited 50 thousand on my birthday, remember? Yea. He wants that back. How cold? Bloody heartless fellow. It disturbed me a lot. Oh my. I've tried reaching you, but you never pick up. We'll continue this after the interview. - Will you be online at nights? No, I’m leaving town. - Escaped. HR Department…. So rude. You, Oooo….Om Shakthi. How did you end up here? So who’s the new deity? Fashion, bro. Stop kidding. Is it for Melmaruvathur? Obvious you dumb m…. Om Shakthi. I was fired, so I’m here for my interview. Why did you quit? F… Om Shakthi Om Shakthi. I didn’t quit, I was fired. Mr P Raja. Aye aye Mam. Is Mano, your close friend? Not just a regular friend. He means more to me. You’re terminated. I’m terminator? Get out. Om Shakthi. I’ll never forget this sacrifice. In another life…. Destiny should make me a hero and you my friend. You’ll realise my pains then. I was in your boots once. You chose not to move out of your comfort zone. I kept climbing… this interview. Looking for HR. Excuse me Sir, HR manager room…. Him again? Raja was my friend, he was thrown out. Okay. You weren't even my friend, Sir. Why did you lose your job? Why you are dismissed my boy Mr Manohar in this company? Come on tell me. I won’t give you a single reason. You know why? Because I’m terminating you also. Me? What the hell? Get out you clown. Oh my God. First you go finish the interview. Another we will talk. Dot. Bloody crap. Bloody fools. Alright forget lunch, let’s go breakfast. Sir, did Asha return your money…. - Get lost immediately. I can't see anybody. I’m requesting you, dinner or lunch? Sir flirting in the office. - Get in quick. Oh no. - Shut him out. No matter how far we get away, he always seeks us out. Even if you spell out your thoughts, he ain't moving anywhere. "Money given in charity..." Are you alright? I’m gonna say it anyways. "...won't make parity" Why did you ask Asha to return the money, Sir? I’m out of the relationship but my wife's having none of it. That’s why I want my money back. - Sir... She might hear you. Is Asha here? - There... chatting with token No 7. Let’s ask her. Hey calm down. Now she's a big deal. Shut it. Selfies should be outlawed. They are together? She broke-up? - Yep Hence flirting with the janitor? Keep quiet. He doesn’t know… please. Shall we do? Yes let's do. Sir he’s in penance. Hey we meant putting down papers. Why? You have a desk job here. Why do you want to be a paper boy? We are going to give the ‘resi-Ganesan’ letter. Why should we give Susi Ganesan, the letter? - I meant recognition letter. You meant resignation letter. Why? Because of you. What did I do? You are here. She’s gonna sniff you out, and buy this company. And chuck us out of here. It’s better if we leave first. Funny boys. I swear on the Samosas here, we have sorted our issues. Finished. - Super darling! But now, I've decided to mess with her by trying to woo her. - Finished. - Termination confirmed. Why don’t I start rearing cattle? She’ll figure that out. Let’s go join Swacch Bharath in North India? What's that? - Dissenter. Guys, guys... chill. It's just harmless one sided love. Front side or back side? - Language! Om Shakthi Om Shakthi. Is there any chance she would fall in love? There is no chance she even phones him. Romance is far off. - Good one! I know. What's Dork? Dora, Sir. Who’s Dora? My Keerthu. My nick name for her is... Dora! - What? - Darn it. Too much noise here. Hold on, I'll move. - Ok Did he just say we are noisy? Both of us. Had it been one, he would have been direct. Watch it. Sorry Sir. I thought of calling you. I just landed a job. With a better pay. Thanks to you. - (Singing) - Mano, Manohar. What are you doing? Ok I’ll stop. Manohar, are you free today? I'm busy for others. My schedule is always open for you, Keerthu. Ok then. Can we meet at Park Hotel, Rooftop restaurant in the evening? Nice! Moving our romance to the next step. Good improvement, good improvement. When will you be there? 7 'o' clock sharp. But I’ll be late… be around 8.30. Wait for me, ok? Ok. See you soon, Dora. Keerthana! - You are wanted! - Darn it. Interrupting all the time. Hi Keerthu! Wow! What a beautiful gaze! Vairamuthu in his poems…. Can you please sit down? Thank you. I knew this would happen. But this soon? I didn't expect... What would you like to have? Just your concern makes me swell and full. See, I’m barfing. “A good beginning is half-done”. Shakespeare's words? No. My manager Kuthalam’s mantra. This conversation is a good start. What’s next? Let’s move fast. Fruits? Secret behind glossy skin, maybe. Do you know who he is? I've seen him in "Supreme Saloon" banner. Local model, right? He is Mr Naveen Varatharajan. Has a golf course in ECR. Yearly 10 Billion turnover. Only child of Madras Cements’ owner. Madras cements? My friend Auto Sekar is building a house. He’s looking for inexpensive cement. Can you get him a discount, please? It’s ok. He’ll understand. Do you know him? He’s the one from the underwear ad, right? He is Mr Sunil Agarwal. Oh! Kajal Agarwal’s brother. Thought I've seen him somewhere. The only son of Fly Jet Airlines’ owner. Has an yearly turnover of 12 Billions. Owns an island in Dubai. Then have to be careful with Tsunami. At least, do you know this gentleman? You should have started with this guy. I know him. I see him everyday evening 6.30 at Saligramam. Saligramam? Yep. You know Kerala Chips near Surya Hospitals? He’s the chief baker there. Chetta. Why angry? Not him? Looks quite alike. He is Mr Varun Nair. MD of Sheela Palace. He’s running 7 Five Star Hotels in all the top most cities. Yearly 13.6 billion turnover. Flies everywhere in his private jet. So if...? Can I intercept, please? So if the pilot is on leave, he can't go anywhere. Everytime I speak, you keep interrupting, without any manners. Think you are funny? These gentlemen, proposed to me earnestly. But I have rejected them all, decently. Do you know why? Why? They were worthy of my rejection. When you proposed me, I didn't say a word. Any idea, why? No. You were not even worthy of my rejection. Grow up to deserve my rejection. You'll die of old age before that happens. Now get out. What is this crap? That’s not crap. I bought it on a online sale, for you. Dora, the explorer. Just take it and get out of here. No it’s okay. Keep this as a souvenir. Stupid. Dora! 450 rupees down the drain. Who's paying for them? Hi. Hello, how are you? - Fine. Hi. - How are you? I’m good. How are you? I’m good. So how are your shows? Couldn’t be better. One second It’s ok. We are No 1 in the ratings. - Oh! So we have planned a series in the US. Wow, my best wishes Keets. Thank you. Hello. Who is this? You are bothering. I’m Lakshman, Madam. Hello. - Uncle … Lakshman uncle. Oh, uncle!. You are calling from another number. What happened? I had an accident on Kathipara Fly-over. Broke my phone too. I’m calling from a Guard’s number.

It’s an emergency. - Ok madam. Are you there? No no, I’ll be there in 15 minutes. Call me once you reach there. - Sure mam. Thank you. Hello. Excuse me. Whose cart is this? You are blocking the road. Nonsense. (Imitating computerized voice in Telugu) (In Tamil - The customer you have dialed is busy eating, please call him later). Or, his Kulfi will melt. (In Lakshman’s voice – Keerthu Madam, I’m hurting). (My leg is hurting) Hello. Where do you think you are going? He said he’s gonna propose to you and asked for a Dora doll online. Today, he wants an ice cream cart for his proposal. Who pays for these? Obviously, you. You make TV shows, right? Pay up. Your “Thoppul kodi” show is a hit, isn't it? It's spare change for you. - Keerthana Vasudevan! Aren't you splurging on your makeup? Can't you pay this small tab? Can't you hear me? Huh? Hey... Answer it. Hello. Hello Keerthana madam? Yes tell me. This is Apollo ambulance driver. Where are you? - Do you want some? - Huh… err…. - Yes tell me. No, Wrong information. Sorry? Wrong information? Are you kidding me? Aren’t you educated?

Hello. - Hello. - Uncle. - Keerthu, why are you calling at this hour? I don’t care what you would do, I should never see Manohar ever again. Play it in. Pass it properly, baby. You know I didn't pass 2nd grade. Passing ain't my game. Hey, why didn't you score? - He's their goalkeeper. - Then why didn't you? He threw the ball at me. Sorry, bro. Was an accident. Let it go. He didn’t mean it. Look at his beard, like Aladdin's lamp. So boring. Not a good one? - Nope. I'll be back with a good one. Look here, it was me bro. This time meant it. Second time baby. They are not from our hood. Trying to block the game. We’ll handle them after the game. Come. You’ll handle? You'll run home after the game, won't you? Hey, I had to take a crap once.

The "Madam" who sent you, where is she? I saw your horoscope today, it said... Who let you in? Don't be too respectful kid. Sit down. - How dare you…. Listen. The day you fire him, you'll do well girl. Mind your language, call me girl ever again... What will you do, girl? Sending goons to bash me up, why would I mind the language girl? What nonsense? I never sent anyone. Are you mad? Oh no…. There was a high school teacher named Walter White, Turns out he was a Drug Lord. Sounds like that story. He’s with you all day. And you have him around . But you have no idea of what he does? Applause. What a performance! You know how highly I thought of you? Here, higher. But you stooped so low. Oh God, this guy is disgusting. Yes we are discussing. Today's discussion. Thought we would be all like “what’s up dude, let’s have a game of snooker?” I’m from the masses, came through public schooling and welfare schemes. Nothing can stop me. If I start playing dirty… you can’t take it. - How dare you…? - Shut up uncle. You sent sloppy goons and embarrassed my girlfriend. Who's your girlfriend? You are crossing your limits. One more word and I'll kill you. My bae just turned Annabelle! Watch it. - It's alright. I've seen her soft aggression. Watching her unleash it today, I'm scared uncle. Crap. Keep losing your temper and you’ll lose good guys like me. Be around with your coterie till your end. Listen. Not many would be frank to your face, like me. They'll hold a grudge and run over you with a truck, one day. Bro. Take care of the helmet bro. Idiot. Always with his Dora, Flora... Hey, did you just say Dora? I never mentioned it all this time . Did I? - Nope. See? So Dora is in your heart somewhere. (In Malayalam - I always knew it. Keerthu will come find Mano, one day. I’ll make sure of it. And I'll have my favourite Dora all to myself. Got it? Got it, uncle?). Goodbye. Keerthu mam... Let me take another crack at him. Have you ever been useful to me? No mam, I thought that through. I got men on parole… Shut up! I don't wanna see you ever again. Get lost. Haven't I told you to mind the sugar? - Hey! All these snacks are homemade. Mano loves them. - Yea they are so good! Nice, we were just talking about you. He promptly picks his phone, except while driving. That’s a good habit. Oh God. What are you looking at? Saw him when he was a kid. Now, he’s all grown up. Yea, I ate my proteins. Go wash your face son. Hey, come in. What? He’s loves playing sports... - I said come in. Football especially. He admires "lassi" Lassi? - Yea him. No, that's Messi. Oh ok. What’s up? What’s happening here? Who are they? You are being courted. So, put on your best dress. Wash your face. Put Vermilion Sorry, sorry have “Vibuthi”. Present yourself and wish everyone. And sing a song. (Singing terribly) Slap you. Call mom. - Weirdo. Everyone is fond of him. Especially, kids. Mom, brother wants you. Oh, one minute. ... we'll handle. What do you want son? Mom, are you serious? What have you done? How's the girl? Nice right? Who… asked for this? Did I ask to get married? You wanna get married, I know it. How do you say so? You are arguing everyday with Keerthana. Marry this Kavitha. Keep arguing every day, ok? Mom, both start with K! Keerthana, Kavitha. K and K. Yes! So change your dress quick. Come soon. Mom, Ma, Ma.... He asks if jeans is okay. Anything is fine aunty. Son, she says anything is fine. He consults everything. So innocent. I’m love with another woman. I’m planning to marry her. Son, what are you saying? Mom, you don’t know. I’ve not told you this. Mom, invited you out of ignorance. Please don’t mistake her. Sorry. It’s okay. No problem. Please don't insult anybody else. Mom, let’s move. You have no idea about your son. Is this how you raised him? Drop it brother. It is how fatherless homes are. Let’s go. - Move. Uncle, let’s try to sort things. - Such insult. Sir…. - Keep moving. Wait, what is this? By tradition, it should be us who should court them. But they didn't mind the formality, for me. Why did you behave like that? Why did you insult me? You did the same to me, by not taking my consent. Did I take your consent for your every need? Why should that change? So far no, but hereon you should ask. Mom, you are intruding. This is my life, I’ll take care of it. Your life? What has gotten into you? I raised you as a single mom, with such care. But you insulted me in front of our relatives. They were right. Fatherless home, right? Mom, mom. - Out of my way. Why bro? Mom! Hello. Keerthana. Yes Sir. - Is this a right time to call you? You have already called... Yes Sir, go on. We have changed your "Kungumam" show timings. From 8.30 pm to 1 pm. What? May I know the reason Sir? Didn’t you see our official email? Sorry, I was busy… must have missed it. It’s okay. Day by day, the ratings of your Kungumam show is dropping down. That's the reason. But Sir, we were just working on it. It'll improve in the upcoming weeks. So give us the prime slot please. Don't worry, if the ratings pick up, we'll consider. By the way, why did you change Sowmiya? The ratings were good when she was there. Anyway, it is your decision. But you can think about it. Thank you. Good night. Look at mom, brother. She's been here for a long time. She won’t mind if I argue with her. But with you, she becomes deeply upset. She hasn’t eaten anything. Come, let’s pacify. Mom... Brother has something to tell you. Oh God! Ma... Ma! I was out of my mind. Spoke out of line. Sorry ma. Ma, he is apologizing. Forget it. Let’s go eat. Bro! Mom! Mom I didn’t mean it. Why are you crying? Don’t cry ma. No, you weren't out of your mind. You were quite mindful. You have grown up. I didn’t realise it. You have always listened to me since you were kid. I thought you would continue to be the same. Sorry dear, sorry. I won't do anything without consulting with you. Ma, I still listen to you. So, you want me to marry your choice, right? Ask Anitha to come around tomorrow, we'll fix it. She’s not Anitha? Sunitha maybe? It’s Kavitha. Name is not the point. I’ll marry her tomorrow. You are trying to make me smile, aren't you? You know everything Ma! Super Ma! Come let's eat. - Come. Son, stop. Dinner can wait, who are you in love with? In love? - Yea. Me? - Yep. You must be kidding. I bluffed, mom. He’s bluffing now. Shut up. - Get out. Mom! I swear, I’m not in love with anyone. I cooked it up to send them away. True story. Ma, don’t think I’m out of line. You always are. Right mom? - Wrong. She's perfectly in line. Her? - Yep. You tell me. I can find out who is in his heart for real. There’s a game for it. Behold! The Grandmaster of Reverse Quiz Better than reverse quiz. I have read it on the internet. Close your eyes and imagine the things I say. Ok? I’ll pop a question. You should reply in an instant. We’ll find who’s your One, ok? Don't you read academics on the internet? She’s rambling. Let’s go mom. Hey... - Ma! She has a point. Ask him, dear. Close your eyes. Mom... Shut it. Shut your eyes. You have joined a bigger company. You are the head of the showroom. Who are you tomorrow begins with what you do today. Good morning ladies and gentlemen. An important presentation… You hold the floor. All eyes on you. Our mission is to become world leader in this field. Just then your phone rings. Mom on the line. Excuse me guys. Mom! - Mano, your wife is in labor. When? Just now. Come quickly to the hospital. Ok . - Quick. I’m on my way. You excused yourself and hurried… You wanted to see your wife and child badly. You were stressed with their well being. You ran to your car. Sped out of there. Stressed to the limit on your way. Despite traffic, you arrived quickly at the hospital. Running towards the reception, you asked for the room number. Room no 318. Third floor. Third floor? - Yea. Shunning the elevator, you took the stairs. Looking frantically for the room... Finally, you found it. Anxiously, you opened the door. Your wife was there with your child. Tell me who did you see? Say it brother. Who did you see? What are you thinking? Mom, you sleep after dinner. I’ll be back. Mano, Mano... Mano say something. Mom! He's in love with Keerthana. How sure are you? 100 percentage. How? You are old-school Ma, you won't get it. Old-school? Keerthana. Sorry Keerthana. Sorry for everything. All these days, I've hurt you. I will never do that again. I'm... I’m really sorry, Keerthana. First you embarrassed me. Then you irritated me, trying to woo me. Now you have started a sorry. Who are you? Why are you harassing me? I’m not here to harass you... Keerthana. Forget it. I don’t wanna argue. I don’t know how you will respond. But... I want to pour my heart out. I needed peace for a few moments. You have spoiled... - Keerthana, just a minute. Please hear me out. Arrgh... This guy is irritating to the core. Keerthana Keerthana! I admit that I have irritated, tortured,embarrassed you. Laughed at you. But this is different. Without even realizing, I think I have fallen…. I want to tell you what's on my mind right now. I love you, Keerthana. Keerthana, Keerthana... Please, kee…. Hey! If you say yes, While we hold hands, A light fills my universe. If you throw me a smile, In love that’s not vile, My soul walks the heaven's aisle. Auto! One day these troubles will go away, Looking back, we’ll laugh it all away. One day these troubles will go away, Looking back, we’ll laugh it all away. If you say yes, While we hold hands, A light fills my universe. The road I took led me into a maze, With you by my side, I wouldn’t faze. I wanna let it all out, It’s just a veneer, do not doubt. Your furrows, Cut in my heart, deep furrows. Would you believe this jolly good fellow? If you say yes, While we hold hands, A light fills my universe. If you throw me a smile, In love that’s not vile, My soul walks the heaven’s aisle. You got off. Keerthu madam is out of danger. Doctor said she’s safe. Since the day you met her, everyday has been chaotic. Look... if you wish her well, never show up again. Leave. Also, let’s not tell her that you gave her the blood. We can’t be sure of how she will react. You can leave. Why are you waiting? Get out. You didn’t go to see her? Is this the end of the story? Nope. This is the beginning of a new story. She came to see me. What? I was shocked too. Excuse me. This is Mano’s home right? I think I’m at the wrong house. Sorry. Keerthana. Hey Mano! Hi. You look startled. How are you? How do I appear? I'm all fine now. Should I return home or can I enter… Please come in. Lakshman uncle is not here. Welcome! Welcome! Hey.... Don’t worry. I’m not gonna fire your son. You don't have to worry. That’s my sister Divya. Doing her facial. But this is better. Shut up. Mom... Please come in. Have a seat. Clown... Excuse I’ll go wash my… Don’t mind me, you can keep it on. Thank you. So, how are you feeling now? Feeling much better, aunty. Is it ok if I call you aunty? No problem, your wish. Aunty, I caused a lot of trouble in your home last time. Please forget it. Why should we remember them? Water under the bridge. Mom and I wanted to see you in hospital. But brother said let’s not disturb her. Oh, you could have come. That’s not disturbance. We have a guest here. Go make some tea. Unbelievable! I made tea for the woman I love. What’s your problem? Let’s see how long this lasts. - Will last forever. Thank you. Green tea. Practicing. Aunty, had it not been for your son. I wouldn’t be here now. That’s why I wanted to thank in person. Mano thank you so much. That’s unnecessary. I’m sure anybody would have done it. Right ma? Maybe they would have gotten an ambulance. But you…. Carried me up and into the auto... Your hands were trembling. I knew. Your shirt had blood all over it. Memory is quite hazy. I still get nightmares. Thank you so much Mano. When we heard of it, we were worried. I can’t imagine it for your parents. My parents passed when I was a kid. My uncle and aunt raised me. They are overseas now. I was in boarding school my whole life. Now I’m busy with my business. For a woman, a single woman…. The heights you have achieved are admirable! Mano, my uncle wants to talk to you. Do you have a couple of minutes? 2 minutes? I can spare an hour . Please call him. Please... Hello, dad. I’m at Mano’s house. Would you like to speak to him? Yes, please. Hello. How are you Mano? You have saved my daughter. I don’t know how to thank you. Just say thanks Sir. No Mano, that won’t suffice. I’ll book tickets to Paris for your whole family. - How's the tea? I have to do something for you. Your family is welcome. - Sure Sir! It’s my strict order. I’ll return it to Keerthana. Ma. Bring everyone ... He invited us all to Paris. Is he in Parrys corner? Aunty... please Whatsapp your passport details. I’ll get visas for you. Passport? For us? We don’t have them. He applied for passport after 10th grade for God knows what. Ok, then please allow Mano to go at least. You still have your passport? I have sent you my passport copy on Whatsapp. You can process my visa. Will help you buy tickets. See you mom. Sooner the better. - Ok. It’ll be a short trip. Oh! Aunty, a small gift for you. Why take the trouble? Well played, mom. This is for Divya. For Divya? Come out soon. - Yes I’m coming. Look... Take this. For you. - Thank you. Hey, don’t peep. What happened? Nothing. Not a… thing. Ok bye. See you. Goodbye, aunty. - Bye. Look at you. - Ma, please. Go. (Singing) What is he doing? Show me your gift. Your…. I didn’t mistake you. You have gotten them simple gifts. You're gonna buy me costly gifts. I’m not following you. You gifted them but… I wasn’t talking about it. Then? Your tea was very good. I was waiting to tell you that. Oh thanks! Not just tea, I make delicious Chicken Biryani. My neighbor lady steals my Chicken Biryani. My mother often says, that my future wife is a lucky one. Your mother got that right. Bye. Attention everyone, it's your Captain speaking. We are taking off! Hi. Hi. I want window seat. Shall we exchange seat? No, I can’t exchange. Even I prefer window seat. Why you vomit? Sorry? No, you put head outside the window and vomit? Like... Nonsense. What nonsense? Sixth sense. What’s happening Mano? Please come. I asked for the window seat, she’s quite stubborn. Oi, I’ll come and keep you. Sorry? I said I’ll get the seat back. Booked tickets at the last moment, they had only one Business Class seat. Would you like to take that seat Mano? I’ll manage here. Oh, come on. Flying in and of itself is a luxury to me. Business class suits you better. I’ll learn French from her. Nice jacket. Thanks. Nice hairstyle. Nice earring. Nice lipstick. Nice... Nice dress. Matching, matching…. Dora! Just wanted to see if you respond to Dora. Quite a strong response! Can I call you Dora? When she looks into my eyes, A million miles my heart flies. In her smile, lays a twist lands a thousand pound fist. Girl, don’t wink, Makes my heart blink. All this flutter, will make it weaker, Aren't you eager? Don’t look over so fast, slow down. My heart is on the line, you’d mow down. Every look is a new high, So addictive, on the sly. Girl, don’t wink, Makes my heart blink. Girl, don’t wink, Makes my heart blink. All the cars I upsell, Dot the roads till Winterfell. We’ll ride to our wedding bell! Oh, yea! I’m the biggest hustle, Nothing stops me, don't hire a muscle. The missives I send are heavy for a missile. What’s up, girl? Milk is all white and bright, In a day, it goes expired. Honey is all dark and brown, Honey, I’m honey always unspoiled. Don’t look over so fast, slow down. My heart is on the line, you’d mow down. Every look is a new high, So addictive, on the sly. Your smile, launches me a mile. That wretched ego, Let us forego. Tik tok is out of clock, I’ll play a new Bach, The concert will rock! Let’s start dating, Our selfies are winning. When our eyes keep going wow, It’s time to take the vow. Don’t look over so fast, slow down. My heart is on the line, you’d mow down. Every look is a new high, So addictive, on the sly. Hello. Hello. Hi, aunty. I want to tell you something. Are you free now? To me? Tell me aunty. My son likes you very much. Is in love with you. Wishes to marry you. I don’t know if this will ever happen. I just felt like telling you. Please don’t mistake me. Definitely not, aunty. Soon I’ll have a good news for you. Tell me soon! What’s that good news. Hey, weren’t you sleeping? Eyes only closed, ears always open. Aunty and I have many things to discuss. Why do you wanna know? You are such a tease! Where are you going? To get our luggage. Never mind, they will take care of it. Our luggage is our responsibility. The hotel is ours. Ours? Mine. 50 percent share. The other 50 percent? Ashwin. Has another 8 such hotels. One of the best hoteliers in Europe. Oh! Can I see him once more? Yea, looks handsome! Is everything okay, Roya? Yes Mam. - Excuse me, Roya. - Yea. I want two plates of Idiyappam with Paya. Okay. Mano... I have something important to tell you. Your uncle and aunt are busy and will be late. Right? We have all day... I was gonna say... I love you. I. Love. You. Mano... I have a wish. After our marriage, I wanna quit the business. Be a housewife. I wanna cook for you. Have a couple of cute babies, with you. Also... Wear the sarees you'd like, wear some flowers, and visit temples with you on your bike. Take care of your mother, you sister... Tend to the family. Get your sister married to a wealthy family. After our wedding... you should take care of all my businesses and properties. Will you do these for me, Mano? Heard of being speechless, but this is my first time experiencing it. I can barely contain my happiness. Imagine my mother listening to this! Give me your phone. We'll find out! Go on, tell her. This was her plan all along, anyways. She'd be delighted to hear this. What do you mean, Keerthana? The plan is to get acquainted to a rich girl, be friendly with her, earn her trust, marry her and swindle... what do you call it... yea, flick all her money. Move up the class stratum, become high class for the next 5 generations, who wouldn't have to work a day in their life! This is your plan, right? You are out of your mind, Keerthana. I'm fully aware now. I'm telling the facts. You'd curse me to be "run-over" the same day I'd get run over by a truck, "saved" by your blood, now I should fall in love and marry you? Wow! What a sketch! I'm quite impressed you know? What are you looking at? Heard of being petrified. Watching it for the first time. I know a few things about you. You are quite frank. So I was thinking about the man behind this wicked plan, in the hospital. When your mom called me, it was obvious. I have a doubt... Why did your mother choose to be single, given how well she plans? Could have easily trapped and married a rich guy. Roya! Mam? - Did you call the cops? Yes. Fill up the details, Roya. - Sure, mam. Didn't you say Ashwin is handsome? Well, I'm gonna marry him. I came here to meet him. Did you think we are on a foreign tour? If you wanna fool around, be mindful of your level, status. These are the consequences, otherwise. This is a lesson for you, Mr Mano. Officers... (In Malayalam - Hey Mano! Have you seen this country's prison? It's very good! Off you go, bye.) Here's your passport. This is your visa. And ticket copy. You have 24 hours, to leave our country. It's a sad ending to a story. Manohar! So by this time your girlfriend is already meant to be married, right? Yep. Don't worry, bro. If one Keerthana goes, one Katherine will come. Damn... The state of me, taking advice from the likes of you. What? Err... I'm trying to say "Thank you" in my language My pleasure bro. See you. Take care. Antony! Huh? - Is this your bike? - Yea. Can you give it to me for two hours please? Where are you going? I'm going to see my girlfriend and say... ... Goodbye. Crap. Get the car. Come baby, let's have a beer and talk. You are being rude with your fiancé. Aren't you ashamed? Who are you? I'm... My name is Manohar. No titles as yet. Could use one when needed. What do you want? If Keerthana is in trouble, I become so happy. But I can't wait to know what is her problem here. Actually, I'm very excited you know! Keerthu dear, park this bike over please. Remember, you started this. Guys! Get him. Keerthana madam! You hyped up your fiancé. Hotels in Paris, Private jets, Billions. Here you are fooling around in the middle of a road. Is it a hobby? Tell me baby. Hi. How are you? - Fine. Guys... Keerthana... You're looking so beautiful! Thank you so much. Do I look handsome? Yea. Thank you, thank you. So how goes your theatre troupe? Are you a travelling troupe or do you have your own place? Excuse me. It's not a theatre troupe. It's a television production house. It's a corporate company. And we are Number One in the industry. - Oh! Corporate company! Number One! How much profits do you clock, annually? About 500 Million Indian money. You are so funny. What did you say? 500 Million? Indian money? Annually? That's my tab on a weekend party. You call that a profit margin? Peanuts. Keerthana. Do one thing... After our wedding, you wind down your threatre troupe. Ok? Excuse me. I told you it's not a... - Yea, yea, whatever, whatever it is I don't care. My wife cannot be soap handler in a laundromat... What? Oh sorry. I meant producer of Daily Soaps in TV, would be an embarrassment for my status. Excuse me. Nobody has the right to dictate my business. Because it's my passion, my hard-work and my self-respect. Oh, she's such a Feminist. And I hate Feminism. Mr. Ashwin, I don't think this is gonna work out. I really need to leav... - Hey, listen... listen You're going to get married to a rich guy like me. Then why do you need this wretched troupe? Hey! Idiot, moron, imbecile, bonehead... Don't you have sense? How many times should I repeat that this is a Production house. What the hell! How dare you talk to me like that? Do you have any sense? Is this how you behave with the girl... Guy, you are gonna marry? I hate you. I hate you. I hate you. I hate you. Get out of my life. What are you staring at? Out. Idiot - Oh God! I'm... I'm so sorry. Just use this please. Use this please. Just leave me alone. - Okay. I'll show you the washroom. Quite nearby. Come, come. Hey! What are you doing? Oh! Force of habit. You carry on. Habit? What's going on? Excuse me. What do you mean by "Force of Habit" ? I wanted to surprise you on our wedding night. Now it's all ruined. Gotta reveal it. Till last year, I was a woman. Named Ashwini. Then I underwent a surgery in Bangkok. Now, Ashwin. There's a slight snag. Whenever I get emotional, Ashwini's voice comes out. It should be fine, soon. What are you thinking? If you doubt me, spend the night with me. And I'll show you the magic. Move. Keerthana madam! Spent so much to teach me a lesson. But looks like you spent to learn, God's lesson. My mom often says that, if two girls are alone, they'd soon pick a fight. She got that right, didn't she? Picked a fight right in the middle of the road. Buying a foreign car is not a big deal, Keerthana. Gotta check out if it is compatible to our roads. Karma is a boomerang! Let's hear your list of reasons, now. Oh shut up! Huh? I didn't say anything. I don't know what you think of me, Keerthana. But I like you so, so much. Your beauty, swagger, style, attitude... All of it... I love all of you. I have admired this every minute of us being together. To see the woman I admire being harassed... I'd have knocked him out... spared him because he's your fiancé. You know what my mom said to me? "You don't have a father but you have me and Divya." "But Keerthana has nobody to call family." "That's why she's so obtuse." "If she got the same love you did, she'd be great. Don't trouble her anymore." Even I had the same thoughts coming here. To hear you, think of us in such vulgarity... It's a waste of time explaining to you. When you go back to Chennai, find a guy who matches "your level, your status", marry him and be happy. Bye Keerthana. Keerthana, let's keep this between us. My mom admires you. She speaks very highly of you. She'd get hurt if she knows this. Please don't pick up her calls. Listen to me this one time, please... Customer satisfaction has always been our priority. Sales Manager Ashok will explain the Product Specs now. Thank you. Good Morning Ladies and Gentlemen. I'm Ashok. TATA Motors has launched a new model... Hey, why are you here? Mom, what happened? Divya, speak up. Why are you guys here? Shut up. Don't you dare speak. - Go, mom! Are you even my son? - Mom, why are you hitting me? People are watching... What else do you expect? Ma, what did I do? - How can I say that? Hey, tell him what he did. You are ditching her, after laying a hand on her in Paris. Ditching? Cross your heart, did you not lay on hand on me? Oh Lord! Yea I did. So? (Clamour) Aren't you ashamed? What is there to be ashamed of? Anybody would have did it in that situation. What situation? Shouldn't you have self-control as a man? It is not possible... - Shut up! Listen to this Aunty! -Yea, listen to her. "Whatever happened in Paris, shouldn't be known to my mom." He said. Didn't you say it? - Yep. Oh my... Shut up! Ma, hear me out... - Shut up! She is my Daughter-in-law. Oh no! - Yes! Not a word. Bring her home with dignity. Keep "Aarthi" (welcome ritual) ready. -Who's Aarthi? One more word and I swear... (indiscernible) Let's go - Yea, mom. Keerthana... I read on the internet. If you can say the date of the incident, I'll refer Chinese calendar... and let you know if the child is gonna be boy or a girl. I'll slap you. Always with your Internet games. Get lost. I'll call you, bye. Boy or a girl... Wait... What did you mean by "laying a hand"? Whatever you are thinking... My Karma is a boomerang too! Are you angry, honey? Honey? I'll... Calm down. - Why are you doing this to me? I apologized with your mom and asked for your hand. She said I have to consult my son, first. Hence... You said I'm not even worthy of your rejection. What now? Are you planning to send my family to prison? Speak up. After our last meeting, Divya called me. She talked about "The Love Game". Love game? You are married. You are expecting. This is your ninth month. You are in labor pains, on your way to the labor ward. You have an uncomplicated delivery. When you regained consciousness, nurse let you hold your baby. You were very happy looking at your child. You badly wanted your husband to see your child. You were waiting for him. You heard the door open, looked reflexively at it. Now tell us Keerthana, who did you see as your husband? Not a chance. Not. A. Chance. I may have become your Dream Guy. But you are not my Dream Girl now. It's too late. To accept someone on their flattering side is quite common. But to be accepting of flaws... That's quite rare. So I wanna... I understand. Since you are pleading... I'll consider it. I'd take a room here, deliberate on the Pros and... Ok, you have the final word. Come here. - Hello Keerthana. Brother is not picking up. Can you give the phone to him? Your brother is busy. It's an emergency. Give it to him, please. Your sister has something urgent to say. - Hello. Hello. - Hello, bro! I don't know you. Wrong number. This is unfair, bro. As you instructed, I called Keerthana at the right moment and played the Love Game. As promised, I want my motorcycle. Or, I'll tell on you. Hello... are you there? Hello. I know I'd be in your dreams... Just tried to make you realize it. Mr Manohar... Your mum just beat the hell out of you. Guess, it'll change after wedding. Keerth... Keer... They'd slip up a thousand times, we should just forget it. We'd slip up once and never hear the end of it. It's gonna be fun! Mr. Local is ready to play husband! Keerthana... What's happening there? - Nothing, dear. Bye, bye. Come here. - On the way, dear.
