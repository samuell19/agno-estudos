RIP-FIXES-SYNC VaVooM You don't need to push so hard. You're going to jam your wrist. Let the sandpaper glide over the wood. Oh, OK. Max is a total construction savant. Did you know that when he was a kid, he'd build whole cities out of building blocks, and then he'd give tours. It's not true. I never gave tours. See, that's the difference between me and you. I used to charge my parents full admission for my fashion shows. You two are going to be running the world by the time you're 21. She's got dibs on the Oval Office. I'm still trying to get through high school. Why do you think we keep going back to this story year after year? What is it about these star-crossed lovers that's so compelling? Is it the fact that their parents hate each other? No, it's not really about the parents. Really? Yeah, 'cause when you're in love... And I'm not talking what they show on MTV. That's just a bunch of good-looking people having sex. That's not love. I'm talking the real deal. It's like your whole system get rewired. So you could be 15, like Romeo and Juliet or 20 or 40 or whatever. It doesn't really matter 'cause that kind of love, you don't really have a choice. It's like, I don't know, having blue eyes or being left-handed or whatever. You found your McDreamie. Hey, do you remember the first time that I saw you? It was grade 9, first day of school and you were wearing that faded blue t-shirt. Walking head-first into a pole. 'Cause you were staring at me. I was trying to play it so cool, I almost got a concussion. I still think you were going for a sympathy vote. - It worked, didn't it? - Insanely well. You are a lying, cheating reptile, Roger, and I am not going to waste another minute of my life arguing with you! Why don't we just let our lawyers duke it out, then! Hi, honey. - That was just... - Yeah. How was the party? Good night. - Hey! You made it! - Hey! You OK? Yeah. It's just my parents are total infants. You'd think the divorce would make them stop fighting. Instead, I think it just makes it worse. Between the two of them, I feel like Switzerland. Except without the hidden Nazi money. You know, when most people think of Switzerland, they go to chocolate, maybe watches, but not you. No. I wish we could do this every night. College will be different. I know, but I mean permanently, without roommates. Well, maybe my roommate will crack under the pressure and we can get one of those psycho singles. Sounds good. And if he doesn't, we can... - Psych him out? - Exactly. It's just a matter of time, you know? We'll have a blast at Harvard. Maybe even fit in a little studying. Maybe a little? Come on, this is my version of the future. Just let me enjoy the fantasy for a minute. We'll get one of those cool lofts, downtown Boston. You'll get into Harvard Med School, become an OK surgeon, probably go to jail for botching someone's breast implants, but I'll visit you every weekend for conjugal visits because I love you so much. Just kidding. You'll be a great surgeon. I'll get a cool job where I'll make tons of money and I can still shoot hoops on the weekends. That sounds amazing. Jess, you awake? I'm coming, Mom! I'm just getting dressed. Breakfast is almost ready. Yeah, I'll be there in a second. Maybe your mom slept in. Are you kidding me? My mom never sleeps in. I love it when you sleep over. Enjoy the memory because I'm going to be grounded till I'm 60. Go! - Rough night? - No. Sounded like you were thrashing around in bed. Must have been having some active dreams. Mom, the tea smells great. There's more in the pot. You can have some. So when are you supposed to hear from Harvard? Any day now. I hope they need a huge deposit so your father has to delay construction on his new house. I'm just kidding. Just kidding! - So, Dad... - I've got an idea. Why don't we all go to tennis camp for Spring Break? I hate tennis. OK. - Sorry I'm late. - Babe! How are you girls doing? You know, keepin' it real. Fine, thanks. Have you told them yet? No, but I guess there's no better time than the present, huh? Kelly and I are getting married. I know this is probably hard for you but I want you to know that I love your dad very much. I hope we can all get along. We can all get along. Besides, Kelly and I are pregnant. How far along? Six weeks. Nice. You mind checking on her and making sure she's OK? Thanks. Just... No, no, no. I'm not telling Mom. I'm sure it would go down just a little easier coming from you. Hi. God... I think I'm going to be alone for the rest of my life. Don't say that. There are worse things. Like being bored to death. This guy tonight... He collects stamps. And talks about it incessantly. Oh, God... Your father's a scumbag, but at least he makes me laugh. How was dinner? Pretty much what you'd expect. I love you, Mom. What brought that on? I just... I guess I just don't say it enough. I love you too, baby. I don't know what I'd do without you. He actually expects me to tell her about Kelly and the baby. Sorry, babe. It's like Holly and me, all those years he was with my mom, they didn't mean anything. Come here. We'll never be like that, OK? You'll always come first with me. Yeah, you too. You're like my home. Hold on. Hello? There's an envelope from Harvard and it's big. Yeah, just wait till... No, no. OK. No, open it now. Yeah, open it now. I got in! I got in! Of course you did, babe. It's early admissions, babe. You're a goddess. Thanks, Mom. OK, I'll see you later. Amazing. Call your house. OK. My mom's probably not even home, but... Hey, Mom. Jessica got into Harvard. She says congratulations. Thank you. My envelope is small. They're just morons. OK. Yeah. Yeah, OK. Thanks. I got deferred. You'll get in in April. Yeah. No, seriously. I know that you will. OK. Well, that's your problem, Roger, not mine! Freedom has a price! Oh, right! You ever remember them happy? Before you were born. It was like bliss. I'm serious. This one time we went to Vermont and we built a huge snowman, straight out of a Christmas card. Rocks for eyes, carrot nose, plaid scarf. Dad was there? Yeah. He took out a Swiss army knife and he trimmed the perfect carrot into a nose. No bumps whatsoever. And then we went skating and they actually held hands. I don't remember that. I was maybe 6, so you would've been 3. You couldn't really skate. I mostly walked around the pond and made sure you didn't fall in. We'll just let our lawyers talk about this, OK? Talk to my lawyer! That babe over there has got you in her sights. What? Over there by the counter, sprayed-on jeans, cleavage for weeks. Go for it, man. Son, I'd be all over that, except she's not looking at me. All right. Just give it up, OK? So, you really don't care, do you? What am I saying? You're practically already married. It's cool, man. Forget it. You're saying that like there's something wrong with it. I know she's the one. OK, I don't know what you're up to, but it better be good 'cause my fingers are freezing off. OK, it's Valentines' Day, so I'm risking being really cheesy here. Max, I'm a girl. When it comes to Valentine's Day, you can't be cheesy. And you got me chocolates, so you're already in the zone. Well, this last week has been kind of sketchy. Getting deferred. I didn't really see that coming. Hey, that's only temporary. You're going to get into Harvard in April, OK? You see? That right there, the way you said that, the way you make things happen instead of just talking about them, I love that about you. Hey, I'm a girl with a plan. What can I say? Yes, you are. Being with you, it makes me believe in myself, in us. I've been trying to think all day of a way to explain how I feel about you. You know, like a line from a song or a movie. I was all set to plagiarize Shakespeare, but even that seemed lame. See, when we're apart, separate, we're good. We're really good. But when we're together, it's just that much better. And we have all these plans, all these things we want to do together but that's just it: they're all just hopes now, none of them are real. But they will be someday, and it will be amazing. It'll be perfect... What are you doing? Come here. I know we're young, OK? And I know we have our entire lives ahead of us, but I don't want to waste another second of it without you by my side. Look... I love you, Jessica, and I've never been more sure of anything in my entire life. Marry me? Max... Just don't think about what's reasonable or rational or logical... Max! Of course! Stop! My hair! Sorry, just one second. What's your drama? I'll see you in a bit. What the... What's going on? You know, no big. Max just proposed and I said yes! Oh my God! Oh my God! Keep it on the downlow. When did he do it? What did he say? Did he kneel? Yesterday, and yes, he went down on one knee. And he gave me this. But it's only temporary. That is the most adorable thing. What was it like? At first I couldn't breathe. And then it felt like the most natural thing I've ever done. That is so romantic. What about Harvard? That's still happening. Nothing's going to change. My head is spinning! What did your Mom say? Yeah... I haven't told her just yet. What do you got in there? OK. Right here. It's so pretty! OK, so if we were to win the lottery tomorrow and we were just rolling in money where would you want to go for our honeymoon? Well, there's this place that I saw in a magazine, and the beaches, the sand was literally pink. And the drinks are pink too? Probably. What do you think your parents are going to say? My parents got married pretty young. They'll be cool with it. How about yours? I think they'll deal. Coming through! I see congratulations are in order. - Thank you. - Thank you. We're very excited. Wait a minute. Are you expecting? Yes! I can always tell. I'm due in August. Well, you're just full of surprises, aren't you? Anyway, what's this all about, huh? Well... Jessica and I got engaged. What? Are you pregnant too? No! You're off to college, your whole lives ahead of you. What's the rush? Well, we're still going to go to college. We know we want to be together. We don't see why we should wait. Plenty of people do it at college. It's not really an either-or thing. We're going to do both. Are you sure you're not pregnant? Positive. When were you planning to do this? - Now. - Now? But Jessica won't be 18 till next December so we need written consent. Good luck. We don't want to wait till next summer. Look, you've got a brilliant future. You're going to Harvard, OK? There's no way I'll let you throw that away just for him. Watch your mouth, Roger. Dad, we love each other. You're 17. You don't even know what that means. Like you're such an expert? When you're 18, you'll be able to do whatever you want. But until then, there's no way I'm going to be supporting you and your husband. Kelly, let's go. He makes it worse. Sorry. Why don't we all just cool off a little bit? Max? Come on, Max. What were you thinking? Mom and Dad set such a good example, you just can't wait to follow in their footsteps, huh? I so don't need this from you right now! The first time we did this, I thought we were going to get run over for sure. Especially when you made me close my eyes. Like I've ever made you do anything. Your lips are cold. Well, so is your nose. Yeah? I thought everyone was going to be happy for us, you know? We did a really great thing, and instead they act like we're... - Mutants? - Yeah. I just wish it could always be like this. Together, the two of us, no... - Noise. - Exactly. You know what? It is like that in all the ways that matter. You've been suspiciously quiet about all this. Well, I guess I don't think it's the end of the world. He's 18, Tim. Life as he knows it, is over. Or it's just beginning. Look, A) Jessica's terrific. And B) sure they're young, but so were we. Makes you more resilient. We were older. Life was different. I don't seem to recall your parents seeing it that way. It was your ponytail they didn't like, not you! Right. I wish I could share your optimism, but I just can't. I will not support their marriage. How you can see this as anything but a disaster? You want my permission. And your blessing. When I was 5, I wanted a doctor's bag. Not a toy, the real thing. And you got it for me. It was black leather. You used to sleep with that doctor's bag, you loved it so much. And when anyone asked you what you wanted to be when you grew up you'd say, "I want to be an orthopedic surgeon." You didn't say, "I want to be a doctor," or "I want to be a surgeon," even. You just said, "I want to be an orthopedic surgeon" like you knew. And that's still what I'm going to be. See, that's the part that I don't get. I'm too young to know that I want to be with Max but I'm not too young to know that I want to be a doctor? Sweetie, you're 17 years old. Yeah, and you always said that Max and I are a better couple than you and Dad ever were. Well, yeah! It's just that you have no idea what kind of obstacles you face. You're just too young, sweetie. I know. I know, and I know that you're worried. Yeah! But you also need to know that this isn't going to ruin my life. It's only going to make it that much more amazing because as great as Max and I are separately, together, we're... together we're just perfect. You know? Promise me you will finish college and get your degree. Of course. And promise me you will use birth control religiously until you get that degree. I swear! And promise me that once you're married... Once I'm married, you can't tell me what to do anymore. I can't? But I'm your mother. Telling you what to do is part of my job description for life. So, where are you guys going to live? Well, we... You haven't thought about it. - No. - No. So you two are perfect together and yet you can't figure out where you're going to sleep? That's OK. You can stay here if you want. Thank you! Thank you! You're welcome. - Thank you! - It's OK. You think Dad's going to come around, right? Who cares what he thinks? Sorry. You do. I know. I... have to stay with your mom. Come on. I'm nervous. Don't be nervous. This is the most beautiful day. You're the most beautiful girl in the world, and I love you... I almost forgot something very important. Jessica! Hey! You came! Don't do this, OK? Your mother only signed that consent form to spite me. Oh, please. You got a new family to take care of. Why don't you just leave these guys alone? You do this and I am done with you. How about I make it easier for you? Jessica! Wait! Yeah, what a threat! Sweetie, come back. Sweetie, today is about you and Max, and how much you two love each other. Nothing and no one else. You understand that? You're right. You're totally right. You are an amazing young woman with a brilliant mind and fantastic instincts. And if you trust your heart, you can't go wrong, OK? Thank you. You just need one thing. Grandma's pearls! She wanted you to have them. They'll be your something old, OK? There we go. And I have something new for you. And blue. Can't forget your something borrowed, which means I want them back. Mom, you didn't have to do all this. You are my first baby, and you're getting married. Of course I had to do it. I wanted to. I love you, sweetie. I love you too, Mom. Thank you. In sickness and in health, as long as you both shall live. I do. Do you have the rings? Then by the power vested in me by the state of Connecticut, I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss the bride. That was fun. Are you serious? OK, open your eyes. Oh my God! It's perfect! Are you kidding me? Hey! Don't worry about it. I already cleared it with Miss Teddy Bear here. She's cool with it. You building a shrine? Hey babe, this place is like a pink palace. Look, you gotta work with me. Yeah, those plastic trophy things, they look good there. I can't wait till we get our own place at Harvard. Be able to decorate it however we want. I won't have to walk by your mom every morning in my underwear. I'm sure she likes it, though. Or we could outlaw underwear altogether. Now you're talkin'! Wait, stop. Just kidding. Hi. What are you doing here? I thought you might want a ride home. Haven't seen you in a couple of weeks. Missed you. Yeah, I miss you too. OK, Mom... You look taller. Max... Look, Max, Jessica's a wonderful girl but sometimes it's... easy to get caught in the moment. What are you saying? I'm saying it's not too late for you to change your mind. Get an annulment. Start fresh. Go to school. We'd even think of getting you a car. You want me to trade Jess in for a car? Max, I... You can keep your ride. You OK, babe? Yeah, just tired. There's nothing you can't tell me, you know. I know. It's like when you fill out forms I'm your "in case of emergency". I get that makes me yours. For the rest of our lives. Hey, what's up? You bailed early. I didn't get in to Harvard. That's not funny. I'm not joking. You got wait listed, right? Rejected. But those other envelopes, they're thick. The closest one is Vermont, 300 miles away. Max, you know that... I let you down. I let us down. We had a plan. And the plan was to be together, OK? And we still will be. We just got to figure out a plan B, that's all. I'm so sorry. Well, you can go to separate schools and see each other on the weekends. Plenty of people have long-distance relationships. It's a good compromise and you can still see each other and not jeopardize your educations. Yeah, and if your love is really strong it'll withstand the distance. Or I could blow off Harvard, get into wherever Max goes, and start in January. You're going to Harvard. This is my screw-up and it's mine to fix. You didn't screw-up anything. You were accepted at 5 very good schools. But my wife will be at Harvard. Look, we had a plan, and I'm not going to make you suffer just because I couldn't hold up my end of the bargain. You're going to Harvard, and I'll figure something out, OK? End of story. That was really intense. Yeah, you're welcome. Hey, I meant before with our Moms. I love that you totally have my back, but you still got to go to school. Don't worry about it. Max, come on. It's important. I'll go, OK? We're only talking like 6 months and I'll be back on track. But what matters right now is that we're together. That's what this is about. The two of us. Our marriage comes first before anything else. Always. Whether your dream is to become a doctor, a lawyer, a... Whether your dream is to become a doctor, a lawyer, a scientist, a rock star, or just to find that perfect person with whom to share your life, making it come true requires the same things: Passion, perseverance, dedication and fearlessness. It is easy for people to tell you what you can't do. The hard part is tuning them out and continuing on with your journey, and say, "You can sit there and wait for us to fail "but we are heading for the stars." We're headed for the stars. We're already gone. One thing I want to say about that speech: it was killer. A perfect mix of pomp, circumstance, and rock n' roll. Cheers to that! Cheers to that. Pretty soon we're all going to be in different places I'm going to UVM, you guys will be in Cambridge, And you're gonna be... - NYU. - Yeah! To getting out of this nowhere town. Yes! Goodbye high school, hello Harvard. Cheers to that! Forget the food pyramid. Ice cream: breakfast of champions. Nice! You're my champion. But not if you take that away! Don't you get enough of me? Of you? Never. You wanna go caffeinate? Excuse me? We're all over-achievers or we wouldn't be here. So instead of wasting the day standing in line, we could go kick it at a cafe and talk to graduates. Sophie. Manhattan shrink spawn. I'm Jessica, Connecticut. Spawn of a plastic surgeon and a former teacher. All your parts look original so either you have huge self-esteem, or your Dad's an incredible plastic surgeon. I have a weakness for arrogant, spoiled Eurotrash. How about you? Smart, athletic, not too cocky. More Gap than Abercrombie. What dorm are you in? Actually, I'm living off-campus. As a freshman! I have the best instincts! All right, fellas! That's lunch! You know what you're doing. The last guy they hired, he thought hammers were for smashing beer cans. You guys, let's not try to kill each other while we're on the clock, all right? How long you been married? Couple of months. You should take your ring off while we're working. It's a good way to lose a finger. You probably think I'm crazy doing it so young. No, my brother got married right out of high school. My sister, she did it in nursing school. Not you? Never found the right girl. Your wife, what does she do? She goes to Harvard. I knew a waitress that hooked up with a Harvard guy. But it doesn't usually work the other way around. I didn't get in, or I'd be there too. Whatever works, man. You catch the Red Sox last night? Heartbreaker. All right, 1958 Pulitzer winner. James... Brown. Come on, seriously. I think James won the Pulitzer. Brown? No? No, it's a four-letter word. Second letter is a "G". A "G". Agee! Good one! At least one of us reads. Hey! OK, should we focus on the global causes of World War One, or the precipitating events? Men are responsible for most of the wars in the world, So it's your call, Carter. Look, I can't focus or defend my gender without pizza. Hey, not to get all Psych 101 here or anything, but you boyfriend seems kind of controlling. He misses me. Max isn't exactly my boyfriend. He's my husband. Are you serious? You don't look... I'm not pregnant, or Mormon, or Orthodox, or even Amish. Max and I just love each other. So, how did your parents feel about it? I knew you were interesting. Was it a total Romeo and Juliet? They're still getting used to it. OK, so, if it's not religion or a medical necessity, then... He's just the one. I think it's romantic as hell. You work too hard, babe. There's just so much more work than in high school, you know? It's hard to keep on top of it. So how was your day? If you got married in February, where did you live? At my Mom's house in my bedroom. Wasn't that weird, though? I mean, you're legally joined, but surrounded by My Little Pony. All that really mattered was that Max and I were together. And I was never into My Little Pony. You make me feel like I'm some sort of science experiment. Sorry, it's just our grandparents were expected to marry super young, not us. So, I'm a non-conformist. Maybe teen marriage is like the new punk rock. I'm wrecked. Me too. So you don't mind if we don't... - No. - Yeah, OK. We had fun though, right? Sure. Family of origin is everything, OK? You can't escape genetics. What about all the people who are adopted and share the same personality traits as the parents who raised them? Luck, or common traits. All nurturing does is bring out what already existed. God, you can't stand to be wrong, can you? Like you wear it so well. True. There's something in your hair. Things got a little messy last night. A bunch of us are going to the pub tonight if you want to come with. Max too. Maybe we'll make an appearance. You want another drink? Yeah, I'm drying out. So, where's the husband? He's just out with some buddies from work. You're very lucky, you know. I'd kill to be in love. He's really... Amazing. You should text Max. Tell him to come by when he's done. You know, you're the real deal. Not really. It's just kind of a side thing. That's only 'cause you want it to be. You're talented! So, what's in these things? Pretty much everything in the bar. You know, it's really weird. I've only known you a few weeks, I don't even know what you drink in your coffee, but it's like... Like we've known each other forever. - Yeah! - Yeah! Cream and two sugars in my coffee. Good to know. Oh here, let me help you with this. There. I'm pretty late. I should probably get home. Oh, here. It's just me and my band. This is pretty cool. Yeah... I need to get home now. It was just a kiss, you know. No, not to me. I'm married, OK? This is a huge mistake. I'm sorry. It can't happen again. Have fun? Yeah. I just wish you had been there. Next time. I gotta go to work. I miss you. I miss you too. Can we go on a date sometime this week? How about tomorrow night? Sounds great. Max is the greatest guy I know. What was I thinking? You weren't thinking. No matter how good your relationship is, there's always going to be temptation. Not helpful. Not finished. You're going to feel all sorts of things for people. Just don't act on it. The trick is to recognize the attraction for what it is and then just walk away. Maybe everyone was right. Maybe we were too young to marry. What if I can't handle this? You can. You love Max and Max loves you. Just focus on that and everything will be fine. Yeah. You're right. OK, bye. You'd really like this Philip Roth novel I'm reading in my lit class. I'll lend it to you when I'm done. I'm kind of into this Michael Connelly. Isn't that kind of lightweight? You grading me on my reading material? I just meant you could use the time to catch up for when you're in school. You know him? Yeah. That's Carter. That his girlfriend? Olivia? No. She's kind of a slut. So, what do you want to do? Whatever. So is this how it's going to be now? We can't hang out? I just don't want it to be weird. No worries. So how long have you been seeing Olivia? It was just dinner and a movie. Going to be seeing her again? Are you asking as my friend, or the girl that kissed me? Carter... I'm just giving you a hard time. Don't sweat it. Hello? Hey. I was pretty surprised that you called. You're my daughter. I don't always agree with your choices, but I do love you, huh? Yeah, I love you too. So, how's married life? Why? Did Mom say something? About what? Nothing. Married life, it's great! And I love school. That's going great too. So, how's Kelly? Baby should be coming any day now, right? Yeah... Kelly and I are on a bit of a sabbatical. I don't believe you. What? What's her name? You know what? Actually, no. Don't tell me. They never last long enough. It's not worth memorizing it, OK? Dad, you don't get it, do you? Marriage, it's about love and loyalty and commitment. It's not about acting on every single impulse that strikes you. God, you are so pathetic! Come on, Jessie. Jessie, come on. He's a complete sociopath. Successful and good-looking on the outside but dead on the inside. Hey, do you feel like we haven't been connecting much lately? I gotta jump, babe. Catch you later. OK, I miss you. I noticed that you're putting tennis courts on the south side of the building, and the pool on the east side. Yeah. You got a problem with that? It's none of my business, but I play tennis, and on an east-west court someone's always got the sun in their eyes. Is that so? Yeah, and if you switch the tennis courts to the east side of the building, they could face north-south and you could have the pool on the south side. Which would be better because... Southern exposure. It's warmer, so the cost to heat the water will be lower. Yes, they would, and I tried to design it that way, but zoning issues made it impossible. What's your name? Max. Max Doyle. You're 21, 22? Eighteen, sir. I got to hand it to you, Max. You got a serious set of cojones. Pretty good instincts too. Max! Max, the lights aren't working! Yeah, I forgot to pay the electric bill. It's kind of cool though! No, it's not cool! My Civ paper is due tomorrow and I'm behind. Well, the electric company was closed before I got back. It doesn't open until 8:00 tomorrow morning. I'm going to be at the library. All unhappy families are unhappy in their own way. Thank you, Mr. Tolstoy. I'm sure that your family's neuroses are just like mine. My parents are still together, actually. Miserable, but very much together. Bad divorce, huh? Let me guess: this is the point during which you tell me that I got married young because I wanted security. I created my own little nuclear family in order to prevent history from repeating itself. Someone's done their homework, I see. Sorry. Hello? This is she. Is he all right? Yeah, I'll be there. Max had an accident at work. See you later. All right, yeah. Is there anyone here for a Max Doyle? Hey. Hi. Just a couple of questions. Is he allergic to penicillin? I don't know. When am I going to be able to see him? He's getting x-rays right now, so it's going to be a while. Looks like he cracked his ribs. Is there any other medication that might have an adverse effect on him? Adverse means negative. I know what it means, I've just never seen him take anything stronger than cold medicine. Stay with me. Should we call his parents then? No, don't do that. What kind of health insurance does he have? I'm not sure. I think it might be with my school plan. He might still be with his parents' plan. I don't know. Why don't you take a seat right there and we'll call you when we're ready, OK? Thank you. Hey, you got a cross today. Sorry, I can't to that today. I thought you were going to stay home and take care of me. I haven't been to school in 3 days. I have mid-terms coming up. I can't blow that off. All right, well, be sure to check your schedule before I get hurt again. Well, if you hadn't been screwing around during your lunch break, maybe this would never have happened. Easy, OK? At the hospital, they asked me about your medical history, and I had to call your mom. So? So, I'm your wife, OK? I should know these things. And now we're stuck with a bill for $1,200 and that was all of our savings. I guess I should've made sure I had health insurance before I took the job. I just figured I was still on my parents' policy. Yeah, OK. I gotta go. Hello. Hey, Nick. How's it going? How's UVM? She's fine. She's busy with school. I'm working. We don't really see each other much, but... It's all good. I thought that the doctor said you should lay low for a little while. I'm going crazy sitting around. I feel fine. Hey, my boss is going to give me an advance to cover the hospital bill. That's pretty great, huh? Yeah, except then you'll be stuck there. Well, what if I wanted to make it more of a permanent gig? I didn't know that you were thinking about that. I like working. It feels good. It's just that whenever we're talking about the future, college was always a part of it. Well, my future isn't mapped out like yours. I don't know what I'm going to be doing for the next 10 years, but I'm pretty sure I don't want to go to college anytime soon. You're serious? Yeah. Is that a problem? All that really matters is that we're together, right? Yeah. Of course. Well, I gotta get to work. So, see you later? I should go home. Some people search their whole lives and never find the right person. You're very lucky. Are you OK? No. When I'm home I wish I was at school. And when I'm at school... You wish you were with him. Not... Not always. I love school so much. It's better than I ever dreamed it would be. All the friends I've made, the things I get to study. And then I go home to Max, and he's working this crummy job, and not going to school, and I feel guilty, you know, because he gave up his entire future for me, and here I am having these doubts. Jess, you guys love each other. You'll work it out. Do you think? You're right. It'll be a lot easier once he's in school and we're on the same page. Yeah. See you later. What's all this? I just thought we could have breakfast together. There you go. They're good. Thanks. So, I have this friend in Bio class who works for admissions and said she could get you an interview for next year. Man, it's just killing you that I'm not in school, isn't it? I think I'm entitled to be just a little bit upset. Because I don't fit in with you and your brilliant new friends? No, it... The guy that I fell in love with he had dreams and a future like mine. We had the same goals, and we wanted the same things. - Jess... - And he trusted me! So... What do you want from me, Jess? Call her? No way, man. She can call me if she's got anything good to say. I went out with a Harvard chick once. She was hot! Smoked these clove cigarettes. It was great when we were alone, but her scene and mine, they don't mix. Man, you should've seen her face when I told her I didn't want to go to college. Might as well have harpooned her. Look, it's none of my business, but if she really loves you she's not going to try to turn you into someone else. So we're at this club, right, and it's a total dive. But it's our first paying gig, so we're really psyched about it. I'm playing keys in this song, and Derek, the lead singer, decides out of the blue that he wants to get his keyboards on. So he shoves me away from the instrument so I go flying off the stage, and I land on my right hand. No way. Turns out I broke two fingers. It was a nightmare. Yeah, I can imagine. I thought you were studying. Hey Max, have a seat, man. What are you doing here? We barely see each other. I looked for you at the library. I thought you could us a break from all your studying. Max, wait! Max, come on! Max! Max! What's your deal? Deal? We've been studying for like, 5 hours and we took a break. It's not a federal crime. Interesting choice of words. Carter and I are just friends. Don't you trust me? You know, I used to, but ever since we came here, you're this totally different person. I could say the exact same thing bout you. Well, you know what? I'm outta here. What's going on? I'm going to stay at Sophie's for a little while. You breaking up with me? We're married, Max. You don't break up. You do a trial separation. Is that what this is? I don't know, OK? Something's changed, and it's major, so... So you're just going to take off? Don't make this more difficult than it has to be. I'm not driving, man. It's 7:30, Max! I miss you. Jessica, I love you, OK? The past two days... I get it. Yeah, I miss you too. Then let me in. You're drunk, babe. Just go home, get some sleep. We'll talk about it tomorrow, OK? OK, or just come right up. Here... Come on... I can't breathe right when you're not around, babe. Come here. What? Go away, Max. Let me in. We can work this out. You've got a hickey the size of New Jersey! You came here straight from some random chick! I can't believe this! No, Jess. Come on... Why don't you work it out with whoever's been gnawing at your neck. 'Cause Max, honestly, I'm done. So please just go. Just go. I can't believe... It's great, you know. I can do whatever I want. I don't need to follow anyone else's schedule. I'll drink to that! Jessica's cool and everything, but by the end, all we did was fight. That sounds just like me and my old girlfriend. I'm sorry. Life's just too short. Another one. I've ignored all his e-mails and texts. I guess he's trying to send something that I can't delete. A for effort. Whose side are you on? At least he's fighting for you. I mean, most guys would just walk away. If you would've seen the size of the hickey on his neck, you wouldn't be defending him. I was ready to go back to him. I'm such an idiot. You kissed Carter. Hey, that was different. If you say so. I'll see you later. I think there's a convenience store just one block up. We can get some ice cream. Ice cream? It's way too cold for ice cream. It's never too cold for ice cream. It's never too early for ice cream. It's never too late... Oh, come on! Hey, it's one of life's simple pleasures. Are we seriously going to fight over ice cream? It's important. OK, OK... Look, I'm willing to be converted. - OK? - OK. Now what kind of ice cream are we going to get? Chocolate. I'm sorry. Yeah, I put it on later, but I got it done when... Didn't waste much time, did you? Look Max, we were just... Don't do this, OK? I'm supposed to pretend this is all OK? You don't take my calls, you don't answer my e-mails... You're still my wife. Have you forgotten that? Oh yeah? You're not exactly by yourself here. Cool down, man... You just stay out of this, OK? Hey. This completely edible senior just invited me to a party tonight, and I have nothing to wear! Sophie, your closet is insane. Yeah, with slutwear, maybe. But I need something more sophisticated. Something that screams, "I did junior year abroad, scandalized Europe, and lived to tell the tale." A little black dress, maybe? I have something that could work but it's at the apartment. Well, I wouldn't make you go all the way over there. You know what? I owe you anyways, so I'll be right back. Hey Max, are you home? I came to get... Looking for the blitz that he knows is coming. 14-13 in the closing minutes of this Thanksgiving Day special. He's through... - How are the ribs? - Fine. I had a talk with Jim Bennett. He's got some time over the weekend if you want to sit down with him. The sooner you and Jessica make a clean break, the sooner you can move on. You mean get a divorce. Honey, you're so young. Maybe you can get an annulment. You've been on this mission against us ever since we got engaged. What's your problem? Max, come on. Well then, back me up, Dad! Part of the reason I wanted to marry Jessica was that you and Mom set such a great example. Yeah, we're 3 years younger than you were, but that's nothing, so why does it bug you so much? Your father and I have had a wonderful marriage and that's exactly what we wanted. Live in a small town, raise a family. But you, you have the potential to become whatever you want. To change the world. I don't want to see anything or anyone get in your way. You see, that's where you got it all wrong. Jessica was my partner, not some kind of obstacle. What? Maybe now he'll go off to college and have a real future. Babe, it's not your life. He's got to make his own mistakes. The kid's had his heart broken. You know, as bad as I feel now I also feel kind of relieved. Those last couple of weeks, all we did was fight. That's how I knew for sure that the relationship was over. Come on, everybody fights. Max and I never used to. That's because you never lived together before. You and Dad, you always fight. Yeah. We still do. The only thing that's changed with the divorce is how we file our tax returns. But if you're happy, you don't fight. Jessica, grow up! Relationships are not black and white. In fact, most of the time, people live in gray. But Mom, these fights, they scared me. You know, I felt like I didn't even know Max anymore. Yeah, but baby, you can't be so rigid. The true test of a marriage is how you get through these bad times. You got to dig in and work through things. And you've got to fight. You've got to fight fair, but you've got to fight. Your father and I didn't fight fair, and we didn't work through things, so we had all of the emotion but none of the compromise. Yeah. I must sound so dumb to you. No. You just sound really young to me. I think I'll head back to Boston early. The air in the house is running kind of thin. I hear you. Why don't you wait until after the party tonight? Is Jessica going to be there? I don't know. Watch this shot. Off the corner, purple in the side. I know I gave you guys a hard time when you were getting married, but you seemed to know what you were doing, so... Well, what's your point? My point is that I've known a lot of cool girls in my life, just none I'd ever take the bullet for. Forget it. I'll pass. Max will be there. So what are you going to do? Hibernate here in Mommy's house while he goes out and has all the fun? Screw that! It'll be too weird. Look, you have just as much right to go to this party as he does. When was the last time you saw him? Last week. I was with Carter and he was with some girl. It was hideous. Don't you think it's a little soon for you to be with some other guy? I'm not with anyone. Come on! It's pathetic. I'm not even 18 and I'm already heading for divorce. Go and speak to him. No way. I can't. Listen, just get it over with. I've been spending a lot of time with the architect on the job site. I might give that a shot. Hey. Hello. Hi. I'm wondering if I'm going to kiss you or kill you. So, what's the verdict? It's good to see you. Yeah, it is. So you didn't tell me about the architect at the site. You never wanted to hear it. Yeah, well, you weren't really interested in hearing about what was going on at school either. I guess I wasn't. Want to go for a walk? Yeah, sure. Schizophrenic much? Geez Holly, you scared the crap out of me! First you go all melodramatic and marry the guy, then you're barely at school a couple of weeks and you kiss someone else? And then you move out 'cause you need your space or whatever... You know, it's not that simple. They always said you were so mature. Jess! Hey! Hey. How was your Thanksgiving? Good, good. How was yours? Long. Couldn't wait to get back. You want to do dinner tonight? I can't. But I'll give you a call. So Jessica and I kind of got together when I went home. For good? I don't know. We're going out tonight. You don't think it's a good idea? None of my business. I'm asking. Just make sure she wants you for who you are, not who she wants you to be. Yeah. Thing is, I kind of like the way she pushes me to think bigger and go for what I want, you know? I need that. What do you think? Depends on your agenda. It's a date. With your estranged husband? God, that sounds sexy! You are so bent. You do realize you barely even took a shower before you went out with Carter? And your point is? True love really does conquer all. I was right. It's just dinner. Besides, for all I know, he's still seeing that girl he went to the movies with. How's school? It's good. Great. It's just really busy. There's a lot of exams, and they're coming up, so... I started filling out applications for the fall. And I'm going to be interning at that architect's office. It's not paid or anything, but it'll be a great experience. That's really fantastic. And I feel like it's something I could do long-term. And I'm not doing it for anyone else. Not my parents or anything. Just for me. I'm really happy for you. It's... Let's get out of here. I missed you so much. I love you, Jess. I guess... I thought if I applied to Harvard again and didn't get in, you wouldn't look at me the same. Max... All your friends are really intense now. You like that. Yeah, I do. But I also like you. Well, that's not exactly true. I love you. I love you too. Well, you know, I never stopped. Even when things got hard. I never thought that we could get so out of sync. And then it felt like we were failing. And I've never felt anything... Babe... It's ironic. For so long, I would slam my dad for leaving us, and then I just went and did the exact same thing. You're not him. But still, we're married. I should've stopped. I should've... Here's the thing: We got to figure these things out one way or another. I'd rather do it with you than without you. Me too. Make-up sex can be pretty persuasive. That is not why I'm going back. I feel solid with Max, in a way that I never have before. He's the only person in the world that I can actually talk to about anything. That I want to talk to, you know? I just kind of lost sight of that. He's my husband. You're so lucky. Yeah, I really am. But yeah, the sex was pretty sensational. I rest my case. So you think you guys will make it? I know I want to and so does he. And I'll never forgive myself if I don't try. Look, I'm probably the biggest sucker for romance you'll ever find, so I'm crossing my fingers for you. But if anything ever changes, my couch is your couch. Thanks. Go home. OK. See, you just don't get me anymore. I'm not into ice cream. Great. More for me. Hey, come on! Am I misunderstanding something? Just that I'm going to kick your butt if you don't give that back, so... OK, wait. What do I get out of it? Compromise is the cornerstone of any good relationship. Well, I think that sharing is the cornerstone of every good relationship. I don't think so.
