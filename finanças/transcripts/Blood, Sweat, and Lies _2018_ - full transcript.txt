My excruciatingly upbeat friend, - Yeah, I saw her, - Yeah, And my stupid ex, - Oh, exes, - Yeah, Okay, so we will definitelybe using this area, - Yes, - Yes, Come on, lot more to see, so follow me, One more, Come on, you got this, You got this, Stay focused, Good, Excellent work, Good job, Thanks, So, how do you feel? - Good, - Good, Good, Yeah, uh, surprised, I didn't expect to be signing up for a gym membership and definitelynot personal training, Well, you will not be disappointed, I promise, Thank you for encouraging me, You're welcome, Tell you what, just sign right there, That's it, Congratulations, Miss Barrett, You are officially a card-carrying gym member, Yay, - There you are, - Oh, hey, - Hi, - Don't gloat, I just signed up for a personal training package, - Nice, - And Trey's my trainer, Very nice, People must tell you all the time that you look familiar, I did a community charity counter last year, So, that's probably it, I'll be googling that later, Uh, tell you what, why don't you come back in tomorrow morning, we'll do all your intro-procedures and stuff, I promise it's not as scary as it sounds, - It was very nice to meet you, - Leslie, Yes, that's right, - Bye, - 'Kay, You are so lucky, I'm just, I'm so proud of you, It's okay, it's a gym membership not a Pulitzer, Yeah, but you did it, and you're doing something, You're creating something, and your new trainer is hot, Don't be weird, Well, not noticing would be weird, Well, it's a professional thing, so, if anything, his vibe will be like a brother, Yeah, an extremely hot brother who's not related to you, Okay, - Mm, - In that case,,, I think you should date him, Do not tempt me, Thank you, Chloe, Excellent, Go ahead and take your break, Do you see anything you like? Absolutely, Yeah, this is,,, It's a nice piece, Yeah, - Antonio Gutierrez, - Hmm, He's young, Totally bizarre, A genius, - It's called "Chrysalis," - Hmm, You can see the rough alternating layers to the paint, coherence, but the texture's a bit of a riot, The artist says he believes in error because beauty is not found,,, Not in perfection, but the artistry of imperfection, You know his work, Yes, The artist graduated from his MFA program a month ago, You just let me babble on like I was introducing him to you, like, you just wandered in off the street, I did just wander in off the street, but yes, I know his work, I was just enjoying watching you do yours, I'm Adam, by the way, Melissa, Well, Melissa, pleasure, Hopefully I'll,,, see you around here again?

Let me, uh, get a quick picture, Sorry, It's a, it's a progress photo, All that before-and-after nonsense, You don't have to do it if you don't want to, - Are you going to post it? - No, No, no, no, I keep 'em in a photo album, in a bin in my desk, No one's ever gonna see them, Okay? - Okay, - Okay, In two seconds, Ready? Great, Easy, Okay, So, uh, let's, let's talk about your fitness goals, You got one? Ever since I was a little girl, I wanted to do,,, a pull-up without any help, - Unassisted? - Yes, but,,, But then where you push yourself all the way up so you're completely upright, Yeah, A muscle-up, It's a very epic move, Only one percent of people are actually capable of doing that move, Oh, wow, - Oh, well, - Okay? A muscle-up, I love it, Okay, so,,, we have the perfect goal, now we need to set the date, I recommend six weeks, It's ambitious, but if you're willing to commit,,, I think we can do it, Six weeks? Okay, Okay, I'm one hundred percent committed, whatever it will take to meet my goal, - Yeah? - Yeah, Excellent, I'm excited, Let's do it, All right, so, the way this works is that you are going to do a pull-up just how you normally would, - Just like normal? - Yes, - Uh-huh, okay, - It's been a while? - Uh, like, ten years, - Ten years, Good, Okay, So, the machine is going to help by supplementing your weight, - It's going to make it easier, - Easier? Yes, Easier? Okay, - Are you ready? - Whoops, - Yeah, - You're good, Let's give it a go, That's all right, - That's supposed to happen, - That's supposed to happen? - Yes, - Okay, All right, now as you pull up, your shoulder blades back, like you're squeezing a tennis ball right there, Do you feel that? - Yeah, - All right, Go, Good, Okay, good, Let's try one more, - All right? - Okay, Good, That's was a great first attempt, all right? You're not gonna be perfect right out of the gate, But eventually,,, I'll get you on that, Are you kidding me? That's a skyscraper, - Yes, it is, - Oh! And believe me, you will do it, All right? Let's try again, - Okay, - Get up there, Okay, Oh! Freeze, I'm Wonder Woman, Good, So, your goal, a muscle-up is basically two parts, First part, the pull-ups we just did, It's your biceps, your lats, your trapezius, everything else, Second part, mainly triceps, which dips are the perfect exercise for that, - Set your water down, - Okay, - And let's go to town, - Okay, Uh,,, There we go, All right, Go for it, Good, Good, Okay, you straighten your arms, shoulders forward, chin down, Good, Can you do one more? - Yes, - Yes, Good, Good, Breathe, Excellent work, my girl, Because you've done such a tremendous job, I got you something, It's a fitness track, - Wow, - Can I have your hand? That's, that's amazing, but I,,, Don't worry, it's covered by the initiation fee, all right? This tracks your calories, it tracks your sleeping pattern, how much you walk, So, that's for you, If you give me your phone, I can set it up for you, That's really nice of you, Thank you so much, You're so welcome, - Wanna do some cardio? - Do I have a choice? - Absolutely not, - Then I'll do it, That's my girl, Hey, Hey, I think I've hit a wall, - Yeah? - Yeah, How far did you run? Uh, maybe ten minutes, Maybe, - Ten minutes? - Maybe, Okay, Here's your phone back, - Thank you, - Welcome, So, let's, uh, get you out of here, Yes, please, Thank you, Hey, - Hey! - Hi! Hey, how's your workout? - It's great, - Leslie, Hi, Trey, So, I scouted out some of the local talent for you, What do you think about that guy? I think his name is Mark, and he's in marketing or something, Oh, Mark in marketing? Or what? Like Trey in training? I think you should ask him out, Um,,, - I am here to work, - That's my girl, Whoo! Good job, killer, - Thank you, - Let's raise it, Give me that, Drink this, - Thank you, - You're welcome, Wait a minute, What's wrong? Is there matcha in this? Yeah, Is that okay? It's perfect, I used to drink these obsessively when I was training in college, - Really? - Yeah, I thought I was the only person who knew about matcha and protein, - It's delicious, right? - Totally, - Mm? - Oh, Takes me back, So good, So, what's the deal with this ex? No offense, but I do not think youare the right confidant for this sort of thing, - Ow, - No, I just,,, I think that you've probably never been dumped, Oh, no, I've, I've been dumped, You want me tell you the first story? Yes, I do, because I do not believe you, Okay, When I was in high school, I had a crush on this girl, um, so I went to pick her up at her house, and when I got there there was a Post-it note on her door that just said "No," Oh-ho, you must have been hideous, Oh-ho-ho! Yeah, laugh it up, - Oh! - I know, Okay, Okay, so, Carter,,, Carter broke up, well,,, the thing about Carter is that I told him that after five years he still didn't know me at-at all, I mean, he did, but he didn't care, I am deathly afraid of heights and,,, he wanted us to go climbing in the Alps, That's bad, What? I don't,,, I have an idea, Oh, what is that? - Are you up for a field trip? - I don't,,, - It's right next door, - I don't trust,,, Say yes, Okay,,, - Let's go, - Okay, Okay, Okay, Now, I was saving this for later in your training, but,,, I think you need it now, It's great for building grip strength, upper body strength and, you know,,, facing your demons, Huh, I don't know if I,,, Listen, you're stronger than you think you are, okay? But we don't have to do this if you're not comfortable, No, I want to, Are you sure? Uh-huh, Okay, Let's do it, You look great, Good, You look great, - I can't do this, - Yes, you can, - I can't, - Yes, you can, I don't want to hear that, You got this, Mel, I will not let you fall, all right? - You wanna reach the top? - Yes, Okay, Climb, Listen to my voice, My voice only, I believe in you, Mel, You got this, I will not let you fall, Okay, okay, Good job, - I can't breathe, - Hey, I can't breathe, Hey! Relax, okay? Take it one handhold at a time, You got this, - Um, have you seen Mel? - Sorry, please hold, She's probably with Trey, They're next door, - At the climbing wall? - Yes, that's right, Oh, Okay, All right, I believe in you, You got this, - I can't,,, - Breathe, You got this, Mel, Okay?

I believe in you! Yes! Whoo! Good job, Mel! You did it! - He could have killed you, - Look, he knew I could do it, I was safe the whole time, Okay, he guessed you could do it, Thanks for the vote of confidence, What, he gambled with your life, I'm sorry, How do you not see how irresponsible that was? You were the one who wanted me to take more risks, Yeah, smart risks, not ridiculous, silly, life-threatening risks, That was not silly! That was important for me, I have been afraid of heights my entire life, and I just did something about it, In the most dangerous way possible, Trey knew I could do it, He believed in me, Why can't you? No one believes in you more than I do, Okay? You're my best friend, I love you, But I just,,, I care about you, And I don't want you to get hurt, okay? I'm sorry I scared you, Sorry, I was kind of a bitch about it, Hello again, - Welcome back, - Thank you, So I've been thinking a lot about the last time I was here, - Oh, - Yeah, I mean, some things are just too beautiful to forget, I'd like to buy it, Chrysalis, Of course, Yes, I'll just look it up, So, it needs to stay on the wall until after the exhibition is over, but I will have it delivered after, Actually, I'd prefer to pick it up, I, uh,,, can't stop thinking about the gallery owner, Well, there is a closing-night party on the 15th, - You're welcome to come, - Um,,, I'd love to, but I think I have a dinner on the 15th, so I'm not sure I'd make it, What time does it end? Ten, That actually works, And when are you free? Uh, how about Saturday? 8:00? All right, It's a date, - Bye, - Bye, Okay,,, Hey, Leslie, Hey, babe, I'm so sorry to bug you, It's not about your hot date, Though I expect details later, Naturally, What's going on?

I'll see you soon, - Okay, bye, - Bye, Okay, if you can pull yourself away from the electronics for a second, we have arrived, Well, to say thank you, I jail-broke your phone and made all the little icons into little flowers, Oh, wow, That's so invasive, Thank you, my little tech friend, You are so welcome, Well, I am so sorry that I made you late, I'm sure Trey will be merciful, All right, see ya, Okay, Bye, - Hey, I am so sorry I'm late, - What happened? Oh, Leslie just needed a ride to work, Something with her car, What? Nothing, Come on, let's get started, No, no, What is it? It's just,,, I've, I've kinda seen this thing before, Now, someone's actually made progress and feel I've been supporting them, they just start to,,, derail them in small ways, I don't know, No, I don't think that's what's happening, No, I'm sure you're right, Here, before we get started, I, uh, I got you a little something, - What is this? - Just open it, It's a key to the gym, Kinda like your home away from home, A lot of clients have 'em, It's kinda like a,,, It's like a rite of passage, That is so cool, - Thank you, - You're welcome, - Ready to get started? - Yeah, - Come on, Let's do it, - Let's go, Did I tell you you look stunning? Yes, you did, But thank you again, So, do you wanna tell me why,,, a great guy like you didn't already have a date on a Saturday night? Well, actually I recently broke up with someone, Yeah, I,,, kind of sworn off dating there for a while,,, till I met you, Do you wanna talk about it? Nothing to talk about really, I felt like she didn't really know me after three years of being together, you know? Mm,,, How 'bout you? Same, But five years, He thought my favorite color was blue, Mm, It's purple, right? Yeah, you've worn a little piece of it with every outfit I've seen you in so far, - Ah, this is it, - Yeah, this is me, - I love it, - Thank you, I do, too, Yeah, I want to see you again, Ditto, Come on, tired girl, What, late night?

How much do you know about modern silver gelatin prints? Well, I could bring you take-out, Well, I can't, Training diet, I can cook for you, Something healthy, I mean, you gotta eat, Okay, I mean, it might be late, Perfect, How'd you learn how to do that? Well, my mother passed away when I was a kid but,,, not before she taught me how to cook, I'm sorry, She must have been very special, Yeah, she was, She,,, really knew her way around the kitchen, and, uh,,, she had your sense of style, What about you? How'd you, uh,,, How'd you get into fine art? Well, I ran track in college so I wanted an easy major, - Art history? - Art history, Yes, Yeah, and then I ended up loving it, So, I was living in Brooklyn after college wearing a lot of black,,, Sexy, And I started working as an assistant in this hole in the wall gallery, I worked my way up to curator, There really wasn't a lot else you could do with an art history degree, I mean, unless you have a lot of money and can become a major collector, which I just didn't, But no offense to you, None taken, Well, the only reason why I have money to collect is because I started collecting, How did you get started? Well, my father was a man who believed in what he could touch, What he could understand, He didn't believe in art or music or any of that nonsense, Hmm, Anyway, when I was nine, I wanted piano lessons, He, uh,,, gave me a subscription of Forbes, Ugh! - Exactly my reaction, - Hmm, So, anyway, when he passed, he left me a little bit of money, Well, I used it to buy an early Buona Sera, My favorite, - Yeah? - Yeah, So, why'd you keep collecting after you made your point? I fell in love, I think our food's gonna get cold, I think I'm okay with that, Ah, Dammit, it's my reminder alarm, I'm late, - Training? - Yeah, Yeah, my trainer is a bit of a stickler, Mm, Well, maybe, I should meet you at the gym sometime for a workout, - Protect you from the stickler, - Oh, I'll hold you to that, Hey, you can hold me anytime, - You like that? - Uh-huh, Good morning, Morning, Mm, I need to go, Yeah, I can't believe you're turning down the possibility of a brunch, You are so strong, I amso strong, - Talk soon? - Oh, yeah, - Make plans? - Absolutely, You're not getting rid of me that easily, Don't get too buff, That's right, You believe in the beauty of imperfection, Mm-hmm, Hey, Melissa, You are perfect, Hey! Trey, You scared me, What are you doing here? You weren't on time, so I figured you might like a nice,,, walk to the gym this morning, - Okay, Sure, - Yeah? Cool, - Let's go, - Yeah, Oh, here, I made that for you, - Thank you, - You're welcome, Hey, Melissa, you forgot your phone, Hey, Adam, this is Trey, Trey, this is Adam, Oh, yeah, Heard so much about you, - Nice to meet you, - About to be mutual, I'm sure, Well, I should get going, Uh, door's locked, - Enjoy your workout, - Thanks, It's nice to meet you, man, Yeah, you too, Take care of her for me, Should we go? Definitely, I'm sorry, I know I keep talking about Adam, All right, you're lagging, hon, Come on, Sorry, You know, it's not just that he's,,, incredibly good-looking or, or that he's well-educated, he's just,,, he's like, he's like nobody I've,,, ever met before, We're gonna pick up the pace, - Okay, Okay, - Come on, come on! There we go, And he, he cooks, He's an amazing cook, I'm, uh,,, Let me get you a bottle of water, Okay, Thank you, I'm just so glad you guys got to meet, Me, too, I'm so,,, I'm so,,, I'm hazy, I'm,,, Mel, Can you hear me? Hey, there she is, Welcome back, beautiful, You wanna sit up? Come on, Slow, slow, Did, did you carry me here? Of course I did, You scared me, passing out like that, Sorry, No, you have nothing to be sorry about, Sometimes you hit,,, a couple of unexpected bumps,,, on the road to success, - Are you okay now? - Yeah, Yeah, I think I'm,,, I'm okay, - I'm good, - Okay, Hey,,, you know I will never let anything happen to you, Never, Right? Okay, Tell you what, why don't you, uh,,, sit here for another minute and,,, I'll get some more ice water in this, All right? I'll be right back, So, you just dropped? Yeah, Well,,, you have been getting a lot of cardio lately, So, tell me about art boy, Well, actually he hasn't really called in a,,, A what? Like, an hour? No, in,,, a while, I mean,,, Ugh, You've always been so clueless about your admirers, - What admirers? - Ugh, In college you had the entire track team on lock-down because of your legs, and then there were the art geeks, and then there was that guy, Who is that guy with the, um,,, hearts? - Th-the hearts guy, - What? The construction paper hearts guy, Come on, He was like, he was like that, that weird, shy guy, big guy, Come on, what was his name? I don't, I don't remember, I don't know, - What? - Mmm, He would leave heart-shaped notes under our dorm room door, like, everyday, I can't believe you don't remember his name, Ugh, I have to go, Mm? What? It's early, Well, I have to go make dinner and catalog the new exhibit which will take hours, mind you, and then,,, I don't know, I have to train in the morning, So,,, yeah, You can stand to miss one day, - What? - Just stop it, I have to train, Oh, my God, You are obsessed with training, Well, maybe you're obsessed with derailing me, What? I'm the one who brought you to the gym in the first place, remember? I do remember, And now I'm getting back in shape, and I'm dating again, and you're over it, Are you serious? I can't believe you would say something like that, Because you don't seem to understand that I have to train, Because your fitness goals are not the gravitational anchor around which my world spins, You know, Trey said you would do this, Oh, what, Trey? Oh, you mean Trey who showed up at your house like a crazy person Trey? Sure, yeah, No, listen to him, not your best friend, Totally cool, - Hey, - Hey! You're here early, I was just finishing up some stuff, Oh, no worries, You mind putting this in the cubby for me? Of course not, I'll be out in a few, - Thanks, - You're welcome, You can do this, Ah! Dammit, Okay, Breathe, Keep your breath normal, Here, let me show you, Step down, Okay, Okay, It's two parts, remember? So imagine you're pulling the bar to you, When you get up, press up, All right? And use your momentum, The view's great up here, You're gonna love it, All truly good things take time, Mel, - You okay? - Mm-hmm, Hey, you'll get there, I promise, Talk to me, Yeah,,, No, it's, it's not just that, I had a fight with Leslie, I basically accused her of sabotaging me, Is she? I don't know, I mean, she's always been there for me, I don't,,, Like when she was there for you with Carter,,, whenthings weren't going well, - Yeah, - Yeah, And now you're kicking ass at the gym, - Now you're seeing this guy, - Adam, Right, Yeah, Adam, And you are strong as hell right now, In my experience, friends want their friends to succeed, they just don't want them to surpass them, My advice is you take a 24-hour detox from Leslie, All right? Just see how you feel, Trust me, Trey, please come to the reception area, Trey, Please be Adam, - Hey, - Hey, - Trey, right? - Yeah, Come on in, Shut the door behind you, Sorry to, uh, walk and talk, but I'm in the middle of a workout, Yeah, No problem, It's pretty early, What brings you by, man? I'm here to see Mel, Is she around? No, This place even open? No, Not for another half hour, Mel has a key though, Oh, well, she said she'd meet me here, Hmm, Maybe she forgot, Yeah, maybe, Her phone doesn't seem to be working, Mm, If you like, I can tell her you stopped by, Yeah, thank you, I'd appreciate that, - Yeah, - Yeah, Well, um, so I'm just gonna head on out, You know what I love about this place? It's science, It's numbers, It's math, Here you dedicate yourself, put your mind to it, you can achieve whatever you want, Doesn't matter what you're born with, Here perfection is a mathematical certainly, Okay, Of course I heard you're more of an art guy, Yeah, I am, You wanna do the superset? Yeah, Why not? No, no, no, Leave it, - I'll spot you, - Yeah, Gonna crack some tunes, man, Okay, take it, Take it, Take it! ♪ If I was a blade I'd shave you smooth ♪ Yo, why didn't you take the bar? Hm? The bar! Sorry, man, Uh, music, I didn't hear you, ♪ If I was a judge I'd break the law ♪ Idiot, ♪ If I was from Paris ♪ ♪ If I was from Paris ♪ ♪ I would say ♪ ♪ Oooh la la la la lala ♪ - You're ready? - Mm-hmm, - Okay, - Yeah, So, what you want to remember is that your attacker will most likely be larger than you, - Okay, - Okay? So, get a good, strong base, - Shoulder-width apart, Good, - Okay, - How's that feel? - Yeah, it feels good, Good, Okay, Now, with my arm I'm gonna reach around right under your throat, okay? Keep your hips back, All right? It's very important to stay as close to your attacker as possible, It minimizes their counter options, all right? Now, with my arm I'll go under your arm, grab the back of your neck and lock out right there, Good, Uh,,, You got a piece of hair, Good, You're doing great, Now, I'll grab the back of your neck, Do you feel that? - Uh-huh, - Okay, Good, With this arm, all right? Will you grab the back of my head? Good, Good, Now the next move,,, is to slowly,,, turn around, Got it, Yeah, I got it, What's going on? Is it Leslie again? No, I took your advice, That's good, Just haven't heard from Adam, I'm sure he'll call, Hey, look, if he doesn't,,, he's crazy, Ready to go again? Actually, do you mind if we just call it a day? No, Of course not, Hey, bro, Yeah, no worries, I can help, Hello? Hello? Mmm, Hello? Who is this? Adam? Hey! We, we don't have a session today, Do you wanna get another work at it? No, I've been thinking about it and I,,, I-I think I need some time away from the gym, Why don't we just do a last weigh in? You know, check your stats, your progress, We'll see where you're at, Five minutes, I promise, - Sure, - Okay, Just give us a little privacy, How was your weekend? It was good, Yeah, - Did you have fun? - Mm-hmm, - Good, - Mm-hmm, Hmm, What's your diet been like? Pretty normal, You gained a pound, Have you been taking the supplements I gave you? Yes, I forgot yesterday, I got busy, Oh, No, no, no, no, Do you know what happens to the body when you ease off, even for a minute? - It's a pound, - It's a shortcoming, I'm gonna go, No, wait, Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, I'm sorry, okay? I believe in you, You are so close to perfect, I just want to help you get there, that's it, I need a break, - Let me out, Trey, - No, I can't let you do that, Okay? Interrupting your progress at this point can be,,, be very dangerous, Get out of my way, Ohh, I need you, And thank you for gettingr the comfort food, 'cause,,, Carter, What are you doing here? Just stopped by to get my last box of stuff, Wow, you, uh,,, You look incredible, Thanks, Why didn't you call? I figured you'd be at work, I went in last night, and I found that someone had broken in and trashed the gallery, so,,, Sorry to hear that, Thanks, Yeah, I filed a police report and an insurance claim, but I can't really do anything until the clean-up crews are gone, Yeah, sure, Yeah, You should probably give me your key, Yeah, yeah, - So, you home alone? - Yes, - Who else would be here? - Oh,,, Your new boyfriend? I know you didn't text me, What are you talking about? Your psychotic new boyfriend, You know, actually, I shouldn't even be talking to you, Who are you talking about? - Adam? - I don't know his name, He said some pretty vile stuff, Like what? Well, aside from jamming body parts into other body parts, to basically stay away from you, What? Oh, look, Mel, I'm happy to see you, and honestly, you look incredible, But tell your demented new boy toy if he texts me again, I'm calling the police, - Carter, w,,, - Hey! - Carter, - Hey, - What is he doing here? - Come in, So Carter said he got some crazy weird text from me, but I didn't send them, I didn't send anything, Mel, you are lucky that I am a technological genius, I am so lucky, I say it every morning like a mantra, Ha-ha, All right, Oh, boy, Yowza! Where is your laptop in this mess? - Keep digging, - Okay, here it is, Okay, Okay,,, So, if someone were sending Carter weird texts,,, I'll find out who, Just let a master work, I also need to remember Carter's number because I blocked it out when he dumped you, Me too, Bingo, Take a look at this, Wow! How'd you do that? That's like magic, Ah, More like advanced computer science, So, yeah, magic, Is it even legal? Oh, geez, Okay, So, what are we looking at? Carter's incoming texts, This is the longest one, Super creepy, and there are tons just like this from the exact same number, Whose? Yours, What the hell, So, who would have access to your phone? I mean, nobody, It's always locked up, - At work, at the gym, - Think, Um,,, - Adam, - Okay, Let's call him, Ah, okay, Well, you call him, because every time I call him, it just cuts off, I mean, I don't know what's up, so,,, - It's blocked, - What? It's blocked, he blocked you, That doesn't make any sense, Look, I'm sure you were amazing in bed, but he definitely blocked you, No, I mean,,, Well, if, if he doesn't want anything to do with me, then,,, Wow, But he,,, W-why would he go through the trouble of texting Carter from my phone? Look, I know you don't like getting any flak for wonder boy at the gym, but,,, he would have access to your phone, Okay, I admit that Trey has been weird lately, actually, very weird, but,,, I mean,,, he changed my life, No, You changed your life, Okay, so let's go check out the gym and do a little reconnaissance, okay? Shoot, I can't, I have that closing exhibit reception at the gallery tonight, I have to go down there and make sure I can even pull it off with all the vandalism, - You're still doing that? - I have to, What am I gonna do, just lose my money on it? Good point, good point, okay, So while you get ready for that, I will see what I can find out at the gym, and then we will meet back up at the gallery party tonight, Okay, Just one thing, What are you writing? Instructions for a backdoor IP assault, There are so many texts, it seems unlikely that this person only texted from your phone, I mean, if they used a computer app to connect at any point, and if they didn't re-route through VPN,,, you can track them, Okay, this is like a foreign language to me, but,,, thanks, Great, Oh, and, uh,,, no, it's not legal, Lunch Tray, Lunch Tray, Have you ever considered exercise? ,,,A whole lot of fat, Damn it, Lunch Tray, man, You sure eat a lot, 1-800-LOSE-WEIGHT, You make a person look like a handicap, Lunch Tray, Lunch Tray, No, Hey, I know you guys are closing really soon, but I wanted to know if I could use your sauna really quick?
