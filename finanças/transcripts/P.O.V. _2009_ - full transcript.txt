Moved to the big city, kinda lost the accent. Yeah, I just [SIGHS], I don't know. I couldn't do a small town for the rest of my life. I needed to see what was out there. So here I am. Um, yeah, people back home, I don't know, I guess I was considered the nice guy. [LAUGHS] I used to have this crush on this girl. Oh, man, blonde hair, blue-eyed. Ah, typical, of course. Yeah, I used to ride my bike up and down her block every single day. I mean [LAUGHS], I don't know what I was thinking. It's not like she was gonna run outside and see me and wanna jump on me and make mad sex, you know? [LAUGHS] Tell everyone at school about it. It's interesting, though. Did I wanna have sex with her or did I want everyone at school to know that I had sex with her? Whoa, this is weird. Wow, I turn the camera on and all of a sudden, the truth comes out [LAUGHS]. Okay [LAUGHS], I'm gonna have to edit this down a little bit. [STATIC HISSING] [OMINOUS MUSIC] I [STATIC HISSING] this way. Record. [STATIC HISSING] Record, you [STATIC HISSING] shit.

Here, get out of my way, I'm trying to... Come on. I'm trying to shoot here. RICK: I could help. Come here, Steve. RICK: Here it is, Stevis Ovarius Rex. Rarely is it ever seen out in the daylight, but luckily, he's chosen a park area where other mates won't see him and rightfully mock him for the poor performance... Hey, give me that! Geez, come on, dude, jerk! [ELECTRONIC WARBLING] Oh [LAUGHS]. Great, great, you probably broke it. RICK: Me, I was the one lunging for it. Aw, fuck. Sorry, but... Don't worry about it.

In fact, I'd go as far as to say that a review of your performance over this past year is not impressive at all. So I'm fired. No, I didn't say that. But you're going to. Your performance was average. We don't fire anyone for average, at least not initially. Look, Steven, I know you wanna be a junior in training, and for now your data entry work is great. It's keeping the company running, but, uh, your behavior at work is a completely different matter. What do you mean? MCGAVIN: People seem to be concerned about your personality. You've had complaints. People just aren't comfortable being around you. [STATIC HISSING] It actually scares them. What? [STATIC HISSING] that. MCGAVIN: You know I can't tell you that. [STATIC HISSING] Aren't comfortable around me. [SIGHS] What's wrong with me? I can't be the worst person in the office, surely. What about Rick? MCGAVIN: No, everybody likes Rick. So you're gonna fire me. No, but this has to change. How do I change it? I don't know, find a way, ask Rick. Okay, thank you, Mr. McGavin. [SIGHS] Busted, shit. Give me my camera, Rick. RICK: [LAUGHS] Hate it when this happens. Don't be an asshole. Hi, Jenna, oof! Give me my camera! [RICK LAUGHS] You are such an asshole. No, people like me [LAUGHS]. You know, I don't, I don't know why I can't find anyone. I always feel like I'm the outsider, you know? Like there's always [SIGHS], everyone else seems to be able to do it just fine, but I've never got it. I don't know how they do it. [SIGHS] I just feel like I'm, like, two degrees off, you know? [SIGHS] I need to find somebody, someone who likes me. Oh, God, I feel sick, this is pathetic. [FAINT ELECTRONIC WHOOSHING] [FAINT POP MUSIC] MAN: Right. Then who invited you? I crashed. What do you do here? Oh, well, um, I'm a lawyer. Well, a junior in training. I do a lot of the after-hours paperwork, but when I'm really lucky, they give me the cases they can't be bothered with, so, come on [LAUGHS]. Nice [LAUGHS]. I'm a junior in training, too. Oh, nice. Yeah, if I stick in there long enough, they might give me my own... [STATIC HISSING] [ELECTRONIC WARBLING] Want a ride? No, no, no, I'm good. You sure? I'm good, yeah, yeah, yeah. Even... Absolutely, okay. Okay, have fun. What are you, what, are you... Uh... What are you doing with that? I am, this is kind of a hobby of mine. I like to document things, especially the beautiful things. [STATIC HISSING] And honestly [LAUGHS], I think that perhaps this might be the beginning of a beautiful relationship [LAUGHS]. I should really be creeped out right now.

You are harmless, aren't you? STEVE: Oh, thanks, thanks a lot. I'm just playing. Oh, you're so pretty. [VANESSA LAUGHS] Can I give you a kiss? Yeah. [STEVE SIGHS] Okay, film me. Really? Why do anything if it's not on camera, right? [STEVE LAUGHS] I mean, alcohol makes me do things I wouldn't normally do. Don't you want to find out what they are? STEVE: Yes, yes, I would. Mom, who's that? Oh. Um... I'm Steve, and you are? Erin. STEVE: Erin, cool. Why do you have a camera? STEVE: I'm making a movie about my life and your mommy's in it. ERIN: Can I be in it?

Interesting, don't you think so, Steve? Just a little. No, actually, I don't. A little... I think you guys are being really weird and stupid. I know, it's true, what are you gonna do about it? Yeah, you gonna actually put down the camera and run after us there? No way. I tell him that all the time and he never really, can't keep up with me ever. He doesn't listen. [VANESSA LAUGHS] He's very competitive. He is. Wow, really. And yet I always seem to beat him. Me, too. Funny that, huh, huh. Interesting, mm-hmm. STEVE: Okay, you guys are being really stupid. You've said. Oh, you know what? What? I think I can take you in a race, ah! Oh, you can't. I can, I can... What, huh, huh? [VANESSA SHOUTING HAPPILY] STEVE: Where are you guys going? Wait, you guys!

I'm my own person. Oh, you know what, just go, just fucking go. My relationship with Vanessa is over. It's dead [LAUGHS DRILY]. You know, I read somewhere that the death of something is the rebirth of something else. You think that's true? [LAUGHS] I don't know whether to believe that or not. I don't really care. [SIGHS] And to be honest, I'm afraid of death. It might seem kinda weird, but [SIGHS], you know, people say that everything comes from your soul. What soul? You live, you die. What else is there? And I remember when I was a little kid I broke my hand. I went to the doctor's office and saw the x-ray. And I saw my bones, just bones, as if from that point on, I just, I realized how fragile life is and how anyone can die at any moment. It's the scariest thing in the world. You can't control it. No one can control it. And I'm scared. I'm truly scared and I don't know, I don't know what to do about that, 'cause I have no control over it. At least I'm scared [LAUGHS], at least I feel something. [FAINT ROCK MUSIC] [PHONE KEYPAD BEEPING] ROBOTIC VOICE: No one is available to answer this call. Please leave a message.

Oh, no, the girl I met in the park. You were too slow doing your shy thing. Whatever, dude. 'Cause that works. Seriously, seriously, as I see it, you have two options. One, the park. For what little I know about Barton, she likes to jog. She is sexy as all hell, and dare I say it, she's actually nice, which means you got a shot, which you better take really fast, because I will run out and tap that ass. This is my one offer, take it or leave it. Or? Or you track down this ex-husband and you wait 'til you got him alone, then you bash his head in with a fuckin' crowbar.

Upload that, post it on your Facebook and Myspace pages... No, no, no, no, no. RICK: And they are fucked. STEVE: Are you crazy? No. Listen, I got some things I need to work out first, okay?

They've got two dead bodies and a stolen car and that's all coincidence, but fucking It's don't matter anymore, man, you know that. The cops were at our door. They're looking for somebody to take the ultimate fall on this, so don't fuck up! I haven't fucked up, I'm innocent! Yeah, you should be acting that way.

[STATIC HISSING] [BARTON GASPING] STEVE: Hey, Barton. [LAUGHS] You must be Steve. STEVE: Yeah, don't worry, I'm a little disappointed, too. Rick told me you'd be shorter. [BARTON LAUGHS DRILY] Oh, no, that was just a joke. You always walk around with a camera? STEVE: Only to document beautiful things. [LAUGHS] Is that your pick-up line? STEVE: Yeah. Didn't work. Uh! Why don't you try calling me next time? STEVEN: Next time? [BARTON LAUGHS] [BIRDS CHIRPING] You bring girls up here a lot? STEVE: Only the ones I find jogging in the park. [LAUGHS] Like me? STEVE: Yeah, like you. [LAUGHS] Come on. STEVE: Whoa, where you going? Come on! STEVE: Hold up. So why didn't it work out with you and Rick? [LAUGHS] Rick is not the relationship type. Told me a few things about you, though. STEVE: Really, like what? That's not for me to say just yet. STEVE: You know, Rick thinks he knows me. He doesn't. Hmm, that's too bad. My friends know me. Come on, give me that. Whoa, whoa, no, no. We're gonna check out this cave. Come on [LAUGHS]. No, no, no. BARTON: Come on, what, you don't wanna be on camera? No [LAUGHS], do you even know how to operate one of those things? BARTON: Oh, [LAUGHS] what, like I'm some kind of idiot? What, smile! [LAUGHS] Come on, tell me something about yourself. Like what? BARTON: I don't know, tell me something, anything. Well, my last girlfriend tried to commit suicide because the person that she was cheating on me with got murdered. BARTON: Are you serious? Yeah, kinda fucks with your head, you know? [STATIC HISSING] Police still haven't [STATIC HISSING] the killer. He's still out there. It's too bad there wasn't a camera around when he needed one, right? [LAUGHS] Steve, I wanna go home. I'm gonna go to the car now. [STATIC HISSING] [WOMAN GASPING] [STATIC DROWNS OUT WOMAN'S VOICE] I need to show you something. I think you're the only person that I can trust with this. You're scaring me. What's going on? Sit down. I haven't shown this to anyone. I found this on Steve's footage. [STATIC HISSING] [WOMAN GASPING] Do you remember Steve's ex-girlfriend Kris? [STATIC HISSING DROWNS OUT WOMAN'S VOICE] [TRAFFIC WHOOSHING] [DISPATCHER SPEAKING FAINTLY] [STATIC HISSING] Come here. Okay. Mm. [BARTON LAUGHS] [CAMERA THUDS] [STATIC HISSING] Mm [LAUGHS]. Mm. Okay, so I met this new girl, Barton. Oh, she is amazing. I [SIGHS], I like her so much. Yeah, I mean, it's really funny, though, you know, 'cause you start to think about, you know, dating someone new and how it's really great and you just have these amazing feelings and, and then you start to think, is it really great? [LAUGHS] I mean, am I just, am I just delusional, because I could swear that I felt the same way with Vanessa. I mean, I felt so good [LAUGHS], and the thanks I got from her was that I'm not good enough. I mean, I saved her life. God, you know, I should've let her die. I should've let her fucking die. I didn't mean that, I didn't mean that. [STATIC HISSING] Oh, shit, did I hit rewind? [STATIC HISSING] [WAVES ROARING] [BIRDS CAWING] You know, these hermit crabs live for about 40 years. They like to travel in pairs. Kinda romantic, huh? STEVE: Yeah, if it's the right pair. How do I look? STEVE: You look hot. [BARTON LAUGHS] You look amazing. [LAUGHS] Come on. [LAUGHS] Hey, where you going? STEVE: Oh, wow. Oh, my God. Hey, beautiful girl right here, remember? STEVE: Yeah, [LAUGHS] yeah, babe, I know. So what are you doing? STEVE: I'm just checking out the view, babe. Just checking out the view [LAUGHS]. Okay. [STATIC HISSING] [PHONE RINGING] STEVE: Oh, shit. Hi, babe. BARTON: Hey, what are you doing? STEVE: Nothing, what are you doing? BARTON: Just looking at you. STEVE: What? Is there something you want to tell me, Steve? STEVE: Babe, wha, babe, babe? Barton, Barton, stop, Barton, stop. Are you following [STATIC HISSING] her? Stop, stop, stop, stop, sh! Are you stalking her? Shut up, shut up. Steve... No, no, sh. Is the camera on? Just keep it down, alright? No. [STATIC HISSING] here? [STATIC HISSING] [ELECTRONIC WARBLING] I, I'm not stalking her [STATIC HISSING], not stalking her, just... Steve, you're sick! Just calm down. You are sick. Okay, you're acting crazy right now, okay? Why are you doing this? No, no. Miss you. I miss you, Steve, she didn't want you. She didn't want you. Shut up, shut... I do! Shut up, okay? Steve [SOBS]. No, no, no, you're overreacting right now. I'm, listen... Just leave me alone. Let's go somewhere else. [STATIC HISSING] Let's go somewhere else. You, I don't wanna talk to you! Let's go somewhere else and talk. I'm sorry, I just feel like that thing is watching me. Let's go somewhere else and talk. Stop it, leave me alone. Come here. Okay, where were we? Steve, you... [STEVE LAUGHS] Barton! Steve, no. Barton! Turn the camera off! Turn it off. STEVE: Just calm down, okay? Everything's gonna be fine. Don't, turn the camera off and leave me alone. I don't wanna talk about it right now. STEVE: Babe, babe, I love you, okay? Let's just go somewhere else and talk about this, all right? It's not a big deal. It's not what it looks like, okay? Why are you following her? STEVE: Babe, I'm not following her. She just happened to be in my shot, okay? She happened to be in your shot all the way across the street sitting down with her friends. Your ex-girlfriend happened to be in your shot? STEVE: Baby, I love you. Trust me, please. You love me. I saw how you were looking at her. You looked at her the same way you look at me, the same way! What, what are you, do you have, like, multiple personalities or [SIGHS]. STEVE: Let's just go, let's just go somewhere else. Leave me alone. Barton! Leave me alone, Steve! Get back... Mm, mm. [LAUGHS] Oh, mm. [MOANING] [BARTON GASPS] No [GASPING]. [STATIC HISSES] [BARTON GASPING] [STATIC HISSING] [ELECTRONIC WARBLING] [STATIC HISSING] [DRAMATIC FANFARE] I gotta check the tapes. Okay, I'll meet her at the coffee shop. When I get back, I'll check the tapes. [STATIC HISSING] [TRAFFIC WHOOSHING] Hi. Hey. Nice bag, new camera? STEVE: No, I didn't think it would be appropriate. I'm impressed. STEVE: So why'd you call? I, um, saw your weblog. My, uh, therapist says that I need to get some closure, that the reason why you carried that camera around all the time was to interfere with intimacy and to distance our relationship from each other. STEVE: Wha, was she, you brought me here because of your therapist? No, wait... I don't need to be here. I wanted to talk to you, not for my therapist but for me. Would you just please sit down? I have some things I need to talk to you about, please. STEVE: You really wanna see me? Yes. [STEVE SIGHS] Look, I care about you. I care about you, I... I care about you, I care about what happens to you. I care about how you feel I treated you, but I don't feel the same way about you, not anymore. I need you to understand that. What, so you have no real feelings for me at all? Real, yes, of course, they're real. But not like before. No, not like before, I can't. It was too difficult, our relationship was hard. It's not supposed to be that hard. You know what, I don't need to be here. Yes, you do. I don't need this shit. We can't end it like this. Can you please listen to me? No! Why can't we end this properly as friends, why does it have to be like this? You saved my life. Where, where are you... Mm. [BOTH MOANING] [VANESSA SHOUTS] Jesus Christ. You fucking bitch. Steven, Steve! Get the fuck over... No, no, no, no! Steve! No, no! Oh, my God, oh... [STATIC HISSING] [WOMAN VOCALIZING] Grab her, oh... [ELECTRONIC WARBLING] [MEN SHOUTING] [FIST THUDS] [MAN SHOUTS] [STATIC HISSING] [VANESSA SCREAMING] [STEVE GRUNTS] [BLOOD SQUELCHES] [STATIC HISSING] [ELECTRONIC WARBLING] [MAN GRUNTING] Mother... No! Huh. Huh. So when were you gonna tell me about your new girlfriend? I was trying, you son of a bitch. I know you saw the tape, Rick. I know you saw everything. You know, there's a reason bodies are piling up around me. [GUN HAMMER CLICKS] And there's a reason you have a gun. Why didn't you stop me while you could, you dumb shit? I already did. I've already posted everything up on the internet. You're done. Well, after I kill you, I'll just take it down. For anybody that's seen it, all I'll be is an urban myth. Come on, Rick, you can't shoot me. You wanna be me. [GUNSHOT BOOMS] [STEVE SHOUTS] Oh, a hurt shoulder? [TRIGGER CLICKS] You son of a bitch! [BOTH SHOUTING] [FIST THUDS] [BOTH GRUNTING] You son of a... [RICK SHOUTS] [STATIC HISSING] Come here, you fucking... [VANESSA WHIMPERING] No, no! Bitch! [CHILD'S VOICE VOCALIZES] Knife! [SOBS] No! No, no it's not [GRUNTS]. [BODIES THUD] [MEN SHOUTING] Motherfucker. Jenna! I will fucking kill you. Jenna! Jenna, help! I will fucking... [STATIC HISSING] Stop. Too fucking slow. [RICK GRUNTING] [KNIFE THUDDING] You getting this? [MAN VOCALIZING] [STEVE GRUNTS] [STATIC HISSING] [MAN GRUNTING] [LAUGHS] Jen, you getting this? [STATIC HISSING] [MAN GRUNTING] [WAVES ROARING] [WOMAN VOCALIZING] [STATIC HISSING] [LAUGHING] Fuck yeah, fuck yeah! [LAUGHS] Oh, yeah. [LAUGHS] Oh, choices, choices, huh, Rick? [LAUGHS] Oh, baby, come here, come here. Are you okay? It's all fun and games. 'Til someone gets hurt. Oh, baby, you still love me? Yeah. Yeah. [ELECTRONIC WARBLING] I love you. Oh, baby, I love you. [MOANING] [STATIC HISSING] [ELECTRONIC WARBLING] You, uh, you take a girl like Jenna, right? Now Jenna falls in love with you, and I mean, she will do almost anything you ask, no matter what, which... Stop, you're hurting me. Fucking wild. [STATIC HISSING] [JENNA GASPING] Come on. You just have to give her a reason. Come on, come on. [JENNA GASPING] [ELECTRONIC WARBLING] So this is my last blog entry. I finally don't feel scared anymore. I keep thinking to myself, is this the future or is it the past? [LAUGHS] Oh, you know, perhaps I don't need this camera anymore. [ELECTRONIC WARBLING] JENNA: Watch your back. I'm smarter than you think, Rick. [STEVE MOANING] [STATIC HISSING] [ELECTRONIC WARBLING] See what I did there? [LAUGHS] Man, it's good to see Jenna again. She was loyal, 'til she wasn't. Then she had to go. Let's rewind back to mother and, uh, you. [OMINOUS MUSIC] Alcohol makes me do things I wouldn't normally do. Don't you wanna find out what they are? STEVE: Yes, yes, I would. Wait for it. Mom, who is that? STEVE: Uh, I'm Steve, and you are? Erin. [LAUGHS] Aw, you were so cute 10 years ago. I called the detectives. No, you didn't. You're right, actually, I text them. I saw you following me and I text them before you grabbed me. You're lying, Erin, just like your mother did. Look at her. She's just like you. I made her immortal. Am I, am I like her? You can't resist, can you? Always have the camera. They know, Steve, they know you kidnapped me! No one knows! [LAUGHS] I just got this camera back, and my tape. It was stolen from me, but it's back where it belongs. I love this part. [VANESSA WHIMPERING] [STEVE GRUNTS] You're sick! [SOBS] STEVE: Smile for the camera, Erin. I don't wanna be on your camera! STEVE: Hmm, let's see. I'm actually filming a movie about my life, and your mom's in it. Can I be in it? STEVE: You already are. VANESSA: Hun, let's get you tucked back into bed. Detectives Baker and Thompson knew you would find me one day, Steve, 10 years or not, and they are going to kill you. No [LAUGHS], no, no. That's where you're wrong. We're all alone, no one's coming. I see you. [HEARTBEAT THUDDING] Like mother, like daughter. Who's the killer, huh, who's the killer? Freeze! [GUNSHOT BOOMS] [ERIN SCREAMS] [GLASS CLATTERS] [GENTLE MUSIC] Wow, I turn the camera on and all of a sudden, the truth comes out [LAUGHS]. Who's the killer, huh, who's the killer? You were. Oh, oh, I've been waiting for a beautiful shot like this. [GENTLE MUSIC] [STATIC HISSING] It's all about how you're remembered, right? [SNIFFS] Right, Rick? [GENTLE MUSIC] [STATIC HISSING] Ah, I love this piece. Makes me think of all the endless possibilities that are out there. [GENTLE MUSIC] [STATIC HISSING] Fucking... [STATIC HISSING] Hey, hey, Jenna, give me the camera! JENNA: [LAUGHS] No, Rick. [OMINOUS MUSIC] [OMINOUS MUSIC] RICK: This is the only time that one can truly be safe from this powerful and deadly creature. [SNICKERS] [OMINOUS MUSIC] Look at you. You know, maybe if you'd put that damn camera down, you could keep up with me. STEVE: Honey, I can't, I'm doing this for our posterity. One day you're gonna look back at this and you're gonna see how beautiful you were and how you could run down the block without losing your breath. You know what, trust me, I never look back. STEVE: Hey, hey, hey, babe... [CAR HORN BLARING] Jesus, what the... Sorry, I didn't see you. I'm, I didn't see you. Oh, God. [OMINOUS MUSIC] [SIGHS] God, I feel sick, this is pathetic. [OMINOUS MUSIC] [STATIC HISSING] It's all fun and games, Steve, until someone gets hurt. [OMINOUS MUSIC] And sir, whoever you are, I'd be careful who you show that tape to. [OMINOUS MUSIC] You know, some of this stuff has been around for years, almost a decade. Who knows where all this stuff came from? This is the stuff nobody wants. [OMINOUS MUSIC] Just give me the camera back. No, no, no, no, no. Just give me it back. RICK: You do not know what's interesting. [STATIC HISSING] [OMINOUS MUSIC] Squiggly lines, sound and color were all confused. You'd start out in black and white. You'd go to color, you'd go back in black and white. You never knew where you were in time. [OMINOUS MUSIC] Take a girl like Jenna, right? Now Jenna falls in love with you, and I mean really in love with you, then she will do almost anything you ask, no matter what, which, pretty fucking wild. [HEARTBEAT THUDDING] Turn the camera off! Turn it off.
