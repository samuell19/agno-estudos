I'm going out. I'll be back before you wake up. Okay? Get lost already! Go! When United Airlines Flight 175 hit the South Tower of the World Trade Center at 09:02 AM, it was clearly not an accident. I'm gonna rip that pussy apart! Yes! I'll destroy it! What are you doing in there? Come out already. You're hard to be found these days. You have to pay me. You know that, right? I know. I just have a few more to do first. - Where is Soghra? - She's in the Square. I'm feeling like shit. I beg you. I'm gonna go to the Square. Keep your eyes open. It's the police, stay down. Wait. Get down, get down. I said, "Wait"! Get your hands off me. - Get your hands off me! - Just wait. Here. - Is that all? - You didn't make me cum. - What the fuck?! - Yeah, you didn't make me cum. - What the fuck is wrong with you?! - Get off! Go! Come. Show me the money first. Cover yourself with this. My neighbors on the lower floors are a bit nosey. No one can see anything in the dark of the night. Just wear it already. Here, this way. What are you waiting for? Come already. Come. Be quiet. Don't make noise. Come already. Hey, listen. I'm not feeling it, to be honest. I'm gonna go now, okay? Come. - No, I have to go. - Just come already! I'll go. I don't want to do it. I have a child. I have no clue what it's about. I have just heard the name Spider Killer. You don't even dare going out of the house after hearing stuff like this. I really don't understand all this violence. Just look around you. There are no clouds in the sky. There's no rain at all. Are you here on a pilgrimage? Yes. Arezoo Rahimi... - From Mashhad? - Yes. Meaning you live here? No, sir. I wouldn't come to a hotel if I lived here. - You want a room for yourself? - Yes. - And you're alone? - Yes, it's just me. Wait a moment. This woman has reserved a room for herself. But she's not married. She's alone. What should I do? Reject her reservation. Sorry, ma'am, apparently there's a problem with our reservation system. I'm sorry, but we can't have any reservations 'cause there are no empty rooms. What do you mean? I said I have a reservation. Yes, I know you have a reservation, but the thing is, I... Apparently you just wanna give me the runaround. I'm a journalist. And here's my press pass. Oh, you're a journalist? Okay, wait a moment. Haji, looks like she's a journalist. - Is it okay now? - Yeah, that's fine. Okay. Welcome, ma'am. - What happened? The problem is fixed now? - Yes, it's fixed now. Out of nowhere? Please cover your hair, ma'am. It's none of your business. Ma'am, they'll shut us down if... You do your job the way you're supposed to, the rest is none of your business. They won't do anything to you, they'll shut our business down. I'm not in the mood to fight with you, just do everything you need to do so I can go up to my room. People are scared. They've become so sensitive about this. They've been after him for 6-7 months now, but they haven't been able to catch him. Look, this guy isn't Einstein. There should be some clues or evidence or something. - Well, he's not an ordinary killer. - How do you know that? - He calls me. - Who? The killer. Are you kidding me? No. He usually calls me after every murder. He calls you? Why does he call you? I have no idea. He must know I'm the editorial director of the criminal section, so he calls me to make sure there'll be news about it. What did he say last time he called? He gave me an address to find the body. And he was angry. He doesn't want to be called a killer. He wants us to call what he's doing "jihad on decadence". How's his tone? Does he sound thrilled? Depends on how he's feeling that day. Some days, he sounds energetic, he acts like he's your friend. You'll even forget why he's calling you. And some days, he's angry. Why haven't you mentioned any of these until now? You shouldn't mention them, either. Please don't write about what I said in your report. Why not? This is not an ordinary murder case. They have told me to ignore religion-related cases. Who told you that? - The order comes from above. - Why, though? This is Mashhad. Some things are done differently here. Sharifi, you didn't use to be such a coward before. I just don't want you to get into trouble. I'm not gonna get into trouble. I'm doing my job. Let me guess, you haven't even recorded any of the calls he's made so far, right? Or have you? Write down what I'm gonna tell you now. - Are you writing it down? - Yes, I am. The Old Road of Quchan, near Shahid Fahmideh Square. Go get the body before it starts to stink. Where are you now? It's none of your business where I am, motherfucker. Listen to me. I'll put down these whores one by one. I won't rest. The cement is ready, boss. Mr. Saeed? The cement is ready. It's ready? 9 BODIES WHO IS THE SPIDER KILLER? Is it your stomach again? Yeah. That's 'cause you're angry or nervous all the time. Saeed... here. Where's Ali? He's in the mosque. Went to say the call to prayer. Saeed, my dad called. He invited us to their house for dinner on Thursday night, but I thought you might be busy. They're not happy at all with how distant you've become, Saeed. They say, "Saeed is never around". And they are right. We're going this time, we'll fix it. - We're going? - Mm-hmm. Okay, good, then. Dad, weren't we supposed to play together? Khadijeh, here. - I'm tired, kiddo. - But you promised. - We'll do it later, okay? - Why not play with her now? Come into my arms. Here. What a lovely girl. People are here in Mashhad on a pilgrimage to meet their beloved Imam Reza and return to where they live after they are emotionally satisfied. Peace be upon you, Imam Reza. Why do you think there's been a peak in murders in the past 2 months? Maybe it's just an accident. Maybe these murders are not connected to each other. But don't they all point to the Spider Killer based on the clues? Looks like you know about this case more than us. So what's your opinion? Are these murders one person's doing or is an organized group behind them? At this point, we think they are done by someone who's smart and prepared. But we can't rule out other scenarios yet. - What are the other scenarios? - Look, Miss Rahimi... it doesn't matter how smart criminals are. They'll make a mistake, eventually. This is the golden rule of criminology. As soon as he makes a mistake, we'll catch him. What if he doesn't make one? It's just a matter of time, but it will happen, eventually. Look, Mr. Rostami, I'm not here to criticize you, but with all these murders piling on one another until now, how is it that you haven't been able to find any clues yet? Where do you think you are right now? This is a police station and I'm the person responsible for this case. Your coverage of this case was subpar from the beginning. You made us look incapable. You think it's easy to do this? If so, then you can come sit here and I'll sit where you are. You can have my rank badges too. - I'm under pressure from Tehran. - Yes, I understand. Everybody's got their own opinion: the Governor, members of the Parliament, the Chief of Police. Do you really think it's easy? Here. Marlboro Red? - So you smoke too? - Just for fun. Everybody's doing it for fun. Is it okay if I take a look at the documents of the case? Look at this. As soon as we soften up a bit, you wanna take advantage of the situation. Not at all. You know I'm not gonna write about the details without your permission. We can talk about that next time we see each other. "Confusion and procrastination from the responsible individuals and the lack of an effective strategy to control the situation has become sort of questionable." I wrote it down. "Meanwhile, there's no sign of an end to these murders in Mashhad." Wrote that down, too. It sounds a bit uncooked, you know? - The ending isn't that good. - Yeah. - We have to make it sound more serious. - What about this? "Meanwhile, the Spider Killer..." Yeah. "Meanwhile, the shadow of the Spider Killer is still looming over Mashhad." "...is still looming over Mashhad." Yeah, this one sounds much better. - Yeah, this one's better. - It's perfect. Come on, Dad, go faster. Faster. Sit tight. This is awesome. Did you like that? If your mom finds out about this, we'll be in trouble. I was so close to falling off. Khin-e Arab Road, between the 10th and 15th kilometer. Okay. I told you not to write all that bullshit. What bullshit? Write that I'm cleaning up the streets for Imam Reza. Enough. Enough already. - No, no, it's not. - What's your name? How long are you gonna keep doing this? However long it's gonna take. Look... I will make sure our martyrs didn't die in vain. - It's people like you that... - Shut your mouth! Haven't they found anything common about these murders? They have. He has a signature for himself. He strangles them with their own scarf and ties the scarf around their necks twice. - All 10 of 'em? - Yes, the coroner said that. Good, at least they talk to you. I called them numerous times. No one gave me an answer. He's a friend of mine. I know him. Why don't these friends of yours ever think about trying DNA tests, examining fingerprints and such? They have done some DNA tests in their labs in Tehran, but, you know, they are still amateur when it comes to technology like that. Also, there has to be a suspect first. They can't just get on with it without having a suspect. Someone has killed 10 women, he's killed them exactly the same way, and he's dropped all the bodies in the same area. All this and they haven't been able to make an arrest? He's one of them. They're looking after him. How does my personal opinion help you and this case? I'm asking because the city is divided right now. Some say these are murders, and some say something else. What are they if not murders? They're saying this person operates according to a fatwa. Of course, Haj Agha, this is not our opinion. I wanna clear that up. I know why you are here. I know why you're wearing that chador... Miss Rahimi. You don't need to pretend. I know you don't like us clerics. You think we're conspiring behind the curtain. You think the regime is corrupt, but it isn't. In the eyes of God, who created the universe, every life is holy. So you don't think these women deserved to die? Why would I? This is a social issue. You won't go and prostitute yourself in the streets if you're not poor and helpless. Looking after the citizens is one of the main foundations of good governance If there was a fatwa in question, which there isn't, it would be just an opinion, not an order. Thank you so much for the explanation, Judge. No problem. I'm sorry, Haj Agha, is it possible for us to have access to the documents of the case? The police also agreed that there needs to be some sort of coverage on this case. Why are you so interested in this case, Miss Rahimi? It's my job, Judge. Your job is to inform the society, not to scare people, not to disturb the public opinion. I gotta say, though, we're not scaring the society. The society is already scared. Miss Rahimi... I'm not gonna let you make this case something it isn't. That's how you operate. You have to be careful how you behave. Especially when you're in the holy city of Mashhad. Thank you, Judge. May God protect you. You know what, I have to talk to these girls myself. One of them must've seen him. Yeah, but talking to those women is difficult. You can't just trust them on a whim. They are drug addicts, they are hammered. 90% of what they say are lies. You know what, if the police were just a bit smarter, they would offer some money to one of those girls to bait him. A cooperation between the police and prostitutes. What an awesome idea you have, Miss Rahimi(!) By the way, Miss Rahimi, what was the story involving you in Tehran? They were saying something about you and that editor-in-chief. They were saying you two were involved with each other or something. "Involved with each other"? The guy would make me wait at the office till the working hours were over for every article I used to write for the newspaper. He'd invite me to his house, to his bedroom. I filed a complaint about him and they fired me instead of him. And you call it "being involved with each other"? I was the victim and you're shaming me. Miss Rahimi, I didn't mean to offend you. Sharifi, you said what you shouldn't have. Miss Rahimi, you know me, come on. Pfft. It's so crowded here today. I wanna go back to the hotel. - I'll escort you. - No need, I can go alone. Come on, you know I wasn't insinuating anything. - Allahu Akbar. - Weren't we supposed to play together? We weren't supposed to play when it's time to say a prayer, though. We were. Look at her, she's interrupting me when I'm saying a prayer now, huh? Don't move, you'll fall off. Don't move, or I'll tickle you. I'm gonna tickle you. This killer has made a lot of noise. How many has he killed so far? They say 10 in the newspaper. The police are after him. They'll catch him, God willing. I've forbidden my daughters from staying out in the evenings. They say he only goes after prostitutes. How can we be sure? Nobody's safe. Some say it's a group, and that they're pros. Yeah, Ali, your father used to run around under a rain of bullets, acting like there isn't a war going on and we're not on the front line or anything. Running around during a war? I haven't lost my mind, Haji. I think you're confusing me with someone else. - I didn't mean to bother you. - You're very welcome. - Are you doing well, God willing? - Yes. Khadijeh, bring that sugar bowl, kiddo. Saeed, you don't visit us in the veterans' association. I'll bring him with me next time, Haji. Here you are. I know you better than my children. There's something going on with you. Or you have a problem you're dealing with. You've become skinny. You're too nervous. Tell me, is there another woman in the picture? - Stop. Stop, Haji. - Huh? - Stop, please. - What? What happened? - I said stop. - Okay. Okay, don't lose your temper. We're chatting with each other. What "chatting" is this that you say stuff like this, Haji? I told Fatemeh, too. He's not like that. He can barely handle one. What's the problem, then? You can at least tell me, huh? What? What's wrong? Nothing, Haji. Work, other problems... I have lost myself. I wanna do something... You know, I don't think I'm made to do masonry, construction, renovation and things of that nature. Haji, Haji... I wish the war wasn't over, Haji.. Some became martyrs, some became MIA, some lost a body part, some returned to their families in coffins. But I didn't become anything. Why? 'Cause I didn't deserve it? Why didn't I deserve it? Not everyone's supposed to become a martyr. It's not up to us. Only God has a say in that. Now, we just have to live our lives, take care of our families. They are not at fault here. How about this? Drop me off at my house, then take the car and go somewhere for the holidays with your family. Okay? Sir, can I use the bathroom? It's for the customers. Please. Bring a bottle of orange Fanta too. Ma'am, are you okay? Want me to buy you a sandwich too? It's okay if you do. What's your name? Soghra. Aren't you afraid of hanging around here at this hour? Afraid of what? This killer who murders women. Haven't you or your friends seen him around here? Haven't you seen anyone who's even remotely suspicious? Everyone's suspicious here. Do you use? Do you do drugs or something? Do you stand near this hotel every night? - Thank you. - Soghra... Get lost! Get lost! I said, "Get lost"! Yeah, come on. Come on, this is a goal. This is a goal, no? One doesn't dribble their dad. Throw it. Come on. Go. Go, kiddo. Go forward. We need to do this more often. - We will. - The kids like it so much. I want nothing but peace for you guys. - I know that. - You do? Why are you laughing then? 'Cause you say that, but you... I'm sorry, Dad. Come here, kiddo. Come here. - I'm sorry, Dad... - Come here! - Dad? - Saeed? Where are you going? Come here! Come here, kiddo! - Dad... - Saeed! - Stop. I said stop. - Dad! What happened? What are you doing? Sit. Ali, look what you've done. What happened, Saeed? What's wrong, Saeed? Look at me. What's happening to you? What's going on? I'm sorry, Dad. Come on, it's not good to let everybody see you like this. Come on. Ali, you too, let's go and sit with your sisters. You're always busy at work, and the one day we're going out, you start acting like this. It's nothing, kiddo. - Ah, damn it! - What? I forgot to take the tools to Gholam. - So? - He's gotta start at dawn. So what? You need to take them to him right now? Yeah, if I take them to him right now, I'll be sure, Fatemeh. - Can't you go some other time? - No. Say sorry to your father on my behalf. I'll come after you tomorrow after lunch. - "Tomorrow after lunch"? - Yeah. Okay? Get off, kids. Fatemeh... Dear Fatemeh, dear Fatemeh... look at me. Come on, get off. Why are you so upset? I said I'd come after you. Why are you so shy? Can I eat an apple? Of course. Take one. Make yourself at home. Are you okay? Are you sick? It's so hot in here. I'll open the window. Glory be to God. Fatemeh? Fatemeh? Can you take those trash bags out? Yeah, I can. Why are you back so soon? I forgot the pickles I was supposed to give my mom. They're craving them. Where are the kids? At their house. What happened here? Nothing. The pipe is leaking. I have to call Mr. Ahmad to come and fix it. Again? Didn't he come and fix it just before Nowruz? No idea... Why have you rolled the carpet like this? It's gonna get bulges. I'll fix it, my dear. Just, if you can, warm up some food please. - Haven't you had anything yet? - No, I'm so hungry. You understood me, and as always, helped me make my dreams come true. I know all about your dreams. You didn't notice anything? Notice what? Look here. I made my hair curly. See the curls around here? I went to a hair salon with my mom today. Was it expensive? - It's beautiful. - Yeah, right. If I hadn't said anything, you'd never notice it. My dear... - Saeed? - Yeah? Do you remember the night before Ashura that I went to my parents' house with the kids? Yeah? I don't know, Mrs. Marzieh said he saw you that night coming home with a woman. Mrs. Marzieh confused me with someone else. How is it possible for her to confuse you with someone else from a 10-meter distance, Saeed? Dear Fatemeh, you know me. There's no other woman in the picture. Saeed? Saeed, are you tired of me? Tired of you? - Mr. Sharifi... - Hi. - I see you've brought your guest with you. - Yes. You can't possibly complain about your level of access anymore, Miss Rahimi. You can go and take a look What are you trying so hard to look at here? What are you doing? You're stepping over the tomatoes. Officer Sheidaei, let her pass. Keep your distance from the body. Keep away. This is a crime scene you're trying to enter. Keep away. Ma'am, I'm talking to you, keep your distance. Miss Rahimi? Try to breathe. Keep your distance from the body. Keep your distance already! Why has this son a bitch dropped the body in the middle of my farm? No one's gonna buy my tomatoes now. Make way. Go stand there. Folks, don't stand here. Make way. Officer Mohammadi, give Miss Rahimi some sweet tea. Try to breathe. Thank you. Miss Rahimi, drop this case. It's like a black hole. There's no end to it. Think of your own health and safety. Bye. - Hello. - Hello. I thought I'd come and check on you. Are you feeling better? I'm good, thank you. I needed to talk to you about something. Can I come in? Are you feeling comfortable here? - It's okay. - For a short period of time, yeah. Sit. Thank you, I'm fine like this. Join me. Thank you for letting me come to the crime scene. I told Mr. Sharifi that crime scenes are not a good place for women to be at. I was a bit shocked 'cause I had seen that girl somewhere before. They're all alike. Addicted to drugs and prostitution. This one was also pregnant. She had a bump on her belly. It's really disgusting... to sleep around with a baby in your belly. Anyway, I didn't come here to talk about work. Sorry, but I'm a bit tired, so... if you don't have anything else to talk about, please... Don't judge me based on my uniform. Unfortunately, I look serious, but, deep down, I'm an emotional person. I wanna show you around Mashhad, take you to dinner at Shandiz Restaurant. Mr. Rostami, I told you I'm tired and I wanna get some rest, and you can go leave right now. Go on. I said go. What if I don't want to? What're you gonna do? Call the police? Guess they fired you from your job at that newspaper 'cause you were trying to seduce men like this. You're not worth it. You're one of those women who would smoke with any man. You're one of those. Yeah. - Dad, look what I found. - What did you find, kiddo? Let me see. This is trash. Why did you throw it out the window, Dad? Why didn't you throw it into the trash can? You're right, I should've thrown it into the trash can, but, well... it was fun to do it this way, too. Like other kids who do things like that... Mom, look what Dad did, he threw the apple out the window. Why did you throw the apple out the window? Good things you're teaching your children(!) Come, kiddo. The cab will be here shortly, are you ready? Yeah, I'm ready. I wanna throw an apple out the window too... No. Dad was wrong to throw that apple out the window. You shouldn't follow in his footsteps, okay? Good girl. Let's go. Grandma and Grandpa are waiting for us. It must be near here. Are you sure about this? This is not a good neighborhood. I'll call you. Young man... - hello. You good? - Hello. - Do you know a Ms. Zari? - Yeah, she lives there. Hello. - Are you Ms. Zari? - What do you want? I wanted to talk to you for a few minutes about Soghra. - Who's Soghra? - Your daughter. I don't know any Soghra. Leave. Go. Why are you being nosey? What do you want from me? I don't know any Soghra. Leave! Go! Which Soghra do you wanna talk about? Which Soghra do you wanna talk about, huh? Which Soghra? Which Soghra do you wanna talk about? Which Soghra? It was him who picked up Somayeh, too. I know for a fact that it was him. Mr. Rasoul had seen her with him on the back of his motorcycle. Who's Mr. Rasoul? He's a municipal worker. He works in the Square near here. - Has he seen his face? - From a distance. But I don't know about Soghra. I had told her not go with men on motorcycles. She used to listen to me. Where was Soghra standing that night? As always. Somewhere around Laleh Square. Have you told all this to the police too? Take a look at me, princess. I do 6 grams of Afghani opium per day. You expect me to go and talk to the police like this? What if we go together? I'll vouch for you. Have you lost your fuckin' mind? The guy is cleaning up the streets for them. You think they'll actually try to catch him? I saw him, like, 4-5 times. He used to come here with his motorcycle, look around and check out everywhere around here. Where did he pick up Somayeh? There. Across the street. Did Soghra go with him, too? Are you with the police? No, I already told you, I'm writing an article for a newspaper. I have butted heads with the police a lot. I wanna spend what's remaining of my life in peace. Yeah, apparently he comes around here on Thursdays, according to him. He, also, said that his face looks like a religious type of person. It all adds up if we consider everything you said too. Okay, you just be careful and don't do anything else. Are you there now? Yeah. Look, Khin-e Arab Road is just across the highway. It'd be a piece of cake to drop a body there. I'd even wonder if he lives around here. No, I don't think so. Let me call Rostami... No, I don't trust the police. What do you mean? That's the way to go in situations like this. - No, I told you. I don't trust them. - Why not? There are many reasons. I can barely trust you. Thanks for the vote of confidence(!) What you wanna do is a stupid idea. Okay, yeah, it's an stupid idea and I'm stupid. Now, do you wanna help or not? What are these things you're saying today? Are you coming or not? I told you, you've become such a coward. Wanna go for a ride? A ride? On your donkey? Get lost. I saw you two nights ago. Kismet wants us to spend some time together tonight. No, kismet wants you to jack yourself off tonight. I got a good place, good food and there's also opium. Let me see your money. Sit tight. How long are you gonna be in there? - However long my pussy wants. - Come out already. Look, she doesn't like to be yelled at. Cover yourself. - Ow. I like you! - Get your hands off me. Don't do it. Don't you wanna start? You time is being counted. Let me see if you can take care of my pussy or not. Where's your opium? Or did you lie about it? No. What? I'm preparing it, wait. I'm coming, wait. Oh, you like it rough, huh? I love that beard of yours... Fuckin' whore! - Keep your hands off me. Don't. - What happened? I have to use the bathroom. Go then. It's your turn to sing in there now. Help me, God. Come on out! Where are you? Come into my arms, come on. Motherfucker. What? Why aren't you laughing? Laugh. Laugh. Laugh. - Come. - Shut up! Get lost, asshole! - Miss Rahimi. - Don't come close. Let's leave. It's getting late. We can't go and... wait there every night. He won't come. He will. I know he will. Where can I find the newspapers writing about this Spider Killer? No idea, sir. Maybe take a look at those? - Here. - Hi, dear Fatemeh. You good? You arrived at the perfect time. - My mother-in-law likes me, that's why. - Clearly, she does. I do like you, Saeed. That's why I cooked your favorite, celery and beef stew. Khadijeh, Zahra, come. It's dinner time. Zahra, come. We're having dinner. It's gonna get cold. Everyday, when we wanna have a meal, there should be Shirazi salad with the food, otherwise, it's not gonna be a real meal. Thank you. What's happened to your hand, Saeed? I didn't even notice it. What's happened? There was an accident today when we were working with a pickaxe. I didn't notice it at first, either. How bad is it? What were you doing? We were knocking down a brick wall with a pickaxe. The guys weren't paying attention, but it was partly my mistake, too. You're not 100% there, these days. Hopefully, it'll get better soon. Go on with the dinner, please. It'll get cold. Want me to serve you some? What should I say, kiddo? Whenever you're going somewhere, you just call us from the destination every time, but that's not enough. - Dear Arezoo... - I'm sorry, Mom, I was very busy. My child, think of your father a bit, too. He's got diabetes. What difference would my call make to Dad's diabetes? It's okay. Laugh it off. Some day, you'll have children of your own and you'll understand how this works. By the way, did you get your eyebrows done, Mom? Arezoo, are you smoking? Make sure they're not too thick this time. They looked like an airport runway last time. Don't change the subject. You have asthma. Smoking is not good for you. Tell me, are you still looking for that killer? Yeah, I am. Do you ever think about how worried we get about you? Don't be worried, Mom. It isn't the first time I'm doing this. I'm careful. Pfft. You always say that. Fuckin' whore! Come, get on. Get lost. What are you waiting for? Come on. - You got any money? - I do. Get on. Sit tight. Fuckin' asshole! Where the hell did he go? Motherfucker! In here. One would never know who might knock on the door at an inconvenient time. Go sit. Make yourself at home. - There? - Anywhere you feel comfortable. In the dark? You're right. Can't sit in the dark. Here, there the lights are. Go sit and be comfortable. Tea or fruits? Which one will you have? Tea or fruits? Where's the bathroom? It's here to the right. What's your name? Zahra. - Are you from Mashhad? - Yeah. - Where in Mashhad? - None of your business. You're lying, right? You're not from Mashhad. What's your job? Do I ask you about your job? I'm a mason. Is this your first time? You look amateur. - What's happened to your hand? - Nothing. Accident at work. - What are you doing? - Nothing, I'm just playing. - What are you doing? Get off me! - I'm playi... Calm down. Calm down. - I'm not alone here. - I was just playing and joking around. - Go open the door! - Okay, calm down. - I said go open the door! Go! - Okay. Okay. - Come on! - Okay. - Faster! - Okay. Okay. Calm down. Calm down. Calm down. - Step aside. Step aside! - Okay, here. - Help! - You fuckin' whore... You piece of garbage! You pull a knife on me, huh?! - Huh? - Get off m... - You pull a knife on me, you fuckin' slut? - Help! Wait, where are you going? If you come close, I'll stab you. Don't scream. - Help! - Don't scream. Don't scream! - Help, people! - Don't scream! - Stay back, I said. - I beg you, don't scream. Don't scream. I have a family. I beg you, don't scream. - Go to the bathroom and lock yourself in. - Okay, okay. Just don't scream. I beg you. - Stay back. - Don't scream. Okay, okay. I will. - Go to the bathroom and lock yourself in! - Okay, okay. I will. Okay, okay. Come on, or I'll scream louder! Don't scream! Lock the door! Help! - Mr. Saeed? - What's with all the noise? Answer the door, Saeed. Yes? I'm coming. Who was it? It's the police, they have some questions. - The police? Why are they here? - Yeah. Maybe Ali has done something. I knew he'd get into trouble one day playing football... Wait, I'm coming too. No, there's no need. I'll be right back. - Yes? - Mr. Azimi? - Yes, it's me. - Saeed Azimi? - Yes. - Is this your house? Yes, it is. You have to come with us to the police station. What are you looking at? I'm talking to you. I know why you're here. Okay, then you're coming with us willingly. Just let me change out of my pyjamas first. No need for that. We're going right now. Take it easy. My neighbors are looking at us. What's going on, Dad? Nothing, kiddo. Go inside, I'll be back in a couple of hours. Where are you taking him? What's happened? Saeed? Saeed?! Where are you taking him?! Dad! I thank our hardworking brothers in the police department who were able to arrest this criminal after all the work they've put in round the clock, and show that... Look how grateful they are of you(!) They're constantly mentioning your help and thanking you for what you did(!) You've become famous(!) It's not over yet. I wanna thank the press for their presence here. There's no way they're gonna let him get away. He's got a thick case. They'll try and find a way. We will make sure those who try to jeopardize the safety of the holy city of Mashhad, will get their deserved punishment. Do you still think there's a conspiracy here? How was he? He was fine. He'll be back in a few days. Who did he get in a fight with? He didn't get in a fight, dear. How do I explain it to you? Your dad has sent some of these depraved women in the streets to hell. Ali, dear, you don't need to think about this stuff. God will help us. - So they'll release him? - Of course they will. Why not, dear? Your dad hasn't done anything wrong. What were these women doing? God, forgive me. Ali, dear, those women were depraved, morally corrupt and worthless. They would find young people in the streets and sell them drugs. They got what they deserved. Your father isn't the one at fault here. Ma'am, tell Mr. Abbas I said hi. Thank you for shopping here. - How much will this cost? - Nothing, Ali. Be my guest. Thanks. How much? Why are you upset, man? Is your Dad well? Thanks for asking. Yeah, he's fine. Still in prison. You shouldn't feel embarrassed, Ali. Tell your mom I said hi. And that she can come anytime and take whatever you guys need. Thanks. Some fruit... is nothing to me to charge you for. We owe your dad a lot more than that. Take it, go tell your mom I said hi, and that she can come anytime and take whatever you guys need. - Thank you. - No worries, don't forget what I told you. - Bye. - Bye. I was feeling responsible for cleaning up the city and ridding it of sin and decadence. How did you know the victims were morally corrupt? It was obvious, Judge. How did you know for sure? Well, you don't really need to be a genius to identify whores in the streets. Watch your tone, Mr. Azimi. The court is considered holy. Never use obscene words like that again here. "Obscene" is how those women stand in front of Imam Reza's holy shrine and offer their bodies in safety. So you're confirming that you committed murder in all 17 counts? 16, Judge. So who's killed the 17th victim? A coward. If he wasn't a coward, he'd come out and own up to it. Silence! Silence! Where were you when your wife was killed? In prison, Judge. What was the crime? Distribution of drugs. Some people came here and tried to convince us of forgiving him. They tried everything. They even offered us money. But you're not gonna forgive him? We won't forgive a killer. Why didn't you come to the court session? We wanted to come, but... We don't want to drag this on for too long, you understand? But you're her parents. You can file a civil lawsuit. So what? So what? You want us to go to court, stand in front of all those people so that they can tell us our daughter was morally corrupt? That she was doing opium? Sorry, ma'am. We know this isn't a good time. To be honest... I'm glad she died. I got rid of all the trouble she'd bring with her. The path she chose for her life... wouldn't lead to a better ending, I'm glad she died. Stop it, woman. It's not a good look. It's not good to say things like that when the kid's around. She'll hear. So what? Am I wrong? I'm not wrong. No, I'm not wrong. Sorry about that. She can't control her emotions. She's always crying. If you're given the choice, do you prefer retaliation in kind or financial compensation? She won't come back to life by executing her killer. No. And after that, it's just gonna be me who can't work anymore, and that poor little girl who'd need to work her ass off for a bite. I'm just worried about her kid, I don't want her to end up like her mom. She was the apple of my eye. I raised her the best I could. Did you see that? That's what I was talking about. They're trying to buy him forgiveness. These people are all poor and helpless. They're gonna sign all sorts of documents for some money in return. Do you still think I'm paranoid? Where do you think the money comes from? What's gonna be the result of this session, now, Mr. Lawyer? Look, Mrs. Azimi, this case has turned into sort of a political matter. The government is pressuring everyone to close this case before the election. They're moving forward with it very quickly. But it can't go on like this. Saeed is currently being supported by the society. He has friends out there. People like him and support him in the streets. Exactly. My father has a lot of supporters. Yes, and that's why the mental illness defense is on the table. - And it's his only chance. - What does "mental illness defense" mean? It means we'll prove that Saeed wasn't 100% there when he was committing the crimes. My father is not crazy, Mr. Lawyer. Shut your mouth. Either stay silent or get out. Haji, it's so kind of you, but these are a lot. It's nothing, Mrs. Fatemeh. Members of the association have gathered these to help you out a bit. May God reward them. God willing... everything will be fine. How are you doing these days? I don't know what to say, Haji. It wouldn't even cross my mind that Saeed would do something like that. Why would he try to be a hero? Don't worry about it. We're gathering signatures to support him. Ali, wait. Wait, I'm coming, too. People don't want him to be convicted. But, Haji, this... judge doesn't seem to care about any of that. A judge can't rule against people's will. You're right, but apparently Saeed's case is different, it's become political, Haji. You don't need to worry about things like that. That's why we're here. His friends are by his side. I don't know, Haji... You just take care of your children. Ali... look after the family. - Okay. - Okay? - Look after your mother and sisters. - Will do. Between the years 1981 and 1988, he'd been active for 623 days on the front line of war. There's no doubt that the war has created some serious mental issues for him. The defendant has had a history of mental illness from a long time ago. The question is whether or not the defendant himself believes in it. His medical history leaves no doubt. Nevertheless, the court will this into account. - Thank you. - I told you they'd find a way. The defendant can take the stand and give an explanation on his mental illness now, if any. In the name of the martyrs. Judge, if the documents say I'm crazy... then there's nothing left to say. Yes, I'm crazy. Crazy about the 8th Imam. - Mr. Azimi... Mr. Azimi... - Imam Reza. Crazy about getting rid of decadence. Mr. Azimi, the court is not a place for your personal opinion and values. Am I crazy, in your opinion? Saeed... Do you think I'm crazy? Either answer the questions, or I'll give the order to remove you. - Mom, Mom, Mom! - If doing your duty means you're crazy... - Go on. Remove him from the court. - then, yes, I'm crazy, Judge. - Get out. - I'm crazy about Imam Reza. I'm crazy about ridding the world of decadence. - Get out. Go on, escort him out. - What's wrong with this kind of craziness? Yes, I am crazy. Crazy about God. I'm crazy about God. Mr. Saeed, God be with you. I'm at your service. I thought we agreed on that. We talked a lot about it, your lawyer talked to you about it. Then you take the stand in court and say something else? Don't say things like that, Fatemeh. I'm not crazy. Am I? Huh? Do you think I'm crazy? Plus, I don't want my supporters to think they're supporting a crazy person. Who's supporting you? People in the streets, everyone here in prison, they all... Stop it! Stop, I can't listen to another word. Listen to me... Look at me. Look at me. I'll be out very soon. Okay? You say things like that a lot, Saeed. I said I'll be out very soon. Now, go be with the kids. Send Ali inside, I wanna talk to him. What's going on? Why are you so nervous? Why are you putting your finger in your nose? Who taught you to do things like that? Why are you smiling? - You did. - I did? Okay. How's school going? - I'm not going to school. - You're not? Why? I got in a fight. Why? The boy I got in a fight with said, "Your father is a killer". Everybody's got their own opinion and way of thinking, nothing wrong with that. Most people like you, I know that. I didn't do anything, kiddo. And if I have, it's been for God. I have a clear conscience. How were you taking care those women? It's not appropriate for kids, dear. You just said I've become a man! I said something and you believed it? How were you taking care of them? I used to pick them up in the streets, bring them home, then I'd make them drop on the floor, and I'd strangle them with my hands. Wouldn't they try to escape? Of course they would. For sure. But you wouldn't underestimate your father, would you? Thank you very much for your time, Mrs. Azimi. We know this situation hasn't been kind to you, either. No problem. Please go on. How were you feeling when you were told the Spider Killer is your husband? I was feeling very bad. I was shocked. I didn't think Saeed would be the kind of person to do things like that. Did you notice anything different about his behavior - during the past year? - No, nothing. He was the same person. He wasn't different at all. He used to leave for work and come back warmly to his family at the end of the day. He never acted in a way I'd become suspicious that something's happened to him. What I think is that, if these women had morals and weren't in the streets hunting for other women's husbands... I was one of those women. He took me to your house, too. But you weren't part of the law enforcement to act as bait in the streets, so that my husband would come after you and do his moral duty. What about your husband? Was he part of the law enforcement and tasked with cleaning up the city? My husband was on the front line of war. He's from a family with martyrs. When he sees all these women are wearing a high low outdoor robe putting on make-up and chewing a gum in this holy city... I'm sorry to go on a rant like this, you're like my own brother... - That's not the point here, Mrs. Azimi... - Do think that's normal? Mrs. Azimi, can we talk to Ali about this, too? Yes, you can. Ali loves his father. I'll tell him to come here. Ali. According to the defendant's crystal clear confession and explanation, his reconstruction of the crime scenes, and the statement from Miss Arezoo Rahimi, a witness in this case, and in accordance with articles 286, 383, 621 and 618 of the Islamic Penal Code, I hereby request the maximum possible punishment for the defendant from the court. The defendant can take the stand for his final defense statement. In the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. "To firmly establish the truth "and wipe out falsehood, "even to the dismay of the wicked." I read the Persian translation, too, so everyone can understand, Judge. Saeed Azimi is innocent! Go away, please. Don't gather up there. Are you seeing the crowd? I do. They'll be back to their livelihood in a few days. And it'll be just us vs our problems. Saeed Azimi must be released! Sit there, Mr. Azimi. Thank you, brother. Well, well, Miss Rahimi, you were able to seduce me perfectly that night with your make-up. This is Mr. Sharifi, from Khorasan Newspaper. So you're Mr. Sharifi? I've heard your voice numerous times. What a friendly gathering(!) Mr. Azimi, have you ever felt guilty? Why would I? I did my duty. If I ever feel guilty... it'll be 'cause I failed to finish my work. So 16 weren't enough for you? Almost 17... I had identified about 200 of those women around the holy shrine to take care of during various hours. Lately, if I wasn't killing anyone, I wouldn't be able to sleep at night, like drug addicts. So you were never feeling anything when you were killing these women? No. So you weren't enjoying the fact that you were gonna kill me? You didn't enjoy every time you killed one of those women? What I enjoyed the most was the fact that I was cleaning up the city. My joy wasn't personal. You can't possibly say that to me. I was there that night. But you got lucky that you could escape that night. Otherwise, you'd be stinking right now on Khin-e Arab Road. Watch your tone. Don't be afraid, Miss Rahimi. We're just talking. Tomorrow is the last session of the court. It's gonna come to an end. Tomorrow, you're gonna be witnesses too. Witnesses to miracles. My work is not finished yet. Be sure of that. Looks like you're sure you'll get away. You can hear it right now. People are by my side. It's people's will, too. I have a lot of unfinished work to complete, not just in Mashhad, but in the entire country. The defendant may rise. The 53rd Branch of Mashhad's Public Court hereby declares the defendant, Saeed Azimi, son of Mohammad, born on September 4th, 1955, guilty in the case of 16 counts of first-degree murder, kidnapping, as well as disturbing the public opinion and threatening of public safety. The defendant is hereby sentenced to 12 counts of retaliation in kind, financial compensation to the families of 4 of the victims, 14 years in prison, being flogged 100 times due to having intimate relationships outside marriage, confiscation of some belongings due to theft, and 4 years in prison... - After you. - No, no, after you. - Hi. - Hi, Haji. How are you? - May God accept your prayer. - I hope so. I'm good, God willing. How about you? You good? - Haji, did they let you come in? - Yes. I've got friends here and there, too. Nice. Thank God. Mr. Haghani is one of those old friends from the war days in Susangerd. - Nice to meet you. - I'm sorry, Mr. Saeed. - No worries. - Sorry you had a rough time in court, but I have to put on a show, I have no choice. He's got his own set of problems, too, but it's all gonna be fine. Isn't it, Haji? Of course. 100%. But the judge looked very serious about the conviction and sentencing. He had to look like that. Tehran is pressuring him. We're all being watched closely by the press. But don't think about it. We have to schedule the next step we're taking for you. - Look, Saeed, - How should we do that? they're gonna take you to carry out the execution sentence. They'll take you through the backyard to a car, and you'll be gone. Okay? That's it. Okay, but what do I have to do, Haji? Nothing, just get some rest, say your prayers... Don't worry about it. We'll take care of everything. Haji, I'm a bit confused. You're right to be confused. Don't worry about anything. Just stay calm. - I really like you, Haji. - Me too. Thank you very much, Haji. May God protect you. - I'm looking after your family too. - That's very kind of you, Haji. - Don't worry about anything. - May God reward you, Haji. Don't mention anything to anyone about our visit here. Even to Fatemeh. It's gotta stay secret. - Of course. Yes. - Do you understand? It's not too late, dear. Repent. Ask for forgiveness. Mother, God is happy with me and I'm happy He's happy. Why would I need to ask for forgiveness? This is not a time to say things like that. When is it, then? You want me to go talk to my son's body when he's up there dead? Don't cry, Mom. Imam Reza is by my side. Did you ever think about your young wife? Did you ever think about her? About your innocent children? You're making them more nervous instead of calming them down. Why, why did you do this to us? You destroyed our lives, Saeed. - Don't cry, honey. - Ali! Is this how you're gonna look after the family? You're gonna be the man of the house like this? Don't cry, dear. - Keep your head up. - Oh, darling... Whatever God wants to happen will happen. Believe in God. Take him. Has the 100 times of flogging sentence been carried out? Apparently, there's been a shortcoming in carrying out that sentence. Take him now. Take it easy! Go easier! Enough! Take him to carry out the execution sentence. You should stay here for now. We have to witness the sentence being carried out. There are already witnesses in there. But we're here for that purpose. You can see the body after the sentence has been carried out. But I talked to you about this. Please stay here. After the sentence is carried out, we'll go together and see the body. What are you doing? What are you doing? Where's the car? What are you doing, Officer? I said where's the car?! Easy, Officer. Haji! Haji, the car... the car... Where's the car, Haji?! Haji! This wasn't the deal! This wasn't the deal! You dirty bastards! You motherfuckin' bastards, this wasn't the deal! Haji! Imam Reza... What are they doing? Imam Reza... What are they doing? You help me. Help me, Imam Reza. What are they doing? What... Let me get them for you. - I'll go by myself. - I'll help you carry them to the bus. Thank you, there's no need. Well, have a good trip, and take care of yourself. - You too. - Thanks. Also, don't put yourself through dangerous situations. I'm not always there to save you. You know, I really enjoyed having you here. I had fun. Not that type of fun, of course. I meant... I enjoyed working with you. You know what I meant. Bye. I wanna say this to everyone who's watching. If the police don't pull the plug on this situation in the streets, someone else like my dad is gonna rise up and follow in his footsteps. They treat these women as if they're ordinary people. If it goes on like this, there'll be another Saeed Azimi. To be honest, from the moment he was arrested, numerous people have asked me to follow in his footsteps. Let's wait and see what happens. Whenever they arrived here, my dad would shut the door, lock it and take the keys with him. Then, he'd give them some money, and they'd stand here and start counting it. Meanwhile, my dad would approach them from behind, hold them by their necks and squeeze as hard as possible. Then, they would lose consciousness and drop on the floor. After dropping on the floor, my dad would sit on top of them, and put his knee on their necks. Wait a moment. Khadijeh, come here for a sec. Ali, it's okay, you can just reconstruct it using the cushions. No, wait a moment. Come. Lie down here with your head to that direction. A little bit further. Lie down straight. He'd sit on top of them and put his knee on their necks like this. And after that... I'm not gonna do it, I'll just show you. Then, he'd put his wrist on their mouths while strangling them with the scarf. That'd be it. What about after that? It requires a lot of power. But since they were addicted and weak, there wouldn't be a problem, he'd do it quickly. What would he do with the body? He'd find something he'd able to cover the body with. For example, like this... I'm dead right now. It's serious. They're filming you. - Don't move. - I'm dead. What a clown! All of it would take around half an hour. Then, like, an hour to get rid of the body. So he'd take care of a prostitute in less than two hours. Translation and subtitles: FeralCx for KG
