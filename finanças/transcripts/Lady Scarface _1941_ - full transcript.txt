Go ahead with your work. I'll be leaving right away. Did you hear that, honey? I'll be round to get you in a taxi, baby. Fifteen flat. What? I wouldn't mind breaking a leg for you. I can still write those checks, can't I. Oh no. Of course you're not interested in that. Well, you're worth it, baby. Just hold everything and I'll be there in a jiffy. Bye-bye. Forty .. right. Thirty .. left. Come on. Give us the next one. Twenty-five .. right. Sixty .. left. Call the police. Robbery. Chicago Security Building. Third floor. Come on, hurry up. Come on now. Beat it. You leaving this guy here until he yaps to the police? When we leave here his yapping days are over. [ Gunshot! ] I'll pick you up at the garage. Mullen, you stake out at the camp. We're heading for New York. - The same pay-off code? Yes. Plant your message in the New York Want Ads. That's right, Sergeant. Power circuit turned off. Janitor's crew trapped in the service elevator between floors. Yeah. I can describe the guy that slugged me. [ Police siren ] [ Police siren ] Sorry, lady. It's alright, sonny. I was supposed to work here tonight but the door was locked. Strike out. Take the stairs. To all Cook County police and deputies. Watch all cars for man answering description of Matt Willis. "Aged 40." "Height. 5 feet 10." "Eyes, hazel." "Grey streak in hair." "Usually well-dressed but last seen in janitor's coveralls." "That is all." That watchman. He gave them that dope. What did you do? Give the guy a picture when you slugged him? I'd like to give you a picture of yourself. Lying in a ditch by the side of the road. You wouldn't do that to me? I will if you get too hot to carry. Look out. It's a railroad crossing. Not it ain't. It's a police block. They got that radio message. Hold tight. They'll flag us off! That's enough of that. Okay. Inside. What's all this camera stuff? What's your name? Ann. - Ann who? Come on, talk. Ann Rogers you lout. Keep your hands off me. Hold it, Mullen. I'll take that. Alright, Tim. You put the cuffs on him. I don't know what I'd do without you, Lieutenant. Say, how did you find me here anyway? What do you think the police department is for? You must learn to keep your nose out of our business. But listen, Bill. You've got to help me. I'm no longer with The Journal. Quick Magazine gave me a better offer. And I came up with a great idea for them. Quick goes to a crime party. Keep on getting in my way .. And you're going to wind up doing one called "Snip goes to jail". Very funny, Lieutenant. Alright, Mullen, where is the dough? - What dough? What are you looking for, Bill? This guy ditched the Pierce loot around here someplace. 10,000 papermen. Say, Lieutenant. If I show where that money is, are we on this case together? You know where it is? - Sure. Okay, okay. It's a deal. - Don't forget. We're on this together. I could have found it in there myself. You sure the dough is in here? Pictures don't lie. To Mary Jordan, care of the Leonard Sheldon Hotel New York city. Who is she, Mullen? - A lady friend. She must be rich to stay at the Sheldon. And she's a pretty ritzy lady too. - Oh yeah. Sure. Aren't you going to open it, Bill? - Yeah. Yeah, I'm going to open it but not right now. Hey, what do you think you're doing? - Taking a picture of Exhibit A. The above picture taken by Quick's photographic detective .. Shows Lieutenant Mason pocketing the Pierce loot. Now that's very nice but I'll just take that. You can't do that. All my pictures are on that roll. Don't worry. I'll develop you film for you. What about my camera? It's worth money. - Yeah? Well so is my job. Come on Mullen. The Captain wants to see you again. Wait a second. You promised we'd work together if I gave you that money. Listen. You're lucky I didn't have you arrested for complicity. Get going. 1,500 detectives in Chicago and they had to assign this case to you. We found about $2,000 on Mullen. Probably his cut. So I figure there is about eight grand still in that envelope. Did Mullen spill anything yet? - No, he didn't. He acted plenty rattled when I mentioned Slade. I'm sure I'm right as the same methods are used by the Slade mob in New York. It'd sure be a feather in your cap if you got your hands on Slade, Lieutenant. Now that's a pretty tough proposition. Slade has never even been mugged or fingerprinted. Don't open that, sir. I have an idea. Yeah? Wherever Slade is, he'll be needing money. That's right. But who is this Mary Jordan? She is probably one of Slade's dolls. Now. I mail this letter just as Mullen planned and then .. Follow it through to the Leonard Sheldon hotel in New York. And there you wait for this Mary Jordan to turn up? It is pretty expensive bait. Why not send through a dummy letter? The Jordan dame might open it. If she found it was full of phonies then she wouldn't lead us to Slade. You send that letter through just as it is. And I'll bring Slade back here for you. Mason, I think you have a hunch on this case. I'll let you follow it through. I'll have the superintendent fix it up for you in New York. Contact Captain Lovell at the 54th Street station. He'll give you every cooperation. Now here is the money. And I'm holding you responsible for it. Good luck. - Thanks, chief. Alright, where are my cameras? So clever of you, Lieutenant. Taking my other cameras from the car last night. Alright Joe, give them back to her. You can have them back but I'll keep the negatives for evidence. That's a pretty dirty trick. What about my job? Tell you what I do. Get me a picture of Slade and you'll have the batch of them. I bet I get the picture before you get the man. Here, give me his weight in US government stamps. You think you own the case? - What case? Oh no, no. I suppose you and the Captain were just discussing the weather? Yes, it is a nice day isn't it. 13 cents straight, Lieutenant. That's my lucky number, Joe. Say .. you don't look so good today. That business last night didn't bother you, did it? How'd you sleep? - I slept alright. You did? Let me see your tongue. Peppermint. Next time I'll make it raspberry. Thanks, Joe. - Hold this for me, Joe. Look Bill, it's my first assignment on this new job. I've just got to make good. There you are. You are now in the hands of the US mail. Until we meet again. I promise I won't get in your way. - No dice. I can't take a chance. Come a pinch and you'll fold up. A dame will do it every time. You've got a heart like an ice-cube. That's not true. Here. Plant that in that rag that you work for. Taxi! And title it: "Chivalry Is Not Dead". It's good for the force. Okay, Lieutenant Mason. You're asking for it. Yes, they check alright. - That's good. Mason, you know Lieutenant Onslow. - Glad to see you again Onslow. I've explained the case to him. You'll work on it together. Good. When do we start, Lieutenant? Well, I suggest that we run over to the Leonard Sheldon Hotel. I've got a letter coming in over there that I don't want to miss. Thanks very much for your cooperation, Captain. Goodbye, sir. - Goodbye. I hope everything was satisfactory. Oh, yes indeed. The Leonard Sheldon is such a lovely hotel. Thank you. I hope you come back again. Thank you. Goodbye. - Goodbye. She sure got away with a lot of silver, Mr Barlow. I wish you'd let me give them a frisk. You know the customer is always right. - We are using plenty of plate. I know but .. [ Dog barking ] A lovely dog. Oh, thank you, ma'am. Sorry buddy. We don't allow dogs in the lobby. But wire-haired sir. I don't care what kind hairs they got. This ain't the place for them. See that? Okay, Constable. I got an advertisement here. A young lady. Wants 2 thoroughbred wire-hair terriers delivered to the Leonard Sheldon hotel. Okay, okay. But you'll have to take them around to the kennels. The kennels? - You heard me. Why, your kennels ain't fit for a dog. - They're kennels. Some kennels. Come on. What's the matter, Seidel? - Dog trouble. I guy comes in here with a couple of wired-hairs and wants to take them to .. Alright, alright. Detective Seidel, Lieutenant Mason. - Hiya, Mason. So I said to this guy. I said listen, you can't .. Mason? Well, Lieutenant. I'm glad to know you. Sorry you found me in such an un-officerly position. Perfectly alright. - We've been waiting for you. Oh, you have? - It sure is an interesting case. What case? Oh yes, yes. So it is. Anything new? - No, not yet. Mr Seidel, has a letter come in here for a Miss Mary Jordan? Oh, the letter? Just a second. The Lieutenant is here. Please bring out the letter, Miss Rogers. Miss Rogers? - Yes. Me. Careful Lieutenant. That's a lot of money you're letting drop. Now wait just a minute. So sorry. The guests aren't permitted to manhandle the employees. Employees? Yes, they gave me a job when I told them what we were after. Just where did you get that "we" stuff? You and I. Or is it you and me? Anyway, they said they would be very happy to cooperate with us. Miss Rogers told me that you were old friends. Oh she did, did she? Well, if you gentlemen will please excuse me. Now listen to me, my "old friend". If you've blabbed this case all over the lobby .. I have not. You listen to me. Ever since we've been on this case you've acted like a weasel. I offered to work with you. I offered to help. But no, you couldn't take a chance. I was a woman. Well, you're going to take a chance now whether you like it or not. I've got a job to do and if you can't understand it, it's just too darned bad. Now, give me a cigarette. Sorry. I smoke a pipe. Okay, Ann. I'll agree on one condition. I'm the boss. - Alright. Fine. Now let's get to work. When did this come in? - This morning's mail. I don't suppose there's any sign of a Mary Jordan or reservations or anything? No. But the hotel only holds unidentified mail for three days and then returns it. I'm sure Slade knows that. I don't think we'll have to wait long. I hope you're right. All I want is a change to follow this money. Somewhere in this town that guy Slade is waiting for us. That money must be here by now. Maybe Mullen forgot the Want-Ad code? He didn't forget the code. Well, if he knows what's good for him he didn't. Here you are. - What you been doing, printing it? Boss, you put me right behind the 8-ball every time you send me out. This town is plenty hot for us and you know it. Shut up. Here it is. Here is the code from Mullen. "Wanted. Two thoroughbred wire-haired terriers." "Promise good home. Will pay reasonable price." "Can be reached May 2nd or 3rd Leonard Sheldon Hotel." "Mary Jordan." That's what we've been waiting for. Lefty, this girl of yours. You're sure she's on the level? Yeah, sure. Ruby has handled plenty of hot stuff in Chicago. Yes, but does she look like a lady? The hotel isn't like this dump. And remember. Her name is Mary Jordan when she calls for that letter. Why don't you have Lefty bring her round so we can take a gander at her. I don't want even her knowing about this hideout. Wait. I've got a better idea. You know George Atkins? George is the kid who looks like he is fresh from college. Sweet and innocent. That's the one. Get him. Send him to the hotel with your Ruby dame. They are married. Mr and Mrs. Got it? - Yeah. Yes. But that means we have to split that cut for the job. So they split the cut. What do you care? Or do you? Say, what is this Ruby to you, Lefty? I know her. You two weren't thinking of skipping with that dough, were you? You've always trusted me ain't you, Slade? No. Not when you've been mixed up with dames, I haven't. Sem, you'd better go along with Lefty. Just in case. Well, that shouldn't bother you. Not if you're on the up and up. For all you know, that cut might not come through. Just try that. And see that fancy-pants Atkins and your Ruby get that letter. Alright, Slade. Good day. Hello. Reservations for Mr and Mrs James Powell please. Just a moment. I'll see. Thank you. You know Lieutenant, I've been wondering. I'm taking a fingerprinting course at night-school. I thought maybe there'd be an opening for a good man on the Chicago force? What's wrong with the New York force? - Well .. Confidentially Lieutenant, they're getting soft. Crime has fallen off. There is no chance for a man with real imagination. Oh, I see. Well sure, I tell you what I'll do. When I get back to Chicago .. I'll talk to the commissioner about you. - You'd do that, Lieutenant? - Glad to. That would be great. When you speak to him would you mind showing him this? What is it? - It's my report card. All "A"s. - Oh. Here we are. Room 1608. Also, do you have a letter here for a Mary Jordan? That's my wife's maiden name. Mary Jordan? Yes, that's right. Just a moment. I'll see. Have we a letter here for Mary Jordan? I'll look. Here you are. Here you are, Miss Jordan. - I'll take it. It's a good think this is here. It would have been too bad if it wasn't. Hey, you'd better see a man about his dogs. I told that guy. I thought I told you to take them dogs to the kennels. But they don't like it in the kennels, Constable. They much prefer it here. Besides, they are advertised. Sure they're advertised. So is horses. But we don't allow horses in the lobby. Now get them out of here. 1608, huh? Get over by the elevator and ride up with them. Don't let them out of your sight. It's quite alright, ma'am. They won't hurt you. I'm sorry, ma'am. That settles it. You and these mutts go to jail. Look Jimmy, Aren't they adorable? - Yeah. Hiya, fellah. Pedigreed, ma'am. I don't suppose they are for sale? Sorry, sir. The hotel doesn't allow dogs in the rooms. Oh, I see. I guess you are out of luck, fellah. Well sir, here is my card. If you should find yourself wanting a dog .. I've a bit of a pet-shop here round the corner. "Hartford" is the name. Thank you. - Thank you, sir. As for you, Constable. I think it's contemptible of you to deprive the little fellows of a home. Get out. Get! Very well. Ha! Au revoir, gendarme. None of that. None of that. Get out. That guy has been a nuisance all day with this Ad for them dogs. What Ad? In the paper here. He just tried to sell one of them to that young couple. Oh, a Mary Jordan? This is all starting to add up. How did Mullen plant this in the paper before I picked him up? Telephone. For me? Telephone who? I mean .. I don't get you, Lieutenant. - Now look, Seidel. This Ad is a code. I've been trying to find it in the Chicago editions but I couldn't. Because Mullen phoned it in to a New York newspaper before I grabbed it. Oh, I get you. So the little squirt with the dogs must be one of the mob. No, no. I don't think so. He probably just answered this Ad by mistake. It was pretty smart of Slade to use such a nice young couple for his contact. Come on. Is there anything else, sir? - No, that's all. Thank you. Thank you. Look. We've got enough rice here for our first meal. Got a passkey? - Right here. This will be alright. You can tell the desk clerk. Mrs James Powell? - Yes. Would you sign for this package please. - Alright. Balfour. C.O.D. 483 dollars and 27 cents. I'll take care of that. - Thank you. Here you are. Come on, honey. Wait until you see what's in it. Darling, you gave that man a check for over 400 dollars. Sure I did. And I'll show you what he gave me. Jimmy, it's beautiful. Try it on. - Oh, gosh. Come on over here and look at yourself. Oh, it's lovely. You shouldn't have done that. Boy, you look like a million. $400 is an awful lot. Nothing is too good for my wife. Yes. But do we have that much money in the bank? Not yet, but we will have. Just as soon as I airmail this check from uncle Ben back home to the bank. What check? 0pen it. It's a check for a thousand dollars. A wedding present from uncle Ben. Well, why is it addressed to me? - The bride always gets the presents. Didn't you know that? Go ahead, darling. Open it. That's funny. Sending cash through the mail. I wonder why he didn't send a check. Jimmy. This letter. It's postmarked Chicago. Uncle Ben lives in Albany. I don't understand. It has your name on it. Well, there must be another Mary Jordan in this hotel. Jimmy, what are we going to do? This money isn't ours. And you gave that man a check. And this hotel. What are we going to do? - Mary. Take it easy, dear. Well. We can at least take the coat back. Then all we'll have to worry about is .. The hotel bill. I can take care of that alright. We could take the coat back. But I'm still in a fix. That check covered presents I bought for your mother and sister. Oh, Jimmy. Wait a second. Let's see how much money we've got here. Do you mind letting me get my thumb out of my mouth? They're talking in there but I can't hear what they say. I guess I'll have to get a Dictagraph planted. You know something, Lieutenant. That young couple don't look like gangsters to me. Hello. Let me talk to Seidel please. Maybe not, but they've still got that $8,000. Besides, they tie up with this Want Ad. It may not mean much but remember the girl spoke to the dog man downstairs. Hello, Seidel? Get a hold of the house electrician and have a Dictagraph installed in 1608. Yep. Yeah and then get up here yourself as soon as you can. Right. No funnies? Holy mackerel. 8,000 bucks. We'd better phone downstairs. - Just a minute. I'm in a jam. That store has my check and it's no good. But Jimmy this money isn't ours. - I know that but I'll pay it back. I'll wire uncle Ben to send the money and everything will be alright. Jimmy, that's just crazy. - Hold it, Mary. If that check bounces I go to jail. What do you think will happen if you take that money? I won't let you do it, Jimmy. You're getting yourself into more trouble. But honey, I'm only borrowing it. Now, everything is going to be alright, Mary. You stay right here and I'll be right back. He just left his room. Okay Seidel, you stay here and don't let her leave that room alone. You come downstairs with me. If he leaves, follow him. What about you? I'm going to stay here and do a little checking on our friend Miss Jordan. And I'm left holding the bag, huh? No thank you. You agreed that I was boss, didn't you? Now come on, do as I say. Alright. I guess I'll just have to pick up Slade myself. There will be no picking up until I say so. Come on. Good day. Have you a letter here for Mary Jordan? - Just a moment. I'll see. Is there a letter here for Mary Jordan? Another Mary Jordan. - Yeah. This one looks like the real McCoy. We'll wait until they get outside and we'll pick them up there. Not a thing. There was a letter here for Mary Jordan but it's been called for. Are you sure about that? - I'm positive. Oh, never mind. Come on. We're being tagged. Get going. Follow that sedan. Where is the dough? - I don't know. We just got told someone had picked it up. Better be true. If it ain't, Slade will be awful unhappy. It is the truth, see. - Then there's nothing to worry about. Except shaking those coppers. I recognise Big Sem in that car. There must be two Mary Jordans. Too bad this one scared so quick. Yeah. And this is our only lead to Slade. Don't worry. We haven't lost it yet. Give it back to them. - I don't like this. Pull your rod, you rat! Hello Lefty. Nice to see you again. What have you got there? - A check for a short beer. Alright. Get back in the car. Doogan, you drive. Okay. What can I do for you, sir? - I want to talk to the credit manager. Your name? - James Powell. Why did you wish to see Mr Pinchback? Regarding a check I gave the store for a C.O.D. package. Very well. If you will just be seated over there. Thank you. Pretty tough making those payments sometimes, isn't it. Are you in a spot too? Yeah. Kind of. [ Buzzer ] Mr James Powell. Yes. Mr Powell, you may go in now. Good luck. Thanks a lot. Thank you. And what can I do for you, Mr Powell? I've come to see you about a check I gave the store earlier in the afternoon. I've not sufficient funds in the bank to meet it and .. Not sufficient funds? Do you realize .. Let me explain and bring the cash. - There can be no explanation. Oh. Cash? Did you say "cash"? Yes. If you'll give me my check I'll give you the money for it. Have a cigar, Mr Powell. Now let me see. How much was your check for? 483 dollars and 27 cents. I will telephone the cashier and have him send up your check. Fine. [ Buzzer ] Yes? "There is a call here for Mr Powell." Telephone for you, Mr Powell. - For me? Yes? Hello, Jimmy? The check arrived from uncle Ben. So there is no need for you to use the money. That's great. Now look. Endorse it and send it airmail to our bank right away. Okay. I'll be right home, darling. Good news I trust? - You bet. That check is okay. You won't need this and I won't need that. Good day. How did it go? - Great. You have no idea. A letter got me into a jam and I just received another one just got me out. Oh, good luck to you. Did you wish to see me, young lady? Umm. Yes. I'd like to borrow your phone if I may. You will find the pay phone downstairs. Of course. I tell you I never heard of this Slade guy. Come on, Lefty. Come on, loosen up. Where is your boss? - I don't know what you're .. You're talking about. Hello? Lieutenant Mason? One moment, Miss Rogers. Tell her that I .. No, wait a minute. I'll take it. Hello? Hello yourself, Lieutenant. Seidel told me you were at the station. What's the idea of ditching me? Oh, that's great, Ann. Good work. What else did you find out? What do you mean, what else did I find out? What are you handing me? You knew those kids picked up that money by mistake. They haven't got a thing to do with the gangsters. Oh, that's fine. Fine. I got it to hand it to you honey. That's just what we wanted to know. Now you stick with that $8,000. Listen, you double-crossing double-talker. What do I care about your old $8,000? You promised I'd be with you when you picked up Slade. Yes and that cinches it. Now you go back to the hotel and wait for me. If she calls again, tell her I've left. Ah, it's kind-of bad news for you, Lefty. Except we got the dope on this girl who calls herself Mary Jordan. She's meant to be Mullen's sweetheart. - You'd better go easy there, copper. Well, is she? - No, she ain't. And any guy that says she .. - Sit down. Oh, so that's how it is. Bring in the girl, Onslow. Now listen, Lefty. We picked up Mullen in Chicago. Yes. And he spilled the works. That it was you that killed Pierce. Mullen is lying. Maybe, but that's not going to stop me from proving that you did that killing. We'll start wiring that seat for you right now. Lefty! Don't you fall for that bluff. He knows Slade gunned that guy. Oh Slade, huh? Thanks. That's all I wanted to hear. You can write it out but I won't sign it. Then I'd as soon send you up as Slade. If he stays dumb it's what will happen. You've got to talk, Lefty. You're racing yourself straight for the chair. Shut up. Look. I'll spend a summer sitting here. But I ain't singing. Come on, get out of here. - Babe, I'm warning you. Get me out of here! Sit down, Miss Jordan. If I tell you all I know. Could you kind-of ease things off for Lefty? Well, I can't promise anything, but if you'll help us we'll try and help you. Anyway. Lefty and me won't be taking no rap to help Slade. He should have showed hours ago. Wait until I get hold of that Lefty. I've got an idea Lefty won't wait for you to get hold of him. We'll hear from Sem alright. Yeah. If Lefty ain't knocked him off. The police saying: "grab the four of them". I guess it would break in the papers if they had. You go down to Louie's. Buy every edition that comes out. |I ain't going to do it. You ain't what? You ain't got any right to keep sending me off like this. Giving the cops a chance to groove me. You'll get it alright. And it won't be by the cops. Get those papers. And that's the honest truth. I've never seen this guy Slade. I was only in on this job .. So Lefty and me could use the money to put a thousand miles between us and him. Did you ever see this before? It's the old personal column grapevine. What is the dog angle? Well, Lefty says each one of them is given a name of a different kind of dog. Slade. He's called a Great Dane. Oh. What's Lefty's code name? Mexican hairless. Alright, Miss Jordan. Thank you very much. I'll do everything that I can to see that you get the breaks. May I have a piece of paper, Captain? I'd like to run this in the personal column of all the late editions. I think we just about got time to make it. When Slade read this .. Those kids up in 1608 will find they're holding a load of dynamite. So you're seeking the Great Dane on a decoy. Unless I missed my guess, Slade will uncover himself trying to get the money. And when he shows up at the hotel I'll be there to meet him. You keep on grilling Lefty. He rides on his nerve and he hasn't got much left. Oh, darling. You see, everything turned out alright. You were very lucky, Jimmy. - As lucky as the day I met you. Believe me from now I am going to take your advice. Where's the envelope? I must get the cash back before anything happens to it. I put it right over here. I thought I had better hide it. Darling, you had better take that money downstairs right now. I will. But not just yet. Sit down. I've got a surprise for you. What's this? A bib. In just a few minutes that door is going to open. And in comes a man, with a great big tray. And on it? Two hamburger sandwiches. With mustard, onions, relish, tomatoes. Everything you can think of. And champagne. Hamburgers and champagne? Oh Jimmy, you're crazy. Crazy over you, honey. Oh, it's you, Lieutenant. I thought I told you to stay upstairs and watch that Jordan girl. Your assistant Miss Rogers, said those kids have nothing to do with the mob. And after I went and used my best technique to get that Dictagraph in. You did get it in though? - Sure. The receiver is under the couch. The drugstore is sending over some sandwiches. Will you have a boy bring them up. - Okay. Hello, honey. What's the idea of giving me all that fancy double-talk and then hanging up? I thought we agreed to work together. I say, we've never worked better together in our lives. The telephone call you made came just in the nick of time. You mean, you got Slade? - No. But I got four of his gang. What they been doing in there? - They have .. How should I know? Now you mean to tell me you haven't listened just a little bit? Of course not. Those kids in there are innocent. Sure they are innocent. No harm in listening to a little music is there? Since when have you been so interested in music? I've always been interested in music. Particularly, good music. Say, that must be some grub I ordered. Will you get it for me please? Wait a second. - Uhuh. [ Door knocks ] Alright. 65 cents please. Yeah. It's your spread alright. Have you got 65 cents? Pay the man, will you, sweet? Charge it to the room. - Yes, ma'am. I'm half starved. Hmm. Smells good. Tuna. Right out of my favorite ocean. Hmm. A thin slice of bread between two thick slices. You know, if we just had some nice cold lard to go with this. Now, don't be bitter. Let's see what the kiddies are doing. "I could dance forever with you, Jimmy." Hamburgers and champagne. Come in. Mr Powell? - Yes. Bring it right in. Boy. Monsieur. I am very sure you will enjoy this very much. Our cuisine. It is by far the best. Here it is. Soup Ratatouille. In my country it takes five days to make this soup. It is a cause for a celebration. First they roast the whole bull stuffed with mushroom. In an enormous black pot. In the same pot they throw hundreds of rare herbs. And then a superb wine, a prize vintage is added. It is so thick. So delicious. So wonderful. But I don't like it. Madame, s'il vous plait. Monsieur, please. Here you are, Madame. Your coat please. No thank you. I think I will wear it. And now. Lobster. Thermidor. Very rich. "Very rich." It sure makes my tuna taste real good. You cheapskate. You can have your lobster. What good is it on a sandwich? One more bite of this and I'm going to start jumping up a waterfall. You are thinking of salmon, not tuna. The way this tastes, I'm thinking of tuna. In fact at the moment, I can't think of anything else. Well, don't forget it was your idea to get on this case. Yeah, but I'd like to know why we sit here eating instead of out after Slade. Oh. Got to keep up our strength, don't we. "Pol Roger in a fine year." Now there is a guy that knows how to treat a lady. Now there is a guy that's got eight grand. Say, what about that eight thousand? Oh I'm keeping it. It's safe enough. Acting awful casual about that, Lieutenant. I don't trust you. I think you've got something up your sleeve. Impossible. [ Laughter ] Thank you very much. I thought it was funny myself. Marriage is a wonderful thing. I myself have been married six times. And still it is not enough. The more the merrier. Anything else, Monsieur? That's all. Thanks. Perhaps a little music from the main dining room? Yes please. - Merci. A couple of honeymooners, huh? What's the matter with that? Well, according to the voice of experience in the next room, nothing. Personally, I don't know. Wait until the right girl comes along. Yeah? "I've never been so happy, Jimmy." "Do you like being married?" "Love it." "Believe me, you are the one girl in the world as far as I am concerned." Is that guy kidding? Or does a girl go for a line like that? Almost invariably. I don't understand it. Have some more coffee. Ah, you're spilling it all over me. Gee Ann, I'm sorry. That was clumsy of me. It'd cost me less to take you to dinner. - I'll make it up to you. Say, when we get back to Chicago .. I'll show you a steak that will make this lobster thermidor and champagne .. Taste worse than those sandwiches. "Hold me closer, Jimmy." Oh, let's don't be crude. We can't go on listening to those kids. It's personal. Wait a minute. Turn it on. I know it's personal but .. But what? Well, I thought maybe we could dance? You thought we might what? - I thought we might dance. Well, it's been a long time since I tried tripping the light fantastic. Been a long time since you tried tripping, period. Got to work this dinner off somehow. My, you're smooth. Now I know why they call you flatfoot. Listen. Every game has its hazards. Wait. "Just think of all the months we were in love and didn't know it." Thanks, fellah. It's hard to believe other people feel the same way we do. It seems to belong only to us. Other people don't have the real thing. It's only a cheap imitation. "I'm sure it's a very cheap imitation." I don't suppose they could mean us, do you? I don't know. The cheap imitation is the part I don't like. Speak for yourself. You aren't always going to have everything around. Ann, I .. "Kiss me, darling." Ann, I guess you know I love you. Thanks for letting me in on the secret. Hey. Remind me to thank that guy. He did me a big favor. You can do it personally when I pick up the money. Oh, the money. Yes, well .. Ann, about those youngsters next door. There is something I have to tell you. [ Dog barking ] Hello. How you doing, Guvnor? I see from the paper you're interested in buying a dog. I don't believe so. Dear, do you remember advertising for a Great Dane? Excuse me, but I think he's got the wrong room. The lady that wants to buy the dog is over here. Sorry to have bothered you, brother. - That's alright. Hey. How much will you take never to let me see you again? Never see me again? Would five bucks hurt you? That's beside the point. Here. Thank you, Guvnor. You won't regret it. Goodnight. - Wait a minute. Okay, four bucks then. - No. You can keep the money. I gave you the $5 to get rid of the dog. Now take him and beat it. Okay. Goodnight, Guvnor. Come on, Hamlet. I may have known. Putting an Ad in the paper telling Slade where to find his money. Look, Ann. I guessed you were pulling a fast one. I just never dreamed you'd go so far as to use two innocent kids as bait. I know. I know, Ann. I know just how you feel. I feel the same way. It's almost as if we knew the kids in there. It was a way to get the killer out in the open. I meant to say about it. Sure. If you had the nerve. Now listen. There comes a time when snapshots stop and work begins. This kind of a job is no picnic and you knew it when you started. As long as everything is sweetness and light you think it's just great. Comes a pinch and you fold up. I should have known. A dame does it every time. Alright. But I'll not let you get away with it. I'll go next door and tell the kids what they're up against. You're not going anywhere. You'll stay right here. Don't forget I'm still boss on this case. [ Telephone ] Hello. Mason speaking. Yes. Onslow? Yes. Wait a minute. Let me write that address down. Yes. What is it? Aha. Yeah, I got it. Alright, yes. You meet me. Right away. What happened? Come on. Let me in on it. Well, you can stop worrying about your love-birds. Onslow just cracked Lefty and I'm going to pick Slade up on his home grounds. Her we go again. Let me have Seidel. As you're interested in the kids, I'll let you stay and keep an eye on them. Seidel? I want you come up here and see that Miss Rogers doesn't leave the room. That's right. For no reason whatsoever. Yeah, and step on it. But you agreed. I know I did, but I'm no longer agreeing because from now on you're off the case. You're a fine sport. I tell you you're wrong and you can't take it. I can't take it and you can't go. Let me out of here! "To interested parties." "Thoroughbred Great Dane wanted at Leonard Sheldon hotel." "Ask room 1608. Mary Jordan." That thing is in every bulldog edition. Big Sem put it in. He's telling me where I can find certain parties that crossed me up. Lefty and his girlfriend. Yeah? I suppose it was just too much trouble for Sem to come here and tell you. Maybe the bulls are tagging him too close. It smells like a stake-out to me. Well. I've played longer shots than this before to get dough. Without the pleasure of running down a couple of prize rats. How many? Give me three. Four. What have you got? - Deuces. How many? - Two. They are good. You sure are lucky, Miss Rogers. Yeah. At cards, anyway. I hope Lieutenant Mason has got your luck. That Slade pulls a mean trigger. - Shut up, will you! Hello? Would you please get me Captain Lovell at the 54th Street police station. Hello? Oh. Hello, Miss Rogers. Yes. Mason left here ten minutes ago with a special detail. Anything I can do for you? Yes. Would you please let me know how he makes out just as soon as possible. Thanks. Yes, I'll wait here until I hear from you. That's the place over there. Frank. You stay here and watch those windows. - Right. I'll get around the rear. You take the basement. Shut that door! Get back! Open up Slade or we'll blow you out of there. Slade ain't here. This man isn't Slade. He's Matt Willis. I'm afraid Slade skipped, Lieutenant. Come on, come on. Break it up. Come on, break it up. Come on, Matt. How long since you've seen Slade? Come on, where is Slade? How should I know where she is? She? [ Telephone ] No. You'd better answer it and see if Bill's alright. If that flatfoot knew how much I really cared about him, he'd .. He would be more unbearable than ever. Yeah? - Is it Bill? Yeah. He's okay. Take those Powell kids into my room and keep them there. Slade has skipped and is on the loose. Yeah. Yeah, I'm on my way right now. I'll be there in time to handle things. Oh, and Art. Art, you could do me a big favor. Something has happened that could make me look like an awful dope. Run through Ann's things without her getting wise .. And see if you can find a picture of me with my arms around an old scrub woman. Yeah. Look in her purse if you get a chance. And tear up that picture. Okay, Lieutenant. If he's alright, what was all that one-sided conversation about? We was just doping out our technique. That's all. Slade is on the loose. Bill wants those Powell kids brought in here. Kept safe. What are you up to? What? I thought you wouldn't mind if I took a cigarette. Hey, that gun is loaded. In that case, take the cigarette and put the rest of that stuff back in my bag. Give me that bag. I'll go next door to get the Powell kids and be right back in a moment. But you are not supposed to leave this room. The way you're dressed, I doubt the hotel would approve of you following me. [ Buzzer ] I'll get it. Who is it? Police department. Open up. - Police? That's right. You were the girl at Balfours this afternoon. I followed you. Alright, where is that money? Well, you see we were going to return it in the morning. There was some little mistake. It had my wife's name on it. The money is all here. You will find that everything is alright. Alright, skip it. Come on, get in this room. Come on. Art. See that they don't leave or try to use the phone. [ Buzzer ] Who is it? Here's your extra blankets, ma'am. Oh yes. Thank you. Please hurry, will you. I'm expecting company. Stay right where you are. Are you Mary Jordan? Yes. No. Where is your boyfriend, Lefty Landers? Lefty? Hurry up. Talk. He's .. I don't know. - You know alright. Come on, we'll find him. I tell you, I don't know anything about your Lefty .. Whatsisname. - Skip it. Shell out that dough. And hurry. How do I know if I give you that money you won't take it and kill me? How do you know I won't kill you anyway? What the ..? Where's Ann? - Well, she .. I thought I said not to let her out the room. I know, but I .. "Alright Slade. I'll get you the money." Let me have your passkeys. You want to count it? - I ain't got time for counting. Drop it! Both of you. You and your stake-out. You dumb flatfoot. You stepped in over your head this time, copper. So Lefty squealed, eh? And led you right to the Great Dane. Well, it won't do you any good. Keep your hand off that gun! You're through, copper. They should have put a man on this job. Onslow. You alright? - Sure, I feel fine. Ann. What a woman. Whatever happened to that picture of you hugging Slade? Well, look Ann. Look at this one of our sweet, young innocent friends. We sure handed them a thrill for a wedding present didn't we. Yeah. But whatever happened to that picture of you hugging Slade? 0h. You mean the one that you .. Oh, I don't know. The negative got burned up or something like that. But I said if they didn't print this one of you .. The department wouldn't let them release the story. Why, of all the mean, contemptible tricks. Now wait a minute, Ann. Don't be silly. We've just tried to give you a build-up. - Some build up. Now listen, Ann. Well, I don't seem to have Dictagraph with me but .. I guess you know how I feel. Will you marry me? Some cupid. Oh yeah? r-o-d-e
