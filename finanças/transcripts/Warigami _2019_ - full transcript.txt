Thank you for waiting. Final boarding call for Flight... Haven't seen a paper passport in a while. So Ms... Teramoto, I'm just gonna cut to it. Your passport was flagged "DWC." I've worked customs 15 years; I had to look up what that means. Do you know what it means? It means "Detain Without Contact." Bunch of scary guys above my pay grade are on the way now. They don't even want me in the room with you. You have no criminal record that I can find, so do you wanna explain to me why our government's flagging you like you're al-Qaeda? Ms. Teramoto? Do you speak English? Was she armed? Just the bag. Don't touch that. Ahh! Ahhhhh! - Really? - Yeah. Cool. Where were you? I mean, I messaged you around... Whatcha watchin'? I don't know. Real Housewives of something. - Wanna watch something? - Nah, got a busy day today. What do you got? Got hot yoga, couple of work meetings over lunch, and packing for a scuba trip to Grand Cayman. - Sweet - You should come. Can't. Hosting a Victoria's Secret fundraiser this weekend. Those girls know how to party. Who the hell are you? Scatter! Oh, you are so dead! We are so dead! - My necklace! - No, no, no! I got it! ...they just ran out! No! Just right now! Ungh! Thank you! Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. Easy, man, it's just a necklace Did we get anything out of there? Burger joint gift card. I guess we know where we're getting lunch. Boom. Maxed out the balance. Aw, come on, man. No. No. Don't pull that Mother Theresa again, man, - I'm starving. - Here. Should last you a while. You know, technically, we're homeless too! Hey, Mr. Banta. What do you got for me? You know, we ran into a little bit of a snafu at the last place, but uh... Snafu? I don't want to hear "snafu"! You bring me fresh loot, or I use the footage. Wait! No, no, no. You don't need to use that footage. We just need to hit up another place. - Give us two hours. - One hour. Well, we need a little bit of time to... And we're dead again. Do you know what your problem is? Toxic friendships that sabotage my potential? Okay, you are taking that court-mandated counseling way too seriously. So which one looks good to you? Vincent? Ow! Hey, hey. Stop, stop, stop! Hey, man, what is it? You don't hear that? Hey, man, where are you going? We just watched him leave. It doesn't get cleaner than that! Well, what if someone else lives there? There's no lights on in the house. What if he has a live-in assistant? "What if" is gonna be on your tombstone. Come on! - Doesn't even have a TV. - What is this guy, Amish? Vincent? What? What is it? Maybe he's a very fit older gentleman. He is not. Good afternoon. I would ask you what you're doing in my house, but given the damaged window downstairs, I'd say burglary is a safe assumption. Uh, we don't wanna hurt anyone. Why are you in a bathrobe? Don't worry about the bathrobe. We're just here for phones, laptops, anything with a hard drive. I don't think they have any, man. So if you just wanna give us whatever you've got, then we'll be on our way. I propose a different arrangement. The two of you fight me. - Fight you? - Correct. If you win, you can have anything in the house. If you lose, you will leave immediately... - if you still can. - Okay, listen up, Fight Club, we're robbing you, okay? And we're dangerous criminals, like dragon energy bad dudes, so stop playing around before we're forced to get ugly. Ugly is exactly what I want. Why do you think the house has no security? Sometimes I even just leave the doors open. You're the third break-in this year. I'm undefeated... so far. - Why are you doing this? - Shall we begin? - I'm not hitting a girl. - Ungh! Oh... Okay, I'm gonna let that go all right? But... Agh! Ungh! Ungh! All right, fun's over, now we're really gonna... - No need to help, Mark! - Yeah, you got it, man! So I feel like you've learned your lesson. - Get back here! - No! Easy! Fight back! Come on! Yo, man, is it weird if we call the police on her? - How did you do that? - I... what did I do? You're Kamijin? - What? - Come on, let's go. I did it. I did it! Wait! Wait! Wow... Go! Thank you! That wasn't real, right? I mean there is no way I saw what I saw in there, right? - What'd you do to that paper? - I don't know. You don't know? You were doing it, man! I don't know what I did, okay? It just happened! Besides, we have way bigger problems, okay? We gotta get outta town. Ungh! Mr. Banta! Hey, we were just comin' to see ya. This is, this is my favorite part. Sorry, I didn't understand. I said, this is my favorite part. This gets me every time. Well, you destroyed like half of my living room but it's worth it for comedy gold. Now... we had an agreement. You were gonna bring me premium loot every week, on time, and I don't show America's Funniest Home Invasion Video to your parole officers. You got my hardware? - Yeah, no problem. - No. Not yet. That's too bad. This is like, what, third strike for you guys? That's a lotta time in a cage. Stop! Delete all your copies of that footage and leave us alone. - Vincent, what're you doing? - What's that? I got this. You guys are funny, I'll give you that. Some balls on you. About what just happened... I... I know we both said some things we regret... What up, known associates?! It's your boy Banta here! Today, got a couple of employees who need a lesson in manners. So today's tutorial is how do you kneecap someone. Boom! Uh, give us anything... a job so stupidly dangerous that you wouldn't bother, and we'll do it! Huh. How? Let's just say we have a new trick up our sleeves. Ah, like a, like a hack? Yeah, sure. Kinda. There's a card game over at the Pho House downtown. All the big dark Web social media mobsters will be playing, but, uh, security's tight. I mean, like it is... It... it's like a death trap in there. I wouldn't waste any of my people on it. - We'll do it. - No, we won't. Well, I'll text you the deets, and set you up as the dealer, but um... don't mention my name. And don't let me down again. How have we survived this day, man? - Grandfather! - Mr. Ohata. - I can do it. - What? It happened. Just now. And I was right, stress and danger unlocked it, just like I thought! I'm a kamijin! Two burglars broke in and I did it. I finally did it! Slow down. What're you talking about? Just watch. Hmm! I don't understand. It was working. I was doing it! We were both doing it. We were throwing paper at each other. You... you were fighting with paper? - Yes - How long ago? I don't know. Half an hour? We have to leave right now. What's happening? The Akuma have trackers who can sense when Kamijin use their abilities. Stay in here and stay quiet. - Let me help you. I can fight. - I don't want your help. I told you, I don't want you here! James Ohata. Ungh! Ahhh! What're you doing? Are you, are you gonna pack or what? I don't get it. It was doing it before. Okay, look, unless you have some kind of secret plan to rob the card game, it is bail-o-clock, man. Let's go! Ow! There it is! I-I-It's working. It's working. - But why is it working now? - Because of me. Whoa! How did you find us? Your address was on the pizza receipt you used to destroy our lamp. - Do you live here? - Yeah, we have an understanding with the owner. What understanding? Well, we live here and he doesn't know about it. 'Kay, look, we're a little busy here. Can we help you? No, you can't. But I am stuck with you anyway. What? Where did you get that? From our grandfather. - I'm saying I'm your sister. - No, I got that. - You didn't say anything. - It was a lot. - I was gathering my thoughts. - Fine, I will do it again. Please pay attention this time and try to respond promptly. You don't need to do that. - I'm your sister. - Okay. James Ohata. Okay. I prepared a great deal for this moment, and now that it's here, words are failing me. Whatever you're selling, I'm not interested. I'm Wendy. Your granddaughter. - You got the wrong house. - No, I don't. I've been researching our family for the past two years. What the hell are you, Nancy Drew? No. Just a trust-fund kid with a lot of free time. I know my parents, your daughter, were murdered and the police have barely investigated. What part of "not interested, wrong house," do you not understand? I know you're in hiding from someone, I know they're powerful, that's why you changed your name and gave me and my brother up for adoption... but I don't know who or why. I want the truth about our family. You shouldn't be here. It took a while, but eventually he let me into his life. Sort of. More like it was easier to let me in than try to get me to go away. I learned our family are kamijin: we can change the density of paper with a touch. Light as a feather, hard as metal. But I couldn't do it. I trained. I tried everything for almost two years, but I couldn't do it. Until I met you. Right, so hold on, let me, let me get this straight. You're saying that you two are brother and sister. Twins. And you have, like, paper powers. They're not powers. The Japanese call it Kamijin. Right. And you're saying that your parents had these powers too and that's why they died? My parents died in a car accident. Our parents died in a car, but it was not an accident. They were murdered by the Akuma. Mm. Those are the bad paper people. That is an oversimplification. Our family are Guardians. We protect a very dangerous weapon that the Akuma want. That's why they killed our parents, that's why they have grandfather, and that's why you have to help me save him. - What? What's wrong? - No, I love it. It's great. Honestly, I thought I'd heard it all, but that is gold. Little pro tip: simplify the story. Because when your mark gets confused, the hustle falls apart. What's your first memory, Vincent? Mine is a fountain when I was four years old. I was given this necklace and there was a boy there with me. We were left there and told to wait. You think it's a coincidence you broke into my house? It's the Kamijin in our blood, Vincent. It draws us together. I mean you do kinda look alike. Oh no... no, I'm not saying that you both look alike because you're both Asian. No, I'm just saying that you... In addition to both being brother and sisters... I'm just saying that you... yeah, I'm gonna shut up. Forty-one, forty-two, forty-three, forty-four, forty-five, forty-six, forty-seven, forty-eight, forty-nine... fifty. - Just lost it. - I did as well. How far is that? - About fifty feet. - Grandfather did say the ability mutates every generation. It seems this is ours. We have to be near each other. - That's a hell of a catch. - It is a hindrance, I agree, but it's a manageable variable. Why do you always talk like you're studying for the SATs? Why do you talk like you never studied anything? - Burn. - Time is of the essence. We need to start preparing for the mission - to rescue grandfather. - Whoa, what? No, I'm not rescuing anybody. This is your family, Vincent. Mark is my family. Ten years in foster care. Where were you or Mr. Ohata then? I am not leaving until you agree to assist me. Then I hope you packed your toothbrush. So what do we do here? I mean you don't believe any of this, do you? No way. She can't actually be my sister, right? She's annoying as (slice). - She's kinda cute, though. - What? You have a thing for her? After everything that's happened today, that's all you can think about is... - That's it. - What's it? That's what we're gonna do. Go ask her out. - Wait. Ask who out? - My sister in there. Just go get her number and ask her to go to lunch or coffee or whatever. - Go as friends. - Why? Just trust me. I can use this paper thing to rob the card game, but she has to be there. - Just go get her number. - I can't. - Why not? - Look at her, man. She has nice hair, and she smells like flowers (slice). - You can do this. - I really can't. - Just trust me. - I really don't. Okay, so we've talked about it and we've decided to help you with your mission thing that you're doing. - Why would I need him? - Yeah, good point. Uh... we're a package deal. And Mark here has something that he needs to ask you. Do you wanna get some cunch? Sorry. I couldn't decide between "coffee" and "lunch," so they kinda both came out there. Hai! Hey. I'm in position. I'm ready too. She's here. Good. Now remember: she's gotta stay within 50 feet of me back here. You sure you measured it right? Yeah, I'm pretty sure, but there's a kitchen between us, so I'm not gonna have a lot of room over here. Table 2, order! What if she figures it out? Relax, she's not gonna figure anything out. I can't do this, man. I'm not good with girls. Come on. Just chew with your mouth closed, and it'll be over before you know it. I'm here for the game. Empty your pockets. What's this? Cards. For the game. First time, huh? Hey, everyone, I'm... Late's what you are. Dealer sits here. I still don't know why we couldn't do this - at the warehouse. - Oh, yeah. You know, Vincent and I actually come here all the time. - It's great steaks. - It's a vegetarian restaurant. Vegetarian steaks. Do you think I could take a quick bathroom break first? Two minutes. Is there sugar? - So where's Vincent? - Yup, he's running a little late. Hey, (slice), you missed a spot! Ahhh! - Ungh! - Agh! - What was that? - I think they're expanding. Agh! Come on! Can we sit over there? I'm uncomfortable being this close to the kitchen. Oh, I, I really don't think we should move over there, it's not really allowed. Ungh! Ungh! Mark, what the (slice)'s going on? You know, I think we should sit over here. I'd really prefer this table. But there's a mouse over there! So? Hey! Yes! - What are you doing?! - Sorry, sorry, sorry. Where is he? - Who? - My piece of (slice) brother! Where you goin'?! I knew I couldn't trust you idiots! Look, I know we're (slices), but Vincent's gonna die if we don't do something. Who put you up to this? Was it Louise? Was it Demetri? Was it Klepto Karl? Are those all real people? Agh! Yes! Ungh! - A little help?! - Hang on! Don't kill them, just knock them out! You think they're trying to knock us out?! Let's go! Let's go! Uh, guys? Give us the money, we'll let you go. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! Can't you just throw individual bills?! Let's go! Vincent, let's go! I am not going to debate this anymore. I saved your life, now you help me rescue grandfather. - It's quid pro quo! - I don't speak Japanese. - Oh my God... - I'm kidding. Look, you threw away 20 grand back there! - So what? - So what? God, you're such a trust-fund kid! Mark and I have to earn everything that we have! I earned what's mine! Don't presume to know about my life! Okay. Easy, killer. Look, big picture, 20 grand is nothing. - Uh, guys? - You're not listening! Every time we use our ability, they can track us. The more we use it, the easier they can find us. - We have another problem. - Your boy Banta here. And uh... just got word that a couple of my employees botched a simple job. I'm gonna give 'em a little performance review, huh Vincent? That's not our parking lot, is it? What the hell are you doing?! I told you to steal the money, not... leave it on the ground in front of the people you stole it from! - There's paper over there. - Talk your way out of it. - Who's she? - She's a friend. Uh, look, we just had a little setback, and we just need a little more... I don't wanna hear about setbacks or snafus! I'm sorry, boys, but... I gotta drop the hammer. All right? It's what my followers expect. Now make sure you keep it steady for the kill shot and... Dude! Vertical! Come on! Now, you want his first shot central thorax. You can always come back later, finesse with a headshot. You know, once they're incapacitated. Ungh! What're you doing? What the...? Ungh! Ungh! You are coming with me. Now can we use it? Yes. Come on! Stay back! - Who are you? - We're your worst night... Ungh! Good form, but too fast. Ahhh! How's my form now? No, no, no, no, no. - Just give me a second. - It's under, then the snake goes through the hole. What snake? Could you please hold her still? Guys, that's definitely wrong; that's a Langford double. This is supposed to be a Yosemite bowline. Oh, shhh! She's awake. Oh my God, I just kidnapped someone. - Relax. - Untie me... or I'll gut you like a pig! So what is the plan here exactly? We're going to ask you some questions. You got lucky with the water. When I get free, I'll show you what pain is. I'm freaking out, man. What knot is this? Langford double. Bad choice. Where are you holding Grandfa... Mr. Ohata? He's your grandfather? We didn't know that. You were wearing this. What is it? Your Oji-san... is being tortured right now. Bleeding everywhere. Begging for mercy. You will tell me. We cut pieces of him off one at a time. - Ahhh! - Whoa, whoa, whoa! Let's just let her stew. Hey, guys, I think we should probably get rid of those bodies. 'Kay, fine, I'll do it. So who exactly is our friend in the shower there? She's Akuma. She knows where they're holding him. We need to make her tell us so we can infiltrate their base and rescue him. Infiltrate? What are we, Seal Team Six? Will this base be full of more people like her? Yes. Okay. Have fun with that. - Excuse me? - Look, I know I owe you for the card game back there, but as far as I'm concerned, let the Akuma have the old bastard. It's not just about him. Mr. Ohata is protecting a very powerful weapon. What kind of weapon? - A magical scroll. - A magical scroll. Yes. So is that like D&D magic? Or like My Little Pony friendship magic? This is not a joke. The Akuma cannot have that scroll, or a lot of people will be killed. Why do you care so much? You were adopted by rich people, you had the good life. Rich people who wanted me for a trophy, not a daughter. I may not have been poor, but I grew up alone just like you. So you think that if we rescue the old fart that he's suddenly gonna start loving us? Wake up, Wendy, he threw us away. Now we can return the favor. Karma's a bitch. Fine! Fine. If you won't consider the moral imperatives, I suppose a financial incentive is my only recourse. Seriously, do you even understand yourself - when you talk? - He's rich. If you rescue him, prove you're family, what's his is yours. - He doesn't care about us. - He is aging, and he needs someone to protect the scroll when he's gone. Help me this one time, and you will never need to break into anything again. If it starts to look like suicide... It won't. I promise. Okay. Fine. We'll look at it. Okay. - Wow. - What? I'm not usually able to convince people to do things. That doesn't surprise me. Does anybody wanna help me with this?! Are you sure this will work? Yeah. Banta was beefing with some drug dealers outside the city. If these bodies show up on their turf, no one's gonna ask questions. - What about his car? - Banta Ubers. Very strange gangster. Okay, don't be gone long. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Because we need the car. Right, yeah. Oh, sorry. I guess sleep's out. This must be what parenthood is like. What do you think this thing is? Could be an identifier, so they know each other. So what does this My Little Pony scroll do, anyway? It's a long story. I think we have time. A long time ago, in Japan, there was a poor village that was constantly being raided by bandits. The villagers couldn't defend themselves; they were just fishermen. Farmers. - What? - They were farmers, not fishermen. If you want to tell the story, tell the truth. They were fishermen. Is that what Oji-san told you? Okay, whatever. They were people, they were poor, they were being beat up on. What happened? One day, a mage wandered into the village, and he feels sorry for the fishermen. So he casts a spell on them that let them use an everyday object to defend themselves. Paper. They were the first Kamijin. Our ancestors. But the power corrupted them, and they started using it to conquer other villages. Chigao. Wrong. The people loved the Kamijin. They made us rulers of all Japan. That's absurd. They became dictators. The Kamijin gave Japan a golden age. No war. No crime. Perfect harmony... That's Akuma propaganda. The Kamijin violently oppressed the people... Okay, stop. I can't track this story if you guys keep arguing. What matters is, the mage changed his mind. So he decided he was going to take the power away from the Kamijin. Any objections? But magic is like energy, you can only transfer it, not destroy it. So the mage locked the full Kamijin power in a scroll, like a prison for the power he regretted bestowing. But a small trace of the power remained in the blood of the descendants, like a residue that wouldn't wash out. It would mutate every generation, changing, evolving. But it was always just a shadow of its original self. So if you get this scroll and read it, what happens? Nobody knows for sure. The legends say the original Kamijin could move paper with their minds, make it explode. They were unstoppable. A few could even take out entire armies. So that's why you want it. We are going to use the scroll to retake Japan. And then we attack the true evil: modern technology. Technology? That's why you're doing all this? Cause you don't like the new iPhone? Nuclear weapons, government spying, pollution rotting the Earth. Humanity is self-destructing because we were not meant to live like this. The Akuma will save us, take us back to the old ways, the natural world. And what if not everyone wants to live in your "natural world"? We take care of it... like we took care of your parents. Wendy, wait! Do it. Come on. Mm! That's for Mom and Dad. Hey! Hey! Ah! Hmph! What the hell is this? "I am caught by the children at the doghouse. They hug me rain. Your news box is safe. They are not trapping your place. They are not razors and they do not understand it." "They're not razors?" Wait, uh... I think I know that symbol. Where? There it is. So this is a box of e-news readers. Says you can read magazines, books, and I'm guessing that's newspapers. Newspapers. Grandfather said he always suspected the Akuma used newspapers to transmit messages. "Thanks, Vincent. Great idea." It makes sense. They wouldn't use technology unless it was an absolute emergency. - Like sending an S.O.S.? - Exactly. Mark, go to the library. Check the microfiche for patterned messages in newspapers. Focus on anything to do with Japanese history. If they're holding grandfather in the city, there might be something about it there. I mean, can't you guys do this? I'm more of the computer guy. We need somebody responsible here to keep an eye on her. Right. Oh, no, don't get up. Paper check. Stop it. Ungh! Ungh! Damn. Sit. Still. Who taught you that backhand? Westmount Girls Tennis Club. I was a rich girl, too. And then you became a terrorist. I learned there was a war going on and I was born on the wrong side. I wasn't born on the wrong side. Really? Look at him. You think he is ready to die for this? Stop talking or I turn the shower on. He's weak. When it gets hard, he will run. Like your Oji-san. Grandfather gave us up to protect us. Or maybe he thought you slow him down. You're clean. Don't do this. You are going to die, you know that. Stop protecting a family that never protected you. Join us. Help us find the scroll. We can help you. I can help you. You always play so defensively. And you always over-extend. F14. Doesn't matter... what you do to me, I'm never gonna break. I have not even begun to break you. But when I do, you will beg me to take the scroll from you. Is that so? When does this "breaking" begin? Now. Ahhhhhhh! You guys wanted to know where the Akuma base is? Well, there it is. Is that the library? How did I not think of this? I pulled records going back ten years, all right? And a Japanese company has been buying every bookstore, library and reading room they can get their hands on. It's perfect. They can set up forward operating bases all over the world, right under our noses, and nobody notices because... 'Cause nobody goes to libraries anymore. - Exactly. - Well, how hard can it be to break into a library? This place is crawling with Akuma disguised as employees and customers. Okay, so we wait until night, when they're closed. Yeah, I had that idea too. Look, the place becomes a fortress at night. I mean, almost triple the security. So our best bet is to break in just before they close at 9 pm. When the fewest number of people will be there. Fluke. Lucky. I managed to pull the blueprints and permit history. They have done massive additions to the place, both above and below ground. They added three floors above ground and put in a basement underneath the bottom level, then reinforced it on all sides with military grade steel. So, if they're holding grandfather in the city, it's there. So how do we know what room they're keeping him in? There's no way to know that. Well then, how do we get down there? The blueprints don't say. So we need to break into a public library... - While it's open. - Right, while it's open, without being noticed by the Akuma or the public, we need to go through a door we can't find and don't know how to open, and somehow find this guy in a giant maze... which I'm assuming is infested with Akuma guards... and walk him out of there without anybody noticing? Well, anything sounds bad if you say it like that. I can't watch. Sorry, Mr. Jonesy. Hey, guys, I got something! The Akuma may be good with paper, but they suck ass at cyber security. - Is this the library? - Yeah, main floor. There's about a dozen computers up there, each one with a webcam, I can get you any one. This is excellent work, Mark. Who is that? Yeah, I saw her when I was scouting, too. - Wait, go back. - It's a live feed. What is she doing there? Okay, stop there! What part of "live feed" don't you unders... Just make it stop! That's the leader. It has to be. And that's where the entrance is. Hey, guys, if we can make weapons from paper, maybe we can use paper to make this. To protect you. Oh yeah. Yes, yes! No. No way. That won't work. How is Vincent gonna move in that? Give me a printer and few hours. I can make it work. I got it. So what's going on with you and Wendy? What? Feel like there's a vibe going on. Man, you need to get your vibe-feeling-thing - checked, man. - Come on. Trust me, I'm an expert on girls not being into me. Maybe she likes you but she's too afraid to show it. How would we tell? How does it feel to know you will die tomorrow? - Are you afraid... - You know what? It's late, I'm tired, and I have a headache. Why don't we skip the mind games tonight? Who gave you this? Me. First time I used paper. This is from my first time. An envelope cut me on the way down. Mine was a birthday card. Missed my throw, bounced off the wall, and came back on me. Ouch. Whose birthday was it? Mine. I was eighteen. That was the night they found us. Who found you? Yakuza. My father owed them money. We ran, but they found us. They were hurting him, I had to make them stop. Did you kill them? I didn't know what was happening. It was like a light switch turned on and it was over. And I looked down, and my father... What? Tell me. He was dead. My birthday card was in his throat. I'm sorry. I never told anybody that. Well, I'm probably dead tomorrow anyway, right? Your secret's safe with me "Number one. She plays with her hair." Does she play with her hair around you? She got it caught in the door once. "Number Three. She will often make steady eye contact and suddenly look away." I mean she does the "looking away" part plenty, but not so much the first thing. I will miss this. Uh... you know what? Why don't you just tell me more about that idea. The library closes in half an hour, should be barely anyone in there. Are you ready? 'Cause we need you to get really loud in there. Yeah. Yeah, I think I'm good. - You don't look good. - Yeah, it's just... I don't really get loud, you know? How do I do that? - Just... act like him. - Oh. - What did you say? - Hmm? - Yeah. Thank you. Am I getting some interference? 'Cause there's no way you said what I think you said. Okay, Let's not make a thing about it. I just know you're risking a lot being here and I appreciate it. I've never really had anyone I could depend on before. - Testing... - Agh! Too loud! Ooh! Way too loud! Yes? Can I help you? ♪ Happy birthday ♪ ♪ To a very special you! ♪ - Sir!

No, you chose to avail yourself of my services and now you don't wanna pay for those services. - That's called theft! - I'm gonna have to... Get your hands off me, man! Look, if you lay a hand on me I'll see you in court, you son of a bitch. I'll own this place, you understand? I'll own all y'all motha! Mark, we're heading down now. Well, you know what? Fine. I'm not lugging this damn bear outta here for free any way, I'll tell you that! You can't leave that thing here! Oh yeah? Watch me! You're all living in the past! Okay, Mark, this better work. I can't believe that worked. - We need to hurry. - I know. They're gonna find the other guy upstairs. I said I know! Grandfather! Are you okay? Have they hurt you? What the hell are you doing here? We need to go, right now! Yah! Uh, hi. I-I'm your grandson, Vincent. You're a idiot is what you are. Hey, we came here to rescue you. I don't need to be rescued! You've risked everything by coming here! Is it too late to put him back? Hi! So, listen, I wanna apologize. I lost my temper, there is no excuse. I have anger issues. Um, I'm working on them. Dr. Grady says it's a process. There it is. 'Kay. If you think for one second I'm getting... Oh! I got a couple of associates coming over from the delivery company to help me get that bear outta here, and you will never see us again. All right? Great. Sound good? Let's do it. Good job, dude. How did you come up with that? I had some inspiration. Can I help you with that? Welcome, children. Welcome. Two new Kamijin. So intriguing. I have known many kinds of mutations in kamijin, but yours, I think, is my favorite. The magic in your blood leaves you powerless apart, strong together. It's... sweet. So forgive me if I keep you far away from each other. It will help us as we make your grandfather finally talk. How did you escape? I escaped a long time ago, Wendy. While you slept, I sent a message. Told them I could make you come to us. Then I wrote another message... to help you find us. Hey! Why risk taking you by force If you'll come here of your own free will? We don't have the scroll! Why do you want us? Your grandfather is more resilient than we expected. We needed to find his soft spot. Ungh! Mm! Start with the girl. We could use her. - She's strong. - Now, Sadako. I'm going to ask you ten times. Do you understand me? - Ten times. - Wait a minute. - No! This is too far, come on! - Don't tell them anything! - Give them the damned scroll! - No! It's okay. I'm ready. Where is the scroll? Go to hell. No! I'm sorry. Maybe he's more fond of the boy. No! Don't hurt him! I'm getting impatient. Let's try the whole hand. Where is the scroll? It's at my house. Take me there and I'll show you. You will show us now! - Magic in the blood... - What? - Do it! - Ungh! Ahhh! Ah! Ungh! Leave. I'll handle this. No, absolutely not! You're coming with us. You stay, we all die. Get to the scroll, it's all that matters now. Wendy, we have to go right now! - Anything?! - Nothing! Nothing! They're gonna be here soon! There's no way it's in this house! He has to know the Akuma would check it. Unless it was somewhere they wouldn't look. Do you still have the laptop in the car? You're wasting your time! There's barely anything electrical in this house. Exactly. If you were a Kamijin, and you want to hide something from another Kamijin, where would you put it? Behind the one thing they assume you don't use: technology. There's a hackable network in this house, we just missed it the first time. Like this. What does this do? Traffic lights. I'm telling you, we didn't even have a tape deck! There. What's that? - That's a utility! - Or that's the disguise. Or you're about to kill the power to half the city. That wouldn't be a first for us, actually. What was that? Is the scroll in there? I don't think so, but you guys should come see this. Guys, I think they're coming! The scroll isn't here. Vincent. We have to go. He left us at a fountain, right? Yeah. Is there a park nearby? Um, yeah, there's one up the street, I think. Why? I know where the scroll is. This is the fountain where he left us. And the scroll is here too? No, I would've recognized it. You haven't seen it for like 15 years. This is it. Where he could keep an eye on it. I don't see anything. Guys! No! We may have to fight soon. The water's cold. All right. Fine, fine. There's a panel at the bottom. Hit it! - Ungh! - Hit it again! - It's not gonna work... - Again, Mark! Ungh! Ungh! I never thought I would actually see this. - Run. - What? No. You take it. If we lose, the scroll is theirs. No, you take it. You're a way better fighter than I am. That's why I have to stay. I can buy you more time. No. You're better at being on the run anyway. No, (slice) that, Wendy. I told you, no! It's okay. I don't give a (slice) about some stupid scroll. You have to be the Guardian now. I'm not a Guardian, I'm not even a real Kamijin, - I'm nothing. - You're my brother. Please. I need you to do this for me. Remember that first day we met at the house? You mean the day I kicked your ass? I let you win. Sure you did. Best day of my life. Come on! I tried to save you. Who's going to save you? That blood will wear off. Don't make me kill you. Ungh! What will you do now, little girl? What my brother would do... make it up as I go. Ahhhh! Ahhh! How disappointing. Stop! No... Vincent! What are you doing? I'm not losing my whole family over this stupid thing. Take it! Just leave us alone! This can't be the scroll. It's blank. - No, it can't... - Unless... You read the scroll! I may have taken a peek. The words vanished as I read them. And I don't understand Japanese, but I think it said something about... power overwhelming. What have you done? - Wendy... - Get away from me. Wendy, I had no choice! Wendy! Hey, man, whatcha watchin'? I don't know. Some house flipping thing. Wanna watch something? Nah, I got busy day today. What you got? Show-off. I got Orientation, Economics 101, Japanese class, and training. I still can't picture you going to community college, man. I didn't write the old man's will. Hey, watch this. Didn't you need that? Uh, yeah, actually. That was dumb. Maybe I can put it back together. Having fun? Wendy! Are you okay? I've been trying to call you for weeks. I'm fine. Listen, I know this isn't what you wanted. What's done is done. But you can't keep this power, it's too much for anyone. You know that, right? So we have to undo it, and I think I know how. Great. How? Just... um, don't freak out, all right? Why would we freak out? - Whoa! - It's okay, it's okay. - She's with me! - She's with you? Why are you here? We want the same thing now. I find that very hard to believe. I will explain later. We have a car waiting outside, let's go. Where are we going? To Japan.
