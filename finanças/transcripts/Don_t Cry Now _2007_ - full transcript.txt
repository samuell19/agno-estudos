(Heartbeat) (CAPTAIN KESSLER) SO HOW DID YOU KNOW HER, MRS. WHEELER? (BONNIE) I'M MARRIED TO JOAN'S EX-HUSBAND...ROSS WHEELER. (CAPTAIN KESSLER) THAT NAME SOUNDS FAMILIAR. (BONNIE) HE CO-HOSTS THE EVENING NEWS WITH MARLA BRINZELLE... ON CHANNEL EIGHT. (CAPTAIN KESSLER) OF COURSE. WHERE'S YOUR HUSBAND NOW? (BONNIE) HE SHOULD BE HERE SOON. YOU WERE FRIENDS WITH HIS EX-WIFE? NOT EXACTLY, NO. YOU'RE IN HER HOUSE? SHE CALLED ME AND I THOUGHT THAT... I DON'T KNOW WHAT I THOUGHT. DID SHE CALL YOU OFTEN? NO...JUST SOMETIMES WHEN SHE DRANK. SO JOAN CALLED AND YOU CAME RUNNING? (BONNIE) (Protests) NO! SHE SAID THAT MY DAUGHTER AND I WERE IN DANGER. HOW SO? SHE DIDN'T SAY... THAT'S WHY I'M HERE. LAUREN? YOU HAVE A BROTHER, RIGHT? SAM. DO YOU KNOW WHERE HE IS? (♪) (DIANA) ARE YOU OKAY? (BONNIE) WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? I CALLED YOU AN HOUR AGO. (DIANA) I CAME AS SOON AS I GOT YOUR MESSAGE. BONNIE, I'M A CORPORATE LAWYER. THIS IS TOTALLY OUT OF MY LEAGUE. I DIDN'T KNOW WHO ELSE TO CALL, DIANA. WHERE'S ROSS? I DON'T KNOW. I LEFT HALF-A-DOZEN MESSAGES ON HIS CELL PHONE. I WANNA GO HOME. (ROSS) MARLA, THIS ISN'T A STORY. (MARLA) BY 6:00 IT WILL BE. (♪) (♪) (MARLA) ROSS. (ROSS) SAM! (SAM) LONG TIME NO SEE. HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN OUT HERE? (SAM) DAD...WHAT'S GOING ON? THEY JUST TOOK A BODY AWAY. IT'S MOM, ISN'T IT? YEAH. DING DONG THE WITCH IS DEAD. WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT? (ROSS) HEY...POOR THING! LET'S GET YOU OUT OF HERE. (BONNIE) WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? I CAME AS SOON AS I HEARD. IT WAS HORRIBLE. I KNOW; I'M HERE NOW. POOR JOAN...SHE WAS DEAD WHEN I GOT HERE. IT'S OKAY...JUST TRY NOT TO THINK ABOUT IT. WHY DO YOU THINK JOAN? (LAUREN) DADDY! (ROSS) LAUREN.

I THINK MY CHILDREN HAVE BEEN THROUGH ENOUGH FOR ONE DAY. (SAM) I'M FINE. REALLY, I DON'T MIND. (CAPTAIN KESSLER) YOUR FATHER DOES. (CAPTAIN KESSLER) YOU HAVE A FAN, MRS. WHEELER. (BONNIE) OH MY GOD. (ROSS) WHY WOULD SHE DO THIS? (CAPTAIN KESSLER) IS THAT YOU? (BONNIE) YEAH. THAT'S... MY BROTHER NICK. (CAPTAIN KESSLER) YOUR MAIDEN NAME'S LONERGAN? (BONNIE) THAT'S RIGHT. I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM SINCE HE WENT TO PRISON. (BONNIE) THIS MUST HAVE BEEN TAKEN SOMETIME LAST WEEK... I JUST BOUGHT AMANDA THAT COAT. (DIANA) I'M SO SORRY. (CAPTAIN KESSLER) DID YOUR BROTHER KNOW JOAN? NOT THAT I'M AWARE OF, NO. (CAPTAIN KESSLER) HIS PHONE NUMBER'S IN HER ADDRESS BOOK. (CAPTAIN KESSLER) JOSH FREEMAN? DOES THAT NAME RING A BELL? (BONNIE) NO. (CAPTAIN KESSLER) SAM, DID YOUR MOTHER OWN A HANDGUN? (ROSS) OF COURSE NOT! (SAM) ACTUALLY, YEAH...A .357. IT WAS MY DAD'S. IT SHOULD BE IN THAT DRAWER YOU WERE POKIN' THROUGH. (CAPTAIN KESSLER) NO GUN. (CAPTAIN KESSLER) WHERE'S YOUR GUN MR. WHEELER? (ROSS) WHY DON'T YOU ASK MY ATTORNEY? COME ON. (BONNIE) ROSS, WE CAN'T JUST LEAVE... SURE WE CAN...SAM? SAM, NOW! YOU THINK MY DAD KILLED HER? DO YOU? (BONNIE) I CAN'T BELIEVE HE BROUGHT MARLA WITH HIM. SHE'S HITTING ON THE COPS! SHE CAN WRITE? APPARENTLY. (DIANA) IT'S A SNAKE! (BONNIE) I CAN SEE THAT. (BONNIE) AMANDA, THIS IS SAM'S ROOM NOW. (AMANDA) I KNOW. LOOK MOM... IT ATE A MOUSE. (BONNIE) HMMM. HE CAN'T HEAR BUT HE FEELS THE VIBRATIONS. (BONNIE) THE SNAKE'S ALMOST AS BIG AS YOU ARE, HONEY. YEAH, HE'S PRETTY BIG. SEE THE BUMP? IS THAT THE MOUSE? SAM SAYS IT COULD TAKE A WEEK TO DIGEST. POOR LITTLE MOUSE. (ROSS) YOU GUYS MUST BE HUNGRY, HUH ? (LAUREN) NOT REALLY. (ROSS) NO? WANT SOME OF THAT, HUN ? (AMANDA) NO, THANK YOU. (ROSS) OH NO, AMANDA...LOOK...! (AMANDA) SORRY DADDY. (ROSS) BONNIE, CAN YOU PLEASE... (BONNIE) TAKE THIS ONE TOO. (ROSS) AMANDA, PLEASE TRY AND BE MORE CAREFUL...PLEASE. (AMANDA) SORRY MOM...I DIDN'T MEAN TOO. (BONNIE) IT'S ALRIGHT HONEY... THERE YOU GO. (ROSS) I THINK SHE'S HAD ENOUGH MILK...FOR ONE NIGHT. (AMANDA) CAN I SIT WITH SAM AT THE FUNERAL? (ROSS) HONEY, PLEASE...NOT NOW. (SAM) SHE CAN IF SHE WANTS. ARE YOU SAD? NOTHING BOTHERS SAM. THIS IS KIND OF LIKE OLD TIMES. (ROSS) YEAH, IT IS. (SAM) YOU'RE WRONG. THINGS BOTHER ME. (AMANDA) DADDY, DO YOU LOVE SAM AND LAUREN AS MUCH AS YOU LOVE ME? (ROSS) OF COURSE I DO. (AMANDA) YOU NEVER WENT TO VISIT THEM. (ROSS) UHH...UMM... (LAUREN) IT'S NOT HIS FAULT. MY MOM WOULDN'T LET HIM. THAT'S MEAN. ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT ANY OTHER FOOD, HONEY? NO. (AMANDA) WHY WOULDN'T SHE? (SAM) BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T LOVE HIM ANYMORE. I TRIED. SHE NEEDED YOUR HELP AND YOU WEREN'T THERE. (LAUREN) SHUT UP SAM, BEFORE YOU RUIN EVERYTHING. (ROSS) NO, I'D LIKE TO HEAR WHAT HE HAS TO SAY. (SAM) NO, IT DOESN'T MATTER. (Ross Clears His Throat) I KNOW THIS IS HARD, BUT WE'RE A FAMILY NOW AND WE'RE GOING TO GET THROUGH THIS...ALL OF US...TOGETHER. I GOT A SISTER AND A BROTHER NOW. (AMANDA) CAN YOU READ THIS, MOMMY? HUH...IT SAYS OTHERS RECOGNIZE YOUR SWEET NATURE. MAY I BE EXCUSED? (BONNIE) OKAY... (ROSS) WHAT'S WRONG? WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME YOU OWNED A GUN? I FORGOT. HOW DO YOU FORGET A GUN, ROSS? COME ON, BONNIE... GIVE ME A BREAK... IT'S BEEN ALMOST TEN YEARS. IT WAS JOAN'S IDEA. I DIDN'T WANT ONE INSIDE THE HOUSE BUT SHE INSISTED. JOAN ALWAYS GOT HER WAY; YOU KNOW THAT. LAST TIME I SAW IT, I THINK IT WAS IN A BOX IN THE BASEMENT. I WOULD NEVER BRING A GUN INSIDE THIS HOUSE. WHY WOULD ANYONE WANT TO KILL JOAN? IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. DID SHE SAY ANYTHING? SHE MUST HAVE SAID SOMETHING. (BONNIE) SHE WANTED ME TO MEET HER. SHE SAID THAT AMANDA AND I WERE IN DANGER; SHE WAS SCARED. IN DANGER FROM WHO? (BONNIE) I DON'T KNOW. I CAN'T HELP THINKING THAT WHOEVER KILLED JOAN IS AFTER AMANDA AND ME. DON'T BE SILLY! (BONNIE) THAT'S NOT SILLY. JOAN WAS TRYING TO WARN ME AND NOW SHE'S DEAD. YOU DIDN'T HEAR HER VOICE ROSS, I DID. I SHOULD HAVE BELIEVED HER. SHE'S KILLED WITH HER OWN GUN... THE ONE THAT'S SUPPOSED TO PROTECT HER. (ROSS) WE DON'T KNOW THAT. WELL, THAT'S WHAT THAT COP, KESSLER, THINKS. (BONNIE) I'M JUST SCARED AND THE KIDS ARE TOO. SAM HATES ME. I THINK HATE'S A STRONG WORD. I DON'T BLAME HIM. I HAVEN'T BEEN MUCH OF A FATHER. HE JUST DOESN'T KNOW YOU. GIVE HIM TIME. AND LAUREN'S SO DIFFERENT, SHE SO MUCH STRONGER THAN SAM. I DON'T KNOW...I'M WORRIED ABOUT THEM. WELL THEY SEEM TO HAVE TAKEN TO AMANDA. I THINK IT'S JUST A QUESTION OF TIME. THEY'RE OUR KIDS NOW, HUH ? SAM WILL COME AROUND...YOU'LL SEE. DON'T HOLD YOUR BREATH. HE'S GOT MY STUBBORN STREAK. ROSS, THERE WAS A PICTURE ON JOAN'S DRESSER AND SAM SAID IT WAS SUZIE. I KNOW YOU DON'T LIKE TO TALK ABOUT IT, BUT... I WAS AT WORK...SAM WAS EIGHT, ALMOST NINE. I REMEMBER THAT BECAUSE SHE DROWNED TWO DAYS BEFORE HIS BIRTHDAY. IT WAS SIX INCHES OF WATER IN THAT TUB, CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT? JOAN WENT INTO SHOCK...IT WAS SAM WHO CALLED TO TELL ME. THE POOR BOY. THOSE KIDS HAVE BEEN THROUGH SO MUCH. (♪) (♪) (Knocks) (SAM) COME IN. HI. WELL, I GUESS I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO SMOKE, HUH ? UH...WELL NO...I'D RATHER YOU DIDN'T. I GUESS I COULD MAKE AN EXCEPTION FOR ONE NIGHT, THOUGH. (SAM) WHATEVER. YOU KNOW HE WON'T HURT YOU. UH HUH ...PRETTY DAMN BIG, SAM. YEAH, HE'S ONLY SIX FEET. HE'LL GROW TO BE TWELVE... EVEN BIGGER IN THE WILD. (BONNIE) OH, OKAY...THAT'S ENOUGH...DON'T PLEASE. WHAT, HE'S NOT SLIMY. I'LL TAKE YOUR WORD FOR IT. YOU KNOW, PEOPLE ARE AFRAID OF THINGS THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND. UH HUH ... WOULD YOU LIKE TO HOLD HIM? I'LL TRY. (SAM) PUT OUT YOUR HANDS. (SAM) DON'T BE SCARED. (BONNIE) AHH! HE'S HEAVY. (SAM) YEAH, DON'T DROP HIM; HE HATES TO BE DROPPED. UH HUH...! OKAY, THAT'S ENOUGH...TAKE HIM, PLEASE. (BONNIE) (Nervous) OKAY... YOU KNOW, MY MOM LIKED YOU. I'M SORRY I DIDN'T GET TO KNOW HER BETTER. (SAM) EASIER SAID THAN DONE. MY DAD HATES ME...DOESN'T HE? NO, ROSS LOVES YOU VERY MUCH. NAH ...LAUREN'S HIS FAVORITE...SHE ALWAYS WAS. GIVE YOUR DAD A CHANCE SAM. I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO. SAM? YOUR MOTHER SAID THAT I WAS IN DANGER. DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT? IS THAT WHY SHE PHONED YOU? AM I IN DANGER? HOW WOULD I KNOW? WHY WOULD SOMEONE KILL MY MOM? (BONNIE) OKAY...GOOD-NIGHT. (♪) (PRIEST) THE LORD IS MY SHEPHERD... I SHALL NOT BE AND WANT. HE MAKES ME LIE DOWN IN GREEN PASTURES. HE LEADS ME BESIDE QUIET WATERS. HE RESTORES MY SOUL. HE GUIDES ME IN THE PATHS OF RIGHTOUSNESS FOR HIS NAMES SAKE. EVEN THOUGH I WALK THROUGH THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW OF DEATH, I WILL FEAR NO EVIL. IF YOU ARE WITH ME, YOUR CROSS AND YOUR STAFF MAY COMFORT ME. YOU PREPARE A TABLE BEFORE ME IN THE PRESENCE OF MY ENEMIES. YOU ANNOINT MY HEAD WITH OIL. MY CUP OVERFLOWS. SURELY GOODNESS AND LOVE WILL FOLLOW ME ALL THE DAYS OF MY LIFE AND I WILL DWELL IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD FOREVER. (PRIEST) FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO KNEW JOAN WELL, WERE AWARE HER LIFE WAS A DIFFICULT ONE. SHE STRUGGLED WITH HER FEARS AND DEMONS AS INDEED WE ALL DO. SHE STRIVED TO BE A GOOD MOTHER AND A GOOD FRIEND. JOAN'S DEATH WAS A TERRIBLE TRAGEDY. IT WAS SUDDEN, QUICK AND VERY UNEXPECTED. TO YOU, HER FAMILY, AND INDEED ALL HER FRIENDS, TAKE SOLICE IN THE KNOWLEDGE THAT JOAN IS AT PEACE...AND WALKS WITH OUR SAVIOR. (♪) (♪) (JOSH) IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT. YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT. (SAM) SHE WAS DRINKING ALL WEEK. IT ALWAYS SCARED ME WHEN SHE GOT LIKE THAT. (BONNIE) HOW ARE YOU DOING SWEETHEART; ARE YOU OKAY? IT'S COLD. ARE YOU WARM ENOUGH, HONEY? YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THAT COP'S FACE WHEN HE WENT IN HER ROOM... PICKING HIS WAY THROUGH ALL HER GARBAGE. WHO'S THAT WITH SAM? (LAUREN) MR. FREEMAN; SAMS ART TEACHER. HE'S BEEN TO OUR HOUSE A FEW TIMES. JOSH FREEMAN? SOMETHING LIKE THAT. MY MOM LIKED HIM. (JOSH) IT'S OVER. (SAM) NO...IT'S NOT OVER YET. (SAM) YOU DIDN'T CRY. (LAUREN) NEITHER DID YOU. NICK! SAM, WHERE'S YOUR FATHER? I DON'T KNOW. HE WAS HERE A SECOND AGO. (ROSS) IT'S QUITE A CROWD. SEEMS SHE HAD A LOT OF FRIENDS. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? (CAPTAIN KESSLER) LOOKING FOR ANSWERS. (ROSS) THIS HARDLY SEEMS LIKE THE TIME OR THE PLACE. (CAPTAIN KESSLER) THE BEREAVED EX-HISBAND. NO TEARS? I USED THEM ALL UP IN MY DIVORCE. WHAT DO YOU WANT? YOU OWN JOAN'S HOUSE NOW THAT SHE'S DEAD. I OWNED HALF OF IT WHEN WE WERE MARRIED...WHAT'S YOUR POINT? NO POINT. I DIDN'T KILL JOAN, IF THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE GOING FOR. I HAD NO REASON. REALLY? YOU HAVE A HALF A MILLION DOLLAR LIFE INSURANCE POLICY ON YOUR EX-WIFE. OR HAD YOU FORGOTTEN? I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS. THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE WRONG, MR. WHEELER... IT'S ALL MY BUSINESS. IT'S A LOT, WOULDN'T YOU SAY...HAVING A LIFE INSURANCE POLICY ON YOUR EX? IT PAYS DOUBLE INDEMNITY IN CASE OF ACCIDENTAL DEATH OR MURDER. THAT'S A COOL MILLION, MR. WHEELER. WHAT DO YOU THINK THE HOUSE IS WORTH? I'M SURE YOU ALREADY KNOW. YOU'RE PREDICTABLE KESSLER. THE HUSBAND'S ALWAYS THE PRIME SUSPECT. ONLY WHEN HE DOESN'T HAVE AN ALIBI. WHERE WERE YOU THAT DAY, MR. WHEELER? OR DON'T YOU WANT YOUR WIFE TO KNOW THE TRUTH. I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING MORE TO SAY TO YOU. (CAPTAIN KESSLER) MR. WHEELER? SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS. (♪) (Birds Chirping) (♪) (♪) (Knocking) (STEVE) BONNIE? HI POP. COME IN, COME IN. YOUR HAIR'S DIFFERENT. WELL, EVERYTHING HERE LOOKS THE SAME. YEAH...PRETTY MUCH. HOW'S ROSS? FINE. HE'S FINE. YEAH, I SEE HIM ON THE TELEVISION. I HEAR YOU HAD A BABY. AMANDA. SHE'S SIX NOW POP. I SURE WOULD LIKE TO MEET HER. I'M NOT HERE FOR A REUNION, POP. (BONNIE) IT'S NOT ABOUT YOU AND ME. (STEVE) I SEE. I'M LOOKING FOR NICK. I KNOW HE'S OUT AND I THINK HE'S HERE...IS HE? HE'S DOING REAL GOOD, BONNIE. (STEVE) HE'S GOT A PART-TIME JOB AT WAGNER ELECTRIC. (STEVE) LYLE'S KID...HE'S GOT THE SHOP NOW. HE SHOULD BE HOME BY ANY MINUTE. YOU CAN TALK TO HIM THEN. (BONNIE) OKAY. MAYBE THE THREE OF US CAN HAVE SUPPER TOGETHER. I CAN'T DO THAT. (BONNIE) SORRY. THIS IS ABOUT THAT NOSY COP, ISN'T IT? (STEVE) KESSLER. SO THEN YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. (STEVE) YEAH, I SAW IT ON THE NEWS...EVERYONE KNOWS. NOW, YOU DON'T THINK YOUR BROTHER HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THAT WOMAN'S DEATH, DO YA? HE'S A GOOD BOY. WHAT DID YOU TELL KESSLER, POP? (STEVE) THE TRUTH. NICK WAS WITH ME THAT DAY...ALL DAY. HE WOULDN'T HURT A FLY. YOU GOTTA HAVE MORE FAITH IN YOUR BROTHER, BONNIE. HE REALLY LOOKED UP TO YOU. (The Back Door Slams Shut) (NICK) HEY POP...I'M HOME! IS THERE ANYTHING TO EAT? (NICK) WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU? YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'VE SEEN A GHOST. AND SO YOU HAVE. BONNIE. HI NICK. DID YOU COME HOME TO SEE HOW THE OTHER HALF LIVES? I NEED TO TALK TO YOU. SURE. I GUESS WE'LL BE OUT BACK. (♪) (♪) (BONNIE) IS THAT YOURS? (NICK) MIGHT BE. PRETTY NICE FOR AN APPRENTICE ELECTRICIAN FRESH OUT OF JAIL. ELECTRICIAN? IS THAT WHAT POP TOLD YOU? WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME THE TRUTH NICK...FOR ONCE? STILL ANGRY AFTER ALL THESE YEARS. (NICK) I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU HAVEN'T BROUGHT YOUR LITTLE GIRL BY TO MEET POP. YOU LIVE WHAT... TEN MILES FROM HERE? THE OLD BOY AIN'T GONNA LIVE FOREVER. I'M SURE HE'D LOVE TO MEET HIS ONLY GRANDDAUGHTER. DON'T TURN THIS AROUND. YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT WHY I'M HERE. WELL I THOUGHT MAYBE IT WAS TO PATCH UP THE PAST. APPARENTLY I WAS WRONG. WHY WAS YOUR NAME IN JOAN WHEELER'S ADDRESS BOOK? WHO SAYS IT WAS? HOW DO YOU KNOW HER NICK? I DIDN'T. I SAW YOU AT THE FUNERAL. NOW, WHAT WERE YOU DOING THERE IF YOU DIDN'T KNOW HER? YEAH, I WAS THERE. SO WHAT? I DIDN'T KILL HER! IF THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE THINKING. YOU DID THREE YEARS FOR CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT MURDER. IT'S NOT EXACTLY OUT OF LEFT FIELD, NICK! I GOT CAUGHT UP WITH SOME DOPERS TRYING TO MAKE SOME FAST CASH. I SCREWED UP, OKAY? (NICK) I SURE AS HELL DIDN'T TRY TO KILL ANYONE. I JUST GOT TARRED WITH THE SAME BRUSH IS ALL. BESIDES, WHAT WOULD I POSSIBLY HAVE TO GAIN BY KILLING ROSS'S EX-WIFE? I DON'T KNOW. (BONNIE) I JUST DON'T KNOW. BUT I WANT YOU TO STAY AWAY FROM ME AND MY FAMILY, DO YOU HEAR ME? LITTLE AMANDA DOESN'T WANT TO MEET HER UNCLE NICK? (BONNIE) JUST STAY AWAY! (NICK) YOU KNOW, I HAVE AN ALIBI. (BONNIE) POP IS HARDLY AN ALIBI. HE'D DO ANYTHING TO KEEP YOU OUT OF TROUBLE, NICK. HE LOVES YOU. YOU MAKE IT SOUND LIKE A DIRTY WORD. (BONNIE) YOU'RE ON PAROLE. YOU WATCH YOUR STEP OR I'LL TURN YOU IN MYSELF IF I HAVE TO. DON'T THINK I WON'T. (NICK) COME ON BONNIE, I'M STILL YOUR BROTHER. YOU'RE TROUBLE AND YOU ALWAYS WERE. I THINK YOU'RE JUST PISSED BECAUSE MOM LEFT ME THE HOUSE. IF MOM KNEW THAT POP WAS GOING TO MOVE BACK IN, I THINK SHE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT TWICE ABOUT LEAVING YOU THE HOUSE. WELL, I GUESS LUCKY FOR HIM SHE'S DEAD. (SCHOOL TEACHER) OKAY CHILDREN, STAY TOGETHER. WATCH OUT, IT'S ICY. (♪) (SCHOOL TEACHER) BE CAREFUL...IT'S ICY ON THE BRIDGE. (♪) (♪) (Slight Noise) (AMANDA) (Laughs) HEY! (♪) (AMANDA) WHERE DID YOU GO? (SCHOOL TEACHER) OKAY KIDS, STICK TOGETHER. WE'RE HEADING TO THE BUS NOW. (BONNIE) HI. (CHILD) MOMMY! (BONNIE) AMANDA? (BONNIE) AMANDA?! (BONNIE) AMANDA!

(Eerie Music) (BONNIE) BE CAREFUL, THE BRIDGE IS SLIPPERY. (BONNIE) BE CAREFUL...THERE'S A BIG STEP DOWN THERE, ALRIGHT? (BONNIE) IT'S OKAY, HONEY, I'M GOING TO GET YOU ANOTHER PANDA BEAR JUST LIKE THIS ONE. (AMANDA) NO! HONEY, I'M GOING TO GET YOU ANOTHER ONE EXACTLY LIKE THIS. (AMANDA) NO... (BONNIE) KESSLER! (CAPTAIN KESSLER) WHAT HAPPENED? (AMANDA) I GOT LOST. (BONNIE) SHE WAS LURED OFF THE PATH WITH THIS...IT'S HER FAVORITE STUFFED ANIMAL. WE FOUND IT STABBED TO A TREE WITH THIS. (CAPTAIN KESSLER) YOU SHOULD HAVE LEFT IT WHERE IT WAS. (BONNIE) I WASN'T THINKING AND SHE WOULDN'T LEAVE THE WOODS WITHOUT HER BEAR. (CAPTAIN KESSLER) AMANDA? CAN I SEE YOUR LITTLE PANDA BEAR? (AMANDA) NO, HE'S HURT. (CAPTAIN KESSLER) WHO HAD YOUR BEAR, AMANDA? WAS IT A BOY...A GIRL? (AMANDA) I DON'T KNOW. (CAPTAIN KESSLER) ARE YOU SURE IT'S HERS? THERE MUST BE HUNDREDS LIKE IT. (BONNIE) HONEY. SIT HERE FOR A MINUTE... I'LL BE RIGHT BACK, OKAY? (BONNIE) HER NAME IS WRITTEN ON THE TAG. IT'S HER FAVORITE STUFFED ANIMAL. SHE LEFT IT ON THE SEAT OF THE BUS. WHOEVER TOOK IT KNEW IT WAS HERS. JOAN SAID SHE WAS IN DANGER. DOESN'T THIS PROVE IT? WAS ANYONE SEEN? (BONNIE) NO...THE BUS DRIVER LEFT THE DOOR OPEN WHEN HE WENT TO USE THE WASHROOM. I'LL HAVE THE KNIFE CHECKED FOR PRINTS. IT'S PROBABLY BEEN WIPED CLEAN, THOUGH. I WASN'T THINKING. IT'S ALRIGHT; YOU WERE WORRIED ABOUT YOUR DAUGHTER. (CAPTAIN KESSLER) IF IT MAKES YOU FEEL BETTER, I'LL HAVE A CAR WATCH AMANDA'S SCHOOL FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS. I'D APPRECIATE THAT. (BONNIE) OKAY, HONEY...WE'RE GOING TO GO HOME NOW. (ROSS)(On TV) THE HUSKIES WILL HIT THE ICE AT WILSON ARENA THIS WEEKEND. TOMORROW NIGHT'S GAME STARTS AT 6:00PM; THE FIRST OF TWO HOME GAMES AND I UNDERSTAND THAT TICKETS ARE STILL AVAILABLE. (MARLA) DON'T LET THE WEATHER KEEP YOU HOME. I'LL BE THERE CHEERING ON THE HUSKIES. (AMANDA) DADDY HASN'T PULLED HIS EAR YET! (SAM) WHAT? DADDY SAID HE'D PULL HIS EAR TO SAY HI TO ME. (ROSS) I'M ROSS WHEELER. (MARLA) AND I'M MARLA BRINZELLE. THANKS FOR JOINING US. (ROSS) WE'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW...TAKE CARE. SEE, I TOLD YOU. (ROSS) THE OTHER DAY SHE ASKED ME HOW LONG WERE THEY STAYING. YOU'RE A GOOD MAN, ROSS. (MARLA) OH...! (ROSS) WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? (MARLA) HI BONNIE...I WAS JUST... TUGGING ON MY HUSBANDS EAR? (MARLA) SORRY. HEY! (BONNIE) HI. WHAT'S WRONG? SHE'S FLIRTING WITH YOU. ARE YOU JEALOUS? I DON'T KNOW, ROSS...SHOULD I BE? (MAN) HOUSE LIGHTS, PLEASE... HOUSE LIGHTS. GOODNIGHT, PEOPLE. (SAM) YOUR BROTHER'S HERE. (BONNIE) I KNOW...I SAW HIS CAR...WHAT DOES HE WANT? (SAM) I DON'T KNOW BUT HE'S MAKING DINNER. (BONNIE) OH, PERFECT! (NICK) YOU KNOW, YOU COULD BE A MODEL. (LAUREN) DO YOU THINK? (NICK) A PRETTY GIRL LIKE YOU? ABSOLUTELY! (LAUREN) I'D RATHER BE A TV REPORTER LIKE MARLA BRINZELLE. (BONNIE) MARLA READS THE NEWS LAUREN. THAT'S NOT EVEN CLOSE TO BEING A REPORTER. HI NICK, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? LOOKING FOR A SECOND CHANCE. OUT! NOW! HE'S MAKING HIS FAMOUS SPAGHETTI SAUCE. WHY CAN'T HE STAY? BECAUSE HE HAS SOMEWHERE ELSE TO BE...DON'T YOU NICK? OH COME ON...JUST HAVE ONE LITTLE TASTE AND THEN I'LL GO. (NICK) SERIOUSLY, JUST OPEN UP...OPEN UP THE CAVE AND THE LITTLE TRUCK WILL JUST DRIVE STRAIGHT IN. (NICK) ALRIGHT, AMANDA...HERE YOU GO...JUST FOR YOU... SUPER SPECIAL. (AMANDA) THANK YOU. (NICK) GO TO YOUR CHAIR. (NICK) ALRIGHT, BIG GUY, HOW MUCH FOR YOU? (SAM) UH ...JUST LOAD IT UP. (DIANA) I DUG UP A LITTLE INFORMATION ON SAM'S ART TEACHER, JOSH FREEMAN. (BONNIE) DO I REALLY WANT TO KNOW THIS? I DON'T SLEEP WELL ENOUGH AS IT IS. I DID WHAT YOU ASKED. OKAY. APPARENTLY, IT'S BEEN ALMOST THREE YEARS SINCE HIS LAST TEACHING ASSIGNMENT. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? USE YOUR IMAGINATION. A THREE YEAR HIATUS? THAT CAN'T BE GOOD. SOMETHING KEPT HIM OUT OF THE CLASSROOM. (BONNIE) THE SCHOOL BOARD WOULDN'T HIRE... (DIANA) I THINK IT'S TIME YOU HAD A LITTLE CHAT WITH YOUR STEPSON. (DIANA) ANGRY MUSIC, ANGRY CLOTHES, ANGRY BOY. HE'S GOT ROSS'S EYES. I'VE NOTICED THAT. (LAUREN) IS IT TRUE YOU WERE IN JAIL? (NICK) WELL, I'LL PUT IT TO YOU THIS WAY, KID; I'VE BEEN IN SOME SCARY PLACES THAT I WISH I WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN BUT, DON'T BELIEVE EVERYTHING YOU READ IN THE PAPERS... OR HEAR FROM OTHERS, ESPECIALLY MY SISTER. THINGS AREN'T ALWAYS AS THEY APPEAR, ARE THEY BONNIE? OH COME ON; DO US A FAVOR AND GIVE US A SMILE. (NICK) THIS IS A SPECIAL OCCASION AFTER ALL; IT'S A FAMILY REUNION. NICK, I'D APPRECIATE IT IF YOU KEPT YOUR CONVERSATION TO A MINIMUM. MY NIECE ASKED ME A QUESTION. I WAS JUST BEING A GOOD UNCLE; IS THAT WRONG? IF YOUR LOOKING FOR A ROLE MODEL, YOU CAN DO BETTER THAN YOUR UNCLE NICK AND IF YOU NEED SOME ADVISE, YOU CAN ASK YOUR FATHER OR ME. (SAM) IF HE EVER COMES HOME... (DIANA) NOT HUNGRY? (SAM) NO, NOT REALLY. HOW ARE YOU AT FIXING THINGS? LIKE WHAT? I WAS THINKIN' OF WALLPAPERING MY SPARE BEDROOM. (DIANA) THINK YOU CAN DO THAT FOR ME? (SAM) MMMM HMMM. I COULD USE SOMEBODY WHO'S GOOD WITH HIS HANDS. (DIANA) ARE YOU OR AREN'T YOU? UH...YEAH... SURE, I CAN TRY. CAN I HELP? (SAM) SHE DIDN'T ASK YOU! IT'S ALRIGHT... IT'S A BIG JOB. YOU BOTH CAN PITCH IN. (MARLA) DO YOU THINK THOSE NEW PROMOS WILL HELP OUR RATINGS? I REALLY DON'T SEE THE POINT SOMETIMES. (ROSS) THEY CAN'T HURT. (MARLA) I SAW MY FACE ON THE BILLBOARD TODAY. ROSS? IS MY SMILE TOO BIG FOR TELEVISION? (Ross Laughs) WHAT, ARE YOU KIDDING ME? YOU'RE SMILE IS PERFECT. (ROSS) DON'T CHANGE A THING. (NICK) YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE A DISHWASHER. (BONNIE) THEY WON'T COME CLEAN IF I DON'T WASH THEM FIRST. (NICK) NOW THAT'S LOGIC. NICK, I APPRECIATE YOU COOKING DINNER, BUT THE TRUTH IS...YOU SCARE ME. YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT? YOUR BEST FRIEND IS IN THERE HITTING ON YOUR STEPSON AND I SCARE YOU? WHY NOW? WHY THE SUDDEN INTEREST IN PATCHING THINGS UP? NICK, I NEED TO ASK YOU WHERE YOU WERE THIS AFTERNOON. COME ON BONNIE; SCARING LITTLE KIDS AIN'T EXACTLY MY STYLE. (DIANA) I'M HEADING HOME. GIVE MY LOVE TO ROSS. (BONNIE) I WILL AND THANKS FOR COMING OUT. (NICK) AND THANKS FOR HELPING WITH THE DISHES. DID YOU KISS SAM GOOD-NIGHT? (DIANA) YOUR CHARM'S WEARING THIN NICK. GOOD NIGHT, BONNIE. NICK. (Nick Laughs) YOU HAVE TO GO NOW TOO. (BONNIE) GOODNIGHT, NICK. ALRIGHT. (♪) (Knock) (LAUREN) I DON'T FEEL SO GOOD. (BONNIE) ROSS. (BONNIE) OH...OKAY...THAT'S BETTER NOW, HUH ? MAYBE IT'S THE FLU. MAYBE NICK'S SPAGHETTI SAUCE. (BONNIE) YOU THINK MAYBE IF I MADE YOU SOME TEA, YOU COULD KEEP IT DOWN? (Lauren Gets Sick) CAN YOU ASK MY DAD IF HE'LL STAY WITH ME UNTIL I FALL ASLEEP? (BONNIE) SURE. (School Bell Rings) HI BONNIE. (BONNIE) HI. HOW WAS IT TODAY? PEOPLE ASK THE STUPIDEST QUESTIONS. THEY'RE JUST CURIOUS. THEY'RE MORBID. SO, HAVE YOU SEEN SAM? (LAUREN) I THINK HE CUT...I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM SINCE LUNCH. I THOUGHT MY DAD WAS SUPPOSED TO PICK US UP. WELL, HE GOT STUCK AT THE STUDIO. HE'S ALWAYS THERE... DO YOU MIND IF I GO OVER TO MY FRIEND CRYSTAL'S HOUSE? NO, I DON'T THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA. YOU'VE BEEN SICK, LAUREN. WHAT I NEED IS SOME FRESH AIR. OKAY. THANK'S. (BONNIE) UH ...DO YOUR COAT UP! (♪) (♪) DO YOU ALWAYS MEET SECRETLY WITH YOUR STUDENTS? EXCUSE ME? I'M SAM'S STEPMOTHER, BONNIE WHEELER. NO, I KNOW WHO YOU ARE. I SAW YOU AT THE FUNERAL. CAN WE TALK? DO I HAVE A CHOICE? SO, WHY AM I SO INTERESTING? YOUR NAME WAS IN JOAN'S ADDRESS BOOK. I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU A FEW QUESTIONS. YOU SOUND LIKE KESSLER. (BONNIE) HOW CLOSE WERE YOU AND JOAN? WELL, WE WEREN'T INTIMATE, IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WERE THINKING. JOAN AND I WERE... KINDRED SPIRITS. SHE LOST A CHILD. I LOST A WIFE AND SON IN A CAR ACCIDENT. (JOSH) A DRUNK DRIVER. JOAN UNDERSTOOD THE...EMPTINESS. I DIDN'T WORK. I DIDN'T WANT TO LIVE. AS FAR AS MY RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR STEPSON... MY SON'S DEAD, SAM'S NOT. SAM HAS A FATHER. HE DOES? (BONNIE) THAT'S NOT FAIR. YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW ROSS. DO YOU? ROSS DID HIS BEST FOR JOAN AND HIS KIDS. SHE WAS A VERY DIFFICULT WOMAN. YOU KNOW THAT... YOU WERE HER FRIEND. ROSS CHEATED ON JOAN...MORE THAN ONCE. SAM TOLD ME. SAM WAS A LITTLE BOY. HOW WOULD HE EVEN KNOW THAT? JOAN SAID THE SAME. REALLY? SAM IS SCARED. SOMEONE'S KILLED HIS MOTHER AND HE DOESN'T KNOW WHO OR WHY. JOAN SAID MY DAUGHTER AND I WERE IN DANGER. DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT? YOU THINK THAT WHOEVER KILLED JOAN IS AFTER YOU AND YOUR DAUGHTER? I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO THINK. (MARLA) CAREFUL. IT MIGHT BREAK. (MARLA) YOU CAN'T SERIOUSLY BELIEVE ROSS KILLED HIS EX-WIFE? (CAPTAIN KESSLER) YOU PICKED HIM UP HERE AT THE STUDIO JUST AFTER 4:00PM THAT DAY. WHERE WAS HE FOR THE PREVIOUS TWO HOURS? AND WHERE WERE YOU? ROSS DISAPPEARS SOMETIMES. (MARLA) HE'S GOT A LOT ON HIS MIND; I DO THE SAME. YOU'D UNDERSTAND THE NEED FOR PRIVACY IF YOUR FACE WAS ON TELEVISION EVERY DAY. NOT TO MENTION TWO DOZEN BILLBOARDS AROUND THE CITY. I UNDERSTAND...THE AMAZING DISAPPEARING ACT. DO THE TWO OF YOU EVER PRACTICE THAT TOGETHER? I DON'T KNOW WHERE ROSS WAS THAT DAY. I WAS HAVING MY HAIR CONDITIONED. OH. (MARLA) IT'S WINTER...IT'S DRY. YOU CAN CHECK WITH MY STYLIST. (Dog Barking) ARE YOU OKAY? YES, WHY? YOU JUST DON'T LOOK YOURSELF. I'M FINE, REALLY...I JUST NEED A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP. ROSS? DID YOU LOVE JOAN? A LONG TIME AGO. I LOVE YOU MORE. SO, WHEN WAS IT OVER? HOW DID THAT HAPPEN? WHEN JOAN STARTED DRINKING. AFTER SUZIE...YOU KNOW...THE ACCIDENT. I STUCK IT OUT THE BEST I COULD BUT...I THINK THE KIDS KNEW BEFORE I DID THAT IT WAS OVER. (ROSS) I DON'T THINK I WOULD HAVE EVER LEFT. POOR LAUREN...SHE COULDN'T FIGURE OUT WHY HER DADDY WAS SLEEPING ON THE COUCH. AND THEN I MET YOU AND IT JUST...SEEMED SO EASY. (ROSS) WHY DO YOU WANT TO HEAR THIS? COME TO BED. WHAT WERE YOU DOING THE DAY JOAN WAS KILLED? YOU THINK I MURDERED THE MOTHER OF MY CHILDREN... IS THAT WHAT YOUR ASKING? (BONNIE) NO. NO, I JUST...I CALLED YOU SEVERAL TIMES ON THE CELL AND YOU DIDN'T ANSWER. I WENT FOR A WALK TO CLEAR MY HEAD BEFORE OUR RATINGS MEETING. WE'RE THIRD IN A MARKET OF FOUR. I DON'T THINK I NEED TO EXPLAIN WHAT THAT MEANS. (ROSS) I'VE ALREADY TOLD YOU ALL THIS. YOU WENT FOR A WALK BY YOURSELF? WHAT'S GOING ON... YOU DON'T TRUST ME? YOU KNEW JOAN WAS DEAD AND YOU SHOWED UP AT THAT HOUSE WITH MARLA. (BONNIE) WHY? BECAUSE SHE WAS THERE AND SHE OFFERED TO COME! THAT'S CONVENIENT, ISN'T IT? WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? SAM TOLD HIS ART TEACHER THAT YOU SCREWED AROUND ON JOAN MORE THAN ONCE. NOW YOU TELL ME THAT'S NOT TRUE. YOU TOLD YOUR TEACHER I SCREWED AROUND ON YOUR MOTHER? IT'S THE TRUTH! YOUR MOTHER WAS A DRUNK WHO COULDN'T GET OUT OF BED BEFORE NOON. SHE RUINED OUR LIVES AND NOW YOU WANT TO DESTROY EVERYTHING THAT I HAVE HERE? (SAM) YOU KILLED HER. EVERYONE THINKS IT BUT NO ONE HAS THE COURAGE TO SAY IT OUT LOUD! (BONNIE) TAKE IT EASY, ROSS. SAM...ARE YOU GOING TO BE OKAY? YEAH. HONEY, THERE'S SOMEONE I WANT YOU TO MEET. WHO? MY FATHER... YOUR GRANDFATHER. OH, THAT'S COOL! YEAH, THAT IS COOL. (♪) (BONNIE) YOU KNOW, THIS IS THE HOUSE WHERE WE GREW UP IN. (AMANDA) COOL. (♪) (STEVE) YOU KNOW, THOSE WERE YOUR UNCLE NICK'S TOYS WHEN HE WAS A LITTLE GUY. HERE, LET ME SHOW YOU SOMETHING, OKAY? HERE, WHO'S THIS GUY? (Toy Sounds Slow) (AMANDA) I GUESS HE'S TOO OLD. YEAH...HERE, MAYBE YOU CAN GET IT TO TALK. YOU GOT THE MAGIC TOUCH. (♪) (♪) AND THAT IS YOUR MOTHER. SHE'S NOT MUCH OLDER THAN YOU THERE. IS THE BABY MY UNCLE NICK? THAT'S YOUR UNCLE NICK. AND THIS IS YOUR GRANDMOTHER. THAT'S YOUR MOM'S MOM. (STEVE) CHRISTMAS TIME... (Amanda Laughs) (NICK) WELL, LOOK WHO'S HERE. (AMANDA) HI UNCLE NICK! (NICK) HEY YOURSELF. (♪) POP...WHERE'S BONNIE? (STEVE) SHE'S UPSTAIRS. (NICK) WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I FELT A SMILE ON ME...LOOK, I'M FINE. YOU ALWAYS HATED THIS ROOM. WHAT MADE YOU SO SPECIAL? NO MATTER WHAT YOU DID, THEY ALWAYS FORGAVE YOU. AH, YOU'VE GOT IT BACKWARD. MOM ALWAYS SAID YOU WERE THE PERFECT ONE... HER GOOD LITTLE GIRL. I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU COULD LET POP MOVE BACK IN HERE. HE LEFT US NICK...FOR ANOTHER WOMAN AND I WAS LEFT TO TAKE CARE OF MOM ALL ON MY OWN. HE HAS NO RIGHT TO LIVE IN THIS HOUSE NOW THAT SHE'S DEAD. SHE MADE HERSELF SICK. EVERY TIME A DOCTOR TOLD HER TO GET OUT OF THAT BED SHE FOUND ANOTHER ONE WITH A PRESCRIPTION PAD. (NICK) DON'T YOU REMEMBER? YOU COULDN'T HUG HER... YOU COULDN'T MAKE ANY NOISE. WE WEREN'T ALLOWED TO HAVE OUR FRIENDS OVER. POP LEFT BECAUSE HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO. I KEPT THINKING HE'D COME BACK. MAYBE YOU'RE JUST ANGRY BECAUSE HE DIDN'T TAKE YOU WITH HIM. (NICK) YOU CAN'T CHANGE THE PAST, SIS. (♪) (♪) (♪) (Coughing) (Lauren Gets Sick) LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE GOT LAUREN'S FLU. (BONNIE) I HATE BEING SICK. MY MOTHER WAS ALWAYS SICK. (SAM) MY MOM WAS ALWAYS DRUNK. (BONNIE) OH...THANK YOU. YOU MISS HER, DON'T YOU? IT'S OKAY TO MISS HER, SAM. (♪) (♪) (DR. MILLER) HI BONNIE! (BONNIE) HI. (BONNIE) YOU WERE AWAY, HUH ? (DR. MILLER) YEAH, FOR A COUPLE WEEKS IN FLORIDA. MY BROTHER GOT MARRIED. IT'S HIS SECOND TIME AROUND, SO I HOPE IT STICKS THIS TIME. I'M JUST GOING TO HAVE A LITTLE LOOK HERE, OKAY? (DR. MILLER) HOW LONG HAVE YOU FELT THIS WAY? A WEEK... MAYBE A LITTLE MORE. (DR. MILLER) HURT? (BONNIE) A LITTLE. HOW'S YOUR APPETITE? THE THOUGHT OF FOOD TURNS MY STOMACH. I'VE BEEN EATING BROTH AND SOUP MOSTLY. A LITTLE CHINESE FOOD. (DR. MILLER) IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE LOST SOME WEIGHT, HERE. ARE YOU UNDER ANY UNDUE STRESS? UH ...MY STEPCHILDREN CAME TO LIVE WITH ME. THAT'LL DO IT. GOOD KIDS? I THINK SO, YEAH. THEY'RE TRYING TO KEEP ME FED. MY STEPSON MAKES A MEAN CHICKEN SOUP. OKAY, CAN I HAVE A LISTEN? BREATHE IN FOR ME. GOOD...ONE MORE. GOOD, GOOD. (BONNIE) SO, WILL I LIVE? WELL, IT'S NOT THE FLU. YOU DON'T HAVE A TEMPERATURE. I THINK YOU'RE SUFFERING FROM AN INNER EAR INFECTION. THERE'S SOME INFLAMMATION. SO I'D LIKE TO DO SOME BLOOD JUST TO SEE WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH. WHY DO I FEEL SICK TO MY STOMACH? YOUR BODY'S FIGHTING AN INFECTION. THE INNER EAR CONTROLS YOUR BALANCE. THAT WOULD ACCOUNT FOR THE DIZZINESS AND UPSET STOMACH. (DR. MILLER) YOU SAID THERE WAS BLOOD IN YOUR SALIVA? A LITTLE, YEAH. (DR. MILLER) DO YOU USE A HARD OR SOFT TOOTHBRUSH? HARD. TRY A SOFT. ANY BLOOD IN YOUR STOOL? NO. WELL YOU CAN GET DRESSED AND TAKE THIS TO THE LAB DOWN THE HALL. WE SHOULD HAVE THE RESULTS IN A COUPLE DAYS. SO, WILL THEY TEST FOR AIDS? IS THERE SOMETHING YOU'RE NOT TELLING ME? NO...I'M MARRIED. OKAY. (DR. MILLER) DOWN THE HALL. (DIANA) THANKS FOR COMING WITH ME. YOU KNOW I'M TERRIBLE WITH COLORS. HOW LONG HAVE WE BEEN FRIENDS? SINCE FOREVER. I WENT TO THE DOCTOR TODAY. I HAD AN AIDS TEST. WHY? (BONNIE) WHY NOT? I THINK ROSS IS HAVING AN AFFAIR. REALLY? WITH MARLA. OH, NO WONDER YOU'RE FEELING SICK. HOW LONG DID YOU SAY IT IS? (SAM) ABOUT SIX FEET. ANY IDEAS? THEY LIKE HEAT... HE COULD BE IN A VENT. OH, WE BETTER GET LOOKING THEN. (SAM) HEY, THANKS FOR COMIN' OVER. YEAH, NO SWEAT. HEY, WHERE'S YOUR DAD? OH, HE'S AT WORK. DOES HE KNOW YOUR SNAKE'S MISSING? THEN WE BETTER FIND IT BEFORE HE GETS HOME. COME ON. (♪) (♪) (BONNIE) NICK? WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? UM ...HEARD YOU WERE SICK. CAN I GET A GLASS OF WATER, PLEASE? YEAH. (BONNIE) THANKS. (NICK) YEAH, SURE...I'LL GET THAT FOR YOU. (♪) (Eerie Music) (♪) (♪) (Amanda Screams) (BONNIE) OH! COME WITH ME! (SAM) HEY, DON'T KILL IT! (NICK) ALRIGHT, SAM, PUT THAT THING AWAY BEFORE IT KILLS SOMEONE. (BONNIE) HOW DARE YOU BRING A GUN INTO MY HOUSE! INTO MY DAUGHTER'S BEDROOM! (NICK) I'M SORRY. YOU'VE NEVER BEEN SORRY FOR ANYTHING A DAY IN YOUR LIFE, NICK. I'M CALLING THE POLICE AND THIS TIME I MEAN IT. BONNIE...I AM THE POLICE. (BONNIE) THAT'S QUITE A STORY, NICK. (NICK) IT'S THE TRUTH. (LAUREN) I'LL STAY WITH AMANDA UNTIL SHE FALLS ASLEEP. (BONNIE) THANK YOU LAUREN. I DON'T BELIEVE THIS. I DIDN'T THINK YOU WOULD. (BONNIE) WHY SHOULD I? I DIDN'T GO TO PRISON, BONNIE. THAT WAS ALL JUST PART OF A SHOW. DEEP COVER. THE COURT AND THE TRIAL...I WAS THERE NICK. DOES POP KNOW? NO. (BONNIE) HE'D BE PROUD. WHAT'S YOU'RE CONNECTION TO JOAN AND DON'T TELL ME THERE ISN'T ONE. AH... SHE CALLED ME MUMBLING ABOUT WHATEVER HAD HAPPENED TO HER DAUGHTER WAS GOING TO HAPPEN TO AMANDA. WHAT'S GOING ON NICK... WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT? I DON'T KNOW BUT SHE SOUNDED SCARED. WELL, SHE HAD A GOOD REASON TO BE. I DON'T KNOW... (ROSS) HEY...SORRY I'M LATE. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? AHH ...I JUST CAME OVER FOR A CUP OF COFFEE. I GOTTA GO... SEE YOU GUYS. (BONNIE) SEE YA. (JOSH) YOUR CALL SURPRISED ME... I DIDN'T THINK I'D HEAR FROM YOU AGAIN. (BONNIE) WELL, I COULD USE A FRIEND. JOSH, I NEED TO GET SOME ANSWERS AND I THINK YOU WERE THE PERSON WHO KNEW JOAN BEST. WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW? WELL, I COULD NEVER UNDERSTAND HOW SHE COULD LEAVE A LITTLE BABY IN THE BATH UNATTENDED...SO SMALL. DIDN'T ROSS TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED? ROSS BLAMED JOAN... SUZIE'S DEATH...THAT'S WHY THEY DIVORCED...IT'S NOT A GOOD PLACE TO GO. YOU CAN'T CHANGE THE PAST. SO MY BROTHER SAYS. JOAN MADE A MISTAKE. IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT... ONE SHE COULDN'T ERASE NO MATTER HOW HARD SHE DRANK. SAM WAS IN THE KITCHEN... HE SET OFF THE SMOKE ALARM. HE WAS FOOLING AROUND WITH THE STOVE...TRYING TO BAKE HIMSELF A BIRTHDAY CAKE. THE KITCHEN FILLED WITH SMOKE AND HE SCREAMED. ROSS WAS AT WORK? (JOSH) RIGHT. JOAN WAS UPSTAIRS BATHING SUZIE. SHE RAN DOWNSTAIRS TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH THE SMOKE. SHE WAS ONLY GONE FOR A MINUTE. AND SAM NEVER TALKED TO YOU ABOUT THIS? (JOSH) NO...NO, HE'S BLOCKED IT OUT COMPLETELY. JOAN ACTUALLY ENVIED HIM FOR THAT. JOAN KEPT A SCRAPBOOK WITH PHOTOS AND CLIPPINGS OF AMANDA AND ME. HAVE YOU EVER SEEN THAT? NO, THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE JOAN. I DON'T THINK SHE EVEN OWNED A CAMERA. BUT AGAIN, I DIDN'T KNOW SHE OWNED A GUN. (Bonnie's Cell Phone Rings) (BONNIE) EXCUSE ME. HELLO? BONNIE, IT'S DR. MILLER. I'M LOOKING AT THE RESULTS OF YOUR BLOOD TEST... (BONNIE) THE AIDS TEST? NO, THAT WAS NEGATIVE. BONNIE, THERE ARE HIGH LEVELS ARSENIC IN YOUR BLOOD SYSTEM. WHAT...HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE? MOST LIKELY, RAT POISON. SOMEONE'S TRYING TO KILL ME! (BONNIE) AMANDA, COME ON... OUT OF THE CAR. (BONNIE) I JUST PULLED AMANDA OUT OF SCHOOL. DON'T YOU TELL ME TO CALM DOWN, KESSLER, SOMONE'S TRYING TO KILL ME! (JOSH) I GOT IT...I GOT IT! (JOSH) D.M.S.A...AND THE PHARMACIST SAYS YOU NEED TO DRINK LOTS OF LIQUIDS TO FLUSH YOUR SYSTEM, OKAY? (BONNIE) THANK YOU. (JOSH) GOOD. SO...DID YOU FIND ANYTHING? I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR...RAT POISON'S ODOURLESS AND TASTELESS... IT COULD BE IN ANYTHING. BUT ONLY YOU GOT SICK SO IT'S NOT THE MILK. (BONNIE) RIGHT. CHICKEN SOUP... WHO MADE THIS? SAM. CAN I HAVE SOME? (BONNIE) NO, HONEY. (AMANDA) PLEASE MOM, PLEASE! NO! (BONNIE) DIANA, IT'S ME BONNIE. IF YOU'RE THERE, PICK UP! OKAY, LISTEN, AMANDA AND I ARE COMING OVER TO YOUR HOUSE. I'LL EXPLAIN EVERYTHING TO YOU WHEN YOU GET HOME, BUT PLEASE CALL ME ON MY CELL. AND WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T TELL ANYBODY WHERE I AM. (BONNIE) LET'S GO. COME ON. (BONNIE) SHE KEEPS A KEY HERE SOMEWHERE. SHE'S ALWAYS LOCKING HERSELF OUT. (JOSH) ALRIGHT, THE DOCTOR SAYS YOU'RE SICK... YOU NEED AS MUCH WATER AS POSSIBLE, OKAY? I'LL GET YOU SOME. (BONNIE) I'M REALLY SORRY TO GET YOU INVOLVED IN ALL THIS, JOSH. I DIDN'T MEAN FOR THAT TO HAPPEN. (JOSH) JOAN WAS MY FRIEND. (JOSH) THERE YOU GO. (BONNIE) THANK YOU. (BONNIE) WHERE DID AMANDA GO? AMANDA? WHAT ARE YOU DOING? (Diana Yelps) YOU SON OF A BITCH! (♪) (♪) IT'S KESSLER, I NEED A FAVOUR. JUST A LITTLE ONE. FIND OUT WHAT MALL "PHOTO 2000" IS IN. IT MUST BE ONE OF THE BIG SUBURBAN JOBS. YEAH, AND THEN I NEED YOU TO CHECK WITH SECURITY... TELL THEM I WANT EVERY SINGLE TAPE FROM EVERY CAMERA THEY'VE GOT...INSIDE AND OUT. OH COME ON, SETTLE DOWN. IT'S NOVEMBER 12TH, 3:15PM. TWO WEEKS AGO...THAT SHOULD MAKE IT EASY FOR THEM. YEAH, CALL ME AS SOON AS YOU HEAR. BYE. (BONNIE) HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN SLEEPING WITH MY BEST FRIEND, ROSS? (ROSS) A COUPLE MONTHS. (BONNIE) HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO ME? IT DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING. WHAT...IT DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING? WHAT DOES? CERTAINLY NOT ME OR YOUR CHILDREN. HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO THEM, ROSS? WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO ME AND AMANDA? ROSS, STAY AWAY FROM ME...DON'T TOUCH ME! (ROSS) I'M SO SORRY. I DON'T THINK THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH. (♪) (ROSS) IT'S ONLY TEMPORARY. (LAUREN) THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID LAST TIME. (♪) (♪) (CAPTAIN KESSLER) STOP RIGHT THERE. (CAPTAIN KESSLER) CAN YOU MAKE ME A HARD COPY? (♪) (SAM) BONNIE...BONNIE! (BONNIE) SAM, WHAT IS IT? (SAM) YOU BETTER COME SEE. (♪) (♪) (LAUREN) DON'T TOUCH. (♪) (LAUREN) YOU PLAY WITH YOUR OWN THINGS, NOT MINE. (♪) (Bonnie Knocks) (BONNIE) AMANDA? (BONNIE) AMANDA ARE YOU IN THERE? (BONNIE) LAUREN, UNLOCK THE DOOR PLEASE. CALL THE POLICE AND CALL NICK. TELL HIM TO GET HERE RIGHT AWAY.

(CAPTAIN KESSLER) IT'S JOAN'S .357. I WAS HIS FAVORITE UNTIL YOU TOOK HIM AWAY! (♪) (Police Siren) (♪) SHUT UP YOU LITTLE BRAT! I DON'T LIKE YOU ANYMORE. DID I EVER TELL YOU I DROWNED MY BABY SISTER? WELL, I DID...AND YOU'RE IN MY WAY LITTLE GIRL... SO WATCH YOURSELF OR YOU'LL BE NEXT! (Both Cry) (BONNIE) LAUREN, HONEY, YOUR FATHER'S HERE... HE WANTS TO TALK TO YOU. (ROSS) LAUREN SWEETHEART...LET ME IN. (ROSS) LAUREN...I'VE MADE SOME MISTAKES BUT I CAN FIX THEM. WE CAN BE A FAMILY AGAIN. NEVER COULD...NEVER WILL! IT'S NOT TRUE, HONEY...YES WE CAN. I MADE YOU SICK YOU STUPID BITCH! I EVEN MADE MYSELF SICK...YOU SHOULD BE DEAD! YOU MADE MY MOM SICK? (ROSS) PLEASE LAUREN... OPEN THE DOOR FOR ME. I'LL NEVER LEAVE YOU AGAIN...I PROMISE.
