"Oh, blue lotus (Neelathamara)." "You have worn flowers." "In my mind." "Oh, blue lotus." "You have worn flowers." "In my mind." "Oh, blue lotus." "You made waves..." "...in the river." "You have worn the bunch of peacock feathers..." "...which I wished to see that day." "One day, I became wet in your tears." "Sun is far away from here. Oh, beauty, wake up slowly." "My eyes are twinkling to see you." "Oh, blue lotus." "You have worn flowers." "In my mind." "When I write a preface on you..." "I feel your beauty when the wind arrives." "Your story made my mind wet." "Sun is far away from here. Oh, beauty, wake up slowly." "My eyes are twinkling to see you." Okay. Very good. Take this. - Okay. Next. We also heard that. Nowadays, no one keeps money and so no flower blossoms. Actually, that is not lotus. That is something else. The stem and root is still there now. Sometimes flower would blossom. That is not a big wonder. - Cut it. Most of the people believed in that. At first, your father also teased by calling it a superstition. After that, he too started believing. If some wonders occur in our area, no one will believe it. An outsider should come and tell. That is people's mentality. Why didn't you tell me early that I can be seen like this in the laptop? Then I would have dressed well. Grandmother, you are looking beautiful in this dress too. How are you? Getting well. Now, I can walk a little. We were going to hospital to see you. Then we came to know that you are at home now. Going to see patients in hospital is one of the customs here. But if it is at the house, they won't come. Like going to temple, they will go to see patients in hospital. I will come tomorrow. Now, the bridge is completed and the car will come till the yard. Then why are you staying in TB? Other people are there too. You know her? - No. Daughter of Haridasan. She is working in television. I would watch all the serials. But I didn't see you ever. That may not be seen here. Are you coming tomorrow? My fiancee wants to see you, Grandmother. Yours? Yes. Come here. Does he know Malayalam? First, you see him, Maluty Amma. "Squirrel, come and make friendship with me." "Squirrel, come and make friendship with me." I heard you have come to this place. My unit too is with me. We are staying in a guest-house. The old lady Kaali's daughter Paru is there for mother's help. She wants to go. Just now, I arranged one home nurse. Anyway, I see you two together now. So, I want to tell you something. - What? My two sons are working abroad. Not bad. The existing house was renovated and a new house was built. I heard all that, Achuthan Nair. You wait for a second. You too have to hear that. I have been here since my childhood. Your Maluty Amma didn't see me like a caretaker. I know. Lots of people have an eye on this house and the property. Now, everybody who is in this village have money. Don't sell it to an outsider. My children are ready to buy this. That is only after mother's death. After that, she has the right to that and not me. Oh. He got married again. Yes. There's a rule. - That's new for me. No one shows rush for that. Grandmother will live long. Now, she is only 80. After you leave, I'm thinking that who will be here. Kunjukutty would be there in the kitchen. I have to go. Daughter's delivery date is near. She is alone there. Till she delivers a child, you will have to be there. - Yes. You don't worry about me. Ratnam, what all are your programmes? Children are alone in Bangalore. My husband has gone for a course to Shimla. Why didn't you bring your children? You are not a stranger to me. When will that nurse come? God is calling back the youngsters early. Those who are burden to others are still here. These all are God's plays. Did you recognise me? Kunjimalu is still looking young. If I say, anyone would believe. Yesterday too, I dreamt of her. I also had doubt. I am seeing you after a long time. I recognise you. Hello. If needed, I will call you. No. Not anymore. Okay. My daughter told me that you came from hospital slightly cured. Now, she called me. She came two times along with Dr. Kurien. That slim girl with spectacles. Yes. Is that your daughter? She cared for me specially. Then why didn't she tell me she is Kunjimalu's daughter? She is a lady doctor. I didn't know that. She knows. About my stay here. Her behavior is good. Whenever she takes injection she will tell me to close... ...the eyes and there would be just a little pain. Kunjimalu's daughter. I would enquire about you. I heard that you have two daughters. What does the younger one do? She has completed her B. Ed. Now, she is a teacher. Near to our house. It is happy to hear that everybody is keeping well. What about Appukuttan? His name is Appukuttan, right? You didn't forget, right? Doing business. It is going well. I will call you later. Do you remember that Master who sat under this banyan tree? Don't remember well. Raghavan? Are you going inside to pray? - No. Kunjimalu, you go and come. Kalyani, I am going. I didn't recognise you. I am from Kizhakkampattu. Malukutty Amma's daughter-in-law. Daughter of Balan Menon, right? - Yes. After Dasan's death, you got married again, right? I heard that. In that marriage, how many children you have? - Two. What is he doing? Let's go. Okay. What all does he want to know? He is Pandit master of Sharath house. Did you remember Ammini of Sharath house? Most of the things, I don't remember. I was here only for short time. "You go see Devi and come back." "I will go and kill Ravanan." "Nothing will happen to you." "Let auspicious things happen." Eyes are okay. But I can't read more now. There is no difficulty for the first phase of sleep. Once I am awake, I have to be in bed sleepless till morning. Oh. My God. You sleep on the top. - Yes. You also sleep. You have to go in the morning, know? Oh, Lord Krishna. All these are done by Beena. After searching, she kept it like this. Her father wrote stories and poems. She may search for that. Has she got anything? Where has she got time for speaking? She doesn't call. And doesn't send reply to my letter. I heard he had died. What was his sickness? He always mentioned he had headache. When diagnosed, it was brain tumor. It didn't cure with treatment. Now, you... Its good luck that a nice man came again. Most of the people think about my re-marriage as an offence. Beena too. This mother never has any complaint on that. He took my photo. But I didn't see. Keep this. Your children can see how you were in your youth. Should I keep? - Keep it. Old memories are the best asset to be kept in old age. You may curse me a lot for grabbing your dreams. I cursed myself. For my foolishness. I am sleeping in the next room. You sleep here. No. I will sleep down. No. I am sleeping there. It will be slightly cold in the morning. Those days at night, the singer had sung, now, also someone is singing. Now, who is there to sing? Not sleeping? After sometime. I forgot to tell you something. There is one letter in my cupboard. My ex-husband had written it for you. Four days before death. He put that letter in envelope and wrote the address. Then said, "Don't send." He told me to tear it off. I didn't tear it. I never knew that I will meet you here. I will send that letter to you. No. - He wrote that letter for you. I didn't read that. I didn't feel like. I don't want it. I don't want to read it. He remembered me once and wrote something. I am happy to hear that. "What is life?" "What is happiness?" "What is life?" "What is happiness?" "Only God knows." "What is life?" "What is happiness?" Where are you going? - Going to Kizhakkumpattu. Come. This is why I told not to come. Be careful. It is going to rain. Please come on the porch. I am not well. I can't walk. Please sit. Maithan told us one girl is needed here. - Yes. The caretaker of here has told Maithan about that. No one is there to help me in the kitchen since the last few days. You know to cook? - A little bit. We are Vellapillai. This is my granddaughter. She has four young siblings. After her mother's death, our situation has been worse. Who is he? - My grandson. He ran away from the house five years back and has returned now. He doesn't help me in my work. He knows making bread. He will go for that work. Now, who wants us to wash their clothes? Soap and iron box are there in all houses. Then also some houses are still available. If we do that work, what will we get? Only two drums of rice during Onam and Vishu (festivals). They don't give us money. - Appukuttan. I am alone here. I will do most of the cooking myself. There is somebody for outside work. I need a person to help me. Give me some water. How much did Maithan tell you as salary? This is a reputed family. They will do as per what's necessary. This house. Oh! Sweeping itself would be a big job. This old woman told you and you came. You should tolerate everything. That would be at least for my medicine and oil. This is buttermilk. Whenever my son comes in the evening I make some snacks. He is studying in Ernakulam. You stay here and go tomorrow. No. I will come later. She doesn't have any experience. - No problem. Caretaker will come and give her every month's salary. You can come here occasionally. You know what I told you. Appukuttan, let's go. - Yes. Buttermilk. What is your name? - Kunjimalu. Same name of mine. In my childhood, everybody called me Maluty. I haven't received the full amount for the coconuts. Last month's balance is also there. - He will give. He is a miser. What about the estate? - I already told three people. The Arecanut's money is also pending. I know. I have already told him. I need Rs.15 Why didn't you take from this? I want the accounts to always be proper. Holy lamp. Holy lamp. Holy lamp. Holy lamp. Maithan has sent her. She is a Vellapillai girl from the other side of the river. Small girl. Why didn't you keep someone who is little aged? She said she knows household work a little bit. I also need someone in my house. Narayani is not well. She is not able to do any work. May I go. - Yes. There is one more bed underneath. - Yes. You sleep on the floor. - Yes. Are your younger siblings studying? - Yes. Two of them. One in the second standard and the other in fifth. Your father won't give you anything? - That time, he had given. After his second marriage, he didn't give anything. He has two children from that too. If it is man or woman, fate should be good. "Hey, Lord Krishna." This singer always sings like this if he suffers from a lot of pain. He has been lying due to paralysis since two years. Poor man. But now too, his voice is still strong. Kunjimalu, would you get up in the morning? - Yes. I didn't see you before. - I'm from Kizhakkampattu. Yes. I heard that someone had come there to stay. I am Ammini of Sharath House. Oh! Today, the flower has blossomed. Yes. Someone has kept money yesterday. Priest Vaidyamadom came yesterday. He may have kept money on the steps. Have you heard about this flower's specialty? - No. This flower is needed for some veneration in the temple. People will come from a lot of places. They will keep money to fulfill their wishes. If we keep money for testing, then flower won't blossom. Who are we to test God? Ammini, did your sister-in-law come? - No. She will come this week. Has Haridasan come? - Who? Maluty Amma's son. - No. Take bath fast, otherwise it will be crowded. Master, did you have tea. I not only had tea, but breakfast too. Restaurant owner Nanu gave it free to me. Master, you started smoking? - Everything is just a smoke. Smoke and screen is smokescreen. This is the gift of Velu. Ammini, donors are increasing day by day. This is master who always sits under the banyan tree. He studied music from Thanjavoor and Kumbhakonam. But he is little mad. - Doesn't he have a family? No. He is alone... Stop. Stop. Is this girl from Kizhakkumpattu? - Yes. Good. Here, someone's mind is to be washed and cleaned. For that, some more soda powder is needed. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I forgot to ask you. Did you bring sufficient dresses? - Yes. What do you want as breakfast? Semolina is there. I will make upma (food item). No. We both are here. You make lunch early. When Haridasan comes, he needs breakfast in the morning. He needs something to eat in the evening too. Flower has blossomed in the temple pond. Someone may have prayed. Outsiders believe in that a lot. What curry is to be made? Pluck banana from the estate. Okra and peas are near the well. Pluck some from there. Make dry dish with banana and peas. With okra, you make curry. That's enough. Kaali. Kaali. What happened? - I was calling to give her food. Look, after he comes, don't make any noise. He doesn't like that. He got his father's character. But nothing inside. His exams are over. When is he coming? Oh! You came? Come. Come. Come. Slowly. Someone is coming here. Then don't make noise. Stand properly. It is you. Stars of the day. C.P. Haridasan. C.P. Haridasan. Be careful. Are you on the way? - Yes. Your studies over? - Yes. I heard that the work on the bridge at Vellankallil would start soon. Is it? - Then we can make road till our house. All the fields belong to us. If the boat is not there, what would Beeran do? They said about the bridge during election. Chances of coming are less. I thought you came after going to uncle Balan's house. I wrote a letter to him. I will go afterwards. - Okay. Kunjimalu. - Yes? I will tell you what to make. - Yes. Is Meenakshi Amma not there in kitchen? I send her back. Sometimes she would steal something. How many times should I forgive her? Put your clothes under the staircase. She will wash. - Okay. Make curry with lentils and leaves of drum-stick. Using banana, make a dry dish. Make dry chilly fry too. He doesn't want a lot of dishes. Do you know how to make fish curry? - Yes. Not for today. Kunjan may bring river fish for him. After you finish your work, wash his clothes. Achuthan will take and get it ironed from the market. If iron box is here, then I'll do. - He doesn't like that. I am going. Why are you in such a hurry? He is here. Go after lunch. I'll come later. I'm having some work with the document writer. - Okay. Kunjimalu, what are today's dishes? Special for the advocate. Pumpkin and other vegetables are there in the garden. He doesn't like that. This is from the temple. My sister's offering. She came? - Yes. Problem has started. Both children are naughty. If they break the house, then also brother-in-law won't say anything. Sister-in-law will always find a fault in whatever we make and give. That is the problem. My brother got three months leave. My brother eats everything. In the morning, there was veneration in the temple by my sister-in-law. One day, you go and bring one pudding (Kheer) from the temple. Dasan likes that very much. Till your sister-in-law and children leave... ...you have lot of work at home, right? Now, you are 22, right, Ammini? - Yes I always thought of asking your mother about your marriage? Has any proposal come? Whatever uncle likes, that horoscope won't match. Uncle won't like the proposal which matches horoscope. There is Mangal (planet) in my horoscope. What can I do, Maluty Amma? What does your uncle say about your job? Uncle Balan already has eight-nine juniors. He is planning to take me too. So what? Your uncle is a reputed advocate. I told uncle that I don't want the job of advocate. First, result should come. - You are tensed after your exams. This time around, I am scared. I didn't write one exam well. Not only me, but everybody. "Praising the Lord." "Praising the Lord." You smoke a lot these days. - No. No. Only once in a while. - Okay. After the singer was paralysed, the people here had taken interest in music, right? Sometimes he is silent and sometimes he sings. I will tell all my friends about master & singer. Veladuyan Master is not there, right? You father always said... ...that the glory of this temple won't be anywhere in the world. God here is very good. The story is that he comes in the morning after going to meet three women. Don't say nonsense. Go and sleep. You came after travelling. That girl didn't keep water for drinking. Kunjimalu. Keep one tumbler full of warm water... ...and in a clay pot, take normal water too. Give me a glass of water. Don't run. Stop. Don't show naughtiness. - I didn't see you in the temple pond. I am menstruating. Haridasan is not there? - Yes. He is always reading in his room. Hi! It is rolled gold. But looks like gold. - Yes. My brother brought it from Coimbatore. - Is it? We want to see the lamps in the Cherangara temple. Children want to see that. Brother told me to come. Are you coming? - No. I will take permission from Maluty Amma. - No. no. I want to give milk At Emranthiri's house. Thrice a day. Look here. Like that. Okay. Now, look here. Smile. Please stand there. Catch that pot. Like that. Keep the other hand. Smile. Very good. Catch that branch. Like that. Smile. Smile nicely. Stand there. Stand a bit closer. Look here. Did anything happen? Nothing happened to the camera. Don't want it too hot. Too hot. Your hand also got hurt, right? No problem. Enough. Camphor powder is there in the bathroom. While bathing, put that also. Take bath in hot water. If needed, I will keep hot water in the bathroom upstairs. There is nothing to worry about it. Go do your work. "The song you pine for..." "I have found that song for you." Is it paining? Swelling is not there. I want this to go slowly. I like your hot massage. Have you done your studies? I studied only up to eighth grade. Do you have jacket and half sari? Yes. I got one pair. I can take better photos. Film is there. Look here. If mother has slept, then come upstairs. You don't worry. I want to ask something to you. Come up. Hey! - Yes! Look! Be careful while climbing the staircase. The third step will make some sound. "Always live happily." "Always live happily." "Oh, God, give us happiness." "Always live happily." Good morning. I thought you will come. I don't have time even to bathe. Early morning itself children need breakfast. If I have Rs.1, then I would keep on the step and pray. What is special to know about? - Something is there. Don't test God. This is not for testing God. I want to know something urgently. - Is it a secret? It is not like that. If we don't know something right or wrong, then who will tell us? God, right? - Is it? What happened? You have some doubt? No. Nothing. Yes. Your face is saying that. Would the flower blossom if somebody who doesn't have... ...money with him goes to pray? That depends on the person who needs it. What purpose does God need money? For someone, reply would be in lotus pond, for some others... ...it would be on the branch of the banyan tree... ...and sometimes in sky, stars, clouds, etcetera. Everybody is asking including me. But I am not getting a satisfying answer. "Four people who are having the blaze of sun came and sat there slowly." "Princess has lost the curse which she got from the animal." "Lord Rama had slowly caught the hand of Sita." I went to the post office. I booked a phone and sat for long time. But I didn't get it. Here. I will eat later. Come at night. Kunjimalu. "He has become a lover." "More than that he is infatuated." "Is the moon standing at the step in hurry?" "He has become a lover." "More than that he is infatuated." "Is the moon standing at the step in hurry?" "The flower which hasn't blossomed has been moving..." "...today without its knowledge." "New shining..." "Has slight sleep." "He has become a lover." "More than that he is infatuated." "Is the moon standing at the step in hurry?" "Is in hurry to come down." "Fun and smile fills the mind." "Water floats due to chill." "Sun and shadow comes in the yard." "Eyes are moving with lust." "Is it due to the fear in mind..." "Is it due to see more?" "Just come and sit with me on the steps." "Waiting is sorrowful." "Watching in silence." - "Silence." "He has become a lover." "More than that he is infatuated." "Is the moon standing at the step in hurry?" "Is in hurry to come down." "River and rain touches the head." "That creates a good feeling." "Blue flower forgets to blossom in the mind." "Sometimes I feel shy and sometimes not." "Listens music to live." "Days left alone." "With the smell of night..." "With the beauty of night light..." - "...will join again." "He has become a lover." "More than that he is infatuated." "Is the moon standing at the step in hurry?" "Is in hurry to come down." This time nobody has prayed by keeping money on the steps. Praying by keeping money is not important. That is only one custom. Someone may have prayed devotionally. It had happened early too. You got the hand itself. Not this. Don't be in hurry. This one! Look, what is that? I too got one. Now, I want to see you playing. You put the card. "What is life?" "What is happiness?" "What is life?" "What is happiness?" "What is life?" "What is happiness?" "Only God knows that." "What is life?" "What is happiness?" "Only God knows that." "What is life?" "What is happiness?" "Do not be stubborn. Stop that for now." "This night will not return." "Do not be stubborn. Stop that for now." "This night will not return." "You may not agree, yet it is my declaration..." "Realisation of the truth will come to you." "So do not stop." "This night will not return." "Should I pray? Should I offer obeisance?" "You only say what I should do." "Should I pray? Should I offer obeisance?" "You only say what I should do." "I feel your gaze on me..." "...Making me have faith in you." "Do not be stubborn." "Halt that for now." "This night will not return." "You may not agree, yet it is my declaration..." "Realisation of the truth will come to you." "Pause amidst desire." "The body is on fire." "Every moment is..." "...full of completeness." "All that occurred in our past life..." "...is bound to return tonight." "Do not be stubborn. Stop that for now." "This night will not return." Here. Here. My sister has given birth. It's a baby girl again. I went there for buying poppadum. Dasan likes poppadums very much. You want to see the baby. She has got good colour and lot of hair. I will come later. Ammini, do you know English? What happened? I know a little bit. Sister's husband sometimes teaches me little bit. What is the meaning of safe? - I think it means cupboard. Then what is the meaning of sweet? Sweet means everything which is delicious. The dishes like laddu (round sweets) etcetera are called sweets. Who is there to give you lecture in English? No one. I just asked. That's all. Be careful. If English is started, then be careful. Someone else has started speaking English to me. Has advocate started teaching you English? - You are mad. I am going to post office. If I get the professor under control then I could know the result early. Are you scared about your exams? I can't say anything about that. You don't worry. Nothing will happen. I will make everything proper. I am not joking. There is one solution for all that. Are you one among the Board of Examiners? What? What did you say? You are not putting the marks. - Don't tease me. There is a person who knows everything. It is for you. Don't be in hurry. Drink. I want one rupee. Has someone come from your house? This is for an offering in the temple. One rupee note is there in the coin box. Take from that. She is from a Vellalapillai family. Her behaviour is good. She is also a believer in God. Very nice girl. Meenakshi had given me rice and curry in an unmannered way. She is not like that. Didn't you tell me that? I will not tell you about that. - Then it won't be a small matter. You kept Re.1 and prayed. May I tell you? - Yes. One proposal has come for Kunjimalu. You want to know if it would happen or not. - No... I will tell you later. Please don't ask me anything now. Where is my mother? - She is in the kitchen. Now, don't worry about the exam. Whatever you have expected, all that will be fulfilled soon. Look. This is temple's offering. For my offering, whatever you expected all that will be fulfilled. Yes. - A telegram for you. I have opened it. This is uncle Balan's telegram. I passed the exam with distinction. - That means? I got marks more than first class. I am going to tell your mother. Oh! My God! Postman is not appointed. Only delivery agent is there. He will give the letter at the nearby restaurant. I kept tea for you. Bring here. - Snack is also there. I made your favourite snack. Mother will say something based on what I liked in my childhood. He came from my house. Please sit. I have come to Palathara market. So, I thought to meet you. Is he the advocate? His studies are over. But he's not become an advocate yet. I have sent this month's salary in the hands of Achuthan Nair. I didn't come to collect that. That is a relief for grandmother. With that also her burden won't end. I have to inform the bakery shop. This is a new company. They will give me reasonable salary too. Everybody is saying not to go. Do something here. What is your opinion? I am not to decide that. - You should also think. What you are thinking? Are you thinking of working in someone's house always? Who is this? Appukuttan! Kunjimalu, give him one cup of tea. - No. I came to this palace. So, I just came to meet her. She is having no problem here. I am looking her like my own child. He wants to marry you, right? Who told you? I understood that by reading his face. What is wrong in that? Kunjimalu, where is the packet containing Kondattam? It is there. - Have it. I have wrapped it with clothes. It won't float. If you want anything else then write a letter to me. Achuthan will bring that to you. - Yes. Mother, I am not going to a far place. I will come here on every Saturday and Sunday. You come inside. Dasan is going. Vellalapillai girls are not good for premonition. - Yes. I will send you letter. - Okay. Soon after he completed his studies, he got a job too. Everything is God's blessings. Oh! Vellalapillai girls are not good for premonition! She is saying because of her prayer only he got a job. Anyone knows the truth. Take sugar separately. - Okay. I don't know whether he is using sugar or not. If they are also for lunch then I have to make one more curry. No. The clerk told me that they are going soon. They have one more house in Ottapalam. Keep all this on the table. I will make tea. No snacks are there to give you. Go after lunch. Lunch is ready. Two people are standing outside. Kunjimalu, give these to them too. - Okay. His job is nice. Quarters are also good. Earlier, that was the bungalow of a foreigner. Ratnam also liked everything. She needs space for making garden. There is a big yard. I am planning to conduct the marriage before July. We are not outsiders. So, there is no need to waste time for seeing girl engagement, etcetera. But Haridas is saying he wants to get married after sometime. His job will also be permanent by that time. There is no such problem with his job. I am handling most of the cases of the company. They took him because of my recommendation. Do you know that? - He knows all that. Even then... Do you know Ratnam's age? She is 24 now. Lot of proposals came for her. She didn't like. She wants to marry only Dasan. He also knows that. He stayed there for four years. It is very difficult to get a good marriage hall at Guruvayoor. Our progenitors said to slap him and then send him. That is enough, right? When coming here, you arrange tea party for... ...distant relatives and lunch for our close relatives. Whoever wants to, let them come to Guruvayoor. I will arrange food for 500 people there. No need to have luxury. If his friends come a day before marriage, then I will... ...book two floors in Dwaraka on rent. Now, I am not getting his letter. No news about him. I will inform after he comes. I told him to come tomorrow. Don't make anything more. They are not waiting to have lunch. When they took him for studies, I expected that. - So what? Balan will get a boy better than my son for his daughter. It is a big thing that they have come for this alliance. Malukuty! - Yes. Someone is there in front of the house. Why did you walk so much? Appukuttan is not giving me any relief. He is asking me when you will come. How can I come just like that? Give me one piece of tobacco. Kunjimalu. - Yes. I will come. Your grandmother came again, right? After marriage, you go back. Appukuttan is also a nice fellow. He will get a job outside and you can help your family too. In our age, we will dream that a prince will come and marry us. Nothing will happen. That is my experience. Malukuty Amma! - Yes! I have seen Das coming. This is fresh fish. You give that fish at Achuthan's house. We are alone here. I told him to go in the morning. He panicked. Balan did everything fast. After all, for his marriage, he too has some opinion. Then, I am going. Not to that side. This side is east. I told him to buy a new bed and coat. They are not going to stay here. Then too. They need one bedroom here. Keep some fruits on that round table. Why didn't you go for marriage? Mother doesn't go for son's marriage. That is an old custom. Now, all that might be changed. Now, lunch may start after marriage. Achuthan will come early. He will arrange everything for the workers. You too help them. Usually, this is done by sister or aunt. No one is there for him. You got that luck. What happened? Are you not well? Singer had fainted yesterday. He lost his sound. Now, I remain. The singer's sound loss is equivalent to his death. Next is me. For me, it would be a mental disease. Severe mental disease. Oh, God! Call me back before that. Ratnam, you didn't sleep yet? I don't know. I didn't feel sleepy. Sometimes, I feel he is there on the top floor. I feel his tread. I feel he had put on the music. First, both of you should pray in the temple. Go inside and pray. Take the offering. God bless you. Look. One special flower will blossom there. Keep money and pray. If the flower is blossomed on the next day, then that wish will be fulfilled. Did you hear about this? - No. The people here believe it. Dasan, have you ever tested? - Me... No. That's all madness. Have you given something to eat for outside workers? - Yes. How long you are working here? - Four-five months. If it is for top stairs, take normal water. He won't drink cumin water. Now also people are there in the frontage. While sleeping, close the window at the south side. Cat will come through that side. Kunjimalu, are you taking bath in the temple pond? If we keep money then the flower will blossom. If the flower has blossomed then our wish will be fulfilled. Is it true? People are saying like that. Kunjimalu, have you ever tested that? Kunjimalu, in the morning, we need more milk. I forgot to tell Achuthan. I informed Embranthiri. - Oh! You remembered that! Be careful while stepping the staircase. The third step is broken. She will do everything. Her grandmother told me to send her back after marriage. I have agreed that half-minded. Why she is going back? - She is not hurry. Her uncle's son is in hurry. He wants to marry her soon. "Lord Ram, Lord Ram..." Did you sleep? No. What happened? Singer is not able to sing now. Then who is singing now? I am not hearing anything. You may felt that. "The small lotus in the path of the disappeared daylight..." "Who you are searching for..." "With the mind full of pain..." "Like a pale blue..." "You will be alone now." "Remain as pain in the gloomy pond." "The small lotus in the path of the disappeared daylight." "Who you are searching for?" "With the mind full of pain..." "In the morning..." "Daylight will kiss." "Spring will come with a little provocation." "When you are alone..." "When you come to the yard..." "You heart will twitch." "There would be some broken song..." "...on your dry lips." "You turn to see someone coming." "One spine pierced into your mind..." "Your mind is burning..." "The small lotus in the path of the disappeared daylight." "Well-being is burning..." "Like fire in your mind." "Voice is soaking like pain..." "In the petal." "Even then you cuddle the eyes." "Your dreams are burnt during when you blossomed..." "You are blossomed only for crying." "Earlier and now, your dreams are the same." "The small lotus in the path of the disappeared daylight." "Whom you are searching for?" "With the mind full of pain." Ammini. Nowadays, you are not seeing out. Your sister and children already left. Then why are you busy? I am not well. I am also busy there. Meet you tomorrow morning. - See you tomorrow. I am also coming. I kept money on the step and prayed. Don't try to test God. I don't know cooking. Mother told me you know to make food which Dasan likes. Are you coming with us to Ernakulam? Mother will get someone else. Let mother decide. What about your marriage? Do you like him? I don't have any love or hatred toward him. Let mother decide. Don't you make your own decision? What is use of my decision? I am going to give my old saris to that girl. Who? - Kunjimalu. I am taking her out by wearing sari. For a walk. Buy a new sari for her as a marriage gift. This is not too old. This will suit her nicely. If she wears a sari, she looks like a girl belonging to a reputed family. Mother, where is Kunjimalu? Not in the kitchen? - No. Then she may have gone to the garden to tie the cow. The company will provide security and the gardener. Shall we take Kunjimalu there to cook? Then who is there with mother? She will stay here till her marriage. When she leaves, we will give her some money. For all her help, what will we give? Only some of my old saris and... ...give some money as your contribution. How much are you planning to give? 25 or 30? Ratnam, what else to give? That much is enough. Seeing them afterwards would create uneasiness, right? Then avoid them soon. Till marriage, she can stay here with mother. Why should I avoid her? When you come here inquiring about mother, that... ...time you want another person here. I didn't get you. Dasan, you are an expert. Clever! No danger had happened. No rumour, no threat, no non-violent protest. Nothing... happened. Clever! You are very clever. Ratnam! Don't talk nonsense. Sometimes I think about men. May I say something for controversy? The logic you studied in B.A. has to be kept in its place. Sometimes I should be taken. Otherwise I will forget everything. Suppose, I had an affair before marriage and you came to know that. Then what would be your reaction? She is the servant. At any situation, there may be somebody to marry her. Now, you are feeling relieved, right? Oh! Now itself you started eating my brain. You terrible hypocrite. You have seen only humble servants. No. I saw college girls from good family who sleep with men if they get an opportunity. Money for studying! Job in foreign company! My father has given you all this. What? Dasan! What? What happened? If you fight like this, then what would be your future? I am informing at your house. You go from here. I am appointing another servant here. For caring about that person, I am here. Understood? Mother didn't tell anything. I am saying. Today onwards, I am deciding everything here. I heard. I will give the set of keys to you now itself. You keep it. And start ruling. Kunjimalu! Kunjimalu! Has she left? She won't go without informing me. There is one girl's dead body in the temple pond. Oh, my God! People are running towards temple pond. I thought educated people would know about all safety measures. Where are you all running? Come fast! Who is that? Do you know who that is? - No. She may jump into the pond at night. Otherwise, it won't come up now. - Is it? Who is that? - Who? Move! Move! Sharady and Sharasyar are still unconscious. She was so cruel. Who? Who had died? Ammini of Sharath house. "Life and death." "Life and death." Wait! Your friend had gone, right? "Those who enjoyed together, by saying stories..." "Due to rain, sunlight and darkness..." "They have left to different ways." "All are God's plays." "Those who enjoyed together, by saying stories..." "Due to rain, sunlight and darkness..." I am going. Who came from your house? Appukuttan. Has he not gone to make bread till now? Grandmother didn't allow him. What grandmother says is also right. Someone is needed to wash people's clothes, right? How is your grandmother? I am going. - Okay. Give me. Nice place, friend. - Come. Yes. Your mother left early. That is because she knew that I was coming. This is Prasad. He is an Engineer. - Hi. Engineer means he designs big hotels, buildings etc. What to say for that? Architect. Am I correct? Prasad is saying we can modify this house into a... ...hotel... a heritage hotel. We will get government's help too. Mother, the foreign tourists like bungalows of this type. I don't have any problem in that. I need only one room to stay. - Not now. I mean after grandmother's death. For that, a grave disease has to strike. Grandmother, you have to live some more time. Beneath that coconut there are parrots. Two mongooses usually come through this fence. It has three young ones. Waterfowl and its young ones come in the yard everyday. Lots of birds are there. Everyday morning, I wake up hearing their sounds. Don't cut trees. Do you like the voice of birds? Nothing will happen. Prasad got some idea when he saw this house. You went and prayed in the temple, right? Yes. I got a flower. That was blossomed yesterday. I don't know whose prayer it is. No one came to claim. So, priest had given that flower to me. This is for you. The flower has blossomed when you came here. I am having an old prayer. I felt sad when you left here. I prayed for your good life. That time I could do that only. Paru has left. That small girl is there. No information about the home nurse. Let them come as per their convenience. I will stay here with you. I am not in hurry. I have already informed my husband, Appukuttan. If you are feeling tired, come and sleep for sometime. Okay. "Oh, blue lotus!" "You have worn flowers..." "In my mind." "Oh, blue lotus!" "You made waves..." "...in river." "You have worn the bunch of peacock feathers. "...which I wished to see that day." "One day, I became wet in your tears." "Sun is far away from here. Oh, beauty, wake up slowly." "My eyes are twinkling to see you." "Oh, blue lotus." "You have worn flowers." "In my mind."
