[SLOW BLUEGRASS MUSIC PLAYING] [CLINKING] [GRUNTS] [GROANS AND GASPS] Oh! [SIGHS] Ah! [MOTORCYCLE REVVING] COMMENTATOR: And they're off. It's a fast start. Number six Bart Rhodes in the front, followed by number 11, Rick Hutchins. In third place from the Mitchell team, number 45, Paul Roman. And moving up in fourth, the Eagle, number 66, Frank Shelby. And in the second lap, Rhodes is holding the lead, but look at this. Frank Shelby is moving up on him. Third place. [ROCK 'N' ROLL MUSIC PLAYING] The Mitchell rider's gone down. Eddie Mitchell's team leader has lost his bike. [GRUNTS] Frank Shelby's gone off the track, and he's down hard. The yellow flag is up. We're waiting to see how serious the Eagle's been injured. It looks as if Frank Shelby's gonna be all right, folks. Whoo! Shades of 1981 is all on the National. [EXHALES] Next time, Eagle. You'll get 'em next time. [GRUNTING] Hey, Frank.Hi, Steph. You're late. We ran out of cash. You're gonna have to take a check. Oh, come on. A check? Mm-hmm. Wanna help me spend this? Sorry, Frank. The world's changed. MAN: Hey, Frank. Frank, got a minute? Hey, Francis, what's happening? Hey, man, give me a break. Okay, keep moving. Frank, Eddie wants his money. I gotta tell you. It's my new job now. Come on, Frank. Pay Eddie what you owe. Pay him something as an act of good faith. Damn, Frank. You owe Eddie. Come on. I'm not a traitor, Frank. Well, I'm gonna pay Eddie, Francis. 'Cause guess what's gonna happen? What? The Eagle and I are gonna win the Nationals. Hmm. National.

I'll be right back at her. Okay.Give me a second. Oh, yeah. Frank Shelby. [GROANS] [FRANK GROANS] Oh, God. [GROANS] Oh. BANK TELLER: I'll need some other form of ID, Mr. Shelby. Your driver's license is from out of state, and, uh, an American Motorcycle Association card isn't satisfactory. Guess I should see your supervisor. All right. Excuse me, ma'am. Hold on a sec. BANK TELLER: I need a check approved. SUPERVISOR: I'll have to get back to you tomorrow. BANK TELLER: It's this gentleman who's from out of state. SUPERVISOR: I'll take care of it. Mr. Shelby. Well, I'm amazed. You still got a driver's license. How you feeling?Huh? Your back's still sore? You look slightly better than you did last night. Flat tire. You stopped to help. You passed out. I fixed it. Anyway, it's the thought that counts. Thank you. [OBJECTS CLATTERING] Anybody know where I can get a bike fixed around here? [SHUTS CAR DOOR] Looks like you need a tune up. How's the back? Never better. Bull. My room ready? It's yours. Any idea how long? Long enough to get ready for the National. The National? Don't you just love it? I'm gonna clean up, drop some stuff off. Meet you at the cantina? You got it. Is that Frank Shelby? Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's Frank Shelby. [TENSE MUSIC PLAYS] COMMENTATOR: The biggest race of the year, the National Mile, thundering down toward a conclusion. And it's become a two-man battle. Jack Hayes and Frank Shelby, friends since high school, now just five laps away from the National Championship. What an unbelievable drama. What is going... Trouble, trouble in turn two. Hayes is down! Frank Shelby takes control... Whoa! And Shelby has rammed the back of Hayes' motorcycle. Frank Shelby tumbling on the back stretch after colliding with his best friend's bike. Unbelievable. [MOTORCYCLE REVVING IN DISTANCE] [UPBEAT COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING] Frank. Hey, Eddie. You Travis? That you back there, Francis? Frank, I want my money. Mo more talk. Just pay up. Serious? You're gonna beat me up? Yeah.For a lousy 2,000 bucks? Four.Two. Four.Two. You guys talking business? Jack, I've had it up to here with Shelby's crap. It's pay up time. They wanna beat me up, Jack? Oh, well. Then, it is business. I suggest another time, another place. Okay? Where this whole ugly matter can be handled reasonably, without all this animosity and temper. Okay, let me talk to Frank. I'm sure we can come up with a solution, Eddie, that you'll be comfortable with. Hey, stranger. Ginger, how you doing? I know what you're having, and I know what you want. Mm-hmm? Make it a double. How's Louise? Louise is fine. She says hi. I'm glad to hear that. Hey, you got yourself a team. Yeah. They any good?Yeah. Uh-huh.Yeah. Young, lot of potential. No screw-ups. Sponsors are interested, and you know, we could actually amount to something. Hmm. I'm outta here, too. Wanna get together and tell lies about the good ol' days? [SIGHS] Yeah. Yeah, I do. [EXCLAIMS] [GINGER LAUGHING] That was good, Frank. [DOOR RATTLES] Who's that? FRANK: That son of a... Morning, Frank.The hell are you doing? Maybe we should just go. [TRAVIS SNORTS] [FRANK GROANS] Oh! Gee, Frank. Why didn't you just pay 'em? Come on. GINGER: Frank! Get me up. Get me up.Oh! God! [GROANS] Follow my finger. I don't like the looks of that bump on your head. We're gonna have to run some tests. What do you want? I was looking at your tattoo. [MUTTERS] Where did you get that scar? Racing motorcycles. What happened? Did you crash or something? FRANK: Yeah, I crashed. Why don't you just shut up and leave me alone? What are you doing? It's okay, Mom. No, it is not okay. Why are you yelling at my son? Let's go. You have a concussion, Mr. Shelby. You need bed rest. When can I get back on a bike? Mr. Shelby... You know, I look at these X-rays, and I see a man with more broken bones than I've seen in a single human being before. Both arms, both clavicles, metal plates, the spine has been fused in three places. And those are the old injuries. I'm amazed that you can walk. And added to that, concussion. Bed rest.I heard you. When can I get back on a bike? Fine. The dizziness and stuff, that's gonna pass, ain't it? Perhaps, with bed rest. Thanks. KATHERINE: Danny? Danny? You all right? What are you doing? I'm doing a tattoo. You had good dreams? Yeah. I am so hungry. DANNY: Me, too.You are? This is good news. I'd like to hear this. Oh, man. Mom, do you have to go? Yeah, I gotta go home. Get my clothes, go to work. But it's Friday. Knock, knock. Who's there? Banana. Banana who? Knock, knock.Who's there? Banana.Banana who? Knock, knock.Who's there? Orange.Orange who? Orange you glad I didn't say "banana"? Oh. I want my horse. You got it. So, I will be back tonight, at 6:30. Have a good day. I love you. [INDISTINCT ANNOUNCEMENT OVER PA] Hey. How you doing? Well, I stopped by the gift shop, I got some stuff for you. Got, uh... Horses drinking at the lake. Zebras drinking at the lake. And I got you some bike magazines. This one here has got pictures of girls in it, so... You might wanna check 'em out before your mom sees 'em. Huh. That was your mom... wasn't it? Yeah. Well, I can do without her or your old man getting pissed at me. I don't have a dad. [SIGHS] You know, what happened the other day? Yeah. Okay. See ya. Are you going home? Yeah. JACK: Yeah, he's good. Real good. And he's aggressive, he's smooth. Main thing is, he needs more seat time. Yeah. But as far as marketing skills, he doesn't have a clue. [LAUGHS] You're gonna hate him. The guy you wanna look at is number 42. Hugh O'Neal. He's a kid. He's 22. There's not an ounce of fat on him. He's got great reflexes. And I got his bike, it's tuned out as he is. [MOTORCYCLE ENGINE ROARING] COMMENTATOR: Jack Hayes scrambling back for his bike. He wants to get his motorcycle back on two wheels. Hayes wants back in the race. Meanwhile, Shelby's thundering... Oh! Shelby has slammed into the back of Jack Hayes' bike. Shelby tumbling end over end, down the back stretch. A horrible crash. Out of turn, too. There's Hayes running to his fallen friend. The red flag flies, the race stops. Medical personnel rushing to the scene. What an irony. Jack Hayes will be the National Champion, Shelby will lose the crown, because he slammed into the back of his best friend's bike. JACK: Frank? Frank? God, you look old. Place has turned into something, Jack. Yeah. Yeah, it just kind of grew up on its own. You proud of this? Look, I, uh... I talked to Ginger. And I got your bike back. And then, I had a long talk with your doctor. Time to get off, Frank. Do something that's good for you. You know, for once in your life! [OBJECT RATTLES] [SIGHS EXASPERATEDLY] [EXHALES] I'm gonna go work on my bike. Get ready for the National. Well, that's a surprise. [INDISTINCT ANNOUNCEMENTS OVER PA] [SLOW BLUEGRASS MUSIC PLAYING] [COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING] Frank, you're drinking these things like they're water. Did you get divorced, or did you fall in love? I gotta go to the bank. I apologized to a kid, you know. It was, I don't know, stupid. Oh. Hey, Francis. What will it be? Francis, my man. Come on, have a seat. GINGER: You want something? Soda. Just soda. Thanks. No, no, no, no. Not a soda. Um, maybe, uh... Look, Frank. Come on, man. It was your fault, man. Just let it rot, will you, Frank? I mean, it's all finished now. And he's not angry anymore. So just... Just let it go, will you, man? No. Eddie ain't angry? Hmm. Trashed me. He trashed my bike. Let it go, Frank. I'm sorry, Frank. I never meant for you to get hurt. Shut up. Francis... Yeah, Frank. I told you to shut up. Hey, Frank. Just let it go. I'm sorry, Frank. I thought with Jack repaying Eddie, you know, you'd be okay with everything and all. You know... Frank! [FRANK MOANING] Oh... DOCTOR: Mr. Shelby, how are we feeling? [GROANS] Not too good is my guess. It's good to see you back. Although I hoped it would have been as an out patient. But, then, given your lifestyle, I doubt whether you would have followed through. Drink much, Mr. Shelby? Let me put it to you plainly. We're gonna keep you here for a few days. Tests, that sort of thing. [GROANS] Oh, God. Now the ribs have been re-damaged, and there's a deep bruise along the lower back. Site of the former injury. I'll check back with you later. Oh, one more thing, Mr. Shelby. Did you hit your head when you fell? No one at the bar seems to remember. Game is tight. Phoenix doesn't call time out, and Bart steals the inbound pass. He's into the corner with nowhere to go. And he lets loose with a fall away 15-footer. And it's good, and the Lakers win! Yay!FRANK: Nice shot. I probably would have missed it. Hey, you got a minute? Why don't you pull up a chair, sit down? [EXHALES] You get hurt racing again? Yeah. Yeah, a rookie took me out. How long are you here for? Couple days, I guess. I gotta do some tests and crap. How come you're still here? Same thing. Tests and stuff. Like a jail, ain't it? You've been in jail? Yeah. What's wrong with you? I don't know. What do you mean you don't know? Ain't they telling you? There's something wrong with my blood. Like what? It doesn't work right. Well, if it don't work right, you fix it. My bike breaks, I fix it. It's simple. What does your bike look like? I got a picture of the lady. Knock you right out. Hey, did you like the magazines I got you? Neat. Here. Feast your eyes on this. Wow, nice! Nice? Come on! That's as good as it gets. You called it the Eagle? Her. My bike, it's a lady. The Eagle. How fast does it go? Goes as fast as she wants to. Fast as I let her. You ever been to a race? No. Oh, man! Flat tracking is awesome. Sends the chill up and down my spine. It's like thunder, only all at once. And then, wham! Hits you right in the chest. Oh, you're gonna love it. Here, you take the Eagle. My mom might... What? Your mom might what? Wonder who the girl is. Huh. All right. That's cool. [GRUNTS] Thanks.Yeah. What's your name? Frank. Frank Shelby. Danny Barnes. Mm-hmm. Good to meet you, Danny. Can I call you Frank? Well, maybe. We'll see how it goes. Man, I'll tell you. If I start working out, I think I'll get myself ready for the National. Gotta get used to the pain, that's all. [INDISTINCT ANNOUNCEMENT OVER PA] Hey. Lookie here. Here, grab one. Yeah. Right down here, Danny. Come here. Afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Sacramento Mile. The king of the flat track racing circuit. Today's main event features a grudge match you've all been waiting for. It's Frank "The Eagle" Shelby... Thank you very much. Really appreciate it. Up against the rookie sensation of the season Danny, uh, what? The Outlaw. The Outlaw. Danny "The Outlaw" Barnes. Yeah! Ha! Hold on to your hats, ladies and gentlemen, this could be the race of the season. [CHILDREN LAUGH] A five lap dash for cash and bragging rights for life. Hey, kid. What's your name? Hold your hand up five seconds and then drop it. You're ready? Rev it up, man, rev it up. Go ahead. Go! Go! Yeah! Yeah! Attaboy! Good, good. Good, go! Accelerate. Take it inside. Inside. That's it. Smooth, smooth. Go, go, go! Yeah, move! Good! All right. All right. Take me down. And go, yeah! Yeah! Good one, good one. Watch the plant. Watch the plant. [LAUGHS] Yeah. Okay, now, go, go! Pull it up, Danny! Now let's do it. You got it! Easy! Find it, find it! Attaboy! Attaboy! Okay. Off course. Typical. Here we go. Come on, Danny, accelerate! You got it, man! Go! Go! Yeah! Yeah! Way to go, man! Hey! Way to go, bud. You won. [PANTING] Here. You deserve that, man. I'll trade you. Thanks, Frank. [CONTINUES PANTING] KATHERINE: So what am I supposed to say? That I'm scared? I'm worried? We were doing so great, Danny. And then, along comes this drunk, this bum. Frank's not a bum. The point is it's critical. It is important that you take care of yourself. I feel fine, Mom. I promise not to screw up. To be responsible. It's cool."It's cool"? You're starting to sound like him. Okay, Danny. We have an understanding, right? Okay. Give me five. The latest cycle of drugs hasn't improved Danny's condition. His white cell count is still way up. So what now? We'd like to start the new therapy. When? Tomorrow. Every time you try something new, he gets worse. He's been through so much. We keep trying. Yeah, I know. Okay, I'll tell him. JACK: Switched to coffee?Yeah. National. Been training. Oh, yeah. I forgot. Well, if you get this thing running, maybe bring it out to the track. Show my boys how it shouldn't be done. Thanks, Jack. Excuse me. Mr. Shelby? Good. Very good. Jack Hayes. Katherine Barnes. Nice to meet you. Well, I'll-I'll leave you to Mr. Shelby. Once he starts talking you can't shut him up. Nice to meet you, Mrs... Ms. Barnes. Ms... Whatever. [LAUGHING] Oh, shit. JACK: Mr. Shelby. Is Mr. Shelby... So, Mr. Shelby... This is where you work? Kind of. Yeah. Yeah. I wanna talk to you about Danny. He likes you very much. I'm sure you know that. What you don't know is how much your little race the other day affected him. He's very ill, Mr. Shelby. He's taking a medication which restricts his physical capabilities. If he had fallen, or hit something hard, the results could have been disastrous. And, as it is, he's very weak, anemic. Uh, do you understand what I'm telling you? Yes, I do. Thank you. Dr. Dailey tells me that you are one of his out patients. I suppose you'll be visiting the hospital? Danny would like to see you again. If you do visit him, please, no games, no physical activity. All right? Sure. Well, thank you for your time. Would you say goodbye to Mr. Hayes for me? Sure. Oh, I-I have one more favor to ask you. When you see Danny, will you watch your language around him? He's starting to sound like you. Goodbye. Kind of classy for you. You think so? What the hell's he doing? [COUGHING] MAN: Getting in shape to kick your butt. Kind of pathetic. [FRANK CONTINUES COUGHING] [COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING] [MOTORCYCLE ROARING] [WOMAN SINGING INDISTINCTLY] ♪ You'll have shoes Of silver ♪ Shoes of bright green leather ♪ Ribbon to tie Your hair with ♪ And a ring for every finger ♪ I know where you go ♪ And I know who's Gone with you ♪ [SIGHS DEEPLY] Oh! I used to sing to her before she was sick. Mm. When she was scared and she'd have bad dreams. There was so much life here. [SNIFFLING] So much hope. I believed she would get better. So much life in this place. [SOBS] Katherine... do you think it's true? What? Do you think it's true that they stay? I mean, could she still be here? Maybe she's at home. She'd want her toys. [SOBBING] [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] Hi. How long has he been asleep? The nurse just gave him his shot ten minutes ago. He's a great kid. You should be proud. I am. Let's go for coffee. Oh, uh... No, I should... [SNIFFLES] I'll have you back here in 20 minutes. Promise. He was diagnosed 18 months ago. And the first series of chemo worked really well. He went into remission for a year. And, uh, then a few months ago, cancer cells came back. And nothing they seemed to try does any good. And now they're trying something new. If that doesn't work... He's one of a kind. What? He's one of a kind. He's got a gift. Those are the ones that make it. Well, if it were that simple, Mr. Shelby, half the beds in this hospital would be empty, and you would be a millionaire. Danny's fought. He's refused to give up. But after a little while, you need a little help. I mean, he can't just make himself better 'cause he wants to get better. [SIGHS] We're talking about cancer, Mr. Shelby, not a common cold. Would you call me Frank? All right. Danny's got help. He's got more than most. He's got you. And you gotta want it for him. You can't give up. You don't know what the hell you're talking about. You don't have any idea about the time, and the care, and the prayers. Don't you dare pass judgment on me or Danny, because you are totally ignorant of the people and the circumstances involved, Frank. You're right. I don't know you. But me and Danny, we got something going. It's a man thing. I know what it's like to live with pain. And I know that the pain can get so bad that dying seems like the only solution. Now, all I wanna do is spend a little time with your son. Just get to know him. No racing, no swearing. Just parts. That's... That's okay. Thanks. [STAMMERS] I'm gonna go see Danny. It's my pleasure. Thanks for the time. You. You gotta get lower in turn two. Groove is down there. You gotta go hunt for it. I want you guys to start pressing each other. That's why it's called "racing." Five more laps. Let's go. [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING] Go get 'em, you old dog. [CHUCKLES] Yeah, this one I got in Peoria. I had a blowout. Going down the front straight and then I skidded, I don't know, maybe 50 feet down. I'd have been okay, but a rookie ran over me. And then, this one here... You see that? I got that in Castle Rock. I hit the wall. Back straight doing about 130. Did it hurt much? Heck yeah it hurt. Hi. Danny has to go to sleep for this procedure. But you can stay until then. All right. Hi. Do you want me to turn this on? Here we go. Frank, you ever get scared? Yeah. I think everybody's scared of something, Dan. I know that's why I do what I do. It's why I race. I mean... I was at the shop, I was trying to figure out what to bring you. I kinda wanted to bring you something. Your mom told me what was gonna be going on, so I brought you the Eagle. She, uh... She's a hood ornament on my '51 Ford truck for a long time, about 20 years. We traveled across the country together, and we did a lot of new things for the first time. And, uh... I got busted up, was in the hospital, and the doc said I'd never ride again. I wanna tell you, young man, that was the scariest time of my life. All I had was her, so I just picked her up and I just held her tight. [SIGHS] And I believed with all my heart that one day I'd ride again. And you did. You damn betcha... Darn right I did. I'll tell you something. I think it should work for you. Just hold her real tight, Danny. Just believe with all your heart. I give you my word, the eagle will protect you. You and her just riding it. [SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING] [GROANS IN PAIN] Staring seemed to help, huh? [SIGHS] [GRUNTS] Yeah. What's on your mind, part? History. My friend... You pay these little visits, you know. Come around, clean up. Race... And you go back to whatever hell you cook up for yourself. That's what you've been doing since you got busted up. And watching you yesterday, riding like the Eagle, flying in the field... Time was that it brought tears to my eyes. I mean it. Like a living dream, Frank. Now, I-I... I just get a sort of sad feeling, 'cause I don't know who I'm watching. The man you wanna be, the man who was... I just stopped believing a long time ago it's the man you are. But you fooled me. You... You show up this time, and get drunk, screw up. All the bad luck hanging on you like always. But something's different. I can't put my finger on it, but you're different. I mean, a part of me is sayin', "Watch out, Jack, he... "He's gonna burn you big." I don't believe I ever heard you say thank you to me in all the years I've known you. And I've never known you to be kind. But I heard you say, "Thanks, Jack." And there is a kindness in you, Frank, I've never seen before. Part of me is believing again. [BLUES MUSIC PLAYING] [CHILDREN YELLING AND PLAYING] Hey. [TOOLS CLATTERING] FRANK: Francis... You could cough or something, you know. You scared the hell out of me. I'm like a cat. Silent. Walking on velvet pads. Hey, is this a kid's bike? Yeah. For a friend. Is this gonna be a small version of your bike? Yeah. Thought so! Thought so. Yeah, man, I... I think I know what's going on here. Something wonderful is about to happen. It's a good idea, Frank. This is a fine idea! Hey, Francis... You know, the other day at the bar, when I trashed you... I'm sorry. No offense. Didn't hurt. Didn't have any Frank power behind it. It was kind of weak like. Of course, you were drunk. [SIGHS HEAVILY] Frank... She wants me to find her heart. She said you're too busy. Yeah. I would really appreciate that, Francis. Okay. Done deal. [EXHALES] You... You look good, Frank. Thinner. Uh-oh. You're losing some hair on the top there, though. Hey, how old is this kid? No, don't tell me. Don't tell me. She'll tell me. Oh, it's good to talk with you, Frank. It's real good to talk with you. Oh, it's been too long. [FRANCIS CHUCKLES] Hey, I'll probably have something for you in a day or two, all right? I got myself a blender. I don't know. You think it's too California? Ah... Sort of like it used to be, huh, Frank? [INAUDIBLE] Hi. Hi. Kate, uh, I'd like to take you to dinner tonight. Oh, Frank... Thank you, but Danny expects me at the hospital every night. I'll pick you up at the hospital. 7:30? Danny's gonna be resting by then, and... Come on, I promise to have you back at 9:00 sharp. Thank you, but no. What kind of food do you like? What?Food. What kind of food do you like? See, I need to know in order to make a reservation. I mean, fancy's okay, but not too fancy, all right? Yeah.Great. I'll see you at 7:30. Bye. You know, the fancy... I don't have a suit. [ROCK 'N' ROLL MUSIC PLAYING] Come on. Let's roll with it. Mom... [VOCALIZING] You're more excited about this than a Lakers game, aren't you? You're making me nervous. I want you to have a great time. Have some fun. I mean, don't spill stuff. And don't make him mad. Don't worry abut me and then leave early. Have dessert, stay out. Go to a movie. And? You gotta talk about bikes at some point. Bring 'em up over coffee or something. Just drop a comment like, Team Harley lost John Forbes. Or that you heard Randy Lewis had a European sponsor. Wait a minute. Hold on. I don't even know what you're talking about. It doesn't matter, Mom. It shows you're interested. That makes him interested. Well, it is just dinner. Okay, maybe that's too technical. [SIGHS] This is better. Come on, pay attention, Mom. I am listening to your every word. Tell him that you heard me talking about the Nationals. Ask him about how important they are. That's good, 'cause if he starts talking about 'em, you'll know what to ask. Okay, I will do my best. I promise. I will have a great time. I will not spill anything. I will try to say something halfway intelligent about motorcycles. And I will be back here at 9:00 sharp, okay? Mom...What? Do you like him? What?Do you like Frank? You do like him. When you come back, could you bring Frank? I wanna show him something. Sure. I'll ask him. You are the neatest kid in the world, you know that? I love you. Mom... You look fantastic. Bye. Bye. KATHERINE: He was a gift. We'd been trying to have a baby for a long time, and when Danny came out, he was perfect... [CHUCKLES] Distinct. It was Danny. And then he... He got sick and Steven couldn't handle it. So he left. Did you love him? I did. Yeah, I think so. What about you? Have you ever been in love? [SIGHS] No. Hmm. Would you like another drink? Yes, thank you. Oh, my God! I don't believe this! Oh, I'm so... [CHUCKLES] I used to spill stuff all the time. Oh, um... I know what I wanted to ask you. I wanted to ask you about the National. Shoot. Um... Is it important? Yeah. [MARIACHI MUSIC PLAYING] Would you like to dance? Ah! So... Hi. How are you feeling? Okay.You okay? Yeah. One for you, and one for me. How are you doing, my man? Hey, Mom, could I talk to Frank for a minute? In private? Sure. I'll take a little walk. These are my mom's tools. But she lets me use 'em. I did this. It's kinda hard to tell it's a horse. I got better on this one. This is nice. This is my best one. This is beautiful work, Danny. You should be proud of him. I carved him 'cause I was afraid. He doesn't look afraid, does he? Well... You can't tell for sure. I mean, he don't look afraid. Again, that can fool you. I bet if you was to ask him, he'd tell you he was afraid of something. Like what? Well, I don't know. Being alone. Growing old. Maybe the fear that... That one day fear is gonna replace your courage. He got a name? I haven't thought of one. I think if you wanna find out what he's afraid of, you gotta ask him. I know what I'd call him. Kind of looks like him, too. What? Danny. What the hell do you think is going on here? Trivia? Play time? You don't even know what a ratchet is, so, please, don't go near the lady. Y'all understand? MAN: Who says?FRANCIS: "Who says"? "Who says"? What's that supposed to mean? Who says? Who says? Who says? Who says? I don't know who says. God sakes. FRANK: Francis, what's going on? Tell 'em, Frank. Tell 'em please not to touch it. They know zilch. I come in, final tune, Frank. Final tune. And they're all hovering around it like buzzards. Just wanted to help. FRANCIS: You know what I'm saying, Frank. Francis is Chief Wrench, you gotta check with him first. Look, Francis... Mr. Bartley, rookie. Mr. Bartley, we'd like to help. Who says? MAN: You name it, we'll do it. Any pointers you could give us, we'd appreciate. We just wanna be part of this. Let me think about it. Now you boys get out of here for now. Let me ruminate. Come on, you guys. That's pretty well done. You're learning. Little bit at a time. They will appreciate her. Thank you, Francis. [SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING] FEMALE DOCTOR: He had the attack 40 minutes ago. We've medicated him. Okay, right away, let's get him to ICU. Did you open up the IV? MALE NURSE: Yes. We'll take good care of him. [INDISTINCT CONVERSATION] [INDISTINCT ANNOUNCEMENT OVER PA] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] I feel so helpless. [SIGHS DEEPLY] I wanna be with him. I need to be with him. He wants me to give you this. [EXHALES] If he dies, I wanna be there. I wanna catch his spirit. [SOBBING] DANNY: Hey, Frank. I wanted to give you the wings earlier, but they weren't done. I figured since you gave me yours, you'd need some for the Nationals. Hope you like 'em. I wanna ask you a favor, Frank. My mom, I think, really likes you. And just in case something happens to me, I was hoping you could take care of her. Don't tell her, or... But just in case. Thanks, Frank. Hey, guess what? I got to know Danny, like you said. Where'd you learn that trick? Your pal, Danny. [MONITOR BEEPING] [SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING] Is this what you want? [SIGHS HEAVILY] There you go. Just let him live. Just let him live. [SNIFFLING] Just let him live. Please. Please. Katherine. He's better. He's weak, but he's better. Katherine, I love you. All right. What a job you did on that breakfast. I got a secret. What?Promise not to tell? You get to go back to your own room this afternoon. Honest?Honest. Knock, knock. Who's there? Me. [CHUCKLES] [BLUEGRASS MUSIC PLAYING] COMMENTATOR: Jack Hayes trying his best to get that motorcycle back on its wheel. Meanwhile, the team leader, Frank Shelby, thundering on. I don't think he sees the yellow flag. All he can see is the National Championship waiting at the end of one more lap. Whoa! Shelby has rammed the back of Hayes' motorcycle. Frank Shelby, end over end, tumbling down the back stretch. An incredible finish to the National Mile. And what an irony. Hayes is gonna be the National Champion, and Shelby will finish his season face down on the back stretch. So my folks took him in, and-and we became like-like brothers. And, uh, we raced in Europe together, and we raised a lot of hell. [LAUGHS] Right. And then he had his accident. And, uh, he was out for a few years. By the time he got back, I'd gotten married and had my first kid, and he, uh, just kept going downhill. Until he ran into you and Danny. Now he's got something he actually cares about. So, what time do you want us there? Well, um... I figure the main starts about 3:00, so we'll pick you up a quarter after 2:00? Okay.And, uh, things should be real comfortable for you and Danny. Thank you, Jack. No, thank you. You asked me to take care of your mom in case something happened to you. Let me tell you. I'm gonna do that. But I want you to be there, Dan. I want you and me to do it together. And the second thing is, it's gonna be my last race tomorrow. And it would be an honor to me, it would be a privilege if... I could wear your colors out there. [SIGHS] That way, it will be like the Barnes-Shelby racing team. I got your old bandanna. I'll put it on my arm. And you and me will be out there together. What do you say? [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING] Just like old times, huh, Frank? Holy mackerel! You better stay out of the sun. You don't have much hair on the top of your head. You could get melanoma or warts or something. Let's go to work. [INAUDIBLE] Ladies and gentlemen, we welcome you to the fastest motorcycle dirt track anywhere on the planet. It is the Mile National, and the numbers are by far 130 mile an hour straightaway speed. Twenty-five laps of a mile as the 12 master riders from this terrific field assemble here today. And here's how they'll line up. Ladies and gentlemen, number one, the emblem of the National Champion, Chris Carr. [CROWD CHEERING] Chris Carr's rival, number two, Sean Parker. The man who has won the National Mile more times than anyone else, always the big favorite of the fans. He carries number nine, ladies and gentlemen, the Springer, Jay Springsteen. [CROWD CHEERING] And what a pleasant surprise. Starting fourth on the field today, put your hands together and welcome back one of the toughest, and certainly the oldest rider in the field today, ladies and gentlemen, the Eagle, Frank Shelby. [LOUD CHEERING] Here we go. COMMENTATOR: Talk about tension in the air. The engines rev, the bikes' into gear, and here comes the start. Green, and we're underway. Starts to turn one. Chris Carr, Scott Parker jump out front with Ricky Graham. Jay Springsteen sits at fourth spot. Looks like Scott Haley eighth, and Frank Shelby out back bringing up the rear. Working their way through this first lap, they're still all bunched up, I guarantee they'll stay that way all day. [YELLING INDISTINCTLY] Open up the throttle! Open up the throttle! They go to the back stretch out of turn two. What a battle for eight place! The veteran Frank Shelby, and the kid Scott Haley. Look at them! They're close. Come on!Come on, Frank! Let's go! Frank Shelby's got a great run going here. He's picked up another spot. Shelby is up to sixth place. What a great ride! Yes! Chris Carr leads with running back all bunched up as they grapple down the back strip. Frank Shelby is the guy on the move. He's around Hugh O'Neal. The Eagle is in the fourth spot. And he's headed for the third. Unbelievable! Come on! Yes! Yeah!Yes, come on! COMMENTATOR: Just two laps to go! Here's Jay Springsteen making his move. And what a shocker! Frank Shelby has come right with him. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] Go! Go, Frank, go! Frank, go! Frank, go! Come on, Frank! Go! COMMENTATOR: In the final lap, it's a two-man battle, ladies and gentlemen. Incredible! Jay Springsteen with six Mile National wins. And in hot pursuit, can you believe it? Frank Shelby! After all the years and all the troubles, he's back on top, chasing down Springsteen for the lead. Here they come, down the final track for the final time. Twenty-five miles racing... [LOUD CHEERING] [COMMENTATOR CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY] But look at Frank Shelby! He's handle bar to handle bar with Springsteen as they gun for the checkered flag. He's done it! Shelby has won. [LOUD CHEERING] ...unbelievable finish. Frank Shelby wins the National Mile... [COMMENTATOR CONTINUES SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] [LOUD CHEERING] [CHEERING CONTINUES] Yeah! Yes! Yeah! Yeah!
