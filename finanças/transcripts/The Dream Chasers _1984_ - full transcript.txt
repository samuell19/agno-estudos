Herbie! Come on, Herbie, we better go. Herbie! Coming, Mom! Come on, we're late. Ah! One hat at a time, Herbie. Okay, Mom. My name is Butch. Butch Cassidy, ma'am. Yes, sir, Mr. Cassidy. All right, Dad's here! Oh, good, you're home early. Oh! Hey, big guy. What are you two up to? I'm taking Mr. Cassidy to the clinic. Why don't you take me, Dad? Then we can plan our trip to Wyoming. Please! Hey, that's a great idea. Herbie, I can't. I just came home to pick up some papers and I've got to shoot right back down to the office. You never take me, Dad. Hey, we'll play some ball after dinner. Promise, huh. Come on, Herbie, get your bike. Okay, Mom. Herbie! You brat! I see you! Women. Hiya, giddy up there, hiya. Whoo-hoo! Hiya, pardner, Telford! Hiya, pardner! How you doin'? Herbie, get back in here. Herbie? Herbie, careful. Herbie! HERBIE: Yahoo! Hey, you make every shot count now, huh? Every shot count. HERBIE: Yahoo! Hiya, giddy up there. Hiya. Whoo-hoo! You make every shot count now, huh? See you back at the ranch! Whoopee! Would this go by the window? Needs a lot of work. I don't know, that's the charm of it. You don't want to fancy it up too much. How much for this icebox? $600. You're kidding. I wouldn't kid about a thing like that. Yeah, but it hasn't been restored. I mean... Restored? Restored to what? Well, look at it. Half the hardware is missing. Oh, hardware. No buts about it, that's $600. Look, there's a crack. Honey. Right here, right through the door. You probably want to put booze in this thing. Don't you? Huh? Is that right? Yeah. I thought so. See, Mrs. Deerfield kept milk in here for her six kids. She didn't believe in drinking. How am I, in good conscience, going to sell you this icebox knowing full well you're going to fill it with whiskey? It ain't right. She's dead, isn't she? Not in my mind, she isn't. Honey? Come on, honey, let's get out of here. He's strange. He's a bit weird. How's business, Telford? It's good, Lyles, real good. Heard you sold something. No, just a layaway. Huh! We're ready, Herbie. Hi, Herbie. I'll be with you in a sec. Butch. Butch. - Er, Herbie... - I mean Butch. You can't wear that gun. Er, Butch, the hat, too. All right. Now hold still, Herbie. All right, don't wiggle your toes. Cassidy! Herbie, put your head back. Herbie, put your head back. Herbie, you've got to hold still. Mrs. McGrath, if it looks like we've got it under control, perhaps we can reduce the frequency of his visits here. We'll just have to play it by ear. Hi, honey.Hi. Honey, if you feel all right, why don't you get your bike out of the back of the car and start your paper route? I want to talk to the doctor for a minute. Okay, Mom. I... I know what you're going through, and I... Well, I just don't have all the answers. Some days he has the energy of two 11-year-olds and other days he can't even get out of bed. I know. I know. Well, thank you, Dr. Garson. You're welcome. Darcy, check this out. You're gonna get hurt if you keep showing off, Herbie. I wasn't showing off, Darcy. There was rattlesnakes everywhere. Huh? Yeah, they were all the way up to my handle bars. One was even crawling up my pant leg. Ah! Yeah. I had to squash him before he bit me. Oh, Herbie, you and your day dreams. Come on, Darcy, let's go for a ride. You know what, Darcy?What? You're the prettiest girl on the block. Herbie, I'm the only girl on the block. Whoopee! Pony express. Watson, grab the phone. Mr. Bell. Mr. Bell, is that you? Sure is. Watson, we're making history. Pretty soon we'll have all these stupid sons of bitches putting quarters in these boxes. Dad! Watch your language, he's just a child. Hell, I learned to talk that way from the kid. Didn't I, Butch? Butch, isn't that right? Well... Yeah! It's the damn truth, ma'am. My father has a lot of wonderful qualities, Herbie, but language is not one of them. Only ignorant people swear. Wait a minute. But... It's me... It's my fault, ma'am. Well, if you're going to be a bad influence on my father maybe you better play someplace else. I'm almost finished with the bookkeeping, Dad. Hmm. I'm afraid Jeff is going to have to check them over again. All that just because the stupid sons... Where's my paper? I'll be right back. Well... Here we are. Let's see. Ah, the Russians are at it again, look at that. Wish to the devil George C. Scott was running things. Uh-oh. Enemy. Enemy! Lock the door. Hmm. Come on, Telford, open up. Nancy! Come on, Telford. Honestly, Father. You're really juvenile. Hey, Telly, did I tell you my dad's taking me to Wyoming? Wyoming? Hey, Wyoming. That's a wonderful state. Listen, you remind me to tell you the time I hunted grizzlies up in the Big Horns there. You hunted grizzlies in Wyoming? Ho, ho, ho. I hunted them, I fought them, I skinned them alive. Yes, sir, Butch, believe me. Oh, come on, Telford, don't tell the boy wild stories. You've never been out of Cleveland in your life. Jeff, that was uncalled for. I don't think he should be telling the boy wild stories. Tell me about Wyoming tomorrow, okay, Telly. I'm sorry, Dad. Well, I gotta go. Hey, hey. Where are you going? I think Billy Graham is on. Billy Graham? Billy Graham? Now, see what you did. Billy Graham. The kid's gonna go and be a priest. Herbie and I were playing football this afternoon out in the front yard, and he collapsed at my feet. He's so weak. Robert, did you hear what I said? He can't even play a five-minute game of football. Don't worry about him, he's going to be okay. Lighten up. You just won't accept the facts, will you? The facts. You want to know the facts? Okay. Fact, they did catch it early. Fact, the treatments are working. Fact, he has stabilized. My God, Kathy. The first cloud on the horizon, you make a hurricane out of it. Look, he's going to be fine. Sure. Every human being on the face of the Earth has been subject to disease and death. Some of us are subjected to even severe suffering. Maybe even... Hey, slugger. How was your day? Play ball with the guys? Knock a couple over the left field fence? I was at the clinic, Dad. Well, play some catch after dinner, huh? I already played with Mom. Herbie, Robert! So Colter was a mountain man. And his bones was rattling. Were rattling. Were rattling inside of him, he was so hungry. So, Colter ate a buffalo chip. He was that hungry. Got him through though. Well, what's a buffalo chip? Now, honey, I wouldn't bother. You're kidding. She doesn't know what a buffalo chip is? Well, that's why I'm asking. Mom, you really don't know what a buffalo chip is? Sorry, I don't think you want to know over dinner. Herbert T. McGrath, you tell me now, I do want to know. It's a gigantic cow dump. A huge cow dump. Oh! They get baked hard in the summer. Well, mountain men like Colter get so hungry... It's just like a dark pancake lying on the prairie. Enough, Herbie. You just pick one up, plop it on in your mouth. All right, Herbie. Of course, it's not as good as your chicken, honest, Mom, really. Thanks a lot, I was worried there for a minute. That Colter... He was some guy, huh, Dad? Yeah, he was some guy. Hmm. He was terrific. I think we ought to have him over for dinner. Well, you wanted to know. Didn't she, Dad? Excuse me. Yeah.You're excused. Incredible stroke of luck. Now that we've picked up the antique shop, I have half a block. Antique shop? Antique shop. Herbie hangs out down there. Well, the old man wasn't paying his bills. We close the deal next week. Next week? Robert. You've been promising Herbie that Wyoming trip for months. Can't you put your business off? I can't put it off. This thing can't be put on the back burner. But his trip, it's so important to him. It's all he talks about. This is a very complicated case, believe me. So, Wyoming's off, huh? Right. You lied. You promised me and you lied! Way to go, hotshot. Thanks a lot. I want to go to Wyoming. Look Herbie, we'll go next spring. I don't want to go next spring, I want to go now. I can't do that. You lied. You always do that. You make promises and then you lie. Herbie, look, I have other responsibilities. You promised! You promised! You promised! Stop it, Herbie! You promised! You promised! You promised! How dare you? Herbie, I'm sorry. It's my job, Kathy. You still miss your dog, don't you? Yeah. Yeah, me, too. Herbie, I... I'm sorry about what happened earlier. I'm sorry about Wyoming. Hey, we'll get another dog and we'll all take the trip to Wyoming next spring. Okay? Look, I know you're disappointed. It's... It's just... I want to do the best job I can to provide for you and Mom. I'm the one that's dying, Dad. Herbie. Come on, let's go. The game starts in five minutes. Grab your bike, we need you at shortstop. Okay, okay, I'm coming. Oh, Herbie. Herbie! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it. It's okay. Okay. It's okay. It's okay. Telly. Telly? Telly? Telly? Telly? Telly. Gotcha. You scared me, Telly. Well, you better be scared because I'm going to cut out your gizzard and I'm going to feed it to the dogs. Telly, people don't have gizzards. Well, I'll cut out your liver. Oh, duel to the death, huh? Ah! Ah! Wait! Oh! Hey, hey, hey. We didn't want to, Dad. My shop? You can't take my shop. It's my life. We, uh, couldn't make the payments any longer. Well, wait a minute. Who's taking my shop? Sloan and uh, McGrath. Butch? Butch, wait a minute. Don't leave. It's not your fault, Butch! I need you, Butch. Herbie, I got tickets for the baseball game, Saturday. Herbie? What are you doing? I can't stand you! Where is he? What's the matter? All right, Herbie, I don't know what the hell your problem is. What's going on? Why did you do that, huh? Answer me. Somebody tell me, what is it? What is it? What is it? You tell her, Herbie. No, wait, I'll tell her. He stormed into my study and he started throwing my books everywhere. You talk to him. I don't seem able to get through. He stole Telly's shop. Robert, calm down. You're over reacting. Over reacting? He destroyed my study. You stole Telly's shop. You're a thief. Don't you ever talk like that to me. Robert, stop it! What are you talking about? Are you talking about the antique store? Yeah. He stole it from Telly. Robbed him! Okay. All right. I get it, I get it, Herbie. Herbie, I'm sorry for your friend. But he didn't live up to his responsibilities. He owed people money. People should always live up to their responsibilities, huh, Dad? Yeah. Right. Like Wyoming, huh, Dad? Telly! Telly! Telly! Herbie. Telly! Enough. What is wrong, Herbie? Telly! Now stop that now. You're gonna break the glass. Let me go! Telly! Telly! I said stop that now. Herbie, what's wrong? Telly! Hey! Telly. Let me go! You touch that kid again, you'll be singing soprano at the opera! Dad! I'm not helping him move! Oh! Where you going, Telly? Well, Butch, they're... They're sending me away to die. Going to the old age home. Land of the stumbling dead. Jeff, would you come in and help me please? I guess this is it, Butch. End of the trail. Final sunset. Dad! They're waiting for you. We're... We're ready to go. Dad? I'm not deaf! Just wanna make some old friends comfortable, before I leave. Dad. I wanna die. Oh, Dad! Think I will. Why don't you leave? Just, both of you, go. Close the door and lock it after you. I'll be dead in three days. A skeleton in seven. Dad, what is the matter with you? What the hell are you doing? Why did you do that? You know you're gonna need those this afternoon. How do you work this thing? Listen, I know how you're feeling and I feel very, very badly for you. But I am sick and tired of your treating me like a fool. I mean, you... You think I'm stupid, don't you? I sure do! Yeah, well, I paid for these and you're gonna wear 'em. Jeffery!Hey! Honest to God, Nance, I try. I really do. I'm patient, I'm even-tempered, but sometimes your father... Sometimes he... You really piss me off! Jeffrey Bauman, I am surprised at you! Oh, I am, too! Well, it's the truth. Admit it, Telford, you've always, always had it out for me! He thinks I'm stupid. Well, let me tell you something, pops! I am summa cum laude from Brandeis. Summa! Summa! Summa! That is not a stupid man! Summa! I think we better take me to the home. Summa! Summa! Summa, Telford! Summa! Summa! Jeffery! Why don't you shut up? Summa, Telford! Everybody will think there's a Japanese wrestler loose in here. Old fart! Wyoming. You can't take us all. It's over for you, Cassidy. Seems like a nice place. Let's move on to something else. It's very clean, Dad. And, you know, the library and the reception area, I didn't notice that this afternoon. Oh, whoopee! Well, we'll talk about it this weekend. You do remember that you're coming this weekend? Yeah. What's the matter with him? It's a very nice place. Never mind. Hello.Hello. So, how was dinner, Dad? I hear the food's pretty good. It'll pass. Oh, come on, Telford, she's just trying to be nice. We wanna help you. Help? That's what everybody's trying to do, help. Here, look at this. "Today is Friday. Weather is sunny. "Next holiday is Halloween." Okay. Oh! Look at that. What do we have here? "Next meal is breakfast." Well, some people need to know these things. Yeah, like you, for instance. I'll be suffocated with help here. "The next person you see tomorrow morning will be yourself." "Your next bowel movement will be precisely in two hours." Dad! Oh, it's a duck farm here! Duck farm! Who needs your help? Got plenty of help. I can take care of myself. Duck farm! Trying to help! That's what it is, a duck farm! I want my money. You mean close out your account? Yup. May I ask why? No, ma'am. Just cough it up, $100. Yes, sir. 20, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100. Keep that for your record. This is where we're going, Telly. Hole in the Wall. And we'll just be gone for a couple of weeks. Then we can come right back, okay? Ah, it ain't gonna work, Butch. Why not? I mean, we can rob a bank. And... And shoot grizzly bear. Please, Telly? Well, I promised Nancy and bozo brain I'd come over for the weekend. Please, Telly? Besides, Wyoming is not what it used to be. McDonald's all over the place. There aren't any grizzly bears left there anymore. Jeff says you've never been out of Cleveland in your life. Who the hell are you gonna believe? Me or him? I told you I fought grizzlies in Wyoming. I'm sorry my dad took your shop. Well, not your fault. I'm going anyhow. With or without you. Butch... Well, all right. Maybe. I'll tell you what. In the alley, tomorrow night, behind my shop. If I'm there, I'm going. If I'm not, I'm not. Okay. Oh, my God! You scared me, Telly! Its Hole in the Wall or bust! All right! We're going! Sure you got enough gas? Oh! Oh! Compliments of my son-in-law. Climb aboard! All right! Climb aboard! Let's go! Here we go! Yoo-hoo! Telly, look out! Ooh! Wow! Doggone drunk! This thing sounds bad. It hasn't been out of the garage in two years. Telly, you just ran a red light. Huh? Well, maybe if it'd stop raining, I could see a thing. You just ran another red light! Well, it takes a while to get the hang of things. Telly, I don't wanna get thrown in jail in Cleveland. Well, maybe we better get off the main drag, huh? Oh, my God! Dear God, no! What's the matter? Herbie's gone! What? He's gone! I'll call the police. ♪ Whoopee ti yi yo, 'git along little dogies ♪ You know that Wyoming will be your new home ♪ I said I'm sorry. I didn't mean to run out of gas. I think somebody drained my tank. Honestly, Jeffery, I told Dad that we'd be here by 8:00. I don't see what the big deal is, we just saw him yesterday. It's a rough time in his life. He hates me. If that's what makes him happy. I will. I know. I tried to call you, but no answer. What happened? Well, I don't know how to say this, but... Dad. Is it Dad? Oh, no! He's not, um... Oh, no, it's not that, he's all right. He ran away last night. Oh, no! He what? Hey, you feelin' all right, Butch? Look a little pale. Homesick, eh? Gee no! My home's on the range. Evenin'. Evenin'. Might as well fill her up. Don't move, mister! Don't move a muscle. Get the keys to the register, Sundance. Will you put that thing down? Go on and do what you have to do, piddle. Where's the bathroom, sir? Inside the store, son. Get back there and don't move! I'll blow your head off! I got a boy about the same age. Kids get the darndest notions nowadays. Yeah. Dadgum it. Lousy transmission. Sounds like my mother's old washing machine. Well, it... No sense in taking chances. We better go back, check it out. Plenty of place to turn here. Butch, go inside and get that guy out here, will ya? Mister? Is anybody here? Ow! One peep out of you and you're dead! Now get that old man in here, quick! Telly! Telly! Hurry, Telly, I need ya! Please don't hurt him, mister. Shut up, dummy! Butch? Butch... Hold it right there, old man! I want all of it. Every last penny. I don't have anything, mister. Don't tell me that! Come on, get up against there. All right, take what you want, but don't hurt my boy please. Just don't hurt my boy!Please, mister. Mister, please!Is that it? Boy, I oughta... Please! Tough guy, huh? Well, maybe I can use you. What are you talking about? Leave that boy alone! Shut up! I need a partner. Robbing gas stations and banks. Yeah, I think he'll work out just fine. Look at him, he even looks like a bank robber. No, I don't! Is he smart? No, please, Telly. I flunked math. Well... Yeah, yeah, he is smart. I have to admit that. I am not! I don't even know my times tables, mister! Flunked math! Hell, you couldn't even count the money! Try to follow me and I'll blow your heads off. Butch, quick. Get in the car. Tell your nephew he did a great job! It was worth the 20. Glad to help out. All right. Well, we didn't come out of that too bad. Eh, he was in such a hurry, he only got 20. We can make that up easy when we hit the bank in the next town. What do you mean? A hold up! Oh, sure. Well, as soon as we make camp for the night we'll plan out the whole thing. Uh-uh, no way! Uh-uh. Oh, I thought you wanted to rob banks? Telly, some things should just be make believe. Oh. Are you sure you know where you're going, Telly? You wanna go to Wyoming, don't you? This looks like a good place to spend the night. I think we'll pull off right here. There we are. Looks like we got some slow traffic up ahead. Look, Telly, he's hurt. He's hurt. Hmm? Telly, let me out. Let me out, he's hurt. Come here, boy. Can we keep him, Telly? Can we? Look, he doesn't have a collar. Wait a minute. Let me see here. And he is hungry, too. Can we, please? Now, wait a minute. Can we? Oh. Butch... What's wrong, Telly? You leave this dog be. Just leave this dog be. No. No, Telly. No! He needs me. He's hungry. Did you hear me? Leave that dog be! Let me go! You're just a mean old man! All you care about is old chairs and tables and junk! Butch. Butch! Come back here, boy! Come back! It's not your fault! Come on. It's not your fault. I'm not gonna hurt you. Butch! Butch, you come back here! Butch! Where are you going? You leave that dog be. Here, boy. I love you, Butch. You always do that. You make promises and then you lie! I have other responsibilities. You promised! You promised! I guess this is it, partner. End of the trail. The final sunset. Herbie, I don't ever wanna hear you say you're dying again, you understand? Herbie. Herbie! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Honey, it's okay. Smokey! Smokey! Smokey! Telly! Telly, you let him die! You let him die! Telly! How could you? How... That's Old Grizz, son. Eighteen years old he was. Friend of mine. Yesterday afternoon he came up and put his nose right in the palm of my hand. And I knew. Knew what? He was telling me goodbye. Guess he wanted to take a last stroll through the woods. Wouldn't be right to keep him from his last wish, would it? No. Do you believe dogs go to heaven? I don't know. I think they do. Telly! Telly! Well, I better get going on this. Sorry about it. All right. All right. Come on, Butch. Goodbye, Grizz. Sorry, Telly. Butch. I love you, Telly. Telly, when you looked in Old Grizz's eyes, I mean, well, how could you tell? Well, Butch, I guess when you reach my age you just know when another old dog is near his time. What do you see in my eyes? Your eyes? I see a lot of mischief, is what I see. No, really, Telly, look at me. I see a good life, Butch. Full of adventure. Wow! Look at these mountains, they look like ice cream cones. Yeah. You know what we ought to do? We ought to buy a couple of these mountains. Take 'em back to Cleveland. You're right. Folks back home would appreciate seeing them outside the kitchen windows. We must be getting close to Wyoming, huh, Telly? Yeah. There it is! All right! Yoo-hoo! Did not! Did too. Did not! Did too. Did not! Did too. Old Butch was all the time shooting people. Butch never shot people! Just Indians. All Butch did was shoot Indians. Well, I guess Indians are people too, huh, Tel? I guess they are. Telly! Telly! Indians! Indians! Indians? There are no Indians out there. Yeah, there is, Telly. There's Indians out there. Oh, come on, Butch! There's Indians, Telly, really. You gotta use your imagination, Telly. Telly? Hey, Butch, you in there? Get out of here, you dirty old man! Oh, my golly! I'm not Butch! Well, I... Telly, where have you been? I've been looking all over for you. Hey, I thought you were in there. Come on. Well... Hey, Telly, let's go inside. Why, you can't go in there! Did you read that sign? They'll throw you out of there. Come on. Say, fellas, what's the problem? Well, boy wants to go inside, I'm afraid he's a little too young. Don't you worry about that. My name is Lester. I'm Herbie. I mean Butch. Yeah, and you can call me Telly. Well, you look kind of familiar, Butch. I've been around. Hey, you fellas play cards? Er, cards? Er... Well, yeah. Well, come on in, I'll take care of it. Well, that's mighty nice of you. Come on, fellas, this way. This is gonna cost you five bucks. $5? All right. Well, I'll see ya. I'm out. Too rich for ya, huh? $5. All right! I'll see that. Hey, what do you think you're doing? I have an ace high flush you're gonna have to beat. Ace high flu... I'm out! Beats me. Well, I guess it's mine. What? Butch? Butch, what's the matter? You all right? I'm sick, Telly. Excuse me just a minute, I think the boy needs a little air. Back door there, take him out. Here, right here. Come on. All right. Guess that cigar made him a little sick. Come on, let's go. Well, it's my deal, is it? Mmm-hmm. Butch. Butch, that is the meanest, low down, rottenest idea I've ever run across. I know. What kind of a guy do you think I am? Well... Come on! Well, I'm sorry, gentlemen, but I think I've done you again. Well, beats me! Oh, that beats me, too. You know, fellas, this is sure gonna make things easier for the boy. Oh. He... He's in really bad shape. Yeah, I know. You know what? My God! Oh, my! Butch. Butch! Butch! Butch, Butch! Butch! Butch! Why didn't you tell me? Why didn't you tell me? My best friend in the whole world and you sucked me in on a trick like that. Why didn't you tell me you're dying? I didn't think you'd take me to Wyoming. My God, you're dying. I let you run me all over that countryside chasing some crazy dream of cowboys and Indians. Well, I need that dream, Telly. Well, maybe I need it, too, but not this way! I've been playing nursemaid to a sick little kid. You used me, boy! Did not. Maybe I'm like Old Grizz. Maybe I needed to just take one last walk in the woods before I die. You're going back. But first you're going to go to a hospital. No, I'm not.You're going to a hospital! No, way! Come on, boy! Butch! Butch, you come back here! Butch! Butch, we can talk about this! Come on, now. Butch! Butch, for heaven's sake! Hey, Butch! Come on! Come on. Butch! Butch, come back here! Are you all right, son? No, sir. Are you a preacher? Yes. Can I help you, son? Yes, sir. I have cancer. I'm scared. My friend back there, he's mad at me. Please help me. Would you like to pray about it? Lord, this boy has come freely to ask for a touch of your hand. Calm his spirit. Give him strength to believe that is your will for him to grow in health and in strength. And give him faith to believe for your great plan of salvation. Amen. Feel better, now? Thank you. I'm ready. I'll go now, Telly. Why didn't you tell me? My best friend in the whole world and you sucked me in on a trick like that. Why didn't you tell me you were dying? - It's okay, Herbie. - It's okay. Dr. Jackson, outside call. Dr. Jackson, outside call. Hi, Sundance. How are you, partner? How you feeling? Great. Next stop, Hole in the Wall. Yeah, I was afraid you'd say that. But when the preacher prayed, it made me feel good. It ain't gonna work. You remember Old Grizz, Telly? It ain't gonna work. You looked him straight in the eye, and you knew that was the end of the line, huh, Sundance? Will you cut out that Sundance stuff? This isn't storyland, Butch, this is for real. You're gonna go back to Cleveland and that's that. Besides, we're almost busted. Busted? Busted, broke. Remember that $100 I gave you, Telly? I still got it. Gave me? Well, that you wouldn't take. I still got it. It ain't gonna work. You all right, fella? That ain't gonna work, Butch. Look, Butch, even if we wanted to keep on going we'd probably never get past these bandage pushers. Don't you think they've already seen the paper? Here, look at this. Front page. We gotta make our move while we still can. Oh, no. Butch, I... I... I don't think... I don't think we can, Butch. I still don't think... Well, maybe. Okay, you get your clothes. I still don't think it's going to work. Well, all's fair and square. Right, my vision of loveliness? Well, sweet talked another one. Best deal I ever made. Gun, pony and the trailer. Another sucker. Well, like my pappy used to say, love 'em and leave 'em. Your daddy doesn't know what he's talking about. He does too, he's a lawyer. What's the matter, Butch? He's here. Who's here? It doesn't matter. I'm ready for him. Butch. What did it feel like? What do you mean? That preacher praying for you. Like warm honey. Hard to beat warm honey. Yeah. Come on up there. Oh, let me give you a hand with that, partner. How are you doing today, Telly? Uh, right. Get down. Who are those guys? I don't know. What is it? That's it, Hole in the Wall. Robert, what do you see? I see the car. They're up there, all right. It's Herbie. Thank God. Let's get going. No, wait. I'll go by myself. Well, sir, that's up to you. I can drive you up there. No, it's best if I go up alone. It'll be all right. Do you want me to go with you? No, please. It's my responsibility. Just give me some time. Butch, that's the law. Who's that other guy? We got to get out of here, Sundance, they'll take me back. All right. Let's make a run for it. Come on. Grab that rifle, Butch. Come on, come on. Come on. Come on, come on! Come on, now. That fella is still coming. Come on, boy, come on. Come on, come on. Come on. He's coming. Who is that guy? I don't know. Come on, let's keep going. Hey, wait a minute. What? What's the matter? I know that guy. You do? Well, who is it? It's my dad. Oh, no! We better get out of here. Oh, no! Hey, Herbie! Herbie! Please don't let him take me back, Sundance. Please, not yet. All right, Butch. We better split up. I'll cover for you. Well, old partner, I guess this is it. You know, I'd been a rocking chair dreamer all my life. I would've died one, if you hadn't come along, Butch. Maybe we should've gone to Bolivia. Bolivia? I flunked Spanish. Come on, get on. All right. Okay. Okay! You go do it. Give 'em hell, Butch. Give 'em hell! Go on! Never say die, Butch, never say die! The rocks, boy, you watch the rocks! Herbie! Herbie! Another step and you're history. Stop! I want to give up, Mr. Stampley. Don't make me do this! I just want to see my son. You leave us alone! Please, Telford! Stop! I want to see my son.Hey! I just want to see my son. He doesn't need you now. No. But I need him. Well, I need him, too. You want to take it all from us, don't you? Yeah, first my shop, then... Then our dream. Well, you can't do that. What are you holding? Keep your hands up. What have you got there? Your shop, Telford, it's yours. Yeah. Well, I'll be... Hey, look at that. Well, I'll be... Butch. Butch! What do you know about that? Hole in the Wall. I can hear it. I'm not too old! I'm not too old, I can hear it! I'm coming, Butch, I'm coming! Butch! I'm here, Butch. You're too slow. You're dead. You're a dead man, Butch. You're too slow, Butch. You're dead. You can't take us all. It's over for you, Cassidy. Draw! Draw! Draw! Draw! Draw! Draw! Draw! Draw! Butch! Cassidy! Good job, Butch! Herbie... Hi, Herbie. Butch, it's Butch. Yeah. Butch. How's Mom? She's fine. She's waiting for you down the hill. She missed you. I missed her, too. Herbie... Herbie, I'm... I'm sorry I never took you to the clinic. Guess I wanted you to be strong for both of us, huh? See, when you left home, that scared me. I thought maybe I wouldn't see you anymore. I... I felt like I'd failed you as a father. I was afraid I was going to lose you, son. I'm sorry. Sorry. Dad! Eh, come on along, girl. Come on. Atta girl, atta girl. You did good, girl. You did real good. Sundance! Sundance! Sundance! We got to get out of here, Sundance, they're after us. What is it, Herbie? What's the matter? Come on, Dad, hurry, they're after us. Come on, Dad, they'll get us. What are you talking about? Hurry up, Sundance, hurry. I'm going as fast as I can. Wow, here they come. Herbie, I don't see anything. Look at 'em. Here they come. I am looking at 'em, but I just don't... They're getting closer. Yeah. Yeah, I see 'em, Butch. I see 'em. Let's get out of here, Sundance. Do you really see 'em, Dad? Yeah, there's five of 'em. Gee, Dad, I don't see five. I only see four. No, no, no, the guys in the back are riding double. Riding double? Do you think we're gonna make it, Sundance? Well, barely. Just barely. They're really coming. I think I see Robert. They're not slowing down. They're not gonna stop. Mom! Mom, I love you. That's too fast for this road! Herbie, Robert! Yoo-hoo!
