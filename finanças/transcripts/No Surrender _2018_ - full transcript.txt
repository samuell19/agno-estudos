(GIRL WHIMPERING) Hey, hey. - Slowly. - Let me go! Hey calm down. Look, look, look, it's okay. Don't worry, don't worry. Hey, it's okay. Take it really easy. Come on, it's okay. Let me go! I said let me go! Let me go! Verily, those who fear the Lord, shall have forgiveness and great reward. God speaks the... (GIRL SCREAMING) Hey, Saad, Ibrahim, wake up! I think something's going on, someone's screaming. What is it? - What is it? - Get up! (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (GIRL SCREAMING) You sons of bitches! Go home you silly bastards. Go home, it's better for you. I'll count to one and then he's gonna shoot you. Get back here, Ali! Five, four. Get back here. Three, two. Ali!

NARRATOR: Karmouz. (LIVELY INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) Handsomer and sweeter than sweets. Flattery will get you nowhere sister. Get dressed, your breakfast is getting cold. Such disrespect! Listen, is this how I raised you, girl? Youssef, I'm too old for this. Youssef? It's Big Brother Youssef, still? No! Faten, come here. What is it? Where's your sister? Nawal didn't sleep all night. Fine. I'll talk to Saleh ask him not to visit the house anymore. You're growing up beautifully. You get more suitors every day. Don't worry; I'll see that you marry that officer. He'll teach you to behave. I still can't imagine what he sees in you! I'm not marrying anyone who's gonna teach me to behave. Get up, Nawal. Don't pretend to be asleep. I was asleep. You'd be so gorgeous if you stopped crying. But no, you're a nag like your mother. May she rest in peace. You have a pure heart like her. Well, nobody gets everything they want in life. You have what's most important. People get old and wrinkled and their teeth fall out, but their hearts never change. I won't force you to do anything against your will. God bless you, Youssef. Big Brother Youssef. You girls never listen. Get up. (INSPIRING MUSIC) Hey, Zouba. Stamp this and I'll be a lot happier. When do you think Youssef will arrive? There he is now. - Hey officer. - Send It. Saleh to my office - when he arrives. - Hey officer. Officer! You know I'm not able to work until you clear me, please. I told you I don't stamp red licenses. And why is that? Would you rather me steal or something worse. We make people happy and besides, it's all legal. Legal! Are you bringing the law to me? God forbid. As if the British Consul was a client of mine. Like I said, we just make the students happy. It. Saleh will stamp it for you. No, let constable Aziz stamp it. Constable Aziz is the one who arrested the students. Oh no! Aziz arrested the students? Who will we make happy then? AZIZ: They caught that kid Asfoura sneaking up the pipes of a house. The residents caught him and handed him in to lieutenant Saleh yesterday. Get up, kid, get up! I didn't do anything, officer Youssef. Again, Asfoura? Haven't you learned by now? I promise I wasn't stealing this time. Why were you climbing the pipes then? Were you cleaning them or training for the Olympics? My girl was mad at me and I was bringing her flowers. Flowers! Yeah, haven't you ever been in love before? Aziz. Yes, sir. Did he have flowers on him? No, sir. Book him. Not flowers, but seeds. She was gonna plant them. Haven't you ever planted flowers? Book him for a court hearing. What'll we do about this monster that's fallen on our heads? (OMINOUS MUSIC) Wait for Lieutenant Saleh to transfer him? No Sergeant, I have to do it myself. Nobody knows what could happen with him. When you see an officer walk in you stand up. You're a criminal here. Your mom loves me more. Get the men ready to transport him. Yes, sir. (GIRL CRYING) YOUSSEF: Who's this girl? The constable caught her trying to jump off a bridge. Who are you and why are you here? Stop crying and answer me. If my dad finds out, he'll kill me and then he'll die. It's not my fault. It's not my fault. Bring my coat and cover her. (FOREBODING MUSIC) From the British camp in Alexandria. There are two cavaliers missing. Mark Sam and Steven Samuel. Merciful Lord! May you rest in peace, Ali. It was his time. She seemed like a respectable girl. They took her by force, right? She's Sheikh Abdel Qader's daughter, the mosque sheikh. Their troop would know where they are. The boat that was burned will give us away. Stop whining, Saad. Let's think about what we're gonna do. If we stay, they'll catch us and if we run, they'll find us. If we turn ourselves in to the police, they'll hand us over to the British. Everyone swears by officer Youssef and his chivalry. Dear God! What was his name? Ali. Call his family. I'm so sorry Steven. I won't be able to afford to bury you back home in that heath you loved so much. So we have to bury you here in this rotten, fly-infested hell. Why are we here? Why should we be killed here? My child, my husband, all gone to this senseless war. And those who are left behind are haunted by their screams. We have to end this war before it ends us all and I don't give a damn about the king's orders. Enough! General Adam. Go to Karmouz Precinct and bring back Mark and those two kids. Yes, sir, but the problem isn't me going. It's the officer. I'm done talking. Understood? Yes, sir. Excuse me, sir. What did we do wrong that you've arrested us? We have a right to know. You don't know who I am, but you know my uncle, General Frank Adam. I'm General Youssef El-Masry and you're mine. Hello Johnny. You there. Are you a student. Hey Officer, I've been waiting all day. Stamp this and let me go. Have some patience, Zouba and I'll see to it myself soon enough. Good morning. Morning sir. Riyad El-Shandaweily, MP. Where's the officer in charge of this precinct? ♪ Rule Britannia ♪ Brittania rule the waves ♪ We will never ever ever Steven's dead. Mark's locked up in an Egyptian prison. Your men are dropping like flies. And you don't even lift a finger and I'm the crazy one. Why don't you let me out of here? Let me do what I was born to do. I'll kill every one of them if you give me the chance. Feed him. Feed him well. You tell the Egyptians that I'm coming. And hell's coming with me. You want me to hand over Mark and those two kids to the general? I'm trying to resolve a crisis. Hmm, you don't see honor as I do. There's a girl out there who is trying to stamp her red license, yet I won't do it. It's her legal right but my conscience won't allow me. Honor is what my father taught me. If I give you those kids, I'll be no better than Zouba. I can't have that. Your father would have agreed with me. Don't be stubborn. General Adam can have them, but after the trial. No, he can take them right now, right from here. Then let him come take them. You're a stubborn one. You want me to report to them that officer Youssef El-Masry refused to hand over the officer and the kids. Well, you can run back to your General Adam and inform him that Youssef El-Masry will hand over his nephew. Very sensible. As a corpse. What did he say? He's refusing. You're out of your mind. It's an order from the British government. Go! What? Get out! No! (GRUNTING) Don't move. Okay. Leave here, don't move. All soldiers. Nobody fire. Don't shoot. Hold your fire! Lock him up with Mark for attacking an Egyptian officer. Tell General Adam if he comes here he'll get locked up. You're only making things worse for yourself. Don't say I didn't warn you. (SIRENS BLARING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Gather all the men. We have a mission. TO avenge our brother who was killed and rescue the one who remains. Raise the army, prepare your ammunition. Gather your weapons, get your horses. We will open the doors of hell in their faces and we will show them who is the strongest here. What's going on out there lads? What? Let me out, I can fight! We'll show these filthy Egyptians the power of Great Brittania. (MILITARY MUSIC) Take her to the door of her house and eat something on the way back. Quickly. Take care of yourself. You too. Faten! (FOREBODING MUSIC) The British army is heading towards the precinct. Something really strange is going on. Listen to me. Have the officers take up defensive positions inside. Lord have mercy. Close the door and barricade it with the desks. What's going on? Get up, girl! It looks like there's a raid. What's wrong with you? Come with me, I'll hide us inside. Come. What's going on? I'll tell you later. It looks like war. It is war. Distribute arms and ammunition to the men. Gather round. Nobody fire except on my order. Keep it moving. (CIVILIANS YELLING) Aim your weapons towards the door. (CIVILIANS SCREAMING) Be brave men. None of us will die here today. (SOMBER MUSIC) In the name of General Adam Frank, military consul for Alexandria; And delegate for the British Mandate; Officer Youssef Amin El-Masry is to hand over the two British officers, Mark Sam and Jack William, as well as the two criminals Ibrahim Sweilam and Saad Eddin Mutawei, peacefully, before sundown. This must be done so as to not expose civilians and Egyptian officers, under his protection, to danger. Should he fail to comply, he will be charged with mutiny in a time of war. The punishment for which is execution, for him and all who aid him. General Adam Frank. If anyone approaches the door, shoot them. Saleh follow me. Rest darling, being sick is nothing to be ashamed of. I thought it was an air raid and that we could just hide out here for a while you know. But this is something much bigger! Poor thing. You look like you stepped right out of the village. Never mind, it's not your fault. All of this is because of me. It's all your fault? Well, now you better explain it to me. I'm hungry. Hey, man, find us something to eat. Ezzat El-Wahsh is hungry. He gets hungry because he's human, or do you think he's something else? Answer me dammit. We have orders to shoot anyone who moves. Stay put and stay quiet. Is that so! I'm moving around and nobody shot me yet, or haven't you noticed? Shall I move again? Johnny, what have you done, Johnny? We're keeping each other company, being sweet to each other and smiling coyly. I'm hungry, how about I eat you? Johnny, your mother tasted good. Guard! Ibrahim this was your idea? Why's that officer doing this? We get arrested then handed off to be killed. You're the cause of all this trouble? You're Saad and Ibrahim, right? Yeah, I'm Saad, he's Ibrahim. That's Jack and Mark. What's the story then? What made the whole British army come here? Pamphlets or protests? Are you enemies of the King? No way, I swear. We don't talk politics or even know anything about that matter. Me and this guy - we didn't do anything... - Shh! That's enough. No. They say they're going to demolish the station before sundown. I don't object to dying but I want to know why, okay. This guy says we're gonna die. Shut up, Saad. What is your name? Asfoura; Your brother in death. All this because of a soldier behaving like a rabid dog? If he came to me this wouldn't have happened. Don't look at me like that. We're not the same. If you throw trash into a bin, the bin doesn't get any dirtier. Don't talk like that. The same thing brought us to this station today. You because of your virtue, and me because of my virtue. Except I'm here for a license to sell my virtue. (EMOTIONAL MUSIC) You're disgusted by me, right? Sometimes I'm disgusted with myself as well. But I've learned to hide what's inside me. He won't be happy. And if he can't be kept happy, he won't pay you money. He won't pay you. And if he doesn't pay you I won't have money to eat. I'm not upset, really, I'm fine. Youssef Amin El-Masry, his father was a sergeant at the same precinct. He graduated from police college. His parents are deceased and he has two sisters. No history of disobedience. This guy will never give up so easily. Cut off all sources of water from this station. We might be staying a little longer. (INTENSE MUSIC) The British have completely surrounded the precinct. The people outside are scared. I'm with you to the death. There'll be no deaths, God willing. But they're right. This is no fault of the civilians. This is the officers' job. They leave their homes every day not knowing if they'll return. Even the thieves up there are innocent. Listen, Saleh... Open the basement and let everybody out and you leave with them. Sergeant Aziz will open the door and accompany them on their way out. I'm not leaving. I gave you an order, lieutenant. Will you disobey? Yes. Did you obey every order? I'm sorry. In the name of God. Really now, is this the time? Sergeant Aziz, follow me, quickly. Yes, sir. Get up! Stand. Everybody put your hands above your heads. Anyone who steps out of line will get shot! Follow sergeant Aziz. Step on it! Follow sergeant Aziz! Hurry up. Hey what about me? I can put my hands above my head too, see. Shall I go with them now? Bring Johnny to me. None of you are to blame for what is happening. We're not helping you escape, but none of you are condemned to die here with us today. Consider the fact that you're released. You've been given another chance. Anyone who thinks of stepping out of line, will be shot by lieutenant Saleh, understand? Saleh, take them out as soon as the sun sets. And you, Hind; Go home and tell your dad what happened. I'm sure he'll understand. You know the story. If that girl leaves here she'll be the first to die, and the whole case will be over. And you, lady of the night. I haven't got my red license stamped as yet. What will I do if I leave? Get in the line. Move! But I have no one worrying about me on the outside. The man that I keep happy, won't care if I'm alive or left for dead. But this poor girl needs me. Let me stay and look after her. You'd look after her? What's in it for you? Or do you want to exploit what happened to her? (SAD MUSIC) God forgive you. You have every right to say that about me. But you see officer. I might not make it out. Maybe none of us will make it out alive. So I... I will stay and look after the girl. I won't leave her alone. Go sit with her and look after her. Move! Everyone, turn around and face me. Move slowly, follow sergeant Aziz. You're here because you obey orders, no other reason. But now I'm giving you the choice. Anyone who wants to leave can do so. Don't be afraid. Nobody will be punished because there's no one to punish you. Anybody who wants to leave, speak up now. Salah, you have kids who need you. Go home to them. My kids have God, who is more loving than all. Said, your father's ill. Go and be with him. My father has God, who is more merciful than all. Abdel Tawab. I'm with you, sir. Sherbini. SHERBINI: I'm with you, sir. You must know that death is near. ALL: We're with you, sir. We could all die. ALL: We're with you, sir. We will fear no one. ALL: We're with you, sir. We don't fear those outside. ALL: We're with you, sir. Anyone who sets foot in here will die. ALL: We're with you! We're with you! The war has started. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Let the troops get ready. SERGEANT: All in position. All in position. Get ready to fire. All in position. Ready to fire. All in position. Ready your weapons. Sergeant Aziz. If they ask about our numbers. More than 1000 men and well armed. God be with you, you're a good man. And with you. Prepare to fire. Hold fire. Hold your fire. Hold your fire. Stand down! Arrest that man! Arrest him. Mark and Sam are not with them sir. I'll take the men and search the tunnel. You and you to the tunnel. (SAHEL YELLING) (EXPLOSION BOOMING) Excellent work, men! What're you doing here? Asfoura doesn't run away. SALEH: The basement door won't open again. What's he doing here? I felt sorry for the girl. Besides, you could use all the help. I'm only human. (SOMBER MUSIC) (AZIZ YELLING) Sergeant Aziz is in for one hell of a day. (TELEPHONE RINGING) General Adam Frank, military consul. In the name of the Queen and the British Government I am speaking with you. You're a guest here on Egyptian soil. If you want to talk to me, talk Arabic. General Adam. You say you're the military governor representing the British. I'm an Egyptian officer. I only recognize the interior minister. Your nephew is being treated well, until he goes to court and gets the death sentence for murder and for rape. Don't force me to carry out the sentence without a formal hearing. Listen carefully, I'm general Adam Frank, and I've lived in Egypt since you were a kid. I'm telling you that what you're doing will only lead to your death and the death of your men. If I fear for my nephew, someone who's womenfolk are alone at home, especially if they're women, should fear for them. You have exactly one hour. Let me do this for you sir. I can get out and go to them. I can get out through the back. I was planning on running away tonight anyway. I'm just being honest. They'll do to you what they did to Aziz. I'm not Aziz. My name means birds and birds fly. Either way they'll get there first. They have cars. I told you, I can fly. The streets leading to your house are very narrow, they can't get through; I'll go over the rooftops. Come on, we're wasting time. Don't think too much about it. Or it'll be too late. Let me go with him, sir. When was the last time you climbed up rusty pipes? No reply. I think I'll go alone. All right, Asfoura, go. Asfoura. Tell Nawal she's a nag like her mother. Won't she get mad? No, stupid? It's so she knows I'm the one that sent you. I was gonna give it to my girl but it was too late. Try not to die. I'll do my best. Saleh Don't let him move till he hears music. Right. Step on it. I say, Zouba, I know that you intend to repent, but I have one last request then you can repent at your leisure. What? How can you be in the mood when we're in this mess? This is miserable and depressing. I don't feel like making anyone happy, least of all you. (HORSE NEIGHS) Peter. The officer's address is in this file. Send some men to bring in his sisters without any harm and to be sure, do it yourself. You, you, come with me. (LIVELY MUSIC) Asfoura, make sure you give them this. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) They're underestimating us. Or they're trying to distract us, while he tries something else. Till now I don't know what he's thinking. Anyway, secure the door. You heard the general, hold your position. Prepare your weapons. (TENSE MUSIC) (LIVELY MUSIC) Miss Nawal says, she's a nag like her mother, but kind-hearted like her mother. They're at my relative's house now. Thank God. Your family is safe now. Really! Thank God. I'm so happy I want to dance again. But I can't, my hips nearly broken, very nearly. (THUNDER CLAPPING) (OMINOUS MUSIC) I pity the soldiers who don't have a drop of water. Are you always worrying about everyone? May God give you strength because you obviously need it. You know, Zouba, Had my sisters been hurt, I'd never have forgiven myself. Look, tell me this. A woman like me who used to work as a prostitute but repented, could she... I mean... Could she what? - Could she... - What, Zouba? Would you marry me? (LAUGHS) I wouldn't stamp your license Zouba and you want me to marry you? Really? I know what bothers you about me. It's that my name is Zouba. That's not my real name. What's your name then? My name is Bamba. Does it make a difference? Yes it does. (BOTH LAUGHING) (GUNFIRE EXPLODING) Hold your fire! (WOMEN SCREAMING) (SOLDIERS YELLING) Hold your positions. Secure the door! Turn out all the lights except this one. Cover me. Hold your fire. Hold your fire. (GUN COCKING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (GUNSHOT BANGING) (SOLDIER GROANING) His mom's my girlfriend. Turn on the lights. Everybody take shelter! Get away from the windows! They might fire again. Get down, men! Get down. (GUNSHOT BANGING) (GUNSHOTS BANGING) (SOLEMN MUSIC) YOUSSEF: Saleh. Saleh. Saleh! ZOUBA: Oh my God. Oh my God. Saleh. I'm thirsty. I'm gonna die. YOUSSEF: Bring him some water, quick! I'm gonna die. YOUSSEF: Don't be afraid, you're not gonna die. Don't be afraid. The water. Hold on, Saleh. Don't be afraid. Water, hurry! Here, drink. Drink this. - Drink, Saleh. - Drink. YOUSSEF: Saleh! ZOUBA: No, no! He's dead! - Saleh! - No, no, no, no! - Saleh! - Oh, no! You killed him, you bastards! - Saleh! - No, no, no! The bastards killed him. Get up boy! Wake up! Get up! Enough! If you kill him they'll bring the station down on our heads. Got it. ZOUBA: Please no, please. Get up! Bring me Shandaweily. Sir. And release the crazy one. Yes sir. EZZAT: He's no better than the ones who died, Youssef. You don't know what he meant to me. He wasn't like your brother, he was your brother. But he didn't die because of us. You of all people should know how I feel. All I feel and know right now is one thing. We're at war. Debts aren't settled by the dead but by the living. Hey sir, who's that? Ezzat Abd Rabbu El-Wahsh, a military officer. In the battle of Alamein, his battalion got orders to attack the Germans. He decided that it wasn't our war and gave orders to retreat. He was relieved of duty and sentenced to death by the British governor. He escaped and formed a gang to kill and slaughter English soldiers. You mean the guerrillas? He called them that. Ezzat was an old friend of Youssef's dad. In a way you could say he was raised by him more than his own father. Step on it, man, we're late. Your officer killed a number of British soldiers and is sheltering mutineers and murderers. Listen to me, I'm going to announce that this is a case of civil disobedience by Youssef Amin El-Masry. The British tanks will surround the station along with an Egyptian police force. You want Egyptian policemen to kill other Egyptian policemen? No, I want your Egyptian policemen to kill a bunch of mutineers and criminals. My God! If your men are so strong and you have the station surrounded with those arms and military power, why don't you just attack and be done with it? If two English officers weren't in their custody, I'd do it. Are their lives precious but ours are not? (FOREBODING MUSIC) What I mean to say is... Any action against that officer could turn him into a national hero. The man is well-loved throughout Alexandria. Your job is not to make him well-loved. Understood? Excuse me, sir. Goddamn you! (CHURCH BELLS RINGING) TECHNICIAN: Five, four, three, two, one. Address to Cairo, we've just received an urgent news bulletin. An Egyptian officer, Youssef Amin El-Masry, has mutinied against his superiors, and against the orders of the British governor in Egypt, putting his life and the lives of other civilians in danger, due to his sheltering a group of criminals and outlaws alike and thinking that he is above the law. This traitorous officer, has tricked the policemen with him into carrying out his orders and mutinous desires, to satisfy his thirst for blood. He's ordered them to follow his plan to murder civilians and military personnel alike, using innocent people as human shields. Therefore, the British governor, in the name of the British government, has announced the mutiny of officer Youssef El-Masry in a time of war. According to military rulings, the punishment for mutiny and treason being faced by the officer is death by firing squad, after being stripped of his ranks. The delegate of the British government warns all civilians and military personnel against dealing with the treasonous officer, or they will be considered criminals and face the same punishment. Peace and mercy be upon you. Thank you Cairo. EZZAT: Do you know what that means? YOUSSEF: It means I'm going to die. It means we're all dead men. Are you scared? Do you think I get scared? What about you boy? No. I'm just making sure nothing's changed. (OMINOUS MUSIC) Wear the cuffs and we'll let you out. I'm Abbas Hassabo. I'm running your transport. You haven't said a single word since we set out. Are you alright? They told me it was a small load; I thought it was vegetables or fruit. I get here and you're the goods I'm transporting. I work with the British yeah, but in the end I'm with my countrymen. I'm talking to you, talk to me so we can pass the time. You touch me again, I'll take your fucking face apart. You understand me? Hey, hey, hey, hey. You're quite ferocious! I can see you're strong. Swear, swear Habibi. The entire British army's out there. They're only missing Churchill. You think they're waiting for nightfall to play a game of chicken with us again? They won't fire a bullet. (TELEPHONE RINGING) Hello, Youssef, this is Riyad El-Shandaweily. I spoke to you before. Listen to me carefully now. Adam's deploying an Egyptian police force to attack the station. The head of the force is Hamza El-Hawary from Attareen station. Don't be be shocked by the fact I'm informing you. I'm an Egyptian like you but my hand is forced. God be with you. (FOREBODING MUSIC) Hamza El-Hawary has orders to attack. They want Egyptian soldiers to fire at each other. What do I tell them? Shoot at your brothers? Adam's playing a dangerous game. I don't want my people getting hurt. I'll bet Hamza is at as much of a loss as you are. We need to make Hamza understand. Sir, he's here. Wait for the Egyptian forces. What you're suggesting will not work. Why not? I'm Asfoura. I can fly like a bird. I succeeded last time because I was alone. I can't take you with me. How do you plan on climbing the pipes? We won't go over the rooftop. We'll go at night through the second-floor window. If you're scared, I'll go alone. Asfoura's never scared. We need ropes. That's easy. Ezzat, take off your clothes. You first handsome. Don't worry, I'll let you play at being the bride. When the Egyptian forces arrive, we will surround Karmouz and the station in two circles. The first circle will be the Egyptian forces surrounded by our forces. Where are the Egyptian forces? They're supposed to be here along with our forces within the hour sir. But Hamza, the officer in charge, took his orders already. But he said he wanted to be here at dawn to gather as many men as he could. So, we'll camp here for one more night and then we'll return to our camp. All of us. Stay away from the barbed wire. Listen carefully. I'm going out on an errand that could save all of us. Officer Ezzat El-Wahsh is in charge until I get back. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) If I get back, God willing. Sir, wait, put this on it'll help hide your face. Can this bear our weight? The rope will, but this metal won't. Can you jump? What? Forget it, come on! (GRUNTING) Sir, I gave an order to the officer in charge of the other station. If his troops don't march at dawn, we'll scale the wall ourselves. Sir. ASFOURA: That's Hamza's house. Go on up, I'll stand watch over here. Right. Listen Asfoura. Yes? You know Sayed Darwish, right? Does he live with Hamza? Don't be stupid man, now listen this is what I need you to do. I'm going up, if you notice anything strange in the street, sing Apple of My Eye. Asfoura has a bad voice. But Youssef may get caught. Then Asfoura will sing. Good. Apple of My Eye. I know, I heard you, go already! (BANGING ON DOOR) Yes? All right, all right! (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Everyone of us must've done bad things in their life, for this to happen to us. I personally know what I did. You too, Zouba, right? What's your name? Salah El-Deheiny. What terrible thing did you do, Salah? Before my father died, may he rest in peace, he made me swear to marry my cousin So'da. I swore to it, but I didn't marry her. Was the girl ugly? Oh, God, she was hideous. Uglier than the situation we're in now. And you think your part in this is because of Se'da? So'da. I don't know for sure. I don't think so. You seem like a good guy. Trust in God. ALL: Please, God! Call out to God. ALL: Please, God! Call out to God. ALL: Please, God! Please, God! ALL: Please, God! Please, God! Please, God! Please, God! Please, God! Please, God! Please, God! What's required of me then? First, I need to know; Do you believe me or not? Why are you silent, Hamza? What do you want me to do? Please tell me. Hamza, you've been ordered to take a force and surround my station, then order your men to fire on their brothers. Do you realize what that would mean? It's not that simple, Youssef. I've been making excuses to delay them, that I needed more men, that I needed more time. Time to fix vehicles. But I can't delay anymore. If I don't do it, they will throw me out and bring one of their men, their men who bow to them. Would I disobey orders while in uniform? Then take it off. What made you take yours off? I am thinking straight. And risk the lives of 50 people? How on earth are they to blame? Now tell me that. They chose to stay. You did it to them. In my place you'd have done the same. Daddy. Go inside. Go inside! Hamza. Laila, please go inside till I'm done talking with uncle. Go on, give Daddy a kiss. - No. - Please. Can I kiss you then? Go on. Laila's grown quite a bit already. Last time I saw her she was only days old. She'll grow to be a blessing for you. May God protect her from evil men. Hamza, all I'm asking is for you to delay the entry just slightly, and we agree on how they're positioned. My men and your men must not fire on each other. Are Adam and his men idiots? Youssef. I can't disobey orders. Is that your final word on the matter Hamza? (BANGING ON DOOR) I forgot the song. Goddamn you man! A British army vehicle's coming down the street. How can we escape, Hamza? Hamza. Is this Hamza or someone else? To the roof, to the roof quick! - Let's go! - Quick. My god. (GRUNTING) You go first and I'll follow; I'm faster. Let's go. Stop there! (GUNSHOT BANGING) YOUSSEF: I don't know what happened. When he saw blood, he froze in place. If that kid tells them you were at Hamza's, everything's ruined. Asfoura wouldn't do that, I trust him. We can't rely on Hamza. Do you realize what they'll do to Asfoura? (SOMBER MUSIC) So let's see if you your man turns out to be brave or whether he'll betray you. Bring that man and follow me. Youssef. Youssef! The accused Awad Hassanein, known as Asfoura, is found guilty of murder and treason. The military governor has decided to sentence him to death by hanging. The military governor is willing to drop all charges against him, if Youssef Amin El-Masry turns himself in instead. If Youssef Amin-El-Masry proceeds, may God have mercy. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) SERGEANT: He has 30 minutes to come out. Come out right now or your friend will be hanged. You won't go right? We've lost enough lives. He won't go. No sir. I'm no better than those who died. I said you're not going. Get out of my way. You're not going. Let me go I said! I said no. Let me go, Ezzat! You're not going. Let me go, Ezzat! No. I'm going and you can't stop me. Let me do what I have to do. Open the door. Open the door. (SOMBER MUSIC) Youssef. - Youssef. - Youssef. Youssef! Youssef! No, Youssef! Youssef! Youssef, no! - Youssef! - Youssef! (SISTERS WAILING) You are accused of treason and intentional murder. You are found guilty and you are charged with hanging until death. If my living is painful to you, then my death will be much more painful, Remember the dead feel no pain. No, Youssef! Youssef! CROWD: There's no God but Allah! There's no God but Allah! (CROWD CHANTING) (GUNSHOT BANGING) (HORSES NEIGHING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (GUNFIRE CRACKLING) (CROWD YELLING) Fight for our country! Support your countryman! MAN: Incoming! Release him. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (EMOTIONAL MUSIC) Mommy! (YELLING) Go, run! (TENSE MUSIC) (GIRL CRYING) Don't harm the girl, please. She's just a child, none of this is her fault. Don't come any closer. (GIRL SCREAMING) If you come any further I'll rip you in two. Don't worry sweetheart, I don't kill women. Get out the way! Let's go. (GIRL SCREAMING) (CRAZY ONE YELLING) (CRAZY ONE YELLING) You're pretty fucking sneaky for an Egyptian aren't you. Come on man. Let's fucking go. Come on. Come on, let's go. See man, that's what I thought. You're nothing. Just a fucking dog. Just a little dog. Woof woof. Get up. Now, I'm gonna finish you now. It's time to finish you. Come on. Zouba. Just a fucking dog. (LAUGHING) Zouba! Get on your feet! Goodbye Englishman. Why are you hiding in here? (WOMAN SCREAMING) Move it woman get out. Blow the arm. Don't let those filthy animals flee. Where are we going? A police camp near the salt flats. You'll turn yourself in and be put to death. Hold him tight. What about Hind? Zouba knows what to do. Come on. (WOMEN SCREAMING) Kill him. Come on! We're gonna die. Shoot them! Shoot them! MAN: Evacuate the station. (EXPLOSION BOOMING) (SOMBER MUSIC) Mr. Youssef's not in the station and Miss Faten is safe. (YELLING) The military court condemns the accused Youssef Amin El-Masry to death by firing squad for the crimes of premeditated murder, the crime of mutiny in time of war, and risking the lives of civilians. HOW DO YOU PLEAD: Guilty or not guilty? Guilty, sir. Death penalty is agreed. Court is adjourned. Are you guilty or not Youssef? No, not guilty. You killed only in self-defense. You didn't rebel against military orders, you rebelled against those who have no right to give orders. You didn't risk the lives of civilians, you defended them. And their rights. Here. This is your death certificate. Your sisters are waiting for you outside. Give it to them. They have papers for you with a new name. Kamal El-Refaie. You'll leave Alexandria. Your name has been taken off all records including those of the Interior Ministry. No officer by your name ever existed. But sir? But what? What did you expect after what you did? A promotion or a medal? Or maybe you expected to be a national hero with streets named after you? No, sir. I know that. But sir. One question. What about my body? Is that your problem or mine? Yours, sir. Correct, it's ours and we'll solve it ourselves. We'll hand them Mark's corpse instead. After we burn it, of course. Goodbye, Kamal. (EMOTIONAL MUSIC) (INTENSE DRAMATIC MUSIC)
