Austro-Hungary. Stanislaviv. September 28th, 1868 We can get started, Mr. Doctor. Mr. Doctor. Theresa? Did you see my wife? Theresa! To be honest, I had never seen this terrified face of Doctor Anger. Adele! This is the way I imagine it. It is easier than recalling faces of my own parents who died in this fire together with Doctor's wife. And these two girls saved by neighbors are Adela, Doctor's daughter. And me. My name is Stefania Chornenko, the daughter of poor servants. I am the maid. This is my story. FELIX AUSTRIA First a golden goblet was stolen from the synagogue in Brody. Then the patens in Mykulyntsy, and now the monstrance from St. Anna's church. There are so many thieves and con-men nowadays that it's scary to leave the house. Darling, it's time to take our seats. Good evening. Stefa! -Excuse me. -Thanks. Please. Finally. -Let's exchange seats. -I beg your pardon? I can't see anything! If we exchange seats, won't be able to see anything. You are taller than me. Please, give her your seat. It's not appropriate for me to give her my seat in front of everybody. Just once. Please. Adela, she's a maid. What will people think? Excuse me, ma'am, would you mind taking off this. contraption? Excuse me. I can't see anything because of it, and my master has paid for my ticket and wants his maid to be able to see something, too. Adela Anger's housemaid! They spoil her. Not surprising, considering she married a Ukrainian undertaker. Wearing an embroidered shirt to the theater! Excuse me. My apologies. We didn't mean to disturb you. This world is going to hell. Thank you. Stop! And how am I to walk? Stefa, help me. Stop! Let Stefa enjoy the aftertaste of the amazing performance. The poor actress stands in front of my eyes. I won't be able to sleep tonight. The Maid What does she take to sleep better? By the way. Tomorrow the new priest will join us for dinner. You will do your best, won't you? How can I possibly do it on such short notice? Make an effort. Stefa will make an effort. Of course. Who else would get up early in the morning, buy all the provisions, cook it. Priests like fish. So, tenches. Tenches a la Francaise. What shall we do about the menu? Don't you worry about it. So nice. What would I do without you? If you only knew how much Petro likes sniffing me. Like a hedgehog. It's all because of your herbs. -What smells so sweet? -It is for him. Good night, Daddy. It's burning! Hush. It's just a dream. Now, now. It's over. Everything is on fire. -Is it better? -Yes. I'll give you your medicine. Listen to me, Stefa. Listen carefully, child. You and Adela are like two trees whose trunks have intertwined. Think about her, think about your life. It will be difficult for you, but you must. What? You must serve Adela! Look how early she rises. What a hard-working, obedient child. But she could have made her own soap rather than buy it at a store. How wasteful! This wretched province, this stupid house! I want to go back to Vienna! -I want to go to Vienna, too. -You don't belong there! What makes you think so? How dare you speak to me like this? That is how we speak in our backwater town. If you don't like it I can take you to the attic. Hello, Miss Stefa. This rain! The street lamps are flooded. -It's for the best, Wojcieh. -How do you mean? We'll all soon live in Venice. How much for the tenches, Madam? Tenches are scarce now. Tenches are expensive. What do you mean, scarce? There is so much water around that you can catch them with bare hands. Then please go catch them yourself. How much then? Velvel! Son! Come here! What would you like, ma'am? Miss, will you buy it or are you going? Should I kill it? Do you want me to kill the fish? N-no, thank you. Thank you. I should have killed them for the lady. Did you see her fall? When Austrian soldiers throw their sacks out of the trains, they land with the same thud. Oh, that is just so funny! I think I even burst my air bladder laughing. Now you need to get blanched in boiling water. Half a minute should be enough. The mushrooms. First saute them. Then chop the soft roe and mix with the mushrooms. Add salt, pepper, and parsley. Mix a spoonful of butter with two egg yolks, add the soaked rolls and the soft roe with mushrooms. There. Perfect. Now welcome to the oven. Yes, Stefa. Make them such a dinner that this priest eats his own fork. You are still not ready? I need to get dressed now. And the hairdo! And you did not take out our chamber pot. You are not getting anything done, Stefa! I thought you'd have everything ready by now. Maybe I'll listen to Petro and hire another maid. Oh God. Stefa? Stefa? I wonder, what's he like, that new priest? Petro said his wife had epilepsy. Poor thing. Don't fidget. Moroccan jasmine. Hello! Anybody home? Joseph Stefa dear! You won't believe it! Look who's here! It smells so of jasmine here. Glory to Jesus Christ. Glory forever. Do you recognize him? It is so nice here. So nice! -By the way, I'm Ivanka Ridna. -Nice to meet you. Dear Adela, what a beautiful comb with a cicada. Astonishingly beautiful. And the boots! Joseph! And the shiny stockings! How nice that you and Adela are still inseparable. The doctor would be so happy with your loyalty. I was certain that you had long gotten married and left this house. Our Stefa still hasn't decided to make some decent man happy. We can't fathom what we have done to deserve this treasure in our house. I would never have thought. Your clerical robe suits you. Being married suits you. I am sure you will have beautiful children. Are they going to feed us here or what? And this is your silverware, right? How beautiful! Look, Iosyf! Father, tell us how do you find your new place, your new parish. Where did you serve before? I served in a small Hutsul village, up the mountain, close to the sky. My Ivanka is from there. Would you sit with us? I don't know. I should not. Oh Stefa, don't play the fool. Since when? What a delicious soup. Still, Father. I can't get used to calling you this. You were so in love... with medicine. My father considered you his most talented student. Why this sudden change? It keeps on raining. How to avoid thinking of the Great Flood and Noah's Ark? -Father? -Nothing has changed. Nothing has changed. Miss Stefa! Do I smell fish? I am dying for some fish! My little fishy! And what's interesting, valuables are disappearing not only from churches but also from synagogues. I am telling you, Father, this whole story with temple robberies is somehow connected with the circus. Stefa, what do you think about this? Since when you are interested in maid's opinion? No, thank you. -What do you mean? -I don't eat fish. -Since when? -As if you didn't know. Since childhood. -But I took all the bones out. -No, thank you. The guests like it, and that's all that matters. Stefa. This beanstalk is in love with you. All our organs are dependent on the nervous system. Did you see his giant nose turning red? It's ok. I am very sorry, Miss Stefa. Stefa. Hands off me! That's absurd. Absolutely unacceptable and simply shameful! You think I do not hear what people are saying? My God, if only my father could hear you! Your father. Your father is the one to blame for this. Petro. Stefa. I know you're up. What is it? He wants to hire another maid. One that would do her job silently and would not get into bed with us. What about me? Where do I go? He says he would rent you a room and pay for it. He says landlords from Belvedere St. have free rooms. But you won't leave, right? I cannot be without you. Don't go. I cannot bear it anymore. Please. She doesn't want you to leave. What about you? I do not want it, either. Stay. Look. A new one. -She's just jealous. -Right. -Excuse me! -What? -Good morning! -Good morning. -I need to go to the chapel. -To the prison? You can't. No, to the chapel! The chapel is inside the prison, Miss. You can't go inside the prison. But I am here to see Father Iosyf. He asked me to come. Sir. Hey! I was invited. Can you hear me?! Who could have called such a fine lady to such an unpleasant place? Fr. Iosyf asked me to come to the morning service. Perhaps he wanted to absolve lady of her sins. And what does the lady have in the basket? Could it be a bomb? We must check. For safety's sake. Those are presents. For the Father. Mark! Look at this. So yummy. Are priests allowed this? This is a grave sin. -Give it back! -Hey! Devils. Pigs. Vile dogs! Cheeky maid! Let her go. Stefa, what happened? Why are you here? Father. I need to confess. But I cannot. I do not have the right to administer a sacrament out here. And you are not allowed in the prison. Why couldn't it be done here? There's a sinner, a priest, and God. What else is needed? All my life I took care of her, lived for her sake and his. I gave them all my love. The doctor loved me like his own daughter. Even sent me to school together with her. And she was jealous. Dolls have gathered for a ball, Fine are their dresses and fine are their jewels. The nicest of them is the pink doll. She is the queen of the ball!. It is golden, like your heart. She stole it! My waistcoat is the same color as her apron. I put it in the wrong pocket. That was simply a mistake, Sister. Adela always thought she was the only one Dr. Anger must love. She wanted to have everything without giving anything in return. That's why God has not blessed her with children. Such words is a sin, Stefa. Try to forgive Adela and ask for her forgiveness. Why? I know how hard things are for you, Stefa. Recite the Apostles' Creed 20 times. What a surprise! What are you doing here? What are you doing here? I'm going to my husband's shop. What am I doing in my free time is my business. I want to know where you are loitering. You are under my care, do you understand? Petri. I have just started sweeping the floor, and then he sneezed! A God's miracle. An angel has come to life. Holy Virgin! What is going on here? Miracle! Come here. Don't be afraid. -Oh my God. You are so thin. -Give him to me. That's all right. No one will harm you. You're famished! Petro! We are taking him with us immediately. The Boy Someone must be searching for him. Just take a look at him. They were torturing him! Adela, add some cold water. Do not tell me what to do. Maybe he has parents. We should report this to the police. No need to report to anybody. Whoever needs him will come on their own accord. Well? Come to Mommy. Not an angel but a little piglet. Give him to me. You will boil the boy. Don't you have anything to do, Stefa? Go back to your work. Adela, let Stefa do it. Come here! Come, I'm telling you! Savage! What is wrong? Let him be! He is all yours! Go ahead. But be careful. The kid is crazy. Hush, hush. It's all over. She has left. The mean auntie has left. Come here. So, are you afraid of water? See, there is no water any more. Get in. And how about this? Nothing to be afraid of. Give me your hands. See? Such a smart boy. She is the savage one, right? So, what's with him, doctor? He is not deaf or mute. He's just weakened by hunger. And what's with his bones? That's, actually, what we wanted to know. I have never seen anything like this. You should go to Krakow or perhaps even to Vienna. Cutis hyperelastica? The Ehlers-Danlos syndrome? What? Is he dangerous? I'd say, he is simply different. A very, very peculiar child. You blasted loafer! Look what he has done. -What? -Stefa. This is our house. The church. The synagogue. The cathedral. The city hall. And all the stores. And those are the Hetman's ramparts. The kid has a real talent. Who is this? A beggar. He sits in the square every morning. He has such a good memory. The iron! My ring has disappeared. -Which one? -The one with an emerald. It will turn up. When you remember where you put it. You haven't washed my dress for tomorrow yet! God bless you. I took him in, bringing all this trouble upon myself. I take care of him like of my own child. But all in vain. He is wild like a little beast. He bites and scratches. He does not speak, only squeaks and growls. You are a saint, Mrs. Adela! I'm telling you, you are a saint. She is impossible. Dr. Anger knew. She would perish without me. She's weak and helpless. She can't even boil eggs for herself. That is why doctor ordered me before his death not to leave her alone. This is strange. Are you sure that's what he said? What is so strange about it? Look. When tree trunks intertwine, they hinder each other's growth. You think I should leave? And what do you think, Stefa? Just tell me. I will do anything. I wish I had your strong will and your patience. Perhaps you'd like some profiteroles? I wish I could sit my whole life here with you underneath this tree. Thief! Catch the thief! Catch the thief! Hi there. Whose boy are you? I think I know. Let's go. Greetings, ma'am. Is he yours? God, Here he is! Thank you. You've just saved the city from a scandal. Quite an agile kid. What's his name? Felix. His name is Felix. Felix Austria! Let others wage war; thou, happy Austria, marry. Greetings to the lady and the lord of the house. My God! What an honor, Chevalier! What a surprise. Greetings, Mr. Thorn. I am the man of the house, Petro Skolyk. What an honor! I would love to talk to you about sculpture and art, but a more urgent matter brought me here. Come inside, please. Felix. Chevalier. The salon is not there, it is directly opposite! This is the office of my maid. She is a true magician. Everything here speaks of your culinary magic. Allow me. Would you care for some stuffed cabbage? Wonderful, wonderful. I did not want to trouble you. And that is exactly why sir has appeared out of nowhere. Please! To her it's a joy. She loves your magic. Did it ever occur to you, Miss, that magic is no different from life? People see only what they want to see. People yearn for illusions. I must serve dinner. Divine. Perhaps I should steal Miss Stefa from you. Do us a favor. Stefa, take this away from me. So, your company is already leaving? Alas, that is true. It's a great pity. We were at all your performances until that horrible accident. A colossal loss. A mother dies right in front of her own son. Do you remember our rubber boy? Yes, yes. An amazing boy. So that was her son? Her and my son. What? He is more than a son to me. He is my disciple, my heir. The boy was born a cripple, and I alone believed that he will survive. Love also is a form of magic. This is what holds the world together. Sometimes it is a hard and ungrateful burden. And in order to survive, not to suffocate under its weight, you mop the floors, wash the windows, polish the silver. Isn't that so, Miss? Sometimes it is as light as a bird, and then you bake, boil, cook in order to release the sweet madness that is inside you. Am I saying it right, Miss? Dessert? Felix! Everyone finds the kind of love one seeks. For someone it is a temple, for others, a prison. Someone was born a lady; someone else, a maid. One loves through food; another - through stone; and someone - through prayer. But there are people who are unable to love. It is hopeless to love the boy you are keeping here. He is not yours and will never love you in return. I am offering you one thousand guilders for the boy. We agree. He is not your son, isn't he? He can get into the narrowest cracks. He can take various small precious things from churches and homes. This is the reason you need him, right? -We agree to your offer, Chevalier. -Adela! You! Who do you think you are? Let go of me, you idiot! Isn't my ruined life enough? What has this child done to you? Do I not have the right to love someone? How dare you? Excuse me. It is time for you to leave. I only wanted to wish the ladies to take good care of their nerves. The fire of passion is very dangerous. This is for you, Miss. And this belongs to me. Please. Please get rid of this garbage. Just a moment. I will first rub your temples with the ointment. Stefa, hurry up. This witch Zuza is here. That is because you are a good maid. We have no interest in selling you. Take me with you, lads Take me with you, lads Carry me to the Black Mountains Mother of God. Rejoice, Virgin Mary. The God is with you. Adela Stop! Stop! -Thank you. - Please, miss. What is it? Good God. Let's go. Mrs.Adela, Stefa. -Hello. -Hello. Here. Wow. Please, please come in. Iosyf is not here. He was called to take the last confession of some poor guy. Come in. Apologies. The place is a bit of a mess. I have no talent for keeping house. You do not have to. You should hire a maid. Yes. I will make coffee for you. Although Iosyf does it better than me. He cooks, too, and cleans the house, but not often. You are very fortunate with your husband. He takes pity on me with this illness of mine. Have a seat, Mrs. Adela. I'll do it. I'll make coffee, too. Thank you. Mrs. Adela! I am very sorry. Should we perhaps have a seat at the deck? -We should probably be going. -What? Don't go! I beg you. Don't go. I am so lonely. You are the only people I know here. Iosyf is always in church: takes confession, anoints the sick; he does not have time for me. And... I want so badly to talk to another human soul... about intelligent things; about music, perfume, stockings. Mrs. Adela. It's that very comb! What a miracle! This is for you. For me? The hat? Stefa! Your big-nosed guy is coming! He must have decided to propose! -Glory be to Jesus Christ, Stefa. -Eternal glory, Father. -Your masters are also here? -Only the mistress. So Mrs. Adela did not dart out of my home as soon as she came in? What are you saying? Someone must help you about the house. No one must. I thought a lot about you. I thought and prayed. And here's the man of the house. -Mrs. Adela. -Hello. Our agreement is still on, Father? Iosyf! Here. Take it. Put it in your bag. I don't understand this. What is that agreement between you and Fr. Iosyf? Oh, nothing special. We agreed that he would pray for me. Excuse me. Greetings. What can we do for you, sir? A smart boy. Have you heard? Chevalier Thorn has been arrested. He is a suspect in all those robberies in churches. And now they are looking for his accomplice. They say he's only a child, lean and quick. He can fit into any crack. Soon a special commission will arrive from Vienna to investigate. Thank you. I did not tell you anything. We will not give the child away, right? It is not up to you to decide. You wish to get rid of him because he loves me. Quiet, both of you. I am going to take care of a few things. I will be back for dinner. Right! Dinner! Oh, what a pity. Why did you bring such bad fabric to old Baumel? Why did you pay such big money for such poor fabric? Please, I'm begging you, Mr. Baumel. Next time I will buy only from you. But now we need it really urgently. Oy vey. Urgently. Everyone needs things urgently. As if that nephew of yours walked around barefoot and naked until today. Maybe old Baumel does not like to do things in haste like some schlimazels. Maybe he likes to do things well. Go, child, wait somewhere. This is a special cake. Mom has outdone herself. Mule taam! What's the occasion, Mrs. Baumel? A welcome guest is about to drop by. -Abigail's fiancÃ©. -He is not my fiancÃ©. His mother chose for him the mustached Sidi. She's just trying to scare him so he doesn't get out of control. And he already did. He wants to sail across the ocean. In the New World, apparently, life is new too. I'd like to see how you'd behave if someone scared you with a mustached woman. And he is so handsome. Every Jewish girl dreams of marrying him. And who is that lady-killer? It is only a fishmonger bringing us some fresh carp. Wait. You are talking about Velvel? Greetings, Miss Stefa. How do you know my name? Who doesn't know you? In all kitchens of Stanyslaviv people talk about you. And what do they say about me? They say you prepared the festive meal for Archduke Otto when he returned from the hunt. The Archduke did not even come out of the train during his stop in Stanyslaviv. Because he got carried away with your lunch. The rabbit roulade, the pudding, the pates, the roasted trout. And what else do they say about me? They say strange things. That you devoted your entire life to another woman. That you live with her like a dog with its owner and do everything for her, even though that woman is neither weak nor sick. What on earth are you saying? I am only a maid! Every person lives the best they can! Maids must be paid for the work they do. And they say you don't. Maybe I'm not an ordinary maid. You could work somewhere else if you only wished. -And still, I don't understand this. -What don't you understand? If I were you, I would have definitely run away. For example, with the circus of that Chevalier Thorn and taken the boy with me. I'd break free from this suffocating world. Ivanka! What's wrong? Ivanka? Ivanka? Iosyf! Hold her legs! -You shouldn't come here anymore. -What are you saying, Father? This is wrong. I know you work very hard at your masters' place. But this makes me happy. A person should receive a reward for work. And I have no means to pay you. What is it? What? Stefa? This is the only thing I know. Only to serve. Only in this way I can be useful. Love is taking care of others and forgetting about yourself. Iosyf. Thank you. Thank you for teaching me God's love. Excuse me. We have received reports that the rubber boy from the Coliseum Circus is staying at this residence. Who? Don't play the fool, sir. Surrender the juvenile delinquent to us immediately. Excuse me, Sir, we don't have anyone like that. We only have an orphan named Felix whom we took in out of charity. Then could you please present him to us? And what has that boy done? The little crook conspired with the swindler illusionist Ernest Thorn in robbing temples across the area by getting in through chimneys. How horrible. Felix! Come out please. What does this mean? But, Sir, the reports were precise. Excuse us. There has been an unfortunate mistake. My regards. Follow me, idiots. And now, dear conspirators, start the reverse process. Such fatsos are not permitted in my house! So. Salad of fresh greens a la Francaise, fresh apple and herring salad, milk and vanilla chaudeau, chocolate mousse, Sacher torte, torta Milanese with apples, lemon ice cream, orgeat. Happy birthday, Adela! This will be the best dinner. Felix. -Iosyf? -Stefa. -I need to talk... -Iosyf, not now. Is Mrs. Adela home? -I need to speak to her. -To Adela? Felix! I'm coming. -Hello, Miss. -Hi. Watch out! What is it with you, miss? What do you want? I was actually going to see you. I have long thought about you. I have a proposal. We can help each other. You help me? Yes. And you, me. I have saved up some money. I know how to be a good salesman. And I know what people like. And you know how to cook better than anyone else. We'll open a restaurant. A small one. There, in the New World, and we'll name it after you. What are you talking about? I have bought two tickets for the ocean ship. It leaves from Hamburg. We have separate bunks. Yours is in the ladies' section. Don't worry. Are you insane? Believe me, the Old World does not give a chance to people like you and me. It is dark and cramped here, in this city, in this clumsy old empire. But we will start a new life across the ocean. Don't rush; think about it. We still have time before departure, Ms. Chornenko. And now you listen to me. I no longer want to either see or hear you ever again. Stefa Please. Hello, dear madam. Thank you. Wow! Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to make an announcement! As you know, a boy has been living in our family for some time already. We have found him accidentally - and, maybe, this was God's providence. The boy was an orphan... until today. We are happy to tell you that all the formalities have been completed; from now on, Felix is our adopted son! -Bravo! -Bravo! Felix dear, come here please. For you... Mother. It's beautiful! Thank you. The artist flattered me. I drink to the most wonderful wife in the world. Please help yourself, dear friends. To you, mis Adele. I have not had such a torta Milanese even in Milan! And you still haven't tasted the crawfish pate! -I strongly recommend it. -She is so noble! Taking in this orphan. Just like her father. He also took in that orphan girl, and look what a fantastic maid she has become. Vivat Adela Skolyk! Vivat, my angel. God, give me strength. Give me strength. I am immensely grateful to you, Stefa. None of this could have happened without you. Please forgive me my old teasing. Just know: you are a part of our family. Have you gone crazy, sweetheart? Cleaning the dishes? Come! The guests are waiting. I am so happy. Excuse me. Ladies and gentlemen. I must report a very important piece of news. My mistress, Adela Skolyk, nee Anger, has had a long-term affair with the priest of the prison chapel, Fr. Iosyf. God! -Holy Virgin! -What? Stefa, alcohol has gone to your head. Go take some rest. Forgive me, but I have to do this. I saw everything with my own eyes. And I have proof. No. It's not true. Ivanka? Ivanka? Christ! -Why? -Ivanka! Ivanka! Call the doctor! Ivanka? It's golden, just like your heart. "That dimwitted Ukrainian. That monster. I am so tired of her escapades. I should have listened to father and sent her far away." "Dear Mrs. Zuza, Forgive me for the offence that I inadvertently caused to you during our last meeting. I think more and more often about your offer, and I have decided to accept it and send Stefa to you. You know how she got into my home through a deplorable weakness of mine. You were right, I many times regretted that impulsive decision. I made a mistake, and I harmed Adela first and foremost. But at the same time, I also harmed Stefa. I would like to fix my error before I die." "So, I am sending Stefa to you in the hope you would help her twisted nature find its own support in itself." Did you think of me even for a second? What? Are you silent, too? Stop right now! -Come here. -Don't touch me. Don't touch me! This is my home, not yours. It was never yours. See? I am not as weak as you thought. Ivanka. Did she die? You are forgetting that I am a doctor's daughter. She will live. And you... I really want to kill you now! For what? For the truth? What truth? Have you gone mad? I saw you. I saw you in the salon. I saw him embracing you. My God, how shameless you are. Idiot! This was a hug of joy. A miracle has happened. I pleaded him to pray for me and myself prayed as he had taught me and the Lord has heard us. I am pregnant, Stefa. And what about the stockings? Why did he have your stockings? That was my present to Ivanka. Iosyf saw it and returned. So sorry that Miss Stefa is not here. I came to say goodbye... to both of you. Goodbye? How come? I am leaving today. Are you? Then let me say good-bye to you on behalf of both of us. I am so tired of you, Stefa. I don't know who you are: my sister, my friend? My maid? Or my warden? I am your maid, Adela. If you are a maid, then why do I always control my speech in your presence? Why are your thoughts, your feelings so important for me? And if you are my sister, then why don't we do everything together? Why do you mock me when I try to be of at least some help? Why do you always emphasize that I am a lady and you are nobody? I don't know. I don't know anything anymore, Adela. Don't touch me. Why didn't you send your father's letter to Mrs. Zuza? I didn't send it because I was foolish. I couldn't... didn't want to... didn't know how to live without you. I will have a baby! Can you believe this? Oh God! The house is on fire! Cover your nose and mouth and don't be afraid of anything! Fire can't harm us, remember? Adela. What is it? Don't leave me! Come back! Felix! We are here! Fire! Fire! Fire! It's all right. Everything will be fine. Listen to me, Stefa. Listen carefully, child. You and Adela are like two trees whose trunks have intertwined. Think about her, think about your life. It will be difficult for you, Stefa dear, but listen to me. You must... What? You must leave Adela! Must leave her! Oh God. Forgive me! Please forgive me! Forgive me. My name is Stefania Chornenko. A commoner. A maid since childhood. But from this moment on, I am a free person. Adele! Adele! PETRO AND FELIX SKOLYK'S SHOP
