(phone beeping) (uneasy music) (heavy breathing) (moaning) - I gotta get back to work. Someone's gonna miss us. - Nobody's gonna miss us. (whimpering) (startling music) (gasping) (mirror shattering) (uneasy music) (birds chirping) - I'll be damned, that's J.D. I'll hold the fort down if you wanna go see him. - I don't ever wanna see that bastard again. - Don't get mad at me. I just thought you might want to seem him. - Tom, I don't wanna talk about it. (casual country music) - You need a menu, handsome? God bless me, it's J.D. Edinger! - Hello, May. - Oh my god, I haven't seen you in years! - It's been a long time. - Well, I hope you're gonna stay put a while. - We'll see. - I'm real sorry about your dad. It was a real nice funeral. A lot of people came. - Yeah, everybody but me. - Well I'm sure you tried. - Yes ma'am. - Damn good to see you, champ! - Hey, Tom! How the hell are you? - [May] Does Carrie know he's here? - She's still here? - Sure is! She works across the street with Tom. She's our deputy sheriff. - Has she married yet? - Not even dating regular. - No kidding? - But if I was you I wouldn't go over there right now. She's mad enough to bite a tent pinning nail in two. - Now you two stay put while I get some food in you. - J.D., you know her. If Carrie's anything, she's proud, and that was a pretty rotten stunt you pulled. - Yes, sir. I'd like to talk to her though. - Well, why don't you come back about five and catch her when she gets off. - Thanks, partner. (patting) - [Tom] Sarah took good care of your dad while he was sick. He didn't know how to get a hold of you, so he left her everything. - [D.J.] That sounds fine. All I really want is my truck. - Catch you later. - Bye, see you around. - Take care. (engine starting) - Wow! Fired right up! - Well, he used to come out and start it up about once a month. He said he was trying to keep it right for you. - Yeah? - J.D., this is for you. - What's this? - It's money that your father got when he sold your horse, and he wanted you to have it. - Thank you. Thank you. - Good luck, J.D. - Thanks. (uneasy music) (digging) - Pritchard. Pritchard! - [Tom] Is that you, Carrie? - Tom! This is the Hemmin's police radio. The Hemmins police force just consists of you and me. Who else would be calling you? - [Tom] Oh, sounds like someone woke up on the wrong side of her lonely bed. - Oh, it's just the people I work with that make this job so special. Anyhow, I just came back from breaking up that domestic squabble over at the Henderson place. You think you can maybe go by later and make sure everyone's still breathing? - [Tom] Well, I'll see if I can, Carrie, but you know I got that appointment with the foot doctor today. - Oh, it's the foot doctor today. Tom, you think you can maybe fit a little police work into your busy schedule? - Well, I'll sure try, Carrie. - Tom, I've got a late model Buick wagon, no operator visible. I'm stopping to investigate. Stand by for the license number. (uneasy music) It's got Louisiana tags. Eight, Sam, two, Nora, five, three, six. Standby. - Excuse me? - You startled me. - I'm sorry. - [Carrie] Is everything all right? - Yes, I was just driving, and I wasn't feeling well, and I had to stop. - Are you sure you're all right? - Thank you, officer. - Well drive safe. (engine starting) - It's a long story. It's about a quart of bourbon long. (chuckling) Hey, um, I need a job in the worst way. You know of anything? Could you check on that for me? I sure would appreciate it. Yeah, no, just leave word with me here at the Busy Bee, with May. Hey, Jim, listen, I gotta go. Carrie? Carrie? Hey Carrie, hold on a minute. Can I ... (slap) Carrie, I gotta talk to you. - There was a time I wanted to talk to you too, about four years ago. Don't you think it's a little late now? - Don't say that, don't ever say that! It's never too late. - I don't think we need to put on a show for the whole town. You haven't forgot where I live, have you? - Are you kidding? - Meet me there. - I'll do that. - What are you looking at? - You. You haven't changed a bit. - Don't start, J.D.! You stood me up! In front of the whole town! At the church! Do you have any idea how humiliating that is? - I was all dressed, I was ready to go. All of a sudden I saw my future. I was this old man like my dad, running a store, never having gone anywhere, never having done anything. - Why didn't you ever tell me about this? - I was scared. - Of what?! - Of you, of this! - About responsibility! - Yes, of responsibility. I was young. I was a boy. - And now you're a man. - Yes. That's why I'm back. - I don't know what to do with you. - I heard you came over to my place with a pistol when I didn't show up. - It was gonna be my daddy. Figured the courts would go easier on me. - You thought it out like that? I didn't think he could be that rational in emotional moments. - That's when I figured I'd make a good cop. - I bet you are a good cop. (emotional music) - Hell yes I am. Don't ever hurt me like that again, J.D. (phone ringing) - No, don't go. - I got to. I'm a cop, remember? Harrison here. Yeah, just a minute. It's for you. - For me? Hello? Yeah, no, yeah I can talk now. Bakersfield. No, no, tell him I'll be there Monday. Hey, thanks, thanks buddy. I appreciate it. See ya. - Who was that? - Jim Fentress. - Why was he calling you here? - Well, I left word for him to call me the Busy Bee. May probably thought I'd be here. - You going somewhere? - Yeah. Bakersfield. - California? - Yeah, listen, it's ... He lined me up a job. It's just until I get back up on my feet, I mean. - Can't you find something here? - Like what? - J.D., you leave me now and that is it! No, I can't. Just don't try to say anything. That is it! - You can understand my situation. - No! Once is enough! Get out of my life, J.D.! Do you think you can just come back here and waltz back into my life after all this time? - Hey, hold on a second! I got some say in this! I love you, Carrie. I'm gonna be back next weekend. - Get out. Get out, or I'll do what I shoulda done four years ago. (door slamming) - [J.D.] Carrie, I'm sorry, please. (dog barking) (coyote sniffing) (uneasy music) - Hold on, Frank. Okay. You remember that car I stopped to check out yesterday? - When you come in from the Harrison place. - Yeah. That looks like the woman I saw drive away from here. - What the hell's that mean? - You got me. (radio turns on) - Want a ride? Come on, get in. You're soaked. Come on, I'm not gonna hurt you. Are you all right? You didn't get hurt, did you? - No, I'm not hurt. - [J.D.] Just wet, huh? - Uh-huh. - We'll see if we get some heat to dry you out. What happened? - There was a deer. It jumped in front of me. - Well we'll see if we can get a wrecker, and maybe they can pull you out of that ditch. What's your name? - Patricia. Patricia Harper. - I'm J.D. J.D. Edinger. - Nice to meet you. - It's nice to meet you, Patricia. Hi. - Hi, how you doing? - Lady's car is stuck in a ditch. You know where I can get a wrecker this time of night? - There's a station up the road that's got one, but it's closed till morning. - Just my luck. Thanks. - Yeah. - Come on, let's get something to it, figure what we're gonna do. - All right. - Smoke? - Oh, no thanks, I don't smoke. - Don't you have any bad habits? - No. Not too many. - That's better. - Hi. - Hi. - What can I get you folks? - I'd like a cup of tea please. - You mean hot? - I think you'd better get something to eat. - Oh, then a BLT on toast. - I'll have a cheeseburger, medium, bottle of Bud. - Okay. - You married? Kids? - Two. I must be a mess. I'll be right back in just a moment. - It'll be another minute for your wife's tea. - She's not my wife. - Okay. How about you girlfriend? - [D.J.] No. She's not my girlfriend either. - Well I'm glad, because I think you can do a lot better. - Really? - Lisa. Where's my beer? - It's coming. - How long do I have to wait? - Keep it in your pants, Roger. - Are you forgetting who you're talking to? - Turn me loose! - Hey, hey, come on. You heard the lady. - You, you mind your business, buddy. - She's serving me. I guess that makes it my business, doesn't it? - Excuse me. Thank you. - I'll get your beer, Roger. Gotta go calm the beast. - Wow, look at you. You look a whole lot better. - Thank you, I feel better. What was that all about? - I don't know. Jealous boyfriend, I guess. So listen, where are you headed? - I don't know. - That makes two of us. - Actually, I'm running away. - [J.D.] From what? - My husband. - Well you'll be safe with me. (chuckles) - This woman is supposed to be a nun, Carrie? - You mean with the makeup and all? - That and the fact that she's born two or more children and has had breast augmentation procedures within the last year. - I guess she's not a nun. - Let's hope not. Don't you reckon you'll need some help on this one? - Yep. The Texas Rangers are sending us Jim Babcock. - Why would anyone want to go to the trouble of putting a body into a nun's habit? - I don't know. - It seems crazy, doesn't it? - That's just what I was thinking. Come on, Carrie. Buy you a cup of coffee. - Hey, asshole! - You talking to me? - Yeah, you're goddamn right! (dramatic music) - Go get him, Eddie! - Yeah, I'm fine. (groaning) - Yeah! - Geez. - J.D., get up! Get up, come on! Come on! Oh god, come on. - Okay, just grab my hat. - Come on. Oh God, hurry up. (engine whirring) - What the hell? - It's okay. I got a room. You need stitches. - Really? Listen. I wasn't expecting this. - Neither was I. - What are you doing? - I'm new at this. I'm kinda shy. - But you're married. (delicate music) - I don't know what I want for supper, honey. I'm sure it'll be good whatever you get. Except, would you skip the lima beans tonight? Yeah, thanks. Okay, I gotta go now. Goodbye. Are those the prints? - Yep. Has Babcock showed yet? - Yeah, him and some FBI fellow named Resnick. - What's FBI doing in this? - [Tom] They didn't say. They went to Busy Bee having lunch, and they want you to bring the prints over. - Where's my file? - Oh, they took it. - You don't say. - Now wait. Carrie, don't you go out there with the wrong attitude. - Don't worry, Tom, I'll have the right attitude. - [Man] Now let me get this here, Jim. - No, no, you're in Texas. You're my guest. I'll get it. Carrie! How are you? Carrie, I'd like you to meet Peter Resnick. He's from the bureau. - How do you do? - This is her case. - Jim, where's my file? - Well, Carrie, we stopped by your office. You weren't there and we had to get out to the crime site so I thought-- - Excuse me, Jim. Could we have about five minutes? I'd like to discuss this case with you. - Why, sure you can. May, can we have some coffee over here? Sit down. - I'd like to know why the FBI is interested in this case. - Know anything about serial killers, Miss Harrison? - I'm no expert, but I have reviewed some of the better-known cases. Anything strike you about that, like kind of a pattern there? - There's usually a high sexual correlation to the selection of victims, and the perpetrators are invariably white males. - You ever heard of a female serial killer? - I don't think so. - [Peter] Yeah well neither did we until this nun showed up. - What is that supposed to mean? - Six days ago in Raleigh, North Carolina, a woman named Elizabeth Burrows escaped from the mental institution. Now, before she left, she killed a nurse by strangulation. She took the nurse's uniform. She put it on and she used it to facilitate the escape. Now, two days later a nun was reported missing from Atlanta, Georgia. She turned up in Mobile, Alabama with her skull caved in. Now, the reason I was called in is that the nun that was found in Mobile, Alabama was dressed in the nurse's clothes from Raleigh, North Carolina. - So, does the habit on the body that we found belong to the nun from Atlanta? - Exactly. Laundry markings match up perfectly. - So who's this last body, our Jane Doe? - We won't know till we get the prints to the lab, but I believe that Miss Burrows had met our unfortunate victim somewhere along the way, and she is now utilizing her identity. - That's really weird. Sort of like a snake shedding its skin or a chameleon changing color. Why is she doing this? - I don't know. She probably doesn't know herself. We do know she killed her mother when she was 10 years old. She'd been in a mental institution ever since. - Excuse me. Carrie, they found that Chrysler wagon. It's in Weglin Corners. (uneasy music) - Patricia? Patricia? Hey, what did you do to your hair? - I dyed it. Do you mind if I wear some of your clothes? - Hell no. They look better on you than they look on me. - Do you mind if I take off some of your clothes? - No. (background TV chatter) I thought you didn't smoke. - I'm doing a lot of things different. - Hey, we gotta see about you car. - No, no, forget it. - Forget it? - I'm through with that car. It reminds me of him. - You can't just leave it there. Police will find it, they'll report you missing. - So what? I'm not going back. - What about your kids? - I don't have any kids. They're his. They're not mine. They won't miss me. They don't even know me. - Hey, what's your number? - What do you? No. What are you doing? - I'm gonna dial it. - I can't do this. - Patricia. I'm telling you, you gotta stand up to him. It'll make you strong. It's the right thing to do. - All right! Okay. Can I talk to him alone? - Sure. (uneasy music) - Hi, Vernon? It's me. You calm down or I'll hang up! None of your business where I've been! Yeah. Darling, all I can say, you should have been listening to me. No, you've had all the chances you're gonna get! It's over! - This is it. What are you doing? - You know, she was a terribly abused child. I don't even want to tell you what her mother did to her. She escaped into her mind for as long as she could. When it no longer worked, she killed her tormentor. Her mother. But the guilt was too much for her to take. It drove her mad. And now she's killing innocent people, and we have to stop her. Let's go talk to our witness. - You feel better now? - Oh yeah, I do. - So is this your girlfriend? - Yeah, used to be. Where is she now? - Same place always been. Hemmins. - Is she married with a bunch of kids? - Hell no. She's a cop. - She's pretty. - Yeah. Bright too. I can tell. - Yeah, she is. - I'm smart too. - Yeah. Yeah, I know. (casual lounge music) - What can I do for you folks? - Are you Cecil Yancy? - That's right. - We understand you reported an abandoned station wagon. - Sure did. It was stuck in a ditch about three miles down the road. Funny thing is, they come in here and talk to me when they was looking for a tow. - They? - Yeah, it was a young woman and some man. He said the lady's car was stuck in a ditch, and did anybody have a wrecker. But everything was closed down by then. Then this morning I saw the car, so I stopped, checked it out. Damn keys were in it. So me and my buddy, we got it out of the ditch and we brought it over here. Then I called the sheriff. - What did they look like? - I didn't pay them much mind, you know. They took a booth. Hey, Louise. These people want to know about that couple that was in here last night. You know, that guy that Roger tried to cold cock. - Oh yeah. - Well actually we're primarily concerned about the woman, miss. Did you talk to them? - Sure I did. They had a bit to eat, and she ordered a hot tea, so I remember 'cause that's a first in this place. - Do you think you could describe them? - Yeah, she was kinda of plain. You know, sort of shy and mousy. You know the type. To tell you the truth, I was more interested in the guy she was with. Now he was something. - Was he local? - Heck no. I would've noticed him before. - Did you happen to catch their names? - No, not for her. But I chatted him up while she was in the lady's, and I think he said his name was J.D., something like that. - Um, did you happen to notice what he was driving? - Yeah, a red pickup, an old one from the '50s. It's kinda big and round in the front, with a big grill. You know, like bosoms and teeth. - Thanks. Hey. Hey, Harrison, what are you doing? Hey! Hey! Want to tell me about this? - He's J.D. Edinger. I almost married him right out of high school. He was a football hero and I was the head cheerleader. We were a dream couple, or so everyone thought. Everyone but J.D. He stood me up at the altar. - Are you sure it's the same guy? - He showed up yesterday. I saw him. He was gonna take a job with an oil company and drive off to Bakersfield. - We gotta get back, I gotta catch a plane. - I'm going with you. - Don't you think that's a little bit out of your jurisdiction? - Nobody knows J.D. like I do. I can help find him and find her. - You're still in love with this guy, aren't you? - That's none of your business. - Well, I think it is, especially if it interferes with this case. - I can be professional on this, Resnick. Don't worry about that. Let's go. - All right. (tittering) - Hey, what the hell are you doing? - Don't worry, there's no money in there. - What about your credit cards, your ID, huh? - Don't worry about it. - Suit yourself. - Damn, when did you start drinking beer? - Where'd you put the opener? - It's in there. - I like this gun. - Hey, be careful with that, damn! - Unloaded? - Damn right it is! - Is it dangerous? - I guess it depends who's holding it. What you do is you unhook this loading gate, flip the hammer back once, then you rotate the cylinders, make sure the chambers are empty. That belonged to my great grandad. He was an outlaw till he got too old to steal. (bottle opening) Why, look at you. What happened to that afraid of her husband, mousey little housewife I met the other night, huh? - She's dead. - I guess she is. - Hi. Hey, I'll get the gas. - All right. (dramatic music) - Need some oil too? - No, no, no. Just a pack of Camels. - Okay. Camel Light okay? - Yeah. Come on, give me all your money. All of it. - Are you serious, lady? (gun cocking) - You want to die finding out? Drop your pants. Come on. All right. Turn around, face down on the ground. Don't look at me. - Did you have enough? - Taken care of. - Good. - Tom? I need some time off. I think J.D. might be in danger. - Carrie, I've got some bad news. I just got off the phone to a sheriff in the New Mexico. J.D.'s been tied to an armed robbery of the service station there today. - J.D. stuck up the filling station? - Well, his ... female companion was the ... gunman. But the description matches J.D. And they used his truck. - I can't believe that's true. - Yeah, I know what you mean. - I need two or three days. Can you cover for me? - No problem. And Carrie, I hope this ain't as bad as it looks. - So do I. (casual music) (humming) (gasp) - [J.D] Oh, sorry. - [Patricia] Who taught you how to dance? (water sloshing) Ow, god. Maybe we should quit while we're ahead. - Mm-mm, I haven't danced in years. - Your dangerous. - Yeah? You know what I want? - I know everything about you, J.D. - Yeah? Maybe you do. (kissing) You want to be just like me when you grow up, don't you? - You betcha, cowboy. Just like you. (dramatic music) - Jury deliberations wrap up this week. Both council members are expected to resign if indictments are handed down. The body of a Baton Rouge, Louisiana woman missing since Wednesday was found yesterday near Hemmins, Texas, the apparent victim of a serial killer. The body, identified as housewife Patricia Harper, was discovered in a shallow grave in a desert near the small Texas town. Investigators believe Miss Harper is the third victim of a serial killer who said to be traveling west at this time. Authorities are looking for anyone who might have come in contact with the woman since Wednesday. Now we have Larry with the weather. (groan) - [Tom] We've got major storm warnings locally, so be very careful tonight because conditions are changing rapidly. Taking a look at the map, you can see the storm front moving right in off the coast, with another one right behind it. - It's kind of scary. (giggling) Ah, here it is. - Yeah, great. - Oh, wow. - Well. - It's still early. You want to go out and get a drink or something? - Oh, no thank you. I've had a long day. - Oh, come on, Carrie. Let's go hang out. I want to spend some time with you. - You spent the whole day with me. - Yeah, but that was work. - I'm tired. Ask me again, okay? - Okay. You want to go have a drink? - (laughing) Peter! Good night. (anxious music) (dog snarling) (gun shots) - Morning. - Morning Mr. Campbell. - Morning, Tim. - Freeze! (gasp) This is the holdup. Anyone move, you're dead. Now you, you drop your gun and you lie down slowly. - Buddy, why don't you put that pistol away before you make this any worse. (gunshot) (screaming) Let's get some money, okay? Move it! - What do you want me to put it in? - Well how about a bag? - I've got it bag, Mr. Campbell. - Oh, thanks Allison. - It's all right. - Hurry it up! (phone ringing) (door opening) - You, come away from the door and get down on the ground. - Mrs. Howard, please, just do like he said. - Let's keep it going! (dramatic music) (engine whirring) Come on. Oh shit, come on! (cars colliding) (faint police sirens) (gunshot) (tires screeching) (police sirens nearing) Drive! (footsteps) Is this you? - Yes. - What, are you wearing a wig? Who's the guy? - My boyfriend. - Boyfriend. You've got a real nice place here, Leslie. What do you do? - Teacher. - Teacher. That's nice. Teacher, teacher. I think I'd like to be a teacher. What's the matter, don't you like me? Stand up. Come on. (uneasy music) - [Officer] Can I help you? Right over there, sir. - Is this is the truck? - Yep. - No one did anything while that poor man lay on the floor bleeding to death. You know, I have never been so frightened in my life. - How are you doing? I'm Peter Resnick. - I'm Bob Emery. - Bob. - This is Harvey Johnson. - Hi. - We've been expecting you. - This id Deputy Sheriff Harrison. - Hi. - You have any surveillance tape of the robbery? - Yeah, we've got it on two cameras. - Let's take a look at it. - Is that J.D. Edinger? - Well I can't see his face, but that's his granddaddy's flak jacket. And it sure looks like his moves and gestures. - Anybody seen him get away? - Well the first radio call on the scene reported a red Mustang convertible leaving the location. - Why didn't you stop it? - [Bob] Well at the time it wasn't a suspect vehicle. We're running a make on the plates. We'll know something later today. (uneasy music) - Special Agent Johnson with the FBI. - Don't let him hear you. - [Johnson] Who? - The man who robbed the bank. - Where is he? - He's asleep. He's in the bedroom. - Is he alone? - Yes. - Is he armed? - Yes. Thank god you're here. - All right, stay behind me and show me the bedroom. - It's right at the end of the hall. (unsettling music) (groaning) - Stupid. - I want to call Tom back at the office and tell him what's going on. Do I have time before he gets them some prints? - Yeah, this should talk about another 30 minutes. - Will you call me? - Hey, I've been looking for you! - What's up? - Johnson went to check out a possible owner of that Mustang spotted at the bank. He should have checked in some time ago. - Let's go. (uneasy music) - Oh, geez. (phone dialing) - This is agent Bob Emery, 0037. I'm at 4109 Walker Drive. My partner, Harvey Johnson, is dead, a victim of an apparent homicide. And there's another victim, a female Caucasian. We'll secure the location until the team arrives. - J.D., I'm back now. I'm gonna let you out, but I gotta explain first, okay, so you don't get all crazy. I did something really great. You're gonna love this! I got us a lot, a lot of money. It's gonna be just the two of us now on the road, J.D., together. Here, here. Here, look at this. You can't do this to me. J.D., you're not like the others! You can't do this! Not to me! (semi horn) (phone ringing) - [Automated Message] You've reached the 9-1-1 police emergency network. Please hold and an officer will be right with you. - [Officer] 9-1-1, what's the nature of your emergency? Hello? - Nothing. Jesus! Hey, buddy, is this your rig? - Yes indeed. - You heading back east? - Yes sir. Why, where are you headed fella? - I'm going to West Texas. - Let me ask you something. You like Elvis? - Hell yeah, who don't? - Well if you like the King, you all right. Stick here, I'm gonna get me some coffee. I'll be right back. - All right. God damn. - Listen, you sure you don't want me to drive you? - You've got a job to do here. I don't mind taking a taxi. - Pritchard is right, you gotta get back there. I mean, if we had something to go on, some kind of a lead, I'd tell you to stick around, but as it is ... - I just don't like leaving not knowing. - Well, if anything happens I'll give you a call. - Thanks. I'm going to the airport. - Listen, Carrie. (gentle music) I'm gonna miss you. - I enjoyed working with you, Peter. - Well, if you ever get over this guy, just give me a call. - If I do, I will. - We still going hunting this weekend? - [Man] I don't know. Boss just asked me to work Saturday. Don't know if I can get out of it. - Okay, I'll wait to hear from you. 10-4. - You do any paperwork while I was gone? - [Tom] Now, Carrie, you know I get things all mixed up in that filing cabinet. - So naturally you just saved it all for me. - You are looking a little tired. Why don't you go home early and I'll handle things here. - Maybe I will. - And I promise I'll do a little paperwork. - It's all yours. Well if you hear from Resnick, tell him to call me back at the house, okay? - I still can't believe J.D. would get mixed up in something like this. - I know. I can't either. - Go on. - Carrie. Hey, Carrie, it's me, it's me, J.D.! Take it easy, take it easy. - Goddammit, J.D., I might've shot you! - I know, that entered my mind. - Well turn me loose! - All right, all right. - What are you doing here? - I'm in trouble. - No kidding? - I'm really trying to clear myself with the law. - Well you came to the right place. - What are you doing? - I'm arresting you, J.D. Turn around an put your hands behind your back. - I'm innocent! - I sincerely hope you are, now do it! - Look, come on, Carrie. This really isn't necessary. - You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and may be used against you in a court of-- - Can we talk? - You are a prime suspect in an armed robbery homicide investigation. - I know that! That's why I came to you! I wasn't near any bank, and I certainly didn't shoot anyone! - Great, well you can tell me everything in town. - Oh come on, don't treat me like a criminal. - There are warrants outstanding for you in three states. What else can I do? - You could please have just a little faith! - All right, I will. Go over to the fireplace. - What? - Sit down and cuff yourself to that gas pipe. - What are you kidding? - Go on! (cuffs ratcheting) - All right. - Now just what was your involvement with that woman? - I met her on the road the night I left here. Her car was stuck in a ditch. - And so you two just left it there. - Se was running away from her husband. She was afraid of him. - Naturally you just struck off together? - I was gonna take her as far as I was going. - How far did you take her, J.D.? - [J.D] Now what in the hell does that mean? - You slept with her, didn't you? - What does that have to do with the charges that I'm facing? - [Carrie] You you sorry bastard. - Carrie, take it easy. Will you just listen to what I have to say? - What was her name? - Patricia Harper. - Who's this? - Patricia Harper. J.D., I saw a videotape of you holding up a bank and killing a guard. - You don't understand! This is her! She has become me! She hit me over the head, she locked me in the trunk of a car, she left me in a junk yard! I don't know, maybe she thought she killed me! - You're saying this woman is passing as a man, as you? - She's crazy! She's not passing as me, she is me! In her mind she's become me! I don't know, I didn't see it coming at first because it was so gradual. But the other night she put it all together. She took my walk, she took my talk, she took my clothes, she took my hair, she took all of me! - That was your truck at the bank. People saw you! - I wasn't there. It was her. She had me locked in the trunk of a car. Hey, if I was guilty, would I come back to you? - I must be a damn fool. But I'm gonna leave you here while I go and check out your story. You better be straight with me or your ass is grass. - Why, that uniform sure does something for you. - Shut up. - What, are you gonna leave me here in the dark? - You should be used to it by now after spending all that time in the trunk of that car. - There was a trunk light. (car pulling away) (cuff rattling) (printer humming) - It just came in. Hold on, Peter. - [Peter] Okay, that's Leslie Futrell. Elizabeth might be passing for her now. We don't really know for sure. - Great. - [Peter] The only prints we lifted at the Futrell house and at the bank belong to our chameleon, Elizabeth Burrows. - Good, 'cause J.D. is here. - [Peter] What? - He showed up at my house. I left him cuffed to the fireplace. - [Peter] Why didn't you bring him in? - I didn't have the heart to haul him in in his hometown. - [Peter] I'm gonna hop a plane and come and see you. I need to have a long talk with your boy. - So Peter, J.D. is clean as far as the bureau is concerned? - [Peter] Sure looks like it. - Great. Thanks for the good news. I'll see you soon. (car pulling in) (cuffs ratcheting) (door opening) - Well it's about time. I'm getting tired of sitting in the dark here. Carrie? Who's there? - So glad to find you here. - Excuse me. - How you doing, Carrie? - Just fine, Mr. Gardner. - Steak, champagne. Looks like somebody's gonna have a mighty fine dinner tonight. - Yes, it sure does, doesn't it. (chuckling) - [J.D.] Carrie! Patricia's out there! She's got a gun! Get in your car right now and go! Carrie, please! - Hi, Carrie. Uh-uh, don't do that. Take out your gun. With your left hand. Drop it. Kick it over to me. We met before, do you remember? - What do you want? - Oh, for such a smart girl that's a dumb question. - What have you done with J.D.? - Oh, don't worry about J.D. I'm not here to hurt him. It's you and I that have the problem. J.D.'s a one-woman man. - What are you getting at? - I think you can guess. - Look, you need help, and you can get that help. All you have to do is give yourself up. - Don't. Don't do this. Come on. - Just put down the gun, and then we can talk. - Come on! I have a real nice place picked out. You'll like it. (dog barking) Bring your hat. I like it. (anxious music) (cuffs rattling) This is a nice spot. Don't you think? - I'm not gonna dig my own grave - Yes you are. Because you want to live as long as possible. (cuffs rattling) - I've taken a great interest in you, Elizabeth. - What'd you call me? - I called you by your name: Elizabeth. Elizabeth Burrows. - That's not my name. - I know what you went through. I know about your childhood. Your mother was a sick woman. Those were horrible things that she did to you. - Shut up. Shut up, I don't want to hear this. - No one blames you for what you did. - There you go again, trying to confuse me. - No, Elizabeth. I'm trying to help you forgive yourself. Your mother's death was justifiable homicide. - I don't have to forgive myself. I didn't kill her! - Your mother is dead. Now put down the gun. And I will make sure no one hurts you ever again. - Nice try smarty! Nice try! You can't trick me! My mother is alive! She calls me on the phone all the time! - We can talk about this. - Dig! (cuffs rattling) - Come on. - That's deep enough. Now, take off your uniform. You can do it now, or I can do it when you're dead. Fold it! Nicely. - [J.D Damn it! - Elizabeth, you can force me to dress this way, but it doesn't change who I am or who you are. - Get in the grave, Carrie. - Ow! (grunting) (dramatic music) - Carrie! (choking) (metal breaking) Carrie? - [Elizabeth] J.D.! - Carrie! (choking) - [Carrie] Don't move! - [J.D.] No! - J.D. you idiot! (thud) - [Elizabeth] Give me that! - [Carrie] No, no! (gunshot) (dog barking) (gasping) - J.D.? J.D.! Oh, J.D. Oh god. Are you all right? J.D.? - I'm all right, I'm all right. Are you all right? - Yes. Oh J.D., I thought we were gonna die. I love you. - Believe me, no one knows how much I've hurt you more than me. Can you stand to take me back? - Oh yeah, I could stand it.
