Bournemouth, a fashionable and beautiful resort on the south coast of England. Because of its mild climate, Bournemouth is popular throughout the area. On the east cliff overlooking the sea, lies the Green Park Hotel, the greatest name in Jewish hotels. Absolute comfort, superb service, international kosher cuisine, and every bedroom with private bathroom and shower. Book now for Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, Sukkot, Hanukkah, Purim, Pesach, Shavuot-- - Those were the days my friends. We thought they'd never end. - Wonderful people, wonderful job, and the creme de la creme came to the Green Park. Different class, absolutely different. - I was there 25 years and it was the best years of my life. - I'm 77 now. I will go back tomorrow morning. The Green Park Hotel in Bournemouth opened its doors in 1943. For 40 years, it plied its trade as the leading kosher hotel in the United Kingdom, catering to the vibrant Anglo-Jewish community, with the finest hospitality of the time. But the Green Park, as with many Jewish social spaces, also served a deeper purpose. In 2015, the global population of Jews reached pre-Holocaust levels. This incredible feat has been achieved, not by conquest or conversion, but by passing on Jewish traditions, practicing the Jewish faith, and introducing Jewish sons and daughters. Like a stick of seaside rock, you can break into Jewish culture at any point and find the same words written there. Tradition, religion, family, food. These were the values at the heart of the Green Park. The Jewish history of the United Kingdom can be divided into three distinct eras. The first era of Anglo-Judaism did not end well. The small Jewish community which had built up since 1066 was expelled from England in 1290. It was not until 1655, over 350 years later, that Oliver Cromwell issued an edict allowing Jews back into the United Kingdom. This time things went better. The Anglo-Jewish community became a key part of English life, from inventing the techniques of boxing, to financing the British Empire, to running it. The third era of Anglo-Judaism did not begin until the late 19th century. Antisemitism reached a new height with a series of violent pogroms in Poland, Russia and Lithuania. The Yiddish-speaking Ashkenazi Jews of these communities sought refuge elsewhere, traveling west to France, America, and England. The UK Jewish community increased from just under 50,000 to over 200,000. They arrived in England as strangers, with little money, and less English. This new wave of Jewish immigration settled largely in the East End of London, with further communities in Manchester, Leeds, and Glasgow. They took up lesser trades than they'd been used to, becoming bakers, tailors, and traders. But they had the energy of an immigrant population, overcoming antisemitism, educating their children, and improving their lot. The second generation of this community was coming of age in the mid 1930s, when the world changed. No enemy the Jews ever faced was greater than that which arose in Germany. Adolf Hitler and the Nazi party rode a wave of antisemitism to power and took the world towards the unthinkable, a Second World War. Separated from their European cousins, the Jews of Britain were determined to help the Allied war effort, working on the home front, and joining the armed forces in their thousands. War brought Britain together like never before. Throughout the Battle of Britain and the Blitz, people of different classes, genders, and ethnic backgrounds were thrown together to keep Britain strong. Women worked in factories. The rich were on the same rations as everyone else, and many inner city Jewish children were evacuated to the countryside for safety. War and the war effort dominated English society. But they weren't the whole story. "Keep calm and carry on" was the mantra. Children went to school and commerce continued. The young family man, Mr. Marriott, was unable to join the army because of his terrible eyesight. He had continued running his boarding house in Torquay, when he was presented with an unlikely opportunity. An Art Deco hotel suddenly became available. - My husband came to me and said do I mind if he goes to Bournemouth. I said, "To Bournemouth? "What for?" He said, "Well I've just seen an advert of a 60-bedroom, 60-bathroom hotel up for sale. Looking to grow his business, but unable to afford this grand location, he turned to his clients and his friends. - He had a word with them and said, "Would you like to come to Bournemouth "and finance me for the hotel? 'Cause I can't afford it myself." And they became. They financed him and they said, "Don't worry about it. "You'll pay us back when you can." - And with a handshake, he bought the hotel, and it was the best thing he ever did. Ruby Marriott and his wife, Sarah Richman, were both from families that had arrived in England three decades previously. Fleeing from Warsaw and eastern Poland, both families settled in London's East End. The Racjmans changed their name to Richman and worked as tailors, while the Mariovich family became Marriott, and sold furs to the English upper classes. Following their marriage, Ruby and Sarah took over the Marriott family's kosher boarding house. This was a springboard into the ambitious Green Park. The Green Park Hotel was a bet on Britain's future. But even in the midst of the war, there were still customers, although of an unexpected kind. Around half a million Jews served in the American and Canadian forces and in 1944 many of them were in the United Kingdom, preparing for the push into Europe. - A letter came which was put on the notice board. All Jewish serviceman they invited for Seder night at the Green Park. It was a vast diversity of servicemen, who were Englishmen, Canadians, Americans, the naval men from the ships in the harbor. When we got this invitation for the Seder night, I went there and 40 or 50 men at two long tables, and I was there with Michael Peters and two of the Richman girls, little table for four. A little bit obvious, but we had a very nice meal. And of course it was a full Seder night with all the trimmings. - In 1944, there was a banquet at the hotel. - Oh yes. - Just before Passover. We had to cancel all the bookings, but we also had all the food in for that period and we said, "What can we do?" We said to the Rabbi, "Can you help us?" He said, "Yes." He said, "There's lots and lots of American "soldiers here who need to be looked after. "Will you take them?" We said, "Yes." I think we had something about 180 American soldiers came and spent Passover with us. They needed the help and we needed to use this food we had, it was there. - Bournemouth was great to have fun in, because we had the Canadians there, the Americans here, the Australians here, and the English here, you see. We had quite a lot of fun. I'm not supposed to be saying that. Oh, we had to be very careful there, and very, very careful. I came from a strict family in that kind of way. So no, you behaved. You just went for the fun. The chocolate rations and the stockings or anything else they were prepared to give you. You just accepted it, it was great. - We did hear from them, those that got back home. And some of them we never saw again. This is your victory. Victory of the cause of freedom. - Commander of the regiment had the whole unit lined up on the square and he said, "Gentlemen, the war is over. "I want you to go out and celebrate. "But remember, celebrate like gentlemen." Dear Mother, I will be returning on the 4:30 train from Dover. Please don't bother to meet me at the station. I'm not sure I'm quite up for a big fuss at the moment. Aunt Sarah has offered to put me up for a week in May in a new hotel in Bournemouth. It may be just what I need for a bit of recuperation. Love, Joseph. As the war drew to a close, a discovery was made which would shame humanity, and change the course of Jewish history. Leslie Hardman, a British rabbi attached to the 8th Army Corps, was one of the first British Jews to encounter the devastation of the Holocaust whilst liberating Bergen-Belsen. For many back home, the reality of the murdered millions was almost impossible to grasp, but it was only a single generation that separated many British Jews from the dead of Europe. - The situation in Germany, as far as any of us knew, we knew absolutely nothing about it. It wasn't 'til after the war that we heard about the Holocaust and what had happened. - I'm born in Poland, 1927. And then, of course, the Russians came in. The army comes in. One side then Hitler on the other side. So we're trying to save our lives, we run to the Russian side. And of course they took us to Siberia, just to work for your death. - We used to get people in that came back to stay that had been in Belsen. And that, those, you know. They would talk about it a little bit, you know. They used to sometimes show you their number. It was very sad. - They said that my grandmother died in her own bed, but we learned a lot later that was not the truth, not the truth. They were in tremendous... The entire family was wiped out there. The tumult and horror of war had displaced thousands of European Jews. Following the Holocaust, the need for a safe Jewish state was more deeply felt than ever. As thousands of Jewish refugees made their way to the British Mandate in Palestine, this became a question that could not go unanswered for much longer. - '47, '48 was a very difficult time because British soldiers were being killed in Palestine, and what were those people killing them trying to do? They were trying to establish a Jewish state. So that's extremely uncomfortable for a British Jew in the sense that where does your loyalty lie? Does it lie with we've got to have a state to receive the Holocaust survivors? Or Britain's being messed about here and whatever. So that, I think, was very, very difficult. The tragic scene is like a serious incident during the Blitz. In July 1946, the tension between the Zionists and the British state reached its peak with the bombing of the British headquarters at the King David Hotel. - The principle of bombing a hotel, in my opinion, was absolutely outrageous. I could find no redeeming features for either side. - I mean, that was a very, very difficult time. Two of my cousins were beaten up, in English public school, were beaten up at school. It was a very tricky time. The establishment of the state of Israel in 1948, and peace in Europe, allowed the world to look to the future. Britain began to rebuild following the two World Wars. And British Jews were there to rebuild with them. For Ruby Marriott and the Richman sisters, the dream of creating a vibrant Jewish hotel, with the best of everything, and kosher, was now within their grasp. - And I knew that it was something that we could really do and make a go of it. And we did. The beginning of the 1950s saw a very different Britain to the previous decade. The National Health Service was in place. A new queen was on the throne. And the mood in Britain was hopeful. - It was a sort of moment in time which was when people had come out from the war were facing a new chapter in the history of the world as well as their own lives. There was a sense of optimism. All of that is kind of frozen in aspic in my memory, and I suspect the memory of all my contemporaries. - Post-war Britain was a very interesting place to live in. I remember as a kid going to a sweet shop with a ration card. And all of a sudden this austerity started getting lifted off. - The 1950s were an era of prosperity. Rationing finally ended in this country. You had money to spend. The war years were receding. And there were things to forget. And going to one of the great kosher hotels in Bournemouth was one way of forgetting. Dear Mother, I'm having a lovely time at the Green Park, feeling much better. It seems everyone from London is down here. I even met a nice girl. Don't tell Father. Love, Joseph. ♪ Well ♪ ♪ Sugar in the morning, sugar in the evening ♪ - I was born just at the end of the war, and grew up here in a time when Bournemouth was flourishing as a seaside resort in the '50s and '60s. The sort of resort where people came on a Saturday, and stayed for two weeks and went to the beach every day. It was completely different and it was a bucket and spade resort. - It's got beautiful beaches, it had a lot of lovely facilities, it was upper crust. It was really a lovely place to live and was considered the best place on the south coast of England, and it really was. It was very classy. - If you went to Westcliff, you were in one grade, and when you started going up, you had to look where you were going, and eventually you got to Bournemouth, 'cause that was the top. - Oh, they weren't in the same class. No, definitely. They were good, like the Ambassador and the others, they were good, but they hadn't got that something, I don't know what it was. But the Green Park was so renowned for everything about it. The way it was run, the food, especially the food, because it was all kosher. - We used to go to all of them. My grandmother liked them all, and we used to go with her to the Ambassador Hotel, the Langham, the Normandie, the Majestic, the Cumberland. But the Green Park was the business. Ruby Marriott was far from alone in running the hotel. He was ably assisted by his wife Sarah, her mother, her sister Helen, her sister Ray, her sister Judy, and her sister Hannah. Helen was the second sister to marry, leaving the hotel with her husband, Arnold, in 1956. But Ray, Judy and Hannah remained for the next 30 years. - They were the top people to run the place. Although Mr. Marriott was the managing director, he was the only man in the family. But he was the leader. So the three girls, we call them the girls even now. They were wonderful. Everyone had something to do. Miss Hannah Richman, she was in charge of the kitchen and the catering. Miss Ray Richman, she was in charge of cooking and billing, and things like that. And Miss Judy Richman, she was the youngest of the three, she was in charge of the finance. - We always helped one another. If there was anything needed, wherever it was needed, we just did that. - Yeah, we were family together. Hannah's nothing like me, I'm nothing like her, but we complement each other. - And there was never a bad word between us, not even a sharp word. And we've always got on, and that was right from birth. There's a lot of love in the whole family. For all the efficiency of Ruby and the Richman sisters, much of the character of the hotel was provided by the family matriarch, Bubba Richman. Bubba was a character of the Old World, and had little time for the Anglicized pretensions of the younger generation. - Bubba was a chain smoker. She used to light one cigarette with the previous one. Drank a bottle of champagne every night and several glasses of brandy during the day. English was not her strong suit. A person of strong opinions and not afraid to express them. She liked to play cards. In fact they said she was a terrible cheat at cards. - And had a passion for wrestling. - I didn't know that. Mick McManus was her favorite. - Oh, Bubba Richman was a typical Yiddish grandmother and mother. She was adorable. To me, she was true Jewish. She was true Yiddish, you know what I mean? She had it all and she was gonna keep it though. She wasn't gonna let it go, because that's who she was, yes. - They were just a cohesive force and they were known everywhere. Wherever you went, if you said Bournemouth, everybody would say that they knew the Marriotts and the Richmans. They really were, they were the driving force. - When we arrived at the Green Park Hotel, we were always greeted. As we came into the front door, there would be Ruby standing there with his arms outstretched. "Hello, Faye, how lovely to see you." And in turn, I would say how wonderful it is, Ruby, to be here. And we'd hug and kiss and it was like coming home. At the Green Park Hotel, all of your kosher needs will be fully met. We have separate facilities for milk and meat, our fish are all fully scaled and freshly caught in the North Atlantic. All of our meat comes straight from chewing the cud, and of course, no pork. The aim of the Green Park was to provide its guests with the best of everything. And at the heart of Jewish life, from Moses to Nigella, there has aways been food. - Yes, that's what Jewish people are well known for, is the food. - Primarily, it was about eating. - The food was fantastic. - You had breakfast, lunch, tea, dinner. And then, at midnight, tea and sandwiches were served in the late evening, in case you were feeling a bit peckish and you felt that you couldn't quite make it through to breakfast. The exquisite cuisine was made all the more remarkable by its need to adhere to the strict kosher standards of the Green Park. - There's no meat for breakfast. Only croissants, white rolls. 120 rolls for lunch, 120 rolls for dinner, 12 white loaves, six brown. So you have to keep lunch sweet and dinner sweet separate. And then you do your afternoon tea cakes, donuts, millefeuille, cream slices, Danish pastry. The rabbi came every day into the bakery and saw everything is all right. - The food was absolutely top class. And everybody had every mouth full. Someone came to me one day and said, "I don't think I can come here again. "I've put on seven pounds this week." I said, "Never mind, you'll be back," and she was. - It was in line with the times. Now maybe that's that they were particularly hungry at that time, or whether it's a way of showing your prosperity. But you went to a hotel that gave 20 meals a day. You did your daughter's wedding in such a way that there were umpteen meals during the day and nobody could say you'd been stingy. But it was definitely that era, I think, after the war. Now well-established, the Green Park was the place to be seen. Its rooms were full and its doors were always open. This unique hotel, overlooking the sea, became a nexus of Anglo-Jewish social life. The loyal guests of the Green Park were quick to adopt the luxuries of upper class English life. - I remember the very first time we stayed at the Green Park. We came along to go to the car park in our car and there had drawn up there a small van, and out of the van came racks of dresses, then a pile of shoes, you know, shoe boxes was wheeled into the hotel. One simple level is that a lot of them were in diamonds. So therefore, it was a way of showing off your stock. Yeah, I don't think it's a nasty thing. It was just basically saying, we've come out of austerity and out of an immigrant background and whatever, and we want to have the good things in life. And the Green Park became seen in the Anglo-Jewish community as one of the good things in life. Fancy dress competitions were frequent at the Green Park. The more outrageous, the better. - There used to be a competition on who dressed better than anybody else. - One day on Christmas, I dressed up, he dressed up as a baby. They pushed him in the pram and it was called the wrong pill. That won it. And a horse came through and left mess on the floor. Oy vey. - She gave permission for the horse. - I didn't give the horse the permission. Ruby gave permission for the horse to come in. - I said to Sarah, "I want to dress up as your mother. "I want to wear her sheitel. "I want to wear her clothes. "I want to wear her shoes. "Her legs are very fat. "I want to have my legs bandaged "and stuffed with cotton wool." And I had a bag with cards and cigarettes. Everybody was in hysterics and I won the first prize. - Oh gosh, you should have been there at night when they all came for Passover and things like that. Oh gosh it was hectic, but it was fun. - Jews felt very much at home in these Jewish hotels in Bournemouth. You know, you spent 50 weeks a year trying to assimilate, and two weeks a year going back to your roots. - We did have dancing every night. And we had two dancing gigolos. The women's eyes lit up when they saw they were there. If they knew they were going to have a dance, yes. It was like going to the best hotel in London. You wouldn't be better dressed in Claridge's or the Savoy. In those days the women wore jewelry. Some of it was lovely. They wanted to be queen of Green Park. Some were the duchess of Green Park, yes. - It's always the people themselves that, in my opinion, are the stars of a hotel. They don't know it, but the way they behaved and carried on, that's what made Green Park great. - The real joy of that hotel was the characters of the men and women that were there. Not us kids. These were all characters. They were self-made men. They knew what they wanted. They had stories to tell. They were characters. ♪ You gotta have a little mazel ♪ Amongst these characters were individuals who would rebuild and reshape Britain in the 1950s and beyond. ♪ You'll always have a buck ♪ - All the Jewish immigrants that came into England became integrated in society. They sacrificed a lot to see that their children were educated, and they did very well. It wasn't very many decades before there were affluent Jewish people, influential Jewish people. - They were very successful in the business and they didn't have nothing to lose, only to gain. ♪ Well you gotta have a little mazel ♪ I know the banks had confidence in them, helped them a lot - And we had a lot of the bookmakers used to come. They were well to do. Joe Coral, with the never a quarrel with Joe Coral, we had him come in. - I knew Tesco Man, Cohen. Yes, I knew him. He used to come and stay a lot. - There was a fellow from Ladbrokes used to be there as well. - And Cyril Stein. - Cyril Stein, yes. - I understand he started somewhere in London, with just a suitcase of shirts. And that's how he started his business. - The Wolfson family. Lord Wolfson, all of that family. Every single member of that family came. ♪ Well you gotta have a little mazel ♪ - Everybody played cards at the Green Park and at one stage, at the age of about 10, we were looking around the dining room for a fourth. It was David Marriott, Victor Siegel, and me, couldn't find a fourth. So Isaac Wolfson, he said, "I'll play with you boys." We sat there in the card room playing gin rummy. Everybody took photographs, and it was in the local Bournemouth paper, et cetera. The tycoon Isaac was playing with these young boys, playing cards. - They didn't, how can I put it? They didn't sort of throw that at you. Well, I'm a millionaire or anything. No, they were just ordinary people when they came, you know. - They were all people to us. But then now we realize that they were more important than we realized. ♪ And with a little mazel ♪ ♪ You'll always have good luck ♪ The high streets of today owe much to the guests of the Green Park. From the buildings raised from the rubble of the Blitz, to the stores at ground level. Tesco, Odeon, M&S, Accurist Watches, Coral. All owe their existence to the Anglo-Jewish community. The proportion of Jews to the rest of the population and what they contribute to English society today is amazing. - They were well-educated, but they were incredibly hungry and they had a real entrepreneurial spirit. And it came, I think, from that marriage of Englishness and Jewishness that was very comfortable in an environment like the Green Park actually, and at that point in time. - The overwhelming majority of Jews would try to fit in. You know, as soon as they could afford it, they'd get a proper suit, so you look like every other middle class man at work or at play, wherever you were. And you would shop at the shops that the goyim shopped at and so on. You didn't want to be noticed, because the history of these families through the post-war period were all people who had fled from persecution somewhere, one of the generations. The grandparent generation would have fled from eastern Europe or from Russia or Ukraine, whatever. Post-war, of course, those that had fled from the Nazi persecutions. You don't want to be noticed at all. So you acquire as much of the local dialect, as much of the local dress, habits, behavioral things. And we worked very hard to do that. Dear Mr. Stevenson, I'm very much looking forward to our round of golf on Saturday. I just wanted to send you the plans for the new block of flats. I really think it will lift up the whole area, and give old Adolf one in the eye, by putting up something bigger and better than what he knocked down. Kind regards, Joseph Hoffman, Hoffman Developments. At the Green Park Hotel, there is a full range of physical activities. Enjoy a round of golf at the local club. Play tennis or ping pong. And for all of you football fans, Bournemouth & Boscombe AFC is only a 10-minute walk. It's no surprise that the big betting shops grew from this community. The Jews of the United Kingdom have always had a passion for sport. - Jews and football is an interesting one. I barely know a Jewish male who isn't an avid football fan. You know, growing up all we talked about, all we did, was going to games, arguing about football, Championship Manager, the whole thing. And that does go back probably about two to two and a half generations now. And yet, Jews aren't very good at football. It was cricket more than football at first. And that was part of that aping of the upper class English manners, if you like. They still like cricket, too. Not so much rugby. Think that's a bit scary. It's the part of British culture that the Jews have taken most to their hearts, is football. - There was a lot of gambling going. The men, the women used to spend hundreds of pounds on the tables. It didn't look like, but the women used to bet on the kalooki or whatever you call it. I'm not a gambler. Mrs. Marriott was in charge of that. - And the men used to enjoy themself with the things. - Big room, Mrs. Marriott. - She was in charge. - She was the spinner. - She was in charge of the great room and the card room. That was Mrs. Marriott, organizing tables. Especially after Shabbos, the card room was full up, you couldn't get in. Everybody was rushing, we're rushing, all to get a table in the card room. - You step into the restaurant and you can see there this whiskey open all over the places. All gamblers. Every table, Jack Fisher, that one, and the other one and the other one. And they were all gamblers. Underpinning all of the luxuries and pleasures of the Green Park, was a deeply held commitment to the rituals and the religion that had been with the Jewish people for thousands of years. - I love Jewish culture. But Jewish culture will not guarantee Jewish survival. The reason is, that culture doesn't command. You read a book, you put it back on the shelf, and it doesn't call you back to it. Jewish survival depends on one word, mitzvah. Somewhere, something must command you. Call to you, summon you. And that needs mitzvah. - Oh, they observed everything. And they had a synagogue there and all the services. No question it was top, top grade. And it was very much for people who were religious and religious-conscious. - Well the synagogue we know that they took services very often, very musical. And the whole family, all the girls, Ray, Helen, and Hannah, all had beautiful voices. And they brought in such a spirit with their singing. It was really very moving. - Everybody went, everybody went. Even though the people went upstairs afterwards, the men anyway, and they were on to the bookies, placing bets on the races in the afternoon. - Their belief, their religion. And their religion keeps them together more than other people. And that's why they look after each other. - They were English, I mean, let's be honest. I mean, the majority had been born here and lived here. It wasn't a case of being English. They were Jewish, they never forgot their Jewishness, no that doesn't sound right. But you know, they never forgot that they were Jewish, and all the children were brought up like it as well. It was absolutely strict. Their religion was and still is the main thing for them. Do you think it was keeping Judaism alive in England? - I think it was an injection of absolute love of fellow man. Yes, I think it did. And I think that today we would have benefited from that hotel. I learned a lot from it. Food and sport are passing pleasures, and money's only money. But the greatest legacy of the Green Park is still with us today and will go on into the future. - It was a hotel of making Jews. You know, people married there. It's an amazing, amazing what they have done to the Jewish people. - It was a great place for mixing and matching. People went there to meet each other. Parents sent their young people there to meet their future spouses, and that's the sort of place it was. It was a great place for hatches and matches. My darling, I am so in love with you. I'm so happy in the knowledge that the love is mutual. I can't wait to see you. Everything in the world seems to be so good, at least in our world. But it frightens me. We must be truly humble, and pray for the continuation of this state of bliss and ecstasy. - I think some very good matches were made there. People were happy as a result of them. This is probably the first time in my life that all my reserve has left me, and I am able to put to paper, with unashamed adornment, my inner feelings and inner self. You are my own sweet darling, and stay that way. I love you. ♪ I love, I love, I love my calendar girl ♪ ♪ Yeah sweet calendar girl ♪ ♪ I love, I love, I love ♪ The growing wealth of the 1950s, and the growing up of the baby boomers, brought about one of Britain's most remarkable decades. The 1960s brought a wave of new ideas, new fashion, and new music. The young generation brought this with them wherever they went, even into the well-ordered life of the Green Park. - The '60s was a really fabulous time to be in Bournemouth, because we were the children whose parents, my mother in particular, had been really restricted by the wartime, by old conventions, and they were really keen for us to have a good time. We were Jewish, Jewish kids. And the Jewish hotels were flourishing. So every weekend we would be around the hotels, and meeting other Jewish girls and boys. We had a fabulous time. And it was the beginning of discotheques and fun and all the things that my parents were happy for me to do. - When we were started moving into the '60s, Britain was becoming very prosperous. There was Kings Road, there was many shops, there was those kinds of shops that were open for the spending of new spenders that were born just after the war. And that was the baby boomers, wasn't it? Of course, I was one of those. ♪ When you're on the beach you steal the show ♪ - We were free in the summer to just hang out on the beach. It was a sort of a Californian lifestyle, as far as it could be within England. - They were romantic places. You know, you got out of the city, you were there with the sea and the sand.

The Beatles themselves were thrust into the limelight by their manager, Brian Epstein, himself a regular at the Green Park. - Judges, lawyers, doctors, professors, all the lot. Musicians, everybody in every walk of life. - My father, Cecil Gee, had a very successful business. He didn't know anything about books, paperwork, offices, money. Nothing interested him, only art, creation. His challenge was to make British men fashionably dressed. He used to say, "If Beau Brummel can dress like that, "why can't people do it again?" This new energy was something of a concern for the older generation, who found their children wanting to rebel against the sedate life of their upbringing. Summer holidays in '60s Bournemouth had great appeal for those with the good fortune to be young at the time. - The '60s, I've got a glint in my eye, had their own appeal as well when you were a certain age. - We lived in a small town. Bournemouth was a small town. Bit in the sticks, there's not much near of us here. So these glamorous boys and girls came down from London to stay at those hotels. And I definitely have very fond memories of falling in love every Saturday night with a different person. The girls were all supposed to be-- - Oh, they were nice girls. - It was not okay if I stepped out with somebody who wasn't Jewish. I'm not saying it didn't happen. Oh dear me, you're bringing a smile to my memory. - I was a very attractive girl with huge braces on my teeth. One night I was in a passionate embrace with a young lad. I must have been 14 1/2? And the kiss went on forever. And then he start squealing because his lip had got caught on my hook. He was absolutely speared to me. It was like a fish. - I mean, it was more, it was call it hanky panky rather than, you know what I mean. It was a very exciting era. And you got away with everything. Oh, this is gonna come out terribly, isn't it? Oh, this is going to come out terribly. ♪ Well, well, a little bit a roll ♪ ♪ Little bit a rock, yeah ♪ ♪ A little bit a roll ♪ ♪ A little bit a rock ♪ ♪ A little bit a roll ♪ ♪ An itty bitty little bit of rock and roll ♪ The 1960s saw some new arrivals at the hotel. The Richman sisters brought in Italian waiters who would become a memorable feature of the Green Park over the next years. - I was working in Venice, and the Marriott and the Richman used to come at the Excelsior in Venice. - We were greeted by the restaurant manager. He said, "It's now the '60s. "People are traveling after the war." He said, "And my boys need to learn English. "Can you take any of our staff, the Italian boys "in your hotel?" So we said, "Yes, all right." - The restaurant manager spoke to me and said, "Would you like to go?" I said, "Yes." So he introduced me. Those days I couldn't understand a word of English. Even now I'm not that good. - Then we started getting Italian recipes, Italian cooking, and introduced all the new cooking styles. - When Mimmo came, it was unbelievable. Sensational. He took over the whole hotel. Mimmo, he could run the hotel himself. He was sensational. For the guests of the Green Park these new distractions were only part of the story. Young men and women were still encouraged to marry within their own community, and the Green Park saw many such matches. - Well, we actually met in the Green Park. Apparently, so Bernard tells me, when he saw me walking across the foyer of the hotel, he said to himself, if that girl is frum, I'm going to marry her. After dinner on Friday night, there was quite a group of young people sitting in a corner of the lounge, and I was too shy to go and introduce myself. But I said, let me just walk by, and maybe, maybe one of them will say, "Would you like to join us?" And that's exactly what Bernard did. And that's how we met. - Well, when I met Jackie I was 17 and she was 13. And how many years later? - I was 16. - We'll say three years later. Three years later-- - I was 16. At a party - It was a bit of a transformation. - A transformation, because 20 year old I was then, not very discreet, and I said, "I can't believe it. "I can't even recognize you, different person." So she said, "Well, I'm away at boarding school." Her mother had forced her onto a crash diet or something. - I ended up staying in Bubba Richman's room. The Friday night that we met, a whole group of young people, we'd all gone out for a walk. Bernard and I had ended up spending the whole time together, holding hands as we walked back. And it was quite late by the time I had gotten back to the hotel. I didn't want to wake Bubba. I remember getting undressed, actually, outside the room and just creeping in there as quietly as I could. I was so pleased that she was snoring away. But as I finally got into bed, she sat bolt upright and she said, "Where have you been, and mit whom?" And you had to answer Bubba, so I said, "Well, I've been out for a walk." "Mit whom?" "I met a young man." "Who?" "His name is Bernard Taub." And she thought for a minute and she said, "I think with this one you should "put the thumb right in." And so I did. For British Jews though, the 1960s contained more than mini skirts and pop songs. In 1967, Israel, still less than 20 years old, was in grave danger. This danger would unite Jews around the world. - Out of the horrors of the Holocaust, came this precious gift, the ability to protect yourself, a refuge, a backup. The thing that you'd been praying and hoping for for centuries and centuries. In '67, that suddenly looked like it may just be taken away. - 1967 was my first year at university. So I remember those events indelibly, and they changed the whole Jewish world. We knew they changed us in the little synagogue in Thompson's Lane in Cambridge. Every one of us who had been born after the Holocaust feared that, God forbid, we might be about to witness a second Holocaust. I mean, armies were massing on all Israel's borders. Nasser is talking about driving Israel into the sea. - People younger than a certain age don't realize what it was like in '67. I mean, when I was a kid in 1967, the sense of pride in Israel, the sense in the non Jewish community of plucky little Israel, whatever. The current situation is obviously a completely different one, but at that time I think there was huge pride in the Jewish community. I suspect if you were in the Green Park Hotel, Cumberland Hotel, the former hotels in the Six-Day War, you would have seen enormous outpouring of support. - What used to happen was that the organizations in London or anywhere, we need a lot of money. Can we have a dinner? And we'd do a dinner for as many guests as we could take. And all the donations were all sent to Israel. A disastrous defeat prompts President Nasser's resignation, which is not accepted by his people. UAR Commander, General Munam Abdul Husseini, meets with Israeli military leaders to surrender unconditionally, ending the fighting in the Gaza Strip. Nearly 600 Egyptian tanks-- - When victory came, it was absolutely amazing. I can remember when they broke through to the wall, and seeing the soldiers praying at the wall for the first time, and that lovely song, "Jerusalem of Gold" which was so evocative of those times. - After the Six-Day War, there was a wave of sympathy for Israel and then a wave of admiration for the sheer skill and the speed of victory. One thing very, very significant happened. Until then, virtually no one wore a yarmulke in public. From then, people started doing so. That was the moment that we learned to walk tall as Jews in the public square. The Six-Day War rallied the Jews of Britain to Israel's cause. The Yom Kippur War of 1973 only furthered this connection. - One of the flip sides to that was that it sowed the long-term seeds of a change of people's habits, because Israel suddenly became a place that people wanted to go to. Before the Six-Day War, it almost seemed far away, and you might have gone once in your life to see a relative, or to see the sites. Don't forget, until 1967 Jerusalem was divided. Once Jerusalem was reunited, and you could go to the holy sites, it became a much, much more attractive place for people to go to, and Israel became an alternative for holidays, for Jewish holidays and for summer holidays to going to Bournemouth. Cheap flights and the lure of predictable sunshine didn't just affect the Green Park. The whole culture of British seaside resorts was shaken by the popularity of foreign holidays. - I don't think Bournemouth would be regarded as cool anymore, I'm afraid. It would be a rainy seaside town for most months of the year. - About the same time, in the 1970s, I recall you could go for about 50 pounds a week, flight and hotel and board included, perhaps to New York or to Italy or somewhere like that. So that was the other nail in the coffin, really. Did it, in your experience, did it become emptier at the Green Park-- - Unquestionably. - There was a question of evolution. As people went more and more holidays abroad, a lot of the Jewish, the Green Park's regular customers started to go abroad more. And when they were abroad, they didn't go to the Green Park. - Green Park became a place where older people could go and spend considerable length of time and be in a kind of supervised environment where they didn't have to do anything for themselves. Their meals were always available, and they would have company from the other guests. So yes, it became a little bit Fawlty Towers-like, in that sense. - Or a bit like an old age home, sheltered housing. For the new generation of Jewish youth, separated from the original communities of the East End by 70 years, and confronted by the staggering choices of globalization, community became less about circumstances, and more about belief. - The Jewish community also became more polarized. So in the beginning we were all a fairly homogenous bunch. Fairly religious, wanted kosher food. There were always people who were more or less. But the next generation, the generation of my children, have become much more polarized. - One of the complaints that I've got with the way Anglo-Jewry is structured, is that if you're from an orthodox concept, an orthodox side of the divide if you like, that you either are in or you're not. I remember when my kids were very young, we were walking to synagogue one day. One of them said to me, "Do you believe in God?" My answer to them was that it's not for me to tell you what to believe in. That's for you to make up your own mind when you feel that you're ready. But we do live a Jewish way of life. By the mid 1980s, the Richman and Marriott families were getting on in years. The hotel was no longer as profitable as it once was, and Ruby decided it was time to move on. - Somebody came and offered to buy the place to redevelop and he decided to do it. But he came over to us and said, "I wanna tell you, "I've sold the hotel for redevelopment, "but I didn't want you to find out without "me telling you. "I didn't want you to see your hotel "being knocked down without you knowing." And so that was how it finally finished. - There was a sense of inevitability that the hotel would close. During the less popular parts of the year it was very sparsely populated-- Very quiet. And the prices were cut to such a degree that they barely made any money. All my family were getting older. I think that they all felt that short of bringing members of the younger generation into running the business, and there were no obvious candidates to do that. They had no choice but to close. - Green Park was a piece of history. And no, when they close was very, very sad. - It didn't seem possible really, that after all these years, Green Park was gonna close. We couldn't believe it. But it was the best thing Ruby had done. Over the 43 years that the Green Park was open, the Anglo-Jewish community moved from being an immigrant group, to their integral role in modern Britain. The Green Park was one of many establishments which helped foster the Anglo-Jewish identity of today. - Anglo-Jewish identity has never been particularly introspective. Jews have always been strangely subdued in Britain. I think that's a lot about the British class system. I think Jews saw the British class system and they thought right, well, we'll take a bit of the upper class sort of manner and approach to life because that seems to be the way things are done here. And we'll slip quietly in beneath them into this sort of middle class, and we'll get on, and we'll make some money, and we'll buy a house. Because that's what people do in Britain. And that's what they've done, and it's been unassuming, moderate, liberal, but remarkably successful. What does it mean to be a British Jew? It's a strangely compatible union. - I felt English, I was English, and I fought for England, which was my country. For six years, eight days, and four hours. - I think they've acculturated or assimilated in a different way to Jews from other places. There was a definite twin track of dress British and think Yiddish. - Yep, good, well-said. I think if you ask people today, are you an Englishman first or a Jew? In 2015, most people would say, "I'm English first." And I think if you'd have asked the question 50 years ago, and you've got a truthful answer, people would probably have said they were Jewish first. Do you feel English or Jewish or Polish? What's your identity? - Good question. I feel free. I think that's enough. Okay. Right, so let's begin at the beginning. The Green Park was torn down in the mid '80s, and in its place there now stands a block of flats. But across the road, in an Art Deco apartment block not dissimilar to the Green Park, live the Richman sisters, who never married. On their walls are photos of family and friends, and constant reminders of their life's work, running a hotel that exemplified all that was best about being British, and all that was best about being Jewish. The many couples that the Green Park helped introduce, and their resulting children, have strengthened the Jewish community, and carried it along its journey. - I think what we need going forward is to continually strengthen that inner sense of Jewish identity. That sense of confidence, and a complete lack of fear. There's huge danger with antisemitism returning, and a lot of hostility to the state of Israel. The Jews will want to hide their identity again, and it's a big mistake. We should have the self-confidence to walk tall as Jews, to continue to be proud, to seek to continue to be knowledgeable, to deepen our Jewish practice, while at the same time not retreating into a ghetto of our own making. Because, really and truly, we become stronger when we share our blessings with the world. And yes, we need new places like Bournemouth hotels, like the Green Park. Whatever the 21st century throws up by way of those places, we need places where young Jews can come and meet and fall in love and somehow or other build a Jewish future of which we can be proud.
