It's a treat today. Just a fish. Better than nothing. Yukino. Thank you. Kuro. Good morning. It's the last clay of our shop. The old bitches in Parliament enacted the law. They banned prostitution to "benefit" you. But it's you who need it, I've been taking care of you. They'll just throw you out. But I'll offer you a helping hand. I'm planning a new business. A Turkish bath. A Turkish bath? What's a Turkish bath? I'll rent each one of you a room with a bath. Use it freely. You can make love to your customers. Will you do it? Hey, everyone I'm sure you'll do it. I will. But working all clay in a bath... - my body will get clamp. - I know. You get wet anyway. Ma'am, I'll do it. Suzuyo? YES. Michi? I will. Will you, Yukino? Yukino, will you do it? Answer. I'll quit, ma'am. I won't do it. How dare you! You're in debt to me. YES. What are you going to do? The law says you're clean, but you can't walk out on us. She's married. She'll be deserted sooner or later. She looks gentle, but she's as stubborn as a mule. A dog that bites her master's hand. Work hard, girls. It's the last night. Yes! I'll service you. Ayami, come here quickly. Here I am. - Welcome. - Just in time, 10 minutes to go. It'll be midnight soon. Thank you very much. Public Prostitution Ended Yukino, you forgot this. It's goodbye.

Happier than the others. Darling, I have a request. What is it? Can I live with my sister? Sister? Bring her. We can live together. Darling, thank you. Hey, you bastard! You stole our money. You filthy bastards! Bastard! Please stop it! Stay back. - Please stop it! - Shut up! He deserves punishment. He stole 500,000 yen. 500,000? - What'll you do? - Where is it! If you can't pay it back, I'll beat you up. Come! Wait! You rented this place with that money? Lay off! Please wait. I'll pay it back. Turkish Bath Maihime Price List Welcome. 3 people?

Oh, Well... A dress? No, thank you. - Why not? - I'll make one. She wants to work for a dressmaker. But making a dress isn't so easy. I can't let you spend money on me anymore. Don't worry about that. You can thank me later. Here's Kuro, be nice to her. What a lovely cat! Here... Yukino, it's time to leave. I'll be going. Take care of my sister. Sis, where do you work? A friend of mine runs a shop. I help her out. Yukino... Darling... Yukino... What? I'm in debt again. It's the same gangsters. Debt? Yeah. I wanted to redeem you. I gambled. How much? A million. A million! I'll leave Tokyo for a few years. They'll forget. A few years? Wait for me. I'll be back. No! I can't live without you. We have to. There's a way, but... It's too much to ask. No, tell me. I'll do anything for you. You love me so much? Of course. We're a couple. I shouldn't ask you this, but... If you live in the Turkish bathhouse, they'll give you a loan. I'll ask them. I'll do anything for you. Yukino. I'll never leave you. You're mine. Darling, take care of my sister while I'm away. Please. This is for her three years service. Her monthly earnings will be shared equally by us. Is it a deal? Thanks. You're a wicked man. She trusts you blindly. Madame, you're in the prime of life. You want an affair? - It's snowing. - Cold! Shall we have a drink and watch the snow? Bring sak√©. Yukino, have a drink. Ah, tasty. What's wrong? You're pregnant, aren't you? Pregnant women can't work. You want to keep this job? Go to a doctor. Get an abortion. Mayumi. - No! No! - Mayumi. Stop it! What are you doing? Stop! No! I said no! I said stop! Stop! Be quiet! Mayumi! Stop! Mayumi! I'm back. Yukino. What's wrong. You didn't... Sis, get a divorce. Divorce? Leave him. He molested you? How could you? How could you? She's my precious sister. You raped her and destroyed her future. I don't want her to be like me. I want her to be decent and happy. You know she's my dream, don't you? It's clone, forget it! What? Stop it. You're all right. Stop it. Sis, stop it! You, all right? Good. You shouldn't have clone that. I'm sorry. Forgive me. Don't leave me. Darling, forgive me. Mayumi! Mayumi! Let her go! Don't! Your baby is in here. My baby? I want to have this child. Your child. Did you come back to tell me that? Damn you! Don't be a fool! Go back to the shop! That hurts! Kuniko. You insult our most valued customers and tarnish our shop! Stop it! Don't hit my belly. Darling, finish her off. You're cruel! It's your baby. Your own baby! Shut up! How do I know it's mine? Darling, is she dead? Shut up! Nobody'll find out. If you keep quiet. It's clone. Madame, we're partners. Nothing can separate us now. It's written. Darling. Madame. Madame. Darling. A few months later "Turkish Bath Hostesses Wanted" Thank you very much. Please come back. I'll be back. Thank you very much. - Your sign... - Huh? You want hostesses? You want a job? Really? Come with me. I'm hereto teach you how to massage. You're beautiful. I've searched high and low for a babe like you. Here I am. Come in. Please. Take off your panties. How to massage. Now... Lesson one. A man's most sensitive parts are here and here. You don't have to tell me that. You surprise me. I'm offended. I'm supposed to teach you. Show me how good you are. What can a little girl do? Oh, good! What a feeling. Mummy! - Welcome home. - It's cold. Welcome home. How was the meeting? It was grand. The boss was elected executive again. We decided to raise the fee. Is that right? Manager. Yes? Come in. The new hostess. The boss. The manager. I'm Mayumi, how do you do? We're off, see you. Good job, take care. Boss, we had lots of customers today. Idiot! You must get more. More Turkish baths will be built. We'll have many rivals. Work harder. Darling, I warmed your bed. Good night. I hate that old fool. He's off to iron the bills. Let him have his fun. He thinks I'm his slave. You can have your fun. He has a crush on the new hostess. She wants to be a live-in hostess. It's unusual. Do you know who that girl is? She's Yukino's sister. Don't worry. Whatever her plan is, I'll tame her. You earn a lot. What'll you do with it? I only trust money. You've changed a lot in just six months. I had no choice. I was left alone. You had a man? Mayumi, I've been waiting for you. Cut it out. You owe me. You took my cherry. It'll cost you. Pay me now. I'll teach you a new technique I learned in Osaka. This is called the bubble dance. Good, eh? Your turn. Good. That's nice. Use your brush. Like this? Ow, that hurts. I didn't mean that. Your "hair brush". That's fine. Yeah, excellent. Looks pretty empty today. Beautiful marbling. Whoops. I took a wrong turn. Crowded as ever on this train. Suicide is not allowed. Don't look. February Personal Results She stole my customer. I'm mad. She's for sale and proud of it. She stole our customers. The boss, too. You're too docile. Mayumi, you have a customer. Wait. You're new here, but you act big. Don't be so full of yourself. We've been in this business for years. We're professionals. Veterans. Right! Bitch! Don't try to beat us. Be obedient. Every morning... We can't let a thief work here. Bitch! Kuro! Kuro! Kuro! Kuro... Kuro, where were you? Where'd you come from? Kuro, where did Yukino run off to? It's been six months. Sis... Kuro... Kuro. Where'd you come from? Mayumi, you should take a rest once in a while. Money isn't as important as health. You're kind as usual. I wanted to be alone with you. In the shop, we can't. But you're intimate with the Madame. She's too old for me, don't you think? You're the one I really love. If the boss hears of your affair with her, he'll be mad. Hold me. Mayumi. You're the best. You were my first man. You're good. I'm proud of you. You could be a professional pianist. I must go to Osaka. I'll be back before your concert. You're kind to Mayumi lately. Don't go too far. Don't worry about that. She's popular. We must treat her nicely. The boss? That stingy old fart! He loves his daughter. I can't wait any longer. I want to live with you as soon as possible. Don't be hasty. I'll get rid of him. Then the business will be ours. What are you doing? Oh, boss. Shikauchi, you can have the bitch. Take her away. Get out of here! What did you say! Boss, please stop it! You won't get anything, even if you kill me. This shop and money belong to my daughter. Damn you! Outta the way! Hold that side. His hand. Hurt? I have to marry Shikauchi? Your father's orders. He wants you to marry him before he comes back. I refuse. You're stubborn. But you have to marry him, like it or not. Marriage license... You don't have to sleep with him, though. Are you, all right? Don't touch me! Father! Father didn't go. It's me. What did you do with father? Your father? He didn't go to Osaka. Don't worry about him. Listen, Natsuyo... From now on, you're my wife. Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Forgive me. Stop it! The real estate, stock and money. They're worth 150 million yen. If you try to double-cross me, you'll be sorry. I won't do that. You're my mother-in-law. We're partners. What's that? A cat! A cat! It's nothing. What is it? Darling! His arm! Who is it? It's Yukino's cat. Darling! It's Yukino's hair pin. She was killed here. What are you doing? What were you doing in the shed? Speak up! - You act big. - You deserve this. Bitch You were snooping around. What's wrong? Darling. Over there. Help! It's a game of a man and three girls. Let's enjoy ourselves. You're the first. Wait a minute. Come, come. Please, welcome. Yes, like that. Foot race. Go for it! I'll never let you go! - You double-crossed me! - Shut up! God dammit! You betrayed me. You won't get away with this. Get off me! At last we're alone. Mayumi, we have a lot of money. Let's leave here and live happily. OK. Let's drink to our happiness. - Cheers. - Cheers. We have no more obstacles. We can enjoy our lives. Mayumi. I'm good at massage. The best. It's like I'm going to heaven. Not to heaven. To hell! You remember this? I came here because I thought you killed my sister. You're not a man, but a beast. You'll die! Sister... The End
