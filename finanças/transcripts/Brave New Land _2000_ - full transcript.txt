PRESENTING THE KADIWÃ‰U COMMUNITY "BRAVE NEW LAND" Antonio! Come here. - Get some men to give us a hand. - Nice shot, Captain! Nice shot. - Have you ever seen this animal? - I've seen it... in a drawing in Coimbra. Well, they don't need a village with wooden houses. They accept, but they say the wood is too hard to cut. - They also say this is slave work. - What about their slaves? You didn't get it, Commander. They don't want to grow corn or live in wooden houses. You want that. Why don't you send your slaves to do it?! That's all, Commander. Let me tell you, Sir... The problem with this land besides those dogmeat Spaniards... are these tiny little creatures with their itching bites. The mosquitoes might still bother us but the Spaniards no longer. This mission'll prove all land up to Paraguay River belongs to Portugal. A map goes up, a treaty comes down... it's just tit for tat. Dom Diogo... this is a boa. A baby. Its mother is not far away... ouch! There's a bigger one: the anaconda. When it grips an ox... it will swallow it alive. It won't fit in your little bottles. Jose, come here. Hurry up! Let the snake go. Don't kill it. Very interesting... Dom Diogo... this land doesn't belong to those who sign treaties and documents... but to those who don't fear its creatures, be it God or the devil. I think we'd better invoke God only. Until we reach Fort Coimbra, let Satan mind his own business. Fort Coimbra, the year of grace 1778. Your Excellency, Governor of the Captain ship of Mato Grosso: Regarding the Guaicuru Indians, I'm optimistic about a peace treaty. Despite the refusal of our offers to help them build a settlement... I think we'll soon succeed in reeducating Indians. Holy Mother of God! Let me help you, Sir. Near the smoke, the mosquitoes won't bother you that much. Thank you, Antonio. We're already in the Horsemen Indians' territory. They know all about the plants and rocks you've been collecting. Even more, but it's impossible to talk with them. Are they really that dangerous? I've heard a peace treaty is under way. Peace treaty? Only in your dreams! One day, they side with us against the Spaniards. The next, they join them. They lie as they breathe! The mosquitoes don't bother them. Your skin, Sir, is too sensitive to the plagues of this land. The Horsemen can hardly be seen. Five years ago, they slaughtered some Spaniards... who were traveling downstream in boats full of silver. They threw the silver in the river and kept only swords and machetes! People have been plunging into the river since then. Up till now... to see if they can find any silver. I know a Frenchman who'd enjoy this story. He says the New World savages, natives from the Americas... who live in harmony with Nature... are morally much stronger than Europeans. - Morally stronger! - He goes further... he says we'd better not try to civilize the natives. They might end up like us, killing each other out of greed... ...for a handful of gold. - This Frenchman must be crazy. He's probably never been in the colonies! The Indians I know do nothing but drink, eat, fuck, steal and kill. - People do that. - People? They're devils! And the priests say they're sons of God... They're not even sons of the devil. They're all sons of bitches! Come here! Drink! Drink, you animal! Repeat: "I am a son of a bitch". Say it: "I am a son of a bitch". - I am... -...a son of a bitch. ...bitch. - Drink! Antonio, wake up the master. Sir! Sir! I hardly got any sleep. I had chills and thirst. You'll get used to it, Sir. The fever will soon be gone. How long have you been living here, Mr. Antonio? You know who I am, Sir? Yes. I know you used to be Duarte Jos?Pereira's attendant. The richest New Christian in the colony. Did you meet Dom Duarte in Portugal, Sir? No, I was just a child when he was... Executed? ...burnt at the stake by the Inquisition. But everyone said he had found gold and silver mines in the colonies. That's exactly what I'd like to talk to you, Sir. This is a map... to one of those mines that were never located. Dom Duarte... may his soul rest in peace... gave it to me. If you would be kind enough to help me, Sir... Move on! Thank you. Antonio came back dreaming about the silver mountain. I've seen so many people die trying to find it... What about the map? What map!? The Jew made it up! Everyone knows it leads nowhere. The landmark is a bell-shaped mountain no one has ever seen. It could be a code. The secret burnt with the heretic, then. It's easier to find silver... near the Cuiab?River, Santana de GoiÃ¡s, the Almas River. Tell me, Captain, you know this land so well... how come you didn't get rich with gold, silver, or diamonds? Hey, let's go faster! We'll stop by the waterfall. Is that all you can do, Sir? Have you ever grabbed some tits? A man can either draw or grab them, Captain. A real man has always to prove he's a man. The Indian girls here smell much nicer... than the colored girls in town. Very soon, you'll understand what I mean, Sir. Trust the Captain's word. Son of a bitch! Get that one over there! Come on! Don't let anyone escape! Over there, hurry up! Sons of a bitch! Perverts! Sodomites! Let's show these sodomite wretches... they're dealing with real men! This is catechism! Real catechism! For God's sake, stop crying! You're not different from anyone else, Sir. All of this here is because of you! Prove now you're a man! So? Are you afraid? No! Not that one! You dropped this... Captain! Look what I found hiding in the woods. - Come here! - It's a boy. A white boy! While the Governor talks about peace these motherfuckers steal our kids! Francisco! Take care of the boy. Take him! Let's go! My dearest beloved... we're near Fort Coimbra where I'll stay for a long time. I've been crossing lands and rivers on end. Such large rivers, dense forests, and endless fields... that we stare in wonder. Let alone the diversity of plants and animals. We had our first skirmish with the savages... Antonio... I want you to untie the boy to start taming him. Captain! I'm taking her with me. Hurry up with that. Good morning and welcome, Dom Diogo de Castro e Albuquerque. Good morning, Commander. I'm glad you'll carry out the measurements. Thank you. But why did you bring captive Indians? Captain Pedro can explain it to you. He's in charge of my escort troop. They're not captives, Commander. The boy isn't even an Indian. He's white. Look at him. He must've been kidnapped by the savages. The woman is Indian. Dom Diogo asked to bring her along. Matias, Dom Diogo's lodging! Follow me, Pedro. How many did you kill this time? The problem is they weren't all women. I thought they were! But there were some "she-males" who attacked us first. You thought they were all women... How many did you kill? Well... ...myself... - Captain Pedro! Altogether? About ten... Altogether about ten! Did you forget the peace treaty? But they attacked us first! No one ever believed in this treaty stuff. So now besides murdering and seizing Indians... you think you know best about political matters? I've already told you you're white. You can't go on acting as if you were this Indian's slave. Understand? White! You're white. For the time being, you can keep that princess look on your face! Jorge, LuÃ­s! Come here. Take this fucking Indian to Dom Diogo. Soon you'll understand things better. First, I'll teach you how to speak! No, that's not a human language. I'll teach you a human language. You'll like it. It's much nicer than these animal grunts. Then you'll be able to tell... right... from wrong. I think you should start by measuring across the river. So far, we can still protect you. I'd rather take a look at the previous reports first. - Are the Horsemen really dangerous? - Dangerous? When the Spaniards first came... the Guaicuru fought the great Cabeza de Vaca. Then they learned how to tame our horses. Ever since, they've harassed whoever tries to settle down. - The ones we saw? - No. But they're all alike. They share the same language and traditions. They claim to be "noble warriors"... just like patricians and generals in ancient Rome. The children they kidnap are taken to their villages, raised as slaves. Like this boy Pedro brought. - And they don't rebel? - No, on the contrary! They love their masters. Didn't you see how the boy respects his Indian mistress? Like a faithful servant to his mistress. - As if she were a great dame. - Absolutely. She is a great dame. That's why her body is all adorned. For them, it is a sign of nobility. Consequently, Dom Diogo... you're also marked for what you did to "your princess". Or at least for what I suppose you did. I'm still confused about what really happened. It was as if... I had no choice... and it was the only thing to do. Whatever corrupt and perverted ideas lust can put into man's lewd mind... is practiced by these Indians. if that wasn't enough... there are among the Guaicuru a few men widely admired... called "Cudinhos" who serve them as women. The "Cudinhos", or obnoxious demons, dress and behave just like women. They talk like them and do the same chores women do. Even crouch to pee. And, once a month, they pretend conspicuously... to have their period, avoiding fish and meat... eating only fruits or hearts of palm. Since you're mine, let's do something. This is for you to wear. Hold it. This is for you, too. As you please, your Highness. Anote...? I'll show you my map. You're beginning to understand! Here, you see? The river bed, the waterfall... the bell-shaped mountain... ItaguaÃ§u. A tall silver mountain! Have you seen it? Itapetinga, white stone. Silver. Understand? Silver... do you understand? Silver just like that, silver... - This one. Silver. Silver. - Antonio! Everybody knows... the silver they have was stolen from the Spaniards, you idiot. You don't understand, do you? It's useless... Keep this, since you like it so much. Now get lost. Go... Go! As soon as the priest gets here you'll be baptized with my name... Pedro. Got it? Pedro, my own name! Pe... dro. Pe... Io. That's not bad... Because it was me who saved your life, right? -"ight". - Right. I knew you were smart. I'm going to give you a present. For good. This is our Lord. Repeat: Our Lord... Jesus Christ. -"Chlist". - Right, very good! It's yours. Keep it. "This land... is gorgeous... and strange... like you? Anote, look. Look. Hold it. Hold it! Too heavy, alright. How about this one? Come on. Hold it. Here. Not like this. Place that jug over there. Boy shoots. There, get that jug. Put it over there. Good. Come back. Let's try it. Here, hold it. Hold it tight! That's it. Look through here and aim over there. Let's do it? One... two. Aim. You missed it. Next time. Next time. You need to practice more. One... two. Anote? Why do you paint your face? Paint... face. Why? Monkey? You want a monkey? Am I a monkey? I'm a monkey... because I have hair on my face. And you paint yours because you don't. Because you're human... No, I couldn't do that. Hold on! Anote, look. Anote. Anote. Diogo. Thank you, Maria. You can go. Feeling better, Father? Thanks for asking. I'm really sorry, Father. I knew this would happen sooner or later. But it was too late to ask for reinforcements. Not even a thousand soldiers could fight back those evil beasts! God was the one who took pity on me and my mission. That's why I'm still alive. Is cutting off the enemies' hands their tradition? Tradition?! How could savages have traditions, Dom Diogo? - These demons... - You mean our demon, Father. They were used to cutting off their dead enemies' ears. But 15 years ago an officer decided they deserved another treatment. After defeating a bunch of Indians who were hunting... he cut off their hands! They were still alive. He spared one to spread the news that white men had a new leader. I agree, Commander. It wasn't a very Christian act. But that's your problem. The Church has no say in military affairs. Is it loaded? Pedro. How could you do that to our Lord Jesus Christ?! I'll teach you to be respectful to Christ. Got that? Put this on. Don't move until I say so. I know you can understand me and you know those people's secrets. All I want to know is where they get the silver, got it? We'll prove to them the mines do exist. Right, little brother? Go get yourself some brown sugar candy. Go. Ever since I laid eyes on you, I knew you'd lead me there. "Animal?" Yes, that's what I am. If you came for a masquerade... wrong palace! And it seems your princess lost her slave. Where are you, boy? Come back! I'll give you much more... than you've ever dreamed of! You want part of my mines? I'll give it you! I'll do it. Come back! Fucking cripple! What have you been up to? Which way did the boy go? You wretch! - Don't do that, Captain! - You traitor! - And to think I taught you to shoot! - He's dying! - Son of a bitch! - Give me the boy. Get out of here, Antonio! He'll take me to the mines. Don't do that, Captain. - Antonio, get out of here. - I've done so much for you... Captain... Captain, don't make me do this! Are you crazy?! Commander, you can't release Captain Pedro! He acted in self-defense. I'm releasing him! You'll never reach peace with Pedro around! I'll put it in my report to the Governor. No one asked your opinion, not me nor the Governor! Do your job and don't interfere with ours. - And the peace treaty? - You forgot how your romance... with the princess started? If after that, there can still be peace... it'll make no difference whether Pedro is free or not. If the Indians wage a war, I'd rather fight with him by my side. I read in a report you wrote... this land is for the peacemakers with the Guaicuru. It can be either ours or the Spaniards'. It's amazing. The Indians may not keep their land... but they'll decide on who will. I guess the boy... meant a lot to you. Boy... - Januya? - Januya. Did you forget today is Saturday? Forgive me, Father. In this land, you lose track of time and the fasting precepts. No offense to God! I've been eating fish for days. This is my first decent meal. My body needs it. Then save it for tomorrow. Very well, Father. I've heard you're living in sin. Well, Father... it's also hard to tell what is really sinful here. What do you mean "hard", Dom Diogo? The Bible is very clear! - So is the Church's doctrine! - Neither mentions these savages. No one knew about them. You're mistaken, Dom Diogo. The Church is reviewing its position due to these issues. As you know, there were no colored men in Noah's Ark. But, since there has to be a reason for everything... with some caution and plenty of research, the Church scholars... got to the conclusion... the Deluge took place in one part of the world only. The other half, where Indians and Negroes probably were... was not affected. Do you know how the Horsemen describe their origin? They were created by a bird to wage war on Earth. Interesting, isn't it? In the name of His Majesty, the King of Portugal... we're celebrating masses in the most remote territories of the kingdom... to honor the engagement... between Prince Dom Jo, heir to the throne... and Dona Carlota Joaquina of Spain. Forgive me, Lord. I didn't expect this outcome... but be sure my child'll be a Christian. It shall be the best this New World will ever breed. It will bear my abilities... and her purity. Everything's ready, Commander. We're leaving at dawn. Gentlemen, let me give you my blessings. Father. Have a nice trip, Father. May God forgive all your sins. Captain, this dreadful heat will follow us all the way to Vila Bela. I thought the rain would ruin the passages. When it rains, the Guaicuru can't ride their horses. The expeditions can't come from the south. But you can reach Vila Bela... by boat. Otherwise the fort would be isolated. Haven't we been isolated? This doesn't seem to bother you very much... No, it doesn't bother me. I don't feel guilty. Living beyond boundaries has always fascinated me. That's not my case. I am Portuguese. I came here with the purpose of learning only. I was sure to return to Portugal... to Coimbra, to my fiancÃ©e, to the court. How about now? Could you return with your mestizo children? That's impossible. I'm not going back. My beloved... the work is consuming all our time. That's why I haven't written. Little by little, I begin to understand these civilizations. It's an extremely pleasant feeling... as if we could be part of different worlds. For the sake of Jesus Christ's dick which is now pissing on me! To Captain Pedro, who delivered us from the drought! Listen, Dom Diogo... new women arrived at Vila Bela coming from Rio de Janeiro. They're white. Truly white! They're all Portuguese. This time, I think I'll have a Christian son. You know what will make him different from me? - No. - No? He'll be a certified white Christian. Some more wine? Please, Dom Diogo. Dom Diogo... my great-grandmother was an Indian... but on my mother's side only. She was a quad... How do you... - What is it called? - A quadroon. That's it, a quadroon! But, from then on, they were all white. Just think... bear with me... But my son's blood will be pure. He'll be a certified white by law, the Church and the crown. Captain Pedro, to your son! Anote... Anote... Talk to me. Anote... Anote! Where's the baby? What happened, Anote? Anote lost the baby and she won't tell me what happened. Why are you laughing, idiot!? Just because she's an Indian? So you don't know why your wife lost her baby? - He doesn't know, Commander. - Stop it! Let's talk in my office. Why? Everyone knows what happened. - And what happened? - Listen carefully... and you'll learn more about these savages. These women kill their babies when they feel like it. Either they kill them in the belly, or when they're born. Liar! It can't be true! It is true, Dom Diogo! Each one of them has just one child. And it seems like she doesn't want to have your heir. - Bastard! - Stop that! You animal! How could you do that? You're an animal! What you've done is not human! Do you understand? - Since when have they done this? - They always have! As warriors, they can only flee carrying no more than one child. More than one child could hinder their flight. And all the women agree with that? Why do you refuse to accept it as a fact? It's said they prefer it that way so it won't ruin their bodies. It's all wrong! It's all unnatural! I hope for the rainy season to end soon... so I can return to our land's peacefulness... for which I long so much when I feel restless. The colony can be no more than a passage in our lives... a difficult and tortuous learning experience. Commander! Commander! - Commander, good-bye. - I'll be waiting for you, Father. I shall come back. They know they can't withstand Portuguese and Spaniards altogether. They promised to bring us gifts as a token of friendship. It is not possible to have peace here! You know that. Of course it is. The rain seems to have washed away all the hatred. Fortunately. You are in charge of receiving these gifts. Captain, as a token of the Guaicuru's friendship... they offer you pelts as gifts... as well as their women, so you get to know each other better. As you know, this is not very Christian. Oidatelegute says the Captain will enjoy the gifts very much. PHILOSOPHICAL JOURNEY TO THE CAPTAINSHIP OF MATO GROSSO BY DIOGO DE CASTRO E ALBUQUERQUE That's how it ends our old song of war. I can sing other stories... both good and bad, of the Guaicuru. But they are the songs of today. The wars of today. "In 1793, 12 years after the massacre at the fort... the Guaicuru signed a peace treaty with the Portuguese crown. Of all their descendents, the KadiwÃ©u are the only survivors. Today, about 1000 live in a reservation in Mato Grosso do Sul? To the KadiwÃ©u, who survived. SUBTITLES VIDEOLAR
