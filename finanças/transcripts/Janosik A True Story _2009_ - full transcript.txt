THE BORDERLAND OF POLAND AND IN PRESENT DAY SLOVAKIA. THE UPRISING LED BY FRANCIS RAKOCZI AGAINST THE HABSBURGS IS DYING OUT... IMPERIAL TROOPS ARE HUNTING DOWN THE LAST OF THE INSURGENTS. JANOSIK The True Story Have a drink. Voivod! Run! Farewell Janosik! Thanks! Didn't you know that Rakoczi was a traitor? A rebel who betrayed the Emperor? Didn't you know that his men are rabble who deserve to die? They said we had to join them. I don't know anything about the Emperor. Officers rode into our village and press ganged us. I know. They told you it was an uprising against the thieves who oppress you, and you were stupid enough to believe them. But the Emperor is generous. He forgives those who show remorse. You'll be able to pay the Emperor with your loyal service. Those of you who pass the muster will become troops of the Emperor. I don't understand ... You'll serve in the castle guard. They've already killed eleven, And left one in fetters ... Lie here Janek, all alone, To be tried by your betters. Don't you hang me on an oak, Ravens for my eyes to poke, Rather hang me on the elm Over by the village well. When my love comes fetching water She will chase the birds away.; Shoo, birds, shoo! Don't peck at my love so true! Shoo, you filthy birds, take flight! Don't peck at his flesh so white. The prisoner's escaped! What? You know who that was? That was Tomas Uhorcik. The outlaw! You know how long it took me to catch the knave? Three years! How could he escape? Maybe he had a magic thread in his belt. Cut it and you're free. Brigands have herbs that can open any lock. And this? Did he cut the iron with the stem? Why do you keep chewing on that grass? Because it tastes sweet. Here's the money to buy my son out, and his clothes. A pistol at my belt, an axe in my hand, No one will get the better of me! Anusia! Wait! Let me count your petticoats, so you know how many you have. One... two... three... four... five... six... - seven... - I'll get cold. Don't worry, I'll keep you warm. Eight! Jurko! I'm getting married. To Michal Krzysztofik. The banns have been posted. It's true! Why didn't you tell me earlier? I wanted to, but when you got back, and when I laid eyes on you, I felt such a hankering. Greetings, Juro! Tomas! Let me take a look at you. You're finally back to normal. Warm yourself up. Helena got a fire going. I can't wait for spring to come. This winter is no good. I need to lay low and there's no work. Work? Briganding is work like any other. I just want some peace and quiet. Four years fighting the war. I don't want to worry anymore. About killing someone or what some woman dreams up. I thought you'd go out on the highway with me. I took a job as a herdsman. You're too good to be herding! What's wrong with you? Hey, boys! The brigands are coming! Janosik! Why are you so squeamish? Briganding is a good trade. You're free, you answer to no man. And you can have whatever you please!... If I didn't go briganding, I couldn't have given your father the money to buy you out of the army. See, if it wasn't for the outlaw Tomas Uhorcik you'd still be rotting in the ranks. - Who's that? - Katka, the foreman's daughter! He's hit it! My grandmother, who's nearly a hundred years old, says that you have to not want something if you want to get it. But when you want something real bad, the devil will jinx it. Try without the axe! Juro! Juro! If that's the way you think, I feel sorry for you! - He's hit it! - You're good, Huncaga! Who'll try? I'll... give it a try! You? A shepherd? I'll hit the heart the angel is holding. - He's hit it! - Hit what? Straight through the heart! Well I'll be a bishop's uncle if that wasn't a lucky shot! Might have been lucky! Show him it weren't no lucky shot. Huncaga deserves a swift kick in the pants! I'll hit the flag on the tower! Where twelve brigands lie! Did he hit it? He hit the flag! - I'm Biernat. - Satora You've done me proud, my boy. No, no... it's yours. - You were with Rakoczi? - I was. And I would have stayed with him if the Emperor's troops hadn't broken our company up. You cook for sheep in this shelter? It's a bran and wine poultice. Want to try it? What's it for? Our ram's hurt. Now rub it in. How? Like this? Midsummer's Night 1 7 1 1 Hey nonny, nonny, we're burning Johnny, Up in flames Saint Johnny goes, Grabbed up by a flock of crows! Up in flames Saint Johnny goes, Grabbed up by a flock of crows ... Momma! What are you doing here, you brute? Get into a fight with the foreman? No, I'm going back to the shelter tomorrow! Come, let's look for flowering ferns. We can split the pot of gold. Come on! She's drunk. They're all in their cups. Come look for ferns with us! Leave him be. There are more interesting things to do tonight than looking for hidden treasure. Right, Juro? How have you been Anusia? Don't think it's yours! I wish you well, Anusia! Come! This place is cursed. Soldiers burned it down. And it's haunted by a hanged man. You wouldn't be here if you believed that. I'm not scared of what I believe in - And of me? - No... Katka, I can't live like this any longer. I wish I was someone else. I wish I didn't have any outlaws under my command, no gold; I wish my name wasn't Tomas Uhorcik. All I want is you and my face! Do I still look like an honest man? You do when you smile! Look! It's a good omen. It doesn't look too jolly. It's a sign I should do what I intend to. I had no idea you were so good, Juro! You're lucky I recognized you. I could have strangled you! You're just the man, I need... You beat me fair and square. What are you doing here? You know how to read? They taught me in the army. Find me Marcin Mrowiec. I need to know when was he born and what his parents and godparents were called. He must be about my age. What do you want to know that for? He was kidnapped by the Turks as a child. Together with his parents. I heard the story. And now Marcin Mrowiec is coming back. Beautiful... Let me take a look at these. What about this one? German-made! Do you have it in another color? Listen, Tomas, what did you drag me out here for? What do you mean what for? I'm buying cloth to take across the mountains. There's brigands in those mountains. You'll protect me and my cloth from them. The red one's good... Let me see! I need to choose something. I'm getting married, I need cloth. I've always taken the best merchandise. This one's moth-eaten. Here and here. No. That's impossible. You know, maybe the green one will be good ... Juro! Let's spread it out. Mind if we try it on? Turn around. Take the chest! I didn't know you could play the bagpipes. How long have you been playing the fiddle? - Since I was a child. - Me, I was born holding a bagpipe. Satora! I'll never get used to calling you Marcin... - I'll call you My love instead! - That I don't mind! Why did you talk me into it, if you're leaving? Tomas Uhorcik isn't leaving his company in the best of shape. - But he's leaving it a good captain. - Tomas, stay! That new captain is Juro Janosik, once a soldier and herdsman, now a brigand. I never wanted to be a brigand. You know that. Juro Janosik must not want something in order to get it. Isn't that what his grandma said?! We'd like to wish you plenty of luck, Tomas. Thank you, Huncaga! This is Margeta! She's... she... she sees everything. If you want, I'll tell what's in store for you. I can charm love and death. Cast spells and read palms. It's free today. Shall I? Go on then, Margeta. Read! Eight of cups, parting... a heavy heart. Lot turning his back on Sodom. You're leaving what's dear to you and set out into an uncertain future. You're leaving of your own free will, but maybe you had no other choice? Getting married two years before death; the two of you don't have much time left. - Idle chatter! - I say what I know for sure! I can read your fortune, too. I don't want to know what's in store for me. Enough for today. I don't like your fortune-telling. - You must be Janosik, eh? - And you're a witch! Don't ply your trade at a wedding. Let me have a drink then. Drink from someone's cup and you'll know their thoughts. A shame for such a lovely body to go to waste. It's almost midnight. Time for the newlyweds to go to bed. Have it your way. - Do I get your meaning? - You do. If I don't want it then I shall have it. You wanted something very much and now you have it. Juro, I want to tell you that you'll make a fine captain. And you'll make a fine husband. This'll be your first booty and my last. Quickly! Quickly! You're not even worth spitting at! You're as manageable as a cat in heat! - You're my wife! - Stop yelling! I've got every reason to be yelling. I could kill you and get away with it! We're in luck. He's got a head on him like a barrel of sour ale. - Should I strangle you? - Hush, I beg you, hush. - Good day, master Szyposz. - Good day. Careful, it's loaded! You again? See? Now here's a man I've not been abIe to teach any manners. Yes, master Szyposz, here I am again. Let's do this once more, shall we? Good day. Well? And mind your manners. Good day... sir. Give it back! We'll take that ham from the pantry if you don't mind, fair lady. Just don't call for help, or I'd have to stop being polite. All the best in your marriage, and much prosperity. This is the time and place. Take the oath! I shall always remain faithful to my company of brigands and neither sword nor sweetness, nor fire or gold or blood will make me betray them. I swear for the first time. I swear for the second time. I swear for the third time. I swear for the fourth time. I swear for the fifth time. I swear for the sixth time. I swear for the seventh time. I swear for the eighth time. For the ninth time do I swear! Another brigand is made!!! Juro, you know why you're such a strong fellow? Why's that? Because your mother ate soil when she was carrying you in her bosom. She had a pot full of soil and ate it when the craving took her. You're the one who craved it. You wanted to be made of clay. You chose your own destiny. Are you mad? You could have killed us! We couldn't help it: it fell! What if it had fallen on the horse!? God rest you, gentlemen!! And don't forget whom you ran into today. Janosik and his men. You're such a looker! What's this talk about Janosik? What was that all about? You've got it good. Loot, make merry, and go back home. Who'll know you've been a-robbing? No one! Me, I can't go home. They know about me. Chew that grass all you want, but brigands lead a dog's life. And that's what's in store for you as well. Everyone has the life he deserves, Huncaga. Remember that. Enough! Come, lads! Can you do it now? - I can. - Go on then! Lads, stop fighting! Why do those two keep fighting? Satora was a prison guard. Gabor was a prisoner. They were transporting prisoners once and something happened. Someone got killed. After that Satora and Gabor ran away. - So why do they stick together? - Shared guilt. It's stronger than love and hate. Guilt is the best glue in the world. Proudly stand the maples Down Szumawa way Now I've let my pants down Come and make my day! Huncaga! Huncaga! Don't get so puffed up, lest you burst! And may the Lord beat sense into those what take offence! Anything coming our way!? Groats and fish and beef and swine need to be washed down with wine! How sweet it smells. Drink it if you want. She brought it for you. You didn't miss much. It was sour. A shame for such a lovely body to go to waste. Not to mention your soul! It breaks my heart to think of it. I'm sorry to be causing you heartache. I truly am. Zuza, can you tell me how I got here? An uncharmed lad is like peas without pork drippings! I had to help you get into the spirit! All right, I'll tell you! Buy sugar without haggling, place it under your shirt, dance with it seven times and pour it into the wine of the person you want to fall in love with you. Works without fail! But the wine was sour! That's because I added something else. God! That's the way I am. Anybody who catches my fancy gets caught in my clutches! It's from Katka. I can't stand it here anymore. - When are you meeting the boys? - In March. On Josephmas. - That's soon enough. - It's a long wait! Tomas, why did you burden me with your company and that damn Huncaga? Because you're the only one who can handle him. What news do you have? We're going to have a child. - Katka is pregnant. - Great! Listen, wouldn't you say she's got prettier? I wish it were spring already. Come here, you old ram! We're back together after the winter. I'm glad all of us made it. You've met Piwowarczyk, you know what sort of man he is. What do we need another herdsman for? He'll be in our company. I have reinforcements too. This is Plawczyk from Dunajov. He'll make a good brigand. What can he do? I understand the language of animals. We could use a man like that. Fine, there'll be two more of us. I've ordered two kegs of beer at Gwizdak's inn. But before that I have a surprise for you. Halt! Halt! Halt! What is your name, you wretch? Juro Janosik, if you want to know! Janosik... You are the voivod! Yes Juro, I am he. This is a friend. He's one of ours. A friend of Rakoczi. There aren't many of us left. We're dying out. Wait! I should have died there on that field. At least I would have died in battle. As it is, I'm alive but it's as if I were dead. Rakoczi is hiding, in exile. The struggle seems lost. The Emperor's troops are more arrogant than before. I no longer believe in either freedom or justice. The absurdity of life has caught up with me: Rakoczi's commanders have become corpses and his soldiers have become robbers! Well? Rob me Janosik, or just kill me! Take the life you saved back then! Return everything you took from them. Why? I have spoken. Help them in! Take the forest road, not the valley. The bridge has collapsed. Thank you. One more thing. You mustn't believe the captain. The struggle for freedom and justice never ends. Good luck. Have you lost your mind, captain? They had thirty gold buttons each, and full purses to boot. I won't be bare ass poor on some whim of yours! I won't be pushed around! Why did we let them go? You're as dumb as a wooden trumpet! What was that? I won't let this pass! I'm no simpleton! Away with you! I won't say it again. Huncaga! Janosik's the captain, not you! Captain, my arse! Some captain! We should have robbed something by now. What else will you come up with? Why did we let them go? You're too greedy, Huncaga. If folks could eat gold, you'd choke on it. But the more you chase after it, - Is that so? - the less you'll have. Well then Captain, for your information I intend to catch up with them and take everything they have. Watch your words, Huncaga! Or find yourself another company. If there's any that'll want you. Janosik, we're robbers, we want to rob people! Fine. I'll think it over! No cause for alarm! We're only after your money. Juro! I'm up for a duel if you have a sword to spare. If you defeat me, you can keep your riches and do anything you please with me. But if I win, it'll be the other way around! I learned this from the Emperor's troops! I picked up this little trick with Rakoczi! What a shame! I have to cut your hand off! Folks at the fair said you can get so fired up, you can leave a handprint in stone! - And you believe what they say? - I don't know! But... round by Beautiful there's a rock in which someone pressed a hand. See if it burns then! It won't burn you! We met before. No... - What do they call you? - Barbara. I'm Juro Janosik. Indeed. Indeed what? I know who you are. Here! Take this, it'll come in handy! I've given out a lot of these today. Thank you! Wait! We couldn't make it earlier. Too much snow! - How old is she? - Four months. Four months. Children have to baptised right after they're born. - What do you want to call her? - Barbara. That's a fine name. But Barbaras are ornery. You know what... Heaven on earth! It's raining gold! If not from heaven then from the lords. If it ain't from the lords it's from the brigands. All those with legs on you come running, or you'll regret it as long as you live! The lord's men are riding into the village! The lord's men, on horseback! The lord's men are coming! The lord's men! Janosik! Come home! Come home! Come home! - Biernat! You need help? - No! Run! We won't get far this way. We need horses! Juro... that innkeeper's daughter from Beautiful, Zuzanna Gwizdak... is she your girl? No! Can she be mine then? She can, if that's what she wants! Careful! Close your eyes! I'm not a highwayman. I just go out on the highway with my father sometimes. All of this is stolen but I can make an honest living. I won't go robbing again! I'll come courting you this autumn. Midsummer's Night, 1712 Juro! Juro! Juro! Touch him, touch him, Janosik! So he grows up lucky and healthy! Touch me too Janosik! Spit on her. That'll cure her! Touch me! I want to feel your hand! I'll do anything you want! - You'll do anything? - Anything! Touch him Janosik, touch him for luck. Biernat!? Juro! Juro! Juro!! He's as frail as a poppy flower. What do you expect with the life he's leading. Go to sleep! You know what people are saying about you?! That you've been charmed by veelas, that you can set rocks on fire, that you know how to cast and lift spells, and that you carry magic plants in your belt to give you power. Why are you laughing? It's no laughing matter. - It'll end in tears! - He got that belt from me. I gave it to him when my gut grew too big. Now I know why I've grown so weak in my old age. You know what else they say? That you have giant's blood in you! That's not my fault. I don't go around spreading rumours. - Tell them it's not true. - Who'd believe us? We can't be your parents if you're of giants born! - Juro! - Yes? I'd like a pipe. You hear me, brigand? This is horse manure. It stinks but it's fresh. Its juice will help you, as long as you trust me. Do you trust me? Do you? I do, I do! Drink it! Drink up! Zuzanna Gwizdak, is it? The innkeeper's daughter. Yes, father. She's the one. But she's... known men. Many men. Zuzanna?! - Where's Zuzanna? - In Zilina. She was making too much trouble here! In Zilina? In Zilina. Got married to the butcher. We need to cut them off in the gorge. There's no better place. What do you want to tangle with them for? They'll tear us to pieces! I lost my pistol. I need a new one. Piwowarczyk needs one too. When I was with Rakoczi, an old soldier said what the Turks did to them. They had this ruse ... Come on! Come on! Huncaga! Halt!!! Master Ugronowicz? How goes it? It's you? Still chewing grass? I switched over to meat when I became a brigand! God grant I'll see you hanged yet, Janosik! That doesn't sound too convincing given your present circumstances. God grant I'll see you trussed up, robbed and trouser less! - Now let's see whom God favours! - Thank you sir! Nothing like a father's love! The brigands are coming! It's Janosik! Janka! Where are you? Pour some wine, on the double! Is Janosik here? I am. They caught my son. - When? - A week ago. I didn't know. I thought he was with you. They tried and tortured him in Zilina. He's to be broken on the wheel at dawn. Gabor! Satora! Let's go! So when we caught that Pole, and he was begging for his life, the sergeant said it's too late for mercy... They're laughing, the swine! Quiet!! Move it! Did you hear anything, gentlemen? Nothing, your honour. The dogs in the village must be awake. They can smell the carrion by the scaffold already. He's alive! We'll get you out of this, just don't scream. You can't scream. Hush... hush... Hush... Hush... He's not in pain anymore. Juro?! They've killed Mikolaj! Woe, what have you done? Killed a youth! Woe, he's stretched out on the bier, his dinner's on the stove. Woe, whom did he offend? He never deserved to die! Woe, someone was paid in coin for his head, May he not live to see the year out! Janosik, I'd like to join your company and be a highwayman. - What do they cal you? - Ondrasz Kos. Listen, Ondrasz, you're young yet. It would be a shame if you were to die. Go home and find yourself a lass. I don't care for love, and I'm not afraid to die. All right, Ondrasz. Come back in a year or two, you can join us then. In a year? And if I'm dead by then, you'll see just how miserable a trade it is. Why is the child wailing so? Damned if I know! It's been doing nothing but wail since it was born. Maybe it's because it's not been baptised? Don't talk nonsense. I'm not baptised either and you don't see me crying about it. I won't stuff no priest's purse for pouring some water on the child. All right, brigand, I'll baptise your child. You and your wife can bring it here tomorrow after Mass. But...she's not ... I take it you're not married. It's not uncommon in these parts. But Margeta's against it. She won't come here. What's that? Margeta? The child is hers? Margeta consorts with evil forces, and that hovel of hers is the fiend's den. The place reeks of brimstone from afar. No, that's not true! Margeta's not evil. She's just... woeful... You! You're the one who's woeful if you think the child is yours. That child was begot by Satan. And I'm not christening the devil's spawn! He's my son! - He cries all the time. - No. We've been waiting for you, master Skalka! Me? Why me? Take it, gentlemen. - Gentlemen! Take everything! - We know your kind, you murderer! That's all I have, gentlemen! We'll rob you of all your possessions until there's nothing left! But you've already been robbed of what matters most: your conscience! - A heart! - Honour! Gentlemen, I don't understand. You're making a mistake. You're the mistake! A mistake in a judge's chair. How can you sleep at night, when you've condemned a young man to death that same day? - On the breaking wheel! - Gentlemen, I act in the name of justice! Justice?! Do you feel just now? Or is it only humiliation and pain that you feel? And we're not even torturing you, we're not tearing out your fingernails, not breaking your bones. That would be justice. - Go now! - It wasn't me, it wasn't me, gentlemen. Take that! And that! That's for Mikolaj! Kill him! That's enough! Enough now! May your fat arse burn in hell. Shuffle, huffle, Blacksmith comes a-running, Chased by the devil Chased by a maiden, The devil's tall she'll grasp Rip it off his ass ... Pour this over your body, then sneak it into his drink. He'll be yours or die! He's not breathing! Margeta, he's not breathing! Margeta, he's not breathing! Why doesn't he have a pecker? Margeta?! What happened to his pecker? What have you done? Stop whining! You got me with child? You did! I could have got rid of it, but I didn't. So I gave birth to it. It wasn't meant to live, so it died. Why doesn't he have a pecker? What have you done? Shut up! It's dead! Do you understand? Do you? It was stiff. I needed the pecker of an unchristened baby. Why should I go looking for one when it was right here? Bitch! You bitch! Slicing up your own babe! It would have lived if you'd let it be baptised! Get out! Get out! Why didn't you baptise it yourself, you cur? The child is dead! They'll be hauling some baroness' dowry down the Grochow road tomorrow. My uncle told me. He'll be there? No, but he wants a cut. Fine. He'll get it. Is Huncaga coming with us? So am I! Fine. I don't trust him. Or Huncaga. It's good that you're not as trusting as you used to be. Leave that alone! What do you want? Satora! - Gabor!!! - Stop it! They wouldn't be coming with us if it was a trap. You don't know what's right anymore either. You've been moping around with us ever since Mikolaj's funeral. You didn't want to be a brigand, and now you're flirting with disaster. Fine. If that's the way it's meant to be, we'll get a sign. God, if you still love us, if you haven't condemned us yet, give us a sign whether we should go! See? We'll be careful! Why did you take your bagpipes? Because after this is over, I'm going home. You complained I was moping about yesterday. So I'm leaving! Strange. They're riding too slow. God bless us! - Juro! I'm over here! - Biernat! - Juro... - What are you doing here? I felt sick and had to stay behind. You don't know how happy I am to see you. Where are the others? Huncaga and Plawczyk are gone. The boys figured out that they set them up, and want to take revenge. Kill them, crucify them. They're still looking for them. But tomorrow, at nightfall, you'll find them in our spot. Juro, I feel like a smoke. I have some in that pouch. I'm going to get my grandmother tomorrow morning. She'll set you right. Fine. I'm glad you're here. I never told you I ran away from the army, from Rakoczi. Even though I enlisted of my own free will. I ran away from death. No matter what army you serve in, death and killing's still your trade. It's kill or be killed! And I wanted to live. But brigands don't have to kill. They may be outlaws, but they don't have to kill. Biernat! Biernat!!! Huncaga! Judas! We barely escaped. Did you know that? How much did they pay for us? Thirty pieces of silver? Why did you kill the priest in Domanisa? I know it was you! He deserved to die. So do you. You betrayed and robbed though you didn't have to. You killed a man, though you weren't attacked. You deserve to die. But I won't kill you. I have no right to do so. Death will come and get you. I hope it comes with a vengeance! Begone with you. Get out and never come back! Go! Go!! Juro, why didn't you kill him? Once a traitor, always a traitor. What about you? You had him in your sights. You could have shot him when he was running away. I never killed a man, but you did, in the war! My father says, a man's not a man until he's killed a man! That's what he says? Isn't it so? I don't know. Enough! I didn't mean to, Juro! You saw it! Halt! Some things happen even when we don't want them to. Life springs all sorts of surprises. You're unhappy, that's why you're acting crazy. It happens to everyone sooner or later! When it got to me, I found me a wife and gave it up. You'll know what to do when your time comes. Juro! Kill yourself. I don't know if I'm allowed to. You're not, but I'll absolve you. Will it be easier when I'm dead? Your soul will be at peace, and your body weightless as the wind. - Who are you? - Jesus Christ. No you're not. Neither are you. Why did you pull me out? You wanted to drown yourself! Drown? I'm Juro Janosik. Any child will tell you I have a magic thread in my belt. I can't come to any harm unless it's cut. It's not wise to believe in such things. You're Barbara? Yes. You're pretty. Why aren't you married yet? Because I'm the priest's daughter. Everyone knows that. Besides, I'm tall. Who'd want a wife taller than he is? No one! And the menfolk here are all short. If you keep putting your head underwater and asking too many questions, your magic thread might just snap. So watch yourself! It'd dry faster over a stove! But this way it'll smell fresh. You always have to be right, don't you? The truth is bitter, but good for you. Shoo! Shoo! Juro! What are you doing here? You want to get caught? The lord's men come here almost every day now. Run, keep watch! They're looking for you, Juro. The more stories people tell about you, - the harder the lord's men search. - I'm careful. They say you became invisible and walked through the wall. Leave this land. Go away from here. I'd rather not see you again than see you dead. Don't worry about me. I'll be fine as long as I stay at home. You said so yourself! That's the funeral shirt I got you. What for? So they don't bury you naked. Mother, I'm alive! Why are you telling me this? I'm telling you, so you know what you want. I'm getting married. I didn't know it was this powerful, when you love someone. I always knew we'd meet. You belong to no one and neither do I. I'm odd, you're also different than the rest. How could we not have met? Barbara, heIp me! I will, but how? Marry me. I'd love to! Greetings! The father! Come in. Katka's not feeling well. How are you? I want to get another name, another trade, another life. Just like you did. Hush. So who's your betrothed? Barbara! Barbara!? The priest's daughter. That makes sense. You'll get a birth certificate from the vicarage. And do what I did. You know how to read. Halt! Go on! Come on! Come on! Seize him! All together! That's Marcin Mrowiec! Leave him alone! Let her go! Leave him alone! Let her go, you swine! No! No! Get them! Go on! Shackle them! Did I ever tell you how I became a brigand? No, you never did. I was a young man. I was leading horses out to pasture, when two brigands came riding up. Toporzysko and Drozd. They got me dead drunk. I had to swear nine times I wouldn't betray them. I couldn't remember a thing when I sobered up. They said I took an oath and have to go a-briganding with them. So I took the horses I was minding and went with them. See, I don't even know if I'm a proper brigand. Drozd is still alive somewhere in Poland! And they flayed Toporzysko alive from the neck down, and then, then they impaled him. Yes! Yes! Greetings, Neighbour. Have you heard the news? They've caught some brigands. God grant Janosik's among them. Fassio benevolente. Voluntary confession. Janosik will tell us when he became a brigand, and who talked him into it. I was recruited by Tomas Uhorcik, who was killed in Kremnicke vrchy. Janosik will tell us about his ties and contacts with traitors and enemies of the crown, to wit: Rakoczi and his henchmen, and those who are now in exile. I don't understand the question. I can't answer that. Janosik will tell us whether he has dealings with the Devil. Did he not nail a host stolen from a church to a tree and shoot it so that blood flowed out, and did he not perform this heinous deed in order to give his weapon magic powers? I don't know anything about that. We never stole from churches. Janosik will confess how he robbed the upstanding burgher Jan Szyposz, who is present in this room. We robbed him twice. We took bales of cloth, two rings and four ducats. He will tell us how he robbed the estimable Jan Skalka, who is present in this room, and how he disposed of his property. We robbed master Skalka and gave his gold away. Janosik will tell us whether he killed the priest - from Domanisa and why he did so. - I never killed anyone. He will tell us where his hiding places are and where he concealed the goods he stole. I have no hiding places. Janosik will tell us the names of his associates and those who joined him. Tomas Uhorcik, he died in Kremnicke vrchy, Biernat, Gabor and Satora, they're dead too, three Poles, whose names I don't know, - and one from Moravia. - Is that all? Janosik will tell us whether he knows Piwowarczyk, Jakub Szustek, Plawczyk and Turiak alias Huncaga and whether they are in collusion with him. Piwowarczyk and I were herdsmen together, I know Jakub Szustek as well. They are not brigands. Plawczyk and Huncaga are not in my company. Forgive me, forgive me... I knew Janosik well, I did, and I always said: Women will be the death of you, Janosik! Janosik found himself a girl, name of Anusia. She was an innkeeper. She's the one who betrayed him. And they took his magic belt and the magic weed that made him invisible. He won't get away from them that easy now. Yes indeed. There's no saving Janosik now. You won't endure this, brigand, for many a time have you trespassed against divine law. Therefore I say unto thee: confess! Confession under duress. Fassio torturalis. Do you confess, Janosik? You do not confess! He does not confess. Carry on. Janosik, give us the names of your associates and helpers. Tell us where you have your hiding places. Admit to having killed the priest, to having dealings with the Devil and all the traitors against the Emperor! Go on! Well? I will talk. I have a hiding place in a fir in the Emperor's woods. In the middle of the ridge on the right-hand side, heading for Klenovec. Opposite that fir is a beech with a hand carved in its bark. Is that all you confess to? I have told you everything. Last a little while longer. Not long to go now. No need to be afraid. No need to be afraid. Whereas the accused Juro Janosik, trespassing against the laws of God and men, had two years strayed onto the path of crime and became chief of a gang of brigands, assaulting and plundering many honest folk, and his accomplice godlessly murdered the priest from Domanioea in the presence of the former, so has Janosik been found guilty of other misdeeds, and for these crimes and felonies he shall be pierced with a hook through his left side and hanged so as to deter other evildoers. Midsummer's Night, 1 7 1 3 Hey Lord, bring me John in this hay fresh mown, Bring a brand-new Johnny, For me to call my own. Eyes look all around, See where has it gone, Hey, where has it gone, That old love of yours. - Cry my eyes out I would, - It's a boy! if it did any good! Him whom well I loved, Hey, him whom well I loved, Give back to me, God! JURO JANOSIK WAS HUNG ON A HOOK THROUGH HIS SIDE ON MARCH 1 7, 1 7 1 3 TOMAS UHORCIK WAS BROKEN ON THE WHEEL ON APRIL 21, 1713
