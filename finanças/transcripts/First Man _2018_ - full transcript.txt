20 seconds 10 seconds We are on the path Set to 140000 feet when going down Approaching 150000 feet You should regain aerodynamic control We see you floating, not spinning Height increases Neil, you will come out of the atmosphere Height is still increasing, Neil Check the wheel You will go down I've gone down Good Are you okay? Yes Okay, Neil He's a good engineer. But he was distracted He has a house He went out of the atmosphere scared of how he came home Don't have an accident this month Have him think before flying Already. It's okay, honey. Come on What is that? Isn't this great? What's fun? -Yes, Maybe I should talk to Dr. John about this Who? - Dr. Herald John He developed a procedure about this So you will go again? I think I'll take a break for a while Why don't you talk to the hospital? See if the tumor might be I've talked to them I'm sorry, Neil. I hope we can offer more than this It's okay, Jack... I appreciate it Sure - Send my greetings to your family? Good - All right... Dahh. You're very helpful - I'll take it Thank you He called you from Houston. He asked about you. Where is he? German? He is looking for someone who has an engineer background Maybe after Karen started to improve I couldn't until then It would be nice for you to stay there Enjoy -Thank you -Same together Joe - Hey, Janet. How are you doing? You know how to Glad you stopped by -Of course See you later Father, want to play? Father must help your mother It's time for me to go back to work OK He won't go through it. I won't spend my time. Good morning Neil 0 You can leave a few days 1 0 I know 1 0 I just want to catch up 1 0 He canceled his trip 1 0 He wants you to focus on improving the 1 section 0... from your last flight 1 0 Am I being punished, Joe? 1 0 Write the report, okay? 1 0 NASA Selects Astronauts for the Gemini Project1 0 Are you coming? -Yes -Yes, me too 1 0 Elliot -Neil1 0 Spend time all morning, huh? 1 0 We're not there in a long time 1 0 Of course, I think NASA is more interested in psychological reactions1 0 I think you're pretty good 1 0 Armstrong 1 0 Good luck -You too1 0 Not him anymore 1 0 Previously you were a candidate for a program 1 0 As you know, our decision to1 0 the approach to the moon has a big impact on Gemini1 0 Do you have thoughts about this decision? 1 0 Consider criticism, 1 0 go by parking the main plane in orbit,1 0 sends smaller ships down to the moon's surface1 0 is a separate challenge 1 0 What do you see as a challenge? 1 0 One of them is the lunar navigation, running and docking1 0 Why do you think space flight is important? 1 0 There are several opportunities to observe the atmosphere1 0 That's very small. It's only a small part of the earth.1 0 You can barely see everything 1 0 When you're down here, and look up 1 0 that looks pretty big and you don't think much about it1 0 But when you get another strategic place, 1 0 that will change your perspective 1 0 I don't know what space exploration revealed,1 0 but I don't feel browsing is only for browsing purposes1 0 I think that's more about the fact that it allows us1 0 see things that we might have seen a long time ago1 0 But we can only do it now1 0 Anything else? -Yes Neil, I'm sorry for your daughter 1 0 Sorry. What is a question? 0 I mean, do you think it will have an impact?1 0 I don't think it would be reasonable to assume1 0 there won't be some impact 1 0 Alright, Neil that's all 1 0 Thank you for your time 1 0 Hello? 1 0 Yes, of course this is 1 0 Hello? - May I leave? 0 Yes, sir 1 0 Thank you, sir 1 0 I succeeded 1 0 This is a new start 1 0 Are you sure? -Yes, 1 0 This will be an adventure 1 0 Since long ago, humans have always tried to go to the moon1 0 lde how to go to the moon is1 0 sends a starship there and returns1 0 But NASA engineers developed a modern approach1 0 where one rocket can contain several ships1 0 who will travel together 1 0 Just like Columbus brought Santa Maria1 0 to the coast of the New World, astronauts will bring1 0 smaller ships to follow the carrier1 0 drops to the surface of the moon 1 0 When it's time to return, smaller ships1 0 will be lifted from the surface, and anchored to the aircraft carrier,1 0 which will bring the crew back to earth1 0 Thank you for NASA's intelligent thinking,1 0 the old dream to go to the moon will be reached soon1 0 Sputnik, Sputnik ll, Vostok 1 0 Soviets try hard to win in every great achievement of space1 0 Our program can compete 1 0 So we chose to focus on very difficult work1 0 which requires so much technological development1 0 which makes Russia have to start from the beginning1 0 So do we 1 0 Hi, I'm Pat I've been here a week earlier than you1 0 Welcome here - You're very kind1 0 I'm Janet. Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. 0 So instead of being here, we will go 1 0 here That's the scale 1 0 That's my husband, Ed. And that's Ed Jr. 1 0 I don't know where Bonnie - You have 2 children?1 0 Yes this is your first child? 1 0 No We have a son, Eric - How old is he?1 0 5.5 years -We have to meet them1 0 If we want this to be done, we need to prove it 1 0 2 ships can find each other in orbit1 0 and enter the dock without a collision 1 0 That's the Gemini project's main mission 1 0 After we think you are ready, each of you1 0 will be assigned to fly with a specific task1 0 Only after we master this whole task,1 0 we fly Apollo 1 0 Think of this as a trial landing on the Moon 1 0 Nice to meet you - Nice to meet you too, Pat1 0 Dah - Eddie! Put it down! 0 Is there something you want to add? 1 0 Just do your job 1 0 The scale is almost right 1 0 Multi-axis trainer is designed to replicate movement in 3 shafts1 0 Something you might find in space1 0 The challenge is to stay stable in your seat before fainting1 0 First victim, Armstrong 1 0 Are you awake? - I can 1 0 I'm fine 1 0 Let's do it again 1 0 Damn 1 0 Gentlemen, welcome to rocket base physics1 0 We only discussed chapter 1 tonight 1 0 When using more than one launch ship,1 0 needs to determine the exact size and stage1 0 Hi 1 0 Are you okay? -Yes, 1 0 I only think about college. A little great. 0 What's great? 1 0 This is about if you throw us, 1 0 it will slow you down because it puts you1 0 in higher orbit so you have to reduce the push1 0 and put you in a lower orbit 1 0 to catch us 1 0 But that's not what pilots teach1 0 If you think about it, that's right 1 0 That's kind of great 1 0 Yes -What is so funny? - Not. Not funny 1 0 It's just rather great 1 0 Do you remember this? -Yes. I'm surprised you remember. 0 Thank you / -Thank you for inviting us 1 0 I'm happy 1 0 That's a beautiful piano, Pat. You play the piano? 1 0 I just bought it 1 0 Maybe he will sing for us after eating1 0 He plays the piano? 1 0 He can play everything -Janet1 0 Come on -He is a music director while in college1 0 Dear -He plays music1 0 I don't play music - Yes, you play1 0 No We only use music to kill birds1 0 He wrote new lyrics 1 0 That's kind of funny 1 0 What land? 1 0 Have you never heard of it? - Not yet 1 0 That's surprising it's a remote island 1 0 But it's a magical place 1 0 That's the lecture They are retarded 1 0 Seriously? -Yes, 1 0 Are you a backup? -Yes, 1 0 Don't worry You will get your own mission1 0 How is the practice? -Good we are near 1 0 The first human to walk in space1 0 That would be great, huh? - / Yes 1 0 Walking is the easy part 1 0 Returning to that is difficult - Yes1 0 It will be very difficult to return 1 0 I think we need to pray so that it happens1 0 Shut up, Armstrong 1 0 Ed! -Yes? -There's a call for you 1 0 From who? -Deke 1 0 OK. 1 0 I tested you, and you passed 1 0 I'm thinking about flying - Yes?1 0 No. I turn it on right now 1 0 Hey, everybody! 1 0 New Soviet aircraft designed for the lunar surface1 0 I'll call you back 1 0 This is of course humanity's first EVA 1 0 In any space program, 1 0 EVA is considered to be one of the most important tests 1 0 which astronauts must control if they want to succeed to the moon1 0 Astronaut Ed White is scheduled to do the first EVA with Gemini 41 0 So this is another big victory for the Soviet Union 1 0 in space racing 1 0 We can from here 1 0 Thank you, Elliot 1 0 Look up there Don't get wrong1 0 We will kill each other 1 0 Please stay around here 1 0 Neil! 1 0 Neil Armstrong, our backup commander 1 0 Hello -Hello1 0 They will help launch 1 0 Can you talk for a while? 1 0 gentlemen 1 0 We appointed you to lead Gemini 8 1 0 David Scott will be your pilot 1 0 We turn Agena on again 1 0 Maybe you will be the first person to dock1 0 Don't worry about Elliot We will make his brain work1 0 We have big plans for Gemini 8 There's a lot to do1 0 Yes, sir. We'll talk later.1 0 Good luck, Daddy! 1 0 Kapana did you meet him? 1 0 I don't remember exactly. At that time high school. -SMA? 0 Yes We have a summer house 1 0 Go to the lake, fishing 1 0 I go swimming 1 0 Cannot be compared 1 0 You caught me 1 0 That's the longest small river in the world, 1 0 But... - The second longest is the longest one 1 0 Hi, Ed-Hi I want to talk to Neil1 0 Yes, sure. Why aren't you coming in? 0 No... I'll wait here. Thank you 1 0 Good - it will hurt1 0 What? -It will hurt 1 0 Yes. -All right, this is the sky piece. 0 Neil, there's Ed outside -Okay1 0 Do you want to enter? - I have bad news about Elliot. 0 Yes, I know, he told me 1 0 No. His plane and Charlie crashed and died on the spot 1 0 They don't feel pain 1 0 So dad really flew over the bridge?1 0 What's fun? You're not afraid? 0 Ricky, baby. Why don't you check your sister? 0 Yes, ma'am 1 0 Who? 1 0 How did that happen? 1 0 They told me they were both found1 0 150 meters from the plane South of the building1 0 Obviously he was wrong when approaching him too close to the runway1 0 What? 1 0 You know Deke doubts him that's why he was moved1 0 Deke appoints Elliot to the leader 1 0 Elliot isn't aggressive on the pitch. You all should know that1 0 I know 1 0 I didn't investigate the collision 1 0 I didn't study the flight path 1 0 And I don't fly the plane 1 0 So I won't pretend I know something1 0 Anything that is 100% sure 1 0 We can go? 1 0 Not now Elliot would want me to help Marilyn1 0 Everything to do after he is gone1 0 Neil? 1 0 I'm sorry... I hate troubling you 1 0 Janet, this isn't troublesome - Right1 0 Neil 1 0 There is a year at that 1 0 4 dead pilots 1 0 We lost a good friend that year 1 0 We haven't seen anyone in some time1 0 Has he ever told Karen about you, Ed?1 0 Not really 1 0 Have you ever talked about it? 1 0 No 1 0 Never 1 0 Hey, man 1 0 You should be with Janet 1 0 You should play with your children, put them to sleep1 0 You think I left him, and are here,1 0 in the backyard because I want to talk to someone?1 0 Sorry? 1 0 You think I'm leaving him because I want to talk to someone?1 0 1 minute before the Agena launch 1 0 Agena has been launched 1 0 Everything looks good 1 0 Stand by for the Gemini launch 1 0 What is that? 1 0 Does anyone have a Swiss Army knife? - What did you say? Swiss Army knife? 0 Are you kidding me? -It has been 1 0 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 5, 4, 3, 2, 1... Checked 1 0 Good T-minus 2 minutes 1 0 It's set 1 0 Soon 1 0 T-minus 20 seconds 1 0 10, 9, 8 1 0 7, 6, 5 1 0 4, 3, 2, 1 1 0 Burn 1 0 Up 1 0 We glide 1 0 It's gone up 1 0 Can it be checked? 1 0 Keep going up 1 0 We stopped 1 0 Gemini 8 control system 1 0 Our graph shows Gemini 8 in orbit1 0 The crew is now trying to find an unmanned ship1 0 and dock there 1 0 Do you have visuals? 1 0 Houston, I think we are a little too far off We should stop early1 0 Good 8, stand by for repairs 1 0 How are we doing? 1 0 We get the path. We will recalculate1 0 8, did you hear that? 1 0 Can you get this? - We need a computer. 0 Don't get sidetracked. Come on, everything is 1 0 Okay, let's send it to them 1 0 This is Houston We need you to burn very slowly,1 0 became stand-by to hear it 1 0 He's level up 1 0 8, do you hear? 1 0 Mark Put it back on the table 1 0 Give it to dear mother, give it is very important1 0 Give it to mom right now, you hear? 1 0 Mark Armstrong, if you don't return it1 0 8, you hear? - Mom isn't kidding, Mark 1 0 I was worried about 1 0 I can't see the possible reasons for that1 0 Are we on schedule? 1 0 I can't. Sorry, I have to see this -Okay1 0 8, can you give us your status? -Not much to do 1 0 Good Stand-by 1 0 Okay We will do a closed loop 1 0 Forward 1 0 We will go there in 1 0 3, 2, 1, burn 1 0 It might be a planet - Maybe1 0 This is Houston We have a backup when you are ready to hear1 0 Stand-by We get visuals from Agena 1 0 Or something that is possible is Agena 1 0 There is a visual possibility of Agena? 1 0 We're a little far away 1 0 I will start maneuvering 1 0 What is our speed? 1 0 How far should it be? 1 0 That's it. -It can't be trusted 1 0 Visual is confirmed 1 0 Can you? 1 0 Houston, we are ready to join Agena1 0 Okay, Gemini 8 You look fine from here1 0 This is the end... 1 0 We have docked 1 0 Yes! 1 0 And tell the Soviets that they are upset1 0 Call Congress too 1 0 Let's go out and buy food 1 0 Gemini 8, this is Houston Please stand-by 1 0 Mom, I don't like this. Get rid of all this paper. Mom knows 1 0 I spent days trying to do it1 0 And now it's broken. Look at my door, you know1 0 I made it with daddy, and now look at 1 0 Every time you tell a story, I'm not sure you're honest1 0 I said the truth. Look at this. - Don't talk to mom like that. 0 Don't sulk 1 0 8, this is Houston. I have an update, please stand-by 1 0 Okay -Rick!1 0 Alright... Come on now! 1 0 Gemini 8, we lose the signal.

It's not 1 0 Turn off the Agena control system 1 0 Contact 4-0-0 Turn off the Agena control system1 0 Turn off Agena. -I'm turning it off 1 0 Cannot 1 0 We have to break away 1 0 We are getting faster 1 0 Separate yourself from Agena 1 0 This is Gemini to the center. There was a problem with Agena. 0 You can use a booster to get out of Agena?1 0 follow my command 1 0 2, 1 1 0 Damn it. No effect 1 0 Not Agena, but we are 1 0 Gemini 8 is back connected in 3, 2, 11 0 This is the center, checking Gemini 8 What is your status?1 0 Gemini 8 What is your status? - We have a problem 1 0 We are circling 1 0 We are separated from Agena 1 0 Okay We have plane records here 1 0 What's the problem? 1 0 We are spinning and can't turn on anything1 0 This is the center -Please1 0 Did he say he can't turn off Agena? 1 0 No. He said it's separate from Agena. 1 0 and he spins around, and can't stop it1 0 Their rotation meter increases 1 0 They will faint for about 40 seconds 1 0 Paul 1 0 Center, this is Gemini 8 1 0 We are slowly stopping 1 0 Good 1 0 We started to stop I tried to balance1 0 We've stopped -Good1 0 What about an emergency landing? 1 0 With 25% remaining fuel? 1 0 What do you think? 1 0 I think we need to act now 1 0 Deke Janet is outside 1 0 Janet, the ship got stuck, but it's okay1 0 He's fine, Janet. -I need you to go home 1 0 Good Turn on the radio again 1 0 I'll see what I can do. -Now it is 1 0 Turn it back on now 1 0 I have a security protocol - I don't care1 0 There are dozens of cameras on my front page, Dek 1 0 Can you tell me what happened? 1 0 Janet, you have to believe in us We have controlled this1 0 No. All these protocols and procedures to make 1 0 you seem to control it 1 0 But you are a group of men who model1 0 from balsa wood. You don't control anything! 0 Rescue 1 will be on the station 1 0 with a vehicle 1 0 You got the location? 1 0 Yes 1 0 I want to argue with them about going home, but1 0 I'm sure it can't 1 0 Yes 1 0 Is there anything else we forget? 1 0 As far as I know, you do everything right1 0 Gemini 8 landed on the same day on time1 0 We glide smoothly, 1 0 Like I said, we initially assumed the anomaly was1 0 is on the Agena control system 1 0 Because it is impossible to know which driver causes it1 0 If we can isolate each driver1 0 and review its current capabilities 1 0 Do you have any anxiety about the failure of the demonstration?1 0 And when you spin, do you feel the presence of God1 0 closer than other times? 1 0 Regarding the deaths of Charlie Bassett and Elliot See1 0 Are you asking whether this program is worth the price?1 0 In money and life? 1 0 Okay, thank you. We have a lot to talk about1 0 We will contact you soon 1 0 Thank you 1 0 That's right 1 0 "Our Wild Journey in Space"? 1 0 Last time I knew 1 0 Almost mom will finish wrapping your brother's gift1 0 Mom will come back You finish that one1 0 I'll try 1 0 Continue 1 0 If this is entertaining, a few weeks after Gemini 4 is difficult1 0 Yes? 1 0 I think it must be confusing for them / Right1 0 I married Neil because I want a normal life1 0 I know 1 0 This is very different from other men on campus1 0 This is like a war 1 0 What did you want to do first? 1 0 You look very stable 1 0 I guess what I want is only stability 1 0 I have a sister who has a normal life1 0 Yes? -He married a dentist 1 0 Dentist?

Don't get carried away 1 0 Get out of my house 1 0 I'm not kidding Get out of my house 1 0 Neil 1 0 Hi, Neil No need to sit This will be a short meeting1 0 We've talked about it, and it's pretty clear1 0 if you don't do that, you won't be here1 0 and we won't be able to ask you what happened1 0 You did the right thing. - This mission succeeded 1 0 You will tell everything to Paul... Can you?1 0 Yes, sir 1 0 I believe you have no problem representing me in the White House?1 0 No, sir -Good1 0 Thank you -Thank you1 0 No! 1 0 If you ask me, he deserves to be punished1 0 I'll put it in the fridge -Yes?1 0 Okay Enter. -Not - Put him there longer. 0 I got one 1 0 Who did it? - What? - He ruined the room. 0 Stand there 1 0 She's funny 1 0 Thank you very much! - Stop laughing 1 0 You're lying! -Stop it. You're the cause of upset mother 1 0 Mother doesn't laugh. - I don't laugh. I cry 1 0 Eddie starts asking about the new command model1 0 Really? -This won't be different like flying with Gemini 1 0 We will end up in the same place 1 0 Geez You will have a small engineer 1 0 But I tell you, I like that 1 0 That really means 1 0 And when he runs towards you and says, "Father" 1 0 When you go to the moon, you will be lonely up there1 0 Very far from earth 1 0 Want to go home 1 0 It feels like he's almost expanding his horizons1 0 He gave me confidence 1 0 Does that make sense? 1 0 Walter has a new swing set 1 0 Yes 1 0 We used to have that swing in the old house1 0 Karen will like it 1 0 That's your daughter? 1 0 I think I'll go home 1 0 The door is closed now 1 0 Okay that's all 1 0 Thank you, Ed 1 0 Closed door Closes the protector 1 0 The cable is revoked 1 0 Ready for action 1 0 Can you hold the chat in the microphone? 1 0 Let's start the countdown 1 0 Sorry, we will start everything 1 0 We've been here overnight 1 0 We don't hear that / Of course not1 0 I'm glad you think it's funny 1 0 We have troubled you.

Why 35 years ago flew across the Atlantic? Why is Rice playing for Texas? We choose to go to the moon! We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do something else, not because they are easy, but because they are difficult Mrs. Armstrong! How are you feeling? Have you talked to your husband? Where is your son? Mrs. Armstrong, have all your questions been answered? Yes How do you explain the flight? I can only say it outside this world Thank you.
