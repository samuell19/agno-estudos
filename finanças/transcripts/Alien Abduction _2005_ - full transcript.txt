Todd? Sweetie, is that you? Britney? Bud? Guys, this isn't funny. Oh, my God. Todd? Todd, get the camera! Damn it. Where is it? Damn it. Oh. Hello? Todd? Whoa. Todd, oh my God! It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. Everything's okay, everything's okay, what's going on? What's going on, Baby? I thought you were... I saw something. What? What, what, what'd you see? Oh, Baby, did you see a bear? No, it was something else. It was something in the sky. Oh, like a UFO or something? Screw you. Jean, Baby, you've been watching way too much Discovery Channel. Let go. I taped it. Have you seen the pigs' feet? Gross! What? You roast 'em, they're good. I'm not gonna be kissing you, okay? Oh, yeah? Sicko. Has anyone seen my camera? I left it around here. Oh, I'll find it. What happened to you? Don't ask. She said she saw a UFO. What? Woohoohoo ha! What? Fierce! I've always wanted to see one of those. It's just something up in the sky, I don't know what it was. Bud, I wanna go camping some place else. Do you hear me, Bud? Let's go camping somewhere else, where there's like, buildings, and a toilet, and a 7-Eleven, for goodness sakes. Sounds good to me. Found it. Here it is, the moment of truth. Yes! Stop, it was on my butt. Bring lots of wine back. Stop! Go away. All right. We love you, Baby. Bye. I saw it. Where's the rest of the sound? It's on, it's fine. No, there was this high pitched squeal, I had to cover my ears. It's not on the tape. Well maybe it was just inside your head, from like, high blood pressure or something. It was not inside my head. Hey, there it is. I see it. A space ship.. That's the sun, it's light bouncing off the lens. Look, there. It's just a bird, you idiot. I don't understand, I saw it. I taped it, there was something up there. Well I believe you, Jean. I'm sorry, Baby. These things, they happen all the time. People think that they see these things, and they're convinced, but you know... Yeah, you know, it's kinda like this talk show I saw once, where there was this girl, and she kept talking to her dad, but only problem was he was dead. And so they did all these tests and stuff and they found out she was like schizoid and stuff. It wasn't her fault. Thanks a lot, Brit. You're welcome. Yo Bud, let me see the lighter. Ah, I lost it, Man. Are you serious, Man? Damn, yeah, I lost it. What do you guys need a light for? You guys shouldn't be smoking pot. Talk to your boyfriend, he owes us some fine pot. Get the matches. You got matches? Thank you. Yeah, I'll go get 'em. Losers. That works good, Baby. What the fuck? Probably some big fucking animal, I'll get it. Hey, Bud. Jean, you remember my code? Hey, Baby. Honey, what's my, do you know my code? Hey, Bud. Jean, do you remember my code? Holy shit. Holy shit, Motherfucker. What? There's a big fucking alligator, no, it's a fucking bear. What the fuck! Jean! What? What is that? Get outta there! Guys, get out! Britney, come on. Get out here. Come on, come on. Come on, Britney. All right, come on. Come on, Baby, come on, come on, come on. Please tell me, please tell me that was a bear, right? That was not a bear, that was not a bear. Dude, that was Sasquatch. What? Fucking Sasquatch! Bigfoot, he lives up here, Man. Shit. Are Britney and Bud here? I don't know, I can't see shit. Britney? Shh. They'll hear you. Those fucking things already know we're here. Britney? Brit? Jean... Jeanie. Bud? Jeanie, Jeanie. Jeanie. Jeanie, I wanna go home. Hey, I found Bud. I wanna go home. We're gonna get you home, soon. Gotta get outta here. I found Bud. Buddy! Buddy, Buddy. Are you all right? (Mumbles) How long have I been out? 'Bout 10 minutes. Is Bud okay? Why don't you ask him, yourself? Hi, Jean. We're on a space ship. I was so worried. No worries. I'm good, now. Bud, I told you not to, stop! What the fuck was that? Wow. Guys, what in the world is... What? I'm not going in there. No fucking way! It can't be any worse than sitting in here. Yes it can! I'm not going in there. Guys, it's just like a long corridor, it's... It's really amazing. Jeanie, would you please put that thing down. Come on, let's focus on getting out of here. Honey, I don't think we're going anywhere until they let us out, so... Besides, the recording of this could make us rich, right? Great. I think we're being announced. It's okay, it's okay, I'm here. Are you all right? Come on, Guys, come on. We're coming. Put the fucking thing down. We're so gonna die. We're not gonna die. How do you know? How do you... Behind us! Todd! Todd, no! I think she's waking up, now. You've had quite an experience. Welcome back. Hello, my name is Doctor Booker, I've been assigned to your case. Now just relax while I examine you. Shh, you are in a military hospital, in a highly specialized trauma center. Do you remember what happened to you? What about your name? Do you know that? Your name is Jean. I want a full T-Scan on her right away, let's push this one to the front of the line. I'll talk to the Major. I'll she if she can slip her in. I'm Thomas, by the way. You take care, now, okay? Please take all medications as prescribed. Please take all medications as prescribed. Second shift. Take your meds. Tongues? Try the orange stuff. It tastes like carrots. Remember those? Cranial, 9.02. Torso, 18.36. Pelvic, 19.08. Extremities, 13.67. This one came with a video tape, Sir. What was on it? Everything. Is that going to be a problem? No, Sir. No internal scarring, no abnormalities. She's clean. All right, move her up to Phase Two. Let's try to get her home. Any objections? Not at this point, Sir. Take her to the recovery room. Stay still. This might pinch. Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello! Hello? You seem to be feeling a bit better, today. Is there anything we can do about this? It's driving me crazy. It's meant to calm you down. I'll see what I can do. I think there was a man in my room last night. I don't think that's possible. It must've been a dream. Well, I've had lots of dreams. Do my parents know that I'm here? The uh, appropriate people have been notified, yes. Can I call them? Not yet. I have to ask you some questions first. Do some tests. Where are my friends? They're not here. Now, let's focus on you for the moment. Okay, okay, what happened to me, then? First, I'd like you to hear something. Listen to this, tell me what it is. Any guesses? Some sort of classical? I don't know what it is, though. It's Mozart. Now this. Well? Some sort of machine sound? I don't know. I understand. I prefer jazz, myself. Now, let's begin the test. Take a look at these shapes, tell me what they are. Well, there are lines and there are circles, and there are draws. Does it look like a symbol for anything? No, not really. Do you recognize these. No. Do you speak another language, besides English? A little French. Could this be another language? I don't think so. Pick which ones are not made up. Uh, the one on the left. The flag. A concentration camp. Are you familiar with this? No. Maybe from a dream? I said no. What's this? I don't have a clue. Now will you tell me what's happened to me? You were abducted. Kidnapped? In a way. How? By who? Pretend I don't know. You tell me. I don't remember. Tell me anyway. The last thing you recall. Um... Okay, um... I was camping, with my friends, and uh, and they went to the store and I stayed. And that's the last thing that I remember. And then I woke up here. We run a specific rehabilitation program in this hospital. For people who have been taken. Taken? Just like you were. By whom? By curious beings. Intelligent beings from another world. This facility alone processes hundreds of recovered abductions every year. Hundreds! Everybody knows. They may not trust what they hear, they may not believe it, and that's the way the army likes to keep things. No panic. I need to call my mother and father. No, it's not that.. Please, please, please! Let me call my mom, please let me call my mom. You may have memories that could hurt us one day. Please, please.. Post permission. You need to be cleared. And unfortunately, you did not pass this test. What are you talking about? I just wanna go home! I just wann go home. Of course, of course, that's what I want, too. But our local commander is going to want proof that she can trust you. Now stop crying, and act like you're happy with the results. We're being watched. Remember those pictures. You'll see ones like those again. So keep your mind clear. You'll need it. Phase Three Patients, please report to room 26B. Phase Three Patients, please report to 26B. I don't like her. Give her a chance. She lied today, I saw it. I'm sure she'll be just fine, once she gets out. We can't wait until then. Every Class Four abduction in the North Atlantic region goes through this facility. Any breach, any contamination, and I'm responsible. Just test her tomorrow. She's almost there. I'm telling you to move on. I like this case, I'm close to it. Well, you'd better like it. 'Cause if this does not clean up fast, you're going to answer for it. Please take all medications as prescribed. Third shift. Take your meds. Brit? Brit? Phase One Patients, follow me. Brit? Hey! Brit? Britney? You, back in your area. Thank God, I was so worried. Who the hell are you? No talking. I've got this. What? What? Listen, listen. That's not the person you think it is. What are you talking about? That's my friend, that's Britney. You told me that they weren't here. They aren't. At least not the way they were before. What? What happened to them? You were lucky, your friends weren't. Jean! Watch it. Hey, you're not allowed..

Doctor Booker said you were strong. He was right. Maybe you and I got off on the wrong foot, this afternoon. Maybe I didn't really give you a chance at all. Would you like a chance, now? Are you willing to cooperate? What do you want? No need to be so defensive, I'm here to make amends. Nobody wants to keep you around this facility any longer than we have to, least of all me. So? Now we set you free. Let you go home. Would you like that? That's all I want, is to go home. That's all I want. Of course. Oh, that's right. I was taken, too. A long time ago. We all were. Everybody that works here. Some stay and help, others go back. I stayed. So you see, we have more in common than you think. I wanna go to the storage room. Who let you know about the storage room? Just, just one of the other patients, it was at lunch. Come come, I won't bite. Come, Jean. Doctor Booker, Doctor Latt, please report to Nurse's Station immediately.

What are you doing here? I need, I need to get this tape to Doctor Booker. It's really important. Doctor Booker? Are you a patient? Yeah. Hi! Hi, Guys. Oh, you're doing so... Yes. Perfect. Oh, my boy. Yes. Now, give me a little egg. Hm? Baby. Just give me one little egg, and... Mmhmm. Oh, yes. Beautiful. So beautiful. Just perfect. Thank you. I'm in a secret hospital used by the US military. For people who've been abducted by extra-terrestrials. I am not sure how long I've been here. I just saw live little alien creatures. I taped it. They were in jars. They were small, but they looked pretty dangerous. Let's get this body to the morgue. What the fuck's happening? Hey, get away from her! Hey, we better call the Major. Oh hey, hi, hi. Oh, hey, uh... I am so sorry. Sorry. Um... Um... Should I, should I step out, or.. No, no, I'm almost done, sorry. Oh no, it's no problem, I... You know, if I came in about a minute later, then you would be naked. And... No, no, it's just driving me nuts. Less of my old life to deal with. Can I, can I look yet? Feast your eyes. I look like everybody else. Too bad. Have we met? You look really familiar. Yeah, I've been around. Yeah, yeah, I'm telling you, no way. They got one of those things running around loose on the base, man, I'm not getting myself killed, too. So they assigned somebody else. One of them things is loose? Yeah, Man, what are you, asleep? I don't know why they keep those things so close to us, anyhow, I mean, they give me the creeps. My question is, why do they keep 'em alive at all? Medical Attendants, please report to Recovery. Oh, back to the trenches. Oh, man, give me a break, would you? Are you coming? Uh... All right, well then I'll see you on the next round. Next round. If we don't act now, this is going to get out of control. We can't afford to let this base get contaminated. I'll step up patrol, I'll set up the checkpoints myself. Checkpoints. Something big is about to happen. And now I have to deal with this. Something big. What, an invasion? Off the record? Yes. They don't really think that those things will attack us? No. We're going to attack them. Now clean up this mess. You need something in there? Doctor Booker's Office? Straight ahead, down the hall. Can I help you? Um, I was just looking for Doctor Booker. Do you have an appointment? 'Cause he's not here right now. Do you know when he'll be back? Wait here a second, I have to make a call and check out something, Security! I know who you are, now. Yes. You were a patient here last week. I remember you. How'd you get a job here so quick? Just lucky, I guess. Well you know your way around, yet? Not really. Well then I will show you the ropes. Uh... Walk with me. Where's that door lead to? Oh, that door, that is the Rear Access Hall. That's for special areas like for garbage, loading dock, things like that. Are they like real exits? Oh yeah, yeah, sure. That's where the in and out access is. Can we go there? To a loading dock? No. No, that's only if you have a blue card. Shouldn't everybody know what's going on, here? Look, um, we work for the military now. Okay? Now, if we mess that up, or threaten to talk about this on the outside, they will terminate us without a second thought. I guess they figure that there's plenty more where we came from. Come on, let's go this way. ♪ La, la la la la la la la la ♪ La la la la la ♪ La, la la la la la la la la ♪ La la la la la ♪ La, la la la la la la la la ♪ La la la la la ♪ La, la la la la la la la la Yeah, we get 'em pretty regular in here. Most of 'em don't even know where they are, or who they are. Some of 'em don't even remember being found. There's so many of them. Yeah. It's only been this bad for a few weeks, though. Will anything ever be the same again? No, everythin was better, before. The food tasted better, we had friends. Ah, I shouldn't be talking like this. That was a good memory. One of the best. We need to take this one to Room 16. Oh my God, it's a little girl. They like it if you talk to 'em. Hello. Hello. What's your name? My name's Bonnie, I'm five years old. My name's Jean. Uh, where am I? You're in a hospital, Sweetie. You have to be strong, okay? When we get in there, you just tell 'em everything that they wanna hear, okay? Okay. You must carry a security pass at all times. Okay, hey, they do this every once in awhile, just have your ID card.. Identification. Ready. Okay? Oh... Here you go. I need to see your ID. Okay. Is everything okay, or.. Yeah, yeah, I just, gimme a second. Step over to the side, please. Hey, look, she works with me, okay? She's good. This is Checkpoint Delta, we need security up here right away. I'll vouch for her, okay, she works with me. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Jean! Security Breach. Security Breach. Security Breach. Oh, excuse me, excuse me. Hey, watch it! Sorry, sorry, sorry. You, help get rid of that thing. Ah! Come on, let's get this body to the freezers. Grab it, all right? I keep telling you, there's more than one of 'em out there, and if we don't get outta here, we're gonna be next. I don't wanna hear it, let's just push, all right? Oh, what the hell are they doing? Man, we already got checked once. Well, pull it out one more time for the boss. Identification. Lieutenant, she's with me. Yes, Sir. This way. Get off of me! I just saved your life. You, you left me. You left me to get my head drilled open. I know, I know, I'm sorry. I was trying to stop it, but... You're quite a resourceful young lady. We've tried this with others, but they never made it that far. You, on the other hand... Do you have the original tape? Here. Everything's on this, show it to everyone, just get me the hell out of here. I wish it were that simple. What are you doing? I needed that! What you need, is to show this video to the world. Do you understand? Eat this. Are you crazy? Eat this, it's the only way. I'm not eating a memory stick. Look, Jean, I don't have much time. If you ever get outta here they won't let you bring this memory stick with you. But if it's hidden inside of you, please, put it in your mouth. If you believe in something strong enough, sometimes you gotta make sacrifices. Oh, there you are, Doctor. We've been looking everywhere for you. Ah, well, you've found me. What is this all about? Lieutenant, why don't we escort Doctor Booker to the interrogation room? I need to ask him a few questions. After you. Major wants us to check every room. Are we looking for the runway girl? Or more bodies? Both. All right, we need to check every door, look in the Science Lab up here, we'll continue with the North Wing. Excuse me, has anyone else been in here? Oh, no Sir. Sorry to bother you, there's a patient on the loose. She's already killed three. Oh, thank you for warning me. It's almost time. It's almost, almost time. Now we need to fertilize you. It's time! Now uh, I need some sperm. And I don't want you to make a fuss. Or you're going to be in big, big trouble. Just... Ah! That's it, yes. You better be quiet! You be quiet, or you'll wake the others. You be quiet. You stupid breeder! Quiet! Quiet! Quiet, quiet, quiet! Quiet! Hi. I know who you are! I am Class Four, and you are coming with me. No, no, no! Oh, yes you are. Can I help you? Oh! Yeah, go, go. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Where did you go? And what is that smell? Why don't you just leave me alone? I'm only gonna cause you trouble. 'Cause I know who you are. And I wanna help you. All right. Then help me get my friends. What friends? They're in there. Three patients. We can't take anybody out. Wait! Open it. I'll buzz you right in. You are entering an Orange Tag Restricted Zone. Dysfunctional Patients only. So I see you got yourself a blue card. Authorized Personnel only. Oh, sorry. Go right on ahead. We can't take anybody out of here. All right, fine, we'll take some people out. Oh, Honey? Sweetheart? Hey, how are... Oh. Oh. Oh, Baby. Oh, no, no, no, no, don't touch her, don't touch her. See the orange wrist band? That means she's dangerous. Just a little girl. Oh, yeah, she's a real monster. Britney? Britney? Britney, Honey. Honey.. Leave me alone! Listen.. Leave us all alone. Listen, I came here to help. I came here to get you and Bud, okay? I came here to take you home. Home? Home? Just as soon as, yes, you remember home? As soon as we find Todd we can leave. Todd? Todd, Honey? What do you need to find him, for? Honey, I know you can't hug me back, but it's okay, because I'm gonna take you home and make you all better, okay? Can we get going? With all the cameras.. I think you can leave now. Okay, come on. Come on. Let's go home! I thought I told you not to mess with the mentals? I have business with these patients. Not anymore. Oh yeah, Bitch? I've just about had enough of you motherfuckers. Can we go, now? Here, take this gun, Todd. Put on these clothes. These patients aren't to leave this room. Oh, yeah, I knew this was coming. We're supposed to take them out. That's a Medical Clearance Pass Card. These are military prisoners. Um, we have orders to take them to the lab to test them for possibly contagious diseases. Ensign Minor? Yes, Ma'am. Check their wrists. Clean. Move 'em out. Thank you. Spread out to the sides. You, take center. Round 'em up. All you patients, I want you against the walls. Come on. Please, stop. No more. I don't like this place, you guys. Shh. Buddy doesn't like it either, okay? Do you know where we're going? I saw them take the garbage out this way, I think there's an exit. She doesn't know where we're going. What is it? Oh! Sorry. Why don't we just get the hell out of here, okay? Whoa, no, don't touch it. We're not allowed to hurt 'em! Britney! I hate this place! Get me out of here! I'm gonna get you out of here, come on, pick yourself up and walk. I can't! Come on, Guys, come on! Come on go, go, go, go, go. You're gonna have to get Bud up. Buddy? Buddy? You guys go up, I'll take him, I'll take him. Go, walk up. Can you walk? Come on. Oh! Oh, great. Take a step up. Take a step... Shh. What are you doing? Here, you like the smell of my clothes? Take 'em. Go! Go! Move! Britney! Britney! Britney! Britney! Britney! Britney! Come on, come on. It's okay. Shh. It's okay. It's okay, you're safe now. Safe? You're safe. Safe, how am I safe now! How? Don't be sad. Don't be sad, they'll be better off now, you'll see. What are you talking about? They're dead. They're dead. Where's Todd? Where's Todd? He ran away. He ran away. They did something to him. They did something, messed up his brain, they made him crazy. Who? The aliens! The aliens! Shh. They must've, they did experiments on my friends. They made Todd kill Britney, and now they're out, they're out, they're out, they're out. Shh. We have to let people know, we have to let people know about this. We have to get out of here. Which way is out? This way? I don't know, I don't know! This isn't exactly my department. We have to get out. Please. Ah, we're breaking so many rules. What rules? What are you.. I don't wanna get you in any more trouble. This place is falling apart. This way. It can't be. What is it? What's wrong? I'm still on it. We're still on it. They're working together. What? What are you talking about? The army is working with the aliens. Okay, you're not making any sense. Look, don't you see? The entire hospital is on their space ship. It's okay, hold on. It's okay, it's all right. I just do my job, okay? I don't really know what the big plan is. You've known about this the whole time? Yes! Haven't you? I thought I was on Earth. I thought that I was going home. Home? So it's true what they say about you, that you were never totally debriefed? That... What, that you're some kind of spy? I'm not a spy. How do you know for sure? I don't know anything, anymore. Todd, Todd, Todd please. Oh, oh! Oh... It's okay. It's okay. Kiss me one more time? That's all I wanna remember. I'm so sorry. Just one kiss. You should've listened to your doctors. They knew what was up. You shoulda let them drill your head while you had a chance. Todd, you've been brainwashed. They tried to do it to me, but you can fight it. Todd, please.. Would you stop calling me Todd! Oh, God. That's right! Now you know what you're dealing with! Oh! No, no, no, no, no. Humans stay in their pods. You don't open this, you don't open this ever. Hello, Little One. Soon you'll be one of us, yes. Let's see you. Let's see you. Oh, yes, oh, yes. The time is now, yes, Little One. Oh, you're ready. I have something for you, yes I do. This will make you one of us. It won't hurt. Just a little one of us. One of us, yes. Soon. Any questions? You killed Britney. No, no, no, no, I shot her, that's all. You killed her. I did not kill anyone! See? Go a little further, you'll find what you're looking for. You see? You see? You see? Do you see how screwed up you are? Somebody put a bug in the back of your neck, and now you can't even remember who you really are. You think you're her. You think you're her, don't you? Some pitiful slab of meat. That's who you think you are. I know who I am. Not like I do. Do you really know who you are? Yes! Prove it, then. For the sake of your entire stinking race. Would you prefer being human? We never kill our own kind. Never. Every human being that we have ever taken is still alive. In here, and in other places. We never end their lives. And here you are, feeling just like a human. Even thinking that you are one. So what's the first thing that you do? Murder. Is it any wonder we feel it our duty to breed mankind out of existence? What are you gonna do, shoot me? That was the plan, yes. But now if we do there's no way to replace you, and we need a copy of you back on Earth. Now there's nothing left to build on, so let's try it another route. Doctor Booker. Yes. You started this whole mess, now you clean it up. Come closer, Jean. So, this is your creation, Doctor? Yes. And her collective memory has been nerve blocked successfully? I attempted it, yes. No collective memory, no symbiotic society. No knowledge of her birth world. She must feel totally alone. Doctor Booker, I think you owe this girl an apology. I'm sorry. How touching. Remove the block. Remove it now. Soon you'll join us and the fear will be gone. Then you'll return to Earth, to your old human life. You'll do our work from there. Will I still be who I am? I hate to tell you but right now, you aren't anyone at all. Bring her back, alive. It'll all be over soon. Get this finished with, Doctor. Now. Stand still. This will only pinch for a second. Excellent, thank you Doctor. You know, you have been a lot of trouble. You shouldn't have done that. We'll grow another one. Well what if he really didn't remove the nerve staple? What if it's just part of the act? Jean, what are these? Letters. Numbers. And a symbol for the Collective. I'm ready to serve. He removed it. Grow another batch of her friends, I want them all in place on Earth by this afternoon. She can wear what she has on. Hey! Hey, over here! Hey! Are you okay? Hey! Are you guys okay down there? Yeah, we're okay. We've got a rescue team coming on the way, they should be here in just a few minutes. Yeah, we're just a little hungry and tired. Of course, of course, here, hydrate yourselves, have something to drink. You know, you guys are like, national heroes now. I mean, lasting as long as you did. You must have quite a story to tell. We just wanna go home. Well, you might find that kinda difficult, seeing as how your house has pretty much turned into a TV station with all the reporters and such. Which uh, if you don't mind me being the first to ask, what exactly happened?
