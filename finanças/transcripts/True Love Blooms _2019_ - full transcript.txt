- Hi, I'm Vikki George, and welcome to the Community Garden. This is a space where people who don't have gardens of their own get a plot of land and get to build the garden of their dreams. So, today, you guys are gonna get a plot and the flowers that you plant of your very own will become fully in bloom in time for our Garden Walk Festival at the end of the month. Yeah. - Is this your garden? - No, sweetie. But I do manage the Community Garden. My dad started this garden 20 years ago. For him, it was a way to give something back to the neighborhood. So, who's ready to see their plot? - Me! - Are you! All of you? - Yes! - Okay, follow me. So ta-da! This is your garden clubs plot. Now does everybody have their seedlings? - Yes! - Okay great! Well, let's get to planting. Grab a shovel, dig on in. - This was a great idea. All of our kids live in apartments. They don't have a garden at home. - Well, that's why we have the space. Everybody deserves a right to cultivate a green thumb. And you would be surprised how fast those flowers will grow. I think they're really gonna enjoy their weekly visits. Oh! Please come back for the Garden Walk at the end of the month. It's our big yearly festival. - Vikki! Vikki George! - Hi Mr. Boyle, hi Ms. Hewitt. Isn't it a lovely day? - Vikki, I thought you should have these. All the rain we had this winter, my tomatoes ripened early. - The first crop of spring, have a look at these beauties. - Oh! Wait, all of this is for me? - There'd be plenty more where that came from. I can tell I'm gonna have a bumper crop this year. - Well, me too. I have a perfect stuffed tomato recipe to give you. It's delicious. - And stuffed peppers. Don't forget the peppers Ms. Hewitt. - You'd never let me Mr. Boyle. You can use the same recipe with the peppers. - Thank you. I think it sounds like a delicious combination. Also, I made up flyers for the Garden Walk Festival. - Oh, we gonna win Best Garden this year? - We've got our fingers crossed. - This is gonna be our year, I can feel it. Besides, can you guys imagine a more beautiful garden than ours? I'm late, I'm late, I know I'm late! Ooh, sorry to interrupt you guys! I got stuck at the Community Garden giving a school tour. - Hey Vikki, I was just dropping off her lunch. - I forgot it again. Maybe on purpose. - You guys are so cute together. Like seriously, too cute. I can't believe you've been married for 12 years. - See you at home honey. - How do you do it Anna? - Vikki, you too could have it all if you put half the energy you put into that garden into your dating life. - Ah, that is a horse that I'm not interested in climbing back on. Thank you. - Yeah, well, maybe if your last boyfriend hadn't just gone riding into the sunset. - I know. I cultivated it. I waited for the fruits to bloom and then nothing. We just broke up. Okay fine, he broke up with me. And with no explanation. - You weren't right for each other to begin with. - It doesn't matter. Dating is just not for me. Not now, maybe not ever. I'm done. You know, you are so lucky you met Alex in high school. You guys are like the perfect couple. - Yeah, we are pretty perfect. For each other. And if you just put yourself out there, you can find someone that's pretty perfect for you too. - Oh really? Do you remember what happened the last time I took your advice and I put myself out there? I met Barry. - That one was doomed from the start. The guy was severely allergic to flowers. - I know, and I work with flowers all day. I mean, I practically am a flower. He had to take an antihistamine before every date. Besides, I don't really have time to date. I've got Garden Walk in a month, and I have to make sure every plot in that garden is perfect. - And knowing you, I'm sure you will. - Oh, good afternoon Mr. Devine. - Ilya, how many times have I told you, call me Chace. - Oh, I'm sorry, Chace. - Thank you. I'm just going to look at a new property, but you can reach me on my phone. - Oh Chace, I just wanted to say thank you. - For what? - You gave my brother a job on your newest development and I just wanted you to know I'm very grateful. - Don't be. Plus, it's part of what we do here. Create jobs. I gotta get going. I'll see you when I get back? - Okay. - You're gonna have to let me post that. Gorgeous! I'm gonna use this to post a story on social media about the Garden Walk Festival. - Oh great, the more the merrier. I'm actually having flyers printed up to distribute as well. - You are so old school. You need to get on social media. - No. - No, it's great for everything! Friendships, staying connected. Dating. - I would prefer to meet someone the old fashioned way. You know, like through friends, or at a cafe. - There's a cafe app for that. - Thanks but no thanks. Suite yourself. - Excuse me, I'm looking for Vikki George. - Oh. - Oh! - Oh, I am. Oh, I am so sorry. Here, let me just. - No. - If I wait a bit. - Just, making it worse. - It's just rubbing it in. - Okay, that's gonna need to go to the cleaners. - It's okay, it'll be fine. - Sorry. - Maybe you can help me. I'm looking for Victoria George. - Victoria? Everybody usually just calls me Vikki. - Oh. - Almost did it again! Occupational hazard. The dirt. Anyway, yup. I'm Vikki George. - I'm Chace Devine. I was told that you could give me a tour of the garden, maybe answer a few questions? - Oh, I'd be happy to. I am the manager. And after all, you actually came at the perfect time. Spring has sprung and everything is fully in bloom. It's my favorite time of year. So this is Serena. - Hi. - She made her plot completely out of wildflowers. If you came here at six a.m., the aroma coming from Serena's plot, it's just indescribable. It's as if night blooming Jasmine and honeysuckle had a baby. Oh, and these are our resident vegetable gardeners. Mr. Boyle grows the most elegant peppers. And Mrs. Hewitt, the most beautiful tomatoes. This is Chace Devine, he's just taking a tour of the garden. - Well, he can't leave without a tomato. No one leaves our garden without a tomato. - Thank you, but I... - Of course he doesn't want one. Not unless he has one of these bad boys. - Okay. - Have another tomato. Now you've got enough to make a nice fresh tomato sauce. - What are you doing Mrs. Hewitt? - I'm just helping this nice man with his dinner plans. - Really? You're being the sweet old lady with a vine ripened tomato. And I'm just the old codger with the peppers. Vikki, would you please tell her that... - Don't you drag Vikki into this, she's on a tour. - They're actually very sweet. They just get a little competitive over their vegetables. But, anyway, that's our garden. Unfortunately right now we don't have any available plots, but if you'd like, I can put you on the wait list. As long as you can prove neighborhood residency, it shouldn't be a problem. - Those weren't exactly the kind of questions I had. - Oh? - I've studied the zoning law, so there's no questions there. - Why do you care about our zoning laws? - Just trying to think practically. - Yeah, but about what? - About how to properly utilize this space. - Well, it's a garden, so you properly utilize it by gardening. You know what, I'm just gonna add you to the wait list. Way down at the bottom. - There's no need to do that. I'm not waiting. - Tell me Mr. Devine, what does your garden grow? - Condos, from the ground up. Thanks for the tour. It's really a beautiful space. Exactly what I'm looking for. - "Devine Construction, building better from the ground up." - Chace Devine is a real estate developer. He builds condos. - "From the ground up." That's what he said to me at the garden. - What do you think this means? - I don't know. But I'm not liking the feeling I'm getting. I think maybe I should talk to Mr. Mack. - That's a great idea. I mean you've been renting from him forever. He'll know what's going on. - I'm sure there's nothing to worry about. He loves the garden. - Yeah. - My hands are tied Vikki. - But Mr. Mack, you love the garden. You've told me so yourself. - I do love it. And I loved your dad. Our deal goes back to when he first started the Community Garden 20 years ago. - I know, so then why are you selling? - My daughter lives in Hawaii and she's having a baby in a couple of months. It's gonna be my first grandchild. - Well that's great news, but... - Palm trees and golden sandy beaches that extend for miles. How does that sound to you Vikki? - Like Florida. Where we live already. - I'm ready to retire. Be around family. - But do you have to sell the garden? - I sold the garden this morning Vikki. - What? No, not to Devine Construction. - I was gonna come over to the nursery and tell you in person, but yes it's sold. And yes to Chace Devine. - Mr. Mack, that garden was my dads dream. A garden for the community. A garden for everyone. - The garden has always been an investment property. I made the deal with your dad because we were old army buddies and he had this dream and I just couldn't refuse him. But I never planned on making any money off of it. And then comes Chace Devine and he offered me a lot of money Vikki. Retirement money. Spoil my grandchild money. - But why didn't you at least give us a chance to match the offer? - Because you don't have that kind of money Vikki. You would have bought this place long ago if you did. I'm very sorry. But you know what? It's time for you to make a new place for it. I mean do what your dad did when he first started the Community Garden. I mean show some gumption. - Gumption? - That was one of your dad's greatest qualities. Gumption, initiative. Find the new spot for the garden and build it back. - From the ground up. - Exactly, from the ground up. - Thanks mom. Your veggie lasagna always cheers me up. - Well, things will seem a lot brighter once you've got something in your stomach. You'll see. - I think it's gonna take more than lasagna to fix this problem. - I've got carrot cake for dessert. - It's gonna take more than that too. Although I definitely wanna have that cake. I don't know, I just feel like the garden was dad's legacy to the neighborhood. And I just feel like I'd be letting everybody down if I just let it go. You, the neighborhood, dad. Especially dad. - Vikki honey, don't put this all on yourself. - But it is on me mom. It's all right on top of me and I'm here at the bottom just being crushed by it. I mean he built that garden out of nothing, and there is no way dad would let anybody like Chace Devine stand in the way of his dream. - Have you tried talking to this Chace Devine? - Ugh. - Maybe he's not as bad as you think he is. First impressions can be deceiving. - You're right. You're right mom. There's gotta be a solution. Maybe if he just understood how important the garden was to the community. I mean, he's gotta have a heart underneath that well-tailored, very expensive looking suit somewhere. - Well sweetheart, there's only way to find out. Go to his office and show him exactly how persuasive you can be. - So not me. Look up, there's a way over every obstacle. - So, tell me. What do you think? I went for minimalism. I thought it spoke power. And you honey are the most powerful man I know. Less is more right? I wanted it to feel like an empty room. - Well it does feel that way. Which makes me wonder, how did you spend that much money if you're going for nothing? - I only bought the best. - Uh huh. - Take that sculpture. It's my favorite piece. Sure it cost $2,000, but it's brilliant because it's like a little table but nothing will ever go on it. Minimalism. So? You like it! Thank you Chace. Thank you for giving me this opportunity. I always thought that I could be a designer, but no one ever gave me the chance. - Well, you did a bang up job. - You really think so? - Yeah. - I'm so glad. This has been more than design. This has been a voyage of self-discovery. - Okay. - It's inspired me to go minimal myself. - That's great. - I mean it Chace. I'm gonna start paring down, start fresh. - Yeah. - Next time you see me, I'll be a whole new Marta. We should celebrate! - We will celebrate, tonight. I just purchased a new property. It's a garden I'm converting into condos. - Ooh. - So we'll celebrate the condos and you. - Okay! - Okay? Yeah, see ya tonight. Whole new Marta. Minimalism. - I'm sorry, but no one sees Mr. Devine without an appointment. - This is important. If you could please just buzz his office and tell him that Vikki George is here, I'm pretty sure he'd be willing to see me. - I'm sorry, but we don't make exceptions. Now, if you'd like to make an appointment... - No, I don't have time for that. This is a pressing matter. - Everything in Mr. Devine's life is a pressing matter. I'm sorry, but you're going to have to go. - Fine. But I'm taking this back. - Ilya, I need you. Chace and I are celebrating tonight. He loved the new office. I need you to make the reservations. Some place classy like Shiro's. I'm so happy Ilya, he really loved it. - Oh, hi. - Hi? - Sorry, do you remember me? - Of course, from the garden, right. Do we have an appointment? - No, but you know what? Appointments are so formal, and I'm more like a fly by the seat of my pants type gal. And anyway, I just need to speak to you about something for a minute. It'll just take a minute of your time. - For you I have several. Like two. - Oh. Well, I brought you a peace offering. Like literally, this is called a peace lily. - I didn't realize we were at war. - A little sunlight, some water, and this guy's gonna flourish. And you could definitely use some green in here. I mean, it is sparse. - It's minimalist. - Yeah, well there's very little in here so, well done. - I assume you didn't come here to bring me a plant. - Oh, I just never go anywhere empty handed. But yeah, I wanted to talk to you about the Community Garden. - What about the garden? - You can't dig up our garden. I mean it's a vital part of our community. We host numerous year-round events. Children have their birthdays there. My best friends got married there, but it's not just that. It's a beacon. I mean it reminds people that you can come together, and you can't just take that away. - What do you propose? - Well I was sort of wondering if you could just find it in your heart to renew our lease and save our garden. - Vikki, right? - Yeah. - I'm a business man. Anyway you slice it, gardens don't bring in the green the way condos do. And people depend on me to bring in the green. See, I've acquired all the land around the garden, which functions as a parking lot. But now that I've acquired the garden as well, my company can build condos for people to live in. I wish I could help you, but it's business, not personal. - You know, the thing is it is personal. And I think that you are making a terrible mistake. And I'm gonna prove it to you. - I'd love to see that. - Oh, you will see it. Because I'm gonna be back with concrete proof. Which you'll appreciate because there's concrete in buildings and that's the only thing you seem to care about anyway. So, I'll be back. - Look forward to it! - Guys, if I could just borrow you for a minute. If everybody could gather around, thanks. So I know that some of you have heard by now that our beloved Community Garden is in trouble. A developer named Chace Devine has bought the garden and he plans to rip it out and build condos. - That's awful. - We have to do something. - You're right, we do. - Then he'll think twice about bringing his condos into our neighborhood. - But how do we do that? - We can have a bake sale. - Oh, what a good idea! I have a good cupcake recipe. - Please, guys. I have an idea. I think if we could just start a petition, we gather as many signatures as we can and that way we can show how much support we have within the neighborhood. - If he's a man of business, he can't deny something black and white right in front of him. - I can start an online petition too. Post it on social media, every single platform. - Oh, that's a great idea! We can use as many signatures as we can get. - What about the Garden Walk Festival? It's only three weeks away. Are we still participating? - This year more than ever. Not only are we gonna participate, we're gonna win that Garden Walk. This year, when our neighbors open their doors to their gardens, we should be front and center. If we can win best garden, Chace Devine is gonna have a very difficult time ripping out this garden and then having to justify it to the entire neighborhood. I think if we can stand together, we can stop him from taking down our garden. Now who is with me! - Yes! - We can do it! - Let's save our garden! - All of us. - Okay, everybody grab your clipboards. You're good. We need to get as many signatures as possible. Thank you so much. Here you go. - Save our garden. Thank you. - Oh hey! Could you sign? Right here. Thank you. - Hi, do you mind signing save the garden real quick? - Sure, sure. - Right there. - Another tomato Mr. Boyle. I'm almost done with my basket. - That's because these baskets hold more peppers than tomatoes. Sign here, get two peppers. - Two tomatoes with every signature! Two. - Hey, great. Thank you. Back right on time. Thank you. Awesome, thank you. - Got it! - I got 75 signatures. - I got 82. - And make sure there's plenty of reporters at the ground breaking ceremony. We need the name Devine Construction in a positive light as much as possible. After that, we'll focus on the garden property. There's been a little push back from the community. Nothing we haven't seen before. Well don't worry. We're set and on schedule with the garden property. Nothing's gonna hold it up. Yeah, I'm gonna have to call you back. Hi. - What's that? - What, the plant? It's a gift from Vikki George. - And who is Vikki George? - She's a disgruntled citizen. Runs the Community Garden I just bought. - And she brought you a plant? - What? She was just trying to convince me not to build over the garden. She's very passionate, I admire that. - Well, I don't admire that. It doesn't work with the minimalism Chace. - Don't you think it brings the space a sort of homey quality? - We're not going for homey. I'm just gonna... - I like the plant. Even if it doesn't match the aesthetic. - Come on Chace. You Know you've really helped me change my entire outlook. - How so? - Not only am I looking into designing full-time, but I've been going through my apartment and giving away all the things I don't use to charities. It just feels so good to pare down. - Well that's very admirable. - Well, I guess Vikki George isn't the only one you admire. I'll see you later. - Where are you going? - Shopping. I may have gone a little too overboard giving things away. - Ah. - I need to make a reservation with a personal shopper. The Mayoral Gala is coming up and I need to look my best. - Hi. Me again. - Did you have an appointment or do you just not believe in them? - Oh come on, we're old friends. Friends don't let friends appoint. Besides, I brought you something. And this one doesn't require as much water as the other one. And it can keep this little guy company. - What are you doing here Ms. George? I assume it's not to bring me another plant. - Well, first of all, I think I've asked you to call me Vikki. Second, you just like to get right down to business don't ya? Okay, fine. Here you go. Concrete proof. - Proof of what? - Proof of what the garden means to the community. That's a petition to save the garden and not cold-heartedly rip out peoples plants and destroy peoples dreams. AKA, build your condos. 'Cause I've got over 1,000 signatures, which means I don't think your condos are gonna go over very well with the neighborhood which is really something you should consider. - 1,000 plus signatures. You did this pretty quickly. - Well it's easy when you believe in something. And I believe in this garden. - I'm impressed Ms. George. - Oh, Vikki. - Vikki, right. Shows a lot of... - Gumption? - Gumption. Yes. I like that word. You don't hear it very often. - It was one of my father's favorites. So? - So, I'm impressed with your gumption. Impressed but not convinced. See, even 10,000 signatures wouldn't change my mind. - But we have the whole neighborhood standing with us. - It's like I said before, it's business not personal. Also, if I change my mind it impacts a whole slew of people. - This isn't over. I'll be back. - I assume without an appointment. I look forward to it. - Well you shouldn't, because when I put my mind to something, it usually happens. - Well when I set my mind to something it happens as well. - Well good, then we have one thing in common. - Yes, but that means we have an impasse too. - But there's a way over any impasse. - 1,000 signatures. She's really something. Don't look at me like that. - Wow, I guess it's official. We're being evicted by Devine Construction. We have to be out in less than a month. That's right after Garden Walk. - A lot can happen in a month. So what are you gonna do sweetheart? - I don't know. I mean, I guess the only thing I can do, show Chace Devine just how much fight I have in me. - You are your father's daughter. - What do you think dad would do? - Sleep on it. It'll come to you. You've got the drive, all you need is a plan. - A plan to stop Chace Devine. I know exactly what to do. - Hi. I see the press is here. - Yup, from all the local papers. We even got TV. - Great. We need all the good press we can get. We're breaking ground on the garden property next month and I don't want any controversy around my name. Fingers crossed, we can have both crews working full-time. - I think we can handle that. - Yeah. - You about ready? We don't wanna keep them waiting too long. - As ready as I'll ever be. Thank you all for coming out witness Devine Construction's 20th build. It's gonna be a landmark property that we think will bring a sleek, modern look to Saint Petersburg. - Grow flowers, not towers! Grow flowers, not towers! Grow flowers, not towers! Grow flowers, not towers! - Change is hard. - Grow flowers, not towers! - Grow flowers, not towers! Grow flowers, not towers! Grow flowers, not towers! - Guys, guys! - What is all this? - Oh, this is for your office. You know, I didn't want come empty-handed. - You're leading a protest. - It doesn't mean I have to be rude. - What is it gonna take for you to stop this? - You, saving our Community Garden! - I already told you Vikki, that's not gonna happen. - Well then this isn't gonna stop. Because I told you that I was gonna fight. - Even if you can't win? - Not so sure about that. I mean, just how much bad press can you afford Chace Devine? - Excuse me, but are you available for an interview? - I would love to do an interview! - Can I get your name? - Yes, my name is Vikki George and I represent the Community Garden in Saint Petersburg. Last week Mr. Devine here bought our garden in an attempt to tear it down and build condos. So today, we're here to stop him. - Not only is she stealing my publicity, but she's making me out to be the bad guy. - Well aren't you the bad guy? - No. It's not a black and white issue. People need housing in this city and we provide that. Saint Petersburg is growing at a rapid pace and if housing doesn't grow with it, the prices are gonna become unaffordable and... You really think I'm the bad guy? - You're taking away their garden. - To give people a place to live. - Okay, whatever you say. - Do you realize that giving people jobs, providing housing, it's why I do what I do Marta. - Well, maybe you could do something different. You inspired me to change for the better. Maybe it's time you make a change. - You guys, listen. I know that everybody has seen the headlines and that was a great start, but that's all that was, a start. Having the public on our side is not our ultimate goal. Right now, there is one man and one man alone who controls our fate and that is Chace Devine. - So what can we do? - We make it so he can't ignore us. We have to keep infusing ourselves into community events so he sees how important we truly are. - What about our Annual Ladybug Release? - What do you mean? - What if we open it up to the whole neighborhood? - That's a great idea. That's a great idea! We make it a true event. We invite everyone, including Chace Devine. We show him the kinds of things that we do here. Once he sees the community part of the Community Garden, he's gonna have second thoughts about shutting us down. Serena, you're a genius. - Yes, I saw the news, but it's gonna blow over in a week, I promise. We proceed on schedule. The public has a short attention span but... I'm gonna have to call you back. Vikki George. - Chace Devine, this is for you. It's an olive branch. Actually, it's an olive tree, but I think you catch my drift. It's for your office. You could really use some green in there. - I'd love to stay and chat, but I have a meeting. - Oh great, I'll walk with you. - My own personal escort. - Something like that. First of all I want to apologize for hijacking the groundbreaking ceremony. - It was just a bump in the road, but thank you. - And ask a favor. - You have a favor. - Yes. So, we're hosting an event. A ladybug release. And I'd really like for you to come. See how important the garden is to the community. - I don't get it. Why are you doing this? Can't you just plant your flowers somewhere else? - This garden was started by my dad. It was his passion project before he died. - I'm sorry, I didn't know. - It's okay. He died three years ago, which is both a long time and also no time at all. It was just really important to him that everybody have a little piece of land to call their own. Pride of ownership. That's what he used to say. - You know, my dad passed away when I was young. It forced me to grow up real fast. I had to take care of my mom. Everything I did was to keep her happy and cared for. She passed away last year. - I'm so sorry. - There's a lot we don't know about each other. - You never know, in another life we might have been friends. - You never know. Tell you what, I can't guarantee that I can make it to the? - Ladybug release. - Ladybug release. I've got a really packed schedule, but I can guarantee that I'll try. Hopefully that's good enough. - It'll have to be. Thank you for trying. - Oh, and thank you for, for your olive branch. I'll add it to my collection. - Good. I'll make a gardener out of you yet. - I wouldn't count on it! - Look, look at this one. - Ah, you can do this, right? But she likes you. Let's just walk in and say hello. Nope. - Are you here for the ladybug release? - I guess. I guess I am. - Well we better hurry. You know, this is a historical occasion. This could be the last ladybug release before that horrible real estate developer takes over the garden. Are you coming in? - You go ahead, I'll be in in a minute. - What do you think it means? I think it means that he's warming up to me. I mean warming up to the idea of saving the garden. Why else would he get me a plant? - Maybe he likes you. - No way! - Oh he definitely likes you. - There is not a chance. - Why else would he bring you a plant? He's flirting with you. - He is not flirting with me. He is not flirting with me, okay? He is mister dress to the nines business man and I'm, me. You know, I like to think of myself as happy and carefree, and I don't think those two words are in his vocabulary. - I don't know. But you know what they say, opposites attract. Besides, are you really so different? I mean you're both very determined people. Well maybe he's attracted to that. - That may be, but yeah, we are different. Very different. Too different. Besides, have you seen his girlfriend? - He has a girlfriend? - Does he have a girlfriend? I mean she's so gorgeous that you can hear the whiplash when the heads turn when she walks in the room. - Aye, but is she determined? - You are infuriating. This conversation's over. - Okay, okay! He may not like you, but I know you and I think you like him. Just a little bit. - Come in! - You had a delivery come in. - Oh, thanks Ilya. Those are the documents for the garden property. Hey Ilya. Have you been following this whole Community Garden mess? - Of course. It's part of my job. - What's your opinion on it? Your honest opinion now. Pretend you're not talking to your boss. - My honest opinion? - Mm hmm. - Well, I'm a gardener. And gardens have always been special to me. They're soothing, meditative. Besides, there's no greater feeling than caring for something and watching it flourish. - That's how I feel about my buildings. Not only do they provide jobs for the people who construct them, but the construction themselves become housing. Homes. Plus, I'm really proud of them. - Well, maybe you can show her that. - Who? Vikki George? - Maybe if she can see from your point of view she'd appreciate it. Would you like me to take care of those for you? - No. No, they're my plants. I'm responsible for them. Ilya, you just gave me a great idea. Thank you. You're right. - Vikki! - Yeah. - Vikki! - Yeah. - You have a visitor. - Who is it? - He's coming in now. - Chace Devine. - Vikki George. - Didn't expect this. You, to see you. For you to come here. You know what I mean. This is my best friend Anna. - Oh. - Hi. - Please to meet you. Though, if you're part of the garden community, I'm sure I'm not your favorite person right now. - You're not not my favorite person right now. Especially if you're here for the reason I think you're here for. - Okay. - I'll go. I'll be by the register. - That's a good idea. I'm not even gonna begin to try to decipher for you what she meant. - It's okay. - Okay. - So, what are you working on? - Well, it's tulip season so... You wanna smell 'em? - Sure. It smells like spring? - I know, most people think they have no scent, but I think they smell like heaven. For you. - What? - Yes, for you. - No. At least let me pay for this one. You're running a business here. - It's a gift. Besides, I've seen your office, we both know you need those tulips more than I do. - Okay, thank you. So, I'm here to... Are you free today? There's something I wanna show you. - Well, we are pretty busy. - Oh. - But yeah, I guess I could sneak away. What'd ya have in mind? - Actually, we're running two months ahead of schedule. - Really? - We're efficient. It's something I'm very proud of. Besides, we've got about 75 people on this site, another 20 back at the office. It's quite a lot of jobs on this build. - Mr. Devine, the foreman's looking for you. - Thanks Mark. Hey, there's someone I want you to meet. This is Vikki George. - Nice to meet you. - A new friend of Chace Devine is a friend of mine. - How's the family? - Ah they're doing great, really great. He's always asking about my family. You see, a couple of years ago I lost my job. I met Mr. Devine, he personally hired me on his regular crew. - Mark's being very generous. You're one of the best employees I got. We couldn't do the work we do without you. - Honestly, if he wasn't able to keep our crew working, we'd all be out of a job. But enough chit-chat about that, this building isn't gonna build itself. Chace, don't forget about the foreman. - You got it. - Very nice to meet you Ms. George. - Yes, very nice to meet you as well. Wow, I had no idea you were responsible for so many people. - It's not just about the buildings it's about how they get here. And the source of pride they are to the architects, and the construction workers, and everyone else involved. - Hm. You know, I have to admit that I never even considered any of that. - Hey, what are you doing right now? It's a beautiful spring day, how about lunch? - Together? Okay. - Yeah? - Sure. - Great. I'll make a reservation at Shiro's. - I think if we're gonna have lunch, we should do it on my terms. I am really glad you showed me that build site. - I just wanted to open your eyes, help you see that I'm not a monster. - I never thought you were a monster. Alright, maybe just a little bit. Like a small corporate troglodyte. But can I ask you a question, seriously. How come you didn't come to the ladybug release? - Oh it didn't seem appropriate with me being the one taking away the garden. I didn't wanna seem like a villain. Hey, if I could figure out a way to save the garden and put up my building, I would. But as it stands, there's too many people depending on me. - Okay. But I am gonna keep trying to change your mind because I have a lot of people depending on me as well. - Well, we'll just have to agree to disagree. - For now. But I'm pretty sure you're gonna come around to my way of thinking eventually. - I don't know about that. - Very persuasive. No way. It's a four leaf clover. - Wow. - You know what this means don't you? Good luck is coming our way. - Let me see. So when does the good luck start? - Who knows, maybe it already has. - No, what does that mean for the two of us? We want different things. - Do we? I just mean... - Ah! Okay. - Oh no. - Maybe we should... - Yeah, no, we should go. - I've got a meeting. - I mean I have to get back to the nursery. - Yeah. - Rain. Got it. - Thanks for lunch Vikki. It's always an adventure. - It was my pleasure. This looks so nice, thanks for having me to dinner. - Oh we always love having you. - He got the recipe from Ms. Hewitt. - Oh, but don't tell her I'm using Mr. Boyle's peppers. - My lips are sealed. - Good. I hope you like spicy. - Yeah. - Speaking of spicy, tell me about your date with Chace Devine. - It wasn't a date. - You had lunch. A picnic lunch. - Half a picnic lunch. There was a rain delay, so half a picnic. - Still, half. - It was interesting. You know, I guess I never realized how many people are behind the scenes of a man like Chace Devine. I guess this whole time I've been so focused on him being the bad guy, I never thought about things from his point of view. - He opened your eyes. That's cool. - But does that change your mind? - What do you mean? - Well I mean, what about the people from the garden? Are they just supposed to abandon their little spot of green, their plots, their piece of the community just because a developer wants to build condos? - Don't be crazy. Vikki would never abandon the Community Garden. - Of course not. If we were to let go of things like the Community Garden, we'll have no community left. Chace may have opened my eyes to his perspective, but there is nothing that will make me let this garden go. - I'm glad you didn't budge. And you know you have the support of the entire community. But mostly, your best friends support. - Thank you. And don't worry, I am never gonna stop fighting. No matter what. Diane, what are you doing? - Vikki, I'm so sorry. My friend Tim is letting me use some space in his garden and it's a guarantee. It's not going anywhere. Please forgive me. - Of course. Hey, Serena what's going on? - A couple of the gardeners are threatening to drop out of the Community Garden. They see the inevitable coming and they don't want to wait until the last minute. It's only a few weeks until we have to be out of the garden. - Well, no, that's not necessarily true. And you know, it's fine. I'll just call some people on the wait list. - Vikki, people don't wanna join the garden if they know it's gonna go away. No one wants to commit until they know the garden's future is decided. - Well I don't know what I'm supposed to do. Garden Walk is in two weeks and there's no way we're gonna win with a bunch of bald patches everywhere. It's gotta be full and vibrant. - Don't worry, we will rally the troops. The garden will be ready for the Garden Walk Festival. - Thank you Serena. - Yeah. - What am I gonna do with you? Mr. Boyle, good afternoon. Can I help you? - Well Vikki, I need to approach you with a delicate matter. - Shoot. - I wanna move to a new plot. - Really? Now with Garden Walk just around the corner? I've already got one giant bald patch to fill. - I realize the timing isn't the best, but I need to get away from Ms. Hewitt. She's too, distracting. - Distracting? - Yes distracting. Namely her tomatoes are distracting. - And how are her tomatoes distracting? - Oh they're an A-list vegetable Vikki. Which is malarkey. Since technically, technically they're a fruit. Now how are my peppers supposed to compete with her fruit? - Well, the good news is, it's not a competition. - Ah, life's a competition Vikki. And at the moment, my delightful peppers are playing second banana to her fruit. - Maybe if you stopped calling them fruits. - Ah, can't do that. Gotta keep an edge up. - Okay, Mr. Boyle, I will think about it, but this new plot would have to be eye catching. I can't replace a pepper patch that is flourishing with a brand new one that would just be getting started. - I'll plant zucchinis! - How is that different? - Come on, zucchinis! What could be more eye catching than zucchinis? Because they sprout flowers! - I will think about it. Mr. Boyle I promise. - Well you better think quick because Garden Walk is just around the corner. - Don't I know it. Hi. From the ground up. Hi, Chace Devine's voicemail please. Chace, hi, it's Vikki. Remember when I went to your build site? Well it's your turn for a field trip. And I tell you what, I will call your assistant and make an appointment because I know how much you love those. Oh, and if you own anything that's not a suit, wear it. Two trowels. - Two trowels check. Two dibbers. Two pruners. Two people. - I do not like your tone, this is business. - And I think you mean business. - Anna, I'm just doing this to save the garden. - Mm hm. - Am I interrupting? - Oh, no. We were just getting ready for our field trip. - Just getting ready. - You look great in not a suit. It's suits you. - Thank you. I don't usually have the occasion to wear not a suit. - Well, you do today because I am gonna teach you how to garden. - This is gonna be a long lesson. I don't know the first thing about gardening. - Yeah you do. Because the first thing is just knowing what you like. So, step into my parlor and tell me. What do you like? Just take a look around and see which flowers speak to you and we'll go from there. - These. - Yeah? - My mom would always plant them. - See, you've got gardening in your blood. Trust me, you're gonna be a natural. So, these will be the centerpiece and we'll just find other flowers to compliment them. Anna! - Yes. - You wanna help us pick some plants? - Sure. - Great. So, take a look around, see what else you want. - Just, okay. - Yeah. - His mom used to plant azaleas. The plant he got you is an azalea. - Shh, stop it and help me. - How about ornamental sweet potato? You have to admit that means something. - Yeah, it means I remind him of his mother. Not romantic. So, oh! Chace Devine, are you ready to get your hands dirty? - Lead the way. - Okay, so, the first rule of gardening is you can't garden while standing. There you go. - Okay, I get that. How's this? - It's great. - Yeah? - Yeah, I just didn't realize you were so delicate. - I'm not delicate. - You just kneeled down like you were about to be knighted by the queen mum. Okay, show me your hands. Okay. - Okay. - Great, now you're ready to garden. - I wanna just loosen it up right? - Loosen it up and then we're gonna get a shovel and we're gonna dig a proper hole. 'Cause what we're gonna do... - Yeah. - Is we're gonna squeeze this a little bit and make sure it's not root bound. - A little guy. - It's a little guy. We just wanna loosen up the roots a little. So first we'll focus on the centerpiece. We'll get the azalea placement perfect, and then we'll build the rest of the garden around the azaleas. Yeah. How's that placement? - It's perfect. - So not all soil's the same right? - Oh, no. Soil is the most important part of the garden. There's six main types of soil. Feel it. It's kind of soft and soapy to the touch. - Ah, I see what you mean. Here, let me help you out. You clearly don't have enough. There, maybe some here. - Thank you. - Right there. Yeah, dirt suits you. Oh, okay. That's fine. That's fine. 'Cause I didn't really work. I worked really hard on that. - Oh. - Go ahead. - No, that's. Do you need it? - No, go ahead. - I was just gonna clear it out. - Wow, look what we did. - I know. Not too shabby if I do say so myself. - I mean it's nice to see what we can do when we work together. - Yeah. It is. - Whoa, I gotta go. You're okay here right? - Yeah no, good. I gotta finish up anyway, make sure everything's pristine. Sort of how I roll. - Thanks for today. It brought me back to when I started working construction. It felt good to work with my hands. - Oh. Good. - Well, see ya around Victoria George. - Sorry. Vikki! Vikki I have to use the... - Oh my gosh Anna, are you okay? You're out of breath. - I know, I need to up my cardio. Ooh, do we have oxygen? Tell me we have oxygen. - Anna, what is it? - There's a gala, tonight. A Mayoral Gala. - Well that is very exciting, but we are not invited. - But what if we crashed it? - What? Why would we crash it? - Because the mayor will be there. Maybe you can talk to the mayor and convince her to declare the garden some sort of landmark or something. - So Chace Devine can't build his condos. - Exactly. - Wait, but why would she declare it a landmark? - Okay, not a landmark, but I don't know. It's been 20 years since your dad started the garden. It's been a part of the community for a long time. That has to mean something. - I don't know, crashing the event, that just seems crazy. - Vikki! We have two weeks before we have to be out of the garden. This might be the sort of hail Mary play we need. So put on your big girl pants and let's crash the gala. - I mean we live in a world with so much stuff. And I was so focused on things that I didn't really have a path. And now look at me. I'm a designer who focuses on minimalism. You know who the real enemy is? Tchotchke's. - Would you like to dance? - Oh, that would be wonderful. - So just give him the invitation. - You give him the invitation. - Don't tell me you forgot the invitation. - You were supposed to bring the invitation. - No, I distinctly remember telling you to bring the invitation. - And I told you to bring the invitation. - She forgot the invitation. - I can't believe we got in here. - I know. I told you, all we had to do was look the part and say we forgot the tickets. - Do you see the mayor anywhere? - Oh look, there she is. - Okay let's go. - Thank you for the donation. Enjoy your night. - Oh madam mayor, I'm so sorry to interrupt. - No don't worry, I'm happy to speak with you. - My name is Vikki George and I run the Community Garden in Saint Petersburg. - I read about it in the news. - Then you know a developer is planning on tearing it down to build condos on the land? - I read about that too. - Well the reason we approached you is we were hoping that your office could do something. Maybe declare the garden a landmark or a pillar of the community. Something, anything to stop them from building on the land. We could really use your help. - I'm glad you came to me. I always want my constituents to feel like they can talk to me. - Wait, so you'll help us? - I don't know what I can do off hand, but I can have my staff do a little digging and maybe I can get back to you. - I'm sorry to ask, but how quickly would that be? It's just that we're under a little bit of a time crunch. We've got Garden Walk coming up in two weeks. - Tell you what, I will have an answer for you at Garden Walk. - Thank you much madam Mayor. - I can't make any promises. - No, of course not. But just looking into it is promise enough. - It's the promise of hope. - Yeah. Of course, it'll be my pleasure. Now if you'll excuse me. - Sure. It worked. - I know, it worked! - Well fingers crossed it worked. - Yes, fingers crossed... Vikki. - Did you know he was gonna be here? - I'm gonna go get us some drinks. - Vikki. - Chace. - Wow. - Oh, stop. I feel kind of silly dressed like this. - Really, you look beautiful. - Thank you. - So, wanna dance? What about Marta? - Oh, Marta and I broke up. Yeah, we decided it was time to focus on other things. She wanted to minimize everything, including me. - Oh no! Sorry. - I'm not. Really, it's for the best. For both of us. So, about that dance? - I would love to, but the truth is I'm not really sure I know how. - Come on, it's a piece of cake. I'll lead. There we go. Okay, so this goes here. - Okay. - Now you just hold onto me. Thank you. - Hey Chace, can I ask you a favor? - Of course. - Before you make your final decision on the garden, would you come to Garden Walk? I just think it would be a great way for you to see the community spirit in action. - Tonight I couldn't refuse you anything. - It was really my pleasure. - I'm glad. - So you'll come? - You don't stop do you? Where do you get that determination? - My dad. He'd always say "Look up, "there's a way over any obstacle." So I guess I'm just always looking up. - I like that. Sounds like he was a wise man. - He was. - Look up. I guess I'm the obstacle huh? - Look up Chace. - I should let you get back to your friend. But I'll come to the Garden Walk. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Okay you guys, I need everybody to be on their A game. Everything has to be perfect for Garden Walk this year. No cutting corners. Everything's gotta be spot on, and remember, they're judging on fullness, organization, and varieties. Okay you guys, let's get to work. - Vikki! - Yeah! - I have a complaint. - Is it about Mr. Boyle? - Well of course it's Mr. Boyle. - How did I know? - He's helping everyone with their streamers but me. - Okay, but maybe if you just asked him nicely. - Ask? You think I'd actually ask him? Have you heard the rumors? He's been trying to move plots to get away from my tomatoes. There's no way I'd ask him for help with an attitude like that. - Okay, but you do need help. - Yes. - From Mr. Boyle. - Yes. - So what's the solution? - You ask him. - You want me to ask him for you? - Exactly. - Ms. Hewitt. Okay fine. I'll do it, okay. But we really all have to get along. We have to put our differences aside. - I'll put mine aside, once he puts his aside. Is that fair? - I guess it'll have to be. Okay, I'll talk to him. - Thank you. - Oh you're welcome. - Vikki, I wanted to show you the dresses I ordered for the event. - Okay, do we have to do this right now? - I pinned six dresses and ordered them all. Which one's your favorite? - You know what, this one. It's perfect. You're gonna look beautiful! - That one's my favorite too. - Great. - Thank you Vikki. - Oh my god. - Yeah, any word from the Mayor? - No, and she was supposed to give us an answer by Garden Walk. - So she's cutting it close. - Yeah, I know. Aren't we all. - Ladies and gentlemen! Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the 46th annual Saint Petersburg Garden Walk! Have a wonderful day! - Hello, welcome to the garden. Thank you for coming. Thanks for coming. Thank you for coming to the garden. Hope you guys enjoy your time here. Thank you so much. Hey, thank you for coming to the garden. You came. - You're surprised? - I mean a little. - Well I wanted to check on our plot. Make sure you're taking care of it. - You wanna come see for yourself? - After you. - Thank you. - This place looks great. - Mm hm, it's pretty cool what a couple of weeks will do. What do you think? - Wait a minute. This is the, this is the one? I helped do this? - No, you did do this. I helped you. I always say that a garden is like a little slice of home. It's also a reflection of the gardener who planted it. And this garden, especially because of your mom. It's a reflection of you. - I don't know what to say. - You don't have to say anything, you can just kinda take it in. - Hey. - Hey. Hi. So, I guess there's some people I'd like you to meet. Everyone this is Chace Devine. This is Alex. - Hi. - And you know Anna. - And Serena, you guys met before. - Nice to see you again Chace. - Hello. - And this is my mom. - I actually helped Chace plant this azalea garden. - Well I love this garden. - Yeah. - This is the exact spot we danced on our wedding day. - Yes it is. - So they got married here? - Yup. - I had no idea. - We all decorated the garden, did it all in white. It was really a beautiful wedding. You see, our garden's part of the community. People love it as much as I do. They wanna make it a part of their lives, we're like a family. - Don't you think this is a wonderful event? - I do. But you know what would make it even better? A little dancing. - Oh I don't know. - I have just the partner in mind. - Mr. Boyle? - You want me to dance with her? - Why not? - I haven't danced in years! - Come on! It's like riding a bike. - Who would've though the two of us would be dancing together? - They say Garden Walk is a magical time. - I never told you how much I admire your tomatoes. - Thank you Mr. Boyle. - Oh don't mention it. - And I have to say, your peppers are coming in beautifully this year. - Ah they are aren't they? Aren't we a pair? - A pair of old shoes. - But at least they're dancing shoes. - Oh. - Let's do a little spin. - Ladies and gentlemen, please gather around! I am here to announce the winner of this years Garden Walk! Congratulations to The Community Garden! After touring 17 gardens, hands down, you have embraced the beauty, charm, and polish we look for. As well as that community spirit, we cannot deny. - Thank you. - Speech. Speech. - You know, the thing about this Community Garden is it really does belong to the entire community. So this isn't just a win for us gardeners, this is a win for the whole neighborhood. So congratulations to us all! Oh, would you like this? - Congratulations. - Yeah, it is pretty great. Hey, do you wanna see something else that's pretty great? - Sure. - Shh. The butterfly bushes bloomed. - Why are we whispering? - Because I thought it was more charming like that. Okay, just smell it. Come on. - Alright. - Mm, it's heaven. - Wow. - I know right? When I was a little girl I used to pluck the petals off this plant and rub them between my fingers, put 'em on my wrist and pretend like I was wearing perfume. I felt so grown up. You wanna try? - I don't really wanna smell like a flower. - Oh come on. - How 'bout I put it on you? - Okay. - So I just pluck it off like that? - Vikki! Vikki where are you? Vikki! - I think you're needed. - Yeah. - Come on, I'll help you up. - Vikki! - It sounds so important. - Yeah. - Will you excuse me? - Sure. - Vikki come on! - What is it? - The Mayor is here. - The Mayor? - Yes, she's been waiting. Mayor Price. - Vikki, congratulations on your big win today. - Madam Mayor, thank you so much for coming down to the garden. - Well, I wish it could be under better circumstances. - What do you mean? - My office looked into your case and unfortunately there's nothing we can do to help you save the garden. It looks like that decision will entirely be left to Chace Devine. - Well. Thank you so much for trying Mayor Price. - I'm just sorry I couldn't come to you with good news. - Oh I understand. Chace, if there is any way you can think of to save our garden... - I wish I could. - Just please try to think of a way. Just try. - Ink Chace, just think. - Knock knock. Thought you could use a cup of coffee. - Bless you. - Don't mention it. Are you alright? - I'm stuck Ilya. How do I tell her that there's no solution? That I'm gonna have to shut down the garden. - You're a smart man Chace. If you want it bad enough, you'll think of something. - I hope you're right. - It's so peaceful here at night. - It's peaceful here all the time. I can't believe tomorrow this will all be gone. - Honey, you can't think like that. - But it's over mom. I failed. Tomorrow Chace shuts this property down, soon construction will begin and dads dream will be but a distant memory. - But we'll always have the memory sweetie, if not the garden. - I know. It's just this place has become more than just memories for me. It was a way to bring people together, but it was also just this feeling, you know. For the whole neighborhood. It's home. Dad always said, "Look up, "there's a way over every obstacle." I just wish I was able to find my way over this one mom. I wish I could have figured it out. - Look up. There's a way over every obstacle. Look up. - Come on Chace. Don't let me down. - Hey Ilya, can you run this by engineering? - Hi Chace. Surprised to see me? - I have to say I am. What can I do for you? - I came here to thank you. - For what? - I've been hired by a New York design firm. - What? - And I wanted you to be the first to hear the news. You were the one who believed in me and gave me my big break. So if it weren't for you... - Congratulations. - Thank you. - That's great news. - I know. I saw you dancing at the gala. Was that Vikki George? - Yes. - You seem quite taken with her. - Well she's really opened my eyes to what's important. It's not just the buildings, it's the people inside them. Everyone around them, the entire community. - I'm happy for you. You looked perfect together. - I don't know if she feels the same. I did something that she may never forgive me for. - You're a good man Chace, and if she's as great as you think she is, she'll see that. - I don't know. - Well as you all know, Chace shut down the community Garden. But I just wanna ask you to sit tight. I am determined to come up with some sort of solution. The garden started off as my dad's dream, but it's really become mine. And I promise, I'm gonna find a way for us to start over. - I'm so sorry Vikki. We'll get the garden back. - I know. It just takes a little faith. - Call you later? - Yeah. Love you mom. - Love you too honey. - Vikki. - Mr. Boyle, Ms. Hewitt, it is the hardest to share this news with the two of you. I know how much the garden meant to you both, but I promise, I really am... - Hey hey, Vikki we have some news. - We're, well I guess we're dating. - Wait, what? - We're dating. Isn't it fantastic! - Yeah! Of course, but, how did this happen? - It was the day of the Garden Walk. Maybe it was the music and the dancing. - But we realized all our constant bickering may have been a result of some unresolved feelings between us. - Well this is amazing. - She's about tomatoes and I'm all about peppers. - Oh, I am so happy for you both. - Thank you Vikki. - But those weren't the only sparks we saw that day. - Yeah, we admit that you were burning pretty bright yourself as well. - We were hoping maybe you had some good news of your own. - Oh no, that's something that can never happen now. - Sure. Sometimes all it takes is to put your differences aside. - Not with the garden. There's been too much that's come between us for us to ever be together. Especially now. But I am so happy for the two of you. I really am. Oh it's wonderful. I tried so hard. - Vikki, Vikki! Just let me talk to you. - Chace. - Let me talk to you. - No, no, no, no, no. - I don't wanna talk to you. - I know you're still angry with me. - No, I know what you're gonna say. You're gonna say there was no solution and I get it. But I had just hoped beyond hope that you would think with your heart instead of your head and help me find a way to save my garden. - I couldn't save the site. There was too much money invested, too many jobs at stake. - No I understand. I really do. I'm just not ready to forgive you for it. Because for me, this was everything. This was my dream. And you crushed it Chace, you crushed it. Chace, look at it. There's nothing left. - I know, I know, but Vikki... - No butts Chace. - Vikki, just let me... - I saw you. - What? - I saw you with Marta. - When? - You were at your office and you were hugging her and I saw you Chace. - Vikki that was nothing. She got a job in New York, I was congratulating her. - Why should I believe anything you say? - Because I've always been honest with you. - It doesn't matter. It doesn't change anything. - Vikki. Take one more walk with me? Please, trust me. I promise I won't let you down. Almost there. - We're in your office building. - Just a little further. I just want you to know I made some changes to my business model. Changes inspired by you. I took a hard look at what's important. It's not just about succeeding to honor my mom, it's to honor her spirit as well. I wanted to put a piece of her in all of my buildings. A piece of my home. And Vikki, you're the one who made me realize what home means to me. So, I took your dad's advice. When faced with an obstacle, I looked up. This is for you. - You moved the garden. - I did. - It's all here. - I told you I would come up with a compromise if I could. But I think I came up with something even better. A rooftop community garden. And this won't be the only one. I'm converting every rooftop in every one of my buildings into garden spaces. And Vikki, I'm gonna need someone to run them all and I hope that someone will be you. - You moved every single plot, every single plant. You saved the garden. - Is that a yes? - Chace, you saved my dream. And you've given me a new one.
