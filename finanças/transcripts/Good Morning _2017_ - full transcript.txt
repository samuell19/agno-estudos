This one. Okay. But you can fix it, right? Of course. But I'm not gonna. You're gonna. -If I do... -I know, Dad. If you do it, I won't learn how. Yes. Mr. Hiro was hoping to get his generator by the end of the week. Do we want to start on that first? -Who? -Mr. Hiro. Who? Mr. Hiro. Nope. This one. I feel like the other two are fine for now, though. No, this one. That one... later. Okay. Hello? Good morning, Cate. This is Dr. Kinsella. Hi. Do you mind holding on a minute? No problem. Sorry to keep you waiting. How's he been doing? Okay days and bad days. His speech and comprehension seem slightly worse. His walking's way worse. I received his MRI results early and just had a cancellation for this morning. Can you both come in at 11 o'clock? If it were good news, you would've said so. How much has it grown? Approximately nine millimeters of left-to-right midline shift. Judging from his decline, probably not pseudoprogression? It's possible the Temodar is no longer having an effect. I just read about another case where Chloroquine was effective? Because there's not sufficient data, we're still not comfortable advocating its use. Well, what if he wanted to try it regardless? Would you write a prescription? We can talk about all this in person with your dad. Any idea how the traffic is today? My other patients have had no problem getting to the hospital on 146. Okay! We'll see you at 11. -Cate. -Yeah? I wish I had better news. Me, too. See you soon. You okay? Yeah, I'm good. The guy? Yeah, it was Dr. Kinsella. Come on, Dad. What? He wants us to go see him at 11. -Problem. -Yeah, I know. But there are still some things to try. Yeah? Yeah, but only if you want to. You were right. There's a real chance you could die fairly soon. But you could also last a lot longer given that you've already beaten the odds. The doctors keep saying how strong you are. It's true. What I'm hoping is that we get to ride the bikes together again. There's an anti-malaria drug that's been shrinking some tumors, but I don't think your doctors will prescribe it. I found someone who will. But we'd have to go to Baltimore. You know I'll support you in whatever choices you make. I just don't want you to be miserable. Two years of this has been a long time. Baltimore is far away. And there's no guarantee that anything else will work. But if you wanna keep fighting it, we'll keep fighting it. -Yep. -Yep, what? Try. -You wanna try another treatment? -Yep. Fight. Okay. You didn't go out, did you? You know you're not supposed to go out on your own. -Nope. -You didn't go out? No. Well, you said no gifts until this is over. Close it. Okay, Dad. Come on. You fixed Pup's 12 for me? Yep. Dad, this is killer. Thank you so much. I can't wait to use it. Yeah. We should get ready to go soon. I'll get the money. I have money. The money... over there. We have to get gas for your truck? That one. Okay, we can stop on the way. Yep, but... That one. You want me to get the paper before we go. Yep.
