- Once the lamb has hung out in the perforated holder for 10 hours, we wanna remove the meat from the bone. Keep the broth though. We're gonna need it in a sec. I swear on my daughter, mis amigos. In a stock pot, we want to combine the lamb, the roasted trumpet mushrooms, guajillo puree, and yes, just like I promised, that beautiful broth. Bring that to a simmer, and then season was sea salt and chili De arbol. Let that mixture cool, so it solidifies a bit. And then we're going to make little navidad presents one by one. We take our masa and some of our beautiful lamb sauce. And we wrap it up. And we put it in a pot to steam for about 20 to 30 minutes. They come out like this. I recommend a little crumbled queso fresco and some fresh cilantro. Delicioso. - Mm, and that is how you get my lamb tamale all over your face. Thanks for tuning in to another episode of Adela Romero's "Alta cocina." Until next time, adios. - And cut. And that's a season wrap. Great job, Adela. - Thank you. - You mind if we. All yours, all yours. - See you at the wrap party. Bye. - Adela wait. - Not now matius, Fabiola's soccer game is at six. Did you forget about your interview with the food writer? - No, can I take it in the car? - No, it's a video call. They're doing it for social media. - Tell them we'll reschedule. It's for your hometown paper. - Aren't you supposed to make my life easier? - Fabi! - Abuela, you're here. - I wouldn't miss your championship game and I'll use any excuse to see my nieta. - Where's mom? - Oh, she on her way. She just text me. Fabiola, come on. - I better get going. - Buena suerte. Hello, hello? - Hi. - Adela Romero. It's nice to see you. David agraponte, food reporter for the San Antonio telegram. - Hi David, it's nice to meet you. - We actually met a very long time ago. Anyway, I doubt you remember. It's a pleasure for me to speak with one of the San Antonio's most esteemed chefs. - Thank you. It's always a pleasure to speak with someone from my hometown. - Okay, so let's talk "Alta cocina." I hear you just wrapped another season. Congratulations. - Yes, and it's my favorite one yet. - So you began your career in the humble kitchens around San Antonio. Am I right? - Sounds like you've done your research. - But your dishes do little to honor the city's rich food traditions. Rather, as the name implies, "Alta cocina" is for the rich, wouldn't you agree? - Yes, I mean, wait, what? - You've become increasingly out of touch with your mainstream audience? 'Cause our recent episodes, you made bluefin tuna ceviche Kobe beef empanadas, truffle huevos rancheros. - Yes. - I'd have to fly overseas to get some of the ingredients. - Okay, so maybe not everyone can find Japanese beef at the supermarket. - You know, on your first serious "adelas kitchen," here in San Antonio, you featured simple, delicious recipes. Have you forgotten where you came from? - No, I haven't. The network comes up with a lot of the ideas, not me. - So you're saying that the recipes on the show aren't yours? - You didn't let me finish. - I'm sorry, go ahead. - Hey David, Matius Grossman here, Adela's manager, let's skip this one. Why don't you ask her about her favorite foods instead? - I can handle the questions matius. I stand behind what I make at "Alta cocina." Maybe the food isn't for the average home chef, but cooking fancy food has always made for good entertainment. - You were saying you consider yourself more of an entertainer than a chef. - Absolutely not. Cooking is my first love and it always will be. - Then why are you using network executive recipes instead of your own? - Okay, that's enough. Adela has another appointment. - All right, thank you for your time Adela. - Well, that went well. - My worst interview ever. - Adela, come on. - Who does he think he is? - Hey, don't listen to him. You're killing it out there. - Thank you. I gotta go. Come on. Go. - Go, go, go! Fabi. You won the game. - I had an assist Abuela. - Oh, and she's humble too. You're a star and I'm so proud of you. - Fabi, baby, I'm sorry. There was traffic. I got here as fast as I could, but hey you won. You worked so hard this season. - How would you know? Fabi. - You said you'd be here. - I tried. I really did, but it was work. - It's always work. - Let's celebrate, you, me, Abuela, your friends. You pick the place. I just wanna go home. I had a last minute interview after the show today. It was just awful. - That's too bad and why don't matius do anything? I don't know- - can I be excused? - I have some homemade ice cream from that new place in silver lake. - No thanks, I'm pretty tired. - Okay, goodnight. - Buenas noches. - Goodnight. - I'll have some of that ice cream. Sit down, I'll get it. - I'm blowing this single parenting thing. - No, you are not. You are doing the best you can. - Mauricio would have known what to do. - Mauricio loved you with all his heart. So do I. And so does fabi. You you are worrying too much Mija. - I'm not sure if fabi sees it that way. - Remember, she's a teenager now. I know, I know. The summer in San Antonio is just what you both need. - She's excited. - Y tu? - Honestly, going back without Mauricio, won't be easy. - I know, but trying to avoid your memories isn't easy either. It's been three years and as difficult as it is, life has to go on. - I'm excited to see the new renovations at Romero's. The pictures look great. - It was all my niece Sandra's idea. She thinks then you look will bring in your business. - Has it? - Mm-mm, not yet. - I'm sure it will. Hmm. Mm, this is really good. - Mm-hmm. - I can't believe we're spending the whole summer here. - I can't believe the humidity. - Oh, please. It's better than la. All of that nasty smog. - I wanna go to the Alamo and I wanna go to the river walk. Oh and I really wanna go to six flags. - Soccorro stop. - What is it? - It's tacos rapidos. - Yes, tacos rapidos. - Two carnitas tacos. Two king ala pollo tacos, two cokes, and for me three lengua tacos and a watermelon agua fresca. - That's exactly what I order. Oh no. - It's you, the food writer. - My name is David, actually. - You ambushed me. - I wouldn't say ambushed. I asked a few challenging questions. - Your questions sent me spiraling into an existential crisis. - That's why you're here at tacos rapidos. - Not exactly. - You know I'm surprised you wouldn't be caught dead at a place like this. - Clearly, you don't know me very well. - Ma'am, senorita. You're holding up the line. - Keep the change. As always, it was a pleasure. I'll have the exact same thing, man. - Who were you talking to mom? - No one. - You better get used to being recognized around here. - Ah, that was worth the trip. - Aqui esta, Romero's. - It looks amazing, Abuela. - I can't believe it. I love the colors. - Oh, it was all Sandra's idea. She says it brightens up the place. - Soccorro. You're back. - Fabi, do you remember your father's cousin, Sandra? Yeah, hi. Hi. - What's going on? It looks like you swallowed a habanero? - Manny quit. - What? Why? - Hi Sandra. - Hi. Who's Manny? - Aye, Manuel. He's our head cook. I thought you were handling things while I was gone. - Everything has been fine until now, I swear. - Until now. - Manny has been in a bad mood all morning. He says we don't pay him enough. - Could you afford to give him a small raise? - No and he knows that. What are we going to do? - I can cook while Manny blows off some steam. - Soccorro you haven't cooked in years. - It's like riding a bicicleta. Unless, Adela wants to. - Mom? - Her? - Me? - Ah, for old time's sake. We really need you? - What does she know about diner cooking? - Adela was the best cook Romero's ever had. - Yeah, like maybe years ago. - Do it mom, please. - Fine, for one night. It looks the very same as it did 15 years ago, back here. - We didn't have enough money to renovate the whole restaurant. - So you skimped on the kitchen? - So you'll pick up right where you left off. - These appliances are older than fabi. - Hijole, sorry it's not some fancy TV kitchen. - Esta bien, esta bien. - I can wash dishes. - Oh great. - I haven't moved this fast in a long time. Just like the old days. Order up! More lettuce and tomato. - How is it going in there? - Just like riding a bicicleta. Luckily it was a slow night. - Well, they are all pretty slow these days. - The customer wants to know what you put on these tacos? - It's micro Greens. - Adela, our customers aren't used to fancy food. - Micro cilantro, isn't fancy. It's a simple way to make the food tastes better. - Hmm. - Thanks for helping out today. It's nice having you back, girls. Come on, let's go. Honey, I'm home. Ruby. - Oh, miss you. I love you, I love you. Good girl. My neighbor comes and takes care of her when I'm gone. Beauty, I miss you. Mauricio's room. - Well, you can swap with fabi, if you want. - I'm fine. Thanks. - Towels are in the hall closet. Buenas noches. Night. Hey matius, it's late. Are you sitting down? - I was lying down until you called. - I just got off the phone with the executives as gourmand. And they're hiring you for a new series. - Really? - Yeah, their summer series, working with the world's best chefs. I'm listening. - You will be traveling to cities all around Europe - you're serious? - And the shooting schedule would not conflict with "Alta cocina." You're gonna have two shows in gourmand. This is huge. I'm in. - It's a 12 week shoot. They expect you in London in about 10 days. - Wait, you said a summer series, as in the summer? Yes. - Matius, you know what I'm supposed to spend the summer in San Antonio with my family. Fabi is gonna be devastated. - You know what a summer in Europe could do for her in the soccer field? She can play with the best of the best there. - You wanna explain that to fabi? She already thinks I'm the worst mom in the world. - She's a teenager, of course she thinks that. I can't accept the job without fabi being on board. - We'll talk to her. But the network needs an answer. Will you let me know by tomorrow? I really want you to have this. - Okay, I'll talk to her and I'll let you know. - Adela, que pasa? I was about to cook you breakfast. - I wanted to. Sit, sit. Not you Ruby. Morning, fabi. - Morning, morning. - Your favorites. Agua De jimaica, chilaquiles, huevos rancheros. - Why? - Just to celebrate the summer, Eat, eat. Mm. - So I have some big news. Last night I got a call from matius. And it turns out that the network wants me to host another TV show. - Ah, congratulations. - Oh, good job mom. - I'd be working with chefs from all over the world and we get to spend the summer in Europe. - Europe? But you said we'd spend the whole summer here. - I know baby, but this is a major opportunity for me. For both of us. You could go to soccer camp in Europe. Wouldn't that be cool? Fabi, wait. I know this isn't how we plan to spend our summer, but it's what I do. It's work. - It's always work. You never stop working. We've been planning this trip for a whole year. We haven't been here since, since dad died. - I didn't give matius an answer. I want us to make this decision together. - Okay then, I don't wanna go. I wanna stay here. - But you could see the world. - I don't wanna go. - At your age, all I ever wanted to do was get out of San Antonio. - Not me. - Where are you going? - To the park. I don't need to go to Europe to play soccer. - Let me guess. She doesn't want to go. - She'll come around. I don't have to leave for Europe for another 10 days. - Adela, what if you turned a job down? - Not you too. - Aye, nevermind. I'm sure you know what's best. - This is a big opportunity, soccorro. My own international cooking show. I could be the Latina, Anthony Bourdain. - Well, good luck changing Fabi's mind. She's just as stubborn as both of us. - Did you hear from Manny? - Oh he said he's not coming back. - What are you gonna do? - We're closed today, but I need to find someone quick. - I'll fill in again. - No, no, I can't ask you to do that. You're on vacation. - It was kind of nice being back there. - Hmm, a few more days in San Antonio, and you'll forget all about Europe. I'm going grocery shopping if you and fabi want to join me? - Okay, but can we change it up a bit? - Change what up? - Let's buy local. - Nope. - I'm sure there's a farmer's market nearby. I can't afford to buy there. - I'll buy the groceries this week. - Out of the question. - I just wanna show you the difference fresh ingredients make. You said the business wasn't doing well and the renovations weren't working, maybe better food will. Just try it. - Hmm, fine. We'll try it. But just because they are more expensive, doesn't mean they are better, okay? ♪ Oh, oh ♪ ♪ yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah mm, mm ♪ ♪ sunny days, bringing in a little bit of summer love ♪ ♪ got me ♪ - It's amazing, isn't it? ♪ And I can't stop smiling ♪ ♪ I don't know ♪ - Don't you notice a difference? - Eat it. - Not before washing Nina. - Okay. - Try this.

I'm a regular. - You? Don't get me wrong. I love it, but it's not fancy food. - Stop in for Romero's famous elote once a week. - Interesting. - You thought I was pretentious didn't you? - Actually, I haven't thought about you at all. So do you have any recommendations while I'm here? I wanna know where not to go. - Yeah, my friend, Julio, agua fresca stand. I recommend you go there. - Perfect, I won't. - Especially when you consider how mild the summer weather is here. Nothing like not having a cold, refreshing agua De melon right about now. - I'm really starting to hate you. Okay? I want one. - You won't regret it and Julio, he's one of your biggest fans. I don't know why really? Just kidding. Hey Julio, look who I found. - Adela Romero. Dios mio. I thought David was joking when he said he saw you yesterday. What are you doing here in San Antonio? - Visiting my family. - I can't believe you're here with David after the way he went after you in that interview. - Oh, I'm not with him. You saw the video. - Me and the rest of San Antonio. - Fantastico! Come on, it wasn't that bad. - It got a little heated. It was a good interview. - For you. - An agua De melon will make all your troubles go away, I promise. I source food from my sister's husband. He owns an organic farm outside the city. - Wow. That's perfect. The flavors are so bright. - David pinch me. I just got, ow! - How much? - It's my treat. Consider it an apology. - I have to get going. It was nice to meet you, Julio. - The pleasure was all mine. - See you around. You think that was a yes? - No. - Tell me what you think? - Stop looking at me like that. It's better, okay. But I can't afford to shop at the farmer's market every week. - What if move things around with the budget? - Mm-mm, there is nothing to move. I've actually been thinking of selling. - What? - What? - This was our dream. To open a restaurant in America to have a legacy for our family. But I'm too old to breathe new life into this place. And there are realtors willing to pay a nice price for the property. - Romero's is more than just a property. Mauricio and I met here. Fabi grew up here. - You can't sell it Abuela. - With business so bad, it's too much of a burden. - I can do more than just help you in the kitchen. What if I help you reinvent the menu, update it? Romero's has been making the same thing for the past 30 years. It might be time. - I don't know Adela. - She's right Abuela. - Well, I guess things can't get any worse. - That's the spirit. - Try this Sandra. - But I need the burrito. - Try it Sandra. - What is this? Lamb? - What do you think? - It's good, but this Romero's. We can't serve lamb, and I still need the burrito. - Yeah, yeah. - Romero's is for working class, not fancy Mija. - Can you meet me half way? - Lamb isn't halfway. - It's expensive. - I appreciate your feedback. Here's your burrito. - Thanks Patrick. - Back at you Sandra. Socorro, hey, how are you? - Oh if it isn't my favorite work neighbor. I haven't seen you for a while. You must be too busy pumping iron. - Actually, the gym's been busy lately. My son finished up with the army, so I'm getting him settled in there. I'm handing over the keys to him soon. - No what, you're retiring? - Yep, I've got some good years left. And with Patrick Jr. home, it seems like the right time to call it quits. - Retirement, what I wouldn't give for a little rest and relaxation. You ever consider hanging up your apron? - Just everyday. But I think I'll run Romero's 'til I drop dread if we're lucky enough to say in business. - Well I'll certainly do my best to keep the lights on. You'll probably be seeing a lot more of me once I retire. - Looking forward to it. - See you later, ladies. Bye Patrick. - Bye. Hey guys. Hi David. - David, how are you? Come for elote? - You know me too well, but I was hoping you could help me find an ex cook of yours. - Oh you mean Adela? Adela, com out here a second please. - She's here? - Si, she's working for me. - Oh, okay. Adela? - You were supposed to call me yesterday with an answer. The network is breathing down my neck. - I know matius, I'm sorry. But fabi doesn't wanna leave San Antonio. - Oh, you can't pass on this massive opportunity. - She blew up at me when I tried to pitch her a summer in Europe, which is why I need more time. - You know what, we doing the hard to get thing may actually work in our favor when we negotiate your contract. - If we negotiate the contract. It's up to fabi. - She's gonna love Europe. I guarantee it. Just tell her about all the cute boys on vespas. - Fabi isn't riding a vesper, especially not with a boy. - Mom? Abuela says you have a visitor. - You know I thought you TV chefs made the big bucks. - What are you doing here? - Nice to see you too. Is David the dude you keep running into? Why you didn't say something? David is practically family. - Wait, you two know each other? - Adela, don't you remember David? He worked here back when you did. What? - I was a line cook one summer. Like I said in our interview, I doubt you remember me. - Interview? - I'll show you the video later. - It's coming back to me. You're Davey. Your hair was longer. And your face was- - I know, luckily I grew out of both those things. Thanks though. - You used to be so sweet and quiet. You grew out of that too. So Davey, what is it that you wanted besides elote? - Well, well, I was hoping I could profile you for the telegram. The interview got a ton of play online, and when I mentioned bumping into you, my editor was interested in a follow-up piece. - Tell your editor, the answer is a big fat no. - Adela, don't be so rude. - He trashed "Alta cocina." Do you have any idea how hard I had to work to get that show? - This could be a great chance to explain yourself in your own words. - She'll do it. - Fabi. - And who's this? - She's my daughter, fabiola. - Mom, do the interview. It's free press for Romero's. - She has a point. I like her. - You stay out of this. - How did you get so smart? - Fine, when? - Tomorrow. River walk, 3:00 pm. - It's a date. You know what I mean? I'll be there. - Great, I look forward to it. - Oh. - Were you born in San Antonio? - Why are you asking me things things you already know? - Humor me. - San Antonio, born and raised. - How did you get into cooking? - My mom left when I was young, so I started helping my dad with cooking. He died from cancer my last year of high school. Raul Romero, the original owner of Romero's, hired me as a line cook. That was my culinary school and so much more. - What do you mean so much more? - Everything good in my life has come from Romero's. I worked there for almost 10 years. It's where I fell in love with my husband Mauricio. Raul and Socorro his wife, became my family. It was because of our success there that I started doing segments for "San Antonio in the morning." Then the local show, then "Alta cocina." - Okay, so what's happening at Romano's now? Are you just pitching in while you're at home or is it more? - I'm working on a new menu. The old favorites, but with some new twists, not to mention better ingredients. - So how about a sneak peek of any of your new dishes? - Not just yet. I'm still in the experimentation phase, but don't write that. - No, I'll write something like she was coy with her response. - Cool, that's good. A lot better than she has no clue. - Can you talk to me about the food a little bit? I'm sure you've kicked around a few ideas. - I wanna show San Antonio what I've learned in la the last five years, but keep the little price point. Romero's been around for three decades, but I wanna make the city see us with new eyes, to fall in love all over again. - Yeah, I think that's all I need. - When will you run the story? - Probably next few days. Do you think the new menu will be ready by then? - It's not impossible. - I have a good feeling. - A good feeling, huh? Coming from the guy who said I was out of touch. - Yeah, I know, I know. Sorry about that. - What makes you such an expert anyway? Have you worked anywhere besides Romero's? - Well you know what Romero's was my first and only experience in the restaurant business. It's watching you command that kitchen made me realize I just didn't have it in me to be a chef. I'm a lot better at eating food and cooking. I wrote for food and wine magazines right after school. But then one fall I came home just to visit my parents and found myself more inspired by the food scene here. And as long as I’m being honest here, I have a confession to make. I was a big fan of your first show, "Adela's kitchen." I saw every episode. - Really? Tell me more. - The food you made was simple and tasty with a lot of local influence. As a matter of fact, I was able to make it at home without totally messing up. Also. - Also? - Also, I always had a big crush on you going back to my Romero's days, so yeah, there's that. - Oh, well that's, I gotta go. - I'm so sorry. - Oh no, it's my fault. - It's okay. - Here I have a napkin. - Ah, this is great, thank you. - All right. - No, it's okay, don't worry. - Way to go Todd. - Here, allow me. You have ice cream on your nose. I'm sorry Adela, I shouldn't have said that. - No, you're fine. - Now I'm in the mood for ice cream. How about you? - Always. - Okay. - If this doesn't take care of your false ideas about me, I don't know what will. - Your right. Your much more down to earth than what I thought. - Down to earth, is that good? - Yeah. Yeah I think so. I have a reading this weekend. My first book is being published. It's about the history of Tex-mex cooking. - Davey has a book out. Wow. - Yeah well, I am not the best public speaker. Actually it sort of terrifies me. But anyways, afterwards there's gonna be a little party. Great food, good music. It's gonna be fun. You should come. - I have to see what's going on at Romero's, but maybe. - Cool, maybe. - You mind? Nice kick. - Thanks but you know you're not supposed to use your hands, right? - I'm the goalie. - Oh then, nice catch. I saw you play the other day. You're pretty good. - Thanks. - You can play with us sometime if you want. - Yeah, maybe. - Hey Brandon! - Hey Brandon! Hey Brandon, get back here. - I better. - Later. Come on Brandon. Fabi, hey. - What do you want? Are you gonna try and convince me to go to Europe again? - No, but I wish you'd be more open-minded. - Why do I have to be open-minded? Why don't you? - I'm gonna go home and work on some new recipes for the menu. Walk with me? - Dinner time. - Soccorro, I thought you'd be at Romero's. - Oh, the dinner rush is over, so I turned things over to Sandra and to the prep cook for the night. I want to hear all about the interview. - It was nice. Did you do know that David wrote for food and wine magazines in New York before the telegram? - Yes, and? - He invited me to a book reading. He wrote a book. Did you know that? - Oh Mija, that interview sounds more like a date. - Que, no, I just- - I just want to know if he's gonna write something nice about Romero's. We need the press. - I told him as many nice things as I could. Davey, I mean, David said the article will probably run in a few days. - So, are you go to his reading? What? He's reading? You said he invited you to his reading. - Oh, I don't know. I'm gonna be busy at Romero's. - Awe, come on. I'm not that old, and you're not busy. - Is Ruby eating my lamb tamales? - I she? - Chicharon nachos, jackfruit tacos, Kale and artichoke guacamole and pork belly tamales. All twists and Ramiro's favorites and all possible within our budget. - Pork belly tamales. It looks really good. - Well? What do you think? - It's really good. - You don't see me giving it to Ruby, uh-uh. - Oh, Patrick back so soon. - I read that telegram article like everyone else in here apparently. - I had it framed. - You're something else soccorro. - Well, thanks to Adela. - Adela? It's you who's been keeping this place going all these years. So you think Adela is gonna take over and let you retire? - Why are you so interested in my retirement? - Well, I just thought maybe if you had more free time, you and I could get together outside of work, I mean. - I don't need to retire for that. So what it's going to be? Bean burrito? - Actually I want to try the especiales De Adela. - Which one? - All of 'em. - Okay, I'll get it for you. One takeout order with all the specials. - Can you believe all these customers? - The article came out yesterday, let's just wait and see how that line looks next week. - I know, I know. Still it's exciting. Isn't it? People really like the new dishes. - I don't like how much you're spending on groceries. If this plan doesn't pan out, we're gonna have a big problem. - Thank you. - Oh David, look who's here? - Get him all the specials. From now on, David eats on the house. - Oh, thanks soccorro, but I'm pretty sure that would violate my journalistic integrity. - Mm, suit yourself. - I do wanna try the especiales, but I'm paying. - What about your beloved elote? - Well obviously I’m getting that too. - You must have a lot of fans David. There must have been half of San Antonio here in the past two days. - They're your fans? I just wrote the article. So I was wondering, you know my reading is in a couple of days. - The reading, right? I don't know. It's very hectic here. - It'll only be an hour or so. Most of my friends are chefs, so it's gonna be in the mid-afternoon that's between lunch and dinner. - That's helpful. - It's my first book reading. I hate public speaking. I'm really, I'm really nervous. - Just act confident whether you're feeling it or not. - All right, yeah, I'll keep that in mind. - I can't make any promises. Romero's is my top priority right now. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, say no more. It's okay. - This is on the house. I won't tell anyone. - Journalistic integrity, remember? I do want to try a bite though. Oh man. - As good as the elote? - Even better. Take care Adela. - You too David. - Adela, I was thinking what about a little celebration tonight in honor of all the success? - I'd say that Sandra was right earlier. We probably shouldn't count our tamales before they cook. - Oh stop, I never burned a tamale in my life, and besides that if we're just the flavor of the week, it doesn't mean it's not worth a fiesta. - Sandra, fabi, we're celebrating tonight at my house. - I'm game. - I'm in. - Adela? - Let's do it, orale. Matius, hey. - Hey, hey? I don't hear from you in days, and all I get is a, "hey?" - I've been busy. The network is tired of waiting. They need an answer. - I don't have one. - Do you know how many people would kill for the position you're in right now? - I know and I wanna say yes, but family comes first. Adela are you coming? - I gotta go, bye. Oh-oh, she's fighting paper, secretary! No, no, she's scratching records, DJ. - Wait, are you swimming? It's swimming. - The word was chef. I was cooking. - No, that was not cooking. You should spend more time in the kitchen, Sandra. Okay, who's next? - Mom, you're next? - Okay, I hope you're better than Sandra. - I don't remember the last time we did this together. - Um. - At the going away party. - Oh, yes. - Before, before we moved to la. Dad loved charades. - He should be the one with a career in Hollywood. - I wouldn't argue with that. - I do remember you being pretty bad. - Yeah, she was. No, but, but dad always knew what you were acting out. It's like they, it's like they had psychic connection. Ooh, ooh. - That was a really fun party. - Yeah. - Okay. This is a tough one. - Oh, she always says that. - Okay. - Okay, set the timer. - And, go. - Dolphin, dolphin. She's a dolphin. - Wave. - Swim. - Mermaid, swim. - No, no. - Riding a wave. - I know, okay ladies. Thank you guys for a great night. I'll see you early manana. - Okay. - Good night. - Well, I'm going to bed. - Okay. Night, night. - Night. - She's a sweet girl. Yeah, she is. - Listen, I overheard you today in the kitchen talking with David why don't you go to his reading? - Because we're too busy. - We'll figure out a way to cover you. David did us a big favor. And besides that, he's a really nice guy. And you like him. - No, I don't. - Adela, life has to go on. You can not live in pain. - I don't. - I know you miss my son. So do I, but you can't give up a love. I want you to be happy and Mauricio would too. - I don't know if I'm ready to move on. I gotta get some sleep. Claro. - Goodnight Ruby. - Buenas noches. - Nice crowd isn't it? - Yeah, have you tried this? Oh I love them. - This is your day Davey. You excited? - Yeah, I guess. There's more people here than I expected. - Hey, how often does your buddy write a book? The food community supports you. You've been a champion for us. We're here to return the favor. - Yeah, I appreciate it. I'm just used to writing not speaking. - You'll be fine. - Thanks. - Hi, welcome, welcome everyone. Well I think ya'll know I'm a lot more comfortable behind a laptop than in front of you all, or even better, behind the plate at a local restaurant. Seriously, I'm honored to see so many friends from San Antonio's food community here today. I'm such a fan of yours and it means the world that you're here. I wanna share something, a little bit. Beginning in the 16th century, the territories now defined as Texas and Mexico we're both part of one large Spanish colony. The colony in 1821, when the first Mexican Thank you. I'm surprised you made it. - I talked to the boss. - I'm glad you're here. - You were great. I don't know why you were so nervous. How much? - How about you just plug me on "Alta cocina" some time. - How about you come on and plug it yourself? - I don't think I'm quite ready for TV yet, no. If you so. - Adela, hey. - Hey, Julio. - Adela Romero remembered my name? I think I'm gonna faint. - You guys, meet Adela. Adela, this is Bart. He owns a modern Peruvian restaurant in downtown. Helen manages the best mezcal bar in San Antonio and you Julio obviously already met. - I adore "Alta cocina." - Oh, thanks. - I'm loving the new pork belly tamale at Romero's. - Everyone's talking to it. - You can really taste the heart of your new dishes. It's great to see you bring new life to that place. - Not to give every cook in town some more competition. - Ah, that too. - You guys have a really supportive food scene here. I'm glad to get reacquainted. It's so nice to see you all come together for David. - Well, normally I never trust a critic, but David's one of the good ones. - I'm finding that out. Let's go to the bar. I brought in some great mezcal. - Actually, I can't stay. My daughter's playing soccer with a pickup team tonight and I wanna watch their game. - That sounds like fun. - I'd invite you, but you have your party. - Yeah, they can go on without me. I'd rather go out with you and watch some soccer. - Okay. - Go fabi. - Hey guys. - Hey. - Hope we're not too late. - Oh no. We just got here. Romero's was a zoo again. All thanks to David. - Yeah, I'm gonna have to review those especiales soon. Everyone's buzzing about the new tamale. - Yeah, for now. - What do you mean? - Adela is doing a great job in the kitchen. But once she leaves, the customers might too. - Aye Sandra, don't be so negative. Adela set us up for success. - I really hope you're right. - Look fabi has a breakaway. Vamos fabi, let's go. Fabi go. - Go fabi. - You have a very talented daughter. - I know. Good job fabi. - Ah way to go! Bye fabi. - Bye. - You did awesome, baby. - Thank you. - You remember Davey? I mean, David, sorry. - It's okay. It was an honor watching you play. You're like a young Alex Morgan. - You know Alex Morgan? She's my favorite player. - I'll tell you a secret. I love soccer almost as much as I love food. - We'd better head home for dinner. You must be starving fabi. - Okay, let's go. - Later. - Bye. - Later. Thanks for inviting me tonight. - Thanks for ditching your party for a middle school soccer game. - Well I had fun. - Same here. - Well good night. - Night. - Good night girls. - Bye. - Bye. - So, did he kiss you? - Soccorro, it's not like that. He wanted to watch soccer. - Are you sure that's all mom? - Mm-hmm. - Adela. - Matius, what are you doing here? - Hey, fabi. - Hey. - This is my matius, my manager. And this is Socorro. - Nice to meet you. - You too, fabi and I are going to start dinner okay? - You wont answer my calls? - You have to stop pressuring me. - We ran out of time with the network. - I wanna go to Europe, but they need me here. I'm helping out at Romero's. - Romero's. Are you working at that crummy old diner again? - It's not crummy. Adela, you have the chance to make TV with the world's greatest chefs, gain international recognition. But here you are squandering away your time at that glorified taco bell. - I told you my family comes first and fabi doesn't wanna go. - Well, I need an answer by tomorrow. It's either Europe or San Antonio. It's up to you. - Hey guys, we need to have a family meeting after work. - What did we decide? - I told you I'm not making any decisions without you. I just want the three of us to talk. - Sure Mija. - Soccorro. Soccorro. - Sorry, what were you saying? - You need to review these resumes. I placed an ad out since Manny quit. I went through all the applications and this is my shortlist. - Adela might stay. - She's not gonna give up her TV show to work in our kitchen. - You didn't know that. - Neither do you. We need to keep looking for someone. - All right, all right. - Hey. - Patrick, we don't open 'til 11:00. - I wanted one of those pork belly tamales for breakfast. I haven't been able to stop thinking about 'em. - Sorry amigo, no can do. - You don't seem like a chipper old self today. Is everything okay? - It's nothing, I'm fine. - Having fabiola and Adela back has been great. Adela has turned this whole place around, but now she got an offer where she can travel the world. How does Romero's compete with that? - Maybe you don't try and compete. I mean it sounds like a great opportunity for Adela. Maybe the best thing you can do is just be supportive. - I want to. I really do, but I'm not sure her heart's in it. She belongs here in San Antonio. - Are you sure it's her heart and not yours? - Ever since my son died, she's been running. It hurts too much for her to be here without Mauricio, but I know he'd want her to be here with us, with family. - I'm sorry, soccorro. I know how much you care about Adela. Sometimes we have to let our kids figure things out on their own. But you know what? I have a good feeling about Adela. - You're right. Thanks Patrick. - Of course. - You want that pork belly tamale? We're about to open. I'm sure I can get Adela to make you one. Come on. Actually, I didn't really come for a tamale. About what we discussed the other day, about getting together outside of Romero's. - Oh, aye dios. Adela, can I talk to you? - I'm not quite finished yet. - It'll just take a minute, por favor. - Que Paso? - How would you like to take over Romero's? - Excuse me? - I can't run this place forever and I don't wanna sell it. I want you to have it, and that's what Mauricio would want too. - Soccorro, I'm honored. Really? Thank you. But I don't know what to say. I have my career to think about. - I know, I know, and it's up to you. But you are the only person I trust with Romero's. - Well, what about Sandra? She's learning the business and she works so hard. - Sandra isn't ready, and she might never be. - I cannot believe this. Your giving Romero's to Adela after a week? - Adela worked here over 10 years. It's just that she's older. She has more experience. - She works in a TV show. She doesn't know how to run a business. - Hang on. I never said I wanted to take over Romero's. - Why? My dream job isn't good enough for you. - Sandra, where is this coming from? - I know Adela walks on water, and I'm just very lowly assistant manager. You're making a big mistake. The only reason Adela is even helping us is because she feels guilty for leaving. And deep down, she knows sooner or later, she's gonna leave again. - That's not true. - Keep telling yourself that. - Sandra, Sandra, Sandra, wait. - Well, if it isn't the best tamale maker in town. Hi David. - We're busy. - I promise I'm not trying to cut the line. - I think mom would be okay with that. - An order of nachos with Chicharon, rapido. - I'll make this fast. Are you free for dinner tomorrow? I thought you might like to check out my friend Bart's restaurant. You know that Peruvian place. He put this new of on the menu that's out of this world. You would love it. - Yeah, David. I don't know. - David, what? No, Davey? We can talk later. This was bad timing on my part. - No, I mean, I don't know if I'll be around tomorrow. It was a fun week, but I really don't belong here anymore. - I think you belong beautifully here. - You barely know me beyond a couple of interviews. - I'm trying to change that. - Gourmand wants me to host a summer series in Europe. Cooking with Monica galetti, masimo boturra, and I'm here at breaking my back at the grill. I've come so far to do this all over again. - I thought Romero's was important to you? - It is important. That doesn't mean I have to work here the rest of my life. It's time to move on. - What's going on? Talk to me of Adela. - Interview is over David. Order up. - Yeah if you say so. Bye. Bye soccorro. - I don't think we had a crowd like that since the good old days. - Yeah, I need to talk to you about those good old days. - Si Mija. - Fabi can you come out here? It's family meeting time. I thought about your offer. I can't do it. Romero's is my past. It's not my future. I'm taking the job in Europe. - Mom, no. - I can't stay here. Sandra was right. I came just because I felt guilty. It was me who took Mauricio away from the place that he loved, so I could have my show. I don't deserve Romero's. - You promised you wouldn't make a decision without me. - I know. And I don't want to ruin your summer, but I bet Abuela wouldn't mind if you stayed with her for awhile. We'll go back to California before school starts. - But this is home. Not anymore. - Adela, you know I’d love to have fabi, but you should be the one looking after your daughter. And I hope you'll change your mind. - I won't. - You can't do this mom. I don't want you to go. - I have to fabi. You'll understand one day. I called matius to make arrangements with the network. - Adios, Mija. - I love you both. Good luck Sandra. - Where is she going? - Europe. - Really? Fabi, what's wrong? - What's wrong is her mother is leaving, because of your jealousy. If you hadn't said all those hurtful things. - You always side with her. - All my mom has been is nice to you. She's saved Romero's, why would you say all those mean things to her? - Because we don't need some famous TV chef fixing our problems. If you would just listen to me. - I did listen to you. I invested all I had into these renovations, and they didn't work. I'm sorry if you feel like I've taken you for granted. But you're still young and you're still have a lot more to learn. - I'm sorry too. Fabi wait. - Fabi. - To get my mom back. - Fabi, I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have opened my big mouth. - Yeah sorry won't help now. - Maybe not, but it won't hurt to try. Come on. - Okay hold on. I can't run the counter and cook and who's gonna wash the dishes? I'll figure it out. - Gracias, soccorro. - Patrick, do you know how to wash dishes? - Sure, absolutely. - Okay, come on. - I'm so glad you came to your senses. - Me too. - So what's with the long face? You're gonna be an international cooking star, right up there with Jamie Oliver and Julia child, like you always wanted. - Yeah. Do you mind if you make a quick taco stop? - We can't miss this flight. - It'll just be a sec. - One second, literally. - Adela. - Sandra, fabi, what are you doing here? How did you find me? - You always stop at taco rapidos, dad's favorite restaurant when we get to town and before we leave. - You can't leave Adela. It's for the best. - I shouldn't have said all those things to you. I'm sorry. - It's all true. I came back because I felt guilty for leaving San Antonio, for losing Mauricio. - Mom, dad died because he had a bad heart. - But he should've been here surrounded by his family. And that was my fault. - It's not your fault, mom. - Fabi's right. - And I was rude to you because I'm jealous. And not because you were so Hollywood chef, but because it's you that belongs at Romero's. You know the place inside and out. I mean you turned the place around in a week. I couldn't do that. And I hate to admit that. - Sandra, I appreciate your words, but- - mom just stop. You wanna know the real reason why I wanted to move back to San Antonio. It wasn't about the city. It was about you. I missed you, the person you were before la. The happy mom who was always busy, but always made time to go to her daughter's soccer games or to cook her favorite foods or to talk, to just hang out, this week you've been that and I don't wanna lose you. Not again. So please mom, don't go. - Thought you said you would only be a second? We need to go now if you're gonna catch that flight. - Give me one more second. - Thought you made up your mind? - I had. - This is your last chance with the show. If you miss that flight, we're not only gonna lose the new show. We might end up losing "Alta cocina." - I don't care. - What did you say? - I said, I don't care. I'm staying in San Antonio for good. - Are you out of your mind? You will never work in Hollywood again. - I guess I don't need a manager. You're fired. - You'll be sorry. Welcome back, mom. - Thank you baby. - Senorita, ma'am, you're holding up my line. - Actually, we should have back to Romero's or soccorro will have to handle the dinner rush alone. - Hey, can you drop me off on the way? - Where? - I owe someone an apology? - Any more tacos? Who got taco rapidos? - Me. - I thought you were leaving town? - You want a taco? - Lengua? - Of course. - Y agua fresca De sandia? - It's in the bag. I'm sorry about the way I acted at Romero's. I had a lot of stuff going on. I never expected to meet someone like you while I was here. - What do you mean like me? - It's been hard getting over losing my husband. And before I met you, the thought of being with someone else, was unthinkable. The truth is David, I like you. I might even love you, so I thought you should know I'm moving back to San Antonio if you ever want to ask me out again. - Wait, did you just say you loved me? - I said I might. - You can't take it back now. - I love you too. - Let them steam for an hour. Once you take your tamales out of the pot, you wanna let them cool. Then add some pork belly, spread the sauce, and garnish with some queso fresco, and pickled onions. Your pork belly tamales are ready for your belly. Thank for watching "Romero's cocina." Until next time, adios. - Cut, that's a wrap. Great stuff Adela. Your web series is so much more accessible than "Alta cocina." I can actually cook this stuff. - That's the point. Now if we're done for today. It's time to do my real job. - Have a great weekend. - Hey, Adela? - What's up boss? - Will you stop calling me that? I'm just the new manager in training. - Close enough. - I wanted to go over the new additions to the menu. - Let me guess, too expensive. Yes, but I have a lead on a new organic farmer who's actually, he can help with with the new produce prices. Apparently the guy's addicted to our Chicharon nachos. Sandra. - We have to get to the bank meeting. I want them to know that your face down there. Ready? - I'm ready. Okay, Adela, what time your party tonight? - Seven o'clock. - Gosh, I'm so excited. I can't wait. - I wandered in here almost 20 years ago as a young girl looking for a job. But I never knew that this is where I would find my family. Socorro, thank you for welcoming me in back then, and for believing in me. I wish nothing but the best for you in the years to come. Happy retirement! Happy retirement, soccorro. Salud. - Cheers. - Salud. - Salud. - Cheers. - Thank you, you all for your well wishes. I'm truly blessed by all of you to be here tonight. Salud.
