"Be responsible for fire!" "Be responsible for fire!" "Be responsible for fire!" "Extinguish all flames!" "Be responsible for fire...!" "Be responsible for fire!" "Extinguish all flames!" Say it! Stubborn woman! Say it! Say it! Please! Stop it! You're my maid. Why help Ochika's slave? A slave is a slave. You have to die! I'm an officer! You've mistaken me for somebody else! "KILLED BY NEMURI KYOSHIRO." No...! Please, no... Please don't..! Stop it! Please...!!! Please don't... I beg you, please stop... Please, no... Please don't... "RAPED BY NEMURI KYOSHIRO." If it's vengeance you want, I need your explanation. I'm Kamio Seijuro's daughter, Shino! Prepare for my father's revenge! Kamio Seijuro? I've never heard his name before. Quiet! You're being a coward! Perhaps, I should have paid more attention to the men that I've killed. Please tell me when and where I killed him. The seventh of this month, behind Yanaka Tenno-ji Temple. There was a note saying "Killed by Nemuri Kyoshiro"! I won't accept your "no"! I've never killed anyone who did not attack me first. - Be ready! - Get him! My intention is only for you to realize that you're a woman. Women have their own way to live in the world with femininity. Forget about revenge and find your happiness. Dear... What is it? Please tell me. Why are you silent? People say that Nemuri Kyoshiro... has gone insane for blood and women. There's nothing wrong with a second Nemuri Kyoshiro being in the world. I knew it, it was an imposter. I'm so happy! But why does he pose as you, and do cruel things to people? Don't know. Don't want to, either. But, he's obviously trying to frame you. I'm very used to it. Don't be so stubborn. I'm quite worried about it! "ABORTION CLINIC" Well, it's so sad... There goes another baby to be secretly killed. I heard these days that abortion clinics are very busy. What a depressing world we live in! So we do... The clinic is making money terminating babies nobody wants. This inn makes money offering a place for couples to have clandestine affairs. They make a great combination... Don't they? Please... That sounds so terrible! - Madam! Trouble! - What? Please let me die! Let me die... She's a prostitute and he's the son of a poor samurai family. - Of course they can't get married. - It's a typical story. They should have let them die! The rich use the abortion clinic like it's nothing. The poor, on the other hand, tragically end up like this. That's not right! I've no acquaintances among the Shogun's spies. Chizuru? Well, I don't know. What happened to Chizuru? She's been missing since a few days ago. We can't find her no matter how we look. Might you know something about her? How can I know about her when I don't even know her name? Perhaps you think... I, Nishikinokoji, should know what happened to her? No, that's not what I'm saying. But I heard that Ikuno-dono took her somewhere. Ikuno? Do you know anything about this? No, not at all. I'd like to talk to the person who is saying these things. My lady, I think I made a mistake. If you're trying to gain power since you're carrying the Shogun's child... We have Tamaki who is already pregnant. It all depends on your answer. Now we'll resolve this serious matter. What do you say? It was my fault. In the future, be careful when you speak to me. Please forgive me, my lady. I didn't know I was being watched. It's alright. There's no proof that it was you. However, Ochika's belly is so obvious these days. Yes, according to the castle's doctor, she's in the fifth month of pregnancy. The fifth month! - Tamaki, you're in the 4th month? - Yes. I wish it were the opposite. Having a boy is what matters, not who delivers the first baby. To be the next Shogun, the baby must be a boy. Chizuru! What a painful end you had! I could not find the evidence... Please forgive me! I must have a boy! Then I will teach Nishikinokoji-sama a lesson! Takiyama, I'm really counting on you. Please take care of me well. Of course, my lady. From the bottom of my heart. Sayo-dono requests to see Chizuru. - What? Sayo? - No! She's one of Nishinokoji-sama's maids! Aren't you ashamed to come here? Brother! Please excuse me... CHIZURU'S GRAVE MARKER Wait! I want to hear about the other Nemuri Kyoshiro. By masquerading as me, and committing murders... What was your brother's purpose? Even if I'm a villain, I can't stand to see innocent people killed! You can't say you don't know. He will be punished, by God... His punishment will be meted out by God! I don't have any reason to be the target of Iga ninja. Please forgive me. Because of your work, our wishes will soon come true. If the day comes, will you please grant my request? Of course, if everything goes well, I guarantee not only your life, but the lives of the 58 other secret Christians. Yes. Ometsuke, Itakura Dogen-dono, is also understanding on this matter. I'm quite sure. What about the boat to Luzon Island? I have already arranged with the merchant Oranda-ya. Is it all true? Do you think that I'm telling you a lie? I'll never forget about thirteen years ago. It's over. I feel so sorry for you. That's why I listen to you and try to help your secret Christians escape. If I didn't work at the O'oku, you may not have become a Christian. Don't overestimate yourself! Shuma, now that you're a mature man, don't you miss a woman's flesh? Right in here. After that, dinner will be waiting for you in another room. Please stop inside. You're one of the highest ranking women of the O'oku, yet, even you became weak while seeing your true love. Well... It's an old story. What is your urgent matter? The rumors about Nemuri Kyoshiro have gotten out of control. The real Nemuri won't be quiet anymore. We'll get hurt if we don't play it right. Our purpose from the beginning was to upset him, it seems like we've gotten into trouble. What about the plan to use Iga ninja to attack him? We've tried many times, but he's not easy to kill. Now, I regret... having given Shuma permission to masquerade as Kyoshiro. Since you're an Ometsuke, you should be preparing for the next move, rather than regretting what you've already done! Ochika isn't due for 5 months. There's nothing to worry about unless she delivers a boy. However, it has become more complicated than before. What's wrong? The Shogun is really looking forward to Ochika's delivery. As such, Chamberlain Tsuchiya Tango... advised him that if it's a princess, to get a groom from the Go-Sanke (Owari, Mito, and Kishu). The three related family branches. Tsuchiya... He's working with Ochika. Perhaps... Brother, please stop it! Why do you have to listen to Tsubone-sama? The precious lives of Christians are at stake. No... There is more. You and Tsubone-sama share some kind of secret. - I am certain of that... - Sayo! I'm responsible for the lives of 58 people. But you broke the rule of Deus... by killing innocent people and putting the blame on Nemuri-sama. That's an evil act! Sayo. Are you taking Nemuri Kyoshiro's side? What did Tsubone-sama say? Tell me! Who's going to be next? Chamberlain Tsuchiya Tango-no-kami. Who are you? I don't have to see your face. Posing as Nemuri Kyoshiro and murdering people! Don't tell me you're doing it for pleasure! Are you upset? Yes, I am. Why? Why are you doing this? One reason is to anger you... in order to... fight a duel with you. That's a waste of time. Wait! Try not to get upset on your own, before making me angry. People say that... a pregnant woman's face tells us if it's a boy or girl. Takiyama, what about me? Well... I wonder which. Oh! A good luck tea leaf. Yes, it is! It must be a sign of luck! - It must be a boy! - Yes! Takiyama, I want to have a boy. The Shogun's heir. Go! Oh, they came with a palanquin. Oh! She's from the O'oku (Shogun's Harem)! What are you doing? Help me! Help me..! Be quiet! If you fight, the pain will be more severe! Who is it? You don't deserve to even know my name. What! Don't be rude to me! Showing under your kimono, you're the one who's rude. Somebody! Get him! Somebody! Shut up! Pretending to go to a temple for a safe delivery, then secretly trying to abort your baby. That's unforgivable. Give birth to a boy. Give birth to him! It's better to suffer in life. You and your child! A boy... A boy, I'll have a boy...! An heir... The Shogun's heir... Tsubone-sama. I told you not to disturb me. Yes, but... I have an urgent matter to discuss! Then come inside. I'm terribly sorry to bother you. Itakura-dono, I'm too used to it. Then, what is it? Drink it. Yes. What's the matter? Are you disobeying me? No... I'm sorry...! Drink it. Let's hear from you. After the incident, the Shogun is more concerned about Ochika. She's been in the clinic under the castle doctor's supervision. I don't care what the Shogun thinks about Ochika. She's gone insane. However, the Shogun says if Lady Ochika gives birth to a boy, he's decided to make him the next Shogun. What? To make the son of an insane woman the heir is unacceptable! Who brought this news from the Shogun? Sakai Chishima-no-kami. Sakai Chishima? We don't have to worry about him. If Kyoshiro hadn't shown up, Ochika's baby would have been aborted. What's Shuma doing? If anybody gets in your way, you kill them mercilessly. That's the Nishikinokoji way! Don't worry about that. Right now, we must take care of Sakai Chishima. We have to stop Chishima's move! SAKAI Excellent! Who're you? Move! If you don't move, I'll kill you! Lord! You! "KILLED BY NEMURI KYOSHIRO." Brother... Posing as Kyoshiro-sama... and killing innocent people, is totally against God's will. These are evil acts that breaks Deus's law. Tsuchiya and Sakai? Both were evil men trying to preserve their own power and money. By killing innocent Christians. To kill them using Kyoshiro's name, who is a disgrace to our God, is actually following God's will. My work will be finished, then we'll leave for Luzon Island to have lasting peace. Until that day comes, I have to work for Nishikinokoji no Tsubone. These days, I don't think we can trust Nishikinokoji-sama. What do you mean? Actually, we're still living safely. Whatever you say, I am responsible for these peoples' lives. This is poison from Europe... that will quickly take a human life. Alright? I'll have... I'll have a healthy boy...! Today, let me try a new medicine. I'll give you your medicine now. - Here. - Yes. Thank you very much for coming, Nemuri-sama. Nemuri Kyoshiro-sama, I have a favor to ask of you, but I knew you wouldn't come... unless we devised some way to attract you. A favor to ask? Yes... My husband was a poor mask maker called Tankei. He wanted to make a mask that showed real human emotion. That's the way he made this last piece, with his soul in it. That's it over there. However, the mask doesn't have a real soul yet. Would you please give the mask a real soul? Are you saying that I can put a real soul into the mask? Nemuri-sama, the girl with the mask is a virgin. If you give her pleasure as a woman. The mask will become a real woman. Please make love to her. Please kiss... This mask.... Sir... Please kiss... This isn't the body of a virgin, is it? Your body is too mature! How dare you touch my clean body, woman of Sodom! Poison in the mask's lips... What a stupid idea! You have... just killed your shadow... Next time, your shadow will kill you! In the name of Deus. Please punish Nemuri Kyoshiro for having insulted you. For killing people in the name of Deus, I'll punish you, too! Let's go! How was it? You must feel like you're in heaven. Even Nemuri Kyoshiro is helpless... under the nerve gas of the Iga ninja. You're too good to be killed by Shuma. I want to bind your arms and legs and play with you until I kill you. It's the best entertainment I can give you. I, Nishikinokoji, will hurt you... again and again until you've been killed. Can you really kill me? Even you can't untie the rope. If it was tied by a human, it can be untied by a human, too. That's good logic! I'll let you have a final cup of saké. Is it hard to drink? Then I'll help you with it. Stubborn man...! Kyoshiro, if you want to live, beg for your life now! You! I'll kill you. I can cut your womb in a second! Stop! Please stop! Be quiet. Kyoshiro-sama! Take these. Please hurry! Why are you helping me instead of your master? To atone for my brother's sin. Please accept my feelings. "Be responsible for fire!" "Be responsible for fire!" "Fire watch!" "Fire watch!" "Extinguish all flames!" "Be responsible for fire!" "Be responsible for fire!" Her relatives are coming in the morning to take the body. Nishikinokoji-sama ordered the body carried home right away. Brother! Kyoshiro is in the coffin, isn't he? No, he's not. Go! Kyoshiro-sama! It's best to be careful at all times. Nemuri! - Brother! - Let go! Brother, please wait! We have to hurry to let our people know. Otherwise, everything will be ruined. At last, we might leave for Luzon Island! Brother! Everyone! The day to depart for Luzon Island has come! It has been a long time, filled with pain and misery. But we persevered. Starting tomorrow, there will be no more pain for us. We'll be free! We don't have to be afraid. We'll pray to Deus! Brother! Huh? Break our law and worship the evil religion! You're under arrest! Run! Hurry! Run! My son... my son... my son...! Run..! Run...! Run...!!! Don't let anyone escape! Get everyone! It is Itakura Dogen-sama's order! Hold it! Move along! Keep moving! Let's go! Get going! Kyoshiro-sama... Sayo-dono. Forgive... ..my brother... Please... "Santa Maria... "Santo Joseph... "Deus... gracia... "Glorio..." This world is hell. If you believe in God, you better check when you get to heaven. Kyoshiro-sama... Sayo... ..will be going to heaven... The place of God... Christian people adore this liquor as "God's blood". "God's blood"! You look fine after that. That's right. The Kawaguchi siblings' mission is done. I don't need them anymore, so clean up as soon as possible. Itakura-dono, you should feel relaxed after getting all the secret Christians. Why are you here? You broke your promise! Saying you'd send us to Luzon Island! Was it all a lie in order to use us? Of course. Being secret Christians... How can you escape to another country? Realize who you are, fool! Spare me! Please don't kill me! I won't kill you. If I kill you at once, my deep anger won't be satisfied! "We have an unresolved issue to discuss. Please come to see me." "Shadow" Kyoshiro... I'm waiting for you... Lying in a grass bed instead of silk, what are you trying to do now? Let's sleep together. Kyoshiro... Please hold me. Feel pain, after your depraved life. It's all your fault. That's right. Do whatever... you want with me. This Kyoshiro doesn't like a woman who offers herself. Kyoshiro. Please... help me... Please have your way with me! It's up to the chef's skill as to whether I want to eat the dish. Chef! Show yourself! Kyoshiro! Hold her! Let her who filled her life with evil ambition... enjoy a woman's pleasure for just this one time! Kyoshiro! Please... Hurry! Kyoshiro! What's the matter?! She's the one for you! Hold her, now! Hurry... Kyoshiro... Since it's a great dish, I'll try to eat it. Kyoshiro! Hurry! Kyoshiro... Hurry... Kyoshiro..! Please make me happy... You'll have to try this! You're supposed to help people. You've taken their lives instead! Is that the way of Deus's child? I didn't care if there were more than one Nemuri Kyoshiro! But I've changed my mind. I believe Kyoshiro can only be one. I can't let you live. It's you who'll die! For insulting our God, Nemuri Kyoshiro must be punished! I've been waiting for this moment for a long time. Can you beat my Full Moon Cut? I've... never given up my religion... even after I was tortured terribly... Deus! Please forgive our sins... Please take me to... Paradise... There's no God to save you! I wish I could go with you to find out. THE END
