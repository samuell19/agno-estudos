That's why so many idiotic and foolish things you've said about it. Yes, but such beautiful and idiotic things by such loving fools. Your thinking fascinates me, Carlotta.

[GIGGLE] And sure enough, when she was on that screen they were, [GASP] they were our eyes. [LAUGHS] And they were. They were our eyes. [GASP] They sparkled, twinkled, and only because I, I made them so. Why? Why is it there's so may things that you actresses and actors go through that people don't realize. But others do. You're not fooling anyone. You're not putting anybody on. You're all see-through. Hm? [LAUGHS] [GASP] Some things are important in life. Other things just, oh, just not. And why is it? (WHISPERING) And why is it always get up so damn tight when, about certain things you say when you know that the words you say are, are your own? No. They're, they're made up by some ego idiot who's 5,000 miles to the East or West or even perhaps dead. God only knows. [SNICKER] You see it's, it's me. It's my pallet. It's my brush. I know where the beauty lies. I make the imperfections perfect. I make cheekbones. I make eyes sparkle. I make lips desirable. [LAUGHS] I even, I even make breasts where God fumbled. Now I make my prisoner, Roxane. Oh. Roxane, how beautiful you are. Oh my god! How beautiful you are! How beautiful you are. I'm hurting you. I know I am. But I can't help it. Do you understand that?

You think maybe I didn't, I didn't, I didn't, I didn't mean any. I didn't mean any. I didn't mean-- I'm, I'm, I'm old Charlie. I, I, don't even remember. Lady! I wouldn't hurt you! -(SCREAMING) Ah! You will die magnificently. CHARLIE: Who? Me? -I will compose a ballad. -Now. Now. Just a minute. I had just a-- -Death will be monumental. CHARLIE: No. No. I didn't, I didn't mean it. I was just, I was just. -Your face is fear. -I'm, I'm, I'm just old Charlie. -Mine is smile. Your death is near. We'll play a while. And at the end-- and then at the end of my poem you will meet him. Right there. [CLANK] (WHISPERING) My sword sings through the air. -Hey. That's very good. Do it again. Do it again. -It's song makes you sad, though you think me unfair. Yet it's really not so bad. -Keep going. -For at the end of my poem, heaven. -That's very good. -Heaven. Every time you take a breath, it brings you eye to eye with death. Hold tightly to that little spot. My sword will soon bring on the dark. Ah! Ah! Sir night [LAUGHS] I thrust. I push. I carry attack. [LAUGHS] If you're worth anything, you'd fly instead of waiting here to die. -I'm flying? -I'd knock you against the wall. [YA] [RUMBLE] (FEMALE VOICE) I have a, I have a rhyme missing. Prince, ask God to forgive you where the final verse begins. [SWOOSH] Touche! [LAUGHS] Although you might have been the better man, you know you should have ran as far away as Suffragan or maybe China before this all began. -Well, now look. I'm, I'm, I'm just Charlie. I'm, I'm, I'm-- -(YELLING) No! It's too late. -Yeah. I didn't mean to hurt anybody. I, I-- -It's too late. I push, pull, I bury. My ballad has ended. You're a dead canary. [GRUNT] -Ah. I, uh. I-- [THUMP] [PSYCHEDELIC SOUNDS] [SCREAM] [PSYCHEDELIC SOUNDS] [ORCHESTRA MUSIC] [ELECTRO MUSIC] -It's strange. Strange this sharing this blood, this death. One quick thrust the magic of life is over. Ha ha. Da. And then it's like a doll waiting for strings or pulleys to make him nod or dance or-- Strange. Strange. I couldn't even feel the sword enter. I thought it'd be much different. I thought it'd be-- I have a surprise for you. I have a surprise for you, darling. I'm going to let you go. (FEMALE VOICE) Yes. Yes. Yes. Only. Only if I get you to give yourself to me. Do you hear? With no reservation. Just like the rest of them. You're going to say I love you, BJ Lang. Just like they all said it. Right? Everybody else gave themself to me. They all. You'll love me. You'll say I love you, BJ. I, I-- You'll fly, fly like the wind. Is it a game? Is it a game? (ANGRILY) Is it a game?

Lovers. Lovers should do that. Sit back. Can I get you something? [CLANK] I'll get you anything you want. I, uh, have some wine. Carlotta, would you like some wine? Would you like some? How does, how does it feel to be adored? I mean really adored? So something close to madness. That's, that's what due love is anyway, isn't it? [LAUGHS] It's madness. I'm-- I, I know I'm mad. I know. I know. I know I'm mad. I know I'm mad. But I, I don't, I don't feel mad. Not any crazier than any other lover. That's what love is. It's madness, isn't it? Isn't it?

Farewell, my Roxane. For today I die. My death lies waiting in the trenches ahead. No more will I feel the look of you. No more will I hear the gentle murmur-- the melody-- your laughter. Though I die tonight, my soul will live on in a, in a world of unexpressed love, never mourning, gazing the beauty that's you. Never. For more will I see the grace of your hand, the consciously wisp away of the strand of golden hair from the blue lids. Just magnificence of your eyes. I miss these moments. And I cry. I do cry. At Rox, Rox, my, my love, my darling. Roxane. My heart was never away from you. Never. [GRUNT] Oh. [GROAN] Oh god. [GRUNT] [GRUNT] [THUMP] Ha. [THUD] [OW] Don't touch me. Don't touch me. Nobody else on the set touch me. I want now lives. I see her. She's grinning at me. Death. That's one thing they can't take from me. When I see God and I salute the threshold, sweep the threshold of death. That's the end. That's the end. My unsplotted, my white plume of pride. You hear? Do you hear it? Carlotta? You hear it? [COUGH] You hear it? Carlotta, do you hear? -Yes. -It's for you, darling. It's for, it's for all-- [THUMP] It's for you. -No. No. It's for you, BJ. All for you. -Was it, was it grand? -A triumph.
