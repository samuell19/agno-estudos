There's no one here to arrest. We always patrol the remote areas. Inspector is unfair. He gives that bitch all the good jobs. Keep that between us. Brother Sam, let's leave our route to see some action. Don't disobey our order. Sir. I.D. please. Thanks. Station, PTU 13893, calling. Send. 77 Hoi Yuen Road, checking an I.D.. ID No. Delta 258431/1. He's clean. Roger. You may go. Sir, please come over. I.D. please. Sir, your I.D. Station, PTU 25641, calling. Send. 78 Hoi Yuen Road, checking for an I.D.. ID No. Delta 258431/1, over. Another unit just checked it. What's the problem? They didn't search the subject. I don't want to miss anything, over. He's clean. Thank you. You may go now. Let's go. There's a break-in at 77 Hoi Ming Road. Any units in the area? Station, PTU 13893 is heading to Hoi Yuen Road. Station, PTU Sergeant 26316 and party are heading there. There's a break-in at 77 Hoi Ming Road, the PTU are on the way. Any other officers in the area? Had a good sleep? I'm thinking. Don't do your thinking out loud. Drive. Yes, sir. Sir, where are we going? Didn't you hear the radio? Haven't you been paying attention? Still thinking about why you're demoted? I think I just don't have the luck. If I had your luck, I'd be the Chief Inspector by now. To Hoi Ming Road. Yes, sir! Understand, sir! Police! Freeze! Freeze! Freeze! Don't move! Watch your handcuffs! You'd get in trouble if you lose it. Bastard, trying to act tough? Station, PTU unit... Stop! Why should I listen to you? May, let's talk. We're on the same column. Let's write the report together. Bin will be the AO, Roy will be his assistant. Assistant doesn't receive accolades. Let Bin be the assistant. I've been a cop for over a decade. May, this is not how a Sergeant should behave. What is the matter? What is going on? Bin caught the suspect first. Roy uncuffed him. Bin let the suspect get away. Roy caught the suspect. Bin dropped his handcuffs. Sir, Madam is covering for her subordinate... Do you want to file a complaint? No, sir. Did you cuff him securely? Were the handcuffs on? You sure they didn't catch on to his clothes? So you're not sure. Sometimes things get messy in an arrest. It was a misunderstanding. As police officers, Our job is to keep order and protect lives. Doesn't matter who caught the suspect. Sam, continue your patrol. Yes, sir. May, bring the car here. Go back to station and keep an eye on them. Thank you, sir! They must be up to something. Filthy couple. Careful what you say. You never taste hardship until you join PTU. Sergeant sneers at the tough road ahead. Chief brings you a warning. But I got my job to do. Why bother? Our duty ends next week. I want to do a good job. You should lose weight. Still gambling? No. I have no more money left. I made a terrible mistake. The memo is out. Let's see where we'll be stationed. Never mind. Wherever I'm stationed, I'd still be the driver. This is it. So long as my belly doesn't prevent me from steering. Brother Sam. Let's drink to Madam May's promotion to Station Sergeant! And Brother Roy's promotion to Sergeant! Cheers! Cheer up. Hard work will pay off. I'm just upset we lost to May's team. I feel sorry for Brother Sam. Why was May promoted instead of him? Sometimes it's all about luck. Congratulations on becoming CID detectives. You're better off! I checked my fortune before joining the force. Working for Madam May will bring me luck. Bingo! Honey, had dinner already? I'm still at the farewell party. Don't wait up for me. I'm broke... I'm not who I'm used to be. I lose half of my paycheck every month. I need to pay off my debts. I don't have any money left. Are the kids asleep? Have they been naughty? Really? Stop drinking, Fat Tong. Give me! People used to call me "Brother Tong". Now I'm just "Fat Tong"! No one respects me anymore. Money... I need more time! I have to go. Go to sleep. Bye. What? I requested a song for you. Inspector is going to sing. He's good. Of course he's good. Great voice! Beautiful face! He's our Elvis! Why are you looking at me? Nice. I'm really enjoying this! He should give concerts! At least 300 shows! All seats will sell out! Come on. Sam, can I borrow some money? What for? My mother-in-law... She lost everything in stocks. Forget it... just forget it. I didn't gamble. I really didn't. I'll give you tomorrow. Come here... Bin, I heard you'll be transferred to outer islands. You'd be perfect looking for missing cows. Let me have a look. You have the face of a jobless bum. Go to hell, bastard. Remember to salute me next time on the street. Of course I will. Madam May did everything to give you an opportunity. Look, she's even singing with Inspector Ho. Maybe she'll spread her legs for him. Sorry... Break it up! Let go, slut! What did you say? Stop that! Watch your men! It's not your business! You two want a piece of the action? Do you want me to file a report? No, sir. Sorry, sir. I'll forget about what happened here. You'll be disbanded in a few days. I don't care what you do after that. But make sure you behave until that. It's my responsibility to make sure you keep an eye on your men. Of course it's your responsibility! What do you know? You're the biggest jerk! You're biased. You're unfair. Sir, he's drunk. I'm not. I am still awake. I'm telling the truth! I'll take him home. I'm feeling a bit dizzy. Let's go. Sam, listen to me. Be honest. Isn't he a jerk? Everything's fine. Let's clean up. Brother Sam. What? Nothing. You don't have what it takes to be a cop. He's one of ours! I don't have teammates. Only enemies! Brother Sam, am I right for this job? Just think about how you can improve. Everyone needs to be taken care of. Help me up. At 10 am this morning, an armored car was robbed at Happy Valley. Shots were fired. Two guards were injured. The robbers stole two armored boxes containing cash. 30 minutes ago, police found the getaway car at the Red Flower Peak. We suspect the robbers went into to the mountains. It's close to the border. They're probably planning on sneaking into China. Our mission is sweeping. There are four targets. What is it? Sorry, sir. Code name for this operation is "Scum". Shout out the code when targets are in sight. According to eye witness, the suspects carry rifles. Can't believe this happens on our last day! My daily fortune says this is an omen. There are dangers ahead. You must run the operation carefully. Or else you'll lose your promotion. Be extra careful today. Our death pension depends on our ranks. Did you check your pistol? This is not an exercise. The mountains terrain is very different from the city. Keep your eyes open. I've studied the terrain. We're responsible for zone 5. Understood? Bravo com, patrol 1, column 4. May, you will be the IC. Sam, you will be the second IC. Understood? Yes, sir. Roger. You deserved it. We don't know when we'll stand down from this operation. She doesn't have Sam's experience.

We'll first sweep zone 2. From position H to position T in northeast. Any problem, brother Sam? No. That is it. May... Get off. Any problem? No, sir. Don't screw up today. This is an opportunity to prove yourself. Yes, sir! Don't disgrace me. Understood, sir. Be careful. Hope we won't bump into the bad guys. Heads up. Heads up. Heads up. Heads up. World Peace. Police! Quiet. What are you doing? I am busy. Go play elsewhere. Told you I'm busy. Go play elsewhere. What? Give it back. Don't interfere with police work! Station, PTU 13893... Send.

Got a light? Look at Bin. It hurts... Brother Sam. Our men don't work well together. Any thoughts? No. Madam. Loser. Gear up. PTU, Bravo Com, Patrol 1... 5508 calling Commander Ho. 5508,send. Commander Ho, I got a flat tire. Please send a mechanic to repair it. It'll take a long time. Do it yourself. Sir, this is not part of my job. You're driver. The car is your responsibility.

And a 9 years-old daughter. The police are on their way. I'll take you with my car, okay? Change the tire. Okay, no problem. Let me get it... Stop fooling around! No... no... The police will hear the shots. Don't kill me... Take me as your hostage. They'll negotiate. They'll give you a chopper. Help... Command Post, this is PTU Sergeant 4876. Due to the trail's steepness, Column 3 will take alternate route to reach position D from the north. Tiger. Take us away from the police. Don't pursue him! He's got a knife! Police! Roy... How is it? Brother Sam... Roy... Do you copy? Sam. We can't get a signal here. Calm down, it's okay... Quiet! Let's get out and report to Command Post. I won't leave teammates behind. It's not safe here. Let's wait for backup. You wait. I'll keep searching. I'm in charge here! Take me as disobeying order. What the hell are you doing? I'm just doing my job. If I screw up, you won't have an easy time either. Commander Ho will protect you. What do you mean? I earned my rank! You don't have what it takes! Go! Don't move. Does it hurt that much? Try getting stabbed yourself. I am injured too. Do you know how to bandage? Stop moving around. They'll find us soon. Cooperate with us and you'll get your things back. Sure... Bury it. Okay.

You can enjoy a nice meal and foot massage. Lighter? We didn't pass this place before. The tunnel shouldn't be this far. Let's turn around. This place is cursed! Hush! Cow! Cow! Brother Sam, the robbers may hear us. I can't find our position. What? Something's wrong, Madam May. This place gives me the creeps. Crazy. We're just lost. Calm down. Try heading south. What do you think? Which way? Damn! Calm down. Calm down. I got it! Hurry! It's just the compass malfunctioning. No, Madam May... I said the compass malfunctioned! Commander Ho... Ho... This place is haunted. Shut up! Go! Commander Ho calling PTU Sergeant 26316. Commander Ho calling PTU Sergeant 26316. Sir, no response from Madam May. Can't reach her on her cell either. Commander Ho calling PTU Sergeant 5508. Commander Ho calling PTU Sergeant 5508. They're calling for me. Don't worry. I know what to say. Go ahead, Commander Ho. Where are you? Why aren't you in the car? Sorry, sir. I went down to find the tire, but... Well, I'm a scum. Who told you to do that? Told you I'll arrange it. I told you to wait. Did you find the tire? You know where it is? No, sir. Sorry, sir. I'm a scum, I'm a scum. You are indeed. Come back now! I'm a scum! Come back at once! Scum! Sir, listen to me. I know I'm a scum. Commander Ho, I'm... It's the code. Fat Tong is in trouble. Why keep saying "scum"? My boss always picks on me. If I don't say what he likes to hear, he'll give me a hard time. He'll step all over me. Never giving me a second chance. Commander Ho calling PTU 5508. Answer him. Go ahead, Commander Ho. Do you know your way back? Want me to send someone for you? Do you know your position? His tone is different. He has an unpredictable temper. You never know what kind of mood he's in. Call him a scum. See how he'll give you a hard time. Fat Tong, do you copy? Say it. You're one big scum! I wouldn't be talking to you if I knew my location! What did you say? Who are you calling a scum? Do you want me to take away your badge? What's your position? It's hard to earn a living... Wrap this up. Okay. Commander Ho... What are you holding? Don't shoot! It's gonna blow! Be careful with the case! Don't come near, it's gonna blow... Damn! Fat Tong... Fat Tong... Do you copy? Tiger. Don't come any closer... I'll smash the case and you'd be left with nothing. Put down the case and we'll let you go. If I do, you'll definitely kill me. Drop your guns. We only want the money. Step back. I'll leave it at the turn ahead. I have nothing to do with this. Water... water... Bulky and you had bad feelings about this operation. Your prediction came true. But you're still alive. You bastard won't die so easily. Hey... What's up? If anything happens to me... can you mail this to my father? My father's turning deaf. He's staying in an elderly home. This is the way we communicate. I want to tell him. I've been made Sergeant. Please. Please. Hey... Mail it yourself. I sprained my ankle. Run. No... Brother Sam... I can't... it hurts... Get up! How is it? Let me have a look. Here? Be gentle... It hurts... You call yourself a cop? Stop crying- Stop crying! Stop crying! Brother Sam... You're better off dead. Useless! Bulky! Let's go. Let him be! Namo Amita Buddha... Shut up! Please forgive us... Madam May! Madam May... I am here! I am here! We will find the way to save you. Go! Have you seen a fat cop around? Thanks. Shit! Shit... It's over... Don't kill me... Fat Tong... Fat Tong! Sam... What are you doing? The robbers took me hostage. This case saved my life! They're still looking for me! The robbers are around? Let's find Cow first. Brother Sam, There are four of them, we're outnumbered. They have machine guns too. We should wait here for back-up. And fortify ourselves. Are you in charge here? Are you questioning my order? I don't think you're being rational. I know what I am doing. Come or not? This is just a job. Not war! Brother Sam, don't act impulsively! World peace... World peace... Over, over... World peace... Who is this? Who? Who is this? I'm the earth defense force. I'm here to ensure world peace. World peace. Over... World peace. Stop the car. World peace. Over... Defending earth. What's up? Police! Again? Freeze! Freeze! I'm Ho Ka Kit. I can't answer the phone now. Please leave a message. Chief Commander, I am sergeant 26316 from Patrol 1, Column 4. Father, which way could we go down? This is a remote area. The villages will take you down. Commander said he will send us back up. He told us to wait here. Get something to eat then. Run! Take them out of here. That way. Wait... I can't hold too long. Go! Go! Take the back exit. Maybe we... Can't you hear that? We are the police! Cover me with your bullet-proof vest! Put him down. How is he? He's unconscious. Cow... What now? Take them out of here. I'm the IC. I need to stay behind. Madam May. Brother Sam. Cow. Reload! Tung. Reload! Scum, 2 O'clock position! Give me back my wallet! The money is mine... You don't have the right to take my wallet... Do you hear me? Give it back! Give me back my money! Thanks. I don't want to pay for your funeral money. Bastard. In position! In position! World Peace. We surrender! Don't shoot! We surrender! Don't shoot! Drop your guns! Hands up, come out slowly! Raise your shirts with your left hand. Turn to the right one full circle! Slowly! Raise your hands! Turn around! Hands on your head, kneel down! Thank you. Brother Sam. Have some water. Let me check you. Where does it hurt? May. Thank you. Does it hurt here? Yes... You're such a cry baby. Stand down. Yes, sir. You never taste hardship until you join PTU. Sergeant sneers at the tough road ahead. Chief brings you a warning. But I've got my job to do. Mad dogs occupy this playground. But I continue to march forward. Facing the road ahead, I'm all alone. Seeing moonlight high above, I am all by myself. I give my flesh, I swallow the torture. I know this job is tough. But let the test continue. For I will break through.
