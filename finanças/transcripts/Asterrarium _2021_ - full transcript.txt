Can you hear me? Even though it doesn't matter now. The posts are always there. Everyone who will be affected by this last message will listen. There is no one in the building. No one is working. They've been all sent home. The honor of recording the last message was entrusted to me. A simple janitor. The authorities imposed a State of Emergency and we were forced to live in it for the past 30 years. Only a few seconds are left before the meteor impact. The City services ceased their work. As if they ever worked before. Radio and TV broadcasting will also stop soon. Problems with electricity and water supplies are possible. The trains and airplanes haven't moved, but that's since the time of the coronavirus. Actually, you don't have to worry about saving or stacking up. You can die in peace... No one can save us anyway. ASTERRARIUM Come in! Don't worry about the shoes. It won't stink. Mammy, look! Did you patch up the socks? Your irreplaceable outfit. Graduation, wedding, graveyard. God, it starts... Where did you dig up your grandpa? Did you cut the pockets open? Do you remember the wedding? Andrei! They gave him money, and his pockets were patched up. He started sticking cash down his underwear. Stop it already! Tanya the shopkeeper had the stench on her hands for two weeks. And his pubic hair was all over the shop's sausage. Can you talk like a normal person at least on this day? Go on. Start your tale. I sat there thinking... Cans. Pickles. Brought a flair gun. Maybe we can launch a flair rocket? I thought we'd do it together. You know... Want a drink? Want some ice? Or just some spit? He's been like that the entire day. Got an idea. -Mammy, come to me. -Why should I? -Well, at least to the friend zone. -I don't want to. -At least to the friend zone. Sit down. -I don't want to. Let's have a meat party. Just the three of us. A burger party, what do you say? Like we were young. I'll be the top bun... -You'll be the meat. -Bastard! Enough already! Stop it! What's wrong, Nadya? A 3-way burger. -For God's sake, stop it! -Well, you did sleep with him. That was so long ago. What's the difference? -There is a big difference. -How big? 30 years. That's almost yesterday. How old were you 30 years ago? -23. -What changed? Nothing. Look. Only her bellybutton can now touch her tits. And ours can touch our sacks. You're sick! -You're an old sick pervert! -I'm a fool. No, seriously, I'm a fool. Do you think I messed up like that all my life? This... What's her name... Aki... Masha! All of the whores stuck around at her place. -What's her last name... Akin? Yes! -Aristova? Yes! So, Masha Aristova calls me up: "Andrei, come over!". Well, you know me. I've bought a bottle of strong wine, condoms, all different kinds: condoms with little mustaches, glow in the dark ones. Filled my pockets with them. And I'm off. And then... you're calling me. You're calling me! "Come over, we need to talk!". And I'm standing there like a dumbass, thinking: there's a blazing hot chick calling me to fuck, and you're calling me to talk about your fucking misery. -Do you remember that? -I don't. That's enough. Zhdanov, I don't understand one thing: what prison were you in? Why? Your voice is higher than it used to be. It's the same. Okay. Everyone has his own thorny path. -And what did you choose, in the end? -Nothing. Really. I chose you. And Kolya shot himself. Came home, had a drink, put on his parade uniform. Not like his grandpa's. He had his police medals, medals for Donbass, Syria. Said: "Wait, Dad, why should you suffer? We'll all die in the end. Come here". Then he shot himself. Bang! No shit! Zhdanov! My condolences -What? -Set the table! -What? -What if Victor and Pavel also... Shut up! Our kids aren't the shit that his Kolya was. I'm sorry, Zhdanov. But your son was shit. -Shit! Ran over my dog. -He didn't run over your dog. Then who did? Did it run over itself, and smear its innards on your son's wheels?! The entire house hated your dog. When it got run over, we could go out safely. The dog was really fucked up. You were fucked up too. My Polkan only barked at people. There. That's what his "bark" did to me. Who the hell knows, who bit you?! Fuck knows... Maybe your sluts got passionate with you. By the way, I didn't like your Polkan either. Masters take after their dogs. Maybe you should go visit his fucking crazy son? My son was normal. Well, maybe he was. But then he got screwed over. Life smeared him on its tires, like my Polkan. -Go fuck yourself. -Where will you go? Away from you! Bastard! Bastard? I'm a bastard? -That's enough! -He called me a bastard! And you compared his son with a dog! -Zhdanov! -What? What? It's not because I'm mad. I honestly said what I think. -Did your son take bribes? -Well, yes. When you got caught with your road patrol scam, and got 4 years, did he help you? No. -And today he wanted to kill you? -Well, yes, he hid. And what am I supposed to tell you? That he's a great son and an honest law enforcement officer? Well... No. -Peace... -Where are you going? To take a walk. Come, I'll be waiting for you with an open heart! Just come! Andrei, it's clear that we don't have long to live. But I'm very sorry that I couldn't ever have a drink with you. To toast. Like friends. As they say, when a person doesn't drink or smoke, you can't help but think, whether he's a bastard. -I think Stalin said that. -Chekhov. What? Zhdanov! Have you ever seen a roll of toilet paper? White, soft. Flushable. That's the only bright line in your life. And I think I'm about to mess it up. My head is falling asleep. That's it, I can't take it anymore. Brilliant! You know... This is the best! Jerk! Bastard! I'm wasting my time here! Take this here! You know what? You are mediocre! Look! Look at it! Ain't it beautiful! Look! Here! Let me help you! Hold on to your precious little brush! 3 Â½ hours! Damn it! I'm wasting my time on you! I'm wasting my time on you! It's just... insane! I'm going bald because of how untalented and worthless you are! Just look at that pretty little thing! Think about it now! Fucking Einstein! Your Jaconda is here! God... Moses, do you have a cigarette? Fuck off! Listen... I'm sorry. I... don't have anyone else to go to. I've had a son. No matter what he was... Even if he wasn't mine. Your son stuck around all the time. Ran over my dog. What's with you? Why are you going on and on about that bitch? -He was male! -I don't give a damn! My son didn't run over your dog! It might have barked, but never smeared tires with its guts. -That's enough! -I'll decide when it's enough. Well? What? Are you giving orders now? You're shitting and I have to smell it? Don't you try crushing me with your experience. You're in my house! That's it. I can't take it anymore. I'm sorry, God! Please, God! I beg you! Make them come back today. Make them come home. Victor and Paul. -He doesn't hear you. -God! Creation is coming to an end, and we really need time to repent. It's time to open up our souls and let him in. Time to stop lying. You're Anna, right? The wife of Andrei, from Khrustal. That blasphemer and obscene man... Go on! Repent! Repent! I'm a very bad mother. I only love my son. Well, that's natural. Our children grow up and leave us. And the youngest always leaves the deepest wound. -Anything else? -Yes. Andrei. It's like he's possessed. Plus, that phone. I made a commission from him, and every time I ask about my order, he sends me off for "self-procreation". -I'm sorry. -Don't worry! It's not you. It's just that men... Men are egotistical. Like children. And a telephone is an evil thing. Straight from the devil! Anna! I'm sorry, Anna! You didn't even go to Aristova! I remember that day. I went to her place. You know how she called you? A coward! A coward, who can't answer for his own words! An impotent! Get the hell out of here, you tripper-struck motherfucker! How do I know? I know. When you go online, that's the first news you get to find out. The entire internet is on about your rotten little dick. There's a huge article on Wikipedia. 4 Academics wrote it. Zhdanov. Tripper. His wife Nadya left him. Family failure in Russia. His son Kolya is shit. Everyone knows about your tripper. The Norman 4 discussed... Zhdanov and his tripper. From the side it looks like... it looks impossible. And after that your wife Nadya left. I knew that Masha Aristova has the tripper. That's why I bought condoms. You knew? And you didn't say anything? Buddy... That's... Zhdanov, you're rough but your ass is soft. It's cold. They promised to give us a bit of hot water tomorrow. Did you cheat on me? With whom? I don't know. With somebody. -No. -What about Masha Aristova? Remember Nadya Zhdanova? Who had tripper? Did we or did they? -They did. -You see? And why did you have that young chick on your phone? I just downloaded that online. She looks like you when you were young. Do you want me to post your photo? I do. Don't you have my photo? I do. It's just the light is better. Did I really look like that when I was young? You did. They won't come. Neither Victor, nor Pavel. You know, when they were inside me, I felt that they were really there. As an integral part of me. Do you know how that feels like? It's when you want to absorb a person. When you love and want to hug and absorb someone. Do you know that I saw a horror movie once, when a couple of lovers ate each other because of love. And that was wonderful. It was so accurate. That's how I was... I absorbed them. Do you understand? They were inside me, do you understand? Yes, yes, yes. And it was... It was the highest peak a mother's love could reach. Do you understand me? I felt their mood. I felt them crying and feeling angry. And then they pissed me off and I lost that feeling. I thought... I thought: "Please don't! Bring it back as it was!". Please, bring them back into me. Do you know what I thought when I saw Pavel for the first time? I though "God! What a freak! -He's despicable!". -You don't love Pavel? That's not what I'm talking about! Do you know how happy I was when Victor was inside me? But I always knew that that will come to an end. I knew he will be dragged out from inside me. And love will come to an end. He will turn into a human! I didn't want a boy at all! I wanted a girl! You got pregnant for a second time. I'm talking about Victor! I understand. -What do you think I am? -I just understand. You never gave birth! Only a woman can truly love! And men... You all... You... You're cocks with eyes! That's ideal! Where is your dream? Where is your dream?! You and your mom went on and on: "He doesn't drink! That's the most important thing!". It would be better if you drank, like all real men! I wish you'd drink, but work normally and silently! So that you'd just do what you're told. How many times where you kicked out of the crystal factory?! How many times was I forced to go to your boss, that... what's his name? God! Prokopyev! "Please help him! Please! He's do anything you tell him to! I fell on my knees before that guy! So that they'd take you back! Every normal man has a car or a bike! And what are you doing? And what were you doing? What are you doing?! You're just sitting there! Is your ass covered with honey? What are you doing in that garage of yours? I'm asking you? Are you just sitting there? What are you doing there? Spinning your cups, are you?! God! I'm so sick of this! I'm so sick of this! If we could go somewhere together only for once! I don't know where! To Sochi! Or to Anapa! To go for vacation! To bloody Crimea! When were we on vacation?! In Tuapse? I dreamt of that all my life! I dreamt of going abroad! I dreamt of at least seeing something! Even of going to Moscow! But now we rot in this hole! Zhdanov, do you like Anya? Come on! Take her! Did you want the truth? If she hadn't called you, you'd have tripper too. Round on! Off fishing? Digging for worms? Did deeper, you'll find oil. -Uncle Andrei! Look what I found! -What? Hey, Vasya! Did they ever take you to a zoo? I'll show you an elephant! This is the left ear. This is the right! And here comes the trunk. Get it? Did you learn to dance? Yes. How much time do we have? Just a couple of hours. A couple of hours? That's a lifetime. Why did you leave me for Andrei? I thought we'd be together. You didn't even pay attention to him. -Why? -Yep. Because you didn't look at stars. You looked at a glass full of booze. Because you didn't have neither flight nor dreams. I hate you. It's all falsehood! It's all lies! It's all the West and it's the schemes in our rotten democratic leadership! A mystery of global scale at a planetary level in an attempt to take control! A truly socialist... Revolution is coming! Yes! We will annihilate enemies of humanity! All of the parasites! All of the bastards that you can't even see now! Hello, Sofia Vladimirovna! Great speech! Full of passion! Andrei! Come here! You're not looking at me kindly at all... Do you remember calling me an old cunt? In 1987? And in 1991 you called me a fucked up otter! You weren't the Aphrodite of Melos! And in 1995 you called me a rabid bitch! I remember! And you called me the same thing in 2010, 2015, and 2017! The Pension Reform isn't enough for you all! Slut! Pavel! Pasha! Come on! -Come on! Come on! -Can I? Of course! Come on! Come on! There... That's remarkable! It's amazing. Come on! You know, I really want love! I can't feel anything at all! Anything at all! You know, when Andrei gave me flowers last time? When he buried his dog! They gave him 5 carnations at the store. And he had one left. He gave it to me. I really want to be loved. I love you. I'm old. You're beautiful. I'm ugly. Even that thing makes you prettier. -I'm not talking about that. -I always loved you. Zhdanov. Kiss me. Pasha! -Ma... -Pasha... Come here! Eat up! Don't be scared, Makar, I'm scared myself. Come on, my friends! We all have a lot of skeletons in our closets. We all collect grudges, it's like the knots that don't let us live in peace. But now, I think, we need to throw it all away and, if we all are doomed to die, we will die in love. Love is everything. It's the world. And I want to confess, my dearest, that I love all of you. All of you. You, Anna... Pasha... And you, Andrei. I love you. O, pickles. Want some? -The Butterfly Effect. -What? It's when a butterfly flaps its wings in Peru, the volcano Eyjafjallajokull erupts in Iceland. Or: if a woman, let's call her a "mother-in-law" decided to install a telephone, to brag in front of her neighbors... God... Careful with the elbow! Her daughter picks up that phone and makes a call. And the man she called bought condoms and went to a chick, but didn't make it. And his friend, who didn't by the condoms, made it. Please, don't. I really beg you. So, a mother-in-law installs a phone in 1994, and in 20 years that leads a man to death. And it's the telephone's fault that his life got screwed over. One telephone call. Who called whom? Take a look! And he said that you patched up his socks! Do you mean to say that everything is the fault of the woman. You can't believe anyone! The woman who installed the phone? She installed it for the person who was meant to take the call. I brought cake, by the way. Made it myself. Shall we take a look? You know, a cake, a taxi cab, it's all temporary! Get out of the way! Out of the way! -What's wrong with you, amigo? -Buenos dias! Our roads are bad. Not only cakes... People sometimes don't make it in one piece. It's expressionism. No! It's post-expressionism. -What's with you? Everything is ok. -Yep. I'm really glad you came. It's what's inside that counts, not the shape. When was the last time you saw Victor? Why? You live in the same town. You're brothers. Well, we take after her. What are you doing? Victor will come by soon. Victor will come, we'll sit down at the table and try everything. I said he won't come. He will! Pavel wasn't supposed to come, but he did! Pasha! -What? -Why do you see Victor so rarely? Work? Yes, mom. Work. Mortgage and a car loan. I live from ruble to ruble. Victor actually helped me pay for your telephone loan. Auntie Ann, can I have some water? Go change! Drink up! Pasha, get down to the table! Thank you! Just bring me my red sweater. It's right there on the sofa. Mom, dad... I wanted to thank you. Thank you for raising my brother and I. Thank you for giving us an education, a warm hearth, love. I'm sorry that I spent the last years in Moscow and not here with you. 9 years, 4 months and 17 days. Dad, I wanted to build my own home there. Your own home? Will your old folks have a room there? It's not that. I wanted for my kids to live better than we did as kids. What were you lacking? My mother and I shared our last with you. I'm not talking about that, Dad! I'm saying that you lived poorly, so that we would live normally, and my kids should live better, and their kids, even better. Ideally! You're a moron, son. Shitted on your parents and left. That's your gratitude. And Victor ain't a fucking moron? Ain't Victor a moron? Didn't Victor abandon you?! Where is your Victor? Maybe he's assembling your table?! Victor! Victor! What did Victor do to you?! And Victor's here too. Right here. Looking at us. Stop it! Give the medals back! -Look! Victor's graduation! -Enough! -Where are my tapes? -Enough! His books are here! -And where's my Spiderman, Mom? -Enough! So, it's like that, Zhdanov... I called your Victor. Offered him to come to your place. Do you know what he said? "Why?". Anya, give me the gun. Now I'm starting to understand you. It's not love. It's just a piece of a freak... Ministry of Emergency. Don't park your cars under the trees. We need to bring Pavel back. Nine years! Was I supposed to rot in this village? Pavel left and he's shit. Victor left and he's a great kid. My cake is shit. Everything is shit. What? Fucking faggot! I'll stick those blinkers up your ass. Victor? Damn it! -Andrei! -What? Come here! I cut my tire. Don't you see? What? This is the place where you kissed me for the first time. Remember? God, what have we become? -What have we turned into? -Ann... Please forgive me. -Forgive me. -Ann... Don't say that. Forgive me for everything. I really love you. There's nothing to forgive. Nothing. Not a day went by that I didn't think about you. -We're just sucked in. -It's the routine. No, it's progress. No, I'm talking about the mud. It's just sucking us in. Mom! Dad! This is how fun our parents are. I need to tell you something. There. Look. And? Pavel, it's my boyfriend. My man. Meaning... -You're a faggot? -No. Yes. Not exactly. Pavel, I'm gay. Faggot. I'm gay. You know, it's good that I told you first. I just wanted to be honest. That's actually why I didn't want to hang out with you in Moscow. You've got a car. I thought that you'd come here on your taxi cab. Being a cabby is temporary. And being a faggot is forever. It's a great cake. Really, it is. Good job. And what's this spoon? Dad wanted to eat the comet. Got it. Listen, Pavel... Really, thank you. I'm really touched that you're not angry. Come on! I'm not a saint either! Are you also... No... No. When I was coming here... Are you working? Yep. 120. There was this guy, his wife and kid... You know, it really laid heavy on my heart. Now I feel better. You hear that? They're coming. Yeah, but don't tell them about me, ok? I'll tell them myself, ok? Listen, I don't give a fuck. Tell them what you want. I think Dad will hear you out. -You think he will? -Well, he heard Zhdanov out. -Victor! Victor! -Hi, mom. You're here. Needed to die for you to come. I want to say thank you. I want to thank you. Thank you. Thank you both for coming. I'm so glad... I'm happy even. I'm so happy. Thank you for just being there. Tell me about your life in Moscow. It's fine. Fine. Pavel called. Said let's go. And I couldn't come with Pavel. I thought that we'd be held up in the Duma, but they let us go home, and I came straight down here. So, you're a congressman? An aid. A congressman's aid. You see, I told you what a smart boy he is. If you make so much money in Moscow, take your parents with you! -Mushrooms? -I was about to. Yeah. I was about to. Wanted to make a surprise for your anniversary. Come here, I'll show you. There. It's a big, good house. Let me open it. There... Right there. You can't really see it here, but there are 10-15 hundred square meters. A glass roof. Armored. By the way, do you know what I wanted to tell you? Your son, little Victor is a faggot. -Yep. And he's got a faggot family. -Pasha... -And a faggot car. -Pasha... And this house, dad, is gay. And he's got that dude. Show him that fat faggot. Your mustached lover that you're fucking with. No, seriously... Come down to that faggot house and live like a gay quartet. -Pavel, that's enough. -Enough what? Is it my fault that he's ass-fucking with dudes? No, I don't know who's fucking who, but since you're a congressman's aid, he's the one fucking you. It's hierarchy... Shut your month. If your brother made it big, be happy for him, not envious. Envious? What is there to envy, dad? That his bumper takes a beating? If you want, I can fine tune my bumper and go down that alley too. -Stop it, Pavel! -Stop what? I built my life with my hands! With these hands! And he used his ass to make it in Moscow. Don't you dare scream at your mom! -Your mom is a saint! -Calm down, dad! Dad! -No one gave chicks the right to speak. -I'm not a chick! Peace upon your home. I thought that I still have time to visit everyone, whom I offended, whom I felt upset by, to ask your forgiveness, to repent and to forgive. Anna came by, as a penitent. You can still see her penance on her face. I forgive you the money... I gave you for the commission. But it would be better if your repent too. Padre, enough with the preaching. Life is short. Meet my wife, Anna. Our local whore... and at the same time, a praying mantis, an entertainer, crochet maker, and the head of the "50's and Older" club. My son Pavel. A moron. A lucky mortgage owner, deep in loans. With hands growing out of his ass. Defective baker. He made this shitty cake for our table. It's his creation. And this is our pride and joy: Valentina Andreevna. An aid to a congressman of the State Duma. -A fag? -Gay. And the rivers will be red as blood. It starts. The plagues of Egypt. Lord have mercy... Lord Jesus Christ, Son of the Living God... Mom! Don't embarrass yourself. I think you just killed Moses. Get him to Zhdanov! Dad... You wanted a daughter. There she is. Are you really gay? -Yes. -Totally? Totally. They're passing laws in the Duma through their rear "working stations". Izergil. Chapter 4. The Path of the Righteous... Bitch! And my wrath will come upon you. Wake up! All of you! Tomorrow I won't even be alive. And you won't. Nothing will exist by tomorrow. I wanted to tell you the truth. To be honest in these last hours. I don't give a shit what happened here. I don't care that you killed Zhdanov. You'll shit in your Duma. Are you not at all troubled that Pavel killed a whole family for a car? Your cabby son killed an entire family to steal their car. Wanted to make an impression on you. Maybe he's gay. It's fashionable now. But you're the fag. Get to the table. Hey, kitty cat! It's for Moses. I'll show the way. I thought it's for Moses. Some emo chick. Got the houses mixed up. Wandered into the wrong street. Let's go down to the table, sunny. Go on! Need to get some tape on that. Tape won't hold it. The ceiling is greasy. What if we use a cork? Just get a fork through it, and that's it. You know, why they never have sex on the Red Square? Because everyone will fuck you over with advice. Uncle Andrei, is daddy at your place? I thought you shot yourself. Why did you come here? I'll drop in. To your place. -What's going on? -Marauder-scavengers came over. Wanted to rape Mammy here. Anna. Victor... Sausages? Your custom ones? Yes. Swine gut. I was stuck at work. Came home, no trace of dad. I thought that maybe he's at your place. He didn't come by. -Maybe he left somewhere. -He can't leave. He took my gun. I'm afraid that he might do something. They told the people all kinds of shit... They've all gone crazy. But now it's ok. They settled down to feast with their families. It's ok. You did a good job. Great job for coming. You're a real family, happy, close. Take the sausages. There. They're really good. If my mom hadn't left for somewhere, we would be sitting there eating salads just like you. But she left. I don't know where. And my dad went missing too. I better go look for him. Kolya, you better go to Aristova. Maybe dad's over there. Maybe dad's over there. Kolya? Kolya... This is Uncle Andrei. Just one question. Look me in the eyes. Did you run over Polkan, my dog? Answer me! I saw it. I got my car dirty. I drove right over his dead guts. But I didn't run him over. I didn't. Kolya! No one will do anything to you! I said look me in the eyes, you filth! Mammy, Shoot him in the kneecaps! -Andrei... -Mammy, I want to hear the truth! Kolya! Enough wining! Get yourself together! You're filth... The road was covered in ice! He ran out... Remember my eyes. Remember them, filth. My dog? Your dirty dog! It ran out on the road. Your dirty little dog! Polkan loved me more than anyone on this Earth! Anya, I'm sorry... But Polkan was the only one who ate my slippers! If only you'd have eaten my slippers... Please, Auntie Annie, don't! Anna! Anna, finish him! For Polkan! Come on... Let's carry him. Easy, easy, easy... Padre? Did you rise from the dead? Andrei... What are you doing? Come to your senses. Anya... It's not what you think. -Mom! Mom! -Mom! Don't! Baby, where are you? Where are my glass slippers? I'll make her a glass coffin. So, this is where you got those little words? Come here, bitch! You beast! You underage fucked up bitch! Who are you... I'll rip your legs off! Bitch! Moron! Andrei, get down to the table. You too, padre. I'm about to confess. But let me solve something real quick. -Mom! -Mom! Get to kids' room. And close the door. Let's see... So, I'm this man's wife. These are my children. And this is Padre. He'll conduct your funeral service. -Well, peace to your home... -I said, sit down! Maybe we shouldn't... Shut up! What's your name, honey? Angelia... Sorry. I'm not aware of this whole situation. We just wanted to flex a bit. Got hooked up online. I cringed a bit, but... But it didn't go the way we wanted. I didn't know he had a family, a wife, children. I didn't know. He just seemed as a sassy hubby on his avatar. I just wanted to flex it, to get naughty at the end of the world. In Russian, you whore! Speak Russian, I said, bitch! You learned the language in school. I wanted to have sex with Andrei. Anya! Shut up, you Judas! Breathe while you can. Papa, you were like a father to me. Close the door! Dad is screwed. Anya... He invited me! Yes! He invited me! He promised to show me his workshop and to make me a pair of glass slippers. Do you know what poems he wrote me? He confessed his love for me. I'll never do it again! Plus, he said that he's a widower! Padre, start the funeral service. -Get her to the kids' room. -Daddy! It starts... I forgot! Forgot! What the fuck... So, he did finish it... Andrei! Andrei! Andrei! Au revoir, granny! Daddy look! I killed those bitches! -Old bitches! -Come on, dad, get up! Hello! Hey. Yeah, just a second! Bye! Mom! Hello? Yes, I'll take the order. I'll be right there. Dad. Mom. Attention, in 15 minutes the President of the Russian Federation will make an important address to our citizens.
