CAFÉ THE ONETIME CIRCUS ACROBA T Mr Rezsö! The full result of the lottery draw is in the the paper. Mr Rezsö! I get a drink if you won. Good, good. Sensational issue. Sensational issue. Sensational issue... Lola, is he at home? Who? Who? Your husband! All the best, Mr Gébics! COUNTBRUNO BABELSBERG GRAMMARSCHOOL OF ÖBUDA Swifter, swifter, Häflinger, sonny! Our Hungarian homeland needs able-bodied youths with a steely character! Swifter now, Häflinger! Lick out my ear... Headmaster sir, if you please... It's b flat, not b. B flat. Of course... Sure. Sure. From the top, colleagues! Epaminondas adeo fuit, not erat... ...veritatis diligens, not diligentis... ...ne ioco... mentiretur This is grade three, sonny! You'll learn your lesson... For professor Béla Nyúl... We regret to inform you that due to space restrictions we are not inclined to publish your treatise 'Additions to Hannibal's Life Story'. This is a scandal! I'm setting you to disciplinary action! How on earth could a fire occur in the school's science storage room?! You are responsible for this! Headmaster Sir, please. I was downstairs at the reception! Exactly my point! Why weren't you here?! Headmaster Sir! You are a second-class servant, man. A second-class servant's duty is to... Headmaster Sir! The science storage room caught fire! Pardon me! What do you say? How will I stand in front of His Excellency Count Bruno Babelsberg to tell him how the stuffed peacock burned down in the science storage room?! The very peacock that he's donated to our school recently. Do you think it'll suffice to tell him that all the school boasts is a stupid second-class servant?! Lack of national pride. We'll make sure to educate further generations better. That's right. National pride. What are you doing, you hapless fool? Close it at once! At once, sir! Watch out!! Everybody into the yard! Close the door!! The fire may spread! Colleague Nyúl? Where is colleague Nyúl? Headmaster Sir... here is the peacock! They're saying he went into the flames and saved it! I saw it, I was upstairs! I've yet to see such a brave man even in the movies! He risked his life! So awesome! Here he comes! Hurray! Hurray! Hurray! Hurray! Long live Headmaster Ofenthaler! Thank you! Thank you! My friends! Hungarian patriots! The Vestal flame of our patriotism, the ancient glory of our pure morality, the unquenchable national feeling burning within us, the purity of our race, and Christian morality that is flaming in our souls, these must be the solid foundations of the future of our youth! The Headmaster is a great man! I heard that he saved you too with the risk of his life. Forgive me, just four pieces, please. Kindly put it all away! We'll just put it on your tab. Thank you very much, Mr Vogelmayer. Good bye! Sorry... Give my regards to the family! Be quiet! What is this racket? Kati! Reading that Dekobra again? If I see you do it once more, I'll just... Take it away from him, Rezsö! But mom... Really. No, I won't give it away, Rezsö. If I notice it once more, you'll see what's coming to you... Good Lord, Béla! Dear Béluska... It's all right, Erzsike... It's just my clothes... You see, there was a fire at school. And well, the peacock... There was a fire at school? - Let me just see... - Oh come on. Did you hear that? There was a fire at school. Hi, Dad! Hello there, hi everyone! What did you bring us? It's... not until after supper. Your clothes are ruined for sure... Now you're forced to wear your Sunday best. Oh, you... What's this? The periodical replied regarding my Hannibal treatise. - Don't they want it either? - No. Well, come take these rags off. Does it hurt? There was a fire at school! Fire at school! Give back my book, Rezsö. I can't, Katóka. Dear mum does not allow it. You are a hypocrite! You think I don't know why you wash yourself so fervently? A woman comes to meet you tonight, meh! But Katóka! And this man of extraordinary character was called Epaminondas. Keep this name in mind: Epaminondas. He was selfless, honest, and of death-defying courage. And when he died, even his enemies chronicled about him: Epaminondas loved truth so much that he never even lied as a jest. The ancient Greeks knew that the most crucial thing in the world is honesty. And now let's see tomorrow's prep. Oh my gosh, the chair. Bujtor! We should tell him. Professor! Open your book on page 78... Professor! The headmaster wants you in the office at once. Now, immediately? Yes, sir. Till I return, you all practice Daedalus and Icarus. This case is unprecedented in our school's history. I was just informed on the phone of our colleague Gruber. He was rushed to a mental asylum this morning. Oy vey! Did he go insane? How did it happen? He has very serious symptoms. He threw all of his clothes, even his undergarments out of the window at 5 in the morning, thinking that they are all poisoned... Oy vey! None of your oy vey's, colleague Schwartz! If I may ask so, okay? Pardon me! Gentlemen! Way to drag politics into this as usual. This unfortunate event prompts us all to increase our vigilance. We'll assign with Mr Gedeon someone to guide Mr Gruber's class towards the final exams. A more serious question is the study which our unfortunate colleague was supposed to include in our yearbook. This cannot be deferred. This study needs to be at the printers by tomorrow the latest. Perhaps he actually wrote it before he... He did not write it unfortunately. All we found was the title written on a piece of paper on his desk. 'Medieval floral songs as forerunners of the Töhötöm movement'. Maybe that's what drove him mad. Please, gentlemen. Who will undertake the writing of the study? If we must, we may change its topic. How about colleague Nyúl's treatise about Hannibal? That's good! Hannibal. Clearly a good one! Hannibal indeed! My dear Béla! Will you do it? Gladly, Headmaster Sir. Beautiful ricochet, Headmaster Sir. Look at the board, son. How do we fare? You are ahead with twenty-nine, sir! Few men would be able to catch up now! Lola, why don't you get a shingle bob cut? They say short-haired women have all the sex appeal! Reverend, sir! My husband is against it. He says it doesn't fit a decent woman. 2 ice coffees, 1 black coffee... Flirting with the priest now? I'll bash your face in! Hello to all, gentlemen! My painted butterfly, how can you not love me? What is this? Are you defiling the thunderstorm that was the Marcia su Roma? This is Mussolini's anthem! In Rome. At our place, it is 'My painted butterfly'. Great minds encounter! Jews... Check! Good day to you, Lola! This is for you. It has Ramón Novarro on the cover! Gimme! Indeed, in Ben Hur! You know that you resemble him... We've a guest at spot 2, Józsi is washing the dishes! At your service, Monsieur! Look at this neat move! - May I make a phonecall? - Yes, go ahead! A double ice-cream! Hello! Hello! Get me across to 94-270 pronto! I'll have some spare time tomorrow, come before we close! And the old chap? I reckon he'll be away playing cards. Or I'll murder him till then. You little Ramón Novarro... Hello! Rising Trumpet? Yes, it's me! Nothing at the moment. No, the school is empty. The headmaster is called... Mr Ofen... Ofenthaler... He's not at home. The heck I know! He's seeing some woman. No one knows for sure! What is it? I can't hear you! Wait! All I know is that it's in Squirrel Street. Be calm, I'll get him. Yes. Secure me 2 columns, if I find out anything, I'll call. Good. Thank you. Excuse me. I am Dr Alajos Ofenthaler, the headmaster. What a coincidence! Pleased to meet you: I'm Délteki, journalist. - At your service! - At your service! Is Béla Nyúl a teacher at your place? Yes. I would like to do an interview with him. As the papers wrote today, congressman Muray addressed the case of his Hannibal treatise in an interpellation. You mean it? Yes, yes. So this attracted such a major attention? Extraordinary attention. I dare say it attracted extraordinary attention. Would you be so kind as to tell me the precise address of Béla Nyúl? Of course. 27 Squirrel street. Thank you! - At your service! - No, at your service! See you later! Here you go! There it is! ...Then Árpád Muray, brackets Töhötöm rose to speak. At the time of our deadline, he was still talking. We'll include his exceptionally interesting interpellation in our next issue tomorrow morning. Gentlemen! Have any of you read this treatise? Based on these three, with regards to modern classical philology, completely new pieces of data, it appears beyond reasonable doubt that Hannibal did not die the way that historiography thought until now, meaning that he poisoned himself, instead he fell victim to a revolution in Carthage... What the heck? We need to clarify this: A nationalist or internationalist revolution? The good kind of revolution. An ancient revolution anyways. If it'll do for a Töhötömist congressman, it will have to do for you, right? Excuse me, messieurs. Did my wife tell you where she went? No, Monsieur... Did she go away? She did. So... he fell victim to a revolution, when, by request of the aristocracy, he sought to reform taxation. A classic discovery. - Monumental. - Ingenious! Yes, indeed. Gentlemen, today is a great day. Our beloved colleague Béla Nyúl, an adept of classical philology, has marched into the annals of history. - Long live! - Long live! Long live. Thank you. I'm so happy that we met, Mr editor sir. So in tomorrow morning's issue? Yes. This way? No, this way, please. I'll escort you. Thank you. Were you and the honourable Muray good friends in your childhood? We attended grammar school together. There was a time when we shared the same desk. You know how that is, we horsed around too! How nice! It was a childhood friendship. But it never continued on later. Maybe now. Yes. - Goodbye then! - At your service! So tomorrow morning! Yes, tomorrow morning! Mr Gébics! Mr Gébics! Professor! You scared me! Good evening! Good evening! I just came to Mr. Gébics's for some nice pork chops. He is not at home, unfortunately. Impossible. You see? Cheers! Professor! Good evening! Congratulations! Thank you! Do you allow me to take a photo for the papers of you and your family tomorrow? Readily, Mr. Bradács! Thank you very much! Again, congratulations! Pleasant night to you! Thank you, same to you. Good evening, professor! Mr Vogelmayer sends this. Sonny... this is a mistake! I ordered nothing. I know that, still kindly take it from me. Good evening! Who is it? A thousand apologies. It's Benjámin Schwartz, my honourable lady. Forgive me, please open up! It's a question of life and death. What on earth do you want? I need a cigar, the finest cigar possible! You people have gone mad today! First it's your headmaster, now it's you! Was Ofenthaler here? What kind of cigar do you want? A more expensive one than Ofenthaler bought. You know Béluska, the university declines to have my son accepted. Due to the numerus clausus policy. It has a wonderful fragrance, my dear Bénike. What a wonderful fragrance! Drink some more, my dear Bénike! Thank you, my dear Béluska! You could put in a good word with your friend for us. My friend? The honourable Muray. The boy is such a decent one, a math genius! He multiplies 5 digit numbers in his head! Cheers! Who was that? Béni Schwartz. He brought come cigars. You see Erzsike, people are good after all. I always... told you so. No more lunches made up of bread and jam, Erzsike... My name will be all over the domestic press within weeks. I hope you'll be promoted to a higher wage bracket! That's the least. Perhaps the government will send me to Carthage or Rome so that I can research the historical grounds in person! Lt'll be amusing when Bruno Babelsberg will keep asking from anyone and everyone, who is this person? How come you never told me about him? Béla Nyúl is clearly academy material, I'll say! Academy! Over the fabled sea... We will be happy... Over the fabled sea... We hunger after kisses... The old student is ambling along... Along, along... God be with you, old fellows... Along, along... Professor Nyúl! Professor Nyúl! I am Hannibal. Your beloved Hannibal. Hannibal! Good evening, Mr Hannibal! Good evening! This is what I call a surprise... Please, take a seat. Nice place you have here! Much cosier than the places of our own schoolmasters... Then again, they were mostly slaves. Your visit couldn't have come at a better time! Honestly, I never counted on it! We need to stay quiet lest the children wake up. Tell me, would you answer a question of mine? With great pleasure. It's an embarrassing question. Perhaps you won't like reminding yourself to it at all. It might stir up painful memories. But for me it's important. So how did you die after all? A surprising question indeed. How did I die? Wait a bit, professor... Wait a bit. How was it? Mr Hannibal? Mr Hannibal, where have you gone? Mr warlord, sir! Forgive me, this always results in an embarrassing moment. If I fail to concentrate, I always become invisible. So... how was it? How strange! I don't remember. I don't remember. Is this a crucial question to you? Very much so. You see, based on a variety of texts, forgive me, but... I reinterpret your death in a novel manner. I contradicted official world history that the honourable Minister of Culture has authorised for 4th year pupils of high schools. And believe me, it's just as bold an undertaking as crossing the Alps with 200 elephants! - So you are afraid? - No, no. I'd just like to make sure it's true. Ack, don't even mention. That's the worst kind of fear there is! I know it from my own practice. Let's be honest though, it's a question of luck. As far as I'm concerned... How about offering me a cigar... I apologize, I'm so rude... have one. I love this brand. No doubt, true cigars come from England. Won't you light one? Thank you, I have a lit one already. I almost set my bedsheets on fire once! I never told you why I came actually. I have a song stuck in my head, and I don't know how it goes on. Help me out, please! Here it goes... God with you fellows... Along, along... This road takes me back to my homeland... I'll become a philistine... Yes! Once again! This road takes me back to my homeland... I'll become a philistine... Along, along, along... Let's bid farewell, fellows... Good morning, Mr Vogelmayer! Herr Professor! I reviewed your credits in the morning! Professor... You have a lot of debt. I'm sure you understand: Until you equalise your debt, I cannot provide you additional credits. But Mr Vogelmayer! An officer's wife, a knight's widow always notices these things... I always pegged him as suspicious... What a cowardly little fellow... Good day to you, my honourable lady. See you later, Agáta darling. Cheers, sweetie. Go ahead, professor... Thank you, I won't have any cigars today. Has the Rising Trumpet daily arrived yet? - It has, here you are. - Thank you. SUBURBAN TEACHERINCITES A REVOLUTION! Onetime war prisoner Béla Nyúl is Russia's agent Árpád Muray (Töhötöm) offered a rousing interpellation denouncing traitors amidst lecturers... Best regards. What's more, Béla Nyúl has exploited the vulnerable situtation of our venerable school caused by an unfortunate incident, cunningly smuggling his repugnant thoughts pregnant with revolutionary ideas into the yearbook! Sirs, that is not true... Headmaster Sir, you know it the best that... Are you questioning my words? Dear colleagues, say something... All of you were present. Begging your pardon. But to tell the truth, that's not how it occurred. Stay on topic, gentlemen! Just 10 more minutes, my train is leaving to Opatija. What ties do you have with Russia? No tie whatsoever. I'd like to know where you obtained the data related to your statement. Sir, I was in Russian captivity, and I found old Roman parchments on the attic of a Kiev monastery. Presumably originating from the Library of Alexandria... That's enough! - He acknowledges the ties! - I do not acknowledge them! We don't care either way! Colleague! With your asserting of Carthage's superiority over Rome, you are propagating a global Semitic dominance! This translates to an atheistic and internationalistic mudslinging against the Christian national genius! As I found out today, Punic folks belonged to the Semites. That's right! It's no accident that during the fire you happened to save the Neanderthal man's skull from the flames. This is eloquent testimony of you being a hardliner materialist. And a Darwinist. Am I right, Reverend? Well, apparently... If I may, your excellence... But the way I see it... My dear colleague. You are too young to think independently of the Government. I pose you the question... Are you willing to revoke the statements written in your treatise? No. Just revoke them, Béla. To err is human. Revoke them, colleague. To keep out of trouble. I cannot revoke them. What you're saying here are all misconstruations. I did not write a single word about politics! I wrote about Hannibal's death and nothing else! And if I am correct... ...this will be one of the biggest discoveries of modern classical philology. I cannot revoke this! Only if it is disproved scientifically! You are hereby subjected to a disciplinary action by our cultural ministry. You are suspended of your teaching position until the end of the examination. You'll either find him at Nagybátony-Újlaki's, or rather Titán constructions, he is their director! If only I knew how the yearbook got to him... Watch what you say to him, Béla! And do not shout at him! Do you promise? You are so in love with Rudolph Valentino! Just so you know, I despise him!! Give it back! You are in love! What is this quarreling? Piri took away one of my pictures! Daddy, she's in love with Rudolph Valentino! I'm about to slap you! Okay, see you later, children! See you, daddy! My dear Béluska, I have to tell you... I sent it to Muray, I just wanted to help out! I thought that it would help! Excuse me! Is this the honourable Muray's car? No, it's the other one! To hell with you... What are you doing with that sculpture? For the pigeons... bread... Anyone can say that. You'd better watch out, I've been watching you for an hour now! Officer! Albert Apponyi had a false beard! False indeed? But we could see through it! My ice-cream! My ice-cream! To the Wave-bath! My dear friend! I did not mean to cause you inconvenience. I did not even read the... thing. Which battle was it again? I received the interpellation in a ready-made form. Hello there, your honourable ladyship! Congratulations! What can I say, my friend? This is politics! Remember when we studied Julius Caesar who stabbed his own son? Don't be scared. We'll sort things out. Listen, come visit me at the Parliament! There's a clear view to the baths from there, including the females-only section! Are you still so bashful? Holier-than-thou, are we? Just a bit dodgy round the ears. Béla! Béla! Do you feel better? I'll say, you scared me! Did you have some seizure? No. I can't swim. Awesome! He cannot swim! He cannot swim! And he comes to the Wave-bath to have a bath! Hilarious! Let us drink onto this big fright! Excuse me! - I am Béla Nyúl. - Oh yes, forgive me. My best friend and onetime classmate. Anna Mária Anetta, an artiste of the Moulin Rouge! It's Mici to you! Alright, come here! Cheers to you both! Looking at the little redhead? A pretty little thing, huh? Here, have one. Béci, listen to me here. Forget your miserable professorial life! I'll get a job for you at any of my own companies! Whenever you like it. We've got everything here: Export business, cheese factory, funeral enterprise, sorghum cultivation, Heroes' Album, you name it. But I'd like to remain a teacher, congressman sir. Árpi: For you, it's simply Árpi. Have you ever seen such an idealist? In fact, he was always like this. Like this in his entire life. Cheers then. It'll be too much for me, cong... Árpi. Out of question! We meet after 23 years of absence and we're not supposed have a few drinks? Drink up! Do you feel well yet? I do. This music is good enough. Why don't we dance? Come, professor, let's have some fun! Those were the good old times! Béla, can you recall Pálpusztai? He was our classmaster. Once I sawed the feet of his chair and he thought it was you! And it was you whom he punished! And you did not betray me. He was my best friend at all times. My dear Béci! Béci... See where I brought you! I met them at the Duce's. All of them are distinguished, excellent fascists. They will drain all the marshland. High time for us to drain own our marshes as well. Right? We need to drain 'em. If there is marsh to be found... My painted butterfly... The little bird singing in the tree... Jesus... Stop it! What a diplomatic complication... Don't be alarmed! Cheers. Who is it? Open up! My dear Rezsö, it's nighttime... Open up!! My husband is at home, stop shouting! Who's here with you? Nobody. My dear Rezsö... what do you want? My dear Rezsö, do not fret... Please! On what grounds... do you dare... to... Stop it! Rezsö! Berci! Just stop! So then... there won't be any trouble, my Árpi? Don't even bother, old pal! All miracles last three days! Then all the world will shut up about it. I'll talk to the minister tomorrow not to make a fuss. There's a heatwave anyway. No one gives a rat's arse about such trifles right now! Kiss my best friend! One more time! One more time! One more time! HUNGARIAN BRO THERS IN ARMS! A CAMPFOR CALLING TO ACCOUNT THE RESPONSIBLE IS TO BE ORGANISED A T THE ÖBUDA AMPHITHEA TRE. - Is there anybody here? - Yes, please. Could you kindly guide us to Vestibule of Hell Street? Of course, sir. I am on my way there myself. Come with me. Where do you come from? From Pomáz. They start handing out the welfare for soldiers' families today, at 8 in the morning. We would like to be first. Interesting, we have received the same honours. Where did you receive the Grand Silver? At the breakthrough of Gorlice. How interesting, I was wounded there too. In the May of 1915. Same here. They shot out my eyes at dawn on 18 May. DEA TH TO ALL BÉLA NYÚLS! Look at that! Go straight, and turn left at the small square. DEA TH TO ALL BÉLA NYÚLS! Töhötöm Blood Alliance, Koppány Tribe With patriotic salutation... knight Árpád Muray Don't cry, Erzsike! You'll see, everything will be all right. Honestly, I wouldn't trade places with the chap who printed that atrocity. Surely he must be an overeager pupil of his masters. Do you think it wasn't him? I think he doesn't even know about it. They abused his name. You know how that is. Children, stop eating all that! You won't be able to eat lunch! Sure we will! Leave some for the smaller ones! Where are you going, Béla? To find Muray. I'll talk to him once more. These gadgets look wonderful! Gee daddy, you look so nice and solemn. Don't I just! It's burned, Erzsike! Do you know how a real cook makes pancake? - How? - I saw it once. Show me, daddy! Very well. Give it to me, Erzsi. We put some fat into it. Then the dough. Not a big thing. It's just a question of courage. We let it fry for a few seconds. When one side is done, whee, we throw it. And let the other side fry. How smart you are, daddy. See you later, children. See you, Erzsike! Take care, Béla! Very well. I'll be home by lunch. Do some cocoa-filled ones, Piri loves those. Well, bye-bye. Bye, daddy! So I tell her: My dear Aranka, A true housekeeper has an easy time with that too! And I struck her butt as a joke! Look at that! He even put out his badges! Check please! At your service, Monsieur. - 3 pints. - 1,50. Good day, Headmaster sir! Hey, professor! Józsi, bring my coat and hat! - Are we going there? - We are! Gee! Hannibal's coming! - Good day, professor! - Good day. Well, Talabéri, are you studying for your makeup exam? Yes, professor! I went over Epi... Epaminondas yesterday. Very good. Carry on with diligence! Good day, professor! He's going there! Kind regards, Headmster! Sensational issue! Fresh pretzels! Fresh pretzels! ...and it has a chariot race... Professor! Good day, professor! All I want to tell you is... You would still receive a credit from us. Thank you, Mr. Gébics! You are very kind! My acquaintance, Gittácska: Professor Nyúl. Good day, professor! - Well, goodbye. - See you. Excuse me, sir! Could you tell me the way to the amphitheatre? Kindly turn right, go till the third corner, turn left there, and you'll spot it from there. Thank you. Bound to be a big show, huh? A big one for sure. Long live Muray! Long live Muray! My first thought at this camp which I must shout out to the world is that we in the Töhötöm Blood Alliance, young folks unified as brothers in arms, who will safeguard till the very end of times, the purity of our race and the ancient glory of our morals, with the Vestal flame of our glowing patriotism we shall carve onto the sky of history with fiery brazen letters that the God of Hungarians is still alive!! Long live Muray! The era of slogans has come to an end! Racial protection of flesh and blood is what our present and future belongs to! And on the path of practical racial protection, our first step is to annihilate all the Béla Nyúls, these insidious little rats gnawing away at the groundroots of our Christian national morals, and each of their allies! Hurray! Down with the revolutionary provokers, who wear the mask of honour, but in reality they poison our youth in words and in writing! I want to head this great movement which aims to erase from public life everyone who fails to appreciate the far-reaching ideas of our wide horizons! Hurray! Erase them! Erase them! Look! He's so cute as he's standing there! Long live professor Nyúl!! Long live... This moron is coming over! What does he want here? Erase them! Erase them! Honourable Muray! This isn't what you promised me yesterday! What, what, what's this? This is provocation! That is Béla Nyúl, the Judas! The revolutionary provoker! Stop this!! Brothers! Stop it! Fricking hell, what can we do now?! Stop! Lynch him! Lynch him! People! Stop! People! Brothers! Quiet! Brothers! Hungarian future belongs to the Töhötöm Alliance! Because it's strong and knows what it wants. This is why our enemies dread us! Hurray for the Töhötöm! Hurray for the Töhötöm! What do you intend to say? As your friend I warn you to think it over what you want to say. You have four children. Hurray for the Töhötöm! I call upon Béla Nyúl to speak! Gentlemen... I am Béla Nyúl. Suspended high school Latin professor. I wrote a treatise in which I linked Hannibal's death to a revolution in Carthage... Stop! Stop! Stop! Brothers! Take it easy! Let us hear the defendant through. I admit that... I made a mistake. It was a mistake, because Hannibal... Hannibal could not be swept away in a revolution. Because the Vestal flame of Hannibal's patriotism, the ancient glory of his pure morals, kept a vigilant watch over the national and Christian morals of the Carthage youth. Because the example of Hannibal, the great racial protector, the Punic warlord, teaches us that... Look! The congressman brother is smiling! ...we should walk tall and with spine at all times... ...to be unrelenting, and uncompromising. Because Carthage's groundroot was founded on racial purity. As the Honourable Muray put it much more eloquently than I could. And Hannibal was clinging to this very groundroot when he wrote on the sky of history with fiery letters: The God of Hungarians is still alive! Long live professor Nyúl!! Indeed! If this Hannibal would still live, he would belong amongst us! Hurray for Nyúl! Hurray for Hannibal! Hurray for Hannibal! Hurray for Nyúl! Hurray for Hannibal! Hurray for Nyúl! Hurray for Hannibal! Hurray for Nyúl! Hurray for Hannibal! Hurray for Nyúl! Hurray for Hannibal! Hurray for Nyúl! Hurray for Hannibal! Hurray for Nyúl! Hurray for Hannibal! Hurray for Nyúl! Hurray for Hannibal! Erase them! You moron! Hurray for Hannibal! Hurray for Nyúl! Hurray for Hannibal! Bound to be a representative by next year! And a member of the Academy! Let us listen to Nyúl! RHUMBA, THE NEWDANCE, ENGULFS ALL OF BUDAPES T THE END
