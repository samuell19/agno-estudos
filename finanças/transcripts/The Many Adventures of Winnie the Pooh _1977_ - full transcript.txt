This could be the room of any small boy, but it just happens to belong to a boy named Christopher Robin. Like most small boys, Christopher Robin has toy animals to play with. They all live together in a wonderful world of make-believe. His best friend is a bear called Winnie the Pooh, or "Pooh" for short. Pooh had some unusual adventures, right here in the Hundred Acre Wood. Deep in the Hundred Acre Wood Where Christopher Robin plays You'll find the enchanted neighbourhood Of Christopher's childhood days A donkey named Eeyore is his friend And Kanga and little Roo There's Rabbit and Piglet And there's Owl But most of all Winnie the Pooh Winnie the Pooh Tubby little cubby all stuffed with fluff He's Winnie the Pooh Winnie the Pooh Willy nilly, silly old bear Winnie the Pooh Tubby little cubby all stuffed with fluff He's Winnie the Pooh Winnie the Pooh Willy nilly silly old bear Winnie the Pooh lived in this enchanted forest, under the name of Sanders, which means he had the name over the door in gold letters and he lived under it. Now, when Pooh heard his Pooh-coo clock... He knew it was time for something. But he was a bear of very little brain. So when he thought, he thought in the most thoughtful way he could think. I haven't thought of anything, have you? Nor neither have I. Think... Think... Think... Oh, yes, time for my stoutness exercise. Up, down, up. When I up, down, touch the ground It puts me in the mood Up, down, touch the ground In the mood for food I am stout, round and I have found Speaking poundage-wise I improve my appetite when I exercise Oh, stuff and fluff. That's better, thank you. Now, where was I? Oh, yes. I'm rumbly in my tumbly. Time for something sweet. I am short, fat and proud of that So with all my might I up, down, up, down to my appetite's delight While I up, down, touch the ground I think of things to chew Like honey and milk and chocolate. With a hefty happy appetite I'm a hefty, happy Pooh With a hefty, happy appetite he's a hefty, happy Pooh Oh, bother. Empty again. Only the sticky part is left. That buzzing noise means something. The only reason for making a buzzing noise that I know of is because you're a bee! The only reason for being a bee is to make honey. The only reason for making honey is so I can eat it. So Winnie the Pooh climbed the honey tree. He climbed and he climbed and he climbed. As he climbed, he hummed a little hum. I call it my Rumbly in my Tumbly song. Yes, it went something like this. I am so rumbly in my tumbly Time to munch an early luncheon Oh, I wouldn't climb this tree If a Pooh flew like a bee But I wouldn't be a bear then So I guess I wouldn't care then Bears love honey and I'm a Pooh bear So I do care So I climb there I'm so rumbly in my tumbly Time for something... For something sweet to eat! If only I hadn't... You see, what I meant to do... And it all comes, I suppose, from liking honey so much. Oh, bother. Winnie the Pooh crawled out of the gorse bush, brushed the prickles from his nose, - and began to think. - Think... Think... Think... The first person he thought of was... - Winnie the Pooh? - No. Christopher Robin. Christopher Robin lived in another part of the forest where he could be near his friends, and help them with their problems. On this summer day, gloomy old Eeyore, being stuffed with sawdust, had lost his tail again. - Eeyore, this won't hurt. - Never does. There now. Did I get your tail back on properly, Eeyore? No matter. Most likely lose it again, anyway. It is my considered opinion that Eeyore's tail should be placed a trifle to the right. Now, if you were to ask me, I think it's just a wee bit... South. No, no. North, dear. Cheer up, Eeyore. Don't be so gloomy. Try swishing it. - It worked. It worked. - Oh, goody! Thanks. It's not much of a tail, but I'm sort of attached to it. Good morning, Christopher Robin. Oh, good morning, Winnie the Pooh. - Good morning, Pooh bear. - Good morning, Pooh bear. If it is a good morning, which I doubt. What are you looking for, Pooh bear? I just said to myself, coming along, thinking and wondering, if you had such a thing as a... Such a thing, Christopher, as a balloon, about you. What do you want a balloon for? Honey. But you don't get honey with a balloon. - I do. - How? I shall fly like a bee up to the honey tree. See? But just a minute. You can't fool the bees that way. You'll see! Now, would you be so kind as to tow me to a muddy place of which I know of. So Christopher Robin towed Winnie the Pooh to the very muddy place. Pooh rolled and rolled until he was black all over. There, now. Isn't this a clever disguise? What are you supposed to be? I'm a little, black rain cloud, of course. Silly old bear. Now, would you aim me at the bees, please? Careful, Pooh. Hold on tight. Yes. - Four... - Yes. ...three... - Yes. ...two... - Yes. ...one! I'm just a little black rain cloud Hovering under the honey tree I'm only a little black rain cloud Pay no attention to little me Everyone knows that a rain cloud Never eats honey No, not a nip I'm just floating around Over the ground Wondering where I will drip Christopher Robin, I think the bees S-U-S-P-E-C-T something. Perhaps they think you're after their honey. Well, it may be that. You never can tell with bees. Oh, I'm just a little black rain cloud Hovering under the honey tree Christopher Robin! I think it would help with this deception, if you would kinda open your umbrella and say... - "It looks like rain." - It looks like rain. It looks like rain. Christopher Robin, I have come to a very important decision. These are the wrong sorts of bees! Excuse me, please, bees. Christopher Robin! Oh, bother! I think I shall come down. I'll catch you, Pooh. Hurry, come on. The bees! Help! Christopher! Christopher Robin, you never can tell with bees. Now, Pooh was not the sort to give up easily. When he put his mind to honey, he stuck to it. Now, honey rhymes with bunny, and bunny rhymes with... Rabbit? I like Rabbit because he uses short, easy words, like, "How about lunch?" And, "Help yourself, Pooh." Pooh? Lunch? Oh, no. Not again. Oh, my. Oh, my goodness gracious! Is anybody at home? What I said was, "Is anybody at home?" No! Bother! Isn't there anybody here at all? Nobody. Must be somebody there, because somebody must have said, "Nobody." - Rabbit, isn't that you? - No! Isn't that the Rabbit's voice? I don't think so. It isn't meant to be. - Hello, Rabbit! - Oh, hello, Pooh bear. Pooh bear! What a pleasant surprise. How about lunch? Oh, thank you, Rabbit. And help yourself, Pooh. Would you like condensed milk or honey on your bread? Both! But never mind the bread, please. Just a small helping, if you please. There you are. Is something wrong? Well, I did mean a little larger small helping. Perhaps it would save time if you took the whole jar? Thank you, Rabbit. So Pooh ate, and ate, and ate, and ate, and ate, and ate and ate, and ate and ate! Until at last, he said to Rabbit, in a rather sticky voice... I must be going now. Goodbye, Rabbit. Well, goodbye, if you're sure you won't have any more. Is there any more? - No, there isn't. - I thought not. Oh, help and bother! I'm stuck. Oh, dear! Oh, gracious! Well, it all comes from eating too much. It all comes from not having front doors big enough! Oh, dear, it's no use. Only one thing to do. I'll get Christopher Robin. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, my heavens to Betsy. - Well, if it isn't Pooh bear. - Oh, hello, Owl. Splendid day to be up and about one's business, quite. I say, are you stuck? No, no, just resting, and thinking and humming to myself. You, sir, are stuck, a wedged bear, in a great tightness. In a word, irremovable. Now, obviously, this situation calls for an expert. Somebody call for an excavation expert? I'm not in the book, but I'm at your service. Gopher's the name. Here's my card. What's your problem? Yes, yes, yes, yes. It seems the entrance to Rabbit's domicile is impassable. To be exact, plugged. - And you want me to dig it out? - Precisely. I say, it's over here, my good fellow. First thing to be done is get rid of that bear. He's gumming up the whole project. Dash-it-all, he is the project! Hard digging, might hit bedrock. Danger of cave-in. Risky. Needs planks for bracing. Big job. Take two, three days. Three days? What about lunches? No problem, I always go home for lunch. Oh, this will run into money. I say, how much? Do the job for hourly rate, plus cover materials, plus overtime, plus 10%. And your estimate? Nope, can't give an estimate. Too risky. Blast-it-all. Good idea! We'll dynamite, save time. What's the charge? The charge? Oh, about seven sticks of dynamite. No, no, no, the cost! The charge in money? Nope, no charge account. I work strictly cash. Obviously, but I should think... I can't stand around lollygagging all day. Got a tight schedule. If you think it over, let me know. You got my card. I'm not in the book. Dash-it-all, he's gone. After all, he's not in the book, you know. Here we come. Don't worry. Cheer up, Pooh bear. We're coming. We'll get you out. Well, maybe. Silly old bear. Here, give me your paw. It's no use. I'm stuck! Well, if we can't pull you out, Pooh, perhaps we can push you back. Oh, no! Not that! Oh, my gracious! Oh, dear! Having got this far, it seems a pity to waste it. Pooh bear, there's only one thing we can do. Wait for you to get thin again. Oh, bother. How long will that take? Days. Weeks. Months. Who knows? Oh, dear. If I have to face that thing for months, I might as well make the best of it. Oh, no! There it is again! Well, I'll just turn it to the wall. Oh, dear! Yes, a frame. No. No, no, no. No. Very nice. And a splash of colour. It just doesn't have that rustic, informal look. There. A hunting trophy. I know just the thing. Something tickles. Oh, Pooh! You messed up my moose! Pooh? Roo has a little surprise for you. - Flowers. - Honeysuckle. No, Pooh, you don't eat them. You smell them. That's not bad. Not bad at all. It's rather good, I think. Oh, no! Oh, no! Help! Why did I ever invite that bear to lunch? Why, oh, why, oh, why? While Pooh's bottom was stuck at the top of page 28, his top was stuck at the bottom of page 30. So both ends waited to get thin again. Day after day. Night after lonely night. I wonder what's for breakfast? Breakfast. Lunch. - A lunch box! - It certainly is! I'm working the swing shift, you know. Time for my midnight snack. Say! Ain't you that stuck-up bear? I still think I could blast you out of there. What sort of lunch is in that lunch box? Well, let's see here. Summer squash... Salmon salad, succotash, spiced custard, and honey. Honey? Honey? Oh, no! Could you spare a small smackerel? Say, you ought to do something about that speech impediment, sonny. Thank you, Gopher. Oh, no! Not that! No, no, no, no, no! Not one drop! But, Rabbit, I wasn't going to eat it. I was just going to taste it. I'll taste it for you. That supercilious scoundrel confiscated my honey. I'm going to skedaddle. I'm not in the book. And I'm ding danged glad of it! And then, one morning, when Rabbit was beginning to think he might never be able to use his front door again, - it happened. - He budged. Hooray! Christopher Crabin. No, Chrostofer Raban. He bidged! He badged! He booged! Today is the day! Hooray for you Hooray for me Hooray, hooray The Pooh will soon be free Now the time has come for proving What the diet did for Pooh And since we pledged he'd be unwedged That's what we're going to do He'll be pulled and he'll be tugged And eventually unplugged We'll have a tug-of-war To open Rabbit's door Think heave-age Think ho-age And out the Pooh will go-age For mind over matter Has made the Pooh un-fatter Heave, ho Heave, heave, heave, heave Heave... There he goes! Suffering sassafras. He's sailing clean out of the book! Quick! Turn the page! Stuck again. Don't worry, Pooh. We'll get you out. No hurry. Take your time. Bears love honey and I'm a Pooh bear Yum, yum, yum, yum Yum, yum, yum, yum Time for something sweet We come to the next chapter in which... But I haven't finished yet. But, Pooh, you're in the next chapter. What happens to me? Well, let's turn the page and find out. Now, one fine day, the east wind traded places with the west wind. That stirred things up a bit all through the Hundred Acre Wood. On this blustery day, Pooh decided to visit his thoughtful spot. Yes, and on the way I made up a little hum. It hums something like this. Oh, the wind is lashing lustily And the trees are thrashing thrustily And the leaves are rustling gustily So it's rather safe to say That it seems that it may turn out to be It feels that it will undoubtedly It looks like a rather blustery day today It seems that it may turn out to be Feels that it will undoubtedly Looks like a rather blustery day today Fortunately, Pooh's thoughtful spot was in a sheltered place. He sat down and tried hard to think of something. Think, think, think, think, think. Think... Think... Think... Say, what's wrong, sonny? - Got yourself a headache? - No, I was just thinking. Is that so? What about? I... Oh, bother, you made me forget. If I was you, I'd think about skedaddling out of here. Why? Because it's Winds-day. Winds-day? I think I shall wish everyone a happy Winds-day. I shall begin with my very dear friend, Piglet. Piglet lived in the middle of the forest in a very grand house, in the middle of a beech tree. Piglet loved it very much. Yes. You see, it's been in the family a long time. It belonged to my grandfather. That's his name up there. Trespassers Will. That's short for Trespassers William. Trespassers William? Yes. And Grandma. She called him T.W. That's even shorter. Yes, yes, yes. And on this blustery day, - the wind was giving you a bother. - Now, you've been here before. I don't mind the leaves that are leaving. It's the leaves that are coming! Happy Winds-day, Piglet. Well, it isn't very happy for me. Where are you going, Piglet? That's what I'm asking myself, where? Pooh! What do you think you will answer yourself? Oh, I'm unravelling! Oh, that was a close one! Hang on tight, Piglet. Oh, dear. Oh, dear, dear! Look, Mama, look! A kite! Oh, my goodness, it's Piglet! Happy Winds-day, Kanga. Happy Winds-day, Roo. Can I fly Piglet next, Pooh? Oh, dear. Oh, dear, dear! There, that should stand against anything. Oh, help, help! Somebody, save me! - Happy Winds-day, Eeyore. - Thanks for noticing me. Oh, bother! Oh, what a refreshing day for harvesting. Happy Winds-day, Rabbit. Pooh bear! Stop! Oh, go back! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, yes! Next time, blow through my rutabaga patch. Who, who, who... Who is it? It's me. Please, may I come in? Well, I say now. Someone has pasted Piglet on my window. Well, well! Pooh, too. This is a surprise. Do come in and make yourselves comfortable. Am I correct in assuming it is a rather blustery day outside? Yes, sir, Owl. It's a very, very blustery day outside. Oh, yes. That reminds me. Happy Winds-day, Owl. My good fellow, I wouldn't go so far as to call it a Winds-day, just a gentle spring zephyr. Excuse me, Owl, but is there honey in that pot? Oh, yes, of course. Help yourself. Now, as I was saying, this is just a mild spring zephyr, compared to the big wind of '67. Or was it '76? Oh, well, no matter. Oh, I remember the big blow well. I'll remember this one, too. It was the year my Aunt Clara went to visit her cousin. Now, her cousin was not only gifted on the glockenspiel, but being a screech owl, also sang soprano in the London opera. Thank you, Piglet. You see, her constant practising so unnerved my aunt, that she laid a seagull egg by mistake. Oh, dear. Oh, dear, dear. Well, I say now, someone has... Pooh, did you do that? I don't think so. As soon as Christopher Robin heard of the disaster, he hurried to the scene of Owl's misfortune. What a pity. Owl, I don't think we will ever be able to fix it. If you ask me, when a house looks like that, it's time to find another one. That's a very good idea, Eeyore. Might take a day or two, but I'll find a new one. Good, that will just give me time to tell you about my Uncle Clyde, a very independent barn owl, he didn't give a hoot for tradition. He became enamoured of a pussycat, and went to sea in a beautiful pea green boat. Owl talked from page 41 to page 62. On page 62, the blustery day turned into a blustery night. To Pooh, it was a very anxious sort of night, filled with anxious sorts of noises. One of the noises was a sound that had never been heard before. Is that you, Piglet? Well, tell me about it tomorrow... Eeyore? Oh, come in, Christopher Robin. Now, Pooh, being a bear of very little brain, decided to invite the new sound in. Hello, out there. Oh, I hope nobody answers. Hello, I'm Tigger! - You scared me. - Sure I did. Everyone's scared of tiggers. - Who are you? - I'm Pooh. Oh, a Pooh, sure. - What's a Pooh? - You're sitting on one. I am? Oh, well, glad to meet ya. Name's Tigger. T, I, double "guh," err. That spells "Tigger." But what is a tigger? Well, he asked for it. The wonderful thing about tiggers is tiggers are wonderful things Their tops are made out of rubber their bottoms are made out of springs They're bouncy, trouncy, flouncy pouncy fun, fun, fun, fun, fun But the most wonderful thing about tiggers is I'm the only one I'm the only one Then what's that over there? Oh, hey, hey, look, look, look. Oh, what a strange looking creature. Look at those beady little eyes, and that pur-posti-rus chin, and those ricky-diculus striped pyjamas. Looked like another tigger to me. Oh, no, it's not! I'm the only tigger. Watch me scare the stripes off of this impostor. Is he gone? All except the tail. He's gone. You can come out now, Tigger. Tigger? - Hello, I'm Tigger. - You said that. Oh, well, did I say I was hungry? - I don't think so. - Well, then I'll say it. I'm hungry! Oh, not for honey, I hope. Honey! Oh, boy, honey! That's what tiggers like best. I was afraid of that. Oh, say... Yuck! Tiggers don't like honey! But you said... That icky, sticky stuff is only fit for heffalumps and woozles. You mean elephants and weasels. That's what I said. Heffalumps and woozles. Well, what do heffa... Halla... What do they do? - Nothing much. Just steal honey. - Steal honey? They sure do. Well, I'd better be bouncing along now, chum. Cheerio! The wonderful thing about tiggers is tiggers are wonderful things Their tops are made out of rubber their bottoms are made out of springs They're bouncy trouncy, flouncy pouncy fun, fun, fun, fun, fun But the most wonderful thing about tiggers is I'm the only one I'm the only one Well, if what Tigger said was true, and there really were heffalumps and woozles about, there was only one thing to do. Take drastic precautions to protect his precious honey. Oh, hello. Am I glad to see you! It's more friendly with two. Now, you go that way, and I'll go this way. You didn't see anything, did you? Neither did I. Now, the very blustery night turned into a very rainy night, and Pooh kept his lonely vigil, hour after hour after hour. Until, at last, Pooh fell fast asleep and began to dream. Heffalumps and woozles. Heffalumps and woozles steal honey. Beware. Beware. They're black, they're brown they're up, they're down They're in, they're out they're all about They're far, they're near they're gone, they're here They're quick and slick they're insincere Beware, beware Be a very wary bear A heffalump or woozle is very confusil A heffalump or woozle's very sly, sly, sly They come in ones and twosles But if they so choosles Before your eyes you'll see them multiply Ply, ply, ply They're extraordinary So better be wary Because they come in every shape and size Size, size, size If honey's what you covet You'll find that they love it Because they guzzle up the thing you prize They're green, they're blue they're pink, they're white They're round, they're square they're a terrible sight They tie themselves in horrible knots They come in stripes or polka dots Beware, beware Be a very wary bear They're extraordinary So better be wary Because they come in every shape and size Size, size, size If honey's what you covet You'll find that they love it Because they'll guzzle up the things you prize They're black, they're brown they're up, they're down They're in, they're out they're all about They're far, they're near they're gone, they're here They're quick and slick they're insincere Beware, beware Beware, beware Beware Is it raining in there? It's raining out here, too. As a matter of fact, it was raining all over the Hundred Acre Wood. There was a thunderstorm on page 71. And on page 73, there was a bit of a cloudburst. It rained and it rained and it rained. The rain, rain, rain came down, down, down In rushing rising rivulets Till the river crept out of its bed And crept right into Piglet's Poor Piglet he was frightened With quite a rightful fright And so in desperation A message he did write He placed it in a bottle And it floated out of sight And the rain, rain, rain came down, down, down So Piglet started bailing He was unaware atop his chair while bailing he was sailing And the rain, rain, rain came down, down, down And the flood rose up, up, upper Pooh too was caught and so he thought I must rescue my supper Ten honey pots he rescued Enough to see him through But as he sopped up his supper The river sopped up Pooh And the water twirled and tossed him In a honey pot canoe Rain, rain, rain came down, down, down When the rain, rain, rain came down, down, down So the Hundred Acre Wood got floodier and floodier. But the water couldn't come up to Christopher Robin's house, so that's where everyone was gathering. It was a time of great excitement. But in the midst of all the excitement, Eeyore stubbornly stuck to his task of house-hunting for Owl. There's one. Cosy cottage. Nice location. A bit damp for Owl, though. Meanwhile, little Roo made an important discovery. Look! I've rescued a bottle. And it's got something in it, too. It's a message, and it says... Owl, you fly over to Piglet's house, and tell him we'll make a rescue. A rescue? Yes, yes. Of course, of course. So Owl flew out over the flood and he soon spotted two tiny objects below him. One was little Piglet caught in the whirlpool, and the other was Pooh, trying to get the last bit of honey from the pot. Oh, Owl, I don't mean to complain, but I'm afraid. I'm scared. Now, now, Piglet, chin up and all that sort of thing. A rescue is being thought of. Be brave, little Piglet. It's awfully hard to be brave when you're such a small animal. To divert your small mind from your unfortunate predicament, I shall tell you an amusing anecdote. It concerns a cousin of mine, who became so frightened during a flood that he... I beg your pardon, Owl, but I think we're coming to a flutterfall, a flatterfall, a very big waterfall. Please, no interruptions. There you are, Pooh bear. Now, to continue my story... Look, there's Pooh. Over here, Pooh! Oh, hello, Christopher Robin. Pooh, thank goodness you're safe. - Have you seen Piglet? - Excuse me, I have... What I mean is, here I am! - Pooh, you rescued Piglet. - I did? Yes, and it was a very brave thing to do. It was? - You are a hero. - I am? As soon as the flood is over, I shall give you a hero party. Attention, everybody. Now, this party is a hero party, because of what someone did. And that someone is... - I found it. - Found what, Eeyore? House for Owl. I say, Eeyore, good show! Oh, isn't that wonderful. Where is it, Eeyore? If you want to follow me, I'll show it to ya. Everyone followed Eeyore. Then, to the surprise of all, Eeyore stopped right in front of... Piglet's house? Why are you stopping here, Eeyore? This is it, Owl's new house. Oh, dear, mercy me! Oh, dear, mercy me, too! Name's on it and everything. W-O-L. That spells "Owl." Bless my soul, so it does. Well, what do you think of it? It is a nice house, Eeyore, but... It is a lovely house, Eeyore, but... It's the best house in the whole world. Tell them it's your house, Piglet. No, Pooh. This house belongs to our very good friend, Owl. But, Piglet, where will you live? Well, I guess I shall live... I suppose I shall live... With me! You shall live with me. - Won't you, Piglet? - With you? Oh, thank you, Pooh bear. Of course I will. Piglet, that was a very grand thing to do. A heroic thing to do. Christopher Robin, can you make a one-hero party into a two-hero party? Of course we can, silly old bear. And so, Pooh was a hero for saving Piglet, and Piglet was a hero for giving Owl his grand home in the beech tree. We never will forget our hero of the wet Our quick thinking unsinking Pooh bear And Piglet, who indeed helped out a friend in need For truly they're the heroes of the day So we say hip-hip-hooray for the Piglet and the Pooh Piglet and Pooh we salute you What's all that stomping and singing and silly shenanigans? Hip-hip hoo-ray Hip-hip hoo-ray Hip-hip hoo-ray for Winnie the Pooh And Piglet, too! I sure like bouncing. Wasn't that fun, Piglet? Yes, Pooh, but the best part is when it stops. In the next chapter, there's a great deal of bouncing. There is? I think that I just remembered something that I forgot to do yesterday and shan't be able to do tomorrow. So I suppose I really ought to go back and do it now. - Goodbye, Pooh. - Goodbye, Piglet. Now, is the next chapter all about me? No, no. It's mostly about Tigger. Oh, bother! - But you're in it. - Oh, good! What will I be doing? Well, Pooh, you'll be sitting in your thoughtful spot, thinking, as usual. Think, think. Think, think, think. Think. Think. While he was thinking, all of a sudden... Hello, Pooh! I'm Tigger! T, I, double "guh," err. - That spells "Tigger." - I know. - You've bounced me before. - I did? Oh, yeah! I re-cog-go-nise you. You're the one stuffed with fluff. Yeah. And you're sitting on it. Yeah! And it's comfy, too. Well, I gotta go now. I got a lot of bouncing to do. T-T-F-N. Ta-ta for now. There goes Tigger, bouncing in on his friends when they least expect him. Oh, hello, Piglet! I'm Tigger. Oh, Tigger. You scared me. Oh, shucks. That was just one of my little bounces. It was? Oh, thank you, Tigger. Yeah. I'm saving my best bounce for old long-ears! There! That should do it. Oh, no! Stop! Hello, Rabbit. I'm Tigger. T, I, double "guh"... Please! Don't spell it. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Just... Just look at my beautiful garden. Messy, isn't it? Messy? Messy? It's ruined! It's ruined, Tigger. Oh, why don't you ever stop bouncing? Why? That's what tiggers do best. The wonderful thing about tiggers is tiggers are wonderful things Their tops are made out of rubber their bottoms are made out of springs They're bouncy trouncy, flouncy pouncy fun, fun, fun, fun, fun But the most wonderful thing about tiggers is I'm the only one I'm the only one Order, please. Now, I say, Tigger's getting so bouncy nowadays, that it's time we taught him a lesson. No matter how much we like him, you can't deny he just bounces too much. Excuse me, Rabbit. Perhaps if we could think of a way of un-bouncing Tigger, it would be a very good idea. Exactly! Just what I feel. What do you feel, Pooh? Pooh? Haven't you been listening to Rabbit? I listened, but then I had a small piece of fluff in my ear. Could you say it again, please, Rabbit? Well, where should I start from? From the moment the fluff got in my ear. Well, when was that? I don't know. I couldn't hear properly. Pooh, we were trying to think of a way to get the bounce out of Tigger. I've got a splendid idea. Now, listen. We'll take Tigger for a long explore, see? Someplace where he's never been, and we lose him there. Lose him? Oh, we'll find him again, next morning. Mark my words, he'll be a humble Tigger. A small and sad Tigger. An, "Oh, Rabbit, am I glad to see you" Tigger. It will take the bounces out of him. Now, all in favour say "aye." Aye. Pooh? Pooh! - Here. - Good. Motion carried. It was agreed they'd start the next morning, which, incidentally, turned out cold and misty. Pooh, as usual, had a little something along to sustain himself. And now, as Tigger kept bouncing farther and farther into the mist, Rabbit thought it was a good time to lose Tigger. Now's our chance. Quick! In here. Hide. Tigger's lost now, isn't he, Rabbit? He's lost, all right, Piglet. Oh, goody. This is lots of fun, Pooh. My splendid idea worked. Now, home we go. Good! It's time for lunch. - Hello! - Oh, my goodness. Hide! Hello! That's funny. They must be lost. Hello! Hello, hello, hello. Hey, you blokes, where are ya? - He... - Shush. I am shushed. Hey, where in the heck are you guys? Hello! Rabbit? Piglet? Where are you? Hello! Hooray! Hooray, we've done it. Come on, hurry. Let's head for home. Rabbit was certain everything was going according to plan, and so it seemed to be. But sometime later, on the bottom of page 123... It's a funny thing how everything looks the same in the mist. He's right, Piglet. - It's the very same sand pit. - I think so, too, Pooh. It's lucky I know the forest so well, or... Or we might get lost. Well, come on. Follow me. Now, Pooh was getting tired of seeing the same sand pit, and he suspected it of following them about. Because, whichever direction they started in, they always seemed to end up at it. - Rabbit. - Yes? Say, Rabbit, how would it be if as soon as we're out of sight of this old pit, - we just try to find it again? - What's the good of that? You see, we keep looking for home, but we keep finding this pit. I thought if we looked for this pit we might find home. I don't see much sense in that. If I walked away from this pit, and then walked back to it, of course I should find it. I'll prove it. Wait here. So Pooh and Piglet waited in the mist for Rabbit. And they waited, and waited, and waited. And all the while, Pooh's thoughts kept returning to his honey pots at home. What was that, Pooh? My tummy rumble. Now then, come on. Let's go home. But, Pooh, do you know the way? No, Piglet, but there are 12 pots of honey in my cupboard, and they have been calling to my tummy. They have? Yes, Piglet. I couldn't hear them before, because Rabbit would talk. I think I know where they're calling from. Come on. We'll just follow my tummy. They walked off together and, for a long time, Piglet said nothing so as not to interrupt Pooh's honey pots. Sure enough, as the mist got thinner, and just when Piglet began to know where he was... Hey, hello there, you two blokes. Where have you been? We've been trying to find our way back home. Pooh, I don't think Rabbit's splendid idea worked. Say, where is old long-ears, anyway? He must still be missing in the mist. Well, leave it to me. I'll bounce him out of there! T-T-F-N. Ta-ta for now. Meanwhile, Rabbit was still wandering around in the mist. By now, he was lost and bewildered. And to make matters worse, his mind was beginning to play tricks on him. What's that? Pooh? Piglet? - Help! - Hello, Rabbit! Tigger! But you're supposed to be lost. Tiggers never get lost, bunny boy. Never get lost. - Of course not. - Oh, no. Come on, Rabbit. Let's go home. Hang on! They started back. Rabbit was now a humiliated Rabbit, a lost-and-found Rabbit, an "Oh, why, oh, why, do these things happen to me" Rabbit. Now we come to the next chapter, in which the first snowfall had covered the Hundred Acre Wood. And in which Tigger learns that even bouncing can be overdone. On this day, Roo was waiting for Tigger to take him out to play. Mama, when is Tigger gonna get here? Be patient, dear. He'll be here. Well, here I am! Did I surprise you, Roo? You sure did! I like surprises. - Hello, Mrs Kanga, ma'am. - Why, hello, Tigger, dear. She called me "dear." Roo, are you ready for some bouncing? Yeah! You and me are good bouncers. Just a moment, dear. Hold still. Goodness, you're bouncy today. That's what roos do the best-est. - Now keep your scarf on. - Not so tight, Mama. - Is your sweater warm enough? - Yes, Mother. Well, come on, Roo. Let's go! Tigger, have Roo home in time for his nap. And be careful! Don't worry, Mrs Kanga. I'll take care of the little nipper. What a perfect day! Peace and quiet, and thank goodness, no Tigger. Say, look, look, look. If it isn't old long-ears. Can tiggers ice skate as fancy as Mr Rabbit? Can tiggers ice skate? That's what tiggers do the best. Say, this is a cinch. Oh, no. Not him! I can't... Watch out! - It can't be! - Out of my way! Look out! I can't... Oh, why does it always have to be me? Why, oh, why, oh, why? Tigger, Tigger, are you all right? Tiggers don't like ice skating. So Tigger and Roo went farther into the Hundred Acre Wood looking for something that Tiggers do best. I bet you can climb trees, Tigger? Climb trees? That's what Tiggers do best! Only Tiggers don't climb trees. They bounce them! Come on, let's go. I almost bounced clear out of the book. Some bouncing. Say, how did this tree get so high? Hey. Hey! Hey! What's happening now? Don't swing on a string, it's much too frail, the best kind of swing is a tigger's tail. Stop that, kid. Please. S-T-O-P. Stop! You're rocking the forest. What's the matter, Tigger? Oh, thank goodness. I was just getting see-sick from seeing too much. We'll have to leave Tigger up in the treetop for a little while. Because, at the bottom of the next page, Pooh is having a problem of his own. What are you doing, Pooh? - Tracking something. - Tracking what? That's what I asked myself, Piglet. What? And what do you think you'll answer yourself? I shall have to wait until I catch up with it. Pooh, for a bear of very little brain, you sure are a smart one! Thank you, Piglet. Now what? A very mysterious thing, Piglet. A whole new set of tracks. See? And so it seemed to be. There were the tracks joining each other, here, getting mixed up with each other, there. But to Pooh, quite plainly, four sets of paw marks. Piglet, whatever it was that made these tracks, has now been joined by a whatever-it-is. Yes. And all of them are proceeding in company. Piglet, I wasn't exactly expecting company. Neither was I, Pooh. So they went on, feeling a little anxious now, in case the animals in front of them were of hostile intent. Hello! Look, look, Piglet, there's something in that tree over there. Is it one of the fiercer animals? Hello! Yes. It's a jagular. What do jagulars do, Pooh? Well, jagulars always call, "Hello!" And when you look up, they drop on you. I'm looking down, Pooh. Hello! Hey, Tigger, it's Pooh and Piglet. Pooh! Piglet! Why, it's only Tigger and Roo. Come on. Hello, Roo. What are you and Tigger doing up there? I'm all right, but Tigger's stuck. Help, somebody, please. Get Christopher Robin. It wasn't too long before word got back to Christopher Robin and the others that Tigger was in trouble. Hello, Pooh. Hello, Piglet. What's up? - Tigger and Roo are up. - Oh, my goodness. Roo, how did you get way up there? Easy, Mama. We bounced up. Oh, gracious. Do be careful, dear. I'm all right, Mama, but Tigger's stuck. Oh, what a shame. That's too bad. No, that's good. You see, he can't bounce anybody up there. Oh, dear! We'll just have to get him down, somehow. Down? Down? Do we have to? Come on, everyone. Let's hold the corner of my coat. You're first, Roo. Jump! Try not to fall too fast, dear. Oh, thank goodness. Gee, that was fun! Come on, Tigger. It doesn't hurt. Jump! You're next, Tigger. - Jump! - Jump? Tiggers don't jump. They bounce. Then bounce down. Don't be ri-dic-cour-ous. Tiggers only bounce up! You can climb down, Tigger. But tiggers can't climb down, because their tails get in the way. Hooray! That settles it. If he won't jump and he can't climb down, then we'll just have to leave him up there forever! Forever? If I ever get out of this, I promise never to bounce again. Never! I heard that, Tigger. He promised! Did you hear him promise? I heard him. I heard him! You heard him, didn't you? Well, Tigger, your bouncing really got you into trouble this time. Say, who are you? I'm the narrator. Please, for goodness sakes, narrate me down from here. Very well. Hold on tight. You can let go, Tigger. Never. But, Tigger, look for yourself. You're perfectly safe. What did I tell you, Tigger? Come on. Back we go. Good old terra firma. Say, I'm so happy, I feel like bouncing. You promised. You promised. Oh, I did, didn't I? You mean, I can't ever bounce again? Never! Never? Not even just one teensy, weensy bounce? Not even a smidgen of a bounce. Oh, the poor dear. Oh, that's too bad. Christopher Robin, I like the old, bouncy Tigger best. So do I, Roo. - I do, too. - Me, too! Of course, we all do. Don't you agree, Rabbit? - I... I... - Well, Rabbit? Well, I... I... That is... What I mean... Well? I... Oh, all right. I guess I like the old Tigger better, too. Oh, boy! You mean, I can have my bounce back? Come on, Rabbit. Let's you and me bounce. Good heavens! Me bounce? Why, certainly! Look, you've got the feet for it. - I have? - Sure. Come on, try it. It makes you feel just great! Well, say, it does, doesn't it? Come on, everybody. Bounce! Come on, bounce. The wonderful thing about tiggers is tiggers are wonderful things Their tops are made out of the rubber their bottoms are made out of springs They're bouncy trouncy flouncy pouncy fun, fun, fun, fun, fun But the most wonderful thing about tiggers is I'm the only one I'm the only one And so, we come to the last chapter in which Christopher Robin and Pooh come to the enchanted place. And we say goodbye. Goodbye? Oh, no, please, can't we go back to page one and do it over again? Sorry, Pooh, but all stories have an ending, you know. Oh, bother. Yes, the time had come at last. Christopher Robin was going away to school. Nobody else in the forest knew exactly why or where he was going. All they knew was it had something to do with "Twice times," and how to make things called "ABC's," and where a place called Brazil is. Pooh? What do you like doing best in the world? What I like best is me going to visit you, and you saying, "How about a smackerel of honey?" I like that, too. But what I like best is just doing nothing. How do you do just nothing? Well, it's when grownups ask, "What are you going to do?" And you say, "Nothing." Then you go out and do it. I like that. Let's do it all the time. You know something, Pooh, I'm not going to do just nothing any more. You mean, never again? Well, not so much. Pooh, when I'm away just doing nothing, will you come up here sometimes? You mean, alone? - Just me? - Yes. And, Pooh, promise you won't forget me, ever? Oh, I won't, Christopher, I promise. Not even when I'm 100? - How old shall I be then? - Ninety-nine. Silly old bear. Wherever they go, and whatever happens to them on the way, in that enchanted place on top of the forest, a little bear will always be waiting.
