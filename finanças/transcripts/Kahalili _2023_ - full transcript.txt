You are a sinful woman! You are a whore! Do you know who I am?! You are a whore! I am here to once more purify you. I am here to save you from hell! Who am I? Who am I? I will ask you again... Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? A child of God! You are a child of God! Martha? Are you Martha? The one from the agency. Yes, ma'am. I'm Isabel. Come in, please. I've been waiting for you. How was your trip? It was fine. Did it take long? - Not really. - There was no traffic? None at all. Let me show you around the house so you can familiarize yourself. Alright. Come on. Please, come in. This is our home. It is yours now, too. That is my husband. There is only the two of us in this house, at least for now. Let's go downstairs, I will show you the kitchen. Careful going down, Martha. Take it slow. Your tasks here are quite simple. You will clean, and of course, do laundry. The usual household chores. You know how to do laundry, yes? Yes. This is the kitchen. I know how to cook as well but— "As we know, it is stated in the Bible that we women should serve our husbands." But... I need help, I need you, Martha. Should I show you your room so you can rest? You must be tired from the trip. Come. You must be worn out. You should rest now. This is our bedroom, Rod's and mine. And this one here is your room. Just nearby. This is your room. I'm sorry if it's a bit small. You can put your things down now. I'm sorry. That's okay, you might be feeling homesick. You should make yourself comfortable. This will be your home from now on. I asked your agency to send someone with a bit of knowledge about animals. You're not squeamish around them, are you? No, ma'am. I believe that we should care for what we eat. This is one of the things you'll have to do. Get used to it, Martha. You will be doing this every day. You'll clean up after them. Let me help you, ma'am Isabel. No, no. Sit down. For your first week, I will be treating you as a guest. Do not touch the food yet. We must wait for the man before we accept the blessings. Let us wait for my husband. There he is. Is she the one? This is Martha. Good evening, sir. Good evening. Sit down. Let us sit down and eat. Sorry I just got home. I was swamped with work. Tell us a bit about yourself. There's nothing interesting about my life. You don't have a boyfriend? Not yet, I've never had a boyfriend. So you haven't been... touched. No, not yet. Who is on your mind? Who is on your mind? Who? Martha. Who? Martha. You should repent, Rod. Your eyes are sinful. Repent! Penitence on the cross. You are sinful, Rod! You are sinful! There's no one I can choose here. None! Do you really need to choose? You already know the answer, don't you? Well, you know who it is. God himself sent her to us. Isabel, she is a pure woman. There is no woman more fit to bear God's blessing to us than someone like her. Ma'am Isabel, are you okay? Some of them are alive. You know nothing about losing a child! You know nothing! Sorry about earlier, I was not able to hold back my emotions. That's okay. I understand. You do not understand. Four times. Sorry? I've had four miscarriages already. Four times my dream of being a mother was thwarted. Four times the dream of having a child was taken from me. I'm sorry. It is not your fault, why are you apologizing? But you know, Martha, God knows what each one of us needs. And your arrival here, among all the possible helpers we could have on this farm, I know there is a reason why you are here. I would like for you to carry mine and Rod's child, Martha. What? Listen to me. You know of my profound devotion to God, and with that, is my belief in the natural way of procreation. So should you accept my offer... we will do it in the natural way. The way God had intended. Through intercourse with Rod. You mean sex? Yes. One million pesos! I know what I am asking of you is not easy, so I am offering you a million. It is not payment, but a blessing. A blessing from God. I will add a hundred thousand if you agree. Even before anything happens. As long as you agree, I will give it to you. Come, let us pray so God will guide us. Come, let us pray together. This is your first time seeing our chapel, right? Yes. I often spend my time there. If you cannot find me in our room or in the kitchen, I am surely in here. Do you pray, Martha? Come here. You blacked out. Martha? Think about my offer carefully, okay? Here is one hundred thousand pesos, just take it. How are you? You still got your supply? Do you know where Carlos is? No, I thought you two were together. What are you doing here again? I got an offer. They want me to have their baby... but in a natural way. What will you do? I don't know. What do you think? Only you can answer that. What's important is that no matter what happens, you can't blame anyone else but yourself, because it's your decision. They said they'd give me a million pesos. Drink this. It should help with conception. Drink up! Take your clothes off. All the way? Yes. Hello? Carlos? Is Bungo still looking for you? Yes, damn it, he won't leave me alone. I'm being extra careful now. How about you? Where are you staying? I have a job, but I still go to my sister's house. Are you crazy? You might run into Bungo there. You'll end up buried in a ditch somewhere. Don't worry, we'll be able to pay our debt to him soon. How? You're going to sell your body? Huh? How are you feeling? I'm okay. Are you comfortable here? - Happy? - Yes. I'm really sorry. You got dragged into this. We just really want to have a baby. - We're getting desperate. - But why me? Just because. We just know that you're the chosen one. There's no other explanation. Do you feel something here? What? What happened to that? Did you have sex with another man? You must repent. Come. What the hell! What are you up to? - You bitch! - Let me go! How can you be that selfish? You're carrying a child now! Damn it! Let that go! I don't know if I can keep doing this! I don't know how to be a mother. It's too much! I thought I could handle bearing a child. I thought this would be easy! Oh, now it's hard? Look at me, damn it. Look at me! You're having a hard time? What's next, you're gonna run away? I knew it! You'll never change! Why do you think of me like that? Everyone sees you that way, you understand? I can't rely on you! That child you're carrying, I feel sorry for it to be born to someone like you! Damn you! - Enough! - Martha! Enough already! Damn it! I'm pregnant. You're pregnant? I'm having a baby? Thank you, Lord! This is a huge blessing, Isabel. I'm so happy for you and Rod. Thank you, thank you so much! But none of this would have happened without Martha. She helped us get a baby. Where is she? Martha! Are you okay? As much as I want to be happy tonight... for the gift of life we have been blessed with, someone must atone for breaking one of God's commandments. My husband, Rod, broke the seventh one, "Thou shall not commit adultery!" Remember... every move, every sin has a consequence. You, Martha, will bring joy to our barren lives. Let's celebrate Martha! Let us all take a drink. Damn it! What's your deal? Does it hurt? Are you stupid? You know, I went to see my sister. What are you doing? I just wanted to talk to her. Have you lost it? What's wrong with that? I just wanted to apologize. It wasn't our fault, okay? Don't you get that? It was all an accident, so get over it! But I like talking to her. Where are you going? Are you leaving me? You're crazy! Carlos! Martha. Just like pigs... They treat me like a pig... a whore. They treat me like a whore. I've quit using drugs. But I'm scared. What if I die during childbirth? Who will take care of my child? I still want to see her. I want to take care of her. What's this? Finally you decide to be a good mother? What do you want? Do you want a medal? Do you want me to clap for you? Please. I actually thought you're growing a conscience, but then I remembered, you don't have one. You can't care about anyone else... even for that baby that came from you! That's how iredeemable you are! Remember that! Can't I change? Change? You can't change! You'll die that way. But don't worry, bad weeds grow tall, you'll live a long life. You always put yourself first, because you only love yourself! That's why that child, I wonder if you'd even call it your child because you're nothing but their distinguished whore. It won't change who you are. We apologize for the sensitivity of the following report. Authorities are in search of a woman and a man, believed to be the main suspects in the victim's death. Law enforcement is now actively seeking these alleged culprits in connection with this heinous crime. - Ma'am Isabel! - Yes? Have you seen my cellphone? No, why? I left it in my room last night, it's gone now. No one else has been there, maybe you misplaced it. No, I'm sure it was in my room. You know, when you're pregnant, you tend to forget things. Why? Who do you need to speak to that you're so anxious? My sister. We will call her. But wherever your sister is, I'm sure she's happy you're here. With a safe place to stay and people taking care of you, right? Look at you, you've grown so big already. You need to be careful. Just stay here. Don't worry, we'll take good care of you. Just stay inside, you and my child. Stay here, in our home. It has finished giving birth, it no longer has use. This can't be. We can't stay here. My baby... we're leaving. We'll leave this place. We're not going back. Martha? Help me out! Please help me. They'll kill me once I give birth. We should go! I will take care of this child, I will be a mother. Martha. Stop fooling yourself... Gina. Didn't you leave me to die? Didn't you leave me to die? Wait a sec! Martha! Gina! Are you even eating? You're so thin! Of course. Why are— Don't tell me you still haven't stopped using? Martha. Do you have some extra money? You really only visit when you need money. What are you doing to yourself? Look at you, you're skinny as hell! At least she's not fat. What did you say? Just kidding, I'm just messing with you. You know, if you had left this good-for-nothing boyfriend of yours, your life might have turned out better. What the hell did you say? - Am I wrong? You're useless! - What?! Carlos! You have the nerve! Get out! - He's my boyfriend and I love him. - Just because it's your house? The drugs ruined you brain. He's unbelievable. We just need a place to stay. For how many days? I don't know. I won't be around next week. The agency I'm working at offered a job at the farm. I'd be staying there. You can live here while I'm gone, but don't even think about letting that guy stay here. That is my only condition. Gina, I'm doing this for you. I want our lives to get better. Don't you want that for yourself? I begged you, Gina. But you were deaf to my cries. It wasn't my fault, I couldn't have done anything! Of course it's not your fault... After all you're always the innocent one, always the victim. Hey. Did you get the money? Hey. Hey, fatty. Why are you so mad at me? Carlos! - [shushing] - Cut it out. I'm just talking to your sister. You know what, you're passable... If I didn't know any better I'd take you on. Maybe you should eat less. Go on a diet. Who knows, maybe someone would finally love you. You're the reason my sister's life is ruined! You have the gall to insult me in my own home? Because screw you! That's why. Carlos, stop! You're the most useless piece of shit I've ever known! I don't know what my sister saw that made her crazy over you. Maybe the drugs really turned her brain into mush, huh? Because no person in their right mind would even consider you! So?! Bastard! - Carlos, stop! - I said don't touch me! Martha! Martha! Please don't hurt her! Carlos, stop! Help me! Please don't hurt my sister. Martha! Martha! Martha! Have mercy on me. Give me some peace. Gina? Is Carlos with you? What? No. He's been gone the whole day. Didn't you hear? Bungo and his group are looking for him. He messed up a drug deal. Bungo says he'll kill you both! We apologize in advance for the sensitive nature of this report. Parts of the body of the victim, Martha Avanzado, aged thirty, have been found. The victim had been missing for several months, and finally,there is clarity on what befell the woman. Authorities are now searching for a man, and a woman, who are the main suspects for this murder. A friend of the victim reported that Martha's sister, Gina Avanzado, and her boyfriend Carlos Guzman, had previously stayed at their residence. Authorities are now on the lookout for the two, - Considered prime suspects, - Is that Martha? in this heinous crime. What are you doing? I'm calling the police. No, don't do that. What about my child? If she goes, my child goes with her. I can't bear to lose another. - Let's go. - Come. Don't even dream about being a mother. I pity the child you're bearing. You are evil... The thought of you being a mother... it makes me sick. What happened to you? We need to get out of here. We need to leave. We? Yes, me and my child. That's not your child. It's mine! We've discussed this. I'm taking the baby back! I'll repay all the money I've spent. This is my child. Martha, let's talk about this. There's nothing left to talk about. It's my child and I will be the one to care for it. Where, Martha? In prison? You think we wouldn't know who you are? Gina? You think I'll let a criminal raise my child? There's nothing you can do! It's mine! There is a lot! There's a lot I can do, Gina! So, if I were you, I'd get on your knees and beg. Take care of yourself so you can safely deliver my child. I'm the baby's mother! No! It is not your child. And may I remind you, you're a murderer. You've broken the sixth commandment. No penance will save you. You're destined for hell. You could ask for help to save the child, but then you'd end up in jail, you wouldn't want that, right? You'd rather save yourself because you're rotten inside. You don't care about anyone else... not even the child you're carrying. You'd choose to let the child inside you die, rather than pay for your crime. For what you did to me.
