(TENSE ACOUSTIC GUITAR PLUCKING) (TENSE MUSIC BUILDS) (TIRES SCREECHING) (LOADS GUN) JACOB: In Jackson County, North Carolina... ..my family name meant somethin'. Outlawin' was just a matter of blood as hair color and height. By the time I was nine or ten, Daddy had me breaking down big bags of crystal. He got it from the Mexicans through his biker buddy, Ed McGrew. The auto shop was just a front where I worked with Gerald and his skinny-assed brother Jeremy. They were the ones that did Daddy's dirty work. And everyone in these parts knew he was not the kind of man you wanted to cross. Even though they were mean as hell, the Cabe brothers were the closest thing I had to kin. (TRAIN HORN BLARES) Methamphetamine was a living, breathing body in Jackson County. And Daddy was the heart... ..pumping blood through every vein in the region. I got a cut from the sales like most kids got allowance. But Daddy held onto my money for...safekeeping. Maybe it's a life I could've accepted... ..as generations of McNeelys had done before me. But Maggie Jennings... ..she made it so I couldn't.
