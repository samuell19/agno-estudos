My mother's waiting for me. - How much? - Three thousand. - Three thousand? - Hey, come on. Let's go. Thanks. [Crowd chattering] [Girl] As he entered the room, all eyes fell on his lean, sinewy body. A trail of sweat snaked its way from the nape of his neck to his heaving chest. "Dominique's senses sharpened as she turned to look at him." "And as her eyes met his," "she felt this strange phenomenon of desire wash over her." [Reading To Herself] "Oh, Lance, all I feel inside..." "is this surge of undefiable passion." - "What am I to do?" - Hey. - What? - Late again. You know how Pa hates to wait. - I was working. - How come Leslie never late? Leslie's not even coming home tonight. We waited 20 minutes for you already. Mui, eat your food. - Dominique. - What? - Dominique. - Well, change again, huh? We always eat at half past 6:00. I finish work at 6:00. You know how long it takes for me to ride home. So why must we eat at half past 6:00? Why half past 6:00? - Magic time, huh? - At half past 6:00, Pa is hungry. At half past 6:00, the food is ready. At half past 6:00, all the family sit down and eat. - Half past 6:00-- - [Father] You are half past 6:00! You got a half past 6:00 job. You can't even come home at half past 6:00... to eat with your family because you stop and do your half past 6:00 motorcycle. You think I don't know. Then you rush down to talk with your half past 6:00 friends. Even when Leslie's working so hard in the hospital. Ah Beng. His name is Ah Beng. Why must you call him Leslie? - He gave himself that stupid name. - Don't talk bad... about your brother. Okay, if he's so good, how come he never comes home for dinner, huh? How come we only see him two or three times a week? Just because he's gonna be a doctor, - he's too big shot to come home. - Hey! When Pa was out of work, who helped the family? Ah, forget it. [Crickets chirping] [Sighs] What's this junk? "Dance competition." [Scoffs] [Exhales] [Man On TV Speaking, Indistinct] Hey, Bruce, you're on TV. [Kung Fu yell] Dragon set movement number four. Dragon seeks his prey. Dragon whips his tail. - [Boy Speaking, Indistinct] - Hey. Ribena, my mother says it's good for me. Mmm! Dragon has to go and bathe. [Hock] ♫ Everybody was Kung Fu fighting - Hu! ♫ ♫ The king of expert... timing - Ha! ♫ Kung Fu fighting - Hu! ♫ Don't think. Feel. Enter the Dragon, 1974. I tell you, this one is damn solid. But I don't know whether she's Chinese or Japanese. I press the button, out come these. I wish Chinese, Japanese, press the button, out come these. Hey, it's Ah Hock. - I told you guys he would be late. - What do you mean I'm late? - Hey, Mei. - Hey, Hock. Sit down, huh? Triple five. Two dollars. - Hey, you free tonight? - No. - What's the problem? We'll go for a drink. - You can drink it too, right? - [Speaking Chinese] - Not free. Hey, do you know who I am? - Hey.

If you need a job, look for me. - Are you okay now? - Used to it by now. - But thanks, Hock. - Hey, what are friends for, right? - Hey, Hock, what are you doing back there? - Nothing. What do you mean nothing? Come on. Hey, what do you want to do now? - Bowling. Go bowling. - Let's go see a show. - What show? - The Bruce Lee one. - What show? - Fists of Fury. - Fists of Fury. - Seen that one before. - Where's it showing? - Ah...

[Exhales] [Mui Reading] "Lance looked into her eyes," "his gaze penetrating the depths of her soul," "leaving her as vulnerable as a fresh rose on a spring morning." 'Francesca, the time for words has passed.' "Lance lowered his face onto hers," "and the moment arrived as he pressed his lips against her virgin buds." [Leslie] And so when the patient came for a checkup, I had a suspicion that she'd be allergic to penicillin. And, Pa, you know what penicillin is like, right? [Speaking Chinese] Oh, so early. Must be full moon tonight. Yeah, a full moon. Yeah. No, Hock, please, don't. Don't... don't start. No please don't! [Screaming] Hey, don't make so much noise. Come and eat, Mui. Papa, I told you, it's Isabelle. - Isabelle. - Oh, why so early? - Half past 6:00. - Hey, Beng. - And then? - Well, then after that, the next day-- You know what he said? He said-- "Isabelle held her breath as his manhood stiffened against her." What does that mean? His manhood stiffened against her? [Speaking Chinese] Don't talk so much. - What does this mean? - [Mother] You must drink this soup. You got exams coming. - And look at you. You're so skinny. - I'm not skinny. Papa, do you know what Dr. Raju said to me? He said... Hey, Mui, I saw that new Fever show. What a damn show, man. I want to see. Have you seen it yet? - Seen what? - [Hock] The new Fever show. No, I'm too busy. I haven't seen a film in years. - [Speaking Chinese] - [Leslie] Sure. Now, Leslie, you take this. You work so hard. I already told you, I don't need it. - If Beng doesn't want, give me it. - The whole day you do nothing. - And you want it? - I do nothing? I wake up so early to go to work. Okay, okay, I'll take it. I'll take it. [Hock] Hey, Beng, you also should go and see that show. - [Mui] Ma, I want to go and see. - No. Your brother go night school, studying. You, huh? - Why is it so hard for you to call me Leslie? - Your name is Ah Beng. For five years already, you've refused to call me Leslie. Why can't you give me the respect? - Okay, okay, Leslie. - [Mui snickering] Ma, Pa, I've got to go back to the hospital. You see, you always make things bad. What the hell are you talking about? I never-- - Ah, forget it. - Come back! Don't talk to your mother like that. - Pa, can I go to-- - No! [Speaking Chinese] [Hock Panting] - Sorry I'm late. - Why are you so late? - I thought you're not coming already. - Sorry. - My brother came home today. - Oh. How's Beng, huh?

Now I know you sucked tonight, but don't give up just like that. You think it was so easy for me? I had to bust my friggin' ass to get where I am, and it ain't easy.

You know that dance competition? - Yeah? - First prize, $5,000. - With that kind of money, I can buy my motorbike. - Your motorbike again. Why do you always think about your motorbike? Since I was a boy, I've always wanted one. You know, me and my brother had to walk five miles to school every day. [Speaking Chinese] Always fall asleep in class. Since then I swear that I would buy a motorbike when I grow up. Oh. Don't worry. I'm sure one day you get your motorbike. - Hmph. You think so? - Yeah. - Really? - Mm-hmm. Okay, I'll tell you what.

Blow the candles. Hey, don't forget to make a wish. Actually, I have something to tell you all. - You can't tell us your wish. - I'm going for an operation. What operation? How come you never tell us? - What's wrong? Are you sick? - No, nothing's wrong with me. - [Father] If you need money, don't worry. I have. - [Mother] What operation? I want to be a woman.
