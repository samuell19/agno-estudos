The Cinemateca's program for December, is a series of Uruguayan films from this year. It consists of the most important domestic productions to have been commercially released in recent months. There's also some of Cinemateca's favorite programmes. including Italian cinema from the 1960s, and classics of silent cinema. But undoubtedly, the highlight this month at the Cinemateca, is the retrospective on the work of the great Portuguese filmmaker, Manoel de Oliveira. Cinema was just 12 years of age, when on December 11, 1908, Manoel de Oliveira saw for the first time the light of Porto. We're celebrating 100 years since this great filmmaker's birth. His works are original, complex, personal and beyond trends. ...pretty complicated. We're trying... to fix the projectors in Room 2. And... We've found a bunch of.... ...of unforseen problems. A number of parts need to be replaced, there's image and sound adjustments. - Yeah. - Will it be done before the next season? ...before the next newsletter? How about the projector? - Does it need calibration? - Not particularly... They're all off... it's a mess. They have their wear, right? Yeah. I looked at them the other day. It seems the rollers are tight. Maybe there's other issues too. - Compressors? - Yes. Yes... The film thread is off-line, all kinds of problems. One of the Russians up there.... Not the cosmonauts... the projectors up there... - Yeah... yeah... - ...in the attic. I'm not sure they will work in that room. The lenses. - they could be problematic? - Right. They're for short distances, right? It's not the focus, they have no light. That's right. Is it a quartz light, or...? They require special bulbs. - Xenon? - No, no. Russian bulbs. They require a voltage that we don't use. And there's a limited stock of them. The projector is new, maybe adapting a lamp? - It'll cost more than $15.000. - Maybe. I think the telegram we received is important. It's another telegram regarding our 8-month rent delinquency. What I think is... We should inform the Foundation about it. If you want I can contact Iriarte Jr. and schedule a meeting. We should prepare a report on the state of things. Include the debts, amounts past due, film rights... Will you prepare the report? Well, yes. I can do a draft... and we'll look into it at the next board meeting. The sooner the better. Maybe next week... How long will it take to make the new parts? Well, that's a bit relative... The time it takes the turner to do things is... ...flexible. At least a couple of weeks. What will we do with the room? There's a risk of being unable to show films in the meantime. We can do either of two things: Not to have shows those days... ...when the equipment is being repaired, or resort to other... other formats, like 16mm or digital. - Alejandra... - Yes. Do you have the membership figures for March? 4,783. - 83? - Yes. April? 4,330. May? 3,687. And June? 3,254.

The show for lovers of great cinema. We have a special show today... about an important topic: The spectator's education. Joining us today, is our director: Martínez. He will discuss how the Cinemateca has addressed this task of educating... ...of somehow cultivating... an audience of cinephiles. Martínez... Let's see... People think knowing about film is being able to memorize the works of an actor, director or producer. In such cases they confuse erudition... ...the dictionary with its contents. It's may well be important to know... the great film auteurs careers, but not as a memory exercise, or as superfluous trivia. That's the first thing important to distinguish. Cinema is neither... a collection of cards nor a collection of trivia. Trivia tends to conceal reality. Ultimately, what trivia does is to consolidate, to crystallize information, and nothing else. It is more difficult to... understand... ...how the enrichment of the spectator occurs. It certainly occurs through... accessing and viewing film works, creative works. And how do you... How do you explain the way it echoes in a spectator... Maybe we could call them... an educated spectator, but that's the wrong term. It's an alert, sensitive spectator. Let's say... Alexander Nevsky's Battle of the Ice Sergei Eisenstein's movie with music by Sergei Prokofiev. What we have is... an apparently cold, formal exercise, where the camera doesn't move but there seems to be motion, and there are 6 or 7 lines of melody, from Shostakovich, I mean Prokofiev composition, and the relationship between the framing of each image. To such extent that, if you compare the music sheet... and its movements to the images, the movements coincide. This is to explain how it is made and why that sequence... has such an overwhelming impact on the spectator. It is explained in that manner. But when the fifes kick in for instance, there's a relationship... of who is at that time... getting the spectator's attention. They underline and magnify that tension. All of this is impossible to perceive in a first viewing, as you don't see Citizen Kane's structure in a first viewing. This isn't erudition at all. It's putting a finger on certain things such as the structure of a cinematic work... the same as with a novel, a sculpture or a music composition. What does it mean? It means a film is not just telling a plot, but what the plot motivates... Certain film expressions which ultimately... will either move the spectator or not. OK, we'll be right back with... here on the Cinemateca's show on Capital Radio, discussing these interesting topics and we'll also talk about the programme at the Cinemateca's for this month. Gorostiza? How are you? Yes. Should I read it? In eviction proceedings initiated by Benitez & Benitez Associates against the Cinemateca requested by the plaintiff, and under this court decision as such, I require eviction of the property located at Baldomir 2429 within a period of 10 days. You've also been given 10 days to file an appeal, but we've been unable to notify you in person, in spite of attempts to contact you at your domicile, You are therefore hereby served this notice. Yes, that's what it says. - Hello. - Hello. We've met with the rest of the Foundation members, in an unscheduled meeting, because the situation is truly critical. You may have noticed, we've reduced our support for the Cinemateca as of late. Since we began supporting Cinemateca 10 years ago... we've tried to accommodate and satisfy all of your requests. The situation has now changed, and the Foundation needs to make a decision that we regret. It's a decision we've been considering for some time, and now we are forced to implement it. We won't be able to support the Cinemateca, as we can no longer support cultural institutions that are not economically profitable. I... I repeat, it is in spite of me, and other members of the Foundation. Unfortunately, we will not continue to support... the Cinemateca since it is not... a profitable project from a financial point of view.

Here. Hello, Law School? Criminal Law Department please. Criminal Law Department? I need to speak to Paola Galván please. Hello, Paola? Jorge here, from the Cinemateca. Sure, fine. Look... I wanted to know if you had class today. Ah. Sorry. No. No... they didn't say anything. What time you get out? 9:00? OK. I'm sorry again. Hello, papa? Yes. Yes, everything's fine. Any news? Good. And... papa... don't expect me for dinner, okay? No... I have things to do. Fine. I have to go now, papa. Yes. Yes. Ciao papa. STATE UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW - Thanks. - You're welcome. Excuse me. Are you the substitute teacher? Yes. Lying is universal. Lying is universal. We all lie. We all must lie. The wise thing is to lie with a good end in mind. We must lie to ensure that others profit. In other words, we must lie charitably... ... humanely. We must lie frankly, squarely. With the head held high. We must not lie out of self interest or out of cruelty. We must not lie... ...haltingly or tortuously. We must not lie as if ashamed of our lying. Lying is noble. Let's rid the world of the truth that is rotting it. Lying shall make us great, and good... ...and beautiful. We're worthy dwellers on a planet where even Nature lies. But I am a new, feeble student in this gracious art. I cannot instruct this fine society. Let us lie, but knowingly. Lying is an inescapable law. But let us know when to lie and when not to lie. Who can tell when to lie is fitting or it must be avoided? This law is inescapable. Lying may only be performed thoroughly by a association such as yours... ...composed of people... whose long professional experience... ...proves them masters in the art of lying. You can't do that. Come this way, please. This way, please. - Good afternoon. - Afternoon. - A trim? - Yes. What do you think? Yes, yes. Perfect. - How much is it? - 200 pesos. - Here you go. - Thanks a lot. Paola. Jorge? - What's up? - How are you? I wondered if you were free to go to the movies. The movies? Yes. - OK, I'll call you. - OK. Now. Now? Yes. All right. Let's go.
