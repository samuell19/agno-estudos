There's no assumptions should be safe, right? And Ethiopian, that's fine. Oh yes, I think it's perhaps even better, not really? Bravo! the Ethiopian - very well. And above all, you document well, dig in detail, which is on the whole well. - All ... You believe not that ... - Go! Good luck, be stubborn, it always pays. Then, go to happy holidays. - Thanks, you too. - Come on! Come on! - What was the other? - Nothing, it's mouth, he said another word. - Really? How did you do? - Excuse me ma'am. - Arturo! Arturo! - Mrs! Mrs! You can not go there with the suitcases. - No, but God, a minute! - No, no, you must first register. - In a minute! - I tell you it's not possible! You have a boarding pass at least? Now we will make breadcrumbs rubbing crackers. - It seems to please you, the kitchen. - Oh, I like that. Mind you, I like what I do too. But, it would have pleased me to have a restaurant. - You did not? No. My mother wanted me to do studies and then I got married. My wife, that he would not like it either. - Conard. - You can hold me? - Already iconographer, she finds that it is not very ... - Not so what? - Not very. Sahirya? - What did you tell him that? - What you talking about? - I dunno. It was just to try like that. - But this is what language? - This is the aca. It is a language ... an old language. - Ah, because now more he speaks an old language? - Maybe, I dunno ... Excuse month, huh? For later on. But I believe that with the newsagent you're wrong. - Yes that's it. But explain to me rather the story ??? Really? Because you do mariole and I want to look like a fool! So, it is Ethiopian or not? - It is Ethiopian? - I do not know, I'm not 100 percent but ... - Hey, you should have seen the head of my editor, "it is Ethiopian"! - Oh, loose us with that. - But ... - But to be sure, we should consider a lot of things - migration, sédentarisations ... - Well what? - Sedentary, those set in a place not move. In Ethiopia there's hundreds of ethnic groups. Scattered everywhere. Each with their own language and then sometimes words that are common to them, as Vayu and sahirya. - Souhirya. - Well, it looks good walk your little couple. - What was the other there? It is completely in waxing. We offer a small glass, Mr. roan. - Really? What has? - I dunno. Tired overdrive. - I'll put you (kneeling) me, you'll see. You, you'd better keep you checked unless you have time to spare. Well, for you it is arranged, this is it. - Me? - Yes, we found your father. - Where is he? He will come? - Oh no, it would be hard ... He was deported on 20 December, the day that happened to you, say so. It's stupid, huh? Do you cross - Forced out? - How you expelled? - Expelled at his home in Guinea. Clandestine, no license and then hop ... ejected. You know we had a terrible time finding it, your father? And it was not a technician, he was area technician. Nuance - sweeper. - luis And then? Needless to stay, him? - Stay? Why stay? Tomorrow morning there's a flight to Conakry at 10 am, we put them in and that's it. So he will fuck more mess in the area. Enjoy good of your Eve. - Well, you see see your father, you're not happy? Finally it is normal, you want to live without your parents. There and you here, this is not possible. - I see why. You do not you live with your parents? - It has nothing to do, you know, not an idiot. - Especially ... if not before he found his parents, he may end up like us but to Conakry airport. - You speak! To find Balandou ... Conakry they (not even know what that is), Balandou. - If it's just for him to change from the airport? Frankly it is better here. - If I leave, I will not fly. I will be nothing. I want to stay in Paris, me. I also want to be sedentary. - There too you can learn if you go to school. My father there he was at school. And? Did you see? - That's Mr. Conti. - Yes. - And in addition he received phone calls in person now. He thinks that him?

You were talking to him, I saw everything. - You saw me? And why did not you call me? - I called you! You've not heard, you were very busy. Who is it? - But it's nothing, it's people who are just like me, stranded. - Stop, stop with your stories. - Listen, Susan, this is not the time, really. You should have to go to Paris, I told you. - For you to be alone with her? That's it? Really?

It was an Italian dish. You will appreciate. - No thanks. - To you all this? - It's her, it was Christmas. - It's not like that, Paris is not in order. - How is it? - Oh, you already have the Sacred Heart there. but behind it is a little high. - Why height? - Because it is on a small hill. Called Montmartre, which is higher than everything else. Here, like this. - I miss the Eiffel Tower anyway. - Yes, a lot less. - This is how high? - Well, I do not know, me. It is on a hill. After... you got Notre Dame. It is on an island of the City. And then in the Rue de Rivoli ... and then the Place de la Concorde. With the obelisk. - The what? - The obelisk is a trick Napoleon robbed the Egyptians. Here. Viewing. And now you got the Champs Elysees. It goes up a little, not too much. And up you have the Arc of Triomphe and the Place de l'Etoile. Pass me the box there. The Opera. And that, of course. This is Madeleine. And there, behind, yes, the Grands Boulevards. Ah! And then the Montparnasse tower, I must not forget it. - And the Eiffel Tower, where is the Eiffel Tower? - Oh, that ... The Eiffel Tower not you going to miss it, it's Mom. It monitors all she is ... She's there. - And the Seine, you did not put with the riverboats. - LA Seine. I already told you, not listening to you. - But it's A River. - Yes, but finally told LA Seine. - ??? Seine in the middle, it's everywhere. - You see? She turns. - And the riverboats, they pass over. - Like small ships. - And if you went there? - What do you mean? - If you showed him these riverboats? - What? You want to get out of the airport? - Well yes, they are not here. - It will not, head, huh? - Tonight or never, right? Non? - Come on, we'll get rid of all that. - But what? It's Christmas Eve, there's nobody. More customs, more cops. Tonight everyone cares. Let him see Paris at least once. - Well, at that time they are closed, the riverboats. - Not at all, they walk at night, especially at night because of the lights. You see see tonight there are lights everywhere in Paris. - That's enough now. If we had to go out, it would be done long ago. you we would not have waited. Leave us alone. - Sounds a little air of good, right? - I do not care about the air! You know what they risk ??? on the territory? Oh, of course, do not care, you.

Go for it. - There is nothing. Leave me alone. - But if it's wrong? - Yes, yes, it's going very well. I look at the Seine, that's all. It cares dark thoughts. But it's nothing, it will pass. It's the memories that go back. And the stuff I could have done and I did not. Finally, that's life. - Must not stop going like that must react.
