MARYLINE (Based on real events) Hey, come here. How did it go? Okay. See. Very good. This is great. Show it to your mother. As of today, the couponing is over. Carlito. Bring the tools from the shed to the road. Yesterday I checked, there are no problems. It's nice. Look at this one. With padding. I do not use pads. Why. You have a nice padding body. Do you wear pads? No. Then? But we have to be challenging. I'm against ironing. Oh... I do not know. Markito, come help your mother to choose a gender. What do you think? No, it is not. This one? Ah, you have a taste. Give her a try. Fresh. For the summer. Don't you have something a little more classic? This is the latest fashion, Olga. Come on, give it a try. They are very modern now. And this one to add. Yes please. Something else? No. You're always lazy. My feet hurt. Don't listen to him. He just gets stuck with you. You will support us all. You will see. Open to unload. Five cows were stolen from our farm. Everything was in blood. Big mess. The fence was cut at the padlock from the road. They must have come from there. Do you have any cartridges? Just a few. Fakundo, bring the cartridges. You have to be on your guard, Carlos. Yes. Okay. But let your boys help you. I spoke to Hector, Marcos. You can travel with them.

I'll buy some things, Yeya. Two pounds of yerba. Something else. Up to two pounds of sugar. And two rice. Don't they teach you not to steal? Where are you going? And two pounds of flour. You owe me. Do you like? That. It is a gift. By whom? You didn't tell me. Faku. Close your eyes again. Bye. Bye. Are you okay? You have to cut your hair. Very short. When you get home, you will cut my hair. Where the hell are the cartridges. Look, they're not in the kitchen. Father. Let me see. Are you leaving now, Marquitos? Huh? Don't make yourself shy. Come on, get off. Get off.

I think it's a good opportunity. Your little one can get started with computers. I keep an eye on the children. Do not worry. I talked to Augustine and his family. They have been farmers for many years. They know the job very well. Others would lower the price because of lost animals and you will not be able to pay. The boys can no longer.
