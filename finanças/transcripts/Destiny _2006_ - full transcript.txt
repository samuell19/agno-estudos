Good morning. I thought of taking some of these carpets without waking you up. We're thinking of buying something like this for the living room. Is your living room large? I don't know. From here to there, I think. Let me spread this one for you. So that you can estimate. - Ooww! What did you do? - Nothing. This is really funny. How much is it? 500 million, but we can work something out. - Like what? - I mean a discount. Discount or not, it's too expensive. - How about that one? - 850 million. What's the difference? They look almost the same. Different quality. It's tighter and more beautiful. - See this one, too if you like. - Let me see. I can't see the difference. - Maybe you can't, but this one is better. - Nonsense. - Are you the owner of this place? - Kind of. It's my father's; I'm just running it. Good, appreciate it. Well, I'm leaving. I'm very late. - What's your name? - Bekir. And I'm Ugur. Nice to have met you. I may come back with my mother. Will that be okay? - Sure. Bye. - Good-bye. Bekir! Bekir! Bekir! - What is it mother? - Are you deaf, son? - Your friends are whistling down there. - All right, I'm coming. All right, I'm coming. - Don't hang out till midnight. - OK. Kudret, bring the tea faster or I'll kiss you. You come kiss mine. Take it out and I'll kiss it, you fag! - You are the fag! - Beat it boy! - What's it to you, man? - Fuck off. - Kudret, honey! - What the hell are you doing? Why don't you all pick on someone your size? All right, son. Don't push it. - Who ordered "oralet"? - It's Muzo's. - What's wrong Kudret? - What's it to you? - How's it going, Kudret? - Fine. What happened? What happened? - Kamil grabbed him again. - Is that so? Hey, Kamil! Didn't I tell you not to mess with the kid? I was just fooling around with the fag. You are the fag, bastard! Why do you mess with a little kid? Cevat, he didn't do anything. Now you say he didn't do anything? Who grabbed my ass? Stop it! Go mind your business... Kamil. This'd better be the last. Swear to God I didn't say anything. I've got witnesses. Does the boy make it up? He doesn't blame anyone but you. What's bugging you? Are you his father? Yes, I am! If you send him to the coffehouse, they'll touch him everywhere. Let me hear that again if you dare. Come on! Cevat's gonna fuck Kamil someday. Hey, there's this girl, Ugur. Do you know her? What about her? - She came to the store today. - Why? She wanted to buy a carpet. Dude, I was afraid you banged her. Behave yourself! Why not? You're the only one who hasn't banged her. - Don't get involved with her kind. - Why? Why? Cevat is eating her and her mother, but the bitch is really fucking Zagor, who's more of a psycho than Cevat. - Isn't he out ofjail yet? - No, not yet. God knows, she's a sweet one. Have you tasted her, too? - Well, you could say that. - "You could say that". Bullshit! That's where she lives. The one with the lights on. - Well, we'd better go. Good night. - Good night. - Good night. - Good night, see you tomorrow. How are you? Fine. How are you, brother Sevket? Fine, you're fine... Look, I brought you cigarettes. Is there anyhing else you want? If you need anything, just send word with Kudret. Well, go on resting now... - Have you given him cigarettes again? - What happened? Don't leave these by him. He's going to burn himself. Get some sleep; you've been around all day. Kudret will not work at the coffeehouse from now on. If they call him, tell them to talk to me first. What the hell did you do this time? I haven't done anything. That fag, Kamil, grabbed me. And you ask what the hell I did? Whatever. - He'll hang out with me from now on. - Which bastard grabbed you? That bastard, Kamil. He should go grab his mother. I'll show him! Don't get involved in this. - What's it to you? - Ugur! - What? - I'll tear your mouth apart! - Let's see how... - Stop it already! Kudret, can you bring those bags? - Go check the tea. - I've just checked it. Move it, girl, move it! Kudret, this is yours... This is yours. This is for Ugur. And this is for brother Sevket. - You've spent a lot again. - Nevermind. Hello there! Helloooo! - Don't you ever stay awake? - I wasn't sleeping. - I left an envelope here. - It's here. - Thank you, bye. - Bye. THE PRISON IN ISTANBUL Where the hell are you? I've asked you where you are. Which friend's house? Just tell me. Cevat, don't lie to me. I know you're home. Who's the woman that came to the store today? Cevat, I swear on the life of my children, I'll kill you. Bastard! Sister, mom's leaving. - Mom! - Get out of my way. Mother, you'll embarrass yourself. Ugur, don't get involved in this. You don't have the right to shame us. - Whore! Who do you think you are? - Mom... It's enough! Don't get involved. I'll kill that bastard. I'm fed up with you. Wretched whore! What are you saying? Whore! What the hell are you doing? Get lost! Don't interfere, you retard! Son of a bitch. I'll make you pay for all of these, I'll disgrace you to the whole world... Shut up already, shut up, shut up! You can't do anything, you can only shame yourself. What a contemptible woman you are... Shame on you... Look what you've done to yourself for a bastard. If you don't care about us, think of the one inside. He is your husband, father of your children. Bekir! Bekir, son! What? How's your head? Aching the same. Cemil and Muzaffer asked about you. They said Hakan was coming, too. - You should have told them I was sleeping. - I did. - So? - Come sit on the balcony for a while. It's so nice out there. I'll make you some tea. No, I'll just get some sleep. Okay, son. Mom, is dad inside? No. He asked about you then went out. - I'll go upstairs and visit Zeliha. - Okay. How are you? - Son, I've asked you how you are. - I'm fine, dad. - Has something happened? - No. - If there's anything, don't hesitate to tell me. - There's nothing, dad. Stay here for a while; your mother wants to speak with you. Well, I'm gone. - Good-bye. - Good-bye. He was sad to see you like that yesterday night. Keep it for today. - What's this? - The daughter of your father's friend. - So? - Your father said you should think about it. What's up? - Sleeping on foot this time! - No, I just dozed off. - Who's that? Your lover? - Come in. I was just passing by and wanted to see how you are. You didn't like it, I guess. What a bashful man you are. People wouldn't take you for a salesman. Hello! This is a funny place. You really didn't like this. Sorry. I'd better leave. Good-bye. Ugur... What is it? What is it? I love you so much... The heat wave will bring record-breaking temperatures. The temperature is reaching 34 degrees in Istanbul. Get ready for the hottest weekend of the summer. - Hey, waiter! See to us! - Yes? A glass of tea, please. - Would you like one, uncle? - I'll have one. And one for the uncle. - Do you want anything else? - No. I'll wash the dishes and come back. Allright. - How are you, Ugur? - Fine. Where are you going? - I'm bored. I'll take a walk. - You'll be back, right? I'll be back, don't worry. - Kudret, you're almost there. - Shut up! - Come on, try harder. - Shut up! - Come on, boy! - Cut it off! - Hey! What the fuck? - Motherfucker! I'm gonna fuck your mother! Son of a bitch! What do you think you're doing? You grabbed me! I'm gonna fuck your mother! Son of a bitch! What do you think you're doing? Stop it! Don't interfere or I'll fuck your mother, too! Kudret! Kudret! - Let go of me! - What happened? - Let go! - Has Kamil done something? I'm gonna fuck Kamil! I'm gonna fuck you, too. Cevat, you're making a mistake. I haven't done anything. Kudret and that kid got in a fight. I just intervened. - There are lots of witnesses. - Step outside! Swear to God I didn't do anything. They were fighting, and I got in between. Cevat, I just intervened. Stop, all of you! I'll fuck anyone who interferes. I haven't done anything. - Shut up, jerk! - Brother, I haven't done anything! Leave the kid alone. Zagor, don't interfere. Take Kamil outside. What happens if I interfere? I told you not to! Pull the trigger, jerk! Pull it! Pull it! Cevat's friends sent you some stuff. - Cevat's friends, huh? - Yes. - You didn't have to... - No problem. He wants a cigarette. - Shall I give him one? - Yes, you can. We've collected this among friends. We'll be happy if you'd accept it. Thank you, but... which friends of Cevat? - From the neighbourhood. - Don't you know them? I know them but not closely. Why have they sent you? I was just passing by, and I thought I'd drop it off. Did they tell you that you, too, should taste me? What? The tea got cold. Enough is enough. Don't push it. I'm sorry for what I've just said, but you didn't have to lie. - Why should I lie? - You know the answer to that. All I know is that those bastards wouldn't give anyone anything for free. - Do you know Kemal? - Yes, I do. He was Cevat's closest friend. He sent me word asking if I needed anything. I asked him for a favor for my husband's hospital stuff. He said we needed to meet, then fucked me by force. He even didn't keep his promise after he was finished. Do you get it? That's the story. With your permission, I'll leave now. Of course. Any news from Ugur? None... - Good-bye. - Good-bye. - Welcome. - Thanks. - How are you? - I'm fine. Shall we go to your mother's after dinner? - Nothing to do there. - Your mother's putting pressure on me. She kept nagging me at the hospital today. We'll visit them some other time. How's the baby? They said all was O.K., and the baby seemed to be fine. - They'll take a sonogram tomorrow. - Good. Now, the news about the killing of two police officers in Izmir. The officers, while following a lead called into the Police S.O.S. Line, were attacked by Orhan Kara, also known to the police as "Zagor Orhan". The police officers, whose throats were cut, could not be saved. The officers were following a lead called into the Police S.O.S. Line in Izmir when they arrested Orhan Kara and his lover, Ugur Demir. The police had been looking for Orhan Kara, a murder suspect... Hey, be quiet! Taking advantage of their momentary confusion, he attacked two police officers with a box-cutter. - What happened? - What do you mean? - You were staring. - Nothing. Welcome. - I hope you're okay. - Thank you. Come inside if you want; you should be cold. Why don't you come in? Have a seat. Let me order some tea for you; it'll warm you up. When did you arrive? Last night. Did they keep you long at the police station? Ten days. Did they do anything to you? I can't say that they did. But they really roughed Orhan up. Two of their fellow officers were killed... Sorry, I didn't mean it that way. Wanna smoke? What's going to happen now? As he's caught red-handed, he'll be charged immediately. It won't take long before he gets a life sentence. - What? - What? - I thought you were making fun of me. - Oh, no. I was a bit surprised. You've learned this business well. Which business? This business. Underground stuff. Cases, courts, etc. - What happened? - Nothing. Well, I'd better not keep you from your work. I've come here to thank you for what you've done for my family. I just delivered what had been collected. I don't know why you're doing this, but I know that Cevat's friends never give anyone anything. Good-bye! - I need money. - Why? I'll hire a lawyer for Orhan. He killed three people right in front of everybody. What can a lawyer do in a case like this? I can'tjust leave him like that. - How much do you need? - 5 billion. - That's a lot of money. - Give me whatever you can spare. Don't you think it's a bit unfair when your family's in such need? Please! I know all of this. Just tell me that you can't do it. I know what I'm doing. - Will you go to Izmir when you find the money? - Yes. How are you going to pay it back? I'll do it somehow. I'll do anything. I'll become a whore. I'll be your mistress, if you want. Do you love him that much? 2,3,4... - How are you, aunt Sukran? - I'm fine, Bekir. Good. What else can we do other than being fine? We'll be fine for sure; we'll be fine. - How's it going, Body? - Fine, bro. Where are you going? - To have some soup. Wanna come? - I can't leave this place brother. Hey, come on, where's everyone? We've been waiting for Ugur. What's the rush? Here I am. Good night, Body. - Good evening, brother Irfan. - Good evening. Bekir, don't be late watching TV. Want a joint? I'll roll it myself. No, thanks. I've just had one. What's this, brother? Nothing. I'm just staring. I must run. Look at what I've bought for you. Is it nice? Very nice. Very nice. What are those? Underwear. Undershirts and underpants. Are they yours? Why would I give them to you, if they were mine? Nice, thanks. Mine are all worn out. - What did you get for Zagor? - Same stuff. He has a backache, so I got him a set of wool underwear. Good. - Is tomorrow visiting day? - Yes. The week has passed by so quickly. Yes. Time flies. Let me get some sleep. I have to wake up early. - You go to your room. - Okay. I'll brush my teeth. - Where have you been? - I was taking a walk. - What are you doing? - I'm getting ready. I'm late. What's wrong? Come here! Let me go! Fuck off, bastard! He's really going insane! Animal! Is everything allright? I can't sleep. Thanks, bro. - Aren't you getting out? - No. - What's wrong? - Nothing. I just feel down. - Why? - No reason. Hey Bekir! Aren't you coming? Get some air; it may help. Bekir, - I want you to go to Istanbul for a while. - What happened? - Nothing. - So, why? - Don't object right away. - Why should I object? I just don't understand why. You would also see your wife and child. - Has something happened? - For once, why don't you do as I say? Have I said I wouldn't do it? - Okay then. - Okay. - Is this all you've wanted to say? - Yes. Let's close the subject then. When will you go? Hey, Bekir! Aren't you coming? What did you say? I asked you when you'd go. Want me to go now? Don't play games with me! Whatever it is, tell me! I've talked with Kudret this morning. My father is not well. I have this bad feeling... Allright. I'll go tomorrow morning. - That man. - Okay. What is it, brother? - Are you Bekir? - Yes, is anything wrong? This is what's wrong! - Emine! - Just a minute, mother. I'll put the baby to sleep. Here. Hush now, this is not the time to cry. Nedim... What's up? We're gonna shoot some pool. Wanna come? Sure. I'll be right there. Hello? I'm working. Fine, I won't be late. Come here, sweetie. There's a package in the bag. Can you bring it? See what mother's bringing. - What's this? - What have you been doing, huh? See what daddy's got for you. - Your dinner's ready. - Thanks. Come on, open it! Do you know what's gonna come out? A little teddybear! Take it. Do you like it? - It's getting cold. - Yes. I'll put the kid to bed. - Will you wake father up? - Yes. - Dinner's ready. - I won't eat. - Aren't you hungry? - I'm not. Bekir, what's going on? What? Don't be a smart ass. It's enough already. What do you want from the poor girl? You left her when you were married for only 4 months. When she gave birth, you weren't a father to your child. I've never heard her complain about anything. She's never been disrespectful. She's an honorable woman. It can't go on like this, Bekir. I haven't said anything to you until now. Like when you bankrupted the store. But it's enough. You don't have the right to hurt anyone. Go and apologize. And don't do these things again and again. Is that understood? Okay. - Don't! - I will! - Don't! - I will! - Don't dear! - I will! Stop! Bekir... Bekir, what do you want? Where will this take us? - Wherever it takes us. - What do you mean by "wherever"? I can't make it without you. - Let's go back to Istanbul. - What happens when we go back? I'll make it up to dad; I'll work hard again. We can marry, if you want. I'll rent a place. I'll look after you and your family. I'll look after Zagor, too. You can always go and visit him. Bekir, you're talking nonsense. You think you're Cevat. - These things won't happen. - Why not? - I'll never go back to Istanbul. - But why? - Because I won't. - What about your family? I don't care. - Will you be a whore for the rest of your life? - Yes, I will. - But why? - There's no reason. - How can that be? - No reason! I want it that way. - But what you want is bad. - Then I want what's bad. - Allright then. I'll stay here. - I don't want it. Have I ever harmed you? I don't like you Bekir. What have I done to you? That's not important. I just don't want it. This can't go on like this. This will hurt your pride. - Go back before it gets worse. - Don't give me advice. I'm not. I'm telling you what's going to happen. Besides, what about Zagor? He'll get you killed this time. - It's not that easy. - Have you forgotten what happened before? Is it worth hurting your family? How about you? Do you have any idea how your family lives? - You're chasing that psychopath... - It's none of your business. He killed the man who protected your family... ...for some worthless bugger. That pedophile, Kamil, is fucking your brother now. His friends are fucking your mother. And you're whoring for the man responsible for all of these. - Fuck off, jerk! - You fuck off! Fucking whore! If our paths cross again, I swear to God I'll have you shot. - In the head! - Fuck off... Fuck off or I'll break your nose! Hello, mom? I'm fine, mom. Thanks. How are you? Oh, no. I'm at the hotel. I've just woken up. For God's sake mom; don't start again. Okay, okay, I'll come. I said okay. Say hello to dad. Bye. Ismail? - Yes, sister? - Take this imbecile out of here. - Just a minute. - Come on. I'll say something to the whore and leave. - What are you going to say? - It's between us. Get out of my way, call the whore for me! Hey bitch! Where are you, whore? You screwed up my life! You took my life away! Where are you, bitch? Don't come near me! Cut it off! Are you the guardian of this place? Asshole! Fuck off! What the hell are you talking about? Brother Mehmet, this has nothing to do with you. What are you saying, huh? Asshole! What are you saying? - Don't you dare come here again. - Please don't. Brother Mehmet, that's enough. Throw him out! Get out! Go to your table! Fuck off! - Body! What the hell are you doing? - Fuck! I'm gonna fuck this pain! Man, give it to me. - Gimme a smoke. - Bekir, I said give it to me! - Give me a cigarette. - Whatever! Don't you have a Turkish brand? Justjoking! - Give it to me. - My brother offers Marlboro. - How have you been? - Always the same, pal. - How's business? - The same. I've worked till morning. You haven't been around for a long time. I'm huffed dear Body. I resent your low-life boss, that faggot, Ismail. And that whore, Ugur. By the way, how's Ugur? Still whoring? I guess you don't know. Miss Ugur left for Sinop. Body, don't pull my leg. I swear she's gone. It's been about fifteen days. - Body, are you serious? - I swear, man. Ask Ismail, if you don't believe me. When the warden didn't accept Zagor's requests, Zagor and his friends started an uprising at the prison and killed two of his enemies. Zagor was wounded, too. As soon as he was discharged from the hospital, he was transferred to the Sinop prison. Two days later, Ugur went after him. She left some money for you. She said you should stop hurting people, and go back to your home and family. Good day! I'd like to see Miss Ugur. There is no Miss Ugur here. I understand, but this is an emergency. Please tell her I'm here. T's a matter of life and death. Let me go take a look. Wait here. - She's not there. - Please don't do this. Come on, brother. Go and call her. I know she's in her room. - Move it! - Let me go! Ugur! Ugur, answer me... Answer me for God's sake! I'll say a couple of words. I promise. I'm a fag, if I don't leave... Ugur, please show some mercy... Ugur, come out! Ugur, come out! I'm done for, ruined. Ugur, please come out! Please come out or I'll die. Wherever you are, come out! I'll just say a few words. This is the fag! - Is this him? - Yes. What do you want, jerk? I didn't come here looking for trouble. - So, you think this will scare me. - Don't come near me or I'll cut you. Allright, brother Mahmut. He's my brother. I'll handle this. You've got half an hour. - Then you get the fuck out of here. - Okay, brother Mahmut. Talk to me now! Talk! - Talk, you jerk! - Ugur, don't do this. Don't you see what you've done to me and to yourself? Don't you have any pride, you jerk? Aren't you a man, huh? - Ugur... - Fuck your Ugur! How long has it been? How many times have we talked? What's left to say, you jerk? I can't live without you... Where the hell are we? The bugger gave me these directions. Fuck! We're really lost. Don't panic, brother. We'll find it somehow. How are we gonna find it? Screw my luck! Take it easy, brother. We'll find a way. The place is deserted, don't you see? Incredible! - 55 million. - Okay. Here you go. My respects. Mission complete. Go! Stop, brother! Stop here! - What happened? - Stop forjust a minute. - Let me buy you a glass of raki. - For goodness sakes! Your family's waiting for the pills. - Please... - I still have work to do. - I'm not finished yet. - Well, up to you. - I'll have a drink. - What's this? Isn't this your father's cab? Take it! Don't make me start with the father! - At least don't be too late. - Wish you good business. - Thank you, uncle. - Enjoy! I'll have another shot. - Hey, how's it going? - Fine. How about you? Thank you, uncle. - Hey, man... - Ooo, brother Bekir? What's up? All O.K. I'll be right back. - We're waiting for you. - O.K. You are... - Here's a joint. - Thanks. Thanks, man. Fuck this shit! Two bottles of medication cost 55 million. - Here, brother. - Is it my turn? Brother, how's sister Ugur doing? - Do you still see her? - She's fine. Hanging around. The last time we heard, she was in Isparta. That was a long time ago. She's in Kars now. She's Bekir's main lady. My brother is a married man but Ugur is the story of his life, and it's even bigger than the story of Romeo and Juliet. Brother Bekir has taken bullets and has cheated death for her. Wrists have been cut; months have passed in hospitals; years in mental wards. There isn't a town that he hasn't been to, and a single road that he hasn't walked on for Ugur. Isn't it true, brother Bekir? All lies! Who's making these stories up? - Everybody says so. - Screw the fags! Who's after her? Then tell us the true version. Let's hear it. I was running the store then. We used to sell carpets. One day, I fell asleep in the store. I opened my eyes and this whore was there like a Turkish delight. No stockings, just a skirt to her knees, a silky blouse, her hair all done. She asked the prices and tried to make fun of me. I said nothing. She asked me if I was married, I still didn't say anything. I was a gentleman then, but there's a limit to decency. I nicely said: "Come on, take your leave." She didn't. I pushed her inside; gave it to her real hard. I made her scream. I fucked her so hard! The more she screamed, the more I felt like a conqueror. - Are you starved? - No. You'll have to do with the breakfast stuff. Drink this while I'm setting the table. It'll warm you up. - Are you sick? - No. - You seem to have a fever. - No. I'm fine. What's in the plastic bag? Medication. - Bekir, are you sick? - No, it's for something else. Why didn't you take some warm clothes? - How was your trip? - Fine. - Was it cold? - A little. It's freezing out there. We've been sick for some time. What's her name? Cilem. I hoped for a boy, but... Have you and your husband made up? I heard you'd stabbed him. He wouldn't dare not to. - He will get a bullet the next time. - Why did you marry him then? I don't know. I thought it would be nice. - But he tried to confine me to the house. - So? We'd talked about everything before. Then he began to boss me around. Meanwhile, Zagor attempted to escape. They transferred him here. I wanted to visit Zagor, but he wouldn't let me. Then he beat me up, and I stabbed him. I came here with the baby. How's it in Istanbul? All the same. - The neighbourhood? - That's the same, too. Your market owner, the hodja, died two months ago. Do you remember Hakan? Of course. He was studying medicine. He died, too. Oh, God! How? Traffic accident. He was going on a vacation. He was so young, about our age... A year younger than me. Hakan, huh? Destiny. Yes, destiny. My dad is dead, too, huh? Don't worry. I learned about it a long time ago. - How did you learn? - Zagor told me. There's a boy in his cell block. Sedat. His father told Sedat when he came for a visit. - Mailman Cabbar's son? - Yes. That's him. - When was he imprisoned? - About a year ago. - He's in he same block with Zagor. - What was his crime? Murder. He stabbed his lover in Ankara. My goodness! He was such a quiet boy. You never know. You can never know who has money and faith. Want one? How's Zagor? Fine. If he could only stay out of trouble. Jerk! The minute he was admitted, he tried to stab the warden. They broke all his bones. He was in solitary for 2 months. He's still recovering. How have you been? As you see. It's a bit hard with the baby, but I'm not complaining. You? - Your family? - They're fine. Look... The boy looks like a monkey, but the girl is beautiful. God bless them. How's your wife? Fine. Thanks to dad, they're all looked after. - Why did you come here? - You know why. - What do you want me to say? - Don't say anything. Just let me stay. I promise I won't interfere. How can I believe you? If I don't keep my promise, you'll throw me out. - What if you cause trouble? - I won't. - What if you do? - I said I wouldn't. If it doesn't work out, I'll shoot myself. Don't talk like a lunatic. Fuck me if I don't. I have pride, too. The last time you almost caused a riot in the whole city of Konya. Don't insult me. That was a long time ago. I still think you should go back. - Don't do this to me. - You shouldn't do this, either. It would even be good for me. But, it wouldn't be fair to you and your family. There is no other way. Fair or unfair... Everything's been considered. I'm ready for everything. Let's say you're doing a favor. Everyone believes in something in this fucking life. And for me, it's you! The other night the kid was sick. He needed medication. I went out to get it. I was trying to find a night-pharmacy. All of a sudden I had this ache in my gut. I missed you so much... On the way back I saw a bar. All I remember is getting inside and starting to drink. Then at least fourjoints... When I opened my eyes, I saw snow-capped mountains. Some guy was telling me that I was in Kars. I got off the bus, and began walking. I asked myself where I was. I found my way here. I stopped at the door and thought. I said to myself: "This is the door to the other world; this is the bridge between heaven and hell. Once you cross it, you cannot go back. Think twice." I thought and thought, but I couldn't go back. Then I said to myself: "There's no other way. Don't resist! This is your destiny. The road is set; bow your head and walk." It's a bit cold in here. We'll work something out tomorrow. - Good night. - Good night. Cilem, my daughter...
