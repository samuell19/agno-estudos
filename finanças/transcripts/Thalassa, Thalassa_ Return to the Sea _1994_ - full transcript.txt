Man, he smokes a cigarette. - Hey, how'd you get the cigarette? - I found it. - Where? - In the car. - Where in the car? - Where I was hiding. - Was that the only one? - I don't know. It was dark. And look what else I found... something... - Where'd you get those? - In the back. - And that's all there was? - Sisi, can I have the glasses? - Fane... - Sisi, aren't I your best friend? - Sisi, give me. - Fane, stop for a minute. - Me, me, Sisi, just for a little bit. - He gives to me, because he is my brother. - Stop it, already. - Stop it at last! Nobody touches it, it's mine. Wait! Hey, Pasa, wait. That's mine, it's all mine. Get off. - Where did you find the glasses? - Look, what's this? Put it down, it's mine. - Show me what you got there. - This belongs to me. What do you want? Leave me alone. Hey, it belongs to me. You do not get. - Give it to me. It's mine. - Fuck off! Everything belongs to me. Give it to me! Let me too. - Sisi! Where are you going? - Sisi, give it to me. Sisi. Give me the gun, Sisi. Come on. Hurry up. He can't see us here. - Can you see anything? - Yeah, he's just sitting there. There he is. Come on, let's go up to him. Sisi, can I have a turn? Swap these, what do you think? Come on, Sisi, if you give me the gun, I'll do a photo of yourself. What do you think? If you give me the gun, I'll give you a suitcase. Hey, Sisi, if you give me the gun, I'll shoot you. No, look what I've got. Give it to me. And here, Sisi, do you like it? Look, look what I have. You get two photos... two photos! Ah, it's you. - How'd you do that? - That's bubblegum. Where'd you get it? Do you have more? Wait, I'll give you the gun. Please, please, give me one. I'll make a photo of you! - Look what I give you for it. - No, keep your stuff. - I do not need nothing. - Then give us chewing gum anyway. - I do not need nothing of your stuff. - Okay, then... No, not my cap! Give it back. No, it's mine, give it back. - Take it, then. - Come here! My cap! It's mine. Give it to me. Give it back. Hey guys, look what I found. Madness, they're all clean. And so many. - Let me see. - This has to be for me. What a great haul. Do you want it? Exchange, we do. I also want shoes. Hey, wait! Put it out, it's too close to her hair. Tell him to stop that rocking. Hey, Fane. Come on, Fane... Forget about it. - Is that better, darling? - Yeah. - Mortu, want a smoke? - Yeah! All right, already, Mortu. Okay. Now what do we do? Quick! Get down. It comes! Caution! - He sees us. - Be quiet! - Look, if you see something. - What should we do now? What are you waiting for? Go! Oh, what the hell. Do you want to help change the wheel? Do I look like a flat tire? A hole in the tire. - Indeed? - Yes. Jan. Go on. Who do you think you are? You old bag of shit. Do it yourself, loudmouth. Mortu. Go on. What are you waiting for? Get moving. Why? Why me again? It's always me, what about the others? Why only me? This is unfair. Just total mess! - Why only me? - Come on, help me. We get out. Here, for you. I hope do you like them. Oh yes. They are really wonderful. - Tomorrow I'll bring you some more. - Yes, thank you. I know a place, there's all the flowers you can imagine. Really? Yes, a huge area with lots of flowers and colorful butterflies. - Can you show me that? - Of course, if it's interesting for you. We have to wait until the tires've been changed. - Fane, are you tired? - A little bit. Let Pasha go to drive. He says he can. Well, if he wants... Hey, Pasha, have you heard? You can drive it! - Why are you staring at me? Will you not? - No. Fane is to drive. I still remember exactly how you said your father let you use his car. Now, really. Show me. Show that you can drive. Exactly. You said to me too. Show that you can drive. Show that you can drive. Darling, you're in the best hands. Show us what you can... Now, get out the way and see. - You're giving it too much gas. - Stalled. Don't hit a tree! Caution, there's a big tree over there! Don't drive so fast. Look at the speedometer! He has no clue about. - This is perhaps stupid idiot. - Pasha, stupid idiot... Pasha, stupid idiot... Watch out for people. There's a tree, look out. We have enough now, buddy. Thank you for the ride. Go on, Fane, we're just wasting time. Come on, Pasa. Come back here. - You okay there, darling? - Yeah, fine. - I'll put some music on for you. - Cool! Well, where do we go now? I'm going to run out of petrol as well. To the east. So... in this direction. Wow, right through the hole. Unbelievable! Okay, Fane, we can go now. Wait a minute, folks. Stop, Fane, don't depart. What does he want? Fane. Did you see what kind he threw in? Did you? It's a real big one. Always hits the target. Two-Nil. - I also want to. - Yes, me too. Give me a rag or something. How about this? Damn, get me a thicker one. Hurry up! Here! Oh, no. Are you completely daft? What the hell are you doing? What are you looking at me like that for? You said you need thicker. Where should we fetch it? I'm hungry. Me too, I'm starving. - Get my bag as well. - Get it yourself. Don't go off, we need water in the radiator. There hasn't been any rain here since Noah. Give me a cigarette, Sisi. Jan, you can have my pear. I don't need that small thing, give it to him. Hey, guys. There's a building over there. Someone has to go and get water. I've seen it there. I'm not going. Draw straws. Okay, we'll draw. Two people can get the water. The rest of us stay here. Jane, give me a match. Two short ones out of seven. Whoever pulls them, go get the water. But it should be out of six, not seven. You should leave her out. Why? She's not pregnant or anything. Are you crazy? To go miles for water? Now, quiet! Give me the matches. Give them to me. Done. Here we go. Who goes first? You, Fane. Long one. Bravo. Well, now it's your turn. - The short one, bad luck. - Well. Who's going with me? Jan. Ah, Pasha. - Jan didn't do it, why is it my turn? - You draw now, understand? - Long. - Have you had luck once again, you moron? Mortu. Also long. So, and now you two. You first, Sisi. You have to take a match! Well, come on, Sisi. Let's go, friends. To work. What are you looking for? It's mine. Stay away from my stuff. Sisi? Can I have your glasses until you get back? Well. But only until 'm back! No looking. Anuta? Yes? Do you know how to do... What do you call it, Fane? What do you mean? When your shoulder's tight? Massage. Yes, massage. Do you want to give me one? Come here if you want. Sure. Yeah, I want one too, me too. Come on, Anuta, come on. Why always me? Always me. Man, that's a feeling. Always me. Why not? Yes. Here also. This is wonderful. Get all the stuff, quick. Where is Sisi? - Don't drink it. - First the car. - Where is Sisi? - We must get out of here. They haunt us. Now we do not even have drinking water. Pack your stuff. Tell me now, where my brother is! We have to get out of here. Do you understand? They haunt us. Come, Rosu, sit down here. To my place, come on. Get in the car. People, hurry up. Move it, Rosu. Can't you hear? Go now, Fane. What's happening? Hey, what about Sisi? Mortu, go see if there is anyone there. Go on, go on. Hey, folks, it begins to rain. Get the roof up, Fane. Now help me! Anuta. Do you want to sit here for a minute? My leg is asleep. Hey, Pasha... Better for fifth, right? What do you think, Fane? Anuta? - I'm over here. - What do you want? Anuta, come here. Why? What do you want? - I want to show you something. - What? Wait. - Come... Here! - What is it? - Water. - Water? - But why? - The others don't need to know. Can I have some? - It is for you, Anuta. - For me? Have a drink too. It's good. Your chin is all wet. Anuta! - Come here, I found water. - Hide the water. See you soon. - Why should I give you? - Because I found it. - I found it. You liar. - Just calm down! Hands off my bottle. The bottle belongs to him! He has found it. - So it's all yours, right? - Leave me alone. You, shut up! What the hell did you do? If you've given me, I would've shared it. How much? Done, forget it. Broken. You can not do anything. You dropped it. It happened because he did not left. - And what you want now? - That was my bottle. That's it, I'm tired of this, see you tomorrow. Jan. What if someone finds us here? The car is outside. Don't worry, someone can watch for it. Wait a minute. Well, draw. Leave him. He should sleep. He needs to drive. Knock it off, stop play-acting. Stop it, Mortu. It's not going to work, so draw. Good night. Now you, Rosu. I wish you all good night! Now we expect from you now, Pasha. Good night everyone. Come, Anuta. - What is it, Rosu, can't sleep? - No. If you're tired, Pasha, I can keep watching for you. Since when you are so helpful? Well, I thought... for you. Turned out okay for that rat Jan. - He's supposed to be here instead of you. - What? Yeah, there were two short matches when you took it. It's here, look, he broke the match in his hand before your turn. - I'll smash his face in! - No, wait. I can not wait! Want to make a fool of myself? Wait, here's something else you can do. Steal the car. Think how they'll look tomorrow morning. - But how? - Don't worry, I can drive. You can drive? Do you think I have slept throughout the journey? - I watched clutch, all that stuff. - But what about Fane? Fane? He's with the rest of them, don't you know that? Come on. - Man, can you really drive? - Sure I can. - Now, come on. It begins to rain. - Okay, just drive carefully. Lord, you said you can drive. Hey, stop! Stop, wait! Wait, wait ya! What has happened? - Jan, what's the matter? - No idea. He's gone. Stop! Wait! What's up, now tell me! Where are the others, Fane? What has happened? - The car is stolen. - What have you done? And what about you? Huh? You know, I was sleeping. It's not my fault. I did not watch for. I ever fall asleep for a minute. A minute. Shut my eyes for only a minute. Are you daft? I have not kept guarding. Stop it. Get lost. Go and cough somewhere else That's enough. Stop it. All day you're pushing him around. Leave him alone! Come on, Mortu. Let's go. Leave me alone. I don't need anyone. I'll do what I want. I cough whenever I want. Come on, Mortu. We go on, yeah? Stop crying. Come on, honey... Anuta? People, wake up quickly. Come over here! Come on! Quick! Hurry! I believe that is the jaguar. - What's the noise? - It sounds like the Jaguar. Hide. Face down. There they are. Now! - Stop! - Thief! - Wait. - Stop, damn it! - Stop it! - You thief! Leave me alone! Fane, wait! Faster, Fane, drive faster! Come on out! Hey. Hey.
