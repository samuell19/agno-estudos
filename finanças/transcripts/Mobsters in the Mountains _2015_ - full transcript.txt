Sure, thank you very much. Hey my friend, you look-a terrible. What happened to you? Who did this to you? What's it to you? Why are you asking me this? Amico, what happened? Who did this? Who are your tormentors? Alright, alright I'll tell you. First it was these two robbers. Then some big bulky guy who had tattoos all over him. Now who did this to your faccia? Was it these robbers or was it this bulky...bulky guy? The bald guy did that. Eh, disgrazia. The people in this neighborhood, they can be such a nuisance. Do you mind if I share this table with you and sit down? Oh sure, sure. Please sit down. Grazie, grazie. Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Felipe. I work for Don Gatti, I'm his right hand, right hand man. Hold on. You're part of the Mafia? Shhh. Oh, sorry. Si, si. I represent the Woodlawn Family. We protect the entire East Coast.

It's that fool. He brought his boy with him. We're so scared. Scared? You gonna get scared. You didn't tell me this guy was crazy! Oh! My god, yo. Oh my god! They never even stood a chance. Vincent. Where have you been all night? Oh there's nothing to worry about, honey. Um, I was out with my friend Tom. I stayed at his place overnight. We were...we were just catching up on things. Just hanging out, you know? Something bad happen to you? No, no, no, no. Nothing too bad. Hey there Maria! Hi! (laughter) How are you, Maria? Give me a great big hug! Yeah. I'm so excited about the graduation. I'm so excited, you have no idea. 72 hours! 72 hours! Yes, three more days. Oh, you have no idea. My heart is like jumping out of my chest. Yeah. I'm so excited. Yeah, so that's great. Um, so how about, um, those places you applied to. Any news on that? Well, um...I got into Harvard! Oh, that's fantastic! I know! Give me a great big hug! Yeah, great big hug! Yes! I'm so excited! I'm so excited. We did it. Thank you. Honey, I'm so proud of you. Oooh. We did it together. Oh, isn't it great? I'm proud. You did wonderful, honey. Oh I love it. I'm trying, I'm trying. Harvard! Harvard! I wouldn't have done it without you guys though. Yeah, your mother did a lot. Oh yeah. So many times, so many times. We had to revise and edit her application. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I can't imagine all the work you put into that. It all paid off. Yeah. Yep, absolutely. It finally, finally did. You got it. Now Vincent, tell us honestly. What happened to you? What's wrong with your face? Oh nothing, um... Something obviously happened to you. Alright, okay. I got into trouble out in the neighborhood. Alright? Did you get hurt? Uhh. Well, um... Well look at his face. Just, uh...just... I, I don't know how to say this, uh. Hold on Maria, could you just wait a sec? Oh, Rosetta. Can I talk to you about this in the other room? What? No. Thank you. No. No, Vincent. No, we will not keep any secrets in front of our daughter. Ah, yeah. Okay. We're a family. We share in everything. Absolutely. I...I understand. Yes. So what happened? Alright. I don't know how I'm going to say this, okay um... ...okay I don't know where to start, um... ...alright. I got mugged by a bunch of guys out in the neighborhood. Oh my god. What?! Yeah. What do you mean? Just minding my own business and that's what happened. And then after the stealing, this big ugly guy with tattoos, he beat me up for no reason. What?! Why would he do that? Why? Why? Look at this. I don't know. He's crazy. He's just crazy. And he also said he didn't like that I stared at him. Are you serious?! He did. What is it with the people in this neighborhood? But hold on, that's not the end of it. Okay, I went into the cafe. Um, the waitress gave me a free coffee, because you know, I was deprived of my wallet and all. And so I met this Italian guy who says he works for a Mafia family. (gasp) And what was their name again? Uh...what was that? Oh the Woodlawn Family. Oh my god! What is that? Um, so what he said was that he would get his mob to protect me in bad neighborhoods if I made monthly payments. Oh you stop right there. Vincent, this is one the worst things you could tell us. Is it? Really. Yes. The Woodlawn Family mob, they're one of the worst. What? Oh god! Yeah, they're one of the most evil and violent crime syndicates embedded in America. Oh no! Not even the police are able to stop them. Alright, I don't want...could we... They're too brutal. Honey, just calm down. I'm sorry. I don't want to talk about it. I don't want to talk about it. I'm sorry but sweetie, you need to hear this too. I'm sorry you're into this, I'm sorry. As I was saying, the Woodlawn Family mob is just so diabolical, some of the things that they do are just unspeakable. Could you, um, tell me some of these, uh, wicked things they do? Yeah I can give you examples, sure. I read in the paper that one of their victims released from their "dungeon", he was treated most cruelly. Really? Get up. Sit down. You know why you're here?! It's the Don Gatti school of finance! We're here to teach you not to be late for payments. You got it, grunt? Fuck off, guinea. What did you call me?! You heard me. First lesson. You know, I'm getting really fucking tired of this shit. How many times do I have to constantly show people you don't fuck with me? How hard is it to not make a payment?! Well you know what, you don't have to answer that. Gilda will gladly take it out of you. So you like hurling insults, huh? Well how about we...remove some bodyparts? No! No? I think so. What about you guys? Think so? Get to work, boys. When you're done with this fucker, I want his head! You hear that? "Dungeons"? "Dungeons"?! I don't want to talk about this anymore! I'll never be able to sleep! Maria. Maria, I'm sorry. They dumped his body into the East River after they killed him. What?! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I know it's awful. Of course it's awful. Oh, I...I don't know how I got myself into this. I... Vincent, do you realize just how serious this is that the Mafia got you hooked onto them? Not just you but your whole entire family. Oh I wasn't thinking, I'm so sorry. Oh! They have your address, they have your phone number, they have everything, they have all the information about us. What are we going to do? Yeah. What are we going to do about this? We're leaving. What?! Yeah. We're what? Pack all your things right now. We're leaving the city and we're not coming back. We can't just leave just like that! Where are we going to go?! I have a job to go to! I have a job. I know, we have our friends. I worked 20 years to get to the position I'm at! I'm sorry, I understand that. I'm sorry, it's a great job. But for our safety, Maria, Rosetta, we have to get out of here. I'm sorry but this is the only thing I can think of right now, spur of the moment. Where are we gonna go?! What...where... Uh, oh okay, um... Darn it, I hope I don't forget anything important. I'll get my bag. I think your father's lost a few marbles. I think it's more than just a few, ma. I think he must have gotten hit on the head too. Excuse me. Rosetta, a lot of my paperwork from work is, uh, missing. Have you seen it at all? I told you, I don't know where it is. Okay I'll look over here. I got some of it. I got some of it on the table. Ok. Oh, my shirts. They're all wrinkled and I don't care. And how are we going to successfully elude the Mafia? Have you thought this out? Maggie. Anything you need? They have henchmen everywhere. I'm sorry, did you say something? I wasn't listening. There's so much on my mind. I'm sorry, you were saying? I said how are we going to successfully elude the Mafia? Oh, I'm trying to map that out. Ok. Ok, Rosetta, Maria, this is what we'll do, um...let's see. Wanna go for a ride? Huh? Yeah. Go for a ride? The first thing we're gonna do, um...listen girls, we're gonna, um... we're gonna do something to disguise us. Uh... We can't let them see our faces when we leave. Understand? Okay? Get some clothes, get some clothes to um...get sunglasses. Get sunglasses, hoods, hats, anything. So where are we gonna go? Where's our next home going to be? Um, pardon me? Where's our next home going to be? Oh I haven't thought of that yet. Um, maybe somewhere in, um, how about maybe Connecticut or Massachusetts? You want those too? Yeah, that's fine. Thanks. Connecticut? Dad, what about Harvard? We can't go to... I'm sorry? Can you make a decision now? I will, I will. Um there's so much on my mind right now, Rosetta. My mind is just exploding. Um, I'm sorry but... I don't think Maggie's going to like Connecticut. You want the decision now? Um, let's see. I'm thinking, I'm thinking, I'm thinking... It can't be Connecticut because it's too close to New York. Yeah too close. Oh I'll get to that. Please. Obviously. So not Connecticut. Uh, how about Massachusetts? Like um, Williamstown, Holyoke, Amherst... Fitchburg? Fitchburg. You mean in Central Massachusetts? Yeah. Yeah. So Fitchburg it will be, Rosetta. It's in Massachusetts, Harvard's in Massachusetts. So that's where we're gonna go. And what are we gonna do about the dog? Because, you know, if we're seen with the dog. Oh poor Maggie, I almost forgot about that. What do you mean? We can't take her with us. What do you mean we can't take her with us?! We can't. I'm sorry Maria but we can't take her with us. We're gonna have to leave her with one of our friends or relatives because they all love her. You know that. Of course. Okay...goodbye Brooklyn. Goodbye New York. Bye. So Charlie, how ya doing? I haven't seen you in a while. Yeah, I'm doing fine. I'm holding my own. Yeah, um...so the driving business has been good. I haven't seen you in a while and, um, it's still going strong? It has been okay. It has its days, you know? I see. Some days better and others not. You know, it's been good to me. Yeah it's good to hear. And you know, um, yeah that's why I picked Charlie. He's a great man, great driver, very trustful especially in our crisis. Yeah. It sure is a crisis. We need a man like Charlie. Yeah. Who else can we trust anymore, you know? Gotcha. I never expected any of this, really. You know, it looks like we're getting stuck in major traffic. Looks like a little bit of traffic here, well we're gonna...we'll get to Fitchburg, Mass. That's how it is every afternoon, 'round that time. Hey New York is always congested until we get to other states, right? Yup. Huh, girls. It's kind of sad leaving New York. We might never be back, I'm sorry to say. Hopefully in a couple years, maybe. Yeah, things might cool down by then. Hopefully. Yeah. Yeah. Is that your phone? It is. Yeah, it is. Who is it? Uh... Oh no! It's Felipe, Don Gatti's sidekick. Oh damn! I thought you were through with him. What are you going to say to him? Don't say anything, let me do the talking. Hi, it's Vincent. Hey, Vincent! It's Felipe. Where are you? My man Rao says you're not at home. Is everything okay? Ha ha, oh yeah, um. I'm with my wife and my daughter, uh. We're going away, um, and visit old relatives of ours down in Florida. Ah, eh. Florida, eh? Yeah we're, we're almost there right now. Almost down at that sunny state, yeah. You're gonna need some sunscreen. (laughter) Yeah, yes, I know. It's a scorcher down here. Yup. Is everything okay? Okay, now you tell me when you come back. Uh-huh. Alright, Felipe. As soon as you get back, you let me know. Okay? Yeah, I'll talk to you later. Okay, bye. Okay, Vincent. Ciao. Son-of-a-bitch! I hope that helps in giving him the slip. So do I. Bastard. You know... I'm sorry. ...I, I...I just hope that, you know, my freshman year is not gonna, you know, be um... Take your time honey. I know you're upset if you can't talk. You know? You're afraid it'll be ruined? Yeah, yeah I do. With the threats and all that crap, you know I just hope that it's normal like everyone else. That'll be nice. We want that too, dear. You know something, I think we're gonna have to change our identities like I said back at the apartment. We're even gonna have to change our names. You think so? Yeah, change who we are completely. I guess we'll have to for the safety of our lives, we'll have to change our names. That's a good idea. Um, yeah let me see. Okay, I have an idea already of my name. It is, uh, hmm... ...I'll choose...Franklin. You could call me Frank, but Frankin. Hope I can remember. (laughter) I don't know what to call myself, I've never had to think about stuff like this. You know my parents christened me Rosetta. Think about it. You have a lot of girlfriends that have nice, pretty names. You want one of their names? No. Charlie, do you have any ideas? That I can call myself? Oh, let's see. What about Angela? You like that? Yeah Angela's nice, but... What do you think about that? No I don't like being called Angie. We're kind of mad at Italians right now. Yeah, maybe we should stick to like American names. What about Julie? Julie? Julie's pretty, but it's... You don't look like a Julie. No, I don't think so. Uh, you don't like...Michelle? Michelle. What do you think? Michelle? It's pretty, I like Michelle. And then if the telemarketers call, they're gonna call you Michael? No, I don't want that. Forget that. They'll just get it all wrong. And then, yeah. Ha ha ha! Let's try this. What about Katherine. How do you like that? Katherine's a nice name, that's regal sounding. That is, that sounds...Charlie, thank you. That sounds beautiful. Yeah, that will, it'll stick, it'll stick. Thank you. And now Maria, it's your turn. What would you like? Uhh...I don't know, I don't know. Um... ...Charlie, help me out here. Okay, I'm the man for that. Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Name games, Charlie. What about, what about Theresa? You're a good man. Theresa? No, no. Terri, sounds like a dog's name. They'll call you Terri. Ha ha ha! Yeah it kind of does. Yeah. Oh uh, Emma. How about Emma? I know it's definitely different for a name now. Emma, Emma. Yeah and Emma it shall be. You are my brave, beautiful sweetheart. Thanks dad, I love you. Oh thank you, I love you too. And you are, you're brave too. You're also my brave sweetheart, my original brave sweetheart. Oh thanks. Yeah I'm trying to get there, honey. Okay, I'm gonna get some sleep. Oh you want to get some sleep? Have a nice nap, honey. Take a nap and then we'll let you know when we're getting close. It's gonna be a nice, slow ride. Let's enjoy it. Yeah, Charlie. Yeah, we can trust Charlie. Franklin, I'm worried. What are you worried about? Oh, what if the Mafia finds us? Would they kill us if they found us? I...I, I shall rue the day when that happens. If we are attacked and chased, we will just keep on running and hide and then we'll, we'll pick our best hiding place and call the cops. Worst case scenario: all of us, we must prepare and be resourceful. Yeah we need to be resourceful and pray. You know I hope to god that we're gonna stay safe from all the goons. Yes. Yeah. We will, we will. And in any case... ...and in any case, if we are caught I will do my very best to get... to keep us safe, and to get us out of this mess. It's a mess, alright. And believe me, I'm gonna do whatever it takes to keep us safe. Ah, have a great vacation. Thank you Charlie, I'm gonna go bring in everyone. Oh, thank you. Need a hand? What do you think? It's lovely. It is. This is it, Emma. Well. Good morning, sir. Good morning. I'll have a table for one. Okay. Right this way. Can I start you out with a drink? A hot chocolate, please. Okay. Hey, excuse me. Yeah. You're Emma Cole, yes? Um, sorry. How do you know me? I came here on purpose to meet you. That sounds a little weird. Please don't be alarmed, Miss Cole. Dylan Reyes, FBI. Oh so you're...um, I'm sorry. What did you want to see me for? Why don't we both, uh, sit down so we can talk. I'll tell you what's going on. Do you still want that drink? Um yes, but I'll take it after I'm done talking. Take a seat, please. Okay. I came here because the FBI recently determined that 6 years ago, Vincent Richardson adapted his identity to Franklin Cole. And he did the same with the identities of you and his wife. My mission is to place him and his family into the witness protection program. We're seeking evidence in our case against the Woodlawn Crime Family and its leader Don Gatti. So what will happen when we enter witness protection? In a private location, we will interview your father to recount his interactions with the gang. Franklin will describe to us who they are and what they look like. The other benefit to the program is that we will be present at your residential location to provide protection and defense against any vengeful mob members. Okay. Can I ask you a question, officer Reyes? Call me Dylan. Okay Dylan, um, can it just be you and not the federal agents and the cops? What makes you feel that way? You know. I just want to feel that my family retains its, you know, peaceful way of life before the Mafioso servants and the street criminals. You know I...I just want to feel that...you know...and now the government authorities. I just want to feel that things are peaceful and normal. And if you were the sole protector, I would prefer that. You strongly feel that way, Miss Cole? Yeah, that's my strong preference. Uh, you can call me Emma. Then I'll see it done, Emma. I'll contact my superior that I'll independently handle the investigation and protection. But if there's a critical situation and our lives are threatened, I'll need to radio for backup assistance. Sounds perfect to me. Uh... ...oh. Uh, you know it's getting close to my break, so let's... May I treat you to brunch? Yeah. Yeah, I would like that. What interests you from the menu today? I usually just get the cheese omelet. What about you? I'll get, uh...french toast. Oh yeah, they make 'em good here. You'll like it. You sound like an experienced saleswoman. Oh I do? Thank you. Good morning folks. Emma, I know you want the usual. What can I get for you. I'll get the french toast, please. There you are. You're welcome. Thanks. Cute boyfriend. Ha ha! Hello, this is the Cole residence. Hey dad, it's Emma. Oh, hi my dear. What's up? Um, I'm having lunch with an FBI agent. Now wait a minute. What is going on here? Oh nothing. Um, nothing serious, he wants to talk to you, um... ...he wants to interview you about the Italian mob. He wants to bring justice upon it. I see then. And what circumstances would apply to this interview? Um, I guess it's a federal custody maybe, or station. Uh, could you do me a favor? Um, I...I don't want to stray away from the safety of my home or my, you know, my hometown. But could you ask him if he could come here for the information? Dylan, uh, would it be alright if you were to go to our house and interview him there? Um, yeah okay. I'll drive to his home. What's the address for that, please? Uh, it's 447 Townsend Street. We have an agreement. Okay. Yeah, he said yes. Did you say his name was Dylan? Yeah, that's right. His name is Dylan. Um, is he nice? Yeah, he really is. Okay, I'll take your word for it. Emma, come home soon. Okay? Oh I certainly will, dad. Bye-bye. Okay, bye-bye. So, things seem to be arranged well. How's that, uh, french toast? Very tasty. Thanks for the smart recommendation. It's my pleasure to treat a hard working federal agent to a hearty meal. You know? You seem to travel a lot in your detective missions. You have a good taste in restaurants. I've had many investigative cases that took me to metropolises like Houston, Seattle, Chicago and Atlanta. Basically my operations have taken me all over the map. And that's how I'm acquainted with, uh, many landmarks and fine dining and spectacular cities and towns. You've been to a lot more places than I have. Seems I've been stuck on the East Coast for most of my life. Perhaps Brooklyn and New York weren't that great for you because of the mob's tyrrany. Unfortunately, that's true. Well all we need from your father is solid evidence and identities, and my federal bureau will inevitably bring down the malevolent syndicate. I feel fortunate, you know, to have a knight in shining armor such as yourself to save a damsel in distress like me. You seem to be very familiar with fairy tales your parents told you. Yup. Yeah, uh, they used to read me the British classic which was, um, "King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table". Your parents made an excellent choice. Are you almost done with that? Yeah, I think I'm satisfied. Shall we go? Sure. Hey waitress. You liked our fine food, huh. All set? Alright. Yes, absolutely. Here is, um, $13 for the meal. Thank you. $8 for your tip. Wow, really? Thank you! Ready to leave? Come along, Emma. Yeah. Okay. You have a dollar? Dollar, please? Argh! Hey, you got my purse! Get him, Dylan! Ha ha! Try and get me, suckers! Get off me! Come on, man! Let me go, man! Ugh, shoot. Ahh! Get off me, man! Not on my watch. Let go. Let go. Come on man, let me go! I didn't do anything wrong! Yeah, glad you said that. Get up. Oh shit! Sit over there, scumbag. All units, agent Reyes here. Got a suspect who robbed a woman of her pocketbook. I got him on the corner of, uh, Meehan Street and the parking lot. I need him booked, ASAP. Copy that, agent Reyes. Units will be dispatched. Thank you, Dylan. That's why I'm here to serve and protect. You really are a protective knight, aren't you? Yeah. Anything for you. I have to report to my FBI captain in Boston. Where are you going, your parents' home in Fitchburg? Yeah I am. Yeah my folks, they didn't want me too far from home for safety, so... Has any of your friends contacted you since the mob? Ah, sadly no. Uh, I really didn't get to hang out with them at Harvard, so, or go out to parties. That's a shame, but hey, gotta get going. What time, what time's your train? Um, well I'm taking the commuter rail, so it's about 40 minutes. And I get on the Orange Line to get to that big train, so... Oh nice, you definitely don't want to keep your parents waiting. Okay? No I definitely don't. You know, it's really important to them that I stay safe. So, alright. Well I look forward to more protection from you. Anytime. Yeah, and thank you again for thwarting that thief. You're welcome. Your security is my highest priority. Let's go. So... We parked there. Yeah so, uh, you can go back home. Um, I'll wait here until I go to the transportation center to pick up Emma. And I'll hang around. I might stop to get pizza or something. Oh here we are. Okay. I'll go home and I'll just put the groceries away. Sure. You can help me load them into the car. Will do. Uh-huh. What are we planning to have for supper? Gets stuck sometimes. Ha ha! I got it. Open it, please. Here you go. One more. One more? Yeah it's better off in the back seat. You got it, Katherine. I'm sure the meal's gonna be delicious tonight. Now Franklin, stay safe. Huh? You too. You too, honey. Everything's gonna be alright. Okay. And we'll call you when we're ready to have you pick us up. Alright, I'll see you at dinner. Yup, and save a spot for Emma. Shall do. Bye-bye. Yup, take care. Hello. Hi, Hi Katherine. Yeah, um, I just had some sliced pizza. And, uh... yeah, yes. And guess who I met there. Remember my old friend Bill Sands? He's a nice guy. Remember him? Yeah, so this is it. He's gonna pick me up, he's waiting for me. We're gonna go over to his house for a while. I haven't seen his wife and kids in a long time. Well it's 2 hours before I pick up Emma at the train station, when she's coming back from Boston. Okay? Yeah. Okay, don't worry about it. Yeah, I'll be there in time. It's 2 hours. I just want to see, uh, Bill. And, um... Okay, okay. Yeah. Okay, honey. I'll see you then, look forward to it. Bye. Hey! What are you doing?! What the-- Argh! Well, well, well. What do we have here? What's going on?! Vincent the coward, remember me? Yeah...I think so. Ah, you tried to run away like a little cockroach but we tracked you down. How the fuck did it unravel so fast?! It's easy, it's easy to find a cockroach. All you do is look around in scummy places. Now what you're gonna do is make it up to us. Okay? Capisce? Yeah. What do you want me to do? You and your family are gonna scrounge and work to get us $3 million. Okay? Capisce? $3 million, what?! How am I gonna get that much? I don't have-- 48 hours! 48 hours! Okay, okay! I'll try! I'll try! Or you and your stupid family are gonna get killed! Yes, sir. You understand? I understand, sir. Perfectly. You can't run from us. You pay us the money and everything is good. I won't. Won't. Okay. Alright. 48 hours. Hey, Emma. Oh hey, dad. Ah, you made it. Oh, great to see you, honey. Oh, beautiful. Yeah, oh what's wrong? What happened? What's wrong? Jeez, uh...Jeez, Emma. Actually it wasn't a good day and it's not a good evening. They discovered us. Who did? The goddamn Mafia guys. What?! Are you serious?! How...how did this happen?! What...you gotta be kidding me! They're onto me. I'm not. I'm...I'm not kidding you. This is definitely serious. Are...are they gonna kill us?! Are they gonna like trap us?! No, Emma. Thank god they're not. Because I've been talking with one of the thugs there. And he's working things out, and he's gonna make it safe for us. And, um... as long as I pay the...the price of $3 million. $3 million! Dad, we don't have that kind of money! The...the job I have doesn't pay for that! And you just retired! Oh my god! $3 million?! I'm working things out the best I can, believe me. And this man, this agent, federal agent, Dylan... Yeah. You know him pretty well by now? Yeah, I mean he's my friend. You know, he can maybe help or something. I don't know. I was thinking since we're part of the witness protection program, maybe Dylan's agency can help us pay the ultimatum that I owed, or something on that idea. That actually might work. You know what I mean? There's a major crisis. We have to be safe, and that's their job to keep us safe. And these are major criminals. Right. Right. Oh Emma, I'm so sorry. You come home to this crap. I really feel bad about this. Look what I did 6 years ago. Ugh! It happens. It's life. Well maybe we can, maybe we can like talk to him and try to figure out something with the feds. You know, there isn't anything I can think of because we're, we're...you know...it's... I feel awful about this, 6 years ago I originally got us in trouble and I thought we were home free. I don't know how they found us. I don't know. I was shocked, your mother is shocked, but we're gonna get out of this. We're in good hands, I've been talking to people on the phone. Alright. We'll see mom soon and tell her some of the bad news, but we're gonna keep calm about it. You wanna get in the front seat? And I'll get in the back. Yeah. Sure. Hello. Hi. Hi, Emma. Hi, Franklin. What's the matter? You look really upset. We gotta get home quickly, the mob is onto us. Oh my god! Again?! 6 years later for god sakes. How did they find us?! I don't know, I don't know. What are we gonna do? Well, um, I know there's uh, what's his name, Dylan. He's an FBI agent, he's coming to our house in like half an hour I think. So at least we have protection. You know? So he can help us out somehow? Yeah precisely, he's gonna put us in the witness protection program I guess. But I told him, you know, he's gonna be the only FBI agent on site. Yeah just one, I hope it's only one because I don't want my novel house turned into a government office circus, if you know what I mean, Emma. Yeah. I know, mom. Don't worry, Katherine. It's gonna work out alright. I'll do the best I can. I'm worried sick. I know you are but we're gonna take care of this. We're in good hands. I don't know how we're gonna sleep tonight. We're in good hands with Dylan and his government. Absolutely. I hope so. So do I. Who's the right hand man to Don Gatti? Felipe. In the years spent in hiding, has there been any recent interactions from your Mafia stalkers? Yes, today. Felipe demanded on a take it or leave it basis that I pay $3 million, and... ...and they threatened to kill me and my kin if I don't. As part of the terms and conditions of the witness protection program, the FBI is obligated to pay money provided by the government to protect citizens and witnesses. I'll make a request to US Treasury to deliver $3 million tomorrow. We will eternally thank you and your bureau for doing so. That concludes our interview. I have sufficient information and evidence to bring justice to this mob. Dylan, since you're staying with us I've prepared your bedroom. I think you'll find your bed fluffy and comfortable. Thanks, I appreciate the hospitality. Emma! How are you? Good. She's doing awesome, she's sitting right in front of me. Yeah, yeah. She's getting older, but no she's doing really good. It's hot so she's hanging out. I can let you talk to her for a second. Hold on. It's Emma! It's Emma! Wanna say hi? Did you hear her? Yeah I know, she's a good old girl. How you guys doing in Fitchburg, right? Alright, well I'll talk to you later. Tell everyone I said hello. Alright, bye. Good, Maggie. They're gonna come visit you. They're gonna come visit you sometime, huh. Come on. Emma, you wanna get it? Okay, thank you. I got it. Hi. Hi. Um, who are you? Sorry. Agent Bob Richards. Oh, um, alright come in. It's the FBI agent. Oh hello. I'm Emma, that's my dad Franklin and mom Katherine. Hi I'm Franklin. I'm Katherine. Nice to meet you. Agent Bob Richards. I'm here to replace agent Dylan. He was recently involved in an accident. There was a... What kind of an accident? There was a bank robbery in Worcester and he was injured, but he is in fair condition. Okay...he was just here. He was here earlier. How did he get out? Sneak out a window? I mean... He's alright though, right? You said he was okay? He's in fair condition. Was this an emergency call with the FBI? Yes. Thank you. Well come on, come in and sit down. Yes please do, sir. So, uh, detective Bob. Is that what your name is? Yes. What's going to happen to our case? Dylan was supposed to be in charge of taking care of us and protecting us, and especially my daughter. I'll be here to replace agent Dylan for now. For how long? Probably until he gets better. Okay. Hello, this is the Cole residence. Shut up, Vincent! Shut up! Okay I don't fucking care about your fake identity shit! Gatti, I know you're extremely angry with me. Oh yeah, yeah? Well listen to this. This is how it's gonna go. There's a hit list, and let me tell you you're on the fucking top of it. I...I'll give you the millions of dollars. I beg of you... ...don't put my loved ones on the hit list. Alright I'm gonna go, I'm gonna rip you from the insides out. I'm gonna make you fucking beg... ...and when you are begging, drowning in your own blood like the pig you are... ...I'm gonna fucking rip your soul right out of your fucking chest. Alright...I'll call the FBI...I'll talk to the government. Dammit! I'll get that damn money for you! But please...don't harm my family! You know what's funny, I know exactly what your wife is doing. Why are you mentioning my wife?! Tell me! Why are you mentioning my wife?! But you know what's funny? It can all...go away. How the hell can you see us?! Click...click... ...boom! No! Oh! Ahh! No! Katherine! (laughter) Katherine! No! Oh god! No...Oh! Hey...hey you! Get back here! Hey, you bastard! Get back here! You'll pay for this, you bastard! You...you better run! Ugh. Oh, Katherine. I'll get the bastard. Katherine. Emma, I am so sorry, sweetheart. I am so sorry. I wish there were something I could have done... ...something I could have done to prevent this from happening to your mother. There's nothing we could have done...you know... ...they took her away from us, dad! They took her away! They did. I know. I know. I know. I know, sweetheart. It's okay. Emma, I'm so sorry. Is there anyway I can cheer you up? Please, please do something... (sobbing) How about we go in the other room, please. Jesus, sweetheart. You'll be alright. What is it, Bob? I didn't order a pizza. Wrong address? A special delivery for Franklin and Emma. Maybe it's one of the neighbors? Cause I didn't order a pizza. Should we take it in over here? Hey, I don't know if I'm hungry right now but let's see. Maybe there's a note, there's a note from a neighbor or one of our relatives. Yeah you know how it is, flowers and all that they've been homing to us. What?! What the?! I'm scared... Why?! I don't understand. I don't know...I don't know... Emma, I don't know what to say...it's never ending. (gasp) Oh my god! What the hell was that?! What was that?! Are you alright?! I don't know. Should I...I don't know what that was, I don't want to go check. Stay here. I'll go check. Where's dad? Dad?! Please be careful. Hey Emma, Bob! You alright?! What was that noise, that thundering sound outside?! I don't know! I just woke up! It scared the shit out of me! Oh my god! Bob, what should we do? I don't know...hey we better stay here, we better not go outside. It might be a threat, sounds like a threat to me. Listen, I'm gonna go check. Okay. Stay right here. I'm shaken. Oh my god. I'm glad you two are alright. It's okay, he's, he's checking. Yeah. That was an earful. Yeah, they probably ran away. What happened? What's going on? My car just got blown up. Oh my god! A bomb?! Oh my god! It could've been any one of us. Oh my god. I'm glad you were in here. Jeez. I'm glad you weren't in the car! We're gonna have to take the Amtrak now. Alright. That was part of the threat of that pizza box, that crazy thing they did? That was part of it? We should follow their orders now. Hello? You saw the fireworks? Gatti! You must stop this bloodshed once and for all! You got, you got me?! This has gone too far! We'll pay up and end this once and for all! You hear me?! I will say this: you have an option right now, Franklin. You can just send all the demons away, it's very simple. Yeah I hear you, Gatti. Take the money, you put it on Amtrak to New York City. From there, the instructions are easy. Travel up north to Yonkers. In the woods, there you'll meet who you need to drop the money off to. Just walk away, it will all go away. But if not, it's simple... ...ashes, ashes, we all fall down. Ciao. So this is what this whole ordeal has led us to. I don't know when it'll be over. Oh lord, I know you are furious at those criminals for slaying my wife... ...and I know when it's opportune, that you'll exact justice and wrong them for their actions... ...because you and I know, my lord, that justice always prevails on our land. In the name of the father, son, and the holy spirit, amen. So this is it. This is the park for the drop off. You ready? Yeah. This is it. We gotta do it. Yeah, okay. Hey Franklin, let me put something in your pocket real quick. Hold this for me. Alright? Will do. Okay, let's go. Oh shit! Oh oh oh! What are you... Alright! Take it easy, take it easy. Alright. Go, go. Look at this. Look what the cat dragged in. That is fun stuff to know. You know what this is? It goes boom, and the best part is it's linked to a bunch of cellphones with microchips and it just explodes. You know what's underneath here? Gasoline too. So not only will it explode, it'll take everything out, you'll just become dust. Any final words? Fuck you. Ho ho! Gatti, why'd it have to be this way? Why? Oh I don't know, maybe because you fucking never paid me. Maybe the simple fact that I had to chase you for over a year to get...oh wait a minute... Because you've nothing better to do?! You know what is better? Shooting your mother! Yeah, yeah. Just, like, fucking taking her out. Fucking pig! And you care all about your money, huh! That's all you fucking care about! The world goes around with money, sweetie. Yeah well guess what, it doesn't. Well I hate to tell you the account of it. But you know what, you guys have a lot of time to think while you blow up. Gatti, Gatti! I'll see you in hell! You have no right! You're an evil man for what you did to my wife Katherine! Dammit! Coward! Shut the fuck up! You leave her alone! You shut the fuck up too! How about just killing me? Alright, alright. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. No, shh! Dad, quiet! How do we get out of here? Where'd he go? I don't know. Let's try. I can't do it. I can't even stand up! Bomb's gonna go off! I'm gonna try. What are we gonna do, dad? What are we gonna do? Ow! Damn! Hang on. Bob! Please get us out, there's a bomb here! Thanks, Bob! Thanks a lot! There's a bomb, he's gonna detonate a bomb, Bob. Okay we gotta evacuate right now! Come everyone, move it! Let's get out of here! You know what guys, it was a shame. She was cute. Freeze! Aah! Dad?! Dad?! Bob?! Oh shit! Emma! You're alright? I thought he had you. This way! Oh! Are you alright guys? Yeah. Are you okay? Emma, are you okay? Yeah. I'm fine. What happened? The explosion, my ears are ringing. How did this happen? How did this happen? I don't know. The bombing Gatti threatened us with. Oh my god! What a mess! Yeah, I'm okay. How did you find us? That cell phone I secretly placed into your dad's pocket. The FBI designed it with a tracking device. It made this warehouse so visible on our GPS. Oh that is great work, Bob. Bob, I'm very grateful to you. You came to the rescue. Your work is just fantastic. Rao was arrested in Connecticut. He'll be extradited to Boston where he'll be prosecuted for killing your mom. That's wonderful. There's gonna be justice, honey. I'm glad you're alright. Oh god, it's all over. It's over. It's over. We survived all that. It's alright. Oh boy. I don't want anymore memories of that building. Thank you. Hello, princess. Oh hey, dad. Did you get the deli food? Yeah. Yeah I was in Manhattan. I just got some, uh, some food from Katz's Deli, our favorite. Yeah. Has Bob arrived yet? Oh yeah, he's here. Yeah he brought food beer. And yeah, I made dessert for us, so I hope you like it, I don't know. Oh great. Yeah, we're gonna have a good time tonight. Oh yeah, we will. Yup. Yeah, yeah. Bob's a great guy. Yeah he is. Yeah he is, I feel safe, so... I'm glad that you and Bob have become close friends. I'm really happy about that. Yeah. Oh, very close. Yeah he keeps me safe so that's all that matters, and I feel safe with him, so... Okay then. Okay, Emma. Yeah I feel the same way, I'm hungry. Yup, so I'll be home in a little while. Okay? Oh I'm very hungry. We're both very hungry, we're just waiting for you. Okay, honey. Bye. Hello, Vincent. I said hello, Vincent. Excuse me, sir, you have the wrong person. Are you sure? Uh, I don't know you and my name is not Vincent. Franklin...your name is Vincent. Who are you? Me? I'm Sebastian Gatti, Sal Gatti's brother. You ever hear of me? No I don't think so. I didn't think you did. Yeah? Okay. I have a .38 caliber gun in my jacket right now. You will take me to your house. You will act natural about it. Okay. If you make a false move, I will drill you. But what do you want?! What do you want?! It's simple. Revenge. You and your fucking FBI friends are the reason that my brother's gone right now. But we didn't kill him. Look at that nice car right there, Vincent. Yeah, I know. It would be a shame if I got blood on it. Take it easy. Now Vincent, who's in the apartment? Who's in the fucking apartment?! My daughter Emma and our friend Bob Richards. Sebastian, whatever you do...uh, whatever you do, don't harm my daughter. Please. I'll harm whoever the fuck I want, Vincent. That's, that's my one request. You can kill me, but don't...don't harm my daughter. I mean it. Sorry, I'm the one with the gun. I don't think you have negotiating tactics right now. I have all the cards, don't I? Yes. Don't I? Look me in the eye. Don't I?! Yes...yes, Sebastian. I just want...I, I want you to spare my daughter. Piece of shit. I beg of you, please. I'll pay you any money you want to whoever. Stop hyperventilating, act natural! Yes. My building is up in the corner there. Okay? I made it clear you know who you're fucking with. Okay. Fucking slum. Right there. Fucking open it. Open the door, go in naturally. Okay. Oh hey, dad. How are you, sir? Hey kids...let's get this party started. Emma, honey, it's alright. I have it under control. Like hell you do, asshole. I'm sorry. Sir, what's this all about? What's your name? Agent-- Shut the fuck up, I know your name! I just want to see if you'd tell me. You carrying a piece on you? No, I'm not. We'll see about that. Spead 'em, and don't move! What do you want? Look at that! Amateur punk FBI agent didn't even bring his piece. Look, I'm not an amateur. I just, I never bring a gun to the home of my close friends. Shut the fuck up! Hey! Hey, what are you doing?! Alright...alright. You have a problem with what I just fucking did? No, alright it's okay. Honey, just...it's okay. Alright...alright... Who are you?! What do you want?! Vinnie, don't fuck with me...don't fuck with me right now, Vinnie. You got it. You got it, man. I am Sebastian Gatti, brother of the late Sal Gatti. Don of the Woodlawn Family. I introduced myself to daddy over here. After daddy let my fucking brother die in that explosion... ...I brought it upon myself to take over for the Woodlawn Family. And we are not to be fucked with. Ain't that right, Vinnie? That's right. Sebastian, I just wanna say, um...I just wanted my, my...my... Spit it out! Sebastian, I swear to god, I...I was concerned for my family. I never intended for your brother to get killed! Shut the fuck up! That's no excuse! He fucking killed my mom, you asshole! You go rot in fucking hell! What a foul mouth your daughter's got there. Please, leave her out-- Shall I shoot her fucking ass?! Please leave her out of it! Just focus on me! How about your fucking FBI friend, huh? I, I'll pay you any money you want! Um, just...just...please, reason with me! Please, just leave my daughter alone. I'll pay the money, I swear. Oh businessman tactics, huh? Alright! Okay. Vincent, money is only part of it. My brother Don is dead, but the Woodlawn is alive and well. To tell you the truth, I always hated my brother. My parents always favored him, and I spent 8 years in the slammer for something that he had me do. But he's dead now, right? And Sebastian's in charge. And the Woodlawn is alive and strong! Sebastian, the honest truth is with the help of the feds, they gathered all the money that I owed, I owed your brother and their family, honest. We gathered it together, we did everything they said. We went to the warehouse, we brought it to the warehouse as directed... ...we did everything as instructed. We, we went there and honest to god, we did everything we possibly could. And I did it all for the sake of my daughter, I didn't want my daughter to get hurt, honest. And then, and then we got there... ...your brother decided he was gonna kill me and my daughter, and we didn't know that. And we didn't know the feds were coming to rescue us. We didn't know that, we didn't want that to happen. You expect me to believe this bullshit, Vinnie? I tried. I tried, honest-- Oh well at least you fucking tried, huh, Vincent, huh?! That makes everything better, huh?! 'Cause you fucking tried, huh?! Let go, sweet stuff. And you, Bobby Richards. You motherfucker. You and your FBI friends came to their rescue, huh? Their knight in shining armor. I did whatever FBI work I could do in the name of the law-- Shut the fuck up! I don't give a shit what you did, you piece of shit! Well, let me tell you something. If anyone comes through that door that I don't know, I will end them. How do you like that, Bobby? Bobby! How do you like that?! Look, we could strike a deal. Oh you're a fucking businessman too, Bobby? Fucking pig. Leave him alone. Shut the fuck up. You shut the fuck up! Easy there, it's alright. Emma, Emma, that's enough. Just leave her alone. Vinnie. Vinnie, I think I'm gonna enjoy this one the most. Get off me. Get the fuck off me. Don't touch, please don't touch her! Abuse me if you have to, not her! Alright just leave her alone! I told you! I'll abuse whoever the fuck I want. Okay, okay. We can make some kind of a deal, Sebastian. Anything, money. What the fuck is with you guys and deals?! I am not one to be bargained with! Okay. Either way, pop, I don't give a fuck. As for you babe, how'd you like to come work in the porn industry? Stop! Stop! Get off me! No? You don't like the porn industry? Fuck no! What, are you crazy! Get off me! Stop! Hey! Hey, you cut it out! Leave her alone. I told...just leave her alone! So sweet stuff, you have a pretty face, hot body. Maybe I can get you a high paying job in the porn industry. Hey, fuck you. Okay you're gonna work in the whore house instead. How does that sound? Sebastian, I just want to say something, um, I work full time, and I'll be making a lot of money. And I would like her to work, to work for my company. And we'll build up the money to pay your family, I promise. Oh that's good for you, Vincent. You can keep working at your company. She's coming with me. Ain't that right, babe? Back the fuck up Bob. Back...the fuck... We'll do what you say. Alright! Alright! Alright! Alright! Okay?! Watch it now. Jeez, take it easy. Vinnie. She's getting on my nerves, Vinnie. It's fine. It's fine! Just calm down! I've had it up to here, Vinnie! I've had it up to here, Vinnie! Look, he has a gun to your face! Don't say anymore, Emma. Please. We can make a deal. Vinnie, you always have to protect your investments. She's gonna make a lot of money for me. I'd rather be penniless than work for you, you little douchebag! Huh?! Hey! Watch it, you! Oh what is wrong with you, man?! What the fuck are you doing?! That's my daughter! Calm the fuck down, and don't tell me what to do! Alright?! Alright, alright. Vincent, there will be no...more...running. You can go to Fitchburg. Hell, you can go to fucking Mars... ...but the Woodlawn Family will always find you. We're stronger now more than ever, because I'm in charge. Think of this as your orientation. All the work will be in order in the coming days. Franklin, there's someone at the door. Answer it! Okay, okay. Okay. Who is it? Caramia, Sebastian! Caramia, paisan! What, what, what, what?! Dylan! Watch it, Dylan! Drop it, freeze! Drop the gun! No, no! You drop yours! Put the gun down, slowly. Not an option, pig. I got the whole building surrounded. It's the end of the line for you. Give it up. Put...the gun...down. Okay? Everything fine now, buddy? Just tell me. How the fuck did you know the code?! I'm Dylan Reyes, FBI. It's my job to know these things, especially when it has to do with crime. Why don't you quit, soldier boy. Go ahead, arrest me. You can do all you want. But you know what? The Woodlawn Family will go on stronger than ever. Nope, it's not. It's going down. We've been watching you for the longest time. I bet you have. Wanna do a photoshoot sometime? Shut the fuck up. Me? You're telling me to shut the fuck up, pig?! Yes. Your brother tried to have me killed by a scumbag. I got shot, I recovered, and the robber sucked at marksmanship. Ha! You really know how to pick 'em. I'm glad you're alright, Dylan. Excellent work, Dylan. Great job, Dylan. Shut the fuck up! Hey I just wanna tell you this, this creep was abusing Emma. He didn't, like, keep his hands off! Makes me crazy. Maybe you were just spoiled your whole life. Sebastian! It's the end of the line for you. Freeze over there. Well turn around, slowly. Put your hands on the counter. Watch out! Aahh! He's got him. He's dead. He's got him. It's okay. Oh my... It's gonna be okay. Emma, sweetie. He's dead, don't look. This is, uh, agent Dylan Reyes, calling for agent Matthews. Yes? I got Sebastian over here, I shot him and killed him. I need an ambulance right away. I need a crew over here to come clean this up. Over and out. Got that, over and out. You guys okay? Yes. And you, Emma? Yeah. You guys okay? I'm just...I'm so glad you're here. You know? Thank you, it's okay. I was just doing my job. I give all the credit to agent Bob over there. He did all the leg work. Right from the beginning, I, I knew we had a good man just as good as you. And you Emma, you handled yourself very well with that man. That's why I call you my brave little sweetheart. Thanks, dad. Thanks. We gotta get you guys to a hotel. The FBI is gonna take care of everything, because we need this place. Okay. We gotta clean this place up. Alright? So Bob, take 'em to a hotel. Okay? Okay. After you guys. Go right ahead. You can easily step over, it's alright. Watch your step. It's alright. It's gonna be okay. Yeah. Good job. Thank you, Dylan. Okay, we're off. See you later, Dylan. You guys go...agent Bob. You guys go get some dinner first. Okay? I gotta be back here. Yes. Yeah we were planning dinner tonight but we all lost our appetite obviously. So, um, yeah we should plan dinner maybe tomorrow night or something. You can join us if you wish, Dylan. I wish but I'm sorry. Gotta write up this case, you know. Somewhere down the line, we're gonna get back to you. We're glad you're back on the scene, but unfortunately under these circumstances. You know? Take care. Okay? You too. Take care, guys. Thanks. Take care. We'll see you later. Good luck with everything. It's over. It's all over. Maggie, you like the ocean? Nice, huh? Okay, we're gonna go this way now. C'mon. We'll go for a nice walk.
