Eunuchs unite the ministers They firmly support Wei Zhongxian Protected by Wei Zhongxian, they are feared Dongchang and the eunuchs run amuck outside these walls Nobody considers who truly rules Dongchang I've served Dongchang for many years Why wouldn't I know? Miss Ling, You are just a chess piece in Dongchang Your family's extermination Was planned by people in Dongchang And then Wei Zhongxian came to you, offering a helping hand So you'd serve Dongchang with your heart and soul Elite assassins are trained this way in Dongchang That damn traitor, eunuch Wei!

It was you in the hotel Oh Ling Eunuch Li Come back, and serve Dongchang I'll spare your life I dreamed of avenging my parents And you, An inferior leader of imperial guards Should behave so badly in Dongchang I will revenge Ouyang Han with your life! Ouyang Sifu adopts all schemes He feels he will win But he never considered... he could buy assassin Ying But I did I wrote the secret letter I guess old man Ouyang Must have fallen for my trick I tempted him with the secret letter Then beat him at his own game Used him to kill the last powerful man, killing two birds with one stone Stop this nonsense, go to hell! You are so naive There must be only one Wei Zhongxian in the dynasty Buxiao, eunuch Li is right The eunuchs have been in power for decades Government positions at all levels of power Are penetrated by eunuch influence The roots run deep Once there are no restraints from Wei Zhongxian, the eunuchs will fight each other and it's the people who will suffer So, Wei Zhongxian must stay alive What can we do? This responsibility... let me bear it You? I will constrain the eunuchs gradually Destroy their influence in this country Brother Buxioa, There's no turning back from this choice Xiaodie, we will not meet again in this lifetime
