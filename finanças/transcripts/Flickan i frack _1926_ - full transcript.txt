- The Girl in Tails - A breezy film-story in 7 acts from the Hjalmar Bergman novel of the same name Director This is Wadkoping, a largish small town in the Kingdom of Sweden And this is Wadkoping's unchallenged monarch... Mrs Hyllenius, widow of the the cathedral dean. [Played by Karin Swanstrom] Wadkoping's co-ed school was famous far and wide... ...for taking into its fold the trio of youngsters... ...whose story with a moral we shall relate to you. Curry Kock - Wadkopings only, (well anyway the biggest) snob. [Erik Zellerstrom] Katja Kock and Ludwig von Battwyhl... The latter a nobleman, a count actually. [Magda Holm - Einar Axelsson] "No, Katja my dear, don't try to console me..." "I'm sure to fail the exam. You heard what Headmaster said." "Ludwig, what if you swotted for a whole month?!" "I'll stuff the last 7 years of lessons into you, in the month that's left." A few days after that significant conversation... "I'm just learning what it means to be a total blockhead!" "Katja, I'm as stupid as you are ugly." "Would you be so good as to parse at least SOME French irregular verbs!" Letter from State Railways rejecting an invention. Carl Axel Kock, unappreciated genius and father of Katja and Curry. [Nils Arehn] "Poor Katja, you got yourself a total idiot of a dad." "I sure did!" "Darn it? Do you think I'd go out with the top bird in town, wearing darned clothes? "You're right, I AM ugly!" "Of course you aren't ugly, Katja. You're pretty, but you lack class." "How can people appreciate your looks, when you dress like a cleaning-woman?" "Just take a look... This is my clothes money!" "Here you see in this house who gets to dress as he pleases!" The atmosphere was somewhat charged. But the big day finally arrived. "Everyone's ready!" This was the last year headmaster Starck was in charge at this establishment... ...from where so many graduation caps were flying out. [Georg Blomsteadt] "Actually, I didn't take an exam... Katja took two!" End of Act 1 The Girl in Tails Act 2 20 km south of Wadkoping lies the distinguished location of Larsbo... ...which surely belonged to the estate holder, Count Ludwig von Battwyhl. If there was no doubt as to the true ownership... ...there was uncertainty about the right of occupation and use. At different times the property was inhabited by a number of ladies... "The wild horde of learned women" who lived as they pleased... There was Dr Karolina Willman, neurologist. [Lotten Ohlsson] Lizzy Willman, associate professor of Nordic languages. Betty Willman, who philosophised on the shape of the nose. Brita Djurling, not an intellectual, but clever and capable. And last but not least, Lotten Brenner, lecturer in comparative anatomy. [Anna-Lisa Baude-Hansen] Have passed my matric, to the surprise of the teachers and everyone else. Will see you before long. Regards, Ludwig von Battwyhl "Girls it's true... he did pass." You'd be wrong to think the young count was going to rush home. It had become so pleasant in Wadkoping. "How lovely it is on such an evening, with the lake, the birches and everything." "But how incredibly stupid that we'll soon be saying goodbye..." "...without a parting fling!" " I know! We'll organise a bit of a ball at "Kupan" ". "A ball in June? Surely not!" Over the following days, Ludwig displayed all the energy he applied to everything... ...except studying textbooks. "Well you see, Auntie, we were thinking of having a little fling." "I mean a student ball at "Kupan."" "A ball in June? That's unheard of!" "It would work out alright, supervised by the headmaster and me." "But you'll have to talk to the headmaster yourself." "Perspiring... but successful!" The ball was scheduled for June 20. Katja realised she had three choices... She could agree to go to the ball... No, of course she must! Choice number 2... "How can people appreciate your looks, when you dress like a cleaning-woman?" There remained the 3rd, dangerous, choice... that led to Ekbom's store... ...the town's leading fashion house. I'm on my way to Ekbom's, to order an elegant gown for the ball. Then I'll find the daintiest stockings and smartest shoes in town. "Perhaps he'll begrudge me for being elegant for once in my life." End of Act 2 The Girl in Tails Act 3 "Daddy, would you like to give me 500 kronor?" "For heaven's sake girl, do you want to start a company?" "I need a new dress and things for the ball." "Curry got a new set of tails." "So he should. So would you, if you were a boy." "Anyway you've got several dresses." "Firstly, I can't help being a girl..." "...and secondly, I can't possibly wear the rags that I have." "So stay at home." "Daddy doesn't want me to go to the ball." "I could always get the things on credit." "I've already ordered stuff from Ekbom's and elsewhere." "Yes, I said Ekboms." "...and remember, you're not to do any work for my daughter without my approval." "Don't worry Daddy, I'll call the other people myself." "Year after year, I've gone around dressed like a cleaning-woman..." "...and you've seen fit to tell me that!" "I've always taken care of him and pampered him..." "...but that was what I was obliged to do." "I forgive him that he begrudges me looking elegant for once in my life." "What vexes me is Curry's new tails." "I can be humiliated, just because I'm a girl..." "...an unassuming, submissive girl." "I'm no sweet loveable child..." "I'm someone people look down their noses at." On June 20, a peaceful dusk enveloped Wadkoping. "You be careful on the stairs now!" "And please don't shout when you're conversing." "People are saying you're becoming a silly old man!" People were arriving at "Kupan" where everything was in readiness. "Colonel Edeblad... he may be fit, but he's just as stupid as his wife. "That was a fitting marriage." "Fatso Biorck there was the stupidest student in school." "He only finished junior high." "Yes, but Biorck is doing very well." A ball in Wadkoping is quite an event... It is carried out with the utmost security, thanks to the local Women's Council. "If the headmaster can't be here, that's no concern of ours." "The ball can begin!" "Music!" End of Act 3 The Girl in Tails Act 4 "She must've studied too hard with me. It's unhinged her." "Sorry to bother you, my dear Mr Blom." A girl in TAILS!" "Da capo, for 700 million, boys! Da capo, aren't you listening?" "Are you too damned cowardly to even say hello to me?" "My daughter doesn't talk to strange men. Kindly leave her alone." "No need to introduce yourself." "Everyone knows Bjorner, the lawyer who loses Dad's patent applications." "It's probably your fault I have to share my brother tails." "Tomorrow we'll have the priest post the banns..." "...and we'll go to the Congo as missionaries." "We can't stay here in Wadkoping." "But now you have to go home." "I'm not going home till I've gone through the program" "You just wait and see... this is only the beginning." "In cases of insanity, it's always the mind that suffers most." "You're quite right, uncle... this girl is a boy." "And now I'll tell you an amusing story..." Curry, our father can't afford to give us both evening clothes. Consequently we'll both have to share the tails. I plan to use them for the first half of the ball, and during supper, where I intend fixing myself a stiff drink. Then I'll chomp on a fat cigar and ask the headmaster for a light off his one, whereupon I'll slap the dean's widow on the back and thank her for a lovely evening After that, the tails are all yours. That's only fair Your devoted sister, Katja. "You're certainly a mischievous little imp..." "If you'd been one of my students, you'd have got a good thrashing...." "but now you're simply a young lady in disguise." "And I'm still not too decrepit to refuse a lady my protection." "Look, Madam, here's a little girl who'd like to curtsy to a revered lady." "If my eyes don't deceive me, that's a boy." "Certainly they're men's clothes but they do suit a woman." "It shows the sex can look good in any sort of costume." "Even when it's shameful?" "I share your view. Today's decolletage is becoming in questionable taste." "But Katja's dress is quite unrevealing with its high neck and covered arms." "Now boys, let me see you get to it and dance with Katja." End of Act 4 The Girl in Tails Act 5 The headmaster's intervention succeeded in changing the atmosphere and opinions. "Quiet! Come with me!" "Daddy, I won't come in til you promise to handle this calmly and objectively." "You little minx!" At 2.15 in the morning. Guard the girl, chaps, while I go and find us a cab. "G'day Aunt Karolina! Nice boys never drink punch!" "This kid isn't a boy, but a girl, disowned by an uncaring father." "She needs care and protection... and how are you all, anyway?" How the rosy complexion of determination turns into the sick pallor of reflection... "Your daughter Katja fled at 3.30 a.m. with Ludwig von Battwyhl, in one of Larsson's carriages." "By now, all of Wadkoping would know about it." "Why don't we get her on the telephone?" "We can't allow her to discredit herself any further." "Never mention her name again!" "If she wants to come within these walls, she can crawl here on bare knees!" Thus a couple of weeks went by... delightful for some... However, for others it was not quite so pleasant... End of Act 5 The Girl in Tails Act 6 Mr Kock did nothing to heal the wound and went on feeling sorry for himself. But there were those who did not accept this passive policy... "Not only does her seemingly morally-bereft father let her escape warning and chastisement..." "...but she has the effrontery to stay at Larsbo for another 3 weeks after the scandal." "This shameful behaviour should no longer be tolerated." "Of course something has to be done." "I think I know a punishment that is both effective and appropriate." One morning, shortly after those secret deliberations... GOOD AND BAD BEHAVIOUR IN THE YOUTH OF YESTERDAY AND TODAY This is the title of a series of seven articles on social history that will soon appear in this newspaper. The author is the well-regarded academic Edvard Paulin. The articles were prompted by a recent event in our community... an event which is still to be resolved... ...arousing indignant protests from from many quarters. "Don't you understand? Then you don't understand much!" "I'm sure a child would know what the 7th article will be about!" "I know! We'll get her back for a visit to the dean's widow!" "She wouldn't be received by the widow." "Besides, she has to crawl back of her own accord!" "Isn't this an appropriate time to get engaged?" "Or do you think that's silly?" "I really can't perceive why that would be silly." "If we're going to announce it, won't we need to pay some visits?" "There won't be many..." "Maybe a couple of hundred in the district..." "...and in town, just your friends and relatives and the Ruttenschiolds..." "...the Edelblads, old Bioners, Gustaf Biorner, Vilhelm Bioners, Erik Biorners, the Books, the Loewens, Uncle Jakob, Aunt Rosa, Aunt Fanny, Aunt Selmas, the Anfeldts, the Arnbergs and Mrs Hyllenius..." 20 minutes after the decision to marry, there was a thought... Suddenly something struck Katja that had never occurred to her before... "...and so I intend to dedicate myself to the fight against prejudice." "But to start, I can't be here any longer without doing my share..." "Therefore, I'd like to ask you to appoint me to the kitchen." "Fighting against prejudice is quite acceptable..." "But having you spoiling the good food here at Larsbo, is not!" Katja's problem of wanting to be helpful, was solved next morning. "Where's Katja?" "Damned smart idea, I have to say!" Just at this critical moment... Mr Katja Kock Larsbo Estate Do you realise who'll be written about in the seventh article? Sincerely, your brother Curry "What about it?" "If you're devoting your life to fighting prejudice..." "...small-town gossip shouldn't worry you." "We gladly share in our servants' happiness and sorrow..." "But this is hard to understand..." "Our family has never been the subject of an article on social history!" "Don't worry about what they write, my poppet!" "But I'll come out to Larsbo this evening anyway." They say that accidents seldom come singly. "Get inside quicksmart, kids! The count is going to ride Belzebub!" "Don't forget to close the chimney damper!" "...and as soon as his summer committments are over, he's sure to be riding Belzebub... "...a horse that goes berserk if you even whisper the word 'saddle'." "Last year he broke an ankle and a thumb" "The year before, three ribs and a forearm" "And before that, a collarbone and more." "Try and stop him Katja. You're the only one who can." "Let go of me!" "It looks bad having a maid with her arms around me." "I've been with him man and boy all his life..." "...so I thought it best to get all the stuff in order." End of Act 6 The Girl in Tails Act 7 "No danger children... Just a mild concussion." "He'll be back on his feet in a week." "Katja, will you promise me something without knowing what it is?" "So you've promised to visit grandma's cousin, Mrs Hyllenius." Three weeks later it was Thursday August 12 ...making the next day Friday the 13th Engaged: Katja Kock and Ludwig von Battwyhl Larsbo the 12th of August GOOD AND BAD BEHAVIOUR IN THE YOUTH OF YESTERDAY AND TODAY VII The young women of today ...displays an audacity of Renaissance intensity. For example, imagine a young girl publicly dressed in tails! And this in a fine old establishment known for its high moral tone! This example quoted is something that should arouse misgivings... These people think they are the final arbiters. But, as usual, it is God who decides everything. "Mixed in today's newspaper, my dear, were betrothal announcements and articles about scandals." "I guess you're happy now, you evil old woman..." "...since you spoiled the lass's engagement..." "...and made ugly a beautiful summer ." "In a way, I admit you're right." "I don't think young people should renounce good behaviour, either." "But how can we oldies lead the way if we're incapable of forgiveness." "If you can't forgive at your age, then you're to be pitied." "Soon you'll be at rest, able to move neither hand or foot, tooth or tongue." "Take my advice and get a nice pillow stuffed with fond memories." "For it will be a long sleep, my dear." "Neither hand or foot, tongue or tooth..." "No... it should be as I said... we go to the Congo as missionaries." "It's regrettable that Mrs Hyllenius won't let herself be reconciled..." "But now, my pet, you have to promise not to dress that way as long as I live." "That's not hard to do... there's not much sand left in my hourglass." "Depraved girl reformed in 2 minutes 13 seconds. A new world record." "It's simply not true!" "No, Paulin, it's not a lie, God be praised" "Worse lies than that have turned out to be true." Subtitles by FatPlank for KG The End.
