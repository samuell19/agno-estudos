Rapper Travis Scott wrapping up an unforgettable weekend in Houston. His sold-out Astroworld Festival on Saturday received rave reviews. Therefore I, Sylvester Turner, mayor of the city of Houston, hereby proudly proclaim November 18th, 2018 as Astroworld Day, Travis Scott Day! I grew up here my whole life. I was inspired by AstroWorld. In '05, when they took it away... it kinda took a big piece of my heart away. I didn't have anywhere to go. So, I just wanted to kinda bring back that feeling and give this city something they could always have, just fun to do. It's been hurricane after hurricane, disaster after disaster, they try to take us away, but... as long as we stick together and create, we don't need nothing special. We got each other... Man, at 10, 12, y'all right here, like... Y'all hold the future. It don't seem like it, 'cause you can't drive, don't have a driver's license, but yeah. Just use all the time that you can't go to the parties and the clubs to really start working on your future. It's lit! Huge for Houston and huge for Mo City. Huge for Travis, man. This is crazy. How are you? I'm so proud of you! Look at you! So, all that cursing out I did - in my office worked, huh? - It must've. - Look at you! - Jack, look! Hey, yo! I couldn't graduate school... - unless it was for this girl right here. - Yes, you could've. This lady. Oh, my God. She saved my life... in high school. Like, real life. Bro, I remember she came in my room. It was like, "You passed! Whassup?" I remember that. - Y'all called me. - I called, yeah. And she told me. She told me he was gonna be somebody. - She told me that! - Yeah, she did. Look at you! I remember that day when you told me that, you know what? This high school was just-- I just can't turn this music off. I remember that. I just can't turn it off! I saw him on the Days Before Rodeo tour with Thug and Metro, and we started out at the fucking small-ass venues, and then it's just intensified. Man, you created Astroworld and this tour, bro. To see you go from opening shows and no one knowing you... The pyro dude can just go home if he not gon' hit the fucking button. I want you to go through your light cues, make sure you're cool. You have the music, and we can continue doing that. Then that's what we do. So, I'm gonna let go of the departments that aren't-- - Nuh-uh. - All right. Cool. Everyone's right here till I go through this shit, and I'm-- I have yet to feel comfortable, bro. - Okay, cool. - From first song to last. Before I go home, lay down, I wanna do it. Before we go on tomorrow, I'm straight. Until then, nobody leaves. We've been at the Garden before on other people's tours, but... never had the whole house. I'm excited to see how lit the crowd gets. I wanna see, like, the audience moving up and down. My 19th time seeing Travis live. I'm trying to stage dive off the fucking nosebleeds tonight. Let's fucking go. Astroworld, baby! Fit of the Year, man. Tonight. Sold out. Roller coasters. We back at it again, but this time it's your fucking spotlight, your stage, your show. We need La Flame tonight. - La Flame! - Yessir. Dada? - Come here. - Say bye. Madison Square Garden, the world's most famous arena. Travis Scott, sold out. Why weren't you here? Astroworld, that's where you needed to be! And in the mosh pit... you're in there, you just have so much adrenaline. - Astroworld in this bitch, what's up! - Let's fucking go! I mean, it's fucking terrifying. I'll never ever forget this day. It's time to rage! It was a dream, man, seeing Travis. I was on a ride with Travis Scott. He's been my idol since I was 13... Everybody put one in the air for the number one song on the number one album again in the country! Three Grammy nominations!

You're still not lighting the base! There's no point if-- If I can't see them from where I'm at, nobody can see 'em. These lights along the roller coaster rails, I don't get no action. These lights on the side, I'm not getting no action! It's the same shit. It's not making sense. Who does the camera? - The director. - Okay. On "Stop Trying to Be God," it needs to be front and center. All that side shit is lame. You exposing how the shot is doing-- That's lame! It's like, nothing from behind. It needs to be all center. All front. Like, unless I'm moving out the way, all front.

Like, if lasers go out, lighting gotta tap in. You know what I'm saying? Be prepared for the moment 'cause I can't be instructing on stage. I look crazy. That's it. All right, cool. Other than that, it was cool. Hey! We going rah! I'm trying to design that new Houston sound. Where people can go out and have something to parade with. There's mad kids out there like me, like Don Toliver, who's on the album and shit. You know... It's just vicious. - That nigga came in hot. - Yessir. We heard Don Toliver for the first time, - maybe, what, like four, five months ago? - Man. This kid is, like, he thinking on some whole other shit. You know what I mean? I just gravitated to that. Yessir! Cactus Jack! Cactus Jack, you know what I'm saying? I'm from Houston, and you know, I'm a fan of Travis, of course, you know, and... My manager reached out to Johno, you what I'm saying? And, you know, we just vibed, and you know, he really believed in me. Travis just took heed to it, man, and... Either way it goes, he called me to the studio, and... all of a sudden, we get to the door. My nigga asked me, "You ready?" I looked at him. I said, "Yo, I'm ready. What's up?"

Travis Scott was confirmed as part of the Super Bowl halftime show, which is happening in just a few weeks. Of course, he was hit with a ton of backlash, but as we told you on Monday, - Travis required... - ...when the rumors were that Travis Scott was gonna do this, obviously Travis Scott knew what he was getting into. He knew the controversy... Travis's addition came with a stipulation. Michael B. Jordan, and the Reverend Al Sharpton, and others voiced their disapproval of Scott's choice. You gotta walk gingerly. Cultural equity, at the end of the day. As a people, we compromise in certain situations to get to better places. Is it blown out of proportion? Yes, because, honestly, why wouldn't a black artist want to not perform in one of the biggest events in the world? That don't help us! We need you to be on that stage! How many of these you did? - This is my 11th Super Bowl. - Damn! You did this with Beyoncé? Did it with Beyoncé. That was in New Orleans. That was great. Prince was... amazing. Damn. - And now Travis Scott. - Three, two, one. You know on that drum? The breakdown? The tch-tch? - Yeah. - That shit just sound corny, man. Looks like this might've been his first year. I mean, he was good at football and track. He could have done something in those sports. - All right, Jack! - Ah, God! Run, Junior! Run, Junior, run! Legs up. He got it! He in there. Yeah!
