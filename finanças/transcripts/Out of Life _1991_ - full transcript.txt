Beirut, o Beirut... Life is long when measured by heartbeats. Security officials estimate that the number of civil war victims from April 13th, 1975, to the present day total 148,600 deaths of men, women and children, including those killed in the 1982 invasion, 427,500 wounded, including the victims of the Israeli invasion… -They're here! -…25,000 disabled or handicapped, 5,000 kidnapped, and 20,000 missing. These numbers include the victims of the Israeli invasion. Get back! Get back! -Move it. -Get back! -Come on, move it! -He's taking pictures. Oh, my dear God! Where are you, brother? Khaled, my son! What did they do to you? They killed you, my son! God, help me! Khaled, my son! They took your life! That's Khaled's brother, the one who got killed. -What's happening here? -He wants revenge. I see, his brother was not among the freed hostages. Hussein! -Against the wall! -Your mother is here. Hussein! What are you doing, my son? What are you doing, my children? What do you think you're doing? I raised you to be a God-fearing man, someone who would know right from wrong. What you're doing is wrong. Leave! Go home! Go back to your mothers! Go, my son! Just go! Oh, God! God, spare us your wrath! Blood cries for blood! An eye for an eye! God, have mercy on us! Oh God, save us from this war. Hurry. OUT OF LIFE Call the ambulance! The Red Cross, follow us. Come on guys, to the choppers! To the choppers! Quick, to the center, ask them to send help! Sir, do you have a car? Help me! Patrick, take your pictures, and move! Hurry. Don't do that! I'm taking pictures! Bastards! No pictures! You have no business here, leave! Make the women stop screaming! I said, no pictures! I don't understand this war nor this wretched country! It makes sense when Israelis attack Palestinians, but Palestinians and Shiites fighting amongst themselves? Damn! I don't get it. Tell him to take a picture. Isn't he a photographer? -Let him take a picture. -Yes, tell him. Patrick, please take a picture. It's not worth getting killed over. -Hello, Bou Steph! -Hello -Patrick, where are you going? -Cigarettes. Don't be long. Ali, do you have Gitanes? -Are you Perrault? -Are you Perrault? Wait! Stand back! Don't move! Give me your passport! Come on, give me your passport. Is that really him? Perrault, Patrick. That's him. Don't take the road by the sea. Take the Wardieh instead. -Here, cover his head. -Cover your head, quickly. -We should've taken the guide as well. -What else could I do? Go faster. Take a right. Watch this scumbag! -Left? -Turn left. -Don't raise your head! -Stay still. -Come on! Hurry! -Ahmed! Lift your feet, you're crushing me. -Shut up! -Don't move. Come on, step out. Against the wall. -I want to talk to your boss. -Cool it. Here, eat -I'm not hungry. -Eat what we give you! You can take the bag off. Don't you turn around! Three children were killed by a bomb in West Bekaa dropped by the Israelis during the 1982 Israeli invasion. The names of the children are Yehia and six-year-old Said Mohammad Ghazzawi, two brothers, and their friend… Scared, you prick? Listen, it's surely a mistake. We'll publish your picture tomorrow and you'll be the talk of the town, prick. You'll be famous. Stop worrying. They're here! What have you done? Are you idiots? Have you lost it? I asked to wait till nightfall! -Did you check his passport? -Yes, it's him, Patrick Perrault. We can't take him now. Either we wait till nightfall or… We can't wait. Hassan saw everything. Put him in the trunk. Come on! -Help me. -We're here? Start walking. Move! -Easy, to the left -You're already here? Get inside. Take off your clothes, but keep your underwear on. -Poor guy. -Hurry. Hurry. Faster. Face the wall. -Faster, we're in a hurry. -Make it swift. -It's wet. -I just washed it. She just washed it. Give me your watch. Come. Watch out. Mustafa, blindfold him and take the bag. -Close your eyes. -Give him the blindfold. Come on, move it. -Hurry. -Let's move. Easy now. Guide him. Slowly. -Get inside. -Turn the lights on. Move. Sit. Feel that? It's a mattress. You sleep here Remove the blindfold when we leave. But listen, put it back as soon as you hear the door open. This is very important, because if you see our faces, you're dead. -Give him his stuff. -Here. -What's this? -For your toileting. -That can wait. -You might need it. But you said this was all a mistake. Maybe, I'm not sure. That's why we need to interrogate you. -Okay, I can answer you right away. -Our boss will be the one to do it. -Are you okay? Any illnesses? -No. When does your boss get here? This one's for water. This one's for peeing. We'll take you to the toilet once in the morning and once at night. Morning and night? What does that mean? Will I be stuck here for days? I can't! My plane leaves tomorrow. They're waiting for me. It's very quiet in here. Nobody ever shouts or gets angry. Don't make a scene, and don't call upon the guards. They'll bring you everything you need. Get up. Leave him. Let's go. Shit. Put the blindfold back on, come on! What's this mess? Why did you spill your pee on the floor? You're disgusting. I heard that the French were dirty, but not like this. -I was putting the blindfold on. -And now there's pee everywhere! Clean your mess! Then you can go to the bathroom. There's a stalemate in the battle zone in East Beirut after a shooting that killed a girl and injured her parents in the vicinity of the Khabbaz Gallery. Rockets were fired over Nahr El Mout… Hurry up. Everything will be okay. All is well. Relax, it will pass. Are you crazy? Who are you talking to? -To yourself? -To nobody. You're crazy. Come on, be quick! You can't refuse what we give you. We're giving you what you need to eat. You have to finish your meals. I can't eat this disgusting crap! We eat that "crap" too, asshole. You're no better than us, so eat up, or get hurt! -You used the wrong word. -Eat! I won't eat before I'm interrogated. I don't want anything. As you wish. But if you don't eat, you'll die. If I die, you'll be in trouble. Do you think people care about any deaths in Beirut? I wouldn't be just any death. I'm a journalist. I'm French. Screw you and screw France! Nobody knows who you are. He told me to choose the color, so I went with pistachio. Nice, huh? What's wrong with a green BMW? -What about this one? -Let's make it green. I want a bright color. Red is better. Hussein, start the generator. I want to drink! I'm thirsty! I want some water! -I need water-- -Keep your mouth shut. If you utter a sound, I'll come in and hit you. Get me water. I'm ending my hunger strike. There's no water here. The taps don't work at night. You'll get your water tomorrow morning. How many hours till morning? -Give me water. -Why did you light a candle? You shouldn't waste those. -It's morning. There's daylight. -How am I supposed to tell? Listen to the muezzin to know the time. -I do listen, but I don't understand it. -You'll see light soon enough. -When is the interrogation? -Shut up! I told you to shut up! Never talk outside your cell and don't ask questions. -Are there other hostages? -Shut up and do what you're told! Oh, God. They removed the mirrors! -Where are the mirrors? -What mirrors? -The French guy is crazy. -Why did you remove the mirrors? Come on, get a move on. Why do you need a mirror? Your personal vanity? You're taking too much time. You can't stay for more than five minutes. There's no toilet paper. Improvise. Rinse your ass. Figure it out! Why are you here? Are you sick? No, but I will be if I stay here in the dark. I need light. There's no power because of the bombing. You're lying. I can see light. It's from the lantern. You think I'd give that to you? -I'll get you another candle. -Will I get another afterwards? We'll see. Eat now. Here. Give me your hand. A labneh sandwich with olives. How do you say olives in French? It's "Olive". What is that? It's shit. I'm turning to shit, too. True, you don't smell too good. I can't wash properly like that. I could get an infection. You'd better not! We have no medicine here. That's why it was so stupid to go on hunger strike. We would have had to "liquidate" you. Here, it's eau de cologne. Do I smell bad? Tell me the truth. You don't, but your room does. I'll lose it if I don't get out soon. Have hostages ever gone mad? I haven't been a guard here before. Wow! What a color! Who is the BMW king of Beirut? -Who's the king? -Abu Steph! Come on, show us! He's acting wild tonight! Why's the fool in the dark? -Why are you in the dark, moron? -Why is he so slow with the blindfold? Get the blindfold on quick next time, or we'll kill you. -That's not what he said. -We'll kill you. -Do you need anything? -Do you understand? Do you need anything? When will you interrogate me? You don't need anything. You're still looking pretty. All pink and cute. -You have a woman's hair. -Don't touch me! I'll give you a hard time! -What did he say? -He's bored. -Are you translating correctly? -Yes, I told him you're bored. What do you need? I understand some Arabic, and a boss like you must understand French. So interrogate me. Get it over with! I'm going out of my mind! This isn't a prison. In prison you have books, exercises… Why should I be in prison anyway? Don't shout. We'll bring you chicken and some tangerines. -Is he going to interrogate me? -We're getting you tangerines. Keep your damn tangerines! Why are you here? To gloat? You journalists always want to know why. And you don't? Why are we here? You, me, all this? God knows! God doesn't know why I'm here, neither do you. No one knows! You must have done something bad to be here. What? What have I done wrong? Think. You've nothing else to do. Move it. Nice! Is that a double six? Do you know that Frankenstein guy well? Who's Frankenstein? The guy with the Kalashnikov who keeps touching me. You call him Frankenstein? Is he gay? Oh, come on! He's a good fighter, very brave. Don't provoke him, he can be dangerous. Do you have a name for me? -I haven't thought of one. -Choose one for me. -Philippe. -Philippe? I like it. Your turn. I'll give you an Arabic name. "Naoum". It means gentle and kind. It's my brother's name. No, don't change my name. It's Patrick Perrault. Don't change it. We all change names. They call me Ali, but that's not my real name. -I have no need to change it. -You're like us. In Arabic, we say, "A fair man will do to you as he would do to himself." You had enough, Naoum? Don't change my name. -You like Lebanon? -Yes, why? You've lived well here. Foreigners always do. The beach, the sun, good food, skiing in Faraya. -I love your country for more than that. -Liar. If you were happy, why did you want to leave? -Leave? -Don't lie to me. You had a ticket for Paris. We know why you were leaving. Your embassy said so. I hardly went there. You did. You went to the Embassy's reception. You even bought a suit from Jacob's in Hamra for July 14th. What about it? We know all about you. -Was it Hassan? -Poor Hassan. You killed Hassan? I know these beads. Yellow amber. I bought them in Sanayeh You were in my flat, and you've searched through my stuff. You took my rosary collection. Abu Steph, open the door. Shit! I'll show you! What did you do? You're in deep shit! An innocent man doesn't try to escape. He waits for his verdict. -What verdict? -Get up. -Get up. -I wanted some fresh air. -What do you call this? -A knife. No, it's a razor. They're not the same thing. A razor can go deep. So deep, the wound won't heal. You'd need stitches. And we can't do stitches here. I won't cut your throat, only your ear. I hate you, bastard! Don't utter a word! Shut up! Stand up! Calm down, Mustafa, Walid's here! Walid's here! Your conscience isn't clear. Reflect, and ask for God's forgiveness. Keep the tape straight and tight. Remove the blindfold. Close your eyes. Abed, remove his blindfold. The face too. You can go! Out of the way! Stop, turn off the full beam. -There's nothing here. -Go, move it! Come on, hurry up. Take the shoulders. Pull. -Come on, pull. -He's so heavy! Put him down. Stay there. Good night. I'm not a spy, I'm a journalist. What's the matter, Naourn? Naoum? Naoum? Naoum! Wake up! It's you Philippe? Untie me! -Calm down. -Untie me. Calm down, I'll untie you. -Philippe, I want to go home. -Calm down. I want to go back home. Close your eyes. It'll be alright. Calm down. Philippe, don't leave me. -Take him to the cellar. -Don't leave me. I'm cold. You speak English, don't you? Look. Bring the horse, Abed. Move it, guys! To the cars! Was it you shouting? I'll put you back in the cellar. -No, it wasn't me. -Who was it then? Answer me! It wasn't me. I know I'm not allowed to shout. Naoum? We found this at your place. Merry Christmas. Cut it out. You haven't even announced my capture. "And didn't you see, in my wildest outburst, that my heart resents my mouth at all times?" You're not correcting my mistakes. You're not listening. I'm sorry. Start over. You don't give a damn. You don't want to teach me. I know why. You hate me. -No. -Yes, because I'm guarding you. There was nothing else I could do. I want to live. I'm from Aitaroun. A poor village in the South It's under Israeli occupation. There's no future for me in this country. After high school, I want to go to France to study computer science. Do it. You're free. Free? What are you talking about? But we can visit France right here in Beirut. Just look at the street names. Rue Jeanne D'Arc. Rue Verdun, Rue Justinian. Rue Clemenceau, Avenue Charles De Gaulle. I can help you. Naoum, my friend, now you're lying to me. We'll go to the French embassy. We'll meet with the ambassador. I'll tell him, "That's my friend, Philippe. Thanks to him, I'm here today." Shut up. I may have an idea. But not a word to the others. It'll be our secret, okay? Against the wall. -So, how is it going? -Good. I hope the guys treat you well. Yes, they do. What about the one you call Philippe? Philippe is a good student. I'm giving him French lessons. What happened today? Today? Nothing. You didn't talk about France and studying in Paris? It's normal to talk about these things. You didn't talk about the French Embassy? We'll question Philippe, and he'll confess in the end. Everybody always confesses. If you lied, you'll regret it. You tried to trap Ali, you coward. That's real bad. You're done here. You're going to die. -Stop it. I'm hurt. -You deserve all this Because you're evil. My ear hurts. I have an infection. I hope they pick me to be the one to kill you. -I'm ready. -For what, scumbag? Do it now. I don't care. I brought you some medicine for your ear. I have a nice present for you, dirtbag. It's a black tie. To mourn your friend Philippe. We've just executed him. Philippe thought he could change his life through study. As if a Shiite could get anywhere in this country. It will be hard for his mother. I'll have to tell her. We're from the same village. -Do you know the South? -I covered the Israeli invasion. Do you know Aitaroun? I fought the Israelis there. I was with the Palestinians. Then I fought the Palestinians in Beirut. First, I was with the communists. Then the PLO, and later Amal. Then, I forget. Today, I'm with Islam. We'll change the world. -You change sides a lot. -True. I do change sides. But war never changes. You've seen nothing yet! I beg you, don't shoot! Don't shoot, please! Cut it out! Get up, you're being ridiculous. The job is ridiculous. I'm a fighter not a prison guard. He's driving me nuts. Sometimes I think he's innocent, and I feel like freeing him. Sometimes I hate him, like all foreigners, and feel like killing him. -I've had enough! -That's enough. These are his clothes. Tell him to get dressed. We're freeing him. -Is that true? -Just translate. Put your clothes on, quickly. You'll be free. It's not true, you want to kill me. -Tell him not to worry. -We're not killing you. We're freeing you. -When? Tonight? -Yes, tonight. -Tell him maybe today. -Maybe tonight. Let him tidy up. He'll get a shave and a haircut. Don't let him forget the photo of the girl. Well, are you happy? I'm happy. I get to fight again! The heat's turned up! This is the big one! What day is it today? Naoum, my friend You're going to be released. Why worry? Philippe, is it you? -They said… -They lied. But I did get into trouble. What's going on? It's been like that all day. The war started up again. Why would you care? Close your eyes. If the Ambassador keeps his word and the chief's brother is released, you'll be freed as well. How will it be done'? They didn't say. They don't trust me anymore. The Syrians will get me, right? I bet it's them. I'll contact you through the AFP in two weeks. You promised to help me get a visa. Don't forget, I'm your friend. I can't believe you're alive. Why did they lie? Help! Get me out of here! Walid! Walid! Get me out of here! Get me out! Don't move. Wait! Take the legs. Take him upstairs. -On your knees! -You can't do this. I'm getting freed. Look who's here. Did they free the chief's brother? There's no chief and no brother. There's just you and me. Do that again, and I'll kill you! The rules are the same here. -You're being too rough. -Pick him up. Get up. -He hurt me. -It's okay. Be careful. Sit right here. Here are your clothes. I was to be freed. You miss France, don't you? I like France. I like French footballers. Platini is ace. He's a God. See? I have nothing against France. They call me Omar. Do you remember me? Get up! Turn left. Stay here, don't move. Let me shave first. My T-shirt is filthy. Remove your blindfold. Remove it completely. Look ahead. Look this way. I'm currently paying… for the policy of colonialism, and for businesses which go against the interests of a deprived people in favor of gun merchants… Should it be "gun-runners"? I ask my government… to seriously consider the claims… Isabelle, I've had it. I'm tired. I'm desperate, exhausted… I am drowning in an endless night. Maybe I won't see you again nor get out of here alive. Don't stop. Isabelle I don't know about you, but thinking of you keeps me going. Do you ever think of me? Do you think of me, Isabelle? Tell me! Shit, it's not working! Cut! That's it! -This crap technology! -What's wrong? I can fix the camera. Calm down, don't touch the camera! Come on, let's go. What do you want? Why are you bothering me? My stomach aches. I need to go. Morning and evening only. It's night now. No toilet at night. But you forgot yesterday. We didn't forget. We don't trust you. You cheat. You only half-cover your eyes. You peek. Please, it hurts. You peek, I tell you! It's okay. You're not even bleeding. Now, forget about your stomach-ache. What's wrong? What happened? What is it? I need help. Get me a doctor. We can't. No one can know where you are. Blindfold the doctor then. Make him swear not to tell. No, it can't be done. No one can help you here. You'll have to get better on your own. You'll let me die… slowly… and you're going to stand by and watch. No, you mustn't die! Make an effort, please! -Why are you turning it down? -Be quiet! -Perrault is sick. He might call for us. -Stuff Perrault. Get him a nanny. That's enough, Fadi! Come, I have the injection. Here, let me try. Now you have to pray. You know, don't you? You must know one prayer. Pray to your God. Forgive us our trespasses… Breathe, but don't turn around. What does it matter? I'm going to die. Scared I'll tell Satan to keep an eye out for you? Don't talk like that. You're not going to die. And don't be mean to me. I've been kind to you. Put your blindfold on. If anyone comes, I'll be in trouble. Here, it's sweet tea. I'll throw up. The doctor told Walid you'd need three shots to feel better. Drink it. You have to hold out. Think of Isabelle. Who told you about Isabelle? You did, the other day, when we tried to film you. You were already sick. You seem to love her a lot. That's Isabelle. She's very pretty. It tastes funny. I put a drop of cognac in it, to make you strong. You're a lucky guy. You have a beautiful woman. You're rich, handsome and French. What if I told you that in Paris, I have a tiny flat… a clapped-out old car… and no unemployment benefits for a whole year. -Would you understand that? -No, but it doesn't matter. It's good that you have Isabelle. You'll marry and have kids. Family is so important. Your society is rotten because you have no sense of family. You put your parents in homes! Are you married, Omar? Do you have kids? I will, one day. I'll teach my son to respect his family. Family is like justice, and I want to be a just man. Hello. Good hunting today? Nothing. -How are things, Grouchy? -Hey. You're not in the mood today. I liked Dalida. She was born in Cairo, you know? Do you know any Lebanese singers? I like Fairuz. -I even know her songs. -I don't believe you. -It's like a night-club in here! -Omar, take the TV and get out! -What's Walid doing here? -I don't know. What? You aren't blindfolded. You can see. -I don't know. -Ask him. He doesn't know. He doesn't know? It's a chain. What's the chain for? -Chains are for dogs, not men! -Why are you always so angry? Calm down. No! -Stop it! -Shut up! Shut up. Omar! Continue the game. I'll be back. It's not my fault. I can't do anything. Don't be mad at me. -It'll get infected. -No, it's just a graze! I could die of blood poisoning from that. I'll talk to Walid. Walid doesn't decide anything. Listen, when I leave tonight, I'll take it off. It'll rest your ankle. But put the padlock back before you go to sleep. -What's wrong? -I have bad news -What? -Platini just retired. Fadi, Omar! The Frenchie has escaped! On your knees, now. I'm going to kill you! Scared, huh? Death doesn't scare us. That's why we're invincible. Here, say goodbye to her. This is not a hotel, it is a prison Start counting. At three, I'll shoot. One… two… three! -You wet yourself, asshole! -Are you crazy? Let go of me, Omar. Come on! Sit. Don't be scared. I'm a prisoner too. We're alone. Take your blindfold off. Leave me alone. I'm sick of your games. I'm Farid. You must be from the embassy. There's another Frenchman here? So, you're the journalist. You're wary of me, I know. You think I'm not a hostage, that I'm here to trap you. Look at me and you'll understand. I'm not wearing a blindfold. They don't care if I see their faces. I'm of no value to them. What have you done? Why are you here? Nothing, I'm a Christian who lived in West Beirut among Muslims. I even worked with aid groups in the South. Now, I only know one thing. They're going to kill me. What about me? You're too valuable. You'll live. I'm scared. I'm really scared. -Leave that, you don't need it anymore. -Get up! -Let go of him! -Come on, leave him! And you, don't move! Get up! -No! -Faster! No! Come on, hurry up. Stand still. Put him inside. Tarek! Wash your hands before lunch. Open the trunk. -Thank you guys. -Go. You may go. He didn't eat. -He hasn't eaten for three days. -You can have that. -He wants to die. -Let him die! Who cares? I'd do the same in his position. Mustafa? Mustafa! Don't leave me here, Mustafa! Don't let me die, Mustafa! It's only mortar fire. -It's right on us. -I know. My car is outside. So the bombs have revived you, have they? Don't be scared. I'll move the car. Don't move! Don't be afraid. Don't be frightened Don't be afraid. I'm here. Come here, sweetie! Don't worry, I'm here now. -This mustn't happen again. -He went there out of fear. He is scared of the bombs, and of you. -Lower your voice. -Don't you realize? This place is a prison. We can't laugh and talk, or see anyone! We're hostages too, just like that poor devil rotting in there! That's enough! To your right. Put it all in the bucket. Do it. -Who is it? -Najat. This is Najat, Walid's wife. She has a gift to thank you for being kind to her son. Reach out. Thank you, Najat. It's a nice gift. Don't bother, she doesn't speak French. -ls she pretty? -No, she's huge. I can see her feet. They're slender. And her ankles too. Yes, but she's fat from there up. Najat, are you pretty? Yes, pretty. That's enough! Back to work! I'm expecting a call. Stop flirting! Get the door. I envy them. To think we're in the same city! You envy their ignorance? Time for bed. Ahmad died in battle. What is it? What's wrong? Oh, my God! -Najat! -Oh God! My brother! Oh, my dear brother! Hello? Yes. Where exactly? When? We'll freshen him up. Okay. Very good. Dress the Frenchie. What's going on? -Here, put these on. -No. I'm sick of this transfer shit! -I won't get out, I'm begging you. -Calm down. Please, I want to stay here. I swear I'll behave. Let me stay here. Don't you understand? We're setting you free. Close your eyes. -Come now. -Move it. Move it. Do you remember Ahmed? Frankenstein to you. He died tonight. He was Najat's brother. The hotel is not far. Go via the beach, it's faster. The embassy people are waiting. You speak French! Go on. Good luck! It's him. He's here! I'm Patrick Perrault. I've just been released.
