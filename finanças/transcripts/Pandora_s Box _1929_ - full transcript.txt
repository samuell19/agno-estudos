The restoration of this film was supported by the Initiative for Digitization of the Federal Government's Representative for Culture and Media, after a resolution of the German Parliament. Pandora's Box premiered on February 9, 1929 in Berlin and wasn't a success at the time. The film became famous after the rediscovery of Louise Brooks in the 1950s, initiated by her admirers Henri Langlois of the Cinémathèque Française and James Card of Eastman House. As far as we know, neither the original negative nor a print has been preserved from the year of its production. The only material available are prints made in the 1950s and 1960s from heavily damaged negatives. The only way to show Pabst's images again in their original beauty was digital restoration. Three surviving prints were put at our disposition: a negative, made in 1952 by the Cinémathèque Française, a print of 1970 from the Gosfilmofond of Russia and a print of 1964 from the Národní Filmový Archive in Prague. The prints were given to us by those archives and the Cinecitta di Bologna. Combining those three prints, it was possible to restore the sequence of Pabst's famous flowing montage and to replace the missing frames and scenes as far as possibe. With digital restoration we tried to match the photographic characteristics of the different material in order to create a stylistic whole. Some damages still remain, for the time being. From the restored version we made 35mm negatives and prints, as well as a digital copy. The editing follows closely a working print Enno Patalas made in the 1980s for the Munich Film Museum. The intertitles are from a list Gero Gandert found in the Swedish Riksarkivet.

HORSETZKY Directed by GEORG WILHELM PABST ACT ONE You've done well for yourself! We haven't seen each other in such a long time! Are you still dancing? You've forgotten everything. You should have stayed with me. In that old garret? I'd have run away for sure. This newspaper editor Dr. Schön looks after you nicely, but one friend doesn't guarantee our future. We must put you on the stage for all the world to see! And I've brought just the man to do that. His name is Rodrigo Quast, and he wants to stage a big variety act with you. Dr. Schön is coming! I'm getting married! You won't kiss me just because you're getting married? The whole town is talking about us. I'm jeopardizing my position. Don't you see that we must put an end to this? You'll have to kill me to get rid of me. He was my first... patron! One did the best that one could. END OF ACT ONE ACT TWO "Minister of the Interior Dr. von Zarnikow wishes to announce the marriage of his daughter, Charlotte Marie Adelaide, to Dr. Ludwig Schön, Editor in Chief." I'm warning you again, my child: Dr. Schön's behavior makes this marriage impossible! Don't worry, Father. I don't care about gossip! Alwa, here are the costume designs for your revue! How's Lulu? Father must give her up. His marriage can't be postponed any longer. The famous Rodrigo Quast wants to do a big variety number with me! We're already rehearsing! Alwa is my best friend, the only one who never wants anything from me. Or do you want nothing from me because you don't love me? My dear Geschwitz, you must design a costume like that for me too! Is she really this beautiful? I thought I told you never to visit me! I didn't come to see you! Please get me volume K of the dictionary. Then it's settled - come see me tomorrow. Why don't you marry Lulu, Father? One doesn't marry such women! It would be suicide! What did she want here? I believe she wants to break into show business. Someone wants to stage a trapeze act with her. No, not a trapeze act! She'll appear in your revue. She can dance a bit. My newspaper will guarantee her success. Just one thing, my boy: Beware of that woman! END OF ACT TWO ACT THREE Nonsense! You should have done the trapeze act with me! I'm not going on! You must talk some sense into her! Maybe we'll do that variety number after all! I'll dance for the whole world, but not for that woman! Tell them to start! Where's Lulu? No smoking here! Satisfied now, Alwa? Now I'll marry Lulu! It'll be the death of me! END OF ACT THREE ACT FOUR I'd be a real scoundrel if I didn't lay a rose on my little Lulu's bridal bed! Father, I'm going away tonight... for a long time. He's my father! If only you'd come with me! I can't live without you any longer! You'll miss your train! Take it! Kill yourself! Kill yourself so that you don't drive me to murder as well! END OF ACT FOUR ACT FIVE Your Honors... I've painted a bleak picture of a tragic life. Gentlemen of the jury, look at this woman. Have I not shown that this woman did not commit murder, that her husband was the victim of tragic circumstances? Has the son of the deceased not spoken in her defense? No, this unfortunate woman is no murderess. You must acquit her, for she is innocent! Your Honors and gentlemen of the jury! The Greek gods created a woman - Pandora. She was beautiful and charming, and versed in the art of flattery. But the gods also gave her a box containing all the evils of the world. The heedless woman opened the box, and all evil was loosed upon us. Counsel, you portray the accused as a persecuted innocent. I call her Pandora, for through her all evil was brought upon Dr. Schön! The arguments of defense counsel do not sway me in the least. I demand the death penalty! Counselor, do you know what would have become of your wife if as a child she'd had to spend her nights in cheap cafés? is sentenced to five years in prison for manslaughter, minus 4 1/2 months for time already served. Fire! Fire! END OF ACT FIVE ACT SIX PASSPORT - ALWA SCHÖN How dare you come here?! Where else should I go but home? If you feel at home here, where my father bled to death, then I must leave! Is this the state prosecutor's office? Please give me Prosecutor von Bodungen! This is Alwa Schön. Any news on the escapee? We'll go away together. Countess Geschwitz will lend me her passport. PASSPORT - COUNTESS AUGUSTA GESCHWITZ I have the lady's baggage. 5,000 MARKS REWARD "RECEIVED WITH THANKS - MARQUIS CASTI PIANI" May I prove my friendship by offering some good advice? Don't go to Paris - too many prying eyes. Come with me instead. I know a place that's hospitable and discreet. END OF ACT SIX ACT SEVEN And Lulu's stayed here the whole three months? It's a fine hotel - hospitable and discreet! What can I say? It's our livelihood. I just got engaged. I'm going to stage a fantastic variety act with my fiancée. We just need 20,000 francs for sets and costumes. You must get me that money! Ask Alwa for it. Perhaps he won today. If I could just keep on playing, I'd win it all back. That lucky devil gets everything! You should only play when you're sure you'll win. How much? 300 pounds! The German police would give me 250 pounds any day. Three hundred it is, then. I'll go book a cabin. He's acting like he wants to buy me. I need money badly, and you have none to give me. The Egyptian will give me 50 pounds more than the German police. You're in luck! I'm looking out for your future. The police will never look for you at his establishment in Cairo. Hurry and get dressed. You leave in an hour. I won't be sold. That's worse than prison. I need the money. If you're not ready in an hour, I'm calling the police! Alwa, you have to win... or else I'm done for. I'm warning you: If I don't have those 20,000 francs by tonight, I'm turning you in! Money... they all want money! Go ahead and cry, my child. Rodrigo wants to turn me in. Save me! I'll take care of him! I know how we can all get out of this mess. Countess Geschwitz is sweet on you, and she has money. Be nice to her and she'll cough up the dough for sure. You're the only one who can save me! Rodrigo is madly in love with you! Throw yourself at him. He'll do anything for you. Otherwise he'll turn me in! Calm down, my dear. You'll soon have your money! Police! Let's get out of here! I'll get a boat! Police! Police! We must find a ship to take us to London! END OF ACT SEVEN ACT EIGHT We take only to give to others. Brother, how can I help you? No one can help me! It's strange how you can get booze on credit... but not bread. Why all the paint? We like you just the way you are. Too bad. I'd have liked to taste Christmas pudding once more before I die. WARNING TO THE WOMEN OF LONDON! FOR SOME TIME NOW... A MAN HAS BEEN LURING WOMEN INTO DARK PLACES IN ORDER TO MURDER THEM. WOMEN AND GIRLS SHOULD NOT GO OUT UNACCOMPANIED AT NIGHT. I have no money! Come along anyway. I like you! You're under the mistletoe. You must let me kiss you.
