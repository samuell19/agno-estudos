I appreciate you all, thank you thank you. Good, welcome, welcome. Okay you're welcome here, just don't be alone. That's the thing, don't be alone, goddamnit. Hey everybody! Sorry I'm late, but I came bearing gifts. Got some bread from the bakery they gave it free. Who wants some, who wants some, get some! Hey Tai, come on. Sit down will you? The world don't care for your excuses. Don't interrupt the session like that. Hey I told you, just sit down. Andy, meet Tai, Tai meet Andy. Tai, that's a cool name. I've been helping Andy to get used to this newly unemployed phase, right? Showing him that God, it doesn't matter how dark it gets, light can always be found. I used to be a loan officer for a private bank, but the market shit the bed and you know how that goes, right? Here I am, you know? Andy wants to improve himself, find some new meaning in his life, maybe even find a job that you can enjoy. Right, so I'm here to help him to reach that, just like I have been doing with you. If you don't mind me asking man, what exactly has Miles been helping you with? I came out here four years ago to play basketball at UCLA. Everything was going perfect until I tore my ACL my first game of my sophomore year. After that I just kind of lost my way. Miles here been helping me get back on the right path. Now what? You two gonna kiss? Is he always like this? With your Hallmark moment. Go on. ♪ Ebony and ivory ♪ Now, we all want to get off the streets don't we? We all want to hang onto our dreams. Don't let 'em go. You let your dreams go, and they've gone, like Tai, the comic book thing. He has the comic book thing. He's gonna hang onto that. Don't waver, don't waver, just keep focused, and Shake, you've got the, well you've got the vodka thing okay? Hang onto the vodka. Okay Kenny, you'll get a green card, okay? You will, you will, just hang in there. So 'til next week I guess, right? Same place, 9:30 Thursday, whatever. My goal I just want to say is you know, I want to get off the street and get back at a bank, so I know this is kind of crazy to say, but I'm gonna help you guys. I feel I can help you, you know? It's only a matter of weeks before I get a good job offer, and so you know, if you have some creative ideas or companies you want to start, I'm gonna be able to come back, because what you guys did for me, I'm not gonna forget that all right? So just remember that I said that today, and you know when the time is right, you'll find me. So let's get out of here before the cops come. Okay, thanks guys. Excuse me miss, can I give you a ride? I don't know, are you a good driver? Driving is what I do best. All right. Get in. - So where to Mrs.... - It's Miss. And the name is Natasha. Natasha. And your name is? Me? Matembo. Oh you're African huh? Yes indeed. So where are we going? Oh I know a place. Tell me what you would do to me if you were my man. First I would blindfold you. Like this? Just like that. Then I would handcuff you to the bed. - Oh really? - Yeah. Go on. Now I would massage every body part of you. I would kiss you from head to toe. And then I would, I would pitch my comic book idea to your father. What? Damn it Taiye! You selfish ass! I'm sorry. That's it, it's over. I can't believe I gave you another chance! What do you mean? I figured we would do some role playing today. You would tie me up, slap me around a little like I like, but you had to make it all about Taiye, again. Again! You know what? I cared for you. And I still care for you. Let's just start over, let's just... No no that's my last straw with you. I can't do this anymore. Could you please just get your stuff and leave? Please? Fine. If that's what you want. Hey, you think you can give me some gas money? Taiye speaking. Ah I'm good, I'm good. How are you doing? Yes I absolutely can. I'm driving right now, but I can send it over to you immediately. I certainly will, thank you so much. Stop, stop! Don't touch me! Do you think that you could just take my car and get away with it? - You gave it to me! - No you listen to me. Don't touch me! You're nothing but a young, dumb, cum-swallowing stripper who's good for one thing only, making me money. Don't you ever call me a dumb stripper. I am an entertainer! You think you can touch me? There! Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa. Girl, girl what did you just do? Yo, you good? What the? what the hell is going on? Oh my god! Girl! Oh my god. I'm good. Are you okay? Fuckin' bitch, she's dead. Oh babe, babe... That bitch is dead. We gotta get out of here, oh my god. Thanks. You're the chick that was fighting with that guy. Yeah, thanks. Hey I didn't get the name! It's Doll, call me Doll. I'm Taiye. Just call me Taiye. Jesus Christ Taiye, can you keep it down? Doll. I dig it. ♪ You will be disqualified ♪ ♪ One two three four ♪ ♪ Six seven ♪ Mr. Extraordinary, wanna go? Can't stop Mr. Extraordinary. Boom you're dead! What? You can't kill me with a lightning bolt. I'm Mr. Extraordinary. You can't make up a fake superhero. What do you mean fake? Don't make me use my real powers on you, punk. You two, throw me that ball. You call your brother a punk? Let's get one thing straight. I'm the only one that can call names up in here, and I don't even use that term. He said I couldn't kill him with a lightning bolt. Oh. So you two are superheroes. Well Jordan, since you so bad, strike me with a lightning bolt right now. And you Taiye, what's all this commotion about some monkey junk comic books? When you should be focusing on your coffee and cabbage. What's your coffee and cabbage? Your coffee is your stimulus. A little dab here and there is okay, but if you abuse it, you'll just be another drunk junkie. Now your cabbage, that's your necessity. It's your air. It's your water. It's the way you survive in this godforsaken world. Know the difference. Security! Wait a minute, here I come! This isn't a laundromat. Get your stuff and go. My bad. Let's go! I want that one! I want that one. Wait right here. Can I have a dollar? Hi, how old are you? - I'm 10 years old. - 10? - Oh you're so cute, hi! - Hi. - How old are you? - I'm 10. You guys are big. You guys are almost bigger than me. Aww, what grade you guys in? I'm in fifth grade. Fifth, you doing good in school? Yes. What do you want to be when you get older? I want to be a makeup artist, singer, and an actress. I need a makeup artist. Oh my god you guys are so cute. Can you guys do me a favor? - Yeah. - Sure! Never ever forget your dreams. Okay I won't. And you never let anyone treat you like an object. You're more than that okay? Since you guys doing good in school, I'mma give you that dollar okay? But you have to share it. - Thank you! - You're welcome. - Are you stalking me? - What? Don't flatter yourself. I've been coming here for the past two years. I'm thinking you're starting to follow me. Ha, never. It's Doll right? I could never forget a name like that. Aw that's funny. I already forgot yours. What's with the attitude? How about a cup of coffee or hot water? Hot water, seriously? Is that a thing? I'm just trying to warm you up. Where you going? I got things to do. I'll see you around. How much is this? This is 50 cents. Would you take 43 cents? Uh no? All right. Cool. Excuse me. Can I ask you something? Shoot. What do you think about the name Mr. Extraordinary, like a comic book hero? Sounds badass man. What's the background story? Mr. Extraordinary he's like this ordinary human being with extraordinary powers. He uses the gift of words, and he can write 'em on a sheet of paper. He extracts them off the page, and he uses booming voice to inflict his victims. That sounds cool, man. I would read that. It's a work in progress, but I think I'm, I'm almost there. I like the drawing. You're doing, it sounds like you're tearing it up man. Seriously? I would really like to see the finished product. - Taiye. - Taiye? Edward. Nice to meet you. All right now, be careful. Hey Pops, do you have any more books to read? What you think this is, a library? What you got there? Oh, more of that fantasy mess, Henry Potter. You want to read about a real hero? Read about Willie Mays. Who? Willie Mays! He's one of the greatest baseball players that ever lived. - Thanks. - You welcome. Now what are you reading? Did you know that Superman can burn down buildings with his eyes? Really? How's Mr. Extraordinary gonna beat that? Oh he will. He is gonna have all sorts of cool powers. I just haven't figured them out yet. Okay, good luck with that. The mailbox is full. I cannot accept any messages at this time. Goodbye. Your flashlight. Oh shit, thank you. I just bought new batteries. You saved me money. Can I get one? You serious? Yeah, I want to be. Thanks. So what's your deal, are you homeless? What's your deal, you hooking or something? Oh okay. I guess I deserved that. You ever heard the saying just a bottle, not the contents? You think someone like me would go out with someone like you? I mean you're cute, but you live in a PT Cruiser. Well I mean, cute is a start. So Taiye. Yes hold on, one hot water for you. Thank you. One for me. Cheers. What's the origin of Taiye? I absolutely do not know. I don't know, my pops gave it to me when I was a kid. - Really? - Really. Okay. So what about you? Well I love kids, so I want to own my own daycare center one day. That's cool. Yeah, so what's your next move? First things first is get off these streets. Ha, hot water cheers to that. Why are you shaking your head at us, huh? You're the one who needs to get your shit together. Fuck this comic bookstore you're always talking about. Find something more realistic. I'm supposed to listen to you? You have as much credibility as a toothless dentist. What's that mean? It means you've been out here 12 years. And you shot one bad short film. It was pretty unwatchable. Fuck you! It was an exploration, a visual exploration of feelings. Terrence Malick would have loved it. Just because your dreams flopped don't mean you have to crush mine. Don't mind him, Tai. You know how he gets. What happens to a dream deferred? Does it dry up like a raisin in the sun? Langston Hughes. I'm surprised an old drunk like yourself knows that. Hey Tai, wait up. Tai, I, we need a really big favor from you. What is it? Well. This is wrong on so many levels. I promise we only need to stay at your place for one week. The shelters are always full by the time we get there, and this cold snap is killing us. Shakes and I promise we'll have a place by Friday. Two days tops. Thanks Tai, good man. I'm only doing this because of you. Okay. Hey where you going? I can't sleep with that loud ass snoring in the back. I figure I'll go for a walk. Hopefully it'll make me tired. I know that it was you who drank my booze because you are a liar and a degenerate! I ain't steal nothing, I buy my own! I wouldn't drink after you even if my life depended on it! You're a liar, because I found my bottle empty, next to you! So I know that you are the one who evaporated it. Now you try to tell me that it was drunk by what, some hooch fairy? I told you I didn't do it! - Hey hey hey. - You want to dance? Let's dance, sucker! I've robbed men twice your size, and just as ugly! How dare you? I was a child model! Chill chill, hey hey Miles! I need backup. You just try to go ahead, because I am Mr. Extraordinary, me! 'Cause you are nothing but a homeless piece of shit! You're homeless too, asshole! I am a director. Well it'll be wise for you to say cut! Hey enough, enough enough guys! Enough, enough, enough enough. Go that way, go that way. Take your ass that way. Wait you wait! Wait 'til you go to sleep! Run, run Nancy boy! Run Nancy, run Nancy! Chill chill Shakes. Chill. Do you think Aquaman fucks the fish, or the fish fuck Aquaman? Uh I think that's super dumb. No I mean because he clearly fucks dolphins. Taiye? I knew I could find you here. Jordan, wow. Good to see you man, where you been? No one's heard from you in so long. No one wanted to. I thought you'd be excited to see your brother. Foster brother. Oh, so family means nothing to you now huh? That's because I don't have one. When are you gonna stop letting the past haunt you man? Where you working these days? Oh I'm self-employed. How's that working out? The benefits are unreal! You should come into my office, let me take you to lunch. Who are you again? You show up out the blue, out of nowhere, and you expect me to open my arms up with an embrace and bow down and have a big old family reunion? Sorry bro, I don't need your charity. Okay, God bless then, bro. Since when did you start going to church? I don't. I go to the bank. You're a talent agent? I'll be in touch. Here we are again. Who's counting? I just want to apologize how things went down last time. How's work? Promising. They say I'll take over the company one day. I think you'll make a perfect partner. Thank you. How are things in your world? The streets are the streets. If you'll throw a dog a bone or something... Taiye, you know I can't do that, and my father wouldn't approve of this relationship anyway. I'm sorry. Remember Jordan? Your foster brother? Yeah, what's he been up to? Ah, serendipity. If only I was an actor. Who says you can't be one now? These are my dreams. Your dreams only like you when you're sleeping. What do you mean? I think you know what I mean. Little vodka spritzer never hurt no one. So how do you like my place? Not bad, not bad at all. But I thought we were meeting at your office? Office, who needs an office? Plus, this is a much more intimate setting, anyway. You said you had some business for me. Yeah I'm glad you called. I could really use you right now. I think it may be the other way around. Look buddy, you want to play the part, you need to look it. Okay. Well what... Hold that thought. $2,500 Prada suit. Put it on. I never really wore a suit before. Welcome to my world, bro. Here's a little cherry on top. The key to my extra sports car. Let's go put this thing on you. Hey, got the good stuff? Yeah. All right. Oh sweet. Get it and go man. Oh man. You're doing the lord's work. Later man. Oh my god what happened? Some college fucks threw change at me at the fucking main stage. And what'd you do afterwards? I mean money's money girl, right? Yeah. Oh fuck. Do you want some aspirin? Do you have anything stronger than that? You know I do. Thank god. Damn it. Thank god, thanks. Oh shots too? Oh girl, I love you. Love you too. Cheers. Oh god I needed that. You know that Walter's gonna come for you. Yeah I know. What are you gonna do? I guess I'm gonna have to hit him in the balls a little harder next time. You're trouble. Oh my gosh girl, I love you but I need to go make that money. Okay. And I'm getting coin thrown at me, so all right. All right. Fuck my life. Oh gosh it was a madhouse today. Oh really? Yes, I'm glad we're sitting down finally. A little quiet time. I'll be right back with dinner. Here you are. Don't you feel like you're just taking up space? Excuse me? I don't think I understand what you mean. Just existing, living lavishly while half the world is dying. Doesn't that bother you? It should bother them more than me. Haven't they been given the freedom of choice? Choice, no. I think homelessness, chaos, and disease don't leave much freedom for choice. Then do something about it then, Jen. Don't place the pain of the world on my shoulders because of what I've earned, and don't think for one minute that some halfhearted guilt trip is gonna change the fundamental foundation of this planet, because it won't. And for the record, every morning I get up to you and I've proven time and time again that I'm in this for more than the money. Evidently you don't feel the same. Evidently not. And it's like burgundy. It's kind of like Tristan's but... Tristan's a lawyer. Oh there he is, my big cash cow. More like a jackass. See you found someone taller and more handsome, I see. Asher, meet my brother Taiye. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet ya. Taiye can I talk to you please? How fucking easy was that? The fuck bro? Dude, it's a casual thing. Think of it like a business investment. The more I do, the more money we make! This ain't the kind of business I had in mind. You know what? Take your damn cash. Taiye! I want nothing to do with you, this overpriced ass suit... What are you doing? Stay the fuck away from me, man. Come on man, you never even asked what was in the bags. I shouldn't have to! Taiye don't mess this up. You really changed, man. I'm keeping this money. You almost got me busted. You better watch your back, I run this town! Fuck you. Ain't got shit today. I know, I don't know how you do it walking around with all those bottles? I mean Jesus. Ah. Well, look who's decided to join us. Mr. Extraordinary. I'm not in the mood. Aw, that time of month? Suck it. Oh you couldn't pay me to. Why are you so chipper? Me? I'm still jonesing off those coffee packets you gave me. Not bad huh? No booze, not much of a choice. Caffeine is a drug too. You're telling me, wowza. I spent the entire night walking around Hollywood. Couldn't find one brother with a joint. Ain't that some bullshit? Maybe it's a sign. A sign? Oh look who's getting all philosophical with me. Oh don't be doing that. I am old enough to be your father. Miles, Miles, you hear this boy? No! All I hear is you. Those are crazy man, those guys are just off their rocker man. Get off my branch. Get your ass up off my tree, get off my tree! You are such a petty motherfucker, I tell ya. - Jesus, I'm going. - Walking! What's that for? You and Miles can get something to eat. Booze, buzz, whatever I don't care. Here. Just don't ask me for nothing later. Thanks Tai. What, come again? You heard me. Hey hey hey. What's up? I don't never see you no more. Nah I been busy working. So can I come see you? Yeah you can come. You know where I'm at right? I know where you at. Then come through. Doll, what's up? What's up? Nigga don't you see us talking? Yeah nigga. Cat got this nigga tongue. You want a dollar nigga, what? What's up? Hey where the fuck you think you're going? Come here. You cats gonna be another stereotype man? What? Oh Martin Luther King ass nigga. Hey who do you think you are, Malcolm X nigga? You brothers need the change, get the fuck outta here nigga, for real. Hey, we ain't done talking to your girl. So you can leave little homie. We done with your stupid ass, and get a motherfucking haircut nigga, goddamn. Go. We wasn't done talking to her. Take that boy, that's yours. Bye. - Here. - Bye. - Fuck on outta here. - Hurry up nigga. Get back in your mama's car, before we shoot that bitch up. Scared of us? Aren't you gonna have a glass of wine with me? Oh no babe, I've got an early morning. I've got Sunday clients to meet. I've got to be out of here by five. You go ahead. Ah ah ah ah ah, no flipping, no flipping. You'll fall and break your neck. - No! - No! I said no flipping. You never let us have any fun. I hate this house. I hate this house too, Pops! Hey! You ought to be thankful. - Hungry? - Starving. I tried to call you last night but... I know, I'm sorry I didn't call you back. You sure know how to smooth over ruffled feathers. Don't speak too soon. Have you got some bad news after the night I had? That's the last thing I want to hear. That all depends on your perspective. Okay, let me have it. I'm... I'm married. I'm so sorry. The trees, the leaves, the wind. They've been here for so long. They let me know that I belong. The nature is so powerful, it holds me from within. I cannot help, I must give in. Hey man. You okay? I was just reciting some poetry over there. Are you into that? Looks like you could use some. Are you into poetry man? You look like you could use poetry in your life. Poetry is innately in all of us. It's an art form, where one could express themselves and their life experiences. The good, the bad, and the ugly. You can be random and strange, and you can write the weirdest, most deepest feelings from within. Trust me, you don't want to express the way I'm feeling. Come on. We've all had tragic and magic moments and feelings that we can't explain. But poetry, poetry allows the waves of life to manifest through the spoken word. Don't let life bring you down. Articulate, and you will see how positive your life becomes. Here. Come to the poetry slam. What is this? Send your headshot or picture to that email. We can't wait to see what you got. Doll! Doll! Dang, thank god this place has showers. When you gonna get an apartment? Man, way these assholes tip it's gonna take at least three months. - Three months? - Mhmm. Well what happened with that guy that you were, that homeless guy you were dating? Man, he's still living in a PT Cruiser. Oh sweetie, I'm only 20 years older than you. Mama's gotta find a new way to make some money, so anyways girl, gonna go get my ass out there. All right, break a leg. I wrote this back in the day under the golden corners on a Sunday. A girl flit flutters wide, splutters obscenities checking my pockets for gold. My suicide dies crossed lines within the passage of time and yet still I walk, still I talk, still I breathe, and it does seem a trifle slow blow to blow. Where's the golden joke I was promised? The eternal road to laughter? I met a girl she seemed so nice, so still, but she talks more frills like it's a game, like it's all about a name. I think friends is the word she used, but now abuse. I think that fits her better. Stolen away stolen tongues using dreams to escape our hate. Search an easier... Well, you're a sight for sore eyes brother. All right how you doing man? Good to see you man. All right, I got a little something for you here. Oh you know I like that. Oh yeah. Damn, what's up with all these kids, Leo? Oh man, the foster plan is the plan indeed, brother. I see! Now the big ones are 400 each, and the little ones 350 each. So what that one hitting on for right there? 350. Can I get that one? I'm a little short on taxes this year. No way man, I don't sell 'em I just watch 'em. The government's paying me to watch 'em. Okay I got plenty of room at the house. I can watch 'em too. No we ain't in no pedophiles yet. I just wanna make some money you know? Whoa whoa slow your roll, baby. Pedophilia, what what? What you talking about taking my babies? I'm trying to eat. Who's that boy over there that come up in here with you? Oh is that, oh. Mhmm. Now go on ahead, what was you saying? Well, you come over here taking my womens. I don't know what to say. Where my pistol at? What you gonna get your pistol for? You ain't gonna do nothing but get beat with it. You know we don't shoot and beat each other. Not at all, 'cause if I kill ya then no one would talk to you. The same sense of humor, thank you. That's right, go and get you some of that. Yeah that's some good stuff. I thought about you when I bought it today. - I appreciate that. - Absolutely. You thirsty hon? Good looking out. I didn't drop it. I'm fast when it comes to catching my whiskey. Nah 'cause if you'd have dropped it, then I would have really used that pistol. Excuse me sir, you can't post that here. Oh shit, she's alive. Wow, you look good. Thank you! I guess that's what 30 days of clean living does. - Wow amazing, amazing. - Thank you. - I'm proud. - What about you? Check this out. I took these today. Nice, lookin' good! Thanks, thanks. I posted these in about 10 different blocks. Not expecting a ton of people, but if one or two show up, I'll be happy. What's the matter? Nothin', it's just funny. Sometimes the things we don't say mean the most. Let me show you something. What's this? Mr. Extraordinary. I found his angle, like his thing. He's a poet by day and he's a crime fighter by night. Like he uses his words to invoke change, to inspire people. To help them find they purpose. To be great. What? You don't like it do you? No! It's extraordinary. Come on, come help me hang up some of these. Get a couple. You gonna have to use your thumb though. Give me my own. Hey! You, fancy lady. Take a flyer. A flyer, there's a show later. - It's a show. - Okay. All right, keep it moving. You, one leg effervescence, you. Fancy lady, take a flyer. There's a show, it's free. Hey you toddlers, you, come on! - No thank you. - Olsen twins, Rico Suave, take a flyer! Five words are what I long to hear. Five words have never been held so dear. Five words are all it takes and those same five words will deliver me from the deceitful snake, but before those five words are said I must say five words myself. Forgive me, forgive me, forgive me of my sins are my five words, and saying these five words makes me eligible to receive his grace, and by grace ye are saved. By grace ye are saved. Yeah! What's going on Jordan? How you doing baby? Ooh I know you. What you got for me? - I got some new stuff. - Yeah? Everybody's likin' it man. Feels a little light here, you sure? What, pick it up again. It's good stuff man. - 100% proven. - I'll see it. - This one? - He's got jokes. Come and get it. What you got, you gonna give me, get my gay mafia on ya. Hey man when are you gonna call me in for a part? You know what, I think we got a casting coming up for some Fox thing. I'm telling you, I'm great man. I could do anything. Yeah I'll let you know. - All right. - All right man. - See you later. - Have fun, be safe. Oh, let me see your hand. A gift from me to you. Don't spend that in more than one place. Aw, I'll try not to. You want to go dancing? Right now? Right now. All right. Come on. Fully expose me, thank you. Yeah. - So sweet. - Mhmm. Oh that was fun. Hold on I got something here. Aw, thank you. Yeah. You had fun right? I did, I had a great time. But you told me you could dance. Hater! No, I'm not a hater I'm just... You don't like those moves? - Mm mm, gettin'... - No. Please never ever show me those moves. So, should I walk you home? About that. Yeah, about that. Let me make it up to you. Wakey wakey my friend. How long you been up? About an hour. Oh don't worry, I turned the flashlight off. I started reading when the sun came up. Didn't know you had an interest in comic books. No neither did I. Yeah well, you just keep reading those. I'm sure it will lead us to a place to live. Oh we have a place to live. Yeah right, what Taiye's car? No, the world. Well, it is my playground. Exactly. Don't limit yourself. Whoever said you had to put a price tag on something that we didn't own to begin with? The Joneses. Fuck the Joneses. Hey. Hey, get up. So, fellas. Will I be seeing you guys tonight? Wouldn't miss it for the world. All right. What's wrong? It's my brother. Brother? I didn't know you had a brother. Yeah, neither did I. Keep flyering. I'll be right back in about an hour. I want to go with you. It's a family matter. Hey. Where's Jordan? He's gone. What do you mean gone? It's your fault. What happened? If you would've never bought the coke, he would still fucking be here. What part of that don't you understand? I was picking it up. I was trying to help him. You couldn't have thought what you were doing was on the up and up. He's a fucking agent. I thought I was doing something good. He's my brother for god's sake. Foster brother, right? I hadn't seen him in years. It never crossed my mind. See that's the problem, where have you been? Had you been here, you'd fucking know. You were right there doing it with him. So? You know, he said that I would be the death of him. Everything I want in the world, and I still couldn't get that right. It's not your fault. You know all this shit's fake. It's all a facade. Yo Jordan lost his job at the agency like two years ago and we've just been doing what we can to keep up this Hollywood lifestyle. Funeral is on Monday in Pasadena. Thought you should know. I really like his belt. Thanks. I'm actually almost finished with it. Really? Wow that took you a long time. Taiye, what'd I tell you about that comic book monkey junk? I just finished, what no! Just draw another one. Look it's perfectly fine, see? Look. Like it? Yeah, thanks. Come on, it's perfectly fine. He's just a mean, grumpy old man. Too much to drink. It's gonna be fine. I hate it. It's all ripped. I think it looks nice. Still has the cool belt. Beautiful day isn't it? Welcome to Los Angeles. I'm not sure it'd be quite as beautiful if you weren't here. LA is filled with beautiful women. Where you headed? None of your business. Come on, Doll. Get in. I don't think so. Why don't you keep driving? You've got eyes on you. Poetry, poetry today! Fresh poetry! Poetry today. - All right I'll check it out. - See poetry. I'll check it out, thanks. Poetry, anybody else? Come come come, come on. Poetry! Walter, I found her. Yeah. Hi everybody! Thank you for coming in today to Poetry in the Park. We have a newbie today. He's extremely talented, a lot of heart and a lot to say, so I want to give a warm welcome to Taiye Daniels! Thank you thank you, I'm a bit nervous. My first time doing this. I see a couple familiar faces out here. Shakes, Miles. Here we go. All I have is a pen, a pad, and a voice. We're left with many options, but ultimately to make the right choice. Fear is a factor that hinders us in life. Life is about choices. It's about weighing out the differences. - No! - Come on Doll. - Come on! - Get off me! - Come on. - Don't worry Doll, relax! Let me go! - Over here, calm down. - Fuck you Walter! Relax, up against it, come on. When you feel inadequate, when you feel weary, when you feel afraid, to find out which one was the right one, the jack or the spade. - Get off of me! - Give me that! The choices in life, the girlfriend or the wife? The brother from another mother, the one who made the bad choices. Then you start to realize that you are the people's choices. I don't know which one is wrong and which one is right, but I know I have to make a choice, because all I have is a pen, a paper, and a voice. Sometimes I feel like quitting, but that's the easy option. I'm the type of man that make 1,000 fails just to have one win. What's wrong? Oh what? He did what? Hey. All right, all right say no more. And to start over and start over and start over and then I win again. I realize all I have is a pen, a paper, and a voice. - Yeah Tai! - Yeah. Thank you. It's good to see you. You came a long way since where we were right? Did you see this coming? No. A mile away. Where did it all come from? From within. Yo you Walter? The fuck wants to know? You Walter? Brother you inspire me. Work with it. You're doing good. Wow. Thank you. Thank you. So, Taiye. Who's it going to be tonight? The lawyer, or the stripper? I feel like Jennifer she's my coffee, and Doll she's my cabbage. What? What's coffee and cabbage? What the fuck is that? Well see like Papa Leo used to say, coffee is your stimulus. Dabble here and there is all you need, but it's so addictive. But cabbage? That's your necessity, it's your everything. Your water, your air, your breath. Oh really? Well they both give me the shits. Oh Taiye let's get a drink. You know that was a good one. Hey guys! Hey can I sleep in the car tonight? No you're dead. Wait a minute. - What are you doing? - Haven't you had enough? Come on. I know when I've had enough, I'm fine. Come on. You let go of the bottle. This is the second bottle. I'm a grown woman! You stop it. Wait. I'm a grown woman with needs. Right. And this is gonna fulfill your needs? All you need to do is initialize section 13, 15, and sign it and you're good to go my man. Ah man, feel like a dream come true. You said right here and right here? Yeah yeah, section 16 too. Okay. Did I tell you that I would do it if it came down to it? I told you when time was gonna be shining I was gonna get it through for ya. You came through, so initial right here? Yeah right there and section six please. - Okay. - Yeah. And sign? Sign right at the bottom, yeah yeah. Now I want to say something. The reason I'm doing this man is because I believe in you. I don't do this for anybody. I told you when I first met you, I said listen, one day I'm gonna pay it back because the way that you and the boys brought me in, I'm not one to judge anybody, and I believe that you're gonna take this comic book store to the next level. The corporate arena's gonna take you far, man. Andy, you're really a man of your word man. Well listen, I want an autographed version of Mr. Extraordinary when you hit it big, all right? You get two. All right, give me about like Tuesday to push this through. Yeah you can keep the pen. I got about 65 of 'em in my office. - Bigshot. - Yeah right. Mr. Andy himself. Not even, not even. Good luck man. All right, take care. All right buddy. Subtitles by explosiveskull
