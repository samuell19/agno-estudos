Where am I? What do you mean? In the car. I left because it's always the same. You can't take our life? It's been 25 years of... OK, take some breathing space. Go to your daughter's. I can't say it all again. I'm hanging up because I'm at the factory. Christine, what are you doing here? Can't you tell? You're a receptionist now? Mr Maurey, you think this amuses me? No one wants the job. It's way out of town. - So should we move? - It'd suit me. By the way, Mr Rolland wants to see you... - Your daughter! - Hello. Hello. - Isn't Rolland here? - Out back... Thank you. Rolland, what's going on? You wanted a word? - The internet's rocking. - Rumours. Speculating on our downfall. Unless we take an ally... Strategy is my bag. X27 is our best project. I don't need Yank money to launch it. Bloody Rolland! Listen to him! "Yanks". He sounds so seventies. Yes. What's up with mum? Ah, Marianne. Has she blown a fuse? Why? She wants to reflect in my flat. - What does that mean? - She wants to reflect. Why my place? I won the jackpot! What's more, you talk without looking at me. I hate you. Bye! Wait. Marianne! Marianne! Hello? I'm not talking to the Americans. Who? Charles? I'll take it. Arseholes with their dollars. I was right. X27 is years of work. I won't flog it off. Who's this? I'll call you back. Let me get in! - What happened to you? - Drive. My husband left me there. - A lovers' tiff? - He's violent. He's always... This time it was my eye. Oh! Where are you going? To a friend's. You think he can put me up? Just for tonight. - Charles works freelance. - At home? Don't worry. He lives alone. He has room. But I'll have to talk to him first. Stay there. You'd help anyone. But I have to put her up? Come on, it's fine. - Hot enough? - Yes. Herb tea won't help your eye. A compress? No, thanks. I'll be fine. Your friend's waiting. Pretend I'm not here. So, kid? Her guy's a vandal! Luckily, I had herbal tea. Do I give her a joint? Don't joke. Let me look. What you're going to see is top secret. You're sure that the girl... I have trouble understanding your tables, never mind her! You don't know. Maybe she's a... Have you seen her? Yes... Butter wouldn't melt. But still... Isn't that better? Oh, shit. Idiot! I've been looking a month, and in 5 seconds... You've humiliated me for 30 years. How much do I owe? - 10% of receipts? - Not much. - Do I know your backers? - American Disk Enterprise. As if by chance. Chance doesn't come into it. You know why they hire me? Because I bail you out. They don't care what I'm developing. They're interested in one thing: X27. I have to talk you into selling to them. They can whistle. I'm 10 years ahead. If you sell, they'd save all that time. You know why they want it? Because Modern Soft Company are doing the same research. They're at war and we're in the middle... Not what we dreamt of 20 years ago. Yes. Globalisation, old chum. Let's stop complaining like old farts. What will the girl think? - We're old fools. - Speak for yourself. I found a record we used to dance to. Back when you used to look at me with desire in your eyes. But that was before time took its toll... Blah-blah-blah... What a pain you were with your syrupy ballads! I was into Brassens... She didn't say thank you? The bitch! There's a Florence asking for you. Don't know her. You see her. She's here. Did you give her my address? I hope you settle things with your husband. Maybe if I found some work. We've just moved here. - The switchboard. - Pardon? The switchboard. The job's free because of maternity leave. Fancy that? Yes. If he'd been to business school, he's use this synergy. It'd boost our projects. Give him the study we did on external capital. He'll never read it. He hates change. He swears by third-worldism, withdrawal and anti-Americanism. And he doesn't want X27 presented at the Salon de Paris. Shame! It'd be a triumph. He could sell his patent to Zanzibar! Even with diplomas, a fool is still a fool. Who? Why the glasses? That's enough! Her husband's a brute. Now she has a job, he could hit her elsewhere. What a jerk! You're Maurey. Listen good. My wife doesn't need your job. I've enough money. Don't lay a finger on her. For the list of customers, press here... Well? I'm struggling with the computer. You'll get used to it. Just a matter of time. - Does your husband ride a motorbike? - Yes. He just attacked me. No! He said you didn't need to work. He's mad. This is a chance for us. Have him come for a chat. And tell him I can't stand threats. Let's get back to work. OK? So... Start again. Financing development by flotation? Is that all you can suggest? No, I'm not in a position to do that. Yes, I'll think about it. I asked you for grants. Don't be surprised if youngsters flee to the States. Right. You'll call me. I didn't want to disturb you. Thank you for the job but I can't stay. My husband's unpredictable. He's likely to... Wait. Don't worry about me. I can defend myself. Florence, we need you in this job. You get on with Christine? Yes! She's like a mother. Fine. Ask her for the bumph for Paris. Pardon? There's a fair in Paris. We'll take you. Put some distance between you and him. There's a travel bonus too. When he sees how much you make, he'll reconsider. - I don't know what to say. - Say nothing. Just smile. Back to work. Hello. Can I help you? ...may interest you. You can talk to... I can't talk about the X27 project. I'm sorry. But leave your details. We'll call you. Everything OK, Florence? Yes, fine. 7 o'clock. That's right, sir. Your attention, please. On this final day, we remind you the fair is closing in 5 minutes. A toast to the sales team, who did a remarkable job. To our future! Cheers! - Cheers. - Rolland? - Is the champagne off? - No. I don't want to spoil the party but we could have made some big deals! You made a mistake. X27 will be a massacre. Go to bed, Rolland. You're tired. I don't like to sleep alone. Are you free? Rolland, apologise. It's nothing. He's tired. Apologise, Rolland! I'm sorry. No harassment. This isn't America. I'm ashamed. I asked to split the bill. You do that with friends. No. You're my boss. And that wine... Did I drink a lot? I didn't notice. How well-mannered you are! But I've never drunk a better wine. Was I being silly? No. You talked about you. So I know a bit... Oh? What did I say? Oh! Your husband... My husband? Here, look... I love playing tourists. Isn't that the best view in the world? I've never been here. I believe you. My life in Paris was no picnic. I'm sorry I criticised my husband. No. You said he was unlucky. The local star who fails in Paris, it happens every day. It's a tough industry. I know. It's no reason for beating you and making your life hell. - Think of yourself now. - I haven't for a long time. You can't stay on the switchboard. I need another assistant. Why do you want to help me? It just happens to be you. Oh no. No tears, now. I'm sorry, but... this is the first time I've had any luck. I can't go back like this. My feet are dirty. I've got a hanky. It tickles. - Have you brought your wife here? - Long ago. Your feet are cold. I'll warm them up. Feel better? Yes. Have you cheated on her? What about you? I shouldn't have asked. Give me your other foot. I've never cheated on my wife. She's exceptional. You still love her? - Feel better? - Yes. Thank you. Can I kiss you to thank you? Sorry. Sorry, I apologise. You're too well-mannered. No. I'm taking advantage. I never cheated on my wife. Let's get back. Or tongues will wag. - But you're going to divorce. - But I haven't yet! Hello, Mr Maurey. You're expected. Marianne isn't here, of course. Can I kiss you? Thank you. Shall we bury the hatchet? No, we're just here to talk. Then let's talk. We'll wait for Marianne. Can I kiss you? You can do anything. A rather chilly atmosphere. You're not heading for divorce? I say that because it's so common nowadays. You're right. Very common. - What are we after, Flo? - Flo? Hang on, I'm Caro. Maybe he's already met someone. I thought we were going to talk about our future. I'm still your daughter. We made zero progress tonight. We'll have to sort things out. Look out! - What? - The bike! Calm down, I saw the bike. Wow! You're a bit tense right now. Well, Mum, are you going home or...? Sorry. Don't worry, I'll send her back soon. Florence? - What are you doing here? - Just hanging out to calm me down. I moved into a hotel last night. What's happened? My husband won't let me go to night classes. It drove him mad. So I left. - You did the right thing. - I doubt it. He might catch me at work. He wouldn't dare. I'll go back to my hotel. Thank you. Goodnight. Wait! I'll drive you there. Whereabouts is it? That's your hotel? It's a brothel. There. It's my daughter's room. She slept here before she got her own flat. Don't tell me you like the same music. - You know these singers? - A bit. I'd never dare sleep here. You're so scared that... We'll put it down to charity. Goodnight. Thank you. American Disk Enterprise offered me double! Modern Soft or American Disk, it's the same. It means I'm not selling to either of them. Fuck off! Did I wake you? - No. - They're American, it's the best time to call. Go back to bed, I won't make any more noise. The noise doesn't bother me. In fact, I don't know how to put this... I'm starving hungry. Will an omelette do? It's lovely here. My wife did all that. She has taste. What are you doing to win her back? Listening to Bachelet. No. I'm joking. - I know. - Oh. Tell me. You carry on loving her. That's the only thing to do. Thanks for the omelette. It was good. I'm off to bed. Goodnight. Goodnight. My mum liked this singer a lot. How does the alarm work? You press the black button. It's best if... I come. You're a perfect man. You're faithful, you can make alarms work... Go on, make fun! There. 7.30. It wasn't that hard. What can I do for you? Do you tuck your daughter in? No. Her mother did. I'd tell her a story. Right. Goodnight. Why 7.30? It's Sunday tomorrow. I can't sleep. I was wondering... What kind of stories did you tell? Look, Florence. I don't remember. The story of a guy who's lost because his wife leaves him? That's it. I'd tell her that kind of story. It's a shame. Because that guy moves me. Goodnight, then. - What? - I felt something. There are mice. Mice? Maybe they're bats? My daughter used to invent monsters to avoid sleeping. - You're not tired? - No. There's everything here for the insomniac. If you don't like books, there are cassettes. - I'm sorry. - Don't be. This is a Bergman. My favourite. You've nothing American? Yes, my daughter's cartoons. Go on, make fun. Give me the Bergman. The VCR works... Well, it's simpler than the alarm. Wait. There. - You press here. - Thank you. I'll be off. I know this film. It's been on television. I didn't sleep for a week afterwards. What, Cries and Whispers? It's a masterpiece. It won't give you nightmares. No but it makes you cry. You're sensitive. Otherwise I've Bambi, Dumbo... Forget it. I can see I'm boring you. Your friend Charles was much nicer. What's nicer about him? He did everything to make me feel at home, whereas you... I see. So what should I do? I don't know... Take me in your arms? Fuck! What did he do? I'll never do it. What are you doing? I'll look for a hotel. But it's Sunday. Hotels are open on Sundays. They're beautiful. Try them, if you like one. Your wife's dresses? Never. I feel like a kid after his first night. I don't believe you. You make love well. - Rubbish! I was trembling. - Oh? I didn't notice. I'll make you some coffee and have croissants delivered. And pains au chocolat? Penny for your thoughts. Have you ever looked at yourself? - What's wrong? - Living with that loser... I didn't choose anything. It was chance. You're smart. Have you no ambition? - You know where I'm from? - Yes. But you've every chance. Oh yeah? Being a hooker, like my friends? Any more questions? You've reached François and Caroline. Leave us a message and we'll get back to you. Hello, François? Are you there? It's Charles. I must talk to you. It's very urgent. It's lovely. But I know this. Oh? So you did listen to music at home. Not really. I just heard it. Lucky you're here. I listen to nothing, apart from Bachelet. Leave a message we'll get back to you. Mr Maurey, you still haven't replied to our latest proposals. We await your call impatiently. It's Sunday! And on Sunday... "And on Sunday"... Shit! How did he do it? Fuck. I've no time. Florence? What are you doing here? Writing to you. - Read it when I've gone. - Where to? To work. Receptionists should arrive first. What have you written? "I must go back to my husband." Not in front of me. It's embarrassing. What do you want? You miss your biker? He's a singer and he's my husband. Look... It was good for us both. I don't want it to go on. It'll be a nice memory. Let's not spoil it. - With him, you'll spoil things. - He's my husband! "My husband"! What's this? The cops? - What's happened? - Florence's husband was waiting. He jumped on her. He hit me. Look at my eye! You have to fire her. Here he is. We'll find them. - Where's Flo? - He took her. Shit! Report this, for the insurance. It's a personal matter. I'm not reporting it. - Personal? He beat me up. - It'll shake your ideas up. - Which? - The stupid ones. Come on, don't get upset. I'm calm. But I don't want the police. - What's got into him? - How should I know! Right. We don't belong here. What about my eye? Come to the station if you want. Goodbye all! Get me Flo's number. Florence, I mean. I have to talk to her. - Aren't there other priorities? - What? I don't know... The company's future, maybe. I found traces on my computer that don't match. Watch your things. Are you hanging around at night? What for? And get off my back! Find me something for my eye instead. Anyone home? Oh, it's you. Yes, it's me. You seem disappointed. I could smell someone's perfume. The cleaning woman? Oh yes? Then she's changed perfumes. Anyway, you do as you wish now. I'm not jealous. You're free. To do stupid things. Why aren't you at work? - Drinking? - Yes. Well... I don't like seeing you unhappy! You know why I'm going. Oh, yes! When it's no fun any more... I don't know how to say it, but... stay. I'll play Bachelet all day long... You've someone else. You don't know what to do. Right. There's someone else and I don't know what to do. And there's something else missing: sensuality. - I had that! But you needed to get it up now and then! There's been a ruckus. A madman arrived. I don't care about your problems. Tell me where you are with X27. I drew a blank. What does "draw a blank" mean? I need more time. I have all the programmes but not all the codes. Maurey is too smart. Carry on with the psychology. Be clever. Rolland? Can you be clever? Doesn't it show? Oh, it's you. Don't jump for joy! Can I stay anyway? I came for a bag that Mum left. It's no better between you. What's this? Are you mental? What have you got in the fridge? A friend gave me a recipe. You can be my guinea pig. Hello? Ah, Christine. Yes. I drank half a bottle of whisky but I'm not even drunk! Rolland? He'll calm down. Offer him a drink. Look, Christine... I'll see you tomorrow. Look, Christine... Oh, Florence. Where are you now? Dad? Dad! What's Flaubert doing in this shithole? Good God! Leave me alone! Are you scared, bitch? - See that car? - He's coming at us. - Looking for trouble? - Leave her alone. Are you Zorro? - I've plenty of money. - Clown! Show us the dough. There. It's yours. We want the car. I've lots of cash. - Do I throw it away? - Wait. No. Now clear off. Bastard! I've no courage but I do have money. He locked me in and left. I broke the window and shouted. A caretaker let me out. Then I... I called you and those jerks showed up. It's just a nightmare. One more nightmare. Let's stay in the dark. He doesn't know this address. I'd rather. Do you want a drink? I'll take a shower. Go on, don't worry. - Oh, it's you. - Yes it is. - What do you want? - What? I called, sent you an email... So what? What do you mean? Can't I come in? No. I'm with someone. - There's a...? - I'll tell you later. What is it? American Disk, X27... What are you doing? Nothing. I'm letting them stew. Think. They're stronger than us. - How much did they pay you? - Right! Just be careful. - Stop being my big brother. - OK, manage on your own. It was Charles. Idiot. You scared me. - I've been here ages. - Voyeur. Yes. And I reckon I'm lucky. It's me who's lucky. I feel like nothing existed before you. Don't say that to please me. I'm hungry. Don't move, I'll see to everything. What the... How did you get in? Through the door. - What do you want? - My wife. Go on. We'll see if she goes with you. I had it in my bag in case he came back. I'll call the police. - Put it down. - I must call the cops. - Don't, I said. - I'm calling the police. - I don't want to go to prison. - You won't. Put the gun down. They'll question us. It'll end badly. - It was self-defence. - Oh yeah? What was I doing in your bed, then? Is shooting your mistress's husband self-defence? What will we do with this? - You know where we're going? - Be quiet. We have to cover him. Wait. I can't do this. We can't wait. Someone might come. I cleaned the car. What are you doing? I can't get a cleaning woman to do it! - Calm down. - I am calm! You amaze me! You killed a man! - I saved your life. - I could manage. He'd have buried you and disfigured me. Be quiet. Get washed, get changed. Get a room. Go to work tomorrow. - If anyone asks... - He's away on tour. Good idea. Far away, with a group. - And then? - Then... Yes. Mrs Guégan for you. Hold the line. See you later. - If anyone asks, I'm... - OK, very well. It's all because of his wife. She's gone to their daughter's. Have you seen him? He looks like he killed someone. You know what I'd call him? A wimp. It's French. You'd never see that in the States. Just when he's about to cross the finish line... If we want to save X27, we'd best get out our study. You can continue your conversation. The future of the company concerns me too. What's your new study? - Have the Americans called? - Yes. But he won't answer. The guy's not well. But Florence is much better now her rocker's on tour. How did that loser strike gold like that? Luck! The guy's lucky. You need that in showbiz. What's that? It must be pirates! - The bastards! - Systems accessed. What's this? "What about your friend? "He refuses our proposals. Haven't you talked?" "Have you forgotten our agreement?" What agreement? Blackmail! I'm no Judas. Clear enough? It's me! Smile when you see me, Zorro. It's not Zorro, it's Dickhead. You've thrown stuff out. Hello? Oh, it's you. - My husband's family are looking. - His family? - The guy had a family? - Yes. What did you say? They don't believe you? I'm on my way. Sorry, Marianne, I have to go. Bye. If, one day, you remember you have a daughter... - Is it yours? - Yes. No one will think to look here. In this season there are no tourists. It's a good hideout. There. It's fabulous! Nothing is too good for you. Take a rest. You're on holiday. Sleep with me tonight. Scared of sleeping alone? If Christine doesn't see me... Stay. I won't sleep at all. You can leave in the morning. I need your reassurance. You didn't copy the whole patent, Mr Rolland. We can do nothing with it. Maurey had us work separately. He put the elements together like a puzzle. Each day that passes costs us dearly. Modern Soft may try to double-cross us. Can we still rely on you? Haven't I worked well? You want a complete copy of X27? You'll get it. Keep your promises. We will keep our promises. But first, do your work. Probably, yes. How about 11 o'clock? Here again, Christine? Excuse me. Either the receptionist is late... - Or she's with her husband. - Don't say that! Here. Mr Rolland asked me to give you this. This is what your study shows. You've been paid to undermine morale. Everything you write is a tissue of bullshit. If I sell, you'll be out on the street. X27 is ours too. Where are the fruits of our labour? I'm ambitious. I don't want to end up an IT officer at the town hall. You'll end up a victim of globalisation. Write a piece outlining the new world economy. It'd be more interesting. This is a piece by a student trained to serve multinationals. If any of you isn't happy, you know where the door is. You give me a new zest for life! You never lost it. What if I jacked it all in to look after you? No. It's not enriching. It's passionate! To give you all you never had. That'd take a lot of money. I'll have it, if I sell my patents. No, I was joking. I don't want to be responsible for... What? My early retirement? It wouldn't be that. It'd be a new life. - I'd take you everywhere... - You'd want a child. I hadn't thought of that. For now, you're my child. - You're not my dad. - But I could be. Have you nothing funnier to tell me? Yes, the sun is setting. Ah. The setting sun... Watch. ...makes me nostalgic. If I'd known, I'd have tidied up, Mr... It doesn't matter. We're here because those up there didn't like the "fuck you". As far as François and X27 go, "fuck you" once again. Shame an artist like you feels compelled to "bugger about", as they say in English. I do what I can. We didn't pick the right number with you. What do you gain by not helping us? What I gain? I keep a friend. Will that do you? That feeling is not quantifiable on our machines. Then I'll say it again: fuck you. Hard luck on me. It'll be hard luck on your friend. - The Beatles cut suited you. - More than the army cut. Look, that's with Charles. Doing service overseas in Africa. Great big machines. See the size? That'd fit in your pocket now. We trained lots of kids! Is this your wife? - She's beautiful. - I fell for her. She pushed me to start the firm. Her father was a notable, he helped me. You took bourgeois money? He was paid back handsomely. Your daughter. When she was born, I needed money. - I made alliances. - So you did sell out! I said alliance, not allegiance. You don't lose your ideas. To think that you said you'd sell it all for me. You've never compromised your ideas. Sooner die! How could you change? It's not good to lie. You forget I killed my husband and I'm a prisoner. Sorry, but... far from the world like this, I thought we'd won the war. Don't worry. I'll save you. - What do we do? - What do I do. I sell X27 and 33% of my shares. No. They won't want that. They want 100% and you too. How do you know? Information comes through the switchboard. I heard it at the factory. Right. Let's drop it. - I'll go to bed. - Go on. I need to think. Where are you going? - Weren't you asleep? - No. I listened to you touch me. I thought you'd stay. I have to go to work. Let me go. Let me go. Tough luck. François! I will be your prisoner. Don't do any... - It's the police. - The police? - I called them. - Why? Florence has disappeared. - You're mad. - Maybe her husband abducted her. It's impossible, he's... Hello. I'm François Maurey. My colleague... Inspector Bovary, like Flaubert's "Madame". Your colleague did the right thing. - You reckon? - Yes. The junior staff act as canaries. We've some questions for you. Look, I don't know what to say. I didn't know the woman. It's all... What will you do? We have her name and that of her violent husband. This lady told us. What can you tell us? Nothing. Nothing else. We wanted to help. We shouldn't have bothered. Right, I have work to do. Sorry I didn't call. I'll tell you later. - What about the Americans? - The Yanks? What do you advise? Don't you think it's time you faced facts? - You're right. As ever. - Yes. I'll call back. Don't call again. I won't know what to say. I'm not signing. I don't understand. Where's your fight? 20 years of your life just frittered away? Frittered! Honestly! - Your dad would say that. - Have you thought of him? And his savings that helped you because he liked your ideas? The "rightwing bourgeois" will be spinning in his grave. Why sell? - That firm was your life. - Wasn't I your life? You see. After 20 years we see we were wrong. I was wrong. My life is getting eaten up by Modern Soft or American... Wait. There's a woman behind all this. Will you sign? You decide just like that, on an impulse... because of me? For me. But... No... I feel responsible... I mustn't... Right. Take care. Don't bother, Rolland. It's my partner's agreement for me to sell to your friends. Yes. Don't look sulky. X27 is impregnable! But that's no secret. I could turn you in. Patent theft would get you... But I'll get you. I'm selling you too. They'll appoint you in my place. That's your punishment. I'm abandoning you to the cyberworld. Find me Christine. Christine? Yes, she's over here. I'll call her... OK, sir. - Sorry. - No. Good timing. Listen to what the inspector found out about your friend. The only Florence Dubert born on that day is a florist. As for her husband, nothing. That means Florence and her husband never existed. Look... If she's not from St-Girons, she could be from elsewhere. Of course she is. But where is "elsewhere"? Best we all forget Florence Dubert. Forget? You really are a boss. The staff are cannon fodder. They disappear, it's not your affair. - I didn't say that. - Profitability is the watchword. - Fuck. Marx was right. - Where does Marx come into it? What did Sartre say about Marxism? "Marxism is an impassable horizon." What conclusion do you come to? I'm neither cop nor Marxist. Only you could dig up a Marxist cop. So, sir, what do we do with Florence? Who's Florence? Yes. Oh, it's you. I was outside in the sun. You know a certain Florence Dubert, florist in St-Girons? No? But I'm Florence Dubert. She has your name. Odd coincidence. But it's my name! Mine and my husband's. - The police... - The police? Why the police? Who called them? What business is it of hers? Her business is my business. Who are you, if you're not... Why? It's impossible. You're right. Don't get upset. I can't keep telling you stories, lying... The truth. Who are you? I can't. Not on the phone. I'm coming. Yes. It's me. Tell him to call me back. It's urgent. More than urgent. Yes? I did what we said, but you haven't done what was planned. Right. Just do it. OK? Right. I'll stay here. Is it you? You scared me. Hello, Christine? I'm leaving. I won't be long. The Americans? They can wait a minute now. Flo? Flo! Shit! Untie her. - When I get my money. - What money? - How much do you need? - Loads. - How much is in the bank? - It's all in shares. Don't take the piss. Can't you wait a bit? The Americans are buying me out. - But untie her. - I give the orders. - And I'm the mug. I get it. - What? - The cops. - What cops? They're on your trail. Your couple doesn't exist. Thanks, Florence, or whoever, for showing me passion, danger... - How did you get out of the hole? - I'll explain later. When you've collected. Shall we go? Untie her. I see your game. You see one or two things but you missed an episode. We're going to the bank. Roseline, cash it all up. My shares, everything! I need cash within the hour. How much is that? Is that all? How much? 500 grand. If we sell next week... Don't mess about! I want it all. What else have I got? OK. Sell that too. OK. I'll be there in an hour. - How much is that? - A million. You'll be fine. Where will you take Flo? She'd like the Caribbean. I'm not taking her. Look. I'm the grain of sand that jams the machine. OK? So there's a machine too? So tell me your story, then. You don't want to share the money with your wife. - She is your wife, isn't she? - No. Ah! She's not your wife. I reckon you're wrong to go it alone. - She's a gifted partner. - Yes. A great pro. She winks and it's the 14th of July in your brain. - Oh, you've a brain? - Didn't you notice? You don't notice much. The cops are here. - I'm speeding. - Then slow down. Slow down! It's OK. I'm a notable in the region. I'm slowing. Put your gun away! Highway police. What speed were you driving? Yes. I'm François Maurey. You know, the computer firm... Mr Maurey... We thought we recognised the car. - Is this a friend? - Yes. We race. This time you can go. You've a problem with your tyre. Don't worry. Oh, fuck! Where is he? I don't believe it. Shit! She's gone. Florence! Hello, Roseline? You've sold nothing, I hope. It was a joke. You don't like it? I don't like jokes either. I'll call back. - Good news. - What? We found your friends. I ordered you a cognac. It's always like that, the first time. Then you get used to it. Another. You're brave, identifying bodies. - Weren't they drowned? - The coroner is positive. A bullet to the head for both of them. Right. In my report, I'll say you recognised the guy She was pretty messed up. Did the dress ring a bell? Affirmative. - Anything to add? - There is one thing... I haven't told you. In fact, this girl... really did come from elsewhere. It is with great honour that I agree to take charge of the subsidiary of American Disk Holdings. Thank you. Just a word in closing to our former boss. Dear François, you were worried about our future. Now you're reassured. Our X27 patent is in good hands. - And we owe it to you. - Spare me the smooth talk. The Traitor costume suits you to a T. Taittinger. These Americans know how to live. What was I saying? We'll be kings. François... You made the right choice, picking us above Modern Soft. Why don't you drink with us? Your child will become a large international firm. With what your shares will bring in, you can retire. With Rolland as CEO, a guy who couldn't pirate a patent, you're the ones that'll be retiring. We've put Rolland in temporarily. He'll be overseen by our manager who's coming from the States. So you don't trust youngsters? Youngsters that we train. I don't think I belong here now. I don't know if Rolland will stand you entering without knocking. Stuff Rolland. And I wanted to say that if you start a new firm... - We've talked about this. - I'd like... Please don't cry. No. But it's not for you. Poor Florence. If she'd left her rocker, she might still be with us. Don't think about that. Go and have a drink. As for the future... Thanks for everything, mate. Goodbye, sir. Goodbye. Goodbye, everyone. Hello? I don't understand. Where? You're expected in room 146. The view's as nice as Montmartre. Don't you think? Who are you? A model employee. Go on, laugh! Stay where you are! I'm staying. I just did my job. Your job? I deal with Americans, Norwegians... Please! But when they asked me to nobble someone French, I didn't get it. How could I be exotic to the boss of a small firm? You see. Your employers were right. Your schmaltzy novel... If it's your idea, it's a big hit. - Hitting on you. - Yes. I'm not supposed to hate you? You did your job. Fine acting! But you had an easy customer. I've a right to that. You cost me dearly. Why did you bring me here? Because it's in the contract. - What does that mean? - You'll see. Be patient. You didn't answer me. What are we doing here? I haven't finished my job. Sit down. Wait till the sun rises. Why? Eh? Why? Alive, you're dangerous to them. - So they'll come. - What, to...? They're scared of me? You think your bosses are scared of me? They want more. That's what they get off on. More money, more bodies... You don't care. You're an employee. You could at least have said you loved me. I never loved you. And what use would it be? I don't exist. Adieu. Not like this. Let me get dressed. Gentlemen! Police. What are you waiting for? What do I do? Scram, quick. OK. OK! - Florence? - A woman? Didn't see her. One's waiting in your car. Get lost! Thanks. You're brave. I hope you'll stay lucky. It's you? Get out, now! - Who told you? - A weird cop. He said to pick you up and take you urgently. - Where? - The airport. Stop! Charles, you're there. Great. Your last program. I'll pay double the Americans. But I'll pay you later. OK? I'll explain. Drop it on my network. You've got the code? Thanks. Help yourself, brother. Thanks, Charlie. Thanks. I don't know what you're doing but good luck! What have you done? Destroyed 20 years of my life. X27 and all the other patents. They won't get me. - They'll know it's you. - No. Look. They wanted me dead. They paid for an empty shell. And in the boot? A game from Uncle Charles, for my dotage. What will you do, Zorro? You realise? Over a month without news. When you mentioned a letter... Listen: "To my loves, "Commandant Marcos is nice. "I'm developing computer-based revolution." "Cdt Marcos", "the revolution"... What's he up to now? Calm down. It's humour. I don't think it's funny. "I'll find you, as soon as I've begun again. "Don't worry if you get no news. "But I think about you. "If anyone asks, you've no news." Well, well. - Will you let me finish? - Yes. "Sell the dunes house. Too many bad memories." Not with me. Oh, sorry! Beg your pardon. Sorry. With my glasses... Are you local? Yes. I'm looking for a house. Do you know of any? Subtitles - Henry Moon for TELETOTA
