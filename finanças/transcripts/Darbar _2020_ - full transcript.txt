Please understand, sir! I need to meet the judge right away! -I need to meet him! Since 7 PM, six dons like you have turned informants. What kind of cop is that man, sir? He's a killer! A real savage! Just today, he has killed so many people! What made him change like this? He is looking for someone, sir. He doesn't seem to know who that person is. You folks got spooked and turned informant. Now, you are asking to be jailed! Here's a man on video, challenging him! Watch! "What's up?" "Think you're all that if you kill off these many people in one day?" "You bugger!" "Aaditya Arunasalam!" "Step up before me!" "I'm a hood who kills for money, too!" "I challenge you!" "Bring it on!" "Lay a hand on me if you can!" Jeez, sir! Think he's new. Damn, is he busted! He'll skewer him! Let's see. Let's see if he survives the night! (A classic Hindi song plays) Why did you come here? Leave right now! Calm down, bro! Why are you so worked up? I didn't come to see you! Amar Singh's birthday, right? That's why I'm here! Out of the way! What happened? Like he's some big shot, this guy dared the Commissioner, sir! Just today, the Commissioner has killed nine people! He'll come here looking for him and kill us, too! Fearing for his life, he came to the birthday party, sir. I'll leave. Trusting Amar Singh will protect me, I challenged him. What if you send me back and he kills me? The big man's reputation would go... Let's go. Hey! Hold on! Sir! Let him leave, sir! The Commissioner will definitely come here looking for him! Let him leave, sir. Seal the gate. Let's see who comes. Hit it! Didn't I tell you the Commissioner will come? Look! The Commissioner is busted, sir! He's dead meat! Tell us who you are looking for, sir! You're going around killing everyone! Get them quickly, Constable! What is all this? -Get everything ready! All ready! -On our way! Hurry up! Move it! Load them properly in the vehicle! The human rights officers have arrived! All officers get down here! Hurry up! Come along! So these encounter killings were acts of self-defense. Is that what you're going to say to me? I can tell by your bandages! You've got medical certificates too! What is it? I have my doubts about this encounter and have requested for a CBI enquiry. If you all want to leave this room in one piece... ...prepare the report per my instructions. How dare you? Do you know who she is? She's leaving with me. Try stopping us if you can. This is wrong. Striking people is very wrong! We've even killed! And you say striking people is wrong? On your mark! Shoot others, the human rights brigade shows up. Shoot the human rights brigade and who then, will show up? Sign it. Get signatures on two more blank sheets. We don’t have to trouble ma’am often. We must not spare him, ma'am! We must show them who we are! Who are you calling? We need to take action on them! -Wait! I've known him since his IPS training days. He doesn't even remember me. He's a totally different person now! I heard he's mentally disturbed. Last November, I too was at the function... ...when he was transfered from Delhi to Mumbai. He was with his daughter. 'Rip 'em up!' 'From now on, it’s gonna be me! I step up and my court, you are gonna see!' 'Gang may be yours. But, I’m the leader of leaders!' 'Billa, is my legacy! I've seen so many many!' 'I'm the lord of your hood!' 'Kick up a frenzy, everything blazes!' 'I step up, everything freezes!' 'Try stopping me, it'll be the end of you!' 'Try striking me, you'll rest in pieces!' 'With a fiery name and the stars you gave...' '...I remain the king today! Ask anyone!' 'Rip 'em up!' 'With dusky skin and a lion's panache...' 'Everything will be set on fire!' 'Rip 'em up!' 'From now on, it’s gonna be me! I step up and my court, you are gonna see!' 'Gang may be yours. But, I’m the leader of leaders!' 'Billa, is my legacy! I've seen so many many!' 'I'm the lord of your hood!' 'The Godfather of machismo, is our man!' 'He knows no limits! Don't dare mess with him!' 'One tight slap and your cheeks will be fried!' 'He is one wild dude! Don't cross his path!' 'Rip 'em up!' 'Be upright, you’ll be full of style!' 'When your eyes spark, whistles abound!' 'If there’s a trusting heart, you’ll be full of style!' 'When you hasten your step, it seems like a storm’s around!' 'If iron were to take a seat and rest in calm...' '...you will see rust in its place, shattering to tiny bits!' 'If you place your heart in hard work and take the first step...' '...youth will remain your twin forever!' 'Kick up a frenzy, everything blazes!' 'I step up, everything freezes!' 'Try stopping me, it'll be the end of you!' 'Try striking me, you'll rest in pieces!' 'With a fiery name and the stars you gave...' '...I remain the king today! Ask anyone!' 'Rip 'em up!' 'With dusky skin and a lion's panache...' 'Everything will be set on fire!' 'Rip 'em up!' 'From now on, it’s gonna be me! I step up and my court, you are gonna see!' 'Billa, is my legacy! I've seen so many many!' 'The Godfather of machismo, is our man!' 'He knows no limits! Don't dare mess with him!' 'One tight slap and your cheeks will be fried!' 'He is one wild dude! Don't cross his path!' 'With a fiery name... -Godfather of machismo!' 'And the stars you gave... -Don't dare mess with him!' 'I remain the king today! -One slap and your cheeks are fried!' 'With a fiery name and the stars you gave...' '...I remain the king today! Ask anyone!' 'Rip 'em up!' 'With dusky skin and a lion's panache...' 'Everything will be set on fire!' Rip 'em up! Thank you so much for coming, Aaditya. I know you're enjoying the party, but I have an important thing to show you. Look at this. 27 years ago, he was a major drug lord in Mumbai. In a run-in with the police, he burned seventeen cops alive, in public view. He escaped from India too. The cops couldn't do anything to him. Since then, the Mumbai Police Department have lost their standing among the public. People openly mock the police. Wearing the police uniform is considered shameful. So many police stations had job openings. Unfit people had to be assigned to these roles. As the police force grew weaker... ...drugs and women trafficking have risen, too. Today, every two in ten people are drug addicts. The police force isn't big enough to control this. We will detox it, sir. Your work on the Punjab operation was very good, Aaditya. Really impressive! Youngsters must come join the police force again. At the same time... ...the drug menace has to be eliminated. You're the right man for the job. -I'm honored, sir. You must go to Mumbai. Take up the role of the city's new Police Commissioner. I will do it, sir. You know this, sir. I have three conditions. One: I take a job, I won't leave until it's finished. Two: Ask me to spare someone, I won't oblige. Three: I won't shave my beard until I'm done. After that, I’m seeing him again only now. I don't know if he even remembers me. His daughter died recently, ma'am. His daughter? Hello Singh! Last saw you in 'Ramanaa'! This way, sir! The two of us are Telugu, sir. -Wow! I'm from Chirala. -Lovely! And you? -Prasad from Guntur, sir. Got it. I'm from Rajahmundry. How many years have you been working for him? Not years. It's only been six months. Just that I earn one lakh rupees more than him. Not bad! You earn more than him? That's what it says on paper. But I never get my hands on it. See that girl? Valli? -Yes. She's his daughter. She's the one who hired me. Do you see the watch on him? I must see to it that his heartbeat doesn't shoot up. If it does... Notice the girl taking out her phone? She'll get a mobile alert. Why? -She has my account details and password. Anytime he gets angry, 5,000 rupees from my account goes to her! Anytime he's happy, 10,000 rupees from her account comes to me! Wow! Super! -"Super"? That man is tensed all the time! So far, 60,000 rupees from my account has gone to her! Both father and daughter are gambling online with my money! I'll show them, one day! She laughs like actress Trisha! Are you married? I have a house built in Chennai. Sir promised to come for housewarming, too. If you come, we can talk to our parents and start the wedding plans! Time for your husband to come? I'm Rohit Kumar. My colleagues. -Hello, sir. I'm Ankur Jain. Is everything alright in the city? I noticed everyone's tense and confused, since I arrived. What's up? You're right, sir. I was wondering how to broach this subject with you, as you just got here. You take charge only this evening... It's alright. Tell me. Three college girls have been abducted in the city, an hour ago. One of those girls is the Deputy Chief Minister's daughter. When returning from a party... without realizing who she was... ...they have abducted her, sir. Let's meet the Deputy CM, now! You'll have to take charge. I am already in charge! Come! Tejaswini Desai is your daughter. Pooja Gupta, Neha Chopra... Are the three of them childhood friends or did they go to school/college together? Nothing of that sort. I don't know how they became friends! But they're thick friends. They've come home too! I see. Questioned the other two families? I don't know how my daughter became friends with the DCM's daughter. She studies really well, sir! She was a topper in high school! Studied in the United States! For some time, she was in a drug rehabilitation center. She had given it all up and was doing fine. The last three months, she has relapsed. I once saw a powder-like substance in her bag, like what you described. My daughter is allergic to alcohol. She would get mad at her father for drinking. I've never seen her use drugs, nor behave as if she was under influence. There are many kinds of drugs, ma'am. Some drugs cause people to seem withdrawn. And some cause people to seem hyperactive. Many mornings, I've seen white powder on my sister's nose. Cocaine! There's a bill for purchase of new shoes. From last morning. Adidas. Call that showroom! Around 11 AM yesterday! Were those male shoes or female shoes? Unisex, sir. Anyone can wear them. What's the shoe size? -Eleven inches. What is your daughter's shoe size? Seven! Did she take it as is, or did she... She had it gift-wrapped, sir. What did she write on the gift card? Just her name, sir. Send me a photo of the gift wrapping paper. There are four cocaine dealers in the city, sir. And eight sub-dealers. One of them celebrated his birthday, yesterday. Get him. -Yes, sir! You're correct. Kailash of Matunga. Cocaine dealer. Celebrated his birthday. But nobody knows where he lives, sir. Enquire at every wine shop in Matunga. Contact every bakery in the area. Check if a birthday cake was purchased in his name. A cake was ordered for him at 'Frostalicious', a cake shop in Matunga. Buy me a cake, sir. How do we find him in such a huge area? Go search! Give him the bill! The bill is 650 rupees, sir. Keep the change, Vicky. How do you know my name, sir? I spoke to you on the phone, kiddo. The house you delivered a cake yesterday... Show it to me. Get in the car. -Alright, sir. 'We're taking over this show!' 'Step it up! Back it up! Lock and Load!' 'Damn! You never seen this before!' 'Follow the leader now!' 'Stars on his shoulder crest!' 'His uniform, the armor of justice!' Up there! The fifth floor. -'His name slays their arrogance!' You all stay here. If you see me at that window in ten minutes, only then come up. 'The leader’s in total charge! His ways are always unique!' 'Try to run or hide, he'll strategize!' 'Anyone try stepping up! Get ready for war!' 'His ways are unique! Now and forever!' 'Who dares to step up before him?' 'He'll bring one hell of a fight!' 'Don't mess with him!' 'His ways are unique! Now and forever!' 'Who dares step up before him?' 'He'll bring one hell of a fight!' 'Don't mess with him!' 'The big brother!' 'He's a big brother to one and all!' 'A majestic king!' 'A king who hunts down arrogance!' 'Start praying now! His blows will strike you soon!' 'You will see soon, son! All are equal in his court of justice!' 'He waged wars and rose up! The people are with him!' 'Who dares oppose him? Million hearts scream his name!' 'Touch him, he's a raging bull! He'll gore you to shreds!' 'Do the crime, he'll see to it you do the time!' 'He's got a hunting brigade! Heart's on fire!' 'Victory spreads across the nation! All hail our King!' 'Touch him, he's a raging bull! He'll gore you to shreds!' 'Do the crime, he'll see to it you do the time!' 'He's got a hunting brigade! Heart's on fire!' 'Victory spreads across the nation! All hail our King!' Sir said he'd turn up at the window. But another guy's there! Look! There he is! Step down, big foot! Arrest them! What is it? Found her? Sorry, sir. Your daughter isn't here! We found another family here. You called repeatedly about birthdays and shoe sizes! I thought you would find her! I thought the same, sir... Many groups kidnap women in India. One of them abducted your daughter. We'll catch them! Don't worry. 36 members of the Legislative Assembly work for me! This entire government runs on my support! Go wherever you wish in the state! Take any permission you need! Beat and kill whoever you want! I want my daughter! Got it? This will suffice, sir. Until I say so, keep them safe at our place. But why? Until then... ...shall we clean up? Get ready for a major operation! Police is not a job. It is a service! We live to protect! We die to serve! 'We're taking over this show!' 'Step it up! Back it up! Lock and Load!' 'Damn! You never seen this before!' 'Follow the leader now!' 'Stars on his shoulder crest!' 'His uniform, the armor of justice!' 'His name slays their arrogance!' 'Aaditya Arunasalam!' 'The Commissioner! Come! Stand Up! Salute!' Run! The cops are here! Move quickly! 'Try to run or hide, he'll strategize!'- Let go of me! 'Anyone try stepping up! Get ready for war!' 'His ways are unique!' -Don't be scared! We're here to save you! Don't be scared! The cops are here to save you! Hold up, man! Where are you going? 'Don't mess with him!' 'His ways are unique! Now and forever!' 'Who dares to step up before him?' 'He'll bring one hell of a fight!' 'Don't mess with him!' I'm sorry. Your child is not in Mumbai. Possible that she may have been trafficked to Nashik or Pune. Nashik? I think she might even be in Goa, sir! I'll talk to that Chief Minister! I will fall at his feet if need be. I want my daughter back! Do whatever you want! -Thank you, sir! Keep the phone next to you. Don't fall sleep. Alright, man! 'Start praying now! His blows will strike you soon!' 'You will see soon, son! All are equal in his court of justice!' 'Touch him, he's a raging bull! He'll gore you to shreds!' 'Do the crime, he'll see to it you do the time!' 'He's got a hunting brigade! Heart's on fire!' 'Victory spreads across the nation! All hail our King!' Arunasalam! Aaditya Arunasalam! When a police team checked the Star Hotel via Skype... ...six girls were found drugged and unconscious. Just thirteen years of age! They had been abducted. Ajay Malhotra, the son of the hotel's owner Vinod Malhotra did not allow their rescue. Mid-conversation, he attacked our men. Three cops suffered head injuries and are at the hospital. This is Vinod Malhotra's place. Must be dealt carefully. My darlings! Neither is this a toy gun, nor am I a good cop! One of you move even an inch... ...I won't shoot up in the air or down at your knees. None of that crap flies with me. I aim straight for the heart! Out of the way! They drugged and ruined them, sir. They're just kids! This is Vinod Malhotra's son. Ajay Malhotra. Listen up! Lay your hands on me... ...you'll regret it. Why just the hand? I'll even lay my foot! Dear girl! Take off your slipper and slap him with it! Whack this prick! Whack him some more! Again! And again! Next shot is for your dad! Take him away! Return the kids Ajay Malhotra trafficked to you. If not, I will end you all! 'We're gonna round 'em up and clean 'em out!' 'The true Superstar! Then! Now! Forever!' 'Catch them liars! Set them on fire!' 'Moving up higher! Never retire!' 'Catch them liars! Set them on fire!' 'Moving up higher! Never retire!' Come, dear! Don't be scared! Don't be scared! We're cops! We're here to save you! Please don't be scared! Stay calm! "In a major operation led by the Mumbai Police..." "...several women and children abducted from major cities in Maharashtra..." "...and sold into the human flesh trade, were rescued...." "...and reunited with their families." "In this operation, the arrest of Ajay Malhotra..." "...son of businessman Vinod Malhotra, has created quite a stir!" "The efforts of Mumbai Commissioner Aaditya Arunasalam..." "...have been lauded by many." Hey, Commissioner. Hordes of women being rescued is shown on TV. Where is my daughter? She's the one we're looking for, sir! Yeah, keep saying that! Within one night, 2,586 girls were rescued across India! From 7 year old girls... ...to daughters separated from their parents for 38 years... ...all are being reunited with their familiies! But still, the Deputy CM's daughter is missing! Get the girls! Isn't that the Deputy CM's daughter? -Where had he hidden her? They kept her hidden after rescuing her! She was rescued within two hours of her abduction! Using this situation, we executed a huge operation... ...and rescued nearly 27,000 girls! In this operation, there have been three casualties. Two cops are under intensive care. We thank every one involved in this operation. For a finger injury, they injected glucose! Some doctor! When my dad who was the centre of action is unscathed, how did you get hurt? What are you saying, dear? He went all guns blazing! That left his finger like this! Stop it, sir! Nothing like that, dear girl. My finger got caught in the jeep door as it closed. That's the nature of police operations! Will a shirt not rip in battle? Right... -You're the one fighting! Why must my shirt rip? So unfair! -Alright, dad. What's next? A knot has been tied on his hand. It’s your turn next! My turn? You mean marriage? -Yes. I've told you already I will not let you be alone, dad! You must get married, dad! I have told you many times! My dear... first up, is your wedding. Next, is my wedding! No biggie! If I put my mind to it, I can land a bride in no time! Who? You? -Yeah! While off-duty, he'd tremble even when asking a girl for the time. He'd break into a nervous sweat when he had to talk to my school teacher. Nervous? Me? That was then! Now, I've tied a talisman around my waist! Is that so? -Yes! A talisman that instills bravery? Buy me one please! Thank You! -Dad... Look over there. Go over to that lady and tell her she's beautiful. That's it. -And if I do? If you do, you can start looking for a groom for me. Look at this! 'Who are you, my pretty?' Hasn't even begun, yet he gives a thumbs up! You are beau... beau... beau... Beauti... Oh crap... -See your dad's leg? Talk about call vibration. Look how it shakes! Look at the table! He texts even without a phone! I'm so sorry. I don't know Urdu. Nurse! Please come here! You are beau... beau... I think you must take him to the ENT. Looks like a throat problem. She'll take care of you. -No... no... no... Meet Dr. Sunita for your throat infection. Ward number four... -I am okay! You are not alright. You're my patient! Take this. Token number 24! She gave him a token and told him to check in! Let's get him out before he gets operated on! All that swagger for freaking nothing! Happens... Sometimes it happens... My dear... just that the lady was so incredibly pretty... You were watching too, so I got a tad nervous! Wait and see how I woo that lady next time! We did see! Asked you to talk, you return with a token, like a patient! I'll deal with you later! No point relying on your father. Find a nice guy like me and elope! Vinod Malhotra is at the Commissioner's office! He refuses to leave! He's getting tensed! Well then... what brings ladies to the police station? Listen to me, sir. What does this boy not have? Is all this necessary? His photo is everywhere! Newspaper, TV, you name it! We're plagued with calls from our relatives! Please let him go, sir. No need to file a case. Also, tell me how much is your fee. He's here, right? Bring over my son! Look, ma'am. Your son committed a crime. We'll stick to what the court says. The court has given its verdict. Bail. Bail? -Yes. Two constables who were at the hotel that day... They've given a statement that Mr. Ajay Malhotra... ...was not in the room that day. That he was elsewhere. I see... They've given a statement that the girls were alone in another room, too. So here is the bail. Oh, there seems to be a mistake! The stamp on page three is on the left, when it should be on the right! Sir... same paper, same page! Doesn't matter if it's on the right or left. Same thing! Not at all! What must be on the right, should be so! Go get it changed. Until then, your boy will be safe here! We'll leave. I can get my son out very easily. No, sir. He assaulted four constables. Two are in intensive care. Six girls. A case of abduction. Medical reports aren't here yet. May even turn out to be a rape case. They're all under seventeen. He drugged them, too! As far as I know, he'll be in prison for sixteen years! Pray to God that nothing happens to my son. Else, many people will go missing at the Commissioner's office. Two cops are under intensive care. You better pray nothing happens to them, too! Strip their uniforms and send them home! Per my instructions, prepare a report and submit it to the court. Render this an urgent case and ensure he doesn't get out anytime soon! Damn! All my clothes are in soak. Dad and daughter have left me stranded! What are you going to do? Tell me! What else? Just stand in the smoldering heat! I have an idea, man! "An idea?" Damn! I'm so nervous! I feel weird... -You're fine, dad! This, is that girl! Right here! And this, is that boy. Me! "Boy"? Who? You? I'll deal with you later, kiddo! And this... ...is Roundtana! Now, this girl jogs her way down this path. And this boy, jogs his way from the other side. She comes... He goes... Suddenly, they stop! Girl looks at boy. Boy looks at girl. She gazes! He gazes! She moves forward! He moves forward! You pick up your gun! -Yes! And open fire on the girl! Exactly! What the hell, dad? What is this, sir? You plan your wooing like you plan an encounter killing! Bit too much, huh? -Yeah right! Top of that, you claim to be 'a boy'! Go say what comes from the heart, sir! Just a second. What's with the Pongal greetings? I thought so! -Damn! Taking cues from 'Kadhalar Dhinam' Kunal? Carries a rose in his pocket! Jeez! You be quiet! It's getting late, dad. Get going! Yes! I'll leave now! I'm going now! -You're ready! Go! I'm going now! -Get going, sir! Must I be doing this at my age? Not at all, but what to do? Look, dear. Soon as I talk to her, I'll find you a groom! Sure. -I'll put out an ad in the papers! Alright, dad! I'll put up ads on all matrimonial websites! Fine, dad! Shall I take this car? You can even take a share auto if you wish! Here! Tuck it in your ear! What is it for? -We'll listen in on your chat! Go! Surveillance, huh? Forget surveillance and Santosh Sivan lens! Just get going! I'll deal with you later! It's time, dad! Go! Good luck! -Thank you! The phone! (A devotional song plays on the radio) Change the song, sir! Devotional song, man! It will only get you holy offerings. Not love! Please change the song, sir! You mean like a romantic song? (A romantic song plays on the radio) No cars on the road, sir. Why honk from a stopped car? Horns aren't just for driving. To get someone's attention... ...we honk, turn on wipers and flash lights, too! Class in session at the driving school! Where are they all running to? They're jogging. And you? -I'm about to go jog, too! Come! I'll drop you off ahead of them! Going jogging, sir! It's okay! Come along! Come on, baby! My God... You saved girls all over the state. In the end, I couldn't save even my own daughter! Sorry... I'm sorry... She began yelling because she couldn't have drugs. So they locked her up. She couldn't control herself. Very difficult for them to live without drugs, sir. Many of the girls you saved, are behaving violently in the hospital. Plenty of suicide attempts too! Ajay Malhotra supplied drugs across the city, sir. Because you arrested him, the drug supply has completely dried up. Without drugs, addicts act violently and commit suicide, sir. Health Secretary. Dean. Rehabilitation Specialist. You know why I sent for you on such short notice? Those getting out of the drug habit, need your help right away. Yes, sir. We can organize many camps, provide fine treatment... ...and slowly get them healthy again. -Good! You ensure they do not relapse. I will ensure drugs do not resurface. Right? Today, 90% of drugs have been stopped! Do you know why? The only reason is... Ajay Malhotra! We arrested him two days ago on charges of women trafficking. He's the city's biggest drug dealer. As he is behind bars, drugs haven't come into the market. Should he get out, he will become a dangerous force in ten-fifteen years! So file every drug case there is against him! The cases must be air tight! He must not be released for another 30 years! "Greetings! Today's headlines!" "On the case of abduction of minors, Mumbai High Court has imposed a life sentence..." "...to Ajay Malhotra and incarcerated him at the Nashik Jail." "As it has also come to light that he is involved in drug smuggling..." "...Mumbai Commissioner Aaditya Arunasalam has requested the court..." "...that he be detained in police custody, for interrogation." Looks like my salary will be credited this month! You all ready? -Where are we going? Oh no! -What is it, sir? What's wrong, sir? Who is it? -Belt loose? It's nothing. Why are you sweating? -No fan, right? Room's air-conditioned! -Never mind! Listen! See that lady on the third bench? Ask her what she wants. -Alright, sir. Who is it? Ms. You Know Who! What is this? You asked her to come? -No. What brings her here, Kaushik? How should I know, sir? Don't know if my account will lose or gain money. Relying on that, I ordered a paint job at my house! She came to file a complaint. On whom and for what? She suspects someone is following her around. Her car went missing yesterday. She thinks he took it. She wants to a file a complaint about it. Bring her over. -Hey! Let her come! We'll handle it. Just a second, sir. Before she comes in, put on these glasses and up the style factor! Put them on, sir. She's coming in. Turn around and dig through files! Come in, ma'am! You said someone was following you, right? What did he look like? He looked pretty stylish. Can't call him a youngster or an old man. Can't call him fair-skinned or dark-skinned. He didn't even seem like a thief. He looked really dapper! Most thieves look dapper. If I showed you pictures of suspects, can you identify him? Yes, I can. Just give me the complaint. What happened? He was the one who followed me! Just a minute, ma'am! Make something up! The thing is... to ensure the city is safe, he follows random people... ...and asks for their opinion. -Yes! As he wasn't in uniform, you were alarmed. I'm so sorry, sir. I presumed... It's alright! No issue! Please sit down. Just chill and chat, ma'am! I'm so sorry. Didn't know you were the new Commissioner. I've seen the name 'Aaditya Arunasalam' in the newspapers and on TV. But, never in person. That's why I got confused. -Don't worry. My name is Lily. I'm an interior designer. -Sweet name! Good career! My card details are in here. -Give it to her. You wanted an opinion that day, right? -Really? If it's fine with you, we can talk about it in a coffee shop. I'm sorry. I don't drink coffee. I had Ranga and filter coffee in my youth in my hometown. I can’t stand all this 'instant coffee' stuff! If one asks to meet for coffee, it means they want to meet you alone! Don't go deep diving into Billa or Ranga coffee and ruin it! Sure, we can meet today! At 6 PM! We can make it! -Alright, then! My phone number is in the complaint letter. Just text me. Get Valli on the phone! Tell her the appointment is fixed! "Appointment"? Are you going to the dentist? Dating, sir! A date with Lily! 'Even if this face cannot show any trace of romance...' ‘...would you still stick by my side?’ 'I'm an outstanding single guy, my dear!' 'To twinkle bright, it's you, this star needs in sight!' 'I went to the market to make a purchase, my daisy!' 'Nothing there that caught my fancy!' 'Won’t the calendar at home call out an auspicious date?' 'Valentine’s Day on the first of April! Is that to be my forever fate?' 'Will I take you out to movies and fulfil these ambitions?' 'Will I ever be in a couples' seat? Or is it only me, till death, I meet?' My favorite color is yellow. Favorite dish is Pav Bhaji. My favorite game is cricket. I love Sheela Unnikrishnan's dancing. Also, I love fish. Fish! I love those, too! Fried seer fish! Shark steamed rice! Barbecued anchovies! Catfish, too! When actor Sivaji put it into his mouth in the film 'Muthal Mariyathai'... ...and pulled out just the bones... What's wrong? When I said I liked fish, I meant goldfish and colored fish. The ones in fish tanks. Oh! Colored fish! What dish can be made from them? 'I'll live on your money. Still, accept me, honey!' 'I'll sing out of tune!' 'Bear it, without a murmur!' 'Turn this tail-less ape into your friend!' 'Take care to keep off tears from my eyes!' 'Who is the perfect fit for my heart?' 'Who makes my blood run red? Only you!' 'My love balance is zero, just see!' 'You are the unpaid debt of the absconding liquor baron!' 'I'm an outstanding single guy, my dear!' 'To twinkle bright, it's you, this star needs in sight!' 'I went to the market to make a purchase, my daisy!' 'Nothing there that caught my fancy!' 'Won’t the calendar at home call out an auspicious date?' 'Valentine’s Day on the first of April! Is that to be my forever fate?' 'Will I take you out to movies and fulfil these ambitions?' 'Will I ever be in a couples' seat? Or is it only me, till death, I meet?' 'Even if this face cannot show any trace of romance...' Whoa! Four hundred and eighty rupees? Too much! Two hundred and forty. Your share! Her share of two forty? Why do you want your dad to get married? My mother died when I was two years old. As long as I can remember, I have always seen him alone. Once I get married and leave home, he will feel even more lonely. That's why I'm doing this. Don't take it personally. Tell him Commissioner Aaditya Arunasalam is here from Mumbai. Mumbai Commissioner Arunasalam is here. What do I do? Does he have a permission letter? Ask him for it. Open the gate. Purpose of visit? Vinod Malhotra's son Ajay is held here on charges of drugs and women trafficking. We have arrested the dealers who worked with him. But I don't know where Ajay Malhotra gets the drugs. Once we find that and arrest them too, we can shut down the entire drug market! So, I need to question Ajay Malhotra for about ten minutes. Your officers can be present, too. Here's a court order for it. They got cell phones in here? All it takes is money and they can go shopping too! I want Ajay Malhotra. He is not Ajay Malhotra. He is the same Ajay Malhotra you came to meet. I want Vinod Malhotra's son Ajay Malhotra, whom I caught with my own bloody hands! He is the Ajay Malhotra you caught! Get up! Who are you? I'm Ajay Malhotra, sir! You made a little girl slap me here with her slipper. Don't you remember? Why I ought to... -He's a convict of this jail! Let him go! Please let him go! I think there's been some confusion, sir. No confusion. A proxy! He's a damn proxy! Ajay Malhotra could have been sent abroad. They paid another man to go to prison and impersonate him. Due to the Borivali incident 27 years ago, the police lost their standing. They used to mock us behind our backs. After your operation, the police have regained their respect. If the public finds out that another man is in jail in his place... ...they'll completely lose faith in us again, sir. Playing games, are they? That too, with me? May as well start my game! A call from the Delhi office for you. I have an urgent matter to discuss with you, Aaditya Arunasalam. Come to Delhi right away! Yes, sir! The job assigned to you is complete. When are you returning? No, sir. My mission is not over. As soon as it is done, I'll be back. No, no, no... This assignment is over. I already told you I won't leave it halfway or spare anyone you ask. You agreed to my terms and sent me there. When I say 'clean', I mean completely clean! No matter where that guy is, I will not spare him. What? I have decided to appoint another Police Commissioner for Mumbai. You may leave! Is that so? Who will you appoint? Phone is right over there. Go ahead and try. Take up charge as Commissioner of Mumbai, tomorrow. Why must he know? This is a government decision. Careful with that tone! Mind your words! The Mumbai Police will do anything I say! Despite that, if you try replacing me... ...every single cop will go on strike! A Mumbai devoid of police. Scary to even think about it, huh? Please don't interfere in that guy's affair. I know what to do to him and how to do it. They are very dangerous people. Tell him he can have cops flank him on the left or the right. Never straight against him! See you! Shameful that after committing a crime so huge, he's free thanks to a proxy. Yes, proxies are highly condemnable. Seen a video of a convict in the South who often gets to visit out of jail. A team of eight high officials must inspect that jail, right away! We'll assign a team. It must be done immediately. Alright. We'll do that. "Per the request of Aaditya Arunasalam, an eight official team has been set up..." "...by the government to investigate Ajay Malhotra..." "...who is suspected to have an impersonator at Nashik Jail." "This team will be dispatched to the prison today, to begin their investigation." Those eight officers have reached Nashik Jail, sir. They have submitted photographic evidence of the man in prison. Those would be Ajay Malhotra's images, right? Yes, sir! What atrocity, sir! When actor NTR gets into a fight, he gets beaten up first. Do you know why? To keep the audience in suspense? You take a beating from the enemy to learn about their strength. To know who their allies are. To learn about their methods. They are still not aware. That this is not a beard, but a mask! You are all experts at forging passports, certificates and documents, in this city. You made a fake passport for this man in the photo and sent him abroad. Which country? Thailand, sir. What are you guys doing? Hitting a parked car? I'm sorry, brother. Our car is damaged, too! We need to call the cops! No! Please don't call the cops! Take this money. Take it and go! I need the insurance. My car is damaged. Don't call the police. Take this money! I'll buy you a brand new car! I'll buy you a brand new... Are you drunk? Just a beer. And you? Which country are you from? It's not my fault, sir. Their fault. They banged my car. Show me your passport! But it's not my fault, sir. They banged against my car! Check him! Why check me, sir? Check them! It's not my fault! But why check me? He's the one who banged against me. It's not my fault. Why are you checking me? Take him to the vehicle! Just take this money! Can you please send me his passport copy, Amraim? Yes! I'll send it now! "Anil Pawar." An Indian criminal has been arrested in Thailand for using fake passport. I want him to be deported back to India, immediately. Alright, sir. Please come. Please have a seat. The Ambassador is in a meeting. I don't even know how he managed to get caught! Contact all our men and the higher officials in Thailand! I want my son back! Do you all understand? Seems you're trying to get your son released from Thai Police custody. Who is this? Aaditya Arunasalam. Mumbai's Police Commissioner. You? No matter how hard your men try, the Thai Police will not release your son. Can I offer a solution? You're an industrialist. The Thai government will not listen to an industralist's demands. But they will listen to the Indian government. Eight government officials have signed off that your son is in Nashik Jail. If that is proven false, the government will be in trouble! Tell them that and they'll be scared spitless! Have the Indian government talk to the Thai government. They will release your son right away. I help you out so much in such difficult times! Keep this in mind and cooperate whenever needed, boss! That Commissioner calls me personally and gives me ideas. I'm confused. He gets me in trouble... But offers solutions, too. Could he have a hidden agenda? As far as I can tell, there is none. If we get Ajay out of the Thailand Jail, like he suggested... ...we can then relocate him to another country. By now, the eight officers who had lied would have lobbied with the Indian govt. They'll ask the Indian government to request the Thai govt. to release him. That government would call this embassy... ...to tell us that Ajay Malhotra's passport is genuine. You can go in, now. Please come. -Alright! I just spoke with the Thai government, Mr. Commissioner. They have confirmed that the passport copy you gave and the person they arrested... ...are the same. There is no confusion, sir. Our police force has released him. I appreciate it. Get the chopper to Nashik Jail! Hello, Kuldeep! How are you? Surprised? -Sir... How do you know my name? It has been proven you're Ajay Malhotra, right? So why must we pretend? We know I can't do anything about it. I hear you kill elderly people. Why is that, dear boy? Oh, that? It's real easy to kill old people, sir! They can neither run nor fight back! That's so true! -Yes! So, I target such folks and this became a habit! So killing them is really easy? -Yes, sir! Just pop them and go about your day? -Totally! Ajay Malhotra was shot dead by Mumbai's Commissioner in self-defense! Tell that to the officers and the press! After the autopsy, let them know the body will be placed for public viewing! What are you looking at? Originally, I was a villain, my boy! How's that? Eighteen of us got caught when trying to save your son. The body will be inspected by judges of the High Court. They will then release the body from jail for public and press viewing. The moment the body is out for viewing, the proxy issue will be out, too. It is not just our problem. It is a problem for all those who helped us, too. Including the two governments. We are all busted! We will all be destroyed! All for trying to save your son! Put me on speaker, dear fellow! Had you been busted earlier for proxy, you would've been the only one to go down. Now, joining you will be two judges, the ruling and opposition parties... ...the internal affairs minister and a collector. Two countries involved! International news, isn't it? You all must feel stuck with no way out, right? Shall I give you an idea? Option A: All of you plead guilty and go to prison. You. Your son. All of you. Here's Option B. Sneak your son back here from Thailand... ...kill him at the same spot and present his body for public viewing. What's bigger: One or Eleven? I'll leave the decision to you. Take note. The police is helping you so much in such difficult times! Keep this in mind and cooperate whenever needed. Got it? "Our correspondents are presently outside Nashik Jail." "As rain continues to pour down there..." "...Commissioner Aaditya Arunasalam has stated..." "...Ajay Malhotra's body will be out for public viewing." "Was it really Ajay Malhotra who died, or was it someone else in his place?" "As this question looms, we can expect it to be answered shortly..." "...when the body is made available for viewing." Other than the two ways he proposed... ...I don't see any other alternative. So you ask me to sacrifice my only son to save all our skins! Right? Trying to save your son, eighteen of us are now in trouble. At our age, how can we go to jail? It is your duty to save them! Listen up. Do whatever the hell you want! You needn't tell me anything! We'll land in big trouble. He's taken off from Thailand in a private jet. Still haven't told him yet. Listen up. Whatever you plan to do, do it soon! After this, no more Thailand. Going to Amsterdam! Want to come? What the hell, man? There's press out at the main gate! What brings them here? I can't act as a corpse for too long! Nine inches, sir. No need for you to act as a corpse. Ajay Malhotra has been shot dead and replaced. I am one bad dude! Have courage. Look how brave your wife is! I don't know what's going to happen. He will destroy us all. He is not my son. The man who burned cops alive in Borivali and escaped, 27 years ago? Hari Chopra, that very man! Ajay is his son! I send him over once a year! He gave Ajay to me when he was two! How am I supposed to face him? All is lost! I feel very proud and happy to have been your leader... ...all these years. One among you... After me... ...must take up this responsibility. To be an international drug lord... ...you need courage to go against the police! The only one amongst you who possesses such courage... ...is Hari Chopra! If it gets known that the man who will succeed me is Hari Chopra... ...the Mumbai Police will wet themselves in fear! The Mumbai Police... ...have killed your son. I am so sorry. Who is that cop? I am a bad cop! There they are! Hello! My daughter is getting ready. On her way! Tell her to hurry! -Come, dear! She is here! This is my daughter. Hi! -Hello! Say 'hello'. "You look gorgeous!" "You look so pretty!" "You look so hot!" "After the wedding, we will move to London!" I'm sorry, guys! I will not send my daughter abroad! If you are fine with it, e-mail me your details. Alright? "Can I have your daughter's number?" How dare you ask her dad! I'm sorry, guys. My wedding can happen only after my dad’s wedding! "Your dad's not married yet?" -Shut all this down! Go marry white girls! -What is this? Online matrimonial, dear! -Jeez! Focus on clicking with Lily! How irresponsible you are! What a lucky father to have such a daughter! Alright, then... I've been trying little by little, dear. At the rate you are going, 200 years will pass by! When do you intend to propose marriage to her? Eighth lunar day, today. Ninth, tomorrow. Raunchy ten, next! Hey! -'Juicy treats for you!' Listen, dear. Tomorrow is Monday. Auspicious day. Auspicious hour between 9:30 and 10:30 AM. I'll conduct a ritual for Lord Ganesha break 31 coconuts in the morning... ...pray to all our deities... Sounds like it’s a groundbreaking ceremony! Not a love proposal! Sounds like an elaborate ritual! Help me out! -If I could, I'd be married by now! For your sake, I will try. We start with facewash! Dad! Lily! -What is it? Sorry, it's for you. Always hounding me about Lily... -She's crossing our path herself. Come! Let's go! -Coming, dear! You talk! -Shall I? Hello, Valli! -Hello, Lily! Both are bullies! Your dad around? -He's here! I'll get him! I'm listening in on speaker! I need to meet you. Can you come to Aishwarya Marriage Hall at Andheri West? Today is not auspicious! -Tell her you'll come! Alright, I will come! Alright. Thanks! Lovely! You go with him! What better work I have? -Hold on! Get your sunglasses. Put them on. Go stylishly like this! He just has to walk to show style, my dear! How stylish am I? Beat it! You left your shoes behind. Wear them on your hands! Vinod Malhotra speaking. Tell me. -Is your father around? No, he has gone out. I'm in great danger. The danger is not just to me, but to you all, too. Tell your father to call me. -I'll let him know. Why did she ask me to come to a wedding hall? With such romantic overtures, you'll need 40 years! So it seems she directly took the marriage route! You think so? -Yes, sir! Like a surprise birthday, this is a surprise wedding! "Surprise wedding?" Not a chance! Valli must turn up. Elders must be spoken to. "Elders"? Who? Sage Bodhidharman? He's the only one elder to you. Come on! -Sorry! Did not mean it! Go! Sister! -Yes? Uncle is here! Greetings! -Hello! Hello! What is this? Out of the blue... My dad. My mom. -Can't see the resemblance. My uncle's son. My family members. -Hello. Lily has told us a lot about you, sir. All is fixed, I guess! They are looking at you. Thing is... why did you ask me to come here... out of the blue? Because... -Don't be shy! The child's chain has gone missing! We wanted to file a complaint at the station. That was when I remembered you and called. You have been royally deceived! You want me to retrieve the child's missing chain? Yes. -The Commissioner? O Lord Muruga! Why such a trial? Is it made of gold, dear? -Kiddo? Uncle? -Where exactly did you lose the chain? If I knew that, would I not have retrieved it myself? Why must we call you? She's been well-trained, sir! You brat! Very important case! -Yes! That is why they called us! Very important case! Let us look inside! Come! Instead of searching, you sing! -Only then can I find the chain! Sing! 'Wedding drums nod their heads!' 'Let blessed sounds fill the air!' 'Crackers shout out the wedding joy!' 'Let the wedding be infused with high energy!' 'As the groom fawns over the bride...' '...the relatives hide behind without a word!' 'As mischief and banter fill this revelry...' '...unbridled joy becomes one with the air!' 'Wedding drums nod their heads!' 'Let blessed sounds fill the air!' 'With trust, she has come with you to lead a life till the end of time.' 'Guard her as if she were a queen!' 'For you, he'll forego his desires!' 'Make him live as if he were a king!' 'If she knows how to slay his worries, she can win him over!' 'If he knows how to lose to her, he can win over the world, entire!' 'Wedding drums nod their heads!' 'Let blessed sounds fill the air!' 'Crackers shout out the wedding joy!' 'Let the wedding be infused with high energy!' 'As the groom fawns over the bride...' '...the relatives hide behind without a word!' 'As mischief and banter fill this revelry...' '...unbridled joy becomes one with the air!' 'In the rush of youth, as you shower kisses it is love you must give!' 'Even after it’s been forty years, love must glow in your hand-hold!' 'All those pretty fights over the years will make you understand hearts within!' 'Every other human bond is contained in this wedding bond!' 'As a guardian to your soul in your time in this soil...' '...another soul strives to beat!' 'As the purpose to thrive upon this soil...' '...a wife and a wedding will reward you!' 'Wedding drums nod their heads!' 'Let blessed sounds fill the air!' 'Crackers shout out the wedding joy!' 'Let the wedding be infused with high energy!' 'As the groom fawns over the bride...' '...the relatives hide behind without a word!' 'As mischief and banter fill this revelry...' '...unbridled joy becomes one with the air!' If you live as friends and not just as husband and wife… ...life will turn out great! I am Lily's cousin. Her uncle's son. We met at the wedding yesterday! What will you have? -Nothing for me. Thank You. Lily has often told us the city's Commissioner is her friend. We did not believe her. This is... Former President K.R. Narayanan, right? Yes. I got this in 1998. You won an award? -Yes. Think Lily would have been eleven years old, back then. Is she your daughter? -Yes, she is. Lily is the only daughter for both our families. Too pampered! She stubbornly refuses to get married! My aunt and uncle are pretty scared. That she's getting older and someone not suitable might distract her. You're father to a daughter, too. As a father, you will know the feeling. I noticed you both at the wedding, yesterday. When I was coming here, some friends offered to come too. I told them not to. You being the city's Commissioner, thought I'd ask nicely, first. All of a sudden, if your daughter showed up with someone like you... ...how would you feel? I lost my mother when I was six. At least I had it easy. Valli lost her mother when she was two. To ensure she smelt her mother's scent... ...I'd lay my wife's saree on myself and have my daughter sleep upon it. Valli does not know to be stubborn or angry. All she has ever asked of me is Lily. You know the risks and dangers of a cop's life. Anything can happen any time. If anything ever happened to me, I wanted a companion for her and so agreed. Don't worry. Whatever you dread, will not happen. See you, sir. You haven’t had anything to eat? It's okay. Thank You. -Alright, sir. When did you get here? What happened? Valli dear... Dad! I'm so sorry, dad. It is alright, dear. -I'm so sorry! No, dear. Don't cry. Because of me, some damn guy... -No, not at all! I'm so sorry, dad. -He does have a point. No! How can he say such a thing? He should not have! I wanted to ensure you had a companion before I left... I'm so sorry! -There there... Stop crying. Please... Alright, then. Dad? -Yes? Let us go out. You and me. -Yes! Just as my father. Leave the uniform, duty, everything behind! Alright? We'll go out and have fun! -Yes! We'll cheer up! Okay? -Totally! That's the spirit! This place is secure, right? It is the office of my old TV channel. No longer operational. Completely safe and secure. This place is very popular among criminals. Where is he? Inside. He is scared out of his wits. Brother... Until now... ...I raised him like he was my own son. That Commissioner... Did you bury him? Or cremate him? No, brother... I laid him to rest after the last rites were properly conducted. I did it right. I brought you a gift. Come on in! Give it to me. Beautiful, isn't it? If I shove it like this and press... ...it will go inside... ...and get lodged like an umbrella! Only when I twist it around and pull it out like so... ...can I close it. No, brother. Please listen to what I have to say. Made in Germany. Beautiful! Shall I demonstrate? -No, brother. How about you? Here! Over here! Brother... Please listen... Please listen to what I have to say. Please listen, brother. This is... ...for my son! Hey! He's screaming too much! Get him out of here! Bring my knife back when you return. It's my favorite! Where is that Police Commissioner now? His death must make every cop afraid to wear that uniform! Shahrukh starts his car! The car starts with a noise that sounds like Shahrukh himself! Hello, Valli? Where are you? Infinity Mall, Malad. Is Sir with you? He is. -I called his phone. It was unreachable. You must not have gone without an escort. Just for one day, right? Alright. Do not go anywhere alone. Vinod Malhotra is missing. We do not know where he is. Really? -Yes. Don't tell Sir anything. Text me your whereabouts every fifteen minutes. Alright, sir. Will do. My dear? -Dad? Check if there is a 20-22 year old man in this compartment... ...in a floral shirt, holding a cell phone. Yes, dad. What is this, dad? Surveillance! I will call for an escort! No! Hold on! We will be alone at the next station. Let them know! Sit down. Are you afraid? Look! I think that is Commissioner Aaditya Arunasalam! Hello! -Good Evening! Saw him on TV, didn't you? -Yes! Me? -Indeed! Sing a rousing song. I sure will! It is our pleasure! Listen to this! -Let us begin! 'The king has arrived! His court is in session, today!' 'Cut out the power and set the tiger on fire!' Hey! Why the hell are you singing in Hindi? Leader here, is one of us! Step aside! 'Behold the pride in his eyes! He comes to whip you hard!' 'Our leader is a class apart! Tread with care!' 'Your face will get swollen and twisted out of shape!' 'You'll hear birds chirp around your ears!' 'Limbs will get relocated! Life will get splintered!' 'It would step on the ladder to the god of death!' 'Behold the pride in his eyes! He comes to whip you hard!' 'Our leader is a class apart! Tread with care!' 'My King!' 'His gaze is sharper than chillies! Makes you sweat by the gallons!' 'Step up, you big wannabes!' Crouch down and say his name!' 'Order a blazing beating, swallow the fire he throws your way...' 'If you wish to survive, simply touch the earth and surrender!' 'Behold the pride in his eyes! He comes to whip you hard!' 'Our leader is a class apart! Tread with care!' 'My King!' Dad! Watch out, dad! He's right behind you! Thank you very much, sir! See you! May you live a hundred years, brother! Dad? Dad! I got a call this morning, dad. Vinod Malhotra is in trouble... What's wrong, dad? Get going. What is happening here? -What is going on? Doctor... Her ears are bleeding. What? Alright, I'm coming. So sorry, ma'am. We can't let you leave. -I have to go! Please understand. -It is an emergency! Please try to understand! -Nothing we can do. Please take your seat. What happened, dear? Zoom in a little bit. This looks like a haemorrhage. Further down. How is my father, doctor? When will he regain consciousness? He has had a concussion. It is a type of traumatic brain injury. He will be unconscious for another five hours. That's not a critical issue. He should be alright. -Thank you, doctor! Thank you so much! -Sit down. Please have a seat. But... After seeing your report... ...I am a little worried. There is leakage of blood in three places in your brain. The blood leakage is increasing! Within two hours, the blood will leak out... ...spread into your tissues... ...and into your brain... This is called 'Subdural Hematoma'. So... Did anyone accompany you? Any relative or elder? Anyone? Since birth... ...my father is the only person I have. My mother... My friend... My everything. For him to regain consciousness... ...it will take five more hours. But for you... In another two hours... How do I explain it to you? Stay by your father's side for a little while. Dad... Dad... What's wrong, sir? What the hell is happening? How did he die? I wanted to kill him myself! He had many business rivals! There have been three attempts on his life! No! There has been a mistake somewhere! I can't take it! Relax, sir! -You must not get worked up! Your treatment isn't over yet! An old rival must have killed him! We will find out! Some gang killed my daughter through an accident. Some gang killed Vinod Malhotra, too! Who are they? Are they or are they not connected? My heart is telling me to nab them, but I don't know who to go after! My mind screams at me to chase after them, but where do I begin? I will take them out! I will eliminate every damn ruffian in Mumbai! Don't do it, sir! Please listen to us, sir! That was when the Commissioner turned so violent, ma'am. I heard he forced you at gunpoint to get this report made. I am returning the papers which he forced you to sign. Please ensure you take no action against him. That is not for me to decide. I am just one human rights official. That's all. Like a court of law, this is a huge organization. I will send over my report. My higher-ups will have to make the decision. If they take action, there's a possibility Aaditya Arunasalam may lose his job. Until then, see to it he makes no further encounter killings. At least two of you tell the truth. This gun has only six bullets. There are eight of you here. You tell me. Sir... I don't know anything, sir... Talk! Hey! Shut up! We are in the middle of a chat! If you must cry, do it quietly! You talk! I swear we were not behind the attack! Then who did it? -I don't know! None of our men were involved in your daughter's accident! Our group has nothing to do with Vinod Malhotra! We didn't do it! -Don't do it, sir! Get lost! Keep talking! We didn't do this, sir! There has been bad blood between Vinod Malhotra and Gulshan Kumar. They have even had shootouts! Question him! Who is he? If you want to kill us, go ahead. But we did not kill Vinod Malhotra! Vinod Malhotra killed your daughter. If someone killed him, it's good for you, right? What do you have to gain by knowing who killed him? You're killing everyone like a raving lunatic! That Commissioner is filled with murderous rage. In his hunt for the killer, he has done thirteen encounter killings so far! I had planned to kill him along with his daughter. But in the two hours she was alive, he was unconscious. After that, he woke up! When he sought out his daughter, she was dead! In a fit of rage, he went to kill Vinod Malhotra. But he was already dead! The shock and pain he felt then... I wouldn’t have had that satisfaction even if he had died! At least let us kill him now! No! No! No! In the past, kings would catch a rebel... ...but not kill him! They would gouge his eyes out! Do you know why? If he was killed, as long as that king is alive... ...the rebel would be remembered! They'd erect statues in his honor. Others would rise up in his stead. But if you gouge his eyes? He would be reduced to begging for food... ...and lie destitute on the street corner! Seeing him so, everyone would shiver in fear of the king! I will seize that Commissioner's police vehicle. I will seize the house the government gave him. If he dies after that, it won't be breaking news! It would just be a thumb-sized article on the eighth page of the newspaper! His police team covers up every encounter killing he does! How would he lose his job? They are only covering up deaths of others, right? What if they themselves die? I met the doctor. It seems your treatment isn't over yet. You have been on duty, day and night, for twelve days. Without any rest, your team's been with you the entire time... Duty is not over yet. I told you! You forgot! I do not know when it will finish. That's the nature of a cop's job! Put the phone on speaker. Hello, sweetheart! You must not cry! Be a good boy, have dinner and go to sleep. Mommy will be home soon! Alright? If you were to take some rest... They too will... Feed him and put him to sleep, Santosh. Guys! Sir is calling! I am sorry. I have given you all a lot of trouble. I have many unanswered questions about my daughter's death. I don't know which way to go. In that frustration, I have caused trouble for you. You all go home. Spend some time with your families... ...and come back tomorrow. Sir... You go home, too... Who is there for me at home? You haven't eaten properly, sir. None of you have eaten since morning either, right? I will order food, right now! Where's my phone? Got a phone, right? Order food! Get in! Call an ambulance! These seem like serious injuries! No, sir! Just minor bruises! -Nothing major, sir. Five guys on the other side are dead! Sorry... This is all my fault. You don't need to apologize, sir. "Shootout in the street, yesterday!" "By whom? The Commissioner has done so many encounter killings..." "...and these guys launched a counter attack!" "Does he think if he kills pointlessly for personal animosity, they'd be quiet?" "The police department don't like him! With no alternative, they suffer him!" "Out of stress, some might commit suicide! The man has gone insane!" Don't mind them, sir. They'll say anything for money. If paid, they'll even take our side! The Human Rights Commission have sent their report. You have been suspended and transfered for the shootout that took place. Nice. I expected this. Careful, sir! I'm leaving. You needn't worry about this watch or texts about your salary anymore. Two hours before your daughter died, she texted me. She said she was sorry for teasing me and deposited three lakhs into my account. She spoke to you. She left without speaking to me. "Dad..." "When you watch this video, I will not be around." "I will have gone far away from you." "I'm sorry, dad." "I could not be with you in your old age." "You must have taken it very hard." "I need to tell you an important thing." "Vinod Malhotra called me that day." "He said his life as well as ours was in danger." "I did not believe it, then." "But after the accident, I realized it was true." "After I die, you'd think Vinod Malhotra is responsible for this." "But that's not true." "After you watch this video..." "...if someone had killed Vinod Malhotra..." "...that same person must have killed me, too." "You must not slump because I am not here anymore." "If you do..." "...that will be the day I really die." "They'd think you would falter if they killed me." "That must not happen!" "You must stand straight with the same defiance." "Rise up ten times stronger!" "He would even be watching you at this very moment." "Do not leave this city without destroying him." "The back of my head hurts!" "I don't even know what to say!" "I like you very much!" I'm sorry, sir. I heard today is your last day on the job. Come in, sir. Please sit down. Per the protocols, you must not be in uniform. I wear it, fully aware of that! Beat it! For poor physical fitness, a suspension and transfer order is in. If you retire voluntarily, it will be decent. You decide. Resign or retire. I am on duty, sir! Per the Human Rights Commission, this is a court order! That is old news, sir! What I am saying is flash news! The court has given me four days to prove my physical and mental stability. Here is the court order. But the court has allotted only four days. In that time, to get a physical fitness certificate and rejoin the police force... ...is very difficult at your age! Age is merely a number for those who believe in themselves. With you as reference, you say it can't be done. With me as reference, I say it can be done! It is not possible, Aaditya! Accomplishing the impossible is my thing! Prepare for a physical test in four days! "After I die, you'd think Vinod Malhotra is responsible for this." "But that is not true." "After you watch this video..." "...if someone had killed Vinod Malhotra..." "...that same person must have killed me, too." Going by what Valli said, there is a third party involved in this. The grudge between me and Vinod Malhotra was over his son. For killing the boy, why must someone else want to kill me and Vinod Malhotra? Don't raise your hands against me, sir! I broke only his motorbike! It was not yours! -It is my motorbike! I had lent it to him. If you guys had problems, why break my bike? How could I have known that, sir? He gave it to me to use! Inspector Alok Yadav calling from Advocate Banerjee's office! Five years ago, Mr. Malhotra's will left his wealth to only his two daughters. There is no asset in his son's name! Inspector Suraj calling from Maseen Hospital! Per the medical records... ...Mrs. Malhotra had only two girl children, born in 2004 and 2007. It is confirmed she has only two daughters. Everything adds up! Therefore, that boy is not Vinod Malhotra's biological child. We got it! The reappointment letter of Mr. Aaditya Arunasalam. This is the one. Ajay Malhotra. The school and college records of the deceased boy... ...state his date of birth as July 11, 1990. July 11, 1990. July 11, 1990. Get me a list of parents of children born on that date.... ...from every private and government hospital in Mumbai. If someone left his child to be adopted by another... ...then he definitely must be a wanted criminal. Pull that from our criminal database. Cross-reference the list of the names of parents... ...with the list of criminals from 30 years ago, for a match. ADGP speaking, sir! List of wanted criminals from 30 years ago and the corporation birth list... ...have been sent to your desk. Yes, sir. Both data lists are being verified, sir. Hari Chopra! You're dead meat, you mongrel! "The most wanted Indian drug lord and criminal mobster, Hari Chopra..." "The man responsible for the police massacre in Borivali, Mumbai..." "...and a wanted criminal since 1993..." "...by India and other countries, too." "He is being tracked by Mumbai's Commissioner Aaditya Arunasalam..." "...and a manhunt has been initiated to arrest him." "Steven Williams." "Commissioner of the London Metropolitan Police." "I am Sharaban Abdullah." "Secretary General of the Dubai Police Force." "Police Chief from the Republic of China." I am Aaditya Arunasalam. Commissioner of Police. Mumbai, India. "We have been hunting Hari Chopra for sixteen years now." "But we have never been able to arrest him." "We'd like to send a counter terrorist team to hunt him down." "He is the one who brought drugs into our country." "We have been chasing him for the past seven years." "We are ready to come there to put him down!" "We are ready to send our force!" Alright, officers! We will discuss about this and get back to you. Thank You! What do you think about this, Commissioner? Hari Chopra was born in our country. He betrayed his own motherland. 27 years ago, he burned to death, the seventeen cops who tried to arrest him. That made people to lose their respect for the police. Drugs and women trafficking rose! This is between him and our police force! An old score! We must settle it ourselves! Tell them all to just sit back and watch what is about to happen. Are you sure? -100%, sir! Above all that, he burned all those cops on March 12th. Today is March 10th! The day after tomorrow, on the same date, I will end him! Our police force will suffice for me! Good luck! Him? Do what to me? Such overconfidence! No schmuck can ever find my whereabouts! After he cornered Vinod Malhotra and killed my son... ...thinking he had cleaned up all of Mumbai, he slackened. He failed to save his own daughter because of his overconfidence! I will prove again that Mumbai cops are cowards who fear for their lives. I am placing a bounty on the Mumbai Police. Anyone who wants to take a shot, can go ahead. If the killer brings the dead cop's badge and shoulder crest stars... ...they will be paid according to rank. Kill a constable? Get 25 lakh rupees! Head constable? 50 lakh rupees! Let go of him! Let go! Someone help! Sub-inspector or an Inspector? One crore! Anyone above that? Two crores! If they accept the deal, pay them half the money as advance. The cops should fear to even wear their uniforms! Someone call an ambulance! Just a minute, sir. A call for you. I'm sorry. You were not cut off. I broke the phone. He is in Mumbai, sir! Give me a day! I need no foreign police! I will get him myself! I will get him! I will get him! I will not spare him! Once I get him, I will... I'll pick up a knife and stab him all over! Blood! I will kill him so! "Breaking News!" "As cops continue to be killed in Mumbai..." "...many of them did not turn up for work, fearing for their lives." "Many police stations look deserted, with very few cops!" "27 years ago on March 12th, this very day..." "...Hari Chopra burned cops alive in Borivali and got away!" "The police fear today will be another black day." We do not know where he is. Our police force has dwindled too. The families of cops are afraid. As the President said, can we bring over a foreign police force... I will nab him within a day! If other nations want to nab criminals, they can seek our help then. How can it be done in a day? To catch a criminal, we must be more of a criminal than them! Greetings, sir! Sit down! Good afternoon! Here is an interesting incident. In 2005, at the Florida Penitentiary in America... ...there was an unsolved case involving a man named Thomas Grammer. A cop named Tommy Roy solved it with the help of convicts like you. No criminal can either climb up the ranks or do business all by himself. A cop might not know about him. But other criminals will definitely know him! You may recall that I met with an accident last month. Two days before that... Look at this photo! Someone cut the fencing wire at the Indian border and came in here! A vehicle came to pick him up. Here are its tyre tracks. The width of these tyres is 10.4 inches. The gap between the front tyre and the back tyre is 3,119 millimetres. So it had to have been a heavy vehicle. Seats up to eight people. There is a chance you might know one of the other seven people in it. Now, you will each be given a phone. Try calling people you are acquainted with, who do this kind of work. Every number you call, will be recorded in this computer. The computer will relay their mobile's location! Even if the phone is off, we can locate it! All you need to do is call and enquire. If you find even a single clue... ...I will shorten your prison sentence by half. I will increase the time you get to talk to your families. Got it? Got it, sir! Deepak knows about border crossing. -He usually does it! Call him! He is giving out phones to convicts! He is using the Thomas Grammer method! I will handle it. The nineteenth floor is filled with our men! There are not as many cops in Mumbai now! Let him know! -Yes. A foreign car. "Dharavi" Raja must have done it! -No signal! Any leads? Of the numbers they tried, these six have been off for the last 36 days. It matches with the date Hari Chopra came across the border. They have removed the SIM cards. So we cannot find their whereabouts. But thirteen days ago, one of them used the SIM card... ...and spoke to his family for 36 seconds. He called from an old office of the 'Mumbai Media TV' channel. Another thing, sir. The same channel constantly spread false information about you. Who owns the channel? -Just a moment, sir. Pramod Gupta. Pramod Gupta... Check if there has been any police case filed against him. Nothing recent, sir. 48 years ago, at the age of twelve, he was in a juvenile prison for ten months. Who were his cellmates at the time? One second, sir. His cellmate was Hariharan. His third cellmate was one Vinod Pratap. The same Hariharan is now known as Hari Chopra. That means Vinod Pratap... ...is Vinod Malhotra, sir! Jailbirds! So our target is now in the Mumbai Media TV building! You tell him, sir! What is it? The old Mumbai Media TV office has nineteen floors! There would be about a thousand people there. We don't have that many cops! Even if we go with the force we have, many lives will be lost from our side! What do we do? We need a huge team! Else, we will miss this chance! And today is March 12th, sir. If we fail this time too, it would be a humiliation. We are ready, sir! Police is not a job! It is a service! We live to protect! We die to serve! Don't shoot! Where is Hari Chopra? I don't know! Commissioner Aaditya Arunasalam! Mumbai Police! The Black Day. March 12th! You wanted to kill me on this same day, right? I will kill you in that same place! I'm right here! I wanted to escape! But I do not have the heart to leave without killing you! Better than killing a cop, if I kill his family... ...the cop would go crazy! Take you, for instance. Did you not go crazy after your daughter died? In the same manner, every child, woman and elder present here... If I were to burn all of them to death... ...they will be united with those who are already dead, right? I have sent you a photo. Check it out! Come on over, man! Mumbai Police! If I notice from afar even one police vehicle besides yours... ...I will kill them all! If you do not want this to happen, you must come here! The only life I want to end, is yours! Come on, man! I'm coming! I'm coming right away! Listen up! Let all of them go! Do not hurt them. Do whatever you want to me! Let them go! Look! You remember how your daughter died, don’t you? Aware her life would end in two hours... ...she died in sheer agony! The back of my head hurts! You must die the same way too! You must not be killed instantly with just one bullet! Bring it on! Wherever he is, do not spare him, dad! You killed my daughter because I killed your son. But my Valli was a good person! "To the police officers who protect us with their lives."
