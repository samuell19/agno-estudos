AMY? AMY? HELLO? YEAH? HELLO, AMY? SHE'S 9 YEARS OLD. UNITED 93, RUNWAY 22 RIGHT, CLEAR FOR TAKEOFF. UNITED 93, RUNWAY 22 RIGHT, READY FOR TAKEOFF. DO WE KNOW WHERE IT'S HEADED? ANY WORD FROM THE COCKPIT? AMY? YES. I HAVE TO SPEAK VERY FAST. DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHERE YOU'RE HEADED? NO. PEOPLE IN COACH THINK IT'S A ROUTINE EMERGENCY. WE'VE ASKED FOR A DOCTOR, BUT NONE'S ON BOARD. THEY STILL THINK IT'S A HEART ATTACK. CAN YOU TELL US ANYTHING MORE ABOUT THE HIJACKERS? YES. THEY HAVE KNIVES AND MACE. THEY SAY THEY HAVE A BOMB. THEY WERE IN SEATS 3D, 5D, 1A, 3A. WE'RE LOSING ALTITUDE PRETTY RAPIDLY. HOW ARE THE PEOPLE WHO WERE STABBED? ONE FLIGHT ATTENDANT'S OK. I'M NOT SURE. THE OTHER MAY NOT MAKE IT. WE HAVE HER ON OXYGEN. OH, MY GOD! SOMETHING'S WRONG HERE! WHAT'S HAPPENING? AMY, ARE YOU STILL THERE? WE'RE IN RAPID DESCENT. WE'RE ALL OVER THE PLACE. CAN YOU LOOK OUT THE WINDOW AND TELL US WHERE YOU ARE? DO YOU RECOGNIZE ANYTHING? AMY, DO YOU KNOW YOU'RE HEADED TOWARD KENNEDY? I SEE WATER, BUILDINGS. WE'RE FLYING LOW. WE'RE FLYING VERY, VERY LOW.

YOU'RE WELCOME. WE HAVE NEWS OF A TRAGIC EVENT. APPARENTLY, AN AIRPLANE HIT THE WORLD TRADE CENTER AT THE TIP OF MANHATTAN. THERE IT IS. AND YOU'RE LOOKING AT A LIVE PICTURE. THE PLANE HIT ONE OF THE TOWERS NEAR THE TOP OF THE BUILDING. HERE'S ANOTHER PERSPECTIVE. NOW IT LOOKS LIKE... ...DEBRIS ALL OVER, SMOKE IS BILLOWING FROM THE TOP 10 OR SO FLOORS OF THE TOWER. I WOULD ASSUME THAT IT'S BEING EVACUATED. MOM? IN HERE! NOW WE'RE TRYING TO FIND OUT WHAT TYPE OF AIRCRAFT COLLIDED... ...THEIR OFFICES. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT IS RESPONDING TO THIS EVENT, WHICH HAPPENED AROUND 8:45 THIS MORNING, AND WE HAVE SO FAR NOT BEEN ABLE TO OBTAIN WORD ON HOW MANY CASUALTIES WE MAY EXPECT. THE PLANE COULD HAVE BEEN EN ROUTE TO NEWARK OR KENNEDY. AND FOR SOME REASON, IT STRAYED OFF PATH. PLANE'S CIRCLE THIS AREA AS THEY WAIT IN ROTATION TO LAND AT NEWARK. ALTHOUGH, HOW AN AIRCRAFT COULD HIT ONE OF THOSE MASSIVE TOWERS ON SUCH A CLEAR DAY, IT'S VERY HARD TO COMPREHEND. HI, THIS IS MELODY HOMER. I JUST WANTED TO SEND A MESSAGE TO MY HUSBAND, LEROY HOMER, VIA ARCS. HE'S FIRST OFFICER ON FLIGHT 93. UH, 93, OK. UH, THINGS ARE PRETTY HECTIC. THAT FLIGHT IS PROCEEDING NORMALLY, THOUGH. I CAN TAKE YOUR TRANSMISSION NOW. HI, HON. I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE YOU WERE OK. MELODY. NEW YORK TERMINAL. TERMINAL, CAN YOU HELP US TRACK A PLANE THAT'S STRAYED OFF PATH? WE'VE LOST TRANSPONDER. OK, YEAH, I GOT A TARGET THAT KEEPS COASTING. OK, GOT 'EM AGAIN. HE'S OVER STATEN ISLAND. DO YOU KNOW WHO HE IS? NO, HE'S TRACKING TOWARDS MANHATTAN. HE'S MOVING FAST. LOOKS LIKE YOU GOT ANOTHER ONE COMING IN. THE PLANE HIT THE NORTH TOWER OF THE WORLD TRADE... THERE! THERE'S ANOTHER ONE! WE JUST SAW ANOTHER ONE. YES, WE JUST SAW ANOTHER PLANE APPARENTLY GO INTO... ...HITTING THE SOUTH TOWER. THIS IS INCREDIBLE. A HUGE FIREBALL FROM THIS EXPLOSION. THAT WOULD BE THE SECOND... 2 PLANES. THIS RAISES, UM... THIS HAS TO BE DELIBERATE, FOLKS. HERE YOU ARE. WOULD YOU LIKE COFFEE OR TEA? TEA. TEA. WOULD YOU LIKE SOME COFFEE OR TEA? SOME COFFEE WOULD BE GREAT, THANK YOU. SURE. CAN I GET YOU ANYTHING ELSE, SIR? NO, THANK YOU. SOME TEA? THE SECOND PLANE HIT AT 9:03... CAN I HAVE SOME MORE JUICE? THE PEOPLE WERE ALREADY AT THEIR DESKS. WHAT'S THE WORD YOU'RE LOOKING FOR, MADISON? PLEASE? ...THE FIRES SPREADING TO OTHER FLOORS. YOU KNOW, FIGHTING A FIRE... I'M HUNGRY. OH, ALL RIGHT. LET'S GET YOU SOMETHING TO EAT. ...IT'S DIFFICULT TO CONTAIN THE FIRE. THIS IS A HUGE TRAGEDY, ALMOST INCOMPREHENSIBLE. UNDOUBTEDLY, THIS IS TERRORIST RELATED, BUT WE CAN ONLY GUESS AS TO WHO IS BEHIND THIS. IS THAT A FIRE, MOMMY? YES, IT IS. DRINK YOUR JUICE AND DON'T WATCH THE TV, GIRLS. IS IT A MOVIE? NO. IT'S POSSIBLE THEY WERE IN CONTROL. DRINK. THEY MOST LIKELY WOULD HAVE TAKEN OVER THE PLANE ONCE IT WAS IN THE AIR. IT'S A SUNNY, CLEAR DAY, SO VISIBILITY WOULD NOT BE A PROBLEM. I NEED SOME PAPER. GIRLS, WATCH YOUR LITTLE SISTER. I'LL BE BACK IN A MINUTE. THERE'S A MESSAGE FROM YOUR WIFE. IN A MINUTE. WE'RE COMING ON CLEVELAND CENTER. TOMORROW'S MY ANNIVERSARY. NO KIDDING. HOW MANY YEARS?

Reporter, on television: WHAT COMES TO MIND TO ME IS PEARL HARBOR. THE CATASTROPHES HERE, SADLY, COULD BE GREATER. WE... WE CERTAINLY HOPE... UH, AND IN NEW YORK... DEFINITELY GONNA BE A CHALLENGE. UNITED 93, VERIFY YOUR FLIGHT LEVEL AS 3-5-0. UNITED 93, VERIFY YOUR FLIGHT LEVEL AS 3-5-0. Reporter, on television: YOU KNOW, ONE THING THAT I WOULD ASSUME THAT IS BEING CLOSELY WATCHED IS THE POSSIBILITY THAT OTHER PLANES HAVE BEEN HIJACKED. 9-1-1. WHAT IS YOUR EMERGENCY?

THEY ARE ALL BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN COMMERCIAL JETS THAT WERE TAKEN OVER BY HIJACKERS... WHAT SHOULD WE DO, VAUGHN? SHOULD WE CALL THE POLICE? THE POLICE CAN'T FLY, ALICE. THEY HIT THE WORLD TRADE CENTER WITH HIJACKED PLANES, AND THEY JUST GOT THE PENTAGON. LISTEN TO ME, ALICE. YOU'VE GOT TO CALL MARK ON HIS CELL PHONE, ALL RIGHT, AND TELL HIM THIS IS A SUICIDE MISSION. TELL HIM THEY HAVE TO DO WHATEVER THEY CAN TO TRY AND GET CONTROL OF THE PLANE BACK. WE CAN CALL THE POLICE AFTERWARDS. TELL MARK THAT THEY HAVE TO GET THAT PLANE BACK. TELL HIM THIS IS A SUICIDE MISSION. THE CIRCUITS ARE BUSY. TRY AGAIN. OK, YEAH. HE'S TOO SCARED.

WHAT'S THE PRESENT AIR SPEED ON 93? IT'S OVER 450 KNOTS. AT WHAT, 12,000 FEET? THE AIRCRAFT COULD BREAK UP AT THAT SPEED. IT'S POSSIBLE. THIS REALLY IS UNPRECEDENTED. I GUESS YOU COULD GO BACK TO PEARL HARBOR, BUT WE REALLY DON'T KNOW IF IT'S OVER. THIS IS AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT KIND OF ENEMY. HELLO? MOM? IT'S ME, ELIZABETH. HELLO, DARLING. UH, ARE YOU OK? MOM, WE'VE BEEN HIJACKED, AND I'M CALLING TO SAY GOOD-BYE. WH-WHY WOULD YOU WANNA DO THAT? MOM... DO YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON? Reporter, on television: EVACUATING THE PENTAGON IS OF COURSE FAR LESS PROBLEMATIC... NO. ELIZABETH, UM... I HAVE MY ARMS AROUND YOU, AND I AM HOLDING YOU, AND I LOVE YOU. I FEEL YOUR ARMS AROUND ME, AND... I LOVE YOU, TOO. BUT, MOM... WE'RE BEING HIJACKED, AND I'M NOT GONNA COME HOME. ELIZABETH, DARLING, I WANT YOU TO LISTEN TO ME.

UNITED 93, DO YOU STILL HEAR THE CENTER? UNITED 93, DO YOU STILL HEAR CLEVELAND? UNITED 93. UNITED 93, CLEVELAND? DIXIE, FLIGHT'S DOWN. DOWN AS IN LANDED? NEGATIVE. DOWN AS IN SOME FIELD. ROGER THAT. PLANES HAVE BEEN LANDING AT VARIOUS AIRPORTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA, BUT AT THE TIME THE ORDER WAS ISSUED, THERE WERE OVER 4,500 EN ROUTE TO THEIR SCHEDULED DESTINATIONS, AND THERE ARE FLIGHTS THAT THE AIRLINES ARE WORRIED ABOUT, ONE OF WHICH COULD BE HEADING TOWARD WASHINGTON, D.C. WELL, WE WILL KEEP YOU UPDATED ON THE SITUATION AS MORE INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE. IN THE MEANTIME... IS THE PLANE IN THERE? WE DON'T KNOW YET. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WE'RE STILL LOOKING FOR IT. AT FIRST WE THOUGHT IT WAS IN THE HOLE, BUT THERE'S NOTHING IN THERE. IT MUST HAVE LANDED IN THE WOODS, BUT WE HAVEN'T LOCATED IT YET. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A 757, A HUGE AIRPLANE. YEAH, WE KNOW. YOU CAN HELP US LOOK FOR IT IF YOU LIKE. ...MANHATTAN, AND THERE'S THE HORRIFYING POSSIBILITY THAT THE NORTH TOWER WILL FALL AS WELL. EXCUSE ME. WE'RE JUST GETTING THIS WORD IN THAT A FOURTH PLANE HAS CRASHED. IT IS BELIEVED TO BE UNITED FLIGHT 93 THAT WAS EN ROUTE TO SAN FRANCISCO. IT WAS FLYING SOUTHEAST ON A PATH HEADING TOWARD WASHINGTON, D.C. WE DON'T HAVE ANY INFORMATION AS TO THE CAUSE OF THE CRASH, BUT WE WILL KEEP YOU INFORMED... AND THIS WILL BE THE FOURTH PLANE TAKEN OVER BY TERRORISTS. WE DON'T HAVE ANY INFORMATION AS TO THE CAUSE OF THE CRASH, BUT WE'LL KEEP YOU INFORMED. AGAIN, THIS... LISA, RELEASE THE CALL. RELEASE THE CALL, HONEY. HERE'S WHERE WE STAND AT THIS HOUR. 4 PLANES CRASHED... OH... ...AND WASHINGTON, D.C. AS OF YET... ...THAT THIS WILL TAKE A MASSIVE EFFORT THAT WILL TAX THE RESOURCES OF OUR GREATEST CITY, BUT AS YOU KNOW, NEW YORKERS HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO PULL TOGETHER IN TIMES LIKE THIS. THIS CITY WILL REBUILD, AND NO DOUBT NEW TOWERS WILL BE CONSTRUCTED, AND I WOULD ASSUME THERE WILL BE A RESPONSE, A MILITARY RESPONSE. YOU CAN SEE PEOPLE COVERED IN DUST AND DEBRIS LEAVING THE AREA. THE SCALE OF THE BUILDINGS... SMOKE INHALATION HAS BEEN WIDESPREAD, AS SEVERAL SQUARE BLOCKS... THE PLANE MUST HAVE IMPACTED AT SUCH A SPEED THAT IT RESULTED IN AN EXPLOSION SO INTENSE... THE ENTIRE AREA, OF COURSE, IS BEING SEARCHED FOR EVIDENCE AS WELL AS FOR THE VOICE RECORDER. ...OVER THERE.
