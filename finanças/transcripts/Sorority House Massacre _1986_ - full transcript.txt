(suspenseful music) Hi, Mrs. Lawrence. Oh, dear. What happened? It must have all started... the moment I entered the house. (ominous music) (footsteps approaching) (doorbell ringing) Hi. (man screaming) [Man] You! What is it? Nothing. I was getting worried about you. How have you been? Just okay. It takes a while. You can have Connie, Robin, and Wendy's room. - Hi, Beth. - Hi, Trace. They all took off early. Okay. Well, it'll be good to be around you guys, I've been kind of lonely. Well, if you need anything, I'm at the end of the hall. Thanks. And you'll see, after a weekend with us, you're gonna wanna join this sorority. Jesus Christ. Did you see the look on that mother's face? Should we have taped him up like that? You wanna listen to him all night? No, maybe we should call Dr. Lindsey. No, let the lady sleep. She'll be here in the morning. (leather creaking) (clock ticking) (foreboding music) Where are you going? In there. In the house? Yes. Be careful. (eerie music) (blood splattering) (glass shattering) (child moaning) Hey, Con? Oops. Well, you're Beth, right? Right. Hi, I'm Sara. Hi. Oh, how'd you do that? I don't know. I've had it since before I can remember. Mmm. You wouldn't happen to have a sweater to go with this, would you? Mm-mm. Me neither, oh well. Cindy, can I please, please, please borrow your pink jacket? Not a chance. How's this? Thanks Linda, you saved my life. Sure. Have you seen my black boots? Tracy's got 'em. Trace? Cindy's going to Palm Springs. So? So, her Memorial Day weekend's gonna be a little more memorable than ours. What's the emergency? My boots, please. Say, Linda. Go ahead. Steve's going rafting this weekend. Well, invite him here. I did, he's going rafting. He's the slug. Hey, Beth. Ready for some major fun this weekend? Yeah, I could use it. (leather creaking) (metal clasps rattling) What's with Beth? God, talk about glum. Shh, her aunt died. But that was weeks ago. God Tracy, get sensitive. Her aunt raised her, it's like her mom died. Oh, well I didn't know. Well, I've got a nine o'clock. Great, we can all walk together. First thing tomorrow we have to call the rental house. I already arranged everything. What? You actually care about setting up the pow-wow? The sooner we set it up, the sooner it's out of the way. That's the old sorority spirit. Oh, shit. What? I got the wrong book, you guys go on ahead. No, we'll wait. (ominous music) (knife slicing) Beth? Come on, we gotta go! Beth? Are you okay? I, I don't know. What happened? I saw this horrible guy. Hey take it easy, there's no guy here. If there were, Tracy would've found him. (fists pounding) When did he become agitated? Late last night. Said they had to strap him in. I wonder what triggered it. (hands slapping) I mean, too chic. My mom made me promise to wear it after those muggings last month. Did you guys hear the story about the pet pig? Ew, who'd want a pet pig? A family moved from Dayton to Miami, got it? From Ohio to Florida, and this pig found its way back to them. So now they have to move again. It's like it picked up on a psychic beacon. Or in this case a psychic bacon. Mrs. Lawrence stopped by. What's she doing? She's going with her boyfriend. Really? (girls laughing) Oh, yeah. (girls laughing) Oh, come on, you guys, it's so meaningless. You guys, I gotta go, I'm late. Bye. Okay, see you, bye. I'll see you later. Okay, I'll see you at the house later. Is he okay? I don't know what his problem is, but he wants out bad. What does he think's out there? I need a sedative. Coming right up. Okay, people, books under your desks, here we go. Compare, contrast, and comment on the differences and similarities in theory and in therapeutic practice between traditional psychoanalysis and behavior modifications. Great, a pop psychology quiz. (projector whirring) [Man] Death. It comes to all of us. Yet how often do we consider our own mortality? Too frequently we're caught up in daily matters of the self to face this aspect. Everyone in here has probably experienced deja vu or clairvoyancy, the strong feeling that you've been in the same situation before or that you know exactly what's going to happen. In Back to Brazil, Freedinland uses foreshadowing and repetition to recreate these feelings in the reader. (eerie music) (gasping) Let's talk about how she uses this. [Student] Well, uh, isn't Freedinland trying to, uh. He didn't even touch the most interesting stuff. You'll like this. Some studies show the brain waves can be transmitted and received like light and sound waves. Really? The actual brain waves? Yeah, they did this really neat experiment where they took a mother cat and separated her from her kittens by hundreds of miles. Then when they killed the kittens-- They killed the kittens? The mother cat cried at the exact moment that each kitten died. She knew what was happening by brain wave. Now admit it, that's amazing. Forget amazing. It's cruel, that's really horrible Andy. It's okay, Sara. It is not, talk about reptilian behavior. Ready to do a little mind reading? You sure you wanna know what this guy's thinkin'? Okay. Let's find out what's bothering you. One down, three to go. Oh, well thank you very much. You could be over here helping us. Come on everybody, let's go! Somebody's tennis racket. Okay hurry up. Goodbye, Mrs. Lawrence, have a nice weekend. Oh thanks honey, you girls have a good time too. Oh, remember to keep the doors locked, and remind Linda, she always forgets. There's a spare key in the basement if you need one and I left my hotel number on the fridge. Okay. Was it something that... Hold it, something's wrong, I'm getting a high incidence of theta waves. No he frequently reads theta. What do you mean, he walks around half asleep half awake all the time? Now you know why I'm so interested in what happened last night. Was it something here at the hospital? Something you dreamt? Was it a person in your dream? Someone you know? Laura. Since when is he verbal? Since this minute. (foreboding music) Who are you? (screaming) Give me another five milligrams. (screaming) What is it? I didn't expect you. Obviously not. I left my directions. Beth, honey, try to relax. Yes, sorry. Well I guess that's all for today. Maybe a couple of days. (eerie music) (doorbell ringing) Hey we forgot our keys. Alright, the whole place to ourselves. Let's eat Melanie's ice cream. Oh god, do you know what I've always wanted to do? I mean like if time stopped for everyone except me? Try on Cindy's clothes. Yes! Come on, Beth, this is a once in a lifetime. (upbeat jazzy music) Alright, pink's my color. And the purple one. (girls laughing) We got robbed. God, how can she afford all these? I mean I'm into excess as much as the next person, but come on. Tracy, her allowance is more than my parents' combined income. What's the matter, Beth? Too old for dress up? Are you okay? I'm sorry I'm so out of it, I just can't get this dream out of my head. Well I know a lot about dreams, tell me about it. (keys jangling) (foreboding music) And everywhere I looked, I found blood. I felt like there was somebody there, only I couldn't see him. And then all of the sudden he started attacking me. Whoa. Beth, that's creepy. I know, it's really scary. Okay, the first thing to realize is it is just a dream, it's nothing to be afraid of. Dreams are only your subconscious' way of talking to you. Uh, Beth, if your subconscious asks for me, I'm not here okay? You know I have a book that explains dream symbols, I'll get it and we'll crack this baby. Oh shit, Cindy's gonna kill me. (suspenseful music) What'll it be? What goes with analysis? Gin, very introspective, martinis for your New York 40's, tonics for the unions among us, tap for the behavioralists. Make mine gin tonic. Martini over here. Better give me one of each. (suspenseful music) (glass shattering) Hey what are you doing there? Okay, dolls, frequently represent childhood. Well that was easy. Dolls equal childhood, for this you need your book? Wait, Beth said they seemed alive, living dolls, that's us right? Hey I would appreciate it if you people would stop trampling all over my major. Dream imagery is a really personal thing, you can't figure it out with books like that. Now the fancy table setup. I bet that's the party. I'll go for that, this says it's family or social situations. But that can't be right. I'm not terrified of planning a party. What does a guy with a knife mean? Means you're weird, girl. Look, the guy probably represents the opposite sex. There's nothing specific you recognize about him right? Right. And the knife's obviously fear, which would tie in with the bloody catcher's mitt. Fright associated with a male object. Male object is right, the knife is a phallic symbol. Uh oh Beth, spilled your innermost beans here. Scared of sex? Not that I know of. What do marbles mean? It means that you're losing yours. (car horn honking) Alright, Tracy rented some men. Hey where do you want this stuff? In the back. I told you I'd taken care of things. (eerie music) Hey, that's my car, stop. I don't think Mrs. Lawrence is gonna be too keen on all this junk, Tracy. But it'll be fun, I am sick and tired of the same old circle of chairs. It's time to put some wow in the pow-wow. (unsettling music) (screaming) Hi. Hey. What are you guys doing here? Oh you know us, always up for a little teepee party. Fine, then we'll put you to work. Whoa what is all this stuff? Oh, Tracy went theme happy, must be all that firewater. Craig and I will go inside and hold it steady. Right. (clapping) Funny guys, you're a regular laugh and a half. Come on you guys, let's finish this later. Yeah I gotta take off. But you're gonna stay right? Sure, I gotta work later tonight. You could stay here this weekend, Steve. Yeah but I wanna go rafting. A slug, a major slug. I'll see you next weekend. Maybe, maybe not. Attention, we have a missing and dangerous patient. Ward personnel, locate and subdue patient Robert Henkel, I repeat we are missing patient Henkel. Great, just great. Fix the lights, guys. [Craig] What are you talkin' about? You know, lights, fusebox, immature goofballs. We didn't do anything. Honest. Okay, if you're that desperate to have us in the dark. (evil laughing) This is it. And he's still missing? If you ask me, he's not missing, he's gone. You know, over the fence. Description. I'd say he's six foot, 190 pounds, blue eyes, real pale fucker, mean as hell right now. What's the background on him? Don't have it, have to call the doctor in charge. Wait a minute, are you saying this is a haunted house? Well think about it, I mean what makes a house haunted? It's when a bad thing happens, and you can't do much worse than this guy did. I read somewhere that ghosts are just people's psychic energy that stays in a place. Uh oh, somewhere someone's killing kittens, I can feel it. Andy! So what exactly did this guy do? (suspenseful music) And then he took a pick axe and he crept up on his mom and dad as they watched TV in this very room. And bam! He let them have it. Then he took his father's hunting knife and he went hunting. No, don't. [Tracy] Yeah John, that's enough. [John] You okay? It's horrible. Well yeah, that's the point. Go on, John, I like being spooked. I'll stop if it's really scaring you. No it's okay, you guys go on. I'm not feeling so great, I'm gonna go upstairs. Okay, then what? Then he went to where his little sisters lay asleep and one by one, room by room he murdered his entire family. That's one solution. Jeez, when was this? How long has this been the theta house? About 12 years. Then it was 13 or 14 years ago. They were the last family to live and die here before the sorority bought the place. Right. Look, it happens to be true. Nice try, John, but I've heard that about every house on the row. Come on, let's catch some tube. (ominous music) (light switch flicking) Oh, thanks guys. Jesus John, what are you doing? I just wanted to make sure that you were alright. Well I will be if you stop scaring me to death. I'm sorry, I mean I couldn't see you. Look, I think I'm gonna call it a night. You sure? What room are you in? Well I was in that one, but I'm not sleeping there again. Well, goodnight. Goodnight. Some date, huh? I'm sorry I wasn't much fun tonight. It's okay with me, Beth. I mean I just like being around you. You son of a bitch. Oh so the scaremeister himself gets the willies? Don't be a jerk, Andy. Oh come on, I was just kidding. Man fuck you if you can't take a joke. Let us lighten up, shall we? I mean we're here to have fun, right? Hey you guys, catch this. I don't know, she should be home by now. Oh wait, hold on. [Dr. Lindsey] This is Dr. Karen Lindsey, please leave your message after the tone, thanks. (answering machine beeping) Dr. Lindsey, this is Larry over at the hospital. Please call in as soon as you get this. Robert Henkel has escaped. Don't your doctors have beepers? Here? You gotta be kidding. (ominous music) [Man] Laura? John? (screaming) Same kind of dream? The same dream. I mean, more of the same dream. Uh, Beth, do you always have nightmares like this? Cause one thing about being in a sorority is, you know, other people have to sleep. I don't get it, I've never had bad dreams. Something really awful must be going on inside my head. Maybe it's being in all these strange rooms. You should stay with Sara and me tonight. Thanks, but I don't feel much like sleep right now. And can we please do something about the lights, Craig? What do you mean? Oh I'll do it, god Craig enough's enough. (foreboding music) (switch clacking) Craig! Shit, what a creepy thing to do. I'm sorry. Boy am I sorry. Well I wouldn't have done that if I'd known it was you. I just wanted to tell you my great idea for tonight. What? Let's spend the night in the teepee. Remember the teepee? Okay, but it's not up. Don't worry baby, I can get it up. Craig! (unsettling music) So what's this dream all about? Oh we should warn you John, Beth has this morbid fear of sex. Tracy. I tell you guys I really think this dream means something serious. What happened this time? He killed somebody else. [John] What? It's so strange, in my dream I'm in this house except everything's different. Then there's that guy, only this time I felt like I knew him, so I wasn't afraid. And then he started killing someone and all of a sudden I knew I was next. Oh god, I'm awake now, I know I'm awake but I still feel like he's coming for me. It's okay, Beth, we're all here. Nothing's gonna happen. But something's already happened. It's like he's already here. When John was telling his story, I looked over the-- (sinister music) He's hiding it. Who's hiding what? The knife, he put it in the fireplace. I hope he wore gloves. It's still there. Oh please, and where did he bury the gold? Let's check it out. Come on Craig, you don't believe this shit. (eerie music) Oh yeah, now this is fun. It's that one. [Sara] Alright. Ah ah ah! Why's it dirty? That's blood. Or dirt. Beth's right, that's dried blood. Oh yuck. Beth, do you know what this means? I know what it means, it means you guys put on one hell of a show. Maybe we should try it on the whole house on Halloween. We didn't plan this. Uh huh, right. Well I think Beth's psychic, and I think it's neat. Maybe we are the haunted sorority house after all. No way, Sara. What are you doing? Oh come on, it hardly belongs on the mantle of achievement. (answering machine rewinding) [Larry] Dr. Lindsey, this is Larry over at the hospital. Please call in as soon as you get this, Robert Henkel has escaped. Okay I have his file. [Dr. Lindsey] There should be an address for his aunt, a Mrs. Jarvis I think. Sweet jesus. [Dr. Lindsey] The first picture? Yeah. That's when I picked him up. The police should know his history. What did he do? Murdered five members of his family, only one little girl survived. She lives with the aunt, he may be headed there. His scars. I think he heard something terrible, something he felt he couldn't silence any other way, not even by killing. This guy is really sick. [Dr. Lindsey] You share the court's opinion. Found the address. I'll get this to Detective Gilbert. Tell him to get over there right away, this girl's in real danger. Gotcha. Beth, there's something we could try to figure out what's bothering you. What? Hypnosis. [Tracy] Ooh. There's nothing ooh about it, Tracy. It's common practice for getting at hidden or repressed feelings. I've done it before, I know what I'm doing. Alright, let's try it. Okay look up at the ceiling. Now pick a spot and concentrate on it. Now breathe deep and relax, let your whole body relax. That's not how it's done. Holy shit am I gonna get it. You really have to go? I really really have to go. I wish you could stay. Me too, but hey, people need their cookies. Call me first thing tomorrow? I will. (eerie music) Hey who are you? What's the plan here buddy? You gotta get a freezer to be... Can you hear me? Yes. Okay, you're back in your dream now. No. What is it? I don't wanna be here. Okay, stay calm you're alright. Let's go further back, back to the place the dream comes from. Okay, where are you? In the house. [Linda] In this house? My house. [Linda] What's happening? Bobby's hurting everyone. Who's Bobby? My brother. [Linda] Is Bobby hurting you? No, 'cause I'm in the basement. But he wants to hurt me. [Linda] Why? I don't know. Beth, how old are you? Beth? I'm five, but I'm... Laura? [Beth] No, he's coming. He knows where I am. Hey, it's alright, when you wake up you'll be safe here with us, and you'll wake up on the count of three. One two three. [Beth] Please hurry. [Linda] Beth! Please help me. [Linda] One two three. [Beth] Please help me. One two three. One two three! Beth, you're awake. (screaming) Oh god. What is it, am I crazy? You're okay now. What happened? It was pretty strange, but it could mean a couple of things. Easy, Beth, I think you're obsessed with that stupid ghost story. Or maybe there was some trauma back when you were little that's coming up now. But why now? Why did it start when I came here? What happened when you were five years old? I don't remember anything. Nothing? Well, what do you remember from when you were five? I see what you mean. I remember lime jello. You know what I think? I think you just had a past life experience. I think you're remembering something that happened before you were you. Sorry Sara, I don't believe in that stuff. Neither do I. Well whatever it is, it's too weird for words. Psst. I gotta go, goodnight all. For some of us. Yeah, I guess the bachelorette's club reconvenes in our room. Yeah I am pretty zonked. Coming soon, Beth? I wouldn't count on it. (suspenseful music) Do you think this place could be haunted? I think you're haunted. Maybe I am. What's the matter? Shh. Hear something? I guess not. (screaming) (cloth ripping) Did you hear that? What, the TV? It sounded like shrieking outside. Probably just Tracy's reaction to Craig's tomahawk. (shrieking) Oh god. Oh god, Craig. Susan. Tracy? John, Sara! God Craig, you're bleeding. What is it? Some guy just killed Tracy. What? He cut the line. You'd better not be joking. This is for real you guys, I swear it's for real. We gotta get through to the police. Cindy's room, she's got her own line. Come on, come on. It's ringing. It stopped. He cut it. Craig, what the hell is going on? Who is it? I don't know, but I think he's after all of us. (foreboding music) (whispered sounds) [Bobby] Laura. Laura. Sara! John! They would have heard us. He got them. No! Linda, Sara! Call the police. We can't. That guy just killed John. He killed John and it's my fault. What do you mean? He was trying to kill me. (bashing on door) He went away. Or he's waiting. Help me with this. Oh god, Craig. I'm okay. Where's Tracy? Son of a bitch killed her. That should keep him out. What if it doesn't? We've got this. My mom sent it after that rape on campus last year. That's great but we've still gotta get help. Can't do that without leaving this room. Maybe he'll go away. The window. I don't know. Beth's right, it's the best way out. Stick together and run like hell. It'll be kinda hard to run if we all break our legs. Help! Help! Help! Can't anybody hear us? (glass shattering) They'll hear that. If anybody's home. Oh shit, where's my brain? We have a fire ladder. From mom. Wait, he's gone. We can go out the front. He's still out there, I can hear him breathing. Wait til I get to the bottom so I can hold it steady. Okay, come on. (heart beating) Hurry! Craig, hold it still. Better. Oh shit. Oh god Linda, hurry. Hurry! No! No! No, no! (screaming) He's dead, right? I think he's dead. I don't think so. Well dead or not, the important thing is that he's down there and now we have to get the hell out of here. (eerie music) (screaming) Oh no, oh Andy. He's dead. Oh god he's back out front. Oh god what are we gonna do? (glass shattering) (window breaking) That's him. That's him, that's the guy from my dream! Kitchen, come on. (screaming) No! Can't we get around him? He'll get one of us. There's no way out back here. Bobby. God he's staring at me. Janet? Why is he staring at me? Shh, don't freak out. Oh god, he's after me. Get back. Janet. Oh god you guys. Run! (screaming) Where's the key? Oh god. Upstairs. No, basement. God, what now? We gotta get out of this house. (police sirens approaching) Wait, do you hear that? It's the police. They're not coming here, how could they know about us? Somebody must have heard us yelling. I don't think so. (footsteps approaching) We can't count on anybody coming for us. We're dead. No! That's why he's here, you know, to kill us. But why? Because John's story was true and this is the guy, he's doing it again. That's why he was saying all those names. But we're not his family, we're not his sisters. I think I am. What? He called me Laura. But your name's Beth. My middle name is Beth, my first name is Laura. Oh god. I think I lived here. I think he tried to kill me before. And how could he know that you'd be here? The same way I knew he was coming. There's something connecting him to what happened here. There is something connecting him to me. (phone ringing) Hello? Dr. Lindsey, Detective Gilbert. About that Jarvis address, the LAPD say no sign of Robert Henkel or anyone else there. Any other ideas where he might go? No, he wouldn't know where else she'd be. I see, well if anything comes to mind. Wait a minute. Yes? He wouldn't know the girl lived with her aunt. He'd go to the old house, the house where he committed the murders. What did you do? I went in there. I guess I was a lot smaller. We're stuck. Oh shit, the spare. Mrs. Lawrence said there was a spare key in here. (suspenseful music) Now look, we are gonna go up there through the front door no matter what happens. But we're gonna need weapons. We'd better be prepared to fight. I wouldn't mind giving that creep a whack with this. (screaming) Oh god, we can't hold him. Are you ready to run? Ready. Wait, wait! He's aiming at us. Wait. Okay, now! Focus on the lock. Cathy, no! [Linda] Get him! Linda? (screaming) The hoe, get the hoe. He's dead. Oh god. You saved my life. Let's just get out of here, come with me. Oh god, oh jesus. I'll get to a phone. Not coming, too late. Please, please don't move, I'll go. Listen. (sirens approaching) Oh no. They're coming, hold on they are coming. Linda? Please god no, Linda? Laura. I'm not Laura anymore, you son of a bitch. (police radio squawking) I'll radio homicide. Help me over here, this girl's still alive. How do they look? Pretty good, Beth, in a couple of months, you'll hardly be able to see them. I wish my memories would fade as fast. You still having those dreams? Well be sure to tell Dr. Lyons about that this afternoon. I will. And try to get some rest. Beth. (screaming) (ominous music)
