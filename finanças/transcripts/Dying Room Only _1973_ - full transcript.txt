You must have seen where my husband went. Are you telling me I did? He was sitting right there, at that table. Right there. And I was right there, at that griddle, with my back turned. How would I know where he went? Maybe he got sore at you and just lit out. Cause your husband ain't here, ain't no fault of mine. You sure he wasn't in the men's room? Ma'am I got no cause to lie to you. Are there side door? Side door? No. There's mouse-hole over corner. Are there back door? Lady, you just come in the only door there is. Well, he has to be somewhere. Ain't in there. Well I'm sorry, he didn't just disappear. Bob! Bob! Why is this door locked? Because I locked it. It supposed to be locked. Will you unlock it please? Out of order, lady. You unlock that door or I'll call the police. You'll do what? Jim! Jim! Come on now. Jim, why don't you just open that door... - What for? - Well... I don't know, maybe she wants to see if it's difference with girls room. - Oh, stop being funny, Tom! - Okay, come on now. Unlock it. Come on. I don't think that lady's gonna believe us till you do. Go on. You've been yelling to me about how much you wanted to look in there, go on! Happy? Wait a second. I wanna look again. There ain't nothing to look at, lady. That old door ain't being used for years. Doesn't it open? What's on the other side? Does it open from the outside? It opens on a... shed. Hadn't been used... It's full of trash. - I'll show to you, if you want me to. - Oh sure you will. You wanna see? She's some kind of jackrabbit, ain't she? Would I have some change, please? I'm sorry, I'm fresh out. Could I have change one dollar, please? Shit! I just put my last dime in this machine. Could I have some change, please? I told you I don't have it. Please! Can I have some change?! You stop beating on that thing, you hear me?! You get out of my place and you stay out. Hey, Jim! Why don't you give her some? I'm 'bout out! Jim! Now, if she wants to call the law she's gonna do it here or somewhere else. May as well be now. We don't want anybody'd say we didn't do everything we could for this little lady. Damn!

Could you get me the police, please? Oh, would you get me the police, please? - It's your dime. - Thank you. Thank you. Yes. Yes, thank you very... Yes, the... With the sheriff's office will be fine. Thank you. Could you come out...? Oh, yes. This is... Is the sheriff there? Hello. Could... Could you come out... Ecuse me. Just a minute. Could you please tell me the name of this cafe? Well, I'm trying to find out the... the name of the cafe where I am. See, I came here with my husband and... he's gone. Oh well... I'm out here. Oh I know, it's the... Arroyo Motel. A, R, R... Yes. Yes, thank you. Thank you. Ma'am... It looks like Jim was right. Yout husband is right now... Bob! Bob! Bob! Bob! Bob! - You're the lady that called? - Yes. What's the problem? My husband's disappeared. Where is your car? Is your car still here? No. Well why don't you think he just didn't drive away? He wouldn't do that. All right ma'am. Well what happened? Well, we came here just drive by for a sandwich, and I went to ladies room for a few minutes to wash up, when I came out my husband wasn't at the table anymore, so I thought he'd gone in the washroom also. Well couldn't he just come out to the car? No, I looked there. I looked everywhere when they told me he wasn't in the washroom. I even looked in that little office over there. Did you check the washroom? Yes, I looked there. Oh where were you when the car drove off? Well I was in the cafe calling your office. Well then you didn't actually see who drove the car away. Let's go inside, ma'am. Sheriff, there's something very wrong here. My husband wouldn't just drive away and leave me. And if he was in the car, he would have been forced. Did you see the car drive away at all? Yes, it just started down the road. Well did it look like there was more than one person in the car? No, but... Hey, fellas. - Big John! - Hello, Johnny. What's going on here? Oh, there ain't nothing going on, Johnny. Well did this lady come in here with her husband a while ago? She came in here with some man. I never saw their marriage licence. Hey, hey, hey, Jim, come on! Now you want me to be nice to her? She brings you in here putting me on the spot. Ain't nothing going on here, sheriff, except the man lightin' out on his wife. That's not true. All right there, just a minute. Did you... Did you see him getting in his car? Oh, sure I did. How else could I tell you, I saw him when he lit out. Do you feel like a beer or anything, John? No, Jim, thanx, no, I don't. Where were you when he started to drive off? I was... uh standing on the porch, right there. And he walked right by you? Sure did. Got in his car, drove away. No. How did he look? I mean, angry or what? It was getting dark. I couldn't see his face. But you're sure it was him? Well sure, I could see his clothes. He's lying! You're lying! He's lying. You didn't actually see him go into washroom. What that has to do with anything? Well ma'am, I'm just trying to find out what happened and I would be really appreciate if you just try to help me. There is another door in that washroom. They said it hadn't been opened for years, but I know they're lying. Because if you didn't see him go into washroom, and you only saw one person drive away in the car... Well, I haven't what to go on, do I? What about that door? That door hasn't been used in years, Johnny. All right, Jim, it's that she's upset. I know she's upset, and ain't no fault of mine. Well now I didn't say it was. All right, we'll take a look. Can't open that, it's locked. The door is locked. It was locked before you got here. Well if it was locked, how did your husband get in there in the first place? No, it was open when my husband... got here. This man went in there. I asked him to go in there first. I thought my husband might... might be ill. And he went in there, and he was staying a long time too. If he went in there... It's took a long time. Why didn't you come out if you knew he wasn't in there? Why didn't you come out? Tell me, if he wasn't in there. Sheriff, she asked me to go in there, and I did, and I took a look and I came out... God, my! She's making this up, that I just don't... I can't believe... Hey! Ma'am! Ma'am! Ma'am! Come on! Wait a minute! Wait... Don't! Come on. Take it easy. Take it easy now. He's lying. Oh, I will find out. What is behind that door, Jim? Same old shed, it's been back there for years, Johnny. Do you wanna open the door for me? Oh, for crying out loud... Jim, do you wanna open that door for me? I swear, you will see that... What do you laughing at? The shed door's both are opening on the... other side. He'd got a way to throw all that trush and junk. Here, I'll hold them open for you. How there? God, just don't like in here, that... And that door was locked before? Absolutely. I... I just unlocked it, so you come in and take a look, if you wanted to, Johnny. It's I told her I keep it locked. That sink don't work. And the door was open, when she and her husband came here. Yeah, I come in here to get the can of a detergent. I forgot to lock it when I went out. That was all. OK, Jim. Hope you're satisfied. Aren't you going to look inside? Oh, ma'am, you just saw the door was bolted on the other side. There's no way your husband could get through there. Somebody else could have opened it. Ma'am, I... You refuse to even consider it? Jim and I don't want to hear it, sheriff. Sure, if you buy her, in the office, of course. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Mrs. Mitchell. How about if we step outside? Is this all you're going to do? Ma'am, there's not a lot I can do right now. Been trying very hard to make you feel my... Satisfied? All right, Jim. All right. What are you gonna do about it? Ma'am, the only thing I can do is radio word of description of your car and we have it stopped. What about my husband? Till I get more information I can't do a... But he didn't leave me. Until we stop the car we don't really know that. Do we? Yeah, it's a 1973 Chevy Station Wagon, colour bronze. It's registered to Robert Arthur Mitchell and Jean Marie Mitchell, 1343 Josephine Street, Los Angeles, California. Zip is 90048. Mrs. Mitchell doesn't recall the licence plate number, but she thinks the last three letters are: ORE, Oscar-Roger-Echo. Repeat that please. Over. Missing vehicle, 1973, Chevy Station Wagon, colour bronze. Last three numbers of licence sequence O-R-E. Radio Callville, I haven't checked the westbound traffic, in case the driver reverse directions. 10-4. Right. See you later. You... you wanna wait down at the station? Mrs. Mitchell? You wanna wait down at the station? No. Well what you gonna do? I stay here. Would you like me to get you a room here? No, I... I'll wait in the cafe. Ma'am, I think you better have a room. It might be quite a while before we know anything. Jim? Yeah, Johnny? Well could I ask Vi to give Mrs. Mitchell a room? What? She wants a place to stay until we get find out what happened to her husband. What... I don't want her here! She can't stay here! Jim, I want her to have a place to stay. Do you mind? That woman's being nothing but trouble, Johnny! All right, all right. Take it easy. She's used to be right here. Vi? - Hey, how are you, Johnny. - Hey, I'm all right. Can you let this lady have a room to waiting? Wait? Well yeah. Didn't Jim tell you what happened? No. Well, this lady's husband has disappeared. Tom King says he drove off in her car, but the lady doesn't think so, and... I've got a call in to have the car stopped to check it out, but that may take quite a while, and the lady wants to wait here, till we... you know, see what we find out and... You got a room she could set in while she waits? Oh, sure. I want to pay for the room. How much is it? I don't think you have to pay anything. Doesn't she? How much is it, please? Four dollars. Well you're all set, I'm gonna run, Mrs. Mitchell, and I'll come back and tell you anything we find out as soon as we know something. Oh, that'll be a room one. It's right next door. I do like to speak with you, sheriff, before you go. Certainly. Keep an eye on her, will you? She's a little bit... upset. Sure. See you later. All right, ma'am, what is it? Would you please check those rooms? Ma'am, I can't do that. I have no cause. Then find one. I know my husband didn't leave here. Ma'am, I hate to contradict you, but you don't know that. And I don't know that. I can't search this place without a reason. I'm sorry, Mrs. Mitchell. I'll be back soon. Yes? I'd like to call the FBI please. FBI? The Federal Biuro of Investigation. No, there aint no The Federal Biuro of Investigation right here, Mrs. Well, I'd like to call the nearest city that has one. It's after five o'clock, it may be closed. I'm sure they'll take my call. Well, I don't think so. Well, would you try, please? All right, nevernind. I'd like to call Los Angeles, area code 2132754699. Oh, what was the number? 275-46-99. and the 9...? 5-4-6-9-9.

Tell them to get down here right away. OK, sheriff. Walker Pass? Where will they take him? Well, there's an old pumphouse off the road a couple of miles, that doesn't get used much. They may have taken him there. Why? I don't know, Mrs. Mitchell. Did your husband... move, when you saw him? I mean, was he...? He was alive. He's alive. Yes, ma'am They tried to catch me too. Who? Oh, that Jim and that other guy. Tom? Yeah, he was there too. I hit him with a... with a piece of wood. I hope I killed him. - Tom, what is it? What's going on? - I'm going. Go over there! Do you still believe what they told you about my husband? No, ma'am. Oh, if you believe me now? Oh, for one thing, ma'am, your car wasn't spotted. Couldn't find it. That's why I came back to check out the rooms. If you believe me, why didn't you check out the rooms when I asked you to? I'm sorry, Mrs. Mitchell, it seemed at a time. I wasn't sure that your husband hadn't just run out of you. Mrs. Mitchell, I've seen that kind of thing happened a hundred times. Tell me about the other man you saw. What did he look like? It was too dark. He was hulky. He was tall. He walked with a limp? You know who it was? Lou McDermott. He used to work for Cutler. He jumped his parol about six months ago. How far is it? It's... Should be just a little ways now. What if they aren't there? Well then we'll get them on the road. There're only two ways out of here, this road and the cut-off. What would they want?
