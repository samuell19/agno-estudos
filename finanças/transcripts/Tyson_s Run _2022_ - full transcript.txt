I'm sorry, Tyson, I'm lost. And how do I teach you something I don't even understand myself? Well, maybe I can learn, and then you can learn from me. How about we take a break and have some lemonade? Yes, a break and some lemonade. - I'd like some lemonade. - Great. May I remind you, football players, that the State Championship is three months away, and you are not gonna win it by runnin' like a bunch of bench warmers! Now, line it up! We're goin' again! Hey, Mr. Kidman, whoever crosses that goal line last, is off the team! Now, you're their leader, you gonna lead 'em! Yes, sir, Coach, I got you. All right, let's go, folks. It's about trust, hard work, dedication. If we can incorporate those principles into our practices every day and out there on the field, I fully expect we'll be the last team standing at the end of this season. With a record seven undefeated seasons and five state championship titles in a row, Coach Bobby Hollerman is the winningest high school football coach in state history. In other sports-related news, it's official, Stand bridge City is getting a sanctioned marathon. Here's what our mayor had to say about the announcement. Mayor, why a marathon? There are those who surmise this is simply an election stunt at the taxpayers' expense. So, I ask you, is this pure, political spectacle, or a genuine sporting spectacular? Hosting an AIMS-sanctioned international invitational marathon will help put our great city on the map and make it even greater. Here we are, Atlanta. Movin' through our Thursday, nothing but sunshine in store for the forecast. We have a few clouds early this morning, however, those will burn off by the afternoon, and we are left with sunny skies and a high of 73 degrees. Friday through Sunday... Hey, Tyson. ...warming trend, with highs, something up to 81 degrees, and then Monday, sunshine all day. - Tyson. - Yes, Mom? Your father's home. He said "hello" to you. Hello, Father. Hi, honey. Hi. Follow us on social media... How was practice? It was fine. Dinner will be ready by the time you finish your shower. Okay. Sweetie, dinner as soon as your father's done with his shower. - Tyson? - Yes, Mom. Dinner as soon as my father is done with his shower. Thank you for this food we are about to receive. Amen. Tyson, why don't you ask your father how his day was? Okay, Mom. How was your day today, Father? Was it fine? My day was fine, except for algebra. Do they have algebra at your school, Father? Yes, Tyson. Then maybe, I can start going to your school, if they have algebra. Your mother home schools you, Tyson. Yes, my mother home schools me, but she can't teach me what she doesn't understand. And she doesn't understand algebra. It confused her. So, I studied it on my own today, and one of my answers was incorrect. If I go to your school, I can learn algebra, and then teach my mother, and I could see you at your school, teaching football. Coaching. I coach football. Yes, that's right, you coach football. "Coach," a noun, an instructor or trainer in sport. "Coach," a verb, to teach or supervise someone. To act as a trainer as in sports. To coach an athlete or an athletic team. I could learn algebra at your school and I could see you at your school coaching football. Didn't it ever occur to you that maybe it has nothing to do with algebra? That maybe, just maybe, he wants to go to your school to be near you, to be part of your world? Tyson's in his own world. I think we can both agree that he's just not gonna fit. Fit in what? Your image? Tyson is not... Say it, Bobby. Normal? He's not ready. That is such a bad excuse. I can't believe you are that ashamed of him, Bobby. Look, these other kids... They're not yours! They are not yours! Okay. You don't think I'm afraid of what Tyson will face if he were to go? If the other kids will be nice to him? Coach Hollerman, you make them be nice to him. You make them be nice to your son! Ellie? You okay? Eloise? Dinner must not have agreed with my stomach, that's all. You have a great day, Tyson. You have a great day, too, Mom, not homeschooling me. Come on, let's go! - Okay, bye. - Goodbye. Bye again, Mom. Seat belt. Buckle up for safety. Take this. My number's programmed in there, in case you run into any problems. Did you program Mom's number in it, too? Yes, your mother's number is programmed in there. I will try not to run into any problems. Okay, you ready? Okay, the liver. Hello, my name is Tyson Hollerman. I am 15 years old, and until today, I have been homeschooled by my mom. Tard alert. Forrest Chump in the house! All right, all right, calm down, all right. One more crack like that, Bradley Burton, you're gonna find yourself out in the hall. Good morning, Tyson. We've been expecting you. Please, take the open seat. Thank you. I will take the open seat. Guys. Hey, hey! Focus, guys, focus. The liver. You are definitely pregnant. Seven weeks, give or take. Hmm. And is this baby more than likely to be like my first? The likelihood of this child having the same genetic disorder as your first is increased, but I would hesitate to characterize the chances as more than likely. So, pick a number. I mean, are we talkin' 60/40, 50/50? 'Cause I'm gonna be 42 next month. And, I mean, no matter what the odds are, this baby I'm carryin' is gonna be startin' out with two big strikes against it. Things have a way of working out for the best. There's still time. Yeah, too much, and then not enough. All right, this is the stomach. All right? And behind it, is this organ. Who can tell me what this organ is? Bradley. A penis? Now, Mr. Burton, you know very well, that is not a penis. A vagina? All right, that's enough. You just started out your freshman year with an F in anatomy, Mr. Burton. Now, anyone else care to venture a guess? Mr. Hollerman. Pancreas. Pancreas. Very good, Mr. Hollerman. Pancreas. A gland organ in the endocrine and digestive system. It is both an endocrine gland producing several important hormones, including insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin, and a digestive organ, secreting pancreatic juice that contains digestive enzymes that act to facilitate the absorption of nutrients and assist in the breaking down of carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids in the chyme. Thank you, Mr. Hollerman. That was a very, uh, detailed explanation. Now, can anyone tell me what this is? Come on. Here's the staff. Hollerman goes back, lookin' for a man down field. He's got time, but here comes that little White Dodger. And he's got him! He's got him! He goes down with a boom! Hi, Ellie. Hi. How's Tyson? Have you checked on him? I did check on him and he seemed fine. Well, go check on him again. Every 30 minutes, really. So, her old man says she can't see me anymore, until I straighten up and act more my age. I mean, seriously? I'm frickin' 15! So, did you dump her? Like a load of dirt. Hey, check it out. Weird Boy Wonder rockin' the spot. Better chill on crackin' on him. He's Coach's kid. Whatever! I don't play football. Hey, yo, Tyson! Over here! Come sit with us! Don't be rude to our guest, Jonesy. Get your big butt up and give him your seat. There you go, Tyson. Cop a squat. Sit down. Okay. Thank you. You guys! You are such a jerk! You okay? You can come sit with us. Thank you for the fun. Dude, you shouldn't have done that. Why not? The retard had no problem showing me up in anatomy class with his seven billion Einstein IQ. And I'm gonna put Mark um at center. Mark um? The big kid who decorated the end zone with his lunch? Just because a boy needs a little extra attention, doesn't mean he can't be a winner, right? All right, your team. Hello, Father. Hi, Tyson. I've completed my first day at your school, but I didn't learn algebra today, because algebra class is on Thursdays, after History. Hey, Tyson, how are you, buddy? I'm fine, Assistant Coach Sweeney. How are you? Are you fine, too? Yeah, I'm fine, too. Tyson, come in. What happened to your shirt? Shannon says I was punked. I don't really understand what that means, but Shannon is very nice. Not as nice as Mom, but basically, very nice. Did you acquire all of these awards and accolades from all your victories? The teams that I coached did. Who punked you and who is this Shannon? Tyson. Yes, Father? I asked you what happened to your shirt and who Shannon was. Answer me. Bradley and his friend punked me. Shannon is very nice and pretty girl who thinks Bradley is a total jerk. But I think Bradley is just silly and immature. He thinks a pancreas is a reproductive organ. Gentlemen, contact means hitting. It means hitting hard. If you wanna win, you have to hit your opponent twice as hard! Now, our march to an undefeated season and a state championship title begins today. So, let's get after it. You heard what he said! Let's line up and spread out! Let's go! Perhaps, I can become a gentleman on your football team, Father. In order to help you win the state championship title? Well, I'll tell you what. All that stuff over there could use good straightening up. Okay, Father. I will help you and your team by giving all that stuff over there a really good straightening up. Thank you. You're welcome, Father. All right, we play like we practice! We play like we practice! Let's go, let's go! Let's see some speed off the line! Go! Faster! Let's go! Come on, watch the ball on the right side! Speed! Let's go, let's do it again! Execute. Let's go, let's go. Hey, man! Call it when you see it! Find a hole! Come back. Get on the line. Do it again! What is happening here? What is happening here? Get back on the line, and let's do it again! We're gonna do it till we get it right! My grandma plays better than you guys, let's do this. Let's go again, what are we doing? What's your name? My... My name is Tyson. Stand up straight, Tyson. Good. Now, put your hands behind your head and breathe in a smooth rhythm like this. I am Aklilu. Perhaps, we can run together again sometime. Yes. Perhaps, we can run together again sometime. Goodbye, my young friend. Goodbye, Aklilu! Who was that? Aklilu. And I'm his young friend. I'd like to hear more about your first day at school, besides the food stains and football. Well, some of the boys in my grade are going to drive their own cars to school next year. I have a question. Can I drive my own car to school next year, too? Having your own car, Tyson, is a... It's big responsibility. Well, perhaps, I can drive your car, Father, until I am responsible enough to have my own car. Shannon says your car is lit. Who's Shannon? Shannon is a girl and she was nice to me. Not as nice as you are to me, Mom, but she was basically very nice to me. I'm glad you made a friend, sweetheart. Because Shannon was nice to me, does that mean she is my friend, or because she's a girl and nice to me, does that mean she's my girlfriend? And if she is my girlfriend, then does that mean I have to kiss her, like you used to kiss my mother, Father? Eat your food, Tyson. I am eating my food, Father. But is Shannon my girlfriend or just my friend? That's what I'd like to know. I'll ask Shannon if she is my friend or just my girlfriend, if she is nice to me again. Oh, please, tell me that's not Shannon. - No, that is not Shannon. - Thank God. That girl is sexy. Shannon is more like you, Mom. Oh. Well, goodbye, Mom. Tyson, your father will be in his office if you have a problems with those boys again or if you need help with anything, okay? I will try not have a problem with those boys again, and I will try not to need my father's help with anything. Tyson, have a good day, okay? I will have a good day, Mom. Therefore, doctors must rely on patient history and a clinical exam to diagnose mild traumatic brain injury. Know the signals. My head's not only in the game and inside my helmet, it's in your hands. - Yeah, Hollerman. - Saw you on television. Oh, yeah? Mmm. Considering the first kick-off of the season ain't even happened yet, sounds like some pretty big talk. Well, it must've been the camera. You know, they say that it makes things bigger than they really are. Speaking of bigger, got me a new running back. Jerome Walker, up from Katy. Junior, 5'11", 210. Son-of-a-gun cuts like a quarter horse, hits like a daggone freight train. Is that so? That's right. With Walker in my backfield, we're for sure gonna give you and your boys a run for your money, to see who represents our conference at state this season. So, is it gonna be you and this Walker kid, or you get to play the rest of your squad? You'll see what I got in store for you at the season opener, Hollerman. Well, I look forward to it, Ben. You have yourself a nice day. You, too, Bobby. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! From what I see, what you're experiencing isn't a miscarriage, but what is referred to as a "threatened miscarriage." It happens. The good news is that your cervix is still closed and the fetus is still viable. Okay, so, now what? Until we get past this first trimester, plenty of bed rest, plenty of water, stay off your feet as much as possible, and no strenuous physical activity. Anything else? Avoid picking up anything over ten pounds, keep your feet elevated as much as possible. But other than that, you just let nature take its course. - Why wouldn't you say anything? - Say what? It's our decision. No, you made your decision the day that Tyson was diagnosed. I'm not gonna debate this in a parking lot. I'm gonna follow you home. Just go back to school, Bobby. I'm fine. Ellie, we need to talk about this! No, we don't! I'd appreciate it if you did not make me out to be a liar. Okay? So, please. Just go. Tyson just might need you. Repeat after me. I was homeschooled until yesterday. My mother didn't teach me Spanish, because she doesn't speak Spanish. I came to regular school to learn algebra, but algebra class is on Thursday, after History. Being able to speak a second language is a good thing. And Spanish is the second most widely spoken language in the world. But Chinese is the first. Can you teach Chinese? No. I can't teach Chinese. Let's go with you, Shannon. It was Bradley who was looking under your skirt. He had a mirror hidden under his foot, which he slid between your feet. Ms. Fernandez! Oh, my gosh! Ms. Fernandez? I need to speak to you about your son. Okay. Husky feet run in my family. I figure I shouldn't let that stop me from taking on the challenge. Imagine me running a marathon. A challenge is nothing more than an opportunity to believe. I like that. And I like these. I'll take 'em. You trying to get yourself killed? What in the world? Get out of the street! Hey, give the kid a break! - Hello, again, my friend. - Hello, Aklilu. Take my hand. Why were you running? I was running to get away. Away from whom or what? From Spanish class. I often ran away from English class. That is why my English is the way it is. Have that conversation on the sidewalk! Please, come inside my store for some water and some rest. I like the way you say things. Count your lucky stars you didn't get yourself killed, running through the streets like that! The water is there. I apologize for the wait. Please, step over to the counter, and I'll ring up your purchase. All right. Thank you so much! Were you the best runner in the world? There were certain days when I ran well enough to finish ahead of some of the best runners in the world. Can you teach me to run and finish ahead of some of the best runners in the world on a certain day? I can help you to know how to run. But it is up to you where and how you finish. Up to me. Tyson Hollerman, running in his very first marathon, is at this very moment running some of the fastest per-minute-mile times ever recorded in modern marathon history. Tyson is pushing some of the best professional marathon runners in the world to their breaking point. I think we should call your father and get you home. I think we should call my mother and get me home. My father put her number in my cell phone, too. Tyson? Tyson, honey? - Hello, Mom. - What are you doin' here? I am earning my new pair of athletic footwear by helping Aklilu organize his display, to make it more atheistically-pleasing. Hello, Mrs. Hollerman. I'm Aklilu. Hi, nice to me you, Mr. Aklilu? - "Aklilu." - Mr. Aklilu. - Just Aklilu. - Okay. I'm so sorry for any trouble my son may have caused you. Your son is no trouble at all. As a matter of fact, he's a very fine boy and a good worker. The shoes have never been displayed in such a neat and organized manner since the day I opened the store. He does have a way of putting things together. Indeed, he does. We better be going, but please, let me pay you for his shoes. That's not necessary. - Are you sure? - I am sure, Ms. Hollerman. Well, thank you, if you insist. I do. All right, we better get goin'. Come on, Tyson, ready? - Okay, Mom. - Okay, say "thank you" and "goodbye." Thank you and goodbye, Aklilu. Is it okay if I ask my mother if I can help you keep your store organized and you can help me practice to run in my new athletic shoes? No harm in askin'. Mom, is it okay with you if I help Aklilu, and Aklilu helps me? He gave me his card. Oh. Well, we'll talk things over with your father and see, Tyson. We will talk things over with my father and see. So, goodbye again, Aklilu, until I tell you, okay? Goodbye to you, my friend. So, is it okay with you, Father, if I learn how to finish ahead of some of best runners in the world and become a champion like the boys on your football team? Or do I still have to straighten up all their stuff? Are you just gonna stare at the storm all night, or are we gonna talk about this? I really don't know what to talk about, Ellie. I mean, it seems like all the decisions around here are gettin' made just fine without my participation. Well, you "participate" in a sport, Bobby, not in our family. That's not fair. Tyson wants to leave school because of the way he's treated by the kids and the teacher. I mean, that's what's not fair. That was a simple misunderstanding. No, he could have got hurt, Bobby. Well, what do you expect? I expect you to run interference until Tyson finds his footing! Look, if Tyson's gonna go out in the real world, which is what you wanted, he's gonna have to figure out some stuff for himself. You go way above the call of coaching duties to protect the boys who play for you. The boys who can't make the grade or get a girl in trouble. That's different. The difference is that those boys can win you another championship. How many trophies is it gonna take, Bobby? I'm sorry I didn't give you the son you wanted. Come on, Ellie. - Come on. - Don't. Tyson! Tyson! - Tyson! - Tyson! Bobby, he can't handle the storm! He's 5'8" feet. He has blue eyes. Got sandy brown hair, weights about 140 pounds. - Bobby, you gotta find him. - Yes, Miss. - You tell him whose son he is. - Okay. Tyson is Bobby Hollerman's son. - Coach Hollerman? All right. - That's right. Coach Bobby Hollerman. We have a lot of rain moving through the Tri-County area now, all part of that tropical depression that is making its way up and out of the Gulf, into central Georgia. We do have a flash flood warning... Okay. Here, this was taken two years ago. He doesn't really like having his picture taken. Do you know what he was wearing when he left the house? As far as I can tell, he had pajamas on and brand-new pair of running shoes. Orange. Has he ever run away before? From school yesterday, but that was because of some teasing and a misunderstanding with the teacher, but never from home. Is he on any specific medication or being treated for anxiety, depression, anything like that? No. No, nothing like that. But Tyson is on the spectrum. - Spectrum? - Autism spectrum. Oh. That's too bad. He's high-functioning, he's got a really high IQ. It's just sometimes, he's awkward socially. I see. Ma'am, can Tyson swim? He's not a good swimmer by any means, but he is water-safe. We saw to that. The sooner I get this picture in play, the sooner we find your son, and bring him back home safe. - Okay, thank you. - Ms. Hollerman. Coach Hollerman, my name's Sergeant Speena. Sergeant. A 911 call just came into dispatch from a woman riding around in this looking for her cat. Said she saw a kid, running down the middle of the road, wearing pajamas and shiny running shoes. - Okay, where? - Blackwater Gorge, which has gotta be more than 15 miles from your house. Could your son have run that far that fast? I'm not sure, Sergeant, but I'd like to find him. Understood, sir! Follow me! Looks like he might be near Blackwater. How would he have gotten all the way out there? I don't know, I'm with the State Police and we're on our way there. You call me the minute you lay eyes on him, okay, Bobby? Yeah, the second I spot him, I promise. 1557, need additional units over at the Blackwater Gorge. Tyson! Tyson! Yeah, copy that, this is... Tyson! Tyson! Tyson! Tyson! Tyson! Tyson! Tyson! Tyson! - What happened? - A rattler got me. Hang in there. We'll get you out of here. Over here! - What was it? - He's snake-bit! Come on, let's carry him out of here. - Get him to the hospital. - We got you, buddy. Come on, come on. Get up. Put your arm around me. Let's get him out. Come on. Call ahead and make sure we got some anti-venom! What happened? A rattlesnake got one of my guys! With all this rain, these woods are gonna be crawling with them. I'm afraid I'm gonna have to call it, Coach. Till daylight, anyway. It's just too dangerous out here for my men. Your men? What about my boy? Look, we just don't know that he's in here. The lady said that she saw. A kid on the road near the entrance to the park. We have no idea, he could've run the other way. Look, Coach, I'm sorry. Tonight was a courtesy 'cause of who you are. If your son doesn't show up by first light, we'll organize a proper search with as many volunteers as we can get. And I suspect there'll be a lot. But right now, I gotta see about my man. I'm sorry, Coach. Ellie! Please tell me you found him. Not yet. Don't you dare come home without him, Bobby. I'll call you when we find him. - Okay? - Okay. - Hello. - Aklilu, it's Tyson's mother. Yes, Ms. Hollerman. I apologize for calling you at this hour, but have you, by any chance, seen Tyson tonight? No, I haven't seen him. Did he run away again? Yes. And I'm afraid that he's not... Don't be afraid, Ms. Hollerman. Tyson is a very strong boy. He will find his way until he is found. What can I do to help? Tyson! Tyson! Tyson! Father. Keep calling out, son! Father. Keep calling out! Father. I am here, Father. Keep calling out! Father! Oh, my God, Tyson! Hello, Father. - Thank you for finding me. - It's gonna be okay. I'm gonna get you out of here. But my leg is stuck. I tried very hard many times, but I could not get it unstuck. I'm gonna need you to hold your breath for me. Can you do that, Tyson? Yes, I can do that, Father. On the count of three, okay? You're gonna hold your breath for me, okay? - I understand. - Okay. Hold my breath on the count of three. One, two, three. You okay, Tyson? I'm okay, Father, but I'm very cold. Hey, I don't want you to let go of me anymore, okay? Okay, no more letting go. Damn it! You said a bad word. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, son. Help! Somebody, help! No! Aklilu. Hello, Aklilu. His leg is pinned. My shoulder's no good. Hi. Tyson Hollerman? - Room 264. - 264, thanks. Hey, how is he? He's gonna be just fine. Oh, God, I don't how to thank you. You thanked me by asking for my help. Oh, my God. He's sleeping. Ellie, they gave him something, so he could sleep. Your son is gonna be fine, Mrs. Hollerman. - I'm Dr. Windfield. - Hi. What happened, Bobby? A lot. But he's safe now. He's a lucky boy. If he's so lucky, why all this? He was hypothermic when he came in. We are trying to get his core temperature back to where it belongs. - And that? - This is precautionary. Barring any complications, he should be ready to go home tomorrow. In the meantime, Coach, what do you say, we get that shoulder looked at? I'll set you up with an orthopedic doc - down at ER, okay? - Thank you. Does it hurt? It's got my attention. Gave out on me right when I needed it. Aklilu, if it wasn't for him... Tyson wouldn't be alive? I wasn't let gonna let go of him. You better go get that put right. Yeah. I'm so sorry. My baby. My baby. There's a saying among my people, "A mother's heart is held in her hands, a father's, deep within his chest, swollen with pride." I don't know how I can ever repay you. To know that a father's son is safe, is payment enough. Good night. Good night. You are doing great, Tyson. Did you hear what my nurse said? She said I am doing great. Yes, we heard, sweetheart. Well, as soon as the doctor signs your discharge paperwork, then you all can take him home. Won't be but a couple of minutes. We appreciate you. Thank you. The pleasure is all ours. And we're all rooting for you to take the title again this year, Coach. Thank you, ma'am. - Bye, Tyson. - Goodbye. - Take care. - Thank you. We thank you for this food we are about to receive and for seeing us through. And allowing us to bring home our son safe and sound. - Amen. - Amen. Amen. Even though I didn't do such a good job running in the rain, I still want to learn how to run and finish ahead of some of the best runners in the world on a certain day. And I know what day that is. You do? The day of the first Stand bridge annual marathon. Mayor Coleman says it's going to help put our city on the map and make it greater than ever. If I earn new athletic shoes and practice with Aklilu, I can beat some of the best runners in the world during the marathon and help put our city on the map. And I could be a champion like the boys on your team, Father. A marathon is a very, very long race. Twenty-six miles, 385 yards. It takes a special kind of runner with a lot of training, to even compete in a very long race like that. You understand? Well, I could be a special kind of runner, Father. And when I am a champion, maybe I can even become the son you wanted, and then you and my mother wouldn't argue about me anymore. Tyson, sweetheart. I'm so sorry if you heard anything that hurt your feelings. We didn't mean it. Sometimes, people say things that they don't mean. People make mistakes, son. But you're not just people, you're my parents. So, can Aklilu help me to win the marathon? Or do I still have to help you straighten up all your players' stuff, Father? We'll call Aklilu tomorrow, okay? Okay. Why didn't you just tell him to build a spaceship in the backyard, and make it fly to the Moon? You know what? I'd rather tell him he can than he can't. Look, Ellie, I don't want to argue with you. He has unrealistic goals of greatness. The reality is, every dream is not for every boy. What do you think, Bobby, he's like Pinocchio, that one day, he's gonna magically wake up and be more real than he already is? I'm raising him by myself here. Things have got to change. I'm keepin' this child. Let's make a deal. You fight and your daddy will always fight for you. I'm keepin' this child. Hey, Coach, team's on the field and ready for you. Coach? Hey, Daryl. Come in. Yeah, what's up, Coach? Well... I want you to take over the team. I figured you needed a couple of days after what happened, so... For the entire season. I don't understand, Coach. What about state? The team needs you. My family needs me. And I need my family, so, what do you say? Yeah. Sure, Coach. I'm in. Good. You wouldn't happen to have a pair of 10.5 in orange, would you? So, Jesus said to them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothin' of his own accord, but only what he sees his Father doing. For whatever the Father does, that the Son does likewise." John 5:19. Simply put, like father like son. I hope you don't mind me asking, but what kinda name is Aklilu? Aklilu is a Ethiopian name. I'm a Somali-Ethiopian. How long have you been in the US? - Almost ten years. - Do you miss home? I find I could do more for my family and my village by bein' here, than bein' there. So, I am here. Do boys kiss girls in Africa, Aklilu? And if boys kiss girls in Africa, did you ever kiss a girl? And if you ever kissed a girl, did you like it? Tyson, let's let Aklilu enjoy his meal. I will let Aklilu enjoy his meal. But when he is done enjoying his meal, I have a lot of questions to ask him about kissing girls. Remember stay to the right, okay, honey? I will remember to stay all the way to the right. - Ellie, Ellie. - Hmm? - He's gonna be fine. - Okay, okay. Tyson, stay to the right. I'm going to remember to stay to the right. This will help you stay on pace. It's splendiferous. Thank you, Aklilu. You're welcome. Stay relaxed, and remember your breathing. Now, let's see how far you can go in two hours. Let's see how far I can go. Start running. - Now? - Now. - Don't lose him, Bobby. - He's fine, Ellie. I don't know if this is such a good idea. He's fine, Ms. Hollerman. Are you sure he's not going too fast? Tyson does not place limits on himself, so, no limits should be placed upon him. - It's time for his water. - Okay. Hello, Aklilu. - Don't speak. - How are you? Just drink. Drink slowly and not too much. Even though you told me not to speak, is it okay if I say "thank you?" No. Okay, I will not say "thank you." What? Anyone? Tyson. One language is not enough nowadays. Thank you, everybody. Have a good day. So, I was thinking that maybe we could sit next to each other in all the classes together, if you're cool with that, especially in algebra. I could totally use whatever extra brain cells you can spare. That doesn't make any sense. I know, right? I have a question. Are you my girlfriend now? Not yet. Not curving you. But not yet. Why don't you say grace tonight, Tyson? Okay, Father, I will say the grace. Thank you for this food we are about to receive, and for Aklilu, and for the marathon that's going to make me into a champion and put our city on the map. And for my mother and father letting me do. Amen. - Amen. - Amen. That was nice, Tyson. The nuchal translucency looks good. We'll have to have a CMA done to determine the degree of risk for autism. CMA? Chromosomal micro array analysis. It's non-invasive, so, it's not as scary as it sounds, but it wouldn't indicate where on the spectrum the child might fall, if there are signs of autism. We don't need the test. Well, then so far, so good. Do you wanna know what you're having? Well, I think we already know. Another beautiful child. I want to see power here. Three, two, one, shoot. Get up, come on, we're not dancin'. We're not dancin'. You wanna dance, you ask somebody to prom, let's go. Coach, our readers want to know. With an unprecedented, record-breaking season on the line, why did you make the decide to step down as head coach of arguably the best high school football team in the state and one of the best in the nation? It's simple. Priorities. So, is it fair to say that you're putting family ahead of football? Fair to say, I put my family first, yeah. "Family first." I may quote you on that, Coach. - Thank you for your time. - You got it. Watch it, guys, watch it goin' inside! Goin! Goin! Go in! He's goin' in! Goin' in! Come on, come on! Yes! Yeah! Ladies and gentleman, that is your ball game. Final score, Greyhounds 16, Trojans 14. I hope it's a girl. I hope it's a girl and she's just like her mother. Me, too. You really want a girl? I already got my son. Come in. Sir? Mr. Hollerman. Hey, good morning. Morning, Mr. Mayor. Appreciate you coming, Coach. Have a seat. - May I call you Bobby? - I've been called worse. Haven't we all? All right, I gotta say, like everybody else in this town, I was shocked to learn that you wouldn't be leading our team to another state championship. I'm sure there's more important issues comin' across your desk than who is coaching the high school football team. So, what can I do for you? Your son. My son? Yeah, I heard about that business over at Blackwater Gorge. That's a real shame. My son might have some challenges, but it's nothing that we are ashamed of. I meant no offense. Yeah. It's hard to keep up nowadays, with what's politically correct when referring to those among us who are... different. A good place to start might be not calling them "different." Point well taken. So you wanna tell me what I'm doin' here? Yeah, let me cut to the chase. I think it would be best if your son did not run in my marathon. Nothing personal, but the focus should be on the race itself and not on Coach Hollerman's kid. I can't afford to have this thing turned into some social cause or crusade for the mentally-handicapped. You catch my drift? I mean, they have special events for kids just like yours. Heck, they even have their own Olympics. So, why don't you just do right by your kid and have him earn a ribbon or get an atta-boy badge doin' something like that? My son is gonna run in your race whether you like it or not. But it's not just my race, it's my city. You... Not for much longer if you try to stop my boy from running. Okay, well, that sounds an awful lot like a threat. Well, if I announce my candidacy for the fall election, and that's threatening to you, then yeah, maybe it is a threat. I am pretty popular around these parts. All right. If you wanna have your son run a race that he's not even gonna be able to finish, let alone win, you knock yourself out. But you keep him and that drug-takin', blood-dopin', sneaker salesman that you got trainin' him, yeah, away from my cameras and the real runners. Like I said, Coach, it's my city. I think we're done here. Hi, Tyson. Hi, Shannon. Heard they wrote about you in the newspaper. That's lit. Good luck in the race. Yeah, sorry for the way we treated you. Hey, Forrest Chump! I don't care who your father used to be, you're goin' down. I care who his father is. If I were you, butt-for-faces, I'd go sit back down before you got knocked down. Hey, good luck in the marathon, Tyson. Whole team's rootin' for you. Well, thank you and the whole team. And good luck winning the championship without my father being your coach. - He means that... - No, I know, I know. Hello, Father. Aklilu and I ran a half-marathon, which is 13 miles, 192.5 yards, and Aklilu said I ran extremely well. You go in the house, Tyson. Go on, do as you're told. Come inside and take your shower, Tyson. Come on. I appreciate everything you've done for Tyson, but I think it's best if I take it from here. May I ask why? I don't want you spendin' any more time with my son. Let's just leave it at that. Tyson? Tyson! Tyson! Tyson! Well, he's gettin' faster, I'll give him that. It'll be dark soon. We'll find him. Hello, Aklilu. Running, and running away are two very different things, my friend. Why didn't you stay for dinner? Did my father say something rude, hurtful or distasteful when he was speaking to you? Is that why you didn't stay for dinner and left without saying goodbye? Your father was not rude, he was honest. Honest about what? Honest about how he feels. I don't understand, Aklilu. How my father feels about what? How he feels about his son. Tyson. Tyson, are you okay? I'm okay. Father, what feelings were you honest about with Aklilu that made him leave and not stay for dinner or say goodbye? We'll talk about it at home. Let's go. No! Tyson. I want to know what my father's honest feelings are, and why they made Aklilu not have dinner with us or say goodbye to me. Perhaps, it would be best if you talk about it here. I'll make tea. The New York Marathon was my last race. Why, Aklilu? Because he didn't play by the rules, Tyson. Does that mean you cheated, Aklilu? The day of the race, I woke up with a cold. I considered pullin' out of the race, but there was big prize money for the winner. So, you cheated to get money? I sent half of all my winnings to my family and my village. But cheating is like not telling the truth. It's always wrong, no matter the reason. I took a cold medicine before the race for my congestion. After I had won the marathon, I was drug-tested. A banned substance in the cold medicine was detected in my blood and I was disqualified. But that's not fair. You just made a mistake. People make mistakes. Tyson, if you don't play by the rules, it's not fair to the honest athletes. Bobby. It's okay, Ms. Hollerman. Your father is right, Tyson. It was my responsibility to know what was in the medicine. I couldn't understand the label. That's because you ran away from English class, like how I ran away from Spanish class. Why didn't you explain this earlier? You did not want an explanation. Well, we owe you an apology, Aklilu. I am owed nothing. Your son is owed something. What am I owed, Aklilu? A chance. Do you think Aklilu will come? He might, Tyson. I guess Shannon won't be here, because she is not my girlfriend yet. Oh, I wouldn't be surprised if she was here somewhere. I think everybody in this town who isn't runnin' in the race is watching the race, sweetheart. Well, I don't want you and my father to watch me race. Why, Tyson? Why would you say that? I want you to go wait at the finish line, so you can watch me win. Tyson, I just want you to concentrate on running your own race at your own pace, don't worry about your mother and me, we'll be at the finish line no matter when you cross, okay? Okay, Father. I will concentrate on running my own race at my own pace. Okay, how do we... I really wish Aklilu was here. Yeah, we should go. Ladies and Gentleman, I wanna welcome you to the first annual Stand bridge City Marathon! All right, all right. Elite runners, take your mark, get set... All right, let's get it goin'. Come on, go, dude! - Come on. - Hey, watch out, man. - Get out of the way. - Out of the way! I knew he's gonna turn this thing into a circus. All right! Where is he? I don't know, I don't see him. Can you teach me to run and finish ahead of some of the best runners in the world on a certain day? I can help you to know how to run, but it's up to you where and how you finish. Run! Up to me. Give it up for 'em, give it up for 'em now! Come on, let's go, we might have missed him. You're a generous pourer, Clara. You're very welcome. Here we are and the elite runners have Just passed the five-mile mark. How are they doin'? Well, it's early in the race yet to tell, but considering the unexpected warm temperatures, and humidity index, they are doing really quite well. They finished the first five miles in 23 minutes and 11 seconds, which is sub five-minute miles. Can the runners keep up that pace? One of them will have to or even pick up that pace if they wanna cross the line ahead of the rest. Well, we still have a long way to go, but this could be a very exciting finish. And I know you... Tyson! Don't stop, idiot! How far do you think he is? If he's running at his practice pace, he should've been at mile nine. Tyson, I just want you to concentrate on running your own race at your own pace. I will concentrate on running my own race at my own pace. Where once there were ten, now at the halfway point, there are three. Explain. It's simple, really. Right now, we're seeing the best of the best. Unless something unforeseen happens, we're likely looking at our champion, but only time will tell which one of the three it will be. Stay relaxed and remember your breathing. Excuse us, excuse us. Sorry, we're lookin' for our son. - Everybody's got somebody in the race. - Okay, sorry. There he is! He's bleeding, Bobby, he's hurt. Look at his knee! - Tyson! - Let him do. Aklilu! Every runner has one perfect run. This is Tyson's run. El, let's go, come on. - Where are we goin'? - We're gonna go to the finish line. All right, we play like we practice! We play like we practice! Six miles left. What should we be looking for from this point on? How they handle the wall. The wall? Can you elaborate on that term for our viewers who may not be familiar? The wall is the point in a marathon where the runners have depleted their glycogen, and that's the sugar that your muscles use for energy, and once it is depleted, the body has to turn to burning fat. But that transition takes time and the tank is empty until that transition is made. This stops many runners at about the 20-mile mark. I see. Tyson! Here, drink. Are you my girlfriend yet? Yep. Keep goin'. Don't quit. I'm getting word, that there is a development about a mile behind the elite runners that's worth noting, so, let's go there live. And this young man you're looking at now, is the son of renowned high school football coach Bobby Hollerman, Tyson Hollerman. He's only 15 years old. He's running in his very first marathon. That can't be right. All right. The official time for young Tyson for the last two miles, nine minutes flat. If that's true, that is an extraordinary time. It'd be almost world-record pace. Yeah, absolutely. Even at my best, I couldn't do that. A marathon is a very, very long race. It takes a very special kind of runner with a lot of training to even compete in a very long race like that. You understand? Well, I could be a special kind of runner, Father. Only two and a half miles to go, can he do it? Can mighty Tyson Hollerman pull off a miracle, make his mark in marathon history? A history that dates back over 2,500 years. Uh, frankly, I just don't see how. If the leaders maintain their pace, he would have to run the last two miles sub four minutes. I mean, in my opinion, that's just not possible. We've been watching him do the impossible for the last ten miles. Who knows? Maybe this little kid with a big heart is destined to show the world the impossible is possible. Come on, kid! Quiet! You'll make him nervous. - Tyson, come on! - Come on, Tyson. You got it, Tyson! Hey, come on, come on. Why don't you say it? He's what? He's not normal? He's not ready. Yeah! Hey! You did it! You did it, Tyson. Did you see me, Mom? Yes, honey, we saw you. And did you see me, Dad? Did you see me finish ahead of some of the best runners in the world on a certain day? Daddy saw you. Come here. We are so proud. Good job, baby. I'm not entirely sure how it all works, but maybe I was first, so I could learn, and you could learn from me. If you know so much about football, how come you don't play? 'Cause I'd have to play with a bunch of big idiots worse than you. Whatever, dude. If it ain't Forrest Chump comin' to take a dump. Hey, Out-of-your-mind-stein, you run like a girl. Bet you pee like one, too. We better make sure he doesn't flush his skinny butt down the toilet.
