I TOLD YOU CHUCKLEHEADS THAT STORY WAS NEVER GOING TO WORK, DIDN'T I? THEY TOOK AWAY OUR LOGGING CONTRACT, DALLIS. DO YOU KNOW THAT? THAT FIGURES. THEY'RE A BUNCH OF CHICKEN-SHIT ASSHOLES. SPEAKING OF CHICKEN SHIT, WHERE YOU BEEN? I'VE BEEN AROUND. YOU KNEW WHERE TO FIND ME, DIDN'T YOU, MIKE? DAVIS AND WATTERS ARE LOOKING FOR YOU. THEY KNOW ABOUT YOUR CRIMINAL RECORD, THAT YOU LIED ABOUT HOW YOU HURT YOUR HAND. YOU'RE JUST FULL OF INFORMATION. IT DON'T MAKE US LOOK GOOD WHEN YOU-- IT DON'T? THAT'S TOO DAMN BAD, AIN'T IT? NO, IT DON'T! IT DON'T! THEY WANT US TO TAKE A LIE DETECTOR TEST. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT IT? YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT I THINK ABOUT IT? THAT'S RIGHT. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I THINK. I THINK THOSE DEVICES ARE VERY DANGEROUS, MAN. THAT MACHINE SAYS YOU LIED, IT DON'T MATTER IF YOU TOLD THE TRUTH, YOU LIED! IT MIGHT CLEAR US, THOUGH. OH, IT MIGHT CLEAR YOU. YOU KNOW, THEY DON'T NEED A--A BODY TO PRESS MURDER CHARGES, DID YOU KNOW THAT? DID YOU KNOW THAT? AND THEY AIN'T NEVER GOING TO FIND TRAVIS, WE KNOW THAT, RIGHT? THE PRESSURE'S ON DAVIS AND WATTERS TO SOLVE THE CASE. WHO DO YOU THINK THEY'LL ZERO IN ON? WHAT, YOU, CHOIRBOY, HUH? GOD WILL SEND A SWARM OF LOCUST DOWN ON THEM. YOU, MR. PILLAR OF THE COMMUNITY? NO. I DON'T THINK SO. NO, THE QUESTION IS HOW LONG BEFORE YOU BOYS DECIDE TO SAVE YOUR WHITE ASSES AND POINT THE FINGER AT ME? THAT'S A LOAD OF CRUD. NO! THAT'S EXACTLY THE WAY IT'S GOING TO BE!

YOU JUST BE THERE. THAT WAS NICE. THAT FELT GOOD. JUST BE THERE. BE THERE. THE STORY HAS DRAWN INTERNATIONAL ATTENTION, AND THE CONTROVERSY SURROUNDING WALTON'S DISAPPEARANCE HAS REACHED THE BOILING POINT. I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS. I'M GOING DOWN THERE. IN THE FOUR DAYS WALTON'S BEEN MISSING... SURE YOU WANT TO DO THAT? HAVE DESCENDED ON SLEEPY SNOWFLAKE, AND THE LOCALS AREN'T PLEASED. RAY MELENDEZ HAS MORE. THE WHITE MOUNTAINS-- APACHE LEGEND TELLS OF EVIL SPIRITS WHICH FREQUENTED THIS PLACE, DROPPING DOWN FROM THE SKY TO KIDNAP CHILDREN. THE FIVE MEN IN QUESTION STILL HAVEN'T SPOKEN TO THE PRESS. LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES ARE DESPERATELY TRYING TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS MYSTERY. IT'S BEEN FOUR DAYS NOW SINCE TRAVIS WALTON DISAPPEARED WITHOUT A TRACE, AND THE CASE IS ATTRACTING MAJOR INTERNATIONAL ATTENTION. LAW CAN'T GET THEM TO TALK. I KNOW SOME FOLKS THAT DAMN WELL CAN. [SPEAKING JAPANESE] IN THIS LOCAL MOUNTAIN COMMUNITY, THE OVERRIDING QUESTION REMAINS-- WHAT REALLY DID HAPPEN THAT NIGHT, AND WHERE IS TRAVIS WALTON? A CONCERNED TOWN HAS CALLED A MEETING TONIGHT AT THEIR CHURCH TO DISCUSS THESE VERY QUESTIONS. THOUGH THEY WON'T COMMENT PUBLICLY, HOMICIDE IS A WORD THAT IS HEARD ON THE LIPS OF LOCAL INVESTIGATORS. RAY MELENDEZ, ACTION NEWS. THANKS, RAY. IN OTHER NEWS, THE STOCK-- SHERIFF, WE'VE BEEN COMBING THOSE WOODS FOR DAYS NOW. THE TOWN'S GETTING A BAD NAME. MY KIDS ARE SCARED FROM ALL THIS SILLY UFO NONSENSE-- ALL THESE STRANGERS WANDERING AROUND ASKING QUESTIONS. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT? MA'AM, EVERYBODY'S AWFUL CONCERNED ABOUT THIS. NOBODY'S MORE CONCERNED THAN ME AND MY MEN. THEY'RE WORKING 24 HOURS A DAY ON THIS MATTER. WE WANT TO GET BACK TO NORMAL IN THIS TOWN, IF WE CAN. ONE THING I WANT YOU TO KNOW WE'VE ASKED THOSE YOUNG MEN TO TAKE A LIE DETECTOR TEST, AND THEY FLATLY REFUSED. WHAT GOOD'S THAT GOING TO DO, ANYHOW? IF THERE'S BEEN FOUL PLAY, WE NEED TO KNOW NOW THAT OUR TOWN'S SAFE TO LIVE IN. WHY HAVEN'T YOU MADE ANY ARRESTS? COME ON, NATE, THINK IT THROUGH. THERE'S NOT ONE SCINTILLA OF EVIDENCE THAT A CRIME'S EVEN BEEN COMMITTED. EVERYBODY'S GOT A PRETTY GOOD IDEA WHAT HAPPENED. HEY, HOLD IT. YOU JUST... HOLD IT RIGHT THERE. WHAT ARE YOU PEOPLE TRYING TO SAY? WHAT ARE YOU SAYING, GEORGE? ARE YOU SAYING I KILLED TRAVIS WALTON? YOU REALLY DISAPPOINT ME. I WENT TO SCHOOL WITH YOU, NATE. MY MARY, SHE'S AT SCHOOL WITH YOUR KIDS. JACK, LARRY, MRS. PRATT... WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I MISS TRAVIS... JUST LIKE YOU. I--I MISS HIM BAD, BUT I--I CAN'T HELP WHAT HAPPENED. I--I CAN'T CHANGE WHAT I SAW. I WISH I COULD. I WISH--I WISH WE HAD HIM BACK. I--I WISH I KNEW-- I WISH I KNEW HE WAS OK, BUT THAT'S OUT OF MY HANDS AND SO IS WHAT YOU THINK OF ME. WE'VE BEEN TELLING YOU THE TRUTH SINCE THE BEGINNING. AND NOW WE'RE READY TO PROVE IT. WE'LL TAKE YOUR DAMN LIE DETECTOR TEST. YOU SET IT UP. WE'LL BE THERE. YOU GO AHEAD, AND IF ANY OF YOU GOT ANYTHING TO SAY ABOUT ME OR MY CREW, YOU SAY IT NOW, AND YOU SAY IT TO MY FACE. THERE THEY ARE. THAT'S THEM. MIKE, WHOSE IDEA WAS THE LIE DETECTOR TEST? DID YOU KILL TRAVIS? DID YOU REALLY SEE ALIENS UP THERE? DID YOU KILL TRAVIS WALTON? GIVE HIM SOME ROOM. GIVE HIM SOME ROOM. BACK OFF! BACK OFF! YOU WERE TOLD TO BE HERE AT 9:00. YEAH, WELL, WE WEREN'T. FELLAS, MEET CY GILSON. HE CAME FROM PHOENIX TO BE SURE YOU GET A GOOD TEST. HOW DO WE KNOW THAT? I GUARANTEE IT. WORDS ARE CHEAP. HOW DO WE KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE FAIR? I GIVE MY WORD. WE CAN'T TRUST ANYONE, MAN. EVERYTHING WE SAY HAS BEEN TWISTED ALL TO HELL. THIS WHOLE TOWN WANTS TO SEE US FALL. BLAKE, YOU KNOW THAT. I DON'T CARE WHETHER YOU PASS OR NOT. IF YOU'RE LYING, MY MACHINE'LL SHOW IT. IF YOU'RE CLEAN, IT'LL SHOW THAT. HOW DO WE KNOW YOU AIN'T BEEN BOUGHT OFF TO MAKE US LOOK BAD? CY GILSON'S THE BEST THERE IS. YOU'RE LUCKY TO HAVE HIM. WELL, IF YOU SAY SO, IT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME. THE POINT IS, YOU CAN TRUST HIM. WELL, I TRUST YOU, BLAKE. WILL YOU GIVE US YOUR WORD THIS TEST WILL BE FAIR? THAT'S EASY. YOU GOT IT. ALL RIGHT. IS YOUR NAME GREGORY THOMAS HAYES? YES. WERE YOU BORN IN CORONA, NEW MEXICO? YES. ARE YOU CURRENTLY SINGLE? YES. IS MY SHIRT WHITE? FACE AROUND FRONT. SOME OF IT'S WHITE. YES OR NO? NO. FIVE DAYS AGO ABOUT SUNDOWN ON RIM ROAD, DID YOU SEE AN UNIDENTIFIED LIGHT JUST ABOVE THE TREE LINE? YES. DID YOU SEE AN OBJECT HOVERING ABOVE THE CLEARING? YES. WAS IT SAUCER-SHAPED? SORT OF. I DON'T-- I DON'T-- I NEVER SEEN ANYTHING EXACTLY LIKE IT BEFORE. YES OR NO? I'D HAVE TO SAY NO. DID YOU SEE TRAVIS WALTON APPROACH THE OBJECT ON FOOT? YEAH. YEAH, I DID. DID YOU SEE A BOLT OF BLUE-GREEN LIGHT ENVELOPE TRAVIS WALTON? YEAH. MAN. I TOLD THEM IT EXPLODED ALL AROUND HIM. DID YOU BELIEVE TRAVIS WAS KILLED BY THE RAY OF LIGHT? NOW, HOW DO I KNOW? I JUST KNOW THAT I DIDN'T KILL HIM. DID YOU PERSONALLY DISLIKE TRAVIS WALTON? WHAT KIND OF QUESTION IS THAT? HUH? A SIMPLE YES OR NO WILL DO. YES... AND NO. HAVE YOU WITHHELD ANY PERTINENT INFORMATION REGARDING THE DISAPPEARANCE OF TRAVIS WALTON? NO. DID YOU CREATE THIS INCIDENT TO GET OUT OF YOUR LOGGING CONTRACT? NO. DID YOU OR ANY OF YOUR CREW MURDER TRAVIS WALTON? ABSOLUTELY NOT. ¶ BAH BAH BUM BUM ¶ BAM [DOOR OPENS] WELL, WHAT'S THE WORD? WELL, THE RESULTS OF ONE OF THE TESTS WAS UNUSUAL. IT'S INCONCLUSIVE. WE'LL HAVE TO TRY AGAIN TOMORROW. WELL, WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER ONES? WHAT'S THE WORD ON THEM? THE PROCESS IS STILL ONGOING. WE NEVER DISCUSS THE RESULTS TILL ALL THE TESTING IS COMPLETE. SORRY, FELLAS. COME BACK DOWN IN THE MORNING, 9:00 SHARP. NO. WHAT? I SAID NO. LOOK, WE DID WHAT WE SAID WE'D DO. WE--WE CAME IN HERE LIKE GUINEA PIGS AND LET YOU TEST US, BUT WE'VE HAD ENOUGH. I AIN'T COMING BACK. YOU'RE SAYING YOU'RE NO LONGER WILLING TO COOPERATE. IT'S ALL WE DO IS COOPERATE, AND ALL WE GET BACK IS GRIEF. MIKE, WE NEED TIME. NO, FRANK, I'M SICK OF THIS SHIT! YOU WANT TO PRESS CHARGES, YOU GO AHEAD. YOU DO IT NOW. WE TOLD YOU EVERYTHING WE KNOW. IF THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH, THAT'S TOO DAMN BAD, 'CAUSE THAT'S ALL THERE IS. LET'S GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE.
