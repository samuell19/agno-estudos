-We are at Must Farm, near Cambridge, ..in eastern England. This archaeological site is located in the Fenland region, ..which was once the largest swampy area in the country. The large-scale excavations that take place there. .. revolutionize our knowledge of European history. A Bronze Age village, engulfed by the marshes, .. froze in time .. ..until you stumble upon it by chance. -It's a website.. ..of first importance. What he tells us about the way people lived here .. ..3,000 years ago is precious. -The state of conservation and the objects discovered. ..are so exceptional that the village has been nicknamed .. .. "British Pompeii". Archaeologists find ... ..meal leftovers still intact, .. like new agricultural tools, .. very beautiful glass beads .. ..and a large collection of prehistoric fabrics. -The discovery of Must Farm is a capital event. ..in research on prehistory in Great Britain. This is the great discovery. -It's a mini-Pompeii. It's unique. We had already uncovered .. ... farms and houses from the Bronze Age, ..but no wood still intact. Discovering a complete frame is fantastic. -Thanks to the abundance of details, ..we now know .. .. how our ancestors lived when modern Europe ... .. was taking shape. The techniques they mastered, ..the weapons they made .. ..and the commercial networks that connected .. ..this British hamlet isolated to Europe. The discovery a few years ago .. old pieces of wood in the quarry of Must Farm .. .. led to the exhumation of the village. The remains date from the Bronze Age, .. 1000 years or so .. .. before Julius Caesar invaded Great Britain. At the time, we often built in wood, ..material which decomposes, ..but this village has been miraculously preserved .. ..by the Fenland marshes. -We compare it to Pompeii, because it gives a perfect image. ..of life 3,000 years ago ..in this village, .. houses and objects. And all this, in 3D. -Marc Knight, the excavation director , and his team. .. were able to identify 5 circular wooden houses, .. built close to each other. -In front of me, .. we have a 1st circle, a hexagon formed of stakes, ..and around, ..a larger circle 8 m in diameter. We can imagine the frame. ..through the rafters of the roof. They spread out like a fan, ..which gives this impression of a roof that has collapsed. -It is incredible that the frames are complete, ..when the houses collapsed. -What surprises visitors, journalists. ..and the academics, it's that roof, ..a roof from the Bronze Age. We enter the structure. ..and we find out what's inside. -Discovering kitchen utensils and agricultural tools, ..the archaeologists reconstruct the life of the time .. ..with unprecedented precision . -I remember the first time .. ..that I've heard of. We were all looking for that. ..since a long time : an intact domestic space, in its agricultural context, ..which tells us about domestic life .. ..and home life. -For Marc Knight, ... it's a unique opportunity to understand ... ..the privacy of our ancestors in the Bronze Age. -It's incredible ! It exceeds all our dreams. And this feeling of height gives us the feeling ... ..that by leaning forward, ..we will be able to enter the houses. -Mike Bamforth had never had the opportunity to piece together. ..the structure of a Bronze Age village. -As a wood specialist, I couldn't have .. ..dream better. We discover objects, structural elements ... .. constructions, ..the wood scraps. And all the pieces come together. Often in archaeological excavations, ..the puzzle is so incomplete .. ..that we do not represent the whole. Here, for once, we have enough parts. Wood survives everywhere. ..where germs and bacteria cannot attack it: ..in frozen environments .. ..and humid, oxygen free. -The conservation power of these marshes is exceptional. For hundreds of years the ground was waterlogged, ..so the wood is in good condition. He was no longer in contact with the air. However, it is the association of air and water that causes .. ..the decomposition of organic matter. -This village nevertheless contains a mystery. It has also stood the test of time well, ... because while he was engulfed in flames, ..it was swallowed up by the mud. The team hopes that 10 months of construction .. ..will reveal the causes of the fire .. ..and allow to learn more .. ..on the origins of our modern world. The work is meticulous. Nothing should be done in a rush. Each object is gradually extracted from its earth matrix. ..and carefully cleaned. Exposed to air for the first time in 3000 years, ..the wood may dry out and decompose. It must be constantly humidified. All over the site, archaeologists are doing .. .. extraordinary discoveries. -We see a kind of groove on the top. It is obviously a large piece of wood. It extends over this entire surface. Who knows how far it goes? On that side or that one? It also seems to extend to my right. This fragment is weird. It is undoubtedly a stake like this, ..but it seems connected to this piece of wood. Definitely something different. -As the object is cleared, ..it turns out the archaeologists got it right. It is indeed something different. These villagers therefore had access to the most advanced techniques. It is the oldest complete wheel. ..never unearthed in Britain. -It is the best preserved and the most complete. ..which we found in the region. With that, I said it all. It is the largest and the one in the best condition. And above all, it is complete. -This wheel is so remarkable .. ..that archaeologist Maisie Taylor came to examine it .. ... even before it is fully cleared. -It is compressed. It must have been much thicker originally. -This object could teach us more .. ..about manufacture and use .. ..the first wheels in Europe. But this copy is so fragile. ..that to extract it, we must wait for the arrival of a specialist. The discovery of an object so well preserved. .. foreshadows other discoveries .. ..and therefore a considerable deepening .. ..of our knowledge of the way of life of our ancestors .. ..3,000 years ago. A few years ago, in the bed of a nearby river, .. archaeologists have discovered .. ..8 boats carved out of a tree trunk. ..dating to the Bronze Age. It is the largest group ever unearthed in Northern Europe. These boats must have belonged to the inhabitants of Must Farm. For Marc Knight, ..their number indicates that the village did not live in isolation. -All along.. ..of this river, there are boats. If proof of human activity in the area was needed , ..in my opinion, it is there. What would be our level of communication ... ..if in our modern world the Internet did not exist? In a way, ..these canoes and streams .. ..were a communication network. -The villagers had to be skilled carpenters. At Butser Ancient Farm, a prehistoric hamlet. ..reconstructed, archaeologist Ryan Watts .. .. try to understand .. .. how they did it. -We build a monoxyl boat, as there were in the Stone Age, in the Bronze Age, ..in the Iron Age .. ..and until the Middle Ages. These boats are simple. They are carved from a piece of wood, ..but it takes a lot of work. -Ryan Watts is testing. ..with the various tools available to the villagers. -For 2 years, I have explored manufacturing techniques. I test several methods and tools. Right now, to remove the biggest, .. we use wooden corners .. ... rather than bronze tools. Bronze tools require labor to hollow out a trunk. Wooden wedges allow larger wedges to be detached. -Despite its rudimentary appearance, ..the wooden corner gives amazing results. -Once the canoe is finished, ..it should be about 5cm thick, .. about that. We know this thanks to archaeological discoveries . This work requires incredible expertise. This time, I hope to be more efficient. It is necessary to notch the wood, so as to shape the edges. -Through research, ..it appeared that these boats .. ..were intentionally sunk. Ryan Watts thinks he knows why. The transom of some canoes is removable. -You can remove the transom, ..so that the water rushes in and causes the boat to sink. All Must Farm canoes had a groove, ..but the rear panels are gone. They are rarely found. The boat is found under water, which helps in its conservation. They were found intact thousands of years later. Them, it was not to manufacture it every year. -The practical aspect of this means of transport. ..was not the only one that mattered to the villagers. -The dugouts unearthed at Must Farm. ..are the 1st with exterior decorations. Until then, the pieces of wood were smooth. These are engraved. Of course, the patterns are linear and geometric, ..but they exist, ..for no practical reason. They are there to look pretty. ..or so that the owner finds his canoe among the others. -These villagers lived in remote areas, .. on the borders of Europe. Getting around was so important. ..that they did everything possible .. ..to build their boats. As the excavations progress, .. archaeologists find lots of fragments of burnt wood. Marc Knight therefore asked a forensic archaeologist. ..to join his team. By studying the piles and the beams, ..Karl Harrison can help him understand .. ..which led to the destruction of the village. He finds that the pieces of wood were not evenly burned. -This fire is remarkable. ..that he did not reduce everything to ashes. Whole portions. .. escaped the flames .. ..and charred parts have intact surfaces. -This characteristic is found everywhere on the site. -We are near house number 1. As we clear the roof elements, ..we discover traces of a raised floor. These stakes are stakes that escaped the flames. -The study of charred remains helps. ..to understand how the village was destroyed .. ..and how it was built, because alone .. ..the upper part of the houses burnt down. The team thus finds out. ..an unusual construction technique . -The floor was .. ..at this height and at Dan's level , there was water. Dan clears the charred remains of a building. ..located above the water and which is now below. Hence this disorderly pile of elements. It's chaos. But there are many indications there. ..of what there was at this level: pieces of wood that have burned, thatch bundles. ..and a collection of materials and various objects, .as if the floor had fallen here, ..but the thatched roof too. We have to disentangle that and understand the correlation between these elements. -It's a big discovery. The houses of Must Farm were actually built on stilts, ..on the water, ... which explains why they partly escaped the flames. No villages on stilts dating from the Bronze Age. ... had not yet been exhumed in Great Britain. The wood fragments unearthed by the team. ..were used in the construction of houses .. ..and that of elevated platforms. This is the first time that has been highlighted .. ..a link between Must Farm and the European continent, ..where we discovered in the foothills of the Alps .. ..the remains of villages on stilts very similar. One of these hamlets has been restored. .. more than 1000 km from the English coast, .. on the shores of Lake Constance, ..a region where living on the water is an ancestral tradition. -Lake Constance is part of a vast network of rivers. ..extending.. .. all over Europe. Here, we don't think in terms of highways, ..but of waterways. This explains the presence of stands. ..in very important sites. These stands are numerous .. ..and they form a network dedicated to trade and fishing. And then it's a beautiful place to settle. Look around you. -If we have proof .. .. that a number of individuals have migrated across Europe, ..we do not however know the extent of this movement. The discovery of a common way of life. ..in Germany and Great Britain .. ..indicates that 3000 years ago, ..a whole community left the continent .. ..to settle in the East of England. -Maybe they are locals. ..of villages on stilts in Switzerland, the Alps .. ... or the polders of the Netherlands, ..who settled here. This habitat was familiar to them. They mastered the required techniques. They didn't have to invent them. -Objects exhumed in the Lake Constance region. .. prove the existence of a trade in goods .. ..between Germany and Great Britain. -This sword was found in a river, .. about twenty km from here. It is identical. ..to another sword .. ..discovered in the Thames and these points .. ... could have been imported from England to Germany. -There were common ideas, ..but some were evolving. In the Bronze Age there was a form of nationalism. In Britain all houses had to be round. On the continent, they were preferred square or rectangular. We are facing .. ..to 2 different architectural traditions , but there was .. ..many similarities too. -A Must Farm, archaeologists unearth new objects. ..which prove the existence of intra-European relations. For example, those tiny glass beads. It is so unusual to find so many. ..on a British site from the Bronze Age, ..that Julian Henderson examined them. -It's rare. These pearls which date from the 8th and 9th centuries BC. ..are therefore very valuable. -This is the only set of the time. .. discovered to date. -These pearls prove the love of the people of Must Farm. ..for beautiful things, ..but they weren't made in Great Britain. -Copper and iron give them .. ..a beautiful turquoise color or a beautiful pale green. These pearls played a social role. They were decorative. But they can also help us to identify the links that united ... ..the different parts of the world. -The glass was made with sand and vegetable ashes. To establish their provenance, ..the beads were subjected to isotopic analysis. -Must Farm glass is made with ash from shrubs. These plants only grow in semi-desert areas, ..an environment which did not exist in Northern and Northwestern Europe .. ..in the 9th and 8th centuries BC. It could be that these pearls have traveled .. ..3 000, 4 000 km. It is very likely .. ..whether they were made in the Middle East and imported. -We know that in the Bronze Age, goods circulated. .. across all of Europe, but we don't know .. ..the extent of these exchanges. The presence of so many glass beads .. .. indicates that although being away .. ..Must Farm had an active role in trading networks. To find out how Europeans traded in the Bronze Age, ... you have to go south of the Alps, to Italy, ..in the Po estuary. Here was one of the largest manufacturing centers: -Frattesina was an industrial and commercial region .. ..of the Mediterranean basin. It imported raw materials. ..and transformed them into manufactured products for export. She was in contact with the Levant, Lebanon and Palestine, ..with southern Germany and northern France. -Love for luxury products being universal, ..the raw materials arrived by ship in Frattesina .. ..and were exported once processed, all over Europe. -We have two very interesting objects here . The first is this necklace. These little beads are made from .. ..shells .. ..of Ostrich egg imported from Africa. We discovered unworked pieces, .. proof that the raw material was imported and transformed on site. The 2nd big surprise .. ..we comes from ivory. It was coming here in rough fragments like this. The 1st material was imported to Frattesina. ..from Africa or Asia and transformed into combs .. ..on the spot. The most astonishing is that an identical copy of this comb .. ..was discovered at a site in Cyprus. Ivory was imported from Africa or Asia. ..and we made it into a product that we returned. This place was a major manufacturing center . We were at the center of the world here. It is fabulous. -Among these personal effects are also included .. .. pieces of metal. -Here is a mold that is used to make rings. Copper is poured along this groove. From there, side branches lead it. ..to each individual mold. This ring has been detached from the rest, ..but it was not trimmed. If Frattesina made a smashing entry .. ..in archaeological literature , .. it is mainly thanks to glass. The largest number of glass objects were found there. ..of the late Bronze Age, ..and valuable information on their manufacture. -The inhabitants of Must Farm. ..were not the only Europeans to treasure these pearls. -We have here some fragments of glass ingots. ..of different colors. This one is particularly interesting. On and devine the form .. ..of the complete ingot .. ..and they bear the bite of the workman's pincers .. ..to grab semi-molten glass. It's fantastic ! This ingot has kept the gestures of the glassmaker intact . -New scientific techniques. .. may soon find out exactly .. ..which trade route did the glassware take .. ..discovered at Frattesina and Must Farm. -We don't have a job. .. significant and exciting, ..through, among other things, isotope analysis. Research targets the origin of raw materials. ..serving in the manufacture of glass. -European exchanges at the time announced. ..the international trade networks of today. -L'Europe, ..at the height of the Bronze Age, ... let's say from 1600 BCE until 700 BCE, ..when iron gradually imposed itself, ..Europe was a totally interconnected world , .. like never before. But the bronze supply was irregular, ..when hamlets and farms needed it. The supply had to be more regular, ..that trade routes remain open. And for that, we had to set up institutions. ..which promote these links and the regularity of exchanges. -Researchers have always lacked elements to determine. ..the standard of living of our ancestors in the Bronze Age. The number of metal tools unearthed at Must Farm. .. is all the more surprising. -We think that this blade is a sickle. It is interesting that she still has some sparkle. This site is unique. Once exhumed, ..the objects still shine. Unbelievable ! -Throughout northern Europe, the Bronze Age was marked. ..by intensification and expansion of agriculture. This revolution and commerce were favored. ..by the development of these metal tools. -Bronze allowed people to .. ..to engage in new activities. It is a malleable metal. ..to which we can give the shape we want. Farms and hamlets. ... all needed them. -Many elements show that Must Farm .. ..was a very prosperous agricultural community . The large quantity of wooden utensils. ..indicates that the villagers were producing enough food .. ..to organize feasts. -We found clay pots and wooden crockery. This is what is believed to be a wooden dish. There might have been a handful here and one there. It is carved from a single piece of wood. The edges burned. It had to be used to present a dish. Maybe a pig's head? -Archaeologists have also discovered .. ..bones of sheep, pig and beef .. ..and pots filled with grain. In fact, agriculture was so flourishing. ..that part of the grain could be marketed. This prosperity was due .. ..to the fertility of the soil, to the herds, ..but also to the appearance of metallurgical techniques .. ..and the application of scientific advances to agriculture. -Some farms had .. .. hundreds, if not thousands of head of cattle. And the cultivation of cereals was done on a very large scale, ..with the systematic practice of spreading. Fertilizer was found in these fields. L'intensification de l'agriculture.. ..have had significant effects on the lives of ordinary people. For example, as far as I know, ..there is no sign of malnutrition .. ..at the Bronze Age. And huge amounts .. ..of meat were eaten on the occasion of festivals. -In the city of Halle, ..in the heart of Germany, .. there is an object which indicates that scientific progress .. .. surely benefited European farmers of the Bronze Age. The Prehistoric Museum houses such an extraordinary treasure. ..that it is considered by Unesco as one .. .. major archaeological discoveries of the 20th century. It is called the celestial disk of Nebra. It was unearthed by amateur prospectors in 1999. This representation of the night sky. ..is the oldest known. It allows us to assume that the farmers .. .. knew when the time for sowing had come . -This is the 1st faithful representation of the celestial vault. -We can make out a cluster of stars, the Pleiades, ..which were of crucial importance to the growers . -The drawing is very simple. Here we have the 7 stars that form the Pleiades. ..and there, the Moon. Their simultaneous presence indicates a highlight of the year, ..the beginning of March. -The Pleiades, visible in the northern hemisphere in winter, .. disappear in the spring, .. around the period suitable for sowing. -The important thing here ..it is not metalwork, but knowledge, ..delivered by a drawing .. ..simple and talking. -Analysis revealed .. ..that the metals of the Nebra disk .. ... had been partly imported into Germany. -We analyzed the copper. He comes from the Alps, from the Mittleberg region, ..near Salzburg. Pewter comes from Cornwall, we are sure. As for gold, analysis shows. ..that it was also mined in Cornwall. The raw material therefore comes from .. ..from Germany and England. -The need for metals and the taste for luxury products. .. have brought together the different European peoples. -Great Britain had .. ..an essential wealth: tin. Unlike copper, tin is a rare metal. It is not found in many parts of the world. It was a commodity that was very important. ..and very difficult to deliver uninterrupted. We could not do without the 10% tin that comes in .. ..in the making of bronze. Tin was therefore the most precious metal , ..probably on par with gold. -New European commercial networks. ..were created to ensure the transport of metals, ..then extending to other goods, ..they favored .. ..the circulation of people and ideas. -In the Bronze Age, ... Europe was to have 13 to 14 million inhabitants. She was extremely organized at the time. Merchants, soldiers, ..all kinds of people were moving, .. bringing with them new things. -As the population of Frattesina .. ..and Lake Constance, ..the inhabitants of Must Farm have understood .. ..that the waterways opened the doors of Europe to them. That is why they established themselves above the water. -They realized that by settling in the swamps, on the water, ..they mastered an environment that allows exchange, ..the movement of goods. They placed themselves at the heart of the activity, of the commercial flow, ..which gave them some control. -They had the best of both worlds. Behind them was the earth. They cultivated their fields and raised cattle. In front of them were the marshes, with the fish, .. eels, wild birds. The most precious, .. it was protein in winter, .. because the recurring problem of the 1st stands .. ..was the lack of protein. How to survive the winter? These people had a fantastic reservoir of food. In summer, when the water level fell, ..the swamps suddenly became .. .. very rich pastures, because the land .. ..had been fertilized by the floods. These people weren't stupid. It was a very wealthy area, so they settled there. -The Must Farm excavations tell us a lot. ..on the way of life of our ancestors in the Bronze Age. Thanks to the discoveries made in one of the houses, ..we can go back to the origins .. ..of an old industry: the manufacture of fabrics. -We have here a fabric of great finesse. I found it there, embedded in the clay. It's by digging. ..that I found this piece of cloth. This is the upper part. These fragments show us how fine the weaving is. Never such a quantity of delicate material. ..n't been unearthed in a Bronze Age site. It seems incredible that fabrics ... .. could have withstood such humidity .. ..for 3 millennia. To analyze the finesse of the work, ..Marc Knight called on specialist Susanna Harris. -We can't always send. ..the objects in the laboratory. You have to be able to transport the equipment. -The study under the microscope gives a better idea. ..of the sophistication of weaving techniques. - This is called the warp and weft. Here are weft threads. They go behind these warp threads. ..and emerge a little further. Look. -Susanna Harris discovered that these sons .. ..were made from vegetable fibers, ..which requires great know-how. Observations made under a microscope. .. reveal that they are only 2 / 10th of a mm thick, .. proof of extremely careful work .. ..and a great professional mastery . -I drew a line 5 mm long. ..and I will count the number of threads. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. On 5 mm, we have 13 wires. That makes us 26 threads per cm. Must Farm fabrics. ..are as fine as those unearthed on the mainland. -The quality of these fabrics tells us that 3,000 years ago, ..our ancestors did not just exist. They loved beautiful clothes and decorated their homes. -These fabrics were not necessarily black or brown in the past. Part of our research is ... ..to reconstitute textures and colors .. ..in their original beauty. -The study of these textiles will teach us a lot more. ..on the way of life of Europeans in the Bronze Age. In the hamlets of Lake Constance, ..similar fragments have been found. And like those of Must Farm, ..they come from baskets, nets .. ..or more refined materials. -This set comes from the villages of Lake Constance. There are nets, very fine fibers. A universe of textile products. -The commercial relations being very developed then in Europe, ..a market for fabrics may have existed. -The villages were delivered mainly .. ... to trade in copper and tin, ..separately, in the form of ores, ..the alloys were made on site, ..but also in the form of finished products. Now, once you have trade routes ... ..and the merchants who borrow them, ..it is obvious that we will sell and buy other commodities. These last few years, it's very recent, ..we learned that alongside the metal trading, ..there was a trade in woolen fabrics. -A Must Farm, .. archaeologists have unearthed .. ..a set of tools used in the manufacture of fabrics, ..an unprecedented fact in Britain. -This huge object, which has the shape .. ..a club or a cricket ball .. ..is a magnificent copy .. ..d'écang. We found 3 on the site. Their weight and shape allow .. ..to grind the stems of one .. ..to extract the fibers intended to be spun. In a regular movement, the pond is folded into a groove, ... by crushing the rods across. -The discovery of these tools and textile materials. ..is an extremely rare occurrence in Europe. It will establish ... .. how fabrics were made and used ... ..in a village from the Bronze Age. -This thread is wrapped around a spindle. We imagine people spinning fiber. It is as if we were attending .. ..in the manufacture of these fabrics. -Archaeologists have even discovered accessories. ..which went with the looms. -We found.. ..3 weight in house number 1. A pyramidal shape, .. pieces of clay assembled and fired, ..the whole pierced. It is used to tighten the warp to pass the weft threads. This element allows us to complete the puzzle. -What was discovered at Must Farm, .. it is the origins of the European textile industry. These spinning and weaving tools. ..are the ancestors of our modern machines. -It's very rare, exceptional, ..to discover all the elements of the manufacturing process, ..stems of plants .. ..to finished products. Our textile specialists. ..will be overwhelmed. -With equipment of this kind, ..clothing for sale must have been made. We now have such a wealth of detail. ..that we can almost imagine our ancestors, ..leaning over their work, day after day. The considerable number of exhumed objects. ..hows to think that the village has been abandoned .. .. at the time of the fire. Archaeologists hope to find out why. ..its inhabitants left , leaving everything behind. Karl Harrison is looking for .. ..to define the method of propagation of the fire. -When our research has enabled us .. ..to understand.. .. how the fire spread, ..we will know if a fire has developed in this structure .. .. before expanding to the next .. ..or if two fires set two different houses ablaze . Which would indicate that the fire was deliberate. -It must first determine how the houses were built. -This piece of wood illustrates. ..the way the behavior of a fire .. ..can help to understand construction techniques. There are 3 modes of propagation of a fire in a building. We speak of conduction. ..when metallic materials cause .. ..a heat transfer. Convection, when the fire causes the rise in the structure. ..a mass of hot gas. And by radiation is when the heat transfer .. .. is done through a body. -Determine if the fire has spread by conduction, ..convection or radiation will be very difficult. Karl Harrison must analyze the traces left by the fire. -The upper part of this beam has been blackened, ..except.. ..a few circular areas. As if a structure placed above had protected these areas. On this side, we can see the limit of the burns, ..which indicates that the lower part is intact. -This piece of wood did not burn. These marks were only caused by the heat. -It did not burn, because it was outside. The fire especially ravaged the interior. The radiation travels in a straight line. ..and this part was protected. It's like slathering on sunscreen. -If the pieces of wood outside have not burned, .. this allows to establish the place of origin of the fire. -The fire caught inside. No one set the roof on fire from outside. The mode of propagation would have been very different otherwise. - So that the villagers give up as many things, ... the fire had to spread very quickly. The team will need to collect more clues. ..before establishing whether the villagers fled an attack .. ..or if the disaster was accidental. The discovery of the oldest complete wheel in Europe. ..is a particularly exciting event for the team. In order to extract as delicately as possible .. .. this object buried for 3,000 years, ..specialists were called in to assist . -We tried to lift her up. ..in 3 pieces, but it doesn't work. We're going to use plaster to consolidate it. But since we can't protect all the way around, ..we will have to change technique. We chose to make a box around the wheel. ..and inject polyurethane foam into it. Once fully wrapped in expanding foam, ..the wheel will be securely held. We can then dig holes below, ..to slide in wooden bars .. ..and lift it up in one piece. -Ian Panter relies on his skills as a carpenter. ..to overcome all difficulties. Once cleared, this wheel will teach us a lot. ..on the first techniques developed in Europe. It is not a simple object. It is the proof of an explosion of know-how. ..and manufacturing methods. -One of the reasons that make me love the Bronze Age, ... is that this period clearly marks ... ..the beginning of the specialization. Certain carpentry works. ..are extremely sophisticated. The wheel is comparable to canoes, .. because it offers an example of very advanced woodworking, ..very specialized. We have exceeded the milestone. ..good or bad carpenters. We have specialized carpenters here . On the one hand, wheel builders, ..on the other, boat builders. -The discovery of this wheel confirms the existence. .. close relations .. ..between the European populations of the time. -The Must Farm wheel is part of a set. It looks like copies unearthed in the Netherlands, ..in Denmark and southern Germany. The wheel builders of this hamlet. ..should relate to others. All shared a common know-how. -We know how these villagers shared their lives. ..between dry land and marshes. -The presence of this wheel is intriguing in a village on stilts, ..without space to roll such a big wheel. We have a means of terrestrial locomotion. ..in a marsh environment. But it sticks with the other elements discovered on the site. The bones are mostly those of land animals: ..sheep, cows, horses, dogs. As plants, we have holed wheat and barley. The wood used for the construction of the village. .. comes from terrestrial rather than swampy habitat . The villagers have not cut themselves off from the mainland. ..and the wheel is part of that link. They lived, slept, ate here, ..but they cultivated their fields .. ..and they traded on the surrounding land. The remains of material exhumed on the site are proof of this. Ditto for objects like the wheel. -Archaeologists have learned that the peasants of Must Farm .. ..were prosperous peasants, who traded .. ..with stands from all over the continent. But they were surprised by the profusion of their possessions. Like us, they had more than they needed. -We are here. ..in house number 2, where there is .. ..many containers: wooden buckets, and pottery. This jar. This pretty little bowl there at the back. And this other jar. There are large containers and small cups. These objects are intact, grouped in heaps, ... buried in their original context. It gives us an excellent idea of the use we made of it. -Like us, ..these people liked to surround themselves with beautiful things. -What characterizes first of all .. ..these objects, it is their great finesse. They are very beautiful to look at, because there is nothing primitive about them. These vessels are anything but rude. They have admirable finishes: nicely streamlined body, everted edge. The other characteristic is the color. This pot had a nice dark color, ..but the fire changed it. -Archaeologists have also exhumed. ..2 very strange long pieces of wood . Each has 3 mortises. ..containing the remains of burnt posts . Timber specialist Mike Bamforth is puzzled. -We don't know what it is, ..but we think we can solve the mystery quickly enough. We do not know if these are the 2 halves of a vertical element. ..or placed on the ground .. ..or the 2 lower parts .. ..of a vertical element. We will find. - Further examination suggests that this is a frame. ..used in the treatment of textiles. Research is still needed, ..but the remains of Must Farm already prove .. ..that our modern way of life appeared in the Bronze Age. One of the main characteristics of this village. ..is the series of piles that surrounded the dwellings. Like the piles, these piles were .. ..deep into the ground. Erecting such a structure was a technical feat. -A fence surrounds the site. It's a row of ash stakes, ..with a few oak piles inserted. She had to arrive .. ..at head height. The use of ash is very unusual. The other pieces are in oak, .. more robust. This choice reveals a heightened aesthetic sense. It must have been.. ..very pretty. -Given its large dimensions, ..the palisade was also to fulfill a protective function. -These villagers physically cut themselves off. ..of the mainland .. ..and they erected a barricade to protect themselves. This fence could fulfill this defensive role. -Like other stands across Europe, ..Must Farm got richer through farming and trading. An unexpected number of properties were discovered there. In each house were exhumed. .. about twenty pots and metal tools, ..weaving equipment and other utensils. Did people feel vulnerable to attacks ..for this reason ? Inside the enclosure, spear points. ..were unearthed. -There were some all along the fence. Perhaps people with their spears were on guard? In this universe, there was no .. ..than baskets, pottery and round houses. These people felt .. ..the need to bring oneself .. ..a sword and a spear. -The team unearths objects. ..can be used as weapons. -I am in house number 1. We have discovered.. ..a socket ax. It was exhumed about 1.50 m on this side. We have one. ..in this section and one there. There is an ax in each quadrant. The handle fits into this hole and the side ring. .. is used to attach the strap. Looking closely, we can see small veins. There are 3 on each side. ..and also the mark of the joints of the bivalve clay mold. -The discovery of swords, a weapon that appeared in the Bronze Age, .. fascinates the team. - Yesterday, we found this bronze sword. Usually, old bronze is covered with verdigris, ..but due to the excellent state of preservation of the site, ..it kept its original color. -An astonishing number of swords have been exhumed, .. inside and outside the village. -Here is the blade of a leaf-shaped sword . She lost her handle. It matches the style of sword we were making. .. at the time .. ..and we found it near the layers of ash. It belongs to this hamlet. -This discovery is important. She could help solve a big puzzle. Were swords prestige weapons ... ..for elite warriors .. ..or was it used daily? Neil Burridge is a blacksmith specializing in prehistory. - This is the moment that I dread. The top of the mold. .. has split, ..but it does not matter. I add a little more. It is a very skilled job. I am the person. ..the most experienced in this field, ..but in the Bronze Age I would have had 1 in 10. It's very difficult. -The crafting of a single sword requires almost 1 kg of bronze. Thanks to Neil Burridge, ..we know that our ancestors invested .. .. a lot of resources to forge these items. -It's incredible, ..what they were doing with bronze. They got very creative and they invented weapons. For us, the sword is a common object, that we know, ..but it is an invention .. ..of the Bronze Age. -As you see, ..the mold broke. And here is the melted piece. It's not that bad for a first try. The mold was cracked more than I expected. ..and the blade is too thick. By Bronze Age criteria , it is heavy. We wouldn't have wanted it. -Even experienced specialists like Neil Burridge. ..have failed to manufacture .. .. replicas of as good quality as the originals. -It is necessary to work the blade, ..to have something that looks like this. The blacksmiths polished the surface. ..with what they found in the area. The next step is very important too. You have to forge the edges. ... until they are as thin as paper. It is a very skilled job, because the blade is beaten with a hammer. That's what gives that narrow, beveled edge . Working the metal cold makes it hard. ..and to tap the edge. It is a very important operation . It is probably necessary to heat the bronze several times. ..to give it flexibility .. ..and forge the edges 2, 3, 4, maybe up to 8 or 9 times .. ..to make them sufficiently tapered. It is very sophisticated work. A sword discovered at an excavation site. ..is often covered with verdigris. She is not beautiful. But in the Bronze Age, once over, ..it must look like this, well polished, ..with its decorated handle and blade .. ..well sharpened. -We now know that in the Bronze Age, ..swords were very complex to craft. However, the state of several copies discovered at Must Farm. ... indicates that they were not prestigious objects, ..but weapons used by ordinary people. -The presence of these deep notches on one side of the blade. ..might mean that the sword was used in battles .. ..or that she hit another metal object. -The Bronze Age swords being shorter. ..than those of previous eras, ..we don't know exactly .. .. how men fought. The copies discovered at Must Farm .. ..will be rich in teaching. Newcastle University has incorporated them. ..to his study of combat techniques. -We keep away from each other, ..then we get closer immediately. There is no middle ground. Either the opponent. ..is out of reach, or we are face to face. An exciting technique. -Andrea Dolfini studies the weapons of the Bronze Age. -These weapons were used in various battles, ..but we don't know exactly how. -The weapon is so short, it's like fighting with a long knife. It's a very close fight, ..which requires commitment .. ..much more personal. -The marks left by the blades. ..will provide valuable clues. -Swords. ..of the Bronze Age show similar notches. The 2 blades came knocking against each other, ..then have surely rotated. -It's a very violent fight, very physical, but which requires .. ..a great intelligence. You have to learn to assess the opponent. ..to impose his will on him. -The objective is to analyze the marks made today. ..and compare them to those we observe .. ..on the swords of the Bronze Age, in order to learn .. ..on the fighting techniques of the time. -When you handle a sword made to kill, .. you have to protect yourself. One thing while training .. ... another, over time, ..we are developing much more effective warfare techniques. The profession of warrior appeared in the Bronze Age. -The specialists still wonder if the gain of prosperity .. ..in the Bronze Age, .. has not resulted in an increase in violence. The Must Farm site seems to indicate that it has. In the opinion of archaeologists, ..the village suffered a terrible attack. As proof, the quantity of weapons exhumed. ..and the reaction of the inhabitants who did not return home, ..not even to recover their precious possessions. -It's obvious that they had to leave .. ..hastily. Looks like everything was left as is. .. barely a minute or two ago. When we have time to organize, we take our things. We clean our house. There, that was not the case. In my opinion, ..there was a disaster, ..maybe an enemy attack. Houses and farms burned down and collapsed. It happened so quickly .. ..that people could not get anything out of the burning houses. -Nothing really indicates .. ..that they returned after the fire. Looks like what drove them from home, ..it wasn't just fire. Maybe we set fire to get them out of there. -The excavations of Must Farm have already shed some light. some of the great mysteries of the European Bronze Age. We know that through trade, ..very close ties united villages across Europe. Travel was an integral part of life. Some villagers owned more property. ..than we imagined. And by generating social tensions, ... this wealth may have led to greater violence. What is most fascinating is the state of preservation of the site. .. allowed us to dive, like never before, ..in the daily life of our ancestors. We know what their kitchens contained, .. what clothes they were wearing .. ..and what techniques were used .. .. at the time of the birth of modern Europe. The team must complete the site in a few weeks. -The more we dig, the more questions we ask ourselves, ..the more information we have. Each new element tells us a story. This is the final phase of the work on site. Then, many objects will be studied under a microscope, .. sent to the laboratory, analyzed, measured. Our knowledge will be enriched. We will discover colors, .. textures, which will modify .. ..our understanding of the time. -At the end of the work, .. everything will be covered with earth in order to preserve the site. Years of research will still be necessary. .. before this village .. .. does not reveal all its secrets. But our vision of birth .. ..modern Europe has already changed. -It is a site of 1st importance. What he tells us about the past, ..about the way of life of people 3,000 years ago is precious.
