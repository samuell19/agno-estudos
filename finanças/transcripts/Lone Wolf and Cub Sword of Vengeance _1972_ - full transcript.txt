TOHO CO., LTD. A KATSU PRODUCTIONS FILM Our lord! This is unjust. My lord, I will follow you. All of us will avenge you. Even if it's the Shogun's will... Not our young lord... Our lord! - My lord! - Our lord! All of you, do not lose your composure! How unseemly at this last second! Now that it's come to this, the least you can do is... ...remain quiet and witness the last moment of our lord. As his loyal vassals, it is our duty. I am Itto Ogami, Shogunate Executioner. Please... Please do it well. You only need to take this fan and hold it against your stomach. Are you ready? Such is a lord of country and castle, a fine samurai. The Tokugawa Shogunate took an iron-fisted approach in controlling the daimyo lords with their han domains within Japan. Any sign of disagreement could cost a lord his title and his family land. In this reign of terror, three separate agencies were created. First, a network of ninja spies called Oniwaban, or Garden Wardens, was tasked to seek out reasons to abolish the han domains. Second, Shikaku, or Assassins, were charged with killing domain officials who might obstruct the Shogunate's political will. Third, to assist condemned daimyo lords perform the seppuku self-execution, the Kaishakunin, the Executioner, was tasked to be their second - their final decapitator. The spy network was operated by the Kurokuwa clan. The assassinations were performed by the Yagyu clan. And... ...Itto Ogami was the Shogunate's Official Kaishakunin Executioner, privileged to wear robes bearing the Hollyhock Crest of the Tokugawa clan.

Let me see. “Son for Hire. Sword for Hire. Suio-ryu Swordsman, Itto Ogami." Itto Okami. “Okami” as in “Wolf”? No, “Ogami” as in “Pray.” it must be the name of that ronin. “Sword for Hire” makes sense, but “Son for Hire”? Who knows? Hello. He looks down-and-out in these bad times, with a child to boot. Can he make it? Wow, what a cute kid! So cute he's pitiful. Come back! O-Mine! Come back! O-Mine! What are you doing? Toramatsu! O-Mine! Toramatsu! Stop that! What are you doing to someone else's child? I'm sorry for her rudeness. Please forgive her. I'm so sorry. Excuse me, but it says “Son for Hire.” Would you really hire out this child? Toramatsu, you must be hungry. Here. Have your mother's milk. Drink a lot. Daigoro. Have some. Go ahead. Isn't it delicious? Toramatsu. I got you. Good boy. Thank you very much. Easy, easy. Toramatsu, I'll save up money and come see you again. Just a moment. Would this be enough? I don't need your money. It just so happens he was hungry. Is that so? Thank you very much. A man deceived her and then left her. She had put up her baby for adoption, but he caught a cold and passed away. Since then, as you can see, my daughter has gone insane. She can't tell other people's children from her own. Damn, it's started to rain. Welcome home. What's wrong? You don't look well. What's troubling you? Tell me. Of late, I have had awful nightmares. I think it's the people you helped commit seppuku - stuck in horrible places in Hell like the Needle Mountains and Blood Lakes, howling at us in blood-curdling voices. “We curse you and the Ogami clan.” Over and over. I'm so worried about our son. This is not like like you, a strong woman. You must be tired. Azami, neither you nor I shall ever forget why we named him Daigoro. We wish him to be undaunted when faced with hardship, not to be spoiled should he become rich, to be mindful of the five other Realms - Hell, Ghouls, Beasts, Struggles and Heaven - and to live out his life as a strong human being. Yes. Don't worry. He'll be a strong boy who won't succumb to any unreasonable circumstance. Dear. Fortunately Daigoro is now one year old. I'll introduce him to the souls of the various lords I've been second to. I'll be in the family temple. Just a monk at night... COLD NIGHT PRAYER Azami! Azami! Azami! Daigoro... Daigoro... Azami. Who could have done such... Who did this? Damn. I'll hunt them to the ends of the earth. I'll comb through weeds to the roots to find them. I will avenge you. This I promise. I'm So-Metsuke, Inspector General, Yagyu Bizen-no-Kami. I'm here on official business. Master Yagyu. I feared such a tragic incident. You feared? This morning, three men committed seppuku in front of the gate of the Yagyu clan. I hurried over because of their letter vowing to punish evil. Vowing to punish evil? VOW TO PUNISH EVIL “We vow to avenge our Lord Hirotada and placate his departed soul and to eradicate the Ogami clan of the Shogunate Executioner. Itto Ogami serves in the high office of Official Executioner, but he abuses his authority, like a parasite in a lion's body. He is a traitor who aims to overthrow the Shogunate. Know that such proof exists inside the Ogami family temple. In the name of the Shogunate and mindful of the grief of our lord who met his demise by such a traitor, we hereby punish the evil Ogami clan and then follow our lord in death. Sanshu-Ikoma Domain vassals Hyogo Otai, Shichinosuke Watabe and Gorozaemon Makijima.” Signed in blood. Three samurai killed themselves to deliver this letter. It is my duty as Inspector General to inspect your family temple. Lead the way, Master Ogami. The family temple is where I pray for the peaceful rest of the souls of the various lords I was second to in the name of the Shogunate. A most admirable intent. I am impressed, Master Ogami. What is this? What's the meaning of this? A memorial tablet with the Hollyhock Crest? Why do you have a memorial tablet for the Shogunate? Answer me! What do you pray for in this family temple? I don't understand. I've never seen this tablet before. Who could have... So it was true what the letter said. I don't get this. This can't be... Disgraceful of you to make excuses! Come with us. As Inspector General, I must interrogate you. Come out and arrest Itto Ogami. This is strange. Master Yagyu, why are they prepared like this? Have they been prepared to take me by force from the beginning? It's an emergency. Naturally we came prepared. Then you would come armed and prepared. There shouldn't be any need to conceal the arms under robes. And what about this chain mail? Did you have time to put this on before you rushed over? No need to talk! I will listen to you when I interrogate you. You set me up, Yagyu. All this makes sense only if you and the Yagyu clan have plotted this whole incident. I said you're wrong, Itto Ogami. Because I am not guilty of anything at all, the Ikoma samurai had no reason to commit hara-kiri. But it all fits together if you schemed to bring me down. Everything is arranged all too well. I know about Ura-Yagyu. They hunger to obtain the post of Shogunate Executioner. You fixed this for that purpose. Ura-Yagyu? What do you mean by “Yagyu shadow clan”? Are you accusing our Yagyu clan of having two faces - one public and one secret? Sure. Munenori's sons, “Jubei” Mitsuyoshi, Tomonari and Munefuyu, they are the public faces. His other son, Gisen, also known as Retsudo, is the Ura-Yagyu. Retsudo is your grandfather. He holds the real power and controls Yagyu from the shadows. I'm well aware what Ura-Yagyu is. He secretly plots with the Shogunate officials. He has the Kurokuwa ninja network under his control. Now he intends to destroy me and seize the high post of Executioner. Your Double Hat Crest. It's for Omote-Yagyu to deceive the public as Shogunate Sword Master. But the Ura-Yagyu carries the crest passed down from its founder Mimasaka-no-Kami Ieyoshi - Two Swallows and Great Burnet, which is proof enough. What say you? Impressive, Itto Ogami, how well you know us. Now you leave us no choice but to have you killed. “Itto Ogami fought with the Ikoma Domain samurai and fell under their murderous blades.” it's all arranged perfectly. I see. You forced the Ikoma samurai to write that confession letter and forced them to commit hara-kiri. There's nothing you and the Yagyu clan wouldn't do to satisfy your greed. Unforgivable. You'll pay. Kill him. Attack him! Damn it. Once in the water, Ogami can take full advantage of his Suio-ryu swordsmanship. Bizen is such a fool. This is bad. The Suio-ryu Wave-Slicer. Retsudo of the Ura-Yagyu? You damn little brat! You and Ura-Yagyu use every treachery to advance your clan's glory. I will never forgive you! I will crush the Ura-Yagyu with the wrath of the Ogami clan. The Yagyu exists because of the Shogunate, and the Shogunate exists because of the Yagyu. Do not forget that. Struggle as you may, you are nothing. This destiny has been set in stone. Fight me, Retsudo! I won't fight you. Now that Bizen has been defeated, I'll make sure the Shogun settles the matter. Wash your neck and wait for the blade. Wait, Retsudo! I will never forgive you and your Yagyu clan. The river of greed, the Omote-Yagyu. The river of fury, the Ura-Yagyu. Though you may attack me on two sides with plots and treachery, I'll walk on the white path of righteousness. Though I may become a corpse or reduced to bones, I shall have my vengeance. What is happening, sir? He's here. He's the Shogunate Executioner who disappeared after a conflict with the Yagyu clan two years ago. The Shogunate Executioner? The Itto Ogami, then. Even an army of Yagyu swordsmen failed to kill him. Is that him? There's a rumor about an assassin called Lone Wolf and Cub. You must have heard about him. How do you know, sir, this assassin is Itto Ogami? It says “Sword for Hire.” If it is Master Itto Ogami, what will you do, Chamberlain, sir? When we left our home, you two promised to protect the Oyamada Domain and its tribute of 30,000 koku, and you pledged your lives to me. - Yes. - Yes, sir. You two are the best swordsmen in our domain. If that man is not Itto Ogami, you two will kill him. I understand. We two might kill him, but it'd be better if we get killed. Chamberlain, sir. We'd be glad to give up our lives. I am Gyobu Ichige, the Oyamada Domain Edo Mansion Chamberlain. I wonder if you happen to be Master Itto Ogami, who used to be Shogunate Executioner. I asked you to stop by as I have a sincere request to make. Please forgive my rudeness if I'm mistaken. Let me hear your business. I would like to request an assassination. There are four to kill. 500 ryo for an assassination, regardless of how many I must deal with. One more thing. You must tell me all the secrets and reasons. I ask you to count it. Tell me the story. Our Domain House Elder, Kenmotsu Sugito, intends to treacherously kill the legitimate but sickly heir Noriyuki and have Takemaru from a branch family succeed our lord and thus grab absolute power of Oyamada Domain. Lord Noriyuki will be visiting his domain for the first time. He'll leave Edo in two days. No way Kenmotsu would pass up this opportunity. Our covert investigation reveals he has gathered ronin vagabonds and scoundrels and intends to ambush Lord Noriyuki and his men. On the Nikko Highway, eight miles before Imaichi, there is a mountain road called Otawara Road. GO-NO-MORI Down this road, on the border with our domain, there is a hot springs resort called Go-no-Mori where Kenmotsu has his ronin standing by. We had a report that Kenmotsu would visit Go-no-Mori today or tomorrow to discuss his plans. Thus the three of us steeled ourselves, determined to kill Kenmotsu at the cost of our own lives. Kenmotsu Sugito has under his command three skilled Nen-ryu swordsmen called the Oyamada Three. Especially Junai Matsuki, who also serves as Inspector. He is a skilled gunman on a horse. We don't have a chance against him. So we were ready to surprise them and kill them and then be killed. But now that we have you, please use your skills on the traitor Kenmotsu Sugito. Please, I beseech you. Atop a tall mountain Here If you drop a hard turd Here you go Covered in sand Roll and roll, down and down That one goes bouncing This one goes bouncing That one goes bouncing Daigoro. The Shogunate's men will be arriving shortly. But your father is resolved to defy the Shogun's will and escape this place alive. To avenge the Ogami clan and to clear our name, to clear the dishonor, I'll abandon the way of the warrior and live on the Demon Way in Hell. Listen, Daigoro. Your father will walk the path of blood and death, the way of the assassin filled with slaughter and cruelty. Only by taking this way of the assassin can I avenge the Ogami clan and crush the Yagyu clan. Daigoro, you may choose your own way. Choose this Dotanuki sword and you'll join me in the way of the assassin. Choose this ball and I'll send you to your mother in the nether world. Daigoro, of course you don't understand anything - not your father's words nor what is about to happen. However, the blood of the Ogami clan in your body shall determine your destiny. Now... choose. Choose! Daigoro! You would've been happier if you'd joined your late mother. My poor child. An assassin with a child. Remember, Daigoro, this is our destiny. ORDER Sword bearer Itto Ogami. Despite serving in the high post of Shogunate Executioner, you have placed a memorial tablet with the Hollyhock Crest inside your family temple, which can only mean you wish to curse the Shogunate to death. This act is unforgivable. Thus your employment is terminated, your family name is abolished, and you are hereby sentenced to death by seppuku along with your son, Daigoro. It is most admirable that you greeted us dressed in white robes of death and befitting Itto Ogami, the Executioner renowned for his swordsmanship. Your resolve is magnificent. We didn't put on these white robes to cut open our stomachs. From this moment on, my son and I shall live on the Demon Way in Hell. These robes mark our departure. Do you intend to defy the Shogun's will? Have you gone insane? We're on the Demon Way and are no longer ordinary humans. To us, the Shogun's will is... ...laughable! Fight him! Fight him! Can you kill me? Can you kill the Executioner with your skinny arms? You're insane to dare to defy the Shogun's will. Kill him! What are you waiting for? Kill him! Itto Ogami. Accept the Shogun's will and commit hara-kiri with dignity here. I'll be your second and executioner. You and the Ogami clan have been relieved and we, the Ura-Yagyu, have been ordered to the post of Shogunate Executioner. Thus, we'll behead you as your second in accord with etiquette. I refuse. Your plots and treachery killed my wife and framed me for a crime I did not commit. Wherever I go to live, I won't rest until I have my revenge. You're singing a condemned man's song. Your resistance must be seen as futile. You may be a master Suio-ryu swordsman. But against the Yagyu clan's Wall of Swords, it's impossible for you to break through. Is it? Damn you, Itto! I've faithfully served the Hollyhock Crest for 27 years. You, for 60-odd years. In all the more than 60 states of Japan, every person lives under this crest. Its usefulness is beyond measure. Behold. Even the Yagyu swordsmen can't dare to touch me. You can't kill me without damaging this crest. What say you! Isn't it impertinent to hold your blades aimed at the Hollyhock Crest? Out of my way! Wait. Take off your robe with the crest and hand it over. Then the Yagyu clan will challenge you to a formal duel. If you win, you may go wherever you want and you may earn your living wherever you want. So long as you stay out of Edo, we'll see to it that you'll be left alone. What say you? Very well. Kurando has the setting sun on his back. Itto Ogami has his son on his back. They both have something on their backs. I can already see how this contest will end. When they are evenly matched in their skills, the one who takes advantage of the lay of the land and the forces of nature will be victorious. Atop a tall mountain Here If you drop a hard turd Here you go Covered in sand Roll and roll, down and down Atop a tall mountain If you drop a hard turd LEFT - TO IMAICHI RIGHT - OTAWARA ROAD Covered in sand Roll and roll, down and down HOT SPRINGS SPA GO-NO-MORI Bastards! Damn bastards. Why didn't you give up already? Hey, you with the brat. Should I chop off the rope and drop you both? If you lose the bridge to the Otawara Road, you'll find it difficult to leave. What a wise guy. Fine. Come on over. A Dotanuki sword. It cuts through bones without damaging the blade. One can wield it at will on horseback. A sword for the battlefield. You got a nice piece. I'll hold on to it. Why are you here? Do you need a reason to visit a hot springs spa? Are you really here for the water? I'm with my son. What other purpose could I have? So true. You two are an unfortunate family, though. You've come to a hot springs in hell. Fine. Come with us. Let me warn you. If you do anything funny, we'll stab both you and your kid. Help! Somebody! Help! No! Dad! No! Help me! No! Stop it! No! A good daddy can't show this to his kid, huh? No! No! Please stop! O-Kayo! Bastards! Devils! I'll kill you! Looks like she's dead. You choked her with your strong arms and fed her your big fat thing. Hey. I thought she was just a kid, but she had a body to die for. How dare you enjoy her all by yourself? You fool. Who is that? A hot spring guest with a kid. He had a Dotanuki. Turns out he's a docile pussycat. No wonder he's quiet. He can barely stay upright. Have we met before somewhere? No. Your name? I could tell you, but I no longer use my name. Answer me anyway. I'm Tahei Onishi, a ronin from a western province. You're right. I've never heard of that name. He was carrying a Dotanuki, so I thought he might have some skills. But he fell for the old cup-throwing trick. He's nothing. Listen, if you disobey us even a little, you and your kid will get my throwing knives in your throats. Take them to the bath house. Come. What a skilled swordsman. What? Are you saying I missed him? He may be skilled, but he's with his kid so he can't do anything. It seems he's not stupid enough to take on so many of us. Fine.I'll test him to see how skilled he is. Forget it, Monnosuke. No! If he's as good as Shigarami says, it means he was ridiculing me and my flying knives. I gotta find out for sure. You'll come with me, Shigarami, won't you? That man... I'm sure I've met him somewhere... You should've figured out by now we're all wanted men. Don't be stupid and disobey us. Come outside. I wanna see how good you are. Come out so we can fight one-on-one. Don't you hear me? Damn you. Don't you care what happens to your kid? Give it a break. What kind of fool do you think would fight a wanted man? That'd be like throwing away his life. What? He is a ronin, but still a samurai. He can't admit he's afraid and beg for his life in front of us. So he keeps his eyes closed and just takes it. Enough already. Let him be. I see. You do make sense. Pretty smart for a whore and a pillow thief. Right, O-Sen? And you're just talking beasts. What did you say? Fine. I'll let him be. In exchange, let's have the two of you do the deed. Right now. Right here. We'll sit back and enjoy the show. That'll be fun. Do it. No way. Who'd ever... Ridiculous. I can pay admission. Your trade is selling your body. You're also a pillow thief who steals from the men afterwards. Why don't you give us an eyeful of your special bed technique. Bastard. If you don't want to... I'd rather die. Is that so? Then you'd better die. Wait. You... You wouldn't... No way... Would you... If you'd accept a woman like me... Do whatever you want. She's acting like a virgin. Must be feeling like the Goddess of Mercy, trying to save a life. A wet goddess, that's her. Merciful Buddha. Merciful Buddha. Merciful Buddha. Merciful Buddha. Merciful Buddha. Merciful Buddha. Merciful Buddha. Merciful Buddha. Merciful Buddha. Cut it out, you damn monk. Hearing you pray, I feel like we're already dead. We're in a living hell. When they leave, they'll kill us all. That's not decided yet. There are dozens of villagers here. They are just hiding in their houses. Even those bastards won't kill them all for nothing. But think about it. Unlike the villagers, we're travelers. If they let us leave alive, news of them might spread. Which means... You're right. They'll surely kill us. Damn. Are you telling me to be quiet and wait to get killed? Bastards! We can fight, but it won't do us any good. They're beasts. Do something please, master samurai. I don't want to die. I don't want to get killed. Help me. Yoshi, what do you think such a sick man can do? You saw what that ronin did earlier. He has no shame when it comes to saving his skin. He's a shameless animal, just like those bastards, except he's had his fangs pulled and he's helpless. Shut up! What are you, then? A gambler and a pickpocket, aren't you? Earlier, I was going to bite off my tongue and kill myself. But he saw through me and he swallowed his pride and made love to me. How happy I was. I'm not worth even a glance from him, but he gave up his samurai pride to save my life. Keep talking nonsense. Hundreds of samurai pay for cheap whores. Don't kid yourself. Would those samurai give up themselves to save the life of a cheap whore? He slept with you to save his own skin, didn't he? Don't you get it? Ask your little boy hanging below your belly button. What do you mean? When you're afraid for your life and trembling, can you satisfy a woman? Where are you going? Aren't you afraid of them? I'm ready to die at any time. A woman like me only grows more miserable as she gets older. This hot springs spa is called Go-no-Mori. Everybody calls it Bats' Hot Springs. Do you know why? Bats are not birds, but they have wings. They're not beasts, but they have fangs. Bats don't belong, just like the visitors here. Outsiders like us gather here for a moment of rest. Hence Bats' Hot Springs. But those thugs are different. They are beasts with fangs. And you... You're a bird with wings. What are you saying? You're not afraid of the beasts' fangs. You've got wings to get you out of here whenever you wish. I can tell. I've gone from man to man all my life. I know about the wings you've got. This past summer, I stayed in the castle town of Takato, where four samurai from the castle were killed. They were killed by a ronin accompanied by a child. I remember the four slain samurai were skilled swordsmen too, because the investigation was very thorough. They said, “Lone Wolf and Cub. He gets paid to kill people. An assassin.” That's what they said. The heir and his party are on the Nikko Highway. The day after tomorrow, soon after noon, they'll be entering Jizo-ga-Hara. This is Shogunate land. It's perfect for an ambush. Once in Oyamada Territory, it would be difficult. You must do it here. Get it? Got it. Where's the money? 500 ryo now. You'll get the remaining 500 ryo when everything is done. I'm counting on you, Kanbei. Failure isn't an option. Leave it to me. Can I take a look at that? A rider's handgun, right? You can't. If you've got a toy like that, why don't you do it yourselves? We can't leave evidence. Also, when you are attacking them, we must be at the castle. I see. If you are all gathered in the castle, nobody will suspect you. Exactly. Lord Noriyuki and his party will be assumed to have been attacked and tragically killed by ronin ruffians, leaving us in the clear, without suspicion. If we are the ruffians, you are disloyal and traitorous bastards. Watch your language. Easy. Anyway, no slipups. Everything is understood. Come on out, all of you! We'll kill you if you don't hurry. Come out! Come out! Come on out! Move. Hurry. Listen, all of you. You've been good to us. It's time for us to leave. However, there's one thing I want you all to remember. If you say one word - or even half a word - about us to the officials, you'll all be dead. Get it? - Yes. - Yes, sir. You guys, however, must die now. There are two reasons. If we let you leave, you'll talk about us. You've seen our faces. There's another reason. We must make examples of you for the villagers. Consider yourselves unlucky and give up your lives. Spare me. Please. Don't kill me. I'll never say anything about you. So, please... Please spare me. - Please. - Save me. Help me. First, samurai, you'll have to die. Pick it up. And then come attack me. We'll let you die like a warrior. My lord. I'm prepared to die. However, I'm too sick to fight you. I'll commit hara-kiri. I'd like to ask you to be my second and executioner. Executioner? Executioner... Merciful Buddha. He's praying. Another word for “pray” is... “Ogami.” The Executioner. Itto Ogami. Where's that ronin with the kid? I knew it. What's wrong? Let's kill that guy with the kid. No. Don't even touch that man. Let him go. What are you saying? What's wrong? Don't even lay a finger on that man. What are you scared of? What about such a wimp? Idiot, don't. What's with such a coward? Monnosuke. This can't be... Suio-ryu Horse-Slayer. Damn you! I'm not part of this. Spare me. I won't tell anyone. I won't tell them you're Itto Ogami, the former Executioner. Spare me. You! Unforgivable. - Who are you? - Identify yourself. Who are you? Assassin Lone Wolf and Cub, at your service. What? Merciful Buddha. Merciful Buddha. I knew it. Lone Wolf and Cub. Wait. Wait for me. THE END
