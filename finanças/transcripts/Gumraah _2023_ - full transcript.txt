Here you go. That's not necessary, ma'am. Come on. It's clearly a case of theft. There were two people involved. They thought it was an empty house and broke in last night, but the landlord caught them. There was a fight. This guy tried to defend himself. But the two overpowered him. They stabbed him and fled through the back entrance. After that... Yes. It rained all night, so the roof has leaked. Check the surroundings. We'll catch them by evening. You've got it all wrong. - Jai Hind, ma'am. - Jai Hind. Is this how you investigate a crime scene? - Where are your gloves? - Actually… That's SI Shivani Mathur. The Commissioner has appointed her. He entered through the main door. The first struggle happened in the living room. Then the victim ran upstairs to escape. The killer picked up a vase and threw it at the victim. The victim fell on that piece of glass. Then they struggled to overpower each other. Finally, the killer used a weapon and murdered the victim. - Did you find the weapon? - No, ma'am. And then the killer started to cover up the crime. He got rid of all the evidence and put the body in the bathtub and poured water on the floor, to get rid of the footprints and fingerprints. If there was a leak in the roof, there'd be a visible mark! There's only one set of footprints. So, there was just one attacker. He definitely entered through the main door. Then why did he exit from here? The suspect has a smart criminal mind. He has knowledge of forensics. Looks like a well-planned murder. All criminals are bound to leave some evidence behind. Jai Hind. It's just impossible. Of course, there are police officers who can't find the evidence. Kesla, you're getting fat. - Sorry, sir. - You should go jogging. - Body? - Please come, sir. Sir, that's Aakash Sardana. Who else lives here? It was just him, sir. His sister lives in Saharanpur. We've informed her. She'll be here soon. Good. What about the weapon? We are yet to find it. You won't find it. Sir, the wounds are quite deep. A sharp and pointed object was used. It's not a regular knife or dagger. I assure you, we'll have a profile of the weapon by evening. Sir, I think... Kesla, order some tea. - Hey… - Sir, here's your tea. Wow, Gupta! - Yes? - Sir, I think the motive is personal. You think so? Look, SI Mathur, we work on the basis of hard evidence, not mere assumptions. The Commissioner has personally appointed you for this case, so carry out the investigation, find the evidence and bring me the report. Sir! I don't know that, ma'am. Tell me what happened last night. Ma'am, I finished my work and left at 6:00 p.m. He was fine at that time and was watching TV. What kind of a man was he? He was a good man, ma'am. He was not very social. He'd keep to himself all day and work on his computer. Any enemies? Who all are there in your family? It was just me and Aakash. We lost our parents long ago. Was Aakash associated with any wrong people? No, ma'am. He hardly knew anyone here. He returned from the US just four months ago after his divorce. Divorce? He always wanted to settle down in India, but his wife didn't. What was his occupation? He wanted to have his own tech start-up. He even withdrew some money from our family account recently. How much? Around 20 lakhs. Ma'am, there is no cash. The CCTV hasn't been working for two months, ma'am. Did anyone visit Bungalow No. 22 last night? No. Some drunks were causing a commotion on the road around midnight. Come on, move it! I made sure nobody entered the compound. Check the register for entries from last night. Summon the owners to the station for questioning. Yes, ma'am. - Where were you on Wednesday at midnight? - We were at home, but we sleep at 10:00 p.m. No, ma'am, I wasn't there. That's my holiday home. I only go there for vacations. We were at home. It was our movie night. We've bought a new home theater. I was out of town. I returned this morning. Did something exciting happen in my absence? Do you know Aakash Sardana? What kind of a person was he? I used to see him during our morning walks, but we never spoke. No, ma'am, I didn't know him. I've seen him in neighbourhood gatherings. Nice guy. We've seen him at the gym sometimes, but we never spoke. He is very handsome. I'm sorry. I mean, he was. I was planning to introduce him to my niece, but then I found out he was divorced! Did you see anyone or hear anything in Bungalow No. 22? No, ma'am. I see. So, someone used to live there? Ma'am, give me time until evening. I'll find out. Next. Ma'am, this is Mr. Mehta, from Bungalow No. 21. The one next to Aakash's bungalow. Speak up. Yes, ma'am… I… I was there Wednesday night. But I swear, we didn't see anything. We? - It was my girlfriend's birthday. - Okay. So, I was spending some time with her. You don't have time for your family, but you have time for your girlfriend! Sir. Show me your phone. Sir, it's been two days, and I wonder what Ms. Mathur is up to. - If you want, I can... - Come on, Kesla. What's the problem with being a spectator for once? Let her enjoy her enthusiasm. It's not her cup of tea, sir. - We still haven't found a lead. - Sir, we have a lead! There was a couple in the bungalow across from Aakash's on the night of the murder. I checked his phone and found this. Two kids are taking selfies to update their profiles, so? Sir, zoom in on the left side. That's Aakash's balcony. This photo was clicked on Wednesday at midnight. I've forwarded the photos to the headquarters. The criminal will be identified shortly. Arjun Sehgal?! Sir, do you know him? He's 28 years old. He's an engineer by profession. Lives in Sector 22, Gurugram. - Kesla. - Yes, sir. Confirm his address with the Aadhar database. Go, get him. - Forward the photo to me. - Yes, sir! Arjun Sehgal… You're done for. - Arjun Sehgal? - Yes? Come to the Sector 30 police station for routine questioning. Hey! Listen! Open the door! Why was I brought here? They called it routine questioning, but it's been five hours. Ma'am, what is all this? They've confiscated my phone. I want to talk to my lawyer. We will return it. We will return your phone and summon your lawyer as well. Sir, what do you want from me? What's your problem with Aakash? Who is Aakash? Aakash Sardana, Bungalow No. 22, Greenfield Society. I don't know anyone named Aakash Sardana. Where were you on Wednesday, the 2nd, at midnight? I was in my office. There was a party. Hey, that's… You left the party early. Why? I had an important registry the next morning. I wasn't feeling well. Hold on. You had to sign a land registration the next morning… but you didn't show up. Why did you lie? I don't lie. I cancelled the registry because I wasn't feeling well. What are you trying to frame me for this time, sir? Speak up! Come on, speak up! Tell us everything clearly. Kesla, please stop. Are you trying to kill him? So, you left your office party at 10:30 p.m., and it takes half an hour to reach your house. But according to the CCTV cameras in your building, you reached home at 2:00 a.m. Where did you go? My car had a flat tire. Where did that happen? On Noor Manzil Road. Kesla, does it take three hours to change a tire? It's a 20-minute job, sir. My jack was broken, and there was no mechanic around. It was raining heavily, and nobody stopped to help. Weren't you carrying your phone? The battery was dead. Finally, a taxi driver stopped by and helped me. Give me the taxi company's details. It wasn't an Ola or Uber taxi to get all the details. He's playing smart, sir! Help him up. Come on. Aakash Sardana was murdered on Wednesday night. He was stabbed multiple times. Why are you telling me all this? You don't know Aakash Sardana… and you have never been to Bungalow No. 22 in Greenfield, correct? Then what were you doing… on Aakash's balcony that night? Your game is over. Case closed. Everybody, out. You can't escape this time. Forget about your career and love life. I'll make sure you spend the rest of your life in jail. That's not my photo! The ACP is trying to frame me. - Return my phone! - Kesla, close this case. File the charge sheet. Sir, there's a problem downstairs. Why is there a crowd? What's so serious? - Sit down. - Shut up! Sir, this is Ronnie. His full name is Sooraj Rana. He's drunk. The Border Patrol caught him. He misbehaved with the policemen. - Hey, come here. - Let go of me! He even slapped one of them. The SHO over there saw the circulated photo of him and sent him here immediately. Hey. The one in pink? Jahnvi Behl. She reviews movies for AT Online. Since when have you been reviewing her? Every day at 8:50 a.m. sharp, I get a chance to see her in the elevator. If I miss the elevator, I don't see her until the next day. She knows that I look at her. By the time we reach the tenth floor, it's just me and her. Then just awkward silence for the next two floors. Do you guys speak or just maintain silence? Yes, we spoke yesterday. I finally asked her. Can I take you out for a cup of coffee? No greetings, no introduction. A coffee date directly?! I can only ask one question in five seconds. If you say yes to coffee, then we can introduce ourselves there. Why are you building up the suspense? What did she say? So? Your question is wrong. Ask the right one, and maybe I'll answer. Wrong question? Pal, I've heard of wrong answers, but since when did questions start going wrong? Okay, bye. You're a feminist, aren't you? Why should only guys ask girls out on dates? So, would you take me out for a coffee? I'm sorry, the question is still wrong. Is it about the equality thing? Okay, let's just buy each other coffee. Would you like to share a coffee with me? Sharing is caring! Hey, give me a clue. There's an old saying in Himachal that goes, "a girl will lead you on even if she isn't interested in you." She is just mocking you. You're just having fun, right? Killing time with me? You can't crack the question, and you're blaming me. By the way, the offer is still valid. Can we go out for a coffee? Can I take you out for a coffee? Will you take me out for a coffee? Your question is wrong. Ask the right question, and maybe I'll answer. Oh, shit! Excuse me. Would you like to have some tea? The one served in earthen cups? Couldn't you just say that you prefer tea? Were you having fun misleading me? Absolutely! I was having a blast! - By the way, I'm Arjun... - Arjun Sehgal. Civil Engineer from IIT Delhi, MBA from RIT Bengaluru, lead designer at Pyramid Heights, lives in Gurugram, travels by metro. You own a blue BMW, but you only use it on weekends to show off. You work on the seventh floor, but you go up to the tenth floor every day just to hit on me! You're a stalker! - Should I file a police complaint? - Go ahead! Tea. - To stalkers. - To stalkers. These eyes These eyes of yours tell me That you've been up all night Thinking of me I've formed a new habit all of a sudden - Hello… - I feel more alive You've played a new tune of love for me Oh, my love! Oh, my love! You're the love of my life I wish you never let go of me I don't care if the world burns I want to dance until I'm tired I want to stay awake all night I don't want to go home tonight I don't care about the world I want to dance until I'm tired I want to stay awake all night I don't want to go home tonight This heart now beats for you I wish you feel the same for me Nothing can come between us now You are mine, and I'm yours This is all I dream of My only wish is to have you by my side I don't care if the world burns I want to dance until I'm tired I want to stay awake all night I don't want to go home tonight I don't care if the world burns I want to dance until I'm tired I want to stay awake all night I don't want to go home tonight Why did you call me here so late? Are you all out of your minds? I'm sorry, brother. The situation demanded it. Who is this troublemaker? He's a new client! Is he trustworthy? I don't know about trust, but his business is booming in the market. Oh, hello! Welcome! I'm Kulbhushan. This guy? Were you waiting by the door? You entered at the correct time. It's my congenital problem. I'm very particular about time. Where are the goods? You may leave now. You too. What is this? Send them away! We don't want any police trouble! - There are TTC cameras everywhere. - Please listen. - Don't you know? - We cut the TTC camera wires. We also cut the wires of the lights. We even put a fake number plate on the vehicle. Nobody saw a thing. There's no chance of getting caught, sir! We planned every detail. It's totally safe. Why have you come to me if you have everything planned out? We've uprooted the machine, but the model is new. If we open it forcefully, the machine will turn all the notes black. You must have got a hack, like a mechanic or something. - Are you sure there's money inside? - At least 20 lakhs, sir. How do I believe that? I guess you don't watch the news, sir. Take a look, sir. Right now, we are reporting from the JPU ATM on the Manesar Highway. As you can see, the entire ATM machine has been uprooted and stolen. It is said that this gang steals these machines shortly after they are reloaded. Today, the machine was reloaded with approximately 24 lakhs. Will the police be able to catch this gang? Keep watching Asal TV. I am Mona Awasthi, with Cameraman Ashok. There's a guy who can open it. But the loot will be divided equally. All right? Done. Call your guy. I don't have him in my pockets. Do you see the time? Leave the machine for now. I'll call you tomorrow after he cracks the machine. Do we look like pizza delivery guys? Come on, Ronnie. Forget it. Let's go. - Bro, are you crazy? It's a good deal... - Hey, stop! Now, there are two more people who know that you've stolen the machine. Let's hope it doesn't make it to the news tomorrow. "Two ATM robbers caught!" Give that to me, bro. Here are two lakh rupees. Keep it. It's a matter of trust. We'll settle the remaining accounts after cracking the machine. Okay? Don't overthink it. You shouldn't look a gift horse in the mouth. Done! The machine will be opened in my presence. Done! What was he saying? The machine should be opened in front of him? Look! He isn't here. Open it, bro. Hurry up. What is the problem? Why have you brought a toy, sir? The notes are fake. You… Scoundrel! These are fake notes! Do you think we are stupid? I'll get you abducted right away! I'll massacre your clan! You have no idea what I'm capable of! Sir, why are you being so disrespectful? You've got the wrong news. I'm sending you the right one. So, it is considered that a bank... Not a bank. Who brought her? Deliver the dialogues properly. Come on, try again. You just hold the camera. Hold the camera. You taught me not to look a gift horse in the mouth. That's what I did. This feeling of intoxication My emotions are not under control Everyone says I'm royalty Of course, I am All these beautiful women Are driving me crazy This isn't going well Girl, you're driving me crazy Girl, you're driving me crazy Girl, you're driving me crazy Girl, you're driving me crazy Those who make a bet and win Are the kings of the game These guys carry luck in their pockets The heart beats fast, everyone gapes at me Sometimes, I face the repercussions All these beautiful women Are driving me crazy This isn't going well Girl, you're driving me crazy Girl, you're driving me crazy Girl, you're driving me crazy Girl, you're driving me crazy Girl, you're driving me crazy Girl, you're driving me crazy Girl, you're driving me crazy Girl, you're driving me crazy So, it's called Fifth Avenue Condos. There is a total of ten units, all 3BHK premium luxury apartments. So, what do you think? It's really nice, but what are we doing here? This is my company's first construction. Are you serious? Arjun, that's amazing! I've been working on it for three years, you know. It's been my dream. Sometimes, I feel like I've become over-ambitious. Arjun… people are afraid to start working toward their dreams, and you're scared after almost completing your dream?! I've invested all my savings in this. I've also taken out a loan. If this fails… You can't plan every outcome of your life. Besides, what's the fun in doing something if you already know its result? Take us for example. If you already knew I'd like you back, wouldn't you have missed out on the joy of asking me every day? Everything will turn out fine. Just believe in yourself. I was eight when my father died. Sometime later, my mother remarried, and we moved to Dubai. I did move there… but it never felt like home. Now, I hardly talk to my mom… except for messages on birthdays and New Years'. But she is happy there with her new family. That's why I came back. There's something here… that gives me the feeling of being home. What's wrong, Chaddi? Why are you so sad today? Nothing much, brother. I am missing my dad. Do you see this shop? It belonged to my dad. I took over the shop after he passed away. Chimanlal Electronics. Why are you lying on the sidewalk when you own the shop? They've sealed the shop up! What did you do? I didn't do anything, bro. I used to sell phones and tablets in bulk. Sometimes, I'd put a bar of soap in the boxes and sell them. Everyone does it. Once, I sold it to the wrong guy. The guy looked like an idiot. He looked worse than a security guard. But his brother is the ASI in the Sector 25 police station. You are so screwed! Brother, I started begging for forgiveness… offered him free phones, but that scoundrel filed a case. He says he'll send me to jail for sure. The final hearing is scheduled for tomorrow, and the lawyer says I'll get a four-year sentence. I am ruined. Chimanlal, do you have the case file? By now, the jailer must be picking a cell to put me in. You know what they'll do to a tender and handsome guy like me in jail, right? Mr. Sharma, I have come to request an out-of-court settlement. No, we don't want any settlement. This is a case of cheating. He has already decided that an example must be made out of him. Sir, please forgive me. You seem to be my dad's age. - Forgive this child... - Hey, get off! You? A child? How much do you eat every day? Look at his bulging belly. I'll make sure he goes to jail. All the evidence is against him. Let's go. - Come on. See you in court. - Sir, please… What evidence are you talking about? Who are you? Have you read the case file? - Let me read it for you. - Hey... - Listen… - Hey! Exhibit 11. This seizure memo only says that the police seized 30 fake iPad boxes from my friend's shop. Yes, it's still a crime to steal fake iPads. Yes, but in the seizure memo, it doesn't say fake iPads were found, it says fake iPad boxes were found! My friend is a scrap dealer. You only get empty boxes at a scrap dealer's shop. This is not a case of cheating. Is he right? Agree for an out-of-court settlement quietly, or there will only be empty boxes in the court. Let's go, man! Is he right? Listen, sir! I agree that my friend has a bulging belly, but he eats his bread with dignity! Two weeks?! But you were going to Mumbai for three days! Yes, for the college reunion. But then, I'll go straight to Dubai. So, you're going to miss my project opening next week? - Why the Dubai plan all of a sudden? - It's my mom's tenth wedding anniversary. I haven't seen her in four years. She wouldn't be expecting it. It'll be a nice surprise for her. You should also come with me. We could tell her about us. What? Doesn't your mom know about us? Of course, she doesn't. She sends me photos of guys every day. Marriage prospects, you know? See… this is today's photo, a doctor. Really? Wow! Heart surgeon in Australia! - Wow! Impressive! - Arjun... But he looks a bit old, and he's bald. You deserve better, Jahnvi. - Give me my phone. - Listen to me. One minute. Next one, an investment banker in Canada. He's a banker, he's boring. No magic... - Arjun, give me my phone! - Wait. Check this one out. Rehaan Khan, aspiring actor. His hobbies are cooking, traveling, and movies. Jahnvi, movies! He is the one. You should marry him. Wait, Jahnvi. If you don't like this guy, we'll find someone else! You put the lawyer in his place! You're amazing! Cheating, fraud… I even got to see your lawyer personality today. Where did you learn all this? Are you praising me or dissing me? I'm praising you, brother. These days, people hesitate to help others. You're my God, you know? Nobody can harm me as long as you are with me. Whom do you work for? Your wife. You're barking up the wrong tree. I did exactly as your wife said. Ronnie! We are in trouble because of the ATM incident! Hey, buddy. Give me a puff. Oh, it's you! You got fooled so badly the other day. Do you know about a split tongue? The tongue keeps working even when it's split into two. It's obvious that you've taken it personally. You should've done your homework before messing with me. Do you see this price tag? It's approved and certified throughout Delhi. I will sell his assets one by one and recover my money. I'll even sell this fat for interest! Is that okay? Why are you looking at me? Get him! You… You scoundrel! Chaddi! Chaddi? Chaddi! Chaddi! Chaddi. Chaddi. I'm giving you seven days. You said 20 lakhs, so now, you'll have to give me the entire 20. Why just 20? For Chaddi, I'll give you 25. Really? You've said it, so consider it done. - Oh, my! - My back! We're in trouble, Ronnie! How do we arrange 25 lakhs? Can I help you with that, ma'am? What are you doing here? Are you coming? - Thank you! - What… Hey, relax. I am not coming with you, I just came to walk you to the gate. What? Why? I wanted to talk to you. Come on. Tell me now. I don't like that earthen cup of tea. I hate it. It feels like dirt in my mouth. And those foreign movies that you take me to… I find them boring. How do you watch them? Ever since you showed me those marriage prospects… I've been thinking that maybe there is someone better for you. You know that magic… we don't have that made-for-each-other feel. Did you come all the way just to say these things? There was no need to come here with your sad face! Let me finish… I feel at home only with you. So the question is… will you let me be at home forever? I love you. I love you. Listen, I bought a ring for you, but I lost it on the way. I wanted this to be perfect! It's okay. Give it to me when I return. But make sure to ask the right question. Last chance to board the flight. Think about it. - Bye. - Bye. Staring doesn't change fate, or the cards. I'm not staring, I'm just keeping an eye. Come on, show us. Hey, wait! Give it to the rickshaw driver. - What now? - Auto! I told you you'd lose my two lakh rupees as well. I don't want to interfere with Lakhani's matter. You guys better return the money, because it's mine. The fatso got lucky. I almost had him this time. Shut up, dude! We are the ones in trouble. We've lost everything we had… and you're only concerned about yourself. Chaddi? Chaddi! Hero, you've lost the money. Shall we start searching for ways to exact it in the meantime? We still have two days left. What were you so busy with for the past five days? Are you planning to beg for money in these two days? You have a problem with me. Yes, since you're not afraid for your own life, I thought you would worry about your friend's. Give me the money in two days, or you'll get your friend in pieces. Got it? Hang up now! - Surprise! - Surprise! Guys! All the units at Fifth Avenue Condos have been booked in just 48 hours! Here's to the man of the hour, Arjun! Thank you, guys, but the credit goes to all of us. So, here's to all of us. Cheers! Yes, brother. - Can you arrange for some money? - Buddy, it will take me a week. Check your safe once. You should've asked sooner. I made a payment just now. - I'll return it in a couple of days. - What will you pledge as security? My business hasn't been doing well. Why don't you ask Titoo? Why did you have to mess with Lakhani? No one will give you money. I'm sorry. Bro, I'm leaving. What? It's your party, man. I have an important registry in the morning. You continue and make sure that everyone gets home drunk. - Cool? - Okay. - See you, bye. - Bye. - Bye, guys. - Bye. - Bye. - Bye. Put him in the storeroom. Sir, are they twins? Their names are different. One is Sehgal, and the other is Rana. WELCOME TO VANSANT NAGAR POLICE STATION - Hey, Biju! - Yes, Dhiru? - Can you come to the station? - Right now? Yes, now. Hurry up. Where were you on the night of the 2nd? Chaddi... She didn't ask what you were wearing. Where were you? Chaddi... Let me finish speaking. Chaddi is my friend's name. I was at his shop. Write down the address. Chimanlal Electronics, shop no. 39, Gaffar Market. Phone no. 98211096. Hey, brother... You have a weird taste… carrying a ladies' handkerchief?! Should we bring some lipstick and makeup too? Send this to the lab for a DNA test. How do you know Aakash Sardana? Is he your husband? Hey! Give a straight answer, or... Or what? She'll hit me? Aren't you running your mouth! DK Basu versus the State of West Bengal! Rules laid down by the Supreme Court prevent custodial abuse of criminals and suspects. What did he say? Physically assaulting anyone in custody is a criminal offense. You… Ramsagar Yadav versus the State of UP. A person subject to violence in custody finds no witnesses barring policemen who have a bond of brotherhood. In such situations, not only the assailant but all the officers on duty at the station will be considered accomplices to the crime! He sounds like a lawyer. We are going to get in trouble. Rathi, beat him up. Gupta, beat him. Oh, come on! You... Nilabati Behera versus the State of Odisha. If any mark of injury is found on the suspect's body during police custody, then he is entitled to compensation. You all will be suspended, while I get a compensation of two to four lakhs. Can I get another handkerchief? VASANT NAGAR POLICE STATION What happened, Dhiru? Come, I'll show you. - Do you remember Arjun Sehgal? - Yes. He is the prime suspect in a murder case. We've recovered a photo of him from the crime scene. Wow, you got lucky. Let's have a drink. Wait until you see the complete picture. Come on. He is his carbon copy. Do you understand my problem now? This photo is of no use now. I know that, Biju. Give me a solution. You're the lawyer. You know I've been looking for a chance to get back at Arjun for eight years. I'll retire in two months. I think now is the chance. It's better to retire with respect than to get suspended for something foolish. Damn! Biju… try to understand. Find a way out. Who caught the other suspect? The Border Police Station. Why? That means they already have a record of his arrest. Here's what we'll do. Delete the entry of Arjun's arrest, so there won't be any record of him coming here. Then what? Look, Friday is over, and the court is closed on Saturday and Sunday. The magistrates take complaints on the weekend, but I'll handle it. If we go to court without evidence, their bail will be confirmed. So, you have time until Monday morning. Bring any evidence you can find against Arjun in these two days. Just two days. Who do you think is the killer, ma'am? Arjun or Sooraj? - I wasn't feeling well. - You know… - he hardly knew anyone here. - I don't know Aakash. It's a sharp and pointed object… It wasn't an Uber or Ola, so I don't have any details. - The Border Patrol caught him… - Ma'am, the ACP is calling you. One murder, and two suspects, who are lookalikes. They must appear in court on Monday, which means we just have Saturday and Sunday to find out whether it's Arjun or Sooraj in this photo. Rathi, make sure they don't meet anyone from outside. Gupta, don't give them anything to eat or drink until they tell the truth. - Yes, sir. - And the most important thing… they shouldn't find out about each other. Otherwise, the case will get further complicated. - Do you understand? - Yes, sir! Let's go. Take your clothes off. Take your clothes off. How did you get this injury? I scraped against an iron rod at the construction site. Take your clothes off. Hey, don't get too cocky. Remove your shirt first. How did you get this injury? I was riding my bike after getting drunk and lost control. Match the injury photos with the murder weapon's profile. Yes, ma'am. Ms. Shivani, how are you? How is everyone at home? It would be nice to hear from you every now and then. Did you take a look at the crime scene photos? You're talking about work again. I haven't seen the photos yet, but I am presenting something even better for you! We found a hair sample on the victim, Aakash Sardana's fingernails… and the DNA from that sample doesn't match any of Aakash's known contacts. - So, it could be the murderer's DNA! - Yes. Send me the DNA samples of the suspects. I'll solve the case in two minutes and get you a distinguished service medal. Have you lost your mind? The samples were sent long ago. I haven't received any sample, ma'am. Where will you take me after I get there? I'll definitely take you for a stroll. Trust me. Sorry, ma'am. I'm leaving right now. Mr. Chhaba, I'm sending them now, and I need the results today. Why is he barking at both of them? He's trained, right? I don't know, sir. Either the samples have been tampered with, or he is detecting the scent on both suspects. Mr. Rathi, we need to find a connection between these two and Aakash. Meet me at Aakash's house in one hour. Do you know him? No, ma'am. Have you heard the names Arjun Sehgal and Sooraj Rana? No, ma'am. Have you seen him? - No, sir. - Here… Let's go. Do you know this person? - No, ma'am. Is it him? - It's possible. We're still looking into it. Have you heard the names Arjun Sehgal and Sooraj Rana? Sooraj Rana… No. If I find anything, I'll let you know. I'm seeing this person for the first time. What happened, ma'am? There was a murder on Wednesday at midnight. I have the killer's photo as well. You know him, don't you? Ronnie? Murder?! No, ma'am! It can't be! Murder... We got drunk and passed out here on Wednesday night. It was our celebration week. What were you celebrating? Speak up! Well, I had almost lost my shop… but Ronnie saved it. How? Did he give you money? How would he have any money? He helped me win a case in court. He came up with a few points that left the lawyer dazed. Ma'am, we inquired the neighbors. They say these two are frauds. They mostly work outside the city. Not at all trustworthy. Oh, come on… How long have you known him? Answer her quickly! For two years, ma'am. What did he do before that? I don't know, ma'am. We never talked about it. - Did you notice something, Mr. Rathi? - What? He was quite chirpy while praising his friend, but he started stuttering when we mentioned the murder. Keep an eye on him. He shouldn't leave the city. Okay. Yes, ma'am. - Yes, Bhalla. Did you find anything? - Yes, ma'am. This is the movement of Aakash's phone for the whole month, and this is Arjun's. There is no intersection between the two. Ronnie and Chaddi's mobiles are registered under someone else's name, and they are using a week-old SIM card. There is no connection established yet. Found anything on Facebook, Instagram, or any other social media? No, ma'am. We checked their emails too, but found nothing. Arjun mentioned his alibi location. Yes, ma'am, Noor Manzil Road. We have the footage. This is the in-time of the car… and this is the out-time. So, clearly, the car was on Noor Manzil Road for about three hours. The whole day went by, but you guys haven't found any evidence yet! Where are the DNA and forensic reports? Will someone speak up? Sir, we just received an update from the lab. They need some time to send the forensic reports. The money trail indicates theft as the motive. Oh, spare us your academic knowledge, Ms. Mathur! You won't be able to do it. Kesla! Hey, speak up! - Did he say anything? - Sir, nothing yet. I'm giving you one last chance. Why did you kill Aakash? I didn't kill Aakash. - You… - Kesla, wait. You've cooked up a nice story. You are the one cooking up stories. I am speaking the truth. But just the last time, you will fail. How dare you… Mr. Rathi, bring the keys to Arjun's car. Look. We can do this all night. It's in your best interest to confess. No matter how much you beat me… I won't make a false confession! Damn you! This is broken. My jack was broken. Arjun is telling the truth. Let's go. According to Section 42... Yes, I know. But this method leaves no trace. Go ahead, file a complaint. Why were you leaving the city last night? Why? Is leaving the city a crime? On the night of the murder, you were found drunk in Gaffar Market, and your friend is the only witness. Ma'am, if you don't trust me, then you can trace my phone location. Go ahead, do that. Someone who knows that phone locations can be traced wouldn't carry his phone while going to commit a murder. This is your last chance. - Got anything to say in your defense? - I am a human being, after all. How many times do I have to prove my innocence? - Sir. - At Kanchan Jewelers… Cross-check this information. Mr. Rathi, come in. Sit. Why was Arjun saying that the ACP is trying to frame him? Ma'am… It's a personal matter, ma'am. Eight years ago, the ACP's daughter eloped with a boy. The boy was from a different caste, and the ACP is very strict when it comes to caste. The friend who helped them run away was… - Arjun? - Yes, ma'am. The ACP and his lawyer friend framed him. They filed a kidnapping case claiming that the girl was a minor, and that the boy abducted her with Arjun's help. But the ACP's daughter turned out to be brave and testified in favor of Arjun in court. The highlight is that the ACP still doesn't know where his daughter is. He only wanted a chance to get back at Arjun. He's got that chance now, so he won't spare him. Hello. Aakash's murder case is solved, Ms. Shivani. We have a DNA match! The murderer is already in your custody. Whose DNA is it? Arjun's or Sooraj's? These are two samples, from two different people?! Yes. Two different suspects. Ma'am, you need to come to the lab right away. This isn't something we can explain over the phone. Hey, get up now. Here's some water, drink it. Hey, get up. The police station looks deserted in the morning. Come, sit here. Stay put until I get back! Come on, get up now. Get up, come on. Rathi, catch him! Hey! Ma'am, this DNA was found at your crime scene… and this is sample no. 1, which you sent us later on. Perfect match! So, it's Ronnie. What's the problem? This is sample no. 2. This is also a perfect match! What? Ma'am, the most surprising thing is the samples match 100 percent with each other. How is that possible? Nobody's DNA is a 100 percent match, not even a father's and a son's. There's one case in which the DNA matches perfectly, ma'am. In the case of identical twins. - Hey, bring him. - Take him there. Take him there! Hey, come on. - Come. - Get out. - Bring it on! - Lock him up. Get lost! Sir, what is the issue here? Do they know each other? - Let me call Ms. Shivani... - No! Let's call the ACP. Are your suspects identical twins? Sooraj and I are twins. We are twins… but not brothers! So, there's no scientific way to establish which of the two is the murderer. There's one thing that's different even in the case of identical twins. Fingerprints! We've already checked the crime scene... Ma'am, you know how the police team checks the crime scene. Let me send my team over to check again. Even if we get half a fingerprint, the case will be solved. You guys, go and check the living room, and you guys, check upstairs. Come on, guys, quick! Checking here for fingerprints again? We won't find anything. Hey, love, how are you? I'm visiting Delhi in two days. Keep yourself free. What? You're coming?! Listen, give me a kiss for now. - Hey, what happened? - Just a minute! - Just one... - Hey, where did you go? Did you go out of network coverage? Let me go outside. Hold on. This is better. Hey, there's nothing here. Go inside. Yes… this is good. - Great! - Got it. Good coverage... Don't try my patience, I won't call you again. Don't feel bad, I'll give you a small teaser. - You'll always remember this. - Mr. Gupta! Yes, ma'am? - What's happening? - Nothing, ma'am. If you're done, then let's do some work. Yes, ma'am. Nothing's matching, ma'am. Everything was going well at home. We were a happy middle-class family. But when Sooraj and I were eight years old, mom and dad started having problems. Nothing was going well. They never got along. - Arjun, wear your shirt. - Yes. Mom, did you pay for the field trip? We have to go next Sunday. - Yes, I... - This month's budget is a bit tight. Make some adjustments. Mom, are you sure you'll pay for it? Yes, I will pay for it. Come on, wear your shirt. It was mom who kept the family together. Really? We've heard that your mom was a notorious gambler. - He said that?! - Hey! I'll kill that scoundrel! How dare he talk about mom like that! Hey, sit down! - Okay. - Move it. I've heard of gambling fathers… but this is the first time I'm hearing of a gambling mother. So what if she had a weakness? Does that make her a bad mother? Don't you guys take bribes? Don't you buy toys for your children with that money? Are you all bad fathers? Sooraj! Arjun! When she won, we would get football jerseys, books, and video games. I'm sure he didn't tell you that. She was the topper of her university and had a job in a bank. But dad didn't want her to work. Dad wanted her to take care of us, that's all. Gambling again? Everyone gossips about us. What does it matter? I do all this for my family. I do it for my children. You only think about yourself! You're selfish! Stop all this and pay some attention to the kids. All my attention is on the kids! You don't need to tell me that! If you were paying attention, you wouldn't be so late! It's called ludo-mania. An addiction to gambling! It is a mental illness. She needed help and understanding, not disapproval. Is this how you pay attention? Have you seen the report cards? And what is this? You've spoiled him. One is a topper, and the other... Learn something from Arjun. Why are you looking at her? There's nothing worth learning. Let's go, Arjun. Mom… why does dad love Arjun more than me? It's not like that. How can he love his left eye more than his right eye? He loves both of you. He wants both of you to do well. Okay? But things began to worsen gradually. Finally, dad filed for divorce and took custody of both of us through the court. He proved to the court that our future wasn't safe with our mother. Instead of helping her, he threw her out of the house. Mom! Please don't go. Mom! Mom would still meet us. It's my birthday today. Come over in the evening. Sooraj! - Mom! - Arjun! - Happy birthday, my child. - Thank you. Happy birthday. I've got your favorite chocolate cake. There's a McDonald's nearby. - Let's get Happy Meals! - Yes, Mom! Yes! Mom, can we just cut the cake here? We can't go to McDonald's. Why? Why can't we go, Arjun? Dad has planned a birthday celebration at home. He won't like it. Let's just tell dad that we missed the bus. He's taken a leave from the office today. He'll be waiting. But Mom... It's okay, don't fight. We'll get Happy Meals next time. Okay, Arjun? Let's cut the cake now. Okay? Mom, why did you bring a gift for him? Why do you love him? He doesn't love you back, don't you see it? - I'll go home and... - Hey! Sooraj, Arjun is your brother. Just as you think about me, he thinks about your dad. So, don't be mad, okay? Now, cheer up. I told you to stay away from the kids! Don't you understand? It's their birthday, Ravi. You won't understand so easily. Dad got a permanent restraining order against mom. So that she wouldn't meet us no matter how she felt. But she was still our mom. She would obviously suffer. And she did. Ravi, please let me talk to them. I'm begging you. I'm missing them very much. I understand, but the kids are sleeping right now. Ravi, I'm feeling lonely, and I have this weird feeling… Ravi, let me talk to my kids once. You want to talk to them in this state? Do you want them to start hating you? Do you want them to know that their mom is a drunkard? I haven't been drinking, Ravi. I'm just... Just once, let me talk to my kids. If I just hear their voices, I'll be able to sleep. Just once. Fine, call them in the morning when you're sober. Ravi, please don't hang up! Ravi... She couldn't bear the pain until morning. Sooraj changed since that day. Sooraj, let's go home. Dad is calling us. Go ahead, I'll take a while. He'd get aggressive over small things. - Come home. - Hey! - He'd fight with me over little things. - Listen to me! Come on, go! - You don't understand... - I told you to go! What's your problem? Year after year, those fights and problems kept getting worse. Stop it! Hey! - You… - Dad tried… Stop it, Sooraj! …but the situation was getting out of hand. - Hey, stop! - Sooraj, stop it! He started blaming himself for Sooraj's condition and our fights. Sooraj, stop it! - Arjun, step back! Enough, stop it! - Tell him! Sooraj, stop it! I wish you were dead instead of mom! What did he say? That I used to fight and beat people up? He's a liar, in fact, he's always been a liar. He is very good at manipulating people. I am not a liar, he is. We had to send him for psychiatric treatment. If you don't trust me, call Delhi Psych Ward and ask them who was admitted there for a year. Your case will be solved right there. Go ahead, ask them… why he was admitted there when he was 15 years old. They will tell you how he jabbed a pen into the doctor's neck. The doctor almost died. Sir, these two are crazy. Dr. Lagwal no longer works here, ma'am. I will get his number for you, but the incident with the pen you mentioned is quite famous. Actually, Dr. Lagwal was strict with both of them. One day, one of the brothers lost his mind and jabbed the doctor in the neck with a pen. - I'm telling you… - Hey! Govind! Get him out of here! Remember, no one will come to save you next time. What do you mean by one of them? Were both of them there? Yes, ma'am. They were admitted here for a year. Who attacked the doctor? That is a mystery, ma'am. No one knows. Not even Dr. Lagwal knows who attacked him. Why did you lie that it was just your brother who was in the psych ward? I did not say that I was not there. The point is that he was undergoing treatment, he had anger issues, and I got stuck. He is the one who attacked the doctor. Good! He is lying, and you are falling for it! Go on. I went to college, and Sooraj left home without telling anyone. He got involved in useless activities. He used to steal money from home to gamble. And I don't know why, but he used to steal dad's law books too. My life was going well after my dad passed away. My career, love life… I was successful. Sooraj could not tolerate that. He was always jealous of my success. He always tried to prove that he was better than me. And if he couldn't, he would create problems in my life. He had just one obsession in his life… me. I met him four days after dad's death. That was the last time I saw him. He is lying again! He visited my house just a few days ago. Are you sure you didn't lose the ring? This is not the first time. I know he stole my ring. I won't spare him this time. Relax, sit down. Sit. Calm down, listen. Your project is opening up next week. Focus on your work. I will handle him. Hit him! Harder! Brother, they are beating him black and blue. Had he stolen it, he would have confessed by now. Your goons have beaten me up a lot. I didn't count… because I will only hit once, and it'll hurt you forever. Remember that, Arjun. I should have understood it sooner. He is getting revenge for that day. Yes, I threatened him. So what? Will you consider a threat as evidence? What will you say in court? That I threatened my brother a few days ago, so I must have committed the murder too? Have you ever been to court? I know it's you who committed the murder. Ma'am, the ACP is calling you. Sir! Don't believe everything Arjun says. He's not as straightforward as he seems. Sir, honestly, I suspect Ronnie. He's lying. So, Arjun's telling the truth? Does it mean that at the time of the murder, Arjun was changing the tire of his car for three hours? Ronnie has only one witness, his friend. Arjun has nothing. Ronnie clearly made a threat a few days ago. You heard what he said. Mathur, if Arjun was innocent, he wouldn't try to run away. Ronnie was trying to flee the city when he was arrested. - I don't think Arjun... - Enough with this Arjun talk! If you're so confident that Arjun is innocent, bring some evidence before the night ends. Otherwise, forget about saving him. I'm not trying to save him, sir. But I don't know why you're trying to prove him guilty. What am I missing? Should be right in front of my eyes. Did you find anything from the Taxi Union? Nothing yet, ma'am. Bring Ronnie's friend, Chaddi, here. Put him under pressure. Maybe he will confess something. If the police ask you anything, just tell them what I've told you. Police? And if they visit again, leave the city before they catch you. Brother, you'll get me trapped again! Ma'am, Chaddi is missing. - What? - Ma'am, the shop is closed, and his phone is switched off. We searched his home too, but we didn't find him. I told you to keep an eye on him, didn't I? - Sorry, ma'am. - You had one job! Go and find him! Ma'am, Ronnie was under a debt of 20 lakhs until the night of the murder… which he paid the morning after the murder. Oh, wow! Whom did you rob? Where is Chaddi? The ACP got this information from a source three hours ago, but he told us not to inform you. I knew it! What's going on here? Where is Ronnie? What's this? On the night of the murder, there was a theft of jewellery worth lakhs. Nobody has been caught yet. Come, help a little at the counter. Why? What do you mean? An amount of 20 lakhs was missing from Aakash Sardana's house, and you paid your debt of 20 lakhs in one go the morning after the murder. If I write this in the charge sheet, you will be charged under Section 302. You will serve 14 years in jail and waste away your youth. That's why just put your fingerprints as per my instructions. At most, it will be a case of theft, 401, 402, and 442. Just four years. I will get you out in two years for good behavior. I'm sure you know this much about law. Tell me if I'm wrong. No, sir. You are right. There is just a small problem. I didn't loot the money to pay off my debt. I won it by playing cards. And that, too, on the night of the murder. At Mr. Bhatia's house, in Punjabi Bagh. I was there all night. You can check. If you were gambling that night, why didn't you say it earlier? Section Four, Public Gambling Act, sir. It carries a penalty of one week to one month, and a fine of Rs. 200. I was afraid. Tell me if I'm wrong. He says he was at your house on the 2nd, gambling with you. Yes, he was here. In the beginning, he was losing. But suddenly, I think his stars aligned. He played all night. He took away the entire 25 lakhs from the table. Will you say this in court? Yes, of course. Okay, you may go. Hey, unlock his handcuffs and let him go. - The case is closed, let's go. - Sir! Aakash's murder case is solved, sir! Wow, Mr. Gupta! This is breaking news! - Sir… - I know the case is solved. Arjun Sehgal is the murderer. No, sir. Arjun Sehgal didn't commit the murder. Ms. Shivani called, we have evidence! Yes, Mathur? Radhika Yadav Valmiki is here to give her statement. - What's her connection to this case? - There's a connection, sir. Arjun visited their house in East Delhi that day. - Who brought her here? - I called her, sir. There is something you haven't answered yet. Why did you lie to your colleagues that you were going for registration in the morning? I can't tell you. It's a matter of someone's safety. I guarantee the safety. 96692056… The ACP's daughter. We needed some money. So, Arjun came to our house to give the same. This is about the next morning, Mathur. The murder happened the previous night, when Sooraj was playing cards in Punjabi Bagh, meaning he wasn't at the crime scene. Arjun wasn't there either. The taxi driver who helped Arjun on Noor Manzil Road that night was out of town for two days. He returned today. His statement matches exactly with Arjun's statement. Yes, sir. All this evidence is circumstantial. You will not get an extension. The court will decide what needs to be done. CG-2005 Arjun Sehgal and Sooraj Rana versus The State. One of you is the murderer, and there is no doubt about that. But even after six months of court proceedings and several adjournments, the prosecution could not prove which one of them is the murderer. But Your Honor... The police department should be ashamed of their investigation in this case. It's a blot on the working of the police department. Knowing that one of them is guilty, we cannot punish them both. Our law does not allow us to do so. The court wants to punish the guilty, but our justice system works on the basis of evidence. Even if 100 criminals go Scot-free, an innocent should not be punished. That's the foundation of our legal system. So, with all the evidence presented in front of this court, I have no option but to declare both the accused not guilty. Arjun Sehgal and Sooraj Rana… you are both free to go. Thank you, ma'am. Thank you so much for all your help. I must tell you, without your help, I wouldn't have been able to escape from him. It's been, you know… Sir, we have seen many culprits go Scot-free, but it's the first time we don't know who the murderer is. Ma'am, he asked me to hand over all these old cases to you. Yes? Jahnvi Behl? She doesn't live here anymore. Arjun and Jahnvi were quite serious about each other, but when she went to Mumbai for her reunion, I started receiving random messages from her all of a sudden. What kind of messages? That she's now with someone else. That she's going to marry him. She asked me to tell Arjun to move on. I even showed all those messages to Arjun. I don't believe it, Divya. Something's fishy. Jahnvi would never do this. Arjun, everyone saw Jahnvi leaving the party with him. With whom? I'll find out. I informed Arjun as soon as I found out. Her ex-boyfriend from college. - Aakash Sardana? - Yes, ma'am. Where's Jahnvi? - What did you do to her? - Please let me go! - Tell me! - I'll tell you! I didn't know that you were with Jahnvi. We loved each other. We were going to get married. Trust me, please. I am telling the truth. She was going to tell you everything after returning from Dubai. I really love her. But that bitch only wanted you! Want to know where Jahnvi is and what I did to her? Here you go! I met her at the reunion party. I spiked her drink. Then I took her to a hotel and did everything I wanted to. I kept giving her drugs… and did as I pleased. She tried hard to stop me. But she couldn't handle so many drugs. I just wanted to hear her say my name. Say it, tell me you love me. She went on saying your name. Arjun… Say you love Aakash! Until her last breath, she thought you would come to save her! I paid 20 lakhs and covered up everything. Arjun and Sooraj Sehgal. Ma'am, how can I forget them? You… They fought with each other like dogs. But they had an amazing connection. Whenever a third person came between them… No one will come to save you next time! …they would forget their differences and face the problem like a team. When I first saw you at the police station, I thought you were going to create a new problem. But when you... Remember Dr. Lagwal? Same formula. It's impossible that something is happening in your life, and I don't know about it. Everything was going well, and Jahnvi disappeared all of a sudden. When I found out about Aakash's murder, I thought of asking you. But you got arrested before I could reach your office. Come to the Sector 30 police station for routine questioning. Bloody idiot! You erased the evidence of the murder and thought you'd get away with it. I know these policemen very well. They sniff out every piece of evidence at the crime scene. So, in order to mislead them… Why is he barking at both of them? When I started following the investigation, I found out that ACP Yadav was involved in the case. Your old enemy. That's when I made a plan to get inside. The ACP had a grudge against you. He wasn't going to let you go. I'll make sure you spend your whole life in jail. That's why I put the ACP aside and focused on Shivani. I created such stories one after the other that made Shivani suspicious of me. Take your shirt off. I lost control of the bike. He played me! What happened, ma'am? What if Shivani had not helped me? She was bound to help you. I know you're the murderer. And no matter what, I will save Arjun. When I was sure the plan had worked, I told the ACP everything. If you were gambling that night, why didn't you say it sooner? What if Shivani finds out about this game? She must have figured it out by now. She's a smart girl. She made a big mistake because of her smartness. She created false evidence in order to save you. Arjun Sehgal didn't commit the murder. Ms. Shivani called. We have evidence. The taxi driver who helped Arjun on Noor Manzil Road that night… his statement matches exactly with Arjun's statement. She can't do anything now even if she wishes to. Any other questions? Why did you do it? For mom. Arjun is your brother, Sooraj. Although your dad and I are not together, you two have to be together forever. Remember this, Sooraj. She loved you. Maybe more than she loved me. If she were alive, this is what she would've wanted. I did it for her, not for you. What now? That's it now. This was the biggest gamble of my life, and it's over now. I'm moving on from all of this. What about you? After Jahnvi, there's nothing left for me here. I'm leaving everything behind. I am leaving the house in your hands. We might never meet again. We fight for each other But are never together Listen, kind man, we are the same Listen, kind man, we are the same I'm the story And you are the main character Listen, kind man, we are the same Oh, kind man Oh, kind man
