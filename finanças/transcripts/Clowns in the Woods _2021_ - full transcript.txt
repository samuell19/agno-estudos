67, 68, 69. My favorite fucking number. You guys got a front row seat to the gun show. Guys, you know, this place is a historical landmark, right? Why don't you go explore it? Maybe take a hike just a little fucking bit. Yeah, Zack, don't you need history to graduate? I got your historical landmark right here in my fucking pants, all right. This here cock and balls is a national fucking treasure. Got that. Let's go. All right, we'll let you guys play boyfriend and girlfriend. Historical landmark? It got us alone, didn't it? - Hey Brad? - What's up? Why is this place called Legacy Park? Shit, who cares? Nothing happens in Donville anyway. - It's fucking dead end. - I know. That's why I was asking. Honestly, who cares about the fucking past? - What's up? - I gotta pee. Don't worry, I won't fall in. Whatever. Fuck. What's up, Brad? Where'd she go? Did you gross her out or something? Small dick? What's the problem? I thought I told you to fucking take a hike. Dude, there's nothing to fucking do here, all right. We've been playing faggot Frisbee for a half an hour. Yeah, this place sucks, bro. - Like your mom. - Like your mom. There's nowhere else to go. Even when we get our degrees, we're still gonna be in the same spot, stuck here. No shit. Hey, Zack are you even graduating this year? Yeah, I'm fucking graduating. Why don't you mind your own fucking business, Jerry? Jesus Christ. What is this, your fucking 10th year? Yeah, I know. What are you like 30 now? Do you wanna know how old I am? I'm old enough for your mom to call me fucking daddy. How about that? Oh! I don't know what you're laughing about, Jerry. Your mom takes it up the tailpipe like a champ too. This dude never has a serious answer. I speak the truth, all right. He always talks about his dick. Can I get a witness? - Hey Liz. - Marcus. What are you doing here? I always come here. Okay and what do you want? Well, my birthday is coming up tomorrow and I was wondering if you wanted to come. What's this? It's my birthday invitation. It has clowns on it. Why clowns? Clowns are my favorite. What the fuck do you think you're doing around my girl, retard? Look at you, Marcus. Looking like the motherfucking Kool-Aid man. Yeah, big man, huh? Unlock me some Kool-Aid. Don't you like Kool-Aid? Atomic nuggie. I asked you a question, Tubby. I was only asking Liz if she wanted to celebrate my birthday tomorrow. Yeah, bullshit. You were probably peeping on her taking a piss, - weren't you, you fat retard? - Right. Leave him alone, Brad. Stay out of this, Liz. This is only a taste, you keep on fucking with my girl. You got it? This is your last warning. That's right, choke on the motherfucking ground. Keep your face in the fucking dirt, retard. That's where it belongs. Are you shitting me? Get the fuck outta here. Are you jealous, Brad? Yeah, there's all kinds of fucking freaks around here. - I have to protect you. - My hero. Who's there? Show yourself. How could you treat me like this? Treating you, how is this my fault? I'm the one being stood up all the time while you drive out to God knows where. This is my final year of grad school. I got research to do. You knew this when we started dating. Where are you going? I can't take it anymore. You don't wanna be seen with me. You don't even want your own mother to know about us. My mother isn't even, I don't even talk to my mother anymore. Why do you think that is? - She doesn't approve. - Oh, so that's my fault too. No, it's just... Not now, Marcus, okay? Jesus, Amy, you can't even focus on me for two seconds. Honey, Marcus is okay, - he's just- - I don't care. I don't care. You're no better than those kids who go to local college. Kelly, what are you talking about? Go back to your research, Amy, and get your graduate degree. Until then, it's over. - I love you. - It's over. - No, I love- - Get off me, Amy. Come back here. Is there some kind of problem here? No, Mr. Belson. You know, I can't evict you for being deviants, and I wish I could, but I can evict you for causing a disturbance. Leave her alone. Or else what? Gonna have my rent next month, boy? I always pay on time, Mr. Belson. My brother gives me some money- - And the rest comes from public support. I've heard it before. You know, I'm a taxpayer and I have to sit back and wait for my own tax money to come back to me. Funny, isn't it? As for you, I'm hoping I don't see you bring her kind around here again, unless I can watch. Have a nice day. You sick fuck. - Hi Marcus. - Hi. Dan. How are you? I'm good, Marcus. How are you? Okay, I guess. How's my sister doing? I think I saw her break up with her girlfriend. Oh no. Well, they've broken up before. Maybe it'll work out. Yeah, yeah maybe. So what else is new? I just wanted to talk, that's all. Really? What's wrong, Marcus? What's the matter? That guy, Brad, beat me up again. That guy you told me about? Aw, man, I'm sorry. I asked Liz if she wanted to celebrate my birthday with me tomorrow and he didn't like that. Hey man, she's not your friend. I'm your friend. You should invite me. But you live too far away. I'm gonna be in town for a week. I'll be staying with my sister. Maybe we can have your birthday then. Oh wow, that'd be great. Things can be tough, Marcus, I know. I live with my mom and her boyfriend and it's no fun. But soon me, you, and my sister, we can all hang out together. I'd like that, Dan. Hey, Marcus, I'm watching wrestling right now. Can we talk later? Oh sure, give me a call later. Will do. Thanks for calling, buddy. Say hi to my sister for me. And don't worry about the bad people. Think about the good people. Okay, bye Dan. Esposito's Circus. For Marcus. We see your pain and feel your suffering, for helping people with special needs, like you, is in our nature. All that needs to be done now is your sacrifice that is to come, then your revenge will be served upon them. Marcus, it's me. Can I come in? Just a second. Yes, Amy? Hi, is it okay if we hang out for a little bit? Sure, Amy. Come on in. I need a hug. You okay, Amy? Yeah. Are you okay? You looked really upset when I saw you come in. It was Brian and his shithead classmates again, wasn't it? They didn't hurt you, did they? I swear to God, next time I see them, I'm gonna make sure they shit their balls out. Amy, please I don't want anymore trouble. Hey, come on, this has been going on long enough. You just want them to continue stepping on you? It wasn't completely their fault. I asked Liz if she wanted to celebrate my birthday with me tomorrow. And you thought she would agree? Marcus, listen, Liz doesn't care about you. Besides, she has that asshole Brad, as her boyfriend. I know. I just wanna have friends to celebrate my birthday with me tomorrow. I'm your friend. That bitch and that crowd she hangs out with spits on people with disabilities like you. I'll tell you what? How 'bout tomorrow we go shopping and I'll buy your favorite cake you like? How does that sound? Peanut butter and chocolate? You got it. Hey, do you wanna have dinner with me? - Tomorrow? - Tonight? Oh, I would love that. Let me just go lock the door. Okay. Oh, and Dan says hi. You know what? Tell him I said hi and we'll see him soon. - Okay. - Okay, I'll be right back. Okay. Hi, Marcus. Wait, Marcus, hold on. Let me explain. What do you want, Liz? I'm really sorry about what Brad put you through. In fact, I'm no longer his girlfriend because of it. So, what does that mean between us? It means I'm willing to celebrate your birthday tomorrow. Oh, wow, that's great. Could it be at my place? Sure, but I don't know where you live. Here's the address. Wow, thank you, Liz. So, my place tomorrow, 8:00. - Sound good? - Sounds good. All right, don't be late. I won't. Marcus, we need to talk. Uh, about what? You still think that Liz wants to be your friend? Can't you see she's gonna manipulate you and hurt you? Oh, you don't know what you're talking about. Yes, I do. That bitch doesn't care about you. All she wants to do is hurt you. Oh, whatever. No wonder your girlfriend dumped you. You know what, fine. I can't protect you anymore. You make your own mistakes. Who is it? It's me, Marcus. Come right in. The door's open. Hi, Liz. This is a nice place you've got there. Thanks, come sit down. Okay. Thanks again for inviting me. You know why I asked you here? No, but I would like to know. Fine, come closer. Okay. Well, since it's your birthday, I want you to kiss me. - Uh, are you sure? - I'm sure. - Close your eyes. - Okay. Now. Happy birthday, retard. I can't believe you're kissing the dog. Hi, buddy. I can't believe you kissed a dog. - What's wrong? - Happy birthday, Marcus. You don't wanna lose your virginity to a dog? Run home to mommy, Maybe she'll bake you a fucking cake. ... run out on her? Fatty. Shit, Marcus. - Is he fucking dead? - What the fuck, man? - Marcus. - Marcus. - Retard. - Marcus, wake up. Dude, he's fucking dead. He's fucking dead. - This is your fault. - Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. He's not responding to a nuggie. He's really fucking dead. Welcome. We've been expecting you. I told them. I says, I says, just you wait, he'll be here. There's a lot of work to do, Marcus. And we're here to help. How do you know my name? We know a lot more than you'd expect. But you shouldn't concern yourself with such things. Like I said before, we're here to help. Help, how? Well, you kind of just left your life unfinished didn't ya? Kind of just left because of others. You left and there is still so much more to do. You see, we are here to help you set things right. Right the wrong. Punish those that caused you pain. How do I do that? That's where we come in, bucko. - But- - No buts about it. But we need the book. It's part of us. We entrusted it to you to show that we are friends. I don't have any friends. Not among the living. But we are your friends. You are one of us now. What do you want from me? There's a lot of work to do. You can help us to deliver justice. Let us remember Isaiah 57, "the righteous perish and no one takes it to heart. "The merciful are taken away "and no one understands that the righteous are taken away "to be spared from the evil to come. "He shall enter into peace. "They shall rest in their beds. "Each one walking in their uprightness." Marcus, may you find rest as you lie in death. And walking uprightly, enter into peace. Hello. James Savini? You're the brother of the deceased, right? Yeah, who are you? Alice Jones, reporter for the Daily Beacon. The Daily Beacon. You guys really made a media circus out of this. Why do you think I tried to keep the service private? Well, we and the press do try to walk a tightrope between respecting individual privacy and serving the needs of the community. The community. What community? Marcus was shunned. He was harassed by college students. The only thing that made him part of the community was that he was killed in public. I understand your feelings, sir. In fact, I'm trying to help. Help how? What are you gonna do now that Marcus is gone? We can tell his story so this kind of thing won't happen again. No, you're just trying to cash in on a tragedy so you can get clicks and subscriptions. I'm not gonna help you exploit my brother's death. That's not it at all. This is bigger than Marcus. This is about Donville. You think this is the first time people have been harmed and it's been hushed up. If we can tell his story, then the people in this town will know how deep the problems are and maybe we can start to change people's attitudes. Here's my card. If you change your mind and wanna talk, just give me a call. I'm sorry for your loss, Mr. Savini Hey, this is that kid Marcus' place. Who the hell are you? I'm his brother. I'm here to get his stuff. Well I'm his landlord. You got one week. Come in. James, is it? You're Marcus' brother, right? Uh, yeah. Who are you? I'm Amy. I live next door. Oh, that's right. I saw you at the funeral yesterday. I didn't realize Marcus had any friends. Yeah, unfortunately, not everyone in this town cares about disabled people like Marcus. No shit. Why haven't I seen you around here before? You know, to visit him. Marcus and I never really got along. Plus, I have to take care of our sick mom. She's probably gonna get even sicker now that my brother's gone. It stuck me. What's this? Clowns and circuses. He was so obsessed with clowns and circuses. I never knew why. Why would he have something like this in the apartment? He was never a violent person. Well, maybe he was on the inside. killer Look, I wanna get out of there. This place is too depressing. If you wanna talk some more, my place is next door. Yeah, for sure. So how long have you known my brother? For a while now. I see. I wish I did too. Once he moved, everything kind of fell apart. Yeah, sometimes things happen. They sure do. He was a good guy. A handful. Yeah, but a good guy nonetheless. It's just so stupid. I'd argue with him over little things. Things that just seemed so insignificant now. I miss him too. It sucks. I just feel like I failed my role as his brother. Anyway, thanks for the drink. No problem. I'll talk to you? Yeah, for sure. If you need anything, let me know. Sure. So I'm telling this fucking guy, I'm like, this is it, all right. I'm done playing around. If you keep bugging me about this shit, here's what's gonna happen. I'm gonna bash your fucking skull in. I'm done fucking playing. As you should. I mean, it's not my fault that your fucking slutty girlfriend keeps hitting on me. What? You can't satisfy your bitch and she comes rubbing up on my dick. That's on you, pal. I mean, grow a dick and fuck her right or grow some balls and put your dog on a leash. Either way, I got 99 problems and your bitch ain't one of 'em. Fuck. I don't know, man. I always found you kind of attractive. Yeah, I bet you did, homo. You better watch out. You're getting Jerry all hot and bothered over here. Can you guys quit it with the fucking faggot shit, already. Yeah, Zack. I mean, when that retard was kissing the dog, I bet you were really jealous of the dog. Am I right? Shut the fuck up, Elizabeth Jane. Oh yeah, Zack. You're probably into all kinds of shit, aren't you? Come on, tell us, we're your friends. Yeah, Zack, truth or dare. Fuck you guys, all right. I'm not the one who kissed a fucking dog, all right. That retard didn't even know what he was fucking doing, all right. I mean, at least he got a fucking kiss on his fucking birthday. You know what, fuck it, it doesn't fucking matter. It's in the past. It seemed like a good idea at the time but I guess it wasn't. Yeah, you're full of those ideas. He sure is. Oh, my God. Cock sucking, asshole motherfuckers. It's not my fault that fucking retard died, all right. Not my fault. It was just a fucking joke. Hey Zack, chill out, man. It was an accident. He ran into fucking traffic. Yeah, and why'd he fucking do that, huh? What do you mean, why? He was a retard. He didn't know what he was fucking doing. Who fucking invited him, huh, Liz? Dude! Hey, come on, calm down now. Why are you being such a fucking SJW all of a fucking sudden? What, you feel bad for fucking retards now? Fuck no. Look, I'm just fucking saying, all right. No. Then stop blaming this on my fucking girl. We were all there. We were all in this together. So we're just supposed to fucking carry on like nothing ever fucking happened? Zack, this is Donville. There's nowhere to fucking go. We're fucking stuck here. So it just doesn't matter, huh? It's over. Marcus is gone. Right, he's gone, man. Hey, but we're still here. We're normal fucking people. Those other people is not our fucking problem, right? I guess you guys are right. I don't know what I was fucking thinking. Look, I'll be back in a couple of minutes. I gotta piss like a fucking racehorse. You want me to hold it? You know what, maybe you should. The doctor said no heavy lifting for me. Jerry, I swear, if that's you, I'm gonna piss in your faggot mouth. Jerry, I swear to fucking God. Oh shit, it's you in the flesh. I thought you died, retard. Oh, my God, you look even dumber than before. I didn't think that was possible. You know what, retard? I'm gonna kill you and this time you're gonna stay dead. Son of a bitch. You're doing a fine job, Marcus, just like we discussed. I'd piss in his mouth. Unless you're not into that sort of thing. Cut the fucker. Wait, wait. We can be friends. I promise, I promise. My hand. You cock sucking, asshole, motherfucker. My hand. Yeah, now he's only got one hand. Oh, sorry. Good, finish the bastard off. Who's the Kool-Aid man now, asshole? Hey, what's up, guys? What's up? What the fuck is that? It's probably just Zack being a fucking dick. Stop being such a pussy. Yeah, I guess you're probably right. Heads up. High school radio station HBFM, founded in 1986 will cease operation at the end of the school year, due to budget cuts. Donville's football program will not be affected by these cuts. And HBFM is expected to provide full coverage of the final game of the season before shutting down. This just in, a Donville College student has been found dead in Legacy Park. Adam Griffin has more on the story. Adam. The young man has been identified as Zachary Landi. Three HCC classmates of his are in shock over the incident that the police are now calling a homicide. We were just hanging out by the campfire when Zach said he was just going to the bathroom. And then we heard this voice. That's the fucking bitch that got Marcus killed. Heads up. And then a head just came flying in the fire. Can we just get the cameras out of our face right now? Now the police say they have no suspects as of yet but are continuing their search into this matter. Back to you, Steve. Thank you, Adam. In other news- - It never fucking ends. Goddammit, retards are such lazy bums. His brother is in for it. I told him to get this shit outta here. Where did you take it? Nowhere. Where is it? I don't know. Look. Shh. Where is the book? What book? Our book. His brother was here the other day. Maybe he has it. He doesn't know. What do you think, Marcus? Want me to spare him? No. You people tried to kill us but we're back. Make America great again. What about make clowns great again, motherfucker? Best circus fire since Hartford. Damn you, Obama. - What the fuck? - Kelly, it's Amy. Let me in. Amy, go away. Kelly, it's a fucking emergency. Open the fucking door. - Amy- - Where's your phone? Where's your phone? Where's your phone? It's an emergency. I don't have my phone. Amy, what's going on? Great, an interrogation. My building was burned. There's a man burned alive. I don't have my fucking phone. I need a goddamned phone. Okay, okay, it's right there. Amy. Amy. Amy? Amy, I'm not gonna pound the door down but I need you to talk to me. I wanna help but I can't do that if you shut me out. My friend Marcus died, the boy that lives next door from me, right after you dumped me. Oh, my God, Amy. Some college kids, they played a prank on him. And then he ran away from them and he got hit by a car. And it hasn't stopped there. One of those kids got killed. And then there was a fire at our building and there was a man burned alive. I think it was our old landlord but I couldn't tell. I'm so sorry. I'm here for you, anything you need. Open the door. - Kelly. - Amy. - Amy. - Kelly. I just need you to hold me. - Calm down, Amy. - I'm sorry. Amy, calm down. I'm right here. I'm so sorry. Breathe through this. I'm right here. Marcus? Marcus? Marcus? Amy? You okay? Yeah, I just had a crazy dream. What did you dream about? My friend, Marcus. But it wasn't Marcus. He was evil. And laughing. First, he was crying and then laughing. I don't get it. Don't worry about it. Just go back to bed. It's all right. Hello? What the hell is this? Sir, it's a crime scene. I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to- - This is my brother's apartment, man. - What happened? - Fire. Fire. That's some next level CSI deduction. I thought the landlord just did a fucking lousy paint job. The landlord's dead, smart ass. He was taken out of here yesterday, burnt to a crisp. What about Amy? Neighbor? We don't know. The door was left open. She hasn't been home yet. You okay? Yeah. I'm okay. You've been through a lot. I'll be all right. So where are we now? - What, you and me? - Um-hmm. Do you think we need some time apart? Do you? I asked you. Sorry, I made all this shit worse. You must really hate me. No. No, you were here for me when I needed you. I appreciate that so much. I do have to go. Do you have my shoes still? Yeah, they're in the closet. I love you. Thank you. Still love you, grad school girl. Please call me if you need anything. I will. - I love you too. - Love you. Boo! Shit, I need to get different weed. Jerry, did you get that medicine that I need? Yes, Aunt Debbie. Jerry, could you turn that down? I'm trying to rest. Did you hear what I said? Yes, I heard you. Stop clowning around. No, we've only started. What do you think, Marcus? One less bat in our belfry. I don't know her. She's done nothing to me. But this is where that kid lives. I followed him here. So if she's the one raising him, then she's responsible too. I don't know. It has to be this way, Marcus. You think we didn't try compassion too? We did and look what happened to us. We have to fight back. It's a cruel world, Marcus and we have to be just as cruel in return. Oh, cut it out, Rosco. Cut it out, that's an excellent idea. Aunt Debbie? Fucking bitch. Aunt Debbie, could you please just go- What's the matter, Jerry? I thought you liked movies about killer clowns. Here, have a whiff. That's him, right, Marcus? Yes. He must be punished. Do you understand now? I understand. Then do what must be done. What? Thank you for your patience ma'am and your assistance. No problem. You guys didn't take anything, did you? If I open up my Charmed box set and there's a disc missing, - I know who to blame. - What? Nothing, never mind. Have a good day. Hello? Hello, James? Yeah, I just got back in. Yeah, the whole thing's unbelievable. Sure, I can meet. How soon? Okay, I'll see you. Bye. I just get a bad feeling off this book. I've no idea where Marcus found it, but he had it on him when he died. I saw that clown. What do you mean? I saw him recently. Where? That house on Castle Avenue. He was standing on the front lawn and he just disappeared right in front of my face. You mean where the college kid and his aunt lived? The two people that were murdered. What? When? Amy, didn't you hear? Can I borrow this book for a day or so? I mean, I guess but why? Because I know there's a connection between them and I'm gonna figure it out. This is the clown. I swear, that's the clown I saw. Oh my God, that's the guy that I saw. That must be his nephew. Peter's uncle, John Bannon, is a performer. Rosco. What's the connection? Three clown performers arrested in child abuse. Hey, Dan. How's my favorite brother doing? Good. You're here early. Where's Mom? She's in a hurry to get to the airport. Yeah, I bet. - Well, come on in. - Sure. Make yourself at home. I'm so glad you're here, Dan. You have no idea how glad. - Hey, Amy? - Yes. I wish I could see Marcus again. I already miss him. I know. I miss him too. How did he die? Well, Dan, some very nasty people pulled a prank on him and it got out of hand. You mean Liz and her friends? Yeah, how did you know that? Marcus, told me about them on Facebook. Oh, I see. Amy, why do those assholes blame Marcus so much? Well, Dan, you see, there are a lot of nasty, bad people in this world and Marcus fell victim to these bad people. But since Marcus died, these bad people have been getting killed. But Dan, not everyone's bad and nasty. Just look at me and Mom. I don't know about our mom. She calls me a dyke at home sometimes. Amy, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to get you upset. It's okay, it's not your fault. I just had a really shitty week, that's all. I'll tell you what? Is there a particular movie you wanna go see? Yeah, the Peanut Butter Falcon. Oh yeah, isn't that the movie where the guys has Down's Syndrome - and becomes a pro wrestler? - Yeah, it sure is. All right, then. Well, I'll go look at the show times and we can see something that will change our mood. Yeah. I do one day wanna become a wrestler too, just like The Undertaker. Oh yeah. We'll see, maybe. ♪ Let's all go to the lobby ♪ ♪ Let's all go to the lobby ♪ ♪ Let's all go to the lobby ♪ ♪ To get ourselves a treat ♪ ♪ Delicious things to eat ♪ Can you believe they still screen this old shit? It is an indie theater. So, this shit's so outdated. At least if they served beer here, I could pour one on the curb for Zach and Jerry. Can we not talk about that? Okay. Remind me why we couldn't go to another theater to see the new Rambo. Like the AMC, at least it has reclining chairs. Because it's only in select theaters now. And besides, the AMC is too far away and we don't have a car, so we have to see what's here in Donville. Whatever, this shit's so old, it should just be forgotten. Great, fucking power's out now. It's an old theater. I'm sure they'll fix it. They better. We paid to go see this damn thing. Don't worry about it, Brad. I'm here alone, in the dark, with you. I feel safe. Shh, guess who? Fuck you, dead man. Shit, what was that? Brad? That was weird. Hey, Brad. Shh, it's not nice to talk during the movie, cunt. Please, somebody help me. Open the door. Hi, Liz. Marcus? I missed my birthday, Liz. Still wanna celebrate? Yes, Marcus. We can go get some birthday cake. Have some pie instead. She passed the acid test. Hello! Whoa, you scared the ba-Jesus out of me. Well, how we doing, folks? How can I do ye for today? Hi, can we get two for Peanut Butter Falcon, please? Peanut Butter Falcon. Well, as fine as of a movie as that is, may I suggest Post-Apocalyptic Commando Shark or possibly Bloody Island, if you wanna get really scared. No, no thank you. Just two for the uh, no scary stuff for us. If you insist. - There you are, kids. - Thank you. - Enjoy the show. - Thank you. I can't wait to see this movie. Yeah. What do you want, kiddo. I want popcorn and diet Coke. Marcus? Holy shit! Well, you two were the first to discover the deceased. Can you tell me what you saw? Ma'am, you first? Well, my brother and I, we were in the lobby heading to see the Peanut Butter Falcon, when I saw a fat clown in the hallway. Wait a minute, did you say a fat clown? Yes, I did, officer. Ma'am, I've been interviewing people here all night, inside and out. Nobody has mentioned anything about seeing a clown. That's impossible. I swear to you, there was a clown. Listen, I understand this has been a shock to you and your brother but please try to take this a little more seriously. We get enough clown hoaxes. I don't understand. The clown was real, it had to be. What about you, young man? Did you see a clown? No, officer, I did not. Just the dead body. Well, I've heard enough here. Thank you for your cooperation. Have a good night. He's gonna think I'm crazy. You didn't see a clown? Nothing? I'm telling you, James, I saw them. I mean, you're saying that you saw Marcus, dressed as a clown, together with another clown? I said I saw Marcus but I didn't say he was alive. And you think that they're the ones that killed Liz and the others? Listen, I know it sounds crazy since I'm the only one that saw them. But I don't know what to do. Maybe seeing a therapist would help. Look, I'm not saying that you're crazy. A lot of people that go through trauma talk to therapists for help. How's Dan doing since yesterday's incident? He's okay. A little shaken up but okay. He's watching wrestling to calm down. That's what he loves to do. How long is he staying with you for? For about a week. My mom and I, we don't get along. Oh, how come, if I may ask? - Because I'm a lesbian. - Oh, I see. Maybe you're right. Maybe I do need some help. Or maybe I just need to keep digging on researching the history of clowns in Donville. I don't see how that's gonna help you. Well, I like to face my trauma heads on. What do you suggest, a trip to Florida? Florida, no. That place is a trauma zone, especially since it's Trump land rather than Disneyland. You mean Disney World? Do you wanna hear the definition of a clown? Not really. Well, I'm gonna tell you anyway. It says, the clown is an archetype that dates back centuries. It is the character of a yokel, a lowly, foolish laborer. An underdog. Someone simple-minded for people to laugh at. A related character is the tramp. You know, like Charlie Chaplin? Again, someone to laugh at because of his lower status. What's that? You wanna know about any skeletons in this town's history? I think I know someone that can help us. - Who is Alice Jones? - A journalist. Where did you meet her? I thought you were a lesbian. I was hoping you'd finally talk with me. So what have you found out? This newest wave of murders happened in Legacy Park. So, why is that significant? Wait a minute. I was researching this in my class. That's where Tony Casey died. Yeah, you're way ahead of me. Guys, who's Tony Casey? I don't think I've heard this story. He was a teenager who killed himself in the park back in the early 2000s. He slit his own throat. The police found his body in the park. Then later it became known that he was being harassed and bullied for being gay and that's probably why he killed himself. This must've been before my time. I don't even think I've heard of this. Yeah, people stopped talking about it. So what? Just another lost piece of Donville history? It gets better. Soon after his death, other people started getting murdered. They were really weird murders and none of them were ever solved. But all the murder victims were homophobes. People who had been arrested for hate crimes or who had voted against- - Wait, wait, wait. What does any of this have to do with Marcus and the clowns? Marcus wasn't gay, as far as I know. But he was different and people in this town, they don't like people who are different. And most of the time, people who are different don't dare fight back. But what if something fights back for them? So you guys think that something killed all those homophobes in the early 2000s. And that same something is now punishing all the people who punished Marcus for being disabled? Yeah, that's what I'm leaning towards. Okay, but where's your proof? When I was researching clowns and circuses in this area, I found an article with a picture of a circus troupe. I recognized the clowns from the photo that were in Marcus' book. Here is a picture of the leader of the troupe. This is his nephew, Peter Bannon. That's where I come in. Peter Bannon's still alive and still here in town. I've been tracking him and I think I know someone who can get to him. Who and how do we find this person? Why do you think I chose this diner? Will that be all folks? Any dessert? Nah, none for me, thanks. Okay, then. Here's your bill. Actually, there is one thing you could help us with. What can you tell us about Peter Bannon? Yeah, I saw an old news article. He would be an old man by now. No, I don't know anything about him. I think you do. This isn't the first time I've asked you about him. Now, will you help these nice people? Peter Bannon , yeah. I guess I remember him. Do you know where he lives? Yeah, but I wouldn't advise it. He's not a nice guy. Could you please tell us where he lives? It's important. Well, okay. But don't tell me I didn't warn you. This is not a door you wanna open. I'm a journalist, that's my job. Are you sure you wanna do this? I'm positive. Okay, then. - Here you go. - Thank you. Shall I go with you? Nah, we got this. - Mr. Bannon? - Go away. Mr. Bannon, my name is Amy Carpenter. I wanna talk to you. Go away or I'm calling the cops. It's about clowns. Come on, Amy. Let's just go. What about clowns? I've seen 'em twice now and I believe they're killing people in this town but nobody believes me. Come on in but I haven't got much time. We have helped you, Marcus. We have punished those who have wronged you. And now you must help us. How? The book. We need our book back. I don't know where it is. Someone must've taken it. What did the man in the red hat say? Maybe your brother has it. My brother. No, don't hurt my brother. What about the woman next door? Maybe she has it. Amy? No , she's my friend. She saw us. She saw you. She will try to stop us. She will ruin everything if we don't get that book. No, please leave her alone. Who do we go after next, Marcus? Your family or your friends? Choose. You can look but don't touch. Now what is it you wanna know about the clowns? You're wasting my time. A few days ago, I was driving and I saw a clown wave to me and he went into a little tent and disappeared. It was right in front of a house where a couple of people had been murdered on that same night. Then I took my brother to the movie theater and I saw another clown. But when I went to go see what was going on, I saw my friend Marcus. My friend, Marcus, has been dead for over a week. I went to his funeral. I saw him at the movie theater dressed as a clown. But nobody else has seen him except for me and nobody believes me. Was your friend Marcus disabled? Yes, how did you know that? You should sit down. This could take awhile. Many years ago, when in was seven or eight years old, I had an uncle who was a circus clown. Small circus here in Donville and they would entertain the folks around here and entertain the children, especially those in the institutions up and around here. However, one day, they found that my uncle was gay. Not a great thing to be back then. No, it wasn't. And pretty soon, rumors and lies started all around here that my uncle and the clowns were not only gay but pedophiles too. That's always the assumption, isn't it. Eventually, the police got involved and I was told that they were taken down state, tried and convicted. That was the last I heard of them. Years later, when I was in my mid-20s, I found one of the officers who was involved in my uncle being arrested. I asked him, what happened to the clowns? What happened to my uncle? He told me, there was no trial. They were taken into the woods, they were beaten and killed, and buried in a mass grave. Oh, my God. And the former officer who told me this story, he died a very mysterious, grisly death the next day. What about the other officers? When I met with him, he was the last one alive. They also had died mysterious, gruesome deaths. Revenge from beyond, if you ask me. Mr. Bannon, what can you tell us about this book? Mr. Bannon? I'm sorry. My Uncle Rosco made this book. He took pictures of all the places he had visited, all the children he had helped. He wanted this book to promote charity for all those with disabilities who were stuck, stuck in institutions. This book was an embodiment of his compassion. It became something dark and a focus of their power of destruction and a lure for whoever shares their desire for revenge. Where did you get this? My brother had it on him when he died. Was he different? Well, yes, he had a disability. That's why the clowns chose him. They've already made him into one of their own. Mr. Bannon, I am so sorry about your uncle. No amount of sorrow will bring back my uncle or his friends. They not only lost their lives, they lost their souls. This town is haunted by their ghosts. No one believes me or ever will. Now get out! I believe you. Goddammit, get out! I told you. I told you. Now you believe me? And in more depressing news, after 158 years, the Williamson Gazette has decided to close its doors. To the dying art of journalism. Along with plummeting ad revenue, have made the standard printed newspaper a thing of the past. 78 full-time employees will be searching for jobs in an industry that has transformed into something old news people like myself do not recognize any more. What are your thoughts? Hello? Yes, I think there's an intruder in my home. Yes, I can stay on the line. Please send someone quick. Oh, officers, thank God. There's something in my home. Relax, miss. You don't have anything to worry about. We're gonna take a little drive, miss. What? Drive to where? To the woods. You've been nosing around in police business, haven't you, miss? Now Andy Williams coming in. Butcher, gonna lift up none of it high. - Power bomb. - Slams him down. That could be all that she wrote. Surprised Andy's not going for the cover here. Ah, shit. Hello? Who's there? You know, Amy, we should've asked him what to do now. I don't think so. He obviously didn't want us there at all. Okay, but he sat us down, told us the whole story. Maybe there's something he knows that can help us. Help us do what? Fight ghosts. Amy, why are you taking this so seriously? Because, one of them saw me. They know I'm on to them. I could be next. These clowns are going after people that hurt Marcus. You never did that. That's right and you're his brother. So we're the ones that have nothing to worry about, right? I guess you're right. Hey, you wanna come in for awhile? We can go see Dan. He'll put us in a better mood after that history lesson. - Yeah, sure. - Okay. That's weird. - Dan? - Maybe he fell asleep. At this time, I highly doubt it. Something's weird. - Dan! - I'm sure he's probably in the bathroom or something. This isn't funny. Open the door. Dan? Where are you, Dan? - Dan? - Amy. Oh, my God. We have to give the clowns their book back. If your brother's been abducted, we need to go to the police. The police. James, the police in this town are the ones who started this. I don't really trust them either but if your brother's been abducted, we have to go to the police. And tell them what? That my brother was abducted by ghosts. We don't have time. We have to give the clowns their book back before it's too late. Amy, isn't there anyone that you can trust? Kelly. Hello? Kelly, it's me. Listen, I don't know what to do. Dan's been kidnapped. I have to go to Legacy Park. I don't even know if he's dead or alive or what they're gonna do to me. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down, slow down. I'm so scared. What's going on? I don't know what to do. I'm so sorry that I involved you. Hello? Oh, you should be. Who's this? Oh, I'm the clown that just killed your little girlfriend. Bring our book to the park or your little brother gets it. Bring it now. Fuck you. Fuck you, you fucking monster. We gotta go. The book's in the car, we gotta go. Wait, what? We have to go! Where am I? Where no one can hurt you anymore. Who are you people? These are my friends. I'm your friend, Marcus. Why have I been taken here? It's complicated. But they explained it to me. We protect those who have been wronged. And we want to do the same for you, Dan. What do you mean? Aren't you tired of it, Dan? All the cruelty. All the bigotry. - I am. - Then join us. What? We hurt people who hurt us. The people who killed Marcus, we killed them back. Join us, Dan. Help us write the next chapter in our book. No. I don't wanna hurt anyone. The book will be here soon. I hope you change your mind by then or you'll be the page that we rip out. Now what? Amy, we don't know who's in there. What if they're armed? We know who's in there. It's the fucking clowns that Peter told us about. Fucking clowns. Amy, Peter's a crazy old man. I doubt it is undead clowns that have your brother in there. But what if it is? If the book is so important to them, maybe we have leverage. James, please, my brother's life's at stake. Let's go do this. I would do this for you if Marcus was in there. Come on. Fuck, all right. That's the tent. We have to go in. Come on. Amy! Dan! Release my brother now, you motherfuckers. Marcus? Marcus, as you knew him, no longer exists. He's one of us now. Release my brother now. Ah, ah, ah, not so fast. Give us the book first, then Danny Boy walks free. It's the source of our power! Shut it, fatty. It's none of their business. I could destroy this book. No, Dan! And we can destroy him, so what's it gonna be? Amy, wait! Now you have your fucking book, let my brother go. Um, no. Let him go! We had a deal! Sorry, bitch, but we decided to make him one of us. You motherfuckers. James. Float like a balloon, sting like a bee. James. Oh, Dan. Drop the weapon, Dan, or we kill your friends. Wait, Marcus. I have something to say to everyone. Hold on, my brother clowns. Dan here has something he needs to say. Well, we're waiting. You're my friend, Marcus. I don't want you to hurt my sister and James. It's already too late. The clowns are my family now. I am your family and so is Amy and James. I'm sorry you were treated like shit by Liz and the others. Don't listen to him, Marcus. We're your real family, as he soon will be. I know the clowns took you in as their family when you died, but I can offer you something better. Which is what? Trust, loyalty, compassion, and love. You're my friend, Marcus, and also my brother, forever and ever. That's hot, that's hot. Dan. Goodbye. You can rest now. Hey, James. How are you holding up? Okay. The doctor said I should be able to do things normally pretty soon. Oh, that's good to hear. How are you? Is your mom still upset about what happened with Dan? Yeah, pretty much. You did tell her that he was kidnapped and murdered by a bunch of guys in the woods though, right? Yeah, and she said that I should've never left Dan alone by himself to begin with, even though she did the same with him all the time. Sorry, to hear that. You think the police will believe your story? Well, Liz and her friends were killed in mysterious circumstances. What happened to Dan is being treated like that. So now we've each lost a brother. Yeah, I guess so. Another story for this town to bury. Anyway, I just wanted to check in and say hi. I'll talk to you later, all right? Okay, I'll talk to you later. And James? Thank you for all your help. Don't mention it. Bye. What the fuck? This is impossible, I saw you all die. Well, bitch, you just can't keep a good clown down. But I burned the book and it destroyed all of you. This is the second edition. Oh no, what is going on? Get the fuck off of me.
