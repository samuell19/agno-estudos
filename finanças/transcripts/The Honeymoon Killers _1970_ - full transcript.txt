{Explosion) {Coughing) - What happened? - Someone's made a little mistake... and put some chlorine and ammonia together. I don't think she'll do it anymore. You again, Severns. Are you all right? I think so, Miss Beck. I didn't realise it was the ammonia. It's a good thing I was here. She could've been hurt. What were you doing in here, Jackson? Why aren't you on the ward where you belong? Ah, now I see what happened. I don't give a damn what the two of you do outside this hospital... but, in here, you're as bad as the ammonia and chlorine. Now get out of here, Jackson! This is a hospital laboratory, not a motel room. I don't wanna see you in here again. Do you understand me? I think I do, Miss Beck. Everything's all right. Go back 10 your stations. As for you, Severns, I'll deal with you later. You've already kept me overtime. I want you in my office first thing tomorrow morning. I'm sorry, Miss Beck. You'll be a lot sorrier if you're ever out of line with me again. - {Dogs barking) - (Children playing) (Door opens) Hi, hon. Jesus, it's clammy, huh? And it's only April. I hope you got some beer in here. You're all out. I thought you were gonna keep her at your place. Well, she said she wanted to lie down... so I said "Why don't you go into my bedroom and lie down till Martha comes home?" Then I could do my housework. But no. No. She had to lie down in her own bedroom. I'm telling you, she's the queen mother. {(Martha) Huh. God, she's a pain in the ass. She can't help it if she's getting senile. - (Sighs) I'm all in. - Oh, listen. I'd better give you your mail before I forget it and walk off with it. Who sent this? Who sent this? I never applied for anything like this. - What's the matter with you? - What is it, some kind of April Fools' Day joke? If it is, it stinks. I thought you were goin' on a diet. What are you eatin' the pretzels for now? You're gonna have supper soon. They're full of salt, and then you start drinkin' like a fish. - You know how fattenin' that is? - Leave me alone! I'm hungry! Do you mind! Jesus, Martha. I'm sorry. I never would've sent in your name if I knew it would upset you like this. You sent it? Martha. What's the matter with my little girl? Stop it, Mama! I'm not your little girl. It isn't some man you're mixed up with, is it? - Oh, Mama, please! - Why don't you leave your daughter alone? Can't you see how upset she is? She's been mean to me all day long. Now I'm gonna lie down in my own bed. That's a good idea, Mama. I'll call you when supper's ready. Thanks for the April Fools' Day joke. Aw, come on, Martha. For Christ's sake, what kind of a friend do you think I am? Sure, I sent in your name. - What'd you do it for? - Will you just look at this? "No more lonely nights for these two lucky people. "But was it really luck? "No, it was Aunt Carrie who brought them together. "She can open the door to exciting new friendships for you. Why not drop her a line? It may change your lonely life." Martha, you just need a man. OK, honey, you're a little on the heavy side... but you're not an old bag, you know? You could be pretty sexy with the right man. Come on. Let's fill it out. What you got to lose? - Let's see it. - Here, before you change your mind. I'll help you with it. Where's a pen? In the cabinet. - You sure this is all right? - What you got to lose? God, what questions. Do I have to tell the truth? So, who's puttin' you on the witness stand? I suppose there's no harm in it. Do you think someone will really write to me? Well, there's only one way to find out. And someday, you might even thank me for this. Dear Martha... I hope you will allow me the liberty... of addressing you by your Christian name. To tell you the truth, I don't quite know how to begin this letter to you. Because I must confess... this is the first letter of this sort I have ever written. (Man's voice) Would you like to know a little bit about me? I'm 34, and I've been told I'm not a bad-looking fellow. I'am in the importing business from Spain, my mother country. I live alone here in this apartment - much too large for a bachelor - but I hope someday to share it with a wife. Why did I choose you for my debut friendship letter? Because you are a nurse, and therefore I know have a full heart, and a great capacity for comfort and love. Your friend Raymond Fernandez. (Raymond's voice) I must confess to you.. Your charming letters have cheered my life. {Martha's voice) Dear Raymond Thanks for your picture. You are exactly as I imagined. Here is one of me, though it doesn't do me justice. I want you to call me Ray. Only one woman ever did that - a childhood sweetheart long ago. The day I find a letter from you... always goes 50 much better. Send me a lock of your hair. Dearest, the scarf was so beautiful! I will try to come and see you and Mother. I can't wait fill you arrive. (Sighs} I still can't move. That was a wonderful dinner. I made the pecan pie. - Oh, the very best part of the meal, Mrs. Beck. - (Giggling) - You want another drink, Mama? - Another drink? You don't usually let me have even one. - Well, this is a very special occasion. - (Giggling) What about you, Martha? You haven't even had your first. Oh, maybe just a little one. I'm counting calories. I'll help you get it. I'm sorry Mother's such a nuisance. I think she's adorable. Would you think I was terrible if I gave her a sleeping pill? No. I want to be alone too. Here, Mama. You can take your vitamin. But I already had my vitamin pill this morning. You know I forgot to give it to you this morning. - This one looks different. - It's the new kind I got at the hospital. How she babies me! Did you find your record, Mrs. Beck? Yes, I did. See? This is the record I found for Raymond. I want you to play it because I like him. He's the nicest beau you ever had, Martha. {Giggling) He's the Latin from Manhattan. Oh, Mama, that's not funny. No, I think it's charming - a record in my honour. - (Latin lounge) - Thank you, bella signora. Who wants to rumba with me? I do. {Martha) Do it yourself. We'll watch. She's asleep. Let's put her in the bedroom. No. She won't know a thing. Here. Give me your hand. Don't be a shy nurse. - (Crying) - Darling, please don't cry again. I wouldn't be able to get on the train. I can't help it. I didn't think you'd be going so soon. If I'm not home when those icons come COD... I'll have lost hundreds of dollars. I couldn't even have had today if it weren't for your loan. I would have to be back in New York today before the banks close. (Doorbell chimes) - Yes? - (Man) Special delivery for Miss Beck. I'm Miss Beck. Thank you. {Man whistling) Bunny? Bunny! Bunny! Bunny, let me in! Bunny! What? I don't believe it. Were the police there? No, of course you shouldn't call the police. You're wonderful, Bunny. She can't live without me? Cant I talk to the poor darling? Oh, no. She doesn't even know I'm calling. I'm calling you from my apartment. Oh, you don't know how sick she is from all that gas. We can thank our lucky stars that I got to her in time. What a story for the newspapers. What? Oh, get away from her. Leave her alone. Ray? Um... oh, no. That was my new little puppy. He was jumpin' all over Martha. I was afraid he was gonna wake her up. Did I say that? Oh, well, uh... I'm just so nervous, I don't know what I'm ea yin'. Oh, no. She's here in my apartment, in my bed. Oh, I wouldn't leave her alone. I don't know what she'd do. Oh, no. She - she can't talk to you. - She's unconscious. - (Moaning) Ray. Ray - I wanna die. I can hear her. Let me talk to her. - (Moaning) - Now, Martha. Martha, look at me. It's Bunny. Bunny. Ray is on the phone. {Moans) No, Ray, she won't come to the phone. She says you don't love her and she wants to die. She says you'll read about it in the papers when she kills herself. Tell her I love her. Wait a minute, Ray. He says he loves you. Ray, I think she'll come to the phone now. Hello? Ray? Darling? I didn't mean it. Ray, listen. You gotta come down here. If you don't, I-I'll kill myself. I swear. Oh, I can't get away now, sweetheart. Would you like to come up here for a little visit? (Raymond) You crazy little fool. {Raymond) Now that you know everything about me... ...do you still love me? Yes. You would still commit suicide for me? Yes. You don't want to call the police? You don't want to sue me? No. I have to go through with the marriage to the Acker woman. Wait until after then. You've got to go back to Mobile anyway. You can't leave your mother with that woman forever. - Go back to the hospital. - How can I... ...knowing you're with another woman? I won't touch her. I promise. I'll get everything from her before the wedding. There'll be no honeymoon? I'll dump her right away. It's not like this. Then you'll come back to Mobile. Yes. We'll work our future out together. I promise. All right. After Mrs. Flynn called to say you'd gone to New York... I came in here to find the assignment chart. I'm afraid you left some of your rather torrid correspondence... with a Mr. Fernandez in New York. I think you'd better take it with you. I don't think our board of directors would look kindly... on our supervisor of nurses involved in a... lonely hearts scandal. How dare you go through my desk! You ought to be ashamed of yourself. I'm not so sure Hitler wasn't right about you people. Mrs. Beck, get out of here... before I forget I'm a gentleman. You bet I'm getting out of here. And don't make that cheque out to Martha Beck. Make it out to Mrs. Raymond Fernandez. What do you think I am? I went to New York to be married. Two can live as cheaply as one, darling. Let me congratulate the groom. Hi. This is Bunny, Ray. What do you mean stealin' the best friend a girl ever had? Yeah. Listen, now that you two have been spliced, I - Spliced. Married, Ray. Uh-huh. Now, don't you be a stranger, hear? OK. Here she is. -Hi. - You told her we're married? Uh-huh. Mama too. Jesus, Martha! I go to New Jersey next week to marry Doris Acker. How am I going to bring her back here if you're here? It's impossible. You know I've got to continue my business. - Don't worry. I'll think of something. - (Mama sobbing) - Now what's the matter? - Oh, that's Mama. She doesn't wanna go to New York. Martha, that's completely out of the question. I mean it. Look, you say you love me. OK. That you're going to kill yourself if you can't come up here. OK. But you can't bring the old lady. - (Mama continues crying) - What else am I gonna do with her? Get rid of her! Choke her! I don't care what the hell you do with her! But you can't bring her up here! You understand? Yeah, I understand. (Receiver slams down) {(Woman) I'll wait outside, Mrs. Fernandez, while you say goodbye to her. - (Martha) I have to go now, Mama. - Go. Go! I never want to see you again. - Mama, don't talk like that. - You're leavin' me here to die. Now that you have a husband, you want to be rid of me. I fold you, Mama, I have to find a job when I get to New York. Someone has to look after you. Don't worry. As soon as Ray and I are settled, we'll come back for you. It's a lie. It's a lie. You want to be rid of me. You're diggin' my grave, because you're killin' me by leaving me here. {Crying) You're killin' me! (Sobbing) - Goodbye, Mama. - (Door closes) Martha! Don't go. I'm sorry for what I said. Take me with you, I won't be any trouble. I promise you. Please don't leave me. I'm afraid, Martha! Martha, don't go! It's too bad when they get senile. You can begin billing me at the first of the month at the New York address. Goodbye. Goddamn you! Goddamn you! I hope you end up like this! (Sobbing) I hope someone does this to you! (Man) And so by virtue of the authority vested in me... as justice of the peace of Morris County, New Jersey... I hereby pronounce you, Doris Acker... and you, Raymond Fer-Fernandez... man and wife. You may kiss the bride. Aren't you going to congratulate me too, Mrs. Beck? - Oh, I think you should call my sister Martha. - Martha. Your car drives very well, Doris. Our car, darling. Goodbye, Morristown High School. See you in the fall. I can't wait to see the expression on my kids' faces... when I tell them. "Boys and girls, from now on... you are to address me as Mrs. Fernandez." Did they think you would stay a spinster forever? Is there something wrong with that word, darling? Oh. My English. Doesn't that mean "maiden"? (Laughs) Oh! You are adorable. I just can't wait to see our apartment. 10 beautiful For spacious skies 1 For amber waves of grain J For purple mountain majesties 7 Above the fruited plain 7 America, America J God shed His grace on thee 7 And crown thy good with brotherhood & Ray? Darling? Where are you? In the living room, Doris. Bring me a towel, love. Are you coming out now? No. The bride is going to take a nice soak. But I miss you, sweetie. Bring me a towel. We're married, you know. (Doris, laughing) Oh, come on. I've seen it before. {Doris laughing, moaning) {Quiet commotion in bathroom) {Doris yelping, laughing) (Doris) I'll be out in a little while, lover. {Doris) 7 Glory, glory hallelujah I Glory, glory hallelujah I His truth is marching on ¢ Too quick. Too quick! - What's too quick? - You shouldn't have taken her things last night. You should have left them to me to do later the way I always do. And now she wants them back. She's furious. Where is she? In the bedroom. She is packing. (Suitcases slam) - Good morning. -I'm leaving! Already? That was a pretty short honeymoon. Honeymoon? You ought to tell your brother what's supposed to happen on a honeymoon. Before I go, I want my rings and my money belt. - Your what? - My two rings... and my money belt with the $2,000 in it. - I don't know what you're talking about. - Somebody took them. See here. Do you know what happens to people who make false accusations? - They get sued. - I want my rings and my money! You lower your voice. You're not in your classroom now. You give me back my things, or I'll make plenty of trouble for you. How dare you talk to my brother like that? And as for trouble, I wonder what the principal of your school would say... if he saw some of those letters you wrote to my brother. I was shocked to see such things from a school teacher. Don't they have a PTA out there? I'm leaving now. I guess I'm lucky I still have my car keys. So, who's stopping you? Why don't you let your brother talk for himself? You act more like a mother than a sister. Ray, you haven't said one word. Are you afraid of her or something? - Get out of here! -I'm going! This isn't the end. You'll hear from my lawyer! Get the hell out of here! (Door slams) Boy, was she a slob. Took me half an hour to clean up that bedroom. I think I'll put this on. Might be cold on that boat. Oh, I'm finally gonna get to see New York. And a boat ride is the best way to do it. - Who's that to? - A lady from Missouri - Myrtle Young. Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. What do you want to write her for? Because she'll give me $4,000 to marry her. - Isn't that a good enough reason? -Hmm. Here. You can hold this while I lock the door. "Charles Martin"? Where'd you think of that name? All she wants is a husband around when her bambino is born... 0 her mother and father won't disinherit her. - She's through with men. - They all say that after they've been knocked up. - "Knocked up"? - Pregnant. - Oh. {Laughing) - You write her that you'll marry her. In your next letter, you better tell her... that your married sister, Mrs. Beck, is coming along with you. Excellent idea, Mrs. Beck. - (Martha sighs) - Well, this is it, kids. It's not Tara. It's not even Little Rock. - Your parents have a nice place there? - Oh, you bet. And if it wasn't for a certain married son of a bitch down there... I would be home right now. Certainly is a small apartment. Well, it's the best I could do. I didn't know you were comin' till last week. Well, wish you'd gotten a place with twin beds. I don't like sharing a double bed anyhow. - Not with a woman. - Well, you could always sleep in here. After all, Charles and I are married. (Chuckles) You know, you are much cuter than your picture. No, no, no, no, no. Not cuter. Let's say, uh, sexier. (Chuckles) I thought you were through with men. You sound just like my mama. Oh! Say, I think I will phone Mama and Papa. Well, now that I can produce a husband... I might just as well start the reconciliation. - What reconciliation? - Well, I'll give them the address. They still don't even know where I am. Then I will introduce them to their new son-in-law... ...fight on the phone. (Giggles) - My dark and handsome husband. - {Chuckling) And little ol' sis, the nurse... who has come all the way from New York... just to take care of me while I have my baby. Wait till tomorrow, Myrtle. - I'm too tired to charm them. - (Giggling) Oh. I think we should all go to sleep now. Oh, wait. In that case, [I just run down... and lock up my new, uh, second-hand car. (Giggles) I want to fetch up somethin' for Charles anyway. I'll be right back, folks. - Was all the money in the envelope? - Every cent. She was as good as her word. Well, now we ought to get out of here. - Martha, that's not fair. - Not fair? Why wait around fill she tells her parents about us? That wasn't part of the deal. I think we ought to get out of here before something happens. I'll talk her out of that in the morning. Well, [ don't like her. Martha, we are exhausted. At least let's stay the night. (Myrtle singing, indistinct, humming) - God, here she comes. - (Vocalising) I don't know what you two people are gonna do... but I'm gonna take a bath. Here, Charles. I brought you up your wedding present. A present? Oh, that wasn't necessary. Well, for whatever the reason, we are married. All signed, sealed and legal, right? Of course, of course. And I must say... you did keep your part of the bargain. Mm-hmm. Open up your present. I'm dyin' to see it on you. - Something to wear? - Open it up. You'll see. Oh, darlin', you look irresistible. - It's not bad, is it? - It's all gone. Hmm. I wonder why I never thought of that. - (Chuckling) - What's going on in here? How do you like your brother with his new little addition? - What, a wig? - It's not a wig. That is a hairpiece, Martha. I think he looks divine in it. Where did you get it? I, uh, bought it in New York just before we left. I thought it would be amusing to change my appearance a little. Well, it doesn't look too bad. I'll just have to get used to it, I guess. I think we should all go to bed now. Myrtle, why don't you take a nice hot bath? Well, now what is that supposed to mean? - What, do I smell or something? -No, no, no. My sister didn't mean anything. She's so used to her hospital routine. Well, I am going to make up my bed. Good night, ladies. I didn't mean that the way it sounded. There's nothing better than a good, hot soak. It really relaxes you. - Why don't you try it? - Well, maybe I will I do feel a little peaky. (Water running) She's in the bathtub. Not now. I'm tired. She might come in. You didn't care with Doris Acker. We made plenty of mistakes that night. Now go to bed. Keep your hands off her things. This whole thing must be handled with a little savoir faire... and you don't have it. - Do you understand? - (Door closes) Martha? Martha, are you up? No. (Giggles) (Myrtle laughing, chattering) (Ray) OK, now go to bed, my dear... and we'll talk about our marriage in the morning. (Sighs) Martha. - Martha, I told you - - Who's Martha? (Giggling) Oh, that's strange. Why did I call you Martha? - Go back to bed now. - I can't sleep. I thought maybe we could talk. I fold you we'll talk in the morning. - OK; let's not talk. - Uh-uh-uh. What's wrong? Can't you see I'm crazy about you? - My sister's in the other - - Aw, she's fast asleep. Oh, come on, baby. Why don't you explore a little bit? - (Sighs) - Oh, come on. Don't be so shy. Besides, you can't get me in any more trouble than I'm in... 50 let's have some fun. (Giggles) - Not now. - Oh, geez! - You act like a little ol' virgin boy. - Shh! That sister of yours mothers you too much. You want me to be your little ol' southern mammy? Hmm? Come on, honey baby. You want some sugar? Hmm? - That's nice. - (Laughs) (Ray) OK. Now go to sleep and stay there. Now promise me you'll stay there. - Oh, you are a meanie-weanie. - OK? - Yeah, I promise. -OK. Go. (Giggles) What's the matter? Can't you sleep? You woke me up. Oh, I'm sorry. I guess I'm just restless. (Sighs) You want a sleeping pill? I got some. - You have any other kind? - What do you mean? Never mind. You wouldn't You're too square. (Sighs) You sigh a lot, don't you? In nursing school, they taught us that people who sigh a lot are unstable. - Is that your problem? -No. I was just thinking about your brother... and how handsome he looks in that toupee I gave him. He lied to you. I don't believe it. He never lies to me. I think he's a little bit afraid of you. It's probably why he never married before. (Giggling) I bet I'm gonna have to show him what to do. - (Laughing) - You must think you're an authority. Well, I am pregnant. Not only are you pregnant, you are disgusting! You're the hottest bitch I've ever seen. And I don't have to take that from you. And let me tell you something. I'm in love with your brother, and if we decide to make a go of this marriage - which [ think we'll do, and sooner than you think - we'll get out of here before you can say Jack Robinson. Weill go to Little Rock. Why, as a matter of fact... I will make all the arrangements on the phone with my papa tomorrow. Charles will fit right in with us. He has style. And you - you can go right back to that - that hospital of yours... where you can boss everybody around. Now I'm going back to my husband. (Door closes) Damn it, Martha. What have you been saying to Myrtle? Well,we've been talking about quite a few things. Well, what? Well, mostly she's worried about whether you can screw or not. She didn't talk about anything like that. - She certainly did. - Goddamn it! Trouble again! You see? You should have stayed in New York. I never should have let you come. Sure! Then you could do what she wants. I got one woman carrying on in there... another woman carrying on in here! Christ almighty! I'm earning my 4,000 tonight. Now look, this is the third time she came to me. If I wanted to screw her, she would be satisfied by now. I want her to go to sleep. Is that all you want from her? That's all, for Christ's sakes. Then here. Give her these. Tell her that they're the kind of pills she was asking for. I-1- I don't feel any better, Charles. Oh! Oh, I'm so sick. As-as soon as I took all them pills, I - - Once the bus starts, you'll go to sleep. - (Groans) By the time you get to Little Rock, oh, you'll feel much better. - Don't worry. - What - what's the matter with me, Charles? What's the matter with me? Am I - am I gonna die from all those pills? - (Groaning) - No. Myrtle, don't be silly. Relax. You must have been allergic to them. Why are you puttin' me all alone on the bus? I'm so sick, Charles. (Whimpering) I don't wanna go by myself. - I told you. Now listen. - I don't wanna go - Listen. I'll call your mother and father... and tell them to meet the bus. And then I'll drive your car down with all the rest of your things. - OK? - (Stammering incoherently) Don't bring her along. I'm afraid of her. - Don't bring her - - No, no, no. She's going back to New York. I'll come all by myself. Hmm? Just the two of us. - (Sighing) - OK? Oh. Oh, I'm so sick, Charles. Oh, I feel - I feel so terrible. I - I feel so terrible, Charles. Look, it's almost time now. I gotta go. {Whimpering) Go to sleep, huh? Go to sleep. {Whimpering) (Engine starts) Miss? What's the matter? Oh, my God. She's dead! Hello. Operator? Yes. I'd like to make a collect call... to Miss Evelyn Long... 205 Housatonic Street... uh, Pittsfield, Massachusetts. {(Humming) - (Stumbles) - (Coughs) - Be careful. You'll strain yourself. - Don't be silly. It's very nice here, but I wish it was just the two of us. You told me the picture she sent you of her was taken 20 years ago. (Out of breath) Yeah. Most of them do that. How did I know she was gonna be different? You didn't tell me I'd have to stay at a motel all by myself. Well, I didn't know that her house was going to be full of guests... for the music concerts. Well, why can't you stay at the motel too? Come on, Martha. How would that look? Well, anyway, you're not gonna marry her. You promised. We'll go back to New York and find a nice little house in the suburbs. - OK? - Uh-huh. You also didn't know, when she sent you that picture of her mansion... it was only just a boarding house, did you? OK, Martha! Well, what the hell are you complaining about? People who have houses in the suburbs... are supposed to take summer vacations. - So, we're having ours. - What kind of a vacation is it for me? I'm not going back to the hot city yet. Here comes lunch. {Laughing) Uh! (Sighs) I should've let your brother help me get it. I didn't realise it was so hefty. (Sighs) Well, I'm hot. I think I'll join Ray. Will you come? Later. - (Water splashing) - Here I come, ready or not! - Come on. - (Screeches) It's nice, huh? {Laughs) - (Laughing) -Come on. {Laughing) Oh! Whoa! {Whooping) (Screeching, laughing) {Laughing, chattering) That was wonderful, Martha. You should really try it. Yeah, maybe I will. {Sighs) Oh! Martha, I don't think you're having a very good time. Well, since you asked. I don't like staying at that motel by myself. I know, and I do feel terrible. But this is the last week of Tanglewood, and then everybody will go home.. And then I'll have room for you too. I was lucky I even had room enough for Ray. Well, [ have slept in the same room as my brother before. That was long ago when we were still children. {Laughs) Well, shall we have our picnic? - I'm starved. - Well, I'm hot. I think I'll go in and cool off. Yeah, good. Go ahead, Martha. Evelyn and I will get the picnic ready. I'm really sorry. She doesn't seem to be having a very good time. - Don't be silly. - [ wish I could do something to please her. She's moody. It's not your fault. See? Hey, she's enjoying the water. - You want to know something? - What? If you lie down here... no one can see you. My, that's a fascinating piece of information. What's that supposed to mean? Why don't you try it and find out? All right, I will. {Laughing) You promised! - {Ray) What is it? - She saw us. Look. You promised! Martha! Come back! Where's she going? Ray, make her come back. Martha! Please come back. What's the matter with her? Ray, I can't understand what's the matter with her. Martha, please! Please come back! She's out too far. She - she doesn't swim that well. Oh, my God. Martha! Martha! (Mama's voice) Martha? What's the matter with my little girl? - (Martha's voice) Oh, stop it, Mama. - He's the Latin from Manhattan. (Ray's voice) Get rid of her. Choke her! (Woman screaming, indistinct) (Screaming, indistinct) Mama! (Sobbing) {Continues screaming) Mam - {Martha's voice) I went to New York to be married (Myrtle's voice) Little ol' sis, the nurse. (Ray's voice) OK, Martha. I'm not going back to the hot city yet. (Evelyn's voice) Here I come, ready or not. (Echoing) Here I come, ready or not. Here I come, ready or not. Here I come, ready or not. (Gasping) You crazy little fool. - You crazy fool. - (Sobbing) I didn't mean it. (Ray) Are you all right? Are you all right? - {Martha sobbing, gasping) - (Ray) Here, hold on to me. Hold on. {Martha whimpering) (Gasping) - You crazy fool. - (Crying, whimpering) You crazy fool. I didn't mean it. I didn't mean it. You crazy little fool. We're in New York State. Don't be angry with me. And I'm the one who should be angry. Do you realise that, with your stupid jealousy... you could have gotten me into trouble? Huh? You want me to go to jail? I'd rather see you in jail than on that blanket making love to another woman. (Scoffs) You know, you'd go to jail foo. Hmm. Knowing that you were locked up away from other women, I'd go too. Well, I think we'd better get you that house in the suburbs. Hello. Lucy? Janet. Did I wake you? I'm so excited. Listen. I finally got a letter. No, you don't understand. The club. Ah. Charles Martin. Isn't that cute? Well, that's the only thing. He's a little on the young side. Well, 45, Lucy. Oh, dear, and I lied and gave him my age as 56. But it's such a sweet letter. Oh, well, now listen, Lucy. He lives with his sister... and she picked my name out of the list. She told him to write me. No, dear, his sister. Oh, no. They don't live in Albany. Oh, wait a minute. Valley Stream, Long Island. That's a suburb of New York City. He even sent me a picture of the house. Yes, well, remember, Lucy... not a word about all this to Albert and Sarah. I promised I'd forget the Friendship Club... but there's no harm in writing to somebody... who's so gentle and - and refined... and whose sister's a nurse. Mm. Yes, don't they sound wonderful? Well, of course I'm going to answer. This is his first letter through the club - and to me. He's so cute. He calls it his debut letter. All right. What's your advice? Oh, you're right. I was gonna answer right away. You don't think a week's too long? I wouldn't want to hurt his feelings... not for the world. - (Ray) The answer from Fay? -No. Just bills. Her name has been on that list for as long as I can remember. You'd think the old fool would jump when she finally got a nibble. You should've let me write the letter by myself. Maybe it wasn't convincing enough. We haven't paid December for my mother. They're getting nasty. Oh, God. How we could use her 10,000. She's out of town. She'll answer. Eh, maybe. I'd better get back in touch with the Downing woman. No. I'm not going to Michigan. - Besides, she's too young. - What do you mean, too young? - You know what I mean. - Don't eat candy at ten o'clock in the morning. It's because you're making me nervous! You're nervous? How do you think I feel... sitting around here day after day? Now I've even taken to reading these stupid magazines of yours! I thought this is what you wanted. What I wanted? You wanted this house. You almost drowned yourself to get it. I suppose the next thing you'll do is cut your wrists... so I'll go out and get a job. - Stop it! - Or turn on the gas, like the first time. Stop it! Maybe you want me dead! Dead? I'm dead! Finished! They call this place Valley Stream. (Scoffs) What a joke. One little jail after another... with ten feet of grass between them. Valley Stream. I hate it here. We could go some place else. Where could we go? We can't even afford to pay for this rotten little house. I could go back to nursing. How are we gonna live on that? Besides, no woman's going to support me. No! I have to go back to work... and I can't invest everything in one old lady you choose for me. Besides, I detest old ladies. I'm going to write to Delphine Downing today. Look, I told you. When we get enough money, we can get married... and go some place far away from here and settle down. Some place nice. Not Valley Stream. When? If you do as I say, it could be soon. Maybe Fay will answer. Yeah, maybe. But if not, we go to Michigan. If you love me, you'll do it. I want to meet her alone this afternoon. I don't want to bring you into the picture until I see how I'm going to work it. - You understand? - (Martha) Yes. I'll tell her that you're tired from the trip and that you are resting. You think of the 10,000 while I'm gone. That'll help pass the time more quickly. And then tonight, we'll celebrate the New Year. Just the two of us. We'll go some place nice, OK? - What are you doing in there? - You'll see. Here I come. All set. - How do I look? - Mm, a little too old for me... but good enough to eat. Mmm. You know, I think I will rest. I'm tired. Wish me luck and think of that 10,000. {Door opens, closes) - (Door opens) - What happened? First I gotta pee. I'm dying. What were you holding it in for? Where do you find a bathroom in a church? - (Urinating) - What were you doing in a church? We went to pray together, and we lit a candle for the dear departed Mr. Fay... whose loving spirit brought us together. She sounds senile. - (Toilet flushes) - She is getting near that age. She is at least ten years older than she said - sixty-five if she's a day. - She didn't think you were too young for her? - Not at all. I remind her of the late and lamented Mr. Fay when they were married. She doesn't seem to realise how long ago that must have been. She says we have so much in common... that our "little difference of age" doesn't matter. You should have seen her face when I said... - I was also a Catholic. {Laughing) - {Laughing) - You know who she reminds me of? -Who? - Your mother! - My mother's not Catholic! Well, you'd better be tomorrow when you meet Janet. - Tomorrow? -Yes, we're spending the day with her... to celebrate the New Year. What about the 10,0007 She's got it. She can't stop talking about it. She tells me everything. Its in cash and in three banks. And don't you worry, [I get it from the silly old bitch. - Gotta work fast though. - Very good! Who we've gotta watch out for is the daughter and her husband. Yes. And now, what would you like to do most... for the last time in the old year? - Guess. - I'm not too old for you? A man of 457 No. You're not. Fifty nurses under your supervision! Martha, I don't know how you do it. Isn't she wonderful, Lucy? So much responsibility and so young. I should say so! I don't know how the hospital... can do without you for a whole month, Mrs. Beck. Well, I just had to come up and spend some time with my successful brother. When he wrote me about that new house he was buying, I said to myself... "I've got to go up there and talk him out of the idea." At least if he was married - He's my older brother, but he can be impractical. I guess that's because of your European upbringing, Charles. Yes, Janet. My sister was fortunate, being brought up in America... although the separation was terrible for us. Well, I'm glad. You're so... debonair. - So... sort of cute with your little accent! - {Chuckling) And even though you speak differently... I'd know you were brother and sister anywhere. - Wouldn't you, Janet? - Oh, yes, they're like two peas in a pod. I'm having such a good time with these people. I hate to go. But I know the three of you have lots to do. Can I tell her, Charles? Go ahead. Lucy, Charles and I are going to be married. Janet, that's wonderful! I can't believe if! You're the first to know. Except for Martha, of course. Its like a dream. I can't believe it. After all these years. Well, it's not a dream, and you're right... the three of us have a lot to discuss. So I'd better run along. Of course, I'll phone you later this evening. I won't be here. Tonight I'm taking Charles and Martha to dinner. - Oh, how nice! - Call me early tomorrow morning before Mass. Goodbye, you two. It's been a treat meeting you. Congratulations. And happy New Year. Well, how did you like the hat she had on? I made it. (Ray} I know, dear. You wrote me all about them. Would you like to see a new one I just made for myself? - (Martha) Oh, I'd love to, Janet. - Yes, indeed All right. I'll model it for you. Oh! {Martha) Oh, it's beautiful, Janet! And I made it myself. Don't you think it's cute? I do think it's adorable. Janet, with a talent like that, you are missing a golden opportunity. Of course. If you had a little shop in New York. It would have to be in an inexpensive neighbourhood. Where the rent would be reasonable, like, uh, Valley Stream. Oh, Janet, what a business you could have for yourself. - A business? - Why, she'd just rake in the money, wouldn't she? She would indeed. Of course, she would need some capital to get started. Mm. How much money do you think she'd need, Charles? Oh, I'd say about, uh, $10,000. Janet, if you decide to do this, don't worry about money. I have a little savings at home. What better use could I put it to than to help you get started? Oh, Martha, how sweet. How sweet you are, dear. But I don't need it. She doesn't know I have the money, does she, Charles? How wonderful, Janet. Now, you two, just help yourselves to whatever your hearts desire. It's my treat. My! A dollar eighty-five for a veal cutlet. I think I'll have a pork chop. It's a better buy. Pork chop, please. But have whatever you want, Charles. Don't let me influence you. You too, Martha. I'll have the pork chop also, please. And don't skimp on his potatoes like you did on mine. What will you have, Martha dear? Ill have the veal cutlet. I don't care for pork chops. Veal cutlet for her. And go easy on the gravy. It looks starchy. Full of flour. I know this place. I eat here all the time. No! No, that's not the dessert. They're over this way. Come along. I wish I had known you were going to sweep me off my feet... - and take me to New York with you. - Why, dear? Oh, because I never would have paid the hotel for January. Here it is only the first. I'll be checking out on Monday. I think I'll get me another cup of coffee. Oh, here, dear, let me give you the dime. Forget it, Janet. I might want something else. That girl eats too much. Well, she always had a healthy appetite. We could've left first thing tomorrow... - but you want to go to Mass. -Oh, yes. And then you do want to take your money out of the banks first thing Monday morning. You might need some for a deposit at the hat shop. And, as I told you, you get a much better interest rate... at my bank in Valley Stream. (Chuckles) Yes, of course. And then we leave immediately for your new home. {Both chuckling) Well, I'm afraid we're not going to make it... to Valley Stream before the banks close. You see. We shouldn't have stopped all that time for that big lunch. Wasn't necessary. Not at all. I old you, Janet. I get nauseous riding on an empty stomach. - Did you want me to throw up? - Oh, dear. Besides, you took an awfully long time at the bank. It would've been quicker if you had taken all the money out in cash. And ride around with $10,0007 (Scoffs) That's cute. Really, Martha, you don't have as much common sense as I thought. I want my two best girls to stop arguing this very minute. I think I'll look at my beautiful pictures for a while. You're sure there's a nice place for them? Oh yes, of course. We'll hang them up this evening. Good. That's the only thing in Albany I'll miss. My lovely church. Everything I have goes to them, you know. There's a nice Catholic church in Valley Stream too. I'm sure you'll like it. I know I will. But I'll miss St. Agnes. And of course I'll miss Albert and Sarah too. Do you really think it was right leaving like this without telling them a word? Sure. Think of the exciting surprise it will be tomorrow when you call them... and tell them, "I am now Mrs. Charles Martin." (Laughs) "Mrs. Charles Martin." Martin's Hat Shop. Isn't that cute? There they are, safe and sound in your new home. That was a delicious supper, Martha. Are you sure I can't help you now that we have the pictures up? No, dear. You and Charles have business to attend to. Go ahead and use the table if you like. I'll clean up in the kitchen. That's a good idea. Janet, why don't you get your purse? We can go over everything together right now. All right. (Ray) Fine. I suggest you deposit it in one lump sum in my bank. But you better keep a thousand in cash... in case we find a nice store for you. They might not take a cheque. Even with your references? - I don't know everyone in Valley Stream, darling. - All right. {Janet) But the jewellery goes in a safe-deposit box. (Ray) Not until after the wedding. I want my bride to look her very loveliest. (Janet, laughing} Oh, yes. Of course. Now what are you writing on those sheets of paper? I have a marvellous idea. - "Surprise"? - Just sign your name at the bottom of the page. And then what happens? And then I take them out tonight and I mail them. One to your daughter Sarah, one to Lucy... and one to Father Nicholas at St. Agnes. They get them tomorrow morning. "What's this from Janet?" they say. "Surprise"? What does that mean?” Then they ring each other up on the telephone. "Surprise'? What's the surprise?" And then first thing tomorrow morning... we print up some wedding announcements. Mr. and Mrs. Charles Martin take pleasure in announcing their marriage... January 3rd in Valley Stream, Long Island. Mrs. Martin is the former Janet Fay of Albany, New York. After a wedding trip to Miami, Florida... they will make their home in Valley Stream, Long Island, New York. A wedding trip... to Miami, Florida? I might as well tell you now. That was my surprise for you. Oh. Oh, Charles! How wonderful! (Chuckling) "Surprise”. {Laughs) What a cute idea! {Ray} While you have your fountain pen in hand... - why don't you endorse the cheques? - Endorse them tonight? (Ray) I have to be out of the house very early in the morning. To get the wedding announcements printed in time. I could stop at the bank first thing and put them in for you. Oh, Charles, you better hide them. Oh, yes. I have a nice secret place in the cellar. I'll take them down there this very minute. And now, why don't you address the envelopes for the surprise letters... so I can mail them when I come back up? We need another surprise letter for my nephew in Utica. Fine. Do a few more. We can always use an extra one or two. Martha, you'd better come down the cellar with me. You can help me hide Janet's cheques. (Janet) Don't you want me to help, dear? No, darling. It's very dark down there. You might hurt yourself on the stairs. You finish addressing your letters while we do it. All right. If I didn't see it, I wouldn't believe it. What do you mean, you wouldn't believe it? You saw. That is what you get for being kind to a woman and giving her affection. I bolted the door from the inside. (Door rattles) {Janet) Charles, what's the matter? I can't open the door. Are you all right down there? One minute, Janet. I'll be right up. I'll be right back. {Door rattling) (Ray) The catch slipped. We're locked in down here. Oh, dear God. Can't I open it from this side? Oh, Janet, it won't open. My goodness! Shall I get help? No, no. There's an outside entrance down here from the backyard. But it's locked also, and it's gonna take me some time to get it open, dear. You might as well get ready for bed in the meantime. Oh, poor Martha. She's so tired. Oh, she's fine. Martha doesn't mind a bit. What's the matter? Can't you sleep? No, I'm terribly restless. I guess I'm not used to a strange bedroom. - Do you want a sleeping pill? - No. No, I never take pills. Not even aspirin. That's too bad. Oh, I'm keeping you up. I'm sorry. You must be tired, locked up in the cellar for over an hour. Janet, what's worrying you? Well, the outside cellar door - the one you and Charles got out of - do you recall whether you locked that behind you? We have quite a bit of money here in the house to be sleeping with a door unlocked. All the doors are locked tight. Now go back to sleep. You have a big day tomorrow. I'll try. Do you think poor Charles is all right on that little couch in there? He's fine. Now, do you have any more questions, or can I go to sleep? Well, if you weren't so tired... I would like to have a little talk with you. About what? Well, about your brother. And about you too, I suppose. What about us? Well, here I am sleeping under the same roof with you, and I hardly know you. What do you want to know about us? Well, I really know hardly anything about Charles. Well, about his past for instance. Don't you think 2:00 in the morning is a little late for family histories? Well, here I've endorsed all my cheques... and now I don't even know where they are. For God's sakes, Janet. You asked him to hide them for you in the cellar. I know. But now I don't even know where they are. And you were down there such a long time. We were locked in! I know. But right after you came up, Charles went out to mail my letters... and you and I came to bed and nobody told me where you put them. Do you want me to take you down there and show them to you? {(Martha) I'm not going to. The door from the kitchen is stuck, or don't you remember? {(Janet} Maybe Charles isn't asleep yet. Maybe he'll show them to me. {Martha) I wouldn't repeat to my brother some of the things you just said to me. I don't think he'd want to marry a woman who doesn't trust him. Now you get back into bed... and go to sleep, and I won't tell him about this conversation. I can't sleep. I'm very upset. What are you upset about now? I should have called Albert and Sarah. I should have told them what I was doing. They probably phoned the hotel and were told I checked out. They're probably worried to death about me right this minute. They'll get the surprise letters in the morning. How do you know about the letters? You weren't even in the room when we did them. I overheard you from the kitchen. Why were you eavesdropping on us? Janet, what's the matter with you? I wish you'd let me give you a sleeping pill. You're getting yourself all upset over nothing. - No. I wanna use the telephone. Where is it? - What do you want the phone for? {Janet) I wanna speak to Albert and Sarah, tell them where I am. (Martha) You can't. The phone is in the living room... and you're not gonna wake my brother. - You can do it in the morning - (Janet) No. I wanna do it now. I want Sarah's advice about those cheques I signed over to your brother. You get back into bed, and we'll settle it all in the morning. -Why can't I call her now? - Because it's late. That's why. - You'll upset her. - She won't be upset. She'll be glad to hear from me. (Martha) I said you can call her in the morning. Now get back into bed! Janet, I'm going to give you a few sleeping pills. (Janet) No. No pills. Don't push me like that! No! I want to call this minute. - {Hand slaps) - (Whimpering) For God's sakes, Ray, give this woman back her cheques. Take her to the train and send her back to Albany! Ray? Ray? Who's Ray? Who's R - [ want to call my daughter! She won't let me. She slapped me. Why is she calling you "Ray"? (Crying) I'm frightened. She wants her cheques back. I heard. Oh, no. [ don't want them back, Charles. I just want to call Sarah. I don't want her to worry about me. That's all. Can't I call her? Please, Charles, can't I call her? I'll call her and surprise her now, all right? She's worried about me. Please, let me call her! First, let Martha give you a few pills. You're very upset. They'll help calm you down. And then you can call your daughter! No! No pills. Why do you want to give me pills? I'm afraid of pills! (Martha) Ray, what are we gonna do with her? Ray? Ray? I-I don't want the cheques back. No, I don't want them back. A-a-and I'm not going to call Sarah. Al right? All right, Ray? I just wanna go for a little walk by myself to think things over. I just want to get a little fresh air, and then I'll be right back. I don't want the cheques. Leave them in your cellar where you hid them. Please, go to bed! I'll be right back. I'll just take my jewellery out of this trunk and put it in my overcoat. That's all. Where is it? Oh, where is it? I can't find it! It isn't in here! Somebody took my jewellery. Where is it? I can't find it. It isn't in here. I don't want it. - You've got to do it. - (Martha) No, I don't want to. If you love me, you'll do it. (Janet) I won't take anything with me! Nothing at all! I won't even get dressed. -No! - (Screams) {Whimpering) (Ray) Hit her again! - (Gags) - (Martha) Finish her! (Yelling, straining) (Martha) Here. Tie it on and let her have it. - (Martha) And get her off the rug! - (Groaning) (Gasping) {(Whimpers) - Here. Use this as a tourniquet. - Help me. (Straining) - Oh, God! - You're shivering. Do you have a fever? - What's the matter? - Nothing. It's just that you're sweating so. (Breathing heavily) Take off your top. It's wet. You'll catch a cold. For God's sake, Martha, put out the light. Be calm. Nobody knows what happened. Only you and me. I want to go lie down for a while. I need a drink! {Martha) Do you want the light on or off? Leave it on. I want to make love. (Ray) "Dear Sarah and Albert - (Typewriter clicking) "By the time you receive this letter... "I will be Mrs. Charles Martin... "on my way to Florida... where I will live with my new husband.” Wait a minute. She always takes these with her wherever she goes. (Objects clattering) Now isn't that cute? "Dear Charles, thank you for your thoughtful Christmas greetings. "Christmas gives me an empty, lonely feeling. "Rainelle finally got a tricycle for Christmas. "She just can't wait for spring to use it. "She is anxious to meet her Uncle Charles... "and was very happy when I told her that you and Aunt Martha... were thinking of coming out here for a visit." "And so, boys and girls, on the 15th of April... "in the year 1865, Abraham Lincoln... "the 16th president of the United States of America, died. "Each year on February the 12th, his birthday... a grateful country celebrates the hero who saved the Union." What's "celebrates," Mommy? Well, "celebrates” is what we did today for Lincoln's Birthday, sweetheart. You stayed home from nursery school, didn't you? And we had flags at the supper table. And we even had a birthday cake for President Lincoln. - Right. - What a bad man who shot President Lincoln. Oh, well, I guess he was sorry for what he did. Is Daddy in heaven a hero like President Lincoln? Yes, darling. And now Mommy's gonna put you to bed. Go kiss Uncle Charles and Aunt Martha good night. Ah! Why, Rainelle, what's the matter with you? She'll never forgive me for swabbing her throat. But she had that cold three weeks ago. Tsk tsk tsk. Oh, Rainelle, and Aunt Martha was going... to buy you that puppy that you want so badly. Al right, young lady, come to bed. You're overtired, I guess. I'll just take her upstairs and put her to bed. I'll be right down. Now, Rainelle, why did you do that? {Continues, indistinct) A birthday party for President Lincoln. Now I've seen everything. Shh. She'll hear you. If we stay here much longer, she'll have me sewing flags like Betsy Ross. - Who's Betsy Ross? - Oh, never mind. Come into the den where we can talk. I'm sick of her and that goddamn health food. I'm hungry all the time. And in more than one way. We're going to Grand Rapids tomorrow, hmm, for a shopping trip. Just you and me. I'm as hungry as you, darling. Be patient a little while longer. You've been saying that for three weeks. No. She told me this afternoon she's very close to a deal... on the property on Muskegon Street. I thought you were her financial adviser. I am. But, you know, she's not stupid. So I've got to take it slow and easy with her. Listen, she's got even more than we thought. He had plenty of insurance. She never wrote me the half of it. That's why it's taking time to turn everything info cash. - And then? - Ah, and then - She thinks we're driving to New York where I marry her. But we get rid of her and the kid on the way. She's in love with you. I can tell. So what? It's perfect, if you'll just be patient for a little while longer. And after that, no more letters and no more meetings. No more. I promise. We get married. OK? Charles, it's funny you should always come in here. Why do you say that, Delphine? Well, because John always preferred coming in here... instead of sitting in the living room. He used to say it was more cosy. You know, that is funny. Because I feel the same way. {Laughs) Well, guess what we celebrate day after tomorrow. - President Washington's Birthday? - Oh, no, dear. - That's not until the 22nd. - Oh. But at least you got it in the right month. Charles is pulling your leg, Delphine. As a matter of fact, he just asked me to drive into Grand Rapids... tomorrow afternoon to help pick out your Valentine's Day present. (Delphine) Oh, Charles. Oh, that's sweet of you! I wonder if Rainelle found her puppy. They should be back by now. My goodness, how that child needs a father. She's really taken to Charles. Don't you think so? I suppose so. But if you ask me, you've spoiled her. You fuss too much over her. Like this morning. She could have gone to nursery school. I old you there was nothing wrong with her stomach. You got yourself so upset over her that now you're the one who's sick. I guess we just didn't want you to go to Grand Rapids today. Rainelle wanted Charles to buy the puppy... - and I wanted to be here alone with you. - What for? I have to talk to you, Martha. It's important. - I'm afraid I need your advice. - What's the matter? - May I be completely open and frank with you? - Well, of course. What is it? I want to marry your brother right away, before we go to New York. Why do you want to do that? Because I'm pregnant. That's why. Martha, Charles and I really do love each other. We intended to marry almost from the start. I guess we just got carried away. That's all. But you see, the thing is, I don't want him to know about this until after we're married. I don't want the fact that I'm going to have his child have anything to do with it. That's why I need your help. Well, after all, you'll be my sister. I never had a sister. {Martha) What do you want me to do, Delphine? I want you to suggest that we get married here, right away. Tomorrow. On Valentine's Day. - He promised me. - Look, I know you're upset. He wanted to be so sure that you wouldn't find out... that there was anything going on between us. I think you're wonderful, Martha, with your old-fashioned values. Charles does, too, and he's just frightened to death... that you'd find out we've been sleeping together whenever you left the house. But we love each other so much, we just couldn't stop ourselves. You can understand that, can't you? Yes, I understand. Martha, why are you crying? I'm crying because I feel so sorry for you. Sorry for me? W-Why? Why should you feel sorry for me? I'm sorry for you because my brother will never marry you now. That's why. - What do you mean? - You'll find out when you tell him... he has to marry you because he's knocked you up. - You make it sound so awful. - Well, that's the situation, isn't it? Well, then you've got to help me, Martha. He mustn't know. You want me to lie to my own brother? Never. You've ruined everything. Oh, God. Oh, what am I gonna do? - (Crying) - You're in quite a spot, aren't you? Besides losing Charles, you'll be pregnant without a husband. All right. I'll help you. But you've got to do exactly as 1 ell you. Get into bed. I'll be right back. (Door opens) (Tap running) (Bottle cap clatters) - Here, take these. - What are they? They're allergy pills. But if you take enough of them, they'll abort the baby. - No, I don't want to do that, - Delphine, don't be stupid. You'll have another child after you're married. This'll solve the problem. They won't make me sick, will they? Would I give them to you if I thought they would? Now hurry up before I change my mind. Here, you'll have to take more. You need more than those. Uh-oh! I think I have to go into the bathroom for a minute. Swallow them! Swallow them, stupid! - Here, take some more. - I don't have to. (Giggles) It was a false alarm. Oh, my goodness. I feel woozy. I think I'd better get into bed. Oh! Oh, Martha... I don't feel good. (Screams, struggles) (Door opens) (Rainelle) Mommy! Mommy! Look at the puppy! - (Screams) - Shut up, Rainelle! -Run! - What the hell's going on here? Watch her. I'll be right back. Help me. Help me. {Footsteps approaching) {Martha) I put the kid in the bedroom closet. - (Ray) What happened to her? - She found out everything - What! How? - How the hell do I know, Ray? She was gonna call the police. - You gave her the pills? - But I couldn't get enough down her. What are you gonna do with her? She keeps a gun in that drawer. Get it. (Footsteps) (Drawer opening, closing) (Footsteps) {Gunshot) (Rainelle crying) While I take care of her, you'd better think of a way to get rid of that kid. -How? - How do I know? Take her to a children's home. Are you kidding? They'd ask millions of questions, and she's no baby. So put a pillow over her face. Uh, smother her. I don't care what you do, but get rid of her. {Crying continues) (Tap running) You might as well come upstairs. There's no point in digging twice. (Martha) See, I told you she wasn't in her bed anymore. Now take off your coat, and I'll leave it on the bed. {Footsteps approaching) Mommy's all right now. We were only playing a game to fool you. (Rainelle) I want my mommy! I want my mommy! {Martha) She's in the cellar with the nice little puppy... that Uncle Charles bought for you. You remember, she said the puppy would have to stay in the cellar, didn't she? Shall we go down to see Mommy playing with the puppy in the cellar? Come on, Rainelle. Hurry up. Go see Mommy. {Footsteps departing) - (Rainelle screams) - (Water splashes) {Footsteps approaching) You can go down now. Everything's taken care of. Go upstairs and pack while [ finish up down - We better get out of here fast. Where are we going now, Ray? I can arrange a meeting with a very nice woman in New Orleans. We can stay there right through the Mardi Gras. Wouldn't you like that, sweetheart? Yes, darling, I'd like that. Hold me. - And you won't make love to her? - (Scoffs) Do you have to ask that again? Didn't I promise? I didn't touch Delphine, did 1? After a whole month, I never laid a hand on her. Don't you trust me? Yes, I trust you, my darling. We'll spend the rest of the winter in New Orleans. This one will be the absolute last. I promise. And then in the spring - Huh. {Phone dialling) Get me the police. Hello, is this the police? This is a neighbour of Mrs. Delphine Downing... 3435 Byron Center Road. Something's wrong over there. How do I know? I heard a shot. That's how I know. And now something peculiar is going on in the cellar. 3435. That's right. Never mind who [ am. Just get over there. (Sighs) (Doorbell chimes) {Footsteps approaching) Who is it? Just one of her neighbours, I expect. Well, get rid of them! And finish packing! You won't need that now. Besides, I never liked it on you anyway. {Doorbell chiming) Go downstairs. I'll take care of everything. - Hello, Martha. - Time to go to court? - Are you nervous? - Yes. Well, first day's the worst. It's going to be a long trial. You'll get used to it. At least I'll see Ray again. It's been four months now. They tell me he sill loves me, but - They've been telling me so many lies, I don't know who to believe any more. Well, then, I have something nice for you. It's a letter from him. They're allowing me to give it to you. Can I be alone with it, please? [I... wait for you over there by the window. {Ray's voice) "Dear Martha... I would like to shout my love for you to the world. Perhaps some day when we are old and grey... we shall have a little time to spend together. But no matter what happens to us... I want you to remember one thing. You, and you alone... are the one and only woman I have ever loved. You are the one and only woman I will ever love. Now and beyond the grave. Ray.
