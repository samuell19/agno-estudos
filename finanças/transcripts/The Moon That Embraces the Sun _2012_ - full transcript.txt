Your Excellency should be the one to take His Majesty's head. You want me to personally take His Majesty's head? That's the only way to show courage in order to boost the people's morale. Only when my sword is tainted with my brother's blood, will they acknowledge me as King? Besides... this land of Joseon wasn't it established on the bloodshed among brothers? So, using this opportunity to show my determination, is probably a good idea. I agree. All of you listen carefully. Heaven demands the death of this King, so that he may be replaced by someone more worthy. At this time, we will obey the will of heaven, and abolish this incompetent King! Hurry! Take the head of the useless King! Why are you still hesitating? I told you to take off my head! Hyeongnim, you've wasted your opportunity today. In future, don't again look for another chance. No, that's not it. For me there will be another opportunity. That will be at the scene of a rebellion. What I would do the moment when the rebellion starts, isn't that what you want to know? Quickly tell me. What exactly is Your Majesty planning? Why are you still hesitating, Your Excellency? He is a tyrant that has violated the Laws of the God! For the sake of the heavens, quickly chop off his head! I plan to hold a hunt. For those who conspired to kill that child. For those who used her death to cling to power. For those who sacrificed the lives of the innocent. Those ministers who placed themselves before this nation and its citizens. For all of them, we must capture them in one clean sweep. These people will not sit idly by and allow all this to happen. I know this. If I do not give up the throne, they will plot a rebellion. Furthermore, soon they will look for you, hyeongnim. Then what do you want me to do? I need a list of the names of all the conspirators. If we do not destroy them all, Yeon U will live her life in constant danger. This country will also be heading down a path to ruin. How can you trust me enough to speak such dangerous words? I am willing to place my life in your hands. But to plan a rebellion is not a simple task. Of course, the decision is up to you, hyeongnim. Charge forward! It's His Majesty's special army! Let the hunt begin! Charge! Whoever kills the King, and Prince Yang Myung, will be greatly rewarded! Your Highness! It's Court Lady Jo! Your Majesty, there is a rebellion! We must leave at once... Your Majesty. Father. Are you determined to fight to the bitter end? Although I don't know which one of you will be victorious, but it is certain that my position as the Queen will be taken from me. Since the day I first met Your Majesty, I have wanted only one thing. That was to have your heart. And so as a Queen to the end, I will die as Your Majesty's woman. Kill Prince Yang Myung, and retrieve the book of names! The book is with me! If you can kill me, then come and get it! Your Majesty! Hyeongnim! Your Majesty. Please forgive me for my selfish decision. There can only be one Sun in the sky. From now on, there will no longer be chaos because of me. Hyeongnim... Hyeongnim! Orabeoni! Ah, I am actually lying in your arms. It feels really good. Why? Why did you? I was tired of my free-spirited lifestyle. It had started to be really boring! If there's anything I regret, it would be that I haven't seen Yeom for far too long. Your Majesty... How can you shed tears for something as trivial as this? Please don't cry. I'm not all that important. This was the list of names you had asked for. I know. I know. Now don't move. The physician is on his way here. You must keep going on. I once resented you, Your Majesty, Resented you for having everything. And so I did harbor thoughts of taking your position. However, compared to your position as King, My friends... and my brother... are much more precious to me. Hyeongnim. Please, you have to be a strong King. And together with that child you have to protect the people of this nation. Your servant... will watch and protect you... from another place. Father. I, your son, am coming to see you. I hope that in the next life you will not be my king, but just my father, so that I can show you a child's smile. My only regret is... leaving behind my lonely mother. Are you going somewhere? I came to see you once more before I leave. What an ugly face. I've taken a good look. I'm leaving now. Hyeongnim... Hyeongnim... Hyeongnim... Hyeongnim... Hyeongnim. Hyeongnim, please open your eyes. I only asked you to get the list of names. I didn't ask you to die! Hyeongnim. Hyeongnim... Hyeongnim, please open your eyes. This is a royal command. How can you disobey a royal command? Hyeongnim... Hyeongnim. Hyeongnim. Hyeongnim! We were afraid we might be followed, so it took a little longer. However, we have arrived now. You may alight now, agasshi. Where is this place? His Majesty asked me to bring you here. You must be tired from this trip, so please go inside. Mo... ther... Yeon U... Are you...? Are you really Yeon U ? Really... Are you Yeon U? My child. You're really still alive.... Still alive... Is this real or is it a dream? How could... something like this happen? I did not expect to see you again. Mother... Orabeoni. My child! First help mother to her room. A while ago, I saw a young lady who looked just like you. I don't know what kind of crime she had committed, but seeing people throw stones at her, gave my heart so much pain. We can talk about these things later. You should rest now. No, I can't. With you by my side now, how can I just go to sleep? I'm afraid that if I sleep, you'll disappear again. How can that be? In the future, I won't go anywhere, except with your permission. How did this happen? For the past eight years, the princess took your place and was with me. But, she was actually responsible for your death? I can't believe it. Orabeoni told you? Although she committed such a sin, she is carrying our own family's flesh and blood. How can he treat her like this? Orabeoni! Are you really not going to look at me, Orabeoni? If you blame yourself, then I may regret being alive now. Do you really want me to think like that? I've committed an unforgivable sin towards you. How could you say that? It's not your fault. It all started because of me... Everything happened because of me. Please don't say something like that. Just please be happy for me, for being alive and well. Yeon U. Thank you, for being alive. And I thank you too. Thank you for being alive. Didn't I say that I won't eat anything? Court Lady Min, why don't you listen to what I say? Why aren't you eating? What right do I have to eat? So do you want to die together with your child? I.... Don't you wish for me to die? No. I want you to go on living. You're lying! That would never happen. I was the one who tried to kill you! Then how could you now want me to live? Although you wanted to kill me, right now I am alive and well. Although there was a time when I resented you, and I even hoped you would die. However, because you were around, my mother was able to smile again, and my orabeoni is able to gain a child. Don't be a hypocrite in front of me! It would be better for you to yell at me and tell me to die, while tearing at my clothing. At least in this way, I can kneel in front of you, and beg for your forgiveness. Do you need my forgiveness? Fine, I'll forgive you. For the sake of those who have suffered pain because of you, His Majesty and my brother. They asked me for forgiveness on your behalf. For you, they bear guilt that is not deserved. For them I will happily forgive you. Therefore, please continue to live. Please stay alive and seek my forgiveness personally. And endure your punishment personally. In order to atone for your crime. His Majesty and my brother should not have to bear the guilt for you. Step up and do it by yourself. You are alive. For staying alive, thank you. Then please, give me a reason to say the same. Prince Yang Myeong. Please open your eyes. Prince Yang Myeong. Please don't sleep anymore. Open your eyes and look at me. Who told me such a lie? Aren't you smiling at me? Is he still not alive? Prince Yang Myeong. Please wake up. Why do you joke around like this? You cannot be like this. You will scare your mother. Prince Yang Myeong. Please open your eyes, Prince Yang Myeong... Please wake up, Prince Yang Myeong... Prince Yang Myeong... Aigoo... Look at him. Today even the incomparable swordsman, Un, is looking dejected. Prince Yang Myeong... Is it possible that...you... ? In such a short time, have you missed me already? Over there, are you happy? Of course I'm happy. I don't need to pretend to smile. Also, I never really liked drinking. So now I don't have to force myself to drink anymore. I'm no longer a threat to His Majesty. And the most important thing, I can love my Yeon U as much as I wish. Do you know that it is a very good feeling? Can I... ask you one thing? Yes, just say it. Even now do you still, do you think of me as a friend? A friend... The word "friend" always sounds good. And please answer me, Did you come.... as a friend? Of course. So far I have always done so. In the future, you will also be my friend. Your Highness, Your Highness... Your Highness, Your Highness... Your Highness, Your Highness... Your Highness, Your Highness. Your Highness... This time of disorder has affected the whole nation. The most important thing now is to reassure the people. Concentrate on handling the aftermath and then stabilize the nation, by harnessing the country's strengths and eliminating its weaknesses. We'll keep that in mind. In addition, during this period of confusion, the personal sacrifices of innocent people and their suffering, I will definitely never forget. Gong Yang's Spring and Autumn Annals have said, "The sin hasn't been determined, hence the punishment can't be decided yet." The right must thoroughly be distinguished from wrong to prevent innocent people from being wrongly accused. Those people who have committed a crime will also be given appropriate punishment. Therefore, Princess Min Hwa, having been involved eight years ago, in endangering the Crown Princess, will be punished. She will lose her status, and be demoted to a slave. Her sentence will begin after the birth of her child. I decree, that after the birth of her child, she is to be expelled from the capitol city and be demoted to the status of a slave. Uibin of YangCheon, Heo Yeom, by virtue of being married to the criminal, Min Hwa, will also be punished. I decree they will divorce. -=Divorce - meaning that he is no longer related to the Royal family and returns to his former status=- Thus, revoking his title of Uibin. His properties gained through the marriage will be confiscated. He will return to his former status before his marriage to the Princess. He will be made a state official without current assignment. Head Shaman. Eight years ago, the Celestial Hall Shaman Jang Nok Yeong, who performed witchcraft, should now be punished by beheading. But considering that she saved the Crown Princess, after the memorial rituals have been completed, the execution will be reconsidered. I'm letting you all know in advance, the memorial rituals will begin soon, so go and prepare. For this ritual, I'll complete it alone. It's not necessary for you to exhaust yourself for all of this. I want to follow you, Shinmu. You... just stay here at Celestial Hall. I would like you to stay behind, and protect this place. I don't want to be by myself. I don't have Seol eonni. Wol eonni, has become a person who is difficult to even see. Yang Myeong orabeoni, also has left this world. If even Shinmu is not around... Don't leave, Shinmu. Don't leave me alone here. Seol. And Great Queen Dowager. Your Highness, the Queen. Prince Yang Myeong. Chief Scholar. I will assist you along the road to the next world. Dear Heaven, as a sinful person, I present the rest of my life as an offering for you. I ask you to please cleanse this land of the lingering grief and air of evil. I will take all of the evils of this land into my body, and bring it with me on my road to the next world. Pitiful souls, please let go of your resentment, and rest in peace. Today, in the heavens above, there is a hopeful sun, with one moon. I hope they can make all of the people of this land, able to bathe in its radiant light. I hope that everyone can wash away their pain. Everyone can obtain happiness. I pray for this now. Shinmu... It's fine. All of you can leave. Please forgive me, Your Majesty. Before it's a favorable time for conception, you definitely can't-- Didn't I tell you all to leave? Then, Your Highness' robe... Where are you placing your hands? Even the Queen has not touched this yet. The Queen will assist me. So you may leave. Everyone has left now, so lift your head up. Who are you? Quickly tell me. Who are you exactly? I am... I'm Your Majesty's woman, and this nation's mother. I am Heo Yeon U. Don't run! You can't catch me! Stop! Orabeoni. Yes, Your Highness. Do you have something to tell me? It's about Princess Min Hwa... Please forgive her. She already paid the price for her actions. His Majesty has pardoned her. Court Lady Min who served by her side, just passed away recently. If you are still feeling sorry to me, you need not. It's not because of that. Most importantly, a child... needs a mother. Are you all right? Yes, Mother. Our Prince is really lively. Father. Royal Prince, you must be happy to have Ui come to the palace to play, right? Did you play happily? Yes, we played happily. Un, will you teach me sword fighting? This kid! Do you like Un more than your father? Did those two enjoy playing together after not seeing each other for so long? Yes, Your Majesty. Even when the Prince is feeling down, he really likes to be close to Ui. It really makes a person happy. Ui, why didn't you go together with the Royal Prince? I prefer reading books more than fighting with swords. How can you be so much like your father? He's so sensible and smart for his age. He's really just like you, Teacher. Reading is the only thing that I know how to do. In contrast, our Prince is playful and carefree. He is very much like Prince Yang Myeong. Even in the way he likes Un. Brothers resemble each other, so he must also be like you, Your Majesty. Ui. Yes, Father. Do you miss your mother? Why are you asking me this? You were watching the Queen and the Prince with envy. Could it be that Father saw it wrongly? It's all right, you can be honest. Are you... the Queen's brother? I am. Is there something wrong? Do you know Seol eonni? How did you know Seol? Seol eonni... everyday, she asks the same question. Are you happy? Is the Young Master happy? He has to be happy. Every day she repeats these words. Are you happy? Thank you for pardoning Princess Min Hwa. That's not something you should thank me for. Even though you refused it several times, I kept asking you for it. Did I possibly make you angry? Princess Min Hwa's release was due to your kind consideration for me and your brother. How can I be angry? On the contrary, I should be thankful to you for this. - Your Majesty. - Please say it. Actually... with my grateful heart, I have hidden a present here for Your Majesty. A present? That's right. I have a really busy day today, with a lot of scrolls to read. I'll be leaving now. But, the scrolls are here... Ah, right. These scrolls should be read at the King's Quarters. You should rest early, my Queen. It's strange. Usually when His Majesty comes, he will not even leave unless Hyeong Seon calls him. What can be the matter? Their relationship has always been so good. Don't tell me that he's already tired of her after only such a short time. Could it be that.. he's hiding another woman in his chambers? That couldn't be! Are you ready? Yes. Then, come out. This is a famous Gayageum teacher, Jong Yeon. -=Gayageum - A twelve-stringed zither (instrument)=- It's not long before the Queen's birthday. I would like to show my musical ability to the Queen. Therefore, you must teach me quickly. I'll do my best. I am a fast learner, so it shouldn't be a problem. This instrument is broken. Go get me another one! Allow me test it for you. There's nothing wrong with the instrument. This gayageum... When did you learn to play it? This? I have never learned to play it. While Your Majesty was learning, I sat next to you and watched. I practice it to pass the time when I am bored. To...pass the time. Turn around. Your Majesty. Although I've been released from my status as a slave, I have nowhere else to go. I just wanted to... see you again... for the last time. I missed you so much. I originally just wanted to see you from afar and then leave. Mother? I won't come here again. I won't hide and watch you again. So... Please forgive me just this once. I thought... you would never forgive me. I didn't want to forgive you. I was trying to punish myself by not forgiving you. But now, I want to be happy. For the sake of our child, and for one who is dead but still wishes for my happiness. Those pitiful people. The order I gave you, has it been completed? Yes, it has. According to the Queen's wishes, her birthday celebration feast has been cancelled. The money for that celebration, has been sent to fund the infirmary. Well done. How is the situation at the West Infirmary? Because of the Queen's involvement, she has become a role model. Other noblewomen have also begun to raise funds for the Infirmary. Your Majesty, Your Majesty. Is anything currently worrying you? Huh? It's nothing. Your Highness, may I come in? Come in. Your Highness. His Majesty requests you to come to the Secret Moon Pavilion now. Go to the Secret Moon Pavilion? Please sit here, Your Highness. Happy birthday. For my Queen, I prepared a musical concert. Although my skills are not the best, I hope you will enjoy it. Are you all right? Please focus on me. Only on me. My gift did not turn out very well. Are you disappointed? I'm not. It was very amusing. I did not intend for it to be amusing... But, I will give you another gift. Don't tell me... there will be flower petals falling from the rooftop? Hyeong Seon is getting too old to climb on rooftops. Well then... could there be fireworks that burst in the sky? To win a woman's favor, how can I waste the citizens' money? But... I will give you something better than all of those. -= Thank you to everyone who watched and loved " The Moon that Embraces the Sun "=- -=Review=- Yeon U, Yeon U! I've really found you again, Yeon U. Haven't you already given me your heart? From this day forward, I'll be by your side protecting you. Even if everyone becomes the Crown Prince's people, it's okay, as long as you, Heo Yeon U, belong with me. Come a little closer to me. A little more. Today... the two can finally become one. You told me to forget you. You hoped that I forgot you, right? I'm sorry. I wanted to forget you, but I couldn't do it. Lee Jae Ha, from today onwards you're banished from the palace. Why must you try so hard at WOC? There's a female too? My name is Gim Hang A. Is that how you treat a guest? One room will do. Actually, I'm also a woman that's like a delicate flower. It looks like you didn't unintentionally do this. This time... you're dead. -=They were once enemies.=- -=Can they really become a team?=-
