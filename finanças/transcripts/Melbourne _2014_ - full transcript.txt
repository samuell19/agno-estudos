Go inside. Amir, I am scared. Sara! - Hello, sir. - Hello. - I am Mosayebi. - Yes, how are you? I am really sorry. I didn't realize Tina was here with you, otherwise I'd come back earlier.

Yes, yes, I already told your colleague, I just spoke to him now... Yes, it was me, I spoke with him, I told him everything was ok. Yes completely. Thanks very much, bye. Why do you keep calling me? I'll do as I please, it's none of your business. What?! You can't do a thing about it, that's the way it is. I'll take it all the way. Yes... it's none of your business. I'll know what to say when the time comes. Look... I have nothing else to lose. watch what you're saying, lower your voice. Let's see what the hell you can do, I'm telling you... Don't raise your voice. Listen... listen... don't you dare hang up... - I am really sorry, I apologize. - Let me see. I'm sorry. I couldn't control myself. I am all alone these days, my job on the one hand. And the baby, her mother's away on a trip that's why... I'll go home for a second, if your wife comes back, please... Ok. Thanks. Sure. I am really sorry. Did the nanny say anything before she left? She's never done this before. I'm not sure, she spoke with my wife. Ok, I'll call her myself. Bye. I couldn't. Why did you say I had taken her out? How are you going to tell him now? I don't know... I just couldn't. Amir, he'll be back soon. What did the nanny say exactly when she left the baby here? She was in a rush, said she'll be back soon. She had to take care of something. And? She said she'll tell the father that she's left the baby here. She hasn't been back for 3 hours. And the father said he hadn't heard anything from her. You turn off your cellphone and think that I can't find you? I'll find you wherever you hide! I'll ruin your life! Mostafa let him go, let him go, move aside. Do you know what I went through in this time? Do you realize what you did to me? May God not forgive you. - Officer, come here. - Mr. Mosayebi? - Where is my baby? - Ma'am I'll ask the questions. I haven't seen her for two weeks. I don't even know where she is. Hold on, I will ask. Mr. Mosayebi, the court has given the mother full custody, You have to hand over the baby to it's mother, where is she? Sir... I'm talking to you, where is the baby? Out of town, with my mother. Officer he's lying. I swear to God that he's lying. I know she's in there. Sir, I need to look inside the apartment. Sara... Sara, was the baby awake when you took her from the nanny? No. Think carefully, did she move when you took her... Did she make a sound? Move? What do you mean by move? Did she take a deep breath? or move somehow... I don't know, maybe... No... - Sara, you don't know, or no? - No, I don't know. It's very important. Think, when you were putting it on the bed... Did it move it's hands, or... Amir, I swear, I don't know... I really... don't know. Ok. Officer what if she's not there? - Come along sir, come on. - But we can't... Hold this a minute. - Did you take everything? - Yes. What if we go all the way over there and he's lying? Come along. - We can't be made fools of... - Come on, Mr. Mosayebi, come along. This is a real nuisance. Sara! So when I took her from the nanny... That's why she was so agitated. She handed the baby over to you and ran off. Sara, what ever happened to this baby took place before she came into our house. But we can't be sure. Maybe something really came up and that's why she isn't back yet. Why hasn't she called the dad? Did you take her number? She was so agitated and in a rush. I think Motamedi has it. Hello?... Hi. The Internet got disconnected. Hello... can you hear me? hello... Shahin. Ok. At the airport. Yes I know, I'll take the redline. She isn't a nanny at all. Shahin hang on a second. What do you mean? Motamedi said she asked her to come and take care of her niece. But she said that this wasn't her real job. Shahin, I'll call you back. Ok. - Did you get her phone number? - She said she will bring it up. - Did you tell her you were in a hurry? - I'll go get it if she doesn't bring it. - Are you ok? - Yes. Sara, did you call the father from our home phone? Yes. Is this his number? I don't know... I can't remember. Let's not answer unfamiliar numbers for a bit. Ok. You look pale, Sara. It's nothing. She said she hadn't seen her baby for two weeks. What'll happen if she finds out that her daughter is dead? Amir, why did this happen? It's the pawnbroker. What should we do? We have to let him in. If I don't he'll stay at the door all day. What if the father comes back? You go inside. Go in the room and shut the door. Sara, wait. Not that unit, go and place some upstairs, good job... hurry back. Hi, I am really sorry, I'm a man of my word. I was on my way over a few days ago, when my phone rang. They said my mom was ill, so we took her to the hospital. - I'm sorry to stand you up, how are you? - Come in, please. Keep your shoes on, don't take them off. Hello, Hello. - Sorry, come in boy. - I'm coming... So, you're on your way. Open this door. What a strange world. I hope you're healthy where ever you go. Everything will be fine as long as you're healthy. Hamid get me that list. Here you go. Ok... so let's see what's what. You guys take the fridge and the stove, hurry. You've really put me to shame... I swear if I could, I would've taken care of everything myself. Take it. Microwave. The base is broken. Pick it up boy. He's standing there watching me. Hurry up. I have a cousin who's been living in Malaysia for several years now. I think I mentioned him before. This table is not in the list It belongs to someone... To who? Whatever. I think I mentioned it before. I can give you his number if you want, so that you can be in touch. you know, it's nice to have familiar people around in foreign lands. You can call each other and chat. Tell me, Malaysia is close to where you're going, right? Yes. Good. He's asked me to pack up my stuff and move there several times. But I am stuck here, how can I go? I have to see what I have, what I can do. Who knows, I may even go. Koroush... yes? - Hello ma'am. - Hi. Amir. - Sara! - She left. Put that on the top! hurry up, it's getting late. Toaster oven. My cousin makes good money there... But I don't know what's wrong with him, he keeps talking about coming back. I tell him what the heck for? Is there anything in this room? Sir... in this room. No that room is empty, leave it alone. Just take the things out here. Good. Ok, so they took everything. These are your own bags? You just left like that? If the father sees you we'll be in big trouble. I saw Motamedi leaving, so I went... - You should've called me... - I did... I wanted to tell you. Amir, let it go, I got the number, call her. It's disconnected. Is there anything else downstairs? No. It's mom. It's disconnected. I'll call her from inside the room. What did you do? What happened to your hand? Nothing... I fell down. Do you want this sir? - What? - Oh... smells good in here. - The LNB and stuff. - No, you can take it. - Hi. - Where is mom? She's coming. You promised not to argue with her, you promised. What is this? How should I know, ask her. Look how empty it is here, where is Sara? She had a headache and is lying down. Ok. auntie Manijeh is coming to the airport too. - Where is the double bed? - Cross off the bed. But I've sold these all together! Tell me what your loss is and I'll pay it. But that's not how it works if I was going to buy this way I would've charged differently. You're damaging my reputation here. The phone's ringing. Should I take the charger too? - Is that all? - Yes. Mom, I say one thing and you say something else. Amirali! - Listen a second. - Get me a glass of water. - Hello ma'am. - Hello sir. - Hi mom. - Hi. You climbed up all these stairs with your bad leg? I've brought you a few packs of dried herbs and cumin, you can't find these things there. Sir, we're all done here, do you need anything else? Thanks very much... thanks. Boy, come here and take these. - Hey... hang on. - That's very kind of you. - Here... - Please... Say thank you. Where are you going? - To see if Sara is up. - Don't. Come back here. Come here, let her rest. Didn't I say she has a headache and is sleeping? There is a jar of pickles too, be careful it doesn't break. Tell Sara to pack them between your clothes. Ok. Go downstairs for a bit, I want to talk privately with mom. I won't bother you. Go wait in the car, I'll be right down... Take the pots from the kitchen too. You can go wherever you want but what do you want with her? Mother... Mom, I don't even understand what you're saying? I can't figure it out. You and your wife think you know everything, you do what ever you want. But she is still a child. You've filled her head up with these things. And now she's gone and signed up for English lessons. Do you think that only people who want to move abroad study English? So what's wrong with that she'll learn a second language. No, there is nothing wrong with that she can go wherever she wants. English classes... wherever you can all leave. Forget all about me and my situation. I can take care of myself. You are the only thing I have. My only happiness was to come and see you once or twice a month. But I don't even need that. Go. Go and stay wherever you're more comfortable. Mom... we've gone over this before. We're not going away forever, are we? Mom, has there ever been a time when I haven't told you about what's happening in my life? I've confided in you every time I've kept you involved. Even now, if anything happens, you're the one I will come to. Amirali has something happened? No... just know that... Your presence is a comfort to me. I'm going now, that child is waiting in the car. Don't forget these either. Oh, I almost forget, hold this. I knitted these hats for you and Sara. Thanks very much. Nazanin said that it's cold there, this time of the year. Amirali, what's wrong? Why do you look like this? If I've said anything, it's because I'm your mother. Hopefully you'll have a child soon... And you'll understand how difficult it is to separate from him. Just leave, and may God watch over you. Mom, do you really want to come to the airport? Of course! Your uncles will all be there. Did you see what that idiot did to the new car? Forget it. The insurance will pay for a new door. - Goodbye for now. - Bye. It's disconnected. Let's call the police. We'll tell them the whole story. Shouldn't we call the dad first? We'll let the police call him. What are you going to tell the police? The fact that she ran away is the best evidence, No? The police will come and inspect everything and discover. The cause of death, the time of death, and everything will become clear. Who is it? - Hello. - Hi. - I'm sorry to disturb you. - No. I left Tina, your neighbor's daughter... Yes. Is your wife home now? No... you said you'd be back in an hour. I'm really sorry, I went to pick up some medicine, and got held up for a while. Then something else came up, and I dropped my cellphone too. It broke and I couldn't call her dad or anyone else to come pick her up. She's taken the baby with her. I've put you in trouble, was the baby ok? Yes... how come? It's just that I was out of touch since this morning and I was a bit worried. She's ok, and she slept most of the day... Very well, I'll be here when she gets back. - You can leave if you want. - Excuse me? You can go, because I'm not sure when my wife will be back. And she's already called Tina's dad. What did he say? I'm not sure, but my wife called and spoke with him. No, I'll stay, please let me know when they're back and I'll come take her. Ok. No problem. Did you hear what she said? She said, she'd gone to buy some medicine. Amir, what are you saying? She asked about the baby, what does that mean? It means nothing. What happened to this baby happened right here in this house. It means she's come to pick her up, it means she hasn't done anything, that's what it means. I don't understand, why are we dragging it out? I told you right then, call them, call her father and tell him everything. Tell him what's happened. Call and explain everything. Amir, call right now and tell them, right now. Call and let them know. Can't you? I will if you can't. I can do it. What are you saying? Do you even understand what you're saying. Do you know what it means if this happened to the baby here? That's all I'm saying, what next? Amir, we know we haven't done anything? Sara, I told her dad... stop yelling, why are you yelling? I told her dad that my wife has taken the baby out for a stroll. This means, that the baby was ok here. Oh God. Sara stop it... how can I... Oh God, Amir, this is what I'm trying to say. Why do you keep making stuff up? Why did you say your wife took the baby out? If you'd told the truth from the start we wouldn't be in this situation. No... No, if you hadn't accepted responsibility... For her we wouldn't be here now. What do you mean? Exactly what I said, stop yelling... if you want to talk, I'm right here, But if you want to yell and scream go and do it on the street. Who took this baby from its nanny? Who accepted this responsibility a few hours before our... Be quiet I am speaking... Accepted the responsibility before our departure? Did you even know these people, You took their baby? Do you know them? When I took the baby this morning, I thought it was asleep. She was sleeping. - Amir... - Sara... Amir, listen to me. How should I have known that the baby was dead? Tell me, how would you have known that she was dead if you had taken her? You shouldn't have taken her, you shouldn't have taken the baby Sara. Let me see your hand. It's nothing. What is it? It's Shima. She's forgotten our buzzer again. She was going to bring my necklace. Tell her we're not home. Tell her we're out. Tell her to leave it with the superintendent. I think she saw me on the balcony. She's calling me now. Go wash your face, don't let her see you this way. Hi, Shima, where are you? No. 9 Hi, put your name on the buzzer so I don't ring the neighbor every time. - Where's Sara? - In the bathroom, Hi honey. - Hi. - Hi, how are you? Are you ok? Let me wash my hands. What happened to your face? Nothing, the sign said "Park here and you'll get a flat" I parked and got a flat, I had to change my tire. I only left it for 5 minutes, came back and saw that I had a flat. Come in. So, you're finally leaving. Why don't you answer your phone? I didn't notice it. Why Australia of all places? Why are your eyes red? It's nothing. All the way on the other side of the world! Shima did you pay our exit fees? - Yes, here you are. - Thanks so much. - And here's your necklace. - Thank you. And that's a frame, I liked it and bought it as a going away gift. - Thanks so much. - It's nothing. Did the pawnbroker finally take away the stuff? So Melbourne was picked as the best city in the world. You're so lucky. Sara what's wrong? What's wrong? Sara... Let me look at you. Sara honey! Sara, I already apologized. I said that I was wrong dear. Amir what's happened? What have you done to her? What've I done? I beat her. What do you mean? Why is she crying? It's nothing, we had an argument and it's over now. Sara honey! I'm really sorry for you. Aren't you two ashamed of yourselves. Bring us a glass of water. What happened to your hand? Did he really beat you? I fell. You're about to go on a trip and you end up fighting? Armin! Come over here honey. It's natural, moving isn't easy, even for 6 months. With all your family here. Go to your mommy sweetheart. I sometimes think that if I was going to go somewhere for even 3 weeks I'd lose my mind. But it will end. You'll go for a couple of years and it'll be over. What baby? They don't have a baby honey. Why are you misbehaving so much? What's wrong with you today? You guys have made a decision, Stop thinking about it so much. Honey, they don't have a baby. Plus, you're not going to stay there for the rest of your lives. Stop it sweetheart, stop. You'll go for a while and come back. Why are you misbehaving so much? They don't have a baby love. What's wrong with you today? Sara, let me go and see what he wants. Let's go, Very well. Let's go find the baby. Armin... honey... Let's go... Sara let me go and see what he wants. Let's go sweetheart, Let's see where the baby is, come on. Here's the baby. There you go sweetheart. Didn't you want a baby? Here it is. Here's the baby. Go to your mommy now. Why are you so mad? I'm not mad. We have a lot to do. Now I see why you've made her cry. No, Amir is right. We have a lot to do and are both edgy now. Come here honey. - Shima take him. - Amir! Give it to me, Give it back if you don't want it. - Sorry... we bothered you. - It's ok, No. I'll leave you two to your work. Thanks for coming, thanks. No problem. So I'll see you at the airport. Yes, sure. Armin honey, let's go. Shima, thanks for the exit fees. - Bye. - Bye. - Say hi to Mani. - Ok. I'm sorry I couldn't control myself. Drink. You're right, I shouldn't have taken the baby. Forget it Sara. Amir, let's call the police. Everything is different now, call them and say what? I don't know, tell them everything that's happened. Sara. Let's say I call the police. Police come and tell us that we know you. You shouldn't have taken responsibility for the baby. We have to figure out what's happened ourselves. I said that I made a mistake. Sara that's not what I'm saying, just let it go. Hi, excuse me. They're not back yet, are they? No. Can you please call them and see when they'll be back? Tina's dad is in a bit of trouble. I have to go post bail. I want to know if it's ok if Tina stays here till I get back. Yes, it's ok, No problem. Thanks. She gets a rash, please give these to your wife. I'm really sorry. It's ok. You'll be back soon, right? Yes, I'll be back soon. Bye. Sara! Look at her hand. So? She moved. What happened to her? It's Shams! Open it. He's come to inspect the apartment. Open it Sara. Open the suitcase. Come on! What are you doing? Open the suitcase. Sara! Sara! Let me... Sara what are you doing? Amir! I said let it go! Amir! I have 6 children myself and am proud of them all. Last week was my youngest son's wedding. The thread on these fittings is gone. I'll change them. Is it a boy or a girl? A girl. These are the receipts for the service charge. The super has the one for this month. - Ok, thanks. - You're welcome. Can I see the bedrooms? Yes, please. This panel's broken? Yes, we were moving the furniture, Something hit the glass and it broke. Ok. You're not taking the bed? No, the bed's staying. See if the next tenant can use it... I was telling my wife last night that... We've never had tenants as good as you. Hello. Hello. Hello. That baby's a heavy sleeper! She didn't wake up. Amir! Can I look in there? Yes, go ahead. I want to sell the apartment. Last year you said you'd take it if I were to sell. That made me happy, who better than you. But now you're going away. I hope that you're well where ever you go. Hello. Yes, no... Ok, it's ok if Amin's there. I told you I'm going to inspect the apartment. Ok, I will get it on my way back. Don't worry. Bye. [The death of a newborn in sleep] Ok, so we're done here. Mr. Nejati, is there anything else? - Thank you so much. - You're welcome. I hope that everything goes well for you. Thank you. And here are the keys. - Thanks. - You're welcome. - Goodbye. - Bye. [The silent death of newborns: "SIDS" is the unexpected sudden death of a child under age 1] [That usually takes place while the baby is sleeping.] [This syndrome is sometimes called Crib Death.] [Pay attention to how your baby sleeps.] [Sleeping on the stomach increases the risk of SIDS] Hello. Hi mom. [Don't put your baby to sleep on its belly!] No, it's disconnected. Our phone's disconnected. I know, I saw your missed calls. No, I'm ok, just tired. [Don't let anyone smoke near your newborn.] Yes, yes, I have a cold. How about you? Yes I know. No, No, No. I swear, I really can't talk now. I know, I know, I'll call. I'll call once we leave, we're about to leave now. Ok, I'll call and we'll talk. Say hi to everyone. Ok, love you, bye. Sara, get up and clear this stuff. What do you mean? Get ready, we should leave. Go where? Sara, where were we going? Nothing's to our advantage here. This baby was alive when it came here. Yes, but we haven't done anything. It's not as simple as you think. Things will clear up somehow. It's already clear, Sara. This baby won't come back to life if we stay here. Why should we run away? We're not running away, Sara. We're going ahead with our plans from this morning, here. Hadn't we packed everything to go away? Amir, what happened to you all of a sudden? Nothing! I just want everything to be over with. That's all. Pretend that none of it has happened. I don't understand why we need to be in such great trouble... ... Just for doing a favor for someone else. I'm not coming. Sara, listen to me, pick up those things. Amir, I thought... I turned her over, I thought... Sara, you didn't know. Amir, I lay her on her stomach. I thought she wouldn't roll that way. Yes. I know. - I didn't know. - That's right, you didn't. - I didn't. - Yes. - I didn't know, right? - That's what I'm saying. It doesn't say it's a definite cause. It's just a possibility. There, you read it yourself. Look Sara, here, see. It doesn't say it's for sure. It says that it increases the risk... Sara look here, see... It says there are other possible causes. Narcotics, cigarette smoke. My smoking may have even caused it? - Amir! - Yes darling? Amir dear, let's go, let's go Amir. Please let's get out of here. Ok, Sara, Ok. - Amir, let's go. - Very well. Tell me something. Say something to me. Sara it will be ok. I'll make it ok. - Hello. - Here you go. - Thanks. - Enjoy. - Goodbye. - Bye. Yes? We'll be right there. - Hello Mrs. Karimi. - Hello dear. Thank you. Mrs. Karimi, this is Mr. Mosayebi's daughter... They left her with us this morning, They were supposed to pick her up but they're late. Can I leave her with you so he can pick her up from here? Yes, that's fine. Lay her down over there. Put her there. Don't worry. I'll take care of her. Sorry, Mrs. Karimi. God be with you. Mrs. Karimi, I'm sorry. It's ok.
