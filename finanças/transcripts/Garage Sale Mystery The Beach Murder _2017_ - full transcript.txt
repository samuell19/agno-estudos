Locals only, bud. No one owns the ocean. True, that. Nice car, man! Oh, man... would you look at that. Those little punks, huh? Here, let me help you clean this. Don't. Look, I'm just trying to help you out here-- you touch the car, and it's on. All right, I'm sorry. Hey, you, um, you should probably know that this... that this spot here, it's... it's dangerous. The rocks are right under the surface. Hell, you might end up getting hurt, huh? Thanks for the advice. You should take it. They're beautiful, aren't they? They're a lot like ones we have. Supposed to be one of a kind. They were a wedding gift, years ago. These are ours. My wife must have brought them in. What is she doing? I don't know. She wants a divorce. These were a wedding gift. That's the only thing that makes sense. I guess they're yours now. Well, someone has put a deposit down, so, technically, the new buyer owns them. Fine. Two can play this. But do me a favor, call whoever bought them. These have sentimental value to me. I want them back. Of course. Thank you. It's not just e-sports, it's professional e-sports. You get paid for playing video games? Yeah. Yeah, they're live-streaming the entire championship this year... dude... she totally smiled at you. Don't even think about it. She's, like-- out of our league. Dream on. I heard she's going to be an actress. She's drama club. You? You're computer club. Swans fly with swans. Ducks fly with ducks, right? These funeral fans are fabulous. 1930's? 1920's, complete collection from a Kansas funeral home. $100 for the whole set. Oh... this one's a little frayed, and it's torn there... you're asking 40 for this? That's pretty optimistic. What do you want to pay? Less. 30. I can't give you more than 20. You are tough. Fine. - 20. - Done. Remind me, when was the last time somebody came in looking for a surfboard? Oh, this isn't going to the store. Anne Winters' husband, Steve, collects these old surfboards. Would he want one like that? It looks pretty beat up. Hannah and I were watching "gidget" the other night, and moondoggie had a surfboard just like this one. I already texted Anne a picture, and she offered $100. And you paid...? 20. Nice work, partner. Now... how am I going to get this in the car? Okay, watch your step. Where would you like this? On the table is perfect. What happened to Steve's car? I'll let Steve explain. He was out surfing this morning. Ooh, surfing? A little cold for that, isn't it? Wetsuits. They go out year 'round. It's crazy. I'll let him know the board's here. Wow, wow, wow! Do you know what this is? It looked like the one in "gidget." Same maker. This is an original velzy. Too cool. Thank you, Jenn. Well, it had your name written all over it. Hey, what happened to your car? Young punk surfers, they don't know any better. They get territorial over their favorite spots. I don't want you going out there again. They're just lucky I didn't catch them. Well, I'm glad you didn't. Hey... are you and Jason doing anything Saturday night? No. ...and it fulfills my science requirement. It sounds interesting. Mm-hmm. Volcanoes, too? Oh, yeah. All natural disasters. We just studied Krakatoa. Volcanoes are cool. Actually, they're hot. Or not. Dormant is cool. Only at the surface. Logan, are you doing a project for computer club this year? Actually, um, I was thinking about going out for my school play, so... that'll be kind of fun. What's the play? It's, uh, "Romeo and Juliet." I haven't read it before, but I heard Shakespeare is pretty good, generally. Why would Logan be trying out for the school play? And Shakespeare? I'm not sure. I found out it's a contemporary version, so there's that. Huh, maybe he inherited my acting skills. When were you an actor? Grade six. Cinderella. I was "Prince Charming". Oh, of course you were. I still remember my lines. You want to hear them? "The shoe fits! The shoe fits! "We shall be married, and you will be my Queen." Oh, sounds like something you once told me. And it worked. Well, "Prince Charming", I have some shelves that need to go up at the store. Oh, and we have dinner plans on Saturday. As you wish. Long live the Queen. So, who legally owns them? You do. You bought them from the owner. Doesn't the husband own them, too? He is. She is. They both are. You know, either can legally sell them. The husband wants to buy them back. He says they have sentimental value. Sounds like he doesn't want to get a divorce. Whatcha doing? I can't make any sense of this Shakespeare stuff, it's like french or something. I thought you were doing a modern language version. No, we haven't got our copies yet. I went online and looked at this old film, and... the sword fighting was cool. The rest was pretty sappy. So, why the sudden interest in drama? I don't know, uh... I just thought it would look good on my college application, you know? You are such a little liar. Who is she? I don't know what you mean. We can talk when you're ready. Hey, sweetie, which ones? Oh, it's casual, you can wear your jeans. Love it. So, how do you know these people? Anne comes in the store a lot. She loves antiques. And what does he do, some kind of software thing? Yes, he's pretty successful. He does apps and stuff. They do e-coup, do you know it? You walk by the store, and it sends you a coupon to your phone? Mm, that's right, but the coupon is only good for one hour, so you shop even though you didn't plan on it. That's just what I need. You look nice. - You look lovely. - Thank you. ...we do conversions and new construction-- they just finished a 10-storey building downtown. It's beautiful. The one on Howard Street, with the red marble? That's it. I've been inside, it's amazing. The atrium has a garden wall two stories high. What's the design trend for inside office space? Open concept. Perimeter offices are horse and buggy. I assume you guys are pretty modern? Yeah. It's more collaborative. We even have surf breaks. Really? Not officially, but most people like to surf in our office. So, when the surf's up, the office is empty. Well, sort of. You know we all work from home later, and as long as everyone is meeting their targets, it's cool. You don't surf, Mitch? No, too cold. He's a mountain biker. Can't really complain about me being away from the office. Fair enough. Steve, did you ever get your car fixed? Oh, it was just a couple of scratches. And spray paint. These kids are little thugs. They trashed your car over a wave? That's why I have insurance. Oh, hey, uh... this is my brother, Todd. Hi, everybody, sorry, I'm sorry for the interruption. Todd, please, come in, we have plenty. Have a seat. Oh, no, I've already eaten, thank you. I just need to grab my little brother just for a second. Again, I'm so sorry. I should come, too. Oh, no. No, it's fine. I'll be right back. Todd was with the company. We had to let him go about a month ago. Steve had a hard time with it. How do you fire your big brother? Ooh, that had to be tough. Who's hungry? Let's have dinner. Come on, it's ready. Yeah, it smells so good. We're so glad you guys came over. We had a really nice time. Thanks again for the surfboard. Oh, you're welcome. Hey, Jason, we should get you to come by and take a look at our building. We're growing fast, we're going to need more room. I'd be happy to. Well, thanks again. Good night. Thanks, honey. Good night, guys. See you. That was fun. Yeah. That was kind of fun. Yeah, Anne is great. Steve seems really nice. Mm. His brother Todd's a little odd. - Yeah. - Nice house. They have a maid. Maybe I should invent an app. - Maybe you should. - I might. A nap app. Schedule my naps... we would make millions! Oh you're so funny, honey. Good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Goodbye. - Bye. I'm out, too. Bye, honey. Have a good day. You too. See you, bud. Later. Hey, um, so, mom, you used to be in school plays, right? I was, indeed. So, you wouldn't mind helping me with my "Romeo and Juliet" audition, would you? No, I wouldn't mind at all, but I think you have a better option. What's that? Your sister. Are you serious? Yeah, she wrote a Shakespeare term paper last semester. Okay, yeah, that'll work. You know, this could totally be an epic fail. Oh, honey, you'll be fine. You know, your father was in a play. Dad was? Really? Ask him sometime. He still remembers his lines. Oh! Hi! Good morning, Jenn. Hi, Steve. Oh, Dani, this is Steve, Anne's husband. Hi. Hi. So, look, I meant to ask you, what's your favorite charity? Why? Anne said the store supports a charity with a fundraiser, but she wasn't sure which one. Children's Hospital. We run an annual garage sale for them. Ah, perfect. That surfboard is worth more than I paid. Anne said you probably wouldn't accept any more money, so why don't you take this... and use it to jump start the fundraiser. Oh, my goodness, $3,000. What? Steve, is the surfboard worth that much? It's very collectible. Look, I've got to run. Nice to meet you, and great to see you and Jason the other night. Well, uh, thank you. Oh... Nice. Very nice. I will never question one of your garage sale purchases again. Thank you. Actually, I take that back. What is this? Folk art. Hi. Oh... I want to thank you for getting my candlesticks back. You're very welcome. Now, I have some stuff I want to sell. Autographed helmet, pennant, and official team jersey. You must be a Cowboys fan. Oh, no, I'm a Packers fan. Well, who's the cowboys fan? My wife. Will you excuse me for one moment? Sure. I don't think he really wants a divorce. I mean, the candlesticks were a wedding gift. So, why is he bringing in her cowboys stuff? He's hurt, angry. And you're getting involved in this why? I think they might make up, and want all their stuff back. Okay, so we don't actually sell any of this stuff. Here's what we do... Okay... we'll take that stuff on consignment. Fine. Just so it's out of the house. Thanks. Excuse me, um... if you don't mind me asking, is there any chance you'll stay together? Not likely. I married 'Miss Right'. I just didn't know her first name was "always". It must be love. No, it's not. Whoa, why else would you try out for the school play? Look, I just thought it would be fun. No, Regan smiled at you, and you thought you'd impress her. No way. Way. I know a girl in drama club, she tells me that Regan has already been cast as Juliet. I gotta go. I guess you'll be auditioning with her. I don't think I could even talk to her, let alone act in a play. So, I gotta hand it to you, dude. Thanks, man. Not that you stand a chance with her, but still, I admire the effort. See ya. Hey, hon', come take a look. Steve mentioned his company might be doubling in size, so I, uh, roughed this up for him. It's beautiful. Thanks. Now, is that an entirely new building? No, no, no, just modifying the one they have now. Wow. You know, Steve came in the shop today, and he made a big donation to the children's hospital fundraiser. How big? Apparently, that surfboard was worth a lot of money. $3,000. For an old surfboard? It's collectible. Wait, how much did you... sell it for? One... hundred dollars. A hundred bucks? What happened to juicing? It was too much waste. Skins and pulp... no, now we're souping. It's more fiber, and without the sugar spike that you get from juice. Everything just all mushed together? Right. Without any of the goodness strained out. Oh... Hey, Anne. Oh, no... oh, Anne, I'm so sorry. Yes, of course, I can. Oh... it's Steve. They think he drowned. A car registered to Steve was the only one around. He was discovered by somebody walking their dog. Did he often go surfing by himself in isolated areas? Uh... yes. He loved that. I'm so very sorry, I just need your identification. Yes... that's my husband. ...and somebody's got to get the land rover. It'll get towed to impound if they don't. When will they release the body? If it is ruled an accidental drowning, it could be as early as the day after tomorrow. Anne's got to contact the funeral home, make arrangements. I'll talk to her. Okay. Bye. How does he drown? He was a competitive swimmer, a lifeguard. He saved people, he doesn't drown. I-I just don't get it. Anne... I know this is difficult, but you have to make arrangements with a mortuary. Is there someone in your family who could help you with that? My dad, I guess. And the Land Rover needs to be picked up. I want to see where he drowned. Jenn, will you take me? Wait... his body was found 50 yards north of the car. Is this my fault? Anne, don't say that. I asked him not to go back to the other beach. Maybe he didn't know this place, you know, maybe there was a rock. This is not your fault. Okay... let's get the car and get out of here. Do you want to put your stuff in the car? What are you thinking? I'm just wondering why the body was found way back there, but the car is up here. I mean, this is where he must have entered the water. I don't know. Currents? This carpet is wet. Maybe he surfed someplace first, and put his wetsuit in the back. I want to head back. Anne, are you going to be okay? Would you like me to come over? My folks and some friends are on their way. I need to call Todd. I'll be fine. It hasn't really hit. Thanks. Okay-- actually, I feel kinda weird driving his car. Could you drive it and I'll take yours? Of course. Here you go. Thank you. You're welcome. So, was Steve by himself? As far as anyone knows. The first thing Anne said when she heard the news was, "I don't believe it." That's a natural reaction, don't you think? His car was vandalized by surfers, and he had confrontations in the past. You know I love your mind. You're able to figure out where a missing sock went, and why there are blood stains on a 30-year-old wedding dress. Oh, gosh, you remember that? I do. And some others. But this one? Surfing is a high-risk sport. People drown all the time. I know. I know, just, when Anne was immediately suspicious, it started me thinking. Hey, um, so I talked to Hannah, and she said she's going to help with the audition. Great. You know, I did theater back in the day. I heard. Prince Charming, right? That's right. So, if you want some input, some help-- I think I'll just, uh, start with Hannah, but, uh, thanks. "The shoe fits! The shoe fits..." Oh, that's not bad. You're both mocking me. Hi. I've got some sports memorabilia I'd like to get rid of. Let me guess, Packers? How did you know? Just a hunch. Oh. I'd just like to get it out of the house. I'm Jennifer. I remember you brought some things in before, some lovely candlesticks. That's right. I... don't see them. I found a buyer. They were pretty unique. If you don't mind me asking, do you remember where you got them? They were a present. A-a wedding present. Oh. Well, 'm sorry to hear that. Long story. Not over yet. You're still married? You could say that. I have an authentic helmet, a football signed by the team when they won the championship. Are you interested? Yes. We would be happy to take them on consignment. Fine. I've got some other stuff I'd like to bring in as well. Some silver, some artwork. Sure. And again, I'm sorry about the marriage. Me too. I thought I married 'Mr. Right'. Is his first name "Always?" It's "Never." This isn't going to be pretty. Don't forget, "no good deed goes unpunished." I don't think either one of them wants to get divorced. Did you see her face when I brought up the candlesticks? Don't say I didn't tell ya. Yeah. I'm gonna go check on Anne. I'll be back later. Give her my best. I can't get it out of my head. Drowning doesn't make any sense. I don't think he drowned. He couldn't have. What do you think happened? I think he was murdered. It wasn't an accident. Murdered? But how? Say he gets into a fight, someone hits him, and knocks him out, and he drowns, or someone holds him underwater. You think someone would murder Steve over surfing? You saw what they did to his car. Steve seemed like a guy who could take care of himself. That's the problem. He wouldn't back down. But there's another possibility. I want to show you something. I don't think it's true. I don't want to believe it's true. Todd was the best man at our wedding. Growing up, they were inseparable. Mitch said they had to fire Todd. Steve fired him. They did everything they could for him, but Steve was Todd's boss. His little brother was his boss. Did something, specifically, happen? He came into work when he felt like it, he drank. There were harassment complaints from the girls. It got pretty ugly the day he was fired. Well, it's a long way from getting fired to murdering your brother. I know, but the other night, when Todd dropped in? He was drunk. They came back here, and Todd begged for his job back. Todd threatened him. Did he say he would kill him? Not in those words. He said he would "get him for this". Have you talked to Todd? No. I've called a couple times, but he's not picking up. Looking for anything special? Yeah, cool clothing for the school play. What's the show? Romeo and Juliet, set in the 1950's. Sounds fun. Are you doing wardrobe? Oh, she's Juliet. I'm doing wardrobe. We're looking for one of those poodle skirts. We don't have one. You might check 'Vintage Threads', just down the street. Cool, thanks. Love your store. Huh. What? So we've been wondering why Logan is going out for 'Romeo and Juliet'. Yeah, and? That was Juliet. Oh, my. Logan... Hmm-hmm. Dr. Tramell. Hello, Jennifer. You must be here to talk about the surfer. Which reminds me... how do surfers say hello to each other? I give. They wave. Do you ever worry that these jokes might be a little inappropriate, given where we are? Well, you ever hear the expression "whistling past the graveyard"? Can you imagine my job without humor? Point taken. I feel for each and every one of my clients, and when I die, I want to go peacefully just like my grandfather did, in his sleep, not screaming, like the passengers in his car. Oh, Dr. Tramell, that's horrible. Your surfer is a simple drowning, Jennifer. His wife has a hard time believing that he drowned. Maybe there was a fight, and someone knocked him unconscious, or perhaps held him underwater. Well, then you would have a murder. But? But there's no bruising on the head from a blow or a rock, there's no trauma to the neck and shoulders, which would be evident if somebody held him under the water. I am looking at an accidental drowning, plain and simple. First step is to know what the play is about. Do you believe in love at first sight? Yeah. I think so. Romeo and Juliet fall in love at first sight. It's ecstatic, intense. They must be together even if their families hate each other. You know, Romeo kinda seems like a stalker. Climbing over her wall to look in her room. Ooh, boy... and you're doing the balcony scene. Yup. Why don't we just read through it and see how it goes? Okay, um... this is the modern English version, so... you start. "Who are you, coming at night, unseen, to ask me questions?" "I can't tell you my name. I hate my name because you hate it. "I have only heard a few words from you, "but I know the sound. "You're Romeo, and a Montague." "If you don't like either, then I'm not..." I'm pretty bad, aren't I? It's going to take some work. Sit down. Mitch. Hey, Jenn, have you got a moment? Can I buy you a cup of coffee? Sure. Everyone at work's a wreck. Anne seems to be... she's called me twice. I understand her grief, but I don't know why she thinks murder's involved. I don't know either. But Anne thought Steve was invincible, especially in the water. The ocean is the ocean. It doesn't matter how good of a swimmer you are, and I don't buy angry surfers protecting their turf. She has another theory. Yeah, I know. Todd. But how? He went surfing with Steve and held him under the water? Anne said that Todd threatened Steve. He threatened me, too. Steve wouldn't give him his job back. He couldn't, even if he wanted to. I would have to agree. So Todd had just as much reason to kill me as he did Steve. Except you weren't his brother. You're awful quiet today. How was work? Fine. You sell anything? Not really, I was out of the store most of the day. Where'd you go? Oh, here and there. Um, stopped by the morgue. I'm not going to say anything. Coroner Tramell thinks it was an accidental drowning. Good. I mean, not good, but better than murder. So, why did you make the return trip to the morgue? I'm trying to help Anne. She just can't accept it. Hey... so, Logan and I rehearsed today. Oh, how'd it go? Let's just say Logan is really talented... with computers. I still can't figure why he's going out for the play in the first place. The girl playing Juliet came to the store. I have a feeling my little brother is smitten. She's gorgeous. Attaboy, Logan. Okay, honey, I'll see you later. Mom, Anne Winters. Oh, thanks. Hi, Anne. What? Yes, I'll come over right now. Someone broke into Anne's house last night. Did she call the police? Not yet. But she thinks it's Todd. I thought I turned the alarm on last night. This morning, it was off. Maybe I didn't, but... but then... I was looking for a piece of mail, and I noticed the chair. The chair wasn't like that. It was pushed in, I know it was. Who has the alarm code? No one, I don't think. Was anything taken? I can't tell. I know Steve has some stuff here from work. I don't know what's been taken, if anything. Frank. Let me guess. You think the guy that washed up on the beach wasn't a drowning victim. It's a murder. Hmm? The killer was hiding under the water with scuba gear, and then he grabbed his foot, and pulled him under the water. Hmm? Is that...? That is quite an imagination you have. Am I right? You came here to tell me that the drowning was a murder. Do you want to hear this or not? No-- Anne Winters is convinced this was not an accidental drowning. Has she called the D.A.'s office? No, not yet. Suspect? Motive? Well, there have been fights, vandalism to his car, and incidents in the past. And? And Steve has a brother, Todd, who was recently fired. He threatened Steve. Anne thinks Todd broke into their house last night, and Todd has not been seen since before Steve died. Hmm. What? Let's eat. So? So... I'll drive out, and talk to the surfers. If anyone files a missing persons for Todd or accuses him of a crime, I'll look into that, too. Great. It's probably nothing. Oh, it's... it's never nothing with you, Jenn. Oh, you're buying. Hi. More wedding presents? How'd you know? Most people don't want reminders. Would you? No. But you said you were still married. I am. Would you like some tea? What was he thinking, huh? He comes out here with a brand-new Land Rover. Look, the guy's got bucks to be surfing anywhere he wants. Why not Hawaii? Or here, if he wants. No, no, it... it's dangerous out here, okay? These outsiders, they come in here, they don't know the current, or the break. They don't know that there's hidden rocks out there. You guys, you're out here for what, some vandalism? This rich guy must have a lot of pull. This rich guy... is dead. He was found drowned on a beach about a half hour North of here. Well, there you go. Instant karma, huh? Lotta rocks up there, too. Look, I tried to warn him. Yeah. Let's see some I.D. What for? I didn't do anything. Well, this beach? It's owned by Pine Dale Forestry, so, technically, you're trespassing. So, let's see some I.D. So, Jesse... How'd you know the car was a Land Rover, hmm? I'm stuck between a thinker and brute force. I go on instinct. Well, mystic goes by wisdom, but valor goes by strength. Logan, this is important. You only get to choose once. He's bummed about his acting. Did you rehearse with your sister? Yeah, I did, and it was really, really lame. Well, did you try thinking about Regan while you were acting? No, I-I didn't. Look, can we just not talk about this right now, and get back to the game? I'm definitely going to go instinct. Cool. I'm going valor. Come on, let's go. Looks like all their wedding china and their silver. Kay and I talked. She said it's too many memories. They just bought a new house. It needs a do-over. Oh, no. She wants it feminine, he wants it more simple, so, a power struggle. Not good. It gets worse. She overheard him on the phone saying that they shouldn't have bought the house, and probably shouldn't have gotten married in the first place. Oh, that hurts. Yeah, there were tears. She still loves him. Has she figured out that he's trying to sell her stuff, too? Well, they're still moving in, lot of things still in boxes, but it won't take long. Not if they come in the store at the same time. You get my e-mail? No. I'll check now. All right. I've been talking to some surfers out where Winters got his car messed up. Not a friendly bunch. Who is this? Meet Jesse Fuller. Arrests include public intoxication, petty theft, and felony assault. Two years ago, he got in a fight with another surfer, put him in a coma. Almost died. What was the fight about? Same thing. Wasn't a local. And he didn't go to jail? No, there were other surfers around. All locals. No one saw a thing. Have you heard from Todd yet? No. I've called. No answer. No one's seen him either. I don't get it. I think it was Todd who broke into the house. Are you sure? And I think he went into Steve's office, but I... I don't know why. He may have come here looking for company secrets. When Todd was fired, his access to the company's system was revoked. Can you see if someone logged in last night? Oh, yeah. Huh. I thought I knew Steve's password, but it's not working. Try "stoked." That's what I tried. Can I send a tech out here tomorrow to have a look at this? Yeah, sure. Anne... do you really think this all points to murder? That Todd could do this? I don't know. Where is he? Why did he disappear the second Steve dies? Bye. Thank you for coming. Call me any time. And if you feel like it, we have a spare bedroom. Oh, I'll be okay. Thanks. I had the alarm people come out, the code's been changed. Okay. Drive safe. Thanks. Get some rest. I will. Hey. Hey, are you going to be okay here? Uh... I think so. Okay. Call me, all right? I will. Drive safe. Okay. Bye. All I can suggest is that you be sure your house is locked. Get some security lights for that garage. That's it? The guy had a knife. Patrol cars are looking for him on the street. Okay. Hey. They say I'm going to live. My pride's hurt more than anything. What happened? It was dark, the guy was wearing a mask, I fired off a couple shots, but he got away. Could it have been Todd? Is that possible? I don't know, it happened so fast. Did you get a sense of his height, his build? It could have been like Todd's, but I really don't know. I'm calling the D.A.'s office. This has to be connected to Steve's death. How did you have a gun? I have a permit to carry. Normally I leave it in the house, but lately I've been a bit more careful. Anne, if this was Todd-- and I'm not saying it was-- should you be concerned? I don't think so. If Todd broke into my house, he could have harmed me then. He didn't. The question is, what is he looking for? Does Mitch think this is about Todd trying to steal their business secrets? Maybe. It could also be about Todd getting revenge for getting kicked out of the business. But if Todd wanted to kill Mitch, why not just do it? The attacker had a knife. Why not hide in the dark and stab him? You've got a multi-million-dollar business, one partner drowns, his widow gets broken into, and the other partner is physically attacked. And the brother who was fired is missing. Seems pretty obvious. That's what bothers me. Oh, boy. Where is it? Oh, it's right around here, they just opened up. It's a spa? It's a "float spa." You float on water that is the exact temperature of your body, so you can't even feel it. It's completely dark, totally soundproof. Sounds a little scary. You float for an hour, completely deprived of all sensory input. That's just what I need. It is what you need. Come and float. Pass. Okay, gimme your coat. Oh, hey, Frank. Hey. I just got a call from the D.A. this morning because he got a call from Anne Winters. The press is gonna have a field day with this, rumor or not, and with this mugging last night, the story even gets juicier. How can I help? Keep the widow away from the press, okay? Now, I gotta go talk to this other partner, and track down the brother, Todd. Anne is wondering if Todd might be the one that mugged Mitch last night. Oh, I read the report. Is there any connection at all to the drowning suspect Jesse Fuller? No, he's got a solid alibi. No connection at all. And is the D.A. saying this is now a murder investigation? No. This is a "keep my job and make everyone happy" investigation. Yeah. I'll see ya. So, did you find any online acting lessons? I didn't look. I, uh, I don't think I'm really cut out to be a thespian. A what? A thespian. You know, like an actor. Wait, so you're not going out for "Romeo and Juliet"? Nope. I've got way better things to do. Hi, Logan. Oh, um, hi. What's up? I saw where you signed up for Romeo and Juliet. Yeah... Yeah, I-I did. That's cool. It'll be fun, and we need more guys in drama. Yeah... yeah, that'll be, uh... That'll be really fun. I gotta go. See ya, Logan. Uh, bye, Regan. I guess you're back in the audition? I'm here to see Mitch. Steve felt guilty about his brother. He was, frankly, a failure. It's crazy, we even created a job for him, made him a vice-president. Steve thought, given the opportunity, Todd might step up. It was a mistake. How much is the company worth? Well, it's a public company, so it's no secret. Given our current share price, about $200 million, more or less. How much was Todd making? About 200k a year. But there were incentives for vesting with stock options. Worth? At 36 months, about $2 million. He had a year left before vesting. And by getting fired, he... He got...? None of it. I want to show you something. This is security footage from his last day here. He had been drinking all morning. You can tell. Well, Mrs. Winters thinks he broke into the house and tried to get into Mr. Winters' study. That's the only thing that makes sense to me. There's intellectual property that a thief, if they were familiar with our business, would be able to sell to a competitor. Well, wouldn't you know if he tried to access the network? Oh, yeah, yeah, we'd know. And he didn't. I sent a tech out there to check it. Do you think it was a break-in? Nothing was stolen, the computer wasn't accessed. Why break into a house unless you take something? Hmm. Any idea where Todd might be? There are a few bars you might check. No one can reach him on his phone. He's got a couple of girlfriends, but... who knows where. Thank you for your time. Hey, how was it? Jenn... you have to float. I am so relaxed. It is better than a martini, better than a massage. Um, and I got this in the waiting room. Isn't that the company Steve Winters owned? "Following the death of co-founder Steve Winters, "Idea Dome may be a buyout candidate. "Winters is known "to have been opposed to any sale, but the door may now be open." Hey, Frank. Yes. I-I'm on my way. It looks like they've caught a break. That's nice. A guy broke into a pharmacy late last night. He was caught in the act. What does that have to do with Steve's death? Well, he's on probation, he's looking at some serious jail time. He wants to cut a deal. Says he has some valuable information about Steve Winters. You think he's for real? Well, you tell me. See if any of the details he provides lines up with what you already know. I gotta know, all charges dropped, right? I make no promises. Look, I'm just a surfer, I'm not really a criminal. And that's why you were caught at a pharmacy last night at 3:00 A.M.? If word gets out, I'm done. You're already done, but this is a chance to redeem yourself. Oh, man... Okay. We keep a few local spots to ourselves, right? Anybody who's not one of us surfs there, bad things happen. Like? They might come back to their car and find a window's been smashed, a tire slashed. What happened to Steven Winters? He ran across the wrong guy. And who was that? Jesse Fuller. When he snaps, he'll do anything. What happened? So... the first time Winters was warned, he came back to find that his Land Rover had been trashed. How was it trashed? Nothing major. Dirt, sticks, leaves... little spray paint. - Spray paint? - Yeah. "Locals only. Eat the rich." Then what happened? About a week or so later, Winters comes out again, really early, and it's not the same beach as before. Jesse's there, he sees Winters. He doesn't say a word, just paddles out, knocks the dude off his surfboard, and holds him under. He kills a man for surfing in the wrong spot? He didn't mean to kill him. He meant to half-drown him. You saw this? Yeah. Anyone else see it? No. What do you think? Everything fits, all the way down to the spray paint on the car. Sounds like murder. What do we got this time, littering, a parking ticket? Murder, Jesse. Hands behind your back. No, no, no, I didn't kill that dude. Okay, just, just... at least let me change my clothes, okay? It's right here in my car. Ah, I think I might have something down at the jail for you. Do you like orange? Oh, come on... Jenn, come on in. Anne, I wanted to tell you in person that a witness came forward, and... said they saw a surfer drown Steve. Are you okay? Yes. In a weird way, I'm... I'm relieved it's not Todd. He must be devastated. I'm so sorry I suspected him. Well... it still might have been Todd who broke into your house and I think I know why. I thought there was a picture here of Todd and Steve as kids. I think that what Todd was afer. He wanted that picture. I got to find him, talk to him. Anything we didn't expect? No. Jesse denies having anything to do with Winters' drowning. He admits the confrontation, but says he never saw him after that. Do you think Tucker is telling the truth? Do you? Well, he seems to have all the details right. He has every reason in the world to lie. I mean, if the D.A. accepts his deal, well, then he walks, but if he doesn't, well, he's going straight to jail. So, he's not a reliable witness. Not exactly. But trust me, I'm going to be interviewing every surfer up and down the coast, looking for corroboration. Any chance Jesse'll get bail? Possibly, not likely. I mean, here's a guy who almost beat a surfer to death last year. What about locating Todd? It's not a priority. He could be in Vegas for all we know. No, I got a hold of Anne, told her to call me if he shows up. Anyway, I've got some surfers to talk to. If Tucker knows anything about Steve's murder, he's not the only one. "What a to do to die today at a minute or two till 2:00." Hey, whatcha doing? It's an acting lesson I found online, and, uh, yeah, the first step is enunciation. Hmm. You can do anything online these days, can't you? I, uh, tried rehearsing with Hannah, mom, and, uh... I wasn't very good. Ah, well, it takes a lot of practice. I'm just worried that... you know, people are going to laugh. Then why are you doing it? I've been asking myself the same thing. Perhaps there's a girl you're trying to impress? How did you know? Mom instincts. Okay, um, her name is Regan, and she's playing Juliet, and I just, I thought it would be cool if I played Romeo, you know? You know, Logan, just being you might be enough. Any girl would be lucky to date you. Thanks. But you like this girl, right? Yeah. That's an understatement. And you'd like her to know it, but you're a computer guy, and she's a drama girl, and there's no way the two of you should be together. We live in, like, two separate worlds. Hmm... but you like her. If only there was a way you could tell her... Right. So, climb over her garden wall and tell her when no one's around. I get it. So, I'm like Romeo. Yes, use that as your motivation. I still might stink. Maybe. But "better to have loved and lost than never loved at all." I was thinking, better to have never stepped foot on stage than getting booed off. Well... there's that, too. I wondered what the light was doing on down here. Oh, I'm just thinking about some stuff. I thought they made an arrest. They did, but some things bother me. Wasn't there an eyewitness? Yup, his name is Tucker. He says that Jesse held Steve under the water, didn't mean to drown him, just wanted to scare him. So, what's the problem? It sounds like they have the guy. Well, a couple of things. Tucker is looking to beat a jail sentence. Hmm, so he could be lying. And the other thing is, Anne suspects Steve's brother, Todd. I mean, he had motive, and he hasn't been seen since before Steve's death. Sounds complicated. I'm going back to bed. You should, too. I will, in a bit. Good night. Good night, honey. This would go perfectly in our living room. The walls are going to be a very light peach. And what's the sofa? I'm going to recover it. I'm thinking a subtle floral pattern. More flowers? We've got flowers everywhere. See, Kay wants to live in a rest home, flowers and lavender perfume. And he wants to live in an auto repair shop. We got along great before buying this new house. Now everything's a fight. That's going in our living room. That's what I want in the living room. I don't like flowers. This has been one big mistake. A mistake... that's what he thinks. I'm sure he didn't mean it. I think he did. Maybe he's right. I know what you're saying. It's always bothered me, too. It just doesn't seem to add up. Would you mind walking me through the day that Steve died, everything that happened? Sure. Well, Steve was always up around 5:00 or 6:00. He loved that time of the morning. Steve would jump on the computer and check the surf. If the surf was up, he'd grab a board and get a session in before work. If it was flat, he would float and do his meditation. Float? Here? Take a look. Steve would float for an hour. He said he was meditating, but I think he was just grabbing some more sleep. He'd shower off and go to work. Dani's been doing this. They have a rental place downtown. Huh. Well, Steve, he loved it. He said he got some of his best work done in there. Why so many wetsuits? Weather. Winter would be a thick suit, and summer would be really thin. Oh, I can't imagine how they go out there in the cold. This one's pretty thick. That's definitely a winter suit. Surfers are passionate. If the swell is right, they're going out. The good news is the D.A. is filing murder charges against Jesse Fuller. They are going with Tucker's eyewitness statement. Personal effects of Steven Winters. Anything interesting from the surfers you talked to? No, they're like gang members, no one wants to be a snitch. Just got Winters' autopsy report. No surprises. Cause of death, drowning. No signs of trauma to the head, which rules out any submerged rocks or logs. No bruising around the neck or shoulders that would indicate being forced underwater... Wait a sec. Tucker said that Jesse forcibly held Winters underwater. Why no bruising? Feel this, Frank. It's very soft rubber. You might not bruise through it. Since when do you know about wetsuits? I was at Anne's today, I saw Steve's boards and wetsuits. Frank, this is really interesting. Steve wouldn't have worn this suit. This is a summer suit. It's cold now. He was wearing it. Maybe the thick one was too tight. Maybe the thin one was, you know, just right. Okay. I'm just saying. Jenn... I'm trying to build a solid case here, based on evidence, not wetsuit thickness. The D.A. is very happy that we have an arrest. Hmm? Kay! Thanks for coming down. You've got me curious. Well, we've got good news. We have a buyer for all your stuff. W-wow. That's good. Including everything your husband brought in. Oh. Right, I guess if I can bring things in, he can, too. Well, we're still pricing everything, but we do have some questions. We were wondering, could you come tomorrow after we close? 6:00, would that work? Sure. I could. Someone wants to buy it all? - Mm-hmm. - Yeah. It's a... top... ...interior designer. Yes, big, right? That's right. Very big. Loves everything. We just want to get you the best price. Yeah. Okay, then. I'll see you tomorrow. And the husband agreed? I talked to Thad this morning. He'll be here 6:10 tomorrow. Whatcha got there? Oh, Logan left his audition pages. Romeo and Juliet, in modern English, it's kind of interesting. Can I see? Sure. Go ahead. You start. Really? Yeah, go for it. Okay. "If they see you, they'll kill you." "I'm more worried about the look in your eyes "than 20 of your family with swords. Just look at me with love, and I'm invincible." "I would give anything for them not to see you." "Night will hide me... Shh! "...and if you love me, let them find me here." I have an idea. Okay. "Who told you how to find me?" "Love told me where you are. "I'm no sailor, "but if I were across the farthest ocean, I would set sail for you." "This is too quick. "So, my love, goodnight. Our love will blossom the next time we meet." "Are you going to leave me so unsatisfied?" Well... okay, Romeo, come here and give me a kiss. That is not in the play. No, it's not. They were pretty good, though. Mm-hmm. Okay, I can do this. How's the audition coming? You know there wasn't a kiss in the balcony scene, right? You saw that, huh? Yeah. You, uh, you guys were great. I'm glad we could help. Maybe you could help me with something. Okay. I know there are websites that surfers check for the waves, but can you check conditions in the past? Probably, yeah. What do you want know, the wave size, or...? Yes, uh, water temperature, anything to do with the currents. This is the date and location. Time frame would be between 5:00 and 8:00 in the morning. Okay, um... there you go. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Wow, yeah, they have everything. Um... water temp, 58 degrees, and the current was moving North to South. Hold on, so that means, if you were surfing, the current would move you South. Right, but I don't think anyone would be surfing, because there was a swell of, like, two feet. That's the waves? Or lack of. Like, I said, I don't think anyone would bother surfing that. Okay, can you check your e-mail? I sent you a photo, I'm hoping you can work your magic. Yeah, hold on. I'll try. What is it? Sand. Right there. Can we see that better? Yeah. Um... here, lower the contrast... voil?. Looks like a bike track. Wonder why it would just stop there. Maybe that's where it starts. Wow, looks great. I just hope our little plan doesn't blow up in our faces. Mm. Where are you going? I need to talk to Mitch. Why, I thought they made an arrest? They did, but there are a few things that don't fit. And then you get attacked at your house. What if the witness, Tucker, is lying? Wow, that's a curveball. Maybe Steve wasn't surfing alone. Maybe he was with Todd. I still can't see Todd being able to overcome Steve in the water. You thought Todd was looking for business secrets to sell to a competitor. I read some newspaper article that said your company was in talks about a buyout. Could Todd have reached out to them? Maybe. Makes sense. Are you selling the company? I wish that story never came out. Steve and I were both against selling the company, but now that he's gone, I don't know. Is there someone at Gigotech that you could discreetly talk to, see if Todd has been in contact with them? There could be, but even if they were thinking of buying some of our intellectual property, they wouldn't admit to it. It's illegal. The more I think about this, the stranger it gets. The currents were moving South that day, but Steve's body was found 50 yards North of his car. I don't think he drowned and washed up. So, how do you explain it? I think someone placed him there. Do you have any idea when she'll be back? Here she is right now. - Jenn. - Anne? With everything that's been going on, I missed this voice message from Todd. When? Day before yesterday. He sounds really messed up. He's drunk and crying. He drowned, it's not fair. If he died, I'm... he told me... he-he wrote it up. He wanted to protect you, but I c-couldn't find it... I looked, and I couldn't find it-- What's he talking about? He's out of his mind. I called Mitch, he couldn't make any sense out of it. He sounds really bad. He sounds like he's in trouble. I'm going out to his place. I'll watch the store. I'll drive. Frank, we're at Todd's. Okay, I'll see you when you get here. Frank is on his way. Do you want to wait until he gets here? No, I'm not afraid of Todd. Todd? Todd? It's Anne. Are you here? Doesn't look like anyone's cleaned up in a while. I don't like this. Todd? Todd! It's Anne. Medical Examiner thinks he's been dead for a couple days. At first glance, it appears he drank himself to death. Anne... even if you had picked the message up a couple of days ago, I don't think it would have made a difference. I don't know. What was he talking about? The pain he was in... did you understand anything he said? Play it again. He drowned, it's not fair. If he died, I'm... he told me... He-he wrote it up. He wanted to protect you, but I c-couldn't find it... I looked, and I couldn't find it-- Sounds like he was looking for something. He broke into your house, and he took the picture he was holding, so I don't think it was that. What then? Um... something to protect you. A will, did Steve have a will? In our safe deposit box. Not complicated, everything went to me, and my will gave everything to him. Well, if not a will, then what? Oh, hey, Logan. Hey. Break a leg. What's, uh... it means the opposite. It's a theater saying. Oh. Okay, uh, then... yeah, you, too, uh... break both of them. I think one will do. See you inside. I would give anything for them not to see you. Night will hide me. And if you love me, let them find me here. I'd rather die by their hate than live without your love. Who told you how to find me? Love told me where you are. I'm no sailor, but if you were across the farthest ocean, I would set sail for you. This is too quick. So, my love, goodnight. My love will blossom next time we meet. Are you going to leave me so unsatisfied? Do you love me? I know you will say "yes," and I will believe you if you say it's true. So, if you love me, tell me. That was great. Here we are. Is it possible to drown? No, you couldn't drown even if you wanted to. It's only 10 inches deep, and there's about 800 pounds of epsom salt dissolved into the water. That's why you float. Can you fill it deeper than 10 inches? Sure, I mean, that could fill it all the way up to the top. But why would you want to do that? We just use it to clean it. Do all float tanks use epsom salt? Most do. Epsom salt is basically just magnesium. Sea salt has lots of different minerals in it. Are you ready to float? Oh, Frank, it's Jenn. When you get this message, will you call Coroner Tramell and see if he saved a sample of the saltwater in Steve winters' lungs? Because if it's epsom salt, he didn't drown in the ocean. Thad and Kay will be here any minute. I got take-out Chinese food, just like their first date. Is this crazy? It was your idea, you tell me. Well, uh... Kay, hi! Thank you for coming. Happy to. Well, hello, Thad. What are you doing here? I was about to ask you the same thing. Your table is ready. Right this way. Kung pao and Shanghai noodles. I think that's right. This is just like our first date. With the wedding gifts already here. That's funny. I really loved this china. Did you really want to sell it? No. No, I really like it, too. We've-- I've-- been real stupid. Me too. I'm sorry. I don't believe it, you were right. Well, why else would he want those candlesticks? Where was he this whole time? Until a couple of days ago, he was in a fleabag motel up the coast. Manager said basically he was just in his room drinking the whole time. I can't even imagine his mental state. He gets in an argument with his brother, threatens him, and then Steve dies. But the phone message he left, he said he wanted to protect me. From what? Should I get us some more wine? Yes, thanks. "In the event of my death, "it is my intent to prevent the sale of idea dome. "I'm giving my brother, Todd Winters, voting authority "for all of my shares. "My partner, Mitch Harris, against my wishes, is attempting to sell the company..." I'm going upstairs, I'll be back in just a sec! Okay! Hey, red again, yeah? Perfect. Jenn, please pick up. Please... Hey, Anne. Anne? Okay. Okay, see? Thank you. Anne? At the beep, you know what to do. Anne, it's Jenn. Are you okay? I mean, did you just try to call me? Look, um, if you get this message, I'm on my way over. But call me back, okay? Hello? Oh, hey, Jason, honey, it's me. Um, I'm going to be a few minutes late. I'm going to swing by Anne's. Is everything all right? Oh, yeah, everything's fine, I just want to check on her. I know your voice, something's wrong. No, no, nothing's wrong. Nothing's wrong, um, I'll see you in a little bit. Bye, sweetheart. Put it on speaker. Let's hear it. Anne, it's Jenn. Are you okay? I mean, did you just try to call me? Look, um, if you get this message, I'm on my way over. But call me back, okay? Looks like we're going to get company. Mitch, what did you do? I knew Steve did something like this. He was going to give voting shares to that drunk brother of his. Unreal! Leave Jenn out of this. You want the company, it's yours, I don't care. Oh. Looks like Miss Marple. If we can come to an agreement, nobody has to get hurt. What's done is done, right? So... did you see this? No. Never saw it. You convince Jennifer that everything's okay, we're just talking about poor Todd and his drinking problem. Then what? Then she goes home safe and sound, I burn these papers, then I sell the company, and we both become very, very wealthy. And if she still suspects something? We'll have a problem. Anne, are you okay? I got a strange phone call. Everything's fine. Come on in, we were just talking about Todd. Can I get you a glass of wine? No, I'm fine. - Hi, Mitch. - Hi. How are you doing? So sad, huh? Can't say we didn't see it coming, though. Did you hear the message he left? He sounded delirious. He kept saying he was looking for something. I don't know, does it even matter anymore? Either way, that wraps up Steve's death. "Either way"? Yeah, if it was the surfer who drowned him, he's been arrested, and if, somehow, Todd killed his brother, well then, that's over now, too. You know what? I think I will have that glass of wine. No, you sit, I'll get it. Bring the bottle. On the counter, Jenn. I've got a feeling you know a little bit more than you're letting on. No. All I know is, either way, this is over, right? I thought so. Now I'm a little worried. Oh. We found what Todd was looking for. Steve authorized Todd to vote his shares. Should he die, he knew his idiot brother would obey his wishes. Between Anne's shares and Todd's, I would be blocked. Todd is gone. And they've arrested a suspect, so let it go. I can make this place look like another break-in, you two, victims. You don't need to do that, you've won. You think I killed him? Tell me how. - I never said that-- - Tell me-- or I end this right now. You knew Steve checked the surf report every morning. You checked the surf report yourself... and the surf was flat. So you knew Steve would be in the float tank... You drove by the house, park a good ways away, and you ride your bike back to the house... down the drive to the garage... The murder was simple... all you had to do was stick something through the handles of the tank, turn the valve on, and instant drowning. No way out. It didn't take long. You emptied the tank, dressed the body in a wetsuit, put the body in the back of the Land Rover, throw in a surfboard and your bike, drive to a deserted beach, put the body in the water, and ride away on your bike. Wow. Sounds perfect. Where did I mess up? You grabbed the wrong wetsuit, a summer suit, and you didn't know the direction of the current. If Steve had been out surfing, his body would have washed up South of his car, not North. And I knew you were a mountain biker. There was bike tire track leading away from the Land Rover. Amazing. Do you think I killed Todd, too? I don't know. I sat with him, gave him all the alcohol he would drink, and he was in so much pain. And then.. I covered his mouth until he stopped breathing. But you know where you really messed up? Where? My husband was expecting me home a long time ago. So? So, he worries. Even calls the police. Drop the gun, Mitch. Okay... Okay. Putting the gun down... Don't ever let anyone tell you that hitting someone in the head doesn't hurt. - Are you okay? - Yes. I knew something was wrong, I could tell by the sound of your voice. Frank called right after you. Yeah, you were right. I checked with the Coroner, and the water in his lungs wasn't from the ocean. I asked Frank to meet me here. Thank goodness, you did. I had it under control. Yeah, right. I can't thank you enough. If it weren't for you, Mitch would have gotten away with this. If Mitch is the bad guy, then who attacked him at his house? He hired someone to beat him up. How do you know that? I don't. But what better way to throw us off? It's only thing that makes sense. Isn't this cutting it a little close? Getting there. Hey, Frank, how about doing your job for once? Funny. You do not have to thank us. We were happy to help. It was a wake up call. For both of us. So... we want to ask you guys for one more favor. We want to have a ceremony to renew our vows. Oh! That's great. We like to have it here, in the store. Will have a wedding in the store? It is so romantic. It is. Why not? Yeah. Good. Hey, sleepyhead. Oh, hey, uh, there's more in the car? - Lots more. - All right. Hey, I'm making dinner. I'm going to Kyle's, so just save me some, okay? Whoa, whoa, whoa, how'd the audition go? Did you nail it? Yeah. It was, uh, fine. Mr. Elkins said I did a pretty good job. He said I "wasn't without talent." Oh, well, that's good news. And..? And the lead in the spring play always goes to a senior. But, uh, he wants me to try out again next year. Oh, are you going to? Nah... I think I'm just going to stick to computer club instead. But, uh... I coulda been a contender. Coulda been. Hmm... Coulda, woulda.
