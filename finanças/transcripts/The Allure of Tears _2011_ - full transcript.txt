This is my darling When he was young, he had a dream And now, he still has a dream A dream that belongs to him and me How bright Don't worry I won't let them take away our music academy I love you PART TWO How can I put together 3 million dollars in 2 months? Do you remember my idea before? Yang Lin? No way I know it is difficult Yang Lin retired suddenly a couple of years ago [t was a shock to all her fans around the world I know a rich guy. He told me If we could find Yang Lin He could then invite Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra to Shanghai To perform with Yang Lin If she is willing to make a comeback to raise funds for her Alma mater Raising 3 million dollars is no problem Even 30 million dollars would be possible Who could find Yang Lin? Ding Da Ke Look Our son has a talent for music He has been dancing, dancing to my music Look again, look What a genius The timbre and the passion Expressed through the cello, it's like... a father It is very natural and powerful, with a sense of security - Therefore when... - Teacher My daughter has had several lessons with you already You keep speaking to her in every session When will you let her play the cello? Mrs. Wong It's important for Xiao Qing to know the characteristics of cello And feel passionate about it Ok, I think you are just wasting her time. Let's go. Mom will find you another teacher Teacher... Hey, principal "Every note is a dream” Every dream has you and me" "It keeps guiding us" "To the eternity of music" "The spirit of fidelity" "The perfect pureness” "It shines and shines upon our spirit" "The world is the stage" "Life is the melody" "It is a never-ending song" "Dreams come true" Principal, you make us sing this every time we get together Come on, cheers I miss those days when we were studying in the academy We didn't have to worry about anything - Yes, that's right - It was good Those were the good old days Lin Yi Feng only weighed 150 lbs Look at him now He's 450 lbs now! And Xiao Dan, you were so into your looks That you wouldn't go under the sun for more than a minute But now, he works in the middle of the road Pointing here and there, from morning till night It's called: serving the people The number of traffic accidents come down a lot I am thinking... Does anyone know that Each of you has a super talent Does anyone know that the young boss of this restaurant Has very fast hands, faster than the wind Lu Hua, I've said for years That the sound of your flute belongs only in heaven Why did you get married so soon? Only Xiao Dan can use what he learned Although he couldn't get hired by an orchestra He found a job That lets him use his musical talents Principal... How about me? I have talent too? You... Your biggest achievement was... Going out with Yang Lin Once upon a time Not quite once, maybe half time He wasn't daring enough We tried so hard to set them up But he never found the courage to declare himself After Yang Lin became famous, he had even less courage That's not true, principal Yang Lin and I were always just good friends Now still? Now still That's right So good that you would do anything for each other Of course So am I your good friend? That goes without saying, more than a good friend You are like a father to me Good! Look, my son What is this? It is a letter from the bank The academy is bankrupt How can that happen? The bank will come and close down the academy in two months What should we do, then? If you could convince Yang Lin to do a concert for the academy We could be saved I can't do it, principal I'm afraid I can't This academy belongs to my wife and me Before she died, she begged me To keep the academy going Are you willing to help me? Principal... I... Hi, long time no see Hi Hi, long time no see Hi! Long time no see, how are you This place is very beautiful If you didn't mention this place to me in the past I could never find you I know you are still mad at me and want to ignore me - But... - She can't hear you Ding Da Ke, why are you here? Wei Yi, did you say she can't hear? What do you mean? At a concert 3 years ago I was standing on a very high stage And I fell off by accident Wei Yi didn't know what to do So she sent me to a hospital in a remote area via a secret exit My hearing ability is damaged since that accident I need to wear a hearing aid since then But even with the hearing aid, it's hard to hear clearly Because there's a loud echo I can't listen to music I feel I can never go back on stage to perform again I don't even want to see people I'm sorry. I can't help you this time So... do you have anything else you'd like to say to me? Da Ke... Principal. A call for you Principal. Yang Lin... She can't help the academy, I'm sorry Principal... Principal... Hello? Principal? Hello? I keep telling you that she is not deaf It's her hearing ability that has been damaged That's the same thing She can't hear either way If you really try your best She wouldn't say no I didn't try my best? Stop arguing Principal is awake... Principal Principal, you are awake Are you ok? Da Ke What did you tell me over the phone? Yang Lin agreed! You've done a great job I told you that this girl really cherishes friendship Our academy has hope Principal. Actually... How about Li Sheng? Has the Vienna Philharmonic arrived? We can't find Li Sheng at the moment Where is he at this moment? Pass me the clothes, I'll go myself! Principal... Don't rush, Didn't Da Ke promise you He will take care of it. Did you, Da Ke? Yes. And the doctor told you not to move too much Is it the case? No... Yes Principal It's her, Yao Jue? - Yao Jue? - Why are you in the hospital? Didn't you just perform in London a few days ago? Yes, thanks It's finished, the concert was a success I just got off the plane. Are you okay? I am fine, of course How can I not be fine with all these kids around me These are the students that you keep talking about I hope I also have good students like them Our academy is going to have a fund raising concert Fund raising? We are organizing a concert They are the one who organized it That's excellent Yang Lin will also come Yang Lin is going to come back from retirement? This is a grand event, then When is it going to happen? Da Ke We haven't confirmed the date yet. But it will be soon It should be held next month You have to come I will come Should you need any help, You can come to me You are so nice Thanks, Yao You're welcome Teacher, this is for you What is it? Aren't you organizing a fund raising concert? This is my donation Thank you Take your money back. There will be no concert Why? No special reason. It's just cancelled You should go Loser! Mom said you were not serious about organizing the concert She said you are a loser And said that losers can't do anything But I said you weren't Because you use your heart to teach me cello But now I do think you are a loser Xiao Qing I accept your donation I will organize the concert I will prove to your mom That her daughter has a better vision than her OK? Good. You promise Yes. I promise! Is that why you stopped playing the violin? I can't hear the music, so I can't play the violin Can you hear my talking then? I can, but... This hearing aid Generates lots of static. Whenever there's interference It is really hard to focus on listening to the music Yao, you are also a music lover You must understand How painful it is for me not being able to hear music If you really love music, there is no way you can't hear it Try to feel it with your heart, you will definitely hear it Come on, take off your hearing aid This is my Strad It has given me a lot of beautiful memories And a lot of inspiration Go ahead and play it If you use your heart to feel it I am sure you can hear the music Thank you Remember, deafness alone can't stop you Here we are So, I'll see you later. You work hard, okay? Can you go in with me? There are a lot of people in there Better not I want you to go in with me Where are all the people? How come you are all here? How about the Vienna Philharmonic? What happened? Did something happen? Answer me The thing is... They are not coming Was the flight cancelled or what? Be specific, Xiao Dan Li Sheng is here Li Sheng, you tell him Li Sheng, what happened? The guy called... and said The Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra thought it's too rushed Too rushed? How about we postpone the performance date for them? They won't come even if we postpone the date How can they be so unreliable? Let me call them No need to call They are not coming. Forget it Maybe they heard about my ear Let's just tell the principal the truth We cannot tell the principal Doctor said he cannot take any bad news Right. I don't think it's a good idea... to tell him the truth Forget it. Let's cancel the show I told you from the beginning that it won't work out Let's cancel it We cannot give up. We cannot cancel it What about Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra? Are they really that amazing? Even if they are We are not bad, too We? Think about it. Does the Vienna Philharmonic Have a clarinet player who is a traffic cop? Do they have a percussionist who can cook? Do they have a pregnant flautist ready to deliver any time? We can do it. Let's prove it to them There's only us here Right Don't worry. We have lots of alumni Our juniors Tell them to come back Tell them It's for the academy. It's for the principal And it is for ourselves We have to prove it to the world Great! I want to see if my skills are still sharp Good, Li Sheng Xiao Dan How about you? Me...
