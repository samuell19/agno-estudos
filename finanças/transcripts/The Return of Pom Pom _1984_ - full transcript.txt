What's matter! Seen high diving before. I'm the one who's jumping, OK? Get away. I like it, OK? You are all bastards! Keep away, or I'll jump. - Mr. Chan. - Come here. Is that your boyfriend up there? Ah Kuen. Calm him down, use a little sweet-talk. Make up your mind, you are troublesome, I'm busy from playing Mahjong. Be a man, just make up your mind and jump! Get in. Let me go, let me go. Why are you taking my girl? You faggot. Shut up. Call 2020, 2021. Don't you think it isn't the right time, sir. Can you manage it here? No. So call them, on the double. Yes, sir. Today is... Let's go. What're we going to do? Stay put, we'll be right back. Go, just go. Go, I like your sense of duty. Go, go. Laid off my girl, it's none of her business. Yes, you are responsible. Sure, take it easy. Where are they? Quick enough for you, sir? What a party! Didn't you see this sign? Told you to watch out. You'll get a ticket, now get him down. A trapeze act or something? Friends or relatives here, yet? That's his girl over there. Good looking? Well... What? You bum, I'll smash your face. No wonder he has to jump. So high, isn't it terrifying? I'm sorry, darling. You could be a bride, and a widow on the same day. Stop, Ah Chow, it's your wedding day. Good idea. Be careful! Beethoven, do you remember that similar case last time? We searched all over for the guy's parts. Yes, I know. Lend me your lipstick and make-up pencil. What's up now? Just lend them to me. You know what to do! Ah Kuen! I want to die, I'm dying for love. And for me. How could you do that? Don't leave me alone. I can't live without you. I've thought it over, take me with you. Let the whole world know of our devotion... With you? What a show! "Romeo and Romeo". Shut up! That's family business. Two guys dying for love. That's going to be talk of the town. So what, let the news spread. We're doing it... for the gay movement. Be bold, be proud, be Gay. Take it. I'm not gay, I'm not gay. It's time... for the truth. Don't come near. We're meant... for each other. Give me your hand. Let's hold hands. Right, holding hands, way to go. Let the world knows. Stop thinking, let's do it. Don't come near, I'm jumping! Alright, you go first then. And I'll make sure that... I'll land on top of you. Then we'll be together forever. Our parts will be mixed together. Yes, jump! Not only mixed together, but heart to heart. Jump! You want to jump? Just do it. You want to jump with me, let's go. Let's do it together. Go to hell together. I am afraid of height. Pull him up. Yes. I can't feel my feet, help! I'm not in love with him. That's great. Let me go, sir. You're alright, Beethoven? I'm afraid it's not a shoe. What shoe? It's you, stupid. I'm blessed. Back to our wedding. My wedding! Same thing. Gosh! A flood. Mom, there's a swimming pool. Nonsense! Open up, Beethoven! Who's going to pay... for this. Open up, quick. Don't come in, I'm naked. This is the third time... you flood the flat. It's like a waterfall outside. Someone might sue me. Open up now, Beethoven. I have something to tell you. What's your last word? I'm moving at the end of the month. That's what you think. I want you out now. That was... my original idea. My buddy Ah Chow wants me to move in with him. Who cares? Now turn off the tap. Hurry up, turn it off. What's up, Sherlock Holmes? Blackmail, rape, lobbying... none of the above. So what's the charge? Slaughter house with no license. A licence doesn't cost much. But he's trying to slaughter (rob) someone. Is that right? I don't think there's licence for man-slaughter. Sit down. Catch. Don't I look like "Mack the knife"? I don't know what you're pretending. But I'm not your toy, buddy. For the last time, what's your name? What's matter? His lips are sealed. Are you mute or something? You aren't a mute, faggot. Speak up or you'll be beaten. Answer me, you dumb! He's afraid you'll hit him. I'll hit him if he doesn't talk Talk, answer the officer. I... I stutter. You may think I'm making fun of you. What? Make... fun of the officer? Sit down, you said you wouldn't hit me. Talk. Who's... Who's there? Police station, who do you want? Is Beethoven there? He's not here, any message? Tell him to collect his things. Are you a relative of his? I was his landlady. I kicked him out this morning. He flooded... my flat. Do you know Beethoven got... kicked out of his flat. That's the second time in 3 months. He's coming. Going for a trip? Got kicked out by the landlady? I moved out on my own accord. The rent's too cheap? The room's too small. Big enough for you. She kicked you out. Who said so? I'm her favourite. She cooked for me, but I don't like it. Then you must break her heart. She begged you to stay, of course. Sure, but I stacked to my decision. You shouldn't have left. It's tough to find a nice place. I like to move around a bit. Are you all packed up? Sure, everything's well planned. Your landlady just called... you left something behind. She called? Too late, I've promised Ah Chow. He begged me, so I took the offer. But he's a family man now. And I'm part... of his family. Go ask Ah Chow. Beethoven. Madam. Madam. Good morning. What's the charge? He stutters. That's a crime? He's forger at stock exchange. He belongs to Commercial Crime then. Yes, Madam! Move. I must deal that imposter. 33, your report is overdue. It's in my car, I'll get it. I... Ah Chow will be here, he's parking the car. What's up? Why you brush your teeth here? I must get use to brushing my teeth here. Come here. Which way should the bed facing? Towards the window. Why is there a bed here? I'm homeless, I have to sleep here. Got kicked out again? You guessed it right. Lest you offer to take me in. What? I don't want to interrupt your life. The boys are teasing me. They said I'm an intriguer. True, we were happy together once. Time changes, you're a married man now. But I believe in friendship still. I'm moving... to the Wanderers' Home. That place is filthy, and weird. All sorts of petty crime, sometimes murder. I treasure this photo a lot, keep it. Remember me, if anything happens. Are you really going? Yes, good-bye, I'm going to register. Beethoven. Yes. Take care. Good-bye. Good thinking, but poor execution. Wonderful! You lived here before. But not with such warmth. Home sweet home. Ah Chow. Sis. Beethoven. What's for supper? You must stay for supper. I will. Darling, something I want to tell you. Let's go to the room. Lovely photo. How sweet! You were saying... Beethoven is an old buddy. You've told me. He learned to walk at 5 and talked at 7. He is quite normal now. Only he never learned to take care of himself. He catches cold in his sleep. You do too, So? He flooded the flat. So? The landlady kicked him out. What's his plan then? I've checked... a few Wanderer's Homes. You're kidding. But what's the alternatives? So when is he moving in? I've told him... to make himself at home. I have noticed. You're so understanding, darling. Excuse me. Didn't you learn... you had to knock before you enter. Oh, sorry! He didn't mean it... Let me kiss you. Come in. Now what? Just trying the knocking. Did I do it well? I'd like to borrow a towel. OK. I missed... the tub here. Thanks a lot. Now what? The soup is boiling over. I'll handle it. Are you alright? Fine. Got burnt? I'm fine. Go along then. What's the matter with you? Something needed to be covered. You go alone. Can you manage? Let me taste this first. You're a lovely couple. You forgot to knock again. How am I supposed to knock? Shame, walking around in underwear. I have no underwear on. Only a towel. There's underwear under the towel. No panties under the towel. You are making a mess of this place. Moving my things around. Don't you realize you have to ask first? Is it too late to ask now? Of course. But no one wears only panties here now. I used to do that. It's different now, my wife lives here. See, now go to your room. Why did you yell at him? We used to yell at each other. Do I yell out loud? Go and take a look at him. What's the big deal? You shoe-horn. I'll kick you like a ball. I'll find my own girl. Suzic. What's up? Asking me out? Maybe, I'll think about it. Telephone, Beethoven! Golden Empire, just you and me. It'll take me a while. Beethoven! I'm talking to my girl, she won't hang up. I will meet you then. Beethoven, use the phone in the living room. This one isn't hooked up yet. Suzie, ring up the one in the living room. I'm tired, I wanna shack up now. Suzie, didn't call last night? OK, enough jokes. Real redneck. Coffee or tea, misters? No, thanks. Inspector Chan called for us. Inspector Chan is on the way. Can I help you? My name is Sa Sa. Sa Sa, we are fine. She means well. This isn't old time. You might get snapped. Mr. Chan, Sir. Great, you're here. Good, remember my turtles? Of course, the bald ones. Nonsense, all turtles are bald. The female gave birth to a little one. How cute, it looks like Papa or Mama? Like you, idiot! All turtle look alike. Hasn't got a name for him yet. We'll call him Tiger. after Inspector Tin. Can't do. A little sense of humour, Sir. Two reasons that we can't. First, Tin's nickname... is Shark Tin. Second, you two have to report to him in 5 minutes. You've been transferred to his squad. You can't make jokes on your boss, right? What's that matter? Shark Tin can't stand unpunctuality. Right, don't you hate to see us go? This is a day to remember, to rejoice. Mr. Tin get any pet turtles. No, but pet fish. People who own pets can't be too bad. But he owns a baby killer shark. No need to panic though. Mr. Tin just got promoted, he's in good mood. One more minute left. Are you going or not? Yes. Come in and sit down. Relax, just like you're with Chan. Chou, will killer shark really kill? Rumours, who knows! Right. It doesn't kill. So it's all rumours. No, he doesn't kill, just bites. What's the difference? Don't be too nervous when Tin comes. We'll break the ice by being friendly. We must say something friendly. This is... His mother. Mr. Tin, Sir. How's your mum? Fine, thank you. Smoke? No, thank you. Behave yourself. Why did you steal his cigarettes? He'll run out and then I'll offer him one. Smoking again. No, I've quit. Come over, open your mouth. Smell of smoke, how come? Maybe it's the smoked salmon last night. If I see you smoke, you'll have it. Now go brush your teeth. Yes. Morning Mr. Tin, sir. 2020, 2021 report to duty, sir. Sit down. How's your mother? She looks terrific, she looks like as your sister. Like mother like son. What a coincidence the lady is here. Honey, you've left your pager in the car. Are you really so absent-minded? This is my wife. I'm going now. We'll see her out. Attention, sit down. Care for a smoke, sir? Good. I don't smoke. Everybody knows. you're a smoker. Right? I've quit. How come, we got these from your desk. Really? I said I'd quit, are you dumb? It's hazardous to your health, and others. You have no difference... from any hypocrite. Shut up and listen you illiterates. See how fit I am after I've quit. You're in my squad, you must quit too. Hand them over. I can't stand it. Tin. I said I've quit. But you said you couldn't stand it. You'll see when you back home. I must go now. Have a puff. Stop the nonsense, get that punk for me. His name is Snakie, now get for him. Yes. Where shall we start to look? There are only... 6 million people in town. Ask 6 million times and we'll get him. Of course, why can't I think of it? Maybe some clues inside, and expenses cover. Do I look like that kind of a guy. You don't look like, you are. No, I'm not. Move along then. Excuse me. Beethoven, why did you want to go in there? I reckoned a punk belongs in there. I know I was wrong, forget it. Just a second, you weren't all that wrong. But someone might take us as customers. Who's going to say? Right, we'll get and ask for some girls. We'll pick the gorgeous ones, like any customers. We are undercover. Must act like customers. Only the gorgeous ones have lot of contact with others. Right, it is a sacrifice on our part. Our reputation... is at stake. Quit the speech, going in or not? My sense of duty tells me to go it. What about your wife? A man's career comes first. Right. You have asthma? I'm clearing my throat, the smell of booze. Right. I don't smoke. Blow it all over me, cover the smell of perfume. Blow, harder. Over here. Now clear your pocket. Only these. I knew it. It's the clues for Anna to know where we've been. Just some souvenir. You said Anna would understand. I'm going up. You'll come up in 5 minutes. Where've we been? Playboy Club. Don't answer me, answer my wife. We had a meeting with Inspector Tin. For how long? Long enough for a few drinks. Be serious. About 4 hours. Now be alert. Right, I'll do as you say. Why close the door? I'm going up soon. Mr. Tin, they're not back yet. You're back, honey. Yes. Tired. Sure. So tired after... such a long meeting. Tin bombed us for the whole night, damn it. Had a meeting with Tin for the whole night? You thought I'd been fooling around. You said it. Do I look like such a person? It is alright to socialize a bit. The worst is to lie about it. Have a bath? Thanks my dear. Unfaithfulness is a major cause of divorce. Must be Inspector Tin. We parted only half an hour ago. He's called 7 times for the last three hours. Inspector Tin. How's it going with Snakie's case? Moving along. Right? And where have you been tonight? We've been working on it. See me first thing in the morning. Yes sir. Tin granted me permission to bath. Attention. So where have you been tonight? You may remain silence. Whatever you say... may be used against you. It's Beethoven's fault. How come? He begged me to go to the Playboy Club with him. He called up two hostesses, Cindy and Lily. Cindy sat on his lap, Lily sat next to me. Beethoven was on the dance floor all night. That's fooling around, isn't it? Still up this late. Let's go to bed, dear. You're lucky. Mercy on me. Tin called me back after you left. You must be very tired. Yeah, 5 whole hours. And what was the meeting about? The usual issues. Tin had given us 10 months to solve the case. That much? And then he changed it to 10 hours. Have you any clues yet? None! Tin was really mad. Tin asked us to clean the window. Oh no, he told us to open the window. Then something flew right in. Oh no, something flew by, a plane. We thought it was plane, actually it's a head. No... No. Big bird? Right, a big bird? It came right... right in. And then. It sat under a tree. Doing what? To pee. No... no, to shit. And onto Chou's head. And then the bird looked for some tissue paper. A bird looked for tissue paper? Hold it, that doesn't make any sense. I want to kill you. Attention! Your head is full of bird shit. Go clean. You can stay in the tub for the night. Dear, can I have a blanket. Use tissue paper. Don't worry, Chou. We're innocent. The truth will come out. You have a fantastic night, haven't you? Cindy was on your lap and you danced all night. So who's taking who to the Playboy Club? I warn you, don't make up any story. Talk. You bugger, you have given in. Well, tonight at 9:45. We went by a topless club. I said we might find some clues in there. He disagreed but changed his mind soon. I was on the dance floor and saw no topless gals. He was with them all night and said he was single. That's what happened. You bugger. Don't get mad, Chou was lying. But that's the first time, forgive him. Are you leaving? Don't go, let me be responsible for tonight. I didn't say I was leaving. I'll leave then. I told you so. Come in you two. You disappeared the whole day yesterday. And I haven't seen any... sign of Snakic. You want a transfer to the Traffic Cop Dept? No sir, but it's a big city. And I suspect he's... out of town. We should join the tour to South East Asia. Or the 5-day Disney World tour in Japan. Stop the nonsense. Yes. Someone saw him at the Phoenix Restaurant. Maybe he's back from Tokyo. Shut up. All information are here, and you want to argue. You want to go now, or shall I call you a car. No need, sir, we are going. Put you tools away. When I push you toward the wall, the first one who moved probably is the one. I'll know what to do. Waiter, a pot of the tea please. It's your turn. I'm clean, sir. Anybody moved? None. Show me your I.D. card. Haven't got it with me. Or haven't got it at all. Relax buddy. I know you're like us. From the mainland. Friends. Over there. Get in the car. This is my car. Move, quick. Beethoven. Forgive me. Don't worry, I'll get you out. Step on it, the cops are after us. This car has a small engine. OK, fire him when he comes near. This gun can't even shoot through the glass. How about this one? Don't drive too fast, I can't shoot straight. The car regain power now. He's lucky. Why you drive so fast? Don't chase me. Hurry, hurry. Let me shoot him, what's going on? We've shaken off the cop. Why don't we... going back to my den. Sure. Check if there are cops behind. Any cops. No, not a single soul. But there's a lot of in front though. Stop. Freeze. This is my den. Get off. Great performance. Sure, they are on the most wanted list. Now we have them, it's promotion time. Sure, and we'll be transferred. back to Chan's squad. Sure thing. Sir. All hell broke loose on the spot. The whole place exploded with action. Our lives were on the line. We fought the best we could, we make good use of our wisdom and instincts. And triumphed at the last moment. Did I tell you to take in? Shall I repeat again? I just want Snakie to be brought in. But these two are most wanted. Nonsense, there 3000 unsolved cases at our hands. Are you going to solve them all for me? But this is something. Shut up and give me a written report. Explain why you stick a hand in someone's case. Or I send you back to training. I'm looking for Chan. You look so happy today. What's up? $200,000 cash, it's court evidence. Put it in an envelope, signed and sealed. Yes. Do you have a few minutes, sir? I'd like to talk with you. What now? You are Tin's new pet, aren't you? We'll talk after the court case. Have to present the evidence. See you later. I'd like to transfer back. I told you. Tin needs more manpower. No wonder they call him Shark. He just looks like one. Stop the nonsense, see you afterwards. I'll buy you a drink, OK? Step aside please. Get off. You've hit someone. It's her own fault. I'm Police. Stand still, don't move. Have you seen that old lady? She went that way. Buddy, can I go now? Chen, your time is up. Thanks Heaven. Chan's in the meeting, looks like trouble. Shall we join the audience? Let's get in there. How? Follow me. Inspector Chan, would you explain please? How the $200,000... turned into blank paper. I have no idea. You had some idea I think. Maybe you're broke... and take the money. That's common thing. Don't get crooked. Come in. Morning, sir. Luckily the repair-men are available. Who told you the air-conditioner is broken? Beethoven, how did you know? I guess and its bull's eye. Very hot in here. Inspector Chan, if the money was stolen. This must be a well-organized person. Very well planned, but by whom? It's a trap. Such complicated circuit, a trap for repairman. You have a good record, Inspector Chan. We'll be fair and investigate this case well. People do change, though Chan is my man. I will not be biased. He has no heart. This machine has no heart. I give you 2 weeks. to retrieve the money. 2 days will do, if you put your heart to. Or else even 140 days is not enough. Such case needs 2 weeks at least. I'll say 2 day. 2 days is not enough. 2 days is too much for you. Nonsense, who's the boss here? Shut up. I didn't say anything. What are you up too? Revolution. You two get out, right away. Yes. He doesn't want air-conditioning. Out. Yes, sir. Two days, ridiculous. They've given me two weeks to solve it. Two weeks? Let's celebrate then. You think two weeks is enough. Those idiots, they shouldn't suspect you. Our Mr. Chan is straight as an arrow. Now you're like a pole, move. Beethoven... is just trying to help. You always step on others' toes. And not knowing it. Think hard, who did you step on lately? Someone you tortured? Money you owe? Someone who hates you guts? Right. Stick with me and you'll gain 2 enemies. Why? Because I'll broke his leg. Oh! It's him. Who's he? Follow him and you'll understand. It was 20 years ago. I thought it... only happened in old movies. It happened 20 years ago? Carry on. I was a young officer 20 years ago. Great, story time. A big crimes... happened 20 years ago. A cat thief name Flying Spider. Swift like a ghost, athletic. Some kind of a Robin Hood. He left a note after every steal. Saying, "Flyer Spider's been here". You really sound like... a story-teller. And the police force couldn't even touch him. Because Chou and I haven't joined the force yet. One day we had him cornered. Give yourself up, we have you surrounded. He's going up to Chan's floor, follow me. Give me your hand. He got up and in rage. He kept saying... You cheated me. That's how it happened. And Flying Spider became Lame Spider. It's corny, but not bad. He has good motive to frame you. He was cursing you while he fell. Idiot, he couldn't blame anyone. This idiot is setting up Inspector Chan now. Well, I'll go get him. Where is he going? Where do I look for him? An informer name Blindy, they were partners. A blind crook. He wasn't blind then. A blind man, that's a good clue. Only he dares not... admit he's Blindy. Then how do we find him? I taught you a song, remember? I remembered. This tune is the code. It's hot today. Come out, once and for all. Such old-fashioned clothes. It belongs to my grand-pa. I'm not your grand-pa. Let's go. I look so stupid. Crazy! My body is sore, it's your turn. This one. Who are you whistling to? The one behind. This one. No. Don't let me see your shoe-horn face again. He doesn't want to see your face. He don't wanna see your face too. Thanks, he has finished, go say thanks. Thank you, uncle. It's nothing. Paul, we'll go get something to eat for your papa. Are you a scout-master or something? You whistled too, didn't you? Blindy is a musician, what can I do? I've got it. Yes! I pretend to be blind too. And he'll take me as his own kind. You are both blind. And say hello when you see each other. No, that's wrong. You're always wrong. There's some better way to know who's blind. This one! I've forgotten my money, you go ahead. OK. Great stuff, is it Thai boxing? Sure... Oh, it's you? That's my father-in-law. The water's clear here, right? Where are you going? Shouldn't be this tough to find him. Something to drink? No, thanks. You'll have it when find you, Blindy! Waiter, anyone named Blindy here? Haven't heard of him. Blind, or colour blind, none what-so-ever. Blindy? Such a funny name. It's ridiculous. Have some peanuts. Thanks. How much is this apple? Not for sale. It's for decoration. How about the water-melon? It's hollow inside. The bananas? Good stuff, from America. It's all your fault. Blindy! You're Blindy, aren't you? Who're you? We're... I've been hiding for all these years. I dare not reveal my identity. Where's Lo Kin, the Flying Spider? He worked as a carpenter in National Film Studio. Have an apple. Apple? I won't whistle anymore from now. I got punched for whistling. And got kicked into a pool. Have you seen Lo Kin? Lo Kin, the lame? Yes. he quit a long time ago. Where's he now? How do I know? Old friend. Shut up. Camera here, the stunt man jumps, cut to close up. "The Sword Lady", Scene 18, take 1. Stand by, action. Stand by, action. Great, great. This shot is OK. Chou, my dream girl is right here. Right, you're daydreaming. Pack up. You alright, Mimi? I'm fine. Take a rest. You're not in this shot. Thanks. Swashbuckling Queen Ho Ding Ding. Miss Ting. Continuity problem, her head faces this ward. I know. What to do? Let me talk to her. What now? Are you going to shoot or not? It's better if you face this side. Why? Stunt girl faced this side when she jump. Easy, ask her to jump again. You blind? Can't you see I have a spot. Didn't you make sure beforehand? What to do now? Tell her to do it again. That Ding Ding is some bitch. She's the hottest star in town. She better watches her manner. Why are you so mad? She's nice to her clients only. Clients? Her sugar daddies. She's been seen... with different men at a hotel. Hardworking movie queen. She's with the divorced playboy Chiu last Friday. She's coming. Miss Ding Ding. We are reporters from the STAR. This is Beethoven, I'm Chou. Are you new? Haven't seen you before. I only deal with professionals. We have to write the truth then. Right. What truth? Miss Ding is a frequent guest at a hotel. Having afternoon tea with someone. Right? Right. Wrong, Movie queen works part-time at hotel. The lady refuses to elaborate. Doesn't sound good but it's true. Not bad. I can sue you... and your magazine. Playboy Chiu was been seen... with a girl at the Emperor Hotel. Who was the girl? You want an interview? Over here. It's quieter over here Someone's spreading rumours. Are you with Chiu at the Emperor last Friday? Friday? I was at the studio. Shooting? This film? Right. Your stunt girl can verify then. Let's go ask her. I'll call her over. Mimi, come over. What's up? Did you hurt yourself just then? No. Go see a doctor and send me the bill. No, thanks. Do me a favor. These are reporters. Say you had worked with me last Friday. Tell them you had worked last Friday. Yes, I had worked Friday. You're her stunt girl, then it's alright. These are rumours then. Can I go now? Sure. The last shot was OK. Director, no needs to shoot again. Anything you say. I'll give you a ride to town. No, thanks. I have a date. Well then, bye-bye. See you. You have a date? Just don't want her ride. She's going... Miss Yes? Something he wants to ask you. What about? Her name? And if she'll be free tomorrow. Your name? And are you free tomorrow? I'm Mimi, what do you want to ask? There's a new column. In our magazine. It reports on up-coming stars. Is that right? Title of the column is "Looking for a Star". Must be a tough job, keeping your eyes open. Sure, on the duty all the time. Fire, earthquake, typhoon, we'll be there. So you're news reporters too. Your job is much tougher than doing stunt. She's coming. You're a silent hero in behind the scene. We'd like to write an article on you. Let the whole world know of your great world. Nothing great about it. Nice weather these days. Sunshine and roses... What's all these nonsense? I'd like to ask her out to picnic. Great. Beethoven, everybody is waiting. You go ahead, I'll be a minute. Too much. Albert Au. Albert? This is Beethoven. Hi, Beethoven. Play it in 5 minutes, OK? Mi, right? No, it's Mimi. And, write down what I'm going to say. OK, shoot. Fair weather for picnic today. It tickles my heart-string. Nice to have company, right, Chou? Right! A friend give me a radio yesterday. Not bad, let's try it. Come on, you borrowed it from Chan. You said it's for your English lesson. All the same. How do you tune this thing? It's tuned, Albert Au's "Love Songs" is on. We can listen together. What are you doing? Listen to the radio. There's a lot of strange requests to "Love Songs". It's "Love Fever" from Ah Keung... to May, with feverish love. The next one is a special request. From Beethoven... to Mimi. Here is Beethoven's message. You're kidding me? Since the first saw you, I've known you're my Snow-white. I feel I'm in love with you. I'm the wind, you're the cloud. Let me embrace you, caress you, love you. What a loser! Beethoven, it's so corny, right? Well, a person in love... is a bit crazy. It'll take a while to settle down. We'll live like wind and cloud. Exists and need each other. And our future is like wind and cloud. A strong wind splits a cloud into small puff. And then turn into smaller clouds. Too much, why not simply say reproduction? Reproduction. I salute you. This has been a love men's confession. Almost as good as a poem. Good thinking though, very effective. And very corny, which turn the ladies right off. Splitting them into small puffs, eh? Even Beethoven, wouldn't do such stupid thing. Right, Beethoven? Of course not. You should thank me for that. Good luck, Beethoven... and happy puff-making. I feel sick all in a sudden. Deep in my heart there's a place. Reserve for you every day. I wanna look through your eyes. To see if I am the guy. Deep in your heart I shall see. That you are thinking of me. To hope you hope that I. Will be always by your side. As we stroll along the wood. All the memories are good. Sunshine fills up the joyous space. Sweet dreams sprinkle along the way. For then there is only you. All the things you say and do. Perhaps I shall show you my heart. That I've loved you from the start. You're OK. I'm OK. What brings you here? Flying Spider isn't with the film studio anymore. What'd I know? Go ask his daughter! His daughter? She's a stunt girl at the studio. Stunt girl? Same as my girl. Who cares about your girl. The daughter's name is Yuen Hung. Yuen Hung? I've known her since she's a kid. She likes fruit, water melon in the winter. Nothing special. Cute. You like it, it's yours. Thanks. Where are you going? Make-up room. What for? To see Mimi. Who's going to look... for Yuen Hung? You're... on your own. Not happy? Don't move! Listen to me. You know what I like? Your curly hair, like a poodle. And those dimples. I wanna kiss you. Good boy, shall we go out? Sure. Beethoven. Come see my Prince Charming. I'm looking at. It's him. Looks like you. Right, looks like me. I'm alone and he's alone. How come? He has me. Right, pity if he has... to cook for himself. What are you talking about? Cabbage-patch Doll, poor thing. Why? I'll take care of him. I'll do his laundry. I'll bath him. Really? Mimi, stand by. Take care of him. Yuen Hung, they're waiting. Thanks. Beethoven, that's her... Chou, hold him for a while. I'll go get something. It belongs to Mimi. Damn, Mimi is Yuen Hung. Beethoven's in love with Flying Spider's daughter. Hope he can take it easy. He's never good at handling failed love affair. He's used to being in love by himself. He'll be fine. Come in. Look. Lovely. I'm asking Mimi to marry me. I hope to enjoy... marriage life as you do. Are you happy for me? Great, terrific. Beethoven's changed. What? Strong willed and loyal. It doesn't sound good. Mimi, you understand me. You must marry me. But I lied to you once. I'm a cop not a reporter. You won't mind, will you? Mind that? Oh... I don't mind waiting. Something to drink? Grape juice, please. Mimi, we've known each other for a while. Only a week. It's a short while. But with your observation. You must have feelings over me. You're funny, and the good thing is... What? You're honest. Didn't like those who always tell lies. Right. But who will never telling lies for the whole life? Yes, but shouldn't lie to the one you love. Well, if then... Then? Then he's an asshole. With your job, you have to be honest. What about my job? You're a reporter, should give truth to the public. Don't you have to get back to work? Yes, but Chou is standing in for me. He's on call now. You said you wanted to talk to me. Yes, there were a few things. But I don't know what's left to be said. Frankly, I'm a... Please let me go, I'll go back home. Stop? Stand still. I hate cops. They're good to do the wrong things. Big bullies too, my dad says so. He would disown me, if I marry a cop. What were you saying? I want to tell you a joke. Don't get angry if it's not funny. Go on. I'm not a reporter, I'm a cop. I know you wouldn't laugh. A bad joke it is. I hate lies the most, Then the cops. I'm fine, I'm neither a cop or a liar. You're a good, loving man. Right, my job is... to spread love around. I want everyone to be full of love. I know you agree with me. You like to share this job? How? Share your love. To whom? Cute dog. Noble breed. I know what you're thinking. You must love children, me too. Children remind me of a happy home. A happy home reminds me of one thing. You and Chou work together, right? You knew that. You've always been together. Yes, now and always. Does he work part-time? We won't be allowed to. Right, a cop can't work part-time. Right. Lier. I'm not, Chou is. He's not uniform cop. - What is he? - He's a Plain cloth. He's 2020. I'm 2021. Look. Don't want to see you again. Mimi, I want to share our love together. Chou, how dare you! He's too much. Acting like a baby, let him go. Sky has fallen for no reasons. Stop, stop. Bugger, show a little modesty. What's all these for? Take it. I'm going out. Don't move. - Beethoven. - There's nothing to do with you. It's between us. I know you're honorable. Honey, dear. I know, dear. Now I'm as angry as he is. Anything else I can help? I'll do anything, except for that bugger. Take my soup out, please. OK. I'll fill one for you. Have some soup first. It's hot, careful. Thanks. Hypocrite. It not only hot, there're all sorts of creatures. Take a good look first. Sure, they're going to quarantine the soup. Take your soup, it's not guaranteed. Lovely soup. I have a habit, dear. I never take order. Don't take the soup then, it's poisoned. It'll kill you slowly. What are you talking about? You bastard, you're traitor. You've driven Mimi away from me, scum. Stop bothering me, scum you are. I wish Mimi would send you to hell. And be a wandering ghost. I'm sorry. I can't stand... him anymore. You're acting like a child. Stupid fool. He should be grateful to me. I did it for his own good. Tell him who Mimi really is, or he'll hate you forever. He'll never believe it. Tell him to ring Mimi and ask for Yuen Hung. He'll know... when Mimi answers. Idiot. Is Yuen Hung there, please? Work notice? Yes, work notice. Wait a minute. Hi, Yuen Hung. Yes, what's it? Beethoven. What now? What else. Just don't think about her anymore. Not even a tiny thought? Beethoven, well done! Chan will appreciate. I'd sacrifice the rest of my life. Action, let's go to her place. Arrest the spider. Look at your dad's craftsmanship. You're upset! Dad. OK. You have to tell me. You might get angry. Will I? I've met a guy. That's a good thing. He looks funny, and he's a good guy. Not very good looking, I bet. For real? What does he do? Civil servant. It's fine if he's not a cop. What if he is? Then I'll kill him. Come on, he's not that Inspector Chan. They are all the same, he might be close to Chan. Did he just phone? That guy asked for Yuen Hung and hang up. You've told him your real name? No, I've not. What's the gun for? That's for our safety of course. Check yours. It is pressed. Yes. Mimi, we come to see you. Come in. Miss Lo. My dad's here. Dad, this's Beethoven, and he's Chou. My dad had a stroke 15 years ago. He can't move from the neck down. Terrific. What? No, no, Chou... You have only one father? Isn't that enough? Mr. Lo, I'm Beethoven. How are you? Not good, Mimi suffers because of me. I like taking care of others. Mimi and I will look after you. What did you do, sir? Before getting stroke. I was a thief, the famous Flying Spider. Don't worry, I'm a fortune-teller. The best is yet to come, because you will have a great son-in-law. Beethoven, come help me with the drinks. Hey, where's my money? Have you found it? I'll tell you when I do. What are you doing, Chou? Looking for the money. Let me help you. How can you drop the money? It's not what I want. Where've it been? We're still looking. I've found it. Good work. Sir, have you tried physiotherapy? No need. It's very constructive. And useful. So they say. Go see if dinner's ready. Smell good. Have you try radio-therapy? May be effective. Come help me, Beethoven. Can't figure it out. Here's the drink, Chou. Thanks. Don't move, I'll take it out. No, no, don't come near. Sir, are you alright? Dad, are you OK? Damn you, radio-therapy is useless. I'm alright. You're alright, sir. Sorry to bother you for so long. We're better go. Excuse us, sir. Good-bye. You're alright, dad? See, his dad is no crook. That proves she hasn't got the money. Great guy. He deserves a good son-in-law. Right. Let's go see Chan. Hi, Inspector Chan. Found Flying Spider yet? Yes, but he's disabled now. From the neck down. It can't be him. Right, I've tested him. Where are you going? To reconcile with the Spider. Terrific, it's about time. That Beethoven, very honest, a bit too much. Dad! Mimi, my boss Inspector Chan. Just a friendly call. Do you recognize me? I recognize you, even from six feet under. Sir, we were Inspector Chan's men. Not anymore though. So we have nothing to do with him. Opportunist. Just being objective. I feel really bad about that accident. Every time the weather's bad, my feet remind me. Must be hard for you, taking care of your dad. Soon she won't be alone. Yes. Just some money, hope you don't mind. No, thanks. Sir, you're going get sacked. Save some for yourself. Shut up. But it's true. I'll leave it here. Save it... for your retirement. There is little left of me. But I love to see what'll happened to you. So, it is you. Don't go. Sir... I'm not going to fight. Stop it dad. Don't go. That's my gun. You're gonna shoot my father-in-law. No, I'm not. Give it back. No, not a chance. It's not loaded. Really? Yes. Just wait and see. Are you alright? Sir. Move. OK. Sir, I'm behind you. Give me a hand, Beethoven. Nothing to do with me. Can't last any longer. Sorry, Inspector Chan. Lock him up. You cheated me. Freeze. Don't. His gun is unloaded. You want Chan in jail? Sir, don't move. You took his money. He has to go to jail. Leave the money and you can go. No way, we have to explain the money. Beethoven. No way, can't arrest him. We need to handle Tin, and save Chan's ass. What to do now? How would I know? You always have ideas. I don't care, just think a solution, or we'll stay up the night. Two weeks is up. 2722, open the safe. Yes. Inspector Tin. What did Inspector Chan say on the phone? He's waiting at headquarter. He's history. Oh, what have you done, Inspector Chan. Let me see. Breathless. What've you done? I... A young girl, full of vitality is killed. Think of her dad, her mom, her granny... What to do now? Maybe she's still have chance. Let's take her aside. Let me help you. Are you alright? Let's go, go! Stop, don't go. Stop. Don't go. Stop. Move away! You two! Don't go. Don't go. We need a car. There's one over there. Hey, don't go. Get in, sir. This is much faster. You jog with me everyday, how about work? This is slower. Is that right? Damn, I can't handle it. Thanks for me, sir. It's alright, I've checked. Those are the evidence money. Inspector Tin, are you still insisting... that the money was swapped? Right, they are my witnesses. What? Don't know what you're talking about. I was with Chou at the restaurant this morning. Then we went to play video games, until we got your call. Right, then we went for the Ferris wheel. It was fun. Shut up, stop kidding! We're telling the truth. But you're the boss, we'll obey your order. You two... You can go now. Yes. You're the prosecutor in Chan's case. Now it's you who confuses me. It'll be you who's going to write a report. You can go now, Inspector Chan. Thank you, sir. Congratulations. Everything's fixed now. We shall let bygone be bygone. Sure, sure. Where have they gone? Inspector Chan! Louder, I can't hear you. We said 1... 2... 3. Are you alright, sir? You two. It's Beethoven's fault. No! It's my father-in-law. He said you had to try it to know... the feeling of falling from high... Come back. Help, don't...
