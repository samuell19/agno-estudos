Hey. David, I just heard from Alan Fairlawn. He's reviewed your proposal for his new building. I need you to come back to the office as soon as you can. Uh, I'm actually-- Wait. Is there a problem with my design? I'd rather not discuss it over the phone, Dave. Okay. I can be there in 30 minutes. I'd suggest you make it 20. - Ooh! - Oh. I am so sorry. Excuse me. No, please. It was my fault. I'm still getting used to driving on the other side of the road. Gift card. How very creative. Uh, yeah. No. It turns out it's quite hard to find the perfect Christmas present. And yet everybody keeps trying. Happy Christmas. - Taxi? - Taxi. There we go, doll. There you go. Taxi! Oh. Hey. - Sorry. - Oh! Oh. Uh. - Hi. - Hi. Sorry. Uh-- Well, they do say London is a small town. I love these buses. I'm almost never on them. My car is in for repairs. Something about the brakes or something. The brake line? - I think it's the brake line. - Sorry. I really need to, uh-- I'm so sorry. I don't mean to bother you. So, what brings you to London? I'm an architect at Fitzsimmons Associates. Moved here from New York about six months ago. Okay. That's a long way to come for work. Well, they made me a very good offer. Well, to be honest, I was actually spinning my wheels in New York anyway. - And now? - Well, things are looking up. I've got a brand-new project at work. New girlfriend. We're actually spending our first Christmas together this year. Hmm. Well, this city practically invented Christmas. I'm sure you'll have a wonderful time. Yeah. Looks like you will, too. Oh, no. These aren't mine. They're for work. I'm a personal shopper. Oh, right. What is so funny? Oh. Uh, no. I just, uh, never really met one before. I'm not surprised. If you had, you wouldn't be buying things like that. What do you have against gift cards? They're perfectly reasonable, but, uh, they're kind of like giving up, aren't they? Uh, no. It's not exactly how I see it. In my business, I don't give up until I find the perfect gift. Well, with all respect to your talent, I'm not sure there is such a thing as a perfect gift. And if there is, I don't have time to find it. So, you know, for now, I'm going to take my chances with the gift card. Okay, so, uhh... - This is my stop. - Oh. Here, here. Let me help you. - Oh. - I got it. - Thank you. - That's okay. I got it. Thank you. - Thank you. - Right. Listen. About what I said before? You know, about the gift card thing. It's actually a really nice Christmas gift. Well, thank you. Let's just hope that Charlotte thinks so. Uh, is Charlotte your girlfriend? Why? So, you're giving a gift card to your new girlfriend for Christmas? Uh-huh. Huh. Well, Happy Christmas. Oh, I know what you're doing. Uh, you do? Oh, yeah. You're trying to get me to second-guess what I got my girlfriend for Christmas. And you're trying to make me think that I need to hire you to buy her the perfect gift. Oh. Is that so? Mm-hmm. And, uh, while I appreciate the effort, I can assure you I don't need any help. See, Charlotte and I, we decided to keep holiday celebrations simple. You know, without the ugly sweaters and the sugary cookies and the fa-la-las. No fa-la-las. Got it. So, I'm just going to wish you a very Merry Christmas. Thank you. And a Happy Christmas to you. All the best for New Year's. - The same. - And goodbye. Goodbye. It's a perfectly good gift. Simon: David. Finally. My bad. - I couldn't get a cab, so-- - We need to talk. Uh, yes. You said it was about my Fairlawn designs. - Is there a problem? - No, no, no. Fairlawn likes it. Oh, oh. Well, that's great. Yes, it is. But it's also your first London project. Mm-hmm. There's still one little hurdle we have to clear. Hurdle? Uh, what hurdle? Alan Fairlawn is reviewing proposals from two other design firms. Ah. Mm-hmm. And well, he wants to meet with the key architects in person. So, I've scheduled a meeting for you with him at his office in Chelsea tomorrow at 4:30. Tomorrow? Yes, yes. I know it's almost Christmas, but he's planning to award the contract before he heads to the Canaries for the holidays. Oh. I hope it won't be a problem. No, of course not, Simon. Whatever it takes. See, that's one of the things that impressed me most about you when I met you in New York. Your talent speaks for itself, but there are plenty of good architects. You know, what I like about you is you're ambitious. You have drive. You're not afraid to push yourself to get the job done. It's also one of the reasons I'm so pleased about you and my girl Charlotte. Well, dating the boss's daughter is never easy, but you two, now, you seem to be doing it right. Well, we're a great team. And well, with her, it is easy. We have so much in common. We love architecture. We love this city, and-- Yes, yes. Marvelous, David. Now, I can't impress upon you how important this meeting is. Fairlawn is one of the biggest developers in the city. We've been trying to crack that nut for years. So, you won't just be selling yourself. You'll be selling our company, too. I'll give it my best shot. I hope you do more than that, David. I'm counting on you. Yes, sir. Don't let me down. Yes, Mum. It's just arrived. It's beautiful. Thank you. Oh, good. I was worried. The delivery man apparently couldn't find an Anjali Patel anywhere. Who is this "Anji"? I don't recognize that name. Yes, Mum. But just please, no more. All right? Between the tree and the garland and the wreaths that you sent me last week, I think we have got Christmas sorted. You know how I worry, dear. How's work? It is great, except everyone has left their orders until the last minute this Christmas. Well, you won't have to worry about that much longer. Dad will be retiring in a couple of years, and then you'll be taking over. Uh, I've got to go, Mum. The Hungry Manchester has been with your father's family for years. Now, we've talked about this. You've actually talked about it, Mum. - Good. So, it's settled. - Sett-- ♪ Jingle bells, jingle bells jingle all the way ♪ Okay. Mum, I'll call you later, okay? I love you. Bye. ♪ Jingle bells, ooh jingle bells, ah ♪ Okay. Somebody's in a good mood. You know that cater-waiter gig I have at the Landmark Hotel tomorrow night? Oh, yeah. The Charles Dickens party? Mm-hmm. Well, I just found out that Dennis Crawford, one of the biggest casting directors in the city, is going to be there. And I get to play Mrs. Cratchit right in front of him. Wait. I thought that was, like, a black-tie event thing. Oh, no, no. That's just for the guests. The rest of us get to dress up like we're in "A Christmas Carol." Well, wow. Well, I know it's no Noel Coward, but at least I get to audition and serve crab cakes. What about you? What are you doing tonight? Well, I'm just finishing up the last of those Christmas presents, and then I'm going to get right back to work on my book. I've only got one chapter left. Oh. I thought you only had one chapter left last month. Yeah. So, don't rub it in. Why don't you take a break? You know, live a little. You might meet somebody. Because this is my busiest season, and I am not interested in meeting anyone during Christmas. Well, a gift whisperer has to have a life, too, you know? Oh, I don't have time for a life, because I have a brand to build. And besides, if I do not sort out these packages, someone is not going to get their lovely little prezzie from Carltons. Ooh. A gift card? Not your most inspired gift, Anj. This is supposed to be an engraved platinum necklace. Oh. Well, maybe they can trade it in on Boxing Day. Oh, no. Ooh. Hey. Hope I'm not disturbing the genius at work. Ah, disturb away. Daddy said you'd probably be busy, - but I thought... - Uh-huh? ...that you wouldn't mind, since it's such a special day. It's always a special day when I get to see you. David, you don't remember, do you? For the man who has his whole life planned down to the minute, I can't you've forgotten. It's our three-month anniversary. Oh, I knew that. - Mmm. Did you? - Oh, I was just testing you. Well, we should celebrate. I'm taking Mummy out for lunch. You should join us. I can't. Honestly, I got a lot on my plate today. Right now, I'm juggling proposals. I have a big meeting now today. It's always about work with you, isn't it? Tomorrow night is Christmas Eve. Are you sure that you can't take just a little bit of time away? Char, I'd love to. I really would, but I got to focus. Remember, I'm still new here. I'm trying to fit in. Well, Daddy certainly thinks you fit in very well. Well, he has to say that. I'm dating his daughter. I'd rather hoped that we're doing a little bit more than just dating. I was kidding. - Were you? - Mm-hmm. Because I thought that we needed to talk about taking our next step. - Our next step? - In our relationship, which-- I'm assuming you think that we have a future together. Char, of course we have a future together. I mean, it's already been three months. Mm-hmm. The greatest thing about Christmas is you can eat your whole body weight in sugar and nobody blinks at you twice. Am I interrupting something? No, Callum. I was just leaving. Hmm. Oh, let me get this. Thank you, Callum. Char-- Mummy is waiting. She's left all of her holiday shopping to the last minute, and she says she can't do it without me. - Oh, no. - Mm-hmm. David, do you promise you're going to be there on Christmas Eve? The whole family are going to be there tomorrow night, and they said that they can't wait to meet you, finally. - Promise I'll be there. - Okay. So, I need you to look over these specs for the waterfront project before I submit them. Yeah. Just, uh, put them on the pile there with the others. Mm-hmm. I'm sorry. Oh, come on. Really? Sorry. Mm-hmm. - What? - David, as your only friend, do you mind if I give you a little bit of advice? Have I ever been able to stop you? No. So, this is your first Christmas with your girlfriend's family, which also happens to be your boss's family. They're going to judge you. Mm-hmm. Every single one of them, right down from your table manners to the gift you give Charlotte. No. See, Charlotte and I have already discussed this, and we have decided not to make a big thing out of the Christmas holidays. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's what she says, but trust me. This kind of thing can make or break a relationship. And for you, a career. Hmm. Well, how long have you been with your husband? Ugh. 400 years. Why? What are you getting him for Christmas? Ski trip to Gstaad. Ethan's always wanted to go. That actually does sound like the perfect gift. Yeah. Well, I learnt my lesson the hard way. See, the first year we were together, I really messed up with his Christmas present. He didn't speak to me until Valentine's Day. What did you get him? Gift card. It was terrible. Oh, no. I can tell you that he has dark hair. And he is-- He's about this tall. I'm sorry. Unless you have a name, I can't let you go back there. Excuse me. Fitzsimmons Associates. How may I direct your call? Oh. Wait! Excuse me! Miss, wait! You can't go back there. No. No, no, no. She was shopping there yesterday afternoon. Hi. Oh, I'm so sorry. Back to work. Oh. She had a big teddy bear. - Hey. - Hey. You've got my-- Sort of expensive item to replace, you see? I'm sure it is. Um, how did you find me? I pay attention to details. Part of my job. Well, lucky for me you're good at it. Thank you. Yeah. Uh, I don't even know your name. David. David Burnside. Anji. Anji Patel. If you're my friend. And if you're my mother, it's Anjali. Guess I'd better stick to Anji, then. Thank you again, and Happy Christmas again. And the same to you, again. Um-- I found him. Wait. Uh, Ms. Patel? Um, Anji? How does your service work, exactly? Would I pay you and you go shop for me? I thought you had your Christmas all planned. Well, I did. I mean, I do. But did you change your mind about the gift card? No, not exactly. It's just I'm new to the city, and well, I want to keep my shopping options open. Oh. So, in other words, you changed your mind about the gift card. Sorry. I have taken all the last-minute orders I can handle this Christmas. Whatever you charge, I'll pay double. Please? I need to find the perfect gift. How did we meet? Well, it was at the office. Charlotte invited me to a charity event at the Museum of Architecture. Milk? Oh. Thank you. Charlotte is on a committee to support education programs to get kids interested in careers in design. That's very impressive. Oh, well, that's Char. Always trying to make the world a better place. She sounds like a wonderful person. Oh, she is. No question. I remember seeing her at that charity event. Oh. Thank you. This elegant figure standing in front of a photograph of the Battersea Power Station. And we talked all night about the Art Deco period, and why it started, why it ended. And, well. And then we met for coffee, and then we went on a date, then another date, and, well, suddenly, it's been three months. Well, they say when you know, you know, right? Mm-hmm. Absolutely. Right. Okay. Next question. What is Charlotte's favorite movie? Her favorite movie? Uh-- Well, would it be a drama or comedy or a mystery, or-- I don't know. Okay. We can come back to that one. What about the first prize she ever won? What do you mean by prize? Well, I don't know. Like, a sports trophy, yeah. Or a spelling bee. - Something like that. - I have no idea. Okay. We can come back to that one, too. How about the first piece of art she ever bought? The last book she read? Her go-to Karaoke song? Look. Do you really need her whole biography? I mean, we just-- You're just buying her a Christmas present. Okay, David. I don't think you completely understand what it is that I do. It's not like I'm just popping down to the local Sainsbury's and loading up a cart. No. I didn't mean to, uh-- A great deal of thought goes into this process. See, I make personal selections based on a client's profile, and then I submit options. That is how this works. Sure. Sorry. Got it. How about her birthday? March 10th. Hmm. 12th. You didn't give me much to go on here, David. But well, maybe when we get to our first stop, something will jump out at us. Wait. What do you mean, "our" first stop? You want me to come with you? Well, to get this done in time, I think you're going to have to, David. But I thought the whole idea about a personal shopper was that I pay you and you go shop for me. Yes. That is normally how this works. But in this case, by the time I get to the shops, I make my selections, text you photographs of them for you to choose from, and then wait to see if you actually like any of them, it'll probably be Boxing Day. Yeah. See, the thing is, I can't take the rest of the day off. I got a very important meeting that I need to make, so-- Well, you do take lunch, don't you? Typically? No. Oh. Well, today, you do. Huh. - Callum? - Personal shopper? Yeah. It's a long story. And now, I'm going Christmas shopping. Aren't you supposed to be meeting Alan Fairlawn today? Yeah. That's at 4:30. I'll be done in plenty of time for that. This is about Charlotte's Christmas gift, isn't it? Uh, yeah. Let's just keep that between us, shall we? If anyone asks, I'll be back right after lunch. David, you're finally listening to my advice. It's a Christmas miracle. Goodbye, Callum. David? Okay. So, I'm in. Good. Bought us a couple of hours. So, should we get a cab? No. We're in a hurry. All that hailing and paying and climbing in and out will eat up the whole day. Besides, I got my car back. We should start at Charlotte's favorite store. - Her favorite store? - Mm-hmm. Great. Another question I can't answer. Don't worry. While you were on the phone, I looked up Charlotte's social media pages. I counted up all her most frequent retail location check-ins, and found the store that she spends the most time in. Wow. You really have this down to a science. They don't call me the Gift Whisperer for nothing. Uh-huh. "Gift Whisperer." Hmm. So, how did you become the Gift Whisperer? Started in college. My roommate couldn't figure out what to get her boyfriend for Christmas. So, you helped her? I looked everywhere. I must have gone into a dozen stores. I wanted to find the perfect gift. So, what did you get him? He was always late to things. It would drive my roommate crazy. So, I bought him a beautiful wristwatch with his name engraved on the back. Did he like it? He must have. They got married the next year. Wow. Anyway, it gave me an idea. And when I got my MBA, I decided to put it to good use and start my own business. Well, what about you? What about me what? Well, you know. Have you ever given a wristwatch to someone special of your own? I never found anyone who wanted to wear one. I think of gift giving like a Venn diagram. One circle is for what people need. One circle is for what people want. And the third circle is for what people love, And here, where they overlap-- The perfect gift? Now you're catching on. So, let's start with what she wants. Uh, well, if knew that, then I wouldn't have bought her the gift card. Not helpful, David. Come on. She's your girlfriend. Think. She did say that she wanted to travel more. Now, we're getting somewhere. This one expands into a full wardrobe. Perfect for the modern traveler. Uh, I don't know. This one has its own GPS system. You'll never lose your luggage again. Clever. Or check out this little beauty. Stainless steel, light as a feather and has a built-in espresso machine. Really? No. I was just seeing if you're paying attention. We are just looking. Thank you. Fine. If you need me, I'm in handbags. I'm not feeling this. Let's just move on. Let's move to what Charlotte needs. Oh. Well, that's easy. Nothing. You said she attends charity events. That means she dresses up. And that means she needs jewelry. So, how did you become an architect? Well, I guess it came naturally. Both my parents were structural engineers. They went traveling the world. You know, building bridges, dams, that kind of thing. I'm picturing you in your crib, building skyscrapers with blocks. Something like that. Anyway, my parents retired to the Bahamas a few years ago. Mm-hmm. And, well, I guess I'm carrying on the family tradition by way of being an architect. Sounds like it's wonderful work. Yeah. No, it is. I'm usually either designing something or planning a project, or on a building site troubleshooting with construction. It's pretty much a 24-hour-a-day job. Hmm. Do you get time to have a life? Not really, but I always thought the whole "having a life" thing was overrated. Clerk: March birth stone, aquamarine. The setting is platinum, as is the chain. It's beautiful. What do you think? Oh, it's very nice. "Nice"? Yeah. I think a necklace seems kind of personal. I'll let you two discuss it amongst yourselves. Excuse me. Thank you. It is already personal, David. She's your girlfriend. Yeah. But I mean, a necklace is, you know-- I'm not sure that I'm ready for the jewelry step yet, you know? Okay. So, don't take this the wrong way, but maybe you're overthinking this thing just a little bit. Or maybe for someone who calls herself the Gift Whisperer, you're under-thinking them. Then maybe you should just give her the gift card. I'm sure she will love it. Wait. Wait, wait, wait. Okay. I didn't mean what I said. Honestly, this is embarrassing. Charlotte and I have been together for three months. Why can't I find her a Christmas present? I need to say it can take a lifetime to really get to know-- What are you doing, David? - Shh. - Did you just shush me? It's Charlotte. What's she doing here? Well, it is her favorite store. She thinks I'm at work. If she finds out that I hired someone to find her a Christmas present, that would not look good. Okay. I think they're gone. Come on. Let's get out of here. David? What are you doing here? Uh-- Hey. Hi. You must be Charlotte. Hi. I'm Anji. I've heard so much about you. Funny. I haven't heard a thing about you. Katherine, how are you? Hello, David. We're still seeing you tomorrow night? Wait. I'm sorry. Why are you here? It's my fault. David is doing a project for my company. - A building. - Mm-hmm. We were on the way to the site, and I needed to drop off here. You know, pick up a few Christmas things on the way. It was right on the way. Well, I certainly hope you're doing better than we are. We've been parading up and down the high street for hours, and I still haven't finished my shopping. It is a challenge to find the right gift for a person, isn't it? For example, Charlotte, what would your idea of the perfect gift be? Oh, I don't know. That's one thing that David and I have in common. We decided that we're not going to make a big fuss over Christmas this year. No, no. No big fuss. And we decided that just one special gift this year would be sufficient. Yep. Uh, one special gift. I love Christmas. I have so many special memories from my childhood. What about you, Charlotte? Do you have any special childhood Christmas memories? Well, I should think she does. She used to make the most horrid fuss if we didn't take her to the Christmas market displays every year. She had to have a hot spiced cider and her shortbreads. If we didn't get to Santa's grotto, she was simply unmanageable... Please. ...until her birthday came around in July. Please stop it. July? Well, will you look at the time? Uh, we better go if we're going to make it to the building site. And, uh, Katherine, always a pleasure. Char, I'll call you. - Yeah. - Nice to meet you both. What a peculiar girl. Yes. Wasn't she? Ah. - What's wrong, David? - What's wrong? "How about you, Charlotte? Have you any special childhood Christmas memories?" Real subtle. What's the big deal? It's not like we were doing anything illegal. You don't know Charlotte. I'm starting to think that you don't, either. You said she was born in March. Okay. So, sue me. I was four months off. Pardon me, sir. Store security. I believe you have merchandise you haven't paid for. Oh. Completely forgot. Of course you did. I'm going to need you to come with me. What? I've had my eye on you two since you came in. The happy couple at Christmas. Oldest shoplifting trick in the book. Shoplifting? Come on. Hey! Please don't make a scene, sir. The police have already been notified. No. I mean, this was a mistake. I didn't-- - This way, sir. - Look. The queen! David, run! Stop! Get back here right now.

I really have to make this meeting. Don't worry. You'll get there. Besides, we're here. Where? Didn't you hear what your girlfriend's mother said?

You know, my parents were here on a project once, and they sent me for Christmas one of those famous English hampers full of this stuff. - Hmm. - Including my first mince pie. Loved them ever since. So, you didn't spend your Christmases with your mum and dad? Um, actually, not a lot. No. They were usually on the other side of the world working at Christmastime, They must've missed you. No. They did, and I missed them. But, well, you know, you get used to things, right? So, how did you spend your holidays, then? Well, I was at boarding school, so it was just me and a couple of other kids, a few teachers with nowhere else to go. We would sneak into the kitchen and make a big dinner. And then afterwards, we would trade all the presents that we got from home that we didn't want. - That sounds kind of fun. - You know, it was. It was, but I always wondered what it would be like to have a real, you know, family Christmas. Lots of noise. Kids running around. Big table. Everyone fighting over the same bowl of cranberry sauce. Well, you're spending Christmas Eve with Charlotte with Charlotte and her family, aren't you? Yeah, I am, and I'm sure it will be very nice. But I'm guessing there's going to be more than one bowl of cranberry sauce. We're running late. Yeah, and I have another idea for Charlotte. There's something in this shop I want to show you. - Miss Anji. Happy Christmas. - Happy Christmas. What a great store. Appreciate the compliment. Miss Anji is one of my best customers. Kind of last-minute for you, though, isn't it? Just one gift left, and I have a feeling we're going to find it here. Have you still got that ruby brooch? I'm sorry. Someone bought that the other day. But I've still got that pen you've had your eye on all year. Not quite yet, I'm afraid. Well, it'll be waiting for you when you're ready. Thank you. So, what did he mean by "when you're ready"? I promised myself a gift when I finished writing my book. Oh. So, you're a writer, too? Trying to be, anyway. Why don't we try the market in St James's Park? So, what's the book going to be called? The Gift Whisperer: Anji's Guide to Good Gifting. Nice. Come on. Let me see. Well, see what? How would you know that I have it on my phone? 'Cause I saw you playing with it. Come on. Here. Nice. So, am I going to be in it? Uh, not at the moment. It's a work in progress. Honestly, I'm having trouble with the ending. Really? You want to run it by me? - Really? - Sure. Look. I'm no writer. But well, when I'm working through an idea it helps to talk it out with someone. Okay. So, it's about finding the perfect gift. - Uh-huh. Obviously. - Mm-hmm. But it means something different to everyone, doesn't it? Uh-huh. And I can't quite figure out how to sum it all up, you know? Make my final grand statement to end the book. Huh. Sometimes the only thing harder than starting something is ending it. Oh. Excuse me. - Can you just-- - Oh, sure. - Thanks. - Of course. Of course. Sorry. Callum. Hey. David, where are you? Uh, believe it or not, St James's Park. Look. Alan Fairlawn has just bumped up the meeting. He wants to see you half an hour earlier. What? If you leave there now, you'll just about make it. I'll keep Alan at bay here, but David, by the sounds of things, you don't want to miss this meeting. - Everything okay? - No, actually. I got to get to the meeting now. But what about Charlotte's gift? I guess I'll just have to go with the gift card. Look. I'm so sorry. I can keep looking. I don't mind. No. No, no, no. Honestly. Just-- No. - David-- - Please. - David? - It's fine. David-- Americans. Mr. Fairlawn's office. Yeah. No. This is David Burnside. I have a meeting today with Mr. Fairlawn, but I had a little accident. Well-- Hi. I brought you some hot cider. - Thank you. - And, um... ...some new clothes. - Okay. - Did you get through to him? I did, yes. Turns out he's a busy guy. Yeah. Mr. Fairlawn only had a small window to meet, which vanished as I was taking a swim. Well, can he see you later today? No. He's already left the office. Turns out he has to go to a Christmas party at the Landmark Hotel. What about tomorrow? Tomorrow will be too late. That's exactly what Simon is going to say when I tell him. There has to be something that we could do. We? Yes, we. It's like the gift card thing. I just don't like giving up, that's all. Wait a second. Did you say that Mr. Fairlawn is going to be at Landmark tonight? Mm-hmm. For a charity event. Oh. - I've got an idea. - Uh-huh? Okay. Okay. Well, thanks, anyway. Right. Sorry. It's a private party, and they won't let me add any name to the guest list. Well, it was worth a shot. True. He is awfully handsome. Em, that is not what I meant. Oh, come on. Don't act like you haven't noticed. Maybe I have, maybe I haven't. Either way, this is a strictly business situation. Mm-hmm. Well, it only took me 10 minutes in a hot shower to stop shivering. I must say, you pull off that sweater very well. Really? I thought it was a kind of a joke. Okay. Short notice. So, Emily didn't have much luck with the Landmark. Oh. Um, well, thank you, anyway. Uh-- I guess I'm just going to have to tell my boss that I missed the meeting with Fairlawn, and that will be that. Well, no. Hang on. I just couldn't get your names on the guest list. It doesn't mean I couldn't get you into the party. You're a lifesaver. What? Oh, but you can't go like that. It's a black-tie event. - Do you have a tux? - Uh-huh. In storage, in New York. Oh. But I know where I can borrow one. One olive or two? Let's go three. It's the holidays. Good idea. I swear, how long does it take that boy to put a tux on? David, I expect the party is going to be over by the time you get down. Here you go. At this rate, he's going to miss the party, Christmas, Halloween, Easter, all of them. I'm, uh, having a little trouble with the tie. Do they not teach you anything in American school? Come here. Yep. Well, the pants are a bit long, but thanks for the loaner, guys. Um, I'll get it back to you in the morning. Keep it. Somebody grew out of that one years ago. I told you, the dry cleaner shrunk it. Just around the waist? Ugh. I don't know why I married you. - How did you know? - Know what? Well, that Ethan was, you know, the one. Well, I suppose it was the fact that all the ones before him were such heavy lifting. What do you mean? Well, you know how they say that relationships take hard work. Mm-hmm. With Ethan and I, it never really felt like hard work. It was not always easy, I suppose, but it's always a great deal of fun. Hmm. - David? - Mm-hmm? Is this about Charlotte? No. No, no. "No, no, no." Hey. Charlotte is a very special woman. I'm not saying she isn't. But is she the right kind of special to make her the one for you? Ethan: David, your date is here. It's not a date. It's a date. Ethan, it's strictly bus-- Hi. Hey. You look, uh, very smart. Thanks. You look... ...very smart, too. Anji, uh, this is Ethan. Uh, Callum from work's husband. - Hello. - Ah. - Well, nice to meet you both. - Pleasure. Don't stay out too late, you two, all right? You know how we worry. - Good? - Mm-hmm. Bye. Say. That's not Charlotte. No. No, it isn't. They grow up so quickly, don't they? Yeah. Hey, I don't know about this. What if Fairlawn finds out that I crashed a party just to meet him? David, it's a huge Christmas bash. Mm-hmm? No one's going to notice a couple of extra guests. Besides, you really want this project, don't you? I came all the way across town in a borrowed tuxedo with a woman that I met yesterday. What do you think? Right this way. Just remember, you've never heard of me. If my boss finds out that I've let you in, I'll be back working birthday parties at the Christmas panto. I want all the juicy details. There won't be any juicy details. I told you this is strictly business. No. That does not look like a "strictly business" dress to me. Thank you. So, what does this Mr. Fairlawn look like anyway? Uh, I have no idea. I've never met the guy. All right. Well, if he's so important, he's got to be online, doesn't he? Hmm. Found him. You're sure that's him? Well, there's only one way to find out. Come on. Let's move it around. Why are you doing all this? - You don't like dancing? - No. Giving up your night to help me out. I mean, I'm sure there's other things you'd rather be doing than crashing a fancy party with a complete stranger. Well, I had planned on emptying the bin liners tonight, and then maybe eating the biscuits my Mum sent last week in front of the telly. So, yes. Sacrifice made. I still find it hard to believe that the Gift Whisperer doesn't have someone special of her own. Well, when it comes to finding the perfect gift, I've got it sorted. Turned out to be harder to find the perfect man. David. That's him. Okay. So, how do I do this? Okay. We dance over there. You pretend to recognize him. Introduce me. I'll talk to his wife about Christmas shopping or something, and then suggest that you two go get some drinks. And then, on the way, you pitch your project harder than you've pitched anything in your whole life before. Simple. How on earth do you come up with this stuff? I told you. I'm a professional. Ah. Oh, no. What's wrong? That's my boss and his wife. Wait. Isn't that Charlotte's mother? Yeah. You're dating your boss's-- Charlotte is my boss's daughter, and I'm pretty sure that I told her I was working late tonight. So, we got to get out of here now. Okay. What about Mr. Fairlawn? Uh, maybe I can wait for him outside, and I'll talk to him then, okay? Let's go. - Okay. Wait, wait. - What? It's caught. - What's caught? - My purse. Your pulling is going to make the tree-- Excuse me. David? Charlotte. Great party, huh? Yeah. Charlotte, please. Just let me explain. Everything is perfectly clear to me, David, thank you very much. It's also clear to me that I should've turned down my parents' invitation to this party tonight. It would have saved us all a lot of embarrassment. You? You told me that you were happy to start a new life with me here in London. Yet apparently, you're having a hard time letting go of someone from your past. What? Wait, wait, wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait. Anji is not from my past. No? She's my, uh-- My personal shopper. Come on, David! Now, look. I know how that sounds, but I couldn't find you the perfect Christmas present. So, I hired Anji to do it for me. All right. Then why are you here? Well, that's kind of a long story, but I came here to meet... ...that guy. Charlotte, he's telling the truth. All right. Well, if he is, then I'm going to need just a little bit of time to process this. And if he isn't, then we are going to talk about this later. Our car is here, dear. Good night, David. Good night, Katherine. Simon? Please, just let me try and explain. I spoke to Alan Fairlawn. He says you missed the meeting. Now I suppose I can see why. Mr. Fitzsimmons, it's not what you think. I think I've heard enough for one evening. Thank you. We'll discuss this in the morning, David. My office, 10 AM. Good night. Great. Just great. I lost my girlfriend, a contract, and probably my job, all in one night. She's just angry. I'm sure she'll be fine after a good night's sleep. Oh, a good night's sleep. That's exactly what I need... preferably one that lasts about a year. Isn't this where we parked the car? What the... Battery's dead, and the charger's in the car. I suppose this is good night, then. I am so, so sorry that things didn't work out, David, - I really am. - No. Please don't. Hey, hey, wait, wait, wait. Where are you going? I guess I'm going to the impound lot. I need my car. There are gifts in the boot that I need to give my clients in the morning. Well, I'm coming with you. You are so sweet, but you really don't have to. Yes, I do, and I'm not being sweet. My keys are in my suit, the suit that is in the trunk of your car. Taxi! Come on. Got to be kidding me. - That's the fifth one. - Yes. Whatever happened to the Christmas spirit? I am so, so sorry about this, David. I just-- I can't believe I-- I didn't see the sign! No, no. It's-- Don't worry about it. It's just that, well, usually, I have my whole day planned out for me, and, well, today-- Well, today didn't exactly go to plan. Talking about things unplanned... Let's go. Have you ever heard of the Westminster Christmas Wish? The what? On December 24th, if you toss a coin into the reflection of Big Ben as it chimes midnight, your Christmas wish will come true. Huh. Wait. Did you just make that up? Absolutely not. Good, because come tomorrow night, I'll probably be wishing for a new job. I am sure there are so many companies that would snap you up in a second. Oh, it's easy for you to say. You have a very successful business all of your own. Okay, confession time. I'm really not... very successful. But you're always so busy. I am, mostly catching up. I, uh, I had this business partner who promised me the world. - Mm-hmm. - And then just up and left with all the money. Makes it hard to-- to trust people. But if I'm being very honest, I-- I'm barely breaking even. So, why do you do it? Because I love it, and I love... making people happy. How about you? Are you happy? I'm not unhappy. Uh... Okay. If I was being honest, there are days that I feel like a complete failure, that maybe my parents were right all along and I should just give up and take over the family business when my dad retires just like they want me to. You got nothing to worry about. My dad always used to say that you're only a failure if you give up, and remember, the Gift Whisperer never gives up. Speaking of which, we should, uh-- Yes. Oh, no! - Oh, no! - Ah, come on. - You got to be kidding me. - I mean, I thought places like this are open all night! Ah. Except during the holidays. I just-- We've walked all the way over here for nothing, and my feet are just aching! Mine are so cold I can't feel them. Okay. So, so... what do we do now? The closest tube station is just 10 blocks away. Okay. Or... Or? I know a place. Okay. Uh, are you sure that a pub is the best idea? This isn't just any pub. Anjali, you've come to visit your parents. What a lovely surprise. Mum, I saw you yesterday. Oh, my. Don't you both look handsome. Uh, Mum, this is David. David, this is my mum, Nalini. She and my dad own the Hungry Manchester. - Ah. - But as you can see, I do most of the work. Pleasure to meet you, David. - Oh. Pleasure is all mine. - Although if I'd known my daughter was going to bring a gentleman friend, I would have dressed up a little. Mum, David's a client. Oh. Pity. Who'd like some hot mulled wine? So, you're from New York, David. - Uh-huh. - Do you know, I've always wanted to go there. The nearest we've ever been is Dorset. Dorset was good enough for our honeymoon. I called my friend Devin at the district council, and he says the lot won't be open until tomorrow morning. I can give you a ride home after closing. David won't be able to get into his flat, Dad. His keys are in my boot. Oh, well, we've plenty of room here, David. We live just upstairs, and, um, there's a lovely, big guest suite. Oh, no. No, no, no. I couldn't possibly, but thank you. So, David, you're an architect. - Uh-huh. - Anything I would know? Not in London. Not yet. David's starting his first project in London, Dad. Actually, after tonight, I wouldn't be so sure. Well, you keep at it. Every artist wants to make a mark in this world, and I'll bet you'll make yours, too. Oh, and if you don't have any plans for tomorrow night, David, we're having a big open house with lots of food and good fun with friends and family. - Everyone is welcome. - That's, uh, very kind of you, but actually, I'll be with my girlfriend and her family. - Oh. - We're spending our first Christmas together this year. Your first Christmas? So that means you and your girlfriend have been together - for less than a year. - Mum! What? I'm only making conversation. - Come along, David. - Where are we going? We have an old Christmas tradition here at the Hungry Manchester. - Mum. - Oh. I'm scared. So, did my daughter tell you how she became a personal shopper? Uh, yeah. Something about buying a watch for her, uh, roommate's boyfriend or-- Is that what she said? Yeah. Why? Well, it's not really my place to say. I'm just her mum, but between us-- - Uh-huh? - He wasn't her roommate's boyfriend. He was hers. Really? Yes. They were quite serious, really. At least Anjali thought so. She bought him that beautiful watch as a gift, but he left her for her roommate... on Christmas Eve. - Ouch. - Ouch, indeed. She's never really gotten over it, I think. - Uh-huh. - Funny thing is, she blames the watch. - Really? Why? - Well, between us, I think she feels if she'd bought him the right gift, he wouldn't have left her. Oh, that's ridiculous. Maybe it is. Or maybe it isn't... if you're a girl searching for a reason for a broken heart. So, you want, uh... The perfect gift. Oh. You owe me 10 quid. Old Christmas tradition. Oh, I see. Really? Thank you. Your mother tells me you've changed your mind about taking over the pub when I retire. I didn't change my mind, Dad. You and Mum were the ones who made it up for me - in the first place. - The Hungry Manchester has been in my family for years. It has taken very good care of you, of all of us. It's nothing to be ashamed of. I never said I was ashamed of this place. I love this place. But-- --it's just not mine, okay? I just wish I could make you both understand that. You've been talking about this book and this gift business for years. That's what you want to do with your life? Yes. It is. Look. I want to make you both proud of me. I do. But I just-- I don't want to do it your way. I want to do it on my own. I'll go up and put some fresh towels out for you - in the guest room, David. - No. Honestly, I can get a hotel. Uh, not another word. Anjali, your room's ready, too. Thank you. My room is always ready. She's been expecting me to move back since I went to college. - Ah. - Does the tree topper look crooked to you, my love? It looks perfect, my love, just like every year. See you both in the morning. Good night. I'm so, so sorry about my mum and dad. They can be a bit much sometimes. You kidding me? They're incredible. In the whole time I was with my parents, I don't think I ever saw them kiss each other. It's kind of cute. Mm. You know, he is right. That angel is crooked. You sure? I like it. It's, uh... It's more... like Christmas. Just like Christmas. Uh, so... I've got a big day tomorrow, - lots of gifts to deliver. - Ah. Cutting it kind of close, aren't you? Well, not really, no. People ask me to do it as late as possible so they don't have to hide the presents from little fingers. Aren't these your keys? - They are. - You said that your keys were... in your suit in my car. I did say that. Yeah. But here they are. And yet, here they are. Okay. Well, just, uh, send the bill to my office. Let me know how much I owe you, and, um... Anji... about the keys-- You knew you had the keys all along, didn't you? I couldn't just up and leave you there, alone. That wouldn't have been the right thing to do. I'm sorry. I should have been honest, especially after what you said about not being able to trust people, so... Thank you, David. Really. No! I should be thanking you! Why, after all the things that happened today? I can't remember the last time I had so much fun. What, even with all the Christmas stuff and all the fa-la-las and everything? Even the fa-la-las. Might not have been the day I planned, but it just might have been the day I needed. But we didn't find the perfect Christmas gift. I don't know. Maybe we did. Anyway, um, please thank your mom for the offer of the guest room and the mulled wine, and wish them both all the best for the holidays, hmm? I will. I will. - Thank you. - Oh. Thank you. Hey. - I-- Sorry. - No. I should not have done that. No, no, no. No. No. Everybody gets caught up in the Christmas spirit at least once. Right. The Christmas spirit. Yes. Okay. Well, Merry Christmas, Anji Patel. Happy Christmas, David Burnside. Thanks, man. Hello, David. It's me. It was a very awkward situation this evening. I was very angry, of course, but I feel that we need to discuss where we go from here. So would you please call me back? Thank you. David, it's me again, and you're still not answering. I'm not sure where you are, but when you get this message, please call me. David, it's Charlotte. We need to talk. Call me! Come on, Dad! The lot opens in 10 minutes! - I've got to get there! - The car engine is already running. Come on. Let's go. Thank you, Daddy. Do you know, I still don't understand exactly what happened. So, David did find his keys after all? - Yeah, more or less. - What does that mean, "more or less"? Honestly, Anjali, sometimes, you make no sense. Oh. What's this? "For Nalini and Suresh." It's a gift card, from Carlton's. "Thank you for everything. Merry Christmas. David. PS. To Nalini, I want a rematch." What a sweet thing to do. He seems like a very nice man. It's such a shame that you two couldn't get to know each other better. It can take a lifetime to get to know someone, Mum. Maybe, but sometimes, all it really takes is one day. Why didn't you just tell me who she was in the first place? I didn't want you to think that I didn't know what to get you for Christmas and that I didn't care about you, because I do. I'm just... I'm not sure it's the way you deserve. Please, Char. I didn't mean to hurt you. Funny thing is, you didn't. No, it's true. I got home last night, and I was upset, and I was angry. But I wasn't hurt. Then I realized why I wasn't hurt. If I'm being completely honest, I don't think that our relationship's working. You're so focused on your career right now, and there doesn't seem to be any time for me. And I don't want to compete with a 50-storey building. So, I guess the next step in our relationship is... goodbye? You know how people say they've found the right one? It's not me, is it? No. It's not me, either. So, which one of us is going to tell your dad? My father has his business. I have my life. I don't know what his plans are, but it's between you two to decide. As for Christmas, uh, here. I thought I'd give you this now. It'll save you having to come later tonight.

Please, before you begin, let me say something in my defense. I really did try and get to that meeting yesterday with Fairlawn. - Mm. - But I hadn't had time to get a Christmas present for Charlotte. So... Well, if I told you what happened, you wouldn't believe me, anyway, so let's just say that life got in the way. - Life? - Yes, and I guess I wasn't prepared for it, because I have been so busy and caught up in work to even have a life. And, well, if you can't have a life at Christmas... Anyway, look. If Fairlawn doesn't understand that, then maybe I wasn't the right guy for him in the first place. I see. Well, uh, David Burnside, I'd like you to meet Alan Fairlawn. Good morning. Alan was kind enough to stop in on his way to Heathrow, to meet you. - Hey. - So, David, let's see what you have. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What? What-- what-- what did you say? Oh, what could I say? I pitched the project, wished them a Merry Christmas, and left. Callum: Oh, my goodness! That is absolutely brilliant! Oh, I wish I'd have seen Simon's face, David. Oh, trust me. He wasn't too happy. Actually, he didn't say much of anything, other than "goodbye." Well, it's either the end of your career or the bravest thing I've ever heard, really. Well, if, you know, success means I have to only concentrate on work and not have a life, then maybe I need to fail once in a while. Oh. Well done, David. I'm proud of you. So, what now? Right now, I got a Christmas delivery to make. Excuse me. Can you do me a favor? I want to surprise my friend. Can you put this with all the other presents? I'm just saying you should call him and wish him happy Christmas. Mum, I told you, he has a girlfriend. Alright, alright, but I know what I saw when I watched you two together. It's just not meant to be. That is all. Thanks, Dad. Uh-huh. Besides, it is Christmas, so-- Here you go. Why don't we just go spread some cheer? Okay. ♪ Yeah, yeah ♪ ♪ Oh ♪ ♪ Well, you're not alone ♪ ♪ Because whenever we're together ♪ ♪ Oh, every day's a holiday ♪ Wow. Great party, Callum.

David, make sure you get some of that caviar before the horde finishes it off. I swear, it's as if they don't eat all year long and then come Christmas Eve they descend upon us like a swarm of locusts. Hey, it's a great party. - Thank you. - Thanks for the invite. I appreciate it. So, you split up with Charlotte. - Uh, yeah. - Oh, my goodness. What happened? Was it anything in particular? Uh, for one thing, I didn't know what to get her for Christmas. What about your friend from last night? She was absolutely charming. Oh, she is. Yeah. Here's the chap I was talking about. David, this is Deirdre. - Deirdre, David. - Oh. Hello. Nice to meet you. Uh, nice to meet you, too. Hey. David is an architect. Oh, really? I'm a Sagittarius. Great. Um... ♪ Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh ♪ ♪ Oh, it's a miracle ♪ ♪ At Christmas ♪ ♪ Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh ♪ ♪ Oh, it's a miracle at Christmas ♪ Did you find it yet? The Christmas coin! Whoo-hoo! - Oh! - Oh, Mum! What a great party! - Thanks to your help. - Mm. You know, you could make a real success of this pub. Oh, Mum, not tonight. Let me finish. The thing is, I believe you could make a real success of anything you put your hand to. Your mother and I have been talking, and, well, we think we owe you an apology. We've been trying to make you live your life for us, not for yourself, and... that was wrong. And we're sorry. - That's okay. - No, it's not. As parents, the most important thing to us-- more important than career, money, or success-- is that our child be happy. And if your happiness means being the Gift Whisperer, well, then, you just be the best darned Gift Whisperer there is, okay? We love you very much, Anji. Oh! Oh, hey. I love you both so much, too. Oh, I almost forgot my Santa duties. - Thanks, Mum. - You're welcome, darling. You guys didn't have to get me anything. It's not from us. Okay. Someone dropped it off for you earlier. "To be used when you sign the publishing contract for your book. I hope you write a happy ending. You deserve it. Happy Christmas. David." So, you still think it's not meant to be? Hey, we're almost out of cheese. I told you we should've bought our own cow. David, can you get that? Hello, David. Simon. Um... come on in. I'll tell Callum that you're here. Actually, I'm here to see you. Oh. Um... I'm surprised you're even talking to me. So am I. We got the contract! - What? - Yeah! Fairlawn was impressed with you. - Really? - Mm. He also liked what you were saying about trying to balance life and work. He said he wants to be in business with someone like you. Well... Well, it's great news, right? He wants to break ground as soon as possible, so we'll, uh-- Well, we'll start working on the project - first thing in the new year. - Okay. Anyway, I, uh... I wanted to let you know... in person. Congratulations. Uh, how'd you know where to find me? Oh. Yes. Uh, well, um, uh, when, uh, Charlotte said that we wouldn't be seeing you at our house tonight, I figured you had to be going to a much better party. Mm. Merry Christmas, David. Thanks, Simon. Have fun. To a happy Christmas, one and all! Cheers! Alright. Who's next for a Christmas toast? - Anybody? - How about you, Anji? Do you have any wonderful toasts for our guests? Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Come on! - Yes, you do! - Come on! - Come on! Don't be shy. - Come on, darling. Okay. Okay. For those of you who don't know what I do for a living, I, um... I help people shop. And she's very good at it, too. Thanks, Dad. I have spent the last 24 hours trying to find the perfect gift. And you know, the thing is, I always thought that that meant something different for everyone. But actually, I don't think that's true anymore. I think maybe the perfect gift is the same thing for all of us. Yeah. A one-size-fits-all gift that keeps giving. And it's not something that you can find on a shelf or even in a store window or even under the tree on Christmas morning... because it is right here. I see it... on your faces. I see it in your eyes. I see it in the way my mum and dad look at me. I see it in the way they look at each other every day, even after all of these years together. So, let us raise a glass to the perfect gift, to love. To love. Happy Christmas, Anji. Thank you. - Thanks, guys. - Bye. Bye, David. Come on. Hi. Hi. They do say London's a small town. Eh. You here to make a wish? I am. And you? I thought that you were spending Christmas Eve with Charlotte and her family. Yeah. That, uh, didn't exactly go to plan. You know, it was a little like your Venn diagram, but Charlotte and I never really did meet in the middle. Thank you for the pen. I love it. Wasn't hard to find you the perfect gift. Maybe that says something. What should we do now? On three? One. Two. Three. I hope they come true. I have a feeling they already have. So, do you have any plans for Christmas Day? What do you have in mind? Mm. Well... I know a place. - Uh-huh. - Now, it's, uh-- I do need to warn you, it's going to be very, very loud, and there are lots of kids running around. And you may have to fight for the cranberry sauce. Ah. Cranberry sauce. Sounds like a jolly good Christmas to me. Cranberry sauce. Mmm, mmm. - Yummy. - Yummy. Very American, actually. Right?
