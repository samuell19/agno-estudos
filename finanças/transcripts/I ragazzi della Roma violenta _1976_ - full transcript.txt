Kills, stabs and shoots at the Police Pursuit in a hail of machinegun fire - Robbers wounded I'm sorry to disturb; may I? We're doing a report on juvenile delinquency... do you have any opinions on the subject? - Opinions? Well, nothing certain... This delinquency is getting worse everyday. - You're a teacher? -Yes. What's your rapport like with the youngsters? - Until now I can't say I've had any problems... ...I've been fortunate, with the classes I've had. The kids are more alert than they once were. "Give me Susanna, or I'll kill everyone" Shall I take off the hat? - No, it's not important... ...we're doing a report on juvenile delinquency, do you have any opinions on the subject? What opinion could I have? - You must have an idea of how to resolve it? It's for the government to think about. What? You want me to think about it? They should be a bit more on the pulse... - The authorities? - Yes. The laws are too vague... ...then all these terrible things wouldn't happen. - At a certain point we saw... It's like that, they do what they want to do... Re-introduce the death penalty. Do you think that would resolve the problem? - Yes, nowadays they go to prison for 2-3 months... ...come out, and carry on exactly as they were before. She opposed the bandits. The jeweller's widow: killed Any ideas about how to resolve the problem? - No, it's reached a point now where I won't go out. Why do say you won't go out? Youngsters today don't want to do anything; few of them are in work. Two armed robberies What would you do to resolve this problem? - I'd kill them all! Those kids who killed... Cicceo... What can you do? Subject to unbelievable violence by a group of well-bred youngsters We can kill them, that's it. Remove them from circulation. Meanwhile, Marina has been held prisoner for twelve days Do you have any opinion on this? I don't really know what our opinion is. I say to scare them, use the death penalty... Yes, the death penalty. - ...because I think everybody values life. Look, I'll tell you, I have two kids, so I know very well... Narcotizzata kidnapped - daughter of concrete magnate ...it's terrible. Watching TV I am shocked. That boy that was killed, it was atrocious. I think a lot about the future, especially for the children. Convict killed in a meadow - head smashed with a brick. Excuse me, Sir. We're doing a report on juvenile delinquency. You're reading a newspaper... it's 'The Black Chronicle'? - Yes. For a while I've been noticing an explosion of this phenomena of violence against ourselves. I've talked about this with the kids at school. - You're a teacher? Yes, I teach in a college nearby. I've noticed that youngsters have this desire to mix with the 'mala' (bad) amongst them. Teacher, how can we resolve this problem? - We need to get a firmer grip. In what way? - The authorities, tougher laws and the Magistrates... ...shouldn't function as weakly as they do. I understand they have a lot of work to do, but... ...it happens that people commit serious crimes and then get released six months later. The Kids of Violent Rome Great - guys, what was I saying? - For me that was phenomenal. I'm not so convinced; this 'salami' couldn't even do anything with me, and I did try. To touch! Touch to believe! What are you doing, Gianna? - Marco told her to touch, so she touches. Hey! He really did enjoy it. Attention! We've had news from Ponte (Bridge) Certa that one of our own has betrayed us. He's betrayed us by fraternising with a girl from Tuscolano in secret. Above all, that whore is from a communist family. - Communist? Then it's Enrico? - It's him! - There's no doubt. Yes, it's him. One of the founders of our group, and one of my closest friends. We'll start on the fifth floor. We'll put the second group into action. Good, now you may leave. We'll let you know the time and date of the next reunion. But remember, all of you must come. A variation to the system is opportune. If Dido has to follow Enrico, it's better if I go too. If we appear as a couple it'll be less obvious. - Then you can also screw Dido, right? Why not? He's the only one I haven't. - Look, Gianna: you're beautiful and exciting... but that pinball machine is something else. It gives me such a strong sensation! In that case I'll wear lights, bells and buttons! - Enough! Tomorrow, start following Enrico. She must be the dirty whore. - And that idiot is waiting for her. I hope they don't waste too much of our time. - Right. How long can you stay, my love? - As long as you want. Well, we've identified the whore. Do we still need to follow them? Certainly, at least you'll learn something. - Rubbish, we're just spying on them screwing. Where are they going? - Via Delle Fratte 69, Interno 23. Those two are going to have a little fun. - Wait a bit and we'll follow them. Squalid, isn't it? - Why? Actually, I find it quite exciting. Exciting? - Of course. Now that we've the pill we can do it when we like, we don't have any style anymore. Look, it's different. It's much better. - Could be? Keep quiet, or I'll smash your face in! You'll do it, understood? - Yes. - Or I'll cut your throat! Dirty pigs! You can only get away with this because there are three of you. Bastards! Don't say that! We'll all have you! Understand? - Pigs! I'll make you pay for this. Shut it! Let me see those legs. Pigs! Pigs! Take off her pants. - Tear them off, fool! Wonderful, these three worms are the perfect instrument. Think about it! It's so good. Fabulous... simply fabulous. Useless shit! If I relied on you, I'd be dead. - But you liked it? What are you waiting for? I'm waiting for permission from the person who has their foot on my jacket. Can I, Miss? - All I see is a stone covered in shit. Shit? Did they hurt you? I meant with their punches? - You really don't understand women... it's violence which excites us to our limits. - Bullshit! Getting raped for pleasure? Don't you attack the pinball machine? They're male, so it's a homosexual gesture. I'm a homosexual? What the hell are you talking about? Pinball machines are feminine machines, so it's heterosexual sex. Where are you going? - You want to stay to take notes? You can if you want. If there was a pinball machine... Hey, what about Enrico and her? They've gone. Let's go and see Marco. I don't care if you enjoyed it, it's respect that counts. It's evident that Enrico and his woman are hanging around that area... whilst you..? No. That scum, Schizo, is going to pay. - Schizo, who's he? The guy you met in prison? Yes, he took the packages sent from home. I also defended him against the other guys. You believe in friendship with these people? - To hell with friendship. When I got my packages I started an investment that, at some point, I'd be able to collect. It seems like I was wrong. And now I have to sort this out. It's Garrofarro. Didn't he tell you to stay still and do nothing? To behave...? What, and let her get away? She was too good! - But you had orders not to touch the Pariollini. When does he ever follow orders? - I obey leaders, not those locked up for 2 years. Know what I say? Understand me clearly on this: She really enjoyed it! ...and not just a little bit! Did you go and explore her caverns? - In short, did you sodomise her or not? I came inside her... twice! What're you saying, 'sodimised'? I dunno. Look, we wanna know if you banged her where the sun don't shine, understood? Ah! You're asking me if I turned the other page? No, I don't like pork. What d'ya mean, pork? She's still a woman! Besides, today it's in fashion. Pegori, cut the cards and let's play. - Yes, let's play; it's better. Pork meat? Women?! Are you gonna stop busting my balls with all this bullshit? What'll I do with this? - Throw it away. You, Gorilla, get some reinforcements. When Marco finds out, this'll be on your head. That Pariollini shit you're talking about is after you as well! Nobody escapes Gorilla. Not even that fascist scum! You're the fascist, shithead! - God damn! These sons-of-bitches never die. Marco, how are you? I'm furious! Who was it? - My men are free. Yes, they respect me... ...but if they want to do something, they do it. - Don't keep him waiting, tell faggot Pariollino. Fascist, shithead! It was me. Was it him? -Yes. I told you to be prepared! I'll take care of you. - Come on then. - I'll break you! Fascist! Stop him or he'll kill him. - Who cares? Who cares?! Get him off. Let go of me! Let go of me! I've calmed down! - Damn! Marco... You really are a beast. What'll we do with Gorilla? - Get him out of here. Where the hell do we put him? - Throw him out with the rubbish. Can you tell me why you got so upset when that prick Gorilla called you a fascist? Who the hell are you? - Me? I'm Nerone. I really like fire! Marco, let's get together? Bring the table. Nerone? Did you know he (Emperor Nero) didn't like the elderly, the disabled, jews, blacks... - Damn! That old fool didn't like anyone, did he? - He wanted the world to be made up of 'perfect beings'. The chosen ones would rule, and the rest would become their slaves. Sounds like Hitler to me. - Exactly! I cannot be a fascist... ...because fascism is just pseudo-socialism. And Mussolini? Mussolini was a fool who was killed like a dog. Right, and Hitler? - He died like a man! If the Americans had got it right... ...they'd never have entered the war, and today Russia would be where it deserves: in the shit. You're a Nazi then? - National Socialist, or as you call it, a Nazi. I thought fascists were compatriots. - D'you think Hitler could've held it together? Dunno. But all this talk has made me hungry. We need some sandwiches. Now that is a good idea. Who's going? Secco or Pecchorino? I don't really care. Where I go, they catch me. - Me too. You're thinking of stealing some sandwiches? I can understand stealing money to buy sandwiches... Don't you see that it's the same to rob a baker as it is to rob a bank? Here. Buy beer, wine and bread, for everyone. - I want ham in my sandwich. Now we need to think about that bitch who is screwing Enrico... You're Franca, right? - Yes, but Enrico? He couldn't make it because he had things to do; he had to go shopping with his mother. He entrusted me to come and get you and bring you back to our refuge; it's a lovely place. Okay, but I need to be back early. I always go home with my brother. Okay. Enrico! - Do as I say; it's very dangerous. But why? What's going on? - Don't ask questions, I beg you. We are reunited here to put on trial the leader of our group, Enrico Ferrini. Enrico Ferrini: guilty or innocent? - Guilty of violating article 6 of the general rules... and article 11 of the complimentary regulations. With the gravity of the charges accounted for. Precise, as usual, good. You don't forget a thing. Choose your punishment, active or passive? I remind you that the active punishment... You forget that it was I who wrote these regulations in Germany. The punishment is doubled... ...and I choose the whip: the maximum quotient of pain. Dirty bitch whore! Now Enrico will increase his punishment in order to save your pale skin! -But... - Silence! The culprit may self-adjudicate. He may only speak at the request of the leader. Good, an authoritative explanation. Proceed... Enough. Team leader Enrico Ferrini is dissolved of any blame. Proceed with the accomplice. Are we leaving now? - No, now we must continue. Do as I say! You must undress... You must! What do we have to do? Make love in front of everyone? - Yes, but... - But not with him. Take her. It's over. They've all gone: it's just us two. No... even you have gone away. Quiet... If you scream I'll break your neck. You're ours now! You have to do it with us, whenever we want, understood? You're either with us... or with them. A show of strength. There... that's what we need. A revolution. We could start by burning down the schools? - Rubbish! Talking of schools... it seems like Enrico's changed; he's going away. - He left because we dealt with his little whore. She really enjoyed it! - I don't think she felt a thing... didn't you see? With Lino she was like a corpse? - Who is talking about Lino? I had her yesterday... ...and I assure you she went like a cannon! I enjoyed being taken by force... She's a real woman, and now she's ours. I am like them; a savage animal. I wait for Marco to call me, but I mustn't. I must go far away, where he can't get me. 'Far away... Far away.' People fail if they haven't got balls. In my day it was different... ...whoever had them commanded. Today it's all a stinking mess. And you? You haven't learnt a thing. You think you're a boss, with those four idiots following you? What have you achieved? You've done a robbery, and all that brought was a charge... You know what it cost to get you out of that? Yet you continue to ask me for money! Not only you! The cooks, the operators, They all want cash, then it runs out... ...and you pay in change. Invest 10,000,000 lira and you can hire the right people to organise a decent kidnapping. Today, ransoms are fetching over a million. - You're 18 years old and all I hear is bullshit! My grandfather was right; give them a kick up the arse. If they get upset then kick them some more! "In those days I'd have have started a factory just for kicks, and no doubt I'd have made a profit." Given that you're so mean to me, the only option left is to organise my own kidnapping. Would you pay a million for my skin? He's gone... Son of a bitch! Mother? Mother? Mother, I need money. - Marco... I don't understand? Money! - Don't shout, dear. You'll make yourself sick. Take what you want. Marco, my boy, eat up! - Yes, mother, I'm eating. Let's see what they've prepared today? What a pain! Fillet. The more I hate it, the more they give me. I'll give it to the dog. Bruschino? Bruschino, here you are: eat. In my village we come prepared. "If you don't prepare - you don't eat." Bloody hell. This is my house, you know. - When you get out there and work... ...for now you just eat bread and rip people off. - I'll go eat elsewhere, then I'll come back. I'll throw out all of my poor father's things. Understood? But your father died when he discovered someone was sleeping with his wife. You go to hell! Listen, to begin with you can take away these flowers. Take them to the cemetery... Let's see... this isn't needed. Bring me some tortellini... No! ravioli with ricotta... No! Is it Thursday today? We must eat gnocchi. A nice big plate! No... I'm getting fat. Bring me some ham and melon... Listen, the ham must be very thin or I'll send it back. Go on! Good morning, madam. - Good morning. Is Luciano home? No, he's at work. He told me I could borrow his harpoon. - Well, I can still get it for you, can't I? Thanks. - It was nothing. Hey...! Now you're attacking chickens. Isn't it easier to just get a job? If I stabbed you I'd get a prize for killing a vagrant! If you want a chicken... ...come in and choose one. Want one? - With the hunger that I've got, of course I do. But you're my son! I'm your parent, and so I have to give you something? In that case, speak up! Do you want me to stab you, or do you want a chicken? I want your sister tonight, before she starts. - My sister? Isn't she a whore? - Okay, okay. Give me the chicken. Remember, I want to be the first of the evening, because I want her clean! What do you want? - Friends sent me. Go to the bar and wait. Goodbye. Anna, will you do this for me? - Speak to my manager. What did you say? Your manager?! And why can't I have a manager? Those whore actresses have them. Can't someone keep a whore who's a slut? - Okay, I'll speak to this manager; who is he? What do you mean 'who is he'? He's my fiance. - That dirty scum Santino? I'm your brother! My brother! My brother! You only think of me when you need something. Speak to Santino. No way! I won't see that fool. If I see him, he'll stab me and I'll end up in hospital. I repeat: If I see him I'll get stabbed, and that'll be on your conscience. No! I won't go to that fool, understood? He's a bloody fool. - Goodbye. So, will you do me this favour? - I didn't hear you. I said, will you do me this favour? Damn it, this music is for the deaf. Why did you turn it off? - I didn't. I just turned it down. What? - I didn't turn it off, I just turned it down. A pleasure! Kappa unit, eighty combatants. - A pleasure, Schizo. Santino, will you do me this favour? - See? He's a beast! He was in 36 Kappa unit. That's why he's messed up, Y'know what he did?. - You haven't understood, he was left standing. Santi', I don't care, will you do me this favour? - I promised her a nightdress, Get it and I'll- But how can I do that? - That's your problem! I help you, you help me! Bring me a nightdress and it's done. Size 44. Remember, a delicate colour, like your sister. Okay, I understand. First that cook, now this idiot. Run, Schizo, get your sister! Run, Schizo, get a nightdress. "A delicate colour!" Whores get called many things, but 'delicate' isn't one of them. Right! Happy holidays for that idiot, Schizo. Where can I find a delicate nightdress? Maybe... Let's have a good look.. This could be the one. Hey? looking for a nightdress for Merletto? - Shut it! I was asked to get a 'delicate' one. I understand, like a whore's? Look, this place is no good, I know a place with certain boutiques. Come on, how do you want it? You decide. Size 44, in a 'delicate' colour. - Okay, I'll deal with it. Wait at the base. Nerone landed on my plate like a spoonful of macaroni! Yes, it's the right place. It's so far away, these people won't recognise you at all. ...what do you want me to say? That our clients prefer more refinement? I can't permit this. Can I help you, Sir? - Just looking around. What a big shop this is. You've got everything. It must have cost a lot? Do you earn a lot? Listen, if you want something, tell me. Otherwise, please leave. It's always the same! Just because I'm poor you throw me out like a dog! It's not right. I haven't hurt or upset anyone, have I madam? - It's true. Well... I... - Get out, or I'll call the Police. Then I'll kill myself! I want to die. I'll kill myself! I'll cut myself everywhere. Could you please kill yourself somewhere else! - What's he doing?! There's blood! Do something. Okay... take this. Get some medicine. - I saw a nice nightdress... it might be useful. Miss, give him what he wants. - I didn't ask, but you're so kind I can't refuse... You're such a dear! Now, be a good girl. - The chef? - Start with him. A man of honour must always keep his word. Good evening. - Good evening, Mr. Marco. Yes? Mr. Marco, it's for you. Hello? Yes, it's me. - There's a Professor, Mario Rossi, an anarchist... he's been causing trouble. You need to teach him a small lesson. How small? - You decide. He'll be at Piazza Giabutti, near the end of Via Dante. Be careful not to be noticed. Don't worry. Your package will be delivered soon. Good evening. - Good evening, Mr Marco. Good evening, Professor. - Good evening. - Good evening. Good evening. - Good evening. You're my students , right? - No, professor, we have a problem... ...our parents don't understand and we... - Yes, let's discuss; speak freely. Our friend is in a difficult situation. If he tells us what he knows he could be killed. Do you understand, professor? - But, that's absurd. Unfortunately, that's the case. If you knew you could die with the information you had, what would you do? Still ask for help? I hate violence, what can I say? I'm against it. - Would you retaliate? No, I really don't think so. - No, he wouldn't. He'd keep quiet; he's a villain. If you shout we'll kill you. Understand, you pathetic anarchist?! He seems so relaxed it's making me mad. Anarchy is bullshit, isn't that right Professor? - Anarchy really is....bullshit! Someone said that you, Professor Rossi Giuseppe, claim to be an anarchist. Is this true? Yes or no? You were. Now, our dear professor of shit isn't an anarchist anymore. You spit on anarchy, don't you? I spit on anarchy! - Dry your face. Throw it away. Thank you. Permit me to tell you: you are very beautiful, and sweet, with sensitive hands; like an artist. What beautiful hands you have. You're an artist. A woman's hands have hit where it counts. Take your clothes off. - No. When I find a real man, I have fun. I give them everything, understand? Who knows if he functions like a man? - Ask him at the next toast. Understood? Throw your damned leaflets in the toilet, and stop spreading that bullshit. Dear God, stop! I can't take anymore. Don't move. What did we really do to that piece of shit? We squeezed his balls and that's it. Deep down he really got away with it. - He's just a poor old guy. Remember, we mustn't exaggerate in this life. - Look, he's over there! Strange! The more I hurt you, the more you like it. I don't feel a thing. - But you're a good friend. You're so stupid, Schizo... I made 100,000 lira. If I go back to that shop I'm sure to make another 100,000 lira. Wake up! What are you? A vampire? - Don't talk rubbish. A name change may be good? Herr. Vampire? I prefer 'Nerone', it's more rapid, more precise. If you don't do as I say, I'll burn you! I've told everyone. Make yourselves at home. Pay attention, because this show deserves it. - Look, Dido, it's all yours. What is it? - Can't you see? It's a pinball machine... ...it's a bit special, like an Easter egg. Do you like your surprise? Come on, what are you waiting for? Now it's a complete pinball machine, don't you see? Hi, guys. Hi, Marco. Enrico was looking for you, so I brought him here. Hi, Enrico, how are you? - Here, read it. "A young life destroyed, an 18 year old woman committed suicide by throwing herself under a train." Where's the tragedy? An idiot kills herself and you come here hassling me with a face like that. You're so sick it makes my hair stands on end. You missed out the name of the victim. It was Franca! Franca Parisi. Understand, murderer? I'm leaving Italy; my father was right. If you stay here you'll soon see what he's capable of! I hope you die like a dog! You don't deserve any less. I need to finish off some homework. - Me too. What shall we do..? Goodbye, Marco. Idiot! She killed herself because she was stupid, and he blames me? He's lucky I didn't beat him up. Did he deserve a good pasting? - I would've, but some people are best left alone. We need to move a little, always the same faces, always the same things... ...we need to innovate, what do you guys think? - I think I could be onto something... I gave two girls a lift home the other day, cute! Both around 18 years old; they looked easy going. You cultivate them, and we'll see what comes of it. Do things calmly; don't scare them. Continue to see them for just a few minutes each day, without going to known places. It's best if you meet them by chance, in parks or by a bar getting an ice-cream. Remember: women are curious, so they need to land in your hands like ripe pears. In the meantime, I've thought of something fun that we can do: a robbery... we'll rob the bar of someone I know. This guy is someone who doesn't trust banks. - Great, I think I know the bar you mean. It's one that takes in quite a lot of business. - Right, he takes at least two million a day. So, tonight he should have at least six... six and a half million lira. Here it is. West... East... It must be there. There it is. Of course it's there. - How did you know it was there? They had to ask my father for permission to knock a hole in the wall. Then they'll find us straight away! - Not if we cover our tracks. Dido, go upstairs and keep watch, and make sure nobody sees you! Certainly captain, don't worry captain, I salute you captain. I'll keep watch. Hey, what are you doing? Thief! Thief! Thief, stop! Come on, we can do it. Get out of here - the Police! - Damn it! Now what? Halt. Pull over. Good evening. License and I.D. License, I.D, insurance is paid. A routine stop? - Yes, Sir. We've been to see a film. One of those films about violence; it was rubbish. They're all bullshit. Tomorrow morning we've got to do a talk about it. - Your Professor sends you to watch those films? You know, it's a new system. He looks at the comments we make and decides how mature we are. You can go, guys. Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. I don't understand a thing. I do it this way and yours comes out that way. Listen, let's do it again. Who is it? - It's me. This lunatic almost had you arrested because of a pinball machine! - Why? The newspaper states that a guard foiled the crime because one of the criminals was playing pinball, and he saw them. - Pinball! Do you remember the film 'The Asphalt Jungle'? Do you remember? That old film we saw last year? - Precisely... The professor, the mastermind, is caught because he is looking at the legs of a girl dancing by the jukebox. Fantastic! While we were sweating with the safe, he was fucking the pinball machine! What are you laughing at? Fool! This ham is nice; cut me a slice. What a smell! Let's do something; I'll close my eyes and you put a slice delicately in my mouth... You idiot! Cut me another slice. - Like hell. I work and you eat... ...I'm called 'Nerone', not 'idiot'. - Okay. Okay. Since you stole that guitar you've been making a racket like that all night. At least Pecchorino stole this lot so we could eat. You could've stolen a plane? You could fly away. Listen, tell me about that girl. - She's nice. To die for. I want to know everything, understood? Everything. What time she leaves work, who she meets, what bus she takes, you follow her... ...and write it all down. I want a full report. 18:00 - she leaves work and boards the 509, alone. You, Pecchorino , follow the boyfriend... ...the one who screws her. You write it all down as well. Write it down? Yeah I can do that. But follow them? No, I need some wheels. There she is, punctual as always. 18:00, she leaves work and gets on the bus. She goes off with that guy who's gonna screw her. What great investigators we've become. Third encounter, 18:02. The average time is 18:00 Ah, here's Pecchorino with his piece of junk bike. If it was any bigger he could give me a lift. She walks alone, with us behind. On foot we couldn't have followed them. Hey! Look at that. Nice! - Nice?! It's no woman, it's the lastest model... Go and have a look without getting noticed. - It's just like the one I saw in the newspaper. It's a Suzuki 750, with a water cooling system. It's got three cylinders. Hey, shall we take it? If you don't, why do they call you Secco? Come on. My motorbike! Stop! What are you doing? Let's go to the bar. - A nice Coca-Cola is needed! Okay. - Here we are. - Nice and with ice! Yes, dear Nino, this time you've chosen well, they are two beautiful little beasts... ...and they're also mature. Shall we play on the pinball machine? - Yes. Put a group song on. Come on! - Do you like this one? - No. Do you like it? - Yes. Pinball is great, do you play? - Yes, but not often. Damn, it went down the hole. You're good. - This music is great, no? Excuse me girls, it's late, I've got to go home. So, we'll meet on Saturday, okay? - Okay. He's nice, isn't he? - Yes, he's not like the others... ...they don't even know you and they jump on you. - Like wolves. Let's go. Come on handsome, this time we'll give you a hiding. The more I polish this bike, the more I like it. Yes, I understand. Giorgio is off to see his beautful woman. That Giorgio, as my father would say, is someone who has ambition in life. Where the hell are those idiots? I get it, Pecchorino stole a bike and he's testing it out. I don't care about cars and bikes, I told them to be here, so they should be here. Hey, why are you taking it out on me? Here they are. It's amazing! - For me these things don't exist... I get to where I need to go, and I don't care how I do it. Who cares? - Here, give this to the big boss. Wait, Schizo. Pecchorino and I have been wondering about something... I'm going to talk to him. Keep an eye on the bike; they steal them around these parts. Get going. So, we've been investigators like in those American TV shows. That Giorgio... What is he carrying in that suitcase? Lots of money? Jewellery? Or is it state secrets? Error! Big error! Whatever action we take needs to be studied scientifically, understood? No! What are we going to do to them two? - What a hothead! It's her... It's her! Shit! All this time you've made us waste. We follow, then steal what he's got and it's done. Pecchorino is right. No, Nino, tomorrow is fine, but don't scare them. Meet at 4, no later. Don't talk about anywhere far away. Tell them only that it's a beach party, I don't know? Torvaianica. Okay? Goodbye. "He manages to unlock the door and opens it slowly, and sees a woman sleeping in the bed... The woman gets up and walks to the bathroom... She runs a bath, then the woman puts on her robe. She has an incredible body. She walks towards... She is unable to stop the violent desires that have taken over her, and he jumps on her... He can feel her beautiful body spasming... Her mortal agony squeezed out..." What a fuck! What a fuck! Yes? - Marco, my little boy, why don't you come home? Have you eaten? Do you want me to prepare you something nice? You're such a pain! I haven't eaten and I'm not hungry! I'll come home when I want. Do you like the sea? - Yes, a lot. I also like to go on boats. If it wasn't so rough we'd go on my father's yacht. - We can always do it another time. Next week? - I'm there! Are we far? - We're here; it's the next villa on the beach. Please, this way. Where are the others? - They should arrive soon; it's just gone five. You know we have to be back by eight? - With Marco driving, we'll be back in an hour. Marco! Look, fish! - Goldfish. I'm going to choose some tunes. Shall we go as well? - Let's go. You'll get us home on time, right? - Of course. I'm sorry, I can't relax. I'm scared of my parents; they're so severe. Are yours? I don't have these problems. - Lucky you. We never get a moment's peace. We can never stay out for the whole day, we can never do those things we shouldn't. You... you've done those things, haven't you? - No... not all of them. While we're waiting, let's dance? - Okay. Take off your sweater. You're beautiful, you know. Turn off that shit! Dido, change it. We could do with a pinball machine here. - Yes, he prefers pinball to women. To play with? - No, no. To make love to. It's abnormal desire. That's absurd! Why doesn't he see a doctor? - Why? Because he's sick; he's not normal. - I don't think so. Actually, he's a lot of fun. I like you. - Dido, bring us a whiskey. Yes boss, here's your favourite scotch, boss. Ladies first. Thank you. Do you two want one? - No thanks, you? - No. I don't feel so well, maybe it's better if we head back to Rome? Let's go. - Excuse me. Leave her alone! Leave her alone! Enough, I've done everything you wanted. - Then what are you waiting for? I've suffered a lot. I don't like pain, do you understand? I understand. This is a pinball machine made of flesh. Let go of me! If you keep screaming I'll break your neck, understood? Good girl, is there something you wanna see? Then you won't miss a thing! Right, because holes can't be seen. Children go around dressed... Come on, play. Play! 'Dree' - Say 'dree'. If you don't, he'll continue! 'Dree!' - More! 'Dree!' ...'Dree!' ....'Dree!' Be good and let him take off your trousers. - Yes! Let's get these off. Take her, Dido. I can't do it. Pinball! Where d'you think you're going? He hasn't done anything to you. Come on. You're crazy! What have you done? - Love and death. Love and death. The perfect symbiosis. Death of the weak, for the love of the strong. The strong will live forever... forever! I had my turn. - Wake up, and start playing. Hey, Schizo, your friends are in the newspaper. - In the newspaper? What have they done? It's bad; one of them's dead and the other almost. - How did she die? - They did her in. Didn't your friend only go after gays? - Jesus Christ! In the newspaper? I'm not happy about this. - Isn't he your friend? Like hell are they my friends! What are we, stupid? What day is it today? - Wednesday. Tuesday... Wednesday, they're on the lawn, let's go. They'll be there, don't worry. Let's get out of here. Hurry... accelerate! I'm scared! - Don't worry, they won't get us. What are you doing? Have you gone crazy? Stop it! Stop it! Let's go get some stones and rocks! What have we done to you..? No! Let go of me! Look! Look, at what they're doing to him. Giorgio! No! Have a good look! Okay... Enough, enough. Put him in the boot. Let go of me! Come here. Nice! Marco, you might be a beast, but we don't mess around either. We aren't like him, he killed someone. - Hey! We're respected, not infamous. Then I was right, he's infamous then. - He's rich, with money he buys what he wants. They arrest him and he goes into a clinic, they arrest one of us and they throw away the key. Marco! You're a force! Marco, we'll do everything you do. ...the atrocious crime committed by three youths. Marco Garroni, son of the industrialist Garroni... is accused of killing Marina Bonni.
