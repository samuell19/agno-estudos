Let's have a drink. Huh? Let's have a drink at my pad. What for, we're okay here, aren't we? It's too crowded in here and the heat's going to my head. My bike's right outside. You make it sound appealing. It is. What do you say? I wouldn't mind going for a ride. Let's go, huh? Okay. Let me go get my bag. Hey, wait. I'm coming along. Hey, we're waiting outside. All right. We've got it made. What? We've got it made! It looks like it. We're pretty damn well irresistible. That's why. Well, are you coming? In a way, I like this one here better. You wanna work or build yourself a hole? Well, it's not my fault. I guess I'm sentimental. Champagne or whiskey? Champagne. Yeah, me too. I won't ask you what you want to drink. You know, whiskey of course. Of course. Thank you. Here, that's yours. Thank you. Let's drink to our friendship, okay? - With pleasure. - That's fun. Hey, why don't you put on some music? Yeah, you're right. Let's dance a bit, okay? Uh-huh. Sorry. Nice place you got here. Yeah, it's not bad at all. You wanna dance? Why not? It looks like you dig tapestry. Yes, well. What have we here? Don't tell me you like art? I do a bit. Well, in that case let me show you a painting. It's absolutely extraordinary. Okay. Wanna dance? I'm too tired. Come along. Let me show you around the house. You can't just sit here. It will relax you. Come on. This one here is my favorite. It's very pretty. Come on, let's sit down. I've got quite a collection of contemporary paintings. I'll take you through it some day. How about yourself, do you paint? No, that is, I'd like to paint. But what I do for the time being is buy and sell paintings. Are you disappointed? Oh no, why should I be? It's interesting. Come on I'll show you some more. Later on, we'll look at them later altogether. It'll be more fun that way. Hey, what. What are you doing? No! Hey, a lover's quarrel? No, a minor difference of opinion. You must be hungry by now. How about a bite? I'm starving. What about you? Yeah, I could eat something. There's some smoked salmon in the fridge. What do you say we have a look what else there is? Okay? Yeah, I'm hungry. Okay hey, Peter! Now wait a sec. Here they come. Oh, thank you. Thank you. Hey, I've got an idea, just you wait. Cheers. Your friend's nice. He's always up to something. One thing's sure. He's never bored me yet. What kind of business is Peter in? It looks to me he's loaded. It's this way, he buys and he sells paintings. An art dealer. That's it. Oh. Oh. Oh. What's the matter with you? I don't know. I just feel kinda funny. Are you sick? No, it's nothing. What's wrong with me? I feel so strange. Champagne can do that sometimes. You too? I guess you're right. The drink went to my head. Peter, come on back here. Looks like they're ripe. I could've handled them alone, you know. What do you think? It's saleable merchandise. That's right. Come on, darling. Let's go have a look at my collection. Look at that one here. How about this? I saw madame Lena last night. I hope you didn't get me over here for nothing. You'll see, it's top quality. Real top quality goods. The best on the market. I hope so for your own sake, my boy. Let's check them out. We tried them out last night. They're real bangerinos. Were they both willing? Uh-huh, it took a bit of dope. Bizarre, let's have a look. Hmm, not bad. Not bad at all. What did I tell you? Well, you did. Ah, I trust there won't be any problems. Good looking, broads. They sure are. Okay, it's a deal. Get them to the garage. Delivery as usual. Payment as usual. Be on time for a change. The ship's leaving tomorrow. Oh stop. Hold her. She's out for 10 hours. Bring her right out to the pier. Okay. Come on, come on, hurry it up. Mind telling me why you're late? I run into a fucking traffic jam, that's what. Get them on board and make it snappy. And what's more, one's missing. He'll be here any minute now. Do you have any idea what time it is? He'll get here. That's it. We're out of territorial waters. Let's open the trunks, man. Go ahead. If you don't make any trouble, you'll get regular meals. We'll let you all take turns up on the bridge so you can stretch your legs and look at the sea. You won't be harmed if you do as you're told. Otherwise, you'll have him to deal with. I know how to make them happy. That's enough. I was only kidding. In that case, stop kidding. Leave the girls alone. I want them to get where they're going in good shape, get it? No, leave me alone! No, stop it! Oh, please, don't do it. Leave me alone! Where are you taking us? To your new home. A nice house somewhere down in Africa. It's called the house of lost oasis. How does that grab you? We're right on schedule. Tell them to get the girls into the dinghy. Okay. Here they come. Hurry up, for Christ's sake. Come on, girls. Move your asses. I said haul ass. Let me look at you. Cut it out. You bastard. Hey, baby. Bye. Take a break. Five minutes. All right, everybody takes five. Go on, stretch your legs. Hey, don't wander off too far, will you? No! No. No. Please, we're being held against our will. Warn the police. Eugenial, John, catch her. The black girl. No. Take her along. We can use her. Where is Pablo? Pablo? Pascal, Pablo. Mami, look. Everybody out. Out you go. Come on. Everybody inside on the double. The back way. Go on! Come on, move. Hurry up. Come on. Get a move on. Come on. Go on. That's yours. Here. You there. You over there. You in the back. You over here. Get up, you lazy slut. Gaby, can I see you a minute? You all get dressed. I'll be right back. That's when I tried to run away. They'd taken all our clothes, but that didn't faze me. I had to risk it no matter what. Please excuse me. I'll be right back. Madita. Will you keep this gentleman company? Hi. Hi. Hey, one of the new girls flew the Coop. It's Annie. I'm not surprised. We got to go and look for her. Come on. Move. Oh, please help me. I'm being held prisoner in the oasis. You mean this house over there? Yes. Yeah, I know that house. A bunch of gangsters. The police protect them. Yes, that's right. The bastards grabbed my girl. Okay, okay. Goddamn bastards. Let's run. I'll kill them. I want my girl out. Right now, they're after me. So what? They'll get you too, come on. I warned the police, but I don't know if they'll anything about it. Don't move! Don't move, I said. Stop it. Put your hands up. You're coming with us. No. No. I won't go back. No, I won't go back. What else could I have done? But you Mark my words, I'll try again. And it will work. Your running away is going to make it tough for all of us. Are you dumb or what? Don't you realize if I get out of here, I'll get the cops to get you out? I think we'll never get out. Well, it's not that bad. In the beginning, it's a bit rough. Then you get used to it. In the beginning, I thought I'd die. But I don't mind. Life here is not as bad as all that. And what's more, the food's good. Hey, tell us how you got here. It's quite a story. I had a nightclub act with a girlfriend in las palmas. We were living in a super hotel. We were earning a lot of money. Life was beautiful. That particular night was our last. We had a nude act, know what I mean? I'd noticed a man, rather strange looking with a special original way about him. He always wore a red tie and he always sat at a side table. He too had eyes for me. He'd invited me a couple of times to have a drink with him. Very polite. Very proper. And every night in my dressing room, I used to find a big bouquet of flowers which he'd had delivered. He always found something nice to write in his card. Since it was our last night, he'd invited me out for supper. And we ended up alone at his place at around two A.M. drinking champagne. Oh, thank you. To you. Cheers. I would like to make you a proposition which I think you will find very much to your liking. I'm listening. What would you say to a trip to Africa? I'd have to speak to Nina about it. Even if it means earning a lot of the money? No. Thank you very much. Not to worry about it. I tried the easy way, but apparently, I was wrong. So we'll do it the hard way. What the hell do you mean? I mean there are ways to convince you that a trip to Africa will do you a lot of good. Leave me alone. I know somebody who's very persuasive. You'll do anything just to get out of his hands. You're a tough one, my darling. But you haven't seen anything yet. My advice is better change your mind while you can still talk. Now what do you prefer? The sun, the peace and quiet of Africa, or more of the same? You strike me as a reasonable girl, huh? I'll do anything you want me to. Just stop this. That's a good girl. Life's a real bitch. Every time you meet a good looking man, you get fucked. And the nice guys don't give you no fun. I'll never believe anything a man says anymore. I've had it. What about you, Sophie? Oh, well, me, I'd come to Paris with a whole bunch of friends. You know what I mean, for the carnival. At night, we went out. I really enjoyed it. There was hits fantastic parade. And me and my friends were part of it. You see, we all belonged to a folklore dance group, and we'd been picked up in a nationwide selection. It was really something, doing our stuff in front of thousands of people lining the streets. We'd rehearsed for a whole year. You should've seen us. After dancing the whole day, well, we danced some more. Then we all decided to take in the fireworks on the senne river. I lost my friends in the crowd, but I figured I'd meet up with them later on at the hotel. Meanwhile, I watched the fireworks. I'd never seen anything like it. The whole river seemed to have been set aflame. And then, the same old story. A boy sort of picked me up. He looked nice. He talked to me. I didn't mind. Well, we got acquainted. He was polite, even gentle. And I must say, there was something about him, a quiet sort of charm. Well, let's say I dug him. And that's how I ended up here in Africa. I had no such luck. I was born here. All right, girls. Tonight, I'll do you a favor. You can keep the lights on after curfew, all right? But don't abuse the privilege or you'll hear from me. - We won't abuse it. - Thank you very much. I'd like to stress I consider good manners important above all. I shall not let anyone infringe upon this rule. Good night. Good night. Thank you. And no monkey business. The old bitch. What do you think this is? A college dormitory? Get into your beds. Bed. She's a bitch if ever there was one. We're in for fun. What the hell is this joint? You'll find out soon enough. Why don't you tell us how you landed in this paradise? One day, I decided to drop everything and hitchhike around a bit in Spain. The first week was just fine. I had me a ball. Sometimes I slept in youth hostels, and sometimes I crashed out in a field for the night. I never felt so good. I'll never forget it. Thumbing it was easy as pie. Once in a while, some asshole tried to bug me. I told one to fuck off and he chucked me out in the middle of nowhere. Goddamn bastard. Hi. Can I drop you off somewhere? No thanks. I'll wait for a rolls. What's wrong with a Mercedes? It's okay, but there's no bed. What's that supposed to mean? Forget it. I'll settle for it if we're going to alicante. That's where I'm going. My father owns a chain of women's clothing stores. High class stuff. I work for him, but my time is pretty much my own. You must have a lot of nice dresses. It all depends on what you mean by nice. It's mainly ready to wear, but he's a stickler for quantity. I'm expected at the office. Can I drop you somewhere? I'm going to a youth hostel called villa. Yeah, I know where that is. It isn't very far. I'll drop you over, huh? Here you are. Let me help you. Thank you. I'd like to see you again one of these days. I'm sorry, I can't. I'm only staying overnight. I'll be leaving tomorrow morning. I've got an idea. If you're free later this evening, why don't you come and join me at the Baghdad? Did you take along a dress? Hell no. I'm camping. Am I dumb? Well, come along and we'll get you one, okay? Go take a walk. Go on. Come here. Whip me. Beat me. Do it, whip me. Go on, do it. Pick me up later on. I'll take you to the Baghdad. We're in the same boat. We haven't heard any news from Katherine ever since she left for Spain. I was hoping you'd heard from her. No. Nothing for the last seven weeks. Except a postcard from valencia. I heard from her more recently. Let's see. She was in alicante. Here. Oh, that explains it. "I just met a very nice guy. "I rather like him. "He invited me to spend the evening with him" "in a nightclub, the Baghdad." Do you mind if I keep this card? Not at all. But what do you want it for? The police inspector we went to see a while ago when we began to get worried said he needed some clue. This may be a lead. Well, I got some info from interpol. They've been investigating this thing for a month in Italy and Spain with no results. You know the score. Go to work. Get out there. He said Baghdad? That's right. That's what it says on the postcard. Take it from there. All right. I'll take the first plane to alicante and see what I can do. Right. How many pieces are we shipping? Five halfwits without an ounce brains between them. Just your type. Really? Since you know the captain, you'll escort them. Where to? Same place. Service to Africa, here I come. Hi there. Police. What do you want? We can't complain. Business is picking up despite stagflation. Come here. Sit down. Tell me, did you notice anything fishy around here? What do you mean? Listen, I'm asking the questions. And when I ask a question, I don't want a question for an answer. I want an answer. No lies. Any shit you dish me out, I'll make you eat. I don't know nothing. Anything unusual goes on, you call me at this number. I don't want no trouble. Then play along with me. I won't forget. You be nice with me, and I'll be nice with you. You get the picture? Now, how's this for a start? Freeze. Stop it. And he's got a gun. They're gonna close down here. Let's make it elsewhere. Yeah, great. How about the hoof on the roof? Yeah, great. Hello? Went great, inspector. Good. And I'm following it all the way to soweto in Africa. Would you phone up Sanchez and tell him I'm coming? But why Africa? That's where the girls are. In that case, go ahead. I'll call right away so we can pick you up at the airport. What flight? First one out. 210 Madrid. 210. Good hunting. Don't forget, call in. Will do. Detective Roland's due here in an hour. Interpol is probably wiring you. Yeah. And I hope with the information you've just given us, we'll put these people behind bars. May I ask you to act with care? Big wigs are involved. I don't want to get bounced. We're fully aware of your situation, sir. Officially, I know nothing. If, as you tend to think, the white slavers hold out in sassandra. I do. I want to make sure you get full police cooperation. Lieutenant dufo will help you. All right. Hello? Yes. It's for you. Oh. Thank you. Hello? Hello? Arturo? Yep. Roland. Yeah. You're tough to reach. Next time, try using a tamtam. I thought you'd be here by now. No, I'm playing the tourist. You may be right. Incognito is the best way to sleuth. What about you? What's the news? A small freighter docked this morning. That's interesting. Yes. It could well be the one we're expecting. Only one way to find out. I get on it and check it out. Good luck. Thanks. But you're just a tourist. I'll keep my trigger finger on the camera. Goodbye. Ciao. Right. I'll back you up from here. Don't worry about a thing. All right? Yeah, let's go. I'd go for a beer. Let's get one down the hatch. It's a nice way to travel. Rather cozy. The captains got queer tastes. Yeah. Horse dung. Great nose. Mmm, Kentucky straight bourbon. Hey, what do we got here? Not bad. Look. Pigeon loft. What do you suppose it could mean? Drop it. How many men on board? I don't know exactly. Four, I think. You'll be out of here in a jiffy. Hang on. Stay where you are. You know what the pigeon loft is? No, I don't know. We'll see. Are you going to tell me now? It's in the desert where they take the girls. I better go tell Arturo. That's all I know. Fucking a. Damn. That was stupid. I shouldn't have hit him so hard. Come on, forget it. He's dead and good riddance. I don't give a damn whether he's dead or alive except he could have answered some questions. What's done is done. Forget it. Let's quiz the sailors. They may give us a clue. Yeah, but the whole thing smells of police protection. It'll be covered up before we can raise a finger. Well, there may be a way out. You're on an official mission for interpol. As such, you can move around to get a maximum of information. Meanwhile, I'll follow our lead and try to pinpoint the pigeon loft's exact location around here. Then I'll head out to the sassandra and see the police chief. If the lead pans out, he might pitch in with us. All right I'll take care of it. Thank you. Now let's get down to business. Go on, I'm listening. Chief, I'm slamming the ball down on your side of the court. What I need now is facts. Will you play along? If I can. Tell me what you know. Well, I'll round out the picture for you. 10 ks out of here, there's some kind of an inn, a whorehouse out in the desert. The oasis. I know all about it. But the boss is untouchable. She's got connections everywhere I turn. Her contacts reach all the way to the top. Big business and politics. Get the picture? I read you. Well, that's it. I see. You're really hamstrung. Yeah. I didn't give up easy. I tried to raid the place on several occasions. She was warned every time. What happens if I bring you proof the girls I'm after are held there against their will? I'll move in. But soon as she finds out you're a cop, she'll call her connections. Why should she find out? I'm on vacation. You might get away with it. Read this statement. This man who just walked out, they abducted his fiance. She's probably being held there. It's your move now. I've never seen you here before, and I'm a regular customer. That figures. I'm new here. That's why, you're new on the job. That's right. You like it here? I like it where it's hot. In that case, honey, you ain't got nothing to complain about. I meant the weather. Did you? Well, I'm not here to talk about the weather. Come on, Zeke. Come on. What's a cat like you doing here? No! Stop pawing me. Well? Let's go. How are you? Hi there. I just got here and I don't know anybody. I'm in the real estate business. You know if there's any land for sale around here? It all depends on how much you want to spend. Same thing, sir? Here you are, Mr. Jones. How about you mr? Granadas. Michele granadas. I'll have the same thing. All right. And don't short change him. He just got here. He came to guy some land, for you information. Welcome to sassandra, sir. The first drink is always on the house. Well, thank you. Cheers. Cheers to you. Is this the only place around? Not much action. Hang on. Take a good look at me. If you say so. My friend Michele would like to join the private club, hmm? Yes, but... of course, I'll be responsible. Why, of course, Mr. Jones. Let's take a look at the back. We've got some real hot numbers. After you. It's that way. You're really something. I've never seen anybody as beautiful as you. Do you believe me? I really mean it. You could be a Hollywood star. Thank you. Did you ever try movies? Mm-hmm. I bet they all tried to sleep with you. All right. I'm coming. Seeing is believing. Didn't I tell you? It looks just great. Can we take our pick? Of course. Take anybody you want upstairs. How about that one? We'll fix it up for you. Look at that, quite an actor. I'll bet you like that. All right men, to the house. Get out of the way. Who the hell are you? Police. We're coming in for a look. Wait for director gets back. I can't let you in. Get the fuck out of the way. She'll get your ass for this. I told you the manager was out. Drop it, Antonio. You're not taking another step until you show me your warrant. Get off your high horse. There's no need for a search warrant. We have ample evidence you abducted and hold me mami amameta. Now let me tell you this, get out of here immediately, buster, or you're out on your ass. You open that door. Who the hell is he? A customer. He was here yesterday. You had no right to snoop around this way. I was on leave yesterday. I came on my own, but today I'm back on duty. Now open that door. You, over there. You keep your eye on her. It's not our fault. They made us do it. Ask her. It's really the truth. They brought us out here. We had no choice but to do it. They forced us. Don't be afraid. We know all about it. We'll take down your story at headquarters. Okay. They be getting away. Hold on. Stay put, okay? You keep an eye on them. Stop them from getting to the Jeep. You, come with me. Get down, you fool! Calling headquarters. Do you read? Send over the helicopter on road 301. Roger. Where are we supposed to go? To the boat, you idiot. You've got to get us to the boat. They're too close on our tail. We'll lose them. Take the shortcut. You idiot, look where you're going! Hey, watch out. It's a chopper. Hurry up. We better fan out. Antonio! Antonio! Ah. Keep them up. The games up, ma'am. Amidu! Amidu! Madita!
