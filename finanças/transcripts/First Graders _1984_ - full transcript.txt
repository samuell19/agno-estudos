Boys, pay attention, stay in line and be silent otherwise you can't understand where your place is. For instance, you there. Tell him your name. You memorize his face and tell him your name. Good. Turn around and tell him your name. Remember the faces of the ones I introduce you to. You? Good. And you? Speak up. Good. And you? Speak up. Tell him your name. What's your name? What's your name? Say it louder! Good. You, tell him your name. Turn around, look at him and say it again. Your name? Speak up. And you? Turn around. What's your name? Turn on the other way. This way. What's your name? What? What? Let's say "well done" to Mohammadi. Well done! One hundred, one thousand times well done. Boys, look at me. Stay in line, each in his own place. Without some order you won't learn your places. Turn around and introduce yourself. Did you see his face? Well done. You? - Good. How fast. You? - Mister Ebranimi. You call yourself Mister? Speak up. Well done! And you? Some of you compete to see who speaks louder. And you? And you? You, introduce yourself. Say it louder! Good! And you? Speak up. Be quiet. Are you sure that's your name? Abolfazl, good! And you? Some of you speak loudly. And you? What? Say it again. Very good. Have you learned you places? Yes. - The right distances? - Yes. Now we'll exercise. Look at me. Also you Baghinejad, so you won't get distracted. One... two... three... four... Pay attention. I repeated it, but over there you're not listening. What are you two doing? Get out of the line. You, with the brown shirt. Hey you, look at me. Everybody look at me. Yes, you. And you too. The one with the brown shirt who turned around. No, he knows it. You with the blue shirt. Out. Yes, you with the green eyes, come out. Also his neighbour. Stand on that step. After the bell rings you come to the principal's office. Stop there. Move over a bit. - What were you doing while in line? - The spitting game. And you? Speak up. - I was playing the spitting game. - What game is that? Does it seem a nice thing to do? Where did you learn it? - Where did you learn it? - He started it. Get closer. You too. - Who started it first? - He did. Was it you? Think it through. Speak. If he does it, should you do it too? He started it. And so? Did you have to spit? He spat and then I did it too. What did we say? When someone makes a mistake... What should we do? How many times did I repeat it? If someone makes a mistake, what should we do? - Repeat what I said. - We have to explain. We have to explain that what he did... Isn't right. And the one who makes a mistake what should he do? - He should apologize. - Speak up. - The first time, what do we do? - We forgive him. - If he doesn't apologize? - We don't forgive him. - And what do we do? - We tell you. If he does it again, what do we do? We warn him. If he apologizes, the second time what do we do? We forgive him. - And the third time? - We don't forgive him. Even if he apologizes we can't forgive him because he did it three times. Why didn't you come to me? I was in line. How's that? You were able to spit but not to come to me? I forgot about it. And why did you start? He came... he... Think it through. If you stutter you're not thinking. Think it through and tell me why you did it. He spat to me, so I did the same. You said you started first. What happened? Why did you do it? What's your name? - Speak up - Reza Ahmadian. - What grade are you in? - In first. So why did you start spitting? As a game? Is it a game? What? Speak up. Have you understood this is not a game? So? - Spitting is not a game. - Good, this should not happen again. - Apologize to him. - Sorry. - And you. - Sorry. Shake hands and go back to the classroom. - Why are you here? - He... Speak up. While I was walking I tripped over a stone. I took it, I threw it and it hit him on the hand. Hosseini got angry and he went to Mahmud. They passed by me and said a bad thing to me. What did they say? Your mother and your father took you from Africa. Then I came to tell you. What did you say to him? It was Hosseini. Then he apologized one hundred times. - Why one hundred times? - I wanted to apologize. - What did you say to him? - Nothing. It was him. - I didn't do it. - What did he do? - He was laughing at me. - Then he apologized. Then he apologized? You can go. You, come here. Don't go away, stay there. - Where? - There is fine. What did you say to him? They told me my father has measles. - What did you answer? - Nothing. I went to Mahmudzaden, then they came back and told me that I come from Africa. You started it and then I said the thing about the measles. He's lying, sir. Which is the truth? Did you say it or did he say it? How's that? You threw a stone at him and you come here to complain! - Who threw the stone? - It was him. Then they beat me with a big stick. Where did you get the stick? Did he hit you from behind? And they said bad words to me. You go over there. Mahmud, come here. - Who beat you up? - I wanted to report to you... He said bad words to me and stepped on my hand. - Why? - I didn't do it, I swear. Tell me why! I fell on him without wanting to. That happens to you often, true? What happened then? I apologized. It's not true! They ran away with the bus. Didn't you promise you wouldn't do this again? Just tell me this. Leave aside those two. - Sorry. - Is that all? I apologize to everyone. Why did you tell him that he comes from Africa? - Me? - Who else, then? - He said it. - That's not true, it was Hosseini. - Why did you tease him? - But I said I was sorry. Let this be the last time, you got it? You don't report someone when you're guilty yourself! Take the note and go back to class. The bell didn't ring. Do we have to go to lunch? It doesn't matter. Just go. Come here. What happened while you were in line? He grabbed me by my neck. Then you told us to come by your office. Why did you do it? Good morning. - I didn't do anything. - Nothing? How many times did I ask you to come here? and you dare deny it? Think about it and tell me. Why did you grab him by the neck? Thanks a lot. So? Did he start it? What did you do to him? - Nothing... he... - Speak up. He grabbed me by the shoulders. Did you play a prank on him? Does the line up seem like right place for it? What did you do to him? Nothing, it was him. How? He jumped on me without reason. Third period had rung, hadn't it? Why did you leave the line? - Don't you want to remain in this school? - Yes. Don't you like the school? So, why did you do it? Since you're new in this school, I'll give you another chance. This time I'm not going to write down your name. You either, since this is your first time. You'll remain among the disciplined students. Apologize. - Sorry. - You too. Shake hands. With the right hand! Go back to your class. Madam, can I help you? - I want to enroll my son. - In the next room. - Hello. - Hello, please take a seat. - I want to enroll him. - Why did you wait until today? I've been sick, I couldn't come. - What's your name? - Mohammad-Reza Saffari. Did you bring the birth certificate? Let your mother hand it to you. He could come last year. - They entered an extra year. - Why? His father thought that he would have attended the military service earlier. How old are you? Do you know? - Answer me. - No. You're seven and you can come to school. How high can you count? What did you say? Speak up, now you're a grownup. - How high can you count? - Up to 100. Try. Let's hear it. Look at me and start counting. 1, 2, 3, 4... Speak up. Attention! Attention! What are you doing over there? When you hear the bell... Why aren't you at your place? Go to your place. We have a new student. It's his first day of school. He still doesn't know the rules. But I see he is very disciplined. In order to know this disciplined boy and to get acquainted with him, I invite him here. Mohammad-Reza, please come here. Come here. This is his first day of school. He was properly in line and I'd like to introduce him to you. Given his skill and manners, we'll all say to him: well done! 10, 100, 1000 times well done. Starting today he will be your friend. I'll be even nicer to anyone who becomes his friend. Let's congratulate again. 10, 100, 1000 times well done! Go back to your place. The ones in the first grade grab each others hand. Go slowly to the classroom. Come here. What is it? I lost my cup. Did you lose your cup? When did it happen? - When? - During break. Are you sure you brought it along? - What colour was it? - Orange. Was it a folding cup? - Was your name on it? - No. - What's your name? - I wrote it down but it tore off. - What's your name? - Mehrdad. Are you crying about your cup? Why are you crying? You shouldn't. Look at me. Don't cry. - My mother will yell at me. - She'll yell at you? If we find it, she won't do it. Don't cry, you're a grownup now. I'll ask the boys to find it. Are you sure you had it with you? If your mother asks about it, tell her you left it at school and that the deputy headmaster will find it. Don't cry anymore. Wash your face and go back to your class. Come to the front, Hatami. Ashuri, you too. What did Ashuri do? He hit my tummy. Come here. Why did you do it? He took my hand and he pulled it. And what did you do? Did you hit him on his tummy to make him cry? Why did you do it? How many times have you been here? Two? The last time you made a promise. Which was? Hurry, I've got things to do. - That I wouldn't do it anymore. - Or else? - You would write my name down. - Exactly. - Apologize. - Sorry. Look at him. Do you remember hurting him? Now I'll write down your name. What will happen if you do it again? What could I do to you? - You could expel me from school. - Right, I'll expel you. Do you like this school? So don't do it anymore. Take the note and go back to your class. Come up front. - Noruzi and I were playing... - Speak up. Noruzi and I were pretending to fight. Then he did it for real and he punched me. He hurt me. Who told you to get out of the line? - I don't remember. - I said it. Don't you remember? You know why? You were talking. Why didn't you wash your mouth after the snack? How many times have you come here? Four. Why are you laughing? Did I already write down your name? Why? What did you do to your forehead? There was a deaf-mute who was building a house next to the tree where I was climbing. I fell off and he continued building the house. What were you looking for on that tree? The tree was ours. I know you weren't stealing, but what kind of tree was it? - A cherry tree. - And you got hurt? Did you bleed? This is what happens when you're distracted. Don't you want to remain in this school? No? From your behaviour I would say you don't. You don't seem sorry and you keep laughing. Do I have to throw you out? Eh? No? Do you promise you won't do it anymore? Are we in agreement? Don't do it anymore. What grade are you? The first. Go back to your class and clean your mouth. Kia-Amiri, come here. What did you do? Speak up. - He twisted my hand. - Why did you do it? He did like this with my hand and then... And then, what did you do? Did you twist his hand? You saw he was crying, why did you do it? And why did you start it? - I was joking. - Ah, really? So he was also joking. If I say not to do it, it's because then either you fight or you cry. He was also joking, just more strongly. Who started it? Who did it first? So? Was it you? How many times did I warn you? - Out loud. - Five times. - What's up with your voice? - I'm sick. How's that? In the courtyard you were fine. How many times did I reproach you, Kia-Amiri? Five times. Didn't you promise the last time? Tell me your promise. - And if you didn't keep it? - You would expel me. Exactly. Now I have to write the expulsion letter. Don't say no. We agreed, if you behaved badly I would expel you, and now I'll do it. Apologize to him for twisting his hand. You go back to your class and he goes home. We don't need him. What grade are you? The first. Don't do it anymore. Next time you'll tell it to me. You don't need to twist his hand. Wait there while I write the letter. This time you've gone too far. You two, come here. What's your name? What did you do? He hit me with a pistachio shell. He rubbed it on the floor... Speak up. It became hot and he threw it here. - What did he rub on the floor? - A pistachio shell. Does it get hot, when you rub it? Why? - With the sun. - But it was in the shade! So, how did it become hot? Do you know why? Because... the sun warms up the floor... No, it gets warm with the static energy. - Did you want to throw it away? - Yes. I hit him instead. - You didn't do it on purpose? - In this case I'll forgive him. Right, you forgive him, because he didn't hit you on purpose. But I don't, I told him you mustn't throw shells. Go to your classroom. - How many times have you been here? - Two. Didn't you promise? You're also not keeping your word. Let me have a look at your neck. Oh, my God! Look at it. It's burned. Let him have a look at it again. It seems that it doesn't matter to you to have burned your friend's neck. Do you forgive him? Go to your classroom. What did you promise? - That I wouldn't do it anymore. - And what if you did? - You would expel me from school. - When did you promise it? - What's your name? - Lotfi. - Lotfi and then what? - Mohammad-Reza. Did I say that if you did it again I would expel you from school? I'll prepare the letter and you'll go away, then. - I swear that I didn't... - Don't swear. You didn't do it on purpose? I'll forgive you in part. Why did you rub the shell? What should I do now? Tell me how I should punish you. - Forgive me. - Forgiveness is not a punishment. What can I do? Don't do it again, will you? Go back to class. Amiri, come here. Did it pass? Did you hope we wouldn't expel you? How many times did I reproach you since the year started? Did you lose your voice again? - Clear your voice. - Five. What does your father do? He repairs cranes. Is your mother employed? Where does she work? - Where does she work? - In the maternity ward. In the hospital? Is she a nurse? Does she work at day or night? Every morning until 12. - Who do you live with? - I'm alone. - Alone? Do you have any keys? - I go fetch them at the hospital. - And what do you do at home? - I eat and then go to bed. - Where does she leave your meal? - Next to the cupboard. Tell your mother to come here tomorrow afternoon. At 3.30 pm. I want to talk to her about your situation at home. Yesterday one of your classmates lost his cup. Perhaps one of you took it by mistake because it was of the same color. Who told you to go out? Go back to your place. Yesterday one of your classmates lost his cup. He was very worried because he had lost his cup. The label with his name tore off. It's an orange cup. Perhaps one of you took it by mistake. And now he has two of them in his schoolbag. To be sure to find it sit down and check your schoolbag. If there are two cups, one of them is his. Now sit down. Check your schoolbags. Now get up. Grab your schoolbags. Turn around. Now go. Come here. - What's your name? - Abdul Maleki. Why are you late? My eye was hurting. Did you come here with your mother? Ok. Go back to your classroom. You, come here. - What's your name? - Ebrahim. Why did you arrive late? Last night I did the homework that our teacher gave us but I forgot them. - Where are they now? - At home. Didn't you bring them? You can go, it doesn't matter. You, come here. - What's your name? Speak up. - Maani. - What's the surname? - Roshanchi. Why are you late? Speak up. I got up early, I had breakfast I got dressed but the car didn't start. The other did, so I came. Is the car responsible? But you didn't even wash your face! Wipe near your eye. - I was in a hurry. - In a hurry? Do you promise that you won't be late again? Go to your classroom. You, come here. What's your name? Speak up. - Why are you late? - I forgot my drawings. I told my mother and I went back to pick them up. Do you promise that you won't be late again? Why is there a spot of dirty color on your face? - Where? - Under the eye. What is it? Give it to me. Do you want to go for the shoes? You can go. Don't be late again. Go to your classroom. You, come here. What's your name? Come here and speak louder. Mohammad Jahanbaghsh. What is it? Did you find it in the corridor? Put it outside. Where the lost objects are. Why did you arrive late? - Look at me and speak up. - I fell asleep. Come here. What happened? Tell me. I'm afraid my mother will beat me. Why? What did he do to make you cry? I was doing something and he called me, he kicked me and then he left. Are you crying because it hurts? Why did you hit him? He had given... - He had given me a kick. - Did you start it? I hit him softly, he gave me a strong kick instead. Why did you kick him? I kicked him first. Then the others came and they kicked him again. Then he kicked me once. Did you start it or not? Yes, but then the others came. I'm speaking about you. You started it and then he kicked you. Why did you do it? He gave me a kick on my leg. The first one wasn't strong but the other one was stronger. And what did you do? You hit him even stronger. If someone beats you up or steals something from you, what should you do? I came to tell you, but you weren't in the office. Was this a good reason to beat him up? Do you know that you made a mistake? And you? - Will you do it again? - No. Neither will you? Go to your classrooms. Close the door. What is it? Ahmad said that I kicked him. So the teacher told us off and he told me to come here. Was it the first time? - Did he already tell you off? - Yes. - When? - Yesterday? What did he say to you? He asked my deskmate what I was doing. He answered that I was beating him up. And the teacher sent me down. Why did you go out of the line, yesterday? Someone threw a piece of plastic and so I did the same. I wanted to hit him. Do you also have to repeat what the others do? How many times have I told you that you must rebuke anyone making mistakes? You mustn't imitate him! You don't want to follow the rules. You can't go back to the classroom, go to the courtyard until I decide what actions to take against you. For now you're excluded both from the line and the class. You know that the others are in class and you aren't? Now go down to the courtyard alone. And if you continue, I'll expel you from the school! Could you tie my laces up? It's so funny! - How much did you pay for them? - I don't know. If I give you some chocolate, will you give me half an apple? I can't cut it. Let's bring it to the director. How many parts? How many parts? How many parts? How can I cut it? You've already bitten it. - Gholghali bit it. - Gholghali? Tell him to come here. Why did you eat his apple? - Why did you do it? - I don't know. Didn't you notice it? How did he take it? I was looking at the blackboard, I turned around and I saw him. Why? Did you ask for his permission? He didn't ask me. Think before answering. Don't prattle. Do you have permission to eat in class? And to take things from your friend? Did you bring an apple or some other fruit? Didn't he have it? - Did he have it? - Yes, a red apple. - It was my friend's. - Who? - Majid. - Speak up. - In which class is he? - In the second. Did you take it from him? Why? He told me to cut it and eat it. So you were in the courtyard. If you had asked him, wouldn't he have given you a piece of it? Wouldn't you have given a piece to him? - Answer me! - Yes. How did you know that he wouldn't give it to you? How? Taking the apple without permission, dirtying it with your hands and saliva! That's why we cut it. So everyone can eat his piece. Isn't that so? You don't mix up saliva. You ask me and I'll cut it for you. You won't do it anymore, will you? Try to obey. Do you forgive him? Apologize out loud. - Sorry. - Tell him: "No problem". Go back to your class. Come here. Why are you crying? I was trying to stay in line, but I fell and I hit my head. - Did you fall or were you pushed? - He pushed me. - Did you get hurt? - Yes. Why did you push him? Answer out loud. Look at me. Why did you push him? He twisted my arm. When? - Earlier. - When? - During the break. - And what did you do? - I pushed him. - And then what happened? - Hello. - Hello. - What happened? - He fell. - Where did he fall? - On the step. On the step? Did the head swell? Look at him. Touch his head. The courtyard is very dirty, could you reproach the kids? Certainly, during the next break. Have you seen how swollen it is? What do we do now? - What? - I don't know. Did he hurt you much? - It still hurts. - Still? Didn't I say to you not to push each other? Why did you do it, then? What do we do now? The same thing you did to him? He pushes you and you hit your head. Do you want that? - How? - I forgive him. Despite the bad things he did to you, do you forgive him? - What's your name? - Mahammad Mahmudi. - And what's your name? - Abbas Nikmalek. Since you don't seem very sorry, next time you'll be out. Wash your face and go back to your class. He remains here for now. Nikmalek, come back here. I don't want you to return to class. - What's your name? - Nikmalek. You shouldn't go back to class, you're not sorry. Let him go. - He's not regretful. - Leave him. - Why? - He didn't do anything wrong. Yes. You forgave him, but he didn't regret. - Let him go. - Why? - He'll miss the lesson. - Do you mind? Do you see how much he cares for you? He cries and defends you. Do you see how good he is? You, however, don't show even a bit of remorse. You didn't even tell him you're sorry. You stay there and look at me. Look at him, he's crying because you'll miss the lesson. He doesn't want you to stay behind, he's begging me to let you go, so you don't miss your lesson. And you keep a straight face. Perhaps you didn't notice that you pushed him? Did you do it on purpose? - How? - I didn't do it on purpose. So that's why you're not regretful, you didn't do it on purpose. Don't do it anymore. Is it the first time that you come to me? I'll say to everyone that he is a good boy. Apologize. Sorry. - Do you forgive him? - Yes. Shake hands and be good friends. Give each other a kiss. Wash your faces and go back to class. Why are you here again? Come in. Did you miss the lesson this time? Didn't they let you in? How many times have you come here today? What did you do this time? If you don't tell me, I can't know it. What did you do in class? Can you tell me? Tell me what you did in class. Answer me, I can't hear you, if you want I won't look at you. - Did you misbehave in class? - Yes. - Was it the right thing to do? - No. Why did you do it? How many times have you come here? You were the first to take the note. Ali-Reza? Beyghi. - What's your brother's name? - Mohammad Reza. Has he ever come to my office? Why? Why hasn't he come? Answer me, don't look at me that way. Why? - I don't know. - You don't know? Think about it. Why doesn't he do these things, even if you are twin brothers and you attend the same class? Why doesn't he do these things? Say it out loud, why doesn't he do them? - Because he's a good boy. - Out loud. - He's a good boy. - And so are you. But he pays more attention. When the teacher sends you out of the classroom, do you think you did something good? - Was it a good thing? Speak up. - Very bad. I won't tell anybody. You mustn't tell anyone, the others could imitate you. What will you do from now on? I won't look at you, so you can speak out loud. What will you do now? - Speak up. - Nothing. Nothing? There are many things to do. Which one mustn't you do? The ones that aren't good. So look at your brother's good actions. And he will pay attention when you do them. Do you promise me? You can go. Take the note and go back to class. Take a big breath. I have two things to tell you, one is about a good student, the other one is about the warden, mister Hosseinzadeh. Please mister Hosseinzadeh, come here. Mister Hosseinzadeh come here, please. This is Mahmudi, one of his friends pushed him by mistake. He hit his head on the steps and it swole. He came to my office crying. I told him to do the same to his friend, but he said to me: "No, I forgive him". - And what did he do? - He forgave him. He's a disciplined boy, ready to forgive. Congratulate him. Well done, 100, 1000 times well done! You can go. Here's mister Hosseinzadeh. Give him a big greeting. Say thanks to him. May your hand be blessed. He was complaining about the garbage that remains on the courtyard. Some of you don't pay attention and throw away plastic bags. You, is this the time to go to the toilet? Go back to your place. Move! He's an excellent partner that keeps the courtyard cleaned. Yesterday after the break the courtyard wasn't clean. Don't throw away plastic bags, biscuit boxes and the leftovers of the snacks. He complained about you. The boys promise that they won't do it anymore. During the next break they'll clean up the whole courtyard. They won't litter anymore. - Have you understood? - Yes. Kids from the first class, come out. Thanks. What are you eating? Come to me then. - Can we smell the flowers? - Of course. Sir, they call me Little Red Riding Hood. Because you have one. You, come here. Why did you arrive late? My father sent me to the bakery. He said to me: "If there are few people buy ten flat breads, otherwise just take two of them". Yesterday it happened that everyone had taken the bread and had forgotten about me. At the end I took the bread and we had breakfast. Then we received a phone call. On the phone they told us that my uncle had had a stroke. And then, on the radio they said it was 8 in the morning. Tomorrow you'll come with your mother or father, so that I'll better understand the story of the baker. Come here. Why did you put your shoes on the wrong feet? It always happens when you're late. Either you don't wash yourself or you get your clothes wrong. Why are you late? I went to bed late and when I woke up my mother told me to go to wash myself. I had breakfast and went to the bathroom. When I came out it was 8. - Then... - Did your mother wake you up late? Why did you go to bed late? - What's your name? - Majid Arabi. Tomorrow you'll come with your mother. Go and put on your shoes properly. You, come here. Why are you late, Jaffari? - I went to bed... - So what? Everyone does it. Yes, but my mother kept calling me and making me get up. Then she asked me why I went to bed early. - Who asked that? - My mother. I told her I wanted to get up early to go to school. So she told me to go to sleep. But then she woke me up again. If you went to bed early, why did you arrive late? Go to your class and give the paper to your mother. Because I had to... I had to help my mother at home. To do what? She asked me to clean the table. When I started cleaning it she told me to let it go and she sent me to bed. I fell asleep and she called me again. Did she wake you up again? All right, tell your mother to come here tomorrow. Give this to your mother and go to class. Come here, Ekran. Why did you arrive late? I went to bed early. I woke up at 7. - I got dressed to go out. - Did you eat anything? - I had breakfast... - With tea? - Bread and tea. - And then what? We went to pick up my friend and we came here. From 7 you had all the time. Where's your friend? - He's in the fourth grade. - Fourth? - Do you have any friends in the fourth grade? - Yes. Give this to your mother and ask her to come here tomorrow. I want to know about your friend and why you arrived late. - What is it? - I want to go home. - Why? - I want to go away. - With who? - I'll wait for my mother to come. Your mother isn't here now. She told me to... - What did she say? - To wait for her at the gate. But she can't now, she has to clean and prepare lunch. Is it you first day of school? You mustn't cry, mother works and you come to school. You're big. Your workplace is at school. But my mother is waiting for me! - Are you sure she's out? - That's what she told me. Go have a look, if she's there you can go, otherwise come back here and you wait for her until noon. Where are you going? - To my mother. - She hasn't arrived, yet. The kid you punished threw all the biscuits on the table and he ate them. On which table? - On the table in your office. - Were you there? Why? - You told me to. - Yes, it's true. Did you come here to make a report? I didn't ask you to tell on him. What? Speak louder. I didn't tell you to make a report on everything. So? - I didn't know that. - He didn't tell you anything. I told you to come here to complain only when someone is bothering you or is taking your stuff. But you mustn't speak ill of someone. You mustn't say "They had a fight", "He did that" or "The other one dressed badly". - Didn't I explain the difference to you? - I don't know. Now you know it, if someone bothers you and he doesn't apologize you can complain. But you mustn't speak ill of the others. Do you agree? - I won't do it. - Good, you can go. Today we'll do a new exercise. An exercise with the ears. Let's see who can do it. Move your ears. Now the eyes. Move the finger closer and gaze it. In this way you strengthen the eye muscles. It's also funny. Now with the fingers. All right. One, two, three, four.
