[eerie music] [heart beating] [water rushing] [heart beating rapidly] [monitor beeping] [monitor flatlining] MAN (ON RADIO): Hot, hot, hot, and no end in sight-- currently, we've got 91 degrees downtown. But we expect to reach a high today of 109. You heard me. So leave it right here, San Paolo, and we'll do our best to keep you frosty. [music playing] Hey. Hey. What's wrong? Oh, the air conditioner is blowing hot air. It's got a leak somewhere. I don't know. Some engineer. I happen to be a specialist. Really? - Hi, Richie. - Hey, guys. - Hey, Allison. - Hey, Richie. Hi. Look. A Compudog, Dad, can I have one? I want one, too. I-- I've got to go. BOBBY: You don't even know what it is. Uh, what about Compudog? I leave it in your capable hands. Goodbye. Bye, kids. See you later. AMELIA: Bye, Daddy. RICH: Bye, Mr. Miller. Bye-bye, Al, and have a good day at the hospital. [laughter] BOBBY: I'm going to feed him one more time. RICH: Oh, boy, he was thirsty. AMELIA: Hey, let me do it. Bye, Dad. Bye-bye. See you tonight. AMELIA: Bye, Daddy. Must be nice. Yeah. I'll drop Bobby and Amelia off at the hospital when I'm done, OK? All right, you guys, have fun. Thank you. Bye, Mom. Bye, Mommy. RICH: See ya. - Hey. Cool. Richard, let's go. [dramatic music] Hey, Bob. [phone ringing] MAN (ON PA): Bob Miller, you have a telephone call. Bob Miller, you have a telephone call. Take it at my desk, Bob. Miller. Hey, Lou. What's up? Um, well, how about my office in 30 minutes? OK, what's going on? All right, tell me later, yeah. Hey, boss. Bob. So what was so important you couldn't tell me over the phone? You're looking pretty snazzy there. Yeah, I, uh, have been down to the mayor's office. So what is it, rationing? We've been expecting that. I've been working on possible scenarios. We can handle it. Damn it, Bob, it's not rationing, at least not yet. Besides, that's not your job. That's my job. Oh, well, my apologies. Look. We, uh, have got a situation. Lou, whatever it is, just-- just say it. LOU: The plant. What about it? They cut the funding for the new plant. Cut? Eliminated. [moaning] [monitor beeping] OK, continue the IV. See if she'll keep any water down. Monitor the output. Run a full panel. Send her blood downstairs. Mrs. Hackett, I'm Susan Miller. Uh, admit her? [moaning] How's she doing? Abdominal pain, fever, dehydration. MRS. HACKETT: My stomach. Flu? That or food poisoning. Thirsty, so thirsty. Here you go. Mrs. Hackett, we're going to take very good care of you. Do you remember what you had for dinner last night? See if you can get a history. Hamburger, we had hamburger. Thirsty, so thirsty. Hi. Is this Morning Glen? Yeah, I'm calling from Saint Michael's Regional Hospital. We've just admitted one of your residents, Clara Hackett. Right, I'm going to need to know what your menu has been for the past couple of days. [moaning] Uh, I'll call you back. Exam four and five. Water, can you give me some water? [beeping] [phones ringing] [monitor beeping rapidly] [monitor flatlining] Code blue, exam one. FEMALE DOCTOR: All right, get the crash cart in here. MALE DOCTOR: Coming through. - All right, let's bag her. Come on. Let's go. Here we go. Here we go. MALE DOCTOR: Got it. FEMALE DOCTOR: What's the LSP? Clear. All right, again, clear. Again, clear. Again, clear. What the hell happened? Mrs. Hackett and the patients in bed four and five all live at the same address. What are you talking about? Morning Glen Retirement Home. Same kitchen, same meals? They all had hamburger for dinner last night. OK, get on the line to county health. Tell them there might be some bad meat out there, and they've got to get on top of this fast. It's Daddy's truck. Is Daddy home? [power tool running] I guess so. Go on. Wow. Hey, guys. How's my girl? What is it? This is my space station, right? That's right, no more launch delays. It's a little messy right now, but give me some time. It's gonna look great. - Can I help? - Well, you better. Great, I'll go get my tools. Good. Hey. You're home early on a weeknight to, uh, have a beer and build a playhouse for your son? Yeah, well, what's wrong with that? Um, nothing, uh, it's just that in the nine months that we've been here, it hasn't happened before. Well, I thought it might be a, uh, good chance to, uh, to update my resume. What happened? Lou's not sure. All he could get from the mayor was that funding is no longer available, and the project is postponed indefinitely. But the bond issue was specifically to design and build a brand-new, state of the art treatment facility. That's why they brought you here. Well, that's the other shoe. I have until the end of the month. I'm so sorry. [dog barking] [crickets chirping] Lights out, kiddo. OK. Have you figured out the secret yet? Not yet. Dad? Yeah? What if I wanted to change my name to Neil Armstrong? Are you really ready to give up the name Miller? I'll think about it. That's always a good idea. Are we going to move again? Oh, kiddo, let's not worry about that now, OK? Rich stayed in San Paulo his whole life. Yeah, I-- I know. Hey, I like it here, too. You ready? Yeah. Martha visits every Monday. Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars. Just Stays Until Noon. Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune. Very good. Pluto. Goodnight, kiddo. Goodnight. Well, they're down. I don't want to leave. Do you think I do? OK, hear-- hear me out, all right? I can go on full time at the hospital. And, um, we have our savings. And we can just hold out here until you find something else here. You know, it's not just the money. This was a chance to use everything I know, everything I've learned, everything I-- I-- I believe in. It was a chance to finally do things right. ANNA ORONOZ (ON TV): The sudden illness that has left two residents of the Morning Glen home dead and 11 others hospitalized at Saint Michael's remains a mystery. Earlier today, Jason Croft spoke with a Dr. Lawrence Carver of the County Medical Department. Everything we have so far suggests food contamination. We are looking at the possible presence of E. coli in certain hamburger meat at the Morning Glen home. REPORTER (ON TV): Just how dangerous could that be, doctor? Well, obviously, deadly. Thankfully, it appears to be confined. So no connection, then, to the, uh, contaminated strawberries that left several hundred people sick in San Paolo two years ago? A completely different situation. ANNA ORONOZ (ON TV): But tonight, there are disturbing reports of other sick people, including non-Morning-Glen residents showing up at hospitals and clinics around the city. And as yet, we have no definite source for the contamination. This is Anna Oronoz, reporting live, News 4, outside the Morning Glen Home. We saw some of those people in the ER today. They were so sick. They were, uh, cramping, in pain, and begging for water. Whatever it is, I hope they catch it in time. Well, they said it. It's E. coli. I don't know. Remember when we were in Portland, and they had that E. coli contamination? Dairy products. I treated some of those patients. This was-- it was different somehow. Different how? Worse. You should check the water in that place. Hmm? Did you check the water in the, uh, retirement home? Water is always the last thing they think of, you know? No respect. [emergency sirens] REPORTER (ON RADIO): Area hospitals report an unprecedented number of emergency room admissions. Patients are complaining of symptoms that health officials suspect could be food poisoning. However, all meat samples tested so far have been negative. BOB: I think we should test the city water. Susan was at the hospital yesterday. She described the symptoms. It doesn't sound like E. coli. Since when did you become an MD? How are the back T sample results? Normal. Then what would we test for? Well, you tell me. When-- when was the last time you had any water contamination in this area? Two years ago. BOB: And what was that? Cryptosporidium, but that wasn't city water. Some local strawberry grower had a contaminated well. Yeah, the guy on the news mentioned that. The symptoms fit. No, they don't. We didn't have any deaths, just some people with stomach aches. Besides that, our filters take that bug right out. BOB: Lou, it couldn't hurt to test. Let the Health Department do their job. Well, water is our job. You are opening a can of worms. I hope this doesn't have anything to do with what you were saying yesterday. What the hell is that supposed to mean? Questioning the efficiency of this facility in order to prove a point. Is that what you think? I don't know what to think. Right now, that's what it looks like. [eerie music] [phone ringing] I'm Dr. Carver. Bob Miller, senior engineer, Charles Street Water Treatment Plant. What can I do for you? Well, I saw you on TV. And, uh, I have something that I'd like you to run some tests on. Water? We're not set up for it at the plant. Test for what? Cryptosporidium. Come on back. Where were these samples taken? Chavez Reservoir, various locations and depths. It's an impressive, little parasite, cryptosporidium, usually found in farm animals, especially cattle. Spores are released into the environment, rivers, lakes, through waste products. I know. I, uh, reviewed a study of the Milwaukee incident. Then you know what they're looking for is a host, us. They burrow into the cells of the lower intestine and produce more spores. Host cells lose their ability to absorb nutrition, more importantly, water. - You die of thirst. Exactly. Take a look. Is this what I think it is? Yes. So it's in the reservoir? I'd guess in substantial amounts. Well, that's it then. We-- we need to shut down the reservoir till we get it cleared out. And we should test any other local water sources as well. Including tap water. Well, cryptosporidium can't get through the plant's filters. They were designed that way. No, the sample you just looked at was taken from this tap. [phone ringing] - Hello. - Hi. It's me. SUSAN (ON PHONE): Hi. Hi. Uh, listen, hon. Where-- where are the kids? The kids, why? Something's come up. Where-- where are they? Um, Bobby is at Allison's with Rich, and Amelia is still at day camp. What's wrong? Um, we've-- we've got a problem at the, uh, reservoir. I'm about to go into a meeting. I don't have time to explain. But, please, let's just, uh, get them home, all right, as soon as possible. Bob, you're scaring me. And-- and Susan, no water, that means pools, showers, hand, face washing, nothing, nothing liquid that didn't come in a sealed container, OK? You-- you, too. It's 100 degrees outside. Nothing. Well, how bad is it? Bits It's-- it's bad. REPORTER: In this record heat, staying hydrated is the key to getting through your day. Remember to drink at least eight glasses of water. And for those of you trying to escape the heat, shopping-- Hey. Come on in. Where are the boys? I, uh, dropped them at the rec center. Come on. We've got to go now. Why? What's wrong? Come on. Where do you think they could be? Maybe over here. Let's check the pool, over this way. Bobby. Rich. Hey, Mom, watch this. Bobby, no! Wasn't that cool? Did you see that jump? Bobby, get out of the pool. Where are your clothes? - Over-- Then get them, OK? Come on. Let's go, now. We're leaving. But we just-- ALLISON: Rich, come on, you, too. Why do we have to go home so soon? - Come on, man. - Well, can Rich come over? I'm sorry, sweetie. Just get your clothes, OK? We've got to go now. Come on. Let's go. What is with this lousy air conditioning? There must be a half a million faucets in this city. You want to test every one? Just a representative sample to determine the rate of infiltration of the parasite into the system. If any. We already know there's some. The dawn of the 21st century, we can land a glorified golf cart on the moon. Here on Earth, a microscopic bug beats the hell out of us? Mr. Mayor, we have 5 dead and at least 100 sick. We need to get started now, sir. All right, do it fast. Keep it quiet. We don't want a panic. I want results by the end of the day. Bob, can I have a minute? I realize, uh, this is awkward for both of us. But, uh, even so, under the circumstances-- You mean firing me? I still need your best efforts to help us through this crisis. Lou has served this city well and long, and we appreciate that. Believe me. But he doesn't have your stamina. Lou's fine, sir. And I will do my job as long as I have one, always have. Good. I'm counting on you. [music playing] What have you got so far? Red for positive, we're looking at 95% infiltration. So you're saying it's everywhere? Then there's no telling how many people have been exposed. Including us. The cryptosporidium outbreak in Milwaukee several years ago infected over 400,000 people, 100 fatalities. I have contacted the CDC. They're sending in a team. Where did these things come from? We don't know. We will try, of course, to locate a source, but that is not the immediate problem. And why the hell not? You tell me it's in our water delivery system. You don't care where it came from in the first place? We expect the reservoir water to be dirty. That's what water treatment does. It cleans and purifies dirty water. Let-- let me get this straight. This is the reservoir. This is my kitchen. These are the parasites, the water treatment plants. What am I missing here? You're right. The filtration process should have caught it. But it didn't, which means that there is a leak somewhere in the system. Mr. Miller, when we hired you to oversee the construction of the city's new water treatment facility, you told us that the current plant would be good for another six years. I said it could last another six years, at best. That was a warning. It wasn't a boast. What about adding more chlorine at the reservoir? Ineffective, you can add all the chlorine in the world. It'll kill people before it kills cryptosporidium. Will someone please tell me how to stop this thing. Doctor? Boil it. The spores are rendered inactive at boiling temperature. Finally, an answer. Well, our water system services a population of over 300,000 people. Now at 120 gallons per day average summer household consumption, you're looking at 20 to 25 million gallons per day. That's a lot of boiling water. My God. Unless we find and plug this leak, sir, a lot more people are going to get sick. Well, what about the sick? How do we get them well? Ironically, water, clean water, lots of it, you can't kill the parasite in the body. But you can, with patient care, flush it and prevent reinfection. I'll make the announcement. Let me stress again that no water is to be used for either bathing or consumption unless it has been boiled till the crisis has passed. Your local television stations and newspapers will provide daily reminders and additional information on boiling guidelines. Once again, we, uh, regret having to take this action and hope to see the situation remedied soon. Thank you. [shouted questions] REPORTER: And I repeat, you must throw out all food and beverages that could have been prepared with-- REPORTER: More information will follow on the deadly parasite as it becomes clear. REPORTER: Boil all water We have a major crisis on our hands. Right now, you people in the city hate my guts. And I don't like it one bit. Get it the hell out of my water. My water. Mm. I'm not coming out. Get whatever you can. [emergency sirens] Hey, watch it. Yeah, move over. [honking] [shouting] I don't like this. Let's get it over with. We maybe should have gotten here earlier. Things are going to be picked over. Look at this place. Well, we'll just have to take anything we can find with water in it. Everything is gone. Come on. Hi, can we have some of these? Be my guest. OK, thanks. WOMAN: Hey, what's going on over there? Whatever bottled water was out there is already gone. People are hoarding. Can you blame them? What about the aquifer wells in the northwest? Maybe we can get our hands on some of that water. I know a district manager up there. It would take weeks. OK, then the Colorado supply. We don't have the time. In-state sources would be faster. But with the drought, we'd have to wait in line. Besides, we'd have to pass the water through our system and run the risk of reinfection. No, the problem is here. This is where we draw the line. So where do you want to start? I think we should pull the filters. All right, let's do it. [clamoring] Here, my wife, she needs help. - Check in at the desk, please. - Look at her. She needs a doctor now. So does everyone here, sir. She'll be looked at in turn, after you've checked in. Water, please. I'm just so thirsty. I'm-- I'm-- I'm sorry. There's none available at the moment. They have water. - We ran out. - Damn you. What the hell is wrong with you? This is supposed to be a hospital. Sir, please, you need to calm down. Debra, maybe I can help you. OK. Hi. Things are really crazy right now. So maybe I can help you. Um, what-- what's your name? Ellen, Ellen Morgan. OK, uh, Mr. and Mrs. Morgan, listen. We're going to have some drinkable water available to the patients any minute now. Thank you. Can-- can you hold out until then? - Yeah. - OK. I'm sorry about that. Uh, don't worry about it. I understand. If you all can just take a seat right here, and I'll get some water back to you as soon as I can. Thank you. OK? Yeah. WOMAN (ON PA): Dr. Cantino to the ER. Dr. Cantino to the ER. [moaning] Susan. Allison, what are you doing here? It's Rich. He-- he-- he just got so hot. And he just kept asking for more and more to drink. I mean, I boiled the water. I did everything that they said. Uh, where is he? He-- he-- he's with a doctor. I did everything. Of course, you did. Um, how long has he been here? OK, what's the name of the doctor? Um, Conroy. Conrad? Conrad, yeah. OK, uh, I'll go see what I can find. Wait, Susan. Bobby and Rich were in the same pool together. I know. [sobbing] You should have seen him. He was so pale and weak, and he didn't even recognize me. Where's Allison? She's at the hospital still. And, um, I'm going to bring her fresh clothes in the morning. Well, that'll be fine. I should go check on the kids, huh? You just checked on them five minutes ago. They're best friends. They do everything together. Well, that doesn't mean Bobby is going to get sick. That poor baby. Honey, promise me you're going to get some rest, OK? You're exhausted. What I could really use is a hot bath. How about you? I just have a couple minutes. We're getting ready to pull the filters. I wanted to check on the kids. Be careful. I can handle it. They're just kids. I love you. Goodnight, kiddo. Call me Neil. Oh, so you-- you've decided. I'm trying it out. Yeah? Well, it's bed time, Neil. There we go. Did you know Rich is sick? Yeah, I did. He's got that crypto-- Cryptosporidium, yes, I know. Do you think he's going to die? I think he will. Why do you say that? I don't want you to worry. I think Rich will be fine. It's your job to keep the water clean, right? Yes, it is. But, you know, sometimes things happen, no matter what you do. Now it's a problem. And, uh, we're going to solve it. And hopefully Rich will be better soon. What if I get it? Then your mom and I will take care of you, the way we always do, OK? Goodnight, Dad. Goodnight. Do you want to leave the light on tonight? That's OK. I'm not a little kid. Hey, Lou. I'm all set. Let's pull those filters. Mary, I know it's late, but let's try to stay focused. This is mislabelled. No, it's not. How long has this water been boiling? 11 minutes. Tap water? Yes. 45% of the boiled samples still have viable spores. Boiling is not killing it. That's impossible. Heat kills cryptosporidium. Get a sample to the CDC fast. Something's wrong. You're overreacting. This is confirmed. This is not a theory. This is real. Surely-- Mr. Mayor, you have no choice. Turn off the water now. MAN: Sir. Regretfully, it appears that the boiling of water has proven less than completely effective at killing the parasite. [murmuring] Consequently, the city water will be shut off at 1:00 PM today. [angry murmuring] Mr. Mayor, are you saying that even with the boiling, that we were still ingesting this thing all along? County health officials are still investigating the situation in an effort to understand the unique nature of this particular-- [clamoring] Mr. Mayor, how long will the water be off? We are estimating three days, maybe longer. Mr. Mayor-- Now wait. We've made arrangements to have an adequate supply of water trucked in. We're setting up distribution centers, and every resident will be informed how and where they can pick up their water. With proper conservation, we can all get by. Mr. Mayor-- Public buildings and the schools will be closed until the crisis passes. Now we cannot do this without the complete cooperation of the public. JOURNALIST: Mr. Mayor-- REPORTER: Water distribution sites will be open at noon today. On the West Side-- - Mom? What is it, baby? Where's Dad? He's at the plant. I'm thirsty. Can I have something to drink? [dramatic music] OK, here, baby. It feels so hot out. I wish it would rain or something. I know, or something. WOMAN (ON PA): There will be relief efforts to get more drinking water into San Paolo within the next 48 hours. You heard me. Turn 200 CFS down to 0. Just do it. Shut it down. [alarm buzzing] [machinery whirring] [machinery powering down] Well, that's that. Damn it. [sighing] Say hi to Rich for me. I will. I promise. Be good to your babysitter, kids. [cartoon playing] Your filters are full of spores. Good, that means they're working. Not so good, I'd estimate at least half are getting through. Well, the input filters are just the first line of defense. What's next? The charcoal and sand filters. They can't get through that, if they're working right. That was the problem with the Milwaukee contamination. Yeah, I'm not sure this is like Milwaukee. In fact, I'm not sure this is like anything we've ever seen before. Why? The mortality rate in Milwaukee was under a quarter of 1%. We're higher, and seeing an unusually high incidence of what would otherwise be considered low-risk subjects. Such as? Healthy adults, older children, very strange, intriguing. 1, 2, 3, 4. [muttering] Do you have kids, Doctor? No. No, I'm not married. Well, if you do, and your kid's health is threatened, and someone tells you that the disease that threatens them is intriguing, I hope you have the good sense to punch him in the mouth. That's not fair. No? Have you been down to the hospital lately? No, I've been very busy here. Maybe you should go for a little while. You'd realize that, uh, some of the high and low risk subjects you're talking about have names. You've got 6 feet of charcoal and sand in here. I don't care how small that parasite is. It shouldn't get through this. But it is. Lou, the pump's gone out. Can't drain the pond. [groaning] OK, Andy, get me a suit. You've got to be kidding. Well, we need the core sample. [suspenseful music] WOMAN (ON PA): Dr. Provenon to OR, stat. Dr. Provenon to OR, stat. [moaning] No. Oh, God, Allison. He just-- he just didn't have any fight left in him. Oh, my God. You know, his asthma, you know, they said that's probably what-- Shh, don't talk about it now. It happened so fast. I-- I should go with him. - Do you want me to go? No, no, I'm OK. God, my baby. No. [sobbing] Dr. Carver? I'm Carver. Paul Davis, Centers for Disease Control. Bob Miller, water treatment plant engineer. It's tough times for you guys. How are you holding up? Well, we'd, uh, like some answers. We understand you have some. Where can we talk? Uh, the mayor is waiting. He's got the governor on a conference call. Lead the way. WOMAN (ON PHONE): Go ahead. Well, sir, gentlemen, what we've got is a new strain of an old germ, a particularly nasty one. Our lab estimates a survival rate among untreated or insufficiently treated patients at near 50%. We're calling it cryptosporidium C. Remember, that's only an estimate. It's based on a very small sample. The truth is we don't know what it's capable of. Mayor, how is it that the state matched funds to the tune of $15 million for you to build a new water treatment facility two years ago? And what I get instead-- - $15 million? GOVERNOR (ON PHONE): Well, Governor, uh, unfortunately, the water project had to be put on the back burner. Other priorities and contingencies evolved. Spare me the double talk. I have a more difficult decision to make right now. MAYOR (ON PHONE): And what is that, sir? We have reports of the hybrid parasite infecting people as far away as 50 miles from the city, well outside your water delivery system. How many of your residents have already left San Paulo? Thousands since rationing began, and it's accelerating daily. If we don't take steps to stop it, they could spread the infection throughout the entire state. How? Bodily contact. Oh, that's absurd. No, it's not. We shook hands when I came in. If I had it on my hands, you just put it in your mouth. I can't let this thing spread. We have the authority. We're calling in the National Guard to assist with the quarantine. The worst heat wave of the century, we're without water, and now you're locking us up? GOVERNOR (ON PHONE): I've got a major drought, brownouts, a dozen brush fires burning out of control, and state resources taxed to the limit. I can't add a plague to that. You'll get all the medical help and water I can spare. The decision has been made. [dial tone] Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy. Amelia, what is it? AMELIA: What's wrong with Bobby? What? Bobby, what-- honey, what is it? Come here, sweety. - I'm hot, Mom. Oh, you're burning up. Are you OK? So hot. Get the thermometer. I know, sweety. Let me see you. - I'm hot, Mom. - I know. So hot. I know, baby. 104. Oh, God. OK, we get him to the hospital. No, we're getting him out of here. Wha-- where? To my aunt's. San Diego? Yeah, we'll get him to a hospital down there. At least, they'll have water. He'll stand a chance. - What are we gonna do-- You can come or not. I saw Allison's son being wheeled away to the morgue today, OK? I'm not going to let that happen. OK, all right, quarantine goes into effect at midnight. That gives us an hour before the National Guard closes the road. We have time. Come on. Come on, buddy. All right, I'm going to get you there safe, but then I'm gonna have to-- - I know. You're gonna have to come back. Come on. Please, get him to the car. REPORTER: The governor announced that San Paolo will be quarantined. All freeways and surface streets leading into and out of the city will be closed by midnight tonight. In addition, the governor has asked for federal relief and will send in the National Guard to keep peace and distribute bottled water. Hey, buddy. How you doing? I'm thirsty. Here you go, baby. Have as much as you'd like. [horns honking] Stay here. What do you mean, you won't let us through? You can't just come along and block the road. We've got hot people back there. I've got to get my family through. I am sorry, ma'am. The road is closed. - No. No, it's not. We've got a half an hour until midnight. These people have a right to get through here. The deadline has been changed. My orders were to close the road immediately. It's done. REPORTER: Topping our national news at this hour, the quarantined city of San Paolo is continuing to see huge numbers of infected people checking into area hospitals. REPORTER: City officials are dealing with a severe shortage of city and county beds. DR. CARVER: There was a cryptosporidium outbreak in Milwaukee which resulted in over 100 deaths. WOMAN: Doctor, I don't understand why I'm so thirsty. REPORTER: The parasite deprives your body of hydration. The simple explanation is your body is dying of thirst. REPORTER: --any medical work experience to call the emergency placement hotline. REPORTER: The mayor promises that everything is being done to clean the city's water supply as soon as possible. REPORTER: With the closure of all restuarants, bars, and laundromats, San Paolo is beginning to look like a ghost town. REPORTER: The National Guard has called in additional units to aid in the mobilization effort. REPORTER: Sweltering citizens can find no relief. Widespread power outages caused by the overuse of air conditioners are plaguing the city. The authorities are urging home owners to minimize their air conditioner use to half-hour spurts. REPORTER: County officials are asking the public to carefully consider their allotted bottled water. News on the street is that 12 ounces of bottled water can go for as high as $100. SUSAN: His fever is still so high. I need to get more water into him. You should get back to the plant. I just-- I-- I don't want to leave you here alone. I'll be fine. [moaning] Hey. Hey, son. Son, Dad's got to leave for a little while. But Mom's going to stay here with you, OK? I want to go home. I know. Soon, I promise. OK, I'll call you from the plant first chance I get. Love you. So long now. Hey, baby. WOMAN (ON PA): Dr. Stephenson, the municipal samples have arrived and are being held in cold storage. How's your boy? He's hanging in there. Thanks. Yeah. So what am I look at? Well, we add a chemical to the water as it enters here. It acts as a gel. It makes all the particles in the water clump together into chunks. Then the water is filtered through 5 feet of crushed coal and a foot of sand. And out comes clean water. Theoretically. It went through the filters like they weren't even there. Took out barely 10% additional of the spores. I don't believe that. It might be the new strain of this parasite. Or it could be the shape or flexibility of cryptosporidium C. I don't know, but it's worth a detailed study. Oh, that doesn't do us any good now. Damn it. Alum has worked as a flocculating chemical at that plant for 50 years. Wait. You said, alum? I didn't get alum. I got polyaluminum chloride. Yeah, I'm sorry. We switched over about a month ago. Why? Well, it works better. You get less corrosion in the pipes, which means fewer customer complaints. It's tested well all over the country. I-- I actually recommended it. I would like to retest using alum. Are you saying you think that's going to make a difference? What I'm saying is that for 50 years alum seems to have been an effective deterrent. And then a month ago you change, and now we have contamination. I mean, I could check it in the lab. But I don't think it's going to do-- Oh, OK, all right. I'll-- I'll get everything, uh, changed around at the plant. I'll call you when it's ready. You can come down and, uh, take some samples at the source. We're going to switch over immediately, flush the polyaluminum chloride out of the system and switch. There is no reason to believe it'll make any difference. Lou, we're gonna try this, OK? I don't care what the chances are. We're trying it. Your son? Uh, yeah. He's stable. Uh, I know. You work in here, admitting? Well, I did. Um, I'm applying for a transfer to your ward now with you. We don't need administrative personnel. I've been an RN for 10 years. I have advanced certifications in critical care, pediatrics, neonatal, and intensive care. You can check my work history with personnel. Your son's not the only patient on this floor. I know that. I also know that you could use the help up here right now. I'll call personnel. Thanks. Hey. Hi. How's Bobby? He's stable. Bobby's a strong boy. He'll pull through. [engine whirring] Water, It's always just been there. It's not something you worried or even thought about. Hey, buddy, stop. Stop. And now it's everything. Let's go get our water. Stop. Have your IDs ready, two IDs required, two bottles per family. No one will receive water without proper ID. Let's see what you go, all right. Here you go, Susan, one. There's two. And your ID? Oh, wrong street. What? You can't submit your water until the truck reaches your street. - That's ridiculous. SOLDIER: Those are the rules. OK, move aside. Let others in. No, you listen to me. This woman is staying with me in my home, helping me take care of my family. Now a half a block up there, you're going to turn on her street anyway. You checked her off. You've seen her ID. Give her the water. MAN: Let's go. Give her the water, and let's go. Come on. Yeah. Thank you. You're welcome. Next. Come on. Keep it moving. Keep it moving, two IDs. SUSAN: When is this going to end? ALLISON: I'll take these. I'll-- I'll go put them in the fridge. Look what Allison and I made. Is Bobby better? Can I see him? Look at those. Oh, those are beautiful. Is one for me? This one. This one? Now Bobby is, um, he's still sick. You can't see him just yet, though. But he told me to send his love. I bet he didn't. Well, he meant to. Come here. Wait here one sec, OK? Hey. Hi. That's sweet. I used to string beads like this when I was her age. She loved it. Thank you. It was great for her. Thank you. For what? Turning to me for company, I couldn't have faced going back to that empty house. I needed this more than anything. This is for Bobby. I kept it going. It's really pretty simple. I know Rich would want him to have it. I'm sure he'll treasure it. "The kid stared at the glowing metal disk. What is it, said Tracy? It must be some kind of key, answered Tom. He placed the disk in the slot. The wall began to glow, and it slid aside to reveal a long, dark tunnel." Bobby. [clearing throat] Hey. Hey. I feel like I put him here. Of course, you didn't. I'm going to spend a lot more time with him once he's well. You do what you can. I'll call you from the plant. OK, I go back on duty at 6:00. [reporters shouting questions] MAYOR (ON TV): Hold on. Yes, OK, OK, hold on. One at a time, please, one at a time, we'll-- we'll make sure we get to everyone now. Mr. Crawford. Mayor, we are investigating a report that the water treatment plant voted on in the last election was placed on an indefinite hold. Now in light of this current crisis, can you explain why that is? MAYOR (ON TV): Certainly, as you know, the money was raised with the help of matching state funds. Now this office had every intention of proceeding with that project. Unfortunately, the man hired to design and build that new plant has proven unreliable. In fact-- and this is still speculation-- hey may be partially responsible for the pollution problem we are experiencing. REPORTER (ON TV): Mr. Mayor, Mr. Mayor, give us the name. Yeah, what? What? REPORTER (ON TV): Give us the name. Uh, under the circumstances, I don't think that's appropriate, no. REPORTER (ON TV): Is it-- is it-- is it Robert Miller? MAYOR (ON TV): As I said, I don't think that that is appropriate. Mayor, do you deny the man's name is Robert Miller? No. Yeah, Jim? How can he blame you? How can he lie like that? I should have expected. Wait. You knew about this? Wha-- it is a lie, isn't it? I don't know. Maybe not. I can't imagine using the alum instead of polyaluminum chloride will make any difference, but let's keep our fingers crossed. For what it's worth, the mayor is full of it. It doesn't matter. If it works, I don't care what else happens. What then? Get my son well and the others who are sick. That's it, isn't it? That's everything. [beeping] Oh, my God. Bobby. [phone ringing] Miller. Same result, the alum was inconsequential. We're back at square one. OK. No go. Well, at least it gets you off the hook. The hell it does. It's our problem, Lou. It's always been our problem, not the mayor's, not the governor's, not public health's, ours. If we don't solve this, whatever happens, it's our fault. IDs, IDs, show me your IDs. Show me your IDs. Hey, one at a time. One at a time. [music playing] Goddamn it. We need some water down here now. If we don't get some water soon, this whole neighborhood is going up. All right, hang on. Do it. Do it. I need to get the mayor's permission. No, you don't. Listen to me. You open just the sector 8 valves. You keep the rest of the western division shut off. We just need to light up these few hydrants. Lou, Lou, these are people's homes. They would take the risk if it were up to them. We've got to give them that. OK, you'll be wet in five minutes. Open up sector 8, half pressure. Please, get off the street. Return to your homes. It's for your own safety. Let's go. Help us out here. Please, get back. Unbelievable, if the fire doesn't kill you, the water will. [machinery whirring] Oh, my car. FIREMAN: Get back. What the hell is he doing? Get out. What's going on? Captain, I'm losing pressure. We don't have anything. Stay in the car. Do not go in the water. The water is poisoned. Hey. The cell structure of the spores, the flocculation chemicals won't pick it up. Doctor, if you wanted to kill everything in a given area, what would you use? What's the deadliest gas known to man? You mean, one of those nerve gases? No, no, basic-- you run electrical current through oxygen. What do you get? O2 becomes O3, ozone. Here. The new plant was to be built in phases. The last phase, phase 5, was going to incorporate the most advanced concept in water treatment-- ozonation. - Experimental? Somewhat, but it's been tried in locations here and overseas. It works. Now the drawback is it's expensive. But it'll kill anything, I mean, anything it's met so far. It has meant cryptosporidium C. But phase 5, you're-- you're talking about years of development. No, here's all you need-- liquid oxygen, electrical power, lots of it, and an ozone generation tank. Now the first two are easy. The third I can probably get my hands on. But even if you can produce enough ozone in sufficient quantities, how would you get it into the water? I mean, there's a whole delivery system here that doesn't exist. I'm a water engineer. I'll rig something. Dr. Carver, Mr. Miller, Jason Croft, Channel 4 News, a few questions, please. - No comment. Mr. Miller, isn't it true that criticism directed toward you by the mayor has turned out to be unfounded? That doesn't matter. Here's the real question, OK? $15 million, half from the bond issue, half from the state, where is it? Where's the money? Where did it go? Kill it. I think I can answer that. DR. CARVER: Here's your $15 million. That son of a bitch. Mr. Mayor. Where did you get that? Leave, or I'll call security. Fine, just be sure to, uh, tune in to Channel 4 in about a half an hour. Watch their special report, OK? I did nothing wrong. Nothing wrong? Nothing wrong? That money was supposed to be for water. You used it for land development? Which would have brought millions of dollars of revenue into this city, enough to build three water plants. Yeah, except now your precious technology park is going to have to be used as a cemetery, isn't it? You're saying what happened was my fault? Well, you had the power to do something about it, not just listen. What do you want? I want $1 and 1/2 million from your discretionary fund. $1 and 1/2 million? Actually, you know what? Make it $2 million, for ancillary supplies and equipment. Ancillary supplies for what? An ozone generation tank, state of the art, if we act fast, I can pull some strings, steal one on its way to Reno. It'll be trucked in tonight. Ozone generation, why? To do what you told us to do, Mr. Mayor. Get that bug the hell out of your water. OK, this is it. Ozone generator will be parked here. We'll have lines running directly from it into tank 15. Do you think it will hold? Aren't the new holding tanks for ozone generators specially constructed? 3 feet thick with computerized flow pressure and temperature controls. Well, this isn't anything near that. Well, it doesn't have to last for 20 years. It just has to get us by. Look. If we keep an eye on the pressure, it'll hold. It has to. So we bubble the ozone through. We pump it out through perforated PVC. We draw off the top through sealed blowers. What's our water count? Full up, near a million gallons. How much electricity are we talking about to feed the generator? Lots, high amps, we're going to have to come in right off the city grid. And the oxygen? Liquefied, it's easier to work with. Tanker trucks or en route. We're going to need a lot more than 1 million gallons. Hey, we pump it out. We fill it up. We zap it. We pump it out again. We're at 25% capacity in, what, one day? Short term, the city could live with that, Lou. Without it, it can't live at all. It'll be ugly. We'll have to watch it the whole time, but it'll work. Well, I hate to be the voice of doom and gloom. But what if everything goes as planned, and the bug is still there? Ozone killed cryptosporidium C in the lab. This isn't the lab. I know. Lou, it'll work. It will work. [horn honking] Hi, honey. Hi. I was reading to him, and he mumbled something. He wanted a drink. - Yeah? Yeah. Hi, Dad. Hi, yourself. BOBBY: Hi, Mom. SUSAN: Hi, sweety. I was dreaming. And I can't remember. SUSAN: Shh, don't strain yourself. I'm tired. Well, that's OK. You just keep resting, OK? I, uh, I really only had a minute. It's OK. Go. He's gonna make it. Hey, how are things going down there? Well, I don't want to jinx anything. But, uh, I think we have a chance. OK. [music playing] OK, let's go. It's bigger than I thought it was. It looks so nice. It's very solid there. BOB: OK, Eddie, let's go. Watch it. Pick up the slack there. MAN: Great, guys. [cable snapping] Hey, hey, hey. Watch it. OK, OK, all right, I got it. I got it. I got it. MAN: Hold the line. Come on. Watch out. Watch out. Get back here. Get back. MAN: Come on, OK. BOB: OK, all right, over here, over here. I got it. I got it. Back out. Ow. OK, bring it down. Bring it on down, guys, easy, easy. Slowly, slowly, you OK? Ow. No, no, no, easy, Paul, are you OK? PAUL: Yeah, got the air knocked out of me. All right, good. You all right? MAN: All right, come on. Let's hook it up. - Yeah, it looks good. - Pull it off. Get him down from there. What the hell happened? You all right, Paul? PAUL: It's OK. I just got the wind knocked out of me. BOB: OK, let's do this. Good here. LOU: Your team check all the lines. We're ready. LOU: Make sure they're ready to go. Get back to me. Lou? Yeah, we're good to go. OK, what's the pressure over there now, Andy? 125 PSI. All right, we're gonna power up on three, OK? One, two, three. [machinery whirring] It's working. Clean over here, there's no leaks. LOU: Golly, you did it. What have you got now, Andy? Still 125. I'm getting something different. Keep an eye on the board. Watch this. Watch it. Keep the line clear. Looks solid. It's coming in too slow. We're getting back pressure into the generator. Tank valve, Andy. Andy. Come on, guys. It looks OK. No, no, no, no, there's too much pressure. This valve isn't open all the way. Help me. Help me. It's open. No, no, no, feel it. How old are those valves? We've got to shut the system down. No, no, no, there isn't time. Help me. Help me. Help me. Keep trying. Keep trying. Move. Get out of the way. Get out of the way. No. No, if it ruptures and the gas gets out, we're all dead. If I don't do something, it's going to blow anyway. Get out of here. Clear everyone out. Go. Go. Clear 'em out. - OK, move it, out of here. Clear it out. All right, hey, get back over here. Clear out of the way. MAN: Get it? MAN: I don't know. BOB: Got it. MAN: What's it got? Watch yourself. MAN: It worked. What, uh, what if it doesn't? I've got a brother-in-law who manages a car dealership in Phoenix. Maybe he could use a couple of extra salesmen. I hate that guy. Gentlemen, I'd like to propose a toast. Yes, yes. LOU: Way to go, Andy. Aw, man. Congratulations, Mary. Good work. Fine work. Good work. Hey. [laughter] Look at that. Whoa. Huh? [laughter] Woo. Woo. The system will be fully pressurized by noon today. Now we ask that everyone allow their water to run a full six hours so that the spores will be fully flushed out. Do not use or touch the water during this time. Now I want to stress that we are still dealing with a very severe water shortage. And this is only a temporary solution, until the new plant gets built. Mayor, when will the city begin building the new water treatment plant? Right away, now that the funds have been made available, and we've got the right man for the job. [joyful music] BOB: What a view. Pretty nice up here, huh? BOBBY: Not bad. BOB: Yeah, did you adjust those afterburners? No, there we go. BOB: And did you get a reading on those compass headings, Mr. Armstrong? There you go, Dad. You know something, Dad? I think I'm going to still be Bobby Miller. Why is that, because you-- you couldn't be any prouder of your old man, if he was an astronaut that walked on the moon? No, if I was Armstrong, I'd have to sit in the front of the class all the time. BOB: Hey. BOBBY: Hey, hey, stop that. BOB: Get her. Go get her. Stop her. Stop her. Danger. SUSAN: All right, all right. Hey, want a beer? Yes, thank you. Or maybe you just want a little water? No, thanks. Do you think, maybe, just a little? No, please, honey, stop it. No. Come here, you little kids. [music playing] Get her. Go get her. Hey. SUSAN: Come back here, you little munchkins. BOBBY: Mom, stop. SUSAN: I'll get you. BOBBY: Mom. [music playing] And cut. [music playing]
