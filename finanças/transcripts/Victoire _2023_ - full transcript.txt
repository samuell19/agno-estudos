While some characters from the Dufresne family did exist, our story is the product of a fictional novel. VICTOIRE Are you all right, darling? Yes. I just need to lie down. - Shall I call the doctor? - Yes! No. No doctor. Thomas, I have cancer. What can the doctor do? Alexandrine, I don't want to see any tears. You have a meeting, Thomas. Go on. Oscar! Come have a seat. You have many good days ahead of you. About two months. You're strong, Mom… stronger than all of us. Yes. I have something to ask of you. I know you're busy. Whatever you need. I have matters to settle in Pointe-du-Lac. I need you to accompany me, two or three days. I don't know, given your health. My health is the reason I must go. I'll explain later. Go on. Jo! Can you stop? This is where I first spoke to your grandfather. GENERAL STORE My father was furious that day. I had just been kicked out of boarding school. Victoire… If the school benches are too much for you, you can at least carry wood. Hello, Mr. Du Sault! How are you? Top shape. He's feeling a tad nostalgic. Oh yeah? So it's done? We just signed. Mr. Garceau takes possession in two weeks. I'm sure you have a heavy heart, Georges-Noël, but think about the price I paid. That should cheer you up. Now, you coming from a wedding or a funeral? A meeting at my daughter's school. Jo's ready with your order. The lovely Victoire isn't in school? No, the lovely Victoire isn't in school. I'll take some tobacco too. Are you OK? Let me give you a hand. Thank you. Between neighbors. Your dad didn't tell you? I know he's repairing your mother's house. No, my house. I bought my mother's farm. We move in in two weeks. You get prettier each year. Mr. Dufresne. Mom… A four-hour train ride, an hour on the carriage… We're alone now. Why are we here? The girls' ribbon shoes, how many did you sell last year? I'm not sure. About 25,000 pairs. Right here. This is where I created them. This is where it all started? No. It was there, in the barn, that I made my first shoes. With your great-grandfather's tools. In secret. Things were never easy between my father and me. Especially not then. There you are. I'm warning you, I don't approve of what you did. Maybe not, but I know you understand. Victoire, no, I agree with your father. Look at this. It'll change your mind. I'm serious. You have no idea how much pain you cause him. He sacrificed so much to send you to the best school. I didn't ask for any of it. Don't be ungrateful. You have to finish your studies. But I'm not happy at the convent. I'm suffocating! I don't want to go back there. I'll have you know I got kicked out on purpose. Don't ever tell your father. That's when I understood you can't count on anyone. You have to go after what you want, no matter what it takes. I can't explain why, but when the Dufresne family arrived, it filled a void, a loneliness I had always felt here. Easy there, easy! Easy! Here. Thank you. Are you feeling better today? Don't stop. You did this? I have plenty of other models if you want to see. It's too nice. What do you mean? People around here want a sturdy pair of shoes. They're not looking for a fantasy. They're not everyday shoes. They're for special occasions. We didn't send you to the convent to doodle. They're not doodles. Call them what you will, but it takes more than drawings to succeed. A smart girl like you can't spend her life making booties! That's not my intention. I want to create something new. With the schooling I paid for, I expect you to do something honorable. Making shoes isn't honorable? Not when you've studied to do more. You made me go to the convent! I never asked for that. You will complete your studies! Look, Mother Superior is willing to give you another chance. All she asks is that you read this to the class. Never. And if you can't accept my choices, that's too bad. There you are! One hole in the fence, and that devil gets out. His name's Storm. This is his father, Eagle. They're from Massachusetts. Just how I like them: hot-blooded and stubborn. You two seem to get along. Here, tie him up to see. Are you busy? I'd like you to meet my wife. I'm not presentable. We're not going to Sunday mass. Hop on! You all right? Look at this. It looks good. Not bad, huh? Sweetie! You remember little Victoire Du Sault? Yes. - Victoire, my wife, Domitille. - Hello. Sorry, I hurt myself. My wife is an artist. Come see. It's beautiful. It's not done yet. This is my eldest, Thomas, and his brother, Ferdinand. Their spitting image. They will be home from school soon. You can meet them. You're not in school? No. That's over for me. I draw too. Not as well as you, but… What do you draw? Shoes. I want to open my own shop. That's a strange job for a woman. I disagree. Goodbye! Goodbye. Mom? Mom! We're at 65 cents, gentlemen! Treat your hens to this nice, vigorous rooster! 65 cents, Rémi Du Sault! We're up to 70 cents! 70 cents, anyone? Yes. Oh! Ubald in the lead! 70 cents! Who can beat 70 cents? We can't go higher. 70 cents going twice! 70 cents going three times! Congratulations, Ubald! The rooster is yours! Yes! Next up, we're auctioning two little piglets. Plump, well-raised… Yes? I made them. Size 7. Really? Ladies and gentlemen, this is unheard of! A pair of women's booties made by a woman! Here today, the lovely Victoire Du Sault! - Hello, ma'am! - $1.50. We'll start at $1.50. Size 7. Not 6, not 8. Size 7. Look at the craftsmanship! Aren't these darling? And the leather, soft as can be. $1.50! Look at how beautiful they are! $1.50! Does anyone have $1.50 for the lovely Victoire's booties? Miss Victoire, what do we do? Lower the price. After much discussion, we'll lower the price to $1.25. Now, who wants to treat themselves? I'll buy them for you. No thanks. They're your size. I'll buy them. I don't want them. Gentlemen, if your wife wears a size 7, it's your chance to treat her! Look at how soft, how supple, how fine the leather! The elegance of these women's booties! Look at these buckles! Are they booties or Christmas trees? Now that's an excellent idea! Imagine your wife arriving at church for Midnight Mass in these elegant booties! What are you doing? Let go of me, or I'll throw a fit. Miss! I think your booties are beautiful. I'm Thomas, Georges-Noël's son. My father says you're talented and brave. He said that? Yes. And I think so too. Thomas? Victoire! Come, Thomas. Victoire! I'll buy your booties, $1.50. I don't need charity. It's not charity. My uncle has a shop in Trois-Rivières. I know I'll make a profit. No. Pay me when they sell. Suits me. There you are! I was worried. I don't want to see him. Don't talk about your father that way. I'm not in the mood to be criticized. The entire village just did, and that's enough. There you are. It's about time. Dad, don't start, please. If it's not too much to ask… tell me where to set up your workbench. Come. Go on! I thought we'd put it here, by the window. What do you think? You know, Victoire… it's clear that no matter what I do, you won't go back to school. You're more hard-headed than I thought. It's just as well. Because you'll need it. Those bastards won't ever laugh at my daughter again. What he gave me was more than a workshop. It was strength, courage, confidence. What still drives you and your brothers today. Thomas, Ferdinand, come! Come! Victoire? You have visitors. Thomas. Hello! Hello! I'm here to settle my debts. Your booties flew off the shelf at my uncle's shop, $2.25. Your $1.50. - The rest is my profit. - Thank you. He says he'll rearrange part of his store to display your merchandise. Thomas, jeez! It's fine. They'll need shoes for school. Would a 75-cent advance work for you? I don't know how to thank you. Don't make them too tight. Their feet grow faster than their hair these days. OK, barefoot, you two! Let's measure those skiffs of yours. Are you sure you don't want to come in? It's chilly. The fresh air is good for me. I've thought about it. I don't want to talk about your past. It's your business, not mine. Oh, Oscar… Domitille's health was deteriorating. They had to leave the children with an aunt in the village. My mother made them meals to help. It's not rest. It's not care or sleep, it's time. It's time with you that I need. I'll give you as much as you want. Why do you look after that girl when I need you? Domitille, really! Ferdinand told me all about the plans for your uncle's shop! You know me. When I see someone with potential, I encourage them. Just tell me what you want and what you don't! I want to move back to the village. We can't spend our time moving, especially given your state. I promise I'll consider it. But you need to get your strength back. Go. I don't want your pity. Go on. You only have eyes for her. Go find her. Sorry. I don't know what I'm saying. I'm afraid of losing you. I love you. Can't you see? Victoire? We can't count on my uncle anymore. The family's fate was sealed that fall. Your grandfather had spent the afternoon on business in the village. When he came home at the end of the day, the little journal was there, resting in Domitille's hands, as if she had planned it. A little journal that would change our lives forever. Well, well! Hi, Jo! I have the money for your father to fix the roof. Tell him Jo will look after the horses for the next months. The next months? Yes. I'm going to Trois-Rivières. I need… I need a change of scenery. You've hardly eaten or slept all month. You won't last long like this. And you can't just make booties. You have to sell a few once in a while. Thanks for reminding me. I'm going door-to-door starting tomorrow. I'll sell some. Watch me. Good. Remember to be polite. And smile! Yes, just like your father. I guarantee you won't find more sturdy or comfortable boots. The price is negotiable. You've got a hard head, I'll give you that. It's not a job for little girls. Is that a law somewhere? The law of common sense. It takes a strong pair of hands to work leather and make solid boots. That's right. Try to rip off the sole. I have better things to do. You don't seem to think it'll take too long. Go on, Ubald! I'm warning you, I won't pay for repairs. Go on, Ubald! - Come on, Ubald! - Come on! Instead of two, I put three stitches around the sole. Seems better. Oh, and I sew it all on the inside so it doesn't show. I think it's nicer. Opening offer, $1.25 a pair. I don't need boots. You, Euchariste? Mine are indestructible. At that price… Give me that! Not easy to change their mind, is it? These look like your size. Try them on. I'll give them to you. If you like them, spread the word. - Are you sure? - More than sure. It's not the shoes they don't like. It's that they're made by a woman. They're too narrow-minded. A woman shoemaker, you know… That's right, a woman shoemaker. Do you have a problem with that? Jo! Damn Storm kicked me! Are you crazy? Let go of me! Victoire! Get out of there! Come help! Calm down! Come, Storm. We have to go. A blanket! OK, come on, Storm. Let's go! Come, Storm! Come! Come on. My love… My great love, my only love. Because I cannot live without your love, because I cannot imprison you in my love any longer, I pray death will come and free us. I want you to bless it with me the day it comes, even if it tears me away from my sons. Although no one could love you as much as me, I give you to the one who stole you from me, the one who's waiting. The one who stole your heart. Victoire? It seems I owe you one. I was awake. I heard your horses. It was a coincidence. Yes. Jo told me. What you did was madness. I want to thank you. You and Storm get along well. Well, he's yours. Thank you, but I can't accept. If it wasn't for you, he would have burned with the others. I can't. That's all. You… If anything had happened to you… I thought of you in Trois-Rivières. Often. What are we doing? Nothing wrong, as far as I know. My uncle will take all the shoes you can provide. Although no one could love you as much as me, I give you to the one whole stole you from me, the one who's waiting. The one who stole your heart. Dufresne's uncle is ambitious to think he can sell all that. Someone finally believes in me. We won't stop him. Me, your mother and the neighbor don't count? That's not what I meant. Speaking of the neighbor, he said to let him know if you change your mind about Storm. Shouldn't turn down a nice beast like that. Don't forget my ribbons! Yep. I'll get going if I want to be back before dark. OK. Safe travels! Go, go! You're here to get Storm? Have you read it? Domitille was sick when she wrote that. And the drawings? It was all in her head. It wasn't true. No? Of course not. Well, I can tell you I loved you like crazy. Not a night went by I didn't think of you, not even… Not even the night of her death. I don't want anyone to know about us. No one. Especially not your sons. They're not ready. You have my word. I'm sure it comes as a shock now. Remember that back then, he wasn't your grandfather or my father-in-law. And Dad? He can never find out. Never. And you had to tell me? I'm cold. Come eat a little. Even that is starting to be too much effort. It lasted a few years. No one knew. What do you want for your birthday? I told you I wanted you to let me give you something. That's not how things are usually done. Your smile when you see what's inside, that will be my gift. You've told me for years you're tired of keeping us secret. That you want us to live together, travel together. Be seen together. I want all of that too, my love. I'm ready. Save them for the day you propose to me. I'd marry you tonight, my love. It's a bit late. Maybe tomorrow? Victoire… Ferdinand came home from school early. Tell him. And Thomas too. They're old enough to understand. He's very sick. We don't know if he'll make it. I don't think it's a good time to tell him about us. That's why we're here? You're not sleeping? Tell me about your night. Nothing special. Dinner with an old friend. With her. Victoire Du Sault. I was planning to tell you both at the end of the school year. Don't you want me to be happy? Not with her. Mom doesn't deserve that. She suffered so much. I swear, Victoire and I never did anything wrong. I respected your mother. I loved her. Georges-Noël and I continued our relationship, far from prying eyes. But something had changed between us. It was fractured, I'd say. What are you doing? The tannery is going to close. It's Garceau. You know how he is. Never stops blabbering on. Are you OK? Yes, I'm fine. No, it's too heavy. I'm helping you. - Thomas! - Yes, who else? You never stop growing! And you never change, not a hair. How are you, Mr. Du Sault? Not bad for an old invalid. You? How was school? Glad it's over. Well, thank you. We'll be going. Seems we're late. Hang on a minute. Wasn't it your birthday? Yes. They say it cuts soles like butter. You're too kind. Thank you! See you soon. I found work. You could have told me. So you could tell me I had to stay in school? No, I'd have told you to be wary of Garceau. Ask Jo Milo. Thirty-five years at the store, and he was fired just like that. Garceau gave his job to Ovide, a good-for-nothing simpleton. Ovide is all right. My mother made you this. After boarding school, some real food. Load me up. Leave some for his brother. Don't worry, I'm watching her. Smells good in here. Good enough to wake the dead. I'll bring you a plate. When we have such a lovely visitor? Come. Mrs. Du Sault is some cook! Reminds me of when my mom was sick, and you brought us meals. It's strange to see you there. That was her seat. My mother's, I mean. I can move if you want. A chair is a chair. We're not gonna frame it and hang it on the wall. What's going on? Your brother is with the doctor. He had an episode. He's having trouble breathing. What's the priest doing here? Ferdinand needs calm. With his hard head, he'll pull through. I couldn't give him the Eucharist. He can't swallow. He's not there yet! Father, I'll see you home. Thank you. Hang on with everything you've got. Tell me you won't give up. I'll give you anything you want, Son. But promise me you'll fight and not give up. What I want… Let go of me! Why are you doing this? Why? What was fractured between Georges-Noël and I broke that night. As if destiny dealt its final blow to our love. I dream about her every night. She's driving me crazy. What are you waiting for? Do something! My father caught me watching her. I feel like he won't approve. Since when do you wait for permission? This is different. The look he gave me… I don't know. Maybe he thinks she's too old for you. She could almost be your mother. Although she looks good for her age. Stop messing around and work. With women, it's simple. You have to be direct. Find one you like? Bing! Kiss her, just like that. Then, either it's love, or a slap in the face. But at least you know. Have you ever tried? Are you crazy? You're OK? Keep going? Yes. Don't tire him out. Don't worry. My brother is strong, you'll see. Should we do another lap? Enough. Thomas, the chair. You OK? How are you feeling? You won't believe it, but I think I'm hungry. Well, well! We're gonna feed you, buddy! I know he was very sick. Still, I swear he was playing it up just to push me away. Thomas! I know, I'm late. It won't happen again, Mr. Garceau. I just wanted to tell you that since you started here, business has increased 30%. I'm happy. And… Lamothe is getting on in years. He's not bringing in as much as he used to. I might need a… a new chief of operations before long. Here. You have five trips today. Start with the lumber delivery at the mill. We won't be done before dark. Ovide? You OK? You OK? Wait. Wait! Thomas? Are you OK? You're hurt! It was a partridge hunter. I've never seen horses take off like that. Are you OK? Yes. You're beautiful. Don't be upset. I just wanted to know. I've loved you since I was little. I love you. You have no idea. Aren't you moving a bit fast? I know her better than any other woman. I love her. I adore her, Dad. I'm just asking you to wait a bit. Until… Until you're sure. Sure about what? My feelings for him are as strong as anything I've ever known. You're just starting out in life. Garceau is making me chief of operations. Isn't 17 a bit young to know what you want? Maybe, but I'm 27. I won't let love slip through my fingers again. I know you wouldn't do something so serious just to get back at me. I love him. Well, I hope you're happy together. You'll see, Dad. The more you know her, the more you'll love my Victoire. We were married the following summer. Georges-Noël insisted on offering the rings. I tried telling him I didn't want any. He told me it was the way things were done. It was the only time he raised his voice with me. I know what you're thinking. A lot of things, to be frank. On my wedding day, I still had feelings for your grandfather. But I knew it was over between us. I loved your father very much. I knew I had to spend my life with Thomas. Live with him, start a fam-- I don't know where you're going with this. I should never have brought you here. We're here so that you know. I'm exhausted, Oscar. I need to shed the burden of lies before I die. Whatever happened in the past… I love you. We all love you. Nothing can change that. What are you doing there? You should have waited for me to come down. I made breakfast. I'm not hungry. The train isn't until 4:00. Good. I have more to tell you. Please, let's not talk about it. Your father and I planned to move to the cottage following renovations. - Mom… - But the work wasn't advancing. So finally, we ended up here. If I had known I'd spend the next 15 years here… I'll go pack your bags. Oscar… This is the last thing I ask of you, my last wish. Oscar! Oscar? Oscar! Oscar! Oscar, Mom told you not to come in here. It's the first time I've seen you here. Come, Oscar. You're welcome. Make yourself at home. As my father would say, our house is your house. Come, Oscar. I'm not feeling well. Mom! Mom? Mom, are you all right? My water broke. Get him out of here. Come, Oscar. I'll get Mrs. Houle! No! There's no time. - Your mother? - No, she's in the village! Go get scissors and thread. Are my stuffing bags ready? Of course they are. Joachim! Mr. Gélinas' order. I'll need a dozen 2x4s too. How's the lovely Victoire? - Thomas! - She just had a boy. Come here. Ovide! Take over the counter a minute. A dozen 2x4s for Mr. Gélinas. I have some bad news. My boy's sawmill caught fire, and… him and his three sons are in dire straights. If there's anything I can do… Come sit. We should talk. Before we eat, let's raise a glass to my stallion, who won first place at the regional fair. And to Ferdinand… who starts school next week. And especially to our spirited little Candide, the newest member of our family. Sure, congratulations. Everyone is moving forward but me. Garceau's son's sawmill burned down, so he gave him my job. Said it was too bad, but family comes first. Same can't be said around here. If you have something to say to me, say it. If you hadn't sold the shop, I wouldn't be in this situation. He sold it for Mom. Out of love. Where'd you hear that? It was to be closer to her when she got sick. What are you going to do? Flour salesman. Garceau offered me a job as a travelling salesman. I start in two months. You accepted it? Do you have a better idea? You'll be gone for long stretches. You can't leave me alone with two kids and the shop. You're not alone. My father is here. Your father left on the coldest day of the year for three long months. He should sleep a while. Thank you. It was like the house was getting smaller each day, like the walls wanted to push us closer together. Mom! Mom! I'll go. Mom… He needs to get up and drink water, or he won't last the night. Easy, Eagle. Let's get him up. Grab his tail. Go on, Eagle. Good job, Eagle. Good job, Eagle. Good job. Easy… Easy… Hold him here. Let's just hope it's not a twisted intestine. You wouldn't do that, huh, Eagle? Hold him like this. Easy. We'll intubate him. Easy… Come on. That's it. Easy… Yes, easy. May I come in? Yes. After that night, we were afraid of one another, as though we had a contagious disease. We hardly spoke. We barely looked at each other. Thomas… At last! Look what the little flour salesman brought home! I've never made so much money. I sold everything. Just easy orders. Garceau is going to fall on his ass! You missed me, huh? I'm sorry. I want you too, but I can't. I have to go. But you just got here! The children! They're at my mother's. I have one more client to see in Yamachiche. Don't make that face. I went out of my way to come show you this. Thomas! I love you. What's going on? My husband is leaving. Again. I'm sorry about this morning. I want you so badly. I thought about you every night. So much it kept me up all night, sometimes. I love you. I love you. Georges-Noël spent the next few months deep in the woods, hoping to be forgotten. Why are you telling me this? It's none of my business. You won, Victoire. I thought you'd be proud. No, you won. It's your name on my shoes. Your name. I swear, I had no choice. The French are worse than us! A female shoemaker is unimaginable there. You should have asked. You would have said no. It'll open up markets across the Atlantic! More of your big ideas… That's right. I learned it all from you. Now, excuse me. I have a lot to do before leaving for Montreal. You're leaving again? I didn't tell you? No. Oscar's birthday is in two days. Already… We'll celebrate when I'm back. You're always away. We never see each other! What are you chasing after? I've had enough of Pointe-du-Lac! I'm not well here. I dream of the day we pack our bags for good. Thanks for telling me. This trip has nothing to do with that. "Hello, brother. I've gotten married. You must meet my wife, Georgiana. "Urgent. Don't tell anyone. Ferdinand." It's strange. It's Ferdinand. It's normal. CERTIFICATE OF HONOR If your grandma doesn't make the best cake in the world, I don't know who does. Nothing is too good for you, my boy. Happy birthday. He started doing that a while ago. He falls asleep. And last week… I won't tell you where, though! Why is Dad always gone? He works hard to give you everything you need. I know he forgot about me. If he forgot about you, he wouldn't have gotten you a gift. Want to go see it? Yes! Into my arms. Come, there's a gift! Careful… Open your eyes. That's for me? That's what Thomas told us, anyway. You didn't get me anything, Grandpa? Oscar… I didn't get you anything? These little ponies don't come with a saddle. Want to go for a ride? Are you comfortable? You like it? Yeah! Georgiana? Thomas Dufresne. Welcome to the family. Who's this little package? Your niece, Délima. I was afraid I'd never see you again. You've always had your secrets. Dad… How is he? Top shape. I'm sure he'd want to be here now. Not me. I've made him suffer enough already. Come on, Ferdinand. Don't say that. There are things you don't know. And it's better that way. Tell Dad I don't judge him anymore. That I understand now. Telling you what came next is the hardest thing I've ever done. Why is it like this? It's so strong. It's like a fire inside me. It's tearing me apart. I'm not strong enough. I'm going to bed. The night of your birthday… was the last time. The time too many. The reason I have to tell you this now. The reason why I'll never rest in peace. Dad, we have something to tell you. Last week, Victoire and I signed an offer to purchase. Don't tell me you're buying the general store. In Montreal. We've decided to take the plunge. We're building a shoe factory, a big one. Very big. We're moving next year. It goes without saying you're welcome to come with us. Honestly, I'm not surprised. I just wondered when it would happen. Pointe-du-Lac, Yamachiche… Much too small for you two. Words can't express how much I admire you, Thomas. I wish I could live another 20 years to see everything you will have accomplished by then. But I belong here. Isn't it time I let you live with your husband in peace? I won't be able to handle being apart. Neither will you. Thomas gave you four beautiful children. You belong with him. And him alone. Three beautiful children. Marius… You belong with us. Kids? We're going in. Georges-Noël? Georges! Oscar, tell Dad to get the doctor! Quick! Marius, come here, sweetie. Hold Grandpa's hand. Like this, gently. Georges, Marius is here. That's his little hand in yours. It's Marius! Georges! Dad? Dad, we're here. Georges-Noël? A year before we married, my dad caught me spying on you. I'll never forget the look he gave me that night. Like he was begging me not to ruin his life. And not to ruin mine. That night, I understood you two had a sacred bond. Despite everything, I decided to marry you. You've always been the only woman for me. For better or for worse. Everything I do, Victoire… the work, the money… the projects… the big plans for Montreal… all of it… is to deserve you as much as him. Do you love me? To me, that's all that matters. I never want to talk about this again. My dear Oscar, if you only knew how much I wanted to spare you these confessions. But if the years taught me anything, it's that the weight of the lie crushes all those who carry it. Only the truth can set you free. Marius must know who he is and where he comes from, but not during your father's lifetime. He's suffered enough. He deserves what I can never have: to end his days at peace. Since I won't survive him, I'm passing this terrible secret on to you. You're strong. You'll know what to do. I love you. I ask forgiveness before you and the Lord. Your mother. Our mother was an incredible woman. I envy you for having spent time alone with her. Yesterday, we ate together. She was acting strange. She told me I was special. She told me to take care of you. Marius… Dad is the one who needs us now. I'll be there soon. Translation by Elisabeth Gillies Subtitles by MELS
