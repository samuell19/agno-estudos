[♪♪♪] [GRUNTS] [SCOFFS] Whew, it's hot in here. Ah, what a stubborn spot. LARRY: Shemp, give me a hand, will you? I can't now. I gotta finish my pants. MOE: Hey, fellas. Listen to this letter. "Gentlemen..." That ain't for us. We're not gentlemen. Speak for yourself. Ooh! "Gentlemen, this is to inform you "that unless overdue payments for tailoring equipment "are made within 24 hours, "we will repossess said equipment. "Balance now due: $321.86. "Skin and Flint Finance Corporation. I, Fleecem, President." They'll put us out of business. What'll we do? You guys worry about that. I'm too young to worry and get wrinkles on my pretty little face. What we need is a little music to cheer us up. [STATIC CRACKLING] ANNOUNCER: News flashes. Police are frantically scouring the town in search of Terry "Slippery Finger" Hargen. Hargen has robbed his 18th consecutive safe in nine days. A large reward is offered for his capture. Does your car have indigestion? Does it burp in the morning? Try 'No-burpaline', the only gasoline containing bicarbonate of soda... [TURNS RADIO OFF] Hey, Moe, why don't we capture Hargen and collect the reward? Then we can pay our bills. Oh, it's as simple as all that? Hargen is gonna walk right in here and let you capture him. You're nuts. We're gonna be paupers. Paupers. Are you kidding? We're not even married. Oh. Why don't you be quiet. Oh. Think. I can't think when I'm hungry. [SPITTING] Oh, a funny man. What's the matter with you? What did I do? Who wants lunch? LARRY: I do. SHEMP: Make me some too, will you? Okay, coming up. [SIZZLING] [LOUD HISSING, AIR EXPLODING] Ah, boy. [WHIMPERS] Ah. [LAUGHING] Ah, well, here we are. [MUMBLING, LAUGHING] What are you stalling around for? [NOSE CRUNCHES] Oh, oh, oh, oh. You know, you got a rush order to get out. Get Mr. Grant's pants and hand-press them. All right, all right. But where are they? I pinned them up on the shade. What'd you do with them? I didn't touch them. Uh-oh. Here. Hurry up and press those. What are you standing around for? [WHIMPERING] [GROWLS] [CHUCKLING] [GRUNTS] [SIZZLES] Oh! Oh, oh! [SPITTING] [GRUNTING] Oh. [YELLING] Oh, oh, oh. [GROANING] [GROWLS] You double-crosser. Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh, oh, oh! [GROWLING] [BARKS] Wise guy, this time I'll close you. Oh! I'm sorry, Moe. Oh, think nothing of it. Oh, gee, thanks. You're welcome. Oh! [YELLING] Oh! Ow! What's the idea? I'm sorry. You stepped into me. Hey, fellas. A customer. Say, have you seen...? MOE: Yes, sir. LARRY: Don't worry about it. You've come to the right place. You bet. This is the store where your dollars have more sense. Say, we've got the very sport coat you're looking for. I don't want a coat. But listen, mister, we're gonna give you a bargain. Where did you ever get this mess? I bought it here. Oh, what a beautiful masterpiece. SHEMP: Now, just relax, mister. They'll only be a second. Yeah... Here. Isn't it a beauty? Genuine import. Smell the ocean. And it's 200 percent wool. Two hundred percent? These sheep led a double life. Yes, sir. Get it on. [LAUGHING] Get it right in there. I don't want... Will you...? There you are. There you are. I don't want a coat. I don't want a coat. I don't want a coat! STOOGES: Oh, he don't want a coat. What he wants is a pair of our slick slacks. Why didn't you tell me the man wants slacks? Get him slacks. Go ahead! I don't want any slacks... All right, look. Now, look, bud, in this store, the customer's always right. SHEMP: We want you to be happy. MOE: Yeah, take it easy. It won't be but a minute. You don't have to buy anything you don't want. Nothing. Just buy what we tell you. Here you are, brother. Slick slacks. Try them on for size. Oh, yes, try them right on. We can... Oh... Gee, officer, we didn't... Quiet! You birds realize you just let Terry Hargen, the bank robber, slip right through my hands? I ought to run you in. Please, officer, I got six wives and two kids. Honest, officer, there was nobody came in here. Well, he's in the neighborhood. Keep a sharp lookout. I'll be back. Right. Right. Oh. Hey, fellas. What is it? Look what I found in the pocket of these pants. [MOE READING ON-SCREEN TEXT] This is the combination to a safe. "T.H." I wonder what that means? Teddy Hoosevelt? You're wrong, quiz kid. I got it. I got it. SHEMP: Who? Thomas Hedison. Why don't you dumbbells stop. Thomas Hedison, Teddy Hoosevelt. Terry Hargen. Terry Hargen, the bank bandit. He was here. These are his clothes. And this safe combination... This must belong to a safe he's gonna rob. Hey, we'd better call the cop back. Now, don't be hasty. Hargen might come back here after his clothes and then we nab him and collect the reward ourselves. That's what I said before, but you said to me... [CRUNCHES] Ow! Ow! I ought to razor-blade you. Wait a minute. Let me see that razor blade. Certainly. Well. No, no! Don't cut those! Don't cut...! Look what you did. Now my hat won't fit me. Don't worry. I'll get it back. [SOBBING] Oh. Oh, never mind. I won't wear a hat. Oh, go on, you guys, get busy. Get on those pants. All right. You too. LARRY: All right. Hm. Hiya, fellas. Is my coat altered? Just finished. Oh, fine. Try it on. Good. There you are. Wait a minute. Here, brush him off. Sleeves 31 inches. How's that? That's right, 31. [BRUSHING] Who made that hat? My mother. I thought so. There you are. You're all set. Right. Well, see you on payday. Right. What's the idea of wrecking that man's coat? He had a loose baste. I'll loose baste you. SHEMP: Oh, no, Moe. Why you... Moolah. Hey, fellas. I just found 50 bucks in that coat. Maybe there's more in the other clothes. Let's search. Go ahead. Oh! Hey, look, I found another 50. Yeah, so you did. Why... Oh! Ow! Hey, hey, hey, leave him alone. What's the matter with you? Hiya, fellas. My wife is just crazy about the way you fixed this coat. Uh, she wants you to make me a pair of pants to match. Oh, sure, sure. We'll have them ready for you tomorrow. MAN: Thanks. So long. So long. That guys' mother must have raised him on Shredded Wheat. [CHUCKLES] Come on, let's shred the pants. Okay. There we are. Now, watch your stroke. All right. To the beat. Here we go. One, two. Ah-ha. SHEMP: I'm glad he only wants one pair of pants. Say, I was thinking about Hargen, that bank bandit. You know, it's just possible that he's still hiding somewhere in this store. We gotta search every nook and cranny. I once had a granny who searched every nook and cranny. [LAUGHS] [LAUGHS] I did too. You know what she found? What? This! Porcupine, you search the front of the store thoroughly. Aye, aye, captain. Ooh! Why you... Oh! And mongoose, you and I are gonna search the back room. I'm not taking any more orders from you, you warthog. I don't blame you, kid. Oh! [YELLING] Look around. Now, I got you, you bank bandit. I got you. I'll crush your skull. I'll crush your skull. Oh, I'm sorry, Moe, I thought you were the bandit. Oh, forget it, kid. Oh, thanks. Pardon me, do your knuckles hurt? No. They will. Ow! Ow! [SCREAMING] What does that look like? A nail? Shh. [DOORKNOB RATTLING] That must be the bandit. Yeah. Hey, you grab him, I'll nail his feet to the ground, we'll send for the cops and collect the reward. Viva. Viva. [BOTH SPIT] [GRUNTING] SHEMP: I got you now. You won't get away. Hey, you stupid stooge! What's the idea? You trying to shoe me like a horse? Sorry, kid. We thought you were the bandit. Don't worry, I'll get it out. Go ahead. Ah! My toe! [YELLING] Hey, you're killing me. [NAIL SQUEALING] Oh! Ah! LARRY: Dry clean. Dry clean. SHEMP: Goldberg. Repair the pockets. Goldberg. Repair pockets. [MAN GRUNTS] SHEMP: Yes, what can we do for you, sir? We'd like to have our suits cleaned and pressed while we wait. SHEMP: Why, certainly. MOE: Yes, sir. That's what we'll do. Uh-oh. Ooh! [WHIMPERS] All right, bub. Where's that piece of paper was in my pants pocket? You mean the one with the numbers on it? That's it. That's it. And the letters L-R-L-R-L-R-L. Yes, yes. Where is it? I never saw it. Oh, a wise guy. Okay, fellas, make them talk. MOE: Oh, now, take it easy. Get them. Where's that guy who was here? He went thataway. Oh, I'll get him, I'll... Uh... Oh! Why... Cut it out, will you? Ouch! Oh! All right, come across with that paper. Oh, the paper? Yes, the paper. Why didn't you say so? There it is. [CRIES OUT] [AIR HISSING] Ow! Hey, Larry, I got him. THUG: Ouch! Ooh! Ouch. Nice work, Moe. [SIZZLES] We might as well press his pants. [SIZZLES] Ouch! [YELLING] Where is that paper? I tell you, I haven't got it. Ooh! You'll talk. Whoa! There, you'll talk now. Hey... Shut up. I... Where is that piece of paper? I haven't got it. Oh, still won't talk. Oh! Oh! Oh! Ooh! Oh, I didn't mean it, I didn't mean it. Honest, I didn't. Still won't talk. Oh! [CRYING] Oh! [GROANING] [LAUGHING] [GROANING] [SIZZLING] Oh, his head is steaming. [GASPS] Success. [CHUCKLES] Oh! Oh! Oh! SHEMP: Hey, Moe! Moe, Larry! Get me off here! Oh! Kid, take it easy. Oh, oh, oh. How do you feel, kid? Oh, I'm all right. We got him. We got Hargen. Oh. What's that? It's Hargen, all right. Nice work, boys. We're in the chips. The moolah. Now we can pay Skin and Flint. Oh, a couple of more. Hold him while I phone for the wagon. Okay, sure. Hey, as soon as we collect the reward, we'll be all set. [SOBBING] I'm so happy. I'm so happy. [SOBBING] Oh, green stuff. Nix. I'll take him. Thanks again, boys. MOE AND LARRY: Oh, thank you. Hurry up, count it quick. How much we got? All right, wait a minute. One hundred, 200, 300, 400, 500... A 50? Oh, how'd that get in here? [LAUGHS] [♪♪♪]
