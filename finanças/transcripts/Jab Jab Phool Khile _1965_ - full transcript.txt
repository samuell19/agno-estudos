It's good that you've completed your studies. It's another responsibility off our shoulders. [INDISTINCT] Okay, tell me. Do you like Kishore? Kishore? Aunt's son? Yes, dear. The son of my late friend and partner, Mr. Kishanchand. Nowadays, he manages the business in Darjeeling. - You like him? Like him? Oh, no, mummy. If you mean marriage, then no, please. Don't talk of marriage now. Right now, I have to decide.. - ..whether I want to marry or not. - What? Yes, mother. I haven't thought about my life yet. The lifestyle in America didn't give me time to think about it. It's made me so tired that I want to go to a place.. ..where it is peaceful for a few days. Where it is calm, quiet and peaceful. Where do you think I should go? Go to Kashmir. Oh, wonderful. I was thinking of Darjeeling, but Kashmir would be a better option. Isn't it, daddy? Why, dear? Have you got tired of your father in a day? Even you would be coming. Oh, no, darling, I'm very sorry. I can't leave Bombay for even a minute. - Ask your mother. - Impossible. For the next three weeks, I'm so busy with the Women's Association that.. ..I can't spare time to go for a massage. Look, how much weight I'm putting on. Your father doesn't like it at all. - Eat less, mummy. - Shut up. Daddy, then would I have to go alone? No, dear. I'll send Stella along with you. When would you like to go? Any day. Okay, my dear. I'll arrange for a houseboat today itself. - Okay? - Thank you, daddy. Welcome. Please. Bye. Ma'am, just a minute. God forgive. God forgive. - Where did he go? - [BIRD CHIRPING] - God forgive. Allah Baksh. Allah Baksh. - Coming, sir. Allah Baksh, the Lord has shown mercy on you. A passenger has come from Bombay to hire your houseboat. Alright. Come on, make haste. Madam, did you like this houseboat? Did you like this houseboat? Must be. Very much. But not that one. This one. But why? Shift my luggage to that houseboat. Madam, this houseboat belongs to a mad king. Ma'am, that houseboat belongs to crazy Raja. He won't give it on rent. He won't give on rental basis.. Do as I say. Do as I am telling you to. - Go. - Alright, madam. As you wish. As you wish. But I'll have to ask first. I'll have to ask first. [BIRD CHIRPING] Hey, Raja in hiding. Yes, I am the bush! You are very lucky, dear. A passenger from Bombay has liked your houseboat. It's not available. What? Go look for another one. A passenger from Bombay has liked your houseboat. - No. - No? Mad man. Madam, very, very bad luck. Ma'am, the houseboat is already booked. It is already booked. But no one has come to stay there yet, right? Nobody is there. Tell him I'll pay him more money. Alright. I will ask again. I've to ask again, madam. Lucky boy! Let's have a deal! She'll pay you more money! Dear, give your houseboat. Once I give my word, money is of no consequence. It's not available... it's already booked. Oh God! This man again.. mad. Brother, why don't you give it to them? Those people were supposed to come two days ago. They haven't come as yet. You shut up. - Mad madam. Mad. - What? Excuse me. He's a mad man. He's a mad man. Says that, he isn't hungry for money. He isn't hungry for money. What nonsense. Where is he? Take me to him. Alright. Come please. Raja. Raja. Manager, don't trouble me. Else I'll throw you into the lake. - Brother! - Munni, why are you trying to scare me? It's my houseboat. Giving it or not is my choice. - Excuse me. - Wha.. [BIRD CHIRPING] Who is this? Raja, she wants your houseboat. She's the one who wants your houseboat. What's the rent for his houseboat? Only 500. I'll pay you Rs.600. Rs.700? Rs.800? How much do you want? - Rs.500, ma'am. - What? Yes, ma'am. Only 500. Come, I'll show you the houseboat. Come, ma'am. Manager, you stay here. I'll be back. You're a strange man. If you wanted only Rs.500.. ..why did you refuse earlier? It wasn't about money. It was about principles. My houseboat had been hired by two men from Africa. - And now? And now? - And now, my sister told me that they were.. ..supposed to come two days ago. They didn't come.. ..so my houseboat was vacant. So I gave it to you. Come along, ma'am. Ma'am, this is my drawing room. Come, ma'am. And this is my library. There are books of.. ..Rabindranath Tagore.. ..Shakespeare and also Premchand. They are very good authors. And that's my music library. There are records of Mohammad Rafi, Lata Mangeshkar. And also western songs of.. What's the name of the fellow.. ..Elvis Presley, Everyone's there. Everyone sings. You're surprised by what I'm saying. Isn't it, ma'am? Your surprise isn't unnatural. I'm an illiterate person. But a lot of educated people come here.. ..and I learn from what they say. Oh! Ma'am, this is the dining room. Is it nice? Yes. And ma'am this is another room. I call it bedroom. This is the bed. The bed sheet is made of Kashmir silk.. ..and beneath it is, a Dunlop tire mattress. Dunlop tire? Yes, ma'am. Look at this. Okay. Dunlop pillow. Yes. - Beautiful! - Thank you, ma'am. Okay, ma'am. I'll bring your luggage in. The luggage is already here. Okay, ma'am. Call me if you want anything. I'll be right outside. Greetings, ma'am. Raja. Greetings, sir! Hello. Raja. - Sir, you've come. - Yes, we've come. Did you get our letter on time? Yes. But you didn't come on time. So I let out my houseboat. But why? Because you arrived two days late. But last year we were late by 12 days. Last year was different. This year there's a demand for houseboats. I understood. - Have you given the houseboat to a woman? - Yes, sir. - Is she beautiful? - Yes, sir. Is she young? Look, sir. My guest is more important to me than my life. But I can't tolerate any rubbish spoken about my guests. Sir, you hire another houseboat. Allah Baksh's houseboat's there, sir. It's very good, sir. Go there, sir. - We're going. - Go. Greetings, sir. Gentleman.. ..take off the 'to let' board and keep our luggage inside. - Okay, sir. - And listen.. ..is the guest more important than your life? Yes, sir. - Then see to it that no one talks bad about us. - Okay, sir. - Bring the luggage in soon. - Boss, there isn't one but two! - Two? Oh! - Jhunjhun. - Yes. - Do you see what I see? - Yes, boss. Let's retreat. Run. Call me soon, ma'am. Call me soon, ma'am. Hey brother, have you gone mad? What? Yes. Go and report to the police station. I'll complain to ma'am instead. Don't you dare say anything to ma'am. Understand? I'm going. - Going where? I'll throw you into the water. - Throw me then. - Shall I? What shall I throw you into the water for? You're my dear sister. Ma'am had asked you to write a letter everyday. Ma'am, you even have to write a letter to Kishore. Why? - Remember, you had promised to him at the airport. - Okay. Okay. Dear Kishore.. My dear Kishore.. Oh, no. - Stella.. - Yes, ma'am. Stella, how had you written your first letter to your boyfriend? Oh, ma'am. I haven't got a chance yet. But you can write 'darling', ma'am. No? Sweetheart? - Oh, no. - No. Let me think. Hey. Hey. - Stop it! - Why? My ma'am is getting disturbed. - What? What happens to her? - She's getting disturbed. She doesn't like it. She doesn't like it!? Tell your ma'am that I've given the houseboat on hire. Not myself. If I feel like it, I'll sing, I'll play. If I don't, I won't. - So you won't stop? - No. Then I'll tell her, you said you'll play if you don't want to.. ..you won't play if you want to. Then we'll leave your houseboat. We will go to the houseboat where no one plays music. Ma'am! Ma'am! Hey brother, are you afraid? Afraid? This Raja isn't afraid of anybody. I'll do what I want. I'll go wherever I want, play whenever I want. - You're mad. - These people.. "Don't fall for outsiders." "Don't fall for outsiders." "They are bound to leave one day." "Don't fall for outsiders." "Don't fall for outsiders." "Whenever this beautiful season comes.." "..when this beautiful season appears.." "..some story or another is always made." "..some story or another is always made."

"How will the stormy days be spent?" "Don't fall for outsiders." "Don't fall for outsiders." "They are bound to leave one day." "Don't fall for outsiders." "Don't fall for outsiders." Hey. Yes, ma'am. Even after Stella's warning, you didn't stop your singing. Why? But I've stopped it now, ma'am. Why, ma'am? Am I such a bad singer? I'm not bothered about your good or bad singing. I'm concerned with you stopping it. Why? Because I was writing a letter. And when I'm writing a letter, don't sing. Okay, ma'am. I understood. I won't make the same mistake again. When you finish singing, I will write my letter. I mean, when you finish writing, I will start singing. Is it okay, ma'am? Wonderful! Ma'am, please wake up. - You? - Greetings, ma'am. - What are you doing in my bedroom? Me? I had come to place flowers in the vase. I come every morning to replace the flowers. Look. Oh. Okay. But from now onwards.. ..place the flowers only after I wake up. And knock before coming in. Have you understood? I've understood, ma'am. When you finish writing letters, only then should I sing. When you wake up, only then should I replace the flowers. That too after knocking the door. Okay, ma'am? Okay, ma'am. I shall leave now. Ma'am, didn't you like my brother's singing? Yes, he sings well. Then why didn't you give him a bonus? - Bonus? - Yes, it's the custom here. If you like something about someone, you give them a bonus. [SIGHS] Okay, you tell Stella to bring tea for me. - I'll give your brother a bonus. - Okay, ma'am. [KNOCKS DOORS] - What now? - Ma'am. - Raja. - Yes, ma'am. - Please post this letter. - Okay, ma'am. And listen.. - What happened, ma'am? - This is your bonus. You sing well, that's why. Take. Please take. Greetings, ma'am. Where are you going? - Just going to say hello to the neighbors. - Shut up. I will say hello to the neighbors. - What will I do? - You go inside and read the newspaper. No, boss. I will go with you. - Do you know what will happen if you do so? - What will you do? I'll sack you your mom, your dad, your brother and you from the job. Okay. You sack me and my family. But remember.. ..if you do so, I'll reveal your secret to everyone. Jhunjhun, you're my secretary.. ..but I treat you as a friend. I'll take you there, but on one condition. Not one but thousands. According to your status, you flirt with the maid.. ..and I'll flirt with her madam. - Agreed. - Very good. - I'll take this flower. - But I've bought this.. You buy another.. But, boss, I don't have money! Munni! God knows where she went! - Munni. - Good morning. Good morning! - Whom do you want to meet? - I've come to meet you. And my secretary to meet your maid. I've no maid. I myself am a maid. - You're the maid? - Yes. - Then my secretary has come to meet you. And I've come to meet your madam. - Man. Hey, man. - Young lady. Look here, I'm a man too. I saw that. Why have you come? I've come to say hello to you. Hello. Hello. I'm your neighbor. And I believe in God's saying that.. ..that if you love me.. ..then love your neighbor too. But how did you come in here? I've come in to express my love to God.. ..I mean you. Oh shut up! I didn't hear anything you said right now. I mean to say you get out. Please listen to me. I said please leave. Okay. It's easy to throw me out of the house. - Let's see how you get me out of your heart. - Get out. - Oh.. - I'll hand you over to the police. There's no need to call the police. - I'll handle them. - Raja. You men from Africa.. - Hey brother, where're you going? - I'm going to Hari Parvat. Why? Won't you sing here today? No, Munni. I will never sing here again. - Why? Are you afraid of ma'am? - It's not about being afraid. If I sing here, then ma'am listens. If she listens, then she likes it. If she likes it, then she gives me a bonus. If she gives me a bonus, then my heart aches! Wonderful, brother! If someone gets a bonus of 50p here.. ..then he salutes throughout the day. And ma'am gave you Rs.10 and your heart aches? Yes, my heart aches, not yours. My heart aches. I'm leaving. Mad fellow! [HUMMING] "This moment, is a moment of love.."

What's there to feel ashamed about, ma'am? First, I sang well, you gave me a bonus.. ..now you sang well, so I gave you a bonus. - Get out! I said get out! - I'm leaving, ma'am! Dare you come up again! Get out! Oh. You? Yes, ma'am. From today, I'll come to replace the flowers. Not my brother. - Why? - He's afraid of you, ma'am. Your brother's such a huge guy and he feels afraid of me? Why? What do I know? Only he knows! - Okay. Send him. - Okay, ma'am. Greetings, ma'am. [BIRD CHIRPING] - Hey brother! - What? Ma'am is calling you. Calling me? Why? I don't know. Only she knows. [BIRD CHIRPING] - Was ma'am angry? - That I don't know. She was sleeping. - Should I go? - Go. - Should I go? - Go. - Should I go? - Go, you've become mad. Okay. I'm going. [BIRDS CHIRPING] - Greetings, ma'am. - Greetings. - Did you send for me, ma'am? - Yes. Why didn't you come to replace the flowers today? Just like that. Okay. Are you afraid of me? - No, ma'am. I'm afraid of none other than God. But Munni was saying you were afraid of me. You're also a form of God, ma'am. What? God is present in every one of us, ma'am. You talk a lot. Go and post this letter. - Ma'am, can I ask you something? - What? Whom do you write letters to everyday, ma'am? To my family. Friends. Why? Just like that. I was wondering who all would be there in your family, ma'am. In my family, there's my mother, father, my brother. Ma'am, can I ask you the real thing now? - Ma'am, tea. - Is the real thing remaining yet? Ma'am. You. I was wondering, what all do you write in a letter? Don't you know what people write in a letter? Ma'am, we're like fish. We were born here, and we die here. Moreover, whom would I write a letter to? And you know that I am not educated. Suppose after your wedding.. ..your wife has to go to some other place.. ..won't you write a letter to her? Ma'am, I would keep my wife with me. I won't send her away. - You're mad. - Yes, ma'am. - Even my father was mad. - What? Yes, ma'am. My father was an educated man.. ..he even worked in an office. He came here, fell in love with my mother.. ..left his job, and married her. I was born later. Then later, my little sister was born too. Ma'am, they used to love each other very much. One day, they went fishing. They went very far. There was a storm that day, and they drowned. Oh! But, ma'am.. ..they used to love each other a lot, ma'am. When their bodies were found, even then they were holding hands. I also have the same dream, ma'am.. ..when we both die, even our hands will be in each other's' hands. - Who we both? - My wife and I, ma'am. - Are you married? - No, ma'am. I am unmarried. Fine, go and post the letter. Okay ma'am, please forgive my mistake. - Ma'am. - What is it? I have decided, ma'am, I will study. Good. Start going to school then. No, I won't go to school. I will learn from you. - From me? - Yes. Small kids go to school. I will feel shy there. But there are night schools for grown-ups, too. All old people study there. They will feel shy seeing me. Oh, you know A B C, right? All the English speaking men have gone. I won't study English. - Then? - I will learn Urdu. - I don't know. - Fine then I will learn Hindi. Okay, sit. - You are great, ma'am. - Sit there. No, ma'am. You are my mentor. Mentor sits up, and the disciple sits below. - Take this, ma'am. - Okay. A. B. A. B. C. D. C. D. - A. B. - A. B. - C.

Go and tell Raja that I will teach him today.. - ..not in the room but on the terrace. - Fine, ma'am. [BIRD CHIRPING] If I tell you something, will you feel bad, ma'am? No. I see that you are taking too much interest in Raja. Now you have started to teach him too. He is a good chap. Innocent, naive, decent. Yes. Stella, if he can learn something if I show some interest.. - ..what is the harm? - Nothing. Even I like him. I'll inform him right now. Man. Woman, child. - Wrong. Ma'am, this book is wrong. - How come? See, man is fine. Woman is also fine. But child is wrong.. ma'am, look here. - This is right. - No, ma'am. It should be like this. Man, woman, marriage and then the child. Raja, you always talk indecently. Don't you even know how to talk to a girl? If I made a mistake, please forgive me, ma'am. But ma'am, never before have I spoken to any girl. - So.. - Oh, you are a bore. Don't get angry, ma'am. Okay, tell me clearly how to talk to a girl. I will then talk like that. Learn some manners. What are manners, ma'am? One should do things properly. The way to speak, carry yourself, to wear clothes. Anything else, ma'am? Forget it. Leave now. Come tomorrow for lessons. Okay, ma'am. Greetings, ma'am. One should walk like gentlemen. [HORN HONKS] [HORN HONKS] [CAR START SOUND] Raja.. Mr. Raja! Where to? But why are you not talking today? My sister asked me not to talk too much. Greetings. Strange fellow. Boss, he is gone. Good morning. Ma'am, what has happened to you? Not to me but to you. To me? Nothing has happened to me, ma'am. Ma'am, you said that one should do everything properly. So now I will do everything properly. I will talk, walk and dress properly. Like this. No, Raja. No. You need not do all this. You are good as you are. You are really very nice. [BACKGROUND MUSIC] - Is it so, ma'am? - Yes, Raja. Original! Natural! Just like a flower. You're wonderful, Raja. Wonderful. Enough ma'am, don't praise me more. I will just take off.. - ..these clothes. - Oh no, Raja. Not here. In you room. Oh, pardon me, ma'am. I will never wear these clothes again. Greetings, ma'am.

Can write a letter too. Can I write to you? - Yeah, sure. - Will you answer, ma'am? Yes. - Don't worry, your father will recover very soon. And then come to Kashmir in the next season. - Will you, ma'am? - How can I say it right now? No, ma'am. Do come definitely and stay in my houseboat. I won't rent out my houseboat to anyone. I will wait only for you. You will come, won't you, ma'am? - Yes, I will come. - Thanks, ma'am, thanks a lot. Just wait for a minute. Driver, sir, please don't go. I will be back in a minute. I'll just be back. Stella can go from Srinagar but you can't go from my heart. I'll also come to Bombay with you. If you follow Stella, I'll fired you. If you fired me. I'll reveal your secret. Come on, Jhunjhun. We are friends, right? Ma'am, this is a present from me to you. Oh Raja. Thank you. Thank you so much. Greetings, ma'am. - You know, dear, what saved me? - Because the accident wasn't fatal! No, because God wants to fulfill my last wish. In Kashmir, you must've decided about your life. - I mean.. - I understood, daddy. [SIGHS] But the thought of marriage didn't cross my mind in Kashmir. And neither.. - What did you remember? - Nothing, daddy. There was a crazy chap there, talking about marriage always. - Whose son? - Whosoever's. You liked him? Oh mummy. He was a poor chap. I remember, a letter has arrived for you from Kashmir. - Possible it's his. - Let me see. Respected Ma'am Miss Rita Khanna. - Whose letter is it, dear? - It must be his. I had forgotten to pay the rent in the hurry. Must have written about it. - Daddy, please send him 500 rupees. - Sure. - Shall I leave now? - We were talking something, dear? Daddy, doctor has advised you to rest more and talk less. - Okay, good night, dear. - Good night, daddy. Good night, mummy. Good night. Greetings, ma'am. It has just been four days since you have gone. But my sister Munni says it seems to be four years. Further the news is that everyday morning.. ..I pray for your father's long life. - Ma'am.. - Stella, Raja's sent a letter. Really? What does he say? - Asking about daddy's health. - Oh, God bless him. He is a nice chap. 'Raja, I forgot to pay you the money in a hurry.' 'You will receive it in a couple of days.' Oh darn! Ma'am thought I wrote to her for money. Then why did you write to her, brother? [BIRD CHIRPING] I will come during the next season and stay in your houseboat. Stella too will come with us. Tell your neighbors. Okay, ma'am. Sure. Right away. Hey, guests from Africa. - Crazy! - Guests from Africa. What's it? Stella ma'am too will come with my ma'am, during the next season. Will Stella come, too? Did you get a letter? Yes, I received my madam's letter. She will come during the next season! Next season. When letter can make him so happy, what if she herself comes? He will go nuts! I think you're right. - Fish. - Where? "Don't fall for outsiders." "Don't fall for outsiders." "They are bound to leave one day!" "Don't fall for outsiders."

Brother, will you eat today? - Better you don't eat. - Why? It'll be good if we get used to starving.. ..because within a few days the rice and the money will both get over. Brother, listen to me. Rent out the houseboat. No, I had told my ma'am that I will wait for her. Till when? Half the season is gone. The remainder will pass by too. If ma'am doesn't come, will we starve? Don't worry, Munni. I'll work as a laborer and feed you. But I won't rent out my houseboat. Last year he was manageably mad. This year he is out of control. [KNOCKS DOORS] Come in. Rita. Oh, daddy. Kishore has written from Darjeeling. He too has taken the time out to go with you. I can't understand why you want him to accompany me? You know, dear, it is your mother's and my wish to make.. ..the friendship of both families last forever by getting.. ..the two of you married. We don't want to force this decision upon you. We want you both to stay together and understand each other. And if you happen to like Kishore, our wish will be fulfilled. - But I don't think, daddy.. - Oh, dear, you don't worry. You haven't interacted closely with him yet. He is a very good boy. Okay, daddy. If that's what you wish. That's a good girl! [BIRD CHIRPING] Gentleman, what are you looking for? A houseboat named 'Gulistan' used to be here. It is still here. But it is known as 'Madam' these days. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Raja. Raja. What's it, sir?

I'll shift tomorrow. - Keep the bag here. - Fine, sir. Call me if you need anything. I'm on my boat. Sir, ma'am always used to tell me that I ask too many questions. But what to do? There would be such situations. - Shall I ask you something? - What? Are you her father? What rubbish? Do I look Rita's father to you? No. - Then you must be her kid brother. - I'm not her brother. - Must be her servant. - Mind your language. I am Rita's fiance. - What are you to ma'am? - Fiance. I am marrying Rita. Raja, I haven't brought my cook along. Send tea. Okay, sir. Greetings, sir! [CAR STOPPED SOUND] - Kishore, how did you like my choice? - Beautiful. - Ma'am, you need to write to daddy. - He is insolent. - Who? Daddy, ma'am? - No, Raja. He himself requested me to stay in his houseboat. Now when I am here.. Let him sing, today. I will tell him that he is a nuisance. - What if doesn't sing? - Then nothing.. Go. - Good night. - Good night. [BIRD CHIRPING] Munni. Munni. What is it, ma'am? How.. How are you? Nothing has happened to me. I'm absolutely okay. - Where is Raja? - He has gone to the hills, ma'am. - Why? - I don't know. Only he knows. - Will you show me the way to the hills? - Why not, ma'am? - Come. - Come on. On that hill, ma'am. "Don't fall for outsiders." "Don't fall for outsiders." "They are bound to leave one day." "Don't fall for outsiders." "Don't fall for outsiders." "They don't become yours with love." "They don't become yours with love." "They are stone-hearted. They don't cry." "They are stone-hearted. They don't cry." "Never shed tears for them!" "Don't fall for outsiders." "Don't fall for outsiders." "Neither are they clouds, nor the stars.." "Neither are they clouds, nor the stars.." "..they all are paper flowers." "..they all are paper flowers." "Never grow a garden with these flowers." "Don't fall for outsiders." "Don't fall for outsiders." "I have done this once!" "I have done this once!" "I loved an outsider!" "I loved an outsider!" "This lovelorn heart says, sorrowfully.." "Don't fall for outsiders." "Don't fall for outsiders." "They are bound to leave one day." "Don't fall for outsiders." "Don't fall for outsiders." Raja. - Ma'am? - What's the matter, Raja? Neither did you come to receive me at the airport.. ..nor to greet me at the houseboat. I didn't think it right, ma'am. You used to salute me day and night earlier. It was different earlier. But now, there.. What's there? - Nothing, ma'am. - No, tell me. Even if I say or ask something, you will lie. Why will I lie? You lied, ma'am. You said you have mother, father, younger brother, servants.. ..but never said you had a fiance too. Fiance? My fiance? Who? - Mr. Kishore. - Kishore? Why laugh about that, ma'am? He must have joked with you. - Do city folk joke this way? - It's his habit. But it is not my habit to listen to such jokes. - Ma'am, who is he? - He is my friend. And daddy has sent him with me so that I get to know him well. Why? So that if I like him, I can consent for the wedding. - Will you marry someone of your choice? - Of course. - Shall I ask something, ma'am? - Yes. What is your choice? This you will understand when you see my groom. I will understand, ma'am, sure. Will you go to the houseboat? Will you go by my boat? Come. Give me these flowers. I will place them up. Fine. Why didn't you bring narcissus flowers today? They are available very far. And I don't feel like leave madam. - What? - Madam is the name of the houseboat. - Okay, go now. - Alright, sir. - Listen. - Yes, sir. - Ensure that the boat is here at 9.30. - Ma'am and I have to go sightseeing. - Okay, sir. Nothing. We're going to meet Mr. Kishore. - Sure, go. - Okay. Go, sir. Go. [CAR HORN] "Oh, God! Oh, God!" "Oh God!" Raja, tea.. Oh. It's ready, thanks. One should go, most definitely. One who doesn't visit Amarnath.. ..having come to Kashmir is like.. ..not taking a dip in the Holy Ganges upon visiting Haridwar. One should definitely go there. - Who all are going, by the way? - Rita and I. You and Rita are going? - Stella, keep the tea. - Oh. Sit.. Please sit. [BIRD CHIRPING] Take Stella, too. It is a snowy area. Someone should be there to attend to Rita. - Won't you drink? - I just had some. Thank you. Wow! Such delicious saffron tea! What to say? We like everything about this boat. But really hate the owner a lot. - Why so? - Last year we had come.. ..to greet Rita and we had to return swimming. - Why so? - He is jealous of us. Isn't he jealous of you? - What happened? - Nothing, just burped. Continue. What I was saying is that.. - What happened? - Nothing. I have clicked boss' snap in this pose. Excellent photograph. I will bring the album. - I will bring the album. - No, boss. I will bring the album. Let it be. I will see it some other day. No.. We will show it to you, today itself. Boss, for what does do I take salary? I will go. Do you want to bring the same album that I want to bring? Just as you, boss. Just as badly. Excuse us. - Let us both go. - Don't mind. In the water.. Water. Boss.. Boss.. Why not take Stella to Amarnath as well? Yes, Stella and Raja too. Why is Raja needed? We are new, Kishore, but Raja knows the place very well. But Rita.. - Why, don't you want Raja to come along with us? That doesn't make any difference to me. Okay. Let's go. [FOOTSTEPS] - Greetings, ma'am. - Thank you, Raja. Come, ma'am. Careful. - Not there, ma'am. Sit this side. - Why? I will sit in front, come. Come, sit, sir. Sit. Wear this and show it to me. No, Munni. It is madam's. She will get angry. She has gone. She will come late. Please wear it and show me. Munni, good kids don't play pranks. I can't wear it. Just once, please. - Fine, sit. - Sit. Close your eyes. - Good Lord! I forgot to bring my purse. - So? Kishore, do you have some money on you? Not much. Oh! - Raja.. - Yes, ma'am. - Turn the boat towards the houseboat. - Alright. Okay. God, you gave me birth in a poor family. But get me married to a rich man.. ..who can give me a beautiful dress! So, Munni? Yes, it looks very pretty. How beauty! Ma'am? How dare you wear my dress! Sorry, ma'am. I committed a mistake. How could you make this mistake? How dare you wear my dress! She asked me. If she asks you to jump in the river, will you jump? - No, ma'am. I didn't know that you are a thief. I am not a thief. Munni asked me. I will get it dry cleaned. Will I wear something you've worn? Beware if you keep it among my clothes. Throw it away. I don't care. [HORSE CART SOUND] [BIRD CHIRPING] How far is it? I'm bored. You wanted to come here. Ma'am, when I was small and I got bored.. ..my grandpa used to tell me a lovely story. But my grandpa isn't here. So what? The story is still there, right? Which story? The tale of the rose and the nightingale. I will narrate it only when you ask. Okay.. Narrate it. "There was one rose and one nightingale." "There was one rose and one nightingale." "They both lived in a garden." "This is a true story, thus said my grandpa!" "There was one rose and one nightingale." "The nightingale used to sing like.." - "..like.. like.. - How would it sing?" "The nightingale used to sing the way you talk." "That rose used to blush like.." - "..like.. like.. - How would he blush?" "That rose used to blush like the way I get nervous." "The nightingale didn't know the reason for the rose's blushing." "She didn't know that her song would make the rose's heart beat faster." "The secrets of the hearts didn't come on the lips.." "..and remained buried in the heart." "There was one rose and one nightingale." "What happened then?" "But till when can the secrets of the heart remain hidden?" "They are such buds which prick like thorns someday." "One day the nightingale realized that.." "..the rose was crazy about her." "If you like the tale, let me know. I'll then tell you the rest." "Yeah sure, why have you gone quiet?" "Both of them were obliged to become of each other." "The tale of their love became well known to the entire garden." "Both of them used to take the vows of life and death together." "There was one rose and one nightingale." "What happened, next?" "Then one day a hunter came to the garden." "He caught and took the nightingale.." "..and the lovelorn rose withered." "And the lovelorn rose withered." "Poets describe the tale of their separation, thus.." "..they used to sing, 'Nights don't pass without the beloved!'" "'Nights don't pass without the beloved!'" "Tears used to flow from the eyes even in blooming spring." "There was one rose and one nightingale." "This voice used to come from the twinkling stars." "That Love cannot be stopped by any obstacles." "One day the sighs of rose and the nightingale rose and.." "..echoed through the cage.." "The cage broke open and the prisoner was set free." "The hunter kept sighing." "All the forces of the universe could not stop them." "To sing for her beloved rose, the nightingale returned to the garden." Raja, such a nice story. "Always remember this story, in life and in death." "Whenever you love someone love like the rose and the nightingale.." "Love like the rose and the nightingale." "Love like the rose and the nightingale." "Love like the rose and the nightingale." [THUNDERSTORM] Sir.. Stay here with ma'am. I will bring the horse, sir. Raja. [INDISTINCT] Stella. - Stella. - Madam. Madam. Kishore. Stella. Madam. Raja. - Madam. - Raja. Raja. Madam. Madam. Where are you, madam? Madam. Madam has fallen down. - Stella. - Yes. - Stella. - Yes. - Is there milk? Just check. - Fine. [Yawning] - Raja, how is Rita? - Better, will regain consciousness. Fine, take this medicine. For you and Rita. You will feel better. This is not the time for love, Mr. Kishore. A doctor is needed. - Get the doctor from the village, go. - Okay. - I will heat the milk with Stella. - Okay, heat it. Hey, go with Kishore. Wants to warm the milk. Stella, get the milk. - We don't have milk in stock. - We don't? - Do one thing. - What? Bring the milk out from neighborhood. No way. I won't go alone there. - You won't go alone? - No. Come here. - Don't be afraid. Hold my hand. - Okay. - Done. Now let's go. - Okay. Hail the invisible! Hail the pure! Hanuman, deal with the enemy! Hail 'Mahakali' (Goddess), what You say happens. 'Alakh. Alakh. Alakh.' Sir, can we heat our milk in your fire? Sure. - Stella, heat the milk. - So nice. Thank you. - Greetings! - Bless you! Ma'am, is someone sick? Yes, my ma'am fell down in the storm. Fell down in the storm? Doesn't matter. People fall from the path of virtue. When the truth comes out, they fall from the eyes. Stella, just see if the milk is hot enough. Why are you scared, dear? Do you have any secret too? No, I'm a simple and straightforward man. Yes, definitely. As straight as a mesh! But dear, aren't you deceiving.. ..this lovely lady and your subjects. What does 'subjects' mean? Subjects? I don't know the meaning of subjects. But I know! Subjects means 'under someone'! Under? This sage speaks in English. Only English? I know all languages of the world. Hindi, Urdu, Chinese, Japanese, Russian, English.. all the languages! Even his secretary knows all this, sage. Secretary? He is a gem of a man. Dear, leave this rascal.. ..and become friends with him. Oh no. What are you saying, sage? He is a big cheat. He fooled me in disguise. No, he didn't fool you in disguise. He just expressed his love. Possible he is sitting in front of you in disguise even now. Recognize him, dear, recognize him. Put your arms around his neck and say.. ..'Jhunjhunwala, I love you a lot!' 'I want to marry you!' Say it. What are you saying, sage? I am speaking the truth, Stella. I cannot live without you. I love you a lot. - Sages here are such dirty fellows. - I am not from here. - Stella, he is not a saint. - Then? - He is not a sage. - Then? He is a very good man. See who he is. - Jhunjhunwala. - You cheat. No, no. Stella, forgive me. I loved you. Fire him right away. Right away? If you fire me, I will let out your.. Shut up. I cannot fire you right now. No. You have to do that. Darling, you don't understand. If I fire him right here.. ..he will turn to a log in this chilling cold. - I will fire him upon reaching home. - No. You don't understand, darling. Pick up this milk and come along, Jhunjhunwala. - Come on, Stella. - You don't listen to me! - Pigeon in this cold climate? - Yes, it is an immortal pair. You mean immortal. It never dies? When Lord Shiva was narrating the tale of immortality.. ..to his spouse Parvati, long back this pair heard.. ..what they were speaking and thus they also turned immortal. Do you believe all this? Yes, ma'am. I have immense faith in God. Last year I came here. I prayed and I got whatever I wished. - What did you pray for? - Ma'am, this shouldn't be said to anyone. Now whatever you will ask, you will get. Pray for something. Please remove your shoes. Ma'am, if the Lord is going to grant you your wish.. ..He will drop two droplets of water on your mouth. If He is not going to grant the wish, He will not. So sir, ask for something. Wish for something. Nonsense. We have come here for sightseeing, not to ask for anything. Fine, ma'am. You ask. God has given me everything. What shall I ask for? Fine, then I will ask. 'Oh Lord, last year I asked you the wish that ma'am comes..' '..back again and You granted me my wish.' 'Now I ask You, may my ma'am never go from here!' - What happened, Raja? - Nothing ma'am. I ask for a wish from the Lord and the Lord gave me tears. Don't worry, Raja. I will ask God on behalf of you. Why you? - You saved my life, hence I will ask for you. As you wish! Oh Lord, please grant Raja whatever he wished for! Raja, whatever you wished will be granted to you. It will be granted to me, ma'am. Is it? Oh ma'am.. Oh ma'am.. I think, we should go, now. Let's go. Thanks a lot, Lord! Rita, I didn't like this insulting behavior of yours before everyone. Insulting? How did I insult you? Replying sarcastically, mingling this freely with raja.. If this isn't my insult then what else is? - Anything else? - And I also don't like your mingling.. ..with people not below your status. - Why don't you like it, Kishore? - Because you've come with me.. Correct yourself. I haven't come with you. You have come with me. And I will do what I like and not what you like. Kishore. Kishore. Thank God, still sleeping. Bore. Good morning, Rita. Good morning. - Where to? - Didn't we fix a program for Char Chinar? Yes, we had.. But.. But I won't be able to go. I have suddenly taken sick. Raja, take Kishore to Char Chinar. Even I am not feeling well. Oh really? Let me see.. Let me see. - Oh you have very high temperature. - Not much. - I will call the doctor, just now. - I am fine, Rita. - No Kishore. Come on. - Listen... - You're too much, Rita. - No, I won't listen. - Rita, I am absolutely all right. - I am asking you to lie down. You're not well. I'll call the doctor. There's no need for a doctor, Rita. - I know you need a doctor. - You are forcing me. Just keep quiet and lie down. Raja. - Take care. - Let's go, Raja. To the doctor, ma'am? No. To Char Chinar. Okay, ma'am. Ma'am, I didn't know you lie too. - Raja, you talk too much. - Yes, ma'am.. ..I talk too much. But I speak the truth. - What's up, Raja. - Fine, my friend. - How about a race? - It's on! - Let-set-go. - Go. Ouch! Let it be, ma'am. I alone am enough for them. No, Raja. I will also row. Bravo! We won, Raja! We won! We won! Oh God! - Ma'am, now I have come close. - To whom? To Char Chinar, ma'am. Oh! Come, ma'am. [LAUGHING] [SIGHS] - Very beautiful. - Who, ma'am? Your Kashmir. - Isn't it? - Yes, ma'am. But from where I see it, it looks even more beautiful. From where? Let me also see. No, ma'am. You can't see. Why? Because.. From where I see it.. ..in that Kashmir, even you are visible. And when you are visible, my Kashmir becomes more beautiful. Ma'am.. ..didn't you like what I said? You are crazy, Raja. Yes ma'am. Previously I was less. Now my craze has increased. Raja, I see that you are crossing your limits with each day. Well.. I didn't do anything against ma'am's wish, sir. - Shut up. - Kishore! Shut up, Rita. - I will never tolerate this in future. - Shut up! - Come with me. - Let go of me. Sir. You slapped me, I didn't say a word. But dare you touch my ma'am. I will break your hands. Don't try to act too smart. Get out. Raja! - Come, ma'am. Let's go. Let him die! - Kishore! That scoundrel had no brains. He pushed you? How dare he do that in front of me. Had it not been for you, I'd have killed him. - Doesn't he know that I love you? - Raja! - Yes ma'am, I love you. Very truly. - Raja, you.. I know, ma'am, you still don't love me. But one day you will love me more than I love myself. That day I will marry you. I will keep you on my boat. In my Kashmir. I won't let you meet any city man. Yes, ma'am, I will change your name even. I will change your.. ..name to Rajji. Yes, Rajji. I am telling the truth, ma'am. Don't get scared of me. We don't thrash those who are already dead. My ma'am asked me to bring you hence I came. Daddy, at Kishore's instigation.. Yes, I have come here upon hearing it from Kishore. Had he not wired me, you would've crossed all limits. What limits? What was I doing? Asking me what you were doing? What is he to you with whom you go out alone? And what is Kishore to me, with whom you have sent me? You may possibly get married to Kishore. And I may possibly get married to him. Shut up. Come with me. Munni. - Brother, where had you gone? What happened? Why is the houseboat empty? Where is my ma'am? Where is that Kishore? - They have gone. - Gone? - Where? - To Bombay. Ma'am's father had come. He slapped her and took her to Bombay. What? Slapped her? Took her to Bombay? This is Kishore's doing. Do they think I don't know the way to Bombay? Will you go to Bombay? For ma'am, I will go anywhere. He writes further, 'Ma'am, my kid sister told me that..' '..you father slapped you and took you away.' 'Write to me, I will come and break your father's hands'. Very good! How can the hero tolerate someone slapping his heroine? Shut up. Out you go. Get out. Nonsense. - So you want to marry this brute? - Yes, daddy. - Why? - Because he loves me. But the question is, do you also love him? Yes. But not Kishore, whom you want me to marry. Whether you wish it or not. I have already fixed it up. Against my wishes? Despite knowing that I have.. ..never taken a single step against my wishes. - This wedding won't take place. - Rita. Tell her that, I, Rai Bahadur Chunnilal.. ..cannot get my only daughter married.. ..to some illiterate, uncouth, two penny worth brute. And explain this to him too that the only daughter of.. ..Rai Bahadur Chunnilal, Rita, who is educated in the US.. ..is a progressive major who will not marry against her wishes. Don't go, brother. Don't go to the city. How not to go, Munni? My ma'am has written to me. But what will you do there? What will ma'am do? How will you face everyone alone? Ma'am is not alone, Munni. I am with her. And you don't worry. I will write to you everyday. Okay, brother. As you wish. May the Lord be with you! - Where are you going? - Is this Rita madam's house? Why? - I have come to meet her. - Get lost. Tell her that Raja has come from Kashmir. She doesn't meet tramps like you. Look, we don't raise our hands on the poor.. ..otherwise I would've just given you the answer to your abuse. Tell Rita ma'am that I have come to meet her. Didn't I say that ma'am is not at home? She isn't? Then tell her father that Raja has come. - Your name? - Raja.. Raja from Kashmir. - Wait, I will call him. Come on. You aren't playing against some ordinary guy, uncle. Let me see your move now. [KNOCKS DOORS] Yes. Sir, some Raja from Kashmir is here to meet you. - Let him come. - Fine, sir. - Uncle, he is the same guy. - I know, Kishore. Don't worry about him. Just watch my moves. But, uncle.. Let me think, Kishore.. ..how to position my pieces! [KNOCKS DOORS] Yes. Greetings, sir. So you are that Raja, who threatened to break my arms in the letter? Are you here with that intention? Sir, I wrote that in a fit of anger. What do you want now? Sir.. The thing is that my parents aren't alive. Otherwise I would've sent them for this work. Which work? Sir, you know that.. ..I love my ma'am a lot. I want to marry her. That's why I have come here. You want to marry her? But what if Rita doesn't want to marry you? How is that possible, sir? She wrote to me to come. What if I don't give you the permission to meet her? Oh! Sir, it'll be good if you give me the permission. You know that no one has been able to stop lovers from meeting. - Does this mean you are issuing threats? - Kishore! Keep quiet and wait for me in the adjoining room. Go. Raja, I have the power to stop both of you from meeting. But I am a gentleman and I won't use my might. But along with I will also not allow anyone.. ..to play with the prestige of my house. Sir, I haven't come to play with the prestige of your house. I am here to make her the prestige of my house. And to make the wealth of my house your wealth? We poor consider the lady of the house as our wealth. If you too consider it this way, then definitely.. ..I have come to make your wealth as mine. There is only type of wealth. And it is this! Take as much as you want. You want more? Take more. Pick it up. Pick up as much as you want. Do you want more? Take it.. Pick up all the wealth! Take some more. Do you want more? Raja. Ma'am, ask your father to.. ..remove this from between both of us. Daddy.. What's all this? Dear, I was just checking out that the one for whom you are.. ..rebelling against me.. what type of person is he! I like your choice. Really, daddy? We will talk later on. First take him to the guest room. Then come and meet me. Go. Hurry up now. - Go, dear Raja, go. - Come on. [FOOTSTEP] Strange ma'am, you were my guest there.. ..and here, I am your guest. And even I will consider my guest more valuable than my life. Really, ma'am? But ma'am that Kishore.. Oh, daddy will handle him. You had promised me Rita's hand in marriage. You were right, Kishore.. ..it is no ordinary person we are confronting. The whole game is very complicated, but interesting. But I have to see whether the move that I have thought of.. ..will be successful or not. I am talking about Rita and me, uncle. Kishore, go home. I will talk with you later. Come, dear. You liked Raja, right? Yes, dear. I have already appreciated your choice. But you will have to agree to one thing I say. Bring Raja to our standards. - Standard? - Yes, dear. It may happen that after the wedding you may feel embarrassed.. ..to introduce him to your friends and relatives. Teach him the ways of your society.. ..the manners, etiquettes. Teach him the way of carrying himself in high society. When he has learned everything, inform me. I will, then, introduce him to our society. Thank you, daddy. - Not at all, my dear. - Thank you very much. [BACKGROUND MUSIC] - Raja. - What? - BAT? - Bat. - CAT? - Cat. - RAT? - Rut. Not 'rut', Raja. Rat. No, ma'am. I am fed up. English.. Hindi.. it is all too much. Tell me ma'am, why do you want to change me? Didn't you tell me I am fine as I was, ma'am? Like the flowers, clouds, water.. Raja, everything looks good in its place. And now you are no more from just Kashmir but from here too. Look, our friends, relatives, society is yours as well. No, ma'am. I don't like it. I don't want it. Raja, won't you listen to such a small thing I say? Won't you listen, Raja? Oh, ma'am. Raja will have to listen to everything you say. Oh, you're a darling, Raja. Come on. Don't do that. - BAT? - Bat. - CAT? - Cat. RAT? Three. Four. One. Two. Three. Four. One. Two. Three. Pause. One. Two. Three. Pause. I am tired. Practice with Theresa, please. Come, Theresa. No, ma'am.. ..you asked me to wear western outfits, I wore them.. You asked me to speak a foreign language, I did that. You asked me to dance western, I danced too. But if you ask me to dance with another woman.. ..I won't dance. I will dance only with you. - Why? - You are my fiancee, not her. You are the limit, Raja. Come on. One. One. One. [SINGING SONG] [SIGHS] Hello. Not just hello, you should shake hands too. And not only touch the hands, but apply some pressure too. - Is it? - Come on again. Oh, you are a brute. Ma'am you said I need to apply some pressure too. Not so hard.. ..that it hurts the other person. I just applied some pressure, ma'am. Okay, now stop chanting this 'ma'am'. I have told you some many times to call me Rita. Only Rita. - I? - Then who? How can I take your name? Oh God, what will you marry me? You can't even take my name. That's how nervous you get. Really! Rita! See I can call you by your name. That's fine but say it with a little love. - Like this.. Rita. - Why with so much love? Because we address with love whom we love. The way I call you. Raja. [SIGHS] You love me, ma'am? "I kept saying 'no' but fell in love with you." "I kept saying 'no' but fell in love with you." "I wanted to refuse but ended up consenting." "I kept saying 'no' but fell in love with you." "I kept saying 'no' but fell in love with you." "See, you must have sighed a thousand times." - "Is it? - Only then did our eyes meet." "This excuse of yours is more beautiful than you.." "..as you taught me to fall in love." "Learnt to love from you, ended up loving you." "I kept saying 'no' but fell in love with you." "I wanted to refuse but ended up consenting." "I kept saying 'no' but fell in love with you." "I know the real story of yours. Had 'no' on your lips.. - Liar!" "Had 'no' on your lips.. but 'yes' in your heart." "No one would give her heart to a naive stranger." "You should be grateful to me that I have done this." "Just a slip and ended up falling for you only." "I kept saying 'no' but fell in love with you." "I wanted to refuse but ended up consenting." "I kept saying 'no' but fell in love with you." "Let go of these false tales. What's there in you.." "Liar." "What's there in you that I would go crazy for you?" "Even then you didn't stop coming in my dreams." "Didn't stop shooting arrows through your sly glances." "This complaint, I have made to you a thousand times." "I kept saying 'no' but fell in love with you." "I wanted to refuse but ended up consenting." "I kept saying 'no' but fell in love with you." "I kept saying 'no' but fell in love with you." - [BIRD CHIRPING] - [FOOTSTEP] What has happened to you now? I have read this letter, boss. Stella is ready to marry you. Why feel bad about that?

"..who is quite old fashioned." "What would I know of all this?" "Please impart a little justice to me." "For God's sake, please forgive my impertinence." "I am a stranger here." "I am a stranger here!" "That I can see others' arms in your arms.." "..from where will I bring such eyes, my dear." "It may be some custom and tradition." "But will I be able to accept such a tradition?" "How can my blood turn to water?" "How can I forget that I am an Indian?" "I am a stranger here!" "I am a stranger here!" "I have complaints and so do you." "These grievances are the fruits of our love." "When have the west and the east met that they will meet now?" "The flower which belongs to a particular place.." "..will only bloom in that soil." "It is not possible for me to live in this magnificent palace of yours." "I am missing that small houseboat of mine." "I am a stranger here!" "I am a stranger here!" "I am just myself. I am just myself." "I am a stranger here!" "I am a stranger here!" Rita! Raja. Raja, what have you done? You know, everyone approved of you. Everyone liked you. Even then.. What was the need to do all this, Raja? There was a need, Rita. Because this is not a question.. ..of only their happiness and likes, but also mine. And I did not like all this. - What did you not like? - I didn't like anything. What custom is it that lets the daughter drink in front of her parents? That the parents present their daughter not as their child.. ..but as an item of exhibition? One man's wife can dance in another's arms. Like you! You danced with others' arms. So what? You only wanted to accept this society. Our traditions. Our culture. Our culture? Our traditions? These borrowed traditions.. ..these stolen rituals, this sham, this nudity? You may call all this your tradition and culture but I cannot. Despite entering your society, I didn't forget my culture.. ..which is vast and deep like an ocean. That, which is thousands of years old. My culture is that culture which has given birth to.. ..women of substance like Sita. Queen Padmini, Habba Khatun. And not to Rita who can go into a stranger's arms.. ..leaving her husband-to-be. Your old and ancient way of thinking, your ancient cultures.. ..why don't you forget them all? Why don't you accept that.. ..there is a difference of thousands of years in Sita and Rita? This is what I cannot accept.. ..cannot accept that the land which has given birth to Sita.. I am sorry! Rita, I have no grudge against you. I still love you as much as I loved you before. But I cannot accept this new culture of yours. Never. Why did you agree to it before? I didn't know that under the pretext of teaching me a few good things.. ..you will try to snatch away.. ..my culture, my beliefs and my morals. That means you are still the same uncivilized person.. - ..under this outfit? - Yes. Clothes don't change the soul. And do you know the implications of what you are saying? - I know. - That means you don't want to marry me. I didn't say that. But if you want to marry me by insulting me.. ..then this marriage can never take place. Fine. Go back. Go back to Kashmir. Go back to your people. Go back to your society. Greetings, ma'am. You have no grudge against me. No complaints.. ..you still love me as much and still.. ..you left me and went just for a small obstinacy. Raja, if you are stubborn.. ..so am I. And whatever you have said, even if it is true.. ..I will not come to pacify you and win you over. Go. Go away! I won't come after you. Go away. Go away. Why did you go, Raja? Why did you go, Raja? Why did you go? I love you, Raja! I love you. I love you. [LAUGHING] [LAUGHING] To tell you the truth, uncle, I didn't believe that this trick would work. But I was hundred percent sure. Was I mad to keep that tramp in my house for so many days? I knew, Kishore, I could never.. ..force my daughter to marry as per my wishes. That's why I created this trap.. ..entrapped in which my daughter did exactly as I wanted. - What if it didn't happen this way? - How could it not, Kishore? Remember a small advice. You will always be successful in life. Snatch away wealth from the rich and self-respect from the poor.. ..and they will die forever. Raja too has died forever. He will never return now. There is no one between you and Rita, now. Better say there is no one between Rita and Raja, now. - Rita, dear. - I know it all. I have heard everything. I didn't know that to have his way.. ..a father can trick and deceive his own daughter. Think of it as you wish to! But I have done it for your good. I understand what is good for me and am going to bring Raja back. Rita! He has insulted our family and our dignified guests! He cannot come back here! There is no place for him! Very well. But I'm sure he has enough place for me in his home. - I'm going to him. - Rita. - Excuse me. Please get me a platform ticket. - It's alright. 42 Up mail will start from platform No.3 at 09:10 hrs. Thank you very much. Train going to Pathankot.. ..will leave platform No.5 at 09:40 hrs. Raja! Raja! Raja! Raja! Raja! Raja.. Raja.. Forgive me! Forgive me for whatever I said to you. Raja, it was my mistake. I got misled. I didn't know it was just a dirty game being played with both of us.. ..and with our lives. But I have realized that you were right. You were right in saying that a fish can live only in water. I accept my defeat, Raja. I have lost, Raja. I have lost, Raja. Please take me with you. I want to come with you. Raja, you had said.. '..ma'am, one day you will love me more than me'. 'That day I will marry you and will not let you meet city men'. Raja, you listened to whatever your ma'am said? You saluted all my commands. Won't you listen to one request of your Rajji? See Raja, your Rajji is begging you. Rajji begs you to take her with you, Raja. Take your Rajji with you, Raja! Raja! "Keep this tale with you, always.." "..in life and in death." "Whenever you love someone.." "..love like the rose and the nightingale."
