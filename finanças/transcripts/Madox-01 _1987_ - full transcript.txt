What a sorry sight. You have just witnessed the obliteration of an elite U.S. Army tank force... ...only three minutes after being engaged... ...by the Slave Trooper 01. Also known as the MADOX-01, it's localized combat capability is overwhelming. The device is also more resistant to NBC weaponry than a main battle tank. (NBC: Nuclear Biological Chemical) Furthermore, it can be deployed from a UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter. It's utility for anti-terrorist and anti- guerrilla operations is self-evident. Now, allow me to introduce the driver of the MADOX, who just performed this... ...dangerous exercise with these remote simulator tanks... Miss Kusumoto. Miss Kusumoto is also in charge of soft- ware development for this "Tankbuster." In order to demonstrate the versatility of the MADOX... ...she personally volunteered to be the driver today, despite being a woman. Unit #1 goes to Ichigaya tonight. We're in a hurry, so deliver it as-is. Unit #2 needs to be overhauled. Get started quickly. And then... Miss Kusumoto... ...you humiliated me brilliantly today. Lt. Kilgore, you fought admirably in today's action... ...but you just can't beat the MADOX in street warfare. I didn't come to talk about that. I have only one thing to tell you. I'll get even for today. I swear it. Not with you... with that wind-up toy. Remember this... next time, it won't be a remote-control game. Hey! This is terrible! What?! Over there! Holy crap! Hey, that's an E-2C Hawkeye! It's flying pretty low... Kouji... Sorry to bother you, but... Have you got something interesting? Daydreaming again, aren't you? Must be nice to work part-time. Never mind that! What is it? What's this? I have no idea. All of the sudden, it was here in the truck. It wasn't here when I loaded up. Say, what do you think it is? Kouji... aren't you an engineering major? Okawasaki Heavy lndustry... U.S. Army... Onose, I'll take charge of this! Huh? But... Well, then, what is it? It has "MADOX" written on it, right? It's just a piece of junk someone threw away. -I'm telling you, don't worry about it. -Uh, but... I treat you to ramen all the time, don't I? Cheater! Sign: "Onose Motors" This is absolutely unthinkable! How could an SDF transport... (SDF: Self-Defense Force; Japan's military) ...lose top-secret cargo in a simple traffic accident? Er... The report said that it was an unavoidable... You're being naive. It was terrorism, of course. You people don't know the Eastern Bloc's methods. Hey, if the Eastern Bloc does get hold of it... ...we'll expect you to repay us for the huge development expenses we've incurred... ...as per our contract... Mr. Okawasaki! You, too, should watch what you say! Another viewpoint is that this accident was one of your publicity stunts! Wh...What are you saying? We're the victims here! In any case, this couldn't have come at a worse time. We were just about to go into field-testing. This is terrible. Really, they're missing the point! It's been fourteen hours since the accident... ...and yet, the top brass are still in a panic. The actual loss aside, I'm to blame for leaving it in scramble mode while it was being moved. I'll bring it down if it starts operating. The Army's already trying to recover it. It's best that you leave it to us. Besides, MADOX-02 is being overhauled right now. Any new developments? No. There's still nothing from the SDF search troops. We're having trouble tracking down vehicles that were at the scene. And we can't very well ask the Police for assistance, now, can we? We're preparing for the worst, and forming a recovery unit. -Did you say "a recovery unit?" -That's me. -Lt. Kilgore? -Surprised? But after all, I'm the only one who's fought against the MADOX... That's too dangerous. There's nothing to worry about. Our objective is recovery. I won't break it. You still don't get it, do you? It's you I'm worrying about! Awfully sure of yourself, aren't you... Well, fine. I've got a trump card too. Lt. Kilgore is a dangerous man, but he's the best tank driver in the Army. He was born into the wrong era, I fear. Say, will this be all right? It won't drop through the floor, will it? Well, this apartment was built a long time ago... Don't scare me like that! It looks alright now... Hey, what's this photo, Kouji? Didn't you say you broke up with Shiori? Hey, you, cut that out! Give that back! Man... Shiori is too pretty for words. When she goes off to study in England... ...every guy in Japan is going to be miserable! How do you know about that? Eh? Oh, didn't I tell you? She called this morning and asked me to give you a message. Why didn't you tell me sooner? Now you're crying over spilled milk! Didn't you break up with her? Just tell me what she said! She said, "I'll be waiting on the observation floor..." "...of the NSR Building in West Shinjuku, at 8.:00 tonight." Say, Kouji, you've been saying that you were breaking up... ...but isn't it ultimately up to you? Shiori thinks... Uh, never mind... Sorry... Well, I still have work to do... ...but tell me if you find anything interesting in there, okay? Well, see ya! Now, then... A manual... "The Slave Trooper MADOX-01." What is this? I see... This is awesome! To get inside... ...press the Open Switch. This is so cool! I'm getting excited just looking at it. I'm amazed that something like this even exists. Ah... The joints get locked when the power unit is turned off. I wonder if it has an eject function of some kind... Maybe I can even make it move! I don't get this... Oh... okay! It can adjust to your body size. Let's see... About this much? Feels just like wearing ski boots! What now? How do l get out of this thing? Wh...Wh...What the...?! Stop! Hold it, stupid! I...I'm not ready yet! Stop! What's happening? -We've got the MADOX's activation signal. -Where? Tokyo! Nakano district! So, it's moved. It's heading toward Shinjuku! This is a disaster. It won't stop! W...Where's the brake?! Here! L...Looks like I've stopped. Uh... Excuse me...? Huh? Ah, yes! I'll take this, please! Can you warm it up in the microwave? Damn it! Come on, shrimp! That's it... a little... more! Honestly, this is like feeding myself with someone else's hands! Still, this is really embarrassing! This thing just sucks me in, and l can't figure out how to get out! The NSR Building at 8:00, wasn't it? Shiori... Foreign-exchange study? In England. For three years. What are we gonna do for three years? That's why I want to talk to you about it. Talk? What's there to talk about? My father is making me go. So that's how it is, huh? It's not hard to figure it out. I'm just a poor student who has to work for a living, after all... So, when are you leaving? This Sunday. That's only four days from now... In other words, we're finished! Shiori, what do you want? Heck, seeing as how I'm all dressed up... ...I might as well go and find out. What's with the Marines? They're going up the Tama River? They'll miss the show! Self-Defense Forces? The Self-Defense Forces, let me see... have them direct traffic! Lt. Kilgore! What the hell do you think you're doing? Well, well. If it isn't Miss Kusumoto. Do you intend to start a war? Taking off in a prototype airborne tank... Please don't turn Tokyo into another Vietnam! Tokyo or Vietnam, it's all the same battlefield to me. It's the perfect jungle in which to blow away your pretty MADOX. It'll be a catastrophe. Hey, don't worry. I'll knock it out and keep this affair from escalating. Let's go! Scramble and take off! Lt. Kilgore has taken off on the MADOX recovery mission... ...with a high-mobility airborne tank and anti-tank helicopters! What did you say? That's going too far! As it stands, the heart of the city will be in a huge panic. It may be that nobody will be able to stop Kilgore and the MADOX. Is there anything we can do? The MADOX's goal is as yet unknown. We simply can't read the driver's actions. But... if I can reach him before Lt. Kilgore does, I think we'll have a chance. But, the MADOX is... I'll take Unit #0, from the motive-power test bed. Is there any chance of success? I don't know... but we have no choice! Come on, you heard me! I want diesel! Fill 'er up! Fill 'er up! All right! I'm coming, Shiori. Wait for me! Yeah! What a ride! Hey, what're you doing? I don't put up with weirdos hogging the road! Get out of the way, you jerk! Watch this! You're really hot, man! It was easy! Huh...? Stop it! Stop! I still got 30 more loan payments to make! Oh, my top! All right! It's a Cabriolet now! So long, suckers! Oh yeah, cars are not allowed in some areas of Shinjuku on Saturdays. What's with these guys...? Uh oh! Yes, we're certain. Shinjuku 5-Chome intersection. Request back-up. I can't get away in this crowd! They've come to take this thing back! This is getting serious! This "MADOX" must really be important. Huh? What is that? It's weird. Is this a TV show? I hope it's not a Yakuza war! But what am I supposed to do when I can't even get out of it? Get out of my way, blockheads! I just want to go to the NSR Building! You got that? Jackal 3 to Spider 1. We've located the MADOX. Spider 1 to Jackal 3. Attack! Fire at will! It's still moving! The right arm's moving on it's own... Stop! It wasn't me! It did that on it's own! I'm telling you, it wasn't me! One of the Apaches was shot down. The unit has authorization to destroy the MADOX! That's just what Kilgore wants. What about the MADOX? It's heading to the skyscrapers, Apaches in pursuit. Evacuate the civilians, quickly! I'm going in! They're ganging up on me! Oh! Over there! Look out below! Shiori... it looks like I've gotten mixed up in something terrible. Now then... Which way to the NSR Building? Now this is convenient! By going straight here, I should come out at the West Entrance. When I do, it'll be right in front of me! Another lunatic's popped up! Back off! Sign: No Smoking in the Subway! I've found the West Entrance. That's the building! Oh crap! Okay! Move it, MADOX! You should be able to hear this. Answer me! I can hear you. And you're giving me a headache! What the hell are you trying to accomplish... ...by causing all this uproar? You're the ones who are causing an uproar! I'm just... "Just..." what? None of your business. Anyway, give up. You can't escape now. That's something I won't know if I don't try! Great! Damn it! That does it! I'm taking you with me! The NSR Building? You're sure that's what he said? All right, Captain! We've got our drop site. Put me down in front of the NSR Building! Make it smooth. I'll buy everyone a drink after this. It's the perfect ring for a return match. Sign: "NSR Building Parking Area -- Exit Elevator" All right! Shiori's up there! D-Damn! Persistent, aren't you? I won't let you go any further! Damn it! I don't want anything to do with you anymore! I thought you were an amateur... ...but it looks like I won't have to hold back now! Get back! Out of ammo...?! I've had enough of this. It's time we stopped playing around. Why, you! Why won't you give up already? I can't move! I...I'm dead for sure! It can't be! He's just a boy! Who are you? What were you hoping to accomplish? I'm Sugimoto Kouji, a sophomore at Kanto lnstitute of Technology. I just want to meet a girl who's waiting for me atop the NSR Building. What's that got to do with anything? Listen to me. This thing is what's causing all the commotion! It swallowed me up, and then it shot up a helicopter, all on it's own! I understand. Your carelessness is not inconsequential... ...but I'm also largely to blame, for letting it be transported in scramble mode. Miss Kusumoto, this is Spider 1, Kilgore here. Too bad. You won't get your chance. Yeah, thanks for the show. As always, you fought well. Come up here, on the double. I'll make the pickup. Thank you, but I won't be turning him over to you. I'll settle this personally with Yokota Base Headquarters. Okay, fine. Do what you like. Hey, where are the civilians in this building? They're only on the top floor, sir. Say, do you suppose you could take me up to the 50th floor for a bit? Is it that important? Now that you mention it, why am I getting so frantic? "...isn't it ultimately up to you?" First floor. Wha...What the...? It's a trap! Fire! As you ordered, sir, we've taken care of the bigger one! But... are you sure that was the right thing to do? It's fine. Are you all right? What the hell is going on? That was naive of me. He's going to see this through to the end. His target is the MADOX. He'll come after you until he destroys it. If you want to stay alive, you'll have to beat Kilgore... With the MADOX. Th...That's impossible! There's no way I can beat him. I barely know how to walk and move the hands! You haven't got a choice! Either the MADOX gets destroyed, or you crush Kilgore! There's no other way. What about you? They wrecked my legs. I can't move at all. Who is this Kilgore guy? You'll see. You think I can take him? With the MADOX, you should be able to. You were excellent in our fight. Have you read the entire manual? No, there wasn't enough time. I see... Well, then, I'll give you a few pointers. Welcome, MADOX. The opening act is over. That's him! Let the main event begin! You bastard! Come on, try and kill me! You're pathetic! What's wrong? Done for already? Can't you let me enjoy this a little bit longer?! D...Damn! Take this! Serves you right! Flipped over like a turtle! Hurry it up! -"Weight overload. If you are by..." -Oh no! "...the door, please exit the elevator..." N...Not this again! That's great. If you can't even do that much... ...you'll ruin the name, "Tankbuster!" That trick won't work on me! No good! What do we do, MADOX? This is death by slow torture! What floor am I on? I should be pretty high up. I hope I've got a lead on that guy with the tank. Shiori! Shiori! You've been waiting for me! Kouji! Gotcha! Run, run! You've got nowhere to go, MADOX! C...Crap! It's the final round! Come on, MADOX, show me what you've got! Where are you, Kilgore?! Found you! You've got guts! Take this! The smells, the sounds, the vibrations! I love it! I'm not running away anymore! Die, damn you! This is the end! He got me! You're strung up in a clever trap! W...Why you! I don't mind falling if you come with me, MADOX! "MADOX...?" Both you and MADOX are out of your minds! Eat this! Kouji! Are you all right? Are you hurt? Yeah. I'm really beaten up. Sorry to have kept you waiting so long. But, I've got something I want to tell you after all, Shiori.
