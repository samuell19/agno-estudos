[gentle music] [engine whirs] [Percy screams] - Blackjack! That raises my winning percentage to 82.463%. - That's wonderful, Percy. - I've almost worked all the bugs out. Just think I'm on the verge of discovering something as important as Newton's First Law. What should I call it? Should I call it first law of chance? Or how about the Doolittle Principle? - How about calling it Doolittle's last chance? - Huh? - I said, you haven't called me in a week. - Oh, I, I meant to call, but I've been real busy with my Wang. I had a hard disc and it works a lot better than a floppy. - You mean you'd rather stay home and play with your wand than go out with me? - No, that's not true. The fact is I wanted to ask you to come over to my apartment, but I didn't know if you wanted to. - Oh, well that would be fun, Percy. You've never invited me to your apartment before. [dramatic music] - Doolittle I caught you again, gambling again, huh? - Oh, I'm not gambling. Not technically. Gambling is defined as wagering speculating or betting on the outcome of a game or contest or event. I'm merely doing research, sir. - You're gambling your life away! Wasting it! Wasting the finest mathematical mind I have ever seen. - But professor I'm on the threshold of discovering an entirely new field of mathematics, the mathematics of infinity, where the laws of chance prevail. I'm merely gambling to prove... Researching to prove my theories. - [Professor] For someone with IQ past 200, you are an idiot! I read your last paper and I don't care what your fancy formulas are saying! There's no way you can predict which card you're gonna be dealt. - I know my theory has a few holes, but given a little more time, I think that I could- - [Professor] Time has run out for you, Doolittle. You've been working on your thesis for five years and what you have, huh? 10,000 computer simulations and some gobble de gook formula. You are finished to Doolittle. I am going to cancel your fellowship at the end of the term. - That means you're gonna have to drop outta school. And who knows when we're gonna see each other again. You act like it doesn't mean anything to you. Like this is temporary nuisance that stands in the way of you and your research! Aren't you even a little worried? - Don't you see Amanda, if I can prove my theories, I'll be famous and then I can continue the work my great-grandfather started. - You don't mean... - Yes. The theory of anti-gravity. - [Amanda Voice Over] It was then that I knew Percy had been too sheltered in his world. I myself was a child of intellectual parents, but I had brothers and sisters. Poor Percy. His parents, they were Doolittle's, the famous Doolittle mathematician family. They were super geniuses. He grew up the only child, alone with his computer since the age of three. He was a math wizard and he was so pure and so gentle. I loved Percy from the moment I first saw him in computer lab, but something just had to be done about Percy's lack of worldliness. I mean, we had five dates already! We went three times to the library and once he helped me with my biology project. And once he took me to the planetarium, but he never even held my hand. And then he invited me over to his apartment to see his Wang and what happened? Nothing. We played blackjack on his Wang all night! And then I came up with this wonderful idea that would solve all his problems. All he had to do was go to Las Vegas. He could apply his theory to the real world and with the money he could win, he wouldn't need his fellowship. So I talked him into going for the weekend. I even loaned in my car and we all took up a collection in computer lab. We raised $400 as a bank roll for Percy in Las Vegas. We had faith in Percy. Whether you could understand his theory or not, everyone agreed, he was unbeatable at blackjack. [engine revs] I sure hoped Percy would be all right in Las Vegas.

You in? - Yeah, I'm in. - [Dealer] Good evening, Ms. Redcliff. - Here's one for me and one for Poopsy. - [Dealer] How are you tonight? - Oh, I just fine. My poor Poopsy had troubles sleeping last night. Poopsy is the name of my late husband. So when Poopsy died, I bought a beautiful little silver Persian kitten and I named her Poopsy but then Poopsy died too. So I talked to my lawyer and he suggested Poopsy here. We been together five years already. - That's very nice. I have a pet myself. It's my Wang. - Ugh. And that's disgusting. You should be ashamed. Come on, Poopsy. We'll go find another table. - What did I say? Did I say something wrong? - She's a little old for you. You standing? - Yes. I'll stand. - [Dealer] No, no, no. - Oh, oh. I just, gosh, I keep getting everything all mixed up. [upbeat music] [gentle music] 21, I win. - It's 11 in a row. You're starting to make me look bad. - I'd say my chances for a winning 20 in a row- - 20? Hey look, pal. They don't like cheaters around here. - Cheating? Me? I would never do that, on my honor. [upbeat music] Blackjack. - What's going on with him? - Beats me, Ace. - Everything beats you, Louie. A pair of threes beat you. Come on. - Hit me. Hit me. Hit me. - This guys no good. - Yeah, even I'm not that stupid. - That's a hard 19, counting the ace as one. - Hit me. Give me the two of hearts. [crowd applauds] - I'll tell you what, this guys a mutant. - What's he doing? - He makes dumb moves but he wins every time. Like he knows what card is coming up. - He's not betting big. Switch decks. Switch decks. - He's out there floating in the hemisphere. - Why is he changing decks? - Oh, you'll win with this deck too. - You think so? Thank you sir. 18. I'll stand. - [Dealer] 19. - I wanna stop now. Gee. That was fun. A lot more fun than playing with my computer. [gentle music] [jaunty music] - There he is. Come on. - [Waitress] Okay, one cup of hot chocolate. - I always drink warm milk before I get bed. You see milk is one of the highest natural sources of calcium and calcium- - Anything else? - No thanks. Calcium reacts with your nerve endings to soothe them and relax them, thus relieving the tensions built up during... During the day. - Hey! Look who it is, the big winner. Say, mind if me and my pal sit down next to you? Maybe some of that luck will rub off on us. Ain't that right, Louie? - Yeah, we could use some luck. - Oh, it wasn't luck gentlemen. There's no such thing as luck. - Yeah. Right. But this is my pal, Lou O'Sullivan. Just call him Lou. Maybe you heard of him. Louie was a contender. Tell him, Louie. - I could've been a contender. - How many times I tell you, you was a contender. Not could've, was, was! - Yes, yes. - You got in the ring. Didn't you? You was trying, wasn't you? Then you was a contender, was! - Okay, okay. - Tell him Louie. - I was a contender. - Lou is a tough cookies. Got nerves of steel. Anybody messing with me, Louie takes good care of it. I say, how much did you win, anyway? - $4,022. - Oh, that's pretty good though. How much did you start with? - About $20. - Hey, we was just gonna go to little party. Maybe you'd like to come along. Maybe have a little champagne. - Oh, I don't drink. - Some good food? - I've already eaten. - Some beautiful ladies? - Well, I... Well, I better not. - Hey, why don't you come along with this? No sense sitting around your room, playing with your wang all night. - How did you know I had a Wang? - Listen, I'll go call the girls. See if they're ready. What do you say? You, you with us? - I'm with you, Ace. - Not you, dummy. What a comedian, he cracks me up. So what do you say? Do you wanna have a little party? A little fun? Stub a little pussy? - A Poopsy? - Pussy, not Poopsy. [upbeat music] - [Ace] Hey, this was really killing a house tonight kid. - [Louie] Yeah, you really burned then. - How'd you win 20 hands in a row like that? I bet you got some kind of system. - Yeah. He's he's gotta have a system. - Well, not exactly. You see, my theory involving random- - Me and Ace tried lots of systems. Ain't that right, Ace? We must have tried 30, 35 systems since we hit town. - Shut up and let Percy talk for Christ's sake. - You see, my work involves a new of mathematics, a mathematics of infinity. A place where time and space stand still. And they don't stand still so much as they merge into one place in time, in space, just these photons of energy and the way these photons of energy move is what makes things happen as they do. So I calculate what happens out there in that random space, infinity, and it's funny, but it's very much like predicting gambling and what cards are coming up next because it is after all the same phenomenon, random events. If my theory works for blackjack, I'll be able to apply it to the infinite zone. And theoretically, I can then complete the work my great-grandfather started on anti-gravity. - I failed to apprehend the connection between gambling and your theory. - Well, in the infinite sense, the house has the advantage, but in the short term, numbers have a natural rhythm. A flow. Apparitions are created, streaks of impossibilities occur. - You mean, you could predict the hot streak? - Why yes, that's what I've been trying to convey. - You gotta be kidding... - Almost assuredly, I am not. You see, I have a photographic memory and with all the computer simulation I ran, 10,420 to be exact, I can recognize certain patterns as soon as they start to happen. Sometimes I even know what card is coming up next. And that's what I'm working on now. [girls singing indistinctly] [upbeat music] Full house! Sixes over nine. - Oh... This game is fixed! He always wins. Well, I guess I'm gonna have to take off my pants. - Oh, yes. Oh! - Oh you hush! Woo hoo! Here we go! Aw! - Having fun, Percy? - I really like this game. - You stick with me kid, I'll show you a good time. Right, Louie? - A real good time. - Right, girls? - Oh, absolutely. - Give a break for Christ's sake, will you? Yeah, peace offering every week. I mean, how many catch up if you want... I'm telling you, it's a sure thing. It's like money in the bank. No, it's not a pizzeria. Hell no, I'm out at freight rackets, you know that. The horses? I gave up gambling. Geez, it's only five grand for Christ sake. Yeah, yeah! Yeah! Hey, Hey 48 hours, max. Boy, that's funny. What an imagination! Look, you got no worries. I like my head on top of my neck. [upbeat music] - Percy, would you mind taking care of the girls for a few minutes while Lou and I go and get some more champagne? - Sure, Ace. You can count on me. - Come on, Ace. Can't you go by yourself? I'm having fun here. - Listen, numb nuts, I don't care if you have fun, we want Percy to have fun, right girls? Oh, be nice to Percy girls, but not too nice. Not yet, anyway. You catch my drift? - Oh, ci. We will be mucho nice to Percy, but not too nice. Not yet. The night, she is young, and we are restless. Besides, there are so many things we can do first. [girls laugh] - [Louie] Oh, Ace... - Jack high, straight. - I'm getting bored. You never lose! - Well maybe I can lose next time. - You promise? - I promise! - Do you promise? - I promise! I promise! I double promise! I triple promise! I triple promise! I can't get a full house! [girls scream] [phone rings] - Hello? A little? No. I do everything. - Hello? - Percy? It's me, Amanda. - Amanda! Amanda! Stop, stop, it's my girl. I mean- - Percy?

But you were supposed to call me and you didn't. I started feeling bad cause I told you to go. - Amanda, no. - I could just see you sitting there all alone in that cold, lonely hotel room.
