GOD, I MISS NEW HAVEN. LISTEN... ...THIS CLASS IS YOUR DOORWAY TO EVERY OTHER COMPUTER SCIENCE COURSE IN THIS ENTIRE COLLEGE. IT IS A REQUIREMENT THAT I MAKE IT TOUGH. WHY IS THAT A REQUIREMENT? TO WEED OUT THE UNWORTHY. THE CODING FIELD IS OVERCROWDED WITH DABBLERS, AND I FOR ONE... EXCUSE ME, TAKE THOSE OFF! THANK YOU. AND STOP LOOKING AT YOUR NAILS, THANK YOU. SO, IF YOU WANT TO TAKE ANY OTHER COMPUTER SCIENCE COURSES AT THIS COLLEGE, OR YOU WANT A CAREER IN IT, YOU HAVE TO TAKE MY CLASS, AND IN ORDER TO PASS MY CLASS, YOU HAVE TO WORK... VERY HARD.

YEAH, BUT WHAT FEATURES DO YOU THINK WE NEED? YOU KNOW, IT WOULD HAVE A GIRL AIRLIFTED OUT OF MY BED - THE SECOND I'M FINISHED WITH HER. - OOH! YIKES, I DON'T THINK TELEPORTATION EXISTS YET, LANCE, SO... I WAS BEING THEORETICAL. YEAH, THEORETICAL. YOU KNOW, IT WOULD HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT A GIRL COULDN'T FIND ME AFTER, YOU KNOW? OR EVEN IF SHE WANTED TO FIND ME SHE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO BECAUSE THE INFORMATION WOULD GET LOST OR MAYBE IT WOULD JUST MORPH MY ACCOUNT INTO SOME OTHER ACCOUNT. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, NO, NO, I GET WHAT YOU MEAN, LIKE, YOU COULD MIX UP OUR IDENTITY OR SOMETHING. YEAH, IT'S PRETTY MUCH EXACTLY WHAT I JUST SAID. WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. WHY DON'T WE JUST CREATE AN APP LIKE THAT. OH, YOU KNOW HOW TO CODE? BUT WE'RE TAKING A COMPUTER SCIENCE CLASS, WE CAN LEARN. NO, WE CAN'T. NOT TO DO SOMETHING THAT SOPHISTICATED. WE DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND THE BOOK. YEAH, WE CAN'T EVEN UNDERSTAND THE SYLLABUS. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. DISRUPTION IS NOT AN APP. DISRUPTION IS NOT GADGET. DISRUPTION IS NOT A BUSINESS MODEL. DISRUPTION IS CATACLYSMIC CHANGE IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR BROUGHT ON BY CONSENSUS. I'M NOT DOING THE HOMEWORK, I'M JUST READING THE BOOK. YOU DIDN'T SAY I COULDN'T READ THE BOOK, IS THAT OKAY? RELAX. WHAT'S THE NAME OF THE BOOK? IT'S ON THE SYLLABUS. IT'S "PROGRAMMING SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT PLATFORMS." ARE YOU SERIOUS? - YOU'RE KIDDING. - I NEVER KID. WELL, I THINK THAT MIGHT BE A PROBLEM, JAMES. - HEY, THAT'S MINE. - WELL, IT'S A NICE PHONE CASE. - THANK YOU. - IT'S BIRDS. - MM-HMM. - IS THE BOOK HARD? I'VE READ IT BEFORE. I MEAN THE ORIGINAL EDITION. WHAT, IN THE PAST TWO WEEKS? NO, WHEN I WAS IN SIXTH GRADE. HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN CODING FOR? - SINCE I WAS SEVEN. - HMM. HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

UH, YOU HAVEN'T QUITE GOTTEN TO VOTING STATUS YET, SO FOR RIGHT NOW YOU'RE JUST CONSULTANT, OKAY? OF COURSE, YEAH. - SO, I HAVE AN IDEA. - WHOA! - HEY. - WE HAVE AN IDEA, AND WE WOULD LIKE TO HIRE YOU. TO DO WHAT? TO BUILD AN APP. WE NEED TO INTERVIEW HIM FIRST BEFORE WE GIVE HIM ANY JOB. TRUE, TRUE. HAVE YOU EVER BUILT AN APP BEFORE? YES. OKAY, WELL, TELL US ABOUT IT. - WHICH ONE? - WHOA, WHOA! WHICH ONE? LIKE THERE'S MULTIPLE APPS THAT YOU'VE MADE? UH, WELL, YEAH, I'VE BUILT 17 FOR IOS, AND 12 FOR ANDROID. OKAY, SO WHAT DO THEY DO? UH, OKAY, WELL, ONE OF THEM LEAD HOMELESS PEOPLE TO SHELTERS, ANOTHER ONE ASSISTED THE BLIND, UH, ONE PUBLIC THOROUGH FARES, ANOTHER ONE HOSTED LOCAL FOOD DRIVES, UM... OKAY, WELL, IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO DO SOMETHING THAT'S IMPORTANT. HEY, CAN YOU GUYS BELIEVE THAT THIS GENIUS IS MY ROOMMATE? I MEAN, HOW PERFECT IS THAT? OOH-HOO-HOO-HOO! THIS IS PERFECT. MM-HMM, I LOVE IT. JAMES, YOU ARE GOING TO BUILD ONE MORE APP, AND THIS APP WILL TAKE THE WORLD BY STORM. WELL, WHAT'S IT GONNA DO? JAMES, IT'S QUITE SIMPLE. WE TAKE MEN AND WOMEN AND WE PUT THEM TOGETHER SO THEY CAN MEET UP. - SO, A DATING APP. - NOT A DATING APP. HOOK-UPS. THERE'S ALREADY HOOK-UP APPS OUT THERE. NO, BUT NOT LIKE THIS ONE. WHAT'S SO DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS ONE? THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT TO BE ON THIS APP, YOU HAVE TO AGREE TO CERTAIN TERMS AND CONDITIONS THAT WILL MAKE SURE THAT YOU, ONE, DO NOT ASK FOR NAMES, TWO, YOU WILL NOT ASK TO SEE THE PERSON AGAIN, AND, THREE, BY NO MEANS, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE, WILL YOU DATE ANYBODY ON THE APP. AND THAT MEANS THAT ALL THE GUYS ARE GONNA BE ON IT. AND ALL THE GIRLS ARE GONNA HAVE TO BE ON IT IF THEY WANT TO BE WITH ANYONE. MM-HMM. OKAY, WHAT'S SO WRONG WITH A GIRL KNOWING YOUR NAME, OR EVEN WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE? WHAT'S SO BAD? WELL, I GUESS THAT'S FOR ME TO KNOW AND YOU TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO CODE. DO YOU THINK... ALL THE GIRLS WILL BE ON THE APP? OH, OKAY. SO HE DOES LIKE GIRLS. PAY UP. DUDE, I'M NOT GAY. I DO... I LIKE ONE GIRL. I'M NOT SAYING WHO IT IS. STICK AROUND, OKAY? LISTEN TO ME, AND SHE'LL BE EATING OUT OF THE PALM OF YOUR HAND. WHOA, WHOA, JAMES, JAMES, COME ON. WHERE ARE YOU GOING? COME BACK. I'LL THINK ABOUT IT. SO IT'S A MAYBE. OKAY, FINE, WELL, YOU WON FAIR AND SQUARE. PAY UP. SO, HOW WAS THE HONEYMOON? IT WAS THE BEST ONE YET. IT WAS ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS, JAMES. I TOLD HER, "JUST BRING A PASSPORT." YOU KNOW, AN ANNUAL HONEYMOON WOULD SAVE ANY MARRIAGE. I WISH YOU AND LEAH WOULD HAVE TRIED IT, HONEY. THANKS FOR THE EARLY WARNING, MOM. UH, JAMES, HAVE YOU MET ANYONE YET? YEAH, I'VE MET A LOT OF PEOPLE. ANY GIRLS? NO, DAD, I'M TRYING TO FOCUS ON MY STUDIES. I'M GONNA ASK FOR A PATERNITY TEST. HEY, I SHOULD ASK FOR A PATERNITY TEST. - OUCH! - VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE GARDENER. - OH, PHIL. - DAD, I WAS ONLY KIDDING. ME TOO, ME TOO. JAMES, IF YOU WANT ANY ADVICE ABOUT THE FAIRER SEX, YOU SHOULD ASK YOUR GRANDFATHER. THEY DON'T ACT MUCH FAIRER. YOU'RE NOT BECOMING AN ANTI-FEMINIST, ARE YOU JAMES? I DON'T KNOW GRANDPA, I'M STILL STUDYING THE SITUATION. DAD, I DON'T THINK YOUR ROMANTIC ADVICE PERTAINS TO JAMES' GENERATION. THEY'RE DOING EVERYTHING ON THEIR PHONE NOW. THAT I'D LIKE TO SEE. I MEAN, THAT'S HOW THEY MEET EACH OTHER. AND HOOK-UP WITH EACH OTHER AND BREAK-UP WITH EACH OTHER. I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU SAY, WOMEN AND MEN HAVE NOT CHANGED FOR 10,000 YEARS. PHIL... ...I'M NOT SO SURE ABOUT THAT. HMM, MAYBE A LITTLE BIT. WHAT? IS THE WELL DRY? NO, I JUST HAVE TO WAIT FOR MY DAD'S CHECK TO CLEAR. YOU THINK ABOUT MY OFFER? - TO MAKE THE HOOK-UP APP? - MM-HMM. YEAH, AND THE ANSWER IS NO, OKAY? THAT'S THE LAST THING THAT I WANT TO DO. MAYBE YOU'RE NOT THE RIGHT GUY FOR IT ANYWAY. I MEAN, IF YOU WERE SO SMART, YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED TO PRINCETON OR M.I.T., OR MAYBE EVEN HARVARD, RIGHT? I GOT INTO PRINCETON, M.I.T., HARVARD, AND STANFORD. OH, YEAH, THEN WHY AREN'T YOU THERE? BECAUSE... MY PARENTS DON'T HAVE THE MONEY. YEAH, WELL IF YOU WERE SO SMART, I'M SURE YOU'D HAVE A SCHOLARSHIP, RIGHT? THE IVYS DON'T GIVE ACADEMIC SCHOLARSHIPS AND WITH MY FAMILY'S BUSINESS, IT JUST... YOU KNOW WHAT? NEVER MIND. JAMES, I AM YOUR SAVING GRACE. I MEAN, IF YOU DO THIS APP, I WILL GIVE YOU ALL THE MONEY TO GO TO WHEREVER YOU WANT TO GO FOR SCHOOLING. THINK ABOUT IT. YOU'LL BE LIKE STEVE JOBS OR STEVE WOZNIAK. BILL GATES AND PAUL ALLEN. MATT DAMON AND BEN AFFLECK. LET ME KNOW. OKAY? SO, UH, WHAT TIME IS YOUR NEXT CLASS? AN HOUR. YEAH? I NEED MY DESK AND MY CHAIR. WELL, THIS ISN'T GONNA TAKE LONG, RIGHT? IT'S QUICK. WELL I NEED IT NOW IF YOU WANT MY HELP. WAIT, HOLD ON, YOU DECIDED TO DO IT? WELL, THERE ARE CONDITIONS. LIKE, NO GIRLS, NO PARTIES, NO STAYING UP UNTIL 3:00 AM WITH FRIENDS. THIS WILL BECOME A CODING SANCTUARY. OH, NO, NO, NO. WAIT, WAIT, WAIT! WHY CAN'T YOU JUST CODE IN THE STUDY ROOM DOWN THE HALL? - NO. - WELL, I NEED MY ROOM, DUDE. WELL, I NEED MY ROOM. OKAY, WAIT! YES, YES, YEAH, YEAH, YOU CAN CODE IN HERE. WILL YOU ALSO MAKE ME BREAKFAST? NO, I WILL NOT MAKE YOU BREAKFAST, JAMES. BUT SHE SERIOUSLY DOES HAVE TO GO. YEAH, OKAY, YOU HEARD THE MAN. TIME TO SKEDADDLE, GET OUT. - WILL YOU CALL ME LATER? - PROBABLY NOT. HE WON'T. OKAY, I'LL COME BY AFTER CLASS. NO, NO, NO, JAMES AND I HAVE VERY IMPORTANT WORK TO DO AND WE NEED PEACE AND QUIET, BUT, THANK YOU. SERIOUSLY. I HAVE ONE MORE CONDITION. I ALREADY TOLD YOU, I'M NOT MAKING BREAKFAST FOR YOU IN BED. IT'S NOT THAT. I WANT TO DO THIS ANONYMOUSLY. WELL, THEN WHO IS GONNA TAKE THE CREDIT FOR DEVELOPING THE APP? WELL, CONSIDERING I HAVE NOT BEEN ACCORDED VOTING RIGHTS, STILL. I WOULD SAY, YOU WOULD TAKE THE CREDIT. WHO? ME? - YEAH, YOU. - WHY? BECAUSE I DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW I'M A PART OF THIS. WHAT PEOPLE DON'T YOU WANT TO KNOW THAT YOU'RE A PART OF THIS APP? MY MOTHER, FOR ONE. OH! WAIT, WE CAN'T TELL MOMMY? WHY NOT? OKAY, DO YOU WANT MY HELP OR NOT? YEAH, NO, YEAH, OBVIOUSLY. THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT. LET'S GET STARTED. I FELT LIKE IT WAS A BAPTISM. HEY, WHERE'VE YOU GUYS BEEN? OH, UH... WE'VE BEEN STUDYING. FOR REAL? UH-HUH. YEAH, WE'RE ACTUALLY CODING A NEW BREAKTHROUGH PROJECT. MM-HMM, AND IT'LL BE OUT SOON, LADIES, SO DON'T FRET.

AND I CAN'T CODE ANONYMOUSLY EXCEPT FOR IN THIS ROOM, AND I CAN'T CODE AT ALL UNLESS THIS IS MY SANCTUARY. OKAY, THEN WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO HERE? I'D LIKE A TURKEY AND SWISS ON RYE WITH LETTUCE, TOMATO, AND MAYONNAISE, PLEASE. OH, AND BY THE WAY, I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU WANTED ME TO DO WITH THIS. THAT'S PERFECT RIGHT THERE, AND I AM NOT GONNA BE YOUR WAITER. - DUDE. - WAIT... OKAY, FINE! UNLESS IT KEEPS YOU FROM CODING, SIT DOWN. DO YOUR THING. UH, AND WHAT LANGUAGE ARE WE DOING THIS IN?

OH, OKAY, IT WAS NOT A RESTRAINING ORDER, IT WAS A... A COUNSELOR'S EVALUATION. A COUNSELOR'S EVALUATION TO STOP BREAKING INTO JUSTIN'S NEW APARTMENT. I WANT MY CHINA BACK. WE NEED TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE SUPPORTIVE AND GIVE HER SOME CREDIT. SHE HASN'T BROKEN INTO JUSTIN'S APARTMENT SINCE SHE STARTED THE MEDICATION. I JUST CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE JUSTIN WITH A GIRLFRIEND. JUST SAYING THE WORDS, "JUSTIN'S GIRLFRIEND," BLEGH. I THINK IT'S GOOD THAT WE HAVE THE EXES AT THE HOLIDAY DINNER. I MEAN, WE'RE ALL STILL A FAMILY. BUT YOU'RE DIVORCED.

ONLY FOR A FEW HOURS, HOPEFULLY. MAYBE HE CAN HELP US STUDY? HAVE A BETTER IDEA, IF YOU MAKE US AN APP, LIKE, "JUNGLE FOR GIRLS" I JUST MIGHT LET YOU STAY HERE. IT'S A GOOD IDEA. "JUNGLE" REALLY MESSED ME UP. GUYS, WE KNOW THAT LANCE MADE "JUNGLE" AND WE'RE GONNA MAKE HIM REGRET IT. YES, AND I'M KIND OF RETIRING FROM APPS FOR NOW. OKAY, SO THE ANSWER IS NO. I MEAN, RIGHT AFTER I MAKE YOUR APP. I THOUGHT HE WAS FIXING "JUNGLE." YEAH, THAT'S WHAT HE SAID HE WAS DOING, MAN. WHERE IS HE, LANCE? THIS IS KIND OF AN EMERGENCY.

GUYS NOWADAYS DON'T DATE YOU. - THEY JUST SLEEP WITH YOU. - THEN LET'S CHANGE THAT. - HOW? - WITH MY APP AND WITH YOUR COOPERATION. AND THE COOPERATION OF YOUR SISTERS ON EVERY COLLEGE CAMPUS. HANNAH? WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE IDEA? DO YOU LIKE IT? HONESTLY, NO, I DON'T. I DON'T THINK THAT AN APP IS THE PROPER SOLUTION FOR RELATIONSHIPS. I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE I WAS JUST BORN IN THE WRONG CENTURY. I AGREE. NO WONDER YOU HAVE NO CLUE WHAT'S GOING ON. OH, THERE HE IS. - HEY, GUYS. - WHERE YOU BEEN, MAN? UH, MEETING. HEY, YOU'RE GROUNDED UNTIL "JUNGLE" IS FIXED - WHAT? - YEP. I'M TRYING TO GET IT BACK UP, GUYS. I CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. WHILE YOU'RE HAVING A HARD TIME, I'M GETTING DEATH THREATS FOR TAKING DOWN THE HOOKUP APPS. PEOPLE THINK I DID IT AS A PUBLICITY STUNT. THEY THINK THAT HE BUILT THE APP 'CAUSE HE DIDN'T. THAT'S WHY IT'S FUNNY. THEY THINK THAT I BUILT "JUNGLE." THEY THINK THAT I CAN TAKE DOWN THE HOOKUP APPS. YEAH, YOU DIDN'T BUILD "JUNGLE," THOUGH. NO, I CREATED IT. IT WAS MY IDEA. SHH.
