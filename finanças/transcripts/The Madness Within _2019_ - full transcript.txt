There's a strange comfort and solitude. As I stare into a world of emptiness, a world without meaning or purpose, I often wonder, how did it come to this? Was it her? April? Her name is April. Was it any of them? Was it my parents? No. That'd be too easy. Deep down I know the truth. It eats at me like a cancer. Denial is not just a river in Egypt. And I'll be honest, it was me. It's a moot fucking point, man. The city is not gonna let us show tits just for the sake of showing tits. Don't kid yourself. Everyone loves a great fucking pair of tits, man. Even the pope would motorboat if he had a chance. Why do I listen to you? 'Cause I'm right. And 'cause I have this. Ooh. My hero. Seriously? You're just gonna do that like in the open? Nobody cares. Oh my God. This is awkward. Oh, sorry darling. Not before the street lights come up for me. It's got to be midnight somewhere, right? It is. Just not here, love. Excuse me. Would you stop giving away my drugs? And can we get back to the subject? Oh quit being such a cheapskate. All right, where were we? Tits! We were talking about fucking tits. Jesus Christ, I feel like I don't even know you anymore, man. Right, tits. Are you kidding me? What? Just give me the shit so I can go and take a piss. Damn. Hey. Hey yourself. So what's your name? April. Oh that's pretty, kind of like the month. Perceptive one, aren't we? I try. I'm Russ. Oh I know who you are. Do you now? You're Russ Washington. You used to date my friend Julia Stiles. Oh, right, Julia, yeah. How's she doing? You have no idea who I'm talking about, do you? Not a fucking clue. Quite the asshole, aren't we? That would be one way of putting it. Oh you have another way, I assume? Nothing I really feel like sharing at the moment. So listen, tonight, I'm probably gonna be... Holy shit. That waitress is a fucking nug, man. A nug? Yeah, as in a fucking nugget? Oh, right. A fucking nugget, okay. What, you got her number? Fucking A I got her number. I'm gonna do shit to her that'd make a porn star blush. You really are a degenerate. So about tonight, listen, I was just saying. Can't have that now, can we? Text me the details about tonight. What the fuck was that? All right, guys. We got to cheers to the four of us! Fuck yes! Yes, bitch. Yes! I have a great idea. See, you take a little of this, you know what I mean? And we place it like right here. And then you get to lick it off, yeah. Oh, love that. This right here is like an explosion of fucking sex and money. It is. Isn't it? - Don't you think so, babe? - Yeah. I mean look at this. Look, I'm in heaven. - You are in heaven. - I am in heaven. You have two fucking angels right next to you. Oh my God. And you have two little devils. See what I mean, know what I mean? Wow, wow. Hey, when the fuck is the after-party, right? Scoot up, miss. Really? That'll be later. Excuse me. Oh my God. Hey, listen. My hottie in pink, I promised her a part in a movie in a private audition. What part, what audition? Exactly. There is no fucking part. 'Cause she deserves me. 'Cause she deserves my fucking part. Fuck, dude. Dude that's disgusting. No it's not. It's Picasso. Imagine me inside of her. That's it, bro. All right, I need a smoke, I need a smoke. I got a joint. No, a fucking cigarette. Dude, just smoke here, man. Why can't you find a smoke here? We paid for this shit, just smoke. No. That Molly's starting to hit, let me get some fresh air. Don't be a fucking pussy, man. - Yeah you're being a pussy. - Yeah don't be a pussy. Yeah, come on. I'm good. - I'm good. - Yeah it's fine. Woo, party! So I'm not like supposed to leave money on the counter or anything, am I? Is that what you heard? What I've heard? I don't know anything about you. Sometimes it's better that way. I'm gonna take a shower. Oh, you're gonna need a towel, they're right over... I'm sure I can find them. But I will need someone to wash my back. Oh fuck. That was vigorous. Is that your idea of pillow talk? I'm sorry, I didn't realize that awkward moment after you've just had sex with a complete stranger is still called pillow talk in some cultures. Oh, is that right? Yeah. Okay. Well ask me something then. Oh I think I know your story. Doubt it. Let's see. Big fish from a small pond. Probably prom queen too. Took some drama classes, figured hey I'll move out to Los Angeles, become a movie star. 'Cause we all know how easy it is, right? You can't help it, can you? What's that? Being an asshole. I always got to be something. Well if you must know, my parents died when I was 14. Oh, well that got intense. How did they die? Car accident. That's weird. My parents, no, my dad, he actually died the same way. Drunk driver. He was hit by a drunk driver? He was the drunk driver. - Oh. - Yeah. Then like two and a half years ago my mom passed away from cancer and ever since then Marcus has been like the only family I have. Like a little brother you never wanted? Like the harpy that won't go away. Then what'd you do after they passed away? Oh I moved in with my aunt and my uncle. And they're the ones that encouraged me to move out here and chase my dreams. I'm glad they did. Where are you going? Oh fuck. You just could, where'd you fucking come from? Yeah, what's up, man? Where the fuck did you disappear last night, Cinderella? Something came up. Oh yeah? How big something? About eight inches? Yeah atta fucking boy. Who was it? Della the waitress who kept giving you the beat-my-twaddle-with-a-stick eyes? Beat my what? No dude, the girl from lunch. You fucked my nugget, you piece of shit? No, man, April. Who the fuck is April? Look, never mind. I'll be there in 10 minutes. Do you mind covering for me? Oh fuck, man, I haven't even left yet. You're joking, right? Look, gentlemen, I assure you he'll be here any moment. How are we supposed to expect you and your partner to run a set when neither one of you can show up on time for a simple meeting? Look, Mr... Clearly, clearly you're unable to deliver on this. Hey guys, please excuse my tardiness. God forgive me Laurel's bumper to bumper. Really? Jim, I get it, I really do. Excuses are like assholes. And that's not the point. Let's just get down to brass tacks, shall we? Yeah? So early pre sale estimates put it at 22 million. Worldwide? That's just foreign. What's domestic? 18. Who's the female lead? Stella Avalon. Has she signed on? As of yesterday. Male? Max Wellington. What's the waterfall? As usual, first in, first out. Well? Seems like a win-win. Nice. Well, you know, like they say, Kettle ain't steamin', there's no tea. And I'm not one for an audience to be parched. I'll have my legal contact yours. Start work on the long form. Sounds good. Thank you. Are you fucking kidding me? Did you just get us a 50 million dollar budget? Well, someone's got to keep us afloat, huh? Oh shoot. Why the fuck didn't you just tell me Stella signed on, bro? Well she hasn't yet. But now that the money's there, she will. Well and the fact that you used to fuck her kinda helps. Well yeah, a bit. You know what this means, right? Yo, yo, yo, 50 fucking million dollars, baby! What the fuck are you doing? The fuck does it look like I'm doing, man? I'm celebrating. Hey, hey, hey, what did I say? You need to relax. Yeah, yeah, he said wait till the check deposits in the bank and then we say the money clear, and then we can fucking, would you fucking relax and enjoy yourself for once, bro? - She's enjoying, right? - I am. The three of us are enjoying it. He's not. Listen, before we do some shit I got some amazing shit from Dracula. - Oh do you? - Fuck, yes. Oh you're gonna love this, babe. No shit, you're gonna come like a motherfucker in this. Check this out. You're gonna take one. And you're gonna take one. And I'll take two. Because I can. Russ, you remember Sarah, don't you? It's Jessica. Exactly, who gives a shit? And this is Lariana. She's from North... North Dakota. I was Miss North Dakota actually. - Really? - Yes! And how old are you? Well, I'll be... Oh, she's old enough. Yeah, she's a fucking virgin. - Yeah right. - Yeah right. A virgin? North Dakota? North. Hate to break it to you but all that means is she can outrun her brother. So you guys make movies, huh? That's so cool. I moved out here because... All your friends said you should be in movies? Yeah I know. Listen sweetheart, riveting story. Fill me in on the ending later, yeah? All right, come on. This way, this way, move over. Sarah. Jessica. Who gives a shit? Guys, I see a fucking foursome here. You guys see it? I fucking see it. This guy. Well look who's gracing us with their presence. It's the 50 million dollar man. Chris. So when do you guys start shooting? First of the year. Check this one out. Huh, fucked her last week. She just left. How do you know her? You know her too? We've been out. God damn, now I know I'm special. How is that? Well if I'm banging the same hooker as a 50 million dollar man, I must be doing okay. - Hey! - Lady has a fucking name! What's your problem? Say it again, call her a fucking hooker again! Jenny's a fucking hooker, man, what the fuck? Wait, who? Jenny. Whatever the fuck her name is. April, her name is fucking April. Jesus Christ. You didn't know. You didn't know she's a fucking hooker. Fuck you. - See you. - See ya. What are you doing? Gee, I don't know, trying to figure out if the girl I fucked last night without a condom's a hooker or not? What the fuck did you just say? Are you a fucking hooker? Where to? Shut the fuck up. Who the fuck do you think you are embarrassing me like that? What do you wanna know? Why I fuck people for money? Well your name would be a start. April, my name is fucking April. Okay, April, are you a fucking hooker? Yes, all right? My name's Ryan. Shut the fuck up! So what, you didn't think it was necessary to tell me you'll fuck anyone with a dollar bill in the hotel room? No! Why the fuck not?! Because I liked you, okay? Come on. What do you want me to say? Yes, like every other dipshit that's a big fish from a small pond, I'm moved out to L.A. to be a star and it didn't work out. That I had no idea what I was getting myself into and I failed. Or rather go back to a home that was never a fucking home, I'd rather sell my body to the highest bidder just so I can stay out here and try to convince myself I'm living the dream. You could have just said you're a whore. Stop the fucking car! - I liked you, okay? - Oh, come on. I'm sorry you made me feel how I did before my life fell apart. This isn't fucking Pretty Woman. No, it's not. I might sell my body so I don't have to go home but at least I'm not a piece of shit who rips people off to pay for a life they don't deserve. Listen to that shit. Could have just said you're a whore! Fuck you! You know in some countries... Dude, just shut the fuck up and drive. All right, fresh nuggets, welcome to the casa. Come on blonde, get in. There we go. Give us the hand please. And lest find this Russ. Look what Daddy brought home, Russ! Where the fuck is he? Russ, I got some nugget for us. Two, I have a bottle. Dude please tell me she wasn't a fucking hooker, please. Seriously, now's not the fucking time, dude. - Russ. - Marcus. All right, fine, breathe, breathe. Look what Daddy brought home, hmm? Why would you ever pay for it? What makes you think I do? Marcus, let's go! Come on, get up. We got to go. Come on, man. Oh fuck, no, man. I need like another hour or something. Are you fucking kidding me, dude? Really? Fucking vodka, dude? Shit. Get you wet? Hey Lily, it's Russ Washington. And Marcus, tell her it's Marcus. Who? Russ Washington. Please, I asked you not to call me. Do not call me and shut your mouth when you're talking to me because I do not want to hear a word you have to say. You have so compromised my reputation. You have so humiliated me and I cannot believe that you would even call me again or have the nerve to! Hey, you came to my hotel room. I liked it. How do you have the nerve to call me? How do you really have the nerve to call me? I cannot believe and you talk as if it's perfectly all right for you to call me. Your voice is mellifluous and soft. And you're just like we're the best of friends, you have so completely... You said you weren't gonna make a big deal about this. Listen, we got a movie coming up and we'd love if you'd come out for it. Give you... 40 grand, that'd work? Cash? Yeah, yeah cash. Text me the address. You know I love you. Perfect, yes. Listen, if you wanna do it again, just next time, tell me, bye. Yeah. Yes! Press one now. This is Russ. Hi. Who's this? Me. Ah, me who? Me. That's right, Jennifer, wasn't it? Can we talk? I thought that's what we're doing. No, in person. You know I'm actually right in the middle of something right now with my partner. I don't think it's a good idea. Please. I really don't know what you're expecting to say here. Well I just want you to hear me out. I'm listening. I wasn't trying to deceive you. Okay, right. What would you call that then? Well excuse me if I didn't feel like telling you that I'm a fucking hooker the first night we sleep together. So wait, that's your insane logic? The first night, hmm? Like any other fucking night would have made that okay? Well, I don't know what you want me to say. Tell me what I can do to fix this. Not a fucking thing. Please? Fucking crazy? What the fuck am I doing? You can't do this in here! Out in a minute! This is a family fucking restaurant! Baby, open up. That voice. That terribly beautiful voice reminds me, reminds me of things I'd rather forget. He said we just lost half of our light. Call Michael at Universal. He owes me a favor. Okay. Russ, Russ? - Knock, knock. - Russ! This is bullshit! And that director doesn't know his ass from a hole in the ground. And it's fucking with my chi! Your chi? Let me just, let me just... Don't fucking touch me! Calm down, you'll look different, okay? Please, sit down. This is not fucking worth it. It never is. Easy, Weinstein. Hey Russ. Coming poker night? High rollers, baby. I don't play with Russians. Russ. Can we please put... Not a fucking chance, deal with it. This is Russ. Yes, Mr. Lowenstein. No, I completely understand. No, I get it sir, it's not gonna be an issue. I understand, I got it. Okay. What? Really, for breakfast? Beats coffee. I guess so. Ah. So that was the studio, I take it? No, that was the fucking studio head. Really? What does he want? Oh just to remind us on the first day of shooting we're a week behind schedule. Big deal, when does a shooting happen on schedule? When it's being run properly? What the fuck can they do about it? Did you even read through our contracts? Yes. I mean I mainly browsed through 'em but yeah. So I take it you missed the part that states if we're more than three weeks behind schedule the bond company they hired can come in here, fire both of us and take the film. Shit. Shit is right. Basically that would mean no more four million dollar paycheck. The chances of us ever getting another film this size with any studio will be fuck all, and, essentially we'd be fucked. Hey, so about tonight. Hey seriously, don't even start that shit. Look, it's just... Last time that sneaky fucking Russian took you for 400 grand, I'm not going. It was a bad beat, bro. Bad beat, act of God, I don't give a fuck. I'm not bailing you out again. It's not gonna fucking happen again. I got it all planned out, you'll see. You know I'm starting to think you got a problem. Well look who's talking. Yeah well, it's do what I say not do what I do. Yeah, right. I've heard that before. I've said it before. So what are you gonna do then? Actually it looks like I've got plans. What? The hooker? Hey, I said you need to stop with that shit, I'm serious. Okay, okay, I'm sorry. Oh shit. Oh yeah 'cause I mean we all know that you can make a nice housewife out of a whore. Get the-! Hey, you've reached April's voice mail. Sorry I missed your call. Leave me a message and I'll get back to you later. Bye. Babe, it's me. Took off work early so I should be home shortly. Whenever you're done, come on you fucking morons, sorry about that. Whenever you're done, just feel free to come on over. I'm gonna order some food and yeah look forward to seeing ya. 200. Call. Another 200. Call. Check. All in, baby. I call. Gentleman shows four aces. Hate to say it to you babe, but I think this is going home with me, buddy. Now sweetheart, did you ever have a fucking millionaire before? 'Cause I wanna fuck you so bad. Uh uh uh uh uh. Not so fast. Gentleman shows a royal flush. Oh shit. If I'm not mistaken, that's 1.3 million you owe me. I think I'm gonna be sick. All this action just got me real hungry. Sergei, bring me some mezze. Just bring me something. You may square up with Yuri. Look, Vic. I'm gonna need like two weeks, man. I can't just give it to you all at once. I like you, Marcus. I really do. You're a good customer. Because you're a good customer, I give you a week to come up with the rest. A week, I mean that's not enough... Or there's always option B. That's fine. You're welcome. Look, and eat something, would you? You look really pale. Hey, you've reached April's voice mail. Sorry I missed your call. Leave me a message and I'll get back to you later. There he is. So? So what? How'd you do? Eh, you know. Not bad? Marcus. So how was your night? Or should I say the lady of the night? Hey, I warned you about that. So how we doing? As of today we are exactly a week and a day behind schedule so not fucking good. Director? Who else? What a fuck bag, man. Yeah well, it's not your career on the line. You don't exactly care, now, do ya? Hey so when are we getting our next check from the studio? How bad? Nothing I can't handle. - Marcus. - Relax, mother. Nothing to concern yourself with. Now if you'll excuse me, I must see my deuce. Oh hey, pretty woman. Where's Kit? Where's Kit? Ignore him. Real fucking cute. Oh goddamn, there's a lawsuit in the making. So what's up? Well, you haven't been returning any of my texts so you tell me. Well I'm just busy, busy, busy. Seriously? You're gonna stick to that or you gonna talk to me like an adult? Okay. What happened last night? - What do you mean? - What do you mean? Let's see. Hey babe, with Kim. See you soon, love you, bye. Nothing. I'm sorry, is that funny to you somehow? No, it's not. But you still worrying the way you do is. Yeah well excuse me if getting blown off isn't exactly amusing to me. Russ. So where were you? She was having a nervous breakdown so I just crashed at her place. Did you? Yeah, I tried to call you. Oh that's funny. No missed calls on my phone. Well it went straight to voice mail. Oh God, isn't that convenient? Are you trying to imply something? Is there something I should be implying here? You need to grow the fuck up, Russ. Excuse me, don't try to turn this shit around on me. You're the one that out last night doing God knows what with who the fuck knows? Out doing God knows what with who the fuck knows? Ugh, you're an asshole. Or was it doing who fucking knows? You know what, fuck you, Russ. How dare you accuse me of shit. Yeah, well, you know what? One of us did use to be a comfort girl sweetheart and it wasn't me. Ow, yeah, fucking classy. You know what, fuck you Russ. Why don't you call me when you figure out what you want? I already know that. Is a trustworthy relationship too much to fucking ask for? A trustworthy relationship? Mhmm. You're seriously fucked up, you know that? You don't want a relationship because you thrive on this bullshit drama. You just want company. Well I got 50 bucks, is that enough? Welcome to Hollywood. Everyone's a hooker in one way or another. You know in film school, they... Just shut the fuck up and get me some coffee. - Yes sir. - Goddamn. Yeah, let me deliver my lines so that I can act! If I can't deliver my lines, how can I act? What is the issue? - What is the issue? - You're insane. - What is the issue? - I want to be able to say whatever I want. You should let me say whatever I want. That's just the way that I work. It's the way that I work. You have to deal with it. It's in my fucking contract! You wanna be a star? You wanna be a... Strap! You wanna be a star, you wanna be a star? Get your ass in the car! Aw, how you doing? Not that fucking good. God damn. Jesus, what? Have you seen Marcus lately? Here's that coffee, Mr. Washington. Seriously? That's like two fucking hours ago. Oh no, what the fuck is this? This is only good. No, I have two of those already. Hold on. I understand you're interested, but this is a closed set. I cannot have - you come any further. - I understand you're just doing your job but this is, No, I need you to go. It's okay, I got it. Mr. Russ. Victor? So why do I have the honor of your company today, huh? Well this, this is what brings me here. You know I always had interest in movie business. Oh is that right? If I say it is, yes. How's this then? Tell me, where's Marcus? Marcus? Yes, Marcus. You know, it's funny you should ask actually. He's not coming in today. Had to take a couple of our clients down town, show 'em around, you know. I'm here if you need anything though. Nah, nothing important. Just wanted to say hello. I'll make sure to let him know you did. Just tell him, four days. Four days until? Good to see you, Mr. Russ. Stop by the game sometime. Dude, you wanna get in on this? Grab someone in case we run out of balls. Get the fuck out. What the fuck, man? Now. What the fuck is your problem, man? She's an extra. What the fuck is my problem? Victor just paid us a visit, that's my fucking problem! Victor? Oh, he did? Yeah, he did. Him and one of those fucking meatheads. What'd you do, Marcus? What'd he say? What do you think he said? Nothing, that's how I know it's fucked. Well it's nothing I can't handle. Nothing you can't handle? Now why do I have some fucking madman, someone who kills people for a living stopping by my set asking for you? It's nothing I can't handle, man. I've got this. You fucking better, 'cause you know what? We're on the verge of losing this film 'cause of some shitbag director, and the last thing I... I got it, it's fine man, I got this! Okay? You think I'm gonna risk our job, let alone our friendship? You have before. Yeah well that was then. Okay, relax. And fucking trust me on this. Look what happened last time I did. Hey hon, it's me. Listen, I'm sorry if I overreacted earlier. I'm just, between Marcus, the film, everything else in this. I was kind of losing grasp right now, so, please just give me a call when you get a chance, all right? Okay I'll talk to you soon. Hey. Hey yourself. Everything okay? Why don't you tell me? Okay. Is something going on I don't know about? That's fine, you took the words right out of my mouth. Are you serious right now, this again? Am I serious? Yeah, I'm fucking serious. What the fuck is going on with you? Me? What the fuck is going on with you? Gee, let's fucking break this down real quick, shall we? I'm about to lose the biggest film of my fucking career. My best friend/business partner, this fucking mobster is coming by my set because he's a degenerate gambler. Oh and the best part, the one you're really gonna like is, the girl I'm in love with who's supposed to be my fucking girlfriend is probably out there fucking hooking again! Other than that I'm peach though. Thanks for asking. Don't fucking do this. Shh. It's okay. It's not okay. Still wanna talk? Hey hon? Yes? I'm thinking about ordering some food. You hungry at all? I could eat. From where? Probably just the usual I guess. Can you make sure they bring ranch this time? Mhmm. Dude, please tell me she wasn't a fucking hooker, please. Jesus Christ, you didn't know. Oh yeah 'cause I mean we all know that you can make a nice housewife out of a whore. Give me my key, get the fuck out of my room. No, why don't you talk to me like an adult and tell me what's wrong instead of throwing a fucking tantrum like a child!? Okay, you want me to act like an adult? That's what you want? Let me see your phone. What? Give me your fucking phone! No, why? Stop! Oh, let's see here. Oh there it is. Roosevelt Hotel, three p.m., room 104. Bring your red fucking heels. Russ, I, Give me my room key - and get the fuck out of here. - No please, - can you just let me explain? - You dirty fucking whore. Get the fuck out! Go. Key? What? Nothing. What? Hey, I said nothing. Why are you sitting there staring at me like you just found out I have two dicks or something? You have two dicks? Really? Dude are they like over each other? They got to be. 'Cause if they are, I would milk the shit out of them. Like I'll fucking go to town, man. Dude seriously, shut the fuck up. You gonna beat around the bush or just say it? Dude. I kept telling you, once a whore, always a fucking whore. Ah well, what can I say? It was never meant to be. I have my cancer, she's a whore. Well I'm just saying man, it's... Listen I can truly give a shit what the fuck you're saying right now 'cause the last person I'm taking any advice from is you. Where's that extra of yours at? Who? You know, the one you were fucking when I covered for you with Victor? Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, that woman. I fucking fired her. You fired her? Fucking yeah I fired her. And why may I ask did you fire an extra you fucked on our set knowing full well she'd report that and have proof? Our asses are getting sued. Relax. You didn't hear the shit she was saying, man. She basically fired her fucking self. Oh yeah, well try me, what was she saying? So get this. We're at the store buying a morning after pill. Wait, you didn't use a fucking condom? No. She's fucking 18 man, they can't catch shit that young. Oh my God, you're fucking insane. Actually, yeah, that's when they contract shit, you moron. Fuck. Maybe that's why my balls are all numb. Yeah, probably, you fucking idiot. Well whatever, anyways. She was saying how last Halloween, she was at this fucking party, and her and her friends, You ready to have some fun now? Yes. Oh my God. I feel I'm gonna be sick. Oh my God, oh no, no no. So she shit herself. Shit her britches right in the fucking costume, man. So you stopped fucking this girl just 'cause she got drunk at some party and accidentally crapped her pants? What? No, I stopped fucking her 'cause I was over it, man. I fired her 'cause she shit herself. Oh Jesus Christ, Marcus. Look, enough about hookers and little Bo Poopy Pants. Have I got something in store for you tonight. Are you fucking insane? You really think I'm going out with you when we're about to lose this film? And that's exactly why we got to do this, man! Not to mention my cousin just got out of prison and I wanna show him a good time tonight. Dude, I'm not, wait, what the fuck did you just say prison? What the fuck was he in prison for? Is he dangerous? Dangerous? No, he's not fucking dangerous, dude. He got busted for breaking into people's homes and giving them blowjobs while they fucking slept. Look, now will you rub some dirt on your vagina and get back in the fucking game? I'm not fucking going. Holy shit. That was good. That's just what I needed, Marcus. So whose party is this anyways? Oh you just wait and see, my friend. But before we go in I got a little special thing for us. Nice. Dude. I'm good. Oh no, this isn't coke. This is Ketamine. Special K? Fuckin' A. All right, goddamn. Come on. Let me have that shit. All right, slow down. Look, this ain't coke, man. This shit'll floor you down, man. Yeah, thanks mother, I'm good. Let me get in on that shit. Oh, fuck. That is some good shit. I swear to God. I come up with some of the best ideas in my life when I'm fucked up. Is that right? So were you fucked up then when you had the great idea to break in guys' houses and go ahead and suck... That's good, man, it really is. You see Russ here, he makes dreams come true. Oh all right. Throw us some gospel, Ed. All right, all right, check this shit out. You know that app, Tinder? Sure. I use it every night. All right, well check this. We make one for girls 12 to 17 and we call that shit, and we call that shit Tender. What do you think about that? So we going in this place or what? Yeah, yeah, we're going. But listen, before we go in, you guys have to put these on. You're joking, right? Dude, I feel fucking ridiculous. Just trust me on this one, all right? I'm fucking pumped. Password? Humphrey Bogart. Humphrey Bogart? Right this way, gentlemen. Hey sexy, how are you? I see what I'm getting into. Don't worry about him, he'll be fine. Okay. So what comes next? Hopefully, you. Dirty. And your name is? No names. Okay. So what's your name? No names. Okay, what am I supposed to call you in the heat of the moment then? Scorpion. Okay. Uh uh uh, not till later. What the fuck? Dude, that's okay. Russ. Don't fucking talk to me. Whoah, chill out man, you just fucked her. Just do a few lines and go again. Wait, do you know each other? No. I don't know this fucking bitch. Russ, let me explain. Explain what? Are you some fucking party favor at Fuckfest 14? Fuck you. Hey! Oh shut the fuck up and do some more coke, you whore. What the fuck? We're done. Get the fuck. Marcus! Marcus! Hey! That motherfucker just hit me. Now what the fuck are you gonna do? Hey! Where the hell you going, man? This place is, Jesus fucking Christ, man, what happened to you? You did, you fucking cancer! Me? Every time, every fucking time I listen to one of your fucktarded ideas some shit like this happens. Dude, I don't understand, man. Of course you don't. You really don't fucking get it, do you? You are like some plague sent here to be the bane of my fucking existence. Stop that guy, he was trying to suck my dick! No I didn't! The bane of? It means that all the fucked up shit that happens in my life stems from the fact that I got a piece of shit like you involved in it. I tell you what. I am fucking done. I am done with that, I'm finished. Is that what this is about? The hooker? God damn it! Like you're any fucking better. It's a funny thing, the beginning of the end. You never even know it's begun until it's over. What, fucking idiot. Is this your idea of a fucking joke? Dude, it's fucking bad, man. Chair is comfy. Hope you don't mind, I parked in your spot. You call this an office? That'll be enough, Chris. Mr. Lowenstein. What did I tell you, Russ? Sir, please, you don't understand. We're dealing with... Shut up, Marcus. At least one of you has common sense. I'm sorry, who are you? I apologize. My name is Jennifer Foster. I represent the bond company that's prepared to take this film out of your incapable hands. Sir, I understand. Russ. That's good stuff. What did I tell you? - I believe Mr. - Lowenstein and I, Excuse me, Miss Foster. I'm speaking to Mr. Washington. Russ? You said if I couldn't get things under control you'd find someone who could. Did you? No, sir, I didn't. Russ, do I seem like the type of a person who makes idle threats? No, sir. You leave me no choice. I understand the position I've put you in. I take full responsibility. I'm sorry, kid. I like you, I really do. But this is business. You don't fucking get it, do you? I mean he's done everything... Marcus. Fuck this, man. Now Mr. Washington, if you'd be so kind. What's this? Just protocol. It states that you knowingly in good measure relinquish all your rights to appeal our decision. Jennifer, was it? - Miss Foster will do. - I know. Okay. With all due respect Miss Foster, go fuck your hand. I'm so sorry. Russ, I'm sorry you got fired. Give me a... Fucking hack. Dude, Russ. I don't know what... You never fucking do, do you? Please! Please what? What, you got some words that are gonna fix it? Magic wand hidden up your ass gonna make it better? I'm sorry... You're goddamn right you are! I told you this was gonna happen, I fucking warned you! And what was your response? Oh I got this great party to go to. And that's your fucking problem. You don't take anything seriously and now we're both fucked. You know what though, I'm sorry too. Sorry I was ever stupid enough to think a piece of shit like you could comprehend, let alone care about anything that wasn't yourself. Is there anything I can... Okay, read my mind, Marcus. What? You wanna know what you can do, read my mind. - I... - Can't? Not working for you? Let me give you a hint. It's saying get the fuck out of my way and stay the fuck out of my life! God damn. Fuck off. Come on, are you fucking kidding me? Fuck off. Fuck's sake, fuck off! Come on! Haven't you fucking done enough? Mr. Washington. Yeah. This is Victor. How'd you get this number? I was very sorry to hear about your situation. So sad, I mean what do they say, if it was easy... Everyone would do it. So I guess it's a good thing I saved my money. You know Vic, it's not that I don't appreciate your concern, just really not in the mood to play cards right now, you know what I mean? Not to worry. Maybe next time? However I do have something that might hold your interest. Yeah, what's that? Russ. Would you like a drink, Mr. Russ? A vodka perhaps? I'm fine. You all right? He's fine. We've just been talking. Best there is, Turkish espresso. Can wake the dead. So they say. You know, with all due respect, Vic, let me just cut through the bullshit here. Straight to business. I like that. Russ, I... Marcus, shut the fuck up. So what's it gonna cost to fix this? I like you, Mr. Russ. A true no-nonsense man. Let's call it 600. 600 thousand dollars? I understand your predicament. This is not your debt to pay. There are other options. Such as? Look, Russ, please, please. Come on, come on. You're gonna have to give me a day on this. You have one hour. Are you fucking kidding me? Is that a problem? Yeah Vic, it's a fucking problem. Don't exactly carry that kind of cash on me, do I? Not something I could run down to the ATM for. No problem. I accept transfer. Isn't that fucking convenient? Everything. What? Everything. I don't know what... That's what knowing you has cost me, Marcus. Every fucking thing! Russ... It's my fault, really. It's not like I can blame you. It's like they say, insanity is doing the same thing over and fucking over and over and over again expecting a different fucking result. It's my fault for letting a fucking piece of shit keep making their way back into my life. Knowing that no matter what, the inevitable will happen. Wait, what are you doing? Where are we going? I can't, bro. Oh, that's where you're fucking wrong. You can and you will. Russ, dude, listen. This isn't a discussion, Marcus. You've cost me everything. Fucking everything, you get that? Do you realize I just gave my life savings for you? You know what that means? Does it register? Bye bye house. Can't really afford a 10,000 dollar a month mortgage when I don't have a dime in the bank. Russ, do you fucking think it's what I wanna do, huh? I'm fucking hurting inside, man, do you understand that shit? That doesn't matter, 'cause you know why? You're incorrigible. You can't help yourself. You're like a little fucking child, you can't do a thing. So you know what's going on here? You're getting your ass in my car tomorrow and I'm taking you to addiction center. Because maybe one day if you go through that, you might be able to make up this grandiose fuckup you've done to me. You need help. Me, look at you, you fucking hypocrite. You can't go two fucking minutes without snorting that shit up your nose, man. Do you know what that shit does to you, huh? How dare you criticize me... How dare I? How dare I, motherfucker? I just saved your life! I gave up everything for you. Once again, I'm not doing it anymore, I am done. I'm done with this. So you know what, you either come with me tomorrow 'cause you can't control your life so I'm taking over it for you. And if you're not willing to, if you're not willing to do that, just do the world a favor and fucking kill yourself. Baby, open up. Baby, please let me in. I don't think it's a good idea, baby. I just wanna help you. I'm so sorry. It's okay. It's okay. You look good. Thank you. So do you, babe. I just, I mean I'm happy to see you. So, what's your secret been? My secret? This. Clean living, or? Yeah. Haven't done anything in quite some time now. Good. That's good for you. Still embracing. I found God. Did you? Where was he? Hm, God. I've not felt his warmth in some time now. That's not true. Isn't it? Look at me. See any signs of a divine presence going on here? It's when at your lowest that he's more present than ever. How does that make any sense? Is that what you think, part of God's masterplan, his will to make me suffer, to be a better person, a stronger one? Well that's the point of having faith. It doesn't have to make sense. But somehow deep down you still believe, you know in your heart of hearts that it's true. Are you listening to yourself? Heart of hearts? My mother died. My best friend killed himself. I fell in love with a fucking hooker. You think there's a light at the end of this tunnel? What I meant... Listen, there's not, okay? Look what I've become. Just take it in. I'm a fucking drug addict. This isn't how it has to be for you. You could... Go home? I don't fucking have a home, April. My parents are dead. My home's gone. This, this is my palace now so, why don't you get going, huh? What? Go home, April. Go back to your aunt, your uncle, have a nice life. Go home. You think I can just hop a plane, say I'm sorry and everything'll be fine. Yeah. Well you're fucking wrong, Russ. I don't have a home. My parents never died. I wasn't raised by my aunt and my uncle. I don't have a place to go. I didn't just leave my parents to chase some dream in La La Land. I ran away full speed. Why would you lie about your parents? Because my father was a sick fuck, and my mom was too big of a coward to stand up to him. Do you have any idea what it's like to wake up in the middle of the night with your father standing over you? The man is supposed to make me feel safe and protect me. Do you have any idea what that could do to a 14 year old girl? And when he was too drunk to do that, he just settled for beating me till I couldn't even sit let alone go out in public. How often did he drink? Every night. Jesus. Yeah, Jesus is right. Only then, I couldn't believe in such a thing. You know, how could I? But instead of waiting around for the day he went too far, I took things into my own hands and packed up everything I could in a bag and headed off into the unknown to chase a dream I knew nothing about. I just knew anything was better than that and no one was gonna do it for me. I had no idea. Of course you didn't, Russ 'cause you're so good at judging a book by its cover. But do you understand, Russ? I had the strength to start over, to take off on my own without having or knowing anything about where I was going or what was next. And I'm doing it again. So what's your fucking excuse? You gonna get off your ass and do something to save yourself? Or are you saying you're not even as strong as a fucking hooker? I can't do this on my own. And you don't have to. Sometimes life hits you like a runaway train, make you feel evil, broken, helpless. Like there's no way that things can ever be right in your world again. And sometimes, you can find the strength to start over. The kick in the ass you need to pull yourself out of that gutter and face the day. And most of the time, it comes from the most unlikely of places.
