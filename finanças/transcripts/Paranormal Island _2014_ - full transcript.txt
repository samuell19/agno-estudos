♪ ♪ MAN: Isolated in the middle of Grass Lake, Illinois, is a man-made island bar known as Blarney Island. It's been there for over a hundred years. It started out as a trading post for booze running, gamblers, and gangsters who would travel up from Chicago. Once they arrived to the lake, they would catch a ride on one of the shuttle boats to the island. This made for a perfect hideout because the only way in was by boat. Lookouts could see local authorities coming from a mile away. As legend has it, the island is haunted. It reportedly happened after a card game when two local bar owners found themselves competing for the same customers. What transpired that fateful night has affected thousands ever since. Here is one possible explanation of how the bar also became known as Paranormal Island. ♪ Why don't you settle down, Sammy, have a drink. It's 'cause my neighbor's a pain in my ass.
