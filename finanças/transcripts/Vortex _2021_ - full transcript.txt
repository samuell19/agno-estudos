Adaptation: Gail de Courcy-Ireland To all those whose brains will decompose before their hearts Everything's ready. Ok. Some wine? Yes. Stop! Thanks. Cheers. Life's a dream, isn't it? Yes. A dream within a dream. To us. To us. We are so very little. My friend the rose told me so this morning. I was born at dawn baptised with dew. I bloomed happy and in love, in the sun's rays. I closed myself at night and woke up old. Yet I was so beautiful, the most beautiful flower in your garden. We are so very little. My friend the rose told me so this morning. The God who made me bows my head and I feel I am falling, falling My heart is almost bare. I've one foot in the grave. I'm already gone. You admired me yesterday and I will be dust tomorrow for good. We are so very little. My friend the rose died this morning. The moon tonight watched over my friend. In my dreams I saw, dazzling and bare, her soul dancing beyond the clouds and smiling down on me. Believe he who can believe, I need to hope or I am nothing. Or else I am so very little, as my friend the rose told me yesterday. ...we will discuss the grieving process, the importance of rituals, the notion of resilience, post-mourning awareness and subjective experiences of contact with the deceased. Our guests are joined by Dr Boris Cyrulnik, neuropsychiatrist, essayist and ethologist. Dr Chris top he Fauré, psychiatrist and psychotherapist, and journalist Stéphane Allix, author, founder of the Institute on Extraordinary Experiences. Chris top he Fauré discusses the grieving process. The grieving process is the natural, intelligent process intrinsic to our being, that accompanies the healing of the violent, brutal wound caused by death. It will heal the wound and let us go from an external, objective bond with the person we could hear, see, talk to and hug, to a subjective internal bond, where we never lose them. The opposite of oblivion. On the contrary, it's called introjectlon. Internalisation of the loved one's presence, forever. If you're close to someone who's lost a loved one. And you feel helpless or awkward, Dr Fauré stresses the importance of opening up a dialogue, not leaving things unspoken. Asking about their bonds with the deceased, how they died, evoking memories or saying their name helps the griever maintain interaction, favouring the integration process. The grieving process is accompanied by rituals. Boris Cyrulnik: we cannot leave to rot on the ground the body of someone we still love, who lives on in our heart, our mind. We love someone who has gone. We need to invent a grave. We've done it since Neanderthal times: the body is laid in a meaningful position, flower petals are thrown, food is deposited for the journey to the afterlife. Tears are shed. Mr and Mrs Neanderthal knew how to speak, I imagine they must have spoken like today. When we lose someone, a loved one, we carve their name in stone. Carving the name keeps them alive. We put their photo on a tombstone, lay flowers around it, keeping them alive in our memory, when we know they are really dead. So, the grieving ritual... Every culture has a grieving ritual. It gives the deceased dignity, and us too, for if we left the loved one's body to rot on the ground we would be ashamed. We have to make a tomb and we have to perform a social ritual. We cry, but we are together, it gives the death meaning. Our first response was the tomb as an artwork. Egyptians made artworks, we are still unearthing them. It's interesting for the universal human condition: the representation of death. It differs from the perception of a dead person. A dead body is a corpse, death is a spirituality. In Western society, it has been kept at a distance, as have the rituals, traditions and social codes that go with the loss of a loved one. To what end? It's linked to technological progress, which has been beneficial. But in the 50s and 60s, accompanying death moved away from the home. The ancestral practices ...but which put death at a distance from society. It's become medical. Care lies with technicians, experts, and we have removed it from society. It's hidden in hospitals Don't! Thanks. Can I help you? Toys...? Down on the right. ...and then, their brains function again. If they are not reassured the brain is side rated, the brain scan shows it no longer works. So, they need to be reassured and that done, they need to be encouraged to make sense of what has happened. They need to talk, speech becomes affective: emotions are triggered by speaking. It makes sense: why has this happened? How to move forward? It's biological and psychological. You differentiate traumatic memory and healthy memory. How does that work? Healthy memory is progressive. We keep reorganising the memory of what happened. It's not the past returning. It's the representation of the past, our notion of what happened. It shifts with time and people. We don't see things as we did before. Inevitably, as we age, our childhood memories are not as vivid as when we were teens. The representation of our past shifts. Did you find it? Memory of past events change. That is healthy memory, it evolves. Traumatic memory is trapped, it stops moving. Vuk? Coming! You there? There you are! Have you seen my wife? Not at all. Was she here? Was she here? Not today. If you see her tell her I'm looking for her. Ok. It's good you came, I found you a book or two ...for your work. Hang on. What is it? They're on symbolism and dreams. It all ties in with your work. Yeah, my book. It's going well? Yes, but... I have to find my wife. Shall I keep them? Yes I won't be at the meeting, too much work. But I'll call you If I see her, I'll say you're looking for her. Thank you. Take care! Thanks. Have you seen my wife? Down the back. Sir! She's here Where were you? I looked everywhere. All over. Why? Let's go home. You like it? How much? 5 euros. Here, for you. Thanks. Come home. Bye. Be careful. Come Careful. Yes What did you do? Nothing! You went out, left the door open and no-one knew where you went Where have you been? I was at the pharmacy No. That's a lie. Impossible, I went there. I talked to everyone... who works there. They all know you. And no-one saw you. You didn't go there! Stop scaring me. You're scaring me! How? That you'll get lost, in the city... attacked by a thug, a dealer, it's a dangerous city. No Yes, it is. And you swan around it It scares me! People are kind. No! You think so but they're not. They're horrible! The world is full of madmen and horrible people. Full of them! Understand? I don't believe it. It's the truth. No, it's not. I've made my point... So, you'll stop? You'll kill me. No. I don't want to hurt you I'll be ok I have to work, write my book it's important. Very. It's about films and dreams. It's an important book. Please, really Please... Really... ok? Thank you. Please call me back. Really Thanks. Claire, answer... answer me... Please I need to talk to you. I need... to hear your voice. Please. Claire Hi, Jean-Baptiste? It's me, yes. You ok? I need you. You know, I'm writing a book on film and dreams. I've already come up with a title: "Psyche" You like it I'm glad. And also, I found a line, a great line by Edgar Allan Poe: "Is all that we see or seem... Is all that we see but a dream within a dream?" It's grandiose. I wanted to put that line at the start. Yes, true. No doubt I also think that cinema, I mean a movie theatre, is the greatest, most appropriate atmosphere to... to expose our dreams, to tell them, because it's... it's all dark, you have no contact with anyone. It's like being in bed, sleeping, dreaming. Cinema is that. A big dream. All cinema. Not just films about dreams. All films are dreams. Yes. Yes, the line I wrote "The dreamer is awake", yes Sure, I'll ask my publisher if he likes it. I think in a movie theatre, when the spectators dream, they don't see the dream, they see some symbols. Sometimes. But most are in a state of... continual relaxation like they were in a dream. Caught in a situation, a wonderful situation, with things that are in the sky. Symbols, as Freud said. Like the sea... it's your mother, but also means sex. Big sex... when you dream of the ocean! Huge sex! Huge sensuality. That's true. Sometimes I can't say I've never dreamed I dream! But not always the way Fellini did, or Mizoguchi... That's true, very true. It's really... the core issue. Bravo. Ok. Talk soon. Ciao. Stéphane, can you come? Stéphane? Mum, have you called Nathalie? Nathalie? Yes, Nathalie. Your assistant, your former assistant. You didn't call? No, she didn't. Did you? No, I didn't because... she has to do that. She left me two messages. For the brain scan. Another one. No. Yes. It's important. Dad's worried and me too. You're a psychiatrist, you should be reasonable. We'll call her later. Just one appointment, I'll come with you. Ok? Ok. Go see Kiki. These are her pills like a cocktail mix. Your pills and Mum's? Yes. My pills are not many. Most are hers. Kiki was playing with them. Put them away. Look at this. That's really strong. Did Mum write the prescription? No, the psychiatrist did She saw one? Really? He gave her this? Wait... What? What is it? What is it, Mum? What's up? What? Take me home... Take me home... You are home. No, I want to go home. What? Look at me, what's wrong? I want to go home. We are home. Yes. No Look at me. There's that man following me everywhere. Why is he here? Who, Dad? That's Dad. Dad... go see Kiki. Come with me? Will you? Give me your hand. Don't let go. Come, don't let go. What's that? You ok? What are you looking at? What? I'm scared. Scared? Yes? I don't know. We're... We're here. We're here. This is the dining room. I don't Look at me. Who am I? I don't know. I don't know. I'm Stéphane. Who am I? Stéphane. Mum! It's me. You can't kiss my lips! Ok Dad? I've got the DVD you wanted. Shall we watch? Mum? Sit here. We observe the world to understand it and evolve in it. Intelligence helped us make tools to understand the infinitely small and the infinitely large. Coming, Kiki! For over a century, psychologists, biologists, geneticists and neuroscientists have dissected, analysed and measured our world. We have invented computers and walked on the moon but contrary to what we think, our intelligence is not growing. Today science explores the many facets of our intelligence but do scientists really know No, let's not add problems. But you know, there's a big word in life... "Love". I loved you I left you four messages, with no answer. You stay here? I'll go see Dad and be right back. True True Yes, there was... someone. My wife is in bed, asleep. My son He's here. Ok, I hope so. Thank you, my love. Yes, right, I... I'll be strong. Remember her? Who's that? Paulette? Nearly Pauline. Whose mum is she? I don't know. Who's Pauline? Whose mum is she She's What's your name? Kiki. Kiki. That's when... we were in Berlin. You took the photos. You take good photos. Don't you? You know that? Does Dad cook? How do you manage? You cook? Can you say a sentence? Just one. Now and then. Who shops, is it Dad? You'll hurt yourself. Does it hurt? Your hand. You hurt your hand! I saw... I saw that! A bit of quiet! Gently. Play gently. You're crying. Why? What happened? She's not well. Did Kiki... scare you? Did Kiki scare you? Dad, don't say that Kiki didn't make her cry. No, but he did a bit. He does things like that! He's playing. He's playing, but in a way... Yes, but... Don't get angry! Dad, calm down! He's playing, but in a way... We're at table, not in the street. Play quietly. Grandpa and Grandma are tired. Play quietly. My love... My love... Don't cry. I can't stand it. No. Feeling ok? You're ok? Yes, smile... Yes, smile... A little smile... Good, that's lovely. It's nice... It's beautiful. You are so sweet... So beautiful... What can I do? Tell me. Say it. What can I do? Say it. Be... I'll do it. Tell me. Be here. Be here? He is. Dad's here. All three of us are. All the family. With noisy Kiki. It's lovely. It's the most beautiful thing. Your son. Our son. So handsome! She's very ill. You've seen you know. I didn't know. When I was here three weeks ago True. Every day, she's worse. It's a disease with no cure. No drugs, no pills. There are solutions. Solutions? They're like water. Yes, they are. Sit up. The psychiatrist said so. They're like water. Have you seen one? Yes, often. She's declining. Like this, downhill... Constantly... You didn't tell me it was getting worse. Why? Why worry you? You have your life... your son, you have lots going on, your work. But Dad... You can't handle this alone. Mum is writing her own prescriptions. But the pharmacist knows her. When she goes in, he doesn't give her what she wants. Drugs that don't work. Or are bad for the brain. But you're I follow her, but it's not easy. But I asked, I You must be strong. I can't! You must be strong. Like I am, sometimes, sometimes not. I called 10 days ago to see if you spoke to Nathalie. You said you did, but you didn't. No, I didn't I know. You say you're managing but you're not. No. Pauline... How is she? I told you she was in hospital. Again. Do you see her? Do you see her? When we do things for Kiki or with the social worker. Her last fit two months ago was really violent. It was tough on Kiki. It's my fault. No, it's not. Illness is not our fault. Mum's illness isn't my fault. But the drugs, Dad Your wife's illness isn't your fault. These things happen. It's fate. No. Yes, it's fate moving through the city. It moves then strikes. It acts and illness comes. And you, how's the money? There is none. It's gone. Really? I never have any. You know that. You didn't find a good job? Sure I do a documentary or some editing stuff like that. It's fine. I get my benefits, I do enough hours. But I spend the money. It's the same for both of us. We're broke. Yes. Cheers! To the future! Don't push it with Claire It's extra hassle. I call, but she never answers. It's tricky for her. Of course. It's been 20 years us two. In love. We travelled everywhere. It... meant a lot to me. But now it's almost over. Not yet, but almost. That's our life, all messed up. Still smoking? Yes. Maybe I'll kill myself. Remember the issues I've had? Do you take your pills? Totally. Totally, every day. Four pills, always. Without them... It's too dangerous. I'd die. And you? You take the drugs the doctor prescribed you? I have substitutes, but I don't like them. They just there's no pain, but it's crap. Son, our house is full of drugs. And druggies. Indeed. And Mum? She's the most The least of us. Yes. Be careful with what she takes. Don't get mixed up. She's taking super strong drugs. I know. I know the pills are very strong. I'm very careful. It's a life It's a life among drugs. We're really almost... slaves to drugs. You know... he doesn't sleep at night. He's crazy. Why? He leaves papers everywhere! A total mess. I try to tidy but I can't. You don't have to tidy. I go crazy. So, what I'm going to do... is prescribe him Neuroplax. No. Yes! Don't do that. I can do it. It's good when you're here. You'll see with Nathalie for prescriptions. You can't do them any more. Yes, I can. They know me at the pharmacy. I have my doctor's card. Can I take this for Kiki? Take what you want. If he's hungry later. And a yoghurt. Take more. Do you have to go? Yes. She's fetching him tomorrow. Why not sleep here? Not tonight. I'll get Kiki. Kiki... Yes, Daddy? Put your cars away. We're leaving. Now? Coming? Ok? Kiki and I are going. You're off? Yes. Can you lend me 200? My card was eaten. Stupid me. Thanks. Be careful with the drugs Mum gives you Drugs? You think she'll poison me? No! No? She doesn't want to poison you. She... she thinks she's still a doctor and can prescribe. She's mixed up. So, keep your pills separate. Be careful. Thanks. Love you. Me too. I smell gas. Gas! What have you done? Gas! What have you done? You're mad! It's ok Mad! I've tidied your desk. What? Tidied your desk... My papers! On the desk! You put them in the toilet! That's It's a disaster! A total disaster! You want to kill me. Always! This house has become... A real nightmare! You destroyed my papers, my book. All my papers. All I wrote I can't say you are mad. You're worse! Dad, I don't know how to help. You are getting into a stage... where Mum is losing it. You had heart problems. It was bad. And it's getting worse for both of you. Since I'm worried for Mum, she told me about a home where you can have your things. They're flats, with nurses and carers, psychologists, psychiatrists There's a room for two available in... a month or two. It's rare to find a room for two. But I don't want that. I don't want to leave this house... where we've lived all our life. It holds our past, our things reminders of our lives. Mine, hers Our work, our books. All this is part of our life. We can't leave this house. You can take things. Hundreds of books? Journals, magazines Impossible! We'd throw most away. I don't throw away my past. I work You can work there. No, I couldn't. You're deluded. Impossible. I won't go with my wife to a flat that's a hospital... for people wrong in the head. Mum is wrong in the head. She's bad due to an incurable disease which is well known. Young psychiatrists specialise in it. Have you called them? Yes, I have. Yes, I have a list. Nathalie says not. But I have a list of young psychiatrists specialised in this disease. We've spoken. There's no cure. You can't manage alone. Don't say you call them, you don't. I called! To get a list! A long list in your office. You called, but Mum hasn't seen anyone. Have you seen a psychiatrist? Mum, have you seen a psychiatrist? I talked to one. I don't care if you called. Stop I met one at the lab. I've talked about it. Everyone knows this disease. It's well known. To everyone. Dad It's be better if I was... dead. Don't say that. Don't. It's not true. You're with us. Alive, talking moving forwards. You have a past to share. No. Sorry I'm really sorry. Don't be, Mum. We're looking for solutions, good ones. Dad, I can't help you properly. I can't. If Mum falls over You never come over almost never. Yes, I do, whenever I can. I don't want to be mean but if anyone has to go to a clinic, a hospital... or a home, it's you! You have problems to solve. But Dad, I tried! Stop! It's ok. It's the first time we've talked, it's important. It's the first time we open our souls. The first time. I'm sorry Don't be. Dad, when I I'm not against you That's not the point! I'm not. You don't want to be mean, but it's silly to say I should be in a clinic. That's not the point. It's not! I'm trying I help at the association, I have a social worker. I don't come much because I'm trying to get organised. When I went Mum... Sorry. For what? For what? You're not guilty. Of anything. When you put me in the mental hospital. You were doing your best. For you! You didn't say it was a cage or a prison. You meant well. For a while just a time. Listen to me. That's irrelevant. It was a mental hospital. You meant well and it was good. From then on even though I didn't Things happened. I had bearings, support. I could do things healthily. You meant well. I can't take care of you properly. If Mum falls, you can't pick her up. If she's lost, you don't know where to go. If you fall You had a stroke 3 years ago. If you fall, what does Mum do? Sometimes she doesn't know who she is, or you, or even the neighbour! True? I'm dealing with it. I've asked my friends, journalists, writers, important people, for a man, not a woman, too weak a strong man who can help pick her up if need be, go out with her in the street. You've met them? No, I have names on a list. Just names and lists! A man in particular, who lived with a family, everyone knows him, they say he's a good man. So what? And I also found a new psychiatrist. I have a list! Dad, I'm... I'm not accusing you. I'm not. I know you're trying You make lists, you call, but no-one is here to help you. You told me I often lied to you. Right? I'd lie so you wouldn't worry. Now you're lying, Dad. Don't say you're not. I know you make lists. But I can't help you. I can't even help myself! Kiki we have a custody worker who says you can or can't do this. I can't help you. The little I do, you don't follow up. You say you make lists, I trust you, I know you do! I want someone more capable than me or you two to help. Let's make her feel... good. Good... Your son and your husband love you. For sure. They'll help you. Dad, I don't want to lecture, ok? Everyone I just... Mum is lucid today, she's stable I want us to talk. You who like lists, let's list good ideas. Just good ones. Don't reject them all. Maybe a home is not a good idea. Maybe there are ideas there, with carers, we could ask. If not that home, another one? I want us to agree on a process. I want you to be rid of me. What do you mean? Of course, it's tiring and tense, but we're talking! If we don't, it's crap. You'd have talked to your patients, wouldn't you? You'd have talked to your patients. You'd say: "something's wrong." "We can do this, change that" Yes or no? Yes. Us too, awkwardly perhaps, because Dad is Italian and shouts. And I'm stubborn. Dad? We're clumsy, that's all. Talking is important. It would be We're a small family really small... Not big! Three people. And Kiki. No-one else. I'm a bit tired You're tired? A bit. Do you want a coffee, a tea? Yes. Dad, a coffee? No, thanks. Water. Let's... pretend it's normal. Do you have a... cigarette? Got any kits? We need 2 or 3 shoot kits. 2 or 3? Go for 3. Thanks. And a crack pipe. Need a stick? Sure, why not. Paper towels, water? No. We're cool. Ok, take care. Lots of needles today! Few people now. How's your Mum? So-so... Old age sucks No kidding. Ageing or smack, which to choose? We don't choose. She takes more drugs... than us or them. You holding out? Not great. Hang on, dudes... Hello. We're closing. Give me some kit. Please. One each. We're closing Sticks? For my friend! You know the score. He's coming! So when? He'll come alone. We're here tomorrow. Ok. Tell him to come. Ok. We're here every day. Bye. Take care, guys. Closing time. The Memory of Film. That's our next issue. And we could use it to get some money. We are the memory of film! And you, you're writing a book! I'm writing a book. A book on... on film and dreams. Great! Dreams, memory What fires dreams? It's not the same. No, it's not. It's different. It's totally linked. It's completely different. Coffee? Me. Excuse me. How's your wife? Not good. At all. What is it? What is it? You're avoiding me. That's what. We can't discuss it here. Is something up? No. Really? We need a break. I still love you. Always. I'm still in love with you Truly Deeply. I know, me too. It breaks my heart. I miss you. Your kindness, your love. Your tenderness. We must go back. Steph! Can I come to yours? No. Can I smoke at yours? Please Let me in, please. If you want something Smack? I can get you smack. I know a guy, he's got mean shit! The best to shoot up. It's clean. Not far away! I'll score it for you. No money. Well whenever you want. I'm here. Let me smoke inside. If you change your mind I'm here. Go on! Ok, come in. Oh God. What are you doing? I'm in pain. My heart I'll just Good. That's better. Yes. What can I? Ambulance... Call an ambulance. I'm calling. Stéphane. Zero. Six. Six. Five. Seven. Four. Seven. Six. Four. Five. It's ok. Stéphane it's Mum. Dad had a fall... in his office. Call... for an ambulance.

Is he alright? Are you? Darling? Darling? What's the matter? Your husband's gone. He won't be back. Go get some sleep. And call your son tomorrow, ok? Of course. Where is this place? I know it. Ok. I'll tell her. Right away. Have a nice day. Madam? Ok? I just spoke to your son. Stéphane. He's very pleased. He's found you a home. Great! Not far. At the Porte de Pantin. That's good! It's a good place. We'll get you ready to go. Fill your wash bag. Choose your clothes. He's so glad. You... You are who? I've been coming for a few days to help you, give you food, your pills. We talk. Together. You talk of your childhood, your grandma. We know each other, I talk about my life. And now your son is so glad because I'm not always here. It's best for you. You'll be safe, with people who listen, who talk, who care for you every day. It'll be great. Our Father, Who art in Heaven... Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Our Father, Who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy name. Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen. The papers will be ready this afternoon. Do you have all the elements? I'll take them. Thank you. Thank you. For women, most choose white flowers. You have a choice of urns, take your time looking through. We are here for you, of course. Mum, my beloved mum. The last months with you and Dad were intense. And it was weird for me, who was always your prime anxiety, to play parent and dare to make decisions for you... sometimes against your freedom of action. All dreams are short, dreams within dreams even more so. I hope your sleep is finally peaceful. We will do as you wished, Mum, so no-one disturbs your journey. On behalf of Kiki, myself, your friends and relatives, we say thank you, Mum. Thank you for sharing, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now watch a slide show to recall happy times spent with the deceased. Grandma and Grandpa have a new home? No. That's not a home. Homes are for the living. THE END
