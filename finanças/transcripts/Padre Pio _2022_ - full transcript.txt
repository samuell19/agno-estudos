Oppression, you know what it is? Oppression means cruel and unjust treatment. It's what happened to you. You work hard every day, right? You work all day or not? Do you ever stop? This is not right, this is not fair. Exploitation means that you're not the one who takes the benefit from your work. "In nature, everything is transformed. Nothing is created and nothing is destroyed. Following this natural law that wants transformation is the struggle for existence and the revolution." Nature is a cycle of constant change.

The world is not transformed by following the plans that a prophet writes on paper or preaches to the masses. Their socialism is not ours. Social revolution... is not the creation of one man's will.

Her mother asked me to repair them. She won't be needing them anymore. And what was her fault? To be born poor? In the gospel it is written that it will be very difficult for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of Heaven, while Marx said so too, in his own way. [Angelo] You're talking about the Kingdom of Heaven, but here we live in hell. I walk alone among them, in front of their ailments, their cries, their problems, most unsolvable. Here we need water, we need a hospital. The little kid died because I could not get the medicine I needed to save her. We need to change things. But we, the socialists, are divided. We are against each other. [chuckles softly] Luigi wants to talk about the brotherhood of the workers, but here we only have the unemployed. And most of them can neither read or write. I know it is hard. We are divided, but you do not despair, because whoever is not with you is not necessarily against you. Call them friends, if not brothers. And remember the words of the poor carpenter when he said, "There is no greater love than this, to give one's life for one's friends." Friends, huh... Even shoes are divided according to their social class. [sighs] [humming] [Padre Pio] I feel that sometimes when I'm in the midst of prayer that I'm just... that I feel alone like I'm... I feel not alone like lonely, but alone like the Lord has abandoned me, and I'm essentially talking to myself. Do you feel in darkness? Yes, tremendous. Do you feel abandoned? Yes. And scared and baffled and confused and... and like I'm sinning but I don't-- I don't know if I'm sinning or not, because it feels like a sin to the question these things, it feels like a sin to be angry with the Lord. [sniffles] And I'm angry a lot. I feel angry a lot. - You know? - I can tell you, the Lord hasn't abandoned you. He's with you even in the midst of darkness. [sniffles] You have to keep your purer life, and receiving the sacraments. It's the way, it's the only way to be able to stay in the right road. Without the Lord, you can't do anything. I know.

But if God wanted this, even Him, why does He want to keep us alive? - To torment us? - No, no. War is a terrible thing, Francesco. And your pain is real, yes. Do not let Satan take advantage of your suffering. Do you understand? Blessed is the man who endures the trial, Francesco. When I was young, my mother would do embroidery at home, yes, sitting in a chair. And, uh, I, sitting in a stool, looked up at the work... but I would only see it from upside down. I'd see the knots and the confused threads, and I'd say to my mother, "What are you doing? What is this? Why is it so ugly?" And my mother, she would lower the frame, and she would show me the good side of the work, and I would see all of the colors were in the right place and the pattern was beautiful, precise. I, like you now, can only see the work from upside down 'cause I was sitting in a short stool, Francesco. If you lift your spirit up in prayer, the Lord will show you the design He has for you. Calm.
