No meat today. Sorry, miss. No coke, miss. Sprite. Sprite. Senorita? Senorita? Senorita, you tell to me if you're intending to remain very long. Senorita? Senorita? Senorita? If possible I will wait for you. Senorita? Si, si, si, si. So good to see you again. Young rebels used to be so sexy. Aren't you looking at me? - Are you coming? - Yeah. Are you coming? -Si. -Are you coming? - Uh-huh. Si. - So, come! What a fucking joke. You are getting more skinny, eh. If you get any more skinny, I don't want you no more. -Do you have any talcum powder? -Que? No, talcum powder. I must tell you something. Yes. The moment has come when I must take your press card and your letter of authority. What are you saying? You're not a journalist. Yes, I am. No, you're not. I am, too, a journalist. No, you're not. Hey, hey. What... Give me that! And the press card? -Where is the press card? -I don't have my press card. -Yes, you have. -No, I don't. It's back at the motel. -No, it's not. -Yes, it is. It is invalidated. Who invalidated it? I am forced to. One of these days, the army will arrest you. And this letter carries my name. This is my name. Veraguas. -You understand? -I understand. Everyone who reads it sees my name. Fucking all pimps. You're all fucking pimps! Fucking jackass. Yes! Yes! I left many messages for you, but you never responded. Why that is? I am forced... I am forced to wonder. -You were forced to wonder? -Mm-hmm. I am forced to tell you that you said you would replace my phone which you broke. I'll be needing some shampoo. I will buy for you the shampoo with much pleasure. Very generous, Subtenente Verga. I'm waiting for my chauffeur. If it is quite okay... If it is quite okay not to call me under this name, Verga. My name, it's Veraguas. And it is "subtenente". Subtenente. Where do you wish to go? You wish the InterContinental. Yes. I wish. Car reeks big time even with the mask on. Senor? Ola! Gracias. Martini, por favor. Como estas? Gracias. May I have a cigarette? Uh, evening. I have none on me, I'm sorry. You're English. I am. London, currently. Where are you from? Uh, here and there and yonder. What about yourself? Didn't we just do that? Miguel? Alphonso? Roberto? Si. She's a little wet. There's too much vermouth. Smell the bamboo in here? It's not the nicest smell, is it? You have the kind of good manners that eventually get you killed. Gracias. We have 45 minutes till the bar closes. Long enough to get swacked. Wanna try a gin with me? What brought you here? I came on a plane. I suppose I met all your motives. I can tell you my motives. I wanted to know the exact dimensions of hell. Are you for sale? I'm press. We're all press. Then we're all for sale. I came here as a special correspondent up in the north area. Really? It's one of the rougher spots, is it not? In a sense. What made you leave? It was nothing. Girl scout camp for refugees. Right, right, right. And what about you? Me? I'm, uh... I'm here with the Watts people. I say "with", but I'm here alone. The Watts people, the oil company? Yeah, on, uh, a charitable cause, you could say. - Please don't go into detail. No, I just mean, how many companies do you think, at the moment, would consider investing in a place like this? Not many I'd imagine. No, next to none. That's all in the name of profit, but, uh... I don't know, I still that the idea of throwing some business their way has humanitarian overtones. Now that we know each other so well... ...care for some supper? I think it's kind of late. For a price, I'll sleep with you. Your skin is so white. It's like being fucked by a cloud. You're just a mist. Yes. A mist. Don't panic, baby. It's your room. I wanna be paid in dollars. Everybody wants dollars. There's talk they're gonna roll up the Cordoba. Roll up? Yeah. Fuck me. Would I have to pay extra for that? I have no dollar supply. I live entirely on black-market Cordobas. Don't worry. You don't have to start thinking how to ditch me. I'm not here for your dollars, I'm here for the air-conditioning. You're thinking so hard how to ditch me that your head is smoking. What do you have to say about that? I was thinking about something quite a bit different. I commit adultery often. I never really miss anybody. I feel I'm in danger of throwing my life away. Shall we meet again? Again and again. Anytime you have 50 US. Right. Of course. I don't usually fall asleep in somebody else's bed. I like your style. Normally, in my dark heart, I look down on the impoverished lackeys of pig billionaires with their poor report string back. Take a shower if you want. I have running water in my hotel, baby. "Impoverished lackeys." See how fast the tropics sap you? - Buenos dias. - Buenos dias. No. - Hello. - Hello. - Hello? - Can you hear me now? I've got you. I've got you fine. -Okay. -Hi. First of all, it's very early here. I mean, I'll just say what I said again. Why would a monthly magazine that specializes in sustainable high-class travel, be interested in any events, any person, any fucking thing from the continent of Nicaragua? Continent? Uh, your geography is a little off there, buddy. But I'm saying that I can get you a wonderful piece on a nature reserve in, in Costa Rica. You'll wake up to the sound of howler monkeys, you'll have a deluxe tent and a private bathroom, which is a real steal in the midst this pandemic. Yeah. Well, I'd love to be woken up by howler monkeys at 7:00 a.m., but not by you, Trish. No offense. Is this gonna be another one of these, like, "Send me X amount of cash "and you'll never, ever hear from me again"? Because we already did that. You're hearing from me right now. And if you could just get me to Costa Rica, I promise you I'll get my act together. Things aren't as simple here as you wanna think. Okay. How about this? Is this simple enough? Fuck you. I am employed by you. You have never, ever, been employed by me. Not never, not never, ever. You did some piece work for us, Trish. That's it. You were like a temp, okay? - What are you trying to say? I'm trying to say something along the lines of what I just said, which is, we don't need your stories about missing persons or murder. I can watch that on CNN, okay? Just... Why don't you just admit to yourself you're not a journalist? All right? And stop calling me. -Can I please, uh... -Trish? Trish? Do you have my number? Yep. Good. Lose it, okay? Bye-bye, senorita. Bye-bye. Oh, use the other fucking door because this one doesn't open? Pay in dollars or use the other fucking door? Just wait until American tanks come and crush your hopeless country. Either way the American tanks are gonna come and fucking crush your country! -Only chicken today. -Rum. Gracias. Um... I'm an American journalist, and I'm going home tomorrow. Tomorrow or the day after. Muchas gracias. Gracias. No, I think it's great. It's just a matter of how much time it takes. Great. Um, it should be fine... - Thanks. - Welcome, sir. I had a reason for ignoring you. It's okay, whatever my true feelings. Oh. I'm sorry. Consorting with unescorted women is no disgrace, Daniel. No, it wasn't that. I was... I was concerned for your reputation. Who's that friend of yours? He has a project to grow rice with rainwater. What I do interests him. He's a Costa Rican cop. No. Yes. He's from the O-E-Jota. What do you know about the OIJ? O-E-Jota. Those are the Costa Rican cops. No, I know that. This man's not a cop. Yes, he is. And he's waiting for you outside of the hotel right now. What have you got to do with them? Or do I not want to know? Is it cold enough? - I'll take a beer, thank you. Are you familiar with the American expression "you've got your ass in a sling"? I'm familiar with most of your expressions. I'm familiar with a lot of things. If you don't mind me saying so, I'm familiar with the way that whores try desperately to act as if they feel superior to those of us who pay them, when actually, you feel quite inferior. Actually, I think you feel ashamed. Ooh. Why didn't you look at the waiter just now? Why don't you look at me when I'm talking to you? 'Cause there's nothing to see. If there's nothing to see, then why don't you look at me? If I'm no one. Okay. Let's back this up a little bit, okay? Because, actually, I'm not the one the O-E-Jota's waiting for outside the InterContinental, am I? Well, he's not the OIJ. O-E-Jota. All right. Thank you. Can I have one of those Belmonts, please? Does he say he's your friend? He does. Then don't talk to him anymore. Did he say his name? - He showed me his ID. - Okay. You're so fucking out of it. Don't speak with him anymore. Forget him. Do you have a gun? Shoot him. I don't have a gun. I bet that if we leave this hotel right now, he'll follow us. He's waiting for you outside. And he's not gonna let you get away. You're drunk. Would I be sitting here if I were the littlest bit sober? No, no. Let's go to my room. Do you have 50 US? I have 50 US. Good. Give it to me, I need to buy some shampoo. We're gonna go to the Mercado Oriental and you'll see we're being followed. Let's lose the cop. Senor? - Okay. - Gracias. Come on. Nothing like running away in an old Toyota. That's him. That's him right there. They have the Costa Rican plates, they look like the new California ones. - You know? No, I don't know. It's ridiculous. I'm pretty sure, he knows where I'm staying. We'll lose them down at the Mercado. No. What's going on? Is he still there? I can't see a thing. Senor. I understand. Thank you. Whoa, whoa, whoa, you all right? You insist I'm plastered. I'm fine. I have the use of my legs. Okay. Okay, very good. I need to buy some shampoo. You didn't like the one you stole from me? Okay. I gotta get some rum. Gracias. Aww. Throw this away. There won't be any elections, babe. I promise. Happening next week. Rum and shampoo. Gracias. I should get my hair washed by a real professional. Gracias. Gracias. Mm. Don't blink or you'll miss the whole show. They'll postpone the election again, and they'll blame the US. It'll happen. Why? Why would they risk losing all of this power now that they have it? Because there are people here who still have principles. Oh. Like what? What principles? Democracy, equality. Starbucks. I didn't know why I bother. Me neither. Go, go, go! You, my friend, just made 1,000 Cordobas. -Fuck the Rica! Fuck the Rica! -You are a piece of work. Hey. Stop, stop, stop. - What you doing? - One moment. What are you doing? Gracias. That Costa Rican would've had plenty of time to shoot you in your back. - Right. - Bang. I can feel it. Bang. It's my pleasure. This is my hotel. Where's all the money from? That's not your kind of question. Are you a little tense? Should I be tense? Watch out for dog doo doo and kitty plop. You're amazing, you know that? Nothing stops you. Not rain, not car chases, not dog shit. -Any calls? -No. Hmm. It's, uh, nice subdued lighting. One bulb. You have a back door. Mm-hmm. This room was originally hired by the hour. So, come through the door, you pay, nobody sees your face, nobody gets your name. For a life like that. It's a life like another. I think maybe I've made a big mistake. Hey, Englishman. My sweaty, sweaty Englishman. You're gonna be boiled alive. Black. No milk today. Por favor. Isn't that what you call my motel? Today? Tomorrow? Please speak very loud and slow. Yes. Okay. Can I come to the office? -Please say yes. -Yes. Soon? Before noon. Okay, I'll come right now. Certainly, but don't hurry. Not to the office. Wait for me at my club. Eat me! Ola. Si. Si. You know how I like you. Not only I like you, I'm fond of you. You're very beautiful. Si. Please. Please, please buy a plane ticket for me. Please. No. Miss Johnson? Miss Johnson, it's me, Subtenente Veraguas. Miss Johnson? Miss Johnson? Miss Johnson? -Hey. -Hi. To The InterContinental, please. Okay, sir. Do you have some time out of you? Yes, sir. Are you able to wait for a few minutes? If, uh, near the hotel, if I ran up for a quick shower, and you can take me to the Plaza de la Revolucion, to the Ministry? - Yes, sir. Yeah. - Thank you. We can stop here. No, but this way today to go to the... No, no, no, no. It's fine. We can just wait here for one, for a moment. Just one moment. You see that guy? Costa Rican scumbags. What a bullshit. They'll take anyone at that hotel. I have a room at the hotel. And a girlfriend at the motel. See, man, this hotel is high security for foreigners like you, not for us. - American puppets. - Your compatriots. I'm not an American. You've got problems with your phone? No, it's fine. We can't get them fixed in here. It's fine, thank you. But what would you do with it? I will throw it away. No, man. Give it to me. You don't want it, you understand? It's, uh, it's dangerous. No, man, not for me. It's easy to sell in here. Show me. I can make them traceable. -Can I keep it? -Yeah. What do we do now? We do nothing. We, uh, we just wait. Yeah, fuck them. I live at a height above the things. I believe you can help me. How did you find our eggs? I have chicken at my house. I am fond of eggs, but I... I don't need eggs. I need to speak to your coyote. I can get beer, come my friend's house. And the man who will get cash right here in the Plaza Espana, is my cousin. I can buy cash from him at a good price. Can I speak to the coyote now? Ola. Gracias. I want to verify you. I don't want you to verify me. Then I have no money for you. No US. That much money come from the black market. I don't want no trouble. No. No trouble. Hmm. No passport, no dollars. -Fuck you. -Fuck is a good word. Fuck is the property of the whole world. You don't speak Spanish. You don't speak Spanish. It's no good for you. Very bad situation. People from Department of Defense came to see me, and ask for you. They were very tough. This is no good. Okay. Did you tell them where I live? No. No. But they can find out easy, fast. Wait, uh... What did I do? Some of them very bad. Go. Go now. Today. But, I... Let's go outside and then you can explain to me in Spanish what's happening. -I want to understand. -No. We can finish our conversation right now. You're my only friend here. -Hmm. -Please. Yeah? I hear you have a new friend now. Okay, um... Fuck. I appreciate what you've been able to do for me. Hi. Uh, I would like to speak to one of your guests. Mr. Daniel DeHaven, please. He's not here. Uh, can I leave him a message? He has checked out. Um... Checked out? You mean he took his luggage? He's checked out, he's left? Yes. - Any calls? - No, miss. The Englishman in trouble is still here. The senora let you in? I've been hiding here all day. Mm, really? And just what are you planning to do? I need to go back to my hotel. They told me that you left. What do you mean "left"? They said that you checked out. You packed up and you checked out. They told you I checked out? I don't know. I could have got it wrong. It was over the phone, so... Maybe I got it wrong. Um... Did you know the Department of Defense is after you? You never said anything about those people. I didn't really think that anyone was after me. Do you think it now? Will you help me get my things from my hotel? Certainly not. No, I'm serious. I can't. No. If I help you, then I'm going to end up wishing that I never met you once. Unless, of course, you have a MasterCard or an Amex. Because when you buy me a plane ticket, then I'll see what I can do for you. I do have an Amex, but I can't use it. It's a company card. I tried to get money out earlier and it's blocked. You said that you didn't leave the hotel. Hmm. That's fishy. Guy like you without a card to his own name. I do have a card in my own name. It's in my coat. At the hotel. I'm tired. I'm tired. I'm tired and I've got to rest. And every time I turn around, they're jamming something under somebody else's fingernails. This is the worst time of day. This is the worst time of my whole life. What did you do when you were stateside? If you don't mind me asking. A little of this, and then a little bit of that. Mainly a little of this, I suppose? I suppose, that's what you want to hear. No, no, no, no, no, no! Don't go. You're in danger. I need go to the Intercontinental. Need to know if I was checked out. You're in danger. Hey! Wait. Hey! You walk too fast. I need a drink. ♪ So many dreams we share ♪ Before we shared each other ♪ So many dreams we shared ♪ Like the stars at noon ♪ In the heat ♪ Of the streets ♪ In the rain that doesn't cool us ♪ And the earth ♪ Under our feet ♪ Under the stars at noon ♪ And you say ♪ We've been there forever ♪ Half close your eyes ♪ See them for yourself ♪ And I bought my cigarette ♪ And only five or so minutes later ♪ Just a half ♪ Breath away ♪ Under the stars at noon I'm sorry. ♪ And you said ♪ We've been there forever Do you dance like that with your wife? ♪ Half close your eyes Of course. ♪ See them for yourself ♪ All the time. I think a taxi driver died. I recognize that cab driver. He's from around. It's too bad you got checked out. It's too bad they took your gun. What gun? - No, no, no. - It's British Airways. I don't control when their offices are open. I told you this before. Just one more call. Por favor. -No! -It's quick! I can pay you, for God's sake. -I can pay. -No. Hey, can you help me? She doesn't understand what I'm saying. Ah, miss? What's she saying? She wants you to pay for the room. I can pay for the room. I can pay for the room and the phone. So, what's this about British Airways? You're planning some kind of quick exit? Can you call the hotel? They have my ticket information. Ticket information? -Why not use your phone? -Please! Please, just call them. Thank you. Okay. Will you ask for me, Daniel DeHaven, Watts Oil. -Do you expect me to find you there? -I don't know. Just see if I've been completely checked out. And maybe someone's left something for me. -A clean shirt... -Ola. Says you've checked out. Okay. Can I speak to her? Can I speak to her? Hello. This is Daniel. In English, please. In English, please. I can't understand. I can't understand. She's speaking in Spanish. Can you? I can explain about the ticket. Just give me a minute. Excuse me. Excuse me. Please. Is... Is something funny? Hmm? You're still... You're laughing. What is your name, please? Hmm? I have a bad head for names. I lived in the US for four years. Got married to my wife there. My two little girls, they go to boarding school in Virginia. So, don't fuck with me. Okay? That is my statement. Okay. - I'm going back... - Okay. Excuse me. No. No. I told you already once. Don't fuck with me or I'm going to fuck with you. So, you better let me take your passport. -You can't have my passport. -I can't? I'm under the protection of the Nicaraguan government. You are? You're under the protection of the Nicaraguan government. Where are they? I know your English friend is inside. Do you think this is a fucking game? Hm? -I can't talk. -What do you believe? What do you believe? You believe that you can take this guy to the Mercado, fuck him, it's fine, - and then... - ...it's finished? Huh? -Did you fuck him? -Let go of me. -Huh? -Hey! Let go of me. Let go of me. Let go of me! Let go of me. You're just a Costa Rican cop, and you have no control over me. I am listening outside of your window, bitch. Do you know how many people are playing in your fucking game? A lot of people are involved. Hm. You have some on you. Huh? You think you're going to take this guy, fuck him, and then just like that, you say, "It's finished"? No. You're going to have a lot of explanation to take care of, goddammit! You're just another fucking cunt playing games. I thought you'd gone. I'm still here. I thought I got rid of you. Come inside. Did you see who was out there? Yeah. That's why I came here. Says he listens to us fucking. I can't think. My mind won't function. Fuck you. I don't need it anymore. I can get rid of it. Your phone. Yeah. Who is he? Who is that Costa Rican? What's he doing here? -What's happening? -I don't know. I don't know who he is. I don't know if he's operating by himself. I don't... I don't know who he's in touch with. Okay, well, you're the one that's supposed to face him, and I'm the one that's getting my windows peeked into. You came here to do business, yeah? Do you have any contacts? I don't have any contacts. Do you? Yeah. I have a half-senile VC ministro at the inter turismo who can't get hard, and a subtenente that can. And they both just got done cutting me loose because of you. I'll be out, all right? I'll be out by night. You can't just leave me now. That's fucking horrible. I'm caught. All right. I'm caught. I love you. No. Gracias. You're right. I told them my esposo would pay for it. I'm tired. I'm having my period. Be gentle. You never did it like this with you wife? I'm glad you let me. Please keep me. Vamos! Vamos! Vamos! Get out! Move it! Let's go! Move it! You don't want to sit up front? I'm tired. Need to rest. Are you sure you want to leave with me? You're almost out of gas. I guess so. I don't know this city. See, you do need me. Yeah. I need you. Can you pass me a cigarette? This is our honeymoon. I need to sleep. Let's just die here. Are we in a hurry? Let me try and take a shower first. I stink. Didn't you hear me? I said we have no towels. You want me to think that you're so tough and cynical. I know that you like to be touched. There's no need to pretend to cry. Suck me. Excuse me. Uh, yes. You want to... Do you mind, uh, sitting down and watching me eat my breakfast or... Whatever I'm eating is delicious. Beans, eggs, rice. Not from here. Mm. Where's it from? -Costa Rica. -Ah. Costa Rica. Of course. I'm sorry. It's my first time down in Central America. I work for a consulting firm. Please, have a seat. It's my treat. We're the only customers in here anyway, right? -It requires money to eat here, so... -Mmm. ...you can bet nobody in this town has any. It's a little hot over here. Do you mind moving to the other side? It's a little shady over there. Okay. It really gets me how rude everybody is down here. The way you just ordered food was just so impolite. -Impolite? -Mm-hmm. Nobody says "please" or "thank you." I really miss the States. Where are you from? DC. This mash is pretty good, though. What's the full name of the company that you work for? Because with all these initials, you just never know who you're talking to. You've got... You've got "PS". Mm-hmm. MAPML. Don't ask me what that stands for. And... Well... Then there's CIA. Well, we're actually out of Connecticut. And, um, consulting is such a weird business. Weird in the sense that it gets completely blown out of proportion. I'm not kidding. I can't even believe what they pay me. I'm working on a report right now, and if I need anything, anything at all, snap my fingers, just like that. Say I wanted to hire you to help me, hire you to consult for me, I could just, um, snap my fingers, and envelope of $20,000 in your lap, like that. Who are you consulting for down here? Who on Earth would want to do business in this country? Well, it's not this country, specifically. You know, um, Central America as whole is kind of like a gambler's paradise. You know, everybody is giving the odds a shake, whichever game they feel like playing. But, uh, in all seriousness, there's, um, wheat and rice conglomerates that are looking out at the land around here. If you can believe that. You bet I do. You're unbelievably obvious. So, I mentioned oil before, and... Okay. Um, anyways, I mentioned oil and parts of my report actually touch on the petroleum outlook in the area, and your friend actually pops up in it, a couple of times, as a matter of fact. And that is if the guy you're traveling with is the same person that I'm thinking of. But... Anyway, the local businesspeople are very level-headed and serious. What do you mean about my friend? Well, he's one of the characters. Haven't you noticed? He's taking advantage of the local elections and meddling with the balance of power that was so difficult to achieve. -Uh, coffee, please. -Okay. What do you mean about bringing up my friend? My report is about this region, and balance is what this region is all about. And so, what does your job have to do with my friend? Well, that's your friend coming right now, isn't it? What does your report have to do with my friend, I've asked you! Well, like I said, I don't even know if it's the same person. He just happened to wander in and receive scrutiny, kinda like right now. Don't mind me. Of course... Of course not. Um, you see, Central American countries are looking for the best way to achieve balance, both economically and politically. Even if that means some sort of American military involvement, but, um... It's not really what we prefer, is it? But then again, why not? Why not indeed? I'm just a consultant. What do I know? Maybe enough to tell me what to order. Oh. Well, if you're hungry, you should have some of what I had. It's not bad at all. First gallo pinto I've seen. We're getting closer to Costa Rica. Is that where you are, uh, where you guys are heading? CR? What's going on down there? CR, Costa Rica. Nothing special. Well, I've been in San Jose for about a month. I thought you said this was your first time in Central America. Pretty accommodating guy, that Vice Minister in del turismo, don't you think? Gracias. He's the one that got me into this whole mess. Made me change my dollars into Cordobas. Don't worry, babe. He already knows all about us. I figured as much. I can give you a pretty good exchange rate on those. If that's what you want. Somehow, I'm not surprised to hear that. Sorry to change the subject. The, uh... The election interests me. Maybe we could take a walk, find a newspaper. I'm thirsty. Whores, they all are. Excuse me? I mean, they'll all do it for enough money. Any of these women. Venezuelan, Costa-Rican, doesn't matter. Why don't you go grab one coming out of church one day and give it a try, and you'll see what I mean. They're all as lonely as widows. They haven't had a man's hand on their thighs since Jesus was in diapers, or Moses had a pacifier. We should get going, find that paper. Cordobas isn't your only problem, I hear. It seems you have a passport issue as well. How long have you known him? Huh? Okay. I know you haven't known him for that long. I can tell by your body language. Okay? Please. How do you know who he is, who he says he is? How do you know he isn't... Okay. I get it, and understand how exotic everything feels. Everything is ten volts higher. Okay? And if I saw somebody like you, I wouldn't ask for references. So, you didn't ask for references. Big deal. It's a mistake, but it's not a crime. Just another absurd fuckhead. Look, look. Listen, Ms. Johnson. Ms. Johnson, listen, listen. Okay? I'm just here... I don't care what you think of me. I'm just here to offer you the best deal that I could make across two borders. It's real and it's straight. I don't understand what kind of deal you think is being offered to you. I think you're offering to screw me. Well, that is definitely the one thing that I am not offering to do. Excuse me. Is that polite enough for you? What were you gonna do? How are you gonna cross the border? By waving the American flag, huh? Wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait! Okay. Are you mad at me? Hey, are you mad at me? Are you mad at me? I know. You're mad at me. I know you're mad at me. I know you're mad at me. I know you're mad at me. I know you're mad at me, but are you mad at me to the point of murder? You're a North American female, prostitute drifter with a press card that's been revoked, and you drink like a fucking Apache. You're gonna get us both fucking killed! Just please, please level with me. I need to feel like I'm moving. Fuck! You don't have a passport, do you? And this whole bloody mess was so you could turn me in. You're all wet. We're passing into Costa Rica. I'm probably their most-wanted fugitive. That's much better for you. Because from there, we can just cross over into Panama. We'll be fine. It's better for you or better for me? You really are a whore. Vaccination. Ah. I would've thought you'd been out of the country by now. I thought we had some sort of a connection before, um, that maybe you understood. I guess it's possible I was a little bit too subtle but, um, I'll be more direct. Your British friend interests me, and I wanna include background on him. Your report's all about him? You could say that, but, look, we're Americans. We're two Americans, right? We're friends. And, uh, let's put it this way. Your travel companion works for a rival outfit. And we'd like to fuck up their action. It's basically that simple, so... I just need a signature on it, and that signature has to be yours. I'm not signing anything. Don't you know what an asshole you are? Don't you know what a delusional asshole he is? Giving charts and documents and a whole economic future to a rogue state. I believe he did it in the interest of fairness. Of course, he did. Right? Gracias. -Yeah, he did. -Yeah. Yeah. Yeah! And what if the oil's not there? Does that blur the edges a little bit? We have a flat. We have to turn and buy a new one. Go back. They smuggle stuff across the border every night. How much can we pay them? A stolen car? Stolen, yeah. -Give more. -Uh... I have some money. Um... Yeah. And watch? Okay. -Yeah? -Okay. Let me grab something. I'm gonna change. -He's saying it's white? -Just put that on because you can't cross in a white thing at night. It's not too late for you to stay if you want. Move. Move! Let me see. -I'm fine. It's fine. -Okay. Let me see. Let's get down. - Jesus. - Come. We really fucked up. Yeah. I fucked up. Cover me up. Cover me up. Cover me up. Cover me up. Cover me up. Cover me up. I will practice my English with you. Your man from the CIA saved you from death. The CIA? It's obvious, I suppose. You know, you work for despicable people. Maybe we could find a room somewhere. The senorita will find herself a hotel. But you, senor, you come with us and be arrested. No. No. Hey. Hey. Hey! Don't. Daniel? Daniel? Daniel! You're very much like a team. We're an unbeatable team. Uh, two beers and a napkin. Por favor. American? English? Ugh. It's terrible. I don't like people like you. I don't like giving you money. Now, if you just come over here, I need a signature, please. I know it's a little bit of a nuisance, but... That's good. Thank you. I'm not depressed. It's done. What did they do to you? Let me use a telephone. I'm coming, too. You could let us pass. Senorita Johnson. What are you doing here? I came to return your passport. I am forced to say I am sad today. I'm forced to say I will miss you. In a way... In a way, you were good to me.
