Did you know moving is the third most stressful life event. Is "Having a baby" on that list too? Ah, honey, I'm sorry, I gotta work that day. All right, look, maybe I can ask my boss... No. No, no, no. It's just a check-up, it's fine. Are you sure? Yeah, you don't wanna rock the boat with the new job so early. You can meet Dr. Collins later. I just hate that I'm gonna be missing all these things. Well, you're keeping us afloat. Like, we're lucky your mom left us this house. So much of her stuff. Yeah, it's just, it's too big. It's not really us. I know. We get to raise our daughter in a home. You know? She can play outside and go to a good school. Have all the things I didn't have. Look, all the kid needs is for us to love her and each other. The rest is gravy. I just wanna make sure that you're happy here. It's important to me. Eloise will have everything she needs, and that will make me happy. Look how cute she is. She sure is. She's got your eyes. What time is it? Oh, shoot. Uh, my briefcase. I've gotta... Uh, downstairs, office box. What's that about? Nothing, I just had a pain in my chest this morning. It's, it's nothing. How do you know it's nothing? Internet. Don't screw around with your health, okay? Let the doctors decide it's not a big deal. Okay, okay, I'll go. You're gonna be late. Fine. She's all set. They're gonna get your paperwork together. Okay. It's just heartburn, right? There's nothing else? Actually, everything is looking really great. Unfortunately, you're gonna have to lay off the lasagna. Uh, what's the point of living? I know. Hi, Dr. Collins. Hello. It was great meeting you, and I will see you at our next appointment. Thanks. Here you go. Thank you. Oh, oh, wait, I got it. Oh. Thank you. Of course. It was gonna get ugly. Ooh, heartburn, huh? What? I just know that look. Oh. Yeah, I basically had a whole lasagna last night, so... Women in the third trimester, it's like a curse. No lasagna? What's the point of living? I just said that. I'm Jina. Sara. Nice to meet you. I know a great acupressure point if you're interested. Uh... I'm a midwife. Not just some weirdo in the car park. Here. It's, uh... Okay. It's two finger widths just from the crease of your wrist, here. Okay. And you just apply pressure. Take a deep breath. It's great for, uh, anxiety, nausea, tummy upsets. Definitely anxiety. Perfect. I have all of those things. Yeah. Especially the anxiety. Yeah, it's really important to just try and take a breath sometimes. I feel like it's working, is it supposed to work that fast? Great. Wow. Thank you. That was amazing. And now I'm starving again. This might be weird, but do you wanna grab lunch? Actually, I'd love that. Great. I think I know a place I've been wanting to go to. Yeah, that would be awesome. All right, follow me. I'll follow you. Perfect. So cute. Yeah. Oh, hi there. Uh, grab a seat wherever you like, I'll get you some menus. Thanks. Should we sit here? Yeah. So, where are you from? Here, I live here. You don't have an accent. Oh. Sorry, I just moved here a little while back. I'm... kinda starting over, too. I just hear you two are new. Welcome to Kentucky. Thank you. Yeah, just, uh, moved out from L.A. with my husband. L.A.? Wait. Danny? Yeah. It-it's a small town. I heard he moved back. So, you're Danny's wife. I'm Sara. Allie. Ooh, I love your mood ring. Thank you. According to this, I'm always in a good mood. I-I went to school with Danny. I was so sorry to hear about his mom. She was so great. Wasn't she amazing? Honestly, she was more of a mother to me than my own mom. I really miss her. Yeah, she used to come in here every Sunday after church. She would always get the... Hot brown. Hot brown. Oh. Jinx. Buy me a coke. What's a hot brown? Uh, it's... toast, with turkey and bacon and mornay sauce. It's really good. Well, how about a couple in her honor? Yes. Oh, you should probably hold off. It sounds really good but really rich. Maybe for the heartburn... Yeah. Okay, hang on. Mediterranean salad please. I might get the hot brown. Uh, yeah. Sorry. Uh, anything to drink? I'll get a sweet tea, please. Just water for me. Mm, no caffeine for the baby? Yeah. Well, I will get going on the hot brown and the salad, and I will be right back with your delicious water. Thanks. She's great. Yeah. I guess you must miss L.A. Must be so much fun. Yeah. You know, we were gonna sell the house out here, but then this job opportunity came up for Danny, and that just made sense, you know? Were you working? Yeah, I worked at a law firm. Wow, you're a lawyer. Yeah, well... not here. I still have to take the bar. Which reminds me, I should probably start studying for the bar. And you gave all that up just for Danny. My job? No! No, no, I, I'll go back to it. I just, um, I wanted to give Eloise the whole Americana childhood, you know? Where she can play outside on... a lawn that isn't yellow. But it's no big city. No. I don't know, just post a few pictures on social media and friends will come running. Yeah, I don't really do that social media stuff. Oh, yeah. Family problems? You just mentioned your mom. Yeah. Whoa, you're good. Um... Let's just say I have people I don't wanna connect with. I get it. Sorry for prying. No, not at all. My mum's kind of a whack-a-doodle too. So sorry. Uh, Sara, in case you didn't know, there is a Mommy meet-up here, every Wednesday. Mommy meet-up? What's that? Is that like a gang? It sounds like a gang. It's a gang, isn't it? Just tell Kelly how much you love her purse. Tell her it's real fancy. She's the organizer, and she can be a bit, you know... Gotcha. I don't know, I don't wanna intrude. No, no, you should totally go. You should totally go. Okay, I'll... Maybe I'll go. I'll think about it. Hm. Thanks. Well, it was so nice to meet you. Thank you so much for today. This was so nice. Honestly, I was nervous being here. You... made me feel a little better. Of course. It's my job, make pregnant women feel better. I'm like a lighthouse guiding them through their hormonal fog and helping them avoid the dangers around them. Can you be my midwife? Oh. Sorry. I... It's just, you make me feel so much better already, and... I would be really grateful. You've only got six more weeks, and I promise, you're doing so great without me. Yeah, I'm a mess. This is a facade. To be honest, I generally prefer to start with people at the beginning of their pregnancy. I always wanted to have a natural birth. I didn't think I'd find anyone here to help me with it. Meeting you... feel like it's fate. All right, you talked me into it. Really? Yeah. I'm gonna pay you, it's not like a friend thing. No, no, no. It... I'll give you a huge discount from my usual rate. Sound good? Yay, that would be great. Awesome. Can I... Thank you. Oh. This is gonna be fun. Yes. Hm... So, a midwife, huh? How'd you find a midwife out here? She was at the hospital. It was totally fate. Oh. Well, I... You needed a midwife. You have no idea what a midwife is, do you? No. They specialize in pregnancy, um... labor, delivery, postpartum. They're trained to deal with any high-risk situations. Mm-hm. She's a lighthouse... guiding pregnant women through their hormonal fog and helping them avoid the dangers all around them. That's great. I just don't feel anxious around her. You know, she makes me feel so calm. I love her already. I was telling her about your mom. How great she was, and... how supportive. Remember, she used to send me late-night pizzas in law school? She's my mom goal. Hey. You don't need to try so hard. You're you. And havin' a terrible mother doesn't mean that you're gonna be a terrible mother. That's not how it works. What if I just looked down at my baby one day... and feel... trapped? Like I gave up something. It's possible. That doesn't scare you? No, not one bit. Because I'm not gonna let you feel trapped. And you're not gonna let me feel trapped... because we're a team. Okay? I promise. And I'm here for you. I know. The fact that you're massaging my feet right now says it all. Yeah. I know. Yeah. I know how you are. Yeah. I'm probably gonna have nightmares. I know, sorry. For sure. Hey. Hi. I made you a killer lasagna. Special recipe, guaranteed not to give you heartburn. That is so sweet of you. Come on in. Oh, your house is beautiful. Thank you. This way. This smells so good. Okay. So, I thought we could get started on your birth plan. Sounds great. Danny and I haven't figured out what we wanna do yet. So I just need to figure out how to not go insane over the next couple weeks. Well, I have tons of ideas. Actually, I thought we could get started by enrolling you in some pre-natal yoga classes. How does that sound? I'm from L.A., so I love yoga and avocados. Great. Well, we can start off with some morning classes and just ease you back into it gradually. Perfect. Do you want some wine? I can, uh, watch you drink it. No, actual octuplets. That was good. Oh. Hey. Hey. I'm good, honey. How's it going, ladies? How you doing? Good. Hey. This is Jina. Our midwife. It is so nice to meet you. Daniel. Um... Sara's been nothing but smiles since she met you. Glad to hear it. We've been going through our plan for the next few weeks, and, uh, she's telling me all these pregnancy stories 'cause she has seen it all. And more. Yeah, I bet. Oh, goodness, I better get going. Do you wanna stay for dinner? No, no, no, I'll let you guys do your lovebird thing. She made me non-burny lasagna. Pfft, I'm in. Please stay. We could use the company. Okay then. Great. Good. So, are you gonna go to that Mommy meet-up group tomorrow? Mommy meet-up? It's a mothers' group. They get together once a week. It's like a support network. Oh. Sounds perfect. Mm, I don't know. I never know what to say at those things. Well, I think it could be really good for you. It's important to be around other mothers. It helps. Maybe just bring a big salad and a huge smile, and you'll be fine. Oh, this is so weird. I feel like a science experiment. I feel like this isn't my body. Oh, yeah, it was the same with me. Uh, you have kids? No, I... My baby was stillborn. I'm so sorry. I lost him in the third trimester. We had, uh, losses, too, but... nothing that late. I'm... I'm so, so sorry. It's okay. It was a rough couple of years. My husband left, and then I had to move in with my mom who isn't the easiest person to live with. But I managed to get through school, get my midwife license, get out of there. Actually, I understand that, too. My mom, uh, took out a bunch of credit cards in my name and wrecked my credits, so, we have to stay away from her too. Well, I've managed to save up enough now, so... I'm really close to getting my own place. For now, I'm just staying in a motel. The only bummer is there doesn't seem to be a huge demand for midwives around here. Um, I'm sorry. This is way too much information. No, I mean, embarrassing. You're about to see all of this very soon, so... just... we're way past embarrassing. Sorry. You should stay with us, at least for a little while, you know, while you find a place to stay. Please stay, we have so much room. Oh. Yeah, plenty of room. And don't, don't be embarrassed, you know? Like, everyone needs help sometimes, and you're helping me so much. So, why don't you just stay with us till you find a place? I mean, I do really hate that motel. Great. Done. Hello. Hello, hello, you're new. Welcome to Mommy meet-up. I'm Kelly. I'm Sara. Nice to meet you. Ah, and you brought a salad. You didn't have to. We have food here. Oh, I, I didn't know. Ladies, I'd like you to meet our new friend Sarah. Is that Sarah with an H? Uh, no, just an A on the end. Fancy. Hi, it's nice to meet you guys. Um, we just moved here from L.A. a few weeks ago. Yes, and Sara brought us a salad. Tsk. Ah, yup. It's kale and quinoa, one of my favorites. Quinoa? Tsk. It's a grain, Amanda. I've had it before. And kale. Interesting. Oh, a quinoa salad. I'll have to get that recipe from you, Sara. It might be great for the menu. Someone pour her some sweet tea. Oh. No, thank you, actually. You don't like sweet tea? Oh. No, I love it. I just... I'm avoiding caffeine and sugar. Hm. I'd never be able to give up my sweet tea. You're so dedicated. Oh. Mommy meet-up! Mommy meet-up! Let's take a selfie. Oh, no. Sorry. No, thank you. What? Why not? It's not a big deal, it's just for our Facebook page. I just don't do Facebook... and stuff. Tsk. What for? You hidin' somethin'? No, I just, uh, have some family... issues... So, you moved here a few weeks ago? Yeah, into my mother-in-law's house on Cochrane. Oh! Daniel's mom. Tsk. I went to school with Danny. I was a couple of years behind him, though, obviously. That's great. So, when are you due? Ah, six more weeks. Can't wait. You okay? Yeah, it's just a headache. I think it's allergies. Do you guys get those? Oh, no problem, we mommies have it all covered. I have some meds. Oh, no, thank you so much. I'll be okay. It's just Tylenol. Yeah, I just try not to take anything unless I really need it, you know? My doctor said it was okay. Oh, I'm sure it is. He seemed reputable. My doctor. No, no, no, of course. Are you a doctor? No, I'm a lawyer, actually. Oh. That makes sense. I just didn't wanna take any risks, you know? Right. So, how about that salad? Yeah, um, I'm actually gonna run to the restroom really quick, uh, for the millionth time today. Hey, what's up? Oh, I'm fine. Whoa, wait, wait. What happened? Did you forget to compliment Kelly's purse? Yes. Forgot about the purse. I panicked. Um, they're really nice. I just... They all really know each other, and I don't really fit in, and I brought this weird salad. Why am I crying over salad? Uh, okay. Phone. My... Oh. Come on. Here is my number. I'm officially your friend, and I am awesome. So call or text me anytime. Uh, but no emojis, okay? I hate those things. Little weird faces. Yeah, they really creep me out. Me too. See? I knew we were gonna be BFFs. Thank you. This house is amazing. It's like a museum. Danny's mom treated it like one. Hm. All she needed was an armed guard. Oh, there's a gun and everything. Really? Yeah. Someone has to protect her porcelain fawn collection. I'm actually not a big fan of guns, so Danny put it in the bedroom safe. We'll get rid of it when all of this calms down. Yeah, they kinda freak me out. Me too. Oh. I have a surprise for you. To say thank you for your generosity. Thank you so much. I'm gonna open it right now. Oh, I love it. It's supposed to ignite the flames of romance. Oh. I know it can be hard to keep those fires lit during pregnancy. What, with all the excess weight gain and stretch marks. It can be kinda hard to be sexy. But I thought you could put it in your room. I will. Thank you. And now I have to use the restroom again. When I get back, we have to do something fun. Sounds good. Ugh, that meet-up was brutal. I'm sorry. Those moms are harmless. I mean, yeah, it sucks, but it's good for you to be around other mothers. Honestly, I'd love to fit in with them. I'm not trying to be elitist or anything, I... I genuinely think they're nice people. Maybe you should just start taking a ton of selfies. Okay, I thought that was just me, but they take a lot of photos, right? Well, that's how the world works. If you don't post it online, it-it never happened. No, of course not. I can help you with that, if you want. Uh... hmm. It's very complicated. Here is the camera. Mm-hm. And then I just take a quick snap. Yup, uh... And you're right, that, that's terrible, that's... Mean. It's really terrible. You're so mean. But seriously, though, don't post that, 'cause I, I can't do social media, so... don't post it. Yeah, of course. Okay. I do think we should take photos, though. For Eloise. She's gonna wanna see you like this. You're beautiful. Okay, you're right. Here, hold this. I'll get a better angle. Better light. All right. Smile. Lawyers don't smile, it's in the rules. Actually, I don't know, like, give it some vibe, like, I don't know, like, just, loosen up a little bit. Um, how about you pretend you're at a party and you're drinking? What? I don't know, have a drink. Go nuts. There we go. One, two, three. Perfect. That's great. Honey, I'm home. Hey, baby. What have you two wild ladies been up to? We've been taking selfies. Sara... taking a photo? We're not posting them or anything, right? Promise. Oh, I have something I have to show you. Ah. Here. Hey. Hi. Danny... um, we missed you at dinner tonight. I saved you some leftovers, if you want them. I, uh, you know, actually, I'm good. I, I ate at my desk, but thank you. Oh, my gosh. I can barely... I can barely... feel you. Mm-hm. So... how'd it go? How was your day? Mm... Unh-unh. Come on. Come on, how was the mommy gang initiation? Oh. I cried. I mean, I know, at this point, I, I cry at dog food commercials, but I... I made one friend. Yeah. Allie. She's fun. I can't wait to meet her. You know, I know we have a long way to go on the rest of the house, but I feel like... this room's finally done. Mm-hm. Maybe. Maybe. Oh, I forgot the best part. Okay. Oh. Yeah. Hans? Hans? Oh! I... Pfft, where'd you... Where'd you get that? That... silly bear. Did you find it in the garbage? I found him carefully tucked away with some of your mom's old things. Really? Mm-hm. Um, I forgot all about that. Right. Mm-hm. Should we put Hans in the crib? Uh... I mean, we can, we can take a look. We can take a look. Oh. Unless you want it in our bed... No. I... I guess our kid should have it. Oh. Stupid bear. Hm. Very generous of you. Ow. Oh, you look... comfortable. I'm not. Hang on. Okay. I can do this. You all right? Get up for one second. Just one second. Sorry. I just... Okay. Yeah. It's so hot. I'm uncomfortable. Did you touch the thermostat? What? Did you? No. Okay, like, one degree. One degree... You keep it like an icebox in here. Okay, well, in the eyes of the court, I can reduce my sentence from murder to manslaughter. I'm saying I'm legally allowed to murder you now. I think what's important to remember... is that I love you and you love me. Yeah. I love you. Get some rest, okay? Okay. Everything is looking really good. I feel good. You seem good. Oh, I forgot to tell you. I hired Jina Anderson as my midwife. I should tell you that, right? It feels like it's something I should tell you. No, it's fine, it's fine, uh... If she makes you feel more secure, then I'm on board. Does this mean that you're gonna have a home birth? I don't know yet. Okay. Well, just, uh, keep checkin' in with me and let me know how things are going. Okay. Okay? Thank you. All right, see you later. Okay, when you're ready, try to come out of the pose. Uh, you're so good. Yeah, well, I had some ribs removed to do that one. It's worth it. Totally worth it. That's weird. Like a cramp or something? Yeah, kinda like a cramp. Um... It's in the front there, right? Not the back? Yeah. Okay, I'm just gonna have to feel your abdomen. Oh, that's pretty hard. Okay, and you're sure it's just in the front? Yeah. Okay. It's all right, it's fine. It's just Braxton Hicks. Okay. Like the practice contractions. Yeah. It's just getting you ready for the big day. It's totally normal. Okay. Sorry, I know I shouldn't get so worried, I just... I just wanna be, I don't know, prepared or something 'cause we're on again. No, of course, you're fine. This is totally normal. Let's get you upstairs for some rest. Yeah, okay. Okay. That's it. All right... I'm just gonna get you some tea. Okay. Boy, you're really lucky I came along. You're so weak. Yeah. Did you do any pre-natal exercises at all? Yeah, no, I'm fine. I just get really dizzy on the stairs. Okay. Be sure to lay on your left side up there. I will. Lay back if you can. Here... Take some deep breaths. How are you feeling? It's actually starting to get better. Sara! I'm up here. Danny came home? Yeah, I called him. Oh. I thought you left your phone downstairs. The landline. Oh. What is this, 1994? Yeah. Danny's mother had all the modern conveniences of the '80s. We were gonna get rid of it, but... cell service is so spotty out here and... texting only works with Wi-Fi. Hey. Hey. You okay? Ugh, I'm sorry. I just... We were doing yoga and I... S-stop, no, don't be sorry. It's okay. It's just Braxton Hicks. Ah. It's like practice labor. She'll be fine. It just hurt for a little bit. It's fine now. Jina fixed it. So, you came all the way home. Yeah. It's fine. I'm, I'm super close, so... I can come running anytime Sara needs me. It's good to know. You okay? I'm okay. Now that I'm locked away up in my tower... Oh... Listen, I brought some work home. But, I can, you know, I can save it for later. Do you wanna turn on some reality TV? Make fun of the crazies? Watch the little cray-cray people. I know, I'm just so tired and... emotional. I feel like I messed up. Like I over-exerted myself or... Did Jina seem mad at me? No, no, not at all. It's just... I know she wants me to take it easy, but... I can't... Well, you... ...be cooped up all the time. You do, uh, need to get some rest, okay, so, just take it easy. Okay. You should drop by and surprise her if you have time. That's great, she really needs this. You know, she's been so stressed out. See you later. Yeah, bye. Have a good day. Good morning. How are you feeling? Good, I can't believe I slept so much. That's good. Your body needed it. Was Danny... Oh, he left for work. Oh, I thought I heard you guys talking. Yeah, but he had to rush out. He's still behind from yesterday having to come home for you. He couldn't really wait around. Oh. Anyhoo, get dressed. Dressed for what? I found the most amazing yoga studio in town. I wanna take you there. Can't keep you cooped up all day. I just wanna grab a quick cup of coffee. Oh, okay, great. Oh-oh! Surprise! What? Did you do this? Maybe. You guys... I wish I was better dressed. I didn't wanna spoil the surprise. Thank you, thank you so much. Okay... I can't cry again. Aww! Oh, mine! Mine, that one's mine. Oh, I needed one of these. Aww! Thank you, Allie. You're welcome. Uh, next one. That one's mine. Oh, you really didn't have to. This is amazing. Done more than enough. ♪ I believe Oh, what's it say? It's Eloise's initials. Aw. Thank you. I love it. Really. No, Sara, thank you. Um, Ashley, can we get some more sweet tea? Uh, yeah. Oh. But no sweet tea for this one. Isn't it weird that you used to date her Danny? It's weird, right? Who? Allie? Oh, well... Kind of. Oh, no, you guys were so cute. I-I mean it was like maybe two months during high school. Oh, gosh, it seemed longer than that. How funny. Yeah, that's really funny. Um, you know I should probably get back, so, you ladies let me know if you need anything, okay? Uh, next gift? Thank you so much, guys, I really appreciate all this. Aw! Wow, that was in perfect unison. They've literally been practicin' it all day. Yeah, I bet. You look so handsome. Hi, ladies, hey. Oh. There she is. Aww. Hey, baby. I brought these for you. Hi. How're you doin'? So good. I just came by to help you take home all your loot. I can't believe you knew. It was... really hard not to say anything. He is so good at keeping secrets. We were just talkin' about you and Allie. Allie? Hey, Danny. AJ? What... are you doing here? Oh. I haven't been called that in forever. Um, actually, I own this cafe. Wow. That's, that's amazing. Yeah, I feel like such an idiot. Uh, when you mentioned Allie before, I just, I didn't make the connection. We went to school together. Yes. You guys must've been such a cute couple. No, it didn't last long. Uh, that, uh, Halloween party? You thought you could break-dance and then you puked on my shoe. It's embarrassing, yeah, thanks for that. That's like, at our wedding. Your dancing at our wedding. This is good, thank you for bringing me up and humiliating me. I'm glad you two met. Yeah. This is good. Honey, if you have to go back to work, we can get the stuff home. Yeah. We've got this. Oh, yeah. I-I can help too. Oh, it's okay. No, no, I'd love to. Uh, Ash, I'm gonna head out. Just gimme a sec. Wanna see the stuff? Yes, let's see. No worries, I've got these ones too. Today was so lovely. Thank you so much for making it happen. I'm happy to help. Oh, I might just get your number. Just in case you get lost. Oh. I know how to get to Danny's. Oh, of course. But, it's been so long. Ayee, where is my phone? Here you go. It's hard to find anything in this mess. Great. I'm just gonna grab a couple more things. Of course. How cute this is. Oh, my gosh. Aw. Oh my gosh. They're so cute. So cute dolphins. Ooh, I don't believe... It's amazing. Yeah. So cute. Ooh. Oh! Thank you, Ma'am. Oh, thank you. Delicious. To a successful baby shower. Oh, wait, wait, wait, pictures pictures, pictures. We're trying to take more pictures with Sara, she's, uh, photographically-challenged. One in five Americans has it. Oh, shoot. So tragic. One, two, three. One more. Give me somethin' else. Bigger... bigger! Great. So... what's the next step for you? Isn't there a birth plan, or... That's a thing, right? Isn't that a thing? That's a thing. Um... I'm kinda on the fence. I'm leaning toward having a home birth. Tsk, maybe, uh... Danny's still kinda nervous. I talked to him again last night. You did? Oh... You were asleep and I didn't wanna stress you out. Oh, yeah, right, um... Danny's still, like, a little nervous about the home birth, but, um... If we had the baby at the hospital, would you still be with us? Of course. I'll be with you till the end. So, uh, a home birth, how does that, how does that work? Oh, we have the baby here. What happens if there's, like, a problem? Like bleeding or if the baby has trouble breathing or... I-I'm sorry, I'm just really curious. I'm trained to deal with those situations. Oh, so you're a doctor? No. I'm a licensed and certified midwife. But not a doctor? No. Women have been having babies without hospitals for centuries. I just, I feel like it's so important to be calm and comfortable in your surroundings. Yeah. No, that, that makes total sense. Again, I'm-I'm totally ignorant about the whole thing. I'm sorry to be a bug. No! I'm gonna take these up to the baby's room. Thank you so much. Pleasure. Hm. So good. Sara, I hope I didn't... I don't know... hurt your feelings. What? With Danny? No! No. No, no, no. No. It's fine. Absolutely not, no. So that's a "no"? Yes! Sorry, I-I just, I didn't think it was a big deal or anything. I mean, we were just kids. And, to reiterate, he barfed... on my shoes. That's my charmin' man. And I promise, I shall reveal each and every dark secret I can think of. Okay. Me too. Um... Oh, I, uh... ...only put mustard on burgers. Don't know why. Well... I hate muffins. Monster! I don't know, maybe because I'm tired of making them. I-I mean I like baking. I like the cafe, but, honestly, I'm only doin' this for travel money. Oh, I love travelling. Right? I, I just love being able to hop on a plane whenever I want to, wherever I want. There've been a lot of times recently that I've wanted to run away from here. Yeah. Yeah, I-I know you wanna fit in. And you will, honestly. I promise you will find what's important to you here. Just don't change to fit in, huh? You're right. Thank you. Oh, thank you so much. It was awesome, you're so welcome. You're so nice! Well, I am super tired, so you must be exhausted. Yes, I'll tell Jina you said goodnight. Oh, you don't have to. Oh, I wished you liked muffins, you maniac. What can I say? Have a good night. Later. Jina? Are you all right? What're you doing out here? Is, uh, something wrong with my gift? We need to talk. Yeah, let's do this. What's your problem with me? I'm just here to help Sara and Daniel. I see your little games. You have a very active imagination. Sara's distracted right now, but I see you pulling strings. Okay, I don't know what you want or what you're tryin' to do. But I'll figure it out sooner or later. That's easy. I want her baby. What? Are you nuts? No. No, I'm not. Just waiting for the drugs to kick in. What did you... Your drink. Uh... Uh... There we go. Nice and easy. It was a really thoughtful gift. Sara mentioned that you were on the fence about the home birth, I was just... wondering because we're kinda getting down to the wire with the decision. I'm sorry, I've just, I've been so stressed out with work. It's fine. Sara's torn... I mean, she's really pro home birth but she wants to make sure you're comfortable. I mean, you really think we could do this? Here? I do. You are amazing. Uh. Honestly, I, um... I would do anything for Sara. I just want her to be comfortable. So, um, I don't know how women do it. Good morning. What are you... You got your coffee? I was gonna make it for you. Yeah, no... Oh, it's fine. You just go rest. Okay. Thank you. Hey. Hey. Didn't hear you come in last night. Yeah, I'm sorry, honey, I got off late. I didn't wanna wake you up. Well, you gonna be home for dinner tonight? Uh, I gotta pull some more overtime. Again? Why? Well, the guys at the office just needs me to cover some stuff for 'em. Are you hiding something? What? No. Okay. I love you. I love you. Have a good day, okay? Okay. All right. Bye. Mm-hm. Bye. Hey. Hey! Hey, was Danny all right this morning? He seems kinda off. Oh, yeah, I think he's just tired. Right. Yeah. W-what's that? Allie's number. Oh. You should keep that. She's great. I really like her. It was in Danny's pocket. Hey. Don't be paranoid. I know you feel huge and unattractive right now but Danny really loves you. Yeah, I'm... who puts a number on a napkin anyways. Listen. Don't even worry about it. I mean, when would he even have time? He works really late and he never even eats here. Yeah, I gotta get groceries on a bank near the house. Well, maybe I could make him something nice. That'd be nice. You look lost. Dr. Collins. Hi! How are you? Good. Just grabbing some lunch. How are you feeling? Good. Mm, you sure? You seem a little upset. No, sorry, I'm just distracted. Um... Oh, I did have some Braxton Hicks. But everything is fine now. How often? None today. Okay. Well, why don't you come by my office when you can and we'll finalize your birthing plan. Yeah, I'm actually leaning toward a home birth. Jina and I've been looking at tubs. Jina? My midwife. Oh, right, yeah, you mentioned her. Um, I don't know her. Really? You said hi to her when we were at the hospital. This is the south. We say hi to everybody. Plus, I'm super popular at the hospital. I bet. As long as she's certified and licensed, just keep me in the loop, okay? Okay. All right? Hey. Hey. Sorry. Oh, you finished shopping? I got caught up talking to Dr. Collins. Oh. It was weird. He said he doesn't know you. Typical doctor stuff. I'm sure if you said, the cute blonde with a nice rack, he'd probably remember. It's all right. I'll just call him later. Did you see Allie there? No. Um, she's out of town. That's weird. She didn't mention that yesterday. Sorry. It's fine. She texted. Yeah, still. You shouldn't have someone flaky in your life right now. Do you wanna get outta here? Yeah. What are you looking for? My blue shirt. It's hanging up. It's not. It is, Danny. It's not here. Really? Well, I'm sorry about it. You said that you unpacked it. I did. It's in here. Okay, I, I just can't-can't do this right now. I have to study for the bar. I'm just not gonna have the time or energy to do when the baby's here. You have to go to this conference. It's important to you and... It's overtime. I just need a little help here, okay? Some help. Okay. What more can I do? I mean, I'm working day and night for you. Well, it's for us. And I'm all alone here. Okay? You just pop in here and there and you talk to Jina more than you talk to me. No, I don't. You told her I was feeling cooped up. I don't remember that but it's not hard to see that you're going stir crazy. I found Allie's number in your pants. No, you didn't. It was on a napkin in the laundry. You had a ton of stuff in the laundry, too. Maybe it got mixed in with your stuff. So you're saying it isn't yours? Something is wrong here. I can feel it. Anyway, who the hell writes a number on a napkin anyway? I mean, if I was gonna get a number, I would put it in my phone. Can you just stop cranking up the heat? Jeez, like once. I wake up every night sweating. Maybe that's because you might be pregnant. Oh, wait. You are. Where are you going? I'm gonna go cool off. Not in this sweat box! Huh. You're still awake. Feeling pretty stressed out. Hm. Third trimester. So much going on. For the mother... For the dad, too. I just... feel like I'm not doing enough. Have you ever thought about taking a Lamaze class? Yeah. I've heard of 'em. I just... It could be really helpful, you know? They teach you techniques to help Sara through the labor and support her. Okay. Yeah. I, I can look at my schedule. You know, I mean, I could probably teach you a few things if you like. Just get you started, and then you guys can practice them together. It might really help. Uh, yeah. That could work. Here. This is a really good one. Put your hands here. Hey, relax. This is for Sara. Put your hands lower and you support her abdomen. Like this? Mm-hm. Now... help her take long... deep... breaths. Let your breath... support hers. Is this right? I-I... You're perfect. Well, uh... Uh, thanks. That was really relaxing. I'm, I'm gonna turn in. Uh... But thank you for all your help. Um, I'll talk to Sara about taking a class together. Of course. Goodnight. Goodnight. I... feel... bad about our fight. Couples fight. I feel like we're on t-two different islands, you know? We need to swim back to each other. Tell me what you wanna do. Tell me what you want, I'll make it happen. Well, we've, we've already lost two babies. I can't go through that again. I, I know that you're strong. And I know Jina knows what she's doing. But I'm worried that if something goes wrong, I'm gonna be the one that makes the mistake. And... I've just been so tired lately that... I'm, I'm somehow gonna drop the ball. Okay. Okay? We'll have our baby at the hospital. I, I don't wanna make you do this. You're not. I could have a natural birth there. And if it makes you feel better and more secure, then it's what I want. Okay. We can do a home birth for the next one. Deal. I promise you... I will be right there cheering you on. I know. Morning. Morning. There's some tea over there. Oh. You haven't been hydrating enough. I think that's why you've been so weak. Do you want some oatmeal? Sure. That sounds great. Excellent. So, you must be tired. I heard you and Danny fighting last night. Um, yeah, it was silly. We're fine now. We made up. Oh. That's good. We shared a really good talk and, um, we're gonna have the baby at the hospital. That's too bad. Well, there's so much to take in. I'm glad that you and Danny examined both possibilities. So, yeah, hospital it is. Perfect. Since you'll be by our side, I feel like we can achieve the best of both worlds, you know? Thank you for being so supportive. Of course. Now, go lay down. I'll bring you your oatmeal. Thanks. Mm. I put extra strawberries in it. You need your minerals and fiber. Thank you so much. Eat up. Enjoy. Mm. I'm having pain. In the front, like before? No, in the back, like, deep. That sounds like real contractions. It's too soon. Um... What do I do? Okay. Nice and slow. Do you have that tea you made me earlier? After I call Dr. Collins, I'll get you some. Okay. There you go. Easy. Yeah. Her temperature's fine. Blood pressure's normal. They're really far apart but they're definitely real contractions. Yup. Yup. Oh. You think so? Oh. Oh, sure. Mm. No, no, no, I totally agree. Oh, absolutely. Yeah. Oh, let's hear it now. Mm-hm. Oh. Thank you so much, Doctor. All right. Buh-bye now. Thank you. We're gonna have to keep you on bed rest. Really? But do I have to go in and see him? He said I could just call to check in. Hey, this is pretty common. Well, particularly at this time and with your history... Okay. I'm not gonna lie. Bed rest is tough. But you're tough. We're gonna need to minimize activity to 15 minutes a day. Keep you away from stairs. So, we can't have you collapsing or fainting. We'll make a plan for showers. But, apart from that, you're just gonna have to relax and try to get some rest. I'm coming home. I'm fine. Jina's here. You're only, what? Two hours away? What did Dr. Collins say? Jina talked to him this afternoon. He said right now, I just need to lie back and relax. So I'm in my worst nightmare. Just... I just hate leaving you like this. Well, it's only a few days. Almost a week. Well, Jina will call if there's any problems. Okay. Well, I love you. I love you, too. Yes! Hello? Hi, Kelly, it's Sara. Oh. Hello. Sorry, I missed the last Mommy meet-up. I've been sentenced to bed rest. That must be nice. Yes. Um... I just wanted to say thank you for coming to my baby shower. And, uh, since I'm on bed rest, I thought, maybe I could host the next Mommy meet-up, and everybody could come over, I'll order food... No. We've already scheduled it. Thanks for calling. Sorry... Kelly, wait. Did I do something to offend you? I don't like being made a fool of. And I just can't associate with someone who lies to me. Mm, what do you mean "lies"? You act all high and mighty. Not drinking sweet tea or taking medicine, but then you go out drinking? What are you talking about? I should report you to child services. You're out of control. Okay, stop. I... Where is this coming from? We saw you. All of us. Where? Online. I thought you were too good for social media. I can't believe you posted those pics. Or are you too drunk to remember? What you doin'? I was just looking up breast feeding tips. You look kinda guilty. Just didn't want you to think I was looking at pictures of boobs. Well, I actually brought this up so you could prop your back up if you wanted but... guess you could use it to practice. Right. Do you need a hat? No. Thank you so much for lunch. You've reached the Bassinet. How can I help you? Hi. I got a necklace from you guys and the clasp just broke. Oh, so sorry about that. We can issue you a refund or a replacement. Great. It's a silver heart. Uh, engraved E-H-M. E-H-M. And where was it shipped? Kentucky. Uh, got it right here. Um, this was a gift. So, I don't have the receipt. No problem. We can refund to credit card. Okay. Uh, Jina Anderson's, right? This says "Laurie Ann Phelps." Right. Jina gave me the diaper bag. I'll let Laurie know. Thank you. Okay, have a great day. No. No, no, no. No, no. Danny... Okay. Oh, honey. I warned you about those stairs. Oh. You're awake. Would you say that your contractions are ten minutes apart or more like 15? Danny's on his way home. Oh, yeah. You really shouldn't have texted him. I had plans for him later, I-I just want to keep this easy for you, and now I'm gonna have to kill him in front of you, which is gonna be really upsetting and... it's just not good for the baby. Why are you doing this? Oh, come on, Sara. I have to do what's right for the baby. That's my job. You and Danny are perfect, physically. And you're gonna have a strong, beautiful baby. But emotionally... you're weak. And I'm not gonna let another strong child get ruined by this pathetic world. Look at me. A world full of people like you... who thinks society's supposed to change for them. That's not how the world works. The world doesn't cut you breaks. Life is tough. And you have to learn to take what you need. I can teach my baby that. I can. You're... "Crazy"? Is that what you said? Psychotic. Well, thanks for not calling me crazy. It's so derogatory for women, you know? Actually, uh, it's pretty misogynistic. That's a whole other story. I'm gonna get you some water. You gotta stay hydrated. Hey, honey! Did you call the cops? What? Danny! Yeah. No, no, you stay. He called me after you texted. I told him the baby was coming. He was so excited. You know, I actually thought about sparing him for a minute. I mean, clearly he wants me. How does that make you feel? I thought I'd make a nice, kind, beautiful midwife. You know, just coming to the aid of a newly widowed father. Yeah, but then I figured it was just better to wipe the slate clean. Nice murder-suicide by a depressed alcoholic pregnant lady. See, you burn the house down with you in it and him and the baby. It's pretty neat, huh? I mean, it'll be weeks before they sift through the ashes to see if they find anything. Oh, she's coming. I'm gonna get you some towels. Sara? Where are you? This isn't very responsible. Sara? Oh, God, you bitch! You're not gonna make it, city girl. You're on your own, I made sure of that. The mommies group hates you, Dr. Collins thinks you don't need him. And Danny? Even Danny wasn't sure about you in the end. And Allie... Poor sweet Allie. You know that little trip she went on? Yeah... Her car's at the airport. But they'll find her body in your woods! Sara? Sara? Where are you, princess? Come on, city girl. Why are you making this so difficult? Sara? Sara? Sara, think about what you're doing. You're one of the smartest women I know. A good other would do anything for her baby. Anything. Even sacrifice her own life. I would have done anything for my baby. Anything! How'd you get up there? She left without you, Danny. How does that make you feel? Wonder if she'll come back when I do... this. Danny? What? You're going for your gun? Yeah, Sara already told me about your little toy. We're besties. She tells me everything. I already tried for the gun myself. I thought it'd be a nicer way to go out. Seemed so peaceful. Now I have to burn this whole place down. All because... I couldn't get into your safe! Honestly... you didn't use Sara's birthday for your code? What kind of man does that? If I may be so bold... indicates problems for your marriage. Wait, wait. I don't have time to wait but this begging is adorable. I'm not beggin'. What? I'm gettin' out of the way. The combination was our anniversary, you bitch! I'm sorry, honey... We've lost everything. No, we haven't. You were right. We have everything we need right here. Come on.
