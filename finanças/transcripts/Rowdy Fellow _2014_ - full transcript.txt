Just 10 Lakhs! & I will take care of the rest. I will give 20 Lakhs and stop it anyhow! So You will not go! Krishna! The kid is not ready for the transfer. Brother! This is a small town... Here no one knows what may happen... What if anything happens to you? I cannot tolerate it. If anything happens to me.... Are not you there for me? Big brother? What is that you liked here? You! Krishna! Get the vehicle! Brother! It is pleasure to pee in open air. Brother Krishna! At least let us pee with peace! What Big brother? How come you let him go today? You just order me... I will finish him! Brother Krishna! Did you ever give a close look to an ambulance? I hope you did not. Brother! You must control some! You must defeat some! And you must teach lessons to some! Go on then! Brother! Give me some water to wash my shirt! Hey! Why did you cut my phone? Tell me? Why did you cut my call? Actually I was busy. Why are you laughing now? I just got free! If so... why did you not call me then? - Actually that... Go now! Why are you being so harsh? It was better when you used to call me as Sir! Please do not shout! That is all till you guys propose us! Later it is all in our control. If this repeats.... Look even if you are dying.... Give me a call & only then die! Never tell me that you are busy! Sir! The vehicle is ready! - He is gone! Is he your fan? I will come later! Wait! Madame! Tell me your number! What for... Madame? If he will not answer my call... I will call you instead! And if you start telling me stories... I will tell my father that you are teasing me! Madame! You guys are busy right! You may go! Come Sir! Reddy! It is pleasure riding without traffic signals. Sir! Madame looks very violent Sir! - Reddy!! Sir! Why do you think... what I do not think? Sorry Sir! Reddy... Stop the vehicle! Salutes! Hey kid where you going? - To home. This is the way to go to our village. Get inside! What do you do Old man? I work for Durga Prasad. How much do you earn? I will take whatever they give. Not how much you deserve for? You are speaking like my son! Anyone speaks this way itself... not just your son. Hey kid! Your grandfather is correct... you stop roaming with him. Son!.. Please stop the vehicle here. Your name is Suvarnalatha! Which means... Brother! Silk! Sorry brother! Brother! Brother! Brother! Why are you here? Toyota Innova! It is 20 lakhs in the market... But it is free for you! Brother! Bucket seats... AC is too good... It goes 120 Kmph... & it is free for you! What brother! Is there any lion in the station? Why did he come here again..? As you completed the case for first time... Dad has sent you a gift. Suvarnalatha! I have also got swift desire... & it is free for you. Hey silk! Coming brother! Brother! I have convinced my brother & bought you this.. It is very thrilling brother! Boss! Oh my goodness! Porsche Carrera! Not just me! Even my brother is father will not be able to get this! Brother! I have got some English girlfriends... May I please borrow this for an hour for a ride? Lets see! I love you brother! Hey Reddy! - Sir! How come that easily they give a 20 lakhs car? What do they do? Sir! Even the newspaper would not be enough to write about you sir! What are you guys doing? We have been collecting bribes as usual Sir. Are not you ashamed of saying that? As you have a sports car... You did not accept that Innova car... Whereas how do we fulfil our wishes? Are not you getting your salaries? Do not mind Sir... How much do you think your salary is? Probably around 50 to 60 thousand! I guess you have never seen your salary slip... Yours is 14500 Rs & mine is 8800 Rs. For just this... why a baton? A cap? & a designation called SP! Sir! What are you saying? Wait for tomorrow! Hey! Where are you going? - They have asked us to come! Big Brother Giri! It is Police. Why have you come here? Our Sir asked us to collect funds to teach lessons for the crooks! Hey! Do you realise what you are speaking & to whom? Brother! It is not for us... it is for the crooks! Are not we politicians? Big brother! Give them 10000 bucks & ask them to leave! But our Sir have told us not to accept more than 500 Rs! Looks like they are fixed on something... Big Brother! Give them what they ask! Did you call me? Are you a Police or a Rowdy? I heard that you are collecting bribes! You are insulting the police! I am watching! Do not think that I am not! You think yourself as Hero... by just solving one case! I can suspend you right away! And no one can stop me! Hello! - Sir! Sir! He is here Sir. Nothing as such Sir! Okay sir! As you say Sir. I am here with preparation! Look! When I came here I thought only you are my problem... And after coming here... have realized there is even more! That is why... It is better if we mind our own business! Mahatma Gandhi has told this in 1950 itself... Policemen are paid very less! If possible work on this. Sir! I appreciate your memory Sir... You are too good Sir. Reddy! - Sir! Gandhi was died before 1950! - Sir! How come he did not notice it? I think his general knowledge is poor! - Oh! One more doubt sir... You could have said it by yourself... Why did you involve Gandhi Sir? It is better if we say good words in the name of great people... If not...Who will listen to us? It makes sense Sir... I have learned a lot Sir! Feel like drinking something cool Sir. – Let us go! Did you warn my father through D.G.P.? Did he tell you that? - Did you do it or not? Does he tell everything at home like a small girl? Nothing as such! He said it to my mother & she told me. Why do not you support me? Like how your mother does to your father! That is why I did not hit you yet! You say that you like me... & not my father... What logic is this? Darling! Everybody hates white people, & yet we use roads made by them... And people like your father sit in the buildings made by them... Here products are more important than persons! What are you so pride for? Instead... You may ask what I love you for! Who asked her to do all this non- sense? - Brother Silk! The girl have asked you to come upstairs. But why will she ask me to come upstairs? - Brother! Brother! The girl donated your theatre to some one! Oh my goodness! Whose theatre did she give to whom? Is it the time to ask all these? Just go! Unnecessarily I am dependent on you! - How come she does this? - Now there is nothing left with you! Do you think that is your father is theatre? How come you are here Mr. Silk? He might have told you everything! I would like to release my movies as well. Is it your father is property to do anything? Do one thing... put an AC as well & sleep! What is this? Do not he know anything apart from this? Sir! I have completed collecting funds. Ask everyone to get inside once! Sir! In India.. Currency is given more value than Gandhi is words. That is why I did this. This is people is money, Here people do not like us & our work too! There is just one thing... Fear! Even now they got the money out of fear. If possible let is remove the fear in them. Does anyone has any doubts? Sir! You are wealthy too... You could have done it by yourself... Why collecting money from people? Just by giving 100 Rs for Ganesh Chaturthi we ask when, where and how? We too know that nothing happens with our 100 Rs. But we feel that as our right People assume we do everything by ourselves... & if we take money from them... They will keep an eye on us. From today no one is going to stretch hands for money! No single illegal activity should take place! From now every individual salary is 50000 Rs! Blast on from now! Yes sir! Bro, he is closing down our belt shop Bro in law, brother is been arrested Kolleru is a very sensitive area. High command is arriving tomorrow from Delhi. No incidents should take place tomorrow at any cost Rana that is your area. You must look after it. Careful. Who is that? What bro, sitting and drinking alone? Sit. Why have you arrested my brother? Bro, Is this personal or professional time? Personal. Then, do not speak about professional matters. I am tired out with duties of the entire week. Still, why did you leave him free like that? Why did not you get him married? Where man? No time for family being busy in public service. That is it, it seems your concentration has become more on public. Better to bring it down. Not one or two, I am habituated for the past 30 years I cannot stop doing it... Public service! Your Public service is your wish. Why I came here was, there is some important meeting for you tomorrow. It seems someone is here from high command, I am not doing my duty tomorrow. I will not let anyone else also do. Still why is that SP fellow saying me bro? Should he not tell? Should say to animals, should ask humans and request... people like me! He should know that. Why to talk with him bro, rather kill him! Kill me! Brother! Kill me! Brother! Kill me! You just say yes bro! Kill me! Just say yes bro! They are drunk, leave it. I will leave, your brother. Good! Ranapratap Jaidev, public servant! Krishna, be careful. By whose name is this land so happy and fish jump in joy from ponds? He is the brother of Damu, cool going, obedient Durga Prasad. He is reaching the stage in some time. Let us welcome him heartily with our claps. Grandpa, lift me up! Damodar Prasad is the great human seeing lady as mom & sister. Giri, ask all to hold garlands and sit quietly. Say will be dead if they open their mouth. Ok brother! Hey, you should shout and that should be heard to the one arriving. That should be only “hail Durga Prasad” If someone shouts anything else about your lives... You know what happened to those already shouted throats. How is the village sir? It is shining like the fresh fish coming in sir. Ministry this time is confirmed, right sir? When it is so peaceful, who else would get than you sir? Looks like CRPF is in as you said no to duty sir. Sir, tea! If anyone opens their mouth, will kill them. Go! If anyone opens their mouth, will not go back home. Hey old man, go and sit. Hey! It is so here, we hit when mistake happens. It is same at my place, we hit even without mistake. Hey! Giri! Hail Praja Party! Hail Praja Party! Hail Praja Party! Hail Praja Party! Hail Praja Party! Hail Praja Party! Hail Praja Party! Hail would be Minister Durga Prasad! Hail would be Minister Durga Prasad! Hail would be Minister Durga Prasad! Charge! Where is the unsolved issue? What is the whirl wind saying? Where is the unsolved issue? What is the whirl wind saying? Who breaks the shackles unseen? What even if the eyes like glass, open? Who breaks the shackles unseen? What even if the eyes like glass, open? Brother! What is he saying? Stop bro. What is he saying? You stop bro. What is he saying? Will he give or not? Stop bro. Will he give or not? We shall talk. My village is great... It lives away from self-respect and close to insults... Every time I see it, I remember just one thing... Why God gives hunger to all does not give food to all? When god can teach us to live... But has not given dare to all? When not heard by crying and shouting, every time reminded to be alive... All letters gave one name, Asuragana Durga Prasad. Will stamp down if asked, will kill when shouted... No proofs for the crimes in the presence of Kolleru. There is one thing above all these truths, lies and proofs... Freedom! As my village does not have it, I named my daughter so. At bright sunny day, the name I have been listening to... The name that threatened the village, I met him. You are trying to know more than required about me. My work is to know. Still whales do not fall to the fishing nets. You may threaten humans, but not the letters. Lives should not be written on papers. Go! I understood then that human with greed is more dangerous than hungry animal. Same night, in the witness of Gandhi my complaint given... was torn. Many insults after that, most unforgettable from it was when Damu slapped me in front of my six year old daughter... I said we are playing! Every dad wishes to show up great to their children. May be this is why... I could not tell my daughter. Why to fight with them, my son! How many days more like this dad? What how many days? It is till the day we live. He is writing and we are just seeing! Gandhi wet in sweat used to come home every now and then.. How much did he pay dad? It is better we take what they give. They should pay as much we demand, right? You were given education, not to better our lives... It is for at least you to live happily. Who stands blocking our lives dad? Even I was as daring as you in my childhood... But for that to melt down, it took so much age... Police had come for you, go once to the station. Go! The night journalist went to station... Will it be a risk? It is a journalist, will have to shut many voices. What shall we do? One happens for 5 and the other for 10. But the work would be done. You have the dare to throw stone, but why are you not giving complaint? When I saw him, I remembered my son... After they started hitting, his daughter came to my mind... I can live without freedom but not without this kid. I ca not! The silence of dumb is one type and that of the poor is different type Dumb cannot say as he cannot, but the poor cannot even knowing it all. What is he, when someone hit before his kid says he is playing? I am not feeling good, Reddy! He is Silk, right? Yes sir! Call him. Hey! Come here. No, I am caught to bro. Catch the cycle. Come here! Why have you called bro? What your people do is wrong! Is not it? May be bro! What may be? Do not you know? I may be knowing bro. Do you know or not? Bro, let me say frankly. Even my bro is about to become Minister. My uncle is CM, so what? Reddy! Sorry sir. If you do extras, Ambulance would come even here Bro, mother promise. My bro is a big rascal. I will change into approver bro. I will support you. Leave me. Go! Thank you bro. Carry on! Meet me once tomorrow Okay. Daddy, I like this guy. I will not run away with him. I know that you both have small issues. Sit and speak, problems will be solved. I will wait outside. Please manage! Uncle! Should be ashamed to call me so. BP tablet! Look, do not disturb me for five minutes. Okay. You silly! Hi, thought you forgot me. Why have you called me? I am tensed. Did you get “F“ grade in exams? Just joking! I informed dad about marriage. Hey! I would have come in pink shirt, if you would informed before. Do not know, I am very much tensed. I will take care, I will take care. Will you go in and manage? Go, go Is it ok? Super, super go! Thank you! I am friend of Megha, uncle! Why is he here? Uncle looks very strong. I just saw in TV yesterday that they call this pack, uncle! Many waste fellows have tried uncle for stopping this. But as me and Megha are strong, this has come till here. Yes uncle, Gavaskar has done it all. Did you know now who the idiot is and who Gavaskar is! Megha told me that you get irritated for everything... But you look very silent like Buddha on the tank bund Why does he not utter a word? What now, will you say ok for marriage or not? Tell uncle. Is it my mistake for not telling in advance? Why do you be so like a rock, say uncle, say! What telling, you bloody? Megha! Are you the pimp between these two? Megha! Are you the pimp, idiot? Daddy please! Donkey, stupid! Daddy, Gavaskar is like a brother to me. You hit me uncle, this is better! What now, are you getting us married or not? Uncle, I had anger on you, But now I have love on your daughter too... I will take good care uncle. He will take good care dad. He will really take good care uncle Hey, back. Uncle is like father, right? Look baby, I agree for this marriage as I like you. But, one condition... I will not wash his feet Why uncle, are we not Hindus? Come here... We too will have egos! You look cute like the smile of Goddess Sita He is Rama without Laxman and is your couple Like a cute babe and like my eye ball My age is remembered you like a girl in full moon Somehow, you receive the love from him I am the man one in thousands Receive the result of your good from last births Pray to feet and become his lady Now is the marriage and the joy today Now is the marriage and the joy today Everlasting company welcomes you Now is the marriage and the joy today Star from sky has shined before me today Will the age not stay calm? It is a joy, joy and joy Beauty sharing her charm is the sweet of your talks Will not be calm then, it is a joy, joy and joy By swinging in your lap, nothing like alone than this It is a joy looking you through my eyes Now is the marriage and the joy today That is why we drink Red label daily! Hey they drink in the morning and we drink at night. What you drink is a cheap brand, right bro. Do I drink cheap brand? Shut up and eat! You cheap idiot! Even life has become worst like the food at home. My girlfriend is settled to that SI... He and SP are one now. All happened so suddenly. So sad! No problem if they both become one. Problem is only when someone with us mixes with them! Why do you speak so? You speak as you wish... Bro, you are a politician. AP is divided. One is Telangana and the other is Seemandhra. Will those two come along again? How will we mix up again? Hello! Is silk there? Uncle, call for you. I am talking an important matter here. Ask who he is and what the matter is? He is asking to enquire who and what. Nothing, he said to become approver. Ask when and where? It seems you said to become approver to someone... He is asking when and where... He said not to fear watching elder and younger bros. He would confirmedly kill. Bloody! You and your family. Why does he speak so? He is tall, he is short and you are black. Have I ever asked about cross connections of your family? You are speaking about my family. Bloody fools! Looks like he felt bad. Brother! MP Durga Prasad with the hopes of Ministry is again into depression. Reason known is that high command is not happy about MP. High command took the riot in front of their representative recently very seriously. Information is that ministry is lost as he could not control the mob. Where is grandpa? Do not know. Hey, where is the old man? Where is the grandpa! Baby Sir, do not do anything to my baby... I catch your feet sir, please Two minutes! We are playing baby Are you playing? Be careful with the baby Oh God! What is happened? Madame! You go inside Madame I need that guy! Sorry sir! Sorry sir! I still have an old scooter sir! How long is it been that I am kidnapped? One hour! How long is it from there to the house of your bro in law? Half an hour. Di not you still understand? Who kidnapped whom? We are booked man! Sorry boss, late by 30 minutes! God promise bro, I am pissing inside bro! Someone please talk bro. Bro, someone please talk bro! Say yes bro, I will kill that fellow! I understood. Shall we sit and speak for 5 minutes? Why have you actually come? That SP caught my collar. That is why I came. For catching the collar? Why are you on me leaving him then? Thought of leaving, but you stopped me. When did I stop you? I asked you to leave, right? I did not like that. That is why I am still here. Why did you come after getting old? That is why I am still speaking. Else, I would not have given even this time. Hey, you have enough, why are you mad about people. That is what I am saying. You and I have money. Why all this still? Who wants money? Even unknown stands up when we walk, I need that! The opposite leaves calm even when we do wrong, I need that! Entire village fears of thinking what I do, I need that! Need to snatch for that, & I am snatching! What do you know about Kolleru? I do not anything about Kolleru. A six year baby asked me once. Where her father is was her question... An old lady has asked where her husband was... An old man has asked where justice is? And I have no answers! It is not this ground you are snatching, it is the people. He too has to mix in this ground someday, right? No problem if he goes by himself, whereas you are sending them! That is the rule of the jungle! There are people killing fishes & still living, Why do not you oppose them? Similarly I am killing people and living, & no one must oppose me... I have not cried even when my brother was dead, & I am angry now... You are sitting in front of me and speaking like this. Who are you? Are you born or brought up here? Why do not you have fear of me? Why should I? Why should a human fear of another human? You should, it is not human opposite to you. It is Asuragana Durga Prasad. You idiot! Yes, yes! I am a young idiot. I did not know what life is till I came here. I knew only after I came here. Do you know how it feels when the dream of 30 years is gone? You know how it feels when you drive away the fear I grew here? You know how it feels when you want to give away what I snatched? I have no problem if you snatch 1000 more acres. You should let human live... like a human! At least let him live on his own. But you are snatching that! What rules in snatching? But why should you snatch? Because there are more lame fellows here, daring like you are less and stronger like me is only me! Will you not change? No. Because history always remembers only the evil like me. Two evils should not be here. Sir, what shall we do with him? I gave word to an old lady to do justice. Declare as an unidentified body. Ok sir! I have not said to anyone that you hit me. You too do not reveal it. People started believing us just now! Do not let it go! Reddy, no energy. Take out the vehicle. Ready sir!
