Sure, honey, I never refuse the few requests I get. My mom and dad took me to see your show on Broadway last year. I think you're the greatest dancer in the world. It's you and me against Fred Astaire. [chuckles] [instrumental music] May I cut in? Certainly. Aren't we supposed to dance? Oh, I'd love to but, uh, unfortunately I don't know how. - You don't know how? - No. Then why did you cut in? Well, uh, I thought we might sit this one out. - That I know how. - I'll teach you to dance. I'm a very poor pupil. Follow me. Right foot back. One... two... three... four. Both: One... two... Oh! Ouch. Four. Shall we try it again? Only this year they're doing it without the ouch. - Oh. - Ah-ha. Ooh, my poor feet. I'm afraid you'll never learn. It's just as well. I wanted to get a little better acquainted anyway. Such a short boat ride. What? Five days? I wasted four and a half of them before I met you. How do you do? My name is Tom Farnham. How do you do? I'm Melinda Howard. Well, that's over. Now, what do you say we throw caution to the winds? Please, let's not make up four and a half days in four seconds. Okay, I'll wait. What's another minute or two? The ship's paper says that you're paying a quick visit to New York after several years' absence. Oh, really? Did it also give my age and say that I don't like men who operate so fast? Alright, alright. You win. After that number I saw you do I'd say you're in show business. I am, in a way. I've been touring the provinces with a small theatrical company. - Oh? - Mm-hm. Saved a little money and decided to come to America and surprise my mother. They always have a mother. Gosh, I haven't seen her in years. You've probably heard of her, Jessica Howard? She's very famous on Broadway. - On Broadway, now? - Yeah, oh. She's starring in a musical. You'll have to excuse me. I don't know much about show business. Oh, what do you do, Mr. Farnham? Oh, I spend most of my time trying to get girls to call me Tom. Um, if you'll excuse me I just remembered that I have some packing to do. I'll help you. Oh, no, thank you, I'll manage. What's the matter, don't you trust me? What's this for? There's a message on that for you from the women of the world. Goodnight, Mr. Farnham. Tom: "In God we trust." Well, it wasn't a total loss. [instrumental music] [doorbell buzzing] Sorry to disturb you, Diamond Jim but that's the front door. Front door, living room, master bedroom, library. This is like living in a pinball machine. Can't even eat around here. Why did I ever leave show business? - I'll bite, why did you? - Oh! - Yes, miss? - Oh, how do you do? I'm Miss Howard. Would you bring in my luggage please? - I'll take this one. - I beg your pardon? And have mother come downstairs, but don't say who's here. I'm sorry, miss, this is the residence of Adolph Hubbell and he has no children that anyone's been able to trace. What's he doing in my mother's house? Are you sure you have the right address? This is 485 Beekman place, isn't it? Hasn't been changed. That's the address on every letter that mother sends me. Oh, no. - You're not Melinda Howard? - Yes. But it couldn't be, you're in England and you're gonna stay over there, aren't you? I'm here. Follow me. Where are we going? You should have written your mother you were coming. I just wanted to surprise her. You'll surprise her alright. You see, she's rented the house to Adolph Hubbell. You know, Hubbell Breweries. Just while she's on tour. On tour? Don't tell me she's out of town. I believe she's due in New York in a day or so for a conference with the producers. I'll see if I can locate her for you. Oh, but if she isn't here, where am I going to stay? I haven't any money. - No money? - Unh-unh. Welcome to the club! Am I intruding? Oh, Gloria, this is Miss Howard. You know, Jessica's daughter? Uh, Miss Davis, the lucky girl that's going to marry me. - Well, how do you do? - Hello. Be with you in a minute, Gloria. This way please. Here's a charming guest room if you don't mind staying in the servants' wing. Oh, I don't mind at all. It certainly is nice of you to go to all this trouble. This ought to fix you up temporarily. And don't worry about your mother. I'll see that she gets here. Why shouldn't she? Hm? Oh, that's right. Why shouldn't she? I've been one of your mother's most ardent admirers for years. You see, I, uh, I used to be in show business... myself. Oh, really? Then why are you doing this? Oh, I don't know, it was just a mad impulsive desire to keep from starving.

Not seeing the customers. - Jessica. - Hello, Lefty. Baby, you're singing better than ever. You don't have to lie to me, Lefty. We're not on the same bill anymore. And this isn't exactly the palace either. What'll you have? Give me a Bromo with a chaser. One olive or two? Did you mail that check to the kid yesterday? Yeah, but I could've saved you a stamp. She's here. Here? In New York? You didn't bring her down? Of course not. She's at the house. The house she thinks you own. You've got to send her back. How do we do it, with mirrors? She's come to see you, you know? It's been a long time. I draw a blank, I don't know where to go from here. There's only one way, I told her you were on the road. Tomorrow you come into town for one day. You have a big reunion and you go back on the road. And where do we hold this big reunion? In a telephone booth? I've arranged that too. Tomorrow the Hubbell's are throwing one of their parties. They've invited half of Broadway for entertainment. You come back and steal the show. If I can get in. There's your invitation. I made out the guest list. No, Lefty, I couldn't face her. - I... She'd know, she... - How's she gonna know? - Who's gonna tell her? - Look at me. Greenwich village Gertie. It'll be like the old days. Everybody in town will be there. Lights, music... and Jessica Howard. You'll be a smash. You really think I could get away with it? If Jessica Howard can't play Jessica Howard who can? Alright, Lefty, I'll try. - 9 o'clock? - Sure, sure. - But promise me one thing... - Not a drop. Everything's going to be alright. Incidentally, the kid's a knockout... like her mother. Hit me again, Joe. It's homecoming day. Hi. Hello. Do you think it'd be alright if I go upstairs and take a look around? Oh, I don't know about that. My mother has written and told me so much about this place, I'd like to see it. Oh, I guess it'll be alright. Mr. and Mrs. Hubbell are asleep by now. - Right up those stairs. - Thanks. Oh, listen, while you're staying here try to keep away from Mrs. Hubbell if you can, huh? Thanks for the tip. Oh, this house is so wonderful. Mother must be doing alright, huh? Oh, yes, she's really flying. [instrumental music] [dramatic music] [instrumental music] [music continues] [screaming] Oh, I'm so sorry! I... I thought you were asleep. Who... who are you? What are you doing here? Twisting around in my living room? I'm Miss Howard. Miss Howard, this means something? Oh, I hope I didn't disturb you but I just wanted to sort of have a look around the house. Isn't that a beautiful painting? "Painting?" Madam, this is not a museum! People don't come in off the streets! Don't do that. It's liable to leave a ring. Do you realize how much a table like this costs? Uh-huh, you... you are in the furniture business now? Well, I don't think that you should take advantage of the fact that my mother's out of town and abuse her furnishings. I abuse what I want! Please, Mr. Hubbell, don't spill any more beer on the rug! 'How would you like it if this were your house?' Adolph: Right now I wouldn't like it. What is this? Better I get the police. Something wrong, Mr. Hubbell? Yes, this girl, she comes in my house she dances around in circles. She won't let me drip beer on my own rug. I sneak down to get away from Mrs. Hubbell and what do I get? Another Mrs. Hubbell! Leave everything to me. Come with me. I have good news for you about your mother. - Oh, you do? - Wait for me downstairs. I'll explain everything to Mr. Hubbell. What's going on in my own house? Who is she? Mr. Hubbell, do you remember many years ago you backed a Broadway show, "Pretty Lady?" Of course. Remember the star? Yeah, J... Jessica Howard. How could I forget? A wonderful woman. Too bad what happened to her. This girl is Jessica Howard's daughter. What? She doesn't know about her mother. And we want to keep it from her. Will you help us? Anything. Anything I can do. Thank you, sir. Sorry, I keep thinking it's my house. [chuckles] [instrumental music] [applauding] Ladies and gentlemen.

This way I throw two stones at one bird. [chuckling] There's Ferndel now. Ladies and gentlemen your attention, please. Here he is, my boy Tom Farnham with the number that's going to be the big hit of my new show. Come on out here, Tom. Get going. [applauding] Tom: Thank you. Thank you.

What will your wife think? You taking a blonde and giving her a room in your home? You mean, you... you think she will think that I... Thank you, that's the nicest thing anyone has said to me in 15 years. Oh, thank you. [indistinct chatter] Oh, Miss Howard, I have some money for you. Here's a nickel. You owe me four insults. You, uh, picked up dancing pretty quickly for a beginner, didn't you? Oh, I'm ready for more lessons anytime. [chuckles] What are you doing here anyway? I never thought I'd see you again. It's a small, uncomfortable world, isn't it? I can see I've got a lot of explaining to do. That was my shipboard treatment you got the other day. On land, I'm really not a bad guy. Tell me, how are you underwater? Ouch! Look. Would you give me a little time to redeem myself? Anna: Oh, Tom. Right now I've got to butter up Hubbell's wife. But I'll be back with you in two seconds. Oh, you can take longer than that. Here, Tom, I think you earned this. Thank you, Mrs. Hubbell. Uh, did you like my little number? Oh, I think it'll be wonderful in a show my husband doesn't have to back. Oh-ho, he hasn't done too badly in show business. He's lost everything, but his accent. Well, now, if you'll excuse me, I... Uh, better wait. I may call on you to rescue my husband from Ferndel. No, no, no, no, not even a nickel does my wife let me put in another Broadway show. But Adolph I counted on you for 50,000. I'm already in rehearsal. [chuckles] In rehearsal already. And who picked the chorus girls? You. Who stages the numbers? You. Who picks the music? You. And who pays the bills? Me. But this is a modern Broadway show. I'd like to have you help but your taste in music and girls is a little old-fashioned. So my money's old-fashioned too. It won't go out of the house. Remember us, Mr. Ferndel? - Davis and Mack? - Oh, sure, sure. We're just working here as maid-butler for laughs. Not to mention food, lodging and clothing. Oh-oh, but the theater's our first love. You give us a spot in your new show and I'll turn in my dickey. There isn't gonna be any new show. My angel just flew the coop. Freeloader. [instrumental music] - Fine, Tom. Very, very good. - Thank you. How much did you go for this time? Not a cent. I kept my promise to you. Sure. Anna, I wonder, do you mind if I ask something to you? - What? - You know the music. The excitement, I'm getting too old for it. Every bone in my head aches. Always too old. Always something aches. I just thought if I could go upstairs slip away without anyone noticing. That's just to get out of dancing with me. Anna.. Alright, go upstairs to your hot water bottle but I stay. Uh, but, Mr. Hubbell, how can you sneak away? There's a dozen people around here who want something from you. I... I man... manage it. Don't worry. You sure you won't mind staying downstairs a little longer and carrying on for me, Anna? Not a bit. I'll dance with Tom. Won't I, Tom? Well, I... I... I'd be glad to, Mrs. Hubbell, but... Thank you. It helps me out. I won't forget it. Goodnight, Anna. If anybody asks for me tell them I'm enjoying poor health. Well, shall we give it a tussle? [instrumental music] Uh, uh, Mr. Hubbell, excuse me. Has my mother arrived yet? Don't worry, she will come. Everything I have taken care of. - Ah. - Mm-hm. What are, what are you doing here all alone? Oh, I'm, I'm trying to avoid a dancing lesson. What's the matter? You don't like the teacher? Well, I haven't made up my mind yet. A pity I am too old or I would dance with you. - You would? - Mm-hm. Oh, well, you know the old saying. "The young in heart never grow old." Is that so? And I think you're one of the young in heart. Thank you. May I have this dance, please? - Me? - Oh, this is a nice waltz. Alright, but too much you shouldn't expect. My heart is young, but my feet are ready to retire. [both chuckling] - Shall we, then? - Right now? Uh, would you rather wait for the next one? Oh, no, no, no. By that time, even older I will be. [instrumental music] Come on, you can do it. It's easy. See? You dance beautifully. [chuckles] Thank you. Whoop. Ha-ha-ha! I'm afraid I'm not as lightheaded as I used to be. Oh.. Look, there's Adolph. [music continues] And he told me that he had a headache. Getting a little tired? No, it's a little crowded. Let's get closer to where the crowd ain't. Who is that girl? Look, I'm gonna stop dancing. One Hubbell creating a spectacle is enough. Perhaps, I should cut in. Before he knocks himself out. - Yes, go on. - Excuse me. [music continues] Why, Tom. What a surprise! For years I haven't seen you. You know, Miss, uh, uh... - Howard. Melinda Howard. - Miss Howard. - How do you do, Miss Howard? - How do you do? Excuse me, I see somebody makes motions to me. Pardon me. - May I? - I'm charmed. [music continues] Who is that girl, and why did you come back here to dance with her? You know... As I was going out, I... I... I bumped into George... George Gubbins. Yes. You... you often hear me speak of him. Never. And what has that got to do with it? Uh, this his daughter, you know? Poor child. Men don't seem to like her. He asked me to talk to her about it. Men seem to like her now. Yes, I... I... I talked to her. [sighs] Shee... [telephone ringing] Three O'Clock Club. Oh, hello, Lefty. Who? Jessie? No. No, they poured her out of here around 2 o'clock this morning. What's happened to her? The usual. Screaming meemies. She was breakin' up the joint. I'll come down right away. But she's not here. They took her away. Same place. It's tough. [instrumental music] Lefty, any news from her mother? She's not going to make it. Why? What happened? She's drinking again. They've taken her to a hospital. I better get down and see if she's alright. Go, go, I pay all the bills. Go. Thank you, boss. Mr. Hubbell, what time is it, please? The time. Who cares what time? But mother was supposed to be here at 9 o'clock and I... Why doesn't everybody have fun? Tom, sing another song. Give the party a shot in the head. Please, no more solos. I'm tied up for the evening. - D... do, do something together. - What? - Even better it will be. - Oh, Mr. Hubbell... What do you say, teacher? Oh, look, I'll just be in your way. And I'll be in your way, we'll have a wonderful time falling all over each other. Come on, you start it.

What are you doing here? Everybody goes home an hour ago. Oh, Mr. Hubbell, I'm worried. Your mother? Do you think something happened to the train? I promise you, to the train nothing happened. Now, please, go to bed. Lefty, where have you been? Have you heard anything? I just talked to your mother on the phone. Oh, you did? Where is she? I don't know how to break this to you but she's not coming home right away. She's not coming home? - Why not? - Well, you know how it is. The show's a hit and if they had to take her out of it it'd kill the business. She's a star, you know. But did you tell her that I was here? Of course not. You wanted to surprise her, didn't you? - Oh, that's right. - Easy it is to understand. Maybe you go back to England. When her, when her show finishes she will come to see you, no? I'll pack your bags in the morning. Lefty, I'm not going. I'm gonna stay right here and wait for her. Even if it takes months. Months? You know how long is months? Oh, I know I was foolish coming so unexpectedly but now that I'm here, I can't go until I see her. M... months? M... maybe... Maybe better you should go to a, to a hotel and wait. Oh, Mr. Hubbell, if you don't mind I'd much rather stay here. You have so many empty rooms in the house and everything that... Uh, wouldn't it be kind of foolish if I went to a hotel? Mm-hm. Foolish, foolish... So foolish, I don't know why you even brought it up, foolish. - Thank you, Mr. Hubbell. - Yeah. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Anna: Adolph, who's downstairs? No, no, no, no. Nobody is downstairs. N... nobody. Months. [groans] Shee! Just look at these grocery bills. And most of them are for food for the servants. They... they have to eat. That butler and maid you hired eat enough for three people. No, it's only two. Two actors eat the same as three people. Besides, they're out of the house most of the time. They... they're trying to go back to the theater. Well, I hope they get back soon. Anyway, the bills have got to come down or they go out. Tell 'em. - You rang? - You heard? [door slams] We can't cut down, Mr. Hubbell. You wouldn't want us to deprive Melinda of anything. Oh, no, no, no. But... but what can we do? Well, we could cut down on your dinners. Alright, if I get hungry I'll come down and eat with you. Maybe I have been spending too much money on food but it's just to keep Melinda's spirits up. She's in pretty bad shape. Came all the way to this country. Her mother won't see her. She's broke. Had to pawn her coat today. We have to take care of that. And she cries all the time when nobody's looking. It's terrible. Terrible. Mr. Hubbell you've got a chance to do something wonderful. Cheer her up. Take her to dinner. To a show. It'll bring the sunshine to her lips... and the rosebuds to her cheeks. Gee, I should be on the dramatic stage instead of vaudeville. B... b... but h... how can I take her out? I'm married. Can you think of a better reason? No, I couldn't. My wife. No. Ferndel was right. What do you know about Ferndel? I heard what he told you at the party. That you're too old-fashioned. You've no eye for beautiful women. He shouldn't judge me by my wife. But what would he think if he saw you with Melinda tonight alone, having dinner? Wouldn't you feel young again? I wouldn't be old-fashioned then, huh? Why, you may have found the leading lady for his new show right under his nose. Already I feel younger. All... But Melinda, y... you think she would come to dinner with me? Why, of course, she knows you're only trying to help her. She's worried and alone. Why, you'd be doing her a good turn. Tonight I'll do my good deed. Wasn't it nice of Mr. Hubbell to ask me to dinner? You remember one thing, dearie, don't let him get any ideas. What? Why, he's like a father to me. Take it from a girl who's been out with a lot of fathers in her time. Lead with your left. Here you are, sir. Every night he has to go to his club for pinochle. No, but tonight I got the feeling I'm going to hold the best hand in years. - Goodnight, darling. - Goodnight. Don't wait up for me. The game may go on for hours. - Goodnight, Mr. Hubbell. - Goodnight. [instrumental music] [whistling] Oh, good evening, Mr. Hubbell. Good evening, Mr. Mack. I... is she ready? - All ready, Mr. Hubbell? - Come on, then. We go stepping. Oh, forgot my hat. Already I feel 20 years younger. Anna: Adolph? I feel 20 years older. What are you doing here? I thought you were gonna play pinochle. - I... I... - Uh... Mr. Hubbell dropped in to, uh... to give us a lecture on our extravagance. And he had a perfect right to mention it to us. Our food bill has been much too high. - Much-much high. - We'll cut down some place. I didn't think Mr. Hubbell was gonna speak to you about it. That's the reason I came downstairs. Thank you, darling. Run along and have a good game. I... I will. I will. Don't wait up for me. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. [door closes] [rattling] What's the matter with that door? - It was stuck. - Oh. Didn't I hear Mrs. Hubbell down here? - Big as life. - Oh, is she coming with us? No, h... headache she has. Too bad. [chuckles] Come. Well, have fun. Don't worry. [indistinct chatter] [instrumental music] Sidney, the theater's dying. Today, the angels aren't happy just to lose their money, they wanna produce their flops too. All of which means Hubbell didn't stand still, huh? He wanted to help with the casting. And the old boy doesn't know a pretty girl from a Guernsey cow. Hey, don't look now, but he just walked in with the pride of the dairy. [music continues] Two, Mr. Hubbell? You said it, kiddo. Yes, sir. [humming] That girl was at his party. She's a pretty good performer. - Or she runs a little hat shop. - Oh, you don't think that... Why don't you offer her a part in your show and see how quickly he pulls out his checkbook? A drink before dinner? Oh, not for me, thank you. Uh, how about you, Mr. Hubbell? Your usual beer? Beer? Where you been living, bub? In a cave? [indistinct chatter] A double zombie. - For you? - What's the matter? You want to see my driver's license? I tell your fortune. What... Good evening, Adolph. Hello, kid. How is tricks, huh? Uh, haven't I seen your charming companion somewhere? Mm-hm, at the party the other night, Mr. Ferndel. Mm-hm. She is my discovery. I pick pretty good for an old-fashioned Joe, huh? My compliments. She also has a good voice. - Oh, thank you. - Naturally. So I am putting her into a show. Mr. Hubbell, you didn't tell me! He's full of surprises tonight. To Adolph Hubbell, the star-maker. Are you trying to run me off the street, Adolph? Why can't we get together on my new show? I'm sure we can find something very interesting in it for this young lady. Oh, well... Everyone seems to have my future pretty well settled. I don't know. We see about backing your show maybe. How much I write in my checkbook depends on how much I got to say. Mr. Hubbell, you are producing the show. Hm-mm. I'll give you the check tomorrow. All made out and ready for you to sign, Adolph. There... Now, Tom Farnham is going to be at my office at 2:30 tomorrow afternoon to run through some numbers. It'd be a good time for us all to get together. Don't blow on it. After that zombie, you might scorch it. I can pick them, huh? - So can I. - Huh? Well, see you tomorrow, Miss Howard. - Fine. - Good evening. Good evening. I remember, your mother once sung a great song. "Lullaby of Broadway." Oh, that was her favorite. I revive it and let you sing it. ♪ Come on along and listen to ♪ ♪ The lullaby of Broadway ♪ - I got another idea. - What? Tonight I am full of them. We call the show, "Lullaby of Broadway." - Ha! - Hah-la! May I have your order, madam? Oh, I'm so excited, I think I'll just have crackers and milk. And for dessert, she has shrimp cocktail, steak, potatoes, and coffee. - Man 1: And you? - Another double zombie. Yes, sir. [thudding] [laughs] Oh! They're very nice, but $1,500? That is our established price, sir. Then how come the model I see in the window... This-this one, you see. Please, please come down, Mr. Hubbell. No, you are the one who should come down. The price here is only 1,400. Here. Oh. Oh, Mr. Hubbell, are you alright? Would you like some water? Water? A double zombie. That's a nice jacket you're modeling. You got nothing better to do than peek in store windows, what? I'm sure it'll look much nicer on your wife. I'll take it. - This one in the window. - Yes, sir. I'll have it gift-wrapped. I'll come and put the card in it and take it with me. Dummkopf, it isn't for my wife! Don't mind me. I still read "The Bobbsey Twins." It's for a girl who's very lonely in New York. I want her to know she has a friend. No better way to win friends and influence girls. Of course, you keep it under your hat. I wouldn't want it to drip out. My lips are sealed. And now, if you have to be at Ferndel's office by 2:30, please don't let me detour you. Nah. [piano music] Hello, doll. Who's inside? Somebody trying out? Mr. Hubbell has a little surprise for you. - For me? - Take a look. [music continues] [music continues] Surprise! Yes, surprise. But the sock is on the other shoe. What's all this about? I'm giving her a part in "Lullaby of Broadway." - Oh, that's great! - Oh, that's wonderful. Only a handful of rehearsals she has and she sings. "Somebody Loves Me" like nobody in the world. I'd like to hear it. Come on, let's do it together. - Alright. - Fine. Come. You think you can handle this, buddy? Oh, I think I can. [piano music] ♪ Somebody loves me ♪ ♪ I wonder who ♪ ♪ I wonder who he can be ♪ It's me. It's me. It's me. ♪ Somebody loves me ♪ ♪ I wish I knew ♪ ♪ Who can he be worries me ♪ Your worries are over. ♪ For every girl who passes me ♪ ♪ I shout hey ♪ ♪ Maybe ♪ ♪ You were meant to be my lovin' baby ♪ ♪ Be my lovin' baby ♪ ♪ Somebody loves me ♪ ♪ I wonder who ♪ ♪ Maybe it's ♪ ♪ Baby it's ♪ ♪ Maybe baby that somebody is you ♪ Nah, nah, nah. That's enough. We work pretty good together, huh? Yes. She makes you look good. Come on, Ferndel, I think I run along. - Goodbye, Mr. Hubbell. - So long, Mr. Hubbell. - Bye, Mr. Ferndel. - Keep working. Maybe she teaches you something. [laughs] [instrumental music] [laughing] Well, thanks again for everything, Adolph. I told you I could pick them. You certainly can. Only one mistake I made in my life and I married it. [sighs] Shee. [laughs] What a small, wonderful world. Here we are in a show together. Oh, I can hardly believe it. - Here. - Thank you. Did you really like the way I did the number? Well, honey, in the first part you were great. Oh, good. But, uh... I think we can improve on that kiss. Care to run through it for half an hour or so? Thank you very much, but I wouldn't think of imposing on you, Mr. Farnham. Oh, that's alright. I don't mind a bit. Now, relax. Approach it like a loser. If you're going to fight it you'll have a long downhill struggle. Mr. Farnham. I may have been in Europe but I'm sure that kissing is the same the world over. You'll have to sell me. And stop calling me Mr. Farnham. The name's Tom. Here we go. Close your eyes. Pucker up. Little more. [instrumental music] What'd you say your name was? [door closes] Hi, what are you two doin' up? - Something wrong? - It's Gloria. She's about to tear down something that's big and fine and noble. It's Mr. Hubbell. I think bright eyes here thought of something that's gotten a little out of hand. But how? Mr. Hubbell's been wonderful to me. Why, he gave me a part in the show and, and he's been devoting so much time to me. Why? Well, I guess he thinks I have talent. If he doesn't, then it's just out of friendship. Come here. You don't spend money like this on a friend. It was left here this afternoon. I opened it thinking it was groceries. Oh! I've never seen anything so beautiful. Oh, Melinda! You're such a babe in the woods. "To keep your little shoulders warm when I take you to the Beaux Arts Benefit at the Broadway Theater, Adolph." Oh, isn't that sweet of him? Yes. Imagine him worrying about your little shoulders. [Gloria chuckles] Oh, now, wait a minute. Gloria, you don't really think that Mr. Hubbell and I... At his age? Well, that's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. I don't know about that. Lots of times there's snow on the roof and fire in the cellar. So what? If it gets too hot, you can always turn the damper down. Oh, you couldn't believe that of Mr. Hubbell. I've been around, honey. As long as they've got a pulse beat they're in there pitchin'. I'm ashamed of you. I'm ashamed of both of you. Of course, he shouldn't have sent this expensive coat and I'm returning it. But as far as you thinking what you've thought... Don't link me with Gloria on this. Mentally, we're perfect strangers. Well, I'm gonna show you how wonderful Mr. Hubbell is. He's going to get Mr. Ferndel to give you both a spot in the show. As for that coat... I'll call the furriers myself and have them take it back. [sighs] [door slams] [engine revving] You got a mink coat to return to Thayler's? Shh! Not so loud. Just a minute. Anna: Come here, Mr. Mack, and see what I've got. And I thought Mr. Hubbell forgot my birthday. Just look how small he got it. He thinks I'm still as thin as I used to be. He's so sweet. Every time he sees you he thinks of a young and beautiful girl. Oh, thank you, Mr. Mack. You think it's becoming? You look charming, Mrs. Hubbell. Thank you, Mr. Mack. Ooh, a note. Thank you. All in a day's work. Oh, just listen to this. Tonight Mr. Hubbell's taking me to the Beaux Arts Benefit. Oh! My best evening gown's at the cleaners. You'll have to go and get it. But I've got something to tell Mr. Hubbell. You can tell him later. Go to the cleaners before they close. I need that dress. Wait a minute, buddy. I'm in a hurry. Where's that mink? I couldn't get it back in the box with what was in it. [Adolph humming] - What are you got up for? - Thank you, darling. It's a little small, but your heart was in the right place. The jacket! Heh. Whe... where you, where you get it? H... how? I'm sorry to spoil your surprise but I found it on the table downstairs. - Down... downstairs? - Uh-huh. How... how far downstairs? Downstairs. You did buy it for me, didn't you? Mm-hmm, no... I-I mean, yes. Yes. Shee! Oh, and I love the note you pinned on it. Wha... what note? Inviting me to the Broadway Theater tonight. You did invite me, didn't you? No... Y... yes. Yes! Shee! What's the matter with you? Don't you want to take me? No, I... Sure I, wh... why shouldn't I- Why shouldn't I want to, my darling? I just forget to buy you the corsage, you know. Oh, thank you, darling. You've been thoughtful enough as it is. I'll wait for you downstairs. Tonight everything happened so quick. Your wife, she was like a retriever the way she went after that fur. I left it for one second on the hall table and the next second, she's rooting it out of the box. Worse yet, Melinda wait for me at the Broadway Theater to take her to the benefit. You have to go down and tell her I don't show up. Say I am sick. And it is no lie. But it's our night off. Gloria and me are going bowling. It won't take a minute to stop. Just so everything in the end straighten itself out. But the coat. How do I get the mink coat back from my wife? [instrumental music] No. It would ruin the coat. Mink coat. Mink coat. Shee. - Oh, there she is. - Hi, Melinda. Ah, what are you two doin' here? Thought you were goin' bowling. We are but we've got a message for you. - Ah. - Mr. Hubbell can't meet you. He's sick. Sick? Oh, that's too bad. But we're making it up to you. We're gonna take you along with us. - Well, hello, everybody. - Hi, Tom. Is this a private conversation, or can anybody get in? Barge right in, fella. We're all going bowling. - Wanna make it a foursome? - Thanks very much, Lefty. But I'm on the bill tonight. Aren't you a little overdressed for bowling? Well, I was supposed to go to the theater with Mr. Hubbell and Gloria just told me that he's sick and he can't come. Hubbell? I guess he wanted me to see your act. Oh, well, you can still see it. - I'll take you backstage. - Oh, good. - Do you mind? - Not a bit. You can come too, Gloria. Oh, swell! No, you don't. Alright, Lefty. I understand. Well, why didn't you let me go? What? Are you crazy or something? Who's gonna set up my pins? - Come on. - Oh! [instrumental music] Ladies and gentlemen, recently on my trip abroad I visited a very famous toymaker in the beautiful Italian city of Florence. I discovered he had perfected life-sized mechanical dancing figures of which these toys are replicas. I induced him to bring his dancing dolls to America. So tonight, for the first time in this country the De Mattiazzi's present their dancing mechanical dolls. [instrumental music] [applause] [cranking] [bell rings] Music, maestro, please. [instrumental music] [music continues] [audience laughing] [audience laughing] [music continues] [audience laughing] What are you looking at? There's Mr. Hubbell. Well, he certainly made a quick recovery, didn't he? [music continues] - Tom. - Hm? Tom, look. Isn't that sweet? Isn't what sweet? Mr. Hubbell gave the mink jacket to his wife. Isn't it customary for a husband to give his wife furs? Well, certainly, but in this case he didn't originally buy it for her. I'll say he didn't. Looks a little small, doesn't it? I guess, he forgot we don't wear the same size. "We?" What is this? A sister act? - You're on next, Tom. - Right, Eddie. You're going on with me, we're doing "I Love The Way You Say Goodnight.” We've rehearsed it enough. Now we can show it to the boss. - Are you serious? - Of course. Can't dance in this. Oh, with or without the kiss? I don't know. Your big romance is out front. [scoffs] Silly. [instrumental music] [audience applauding] And now, ladies and gentlemen, a surprise. From the forthcoming show, "Lullaby of Broadway" a preview of one of the new numbers. I hope you like it. Music, professor.

I think we're in. - Melinda. - Yeah? I wanna get something straight. Did he buy that mink coat for you? He wanted to, but naturally I gave it back to him. He's been nice enough already, hasn't he? Have you been seeing him? Of course, we're very good friends. You've been going out with him? Naturally. Why do you ask? How much comes naturally with you? I better take you home. [instrumental music] You live here? Yes. But this is Hubbell's house. - Well, naturally. - Will you stop using that word? Mr. Hubbell was nice enough to let me stay here. That's awfully white of him. Well, it's better than paying for a hotel room. What? Gee, it's a shame we had to leave so early tonight. We could have all gone out together. That would have been cozy. He happened to be with his wife. [chuckles] What difference does that make? It wouldn't have bothered you? Of course not. It would have given me a chance to tell her how wonderful Mr. Hubbell's been to me. You mean... you would have told her? Well, why not? Oh, look, Melinda, I've got to go home while I still know where I live. Hey, aren't you gonna kiss me goodnight? Does everybody? [engine rumbling] Did you have a good time? I should have slapped his face. You had a good time. She'll be right along. Confidentially, how is she? She'll be alright as long as she stays this way. So long, Snow White. Don't think it hasn't been charming. Don't play another return engagement, dearie. I'm gonna take you right to the house, Jessica. What for? We've held the curtain long enough for you. Now it's time for you to make an appearance. In this condition? Not a chance, big boy. I want her to remember me the way I looked the last time she saw me. I was young and pretty. - I was Broadway's darling. - Jessica, listen, honey... I was a headliner, a star next to closing, my name in lights. Nothing was too good for Jessica Howard. Now nothing's too bad. Old, ugly, has-been, once-was. A voice that even the drunks won't listen to. Jessica Howard, the beer singer of Washington Square. Why go back to the club for a while? Just take it easy. Take it easy? I've got to earn a living. I've got a kid to support. I'm dying to see her, Lefty... but she's just got to wait until I straighten myself out. Come on. [clears throat] Hello? We should be very happy to exchange the jacket for a larger size but I, here, can find no record of any coat for Mrs. Adolph Hubbell of 485 Beekman place. Wait a minute, madam. Yes, there was a call to pick up a jacket. Yesterday. From a Miss Melinda Howard of the same address. A Miss Melinda Howard, eh? Are you sure it wasn't a Miss Gubbins? Man 2 on phone: Yes, I'm quite sure. Thank you. You don't know what a help you've been. [whistling] Anna: Adolph? Y... yes, my darling. Where are you going? Uh, to play some pinochle. At this hour? Yeah, we are having a matinee. [whistling] How can you play so much pinochle? Er, I force myself. [humming] [instrumental music] Lefty? Gloria? Oh, I forget. They are at rehearsal. Melinda? Melinda, I take you to rehearsal. [knocking the door] Melinda, it's me, Adolph. [dramatic music] Would you care to play pinochle with me? Mama! Ooh! Stop! [instrumental music] [knock on door] Here's your paper, Mr. Farnham. Thanks, Elmer. [knock on door] - Tom: Melinda. - Come in. Hi. Hello. What does a fella have to do to make you smile? As soon as we finish rehearsing this number I'd like to have a talk with you. Is something wrong? Just remember whatever happens, I'll stick with you. Oh, Miss Howard, how about a statement? Do you deny the allegations, Melinda? How did you and Hubbell meet? Did he give you a diamond bracelet? Is Mr. Hubbell still in town? Wha... I... I don't know what you're talking about. Haven't you seen this? His wife's gonna sue for divorce. Read the story. Please let me read one of these papers. Didn't he give you a charge account at Thayler's? Is it true you call him, "Cuddles?" Mr. Hubbell is a gentleman and I respect him as I would my father. That's all there is to it. [indistinct chatter] Alright, boys. Alright, alright. At the moment, Miss Howard has no statement to make. But if you'll be good sports and wait in the alley for a few minutes, we both may give you one. - Is it a deal? - Okay, Tom. - It's a deal. - It's a promise, Tom. Come on, I'll have a smoke. [instrumental music] Don't worry, sweetheart. Everything's gonna be alright. By tomorrow, they'll forget it. And as for your mother, I'm sure she'll understand. I hope so. I know so. She'll be just as forgiving as I am. "Forgiving?" What you've done is over. We're never gonna mention it again. What do you mean by that remark? The past is over. We've got the future to look forward to. What past are you talking about? I love you, darling. I want you to marry me. You left out four words, didn't you? What words? In spite of everything. You didn't say them, but you meant them. - Oh, now, look, Melinda... - Look, nothing. I suppose I should be grateful to you for offering to make an honest girl of me, but I'm not grateful. I'm just disgusted. Now you get outta here. I never want to see you again. - Melinda, please... - Get outta here! [music continues] [sobbing] Miss Howard? Please, would you let me alone? I'm not gonna bother you. Just give me an exclusive on the story and I'll give you a break. I have nothing more to say. Okay, Miss Howard. I was only trying to... Hey, wait a minute. Are you and Jessica Howard related? She happens to be my mother. Jessica Howard of the Three O'Clock Club? The Three O'Clock Club? What's that? It's a clip joint down in Greenwich Village.

Melinda Howard, pretty blonde actress named as correspondent in the divorce suit against millionaire brewer, Adolph Hubbell, has disappeared. A citywide search has failed to reveal her whereabouts. - Mr. Hubbell. - Oh. Listen, Adolph, what are we going to do about the show? If your wife's divorce suit chased our star out of town I'm coming up there and break her arm in three places. Upstairs, downstairs and in the basement. Don't forget. We got an attic. She's probably hiding somewhere. Alone and hungry. It's tough starving to death, isn't it? It all depends on how much you like food. [telephone ringing] - Hello? - Melinda: Hello, Lefty. Melinda! Lefty, will you do something for me? Where are you? We've hunted high and low for you. Your mother's in town. She's been in town all along at the Three O'Clock Club. I don't have to have a brickhouse fall on me. I know she doesn't care anything about seeing me. Wait, you've got the wrong angle, kiddo. Your mother's had a lot of hard luck. She didn't want you to know she was singing in a joint. Do you think that would've made any difference? Is that the best excuse she can offer for not seeing me? Well, there were other fluid reasons. Lefty, I wanna go home on the Queen Victoria. And it sails this afternoon. Now, I've reserved my ticket. Would you please come down and pay for it? I'll send the money back to you when I get home. Lefty: But what about the show? It opens tonight and they haven't got anybody to replace you. Do you think I could face people after all that's happened? Lefty, will you come down and help me with my boat ticket or won't ya? Okay, if that's the way you want it. Who am I to fight you? In the hands of a woman, I'm so much putty. [foghorn blaring] [indistinct chatter] Everything's all set. You've got a nice outside cabin several feet from the rail. Oh, and here's a bottle of seasick pills in case the walk's too far. Thanks, I'll probably need them. Lefty always takes them when he goes to Newsreel Theater. Why? He gets seasick when he sees the fleet come in. [laughs] Come on. Here we are. Go in and see how you like it. Mother. That's what it says on the birth certificate, honey. I guess that's the only way you could tell. Melinda, don't make it tougher than it is. But I thought you didn't wanna see me. You've got it all wrong. I didn't want you to see me. Why? Just because you had tough luck? That's when I should've been with you. I know it now, dear. If we'd been together all this wouldn't have happened. You've seen the newspapers? - Do you believe it? - Of course not. But you mustn't run away or other people will think it's true. But I can't stay after all those terrible things they've said about me. Look, darling, don't make the same mistake I did. All my life, I was running away trying to hide from unpleasant things. And look at all the unhappiness it's caused. But what about the Hubbell's? Mrs. Hubbell knows the truth now, thanks to Lefty. The little man's had a busy day. I still can't go back. There's another reason. Tom? I never wanna see him again. He's evil-minded. He's conceited, condescending. How do you know about him? Lefty told me. You love Tom, don't you? Oh, yes. Look, it's tough for me to talk like a mother. I need a couple of more rehearsals. But if you love that boy don't lose him. He'll never look at me now. Not after what I've said to him. He'll look at you. And remember this, sweetheart, from here in, it's you and me together. Mother. Lefty: Can't you wait a few minutes? The passengers who have this room are on board. How long do you expect to use this room for $5? [chuckles] Come on, let's grab a taxi and get down to the theater, I hate peace and comfort. You still got the two bucks you were saving for a rainy day? Yeah. Why? Well, break it out, it's pouring. - Come on, Melinda. - Oh! Oh, mother, my bag.
