[funky guitar music] [car engine idling] All right I'm here, Montel, what now? Montel, this is Towers, what now? DAVID MONTEL: Come on in, Phil. I'm waiting inside. [gun shot] [ominous music] Do you like the decor? I did it all myself. [ominous music] [eerie music] Good boy. I see you found the entrance. Well? Don't just stand there. Come and play. SGT. PHIL TOWERS (DREAM VOICE): It's me Towers. Don't go in. It's a trap. DAVID MONTEL: No guts, no glory law man. SGT. PHIL TOWERS (DREAM VOICE): It's a trap. Get out. Save yourself before-- before it's-- before it's too late. DAVID MONTEL: But it is too late. [motorcycle engine revving] [rapid gunfire] [ominous music] Please. Who is he? DAVID MONTEL: See for yourself. [ominous music] Montel, I'm taking you to trial. How can I testify if I'm dead? Ha, ha, ha, ha. Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha. [evil laughing] [ominous music] Ah. Oh, God. Oh. Oh, sonofabitch. [funky guitar music] [birds chirping] [funky guitar music] [birds chirping] [funky guitar music] [birds chirping] Hello? Is anybody here? Yeah, I'm here. Oh, hi sugar. Morning sweetheart. You working by yourself? Yeah, everyone went hunting today. You want some eggs? You bet. I'm about to starve. Coming right up. Thanks. [TRAFFIC NOISE AND BIRDS CHIRPING] [music playing] How are the eggs? Great, I'm already finished. Are you and Alec going hunting today? Yeah, I'm fixing to meet him down at the junk yard. Now, you're not going to disappear for two weeks in the woods are you? You promised to take me dancing tomorrow night. I didn't forget. Date's still on. Good. Now, you come in the kitchen and see what I made for dessert. Dessert? LORI: Yeah, come check it out. [guitar picking] I'm not much in the habit of having dessert after breakfast. [funky guitar music] Maybe you could make an exception. Maybe I could at that. [funky guitar music] Oh, fuck. All work and no play makes for a grumpy boy. Come on, cousin. It's time to go hunting. Yeah, I'm ready. I just got to finish pulling this. Look, this can wait. We're going to go have a few drinks at the bar and then go nail down a couple of bucks. The bar? Jesus, I haven't even had breakfast yet. You know, is there any time of day you don't drink? Yeah, when I'm sleeping. Come on. Besides I already had breakfast and dessert. Dessert? Never mind. Come on, let's go. This can wait. OK. But I do want you to help me get the school bus over here tonight. Damn think again? This town definitely needs a new school bus. Hey, no big deal. Just a brake job. Harvey left the part by the bar. At least it's convenient. I'll tell you what, we'll get drunk, then we'll drive the thing off a bridge. Then they'll have to get new one. You know, keeping that school bus running is a major source of income for me. If you so much as lay a hand on it, I'm going to have to kick your ass. I'm sure you mean that in a figurative way. I'll tell you what, game of pool, best three out of five, if I win, we drive the thing into the river. And if I win, which I will, you buy the beer for the next three months. Hey wait a minute. Oh. [birds chirping] [music playing] [pool cue cracking balls] Yes, that's two in a row. Man, you got lucky. Half those shots were squirrel shots. Yeah, maybe you're right. So I don't suppose you want to play another one, double or nothing. Ha, ha, and don't worry, I'm not feeling lucky anymore. Don't be an asshole. You want another beer? Oh, why not We're buying it with my money. I know. Hey Sarah. Sarah? Damn, that's heavy. Well, baby, if I've told you once, I've told you a thousand times, if you just marry me you wouldn't have to work in this dump. I'd have to work just to pay for your bar tab. Besides what would Lori say? Oh, yeah. I guess you've got a point. Well, maybe won't you give me another round? See what I mean? Hey, why are you guys still in town? I figure you'd be out hunting with the rest of town. JAKE: Well, you know, it's obvious we're trying to beat the rush. We're going to wait about an hour. Oh, did you ever buy a gun or are you still trying to hit something with that bow of yours? Ew, Miss NRA. I'm telling you-- - Ahem. It's the way to go. You ought to try it. You know, a guy could die of thirst around here. Oh, well, here you go. I wouldn't want you dying on me now. If I could die on someone, I'd pick you. Are you ready to play? Yeah, I'm ready to play. Are you? - Later. - Break it up. I'd hate to have to throw cold water on you two. Jesus. Hey, what can I say? Lucky at pool, lucky at love. You know, sometimes you can be real prick. Yeah? That's what makes our friendship so special. Special my ass. [music playing] DETECTIVE WEST: Hello? Hello? Anybody here? SHERIFF: I'm coming. I'm coming. What can I do for ya? Ah, good afternoon, sir. We're looking for the sheriff. Sheriff John J. Roberts in the flesh. DETECTIVE WEST: It's a pleasure to meet you. My name is Detective West. This is Detective Carter. We're here on a witness protection assignment. And we would appreciate your help. SHERIFF: Well sure. But what's it all about? Sir, you understand we have to have your full support. Our witness will be coming through here in the next three or four hours. DETECTIVE WEST: And you must tell no one, absolutely no one, not even your own men. How many men are on duty today? Actually just me. But I don't understand what you want me to do. Ah, sheriff, are there usually more men on duty? Well, there's Emmett. He's gone hunting. The season opened today. It is very important that no one, and I repeat, no one find out about this. Yes, you see we're transferring this witness to Los Angeles under top secret orders. Well, you don't have to worry about me. What's mine is yours. Good. We appreciate that. Yeah, well, thank you very much. SHERIFF: Hey, where you fellas going be in case I have to get a hold of you? Oh, well, ah don't worry, Sheriff. We'll be around. We'll be around. [suspenseful music] SGT. PHIL TOWERS: Want a smoke? DAVID MONTEL: Well, sure why not? When are we going to get something to eat? Soon. Come on. I'm tired of this shit. Well, that's just too bad, isn't it? Fuck. Quit your whining. There's a town about 20 miles ahead. We'll get something there. Whatever happened to three square meals a day? Great. [candy wrapper rattling] Oh, man. You better have a beer. I do. Last one. Looks like we're going to have split it. ALEX: I always have a back up, Jake. JAKE: You're nuts. And you talk about me. Hey, come here, I want to show you my new baby. What is this time? Ah, just wait and see. You ready for this? No, but let's see it anyway. [crows cawing] Jesus Christ. Where's my bow? Here. Today you're using a gun. And this is nothing. I got something else to show you. [birds chirping] Well, what do you think? I think you're nuts, that's what I think. Jesus. Why do you collect all this shit? Because I like it. Look at these. You know what's going to happen when I pump these through that 50 caliber? Yeah, you're probably going to go to jail for about 10 years. Oh, listen Mr. Bow and Arrow, you hunt your way, and I'll hunt mine. Hunt? What are you going to shoot, elephant and buffalo? Don't worry, I'll save a buffalo or a rabbit or two for you. You're not serious. Well, of course I am, however, I'm not dumb. [birds chirping] Hey, let's go hunting. [crows cawing] [eagle screeching] [music playing] Can I help you? Well, you sure can, sweetheart. Well? DETECTIVE WEST: Give us a couple of drafts. Coming right up. What a town, huh? First day of hunting season and everything stops for the day. Jeez, we're-- we're back in the 18th century. Yeah, it's a beautiful thing, isn't it? Besides it makes our lives all that much easier. Here you go. That'll be $1.50. DETECTIVE WEST: You're kidding? You're not from around here are ya? Sweetheart, where I come from, $1.50 doesn't even pay for the ice. Where's that? Nowhere. We travel around a lot. If you say so. [music playing] You keep that. You know, it's hard to believe this town is so quiet. Yeah, it's nice and peaceful around here. If I can get you anything else, just let me know. We sure will. [music playing] Cheers. JAKE: Oh, God. Look at this weather. It doesn't look like we're going to get much hunting done today. Oh, Don't worry about it. It'll clear up. You know how it is. One minute it's bad, and then I'll clear up. It'll be great. I hope so. You know what, as much talk as we do about how this place sucks, I don't think I'd ever leave. Yeah, it does have its moments. Yeah. Remember when we took the Callaghan sisters up to Northridge Point? Oo hoo. - Oh, ho, ho. Remember it? That was a good time. Best shot Alex. Shit, dream on. Yeah, but I remember their brothers. Oh my God. I thought their brothers were going to kill us. Don't even remind me of that. Oh. Those were the days, partying, girls, Budweiser, more girls, more Budweiser, Springsteen. Trojans. Yeah, Trojans, couldn't forget those. How about getting those? You remember that? No, remember we used to try to get good old Pete to buy those for us? Oh, man, Pete. Whatever happened to him? Oh, he's probably still in Hollywood trying to do these low budget movies, you know, trying to be a big movie star. Imagine that. Oh, at least that's one guy that got the hell out of this town. Yeah, I got to give him that. He did have balls. Yeah. Oh, hey, what are those two guys doing over there? Beats me. Let's pull over and ask'em. [birds chirping] How's it going? Oh, just fine. How about you? Not bad. You guys ah all right? Broke down or something? No, no, just enjoying the fine air. Where you guys from? We're just passing through town, thought we'd take a few minutes to come out here and appreciate the countryside. Ah, you're a little off the main road, wouldn't you say? ROBERTSON: Yeah, well, we just figured the scenery would be a little nicer out here. Hm. Well, you figured right. Well, we'll be seeing ya. Y'all have a good day. You too. Thanks for stopping by. Hey, no problem. See ya. [birds chirping] Stupid fucking hicks. I hate this fucking town. Come on, let's get on with it. [birds chirping] How long will this take you? Oh, two or three minutes a line. Good. But just do it so we can get out of the fucking place. [birds chirping] You know, that was strange. What? Well, they just didn't seem like the type to go out of their way for a view. Well, you never know, man. Poor bastards are probably from New York, never seen a tree before. They're used to seeing faggots and pimps. Yeah, but that's my point. You know, guys like that don't do anything that doesn't put money in their pockets. And besides, how the hell would they know where this road is? Yeah, don't you think you're getting a little out of hand, Alex? You want to turn around and make a citizen's arrest or what? ALEX: All right, all right. So I've got an active imagination. It's all those damn detective magazines you've been reading and those guns and shit. Oh. I don't know. You know, something is strange about guys dressed in suits sitting in the middle of nowhere. [loud thumping] Jeez. What the hell now? [birds chirping] Shit, man, I don't believe it. That was a brand new tire. Well, now it's old and fucked up. Great, what should we do? We can't go hunting now. We can either leave the car here and go hunting. Or we can go back and try to catch a ride with those guys. Shit, man we can't go hunting out here. We're not far enough out of town. And the only thing we're going to get here is rabbits and squirrels. And I can't hunt them in my own backyard. Look, dude, then let's leave the car here and go catch a ride with those guys. Oh, great. Come on. We'll lock the car up. Nobody's going to bother our stuff. And we'll go back down there. Ain't nobody going to bother it here. No, in a town this small, we'd know who did it in five minutes. Come on. Damn it. [birds chirping] Five more miles and you get your second meal. What do mean, second meal? That candy bar, that was your first. You're a real asshole, you know that? Yeah, that's what they tell me. Why do you treat me like a piece of shit, hm? Probably cause you are a piece of shit. You know, I make my money in one hour than you make in a year? Not anymore. I could set you up, Phil. Let me go, and you'll never have to work another day in your life. Yeah. You know the way I got it figured, in, prison you oughta make about, oh, $0.18 cents a day. Are you as stupid as you look? Don't you get it? You're nothing. You're more expendable than me. And how do you figure that? Simple. The FBI and DEA want me alive at all costs. And if that cost just happens to be you, well, another cop dies in the line of duty. We4ll, I guess if that's the way it's gotta be, that's the way it's gotta be. My offer still stands. I don't take blood money. I never killed any skunk that didn't damn well deserve to die. I just helped a skunk kill the skunk. What I do is public service. Oh, you're a sick fuck. [traffic noise] [birds chirping] Oh, damn, not the phones again. Hey, hey guys, wait a second. Hey. [ominous music] What's wrong? Did the stupid hicks get lost in their own back yard? You ask too many questions, you know that? [gunshot] Man, what the hell did you do that for? Fun. I hear it's hunting season. I hear it's hunting season, boys. I hope you don't mind if I didn't bring my license. Ain't exactly what you'd call a thriving metropolis. Who cares as long as they've got food. Well, what do you want? Come on. Let's go in and eat. I'm going to ask you one more time, what do you want? I have to take a shit, for Christ's sake. God, you're a pain in the ass. Put up your hands. Damn, that feels good. I'm glad I could make you happy. You got an attitude problem. Tell my therapist about it. [funky guitar music] [dogs barking] Hi. I'm Lori. I'll be your waitress today. Where's your bathroom? Down to the left. You guys are eating, aren't you? Of course we are, sugar. Come on, move it. We'll be back in a minute. [funky guitar music] Do you have to stay in here? It's a little hard to take a shit with an audience. It's was a real thrill for me too. I'll try not to applaud. Oh. Shit. What is it now Montel? There's no goddamned toilet paper in here. Am I going to have to come in there and wipe your ass for you? There's none in here either. I'll go get the waitress to get some. [ominous music] Montel, let's go. Let's go? Get me some toilet paper for Christ's sake. Montel let's go, now. [suspenseful music] Shit, they're gone. Check outside. Move. [suspenseful music] You going somewhere? What the hell are you doing? Hey, you didn't think we'd let'em take you to jail, did ya? DAVID MONTEL: Christ, what took you so long? You ah-- you didn't tell those police anything did ya? What kind of question is that? Of course not. Good, good. That's real good. Can we get the hell outta here now? Well, now I wish we could, but ah-- I'm afraid you're not going with us. [suspenseful music] You kidding me? You sonofabitch. I saved your life once. Oh, sorry. [gunshot] Don't get any ideas. Let's go. [suspenseful music] Shit. Jesus Christ. [ominous music] What's going on? You tell me. It's not what you think. The mob doesn't work like this. This is bullshit. If they want you. They can have you. [suspenseful music] [dogs barking] We lost'em. Why don't you go check around back, OK? Now. [birds chirping] What the hell is going on here? Don't worry about it. Everything's under control. AGENT CARTER: Under control, my ass. Now you talk to me, now. Sheriff, I need you to go back to your car and call for backup. Find as many men as you can, all right? Oh. [jazzy music] That's a good way to die. Where are they? There's nobody back there. Damn. [music playing] Somebody's gonna pay, man. [music playing] Somebody's gonna pay. We lost'em. All right, later. Let's find a-- a doctor in this hick town. Come on. [suspenseful music] You know, I thought you were dead. Yeah. Thanks for checking, asshole. AGENT CARTER: ROBERTSON: I hate to break this little party up boys. But we got business to do. First business we got is to get me to a doctor. Oh, it's nothing. The guy winged you. Hey, how about I wing you, man? I'll be right back. Asshole. What the hell are we doing? If we don't find these assholes soon, we're going to have 100 red necks showing up in town and fully armed. Don't worry about it. We'll get'em. What the hell is this? It's a first aid kit. It's all we've got. - Where's the doctor? - He's hunting. The doctor is hunting too? I don't believe this town. [engine revving] How you doing? Huh? This hurts. This isn't my idea of fun, man. Hey, it's not my idea of fun either. But we've got to get into town. Those guys are still after us. We gotta get to the sheriff. Can you hang on? - Yeah. OK, let's go. [birds chirping] [door squeaking] Hello? [music playing] Freeze. Don't move. I'm a police officer. And I'm the President. [music playing] Looks real. So what are you doing sneaking around my bar? Put down the gun, and we'll talk about it. I'll keep the gun and you talk. You a cop too? No. I'm a killer. Listen lady. I just want to get out of this town alive. This man is a hitman for the mafia. And I'm trying to transport him cross-country. Apparently his friends don't want that. They want him dead. So put down the gun now. Lady, I'm not kidding. Put it down now. [intense music] Come on. Have you seen any strangers from out of town today? [music playing] Yeah, a few minutes ago, a guy who was in here earlier came in and asked for a first aid kit. What do you do? Well, I gave it to him. He had blood all over his shirt. But I think his friend was the one who was hurt. We're dead. There's no way we're going to get out of this alive. These guys are nuts. They'll kill anyone. - You have a telephone? - It's out of order. The lines are dead. So are we. By the way, you got any toilet paper? I've got some unfinished business to attend to. Let's take a short meeting fellas. All right, all right, we'll set up here, guys. With the Sheriff out of the way, this has got the best view of the town. We can catch any of the dispatchers that are coming in and out. Now, ah-- Carter, you take Thompson and have a look around. I'll stay here with Roberts. Let's do it. Be careful boys. Do you want to check the radio? [birds chirping] [suspenseful music] Jesus. [funky guitar music] Give me the radio. Are you locking it up? Yeah. Close it up. Repeat, close it up. [funky guitar music] Jesus Christ, what's going on? I'm not sure. Lori? Lori? Alex, where's Lori? She was working today. She's dead. What? What? She's dead. She's dead, man. Oh. Sarah. What is going on? Who's-- who's doing this? That's what we're trying to figure out. Now, look Sarah-- What? Lori's dead. No. Oh, my God. JAKE: Sarah, why are you here? There are these guys at the bar. One says he's a cop. He told me to go get the sheriff. He said if he's seen outside he'd be killed in a second. ALEX: Well, who is they? I don't know. He said some guys with the mafia were trying to kill him and some other guy, a prisoner or something. Look, whatever is going on here, we're going to need some serious fucking help. SARAH: I went past the year sheriff's office, but I didn't stop because there were guys in the window. Ah, Sarah, are these guys still at the bar? Yeah. He said he'd wait as long as he could. Oh, my God, Jake what happened? Look, just forget about it. We're going to need to go. SARAH: Where? I guess back to the bar. Wait, wait a minute. He said-- he said he's sure they'll be watching my every move. If we go out together, it'll look suspicious. ALEX: Man, this is crazy. So what do we do? OK. Sarah, just go back to the bar as fast as you can. Don't cause any suspicion and don't stop for anyone, OK? SARAH: OK. ALEX: How's the arm? Can you make it a little longer? It still hurts, but I'll be fine. ALEX: OK. After Sarah goes, we'll go out the back through the woods down along the creek. Will be at the bar in 20 minutes. Sounds good to me. Be careful. ALEX: We'll see you there. [soft music] Jesus Christ, what are we going to do? We can't take these guys on. Yes we can. I'm getting the sheriff's gun. [gun cocks] We're gonna fight back. Come on. Man, I'm gonna kill somebody for what they did to her. [barking] [birds chirping] That's your last beer, Montel. Where the hell is she? She's dead, pal. And so are we if we don't get outta here. Well, do you have a better idea, genius? You could give me a gun. Yeah, that's all I need, you with a gun. I'm a pro. If anyone can get us out of this, it's me. You know that. But what's to stop you from killing me? What's the difference? You're going to die one way or the other. You're a real asshole. I'll make you a deal. I don't make deals with pieces of shit. Don't be an idiot. Look, I help you get outta this, and you set me free, even exchange, a life for a life. Nobody has to know. Come on. It's your only chance. It's my only chance. Do you really think I'd kill you? I told you, I only killed the scumbags. I never touched an innocent person. Well, I don't want to make me your first. [traffic noise] [gunshots] Get the fuck in the car. Relax, I wasn't gonna hit her. I was just having some fun. Well, you pull any more shit like that, and I'll cut your fucking heart out. Huh. [loud country music] Get out you stupid bitch. Get out. Now, you're coming with us. Get out. [birds chirping] [music playing] [pool balls clicking] Oh, shit. She should have been back here by now. I'm telling you, man, she doesn't stand a chance with these guys. With what guys? So do I shoot first and ask questions later? Put down the gun. I'm a police officer. But where's Sarah? She should be here. DAVID MONTEL: I'm telling you, she's dead. She better not be. Because if she is, then you are too. Oh, I'm not impressed, kid. Shut up, Montel. Now listen, I'm going to reach into my pocket, and I'm going to pull out my badge. Just do it nice and slow. [soft music] So if you're a cop, why are people being killed? Listen, I don't have time to explain all the details to you guys. We don't have much time, all right? So either pull the trigger or put the gun down. Look, you said we didn't have much time. Time for what, goddammit? SGT. PHIL TOWERS: Time before our little friends get over here. Looks like you've already met them. These guys are professionals. They work for the mob. And this guy is a witness. And all I want to do is get him to court alive. Look, I don't care who he is or you, just get the fuck out of this town. It's too late for that, kid. They know we're here. And they ain't gonna leave without us. Well, what if we get them first? Come again? I mean, what if we go after them instead of sitting like ducks on a pond? You have no idea what you're in for. These guys are pros and probably outman us five to one. Do you think they really still have Sarah? Yeah. but I wouldn't worry. They won't kill her right away. They'll have some fun with her first, then they'll kill her. You sonofabitch. [gunshot] You can't get away. We got ever road out of town blocked. [eagle screeching] So ah-- so why don't you just be good fellas, eh? Send that Montel out. [eagle screeching] Shit, we gotta get outta here. Give me a gun, man, I can help. Look, why don't you just throw him out front? It's him they want, not us. Well, maybe we can slip out the back. Not likely. Well, I think Sarah's got a couple more guns stashed somewhere. I'll find them. OK. See now, you're so sure we're going to die, I guess this won't hurt anything. Now you're thinking. Look, well, Jesus Christ, what the hell are you doing? This guys' a killer. A killer is exactly what you need right now. Here, stop your bullshitting and go help your friend find some guns. [gun cocking] [birds chirping] What's it gonna be? You want me to blow up this whole town or what? All right hotshot, show us what you got. DAVID MONTEL: Go to the window and cover me. I've got an idea. [suspenseful music] Hi guys. It's me. [MULTIPLE GUN SHOTS AND COUNTRY MUSIC] Well, that was a hell of a plan, asshole. We've got to move fast. That school bus, does it run? Yeah. I'm supposed to fix the brakes. - You work on that thing? - Yeah. - You got the keys? - Yes. Give'em to me. - What? Do what he says. I'm tired of playing games with you, Montel. Well, you think he's dead? If he ain't he will be. What are you giving up your life to Montel for, huh? That Montel's nothing but a killer. Come on out, boys, with your hands up. We'll let you go. Cover the windows and stand by for action. [music playing] Holy shit. Guys, I'd say we got about 10 seconds to fucking live. Holy shit. Fuck. Ready? Ready. [multiple gunshots] Shit. What are you waiting for? Fire that damn thing. [funky guitar music] Oh, Shit. [gunshots] [FUNKY GUITAR MUSIC AND GUN SHOTS] Kill him. [funky guitar music] [cars exploding] Bastard. West. West. Over. DETECTIVE WEST: What? You missed. No shit. You missed your target and they're heading for the woods. [guitar twang] Dodge? Dodge? Dodge, are you there? Oh, Christ. Come on, let's get Montel. Something's wrong. Shut up. Just shut up. I'm very disappointed. I thought you guys were better than that. You sonofabitch. You're Here dead man Montel. You hear me? You're a dead man. [birds chirping] Come on. [birds chirping] Well, looks like we're going to need a new school bus after all. Yeah, but you're still buying the beer. Yeah. Come on, let's go. Face it. He got away. He'll be here. Come on. We gotta move. Was there anyone back there? No. They probably already left. Well, come on, let's go. Where you going? My house. It's about a mile that way. [gunshot] Run little bunnies. Have your fun. [ominous music] Well, what's going on? Not only did we miss Montel, but they've multiplied. There's four of them now. They picked up two punks I ran into earlier. Which way did they go? Due south. Now come on. We'll go and head'em off. No, we'll pick up the girl first. What for? Trust me. Let's go boys. [eagle screeching] [engine starting] So you ever pose for any pictures? You know, if it was up to me, I'd let you go. Why are you doing this? Because it's important to us. But you-- you kill innocent people. No one is innocent as far as I'm concerned, Well, then why would you let me go? Because you're cute, not innocent. Maybe later what's up? Grab the girl. Let's go. Come on. You heard the man. Let's go for a little ride. [HEAVY BREATHING AND RUNNING FOOTSTEPS] Alex, I'm going to need a doctor for this wound. It's getting pretty bad. Hey, help him out. There's a first aid kit under the sink. So what didn't you run? I will. It just isn't time yet. What if you don't get another chance? I'm willing to take that risk. You like this kind of shit, don't you? DAVID MONTEL: I live for this kind of shit. Well, I guess if you can get out of this you can get out of anything. You said it, not me. Do I have to do this myself or what? Shut up and hand me the first aid kit. So ah-- so you don't know where they might have went, huh, Sunshine? I bet I could get her to talk. I bet I could get her to moan. What do you say West? We'll find those guys. What do you say we have some fun before we go. [birds chirping] Maybe later. Right now we work. Listen up. I want every available man except the road blocks to head due north through town. Over. [suspenseful music] I found something to eat. How can you think about food at a time like this? He's a pro, remember? No, I'm just hungry. I've got a plan. Oh, I'd say so. How much of this stuff do you have? Don't worry, he's got a for a whole fucking army. Good. Because I've got a feeling that's exactly what we're up against. ALEX: Follow me. [suspenseful music] Holy shit. What is all this stuff? Heaven, baby, heaven. So what's your plan? ALEX: Well, this is it. We load up and go blow the hell out of them. Ah, it's a pretty shitty plan. ALEX: Hey, you're the one that pulled the kamikaze stunt with the bus. We're alive now, right? Listen, no matter how many guns we've got, we can only take two a piece. And that's not going to be enough. Look, they we're tracking us, which means they're probably on their way here now. Exactly. So we dig in here. We can use the 50 caliber to hold'em off. Well, let's get it. Put a gun and a whole box of shelves next to every window in the house in case we have to retreat there. And what are you going to be doing, cowboy? I'm going to make sure they find us. And how do you think you're going to do that? I'm a pro, remember? Yeah. Just be ready for'em. Oh, we'll be ready. I hope so. ALEX: Hey, here's a flare. That should get some attention. I suppose you have a tank in your garage. Not yet, but I'm working on it. [birds chirping] [suspenseful music] DAVID MONTEL: Mr. West, there you are. I could drop you right now. But that would be much too easy. [suspenseful music] DETECTIVE WEST: Did you see anything? AGENT CARTER: There's a house and a junkyard about a mile up the road. DETECTIVE WEST: Well, Sunshine, is that where your boyfriends are? SARAH: No. ROBERTSON: Her mouth says no, but her eyes say yes, yes, yes. DETECTIVE WEST: For the first time in your life, I think you're right. Take us there. OK, everybody, listen up. This is where we're going. [suspenseful music] [birds chirping] [suspenseful music] AGENT CARTER: Look, there's a flare. ROBERTSON: It must be them trying to signal for help. So let's go help them. That's too soon. Something's wrong. Hey Alex. Alex. - What's up? It's too soon. He shot the flare off. It's too soon. He's not calling them. He's calling us. - What? They must be right on top of us. You got that thing ready? Yeah, I got it. So what's the deal? The party's about to start. Let's go. [funky guitar music] DETECTIVE WEST: Pearson you move East. Larson you go West. Move in around the back. The rest of you boys come with me. [twangy guitar picking] [birds chirping] [twangy guitar picking] [suspenseful music] You want to come with us, sweetheart? [suspenseful music] DETECTIVE WEST: Spread out boys. ROBERTSON: There they are. Up the hill by the trailer. [suspenseful music] These hicks will be dead soon. Well, don't be so sure. These hicks ain't as dumb as they look. I'm shaking in my boots. Yeah, well, maybe you should be. You already missed'em once today. Makes the hunting more exciting. What makes you think Montel is even still with these guys? Yeah, he's still here. He wouldn't miss this for the world. Neither would I. [suspenseful music] Jesus. How many do you think there are? There's no way of telling. I used to hate these things. Well, don't worry. It's going to be your best friend real soon. [suspenseful music] Bring the girl out. Every good card player keeps an ace. [suspenseful music] There's no one in the house. They're all up there. Get her over there where they can see her. Oh, shit, they got Sarah. Hey, they got Sarah. Shit. It's Sarah. They've got Sarah. What are we going to do? We just want what belongs to us. [birds chirping] You give us Montel. We'll give you the girl. Shit. He did it. He did what? Don't you see? He set this up perfect. He left us here alone to kill each other while he's on his way out of town. Oh, God, how could I be so stupid. Look, they've got Sarah. So what are we going to do? We're just going to have to bluff. We're going to have to say we got Montel up here. And then what? I don't know. We'll just deal with that when the time comes. I know you boys are up there. So why don't you make it easy on all of us, huh? Can't get away. Let the girl go. Now, that's more like it. Now you send Montel out first. No, you let the girl go and come up the hill alone. Then we'll give you Montel. Well, I'm sorry I-- I can't do that. But I can do this. [suspenseful music] Cut her. [suspenseful music] [rifle shot] [guitar rock and rapid gunfire] [birds chirping] [soft suspenseful music] [gunshot] [guitar rock and rapid gunfire] Well now, if it isn't hillbilly Bob. Didn't anyone ever tell you to watch your back? I only winged you before. Like a good hunter, I've tracked you down to finish the job. You guys are fucking crazy. You're never going to get away with this. Well, you're half right. I'd say we're all the way right. You have the guts to pull the trigger. I'm not going to have to. [rapid gunfire] Where's the girl? I thought Thompson had her. This is just right. These guys are fucking killing us. Do they have a fucking army in there? Come on. It ain't over till it's over. Well, maybe it's over. [birds chirping] Go get the rocket launcher. Right. [birds chirping] [rapid gunfire] [grenade explosion] Cover me, I'm going in. Go. [rapid gunfire] [fire crackling] [rapid gunfire] [shotgun fire] [rapid gunfire] [suspenseful music] [shot gun cocking] [rifle shot] [twangy guitar music] [birds chirping] Level that damn place. Alex. Yeah? We gotta move now. [birds chirping] [large explosion] How many do think are left? I don't know. But we better watch the back of the house. Well, let's go. No, you stay here. Watch the window. Let's go. [suspenseful music] [loud thump] They must be in the house. I'll go check it out. OK. [suspenseful music] [door squeaks] [suspenseful music] No, no, don't shoot. ALEX: Oh, God, Sarah. Come on, somebody's in the house. Let's go. - Shit. Well, what about Alex? - I don't know. Let's go. Oh, how touching. He's not here. The guy you're looking for is not here. I'd say it's going a little past that, wouldn't you? Let's take a little walk. [birds chirping] Hey bubs. [birds chirping] Now why don't you boys put those guns down. Tell me where Montel is. - He escaped. [birds chirping] [gunshot] Ah, ah, ah. Oh. Why don't we try this one more time? Ah, ah. Where's Montel? [gunshot] [ominous music] [birds chirping] Here I am, West. What now? [birds chirping] What do you say we make a deal, all of us. [birds chirping] Like what? You come over here unarmed. And we fight man to man. The winner walks away clean. [birds chirping] [crows cawing] What do you say, Phil? You really don't have much of a choice. You're a crazy sonofabitch, you know that? Let him go. Let's settle this like men. [ominous music] [birds chirping] [crows cawing] [birds chirping] [suspenseful music] [birds chirping] [crows cawing] [suspenseful music] Let's do it. [birds chirping] [suspenseful music] What the fuck is this? You trusted a professional assassin? You're dumber than you look. [birds chirping] Whatever happened to honor? The only honor in a game like this is winning. [gunshots] [birds chirping] Freeze Montel. Oh, ho, ho. You've got to be kidding. I wish I was. [crows cawing] I'm going to turn and walk out of this town. And you're going to let me. Don't make me shoot you, Montel. You won't. That's the difference in me and you. You've got a badge and oath that keeps you from shooting a man in the back. I wish at times I did. [music with drums playing] I'll be seeing you. [music with drums playing] Shit. [music with drums playing] Well, I got you off the hook on the weapons charges. You have to get a collector's license, though. Thanks Phil. SGT. PHIL TOWERS: No problem. So what's next for you? I guess I'm going to have to go after Montel. Well, just as long as you do it in some other town. Well, hey, you keep that 50 caliber loaded just in case. I'll see you guys. Take care. Bye bye. Something tells me he's not kidding. I suppose you still want to go hunting, don't you? Alex, just shut up, just shut up. [music playing] [birds chirping] [dogs barking] [music playing] [MUSIC - RON DI IULIO, "ARMED FOR ACTION"] Running to the edge of tomorrow with nothing to hold on to. I'm hoping to be the lucky one doing what they said I couldn't do. If anyone tries to hold me back, well, it's not going to work this time. No, I won't stop and I won't give up fighting till I cross that line. I'm armed for action, it's a fatal attraction. Got to keep on going till I take a fall. I'm armed for action, it's a deadly attraction. I won't slow down till I give it my all. I'm armed for action. There's just no way that you could slow me down. Cause I'm leaving a trail in this old lonely town. You can talk all you want, and you can give it a try. But I won't give up until the day I die. In this time of twisted games it takes so much to stick it out. But I'm ready for anything and no time to live in doubt. I'm leaving the past behind me and moving to another day. I'm reaching for a desire that you say is wrong. Won't you listen to what I say. I'm armed for action. It's a fatal attraction. Gotta keep on going till I take a fall. I'm armed for action it's a deadly attraction. I won't slow down till I give it my all. I'm armed for action. I'm armed for action. JAKE: Jesus. ALEX: Hey, what can I say? I'm lucky at pool, lucky at love. JAKE: You know sometimes you can be a real prick. ALEX: Yeah. [music playing] DETECTIVE WEST: We're here on a witness protection assignment. We'd appreciate your help. SHERIFF: Well, sure. Ah, what's it all about? AGENT CARTER: Sir, you understand. We have to have your full support. Our witness will be coming through here in the next three or four hours. DETECTIVE WEST: You must tell no one, absolutely no one, not even your own men. AGENT CARTER: Ah, how many men are on duty today? SHERIFF: Actually just me. But I don't understand what you want me to do. [music playing] LORI: Hi, I'm Lori. I'll be your waitress today. SGT. PHIL TOWERS: Where's your bathroom? LORI: Down to the left. You guys are eating aren't ya? DAVID MONTEL: Of course we are, sugar. SGT. PHIL TOWERS: Come on, move it. We'll be back in a minute. [music playing] [MUSIC - RON DI IULIO, "ARMED FOR ACTION"] I'm armed for action. It's a fatal attraction. I'm armed for action. It's a deadly attraction.
