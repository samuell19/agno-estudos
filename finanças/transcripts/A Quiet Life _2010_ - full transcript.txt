I'm sorry. They're all reserved. It was a good hunt. Look at the tusks, this son of a bitch! There was a deer too. I followed it for two hours. Then I lost it. I need a rifle. What kind? A small one. Then you want a handgun. - Why,.. you got one? No. What for do you need a rifle? Did Pavel show up again? Pavel? Yes. The Polish waiter who used to steal. Did he threaten you again? Yeah, may be... You'd better call the police. - Hey, Die'? - What? Rosario, how long have you been living in Germany? Edua', I don't know... You never know anything. Hey, chef... What are you doing? - Nothing. Tie your hair, you're gross. Biebesheim. The investigation into the murder of Michael Richter. Investigators are still looking for new clues. The WEV chief was found dead yesterday near the incineration plants. Die'? I'm watching TV. What do you understand? Ask Rosario to translate. Michael Richter should have signed next month.. a contract for the disposal of 20,000 tons of waste coming from Campania. - Did he tell you anything? - No. - Didn't he have fun? - Don't be an idiot. We gave him such a show! Should I wash yours as well? - No. You're gross with your dirty underwear. Boris! What! Not here! Understood? Rosario is not happy, understood? I don't understand you. No understand! When will I see you? I want to give you a gift. Rosario no happy me and you. Rosario? What do you care about Rosario? Tonight. My car - Tonight... - Here. Ok. Everything OK? Everything OK. - Were you with my husband yesterday? - Yes. And where did you go? Business. I needed a lift. Will you take me to the pool? - Dad will take you. Do you have another coin? What are you wearing those for? - To scuba dive. - Like a woman? - What do you do? Come, I'll show you. You were supposed to bring Mathias to the pool. - I know. We're going now. His training is at 3. You can't bring him at 5. Diego brought him. - Diego? Yes. He was getting bored, so I gave him your bathing suit. Did I do wrong? No. Then why are you nervous? I'm not nervous. Oh... Are you going to swim as well? I wait outside, hurry up. Diego? Wait for me in the car. Diego! - When are you leaving? - I don't know. - What does the fuck means? - As soon as possible. No! You're gonna leave tomorrow. Clear? I don't want to go crazy. Do you know what I'm doing? Writing a letter to Boris. The name is Doris, Edua'. She drived me crazy because I don't understand a word when she speaks. Edua', we can't stay here any longer. Do you hear me? - Speak, speak. Rosario said that we must leave. It's not that we are having fun staying here. Tell him that as soon as possible we're gonna get the hell out of here. You don't understand. He might decide to call the police. - Call the police? - Yes. Rosario calls the police? Yo said he was OK! What happened? Aren't you friends anymore? Eh? What's the problem?. - Where are you going? Come in. May I? Come in. Rosa', I need a personal favor. Could you translate this letter for me? - Is it for Doris? - Yes. I'll put it in her mail box. I know who you are... You are Antonio De Martino. Antonio De Martino is dead. Dead, mmh? I also thought he was dead. But it seems that he escaped to Germany and he opened a nice restaurant, there. Don't you worry, Anto'... I always respected and loved people like you. Always. Lets do this: I don't tell a thing to anyone, not even Diego... but we all must try to cool down, and stay calm, because nothing happened. We stay two more days here in Germany... Do you have a problem? No problem. The first day on the job, the maitre d' comes, grabs me by the ear and says: You here don't see anything, don't hear anything. - Good for him. - Wait, let me finish... You must understand what it is like to work at the Hotel Danieli... You can't make a mistake. No, if you make a mistake, they fire you on the spot, imagine how tense was I. Anyways, 3 days later he comes back, grabs me by the other ear and says: "I introduce you to this midget". "What do you mean, a real midget?" A real midget. He must have been 40 years old... He says: "Take him to the suite". In the suite there was a sultan, a real sultan, I don't know exactly from where... Anyways... While I escort him, I'm thinking: "Why does the sultan need a midget?" Maybe for some kinky play with the wives"... And instead... the suite's doors open... and there was: the sultan, his wives, a persian rug with pillows all around, some sort of a ring! On the ring there were two young kids in underwear and tank top, they were the sultan's sons, and they started fight with the midget a sort of wrestling match... THey were hitting the midget! They were punching him hard and he was trying to get away, he was cavorting... They punched him real bad! Arabs do stuff like that... No, no... Arabs have nothing to do with it. I meant that who forces you to do bizarre things is the hotel, the hotel! Consider that back than he didn't even know how to cook. He didn't know shit. So they assign him to deliveries, cleaning, shit like that. But he does anything and everything they ask him to do. He works 20 hours a day, just like a slave, not a world, just learning... On top of that, back than when we first met, his wife just died and his son... I don't know if you knew that... A car accident... Did you know that? Yes. Explain, how did that happen? Hey, Chef... We were just talking about you. We were talking of when we were sailing on the Baltic. Do you remember? On the Baltic he was eating berries, he... He couldn't even cook scrambled eggs and now he thinks he's a great chef. Tell them that you were eating berries. After the Baltic we stayed 2 years in Hamburg, we used to work in a restaurant owned by an old man from Palermo. His name was Sergio... Ah, I heard he's still alive. Did'nt I tell you? He's still alive, imagine that. What's wrong Rosa'? Nothing... Why? We're out of wine, come with me. You can pick whatever you want. - Careful with your feet. - Yes, yes. Go, go... Choose the one that you like. There are wines fron France, Germany... Italy... Italy, French, Germany... I know nothing about. You choose, Rosa'. Rosario? Rosario? There you are! Yes. - Pastor Bauer is dying, we must drive her wife to the clinic. You go, please. I can't do everything myself. I'm destroyed, I need some sleep. Okay, I'll go. Thanks. Diego, I must go to the hospital. Come along, I need to talk to you. You're a priest, right? Now that you're dying, you can talk to our Lord. I killed many times and He knows it... He also know that I repented... I renounced all I had... The family, the respect of my friends, my son... I was in hiding for 15 years... He gave me a new life. You must ask Him why he came to take everything back. Ask Him. I know why He did it... He doesn' give a shit about helping people. Eduardo knows who I am. What the fuck you say? He told me... It's not possible. It's not your fault, I made a mistake. I should have make you believe that I was dead, just like I did with everyone. I'm gonna talk to him, tomorrow we are leaving and you will never see me again. Eduardo? Edua'? Edua', are you here? Edua'? What did you do? Over there there is a pail and a rag. Don't use too much detergent, leave the dirt on the floor. Get moving. Tomorrow you're going to Hamburg, go see Sergio, at the "Cavallino Bianco" restaurant. I'll let him know. Tell him that you need a job and new papers. Don't ever call anyone, if I need you I'll call. Throw away your cell phone, and stay in Hamburg for one year. Shave your beard, let your hair grow, learn German and in a year you find a new job. Don't trust anyone, especially Italians. Avoid them. Don't make friends. Work, go to bed early. You must become a ghost. You leave tomorrow morning. If all goes well, you're gonna have a quiet life. I love you. I love you. Claudio, what's this music? Claudio! Good morning. - Good morning. Well? Did your Italian friends leave? Yes, last night. I had an appointment with Edoardo. Didn't he tell you anything? No, nothing. Got nothing to do, Doris? - Yes. Sorry. Should you ever hear from him... - Yeah, yeah,,, Claudio... turn off the music! Mathias with you? - No. Mathias, are you here? He's not in his room, we must go to school. Mathias! We're late! Mathias! Come here. Right away! What's happened? Did you check the kitchen? Claudio hasn't seen him. And was not in his room. I said he wasn't. Mathias! He's not in the yard. Who are you calling? Keep quiet. - Are you calling the police? No. I'm calling Diego. - Calling Diego? Why do you call Diego, Rosario? Why Diego? Rosario? Mathias with you? Is Mathias with Diego? Rosario, is Mathias with... ? Let me talk to him. Mathias, Mathias... Dad is coming to pick you up. But you must promise me, will you? Good, you do everything Diego asks you, without arguing. Understood? Good, good... I love you. No problem, he's with Diego. With Diego? Why must we do whatever Diego says? Why he's with Diego? - An excursion, I had forgotten. What the fuck are you saying? - Please, calm down. Why should I calm down? Why Mathias is not at home? I told you! An excursion with Diego! Tell him to bring him back home! If he doesn't bring him back immediately I'll call the police! Listen to me, come on! - Listen to what? My son is with a stranger! What should I listen to? I'll call the police! - No police. Why, no police? No police. - Why? Of course I can call the police, and I'll call now! I said no police! Clear? You are crazy. Trust me. But you must talk directly to Mario, understood? You must tell him it wasn't my fault, that I'm gonna do whatever he wants. That I'm on my knees. Listen, I'm coming to Teano. I'll be there by 6 PM. I'm bringing my father. He's not with me, but he's coming... I'll wait for you there, then Mario will decide what to do. He's coming now... - Dad! - Calm down. - Leave him. - Sit down. First you leave him and than I sit down. OK? Now sit down. Did he hurt you? - No. Did he make you cry? - I want to go home. We'll go now. But I have to speak to Diego first. - What did you tell him? - That I was taking him home. They are gonna pick us up shortly. I'm not like you... I won't escape to Hamburg. - I must talk to my wife. - Make it fast. Renate. Mathias is with me. Now I'll pass him, but listen,.. We are at Teano,.. at the highway restaurant,.. come take him! Renate,.. this is the only way. Hello mom,...! Anto'... Raffaele... I'm sorry we are in this situation. It's not your fault. What did Mario say? What do you think? He lost a son. Mathias... Listen, you stay here and wait. Yes. Buy yourself an icecream. All done, Anto'? Go. Go. Where are we going? You follow me, and don't worry. - I didn't leave him any money. - Come on, drive. Put that away, there's no need. Go. I'm afraid of dying. I thought I wasn't, but instead... I couldn't know that it was gonna end this way. I just wanted to see you. It's my fault... It's your fault, it's your fault, it's your fault... Because you didn't give a shit! - Not true. - Then why did you run away? - I did it for you as well. - Yeah, right...for me. - Yes. Why didn't you take me to Germany with you? Don't stop. If I don't stop they are gonna kill us both. I told you not to stop! Diego? Diego! Diego! Mathias, wake up. Look, Kim. You've been good. Dad loves you. Go tell mom that we are here. Is it free?
