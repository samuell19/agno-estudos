I am "Big Nonoy". Cunts everywhere. Cunts to make a profit from. If we put all these cunts to work, the Philippines would be filthy rich. That one? Her cunt needs exercise. It's probably hard to find her cunt. Looks like you got some last night. I'd like to eat your cunt. I wonder how many times this grandma's been screwed. This chick finally realized there's money to be made from her cunt. Be a good girl there. They'll treat you like family. Be sociable. Be friendly. If you need me, you know where to find me. Hmm. It's up to God. Better than wandering here and there, or going back to Auntie. Or be courted by God knows who, then getting pregnant. Or becoming a mother, taking care of a kid, taking care of a husband. Is that all there is? It won't end. Watch over money. I guess... this is okay. They should be satisfied. They should be pleasured. You should know the needs of your customers... so they'll come back for more. Remember... men come here only for one thing. Do you know what that is? Cunt? No. Fantasy and power. Fantasy. Because only here can they do... what they can't do with their wives at home. Power, because here, they have the power to do what they want to do. Out there, they're belittled by their bosses, or they manage failed businesses. Maybe their wives are cold in bed. But here... they're kings. Because of you, they lose their inhibitions in bed. Lust isn't the only thing that brings them here. Sadness brings them here too. Something missing in their lives. If he stinks, I'm not doing anything with him. Quiet. I don't want the new girl to think like you. We have a new girl... Ditas. Ditas? Take your clothes off. You can't be shy here. Big Nonoy will be like your big brother. He'll look out for you. He's my nephew. We're a family here. We don't fight or argue. And we forbid pimps from having affairs with their girls. Take your clothes off. The half-slip. I'm menstruating. Call me Mama Xedes. Take off the half-slip. You can keep the panty on. Aw. Here. The lotion is for smoother skin. Multi-vitamins to make you healthy. Nonoy, make sure she takes these everyday. This is to make your armpits and cunt smell good. Customers are turned off by bad smells. Shave that. This is where you'll sleep, where you'll also bring the customer. Clothes, lotion, soap, perfume, I take care of all of that... unless you want another perfume. That, you buy yourself. Did you go to school? Only until the third year high school. Resume your schooling. I'll pay for it. - Hurry up. - What's your name? Huh? Your stage name. For the customers. You need another name, like a movie star. "Melody" will do. - Are you really a virgin, Melody? - Yes, ma'am. Our agreement is clear. The house gets 60% of your earnings. You get 40%. Tips you can keep. But you'll earn more if you charm the customers. - Hmm. - Uh huh. Okay, go fix yourself up. She's been reserved, take care of her. Watch her, look out for her, teach her the rules. She could replace Barang. Mama Xedes, maybe you could lend me some money? - Later. - I just need a small amount. I told you to get dressed ages ago! Take care of her. You're the only one I trust with the new girls. It's nothing. It'll just take a moment. It'll enter me, hurt a little. Then, they say, I'll feel good. It's up to God. I guess it's okay here. No worries. Everything is free. What happens to me? Same as before. I'll handle you. What if all your attention... goes to the new girl? Fool! Mama Xedes says you're all equal here. - Look for a new handler, if you want. - But I want you. Then that's that. My mother's dead... And I wasn't able to ask forgiveness from her. My mother's gone. - What's with her? - She came from her mother's burial. - How are you? - I'm okay. Hey you! Don't be a bitch! That's my role with the customers, to be aloof and bitchy. Try being sweet. You can't be sweet because I'm the sweet one. You can be the hard-to-get religious girl. Some customers like that. Hey Amy, your kid's all over the place! Mommy, play with me. Let's play. Niccolo! You're such a handful! Come with me. Why is that child here? He and his mom don't have any other place to go. A virgin. Her first customer is such a lucky bastard. Who will it be? The Governor? The Police Chief? The Congressman? What a gorgeous creature... I wish I could court her. And to think she ended up with us. If she hung out in hotel lobbies, I'd have her by now. What do I do, big brother? Nothing. Just lie down and spread your legs. I know, but what do I say? Nothing. Will it be dark? It depends. Some men like doing it with the lights on. What if I can't handle the pain? If it hurts, show it in your face. He'll like that. If he's the governor, then he's a powerful man. I'm scared. In bed, all men are the same. They come, but not at the same time. Do you like your job? I don't know. Are you really a virgin? I haven't gone all the way. Fuck the Governor. Do you want the Governor to have us raided? We made him wait for nothing! It was an accident, see? Who wants to be in an accident? She even has a bruise on her knee. Fuck! Who'll want her with all those bruises on her knees? Go and file a police report! It was such a small accident. You! Go back to your room and stay there. You've been reserved. Yuck! I don't like him. He looks like an ape! Excuse me, I'm going to the comfort room. Yuck! Does he even have money to pay us? He looks like he can't even afford shampoo! I think he saved up to do it with you! - I think he has a dandruff problem! - Or dog fleas! - Let's go to the comfort room. - Wait, where are you going? Don't be afraid. He's just a guy. Come here! Stand and let him see you. Shit, what a pig! I'll bet he's bigger than the bed in my room! - You can have a threesome with him. - You can handle him alone, sister. - And I'm your future self. - Don't tease him, he's my regular client. - Shit, an antique! - Stop, he was my teacher in grade two. - He looks like Mama Xedes' classmate! - Paging Mama Xedes! That one gives great blow jobs. Your eyes will pop out of their sockets! You sure? She's good, she's Mama's niece. If she misbehaves, tell me. We exercise strict quality control here, buddy. Don't do that. You don't want me to move? Close your eyes. Don't move. Don't speak, don't breathe. - Act like you're dead. - Don't breathe? - I said don't talk! Do the dead talk? - But I'm not dead! Just pretend! I won't get hard if you act like you're alive. You should have gone to a funeral parlor, weirdo! My wife and I always fight about the bath soap we use at home. Green is my favorite color... I think green soaps remove dead skin better than the others. Aren't we going to take our clothes off? - No, I didn't come here for that. - What about me? - Don't worry, I'll still pay you. - Let me tell you something... - I agree that green soaps clean better. - Is that so? Yes. They clean my armpits and joints better. Tell your wife she's stupid for arguing with you. Wait, wait! What is wrong? I've been lying down so long my back is aching. And you've torn so many condoms. - Please hurry up! - I can't rush it. You have to. Other customers are waiting for me. Concentrate! Niccolo, what are you doing there? I can't sleep, mommy. Don't worry, I'll sleep with you later. Mommy just has to attend a conference. (singing) I can't take it... I can't take it... I can't take it... I can't! I can't take it... I can't take it... What's wrong? Why? Why? Hey, what's wrong? When I see you... When I see your breasts... I feel so jealous. I wish I had breasts too! And to think you're also very pretty! How many have you had? He was my sixth. Have you rested? Not yet. How can you do all those blow jobs? Hand jobs too. Men like blow jobs more than fucking. But you do so many! Being Mama Xedes' niece really makes you special! Do blow jobs make the jaw bigger? What do you think? I don't know. Maybe a little. Maybe not. But hey...is that an Adam's apple growing there? I'm only joking. Dino, can't we have something else for breakfast? - I'm sick and tired of this. - That's all Mama Xedes' money can buy. Be thankful we have breakfast. If you don't like it, then buy your own! Did I gain weight? No...You look the same. Why? I just feel fat. When I try to wash my ass, I can't reach it. Stop it, Big Mama, they're still eating! Stop eating noodle soup. You're beginning to look like the soup bowl. Why don't you try that tea that makes you thin? - You know... - Ginsing. - Ginseng? - That's it. - I'm going. Bye. - Bye. Take care! Ditas. I'll give you a ride. Metaphor is a figure of speech in which a word or phrase is what? Andrew... Sir, a word or a phrase is uh... Sir, it's just a comparison. Bastantitas... Sir, that's a...a... a word or a phrase... used in place... in place... of...of another to... - Dino, the next one. - Who's next? - Get your urine samples ready. - Yvette, you're next. - So, when will you be displayed? - Mama Xedes won't allow me yet. - Will it be Governor or Congressman? - I don't know. If it's Governor, tell him during sex that you became a whore because your mom's dying of cancer. I told you both my parents are gone. - My God, it's just a lie to earn pity. - To earn a bigger tip. - Sometimes I even say I live like a rat. - But you do live like a rat! Say that your dad's paralyzed, or that your brother's a drug addict. Or that your child has leukemia, those things. - You tell them you have a child? - Lucy, you're next. Lucy can't hide anything. Me, I work hard for my money. They give me large tips because they like what I do. Me, I give the customer whatever he wants I treat them like lovers. Councilor Durano could be my next lover. Girl, I've had him. He doesn't give good tips and his dick is crooked! Amy, Why'd you bring your son here? Niccolo's feverish. He doesn't want me to leave him. - You'll have to take the day off. - I can't, Phil's coming. Melody, you're not working later, can you watch Niccolo while I work? - Okay, sure. - Amy, your turn. Bong's in a rush. Tissue. Just leave it there! Tissue. Thanks, Niccolo. Hey, game. What are these briefs doing here? I wonder who they belong to? A customer? Maybe they're Bong's. No they're not. I know Bong's briefs. - Maybe they belong to Mama Xedes. - Maybe they're yours. - They're your size. - Maybe they are mine! Take them. You're so different from my wife. Your ass is so smooth... like a polished shoe... while my wife's ass is full of rashes. And you smell so good. While my wife smells like beef stew. Good evening. Hello Phil, what happened to you? Amy's been waiting for you all week. - I had problems in the office. - Phil! - For you. - Thanks. Thanks. I thought you'd found another girl. Come. See you later, girls. - This is a raid! - A raid? - Police! - Where are you going? - Come back here! - Out! Hurry! Wait, please don't hurt them! - Let me get dressed! - Don't bother! What's the punishment for this? How many years in jail? The police just want money. What do people know about this house? That it's a boarding house for students. Aren't Terry and I the only students here? No. Barang is studying dressmaking. Yvette was taking vocational studies. You're not the only one here with a student ID. Hurry up! Hey you! What are you standing around for? Mama Xedes! Mama Xedes! I think it's just a misunderstanding, sir. Sir, please tell the Governor that his new girl is recovering. Your tricks won't work anymore, Xedes. Lorenzo! What's this? - Why act like you don't get girls here? - It's the Governor's orders. Don't involve me in your shit! But my boss, the Mayor, and your boss the Governor, are political allies! Here, no one wears a mask. Their true colors always show. Here, no one has any secrets. Here, bodies aren't the only things that are undressed. Even one's character is naked. Let's just see if these government officials can act like this elsewhere. Here, all their shit is visible. But that's okay with them. Okay then...arrest me now. Handcuff me...c'mon. Babes...don't shut us down, babes. Have pity on us. Let's just fix this. I'm warning you all... next time, I'll shut you down! Let's go! Let's go. Bong, where's Nonoy? Do you come up here often? No. I come here only when I'm bored. The wind is nice here. Up here...it's like another world. Down there, there's no hope. Here, there's still some left. Brother Nonoy! - She can't, Mama Xedes, she's not ready! - I promised him! You saw what happened! - She has a tummy ache. - Your stomach aches? Aren't you always shitting? Fine. Give this damned whore a bottle of pills and bring her to the Gov right now! Fuck. What do I care? I've handled so many whores. What makes this one different from the other girls in our casa? Fuck, she's still a whore. After all is said and done, she chose this life. Why should I care? Hi Ditas, can I invite you? - I'm in a hurry. - Not now. In a couple of days. Our cheering squad needs one more member. Are you interested? I'll think about it. - How much? - Ten pesos. You want to talk about it? Talk about what? About what happened between you and the Governor. It was nothing. It hurt, but I wasn't there. You weren't? When he put it in, my mind went somewhere else. I thought about our province, about planting rice... Helping my aunt. I don't remember what the Governor did. All I remember is... his bad breath. Why? What's wrong? My customer's feet stink! I can't stand it! I'm about to throw up! It's bad enough he's ugly, but his feet stink too! I can't take it! - Tell Bong about it. - I will! Bong... My customer's feet are dirty! - Then tell him to wash them. - Washing won't help. They stink! - Can't you give him to Yvette? - Yvette has a cold. Good! Then she won't smell his feet! Ask him to leave! Go. Sir, maybe you want another girl? This one doesn't feel well. - Who else is available? - Lots. You'll like them. Really? Okay, get me another. - I'll get you a nice one. It's done. - Thank you! You two! Why are you dressed the same? - Change clothes! - Bong, my customer won't wear a condom! My customer came inside me! - Why didn't you make him wear a condom? - He didn't want to. He hates how it feels. Then you're the fool. It's your fault. Let's talk to him. - Dino, help Lucy. - What's the problem? - My customer won't wear a condom. - Then ask him nicely. - For all I know, that prick has AIDS. - I'm in red, and you're in red. We already look alike. So how can I be chosen? I got dressed first. If you want, you change your get-up. - Hey pal, she says you came inside her. - No, I didn't. - He says he didn't. - I asked and you said you weren't sure! That's right. If I did, it wasn't a lot. Wait, wait! First you say you didn't. Now you did, but it wasn't a lot! - I said I wasn't sure! - Why didn't you wear a condom?! - She said it wasn't a problem. - Idiot! So what do we do now? - She peed when we got done. - Did you? - Yes. - A lot? - Shhhh. - Shhhh. What does that mean? That's how much I peed. Shhhh. That will do. Just drink some Coke later. - Sir, next time, you must wear a condom. - Okay. If each fuck costs 500 pesos, and each Filipina fucked once a day, that would be 500 times 350. What's 350? The number of days in a year. How much is that? That's 175,000 pesos per year. But there are 40 million girls in the Philippines. So 175,000 pesos times 40 million girls is 70 billion pesos in one year. Our country would become richer each year. Cunts will save the Philippines. You know, Mama Xedes is probably filthy rich. I've been computing. She makes a lot. Where does the money go? Properties. She's not vain, but she owns lots of stuff. Have you been with her long? I dropped out when I was in first year high school. I was thrown out of our house. Mama Xedes took me in. Why do they call you Big Nonoy? Wow! It's like a turnip. But it's only one. I was born like that. Lucky I guess. Your breath smells nice. What do your customers smell like? Some smell sour, others smell like fish... Some smell like rotting leaves. Sometimes, they smell like chewing gum. Can I smell yours? Let me smell yours again. Who's first? Father is waiting. Move over. Amy, go ahead. Age before beauty. Because I'm confessing before I get married, you go first. Do I have to confess everything? Like what I did with Governor? Everything. Careful what you tell Father. He always has coffee with Imelda and asks for donations from Mayor. Big Mama, what are you doing here? You didn't have any customers. I'm not here to confess. I'm praying for customers. - What's with her? - Small Stella won't confess to a priest. She goes straight to God when asking for forgiveness. Go in! Your aunt will scold you if you don't confess! Mama Xedes went first. Isn't she brave? This is against the rules. Thanks again. Melody! - Melody! - I'm here. Melody! Where have you been? - Who's my customer? - Francis. - She's all yours. - Thank you. Let's go. Are you still wearing the briefs with the polka dots? I can't decide on that. You need to talk to Mama Xedes. - Here she is. - You shouldn't be here. - I'm here on behalf of Councilor Ramirez. - But he's with the Opposition. If the ruling party finds out that your party gets girls here, they'll raid us... ...and embarrass the Opposition! - That's our problem. - It's our problem. We'll pay the price! That was amazing! Moron. Why are you here? You have a customer downstairs. Where's Niccolo? He didn't distribute the toilet paper. Mama Xedes is there! Of course he'll get sick. He's always outside! Tell your son to be careful! Where's April? April! April! April! Where is that girl? Wow, you're so lucky, Amy! If Phil has a brother, introduce me! - I'll miss you girls! - Is that Phil guy really marrying you? Isn't the expensive ring proof enough? It's rare that a customer falls In love with one of us. Are you sure Phil will get along with your son? - It's up to God. - Niccolo, you're going to have a daddy! I'm happy for you Amy, but please don't leave until you find a replacement. Mama, do you expect Phil to live here? It's on the right side. I can't see it. The thing that looks like a slipper, that's a paramecium. Hey, you're right! It does look like a slipper. Why don't you join our study group? We meet every Monday. I can't. I'm busy Mondays. If you want, we can meet at your house. What's your address? These are the pictures I mail out. Look at what I'm wearing... isn't it nice and sexy? Look at this one, I have no clothes on. You're so single-minded, Terry. You mailed out all these pictures? No one's replied yet, I'm nude here. That was another pictorial. But I keep mailing them. Since I was young, I've dreamed of being an actress. What I'm doing now...it's just a stepping stone to becoming a star. - You're too much. - Why don't you mail out your own photos? So we can become famous together! No way, that's your dream. Just promise you'll remember me when you're famous. Just remember, if a Beverly Ramirez becomes famous, that's me! Why don't you go to Manila? Find work there instead of sending photos that are ignored. That's okay. I don't mind waiting. My time will come... Beverly Ramirez will become famous one day... because... because I'm tired of this life. I can't do this anymore. I can't. I can't anymore. What's wrong, Terry? What happened to you? It's nothing. I'm just practicing my act. Really? You're so good! You had me fooled, Beverly! Wasn't I great? I told you we don't sell ice candy! - No, Ma'am. I'm looking for Ditas. - I'm Ditas. - Huh? - What do you want? I'm looking for Ditas Bernadas. That's not my name. Go away. If you don't, I'm calling the town police. I'm sorry. Pardon me. - What happened? - What do you mean what happened? Can't you see it won't start? Mama Xedes will wonder about us. Stop using her as an excuse. You're just excited to see your cute client. You're crazy. Do you have affairs with all the girls you look after? No. It's forbidden. Forbidden? Then why are we doing this? Why? Have you ever been in love? I like lots of girls. I don't know if that's love. What if Mama Xedes finds out about us? Then we run away. But she won't let that happen. She makes a lot of money from you. What will happen to us? It's up to God. My rules are clear! No pimp can fall in love with his whore! But we don't have a relationship. Son of a bitch! Don't lie to me! I'm not stupid! Don't make liars of all the other girls here! What?! - Why do they care what I do? - Because your affair's bad for business! You're not Ditas' pimp anymore. I'm giving her to Bong. So...wanna bet that I'll be the first one chosen? - How old are you boys? - Nineteen. - Nineteen? You look seventeen. - Seventeen. Here's our ID. I want that one! The Chinese-looking girl. First one chosen, my ass. You know... you look like someone I know. A classmate I have a bad crush on. Take off your clothes. Get on top of me, now! Shit. Sorry, I couldn't help it. Sorry, it's over. - Bong let a minor in! - He was 19! He showed me his residence certificate! Just say he gave you a bribe! Don't accuse me! He's 17! He's my classmate! Bong, one more slip-up, and you'll be in charge of the garbage again. - You're not assigned to me anymore. - Why not? Fuck, I want to leave this place. Where will we go? How? I'm not leaving if you're not coming with me. You smell so good like Sampaguita flowers! Stop talking, you're wasting my time. Your neck smells nice. That's your hand...you can't use that. Son of a bitch! Fuck you, bitch! Don't touch me, I'll hit you! - Xedes! - Please let me explain. Xedes, where are you? Xedes! Xedes! Xedes! - What's wrong? - Xedes, this thing made a fool of me! - Small Mama, what happened? - What do you mean Small Mama? Her dick is bigger than a carabao's head! Fuck you, bitch! - I'm sorry, I'll get you another. - Okay. Let's talk. I'm sorry I wasn't careful. Son of a bitch! What? Go back to your customers. Now. Did he hurt you? What are you looking at? It's real! This is a real Adam's apple! When you're done, come right back. Don't keep me waiting. Don't be difficult Thank you. We need to be back at the casa by 6 pm. No problem. Melody! Psst! She's lying, Mama Xedes. I only spoke to one customer. You spoke to one, but I was fucked by two! She's making up stories. She doesn't like me. She wants to go back to Nonoy. Mama Xedes, this guy's making more money than he's letting on. Enough. Bong's been with me for years. He's handled lots of my girls, and none of them ever complained. There's hope for a simple whore. But a lying whore is hopeless. I can't stand Bong anymore. He's too strict. And he's so vulgar. - Nonoy! - Bong, fuck you, Bong! - You fucker! - What's wrong? What's the problem? You owe me! You're treating Ditas like shit! - Stop that! - Stop it! - Apologize to Ditas! - I don't owe her an apology! - Apologize to her! - Mama Xedes! You sons of bitches! Get out of here, Nonoy, and don't come back! What are you waiting for? - Nonoy and Bong beat each other up! - They tried to kill each other! Nonoy, where are you going? Ditas, wait! Ditas. You lied. You gave me the wrong address. Stop following me around, please. Ditas, I know. It was you. You're the one in the casa. It's okay. I still like you. Believe me, Ditas. I'm not just saying it. Here... here... accept this. Take it, please. I worked hard to buy it. Just take it. Thanks... But I'm sorry, Andrew because... nothing can happen between us. Anyway, there are lots of other girls. When you find one, then you can visit me again. It's better if you don't feel anything for me. It's better for both of us. - What's so funny? - So it's not true. What's not true? Barang said...that you're not a real girl. That you're gay... and that you had an operation. - Really? - Isn't that funny? Barang! Why are you telling lies about me? Are you so jealous of me because no one wants you anymore? I can give as good as I get! You bitch! - She's spreading lies about me! - I never said anything! - My customer says you told him! - Tell me which customer said that! - You've been picking on me! - I don't have time to pick on you! You're jealous of me because you're past your prime! What a bitch! Mama Xedes, did you hear what she said? Enough. Don't spread lies. If you want to compete, do better with the customers. Don't resort to backstabbing. Flirt! Stupid flirt! We go to bed with strangers just to make money. What do we do with her? The bitch got herself pregnant! I did everything just to earn enough money to send home... And my sister got pregnant again! What a miserable life this is! Xedes! Fuck you, Xedes! Ditas! What do we do now? Xedes, fuck you! Ditas! That old woman will just lie to you! Don't believe her lies, you bitches! Ditas! Ditas! Ditas! Ditas! Ditas! Sir, it's late. You're disturbing the peace. - I just need to talk to someone. Ditas! - It's late. Come with me. I'll talk to someone. - Come with us to the precinct. - Ditas! Ditas! Ditas! You have so many absences. Maybe I can do make-up work, sir. The only way is for you to do an extra project. Yes, a passing grade would be great, Mr. Lavarez. Okay, visit me in the gym tomorrow at 6 p.m. Yes, sir. You're free to go. Someone paid your bail. Go to the front desk. Just receive this, ma'am. Sign here. - You can go. - Thank you, sir. Thanks for the bail. I'll pay you as soon as I can. It's okay, just don't do it again. - Let's leave this town. - Are you crazy? - Are you happy at the casa? - Yes, I am. Everything's free... ...including my school tuition. Plus I get to earn some money. They're making more money off of you. I won't be like this my whole life. I can work my way up. You think you can just because you're studying? After you graduate, she won't let you leave. She said when I graduate, I'll be in charge of my life. But you'll still be a whore. - What kind of a life can you give me? - It's up to God. "It's up to God". You can't just leave things to fate. I've been there already. I still have some money with Mama Xedes. You're going back to her? I'm going back for the money. This is for Niccolo. This is for you. Thank you. Mama, don't be like that... you're making me cry. We'll visit you whenever we can. Fool. I'm not crying because you're leaving. I'm crying because Niccolo is leaving. I won't have a new pimp to train. Just remember, Amy, if Phil ever hits you, don't hesitate to leave him. Don't let yourself be disfigured like me. Mama... I promise not to do it again, Mama Xedes. I swear I won't do it again. Nonoy, you're drunk. Go away. Mama Xedes... I served you for 15 years. I took care of you for 15 years. Please, Mama Xedes... Forgive me. I don't trust you anymore. You destroyed it all because of that girl. How is Ditas different from all the other whores you handled? You cursed me, now you have the gall to ask for my forgiveness? - What is it? You can't survive out there? Just give me what you owe me, so Ditas and I can leave! - Then leave! - Not until I get my money! - Dino! - Fuck! Why can't anyone else have a life? I am the only reason you're alive! Nonoy! Nonoy! Son of a bitch! You have no shame! After all I did for you! - Mama Xedes! - Mama Xedes! What have you done to Mama Xedes? Fuck you! Come, let's go! - Mama Xedes! - Mama Xedes! He killed Mama Xedes! Mama Xedes! What's wrong? I don't know. You were forced to go with me. Why did we leave? No one would have believed it was an accident. They wouldn't understand me. They won't believe me. What will happen to us now? I always get what I want, Ditas. I have to. For us. Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch! Fuck you all! My back hurts. But never mind. This will pay for my tuition. Cunts everywhere. Fuck...so many cunts. If we put all these cunts to work, Fuck... the Philippines would be filthy rich.
