It's such a long way down and strange. The word becomes flesh. No. The body remains... what? She had traveled light-years to get here. And in the vaporous fields of her home star no one had bodies, or names, or identities - a living thought or feeling stretching out in all directions - not measured or desired. Not owned. But here, in the flesh the revolution had come. America had just been liberated by Triple M, the Multi Media Monopoly. A collaborator, I worked for the Ad Agency that swept Triple M into power in the first place and, despite fierce competition, kept it there. On the surface, nothing had changed. It was tough but at last we were able to convince the population that their choice of the new regime had been their own idea. It was a dictatorship of the consumer now. What most people wanted, most of the time, and were willing to pay for, was good. Whatever defied the market was bad. Mid-size, automatic, whatever. Disposable income was the chief revolutionary virtue. Everyone had what they wanted, always. As long as they did their part and threw themselves, body and soul, towards the aim of economic supremacy. But some people questioned the agency's wisdom. Some wondered if we hadn't lost something important in ourselves. Some people resisted the inevitable logic of the marketplace. A hated and feared underground had begun to form. The partisans. Counter-revolutionaries with no credit rating. Living outside the corporate body of the status quo. They were rounded up and exiled to the moon to work the concessions of the various Triple M theme parks. Terrorists were suspected everywhere. Like this. Right. - No. Down? - In. Down. Up. Back. Try it. Right, that's it. Will you be needing ammunition? And it was me, just me, at the start of it all. The logical conclusion of all this is to think of each individual as an investment: a stock, an actual property with growth potential. The analysis proves that sexually active and sexually available adults are the biggest spenders. And why is that? Because we market everything so as to remind them that their identification with obviously popular brand names will make them feel better about themselves and make them appear more attractive to others. It's the income generated by the pursuit of happiness that subsidizes the revolution's continued growth. I think the possibility exists for a sort of chain reaction of market value. Well, it sounds appropriately cutting edge but, I don't know... technical. Fucking. When two people have sex they invest in one another. Each one then goes to a credit machine, they scan in their bar code, choose the new sexual activity credit category and punch in their sex partner's name. When the central computer registers the two entries it pairs them. Then each partner's value as a consumer increases by a certain percent based on the current state of the market. It was just an idea. But that was my job. I was an idea man. Triple M took over and worked out all the bugs, most notably creating an insurance scheme that protected product and investor from the creation of bogus, unearned personal value. The consequences were to be expected. Acts of love, charity and eroticism for their own sake were soon seen as perverse self-indulgences. Inhumane, uncivilized, barbaric. It's such a long way down, and strange. The word becomes flesh. No. The body becomes... what? The problem with heart surgery is that it's perceived to be a last resort. A set back. One becomes stigmatized. It's for old people. Sick people. Frankly, it's unattractive. It's got to be re-directed. Heart disease can no longer be seen as a sign of bad living, wrong diets, age and infirmity. It's the kind of thing that hip thirty-year-olds might do because they can. People have to want heart surgery. It's their right! - It might be worthwhile Good thinking, Benson. Cecile, do you have those figures? As of eleven o'clock this morning Delirium is the leading manufacturer of Viagamon, the virility enhancement pill and many other sexual stimulants. I think we may be able to cross-collateralize our interests here. And in the short term create a recreational geriatric sex market. They'll want preventative heart surgery. I see a possibility with higher end health clubs. It will involve insurance companies. I was never the most ambitious man and my prestige at the firm was fading fast. And no wonder. Compare the nature of the importance my associates attach to the success of the campaign to that which I feel compelled to attribute to Cecile's behind. Jack? That's your account, right? Which? - Brutal Youth children's wear. Yes, that's me. I've been doing some preliminary conceptualizing. Yes, we've seen those. Nice work, Jack. But, to be honest, the feeling is the whole approach could be more... well, sexy. Much more provocative. The children's wear? Kids are not just children, Jack. They're consumers. Seems to have gone well. - Think so? You didn't get fired. - Look at that. What? - The sky. It's just weather. Cecile? - Yes. You have nice legs. - Thank you. Making a pass at someone was risky in the early days of the revolution. Although sex sold everything and aphrodisiacs were the nation-state's cash crop, rape was punishable by death and sexual harassment in the work place could do real damage to your credit rating. There's more to me than just my legs, you know. I don't doubt that for a minute, Cecile. Left. - Right. Complimenting Cecile on her figure was a necessary risk. I needed an alibi. Is there anything else you need me to do? I'd like you to go to the window and gaze out at the approaching storm. Like this? Okay. Now, there's going to be a security desk on the left. You know what to do. When you get her signal, move to the phone, punch in the code. I'll count to ten. What? - There's no one here. It's open. Look. - No, no, no. Come away. But we're right here. - No. Something's wrong. This is too easy. No. We shouldn't. After all, we work together. You knew that when you came in here. I'm just playing hard to get. Did it work? Maybe we should call this off. Why? What happened? - I'm doing this for the wrong reasons. There are no wrong reasons. You, of all people, must know that. Let's fuck and increase our buying power. There's this thing between us now. I'm sorry. Downstairs. Quick. You fucker. I bet you do this all the time. You can do things to me. I'll let you. I'll get you a taxi. What happened? - A bombing. Counter-revolutionaries hit the Triple M building. Come on, you can't stay here. Move along. Go back to your homes. All is well. Details at eleven. Go back to your homes. All is well. Details at eleven. Go back to your homes. Ten people were killed and dozens injured when counter-revolutionaries attacked the Information Services building. Government troops foiled their attempt to immobilize the broadcast feed. The assassins were chased to the New Jersey border, where a standoff is reported to be in progress. Cecile. She'd have to wait. I couldn't take any chances. I wandered the streets all night trying to get word of what really happened. Information came in pieces, contradictory, confused, too simple to be true. I sent three young kids out to do nothing more complicated than throw a few switches and interrupt the news. And now this. More blood on my hands, more lives lost. For what? A different idea of a worthwhile life? Some different conception of freedom? Or was I just doing the same thing as Triple M, generating opportunities for yet another kind of desire? The would-be hero, the would-be martyr, the would-be saint? How could one man make so many mistakes and live? Hey, Rachel. Listen, I won't be in today. I don't feel well. Thank you. Is Cecile there? No? No, nothing. I'll try back later. Cecile. - I'm going to make a claim against you. Well, you have to do what you have to do, Cecile. But I wish you wouldn't. You took advantage of me. - I thought you wanted me to. What will people say? - Look, no one has to know about this. I told Rachel. Why did you tell Rachel? She's my supervisor. She has to co-sign my insurance claim. In those dark days a person could insure their sex appeal. What had happened between Cecile and me was a small collision that had left her confidence dented and her value as a consumer compromised. The insurance company would have to investigate and prove that our failed tryst was in no way her fault. So what you're claiming is that you've never had sexual intercourse with anyone but your wife? Yes. - Who drowned? Yes, shortly after the revolution. Are you a religious man, Mister Bell? No. Are you sure? I'm sorry to be the one to tell you this, but with such a narrow band of sexual activity, even with your position with the agency, your consumer potential is very low, which, of course, means an increase in your premium. I just want to do the right thing. Cecile, your case is upheld. Your premium remains the same and your buying power too. Another black mark on the soul of the gross national product. I was a thorn in the side of the God-like economy, an inept leader of a resistance doing little or no good at all, a cancer the authorities wouldn't put up with forever and a covert strategist that partisans could probably do without. But I was glad for Cecile. I could understand her worry. It was a culture of desire. You had to want in order to be wanted and you had to be wanted in order to survive. Mid-size. Automatic. Whatever. Thirty-five. Thank you. Like this. Right. - No. Down? - In. Down. Up. Back. Try. That's it. Will you be needing ammunition? You sure you weren't followed? We did like Boss said, we split up. I tried to call. I thought they'd trace the cell phones. Then I contacted Orchard Street. Orchard Street? - They took that guy in. We saw it. We were standing there. William, take off. - What? Scram. The back way. Now. Help me! Help me! They're holding me hostage! I don't know what came over me. You said they took you hostage. - She's my sister. Arrest him! - For what? How old are you? Of course. It's such a long way down. And strange. Are you okay? The Boss is dead. Shit. No wonder. Triple M's been all over the place. I'm outta here. Find a place to be. Good luck. Can I buy you a drink? I've got one. Can you buy me a drink? How old are you? - Seventeen. Get out of here. - No, really. Besides, I like older women. She's healthy but extremely sensitive, physically. She's not barcoded. - I know. My guess is she's an exile, probably escaped during transport. Either that or she's... - An immigrant. Soto speak. - Any chance we can keep her here? It would be dangerous especially after the bombing last night. Triple M is on the look out for... immigrants. The major sore spot with Triple M was the old regime's alleged contact with Star 147X in the constellation Monday. Named after the hapless scientist who first discovered it, Doctor Vincent Monday. It was assumed the intelligence on that star still contributed unknown resources towards the counter-revolutionary aim. Whatever it was, if it even existed, Triple M was determined to find out. What do you call yourself? No Body. It would take her time to get used to it. The weight, the fatigue, the pressure of a boundary between her and the rest of the world, between her and others. Here, even time has a body, a direction, weight. There are twenty or thirty people all fucking each other downstairs. Yeah. I'm too depressed. Is there a credit machine? There's a lot of value being generated. Is this a brokerage firm? No. They just do it because it feels good. You mean you're counter-revolutionaries? We were trying to save the world. - From what? I don't know exactly. Your friend, the Boss, was he a fanatic too? Is that what they call it? - Malcontent, antisocial, enemy of the consumer, whatever. He wasn't from around here. What's it like? It's scary at first. Do you feel... taken advantage of? Yeah. It is such a long way down, and strange, to be one, alone. But to be one, whole. That's too much. Keep your mouth closed. Swallow. Relax this. Now eating. Chew. Listen, I have to go to work. If the phone rings, don't answer it. If someone knocks on the door, don't open it. Lay low. Lay low. Where the hell is Cecile? Shit! The CEO has been chewing my head off for over an hour! Jack! What do you know about this terrorist attack at the News Building? Some people were killed. And where were you when it happened? Here. Working. Cecile too. Where the fuck is Cecile? Shit! Forget it. Benson, in my office! Look, Jack, I'm taking you off the Brutal Youth kid's wear account. Putting you in charge of the soda pop in the schools campaign. It's crucial. Sorry. That was it for me I thought. Gently nudged from the inner circle while my associates orbited closer and closer around the CEO and heavyweights up at Triple M. They must have known I was a security risk. It was only a matter of time now before the axe came down full. Jack, you have a visitor at reception. I thought you were dead. But then... What? I mean, at the beach, in the car... You got my gun? - Yeah. Keep it. Are you okay? - Did you talk to anyone else? What happened at the News Center? - lt was like they were expecting us. I got this bad feeling, so I took off. But then they surrounded the building and it's all out war. But you managed to sabotage the broadcast feed, right? Like I said, it was too easy. So we just left. Well, somebody did. Maybe they did it themselves. As an excuse, like. You got to disappear for a while. Can't I just go to your house? I'm already under suspicion. You know anyone else? I met this girl, Cecile. She's like 25 or something but I think she's ok. My associate, Cecile? She's reactionary. I think she's coming around. Really? We only spent one night together. But I think she's beginning to see the light. You spent the night with Cecile? - Jack, call on line five. Okay. Find her. Give me a call in a few days. Be careful. Yeah? Thank you for coming. What happened? I met this boy. I was upset. He took me to a party where people make love because it feels good. Oh no, Cecile. It looked bad for Cecile. I came down hard on William for being so reckless. But after all he was my best operative. I couldn't afford to scare him too much. What did I expect from a seventeen-year-old, anyway? He was in it for the adventure. With a naturally high metabolism the attention deficit remedies they gave him at school had almost no effect. He was a natural born lady's man and had recruited some of our most effective female spies. This court finds you guilty of engaging in sexual activity that robs the revolution of its right to your personal value, generating no income for the common cause the autonomy of the individual, a gross impedance of human potential for progress, a blow against a thriving economy, an inconsiderate and perverse insistence on one's own selflessness. You are sentenced to two years hard labor teaching high school. Next. Because of the high incidence of handgun-related violence in school, only convicts were assigned teaching positions. Students were regularly sedated with attention deficit remedies and learned most everything through virtual reality play stations. Although everything imaginable was available on the web, certain texts had disappeared. Interactivity and equal access to information were the cornerstone of the revolution's rhetoric, but no one seemed to notice, or at least feel, the loss of expression officially deemed malcontent, antisocial, and cynical. I knew. I was the architect of the agency's Demographics and Target Marketing programs. The people were our targets and we listened to their language. We monitored their dreams. We took note of every choice they made in cyberspace. We studied their buying motives and propensities, then created messages that perfectly reflected their existing emotional states. No one could hide. Triple M could recognize any citizen as soon as they turned on their computer. The web would dynamically reconfigure itself to suit that individual. Something you could hold, read on your own, think about in private. This was considered elitist, immoral and bad for business. "Such is the character of that tomorrow which mere lapse of time can never make till dawn. The light that puts out our eyes is darkness to us. Only that day dawns to which we are awake." What is it? - I just wanted to say I was sorry. Can you run an errand? Can you bring this book to Convict 13K slash 2? Can she be trusted? - Yes, she's my friend. Maybe you should hide it on you. Convict 13K slash...? - Rita Morales. No. Not like that. What's that in your pants? No, not like that. - Here, you try it. No, really, I have to go. He made us do it. Where is it? 13K slash 2. I'm not through with you yet. Did you make them do that? - It was nice. Look, William, Martha and her friend are not my responsibility. But you are. And I'm required to ask you these questions. "Are you sexually active?" Go back to class. "The size and capacity of the human brain seems to have made its greatest increase in direct relation to the rigors of the Earth's Ice Age." "Perhaps the evolution of the need to think ahead, to plan, to wait, are attributable to survival in these extreme conditions, crisis." You have to go back. There's nothing you can do here. I can't go back alone. She was the latest in a long line of messengers sent to retrieve an errant son; some small lost chunk of their planet's collective intelligence. The longer she stayed the harder it would be for her to go back. Many more before her had tried, tried to go back, to walk back into the sea they had once walked out of so easily, only to be washed back ashore crying their first real human tears of loss and regret. Open UP- Be one of us. Get ahead. Be empowered. Do things your own way. Take control. You're in charge. Be all you want to be. It's a whole wide world. The future. Welcome. - Fuck off. Show me today's test scores. History. Tenth grade. Class D. Fall semester. History. Exam 5. Student 1397: Janine Masters. Score: 37 percent. Student 1267: Robert Formosa. Score: 54 percent. Student 6478: Emily Chen. Score: 63 percent. Student 7912: Warren Cucarulo. Score: 12 percent. Student 1959: William Hendrix. Score: 100 percent. Are you okay? - Oh, yeah. I'm fine. What happened? Oh, nothing. He just threatened to extend my sentence. Bastard. - But he didn't. He didn't do it. Where is he? He's absent today. Let's check the lavatory. He's here somewhere. He checked his gun. Bring the girl to my office. This was found in his locker. It's mine. Of course. You'll be charged accordingly. That's not what concerns me. This kid, William, he's scored 100 percent on every test this semester. He's bright. - Don't play dumb with me, 17B slash 8! Five. - What? - 17B slash 5. You know as well as I do these tests are meant to screen out the smart kids and keep the rest as dumb as possible! There's only one explanation for William's breadth of knowledge and curiosity! And you know it! What could she say? How could she tell? Maybe it was true. William was an immigrant. I had to. I'm sorry. They were going to arrest him anyway. It's okay. They say he's the leader of a terrorist youth group. He's wanted for rape. He's an immigrant. Rita, William is not a rapist. They throw parties where everyone takes sexual stimulants and make love without generating market value. SQ? So, it undermines the whole system. Cecile, please don't talk like that. What is going on with you and Principal Funk? We made a deal a while ago. In exchange for taking two years off my sentence we increase his personal value. He's got connections at the stock exchange. You mean you fuck him. He fucks me. Cecile. Up here. Hey. Come on. It's not too far to fall. Jack, we're gonna have to get a jump on that soda pop campaign. The city's decided to move the machines in tomorrow. We're gonna come at it from a new angle. A "news" angle. Abercrombie, has this product been checked out yet? What do you mean by checked out? It's a high caffeine drink. - So? Kids at school are given attention deficit remedies. Are there no adverse side effects? How do I know, Jack? It's what the people want. It's what Triple M wants. Triple M are the people, Jack. And don't take that high and mighty naysayer tone with me. Look, we've had our eye on you. Thanks,Jack. Doc. It's me. Can I come over? This is Jack's place? Yes. And who are you? No Body. I'm not from around here. Can we talk? What's the latest? It's this soda. It's likely to cause a reaction in kids under the influence of attention deficit remedy. What kind of reaction? - It's hard to say. I'll have this analyzed. How's our friend? Hidden. You know that if she stays here long enough she'll be stuck. We've seen this before. There's nothing she can do, for us at least. Can you convince her to go back? Maybe. If I can keep her from seeing people. That's how it starts. Getting involved with people. Caring about them. Mutual dependency, that kind of thing. Love. Eventually, there's no escape. Why have you come here, then? I was sent to bring my friend back. There are more like you? We are all one. But part of us once came down here and he got lost. How long has he been here? In your time? Ten years. Before the revolution, then. We're afraid he's addicted. To what? To being human. Jack, this is Cecile. She's an enemy of the consumer. Over there. - The bright one in Orion? No, next to it. It looks small from here, but it's really big. Here it is, Star 147X in the constellation Monday. That's it. That's home! Jack, look! It was too late, I thought. She had made a friend. You're the girl from Monday. - What does it mean? First day of the week. A new start. Monday. So, it's true. Star 147X is in contact with the counter-revolutionaries. They're just searching for one of their own. Some troublemaker who got lost down here years ago. Isn't it possible he's part of the resistance? You might have met him. I guess. I never would have suspected you. I never would have guessed you were a partisan. Does she always sleep this much? It's normal in the beginning. What are you going to do? I want to be part of it. I want to join the resistance. You don't have much of a choice. If Triple M catch you, you'll go to the moon. You're a counter-revolutionary. I like it, though. The danger. It feels good. Tell me what to do. Give me a mission, Jack. Well, for now. Just stay here with her. I've got to check in with operatives. NOW? Triple M is planning something big. We have to hurry. Do I still have nice legs? Listen. They're only tears. Water. Look. It was a long night. Hello? - Jack? Doc. - I can't say much now. But get over here as soon as you can. Hello? Cecile? William? I'm in trouble, I can't talk long. They're tracing my call, this could be the last time I'm able to use my phone. I need you to meet me behind the Indian place. Just go through the building two doors up the street. We have a mission. See? - Yeah. This drink combined with the attention deficit remedy will make even the most well-adjusted kid excitable, paranoid, and probably violent. What are they trying to do? They're trying to stir up trouble. The citizens will be thankful the state has put it to an end. But first... first, there must be terror. Maybe I can stop the delivery of the machines. Jack. Thirty-five. Thank you. Now we need coats. Right. Boutique. Who is this? It's okay. She's not from around here. Hi. Leave her be. She won't get far without her barcode. That was a close call, Jack. If you had fouled up this campaign, I doubt the CEO would have been able to save you. Why are you saving me? Curiosity. You see, Jack, we've monitored your existence here on Earth nearly since the day you arrived from Star 147X. Yes, of course, we know. We were with you at the beginning. How does it go? The word becomes flesh. No. The body becomes... what? I don't know. We were there. We were there as you tried to go back. When you tried to go back and you couldn't. That long walk back into the sea and the hope you'd be freed of this... well, this... body. Regrets? Is that what bothers you, Jack? You're killing innocents to make a point. No. You give us too much credit. It's always the same with you extraterrestrial types. Such idealists! No. We are the revolution because we knew the revolution was good for business. What we didn't anticipate was that even the counter-revolution is good for business. The resistance is good for business. Now, if you had come to us sooner, or if you would have been more frank about it, we could have gone into business together. A sort of merger. But now it's too late. We're taking over. You partisans are too soft. What's a little killing? The people themselves, the consumers, they can't get enough of it. We are what we eat. You're eating yourselves alive. And what's it to you? What do you really know about being a human being, anyway, Jack? It's eat or be eaten. If you don't eat, you die. Cecile says that you should go home. I want to see Cecile. Cecile says you should go home, you should go all the way home. No. Cecile's in a lot of trouble, you know. But we're not barbarians. There's such a thing as bail. Now, I know that you're an immigrant and that this is an assumed body and all that. But perhaps we can help each other anyway. I have connections at the stock exchange that will allow you to substitute for Cecile's personal human value. That is, if you're interested? Look, I'm not a political man. I'm just greedy. I want to have sex to increase the value of my stock. It's nothing personal. I'm not a pervert. I know about sex. - Good. The problem is that even with a drawer full of Viagamon, I can't fuck you enough to raise the capital needed to post Cecile's bail and to save her from exile. We'll need help. “Let us spend one day as deliberately as nature. And not be thrown off the track by every nutshell and mosquito's wing that falls upon the rail. Let us not be overwhelmed. Weather this danger and you are safe, for the rest of the way is down hill. If the engine whistles, let it whistle till it is hoarse for its pains. If the bells ring, why should we run? We will listen to the music they make instead. Let us settle ourselves and work and wedge our feet downward through the mud and slush of opinion. That alluvion which covers the globe. Till we come to a hard bottom and rocks in place, which we can call reality.” It was too late, anyway. Warden Funk was accused and sentenced for insider trading. His assets were frozen and he couldn't do anything to keep Cecile from being sent into exile on the moon. I tried to explain to her the situation we were in. Triple M was interested in keeping us alive merely as objects of study. But she had learned disgust. She had had enough of the body and wanted to go home. It's not possible. I have to go home. You can't. I will try. I've tried. I failed. You'll die. Maybe not. Your heart is too much here. Maybe. Come with me. Try. Maybe it will work, the two of us trying at once. No. L'll wait for Cecile. She'll be back one day. Besides, I'm more human now than ever. I belong here. Deserve it, even. It's only water. I'll never know if she made it. But i hope. And I try. To resist. Even me, whom no one needs pity, even I can see this. Now. What humans do. Try.
