Jesus! Ole! You motherfucker, McKee! You know, I don't make no nigger jokes, man! Beans, beans, the musical fruit. The more you eat... Knock it off, McKee! The more you toot! You know, Jimmy, you're an asshole too, you know that? Hey, knock it off! The both of you give me a headache! Well, tell these pendejos to leave me alone! I didn't do nothing to them. - What did my husband do, for god sake? - If you hurt my father... Shut up, kid! He double-crossed Mr. R, Mrs. H. He was a very bad, bad boy. - Now he's got to pay for it. - Don't play the dumb broad, lady. How the hell you think Jerry be paying for this estate you got here, huh? You get out of our house! Brusstar told you to sit down and shut the fuck up! You too, bitch! Your father is a dope pusher, kid. - You're a liar! - No, I'm not a liar. He pushes hard line shit to kids your age. And to pretty little girls who climb in the back seat of that Mercedes Benz to get their heads straightened out. You have a real great father, kid. You had. You're a sick man. I like it like that, baby. I'm totally craze! Hey, Brusstar. He's coming. Okay, Jimmy, the girl! Jesus, the boy! Dad! Watch out, run! Where the hell is the girl, Jimmy? You stupid bastards, go get her! Jimmy! I think I hear something over there, man. - McKee, where are ya? - Over here, man! Get over here by the fence. What the hell are you doing, Jesus? I'm smoking a joint, man. Yeah, well let's take it out in the arches over here. Hey, forget that bitch, man! You're not gonna find her. Shit! We'll never find that bitch now, man. No way. She could be three miles away from here. - I'll still look for her, Brusstar. - Nah, nah, you stay right here. Where the hell is that idiot, Jesus? I don't know, man. Come on, baby, give it up, give it up. Jimmy, you piss brain! - I did not! - Look at this shit, man. Come on, will you morons stop talking about this before the cops put your ass in jail? I don't have to put up with this shit. I don't have to put up with your shit either, Brusstar! I don't want any crap from you, Jason. I deal with Fats and I deal with Muriel. You pick up and deliver. Otherwise, keep your fricking mouth shut, is that clear? Yeah, that's clear, Bob. Bob, the figure they gave me was 380. So, fuck 380! I told that stupid bitch Muriel, Haron's Boy scratched in the fifth race, which is an $80 difference and that's all I'm paying. You wanna argue that, Walk? No, I guess I don't, Bob. No, I didn't think you did. Here. All right. So what do you want me to tell Fats, 5167 "516"? Not Bob? We're not friends anymore, Jason? Just business acquaintances, is that it? My friends don't talk to me that way. So fuck it, I'll get out here. We don't make that kind of mistake, Jason. I don't know why I should have to tell you this again! The numbers we give you are the same god damn figures that we agreed on with the players, and they're right! Everybody seems to know that except you, for Christ sake. What do you want me to do? Break his fingers? Maybe. Maybe that's what it's leading to, Jason. I don't know. I mean, it'd be one thing if it was just 516, but it isn't. You let these bastards get away with it once, and the next thing you know, it's a fucking epidemic. Now, I pay like clockwork. Well, don't I pay like clockwork? You are my runner. You tell me. Pay like clockwork, Fats. Mm-hm. Every dollar, every nickel, every dime. A player hits for the week, his money's there! So now I got it going out, but not coming in. Well what you're short is what you don't get paid this week. Wait, are you kidding? You can't do that to me, Fats. What the hell? I run that cab for you, not for the goddamn company! I ain't got any dough! So now he got balls, huh? Now he wants to fight! Okay, Jas', I'll tell you what. You collect from 516, it's yours. Same thing goes for 412 and every other half-dollar player that still owes us, okay? Plus! I am going to make you a real deal. You pull down the two-and-a-half dimes that fucking jig pimp... What's his number? ...606, Leon. You bring in the 2,500 he owes, you get half. You're a jewel, Fats. Now, in any event, Jas', you're gonna have to make up your mind. Either shit or get off the pot. I mean, look at you, for Christ sake. You're not exactly a wimp. You got a right arm stronger than a fucking ox! You probably threw harder than anybody in the history of Triple-A Baseball, for Christ sake. You could've been a right-handed Sandy Koufax. If you had the balls. You're okay, Jason. One hell of a guy but, the world don't give a shit about nice guys. You think about that. See you Thursday. Oh, uh, and Jason, don't push Leon around too much, okay? Fuck you. I've had worse offers. Jason! I'm glad it's finally happening, it's about time! - What? - Oh, you'll see! Go on in! You'll see! What! Figures. Figures. - Jason? - You finish? Well, you scared me. I thought... That's just great. This is just great, Linda. No shit. - Jason. - Don't! Jason! Oh, so you finally caught the slut. Good for you, Jason. You stay out of this, you old hag! Oh, listen to who's calling who an old hag, honey. I hope you haven't been sleeping with her, Jason. You better see a doctor, if you have. Jason, listen to me. She's just a crazy old woman. An old snooping peeping tom. Oh, at least I'm not a twat, sugar! You give her hell, Jason. Slap the bewaddens out of her! She deserves it! Jason? It's not what you think! Jeez, I hadn't thought of that. You mean to tell me there isn't another guy in there? So what happens now? Now, you get your friend, and you get out. Five minutes. I give you five minutes, max. So what if I don't leave? What then? Linda, I've been pushed a lot lately. I have been pushed a lot. Be gone when I come back. Aren't we hitting it a little heavy tonight? Played a double header today, Julia. Someone told me old baseball pitchers never die, they just lose their balls. Only their fast balls. So who said anything about speed? Feel up for another double hitter? Maybe I'll go warm up in the bullpen. You just drank too much. Had other things on my mind, I don't know. Other things? You had other things on your mind? I didn't mean that. Like what kind of other things did you have on your mind? Well, I had on my mind, like for instance, a big-titted woman, now this came off of somebody very small and I was looking for those wheelbarrow-sized tits - and it was just not happening for me. - Well, if you want tits, I'll give you tits. Oh, god. Oh, girl. Ah, you will take what you get and like it. You understand? I love it, Julia, I love it. Honest. Jason. One thing I know for sure. Tits isn't it. No, it isn't. It's not anything to do with that. It's just, I don't know what the hell's going on with me these days. I think I'm getting to be too old to think I'm gonna get back into baseball, that's one thing. I don't seem to do things the way they should be done. Being the arm doesn't seem like much anymore, and there's nothing coming along to take its place you know? I think I'm tired of getting pushed around. Fuck me. Can I get a rain check? Now I'm pissed. - Well, don't get pissed off. - I am pissed off. I don't want you to be pissed. I'm sorry. You're sorry? I don't want you to be sorry. I want you to make it up to me. - All right, think of some good way... - Well, you're in serious debt, Jason. - Think of something. I'm sorry. - That's all I have to say. I can't think of anything that could make that up. Think of something. Except maybe two rain checks. Fair enough. Two rain checks and a hug and a kiss. You sure you won't change your mind? You need three hugs a day just to survive. Don't forget. - Oh, and Jason? - What? Don't make it so long between innings, huh? Look, Phil, I filled out the trip report. I don't have time for the rest of that paperwork. All right, well then you tell him to take me off the list for a while, all right? I'll come back when I feel like it. I'll give him a call. Oh, I'm gonna get you in trouble. How much of your crap did you think I was gonna take, Phil? All right. Hey, Jason. I need to borrow the greatest arm in the history of Triple-A Baseball for a second, I can't get that off. How's the wheels? Ah, the wheels is creaky. I think I'm getting old or something. This is tough. It's been on there a long time. You can get it, buddy! It's the bottom of the ninth! You got bases loaded, two outs, full count! You put crazy glue on this? I wouldn't do that to you, buddy. It's too hot for humor. Send off that screwball, buddy, all right! Thank you, man. All the years I've known you, I don't believe how strong that arm of yours is. Hey, check that out. - Looks like lunch time's over. - Bullshit, I just got here. I got a lot of paying and receiving this afternoon. I can't be doing this. I don't need taxi business. Yeah, well after you get friendly with her, why don't you invite me over? - Are you the driver? - Well, seldom as possible, lady. The bus is right here, you know, and it's cheaper. I have money. This is an uncomfortable cab. There's no air conditioning. Heat doesn't bother me. How long can I hire you for? Well, after dark, I get a long tooth and very hairy face. I'll need you for at least an hour. You're a hard case. You know that, lady? I'm superstitious. How do you mean? Your cab number, 23. I was born on the 23rd. - Where to? - 501 Melrose. I'm superstitious, too. All gamblers are. Are they? When we get there, park in the street and keep the motor running. You're the boss. I'll be about five minutes. Christine. Hello, Ron. When did you get out? I... I called the sanatorium and they said they didn't know that you were still... It isn't a sanatorium, Ron. It's a hospital. I had a nervous breakdown. I came to see you, Chris. I did, honest! They wouldn't let me in! You were being protected, guarded. Anyhow, I got so busy here, I meant to... Oh, Chris. It was so terrible. Jerry. And the boy. Jerry was my best friend. My god, Chris, are you all right now? You must still be destroyed. I don't know how you're able to stand up under a thing... What kind of animals would do a thing like that? Butcher a young kid in cold blood! I had a lot of time to think while I was in the hospital, Ron. Al lot of sleepless nights. Horrible nightmares. I kept reliving it. Over and over, I relived it. Every moment. And the one thing that kept coming back, kept haunting me, was... Mr. Mr. "He double-crossed Mr. R, Mrs. H. So now he pays." Chris, look. You're not thinking straight, you're still upset! "Don't play the dumb broad, lady. How the hell you think Jerry be paying for this estate you've got here?" Christine, please. Please believe me, I, I... I didn't know what they were gonna do! This thing got out of hand! God, if it was true... If he was pushing drugs to young kids, maybe he deserved it. But Danny was my baby. My son. There's an autobody shop down on Weston. I don't know the exact address, but it's south of Wilshire. I know where it is. When we get there, I'll tell you. Weston, south of Wilshire. You can turn the radio back on. It's jazz. - I like jazz. - All right! Oh. I don't want to hear that. It's almost over. - I said I don't want to hear it! - All right. That's it right there. - Where? - On the left! - Down there? - Yes, on the left. - Okay. - No, don't pull in! Okay. Yes, yes! Go on, pull in! All right, pull in, pull in! Jesus Christ, lady. It'd be nice if you gave me a little bit of warning! I just did. All right? - You don't have to wait. - What? If I don't come back, you don't have to wait. Five minutes is all I... I ain't gonna leave without my money anyway, lady. Just in case. - Jesus! - Yeah! Slide me that 18-inch wrench, brother. Hey, man. We ain't open for business. This is a private place. Jimmy! Jimmy! Is that you, Jesus? What? Jesus! Son of a bitch! Goddamn it, lady! Jesus Christ! What are you, nuts? You must be crazy, lady! Goddamn it, they were shooting at me with fucking bullets! You stupid bastard! Jesus, they were trying to kill me! I'll never have another chance like that! They beat the shit outta me! My goddamn hands feel like they're broken! - They were all there! - Jesus Christ! - I told you not to wait! - Look at me, I'm bleeding! But you had to. You had to get in the way! - I'm bleeding! - Goddamn jerk off cabby! You stupid... Nothing. Son of a... Stupid nothing! Are you hurt? You're hurt. Oh. We'll get you home. Stay right there. - Can you make it? - 'Course I can. All right. Just watch your step. I can see. Don't look. Just like we're kissing. I don't know what you're involved in, but I don't want this woman or anybody to know where you are, come on. Just easy. Here. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Are you sure you don't want me to sit on the floor so you won't get blood on your furniture? Suit yourself! I'll never forgive you for what you did. You'll never forgive me for what I did? Jesus Christ, you got a lot of balls, lady. Forget it, Jason. She's not gonna forgive you. You might as well live with it. - What the hell do you know? - I know you killed that guy, lady. Now, I'm not real hip. I never saw a death before and it scared the shit outta me. I could feel it then and I can still feel it now. Give me a towel, please? Thank you. That was a sick thing to do, lady. Sick and bizarre. You got one oar in the water. In about two minutes I'm gonna call the cops and about 10 minutes after that, they're gonna come and take you away and that's where I think you're gonna be for a long time. Away! Look at my face. Look at my fuckin' face! Will you turn around, please? Sure. Sure I will. Just don't shoot me in the back, lady. What a fucking jackpot. All right? Yes. Thank you. Is it bad? No. What'd he do? Stab you? I didn't even feel it until I was in the car. I didn't even know what had happened. Doesn't look like a stab wound. I don't know what the hell that is. Guess I was lucky, yeah? Listen, I got some sads. Something we use for sliding bruises, raspberries, you know? Acquaint of sliding bruises, baseball? All right, well sit down here. It'll ease the pain, I think. It doesn't hurt. Sit still. It's my back, mostly. It's kind of hard breathing. I think you need some stitches. Forget it, I'm all right. I'm just glad to be alive. I'm not used to... - Does that hurt? - Yeah. After being shot at. How could you do that? How could you put a gun up to a guy's face and blow it off? It was easy. They killed my son. And here is the Channel Seven News update on the mystery hit-and-run murder of a car mechanic at the Weston Avenue Garage and Bodyshop earlier today. The homicide section of the police department have launched a city-wide search for an oriental woman who, according to the witnesses, escaped in a yellow taxi cab after shooting one mechanic and narrowly missing two others. The police report no motive for the slaying. This is Joe Ross for the Channel Seven News. They're looking for a cab with bullet holes in it. You got that? That's my cab. I gotta bang that window out quick. If you could get me to a bus, I have relatives in Chinatown. That makes me an accessory! I'm already an accessory, it makes me aiding and abetting. When it's dark! Let me wait till it gets dark, then I'll leave. You can hardly walk, you're ready to leave? You'll never see me again. I should get that lucky. Well, I didn't ask for it to happen! I just did something about it. What the hell do you expect me to do, lady? I mean, Jesus Christ, I got problems of my own. This is a big one. You're in a hell of a jam. You're gonna be on the run, you got money? - No. - Jesus Christ, I can't do anything about this. Look, I mean, maybe you can stay here a day or a couple of days, but I ain't gonna get involved. I don't care what's right and what's wrong, I ain't gonna get involved in this thing. I can get you some money. I got a way. Get in the bedroom. Clean yourself up. Here, take this. Keep quiet. Jason, the football game is almost ready to start, and I thought that since you're home, we'd watch it together like we always do on Sunday. - Mrs. Johnson... - I don't care if you yell and swear. - Just don't use that F-word. - Mrs. Johnson, I've got a date - and I'm late already, so... - Aww. Well, I'll just watch it with you and... Don't you even have it on, Jason? No, I don't. Oh, well, then I'll just watch it by myself, then. Okay. Goodnight. I hope you didn't bet too much, Jason. Just a small wager. - Oh. Goodnight. - Goodnight. Next time, Mrs. Johnson. All right, I've gotta leave. I'm gonna meet a friend. Leave the television on, don't answer the phone. This woman is a real snoop. She sees everything that goes on around here. Everything. If you so much as look through that window or move those drapes, she'll see it. Don't do it. All right, if I gotta get in touch, I'll let it ring one-and-a-half times, count to 10 then start dialing again. That's kind of about 15 before it starts to ring, got it? Yes. Keep the door locked. Uh... Hey, Lone Ranger. Go take your three-wheeler and go play on the fucking freeway. ??? You know, Jimmy, when you thought beating your meat was the best piece of ass in East LA, me and Jesus were running down the foppers for bringing back flake on a boat. Most beaners are good with a knife, but Jesus, he was real special. I remember these two rookie shit heels that tried to cut the connection. Jesus gave them a new smile. From here, to here. Jesus was a real good friend. His good connection had gone bad, so I guess we should thank that lady for turning his lights out. Nah. She owes us two for killing Jesus. Hey, Jimmy! What's the matter with you? You worked it out? Huh? It'd take two of you to make one fucking moron! At least I ain't one all by myself! At least I ain't like McKee! I'll be twice to you, airhead. Baby. That shit! Jive motherfucker. Come on. Are you two assholes through? If you wanna cut somebody, McKee, we're gonna find that lady and cut her up into tiny little pieces. Then we're gonna find out if that cabby likes Chinese food. We're gonna feed him those little pieces. Spread the word around. I want this guy to sweat it out. This way, he won't be disappointed when we find him. Marco gets it under control and gets off a good kick. Schultz waiting. He's got it at the 20 and he's off to the sidelines. He's got some speed and, oh, Nelson comes in. Oh, my. A fine tackle by Don Nelson who just came in out of nowhere. That's right, Jim. Don Nelson, a sophomore from Rundale High School in Maryland. He's got good speed and he's a hard hitter... So it was her. - Ain't you glad to see me? - That all depends. - On what? - How dangerous you are. I am a dangerous, bad dude, Cochise. That's what I hear. Have any idea who that was we were mixing it up with today? - You sound like you're mad. - Yeah, I kinda am, Jas'. I mean, it's not like I didn't see you pick up the oriental woman now, is it? - Wait a second. - No, you wait a second, man. All afternoon I've been hearing newsflashes about shootouts and killings. The police are looking all over the hill for a Chinese woman and a taxi driver. I've been trying like crazy to get a hold of you. Nobody answers your phone. I don't know if you're alive or dead or what. - I'm alive. - So who cares? - You wanna play it that way? Go ahead. - Yeah, I will. Sometimes you can really be a prick, you know? Is that any way for a mother to talk? - He loves me, don't worry about it. - Oh, I think it's sweet. - You okay? - Yeah. Not bad. As he dumps it off to Schultz. He's got some daylight! And a good run to the 40's... You gotta get rid of her, man. If you don't, you're way crazy, man. You got the police on one side, you got hard line drug people on the other. You wanna talk about a rock and a hard place? This is it. - I don't have much of a choice, do I? - No, you don't have any choice at all. You gotta wash your hands of it. Right now, five minutes ago. Are you kidding? You think I'm gonna toss the woman out on the street? - Look, I know it sounds cold, all right? - Forget it. Jesus. Hey. Look, uh... Just for my own peace of mind, what are you gonna do? Take a shower. You're getting ready to fill up the head, aren't ya? Maybe. Wanna talk to Leon for me? The pimp? Not likely. - Go easy on the fire water. - Yeah. Look, why don't you let me take this thing? I could get the window replaced in the morning. - I need it. - You could take my car. Bring it in first thing in the morning. Yeah, bring me some of whatever it is you've been smoking! While you're at it. Well, well! Hey, now! Ain't it Jason, Jason Jazz. What's happening? How you doing, Sharon? What's happening, baby? Faster, faster, ain't it, girl? Say, um... Tell me something, sugar. Yes, Delia. Is this boy feeling foxy enough to, uh, double his pleasure, double his fun? How about it, Jas'? Item two comes half price. Don't you, Sharon? Well... I know this is gonna come as a bad surprise, but, I'm looking for Leon. Why, you jive honky motherfucker. You still be chasing Leon around for a handful of chump change, cabby. Well, if it's chump change, then why don't you tell the chump to come up with it? Well, I'll be telling Mr. Leon what you be calling him. That's for sure, baby. Chump my burly black ass. We see who'll be calling who a chump, chump. You want Leon, baby? You know exactly where to find him. Don't you, sweet cakes? Don't you, Jason, Jason Jazz? Jason! I figured out who she is. The woman. - What woman? - In your apartment! The one you're bringing the goodies for. Oh, don't be a nincompoop. I mean the woman you brought in this afternoon! You're slipping. It happens to the best of it. First you see 'em leave, then you don't see 'em come, then they were there but you don't know what time they got there and after a while, you don't know what the hell's going on. You know, it's one of the laws of physics. You can't be everyplace at once. But your TV is on. Sure. Haven't you heard about the rash of burglaries we've been having lately? You are teasing me, aren't you, Jason? No, I'm not, police are keeping it quiet, of course, 'cause they don't wanna panic the neighborhood, but we've been having a rash of burglaries and rapes. - Oh, my god! - In the neighborhood. - My god. - Over the last few days. So, naturally, when I'm gone, I leave my TV on, just in case a burglar comes along, he'll think I'm in there and won't come in. I'd cut their gizzards out, Jason! close up your curtains, that'll help. Night. The old woman won't be able to sleep now. She deserves it. She saw us come in, you know. She's undoubtedly seen the news. She's a little bit eccentric but she isn't stupid. She knows who you are. Relax. The old lady and I get along fine. All right, let it breathe. That's enough. You hungry? Yes. Here, have some wine. It's sweet. French fries. Go ahead, drink your wine. Make you feel warm. You'd like that, wouldn't you? Meaning? Maybe I'll be safer out there. That I'm the mad rapist? Is that what I'm hearing? Or maybe that since I'm trapped, and since I'm a murderer anyway, what the hell, right? Wrong. And goodbye. Is it okay if I finish eating first? Sure. Take your time. If you were me, I mean, you know the streets. Where would you go? Doesn't make much difference. Once you walk outside that door, they'll find you in two hours. Every street punk in town will know where you are before midnight. At least you won't have to worry about being raped by me. I didn't mean it the way... Hey, after all, I don't know you. What you don't know about me has gotta be less than what I do know about you. I mean, who the hell are you? I'm sorry. I really am. It's all right. Can I stay? You ready to put out? Is that what you want? Isn't it? No. Hey. You wanna play on my team? I'm not very good. We'll give you a tryout. Do you... Do you need a player? Yeah, for a long time. How long? Very. Why did you do that? I wanted to. Thank you. You need three hugs a day just to survive. Passing on. If I get really drunk... Don't worry about a thing. I'll take care of you. You know something? You're all right. Not bad at all. Well, you're not bad stuff yourself. Go right in, man! Where the hell you been? I've been here since six o'clock. Well, there wasn't much I could do early anyway. Bullshit, you could come in a get this goddamn thing fixed and go into work like nothing happened, man! I ain't even working for City Cab. I quit the yesterday morning. - At least they don't go over your fares then, huh? - That's right. Yeah, but that don't make this into some fucking TV cop show, Jason! You read the papers today? What, you got no bullet holes in this thing? I'm disappointed. The DA's giving the fucking LAPD 24 hours to come up with something or they're gonna throw it to the Feds. - So what? - "So what." I can fix this. So what is this is big-time bad business, man. I mean, somebody's gonna goddamn fry, and you were right in the middle. - I'm covered, Tony. - You're covered. You think Calvin Brusstar gives a shit about cover? She killed two people yesterday! You don't even believe that, do you? No, I didn't actually see her kill two people, no. Of course not, no, you didn't see her. You're walking around in a daze! I don't know what you're trying to pull with this John Wayne thing anyway, man. Hey, wait a minute! I got no gas! I went to the bank, tried to get a loan. You know the end of that story. All I could get was this 350 out of my savings account. You can take my car and make your rounds while I get the rig fixed. I imagine the Fat Man's got a whole lot of money on the streets right now, right? You could probably put a big piece of it in your pocket by tonight. That is what you're gonna do, isn't it? Sure would like to pull down from Leon, though. Do it, man. - Yeah? - Yeah. Might have to slap him around a little. I'd pay to see that. So would I. Look, Jas', all you really got going for you now is a little bit of time. The fact because you work for a bookie, nobody knows where you live. Except me and a couple thrills, that is. So, uh, why don't you get your ass outta here, man? Good luck. You know, I don't wanna leave town. I really don't wanna get outta here. This is my turf. It stinks, but where am I going, Cleveland? Yeah, but still come back after a little while. And I ain't scared anymore, either. Well, so act like you are. Stupid ass. You never could say no to a lady. You know what I mean when I say I ain't scared? Do you? No, not exactly, but goddamn it, I know I've been missing something. What you're missing is your brains. There's an old saying. "Better safe than sorry." Remember? Well, then there's also "Nice guys finish last." - Not me. - Goddamn it, Jason. Don't blow it, man! I can't keep babysitting you forever! - What're you doing here? Never come to my office. - Give me the 80, 516. I didn't come here to talk, fuck around or argue. 516 again? I guess we really aren't friends, are we, Jason? No, we're not. You fucked me up, you put me in trouble. I don't beg down anymore, so goddamn it, pay up. Okay, fair is fair. Plus a buck of what you're already down this week. - You can't be serious. - You wanna try me and find out? Okay. Okay, I'll pay. Hey, Bruce. - Don't call me that. - Watch me hit this fucking ball. Watch this. Willie Mays! Shit. Hey, look, I've been checking around. His name is Jason Walk. Don't run. Everybody seems to know the dude. He's a runner for the Fat Man, but nobody knows where he lives. I told you to go to the cab company. I did, asshole. Look, all I found out was that the dude owns his own cab. They wouldn't tell me shit, man! The guy was acting funny. He told me to wait while he walked around in back. I figured he was gonna call the pigs, so I split. So we know who he is, and we know where he works, so we find him. Easy, like a $3 whore, man. Yeah and while the cops are looking for both, you're dicking around and you're a fucking idiot, McKee! You know that? Fuck your face, man! Bruce! Brusstar! You don't talk to me that way! You can talk to Jimmy that way! You don't talk to me that way, okay? No more of you talking. - Fair enough. - You're fucking right, fair enough! And I ain't going nowhere till I finish here. Cost me three bucks. Hey, McKee, let me try that, huh? You? You'd be hurting yourself. You don't know the difference between a baseball and a tree frog. Don't look that tough to me. Come on, I wanna bat, what do you say? Okay, wait till I get in here. - You ready? - Yeah. It comes fast, man. It comes real fast. Boy. You ain't the right color, honky. It's tougher than I thought. But thanks anyway. Don't ever call me Bruce. And for fucking A, don't ever call me asshole, asshole. And while we're straightening things out, don't ever tell me what to say, or what not to say! Okay? And by the way. Tree frogs are green. He don't answer no way, huh? How long has it been ringing? More than an hour. Maybe he ain't home. Tell you what. You leave that son of a bitch off the hook. Smash it. Maybe he's there, maybe he's just scared. Man, drive that motherfucker right up the wall. Flush that dude right out into the open, man. I can't find where the dude lives, man. Drive him right outta there, McKee. You a real sharpie, Nolan. Sharp as a tack, blazing fast, man. Yeah. Yeah, I am, huh. No fucking doubt about it. Jason! Hey, Jason Jazz! Stop, baby! Stay right there! Don't go nowhere! Baby, you're a hard man to catch up with. - So, baby, about last night. - Forget it. I didn't know. I mean, I didn't know what was coming down on you, Jason Jazz. What is coming down on me, Del'? You don't know? Hey, it ain't gonna do me no good to tell you. I know what's going down. I just wanna know what they're saying on the street. Come on. You don't wanna know it, Jason. Del', give me the lowdown. Okay, here it is. That you still be moving around, but that you're already dead. You're already dead, Jason Jazz, and hey, the cops said they ain't gonna have nothing to do with it. And Calvin Brusstar? He got a reward out for your lily white ass, sugar. - How much? - A nickel. - 5007 That's all? - 500 big ones, man! And you know every jive two rate in this town that ain't got a pot to piss in will cut your heart out for half on that! Hey, baby, you stick out like a sore thumb. You work for the Fat Man! Everybody knows you! I mean, they know where to find you at. Hey, I found you in two hours. Sugar, look. You gotta blow this town. I got a sock full of money. It ain't enough to get to Bakersfield. That's why I be telling you to hit Leon for that two-five. I thought you'd have told me to get off his back on that, Delia. Hey, sugar, that jive motherfucker. He have us working our asses off, just to pay back his gambling debts is why. Shoot, I'd be hustling every 25 jobs so that that son of a bitch can go to the racetrack and piss it away on some damn horses that can't run no faster than me. Shit, he'd be at the place right now, playing nine ball with some jive nigga that they call Gabby, 'cause he don't say much. Ain't that the pits? Three or four hours, Leon will be back here, beating on our ass for some more money. Look, baby, that's why you gotta go up there and get it before he gives it all to Gabby! Say, baby, I'm not trying to ice you or nothing, but hey, why don't you let me out in the middle of this next block up here? So don't nobody see us together. Thanks, Del'. Do me one last favor. Get out of Tony's car. The only direct friend you got is a direct line and everybody knows you'd fucking be driving it by now! - Thanks, Del'. - Ciao, baby. Fuck this jive ass shit, man. Passing the green back and forth, back and forth. Let's press the action. Talk to me, shil. Raise 10 for a dime. You must be some bad son of a bitch, man. Let's make it two dimes. Why don't y'all put that ball in your hand? You got it. You're standing right in line of my shot, asshole. I mean, what the hell do you think this is? Some penny arcade pissy white jive nickel-dime eight ball game? It's blood against blood in here, baby. Big time. Make your white ass disappear. You owe me 2,500, Leon. Pay up. You're NG, Leon. No good. Every book in town has dropped you, goddamn it. You're holding money and you owe me. I don't owe you shit, doll face motherfucker. You play, you pay, otherwise you ain't a man. You lie, you die, then it don't mean no difference if you're a man or not. Now these are my people here, Walk, so you're gonna speak the fucking truth. I'm square with the Fat Man. I don't owe nobody shit nowhere. Talk, white boy. - Sure. - Talk! You paid off the Fat Man. I don't owe nobody shit nowhere. No, you don't owe anybody anything. I ain't NG on no mother's list. You're no, no. I'm square. Pure like a baby. Yeah. I just thought maybe 'cause I knew you were holding... You just thought maybe you could get a loan, scumbag. - Yeah. - 'Cause I owed you one. - That's right. - But you came in here and fucked up like a white person, so I don't owe you shit, do I, asshole? No, you don't, Leon. We're square. Yeah. You live tonight, motherfucker. That's if Brusstar don't get your fucking ass. Run, motherfucker. Run. I said run, motherfucker! You're NG, Leon. What are you, some crazy kind of a motherfucker asshole? You know what a high hard tight one goes like, Leon? It's like this. - Is that him? - No! One more time, asshole! I told you, man. I never saw the guy before. He came in to get his car fixed. He said he'd come in in the morning. There ain't no reason for him to come in right now. The place is closed up! That's his car, Brusstar. That ain't my fucking car! I wouldn't get caught dead in a piece of shit like that! See, what's happening here, Geronimo, is that you already fucked up. What am I supposed to do, man? You got these goons all over my back, I... Shut up! We didn't come here to have our intelligence insulted. Indio. You speak with full tongue. Now we know that Jason's your best friend, so the only question I wanna know, is he coming here tonight or not? You decide and then we'll decide how long we have to wait. He's not coming. I don't know who told you I know this dude. Everybody told us. He ain't coming. He's probably not even in town anymore, man. You guys scared him. He ran away. That's what he told me he was gonna do. That's bad news for you, Geronimo. "Cause now we're gonna have to make certain. Aren't we? We're in trouble. Big trouble. Bigger than we thought. "We're", he says. We are? I'm in trouble! - I, me, not you! - Yes, Einstein. You're in trouble, but so am I! No difference! So you're out there, running around, and how do I know what you're doing? If you're even coming back, or if they'll just suddenly show up, while I'm stuck in this, this dive, like an animal! All day, the phone ringing, and that, that peeping tom! - Cooped up in here! - Shut up, lady. You're dealt a hand, you play the hand you got. You don't like it, you blow. Go away. Don't forget that I dealt you a hand, too. But maybe it's getting too hot for the little cabby! Maybe he's running scared, is that it? Lady, I'm no coward, but I'm no killer, either. For a while, there were some pretty crazy things going on in my head, but Tony was right, I was in a fog. There is no way to win this game. I am not gonna play anymore. You take your best shot, make up your own mind. Your relatives, running, the police. Il am no coward, but ll am no hero either. Wait a minute, wait a minute! You mean that's it? That you had me stay locked up here all day, when I could've been who-knows-how-far-away by now? - You asked to stay. - Instead I was going bonkers in this, this filthy place! Oh, you... You dirty son of a bitch! I gave you the best shot I could, goddamn it! If you'd have been out on the streets, you'd have been dead by now! - I was going crazy in here! - I was thinking about you all day long, - You could've called or came back! - I figured what I was doing - Let me know you were still... - Why I was doing it. - I was so worried, so scared, - None of it makes sense! - That something happened to you! - None of this makes any sense! I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Where is he? I don't know, man! Where is he? Thank you. Hello. Something's happening over at Tony's garage. - Tony? - Tony, yes! You gotta get over there, the shit's flying! Hello, Jason? Can you hear me? Jason, are you there? - Hello, Tony. - Jason! - God damn it, Tony! - It's Tony! Jason, what's happening? Oh, my god. Jason, what is it? Tony. The bastards got Tony. Goddamn you, lady. Goddamn you for being alive. I'll go with you! Go to hell. Tony! Tony! Oh, god. Oh, god! Oh, Jesus Christ. Oh, Jesus fucking... Christine? Hop in, Mick. Jesus Christ, Jason. I'm glad to see you're still alive and kicking. Hey, I heard about Tony, man. Bummer. Tell me about it. What have you heard? It's just that Brusstar's been going up and down the Strip telling everybody to watch the cabby. And to see what happens to anyone who fucks with Calvin Brusstar. And McKee? McKee's looking to cut your asshole out. And send it to the ACLU. The only thing, man, he don't remember what you look like. I'll remind him. All right, I want you to do something for me, Mick. I want you to start a rumor out there. You start it that I say that Brusstar is a puss, and if he stays in one spot, I'll find him. - Oh, man. Jesus Christ. - And Jimmy Nolan and McKee. - And anyone else that wanna get in my way. - You're talking crazy, man. You're talking worse than suicide. You're talking torture, man. Where are they, Mick? Where will I find them? Oh, shit. They're probably down at the punk's place. Hey, you know McKee and Brusstar have been pecking at each other lately because McKee don't like to be number two. So they go down there and they fucking have scenes and try to square off with one another and do all kinds of shit, man. Like they really need it, right? What happened to the woman, Micky? Oh, you don't know? She got away and Brusstar is fit to retire. She's probably in Chinatown. Yeah, man, because those Chinese don't give up their own. Hey, but you know Brusstar is probably thinking the same thing, so he's gonna send Jimmy and McKee down there to talk to that Chinese herb doctor. You know, the guy who knows everything about everything? The only thing is, McKee ain't gonna show his face down there. Not after dark. So listen, you got Nolan in one place, and you got McKee in another place. Both separate. Bingo. - Here. Go blow your brains out. - Hey, no, man. No, I'm clean, man. I've been clean for two months, look. Maybe there's some hope for you yet, Mick. Nah, there's no hope for me. Hey, but I'm clean. How about here? Yeah, this is good. Hey, Jason. I never saw you tonight, right? Like "Jason who?" - Thanks, Mick. - Take care, babe. I told you to shut that garbage off! There's no woman! What are you, slant-eyed? Stupid or what? You should be smart, like me. Save yourself a lot of grief! There's no woman! I ain't got all night, old man. You tell me where that woman is! - No woman! - Talk, old man! You gonna like that, old man? - Huh! - No! Maybe you like this! Like this better, old man, huh? I'm gonna cut your whole fucking hand off! Get your fucking... Do you know who I am? Remember who I am, huh? Say hello to hot weather, you filthy fucking scum. - Are you all right? - Ye... yes. Okay, I want you to get a message to the woman for me. Christine. You tell her that I'll meet her in front of the Pre Dawn Club between two and four tonight. I'll be there between two and four, Pre Dawn Club. Jason is my name. She'll do what she wants to do. Yes, I will. - Thank you. - 1 will. Scum, beat it. - Huh? - Get outta here. - McKee. - Huh? You're an asshole, McKee. You must be fucking bananas to come here, dipstick. You ain't got your head screwed on straight, baby. You know, goddamn it, that's true. However, a friend of mine, Geronimo, asked me to come over and say hello. Hello. What you do, man? Didn't I do it right? Got it better that time? God, I messed it up, baby. Please, can we talk about, can we talk this over? We're talking. We're talking. Hey! What's going on? Come on! Let me in! I gotta go! Come on, come on! Let me in, I gotta go! Shut the fuck up! I'm whacking off! Speak, brother. - 1 got a message for Brusstar. - Yeah, he'll be coming in here. What is it? Tell him that Jimmy and McKee said they'd meet him down at the shop on Weston. - Yeah, so is that it? - Well, something about a cab driver. I'll see that he gets the message. Say, is the music always this loud? - What? - I said, take this fucking music of yours and shove it up your kazoo. Hey, Jimmy! McKee, where are you? You in here, Jimmy? Shit! Brusstar. Where are you, you shit head? So you got McKee. You wanna play games, huh? Over here, Brusstar. You're getting warmer, Brusstar. Over here, Brusstar. That's right, Brusstar. This way. Not there, Brusstar. Hey, motherfucker, don't come in here with no motherfucking scatter gun looking for me. Heard you've been beating Gabby nine hours straight. And you're soon to be number two, motherfucker. I hear you're up 14 thou'. It ain't all mine. I got a partner. Well, then what about the 2,5007 Pay the man. Two dimes and a nickel. Comes outta your cut, man. I said pay the man! You're welcome. Hey, Jazz. Come back and shoot me some pool sometime, babe. What do we do now? Got me. Do you mind if I turn on the radio? Wanna hear some jazz? Yeah. I like jazz.
