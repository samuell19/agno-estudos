♪ ♪ [school bell rings] [upbeat pop music] [indistinct chatter] [indistinct chatter] - And that's why Shakespeare has Marcellus say to Horatio... What? Anyone? Yes, Nikki? - He says something is rotten in the state of Denmark. - Exactly right. [school bell rings] - Okay, guys. Your assignment over the weekend is to read Act III. I want you to think about what, "To be or not to be" means to you. We're going to discuss on Monday. Okay? Have a good weekend. Nikki? That was the bell. It's officially the weekend. - Sorry, Mr. Strickland. I was just trying to make sure I got down everything you were saying. - Well, I'm glad somebody wants to. Hey, have you heard from any of your colleges yet? I think acceptance letters have started going out. - Not yet, but Vanderton University's website says I should hear back any day now. - Wow. Vanderton. Are you looking to become a lawyer? - No. A doctor. My dad always wanted to be one, but never got the chance. I just want to make him proud. - Well, I'm sure he's proud of you already. You're an incredible student, Nikki. And with that drive and work ethic, I'm sure any college would be lucky to have you. - Really? I just try to make sure I'm always doing everything I can. - Well, you are. And it's paying off, right? - It is? - Yeah. I thought Principal Davis had told you. - Told me what? - Well, I'm not supposed to be the one to tell you. And they probably want to wait till grades come in before they say anything but... you're going to be named this year's valedictorian. - I am? Really? - You are. They say at this point in the year, you're so far ahead of everyone else that it would be mathematically impossible for anyone to catch you before year's end. - Oh, my God. Thank you. Oh, my God. - Thank you. - Hey, don't thank me. You're the one who did all the hard work. Just remember, you didn't hear that from me, okay? And when she tells you, try to act surprised. - Can I tell my dad? - Of course you can. Only if you take a break this weekend. You don't have to keep working yourself to death. Take some time and enjoy this. - Okay. I promise. - Congratulations, Nikki. You've earned this. [electronic music] ♪ ♪ - Dad? Oh, my God, I have the best news. Where's Mom? - Nikki, where have you been? - At school. I was in class. - You should have been home 12 minutes ago. - Well, Mr. Strickland was talking to me. Is something wrong? - Sit down. - Dad? What is it? Where's Mom? Is she home yet? - Did I do something wrong? - What? - Always stood by you. I believed in you. Yes, I was strict, but only so you'd stay focused and accomplish great things. I don't know where I went wrong. - Dad... you did everything for me. - You know, when I was your age I didn't have the same chances you had. My dad had already taken me out of school, put me to work in his shop. Told me that was my future. - Is that my acceptance letter? - No, it isn't. - No. No, no, no, no, no. This can't be right. This has to be a mistake. - There was one, Nikki. It was mine. I made the mistake in believing that you'd make something of yourself if I could just make sure to give you the chance I never had. - [breathing heavily] [suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ - It all looks to be in order here. We sent everything they asked for. - So, then what does that mean? You didn't find the mistake? - I don't think they made a mistake, Nikki. They just didn't select you. - [scoffs] Well, then of course they made a mistake. I belong there. My grades are better than anybody's, and my SATs are perfect. It's not just about the grades. A school as exclusive as Vanderton is going to be looking at a number of other factors as well. Diversity, for example. Or extracurricular commitment. Or recommendations from alumni. Especially if it's a parent. - But that's not fair. - It's just the way that it is there. Legacy enrolments at Vanderton make up a third of all incoming freshmen. - So they're shutting me out because I have the wrong father. - Nikki, it's not personal. - It's my future, Jan. It couldn't be more personal. - You're right. I'm sorry. I just mean to say you are not alone, all right? In total, I had seven very strong and qualified applicants for Vanderton this year, all with great SATs. All with straight A's. And the only one that Vanderton gave a place to was also a legacy applicant. - So somebody did get in. Who? [soft dramatic music] ♪ ♪ - Mom, I am not bringing Professor Snuggles to college. - I wouldn't embarrass you like that. - Not on day one, no, but I could totally see you bringing him to parents' night, just to torture me. Hey, how cold does it get there? - In Boston? - Yeah. Am I going to need coats, or is it like scarves, hats and gloves too? - Oh, you're going to need everything. I mean, yes, you will study by fireplaces and drink hot cocoa and all that wonderful, charming stuff. But fall finals is right in the middle of blizzard season. You're going to have to be prepared. In fact, I have just the thing. I think this is going to fit you, and it's totally back in style. - Mom, I can't take your coat. - Nonsense. This was grandma's originally, and she wore it when she went to Vanderton. And then I wore it when I was there. And now seeing that you're going to be the third generation of Allen women to go to the school, I know she'd want you to take it with you, so she could be with you always to keep you warm. - It's perfect. [laughs] - Just like you, kiddo. [sighs] Are you sure you don't want to leave something to wear for when you come back? - Mom... are you sure you're going to be okay here without me? - Of course I am. Why would you worry about me? - Because this is a really big house for just one person. Mom, especially with the hours you work. I just wish that someone was here to be with you. - Lace... - I know, I know. I'm not saying that's Tom. I mean, that'd be awesome. But it could be like a student or something. Someone to be here and water the plants and keep you company and stuff. - I'm going to be okay. And the only thing you have to worry about is making sure you have the time of your life. Let's finish packing. Ginger's going to be here any minute. [doorbell rings] - Too late. - Well, it could be Tom. He said he was heading over to say goodbye. [doorbell ringing incessantly] - [laughs] - Okay then. I guess it's Ginger. - I wonder what my roommate will be like. - Oh, yeah. - Should be great. Everything's going to be great. Your sweaters and sweatshirts are in the bin. - Okay. - I packed you guys some snacks for the car. Ones you like. Check the gas. And oh, my gosh, I think that should do it. - [sighs] - I really hope we don't need anything out of there. - All my clothes are back there. - You guys are going to figure it out. - [sighs] It's going to be fine, Mom. We're going to drive safe. We're going to be careful. And I'm only a phone call away, okay? - I just wish I was going with you. - Mom, you have lives to safe. That's so much more important. And besides, this might be the last full week I get to spend with Ginger. Ah! - Hey! Yeah, boring me. Going to college in town. - Ginger, when you get back, at least you'd better come see me. - Ooh, he made it! - Hey! - Close. - Sorry. Sorry I'm late. Vanderton! [laughs] Can you believe it? - Just barely. - They're lucky to have you. - Thanks, Tom. - I mean that. - Take care of my mom, all right? - Who, this one? - Are you kidding? I'm going to be taking care of him. Now come here. - Bye. - I'm going to miss you so much. - I know, Mom. - Be careful. - Think about what I said, all right? - I will. Okay, I love you. - [laughs] - Drive safe, you guys. - Bye! - Bye. - Be careful. - Everything is just so easy for you. Isn't it? - Oh, my gosh. She's gone. - Yeah, but she'll be back before you know it. Come on, I'll make you dinner. So, what do you feel like tonight? - You decide. - See you around, doc. - Are you okay. - Yeah, I just can't believe she's gone, just like that. [sighs] I've known today was coming for months, even years. And somehow, it still managed to sneak up on me. - Well, you do know she's going to be okay, right? - Yeah. It's funny, she told me she was actually more worried about me. - About you? - Yeah, she thinks this house is too big for me to be in all by myself. She suggested that I rent a room to a local kid at community college to keep me company. - You don't sound too crazy about that idea. - Yeah, I don't know. We'll see how it goes. - Well, it wouldn't necessarily have to be a stranger. [wine pouring] - Huh? - If you want somebody to move in. It could also be someone you already know. - Oh, Tom, I think one big life change is already more than enough for me to deal with today. I'm sorry. We'll get there. There's just a really big difference between-- - No, it's okay. It's okay. I get it. I shouldn't have sprung that on you. Especially not today. Like some more? - Are you sure you don't want to stay? - Well, I shouldn't. I got double surgery scheduled in the morning, and some of my notes are at home. Is that okay? I could wake up early if you'd prefer I stay. - It's okay. I promise. So I'll see you at work tomorrow. - All right. Good night, doc. - I love you. - I love you too. - [sighs] - [sighs] God.

Good morning, Dr. Allen. Here goes nothing. [screams] [panting] [screams] [siren wailing] - Doctor, how is she? - Your daughter's going to be fine, Mrs. Lee. - She is? - Yes. We safely removed her appendix. Her vitals are normal. Yes, she's going to be tired for the next few weeks and need to take it easy, but soon she'll be back to her normal self. - Okay. - Also, I'd like you to bring her in for a follow-up appointment next week. In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to call, day or night. - Thank you so much. - That's what I'm here for. - Hey, doc, would you mind taking a look at the patient in Room 2? I was going to put her with Dr. Brown, but she asked to be seen by a woman. - No problem. - Thanks. [cell phone chimes] Good morning. I'm Dr. Allen. How are you? - Not so good. - Oh, that looks like it hurts. - I think it's broken. - Well, we'll find out for sure. What's your name? - Melissa. Melissa Waters. - Hi, Melissa. I'm Carol. We haven't met before? - Oh, no. I don't think so. - Okay. Let's take a look. How did this happen? - I fell. I was running down a flight of stairs, and I guess I wasn't looking or something, and I fell. - You fell right on it, huh? - Yeah. - That's not good. Can you feel me doing that? - Yeah. - Does it hurt? - Not the way my wrist does, no. - Okay, I'm just going to feel around to a few spots. Make sure you haven't done any damage to the nerves. - So cool that you know how to do all that. - [laughs] Well, if you want to learn, the world could always use a few more doctors. - Yeah. My dad used to say that. - He's a smart man. Do you think about it? - I used to. - Yeah? - Yeah. I used to think about it every single day. - What made you change your mind? - Aah! - Oh! I'm going to give you something for the pain. I just want to make sure I know all the spots it hurts first. Do me a favor. Try and make a fist. Hmm. Okay, great. I have some good news. I don't think you've broken it. - I didn't? - We'll get an X-ray for sure, but it looks like just a sprain. - Oh. Is that going to be expensive? - Well, do you have insurance? Oh. Don't worry about it. - Really? - Yeah, it's fine. Let's go get that X-ray. Come on. Be careful, and let me get the door for you. - Huh. - Dr. Allen. Melissa's X-rays are ready. - Thank you. - Yup. Hey, did I talk to you about... - Okay. - Wow, is that my hand? - Yeah, you want to take a look? - It's smashed to pieces. - Actually, it's supposed to look like that. - It is? - Your wrist is made up of a group of eight small bones, called the carpal bones, and they all work together to help your hand to have its full range of movement. - Oh. And they're all okay? - 100%. You have a sprain, young lady. - So I won't need a cast? - Just a sling for a few weeks until you're all better. I just don't think you'll need anything more restrictive than that. - Great. - So are your parents upstairs? Shall we go tell them you'll be okay? - No. Um... my parents are dead. - Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry. - No, it's okay. It happened when I was young. They were on their way back from a dinner party, and I guess so was a drunk driver. - That's terrible. - Yeah. I didn't have any other family, so they put me into foster care, and I was raised by the state. - So you didn't have foster parents? - They tried putting me into a couple homes, but I guess nobody ever liked me enough to keep me. Then last week, when I turned 18, the state just said, "Good luck, peace out." Then I was on my own. - So, where are you living? - Actually, that's what I'm trying to figure out right now. I need to get a job and a cheap place to live, but I guess now I have to deal with this too. - You know... I was thinking about renting out a room. - What, you mean like at your place? - Yeah. My daughter just left for college, and I'm all alone in this really big house. And it would be a shame not to have someone else enjoy it with me. - Oh, that sounds really nice, but I don't think I could afford that. - Yeah, you can. Because I wouldn't charge you anything. I would ask you to run a few errands, do some chores around the house, and then we could call it even. - Why would you do that for me? - Because I have a really good feeling about you. And I want to make sure you have the chance you need. And I'm not going to take no for an answer. - Well, then I guess I'd better say yes. - So you're having her move in with you? - Just for a little while, till she gets her feet on the ground. - That seems awfully impulsive. What happened to not wanting to make any other big life changes? - Tom... - Yeah, I'm just saying. What do you even know about this girl? - I know she's got nowhere else to go. Look, I understand it sounds crazy. I was shocked the instant the words came out of my mouth too. But there is something about this girl. Her story is touching and tragic. Think about it. She's the same age as Lacey, and she's got nothing. It is a good thing. When you meet her, you'll see. - Hey. I need to go across town. 1-8-7-5-4. - Melissa. - Hi, Dr. Allen. - If you're gonna stay with me, you have to call me Carol. - Okay, Carol. - Come on in. Let me help you with that. - Oh, it's fine. I got it. - No, no. Doctor's orders. - Okay, then. - What a beautiful flower. - I'm glad you think so. I got it for you. - [laughs] Thanks. I love orchids. Let me just put them down. And then I'd love to show you the place. Why don't you follow me upstairs. My bedroom is at the top of the stairs here on the left. You'll be all the way at the end of the hall. There's a bathroom here you're free to use. - This place is incredible. - You like it? - I've never seen anything like it. Is this your daughter's room? - Yeah. Actually, if you don't mind, I'd like to consider this room off-limits. - Oh, she didn't leave much behind. I'm sorry. - No, it's fine. She's just been gone a few days. I'm still getting used to it. - No, I understand. Where does she go? - She started college at Vanderton. - Wow. Vanderton. You must be proud. - I am. - You know, I used to dream of going there and studying medicine, just like my father always wanted. It's so cool that your daughter gets to go there and follow in her mother's footsteps like that. - Yeah, it is. How did you know that I went to Vanderton? - Oh. I... I looked you up on the Internet. This all just seemed too good to be true, so I wanted to check things out before I got my hopes up. I'm sorry. - I guess there aren't any secret anymore. Come on. - This is amazing. Thank you. - Of course. I'm glad to have you. So, why don't we talk about chores and everything else tomorrow? Take tonight to relax, settle in. And if you need anything, just let me know. - Thank you. [sighs] [groans] [clears throat] [pills rattle] [sighs] [phone rings] - Hello? - Holding up okay without me? - Lace, honey, how's everything? Are classes okay? - Mom, this place is amazing. The teachers are so smart. Everybody is. It's just so different than high school. It's like anytime anybody here talks, it's to say something insightful and articulate. I know it's only the first day, but I feel like I've already learned so much. - That's so great to hear. How's your roommate? - Actually, I don't have one yet. There was an error or something, so since the bed's empty, Ginger decided to move her flight and stay another week! - Hi, Miss A! - She says hi. - Yeah, I heard. - Now tell me about you. Are you doing okay? You know I'm still worried about you in that house all alone. - Well, actually, maybe you don't have to worry anymore. - What? Why? What's going on? - Maybe I took your advice. - You rented a room? - Well, I wasn't going to, but I met a girl around your age today in the exam room, and... I don't know, it just felt right. She's got so much potential, and she could go so far. She just needs a fair shot. - That's great, Mom. You should bring her to parents' weekend. I bet she'd get a lot out of a chance to walk around the campus. - That's not a bad idea. - I should probably get to bed. I have 8:30 class in the morning. - Okay. Well, enjoy it. And keep calling me with these updates, okay? - Okay, Mom. I love you. - I love you too. [dial tone buzzes] beeping] [sighs] [sizzling] Is she making breakfast? Oh, my goodness. - Dr. Allen, good morning. I'm making breakfast, if you have time to eat. - Uh, yeah. I'll make time, thank you. And call me Carol. - Right. Sorry. I'm still getting used to that. - Did you clean too? - Oh, just a bit. We hadn't discussed chores yet, but I figured this was a good way to start pitching in. - Yeah, if you want to just keep doing that, getting things done wherever you see they're needed. That will be more than enough. - Really? That'll cover my rent? - Absolutely. - Then you got yourself a deal... Carol. Now, take a seat. Your breakfast is coming right up, and your coffee's getting cold. - You made coffee too? - Of course. - You'd better be careful, Melissa. I may never let you leave. If you have any questions, if you need anything, don't hesitate to call. - Okay. Have a good day. - I will. You too. [car starts] [sighs] [scoffs] [sighs] [breathing heavily] I gave up everything. What did you give up? [cell phone rings] Dad? - Nikki, it's your mom. - [sighs] Why are you calling me? - I'm calling because I miss you. We both do. - You do? Both of you? - Of course, sweetie. Neither of us wanted you to leave like that. - Dad did. - Your dad didn't know what he wanted, okay? Why don't you just come home tonight and see us, huh? I'm making lamb chops. I know it's your favorite. - Mom. - Yes, sweetie? - Does Dad know that you're inviting me to come back home? - Uh, Nikki... - Mom, answer the question. Does he? [breathing heavily] - Morning, Jean. - Dr. Allen. How's that houseguest working out for you? - Like a dream. - Mm. - Someone new in your life? - Actually, those are for you. - They are? - Yes, ma'am. Dr. Kimbler dropped them for you this morning. - "I'm sorry for yesterday. "I should never have doubted your judgment. I love you." [dialing] [phone line rings] - You've reached Dr. Thomas Kimbler. Please leave a message. [answering machine beeps] - Hey, it's me. I got your flowers. That was really sweet. Thank you. Give me a call. I would love to see you. Maybe we can grab dinner tonight. Let me know. [phone beeps off] - [sighs] There. That's better. [vehicle approaching] [vehicle driving away] Bills. Bills. Ooh. What's this? - Dr. Allen? - Yes, I'm still here. - Great, we're just about finished here. I just need to get your birth date one more time and the last four digits of your social. And then I need to ask you a series of randomized questions to verify your identity. - Yes, of course. I was born on 7/26/76. And the last four digits of my social are 4232. - Wonderful, thank you. Now, please note that the following questions have all been compiled entirely from public records to produce questions to which only you will know the answer. - I'm ready when you are. [sighs] She wouldn't use her social, would she? 4232. Okay, Carol. Let's see what you're looking to buy today. Hmm. A big-screen plasma TV with all the specs. Well, why not. Hmm. Didn't you want that $2,000 dual-boil espresso machine? Let's just get it to be sure. You know what you need, Carol? Five more iPads and a high-end sound system. Hmm. A massage chair with zero gravity. Because... why not? [sighs] - Excuse me. - Carol. - Tom, hi. Did you get my message? - I did. And I'd love to have dinner with you tonight. - Great. - Listen, I'm sorry about yesterday. I should have never questioned your decision. - No, I'm sorry. I want us to have the kind of relationship where we can talk about concerns like that. - I agree. I was just a little worried, that's all. So, how's she doing so far? - She's amazing. She made me breakfast this morning, and somehow she managed to clean my entire kitchen before I even woke up. All with only one good hand. - That's great. - She just has that ambition, you know? - I can't wait to meet her. - So I have an idea. Why don't you drive tonight. - You want to leave your car here? - No, you can follow me home. We can leave from there. That way, you can come in and say a quick hi before we go. - That sounds great. - Great. Melissa? - Is she cooking? - It smells great. - Amazing. - [gasps] - Didn't mean to scare you. - Totally my fault. Hi, I'm Melissa. You must be Tom. - Yes, I am. Nice to meet you. - So, what's going on? Are you expecting company? - Oh. No. It was for you. I thought you'd think it was nice to come home to find dinner ready. - I do. I just wish I would have known. We were planning on going out. - Actually, Carol, I could cancel our reservation. - Really? I made more than enough food for all of us. - You wouldn't mind? - No, not at all. It'd be crazy to go wait at a restaurant when we have all this gourmet food being made right here at home. So, Melissa, Carol tells me you had an interest in medicine. - Uh, yes. Have. - I'm sorry? - You said "had." I still have an interest. Things just haven't really worked out that way. - Well, have you looked into schools? - Uh, I have. I used to want to go to Vanderton, like Carol and her daughter. But I don't have the right connections. - Well, getting into Vanderton isn't about connections. It's about your grades. - No, it isn't. - Well, what do I know? [laughs] I went to San Diego State. - For medicine? - No, for everything else to keep my grades up. I went to UCLA for medicine. - And he's a great doctor. [laughs] A person's education doesn't define them. We're measured by what we do. - How is it? Does it look okay? - Yeah, I think it looks great. - It does? - Yeah. The swelling's gone down. It looks like you've regained some strength. Why don't you grab my arm with your hand. Can you do that? - Okay. - Good. And apply some pressure. And keep applying more until you feel it hurt. Hey, that's pretty good. Okay, you can stop. Okay, Mel-Melissa. - Oh, my gosh. I'm so sorry. I didn't hurt you, did I? - No, it's fine. So just keep wearing the sling, take it easy, and in a few days you'll be as good as new. - What was that about? How are you? You okay? - Yeah. It's going to bruise a little. I'll be fine. I don't think she meant to hurt me. - Yeah. I think that she is a girl who has had it very hard for a very long time. And I think she's used to having to prove herself. - I think you're probably right. She's a good kid, Tom. - Yeah, I can see that. I think she has tremendous potential. And with you in her corner, she no longer has to be afraid to fail. - Thank you. - Hey, I mean that. I think she's great, and I think you are exactly what she's needed her whole life. - Melissa, good morning. - Good morning. Where's Tom? - He's still sleeping. He has the next few days off, so I thought I'd let him rest. - Carol, I'm so sorry about what happened last night. - No, don't worry about it. - It's just really embarrassing for me, because I planned the whole thing and made you dinner because I wanted to ask you a big favor. Now I feel like I've blown it. - No. I still think you're great. What did you want to ask? - Well, um, I wanted to ask if I could come to work with you one day, to shadow you while you work. - Really? That's it? - Yeah. I promise to stay out of your way and not to ask too many questions. And I'll make sure I still get all my chores done around here. I just wanted to see what it's like to be you for a day. - I think it's a great idea. Why don't we do it today. - Really? - Yeah. Well, you're not a med student, so I have to get approval. But why don't you go upstairs and get changed, and I'll make the call. - Thanks so much for making this happen, Carol. - Of course. This is the patient board that tell us who's doing what. Anytime someone comes in, they wait out there. The nurse comes to get them, brings them to the exam room, gets some information. And then they come and they put their name in the column for whichever doctor has a slot. - Okay. - I hope you're getting that, dear, because that's the most important part of the job right there. - That's Jean. Jean's the head nurse. Jean's in charge of this board. Lesson number one: always be friends with Jean. - I'll be sure to do that. - Well, you'd better. I'm the reason you two met. - Let's get to work. - [inhales and exhales] - Okay, well, it does seem as though you have a bit of an infection. I'm going to prescribe a round of antibiotics, but I really need you to get a lot of rest. - Doctor, will that be amoxicillin? - Yes, Melissa. That's right. See the crack there? That's a fracture to the tibial shaft. We'll tell him to stay off his leg for a month, or risk a full break. - What's that down there? Is that an old break? - Yes, it is. Very good, Melissa. I'm going to keep you here overnight for observation. I'll do a chest X-ray and a few other tests. If all goes well, tomorrow morning I'll have you released, and then I'd love you to come in for about a follow-up appointment in about a week or so. But I think you're going to be fine, okay? Just a precaution. Not to worry. So as you can see, there's nothing better than building a bond and trust with your patients. This job is so rewarding. At the same time, it's a little challenging on your personal life. - [laughs] In what ways? - Well, I'm on call 24/7. Not easy to do when you're raising a child. You were really impressive today, Melissa. If you're serious about this, I think you have a really big future ahead of you. - Really? You think so? - Absolutely. Now we just have to see about putting you in a community college to get you started-- - Carol, can you come here for a minute, please? - Sure, what's up? - This gentleman said that you asked for some items to be shipped here? - What? - I just need a signature, if you wouldn't mind. - What items? I didn't order that. - You're Carol Allen, aren't you? Billing address on Parkwell Avenue? - Yes. Look, that has to go. It has to be out of here right now. Just take it and leave. This is obviously some sort of a mistake. I have no idea what any of this is. - Here comes the rest. - The rest? What are you...? Oh, my God. Sir, stop. - Carol, you have got to get all this out of here. - I didn't order this. Excuse me, this has to go. [door closes] Yes, but, sir, you got to get that out. That can't stay here. - The invoice says to deliver it to the front desk. - I don't care. The invoice is wrong. You need to clear this hallway. I didn't order this. - Be happy to move it anywhere you want. - It's not mine, okay? If you don't take this stuff away, I'm calling security. This is really embarrassing. - Carol, it does look like this invoice is in order here. I think somebody's stolen your identity. - Still waiting on that signature, ladies. - Carol, go. I can handle this. - Are you sure? - Absolutely. Look, don't worry. I'll be sure everything gets returned, okay? - Okay, thanks, Melissa. I need you on this, Jean. Let's go, quick. - Hey, get all this crap out of here, okay? - Ma'am, it's not that simple. - Well, today it's going to be. None of this is staying here, and I'm not signing a damn thing. - Come on, boys, let's get it all back on the truck. All right, Carol. Let's see what else you want to buy. - [sighs] Thank you, Carol. This is so nice of you. [knock on door] Carol, you're home early. - Yeah, not for long. I'm going to meet Tom for dinner. I just wanted to know what happened with those deliveries. - Oh, it's fine. I called up and found out that the card that was used was activated yesterday. - Yesterday? That doesn't make any sense. - Yeah, exactly. So I reported it as an error and insisted it be frozen immediately. They said they would, so you have nothing to worry about. - Okay. Thank you, Melissa. - Hey, that's what I'm here for. Now, go get ready. You have a date. [sighs] - Shoot. [knock on door] - Is everything okay? I thought you were heading out. - Melissa, Lacey's door was cracked open. Would you happen to know why that would be? - You said to consider that room off-limits, so I've been avoiding it. Is everything okay? - Yeah. Lacey framed her acceptance letter from Vanderton, and it was on a table next to her bed, and now it's gone. - I'm sorry, but I haven't seen it. Is it possible she took it with her, maybe? What would anybody else even want with that? - [sighs] Yeah, maybe you're right. I'm sorry. - It's okay. Go have fun. - I will. Thanks. I'll see you later. - Later. - [sighs] [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ [gasps] [sighs] [cell phone chimes] [keys rattle] - Melissa? It's Tom. Are you ready? - Just a minute. Hello, Tom. - Hey, Melissa. Why are you so dressed up? What are you doing? - Don't you like the way I look? I thought we could stay in. - What? - I think we both knew there was an attraction as soon as we met. - Um... Melissa, I don't know what you're talking about. I don't know what you expect-- Stop, just stop. Stop. - Wait. - I can't believe this. - Wait, Tom! I'm sorry! [door opens] I made a mistake. [shrieks] [sobbing] - Melissa. What's wrong? Melissa. - Oh, it's nothing. [sniffling] - You can tell me, okay? - I can't tell you. - Of course you can. Oh, my God, who did this to you? - [sighs] It was Tom. - My Tom? No. No, he would never do that. - I didn't want to have to tell you. I just wanted to ask him questions about orthopedics. But when he showed up... it was clear he had been drinking. - Tom had been drinking? - Yeah. And then he started hitting on me and suggesting things. And when I said no, he got mad. Really mad. And then I tried to push him off me, but then he just pushed back harder. [sniffles and sobs] And then I guess he realized that he hurt me, because he started apologizing and begging me not to ever tell you. I didn't want to have to tell you, but you've been so wonderful to me. I thought you deserved to. [cell phone rings] - Oh, my God. It's Tom. - [sighs] - He can wait. - [sniffles] - Yeah, Carol, please call me when you get this. I, uh... I need to speak to you about something that happened this evening. [cell phone rings] - Dr. Allen. - Carol, it's Jean. Carol, I'm calling because we just lost Mr. Terrod in the ICU. - He was recovering. He was going to be fine. - He should have been. Yes. But it seems there was a change made to his medication. - Change? - Well, he was taken off of his blood thinners and put on a painkiller instead. So his arteries clotted, and he couldn't feel it to let us know anything was wrong. - Well, who signed off on that? - [sighs] Well, you did. Your initials are on the chart. - I'm coming in. - There is nothing that can be done about it right now. - I have to see that for myself. - Carol-- - I want you to show me. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hang on. - Who are they? - They came for the files. The doctor in the ER who caught the change is alleging malpractice. - What? - They have to do an investigation. Here, I made you a copy. - I don't understand. It looks like my handwriting. But I didn't do it. - Well, somebody did. - What? Mom, how can that be? You don't make mistakes like that. - I don't know. It doesn't make any sense. I didn't think I did either, but it was clearly my handwriting. And now they want me to wait here and answer a bunch of questions while they look over everything. - Well, is Tom there with you at least? Mom? - Tom and I need to have a talk. - What? Why? What happened? - Well, I don't know. When I got home earlier, Melissa was sitting there crying, and her shirt was ripped, and she had a bruise on her neck. - Oh, my gosh. What-- - At first she didn't want to say what happened, but then when she finally did, she said it was Tom. - What? - I guess he had a few drinks before coming over, and then he started coming onto her, and he got mad. when she said no. - Did you talk to Tom? - No. I haven't had a chance yet. - Mom, that does not sound like Tom. He loves you, like, to the degree that I don't think he's ever noticed another woman in his life. Why would you just take this girl's word at face value? - Because I could clearly see that she had been attacked. Besides, why would someone make something like that up? You ready for me? All right, sweetie. I got to go. I love you. - Okay, I love you too. [phone beeps off] [sighs] [dials] [phone line rings] - Missing me already? - More than you know. Hey, Ginger, could you do me a favor tomorrow? - Well, that all depends on the favor. - Could you go by my house and check in on my mom? - Oh, yeah, sure. I was planning on heading over there anyway. Wait, why? Is something wrong? - I don't think so, but I'd love if you could just check in on her and let me know for sure. Try to meet her tenant, if you can. See if she seems all right to you. - Hey, you got it. You just worry about Vanderton things, and I'll manage the rest. - Thanks. I owe you one. - Yes, you do. Bye. [phone beeps off] [doorbell rings] - Hello? [doorbell ringing rapidly] Anybody home? Hello? Carol? Carol? Oh. - Can I help you? - Sorry, I didn't think anyone else was here. I'm Ginger. I'm a friend of Carol's. - She's not here right now. - Oh. I know. She's going to be back any minute. She just wanted me to wait inside. Have we met before? - No, you haven't. I'm Melissa. - No. No, you're not. - Ginger... - No, you're Nikki Stone. You're the one who's living here? What are you doing? - Ginger, just walk away. - No. No, I have to tell Lacey. - Ginger, give me the phone! - No. - Ha! [panting] - Ginger? Ginger? - Are you looking for somebody? - Yeah, have you seen Ginger? A cute young girl around your are? - I haven't seen anybody, no. Certainly not inside. - Well, she texted me and said that she was pulling up, and that she'd wait for me. I told her she could wait inside. - Maybe she came in when I went out for a walk. - No, if she had she would have used Lacey's spare key. Let me check on her. - Well, in the meantime, do you want to go for lunch or something? - [sighs] No, I'm not in the mood. - Maybe we could go to a movie or something. - No, Melissa. I'm sorry, I lost a patient last night. - Oh, no. I'm sorry. What happened? - I don't know what happened. Apparently it was something I did. A mistake I made. A change in the medication. I don't even remember doing it. - That's terrible. Are you going to be okay? - Well, I won't know until the hospital finishes their internal investigation. But right now I'm on cautionary suspension. I just have to wait and see. - You know what? I'm going to make you dinner again tonight. Just to help take your mind off things. - No, thanks. - Well, I know you're upset, but you still have to eat. - I have plans. - You do? - I'm meeting Tom for dinner. - What? No, no, no, no. I don't want to see him, not after what he did to me. I don't want him here. - I'm not bringing him here. It's not like that. I just... I need to meet with him and hear his side of things. - So then you don't believe me? - Of course I do. I just-- I have to sit down with him and make him account for his actions. - Okay. I understand. But where are you going? I would just feel better if I knew. - We're just going to some deli on Harbor. I'll be fine. I... I won't be long. - Okay. Just be careful. I'm going to head out for a little bit then, just to give you some space. - Thank you. [phone line rings] - Hi, it's Ginger. Leave me a message. [answering machine beeps] - Hey, it's Lace. What's up? I haven't heard from you yet. Call me. [engine idling] [loud thump] - [gasps] [phone rings] - Hi, Jean. - Tom's been admitted to the ICU. - Wait. What about Tom? [dings] Where is he, Jean? - Carol... - What room? - I'm sorry, Carol, when they found out that he was here, they called and told me I couldn't let you in the room. - What? - With the investigation and everything, they think you'll be a distracting presence in the ER. But they did say that when he's in recovery, I can let you see him as long as you're accompanied by an escort. - An escort? To see my boyfriend? - I'm sorry, Carol. They're watching me too, to make sure I don't do you any favors. Now, I'm going to have to ask you to step outside. But if you leave your phone on, I'll text you updates, okay? - Thanks, Jean. Hi, Lace. - Hey, have you seen Ginger today? I haven't heard from her. Uh, no, she never came by. - She texted me that she pulled up, and she said she was there. - She must have left. - Mom, are you okay? What's wrong? [sighs] Sweetie, Tom's been in an accident. - What? - Yeah, it was a hit and run. He was on his way to see me and someone ran him down. - Is he going to be okay? - I don't know. I hope so. They won't let me see him because of my suspension. - Suspension? Mom, I'm flying home. - No, Lacey, I want you to focus on your classes. I'll feel so much better if I know you're at school. Lacey, please. - Okay. But if anything else happens, I'm booking the first flight home. All right? I love you, Mom. - I love you too. I'll keep you posted. Bye. [phone beeps off] [sighs] [cell phone chimes] [cell phone chimes] - Oh, my God. [cell phone chimes] [cell phone chimes] - [sighs] [phone line rings] - Hi, you've reached Ginger Varton. I'm unabl-- [phone beeps off] [cell phone chimes] - Hey, sir, I'm sorry, but can we change our destination? [cell phone chimes] - See you real soon, Lacey. - He's awake. - Is he okay? - He's stable, and he's asking for you. Come on, I can take you to see him. - [sighs] Okay. - Mom? Mom? Mom? [screams] Ginger? No, no, no, no, no. Ginger. Oh, my God. Ginger, wake up. Wake up! - That won't work. - Nikki? What are you doing here? - I came for you, Lacey. - Did you do this to Ginger? - Yeah, I did. Yeah, I killed her. But don't worry. You'll be joining her soon enough. - He's going to be right in here. Wait here one second. Doctor, he has a visitor that would like to meet with him for 15, 20 minutes, just briefly. Would that be okay? - Yeah, that should be fine. - [sighs] - Great. Thank you. Carol? You can come in now. - Oh, Tom. I've been so worried. - Melissa. - You can tell me after. Just rest. - Carol... Melissa... isn't Melissa. - What? - I called foster services. They have no record of Melissa Waters being released. - I don't understand. - She's the one... who did this to me. - Oh, my God. Lacey. - Lacey? - [Lacey sobbing] - Oh, my God. Lacey. My God. Honey. Okay, okay. Shh. Okay, hold on. Hold on one second. Okay, okay. Is she still here? - She's over there. - That's enough, Carol. - Melissa, what are you doing? - Mom, she killed Ginger! - Oh, my God. Why are you doing this? What's going on? - I'm doing what's right. - What are you talking about? - Tell her who I am, Lacey. - You know who she is? - She's Nikki Stone. She went to my school. - That's right. I was the valedictorian. I would have been the one who got into Vanderton if you hadn't stolen my spot and given it to Lacey. - What? - The legacy admission, Carol. [laughs] Forget about the girl with nothing who did it all on her own, who worked for every single thing she ever had. You robbed me of my future, Carol. Not just that, but also the love of my father, who will never approve of me now. But that's just fine, because now I'm going to make things right. - Look, Melissa-- - Call me Nikki, Carol. - Nikki, put the gun down. - Shut up! You don't get it, Carol. You don't understand. You can't talk me down from this or throw money at it. This is something I earned, and you stole it from me. - Lacey earned it. - No, she didn't! Lacey has friends. She took time to do other things, to have hobbies, okay? She didn't want it as much as I did. But I guess she didn't have to, because people like you have the whole entire game rigged. Don't you? - Hey! - [both grunting] - Aah! - [both panting] - Give me the gun, Lacey! - Give me the gun! - Goddamn it! [gunshot] - Lacey! Oh, my God. Call 911. [dials] [phone line rings] - 911, what's your emergency? - Yes, yes, it's 410 Parkwell Avenue. - Have them get in touch with County General. Have two pints of O negative and a trauma team ready. - Okay. Two pints of O negative and a trauma team ready, please. - Help. - Yeah, my mom is a doctor. - [gasps] Am I going to make it? - The ambulance is on its way. Hey, we're going to be okay.
