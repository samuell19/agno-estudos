The city of Hebron. At its heart lies the burial site of Abraham, the common father of Jews, Muslims and Christians. Above his grave, an ancient shrine, variously known as the Tomb of the Patriarchs, the Cave of Machpelah, or the Ibrahimi Mosque. Its many names reflect competing claims for ownership of this holy place, claims which make Hebron the most divided city in the West Bank. A small area, also inhabited by Palestinians, is under direct Israeli control. Within it is an enclave of 800 religious Jews known as settlers their goal is to rebuild Hebron's ancient Jewish community This 2-part series is about life in this enclave, the everyday experience of Palestinians and settlers, communities united only by their mutual hostility. First, the world of the Jewish settlers. Welcome to the homes of Rachel and Leah Visit these salvaged homes Last week the government gave us permits... for this historic siite To redeem the city of Hebron Stop by Make a single donation now Or direct debit Help us redeem this city With God’s and your help What do these buses mean? What do they mean? If there's so many buses, what does it mean? Okay, but it also means that people are coming from all over Eretz Israel to Hebron, right? Because they know that Hebron... it's not just a few people who care about it, this whole nation cares about it, and what we're going to do one day is we're going to make this town more beautiful. We're going to take all these beautiful old buildings and make them beautiful again, make them useful again. Sometimes people don't really like the media, because they're used to the media showing Israel in a way that we don't see ourselves. But, hopefully, there'll be some good people manning the cameras who will tell the truth, or at least share our truth, right? You see this thing, it's called a checkpoint, they just make sure that the Arabs that come in here don't come in with any weapons or anything like that, look, see, this nice Arab is walking through here, okay, he's been checked, he doesn't have any weapons, and it also, sadly, means that we can't go to that part of Hebron, we can't get into 97% of Hebron. 97% of Hebron, off limits to us today, OK? So we only have... 3... We live in 3% of this town that we've lived in for 3,800 years. OK? And this checkpoint, the world wants to make it look like this is a checkpoint that's anti-Arab. But the truth is it's just a security checkpoint, Arabs are treated with respect here, they come in so they don't hurt us. Sadly, we cannot go to walk in Hebron. Why? -Just because we're Jewish. Respect Anottoer one God bless. How are you? Give it here Sticker for your car, Israel? Car sticker See her? She spat on my car Why are you filming the settler Ofer? Ofer, what are you doing by the Ibrahimi Mosque? I'm so happy, Oh God This land is ours Everything's ours Even that house is ours I want to introduce a friend A man of Hebron Noam Amon He’ll welcome us to the city of our fathers Every Jew, from any ethnic group, with different opinions, colours, groups, all feel the connection to their roots Friends, take this mission Carry it forward In your educational work, in all your branches, all oveidihe country ansi globally Take this truth, this link, this holiness, this unique quality around the world Spread the light, be brave. be strong, God is with you Hebron is a very special city. I can be here in my kitchen, washing dishes, and see from the window, like a television, everything that's going on here, and I can see the Arabs when they're throwing rocks, I can see them from the roof, and I can film them, and you can imagine that at the same time, when the Arabs made all these violent attacks, in the neighbourhood here, in the Jewish community, because we have the army to protect us, we have a regular life, you can see tourists, you can see children playing, you can see normal, regular life, but from the window you can see a crazy story, it's like television! There's people that are pushing them to do it, you can see they're putting now dirt on the street to make fire. If you don't believe the Jews have the right to be here... so, the anger that we exist... but I think it's the result of education, they're teaching them that there's no way to live together with us, the Jews shouldn't be here, and this is not good, not for them, and not for us. We took a course, a few people here, that were willing to start taking pictures, to film what is going on around. This is part of the war, it's not only guns and killing, it's a war about what people will think, and maybe the people in the world will understand that the story is not like what they think. Wait, what were you talking about in the beginning? Propaganda? -Propaganda. There's two wars here. If you guys right here, I know that all of you are going to be soldiers next year, and I'm proud of you, really, God bless you. And I salute you, that's going to be great, OK? But even if you're not going to be soldiers next year, you're going to be part of the propaganda war, what I call the narrative war. You're going to have to tell this story, and this building is a story. That's why I keep on wanting you guys to remember the dates and understand the truth, because you're going to be asked, somebody's going to say, "you're an occupier, you're a foreigner in this building." You going to be able to answer him? Good. Solid. OK. The 2000 year old Tomb of the Patriarchs is the second holiest Jewish site in the world. It marks the grave of Abraham, his wife Sarah, and other biblical ancestors. For 700 years under Muslim rule, Jews were restricted to worshiping here at this corner. Only after Israel captured the city in the Six Day War could they again pray inside the tomb. Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, Sarah Rebecca and Leah, Adam and Eve are buried here, here is the entrance to Heaven. This is where all the prayers from all the world pass through. All the souls, when a Jew passes from the world, his soul passes, comes from here to Heaven. This is the base, this is the roots. That's why the Arabs don't want us here. Even inside the tomb, Jews are limited in where they can pray. The bigger and more beautiful part is where the Muslims worship. Jews are granted access to this area, which they call Isaac's Hall, for only 10 days of the year. But you just opened the door? Just for one minute? I can’t So why did you open the door? You stay here. Make sure no one enters He’s not letting us in. We tried bribing him. Didn’t help Do you want a hand? Tomorrow is one of the days Jews are allowed into Isaac's Hall. To get it ready, security teams clear the building. Just finishing the page It doesn’t stop there. It ends on the next page I'm also a Jew Please leave No problem. Finish your prayer You said one page, sir This is it No no, enough Please leave You said one page. Now I'm late Happy holidays Even this limited access to Isaac's Hall is cause for ecstatic celebration. We have to expel the enemy out of here. We cannot live with an enemy, because one day they'll kill us. They want to kill us, they believe this is theirs, their religion, and I understand people that are religious, and believe that all of the land of Israel is theirs. And if Muslims believe that Jerusalem, Hebron, Tel Aviv and Haifa and Beersheba, all is theirs - and ask each one of them, he'll tell you, it's theirs - by their religion, we're not supposed to be here. So it's a question of us or them, and I prefer it to be us. This is the only road to Jewish Hebron Sadly, a route saturated with attacks' Every metre Every junction is stained with bleed A new post was built here Two soldiers were in it A terrorist shot from the building opposite Caught them by surprise A serious attack Dead male and female soldiers Others were injured Here a terrorist stabbed.. Genadi Kaufman to death He worked in the Tomb of the Patriarchs Another soldier was slaughtered here A huge terrorist came from the market and slashed his throat The soldier shot him He was a y injure . The cheeky terrorist begged us to treat him I'm won't lie. I didn’t treat him Jews were feeling crowded in the ghetto They started expanding onwards Every year, hundreds of thousands of Jews make the pilgrimage to Hebron's enclave. Dozens of tours are on offer. The visitors can learn about Jewish Heritage before worshiping at the tomb, or they can meet the residents, and see firsthand how they're building the Jewish presence here. Shalom to all of you This is an important location, to understand Hebron, and the propaganda war we are fighting When various groups come to visit, they're given this brochure It's called ‘Ghost Town’ There's nething, it’s all closed The residents have nothing to eat All because of the evil settlers, causing poverty and unemployment Look at the new car park For thousands of cars See the mall with the silver dome? The streets overflowing... with commerce and economic life Here is the real map of Hebron Where's the Jewish settlement. Can anyone pinpoint it? This little blue strip What's the diference between the maps? Where's the Jewish settlement? It's simply enlarged Exactly They enlarge that tiny little strip and produce a whole new picture, which they call Ghost Town After a lot of terrorist attacks because Arabs went on this street, the army decided to close the street, even though I'm for opening the street. I support opening this street because this is one street, and half of it is closed to Arabs, and there's about 2000 streets which are closed to Jews, so I'm for opening all the city of Hebron to everybody. And won't that cause security problems? Well, why should it cause? Arabs are nice human beings that would never do anything to anyone. When someone wants to kill you, kill them first. When someone throws a rock at you, throw the rock back at him. We don't give the second cheek, we're not from that religion. Come here, leave that Good morning. Everyone here? I’m enjoying every moment of this The pressure and adrenalin Stop your life of crime. It's enough now How are you? You got the whole of Hebron here? No, just the criminals And he said to the police: 'we will press charges'. And I replied: 'go ahead.' This terrorist tried to run over people with a car. Anat's been involved in a confrontation outside a local mosque. It's not the first time she's appeared in court. Tell them you're happy to meet here I've known her for, I think, 12 years, and I represented her in 15 cases, and in the majority of them she was acquitted. Anat, come over here e did that in the last tria Confess assault Only five years in prison Time off from your husband We get some peace Jokes like that aren’t funny They get ideas Here. In this plase When you're on the ®ther side, you learn what's important What we're figMing for The black stains we collect here... will one day be understood All this will dissappear And become a shining beacon Anat Cohen has a fearsome reputation in Hebron. "Excuse me, can you please stop her from attacking us?" On the internet, numerous videos show her taking on activists how campaign against the settlers. "Hey! Don't push me!" It's not fair to see only the camera that is pointed at us You need to see the camera that films 360 degrees "A young child that is just hit in the face by the settler" If someone hurts you and you push him away, that’s not violence It's the instinct of a normal person Anywhere in the world. Nothing to do with Jews "Don't push me!" With all the violence around us, we're the gentlest people in the world We're the most patient people in the world The most loving in the world How could you live among people that want to continue what Hitler didn't finish? Israel, this small, small, small country that we have here, because we have only a part of Israel, is surrounded by hundreds of millions of Muslims who think the same, a lot of them want to kill us also, don't want us here, they feel that this is land that's owned by the Muslims, every place that the Muslims ever conquered belongs to Islam. Tel Aviv is theirs, like Hebron is theirs, like Europe is theirs. They conquered Europe once, Europe is theirs. They'll go back, they want it back. So we understand that if we won't fight in this place, if we don't have a right to live in this place, where Jewish history started, where we got the promise of the land of Israel, we own this land, if we don't have a right to live here, we don't have a right to live anywhere. The challenge for Hebron parents is how to create a sense of normality in a very abnormal world. I asked the army to remove all the security walls We want the children to play here Like any other normal place Slides, swings We'll show the Arbs and the world at large... that we're a part of this place We belong here It's our land When we seem intimidated, then they creep up and attack us This is all new I think that's good enough Don’t want to hide it Granny, what's that? It's a memorial garden to honour Gadi and Dina Levy A terrorist came with a suicide bomb This is one of the houses. That’s the other one In the middle is an Arab’s house Is that really an. Arab’s house? Yes, the yellow-door? Arabs live there You know why we're here? We bought these homes For a long time we weren’t allowed in Finally they've allowed us Acquiring a property owned by Palestinians, or proving it actually belongs to Jews, is a murky business. Most cases drag on for years before government permission is granted. On the outskirts of Hebron, an existing settlement has expanded. So far the government has given permission only for a few caravans on a nearby hilltop. Supposedly, they're there to provide storage for municipal equipment, but everyone knows it won't be long before several families take up residence. Can we name this hill after my father? Well, at the moment... Come, let's make a toast Proper coffee to relax you To the State of Israel If someone wants a new settlement they come here Understand? If your family wants to live with the settlers, come to me Thank God we built a new neighbourhood in Kiryat Arba Just a normal neighbourhood like in Tel Aviv It might be difficult for them at first, but they’ll get used to it They'll get used to seeing Jews. With God’s help, a lot of them They’re OK, they’re kosher We're going to do a security evaluation Before dark Today's a special day It coincides with my brother’s memorial day Wie messages of our’hatural growth, the expansion of the Jewish people in the Holy Land... this is our country. No question The most natural thing for a Jew... is to live where Jews lives! 4000 years ago That's why we call this place ‘The Messenger’ We're not hiding. We're doing it in bro'ad daylight -If ,we were hiding it would be 2am Although we eed the army's protection, it will pass Slowly and steadily, they'll realise this Another stronghold, another house... it's inevitable for Jews to be here And I told my soldiers to stand there until the kids come and throw stones at them. And then we'll be waiting down an alley and they have to chase the kids towards our direction and then we'll jump out of the alley and catch the kids. Breaking the silence, is a group of former Israeli soldiers opposed to the occupation. They too offer tours of Jewish Hebron. While we take responsibility for the things that we did. We demand the whole system to take responsibility to where we were sent and the orders that we were forced to follow. And we're not talking about the behaviour of a specific soldier at a specific checkpoint, we're talking about the whole checkpoint. Again, right before we get down, I'm gonna ask you to not... give the settlers any attention. They'll probably come by, try to harass us, stop the tour. Just ignore them. First thing, it infuriates them, second thing, they'll just leave if they don't get any attention. I'm pretty used to them yelling and trying to harass and stop the tour. I could keep talking and you guys can keep listening I promise. Even the settlers themselves don't necessarily see what's happening on the other side of the fences. I know I didn't as an Israeli. It took me a long time to understand what was going on here. Even as a soldier it took me a long time to understand what was really going on and not just looking at it from a very narrow perspective as a soldier. You might ask, a number of people have already asked me, how do the soldiers know who's a Palestinian or not. Well for most of the times, they just ask for an ID. There was a time, where I was guiding a tour here. One of the soldiers called me over in Arabic, he thought I was Palestinian, I was walking down the street. I answered him back in Arabic, he told me to walk over to him, he was very angry that I was walking on a street which I wasn't supposed to walk on. OK and then I switched over to Hebrew and he immediately apologized and said he was sorry and he didn't mean to yell. They asked if you've beaten any Anabs? 'Yes. Have you have beatem amy Arabs? How do the soldiers feel about what you're doing? Do they know? When I was a soldier here I had absolutely no problem with the fact that there were people touring around. Other soldiers did have a problem because they came from right wing homes. He tell me he come from Germany. And you? I come from several places. Why are you afraid all the time? You need to break the silence, no? Look, this man, he is my friend, he's breaking the silence. I'm here to learn. Learn from you, learn from him. If you want to learn from me. Want to come to learn from me? How did you come here? I live here, this is my house. How did you get here? My family were born here. OK, guys, while we walk down the street and throughout our whole tour you'll see a lot of very racist graffiti drawn by the settlers. A lot of it has to say 'death to Arabs'. There's even one in a neighbourhood up there that we won't be walking in to, that says 'Arabs to the gas chamber' okay. Oh yeah, that guy, he does that all the time. Just ignore him he'll go away. You're not going to say you have beaten up Arabs? So right now, we're still walking down this part over here. Are you willing for soldiers to die for the Hebron settlement? I want soldiers to live Are you willing for them to die? I'm willing to die for the Holy Land Why do they need to die? Because soldiers die here So what? We live in the Middle East Are you willing figrtiheri to die? Don't tell me about bereavement I'm from a bereaved family You're willing for soldiers to die? That's what you're saying Who comes to visit victims' families? Who meets parents of murdered babies? Me or you? OK guys, so what's happening right now is the military is stopping us until he has You run away That’s what your organisation does approval from his commander to allow specifically our tours to pass. What's been happening recently is that Breaking the Silence tours have been delayed. All other tours can keep going. Nearby, there's another tour with a very different narrative. It passes through the Kasbah and the former Jewish quarter, now inhabited by Palestinians. The military aren't taking any risks. The.route we’re taking is fully secured We have security on the rooftops Armed forces will accompany us We don't interfere with local life You'll see the market as it really is You’re welcome to speak with them and buy goods Heated encounters are our weak spot We’ve had trouble in the past There'll be no verbal or physical fights We grab both the Palestinian and the precious Jew Can you read' what it says here? Yehoshua Saloma Murdered here of 13 January 1980 The first Jew killed here since 1929 Because of this holy sacrifice, the government allowed us to live in Hebron The terrorists thought this would chase us away But it did’thi'e exact opposite Look at the craftsmanship Beautiful. How lovely Ever come here without the army? I’m not allowed Why? The army doesn't allow Jews Since the peace ‘broke out’ Jews are forbidden entry It’s a closed military area Why are the Arabs upset with you? Not at me. Mad at others Why are they angry? Why are there terrorists? We don’t know why? In God's name we’ll have peace one day He’ll invite me over and I’ll invite him over Are Jews allowed to go aroumd here? No. No. No I showed you on the map Jews aren't allowed in the whole city The trouble is, you pick on them. I pick on them? You pick on them. Then you ‘get it’ over there Why do you think I pick on them? Because... We aren't interested in your opinion This gentleman suggests I’m picking on Arabs Did you see me? You are bothering them. Look at this building Where you kicked the Arabs out You closed their houses, shops. There’s no one there This man has been reading a lot of sci-fi It’s not sci-fi We grab both the Palestinian and the precious Jew No, I want to hear this. What's the matter? We have a few pieces of evidence This house was built by a Jew called! Yehuda Lev Slenim No, he’s fine. He’s net bothering me. It’s all good I asked you to come over so we can talk I’m not your soldier He makes the tour more interesting Throwing debris into their market. You can see where houses, where still Palestinians are living in, are covered in cages right? That's not the army that put it there, it's the Palestinians themselves, protecting their houses from settlers that throw stones at them. What? Sorry? The other buses that went by, they're just normal tours? They're just other tours, sometimes it's settlers, sometimes other groups, erm, yeah. Anything else? The Israeli flag I don't understand, like when you decide to go to a house and arrest somebody arbitrarily. How do you decide where to go in? As a soldier you don't need a warrant to enter a Palestinians house, you just decide that you're going to enter it. Brother, will he let us through? Because someone needs to protect us from settler violence, and because they wanna make sure that it's as quiet as possible, they send soldiers with us. OK? Teach them how to pulverise Palestinian kids This is a Palestinian home, there are still Palestinians using this stairwell and they have to exit when everyday they see death to Arabs here, OK. You cheeky-bastard We tried to save Jews who were murdered by Arabs Shame on you Let's try and stand in the shade. OK so we're standing right over here, OK. Right next to... on one of the red roads OK. This is, we're on the sterilized part of the streets now, OK. Where it's completely segregated and Palestinians can't walk here at all. In 2001 there was a horrible murder here of a baby in the settlement, in Avraham Avinu right behind us. A Palestinian sniper put his scope on a baby's cradle, fired and murdered her. OK. her name was Shalhevet Pass. Immediately after a Palestinian sniper murdered that baby, the settlers went on what the army calls, in their army documents, a week of rage. A Jewish baby girl came here with her parents I was the last to see her alive I was chatting with her parents. I walked away She was shot by a sniper firing from this hill Her name was Shalhevet Pass I took her father to A&E in Kiryat Arba All the way he’s asking about his baby I returned for her But she was already dead When you have a baby girl at home, It’s human nature to try to forget, but I couldn’t I had a big crisis I couldn’t pick up my baby girl I held Shalhevet and her blood was dripping on me It kept taking me back They diagnosed me as post-trauraatic I don't think about it. I try to help If I stop and thiink I'll sink into it And that would be the worst thing Do you hate them? The Arabs? As a people? The Palestinians Of course I hate them Neighbours who are forever scheming to murder me? Of course I hate them. They never let up They remind me daily Today is Passover. We can't have bread You can look at it because it’s not Jewish bread This used to be a kosher place This is what used to be here until the PLO got in now everything is different and now Jews are not allowed to visit here. Only once a week, on this day because of the holiday we are allowed to visit here but we used to visit here many many years to buy bread, to buy things year round we hope to return and to buy things from you alhamdulillah, inshallah. Sorry, did you say that the problem is the PLO. Of course. OK so you say that Jews lived here since 4,000 years ago so that's why you have the right to come back to Hebron. That's your opinion, right? I didn't say anything about rights. I said that we used to come here and to buy things and to have relationship with the people here. You said that you have the right to live here as a Jew. Of course. You say that, I don't say that. I agree, OK. You agree, so it's your opinion. So does it give me the right as a Muslim to go back to Grenada and Sevilla to go back to Grenada and Sevilla and kill people and take their land and and kill people and take their land and say I have the right to live here. No I didn't say, why you speak about killing? You think about killing. I speak about peace, I don't speak about killing. Why your mind is minded to killing of people, I don't understand it. Do I have the right? To go to Grenada and to live there and to buy a house. Yes, yes for sure. You have the right. If you go to Spain, you can live in Spain, we can live in Spain. Only here we are not allowed even to visit. I say we want to come, to meet the friends and to buy things here, this is what I say. Thank you. This is what they think. Jews are not allowed to be here. Jews can go to whatever but not here in Hebron. They come here to support the terror, to support this racism and to support the ethnic cleansing of Jews. Bye bye. We’re on our way to 'The Messenger' Where we put the cabins To make sure everything's fine Maybe the soldiers are still guarding it If not, we’ll guard it Until the next stage Now we only have equipment there And the cabins on their own are problematic Call Centre 91 Go ahead, 91 I'm at 'The Messenger' No Border Police or soldiers Received The attacks are usually... on Friday night They know we're at home on the Sabbath That’s when they attack Oh, Eliave, we're going home now We come inside to the house. This is the father, he sees his daughter with all the blood. I’m scared I’ll break apart. I’ve seen too much I’ve been working in it for 26 years Living it my whole life, since childhood I remember a child who was murdered Eli A’Zeev. Murdered at Beit Hadassh The list goes on. I remember them all We grew up with this in our blood How long can I do it? As much as God will allow With God’s help these attacks will stop We want peace We want to raise our children in peace No terror attacks. No wars My kid is about to be drafted He might go in Gaza. Or Nablus. Or Hebron Or Lebanon to fight. It's crazy No normal person goes looking for war Kids are on Hanukka Road Very good. Keep an eye out Both roads are good Affirmative. Your son is leading us If that’s the case I’m calm Hello, you alright? All good I don't use the word Palestinian It's irrelevant. It's partly caused the conflict The Romans created the word To disconnect the Jews from this land We returned here to build Israel. Not Palestine People are going to live here Who's going to live here? Jews That’s how we expand our country It’s our country, our land, it’s all ours To show the Arabs this land is ours What about daddy's job? It's cool Do you worry a little? I worry a lot About what? That something bad would happen to him 'The Messenger' Calling for redemption A message that we're unifying the whole of Israel 'How wonderful to see a messenger... 'coming across the mountains, bringing good news' Standing here you really feel that ‘How wonderful to see... 'coming across the mountains, bringing good news' 'Announcing victory, saying to Zion, "Your God is king!" Exactly what we're doing here Bringing good news to the nation We're pushing forward Expanding and settling We belong here People of the Torah in the land of the Torah It's the eve of Purim, an important Jewish Holiday. Noam arrives at the cave of Machpelah to lead prayers. Purim celebrates the defeat of the evil Haman, 2,500 years ago. Haman was an adviser to the king of Persia, whom the Jews outwitted after a drunken feast. 'And he wanted to kill not only Mordecai' 'He asked to exterminate all the Jews in the kingdom' Every mention of Haman is greeted with a rowdy outburst. 'And all of the king’s servants by tho king’s gate...' 'bow before Hanan Purim is the story of how the Jews saved themselves Purim is the story of how the Jews saved themselves from genocide by using their own ingenuity. from genocide by using their own ingenuity. This is against the flags up there It has a special resonance with the settlers in Hebron. You guard us. You sacrifice your souls for us Heavy drinking is an essential part of a festival. At the festival of Purim everyone who asks will receive Can I have a house? Everyone who asks will receive The battle of narratives may rage for years to come. But one thing is certain, here where Judaism began, it's hard to imagine the Jews of Hebron will ever leave.
