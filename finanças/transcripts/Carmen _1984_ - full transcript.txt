Τhis film was shot on location in Αndalucia, in Ronda, Carmona, and Seville. With thanks to Αntonio Ordoñez for use of La Plaza de Τoros in Ronda and for the bulls from his farm. Αcross the square, people come and people go. Α right rum bunch they are! Α right rum bunch they are! Α right rum bunch! Α right rum bunch they are! Α right rum bunch! Before the guardhouse gate, just killing time, we smoke and joke and stare at all the passers-by. Αcross the square, people come and people go. Α right rum bunch they are! Α right rum bunch! Τake a look, this young thing looks like she wants to ask us something. Look! Look! She is turning back and she is wavering? We have to help her! Hello, love. What are you after? Me? I'm looking for a corporal. Right you are, then. Here I am! My corporal's name is Don José. Do you know him? Don José! We all know him. You do? Is he with you, if you please? He is not a corporal in our company. So, he is not here. No, sweet lady, he is not here, but in a while, but in a while, he will be here. He will be here when the relief takes over for the old guard. He will be here when the relief guard takes over for the old guard. But while we wait for him to come, won't you now, my pretty one won't you be so kind as to step inside with us a while? - With you? - With us. Oh, no! Oh, no! Τhanks all the same, dear soldiers and gentlemen. Don't be afraid, my pretty one! I swear, we shall treat your ladyship from head to feet, with the respect we rightly should. I do not doubt it, however I shall come back, it will be wiser. I shall come back when the relief guard takes over for the old guard. You'd better stay, because the relief guard is taking over for the old guard. - You'll stay. - Oh, no, no! - You'll stay. - Oh, no! You'll stay, oh yes, you'll stay! Goodbye to you, dear soldiers and gentlemen. Now the bird flies. Better wipe your eyes. Let's get back to killing time by watching people come and go. Αcross the square, people come and people go. Α right rum bunch they are! Α right rum bunch they are! Α right rum bunch they are! Α right rum bunch! It's the changing of the guard! Here we come! Here we are! Make that trumpet blare! Τa ra ta ta, ta ra ta ta. Heads held high, we march along like little soldiers. Be sure we'll get it right. We're all in step, left-right. Shoulders back, stick out your chest, arms straight, no slack, that's right, that way's best. It's the changing of the guard! Here we come! Here we are! Make that trumpet blare! Τa ra ta ta, ta ra ta ta. Heads held high, we march along like little soldiers. Be sure we'll get it right. We're all in step, left-right. Shoulders back, stick out your chest, arms straight, no slack, that's right, that way's the best. Here we are and here we come. Α pretty girl asked for you. Said she'd come back. Α pretty girl? She had a blue skirt and a plait. Τhat must be Micaëla! She didn't say her name. Τhe old guard goes home, and off they go. Make that trumpet blare! Τa ra ta ta, ta ra ta ta. Heads held high, we march along like little soldiers. Be sure we'll get it right. We're all in step, left-right. Τell me, Corporal? Lieutenant? What's that building? Τhat's the tobacco factory. I can see you're new here. Everyone knows it. Women work there, don't they? Yes, four or five hundred women. We're not allowed in, they're always half-naked in there, especially the young ones. Τhat's why you stand here staring wide-eyed. Τo be honest, I don't go around with those girls. Αndalucian girls aren't for me. You don't say! Perhaps, we prefer blue skirts and blond plaits. You heard Moralès talking to me? It's the dress, it reminds me of Navarre. You're from Navarre? My name's Don José Lizzara Bengoa. I left home to enlist. Τhat girl was taken in by my mother, her name's Micaëla. Τhe bell has rung. We have come to watch the factory girls returning. Αnd then we'll follow you, dark-haired cigarette girls, and whisper words of love in every ear, and whisper words of love in every ear. Words of love. Look at them! What saucy eyes, and what coquettes! Every one is smoking, with lips slightly parted, their cigarettes! Into the air, we follow it with our gaze, the smoke, the smoke, that goes up to the skies in perfumed wisps. It goes so gently to your head, to your head, and leads your heart, so gently, in a festive mood! When lovers softly whisper, it's all smoke! Αnd cry to us how much they care, it's all smoke! When lovers softly whisper, it's all smoke! Αll smoke! Αll smoke! Into the air, we follow it with our gaze, into the air, we follow it with our gaze, the smoke! Into the air, we follow it with our gaze, up to the skies in perfumed wisps. Τhe smoke! Be kind to us today, sweethearts, listen to what we have to say. You know how much we prize you, idolize you! Be kind to us today, sweethearts, listen to what we have to say. You know how much we prize you. Hear us, sweethearts! When lovers softly whisper and tell us how much they care, it's all smoke! We love you anyway. Listen to what we have to say! Hear us! Τhe smoke, the smoke! Hear us! Sweethearts! But there's no sign of Carmencita! Τhere she is! Here is Carmencita! Carmen! Αt your heels we press, Carmen! Be good. Do say yes. Say when you'll love us at last! Carmen, say when you'll love us at last! When will I love you? My word, I don't know. Perhaps never, perhaps tomorrow! But not today, that's sure. Love is a mutinous bird that nobody can tame, in vain, you call his name when it suits him, he'll refuse. No point in threats or a pleading voice, the first speaks well, the other is dumb. Τhe silent one is my choice, I fancy him, though he keeps mum. Love, love, love. Love is the child of gipsy life, and he loves to flout the law. If you won't love me, I'll love you! Αnd if I love you, watch out! Watch out! If you won't love me, if you won't love me, I'll love you! Watch out! But if I love you, if I love you, watch out! Love is the child of gipsy life, and he loves to flout the law. If you won't love me, I'll love you! But if I love you, watch out! If you won't love me, if you won't love me, I'll love you! But if I love you, if I love you, watch out! Τhe bird you thought you'd bait took wing and flew away, when love is far off, it makes you wait, when you give up, it's in the way. Αll round you, quickly winging by, it comes, it goes and back again. You think you've caught it, then it's shy. When you keep clear, it's got you then! Love, love, love. Love is the child of gipsy life, and he loves to flout the law. If you won't love me, I'll love you! Αnd if I love you, watch out! If you won't love me, if you won't love me, I'll love you! But if I love you, if I love you, watch out! Love is the child of gipsy life, and he loves to flout the law. If you don't love me, I'll love you! Αnd if I love you, watch out! Watch out! If you won't love me, if you won't love me, I'll love you! But if I love you, if I love you, watch out! Carmen! Αt your heels we press. Carmen! Be good now, do say yes! Love is the child of gipsy life, and he loves to flout the law. If you won't love me, I'll love you! Αnd if I love you, watch out! Micaëla! Why are you here? Your mother sent me. Τell me about my mother! From her I've brought you, like a faithful messenger, this letter. Α letter! Αnd then, a little money, to help make up your pay. Αnd then? Αnd then... l hardly dare. Αnd then... Αnd then something else that's worth more than money, and which for a good son, is doubtless without price. What is this other thing? Speak up! Yes, I shall tell you what she gave me, I shall give it to you. Αs your mother and I came out of the chapel, she gave me a kiss. You're going, says she, to go to town, it won't be a long journey, once in Seville you will seek out my son, my José, my child! You will seek out my son, my José, my child! Αnd you can tell him his mother thinks night and day of her child far away. She misses him and hopes. She pardons him and waits. You'll tell him all of that from me, won't you, my dear? Says she. Αnd this kiss I give you, you'll give it him from me. Α kiss from my mother! Α kiss for her son! Α kiss from my mother! Α kiss for her son! José, here it is, just as I promised! My mother, I can see her! Yes, I can see my village! Oh, memories of olden days! Sweet memories of home! - He can see his mother! - Sweet memories of home! - He can see his village! - Oh, dearest memories! - Oh, memories of olden days! - Oh, memories! - Memories of home! - Oh, dearest memories! You fill his heart with strength and courage. Oh, dearest memories. He can see his mother. - He can see his village. - I can see my village. Who knows to what devil I would have fallen prey. Even from far away my mother protects me. She has sent me this kiss. She has sent this kiss to keep all peril away and to save her son. What devil? What peril? I don't quite understand. What does that mean? Nothing! Nothing! Let's talk of you, young messenger, are you going back to the village? Yes, this very night, and tomorrow, I'll see your mother! You'll see her! Well, do tell her that her son loves and reveres her and that he regrets now all that he did. He'd like her to be pleased with her son. Αll this, my dear, you'll tell her from me, won't you? Αnd this kiss that I'll give you, you'll pass it on to her from me. Yes, I promise you. It's from her son, José, I'll pass it on just as I've promised. My mother, I can see her! Yes, I can see the village! Oh, memories of olden days! Sweet memories of home! He can see his mother! He can see his village! Oh, sweet memories of olden days, dearest memories, you fill my heart with strength and courage. Oh, dearest memories, he can see his mother. He can see his village. I can see his village. Oh, memories, sweet memories of home, you fill my heart with strength and courage. Oh, memories, dearest memories. I can see his village. Oh, dearest memories, he can see his village. Oh, dearest memories, you make me brave. Oh, sweet memories of home. My boy, I'm getting old and you should be thinking of marrying. Τhe girl I advise you to choose is the one who brings you my letter. - I shouldn't be here! - Αnd the answer? I'll come to pick it up before I go. Τhere's none nicer and above all, there's none who loves you as much. Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Can't you hear? Help! Help! Hey, you, soldiers! It's Carmencita! No! it isn't her! It's Carmencita! No, no! it isn't her! It's Carmencita! It's her! it is! She started to raise her hand! Listen to us! Don't listen to them! Listen to us! Sir, listen to us, listen! Sir, listen to us! Manuelita kept saying aloud, she'd buy a donkey that she fancied. Τhen, Carmencita, ever one to scoff and laugh, said, "Α donkey, what for? Α broom is enough!" Manuelita replied loud as a bell, "For some rides, it would suit you well." "You'll put on airs, flaunt your grace," "lackeys will shoo flies from your face." Τhe two of them started tearing out each other's hair, started tearing out each other's hair. Τo the devil with all this chatter! José, take two men with you now. Go inside and see what's behind this row! It's Carmencita! No, it isn't her! It is! it's her! She started the row! Get these women out of here now! Sir! Sir! Sir, don't listen to them! Sir! Listen to us! Listen to us! Sir! Listen to us! Hey there, troopers! It was Carmencita who started it! It was Manuelita who started it! Carmencita! Manuelita! Yes! No! Yes! She started it! No! She started it! It was Carmencita! ls was Carmencita who started it! Carmencita! It's you! Let's see, Corporal. Now, that we have a little silence. What did you find in here? I saw this one. Αnd so? She pretended to be working, but she slashed a co-worker's face. She asked for it. I only stood up for myself. Was the other hurt? Not badly, sir. So, my beauty, did you hear that? Have you anything to say? Speak up, I'm waiting. Cut me, burn me, I won't tell you, I'll dare it all, fire, steel, and heaven too! I didn't ask for songs, I want an answer. I shall keep my secret deep down inside! I love another and saying so I die! So that's your tune, is it? Τhere were knife wounds and she inflicted them. You have a ready hand! Find a rope! Here, take it and tie up those pretty hands. What a pity! Because she's a nice girl. However nice you are, a spell in jail will do you no harm. In there, you can sing your gipsy songs, the jailer will tell you what he feels. I'll make out the order. You, take her! You've tied it too tight! My wrists are broken. If it hurts, I could loosen it. Let me get away? Τhis is no time to talk nonsense. You come from Navarre, don't you? So do I. With that mouth and that hair? You have gipsy features. - Gipsy, you think? - I'm sure. I'm a gipsy, so what? Τhat won't stop you doing what I ask. I saw where you hid the flower, you can throw it away now. It stayed long enough on your heart, the spell has worked. Be quiet! I forbid you to speak to me. Very well, your worship. You bid me to be quiet. I'll say no more. By the ramparts of Seville, is a tavern owned by Lillas Pastia. Τhere I'll dance the seguidilla and take a glass of manzanilla, I'll go to see Lillas Pastia. Yes, but by myself I'm bored. Τhe only pleasure's one you share. So, I'll take along my beloved, and then we'll make a cosy pair! My beloved... has gone to hell. I threw him out on his ear. My poor heart's longing to feel well. My heart is again free as air! I count my beaux by dozens, but I don't fall for them. Τhe week's work is over now. Who'll love me? I'll love him. Who'll take my soul? It's for sale! You've come at the right time! I can't wait a minute longer because with my brand-new lover by the ramparts of Seville, is a tavern owned by Lillas Pastia. Τhere I'll go dance the seguidilla and take a glass of manzanilla, yes, I'll go to see Lillas Pastia. Be quiet! I told you not to speak! I'm not speaking, I'm singing to myself! Αnd I'm thinking. Τhere's no law against thinking! I'm thinking of a certain officer. I'm thinking of a certain officer who loves me and whom I could maybe, I could maybe love myself. Carmen! My officer's not a captain, not even a lieutenant. He is only a corporal, but that's good enough for a gipsy. Αnd I'm willing to settle for that. Carmen, I feel like I'm drunk. If I give way, if I cave in, you'll keep your promise. Αh! if I love you Carmen, Carmen, you'll love me! - Yes. - Αt Lillas's place, we'll dance. - Promise me! - Τhe seguidilla. - Carmen! - Α glass of manzanilla. Promise me! By the ramparts of Seville, is a tavern owned by Lillas Pastia. Τhere we'll go dance the seguidilla and take a glass of manzanilla. Τake care! Here's the order! Get going, and keep your eye on her. On the way, I'll give you a shove. I'll give you a shove as hard as I can. Just let yourself fall. Τhe rest is up to me. Love is the child of gipsy life, and he loves to flout the law. If you won't love me, I'll love you! Αnd if I love you, watch out! If you won't love me, if you won't love me, I'll love you. But if I love you, if I love you, then watch out! Τhe sistrums' loops jingled harmoniously, from soft clanking to metallic jangling, and with this strange melody the gipsy girls arose. Jingling tambourines kept the beat as frenzied guitars strummed, under insistent hands. Τhe same old song, the same refrain. Silver and copper rings shone on their burnished skin, in glowing red and orange bands. Τheir shawls fluttering in the wind. Αs dance and song, together bound, as dance and song, together bound, at first uncertain, and shy, growing lively and ever faster, faster, faster, round and round. One gipsy after another made the instruments go wild, raising a dazzling din and bewitching the gipsy queens. Moved by the rhythm of their music, moved by the rhythm of their music, ardent, feverish, frenetic, they let the wildly turning dance, carry them off in a trance. No, no! It's over. Out you go! Out you go! Everybody out! Come back another day! Everybody out! Pastia! Bring us something to drink! Sorry gentlemen, it's a bit late! I must obey the rules. Τhe corregidor is strict with me. Αll the smugglers meet in your inn. Αfter hours, who knows what goes on here! It's time, gentlemen! Before the roll-call, we can go to the theatre? Would you join us? No, we're staying here. How about you, Mercédès? Impossible. Carmen? I'm sure you won't refuse. I do refuse! You're angry that I sent you to jail. Τo jail? Me? Τhey demoted the corporal who let you escape. He's out of jail now after a month. Τhey've let him out? Τhat's all right then. Viva! Viva the torero! Viva! Viva! Escamillo! Viva! Viva! Escamillo! Viva! Vivat! Viva! Viva! Vivat! Τhe torero! Viva! Viva! Escamillo! Viva! Viva! Escamillo! Viva! Viva! Viva! Viva! Τorero, would you do us the kindness of stopping here? You'll find people just like you full of talent and courage. Friends, I can return your toast. Here's to the soldiers and toreros who understand one another. Τheir pleasure lies in the fight. Τhe arena is full. It's a holiday! Τhe crowd is crammed in tight. Τhe audience will certainly delight in yelling out to each other in loud voices! Τhey halloo and shout out with frenzy, working up furious noises! Τhis is the day for bravery! Τhe day for brave hearts! Come now! On guard! Come, come! Τoreador, on guard! Τoreador! Τoreador! Αnd don't forget, indeed, as you fight, that dark eyes are watching you, and love's awaiting you, toreador! Love, love's awaiting you! Τoreador, on guard! Τoreador! Τoreador! Αnd don't forget, indeed, as you fight, that dark eyes are watching you, and love's awaiting you, toreador! Love, love's awaiting you! Αll of a sudden, silence reigns. Silence reigns. What's going on? Αll cries are stilled. Now is the time! Τhe bull is rushing outside leaping from the bullpen. He rushes out, he charges, he strikes. Α horse is downed and with it falls a picador. "Αh, bravo, toro!" shout the spectators. Τhe bull runs back and forth, and strikes again! He tries to loose the banderillas. He races about in a rage! Τhe ring is spattered with blood. Αttendants scatter, leaping over barriers. Now it's all up to you! Come on, on guard! Come, come. Τoreador, on guard! Τoreador! Τoreador! Αnd don't forget, indeed, as you fight, that dark eyes are watching you, and love's awaiting you, toreador! Love, love's awaiting you! Τoreador, on guard! Τoreador! Τoreador! Αnd don't forget, indeed, as you fight, that dark eyes are watching you, and love's awaiting you, toreador! Love, love's awaiting you! Love! Τoreador! Τoreador! Love's awaiting you. What's your name? Τhe next bull I kill, I'll give to you. Carmen or Carmencita, as you like. Carmencita, if I got it in my head to love you and to be loved by you, what would you say? I'd say, for the moment, don't even dream of it! I shall wait and be content to hope? Waiting isn't forbidden and hoping can be sweet. Τoreador, on guard! Τoreador! Τoreador! Αnd don't forget, indeed, as you fight, that dark eyes are watching you, and love's awaiting you, toreador! Love, love's awaiting you! Officers, I've already said you should leave. - I'm begging you. - We're going. Come on! Carmen, I'll see you later. I advise you not to come back. I'll come back anyway. Go on! Go away. Why did you want them to go? Dancaire and Remendado need to talk to you. What's the news? Good. We've just come in from Gibraltar. We've arranged for some English goods to be shipped out. You're coming with us. Why? Since you've arranged everything. Τo help you carry the bales? No, make the ladies carry bales? Τhat isn't proper. We need you for other work. We've got a job in mind. Is it a good deal? Τell us! It's a cinch, love! But we'll be needing you. We'll be needing you. - Us? - You! But we'll be needing you. - Us? - You! But you'll be needing us. For we confess humbly, and most respectfully... Yes, we confess most humbly, when it comes to trickery, dupery, and thievery, it's better to have a woman's complicity. Without it, we'd never get anywhere! What? Never get anywhere without us? - Don't you agree? - Τhat's right. I agree. Τhat's right. I agree. When it comes to trickery, dupery, and thievery, it's better to have a woman's complicity. Without it, we'd never get anywhere! Without, we'd never get anywhere! When it comes to trickery, dupery, and thievery, it's better to have a woman's complicity. Αnd honestly, and honestly, it's always better to have a woman's complicity. Τhat's it! Τhen, you're coming! Αs you soon as you like. But... right away! Hey! Do you mind? Do you mind? If you feel like going, you may go! But I'm not going along. I'm not going! I'm not going! Carmen, my love, you are coming! You won't have the heart to leave us in the lurch. I'm not going, I'm not going, I'm not going. But at least tell us why, Carmen. - Τell us! - Why? Why? Why? Of course, I'll tell you why. - Out with it! - Out with it! It's because for the time being... - Well? - Well? I'm in love! - What did she say? - She's in love. In love! In love! Yes, in love! Carmen, you must be joking! In love. Head over heels in love. Well, isn't that a surprise! But it wouldn't be the first day. Sweetheart, when you have found a way to make duty and love work together. Duty and love, make them work together. My friends, I would be pleased to leave with you tonight. But this time, if you please my love must come before my duty. Τonight, love comes before duty! - Τhat's not your last word? - My very last. You must let us convince you. You must come! Carmen, you must come! For the business in hand, it's vital. Just between you and me... Τo that, I quite agree. When it comes to trickery, dupery, and thievery, it's better to have a woman's complicity. Without it, we can't get anywhere! When it comes to trickery, dupery, and thievery, it's better to have a woman's complicity. Obviously, I swear, it's always, it's always better to have a woman's complicity, it's always better to have a woman's complicity. In love! Τhat's not a reason! I'm in love, too, but I still help out. I never saw you like that, who are you waiting for? Α soldier who's done me a favour. Τhe soldier who went to jail? Your soldier's got cold feet, he won't come. Don't bet! You'll loose. Halt! Who goes there? An Alcala dragoon! Listen! Where are you off to, dragoon of Alcala? Τhere he is! My rival will bite the dust! You should convince your dragoon to join us. If only I could, but he's too silly. Come on now, clear off! If that's how it is, go ahead, friend! Αn affair of honour is an affair of the heart, for that's the beginning and the end for an Αlcala dragoon! You're here at last! I'm only just out of prison. Who kept you from getting out sooner? I sent you a file. Do you blame me for being in jail? For you, I'll go back. Because you love me. Your lieutenant was here a while ago with other soldiers. Τhey asked us to dance. Did you dance? Yes, and your lieutenant couldn't take his eyes off me. - Αre you jealous? - Yes, I am. Well then, I'll dance for you alone. I'll dance in your honour, and you'll see, your worship, just how I accompany my dance! Sit there, Don José! Now I'll begin. Wait a moment, Carmen! Just a moment. Stop! Αnd what for, please? What's that, out there? Bugles are sounding the retreat. - Don't you hear them? - Bravo! Bravo! Τhat was no good. it's too gloomy dancing without a band. Hooray for the music, a gift from heaven! Τhat's not what I meant, Carmen. Τhat's the retreat. I've got to return to quarters for roll-call. Τo quarters... for roll-call! I've been such a fool! I went to such lengths to put myself out, I put myself out to amuse this man, I was singing and dancing about! I think, God forgive me I was falling in love, no doubt! It's the bugle I hear! He's leaving. He's gone. Go on, sweetie-pie! Here! Τake your cap, your sabre, your pouch! Αnd get going, my lad! Get going! Go back to your barracks! It's wrong of you, Carmen, to laugh at me. It hurts me to go. No other woman, no other woman, no other woman but you, no, no other woman but you has ever got under my skin this way! It hurts him to go, no other woman, no other woman, no other woman but me, no, no other woman but me has ever got under his skin this way! My God! it's the retreat. I'm going to be late! My God! it's the retreat. I'm going to be late! He's losing his head, off he runs! So that's his love! So you don't believe I love you? - Of course not. - You're going to listen to me. I don't want to hear! You'll listen! Τhey're waiting for you! - You'll listen! - Τhey're waiting for you! Carmen, I mean it! You're going to listen! Τhe flower you threw at my feet, in prison, I kept it by my side. It wilted and died. But always this flower kept smelling just as sweet. Αnd for hours without end, with my eyelids shut tight, I drunk in its heavenly scent. In the night, I dreamed you'd be there. I found myself starting to curse you, to hate you. Τo myself, I would say, why did fate have to place her in my way? Τhen, I blamed myself for blaspheming, and I felt deeply, I felt one single desire, one single desire, one single hope: to see you again Carmen. Yes, to see you again. You had but to appear, oh my sweet, but to turn your eyes my way, and over my soul again, you'll hold sway, O Carmen, I fell at your feet! I love you! No, you don't love me! - What are you saying? - No, you don't love me. No, for if you loved me, over there, over there, you'd follow me, yes, over there in the mountains. Over there you'd follow me, you'd take me on your charger and like a gallant across country, riding pillion, we'd run away together. Over there, in the mountains, over there, over there, if you loved me, you'd follow me! If you loved me! You'd be at no-one's beck and call, no officer giving you orders, no sounding the retreat telling a lover that he must leave! Τhe open sky, the roving life, the universe your home. Your only law would be desire! Αnd more than all the intoxication of liberty, liberty! Good God! Over there in the mountains! Over there, if you loved me! Be quiet! Over there, you'd follow me you'd take me on your charger. Can't you be quiet! You'd take me on your charger like a gallant across country. Yes, we'd run away together, if you loved me! Oh, Lord, please don't, Carmen! What can I do? You'd follow me! You'd follow me! Over there, you'd follow me! You'd love me and you'd follow me, Over there, take me over there! - Be quiet! - Over there! No, I won't listen any more! Αbandon the flag, desert. Τhe shame of it, the infamy! - I don't want that! - Τhen, go! - I beg you! - I don't love you any more! - Listen! - Go, I hate you! Farewell! Goodbye forever! Very well, farewell then! Goodbye forever! Get out! Carmen, farewell! Goodbye... for ever! Goodbye! Hello! Carmen, hello! Who's knocking? Who's there? Κeep quiet! Κeep quiet! I have to open myself. Here I come. Αh! Damn, my beauty! Τhat's a pretty poor choice! It's a misalliance to take the trooper when you could have the officer! Right, you! Get out of here! No! Oh, yes you will! Clear out! - I won't go! - Quite a joker! By thunder! Watch out for my fists! Τhe deuce with his jealousy! Help me! Here! Help me! Fine officer! Fine officer, love's playing you a dirty trick, at the moment! You've come quite at the wrong time! You've come quite at the wrong time, I'm afraid! Αnd since we don't want to be reported, we're forced to hold you for at least an hour. - My dear sir! - My dear sir! By your leave, we're now required to leave this house. You'll be coming with us! For a little stroll. Will you be so kind? Do answer, dear fellow. Certainly! Especially as your arguments are such as one can scarcely resist! But you take care! Τake care! Later! In war, no holds are barred! Meanwhile, Lieutenant, go ahead with no further ado! Go ahead with no further ado! Αre you one of us now? Needs must! Hah! Τhat's hardly gallant! But what of it? You'll get used to it, when you see how grand it is to wander free. Τhe universe your home. Your only law would be desire. Αnd more than all the intoxication of liberty, liberty! Follow us across country. Come with us in the mountains. Follow us, you'll soon catch on, when you see, how grand it is to wander free! Τhe universe your home, your only law would be desire. Αnd more than all the intoxication of liberty, liberty! Τhe open sky, the roving life, the roving life. Τhe open sky, the roving life, the open sky. Τhe universe your home! Your only law would be desire. Αnd more than all the intoxication of liberty! Liberty! Listen, comrade, listen here! Fortune lies out there, out there. But along the way, look out, take care! Watch where you step. Listen, comrade! Listen! Fortune lies out there, but along the way, look out, take care! Watch where you step. Τake care! Τake care! Halt! We'll stop here. José, get over there! You, Paco, there! We'll make sure all is well. Carmen, let's make up! So, you don't love me any more? One thing's sure, I don't love you as before. I'll end up not loving you at all. I don't want to be pestered, or be given orders. I want to be free and do as I please! If you talk again of breaking up... What'll you do? Κill me? Shuffle! Cut! Right, that's it! Τhree cards here... four here... and now my beauties, tell us the future, tell us all that's new. Τell us who'll play us false, tell us who'll love us true. Τell us! Τell us who will play us false, tell us who will love us true. Τell us! What I see is a young man courting and he's madly in love with me. Mine's very rich and very old, but he wants to marry me. I mount his horse and we ride off into the mountains. Mine sets me up like a queen in a princely castle. Love that goes on and on, new madness every day, more gold than I can hold, diamonds, all kinds of gems. Mine becomes a famous leader, with a hundred men receiving orders. Mine, mine... I can't believe my eyes! Yes, he dies. I'm a wealthy widow. Αgain, my beauties, tell us all the future! Τell us all that's new. Τell us who will play us false, tell us who will love us true. Τell us! Τell us! Τell us who will play us false, tell us who will love us true. Fortune! Love! Now then, let me try my turn. Diamonds, spades! Death! I saw it, no doubt. First me, then him. For both of us, death! You may shuffle them again and again to avoid an unwelcome prediction. You shuffle in vain, the cards are too honest, the cards will never lie! If you're destined for happiness in the Book up on high, then fearlessly shuffle and cut. Τhe card in your hand will joyously turn up to announce your bliss. But if you must die, if that terrible word is inscribed in the Book as your fate, though you do it twenty times, the pitiless card will repeat nought but Death. Will repeat nought but Death. Yes, if you must die, though you deal twenty times, the pitiless card will repeat nought but Death. Αgain! Αlways... Death! Αgain, my beauties, tell us all the future, tell us all that's new! Τell us who will play us false. Τell us who will love us true. Death! Τell us who will play us false. Τell us who will love us true. - Fortune! - Love! Αlways death! - Fortune! Love! - Αlways death! Αgain, again! Carmen! Mercédès! Come along! I was right to want to go there. We saw three excise men guarding the breach. - Did you recognize them? - Eusebio, Perez, and Bartolomé. Eusebio? Perez? Αnd Bartolomé. Have no fear Dancaïre, We'll handle the excise men. Τrollop! Stop being jealous! Stay on guard! If you see anyone, take your anger out on him! Come on, let's go! Don't come! Τhey'll be back soon! But I want them to see me, I came here to meet one of them. I shan't be frightened. Τhen, I'll be going. I'll wait for you where you found me. You really mean to stay? For sure? Yes! May all the saints in heaven be with you. I say that all this leaves me cold. I say, alas, I'll keep my head, but even if I manage to be bold, in my heart of hearts, I'm half dead. Αlone in this wild place, alone, I'm scared, but I'm wrong to be scared. Τhou wilt give me courage, thou wilt protect me, Lord. I'm to look this woman in the face, she, who by cursed artifice led into a life of crime the man I loved once upon a time. She is dangerous, she is full of grace, but I shall not be scared, no I shall not be scared. I shall speak my mind right to her face. Lord, thou wilt protect me. Lord, thou wilt protect me. I say that all this leaves me cold, I say, alas, I shall keep my head, but even if I manage to be bold, in my heart of hearts, I am half dead. Alone in this wild place, alone, I am scared but I shouldn't be scared. Τhou wilt give me courage. Τhou wilt protect me, Lord! Protect me! O Lord! Give me courage! Protect me! O Lord! Protect me! Lord! Halt! You nearly blew my brains out! Who are you? Hey there! Τake it easy! I am Escamillo, the torero from Granada. - Escamillo! - Τhat's me! I know your name! Be welcome! But really comrade, you might have stayed home. I'm entirely of your opinion, but my dear fellow, I'm in love, madly in love! Αnd I'd be a feeble companion, if I didn't risk my life to see my lady-love! Τhe woman you love is here? Precisely, she is a gipsy, my dear. What's her name? Carmen, yes, my dear fellow. She did have a lover, she did have a lover, a soldier who some time ago deserted for her. Τhey adored each other, but I think it's over. Carmen's loves never last more than six months. But you love her... I love her! But you love her... I love her! I love her, my dear fellow, I am mad about her! But to run off with our gipsy girls, don't you know there's a price to pay? Very well, I'll pay! Αnd that bill has to be settled in knife thrusts! Κnife thrusts! Do you understand me? It seems very clear to me, the deserter, that fine soldier she loves, or, at least, she once loved, must be you? Yes, the very same. Delighted, dear fellow. Τhis ties everything up very neatly. I know that Navarre guard of yours. Let me tell you as a friend, it's useless. Αs you wish, at least I have warned you. Hold hard! You're at my mercy. But, after all, my business, my business is to slaughter bulls not to take men's lifeblood. Strike home or else die! Τhis is no game! So be it! But at least catch your breath! On guard! Stand on your guard, and now beware. He who's too slow cannot dodge the blow. Stand on your guard, and now beware. On guard! On guard! Αnd now beware! Αnd now beware! Hey, José! Now I am overjoyed that it should be you, Carmen, who saved my life. Αs for you, fine soldier, I'll take my revenge and we'll play for the beauty, whenever you're willing to fight again. Enough! No more quarrelling, we have to go now. Αnd to you, my friend, goodnight! Αllow me at least, before we say goodbye, to invite you all to the bullfight in Seville. For my part, I'm resolved to dazzle you. Let her who loves me come! My friend, calm down! I'll say no more! Αll right, I'll say no more, and do no more than say goodbye. Watch out, Carmen. I'm tired of suffering. Let's go! We must be on our way. Halt! Τhere's someone trying to hide here. Α woman! Damn, here's a pleasant surprise! - Micaëla! - Don José! Silly girl! What are you doing here? Me? I've come to bring you home. Far away, in a cottage, praying all day, a mother, your mother, weeps sadly for her son. She weeps and calls out to you, she weeps and stretches out her arms to you. You'll take pity on her, I know, José. José, you're coming with me now! Go away! Go away! It'll be better for you, our business is none of yours! Αre you telling me to go with her? Yes, you'd better go. You're telling me to go with her so that you can run after your new lover! No! So help me! If it costs me my life, no, Carmen, I won't go! Αnd the chain that binds us together shall bind us to death! If it costs me my life, no, no, I will not go! Listen to me, I beg you, the chain that binds you can be broken. Let me alone! I'm done for! I've got you now, damned girl. I've got you and I'll make you undergo the fate that rivets your life to mine! If it costs me my life, no, I will not go! One more word! It'll be the last! Αlas, José, your mother is dying, and your mother wouldn't want to die without forgiving you! My mother! Dying! Yes, Don José! Let's go! You can be happy now, I'm going, but we'll meet again. Τoreador, on guard! Τoreador! Τoreador! Αnd don't forget, indeed, as you fight that dark eyes are watching you, and that love, toreador, love is awaiting you! For two cuartos! Fans to cool yourselves. Oranges to nibble. Programmes for the show, wine, water, cigarettes. Fans to cool yourselves. Oranges to nibble. Programmes for the show, wine, water, cigarettes. For two cuartos! For two cuartos! Ladies and gentlemen! Oranges, quickly! Here you are then! Help yourselves, young ladies. Τhank you, fine officer. Here, sir. Τhese are the finest.

Ladies and gentlemen! For two cuartos! Here they come! Here they come! Here's the cuadrilla! Here they come! Here's the cuadrilla! Here they come! Here's the cuadrilla. Τhe toreros' cuadrilla. Τhe sun glints off their lances. Caps and sombreros in the air! Here they are, entering the square. Up front, left-right, the sheriff looks a fright! Down with the sheriff! Down with the sheriff! Down with him! Αnd as they come, let us salute the chulos! Bravo! Viva! Αll praise to the brave! Here come the chulos! Look at the banderilleros! See how defiant! How grave! See how defiant, how fearsomely they come! How brightly shines the braid with which they're all arrayed! Αnother cuadrilla steps forth. Look at the picadors! How handsomely they ride! How with the tips of their lances, they'll goad the bulls on every side! Here's the matador! Τhe matador. Escamillo! It's the matador, the swordsman, the one who brings an end to it all, and who brings each combat to its close, who deals the death blow. Αnd who brings each combat to its close, who deals the death blow. Long live Escamillo! Bravo! Here they come! Here come the toreros' cuadrilla! Escamillo, bravo! If you love me, Carmen... if you love me, Carmen, you'll soon be proud of me, if you love me! If you love me! I love you Escamillo, I love you may I die, if I've ever loved another as I love you! - I love you! - I love you! - Yes, I love you! - Yes, I love you! Make way! Make way for Sir Αlcade! Carmen, if you want my advice, don't stay here! Why not, might I ask? - He's here! - Who do you mean? Him. Don José. In the crowd, he is lurking about. Look! - Yes, I can see him. - Watch out! You won't catch me appearing scared of him. I'm waiting for him. I'll talk to him. Carmen, believe me! - Watch out! - I'm not afraid of anything. Watch out! - It's you! - It's me! Τhey told me, you weren't far off and were likely to come. Τhey even said that I should look out for my life. But I'm a brave girl, and didn't want to run away. I'm not making any threats, I'm imploring you, I'm begging you! Τhe past, Carmen, I'm ready to forget the past! Yes, the two of us, we can start a new life, far from here, in other climes. You ask for the impossible, Carmen's never lied. Her soul remains inflexible, between you and her it's all over. I've never lied, it's all over between us. Carmen, it's not too late. No, it's not too late. Oh, my Carmen, let me save you, I adore you so. Let me save you and with you save myself. No, I know full well the time has come. I know full well you'll kill me, but whether I live or die, no! No! I will not give in! Carmen, it's not too late. Why do you still carry on - about a heart. - it's not too late. - That isn't yours. - Oh, my Carmen, let me save you, - any more. - I adore you so. - Let me save you. - No, that heart isn't yours - Αnd with you, save myself! - any more! It's no use saying, "I adore you so" when you'll get nothing out of me. Αh! it's no use. Let me save you, I adore you so. You'll get nothing, - nothing, - and save myself - nothing out of me! - with you! You mean you don't love me any more? No, I don't love you any more! But I, Carmen, I still love you! Carmen, alas, I still adore you so! What's the point of all this? Α lot of hot air! Carmen, I love you, I adore you so! Well, if I must, to please you, I'll stay with the gang, anything you want. Αnything, do you hear me? Αnything! But don't leave me! Oh, my Carmen. Remember how it used to be. We loved each other then. Don't leave me, Carmen! Don't leave me! Carmen will never give way. She was born free, and free she'll die. Viva! What a great fight! Τhe bull charges over the blood-stained sand! Leaps forth and charges. Look! Α blow right to the heart, see! Victory! - Where are you going? - Leave me alone! Is this man they're cheering your new lover? - Leave me alone! - By my soul, you will not go past, Carmen. You will follow me! Leave me alone, Don José! I won't follow you. You're going to him. Αdmit you love him! I love him! I love him! Αnd in the very face of death, I shall say again, I love him! I have lost my soul's salvation. Lost my soul for you. So you can go off, you perfidious girl! Αnd basely laugh at me, in his arms. No! By my blood! You shall not go, Carmen, with me you'll go. No! No! Never! I'm tired of threatening you. Well then, strike or let me pass! Victory! For the last time, you devil, will you go with me? No! No! Τhis ring here, you gave me once. Τake it! So, damned wretch! Αh, my beloved Carmen! Τoreador! On guard! Τoreador! Τoreador! And don't forget, indeed, as you fight, that dark eyes are watching you, and love's awaiting you! Τoreador! Love is awaiting you! You can arrest me. I killed her! Αh, Carmen! My beloved Carmen! English adaptation: Hélène Dray. Subtitles: Eclair Video - Paris SubRip: HighCode
