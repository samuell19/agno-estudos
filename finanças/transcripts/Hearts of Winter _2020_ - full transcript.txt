[upbeat music] â™ª Edited & Synced by TehBotSosro Apapun Makanannya, Minumnya Teh Botol Sosro Ah. You've done a fantastic job on the house, Bethany. Thank you. The Wilsons think it's just beautiful. And meaningful. Beautiful and meaningful. Mm-hmm. And now that we've appreciated the house we should go. You know, I just want to take another look at these throw pillows. Wait, why? They're perfect. Well, don't you think your eye would be more drawn around the room if the striped pillow was placed to the left? No, I think it's perfect and that we should go. [mumbles] Hmm. I don't know. No, no. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. If we don't leave for Denver right now we're gonna hit some serious traffic. Can you believe that I'm gonna be on Hello Today to talk about my book on interior design? Well, we gotta get there first though, let's go, let's go. Alright, alright, alright, alright. Let's go! [applause] I'm Sullivan Davenport and this is Hello Today. I am so excited to welcome today's guest, local interior designer, Bethany Cain. Welcome, Bethany. Thank you so much for having me. Hi, everybody. Bethany has developed a system for home design and organization called M.A.P. The MAP System. Can you tell us a little more about it? Sure. The MAP System uses creative visualization to help people bring meaning, abundance and peace into their homes. It's pretty simple. Just put the name of your kid on the outside of the jar and you would be surprised. It's like magic. All of a sudden... Dad, this is a good idea. What's a good idea? This candy thing with the cute jars. You know, your grandma used to try and hide the candy from me by putting it in a cracker box in the pantry? She thought she was so sneaky. You've been promising we can finally get some stuff to decorate the kitchen. What're you talking about? What's wrong with the kitchen? It's functional. Don't forget I have skating practice after school today. How could I forget? I washed your skating dress last... night. Hey, Zoe? How would you feel about being a flamingo instead of a swan for your exhibition? Dad, not again. A-ha. There is the culprit. Sorry. Can you flip your pancake? Yeah, yeah. Hold on a sec. All right. Perfect. Hey, Dad? Can you tell me the bowl story again? Oh, the bowl story? Ah. Well, your mom used to make pancakes in this bowl every Sunday. With chocolate chips. So many chocolate chips. One day I was washing the bowl and it slipped out of my hands, of course, 'cause I'm a klutz, and it hit the edge of the sink and it chipped. I was gonna throw the bowl away and your mom said "what're you doing? It's just a chip." But now the bowl has a story and it makes the pancakes taste even better. They do taste pretty awesome. Good, 'cause I'm hungry. This is the book. And I believe you had one more announcement? Yes, I do. In conjunction with my book I am very happy to announce my New Year, New Home makeover contest. So I am offering a local Denver family a complete home makeover using my MAP System. And we'll be posting regular video updates so all you guys can follow along too. Okay, so how do we enter this fabulous contest? Just go to my website, BethanyontheMAP dot com. There's a little icon that says "New Year, New Home makeover", click on that, it has all the information. Oh, man, we gotta go. Wait, I wanna see the rest of this. I can't, sweetie. I've got a full day of tours at the lodge, okay? You got all your school stuff packed up? Yep. Okay, I'm gonna warm up the car. Meet me outside. Okay, you heard it here, folks. Go to BethanyontheMAP dot com, enter the contest. Thank you so much, Bethany, for coming on the show and for all of your great ideas. I'm Sullivan Davenport, this is Hello Today. We will be right back after this break. [applause] Bethany, this is big. I know, she shook my hand. No, no, this is bigger than being on Hello Today again. What're you talking about? I just got a call from Beautiful Homes magazine and they wanna feature your book in their next issue. Tell me you're not kidding. I'm so not kidding. And... and they're gonna tie in the contest, too. [laughs] They say it's perfect for their "getting a fresh start "in the New Year issue". They're gonna do a spread on the whole transformation. This is a national magazine. I know. This could be a game changer! There's just... there's just one little hitch. Oh no, what? In order to get into the issue we have to get it done in three weeks. Three weeks? Mmmhmm, yeah. Wait a minute. That would mean we'd have to pick the winner in like two days. Mmmhmm. And then we've got prep, we've got demo. I mean, that leaves absolutely no time for tweaking. Or eating or breathing or sleeping, but we can get it done. [sighs] Okay, okay, we can get this done. Okay. We can do this. - Can we do this? - Yeah. We can do this. - We're gonna get it done. - We're gonna get it done. We're gonna get it done. - We're going to get this done. - We're gonna get this done. All the snow cabins are booked to capacity for the next three months so let's add more shuttles to the ski runs, a few more snowshoeing excursions, some winter hikes, and let's open the fire pits for marshmallow roasting. I'll order some more roasting sticks. Good call. Also, have you had a chance to inventory the snow sleds and tubes? That'll be on the schedule for today. Okay. It's my first year as activities director, you know? I just... I just wanna make sure everything runs like clockwork. Hey. I noticed we've got 35 guests reserved for the Snowflake Tea but we only have seating for 30. All right. Can we squeeze an extra five in? Not unless you wanna open up a window and attach an igloo to the side of the restaurant. Could be cute. Okay, um... let's do a second seating. That way we can accommodate more guests. I forgot to tell you, we have to cut the sleigh rides. The sleigh lost a runner and it's gonna take a month to get a replacement. What? Okay, I just need the final headcount for my staff. Yes, um... can't we get another sleigh? Everything's booked. Let's brainstorm about it later, all right? Thank you. You doing okay? Yeah, yeah. Great. You seem pretty stressed. Yeah just... you know just busy. I got everything going on here and then I'm playing both parents to Zoe. I just feel like there needs to be two of me. Hey, Grant, I've been your best friend since high school. You know I'm here if you need any help. Yeah, I appreciate that. Thank you. I'm trying out some new stuff for the winter tasting menu. Will you and Zoe be my guinea pigs tonight? Uh, a hundred percent. That way I don't have to make mac and cheese again. I told Zoe I'd give her a cooking lesson, anyway. [phone rings] Speaking of. Hey Zoe, everything okay? Did you get the book? Uh, what book? For my book report. If I don't show the teacher tomorrow I'll get points off. Okay sweetie, I'm sorry, but you gotta give me a little bit more warning. I told you about it yesterday. Okay. Don't worry, I'm sure we'll figure everything out. So don't be fooled into thinking you have to pick between practicality and style, because you don't. Your home can and should be a beautiful reflection of you and your family. [applause] Thank you. Unfortunately, Bethany will be leaving us soon but there's still time to get signed copies of "To the Neat of Your Own Drum" on sale here this evening. Why can't we go to the library? Because the library is closed. Besides, I'm sure we can find something here. Oh, oh! Look at that. "Fairy Tale University". Dad, that's a princess book. I thought you liked princesses. When I was eight. Sorry. I want this one. That story sounds like it ends in nightmares for a week. No thanks. Dad. Zoe. I'm sorry. Excuse me. I hate to eavesdrop but I couldn't help but overhear you're looking for a book. I need something for my book report. Dad is picking a bedtime story. Apparently, I have no idea what a 13-year-old reads. [laughs] Well, do you mind if I make a suggestion? Please do. Okay, well when I was your age, which was a very, very long time ago, I used to love this series- I don't know if they have now... oh, they do. Yeah, here it is. So it's called Zelda Zanders. Now, by day she's this 13-year-old straight A student. Ooh, I like that. Okay. By night she's this international spy. Oh yeah. So this is the first book in the series, "Drama Club Double Agent". It is so good. I promise you you're gonna love it. You were on TV this morning. Yeah, you saw that? With the contest. That was me. Contest? What contest? Thanks so much for the book. I'm gonna start reading this right away. Okay. - Okay. - Okay. Uh, thank you. You're so welcome. Happy reading. Hopefully that book works out for you. It probably will. She has good taste. Who? The woman in the book store. Ah. Is it always this cold in January? Yep. I got a surprise for ya. Mmmhmm? Joel is coming over to cook dinner tonight. Oh, that's great. I want to talk to him about something. Oh yeah? What's that? It's for a paper about restaurants. Hmm. [knocking] Oh, speaking of. Hey. Oh, thank you. Oh, okay. What've you got in here? I got a lot of good stuff going on. A little something for- Can you hold this? That's not a fair trade. Hey, Zoe. Is it time for my cooking lesson? Yeah. Tonight we cook turmeric chicken and farro. Good, 'cause we need to talk. Cool. You can start by chopping the onions. Okay, but I need goggles. They always make me cry. Yeah, they make me cry, too. Do you know who Bethany Cain is? What, is she like a singer or something? No. She's this really cool designer and I want her to come makeover our house. I'll talk to your dad, but you know how he is about this place. You can't tell my dad anything. What're you up to, Zoe? Hey. You guys need any help? Uh, no. We uh, we got it covered. Yeah? You guys are cooking soon though, right? We're gonna cook. Did I mention I was starving? Yeah, we know. We got it. Just, you know, a little hint. It's a contest. I'll be at the lodge tomorrow before my skating practice. You can go over it when Dad's not around. All right. Cool. Hey, Joel. I'm starving. Just saying. Let's cook. He's hungry. [knocking] - Hey. - Hey. How's my baby sister? Oh, just freaking out a little bit. I thought you wanted to be rich and famous. Well-respected and universally admired is what I was going for. [laughs] Where are the kids? Oh, I left them at home with Charlotte. Oh, okay. I'm assuming you want cocoa? You got any whipped cream? Uh, no. But I can make you some fresh. I just spray the canned stuff right in my mouth. How are we related? What can I say? You got all the designer genes and I got all the awesome. [laughs] Thanks. Okay, so what do you want to talk to me about? Just wanted to check in on you, with the whole book release thing. Oh, yeah. I didn't want you obsessing over sales stats or order clicks or what colour napkins you're gonna use at your next dinner party. Uh, mulberry. With an antique brass napkin ring. Cute. And then there's this makeover. I just feel like it's so rushed, you know? And if it doesn't turn out well then the magazine doesn't have to use it. There's that. You know it'll turn out perfectly. It always does. But I just don't do my best work under this kind of pressure. Bethany- And when I'm under this kind of pressure I miss final touches and final touches are very important- Stop. You got this. And even if there are hiccups along the way you'll just turn them into designer wall sconces or something. I prefer table lamps to sconces, but... You're hopeless. I love you, but you're hopeless. Excuse me, mademoiselle, do you have a reservation? I'm just waiting for dad to take me to skating practice. Zoe was wondering if she could just hang out with you for a bit? Yeah, pull up a seat. Thanks, Lisa. So did she catch on? No way. I'm super sneaky. What about your dad? He doesn't have a clue. Okay, well we got about 10 minutes if we're lucky. Okay. I made a rough draft. This is pretty good. You read, I'll type. My dad, Grant could really use some help. My mom passed away a few years ago. We had just moved into our new house, so we never got to decorate anything. Now my dad's kinda stuck. I think you're right that when your house looks pretty it makes you feel good. My dad deserves to feel good. He just got a promotion and he's so busy now that he never gets to have any fun. Sometimes he messes things up because he has to be my dad and my mom, but I think he's doing a pretty good job. Anyways, please pick my dad to win the contest. Thanks, Zoe. Hey, Emerson? Yeah? Come here for a second. What's up? Read this. It's from a girl about her dad, and I guess what really struck me about it is that she didn't write in for herself, she wrote in for somebody else. This is beautiful. Yeah. It really is. I mean, look at what she says about him. I don't know, I just- I feel like I could really do something great for that family. Look at the house. It's got great bones. Yeah, it does. It does. You can do a lot with this. This is it. It's perfect. Yeah. Okay. All right, well then uh, just call him tomorrow, let him know, and I think we can get started by Tuesday. Will do. Okay. Thank you. We got it. Yeah. That's all for today, Zoe. But I didn't get it. We have more time before the exhibition. Can I try one more time? Ah, I'm sorry, Zoe. My next student's here. It's already 5:00? Come on. We have to go. Clock's ticking, Dad. What's the hurry? Hi guys. Hey. Oh yeah. - This is gonna be perfect. - Yeah. A home makeover contest? I can't believe you did this without telling me. That's what made it a surprise. I don't need a surprise and I don't need a home makeover. Don't act mad, okay? Be nice. The house is fine just the way it is. [crash] Is it? [knocking] You are about to meet our winners. Very exciting. [laughs] Okay. Oh. Hi. Hey. Uh, bookstore, right? Wait. You guys know each other? Well, we haven't been formally introduced. My name's Bethany. Nice to meet you. And this is Emerson. Hi. Grant, and this little bookworm here is Zoe, my daughter. I totally love Zelda Zanders. Yeah? Does she ever end up defeating Cormac Thunderson? Wait, don't tell me. You couldn't drag it out of me. This is amazing. Well, I guess we were just destined to be friends, huh? [laughs] Uh, yeah. I guess you guys need to see the inside of the house. Yeah, that would be helpful. [laughs] Come on in. Okay, come on, guys. Watch your step, watch your step. Excuse the mess. I wasn't expecting company. At all. Come with me, Bethany, I'll show you my room. Just so you know, I normally would have hidden all my stuff under the bed first, but I figured you wanna see how it really looks. Well, you are correct. See you soon. Okay, uh, who exactly is that and why are they taking so many pictures of my house? It's for the spread in Beautiful Homes magazine. Zoe didn't say anything about a magazine. She didn't? No. Oh, well, don't worry. They won't be here the whole time. Oh, this is going to look great on the website. [sighs] All right, well I have got some really big ideas already, starting with this entryway. I want to get a hall tree for her skates and school supplies, keep it real organized over here. Um, and then a piece of artwork over the mantle. Okay. Oh yeah, and what do you think about putting some wallpaper on that wall? Something patterned, bright. Warm it up in here. Yes. Okay, a little artwork over the mantle is fine but we don't need any wallpaper. [gasps] Ooh, look at this patio. This is nice. This is beautiful. I love this patio. I can do so much with this. Yeah, we don't use that very much. Well, we're gonna change that. This is all part of the transformation. What if I don't want a transformation? Uh... well, uh... why did you enter the contest? I didn't enter the contest. Come on, Dad. Bethany said I can get a new bedspread, vanity, and curtains. What're you talking about? I thought you loved that purple comforter. Okay, well if it's meaningful to you, that's great. It's the "M" part of my MAP system. We can just repurpose it, maybe some throw pillows for your bed? How about that? Yeah. Okay. Wait, you just wanna cut it up? And I think that we're definitely gonna have to get rid of this furniture. Yeah, most definitely. And is this what you're using as an office? Yeah. Yeah, it works great. Okay, well I'm gonna make it work even better for you, okay? I'm gonna give you your own dedicated space in the front room, I'm thinking? Yep. It's gonna be nice and quiet and peaceful. Okay, this-honestly, this is... this is a lot. Look, simple little things like lighting can just warm up a room. You would be surprised. This? It's just a lamp. There's not much difference that's gonna make. It makes a lot of difference. [clears throat] Listen, Grant. I know that this can be really overwhelming, I get it, okay? But I promise you it's all gonna be worth it in the end. You just have to be open to some possibilities, that's all. Oh, um, except for an extra set of keys. We're gonna be in and out, I don't wanna bother you, so- I don't have an extra set of keys. Okay, well, we'll just have some made tomorrow. You know what, I think I have enough to get started for today. Good. So I'll just leave you guys to your family time. Oh, wait. We should um... we should get a picture of the three of you together. Oh, okay. Oh, here. You get in the middle. All right. Actually, Bethany, can you go in the middle? Are you sure? Mm-hmm. Yep. All right. Let's see... a little closer. A little closer to Grant this way. Closer still. Yep. Ah, okay. Ready? One, two, three. Say "cheese". - Cheese. - Cheese. Great. I like Bethany. I'm happy she's helping us. You don't care that she's going through all your stuff? What if she wants to give some of it away? Joel says we have to let things go to grow. Oh, really. Joel's been reading too many self-help books. Don't you think she's pretty? Who, Joel? No, Dad. Bethany. Yeah, I know. Look, it's a little late for 20 questions. You need to go to bed. Wait. We have to say mom's prayer. Yes, we do. Okay, ready? (Together) God bless this home, god bless this girl, god bless the people of this world. Teach us to love the way you do and trust your love will see us through. Amen. Amen. Okay, now you go to sleep. Mwah! Goodnight. Sleep well, okay? See you tomorrow. [groans] Okay. [sighs] There is so much that you can do with that house. It's really beautiful, Bethany. You see it, don't you? Ugh. Can't we just get somebody else? Why would we get someone else? Because this guy doesn't even want a makeover. Yeah, but the Olivers are kind of a perfect family. But it's such a big job. Yeah, but it'll be a very dramatic transformation. How am I gonna do this in two weeks? With a lot of overnight deliveries and a copious amount of caffeine. And some wine. I'm just used to people being excited to get my help, you know? I mean, people pay me to decorate their house. I can't even give this guy free furniture. Grant just can't picture it. Yet. What'd you say? Grant can't picture it yet? He can't picture it. That's it. What's it? I have not even been following my own MAP system this whole time. When you get off track you need to get back on your map. [clink] Cheers to that. Cheers to that. [chuckles] After you. Watch your step. [phone rings] I'm gonna take you off to the left here, Lisa's gonna be handling all your paperwork. Hold on one sec. This is Grant. Hey, Grant. Uh, it's Bethany Cain. Oh, hi. Uh... listen. I know that we got off to a bit of a rough start last night. Did we? So I was just wondering if maybe you would want to come shopping with me this afternoon to buy a sofa? Okay, great. Make sure they get out with Alan. He's our best guy. Grant? Yeah? Look, Zoe's got ice skating practice at 3:00 at the ice rink so why don't you meet me there? It's Arbour Ice Rink. Okay? Okay. Meaning, abundance and peace. Hello? Hello? Meaning, abundance and peace. Full extension. Make sure you've got some tension here. And through the back. Chin up. Off you go. Hi. Hi. Well, this is a unique meeting spot. Yeah. If I'm not at the office then I'm with Zoe, and if Zoe's not at school then she's usually here at practice. Look, I... I know that you're not exactly over the moon about all the changes that we're gonna be making, but... you know, think of it this way. You're not doing this just for you, you're doing it for Zoe. I would do anything for Zoe, but this all just feels like a giant commercial. I know that that can seem a little odd, but listen. All I want you to know from me is that I'm just trying to make your house a special place for you and Zoe. That's it. But I need you to be on board if I'm gonna be able to make that happen. Okay, well Zoe's got a double practice today and I told her we were going shopping so we've got about two hours. - Let's go. - Okay. Let's get this thing done. So what do you think about this? It's... beige. Well it's actually more greige, or ash but... Okay, so would you prefer it maybe if it were in a darker shade? I just don't understand what's wrong with the one that I have. Well, there's nothing wrong with the couch that you have now, per se, it's just... hey, how about this? Why don't you, uh, try it? Go ahead. What do you think? Yeah, it's pretty comfy. It's comfy! Yay. Okay, so in my MAP system I like to do something called "visualizing your environment", okay? So close your eyes. Come on, please? Okay. Visualize yourself on this sofa in your house. [chuckling] Okay. Why are you laughing? It's just goofy. Can you please try it? Okay. Okay. You're on this sofa in your house. You're sitting with Zoe and she's all curled up. You are excited because you're telling her you went snowboarding- Um, I don't snowboard. It's just an exercise. I'm a skier, not a snowboarder. Well, it's just an exercise. That's all we're doing right now, visualizing your environment. Do you see yourself? Zoe? Sofa? Any of it? Yeah. I can see the inside of my eyelids. Okay. Maybe we should just uh... you can open your eyes. I think that we should just move on from the furniture and we'll try something else. Okay? Do you have a preference here? I don't know. They're all the same to me. They're just pillows. Well, they are pillows but they're not the same, okay? They're different. You have army, moss, fern, forest, lime... Green. It's just all green. Let me try something. Okay, like for instance this pillow right here. This reminds me of the time that my grandparents took me to the park and we had this all day picnic. It was amazing. And this shade of green is the exact same shade of green as the grass. Hmm. Okay, and oh-oh, here. This pillow has got a very luxurious fabric on it so this would maybe make someone feel abundant if they had this in their house. That's the "A" part of my MAP system. Yeah, I don't get the whole MAP system. When Rebecca and I moved into the house we just wanted it to be comfortable. Well, being beautiful doesn't have to mean uncomfortable. Yeah, but being comfortable doesn't need to mean not good enough. Sorry. I don't know, I just like the pillows that we have. That's all. Okay, well we can keep some of those and we'll just add some new ones in. Why don't we move on to lamps? Lamps are fun. Yeah. You know, this could add just a little... By the way, you're not gonna get anything from this. Don't worry, I can edit something together. Come on. Get back out there. You got this. Come on. [clears throat] Well, I was just thinking that this lamp right here, I mean, this could add the perfect pop of colour that we need. Okay. What? Do you always talk like that? Talk-talk like what? Well... You mean like a designer? Oh, yeah. Yeah, I do. Because I am a designer. That's how we all talk, yeah. Got it. Sorry. Yeah, it's great. What're you doing? You don't have to take the lamp just because I said... Here you go. We'll take this one. Oh, um... by the way, I made these for you. What are these? Spare keys to the house. Thank you. I love that lamp! It's great! - It's a nice lamp. - Love it. Yeah. The whole thing is just goofy to me. She asked me to imagine sitting in the sofa, but I'm actually sitting in the sofa, so how am I supposed to imagine it? Would you ask DaVinci why he held his brush a certain way? Maybe. Let the genius do her work, Grant. Joel, you just don't get it. She's turning my house upside down. Well, you haven't really given her a chance. Why don't you invite her to dinner at the restaurant? If you sit down and talk to Bethany about her plans you might feel a little better about the changes. Well, maybe you're right. So that's what I was planning. What do you think? That's a great idea. Yeah? Okay, well... Go ask her. No, Dad. You have to ask her. That's how she'll know you're not mad anymore. I was never mad- Just, just go. It's no big deal. Go. Go. Um, actually, could you put that one back, please? Oh, yeah. We're gonna put everything back, I was just clearing out the cabinets, making room for the organizers. But then I saw that this one has a chip so maybe we toss it? Yeah, no. That one is my wife Rebecca's bowl, so... Oh. Oh, yeah. Of course. We'll keep this. Thank you. Seems we just keep getting off on the wrong foot here. I'm sorry. Yeah, I know. Um, I know how much you've been doing for Zoe and me and I just wanna ask you if you wanna maybe come to dinner with us tomorrow night at the lodge. Start over, say thank you. Uh... yeah. Yes. Yeah? Yeah, I would like that a lot. Okay. Um, let's say 7:00. Perfect. Okay. Um, okay. I'll see you tomorrow. Okay. Yeah. Tomorrow. 7:00. Yeah, 7:00. I'll be there. Okay. Bethany? Hi. Grant and Zoe are waiting for you. May I? Oh, yeah. Thank you. This way. - Hi. - Hi. Hi, Zoe. Thanks for coming. I'll take that for you. Thank you. Thank you. Sure. Thank you for having me. This place is beautiful. I... I can't believe I've never been here to have dinner. Joel even made us a special menu. So fancy. [laughs] Voila, here he is. Welcome. Thank you. We'll be starting off tonight with an amuse bouche. This is an apricot canapÃ© with goat cheese, almonds and rosemary. Oh, it almost looks too pretty to eat. But I will. Zoe, we're making Bananas Foster tonight, you wanna watch the pastry chef set something on fire? Yeah. Is that okay, Dad? As long as it's not you. You be careful. Listen to Joel, all right? Okay, Dad, I'll be careful. Bye. So um, you look really nice. Oh, uh, thank you. You do, too. Thank you. Some wine? Yes. I would love some. Thank you. Great. So, I just have to tell you, Zoe is so excited and she can't stop talking about how much she loves what you're planning for her room. Mmm, yeah I know, she's being very cute about it. And I hate to admit I actually think the kitchen is gonna turn out well. You do? Oh, I'm so glad you think so. You know, I was thinking about something today. I wanna honour Rebecca's bowl in some way so how do you feel about maybe putting it in a shadow box over the stove up against the wall? Hmm. How about this? How about a compromise? In order to honour the bowl maybe we build a special shelf? That way it can still be used. That's not a bad idea. Yeah? Maybe I should be a designer. [laugh] No. No, you leave that up to me. [laughs] That's a good idea. And I've also decided that um, I'm gonna get more on board with things. Yeah? Well, I have decided that I need to be a little bit more sensitive to all the changes that are happening, because I know that there's a lot. Yeah. And I feel like if we could just communicate like this then that would be great and that way there'd be more of you in the house, and that's what I want, you know? That's the way it should be. Deal. To making a house a home. To making a house a home. [clink] Thanks for coming over, Ryder. I just can't figure this guy out. Well, it sounds like you two are finding some common ground. I don't know. We haven't actually done anything yet. Sometimes adversity breeds genius. I just prefer everyone gets along and does what I say every once in a while. I'm a dad. Nobody does what I say. Somehow I'm surviving. Here you go. Thanks. I've just got a lot riding on these next few weeks. I need everything to move smoothly, you know? What if they don't? They have to. But they probably won't. And then you know what'll happen? What? You'll still finish and the house won't burn down and somehow it'll still be better than it was before. Everyone wins. I don't like it when you're all calm and logical when I'm trying a worst-case scenario situation. You know that? That's just what big brothers do. Well, it's annoying. Then my work here is done. [laughs] Seriously, Bethany. You're gonna have to learn to be okay with just mostly perfect. Or you'll go nuts. What do you think this is supposed to be? I like what the artist has done here. There's a... a real sense of movement. Mmm. A bit like an octopus crawling through a Windsor knot. I was gonna say octopus. Maybe a squid? Oh, any of the cephalopods, really. Cephalopod. Nice word. I'm impressed. How much do you think this masterpiece is? Ooh. Ouch. You sure it doesn't do anything else? That is one expensive calamari. Oh, you know, well, it's like my grandma always said. There's a hat for every head. What's that mean? Well, it means there's someone to love everything. Oh. And I do mean everything. Excuse me. Looks like somebody found their hat. [laughs] Okay, so there's a table right up here that I believe actually would be perfect in the... You like this? I do. What do you like about it? Uh, well before I lived here in Windermere my parents had a cabin up here. Huh? Some of my favourite memories are up there. That cabin reminds you of it? Yeah, it's pretty close. My sister and I, we'd go out in the snow and we would make snowballs and snowmen and our hands would freeze. We'd be out there for hours. And that light in the window... Yeah? Reminds me of this huge fire my mom used to make. She'd warm these blankets next to the fire and then she'd have hot cocoa waiting for us when we got in the house. It was great. She still does that. Yeah, it looks peaceful. It was. We should get it. Really? Yes. Are you sure it goes with the whole theme? Yes, it goes with the whole theme because you love it. Okay. Yeah. I can't believe somebody bought that thing. Where do you even put something like that? I've got a couple rusty pipes and a hammer in the garage, maybe I should become a sculptor. [laughs] I'd buy it. Hey. Perfect timing. Your desk just arrived. You should come see. Oh, good. I just thought you'd like to be able to look out on nature. And also something meaningful. From Zoe's room. This is perfect. Thank you. You're welcome. Hello, everyone. How are you? Thank you so much for joining us and thank you for your patience. We're gonna get started in about five minutes. Okay. Thank you. Was that him? Yeah. Arroyo Pass is iced over. The sommelier is not gonna make it. Great. Okay. Uh, you wouldn't happen to have your sommelier certificate, would you? No, but you do. Okay. Uh, do me a favour. Can you entertain them for a little bit while I call Zoe? All right, everyone. While we wait for the wine tasting to begin... [phone ringing] Hi, Dad. You're late. Hey, sweetie. I know, I'm sorry. I'm stuck here at the lodge. Any way you can hang out there for a little while longer? I'll call Joel. He'll come get me. If you can't reach him let me know, we'll figure out something else. Okay. Okay, sweetie. [ringing] (Voicemail) This is Joel, leave a message at the beep. [phone ringing] This is Bethany. Hi. Zoe? Dad's stuck at work and Joel isn't answering. Can you come pick me up from skating practice? Uh, do you think that would be okay with your dad? Yeah. I'll text him and tell him you're coming. I just don't want you to think he's irresponsible or anything because he's a hundred percent responsible. Okay. All right, yeah. Uh, I can be there in like um... ten minutes? Cool, thanks. Okay, all right. Bye. Okay, so where was it? Oh. It was here. This was my favourite part. It's so good. I cannot believe she got out of that. I know! That's exactly what I was thinking. There's so many great things about this book. So good. Hello. Hi, Dad. Hey. Thank you so much for helping out. I really appreciate you picking up Zoe. Not a problem. A little something to say "thank you". Ooh. Cookies. Wow. This is nice. You like it? Yeah. Good work. Thank you very much. I knew you would. Oh, this is just too good to be true. [laughing] - Oh, hi. - What's that? What's that negative comments? I never read those. It's not that. You getting push back from the magazine? Nope. It's not that, either. Well, you're not being very convincing. Ok, it's not that bad, really. Just brace yourself a little, okay? I don't really like the sound of that. What're you talking about? Well, our video updates on the renovation are gaining some serious traction on your website because you and Grant are getting shipped. Where? It's like when people want you to get together like a couple you get relation-shipped. What? Oh, no wait. This one is so good. "It's like watching an old black and white movie "where they argue until they fall in love." Wait, wait, wait, what's that last one say? "Just kiss already." That's enough. This is a silly online thing, anyway. She probably doesn't have that many followers. She's been gaining followers since the contest started. How many could she possibly have? 200,487. Oh, 88. This is what people think? Who cares what people think? It's getting us subscribers. I care what people think. I mean, I don't wanna be- Woah, that is a lot of people. Wow. Yeah. The magazine is very happy with all the attention the contest is getting. They are. Mm-hmm. You, my friend, are trending. [ding] [laughs] I'm trending. Okay, so we're gonna do another visualization, okay? [laughs] Don't you dare. Okay, I'm sorry. Okay. All right. Close your eyes. Okay. Okay. All right, now take this pillow. Now, rub your hands over the pillow. Mm-hmm. Okay. Give me that one. All right. Now take this one, do the same thing. Okay. Last pillow. Do the same thing with this one. Hmm. Now tell me which one of those pillows speaks to you. Oh, these are these new fancy talking pillows. Are you gonna be difficult? No, sorry. Uh, I like the first one better. Okay, the first one. Okay, take this again. Ooh, this is so comfy. Yeah? - That's a good one. - Nice. So we have a winner! [laughs] Okay. Oh, I see. I think you think you're funny. Is that funny to you? No, no, this is very serious business. I'm sorry. I'll be very serious. Excuse me, miss? Can we- Stop! Don't you dare. Oh, you don't want to get this started, Mr. Oliver! Okay, children. What? That's enough. Wa-ha! [laughing] Completely alone, snow-covered tree limbs, little critters running around. Critters? Oh, there he is. I got your coffee waiting for you. Thanks, man. You guys don't know each other, do you? No. Emerson, Joel. Joel, Emerson. - Hi. - Hi. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. Taking a little break from our home makeover shopping. So, how'd it go today? We bought pillows. Lots of pillows. Did we ever. Did you know that there are approximately nine million shades of the colour green? But they are all equally important. Mmm. You're learning. And very enthusiastically, may I add. [message alert] Oh, we've got the update status call with Beautiful Homes magazine. And we still have five more days so I don't know why they're micromanaging. Welcome to the big times, Ms. Cain. All right, guys. Sorry. I hate to caffeinate and leave, but... They're talking about doing an online release before the issue comes out. So I can just pick up the end tables before I come tomorrow morning, will you be there? No, I doubt it. I mean, I was lucky enough to get away today. Lisa deserves to be sainted. But I should be home by dinner if you're still there then. Uh... uh, I can be. If... yeah. Okay, yes. I'll be there. Okay. All right. Good. Yeah. Okay. - Yeah. - Yeah. I will just... see you when I see you. I will see you then. See you then. Okay. We're gonna go now. Nice to meet you. Bye, guys. Bye. Bye. Bye. She has been working so hard trying to get everything done on time. She's great. Maybe you should do something to take her mind off the house for a couple hours, you know? Something just for fun. That's a good idea. What does Bethany like to do? (Both) Work. [laughs] I don't even know if she'd have time for fun. Maybe she needs a little nudge, you know? Sometimes you have to encourage people to have a good time. I don't know when I'd do it. I've got the cross country ski tour at the lodge tomorrow, I've got that snowman making workshop. Why don't you invite her to come along? But then I'd have to ask Lisa to step up again and that's- I'm sure she won't mind. I guess I would be there to put out any fires if she really needed me. That sounds fun. Can I come? Yeah. Yeah, we'll make a day of it. Good idea. Good. Well, I'm good for something. [laughs] Okay, dinner's ready. Thanks, sis. I appreciate you taking care of me while the kids are away. [phone ringing] You can answer it. No, no, no, no. It's fine. But it could be the president calling to ask you to redecorate the White House. I doubt that. What if it is? I mean, he could be a huge- Okay, stop. Stop. ...this home decor. Uh... Hey. Hey. Speaker. Uh, so I changed my mind. Um... about the end tables? Uh, about tomorrow. Yeah. I'm gonna be at the house when you get here. Oh, okay. Uh, great. We have a surprise for you. You have a surprise for me? What kind of surprise? Well, that's for us to know and you to find out. I don't really like surprises. Oh, really? Miss I like to plan my life down to the molecule? Okay, I see where this is going. You're not gonna tell me, are you? Nope. See you tomorrow. Oh, and dress warmly. I love surprises. I know. Not the White House? Uh no, it was not. He just has a surprise for me. Who? Mr. Home do-over? Mmm. He said to dress warm. Do we have to come up with a clever excuse? No. It could be anything. It could be candles askew, you stubbed your toe- Oh, you think I'm gonna chicken out. Who, me? You know what? I think it sounds like fun. And I think you like this guy. What? [laughs] Come on, I do not like him. I think you think he's cute and he makes you like surprises. Just stop. Just stop being ridiculous. Let's just eat. Can we just have a nice dinner, please? [knocking] Hi, guys. (Both) Hi, Bethany. Why are you both looking at me like that? Are you ready for your surprise? Yeah. Uh, should we bring in the tables first? Nah. All right, well... what is going on? Is the surprise out here? Nope. It's at the lodge. Oh. Oh, okay. So we're going to the lodge. You are on a need-to-know basis and we haven't decided whether or not you need to know. Don't worry, you're gonna like it. What're you up to? Come on. Surprise! Okay. Let's go get changed. So why isn't Zoe coming? She didn't wanna take the chance of injuring herself before her exhibition. Injuring herself? Well, how hard are these runs? Don't worry, I'll take it slow. In that case, good luck keeping up. [chuckles] Hold on! Hold on! Something tells me you've done this before. â™ª Do, do, do, do, do â™ª Do, do, do, do, do â™ª Do, do, do, do, do, do do, do, do, do â™ª â™ª There I was skydiving down the avenue â™ª â™ª I saw your red turn into blue â™ª â™ª so I knew I had to talk to you, yeah â™ª â™ª You looked like you've been crying â™ª â™ª Every single day â™ª â™ª I want to wipe your tears away. â™ª â™ª And say do you need a little company. â™ª [phone ringing] Hello? Hey. Just checking in to see how everything's going. You're supposed to be having fun right now, not thinking about the house. I know, I'm just taking a little break in the fun. Have you got the curtains hung yet? Yeah. I'm setting it up right now. How's your day going? Is it filled with all kinds of frozen delights? Yeah, it is. We just got through making a snow man. I haven't done that since I was 10. Then it sounds like it was high time. Bethany! Come on! That's enough work! Let's go! Oh, you know what? I have to go. We're roasting marshmallows. Marshmallows? Ooh, yummy. I'll talk to you later. Bye. Bye. You want one or two marshmallows? Three. Three? Yeah. Oh, the trifecta. There you go. Thank you. Sure. So are you a uh, golden brown or a charred and crispy kinda marshmallow roaster? Well, I'm more of the accidentally catch it on fire kind. Oh, I see that. See? Okay, okay, okay. Put this one down. We'll concentrate on this one. Oh, you're gonna teach me? I'm gonna teach you. Okay. That's perfect. All right. Now keep it about ten inches away and slowly just rotate it. Well, thank you for taking Zoe to skating practice. No, it's no problem. And I'll pick her up after, too, and stay with her until you get back home tonight. What're you two up to next? I haven't quite figured that out yet, but if we don't come back in a couple hours send out a search party. Oh no. Will do. Bye, Dad. Bye, Bethany. Bye. Bye, Zoe. So you really don't know what we're doing? I figured we'd take a walk around the mountain. A walk around the mountain? It's dark. I've got a flashlight. But it's cold. All right. I can fix that. Boom, there you go. Nice and cozy. Come on. So there's this great path that we use mostly in the summer and the spring but it's beautiful in the snow, too. Yeah? I've got my own private little tour. Yes, you do. Oh, wow. Look at that. Come here. See that right there? That's the Orion Nebula. Wow. It's beautiful. Uh-huh. Why does it look so much different than all the other stars? Well, it's actually stars that are surrounded by gases and dust and that's why it has that glow. Really? Yeah. Gosh. They're all so bright tonight. When it's this cold out all of the moisture in the air freezes and that's why it's so clear. Do you spend all your free time on the internet? [laughs] I wish I had free time. No, I like to get out here as much as I possibly can. Stand out under this big sky. It just reminds me of how little my problems actually are. Yeah, well I'll have to remember that the next time I'm in the middle of a deadline. [laughs] So uh, did you have fun today? Yeah. You know what? I have had fun. It's crazy because I honestly thought I'd be freaking out about not being at the house but I haven't. I've barely even thought about the house. Feels good to live in the moment, doesn't it? Yeah. I guess I needed this. Oh, did you plan this, too? Yes, this is all part of my master plan. [laughing] Okay, well let's keep going. Where are we going? Uh, we're gonna follow this path down to this incredible natural cavern. That sounds dangerous. No, no. Don't worry, the bears are friendly. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I don't do bears. Yes, you do. I'm joking. I'm joking. Come on. There's no bears out here. [roars] Stop it! Brought you back in one piece. [laughs] Yeah, I guess you did. Well, I had a great day. Yeah, me too. Um... you know what? Stay right there for one second. Wait. Where are you going? What? Wha... That's very sweet of you. Thank you. You're welcome. Follow me. Wha- Uh, uh. Follow me. Come on. What are we doing? Watch your step. It's so dark. I know, I know. Okay. Stand right here. Okay. Hold on. Hold on. All right. And... Wow. I didn't know we hung these yet. No, no, no. I did it last night. You did it? Yeah. Don't worry, I checked with Emerson first. Said it was okay. Of course it's okay. Oh, wow. Look at this. You did a really good job. They're beautiful. Thank you. Well, we wouldn't have any of this if it wasn't for you, so thank you. Aww, you're welcome. However, I think maybe I should get you some heaters, too. [laughs] What else? [chuckles] Aww, thank you. I got you. Nice and cozy. Thank you. Yeah. [door opens] Ah-ha! Oh, uh... I'm so sorry! I thought it... I thought it might be a raccoon. Uh, no, no, no, no. No problem. I was just leaving. I have to get some sleep. I missed a whole day of work so a lot of catching up to do, so... I'm just gonna go back in the house. Goodnight, guys. Goodnight. So, well, yeah. I should get going, but I had a really great day. Thank you. - Me too. - Yeah. I'll see you tomorrow. Oh, here. Your scarf. Thank you. Bye. Goodnight. Goodnight. What're you doing? Hey. Hey. Why are we meeting here? I could have just brought you a coffee. I mean, we gotta get to the house- I know, I know. I just wanted to talk to you before we got to the house. Uh-oh. Why do you look so serious? Grant. What about him? We almost kissed. I knew it. You do like him. But I don't wanna like him! Why? Because! For starters, he clearly really, really loved his wife. I mean, what if he's not ready to move on? Oh, and then not to mention I'm working on his house. Yes. I'm a professional and I'm trying to build an empire here, you know? I'm gonna have big meetings, I'm gonna have to fly away, this is all gonna be very complicated. No, it's not. It's not! Okay, look. Let me break it down for you so it's less complicated, okay? Okay. Yeah, sure. Do that. His wife passed before her time. So he will always love her. That's what makes him a good man. And it doesn't mean that there isn't room in his heart for you, too. Look, sometimes... sometimes things just happen unexpectedly. It's a bit of a surprise. I don't like surprises. I know you don't. But they're not all bad. They really aren't. Why do you make so much sense? [sighs] Okay, this is the part where I'm supposed to tell you you're brilliant, listen to you and follow all your brilliant advice? Yes. We're at that moment. [laughing] I love you. I love you, too. Thank you. Any time. Now let's go finish this house makeover, okay? - We're late. - Yeah, we are. - We gotta go. - Yeah. Here we are at the end of another project. I don't know. I think I wanna revisit the hardware in the kitchen. I don't know if it's a hundred percent. [laughs] Bethany, we have to finish. The magazine wants pictures like yesterday. Well, I'm sorry. This stuff is too important to rush. Well, they're very happy with all the traffic we've gotten to our website and they wanna harness that momentum to launch the online spread. Okay, well then they can just give us a few extra days. Oh, honey, we don't have a few extra days. [laughs] And besides, the viewers they just wanna know how the house turned out and what happens next. Well, I don't know what happens next. Maybe I uh... maybe I write a second book. That would be good but I was talking about you and Grant. Oh yeah, there's that, huh? Yeah. I don't know. I'd like to know the answer to that, too. Aww. Hey guys. Hey. I nailed my routine today. Coach said I embodied at least a duck, that is almost a swan. I am so close. [laughing] That's awesome. Hey, you should come to my exhibition. Uh... I don't know. Isn't that just for family? We'd love it if you could come. Right, Dad? Yeah. Yeah, you should definitely come. Okay then, yeah. Yes, of course. I would love to come and watch you. Great. I want to thank all of you for coming to support your skaters today and see their progress. They've all worked really hard. The first to skate today is Zoe Oliver. [applause] [laughs] Come on. [knocking] [classical music begins] â™ª She only started skating three months ago. Aw, you must be so proud. This is her warm up. She looks great. Oh, I love this part. I love that part. She looks so good. Uh-huh. Okay. Okay, now she starts. She's doing great, having done this for such a short period of time, huh? Oh, she looks good. Yeah. She definitely didn't get her coordination from me. [laughs] She's gonna win. She's gonna win the gold medal. No, no. It's just an exhibition, there's no medals. What? It... She would win if there was a medal. Okay, yes she would. All right, this is the big finish. Yes! [applause] [cheering and laughing] [clapping] Yes! Come on, guys. It's not like I was skating in the Olympics. Well, I still say if there was a gold medal then you would have won it. [laughs] Oh. Okay, Zoe. Now this is your spot. Okay. And you get to organize this however you like. Okay. Good job. And Dad, this is your spot. Who's the extra spot for? Well, today that would be me. Oh, look, guys. Just a few more things to do to get the house perfect for the magazine spread and, more importantly, for the both of you. Yeah. [laughs] Yes. So later on today they'll be coming by to take the pictures for the magazine and then um... And then after that you're done. Yeah. That's it. It'll be weird not having you around all the time. Will you come back? I hope so. And so our New Year, New Home transformation is finally complete and I've done my very best to help Grant and Zoe turn their house into a home using my MAP system incorporating meaning, abundance, and peace into their living space. Cut! That was great. Uh, Zoe? Grant? Do you mind coming in? Oh, Zoe I love that dress. Wow. You guys look great. Thank you. Okay, are you ready? Yeah. Okay, don't be nervous. - Okay. - Okay? You talking to her or me? [laughs] And we're rolling. So I'm here with the Olivers and I just wanted to take time first of all to say thank you for letting me come into your home and do all of this. I know it wasn't easy some of the time so thank you. And I just wanted to ask you both um, what was the experience like for you? What was your favourite part? I love my new bedroom and your hot cocoa. My hot cocoa is good, I will say. [laughs] Uh, for me it was all the free furniture. I figured that was the answer. I'm just kidding. Actually, the best part I think for both of us, especially myself, the best part of it was having you here. That was the best part. Um... wow. Uh, well thank you. Thank you. That means a lot. Uh... I've never had that answer before. Uh, well, uh, you heard it here. We're finally finished so... thank you. [laughs] Thank you. And cut. That was great, guys. Uh, let's take some pictures. Hey, can I grab you guys? Over there on the sofa. Come on, guys. All right. Yeah, that looks great. Ready? And... [photo snaps] We got it! That's a wrap! Amazing. We did it. Can I change back into my normal clothes? Yes. You can get out of these fancy clothes. Make sure you hang them up. Quick learner. Yeah. I learned from the best. Uh, do you guys feel like staying for dinner? Maybe we order some pizzas or something? Uh... yeah. Yeah, that would be great. But no pizzas. Let's cook. It's more fun. Ooh, fancy. [laughs] I'm gonna help them pack up and drop them off at the studio. I can be back here in 30 minutes. Sure. That's perfect. - Great. - Thanks. - Yeah, of course. - See you soon. Thanks. So uh, I don't know, do you want to make some pasta? No way. It's Taco Tuesday. Tacos it is. Sounds like it. Ah, hold on one sec. [phone rings] Oh, that's Lisa. I'm gonna grab it in the office. - Okay. - Excuse me. Hey, Lisa. Uh-huh... Okay, yeah... This is so cool. I've never made tortillas from scratch before. Yeah, well they're actually pretty easy. And to be honest with you, they're way more yummy. Okay. I think we're all prepped. Good. That's a great job. Uh, okay. Now we have to brown the meat and then we'll cook those, and in the meantime I'm gonna make a salad so could you grab me a cutting board and a bowl? Yes. Thank you. Great. [smash] Oh! Mom's bowl. Oh no, no, no, it's okay. We can fix this. Dad's gonna be so mad at me. No, he's not, no, he's not. Hey, you guys okay? Uh, yeah. What happened to mom's bowl? Uh... it's my fault. Yeah, I... I was going to wash the lettuce and then some water sprayed on me and I backed into her and I knocked it out of her hands. Dad, it wasn't- And she tried to catch it but it was too late. Look, let me help you. I know... Just stop, okay? Stop. I'll handle it. Rebecca wanted to do so much with this house. This was her dream house. She didn't get to do any of it. Sorry for that. Dad. Let's just do dinner another night, okay? Hey, hey! The magazine showed me the pictures from today, they look so... good. Everything okay? Dad, you have to listen to me. Hey, Zoe, um... why don't you just give me and your dad a second, okay? Where's the glue? Where's the glue? The glue was in drawer. It's always been in this drawer. Sorry. Thank you. Grant, I-I... I'm just gonna go. Hey, Zoe. I don't want you to worry about anything. We can fix this, okay? Promise? Yeah, I promise. I promise. And he is not mad at you. Just give him a little while, okay? Okay. Are you ready? Yeah. He'll get over it. He just needs time to process. Are you okay? Uh, I don't know. Dad? What's up, sweetie? I have to tell you something. It's about Bethany. Look... It's late. But Dad- You should go to bed and we can talk in the morning. You always say that when you don't wanna talk about grown up stuff. [chuckles] Should we say your mom's prayer? (Together) God bless this home, god bless this girl, god bless the people of the world. Teach us to love the way you do, and trust your love will see us through. Amen. Amen. Okay. Goodnight. Goodnight. Goodnight. Goodnight. Good morning. Morning. It turned out great, huh? Yeah. You should just call him. Hey, you want some tea? Bethany, I- I've got some great tea in here that I think you're really gonna like. It's chai. Okay. You ready? Your session's about to start. Dad, I have to tell you something. Okay. It wasn't Bethany's fault the bowl broke. I put it on the counter and it fell off. Okay, well... thanks for telling me. So now you don't have to be mad at her anymore. We can all be friends again. I think it's a little more complicated than that. Why? I don't even know if she wants to be friends. Did you ask her? Dad, you have to tell Bethany you like her. But just do it. Don't be all grown up and confusing about it. Okay. Get out there. Your practice is about to start. You're like a guru. It's my fault. I'm fine. I should have known better than to get in a relationship, you know? The contest is over. I just... I gotta get my head back in the game. You could try to work things out with him. Mm-mm. He doesn't want to. How do you know? You kinda just ran away. I didn't run away. Do you intend to go back? No. Then that's away. The running is just metaphorical. I know but you don't understand. That relationship came with so much baggage and I would have been over my head. Bethany, I've seen you take places that are falling apart and turn them into something wonderful. That's different. Not really. It's just that you know you can do it, so you aren't ever scared. [sighs] Yeah. I don't know where his head is. Exactly. You don't know. You know, if you stare at that too long you're gonna get those strobe light things in your eyes, like when you look into a flash. Let me ask you something. What do you really think of Bethany? I think she's great. It's just all the changes at the house, the stress here at work... it just all seems so crazy. Is there a point in here somewhere? Zoe and I have just been doing so well lately... I don't know. I'm just afraid to upset the apple cart. When did we start talking about apples? You know what? You're right. I'm not ready. Woah, woah, woah. Hang on there one second. What? Don't pretend like I'm the one convincing you not to take a chance on Bethany. I'm not trying to pretend- You've got a million excuses but I'm not gonna be one of them. What're you talking about? I don't have any excuses. You can't stop time, Grant. Life just keeps going. And it's time for you to live it again. Stop burying yourself in your work and stop hiding behind Zoe like she's the reason you can't move on. I know. All right. Then do something about it. Are you okay? It's just Sullivan. You don't wanna sound like a robot. I know, I just um... have to remember to talk about the book and to mention the contest. I can't forget about the contest. Okay. Can we be present for a minute? Okay, but they're getting ready to call me, so... Yeah, I know. I know. Do you see where you are right now? This is everything you've ever dreamt of. The TV show, the magazine, the book. You've worked so hard to get here and look at you. You're miserable. You're missing the one thing you need. [knocking] We're ready for you now. Okay. All right. Be right out. Meaning, abundance, and peace. Meaning, abundance, and peace. Hey. Meaning, abundance, and being present. I'm ready. This way. [applause] Welcome back. As promised before the break, Bethany is going to give us the lowdown on the Oliver family New Year, New Home makeover. Yeah, uh, well, they were great. I mean, the Oliver family, they were a real pleasure to get to know. Well, I'm sure you know the question on everyone's minds. Yes. You can find out where to buy all of the furniture in the home on my website, BethanyontheMAP dot com. That's not it. We all wanna know if there's really something going on between you and Grant. Oh, uh... [laughs] Um... no, no, No, there's not. I actually haven't spoken to Grant since the contest. I'm pretty sure you're disappointing a lot of our viewers. Oh, well how can I make it up to them? Let's take a question from the audience. Okay. Oh, the gentleman over there. Uh... this is more of a statement, really, than a question. Go right ahead. We're all ears. Uh, Bethany, we miss you. I miss you. You said you were gonna help turn our house into a home, but it can't be that unless you're around. So I just wanted to know if you were willing to come by for dinner. I'm making pancakes. Well, I don't know. I mean, I've got a very robust schedule, you know?
