- Should we get some competitors out? Pardon? Should we get some competitors out? - You really don't know what to expect when you get there. You'll be surrounded by some of the best baristas in the world. These are the best of the best, the cream of the crop. And they're all representing their country. They're all hungry to do very well in this competition. And that can be very stressful. - It's super, super intense. To make it to world, you're already one of the better baristas. You're the best barista competitor from your country. When I won the title, initially, people treated me different. I think there's the expectation that when someone wins a title that everything changes. Oh, that man has a title now. Oh he must be taken more seriously. I had a guy in here take a selfie with me one day. It was weird. He like tanty on the counter, he's like, you're the Irish barista champion. I kind of like, I am. And he's like do you want to take a selfie with me. I was okay. This is weird for me that someone wanted to take a selfie with me. I just found that so bizarre. And I kind of really awkwardly like. One of our most regular customers took it upon himself one day to write a poem about my coffee shop a proper order. And that's the name of the poem, proper order. He starts talking about me in the poem, and you know, He starts talking it's hard not to feel it. - Morning Niall. Can I get a flat white, please. Innocently, he took over solicitors. Striped the back and painted gray, laid hardened oak, handmade, and an oversized window that shed light on this proper order. Loving Dublin highlighted this, Dublin loving and roasters like playlists change with moods. This is the birthplace of the caffeine inquisition with an ala carte menu that became his carte blanche. Opening too early and closing too late, this dream transformed his life in ways unforeseen. There are no baristas here, only friends, and they'll slap and tickle if you order properly. Accidentally he took over an industry, stripped it back with childish play, created bespoke memories, a gentle perfection that illuminates this proper order - As a kid, I always used to get nervous about what other people thought of me. Of course you still get nervous when you're about to go on stage. But I love to remember the wet room, so it's this exhibition at the Natural History Museum in Berlin. It's a room within a room that's made out of glass. And it's just huge. When you look at it, you feel small and inferior. If I don't want to do what I'm anxious about, if I don't want to go onstage and I'm freaking out, like I can't do this, I just picture myself in one of those creepy, cylindrical glass bottles. I may as well just be in there if I don't do what I'm meant to be doing. There's no point to being scared of life. - Tasting is a huge part of what makes me who I am, and it kind of irritates my wife to a degree because I like, she'll ask me how dinner was. I have this thing were if people ask me a question about how something tastes, I kind of go into it like coffee taster mode, and I just begin to analyze and like let them know what I'm thinking in my head. And sometimes those things aren't positive. Smells kind of like blue cheese. - He has an amazing palate. And I think that's where the competition is all about. You have to not only know your coffee, but you have to explain why they're tasting what they're tasting. And if you don't have a palate for that, you're gonna suffer in this competition. - I've hurt my, I hurt my wife's feelings a few times just being pretty honest about I hurt my wife's the way things taste. - It is both frustrating because I'm the one that cooks for him, and really fascinating. I love the way he tastes things. - Let me do this Grim Reaper in the like avalanche size. - I get kind of like jealous that I can't taste things the way he tastes them. - This is like green apple, tangerine and blue raspberry. It has a lot of acidity, and it's pretty fruity. That's one of the things that I've really drawn to love about coffee is that coffees can be comprised of such complex acids. But yeah, being at that it's not only like my livelihood being a taster, but it's also like a thing that I can't turn off. - Hi. Welcome to Coffee with Brian, brought to you by, Sanremo coffee machines. - So, you want to be a world champion barista. Well heres a few things that you'll need to know. Baristas will need to make 12 drinks in 15 minutes, four espressos, four milk beverages, and four signature drinks for a panel of, a panel of judges. Baristas will receive points for how accurately they describe their coffee's flavor notes to the judges. Competitors will loose one point for every second they go over time. Anyone that goes a full minute over time will be disqualified. A barista's signature drink may include any ingredient you wish. The ingredient must complement the coffee, and create a new flavor experience. You may not use alcohol. Here's a good one. Judges may assign points for inspiration, passion and originality of a barista's routine. In conclusion, people often say your best is good enough. Sometimes those people are wrong. Winning this competition is gonna be tough. But think about this, how good would it feel to be the best in the world at something? Right. - That's my bad. I'm ready to talk whenever you guys are. Cup A. I liked it. I got a little kind of cooked fruit, and some stone fruit on it. - It's a little dry. A bit like dry and crispy. - Cereal fruit, like fruit cereals. - Oh, you mean like fruity pebbles kind of situation. - Kind of savory, still like juicy, citric, right. Still good sweetness, but had like this onion kind of like herb quality coming back. - Very minor amount of savory, so it also. So it wouldn't be my favorite. - This would be a coffee we could serve out like holding up over the long term. - What did you think of D? - Interesting one. Not one of my favorites. I feel pretty confident it's not gonna hold up. - Yeah. Yeah, that coffee scared the living crap out of me. - These were probably selections that we made in Panama that tasted really amazing, like super fruity, really bright and floral that haven't held up. It's a little bit disappointing in that the fruit is really kind of like fallen apart. - I guess I'm unique in the fact that being synesthetic, when I taste the coffee, it's like a little flash of color. Some people are gonna watch this and go your man's talking shit. He does not see color when he tastes the coffee. But I do. So like when I taste the coffee, you know, for example, we have natural Coast Rican on the bar at the moment. That is like bright pink with a black line underneath it. But it's got like a wavy texture. And I know now, like after a couple of years in the coffee industry, that that is, you know, cherry's dark chocolate and the wavy texture is like a natural. Like it's funky. I don't talk about it anymore because it becomes one of those things oh, taste that. What color is that? With my synesthesia anyway, when I taste something, sometimes it can be like a blessing, and sometimes it can be a curse. So sometimes I can see something in a coffee that maybe other people wouldn't taste. So like there might be a little green, a couple of green spots down in the corner. And I say what is that. It kind of makes me look into things a little bit more. But then other times, something will appear and it's like this big band of color. I'm like I don't know what that is. I can't figure it out. It helps me probe a coffee, but then sometimes it can be really frustrating if I can't figure out what it is. That one would be like way more compact, still like a lot of the favorable, like really, really kind of blueberry dominant. And when I tasted it, it had like golden sparkles in it. Magical. Definitely. Taking that one. All right. We have a recipe. Here we go. - He wants nothing but to compete. I mean I don't know if it's a swimming background. I don't know what he was like as a six year old, but I wouldn't want to have been in the same playground as him. - I just remember, you know, my mom bringing me to a pool was one of my first memories, and just being thrown in. And from the age of 15, swimming just started to get really, really serious. I was lucky enough to be flown all over the world for swimming competitions. I think most of my life has been defined by my career in swimming. The whole swimming thing is ingrained competition in me. When I stopped swimming, realizing that what I had done, and done really, really well in my life so far, just wasn't for me anymore. That's a tough thing to do, like something that my whole life was dedicated to, just realizing that I didn't enjoy it anymore. - From the day one, he wanted to be the best. He's almost his own worst enemy. Sometimes his ambition outweighs his ability. - I am naturally a pretty competitive guy. Last year, it was the qualifying event in Kansas City, and like I prepared really, really well. I had this amazing coffee, and then something happens on stage, and apparently the shots just tasted awful. I scored really poorly. I didn't qualify to even compete at nationals last year. Defeat is really difficult. And missing the mark, like it shook me to the core. - I really just stress so much for him. Because I know that he stresses out so much, and I hate to see him anxious, and worried. And he's kind of, he can be sort of, what is the word I'm looking for, like inconsolable. - Personally in my own life, and in the life of my family, we struggle with clinical depression. And that's like a thing that is real in my life, and it's like, it's most definitely the hardest thing. - This dude wasn't gonna compete again after he didn't do so well in qualifiers last year. And he was very down on himself, down on the competition. Dude is really hard on himself. He sets the bar really high for himself, and then when he doesn't hit it, I mean he just beats himself up. So when he said he wanted to compete again, I thought that was super, super inspiring. - First place, United States Barista champion, give it up for Kyle Ramage, the current USA Durham, North Carolina. Give it up folks for your new champions representing the United States in Seoul, Korea. - Having people in my life that love me and correct me when my mind is just wrong, like my wife is a great grounding force in that, and Lem helped me just try to stay grounded in knowing that I have worth, and I have meaning, and that they love me. - It all started just from being in a small town in Australia. And my parents split up. They got divorced when I was 15. It was a lot of shit taken out on me. Yeah, anyway. They, yeah childhood. I guess Berlin will forever be the place that I became an adult. It definitely was the first place that I was alone for the first time in my life, moved from my family with my partner. Moved to Berlin, and then all of a sudden, he wasn't there and I had no one who I considered family. And that was a really hard time. But, It's just the place I learnt to be alone and go after what I wanted. And I have made my family here. It just feels like home now. - In terms of Miki's personal life, I think it's pretty tough. Because it's Miki's the one who's competing. Me? It's okay, you know. I go training and say what I need to say. And I go back home and I eat dinner, and I sleep. But for Miki, she need to work really hard even after heading back to home. She need to work on so many things. And she need to coordinate so many things. And her personal life, I think it's all about coffee now I think. It's 100 percent. - Wow - What I hate about barista competitions is how boring everyone's set up is. It's all made out of wood. And it's like, all like the most unstimulating things you can find put on to tables. I wanted to have a really good representation diagram that was engaging, and actually quite cool to look at. Your example. I know okay, it looks more complicated than it is. But, also the colors, like if the colors match my cups. - It should be colorful, that's the whole point is that everything's colorful. It's like making specialty coffee fun and not boring as shit. And I thought a popup book would be really cool because it's just like everyone loved, I loved that as a child, like loved it. - Turns out they're very hard to make. And whilst my boyfriend is very talented, I wouldn't want to put that pressure on him to try and make this giant, complicated popup book that pull tabs, and oxygen comes out. And like pull tabs, and green beans come out, and they split. So we're looking into other avenues now using the same concept, but just not so complicated. Is it possible? Are you a genius? Can you do it? - If you want clean underwear for the next month, you don't have a choice, no. - Yes. - Thank you. He's so understanding. I could not imagine being with someone who's competing in one of these competitions. Like you're fucking crazy. - My life changed the most when I heard Ali say I do. Being Irish, you're always like filled with self doubt. So I it's really, really nice to get the pat on the back from Ali to be like you're a good guy. You're worth spending the rest of my life with. I wouldn't be the Irish barista champion without Ali. In my preparation for the championship this year, I was like rehearsing, rehearsing, rehearsing, and really kind of like not enjoying the whole process cause it was just draining. Ali pushed me to do better and better and better. And yeah, if it wasn't for Ali pushing me forward to do it, I would have just packed it in two weeks before the competition and withdrawn. - We've really grown up together. Like I think one of the dumbest things that we did was we graduated from college, two weeks later we got married, and two months later we moved 800 miles away to North Carolina. - 800 miles away with like 1200 bucks , I think we had. - Oh yeah, we had like $1200 in our bank account, no job prospects, and we were so broke. And I remember going to bed that night thinking like this is our life. Like we're gonna be poor, broke, grad students for the rest of our life. And we just need to pack up and go home to Mississippi because this is not, this isn't gonna work. And so to look back on that like moment of disparity now, and see how far we've come because of Kyle's hard work, and dedication, and success, and love for the craft of coffee, and his passion, I mean it's just, it's the most humbling thing ever. It really is. - Yeah. She said it pretty well. I don't know. It's been hard, but it's been fun. - I don't even know what worlds can bring for us, but I know it's huge. I made our flights in such a way that we don't have to fly out of South Korea the day after cause I fully intend to be celebrating all night on November 12th because my husband is the new World Barista champion. - No pressure. - I don't know whether she has a boyfriend or not. I don't even know. Like I can't really ask. I feel responsible for that. - Here we see Chloe Nattrass practicing her lines for the World Barista Championships. Each competitor has 15 minutes to be able to produce a lot of really technical information and still make 12 drinks. So knowing every single one of these lines can really pay dividends. Let's watch. - This results in an incredibly clean, sweet espresso with an amazingly bright acidity, in my opinion, a perfectly balanced espresso. And yeah, so right now it's just workflow and making sure everything's timed right, and getting a loose. Cause last night, I got a little bit high, and read through my speech again, and was like delete, delete, delete, fuck that, fuck that, fuck that. And I rewrote half of it. And it's better now. - Okay, once from the top. Do you want to go, do you want to start from the top? - Firstly, I freeze my coffee by "liquid nitrogen." - That was good. Liquid nitrogen, liquid nitrogen, you want to combine together. Liquid nitrogen. Liquid nitrogen. - Liquid nitrogen. - Yeah, good, good. - Liquid nitrogen. - Good, good. - Liquid nitrogen. - Good, and same as before. Double grind, you combine together. Double grind. - Double grind. - Good, good. - Double grind. - Like that, like that. Janet Jackson. Janet Jackson. Janet Jackson. Sorry. Janet Jackson. - Janet Jackson. - Janet Jackson. Say Janet Jackson. - Janet Jackson. Janet Jackson. Double grind. Double grind. - Good, good. - What we talked about last week was with the hands were a little bit floppy a bit vague. You didn't know what to do with them. All I said was to keep them down, unless you're gonna use them. Use them to enhance, and to emphasize what you're saying. And you did. So much more going on with your hands, you were telling a story with your hands as well as your eyes. That was great. And of course, the content of what you were saying too. So I was very pleased where there's much more going on, much more confidence, much more presence here. Just a little bit sunk in your lower body. Be proud. Be very proud of the work that you're doing. You're not Irish Barista champion for nothing. And you want to scale up those heights again. So it's fantastic work. That first 30 seconds, really enjoy that cause that's the hardest and the nervous, very nervous beginning. - So I always start with a hello. Hello judges. My name is Niall, and I'm the Irish Barista champion. - Hello, my name is Niall. Hello my name is Niall. I'm the Irish Barista Champion. I'm here to talk to you about this and that. You didn't have to, my name is Niall. I'm the Irish Barista champion. The last important word dropped away. - Okay. - And we need them, especially when you're nervous, to get them to have a bit of weight. - Just kind of cut the bullshit. - No pleasantries. - Yeah, no pleasantries. It's like okay, he's talking about something. I need to start listening right now. So if I'm like on this side, and you're like delivering that message, I'm gonna be like okay, he's talking about something. What is he talking about? - Well I've kind of composed myself a little bit, Get it back together. And time. 16 months ago, Christopher Hendon and Maxwell Colona Dashwood, along with a few other specialty coffee professionals in the United Kingdom got together to conduct an experiment. It's both qualitative and quantitative. - I don't want you to get too scientific with them. - People always remember the sciencey stuff I talked about because it's kind of interesting and cool and different, but a lot of the things that are getting really high scores for them are that I kind of hook them with the scientific thing, and then I showed it with a beautiful coffee. - Right. - If what I give them is good, they're hooked. - Every barista can explain flavor notes. But when you explain why you're tasting cherry, why are you tasting lime, why are you tasting florals, you connect that to the farm, to the processing, making it unique, yeah. There's a lot of people in competitions in geishas. but this is why this geisha is unique. - So just thinking about easing a load of tension in your jaw. there's about four exercises we can do. And very simple ones. Put your finger there just underneath your ear. Yawn. Now just explore that little gap that has opened up here. That temporomandibular joint. Watch how just gently, just very gently with your finger, other direction as well, open that space and think about space from your upper molar teeth and your lower molar teeth. Now with the heels of your hands, come down and let the lower jaw go. Let the tongue go with it. So you've turned into Edvard Munch The Scream Good. Think that was silly? This is very silly. Interlace your fingers. You're gonna shake here, relaxing your wrists there. Work there, release here. Now do one, two, three, four, five like this. One Two Three Four - The secret drink is the part of the competition where the barista gets to express themselves and maybe their culture, or their place they live, or things that inspire them. It's really one of the only places where we get to control everything. So I want to figure out how I could augment and amplify both my own personality, as well as the personality of where I live. I chose to use a hops, because North Carolina is known for having a vibrant beer community. I also choose to use a local honey, just showed a little bit of the character of the place where it comes from. Please don't sting me in the face. - It won't. If you look on this side, check it out. You see all the pollen on their hips. You see those bees with the yellow pollen pockets? - Oh Yeah. - That's how they carry pollen. - Little bags. - Yeah, it's like, they're like cargo shorts. They're like a bunch of mini-dads, but they're all girls. - I'm using a really like floral hop for brewing beer, and then a floral honey, and floral coffee to make, to like come together to make another floral substance. - It tastes really good actually. - It's like really caramely and like, like a really caramelized sugar, like caramel or almost a vanilla. - Ah, I got stung. I got stung. - Hey, first sting. I actually don't remember what it feels like to get stung. Oh, there we go. - Did you get one too? We lied to them. - Ah, there's another one. Yep. - You alright, it's on your hand? - Yep. - You doing okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. - Do you want your gloves? - Yeah- Nah.fine. - You sure? - Yeah. - Heck yeah, it hurts. - Smoke them. - You got one on your beard. They're trying to climb in your beard actually. Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry buddy. I'm sorry buddy. - Just like - I freaked out. - Step back, I know. - I freaked out, I'm sorry. - The first time I saw him compete, I think it goes back to that thing where he competed alone, he kind of, he could have asked a lot of people for help, and maybe always on your first time, you don't know who to ask for help. So I think he, if he had to come to us or anybody and be like I'm gonna need a champaign flute, honey and chocolate on stage, we would have been like no. Never do that, ever do that. - I went to put a little bit of honey on the rim of my glasses and it just went everywhere. It like poured down the side of the glasses. I was like cleaning off my fingers. The only thing I didn't do was like lick honey off my fingers that year. - You did-- - Yeah. - You put that honey on that glass, and it just ran down that glass. - Never again. And then with my like disgusting looking glasses that were like covered in honey, I decided it would be great to add chocolate powder to this. But instead of like using cocoa, I decided to try and grind some nice chocolate on stage under hot lights. Chocolate gravel stuck to runny honey on the side of a champaign glass. - I was just like oh my god. What's he doing? - So the resulting signature drink had a delicious raspberry puree, some nice natural Ethiopian, and it was just this big fucking mess pouring down a glass. - I was just like, oh god, just like this is a train wreck. It's the thing I come to coffee competitions for. - The funny thing about a barista competition is you still smile at the judges and say enjoy. - So that's maybe, that's maybe a thing I remind Niall most that you need to lower that ego a little. Like do you remember the champaign flutes? - Scotty. - Yes. - You get the hot water for the cascara? - Of course. - There's a big chip in this glass. - That's good that we got loads of spares. - So no to that. Okay. It smells like cascara. - That's weird. Oh fuck. - You fucked it. - Should we put something on top of it? - How long do you think we should brew it for? - Six minutes. - You think so? I'll get a microbrew so you can taste it. - So it's nice just to have somebody to be able to ramp to, and ventilate your ideas. Usually it just involves us getting drunk and coming up with super weird ideas for signature drinks, like the amount of signature drink ideas we've come up with like over about four more beers, every extra beer you have, you just like, no now, like what we need to do is like melt sugar and then do this. Let's use like a salad spinner to make some coffee sugar. And then everyone wakes up in the morning, you're like what the hell were we talking about last night. No one even writes it down, as well, so you can never even remember what the idea was. I think a lot of like our best ideas have come when we're drunk and then we've completely forgotten them. We could have a completely like world winning presentation between the two of us, and we have absolutely no idea. - It's just like the ripest peach apricot. - Smell this one. Wow. - I think we could even go for like the higher dose, less water. - And bring the fruit out more. - Where do I find that balance of like sweet, salty, or bitter, and acidic and all these flavor compounds coming together. How can I find that? Tanith explores flavors unabashedly. She explores flavors that maybe I wouldn't think to explore. I really want to kind of lean on her and see if she can find something that kind of brought a little bit of taste of place kind of concept, to like bring something with me from North Carolina that was special. - Here, chew that up, spit it out. You don't have to spit it out, strictly speaking. It's good to eat. - It's very. - Sour, right. - It's real sour. Pull just a little bit of juice out. It's like super sweet, and really, really floral. - It's pretty good. - It's really good, actually. - Yeah, it's like nature's candy. - It's like a raspberry almost, kinda sorta. - Yeah. The thing with extracting flavor from honeysuckle, - yeah, it's a little bit bitter. - It's super bitter. Here, let me try this thing out. Oh, it's super goopey. I'm a texture person, this could be bad. - It could be bad for you. - Yep. - That's great for me. These are good. - Careful. The results of anything we've ever foraged have always been better than anything we could have bought. Like you can buy fig leaves, you can buy lavender, but like something that's had to like weather a storm is flavorsome. - That's pretty epic. It shouldn't be as easy as going to a supermarket, I don't think. - No. - Especially when you're using coffees that are like the best of the best, you know. - Yeah, well if you think of like the effort it takes to find a great coffee, why not put the effort into every little element. That's for you. - Thank you. - You get that, like slow sweetness from it as well. - It's super, super bitter. - A tannin that you need to wash your mouth out. - They're not good yet. - This just tastes better. And as well as going to the shops and getting something doesn't have a story to it. It doesn't have anything about it. It doesn't have adventure. - We're able to incorporate like half of the flavors that are available here into a signature drink. - Kind of that terroir style-- - That would be awesome. Yeah. - That's cool. - These are so good. Can we go find more? - These have been picked by hungry men. - A couple of scandalous men. - It was the horses, the horses ate them. - Oh my god. I think I just, I pressed the wrong setting and it started too fast. I don't want this to happen in Seoul. The seal on this isn't perfect. Oh, have you ever seen anything more frightening in your life? This is why I shouldn't do it when it's hot It Expands. fuck. - Judges. - Judges. - Your signature drink is inside here. - You must crack it open. - It's got that sherbet thing again though. - It looks fucking horrible in that glass. I'm not sure if that was too much citrus in it. Alright, scrap that. - Well? - Don't know I just kind of want to eat one. - Something far too erotic about figs. We were even like joking about it today that the amount of times I've nearly snapped at her. I don't think I've ever like properly shouted at Chloe. But I'm just like slowly writing down everything on a list. Like for now, I don't want to say anything to her just cause I know that's she's a little bit on edge, which is normal. - I don't think they're ripe enough to make them taste like anything. And I'm not gonna be able to get figs in Korea anyway. It's just a dream. - You could ship them. - What? I'm not shipping fucking figs to Korea. That's like the dumbest thing I've ever heard. - As soon as this competition's over, I'm gonna just reel all of it off and just be like that one time you said this, fuck you. This time, yeah, that wasn't good. But I think it's nice just to have someone just to bite their tongue sometimes and just take it. It's like having a punching bag, I think sometimes. You just need to be like, oh, everything's going wrong. And you just throw something at someone. - Yeah, fuck signature drinks. - She puts enormous pressure on herself and she, the goal is to win, obviously. The goal is not just to do her best, and to go from, to try again next year. The goal is to win. Not only me, but there's a kind of a core group around her that's supporting her, but how, what we can do to make sure that we do our part to help her win. - Ready, let's kick this off. One more round of applause please. - Give him a hand please. - Our first competitor. - I just wanted to make you a delicious tasting beverage. I have 16 mils of an orange marmalade sugar syrup. Now my grandmother makes delicious orange marmalade. It's very simple to make. You take oranges. You peal the skins. You put it in salt water for two days. Remove it. Put it in fresh water for one more day. On the third day, you poke a hole in it with forks to release the flavor, and cook it in a simple sugar syrup at 90 degrees for four hours. - Karo was roasted with a higher temperature at the start. 190 celsius degrees because of the higher density of the beans. - Now, lets make a happy ending for the whole story. Let's blend all together until the foam disappear. Let's take a second sip, very nice. In addition to the flavor we taste before, we got a new flavor, cherry, even though we didn't add any cherry flavors. We also got a bergamot that reflect characteristics, and also the chocolate. So that whole idea of blending bring everything together to create more possibility. I really wish you guys enjoyed. And this is my time. - Everything we do here is striving for enoyment of coffee that's meant to be shared. - Time. - Time. - Time. - That's my time. - Time. - Time. - That's my time. - Time. - Time. - Time. - Time. - I was not ready. I was freaking out. I think I just gave myself an anxiety attack. The speech was not finalized until the day before. Just making sure I didn't forget anything. That's the worst fear of mine. So time. Hello, welcome. My name is Chloe, and I'm very pleased to finally be here with you today. The novelty in specialty coffee that inspires me, the new, the original, and the unusual. We are every growing, ever changing, and ever learning, I think is incredibly special. I brought a coffee with me today that encapsulates all of this for me. It's La Punta, sugar sweet processing from Sumava de Lourdes Monte Llano Bonito in the west valley of Costa Rica. Sugar sweet is an anaerobic processing method, as you can see on your, your cards, meaning there's no oxygen in the fermentation tank. Please now sit back, relax, have a read, and I'll be back with you shortly. Welcome. If I have a lot of excitement and like adrenalin, I will start to talk like really fast. And then I start saying too many things at once, and then I can get confused like a small child. So this is 21 grams of espresso. If you'd please jot down some flavor notes for your espresso. Raisin, brown sugar, a low bitterness, a high sweetness, a medium body. Do I even bother trying that hard because I'm never gonna get, I'm never gonna win. And then you get through these points where you're like no, crap, I do have a good presentation. I can totally win this. I'll be back shortly with your signature beverages. Thank you, enjoy. I have 15 grams of this intense raisin liquid that I've made by rehydrating organic raisins. I have 10 grams of fresh grape juice, of white skinned table grapes. And I have seven grams of cold brew tea, jasmine green tea. And of course, my slightly cooled espresso. Now it will be a cold, refreshing beverage with 40 grams of ice, at 60 PPM to bring out that aroma and create texture as the ice shards break with the help of my little shaker friend here. And I'm just gonna press play. Don't be alarmed. So he's here with me today for consistency and workflow, so I get to have a little bit more face to face time and tell you how these ingredients effect my coffee. So cold brew tea is an attribute of this amazing floral quality, bringing freshness to our drink, and also adding flavors of papaya, and ripe plum. So I'll just go get your beverage and I will be back with you shortly. Alrighty, so those flavor notes one more time so they're a bit more clearer for you. White sugar, coffee blossom, papaya, ripe plum, and that lingering jasmine finish. Alrighty. Thank you for joining me today, guys. I couldn't have had more fun. And I hope you've enjoyed it too. La Punta is one of the most exciting coffees I've ever tasted. And I hope you understand this novelty concept is to bring us further into the future with our customers and ourselves. Thank you. Time. - Yeah. Time. It was a rough day for me. This is a very bad performance for me. I didn't well prepare. So many things happen the same time. I didn't make my good performance. - The instant before my routine starts, I always have this little thing of ah, you know you can walk off now anytime. Just tell them you're not feeling great. you're in the world championships, if you're not nervous, your just like you're really underestimating the challenge that's ahead of you. Like, you know, you're representing your industry in your own country. If you're going to world championships kind of going "I've got this," fuck off. - Ladies and gentleman, everyone round of applause for the barista champion of Ireland, Niall Wynn. - Time Hi guys. As baristas and cafe owners, we've taken inspiration from the competitions. It has helped drive us forward as an industry and lead us on to greater things. Over the last number of years, we see an increasing number of coffees brought based on their ability to wow us. And they do exactly that. The coffees that I've brought here today is a coffee that I hope is going to wow us, one of those exceptional coffees, and in the next decade, transition to be an everyday experience that anybody can enjoy. So the coffee that I'm using today is from Colombia from a farm called Finca Inmaculada. This variety is known for it's silky smooth texture, juicy acidity, and complexity. And the coffee I'm serving today abides by all those rules. With the first sip, you will expect that lemongrass flavor again, and blackberry. The second sip will get lemon and peach. And on the finish, we're going to experience dark chocolate. But that flavor doesn't last too long. Enjoy that lemongrass aroma, first of all. And then I'd like you to stir it really, really well and pop your spoons in the little glasses here right in front of you. You're almost like watching yourself from above. You've got this like downward view on yourself. It's like pure adrenalin when you're up on stage. You're just hoping like, you're hoping you remember what to say. Then everything else goes according to plan. But it never does. In order for me to do something that I'd never done before, compete and do well at this stage at the world championships, I needed to form a collaboration of my own. To do this, I embrace the help of a chef in Dublin. For my signature drink today, is I've chilled my espresso. So what that does is two things. It intensifies the flavor, but also it means that it's more open to receiving flavors. I'll be adding just two drops of a lemon verbena oil. I've made this oil using lemon verbena from my parent's garden, believe it or not, and I've infused it into rapeseed oil, Irish rapeseed oil. I'm going to add seven grams of Dublin one honey. Finally, my whole signature drink is going to be pressurized with nitrogen. Thank you. To give it that rich, velvety texture that we wanted. I think that these baristas championships here are a really, sorry, are an amazing opportunity for us as baristas to bring something unique to the attention of our whole industry. With your first sip, you should expect, sorry, I'm getting ahead of myself. We're going to experience that lemongrass aroma. With the first sip, you're going to get lemongrass, and blackberry again. The second sip, we're going to get lemon, peach, and honey. And then with the final sip, I'd ask you to finish your drink and enjoy the aftertaste. It's dark chocolate. Thank you very much guys. It's been a great pleasure serving you here today. And that's my time. You weren't talking to anyone. That was the issue. And you have four people in front of you that you should have been talking to, but you were talking more with your machine than with those people. That's the main issue. - Yeah. - But at the same time, just look at it positive and say that it's easy to improve to the next round. So your scores are gonna be way higher next time, which technically is a good thing. - What I'm telling Kyle now, especially what I told him in nationals is be yourself. You're not competing against anyone in the barista competition. The only person that you're competing against is yourself. - Big round of applause for the barista champion of the United States of America, Kyle Ramage. - I'm not gonna puke, it's okay. Let's get into it them. Time. Hey, I'm just calling to check and see if you still had dry ice. I know it's a little late in the day. Time. - Our first competitor to the final, the barista champion of Australia. - Our second finalist who will go second tomorrow is the barista champion of Hong Kong. - Okay, I'll do the next one. Can I have music again? Please? I can't do it. Oh thank you. The barista champion of Japan, Miki Suzuki. - Our fourth finalist in the 2017 World Barista Championships is the barista champion of the United States. - The barista champion of Canada. - And to complete our set for the 2017 World Barista Championship finals, the barista champion of the United Kingdom. - I told you we believe you. - I knew I didn't get through as soon as I came on stage. As soon as I started, really, looking at the judges' faces. I was just relieved to have been finished, to be honest. I just don't know where I would be without specialty coffee, without coffee in general, I think I would be lost. I'm not sure what else I would have done. Nothing else I really wanted to do after I started making coffee. - The best piece of advice I think was given to me by my dad. And he always said to me, no matter what it is you do, you should always do your best. He then said sometimes your best is not enough to win, but that's okay. - Where are you, Hong Kong? Let me hear you. The barista champion of Hong Kong, Kapo Chiu. - I have this non-alcoholic whiskey barrel aged honey. And of course, there's four shots of espresso, which I have chilled down. I'm adding on to dry ice to create that French earl gray tea aroma in which I'm going to inject it into this whisky bottle for three seconds. - I kind of put on this like weird, overly cocky kind of persona. I think everyone's worst self if the self that they are at competition, cause we're usually like bugged out and like not sleeping, and not eating well, and all those things. So, I don't know I'm not that guy. I'm not a super cocky, know it all kind of dude. Maybe I fail. Maybe that's my own misconceptions coming through. A friend of mine, Nathaniel May, put this on Facebook a couple years ago. But it was like when is everyone gonna find out that I'm faking it. - Miki Suzuki! Okay, are we ready to go? World Barista Championship, finalist number two, the barista champion of Japan, Miki Suzuki. - Time. Espresso extractions are usually trade off. But I get something positive, I lose some espresso extraction. However, I have discovered a coffee that made me want to bring all the positive into one cup. I name it double grind. First of all, I'm adding the 20 grams of liquid nitrogen to 44 grams of coffee. Next, I'm adding another 20 grams of liquid nitrogen to coarse grind the beans. And then, I'll grind again for espresso. The flavor in first sip, mandarin orange, bergamot. And the second sip, brown sugar, and black tea finish. I'm serving the espresso in my custom made cup that I designed for today. For my signature drink, let's discover the new flavors in my super long extraction. I added point one grams of freeze dried lactic acid, and five grams of freeze dried honey. I didn't want to add in any additional water because I didn't make it too watery. That's why I make it freeze dried. Adding just touch of lactic acid enhances the grape and apple flavor. Honey give it sweetness to balance it. And I'm adding lavender aroma by using aroma diffuser. This creates a synergy with the liquid, and bring out the peach flavor. I use vacuum mixer to remove the seal to remaining in the espresso. This creates a synergy with the liquid, and the bring out the silky texture. The flavor you can find grape, red apple, white peach, and black tea finish. Along with the perfect cup, I also strive to provide every customer for perfect coffee experience. Time. - The Barista champion of Japan, Miki Suzuki - I have a 50/50 blend of raw sugar and freeze dried manuka honey. But to make this work, I do need to lightly caramelize the sugar with a quick flash of heat. And I found no better way than to use a fairy floss machine. So right now, we're caramelizing those sugars. We're changing that structure of sweetness. A little bit out of control today. It's gonna give you this beautiful peach note in the signature. Would you please write down peach. - This is the sip that I first fell in love with, the first taste of geisha, many years ago. I cupped it like this, and swirl it, and swirl it, and swirl it, until it melts. It could take a couple minutes, but this is well worth it because there are new geisha flavors locked inside these cups. Now, I really like working with liquid nitrogen because it always reminds me of winter back home in Canada. - Squeeze in a little bit. We're all friends. We use 88 grams of espresso, per the recipe you just tasted, with four grams of a pre-washed Japanese Oolong. I've used 125 grams of hot water, with 30 grams of lacto fermented cacao nips, which I then strained over 60 grams of ice, dilute and chill. Now I fermented these for three days in a solution of a sour dough culture that I've been cultivating for six years. And I'm gonna cool all the ingredients with frozen rocks. So your first sip, creamy mouth feel. 80% dark chocolate, thank you, and then the finish that oolong bitterness. Then I want you to wait 30 seconds before you take your second sip. Then you'll find balanced orange cream soda. Now you take your first sip as soon as I serve this to you. It has been my absolute pleasure to be here in Seoul. Thank you. Time. - The barista champion of the United States of America, Kyle Ramage. - The finals, right. Awesome. Didn't realize my mic was on. Deep breath. You guys all feeling good? - Yes. - Wonderful. Let's get into it then. Time. Two years ago a computational chemist named Christopher Hendon had the idea to take specialty coffee, freeze it, grind it, and the prepare it as espresso. And what he and his team of specialty coffee professionals found is pretty astonishing. The graph in front of you represents those results. In the cup, this is truly everything we're all searching for, cleaner, sweeter, and more balanced. But, don't take my word for it, let's try it together. Be right back. It is what it is, and the time didn't work, which is mostly just for pacing. I just like to be able to look at it and glance and be okay, I have four and a half minutes left, 30 seconds left, especially towards the end. Like it's very helpful to that I know how to pace the closing thoughts. In these six tubes, I have six doses of three different, truly stunning geisha coffees all frozen to negative 79 degrees Celsius. Let's get these ground up, and we'll talk a little bit more about the coffees themselves course by course. Be back. - So I'll tell him over and over again, slow down. Work fast, talk slow. - 12 years ago, the Gallardo family, had the idea to plant this new, experimental, and somewhat untested, but highly regarded coffee variety on the highest elevations of one of their farms. What you will experience today as white flowers, like jasmine, fresh citrus, like lime, stone fruit, like fresh cherry. The body on this coffee will be light to medium and silky. And the finish will be long, slightly herbal, but pleasant, like a tonic. The sweetness with medium intensity, and like a light wildflower, honey. We're gonna break protocol today, stirring this coffee 12 times in order to bring the beverage temperature down to where I feel like it shows these flavors most clearly. Enjoy. So to start, 120 milliliters of that colibri espresso. To this we'll be adding three simple ingredients and one process to augment and uplift those amazing flavors. The first of which is 35 milliliters of a mosaic hop tea. Mosaic hops are used by brewers in their India pale ales to give them their incredible floral complexity. The second ingredient, 12 milliliters of a North Carolina dark honey simple syrup. The last ingredient is 30 milliliters of a tartaric acid solution, a juxtapositional acid which is not commonly associated with coffee, but rather with grapes. Today we'll be combining those stone fruit like flavors to vest new ones that are more tropical and exotic. Charged with nitrous to give us this amazing texture and body. It also helps to mitigate some of the more intense flavors from the hops, making a more balanced drink. When you get the beverage, you'll notice the flavors have been transformed dramatically. Intense bergamot aroma, passion fruit, lime zest, with a finish that is long, and again very much like a tonic. It's my honor and true pleasure to be able to present to you the culmination of over 12 years of ideas from a coffee producer family in Panama to a scientist in the United States. It's ideas like these that have spurred me on and I hope will spur the next generation of thinkers to create the next idea that will change the face of specialty coffee forever. Time. To be in that elite group that is the top six at the WBC finals, it's amazing, but the kind of people who compete in these competitions are incredibly competitive. So you want to win. - Anybody in that top six has potential to win. I feel at that stage, its about like who messes up less. That's a game of tight margins. It's just about who is that little bit better. - Should we get some competitors out? Pardon? Should we get some competitors out? Should we get some competitors out? Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, welcome to the World Barista Championship's award ceremony, 2017. Over the last four days, you've seen 58 national champions compete, each representing their country to compete for the title of 2017 World Barista Champion. So the time has come. In sixth place, the barista champion of the United States. - I thought I had done really well, the judges thought otherwise that my drinks really didn't hit today like they'd hit before. It was pretty disappointing cause you want to win, and you're never happy when you don't win. And in that moment, it was hard. There are things you want to take back and redo, of course. And that's just life though. - Fifth place of 2017 World Barista Championship, Hugh Kelly from Australia. - In fourth place, the barista champion of Canada. - The third place winner is the barista champion of Hong Kong, Kapo Chiu. In second place, the barista champion of Japan, Miki Suzuki. - And the 2017 World Barista Champion, Mr. Dale Harris. - You take away this passion or enthusiasm for something small, and you apply that in whatever your doing in life. And this, this, this sense of mastery and this continuous effort in doing something, I suppose you look at that and you, you go I'm very far away from mastering what I'm trying to master in my life.
