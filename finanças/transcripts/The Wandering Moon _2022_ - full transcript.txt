This subtitle is dedicated to Thalia, an avid fan of Tori Matsuzaka, who passed away on 13-Oct-2022. May she rest in peace. Wandering Know him? - Yes! - The pedophile. Never heard of him. 2007, right? - When we're born... - Right. That one? Yes, he is! Look! On the right... - We can see his face! - That's the pedo guy. Who ordered hamburger steak? The police saved the girl. Watch this! Be careful, it's hot. All orders out? Enjoy the meal. - He brainwashed her. - Scary! Pedophiles should be hanged. -So true. Fumi! Fumi! Want one? Oh... Are you okay? I haven't smoked in a long time. It choked me. You look pale. Actually, I don't smoke. Sorry. I know, right? Next stop, Namiki. Coming! - Welcome! - I'm home. I was sweating from head to toe. Wait for a while! Clean yourself first. Thank you for your hard work! Good grief. Is that curry? -Yes, your grandmother sent vegetables for us. You like curry. Grandma really pushed herself. What? Dad called and said Grandma wasn't feeling well since yesterday. That's worrying. You should see her. How about you, Sarasa? She wants to meet you. Yeah, right. Country people like father and grandma... ...might be surprised by your past but... ...they'll approve of our marriage. They'll forgive you once they know. Sunday, huh? I'll tell Dad. I have my shift on Sunday. What? We agreed to have the same holidays! Sorry. No one's there. So, I can't refuse. Nobody takes part-time jobs very seriously. You're mad? About the marriage. No. But... I didn't expect it. I've been thinking about our marriage. But you don't need to worry about it. Leave it to me. Ryo. I'm not what you think. I'm not a person to be pitied. I know. Don't stare. It's scary. Sorry. 'Cause you're sleeping like you're dead. Now, I feel alive again. How should I call you? Fumi Saeki. You can call me Fumi. Mr. Fumi Just Fumi. Okay. Fumi What? Is this what you want? You always sleep that long? I haven't had much sleep lately. Life was okay when I lived with Mom and Dad. Now I'm considered a nuisance by my aunt. Where are your parents? Something grew in Dad's stomach and killed him. Mother ran away with her boyfriend. Mr. Fumi Fumi You didn't say ice cream wasn't dinner. - You want it. - I didn't think you'll allow me. Sarasa That's my name. Sarasa Kanai Sarasa-chan. Just Sarasa. Sarasa Fumi Can I stay here forever? Yes. Really? Sorry, you have to cover my shift. No problem! Anyone know a nice guy? How about our manager? Possible. Here's the order. -Thank you. Sarasa is finally joining us! Correct! You always go home. Sorry. She has a boyfriend to take care of. You discussed that with her? No, I heard she discussed her shift with the manager. Said she can't work on Sunday for her boyfriend. Of course! Is he the controlling type? I guess he's worried because of my past. Isn't it? No, it's because you're pretty. I would be worried too. Hey. Hello! They don't know how lucky they are. They sit gossiping while their husbands work! I envy them! I'm a single mother. I worked nights at the bar. Your life is also difficult. Sorry but I searched you. Okay. I saw it on the news as a kid. That's big news! What did I say wrong? I'm used to it. - Can you get used to it? - You can get used to anything! How about a drink? Really? The name is Carrico or Calico or something. I'm pretty sure it's a bar. The sort of place that serves chic cocktails. The upstairs of an antique shop. Have you been there? -Not yet. There it is! Cool, right? Let's try. Amazing. Yeah. I'll have a look. Sorry! It's a cafe. I thought it was a hidden bar. Want coffee? Anything is fine. We can eat sweets. Hello. It's an odd place for a late-night cafe. They only serve coffee. Can we order? Have you decided? What do you want to order? You don't have beer? No. No cake either? I don't think so. Can I order number one? Then... I'll get the same. Yes. See that guy? He is so unfriendly! Let's drink the coffee and go. Okay. It's a Baccarat wine glass. This is for wine? My father drank whiskey in a glass like this. My father used his glass to drink shochu. Dad said even cheap liquor tastes good in that glass. Do you know? Maybe it's your father's. Things are like humans. We meet, part, then meet again. Can I take it? A moment. Thank you Your number one order. Hello. Sorry, I'm late. Have you eaten, Ryo? You have to work overtime again? Yes. They need people urgently. I'm hungry. Sorry. I'm going home now. Ms. Sarasa Yes? Can you come here for a second? How is your relationship with your boyfriend? Sorry? Wait! That sounds bad. I'm not harassing you. Someone called last night. He claims to be your fiancé and asks you about... ...the schedule of your shift. Since it was confidential, I didn't tell him. Sorry, I have troubled you. No problem, but... You think it's really him? Maybe. Okay. I'm jealous of you. He must love you. He may be controlling, but that's a form of love. Women like us need a reliable man. He has a good job and his father owns land. He's the ideal man. I think so. -He is! Without a family to rely on, we have nowhere to run! Without a good man, it's hard for us to function in society. When you rent an apartment or go to the hospital... ...a friend will never be your guarantor. I envy you! Finding love is hard with a child. You're loved and happy. I hate you! Anne of Green Gables Poetry by Edgar Allan Poe From childhood’s hour, I have not been as others were I have not seen as others saw I could not bring my pa.. passions from a common spring You're too young for this. Let's eat. Let's eat. And spinning! Ready! You want to try it? -No, thank you. Then, in my childhood, in the dawn of a most stormy life, was drawn from ev’ry depth of good and ill The mystery which binds me still We have the name of the missing 10-year-old. She is Sarasa Kanai, a resident of Kashiwado City. She was last seen on the 26th of last month. After school in the afternoon... ...she was seen at the park with her friends. She has been missing since then. Her school bag was found in the park. According to the police, she may be the victim of a crime... Should I go home? You can go home anytime you want. I want to live here. But you might get caught. Is that okay? No, but... ...a lot will be revealed. Revealed? Things about me. What things? Things I'd carry to the grave. He comes to my bed at night. Who? Takahiro. My aunt's 14-year-old son. After the adults went to sleep, I heard the door open. He touches me everywhere. Asking him to stop is futile. I just hope he goes quickly. That's all I can do. I deserve 100 spanks for this. Number one. Hello. A moment. What's good? What did you order, Sarasa? Number one. That one. Yes. This place is unusual. I didn't know you liked hanging out in cafes. Sorry. Don't apologize for coming to the cafe! How do you know? Thanks Let's buy a coffee machine. Nice machine with good coffee beans. You have many choices. Ryo. Did you call the restaurant? Why don't you ask me? Your attitude is weird, so I'm worried. Weird how? Working late and going to the cafe. Is that weird? Yes. It's not you. Ryo... What do you know about me? You have changed, Sarasa. You never challenged me before. Total is 1300 yen. Thank you You coming? I'm sorry, Ryo. Sorry. Are you okay? Are you not going home? I don't want. Want to come... ...to my place? Okay. I want to. Thank you We have a family vacation to China. In a restaurant, they slaughtered turtles on the spot. I can't bear to see it. Why? I'm afraid of blood. But you're a nurse. If it's for work, I can tolerate it. Excuse me! I... I saw you in my cafe recently. Who is she, Minami? Customer. Did you see the moon? Moon? Very good. I'm so happy for you, Fumi. Fumi, Is life difficult to like little girls? Life is harsh, whatever your inclinations. Police. -Is there any incident? What is it? Let her go. Fumi! Calm down, Sarasa. -Fumi! Calm down. Fumi! Fumi! Fumi! Ryo... It hurts. Grandma fainted. What? She was sent to the hospital yesterday. You must go. I can't go home without you. Okay. I'll come with you. Thank you, dad. -Thank you. Can you smell the aroma? -Very sweet. Hey, Izumi. We just arrived on time. You went to the hospital? Yes. I'm relieved Grandma is okay. You brought your girlfriend? Yeah. - I'll go over there and take a look. - No need. With my parents. -No, thank you. See you. We'll be right here. See you. Ryo, I'm worried... ...when I heard about her and her past. Yeah... I'm glad to meet you. You had a tough time as a child. But you turned out to be strong and simple. I'm not worried about anything. She made Grandma happy. When she saw Sarasa, she immediately perked up... ...and say, "Sarasa. Sarasa" It blew my mind. I bet you cried when you saw Grandma, Ryo. Shut up, Izumi. You have to do your wedding while she's still alive. She can't travel. -Right. Try searching for local wedding halls. Is your boss going to attend the wedding? Don't care about them. He'll take over the farm. It hasn't been decided yet. You two discuss it. Isn't that bruise by Ryo? We all know. My parents, Ryo's father... I hate everyone hiding it. So, I'll tell you. We suspect Ryo was rough with his ex-girlfriend. His ex also has a complicated past though not as extreme as you. Ryo always choose your type. I think he thought your type wouldn't throw him away like his mother did. My type? A woman who has nowhere else to run. Are you okay? I'm fine. Stop it! Stop it! Are you okay? Look at this. We thought twice about showing this to you but... Sarasa Kanai (10) Fumi Saeki's whereabouts! Isn't he the one who kidnapped you? Shouldn't you go to the police? He might be nearby. Anyone can find out where you live from the internet. You must act quickly. Are you okay? Fumi.. Come open the door if you're in! You didn't cook? Let's call Uber Eats. Forgive me. I'll fix something. What is it? I'm going shopping. To Fumi Saeki? What? Why? What's with him? Now he pretends to be a cafe owner. Ryo... You know about Fumi? Men like him have nowhere to hide. He'll soon be caught. Sarasa Wake up! You have to accept reality, understand? Are you... Ryo? Fumi's photo.. You uploaded it? Wait... No, right? You have no idea... You have no idea how hard it was for Fumi during this time! Ryo! You know what you did to Fumi? He finally found a way to be happy! Why did you destroy it? This is wrong... What's with 'Fumi' 'Fumi' 'Fumi'? What happened to you guys? That pedophile kidnapped you! That doesn't make sense! That doesn't make sense! Why? You'll betray me too? You'll throw me away too! Is that so? Say something! Stop messing with me! Tell me, why is he better than me? Don't mess with me! Sarasa... Sarasa Sarasa Stop it. Stop it! Why? I don't want it! Is it okay if it was him? I hate it. Fumi, look! Moon! Fumi! Run... Run! Hurry! Go! Run away! Sarasa... You belong to yourself. Don't let anyone own you. Come on, let her go! Don't panic. -Fumi! Calm down. -Fumi! Fumi! Fumi! -Calm down. Fumi! Fumi! Fumi! Fumi! Fumi! Are you okay? Yes. It's not as bad as it seems. Want to come to my place? Okay. I want to. You stopped pretending not to know me? I think it's better to stay apart. Then, you show up like this. Sorry. I will go. Do you have a place to go? You can stay here. I know you hate me, Fumi. Why would I? -Because I... I... Sarasa That time... I screwed up everything. I failed to convince the police that you didn't do anything. Or about him... I tried to tell them about what Takahiro did but I can't. No one can do that. What's happening to you now is also my fault. Your photos are all over the internet... This cafe too... I want to apologize to you all this time. I'm ready to die if you tell me to. There's no point in living. But... I'm still alive so... ...I can see you again. Fumi What kind of girl was I? You used to be very free-spirited. It was overwhelming. Fumi.. You look the same. But you've changed a lot inside. You can now be with a grown woman... ...and love her. Sarasa Do you still eat ice cream for dinner? No. I'm not a kid anymore. Someone watched me from the veranda. What? You noticed? So, it's Sarasa. Sorry. I wanted to ask you before I moved. What for? You can live wherever you want. Are you not bothered? Are you going to bother me? No. If so, isn't that fine? I want to stay by your side, Fumi. It's next door. I feel alive again. That's the Sarasa I remember. I guess I'm different from the old me. I can't live like that. I'm not strong enough to live alone. I'm trying to be in a relationship with a man... ...who loves me. I think he'll accept me as I am. But you know how people are. They only see what they want to see. Besides, I'm not good with that stuff. What stuff? The things you do in intimate relationships. That's something that repels me. But of course, I can't say that. I try so hard not to show it but... ...it's not something you can hide. I know. How can you? I just know. New perfume? You noticed? So, by the way... Man and woman. You know how complicated it is. Not that I want to snatch other people's husbands but... When he said, "I left my wife for you..." I feel the thrill... Thrill? Yeah, you know that thrill? You don't understand? Anything you like? I'm fine. Do you know? When you think you should stop, you're already in it. There he is! Money! -You already gave me. Are you sure? Thank you. Rika. Hug your mother! I'm gonna get a new daddy for you, okay? I will give you a souvenir. Shisa! See you. Thank you. Bye bye. Hey! I'm coming! Can I go up? Will Rika be okay? Three nights only. She'll be fine for a week. Is she? -Of course! Have a good time. Bye bye! Who is hiding there? Stop! Go away! Watch out! Gotcha! Thank you. You're so considerate, Fumi. Really? Yeah. I'm glad you decided to come. It's scary to be alone. What did you do after that? You must have been through a lot. I'm locked up at home for many years. What? After I was out of juvenile centre... ...I wanted to work but my parents were against it. They locked me in the shed in the backyard. What for? A righteous woman like my mother could not forgive me. Or maybe she's just anxious. But she did feed me. Every day at the same time. But now I'm free. You live with Saeki? I want you back. I forgive you. What for? What am I being forgiven for? What? You... Have you forgotten what he did to you? Listen, Ryo. I'm not a person to be pitied. You're sick. You should never forget that past. Even if that is true... ...it is none of your business. Stop messing with me! I won't not give up. It's over now. But I thank you. For loving me. I tried so hard... I tried to love you, Ryo. Who... Who asked you to thank? Sorry. I... I'm bad for you too. Are you okay? Wait. I know you... She doesn't know that I'm Fumi Saeki. I tried to tell her... ...about my past but I can't. I haven't changed a bit. I can't connect with her. Fumi, you mean... Fumi... You're still... I want to treasure... ...what I have with her. Sorry to bother you... You don't have to worry about anything. I should take a day off. You can go. I'll take care of her. Hi. Sorry to contact you so many times. I wonder when you'll be back. Contact me. I'll wait. Rika tries hard not to show how much she misses you. Poetry by Edgar Allan Poe What are you reading? Poetry Collection It contains many poems. You like poetry? I've read it a lot... ...when I have a lot of free time. You didn't have a job back then, Fumi? I've been locked-up for a long time. What were you doing during that time? I was thinking. About what? About someone separated from me. Every morning, I wonder... ..."Where is she now?"... ..."What is she doing?"... ..."Is she doing fine?"... Also at night. Was she your first love? Who knows. I'll keep a secret from Sarasa about that. Thank you. Read me poetry. You're too young for this. Come on, read it to me. From childhood’s hour I have not been as others were I have not seen as others saw I could not bring my passions from a common spring From the same source I have not taken my sorrow I could not awaken my heart to joy at the same tone And all I lov’d... I lov’d alone... Then—in my childhood in the dawn of a most stormy life was drawn from ev’ry depth of good and ill The mystery which binds me... The mystery which binds me still... From the torrent, or the fountain From the red cliff of the mountain From the sun that ’round me roll’d in its autumn tint of gold From the lightning in the sky as it pass’d me flying by From the thunder, and the storm And the cloud... From the cloud that took the form of a demon in my view Yes, the mystery The mystery which binds me still... Fumi, look! Moon! 15 Years Later, a Predator and His Victim Fall in Love? Excuse me. I'm sure it's fabricated. We're just making sure. So, this guy kidnapped you when you were a kid. You guys are not dating, right? We've been contacted by the media. They want to interview you. You can decide what to do. It's basically your choice. But Ms. Kanai, as far as the company is concerned... ...we'd prefer our company to remain anonymous. Sometimes... ...I have a desire to go back to the child I used to be. I want to be what you want. And whatever you want to do... ...I want to fulfill it for you. If you feel pain, I will feel your pain with you. Because only you... You're the only one who lets me be myself. I wish... ...you'd let me help you, Fumi. Pedophile Fumi Saeki in Room 607 and his insane victim who lives next door! Death Sentence to Pedophiles Is this where you work, Fumi? Yes, it is. What is pedophile? Someone who couldn't love an adult woman. Then, it's not about you. Eh? Because you like Sarasa, right? You're right. Cool! The pedophile's at crime scene! You're recording! He's staring! He's staring at us! -Come on! Wait, guys. The famous pedophile, here! Fumi Saeki Kidnaps Sarasa Again and a New Girl! Thank you for everything. You've been so good to me. This is wrong. Some people might talk... ...but not everyone. There are people... ...who really care about you. Are you behind all this, Ryo? Come in. Are you not satisfied harassing us? You use that word for anything you don't like. It's not me. Do you realize how many people are disgusted by you two? Aren't you going to work? What? Don't tell me you're worried about me? When I'm with you... ...you make me hate myself even more. Thank you... ...for everything you've done. Sarasa! Ryo! Ryo! I've seen the magazine. When I found out about you two... ...I almost threw up. I can't believe I love a man like that. I mean, she was a little girl! Minami. You know from the start, right? That I can't accept you. That's why you didn't tell me. You never... You never trusted me, right? It's enough. Go. That's enough... I want to ask you one thing. Is that why you never sleep with me? Hey? Am I right? You are right. I like little girls. But I wanted to know how it feels... ...with adults. Sorry, I took advantage of you. The man with Rika, isn't he Fumi Saeki? He goes by the name Minami, his mother's maiden name. Am I not here with Ryo's case? Magazines and tabloids are very crude. They implied that you offered Rika to him. Come in. We confirm that it is self-inflicted. He'll be fine. I'll go... -Just a moment. Hey. Bring in Fumi Saeki for questioning. He's with an 8-year-old who needs protection. No! Wait for a while! I told you! Fumi didn't do anything. Come on. We're talking about Fumi Saeki. You know what kind of person he is more than anyone. I'm Officer Hino, Youth Services. Are you Rika? May I talk with you at the police station? Fumi Saeki. Please accompany us to headquarters. Follow me. I don't want. You know why we're here. Come. Come on, Rika. Are you listening? No. I don't want! Fumi! -Hey! Saeki. Fumi! -Saeki! Fumi! Let her go! Fumi! Let me go! Let me go! -Don't resist! Please! That's enough! Let me go! Pin him down. Let me go! When I was little... ...you planted a tree, Mom. It was a weak sapling. You said it was a failure... ...and dug it up, remember? So, you've not developed well? Am I to blame for your disorder because I gave birth to you? According to you... ...am I a failure? Mom Don't turn away. Look at me. How can I make up for what I did to you? It's my fault you got hurt. I ruined your life, Fumi. I know it... But... Part of me wants to be with you. This is so selfish of me but... ...I have to be with you, Fumi. That time... ...you held my hand in the lake. That feeling... ...when your hand touched mine got me through all these years.. Years passed... ...and I never grew up. When you grow up, Sarasa. Because I'm the failure... I'm the sapling. Because of my disorder... ...I can't connect with anyone. The closer you get to me, Sarasa... The more I get scared. About you finding out... But Sarasa... ...I want you to know about that. I know. Sarasa There's ketchup on your lips. You even smeared it. Sorry. Are you sure? If you're with me, wherever we go... If someone finds us... ...we'll just wander again. Takarir ini dipersembahkan untuk Thalia, penggemar setia Tori Matsuzaka yang meninggal dunia pada 13 Oktober 2022.
