“Uguisu School” It took time, but I got you now. Up close, I see she's got a killer bed. Fuck! What the hell? I sneeze when seeing hot chicks! Hey! Hold on! Where'd she go? Where is she? Over there! I found her. What are you doing? I'm sorry! Panty flash! Huh? Loincloth. Dumbass! For fuck's sake. “Nokomura Demolition” Hey, YOU! You carved up 8 people yesterday too, right? Why? Even I don't know. Why'd they attack me? I'll report this to the school! Your name and class! Senior, Class A. Giko Nokomura. Bloody Chainsaw Girl Returns: — Revenge of Nero "Public Bath House” Feels Good. Those with reason to attack me... "Demonlition Monthly" Are you done already? It's all bent. - It sure is. - That much? "Wakita's Chainsaw Sound” I love the sound of Wakita blades rotating. Why would someone attack me? More mutant cyborgs! Stop! I go for it. You black masked nutjob! Die! Die! Die! There's seaweed on your lip, bitch! You never learn! If I wasn't so woozy, I'd floor you! Fool! How long were you in the water? You must be nuts! What the...? Get over yourself, Giko. You'll be like us one day. One day? If you're gonna do it, do it now! That's not up to us! Then who? It's a secret, but I'll talk. Mistress Nero is the one. Nero? You mean, Nero Aoi? Yes! Why's her name popping up? It's a secret, but I'll talk. It's because she's your enemy! We've never spoken. Why does she want me dead? It's a secret, but I'll talk. Your lips are too loose: Haven't you any pride? We just obey her orders! We're expecting some leniency for spilling the beans. Actually, she's... Hey, you two! You gotta be fucking kidding. Why's her name popping up? It's a secret but I'll talk. It's because she's your enemy! It's because she's your enemy! That chick just doesn't get it. I kill you! I'll kill you, kill you, kill you! I'll kill you and I'll kill you and I'll kill you and bring you back and kill you again! Big titted crazy witch! "Failure Disposal Room" Oh, Mistress Nero! Don't say "oh"! You cripples await incineration! From now, you who await incineration will kill eaeh other! The winner to be tasked with the honor of killing that crazy whore Giko! Got it? You pussy with the cock-drill! Yes...yes. Get your asses in gear. "In gear"... Well, here we are. Wait! It's me! Ms. Senzaki. It's you, GIKO. What's the meaning of this? Vulgar mutant cyborgs have attacked us. It was self-defense. You tried to run me over. You come and go here. That's why they attack us. Well, what do you want? Nero? Your classmate? Nero? Your classmate? Yes. You deserve it. The payback of bullled kids is always severe. I didn't bully her. Although I cut school, I knew she was bullied. I don't know much about her. Until a half year ago, she was a quiet girl. That, I know. What a barf out. Gross. What is this? You! Go fetch it! I want you to fetch it. What? Come on. Move your ass already. Go get it now! We found you a shortcut. We found you a shortcut. Careful not to fall. It's not high enough te die. Who cares if she dies? - Jump now! - Grab her legs! What the fuck? Look! She wet herself! Skeevy! You should push me off now. Soon my payback against you will be set in motion. That means? - You see her mug? - Real creepy like. - What happened to her? - What a laugh riot. Nobody in the class knew, but making mutant cyborgs was her thing. It's coming back to me. But I still don't know why she's after me. Giko! Quiet. Sorry to intrude. And who might you be? Sorry to be tardy. I'am freshman, Class B, Clear Death File. What business do you have here? I have come to kill, but who, I do not know. The thing is, Mistress Nero resents... You, Ms. Giko Nokomura. Well... Ow! The one you want is there! - I know. - Okay then! I'm going to dice you up as well! Hey. Eat it! Something wrong? Come on! It's not an easy fix. Crap. Eat it! Have more! Feast on these! There you are! Let me go! Ouch! Take that, asswipe! It's fixed, Giko. yaa Take revenge for my friend! Come on, get up. Let's end this. What the hell? I fixed your saw and lost 200 grams! That's just a cup of water! Idiot! In my profession it takes great effort to shed 200 grams! Maybe then you could fix it faster! Shut up! This is it so stay focused! What's the plan, Giko? Her weakness. Then go get her now. Don't know it yet, but she’s got one, What? She's made by someone who was a normal student. She can't be perfect. You may be right... Hey, freshman! You actually trust Nero to control you? That means? Not sure what she did, but one mistake and youd have died. You might be right... Where's she operate anyway? In the science lab? Doesn't sound very hygienic to me! Huh? What was that? What did you do? Us? Not a thing. The operation must've been a failure. Can't be... Again? Why? Wait, what's happening? How embarrassing! Why cover your eyes? You doubted me. You doubted me. Hey, tramp. Did you doubt me? I don't know. Do you know what I did to you? You made me invisible. In addition, I made it so that if for a single moment you doubt me, your body will revert itself to visibility! But it was just for a second. You deserve to be sliced up! I see. I've almost no memory of Nero other than her sulking in the classroom corner. So? I believe she doesn't come to trust anyone easily. She takes precautions in case she's betrayed. Get dressed. I don't fight naked people. I have no clothes. Give her yours. Huh? Why mine? Why do I have to... My clothes are in here. Uh, these clothes... They're really yours? In any case, you're clothed. Now, you must pay for what you did. What? You were too stupid to change even oil but I liked you. Was this my fault? Because I came here. It's not your fault. It's ‘cause I'm weak. Anyway, the horse power has been increased. It's got a motorcycle engine now. By the sound of it, it's a Kawasaki. You know! Air-cooled, four-cylinder engine. Cool. Wakita chainsaws are built solid and tune up easily. Let's see. I changed it here. No, inside. - See the red button? - This, here? - Don't push it now. - Why? - Just done. - Why? - Enjoy it later. - How come? - No - Tell me! Come on, glasses girl! Are there any survivors? For real? Ten out of ten out of commission? Ah, Mistress Nero... I have survived. Didn't expect this. Yes. As a reward, you'll get a drill on the other hand too. Thank you... One more thing, lie to me and you're dead. I Suppose you were cowering in the corner until the fight ended. I was. After you get the other drill hand, go kill Giko. You don't have to follow me. Follow you? I'm here to get revenge for my friend. “Die” "Mod Maniac” "Rock Freak” No leads in here. What is it, Giko? Remember her entry in the school fair? - School fair? - Yeah. “Uguisu School Fair" She didn't join the class maid cafe. Instead, she used a free classroom. She looked so utterly lonely. I've no pity for her. I, too, fit nowhere in the fair. Get in the operating room now! Mind your status. - I'll save her. - She's a cyborg. I know. Come on! I'd joined the boxing club, but now I'm back in the rugby club. Bloody hell! I really want to give her a kiss! You okay? Ask her where Nero is. A pawn like her knows squat. Right. Hey! Do you know? Why did you rescue me? That drill, it's by Wakita. I'm Wakita too. Only that? It'd be cooler if you changed that to a drill press, I think. Changing it into a jacknammer would be the coolest. See? She can tell a press drill from a jackhammer. It was a good decision to help her. It was. Hey, what's wrong? Hey, what's wrong? Hey, what's wrong? I've always wanted to talk about drills. "School Kitchen” "School Kitchen” You escaped to avoid another operation. At first she spoke to me kindly. Talking to me who only has drills for friends. However, after the operations she treated me like a thing. For real? Ten out of ten out of commission? We were all her classmates. But she called us Thing 1 and Thing 2. She's in here. An underground facility? Did she make this? Yes, it was her doing. Who the hell is she? Her room is just ahead Who goes there? You should know, idiot! I'd much to ask, but who cares? I've been attacked over and over. I just want you dead! Stand back. You really want to one-on-one with me? That's what I call cute. By the sound, it's some knockoff brand. Were you a Wakita user, it'd hurt to kill you. What? Things are getting interesting! You go against chainsaw philosophy! Bitch, you're wearing it now. What? It's no use apologizing to me! That's her mean face! Apologize? What did I do? Fine! Allow me to bring the memory back! You eat too much. It's so good. Hey, cleaning girl. Throw this out. Eat it up! Someone's dirty. I'm famished! A common, bullied girl A common, bullied girl. Thats what you think I am. But I didn't care how badly I was treated. Because I had music. Listen up! It's Maximum the Hormone. It's the sonic boom of my favorite band. What? Maximum the Hormone. Pardon? It's Maximum the Hormone. Wouldn't know. You're wearing their t-shirt! Huh? Wow, we're twins! See? Never listened to them. See, that's the issue! Hey, you, Nokomura! It's against school rules. What is? You don't know why? Much too short. If you want to go to school, wear this. Pain in the butt. What a creepy t-shirt. It was a gift. The band worked at our wrecking yard. It's against the rules too? I didn't say to take it off! That'd be sexual harassment! You're pissed ‘cause I roughed up your favorite band's shirt? You'll kill me for that? Fat chance. They were the worst workers I ever saw and I hated every last one of them. Especially the vocalist, Kawakita. How dare you say his real name! I called him Kawaki-poh. Shut up! It's my band and not one that ignorant sluts can understand! They sing for me alone! Have you met them? I'm their number one fan and number one follower! Who cares that you gave them work? You jealous or something? Is this why you turned 2/3s of the students into mutant cyborgs? Never bothered to count. Dumbass... A precious treasure all one’s own that nobody knows about. You wouldn't understand. Just a lonely girl. Hey, wait! She's running off. Press the blue button! Just do it! Holy mother. Okay, now how do I fight? Okay, now how do I fight? So wet All the teeth are gone! What do I do? Look out! Don't you got a spare? There's a plan B, but it needs electricity. What? In the schoolyard? I'll kill you... What are you doing? Give her... Giko! The socket's on the back. What'll you do now? Press red and wait 3 seconds! I'll kill you in two point five seconds! We did it! I call it the Piercing Chainsaw. By the way, I was given a Maximum the Hormone CD and listened to it once. Now it's too late. Our time has gone For all... Then what? For all our malice to dispense Living is a pain It's my most favorite song. Maybe yours too. We didn't have to be friends. But there's no need to kill each other. Can we go to the hardware store together? - Yeah, sure. - Okay. Not so fast! What now? Head of the Student Council Guardians, I'm Nemesis. Nemesis? I saw all. Killing students is against school rules. Now. Hey, let me go! What's your problem? You will be tossed into the school council prison. “Uguisu School Jukai Forest School Council Prison" Nana Asakawa Ano Nanami Hidaka Momoko Kaechi Asana Mamoru Edited, Directed by Hiroki Yamaguchi
