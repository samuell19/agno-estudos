You better bundle up. It is not good that you are wet. Maybe it's not too late. I need your help immediately. Come home with me. To your home? They don't listen to what I tell them. I ask you, please. If you are asking me for something, it would be polite to give me your name. Your name… I am Morikazu, son of Shigetake Nagaoka, leader of the hatamotos in the service of the shogun. Excuse me! Morikazu, son of Shigetake Nagaoka… NEMURI KYOSHIRO NAGAOKA Shizu… you… Please forgive me. Darn! Forgive me… I will not forgive you. Show me! Show me! Please stop. Forgive me! Do not say anything! Is it here? Is this what attracted Lord Nishinomaru? Come on! Tell me! How did Lord Nishinomaru caress you? Tell me! Speak! Tell me! Punish me… Punish me… Are you asking me to kill you? All right! All right, Shizu! It wasn't my business. Forgive me. Morikazu. Tell me your name… Remember me, I am Kyoshiro Nemuri. If you want to avenge your father's death, you can bring any help you want. Mother! Mother, please, stop! Morikazu, let me die… Wait! Take my mother! Morikazu… I don't want my mother to die. Please take her away! Oh! Was it you, Lord Nemuri? Don't scare me… I was looking for you. What I did is wrong, isn't it? I will return it. Come on, come on… It's messy, but you can come in. Come in. This morning I brought the tea. I thought that suddenly we'd see each other today… Help yourself. I have a petition. You finally say it… and what is it? I want you to stay with this person. I understand! I once had a beautiful woman in my custody, so I'm not going to hand her over to anyone. Also, she is very beautiful. Where is she from? She is the wife of a hatamoto in the service of the shogun. I killed the husband last night. Huh? Oh! Lord! What is it? Uhm…excuse me. While I was shopping the lady ran away. She ran away? Morikazu… please… forgive your mother. I can't let you die. Your son entrusted me with your life. If you still want to die, do it after I die. Hey! Hey! Wait a moment! Don't rush! Hey! Hey! Listen! Wait a moment! Hey! If you die, my honor will be ruined. Wait! Hey! Listen! Hey! Wait! Hey! It seems that the pieces are aligned. Undercover samurai? Are they here for me? Or are they here for this woman? Lord! Are you alright? Lord! Stay strong! Lord! Are you okay? Okay, come on… Monk! Hey, monk! Damn! What the hell is he doing? Monk! Who is it? Lord Nemuri is in trouble! Open up please! Hey… Here. Quick, come in. Lord! Rest, please? Thank you. How are you doing? How do you feel? Do your wounds hurt? I don't understand. You betrayed your husband, and you fell into the arms of the young Nishinomaru. I don't understand. What are you saying? I did not betray my husband. I was humiliated. Humiliated? Were you really… humiliated? It happened a month ago. I was invited to a Nishinomaru banquet. Right at the height of the party, an attendant called me and I went up to the young man's room. Your husband is also aware of this. Lord Nemuri… please understand what is inside my heart. Thanks to you, everything was easier for me. What a relief that the fever has subsided… You didn't sleep at all last night. You should go rest in another room. Don't worry. It shouldn't be like that. I am grateful to you for saving my life. I am here for you. I know I can't be of much use to you. Lord. I brought Shinken Ashita. Good. Oh, I've been waiting for you. What is it? I only ask you one thing. I want you to kill a person. Whom? One named Kyoshi Nemuri. I sent quite a few men, but they were all defeated. Do you know him? Nemuri Kyoshiro. Do you think you can win? I can't answer until I know him. No one has been able to overcome yet Kiyoshiro's Full Moon Killing Technique. However, he must be killed no matter what. I would like you to explain to me why I should kill him. I won't give you an explanation. Lord! Isn't it too early to go for a walk? Don't you know that your wounds will hurt? Are you okay? Even if it's just for today, you shouldn't fight with your sword. You have no chance of winning. Are you listening to me? Huh? So, let's go to the usual place. Oh… Today you have a very serious face again. What is happening? The young Nishinomaru… he abused the wife of the leader Nagaoka. Did you know? As expected, you learn things quickly. The young Nishinomaru will become the next shogun. I never thought such a person would abuse a vassal's wife. How the hell can that happen? No, that I don't understand. You don't understand? It can't stay like this anymore. Well, don't be so upset… I don't understand what is happening. About the young lord… we are both really confused. About half a year ago… the young lord changed a lot. He changed? Though it's hard to say, the young lord has lost his mind. He gets drunk day after day. It didn't just happen with Nagaoka's wife. He kept calling the daughters and wives of his vassals. Just for fun. Why did that brilliant young man… has gone crazy? It is a mystery that remains unsolved. You do everything you can, but it is difficult to deal with such a disgusting person. Disgusting? There is someone who benefits from all this. He is close to the young lord. In the past half year, he has relieved seven people of their posts. He is younger than me and has been promoted very quickly. What is his name? Kagefusa Higonokami Sano. He cleverly covered up the young lord's misbehavior. He's trying to keep it out of the public eye. So, have the women who were abused resigned themselves to Higonokami's power? Yes. Why has the young lord gone mad? Maybe behind all this, there is hidden Higonokami's terrifying plan. A plan? He is a man who will do anything to get ahead. It doesn't matter if she is someone's wife or someone else, he will take their life if that prevents them from speaking. Old man, the enemy is already moving. Kyoshiro! I will take care of the mystery about the madness of the young lord. My name is Shinken Ashita. Higonokami Sano sent you? Higonokami entrusted me with a duty that I cannot refuse, but if I defeat you while you are still wounded, I will regret it. It seems that our duel will be another day. You don't have to be so understanding. No. You are a unique rival in my life. I will wait ten days. I can not accept it. I, Kyoshiro Nemuri, am a man who only thinks about today and not about tomorrow. I would like to see the full moon killing technique again in the future. He is late… What will he be doing? Lord! Huh? What is this? Please… Yes. Bring me water. Yes. Didn't I tell you? To not do it today… Call Fumiya. Fumiya? Again… This is not the time to see a woman… Bring her. Uh… What's going on? Sir, excuse me. May I borrow Fumiya for a moment? What is happening? Lord Nemuri. You are horrible. If you wanted to ask me for something, you should have told me from the beginning. Right? Is it not like this? You are always avoiding me. What will you do with this body? Stop. My Lord? We already know each other and you're still not relaxed with me. Lord? KYOSHIRO I owe you my life, Lord. I don't care how you use me. The way things are, I feel sad. So… Please promise me. If I return safely from the castle, you will hug me. I won't ask for anything else. Wait! I know I can't deal with you. Okay, let me do it. NISHINOMARU EDO CASTLE Come on. Lord. What are you waiting for? Hurry up! Yes, sir. Hurry up. Everyone, go downstairs. Wait! Lord… Go downstairs! Oh… Kyoshiro did that? What can be done! He recruited an unknown woman, and sent her to Nishinomaru's quarters. A difficult task for her. However, this is a very important thing for everyone. I hope you can uncover the mystery of the young lord's madness. Ah, you're doing it very diligently. It is already recovering its shine day by day. Excellent. By the way, what about Lord Kyoshiro? He just left. Oh, I understand. Today is the anniversary of the death of his mother. Anniversary of his mother's death? He probably went to visit her grave. Have you known him long? Yes… Around four or five years. While he was saving my life, I thought I didn't even know what kind of person he was. If you don't mind, could you tell me a bit? He himself never tells the details. But he was born under an unfortunate star. No doubt about that. Unfortunate? Since I can remember, he hasn't made a single friend. He was only with his mother living in some remote temple. He had a very lonely life. That's how it was. That's more or less what I know. When he was 12 years old, his mother died. He transported his mother's body by himself to the mansion of their ancestors. He dug the hole and buried her. That made him decide to live alone all his life. That's what I know. I see. Losing his mother at the age of 12… Mother. I still haven't forgotten you. That's why I come here to visit you. I am very grateful to you. Could it be? Oh… as expected. And who are you? Even if I told you, you wouldn't know who I am. I'm a person who used to work for your mother, until she stopped living in Azabu's mansion. So, have you left these flowers? That's right. I see. My mother must be very happy. I see in your face that you still ache for your mother. It's so nostalgic. My heart no longer… My house is near here. Please rest before you return home. SHIGETAKE NAGAOKA'S SOUL Oh… You came to visit… Monk, are you praying for his soul? You noticed? The truth is… Lord Kyoshiro entrusted me that. I pray for his soul in the mornings and in the afternoons. Lord Nemuri? Until now, Lord Kyoshiro has sent endless lives to the afterlife. All the souls that are here are from those people. Only very few people… know how to love someone from the bottom of their heart. To love is to know the faults and defects of the other. He is that kind of person. Could it be possible that… It's so sudden that I can't offer you any kind of hospitality. She is my niece. Pour Lord Kyoshiro something to drink. What kind of behavior is that? Well done, you investigated the anniversary of my mother's death. As expected, Higonokami Sano is very smart. I would let you go like this, but desecrating my mother's grave is unforgivable. He said you were his niece, but you're his daughter, right? If I killed you now, who will watch over your mother's soul next year? What happened? They failed? That's not all. Nemuri Kyoshiro already knows that you sent ninjas to kill him. Enough of this nonsense! That man… he's not just any ronin. What do you mean? He is close to Senjuro Takebe, server of the bugyo. Close to Senjuro… We must be careful with our movements. And our man? No information yet. For now, you have to be careful. Can't you trust anyone? What is Shinken Ashita doing? Well… Do we distrust Shinken? Excuse me. What is it? Right now, Nagaoka's son is here accompanied by his uncle, Sakon Tabuchi. Let them come in. Yes. This is my nephew Morikazu. You seem to be a pretty smart boy. What happened to your father was very painful, wasn't it? Yes. By the way, Sacon. Yes. Regarding the future of the Nagaoka family, I have not received an answer from above. I understand. However, they will get help. We will get revenge. When we cut off Kyoshiro Nemuri's head, I, Higonokami, will take care of the Nagaoka family. Revenge… If I take revenge, will my mother be able to return to the Nagaoka house? Are you worried about your mother? Yes. I understand. I'll think about that. However, revenge is prohibited in this country. Sakon, don't you accept the kindness of the lord? Yes. You feel lonely, don't you? I'm tired of drinking and women. I want to go home. What are you saying? In me you have a place to return to. Shall we run away? Together… Run away where? Go back home. To the countryside… The countryside? You want to return to the countryside? It's a good place. Tsugaru. Tsugaru? Lord Kyoshiro. Do you mind if I bother you? Come in. It's embarrassing because it's just an imitation. I made it. Please accept it. Where did you get that fabric? I asked the monk to do me the favor of buying it. When I was a child I learned to sew from my mother. I hadn't had a chance to sew. Please don't laugh at me. Lord Kyoshiro? I can not accept it. Why? Please tell me. I don't want to deepen my relationship with you any further. Relationship? It's just because of that. No, I do not understand. I do not understand. If you don't want any kind of relationship, why didn't you let me die? Mrs. Shizu. Until now, many women who have been associated with me have ended up losing their lives. I don't want it to happen again. It is also for your son. What's going on? Monk… He didn't accept it, did he? Please tell me. Shouldn't I love anyone? Why can't I love someone and give my heart strength to continue living? I have not forgotten that I am a mother. But… the more and more I hold back… the more I look for him. Am I a bad woman? Even if you are a mother… You don't stop being a woman, that doesn't change. All these hardships, they are just a preparation. Can you free me from all this? No, a monk cannot do that. You must follow your heart until you are satisfied. I have almost nothing… Hey! Hey! I already came here! Here I have them… Here I have them. Oh! You look refreshed! Yeah! Everything is new, the illustrated books are too! Come on, grab it and take a look at it. This! This! What do you think of this one? Come on. If you like it, buy it, please. What do you think? Do you like it? Another time. I understand. Oh, please show me that. You know? The printing of that one is not good. It is a defective product. I'm sorry. “Sir, don't be surprised by what I will tell you. The young lord is not the real Lord Ieyoshi. Six months ago, Lord Ieyoshi went on a trip. He met with the shogun and… upon returning to Edo castle it was as if he had completely changed. In other words, the real lord Ieyoshi disappeared somewhere. The one who returned to Edo is not the real one. It seems something happened on that trip.” I can't believe it. He's not the real one… But, if they have replaced the real one, it would make sense… Although, there is no other person in this world that is exactly the same as the young lord. Yes. Now that you mention it, that's true. Things won't progress if we just talk. Kyoshiro! I trust Fumiya. The real lord Ieyoshi left for Kyoto. The first thing to do is find out if he is safe. Understood. We will do as you say. This is our priority. Can you go to Kyoto, Lord Kyoshiro? You can't live in a world where you don't know what's going on. Draw your sword again. Just… Just for this case… A ten-year-old boy suffers because he lost his father and separated from his mother. I want you both to keep this in your heart. Do not come in. I will be leaving for Kyoto soon. Huh? I'll tell the monk to take care of you. It goes without saying that there is constant danger for you. Never leave the temple. Lord Kyoshiro. Please. Please keep me by your side. I will not be a hindrance. You saved me not once, but twice. I have just begun to understand how to live. If you leave me, I will lose the will to live. Just by being by your side… just by being by your side… I will be happy. Mrs. Shizu… Please let me. Please… I love you… No, it can not be. No! I am prepared for everything that happens. Would you still be with me even if we fell to hell? Yes. Are you okay, sir? Leaving Mrs. Shizu… Be very careful on the way. Shinken? Yes. Why didn't you kill Kyoshiro? You have no samurai pride. You are just a murderer who kills people. You kill even if you don't feel like it. If you don't, your life is meaningless. I find it pathetic not to be useful. I didn't say I wouldn't kill him. Then, I let you know the following, Nemuri Kyoshiro has gone to Kyoto. He's stupid. He just bothers me. Lord! It's my first time in Kyoto. When we get there, there's a place I want to see first. Do you know what it is? You don't know, do you? It's Shimabara. I want to spend the night with a prostitute from there. It seems a little strange to me what you wish for. Huh? Mrs. Shizu. Mrs. Shizu. "Thank you for your help. I'll follow Lord Kyoshiro. Shizu.” KAWADOME Sir, it won't be long… Two or three days more. These guys are not good. Everyone has a ninja face. Are you tired? Yes. Our next stop will be at Kawadome. If we hurry two or three days, we will surely meet Kyoshiro Nemuri. Yes. Hey. Go take a bath. It will relax you. Yes. Huh? I can't hear the rain. Oh! It has stopped, right? The bill, sir! Yeah! It's 45 mons. Oh! It's very cheap! Thank you. What's going on? I'm burning! What happened? It hurts! Calm down! Who is it? Oh, it's you. Kyoshiro Nemuri is at an inn in Shimada. He should take at least five or six days. Please hurry up. Are you sure? Don't let Kyoshiro go to Kyoto before me. Understood? Yes. Then go. How are you? Do your feet hurt? Yes. The ship will leave! Lord… I'm ashamed. Uncle. Huh? I want to change my sandals. I see. So, let's take a break. - Lord. - Yes. - Tea and rice. Yes. Does it hurt? No, I'm fine. Use this. That will make it more comfortable. I'm thankful. Morikazu, accept it. Thank you so much. How far are you going? Well, it's an aimless journey. I feel bad for forcing the child to do this. Lord… I have a petition. One moment… I offer myself to you. I need money. Please. Please embrace me. My daughter has a fever. The doctor is examining her. I really need the money. Please embrace me. Do you want to keep fighting? Go ahead! Don't waste the life your parents gave you. How do you feel? You look better. Fine. I'm in a hurry, so I'll say goodbye here. Be careful on the way. You don't look lively. What happened? I don't want to travel anymore! Why do you say that? Aren't you with your uncle? Is there something you don't like? My son is the same age as you. If you want, you can talk to me. I must take revenge. Revenge? Who's your opponent? Kyoshiro Nemuri. He is not a bad person. But if I don't go, I won't get my home back. Your home? Do you think that is so important? Even if two people were to fight against him, they would not be at his level. It makes no sense to lose your life to protect your home. Aren't you afraid of dying? Forget revenge. I will kill Kyoshiro Nemuri. I will do it for you. That's okay. Forget revenge. Take care of yourself. Ronin! Good. How are you? Oh… well. Alright. Sorry for taking so long. So can we leave tomorrow? Yes. Excuse me. A samurai named Shinken Ashita asked me to deliver this. Shinken Ashita. Huh? Look… Sir, what's going on? It's a challenge letter. Hey! Uh… Well, that person does not stay here… - Hiko? - That's right… A ronin, right? I do not know him. Oh! If you ask about those two, they were drinking here. When did that happen? I think about seven days ago. But, it was right around here where he seriously injured himself. Huh? Maybe they're still here. Yesterday I think I saw the ronin around… Do you know where they are staying? Yes. I saw them outside the inn. Uh… it's all the way there. Thank you so much. I want to end this today. You have no objection, do you? Before we fight, let me ask you something. Why do you work for Higonokami? Forget that. This result is a matter of fate. No matter who wins, one day we'll both walk the path of the dead. Of the dead? Do you have someone waiting for you at home? Is it so? A 12-year-old son who is with the Ogaki clan. Ogaki clan? With Higonokami? That's right. Because he has a stupid father, he is now a hostage. You! Can't you even do this? Idiot! It was when my son was five years old. - Lord Yamada… - Shut up! I got angry because of my boss's irrational behavior. I killed him after an argument in the castle. - What are you doing? - Stop! My wife committed suicide and I sought to flee from death. - Leave me! - You're crazy! At that time, I begged Higonokami to spare our lives. I asked him to save my son's life. Lord Higonokami. Please spare the life… of Tatsunoshin. I beg you. My son's life is at stake. On the way, I met a boy who pointed you out as his enemy. Also for his sake, I will defeat you. Well… it can't be helped. Then let's fight. Don't worry about your son. Let me do what I can. Lord Kyoshiro. Damn! I wonder where he went. I don't think they killed him… Tea for the shogun! Here comes the tea! Tea for the shogun! Wait… excuse me! What is it? Just tea for the shogun. They are only going to Kyoto to buy tea for the shogun. So much noise. They can hear you. But it is true! Right? Every year they buy tea. And you even line up to see this. So much for the shogun. You should stop. Be quiet! - Hey. - What is it? Oh, sir! That? Lady Shizu! Where did you meet, sir? That's good, isn't it? In general, I was against leaving Mrs. Shizu behind. Wait! Sir, sir, sir… One moment. Something amazing happened. What happened? Fumiya was in the tea caravan? Yes. I saw him with my own eyes. Lord. How did you know I was here? I heard it around. Also that you were staying in this place. You heard it around? Higonokami Sano has come… here. As I thought. That young man is actually Lord Ieyoshi's younger brother. His younger brother? They were born as twins at Nijo Castle in Kyoto. However, the twins were separated. They took one to Tsugaru with a surrogate mother. In secret. But, why did Higonokami know that secret? From the surrogate mother. Her name is Sugiju. It seems that she's still in Kyoto's Nijo Castle and wields power. So is the real Ieyoshi still alive? I think so, but I'm not sure. Although, if Higonokami has done all this in secret, it's because he's up to something. Fumiya, you have researched very well. I appreciate it. Fumi! Fumi! Lord… Hug me… Hold on… I'm happy. Dying in the arms of my lord… I'm happy… Tell Kyoshiro Nemuri, if he wants her back, to come find us. What happened to Fumi? Hurry up and bring her to me. Calm down. They will be waiting for you when you arrive to Kyoto. Calm down a bit. Stop joking! I'm tired of being a caged bird! I will give my brother his life back! Sir, you're talking too loud. Oh, aren't you Shizu? What a weird place to meet, isn't it? Come on, come here. Shizu! Who are you? Bow! Not before an impostor. What? Higonokami Sano? That's right. I didn't think that you… would come only for a woman. Unexpectedly, you are a fool. Fools are those who have a foolish way of life. I don't understand how you can shed blood to take over the world. That way of life is very good. Do not move! Leave this to us! Thank you so much. From the old man Takebe. “Kyoshiro, are you safe? I was worried, so I decided to send help. I've known them for a long time. They are three Iga ninjas, Nekobei, Saruta and Inusuke. Lean on them however you want. I send money in case you need it. To Kyoshiro Nemuri. From Senjuro”. That was it? Thanks again. Truly, thank you very much for helping me when I was in danger. It was nothing. I know it's a bit rushed but I would like to leave at dawn. Can you prepare a boat for me? Understood. We must go to Kyoto as soon as possible and rescue a person. Yes. Well, then I'll go rest somewhere. Well… Go ahead and get mad at me. I didn't want to cause trouble. From the bottom of my heart, I just want to be with you, that's why I left Edo. Today… I have realized that I am being selfish. I am sorry. Mrs. Shizu. Someone has seen your son on the road. Morikazu? They must probably be near here. But why is Morikazu here? He is here to kill me to avenge his father's death. Revenge? You, Lord Kyoshiro? Isn't it also a way of life to try to get back together with his mother? Lord Kyoshiro… Here we part. Look up! Don't tell me you didn't know! It doesn't matter that… you're only carrying one, it's forbidden to take it to other territories. - Hey! - Yes! - Take it. - Yes. Don't you think that woman is strange? It is suspicious she approached Lord Kyoshiro. - Keep your eyes open. - Yes. Mr. Samurai! Mr. Samurai, I'm sorry about what happened earlier. Desperately, I ended up giving it to you. You saved me. Thank you so much. Are you sneaking it out and selling it? Yes. Today has not been a good day, so I only have this option. But if I sell this, it'll be enough for dinner. What happened to your sister and brother? They returned home. Well, please get on my horse. I won't ask you for money. No, I will simply accept your intention. But… you look very tired. Tired? Do you notice that? Mr. Samurai, don't push yourself too hard and get on the horse. I'll take you to your destination. My destination is Kyoto. Huh? Kyoto? I can take you to the Suzuka Pass. Come on, get on. Is it okay for me to ride the horse? A single woman could do nothing. Sorry for the bother. I don't need your money. I'll come for you again tomorrow. There's no need. No. As promised, I'll take you to the Suzuka pass. Thank you so much. How was it? They were staying at a hot spring inn. To relieve fatigue. Are you sure it was Morikazu? Yes. He is with his uncle, Lord Sakon Tabuchi. Huh? With Sakon? The revenge thing is real after all. What do we do? It's cold. Are you not cold? I'm a bit feverish. I want to sleep, so I won't eat. Understood. And that woman? Nothing. She went home. Is she a ninja? That kindness… Maybe she is waiting to cut the throat, kill and burn the body. On the other hand, maybe I can sleep peacefully to catch my breath. This won't let me sleep. Good morning. Did you sleep well? Yes. Go ahead. Mr. Samurai, you still don't look good. Do you feel sick? Does it seem like it? I know a good medicine for all kinds of diseases. If you take it, you will recover. Then, let's go. If we go a little further, there is a sanctuary. There is a rice there that is good for all diseases. Rice? My family has belonged to the Koga ninja for generations. That medicine is from them. What about your parents? I don't know. They left home once and never came back. Maybe they were killed. Taking care of many children is very complicated. Look, we have arrived. Look, this is it. Mr. Samurai, four or five grains is enough. Eat them. I'm sure it will work. Go ahead. Lord Kyoshiro Nemuri! That's dangerous. This rice is poisonous. And who are you? By order of Senjuro Takebe I am following you. I am Sagenta Tokumori of the Mizuno family. What are you doing? What you say is true? Or is this girl's kindness sincere? I wanted to check it out. The one who disturbed my sleep last night… was you. What are you saying? You killed an innocent girl, just to pass off as an ally of mine. Unforgivable. The kindness of this girl… I want to thank her even a little. Take the body along with condolences. Tell her sisters and brothers. Yes. Ah, I'll look there too. Good. Shizu! Please. Please let me see Morikazu. Tell me honestly… why are you here? Are you with Kyoshiro Nemuri? Where is he? Lord Nemuri left in a hurry for Kyoto. Did you say "Lord Nemuri"? Why do you call him that? You are in love, aren't you? How dare you say you want to see Morikazu? Don't you think you'll embarrass him? It does not matter what you say. I swear right now I'm just trying to live honestly with my feelings. I know this is selfish. But let me see Morikazu… No. I can't let you see him! That is something I will never allow. Uncle! Uncle! Morikazu. Leave! Otherwise… I will kill you. KYOTO Nekobei. Tell me. Can you infiltrate Nijo Castle? Yes, what do you need? There is a person named Sugiju. She should probably be at the bottom of the castle. Shall I bring her? Yes. NIJO CASTLE Do not speak. You brutes! Who are you? If you confess honestly, I'll spare your life! Where is the real lord Ieyoshi? Is he alright? Yes. Where do you have him? I don't know. You're lying! I really don't know. Lord Higonokami Sano has him somewhere. That Higonokami… why is he coming to Kyoto? Won't you talk? Rumors began to spread in the castle that the young lord is not the real one. I heard it's to have an audience and get the approval as future shogun for the fake Ieyoshi. As soon as that ceremony ends, he plans to take Lord Ieyasu's life, right? It's true, isn't it? Yes. Why did you tell Higonokami that Lord Ieyoshi had a younger brother? Speak! Lord Higonokami is a person who has the strength and ambition to rule. However, Lord Ieyoshi, who will become the next shogun, for some reason he rejects me. And in recent years, his progress has stalled. He was in the depths of despair. In his state of suffering, I was very disappointed. So last year, the secret about Lord Ieyoshi, which I have kept in my heart for more than 30 years… I ended up telling Lord Higonokami. So, it occurred to him to replace him with his younger brother. Yes. I received orders. I took Tsugaru's younger brother to Kyoto. It took him about three months to learn about the etiquette and customs of the castle. I also taught him how to become a shogun. One day Higonokami will make the younger of the brothers shogun, he will take the position of adviser to the shogun and will rule this world. Please… Please… don't divulge all this… What are you going to do? Take her back. We must rescue young Ieyoshi at all costs. I will find out where they have him. Oh, Sugiju? Welcome back. What's going on? Aren't you feeling well? No. You betrayed us. Who is it? Can you get rid of him first? All the care we have costs a lot of money. It was a lot of work, but you must wait one more day. The lord also made a decision. We will finish it tomorrow. When the time comes, I'll leave it to you. Hey, Higonokami. Do you really have to go to the imperial palace? It is a necessary ceremony for this farce to become real. If we receive approval, no matter who you are, you will become the real Ieyoshi. I'm tired of all this. I'm returning to Tsugaru. What? Enough of this game already! Let my brother visit the imperial palace. You're alive, aren't you? You think you can return to Tsugaru like nothing happened? If you try to back out now, I won't forgive you! Sir, we are on your side. Come on. Come on. It's almost time to go. Oh! Everything is perfect. It's what you've always wanted, isn't it? Also, you guys are identical. Are you okay? Once this is over, you will be the real Ieyoshi. What is it? Are you not happy? With this, the whole world will be mine. Idiot! Look at me well. I am Ieyoshi! Do you want to stop? You are joking around a lot! A joke would be rude. So… it's you! I will not forgive you! Blinded by greed, you can't seem to see reality. What are you saying? You act only out of greed, craving control of the world with this charade. Allow me to draw the curtain on this play. Higonokami… you stop this right now. I have no resentment towards Toshijiro, my younger brother. He was fooled by your sweet words. You broke the laws of the world for your ambitions. As brothers of the same blood, if there is something we can save, I want to save it no matter what. Maybe he doesn't understand my pain for our separation! Brother. Toshijiro… It seems that this was inevitable. I will finish all of you! Come! Come! Bastard! Brother! Toshijiro! Attack! Lord! What's going on? The thing is… Has Morikazu come to Kyoto? Yes. Nekobei and the others are looking for him now. And Mrs. Shizu? Is Morikazu in Kyoto? Yes. He came after all. Morikazu really wants revenge. Lord Kyoshiro… Please… Please don't meet Morikazu. Lord Kyoshiro. We found the boy. Huh? Looks like he's waiting at the Gumyoji temple near here. Sir, I don't think this is right. To see my lord kill a child… Mrs. Shizu. I will go now. Morikazu. Take my mother! You will defeat me. I don't care, so you can take revenge. For a long time… I've been a man who only thinks about today and not about tomorrow. I will gladly be defeated by you. I have only one request… your mother will not be able to return to the Nagaoka house, so she won't be able to live with you. So I would like to ask you something… after you defeat me, leave the path of a samurai. I want parents and children to live together. Since childhood, I had no one to call “mother”. But you have an irreplaceable one. Hold on tight to this happiness. Live with your mother. Come on… kill me. Mother! Morikazu!
