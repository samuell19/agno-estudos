[music] Subtitles by explosiveskull [wind blowing] [electronic buzz] [dramatic music] [exhaling] [woman on PA] Kelley? [man] We all know why we're here. Or do we? [electronic noise] [Goldstucker] If the CIA were a financial institution, our most valuable currency would be intelligence. Like any other currency, it has the power to enrich or to destroy lives. [siren wailing] [Goldstucker] The correct intelligence can prevent such conflict. Comprehending intelligence can save thousands of lives. Ignoring intelligence... [explosions] ...well, let's not even go there. [Goldstucker] With the rapid advancements of technology it has become well neigh impossible to secure critical intelligence from falling into the wrong hands. [gunshots] What is the optimal way to gather, transport, and secure high-risk intelligence. And what we discovered is that our greatest security, the safest of safes, is right here in the palms of my hands. [street noises] Intelligence secured. Over. [Goldstucker] Our operation isn't about inserting a microchip into your existing brain. That would be simply silly. This is about harnessing the power your brain was born with. From that traumatic first day, your brain has been harvesting raw data. Your sensories have been recording every sight, sound, smell, taste, touch. There's not a more powerful processor on this planet. Your brain processes an enormous amount of information. And it does so with ease. No computer hard drive could remotely replicate the memory, the storage, or the encryption of the human brain. [ominous music] Red. Zero. Three. Zero. Z. Eight. - [Peter] Alright, Kelley. - 22. [Peter] Perfect. Beach. - Plane. - [woman on PA] Preparing to unlock vault. [Peter] Download that right there. Whoa... I didn't need to see that. [Peter] Looks like he went to that bar. I recognize it. Come on, Kelley. I know you got it. Flip that. [Peter] That's what I'm talking about. Huh. Here we go... - [Peter] Hey, Kelley. - [Kelley] Yeah? [Peter] It's been a good day for the good guys. - Alert DHS. - Roger that. Any specifics? No. Just that it looks like the Golden Gate almost became Heaven's Gate for a whole bunch of Beatniks. I'm Ava Obada with our breaking news this hour. Uni... [electronic jamming] of defense are confirming moments ago that they intercepted vital intelligence linking an apparent terrorist plot to detonate explosives throughout the Golden... [electronic jamming] Explosives were located... [electronic jamming] ...here and here... [woman's voice on radio] - [Kelley] Let's play this guessing game. - [Tess] Okay. - I'm going to kiss you and you're going to guess. - Okay. [giggling] - I love you. - No, no, no. - That's not I? - No, I has like three beats. - Ready? - Is it L? Yeah. L. - Ready? - Uh-huh. [beeping] O. That's what? - A V? - A V. You ready for this? No? That's definitely an E. - Y? It's an O. - Okay. U. Oh. - What? - You love me. - I love you. - You love me the most. Love you the most. - That's long. - That's long. That's long Morse code. [Hotchkiss] Come over here and sit down with me. Our operatives mined some intelligence out of a sub network yesterday. It's a 23 month long conversation between a dozen high-ranking terrorists from Ah Puch. These green dots here, they indicate every time they are alluded to activities that contain weapons or explosives or any kind of materials that are related to both. They're planning one hell of a party. And we're gonna crash it. We're gonna shut them down. Unfortunately, our intelligence didn't include a "save the date" card. Exactly when and where we do not know, but what we do know is that there's information out there that will give us the intelligence needed to stop them. And I'm gonna send you - to go and get it. - Yes, sir. How the hell do you think you're going to get out of this alive with the intelligence intact? We do not have an embassy for a thousand miles here. We have no military support in the area. Sounds awfully dangerous, doesn't it, Scotty? Oh, yeah. Everything you do makes me wet. Like... the bed and... Scotty, would you mind, uh, starting on due diligence? - Prepare a list of operatives, safe houses. - Yes, sir. - I know you don't need me to say this... - Then don't. Well, I have to. This is a one-way ticket. These are my orders, Peter. [sighs] Kelley, as you know, my job is to not only assess the risk of the operation, but also the risk to our agents. [Peter] This is a suicide mission. You are not this good. This is a zero-sum game. [high pitched noise] Please, don't start to worry. Do me a favor. Do me a favor: Lie to me. Tell me that you're going to Fiji and I'll be okay. I'm going to Fiji. It doesn't work. It doesn't work. What happened when I went to Vietnam? You came home. - Okay. And what happened when I went to Darfur? - You came home. - And what happened when I went to... - Alright, I get it. I know. I really do. I just hate it when you go. I always come home. Can you be back by your birthday? - I promise. - Okay. You know? You're going to be okay. - I'll be fine. - You're going to be okay. I love you. I love you more. - How's Tess? - She's fine, thanks. Updating. Installing anti-viral vaccine. [groans] [Kelley] Argh! Argh! Relax. Just let the vaccine take hold. - Okay? - Yeah. You're good to go. Hey. [whistles] [Peter] Once you pass Al-Fashir [cross talk] you're in no-man's-land. - You listening? - Yeah. Oh, Scotty, you better hope I don't die. - Chuck? - I'm sorry, we're fresh out of biblical names. - Don't be afraid to use it. - That's funny. [Peter] Will you point that away from me, please. Here, take this. Put that in there. Er... Alright. Let's get this death march on the road. [Kelley] Listen, Khalid. We've known each other how many years? I come all the way up here. All I'm asking is just for the intelligence. Nothing more. [Kelley] But I am gonna tell you right now, this is intelligence. It's not about me. This isn't intelligence. It's about you. This is about these people here. Millions upon millions of people. [Kelley] I come up here to save these people. Not just my people. Your people. This is about everybody. Everybody. Come on. Thank you. Twelve countries... Son-of-a-bitch. [traffic sounds] [high pitched noise] [high pitched noise] Argh! [electronic noise] [man] Sensing the slightest compromise, the vault will automatically lock... [boom] [blasts] [blasts] [pants] [dialing tone] [phone rings] Connect me with the Central Intelligence Agency. [busy tone] Fuck! [coughs] [pants] I'm so happy you're home. - So happy you're home. - [knocking on the door] Ah. I can't sleep at all, while you're away. I've been trying to. - [knocking on door] - Tess? - [knocking on door] - Tess? No, no. No, [inaudible] [crying] [crying] [man] Are you the wife of Kelley Chandler? You're aware that he suffered a major head injury? We were able to relieve the pressure on his brain and stop the bleeding, although Kelley is in a coma. [hospital call on PA] [surgeon] We'll move him out of recovery into intensive care. You can visit him there. I need to caution you, though: Kelley is not responsive. So, uh, if you talk to him or hold his hand, any reaction on his part, will be involuntary. [crying] Kelley. - Tess. - Oh, Tess. Okay. Amelia, why don't you go grab your sister some water. Okay. I won't know much until a neurologist examines him tomorrow morning. [exhales] What? The neurologist isn't gonna tell us anything. Tess, you know we're doing everything in our power to find out what happened, right? You know what happened. [man] Welcome. Please state your name. [Tess] Tess Chandler. [man] The following evaluation will determine your level of emotional intelligence. [traffic noises] [muezzin calling to prayer] [birds flapping] [eerie music] [high pitched noise] [waves crashing] [electronic noise] [traffic noises] Unfortunately, you don't need to be a neurologist to see that the swelling and internal bleeding is quite severe. Do you think that he is brain-dead? Our neurology group is currently conducting a series of cranial nerve tests to see if his unresponsive state is permanent. So, at this moment I... I can't provide you a definitive diagnosis. Doctor, in, in your professional opinion, do you think that he's... Do you think he is brain-dead? Based on what we've seen thus far - most likely, yes. - [sobs] I'm sorry, Tess. [Tess sobs] Agent Hobbs, sir. Yeah? [electronic humming] Sir, unfortunately, we've been informed... The likelihood of Agent Chandler making a full recovery is slim. All signs point to the loss of brain function, sir. [smacks lips] Fuck. [whirring noise] Okay. We'll have to issue, uh an executive order to confiscate his intelligence. Sir, this is not confirmed. It's not 100%. We're still dealing with a living human being. No, we're dealing with millions of human lives, Peter. - Millions of human lives. - Right. Millions that are protected by the talents the likes of Agent Chandler... No. Let me explain something, Peter. His talent is no longer any use to us. Is it always what's useful, or what's right and wrong? Let me explain something to you, young Peter! The world is made up of two things: Black and white. And there ain't nothing in between. - With all due respect... - No! You have your order! Do as you're told! Yes, sir. [distorted voices] [whirring noise] [high pitched buzzing] [Scotty] Boss, we're pulling surveillance from all around the surrounding areas. And we're pulling his medical records, internal. - His expense reports, travel logs. Is there anything else? - Yeah. I'm gonna need you to issue the executive order to Tess. What? Why me? Oh, will you grow a pair? Just throw his pocket litter on top and you'll be fine. [automated voice] Hello. You have reached the Central Intelligence Agency. If you know the extension of your party, please enter now. Please leave a detailed message after the tone. [high pitched noise] The vault, it's fractured. Every move... it's somewhere different. Every time... [Kelley] Sometimes Marrakesh. Sometimes Hong Kong. I don't know where I'm at. Sometimes Vietnam... [high pitched noise] [gasping and coughing] - Here. - [exhales] Thank you. [crickets chirping outside] [sighs] Another nightmare? [Tess sighs and gulps] A nightmare that this was all a nightmare. [inhales deeply and exhales] Scotty is here. - I love you. - I love you, too. I wanted you to have Kelley's personal effects before they got lost in evidence. Thank you. There's also some, uh, documents you should take a look at. Tess, uh, no one could've stopped him. - What was his mission? - Uh, it... it's classified. - Scotty, what was his mission? - Tess, I, I can't... [echoed voice] even begin to start talking about that. We're off the deep end here, OK? It's more than losing my job, it's... it's way bigger than anything I've any comprehension of right now. I'm sorry. [sighs] If there's anything you need at all, just let me know. I know that Kelley would do anything for me, so... - Thanks, Scotty. Appreciate it. - Yeah. [tense music] [Douglas] They're actually just detailing rights that they have that they would like to exercise before Kelley's condition deteriorates. Rights to Kelley? They don't own Kelley. Uh, that's correct. They don't. But, apparently, they do own the intelligence in his head. And they would like that in their possession. For which they're willing to compensate you. Bottom line is they're trying to buy Kelley? - In ten thousand words, yes. - That's not gonna happen. Okay. I can delay with an injunction. But you have to understand something: No court of law can stop them, when it comes to national security, national security. So, with that in mind, I thought it might be prudent for me to go off and have a very quiet conversation with them about compensation. Let me be clear: There is no amount of hush money that is going to encourage me to sign over my husband. I've one piece of advice for you: - Take the payoff. Forget the payback. - No. No. [cacophony of sounds] [high pitched noise] [man speaking Spanish] - Where is this? - [man speaking Spanish] [man speaking Spanish] - [man speaking Spanish] - Where is this? You're not in the vault, the vault is in you. [cacophony of sounds] [Kelley groans] [alarms wail] I don't where the fuck they are. Clearly I'm gonna wait here. [Ah Puch] This is a very serious question I want you to really think about. [dramatic music] [soldier] Get out of the car! Get out of the car! Identify yourself. - I'm the wife of Kelley Chandler. - Stand down, soldier. Get back in the car. We're good here. Thank you. Please. After you. What the fuck! Are you fucking kidding me?! You're a gnat's ass away from having this conversation behind bars. Do you realize that? Jesus Christ, Tess! - What the hell are you trying to accomplish here? - What is this trying - to accomplish, Peter. - I'm following procedure! Procedure? Don't give me those company bullshit lines, huh? I know how they're gonna get that intelligence and it's gonna involve killing him. So please. We need the intelligence. Kelley is the one that has it. We've a common interest. Don't get in our way! Don't talk to me like I'm a civilian. I know this operation, Peter. I know what goes on beneath the dirt, okay? I hate to break it to you, Tess, but you are a civilian. And you forget that I know why they don't let you in the elevator past the ground floor. Fuck you, Peter! I need answers! And if you're not gonna give them to me, I know somebody who will. [car speeds away] [woman on PA] I'm getting you out of here. [phone rings] Who's this? [high pitched noise] [automated voice] At the French coast the time will be 8:20. Good night. [door handle clicking] [roaring sounds] [door bangs shut] [explosive sound] [groans] [whirring sounds] Good god! There's intelligence scattered fucking everywhere. [Goldstucker] If you lose something of value, you feel afraid, worried, surprised, sad? Do you need me to do anything? Help with arrangements? Make phone calls? [Amelia] Anything? Tess? Is everything okay. Yeah. I just haven't gotten any sleep, so I'm exhausted. What were you doing? Helping Kelley recover. - I thought the doctors... - The doctors don't know shit. I'm gonna get him out of this. Yeah. Okay. [bell tolls] [tense music] [helicopter propeller sound] [bell tolls] [electronic noise] Pick up the fucking phone! This is Agent Chandler... The first target city [panting] is Venice. - [man on phone speaking Italian] - Fuck! We're currently waiting for clearance. Uh, I need the executive order. [clears throat] We've hit a bit of a snag, but we will work through it, sir. Is the intelligence retrievable? I asked you a question. - It's not that simple, sir. - Well, make it simpler. Can we... extract... the intelligence? Well... That depends if we're talking about, uh, full extraction or an incremental extraction. We should also determine whether a pseudo source is created, so we can... A pseudo source should be created? What kind of bullshit is that, Peter? A full offline extraction will kill Agent Chandler, sir. I know what it'll do to Agent Chandler. Do you think Ah Puch is gonna sit around and take a holiday while we acknowledge one of our fallen? Of course not, sir. We celebrate different holidays. [ominous music] - [Peter shouts out in pain] - Shush! - [groaning] - I got another question for you, you got any balls there, son? - Because the future of your country is at stake. - [gasps] Yeah? I'm not gonna ask you again. - I'll get the answer. - Ah, damn right you will. [helicopter propeller sound] - Are you okay? - Fine. He didn't, uh, touch you inappropriately or anything, did he? What? Really, Scotty? He's practically blind. He survived a bomb attack, they say. Scares the shit out of me. So... Uh... Yeah, uh, don't worry. [roaring noises] [high pitched noise] [intolerable high pitched noise] [grunting] [woman on PA] [Dr. Nelson] I know this is a really bad time to be here. How's Kelley doing? He's... not good. How are you doing? [suspenseful music] I need to access him... [whimsical music] To bring him back. Please tell me you're taking your medication? Tess, I'm... I'm worried about your mental health. Given your prior history with this operation. [Kelley] She's experiencing side-effects. She's disoriented for the most part. Physical symptoms are nausea and loss of appetite. Any indication on what may have occurred? No. It's under investigation. Look, Kelley, they will stop at nothing to cripple you and corrupt the intelligence. You're aware of that? You think the intelligence was corrupted? Welcome to Nano-terrorism... [echoing] [Dr. A] Installing anti-viral vaccine. Can we retrieve the intelligence? That's an intriguing question. I don't think... that it's possible to do without examining the current condition of the hardware. Well, at this point, I don't think that's possible. The agent isn't in our possession. If he's in a hospital, it's very possible. [woman on PA] Wow. These invitations are beautiful. [Amelia] For a... birthday. - Something wrong? - I'm just... wondering who you're gonna invite. Kelley's friends. Our family. [Tess] The C.I.A. [Au Puch] Jerry. Jerry. Oh, ho-ho, Jerry. Place the card. [whimsical music] [Goldstucker] It will be impossible to gain access to the vault, without a code. [roaring sounds] [Goldstucker] We have engineered an automatic locking system that will allow optimum protection. A key-code created by you, and only known by you, will allow access. Even with the use of brute force, one would only compromise it. [?] Volunteer the intelligence. One could never gain access. So, the key-code will be stored outside the vault. And where would that be, exactly? - Hum. Close your eyes. - [slap] - [shouts out] - [mix of ethnic music fragments] - [groans] [mix of ethnic music fragments] [blasts and roars] [engine revving] [woman over radio] [bell tolling] [Kelley] Tess. Listen to me... This is a secret you cannot hide. I saw what happened. Whatever you got going on in there, it's not fucking worth it. Dump it, and get out. Dump it. I don't care about you. [Goldstucker] It upsets you to see an animal in pain? The wife? The wife is attempting to get the intelligence? Tess is looking for answers. Oh, tough shit. Her emotions are getting the best of her... again. You better not let her emotions get the best of you, Peter. I'll handle it. [sighs] The wife. That's all I need, is another wife... [dramatic music] Oh! [dramatic sound effects] [cars honking] [grunts] [spooky sounds] [groans] [high pitched noise] Good god... these black spots appear to be an abnormality. I think it's shifts of power. They appear to be slowly evolving. - [man] Is there a specific location or area? - Fuck. In and around the areas where... intelligence can be located. - They're fucking feeding off of it. - [man] Fascinating. [Kelley] Target cities seem to be mounting. It's unclear how they're gonna execute the plan. So I don't know if it's meaningless or if it's gonna save millions of lives. But someone's gonna die. Me... or millions of people. [voices chanting] [knocking on the door] [knocking on the door] [blast] [machines beeping] [calm music] [Tess] Can you be back by your birthday? [city noises] [Chinese speech] [dramatic music] - [thud] - [grunts] [sirens wailing] [tires squealing] What? Are you trying to get yourself killed? Come on! Get down! Call me Tits. My real name is Robert, but everyone calls me Tits. You know, Robert, Bob, Bobby, Boobs... Boobs... Then they started calling me Tits. Now everyone calls me Tits. You can call me Tits. Tell me where we're going. - This is a place where... - Does anyone really know where we're going? That's a question I always ask. It's your birthday. Yeah, we'll get you there, pal. This is crazy. Happy birthday, sweetie. I think you got a lot going on up there. Anything you wanna talk about? Listen, I know I'm just the getaway driver, I'm not supposed to get involved but you look like you're swimming in a sea of some serious shit, man. [Speaking in a foreign language] Air it out. What do you say? I got some aspirin in the glove compartment. How the hell do you get Dick out of Richard? You come up... You, Richard. Bob. Dick. - Call me Tits. - Oh, don't take this the wrong way, just get me to the fucking party. [tense music] [voices behind door] [high pitched noise] [muffled voices] [roaring sound] [singing behind doors] ♪ ...birthday to you ♪ Happy birthday, dear Kelley ♪ Happy birthday to you Happy birthday, Kelley. Tess, could I have a moment, please? Hi. - What are you doing? - Throwing Kelley a birthday party. - You're fucking with the process. - Yeah? What exactly is the fucking process, huh? - You know I can't tell you that. - Real talk. It's me. - Times have changed. - I think I above everybody else deserve to know. You, above everybody else, know that this is classified information. Go home. Take a shower. Have a hot meal. - Have some faith in me. - Then give me a reason to! [distant laughter] [tense music] [high pitched noise] [Tess] Do you think they will be able to... Keep it together. OK? Keep it together. They can't. They don't have the technology for that. It's you. It's me. It's us... Gone. [woman on PA] Hey, kiddo. Tess, I'm gonna tell you this because I care. I overheard the guests talking. They thought that this party was... slightly demented. And, maybe... you're starting to lose it again. [loud purring sound] I'd rather them think that I'm losing it than lose him. [Tess] It's not gonna happen. - [giggles] - Baby, I wanna ask you something. [beeping] Cheeseburger and fries. - Tess. Wait, wait, wait. - [beep, beep, beep] Think about what we do. [bells tolling] [beeping] If one of us goes down, - which is likely to happen... - You want to marry me? [beeping] The other one stays and helps the other one out. It's not gonna happen. [phone rings] [phone rings] [buzz] Kelley. [dial tone] [beeping] Come on. Anything. [high pitched noise] [alarm beeping] Come on... [dial tone] Kelley. [alarm beeping] Oh, fuck! You better hope to God. [voice over PA] Patient temperature increasing. [phone beeping] Yes! [Goldstucker] They will stop at nothing to cripple you and corrupt the intelligence. Shit... [alarm beeping] Listen up: [Morse code] Venice. New York. Turkey. Mexico City. Code your name. 12-12? [alarm beeping] [tapping sounds] - [door opens] - I'm sorry. These were at the front desk. Thank you. [door closes] Kelley. Come back. I'm still here. [dramatic sound effects] [sighs] [tense music] [Goldstucker] You tend to have very strong opinions about morality. [calm music] [woman on PA] Preparing patient for removal. [automated door humming] [clock strikes] Would you like something to drink? - Whisky? - Like I said, no thank you. [Lauren] No. [Lauren] I think you do. I'd rather you just tell it to me straight. Did you have any children together? No. Hum. We wanted children. I wanted eight. You plus who wanted eight? [suspenseful music] Take it. It's the only thing that's gonna quiet the war happening between your head and your heart. [voices on radio] [siren] - [paramedic] Prepare an MRI. - [operator] Alright 21... As you're aware, the assignments can be strenuous. [Lauren] We often find ourselves in remote locations for extended periods of time. Kelley and I were to exchange intelligence. Unfortunately, we exchanged much more. Too much. I'm sorry. - He told me you suffered from side effects. - Yes. [tense music] - I'm looking for Kelley Chandler. - He was transferred - at 7:00 a.m. this morning. - Transferred? What are you talking about, transferred? Transferred to where? - Location... Saint Johns. - Come on, come on. - Saint Johns? - It's a long-term care facility. [truck honking] [truck honking] [ominous music] Do you know the history of this agent? Additional images will allow us to see in greater detail what may be causing this abnormality. May I suggest further testing? [Peter] Thank you. We're finished. Six, seven, eight, nine, ten target cities. Uh, you missed two. - Your calls, guy. - Twelve cities. Twelve bombs. - Jesus Christ. - 12-12 is the file name we keep coming across. Then, uh, we have some clearer images that we could analyze, but for the most part, the intelligence is completely corrupted and continues to deteriorate. - What you're watching here is the brain slowly dying. - What I always wanted to watch. Is the intelligence fully retrievable? I would highly recommend not removing any intelligence. - And why is that? - The ratio of success is very low. [Dr. A] It's no different than, uh, if your hard drive crashed. It's extremely difficult to remove the data. We could try, but we would destroy our agent in the process. Oh, well, your recommendation is duly noted. - [Hotchkiss] Let's get on with it. - [Peter] Sir, he said the chances are low. We have an obligation - to do whatever it takes to save our agent... - Let me explain something to you, Peter. If agent Kelley was alive here today, he would be the first one to order it's retrieval, at any cost! 'Cause that was the risk he was prepared to take when he accepted this assignment. - Ain't that right, Scotty? - Yeah. Yeah. And that's why he was chosen! He took on this assignment under the protection of this agency. - And now you're failing to protect him! - We're at war, son! And there are casualties! Now, keep your fucking eye on the ball! Scotty, keep an eye on him. I'll take a leak. [background chatter] I'm looking for Kelley Chandler. - Room 305. Third floor. - Thank you. [respirator hissing] Honey. I swear I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch. What did they do to you? [phone rings] - What are you guys doing to him? - You think I have a choice? - I am stuck in the crossfire here, Tess. - Then take a side, Peter, because he's gonna die in a place like this. Well, frankly, at this point I think that's the idea. - You fucking asshole! - Hey! Listen to me! This is about what is in his head. The intelligence is there and it is retrievable. The problem is we do not have the time. Hotchkiss wants it yesterday. I wanna speak to Goldstucker. Are you fucking crazy? Goldstucker lives off the grid. You're not listening to me. You have to accept the reality of the situation here. What does 12-12 mean to you? - Where did you hear that? - Like I said: I want to speak to Goldstucker. [woman on PA] [Goldstucker] I want you to imagine the desert. The sand. The Sun. The heat. The wind that gets in your face. Open your eyes. While I was speaking, you did see an image. - Correct. - Where is that image? The image of that desert is in your imagination. Call it consciousness. Trans-personal consciousness. For hundreds of years poets, philosophers, scientists artists, you name it, have been searching for it, without ever locating it. That is where we store your key-code. In your consciousness. Here you go. Goldfinger's contact as requested. - It's Goldstucker. - Yeah, whatever. Goldpecker. This dude was a bitch to find. Be careful paying him a visit. I don't think he wants to be found. Don't thank me now. But I'm not even going to ask how you obtained classified information that only Kelley could have. But if anyone even wonders if you're tampering with evidence, I cannot help you. Do you understand me? Yes. I can't say he'll exactly be thrilled to talk to you. He wasn't too happy that our people were looking for him. So, you guys are gonna kill him? I never said that. - [dialing tone] - [operator in Spanish] [high pitched noise] [busy tone] - Watch him? - Look, you can text, talk, do whatever you like. - Just don't leave that room, OK? - This is the part where I try to talk some sense into you. I'm not gonna lie, this is frickin' strange. I moved to this god-forsaken shit pit, 'cause Mom and Dad wanted me to help you. We just went beyond that. I understand watching your cat when you go on vacay, but... - I don't trust anybody, OK? - No, no, no... Don't you leave that room. Not even for five minutes. - That's why they have nurses. - There's protection under the bed. - Protection? - Fourteen rounds in the clip, one in the chamber. [monitor beeping] [GPS giving directions] [radio playing music] [loud blast] [dramatic music] [grunting] [groans] Can I, uh, help you here, ma'am? Boy, these cars, they don't do good in the heat, do they. - [thud] - [groaning] - Argh! Jesus! Fuck me! - Tell them they're getting sloppy. Who? I'm sorry, ma'am. I want no business with you. The God honest truth. Argh! [gasping & coughing] Fuck. [panting] Keep it together. - [man] What's going on? - [Amelia] I'm really worried about Tess. - She's acting crazy. - [man] Oh, great. OK, I can't do this on my own anymore. I need your help. [man] I'm gonna call Mom and Dad. - [man] Was she detained? - Okay. - She got away. - How the fuck did that happen? Because she's good! She's real good. Shit. Let's begin. Six characters and numbers. Twenty-two. Color. Black. Imagine a name. Contessa Ford. An action or emotion. Running. A specific place. Tulum, Mexico. That will be your key-code. Those images will unlock the vault. [crow cawing] [suspenseful music] [suspenseful music] [gun being cocked] [high pitched noise] [Kelley] They're targeting stadiums. Shopping centers. Parks. Fairgrounds. Mass Transit. Trains. Buses. Rental cars. I know it's not my business, but... I'm here to talk about Kelley. He's in a coma. And? And I need your help. [chuckles] It's not the reaction I was hoping for. I'm sorry. But you're telling me our safety measures worked. Under stress... the safe was supposed to lock automatically. It did! And you could unlock it? Just how incapacitated is he? He's receiving some codes. - Do you have access to his key code? - Key code? - The key code was your only chance. - And how hard is it to hack it? I would say it's impossible... if you weren't his wife. The code is based on M.R.S. Memory Retrieval Stimulation. A positive memory... stimulates the release of the neurotransmitter dopamine. The key code is a simple sequence of six characters or phrase that acts as just such a release. Allowing the safe to unlock. Spontaneously. [in foreign language] So, what exactly am I'm looking for? Images. Music. Books. Love letters. Sounds simple. It isn't. And it is. [groans] [dramatic music] [high pitched noise] [Tits] What the hell, man? Hey. Anyway, I got you something. It's chock full of hollow points. Don't be afraid to use it, OK? Hey, hey! Oh, Jesus! Whoa! Whoa! No, no! Get away from me! - I have hotel surveillance. - I look forward to reading your report. You're not going to watch it? I know the ending. He dies in a coma. - But there could be something... - I don't know about you, Scotty, but I don't get off watching my friends get their ass handed to them. For the record, neither do I. [voice on PA] Agent Noah, please report to intelligence retrieval. I love you. [Dr. Nelson] Good morning, Tess. You are probably wondering what we're all doing in your living room. Well, it looks like an intervention. Are you behind this? Amelia was involved in this because she's worried about you. They're all here because they love you. So, please... They just want you to hear them out. The donuts are a nice touch. Hey! Whoa! No, no, no, no! Let me go. They're not dead! I forgot [indistinct] It's me, Tits, Tits. Tits! Get off of me. - Are you real? - Real? Real what? I'm real fucking scared! It's Tits. That's right. It's tits. You wanna touch Tits? Go ahead. - Who, who am I? - Yeah. Are you kidding? Come on. See. I'm real. [gunshot and glass shattering] - [people shouting] - [sirens wailing] [tires squealing] [grunts] Honey... it's time to let him go. We'll help you through it any way we possibly can. You have to know that. What's life's support if... if there's no life to support? You know I love you. I'm no expert on death but I think... Tommy... I love you. If you're about to give me the Circle of Life speech, I will gut you with a pencil. - Tess... - [Douglas] Look, I think it's fair that you know, that the CIA is thinking about filing federal tampering charges. It's a scare tactic. I don't think so. OK? I think you have mightily pissed these people off. They're sick and fucking tired of you. And you are directly in their crosshairs. They're gonna have to kill me, if they want to kill him. Well, I'll be sure to let them know that. Why are they paying us to talk to you? Say that again? Why are they paying us to talk to you? [Kelley] Wait, wait... I want to ask you something. Wait, wait. Come here. I care about you. Tess? What did they offer you? You all claim to be his friends, his family. Huh? So, how much was it? One million dollars? Five? Ten? Anybody? Nothing? You guys have nothing? I just wanna let you know, that I'm not gonna let any of you cash him in. [loud electronic noises] He's gone ape shit. - [gunshot] - Ow! No, you're not supposed to shoot me. [groaning] - [gunshot] - [cars honking] [grunts] [dramatic music] [grunts] [violent sound effects] - [woman on PA] - [machine beeping] Today could be the day, right? Come on, sweetie. [violent sound effects] Beach. Because there's not much time. Twenty-two. [violent sound effects] Red. Twenty-two. Sunset. [cars honking] Come on, sweetie. [grunts] [siren wailing] [seagull squawking] Red. Come on. Twenty-two. [dramatic music] [electronic buzz] I'm following concerning the health and well-being of Tess. Thank you. [tense music] [beeping Morse code] Kelley, listen to me! Come on! - [phone ringing] - [officer] You're under arrest for tampering with federal evidence. [Tess grunts] Get out! Get off me! [panting] If he even had the slightest chance I wouldn't have let this happen. You left us no other choice, Tess. Choices. There were choices. You have to trust me. I'm protecting you. No. You're trying to protect yourself. [scoffs] What's gonna happen now? She'll undergo psychiatric evaluation. Depending on the outcome the hospital can legally hold her for the next 48 hours. So, she's safe. - Thank you. - God bless you. [waves breaking] [Goldstucker] This completes the evaluation. Her past. Your present. The future. It has no place. She doesn't know where she's at. She must remove the intelligence immediately. There must have been a breach. A breach in her logic. She's not going in. She's paranoid. She wakes up every day thinking the world is going to end. Until she removes the intelligence, she may never recover. You believe that you were communicating with your husband through the use of Morse code. You wanna tell me about that conversation? Kelley is currently holding intelligence detailing 12 nuclear bombs destined for 12 different countries. But, unfortunately, he's been infected by a virus. Wow. Okay. Uhm... Is this the same virus we were talking about 18 months ago? The one that gave me nightmares, yes. Do you think I'm insane? I didn't say that. Ah. Doctor Nelson is recommending that you stay here indefinitely, Tess. You know, next time, you may want to leave out the bullshit about the 12 bombs and the virus. Bring on the medication. The only medicine you need right now, is the fucking truth. And the sooner you swallow it, the sooner you'll realize this whole little fucking seance of yours is over. - It's not over. - Oh, really? Do you see yourself getting out of here anytime soon? Do you? 'Cause I don't. You were lucky that you got out the last time. Kelley got me out last time. OK. [clears throat] Guess what. Kelley is not getting you out of here. This is getting you out of here. Kelley can't save you. So, wake the fuck up. [man] It was meant to be. It'll be just what you want it to be. Look for the light. Do your rights in the name of the Lord. As it is said, for ever and ever. And never, ever. Hmm. Boy, you are a sight for sore eyes. Why are you so upset with me? I didn't put you in here, you did. Why don't you just leave Kelley alone? I'm not sure if, uh, those are the kind of questions I'd be asking if I were you. I'd be asking myself, uh, why am I still alive. Why I haven't been killed. Why I haven't pulled the plug on Kelley when he arrived. Those are the kind of questions I'd be asking if I were you, and I'll tell you why. Because me and you, we have the same goal. - No, we don't. - Oh, yes we do, young lady! We just have maybe a different approach to it. Begging by his bedside just isn't my style, if you know what I mean. Although I have heard now that you've had some positive results and I want to hear about them. So, while I'm far from begging, I am prepared to sit by your bedside. [Hotchkiss grunts] - Don't touch me! - Oh, sorry. I put my hand on your toes? You know I can't see very well. - What can you tell me? - Nothing. You have intelligence that'll save millions of lives, young lady. You better tell me something. I only care about one. Careful, I might have lost most of my sight but I've not lost my sense of smell. You're beginning to rot. Leave. It was truly lovely to see you again, Spider. Really lovely. [click] You can't keep hiding. Dump it. Get your life back. [Kelley] We'll get our life back. I wish I could. But you know where I'd go. I'd go back to the beach. [Tess] Remember when we went to Mexico? Back to the water. [Tess] When no one knew what we were. It was perfect. Nobody knew us. It was just you and me. Just you and me together. Do you really think that they'll be able to sort through what's rightfully mine and what's theirs? [Tess] They can't. They don't have the technology for that. That's you. That's me. That's us. Gone. I agreed that they could have my head. I never agreed that they could have my heart. Tess. I'm so sorry, Tess. I was just worried about you. I brought you your mail. [door closes] [sighs] Even on your payroll. How about that, huh? Oh my god. [gunshot] - [grunts] - [thud] I'm who you're dealing with! [exhales] Well played. Well played. [exhaling] [grunting] At cuckoo's nest with big sis. I forgive you. [tires squealing] Stay in the car. No problem. I'm not gonna argue with that. Take a look at this. You're asking me to bet my whole life on a postcard. What other choice do we have? [sighs] Aiding and abetting... that's 20 years. Ten years on good behavior. Fuck it. - Hey! You guys been getting my calls? - No, sir. Let's go! Emergency. East gate. Now! - Twenty minutes. That's it. - Okay. Okay. - Let's begin. - So great. [beeping Morse code] Come on, Kelley. Come on. Come on, Kelley. Come on, Kelley. Come back here. - Six characters, a number. - Twenty-two... - An action. A motion. - Running. - A color. - Black. Come on, Kelley. Come on. - Imagine a name. - Ford. [Morse code] Stay with me. [glass shattering] Put the gun down, Tess, and let him die. You fucking cunt! - You're too late. - Come on! - Come on, Kelley! - Sometimes to save lives, - you have to take lives. - One step closer and I'll put a fucking bullet in your head. [grunting] You can't stop 12-12. - [cocks gun] - Drop it! - Drop the gun! - Peter. What are you doing? Killing a virus. Finally, a specific place. The beach. Mexico. - We're all virus... - Tulum. - [gun goes off] - [glass shatters] [gunshots] [Tess] Come on, Kelley. Get up. [Tess] Please, get up. [Tess] What are you doing? Get up! [Tess] Come on. [Tess sighs] [calm music] [beeping Morse code] I love you, Tess. [bells tolling] I'm gonna get you out. Kelley? Complete. Subtitles by explosiveskull
