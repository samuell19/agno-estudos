A university in England studied 24,282 people for lucid dreams in 2016 55% said they experienced lucid dreaming at least once in a lifetime 22% of them replied that they experienced it regularly more than once a month Some of them said They could control their dreams Hey. Why are you not sleeping? Hong-hwa. Hong-hwa. Please don't do this to me. - Hong-hwa. - Why did you do that? Hong-hwa! Please save me. Please save my life. Please save me. Yeah, it's me. Really? I see. I'll go to the scene right now. You idiot, are you here to play? When has it been discovered? It's been two hours. Two hours? I'm going crazy. We need to investigate it more, but how to damage the body and dump it is similar to the Minga-dong torso murder. Shit! How many times did it happen? Again, the body was cut into eight pieces. We already know that. Isn't there any new information? Aren't you ashamed you're getting paid for poor performance? We found three dismembered bodies within two months. Does it make sense that we don't have any clue? Hey, when has he arrived? Hey. Where have you been in this state of affairs? You must be coming from not your home by the look of you. Please don't mind others' business. You should've changed your dress. I could smell a woman's cosmetics when you appeared atop the hill. You crazy guy! I don't know who you are seeing. I want you to consider a serious relationship. You will live alone if you don't consider having a serious relationship. Look who's talking. Don't get kicked out of your home like last time. Hey! That's such an old story. By the way, why don't you visit my home someday? My wife wants to treat you one more time. No, that's okay. Who knows? My wife might introduce a pretty woman to you. Why have you come again? Don't you think it's too much in the morning? If you want to work out, go out and do it. You've been nagging me, so I bought a mat not to make noise. I think you're too sensitive. You're the one who makes me sweat. Don't I have the right to work out in my home? Come over to my home and hear how noisy it is. Why do I have to do that? Anyway, please be quiet. If you can't stand the noise, move out. He's become wilder. The dismembered part is much rough. He must've dismembered the body to abandon it before, but now he must be enjoying it. He's a total wacko. You should hurry up and catch him. If you miss him, he'll be more cruel. This kind of type won't stop until he satisfies himself. My gut feeling is that another murder case will occur soon. He might be wandering to look for prey somewhere else. I'm dying to know who he is. Don't you think so? Once you start, you can't stop it. What? What did you say? Where are you going? Let's go together. Keep up the good work. - Can you ring this up, please? - Yes. - Do you need a plastic bag? - No. It's 3,500 won. It's 1,000 won. Could you put it in here? Yoo Hong-hwa? Is everything okay? I'm okay. It's been a while since we met. Don't you remember our meeting last week? Really? I wanted to meet you because I've been dreaming of a weird dream. Dream? What kind of? You are... Never mind. I think I got stressed due to the exhibition. How is your dad? It's the same old. I hope he'll be getting better. Thank you for your worrying about him. When I visited your home in childhood, he used to give me pocket money. He treated me very well. We hung out together every day in college, so everyone thought we were seeing each other. How's your exhibition? It's on the last stage. I know you're busy, but please make time for it. I see. Don't worry. I hope you'll have your exhibition soon. Have you caught some fish? No. It's hard to catch fish today. Do you remember that when I was young, you used to let me get on a swing? Those were the days. Then, you can remember you said you would marry me, right? Did I say that? I must've told a lie to get on a swing. What? I want to go back to the days we lived together. Why... Why don't you stop it? You and your mom have done enough. What are you talking about? I know you gave up opening an exhibition due to my hospital bill. If I can't help, I don't want to interrupt you. You must've been having a tough time. I'm fine. I can open an exhibition later when I want. That's not that important. Dad. I have to go now. I'll come back to you. You must've felt tired. How do you feel these days? The insomnia is getting serious. I almost can't sleep without the pill. That's a common symptom to test subjects. It will be all right after a while. Yes. Today is the last test day. How many pills are left? Approximately two weeks. Keep in mind that you must throw it away. If you keep taking it, you might be unable to distinguish between reality and a dream or get a serious side effect. Until now, there aren't any side effects, but you can fall into a coma. The rest of the payment will be paid within this week. Once again, we won't be responsible for any side effects from now on. When did you come? I'll be with him. Take some rest at home. I'm okay. You must be more tired than me. I dealt with the hospital bill on the way. Please check it out. You must be having a hard time, too. Thank you. Hey... Never mind. Did you eat a meal? Yes. The victim's last phone signal was in Kyuhong-dong, Cheongan-si, located more than 30km from where the body was found. It's close to where the other two bodies, which the same killer presumably killed, were found. Haven't you found something at that place? I couldn't find anything. Within a 6km radius, the terrain consists of fields, paddies, and mountains. It's very hard to find a witness, let alone a CCTV. We have the worst luck. What about those suspects? I couldn't find anything special. I've checked all their alibis. We have a long way to go. It's 18,500 won. Shit! Where's my wallet? Give me a pack of cigarettes. Which brand do you want? Shit! Just give me anything! It's 4,500 won. Come on! Hey! Ji-eun. Who are you? Ah... It was you, right? It's fun. Can you enter other people's dreams, too? Ji-eun, are you okay? What? What are you talking about? What time is it now? Where are you now? I'm home. What's wrong? You're okay, right? Of course. What's wrong with you? In a dream, Dream? Never mind. It's nothing if you're all right. Sorry for waking you up. Yes. It's me. After hanging up, I've come to the thought of it. My dream was weird. Do you remember? I mean... I can't tell because it's too cruel. It must be a silly dream. Why are you still waking up? I just couldn't sleep. You must be tired. Go to sleep. I have to wake up early. I need more sleep. I'll hang up. Yes. Good night. It's fine. I'll protect you from now on. Don't be afraid. I said you're fine. You're fine. I'm telling you. Pretty. Yeah, you're pretty. Yes. I'll send the money this week. I said I would send it. How many times should I tell you? I've never experienced it since we lived together. She's been out of touch for a few days and hasn't come home. She's been stressed these days. So she might rest somewhere quiet. If so, I'm relieved. She'll contact you soon. Don't worry too much. If you get a contact from her, please let me know. - I see. - Please. - Yes. - I'll go. Too loud! Too loud! Ji-eun! What happened to you? A crazy bitch kidnapped me. Please save me. Do you know where it is? Think carefully about where it is. Run! Run! Hey! Why? You have a visitor. - Who? - You'd better come out. He always wakes me up like this. So, you're saying he's the criminal? I can't assure you he is a criminal, but you can find my friend if you find him. Did you witness the crime scene? No. It's hard to explain, but he must be related to the case. If you don't explain, we can't begin the investigation. You won't believe my word although I explain it. I'll judge it after listening. You should explain in detail to get help from me. Although it's hard to believe, I can enter other people's dreams. My friend asked for my help in her dream. So, you're here to report what you saw in a dream? What a crap! I know it's weird to enter a dream, but... Excuse me. I don't know which condition you're on. Why don't you visit a nearby hospital? Goodbye. I'll sleep for a while, so if the chief finds me, wake me up. I'm going crazy. You should believe me. What? Who are you? We met at the police station a bit ago. I'm Yoo Hong-hwa. Yoo Hong-hwa? I said I could enter other people's dreams. Ah, I remember you. A little bit insane... Where are we now? It's your dream. My dream? Please believe my words. My friend's life is at risk. If you don't believe me, try to find this person. She'll explain everything. Why are you here? What? The chief is calling you. It's me. Mom, please calm down. He'll be all right. I'll go there right now. Try to find this person. She'll explain everything. Shit! Hello, This is Seo Yung-yeong, the senior researcher. Hey. Why are you so serious? What? It's not a big deal. Where are you going? He always says it's nothing. What is this? Are you saying Yoo Hong-hwa, whom you met in your dream, told you to come here? Yes. I know it's total nonsense. That makes sense a bit. Have you ever heard of a lucid dream? It's a situation in which a person realizes that his dream is a dream. There is a typical symptom of lucid dreaming. They can control their dreams. If so, can they enter other people's dreams? I don't know why he's making us have a hard time. Mom. If he keeps making us suffer like this... Please. He might hear us. We don't know when he'll wake up. We're short of money. I'm really tired of caring for him. I'm sure he'll wake up. I'll take care of the hospital bill. So, please cheer up. Okay? Was it really you who I saw in my dream? Last year I applied for a clinical test for new drugs from a pharmaceutical company for my dad's hospital bill. The drug is to treat depression using a state of sleep. Since taking it, I realized that I had a weird ability. Is that the ability to enter a dream? Yes. Hey. Yes. You want to save your friend, right? Yes. If your saying is true, No. Let's say it's true. If you save your friend, you should find out where he is as entering your friend's dream. I'll bet he'll kill your friend soon. We should find him before he kills her. You bastard! Die! You bastard! Die! Die! You bastard! Die! I'm sorry, Dad. Come on, you bastard! Look straight! Look straight! Look straight, you bastard! What? Hey. Where have you been leaving me alone? Are you having an affair? You're waiting for me like this. How can I have an affair? It's been a while. Right. Do you remember I told you to drop by to eat together? However, he couldn't make time. He was too busy. Anyway, what brought you here? As you know, we've been working late at night. She brought underwear and food for me. Are you jealous? I'll go. Right now? Let's eat together, my better half. I told you not to call me a better half. You're my wife. What else can I call you? I said I don't like it. I see. I won't call you a better half. Have some time and eat with your wife. I wanted to meet you. You've come here on your own feet. I have been waiting for you. What? Haven't you come here to meet me? If you want to save your friend, follow me. Here is... It's your house. Please tell me where she is. Then I won't report. Please. Do you really save your friend? Yes. Is that what you really want? What do you mean? Did you kill her already? Have you ever wanted to kill someone? No. I'm not a murderer like you. Really? If you don't kill someone in reality, you can kill anyone in your dream. When could you enter a dream? Tell me. In return, I'll let you know where your friend is. Tell me. Okay? Tell me. A few years ago, my dad fell into a coma after falling due to a cerebral hemorrhage. I had to fall asleep worrying about him every day. One day, I took medicine, and I could meet him in my dream on that day. In the beginning, I thought it was a normal dream. However, it wasn't. You must have shared a great memory with your dad. So, how's your dad? He's still in a coma in a hospital. All right. I'm excited after a long time. Is she making noise again? Stop it! What's wrong with you? If you want to lose weight, you shouldn't eat food. Don't behave fastidiously like working out at home. What are you going to do? Just wait for more. How long do I have to wait? I feel stuffy. I'm almost choked to death. You know we don't have any specific way. Let's watch for opportunities. You're repeating it. What an opportunity! Hong-hwa. Please open the door, Hong-hwa. Hey! Hey! Thank you. Hong-hwa. Hong-hwa. Hey. Hey. Wake up, Hong-hwa. Why isn't she able to wake up? We also haven't seen this kind of case. She seems to be asleep, but she doesn't come to her senses. We have no other way but to watch her. You get a kick out of it, right? How could you suppress your emotions? Most people suppress their anger. You don't need to suppress anymore. Feel what you want slowly. You won't believe what I'm saying over the phone. I'm doing it just to grasp for straws. Where are you now? I think I should stay here today. If someone finds me, please make an excuse for me. I have something to say to you. What is it? That's... Never mind. I'll tell you when I know it clearly. I see. What are you looking at? Hush! Who is he? He's returned to school this year. He looks handsome, right? Come on. Come on. Hello. Hello. - Are you okay? - Yes. What are you doing tonight? I have nothing to do. Then, why don't we have dinner together? What? Yes. Stop it. Let's see your face. It's itchy. Please stay still. Hold on. Hold on. It's itchy. What are you doing? Don't you want to kill both of them? Your best friend had an affair with your husband, but you didn't ditch your friend. Why did you do that? You must have wanted to kill her, right? Tell me the truth. Do you want your friend to die painfully? That's what you want, right? No. No... No... You're so fun. If you can't, I can kill her instead of you. Please be honest. Do you think it works out? Tell me where my friend is. Hurry up and tell me. Where is my friend? Bang! I'm sorry. Hong-hwa! Are you okay? Where am I? I've brought you to a hospital because you didn't wake up. Have you found where your friend is? No. If we can't find her quickly, he will kill her. Please save me. Please save me. He also can control his dream. That's why I couldn't wake up. Do you mean that you were stuck in his dream? Was there any clue? What about his dress or unique behavior? He looks weird. He seems to be insane. I don't know. What should I do? Why don't you understand what I'm saying? I'm out. Mind your own business. You're loud. Hey. This way. - It's fun. - That's enough. - No, no. - I want to do it. Ji-eun, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry... When did you arrive? What? What have you got to say? Why are you frowning? These days, my wife seems weird. I couldn't tell what the difference was, but my hunch said there was something. Although it stands in the same place, it can look different. I've hired someone to make a secret investigation about her. What if she is seeing someone? You're still not sure. I'm sure there's something. If she's having an affair, I'll kill that bastard. We still have something to talk yet, right? Is it you? What? The beacon does not shine on its own base. You bastard! How dare you could do this to me? You bastard! Hong-hwa! Hong-hwa! Hey, stop! You bastard! He's the criminal. Let's talk after arresting him. I'll explain everything. Okay? Hong-hwa! Hong-hwa! That bastard! Hey. That bastard! Are you okay? Go and catch him! You bastard! Don't move. You bastard! Did you shoot me? What the fuck! No. It's impossible. No way, I was trying to... Did you shoot me? I'm sorry. We tried our best but failed to save him. Shit! Hello. I'm keeping your dad. I'll send you an address. You'd better hurry up. Don't come over with any company. He can only survive a few hours. If you fail to find him in a day, he'll die. What should I do? The phone is off. After the beep... You've come earlier than I expected. As you asked me, I'm here. Please send my dad back. I used to visit here with my mom when I was young. If he doesn't return to the hospital quickly, he can die. That's what you want. What are you talking about? I imagined killing my dad every night. One day, he was really dead. Was it a dream or reality? What is this? Please hear me out. It's related to you. I don't want to hear it. Tell me where my dad is. Where is my dad? Pull yourself together. You said you wanted to find your dad. Why do you keep sleeping like this? Dad! Where is my dad? Please send him back. Hurry up and tell me where he is. He's dead. What? He's dead. Everything is clear. Dad... Is he dead? Why did you kill him? He didn't have anything to do with you. It's what you wanted. What? Think deeply. Who did the most want him to die? He might not survive for a few weeks. We don't know when he'll wake up. We're short of money. Yes. I'll send the money. Hey! Be quiet! Too loud! Too loud! I hope you'll have your exhibition soon. I paid the hospital bill. Too loud! Mom and I are having a tough time. I'm sorry. No way! No way! Do you like fishing? I like it. Is it a dream or reality? That kind of thing isn't important anymore. Why on earth do you do this to me? Now you admit it. We aren't different. No. We are different. Like you aren't a monster, I'm not a monster. No. You're a monster. Shoot me. I know you want to kill me now. Grab the gun. Every human thinks the same way. They kill others to save their lives. That's human. That's why your friend was dead. Right. I'm human, not a murderer. It's you who killed Ji-eun. You could save your friend's life. However, the mind that you wanted your friend to die killed her. It's the same case for your dad. Do not justify your killing your dad like this. No. No. - No. - Shoot me. No. No. No. If you don't kill me, I'll kill you. I won't kill you. The murderer is you. I'm just a normal person. Do you remember asking why I don't kill people as much as I want in a dream? That's why I've become a murderer. I killed many people in my dreams, so I can't feel any guilty conscience. You're going to be where I'm about now. No. No. No. - Shoot me. - No. Shoot me! Look, I said we're the same. How was the funeral? I'm sorry that I couldn't help you. He's in an intensive care unit. A doctor says there are no life-threatening symptoms, but he is still unconscious. It's like you were stuck in his dream before. He might be having a dream he won't want to return from. How many pills are left? Approximately two weeks. Keep in mind that you must throw it away. If you keep taking it, you might be unable to distinguish between reality and a dream or get a serious side effect. Until now, there aren't any side effects, but you can fall into a coma.
