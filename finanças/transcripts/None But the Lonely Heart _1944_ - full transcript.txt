Oy, what's this? What's this tonight? Memorial services. Armistice day tomorrow, you know. Stay there, nipper. It might be my son. Might. Might be my old man. Might. Good night. Night. When ernie mott, humble citizen of the city of london, saw for the first time the tomb of the unknown warrior, he little realized that he, ernie mott, might someday soon become the unknown warrior of a second world war. Yes, someday soon, he might become a glowing legend for happy boys and girls, living a life he merely dreamed about. High destiny for quiet ernie mott, who quarreled, hungered, loved, and was loved. For this is his story- the story of ernie mott, who searched for a free, a beautiful, and noble life in the second quarter of the 20th century. Ernie, grub's ready. Don't be all year, or you'll fight the birds for it. Won't be but a minute, ma. Yes, yes, yes. Here. Don't you think pork sausage is too good for the beast? Stay. Come on. Nothing too good for that dog, ma. Part of myself, he is. Don't like him, do you? Where you been? Oh, knocking about a bit up north, all over the shop. What's up? Why? You're standing there looking as if i'd jabbed you with your hatpin or something. What did you come back home for, son? Miss me? Can't say i did, ma. You know me, ducky, tramp of the universe. Anything in the shop needs mending, ma? Nothing that needs your help, ernie, sweets. Besides, it's sunday. Painting, polishing, doing a spot of gardening? Mean to do my best by you, ma, love. Happy couple, aren't we? A bit of proper respect is what's needed. I get no more from you than i got from that father of yours. And that's that. That's that. So you got your choice. What choice? Stay or get out. Take hold here and do a man's job, or don't come back. Stay put so i don't keep fretting my fat about you. What call have you to go wandering around the country like a breath of homeless wind? Don't i treat you right, or what? Okey-doke. I'll be off in the morning. How is it, ernie boy? Home for a time? How'd you know i was back, ma? I live so close, i can hear you change your mind. Nice music on the old wireless. Don't know what i'd do without it. The piano needs tuning, too. I'll stop in and look at it around teatime. Thanks, ernie. Hello, dad. When are you mending that window? Catch me mucking around with a window, ern boy. Life's too short. You're a man after my own heart, dad. Woman: Ern! See you. Been home long? Bring yourself in for a cup of tea. Me basket's full of breakfast. Come in anyway, ern. Practicing? It's a living. It pays to keep your tools sharp. Good to be back. Nicest drawing room in the neighborhood, this, aggie. It's yours whenever you want it. Have to take you, too, aggie? You want me to move out? * he's the boy for me * * i'm the girl for him * * he's my lump of toffee, cake, and pudding ** you're the biggest fool i ever met, aggie. Why? Black as the ace, i am. Don't you know it yet? Matter of fact, ma give me the ultimatum today. Stay put or stay out. What are you going to do about it? Something. What? Something. You're a little flat there, aggie. What's the music called? None but the lonely heart. Italian? No. Russian. Nice. Oh, well. See you tonight? Tonight? About 9:00? All alike, you women. I don't go on timetables like a train. I'm ernie mott. I don't stay put. I understand. Do you? Of course. Well, then maybe i'll see you tonight. Nipper. Maybe i will... or maybe i won't. Who give you that dimple in your chin? Present from me pa. Bye, aggie. Bye, ernie boy. Watch her, peggy. Hello. Hi, elsie. Hello. What's coming off? Sunday or ain't it? Nobody home. Nobody home. It's me, dad. Ernie mott. Oh, you, is it? Ain't seen you in 3 months, have i? You're blocking the door, dad. Miss me, did you? Had your post card from up north. No grass grows under your feet. How do we get some smokes? I'm so broke, i'm two halves. What, again? You think it grows on trees? You're not giving me the boot? What cigars you got? May we feed the fishes? No! The way those kids carry on, ern. Cigars, dad. Oh, cigars. Well, i've got a very doubtful stock of them, ern. Can't make out what happens to things lately. I got an old burma cheroot somewhere. I got more respect for me guts, i have. Give us a large rigby's. Can't sell cigarettes on sunday, you know, ern. Who said anything about selling? A large rigby's it is. A gent! Proper lovely to be alive and have friends like you, dad. I'm remembering you in my will. You don't think i'll live? How's your ma? Like an engine. Tower of london isn't better. Bye, dad. Drop in again. Here you are, folks. Learn how to do it... come on here, folks. 3 for a penny. Come along. Here is the best shot of the day... here you are. Go on. Hold me dog, please, mate. Show them how it's done. Oy, stand back. Let the man see the rabbit. Now, gents, watch the fur fly. Quiet, please, while the shots is took. Ha ha ha! There we are! 8 shots, and all where they should be- right in the black hole of calcutta. I told you who he was, and this is him. Governor, here are your fags, and good luck to you. Thanks for holding me dog. Oh, hello. Haven't i seen you before? Here's a present for you. Here you are. , out of tune. I'm mordinoy. Jim mordinoy. Am i supposed to know you? Thought as how you might. Ever fight your pup? Never. What about the piano? What about it? Should i tune it? Cost you half a bar. Life's easier than that. Take a quid and leave the piano undisturbed. Now why would i take your quid? Just to be a pal. Hey, what's that i smell on you? Hair oil? I can't understand why a man of your talents wears them rags. Clothes are a lot of blinking excitement about nothing most of the time. As to what you call my rags, they are the uniform of my independence. Clothed in your perfect pitch. Now you understand me, mr. Mordinoy. Life's a piece of meat when you know how. Most people here are victims. Hurry, worry, and scurry to make a bit of brass. What's your kind, mr. Mordinoy? Willful and deceitful. Take what you want, right? Right. That's what it's about. Be a victim or a thug. But suppose you don't want to be neither, like me- not the heir and not the owned. Then what? Woman: Then what? Who's talking to you? Hey, who's the piece of pastry in the jersey? Ada brantlin. Fair blinds you with science, don't she? She don't like the rough stuff. Have to box clever there. Yes, i suppose you would. Change, please, miss. You're new here, aren't you? Who's this mordinoy? Run the place now, does he? Wouldn't dirty his hands on it. Then what's he doing here? The gentlemen come in to converse with me. Now kindly move on. How do i get in your good books, ada? There we are. Lovely fingernails. What's up? Don't you know when your health is good? Wished i was a painter. And you'd do what? Well, what does a painter do? In this book, a painter does some very strange things. Calls it art, too, he does. You an artist? Me? Tune pianos, that's me. Play the piano by ear, polish furniture, shoot rodents with a rifle. Bugs in your house? Send for ernie mott. Know how to medicate animals. Excellent at repairing delicate machinery. I invent inventions. What you invent? Uh, oh... i see. I happen to be working on my greatest invention- a human animal which don't look for a master. Ain't easy. Listen. Come closer. I like that kind of talk. You do? It sounds barmy as the muffin man, but i like it. That brings up one question, ada. What? What time do you get off? Half 6:00. Around the back. Thank you. Change, miss. Oy. Catch. Thank you, sir. Charitable sort, you are. Oh, that? Friend of mine. Knew him when. When what? When he was a man. Old ike webber, a friend of my ma's, told me this. "As i was out walking, "i saw in the distance what seemed an animal. "Come up closer and see it was a man. Come still closer and see it was my brother." Tired? Mm-hmm. Quiet as mice, ain't we? What you looking at? Tell us. Tired, ain't you? Always tired. My feet's just about wore off. Let's go. Nice strong cup of tea for two. What's the dog doing here? I don't go out with dogs, you know. All right. I'll drop him off on the way. Come on. Kissing you like that- the first meeting. I never done a thing like that before in my whole life. Lucky me. Lucky you. Well, now. Five red beetles on the end of your fingers. G sharp- the pitch of that. Perfect pitch, that's me. G sharp. Not one in a million has that. Very unusual person, didn't you know? Are you? Yes, and all i want to do is hold you and murder anyone who'd say a word to you. Interesting program, but what's it get me? Only trouble. Why don't you put that hat on? I don't want to spoil me hair. Meeting someone? It's late, later than i thought. Time is not of the essence with me. No place to go and going there tomorrow. I don't pretend to know what that means. Fight like cats with ma. Told her off today, so it's the end. She don't know they milk the cow that stands still. Wants me in that silly business of hers, squeezing pennies out of paupers. No, thank you. You mean you're leaving london in the morning? Can't think of any reason not to, can you? Inviting me in? No. My aunt and uncle's asleep in the back. I'd like to smash you one with this. Why? I feel like i know you a whole lifetime. Do you want to see me cry? No. Then say good-bye and go away. No sense in this. You're leaving in the morning. Just wasting our time, that's all. You're a stranger. We meet. Suddenly - have you ever been in love? You make me feel 12 years old again. I don't know why. You're the only man i've met in years who gives me any feeling. Say good-bye. That's the end. I'll drop by the funfair tomorrow. Don't. Good night, ada. Good-bye, ern boy. In the end, you wouldn't give me what i need. Confidence-that's what a woman needs. Confidence? Yes. Good thing then you won't see me again. No future in me for anyone like you. No confidence. Good night, ada. Good night. No question, mrs. Mott. It's worth every penny you ask, irregardless. I'll send mr. Lesser for it this afternoon. It goes in my private collection. I couldn't find the heart to sell it. Good enough, ike. If you can afford it. Would your son like to clean the mechanism? He's got talent for such things. I see your mind is somewhere else today. Still the same old trouble? He won't stay home. Proud as the queen's carriage he is and independent. He's leaving home for good today. Excuse me for mentioning it, but why don't i talk to him? You've got to help me, ike. But of course. Irregardless. I'm ill. What your wife up and died of. Oh. It might happen sooner than i think. Thinking out loud, it would be very fine if you had him with you for- for the next few months. You need sleep and special considerations. That's impossible with him walking around the country. Why don't you tell him? Oh, but, mrs. Mott, isn't it possible that maybe you exaggerate his feelings? I brought joey round again. What are them pills for? Yeast tablets. Don't think they do you any good, do you? At least as much as you do. See, that's what i mean. Never an hour of peace between us. Reckon the stork brought you the wrong sort of son. Wouldn't be surprised. You'll never get me to stay and run this shop. I won't sweat pennies out of devils poorer than meself, not if i had both legs cut off. I'd crawl out in the street. Someday you'll know i'm your only friend. Less said, the better. Eat your breakfast. Good-bye. Nipper. I'll drop you a post card from the seaside. Where you off to? Rehearsals. Had your breakfast? I'm going up to tate's. Tate's! I'm sick of this street. I've smelled it for almost 5 times 7 years. Quick, let a wind come and blow it all to pieces. Well, i'm leaving for good now. Miss me, will you? It's nothing to do with me if you quarrel with your ma. Yes, i'll miss you. Marry you quick if i had the chance. What about money? "Money talks," they say. The only thing it ever told me was good-bye. Support me, would you? If you wanted me to. Think you could handle me, aggie? I know how to handle you- not handle you at all, leave you be. I've never been so tempted in all me born days. Think about it. You know the address. Oh, i'm late. I've got to hurry. Good-bye, ernie. * the gray dawn is breaking * bye, aggie. * the horn of the hunter is heard ** nipper, you stay there. A big fourpenny, and two of chips. Looking very prosperous there, len, new fixtures and all. Yes, i got mine. Looks as if it's all in your teeth. Ain't it time you stayed home and settled down in business for yourself, son? Me? If that's what you happen to want. It's safe, that's what it is. Safe. Well, if it isn't ike webber. What brings you here? And how is mr. Mott today? What an honor, mr. Mott. Come down for some of tate's famous chips? Mm-hmm. Everything with a kiss. I'm glad i ran into you. Are you? I need 2 pounds' worth of clock repairs. I'm on me way to liverpool. Oh. Don't they use money in liverpool anymore? A gent! Ah, ancient history. "To edward from mary, with love." You know, ike, give me good old quiet machinery anytime. She wants a quid on this - an old lady. Give it to her, an old lady, mr. Lesser. Everything with a kiss. Clocks. Clocks. Tick tock. Tick tock. Tick tock. Did you ever realize your mother was, once upon a time, maybe the most beautiful woman in the east end of london? In the old days, i mean. What about it? Excuse me if i put a flea in your ear. Your mother is a very sick woman. You owe me ³2, ike. Pay it. I'll be on my way. Does she have a pain for her no-good son? Your mother is not a superficial woman, mr. Mott. When she gets ill, she gets ill. What is it? Cancer. I recommend you not to say a word to her. Everything with a kiss. What are you laughing about, son? Are you laughing? Huh? Thought i heard you laughing. Seems like i saw you before. Wasn't it the other night in westminster? What's your name, son? Ernie mott. As the bacon said to the egg, "so pleased to meet you." Henry twite's my name. Ernest verdun mott. That's mine, if you want it all. How did you come by a rare, old title like that? Me father- he rolled up there at verdun in the last war. A friend of mine put something in my ear, and i can't get it out. Buzz, buzz, buzz. Been drinking, have you? Lor lummey, you got it bad. I know all about trouble, i do. Son of my bosom, that's what you are. Son of your nothing. I'm a lone wolf, barking in a corner, plain disgusted with a world i never made and don't want none of. There's the river, boy. Help yourself. Don't like water neither, i see. Ah, that's different, that is. Sweating like that on a night like this, you'll catch your death of double ammonia. Come along with me to a place where it's warm and dry. Here we are, dad. Echo! Echo! Echo! I'll see you soon again. Echo! What for, dad? Maybe help you to get more adjusted to your environment. Now, wait. Why not help my environment get more adjusted to me? Follow that? Buzz, buzz, buzz. Verdun, you're drunk. You are. Oh, i am that, dad. Echo! Echo! Echo! * oh, starry night * * oh, starry night * * dee dee dee dee * * deedle-dee di ** oh, well. Say good night. See you soon. And me feet killing me. Good night, dad. Night, verdun. Echo, echo, echo. Buzz, buzz, buzz. Changed my mind. Home to stay. Less said, the better. Knock off that piping. Get up to ma tate's and get some grub. Spirit of the morning, ma. Here's you and here's me, in working order. Ta-ra chin! Ain't i lovely? Proper dream, you are. All blistered from weeks of work. I'm going to need some more green paint. Pick it up at pa prettyjohn's. Hey, where are you off to? I'm off to the whitechapel road to do a bit of business. Don't know how long i'll be. Take charge of the shop. See how you go. Makes me proud you think i can do that. Slosh you one. Ain't so long since i was washing out your baby napkins. Come on, nipper. Are you taking nipper? Why not? Cradled him, didn't i? Here, put that in your pocket. See how you like it. Right. Slosh you one. Oh, hello, ma. How's your poor old feet, ma? Old. Here. I think i'll hang her up in my room. What for? Reminds me of a person. Reminds me of a christmas goose. Here, take this with you. Hop it now, up to your room. What is it, ma? Sausage and mash for supper, so don't be late coming down. Ma. Makes me give at the knees, this surprise of yours. Glad you like it, son. Supper's nearly ready. Sit down and have your supper, son. Wish you'd walk past fish and chips, let that mrs. Tate see you, not to mention dear ma fadden and the plaster-haired alf. Ha ha ha! Surprise them all, won't i? Surprises me most. You look just like your father did... on his best days, that is. Did you love my old man? Expect you to do something for me tonight. What? Stroll around a bit with me. We'll see a film - the two and fourpenny seats. Don't you try any of them larks on me. I'm old enough to be your mother. Ha ha ha! Come on, ma. Do it. Couldn't do it, son. Why not? Too rich for my blood. Besides, sleep's a blessed thing. What's wrong, ma? Something hurt you? No. What gave you that idea? Got a funny story right on the tip of me tongue about a little man in the park. Isn't them yeast tablets up on the mantelpiece? Tummy ache. What about that funny story, son? Oh, yeah. Oh. This little man is in the park, see? That's peculiar. It slipped my mind now. Ache all gone? Nothing to it. Sausage ain't right for delicate appetites. Go on. You cook them a treat, ma. Worst cook in london town. Don't try buttering me up. If it's a pound you want, you'll find it up there under the vase. That's it, ma. Seen right through me, you did. Off you go then. Tomorrow's sunday, so it don't matter how late you come back. Don't wake me. Well, uh, well, i'm off, ma. Have a good time, boy. Thanks, ma. Hey, hey. Your hat's on crooked. Quiet as a little mouse. Listen, ernie. I'm sorry you've come back. Ow! Rolled an ice-cold pickle jar down my back, you did. You mean that, ada? You're not serious. I'm not an apple to take a bite of and throw away. I thought about it for 5 weeks whether or not to see you again. What are you looking at, ada? See a parade going by? Yes, maybe a whole bloomin' parade of troubles. You can't fight it out out here. There's places for such things. Best find one. Who's that? Me, mrs. Mott. Millie wilson. Alone, are you? You drunk? No. Give it up, i did. Give it up. Ma snowden sent me. She got herself half a dozen feather pillows, soft enough for aristocracy. Never slept on, neither. Where'd they come from? The usual place? Yes. You know i don't handle stolen goods, millie. She'd sell them cheap, she would. No. 3 or 4 fine woolen blankets, too. No. Quiet. Sorry, mrs. Mott. Now be a good boy, ernie, and say good night. What a way you have of making simple things difficult. Think so? Suppose a certain party doesn't happen to like me seeing you? Who would that be? Jim mordinoy. Mordinoy, the flash boy? How has he crept into your life? Didn't say he had, did i? There's about 20 good kisses left in me, but he'll never get one. Told him so? More than once. Then that's that. According to whose book? Ernie mott's. I'd blind him out of two eyes quick as see him. Here's hoping you don't try. , now, say good night, ernie, and let's forget it all. We all right for next wednesday night? Take me dancing? Anything you like, ada. Here's 5 beetles on it. Give over, boy. You'll mash me to a pulp. Wednesday, half 9:00, then. That's it. Okey-doke, aggie. It's a friend. Oh. What are you doing out this late at night? Bit of fresh air. Tall tonight. The high-heeled shoes. I've just finished playing at a club dinner. You know what they're like- a lot of men smoking cigars and getting tight and showing off. I get sick of it. I thought you'd forgotten me. No, not at all. Want some coffee? No, thanks, aggie. Are you a fortuneteller, aggie? Somewhat. I'm on the fringes of a great romance. What'll i do? Have it. But it's not you, aggie. That's no news, is it? I know you like it honest. Don't often meet a cavalier this late at night. But it ain't fair to you, these meetings. Oh, really, ern. You're a fool. You're moody; you're clever; you're human, but you're a fool. You're trying to tell me you love another girl, right? I know why you're staying. No, that isn't why, aggie. Well then, why? Me ma is ill. Last card in the pack, it looks. Oh. All roads lead to ma this year. What'd we start talking about? Nothing that won't keep. I'd better make a move. I get an idea she don't sleep every night. Mind the step. Wait a minute, ernie. Don't worry for me. I'm here if you need me. If i love you, it's something i can't help and something that i need. But people are what they are and love what they love, and i don't see any sense in trying to be something else. I wouldn't trade it for a box at the opera, the thing i feel for you. And you can't change it or take it away from me. There you are, mr. Jack-in-the-box. Now, cross over and sleep well. Hmm. You don't think it's worth more, ike? To my mind, no, mrs. Mott. All right. Hmm. Hmm. It adds up just under ³200, the piano not included. That's very disappointing. You expected it to be more? That's nothing. Go through his generous hands in a year. Look at him out there. Never know it was the same boy, would you? There's such things as prayers being answered. Yes, the places of the world are empty, and the human heart is everything. Oh, that's a speech. Well, i'll go. Thank you, ike. You're a sport. Anytime, mrs. Mott. A pleasure to serve you, irregardless. Whoa! Ah, me verdun boy! How are you? Fine. How's your ma? What have you got there? Selling fruit round the pubs. Doing a rare, old trade and all. That your ma playing peek-a-boo in there? Call her out. A person of me own generation. Ma, want you to meet a friend of mine. Henry twite. Asked how i was, did you? Been better, been worse. All right with you, me old china? Ain't bad, mr. Twite. Could be better. This is from your hopeful heir. Sent by a dutiful son who's looking after his ma while she's still here to be looked after. You buy these for me, son? Uh... Iooks like you made a hit there, son. Yeah, looks like i did. Thanks. Box of doll's eyes. Found them in a shipment. Hey, hey. Where are you off to? Stay for tea. No, no! Meet me any night at tiger's place. Give me a leg up. Can't dally with friendship when making a living's in the air. Ho-ho! I should say so. Come on. Lovely man, that. Ho-ho, i should say so. Never had anything like that give me. Some people don't even tune a piano for me when it's promised. Anyone so thoughtless ought to have their bottom spanked, ma. I'll be over in a minute. Just have to get me machinery. Nice man, that twite. Best of the best. Had a quiet sniff, did you? Let's change the subject or i'll howl, i will. Promised to tune ma chalmers' piano. Someone in the shop. Ha ha! What did do you with my millie wilson? Your millie wilson? You set the dog on her. You're as daft as she is. Come here, millie. Didn't she set the dog on you? Yes, she did. The white-him. Wish i had, that's what. That's your trouble, mother mott. Don't you "mother mott" me, jane snowden. I'll put you in the gutter if you raise your voice to me. I can see you don't realize what's involved. Not 3 or 4, but ³500, and just for selling stolen goods. What's the income of your shop compared with that? Shoplifting, that's plain. Save your breath. We do the lifting. You just do the selling. That's just like walking through an orchard picking apples. What's wrong about that? No bid. No bid, mrs. Snowden. You tire me out, you do. Well, i have nothing more to say. I shan't waste me time. "There's ma mott," i says. "Let her make enough "to live out her life in peace, "maybe leave a bit for her boy. Good old mother mott," i says. There's the gratitude, millie-called a thief. Something for the book, that's what it is. But i've got nothing more to say. But if you happen to change your mind, you know where i'll be. £500, i says. Not less. Like me, ernie? A bit. There are three reasons why i dislike dancing. One, i don't dance good enough. Two, it's too hot. And three, what's mordinoy doing here? He owns this place. What makes that tie the lamb's tail? Want to stop? Suits me. Now don't you think i know three's a crowd? He invited himself. It's not important. I can hardly keep my hands off him. Listen. 20 boys here would carve you up if he just said the word. Don't be so romantic, ernie. Save it for me. The evening's young. Sit down now, shall we? How about me, ada? Am i next? Let me rest. What do you think i'm made of? I'll find out one of these days. Kids himself something cruel. I love the way those saxes come out, sort of in kid gloves just loud enough to be heard. I wish i could live out my time like this. Perfect pitch don't hear a word you're saying. What's this stuff called? Ha ha! Ha ha ha! What's funny? I thought everybody over 16 knew what champagne was. I'll be 16 in march. You're well-developed for a boy. I don't want no quarrels here. Quarrels? Mott likes me, don't you, mott? Don't you like me? Why should i like you? Half a spoonful of lemonade and he's bandy-legged. I like your attitude, mott. It'll kill you or make you. By the way, ada, i bought the funfair today. Ada. I've been waiting years for this. How about a turn or two? I'm sorry, mr. Mordinoy. Mr. Mordinoy don't mind, sid. How's your ma doing in that shop of hers? Who told you about that? Oh, it interested me to find out. Why? You're a cut above the usual article that floats around. Only a cut? There's that attitude again. Ada is interested in you, it seems. Nothing special. And i'm interested in ada, very special. I'm going to do something for you, mott. Like to stuff your pockets? You know where ermington street is? Tattamy's garage? I'm there any morning. You've got talent and imagination. Work hard for me, and you'll start at ³50 a week. Breaking whose neck? Don't you think you're being rude? I've been after ada too long to lose her. She knows it. Now you know it. She won't wear you, seems like. Ada was always a bit giddy. I recall a couple of weekends at brighton. We shared adjoining rooms. Now, look here. What's the matter? What are you interrupting me for? I remember it used to give me a special sort of pleasure to choose her clothes. Wait a minute! You're young and excitable, mott. Sit down. Ada is mrs. Mordinoy. Ernie. Ernie! Wait a minute. Ha ha ha! Mrs. Mordinoy. Used to be me name. What do you want? Me life history in the flesh? It's a family quarrel. It isn't. Be two years next month we're divorced. Won't wash, ada, ducks. What won't wash? Less said, the better. Quick's the word, then. There's the door. Morning, ma. Morning, son. What happened to you last night? Hit by a train. Head-on collision. Oh, my, sheep's heart again? Are we that poor to be eating the insides of sheep day in, day out? Millions worse off, son. Poor putrid millions. What's the price of this one? Percy floom and flo looking over wedding stuff on his day off. Make a lovely match, they will. Yes. To start a fire. Proper case, ain't she? Nice sensible head on her, for all that. He'll have a happy life. Blinking idiots, the pair of them. Getting married. I'd like to see a nipper or two of yours before i get took off. Shan't be here always, you know. You'll have this shop for your own. You're all fixed up for a home. Why don't you look around? Had too many looks around. What an ugly, insanitary life it is. Needn't be. But it is. Lots of love in you, ernie. Wants an object, something to lavish it on. What's wrong with you, ma? You're an object. For keat, please. Which book, nipper? Boot club. Boot club? Boots, boots, boots. Saving for boots? Yes, sir, mr. Mott. That makes two and thruppence so far, right? How long's it take to save for the boots? 27 weeks, sir. Your ma goes three and a tanner on him! I can't pay you more than what the book says. Take it or leave it! Sorry. Throwing me out, are you? No. I can't give you more than half a crown. Well, i'll take it. I'll tell your ma on you. You wait. No matter to you what we has to go through, does it? Here's your money. Joey? Hey, lovey? Speak to your mum. Speak to her, boy. Here. You reckon he's all right, do you, ern? Here. Here, old girl. Here, old girl. Take half a crown. Here's joey. What's up now? Pinched something, has she? Peace! That's what i'm looking for! I want peace with happy hearts and straight bones without dirt and distress. Surprises you, don't it? Peace! That's what us millions want, without having to snatch it from the smaller dogs. Peace to be not a hound and not a hare, but peace with pride, to have a decent human life... with all the trimmings. Won't find nothing like that in this world, not in our time, son. No way to beat it. There's a way. Travel with the hounds. Where are you off to? A walk around. Nipper. Leave nipper here. Right. Open it. I don't want no more trouble in my life. I've had a big packet of it in my time. No more, ern. Not from you and not from jim. I'm leaving there as soon as i find another job. I was feeling as if i'd just started living. Were you? I ought to hate you, didn't i? But i don't. Want to come in half a minute? Want me to? There's something i'd like you to see. Very mysterious, the room of the girl you love. Yours? Yes. That's my kiddy. That's the little girl of all my dreams. What a wallop you give me, ada. Put your face up half a mo. Put your arms around me. Aren't you happy to see me? Yes. You make me very happy, but i have to tell you i'm thinking of going in with mordinoy. I want money. I don't know how to get it sooner. Really, i'm sorry. I'm sorry i ever see you. You'll do time. He'll see you will, jim will. I'm sorry i ever see you. My eye, what a girl. Don't she ever get tired of saying good-bye? That's right. Wake my kiddy. Sorry. You got any sense in you? I could murder you myself. What would you want me for? Be your girl, your wife, and next week be poking you bananas through the bars? I see your point. I'll never let you go. You don't touch me ever again! Ada, don't die on me. What can i lose if i do a job for him? Me. Do you hear that? Me. The world i want can be as small as this room, but i have to know it's here tomorrow, too. Yes. I'm as old-fashioned as sealing wax. I believe every girl should be married, but it wants a solid base, not policemen and being slashed about. Tile baths, silks, and jewels- that's why i left him. I'll only start crying, so give over now. Say good-bye. I'll say good night. Good night, ada. Where you going, happy face? Here to see mr. Mordinoy. Oh. Oh, jim, a customer here! This is the lad i was telling you about. Ernie, this is slush yatley. How's she go, ernie boy? Cosh simmons. He never shakes hands. Is ernie a buyer, jim, or joining the riding academy? Joining the academy. He'll learn from you, i hope, or maybe teach you something. You can never tell with mott. Then 7:00 tomorrow morning, ernie boy. We don't keep gentlemen's hours here. Okey-doke. Come on and see what's going on here. How's ada? Don't see her too often, mr. Mordinoy. This way, mott. But nothing won't never take the place of ice. I would say the same, ma. Well, i've never seen nothing to beat this. Never on land or sea. Makes its own ice. Why, that's magic. Money belongs in the bank. In the bank, that's where you want it. Sticking it on the wall won't get you nowhere. You'll catch it, my lad, if you go buying me any presents. Ha! Come on, son. Good evening, mrs. Mott. Ha! Jealous. She's jealous. Clara tate's a copyrighted nuisance. Just the smell of her is a meal. Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! How's my daughter? Splitting headache. Go out and sit with ike. I'll bring you a glass of stout. Where's nipper? Put upstairs for the night. Happy, ma? Where'd the money come from bought all this? Money? Where does money come from, ma? You earn it, steal it, find it. Find yours under a tree? That's it, ma. Hope you won't find any more, son. Working for jim now, ain't you? You were down at the club last night... doing what? Can i trust you now? Do you want me to shout? Oh, bash me one. Get it over with. Bash me proper so i don't never wake up again. I don't know what we're in for, you and me. Don't you see i love you? You can't eat your cake and have it, too. Me or him. If it's me, we go away. Why go away? He watched me from the balcony office all afternoon. Called me in at suppertime, yelling like 1:00. I never seen him like that before - jealous. I owe your kiddy a toy. What about him? He eats a few raisins and has us done away with. Oh, ada, quiet down. You talk so wild. I won't be wild far away. The sooner we went, the better. I'd have my kiddy. You'd have me. Ada girl, rome wasn't built in a day. It's yes or no, ernie mott. No two ways about it. What worries you? My kiddy? I can leave her with my aunt. No. It's not your kiddy, ada. It's my ma. She's been took queer. She's very ill. I couldn't leave her. That's the end, then. No. Give me time to use my brain! What's the use? Ada... look. It's my birthday tonight. Just give me a bit of time for a gift. See me home, then. I'm freezing here. All right. Just give me time to think. Don't be afraid. He'll want three cars, cosh boy. Done. Where's mott, jim? Where is mott? Did i miss anything? Buy yourself an alarm clock. Cosh likes everything in order. Punctuality is the essence of our business. It's skins tonight. Selnic's fur shop in the brompton road. Meet me here at 6:00. Okey-doke. Stroll up and have a look in daylight. Okey-doke. Something in your eye, mott? What? Something you wanted to say? Me? No, not a thing, at the moment. Oh, cigarette? Never smoke in the afternoon. Thank you. Present from me ma. Platinum. Silver, she said. Platinum. Your ma knows what's what. As a matter of fact, something i did want to say. A friend of mine's in trouble. Copper? Girl. He loves a girl, and she loves him. All happy, then. No. That's the trouble. A third party there, acting like a dog in the manger. The girl don't like him, but he's a big boy. He's promised to make enough trouble for my friend to start a business. What's your friend's name? Name of ernie. Oh, like you. What's the big boy's name? Name of jim, like you. If your friend's as good-looking as you, what's he want to get married for? Waste of time, ain't it? Jim. What's up, taz? I pawned a ruby ring. The police took it. Why? Stolen property, they said. And is it? My married sister give it to me. The old lark. It's been worked before. Warm up a car. Get cosh. Thanks. That's grand. Can't treat the family like that. We'll have to go there and show them. Don't figure you want me to go along? Ain't you one of the family anymore? Now then, what's the matter? What's your game, you slimy stink? What did i do? Where's my friend's ruby ring? Here's the ticket. Here's the money. Now, go and get it. Oh, the ring. I give you my oath, the police took it. My mr. Lesser told you the truth. The ring was stolen property. You're a dirty, conniving, ignorant crook. Nip over the back, taz. You, too, cosh. Have a look around. Go with them, mott. Mott, don't take all day. Come on, take it, take it! Here you are. My fee for coming. Cor! Look at these beautiful watch chains. Locked. The key's what's needed here. See anything of my ring yet, mott? Hmm. No, i don't. I wish my brother was here. He's missing all the fun! Had to wallop the old bloke. Here it is. Ask me brother. The very one me sister give me. Lucky boy found his ring. Come in very handy for the sunday collection. Let's go. He found it, jim. Yes? Let's see. The very one me married sister give me. Your married sister's got her taste, taz boy. Listen. Didn't you say the ring was gone? The boy lies. Now, stop that stupidity and leave my shop. Uh. One's still standing. What do we do with him? I'll show you. My brother's missing all this. Watch this, mott. Style's everything. Old cosh will learn you, won't you, cosh? Someone's in line to get his head tore off! Now, who wants it next? Stay where you are, cosh. Let's get out of here. Listen, yikyak. Open your mouth, and i'll fix you right and your families, too. See? What happened in there, mott? Turned your stomach, did it? Think how you'd feel if it was your friend's girl. Washing your hands again? 10th time you've done it tonight. Going for a stroll? Might. Why? Wish you'd post this for me to ike webber. Ike? Don't forget, now. I want him to price a lovely antique piece for me. I shan't forget, ma. Don't know who that could be. Come in. You're in trouble, son. Mordinoy's right-hand man is after you. Mossbanks heard it down at tiger collis' place. Some sort of a plan to slash you about, you and some girl. Who's the girl? Name of brantlin. Ada brantlin. Can't say i know the name. Former mrs. Mordinoy. Stone the crystal. Uh. Tell you what, dad. You wait at the tunnel. Just half a mo. Friend of mine. Needs some advice on treating his dog's ears. Be home late? Can't say, ma. So long. Ernie, take nipper with you. Bye, ma. Oy. Out of tune. Agonizing. Jim would like to see you and miss brantlin up in his office. Who else is up there? We're going to the lucky seven club. Expect trouble with bert mark's boys. Don't forget jim. Almost slipped my mind. Count you as a sensible boy. Be careful. Wait around the back, dad. Won't be too long. Very aggranoying thing-love. Come in. I think you asked to see me, mordinoy. Fascinating symbols. You can't beat a machine. How's the girl, battler? Been trying to make this girl nervous for years. Nigh on impossible, seems. I don't want to sit down. Why would you want to make her nervous? I'm a machine. I ain't human. You can't beat me. Believe in astrology, mott? No. Neither do i, but in 1912, the titanic sank. Me father was on her. An old lady told him it would sink. Claimed she read it in the stars. Coming back to you, i'll sink you worse than any titanic if you don't stop seeing ada. See that in the stars? I seen it in me mirror. An old lady told me something once. Know some funny stories, tell them to yourself. What about ada? What about her? The holiday is over... for both of you. I don't want you two meeting again, see? That's the way. Appeal to me. I might be persuaded. I'm a reasonable man. Hello. Well, don't raise the dust, rossie. I'll be down in 20 minutes. You understand me, don't you? Go to the films if you're looking for love. Personally, i don't believe in it. What do you believe in? Nothing. Simple, ain't it? Nothing in the whole, wide world. And don't appeal to me. I won't be persuaded. First thing in the morning, we're taking out the marriage license. Are we? I wonder what the weatherman promises for tomorrow. Likely rain, followed by suicide in bed. Let's get out of here. Dad? Verdun. Nothing stirring out here, not a mouse. Dad, i'd like you to meet the future mrs. Ernest verdun mott. So this is the future mrs. E.v. M? Well, stone the crystal palace. I'm for it. Stay right here. It wants a cab. I should say so. Don't be nervous, beetles. Up to your knees in dreams, aren't you? We're starting off tomorrow with 5 or 6 pounds and a sunny personality. Are we? And supposing i went off with jim? What a thing to say. Supposing i flew off to the north pole. I don't know what i'm saying anymore. Ernie, dear, why don't we go away somewhere, just the two of us? Please. Verdun. Right, dad. Ernie, please. Couldn't do it, ada. Get in there, nipper. Now, you go with ada. Nothing will harm you while the dog's with you. Dad, go with her, too. Pleasure. Where are you off to? To say something to mordinoy couldn't be said in front of ladies. Every time you kiss me, it gets deeper. Does it? See you in the morning. How many cartridges did you want? 8 or 10 will be enough. Lend us your newspaper. Yeah. Careful going out. Leave it to me. Oh, mott. Ah, the brothers jones. Good evening. No offense about anything, i hope. Nice car. Steal it? Picked it up on newman street. We're on our way down to the club. Uh-huh. Meeting jim down there? Yes. Bags of sport there tonight. I'm in the mood for sport tonight. Don't you want to sit in the front? I'll be more comfortable back here. Been a long day, ain't it? That's just what i was thinking. Watch the red light, taz. Coppers up, taz. Right behind us. You're crazy. He's right. It's a police car. Taz, don't spare the horses. I'll lose them inside five minutes. The tunnel's coming. Pull over. Me foot's flat on the floor. Stop immediately. This is a police car. You ain't lost them, taz. I'll wear my granny's hat if i can't. We're gaining, taz. They're too heavy. We'll do it. You done them proper stone cold. They always lose in the stretch. I've noticed it before. Blimey! Get the rear door open. Here, you. You hurt? Come on out. I want all of you. I got him. Hold on to him! Get me brother out. He's hurt. Come on, step lively. Step lively. Get me brother out. He's in there! He's hurt! Get me brother out! He's in there! He's hurt! Get me brother! Look out for the petrol. The tank's on fire! Get back! Get him out! Please let me get him! Let me get him! Please! Let me get him! Quiet, knockers! Please! Sorry. Somebody had to do that. Come on. Bring him along. E flat. Well, what have we here? None of your cheap, nasty silver or gold, eh? Platinum... just a bare platinum. You still wouldn't care to say a word or two, either of you? A little post card... not posted. Addressed to i. Webber, esquire. Well, we'll soon find out who you are, my lad. Lucas, ring up mr. Webber. I'll talk to him. Yes, sir. Ike, paid the bail, did you? I shan't forget you, nor will ma. Everything with a kiss. How's mr. Lesser? In the hospital. I stood your bail for ³100. You'll have to be at bow street in the court day after tomorrow, 9:15. Listen, mr. Mott, you're frying yourself in your own fat. You realize that? You'll need a few quid for incidentals. One's enough. Thanks again. And no matter what anyone says, your mother is a wonderful woman. No sign of him yet? No. Who's going to tell him? Me or you? Don't know. Stale as an old debt, they are. Try these, then. They're just as worse. My eyes tell me. Me whole stock ain't stale, is it? Daresay it is. Here he is now! Ern! Ernie! Come in, son! Come in. What's this? A gathering of the clans? Nipper. Where you been all night? Why? Ma worried about me? Been in a right stew about you, all of us. Friend of yours dropped in. I don't know why. Eating through me stock like a flock of mice on wheels. Off with your wet coat. Just brought the dog back to you, verdun. Your ma's gone out for a bit. Where have you been, ern? Oh, just seeing how the other half lives. Where'd she go? Nice egg and sausage left over, if you care to take it. Where did ma go, aggie? Where is she? Sit down, son. Put your feet up. What happened? What happened? Well, i'm in bed, and a... and a what? Copper comes along and gets me out to go down to your house with him. Down i goes, and there's a dozen of them. Dozen who? Coppers. Your ma's just sitting there, letting them have the run of the house. She can't explain your cigarette case, where it's from. Then they find some other stuff. What stuff? Stuff dragged out of cupboards. What about ma? Your ma told me to tell you, don't worry, see? "Don't worry, see"? Yes, but where is she? They took her in with mrs. Snowden and the others. Poor girls. Done me nails four times today. Biggest shoplifting gang this side of the river, a copper said. They got her inside, you mean? Pinched? Ah, life is a queer companion. There's a smell to these sort of places, an official sort of smell. Follow him. He'll take you down there. You've got 10 minutes. Be here when you come back, verdun boy. Hey, what's this? Why, your old girl's in the hospital here. She is? The sister will tell you everything, i expect. How much time do they give her? It might be tonight. It might be a week. Mrs. Mott? Here's your son to see you. Just 10 minutes, and you mustn't upset yourself. How's me daughter? Hello, ernie. Where you come from? Just thought i'd pop in, have a look at you. Raining out? Wet as water. See ike this morning? Yes. What i can't understand, ma, is what are you in here for? What's the matter with you? Tired out. Machinery run down, you know. If you get into any trouble, see ike. Been a good friend to me. Well, don't be in here long, ma. I'm going to get married, remember? That's right. Find a nice girl to look after you, a good girl. Yes, ma. Something steady... nothing cheap. With a head on her shoulders. Love me, son? Disgraced you. Disgraced me, ma? No, ma. Didn't disgrace me. I'm your son ernie mott, the boy who needs, loves, wants you. Outside now. I'll be back tomorrow, ma. Be quiet and get a good night's sleep. I see in the paper that a man in putney has a dog that brings home a tennis ball each day. I wonder where he gets it. What are you thinking, verdun boy? I'd best be off to ada's. She's expecting me, and she'll be worried. Got a nice toy for her kiddy here. She gave me that to give to you last night, ada did. Read it, dad. "Dear ernie mott, "i just couldn't face it. "For your sake and mine, i'm going back with jim." "The only other choice "is to make our bed in the river, "and that is something i could not face. "I tried to do different, "but it's best this way all around. "I hope and pray "you will forgive and forget, ernie mott. "Sincerely, ada brantlin. P.s. Please excuse paper." Stand back. Let the man see the rabbit. Ah. Stopped raining. What are you thinking, verdun boy? I'm dreaming, dad. Dreaming the better man. , what a go. What a rum go it is. Where's that clean human life the books tell us about? When's the world coming out of its midnight? When does the human soul get off its knees? I'm too old, verdun, to tell you that. Something shuddering in the air these days. Ever notice it, son? Yes, i have, dad. Sometimes late at night i hear it- a shuddering echo. And i hear it say, "wake up. The world needs happiness." Well, the world finds something if it needs it bad enough, but sometimes it takes a war. So if there's a better world to be made, you young ones will have to make it. That's it, dad. One thing's left. I can see it plain as london town. Fight with the men who will fight for a human way of life. I should say so. Me feet are killing me. Well, here's where i leave you. Leave me? You'll never leave me, you lopsided old muggins. Well, see you sooner. How sooner? Who knows? It's all written in the book. Right, dad.
