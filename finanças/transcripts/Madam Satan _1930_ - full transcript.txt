[bird chirping] Oh, Barbican, did you have a beautiful bath! Oh, Maggie, for the main course of dinner tonight we'll have a fillet, some potato souffl√© and broccoli. But you never eat broccoli, madam. No, I know I don't, Maggie. But Mr. Brooks is very fond of it. Come on. There's the little fellow. Come on. Oh, Thomas. Thomas, there'll be three ladies from the Welfare League this afternoon for tea, at 4 o'clock. Very good, madam. There you. Oh, Brown. Brown, I found that powder puff, in Mr. Brooks room. How do you explain it? I use it for polishing the nickel. - May I have it, madam? - No. I suggest that you buy yourself a chamois. Yes, madam. Come on, sweet. Now, I'll put him out in the beautiful sunshine. There you. There you are. Madam, you didn't take your exercises this morning. Oh, I know I didn't, Martha. Martha, is it worthwhile for a wife to break her back to please her husband? It's impossible to please a husband, madam. Hmm. I'm beginning to think so. Oh, uh...Mr. Brooks didn't return last night, Martha. He's away on business. Yes, madam. Say, just a minute, old man. This is my door. Wait a minute. Say, you're so stingy, you wouldn't share it with a pal. Why, of course, I will. But it's no good while it's shut. Let's open it. Huh? And then, you can have half of it. Oh, thanks so much, sir. * Heaven forgive thee kindly * * But my life aren't worth a song * * Why thy pleasure to deceive me * [humming] [piano music] [music continues] Oh, I just didn't want to make noise, but I don't care. [music continues] Pardon me, madam. 'Mr. Brooks has just returned from his business trip.' Thank you, Martha. Perhaps, you'd better read this, first. Why, Martha! Why, Martha. I was in bed at 10 o'clock. That's what I thought, madam. Hmm. * Oh, it ain't gonna rain anymore no more * * It ain't gonna rain no more * * So how in the juice can I cook my goose * * If it ain't gonna rain no more * * Oh, it ain't gonna rain no more no more * * It ain't gonna rain no more * * So how's that I use my tears to wash your ears * * If it ain't gonna rain no more * * Oh, it ain't gonna rain no more no more * * It ain't gonna rain no more * * So how in the juice can I cook my goose * * 'Cause it ain't gonna rain no more * Stopped raining. Ha! Didn't I tell you it would? There, the tree is here and the.. - Eh, good morning, darling. - Good morning, dear. - Hello, Jimmy. - Oh, hello. Did you enjoy yourself last night? Oh, no. No, darling. No, as a matter of fact, I had a terrible time with some out-of-town business men. - Business? - Oh, yes. You know me, darling. I eat business, and I sleep business and-- - Drink business. - Yes.. I hope the business went well. Well? [laughs] You don't know the half of it. Huh? [laughs] No, I'm sure I don't. Huh? Well.. You two look as though you needed some sleep. I'll go turn down the bed. - Red, like her head. - No, she doesn't even suspect. She's too sweet to call your bluff. You're right. She is too sweet. You know, I wish she'd throw something at me. Yeah? So do I. (Jimmy) 'Why don't you get pajamas that fit me?' Why, if you want to get any-- Come on, you two. - I'll tuck you in. - Thank you, darling. - Oh, there's the morning paper. - Hmm, any news? No, nothing important. Just that you're a bigamist. What? - Hey, now, what does it say? - Now, just a minute. Ha ha. Yellow journalism. Absolutely. You know, there should be a law, against putting things like this in the paper. But, uh, Mrs. Brooks, who is she? Huh? She...couldn't have been you, could it, eh? No, indeed, no, it...wasn't you. I know she wasn't. Who was she? - Well.. - Who indeed? - You guess. - You were there, Jimmy. Oh, yes. Mm-hmm, yes. Jimmy was there. She wasn't your wife, Bob. Whose wife was she? Oh, she.. ...she was Jimmy's wife. Jimmy, huh? Why, Jimmy's not married. [laughs] Isn't that silly, Jimmy? She didn't know you were married. When did you, uh, when did you get married, Jimmy? Oh, suddenly. Very very suddenly. Darling, why didn't you tell me that Jimmy was married? Ha ha ha. I haven't known it very long, myself. Well, he's keeping as a secret. Oh, yes. You see, marriage is sacred to Jimmy. I'm glad it is to somebody. Mm-hmm. He didn't want a soul to know. That is, except himself and the girl. And they never speak of it. - A real romance. - Oh, most romantic. Hmm. They're on their honeymoon now. Are they? Where? A-a-at the Royal Arms. Ouch. Eh, huh. Oh, yes. Yes, that's right. In...in his wife's arms. Where every honeymooner ought to be. Yes. Home is where the heart is, I always...say. I do want to meet her, Jimmy. What's her name? H-H...Her name is, uh... her name is the same as mine. I mean her maiden name. Oh, she hasn't been a maiden for a long time. What's her first name? Her first name? Her first.. Her first name? Oh...her first name is... is really Trixie. - Yeah. Huh? - Huh. Trixie? How perfectly sweet. - Yes. - Hmm. - Where does she come from? - Oh, from.. (both men) Down South. North. - No, South. - North, South. Darling, listen. Oh, from way down South, in...North Carolina. Yes, you know what the Governor of North Carolina said to the Governor of South Carolina, huh? Well, she's descended from both of them. - Must bring her to call soon. - Oh.. Yes. Very beautiful to think of someone being happily married. Well...I fixed that. And how? Don't blame me. Blame my wife. - She's so darn suspicious. - She has a right to be. I don't see how you can run around with a jane like Trixie when you've got a wife like that. Trixie is not a jane. She's a...a counter-irritant. Yes. Well, you've got no business marrying me off to your counter-irritant. You don't understand. I'm a romantic guy. I crave warm affection. And all I get is frozen justice. * One little lie * * And by and by you'll slip a little bit further down * * It's easy to fall * - What time is it now, Martha? - It's 9:30, madam. Well, I thought I might as well tear these tickets up. Concert began an hour ago. 'It is a shame, madam. I know how men are.' Do you, Martha? How are they? Terrible. Oh. He just doesn't care, Martha. I'm beaten. I admit it. Don't say that, madam. Every woman has to fight to rule her man. You must make yourself so attractive to him he won't want to leave you. You can. - You think so, Martha? - Of course. Life...is just what we make it. Merry or sad. [Martha singing "Live And Love Today"] [singing] [singing continues] [singing continues] [singing continues] You know, Martha? That's a very dangerous philosophy. It might be...Satan's job. True love...oh, true love is believing that the one you love is quite above defeat. New love...may come deceiving. But like a seed perhaps, will meet defeat. Storms come... and we must face them. Hello, darling. Alright, Martha. - Well, and what do you know? - Nothing. Nothing, except that you wasted this beautiful day, sleeping. You know, Bob, I've been waiting for you for two hours. Oh, please darling. Don't scold. - The concert began an hour ago. - Concert? What concert? Of course you forgot. Always forgetting me. - Angela. - Oh, Bob. I married you, loving you. But the moment we were married, you ceased to be my pal and became just my wife. Oh, Bob. We can't go on forever, playing like a couple of kids. Well, why not? Oh, come on, dear, let's forget it. We'll go to the concert, and be improved. No. No, you don't want to go, and so I'm not going. Oh, uh...give those to Jimmy's wife. Huh? Oh. Honestly, darling. I am sorry. What good does it do to be sorry? Well, I-I thought it might help. Day after day goes by and it's always the same old thing. You don't care whether I live or die. Angela, you're not sick or anything, are you? Yes, I am, Bob. I'm sick and tired. Well, I went to a concert with you, once. Slept all through it. There wasn't a saxophone in the orchestra. Oh, Bob, how can you be so flippant? And how can you be so serious? Oh, come along, darling. Don't let's waste the whole evening. I know, we'll go to the Follies. Hmm? The last place I feel like going. Oh, very well. You can go to the Metropolitan Museum with Jimmy. And I'll go back to the office, and attend to business. I'm your business, Bob. And you neglect it. And you neglect me. You're more interested in friendless girls than you are in a friendless husband. - Oh, Bob. - Well.. I know some friendless girls, too. That settles it. I've made up my mind. Alright. If you insist upon making a scene. I'm not making any scene, Bob. I'm not even angry with you. I've just decided to leave. - Coldly and logically. - Yes, that's you all over. - Cold logic. - You hate me, don't you? Oh, of course, I don't hate you, darling. As a matter of fact, I think you're above all other women. But, below zero. Oh, Bob. What a child you are. Of course, I am. All men are children. They like to play, and chase toy balloons. Alright, Bob. I'll leave you to chase your toy balloons. But when you catch one.. ...you'll find that it just goes up in smoke. Angela. If one of us has to leave, I'm going to be that one. Oh, God. That's what you've been aching to do. No, I haven't. Don't you understand? Love can't be kept in cold storage. It's a battery, that has to be recharged, every day. I've tried to be your lover, as well as your husband. Yes, but, you don't know what love means. You don't know what marriage means. Oh, yes I do. It's a school room and you're the teacher. Well, I've graduated. Oh, Bob. Oh, Bob. Bob.. Oh, Bob...Bob...Bob, please don't go, please don't go. Oh, Bob. [door closes] - Oh, sorry about-- - Jimmy. I didn't see you there. Lovely evening, isn't it? Jimmy, something terrible has happened. Oh, yes, I felt sure it was going to. - Bob has gone out. - By the door or the window? Oh, Jimmy, you don't think that he'd go to some other woman, do you? What, Bob? Oh, ridiculous, why? He'll come back and you'll be just as happy as-- - You and your wife? - Eh, well. I must be going. Jimmy, Jimmy. Oh, Jimmy. - What? - Jimmy. - Will you do something for me? - Certainly. Just tonight, will you let me come and let me stay with you and your wife? - I beg your pardon. - You said you were my friend. Oh, I-I am your friend, and my wife's your friend and my children are, my children will be your friends and we'll.. ...we'll all see you some other time. Oh, say, Jimmy. Jimmy, I'm coming with you, now. Oh, Angela. My wife's bashful, she'd scream if you'll say boo. - Oh, I wouldn't say boo to her. - No, wouldn't you? You don't understand. She telephoned me that she's got a terrible headache and she's sitting there all wrapped up in hot towels and-- Now, that's just what I need. We'll both sit in hot towels and talk. Angela, it would make you very unhappy to see my home right now. It really would. Oh, Jimmy. Oh, Jimmy, I need help. I need it advice. Do you? I'll solve it, sit down here. - Now, you give Bob a message. - Yes. Get out and make a little whoopee on your own account. I know...come to a masked ball I'm giving on the zeppelin? - Huh. No one will know you. - I've never made whoopee. No? Well...come as an angel, you'll be the only one there. I'll talk all that over with your wife, tonight. - I'll have her call, tomorrow. - No, I'm coming tonight. Fine, I'll call for you in the morning. I'll call for you in the morning. No, I'm coming with you tonight. [Martha singing "Live And Love Today"] [singing continues] Martha! - Martha. - 'Yes, madam.' Martha, get my bag, quickly. It's on on the foot of my bed. Oh, hurry, Martha. "She who hesitates, will fall by the way." "She who stops and waits, will watch with dismay." Here it is, ma'am. But, where are you going? I'm going to follow your song, Martha. I'm going to fight for my happiness. [Bob and Jimmy humming, "Low Down" by Lillian Roth] * Da da da da * * Dum dee dee dum * * Low Down Low Down * * Da da dee dee dum * Hey, you two. Pipe down! I can't think with all that row. Can you without it? Well, I couldn't, you two hands wouldn't be on the big time. Now, can the chatter, Trixie. Well, we get this act whipped, we can return to the coast room. Nothing doing. I got a swell reason for staying right here. What's the matter? Is Papa too weak to travel? No, but his wife's too strong to let him. 'Married, huh?' He has a wife that doesn't understand him. 'Oh, sure. So have I.' Oh, come on, let's do the number. Okay, but make it snappy, 'cause sweet papa's coming too. Where's the audience? - Out there. - Let's go. * Da dee dum dum doo * [Trixie singing "Low Down" by Lillian Roth] [singing continues] [singing continues] [singing continues] [singing "Low Down"] [singing continues] [singing continues] [singing continues] Gee, that was great, Trixie. You're not gonna let this new papa break up our act, are you? Say, how many weeks would it take to pay for that? - Many weeks in the world. - There is a Santa Claus. [door knocks] And there he is. Let him in, Biff. [knocking continues] Trixie. Trixie, I gotta see you for a minute. It's a matter of life and death. Oh, don't tell me Bob is gone and died. No, not that, but.. The door was open, so I just came in. I didn't think you'd mind. No...just surprised the little...bride. The little what? [chuckling] - So you're Trixie? - Nothing else but. I shouldn't think that would be good for headache. This, oh, yeah... doctor's orders. She has to sleep on the piano on account of the vibration. - Am I right, darling? - Say, lis.. You go back to nutty crest and send me a wire. - Who's the dame? - Of course, you don't know me. I'm Bob Brook's wife. She couldn't wait to see you. She's so surprised, at our being married. Our being wha.. [chuckling] - Isn't she cute? - She certainly is. Well, I'll leave the door open so that firemen can get in. See you in the funny papers. Oh, my. My, I'm so glad I came. I knew I wasn't making a mistake. - Oh...have a drink. - Thanks, honey. Angela doesn't drink. She's...she's like you. Don't look so worried on my account, Jimmy. It'll be alright. You see.. ...my husband and I, had a slight misunderstanding over.. ...trifle. Say, Lis-sten. Oh, my. What a sweet place. One just feels love in the air. I'll...I'll open the window. Give it to me. [chuckles] Nice picture of my husband, isn't it? When did he give you this, Jimmy? When we were in college. How little he's changed. But the inscription shows a certain amount of youthful enthusiasm. "To a dear little pal, with love." [clears throat] Well, I tell you, you see...Bob gave that to a niece of mine. Neily. Mm-hmm. And, she had a picture, so she lent it to me-- Remember, pet, we have to be up at seven tomorrow morning. Right, darling. I'll take Angela home now. Oh, but I'd like to stay here tonight, if you let me. Here, where I find, all that I miss at home. Oh-h-h. How long is this going on? Until your death do us part. I can sleep right here in this, sweet little guest room. It's not a guest room. It's, uh.. It's mine. Eh, you can't sleep in that room, it's very noisy. And there's a cat in the alley. No cat can disturb me. Just bring my bag in, will you, Jimmy? I could kill you. Run, darling, say goodnight to Angela. - Oh! - Have mercy. Your husband doesn't mind loaning me his room, does he? Oh, no. Angela, Bob will be terribly worried-- No. No, I don't think so. Probably with that woman. Have you any idea, who she is? Yes, I think I have. Oh, now, Angela, don't be rash. Supposing you were mistaken. That'll be just too bad. Wouldn't it? Oh, yes. Heh heh. - Well, goodnight. - Goodnight. - Come on, Jimmy darling. - Yeah. Oh, um.. It was dear of you to take me in. I'll do the same for you someday. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. [sighing] Say, what's the big idea of letting that dame park herself in my flat? What do you mean by it? What do you mean by what do I mean? - Boasting you're my husband. - Boast? It's a complaint. Say, you worm. Get out of my room. I wouldn't marry you to keep warm on an ice berg but we've got to pretend. Ohhh, married are we? Ha ha. Alright, let's pretend. I'll show you the first thing I'd do.. [knocking on door] (Angela) 'Yoo-hoo!' What did you say, pet? - 'May I come in?' - Yes, come in. - Papa reducing Momma? - Yes. - That's what I'm trying to do. - Are you? (Jimmy) 'Dear, little woman.' (Trixie) 'Sweet little boy.' Here, I thought you'd need your pajamas and dressing gown. Oh, thanks. Why, Jimmy you haven't started to undress. - Oh, I was just going to. - Oh. Oh, I really have inconvenienced you now, haven't I? - No, not at all. - Well. Well, I'm just not gonna leave until I know that you two turtle doves are comfy. [chuckling] Go ahead and undress, Jimmy. [humming] Well...goodnight. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Goodnight. Oh...if I get nervous during the night I'll come back and talk to you. 'You won't mind, will you?' - Oh, no. Of course not. - Goodnight. Goodnight. She'll be back, I know. She'll be back. Oh, what'll we do? Put your pajama coat on, and pretend you're in bed. That'll convince her. I suppose if your dumbness is so alluring. Say, are you trying to flirt with me? No-o-o! (Angela) 'Yoo-hoo.' - She's back again. - Oh. 'I forgot something.' I forgot to bring you your slippers, Jimmy. Funny, I never noticed what large feet you have. Oh, enormous. [sighs] [chuckles] Well, goodnight. Goodnight. - Well, goodnight, again. - Goodnight. [door shuts] Get out of here, you viper! 'Yoo-hoo.' Did someone call? 'You forgot to put out the light in the living room.' 'Oh, but don't bother, I'll put it out. Ha ha.' - 'Goodnight.' - Goodnight. You know, I think-- Don't think, you'll get stroked. Lock her in her room. But.. I'll unlock her in the morning and we'll settle it over the orange juice. Over the apple sauce. Oh. What did you come back for? Here's the key. I've locked her in. - Good. Now, lock yourself out. - Delighted. And take your props with you, insect. Like a little peace. As far as I'm concerned, you can rest in it. (Jimmy) 'Goodnight, turtle dove.' Jimmy. - Is that you, Jimmy? - Certainly not. - What do we do? - Did he see you? Hide. If you love your life, hide. [knocking on door] (Bob) 'Jimmy, who's in there with you?' [knocking on door] [knocking continues] 'What are you doing in Trixie's room?' What? Well, I.. Oh, not under the bed. He always looks there first. Well, where can I go? -'Who's in there?' - Here. I think I can go...right over there though. That's a much.. It's all your fault. [knocking continues] Jimmy, open this door! Is anybody there? 'You know perfectly well there's somebody here.' 'If you don't open this door, I will.' [banging on door] 'Open this door!' Go away old man, I'm busy. Of course, he wouldn't look in the closet. - Hide somewhere. - Oh, where? 'You'd better open this door.' Isn't there somewhere else you can go? 'I know where you can go.' Well, you go there first, tell 'em I'm coming. 'What?' [knocking on door continues] 'Jimmy.' [knocking on door] Will you open this door? (Jimmy) 'Leave me alone, old man, I'm in conference.' In conference? (Jimmy) 'Oh-h-h.' How can I hide when you uncover me? 'Jimmy!' Trixie isn't here, I've just borrowed her apartment. 'Oh, yeah.' 'Well, if Trixie isn't there, why won't you open this door?' I can't find my shoes. Come on. 'They were in your hand a moment ago.' 'Are you going to open this door?' [knocking on door] [sighs] - 'Jim-m-my!' - You are so hot headed. Hi-ho. 'Open up, Jimmy. I'm not blind.' 'I saw you going in Trixie's room.' Oh, Bob. 'Come out.' Oh, Bob. [knocking on door] 'Jimmy.' 'You want me to break this door down?' I wouldn't have your suspicious nature for anything in the world. 'You won't have anything to live for, when I get through you.' 'Jimmy, for the last time.' 'Are you going to open this door?' Yes, don't worry, I'll unlock it. 'About time you oppose that sentence.' 'Now, hurry, let me inside.' 'Come on, Jimmy.' (Bob) 'You've got a lot of explaining to do.' Oh, wait a minute, you'll see there's nobody here at all. Ah! Open that door. We're going to settle this thing, once and for all. Oh! - Well. - Hello, Bobby. [clears throat] Lovely evening, isn't it? Go ahead. Explain. - What are you doing here? - Believe it or not, I-- Tell me you're waiting for a street car and I'll brain you. No. Trixie, come out from under that thing. Bob, please don't get in to fuss, this is purely platonic. - Platonic? - Yes. Oh, yeah. Platonic pajamas, I suppose. Well, I can't explain now. But, I.. And what about those slippers? - My feet are cold. - Hmph. Get off that bed. Honestly, Bob, this isn't who you think it is. Well, we'll see. Please, remember, you're in the presence of a lady. If it isn't Trixie, why can't I see her? Because I'm protecting her reputation. It's a little late for that. I'm going to see for myself. - Over my dead body! - Well, excuse me. (Trixie) 'Bob.' What's all the noise about? What are you doing here? - Trixie. - There you are, big bully. I hope you're ashamed of yourself. - Where were you? - Sleeping in the other room. I loaned mine to Jimmy's girlfriend. Oh, I-I.. Jimmy. I'm so sorry, old man. Young lady, please accept my profoundest apologies for butting in. Quite alright, old man. Quite alright. Well, aren't you going to introduce us? Sure, Jimmy, go ahead and show Bob your girlfriend. Ohhh. Oh, I'm...I can't. No. The truth is, the lady is married. - No. - Oh, yeah. - You snake in the grass. - Keep off the girl. She's perfectly respectable. - Her husband must be a sap. - Oh. Oh, he is. Yes. Indeed, he is. Come on, old man, let's go. My friend is suffocating. No, I think, I ought to meet her. Young lady, won't you, please come out and join us in a foursome for supper. Oh, no, Bob. Oh, no. I've had a hectic night. You run along with Jimmy. I've gotta salvage what's left of the girlfriend. Come on, man, please let's go, will you? Oh, alright. But I don't know where I'm going. I'm as free as the air. I've left home. - For me? - For good? - For the good of all women. - Uh-huh. What about Angela? Angela? She doesn't know where I am... and she doesn't care. The mastermind. You came here to spy on me, and got caught in your own trap. No. Oh, how can he like you? Hmm. That's my secret. Nothing secret about you. You're common and cheap. Hmm. Oh, no, dearest. You're all wrong. I'm uncommonly expensive. You're just sore, because you couldn't hold him. I wouldn't use your methods. You would if you could, but you don't know how. I admit it. I give my life to make a home for him. That's not a home. It's an ice plank. Oh, you wives gimme a pain. I've heard a lot of that hooey about bought kisses. Yours are the kisses that are bought. Bought with a stylish wedding and a big empty house. Something for nothing. That's the marriage game. - What do you give him? - What do I give him? I laugh when he does. I drink when he does. I give him a pow with lipstick kisses, a shoulder to hug. I give a dream made out of perfume and soft lights. I jazz all the dullness, out of his soul for him. I believe you, I've thrown away my whole life. You didn't throw it away, you put it in a safe deposit box. - And now, you've lost the key. - 'I tried to keep my ideals.' - Oh, I get along without them. - Why, of course you do. All you got is a-- Is a body, made out of flesh and blood. Is that what you mean? Well, I'm not ashamed of it. It got me where I am today. Alright...I'll be flesh and blood, too. What? In that, Mother Huffin? Oh, you've got a lot to learn. So have you. You'll learn that men like their woman decent. You'll learn not to laugh at good women. Some of us have more feeling in a finger than you have in your whole body. - We're afraid. - You've got reason to be. Now, I'm not afraid any longer. I'll get my husband back from you. - Try and do it. - Alright, I will. You made him sick of virtue. I'll make him sick of indecency. I'll give him perfume, and jazz until his head reels. He wants some hot, does he? Alright, I'll give him a volcano. You'll have to call up a whole fire department to put me out. [door slams] [radio signal beeping] [crowd singing "We're Going Somewhere"] [all singing] [singing continues] [instrumental music] [male singing "We're Going Somewhere"] [crowd singing] [upbeat music] [music continues] [crowd cheering] [dramatic music] (female #1) 'That's the spirit of modern power" You mean the power of modern spirits? [radio alert beeping] ["Ballet Mecanique"] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [radio signal beeping] [instrumental music] [music continues] [music continues] Bravo. [crowd cheering] [indistinct cheering] [crowd laughing] Well, that is one way of advertising an oil company. For a society's sap head, Jimmy's certainly got ideas. I don't like it. It's a shame to see a beautiful piece of flying machinery turned into a dance hall. Oh, now, don't go up in the air. Mr. and Mrs. High Hat. [crowd cheering] 'Miss Conning Tower.' Mr and Mrs. Hot and tot. [crowd cheering] Ooh. Look at that costume. Ms. Victory. [crowd cheering] Ms. Movie Fan. [people cheering] Mr and Mrs. Henry VIII. [crowd cheering] The princess, Hands Off. Ms. Golden Peasant. [crowd cheering] And Mr. H-E Man [crowd cheering] Wait a minute, Bob. How do you like my costume? Ha ha. Great. Where is it? Nobody could possibly guess who I am, could they? No, darling. No one...but me. Well, if it isn't little Trixie. How's Trix? How'd you know me? I knew you by your appendix scar. Excuse me, sir. But do you mind explaining that last remark? Well, you see, I was her surgeon. Oh. Ha ha. I beg your pardon. It's alright, darling. - Are you a surgeon? - No, I'm a stockbroker. Oh. [bells ringing] [cymbal clanging] Time to take off your farce faces. Be yourselves. [crowd cheers] [cheering continues] [indistinct chattering] Let's have a drink. - How's it going? - Fine. Trixie. I'm certainly having fun at your opening, Jimmy. Hello, Jimmy. Ah? Oh, hello, Bobby. - Welcome to my opening. - Thanks. This one certainly has a silver lining. Say Jimmy, how do you like my costume? Isn't it a picture? Slightly over exposed, I should say. Oh, you...you always did like your sweeties under cover. Ssh, careful. 'Jim, Jimmy.' Hey, what's become of that mysterious sweetie of yours? - Ah. Who? Ah. - Ah. Oh. Well she's around you know, somewhere. I-- - Listen. I want to meet her. - You must excuse me, Herman. I've got to go auction off the loved ones. - You understand. - But yeah. Just a minute. - The big event of the evening. - The auction? The girl who gets the highest bid is the belle of the ball. Papa will bid high for baby, won't he? - Ah? - Oh, darling, I just knew you would. You're just.. [indistinct chattering] Attention, ladies. Will the six most beautiful women in the room please step this way? (all) Why? Certainly. [ladies shouting] I agree with you! Unfortunately, a committee of desperately brave men have already made a choice. [all] Aww.. The lady exceeding the highest bid will be Queen of the ball. [women shouting] 'Gentlemen.' 'I want you to observe the charms' 'of these lovely guests' 'and bid against each other for the privilege' 'of dancing the love waltz with your favorite.' Who gets the money? - 'Charity?' - Yeah. What charity? 'The families of bell boys who mind their own business.' [everyone laughs] Ready? Step up, Gentlemen. Step. Now's the time to show us the best. Take a look at.. [all men] Oh! What eyes. What lips. Well, what do I bid? - '20 dollars.' - Shame on you. - '40 Dollars.' - That won't do. Classify this. You're all confused. The spirit of.. Uh. Pardon me, what are you? I am the spirit of innocent pride. 'Cause I'm proud of the fact that I have nothing.. ...to hide. 'Who will bid a 100. Going once, going twice.' I will. Sold. As cheap as half the price. [men shouting] Look here, Gentlemen, look. Now, is the time to take a.. Take a look at this wonderful dish. Looks like a girl and drinks like a fish. $100. - 'Make it two.' - Two hundred. 'Good for you.' Look at that face, that form refined. The spirit of.. Pardon me, what's your line? Why, I've never been caught. And my claim to glory is I'm the original fish store. [people chattering] Who'll bid 300? Come on. Show us some pluck.' I will. Sold and I wish you luck. [people shouting] Hold the line with her. Leash on to that hook. Look at this beauty. Hold out if you can. Here is the baby that can make any man leave his whole duties. What are you child? Ah, be your age. I'm a "Call of the Wild." [men laughing] - 400. - Sold. The best bargain of all. And I hope you'll be able to answer the call. [people shouting] Look at this, Neptune's daughter. Aren't you perfect? * I suppose to be water * Then I'm all wet. I can't guess what you are. Don't ask me to try it. [singing] Ha ha. I'll take them both. No matter how high. - 'Romeo.' - I have such a.. And now think of master of triumph in gold. The fear to resist on is about to be sold. [all] Aww. Never seen such a sassy, no one ever sees. Expensive but classy. Come, what are my bids? Five hundred. - Six. - Seven. If you get her, you'll pay? - Eight. - Nine hundred. What are you saying? Look at that form, that face with appeals of the soft smooth roundness of those heels. (all) Aww.. - I bid 1000. - Don't tell me that's all. - 1100. - Twelve. For the belle of the ball. I'll make it.. [Madam Satan singing] * Oh.. * - What was that call? - Do you hear it, too? [indistinct operatic song] [indistinct operatic song] - Jimmy, do you know the devil? - No. But I'm going to. Wait. * Who are you * * Oh we're glad that you're with us * * And a new thrill you give us * * Won't you please tell us who you are * * Well, I am a girl you're in love with * * For you I'm a stranger * * I have come up from hell * [men cheering] [Madam Satan singing, "Meet Madam" with everyone] [singing continues] [singing continues] [singing continues] [singing continues] [singing continues] Hey, what's the idea? Forget that Devil dame and finish this auction. [people shouting] We will have a little friendly competition. Friendly? Nothing. I think you're a fake. Ha ha. I am. But who'll bid for Madam Satan? I will. 1500. Wait a minute. Who'll bid for a swell chicken with modern improvements? Sixteen hundred with or without feathers. Seventeen hundred for Satan. Quitter. Wait a minute. This isn't fair. You can see my face but you can't see her's. Make her unmask. I'll bet she's homely as the devil. - 'Yes, take it off.' - 'Unmask.' (male #1) 'Yes, take off your mask.' I'm afraid, you'll have to. You see, everybody else have. [people shouting] Ok. With pleasure Madam Satan remove her mask. When all your masks are off. You, Mr. Wall street, you do not wear the mask of the shepherd when you slay the lamb. You, mademoiselle, you do not hide ugly gossip beyond a friendly smile. You, Madam, is that the same face you show your husband in the morning. You, you, all of you. Is one of you without a mask? - Well, I'm there. - Ah, you. The mask of a misunderstood husband. You are not wearing it tonight, no? Parlez vous. And you, it is obvious. You are masking nothing. [everyone laughs] You can deceive husbands, wives, lovers, sweetheart. But you cannot deceive this devil. No, but you can dance with us. Who bids? - I will. 1800 - 19. [indistinct shouting] Masked or unmasked. - I bid $3000. - Sold to Bobby Brooks. [people talking] Now, let the dance go on. [ballroom music] You may get burned. My heart is made of asbestos. Wonderful. Marvelous. Beautiful. How do you do? All coin, just for you. [Madam Satan singing "All I Know Is You're in my arms"] [singing continues] [singing continues] [singing continues] [singing continues] [singing continues] [applause] Do you see what I see? Oh, ho, ho. No, no. I'll fix that. (female #2) 'Hello. How have you been?' Well, Mrs. Devil, if you're finished with my boyfriend I'll take him. You have a monopoly? Say once I kiss 'em, they're mine. Aha. I'm sure he would not know your kiss from any other. Deaf, dumb or blind, he'd know me, anyway. Is it so? Well, then let us blindfold him and see. - Oh, she's a-- - Yes.. - That's an excellent idea. - Let's try it. You're wrong. I'll show that masked bandit something. Give me a blindfold, somebody. Come here, Bobby darling. Doc, Betty, Marianne. Come on, we'll each kiss him and see if he knows who's who. - 'This is very hard.' - 'Oh boy, this is great.' Well, come along girls. The line form's on the right. 'I could do better.' [laughs] All butterflies are early this evening. (all) 'Aah..' Oh, baby, say, what are your plans for the summer? Kiss again if you like it. 'Ah-ah-ah..' Oh. wow. Ha ha. Why of course. I'll know that kiss anywhere. Trixie. [laughing] Come, come, this' our baby day. Who wants to go to hell with Madam Satan? [shouting] No, no. I take only the wickedest man here. Uh-huh. Well, of course. You'll take me. Monsieur is boasting. Oh. I'm wickeder than he is. - You are? - I've neverrepenteda sin. I never repeated one. [everyone laughs] Well, I've never been able to believe that anything I did, was a sin. [everybody laughs] You will. Come, monsieur. Maybe I can make him change his mind, yeah? It's a waste of time to take a married man to hell. [everyone laughs] That French dame can't stay on the same ship with me. - No? - No. Meadows, bring Ms. Trixie's cloak and parachute. [horn blowing] [indistinct chattering] [people talking] (male #2) 'Wait. Let's go, wanna see it.' [indistinct talking] What do they do in here? Oh, this is the chart room. Where, where we learn which course to follow. Ha ha ha. You do not want to get locked with me, you know? I'd love it. Oh. I warn you it may be a stormy sea. Well. I'm a very good sailor. Tell me, uh. What is your name? Bob. Nice Boob. - You know everything. - Yes. I know you are not happy. - Why? I didn't say so. Did I? - No. I see inside you. Really? And what do you see? Madam, X-ray? I see a man who want all women, understand none? That's because I never can find the one I'm looking for. Ha ha. Maybe you look too far away, monsieur. And all the time, the one you want is very near you. Waiting. You are married, yes? Well, yes and no. That is, it's a little bit uncertain. Oh! You do not love your wife? No? - I respect her. - Oh, poor woman. Maybe you love this "Tricky" person. Yeah? Oh! Never mind about "Tricky'. Let's talk about you. Tell me. - Who are you? - Madam Satan. Address, Hades only street. Telephone, brimstone one...oh! Oh, oh. You certainly are a gorgeous devil. Oh no. No, I thought you were a sinner. You act like a school boy. Lu Cafe Dijon, for Madam Satan. [speaking in foreign language] Oh, merci. Monsieur, you mean, send me Cafe Dijon to cool me off. Cool you off? Just what will you take, to warm you up. I need nothing for that, little school boy. Alright. You be the schoolteacher. And I'll be your prized pupil. - And the reward, a kiss? - No, not yet. The road to my hometown is filled with kisses. Splendid! Let's break the speed limit. No, if you come to hell with me, you may find it heaven. Anywhere with you...would be heaven. Oh...heaven is love. No. Oh. Come now, come, let us drink to this delightful torment they call, life. Why, life is love. Drink. Ha ha ha. I'll say, this stuff is hotter than the.. You want to go to the devil but you don't like the flame. I'll risk them. Tell me. To what part of hell will you take me first? First of all, first of all. I will take you where the naughty husband are. - Naughty husband? - Hm-hm. - How about the cold wives? - There are no wives in hell. They get their punishment on this earth. If all the wives are in heaven I suppose that's why most husbands chose the other place. Oh, monsieur, what a terrible wife you must have. To make you so bitter. We're playing a gorgeous game. Please don't spoil it. Why not take me to heaven? Instead of hell. Ha, If I do, will you wipe out the memory of every other woman from your eye? Well, I.. Oh. Come now. Answer me. Oh, take me in your arms. Now. Now. Tell me the truth from your heart. The truth? The truth is I can't pretend, about love. Ha ha ha. The truth is, no woman comes with you. You are in love, with love. [cello music] Make me forget everything. Please, let me take off your mask. Oh, no. Please don't. Without the mask, Madam Satan is lost. With or without it, I'm lost. - Oh, please take it off. - Oh, no. Please don't. Oh, I'm so sure, you'd be disappointed. You see, I'm not the devil I pretend. I'm just a silly woman who want to keep her self-respect. Well, I'm not in the habit of collecting ladies' self-respect. As a matter of fact I think you're even more charming. As a good little devil. I can assure you. You have nothing to fear, as far as I'm concerned. You do not mind the change? Oh, now. Now, maybe we do find heaven. But you said just now that heaven was love. Love. Such a little word for such a big sin. - Having a good time? - It's all perfect. What a marvelous idea to have a party in the air. - I'm glad you like it.. - Wade. Ohh. They've been there for half an hour. It's not decent. Of course, not. It's a successful party. It's going to be a successful riot if you don't get Bob out. - I couldn't possibly interrupt. - No? Well, I could. Oh, wait a minute, Trixie, please! If you don't get Bob away from that woman - Do you know what I'll do? - Something unpleasant I'm sure. I'll tell him that the girl, under the quilt was his own wife. Trixie, you must never tell Bob that. - It might be misunderstood. - Then break that up! Don't ask me to do that-- You tell him that that devil fish is your own girlfriend. Because I'm gonna-- Alright, alright, alright! I will. Bob ought to be home with his own wife, anyhow! [thunder rumbling] Ahem, lovely evening, isn't it? Will you pardon me while I kill the host? I must hand it to you. You have a genius for being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Well, you have an even greater genius for being with the wrong woman at the wrong time. (Bob) 'What do you mean?' And you brought one girl to the party. Why monopolize mine? What...yours? Well, I admit you only met her once. - And that was...undercover. - Huh? Are you trying to tell me, that Madam Satan was the girl in Trixie's bedroom? (Jimmy) 'That was my general idea.' - Why, it's ridiculous. - Ridiculous perhaps. But I'll trouble you not to poach on my preserves. Jimmy. Do you really mean that? - 'Uh-huh.' - 'Alright, you needn't worry.' I won't poach on your preserves anymore. Good. After all, you're my friend and.. Oh, then came a carriage filled with flowers. What are you mumbling about? What? Oh...I thought.. I thought we might have them thunder shower. Ha ha ha. Not dumb. But you devil cannot be idle. She must go. Au bientot, Jimmy. Au revoir, nice boob. - Mm, boob is right. - Oh, now, Bob. You're taking this thing too seriously. Just forget what I said. And if you like her, go ahead. So, you changed your mind. Have you? After all, you-you are my best friend and I have a very high conception of friendship. I'll say, you have. What's mine is, is yours. And what's yours, I don't want. Oh! All those wishing to view the body...hm. [crowd chattering] [thunder rumbling] - That doesn't look so good. - No, sir. - Report to the control room. - Yes, sir! I have to speak to, Mr. Wade. We better get these people off, right away. Yes, sir. I've been looking for you, Mr. Wade. - There's a storm coming up. - I-I know what it is. I suggest that you send your guests down at once. Why? [thunder rumbling] You hear? The barometer's been falling all day. And I'm afraid that we're in for a very bad night of it. [wind howling] [indistinct chattering] Ha ha ha. Ha ha. Monsieur trying to be funny. Oh, I thought we might finish our little romance. Ah, my sense of humor is undeveloped there. Like your sense of honor, perhaps. You know a great deal about honor? Well, I do hide under the bed quilt. My presence there upset your own plans maybe, yes. - You do admit, you were there. - Most certainly. - Ha ha ha. - Ha ha ha. And you almost had me sold on that innocence and self respect stuff. A little knowledge of them would not hurt you, monsieur. [indistinct chattering] Hey, Bob. Look here. I'll show you some real brim stone. Orchestra, play "Low Down" and make it hot. [orchestral music] * Hold me to begin * * I wanna but still didn't wanna give in * * I've got something.. * Well, why you do not dance with your little Trixie? At least she's on a level. She doesn't pretend to be what she's not. Ha ha ha. And what is she? You think a warm baby, yes? Alright, we shall see. [speaking in foreign language] [speaking in foreign language] [crowd chattering] And heat wave is coming, Madame Satan starts to burn. [cheering] (Madame Satan) Ha ha ha. Orchestra, start over again. [orchestra music] * Low down low down * * Let's make it a show down * * You're claiming that you are flaming * * But you'll soon tire out and put the fire out * * You think you're hot * * I'll tell you, you are not * * And between us when men have seen us * * You'll find them waiting for Madame Satan * * Come, everybody * * Satan will show you a new sensation * [music continues] Ha ha. You think you are a Casanova. To me you are just the ice man. Yes, I bet you known plenty of ice men. Never one of these men are as bad as you are. Come on, Bob. Let's show 'em up. Don't you worry. I'll make that hell cat feel at home. What are you going to do? I'm going to give you the kind of love, you are used to. You had your laugh, now I'm going to have mine. Alright. Laugh. Angie. You told me I was below zero, so, I raised my temperature. Yes. But you raised it a little too high. You seem to enjoy it earlier in the evening. Eh...well, that was different. You think, I can respect a woman, who comes-- Oh, Bob, I don't want your respect I want you to love me as I love you. As you love me? [thunder rumbling] Bob, oh no. Oh, Bob, what happened? I-I don't know. [siren wailing] [screaming] (Angela) Oh my God! - Are you are you hurt? - Oh, no. [siren continues wailing] Oh, Bob, what's happening? Something must have struck us. Bob, don't leave me! Bob! She's torn lose from the mooring mast. Set adrift. [screaming] It doesn't look like a picnic to me. We've broken lose. Prepare yourself.. Not so hot, aye. I'll say it's hot. Remember the shattered door? Hey, don't talk about that. [whistling] Mr. Blake, the controls are smashed. Get all these people in to parachutes. Parachutes! (male on loud speaker) Everybody, everybody, line up for parachute harness. Make way for parachute harness. Engineers starting our motor, sir. - Help me evacuate these people. - Right, sir. [engine revving] Parachutes, sir. (male #3) Break out the parachute harness. 'We got the parachute harness.' Come on man, hurry up. [screaming] [screaming continues] Wait. Stay at the top. I'll get your parachutes. Oh, no, Bob. Bob, don't leave me. You got yourself into this mess. So hang on. I'll try and get you out. Bob! Bob! I want to get a parachute. I will not obey you. I want parachute myself. Don't wanna chance. Don't worry. How do you get into this parachute? - I've never worn one. - Alright, then help me. Hey, where do I get a harness? (male #4) Down there in that bunk. (female #1) Where do I get off? - Where do I jump? - Where are you going? Get off me. (female #3) You are pulling out my hair. Somebody help me out! Help me! Thank you. I apologize.. Here, put this on. You'll have to jump for it. Bobby, Bobby. Save me. I can't find a parachute, save me. Alright. I'll get you one. I don't want you on my conscience. - Get into that, quick. - Bob, wait. What do I do? Takes more courage for this than for home wrecking, doesn't it? - Mrs. Brooks, for the love of.. - I told you, I'd get him back. Oh, I don't want your husband. I want a parachute. Well, you want this one? - Oh! - On one condition. You promise to never to see my husband again. - And you'll give it to me? - Yes, I'll give it to you. - I'll promise anything. - Gimme your word. On my word, I'll be. Help me get into it. Help me. How do I do it? You got me up here. Now, you get me down. Please don't do that. Centipedes make me nervous. Hey Blake, are there any more parachute harness? Try and find one. - Oh, your head is stuck. - No, I.. Oh, Blake! How do you get into these things? Put your arms and buckle up. Snap shoulder strap on the D-link on the parachute kept on the promenade deck. Got it? - Got it. - Yeah, big help. Wait a minute. The bands always play when the ship is sinking. Come on now. Do your stuff. Where do we go from here, huh? [orchestra music] [screaming] They're all going down there! They're leaving behind. I am not going to attend another party. I beg your pardon. This lady is sick.. Oh, no, I'm not! I'm not! [indistinct screaming] [screaming] Oh, are you perfectly sure, this parachute will open? If it doesn't, bring it back and we'll give you another. Oh, thank you very much and good bye. [wind wailing] Oh, I feel sick. Where's the parachute? Out there. (Trixie) 'I'm afraid.' I can't! I can't! Oh, what will I do? Here, pull down that parachute and buckle it on that pole. Wait a minute. May be you want to kill me. - I'll go for it. - Oh, what will I do? Can't do it alone. Help me. Come back here. I can't get it right, if you slip down there. [engine whirring] Hey, give me one of those for the ladies. - No. I need both. - No, you don't. Oh, I'll be smashed to a jelly. Oh, no. You'll drown. Angela! Angela! Here you are, Trixie. Get.. Angela, where's your parachute harness? I have it. She was afraid, I'll tell you, why she and Jimmy were in my apartment, huh. Laugh that off. [screaming] [wind wailing] - Your Trixie is saved anyway. - Come along. Get into this. - Bob, where's yours? - Never mind. Put this on. Oh, no. I will not jump without you. I'm not asking you, what will you do. I'm telling you. - Angela, quickly come. - I can't jump without you. [orchestra music] (male #2) 'Everybody off, she's breaking up.' 'And how?' - She's breaking up. - No, I'm the host. - I won't leave till the end. - You'll leave now. I will not. [thunder rumbling] Bob, we're going to crash. Oh, please. Please take me in your arms. Hold me. Hold me as you did when you thought I was somebody else. Come along, quick. Please, Bob. Bob, let me stay with you.. You made a fool out of me. You're not going to make a coward out of me. Oh, Bob. Please please, I don't want to go Bob. Bob, darling, I love you. Oh, darling I love you. Oh, please, come on. Bob, please don't leave me. Come on. She's breaking up. Out of that window. [wind wailing] [gasping] A-a-aye, look out, below. Hey! That's voodooism. Voodoo? I don't believe in these things. I'm scared of nothing on this earth.. - What is that? - Move! [indistinct talking] Oh! Oh! I beg your pardon. My husband is in the city reservoir. - I want you're help. - Let's go go. Don't leave me. My husband is in the city reservoir. Please, don't leave me. Please, don't go. [indistinct talking] Help. Somebody help me get down from here. Oh, come here. Come here. How do I get down? I don't know. I'm just passing through, myself. Well, come back and help me. Help me. Come on, come here. Oh, you come back here and help me. - It's too late now. - Oh, dear. I come here every week, to get rid of fat. (male #3) And I come here every week, to get rid of women. It's the only place left, where they don't horn in. [screaming] - Hey, what's this? - It's a girl. - A girl! - What happened? Oh, my habit's crazy. [chattering] Phew. [lion roaring] Oh-h-h. Oh dear! It-it isn't nearly 9 o'clock, yet, you know. Oh...oh, dear. (guard) Hey! What are you doing in there? Oh, what a silly question. [lion roaring] [printing press rolling] (man on radio) 'Due to the captain's decision to send all the guests' 'off in parachutes. No one was seriously injured.' 'Although, some landed in a rather undignified manner.' 'In only one case, was the parachute missing.' 'But fortunately, the gentlemen made a landing' 'in the middle of the city reservoir.' 'And the man..' Where did you ever learn to dance like that? We love and learn. [piano music] * A pair of arms to hold you * * Voila * * So tenderly I hold you * * Voila * Where did you learn to sing a song like that? * I sing it for you * * Sheri * Huh. * A pair of eyes to see you * * Voila * * With all the things to please you * * Voila * And that dress, it was absolutely outrageous. Bob, you know, you'd adore that dress on any other woman. Nothing of that sort. It was the most indecent thing I ever saw. Oh-h-h.

Jolly party, wasn't it? Say, what were you doing in Trixie's apartment? With that little... broken down blimp. Wait a minute. Don't call me names. I'm here to do the right thing by Angela. What? You're here to do what? If you're going to divorce her, I'm prepared to marry her. - Why, Jimmy. How noble of you. - I know. Who said anything about divorce? Do you suppose, I'll get Angela free, to marry a little-- - Now don't call me a.. - O-o-oh! * Low down low down * * Let's make it a show down * Oh, please don't play that, Angela. Please. It reminds me of Trixie. Poor Trixie. I don't blame her for liking Bob. But.. * True love is believing * * The one we love is quite a brag * * deceived * Angela, when you sing that-- You want to know, what I was doing at Trixie's apartment? No no, I don't darling.
