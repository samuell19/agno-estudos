(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING) Hey, buddy. How's it going? This was a good night. I tell you, that band was cooking, man. You guys, you just... Nick, you were blowing. Once again, man. Hot. That's good to hear, man. I'm... I'm glad. I need to know, man, where's my money, though? Because I got about two bucks on me. Nick, when the man pays me, then I pay you. Yeah It's that trickledown thing. You know. I know you know. Oh, yeah. I see you got another problem over there. But let me tell you something. You best be back here in two hours. Because if you don't, I'm gonna leave your ass here. I know what's going on. Yeah, yeah. I ain't lying, Nick. I'm gonna leave you like a left foot. (MOANING) (GASPING) MAN: Son of a bitch! Hey, asshole! That's my girlfriend you're fucking! Hey, come on, man. Not my sax! Hit him! Come on! Hit him again! Hit him again. Hit him in the gut! Get up! Get the fuck up! Get him! (MOOING) Did they leave my money? (LAUGHING) You've got to be kidding. BUS DRIVER: Bus for Los Angeles now boarding with stops at Lubbock, El Paso, Tucson, Phoenix. Final destination, Los Angeles. (WOMAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ON PA) I won't even ask. Good. It's a boring story. Yeah, right. So, how long are you back for? Depends on this and that. HOSTESS: Your husband's already here, Mrs. Hannon. Thank you. Hi, honey. Nick. Dad. Good to see you, Nick. Good to see you too, Dad. (SIGHS) So... I give up. What happened? I cut myself shaving. She's been after me for a while now to put together my own band. I think the timing's perfect. That sounds great. Yeah. It's... It's... It's a great opportunity, you know? And all I need's three top players, wheels, new sax. I can gig cross country. I could cut a record. What's stopping you? Well, I'm a little short on capital. Capital? How short? Only five grand. Oh, five grand? Well, have you thought about working? Well, I... I work. I'm a musician. Well, it doesn't seem to be paying the rent, does it? Oh, but... What you do, that's meaningful, right? Swooping down on some property, and kicking people out and raising their rent. -That's a real contribution to the world. -Nick, we're not talking about me. We're talking about you. Look, I just need a loan. No, you need a handout. No! I need a loan! Okay. I'll tell you what. You can earn it. You can come to work for me for two months, and I'll pay you $5,000. You gonna make me vice president? Nick, I think your father is trying to say... -No, it's... It's all right. Listen. Nick, have you given one thought at all to what your life is gonna be like when you're 40 or 50? Maybe I won't live that long. You know? I don't know. We Hannons aren't exactly known for our longevity. I just lost my appetite. That wasn't fair. Oh, I know. Kelly. I, uh, got the prospectus on the Bellevue deal. I'd like you to take a look at it, tell me what you think. It's done. Done? I say pass and don't look back. We are not gonna jump through hoops for a lousy 6%. (CHUCKLES) Yeah. Ah! Beach house this week? Oh! A little rest, a little exercise? Kelly, come on. You know we can't do it. We're too busy. NICK: Hey, guys. Hi, Nick. So, I was doing a little thinking. Guess I'll take that... Take you up on that job offer. Good. But I was thinking for more like a month. No. Two months. All right. Six weeks. No. Two months. It's my final offer. Take it or leave it. Deal. Good. Wanna shake on it? It's good, Nick. I'm awful glad you're with us. Yeah, right. (SIGHS) Like father, like son. What does that mean? Do you wanna go for a dip in the pool later? (LAUGHS) It's freezing. You're no fun anymore, Ted. Come join me. Yeah, any minute now. (CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING) Thank you. VENDOR: You have a nice day, all right? There you go. (BOTH EXCLAIMING) You got it? Yeah. Hey, do you mind if I take your picture? No, thanks. It's just for my portfolio. I'm a student of beauty. Does this actually get you dates? Well, not as many as I'd like. That's what I thought. Sorry, we're late for an appointment. Well, that's too bad, 'cause I wanted to shoot yours too. Oh, nice try, slick. Come on. Two shots. One. Two. Boom, boom. Smile. Look this way. You sure you don't model? Come on. Give me a nice, big smile. That's nice. Beautiful. Just one more shot. Come on. Just one more shot. TED: Herschel, just listen to me. You get that guy's rent by Friday, or both your butts are going to be on the pavement. Got that? Yeah. Just get it, will you? Yeah, thanks. Bye. Hey, hey, wait a minute. What is this? What do you mean? This is legal. Well, that's what's in the machine. Well, maybe I better talk to the machine then, huh? Thanks for the flowers, baby. They're beautiful. You're welcome, but I didn't get them for you. Now, take it back and do it letter size. You got that? "Pretty flowers for a pretty lady. Thank you for gracing my portfolio. "P.S. Here's a few of my favorite shots." (LAUGHING) Who is this guy? A photographer that Meredith and I ran into on Saturday. And you just, uh, let him take your picture? What'd you do that for? You know it's just a come-on. Really? Yeah, really. You know, I'm a little disappointed that the flowers weren't from you. Meaning? Meaning it's nice to be appreciated every once in a while. TED: I really don't care. No. All I'm asking you to do is just to live up... Yeah. Listen, you work on it, okay? I'll get back to you later. All right. Yeah. Bye. -Get me some newspaper. -Okay. Kelly, please. (SIGHS) So, this is, uh, your photographer friend? What was I supposed to do? I don't know, Kelly. I don't know. But please just get rid of it, okay? No. Look how cute he is. Just hold him for a minute. -Hold him. Hold him. -Yeah, please. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. It's beautiful. -It's a beautiful animal. Here. -See? You, take this, please, and just take it away somewhere. Okay? You are cold. Yeah. And you, listen... Would you please just... If you're gonna work in this office, get your hair cut, wear some decent clothes. What are you coming down on me for? -I didn't do anything! -I'm not coming down on you. Just do it. Okay? Please. (CLEARING THROAT) Our luggage is still in Greece, and we're standing there, in the middle of one of the coldest places on the face of the Earth in a pair of Bermuda shorts (LAUGHING) and a bikini. (DOORBELL RINGING) -Excuse me. -No, no, honey. That's all right. I'll get it. Sorry. I'm gonna finish this. Be right back. (LAUGHING) Every time Ted tells that story, it gets bigger and bigger and bigger. Whoo-hoo, huh? There you are. A little present from, uh, Romeo. Friend of ours. A mutual friend. We'd all like to see, I'm sure, wouldn't we? Well, go on, open it. What's the matter? Excuse me. Can we talk about this later? Sorry. The point is, you gave him a mixed message. Oh, so it's all my fault. No. It's not your fault. What'd he give you anyway, huh? Can we look? How'd he get our address, anyway? What'd you do? Give it to him when you gave him the business card? No! I did not. Oh, I suppose he finessed it from some secretary, huh? Or the DMV. Or maybe he followed me home. He's starting to scare me, Ted. Honey, just do what I tell you, and it'll be all right. Just call him on the phone. Go on. (RINGING) Hi. This is Bobby. Leave your name and number at the tone. -It's a machine. -All right. Just leave him a message. (BEEPS) This is Mrs. Hannon. Now, I've told you before, I am a married woman, and I am not interested. Now, please stop sending me gifts. Enough! (HANGS UP) (ANSWERING MACHINE BEEPS) It's gonna be all right, honey. Come on, come on. Come on. All right, come on. Let's go back down there. (DOOR OPENING) Ah! Nick. Dad. Oh! Lot of fireworks last night, huh? Yep. You know, that phone call ain't gonna do you a damn bit of good. I know how you gotta deal with this guy. I had a friend in Kansas City... Well, first, what you gotta do is cut her some slack, 'cause it's not her fault. -Anyways, this buddy of mine... -Hey, hey, hey. Just wait a minute. Just slow down. What are you trying to do here? Just trying to help out. (LAUGHING) You? You're trying to help me? Well, no. Actually, I got an even better idea. Why don't you just give the guy a gun, and maybe he'll just blow his head off the way Mom did. (SIGHS) (JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING) (GROANING) Oh! Can't sleep? (SIGHS) So... Tell me, Kelly. Are you happy? (LAUGHING) Have you been drinking? That doesn't answer my question. Why'd you marry him? Because I love him. He has a very romantic side. Had a very romantic side. Yeah. Nick... Eyelash. Get some sleep. Paul, your brother's here. PAUL: Great. I'm starved. Thanks. I mean, he sends her something every day. Today it's a plane ticket to Mexico and a brochure for Club fucking Med. Shit. I mean, what can I do? Can I get a restraining order against this creep? Teddy, it's not illegal to send somebody something in the mail. Have there been threats or implied threats? No. Not that I know of. Well, legally, there's not a hell of a lot you can do. The law, huh? What am I supposed to do? Beat him up? No, you are not supposed to beat this guy up. What are you gonna do? Are you gonna beat him up? -No I am not gonna beat him up! -No. Come on, Teddy, look... I will talk to someone I know in the DA's office. In the meantime, don't let Kelly accept anymore gifts from this guy. Yeah. Boy, did she pick the wrong guy to flirt with, didn't she? Guess so. The bottom line is do not let him fuck with your head. All right? Yeah. Okay. Okay. Thanks, bro. All right. I'll see ya. (ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYING) I love my watch. Do you? Good. Hey. Oh. look, it's time for another drink. (LAUGHING) I do believe you are trying to get me drunk. No. What makes you say that? Hey, come on. Let's wrestle. -You don't mind if I cut in, do you? -Excuse me. Hey, hey, hey. What is your problem, anyway, huh? What do you mean? What are you, stupid? She is my wife, you asshole! Ted... Hey... -Ted... -I didn't know she was married. That's not true! Who the hell do you think I am? I thought you were her father. Oh, you... You get out of here! You understand me? You bother my wife one more time, and I'll kill you! All right. I'll fucking kill you! I didn't know she was married. Hey! Okay, sir. I'm going. All right, all right. Ladies and gentlemen, enjoy your meal. Did you see the look on that guy's face when I grabbed him? KELLY: Yeah. You scared the shit out of him. (LAUGHING) Yeah. You haven't fought for me in a long time. Whoa. (LAUGHING) Damn, you look beautiful. Oh, yeah! (LAUGHING) Hey, remember this? Oh, yeah. Ooh! (KELLY LAUGHING) We haven't done this in a while, have we? (BOTH LAUGHING) You know, I've been thinking. Maybe we need a break. That's a good idea. How does Hawaii sound? Serious? Yeah. Good? Perfect. Perfect. (LAUGHING) Boy, you're beautiful. Mr. Hannon, I just heard on the radio that they're having mud slides up in the canyon area. Oh. KELLY: I guess we should go. Yeah. Oh, Judy, why don't you just go home? We'll lock up. Okay? Okay. Sure. Thanks. Come on, old man. I'll race you. (LAUGHING) Whoa. Whoa! It's slippery. Yeah! What is this, huh? Man, that son of a bitch! Ted... Ted... Ted, no! Ted! Ted! (ENGINE STARTING) Shit! -What's going on? -Hi, this is Bobby. Leave a message after the tone. (ANSWERING MACHINE BEEPS) This is Kelly Hannon. LOMAX: Don't hang up. Lomax? Yeah. Listen, I don't know what kind of game you're playing, but this is gonna stop. LOMAX: What do you mean? KELLY: The lingerie was not a very good idea, you sick bastard. My husband's on his way over there right now, and he's gonna tear your head off. Now, I don't want him getting in trouble over a pathetic loser like you. So I suggest that you get the hell out of there right now! (THUNDER RUMBLING) Open the door! Who is it? I warned you, asshole! I bet she looks good in it. I can just see that sweet ass. Open the damn door! She don't want you no more, granddad. 'Cause you can't fuck her like I can. You fucked with the wrong guy this time, asshole! I don't think so. (GASPS) Oh, granddad! Looks like that stings. (CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING) What do we got, Sam? Failure to survive gunshot. I met this guy once. Yeah? Where? 'Round the courthouse. His brother's a lawyer. Really? A lawyer, huh? I think he shot the wrong one. Okay. This never should've happened. Excuse me? You could have prevented the whole thing. I finally got someone on the phone. And? He made bail. (SCOFFS) Perfect. What's the matter with Paul lately? What did he say to you at the funeral? He said... He blames me for what happened. That's ridiculous. No. I didn't handle things very well. I never should've let him take my picture. Kelly, you didn't, you know, go over to the guy's house acting like a raving maniac and threaten him. Ted acted like an idiot. That's not fair. Now, I don't think you're being honest with yourself, Nick. You're acting like you don't care. I think I know better. Oh, you do, huh? Yes, I do. Well, you're wrong. The dispositive provisions of Theodore Jason Hannon's last will and testament are as follows. To various specified charities, a sum total of $25,000. To his brother, Paul Hannon, Investments and cash totaling $256,000. To his wife, Kelly Hannon, the Scarlet Street house, the beach house, 50% ownership of T.J. Hannon Properties, plus stocks, bonds and cash totaling $782,000. To his son, Nicholas Hannon, the remaining 50% of T.J. Hannon Properties. However, there is a provision attached to Nicholas' inheritance of his half of the business. He must work at the company for a minimum of two years. If he is unable to fulfill this obligation for any reason other than serious illness, he will forfeit his interest in the business. In which case, Paul Hannon, as the secondary beneficiary, Would inherit Nicholas' share of Hannon Properties. NICK: Want to give me that in English, Mr. Keats? KEATS: This company is worth nearly $11 million, Nicholas. Your father left a set of rules you have to follow for two years or you lose your half. (SIGHS) I don't believe this, man. Six feet under, and he's still telling me what to do. You know, I never thought I'd hear myself say this. What's that? I actually miss the guy. Meeting's about to start. You gonna come? No. You go ahead. I'm kind of busy. Huh. You want this one? NICK: June, Ward and the Beaver. Is this for my mother's grave? PAUL: Let me see. Yeah. Your parents had adjoining plots. How romantic. Let me ask you something. Who the hell do you think paid for the upkeep of your mother's grave? Yeah, 'cause he felt guilty. You're damn right he felt guilty. And you act like he gave her that gun on purpose. Like he wanted her to kill herself? Maybe he did. Jesus Christ, Nick! That tore him apart! It hurt him so much, he couldn't even talk about it. Not to me, not to Kelly. No one, ever! Every chance you got, you just rubbed his nose in it, didn't you? What do you want me to do, Paul? You want me to say I'm sorry? No, I think it's a bit late for that, don't you? Do you know why he put that provision in the will? To force you to make something of your life. To force you to become a man. You know, my stepmother was pretty hot too. My father never knew it, but all I ever thought about was poking her. (LAUGHING) Kelly? You got a minute? Yes. Look, I've been thinking... Uh... I could just keep jerking around for the next couple of years and then sell my share of the company and take the cash. True. But that's not the way I want to go. I want to do it right. And do you think you could help me? Of course I will. You want to be nice to me? Then fix the water damage. And put in some new carpet and paint. Mr. Jackson, nothing is going to happen here until you pay the back rent. Promises have been made. You don't get my rent until they're kept. You want me to slap you with an eviction notice? You want the Marshal to come here and drag you out of here? Hey, hey, hey! Let's take a break here, all right? Can I just get a moment, please? Could I talk to you for a moment, Mr. Jackson? I don't see why not. Come on in. What'll it take to straighten this whole thing out? You put in new carpet and paint and I give you the back rent. Cash up front and then the work happens. Half now, the rest when it's done. All right. Deal. (LAUGHING) I'm very impressed. You handled that a lot better than your father would have. There's a compliment. He probably would've thrown the guy down the stairs and sued him for having bled on his property. Why is it so impossible for you to stop hating him? Why? (SCOFFS) T.J. Hannon, self-made millionaire... Deserted his wife and a 12-year-old son. He never looked back. Three years later, she blew her brains out. So don't expect me to be the model son. (GASPS) NICK: Stay here! You sick fuck! -Come on! Get out of the car, fucker! -Peace. You've got no witnesses to corroborate your story. No physical proof that he was even there. The best that I can do is get a restraining order. That's it? I'm afraid so. But once he's served with the papers, you let me know if he harasses you again before the trial. Because if he does, I'll throw him in jail. Jesus Christ, this guy is relentless! "I was out of the country. My deep condolences. "Love, Susan." KELLY: Hey, how's the traffic? MEREDITH: Oh, you don't want to know. How're you doing? Okay. How are you? Hey, man. How are you? Good. How are you? Hi. Hi. KELLY: Come on. Any bites? Are you using bait? Bait? I'm supposed to use bait? Come sit here. Here. Take your shirt off. Your shoulders are getting burned. PAUL: Hey! You guys want another one? You want some help? Um, some more ice. Somebody out there's in desperate need of cooling off. What do you mean? I mean they're getting awfully chummy, aren't they? You know, I don't know why you've never liked her. You said she would never sign a prenuptial, and she did. And you didn't think the marriage would be a good one, and it was. But yet you still blame her for Ted's death. Why don't you just get over it already? (LAUGHING) (SPLASHING) It's cold up there, huh? This is nice. Oh! Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I think you should find another place to stay. Yeah, I guess you're right. I... uh... Yeah. (SIGHS) Oh, God. Can I get you anything? No. I'm gonna take off in a minute. You forgot your coat. La petite mort... It's a French saying that means "the little death." It's that amazing moment right before you orgasm, when your heart stops and you can't breathe. The little death. This has to be our secret. Nobody can know. Okay? (SIGHS) (MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) BAILIFF: All rise. Be seated. The Hannons pleaded with Mr. Lomax to stop the endless harassment. But the defendant was relentless. He even continued to harass Mrs. Hannon after her husband's death. On the night of the murder, the defendant sent Mrs. Hannon a provocative piece of lingerie. Ted Hannon, being a man of honor, went to Mr. Lomax's apartment, unarmed, to resolve the matter peacefully. When he arrived, Mr. Lomax was laying in wait. Now, Mr. Lomax will claim that he was afraid for his life. But make no mistake about it, he was stalking his prey. Ladies and gentlemen, I am positive that when you hear all the evidence in this case, you will find Robert Lomax guilty of murder. Thank you very much. Robert Lomax regrets this unfortunate loss of life. But this is a classic case of self-defense. It is nothing more, and nothing less. And, um, when I heard all the noise, I peeked outside and I saw Mr. Hannon open Lomax's door. But the chain was on. Then you're saying that the door was unlocked? Yeah. Definitely. And then what happened? He kicked the door in and went inside. And a few seconds later, the gun went off. Once Mr. Hannon entered the apartment, did you hear the defendant say anything prior to the gunshot? No. Then you did not hear the defendant warn the victim? No, he didn't say a word. Was the victim armed? No. Was there anything on his person that might be construed as a weapon? No. Nothing. What was the distance between the defendant and the victim at the time of the shooting? According to the forensic report, about 10 feet. Would you say that's about the distance between us right now? Yeah. That's about right. Detective Snyder, in your fifteen years on the L.A. police force, have you ever heard of an unarmed man inflicting bodily injury from 10 feet away? Not in my experience. Then what did Mr. Hannon say? He said, "If you bother my wife again, I'll fucking kill you." Sorry, Judge. I'm familiar with the word. (LAUGHING) Is this it? Yeah. What's that? "Dear Claire, I'm very frustrated by your not letting me have contact with Nick. "I know you've probably poisoned him against me, but you're only hurting him. "You leave me no choice but to withhold alimony until you allow me to have a "relationship with my son. Sincerely, Ted." MAN: Will there be anything else, ma'am? No, thank you. I started working at Hannon Properties after I graduated college. And that's when you first met Ted Hannon? Yes. How long after that were you married? Two years. How long were you married? About three and a half years. In the five and a half years that you knew Ted Hannon, would you say that you knew him well? Very well. After the incident in the Cezanne restaurant, did you receive another gift from the defendant? Yes, the very next night. And what was your husband's response? He became extremely upset. Mrs. Hannon, what was your husband's intention when he went to the defendant's apartment that night? Objection. Speculation. It goes to state of mind, Your Honor. She is an expert witness who knew the victim intimately. She can answer. He went there to finally talk some sense into him. He didn't go there to try to hurt him, otherwise he would've brought a gun or something. I mean, you have to understand, this man was constantly harassing us. I tried time and time again to tell him to leave me alone! He is crazy! Objection. Your Honor, is there a question here? Sustained. Mrs. Hannon, please control yourself. Mrs. Hannon, each time Mr. Lomax sent you a gift, did you accept it? Yes. And you never refused? No, but I... So although you kept telling him you were married, you kept accepting his gifts, correct? Yes, but I didn't... A simple yes or no will suffice, thank you. According to your February phone bill, you placed a phone call to Mr. Lomax on the evening of your husband's death. Is that correct? Yes. And isn't it true that you called Mr. Lomax because you believed that your husband was going to harm him? No. No? Well, then can you possibly explain the purpose of that phone call? To let him have it. To tell him off for his repulsive behavior. To tell him again to leave me alone. I see. No further questions. JUDGE: The witness can step down. We're close to lunch. We will recess and come back at 2:00. All rise. Thank you. Thanks. You're welcome. (SIGHS) I don't like what you're doing. What do you mean? I mean you and Kelly. I don't know what you're talking about. Come on, she's your stepmother for God sakes. I mean, I know you never had any respect for your father, but she should know better. Listen, Paul... Are you screwing her just to get back at Daddy? Is that what this is all about? What did he say to you? Forget it. He's such an asshole sometimes. Are you all right? Yeah. Well, I think it's time I tell you something about your uncle Paul. I've never told anyone this. And you have to promise me you won't tell anyone, especially Meredith. All right. When I was engaged to your father, Paul came on to me. More than once. (SIGHS) I refused, of course, but... Basically, he's had it in for me ever since. What was your reaction to Mr. Hannon showing up at your apartment? My reaction was I was afraid. He was beating on the door and screaming like he was a madman. What happened then? Well, he kicked the door in. I told him to get out, but he continued screaming at me, and he started towards me. Mr. Lomax, what did you do? I guess I panicked. I know I reached for the gun, and I warned him to stop. Then I remember calling the police. We've heard testimony that Mr. Hannon threatened to kill you at the Cezanne restaurant. But was there anything else that led you to believe that your life was in danger? Mrs. Hannon called me just before her husband got there. What did she say? She said that he was on his way over there to tear me apart. I needed to get out. But, Mr. Lomax, isn't that in direct conflict with Mrs. Hannon's testimony? She lied. Mr. Lomax, do you own an answering machine? Yeah. Yes. And if I were in the process of leaving a message, and you picked up the phone, the machine would cut off, correct? No. It's voice activated. What does voice activated mean, Mr. Lomax? It means if you and I are having a conversation, the machine keeps recording until our conversation's finished. Your Honor, at this time, I would like to enter into evidence a cassette taken from Mr. Lomax's answering machine on the evening of February 13th. If it pleases the court, I would like to... Objection, Your Honor. The people have not had an opportunity to hear this tape, and won't stipulate to the authenticity of it. Duly noted. I'll allow it. This is Kelly Hannon. LOMAX: Don't hang up. Lomax? Yeah. KELLY: Listen, I don't know what kind of game you're playing, but this is gonna stop. LOMAX: What do you mean? KELLY: The lingerie was not a very good idea, you sick bastard. My husband's on his way over there right now, and he's gonna tear your head off. Now, I don't want him getting in trouble over a pathetic loser like you. So I suggest that you get the hell out of there right now! No further questions. Is this your gun, Mr. Lomax? Yes. It is. Is this the weapon that you used to defend yourself against the unarmed Ted Hannon? At the time, I wasn't sure... A simple yes or no will be sufficient. Yes. Yes. You'll be all right. JUDGE: Has the jury reached a verdict? We have, Your Honor. Will the defendant please rise? "In the matter of the State of California versus Robert E. Lomax, "the jury finds the defendant not guilty of the crime of murder as charged." JUDGE: Mr. Lomax, you are free to go. (CROWD MURMURING) Come on, let's go. I'm gonna run out to the store. Get some milk. I won't be long. Okey-dokey. (OPERA MUSIC BEGINS TO PLAY) Nick? Nick? Nick. (GASPS) Good morning, Kelly. Let's have a little wine, Kelly. Or do you want some of this first, huh? (GRUNTING) Slow the fuck down, Bobby! Are you a goddamn moron? What the hell are you doing here? Maybe I am a moron. What the hell are you doing here, Kelly, huh? What, did you have me kill your husband so you could fuck his son? That's sick. I am not fucking him. He is my stepson! Oh, really? Bobby. Bobby. Kill my husband, Bobby. If I leave him, I don't get nothing, Bobby. We'll live like kings together on his money, Bobby. That's right, Bobby. And you're gonna blow it unless you get the hell out of here right now. Hey! I just killed a man over you! And you repay me by fucking his kid? Huh? He is my friend. Now, I just lost my husband, remember? Now listen, I want you to meet me here next Friday. Okay? What are you gonna wear, Kelly? You'll see. (GASPS) Ow! He better not be fucking you. Ah! (ENGINE REVVING) (GRUNTS) (GROANING) I don't give a shit, Detective Snyder. I don't care if he doesn't own a Jeep. He could've rented it or borrowed it, stolen it. Come on! You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go get a gun, and I'm gonna shoot the prick if he comes near my house. All right? (DOOR CLOSES) (SCOFFS) (KEYS JANGLING) You fucking murderer! (GRUNTING) (GROANS) God damn it, you say she's not yours, man. I fucked her. Did you? (GRUNTS) Say it, or I'll fucking kill you! I fucked her. Did you? (CAR APPROACHES) Is he dead? No. Sure as hell scared him, though. (SIGHS) You're a hard man to get a hold of. (CLEARS THROAT) Yeah. I've been busy. Yeah. Do you mind if I sit down? So, how long are we gonna do this? Do what? All right, Nick, I stuck my nose where it shouldn't have been. And I'm sorry. Look, you're a goddamn hypocrite, Paul. What are you talking about? Why'd you give me this big speech about morality? You're the one that came on to her. I came on to whom? Kelly. What? When? When she was engaged to Dad. Did she tell you that? That's bullshit. Nicky, she's a liar. It never happened. I swear on my brother's grave. You've been a very bad boy, Bobby. What've you been, Kelly? I've been good. I don't think so. Come here. Come here. You know, we probably ought to just buy that boat that guy's got down in Cabo. What, with all this money, we ought to just buy the whole goddamn marina. I'm sorry, Bobby. (GUN FIRES) (GROANS) (GROANS) Mrs. Hannon? Let's do the exam, sweetie. Let me help you. Lay back. It was definitely a rape. His semen is inside her. Her skin is under his fingernails. Excuse me, sir? Kelly. (SOBBING) And why did you go to the beach house today, Mrs. Hannon? Last week, when we were up there, Nick gave me a pair of earrings. And this morning I couldn't find one. And I went there to look for it. I know this is difficult, but can you tell me what happened? I was in the bedroom, and I found the earring. And as I went to leave, he was standing in the doorway, and grabbed me. And he put a knife to my throat. I thought he was gonna kill me. But he threw me on the bed and he raped me. After he came, he rolled off me and I managed to get the gun. Where was the gun? Right beside the bed in the nightstand. You know, the gun was illegal. The serial numbers had been scratched off. Where did you get it? My husband gave it to me. He thought the beach house was too isolated and that I would have some protection if I was by myself. That's all I'll need right now, Mrs. Hannon. Thank you. What about my car? Don't worry about it. I'll send someone from the office to go get it. So, when did Dad give you that gun? About a year ago. Why? No reason. I'm just glad he did. Lomax. I'm gonna go get your prescription. Do you want anything else? We'll be okay, won't we? Do you work here? Yeah. Uh... I was wondering if you'd do me a favor. It'd really help me out if I could take a look at some of the old records. I'll have to talk to my boss. Is he here? Yeah. Can you get him? Sure. There's a guy over there that wants to talk to you. Here he is. Hey, man. What are you doing? (GASPS) Oh, my God, you scared me. Where have you been? I've been worried sick. What's wrong? My father would've never, ever given you a gun. Jesus, Kelly, you killed him. Stop this, Nick. What are you doing? You've known Lomax for years. That's crazy! Explain this. Come on! Explain it to me! I could've gone, Nick. I could've taken all that cash and split. But I didn't. You kept me here. Now stop this. This is the sickest thing I've ever heard. No. Come here. Nick. Nick, what are you doing? Don't you move. Send somebody to 547 Scarlet Street, please. Yeah. I need to report a murder. Just get here! Kelly? Kelly. Kelly. (SOBBING) I can't go to jail. I loved you, Nick. No! No! No!
