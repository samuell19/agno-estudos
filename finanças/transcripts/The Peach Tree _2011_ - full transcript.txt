Some people will see them as monsters and know them as monsters. They will become a fearful subjects only because they look different from others. Why is that? Maybe their appearance could just be our appearance. Once upon a time, believe it or not, It really happened long long time ago. Once upon a time, there was a couple who raised a big tree just as if it's their own child. Every Spring, the big tree had a pink fruit. The fruit looked like a peach so the couple started to call the big tree a "peachtree" eeeya! Then one day, the couple conceived a real baby. Thank you for coming all the way to see me, sister. I should have made the visit. It's ok, how could you travel in such condition? It really looks like a peach What? I think a baby that looks like a peach will be born. The couple under the big tree is expecting a baby peach with a growing cheek, foot, buttocks, that is pink colored. Is it over? Is it a boy? Or a girl? Sweatheart! Si-yeon, Si-yeon, Si-yeon Let me go! Si-yeon~ you can't do this! I'm gonna kill him Si-yeon I'm gonna kill IT No! No! Si-yeon! Si-yeon! No! Please! Don't do this please! Take Care. When my wife gets better, I will come visit. See you later. You can't close the door like this. You are his mother. You can't be ashamed of the truth. You can't think of it as misfortune either. Si-yeon, you are his mother! 10 years later With operation, Dong-hyun can live a normal life. All of his vitals are normal. That means we have to get rid of Sang-hyun? Sang-hyun will die eventually. I know it's a hard decision But at least one child should live a normal life before he gets more emotional damage. Before he grows any older. Make the decision. Hello, Hello, Hello I think mom will yell at us again today. I rather hope she doesn't recognize us again today. Mom is too scary. What I meant was… Dong-hyun! You should say hello to your mom, you practiced this before. I'm scared. This boy is Dong-hyun Dong-hyun Choi Wait a second Dong-hyun! And this boy is Sang-hyun Sang-hyun Choi Thank you for coming all the way here. You must have gone through a lot of trouble. It's mom who I have yearned for. Hey Dong-hyun, Mom just offered her hand. Monster Monster It's mom. It's mom. Get out! All of you! Get out All of you! Get out It's mom. It's mom who I wanted to see. You are my small peachtree. I will always love you. You are my small peachtree. Always love us Where can you let out? Don't cry. My love is here in the bright moon. I dreamt. It was a dream of reading my mother's last letter. Please cover my head, my little peach That was heaven. That was the day… when I last saw my mother. And also the first and last time singing it to my mother. In the end, she just wrote one letter and passed away. I've always thought that my mother's death was because of me. After my mother passed away, we had to learn how to do everything together. We always tried to like the same things We always trained to think and feel alike. We always had to live by the rules Also, we had to control everything On weekends, we could have receive new books with the help of Tae-sung. Dong-hyun dreamed of the outer world by reading many books, and through the books he wanted to become a writer that writes many books. Dad wanted to give Dong-hyun a big world as a gift to him. We couldn't do anything. Like that we became adults. A very different kind of…adult. It's like dividing every single cells into half. Then, the half automatically grows and fills up the rest. What do you think Sang-hyun? I don't know. You wouldn't know. There's nothing wrong. Where are you going? I asked you to help me with the store. I love you! I love you my friend. Forget it! You only say we are friends. I'll be back I'm so tired, Seung-ah. I'm gonna take a break. Have fun. Ok. Thank you for giving me the opportunity. Thank you very much for giving me the opportunity. Good job Seung-ah I will call you when I see something good. Ok. Thank you! Hello Ms. Yoon. I guess you were busy, it was so hard to get in touch with you. It's about Ms. Jeong-ae's photo-essay book publishing. I'll be planning the publication. I haven't got your latest copy of your work yet. Oh Ms. Seung-ah. Yes? Oh here it is! I found it! It's a baby picture, right? But I guess the image wasn't properly scanned. There are two faces overlapped. Two baby photos. Ok, I will check and get back to you soon. Thank you Ms. Yoon. Good bye. Hey! It doesn't fit right. Hey! Park Seung-ah! It's all your fault! What did the Mannaquins do wrong? Just because you got laid off doesn't mean their heads also have to get chopped off. It's not that, if you want the clothes to stand out it's better not to have the face on the mannaquins. This is real my lovely friend? Thank you my lovely friend. You are my worst enemy. Welcome! Oh you came back. My lovely friend! This is actually you being hysterical everytime you get laid off from the publishing companies. But don't you think this time you went too far? How could you chop off the head of my only him. What will I do? I'm telling you if your sweatheart doesn't have a head your sales will go up. My lovely friend, is appearance that important? Of course it is important. Appearance is essential. This is reality. So, we have no other choice than to live like this for others No, for you brother. There is no other option I know. You Know? Yeah. But why are you always going back to the point as if it's my thought... - I make it think that I want it. - Hey, Dong-hyun. I don't know well, but I hope that is the best for you. Then, please stay out of this. That is what you can do for me. I told you to stay out. Dong-hyun. It's not a bad copy. Tae-sung exchanged it to a new book. I am sick of those books. You don't know what I want. That night Manilla took Ann to the bed and spoke to her firmly. "Ann, last night you took off your clothes and threw them on the floor making a mess. I can't stand the mess... "When you take off your clothes, please fold them neatly and put it on the chair". Because a girl that is not neat has no use. What kind of writing does Dong-hyun usually write? I don't know well. What kind of books does Dong-hyun like? I don't know well. I think realistic books. Realistic pictures… Realistic…pictures? Picture books? Are you talking about photos or illustrations? Did Dong-hyun ever need help on those field? Did Dong-hyun ever tell you that? I don't really... really know. Ok. Forget it. I guess he needs someone to help him. I have to find someone to help him. Hey, Sang-hyun. You shouldn't be worrying about other things. Dad, I... I thought it was because of me. I told you to stay out and pretend like you don't know. Something I can do myself? You think there will be any difference? Don' be a fool. That night my dad looked so tired. And I felt strongly that he was because of me. I guess he needs someone to help him. Sang-hyun please don't worry about other things too. When will the sale go up? Give me back my sweatheart's head. It rained today. I hope it rains money. Hmmm.. It's done. Ok~ oh my god.. Oh my… you scared me! I think he is coming in. Welcome… I… Excuse me, I just want to ask something Yeah sure. Go ahead. About thirty years ago, in this spot… there was a photo store Would you happen to know where they moved? We are only in our twenties. Oh.. Sorry. I'm very sorry. I will leave now. Good bye. Here you go. Thank you. I don't think there are any photo stores in this neighborhood. Is it urgent? Good bye. What was that? He scared me. Was there a photo store in this neighborhood? Who cares. A photo store 30 years ago? Don't you think that man has a strange character? You should draw a character like him. Who knows, the publisher might like it, right? Seung-ah? Seung-ah? Thank you for giving me a ride. I think it's amazing. There used to be a photo store here. I didn't know. Who was the owner? Was it owned by a famous person? It.. was owned by my dead wife's acquaintance. Oh. I see. I guess you haven't met her since then. She had a disability, she couldn't speak. Oh dear. Oh~ I see. I think you will meet her eventually. They say if people are destined to meet they will all eventually meet. Thank you. If you don't mind me asking, what kind of sketch work do you do these days? Oh this? This is a caricature. I used to work for a publishing company. It's a monthly cartoon. A publishing company? Yes. Here you go. It's my gift to you. It's to cheer you up. Oh… oh thank you I think I can get off at the next light. It will be faster to walk from there. Ok. I have one son. He is about your age. He was born with a disability… so he could not relate to the outside world. Oh… dear. That's too bad. It's like Agoraphobia. Everybody has some sort of disability. The woman you who you are looking for, and your son too but I also have Do you think… I look normal?! Thank you very much for today. Wait… My son wants to become a writer. I want to help him with his dream. If he can publish a book that would be a dream come true. Ok… I understand. I know it's a lot to ask from you… but Can you help him out? A small illustration to go with the writing perhaps? Illust… Oh Mr… the truth is I didn't get a formal education on illustration… and also I just got unemployed… I also have to help out with the store… I will pay whatever you want. What? Only a week, a week will do. Please help him. Please. Please follow me. Ok. You must be tired from the trip. Please take a rest now… Where is your son? I should say hello to him. It's ok. You don't have to. You probably have to get started early in the morning. Please take some rest. Ok. Ok. Thank you. Thank you, Wait a second. Ok She came. On a dark night. Riding a black car. Into the dark. She came. And I… and I have to be patient with the darkness that will be faced upon me. Hello. Hello. My name is Dong-hyun Choi Hello, my name is Dong-hyun Choi. Oh.. I like to wear a hat. Wow~ Oh, Hello. My name is Seung-ah Park. Nice to meet you. Ah… I'm too embarrassed I'm going to go insane. Girls are prettier than I thought. They are not scary as mom. They are pretty. Pretty like mom. I'm going to sleep, don't talk to me. I was really suffocated. Hello. My name is Seung-ah Park. Nice to meet you. Oh.. can you.. Play it for me a little more? It was very pleasant to here you play. You woke up early. Oh dear, We don't have much time left. What should we get started today? I just wanted to tell a story of ordinary people. I guess ordinary people living double lives aren't that much different from what their lives are like. It's a little weird. But it looks like this. I just wanted to tell a story of someone like this. Oh! How come I never thought about this before? This character surely can express variety of emotions. It was a very difficult journey. To come to this point. Someone will see them as monster and know them as monster. They will become a fearful object only because their appearance looks different from others. Why is that? Maybe it could be that their appearance is our appearance. Excuse me. How can I help you today? Seung-ah is staying at my house. What? She will be staying there for a while. I came here to get her clothes. Oh... what? Can you please get me her clothes? You have to do things that you don't like. You have to go to places that you don't like. You have to smell things that you don't like, and you have to eat things that you don't like. Because two of us share one body. But… I guess there will be a lot of conflict because there are two personalities. It's a little sad. The one behind him. What would be the life of that other individual? You can't die even though you want to. I'm just saying. It feels to me it won't be fair to one person. It will be the same for both of them. Because not having a personal life is the same for this person. It always feels like someone is watching you. Well at least they won't be lonely. People are…born lonely animals…. I guess they maybe god's blessing. But… Why is the person in behind more handsome? Ah~ Because freedom is here this person at least should be handsome. That way it's fair. I think it will be less aggrevated. Can you please re-draw it? Please re-draw it to make the person in front more handsome. That way it's funny. Oh… really? I feel sleepy. I'm gonna take a walk. Oh… This is Dong-hyun's room. I should leave. Is that you Cheol-min? Cheol-min… Looks like a picture of his wife. She is beautiful. Oh Cheol-min, you scared me. Oh I'm sorry, I was just looking around the house and came all the way down here. Did you go somewhere? I went to the clothing store where you work. Because You came here in a hurry, you couldn't bring your clothes? I asked your friend to pack some of your clothes. Oh~ oh Dear~ Oh, Cheol-min, you didn't have to do this for me. Oh, , actually I really leave tomorrow. If I get kicked out from my weekend part-time job, I'm finished. Wait, You didn't see anything? What? No, nevermind. Give it to me. I will put it in your room. Oh ok. Thank you. What are you doing? Oh, you scared me. I mean… Why are you so surprised? I have to leave early in the morning tomorrow. Then, you would have to… wake up early… Right. Right. I would have to wake up early. Then go ahead and sleep now. Ah. Yeah. Ok. I will go to bed now. Good night Dong-hyun. Good night. I took her brooch. As told by the lady I took the brooch. When I entered the room, I didn't mean to take it. But the brooch was so beautiful… when I put it on my chest Oh no… where is it? What? Dong-hyun, are you sleeping? No. Wait.. Wait a second. Ok. Oh, hey,. I'm sorry I woke you up at this hour. I lost my ID. I really need it, can you help me find it? Oh…that. Oh that I was in this room earlier. The door was open… I'm sorry… No… that… That… I will look for it. Ok…Ok Wait a minute. Ok. You can't find it? Wait a minute. I'm still searching. I don't think it's here. Oh~ When the light comes out I will look for it again. Is that… urgent? Tomorrow is… pay day for the amusement park. But… I'm sure there's another way.. So… I'm sorry. No it's not a problem Ok then I will go back to bed now. Yes. I'm sorry to bother you again I'm sorry. It's just that I think I should get your writing now. I'm going to the publisher tomorrow. Oh. Ok. Wait a minute. Ok Oh.. Actually… I'm a little bit embarrassed Thank you for your time. No Problem. Please wait for it to get published. Left hand? Right hand It's a very awkward handshake. You did a good job. Good night. Good night. So you're saying you followed him and drew this and came back. You. Yeah, Cheol-min said his son has a disability. It is gross. Hey, he seems like he was gonna get your underwears too. Anyway, I really don't like that guy. He is a good guy. Hello, this is Cho Seo Hyung at Korea publishing company. Hello Mr. Cho. My name is Seung-ah Park. Oh it's been a while Ms. Seung-ah Park. Hello. Oh, no. I found it. Here it is. Can I trust you? What is this? What happened to you all of sudden? I'm sorry? Why couldn't you do your work like this before? What happen? It's beyond my expectation. Let us get started with the interview first. We can think about publishing it. Who's the writer? Oh. It's my friend. Welcome. I was always worried about him. Dong-hyun… Without Sang-hyun, he would've been a normal child. He is trying to change. He is changing. Dong-hyun! Here you are. Thank you. Dong-hyun? Take a seat. I'm looking for this person. Oh, Seung-ah! Oh, she was looking for her ID for a long time. I will go and look for her. Excuse me, I'm sorry. Excuse me. Excuse me. I'm sorry. Excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Dong-hyun! Hello. Huh? I am Shin-eui Kang, manager from Korea publishing company. How did you…. I came here to interview the writer. I heard a lot from Ms. Seung-ah Park. I will be in charge of Dong-hyun Choi's publishing. Is he not here? Oh no… it's not that… Wait a minute here, and I will get Dong-hyun for you. Hey Seung-ah! A lot of people were looking for you today. That guy was here again. Oh! You should call your manager right now and Mr. Cho too. They called here couple times. Seung-ah! Can you hear me? Hey! Hello? This is Seo-hyung Cho from Korea Publishing Company. Hello Mr. Cho. It's me Seung-ah Park. I heard my manager called me. Oh she sent to interview the writer. Hello? Seung-ah? Seung-ah? Hello? Mr. Dong-hyun Choi? Wait.. I'm sorry Wait a minute. If you could give us some time to think about it… The writing is so good. It's a shame to have this talent unnoticed. Don't worry about other things and leave it to me. I will make sure to protect Dong-hyun's privacy. I know what your concern is very well. But… Think about it carefully. It's all for your son. Won't you allow it? Don't hide anymore. It's time that he came out to the world. Hey, can you standstill for a minute? Oh no! He is running away. Get him! Mr. Dong-hyun Choi, please look over here. Here. Mr. Dong-hyun Choi Why don't you take his hat off. Oh Oh!! What is that? Mr. Dong-hyun Choi please look over here. Mr. Dong-hyun Choi, can you please turn your face around. Your face. Here, look over here. A little bit to over here. Can you please turn your face around? Mr. Dong-hyun Choi, Turn your face A little bit more. A little bit more. Get out, Get out. Please get out.. Please get out of here. Get out. Are you ok? Are you ok? Please get out. Get out of here. Get out of here. Get out of here. Get out! Get Out! Get Out! Get Out! Get Out! Get Out! Oh! What the!? I hope you take care of it well… Why couldn't you let us live as it is… Get used to the life… Why did you do this? Were you that embarassed of me? Tell me! Wasn't it you dad… Who really thought of me as a monster? I wanna get the surgery. You thought I didn't know anything? I knew it from the beginning. I could've had a normal life. So, please separate me! Right now, you didn't want to hit my brother right? But you saw how we both got hit? Does this look happy to you dad? Does this look happy to you? Please let me live! It's mom. Please let me live! I wanted to confess. Since, when I was young I was happy when you were crying I looked at the sky and the ocean endlessly. I always had to follow you in life. If my mind wasn't selfish, I couldn't bear it. I couldn't die when I wanted to. I wanted to confess that. Stop. Stop. It's a pain that the mass audience wants. We should do a good marketing. I have one photographer as a client. Jeong-ae. You know her right? She is looking for a person for her new piece. The tile of this photograph is Peach. The children's book you brought to me is " The Peachtree" It's so funny to be a coincidence. Let's give it to the press first and gain attention. I think that's important. But… The photograph we got only shows one person. I hope you can help us. Seung-ah. Can you provide us with one good photograph? Is that really necessary? I thought Mr. Dong-hyun Choi wanted his book to be published? I should set up a meeting with him and photographer Jeong-ae. You said he is your friend… Oh! Seung-ah! Are you coming back from the publisher's office? Are you done looking? She says thank you. No problem. Have a nice day! Seung ah Park You are hiding something from me right? I hate that guy I trust him only because you say so. It's because you. You said he is your friend. I'm going home. On the road everywhere there was a beam of light, but under the colored leaves… it was already turning dark like a clear transparent wine under the fir tree purple lighted spider came down. On a dark night, with the dark shadow, she came back to the darkness. You won't be lonely… Because you are together… Because you are together, I thought that you can get many consolation. You are a blessing. At least you are a blessing in my life. I came here to say that. You must like children books. I guess Dong-hyun wrote a children's book because of his brother. Did you know? I've known it all. Way before she came. I gotta go now. Wait. I don't know well but when we were born… they said we were like a peach. Cheek, foot, and buttocks They all looked like a peach. I am not sure but I heard peaches will grow soon. Will you come back then? I want to see it together. Ok. Sure, let's watch them together. Oh~ Someone will see them as monster, and know them as monster. Because only their appearance look different from the rest of us, they become subject of fear. Why is that? Their appearance…maybe… just could be our appearance. Seung-ah. You think she will come? I told you not to say a word and hold still. Dong-hyun! Why? When we were young, we were running away from mom and climbed up to that tree. On that day I saw her face as much as wanted to. Mom…She smiled.. Beautifully. Brother. I… I really hated you. Living like this I felt it was all because of you. But… everytime I felt like this, I made a promise to live. That was also all because of you. Everything felt like it was my fault. And really it was my fault. It's a miracle that they lived up to now I guess Dong-hyun knows what kept Sang-hyun alive to this day. They probably wanted to protect each other. Please let him rest in peace. Is this all left of Sang-hyun? Nothing else that he can take? Hey Seung-ah! Seung-ah! What's wrong? What's wrong? Seung-ah! Why? Hey Seung-ah! Sang-hyun, what do you like? Do you like to write? Do you like to read? What book do you like? Sang-hyun, What do you like? Here… Take this with you. And in your next life, don't forget to bring it with you. Would you know my small heart? I love you. Can't I touch you? Would you know my little body? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Can't I touch you? I love you. I'm sorry. Brother…I'm sorry… Believe it or not it happened once upon a time. Wow! It's time to go now. I'm sorry. Did he cause any trouble? That's ok. I am sorry I can't give this to you. This is a gift for someone else. Let's go! I heard you haven't seen it yet. Here. Take a look. I wasn't going to see it. I didn't want to see it. I was arrogant to my brother, was mad at him.. If I look at the book I will be embarrassed. Should I still see it? My brother said he saw my mom that day. He said my mom smiled. My mom was very pretty when she smiled. But the truth is it wasn't him who saw it. But it was me. My mom smiling. It was me who saw it. But how would have my brother know that my mom was smiling? It's mom!
