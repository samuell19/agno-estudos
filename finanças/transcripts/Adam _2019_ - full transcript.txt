- Hello. - Hello. I'm looking for work. I'm just passing through. Got any experience? I've been a hairdresser 5 years. What can you do? I can do colouring, highlights, blow-drying... Hairstyles, makeup, pedicures? Yes, everything... Can you work in your condition? Yes, I can. Fine. Tomorrow, 8 am. We'll talk salary if it works out. Can I sleep over there? You won't even notice me. This is a place of business. Not a hotel. Listen, you better go look somewhere else. - Hello. - Hello. Do you need a housemaid? No, my husband and I live alone. I'm good at cleaning. I really don't need it. You'd have nothing to do. Please... I wish I could help you. May God give you an easy birth. Sorry. I can cook, clean, do laundry... Anything you want. - Hello, Madam. - Hello. Can I help you? I'm looking for a job... I cook, clean... I can take care of your husband... No, thank you. Hey, miss! Miss! I'm here... Up here! What's your name? Samia. Wait, I'll come down and open the door. - Hello. - Hello. I'm looking for work. I don't need any help. Who was it? Nobody. Just a woman looking for work. But don't you need any help? No. I don't need anyone. What do you want for snack? A msemen. Honey or chocolate? - Chocolate. - Okay. Here. Go upstairs and finish your homework. Okay. No, it's spelled with a closed "t." Why? Because it's a noun, not a verb. Like this? Close the "t" a bit more... Do you plan to spend the night in front of my house? No. I'll go find a place to sleep. Come on, get up. Hurry, I'm not going to wait all night. Get back to bed. I won't bother you. My daughter eats breakfast here at 7:30. - Don't make me wake you up. - I can prepare it. No need, thank you. Good night. Good morning. Warda, come quick and have breakfast! My name is Warda, like the singer. Mum adores her. I said quick! You're late. I wanted to thank you. I can help you. I know how to... No need to help me. You can just leave. I'll let you stay here 2 or 3 days, then you can go back home, or find the guy who got you pregnant. - It's not what you think. - I don't want to know. About you or about your life. Hello Abla, two msemen, please. They're not ready yet. Come back later. Okay. People around here talk. I don't want problems. Dinner is at 8 o'clock. Before that, Warda does homework, and I'm busy. It's me, Samia. I couldn't hear you... Samia! How's it going? Good, what about you? I'm fine, thank God. I met your mother at the market this morning... Really? Is she well? Yes, fine. Just overwhelmed, as usual... - And my father, how is he? - Fine... He's well. Fatna, tell them that I tried to reach them but I couldn't get through, okay? Yes, they still haven't come to replace that damn antenna. Tell them everything is going well for me at work. I have lots of clients. Everyone asks for me at the salon. Great. Soon I'll have vacation and I'll come visit them. I might even stay home for good, if I've saved up enough money. Fatna, please tell them my phone is broken. I'll call when it's fixed. Don't worry. I'll go tell them later. I have to get back to work. Okay, bye. Goodbye. Take care. - Abla, hello. - Hello, Milouda. Two msemen, please. - How are you? How's your husband? - Fine. But his days are numbered. Here. Just the way he likes them, soft and fluffy. I just pray he eats something. - Hopefully. - Good luck, my dear. What do you want in it? Cheese and turkey. - Here or to go? - To go. - And a Raibi, please. - Okay. You're eating for two now! Boy or girl? I don't know. Better that way. Like our mothers. They didn't care to know. Have you finished your math? Yes. You didn't look very focused today. I was focused, Mum. You know it's important for your average. Yes, Mum. You must put in the effort. Discipline and perseverance. Yes, you're right. I'll try harder. Did you pack your schoolbag for tomorrow? Yes. - You haven't forgotten anything? - Nothing. Did your baby like the meatballs? I don't know. What will you name it? Warda! Stop, that's none of your business. Hello, Abla. How are you? Can I borrow your remote? My soap opera is starting, and my damn remote won't work. Usually, I just tap it and it's okay. Who is she? My cousin from Meknes. She's here for a few days. Fatima's daughter? No, Zhor's. Fatima only has sons. I thought Zhor's daughters were old. Too old to have kids, I mean. Well, I don't want to miss the beginning. Mum... Yes? Did you have a big belly like Samia's when I was inside? Like all women. And was I a pretty baby? You have school tomorrow. You should sleep. Good morning. I told you not to do anything in my house. I just wanted to help. Wow, rziza! I love rziza! Sit down and eat properly. This rziza isn't bad. I don't make it anymore. It takes too much time. And the machine-made rziza isn't as good. It's too thick, it doesn't taste the same. I made about thirty, so you can sell them. Look... Look, a moustache! - You've got rziza today. - Yes. I'll take two, and two home-made breads. Coming right up. Here. - How much? - 10 dirhams. One bread, please. Hello. Hello. - Thank you. - Thanks. Hello. One harcha and three msemen. Is the rziza home-made? - Yes. - I'll take three. Sure. Here you are. This is the last one, and I got it! Really? Mum sold them all. Really? But don't tell her I told you. - I won't say a thing. - Promise? Yes! Know what we'll do? - What? - Make more rziza! Want to help? - Yes. - Let's go. You see? You run it through your fingers. It must be as fine as possible. Stretch it out here, it's still thick. Stretch without pressing... My grandmother taught me to make rziza. I was still little, like you. That's right. See the spots that are still thick? They have to become very thin. See? And now, we roll it. This will be a small one. Like this. Now, we take it off. See? There we go. It's a tiny one. Now we add oil and butter, and flatten it. Coming. I made some more rziza. In case you've run out. Okay. I'll let you give me a hand. Just for a few days. Put them there. - Hello. - Hello. - Two harcha and two rziza. - Okay. Here. - Thank you. - Goodbye. Hello. Hello. It's fine, Slimani. Thanks. Need anything else? No, not for now. Tell your father to send this month's bill, so I can pay it. That blue looks nice on you. It's not blue, it's grey. Alright, goodbye. Goodbye. I don't understand this flour. Look. I'm sure it's not pure. t can't be. Look... The local women should protest in front of their factory. Show them we're not fools. Right? What are you doing? Just rubbing oil on my belly, because it pulls and itches. Good night. No, don't leave. Can I touch it? Okay. Your belly is like an egg. It's moving. Put your hand here! Do you feel it? It's kicking. It just kicked me. Touch. It's moving. Can you feel it? It just kicked me too! If you're a boy, kick twice. If you're a girl, kick once. How many kicks? Only one. - Girl or boy? - Girl. It didn't kick. It's not kicking. - Yes, it is. - No, that was you. Go to sleep. I just got up to pee. And you're leaving in the morning. Mum. Where's Samia? Her husband came for her. She went back to her village. I'm going downstairs, the store's unlocked. Come get your snack. You're lying! Don't talk to me that way. You're a monster. You have no heart! Hold on! Fez! Fez! Fez! Come on, hurry up! Get in! I'll give you a good price. You want a ticket? Samia! Where are you going? None of your business. Come on, let's go home. I'm not going. Please, Samia. Do you need anything? No, thank you. I'll leave in a few days. I'm trying to figure something out. How? I'll find a way. I'm giving the child up as soon as it's born. And I'll go back to my parents' house. You won't give birth in the street. Your child will be born here. You'll leave after. Good night. Damn oven, always breaking down! I've had it! - I'll use the public oven. - That's alright, I'll go. Are you sure? I could use some fresh air. Okay. - Hello. - Hello. I'll take that. - I'm in a hurry. - Okay, ma'am. Here, have a seat. Thank you. What about us? I've been standing a long time. Are you pregnant? It's very easy to get knocked up on the streets and have people be nice to you... What's wrong? Are you okay? Yes, I'm fine. Don't you want to go rest? I'd rather stay here. Good evening. Anyone here? Good evening. Is Abla here? Yes. But actually no, she's taking a nap. A nap? Yes, a nap. That's strange. Abla never naps. Is she sick? No, just tired. Maybe she has a fever, and you don't know it. I'll go get her some medicine. You know what? Go check on her, without waking her up. Gently touch her forehead, and come tell me. I'll be waiting. I swear she's fine. I told her to go rest. You're sure? Positive. You're her cousin, right? You can talk to her, woman to woman... Tell her I'm a good guy, with serious intentions. I'm not too shabby. Look. Plus, I won't lose any more hair than this. She knows my father. He's 70, and he's not bald. Mum! Hi, Slimani. Hi, little flower. Your mother's resting. Go upstairs to her. Okay. What I like about Abla is her courage. She's a fighter. There aren't many like her. If she gave me a chance, I wouldn't let her down. You can go home. She's fine. I promise. Thank you. Good night. I feel good When you're with me I feel good Because you're my world, my universe I feel good Because you're with me You better turn that off or Mom's going to be very angry. You told me she loved Warda. Yes, but she hasn't listened to her since Dad died. Call Samia, dinner is almost ready. Come have dinner! I'm not hungry, eat. You're not hungry, but your baby is. I know it. Come on, catch me! Get over here. Come back here, Warda! You're too fat to run! Just you watch! Hey! Where are you going? I'm leaving! Come here. You can't catch me, you're too fat! - Little brat! - You're too fat! Come! You didn't tell me about your test. What? Did it go well? Yes. Was it the lesson you studied? Yes, Mum. - Hello. - Hello. How are you? Is Abla here? Hello. Abla, how are you? I'll have a msemen with cheese. Thanks. - What did you want on it? - Cheese. Put the show back on, please. You're not listening. This is more cheerful. No, put the show back on. Goodbye. Turn that off. I won't turn it off. Turn it off now. No. I said turn it off! You're going to listen. When we met, he played that song all the time. He knew the effect it had on me. The lyrics were so beautiful. They still are. I often listened to it, while waiting for him. It made me feel... closer to him. That night he came home late from fishing. I was so eager to see him. We had dinner. We laughed. He teased me because I burned my tajine. And then came the phone call. He had to go back to the port to deal with a problem. He got dressed, and left. Thirty minutes... Thirty minutes, he said. Thirty minutes and I'll be back. They brought me his body the next morning. A stupid accident. Before I knew it, the house... was full of people. Neighbours, family... In every corner. Everything had to be done quickly. They had to prepare him and bury him by prayer time. I didn't even have a chance to touch him, kiss him, smell him one last time. They took him and buried him, his body still warm. And I wasn't even allowed to see him to his grave. Death does not belong to women. Few things really belong to us. It's going to be a boy. You have a cone-shaped belly. It doesn't matter, it doesn't belong to me. I want it to have a good family, who'll care for it... I want it to have a future. Are you sure you want to do this? Sarnia, if you give it away there's no going back. What else can I do? Let it be born a bastard? A child of sin? Make it pay for a mistake it didn't make? That would be unfair. A child born out of wedlock will be an outcast all his life. A piece of filth. And me... I could go back to my village, get married, start a family and forget. Slimani just left. He didn't forget the oil? No, he didn't forget anything. He seems like a good guy. He has feelings for you. Why not give him a chance? I don't like moustaches. Plus, he's too young for me. I'd be a laughing stock. He's not too young. A year or two younger? And he's kind, handsome, sweet. Do I look like I need a man? - It's not that. - Enough. - But... - I said enough. Why are you in a hurry? What do you mean? We still have a lot of work. You're not doing it right. I know my job. But you don't know your dough. What are you doing? Relax. Touch it. Gently. Feel it. Feel it as you knead it. Really feel it. I'm adding some coconut. This one's pretty. Make another one. Hello. Here you are, sir. - Thank you. - Please... Half a kilo of gazelle horns. And feqqas. Samia, hand me Mina's order. - This one? - Yes. - Here. - Thanks. Happy feast. Yes, sir? Half a kilo, please. I hope they're fresh, not frozen. Yes, from last night. Thanks. God bless. Have a look, ladies! Perfumes for cheap! Thanks, enjoy. Thank you. Happy feast. Perfume for the pretty ladies! Just a few coins to smell sweet. A little perfume, sister? The feast is soon. Try it. I also have scarves. It's quality merchandise. Here, it's too strong. - A scarf? - No thanks. Give me a biscuit then. - Let us work. - Just a biscuit. God bless you. - How much did you say? - Two kilos of feqqas. Two kilos. Thank you. Happy feast. Seventy dirhams. Thank you. Goodbye. Pastries for the feast! Hurry, they're almost gone! Here, eat. Samia? Want some water? No, thanks. I can get you some, if you want. You're still awake? Sleep, you've got school tomorrow. Good night! Good night! Good night! Good night. Hurry up, Warda. You're late. - May God keep you and protect you. - Amen. May He remove the thorns from your path. Amen. May God bless your parents on this day. May God help you. I need sugar. Please. Okay. Let go of it, it's mine... How do you know? I said it's mine! It's mine! It has a dark spot on its eye. Do you think I'm stupid? Yours is skinny as a cat! Let go of my sheep! This street is full of thieves! Let go of it, I said! You're crazy! You're the crazy one! Stupid animal! Samia? Samia, what's wrong? Come. Help me, Slimani. Breathe, breathe... Push, help me. Push! Harder! Push! What will you name your son? Well? There must be a name you like. I won't give him a name. Look at him. He's got your eyes. There, there... He's hungry. He's hungry. You must nurse him. Samia, he must drink your milk. It's important for him. Do you hear me? It's no use. In the morning, I'll drop him off for adoption. The agencies are closed. Because of the holiday. No, it's not possible. Tomorrow morning is my limit. You have no choice. I don't care. I won't keep him until Monday. I heard about a woman. She takes newborns, finds them parents. That's out of the question. Do you want this child to be sold like merchandise? You're under my roof. You will wait. We'll drop him off together Monday morning. What are you doing? I'm making rziza. There might be customers tomorrow. I don't need any, thank you. Go get some rest. Come on, get up. Get up! Get up. Keep him in your room. Please. Take him. Now, go sleep. Don't worry, everything will get back into place. My mother closed my bones when Warda was born. We must close that which opened to give life. It's all my fault. He didn't do anything. I don't want him to suffer. You can still change your mind. With me, he's doomed. And without me, I'll never know. His name is Adam. Adam... It's beautiful, Adam. I'll be ready in the morning. Warda. See you tomorrow, Samia. Come drink mama's milk. Drink, my baby, drink... Mama, my mama Let me fly away No, no, my child You're still small Stay in the nest When you grow up You may fly You may fly With the birds To my mother
