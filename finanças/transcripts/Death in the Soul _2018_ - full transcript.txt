We'll go away, you and I. Where? Round the world by boat. Like we've always said. What about school? Mum won't like that. We won't tell her. We'll sneak out at night. Tomorrow night? Yes. Now go to sleep. I love you lots, you know. My name's Marc Lagnier. I live at 17, Allée des Acacias, Valmont. I've just killed my son. This way. Evening. Lieutenant Taillac. My colleague, Stéphanie Morel. Hello. I've made coffee. Will you have some? I'll leave you with Stéphanie. Thanks. We'll go to the station to take your statement. Lieutenant Taillac. Will you explain what happened? No, no. No, Dana. The hearing is 12th, not 13th. That's how it is, we don't choose. Don't worry, we'll talk before. I must go now. Jeanne, the Couteret file. Message to my client: "I don't have your documents, "prescription's in 5 days. "If you see a dentist you take your teeth. "I'm not responsible." He's getting on my nerves. A SOUL IN TORMENT Lagnier won't see you. He says he'll see you at the trial. Hang on, hang on. Just a second. Give him this. Thank you. Look, I don't want to know what happened. It's not my problem. Saying nothing is not a good idea. This is a small town. We know one another. Everyone's nosy. The more you hide, the more they want to know. Even your family lawyer, Decaux. That's why he dropped you. I don't want the truth. I'm just here to get you out. But to do that, I need a story to tell. One that makes sense. I'm waiting. Look, you have to have a lawyer in court. Me or another. The other will do what you want, you'll see him at the trial. Maybe. But things can come out at the trial. In court the president is powerful, he can ask for a new enquiry. If you don't want anyone to know why you killed your son, I'm your best chance. Think about it. Goodbye. Police. - How are you, idiot? - Fine, fuckwit. Why did you accept this case? I didn't accept it, I did everything to get it. Why work your ass off when there's a confession? Especially with Judge Faidherbe. One year from retirement, he doesn't care. He didn't ask for further information. How will you build a defence, if Lagnier won't talk? On a made-up story? No, no. I said that so he wouldn't refuse me. What then? I'll do my job. I'll try to understand. When I do, he'll talk. Don't touch that! Think you can outdo us? Yes, because I'm not a cop. People talk to me more easily. When they see you, they clam up. Get smart, get smart... Tristan, honestly, I'm not joking. If you go too far, no one will help you. Think carefully. Don't worry. I know what I'm doing. Shit. - Hello. - Journalist? No, I'm a lawyer. Tristan Delmas. I'm defending your husband. - Got a cigarette? - Sure. Wait. I forgot how awful it is. Yes. I don't see how I can help you. I told the police everything. I was asleep. Never mind that. I'm interested in earlier, the days and weeks before. Were there, I don't know, any warning signs? - Fights? Threats? - No. Fathers don't kill sons like that. I'm sure you know why he did it. - No. - "No"? Marc adored his son. And vice versa. "His son"? He was your son too, incidentally. I'm sorry, I must go. I'm expected. - What are you doing here? - I must talk to you. Can't you go away till things settle down? "Till things settle down". I've been hearing that phrase for 10 days. My cleaner said it too, in a text: "Till things settle down." But nothing settles down in this town. This is my house. Sorry. Thanks. I don't understand. Why did you follow me here? You thought you'd get answers to your questions? Maybe, yes. I've done whatever I can. When he was small, it was OK. Like with Pauline. Pauline's my daughter. With her there were never any problems. But him... In high school, he stopped working. I wanted him to be a boarder after Christmas. I thought it would do him good to be more supervised. But he wasn't keen. - Who? Your son? - No, Marc. He said he could look after him on his own. I should have insisted. If he'd been a boarder... Thanks for arranging for the body to be released. That was kind. If you want to see his room, it's sealed off. OK. Well, I... I'll come back later. See you. OK. You weren't drunk, stoned... Nothing. Nothing to explain a fit of madness. So what shall we say? Shall we say you killed him because... he was idling about, skipping school, smoking weed? No. You didn't care about all that. Your wife didn't like him much, no? She refers to him as "Alex" or "your son", as if he wasn't hers. She has nothing to do with it. She was asleep. "She was asleep." If I used rubbish psychology I'd say... you had one kid each, no? You're right. That's rubbish psychology. I don't think so. - Ms Vasseur. - Tristan! You've not changed since high school. I was your pupil then. You were close to your pupils. I thought that... you could tell me about Alex and his father. I know Marc Lagnier well. At least, I thought I did. Meaning? He's a good man, very committed. He was more present for his son than for his daughter. Really? He and Alex had a fusional relationship. It's absurd. Did Alex have a girlfriend? I'm a teacher, Tristan. Not an agony aunt. Girls liked him, I know that. After his death, did they provide counselling? Yes, of course. I can give you the list of those who saw the psychologist. - It'll take time. - Fine. That would be great. I think you're very brave to defend Lagnier. I hope you won't pay for it. So do I. It's the bastard defending Alex's dad. Yes, I'm the bastard. Pleased to meet you. Mr Delmas. Yes... I'm the bastard. - You're the lawyer? - Yes. - Hello. Come with me. - Hello. It's impossible. Marc can't have killed Alex. But he's confessed. - Cops make people say anything. - But lawyers don't. Maybe. I don't think so. Here's the proof: I asked to visit Marc. He refused. He knew he couldn't lie to me. His son meant the world to him. He took good care of him. Not Valérie? She had complications after the birth. - What kind of complications? - I don't know. But she was in hospital for months. What was Marc like as a boss? He stayed down-to-earth. He saw his wife's friends, but they weren't real friends. With me, no need to pretend. Were you surprised when he married the boss's daughter? With Marc, no. He was madly in love. - And her? - Her? She didn't look at him. One day he helped her with a puncture. A month later they married. Old Dantin wanted better for his daughter, but she was pregnant. - So he accepted it. - Hang on. - She was pregnant, that fast? - Apparently. Pauline isn't Marc's daughter? You want me to help Marc? He never talked about Pauline. But though I was no good at maths, I could count. Judge! I'm Mr Delmas, Marc Lagnier's lawyer. I have a hearing. Have you compared Marc's DNA and his son's? What do you mean? A paternity test. If Alex wasn't Marc's son, that would change things, no? I don't see why. Look... He adored the kid. Then, suddenly, he finds out he's not his, after 17 years. That could make him lose it. - Towards the mother, maybe. - Yes. OK. We'll do it. But be careful how you go. Of course. He won't explain. He just says he's taking responsibility, and wants to be tried as soon as possible. That's not enough for me. We're still live on EBFM, 94.8. I'm with Tristan Delmas, lawyer of Marc Lagnier... Tristan is Dad's lawyer? And the presumption of innocence? - You know him? - A bit, yes. He was at school with me. Were you there? I wasn't. 94.8, here are the headlines. Kathy Balard: the police have a lead relating to the death of this young seasonal worker. A junkie from a squat in Villers-l'Étang... - How do the bastards know? - They have money. I hope the suspect's not listening in. - OK? - Hello. - Where is it? - Over here. - Oh, it's raining. - Why all these people? Come on, Mum. It'll be OK. Hello, Pauline. - Have a seat. - No. Your call surprised me. I thought you'd be with your family. Why defend my father? - It's my job. - Yes. I know you wanted to take the case. Why? I don't understand. To get famous at our expense? You're the only one who sees the case as an opportunity. I know you, You're an opportunist, after your own interests. But this is about my father. He deserves someone who'll fight for him. Thanks for the encouragement. Shit! Pauline! I'm defending him for a challenge. It's a tricky case. - And a mediatised one. - Yes. So? That means I mustn't go wrong. - Has he told you what happened? - No, he's said nothing. His childhood friend is sure he didn't do it. - There's my mother. She saw it. - No. Your mother woke up when she heard the shot. Not the same. What does that change? We don't know if it's true, or your father's covering her. No one else was there. - What are you suggesting? - Nothing. My work's to make hypotheses. I'm not defending your mother. So you'll accuse my mother to bail out my father? You can't. He's her son too. Why didn't she file a civil case? What? Pauline! You loved him. What happened? You must explain to me, Dad. I won't tell anyone, but I need to know. To understand. I'm sorry. You're sorry? You say you take responsibility. You aren't. Or you'd explain. You're a coward. What are you hiding? And what is Mum hiding? No one knows what happened but you two. She's not hiding anything. She blames herself for not seeing it coming. Seeing what coming? Last time I was home, at Christmas, it was all fine. Talk to me! What happened in a year, to make you... Do you realise the evil you've done? And are still doing, by not talking? If you loved us... Because I love you. I'm sorry. But you're sick. And Tristan's doing his best to get you cleared. I hope he'll give up and you'll get the maximum. Yes, Pauline. It's me. You're angry. I understand. I behaved like a bastard. Please call me, I really need to talk to you. Thanks. What does he want? Yes, Marc? Can't it wait till this afternoon? Did you put these ridiculous ideas in my daughter's head? So that's it. You want to upset her even more? She's upset because her father killed her brother. I'm doing my job. I had no choice. My client won't talk. I don't want to be a sideshow. If you want to fire me, fire me. There are plenty more clients. Have you finished? Then listen, for it's the last time I'll say this. I'm the only one responsible. Leave my wife and daughter alone. Got it? Got it? You didn't love your son. - I'd have given my life for him. - Really? But he didn't have an incurable disease. Did he? So what then? Was he gay? So he was gay. Did he want a sex change? To convert to Islam? Hell, give me something. No one kills a son he loves! It's Tristan. The Dubois case is on the news tomorrow, but the electronic version's not till next week. This was delivered. From the court. Thanks. - How's your son? - Bastard. Have a nice day, you too. Paternity test Lagnier Table of comparison Murder of Alex Lagnier Paternity test So, what's this... Mother. I heard you on the radio. I was with Simone. I was ashamed. Why are you defending him? Because I'm an idiot. - Your father doesn't understand. - He doesn't need to. Enough. Disgusting. I'm coming. Just a minute. - You're not patient. - And you're not fast. Sorry, it's a mess, but I'm working here right now, until I get an office. You receive clients in your room? - Sometimes. - Really? No, I'm joking. Thanks. - Coffee? - Yes. It's my grandfather's warehouses. - What? - On TV. - What are they doing? - It's for the high-speed train. - Surely not. - It is. After 2 years, work on the high-speed train is starting. If my father sees that, he'll go mad. - They're just old warehouses. - No, they're not. They matter to him. They're symbolic. He argued when Mom wanted to sell them. Sorry, but what are they a symbol of? A symbol... To remind us where we come from. I see. I'm sorry. It's not your fault. It is. The railway line was in the fields before. It was I who defended... the farmers' association. And I won. You never lose. Are you proud? - No. I feel sorry. - You are proud of yourself. Have a look at this. The list of pupils who saw the shrink. Do you know any of them? After school I went to Paris to do architecture. Alex was, let's see... Nine. I didn't know his friends. And this? Any idea? It's exactly him. Except he looks... He looks desperate. That's why he said that. - Who? - My father. He said Mum didn't see it coming, that she blamed herself. - About Alex? - Yes. Well, I'm not sure, it wasn't clear. - Was your family always like that? - What? It seems you never talk. - We do talk. - No. Your mother won't say a word. Don't start again. In your schooldays, she was on committees. - Too involved, yes. - But not with Alex. She wanted to put him in boarding school. - You didn't know? - No. That doesn't mean she didn't love him. Boys are different. When he was born, she wasn't there. My grandmother was ill. Wasn't your mother in hospital? No. It was my grandma. - I don't think so. - Who told you that? - Never mind. - Tell me. Never mind, I said. - More coffee? - No. I want to ask you a favour. Can I see the items taken from Lagnier's? Just Alex's room. His things, his computer, photos... The prosecutor has some. The rest's gone back. You'll find zilch. Is his room still sealed off? Until an officer goes to open it. By the way, I heard you on the radio. Yes. You're good, you bastard. But raising doubts won't be enough to save Lagnier. You need more. I'm working on it, cop. Excuse me a moment. Yes. You're not disturbing me. Murderers Monsters Shame I have a painter coming to remove all this. Come in. Why did they use the plural, on the gate? If you want to get Alex's things, it's upstairs. OK. Anonymous phone calls, graffiti... What next? Violence? Mum, you can't stay here. Pack a bag and come with me. - I prefer to stay at home. - Please. It'll be OK, darling. I'm sorry, you came for nothing. That's not why I came. It was to talk about Alex. Why did you lie when he was born? You said you were with Grandma. You were in hospital. - It's not the right time to talk. - Why not? Because Tristan's here? I saw his car. He might be interested too. Right, Tristan? Stop that! Why do you keep everything hidden in this family? - Isn't this enough? - It's not the time. It's never the time! Never mind. Are you all right? Sorry. It's fine. Leave it, I'll deal with it. It's OK. Look, here's a list of pupils. I think you know some of them? Just one. Fred Collot. He was Alex's best friend at school. He often visited him, in Villers-l'Étang. Could it be Fred who drew this? I don't know. That monster. Do you think... Is it supposed to represent someone? You heard Pauline and me. You can draw your conclusions. A father who cares for his child is admired. An inadequate mother is pointed out. Why "inadequate"? After Alex was born, I had post-natal depression. I had suicidal urges, psychotic episodes. I was dangerous to him and myself. I was sectioned, I completely recovered, everything went back to normal. - "Back to normal". - Back to normal. - Hi. - Hi. - You OK? - Fine, and you? Fine, thanks. It's OK. - A cigarette? - No, I don't smoke. You're right. OK. Did he often come to your house? Yes. but he hadn't been for a month when... Well, you know. - Did you quarrel? - No. But he didn't care about studies. He'd have given up, but... His father kept a close eye on him. When Alex came to my place, he always called to check if he was there. Annoying. So Alex had to make up a story if he wanted to go out. Make up a story? What do you mean by that? Well, the day he was killed, I saw his father drive past our house. Alex wasn't supposed to come, but who knows? Maybe he came past by chance. I don't know. Yes, possibly... If Alex had lied, why would that be? A girlfriend? No, no. Or he'd have been happier. - You think he wasn't happy? - I don't know. So why say that? - Did you draw this? - No, Alex did. He had talent. He often drew things like that. I didn't find any in his room. Because he always tore them up afterwards. But I managed to save this one. It was you who stuck it on the fence. What does the monster represent? Alex said it was death. Hello? Yes, it's Pauline. Would you like to come for dinner tonight? Er, no. That's a nuisance. Of course I'd like to. - Here. - Thanks. I should have guessed she'd lie to save face. As if depression was a defect. And she wasn't happy when expecting Alex. As if she didn't want another child. As if she didn't want another child, or she didn't want one with Marc? You know he's not my biological father? - Do you know your real father? - No. My mother would kill me rather than tell me. I don't care. Marc's my father. Maybe you're right. She didn't love Alex the same because he was his. Hey, you didn't have a house like this when we were in school. - No. It's not bad at all. I'm a criminal lawyer. If you did a supermarket holdup, you can tell me. My grandfather left it to me. Alex and I redid the whole thing. - Really? - Yes. I gave him a key. so he could chill out here, while I was in India. He wanted to paint it all black. And he didn't finish. Hell, I've drunk too much. I'll leave you in peace. - Talk tomorrow? - Yes. Yes. I'm sorry, I did my best. What's wrong? Pauline, what's wrong? What's wrong? I feel very bad, Pauline. It's been weeks. I don't know what to do. It's destroying me from inside. It has to stop. I'm constantly scared. I can't stand it. I can't live like this. I have to end it. If I'd been there, he'd still be alive. You can't say that. He says he wants to kill himself. He can't have. Why would your father confess? - He's no fool. He's facing life. - I don't know. - I'll show him. - No. You can't. They won't let you take that in. - But you can. - You're too involved. I'm defending your father. I'll come with you. Are you a lawyer? You can't get into the lawyers' visiting room. No way. My brother left me a message. I owe him that. I owe it to my father too. It's that or I won't give it to you. OK, I'll sort something. Pull! Come on, guys. Gently. I can't stand it. I can't live like this. I have to end it. Marc. - You knew he was suffering. - What would it change? It changes everything! He wanted to kill himself. You didn't manage to stop him. It's the truth. It was an accident. The truth is... If he wanted to die, it's because I wasn't a good father. No, that's not true. Even if it was, it doesn't make you a murderer. Does it? True. If you tried to stop him killing himself... - There's no "if" about it. - Pauline, please. If you tried to stop him but failed, why didn't you tell the police? - To protect my wife. Seriously? Is it better for her to think you killed your son? I don't ask you to understand. You can't go to jail for a murder you didn't commit. - Darling... - No. I can't lose you too. Don't give up. Look, I confessed to murdering Alex. No one will believe me now. I believe you. Tristan believes you. Tell him, you. You must be convincing. The story must be water-tight. I can't do it without you. You won't get another chance. The question is: are you ready to change your story? Yes. Don't get your hopes up, though. His version will be hard to sell without concrete proof. - You'll get him out of here. - I'll do my best. Thank you very much. But let me do things my way. - Don't tell anyone. - My mother? No. No one. I have to end it. This video must be accepted as evidence. You think you can turn things round with this? It all points to Lagnier. Ballistics, GSR test. The tests were done after he confessed. There was no need to look elsewhere. You're questioning police rigour and objectivity? Listen, I want the tests reviewed in the light of this video. My client may have tried to disarm his son. If so, why didn't he say so? For a thousand reasons. He blames himself for failing to stop him. To protect his family. So he'd prefer to be seen as a murderer... I know it's hard to imagine. But who knows how we'd react in such a situation? Very well. You'll get a review. I shouldn't say this, but... I hope it'll prove you right. Me too. - You're so pessimistic. - No. Realistic. Not the same thing. I look at the facts, that's all. The facts are this video. His suffering, his bad grades at school, his friend Fred's testimony, the drawing you showed me. Look at this photo. His last trip with my father. Look how sad he looks. - It's significant, isn't it? - It's significant. Hey! Misgivings? Remember, your father's my client. Does the penal code say it's forbidden? What shall we do now? You leave me now or you wait a week? We'll wait a week. Why did you dump me when we were at school? Because I liked you. Because I really liked you. That's why. Yes. That's why. It's stupid, but it's true. You know why? I had to do odd jobs to pay for my studies. I didn't go out at night, I worked. That's why I didn't see you. Why didn't you say? Because I'm stupid. Because I'm proud. Because I'm a coward. It's a pity. Yes, hello. Gaëtan Legrand? This is Mr Tristan Delmas. I have a few questions to ask you. OK. Thank you. Thanks, Olivier. Hello? I can't hear you. Hello? Shit... Yes. Ibrahim Sidi, please. What did you say her name was? Margaux Costes. Right. You knew Alex. Or you wouldn't have had counselling. I barely knew him. Death freaks you out. Did he have any girlfriends? Yes, sometimes. What does sometimes mean? A lot? Who was the last one? Charlotte, but it didn't last. Charlotte... Charlotte Nemours, is that right? Yes, Charlotte Nemours. Know why it didn't last? No idea. Ask her. OK. Margaux Costes. She's an idiot. Hello. - Charlotte Nemours? - Yes. Tristan Delmas, lawyer. I'm calling about Alex Lagnier. The shutters have been closed 3 days. What are you doing here? We thought you'd left. No. I just don't want to see you. If you could go and gossip elsewhere, I'd appreciate it. Excuse me. Sorry. - There. We won. - Thank you so much. Only you could get me out of this. You're the best. You're on probation now. Next time it'll be jail. - I won't get caught again. - No. You keep your nose clean. - Finished. - Keep your nose clean! OK! Oh... Yes. - Take care of yourself. - Yes. Hello. - Any news? - Not really. Come on. About the client or his daughter? - What do you mean? - Your car was outside her place. Stop it. I'm just happy because my client has been released. Tell me, I saw you the other day in Villers-l'Étang. The junkie led you to the body? He just said who he'd seen, that she shot him twice, was dating a guy from the marshes. - And you found the body. - Yes. The junkie will be brought to court. Why were you in Villers-l'Étang? She doesn't live there. I went to see her brother's friend. And? You know very well I can say nothing. - So you have nothing. - Right. The results of the new tests are inconclusive. - So we haven't lost. - But we haven't won. - You've lost hope. - No, it's not that. But we need concrete evidence. We have none. Like what? Like reliable witnesses, for instance, who could testify your brother was suffering: a shrink, someone he'd confided in. - I don't know. His godmother. He often visited his godmother, at one time. - Who's his godmother? - Hélène. Hélène Decaux. Hello. - I have an office, you know. - I know. I'd like to see your wife. Alex saw a lot of his godmother. As a kid, yes. Not recently. She might help me understand him. She stopped seeing him. He barely thanked her for the last present. Look, this tragedy has affected us all. Starting with her. I don't want you to reopen the wound. Why didn't you say Alex came in April? It's not his business. It's nothing to do with this. - I'm not so sure. - Hélène, you annoy me. - Take care. Ciao. - Bye. Charlotte! Charlotte Nemours? - Are you a cop? - A lawyer. I've nothing to say. - It's important. 5 minutes. - No. - It's important. Listen. - Why do you insist? It's my job, I'm a lawyer. - What happened with Alex? - Nothing. He was an idiot. - That suits you? - No, it doesn't. An idiot? His death upset you. You got counselling. What was the problem? It was his father. One day we were in his room. Kissing. We were doing no harm. His father came in and his look scared me. What do you mean? I don't know. He gave me a weird look. - Did he talk to you? - He told me to go. Alex shut up like a piece of shit. Did he explain about his father? He never spoke to me again. Can I go now? Yes. Here. Thank you. Be careful on the road. Murder of Katy Balard Suspect in custody claims his innocence Coffee with brandy at 8 am, now you're not in the headlines? Coffee, please, Joe. - No progress. - With Pauline or her father? If it's him, you'll be glad. The judge wants more investigation. - What do you mean? - Your damn video. You've managed to create reasonable doubt. The judge is scared of missing something. We must dig deeper. Be proud you've stirred the shit. - I did my job, that's all. - Really? Defending the theory of a suicide the father couldn't stop? That's nonsense. You're sure of yourself. Why would he commit suicide at his parents' when he could do it in peace at his sister's? - Did you think of that? - No, I'm stupid. You lost part of your brain when you took this case. And the rest when you fell for Pauline. You're too much. - I must get Alex's iPad. - I'll bring it tonight. - Here it is. - OK. Let's see what's inside it. - What's that? - A data recovery tool. See those two files? They've been overwritten. Those are overwritten files? - We can recover them, right? - No. Even the police can't. Maybe in CSI: Miami. - Hang on, we can... - No, sorry. - Nothing we can do? - No. Hey! You really need those files? What do you think? I'm asking you because I'm on probation. My lawyer told me to go straight, no messing... - So, have you finished? - OK. Yes, I have a programme that can recover them. The programme costs a fortune. - OK. - Don't exaggerate. Off we go. - Is that you? - Yes - See? - Not bad. Download complete. Don't mess up, OK? The monster. It suffocated the girl. With soil. Lots of soil. It was like a bad dream, for the next day there was nothing in the news. A nightmare. I didn't have it for weeks, and now it's back. The same one. The soil, the monster... It suffocates the girl. But this time, it's not the same girl. Or the same place. It happens in Givry. And I know the girl. Her name's Joséphine. I met her at the party. She exists. It drags her behind the cross, on the Black Road. It digs a hole. It puts her... News Missing Oh, fuck... OK? Why are you looking at that place? You know it? Yes. My father has a hunting cabin there. - What has it to do with the case? - Nothing. I have a client who lives there. - I'll get dressed. - OK. Black Road I'm totally crazy. When demolishing Dantin warehouses, workers found a body buried under the rubble. The identity of the victim, a woman, is unknown. - Kathy Balard, and now this one. - The same killer? Same type of girl, same method, soil in the mouth... Yes. It's the same bastard. Lucky you spotted this. The junkie? No, he couldn't have killed this one. She's been dead 8 months. He was in jail then. Do you know the girl? A 16-year-old who ran away in April. Joséphine. Keep that to yourself. For once we're ahead. Sorry, I'm in a hurry. I must go. I'll call you tonight. - Ciao, Joe! - Bye. What's up? Bad news? Yes. Yes, I have bad news. Joséphine's body was found in the rubble. The remains of the warehouses. Is that why you didn't want to sell the land? Tell me you have nothing to do with it. Or with Lola, found in Saint-Jeannet lake. Or with Kathy Balard, fished out of Villers pond. Tell me it's just a bad film! Fuck, it's not true. I can't have been that wrong. What did you think? I always told you I'd killed my son. He'd found out it was me, he was going to tell all. I couldn't let him do that. So you shot him dead in cold blood? Yes. At the time, it seemed the only solution. You could have given yourself up, shot yourself. Oh, no. I panicked. I panicked. And anyway, afterwards, there was no point in confessing. I'd have hurt Pauline and Valérie more. You can lie to your daughter. I didn't ask you for anything. I didn't want Pauline involved. You wanted to know, you wanted to understand. It must have excited you, when I was stupidly trying to prove it was suicide. It suited your plans, you ambitious lawyer. You gave the judge that video, not me. Am I wrong? When you watched that video, I felt sorry for you. It was a way to get you out of this mess. Yes. I still see it. And that's the line you'll take in your defence, as my lawyer. Your lawyer will screw you. Fuck off. I don't want to hear your arguments. I warned you. You wanted the case, you can keep it. Now the trial date has been set. You'll be there, like it or not. You have a month to prepare it. Remember your oath. The defence he gives you: you must plead that and only that. Or he can have you struck off. I won't oppose it. Do your job to the end, and do it well. Otherwise I'll deal with you. You can go now. It's a real mess. Joséphine, Lola, Kathy: we now know for sure they had the same killer. A killer at large, filling all parents with dread. We can see parents arriving at the scene. Tristan! I know you're there, I saw your car. Open up! All right! Shit, OK... - What's up? - Nothing. A coffee? No, I'm not here for coffee. Have you gone crazy? Why don't you answer my calls? - Tristan! - OK! I didn't sleep. I need to concentrate, and with you, I can't. Come off it. It's not that! I went to see my father and he wouldn't see me. Pauline, your father's my client. OK? What he tells me is confidential. You know that. Are you joking? Don't hide behind your oath. We sleep together, but I can't tell you. What? Fuck off. - Pauline! - Shut up! Asshole. You shut up too! My God, the broccoli's disgusting. The cabbages... Stupid bitch! - Is there a problem? - You have the problem. I know you, you bitch! Stupid bitch! It shows on your face! - Valérie! - Let me go! Who are you? Who do you think you are? You can't even see all the sluts your man sleeps with. And you there, Paul! Paul! How long will you believe your son's straight? Until he dies? He'll die of it! Calm down. That's right, put on airs. Let me go. I know what I'm saying! I didn't want to see it either. I didn't... And that pisses you off! It pisses you off! It blows up your shitty little world! Let me go! My God, Alex, what's wrong? What's happened? I saw something horrible. I was scared... Paul! Paul! What was so horrible? I don't know... What was it that scared you so much? Why were you out at night in a T-shirt, in this cold? I was... I was at the cabin with Dad. And... You haven't come from there on foot? No, we came home. I was dead beat. So I went to bed. And... I must have had a nightmare. I've had them before. I could have been sleepwalking. I woke up in the garden. I'd slammed the door and I had no keys. Your father wasn't there? He went to get his phone from the cabin. - I'll call your mother. - No use. She's in Paris for the weekend. I just came to ask for the spare keys. My husband took him home. He says it's not relevant, but it bothers me. Did you tell his parents? Yes. I told Valérie when she came back. She was annoyed. Alex wasn't supposed to go out. She wasn't pleased Marc had taken him to the cabin. I was worried about Alex's state. She clearly wasn't. I suggested he should see someone. I gave her the name of a good psychiatrist. - Did she take him? - I don't know. After that she became distant. Did you know she was sectioned after Alex was born? No. Oh, the poor thing. Maybe she didn't want to admit Alex had problems. I blame myself. I should have insisted... tried to talk to Alex again. It was like a bad dream. Next day there was nothing in the news. "26 February"... "26 February"... "26 February", shit. Lola was skiing in Saint-Jeannet. Last time she was seen was 25 February at 8.30 pm. But a few hours earlier, you'd broken your leg, and spent the night in hospital. You couldn't have kidnapped her. Still less killed her. The truth is, Marc... the one who killed Lola, Joséphine, Kathy, was your son. That's the truth. He kept looking at her in the restaurant. He even talked to her when fetching coffee. At the time, I took it at face value. I thought he fancied her. Then I heard she'd disappeared the night I was in hospital. Her body was found in the lake. Why did you think it was Alex? Because once... When he was six, I took him hunting. I'd shot a hare. Alex ran to get it. When I got there, the hare was only wounded. My little boy killed it by filling its mouth with soil. It was the look on his face. As if he felt nothing. He felt nothing. Lola... Did you ask him about her? No. I was in denial, I told myself I was wrong. But something was wrong before I took him there. Was he better afterwards? For a while, yes. In autumn it started again. A week before Christmas, Valérie went to Paris. I took Alex to the cabin. Givry, the festival... At some point I lost sight of him. I found him chatting up a girl. We went back to the cabin, to bed. I was half asleep when I heard him go out. When I found him, it was too late. He was just burying the poor girl. At the foot of the stone cross. Alex made a video where he talks of his nightmare. As if... As if it was someone else. In a way, it wasn't him. He was in a trance. I spoke to him, he didn't hear me. We went home. I told him I had to fetch my phone. I waited till he was in bed asleep. And you went back to the forest. You hid the body in the warehouses? Hoping it would never be found. I was terrified they'd trace it to my son. And terrified he might start again. He could have seen a shrink. I took him to one. We went to Switzerland and Belgium, using false names. Some talked of sociopathy, others of schizophrenia. They prescribed medicines. They didn't work, right? That's why you sent Charlotte away. I'd have done anything to keep her away. Yes. Until he found the next girl. I was on the phone, I heard him leave on his scooter. I tried to call him, but his phone was off. You followed him to Villers-l'Étang. - That's why Fred saw you. - I was too late. He'd just thrown the girl into the swamp. - I'm scared, Dad. - Calm down. I'm always scared, I can't stand it. Calm down. I had the nightmare again. The monster, the soil, suffocating... those poor girls. I can't stand it, Dad. It has to stop. I'm going crazy. I can't stand it any more. It has to stop. I'll find a solution. I promise. You scared me. Why are you here all alone? Are you ill? Was it Alex who left that mud in the corridor? It was me. I'll clean it up. How was your evening? The dinner was great. The film was rubbish. I can't see why the critics praised it. Rubbish. OK, I'm off to bed. I'm tired. Coming? In a minute. We'll go away, you and I. Where to? Round the world by boat. Like we always said we would. And school? Mum won't like that. We won't tell her. We'll sneak out at night. - Tomorrow night? - Yes. Now go to sleep. I love you lots, you know. "Lots." That's what you said when I was little. I love you lots. Lots. Your son was sick. Everything you did was out of love for him. That's what we'll say. When the jury hears you say what you just told me, I'm sure many of them will understand. No, I can't do that. Why not? Valérie's already in pieces, but what about Pauline? Her beloved little brother: a monster. Can you guarantee she can cope with that? Go on with her life? No, you can't. I won't take that risk. I've already done enough harm. So Alex killed himself, I couldn't stop him. Stick with that. OK. And if I screw up? If I can't convince the jury, you'll get 30 years. 30 years in jail, Marc. - Are you ready to take that risk? - Yes. And the victims' families? We forget about them? You never get over a child's death. No, Marc. I won't let you do this. You have no choice. - Sorry? - You have no choice. You swore an oath, Mr Delmas. I never said any of this stuff. Got it? Shit. No, don't call her. He's a friend. I'll be back. Shit, man... What came over you? - I'm an idiot. - I agree. Driving with 0.5 g alcohol in your blood, falling out with a guy who has right of way, pissing off your colleagues. I'm in deep shit. It's OK, no one's died. No, I really am in the shit. If this isn't about Pauline, it must be about her father. That's why you tried to call me last night. You know the truth, is that it? What did we miss? Eh? What did we miss? - Why did I give up my law studies? - Because it took 6 years? Because of this oath between client and lawyer. It's bullshit. I could never stand lawyers, anyway. You're my mate, but I hate you for this. Thanks, mate. You're right. Oaths are bullshit. What happened? Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Madam foreman of the jury, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, what I'm going to ask you today is difficult. What I'm going to ask you is to think about what it means to kill someone. What does "kill" mean to you? To take away life? To make someone disappear? To sacrifice someone? I'd like to tell you the etymology of the French word "tuer". "Tutare", in Latin: "to put out a light, "to snuff out." So killing is sometimes also a form of courage. Madam President, my client, Marc Lagnier, loves his family. Like you, Mr Foreman. Like you, ladies and gentlemen of the jury. The job of a father who loves his son is to help him build his personality. It's to protect him. And when the child grows, and starts making his own choices, he escapes from you. One day, he becomes an adolescent. He may become a stranger who no longer confides in you, who withdraws, takes drugs, skips school, hides in his room. Despite all this, you still love your child, because he's your flesh and blood, your family: he's part of you. What I ask you to do, ladies and gentlemen, is to put yourselves in the position of Marc Lagnier, when he discovered his son had a disease that eats into your soul. A disease that suffocates you. A disease that makes you think everything is black. A disease that stops you from living. What would you have done? What would you have done in his place? Marc Lagnier killed his son. No. I ask... He withdrew his confession. What are you saying? What I'm trying to show is how far a father's love can go. Silence, please. My client, Marc Lagnier, is a father who loved his son. Silence, ladies and gentlemen. My client, Marc Lagnier, whose name has been more than sullied in recent weeks, my client did everything he could, everything, to protect his son, but he failed. That's why he chose to lie. That's why he chose to accuse himself. And today, my client... is convinced he killed his son. He feels really responsible for this suicide, because he couldn't prevent it. That is the truth. So, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the love of a father for his son, is it to be condemned? I don't think so. Ms Lagnier, you must be relieved by the verdict. Yes. Excuse me. Tristan. Thank you very much. You were brilliant. I'll take my father home and join you later. OK? I love you. Well done. Your suicide story was great. But don't worry, I'll find out what happened. I hope you will. Subtitles: ECLAIR
