THE HOUSE OF THE ANGELS Third Time Lucky. - Hi, Mum. - Hi, darling. Do you want something? No. Can't you tell me about House of Angels again? - Why should I do that? - I just want to hear about it. You've heard it a thousand times before. I like hearing about it. There was once a place called House of Angels - - that your mum inherited from her mother's father - - where your grandma grew up. It burned down, and that's all there is to say. It's why we could buy this place. I know that. I mean tell me about your father, Axel Flogfält. - Where have you heard that name? - On Facebook. - Is Axel Flogfält on Facebook? - He's a bit old for that. It's his grandson, Mans. He's added me. He was looking for your mother... but then my name popped up. - We're both called Alice. - And? - And he's told me a few things. - Sorry, but what...? What's he said? - That the letter he's got... - What letter? The letter from your mother to Axel. It says that Axel is your father. But the rumour in the village is that you claim Ivar to be your father. I don't know who my father is. - So why have you said it's Ivar? - I don't know! - Then we can go back and find out! - Why? There's nothing for me there. Stop thinking about yourself! I want to know who I am! I want to know who my grandfather is. I know I don't come from here. My dad's not here. He's Zac, but I don't even know if I can believe that! You've lied to me big time... ...and I think you can do this for me. - Do what? - Go back. We are gathered here to pay our last respects to Rut Flogfält. There's one word that comes to my mind when I think of Rut. And that word is Faithful. Rut was a faithful woman... ...in the broadest and most beautiful sense of the word. She was faithful to her village. This was where she wanted to live, amongst the people she loved... ...and who loved her. In a landscape that was etched into her soul. Rut... ...we miss you so much. There's been a mistake. It's not Rut who should be lying here. I'm good for nothing... without you, Rut. - Hi. - Has she called? - I'm at the station. She's not here. - The station? Go to the airport! - Relax, it's OK. - Zac, you said you'd be at the gate! You can't leave her to travel alone to the station! She's 15. 15 is worse than 10. At least at 10 she'd have a note round her neck. Oh, God, where can she be? I'm so sorry. - And you are...? - Alice. Fanny's daughter. I'm really so sorry. But I have to go now. Who was she? Hi, Mum. I'm not in Berlin. I'm in Yxared. I know you'll be mad, but don't worry, I'm on my way home. Call me when you hear this. Bye. Don't I get a hug? Alice! Look, we've got to talk about this. Alice! - Are you listening to me? - Yes, Mum, I'm listening. Why don't you want to go back? Because... Why would it be so hard for you? - It's harder than you think. - No, it's not. So much time has passed. What do I say? "Hi, it's me!” - So? Your have a father there. - Not just one father... Maybe you've got things to sort out... Hi. We're going back. Yes, I'm certain we're going back. - Hi, Henning! Careful, it's heavy. - Welcome. It's been ages. - Henning. - Welcome. - Alice. - Hi. Henning. We've met. - Oh, yes, you've met. - Is that your car, Henning? - I can take it! - No, it's no problem. - And I've got a little surprise... - A surprise? - Is that Eva? - Yes, it's Eva. Hi, Eva! They're back. Why the church bells? - What are you doing? - Closing up. - But it's only 4. We shut at 5. - Not today. They're back. - Hello, Fanny. - Kristoffer. Welcome. - Hi, Alice. The White House. What a place! - Is there a fire? Why ring the bells? - I thought that... I'll talk to you later. Welcome. Oh, my God. - It reminds me of something. - Certainly does! - Come through. - Not bad for a vicarage! Indeed! Excuse the mess... - Where do the doors lead? - That one leads up, that one down. - And? - Heaven. Hell! My God. Wow, what a beautiful lake! Here's the dining room... Are these paintings relatives of the woman who lived here? - I don't know. - Kristoffer, can you take care of their bags? Take them up. Leave it to me. - I can give you a hand. - Thanks. - That was a good idea. - Mum! Can you swim in the lake? - I don't know. - Sure you can. It's water, isn't it? You and me, Henning. Inheriting houses. I'm not sure how I'll be able to look after it. It's so big. Run down. I didn't want House of Angels at first either. I inherited it, but now... I'm sad it doesn't exist any more. - Is that why you've not come back? - It's a bit more complicated than that. That's the last of them. - Kristoffer, is he...? - He lives upstairs. He's my... apprentice. He's a curate. I thought I'd take a trip down to the ruin tomorrow. Just to see what state it's in. If there's anything I can do. - It's not there any more. - Not there? Marten's bulldozed it. - Didn't you know? - No. They bought the land around it, but the land where the house stood is mine! - So it's Marten who calls the shots? - Yes. You could say that. What does Axel say about it? Axel doesn't say very much. He's totally dumb. He hasn't spoken a word since Rut's funeral. - What they hell do they want here? - No idea. Well find out. They're up to something. - Like what? - How the hell should I know? 15 years, and they show up, just like that. They're not exactly on holiday. - Are you... you and Henning...? - No, no. I'm his apprentice. I'm his disciple, you could say. - How long have you been living here? - Let me see... Five months. How come Henning has such a fantastic house? A gift from God. - There are no rats here, are there? - Sure. All old houses have them. - What sort of bird is this? - A wood grouse, I believe. - Are the flowers your work? - Yes, the daubings are mine. - Oh, they're good. Only flowers? - I like flowers. Flowers are easy. People are difficult. You're right there. - Thanks for letting us stay here. - It's a pleasure. I have lots of room. I think I'm going to need some of your support in the coming weeks. You're doing the right thing. Sometimes you just have to go back in life to move forward. - He wants my job. - Who? - Him. Him... - Kristoffer? I know he wants it. I'm certain of it. - Keep it to yourself though. - Of course. Shall we go up? - How many rooms are there here? - Up here, I don't know. Four, five... I thought I'd put Alice up here. Oh, the Princess's Chamber! And here's your and Zac's room. These dresses hanging in here. Were they hers? - Whose? - The woman who lived here. - Elsa's? - What was her full name? Elsa Grubbe. Could we separate the beds and put the tables between them? Separate them? It's not that Zac and I can't share a bed, it's just that... ...it'd be nice to... No, I understand. Hi. We're just rearranging the furniture to give us more space. I thought you might stay in here. - Hello. Is she here? - Fanny! You have a visitor! - Marten! - Hi. Hi. - Back again? - Back again. I was just passing... - Fifteen years ago, right? - Sixteen. Shit. Sixteen. - You're still looking good. - You too. A little fatter, a lot wiser. That makes two of us. - I heard you still use your tractor... - That's right. ...as a bulldozer. I guess we'll talk more about that later. Please accept my condolences over the death of Rut. - I heard that Axel isn't talking. - No. I'm running things now... Marten, hi! - Alice is my daughter. - I know. We've met. - And this is my little bugger, Mans. - Hi, Mans. I've heard so much about you. If you want anything, just give me a call. You know where I am. - So what did she look like? - What did she look like? What do you think. As hot as hell! Not a day older. You serious”? Oh, Jesus Christ... What about him? We played an accordion in one of our numbers once, actually. - Would you like to hear it? - Please! - What's Mum up to? - Performing. Maybe she's returned to the stage! That was the only note I could play! When I showed my bum they cheered. Is everything OK with you? Are you sure? - You can sleep in our room if you want. - No thanks, it'll be too cramped. - But I love you. - I love you too. - Sleep tight. - Do you think she'll cope? Yes, Mum will cope. What does she look like these days? What does she look like? Well, she... It's been a long time... She looks like most... I don't know. I didn't think about it. I was just wondering... Good night. - Can you sleep? - Yes. Can you? I can sleep here beside you if you like. - If you're afraid, that is. - I think it's a bit too small. And I'm not afraid. - There are no rats here. - How do you know that? - I see no poo. - Is there poo in our room then? Yes, loads. Zac... "Wake up, Zac. A rat!" Will you be able to cope, Mum? I think that... ...if I can cope... ...with sleeping beside Zac... ...and a load of rats and ghosts flitting around overhead... ...I'll be able to cope with finding my father too. Fanny... Are you sure you'll cope? Oh, you do go on. Why wouldn't I be able to cope with this? - Alice is worried. - But I'm here, aren't I? - After 15 years... - 16, actually. Good night. - What? - I heard something. - Did you hear it? - Go to sleep and turn off the light. Is it OK if we leave it on? Zac... Hearing rats is one thing. Seeing a rat is worse, believe me. Turn the light off. Go to sleep. - Turn the light off. - No, I want to keep it on. Standing here wondering if you're going to venture out? - I suppose I have to. - How will you get around? I've not given it any thought. We'll walk, I guess. Take my car. I've got two. Take the old one. - Is it safe to drive? - Oh, yes! It's never given me trouble. My name's Fanny. Zander. That's my daughter, Alice... and Zac. - I know. - I'm looking for Ivar. He's having his breakfast. - Is he having his breakfast at home? - As he usually does, yes. Could you please tell him that Fanny's looking for him? - Shall I go in? - Yes! - No, Mum. Why are you so...? Ivar! Ivar. Hi! Hi... It's been a long time. Welcome. Forgive me. It's all right. I'm glad you came. Just you being here... I was going to come earlier but so much stuff got in the way... ...and the time just flies and before you know it... Early, late. You're always welcome. - How are you? - Alright. How are you? You know, I've got my daughter outside. Alice. - Really? - I've sent... You got the photos? Oh, yes. I got them. She's pretty. - Would you like to meet her? - Of course. First, though, I'd like to ask who the woman was who opened the door. She's my home help. - She didn't want me to come in... - Is that so...? She wants to do everything herself. Come on, let's go and say hello to Per-Ove. Hi. Hi... - Alice, Fanny's daughter. - Eva. - So it's not a shop any more? - No. Isn't there anywhere to go shopping now? Of course we have a shop. There's a grocer's up the road by the church. So who runs it? Per-Ove... - Alone? - No... With his wife. - So how long are you staying? - For the summer. - The whole summer? - If it was up to me, yes! There are things we need to sort out, so we don't really know. We have no fixed plans. We'll stay as long as it takes. - You're Mans's mother, aren't you? - Sorry, but how come you know Mans? He added me on Facebook a while ago. We've just chatted a little. I'd really like to meet him. No, I'm sorry. I have to... - What's happened? - She's forced her way in! - Fanny? - Yes, into Ivar's house. Why have you left him alone with her? - He drove me away. - He drove you away? Well, not literally, but he gave me a strange look. Surely... Shh! ...we've got Ivar waiting in the car. Well, I see the shop's closed down. - It's a weavery. - I can see that. - They're lovely! Who runs this? - Eva. She's in there. Is it Eva's? Hi, Eva! What an ocean of looms! Great to see you! I waved yesterday when we passed you in the car, but I guess you didn't see. Let me say hello properly. I know you're called Mona and you help Ivar. The thing is that Ivar's in the car and he's coming home with us. - But he can't do that. - No, he can't. He's an old man. I don't mean home to Mallorca. We're staying with Henning. So he's coming back for lunch. - But... - He can't eat paella etc. So, sorry... - Paella? - Yes. He only likes his meat and veg, so... But that's what we're having. Chops with onion gravy. How I've missed that! OK if we bring him back at 3.30? See you. Bye. - Onion gravy? - With his sensitive stomach... - Remember the sprouts? - What sprouts? You remember the Brussels sprouts. My father nearly died. You know, there was the ambulance, hospital, doctor, consultant... - It had moved nine centimetres. - What had? His heart! - Hi. - Hi. What are you doing? Well... waiting for you. Have they been here? - Who? - Them. Look, we're not taking any more wine orders. We're no longer an agent, OK? OK. Hi... - Was it alright? - It was delicious thanks. Pudding? Do we have a pudding? - I've made a little strawberry tart. - I wouldn't say no... - Would you like some coffee, Ivar? - Thank you. Did you love my mum's mother? Oh, yes, very much. - So you were together? - Sure we were. So why did it end? Alice! Kristoffer needs help with the tart. Tell him about the letter, now! Kristoffer's made such a nice tart, with a jelly glazing on the top. Very professional. Alice... Were you talking about Alice? She has asked me to... ...tell you about a letter that my mother wrote to Axel. In... In it, she writes that Axel is my... Here comes the tart! We'll have the coffee in here. I'll serve up when you're done. In the letter she writes that... ...Axel is my father. I guess that could be the case. There was little interval between us. But so what? You are my daughter. Ivar... Have you told Fanny that you're her father? Or haven't you? Sure, sure I have... I was starting to suspect the worst... He said there'll be lots of youngsters here. - But still... - It'll be fun to learn to tap. Listen! - Can't you join me? - No, I have an errand to run. An errand. I'll come in with you. - Hi, Kristoffer! - Hi! Great you could make it! - There's only two today. - It's always only two. But not any old two! This is Lilly and Leia. Per-Ove and Annki's girls. And that's Fanny and Alice, who I've told you so much about. - What's your shoe size? - Why do you want to know? - For the tap-dancing. - I won't be joining you, but... - ...Alice wanted to try, didn't you. - I take a 39. I can cycle Alice home if you like. On my rack. - Great. Good luck. Bye. - Bye. Alice, I'll just find you some shoes. You girls can show her what we've done today. - Have you danced before? - It's dead easy. Five, six, seven, and... - Come home. She's coming. - Shit. - Eva? - Hi! - So this is where you live? - That's right. - And Ragnar? - That was a long time ago. He was a bit depressed. So he moved out. So Marten and I have bought it. - Lock, stock and barrel. - What? - Lock, stock and barrel... - Oh, right, yes. - And Axel's here too, I understand. - Yes. We're looking after him. He's also a bit poorly. - I would've liked to see him. - I'm sorry, that's not possible. - Why not? - He can't speak, you see. - No, but I can. - Don't I know it. But no, it's... Five minutes, please. OK. Thanks. Hi, Axel. Mona, you won't believe me. Fanny's here talking to Axel. What? That can't be! Damn! - What's going on? - Now she's forced her way in to Axel. First it was Ivar and now she's forced her way in to see Axel! Forced? Come on, she's gone to say sorry about Rut. Maybe... I don't see why you get so upset about these people. What have they done? They seem exciting to me. - They've not done anything. - That's exactly it. They've just waltzed around the world like a couple of performance artists. It feels strange to come to this house. I remember swimming in the lake down the hill. - Hi. - Hi. - Have you come to see me? - They said you were here. When Rut showed me the letter. Axel received this letter 30 years ago. And I opened it. So I've known about it for 30 years. I've never been able to show him, because I love Axel so much. I wasn't supposed to open it. It was for Axel. Did you know that Axel and my mother had a relationship? No... I didn't know. But Marten's almost the same age as me... Yes, you're brother and sister. I know you're my father. And I know I've said that... ...that Ivar is my father. I know that too. But I don't want to hurt Ivar, and I don't want to hurt... ...you. I don't want to hurt anyone. - What the hell's she doing there? - I don't know. - You don't know? You let her in! - I know, but she insisted. And you just let her in, without sending her away! - I did actually try... - How fucking hard can it be? - What the hell's she doing there? - She just wanted to talk to him. - Talk to him? He can't speak! - I know that. He's talking. - You can talk! - Of course I can talk! But you've been silent. - Here you are. - Thanks. Per-Ove, what are we doing in this dump? It's too small for us. For you, at least. - Hi. - Hi, Marten! He was feeling... OK! - Nice. - Right. - Did you want me for something? - It was Axel I wanted to meet. - Are you happy here in the house? - I like it, yes. Yes, we're happy. Axel spoke a lot... He said that you're a pilot. Pilot's a bit much. It's a hobby of mine. - Have you got an airplane? - Yes, a little one. - Like that? - A bit bigger. Feel free to join me some time. If you dare. Why wouldn't I dare? I've never seen such creeping. Given that you'd just had a go at me for letting her in. And your father, who I've been looking after for ages without a word of thanks- - just sits there chin-wagging with her. Can you explain that? Then you invite her flying. You've never asked me! You can't even clean the upstairs windows. You go flying? No, all I'm good for is making coffee and buns? Go in to him, and tell him to leave. Get him out! I have heard of a city above the clouds. Above beautiful mist-shrouded lands. I have heard of the light sun-drenched strands. And one day, O what a day, I'll be there. Shut up! Be happy. Don't put a damper on it. This is fantastic. We'll speak later. Give him my love. Bye. Axel has started to speak again. Has he? It was Fanny who got him to talk. She did it. - That old man's got spirit. - Fanny's the one with spirit, I'd say. Henning... I thought I heard something. I thought it was a ghost, but it was only you. What do you think of Kristoffer? I think he's... ...wonderful. Wonderful. Look at the lovely food he made. And he's sweet to Alice, and Zac. He's fooling everyone. Everyone loves him. He sings in the choir... ...he plays accordion, he teaches tap-dancing. Everyone falls for it. But he just wants to take over my job. He wants me out of here. I have sinned. Rut and I had an affair for over 10 years. I loved her. Truly. I wanted to share my life with her. Move away from here. Maybe to another country. And I know she wanted the same. But life isn't that simple. She couldn't leave Axel. How we managed to keep it secret in a village like this is beyond me. Seeing everyone's faces in church every Sunday. I thought I'd go mad. One day we were brave. We went down to the coast. A fantastic place. With red rocks and the horizon in the distance... And there, out there, was where the world started. There was where our life together would begin. And then came that... ...bloody, bloody disease. When Axel stood up in the church at Rut's funeral... ...was on the point of embracing him and falling to my knees to confess all. Confess my sin. Is it a sin to love? Sometimes. If it is a sin, then Axel should go down on his knees too. What do you mean? He's my dad, isn't he. - So how much do you want for them? - I figured 50 each... OK, so if I add a 45 mark-up, that makes 95. 95? That's great. Great. - Zac. - I know. Per-Ove! - Mona, hi! Ivar made it home OK? - Yes, he was fine. Fanny, there won't be any more spontaneous excursions, will there? It's wonderful to meet you in the flesh. You're a legendary... - Legendary? - A legend, I mean. Annki, I gather. What a wonderful shop. - Thanks. - Hi. - Zac. - Annki. - Hi. Alice. - Hello, Alice. This is Per-Ove... - It's been ages. - Ages. - Fifteen years. - Sixteen, actually. Hi, Per-Ove. You haven't changed. He's had his ears done since you last met. He had very prominent ears before. It was a while ago you had them done. Maybe seven years ago. It was expensive, but they did a good job. Alice went tap-dancing with your girls. - That's right. - They said, didn't they. - Are they here? - Yes. Lilly! Leia! Come girls, come and see! What a fantastic shop. It's like a trip back in time. Yes, It's nice. It's Annki's idea to have all this local produce. - What lovely... - Flowers. Do you think so? They're tulips. I'd wanted to do poppies or something- - but I felt they weren't me, somehow. - Is it felt? - No, matted wool. - They'd be perfect for Henning. - Let's buy them. - How much are they? - 95. You can have them for 85. Each. Mona if you're selling direct to Fanny you can take the price you told me. 50. So we'll take them and that'll be that done. We were off into town to do some food shopping, but you have... I think we have most of the essentials. - Is it self service, or...? - If you write a list, we'll deliver. - Great. Can one buy wine that way too? - I don't offer that service any more. Of course. Just write down what you want and we'll get it for you. - We'll have 6 red and 6 white. - That's 6 bottles of red and 6 white. Any special kind? I think Per-Ove will choose something nice. - Do you think so? - OK. We'll go home and write a list of what we need. Are they Swedish? - Absolutely, they're from the farm. - May I try one? - Here. - We'll take three litres. And bread. And, oh, what lovely eggs. - Where do the eggs come from? - Chickens. - They're Eva's. - So Eva's started laying eggs? They're Eva's chickens... I get it. Another locally produced product, from a neighbour's farm... We'll take these strawberries and a dozen eggs. She also runs a little spa business upstairs. - It's not a spa. - So what can I call it? - I do facials and pedicures... - She's really good. You could do with a pedicure. - Do you do massage too? - That's what she's best at. - Sure. That's fine. - Do you have time? Tomorrow? - She's fully booked. - I have a cancellation at 12. That'd be great. Hello! Anyone at home? - Hi! - Hello, hello... my girl! I was just taking a stroll. I can't stay in that house. Marten is useless. Just goes on and on about business. Can I come in? Of course... but we have a guest in the dining room... - I won't intrude. Another time. - You're not intruding. It's Ivar. - It might not be so appropriate... - Ivar? I think it's very appropriate! Thanks. For coming to the funeral. Don't mention it. - Can't you talk to them? - That's your job. I know it's my job but can't you help me? - It's your problem. - I know that. But can't you help me? - But what shall I say? - Anything. Please. Just make sure they don't fight. Get in there. Thanks. Come and sit down, Ivar. What shall I do? "What would Jesus do?" - So what would he do? - Yes, what would he do? I asked first. He'd pray for a miracle. That wasn't the same situation. That was a virgin birth. - But he had two dads too. - Two dads? Joseph and God. Look, I'll go and see if the coffee's ready. You'll have to sort them out yourself. They're sitting there in dead silence. Have you realised, Ivar... ...that it's our turn next. - To what? - Die. - Does it trouble you? - No. - They're both sitting in there. - That's great. - Great? - You can get it all sorted. - Can't you come in and help me. - You said you'd cope and you will. Just go in and be yourself. I'm going out to see a friend. - What friend? - Mans. Coffee and buns are on their way. Oh, dear Lord... ...how beautiful you are, my girl. Like a beautiful woodland siren. Woodland siren? Right, Ivar? I'm getting more and more like my mother. She is someone I was very fond of. I'll just go and see if we're ever going to get that coffee. On 22 August 1964... ...I'd arranged to meet Alice by the outlying farm. And we were together. It sounds lovely. But I don't like to get hung up on dates. Don't you? I do. I never forget. I like to think of the time before, when Alice and I were together. - So we can't know. - No. Shall we go to the hospital and take one of those DNA tests? Do you want to know, Ivar? Look, Ivar. We are two lonely old buggers now. I need Fanny just as much as you do. Can we not agree that this fantastic woman- - would benefit from having two old dads? Look, let's take a walk in the woods. It clears the mind. The buns needed decorating, that's why it took... Ivar? Axel? - Maybe they went to the toilet. - Not together! - I'm not sure that was so wise. - They're walking together, aren't they? Ivar... If we're agreed on shared paternity... ...then there's something we have to discuss. The inheritance. No, not yours, Fanny's! I'll be dividing my estate into three. For Vendela, Mårten and Fanny. And that means that I have to see her as my daughter. Is that OK? That's your business. - How have you sorted yours? - It's sorted. Good, good. Can't you play a new song? How long are you staying? I don't know. There's a lot to sort out. - Is my dad's father your mum's father? - What a lot of questions. Aren't you going to play a new song? - Where do your girls come from? - They come from Belize. - Belize? - Belize? We've been there. - Just briefly. An hour in the port. - We were on a luxury cruise. - It wasn't a luxury cruise. - It was! We performed every evening in every port. I had a long, red sequined dress. "Caribbean nights"! I've got bananas hanging on wires from my ears down to here... - And not just the ears! - I had bananas everywhere! From my tits and from other symbolic places...! - Fanny had bananas... - It was a long time ago. - How old were they when they came? - They were so little. One was only 6 months and the other was three, they thought. We were there for a month before we could bring them home. - You haven't been back? - No, actually not. I've often wanted to. I've said to Per-Ove how great it would be to go back- - and take the girls so they could see where they come from. - What are you doing tomorrow evening? - Nothing. - Can you help me with something? - Sure. What? - 8 o'clock. I'll tell you then. - OK. - Mum? What's my star sign? - Pisces. - Do you know what you are, girls? - Virgos. - When's your birthday, Alice? - 18 March. - So you're also a Pisces. - Yes. - Do you remember us at that age? - What the...? They're the same age. I remember you. That worries me. Marten, what was it you said about Fanny that midsummer? What do you mean? Blah blah something... ketchup. You should have seen her neckline. Down to here... And that look in her eye. Shit, Jesus. The girl's as ripe as ketchup. Tomorrow I'm inviting her to the dance. - You? - Yes. You don't have the guts. Drop it. Drop it! If you say a word to that mouthy bloody wife of yours... Capisce? - When did you say Mans's birthday was? - 13 March. See? That's something you and Fanny have in common. - What? - You were pregnant at the same time. Oh, yes. Have you prepared the morning service for Sunday? - No, I... - No? No. No, OK, I see... Shoes off now, girls. Come on, Lilly... Hurry! So here's Marten with all his women... Yup, the cock of the roost. I've been thinking about your offer. I'd like to accept it. Offer? What offer? I'd like to see my old house from the air. I mean, I know it's burnt down... ...and been bulldozed, right? Then I'd like to see the plot it was on from the air. Why? To see how much land really belonged to me- - and how much I actually sold to your dad. OK, I can help you with that. Do you dare? What were you and Marten talking about? When? - What was it you said? - Nothing special. - You were being so secretive. - Were we? Marten told you not to tell anyone. What was it? - Have you bought crisp bread? - Yes... - Tomatoes? Strawberry juice? - Yes. - Don't you want to tell me? - About what? - What you talked about. - It was nothing. - Are you keeping secrets from me? - Of course not. So tell me. It's weird that you... We said we'd tell each other everything. - Were you talking about me? - No. - The girls? - No. So what was it? Why is it so hard to tell me? OK, if it really is so hard to tell me you don't have to tell me... I heard the kids talking about birthdays and star signs. Mans and Alice were born so close together. Both are Pisces. Go back nine months, you get to the midsummer weekend. That weekend, Marten promised that he'd tumble Fanny. You do the maths. Marten is Alice's father. Hang on a second... But Marten was together with Eva then. - Why...? - Yes. So what was he doing with Fanny? You'll have to ask him that. How should I know. That's what he said. - Have you been unfaithful? - Of course not. Why do you ask that? - Leggy Lena. In the strawberry field. - No. - I saw you cosying up down there. - You're being ridiculous. - I never saw you pick so many berries. - It's all in your mind! All in my mind? I borrowed the girls' binoculars and saw how you crept up to her. I saw it. Listen to me now. I have never been unfaithful to you. I swear. I've never heard such a thing. Marten! What a pig! We must not let this get out. - Of course. No one knows but us. - But you've told me. Of course. You're my wife. And besides, you nagged me into it... I have something to tell you. It's just between you and me, so we don't want to be spreading it around. But I wanted to tell you because I didn't want anyone else to know. Marten is the father of both Mans... and Alice. - Kristoffer! Have you heard! - I want to tell him...! Whoa! One at a time. What is it? - They're brother and sister! - Who are? Mans and Alice! It's true! - Who's been saying that? - Per-Ove! Per-Ove told Mum. We heard about midsummer and Fanny and Marten being together- - and that Marten is the father of... Is the father of...? Tell me. - Do you really believe that? - I don't know. It's what Per-Ove said. What does he know? Mum and Marten would never do that. - They're siblings. - What? Henning? I was down at the church hall... ...and the girls told me that they'd heard Per-Ove tell Annki- - That Marten is Alice's father. Alice was there and she got really upset and... - And what do you want me to do? - Maybe you could talk to Fanny. To spread this information around even more. Our community is full of people poking their noses into other people's lives. All this backbiting. We just have to put up with it. I have, believe you me. But for my own pastor's apprentice to engage in such slander and gossip- - makes me terribly sad. But grateful too. Grateful for having yet more proof of the depravities of human nature. Thank you. Thank you for that reminder. Did he chase any more women at mid- summer? For that's when it happened. That's when he had Fanny. He'd apparently been planning it. She's not said anything, and knowing her I can see why. But it's Marten... And the neighbours, they have a daughter- - who I thought about at once when Per-Ove told me. What if she too... - Thanks for the ride. I saw nothing. - You saw all there was to see. - Forests, fields... - Upside-down, yes. - My land. - Your land? Look, what the hell are you doing here? You sold to my father 15 years ago. The land belongs to my family now. - The family to which I also belong. - You belong? I'm your sister, Marten. Good night. There you are! What's this bloody rumour you're going round spreading? - Am I spreading rumours? - You're claiming to be Alice's father! Slow down. One thing at a time. - You come claiming to be my sister. - Which I am. But you're not the father of my child! How gross is that? We're siblings! All I know is that we danced one midsummer 15, 16 years... You remember, right Zac? We danced. And you flirted with him too. - You can't get pregnant from dancing. - No you can't! Marten, a man must have sex with a woman for her to get pregnant. And you'd know all about that, would you? I don't care who is whose father. What you and I must do now- - is to tell our children that this isn't true, that they're just cousins. Dad! - Hey, I want a word with you! - Not now! We need... Marten! Stop that. Stop that! - What is it? - Alice Zander. That name mean anything to you? You fucking liar. Heard the rumour going round? That I had sex with my own sister! And it's your bloody fault! - Did you? - No, but we were so bloody close. - No, it could never have happened. - Is that so? Because Fanny knew you were her brother... - So Fanny knew... - She's known all along. And your mother. Rut knew too. Can you forgive me? - You've heard. - Yes. What a joke. Marten! - Where's Mans? - I don't know. Out somewhere. Marten... I feel so... disgraced in front of the whole village! - Don't you have anything to say? - Gossip is a bunch of shit. You should know that. Your bloody brother... - What's this got to do with Per-Ove? - I've done many stupid things... And I'm sorry... But I'm not going to get blamed for something I didn't do. - So you didn't...? - No. - You're not...? - No. Fanny Zander is my sister. - Per-Ove! - Over here. You bastard! What the hell's got into you? What the fuck are you doing? Heavenly Father... Grant me the serenity of mind to accept that which cannot be changed. The courage to change that which can be changed... ...and the wisdom to know the difference. Amen. - What the hell was all that about? - What was it I said? Not a word to your wife, I said. Marten, you're the one who told me. You're the one who did it. What I said and didn't say fifteen years ago... Christ, I was drunk! - What does that matter? - To think I'd go for my own sister. One thing I want you to know, Alice, is that you are our special love-child. - And I am your father. - But you're not my biological father. And I've always known that. - Have you always known? - I'm not stupid, Mum. I'm not. I know... So who is Alice's real father, then? His name's... - José. - José? José? I am not Spanish. He's not Spanish. He's American. His real name's James. José's his stage name. I hung out a lot with José. I don't get it. When did you have time for that? When we were in New York. A one-night stand. - Were you also sleeping with him? - Yes, but not at the same time. Alice, would you like to meet him? He doesn't know he has a daughter- - but if you want to meet him I can try to find him. I don't want to know any more, thank you. You're my dad, and that's it. I should have told him a long time ago, and I regret not doing so. I should have told everyone, but I kept my mouth shut. And I'm sorry I did. I should have told you. I already knew about Alice Zander. Hang on a second... You knew about Alice? How? I found her letter. When House of Angels was still standing we planned to move here. We were going to set up a business, a kind of 80's alternative health shop. What are you doing? Stop this. It's embarrassing to sit like this. I'm sorry you have to witness this, but this is just wrong. It's sick. How can you sit here like this? - I don't understand you, Alice. - No, you don't understand a thing. What do you want, Alice? I want to live somewhere. I want to live here where I have family. - We've sorted out so much now. - Alice, we have dreams too. You have dreams! You've dreamt a lot. But have you ever managed to do anything about those dreams? No, exactly. Sometimes you have to look in the mirror. Good morning! Henning? Henning? Fanny! Henning left you a letter. I also got one. Dear Fanny. You have to look back to go forward. Do you remember my saying that? Yesterday, I saw Alice's desperate cry for understanding - - so that she could move on in her life. To find a sense of belonging. Her light suddenly revealed to me my own darkness, my own stagnant life. A life stuck in the past. She made me take a step into the unknown, at last. The beginning of my future. I am leaving the White House to you, as I know it will be in good hands. It's all yours. Enjoy life. Henning. What has he written to you? I think he's left us. Yes, it would seem so. Do you think he'll be coming back? No. I'll miss him. Kristoffer, it says here: "I beg your forgiveness for treating you unfairly." I love him. In spite of everything. I suppose we must be happy for him. He's chosen his path in life. Do you want this house? Yes. Though I don't know... - What's happened? You look white. - Haven't you heard? - No, what? - Henning has left the village. - Are you pulling my leg? - No, it's true. Is Henning at home? No, I'm afraid not. - Fanny, then? - Yes, Fanny's here. - Kristoffer, right? - In person. Kristoffer... You asked where Henning was. "Dear Fanny..." Well, I'll be. - About time too. - About time? I've been waiting ages for him to become his own man. Good luck to him, I say. Good luck. So this vicarage is now yours. Yes. Though I'm not so sure about "vicarage"... And what will you do with House of Angels? - It'll give its name to this place. - Really? Why? I have a dream. I'm all ears. Many years ago I had plans for House of Angels. I was going to open a place of refuge, not just for myself and Zac - - but for many others, who could come here to the village. This is perfect! Say that we have 10 rooms. People could come here, go fishing, go swimming, have massages - - have a manicure, a pedicure... Come on Fanny. We're right out in the middle of nowhere. Who'd come all the way out here to the end of the world? - The Germans. - Germans. I see you've given this some thought. Germans are always useful. But it won't be cheap. I figured I'd get some money by selling the hotel in Mallorca. It's been making a loss recently so I won't get much, but it'll be something. Then I thought I'd sell the land where the house stood. - Sell the land? No way. - Why not? It'd be stupid. The value will go up and you'll need that money later on. If you want my advice, don't sell. - Why should I listen to you? - Because I'm your father. Because I'm wise. Maybe today is one of those miracle days? Ivar and I have talked and come to an agreement on shared paternity. Of you, I mean. And we wondered why you should wait to get your inheritance until we die? That could take for ever. Ivar will make it to at least 125. Ad so we've drawn up a deed of gift, and this is it. With Ivar's property and a third of mine. Here you are. - What will Marten and Vendela say? - I don't care. They'll get their share. - Why now? - Why? My dear girl, don't you understand? We want you you to stay here, in this village. We need light. For once in our lives we can do something sustainable, concrete... ...and worthwhile. For her sake, if nothing else. You promise not to leave us this time. If we're going to do this, we'll need the village on our side. So I'm actually going to speak to the women. The women? Annki... Picture her spa, with her massage bench and vibrating machine. She can have it here instead. And make something bigger of it. She was a good masseuse, right? Eva. OK, she has Marten to put up with... ...but she doesn't only run the farm. They've got God knows how many cows, but admittedly she doesn't milk them. She does all this and she's involved in the church... She's everywhere, controlling everyone, and she can do that here too. Not you and me, but still, we'll need a firm hand at the helm, right? Eva. - Mona. - Mona? - "Business woman of the year". - What makes you say that? - In the shop. - The tulips? Yes. She'd walk over corpses to sell those tulips. She'd already cut a deal with Annki and then acted all innocent. She's just what we need. A little business sense, which we don't have. Fanny, five felt tulips are not quite the same as running this business! Five felt tulips are a symbol of being able to run the place properly. - What do you say? - It'll be tough getting them on board. I just want you in on it, that's all. I want us to do this together. Annki, you're struggling, aren't you. We can do it here! Eva, I'm impressed by how you run this farm, sit on the church council... It's fantastic. Can you join us? And I've seen a business woman in you too. Haven't I. Trying to sell me felt flowers... - Matted wool. - Matted wool. ...in a way that means you can sell this house. I'd like you to read this. In it I offer you co-ownership and a percentage of the profits. - What do you say? - I think it's fantastic. It sounds exciting... I'm not sure if this will work... I knew you'd say that. You're so negative the whole time. Fanny, could you leave us alone for a moment? I think we're going to need to talk about this. Of course. - How's it going? - I don't know. They sent me out. - Don't worry, it's always like that. - What? That you get sent out like that. - I think you're being stupid. - Well if you think that... I don't think that. I think you are being stupid. - What? I haven't been stupid! - Let's look at the papers. I'm just telling Eva that it's a shame she can never open up. Things happen to us when they come, don't they. You get upset and irritated and close up. Try to open up instead. Annki, you weren't around then but OK. Call her in. Let's talk. - You won't let me down this time? - I'm with you all the way. - Me too. - That was a surprise. Fanny! - I wonder what they're going to say. - They're going to say Yes. Well? Before we start, I've been asked to apologise for being so negative. - It was stupid of me. - So you're in? - We think it's a great idea. - It's incredible. It sounds fantastic. But I for one... - I can't afford it. - We've got no money. What I want is your skills. I don't want your money. But... Co-ownership is... The investment is you and your skills. And what we can make of this together. The money I've inherited. - That's a whole new kettle of fish. - Of tulips! - What do you say? - It's incredible. What fun! It is a little exciting. - Is that a Yes? - It's a resounding Yes! - Cheers! - Cheers! To House of Angels! See? A miracle! I was wondering whose car this was. I'd never have guessed it was you two. - Whose is it? - Mine. A hobby. I'm trying out a gardening hobby here but I think I need greener fingers. - You look perky. - Well I'm not, not after last night! We heard. The old ladies indoors aren't as they should be. - In what way? - They're a bit of a waste of space. - A waste of space? - Not much to hang on the Xmas tree! But boy can they babble. Babble? It's said you're turning all this into an amusement park. A little Disneyland... - Is it true? - What? That you're going to turn this into a playground. In that case, a playground for adults. - Stockholmers? - Stockholmers would be great... ...but preferably from all over the world. - A lot of work. Will you have a pool? - The lake will do fine. - An old house. Costs. - Many windows to repair. I've got some spare cash. I could help you. Are you doing this because we're family? - Sis. - Bro. - Shall we get it on paper or what? - That won't be necessary. We're siblings. That'll do for me. I stand in front of you for the first time. And I don't really know what to say. But I... But I... But I will let God's voice speak through me. The peace of the Lord be with you all. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen. Go in peace. - How long will you be gone? - We can't stay too long. I hope things will go quickly, because Alice will be starting school here. Hang on. Alice doesn't even need to go. She can stay with me. She can stay with me. I live next to the school. Why should she stay with you when she can stay with me? I can drive her. - It was my idea, Ivar. - I still live closer. - If we have shared grandpaternity... - Please, can't you just...? If this is to work, you can't keep on like this. I hope it goes quickly. To be honest, the bank owns most of the hotel. Listen to me now, Fanny. I have an old friend living on Mallorca who's an estate agent. His name's Anton Wahlbeck. He can help you get the best price. - I read about him in the paper. - Anton Wahlbeck. Isn't he in prison? That's as maybe, but he's good. - How are you getting to the airport? - We'll take the old Volvo. The Volvo? Henning's old Volvo? It's a death trap! - It's also a killer car! - What? A killer car? Sure! It was the one Henning was driving when he ran over your grandpa. But someone had shot the windscreen, hadn't they? So that's all sorted. Thursday, painter. Friday, electrician. - Monday... - Åke will take care of it. Åke Knapp. Builder. He'll take care of it. You'll love him. - Will you manage alone? - Sure. - We'll be back. - I should hope so. Alice... I love you, Kristoffer. Why should you deny so one single quiet little flirt. That moment might never return. Why should you deny so one single little secret kiss. That kiss might never return. Who can restrain the lips that yearn or a longing with a passion that burns. "Erik Gustaf Zander and his beloved daughter, Alice". My beloved daughter, Alice. See you soon. I know someone who'd have been happy to see the house back: Gottfrid. Dear Gottfrid, you'd have been there the whole time, wouldn't you. - Do we really fit in here, Alice? - I do, at least. Then I do too. But him... Does he fit in here?
