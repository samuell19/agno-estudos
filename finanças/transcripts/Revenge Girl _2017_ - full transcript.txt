This year's Miss Campus Grand Prix winner is… Number 5, an economics major from the University of Tokyo, Takaraishi Miki! Miss Takaraishi has been awarded the winner's tiara. And now, her acceptance speech. I'll begin by explaining something simple to everyone here. Me winning the Grand Prix… was completely obvious! For years, this competition has had some pretty low standards. So, this year, I decided to enter to show all of you what true beauty really is. And, a word to my so-called competitors, don't cry. And don't let this discourage you. You know why you lost. And, if not, just take a good look in the mirror, and you'll understand. You were all simply outmatched. That's all there was to it. Therefore… I'm delighted to accept this crown! Clap now. That was Miss Takaraishi Miki. What a total bitch! She's an amateur model who got online votes. So what? What, really? Now, look here, girls. If you have something to say about me, why not say it to my face instead of behind my back? And now it's time to move on to the after-party celebration. Contestants, please make your way across the stage. Mariko! We love you! Thank you. I can't blame you. You're not used to being in the presence of such overwhelming beauty. Not in a million years could you… GOOD LUCK, MARIKO Thank you so much… for saving me. Sorry. I've never seen such beauty before. And then you two went out to gaze at the sea, right? You've told me this story a thousand times. I'm trying to share my happiness with you. Show some gratitude! I must say, Miki, you've got a new glow. Thanks to your first-ever boyfriend, that is. It's not thanks to him, it's thanks to me! For letting him be my boyfriend. Oh, come on. To be honest, though, I've never felt so happy before. When I think about Hiromasa, I get this warm fuzzy feeling deep inside of me. It feels like bliss, with a little bit of pain. Miki, that's what people call love, you know. I just never expected to meet someone so wonderful. A Harvard graduate who's handsome and thoughtful, and let's not forget he's from a powerful political family. He's just perfect in every way. I'd stop time right now. But aren't you a little bit worried? Worried? That he might cheat on you 'cause he's such a catch. Oh, Misaki. You're so funny, you know that? Cheat on me? Me! I'm Takaraishi Miki! I mean, who would ever dream of cheating on me? That's funny. That's never gonna happen. ONE YEAR LATER BULGARI - Ciao, Miki. - Ciao. You have a meeting today in the Terra Plaza. - Thanks. I'll see you later? - Thank you. Thanks. Hiromasa? INCOMING CALL HIROMASA - Hello? - Sorry to call you at work. - Are you free tomorrow? - I can be. For what? You don't remember? Tomorrow, is the one-year anniversary of when we first met, right? I wanna spend some time with you on our special day. Hiromasa. So, I was thinking… How about the Miss Campus after-party? Sure, but why there? I want as many people as possible to celebrate our anniversary. - Especially since… - Since what? I'll save that for later. Miki? We're gonna start soon. Sorry. I'll call you later. Hiromasa. What could he be planning? I don't know! You look like you're having fun. That reminds me… Your cute boyfriend visited our flagship store the other day. - My Hiromasa did? - Yeah. He bought… a diamond ring. "H heart M." That's what he had engraved on it. He wanted it to be ready by tomorrow. What could that mean? Miki… Marry me. A surprise proposal? Tomorrow's our one-year anniversary, a ring engraved with initials, and he has something important to say to me? It's a sure thing! Sounds like it. So then, my big sis is getting married. I've already gone and ordered my new business cards. - And asked my boss to be our MC. - That was quick. That's right, I'd better get started on our honeymoon reservations! Hold on. What am I going to wear tomorrow? For a proposal, I need to make sure that I have the perfect outfit, right? Hiromasa might be wearing a tuxedo! I never could have won Miss Campus Grand Prix without the support of family and friends and so many of you here. With undying gratitude and humility, I accept this honor… Look how pretty she is! Maybe… This is a little too plain. Thank you. Hiromasa? Hiromasa, where are you? Hasn't he arrived yet? Hello, Miki! It's been so long. Sorry, who are you? I'm Nakategawa Mariko. I was last year's runner-up. I'm sorry. I try to erase all unnecessary information from my memory, you see. So, you're taking a walk down memory lane today? What a coincidence, so am I. Working in TV broadcasting just keeps me so busy. But they gave me the day off, so I decided I'd pop by. But I never expected to see you here. Hiromasa, you here? Hiro! Come on out! - Excuse me. - What do you want? Can I help you with something? Saito Hiromasa. Can you find him for me? - And who should I tell him you are? - Just go fetch Hiromasa. Of course. Would you mind… He's here, isn't he? - What are you talking about? - Excuse me. Why do you need Hiromasa? - Who are you? - Takaraishi Miki. You could say that I'm his… fiancée, I suppose. So you're the "Miss Campus Grand Prix"? Poor you. Can't you see I'm pregnant? Congrats. When you see Hiro, tell him that he's going to be a father. I can hardly believe the lies a woman will tell to get Hiromasa's attention. You don't know how many different women he has, do you? You're just one of many. It's ridiculous to think he'd have any other women. You obviously don't know me. I'm Takaraishi Miki. Forget it, I'll tell him myself. Pitiful. Must be Hiromasa. Thanks. Work is stressful. I need your smiling face to soothe me. Hiromasa cheating on me is about as likely as hell freezing over. Miki! Could you help me take a photo, please? Work is stressful. I need your smiling face to soothe me. You don't know how many different women he has, do you? You're just one of many. TODAY'S LECTURE Well, here we are. Thank you. - Thank you, Councilor Saito. - Call me anytime. - I certainly will. Thank you. - My pleasure. Hiromasa! Your grandson's as popular as ever. Hiromasa! I'll go ahead. Sure. Hiromasa, can I just say your speech was fascinating. Thank you. You have to promise to run in the next election, okay? I'll do my best. You'll definitely win! You're a member of the Saito family after all! You're too kind. I promise that I'll win for all of you. - We're behind you! - I'll do my best. - Shake my hand! - Thank you very much. It's you again. Not that I care, but are you okay? 'Cause you look terrible. So, do you finally believe me now? It must be some kind of mistake, and I'm only here to confirm that it is. - Please change the future of Japan. - I'll try my best. His secretary gave me this. I'm supposed to pretend nothing happened. - He paid you off? - Put that away. He's that kind of guy. That's impossible. This all has to be some kind of mistake! Thank you very much. Let me through, please. Miki. What happened? Someone told me you were seeing other women, but that's a lie, right? The text messages you sent to all those women, you didn't mean to do it, right? It was some kind of phone glitch! How about we calm down, okay? Looks like you could use some cleaning up, doesn't it? How much do you want? See, we're prepared to fulfill any requested amount. Just look back on your time with him as a fond memory. You can shove your offers! You think I want your money? Then what do you want? Don't tell me you thought he was serious about a girl like you? What about the proposal? You were gonna propose, right? I know you went to Bulgari, and had a ring engraved with "H heart M." That one wasn't for you. Today's Mio's birthday. Not Mio's, sir. - Nakategawa Mariko's birthday. - Right. Mariko. Then, why did you want me to go to that party today? I was just curious. I wanted to see all the women who love me in one place. Mr. Casanova of the 21st century! Wait! Hold it right there! - Wait! Hey! - Drive. Just open the window! Wait! Hey! Stop that car, Saito Hiromasa! Just who do you think I am? Takaraishi Miki, the University of Tokyo's top student, Miss Campus Grand Prix winner, and a cover girl for NaNa Magazine for three years running! I work in Bulgari's Public Relations department! How dare you even consider ignoring me! Who do you think you are? How pathetic! What did you just say to me? I'm sure what you meant to say was, "How perfect." I think I must have misheard you. No need to waste your breath. What do you mean? Your outrage won't matter to the heir of such a powerful political family. Just wait and see! I'm gonna make him want me again, then toss him out like old garbage. - I definitely am. - Impossible. I will! I've gotten everything I've ever wanted and… Then why don't you get elected Prime Minister? What? That's the only way you'll ever get your revenge. All right, I will. REVENGE GIRL And now, a few words from our guest lecturer and Legislature Secretary, Ms. Kisaragi. ASUNARO SCHOOL OF POLITICS ENTRANCE CEREMONY Students, congratulations on your acceptance to this school. From this day forward, I encourage you all to study hard so you can guide our country's future - as upstanding lawmakers… - Excuse me, miss! You can't just barge in here. Hey. Please! Attention! University of Tokyo Graduate in economics, and Miss Campus winner, Takaraishi Miki, age 24. I'm here to declare my intention to become Prime Minister. To that purpose, I've decided that I'm going to study here with you. Thank you. Nice to meet you. Miss, if you please. Wait! Miss, please wait! I'm very well suited to the life of a politician, so you've got to let me in. You'll regret it, if you don't. I'm serious. I quit my job at Bulgari today. I demand that you enroll me immediately. I'm afraid this year's entrance exams are already over. Make an exception for me. Sorry, that's not possible. It's the duty of a lawmaker to follow the rules. Leave immediately! - Hey, it's you from yesterday! - We'll see you next year. - We're very sorry. - Take your hands off of me! Now, please leave. How dare they kick me out! Really! I've never seen such rude people before! They'd be idiots to keep me out. That old hag of a political secretary didn't look all that talented to me. They sure have a lot of nerve to ask me, Takaraishi Miki, to leave. They're all insane. Sorry for being an old hag. I've seen my fair share of politicians, and over 30 political campaigns in my time. Basically, all politicians tend to be more or less the same. But… a girl like you would be a first. What are you trying to say? Do you want to be Prime Minister because Saito Hiromasa dumped you? For revenge. You're a very interesting person. Would you like me to help you become Prime Minister? Absolutely not! Why would I need help from a guy like that? I have to agree with her. - It's a complete waste of my time. - A waste of your time? - I'm going to be Prime Minister. - You? Never. Even with such rare beauty and intelligence? Like I said. A lawmaker needs to have a certain kind of love! A certain kind of love? You could learn something from her. MARIKO'S WEATHER FORECAST There you go! This was Mariko's Mari! Mari! Weather Report! Be sure to stay tuned for Yoshi's Fashion Check. And now, back to the studio. You've gotta be kidding me! I can feel my IQ dropping just from looking at her. What could that girl have over me? Like I said, you could learn from her. Miss Kisaragi! Listen. If you want to be Prime Minister, first you have to be elected to the legislature. Understand? And you can't do it alone. Do you have any friends who could help you with your campaign? I have a class to teach, so I can't sit here and babysit you. But Mr. Kadowaki, here, he's office staff. He's very versatile and has experience helping many rookie politicians get elected. A competent political aide. Him? That's right. I trained him from scratch. I feel safe leaving you in his hands. Right? You'll help her, won't you, Mr. Kadowaki? I'm sorry. You know I'd do anything for you, but not this. Hey. Come on. Don't you think you've been spinning your wheels long enough? When are you going resume your calling as a great political aide? When I've met a politician worthy of my full devotion. And not before that. In your current state, you're never going to meet that politician. You have to be able to turn any candidate into a winner! Because that's what a top aide does. I understand. But… I'm out the moment you refuse to do what I say. Fine, then. It's a deal. It's only an election, right? You can begin by cleaning this place, and I expect it to be sparkling clean. Cleaning? What? Cleaning and politics are the same thing. Let me tell you about some election basics. You need three things, a base, a name, and a purse. What do you take me for, an idiot? Everybody knows that. You'll follow my instructions, or I'm out. All I said was I already knew that. I don't care about how much you think you know. So, shall we continue? Louder, please. Yeah. Use "Yes" or "No." Yes! "Base" refers to supporters and support groups. Name is recognition. Purse is money. At the moment, you have none of these things. But… even someone like you can find a way to win, you need to be endorsed by a major political party. Endorsed? Major party endorsement would make campaign subsidies available to you and guarantee the votes of other party members. If you were backed by the largest party, the DFP, that would cover everything you need. Your chances of winning would be very good. Then, it's easy. I'll just go for the DFP's endorsement. Don't get cocky! Endorsements don't come easy. Thank you very much. Two weeks from Monday, right? I understand. Yes, I look forward to it. The paperwork's complete, so all I've got to do now is to pass the interview. Naturally. But the final interview is where the real hurdles lie. Because they'll want to gauge your ability to get votes. That'll be no problem. I modeled for a magazine with lots of fans. You mean social media followers? Do you really think I'd be so silly? I'm not the kind of person who needs to beg for other people's attention. Then, you don't have that many fans. Are you calling me a liar? I'm afraid Kadowaki's right. You may have many fans, but without the numbers to prove it, nobody's going to believe you. But it might not be too late to start. If you started using Instagram, I'm sure that you, with your looks and your fashion sense, could attract a lot of followers. Well, of course I could. I'm sure I could get thousands of followers in no time… Three hundred thousand by interview time? Three hundred thousand? And in only two weeks' time? - That's a bit high, don't you think? - Yes, you're right. A person like her doesn't have that much appeal. You just wait and see! Three hundred thousand followers in two weeks! I'll have them by then. Misaki. Take my picture. Later. Okay? Hey, don't! On Instagram, traffic peaks between 9:00 and 10:00 in the evening. There's still time left. I'm giving it my all. - Ready? - Okay. Take the photo as I turn around. And now! I need a little more rouge right there under the eyelids. And blend around the cheeks, a bit of orange. - Keep up! - I'm trying to, but I'm exhausted! Come on. Keep up! Wow, it looks so good! Misaki, snap a pic of me looking good. Look, Tokyo Tower. I know that's Tokyo Tower. Ready? - "Today I'm in a high-fashion mood…" - Take a beautiful photo. "On my neck, I'm wearing Bulgari's Perfect Mistake." "It says here that each and every mistake in life can be turned into a beautiful opportunity." "But I never make any mistakes." Hey. Don't put in that last line! Why not? - You don't need it. - Hold on! - Here, let me. - Wait, wait! She's posting something new every single day, but 300,000 followers is just too high. I already knew that. You chose an unattainable number so she'd have no choice but to quit, and you'd get rid of her. She doesn't have what it takes to win an election. A politician's ability to win depends on the aide. I know you, and I understand your disgust with lying, self-serving politicians. But she's not one of them, is she? Are you saying it isn't self-serving to run for office just to get back at a boyfriend? She didn't lie about it, though. Good morning, everyone. Morning. The DFP lectures are coming up soon. I expect you both to be there. As I said on the phone, for the next upper house elections, I'd like to see my grandson, Hiromasa, in the running. We want you to be the election campaign manager of Hiromasa. I'm honored by the offer, but I must decline. I'm already involved in another candidate's campaign at the moment. Who's the candidate you're helping? It's a first-timer. Takaraishi Miki. DFP SPECIAL LECTURE You'll need to memorize the party platform by tomorrow. - Yes, yes, I will. - One "yes" will do! Yes. "Fried Pork Cutlet. Free soup with a filled out points card"? That's mine! Okay, just… Hey, hold on! Let me under there with you! - Wait up. - Please take one. Take one, please. Please take one. Take one, please. Take one, please. Take one, please. - Take one, please. - Hey! Take one, please. What are you doing out here? Isn't it obvious? Why keep the baby? I already spent all the money he gave me. - Don't stand here. Go and get warm. - No, I won't! Maybe I look like a pathetic poor person to someone as rich as you, but at least I'm getting 6,000 yen a day to live on! Whether you're being sincere or not, I don't need sympathy from you. Yeah… I do pity you. You're standing out here in the rain, handing out tissues, pregnant. It's pitiful… and stupid. I feel very sorry for you. Are you trying to start a fight? No, but I don't believe in lying. Give me that. Now watch and learn how someone like me does it. Thirty minutes, and I'll earn the 6,000 you make in a day. You couldn't possibly do that in 30 minutes… There's nothing I can't do. Don't write me off until I'm finished. Please, take one. Please, take one. Please, take one. Please, take one. Please, take one. It'll take 15 minutes with two people. Be smart about it. Please, take one. Please, take one. Take one, please! Excuse me. Please! - Good morning. - Good morning. Good morning. - Morning. - Let's go. - Wait. Wait. Go where? - The TV station. Two interviews this morning, then a radio interview, and a livestream in the evening. So many? You want more followers, right? Yeah, but… Okay, wait up. Over 300,000 followers. Congrats! Looks like the added exposure doubled your followers. Good work, Kadowaki. Just following the playbook. I guess I'm popular after all. That should earn you a lot of points at the interview tomorrow. Now, just practice what you're going to say. I'm confident I'll pass it. - Good luck. - Thanks. Here. Take this. You're done with your homework today. Go home and rest. Okay, right after I review the interview questions that Ms. Kisaragi prepared. You just did that. Wouldn't hurt to do it again. I want to make sure I don't blow it. Hey, what are you… Let's meet at the fried pork place at 7:00. Fried pork before the fight. I'll even throw in the soup. Wait, what? Don't misunderstand. It's just that my points card is full now. What just… Did he just invite me to dinner? What do I do? What? That's totally a date, sis. No way he meant it like that. No way. I mean, this guy's not the dating type. Okay, then why'd you even call to ask me about it? It's because you think it's a date, but you wanted to be sure. No way! I called to talk, that's all! But if you're just gonna talk nonsense, then forget it! It can't be a date. It can't be a date. It can't be a date. Why'd I say that to Misaki? INCOMING CALL SAITO HIROMASA Lawmakers are expected to be punctual. I'm sorry. I can't come. My sister's feeling ill. I'm so sorry. Will your sister be all right? Then, you take care, too. It's important to stay healthy during a campaign. See you tomorrow, then. - Welcome back, Miki. - Thank you. Why did you call me out of the blue? If there's something you want, just tell me. I'm sorry. The truth is that… I wanted to marry you, Miki. But you see, my family won't let me choose for myself. It's a little late. I'm pathetic. Not standing up to them… and hurting someone I care about. Join me for a drink at my place. I see. I don't think that I can forgive you. But I'm glad you apologized. Thank you. So, truce? Bye. - Good morning. - Good morning. Good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning. Good morning. Morning. You saw him last night, didn't you? SAITO HIROMASA Today's interview got canceled. We just got the call. What? Listen. The DFP is an old-fashioned party run by a bunch of elderly executives. A photo with an opposing party candidate is very damaging. It can easily be seen as a betrayal. So, they won't endorse me as a candidate? No, of course they won't! What in the world were you thinking? And at a time like this! I thought you were smarter than this. Wait a minute, please! Sis? "Opportunity with every mistake." Right, then! I'll show them all! What's gotten into you? What's wrong? Think you can get rid of me? Think you can get rid of me? Don't you understand by now? I'm Takaraishi Miki. I don't lose, so don't mess with me! You better believe I'll get my revenge! 2ND FLOOR SPORTS & BLUE SKY PARTY - Excuse me. - Wait. - Wait. - Hey, wait a minute. Excuse me, do you mind? Just let me through! Hello there, I'm Takaraishi Miki. I'd like you to endorse me as your candidate. Sorry, but… you see, we've already chosen our official candidate. - I'm sorry. - Really? And our slogan is this. - What's this? - It's Ranch! Ranch? What ranch is that? Wait, what does that even mean? How's that supposed to be related to sports? IMPERIAL PARTY CONFERENCE ROOM I'd like to be endorsed as your candidate. With my beauty and intelligence, I, Takaraishi Miki, solemnly swear that I can be the next Prime Minister. You look to me like you have more… love of self than love of country. Get out! POWER TO LIVE ASSOCIATION Let me be your official legislature candidate. I'm Takaraishi Miki, and I promise I'll be the next Prime Minister. Your power is impressive, but I have to decline. - But I promise! - Sorry, but that's not really our thing. ANIMAL REVOLUTIONARY PARTY Excuse me. My name is Miki. I'm loved by people, but even more by animals. That doesn't seem to be quite true. Could you leave now? POLITICAL PARTIES SPORTS & BLUE SKY PARTY IMPERIAL PARTY POWER TO LIVE ASSOCIATION ANIMAL REVOLUTIONARY PARTY ECOLOGY & PEACE PARTY How much of an idiot can you be? You're willing to be endorsed by any party? I believe I can win even in a small party. Okay, but what's the point if you don't share that party's beliefs? Beliefs… BLUE HARMONY PARTY Blue Harmony Party? Their candidate had to drop out due to an illness. And they're looking for a replacement. I already spoke with them. But why? Because I realized that a girl like you won't give up so easily. I'm sorry! About… About the other day. You know you shouldn't lie. Don't be like all the other politicians! Because, to be brutally honest, being a bit cringe, but straightforward, that's your strength. Who do you think you are? No one talks to me that way! If you're going to talk back… - Wait. - I can make this deal disappear. Hey! I was just kidding! I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry! Come on! Give it back. I'll do whatever you say. I promise! I'm begging you. Please? BLUE HARMONY PARTY We wish to convey our most sincere gratitude for endorsing Takaraishi Miki. Thank you very much. No, no. The pleasure is all ours, someone so young and pretty. And with Mr. Kadowaki, too. I think we should be the ones who are grateful to you. - Please, have a seat. - Thank you. Thank you. Right! Kawaguchi, let's serve them a bit of that baumkuchen from yesterday. It's quite tasty. It's a tasty cake. A party like ours always has some trouble with recruitment. Especially in an election like this. You'll be going up against the son of Councilor Saito from Kanagawa District 19. A single-seat legislature district. But we're ready to take on Saito Hiromasa. What's wrong? You're here to win, right? Damn right. I am. Don't forget who you're talking to here. I'm Takaraishi Miki! All right! That's the spirit! Please, try some. - Put them in the back, please. - Yes. - Should we take this out over here? - Yes, please. TAKARAISHI MIKI - Hello, Miki? - Yes? - You've got some visitors here. - Yeah! You've got your HQ. Congratulations. - Congratulations. - Thank you very much. This is really great. I've kept in mind what you told me. A politician's ability to win depends on the aide. Thank you so much. I promise that I'll see her win this. Just know that I won't forgive a black mark on my record. Got it. You're so pretty. You'll definitely win. Excuse me. Thank you so much for coming. It's our pleasure. First, we need to get a car and get the campaign office set up. Then we get started on making pamphlets and posters. We officially submit our candidacy 12 days before election day. SAITO HIROMASA And posters will go up on 300 prefecture boards. Please take one. Take one, please. Make sure to make eye contact when passing out the fliers. Right. Don't forget to say, "Please vote for Takaraishi Miki." - Good morning. - Good morning. But… What is it? I'm thinking my name might be kind of hard to remember, so maybe I should try to boost the charm? With my good looks, for example. Try giving a speech. Do it! - Like, right now? - Yes. Let's go. Yes. I'm Takaraishi Miki with the Blue Harmony Party. Sparkling beautifully before you like a diamond. I'm Takaraishi Miki. Remember my name, Takaraishi Miki, when you vote. I can't accomplish anything by myself, but with help and support from all of you, we can create a beautiful society together. So vote Takaraishi Miki. I'm Takaraishi Miki, sparkling beautifully before you like a diamond. I'm your diamond, sparkling beautifully, Takaraishi Miki. Miki of the Blue Harmony Party. - I humbly request your support. - Good luck! Good luck! TAKARAISHI MIKI OFFICIAL CANDIDATE OF THE BLUE HARMONY PARTY TAKARAISHI MIKI 13 DAYS TO ELECTION Vote for Takaraishi Miki, please. Thank you very much. You okay? Not much of a crowd, huh? Well, my Instagram following's increasing. Even so, your ability to appeal to the voters directly seems to be somewhat lacking, doesn't it? My ability is lacking? That was Mariko's Mari! Mari! Weather Report! And now, everyone, there's something I need to tell you. As of today, I, Nakategawa Mariko, am leaving broadcasting. I want to thank you all for your undying support! We love you, Mariko! We'll all miss you here. And you know you have so many viewers who love you out there, Mariko. Help you win an election? You quit broadcasting, right? My older colleagues were just too mean. The jealousy of some women can really be a scary thing. Then, until you find a new job… It's really strange, isn't it? Us chilling at a cafe. Don't you remember at the pageant? And then again at the party the next year? It seems like you want my popularity and fame, just to help you win more votes. Am I right? Why are you running for office, anyway? It's politics. Why not leave that boring stuff for the old women and men? Don't tell me… it's because of Hiromasa. If you want my advice, you should erase him from your memory. Playing at revenge like that. It's a stupid thing to do… I already know! I already know it's stupid. But… when I decide on something, I always see it through. If I quit now, I'll just be giving him what he wants. And that's… That's just not Takaraishi Miki! But how could I possibly help you? I beg you! Miss Nakategawa Mariko. I beg you to help me! What are you doing, Miki? Please get up! But I really need your strength! Please help me, Mariko! I beg you! Please! I need you more than anyone now, so please! Please. Please. Please. Please. Please. Help me. Hey, so many people. Drawing a crowd is essential in a campaign. It's a basic rule. Okay, but where did all these people come from? Miss Nakategawa's friends. Look, you all showed up! That makes me super happy. Thanks so much, everybody! Remember. It's really important to always show just how grateful you are. Like I just did. I don't know if I… You do want people to love you, don't you? I'll do it. So, are you Takaraishi Miki? I am! You're quite a young candidate, aren't you? You really think so? I was once young and pretty like you are now, you know. Really? That's so sweet! - And I was quite popular with the boys. - I can't believe it! Miki, I don't think you're doing that right. Thank you so much. You're so cute, aren't you? Citizens of Sakae Town, we'll fight for you. So, please vote for Takaraishi Miki. - That's Takaraishi Miki. - Hey, lady! Excuse me, lady! "Lady"? Can you help me open this up? Why don't you go and ask your mom, okay? Now, excuse me. See this tab? A pull tab works on a principle known as "leverage." So… when you have a greater distance between the fulcrum here and the point of force where you pull, then you don't need to use as much force. And there you have it. Here you are. Amazing, lady! Thanks a lot! - Thanks! - Thanks, lady! - Thanks, lady! - Thanks a lot! Takaraishi Miki. Takaraishi Miki is here at the Sakae Town shopping arcade. Once her grandchild was born, her cancer… 9 DAYS TO ELECTION - …had completely disappeared! - Wow! Is that really true? Yes, it's true! I heard it from a friend at the seniors' center. So, you mean, from the other day? Ms. Kikuyo, is that right? You remember? Well, of course. Hey, hey, lady! How do you make green peppers less bitter? Listen. Green peppers contain pyrazines and quercetin which are bitter-tasting compounds. The way you get rid of that is to cut them in half, and then let them air out for a few hours. After that, they won't taste as bitter, and be a lot nicer to eat. Awesome! Now, my dad's feet really stink sometimes. Why is that? I don't think I can help you with that one… I have one! "Beat cops." Does that mean they beat people up? "Beat" refers to the neighborhood they patrol, so, "beat cops" patrol neighborhoods. She's amazing! Great lady! Great lady! Great lady! Great lady! Great lady! Great lady! 7 DAYS TO ELECTION - Where are you going, Mr. Kadowaki? - To hand out fliers. - I have something to ask you. - What's up? Miki. What do you think of Toshiya? He does seem a little bit stiff. But he's actually really handsome, isn't he? You think so? I'm not seeing anyone, so I think I'll ask him out. What do you think? Why not? Great! In that case, I'm gonna ask him out tonight. Toshiya, wait up. Let me help you out! - Sure. - Let's do it together. TAKARAISHI MIKI BLUE HARMONY PARTY Welcome back. That was quick. I thought I'd finish here and come help you guys. Miss Nakategawa helped us. It's all done. It went quick because nobody ever refuses a flier from her. Why don't you go home and get some sleep? Shouldn't you be leaving as well? Don't you have a dinner with Miss Nakategawa? I don't have much interest in restaurants with a view. You don't, huh? - Here. - What? From Mr. Jinbo, the mayor. Good luck, Takaraishi Miki!! From Sakae Town I support you because you're straightforward! I was waiting for a person like Miki to run for election Something wrong? Nobody even realizes that this all started out of revenge. It's like… I'm deceiving them. WHY FEET STINK When I was little, I was bullied. Where'd this come from? The guy that bullied me became a city councilman later. So, I followed in the same path, hoping I could get back at him one day. But I wasn't cut out for it. So, I decided to become an aide to help others. Is that so? You sought revenge, too. No, I made that up. I was never bullied as a kid. In fact, I was scouted straight from a college political club, - which got me here. - Hold on. I don't get it. It doesn't matter what got you here! That's what I'm trying to tell you. Your motivation now has nothing to do with him. If you really do feel bad, find true happiness in the happiness of others. That's the kind of politician you should be. That's all. So, what's your favorite food? If someone cringe like you can pull this off, I'll treat you to dinner as a reward. Really? Then, it should be Korean barbecue, or sushi, or… The soup at the fried pork place is really good. Fine. I'll take your recommendation, then. I'll throw in a whole pork cutlet, too. Just this once. - Good morning! - Good morning! Today we're going to be speaking at a public hall, and then lunch with supporters. After that, we'll have a strategy meeting. - Please keep canvassing. - Right. It's good to finally see the old you again. - Well! The last push. Let's go get 'em. - Yes, ma'am! Breaking news! Miki, look! All of us here, as well as others, have suffered mental and physical damage because of Saito Hiromasa. SAITO HIROMASA VICTIMS' ASSOCIATION So we've decided to set up this Victims' Association to get justice for our grievances. The lady who was handing out tissues. But why is she doing this? Mr. Saito Hiromasa has been seeing a lot of women, and gotten a lot of them pregnant, and paid them off in an attempt to buy their silence. This is a candidate who treats women as nothing more than sex objects. Don't be fooled by this man. Don't put our country in the hands of someone like him. We must not let anyone who is so irresponsible run for national office! This will doom Hiromasa's campaign. You know that means we're sure to win now! Don't be so quick to assume. He's right. The Saitos have influence, and they'll use any means necessary to crawl out of this hole. SAITO HIROMASA All right! Listen up! We'll deny everything as baseless lies! You got it? Got it? Got it? Good. Okay, everyone. That's our story. Let's go! I don't care if the claims are true! We're here to win! Focus on winning and continue winning, and one day, you'll be the Saito family's first Prime Minister. A feat that I failed to achieve. Do you understand? Yes. 5 DAYS TO ELECTION We have a first-time candidate for public office, Takaraishi Miki. It must be quite tough, campaigning for the first time, wouldn't you say? Oh, no. The strong support I've received makes me feel almost invincible. However, something's been making news on the Internet recently. Miss Takaraishi, I wonder what you make of this? Have a look. Takaraishi Miki Rumors 1. Saito Hiromasa was her boyfriend! 2. She's running because she was dumped! 3. She organized the victims' association! What's this? They're claiming online that you actually dated your rival, Mr. Saito Hiromasa, the candidate running against you in the 19th electoral district. Is there any truth to this rumor? Did you ever date Saito? There's also a cozy Instagram photo of the two of you that recently surfaced. I wonder, does your entering the race have anything to do with that? Would you care to address this rumor, Miss Takaraishi? Please tell us. Mr. Saito! Is it true that you dated Miss Takaraishi? Out of respect for my rival, I have no comment. Then it's true, right? I'll take the blame for any misunderstanding. There've been some rumors that candidate Takaraishi is the one behind the victims' association. I'm sorry, I have nothing to say except that I want this to be a fair election. SURPRISE INTERVIEW WITH SAITO HIROMASA Please tell us more! Mr. Saito's comments seem to hint that Takaraishi Miki was an instigator. I know him. He's one of Hiromasa's guys. Are you saying it was all staged? It looks like that. Disgusting. We need to do something. Our followers are dropping already. And Toshiya hasn't even returned from meeting with the supporters yet. Miki. Help! - Hey! - Is she okay? Hey! What happened? Somebody clear the sofa for them. - Got it. - Bring me a blanket, okay? Okay. Got it! Are you okay? What happened? People are calling me a liar online and they're accusing me of taking bribes from your campaign. I don't know where they're getting their information, but they know my name and where I live. Some people came to my place, so now I can't even go back home with my baby. That's terrible. Seeing you out there working so hard, I felt like I should do something, too. But look where that's gotten me. I'm such a fool. No, you're not a fool. There are lots of fools out there, but not you. Where are you going? Wait, wait! Miki! Where are you going? Miki! I believe your election's in the bag, Hiromasa. Support for Takaraishi Miki is already tanking, as expected. That's what she gets for meddling. Serves her right. Go easier on her. She's trying her best as a fringe candidate. Fringe, indeed. Hey, you can't come in here! Hey! Stop! What do you want? Just how low can you go, Hiromasa? - About what? - Don't play dumb. All that slander online. I know it was all your doing. What are you laughing at? You don't know the first thing about politics. I'm amazed you even got this far. But you're way out of your depth here. I'm the Saito family heir. I was born to become the Prime Minister. So, I have to do whatever it takes to win this election. I'm sorry, but that's wrong. Just think of all the people you've duped to win this thing! Think of all the women that you've hurt! Think of Rinko! I mean, she had your baby, and now she's too scared to go home! Rinko? Who the hell is that? Lies are a part of politics. You can't blame me for that. You being duped is your own fault. You and all those other women. If you want to beat me, you'll have to be much smarter than this. Now that you get it, just drop out. You're just wasting your time and money on a lost cause. You think I'd ever allow some woman to win against me? Hey, didn't you just tell us to go easy? Remind me never to cross you. Yeah, you're on fire today. So, who's that Rinko chick she mentioned? I don't even remember. Wait, didn't I pay her off a while back? You can go to hell! Go to hell! Oh, no! Help! Why did you… If you humiliate her again… you'll answer to me. Oh, man! I hope you realize what you've done. - Daring to resort to physical violence? - Fortunately… I'm no longer an aide. Wait. What do you mean? You can win this on your own. What? - That's the guy! - Hey! Don't move! - Hey! - Come with us. - Move! - Hey! Hold on! Hey! Hey! Wait! What do you mean I can win this thing on my own? Tell me! All right. Come on. Tell me! Hey! Tell me! FRIED PORK CUTLET As for Kadowaki, I convinced the other side not to go public with his actions. LETTER OF RESIGNATION It would only hurt both our campaigns. Kadowaki has already resigned, citing personal reasons. But why? Why can't I speak the truth? He was only trying to protect me. Do you want to win this or not? No matter how justified, no one is willing to support a candidate who resorts to physical violence! That's why Kadowaki did what he did. Can't you understand that? Kadowaki is still young, but he's always given everything to support his candidates, to make them into winners. But they always turned out to be disappointments. He lost faith in politicians and their lies. He felt betrayed. So, he just stopped working as an aide. But then he swore! He swore to me he'd make you a winner. Kadowaki swore it right to my face! He was finally back, and you ruined it. So, will you disappoint and betray him, too? Listen. You can do one thing for him. Just one thing. Win this election! In order to do that, you'll have to forget about him. Takaraishi Miki is here to… VOTE FOR TAKARAISHI MIKI The race between two young candidates from the 19th district, Takaraishi Miki and Saito Hiromasa, is turning into a fierce, high-profile battle with plenty of mudslinging on social networks. TAKARAISHI & SAITO NECK AND NECK BATTLE! The latest polls have them running neck and neck. Tomorrow, they'll be taking to the streets to give their final speeches. TAKARAISHI 1 DAY TO ELECTION THE LAST DAY!! I'm off to school. Miki? Your last big speech is coming up, huh? - That's right. - Something wrong? No. Nothing. - You look kind of worried. - Not at all. I'm going to win. - I have no reason to worry. Obviously. - I hope so. I don't want you to regret anything. I just mean, if you'll regret winning, then why run at all, you know? I'll be there later. Good luck. See you. First, thank you all for taking time out of your busy schedules to be here. - Go get 'em. - Sure. Today, we're honored to hear from our wonderful candidate… I want you to show me your… Our Blue Harmony Party's official candidate… …best speech ever. - Sure. - Takaraishi Miki's here today to… - It's time to go on. - Thanks. Allow me to introduce you to a person who always speaks honestly, and directly to you. Takaraishi Miki! Good afternoon, and thank you. I'm Takaraishi Miki, from the Blue Harmony Party. I've just been introduced as Takaraishi Miki, a candidate who speaks honestly and directly to the voters, but that isn't exactly true. As a matter of fact, I've been lying to all of you. If I were to win as things stand now, I'd probably regret it for the rest of my life. I want to tell all of the people who have supported me, that I don't want to win this election in a way I'll regret. Miki… The online rumors are true. I chose to run for Prime Minister out of selfish revenge. I wanted revenge on the man who betrayed me. On the man who dumped me. I wasn't thinking about the voters. I was only thinking about beating him. But, then… thanks to one person, I was able to change. This person told me I had no chance of winning an election because I couldn't win the people's love. That made me so angry, and I was so mean to him. But… despite my lousy attitude and my ignorance about how to win an election, he stood by me the whole way. Your motivation now is no longer about him. Because, to be brutally honest, being a bit cringe, but straightforward, that's your strength. And even after I betrayed his trust, he still believed in me, and came to my rescue. If you humiliate her again… you'll answer to me. Thanks to this person, I changed from someone who was only seeking revenge to someone who wants to win this election for the sake of all the people who have so graciously supported me. I made two promises to this man. To be a politician who never lies. And… to be a politician who can find her true happiness in the happiness of other people. So, I, Takaraishi Miki, as your candidate for office, hereby pledge to honor these promises. And one day, I promise I shall be your Prime Minister! So, at the polls, please cast your vote for Takaraishi Miki of your Blue Harmony Party! You've got my vote, Miss Takaraishi! Granny. You're the best lady! Become the Prime Minister! Yeah, you can do it! Go get 'em! - Go for it! - Good luck! Thank you so much! Thank you so much! Thank you so much! You're the best, sis! Thank you all so much! Thank you so much! Where are you? I know you're there! Kadowaki Toshiya! You're supposed to be my aide, aren't you? What kind of aide doesn't stand by his candidate's side? Is there some other politician besides me that you wanna support? One as beautiful, smart, stylish, and hard-working as me? I want… you to be by my side. And not just as a politician. You want that, too, right? Then, just stand by my side already! What? Am I wrong? Never seen an election quite like this. Who do you think I am? I'm Takaraishi Miki. And now, here are the election results for the Kanagawa districts. First, in the 19th district. Takaraishi Miki of the Blue Harmony Party wins with 74,118 votes. - Hooray! - Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Miki, congratulations. Don't forget our original agreement. You said you'd make me Prime Minister. I'll shake your hand once you make that happen. Okay. To Madam Prime Minister! Miki, congratulations! I'm so happy. Thank you so much. Committee time. So, that was me, Takaraishi Miki, with my story of revenge, which turned out actually to be the story of my rebirth. One more, and we get a free soup. I'll go grab you a taxi. When you have someone who truly cares about you by your side, it seems that anybody can change. Trust me, I know. Improved By Namikage
