JACK: Sink a little deeper. And warrior one. Fantastic. Excellent, Megan. Just a... [CAMERA CLICKS] ...don't forget to breathe. If I forgot to breathe, I'll have more problems than my form. Yes, and your form is perfect. So, let's just add a little oxygen. Sink a little deeper. Warrior two. Nice work, Sally. Just keep it loose. Look out over your middle finger of your front hand. Fantastic. You're adjusting my "perfect form?" Oh, no, I'm just holding your hand while admiring your perfect form. Get comfortable. Warrior three. [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] Great. Still perfect. Well, perfect for someone who's not breathing correctly. And if I do pass out? Well, then I'll have to revive you... ...and your perfect form. [GASPS] Naughty. You know it. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [CAMERA CLICKS] JACK: Bring your hands to the heart center. Great job, everyone. Namaste. ALL: Namaste. Hey, Megan, which blue should we use on the presentation board? She says royal blue. I think it's more of a periwinkle. Periwinkle doesn't scream "Buy this latest piece of technology." More than royal blue does? Okay, look, guys, why don't you mock-up both do an informal office poll and let the best color win. Okay? Cool. Told you. Hey! Hey! Oh, my God! What? Something. Wait. Don't tell me. Okay, either kiss me or get the food from my teeth but this, uh, personal space thing is creepy. Jack proposed. Seriously? How do you know every single thing about me before it comes out of my mouth? BROOKE: I'm your best friend. That's my job. Where's my big surprise moment? Everyone deserves a big surprise moment. Show me! Okay. MEGAN: My left hand already feels heavier. Oh, right! Wow! How does a yogi afford that kind of real estate? Yeah, it was his mom's. It's Bril. Seriously though, if you make it to the altar before me, I will punch you. I just made "Save the Day" magnets. I'm not in a hurry. I'm going to enjoy a long engagement. Good. 'Cause I'm commandeering next March. Anything after that is all yours. The entire month? It's me. Not only am I high maintenance, I'm also seriously challenged at decision making, and I can't do it without you. Fine, diva, I'm yours. [CLICKS TONGUE] Unless I elope to Tahiti for all of March. Ha-ha-ha. Yeah, it's all fun and games until you have to audition DJs and you become some crazy needy baby. Okay, fine, we have almost a year to deal with rotten DJs. And now, I gotta do some type of work thing or it's county courthouse nuptials for me. Fine. More later. Okay. Hey, Megan? Mm-hm. [LAUGHS] We're getting married! Okay, back to work. Work... Okay, fine, fine. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [CAMERA CLICKS] I love you. What? I said I love you, Megan Libby, soon to be Megan Porter. [LAUGHS] You're being ridiculous. I'm in love with the most amazing woman on the face of the earth, right there. There she is. She's all mine. MEGAN: Okay, stop. I love you, too! Bye. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] Can I help you? Did you hear? Hear what? Her fiance died. What? Yeah. Just over the weekend. Wait... Wait, you're kidding me. Nope. Crazy. Wha... Uh, but what happened? Car accident? No, man. Crazy. He was murdered. Oh, my God! How? I mean, where? Well, details keep changing. But some are saying... bad drug deal. What? Yeah. Others are saying, just a robbery gone bad. He was stabbed, like, a lot. LLOYD: Oh, my God! Megan... I mean, how is she? She called out for the week. Which really hoses us for the Lander pitch but... I mean, you know... No, I don't know. I have no earthly idea, actually. [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] [SIGHS] [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] [CAMERA CLICKS] [CAMERA CLICKS] [MUSIC INTENSIFIES] [MEGAN SOBBING] You know, I'm gonna be lost without you. You'll be fine. Don't go. [SIGHS] I just... I can't stay here. BROOKE: I know. God, I'm gonna miss you. I'm gonna miss you too. Oh... Why're you moving so far away? But, hey... ...at least you'll be closer to my wedding. God, I'm such a jerk. I'm sorry... No, it's okay. I am so, so happy for you. It's just... It's still raw. Yeah, I know. Uh, hey. Call me. All the time. I will. [SNIFFLES] Okay. Okay. [CLEARS THROAT] BROOKE: Hey, Lloyd. LLOYD: Uh, hi, Brooke. Uh, Megan. This is for you. That's so sweet of you. Just wanted to let you know that, uh we'll all miss you around here. Thank you. Uh, can I ask you a crazy question? Okay. What are you doing right now? [SIGHS] I'm going home to finish packing. Probably getting something to eat. I leave first thing in the morning. Would you... I mean, can I buy you a drink? Uh, it doesn't mean anything. I just, uh... I know how hard the last couple of months have probably been for you and I wanted to let you know that you'll always have friends back here. I don't know, it... Yeah. No, I, I get it. I just, uh... I thought... Oh, hell, I don't know. Um, I thought it might be nice to out with a toast and a grin, instead of a... MEGAN: You know what? Yeah. I think a, a friendly toast from a friendly face would be just the thing. [CHUCKLES] Okay. Um, just give me two seconds. Sure. MEGAN: And then I moved here. Oh, my God! I'm so sorry. I've been talking about myself the whole time. No! No, it's nice. It's nice to see you smile. You've just been so sad. Great, Lloyd, perfect upbeat tone. God, punch me. MEGAN: No, no, it's fine. Really. It's just... Uh, no one ever prepares you, you know? I mean, we were gonna get married. I loved him. It's just... Grief is so... Confusing. Exactly. When my dad died... ...I didn't know how to behave. One minute, I was angry the next minute, I was inconsolable. There's no guidebook, there's no protocol, no... Warning. Yeah. Look, grief's hard. And you're still so close to it, but... ...and I speak from experience it does get easier. And time really does heal. You just... You gotta be patient. You're really easy to talk to. Thank you. So are you. Thank you. Excuse me. Can I take your picture? Uh... sure. Yeah. Cool. [CAMERA CLICKS] [CAMERA CLICKS] MALE 1: If you want these, they'll be ready in few minutes. Thank you. Okay. Cool. Ugh, I never buy those things. They're way too... Overpriced? Right? Exactly. Yes. Still, I think this time I might make an exception. Thank you. For what? I've had a really good time tonight. How come we've never hung out before? [CHUCKLES] Uh, introverts aren't generally prone to huge bouts of "hanging out." Well, you're doing really well with this small bout. [CHUCKLES] How come you don't have a girlfriend? Psst... I don't think that's gonna happen. And why not? I have no game. Oh, gross. No, I... Let me give you an insider tip, okay? Game may win you a date but never a mate. Really? Yup. Deep intel I'm giving you here. Oh, no... Wha-what is this look? I'm assessing... objectively. You want it? I guess so. Uh, not like I'm killin' it on my own here. Okay, so, here's the thing, Lloyd. You're cute. You're marketable. But you don't own it. Yeah, see? You're... Y-you're a techie. I know it. You live it. Inside and out. And it's actually a thing. A "thing?" Yeah, completely. Intellectual hipster. You just need a nudge in the hipster direction. You think I'm a Wikipedia nerd. But you-you can totally rock it. And... I mean, come here. May I? It's okay. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] There. You're halfway to hipster already. Uh, great. Now, if you can just, uh, be my dresser and personal stylist for the rest of... ...forever? Thank you. No, no. Chivalry is not dead at least for us half-hipsters. No, it's not. I should probably stop wearing this, huh? Hey, hey. It's okay. Like I said, grief has its own timetable. It also has landmines that unexpectedly explode when you're just walkin' around. Ugh. Now and then. I know, right? MALE 1: Would you be interested in purchasing a print? Uh, no, that's okay... Oh, we'll take two. A send-off memento. Thank you. You're welcome. Alright. Mama's gonna love this. [MEGAN CHUCKLING] LLOYD: Love it. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] BESSIE: Good mornin', baby boy. How are you today? Lloyd. Honey. Breakfast. Mama... Honey, come on. Oh, well, who's the pretty girl? My girlfriend. Oh... [BOTH LAUGHING] You... Ooh, exciting! Look at her. I hope she's like you. She's a lucky girl, isn't she? Oh, I'm so glad, honey. I'm so happy for you. [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] [UPBEAT MUSIC] [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] [SIGHS] Hey. Come on, sis. Time to hit the town. Kate. No, I get to decide what we're doing tonight and it's not staying home to watch the "Great British Bake-Off." Fine. But only if you come for a run with me first. Ah, I hate running, but if that's what it takes to get you come out, fine. You're a tyrant. Yeah, I am. But you love me. I do. Oh, we're doing this? Come on. Yeah. We're doing it right now, come on. Fine. Running. Yay! [KATE AND MEGAN PANTING] KATE: You said we could stop at three miles. You are a horrible, horrible person. [LAUGHING] Come on, you're killing your old record. My old record was jogging with difficulty to catch the bus... ...a patient... ...or the fridge during a commercial break. Refer back to horrible person, please. [IMITATING BABY CRY] LLOYD: Megan? Lloyd? [LAUGHS] What are you doing here? I just moved here. MEGAN: Uh, that's amazing! Ha-ha. What a small world. Right? Yeah. A job opportunity came up, and, I thought w-why not? Time for a change of scenery. So, here I am. [LAUGHS] Uh, this is crazy. I... So, I... You look great. Oh, thank you. Uh, I got some fashion advice from a friend. Um, hello, standing right here... Oh, sorry. Lloyd, this is my sister, Kate. Kate, this is my ex-colleague? Yeah... No, that sounds weird. Uh, this is my friend, Lloyd. Well, Lloyd, Megan's friend want to personally thank you for saving me from a pending cardiac arrest. No problem. I personally only run when I am being chased. See? Thank you. A normal human. Thank you, Lloyd. You got it. Couch potatoes unite. Uh, so, uh, where are you working now? Uh, mostly over at, uh, Bosch Associated. Nice. Uh, they're doing really well since their expansion into wearables. I know, right? And blah, blah, blah. Techie, tech, tech... Nerds. Okay. You're gonna have to forgive my sister. She gets a little cranky when she sweats. She also still owns a VCR. Shut up. I'm retro. And I'm also about to eat my own foot. Megs, please. Okay. We're gonna find a way to get her home and fed but we should... We should get together sometime. Really? That... Yeah, that would be great. Uh, I haven't really met anybody out here, yet. Yeah. Um... Here. Plug in your number. When I get the chance, I'll show you around. I would love that. Okay. Uh, yeah, I'll let you two get back to workin' out. Uh, very nice to meet you, Kate, my fellow couch potato. I'll see you around, Megan. See you around. Let's go. No, I'm still walking. MEGAN: Come on. Come on. Go, go. You can do this. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [BIRDS CHIRPING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] WOMAN: [ON TV] I guess so. Anyway, his size... [TELEPHONE RINGING] Yes, sir, got a good look. MAN: [ON TV] You can know him if you saw him again. LLOYD: [ON PHONE] Mama, it's soon. I can feel it. BESSIE: Really? I can't wait for you to meet her. [CHUCKLES] Mm. Well, she's no longer wearing her old ring. Oh! You think she's finally ready? Yes, mama. [SIGHS] It's time. To accept your true love. Yes. I told you. LLOYD: You did. You were right, mama. She is everything. ♪ With your pretty hair ♪ ♪ Got me looking over there at you ♪ ♪ 'Cause I can't get enough of you... ♪ KATE: There're a lot of cute guys here. You need to trust me. Okay? Okay. Okay. We're... Oh, hey. Him. No. Shifty eyes. What? Wh... It's a thing. Aah! Okay. Him? Uh, no. Too many curls. You are unbelievable. You are... Wow. Okay. Him. Whoa. Wow. I will be back. Be back from where? Stay right there. Uh, no. No, Kate. Hi. Hi. How are you? Great. If you're not hiding any crazy psychological issues can, uh, my sister buy you a drink? Uh, I'm not. And she definitely can. Good answer. Yeah. Okay. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Hi. Hi, hi. [LAUGHING] So what are you drinking? It's on me. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Got a minute? It's a big day. I might even have three. Perfect. You know we have the McFeely meeting coming up. I want you to take the lead. Seriously? [CHUCKLES] I mean, thank you. Yes. It'll mean long hours. I can do those. Excellent. I gotta say, you are a creative rockstar. [CHUCKLES] Can't tell you how lucky I am you transferred in here. Oh, sure you could. But that would cut into my three minutes. You know what... ...why don't you take a rest of the afternoon off? It's gonna be nose to grindstone for the next two weeks. I think you don't have to tell me twice. See you tomorrow, then. First thing. Absolutely. [GIGGLES] [CELLPHONE BEEPING] Hey, what's up? [SIGHS] Mr. Goldstein's blood pressure. If you weren't so mean, you would be pretty. The way you talk. Keep wheeling, charmer. Ahh. Wait, why are you calling me? You never call me from prison. I got the afternoon off. For good behavior? Yeah, something like that. Any chance you can play hooky with me today? Oh, I wish. I'm assisting on an 88-year-old's gallstone operation later. You're so jealous of me right now. So jealous. Who's jealous? Oh, all my suitors, Mr. Goldstein. I told them you had won my head and heart. Okay, are we actually moving, or we're just rocking back and forth? GOLDSTEIN: [ON PHONE] I'm telling you the second you shut that yapper, you're a stunner. Oh, you love me. Nah... How come you didn't call Chris? Uh, he's at a work convention. Oh. Okay. Well, have fun painting the town. Think of me. Elbows deep in gallbladder junk. [CHUCKLES] What are you laughing at? You. Ugh. [BEEPS] [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] [CELLPHONE BUZZING] Hey, Lloyd. It's Megan. Hello. Look, I'm getting off early today. Do you, maybe, wanna, I don't know check out the park, or get some Chinese? LLOYD: [ON PHONE] Definitely. I'll meet you at the ducks. MEGAN: So, I hear they have the best chicken lo mein in town. I've been dying to try it but no one would go with me. Kate's always working, so... I'll go with you. I know, I know exactly what you're talking about. Yes, I mean... It's just around the corner. Oh, it's right over there. [CHUCKLES] I love Chinese. I am so happy you like Chinese food. To my perfect hooky buddy. Cheers. [CHUCKLING] Oh! I really needed this. Ooh! Wow. Work has sucked so bad lately. Aah! I'm so glad I could be of assistance. Do you miss the old job? Sometimes. There was a lot more freedom there but not as much room for advancement. Yeah. Here, all advance but my boss is kind of a jerk. You should just kill him. I should just kill him. [LAUGHING] Tell you, this is definitely the most fun I've had since I've been here. Oh, this is definitely the most fun I've had since you've been here. [CHUCKLES] Oh, my God. I think I'm drunk. Thank God, I live only two blocks away. Where do you live? Two blocks away. Thank you. What, seriously? No. Three blocks away. Oh. Thank you. A-da-da. Chivalry is not dead. Megan. Come on, it's my pleasure. It is nice to have someone to hang out with today. Alright. Ahem. Eh, don't. Why? What... Fortunes only come true if you have someone hand it to you. Yeah, okay. What? You're superstitious. And what is that, weird? No, it's adorable, actually. Oh. Oh. One second. Hi, baby. Uh, yeah. I'm actually out with my friend Lloyd. Can I give you a call back in about ten minutes? Okay. Welcome home. Bye. Another friend? Boyfriend, actually. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] I, I thought you were still grieving. I am, but it's... I don't know, it's been a year and I'm ready to date again. And Chris is pretty fantastic. That's great. Yeah. I think you're gonna love him. You know what? We should all hang out sometime. That would be great. Can't wait. I brought you Chinese. And don't say I never think about you. Leftover or my own? I was thinking about you when I asked them to pack up my leftovers. Did Chris have fun at his lawyer thing? Convention? Yeah. I don't know. I have to call him. Who'd you ended up going out with? Lloyd. My colleague from my old job, remember? You just met him on the street. Couch potato crew. Oh. Right. Oh. Hm. And he seems kinda lonely. Hm. Yeah. And he was talking about how he hasn't met a lot of people. Hm. And I, uh... And I notice how you haven't exactly been very social, so... Seriously, Megs? Like, I have time to date? I'll have you know, I was proposed to twice today. Really should have gone into ortho instead of geriatrics. I'm just saying, maybe you guys could hang out sometime. He doesn't know anyone else in town. Meg... I'll do your laundry for a week. Oh, you know how I feel about laundry. Yeah. Fine, make it a month and we have a deal. Okay, fine. Yes! Oh! [MEGAN LAUGHING] And that is when she flipped over her kayak. I... And I knew the second I was trapped that this was not going to end well. Look, I'm not the best swimmer but let's just say that I got there first. He saved my life. Yeah. In four feet of water. No. I think my pool is deeper. I don't know. It seemed about six feet to me. That is the cutest story I never wanna hear again, you guys. Oh, come on, Kate. Well, what about, uh, what about you? I thought it was a fine story. Little long, but... Ah! [LAUGHING] What? No. I meant, how are you adjusting. TCH. Fine. Oh, Lloyd is just being very modest. He already has a job, a place and a knowledge of at least two top dinning spots. Mm, wait, Lloyd, you mean to tell me that you didn't just move in with your sister for three months and then never move out? People do that? You shut up. You love me living with you. I love you paying half my rent. Uh, no, two-thirds your rent. Well, you have a better job. It makes more sense. Okay, so, Lloyd, um Megan tells me that, uh, that you're a tech guy. I'm a programmer. Oh, so can you fix computers? Not the hard drive but if you have software issues I'm fairly handy. Then, I may be calling upon your talents because my computer just hates me. No, it doesn't hate you. It's just tragically out of date. Apparently, Chris was the only one in law school who refused to use a laptop. Oh, well, I think I did okay with my pen and my notebook. Oh, you mean you didn't have your quill and ink handy? Oh, you loved my little quill, little... ...little feathered quill... Ew! Okay, you guys, save it for the wedding. Whose wedding? Oh, Brooke, she's getting married at a winery up the coast. Right. Yes. Brooke. Yeah, and it couldn't come at a better time too. Pete just found a way to double my workload. He's such a jerk. Yeah, Captain of the jerks. He really is, totally monopolized your time since you started working there. I barely saw her this week. Yeah, and you're not going to. We're heading into a new project, and I'm on point. I'm about to drop off the grid. So, this, you guys you are my last taste of joy and freedom. Thank you. Cheers. I'm so proud of you. That's... Thank you. Congrats, baby. [TELEPHONE RINGING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER ON TV] Oh! Hello. Hey, mama. Hi, baby. I miss you. [CHUCKLES] I miss you more. How's the job search? Yeah, it's going okay. And your girlfriend? Good. Really good. We had a fancy dinner tonight. Oh. Well, take your time, baby. Women like romance. Don't tell her you love her. Show her you love her. Remember, baby, love is an... An action. Yes, mama. I know. FEMALE 1: Megan's desk is straight down the hallway to the right. LLOYD: Great. Thank you. Hey, stranger. Lloyd? You forgot. Oh, shoot. No. Uh, yes. I mean, yeah, I did. It's just been really crazy here today. No worries. It was just lunch. The poppers at Gino's are all-you-can-eat though. I'm an idiot. I'm so sorry, I can't. I promise I'll make it up to you. My boss is being such a tool. I've had to redo this spreadsheet three times and the presentation is next week. Hm. Really, don't, don't worry. We'll rain check. Okay. Hey, Megan. Ah. Didn't realize you had time for friends. Thought you'd be... I am. I'm on it. Good. I'll leave you to it then. I'm headed to lunch. I expect your revisions when I get back. [MEGAN SCOFFS] [SIGHS] Uh... Okay, then. Call me when you're free. Yeah, I will. [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] [MEGAN LAUGHING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Oh. Oh, look. I'm all sweaty. You'll know when you kiss me. MEGAN: God, I needed this. I want this moment to last forever. I do not wanna go back to work. No. No, no, no. No work talk. You promised me. Two more days. Just two more days. That's literally all I can think about. Really? 'Cause I'm thinking it's seven more days. Why? It's our weekend. Yes. Seven more days. God, I love you. Oh, my God. Is that weird? Did I... Did I just make that weird? I... It just flew out and I wasn't thinking but... [LAUGHING] I don't wanna take it back or... I love you, too. [CHUCKLES] [SHUTTER CLICKS] I like you. [CHUCKLES] Ultimately, we believe our product will not only increase consumer sales, it will give you an entry into the industrial market as well. The market that has previously been unattainable because of the foreign underpricing which you will now undercut. It's the right move at the right time. FEMALE 2: That was such a great presentation. It's perfect. It's exactly what we've been talking about. PETE: Oh, my God! That was amazing. You were amazing. Thank you. I, I feel great. You know what this means. A promotion? Too soon. It means a long, long relationship with this company. This is phenomenal! Celebration cocktail? Uh, no. Actually, I, I have to get home. You know, we really should have drinks sometime. We can discuss your advancement potential. Sure thing. You know, we could also do that at the office. Anytime over lunch. At the office. Need a lift? Uh, no, thank you. I have my car. Megan? Yeah. Really great job. As soon as I get back from Seattle, let's talk. [INTENSE MUSIC] [GROANING] [HONKING] It's just a virus. No big deal. Should be pretty easy to wipe. Seriously? How lucky am I that Megan's new friend is techie? So lucky. So, I hyper-sensitized the drive in case something like this happens again. There's an alert that'll show up. You'll be able to stop it from doing any more damage. You're a good man. I know. [EXHALES] Thank you. No problem. That's what I do. Well, it's impressive. [MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO] Kate, how many black t-shirts do you actually need for one weekend? Seven. Other than your hideous bridesmaid's dress. Hideous. Unflattering to every shape and size. Were you aware of how much Brooke really hates you? You really only need pajamas. Then again, you might not even need those. Wink. Okay, two t-shirts, need those shorts. Wedding stuff and pajamas. I'm a nurse. I know. Trust me, Chris probably hasn't even started packing yet. This is mine. Please. Fine. Thank you. Didn't even ask. I don't have to. [KEYS CLACKING] I wish I had your, um... ...comfortability with technology. Well, uh, it's just a matter of jumping in. Not letting fear stop you from getting what you want. Right. Yeah, I don't seem to have that problem with any other aspect of my life, uh, just computers. You want me to climb the mountain or charm a client I'm your guy, but, uh, technology, man. [SCOFFS] Well, not everything can just be so easily handed to everyone. Well, I-I wasn't saying, uh... That's not, that's not what I meant. Um, you know what, I wasn't saying any... That was, like, easy... You know what? Um... I gotta go. Wait, what? Whoa, hey. Wait, h-hold on a sec, did... Did I offend you in some... No. You didn't. Really, it's okay. I just... Never mind. I have to go. Okay... Okay, I got some roofing stuff to do anyway. Um, hey, thank you. Got it. See ya. Yep. ♪ She was sexy like it's nothing ♪ [KNOCK ON DOOR] Wine? Is it six o'clock? In Paraguay. Thank you. Mm-hm. So, in today's news, I told Chris that I loved him. Do you? Of course. That's a weird question. Well, I'm a weird person. Oh, I'm so happy for you. Wow, I've not been in love in forever. You will, you will find love. You are so smart and gorgeous. Mm, it's a curse. What about Lloyd? Seriously? No. Why not? He is not my type. I thought your type was, upright bi-ped? Yeah, it is, and other particulars, like, humor. A job. Lloyd has a job. Yeah, but no. I think you guys would make a... Okay, Megan, stop. I, I'm a grown woman. I can choose my own suitors. "Suitors?" Seriously? Are you going to entertain them on a veranda with a mint julep? You forgot my bustle and fancy hand fan. [CHUCKLES] Speaking of which... How was a fan a good segue to laundry? Because I'm a fan of you doing my laundry. Ooh, see what I did there? No, I don't. I'm working up to it. You've had three days off of work. How have you not had time to do laundry? I was decompressing. This was a big deal that we closed. How is Mr. Personality? Pete? Mm-hm. Ugh, I've no idea. Uh, he's headed to Seattle to dot the I's and cross the T's. And when the cat's away... The mouse... Do her sister's damn laundry. Ew! Gross. It's not that... Ew! Uh, it's gross. That's gross. Sorry. [RATTLING] [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] [INTENSE MUSIC] [THUDS] [GRUNTS] MEGAN: It was always my favorite place as a kid. KATE: Mm, me too. All those rooms. I used to pretend like we lived in some remote place in England. Like "Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe." But every time I opened up those closets there were just itchy, old coats. No talking lions or evil witches. Someday, I'm gonna buy a Victorian like grandma did. Fix it up. Give my kids a place to explore and imagine. KATE: And your spinster sister Kate. Don't forget about me. Okay, you can have your own wing. [CELLPHONE BUZZING] Hm. I don't know this number. No, that's the hospital. Pick that up. Hello? Oh, my God! Hi. What happened? I fell. Fell. It's a... it's a funny, funny, funny word. Okay, what is happening? He's on a morphine drip. Apparently, he had an accident with a ladder and... the ladder won. Oh, my God, baby. I am so sorry. Gosh! Is-is there anything I could do? Yeah. Yeah. Um... [CHUCKLES] You know that, you know that movie we watched with the... ...with the chair in the water and the Sp-splash? Yeah. Dancing... Do you wanna do... You wanna dance, Megsy? Mm-hm. Yeah. Okay, on second thought, maybe we, uh repack those granny PJs... ...Megsy. [SIGHS] So pretty. Thank you. Wow! MEGAN: Maybe she'll understand. KATE: She absolutely will not understand. This is Brooke we're talking about. She wouldn't talk to you for a month after you missed her birthday. And it was her 26th. That's not even a special birthday. And it was at a bar. Her wedding, no, you're going or you're done. Please, please, please, come with me. I would but I can't, I'm covering a double on Saturday, and this double's covering the-the... I just can't because I suck, but I'll look in on Chris for you, and I'll only borrow half your clothes. Ugh, I hate going to weddings alone. They're so depressing. And, oh, my God, the bouquet toss. Are you kidding me? I need someone there to help me make fun of those people. I cannot be one of those people. I can break my leg. I'll break my leg. Oh, no, no. I got it. What, you can go? No. But you can take your new bestie. Lloyd? Yeah. Why not? I mean, it's obvious that guy's so lonely. I mean, weekend getaway? Come on. Your bait is here. That doesn't seem weird? Asking him to a wedding. A weekend getaway. No, I think it'll work out perfectly. I mean, you like being with him, and... Maybe he'll hook up with someone at the wedding, you know. Weddings are filled with desperate people. I mean, maybe he'll get lucky and then you can leave me alone with my geriatric patients and cat-filled future. Which is actually a lot more fun than it sounds. MEGAN: Kate, where are you? Captain Slavedriver is still AWOL so I don't know if I even need to go in to work today. Call me back. [DOORBELL RINGING] Hey, you. Hey. Hope I'm not interrupting anything. No, I'm actually just about to go visit Chris at the hospital. Why? What happened? He fell off his ladder yesterday and broke his arm and his leg. Oh, I am so sorry. That's horrible, I... Is there anything I can do? Actually, come to think of it... How do you feel about weddings? [TELEPHONE RINGS] Hi, baby. Hi, mama. BESSIE: [ON PHONE] How's it going with Megan? It's finally happening. We're going away together this weekend. This is it. I just know it. Grand gestures, baby. Something she'll never forget. LLOYD: [ON PHONE] Okay, mama. I think I have a plan. Okay, I will look in on Chris every day but I cannot promise I won't post his goofy morphine babble to all social media everywhere. Thank you. If for looking in, not for the exploitation. Oh, um, but if he's doing funny accents, definitely post. Yeah. Thanks. Are you sure it's okay that I'm doing this? I feel like such an ass. I feel like I should be here. What? It's fine. There's nothing to do here. Except work too hard. Watch your goofy boyfriend battle pudding and lose your best friend. So, go, have fun. Relax. Okay. You're right. You okay? Yeah, sure. Fine. Just, um... be careful. Okay? There's a lot of crazy dancers at the wedding you could take an elbow to that pretty face. Only if it's my own. Okay. Bye. Call me, text me every day. I will. I have no life. I know. I know that. Hello. Hey. Thank you. I'm so excited. Seems so fun. Me too. Here, let me get this for you. Oh, thank you. That's very kind. ♪ So sooner or later ♪ I am completely tone-deaf. Completely, but points for enthusiasm. You, on the other hand, Mr. Murrow have perfect pitch. Ah. Well, I-I was in glee club. Ah. Of course you were. Your parents were hell-bent on securing your virginity, weren't they? I am so sorry. I was joking. No, it's okay. Uh, m-my mother put me in computer club to make smart friends and glee club so I could sing to her at night. It's actually kinda sweet. What about your dad? You mentioned he, he passed away. You remembered. Of course. "There's no protocol for grief." Wise words from a wise man. Thank you. If I'm prying, you can, you can tell me to shut up. No, it's... It's okay. My dad had an accident when I was ten. What kind of accident? If you don't mind me asking. Again, I really don't want to pry. It's alright, really. You're curious. It's nice. I found him, he fell down a flight of stairs. Broke his neck. It was awful. My God! And you were ten? That must've been terrible for you. Just been me and mother ever since. She's definitely been both a mother and a father to me. That's great. I would love to meet her one day. You would? Sure. MEGAN: Don't you just love the smell of the ocean? That must mean we're close. Oh, look, we are. There's the hotel. We're here. Yay! [GASPS] MEGAN: Hi. Hi. Oh. Oh. Oh, you look amazing. Right? I've been on a liquid diet for three weeks to fit into my dress. Is this the famous Chris? Hi. Uh, no, this is actually... Wait, I know you. You're the techie. Lloyd Murrow. Uh, we used to work together. Right. Right. Hi. Yes. Why are you here? Where's Chris? Oh, it's a long story. Long story. Jinx. You owe me a coke. [CHUCKLING] Oh, wait, Chris broke his leg and Lloyd has been my knight in shining armor so I don't have to socialize with your family solo. Well, then, thank you, Lloyd for making sure my bestie got here. 'Cause I'd have absolutely killed her if she didn't. That's what friends are for. [LAUGHING] Let's go! I'll get... Oh... Okay. Oh. Are you kidding me? BROOKE: There's no way we're doing this dinner sober. You do realize my mother is going to be there, right? Well, bottoms up. So... Lloyd? No. Ratchet it back. "Jinx. You owe me a coke." [LAUGHS MOCKINGLY] What is that? Super flirty. Okay, yeah, if you're in the fourth grade. Even defensive. Delusional. So, Lloyd... Wait, which one is Lloyd? Nerdy techie. Oh, he's super cute. And super single. Oh. He's only a friend and he's the only reason I got here. In fact, if you're into intellectual man I would... And look his way. Oh, I'm all for it. At least for tonight, anyway. Look, yes, please. He needs all the help he can get. Okay, then, here is to Lloyd getting laid. Mm-hm. Yes. I except the very best out of you ladies. Please, do it for us. The engaged. The shackled. The done. [GASPS] Here is to being done. Being done. [ALL LAUGHING] Ohh... Mm. Oh, we gotta go. Come on. Downstairs. BROOKE: I'm changing my dress. We gotta go. Let's go. Let's go. BROOKE: Oh, I'm so excited. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [MEGAN AND LLOYD LAUGHING] Ca... Can you believe her mother-in-law? I mean... W-wait, so... Wait, you don't like being asked your age and marital status four times over the first court? Ugh, it was really, really embarrassing. Oh, thank God she moved on to... Xander the third. [LAUGHING] She's marrying a third. That is just so sad. Right? Well, thank God for his deplorable past as an English major. He makes your decrepit age a non-issue. Oh, God, you're great. Thank you. No, I'm serious. I don't have a lot of friends that... Well, I don't have any friends. What I'm saying is I don't have a lot of friends that I can talk to. You're really, really easy to talk to. [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] Megan, I... Oh, my gosh. Do you smell that? The jasmine. Oh. Yeah. It reminds me of when we used to spend summers at my grandma's. Kate and I were just talking about how special my grandma's house was. Really? Tell me about it. Okay. It was, it was a Victorian house with high ceilings and slanted roofs. Ah! It was so magical. It was then that I knew that, that's, that's the house that I ultimately raise my family in. I have one. What? A Victorian. It's not as big but it's got the same bones. The Victorian. Yes, slanted roof and everything. It's great. Shut up. You shut up. Mm. Well, I should get some rest for tomorrow. I gotta make sure I soak my dentures for the big day. If you want I can just marry you so Mama Manners will stand down. What? Nothing. Ugh, come on, grandma, let's get you home before your hip gives out. Oh, okay. JENNA: I met Xander when he came to my party and started a conga line, and that's when I knew Brooke was way too good for Xander. But seriously, anyone who sees the way he dances can't possibly want to re-live that. To Brooke and Xander... ...may their marriage last at least twice as long as their engagement. And may they dance on together with their tragic absence of rhythm for many days and nights. [GLASSES CLINK] [APPLAUDING] [GLASS CLINKING] I'd like to toast the bride and groom. Lloyd, really, what are you doing? But mostly I'd just like to toast love. Brooke and Xander have found it. Many of us are still looking for it. An elusive emotion that so many are not fortunate to ever experience. But today, we all get to bear witness to love as it should be. Pure, honest, heartfelt. Four years ago, when I started working at Reynard Global Tech. I met Megan Libby. She was, uh, a creative director I was just a tech nerd, but she was always so kind and smart, and funny. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Yeah, she-she's the kind of girl who'd talk to anybody no matter how low you were on the food chain. It's important to start relationships off as friends and Megan and I were friends first. Oh, he's so romantic. LLOYD: But recently, I've felt more than a friendship for Megan. This place, Brooke and Xander's love. Uh, it's just made it overwhelmingly clear to me that I wanna get to know this woman better. To be more than friends. So, uh, in addition to toasting the bride and groom on everlasting happiness please toast Megan Libby. With whom I intend to explore the possibilities. [GLASSES CLINK] [APPLAUDING] Excuse me. LLOYD: Megan? Megan? Megan, you're being ridiculous. Yeah. Are you kidding me? You just humiliated me in front of my best friend. Not to mention, hijacked my best friend's wedding. I was just sharing my feelings. Again, hijacked. This is Brooke's wedding and you made it about your feelings? Ugh! Utterly mortifying, not to mention... ...selfish a-and awkward. I mean, you toasted about your feelings that I had no idea about. Lloyd, I don't feel that way about you. How do you know? Ugh. No. I love Chris. I don't love you, Lloyd. Look, you've been a great friend, but this... Uh-uh. This is wrong on every level. I've never had those kind of feelings for you. Never. And look, I apologize if I... ...somehow misconstrued our friendship. But, Lloyd, I only like you as a friend. Maybe you, maybe you just need time. Maybe you have feelings for me that you haven't accepted yet. No. I don't. [SCOFFS] Uh, I changed my look for you. What? My hair and my clothes. Ugh! That's insane. I told my mother about you. Why? I love you. Stop. Lloyd. I don't know how to say this other than very slowly so that you hear me and understand. I don't have those kind of feelings for you. Not repressed, not undiscovered not subconsciously... not at all. AUTOMATED VOICE: Your ride has arrived. At least let me drive you home, Megan. I think that'd be a really bad idea. We both need some time apart, okay? And I need you to hear me and understand. [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] [TELEPHONE RINGING] Hi, baby. Hey, mama. How'd you know it was me? [CHUCKLES] It's always you, baby. How was the wedding? Good. You're lying. I don't think she feels the same way about me as I feel about her. Of course she does. You moved all the way out there for her. Away from your mother. I do, I do believe she does love me. She just needs... time to realize it. God, I missed you. I can't believe that Lloyd turned out to be such a psycho. I mean, it doesn't exactly help that I'm all hovelled up right now but I'd like to speak with him, real hard. Easy, caveman, he's harmless. Just confused. I think delusional is more like it. He's harmless. Harmless is like a kitten in a pet store or something. Not some love-crazed nutjob. BESSIE: [ON PHONE] You know what you need to do. Grand gestures, baby. I'm trying, mama. No one can resist my baby. You show her what love can be. I will, mama. I will. I will. I'm gonna call him. Don't. Really. I just wanna put this behind me, okay? Look, can you kiss me? Or is your testosterone level too strong? Fine, but you're gonna have to meet me halfway here because I'm not exactly mobile, and Nurse Bossy McGee over there told me I gotta take it easy. Fine, fine. Mama, mama, I'm just... ...feeling down. Should I sing to you, baby? Sure, mama. ♪ Baby won't you please come home? ♪ ♪ 'Cause your mama's all alone ♪ ♪ When you left you broke my heart ♪ ♪ 'Cause you said we'll never part ♪ ♪ Baby won't you please come home? ♪ You always make me feel better. Thank you, mommy. [SIGHS] Did somebody just call my name? Oh, you're a tyrant. Heh. Here you go. Hey, maybe you should have a talk with Nerdy McPsycho. Oh, my God, can we just stop talking about him. And can you McStop it with the names? "But I changed my look for you. I told my mother about you." You're my soulmate. Buffering, buffering, buffering. Stop, he's just confused. Confused. Yeah, well... I am not confused. Come here, woman. Kiss me. McHottie. Hmm, you know it. You ready? Mm-hmm. Ready for what? You'll see. Ah. MEGAN: What's happening? [CHRIS CLEARS THROAT] I would get down on one knee but it'd be really awkward if you had to pick me up. Plus, this gets me the sympathy vote. This isn't happening. Oh, it's happening. Megan Libby, I know that we've only known each other for a few months, but... Yes. I'm not finished yet. Yes. Yes, I will marry you. All day, every day, forever and ever you silly gimp. Ha-ha! I love you, and I wanna spend forever with you so you take as much time as you need. [LAUGHING] I rehearsed this speech since the second week we were together, so I had to get it done. What was wrong with the first week? CHRIS: Oh, shut up. Come here. I love you. Love you. [SIGHS] [INTENSE MUSIC] [INTENSE MUSIC] Did you hear? Ah, I've been doing contracts since I got in this morning and I haven't even had coffee, so, no. Hear what? Megan... What is up? Pete is dead. They found his body in the river. Who dumps bodies in the river? I mean, he was definitely sleazy and he was a complete jerk, but he didn't deserve that. [SIGHS] Do the cops know anything? Just that he's been dead for a week. Oh, my God. I think I'm-I'm probably one of the last people to see him. He never went to Seattle. Did that make you a suspect? Oh. Are you kidding me? Okay, I probably watch way too much "CSI." Okay. But they do always interview the last person to see the deceased. And the weird, innocuous side character. Oh, my God, I could be both. I-I probably am both. But you have an alibi. Right and no motive. Well, actually... What? With Pete gone, what does that mean for work? I-I don't know, he didn't really have much to do with the deal, so, I... I guess it relies on me now. Oh! Okay, okay, this is way too dark. Let's talk about something else. Like the gorgeous earrings you got me. Oh, my God. Kate... Well... What? How do you know what I'm getting for you? I stalk your Amazon. You serious? I'm just being honest, and while we're at it sometimes I check where you are when you're late. It's a sister thing. I worry about you. You should be grateful. Oh... Okay. How do you, how do you check where I am, you stalker? Uh, Find My Phone. We're both registered here on the desktop. And I know your password. Okay, that is a complete invasion of privacy. You know what, you, you and I we're gonna have a little conversation about boundaries very soon but I can only handle one insane thing at a time. So, I'm just gonna forget that you've been cyber-stalking me and go back to my boss. Past. Past boss. Oh, my God. Poor Pete. Poor Pete. LLOYD: Mama, so I've been thinking about what you said and I have the perfect grand gesture plan. [CELL PHONE BEEPS] Hold on, hold on. Speak of the angel. Mama, I'll call you back. Okay? Yeah, bye. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [YELLS] MEGAN: Okay, sure. Well, I'm... I'm looking now, but I can't find anything they sent from April. You know what? Why don't you double-check and give me a call back in a few minutes, okay? Alright. Bye. [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] ♪ Can't get close enough ♪ ♪ To you you you ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ ♪ It is a beautiful heart ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ ♪ See the light in the dark ♪ [CELL PHONE BUZZING] [SIGHS] Hi, Lloyd. I am so sorry. I was an idiot. Yes, yes, you were, but that was impressive. I just... I-I honestly don't know what came over me. I... I think being at the wedding brought up feelings about my dad's death. I went crazy. I just... I felt completely blindsided. I know, I'm so sorry. What I'm most upset about is our friendship. I, I really miss hanging out with you. Me too. Let me make it up to you. Uh, my mother just sent me the most amazing steaks from back home. Let me make you dinner. Look, I don't think... You know, if-if it makes you more comfortable I'm seeing someone. A girl from work. Really? Yeah, she's amazing. I think you'd really like her. That's, that's great, Lloyd. Really. Megan, I just really wanna apologize properly. You're only my real friend in the city and I'd love to share my happiness with you. And spend the rest of my days making it up to you for a random psychotic break. [CHUCKLES] Oh, Lloyd. And, of course, invite Chris too. Uh, I'll invite my girl, it'll be... God, Megan, I just, I really wanna earn back your trust and friendship. Well, Chris is busy tonight, but I do love a good steak. As much as you want. I, on the other hand, will be eating nothing but crow. [CHUCKLES] Okay, well, in that case, you're on. Great. Uh, 7:00? Sounds good. Text me the address. I'll see you then. I'll see you tonight. [LAUGHING] [KNOCK ON DOOR] Come in. It's open. Hey, Chris. Lloyd. Wow. Uh, I, I didn't... I didn't expect to see you. Um, how-how are you? Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. I just, uh... I needed to talk to you. Are you busy? Uh... Well, the good thing about being on disability leave is when you work from home, nobody knows you're taking a break. Come in. I'd get up, but I'm, uh... ...not exactly 100 percent here. Do you want a beer? No, I'm good. Thanks. I feel so stupid. [CHUCKLES] I get it. Megan can have that effect on people. No, you don't seem to get it. I love her. Oh... Listen, Lloyd... No, no, no. No, Chris. You listen. She loves me too. Lloyd... Yeah. Megan and I have a connection, Chris. Okay? We have since the day we met. I said I felt stupid because it took me so long to act on it. What we have is special, unique. Her time with you is simply a diversion. What we have is so powerful, it scares her. Lloyd... I think you should go. Cool bat. You play? Take a swing. Ah... I know this must be hard to digest. It's heartbreaking realizing that you've been a pawn. But it's time for you to go, not me. She simply needs the obstacles removed before she can accept her faith. Which is she and I, together. She knows this in her heart, but you keep muddying things. Lloyd... Sometimes... ...something so true and powerful can be scary. What we have is just that. It's undeniable. I am simply clearing a path for her to see and accept that. And you, Chris... ...you are in my path. Lloyd... Aah! She doesn't love you! LLOYD: She doesn't love you! She doesn't love you! [INTENSE MUSIC] [CROWS CAWING] I honestly feel like this is a turning point in our relationship, mama. I haven't felt this good in days. Yeah, I think she's happy that I'm back in her life. Absence makes the heart grow fonder, baby. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] LLOYD: It's open. Come on in. [DOOR CLOSES] Hello. LLOYD: I'm in the kitchen. Come on back. [CHUCKLES] Okay. [SIGHS] Wow, this place is stunning. Stunning. Jinx! You owe me a coke. Too soon. Yeah. Hey. I've missed you. I've missed you, too. I'm sorry, I was such a psycho. Let's just blame it on the wedding. Weddings tend to make even the sanest of us lose our minds. I mean, the music alone... Still, I feel horrible. Mortified and horrible. It's fine. Really, let's just get past the weird phase and go straight into the acceptance and forgiveness phase. Please. Okay. Okay, come on. Where is your girlfriend? I was, uh, hoping to meet her. Oh, wow. Um... Well, you said Chris couldn't come so I told her another time. Wow, this is weird. I'm so sorry. Let me call her, I'm sure she can be here in 20 minutes. Oh, don't be silly, Lloyd. Really? The last thing I wanna do is make you feel uncomfortable. It's fine. Really. It also smells fantastic. Thank you. Can I open up the wine? Yes, please. Fancy. I know. LLOYD: So I guess when I said I had a Victorian that was only partially true. As in, I don't have, I rent. It's really lovely. Slanted roof and all. Thank you. So, do I get the official tour? Of course. This is the kitchen. Wow, you're an excellent tour guide. Heh-heh. Well, my Yelp reviews are exceptional. Follow me. The tour continues this way. Okay. [CELL PHONE BUZZING] LLOYD: Yes. Most of the furniture belongs to my mother. She shifted here for me. Oh, that's sweet of her. I'd be lost without her. She plans to move out here once I'm settled. I bet the steaks are almost ready. Can I fill up your wine? Yes, please. Oh, hey, does the tour include directions to the bathroom because, TCH, wine. Right down the hall, to your right. Okay. I'll be back. I'll be here. Hey, Chris, it's me, um... I, I can't get a hold of Megan and she said she was having dinner with, uh, Lloyd. Is she crazy? I know I'm just being a paranoid sister and you can just tell me that, but... Will you just call me back? Okay? I don't wanna bother you, I just keep getting your voice mail, so... Call me when you can. Bye. Thank you. Okay. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] Megan. Aah! I wasn't ready to show this to you, Megan. This? What is this? It's an homage to you. I worked very hard on it. I hope you appreciate it. Although, now you've ruined the surprise. Remember when I told you that I wanted you to meet my girlfriend? See? It wasn't a fib. Mm... Hello, girlfriend. You didn't answer me, Megan. Ah, what-what-what? [CLEARS THROAT] Do you like it? Lloyd, why are you doing this? I got this for you. For us. You said you wanted a Victorian. I got you a Victorian. Jack didn't. Chris didn't. I did. Mama said grand gestures. This is a grand gesture. The steaks are ready. I hope you are hungry. Please, do me a favor. Stop ruining my surprises, they've been carefully and meticulously planned. Okay, seriously, Megan. Pick up the damn phone. Where are you? I can't get a hold of you or Chris, and now I'm officially that sister. [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] KATE: [ON PHONE] Hello, Megan... Let the wine breath for a moment before I pour it. This reminds me of our first date. It was perfect. Remember when you didn't wanna buy our picture? Aren't you glad we did? Where's yours? Um... Oh, where is my what, Lloyd? Our first picture. We can put them together. Oh, um... I-it's in my house. Right next to the photo of, uh, Kate and I when we were kids. Um, hey, I-I told you... I told you about my grandmother's Victorian, right? It looks just like this one. Yes. See? I... I hear you. Megan, I listen to you, that's what makes us soulmates. No phones at the dinner table. No, no, no. No phones at the dinner table! I'm not gonna say it again, Megan. Hello, Me... Damn it! Thank you, sweetie. We can tell everyone our good news later. Ah... Now, eat your steak before it gets cold. Here, I'll cut it for you. Protein is the most important part of any meal. Lloyd? Yes, honey. Where did you get those pictures? LLOYD: Hmm, I took them. I had to check on my competition. You-you... Yes. Jack had to go, baby, he wasn't right for you. LLOYD: A yoga teacher, really? At least, Chris was a lawyer. What... What was? And Pete, he didn't appreciate you. I will never take you for granted. Ever. [BREATHING HEAVILY] [CHUCKLES] Delicious, right? Mmm... Come on. FEMALE 3: The police are on their way up. What's Dr. Lessner's password? Um, um... "Feelgood." As in doctor. Okay, good. Got it. [BREATHING HEAVILY] This had to be a meal to remember. Our first... in our new house. That's very considerate of you. Oh, I cannot wait for you to meet mama. I'm so glad we could get past all the obstacles that she said were in the way. My father was the first obstacle that's why I removed him. You know, I learned early on that you can have any thing your heart desires if you just remove the obstacles. You're right. I... I deserve more. You do. [CHUCKLES] I'm so happy. Kate, you know you could do this on your phone, right? I don't have the app. It takes too long to download. Advantages of having the same password. Come on. Got it. Oh, thank you, beautiful Cloud and complete invasion of privacy. Okay, this is the address. Uh-huh. Alright. It's a hostage situation. It's Megan. Alright. That's her phone. Tell them I'll meet them there. Will do. Okay. It's just you and me now. Forever. [CHOKING] Megan? What are you... What? Megan? What are you doing? Stop! Stop! Are you... Don't do this. No! Are you trying to... No! What're you doing? Stop it. Mama spent... [GROANING] Megan! What's it gonna take to get you to stay? You don't want me to do something drastic, do you? Do you, Megan? Do I have to do something drastic? No! No, no. No. [SOBBING] I think I've lost a little trust for you, Megan. Trust... is the most important part of a relationship. Can I trust you, Megan? Yes. Can I trust you? Yes. Yes. You can. I love you. [GRUNTING] [SIREN BLARING] Megan! It's okay. It's okay, you're safe. It's okay, you're okay. You're safe. [SOBBING] He, he killed Chris. No! No, no, no. He killed Chris. Megs, look. [SIRENS BLARING] Come here. Come here. You're okay. You're okay. [SOBBING] It's okay. It's okay. You're okay. You're okay. LLOYD: Megan! Megan! No one will ever love you the way I love you. Mama said "grand gestures." Mama said... Mr. Murrow, drop that knife. Mama said... Drop the knife. Mama said, mama said... Drop it! Okay, come on, kid. Mama said... FEMALE 4: Hands behind your back. Hands where we can see 'em. Put your hands behind your back. LLOYD: Mama said, mama said... Mama said, mama said... Mama said, mama said... Mama said... [INDISTINCT CHATTER ON RADIO] [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [SIRENS WAILING] You're okay? I'm so sorry. What do you mean? Don't apologize. You didn't do anything wrong. [SIGHS] Aren't you glad you're okay? I mean, you know you're not... I mean, you know you're not great, but... You're okay. Yeah. Hey, uh... Let's get married, okay? I'm-I'm not in shock. I am completely clear. Are you sure? I have never been more sure about anything ever. Give up all this? Shut up. I love you. [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] [MUSIC CONTINUES] [MUSIC CONTINUES]
