[ominous music] [Officer On Radio] 10-4 I'm leaving 13th Central. Five QSK. - [Dispatcher] Five QSK. - [Officer On Radio] Five QSK, hold that M6, going the way of Tim Gorman with things. - [Dispatcher] 10-4. - [Officer On Radio] All clear to Central. [ominous music] - [Willis] That was some shit. [ominous music] - What the fuck is wrong with you two? - Oh shit it's you. - You were supposed to meet me in Jackson Heights 30 minutes ago. We specifically told you not to come straight here. - We had to shake 'em somehow. We had to take a different train. - You weren't supposed to take the train. Just get in the fucking car. - Well actually we have to go back to Barnes. - [Tim] We have to go back to my house to... - Get in the car. [ominous music] Let's go. Both of you out this side, come on, come on. - It's 'bout fucking time he's got here. Where the hell have you been? - These two geniuses thought it would be funny to get off at Bedford instead of Jackson Heights. - I know what the fuck happened. And you, did you park around the corner two blocks away like I said? - Not yet, I couldn't risk these two walking that far without trying to make a break for it. - What the fuck is wrong with you. Anybody watching this place would find that mighty suspicious, don't you think? Get the fuck outta here. - All right, all right I'm going. - You two come here. You morons are in deep shit. We're all in deep shit thanks to you. The plan was simple, you get in, you get out. That was step one, you fucked that up. Step two, meet the driver at the Chrysler Building, then he takes you to meet Jimmy at Jackson Heights. But you didn't do that. Instead, you take the subway, at an hour when hardly any trains are running. - We panicked, we were trying to throw them off the trail. - I don't care what your reasoning was. We set it up the way that we did to get you out of there as quickly as possible. Now you two are on camera. Entering the station at Grand Central and then getting off at Bedford. Where do you suppose the police and the FBI will be combing over after seeing that? - How did Jimmy even know where to find us? - How did he know where to find you? After what just happened that's your question? How did Jimmy know where to find you? I think a more appropriate question would be, what can I do to stay out of cement shoes? Your cellphones you idiots. They're still on and tracking. Rick where's Jimmy right now? - One block away. - I swear to God, did I or did I not say two blocks away? - You said two. - So there you go, we've got you going into Grand Central and then coming out at Union Square and then again at Bedford. Then we were able to guide him street by street. We should have had him kill you on the spot. - Why didn't you? - Because it's not up to me. I wish it were. The Executive is here. - The Executive? - He wants to talk to you before we decide what to do about this fiasco. Don't move. - Shit now what do we do now? - Stay clam, we need to figure out what we're gonna say to him. - Well what we're gonna say to him he doesn't already know Steve - Got damn we were so close, okay, okay. We just need to placate them long enough so we can figure out what we're gonna do. This place is roughly the same distance from my place, is where they dropped us off so we can just get out of here. I know we can find my way back to my place, we can drop the fuck-- - We're not gonna find a way out of here Steve. Okay, if we do, what do we do then? - You want to just stay here so they can set a sink 'cause that's what they're gonna do. - Okay, say we find a way to get to your car without getting killed first, then what? - Go back to my van and find the nearest police station and turn ourselves in. - What? - They'll have to let us in police protection right? For what we know witness protection. - We don't know anything. - Let's go, he'll see you now. [ominous music] Sit. [ominous music] - It would seem you two have failed me. Both of you work for Solar Mate, a green energy company specializing in solar power. Corporate headquarters located in the Chrysler Building. The company was set to receive a one time subsidy from the federal government in the amount of 600 million dollars, but that was put to a halt. So what happened? You have my permission to speak. Maybe I should rephrase the question. Why was a halt placed on that one time federal subsidy of 600 million dollars to Solar Mate? - Sir the new attorney general, raised a red flag against allegations that Solar Mate might not be 100% legit. - What would give anyone that idea? - The Solar Mate facility in Southern Nevada is nonexistent. The address is in the middle of the desert, just outside the town of Pahrump. - That sounds like the perfect place for a solar panel company. Surely Solar Mate could use that 600 million dollars to at least start building that facility. - The facility was supposedly already built when the subsidy was approved. - Well now, that is a problem. Now let me ask you this, if the new attorney general began an investigation of Solar Mate and found it to be a fraud, what do you suppose your salaries would be? - Nothing. - And if the attorney general met an untimely death and no investigation was begun into Solar Mate, what do you suppose that translates to? A piece? - Two million dollars. - One certainly sounds nicer than the other. Mr. Geiger is not a progressive man. He believes solar power is unsustainable, but we can't waste our time trying to educate lost causes. If a high profile politician is stupid enough to pay for a hooker using a credit card, well we can't let opportunity like that pass us by. Do you know who I am? - What? - What's my name? - You want your birth name? - Yes. - I don't know. - Did he see your faces? - Yes. - Did he say anything to you? - Yes, who sent us. - And you said? - Nothing, that's when we bailed. - I'll have to check that out. I hope you haven't lied to me. I'm going to split you up Mr. Willis, you will remain here. - Sir we could go someplace disappear. Someplace that no one would ever find us. You don't have to kill us, we wanted him dead as much as you do. - I never said I was going to kill you. I didn't become the business man I am today through knee-jerk reactions, I wait until I've exhausted all rational avenues. Whether you live or die isn't up to me anyway, it's up to Horus. - Horus? - Horus, the sky god. This is the age of Horus, neither you nor I make these decisions, only Horus. [ominous music] If he speaks to you, don't hesitate to act on it. It would be an honorable death that would save us all a lot of headache. [ominous music] - What the fuck. - Okay Congressman Wexler, this is Richard Hill, CEO of Solar Mate. I'm here with four fresh faces straight out of college. Tim Barnes, Steve Willis, Michelle Allen, and Kevin Andrews. - [Wexler] All right, wonderful. This is conversation is now official and being recorded as of 12:35 P.M. [Tim whispering over Wexler] - Either way get ready for the asses. - Okay Congressman, let me reiterate Solar Mate's continued commitment to green energy as well as the tremendous strides that we've made at our facility in Southern Nevada. - [Wexler] Well thank you Mr. Hill. And I've been in touch with out mutual friend out there, Bill Gray, numerous times recently. Has nothing but good things to say. - Bill is a great guy. But sir please excuse my forwardness, what kind of numbers can we expect from the federal side? - [Wexler] I still need to run it by backing committee, but seeing as it's all but approved, we can expect anywhere between 550 to 600 million. And the senior senator from Nevada has already pledged to lobby the state. They'll be happy to have the jobs coming in. - Now I'm sure they will. Have you spoken to the president yet? - [Wexler] Yes, he gives his approval. You know he's willing to do whatever he can to support green jobs. - Well I'm sure he'll be very happy with us, I have no doubt. [group gasping excitedly] I'm sure bonuses are in order. - I told you, we should have called Mason. - Padraic Mason, he's too expensive. - Because he does the job right. - I was just trying to be cost effective. - I would have gladly paid him out of my cut to not be in this bullshit. - Well thank you for offering that early on. - 600 million dollars is out the fucking window 'cause you entrusted two accountants to pull off a high level assassination. - You shut your fucking mouth. What you want us to do with them? - Nothing for now, call Mason. - Sir why do you want Mason? Not even he can get close to Douglas Geiger now. He'll be protected beyond belief. - That's not what I want him for, we need to hire him before anyone else hires him and sends him after us. - With all due respect sir, we got six guns to his one. I think we can handle that skinny Irish drunk. - Sir, I'm with you. I don't think... - Call him. ♪ Don't miss this, there's no time to waste ♪ ♪ Don't want to live at last ♪ I'll just throw the chase ♪ You just walk it in and out ♪ Open your tiger's eyes ♪ They'll catch you up deep down inside ♪ ♪ My gifts of love you try to hide ♪ ♪ Gets on my years until I find ♪ ♪ Yeah - No answer. - Get me the latest. - Yes sir, standby. [loud knocking] - [Hill] Come in. Ah there he is, have a seat. I wanted to talk to each of you guys face to face. I know you're all hot shit so, that's why I took a chance and brought you into this company. I'm gonna be flying down to DC tomorrow to testify, so we can get approval for the loan. - It's a loan now? - Well you know what I mean, the subsidy. Congress wants reassurances before they release all the funds even if it's just a drop in the bucket. So I'm gonna need you all to have your ducks in a row on the numbers side. - How much should I assume we're receiving? - Let's go with 600, make 'em think that's the amount we need. I know for sure that the Nevada facility is gonna need at least 400. - All right. - Is something wrong? - Well did you see who they just appointed attorney general? - Yeah. - And how do we account for him? - Douglas Geiger is all talk, all of them are. It's like when you apply for a job. You tell your employer whatever it is he want to here. It all settles in and go a round on saber back, a little bit here and there and all in all, it'll be business as usual. - And if it's not? - Look our stock price just went 23% in the last few days. We'll tack those proceeds on what we get from the government and before you know it this company will be producing affordable energy for years to come. I mean who can repurpose that? It's all good, don't worry about it. [glasses clinking] [upbeat music] - Well that's about it, last call. You want anything else? - No, I think this will do. - All right. - How long has this place been open? - Ah a little over a year. - Not a bad spot, nice and quiet. - You a cop? - What makes you say that? - We mostly get law enforcement in here, you know usually end of shifts. That's why nobody else is here. - I see. Detective Rosso. You must be former law enforcement huh? - Something like that, retire and opens a bar that cops frequent, is that a stereotype? - Might be. - Them days are long gone. Happy enough just to be a bar owner. - If I were you I'd find somebody else working this shift. These hours are for the birds. - I don't mind it, it gives me something to do. [phone ringing] Excuse me. [phone ringing] Hello. - [Computerized Voice] The dragon's tail is long and scaly. - [Bartender] Who's sending that call? - [Computerized Voice] The serpent's dagger has been sharpened. - Thank you, goodbye. Well I guess most bars stay open to three now huh? - I think so, yeah. - Nothing much good happens after two that's for sure. - I could vouch for that. [phone ringing] Well I guess it's my turn now. Rosso. Uh-uh, yeah I know the place. You think they're still there? Okay, I'll get that way. - On my way to Brooklyn, apparently I'm the only one that can check out an empty warehouse. - You still on the clock? - Something like that. - Good luck. [suspenseful music] - Tim, Tim can you hear me? I knew this was weird, this, this is fucking crazy. [gun cocking] - I say you let me go in and just blast 'em both in the head. - For once Jamie, you and I agree. Sir that seems like our best option. - No, not yet. I'm not done getting information out of them. It may be we don't have to resort to that. We may be able to send them away. - Yeah well I say you send them to some shit box, like Damascus, Detroit. - Nothing significant happening with the NYPD. - Try Mason again. [phone vibrating] - Still nothing. - We got to move on without him sir. [man groaning] [loud knocking] - Hey what's up? - Hi Michelle, you know just chilling trying to crunch some numbers like you usual, what's up with you? - I have an awesome task of repairing the talking points. - Oh fun. - Not too hard, I just have to beg and win, it doesn't sound like begging. - Yeah. - I don't suppose you'll be done soon will you? - Actually I was just about to call the Nevada office. I have to get a full rundown from them, so it might take me a while. - Shoot, I really didn't want to have to take this home tonight. It's only so much I can do without plugging in the numbers. - I'll hurry as fast as I can but no promises. But if it does take me too long, I'll buy you a drink. Okay I'm sorry, but come on, you can't blame a guy for trying. - I'll think about it. But, if I see you working slow on purpose, the answer's no. - That sounds fair. - [Automated Female Voicemail] You have reached the Solar Mate facility in Pahrump, Nevada. No one is able to take your call at this time. To speak to a representative at our-- [phone banging] You have reached the Solar Mate facility in Pahrump, Nevada. There you are. Thought I missed you. - Well I'm flattered but I'm not gonna be gone that long. - I haven't been able to finish crunching the numbers yet. - Oh Jesus Christ man, I leave first thing in the morning. Walk with me. [elevator dinging] - I have called the Nevada facility a number of times, nobody has ever answered. - So what? - Does anyone even work there? I mean I called maybe 15 minutes ago, nothing. - What does that have to do with accounting? - Well I'm gonna need a complete rundown from them, otherwise I'm not gonna be able to crunch the numbers. - No, no, I told you before, put 400 down for them. - Sure, but without an itemized breakdown from them I'm not able to complete my-- - Wait a minute, stop, stop, hold on. Don't get all wrapped around the specifics here. You know the only reason I had you doing this is because we don't have an accountant down on their end as of yet. Look all we need to focus on right now at this moment is convincing Congress to fork over the money that we need. - Right, but don't you think they're gonna wanna know exactly where the money's going specifically? - Steve we're talking about people that pass bills that they've never read. Look, all we need to do is tell 'em what they want to hear. And that's what I have Michelle working on right now okay? - Okay. - I'll see you when I get back. Don't worry about it. [liquid falling] - Drink. Red is fine. - Yes sir, red's great. - I hate white. I don't trust anyone who takes white over red. Only Philistines drink white. You haven't touched the blade. Most others in your position would have waited by the door, blade in hand and put it to my throat when I came back in. Then you could have used me as a bargaining chip to get out of here. Ah but what if one of the others walks through, maybe their life has no value to me. Maybe then we shoot through them to get to you. Or maybe you've just been waiting to be alone with me again so you can put that blade through my head. Maybe trying to get out of here isn't your mission at all. Maybe you've been co-opted by some third party to work against me, is that it? Some anti-progressive voice has convinced you that I'm the enemy because I put my money where my mouth is because I believe I'm one of those who should be in charge of making this world a better place. Is that it? If that's the case, go for it. You've done the math already, you're an accountant. You've taken into account that I'm much older, I walk with a cane, so I must not be that overpowering. And while this wine may weaken me that much further. This very same wine which I have so graciously given you and which you are not drinking. Could give you the courage to follow through and strike me down. Someone hired you to purposely botch the assassination so you can be the police or the FBI or whoever directly here to me, am I right? Tell me I'm right. - No sir, that is-- - Don't lie to me. Sorry about that. I know that's not the case. I know that's not the case because you aren't quite that smart. Oh don't get me wrong, you're smart enough in the sense that you were able to get a job as an accountant with a major company. Cunning, that's the word I'm looking for. You're more on the honest side. Which I greatly appreciate in this situation. - I have no reason to lie to you sir. - That's not true. But you haven't lied to me yet. I know that and for that reason, I should give you a bit of honesty. I'm a bit dismayed with one of my captors right now. He did not properly follow my orders. You see the person who I would have wanted to carry out this job was never contacted. Mason, he's a professional. The best. Not only would he have completed the job but he would have brought me his head, like I asked. - The attorney general's head sir? Yes, I had a whole ritual planned. It isn't always about the money, you see. [horns honking] [train bells ringing] - So you were going to sacrifice his head to Horus? - Is that some sort of joke? Do you think I'm some sort of satanist or something? After all I've done for you. I've given you your life, some wine, a piece of honesty, and yet you sit there and mock me? - No. - Because I've been patient, I've showed restraint. People who mock me, they end up like Douglas Geiger. Goddammit, you've failed me. You've failed me and yet you have the balls to mock me? Steve Willis, always bringing on about how the numbers don't match up, the numbers don't match up. But the help never happened to do as you were told. - I was only trying to do my job. - Help prevent an investigation. Well congratulations, you did a bang up job of preventing that. - Sir. - What? - There's someone outside. [ominous music] - And. - It's a detective, asked for you by name. [ominous music] - Bar the door, make sure this one doesn't get out. - Yes sir. - What you want us to do? - I'll handle it. But standby. - You got it. [ominous music] - Good evening. - Evening. - I didn't realize anyone was using this space. - Well, there is. - I got a report of suspicious activity, vehicles coming and going, foot traffic. A lot of things going on for this time of night. - I see. - I don't suppose you could fill me in on the situation in there can you? - We've detained two of my employees, there were supposed to make the attorney general stop breathing and as you know by now they failed to do so, so I'm trying to decide just what to do with them. - Hey Tim, you see anything? You know you're short, listen. - I'm not sure who called it in, someone saw one of your guys bring 'em in gun drawn. With everyone circling around Geiger right now, I was the only one available to come here. They're fortunate. - They've all been sloppy tonight. - I'm sure someone out here raised a flag. But any chance some one in there is working against you? - No, they all stood to make too much money from this. - But now it's all gone south. Some of them may be thinking, it's still making time. - They know better. - I'll do what I can to the Lady In White, PD. I'll say I saw nothing, the building was empty, some prank. In the meantime though, I'd make sure no one's working against you in there. And be quick about your decision with the two. - I will. - Don't worry sir, Horus will see you through. - That he will. It's Rosso isn't it? - Yes sir. - Thank you for your help. - Sir I'm sorry, but like I told Frank I-- - Shut up, you've given me enough of a headache as it is. You didn't search them when you brought them here did you? - What do you mean? - I mean one of them has a wire or a tracking device attached them. I want it found. - Yes sir. - Then I want all of you searched in front of me, don't let there be anything to find. [upbeat music] [both laughing] - You're a sneaky bastard, you know that. - I told you if I had known we could just make up numbers, I would have given him the notes right away. - Yeah right. - Did I really set you back that much? - Yeah, I can only talk about how evil oil is so much, that and the sustainability of green energy. Extra jobs and all. - Yeah but I don't have exact numbers. - Apparently that doesn't matter. Like I said, you can just make up whatever numbers you wish. I was told a 400 million dollar blanket, that's assuming it's a unionized gate, that would be a minimum of $30 an hour for a big run. That doesn't include the freak benefits and the executive you know compensation to allow to managers to oversee the operation. I've tried to work out the numbers but then my head started to hurt and I gave up. 5,000 that's a nice round number. - Is that realistic though? - [chuckles] No, not at all. But like Richard says, it doesn't really matter. We just have to tell Congress what they want to hear. [upbeat music] - So why now? - Why now what? - This? - I don't know, I just thought it'd be fun to hang out. - Oh shit, you're so transparent. - Don't paint me in the corner. - I thought we agreed that working in the same office is kind of a huge obstacle. - Yeah, we didn't agree to that. You just said that to get rid of me. - That's not true. - That is true actually, and I don't know what the big deal is, I thought that we had something kind of nice. - I just don't want a boyfriend right now. - You mean you don't want me for a boyfriend right now. - Steve. - Michelle. - I didn't say that. - But you should say that. You know just for future reference you should be upfront with the guy because you know when you try to put us down gently, that's an invitation for us to try harder. - You know Richard wouldn't approve. - Hmm yeah, what is Richard, our emperor. Richard, what he doesn't know won't hurt him. - Okay, that works too. [upbeat music] [phone ringing] - Hello. - [Computerized Voice] Romeo, Oscar, Sierra, Sierra, Oscar. - Well shit. [ominous music] [phone vibrating] Fuck! [ominous music] Alpha, Romeo, India, Echo, Sierra. [ominous music] [phone vibrating] - Oh shit. - What's wrong? - Work, what time is it? [ominous music] [Mason sighing] [ominous music] - Somebody's gonna shit. - Sir they're clean. - Tell them to put they're clothes back on. - You don't want to see if for yourself? I'll just tell them to, yeah. - Now you all will do the same thing. [keys clicking] - [Computerized Voice Mail Voice] You have reached the Solar Mate facility in Pahrump, Nevada. - I still can't get ahold of the Nevada office. - [Tim] That's so weird. - No one will answer the phone and I have to get specifics from their end to do my job. And how can I do that if no one will talk to me. - Did you leave a message? - Yeah I've left several messages. Nobody calls me back. - Just give it time, they are like three hours behind us. - Yeah but if they're as busy as everybody says they are, somebody should be there to answer the phone. [ominous music] - Oh sorry, I didn't know anybody was in here. - You're good Kevin. Did you tell Richard? - Yeah, he says not to worry about it. You know put them down for a bland 400 mil. - Okay, just do that then. - I'm not gonna put my name on some half ass financial report. Besides a lump sum of 400 million, that's an immediate red flag. - Okay, what does that mean? - First off, Richard tells me to get the books in order and give them to the feds and next he doesn't want any specifics. Aren't the feds gonna come here looking for the numbers? - The feds are the ones approving the loan Steve. - Yeah and you think they're not gonna wonder what exactly we're gonna do with 400 million dollars? - Yes that's exactly what I think. Do you know what insignificant 400 million dollars is in the grand scheme of things? It might as well be pennies. - You think Douglas Geiger's gonna take that same attitude? - [scoffs] I don't know what you want me to say to you Steve. [ominous music] - I know. [ominous music] [horns honking] [phone ringing] Steve Willis. - [Emma] Richard knows why no one answers the phone. - Excuse me. - [Emma] He doesn't want to tell you because you're new, he doesn't trust you. - Okay, who is this? - [Emma] You don't have any work left for the day, so you could leave now. Get over to Brooklyn Heights-- - No, no, no, no, wait, who is this? - [Emma] Keep your voice down. Go to Brooklyn Heights and wait there, I'll come to you. - Where exactly am I gonna go? - [Emma] You choose, I'll find you. [phone beeping] [ominous music] - That search doesn't prove anything. One of you said something. - I have as much to lose from this as you do. - Actually you have more to lose, I would say. I can always distance myself from Solar Mate and move on to the next venture. I can be the one that points out that Solar Mate is a fraud, publicly. That might raise the question as to was behind the attempted assassination tonight. - Sir you're exactly right. We have no recourse here. Why don't you just send us somewhere where no one will ever find us? - Yes, you mentioned that before. Where would you like to go? Aruba, The Bahamas, maybe. - I mean that or Alaska even. - Alaska. [chuckles] Want a fresh start in Barrow, do you? [men laughing] - I'd rather be dead. - [Thug] Same here. - I can tell you right now that neither of you is going anywhere until one or both of you admit to purposely botching the job. - You already saw that I wasn't wearing a transmitting device or a wire. - That's not what I'm talking about. We've moved on from that. As you already know there was a detective from the NYPD here a little while ago. Somehow he knew to come to this exact spot. How do you suppose that happened? - He drove us here and parked in front of the door and escorted us here at gunpoint. - Fuck you, don't pawn this off on me. - Hey he's right about that. I'm just saying, somebody nearby might have seen something. - Gentlemen, this night will not last forever. While we have decided to shelter you until things settled down but now the clock is ticking. And you need to tell me everything and you need to do it now, no matter how insignificant the detail may seem. I want to know. - Oh well. [ominous music] [keys clicking] [computer beeping] Oh shit. [ominous music] - It was Emma Pierce who convinced me to go to Nevada. - Wait, who, what? - Emma Pierce. - Who is that? - You didn't send her to talk to me? - Do you know that name? - No. - Stop looking around like a moron. - Am I allowed to look at you? - Yes, you like you're about to make a drug deal. - Can I ask your name? - Emma, Emma Pierce. - And I take it you already know mine. - Seeing as you answered the phone saying Steve Willis, then yes. - Yeah right. - The Solar Mate Nevada complex won't take your call directly. - So do you work for Solar Mate too? Okay, so why won't they answer my calls? - Because your name is not Richard Hill and they're not organized in a way that you would understand. - That makes no sense - Would you like me to tell you why you're here? - 'Cause you asked me to come here. - No because you're asking questions beyond your pay grade. - I'm just trying to do my job. - Unless your title is CEO, CIO, CFO, or something like that, your job is to follow orders. Look, I'm not saying I wouldn't do the same thing. You're pissing in a pool with no chlorine. - How 'bout you give me some information that I can use. - You're being watched. - Oh no shit. - Not just by me, they're at least two other parties involved. - Why? - Why else? 600 million dollars is at stake. - I just want to balance the books, is that too much to ask? You know I want to cover my ass in case the feds come looking around the corner. - Stop crying, you're gonna benefit from the company's fortune, just let it go. - So who's watching me? - You don't wanna know. - I do actually. - I can't give you any names because I don't know. But one of them, is a certified psychopath. - [Steve] Great. - He makes a lot money doing what he does. But he is incredibly paranoid. The best thing to do is just give. him a reason to ignore you. [ominous music] [Mason scoffing] - The fuck. - Oh good, you're awake. - Who the hell are you? - You know who I am. - Oh shit, fucking Mason. - [Mason] That's right, minus the fucking. - [Rosso] Look Mason, just kill me and get it over with. - [Mason] Now, now, let's not jump to any conclusions. - Why not, I know that's what you want to do. - Do not presume to know what I am thinking. - Well it can't be much, all you Marines are the same. - All right, let's play nice now. - You don't look like much. - That's the whole point, counterintelligence. - Blending in huh? I've give that to you, you do that well. - Even better with time. - No shit, we've been looking for you for a while now. - So what's the problem? - No one knows what you look like, until now. I'm guessing that's a fake name. How do you even pronounce that? - Padraic. - Irish cocksuckers. - Easy. - No wonder they wanted to hire you. You work for them or someone else? - Uh, who is them? - You know who I'm talking about. - Look Detective, I'm not drunk right now but I'm buzzing pretty good, I'm kind of in that in between stage where you kind of wanna go to bed, you know. So let's cut out all the riddles and bullshit and not make this night go any longer than it needs to. - I already told you to kill me and be done with it. - I haven't even decided if that's what I'm gonna do with you yet. - Fuck you, I heard the same goddamn thing earlier tonight. I'm trying to decide what to do with them or some bullshit like that. We all know he's gonna kill them once he's got whatever information he needs. - Okay that's good, now let's clarify who he and they are. - Jesus Christ what did I say to you earlier. You Marines really are slow. - Motherfucker I said enough with the riddles. As far as I know you're talking about your gay lover. - You knew to come find me but you don't know the suturation? Some professional you are. - Look I was woken out of a sort of sound sleep so not all the information was transmitted, you got me? - Oh great, so you just pick me up and now I got to fill you in drunkie? - Okay well now you're just being rude. - The job, you asshole. The job you was supposed to take. Ring any bells? - Ah no, I take jobs all the time, take not give, so no, no bells rung. - The attorney general. - Shit. - Yeah exactly, so why didn't you take it, money not enough? - Hmm, I can't recall actually. - I fucking knew it. What did they offer you, five mil? You know if it were me they would have offered 500K or something minuscule like that. Five million dollars isn't even good enough for you? You greedy cocksucker. - Okay, first of all, envy is greed's retarded cousin so go fuck yourself. Second, if you say cocksucker one more time, I swear to God. - Swear to God what? What the hell you doing? - Shut up. - Are you still drunk? - I said shut the fuck up. - Shit. - Oh Jesus Christ, I thought I told you to stay put. - I wanted to see what was going on. - You just interrupted an interrogation. - It didn't sound like it was going too well. - Yeah, now I have to start all over again. - How'd you know I was back there? - I just knew, why don't you leave the sneaking around to me. - You know she was there, wow I guess you really are that drunk. - Shut it. - Who the hell is that anyway? - It's nobody okay. - Nobody, is that what I am to you, a nobody? - That's not what I meant. - [Emma] Fuck you. - You pick her up at a daycare? - We're both older than we look. Hang on, fuck I'm sorry that's not what I meant. I just, I'm tired, I want to get this over with, I wasn't expecting you to show up. It's history now, so that's all. - You're so full of shit. Why do you insist on doing everything without me? - I don't do that. - You do it all the time. Even when we first started seeing each other you were hesitant to bring me along. - You called me a psychopath. - That was before I knew you. Right around that same time you called me a cunt. [both laughing] - Well you know, that's a term of endearment. - Oh really? - Oh yeah when you say oh that cunt with the... Fine, come on. Would you like to join me on this job? - Do you mean it? - Yes. - I accept. - You're so hot. - [Emma] You are. [kissing loudly] - What the fuck. - I've got work to do. [dramatic music] - Oh. - Fuck I'm sorry, it's nothing to worry about. Oh, one day I'll fall straight. - Better someone here than on the subway. - Hmm? Oh yeah, sure fine. [dramatic music] - [Emma] Richard knows why no one answers the phone. - [Steve] Okay, who's this? - [Emma] You don't have any work left for the day, so you could leave now, get over to Brooklyn Heights ASAP. [dramatic music] I can't give you any names because I don't know. But one of them, is a certified psychopath. [dramatic music] - [Mason] Fucking cunt. - You're telling me that none of you sent her to talk to me? - None of us know her name Mr. Willis. Go talk to Rick. - Well all that did was make me want to dig further. I had to see for myself. - [The Executive] Had to see what? - The Solar Mate facility in Southern Nevada. - And what did you think of it? - Aside from the sand, the jagged rocks, being completely off the beaten path, and nothing manmade, it was great. - Then what happened? - Two SUVs pulled up full of people to escort me back to McCarran Airport. They had checked me out of the hotel already and they had my suitcase with them. When I got back to New York there was someone there to drive me directly to the Chrysler Building. Where I was escorted upstairs to Richard Hill, our boss' office. From there he explained to me what would happen. From here on out. - Sit down. I don't know of any company that allows its employees to take off whenever the hell they want, do you? - No sir. - So imagine my surprise, I'm down in DC trying to bring back 600 million dollars of guaranteed subsidies for this company, and I get back to this. One of my employees has run off to Las Vegas without telling anybody. - I didn't go there for gambling, I went there for business. - I know what you went there for. - How did you know where I was? - Come on Steve. - How do you think I knew? - You've had people watching me. - Of course I did. I would have had only one person but I was advised to have at least one more. - Advised by who? - We all have our bosses. - You're the CEO. - That's right, I'm the CEO and you're a goddamn accountant. So when I tell you to do something, you fucking do it without question. Do you understand? Fucking millennials. While you're sitting there typing your little numbers in, I'm getting called on the carpet by the attorney general in DC. Douglas cocksucker Geiger. That's why I had to spend a few extra days. And don't tell me I told you so because I don't want to fucking hear it. He's managed to put a halt to the whole goddamned thing. - Why are there no facilities in Nevada? - What the fuck Steve, can you just stop arguing please? - What do you mean why are there no facilities? - I mean why is there no facility? You think we're in a shit storm now, wait until Geiger finds out that minor detail. - Are you threatening me, you little shit? - What, no I'm just saying that-- - Because I will fucking bury you. So for it's only been binoculars and listening devices, but that can easily change to rifle scopes. You want to take back that little threat? - Sir that was not a threat, I'm just saying that we are a solar panel company that doesn't make solar panels in a facility that doesn't exist. - Willis, what is it you think you do here? [Willis stammering] - I'm not sure what you mean? - There never were any solar panels, there were never gonna be any solar panels, there's no money in that business. If there were we wouldn't ask the feds for it. We'll get the money, wait a couple of months and we'll file for bankruptcy. Explain to me how solar panels are practical. They look like shit and they're wildly ineffective. - If you didn't believe in this cause then why start the company? - Because lobbying can only rake in so much. What I don't understand is why would you care? You were gonna be making a lot of money from this transaction and now you're standing in the way of it, why? - Because I don't want to go to prison for years for fraud. - Mm-hmm[affirmative]. - You won't, I have a way to correct the situation. - You do? - Of course I so, that's why I'm the CEO. - You're gonna fire me, aren't you? - Don't be ridiculous. As a matter of fact you're still in line for the same bonus as we discussed. - Oh really? - Geiger, has made us his pet project. He's gonna be in New York tomorrow night. Staying at the Fitzpatrick Hotel, room 254. He has an appointment at 12:30 a.m., the woman's name is Amber. Only Amber's not gonna show up, you two are. - Yeah, something tells me he's not gonna be in the mood to talk business. - Drink. Go ahead Frank. - What the fuck. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait, fuck. [gun firing] - The next one goes in her head. - Motherfucker what did you do? - What did I do? What did I do? You fucked me, now I'm gonna fuck you back. - She has nothing to do with this. - You're right she had nothing to do with this. But she's gonna fucking die because of you. Unless, unless you two swinging dicks show up at the Fitzpatrick Hotel tomorrow night at 12:30 a.m., room 254 and make Douglas Geiger go away. - How the fuck are we supposed to do that? - I don't know that's your problem, figure it out. But if you succeed, Michelle goes away unharmed. Your mother wouldn't have to have her house foreclosed on, the company gets 600 million dollars and you two guys, get two million dollars a piece. It's a win goddamn win. - All right, so where were we? Oh yeah, the attorney general. What was the name of that company? Some green energy bullshit or something. - Solar mate. - [scoffs] Wow, okay, yeah. I think I remember. Something about he was gonna see a hooker but I was gonna go in her place or something like that. I guess it wasn't the worse plan in the world. - But why didn't you take it? - It felt like a trap. It seems like he could have been discredited just for seeing the hooker. Fuck, what is it with New York and politicians and meeting hookers? Spitzer, Seiner, now Geiger. - Geiger's not from here. - [Emma] We know and neither is Seiner. - Okay noted, but he got caught here or would have been. It seemed like an assassination was a little over the top. - Yeah, well be glad 'cause the guys who went in your place fucked it up. - Okay, now we're getting somewhere. Who went in my place? - I don't know, two guys from the company. - Wait what company, Solar Mate? - Yeah, two accountants. [Mason laughing] - Well of course they fucked it up. Wait you know what? I think I may know who you're talking about it. Fuck I wish I had my book with me. - [Emma] Now are you glad I came along. - Thanks babe. Oh yeah, here we go. Steve Willis, Tim Barnes, yeah cased them for about a week, got an even million dollars for that one. Wow, those two went in my place? Those two are a couple of killers, believe me. - Steve is how I met my Padraic. - Hold on, I thought that wasn't your real name. - It's not. - So is Emma her real name? - I don't think so. - Do you two even know each other's real names? - [Both] No. - You two are a couple of freaks. - No doubt, so where are they now? - They're being held at a warehouse in the Brooklyn Navy yard. - Held by who? - The same people who hired you to keep tabs on them. - And they haven't killed 'em yet? - Not that I know of. - Why not? - I don't know, The Executive must think they're holding back some information. - Richard Hill is a paranoid fucker. - No, not Richard Hill, Richard Hill is the CEO of Solar Mate. - Right, they're the ones that hired me to surveil. - No they're not, it was The Executive's people who hired you. - Okay, and who is The Executive? - I don't know his real name. - You don't know his real name? - Really motherfucker? - Oh yeah, touche. Oh God. - [Emma] What is it? - Oh geez, it's someone bound to having too much time and money on their hands. Really it's a narcicisstic thing. Some cultist bullshit. You don't actually believe in that crap do you? - Fuck yourself. - Exactly, The Executive huh? I think I may know who that is. He is doing the whole cane and hood thing? Oh that's too good. - Cane and hood thing? - You got to see this for yourself, it's beyond stupid. - What's beyond stupid is you not realizing just who he is. He's extremely powerful and influential. - Yeah, yeah, blah, blah, he's an all power being except for the part where he needs me. We're gonna need the address to that warehouse. - I'm afraid to say another word. I want to know what you're gonna do with me. - Don't worry you'll be fine. - That's not an answer. - We do need to think about how we're gonna get rid of him, now that he knows what we look like. - Two people in a city of over eight million. Plus he don't know our real names. - We shouldn't take that chance. Let's just kill him and be done with it. - I'm right here. - As far as I know he hasn't really done anything to deserve that. - Okay, what then? - I got to get in contact with Bruce. - That leaves just one thing, why is Douglas Geiger still alive? - He wasn't alone, one of his handlers was still with him. Tim was supposed to distract him and I would be the one to pull the trigger. - What happened? - Well we were only set to kill one person. The second made me hesitate and by the time I snapped out of it, Secret Service was already alerted. - What happened to the gun? - I threw it down the nearest storm drain. - So someone else was in the room with him? - Yes. - Someone who knew to be there. - We were told the coast would be clear at 12:30. - Back off. [Michelle whimpering] [gun cocking] - Just say the word sir. - What the fuck is this? - This is the culmination of an evening full of lies. - We haven't lied to you about anything. - Bullshit, you're both working against me. I want to hear you say it or the bitch dies. - If we were working against you we wouldn't be here right now, we would have found another way out. - More lies, and it might be the detective shows up by accident, no. Now say the words, I want to hear a confession. - We have done everything we were told. - Blow that cunt's head off! [Michelle screaming] - No wait, wait, wait. I confess. [Michelle whimpering and gagging] I talked to the FBI, you're right. Geiger's man he knew to be there to make it look like things just didn't line up properly. There were supposed to track our movements so they know where to find us. That's why I left my cell phone on. - Why aren't they here right now? - Must have lost the signal. That detective, either they sent him fishing or he was the wrong detective to send. Tim did not know anything about this, only me. Obviously the signal on my phone failed so they don't know where we are. You can send these guys on their way, just don't kill them. - I wish you had told us this much sooner. Like I told you, it would have saved a lot of headaches. And we could have avoided that spectacle just now. - I was trying to buy some time. I thought maybe they would be here by now but I guess they're not coming - No, I guess they're not. Well I had a whole ritual planned for this evening and it looks like I can still carry one out. Thank you for volunteering Mr. Willis. - [Thug] Let's go. - Fuck. [computer buzzing] Damn. [computer buzzing] - [Computerized Voice] The number you have dialed is not in service. - Shit. [computer buzzing] - [Mason] 'Bout time, what happened? - Cyber attack, what else? We need to move fast. - [Mason] No shit. - Standby, I'll give you the address. - [Mason] I already got it, I talked to your detective friend. - What did you do with him? - [Mason] You'll hear soon enough. I need your backup on my audio from the past two hours. - All right I'll just rebooted, it'll take a second. - [Mason] Also, I need you to dig up all audio I had from Willis from the past week. - All right will do. All right the south end of the building will be facing- - [Mason] Whoa hold on now. Now before I go any further, I'm gonna need the confirmation of an account transfer. - We don't have time for that, I told you we need to move fast. - [Mason] Not my problem. So far I've been working for free, so five million now or I wash my hands. - I don't even know if my guy inside can do that right now. He said it's urgent we need to enter the building now. - Oh you should have said that before we talked. I only got a partial transfer. - I told you it was a cyber attack I had to disconnect. - So tell them to stop busting your balls. You're the former CIA not me. - Hey if they had gotten that information, somebody else would be breaking into that building not us. And by the way, if you had answered the phone when I first called you, I would have been able to transfer all information to you before the attack. - I'm hanging up in five, four, three, two. - Alright, all right, fine, it's not gonna be instantaneous. I need you to stay on the line. - All right. - In the meantime, you continue on. - Fine, I spoil you though. [dramatic music] - Okay, okay, he says standby. - Do we have a head count? - Seven hostile, four friendly. - Any bodies outside? - No, all inside right now. - Okay, so I copy seven hostile, four friendly, two assaulting. - Two? - Yeah, make sure he knows it's two of us coming in. - Hey when were you gonna tell me. - Right now, don't worry, she's not a liability. - She, hey what the hell are you up to? [dramatic music] - All right, he's about to start the ceremony. No one is supposed go go inside for any reason, got it? - Okay. - I've got to go to the vehicle and get out something for afterwards, we're about to do some weird shit in there. - What is it? - Don't know, don't wanna know, can you hold down the fort? [dramatic music] - I think so. - All right I'll be back. [ominous music] - Shit one just left the building. - Yeah, I got eyes on him. - All right, so you in position? - Maybe. - I've got transfer confirmation. - On your RN2? - It'll take a minute to show up on this end. - Oh then I stay. - Come on if he says he sent it then he sent it. - I haven't hung up yet. [ominous music] - 'Bout fucking time he gets the inevitable. - This wasn't the inevitable, it was supposed to be a decapitated head on my desk. But sometimes Horus throws up roadblocks to test our metal. We just have to make the best of a bad situation. - So what are you guys gonna do now, now that Solar Mate is not gonna get the bailout? - Shut up. - It's all right Frank, he's on his way out anyway. Mr. Willis, you're an accountant, you know how investment works. You donate money to an incoming administration and you get paid back for your trouble. It's a return on an investment, that's all. We've done it plenty of times before. Granted it's not usually so eventful, but occasionally someone gets in the way and we just have to deal with it. Solar Mate's demise is unfortunate but we just have to regroup. - So what's all this? - Well two things, clarity and consolation. [dramatic music] - Where are you gonna send those two? - No where. - What do you mean no where? - When I said to them the money was special. - That's the whole reason I confessed. - We never made that arrangement. - Then why would you send them in the other room and leave me in here? - Because, I wanted to know which one of you talked. And the one who talked, would take Douglas Geiger's place this evening. - You never said that. - Don't you worry there Stevie boy, Michelle will be very well taken care of before we send her on her way. - Hey Michelle, Tim, you got to get outta here! - [Frank] Shut your fucking mouth then. [dramatic music] - That should be enough smoke Frank. I found the passage. - Come on, come on. - Tick-tock. - I'm still waiting. [dramatic music] - Hey. - Holy fuck, you scared the shit out of me. [dramatic music] - Do you want to have some fun? - Do what? - I said, do you want to have some fun? - You mean like right now? - Mm-hmm[affirmative]. - Shit, actually I have something I need to do right quick. - Fuck it, who cares. - I do conjure thee, oh thou Belial, I call the most glorious and efficacious names of the great and incomprehensible lord god. Thou comest quickly and without delay from all parts and places of the earth and world wherever thou may be, to make rational answer unto my demands. And that speaking with a voice intelligible unto mine understanding as a for-ce. I conjure and constrain thee oh Belial, my all the names of for-ce. Where with Solomon the wise bound me and my companions in a vessel of brass. And thou appearest here before this circle to fulfill my will in all things that seem good unto me. [dramatic music] [wood crashing] [dramatic music] - Come on, it won't take long. - Listen, you have no idea how bad I want to, but I have to do this thing first. - Promise you won't regret it. - Goddammit this is the worse timing ever. - Okay I confirm on my end, go. - Okay, 10-4 all right, radio silence. [dramatic music] - Okay, I tried. [gun firing] [dramatic music] - Thou shall purge me with hysop oh lord. [dramatic music] Amen! [gun firing] [dramatic music] [gun firing] [dramatic music] [gun firing] [dramatic music] [gun firing] [dramatic music] [gun firing] [dramatic music] [gun firing] [dramatic music] - Who are these? - Tim Barnes and Michelle Allen from Solar Mate. - Oh right. [dramatic music] - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'll probably get so sick here in a second. - I wish you would have told me you talked. - I didn't. - What do you mean you didn't? - The story I gave 'em I made up. [Steve gagging] - I'm sure that's not because of you. - You see what I was talking about right? - Yeah, wow. - His account's been completely drained. He has other assets but we're not gonna be able to get to them. - The man who broke the Bank Of England, destroyed the Malaysian currency. Still wanted in France for insider trading. He who shall not be named. Known only as The Executive. - You have to let me finish the ceremony. - Why? - I summoned Belial for clarity. I need his advice on what to do next. - I'll handle that from now on. - Fuck you, you have no say in this. Only Horus can determine what happens next. [man yelling] - Is Horus making me do that? I should have shot you in the leg, I could have made an honest man out of you. - You were supposed to work for me you asshole. What do you think you're going to do now, just walk out of here? I've got connections, NYPD, FBI, they know I'm here. You'll never make it out of the city. - Yes, yes I know you have connections. One of them Detective Rosso, gave me the same speech. That is before we dumped him in the East River. You say you conjured Belial, how do you know I'm not him? Ah I'm just fucking with you, I don't believe in that shit. - What about the others? - You drained this asshole's account right? - Spread it around. - Yeah get them out of here, tell 'em keep their heads low. Get rid of Day, wine, all the legal. [dramatic music] - And who might this be? - This is Emma. - Bruce. - Not to meet you. - Likewise. What did you guys do with Rosso? - He got wuss? - You what? - We told him we'd be watching him, and we had audio of him at the warehouse and the time he's with us. - You're gonna watch him? - Fuck no, we're gonna get the hell outta here, at least for a while. - Oh really, where you gonna go? - We're not sure yet. - Well it's still Richard Hill running around. - Three survivors are from Solar Mate, they can testify against him if need be. You have the audio from the other night? [dramatic music] - [Willis] She had nothing to do with this. - [Richard] You're right, she had nothing to do with this. She's gonna fucking die because of you. - Oh good stuff, all right. That should do it. I guess the only thing left to do is scrub the NTA footage of Willis and Barnes. I think we're good. - What about The Executive? - He's chained to an SUV right outside the warehouse. It's wired to blow, just call this number, it's a cell phone bomb. Or dial 9-1-1 and tell them about the six corpses inside the warehouse, your choice. [Mason mumbling] - All right you crazy kids, I'll think about it. - [Mason] All right I'll see you around. [phone beeping] [phone ringing] [dramatic music]
