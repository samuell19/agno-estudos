(Shereen) V-I-C-B, V-I-C-B, yeah, Vic! V-I-C-B, V-I-C-B, yeah, Vic! Uh, maybe, maybe I should go with Ariel, mom. I want to have a little talk with you, Vic, if I might. Well, he's worked pretty hard for me tonight and maybe I should better kind of go have a drink with him or something. Jay David's been lookin' forward to talkin' about something, Vic. Let the boy suit himself, Connie. - How are you, Mrs. Bealer? - Hi, honey. What did you hear from your daddy, Drenna? - 'Still liking Europe?' - Guess so. - How are you, Vic? - Who's that? You know Drenna Valentine, Vic. Shall I save a seat for you? Next time, you tell them they could send me. I told High next time he wants to go to Europe he should send me. I just never seen her grown up. You call that grown up? (Jay) 'He means with all that money.' I'll come out to the stockyard tomorrow, J.D. I'll see you then, okay?

I mean, it's, it's real clear to everybody that.. '...you're a real strong boy.' Not if I don't start getting to bed. Like last night. You, you proved to everybody it'd be nothin' for you to take the West Coast title. And probably after that, the nationals, real easy. What are you talking about, J.D.? What I'm sayin' is.. Well, I asked Connie if she thought it'd be alright if I talked to you. And she said she thought it'd be alright. Well, after all, all he could do is throw that left at you and.. ...and I said, What left? So, now, I'd like you to think about it. I mean, not tomorrow or the next day. You could wait till after tom.. After the finals if you want to. 'Or if you want the Olympics. They mean so damn much to you.' But how old are you, Vic, getting to be? Okay, I'm not any kid. You know, you're not any kid anymore. That's what I'm sayin'. Tempus fugits. 'Well, there's a lot of truth in that.' What are you driving at, J.D.? I mean, not that you're old or anything. Hell, man, I'm really beat. What are you getting at? I've been up all night. Hell, maybe you'll never turn pro. I don't know. But what I mean is, well, if you did.. ...you wouldn't sign nothin' with nobody else, would you? [indistinct shouting] [sheep bleating] I know that Ariel knows a lot about boxing 'and there's a lot about boxing that I don't know.' You don't know a damn thing about boxing, Jay. Well, that's why I brought it up. I mean, it was because I wanted you to know.. Well, I'm prepared to quit out here. I mean, whenever you're ready to make the big decision. 'And get behind you 100%' and give my whole time to workin' for you. 'I just wish you hadn't opened up your mouth, Jay David.' 'Goddamn you.' - 'I'll see you later, Jay.' - 'Hell, Vic.' (Vic) I just wish you could have kept all that crap inside yourself. - But you couldn't, could you? - Sure I can, Vic, hell. You hurry home now before this gets unfroze. ♪ Does he love me?

'I guess it was always a pretty cruddy place.' 'Used to, we'd always find rubbers a lot.' I like it up here. Don't see them so much no more. Oh, man. If this place could talk. The stories it could tell, I suppose. Stories it could tell. 'If these trees could talk. Huh?' You know what my record is for non-sleep? Didn't you get to sleep last night? Three days once when Larry come to LA. All the excitement, I suppose. Me too. Did you ever bring Janelle Sharkey up here? Nah, hell, you don't bring no girls you're serious about up here. Just pigs. - Should I turn on the radio? - 'Except..' No, it's alright in the daytime. [song on radio] [laughs] Oh, Vic. You have such a sense of humor. That's all I got. I ain't tellin' you no different. You'll have whatever you want someday. - Yeah, I know I will. - 'Cause I'm sure of that. (Vic) Hell, I'm sure of it too. Your people in Europe or what? They're comin' home. What is your dad, a major, or what, in the army? What did you hear from Janelle? - Sharkey? - She's still in El Paso? Far as I know. You a friend of Janelle's? I didn't know if you were still going together or just what. I don't go with no one. That's what I told Terilyn Idey. That Rockoff was just nothin' but a big liar. - Rockoff? - I don't go with nobody either. How do you mean Rockoff is a big-- I think going with people is asinine. You know Rockoff? You see people going together and they're just standing still. What's eating Rockoff? What's he tryin' to pull? Well, he's just saying that Lovette's getting all these letters from Janelle, that's all. Lots of people get letters. That's exactly what I told Terilyn Idey. What is? That it was all probably just lies. Well, what is? I don't gossip, Vic. What, is she having a real ball down there, I suppose. Who? - Janelle. - 'Where?' In El Paso. She's in LA. LA? 'For one thing Rockoff can be glad' 'you don't know what he's saying or you'd knock his block' clear off if I know you. What's Rockoff tryin' to pull, Drenna? Are you my friend or not? [sighs] Well, it just makes me sick. Because what business is it of everybody's even if Janelle did have a baby and.. '...you tried to say it wasn't yours?' 'Cause if she don't care enough about you to write you that she's down in LA when she's writing everybody in town and telling them she's married some creep down there and made a record and everything. She made a record? Yeah, she went to LA and made a record, Vic. 'Somebody's gotta tell you.' Yeah. So, what are you suppose to do, Vic? Honestly, I don't blame you. As far as I'm concerned, she really messed up.. ...and missed out on something really great last night because I still can't catch my breath. 'Cause you're a thousand times better than any Janelle Sharkey. What you thinkin'? I ain't thinkin' nothin'. A person's always thinking something. Not me. Sometimes they might not know it but they've always got something on their minds goin' on. His own mother-in-law caught him layin' his wife's sister. 'And wife caught him layin' a 15-year-old babysitter.' 'So, what's he talkin' about me for all over town' is what I'd like to know. And anyway, she told me she was gonna have an abortion. 'Ah, if I get some little kid of mine walking around..' 'Hell, I'm not gonna just stand here' 'and let my name be smirched.' 'I can always tell when you've got somethin' on your mind.' Jesus, Bealer. What's the matter with you? What'd you do that for? I told you I was gonna do something. Come on, let's get out of here. Hell, take the cops an hour to get out here from town. What's the hurry? Let's have a beer. [singing in foreign language] - It's broke. - 'What do you mean?' - 'What, what's broke?' - My hand, damn it. We should stop chattering, Vic. It's getting on my nerves. Yeah, well, what about you? I'm afraid of anything I might say. Go on, talk. I probably wouldn't understand it, anyway. Or pretend not to. How old is he? Thirty-two. Why? No, I mean, uh, the.. - 'Your, uh..' - Dewey? What kind of a name's Dewey? Almost 12 months. Are you going to stay? 'Yeah, and when what's-his-name comes home, what do I do' 'just move over?' He won't be coming home. He's a National Guard. I should never have came to LA, Janelle. 'Oh, boy, here we go.' This isn't the kind of person you are, cheatin' on people. Or me either. We're good people. - Here or in the living room? - I don't want no coffee. Where's my coat? Yeah, well, it's a pretty interesting place you got for yourself, Janelle. Naked asses in the living room. - It's a Pablo Picasso. - Don't mean nothin' to me. It doesn't. Shereen could do as good as that. You don't mind my correcting you, do you? Not if you don't mind I don't pay no attention. 'It's not a weakness to talk good, Vic.' Can't even tell which is a woman, which is a man. Maybe they're neither... or maybe they're both. Yeah, that's what they.. In Hollywood, that's what you probably are is neither or both. Well, this is very interesting, Vic. This is very revealing. Why does it threaten you? I'm glad you think so. 'Why does your manhood' 'have to depend on what you can reject?' Just because I don't like naked asses in the living room all of a sudden I'm revealing? You won't let anything flower, will you? Oh, boy, Janelle, you sure got phony. You won't let anything take hold and grow. I'm just glad that people in Butte can't hear you now. - That really bothers you. - See? See, what's happened to you. Well, I got out of Butte and you're still stuck back there. You make one record nobody's ever heard of and, oh, boy, she turns Hollywood! That's right, go. - Into the night. - I'll see you, Janelle. There's just one thing I wanna tell you, Vic, then you can go. - Yeah? - Don't look so worried. Hell, I ain't worried. - You want some coffee? - Hard. Let me turn off the coffee. Yeah, I'll have some coffee. I should never have seen you again, Janelle. I know that much. Don't be such a damn boy scout. No, you're married. This is what you decided to do and this's what you did. 'It ain't my fault.' You're so sad. Come on, Janelle. You're so phony. You're the most pathetic person I've ever met. 'Cause you could be so much.. ...and you won't be anything. Oh, yeah? When I get this bandage off I'm gonna go to Pan America. Vic, I love you. That's all. I never stopped. That's all I have to say. No, well, heck. I knew all we'd have to do is see each other again and we'd be all over each other again, all over again. That's not what I said, Bomber. Oh, well, heck. I was gonna say, too, that I.. I didn't either. I do too. Never stop or anything. When you love someone.. ...you never stop, or I-I don't know. Some things just don't go away, no matter where you go. Are you going to stay? I don't have no place else to go. (Arty) 'Shit, sure, he signed.' 'The originals are with the commission.' And the yellows, they got and I seen the blues down at the office myself. Yeah. Hi, you old bastard, what do you say? What's your business? State your business. Gee, what's the matter, Arty? I came in to see you. Thought I'd workout. Five bucks a month to members. Hell, Arty, come on. This ain't no flophouse or free show. Hell, if you weren't a friend of mine. What'll I put, Curley or Vic? Whatever your name is, you put that down. Have to go pretty slow at first though on account of I broke my hand up in this prison match up north, knocking out this-- Five bucks, please. Okay, Arty, when you get hungry, I'll take care of you. So, don't go worryin' about any five bucks, for cryin' out loud. What's five bucks? I just didn't wanna humiliate you with offering to pay. That's all. Here's 50 cents. I-I'm just gonna watch today on account of my messed up hand. Fuckin' bastards. Boy, are you in a bad mood? If you weren't an old man, I'd have to throw you downstairs. - Come at me, motherfucker. - Hell, I wouldn't touch you. You'd probably have a heart attack and I can't afford the flowers. What do you want? Hell, man. I've been finally thinking of going pro. Yeah, pro what? So I might be looking for a good manager, so be careful. - Happy hunting, asshole. - Just because I run out on you. Arty, hell. I didn't run out on you, I had to go somewhere. I was coming back. I don't want you back. You old fart. I wouldn't pay to take a crap in your fucking gym. You goddamn pain in the ass, freeloadin' zombie kids.. [door slams open] '...'comin' around hustlin'.'

Because a white fighter without responsibilities is not reliable. 'Middle-class white son of a bitch without goals' 'will usually break your heart.' You think he can win the nationals at St. Louis?

I'm not wasting no more time on punks who'll only fight so they don't have to work steady at nothin' live off their loyalties or royalties or laurels, whatever you wanna call 'em. A few amateur bouts in a boys' club or, or a rehabilitation prison mates. Ari! I'm sorry, Vic, but that's the way I feel about it. 'So that all their lives they could tell themselves' they could have been something. And who'll ever know the difference? Let's go! Ari! [instrumental music] Oh, my.. There they go. [indistinct chatter] True love is waiting and hoping and praying and sacrificing, Vic. And being happy and not being afraid. - Who says I'm afraid? - Keep smiling, Vic. Because our love is strong enough to face any problem that faces us. - I know that. - I don't love you. I just seen you coming, that's all. Because the search for happiness is one of the hardest things in life to find. But when you find it with a person.. I may be young, Vic, but I know what I'm talking about. You're just asking for it, Drenna. Go away. Because true love is good times and bad, Vic. It's consideration and sharing and understanding and, a-and praying together and waiting, Vic, and sitting down and talking and doing what the other one wants to. Go on, Drenna. Go home. Are you just gonna leave me hanging here in midair? Not knowing if it's over or what? It's over. Goodbye. It's just not knowing, Vic. I feel like you're pushing me away from you and I.. ...I'm just supposed to hang here in midair. And the dumb part is, I really do understand.. ...and I don't really expect you to jump on any white horse and carry me off. [instrumental music] [instrumental music]
