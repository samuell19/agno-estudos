I WEAR A SINGLE ROWEL. YOU SCRATCHED YOURSELF WITH A MEXICAN SPUR. I'LL DO IT. [CLANK] YOU SURE GOT A ONE-TRACK MIND. OR DID YOU FIGURE ON USING THIS AS A CRUTCH?

AND WE FOUND THE OLD MAN WITH THE CATTLE HE WAS AFTER. HE'S A KILLER, HIS TRIAL WILL TAKE CARE OF IT. IF RODEN DON'T TAKE CARE OF IT FIRST. WHEN HE BURIED HIS BOY, KNOW WHAT HE PUT ON THE MARKER? "HERE A FATHER'S HEART IS BURIED." A MAN WITH NO HEART MAKES A BAD ENEMY. THANKS. NO LAW AGAINST CLEANING UP AFORE EATING, IS THERE? SIT DOWN, LEN. WE AIN'T EATING. GET SADDLED UP, BOYS. I THOUGHT WE WAS STAYING THE NIGHT. RODEN'S MEN ARE AFTER HIM. WE MOVE FAST, WE'LL LOSE THEM. WE CAN'T MOVE THAT FAST. WE'LL HEAD THROUGH THE DESERT TO SANTA LOMA. THE DESERT? THIS IS AUGUST, MAN. NO SELF-RESPECTING RATTLER WOULD TRY TO CROSS THE DESERT IN THIS HEAT. YOU'LL NEVER MAKE SANTA LOMA THATAWAY. WE GOT NO CHOICE. THE OTHER WAY, RODEN WILL BE WAITING. I DON'T AIM TO HAVE US ALL KILLED. LET RODEN HAVE THE OLD MAN. HE AIN'T MEANT NOTHING BUT TROUBLE TO US. SURE. GIVE HIM UP, JUGHEAD. SAVE YOUR OWN HIDES. WE'RE LEAVING NOW ACROSS THE DESERT. LOOK, I KNOW IT'S TOUGHER, BUT THEY WON'T FIGURE ON US TAKING THE LONG WAY AROUND, AND EVEN IF THEY DO, WE'LL HAVE A NIGHT'S RIDE AHEAD OF THEM. PACK UP, BILLY. COME ON, POP. SUPPER'S OVER.

MARSHAL, I'M SORRY TO CAUSE SUCH A TO-DO, AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR COMING-- I AIN'T DOING THIS ON YOUR ACCOUNT, MISTER. IT'S THE LAW. IF YOU'D KILLED 10 MEN, I'D STILL TAKE YOU IN.

THAT'S WHY I DON'T COTTON TO YOUR PROPOSITION. I DON'T WANT HIM ON MY TRAIL THE REST OF MY LIFE. HE WON'T DO ANYTHING TO YOU. NO, BECAUSE I AIN'T TAKING NO CHANCES WITH HIM, AND YOU BETTER NOT, NEITHER. BILLY WAS KILLED. HE DON'T LIKE YOU FOR IT. HE DON'T LIKE YOU AT ALL. YOU AND ME, WE'RE IN THE SAME BOAT. WE GOT TO STICK TOGETHER. ME AND YOU? HUH! I'M THE FELLA THAT KILLED YOUR BROTHER, REMEMBER? BUT YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T DO IT. AND YOU BELIEVED ME? YEAH, SURE I BELIEVED YOU. YEAH.

LOOKS LIKE YOU HAD TOO MUCH SUN. WELL, WE GOT TO DO SOMETHING. WE JUST CAN'T SIT AROUND AND WAIT TO BE KILLED BY THAT MADMAN. ALLOWING YOU HAVE A POINT THERE... WHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT IT? THEY GOT GUNS. WHAT DO WE GOT? WE GOT THE GIRL. THE WHAT? SHE CAN HANDLE HIM. THEY BEEN OUT THERE FOR-- UH! HA HA HA! GO ON, KILL EACH OTHER OFF. HA HA HA! Lou: OH, LET THEM GO. LET THEM FINISH IT.

GET BACK THERE. HA HA HA! YOU BETTER GET SOME SLEEP, TOO. I'LL GET PLENTY OF SLEEP IN SANTA LOMA AT THE END OF A ROPE. THERE'S NO TELLING HOW A JURY WILL VOTE. YOU AIN'T HOPING I'LL GET OUT OF IT, ARE YOU, MARSHAL? I DON'T LIKE TO SEE ANYBODY HANG. HA HA! WOULD IT BE ON ACCOUNT OF... I REMIND YOU OF YOUR POP? NO... IT AIN'T THAT. FOR HER? ANYTHING WRONG WITH THAT? NOT A THING, EXCEPTING YOU AIN'T HANKERING TO SEE ME HANG, AND I AIN'T, NEITHER...

THAT WATER WILL KILL US ALL. WITHOUT WATER, NEITHER US NOR THE HORSES GOING TO GET TO SANTA LOMA. WHAT DO YOU AIM TO DO NOW, LEN? HALF A DAY'S RIDE WOULD BRING US TO THE GUADALUPE RIVER. HE'S RIGHT.

Lou: THAT GUN YOU'RE HOLDING AIN'T GOING TO STAY AWAKE ONCE THEM EYES IS CLOSED, NEITHER. YOU ALL HAVE TO SLEEP, TOO. WE DID SLEEP, LAST NIGHT, AND WE'LL SLEEP AGAIN, TOO. AFTER WE REACH SANTA LOMA. WE AIN'T STOPPING THE REST OF THE WAY. WE'LL SLEEP BEFORE, IN THE SADDLE. YEAH. ONE AT A TIME, WHILE WE'RE WAITING FOR YOU TO CLOSE YOUR EYES JUST FOR A SECOND. SWEET DREAMS, MARSHAL. WHEN YOU WAKE UP-- IF YOU DO WAKE UP-- YOU AIN'T A-GONNA FIND US HOLDING YOUR HAND. SO WE'LL JUST SAY GOOD-BYE NOW, POLITE-LIKE. WAIT A MINUTE. YOU RIDE WITH ME. THAT WAY, YOU CAN SAY GOOD-BYE EASIER. LEAD OFF. HE CAN'T LAST MUCH LONGER. I FIGURED HIM TO CAVE IN LONG BEFORE THIS. YOU WON'T GO BACK ON YOUR DEAL? LET HIM CLOSE HIS EYES ONCE, AND YOU'LL FIND OUT. YOU WON'T REGRET IT ONCE HE'S OUT OF THE WAY. I WON'T REGRET IT, BUT IF YOU DON'T LIVE UP TO YOUR END OF THE DEAL, YOU WILL. I KNOW YOU'RE TIRED. I'D LIKE TO STOP, BUT WE'VE GOT TO KEEP MOVING. ANN... I'M SORRY THIS ALL HAD TO HAPPEN, BUT I DON'T BLAME YOU. YOU FOUGHT FOR YOUR FATHER THE ONLY WAY YOU COULD. GETTING HUMAN? FORGETTING YOU'RE THE LAW? WE GOT NO CAUSE TO FIGHT NOW. NOT NOW...WHEN ANY MINUTE, WE'LL BE BUZZARD BAIT. WE'LL MAKE IT. LEN, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? LEN, WAKE UP! WAKE UP! Lou: WE'VE GOT HIM.

THIS IS THE CHANCE WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR. LEN, WAKE UP. WAKE UP! LEN. NOW IT'S LEN. NO WONDER YOU'RE STICKING UP FOR HIM. CAN'T YOU UNDERSTAND I'M TRYING TO SAVE YOUR FATHER? I'LL SEE YOU BOTH ACROSS THE BORDER SAFE. AIN'T NO ONE GOING TO BOTHER ME. I'LL BE THE BOSS OF THE RODEN RANCH. I'LL BE THE BOSS OF THIS WHOLE TERRITORY, NOW MY BROTHER'S GONE. YOUR BROTHER? YOU SURE AIN'T MUCH IN MOURNING. POP! NOW THEN, DRILL HIM. DRILL HIM! THEN WE LEAVE. NO. NO! WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? YOU GOT THE GUN. USE IT WHILE YOU GOT THE CHANCE. HERE. YOU TAKE IT. I'M NO GOOD AT KEEPING THE LAW. YOU KILLED HIM. WHY DIDN'T YOU FINISH THE JOB? HOW STUPID YOU ARE. LOU GOT YOUR RIFLE. POP KILLED HIM TO SAVE YOUR LIFE. YOU'RE WASTING YOUR TIME, ANN. HE'S JUST A MEAN AND NARROW MAN. YOU HAD YOUR CHANCE. YOU LET IT PASS. YEAH. SOMETIMES A FELLOW CONFUSES HISSELF. I HAD MY NECK OUT OF THE NOOSE, AND I STUCK IT RIGHT BACK IN AGAIN. ALL RIGHT, MARSHAL. SPEAK YOUR PIECE. YOU'VE GOT THE GUN, AND YOU'RE THE LAW. WHAT'S YOUR NEXT MOVE? WE BURY LOU. START DIGGING. WE GOT NO SHOVELS. USE YOUR HANDS. AND AFTER THAT, LOOKS LIKE WE'LL USE OUR FEET. [BIRDS SINGING] CONGRATULATIONS, MARSHAL. YOU'VE GOT WHAT YOU WANTED. THERE'S SANTA LOMA. HEY, HONEY, GET OVER HERE. Len: FOLLOW ME. WE'VE BEEN EXPECTING YOU FOR 3 DAYS, MARSHAL. WE GOT DELAYED. ALL RIGHT, SHERIFF. THEY'RE YOURS. MARSHAL MERRICK? YES, SIR. I'M JUDGE MORROW. WHERE ARE YOUR DEPUTIES? DEAD. HE ANSWERS FOR ONE OF THEM WITH HIS SON. AND THE OTHER? HER FATHER KILLED HIM TO PROTECT ME. RODEN, YOU CAN SHARE YOUR SON'S CELL. MR. RODEN HAS ASKED BAIL FOR HIS SON. THAT COYOTE? HE'D BE IN MEXICO BY MORNING. AND FOR MYSELF? ALL RIGHT. YOU WON'T RUN. NOT WHILE KEITH'S STILL ALIVE. BAIL IS $5,000. COURT WILL BE IN SESSION IN 3 HOURS. YOUR HONOR... YOU'RE NOT GOING TO START THE TRIAL THIS EVENING, ARE YOU? I HAVE NO CHOICE. I'LL TRY KEITH TONIGHT, THE RODENS TOMORROW. I'M DUE TO HOLD COURT TUESDAY IN PUEBLO. JUSTICE. THAT'S WHAT YOU PROMISED, AIN'T IT? I TOLD YOU WHAT HE'D GET. CATTLEMEN'S JUSTICE! A TRIAL IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT SO AS YOU CAN HANG HIM QUICKER. ARE YOU SATISFIED NOW? [CRYING] Judge: YOUNG WOMAN, I CAN UNDERSTAND YOUR ANXIETY FOR YOUR FATHER, BUT JUSTICE DOES NOT VARY WITH THE TIME OF DAY. YOUR FATHER CAN RECEIVE AS FAIR A TRIAL IN DARKNESS AS IN DAYLIGHT. [BANGS GAVEL] THE PEOPLE OF THIS TERRITORY VS. TIMOTHY KEITH. DO YOU SOLEMNLY SWEAR TO TELL THE TRUTH, THE WHOLE TRUTH, AND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH, SO HELP YOU GOD? I DO. THAT MORNING, ED WAS ABOUT BEFORE DAWN. HE WAS ALWAYS THE FIRST ONE UP AND THE FIRST ONE OUT. HE WAS BORN TO THE RANGE. WELL, ABOUT SUNRISE, HE HEADED UP TOWARD THE NORTH SECTION TO HEAD IN THE STRAGGLERS. IT WAS THE LAST TIME I SAW MY SON ALIVE. I SAW MY BROTHER LEAVE. IT WAS JUST ON 6:00, AND I WENT ON BACK TO THE RANCH. MY FATHER HAD ASKED ME TO ORDER UP SUPPLIES. DAN HAD PUT HIS FATHER IN A BAD TEMPER. HE COULDN'T SEE WHY THE BOY DIDN'T STIR HIS STUMPS LIKE HIS BROTHER. HE TOOK HIS BEEF OUT ON THE REST OF US, ROUSTING US AROUND TO GET GOING. HARDLY WANTED TO GIVE US TIME FOR BREAKFAST. SOON AS WE HAD BREAKFAST, HE SENT SAM WEAVER AND ME OUT AFTER YOUNG ED TO LEND HIM A HAND. WE FOUND HIS BODY JUST ON 10:00 UP IN A GROVE OF COTTONWOODS. HE WAS LAYING WHERE HE FELL, WITH A HOLE AS BIG AS A DOLLAR BLASTED IN HIS BACK. THE GROUND AROUND WAS TRAMPLED WHERE THE CATTLE HAD GONE THROUGH. JAKE WILSON AND BILL JEROME HAD JOINED US BY THEN, AND WE FOLLOWED THE CATTLE TRAIL. HIGH NOON, WE CAUGHT UP WITH THE KILLER AND THE CATTLE, 12 HEAD OF THEM. HE DIDN'T GIVE US ANY FIGHT. COULDN'T. HE DIDN'T EVEN PULL HIS GUN WHEN WE RUN HIM DOWN. GUESS HE WAS TOO AFRAID TO MAKE A MOVE, BUT HE SURE LOOKED GUILTY WHEN WE GOT HIM. I STOLE THE CATTLE RIGHT ENOUGH. AIN'T NO SENSE PRETENDING I DIDN'T. BUT I'M TELLING YOU STRAIGHT, I NEVER KILLED YOUNG ED. HE MIGHT HAVE FOLLOWED MY TRAIL, BUT HE NEVER CROSSED IT. THE ONLY TROUBLE IS, HE AIN'T HERE TO PROVE IT. Man: THE DEFENSE RESTS. Second man: PEOPLE REST. [BANGS GAVEL] WAIT A MINUTE. YOUR HONOR? I'M A LAW OFFICER. A MAN'S CHARGED WITH A CRIME, I BRING HIM IN. ONCE HE'S IN A CELL, MY JOB IS DONE, AND IT'S UP TO A JURY TO DECIDE WHETHER HE'S INNOCENT OR GUILTY, AND I'VE NEVER LET MYSELF CARE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. THIS IS DIFFERENT. HE HAD MY GUN AND COULD HAVE KILLED ME. INSTEAD, HE USED IT ON THE MAN WHO WAS TRYING TO KILL ME. BUT I AIN'T SPEAKING FOR HIM BECAUSE HE SAVED MY LIFE. THAT'S NOT WHAT MATTERS. WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THAT HE HAD HIS CHANCE TO RUN AWAY AND DIDN'T TAKE IT. A KILLER DON'T GIVE UP THAT CHANCE. HE'D RUN FROM THE NOOSE NO MATTER WHAT. I GUESS THAT'S ALL, BUT YOU GOT TO KNOW, HE'S INNOCENT. YOUR HONOR, MAY I ASK THE MARSHAL A QUESTION? Judge: PROCEED. ARE YOU IN LOVE WITH THE DEFENDANT'S DAUGHTER? YES, SIR. Lawyer: THAT'S ALL, YOUR HONOR. I'LL STAND BY THE JURY'S VERDICT. [PEOPLE ALL TALKING AT ONCE] [GAVEL BANGS] [GAVEL BANGS] GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY, HAVE YOU AGREED UPON A VERDICT? WELL, I'LL TELL YOU, JUDGE, WE AIM FOR A FAIR AND HONEST VERDICT. NOW, NO ONE SAW THE OLD MAN KILL YOUNG RODEN, BUT YOUNG RODEN'S DEAD, AND THERE AIN'T A HINT OF EVIDENCE AGAINST NOBODY ELSE. AND HE DID HAVE THE STEERS ED WAS AFTER, SO WE'VE GOT NO CHOICE BUT TO FIND THE OLD MAN GUILTY. [PEOPLE TALKING] Judge: THE PRISONER WILL RISE. YOU HAVE HEARD THE VERDICT. THE PENALTY IS MANDATORY AND PRESCRIBED BY LAW. IT IS THEREFORE THE SENTENCE OF THE COURT THAT YOU BE HANGED BY THE NECK UNTIL YOU ARE DEAD. NO! NO! [GAVEL BANGS] Judge: THE SENTENCE WILL BE CARRIED OUT AT DAWN TOMORROW MORNING. ANN. ANN. ANN, YOU CAN'T STAY HERE. IF IT'S AGAINST THE LAW, ARREST ME. YOU FOLLOW THE LAW. YEAH. I FOLLOWED IT. I TOLD YOU WE'D NEVER GET A FAIR TRIAL. HE GOT A FAIR TRIAL. SO YOU'RE SATISFIED. YOU TESTIFIED FOR HIM, SO YOUR CONSCIENCE IS CLEAR, BUT HE DIDN'T GET A FAIR TRIAL. YOU DIDN'T LET HIM! "IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS WHETHER HE'S INNOCENT OR GUILTY." THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID. BUT YOU DIDN'T BOTHER TO FIND OUT. YOU JUST BROUGHT POP IN, AND THAT ENDED IT. WHAT DO YOU THINK I'VE BEEN WALKING THE STREETS FOR ALL NIGHT? SURE. NOW YOU CARE. NOW YOU KNOW HE'S INNOCENT, AND IT'S TOO LATE TO PROVE IT. THEY'RE OUT THERE DIGGING HIS GRAVE, AND IT'S YOU WHO PUT HIM IN IT. [DOOR OPENS] POP! POP! GO HOME, HONEY. NO. I'M STAYING WITH YOU, POP. I AIN'T LEAVING YOU. NO! AAH! GET OUT OF MY SIGHT! YOU KILLED YOUR OWN FATHER, AND NOW YOU'RE GOING TO KILL MINE. POP! POP. POP! [SPEAKING SPANISH] WHAT'S THIS MEAN? HE'S GONE CRAZY. I WANT HIM TO SEE THE HANGING, TOO. YOU GOT BAIL, SO YOU GOT A RINGSIDE SEAT. ONLY FAIR DAN SEE HIS BROTHER'S KILLER DIE. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? ABOUT THE SON HE LOVED AND THE SON HE DIDN'T. DAN KNEW IT ALL THE TIME. SO THAT'S WHY YOU THOUGHT YOUR FATHER POISONED THE WATER HOLE-- TO GET RID OF YOU BECAUSE YOU'D NEVER BE THE MAN YOUR BROTHER WAS. Dan: DON'T LISTEN TO HIM. WHAT ARE YOU DRIVING AT? JUST THINK DAN'S ENTITLED TO WHAT'S COMING TO HIM-- INCLUDING THIS. DON'T BE AFRAID. IT'S ONLY A WATCH. IT SAYS INSIDE, "TO MY SON DAN ON HIS 21st BIRTHDAY." GIVE IT TO HIM AND LET'S GET ON WITH THIS. RODEN, I SAVED THIS FOR YOU. I FOUND THIS IN THE COTTONWOOD GROVE WHERE YOUR SON WAS SHOT. DON'T LISTEN TO HIM. I AIN'T BEEN NEAR THAT GROVE IN A YEAR. I PICKED IT UP WHERE YOUR BROTHER'S BODY LAY. I LENT IT TO ED. HE LOST HIS WATCH, SO I GIVE HIM MINE. YOU LIE. ED'S WATCH WAS IN HIS POCKET WHEN I BURIED HIM. STAND BACK! DROP THAT GUN. YOU CAN'T SHOOT, MERRICK. I LEARNED THIS TRICK FROM YOU, REMEMBER? PUT THE GUN DOWN, DAN. TALK SENSE. YOU WANT ME HANGED? I WANT YOU TO DIE WITH A BULLET THROUGH YOUR BACK, THE WAY YOU KILLED YOUR BROTHER. IT'S YOUR FAULT. EVERYTHING FOR HIM AND NOTHING FOR ME. I HAD TO DO IT TO GET MY FAIR SHARE. I WORKED FOR IT, AND I KILLED FOR IT, AND YOU AIN'T GOING TO TAKE IT AWAY FROM ME! IN THE BACK, YOU COWARD. YOU SHOT HIM IN THE-- DON'T FOLLOW ME. [HORSE WHINNYING] [HORSES WHINNYING] [GUNSHOT] YOU KNOW, IT'S FRIGHTENING WHAT CAN HAPPEN TO A MAN WITH A LAW OFFICER IN THE FAMILY. I TELL YOU, IT'S DOWNRIGHT TERRIFYING.
