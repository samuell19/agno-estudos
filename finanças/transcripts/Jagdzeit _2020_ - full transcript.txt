Enough for today, Mr Maier. You can calculate all you like, but people have to see you now and then. Come, the sparkling wine's getting warm. At least no champagne this year. You financial guys are so humourless. - I'll get you a drink. - Yes. Hello. Did you know that there's even a norm for human excretions? I beg your pardon? Did you know there's a norm for human faeces? DIN-EN-997. My products don't meet any norms. We could hear that. Brockmann. - Maier. - I know who you are. Makes me wonder what you do here. I'm just the party photographer. I've taken some nice shots of you. You have? That's the limit! You dirty bastards! - What...? Deceitful bunch. What happened? Don't be such a hypocrite. Dagmar? Dagmar! I'm dumbfounded. Don't you want to take your things? I don't even want the air from in here. What's the matter? I wanted to tell you earlier but I'm sorry that wasn't possible. We're informing everybody now. Good morning. We the Board of Directors have decided to put management in new hands. The diesel scandal's been very hard on us. Our catalyst division has taken a plunge and we don't know if diesel technology will recover. If we don't act now, Walser won't exist in three years. We were able to hire one of the most well-known turnaround experts of Germany. As our new CEO, Hans Werner Brockmann will ensure that this barge will head for new shores. If you please. Many thanks. Well, nobody who's given his heart and soul... and these people have given their heart and soul... deserves such a discharge. But if Walser is to survive, we need a fresh start, a fresh vision. We'll get this company going again. With joint forces. You. Me. All of us together. He's got no idea about the automobile business. Walser's always made good staffing decisions. Do you know what they say about his farm in South Africa? Ah yes, I've read that too... He's got a retreat near Johannesburg and he throws half of his food over the electric fence so that he can watch the lions feed. May I invite you to dinner at my farm sometime, Mrs... Leuthold. Then you can get your own views about my dark side. I don't think we can afford that. There can't be too many conscientious financiers. Finances too? - Neururer, manager finance team. - Aha. - Walter, secretariate. - Very good. And you, Alexander, have kindly explained the relevant DIN norms. Oh yes? Yes. I look forward to working with you. ?The warrior must first and foremost value his lord with unwavering devotion. Even a useless man unable to do anything in a satisfactory manner is a trustworthy henchman as long as he's completely devoted to his lord. He wants to see you. Thanks. What do you think, can a carpet influence the bottom line? If you stare at it an hour a day... Isn't it abominable? Why did you give this to me? Do you know it? I discovered it years ago. Please. And? Well, our mothers told us to be good. The HR ladies coach us to communicate respectfully, but deep inside... it's quite different, doesn't it? Medieval times? I like you! I think rather you need me. So, are you with us? I don't think your start's very wise. Oh, come on... so sentimental? There'll be new team members. Better ones. A team in which you can use your talents. My offer. I want your answer by tomorrow. I have a few new ones. Management by jeans? When there are washouts in all strategic positions. And management by shark? If you devour all your opponents? Yes, release! Yeah, come, come, come! Pass, pass. Shoot! Oh, what did he smoke? 15th and 16th are fine, and 30th and 1st also. Remember, his exams are in two weeks, you have to help him. Jeanne, I know. Yes. Until something gets in the way. Here he is, our champion! Hi Th?o. That's my dad - he finally made it. - Arno Platter. - Alexander Maier, pleased to meet you. Oh-oh... Doesn't matter. It's part of the job if you're playing at that level. I would have liked to be as fast as him at his age. Okay, shall we? Yes. ...and then he said that I might make the elite junior team! Wow! Not bad. The training camp's in Canada! Two weeks. And then a show training with the junior team of the Vancouver Canucks! So cool! Isn't it a bit over the top... to fly around the world with the team? Climate change again? - You know where you work, don't you? - Yes. If there's anyone who can do something about climate change, it's the car industry. - Right... - Yes. Can I take this upstairs? Got homework to do. Maier speaking. I?m in. My compliments, you're fast. Okay. Yes, I can do that. Till tomorrow. ...particularly urgently I have to point out the quarterly loss of the European division... ...aggravated by the strong Swiss franc we decided to... and so forth... ...and then... Rabea? Could you do chart 7 again? The chart of May doesn't match the numbers. Thanks. Th?o! Get up! Alex! Here. New. Nobody would have noticed it. But yes. Me. Here he is, our financial genius, Mr Maier. May I introduce you to our team! Valerie Kr?henb?hl, human resources, Chandra King, sales, Florian Senn, production, Thorsten Wolf, communication. Rainer Vogel will take over R&D ad interim. Fine. You're familiar with the situation? As a recap, the figures of the current year. After revision of the divisional figures, Walser Catalyst has a quarterly loss of 3.5%. Sorry. A loss, for the fourth time in a row. Only the composite division is still stable, albeit on a low level. We need to set the course for the future. Here I've worked out a few scenarios. Keep it short, I'm at a meeting. Yes? What? Yes, do that. Ladies and gentlemen, if it's important you answer the phone. I've just heard that our plant in Germany's at a standstill. - A big fire in the production facility. - Shit. Welcome at Walser's! Okay, and as soon as you have figures we'll meet the press. In a few hours. It's not yet clear if there's a direct environmental risk. The catalyst factory WalserTec is part of the Swiss Walser Group which has already been hit hard by the VW diesel scandal. Where's the plant report? I'll bring it in a moment. Now! Frank, contact the German colleagues. Ask them for a damage report and an estimate of how long the plant will stand still. I want the figures within an hour What about the conference call? Cancel it, postpone it to next week. Jeanne... I've got a problem regarding the weekend. Yes. Yes, I know. Rubbish, he prefers being at the hockey hall anyway. Yes, okay. Thanks. Here's the estimate of our German colleagues. They can't quantify the damage exactly but it's in the millions. - Single- or multi-digit? - Single-digit, probably. Probably - what does that mean? The fire's still burning. We went through the policies, the damage is only partly... What do you mean, ?only partly? Can't anybody give me any figures? Exact figures are meaningless if there aren't any. In half an hour he's got to go out there and tell them something. Maybe Mercedes has to stop production because of us. So what? We pay a horrendous fine for every minute Mercedes can't produce because of us. If this happens and if the insurance doesn't pay at once we have a cash-flow problem. We won't breathe a word of this. Clear? What's the wording? There was an incident, everything's under control. No grave consequences are expected. We have sufficient resources to weather the fire. That's not true. Do you think I'll spill the fact that a fire brings us close to collapse? You don't have to. But Walser's known for transparency. Transparency's naive. Do you think they're blind? They know us and they can do the math. Let them do the math! We'll react when they turn up with facts. Don't turn the press into our enemy. I like to choose my enemies myself. Better attend to digging up new money. That's easily said. I first have to check if we... Shush. Moaning's extremely boring. I'm not interested in your internal problems, after all we're your best customer and I expect immediate help! Just a second. - The latest update... - Thanks. Be with you in a moment. Get the guy from Credit Suisse on the phone. Yes, I'll do that. Do you get me? Fine. What will that cost us? Are you crazy? 1. No, no, no. 1.5 is my final offer, and a drink at the B?rengasse. Okay. Thanks! Yeah! ...we'll bridge the gap with a loan. We haven't signed anything but it's looking good. See? It works. Yamamoto Tsunetomo says: ?Money will be there if you need it, but a good man is not easily found. Yamamoto's apparently never negotiated a loan. I've got something for you. Not another book, I hope. A casual dinner, bring your lovely wife. If the date's a problem... No, thank you. You aren't a vegetarian, are you? I'm glad! We have to think more radically. Despite the present difficulties we need to pump money into innovation. In the catalyst area we have the greatest potential to lower costs, keyword standardisation. The resulting funds can be used to top up the development budget... We need better figures, not cosmetics. It's not cosmetic. Check it yourself. Nothing happens in Walser's development department. Mr Brockmann, that's not true. Isn't it? I checked what your team's achieved in the past years. Nothing. You're a pure waste of money. Do you know what basic research means? Something expensive. The state's responsibility. There are... some interesting projects in the pipeline. Fine. And that's where they'll stay. What does that mean precisely? Your department may not burn up any money until we've weathered this plant fire. Okay? Fine. Let's proceed. This guy hasn't a clue! So why didn't you say anything? So he can stamp down on all plans? Of course I want to be sure it works. - I thought you tested it? - Of course. It will work. Your mobile, please. What? Come on, hand it over. Thanks. The material's incredibly efficient, I've never seen anything like it. This is the test arrangement. You can see it here. It's heated from above and cooled with water from below. The difference in temperature creates tension and we obtain energy. There. - Ah. - According to our calculations we could lower fuel consumption by 11%. Ehm... 12. That would be... Every politician will kiss our feet. We urgently need more funds. Now we have to build a prototype, then we can show what's in this. I'll see what I can do. ?Nothing is impossible in this world. A firm decision can move heaven and earth, they say. Things appear to be far beyond a person's power because, lacking strong determination, he cannot focus his heart on a difficult project. Sandra, can you me fix a lunch date with Brockmann? Thank you. - To the Vista, please. - With pleasure. Have you ever been there? They serve the world's best poussin. Poussin? - A small poulet. - Poulet? That's a chicken. Delicious. If I were you I wouldn't eat any more poulets or we'll have to get a bigger limousine. And we can't afford that. Paul, this time I've got one too. Management by crocodile? Up to the ears in mud but mouth wide open. Beautiful view... Deep in my heart I am a provincial. Here, read. What's that? Your entry into the history books. Thermoelectric generator. - Ever heard of it? - No, not really. A car loses about 30% of its combustion energy in the form of hot air. With this generator you could recover energy and lower fuel consumption. That's the most promising development I've ever seen at Walser. It'll bring in millions and revolutionise the automobile industry. If it works. It's not even in the beta phase. That'll happen faster than you think. You don't know how fast I think. If we restructure cleverly and aim for the world market for thermoelectric generators, that'd be a sustainable solution for Walser, safe and socially acceptable. A massive liquidity squeeze is looming. I'm not permitting any new projects if we're not saving somewhere. We'll use management bonuses for funding. That'll be your invention. If the project saves the company, you'll be the hero. The whole world will talk about it. You're a tough bastard. ?Win now. Fight later. To my generator. What about our lunch? Oh. - Hello? Waiter! - Or is your wife playing coy? Jeanne... I need your help. I need an escort. Yes, yes, I know. Please! Only one more evening. Good. ?As long as a person renders his service gladly and beyond reason and serves his lord with blind allegiance his service is perfect. Throw everything away and immerse yourself in service. That is the highest form. One day a young lion got caught in my fence and its paw was trapped. It was stuck and I panicked. Remember? I wanted to free it and approached it cautiously, but it tore my jacket with its paw. I had thrown it over its head to blind it so that it'd quiet down a bit. I lifted the fence a few centimetres. The lion roared with pain but managed to free itself. So then I suddenly stood face to face with a roaring, injured predator. When injured, they're at their most dangerous. You're damn right. Coffee? Yes, please. Cathy! Coffee! Do you hunt too? My father was a passionate hunter. Always that understatement. He's an amazing shot. We have to go pheasant hunting. He doesn't shoot to kill. Oh, no desire to kill? Killing doesn't interest me. I'm fascinated by precision. Who of you plays? What would you like to hear? - Surprise us. - I'm happy to. Come on... Please! How can you leave this man, Jeanne? What was that about? You dance as well as you used to. Did you do that on purpose? Is this some kind of perverse revenge? No, that's not true. You dance even better. They'll laugh about us. Let them laugh! Are you listening to what I'm saying? May I come in? Alex. We're in the middle of divorce. You may be, I'm not. You'll realise it some day. I hope it's not too late then! It's good. - Good morning. - Good morning. What are they doing? Didn't you order this? External consultants are downloading all the data. Yes? Say, those consultants. I thought Brockmann was listening to you? And? Very good. Thanks. And? How far are you? We're on it. When will you have a prototype? I don't know - in two or three months. Grischa's still perfecting the combination. What does that mean? Just let us do our work, okay? Rainer. I stuck my neck out very far for you. Okay, give us one month, the tests won't be completed by then but... On the 31st we'll do a test bench demonstration, with all the works. Here we see how much energy our generator recovers from the hot air. If this value's higher than 11%, Walser's back in shape. I decide when Walser's back in shape. But don't get distracted. I'm curious. Shit. The data aren't getting through. I've got to set up everything again. Brockmann, hello... Can I book a table? In ten minutes? Yes, thank you. Take it in stride. Sorry about that. I knew you could be counted upon. Congratulations. Very good. Who is it? Alex. Is Th?o here? I've been trying to tell you for weeks. Th?o? Please. Talk to me. You said you needed time to yourself. That wasn't all I said. You escort me to a dinner. You said you needed help. As if you could help me. Th?o! Just send me those divorce papers. It's ok. At 10 o'clock there's the conference call with Germany and the team meeting's right after that. And fix a date with Wolfbach real estates. I want to sell my apartment. What? - But it's... - they know the property. Okay. - The forest calls! - Beg your pardon? We have to celebrate our invention. The strategy meeting's about to start. Mrs Walter! We have a few changes in schedule. A small contest, just the two of us. Good, isn't it? Yes. Thank you. You'll taste blood again, I swear! Nice to see you, Antoine. Let's go! One-nil. Good hunting! Shit! Blank cartridges. You said you didn't want to kill. Did I say that? Just blank cartridges! Alex? I've got a summary of the team meeting. Our budget's in deficit. Thank you. I'll have a look at it. What about the key figures for the generator? Second folder. Management'll get it tomorrow. What's this? A draft or something? Five seconds - two point mistakes here! - Luckily in the text. - But the figures are okay. Yes, the figures are okay. Don't you want to go home? Soon. You care about the generator, don't you? It's our future. What's this? It's an interesting study, don't you think? You lied to me. You never intended to build this generator. I wouldn't put it like that. You want to sell the entire catalyst division? Everything that makes up Walser? We have to examine all alternatives, that's how it's done. That's not an alternative, that's Walser's death. My strategy is sustainable and human. With your strategy we'll die. That's not true! The only thing in my strategy that doesn't suit you is the profits. What kind of a chief financial officer are you? Do you really mind that they want to earn more? I don't like the price we're paying for this. This, ladies and gentlemen, is Brain Drive! Walser's future. We'll sell the entire catalyst production and enter into the battery market. Is that a joke? Does Walser know about your plans? I've come here to turn this company into a market leader. Of course Walser knows. And, pardon me... what about the generator? Your invention is useless because you kids are far too slow! If we buy Europe's three top companies and bring them together under the name of Walser, we'll be market leaders right away. Not in fifteen years. Tell the colleagues how you intend to fund this. By going public. Up to now I thought you were clever. But going public with a long-established company prior to a drastic change doesn't make any sense. Someone of your stature should show more imagination, don't you think? I'm completely against it. Walser has the opportunity to increase growth and market shares on its own. But we need time for that. Time that going public doesn't permit. Time, time! You're boring me, Maier. The time of Swiss slowness is over. Is that clear? Do you know how many jobs your plan would destroy? How stupid do you think I am? Of course I do. I want your team to calculate the takeovers. Prepare the key figures for the Board of Directors. Ah, Th?o! Hi! What are you doing here? - You said we are going to the movies. - Oh. What's this strange stuff? Nothing. It's a present. Sorry, I'm not quite ready yet. Easy. I can wait. - Shall I check what's on? - Mh-mh. What do you fancy? Choose something. Action or comedy? Sorry. This doesn?t work. I'm sorry, we've got to postpone this. Really? My mind's occupied. But you know what? Sandra? No time. I wasn't allowed to say anything. What are you typing? My dismissal? Is that the new style in here? To deceive your own boss? What should I have done? Can I trust you? Of course. Close the door. I need something we can use against Brockmann. Oh dear. Hey, are you going to help me? Just have to text Noah something... Do you see how beautiful it is here? I'm not blind. You're totally addicted to your phone. You're one to talk! You're no better. Yes? What do you mean the factor's wrong? Didn't he check the plausibility? Why are you asking me? I don't know! Then he has to calculate it again. What? Yes, I'm camping. With my son. A tent peg's missing. - Well, so look for it! - Yeah, yeah. Hey, come here. Yes. That's not for you. Here! Go away! Go away, that's not for you! Go! Damn you, go! Hey, leave these creatures in peace! - Are you nuts? - It has no manners! Neither have you! And what about you? At least I'm not abusing animals. Looks done. Is it good? What about the preparations for Brain Drive? We still need a few key figures. The board meeting's next week. Do you know what this takeover means? It's not possible within this time frame. How, not possible? Not possible! You just need to work more. Do you want to see my overtime list? Work more, are you serious? You go camping and... - That's none of our business. - What... He's not the problem. Do you know what? If it's too much for anyone, they can go. There's the door. There's a couple that is interested in your apartment. I'll tell the agent she should manage that, okay? Yes, do that. Have you found something? That's not from me. Where have you got this from? It took place two years ago. Careless decisions, lousy work climate, even suspected fraud. The authors conclude that he gravely damaged the company. Where did you get this from? I can't tell you that. Why were there no consequences? Apparently there was a deal. ?The samurai who appears to be despondent and worried, no matter what the situation, is a failure... He is useless if he is not highly motivated and ready to strive for victory by any means. Inventiveness in peaceful times is the military preparation for war... For with the right allies an overpowering opponent can be defeated. Mr Maier, what's up, are we in a spy movie now? - I need to talk to you. - What about? In the next board meeting, Mr Brockmann will present a new strategy for Walser. Which you'll support, I hope. I was told you were on board. I'm absolutely against a strategy that jeopardises the company. Mr Brockmann says the same about your plans. Because he's got no clue about this business! We've got plenty of staying power. With good people and innovation we can continue what your grandfather started. I have gathered some information about Mr Brockmann. I hold you in high esteem, Maier... So see to it that the Board of Directors says no. Aren't you afraid when you see how fast the world is changing? Humanism has always been old-fashioned. Going public is risky. We all know that. It entails a lot of additional work and Walser'll be increasingly nonautonomous. Do we want that? Do we really want that? All in favour raise your hand. So it's been decided, four votes against three in favour of going public. Congratulations. Wonderful decision. We can count on you, can't we? Yes. Yes. Sure. Was that your doing? Do you think I'm as stupid as that? I know about your little conspiracy. But my vanity's not the issue. You won't destroy this company. I want the same as you do. I want this company to have a future. I can't manage this if you oppose me. ?A man who is well versed will soon fall prey to self-delusion; he is pleased to be called a capable man and boasts of being ahead of his time. Blinded by the illusion that noone could surpass him. Such behaviour is bound to call forth the wrath of heaven. You all know that Mr Brockmann and I have had our differences. But the Board of Directors has decided and I fully stand behind it. We now need to be professional and make no mistakes. Is that clear? Okay, so let's start. Black team, you prepare the stock exchange prospectus. Assessment of potential, market analysis, expected sales, and so on. Red team, you take care of the anchor investors. Our goal is that three major investors agree to provide capital. Concentrate on HGK Invest. If we get them, the others will follow. Okay. To work! Selling the catalyst division will bring the company the required 250 million, which is enough to buy Brain Drive. Here are our estimates: We're assuming that we'll secure the majority of Brain Drive with 200 million. Fine. I'm happy to hear that. And? We have the second anchor investor. And if we win over HGK Invest tomorrow then you owe me a hunting trip with live ammunition. I'm proud of you, Maier! Boys! That's the list for Canada. - You said it was practically certain. - Th?o... - You said I had talent. - That's true. So why aren't you taking me with you? There are a few who are more advanced. But that's not true at all. I'm the best scorer in my age group. Yes. You're incredibly exact. Your technique's improving. But that's not everything. This is a team sport. You need to learn to think as a team and not only for yourself. Hey, everything's still possible. Start an apprenticeship. Take your time. I don't want to start an apprenticeship, I want to play hockey. Come. We can discuss this at home. At home? You're not my father! I can assure you, in this difficult market environment I'd never support going public if there weren't adequate substance and potential for the future. Haven't you rated Brain Drive far too high? The market environment will drastically change in the next few years. Still, we think your assessment of potential is very optimistic. Maybe your people should learn from our consultants. We've calculated conservatively. Your figures say something else. Just a moment. A second please... You're... you're right... There's a wrong decimal point. Now don't shit yourself. They're on board, that's all that counts. Everything was perfect. - It was just a typing error. - Stop brooding, you're depressing me. Ground floor This apartment's perfect for a family. The bedrooms are upstairs. Then a large living room with an open kitchen. Steamer and induction cooker, Dad? of course. Very durable materials. The conservatory can be heated with floor heating. Who are you? I'm sorry, I was told nobody was in. Beautiful apartment! Where are you moving? Nowhere. We're not moving anywhere. Nowhere! Move to the arse end of nowhere! Page 5. - Shit! - Yes. I want to know who prepared these figures, who checked everything through and who approved it all. Is that clear? Have you never made a mistake? Anyone making mistakes here is in the wrong place! - Alexander... - What? They're expecting you. Yes? Did you do this on purpose? Sit down. Couldn't you bear that I outdid you? What are you talking about? HKG Invest has withdrawn. What? After the two other investors heard that HKG had withdrawn... - But they can't... - Let me finish! They withdrew too. We have to stop our going public. That can't be. You sabotaged me from the start. That's not true! You couldn't bear that I had a better idea. They didn't withdraw because of me, the project was simply overreaching. That lousy performance in Frankfurt! Anyone would run away seeing that. They consented! Who knows, maybe you helped it along? Some information here, some rumours there. - I'd never want to harm the company! - Silence! This was anything but a great achievement, Maier. You will now clean up this mess and fetch the most for us owners. You want to sell? Do you see any other solution? Rabea. Do you know anyone who can hack computers? What? We have to find out why HKG Invest withdrew. But that's not important anymore. We have to prove that it's not due to our mistake. Of course our mistake wasn't the reason. - Alex. - Maybe your boyfriend has a contact - whom he can ask. - Listen, Alex, - something like that can happen. - No! Something like that doesn't simply happen. Brockmann's driven us into the ground, I'll prove it. Will you help me or not? I'm out. I'm quitting. Shall I take you home? Hey, Th?o, what's up? - Hi dad. - I tried to phone you. Will you go to the movies with me? The new Spiderman's out... I've got an exam tomorrow. Come on, you don't study anyway. I just want to chill with you. I think I should go in. Will you come? Let him be. I want to go to the movies with him. But he apparently doesn't. ?With a foolish mother in the family, the relationship between father and son may deteriorate. Go away! - Yamamoto Tsunetomo. - What's does that mean? You'll never understand. ?From a man of ordinary mind cannot be expected to great things. Only if he puts himself into an almost insane and desperate state, far beyond reason and self-interest, can he achieve such things. That's correct! I've found it! I have to talk with Mr Walser. He's occupied. Can I give him a message? It won't take long... Walser? But I said no! I went through everything. Walser still has a chance. Look! But you know that's not true. If we don't sell now, we're stupid. My team's calculations were correct! It was only a stupid typing error, everything else was right. I... I don't want to know where the mistake happened. The mistake, the mistake, do you know the real mistake? That you got Brockmann. HKG Invest simply calculated and saw that Brockmann's strategy doesn't work. If we stick to the plan, Walser still has a chance. I thinks it's best you go home now. ?After the failed going public of the Swiss automotive supplier Walser, the company's future is uncertain. According to well-informed sources there are takeover negotiations with the major Asian company Farubeni. Union representatives fear the loss of hundreds of jobs. Hans Werner Brockmann, Walser's CEO, emphasises that this step could not be avoided. The company had difficulties due to inadequate financial management. Bushido, the way of the warrior, is found in death. If you're confronted with two alternatives, life and death, you should not hesitate to choose death. That's nothing difficult. You only need to be highly determined to pursue your goal. Are you proud of yourself? As long as someone chooses death, his death is free from disgrace. Even if others may call it senseless or insane. What are you up to? Coward. I'll destroy you. Could you do me a favour? I booked a table at the Vista, but I can't go. Could you go instead? - My treat. - I don't fit in there. You go in, sit down and order your favourite dish. I can't accept this. So take it as payment for an errand. Then take this letter to my ex-wife. Just enjoy it. It'll give me pleasure. Thank you. ?A samurai has to pledge loyalty to his lord. But what does he do if the lord errs? Does he have to share his mistakes? No. He can protest. But this protest will cost him his life. Hans Werner Brockmann is a lousy manager. Nothing's good enough for him, and the pressure he's exerted is inhuman. I sincerely hope that what I'm doing now will warn the world against this man. He's driven me to suicide. I hope that my action will ensure that I'll remain his only victim. - Seriously? - He shot himself. Do you seriously believe I drove him to suicide? It doesn't matter what I believe. Mr Maier's suicide came as a complete surprise to me and to us all. I'm speechless. I have many questions and I'll probably never get any answers. In management positions no holds are barred. Everyone is responsible for themselves, needs to be able to assess his capabilities realistically. All of us have to learn how to cope with defeat. Some manage that better than others. In the past days I was faced with accusations which I have to protest strongly. Neither with words nor deeds have I made myself guilty. I, ehm... of course I had to point out things that didn't work well. But that always happened - I emphasise, always - with the greatest respect. Nevertheless: I've decided, personally, out of respect for the family of the deceased and to prevent further damage to Walser, that I'll step down as CEO with immediate effect. Thank you. My condolences. A film by Sabine Boss
