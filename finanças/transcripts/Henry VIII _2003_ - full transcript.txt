(â™ª classical) Bless this bed, and those that lie in it, and let it yield the son that England desires. Amen. God bless her Majesty. You don't think this wedding came too soon, Cromwell? That we should have waited? No. Once the late queen's guilt was established, it was the best thing you could do. Her guilt? You managed to say the word without blushing. It was proven by two courts, your Grace. It was ruled by two courts. There was never any proof. Especially on the charge of incest... that was always too much. She divided your country. And you don't? The dissolution of the monasteries will refill the treasury. And the violence committed in my name? Fully justified, your Grace. Is it? Then how come I can no longer sleep? Oh, thank you, Mr. Aske. Thank you. You must do something, Mr. Aske! The people will listen to you. The monastery at York is still burning tonight. Reports are reaching me from all over the country of monks burned alive, of priests, good men... Slaughtered. Atrocities committed, not by evil barbarians from some distant land, but by our king for his new church... A church he dared dub, "the Church of England." And I stand here, a proud Englishman, and I'll tell you what the English Church is, and that is the Catholic Church, the one true Church of Rome. A church for which, I don't know about you but for which I am prepared to die. So, go home, go home, go home, and rouse everyone you know to march against a king... ...who is hellbent on ruining this God-fearing land! What's the matter, my lord? Won't you come back to bed? I would, if I thought I could sleep... ...but I can't. I would just lie there thinking. Is there nothing I can do? Thank you, no. I have people whose job it is to help me. Yes, but which of them can you trust? Hmm. You should surround yourself with people who have your best interests at heart. Like who? Your family. Wife. Daughters. My eldest daughter wishes me dead. That's not true. I have spent time with Mary, and she is anxious to see you. Be careful, Jane. Those words were put in her mouth by the Spanish Ambassador. That is a trap. You feel hot. Hmm? Hot. Promise me you will speak to your physician tomorrow. If you promise me you will make peace with the Lady Mary. Jane. If I could persuade her to come to court, and agree to your conditions? She will never agree. She thinks I murdered her mother. But if I could persuade her... Well, if you could do that... If you could fill the treasury without spilling blood, if you could heal my rift with the Vatican, yet reform the Catholic Church, if you could strengthen my armies, yet guarantee peace... If you could do all of that, then perhaps you would make me happy. But you can't. And anyway... ...there's nothing compared to the one thing you can give me... A son. Give me a son. May God bless you and protect you. May God bless you and protect you. May God bless you and protect you. May God bless you and protect you. May God bless you, Robert, and protect you. Amen. How many did you say? 20,000 and growing. Oh, good God. They're calling it the "Pilgrimage of Grace." With the king's army in France, he's vulnerable. I must warn him. I'll give you a letter. Make sure he gets it. He won't like it when he sees who it's from, but maybe it'll restore our friendship! God bless you! We march on London! Robert Aske. Who, my lord? Aske. A former lieutenant of mine, and a loyal soldier. What about him, your Grace? Well, it appears that he is raising troops against me. What? In protest of the dissolution of the monasteries. Your Grace... Now, the idea was to increase my popularity, and put an end to papist corruption. Instead, my people raise armies against me! Then I suggest we send an army to... What army? They left York with 20,000 men! By the time they get to London, they'll be twice, maybe three times that amount! What have you done? Leave us. Send a messenger. Tell him... the king remembers him well, and wishes to avoid any conflict with a... ...an old comrade. And we would see him here... in person. But, your Grace... Just do it, man. I'll take care of the rest. I'll tell you, that Cromwell lately does me more harm than good. There's something I have to tell you. I went to see my physician, as you said. When I told him the symptoms, he was concerned. What did he say? Well... ...he took my blood and measured my pulse. And? I do have a condition... ...but it is not the plague. You're... ? Oh, Jane. Jane, this is a sign from God! Oh! Robert Aske, your Grace. Thank you for agreeing to see me. The last thing I want is a former comrade taking up arms against me. Particularly when the odds are so against you. Hmm. Yes. Some wine? I've come to talk, not drink. Well, then talk. What are your demands? First, that you stop immediately the slaughter of innocent priests and friars in your suppression of the monasteries. I will... just as soon as they put to an end their corruption and decadence. They are innocent for the most part, as you well know. Be mindful of your tone. I am your king. Only as long as I allow you to live... ...and stay on the throne. And your second demand? That you return all the money and valuables that you have stolen from the churches. I need to fill the treasury somehow. How can I protect a country if I don't have the money? Stop giving the existing wealth to corrupt nobles, and be more judicious in your choice of wars. It's a fine day when a simple lieutenant lectures the king on foreign policy. And a still finer day when a simple lieutenant... ...is in charge of 50,000 men. And your third demand? That you punish those responsible... ...for these abominations. You do realise I could have you executed on the strength of what I've heard here alone? Yes. I also realise that you have no choice but to comply. And if I do... ...if I do... ...do I have your word you'll take your followers back to York... ...and never step outside the city gates again? You have my word. Right. Then I agree to all three demands. Huh? No, my lord. My lord, no! And you, Robert... You cheeky sod! I may call you Robert? Yes. I'd like to invite you stay at my palace for two or three days. Your Highness is most kind, but... We fought together at Tournai, if memory serves. Well, a few of us get together every year and celebrate the victory. I'd like you to come. I really must be returning... It's an invitation... ...from the king, Robert. You say "yes." Yes. Excellent. Excellent. Yes! I'll tell you, the boxing of the ears I can cope with... the taunts and jests, too. But to be humiliated like this... And in front of Aske... It's just too much. Perhaps we've overdone it, Cranmer. Perhaps... we're moving too quickly. No. Master Secretary, have faith. We are quietly, steadily changing this country for the better. Throughout Europe, the word is spreading. In Germany, the Protestants already have the majority. I know, but sometimes I think I should leave the struggle to others, and concentrate on giving the king what he wants. No, Thomas. You have your beliefs and your conscience, and what is a man without those? Alive, my lord. Alive. Remember how they ran, those French knights? They no more wanted to fight than to have one single hair on their head disturbed! Then, Sir Francis here... ...led his men 'round from the east. Now, I had no other choice. If I had ordered him to come around from the west, he would've never have seen the enemy! He'd have... ...rode straight past them. But the real turning point in the battle was... ...was dear Robert here, when he led his troops on a fearless raid straight through the middle of the sleeping enemy with insane courage and ruthless determination, which I have had... ...the misfortune to experience myself these last few days. But we're friends now, aren't we? We're friends. Friends! Sing! Someone sing. I'm pleased you stayed, Robert. So am I, my lord. I only wish my followers had been here to see it. They'd have seen a king to be proud of. Goodnight. Goodnight, my lord. Sleep well. Sleep well. Good news... The heartbeat's strong. The head is facing the right way. It's progressing well. And the gender? I'm afraid there's no way of establishing that. She could eat salt. Some people believe it helps, if you want a boy. You do want a boy? Yes. Can you even imagine if it is a boy? A Seymour, heir to the throne... We will be uncles to the future king. And if it isn't, her head will roll. No. No. Her head will only roll if she continues with her mission to bring back his daughter Mary to court. The Lady Mary, your Grace. Welcome, Mary. Your Grace. I believe you have something to say. I acknowledge you as queen, and your unborn child as the one true heir... ...replacing me. And I pray for you both, that it is a prince. Welcome, Mary. I am pleased to see you here. And I you, your Majesty, for I recognise that it is entirely done to you, that the king has accepted me back. For this, I shall be forever in your debt. But... what of the Church? I have heard of uprisings in York, and I fear the king will retaliate. Quite the opposite. Master Aske spent Christmas with us. The king has agreed to his every demand. I'm back! I return after a month at court, having secured our every demand. I think a hero's welcome is in order. Don't kill him. I want him alive. Make sure you take him alive. God bless his Holiness, the Pope. God bless... ...the one true Catholic Church of England. If he falls unconscious, make sure you wake him. I want his death to last a full three days. My good friend. Your Grace. It's good to have you back. I need a lion like you by my side. It is where I belong, your Highness. I pray you never send me away again. Oh, no. Come here! The queen, your Grace. Is it true what I've heard? That Robert Aske has been murdered and hung from the gates of York? The man raised an army against me. He got what he deserved. Now, if you don't mind, madam... But, Henry, you promised... Henry? Henry is a name reserved for the bedchamber. You said you would agree to his demands. I am the King of England. I don't agree to demands. And his followers and allies? What of them? They will be silenced, too. Is that it? You will just silence all the dissenters? To speak against the king is treason! Oh, my lord, don't do this. Do not hide behind words like "king" and "treason." Don't forget you're a man of flesh and blood who will one day be judged as all men of flesh and blood are. Am I imagining this? Am I now being lectured to by a woman? You are being cautioned by your wife, whose conscience will not allow her to stand by and watch as the man she loves degenerates into a monster... To hell with your conscience! You are my wife. What I want from you is sons, not opinions or meddling. Sons! Sons! Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God! Quick. Call the physicians. My lord... ...I have news from the queen. And? You have a son... A healthy son. Jane. Thank you, dearest Jane. Thank you, thank you. I gave you a son. Mm-hmm. You're not angry with me? Angry? I will show you generosity like no other woman has seen. I will carpet your rooms with flowers for the rest of your life, and I will make you the most adored, most celebrated queen in history. Jane? Jane? Please, leave us. The queen is tired. She must rest. Rest... There's too many people. My lord... No, there's too many people. She must rest. My lord... Jane... She must rest... She has a fever, my lord, and is very weak. God. This night is important. If she survives... I said save her. Do you understand? She is the Queen of England, mother of my son. Please, God. God... ...please, please, please, please. Forgive me, Jane. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to shout at you. I don't know what is becoming of me. I will make it up to you. I promise. Jane? Jane? Don't leave me. Don't go. I am your husband, your sovereign. I command you, don't go. Jane! Jane! And how's the prince? In perfect health. Then why does he cough? Because he swallowed his milk too quickly. Or because he has an infection? He doesn't have an infection. Really? You can tell the difference between the two coughs? Yes, I can. Even if your life depended on it? Before I go, your Grace, there is another matter. It has been two years since the late queen died, and we still have not agreed on a replacement. I realise you have no desire to remarry, but I would be failing you if I did not urge you to consider it. Why? The young prince's health. What about it? His nurses are worried about the plague. The prince is fine. He has his father's constitution. The plague has no respect for constitution. And there would be less danger to the prince from other sources, if he had brothers. I will not marry again. Besides, I am aware that you've been making enquiries to various princesses in Europe, and I was refused, hmm? I have found one who is willing. Oh, some Protestant heretic, no doubt, to serve your own ends. She is a Protestant, I admit. Ah! The Duke of Cleves's daughter. Well, I'm not interested. Your Grace... since your excommunication, France has allied with the emperor. England needs the Germans. Hmm. So, what's she like? Our ambassador has confirmed her appearance was most pleasing. Most pleasing? Most pleasing, your Grace. And she's German... Nice flaxen hair and at least... Actually, Lady Anne is dark... Dark? ...but still, a renowned beauty. Hmm. Well, send the court painter. But that will delay matters. Time is not on our side. I will not commit to someone without proof of beauty. I mean, in the name of God, I've got to sleep with her. Yes, your Grace. Send the painter Holbein, and that's as far as I go, hmm? Corpus Christi. Amen. Corpus Christi. Amen. Corpus Christi. Amen. Corpus Christi. Corpus Christi. Amen. It's painful to watch. The king is half the man he was in spirit and twice the man he was in size. Cromwell and Cranmer push him this way and the next, to suit their own ends. I tell you, Bishop Gardiner, it's a sorry England you return to. And the latest is this Protestant German princess... Which, quite apart from the heresy, leaves England exposed politically. It is our duty as Catholics to put up a rival. Who? He's been rejected by three French princesses already. What about Marie de Guise? Already contracted. The Duchess of Milan? She said she could only marry him if she had two heads so he could dispose of one at his pleasure. Why rush to promote some stranger when we have our own clan? I've had one daughter murdered by the king. I've done my share. What about my late brother's girl? Who, little Catherine? She was always a pretty little thing. She's barely 15. Is that too young? Shame on you, Thomas. She's no more than a child. Hmm. Not bad. The painter, Master Holbein, was certainly favourably impressed. And not just because you instructed him to be? And not because you whispered the political significance of this choice in his ear? Absolutely not, my lord. Well, she has full lips and a rising bosom, which I like. When can we meet her? Just as soon as the lawyers have finished with the contract. What lawyers? The princess, it seems, has been unusually cautious. Well, German lawyers... I don't like the sound of that. There's no need for concern. I have it all under control. And all being well, the princess shall soon set sail for England. Good. Let me know when she does and we'll meet her on the way. Give her a surprise. Hmm. Go on. Give me a plum. Two plums. Yeah. Mmm. Nice and ripe. So... ...the king marries whom he's told to? Congratulations, Cromwell... A personal victory! Only if the union serves the kingdom. Even the late Cardinal Wolsey was never so close he could instruct our king with whom he should sleep. And nor do I. His Majesty's gone to Rochester to inspect her for himself when she arrives, but with your prayer I'm sure for the safety of this country that he will be satisfied. We do not pray, Cromwell, that England falls into the hands of heretics. Protestant and Catholic, my lord bishop... We are brothers in Christian Church. I tell you, Cromwell is powerful enough. If the king likes the match, we might as well cut our throats now. Our luck can change yet. Don't forget, all this rests on a simple portrait. Aye, but one by Master Holbein, whose talent is famed throughout Europe. Yes, but you know these artistic types... unreliable. She-She's a monster, Thomas. She looks like a horse. No, worse... for I would gladly ride a horse. Then break the engagement. I can't, thanks to Cromwell. Henry, King of England, trapped by German lawyers. I have the wedding night to consider. Good God, can you imagine? She can't be that bad. Oh, Thomas, she has an arse as big as Normandy and evil smells about herself. There must be a solution. Well, if you could find a solution, Thomas, I would be forever in your debt. Still no sign of the king? Ah, Cromwell. What brings you at this time? Just wondering, my lord, when you were thinking of going to bed? When I'm tired. Do I look tired? No, of course not. Well, what's the problem? It's just... ...this is your wedding night. Yes? So, I thought his Majesty might not be going to bed to sleep. Why? What else should I be doing? Your Majesty. I hope I'm not mistaken, Cromwell... I hope you are not telling your sovereign when or with whom he should lie. Of course not... Shut up. You dare call me to bed with this woman, to humiliate me. No, my lord. Not only will I never sleep with her, I will never touch her, shake hands with her, stand within a farmer's mile downwind of her. Now, if you want to do something useful, find a way out of this contract, or within a month, your flesh will be feeding worms on Tower Hill. Goodness, your Grace, what brings you here at this time? The niece we spoke about... My late brother's daughter? Catherine? Yes. Is she here? Well, of course she's here. I need to see her. Now? She'll be sleeping. Then we must wake her. My lord, wait! This is her room. Catherine! Oh, quick Francis, hide! Catherine? Who is it? It's Uncle Thomas. Come to the door. What time is it? Catherine! Have you no manners? Curtsy to the duke. Come into the light where I can see you. Does she bleed yet? Yes. Tell me, Catherine, are you interested in bringing great glory to your family, and securing incalculable wealth and power for yourself? Yes, of course I am, but how would I... Don't worry about that. Just give me your word you will do everything I say, and follow my every instruction to the letter. Do you understand? Yes. Good. Very good. And? Nothing, sir. After three months searching, you have found no irregularities in the contract, no contradictions that we can exploit? None. It seems the queen was a snow white virgin until she reached our shores. And remains one still, despite having been married for five months. It seems the Catholics will have the last laugh after all. So, we are to dissolve the marriage? Yes... ...and watch powerlessly as the German lawyers hit us with every penalty clause they've got. Does the king know? Not yet. What? I beg you, give me a chance to remedy the situation... Remedy what, man? They're signed and sealed! It was the artist Holbein's fault. If he had not painted... No, it was your fault! You have allowed them to make a fool of me. I never wanted this marriage. I never even wanted to meet Anne of Cleves! You said it was important! You have made a fool of me! Get out. Get out! The king does not need your useless remedies or your wives that bring lawyers to rape me. Get out! Get out! And you... I'll find a fate for you when I can bring myself to entertain you in my thoughts. Get out of my sight. Get out! Sir, we have a warrant for your arrest, signed by the king. I die the king's true servant. God save the king. I hear the king has asked for a novice executioner. An act of mercy. Had it been me, the wretch would have burned. Good God, how old are you? 16, my Lord. Is this your first time? Yes, sir, but I've been practising all night. Right. Do the best you can. That's all I ask. This is it, Gardiner. This is our moment. The king is so angry, we can use this to finish off the rest of the Protestant ringleaders. Don't be nervous. Ooh! Robert Burns... ...by the order of his Majesty, Henry, King of England, I sentence you to death. Do you renounce your Protestant faith? No! Burn him! You die a heretic and a sinner! I die a child of Christ! Burn him! Let him be an example to all those who wish to forsake the Catholic Church. Oh, God, save me! Jesus Christ, receive me! Robert Burns was a heretic, a disciple of Luther. He deserved to die. Perhaps, but is it wise to burn him like that, and in full view of his supporters? People die in this kingdom when I say so. Your Majesty, I was just concerned... Save your concerns and worry about yourself. I know you have a wife in secret. Is that fine conduct for a Catholic archbishop? Is it, Gardiner? Go away! Go away! Your Grace... I just need a signature. It's the last one I sign, Gardiner. Can't you see I'm busy here? How did he find that card? I thought I was the only man allowed to have four queens. Your Grace? Thomas... another man I've made grotesquely rich. I hope your manners are better than this lot and you will lose some of it back to me. Delighted as always, your Grace. Yes. Your Grace may remember I mentioned I'd brought my niece Catherine to court? What? My late brother's daughter. Oh, yes, yes. She's here now. May I present her? Yes. Your Majesty. Come here. What did you say your name was again? Catherine, your Grace. Catherine Howard. Let me have a closer look. Do you play, Catherine? I understand the rules, your Grace, but do not play. Cards are not proper entertainment for ladies. And what is proper entertainment for ladies? Needlework, prayer and painting. Quite right. Quite right. I'll take two. No, your Majesty. Take three. Sir Nicholas changed two, which means he's looking for hearts, Sir Francis wanted just one, which means he's looking for a pair, and the player sitting west... Thomas Culpeper. ...looks so glum, he wishes to fold. You should change three, to give you a chance of three of a kind. My lord... I'll take three. My God, she's beautiful. Beautiful, Thomas. Do you think she would ever have me? Have you? His Majesty forgets, he is the king and can have whoever he wants. Of course, but I mean, willingly? Do you think that something so pure, so perfect, could ever actually grow to love me? She has often spoken to me of her attraction for his Majesty. Really? Yes. And how unlucky he's been and how she would like to serve him as a wife and mother to his children. Really? She really said that? She did. Then she is a rose, Thomas... A rose without a thorn. Lady Catherine, your Majesty. Catherine. It's all right. You may all leave us now. If you wouldn't mind, Norfolk? Catherine, I wish to ask you something. God, my hands... they tremble. You're probably thinking that I've said these things a thousand times before, but that's not true. I never have. Your Majesty? I know I'm old and I have lost my looks. That's not true. No. It's the truth. But since I have met you, I've experienced something I never thought I had the right to feel again. Which is? Hope, Catherine. Hope that maybe I have a chance before I die, to love someone properly, to give where I have only taken, to make someone happy. I know this has come quickly, and I should give you more time to get to know me better, but I'm afraid time is against me. So, if you would allow me... Catherine... ...will you marry me? Marry me and become my queen. John, how are you? I'd like to present my sister, Mary Lascelles, who wishes to speak to you on an important matter. It's about the queen. Then speak, Mary. I'd prefer if we did it in private. Come, now. What could you possibly say about the queen that you could not say in public? God bless your Majesty! I thank you for coming to see me, Mary. I don't want to make trouble. I just thought you should know. You did the right thing. Tell the Seymour brothers I would see them. I wish your mother was still alive. If she could see you now. I also wish that she were here that she could tell you a little of what to expect tonight, and how to conduct yourself. Don't worry, Great Aunt. I think I'll be all right. What does that mean? It means that I know from experience that my looks please most men. I don't know what that means, girl, and I'm not going to ask. Know this... The king is taking you as a virgin. If he suspects otherwise, all our lives are in danger. Do you understand? Yes. Whether you know or may not know about these matters in reality, as far as he's concerned, you know nothing. Yes. My God, I can hardly contain myself. Feelings I thought were dead and buried are revived at the mere sound of her name. She is a revelation. She will give me sons... Many sons. I will lie with her every night... Twice a night, three times a night. We will have an army of sons! Bless this bed and those who lie in it. Let it yield the son that England desires. My God. I have cast my eyes over some of the great treasures of this world, but none of which compare with you. And you think this Lascelles woman can be trusted? Why not? She shared a room with the queen at the dowager duchess's. She's known to share our views on religious reform. But even if it is true, fornication before marriage with this... Francis Dereham. It's a scandal, but not a crime. But it was not just fornication, was it? There was also a pre-contract to marry. Says who? There are no official documents. No. We should tread carefully. The king's love for this girl is blind, and until we find something that implicates her beyond all doubt, we should remain quiet. Thomas. Thomas, what a night! What a woman! Bring us food. Wake the cook and tell her, "The king needs a hearty lover's supper." Yes, my lord. I can hardly look you in the eye. My lord, please. I beg you, don't worry. It was just one night. It was our wedding night. It's all right. I won't tell anyone. Deny you look at me and say you do not wish that in my place was some... virile young courtier. No. Are you sure? Yes. You give me your word? Yes, my lord. You are truly the sweetest, kindest angel I have ever met. Master Culpeper, your Majesty. Show him in. I beg your pardon? I said, show him in. Poor Master Culpeper. The king keeps you very busy. This is your third trip today. Doing the king's pleasure is an honor. And the queen? What of her pleasure? I do not know what pleases the queen, but if there is anything I could do, it would be my honor, too. Why laugh, Mary? No reason, ma'am. Now, there is something that would please me, Master Culpeper, which is that you look at me when you speak to me. And you can open that box. What a beautiful necklace. And a letter from the king. Ignore the letter and bring me the necklace. Now, come closer. Closer. Now, put it on. Thank you, Master Culpeper. You may go. Your Majesty. Damn her. Is she trying to ruin us all? Don't worry, I'll put an immediate end to it. Wait, wait, wait. How are things with the king? If you refer to marital matters, the king, it seems, is barely capable. What? So not only is she not having an heir, the one thing that would keep us all safe, she's unwittingly doing everything she can to bring us all down. It's a disaster. Unless... Unless what? Unless, instead of two problems, we use one to solve the other. The king wants a son but is unable. Catherine wants her lover, who is able. Come with me. Oh, it's so kind of you to get involved, Lady Rochford. I was terrified. I thought if you found out, you'd kill me. Oh, quite the opposite. I understand better than anybody what it is to be unhappily married. I'm keen to do everything I can to help. Oh, thank you. Now be careful. I will. Fetch the queen. The entertainment's about to start. Gimme five on that one. Excellent, excellent. Two on my Bodger. Come on, Bodger. Well? I couldn't find her, my lord. What? She wasn't in her quarters. Of course she was. She said she was feeling unwell and that she would be resting all afternoon. She must be there. Try again. What? Nothing, your Grace. Look. I saw that look. Really? Nothing, your Grace. Is it always going to be like this? What? Hiding away? Meeting in secret? It's only as long as he's alive, and then we can marry and have our love in the open. Then let's hope the fat fool dies soon. A fine way to talk of your king. Believe me, I was his most loyal, most trusted servant. I would have fallen on my sword for him, until I met his wife. Until tomorrow. Goodbye. It doesn't make sense. Lady Rochford actually facilitating it? That old snake would never do anything without Norfolk's approval. And he would never jeopardise Catherine's position. Unless... ...sleeping with Culpeper would somehow help her. Either way, we have no choice. We must tell the king. But it would break his heart. Oh, for God's sake, what's the alternative? That one of his closest courtiers continues to cuckold him behind his back? Give us a bastard as future King of England? God forbid. No, there's no alternative. I'm just not sure I've the strength to do it face-to-face. No! No! No! No! No! No! Where is she? How could she do this to me? You said a young girl like you could love an old man like me. I do. I believed you. I do. I believed you. I could kill you where you stand. Please don't. Where you stand! Please. Thomas Edward Culpeper. By the power invested in me by the courts of his Majesty, I arrest you on charges of high treason. Catherine, Queen of England, I arrest you on charges of high treason! Leave her alone! Stop, you're hurting her! My Majesty! No! Please leave her! Leave us alone. No. There's no time to lose. There's a warrant for your arrest. Me? The king has discovered the truth about Culpeper and the queen. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Nothing will happen to you if you make it absolutely clear I was not involved. Listen to me. I'm the only one who can save us, but I must appear blameless. Do you understand? What is going to happen to me? They'll have my head. No, they won't. Don't worry. I'll blame it on the girl. I'll tell them you knew nothing. I promise, your Majesty, it was the girl and Lady Rochford. They're in league together. Why, Thomas? Did I not reward you enough? Yes. Yes, you did. And in return, have I not been your most loyal servant? But you knew everything that was going on. You knew it would break my heart. Am I to always be betrayed by those I love? Your Majesty, please don't do this to me. Your ambitions are greater than your love for me. That in itself is treason. Your Majesty. Wait. Please. This is it. This is it, brother Edward. This is our moment. Norfolk and the Catholic faction are finished. We will be appointed guardians to our nephew, the future king. Our influence and positions become unassailable. Perhaps now, my beloved Catherine will consent to give me her hand in marriage. How very romantic. He has a beautiful head. I hope they kill me soon, that I may join him. Good Christian people... I have been justly condemned and deserve to die. I urge you... I urge you to look upon your own lives and to amend any ungodly habits. Obey the king at all times and please pray for my wretched soul. Oh, God. I don't want to die. No, I don't want to die. I don't want to die! Please let me go! I don't want to die! I'm sorry. Please. I don't want to die. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I don't want to die. I don't want to die. The shipbuilders are waiting, your Majesty, as is your armourer, for a fitting. Well, if he thinks I'm doing that now, after taking an hour to get dressed, he's mistaken. And Lady Latimer. What does she want? She won't say, your Grace, except that it's confidential. Mmm. Mmm. Show her in. Lady Latimer. Lady Latimer. Your Majesty. You have five minutes. My brother William, your Grace, is petitioning Parliament for a divorce. I know. I've seen him. He wants me to confer the death penalty on his wife. No doubt, he thinks that a fellow cuckold will be sympathetic. I am determined to grant it. I'm impressed at your loyalty to him. No, not to him. I come to petition for her. For her? But she has betrayed your brother... Indeed. ...and humiliated him, and put shame on your family. Yes. But you would spare her life? She's done wrong. She's committed a terrible sin for which she should pay. But must it be with her life? That is the law. I appeal to you, Sir, because you are above the law. If you spare her, you give my brother the chance, in time, to forgive her. So you would have your brother show compassion to this adulteress? And so guarantee his soul at the time of reckoning. After all, do we not most please God when we pardon those that have wronged us? Lord Parr is a fortunate man to have someone watch over him so. It is what any good sister would do. Is it? With no thought of personal gain. My brother's happiness is my personal gain. Well said. She has been married twice before, you know, and to men much older than herself. Indeed, your Grace, and is known throughout the court for her intelligence, modesty and her virtue. And don't forget beauty. It is not right for a beautiful woman such as you not to have a husband. Your Majesty. Or an ailing man, who is close to death, not to have a companion. Indeed. And I hope his Majesty soon finds somebody suitable. Humph. What about you, Lady Latimer? You are a good woman. Alas, I am promised elsewhere. May I ask to whom? Of course, the Seymours. Never one to miss a good opportunity. I must leave with heavy heart... ...and dream about what might have been... ...if there was, for once, no Seymours in my world. Think, baby brother, think. Lady Latimer is undeniably an advantageous match right now, but just think how much more advantageous she'd be as the king's widow. No. With all the land and revenue she'd bring as the widow. And when will that be? A year. Two at the most. His heart is weak, his leg is infected. He'll soon be dead. He wants a companion for the last few months of his life. Let him have her. God knows, he won't be able to sully her. You know, Edward, of the two of us, I always thought I was the more ambitious. I was wrong. Come... swallow your medicine. Take a nice foreign posting somewhere, bide your time. Wait for news from your big brother that the king is dead. Elizabeth has agreed to come? She's on her way. Mary, too? Yes, and Mary, too. Thank you, Catherine. Thank you. You know, this will be the first time we've been all together. I have so much planned. We shall play cards. Mary is a sharp player, that much I know, and she has a great fondness for young Edward. We shall play music. Elizabeth has a love for music. And tomorrow, we shall ride out, all of us together. I'll fetch your shawl. It is me... Henry. Henry. Have we not been happy these past 15 years? Yes. Your Majesty. I'm sorry I hurt you. You are truly the sweetest, kindest angel I ever met. It is a sign from God. What is this? Death warrants, your Grace. It is for the Duke of Norfolk, your Grace. It is time. It's time. Edward, is that you? Yes, Father, I'm here. Edward, I am dying. By tonight, you will be king. Your sisters, Mary and Elizabeth... Honor and protect them always. Yes, Father. The country is on the threshold of civil war. You have but a faint grip on the crown. Your enemies hide in the shadows. I am ready, Father. Are you? Then tell me, what is the most important thing to do to be a successful king? Continue the reforms. Suppress the Papists. Expand our territories in France. Increase the taxes on the nobles... And? And... ...have a son. That is the most important thing I can do. No. No. To be successful as king, first you must be successful as a man. Listen to your heart, Edward. For the voice of your conscience is the voice of God. Do you die in the faith of Christ? He squeezed my hand. He gave an answer. The king died in the faith of Christ. The Duke of Norfolk escaped death. In time, he was released from the Tower, given a full pardon and regained all his lands and power. Edward became King Edward VI, but his health was frail. He died of consumption, aged 15. Edward Seymour, Lord Protected of England... He ruled by proxy until 1551, when he was imprisoned in the Tower and beheaded. Thomas Seymour did finally marry Catherine Parr, but broke her heart when he attempted to seduce the 14-year-old Princess Elizabeth. He was executed for treason in 1549. Bloody Mary came to the throne in 1553. She burned hundreds of Protestants as heretics and died embittered and unloved in 1558. Anne of Cleves outlived all the wives. Widely liked and respected, she was buried rich and popular, with full honours. Thomas Cranmer continued to lay the foundations for the Church of England, only to be arrested for treason on the orders of Mary I, and burned as a heretic. And what of Henry? After a lifelong struggle to give England an heir, his glorious successor was not a son, but a daughter. Elizabeth I, daughter of Henry and Anne Boleyn, came to the throne in 1558 and ruled England for 45 years.
