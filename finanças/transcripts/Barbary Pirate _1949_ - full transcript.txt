Gentlemen, gentlemen. Order, please. Mr. Jefferson, as vice president, what is your opinion? President Adams, I believe we have no choice. True, our navy is too small to protect every vessel, but we have paid tribute long enough. Now we must fight Yusef and his Barbary Pirates. You're wrong, Mr. Jefferson. What do you mean, Mr. Sharpe? As an expert on Mediterranean affairs, I know these Tripolitanians well. They're like children. They must be treated gently. Seems to me Yusef is rather a dangerous child. Oh, come, come. Let's not manufacture an incident. The sinking of the Catherine was purely accidental. And the Brady, the Concord, the Boston Queen, the Patrick Henry? Were those all accidents, too? The Barbary Pirate is a necessary hazard to shipping. Like reefs and storms. Even France and England pay tribute to Yusef. He's right, Jefferson. When we convoy our ships, the pirates know and never attack. Precisely. They attack only unprotected ships carrying the richest cargos. So it seems for the moment that we are helpless. Gentlemen, I have devoted my life to making this country free. I do not propose to concede that she is helpless. Excuse me, sir, now. Six ships. Your Britisher, a Dane, three Portuguese and now an American. All in one month. You have surpassed my five. I have been fortunate, your majesty. Exactly. Too fortunate. Soon there will be no more ships. Then who will pay my tribute? Your majesty, I demand an immediate audience... Ah, Mr. Cathcart. I heard that America was still a land of savages. - Your majesty... - Let him come in. Well, Mr. Cathcart. On behalf of the government of the United States, I protest the unwarranted attack on the brig Catherine. Brig? I took no brig. Your majesty knows very well that your admiral has sunk an American ship and imprisoned her captain and crew in violation of our treaty. Murad Reis, you have deceived me. I, your majesty? You. You did not tell me that this brig belonged to our good friends, the Americans. But, your majesty... Uh, I did not know, your majesty. It was too foggy to see the colors. In the future, be more careful. Mr. Cathcart, inform your government that Yusef deeply regrets the sinking of the brig Catherine. The president of the United States demands the release of Captain Witherspoon and his crew. Demands? But it is so unnecessary. He only has to ask. Oh, Captain Witherspoon will be released? Immediately. Release him. Thanks, your majesty. Not at all, captain. Your majesty. You're free. You may go. Seize him. The prisoner has escaped. But, your majesty, what are you... Silence. Captain Witherspoon was my prisoner. He has obviously left his cell. The penalty for attempting to escape is death. But, your majesty, he didn't. Have him killed. But this is insane. Don't you realize my government is paying tribute? It's inconceivable that any civilized... Throw him in chains. Heh, heh, heh. He is guilty of helping a prisoner to escape. Mr. Cathcart, from now on, it is I who shall make the demands and the president of the United States who will obey them. Major Blake, I'm going to be quite plain. - I can give you no official support. - Yes, sir. Once you leave these United States, you will be completely on your own. - If you fail... - I understand, sir. There's a ship sailing for Constantinople in two weeks, the Salem Sta and she will travel without escort. Among the captain's personal effects will be political presents from this nation to the sultan of Turkey. A decoy, sir? A sort of sailing duck? Or a thin red herring. I've arranged passage for you under the name of Thomas Brighton. Brighton is, or rather was, a Tory and a traitor. Perhaps it would be well for you to continue that pose. What are my orders, sir? To discover how and from whom the Barbary Pirate learns about our ships' sailings. - Is that all, sir? - That's all, major. Accept my very good wishes. It's unfortunate in our new nation that we must depend on one man's efforts in such a crisis. Good luck. Thank you, sir. - Good evening, major. - Evening, sir. Hope you folks have a nice trip. - Thank you. - Thank you, Gilbert. Thank you. Oh. I'm terribly sorry. I-I'm afraid I tripped. That's quite all right. - Are you coming, Anne? - Yes. Oh, yes, of course. Thank you for assisting me. Surely you're not making this voyage? Well, yes, with my brother. Good evening, Miss Ridgeway. The purser obliged me with your name. How nice of him. It seemed a shame to waste time getting acquainted. You don't seem the sort of person to waste time at anything, Mr. Brighton. Mr. Brighton? Well, yes. I... I happened to see the purser and... Did you have to bribe him, too? Certainly not. I just asked him and... Oh. Well, I didn't... I don't mean exactly... I understand. Well, excuse me, I think my brother's looking for me. Wait. Won't you sit down for a moment? Well, just for a moment. Your brother can find you easily enough. About this voyage, surely you don't intend to continue past Gibraltar? - Why not? - Why, it's too dangerous. There's every chance we'll be attacked by the Barbary Pirate. Sam says people take the Barbary Pirate too seriously, that he isn't as dangerous as they say. Then Sam is an idiot. Thank you, sir. You'll excuse yourself, Anne, and come with me. It seems ridiculous to me, Captain Crawford, that the American government allows unescorted vessels to sail past Tripoli. We're a young country, Mr. Brighton. We haven't enough navy to convoy every merchant ship. And we never shall have enough. So long as the colonies remain independent. - What's that, sir? - I'm merely saying that if we were still British we'd have some protection and our lives wouldn't be in constant danger. I consider that remark treason. You may consider it anything you like, sir, but as for me, I want no part of that feeble little country that calls itself the United States of America. Good evening. A coward and a traitor make a nice combination. Ship off the port. What manner of ship? Can't tell, sir. Ah, it's the Barbary Pirate. Have the gun crew prepare for action. Aye, sir. Gun crew, prepare for action! Ahoy, Americans. Heave to, and prepare to be searched. Fire! What is it? What's going on? We're being attacked. What's that? Pirates. The Barbary Pirates. We'll be needed on deck, sir. Let the sailors defend us, Mr. Fielding. That's their job. Young man, I was at Valley Forge. No one else did my fighting then, nor will they now. Good day, sir. Well, I warned you. Now we'll all be taken prisoner or killed. Sam! Sam! Sam! Sam! Come back here! Let me go! So you're the only officer left, huh? Aye. Good. Then take me to the treasure. I don't know what you're talking about. Where is it? I tell you, I don't know what... I can tell you where the treasure is hidden, sir. - Who are you? - Thomas Brighton. What you're looking for is among the captain's effects. I trust you're not so foolish as to try to deceive the Bey of Tripoli. He would have found it, anyway. At least the mate wasn't tortured. No. Because you betrayed a secret he would have died to keep. But what difference does it make... My sister doesn't want to talk to you. Have this man brought to me after the prisoners are put ashore. So you are the American who is not an American, hmm? I'm a Tory, loyal to his Britannic majesty. And you think I will approve of you for that? Well, I do not approve. I have no use for traitors. It's Jefferson and his friends who've committed treason, not I. You have some spirit. Of that I approve. Well, what shall be done with you? Perhaps I could be of value, your majesty. In what way? I know American customs and habits. I could help in planning the capture of their ships. Help in planning? We require no help. No ship with a cargo of any value has escaped us in many months. Then you are very foolish, your majesty. You shall not speak such words to the Bey of Tripoli... A moment, Murad Reis. Let us hear him out. I would suggest that it's extremely foolish to capture every ship. If an occasional vessel slips through, the number of unprotected voyages will increase. So? Each captain will think he's the lucky one. For every 10 ships daring your waters, there'll be 20. Capture 15... you increase your prizes by five. Murad Reis, we can learn from this newcomer. Release him. Give him quarters. In the morning, we shall hear more. Your majesty. Sit down. Sit down. Thank you. Eat. I... I'm never hungry after a long voyage, your majesty. So, Mr. Brighton, you have any suggestions for today? If I were more familiar with the situation... What you really mean is, if I let you live, you will be of value to me. Wait. You have saved my life. How did you know about the knife? I happened to look up and... Did you see the one who threw it? No, your majesty. It is of no importance. You have saved my life. Guard, search the palace. I want the assassin found and killed. Now, Mr. Brighton, you will be my friend. Thank you, your majesty. You shall be my personal guard and counselor. You like that? Yes, indeed, your majesty. - Go away. - Where's the girl? Go away! You're making a mistake, young man. I don't think I am. Wait. It was very foolish of you to follow me here, Mr. Brighton. Why did you do it? I was interested in something you did. You saw me... Yes. If you had told the Bey, I should be dead. Instead it is you who must die. But why? Why should you want to kill me? You admit I saved your life. You saved the Bey's life, too. Take him away. Wait a minute. Who are you? Why are you doing this? Because you seek favors from Yusef, you are his friend. We seek freedom and are his enemies. I'm no friend of Yusef's. You would not expect us to believe that. I'm working against him, too. Oh, come now, Mr. Brighton. If I were his friend, I would have told him about her. You're too shrewd for that. You let her lead you to the rest of us. And followed her alone? Don't you see, if I'd wanted to capture you, I'd... I'd have brought the palace guard. Maybe he's telling the truth, Rindeff. We cannot take the chance, Zoltah. Can we chance killing someone who might help us? Just who are you? Thomas Blake. Major, United States Army. That should be easy to prove. You will show us your identification. Surely you don't think I carry papers with me that might become my own death warrant. Well, are we to put him to death? No, let him live. You're risking all our lives, Zoltah. And for what? Because I consider Major Thomas Blake a good risk. Mr. Sharpe, now that I am president, I'm going to give you the opportunity to prove the merits of your argument. My argument, Mr. President? I suggest that you go to Tripoli immediately. Ask the Bey to release all American prisoners and sign a treaty of friendship with us. If he agrees, pay him the tribute. And if he doesn't agree? Otherwise, we shall have no choice but to declare war. Yes, Mr. President. Uh, one thing more. Major Blake, an American officer, is acting on my orders in Tripoli under the name of Brighton. Contact him for any assistance you may need. Very well, sir. I intend to follow your advice and let an occasional fish swim through the net. I am sure you will find it profitable. Your majesty, how does it happen you never attack an escorted vessel? Even a child does not touch a hot stove. But how can you be sure which vessels are escorted and which are unescorted? You seem to be in a very inquisitive mood, Mr. Brighton. And since you enjoy asking questions, I have just the mission for you. Yes, your majesty? There are many Americans in my dungeons. They're expensive to house and feed. I do not wish to destroy those who hold promise of ransom. I thought perhaps you, as another American, uh, resident... You want me to decide who is to live and... and who is to die? Exactly. But, your majesty... They're all loyal Americans. - It should amuse you. - Of course. Begin this afternoon. Murad Reis will accompany you. Perhaps if I were alone with the Americans, they'd talk more freely. You don't trust me, your majesty? I trust all my friends, Mr. Brighton. But only so far. We'll go in here first. I've come to ask you a few questions, Miss Ridgeway. If you cooperate, I can get you out of here. I thought I was Yusef's prisoner. I can help you if you'll listen to me. Please leave me alone. So, Miss Ridgeway, you come from a wealthy family. Don't be ridiculous, I'm... It won't do you any good to deny it. What are you talking about? You've given me all the information I need. I haven't given you anything. Now get out of here! Your servant, Miss Ridgeway. She's quite an actress. Is she? Shall we move along? Major Blake. Major Blake, sir! I'm afraid you've made a mistake. Don't you remember me, major? Dexter, Dexter Freeman. I served under you at Yorktown. You remember Dexter, sir. I was never at Yorktown. It's been several years, sir, and we've both changed, but I'd remember you anyplace, Major Blake. My name's Brighton, not Blake. You're mistaken! They get strange ideas after a few months in prison. Some do, some don't. I guess I was mistaken. I could have sworn it was Major Blake. - He looks exactly like... - Ah, it's dark down here. You don't believe me, do you, Mr. Ridgeway? That man was on the Salem Star. He's a Tory coward named Brighton. You just made a mistake. No. I knew the major too well. I don't know what's happened to him. That man is Thomas Blake. Why would he pretend? Unless... Unless what? Nothing. Doesn't matter. Not now, anyway. What are you doing with that? When I left Boston more than 20 year ago, King George was running it. Now it's a free land. United States of America. I ain't likely to see it again. But if I ain't free, my country is. Must be a right proud thing to live under this flag. I would suggest you permit all the prisoners to live until your annual tribute has been paid. America will pay whether they are alive or dead. I agree. But it's always wise to have a bargaining point. Is that all? Yes, except, uh, the girl from my ship, Miss Ridgeway, should be well treated. Oh? Her family is wealthy. They will pay ransom. Get her, Murad Reis. Ah, news from your homeland, Mr. Brighton. We shall read it first. Here, you read it. Well? I... I don't understand this. There must be some mistake. There is no mistake. Read it. I... I already have. - Aloud. - But, your majesty, I... Mr. Brighton, I've given you an order. "Yusef, Bey of Tripoli, from Albatross, "The Hazard, the Scorpion, and the Flint "Sail on the 12th, 17th and 21st respectively. They will be unescorted." Good, good. Is there more? Haven't you read it? No, Murad Reis translates for me. Since he was not here, I thought you would take his place. I am honored, your majesty. This is another way of which you can be of value to me. You may act as my secretary. Yes, your majesty. Uh, finish the letter. There is no more. That, uh, that was all. You will give it back to me. Of course. Force of habit. A very bad habit, Mr. Brighton. I must show this letter to Murad Reis tomorrow, so I can plan my strategy. Ah, Miss Ridgeway. My friend, Mr. Brighton, tells me you should be given better treatment. I'm not interested in Mr. Brighton's efforts on my behalf. But I am inclined to agree with him. Zoltah, Miss Ridgeway is to receive all the comforts given to members of my household. Yes, your majesty. If you will come with me. You see, my friend, how quickly I accept your suggestions? I am flattered, your majesty. The Barbary Corsair is also capable of recognizing beauty and of treasuring it. His majesty's favorite scent. Why has the Bey had me moved from prison? Maybe his highness has taken an interest in you. I can thank Mr. Brighton for that. - Mr. Brighton? - Yes. If you knew him as I do, you'd despise him. But I don't know him as you do, Miss Ridgeway. ...and therefore I intend to permit the Hazard to escape. I will sign it later. And now, my friend, if you will excuse me, I am expecting a very lovely visitor. Miss Ridgeway? Perhaps. Your majesty, when I suggested that Miss Ridgeway be given better quarters, I didn't think that she... I know what you thought. You're interested in Miss Ridgeway yourself. And to prove that I am your friend, I will let her choose between us. I have sent for her. Come in. Ah, my dear, how very charming you look. And you owe it all to Mr. Brighton. I don't want to owe him anything. Are you so certain? What would you say if I let you choose between serving him or me? I'd rather stay in prison than wait on him. Apparently, my charm is irresistible. Good night, your majesty. Wait, my friend. Allow me my little joke. Joke? Take her, she is yours. If you had admitted you wanted Miss Ridgeway, you would have had her immediately. Since you did not, I chose to play a little game with you. And now, good night. Miss Ridgeway, I hope you sleep well. Well, Mr. Brighton. You rise early. I... I couldn't sleep, your majesty. I thought I'd start organizing your files. Hmm. Your industry is commendable, but unnecessary. My files are in excellent order. Besides, no one is allowed to go through them without my permission. Yes, your majesty. Since your motive was good, I will forget that you broke a law. This time. Just a minute! You have taken nothing from my files? Your majesty. You're my friend. You will not mind if I, uh, search you? Since I am your friend, is that necessary? Have you anything to conceal, Mr. Brighton? If so, it will be best that you confess. I conceal nothing. Search if you like. Nothing yet. You mustn't overlook my boots, your majesty. Hmm. I am satisfied. But I've been betrayed so often I've grown too wary. Your majesty will find me loyal to those I serve. Zoltah, read this. Who is this Albatross? That's what I hoped you'd tell me. The Bey's code is a well-guarded secret. Major Blake, what's the matter? I wanted evidence against a traitor. Now that I've found it, I can't use it. You can't hang a code name. Wait a minute. There must be a key to this someplace. But where? The alcove, where he writes his secret letters. The code might be there. - I'll search it. - It's too dangerous. The room is near Yusef's bedchamber. He would hear you. That's a chance I'll have to take. I'll go with you. But why? Why should you risk your life? Because this is our fight, too. Because you will need someone to watch. Because I do not wish you caught. All right, Zoltah. We are now what you call partners in crime. That's right, partners. Tonight. "Albatross." I'll translate. "Albatross: Tobias Sharpe, United States of America." Tobias Sharpe. Ow! We'd better get out. No, the guards will be out there by now. Hide behind the drapes. Your majesty! Your majesty! What are you doing in this room? I heard a noise in here. When I came in, someone stabbed me and ran into the corridor. Could you identify your assailants? No, your majesty. You saw him? We saw no one, your majesty. As always, you were asleep. Search the palace. I wonder what could have been in this room that was of such value, Mr. Brighton. I don't know, your majesty. I suppose not. If you wish to retire again, I'll stay here until the intruder is found. The intruder, Mr. Brighton, has already been found. What? You don't believe me? Hmm. He's in this very room. Who is your confederate? Are you sure it was a man who attacked you? I... I don't know, your majesty. There are so many things you don't know. First you betrayed your country, Mr. Brighton, then the Bey, and now me. You're not going to succeed. Your majesty, I had a confederate. Mr. Brighton. So you decide to confess, huh? Yes. Yes, I'll confess everything. Mr. Brighton wants to kill you. He betrayed you, as he betrayed his country, as he has betrayed me. So... Forgive me, my friend, for suspecting you. Take her away. You've got to take him, too. He's as guilty as I am! You must realize, my suspicions were natural. If you were the girl's friend, she would have protected you. I understand, your majesty. I am glad to have found a man whom I can trust. Alms. Alms for the love of Allah. Alms! Rindeff. I want to talk to you. I... Please, noble sir, a coin for an old man. Yusef found Zoltah hiding in the alcove. How did you escape? She tricked him, told him I was a confederate. Zoltah understands the way his twisted mind works. He thought that she was lying to involve you. Yes. I'll, I'll do whatever I can to help. Rindeff, I want to get this message to the American consul at Tunis. I will take it, major. I hope this hangs Tobias Sharpe, a traitor and a friend of Yusef's. If it doesn't, Zoltah will suffer for nothing. No, major, you're wrong. Zoltah will suffer and die for what she believes. To die so is not for nothing. Who are your friends? I have no friends. Why do you lie? If you tell the truth, who knows? I might forgive you. Ah, Mr. Brighton. You've missed nothing so far. Bring in the cauldron. You will find this most amusing. Observe, Mr. Brighton. Proceed. I give you another chance. Who are your friends? My friend, you must look. This is your revenge. - But, your majesty... - Look! Who are your friends? No friend. The other hand. - Your majesty, this is... - Yes? She... She's fainted. There is no point in continuing if she feels no pain. We will try again tomorrow. If you will excuse me, I'll be in my quarters. Mr. Brighton, your servant is here. - What? - Your servant. Please, please, forget all that nonsense. I don't understand you. Why not? You go to a lot of trouble to bring me here and then you treat me as though I were a part of the furnishings. You know why I brought you here, Miss Ridgeway. Yes, I, I suppose I should say thank you. I didn't ask for your thanks. Why are you a traitor? What? Why are you a Tory? What has America done that you should hate her so? My beliefs are my own affair. I've known Tories before, Mr. Brighton, but, well, somehow, those first two days in the ship, well, you seemed so different and kind and honest. I've always been exactly what I am now. Yes. Yes, of course. Anne, wait. The only reason I haven't told you is that I... Well, it might involve you, and I didn't want that. Involve me? In what? Anne, darling, I'm... Come in. His majesty wishes to speak to you. Tell his majesty I'll be there in a few minutes. You are to return with me, now. All right. I'll be back soon. Come in, come in. I need your advice. Yes, your majesty. My border guards captured a spy. I thought you might invent an interesting way of disposing of him. I'll try, your majesty. Good. In fact, I'm afraid I must execute two traitors. Don't you agree, Major Blake? Good day, Miss Ridgeway. I thought Mr. Brighton was with you. Mr. Brighton, or perhaps I should say Major Blake, has been detained. Major Blake? It seems, my dear lady, that Mr. Brighton is an American officer sent here by your government. Sent here? Alas. We have both been cruelly deceived. What have you done with him? He is awaiting his executioner. How much time have you got, major? I don't know, maybe midnight, maybe morning. Yusef's playing on your nerves. He just wants to see you break. Major, I... I'd like to apologize for... I know, Mr. Ridgeway. I know. I wish there was something I could do. There is. When you're ransomed or freed, tell your sister that I wasn't... what she thinks I am. I understand, major. Major. Major Blake. Look! She's one of ours! Can you make out her markings? I think she's the Constitution. Mr. Sharpe, you have two hours for conference with the Bey. If you haven't returned in that time, my guns will adjourn the conference. But, commodore, this is absurd! There are women and children in that palace. Mr. Sharpe, we are here to break the power of the Barbary Pirates at all cost. You should be ashore by 8:00. We shall begin firing at 10:00. Good luck. Thank you, sir. Uh, Murad Reis, take this order for Blake's execution to... I did not send for you. I came of my own accord, your majesty. For what reason? I want to make a bargain with you. Let Major Blake live and... What can you offer in exchange that I do not already possess? Your majesty, I won't deny that I'm in love with Tom. If he lives, I could forget that love. If he dies... Major Blake's doom is now sealed. By dawn, he will only be a memory to us both. Yes? Your majesty, Tobias Sharpe has arrived with the American tribute. I was planning an immediate execution. However, business before pleasure. You will wait for me here, Miss Ridgeway. A very good joke, Sharpe! I agree to release American prisoners and to stop attacks on the ships of the Unites States of America. You have a sense of humor! It's no joke. There will be no more tribute. The Americans are cowards. They will go on paying. I don't want to see this end any more than you do, but it's over. That warship in the harbor will start firing at 10:00 unless the treaty is signed. Now, what are you going to do about that? I shall not be in the palace. I shall be safe in my dungeons, and the American prisoners will be here. Commodore Preble's gun will save the edge of my executioner's sword. An excellent idea! If you will permit me, I will join you in the dungeons. You are welcome, Sharpe, but if the Americans choose to commit this act of war, I shall not be slow to accept their challenge. His majesty's orders. The American spy is to be executed at once. Give me the keys! Ow! Tom! - Anne! - Tom, we have to hurry! - Are you all right, Anne? - Yes, I'm all right. Where's Yusef? - He's talking to an American. - American? Yes, he came off the ship in the harbor. If we can get to this American, maybe he can help us. You don't know who he is, do you? Oh, no, I don't remember. Oh, yes. Murad Reis said his name was Sharpe. Tobias Sharpe? Yes, that's it. Do you know him? Yes, I know him. Hold the chains so they won't know we've unlocked them. Anne, lock us up again. Miss Ridgeway, what are you doing here? I came down to say goodbye to... the Bey instructed you to wait. Take her to his majesty. All of the American prisoners are to be released! You mean, we're really free? The Bey of Tripoli gives his word that none of you will return to prison. Take them to his majesty's quarters. Why are we being taken there? It would seem, Major Blake, that the American vessel plans to shell the palace. The Americans are friends of ours. We would not wish to see them without a target. Captain! Captain! Come on. We've got to stop the Constituti from firing! Guards! Guards, a prisoner has escaped. We must find him. You get help! I can hold them off! Come. We will get the others. Mr. Jackson, have the gun crews stand by. Yes, sir. Gun crews, prepare for action! Looks like we made it, Sam. I am afraid you are jumping to conclusions, my friend. I cannot permit you to leave Tripoli, Major Blake. It would be most inhospitable. I'm afraid I've overstayed my welcome. Take him. - Swim for it! - No, Sam! I hope you're a good swimmer, major! It is 10:00. The ship has not begun firing. Maybe the commodore has given you an extension. I had told you that the Americans would not dare attack the Barbary Corsair. Well, if they do not oblige by slaughtering the prisoners, I will have to do it myself. Man off port, sir. - Hold your fire. - Throw him a line. I'm Thomas Blake, sir. Major, United States Army. I know. I was told to expect you. The Bey has tricked you. If you fire now, you'll only kill American prisoners. I have no alternative, major. You could send a landing party ashore. They could capture the palace. Major Blake, I have no one aboard who knows the arrangement of the palace. I know it, sir, and I have friends among the prisoners. Very well, major, you shall lead the landing party. Thank you, sir. Get over there with your friends! So, you still live. You're lucky the ship did not fire. Now, since you have my word that you will not be returned to prison, the executions will begin. Oh, no! Please! Stop begging! We know he has no mercy. Let us die fighting. Hey! - Thank you. - Thank you. Major Blake, I wish to compliment you. When I return to Washington, I shall recommend that you be decorated. And when I return to Washington, Mr. Sharpe, I shall recommend that you be hanged. Throw him in irons! This is absurd, major! I... I'll have you court-martialed. I... I... I would like to have that, Major Blake. It will remind us of the beginning of our freedom and our American friends.
