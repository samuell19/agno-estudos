MAIDEN BRIDGE Director To be honest, Relja, I don't believe in this exchange. The headquarters announced that everything was agreed. We now have nine prisoners. With the major. - Ours will get three for him. Among them are also two important comrades. We got everything out of the major. Let them do what they want with it. Don't think too much. You must hand over the captured Germans to the corps. Let them stay alive until the exchange. - Do not be afraid. The exchange is only in seven days at Dekliške most. Are yours ready? - They're waiting. It's good that the corps sent Jelena. He speaks German. And the path. Take care, Marko. Only you know about this task. Major three, Hans two. It's five. SS man two, that's seven. And six times one, so thirteen of us. This is not right, Relja. - What? - This bill. They shoot a hundred of ours for one dead German. But we get thirteen for nine alive. If I were to decide, I would double the number. The commander, 111th Battalion, penetrated the small town. Good luck, Marko. And watch out. The life of every German prisoner means the life of one of our own. These villages are whole. - What do you mean whole? They are not burnt. How's it going, girl? - Go if you have to. Bless this Volksdeutsche. - Because they carry it? - No. Because you care about him. He is seriously wounded. They sent me away because of him. It must be important. Did you catch them all? Only the major, the spy and Rudi. Rudi was a living language. - What language? - He's alive. When we need information about the enemy, we catch a German. Long live the German, long live the language. We got Speglar, the quartermaster, off the lorry. What are you? - We took it down. - You mean captured? What's your name? - From Kosmaj. - It's a nickname. What about the real name? Promise you won't laugh. - Okay, you have my word. Procopius. Do you see? My classmates also always teased me. So Proka. That's what my mother called me when I was little. Bless you, Jelena. You have a name from heroic songs. Take cover quickly! Marko! Offensive again. They penetrated into free territory. Jelena, can we get to Suhe dol through the forest? You can cross the pass. - Let's go quickly. We'd better get back. - We have to get to the corps in Suha dol. We'll be back when we deliver them. Are you sure the corps headquarters was in that village? In this house was the hospital, and there was the headquarters. Where are they? - Who knows! They are fighting somewhere. Now what? - Back to the brigade, otherwise the Germans will capture us. What will we do with the prisoners? - We will kill them. I will kill them! What are you looking at me for? - Shut up. The guide understands. - We have orders to deliver them alive. What are you waiting for? Hand them over. - I will too. In the brigade, they know where the corps headquarters is. It's offensive. We won't get far with them. They will not cry in the corps because of nine Swabians. For these nine Swabians, we will get thirteen of our own. They will be exchanged for ours. - You're lying! You made that up now. Any exchange with the Swabians? No one has ever accused me of lying! I won't let you either. I will tell you everything then decide whether we should kill them. Go. How is he? -Better. Will you? - For that murder? Not even dead. You can do that. Listen. If we killed them, we would kill ours. What are you getting them to do? I'll kill you right now! They are afraid that we will kill them. He urges them to escape. Guide, this is nonsense. Nothing will happen to you. Translate. A partisan officer guarantees that nothing will happen to us. Major demands evidence. It's because you threatened to kill me. If it were up to me, I would shoot him and there would be peace. Tell them about the exchange. - You are crazy! Did you hear me? If they know we can't do anything to them, they'll come after us. Better that than running away. You're right. You should shoot them. If only! Let's go. We have to go the other way. We are surrounded. Get up! What about Đorđe? - How many inhabitants does your village have? About 400. Why? There were so many in his too. Now there are only 40 left. They killed them. His blood boiled when he saw Suhi down. But that's why he mentioned undamaged villages... Did he study law? - Yes. I didn't know he came from a farm. The war brought him back to the countryside, and my father brought me back. That's why I didn't finish school. - You will finish, there will be time. What would you do if someone told you that you will guard the German while he is smiting? I would kill him all in turn. Don't shoot! We have come across a position. Which side are ours on? Help! They left the stretcher. Hurry up for a guide! Did you hear? Help! Go get it! I will kill you! They have already started nagging. You don't! You and Horst are not going! Jelena, stop. Back! Wait! - But Hans... I will. It's good, they didn't hit him. Until the end of the war, they will be fraternized. What does this man want? It pays tribute to your bravery. He will give you a promotion. I'm ashamed of you. You are not soldiers, but cowards! Lets go! Take the stretcher. I like the Major. A true soldier. I like it too, but in captivity. Who is there? Are you from Jezava? - Yes. - What are you doing here? I'm guarding. We escaped from the Swabians. Here is the stable. Take us. Stop! - Wait, he's going to shoot. Grandpa! They are ours! Kosmajian. - And the others? - Partisans. We are leading German prisoners. Don't be afraid. Are our people going to kill us? - Let's be careful. I saw you in the brigade. What accident brought you here? Hello. What about the brigade? - They retreated somewhere. They fought like lions until the Swabians rushed in from all sides. A lot of Germans fell. SS units. Did he mention SS units? - Yes. He says a lot of them fell. You're lying! - Away! You all lie! Everyone! The SS... Why are you challenging? You better be quiet. I won't forget that. You will remember Horst Wagner! Get some rest. We will eat. We will share what we have. Stan! - No thank you. We ate an hour ago. Just give us water. We are thirsty. Stan, pour the milk. You've heard of the brigade. What will we do now, Marko? We will have to go to Dekliški most by ourselves. Do you know where it is? - That's easy. Just to make our way to the river. It's cold. Good for this trailer. But not them! It's not even enough for children. I can only give them water. Lets go. Hurry up. Hi, mate. Carry it. Daughter, take care of yourself. If he hadn't hit him, I would have... Give me milk. Take it as a travel card. Better leave it for the kids. - Take it, it's heavier for you. Take care of yourself. Come on, play. I have no other. How long will we walk? We and they will collapse. - We'll last. There are three days left until the exchange. We must stick to the river. Maybe the Maiden's Bridge isn't on the river at all. What do you mean? - That's right. There are, for example, Beli potok and Krivi vir, but the water is only in wells. Let's rest. Hey you! Gestapo man. I'm not a Gestapo man. Remove this character or reverse the cap. I keep thinking you are not a prisoner. I'm from care, you understand? Food... Marmalade? Not good. Fritz! do you smoke I'm Kurt, not Fritz. Take a cigarette, Fritz. Thank you very much. Fools, they shoot their own. It is not written on their foreheads that they are Germans. What are we waiting for? For the Swabians to come down and for Marko to replace us. George! Come back! I'm fast! Hurry up! They led us into a trap. If we make it to the top, we are saved. Climb! What does he say? - He is afraid of snakes. - Better snakes than Swabians. We won't succeed with them. Tell Mark we have to make a deal. He listens to you. - What would you agree on? It leads us deeper into the ring. He went crazy with this exchange. He trusts the Germans. It was probably made by one of our own, a Slovenian. Climbs like a chamois. You're right. We will not get away with them. I'm not moving on until I've made out with Mark. Watch out, snake! Don't be afraid, sit down. Don't think of yourself as SS nonsense. Marko! Come on. We have to get rid of them. There is no other way out. No talk! We got a task. But I know the way to the bridge. - You're going to get there the hell! You see that Germans are everywhere. - We would be lost without them. It's enough. - Now let it go. - Marko insists on the bridge. The task no longer exists. We are pulling the strings of Hansa. We will all die because of him. - Let go of Hans. I am responsible for him. A Kosovan girl walks in the field, sings about horses and heroes. You are wrong if you think you belong among the heroes. So I judge... Thank you, comrade. Enough! We have to get to the top. - We would have gotten further without them. Without them, we wouldn't even be here. Let him go. He is a foundry. They see everything through the square. How do foundries look? - Chequered. You don't understand that. - How can I not understand? Nice. Jelena looks at everything optimistically. Me pessimistically. And you? - I'm communist. Don't get angry around me any more. - Why? I'll kiss you, let them shoot me! You're crazy. - I am, you. Can't you see that I keep looking at you through the square? Pessimistic. Shall I bring the milk? - No, we have an expert. What an expert! Why is that bridge called Kliški? In my village there is a rock called Skočila Djelica. Some unrequited love. If I were to jump now, what would this rock be called? I would call myself a buttnska. I am! Quick! Marko, come. Two are missing. - How are you missing? - They're not there. Call Kosmajčan. Search every corner. Maybe they didn't enter the cave. - Impossible. I was leading, Đorđe was at the beginning. You told them everything. They know we can't do anything to them. For the last time, I ask you where they are. I guess you didn't... - No, they're at theirs. What happened? - Nothing. I accidentally hit the machine gun against the wall. The Germans could come. - Do you think they heard? I do not know. The refugees can bring them here. Let's go, Kosmajčan. If we're not back by dawn, go. Watch out for the girl. You know, Kurt, when an American catches a Japanese, The Japanese man stuffs explosives into his pockets and they fly into the air together. This is a fabrication. So, Fritz? I'll give you a cigarette, and you... I'm not Fritz, I'm Kurt. Will you? - Please. Thank you, Fritz. Now move on! Stop it! The gentleman probably prefers Wagner. Stop it! Order them to line up. Get in line. You! What do you want? This is terror! That's right, Major. In my village, farmers were eliminated like this. There were also women with children, Major. They skipped me. Let them turn if they want. Where, Jelena? Back off. George, listen to me. - Back off. I thought you didn't believe in exchanges. I understand now. You don't really want her. It was a warning. Surrender your weapons. Don't come near me. They were joking. It drove him crazy. We will discuss this later. Things like this are court-martialled. Let's go to watch. Avoid stupid trips in the future. They threaten us all. Thank you. You have to forget. People are suffering everywhere. War is terrible. - You know what's scary? All these Germans have kind of the same eyes. I do not understand. Blue, no shine. I have blue eyes too. What then? - It's not about that. Yours are blue, but they have depth, a glow. They are alive. The Germans are coming. Can we save ourselves? - It's too late. Put out the fire. Now is your chance. Marko, there is an opening at the end of the cave, through which Kurt and the Bavarian probably passed. Maybe we can go too. - Lead us. Cover us. I am. Partisans, surrender. We know you're in. Bombs! - Wait, maybe ours are there. Nonsense, these are partisans. They changed their clothes. It's good. Sir Major, you are a traitor. You will be court-martialled for this insult. You forget that I am not a member of the Wehrmacht. I will prove that you helped the bandits. Do you think they would let us live if there was a danger of our own killing them? We left him a speed gun. - He calmed down. Don't worry, I'll take care. - He doesn't trust me at all. He doesn't trust the Germans. If they wanted to execute you and yours, I wouldn't trust them either. It's convenient for us. They will get five partisans for us. Two for Hans if he survives. So it would be bad for them if something happened to us. We would lose five of our men. Excellent, Mr. Major. What nonsense are you talking? Stop playing the hero. I want our husbands to see mothers again, wives and children. That goes for me too. You see, five bandits! A break! We can't go on, we're hungry. Give us something to eat. Find food, people will not last until the exchange. Let's see where we are. Here we are. You, spy, know this terrain well. Speglar must be a Gestapo man. They're nervous again, they're hungry. But we don't? They make us gag. Speglar says that there is a mill nearby where he was supplied. Mirror good. Not the Gestapo. Intendancy. Good thing we'll get to the river. What is? Can't live without food? - They are protesting. Tell them we'll get food in two hours. I'll give you boots for bread. I don't need them. I can give you a hand. I don't need her. You're kidding me. You don't have a duck. - I do, I swear. We'll get a duck in two hours. Civilization at last. Miss, may I have the guide's boots? Look at your civilization! Offensives follow everywhere. I'm going to see where to cross the river. Find some tools to bury him. You two! Take it down. No! Wait. You decide. You are his best friend. You know my verdict. If you shoot him, I'll kill the others. You judged yourself. Go away! If I meet you anywhere, I will shoot you. Which he does right away. - Go, George. If only you could understand something. If she had taken down the miller, she would be alive now. I'm not sorry, Major. That's actually a good thing. They will get two less communist bandits. I admit I'm surprised. They are young, but they have their principles. They chased him away. They wanted to kill him. Really military! You were on the Russian front. I too. Now here we are fighting bandits. It's humiliating. - I don't understand you. This is war too. Much worse. 50 of our divisions are guarding these damned hills. Everyone is a partisan here and you don't know where they're going to shoot from. You look at problems in a purely military way. I'm here, Mr. Major. Now is the moment. Let's jump. You're crazy, Wagner. Return, I command you. Back! Stop it! Are you confused? Calm down! Traitors. Damn dogs! Don't you see what he wants? It's the devil! Traitor, we will not be replaced. There are two bridges here. We crossed the hanging one. - Is the second Girl? Look. Something is moving. I'll check. Maybe they are Germans. - Wait. Even the trees seem like Germans to us. I'm sure something has moved. - I know. I saw him at the bridge. Lets go. It reminds me of my Kosmaj, the most beautiful corner in the world. For everyone, their place is the most beautiful. You will be cold. Watch out for the Germans. They ran into him. It's going to fade, it's night. Let Jelena lead the prisoners to the old fortress. How about us? - Đorđe is unarmed. Quick, get up. Look. They stopped shooting. Stay here. And that moon... Does it really have to rise every night? Maybe they missed it. Say something. Just for Jelena to move away. It hisses like a snake. Look. What is? - Nothing. Shoulder. Hurry after Jelena. Everything is written here. Take it. Go quickly. I command you, go! Rockets, Marko, don't hiss. - They don't hiss, Kosmajčan. It's you, Đorđe. - Me. You're back. So Marko... stayed. Promise not to tell Jelena about Marko. I promise. Where are they? - At the old fortress. The guide is dead. He lost a lot of blood. - Careful. Quite slowly. The officer did not return. That's not good. Let's be very careful. Bury him. Tell them to bury him. They obey when they have to bury their own. It's good. Hans left you a stretcher. I'll just lay dead on them. This is decided by the health department. Now you can take his boots. Dear Marko, my brother was shot dead in the camp. Son, I don't know where you are. But the couriers will find you. Take care of yourself. Now I only have you. Good morning, man. Hi, son. Is there an army in the village? - Who would you like to meet? Ours. - Which ones are ours? - Guerrillas, dude. We are partisans. - Are those ours too? No. They are Germans. Prisoners. You are not allowed in the village with them. - Why? Here was the offensive. The Swabians shot everyone. Only the helpless remained in the village. They will tear them apart if you come with them. Better bypass the village. We have no choice, Đorđe. He won't last. We haven't eaten in two days. - What if people attack them? You wouldn't let me shoot at them. I guess you don't think I'll have my way? I shouldn't have brought them here. Stand up, people! We know we should kill them. But it won't bring our dead back to life. We are ordered to exchange the prisoners for our comrades. Now you decide. Who knows where the Maiden's Bridge is? I know. One, two... Three, four... Five. Hello, comrades! Replacement of Major Kolbe's group was carried out on 17.IX.1943. Six members of NOV were returned to the camps by the Germans and shot.
