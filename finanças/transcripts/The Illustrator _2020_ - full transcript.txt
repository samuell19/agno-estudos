Hi. -Hey. -Watch. Be safe! - Rachel! - Benjamin! Did you bring new... ...toys? -No but... Look what I brought. I brought some... some fish! In the morning of life came the good fairy with her basket and said, "Here are gifts. Take one, leave the others." "And be wary, choose wisely, oh choose wisely for only one of them is valuable." The gifts were five. Fame, love, riches, pleasure, death. The youth said eagerly, "There is no need to consider!" And he chose pleasure. He went out into the world and sought out the pleasures that youth... delights in, but each in its turn was short-lived and disappointing, vain and empty. And each, departing, mocked him. In the end, he said, "These years I have wasted! If I could but choose again I would choose wisely." See Benjamin? We have to choose wisely. We have to be wise. So how was your day? Why aren't you eating anything? I want new toys. You want new toys, huh? You weren't listening. Ben, you can't have everything in life! No new toys. Fine, I'll get you something. OK? Next time I go out, I'll look for something. Rachel? -There there... Good baby. Just let me sleep... Today's the day. Hello? -Hey mom! Thanks for sending me that check. It came just in time. They didn't cut off my electricity. -Glad to help honey. -Listen mom, I'm calling because the UNP just gave me a job offer. I'm hoping it will pay the bills and help keep my art business afloat. -Congratulations, it's about time. I'm just so happy for you! -I'm meeting a congressman today. -Oh my god! -It's sort of a job interview, but but everybody knows that if you get a call from them at all it means you're hired. So how's your pregnancy treating you? -I'm okay! When I was pregnant with you, your father, god rest his soul, would buy me these garlic crackers that got rid of morning sickness, but they're a little hard to find so I'm trying out these garlic sausages that are just fabulous. And the shop around the corner, makes these strawberry milkshakes that are to die for! -Mom? How do you think Dad would've seen all this? -Rachel, when your father died, we weren't exactly on speaking terms. And besides, you need the money. As long as you keep true to yourself, you'll be okay. -Mom, I gotta go bake a pie and pick out something modest to wear, since the UNP even has a dress code. -Good luck with your job interview honey. Remember Rachel, whatever benefits you get out of them, they're getting more out of you. Do you remember that recipe you did when you were back here? Back on the fourth of July? I was wondering, does it have anything to do with garlic? wing extremist, the UNP quicky spotted his growing popularity in South Florida due to his unconventional direct and practical solutions to the scandalous local city corruption. I recently caught up with the congressman and he conceded the network a formal interview, which is available on our website. Here are the highlights: Do you believe some United States citizens shouldn't be allowed to vote based on their annual earnings? No, that idea has been largely criticized due to the media's con--, persistent stereotyping and taking things out of context. This country was created for a specific type of American, and anyone that falls... falls out of our founding fathers ideal not not fit to vote. It's a luxury that cannot be taken lightly. And too many irresponsible voters cast their ballots only to the candidates with the biggest publicity campaign. So do you believe in democracy? That word, is misleading, and inflated to unreal proportions. We are not focused on names, or titles, but on actions. On actions. Our labor is aimed at the very best interests of the struggling American family. I'm a democratic man, but this party never really watches out for-- Hi, it's Rachel. It's... about the...contract? -Mhh ...under that amendment, Anderson would be able to get elected indefinitely.. What are your views on that Bob? -Well Miller, it's always a scary process. to undo an amendment. It's not even technically possible except when done this way. You should've come earlier. -Am I late? -No. ...Michael Anderson, why not elect him again? -So unfortunately, we've run out of time here. Thank you so much for taking a moment, to share. Your comments are always appreciated. -Mr. Rivero? Breaking news coming this morning... ...concerning a series of mortar attacks, yes, deliberate mortar attacks, on Jewish communities. The bombs seem to have fallen out of nowhere around eight AM. -So, the UNP has a channel now? -Oh! Eh, um... Baking is just a hobby of mine. I thought it would be good for celebrating. It's peach. I baked it myself. Maybe wine would've-- How do you know you've been accepted? -I know I have. -Sit down. -I see you have a saxophone. They were so popular in the eighties. My dad owned one. How did he die? Was it cancer? Look. Many years ago, hunters killed so many buffaloes in the western part of this country that today only a few remain. Do you know the reason, Rachel? You know? Greed. Greed created the media. The media is the most powerful weapon. Goes further than any rocket and deeper than any bullet. We are in a century of visuals. We need an artist, we need an illustrator. We need propaganda, Rachel. Look we know that you are the best at advertising. We know that. But we also know that you sympathize with these resistance fighters. This shaky tendency of yours is unacceptable. -My political inclination has been... undefined. But I had hoped none of that would matter. I mean, we all search for answers at some point in our lives. And I really want to believe that, that my search is over this time. See that sign? I can't stand the sight of it. I trust, you will be more convincing? Benjamin. Benjamin!? Where are you? Where are you? Where are you? This is a pine cone. It's round. - Oh. - Oh. Hi. How did you get in? Aah. No. No. No. Don't get too close. Ahh. Ahh! Well, I was planning on washing these anyway. By the way Benjamin, That was a very naughty thing you did this morning, Opening the door like that. I know Rosa isn't a stranger, but you can't open the door. Ever. I forgot to tell Rosa to bring your milk today, so I'll have to go by and bring it up tomorrow. It's a long walk but, Tina will take care of you meanwhile. With the bicycle broken now, it'll just take...longer. I'll even have to walk to Mr. Rivero. Now that's far. Oh! I forgot to tell you! We're finally getting that permit! We'll leave Florida in just two months, and... ...and go up north. There are lots of kids up north. They're going to want to play with you. Are you going to play with them, Benjamin? Yeah. Rosa! Rosa! It's me Rach-- Rachel. -Is Rosa here? I... I came for the milk. -Yeah. She's in there. -Hi. -Hi. -Oh! -The milk. Well. -How's the boy? -Mhh, good. -Mhh. Here. You need this more than we do. Oh. You shaved. I want... I want them done by Monday. Twenty posters... four... eh, banners... and one billboard... design. -It's too much. These larger works require a lot more paint than usual, and... and I'm running out of supplies... acrylics, oils, brushes, everything! Where am I going to find the resources-- -That's your problem, not ours. -All right. I'll go out and sack another art store or something. But... you do realize I can't keep producing propaganda for the UNP without visualizing my audience. As an artist I need to see results. New inspirations. It can't go on like this. Mr. Rivero... my signs... where does it all go? With all due respect... I don't think anybody is seeing my posters. Because all I see are works from before. When we had printers. -Patience, Rachel. I told you the printers are on the way. -For these campaigns to be effective you need feedback, criticism, encouragement. I can't manipulate a society I don't know. Perhaps if... if I could see -No, no, no, no. -If I could go north, to study. -No, no, no, no. You know that can't be done. You know that can't be done. After Florida's failed separation the UNP closed all transport, to and from here. You know that, Rachel Or do I need to give you another situation report? You had one last week. -How long has it been? Two more months, Rachel. Two more... months. You'll be rewarded for these years of loyalty. -And my brother too. So... is there any news from up north? On my way here I saw an old UNP helicopter. Do, do you if there is any... resistance fighting going around Miami again? -I want them done by Monday. Rachel! - Rachel! - What? Oh. -A little help? Is the coffee for me? -Oh, of course. Awfully generous of you to buy me lunch, dearest successful brother, though I must remind you it is illegal in the city of Miami to give food as charity. You'll need a license for that! It's not charity, it's being nice. Remember it's not a humiliation to declare bankruptcy. It happens. It could happen to anyone. -No. It's not that. I could care less for what people think. It's just that, I put so much effort into that art gallery. It hurts to have something you created taken away like that. I guess I'm just destined to be the poor struggling artist. -It doesn't mean the public doesn't like your art though. We all know it sells. But maybe you should've invested in some publicity to get the word out. Hired a secretary to manage your accounts? Perhaps? -I'm not a failure. -Nobody said you were. I played by the rules, and did everything that supposedly leads to success, and yet here I am. Broke. I am two months late on my rent. Submerged up to my neck in debt... I... I owe approximately $84,000. -Come on Rachel, don't paint it so bleak and depressing. There is always a way out. You could consolidate your student loans and move in with me and stay in the city. You don't have to move back into the outskirts of town. Maybe running the gallery was a little pretentious for these years of recession. -Aaron, please. All my faith and hope was set on that art gallery. It was all I ever worked for. You don't need a business administration diploma to know that... that the numbers just don't add up! They're not my mistakes. I'm supposed to go bankrupt. It's all strategically planned so that only a select few rise. Everything else is just a myth pack with lies. I need answers. So far... this seems to be the only option. Either you've developed a truly unique sense of humor, or have lost your mind completely! -I'm serious about this. -Aren't you working for the United Nationalist Party? -Mhh -You're currently serving the far-right. -It's just a job. -I understand... your desperation... but I don't wanna get my sister arrested or shot at by joining ranks with some bunch anti-social, unemployed, anarchist radicals! It's illegal Rachel and you know it! -How is it illegal to demand our rights as citizens? We simply seek that our country be returned to us. -This isn't the way. The Marxist agenda isn't gonna recapture the old United States. -Maybe not. But it's the only strong response to a police state. What would you suggest? Signing useless petitions that get you nowhere? Nobody likes to be played, to be used as a mere tool in keeping this massive capitalistic monster alive. The crisis could've been avoided. Yet here we are. The billionaires fled and left us a crippled and disintegrating union. So what are we gonna do about it? Cross our arms and live with the fact that they shutdown social security and cut-off our Internet access!? Rachel... lower your voice. Remember that we're in a public place. -You see to what we have been reduced to? I will not live in fear. I won't stand by and watch how protesting gets outlawed. Just because we're financially ruined doesn't mean we're gonna sell out what little liberties we have left. Tonight, I'm saying that aloud. -Rachel, Rachel, what has come over you? Take it easy. I don't like the way things are headed either, but taking out a communist flag is just crazy! They're executing people for that kind of talk now. It's scary, but as a traditionally conservative guy, I'm advising you to not get carried away by this political fight. There are other ways of addressing the issue. Can you believe Mom wants to have another baby? -Yeah. I know. -In these times of crisis she wants another mouth to feed. If it's a boy... They should definitely name him "Benjamin." Down with the UNP! - ...- sick and tired of this fascist police state... - Down with the UNP! ...sick and tired of this fascist police state... Down with the UNP! - Down with the UNP! Down with the UNP! Don't be afraid people! Speak up! Down with the UNP! Down with the UNP! Down with the-- Down with the UNP! New toy. Remember you wanted a new toy, Benjamin? Look. Oh my god! You're welcome Benjamin. -Oh! I can't believe you're driving so fast! I'll fix it, don't worry. Ugh! Ugh! Rachel! -What happened? Rachel, I heard a monster -Nothing Nothing's happened, Benjamin. Ahh. Rachel! I'm just here for the show! Where are you!? I see the fun house but you're not there! You're in the back? OK OK, just stay there, I'll be there, OK. Mr. Rivero! Oh, ugh, ah. ugh! -Where you robbed? Can you stand? - Did he take anything? - Don't worry. You have to report this to the proper authority! -No, don't worry, don't worry. I got it under control. I got it under control. But... but, the party has to know about what happens here! -Don't worry, don't worry. -You have to report this to the proper authority! Ask them for protection! -Rachel! It's all right. Looks like everyone knows I have the cure to the plague. He got it... didn't he? -Got what? -The vaccine! Why didn't he take it? If I was looting... the home of... the party's... Florida's congressman I'd... for sure 've snatched the crates of the vaccine, since the party boasted of... having the... the cur-- -Time for your monthly shot, right? OK, well... Wait here, wait here. Wait here. I still can't understand how it spread so quickly and the millions it claimed. But you... cant... detain a virus that's so contagious. I say it was created in a lab because... There no... no way something like that could've... naturally spawned so... so... strategically... uh... in the nation's most populated cities. But I have seen less and less disease victims lately. It's almost rare to see anybody stricken. Although, there aren't that many people left. But nevertheless, I do think the party's.... cure... is effective. Aah! Mhh.... Ooh! I was out the other day around the old... shopping mall on 49th street... and... there's another mass grave there. I... hadn't seen it before, it's... devastating. It still gets to me. Ahh. Ahh! Go away! Dad! Shh! Mh mhh! Ugh Benjamin, I told you to be quiet! Stay here. Huh? What is it? What are you--? Whoa! No no no! No! No! Ugh! Ugh! a piece here... horse here.... rookie.... horse again... king... no... queen... Aaah! Raquel, are you there? -Shh! What are you doing here? -Well, you told me to babysit every three weeks, and it's been very long. Raquel? What's wrong? What's wrong? -Girl, open the door. It's blazing hot! It's so hot the rocks are melting. Some heat! Can I get some water? -No, I have no water. I'm sorry. -Raquel, are you all right? -Oh... Tina, Tina, Tina... I was almost killed. Right through that window! This isn't... living... But you don't have to stay here. I know where there's a boat. -Where would I go? On vacation to... to Cancun? -To Cuba. -You mean Cuba? Cuba Cuba? Why haven't you gotten the boat? -And where is Benjamin? -Um... -If you ever decide to go, I wish you good luck. -And get some sleep! You have the worst dark circles. It's been a long time since... I haven't gone to Mr. Rivero's... and now we're out of food... and everything else. So I've decided... Tina's coming to take care of you.... while I'm gone. You'll be in good hands. Just behave. And I'll be back, just like before, OK? I'll be back. I'm coming back... just like... just like we always used to do. It's so easy for you. A life of innocence and... no worries. Why do I even bother talking. Raquel? Benjamin... Benjamin is waiting for me... I can do this. I can. Huh... uh... miserable! -Shh... You don't need these anymore. Hey! Wait! Hey! Wait! I just need the shoes! -Tomas? -Rachel? What went on here? Oh, uh... A UNP chopper crashed. Was he on it? -I don't know. I think so. But he won't make it. It's the liver. Mhh. Where did you get this? Who gave this to you? Do you work for Mr. Rivero? Have you been following me? Who do you work for? Where did you get this? Who gave it to you? I will die with honor. You won't get anything out of me. -Tomas, why did you leave the UNP? -What do you mean leave? -The UNP gives... interstate traveling passes. You could've left when your... when your contract finished. I mean... Why did you stay? -The UNP dissolved years ago. What are you talking about? Rachel? Do you have a problem with character, Rachel? With discipline? With rules? -I... -With authority? You were due last month. Where were you? -I've been having issues. It's personal. What issues could you possibly have? You live alone. -Precisely. It's a tough world out there. -Well then be tough. I guess you'll be wanting your shot now. Mr. Rivero... What ever happened to Tomas? Did he resign? -Sadly... he died of cancer. Did you forget that? Seems like cancer is killing everyone these days. I've got it. I think... I would rather not, take the shot now. I haven't contracted it, if that's what's bothering you. I haven't contracted it. A letter arrived today, Rachel. It explained that we need to adopt a more efficient... policy. The era of soft politics is over. People are angry, and troubled. And they need someone to blame for their misfortunes. Let me tell you something, Rachel. The jews, and blacks, will be our scapegoats this time. -But that easy finger-pointing is only going to lead to more violence. Wasn't our second civil war enough? -Goebbels... we need your help. -Help? You're asking me to incite hate in people? Against minorities? The helpless? -It is the survival of the fittest. and... and the UNP needs to survive. -I'm sorry but I really don't share your views. And I certainly didn't sign up for this. I can't take part in this anymore. I wanna see that letter. Where is it? I'd like to read it myself to understand those directions better. Maybe your mind's a bit cloudy now. -Rachel! The means are nothing... if the intentions are good. -Are your intentions good? -Are you gonna start acting like your father now? Like father like daughter? -What is this? -It's you. -Of course it's me. I picked this off from a dead guy on the road. What was he doing with my photo? I know you had something to do with this. It's got your name all over it. So I demand that you tell me, what the hell is going on? Since when did you know my father? -Who didn't know your father? The most prominent opponent to the UNP. -Who also died of cancer. Mr. Rivero no offense, but this is all turning into one big show. I mean, I don't mean to complain... constantly... but I get the impression I'm the only still rooting for the UNP. I mean, do you have anyone else working for you? Anyone else? -They are busy, like you... running interstate errands. -Never-ending errands. So let's just drop the bad joke. It's lost its pun. For years, you've kept me in the dark. Now I just want to know one thing... there's no permit is there? -In thirty days... you'll find out... just how wrong you are. What happened to you? -It's not just Florida, is it? It's the whole world! -If you keep acting like this, Rachel, delusional I'm going to have to call them to put you away. Call who? You're all alone! It's fake! Tomas is alive. And you are nothing but a fraud. You don't even have a working phone do you? -Remember your place here! -I'm not gonna forget about the letter. And I'm not leaving or even going to attempt to reason with you unless you show me that last letter from the party's headquarters. Where do you keep them? Where is it? Show them to me. -No no no no no, Rachel, Rachel.... -They're behind that door aren't they? -No! -What is behind that door!? -No! What? My work... ugh! Wait! Wait Wait! You don't understand! You don't understand! Rachel! It's not me! Come back! Rachhhheeeel! It's over. It's over. Where are you going now? -We are leaving, Benjamin. We'll pack whatever food... and stuff we have left. Later, we'll stop by Rosa and Eric's farm. -Why? -Because we can't stay here! Look. I'm done working for Mr. Rivero. It's time for us to go. Tina has boat. We'll go on Tina's boat. I need you to be very... very strong OK? Rosa! Eric! OK. Rosa! Eric! Oh... Eric. -Rachel. -I'm leaving. And I need a place to stay. Can I stay the night? -Sure. I don't care what the hell you were doing, I don't care what the hell you were doing, you get off my property! you get off my property! - you get off my property! - Listen to this sucker talk about "private property." Listen to this sucker talk about "private property." Man, ain't no property. Haven't you looked around? It's fucking over! It's the law of the jungle, bruh! Ain't no place in this world for suckers. -You get out, or I'll shoot you out! Slow down man! Slow down! - This is not your land! - Eric? Who are these people? This morning, I count my cattle and I turn up with one. Then I find these scumbags. They took the cattle in trucks! -Listen, calm down. Listen. We got a bunch of people up north.... OK? They need to eat something. All right? So let's take it easy. - Let's talk about it. - Not my problem! We got a community. They need to eat! OK? Come on man! Have a heart. -There's no community! Everything here is either dead or dying! Just look at yourselves! -We don't gotta do this the hard way, man. You don't wanna kill me. - You do that, you're gonna have a... - What? whole bunch of people here ready to skin you alive! - They know where I'm at man! - No. All right, so save me the speech! Mama's boy! All right look... look... All right look... look... I'm out! All right? I'm out! All right? I'm out! You were very brave today, Eric. You defended here. It was just an unequal fight. She was a perfect mom. completely devoted to you... and an honest woman. The type that doesn't exist anymore. And I'll always be a witness to that. Always. Eric the fire might attract other people-- -My father... was a political activist in Miami. We didn't always live in the country. When the UNP took power, there was a man in particular... he was a congressman... Dad didn't like him. He said... He said... that there was something... that there was something... truly evil about that guy. So we published some inside scoop... about the UNP... in the paper... We were branded as traitors... enemies of the state.... My father was executed. We couldn't live in the city anymore for obvious reasons. So we moved in with our... with my mom's side of the family. Living in tight quarters, the plague almost killed us all. My mom and I were the only survivors. Now with her-- -No no... You survived today, Eric, for a reason. Honor your mother, by keeping up the fight. You've got your whole life ahead of you. And as Rosa's only son, it's your duty to push forward. Don't fight to live... live to fight. And keep the memory of your mother alive. -How am I supposed to... move on when the farm is destroyed? -First, I'm gonna clean out your wound. We're going to adapt and survive. And now we walk. So... How exactly are we going to do this? I was told there was a working boat here, I just... hope nobody's taken it yet. -And who told you this? -A woman I know, um... Come on! Come on! Shh! Did you hear that? -Hear what? -Here there's the-- -What's going on? Rachel? Rachel! Why? How? -We are the UNP, Rachel. Everyone is part of it. How did you find that perfect babysitter? -You sent Tina? -We knew you were Jewish so... we couldn't trust you, completely. We didn't-- -Shut up! Shut up! Just shut up! There is no UNP! It's gone forever. Can't you see you've lost it? -I think you are the one who's lost it. -It's over. I'm through with everything. Get out of my way, 'cause I'm... leaving. -Your contract is not over. -Contract!? You just can't let go of me, can you? -I think you are not right in the head. So... You need some rest. We'll forget this episode. I forgive you. I don't want to see this end... like it did... with your father. I see it now. You're the vulture. That's my father's instrument. -Wha--? You took him away from me? So I could work for you? Ugh... -Rachel... Sometimes things just need to be. -You killed him. -Your father was wrong about the UNP. You killed him. He got what was coming to him. -You killed him. -He didn't know what was best for you -You killed him. -The UNP-- - I was best for you! - You killed him! You monster! For six long years, you kept me locked up in this... this... wasteland! Immerged in your lunacy! You took away my mother... my father... my life! I see it only fit... to take away yours as well. Ugh...
