Gentlemen, this way please! Xiao Si, serve the customers! My lords, have a drink. Hurry up, Xiao Si! Coming, coming! Gentlemen, please take a seat! Very Good! Master, you`re very skillful! Why are you still here? Didn`t they tell you to get lost? Yes! Yes! You three are very punctual. Jin Tianyun, we have nothing to do with you. Why do you call us here? Because you are murderers and rapists, l can`t stand anymore. So you want to be a hero? l just want to give you a little punishment. To chop off all your right hands. Then you`ll behave properly in the future. To the hero, l raise a... To the hero, l raise a toast ! No! Drink it first! Stop! Stop! Are you okay? Yes, yes! lt`s fun. Huang, you`re really something! Go! Don`t let him run away! Chase him! The Decent School of Martial Arts That was a good try. l`m coming! Again? Feel good? You jerk! Big Brother! What happened? lt`s him! Nothing, nothing! lt`s a mistake! Mistake? l think you did intend to touch her. No wonder the wet nurse said you`re always horny. Don`t regard Sister as a wet nurse! You jerk! When my dad comes home, you will be in trouble. No, l won`t dare do it again! And l`ll let you touch me and we can get even! You deserved it! He`s teasing you! Huh, does that amuse you? Blockhead, l guess you need a good beating. How dare you tease your brother? Brother! Big Brother, that blockhead disrespected me. Don`t you think he deserves a good beating? Forget it and continue practicing. Otherwise Master will blame us when he returns. Keep practicing! What are you looking at? Want a good beating? Gao Jian! He`s pretending not to hear you! Gao Jian! What`s the matter? Bring me two stone weights! Why don`t you get them yourself? l`m your elder, so you must do it for me. That`s right! Get it quick! What a feeble chicken! And he wants to learn martial arts? He is only good in bed. Hurry up! Hurry up! Quick! Gao Jian, kneel down! Master. Gao Jian, l took pity on you as an orphan. That`s why l keep you here to learn martial arts. But you`re not behaving well. You have no respect for your elders! lf you don`t like it here, you can leave! Master, it wasn`t my fault. lt was 2nd and 3rd Brother. And now you`re falsely accusing me as the villain! Master, don`t listen to him! He hurt us on purpose. Brother`s wound will get worse if we wait longer. Master, it hurts so much! Shut up! Dad! Let me check... That`s none of your business! What`s the first discipline of our school? Troublemakers and premeditated fighters will be punished severely! A crab! Eight claws! A head of this shape! A wink! A shrink! Hooray as it came! Good brother, drink together! A four, a five and a six! Drink til you`re sick! l`ll drink. l`ve never said no to a drink. Roasted chicken wing. My all-time favorite! And roasted pigeon? lt`s just amazing! That blockhead, where is he? He is exhausted! lt`s good to drink wine. The blockhead is being punished over there without any food. What are you doing? What do you want? Want to collect our bones? Shut up! A horse stance! Master said l can go when the incense finishes. Now it`s all burnt down! Burnt down? Not yet! Look carefully! Be patient, kid. Want to go? Horse stance! Want to sleep? Horse stance! Keep on the horse stance! l`ve been in this stance the whole night. l`m so out of shape, food doesn`t matter now. l`m so tired! Mr. Ghost, l`m not the one that killed you! l`ve nothing to do with you. Please, don`t scare me! Master! Master! Master! Forget it! lf l inform Master now, he`ll blame me all the same. What should l do? How dare you! You`re still alive! You`ve scared me so much! Where`s Gao Jian? l didn`t see him. Master, l`ll get him! Shut up and go! Gao Jian! What are you doing? Nothing! l bumped into 2nd Brother! Don`t you know the time? Lazy boy, go and practice! Master, have you heard of someone by the name of Jin Tianyun? Why do you ask about him? No reason. lt`s just that l`ve heard how amazing his technique is. He is pretty skillful, but he didn`t come from a decent school. Just in case you run into him in the future. You`d better turn away. Master, will you turn away if you run into him? Nonsense! Gao Jian, if you`d rather leave us, l`ll make it easy for you! Master, you got me wrong! Got you wrong? Master, this blockhead doesn`t really want to learn martial arts. He just wants a place to stay and have three meals a day. Third Brother, can you shut up? Why should l? Master, the stance you taught me a few days ago. ls it like this? Second Brother! Oh, it hurts! You bloody fool! Dad, 3rd Brother hit Gao Jian! What`s the first rule of our school? Troublemakers and premeditated fighters will be punished severely! Someone`s got a pig`s foot to sell! Someone`s got a ghost story to tell! Someone wants to yell without energy! Someone is standing on a bench, and shivering like hell. Who over there could be so ecstatic? l`ll feed you to a dog if l get hold of you. Wow, don`t be so cruel! Aren`t you tired? Talking wastes energy! Be careful! You must be out of breath now. Mind that you don`t die! Now l`m so angry l could die. Don`t be angry! l did that on purpose so Master would punish you. Now l can release my anger! l`m sorry! l stepped on your injured foot! Help! Hurry up! Go practice after eating! Hey, sharing is a virtue. This is an efficient world. Only the quick can survive, stupid! Yes! Come, get some sauce! lt`s better than nothing! Your overleft! Now you can have the most original taste! Brother Jin, you must be hungry. Take this. l don`t feel like eating. l`m sorry, l did want to bring you some food, but all those nasty brothers were so fast in clearing up all dishes. Rice is the only thing left. This one is untouched! Thank you, but l really don`t feel like eating. You`re seriously wounded and haven`t eaten for days. Your stomach will hurt. Come, for my sake! Have this bowl of rice! Come on! l`ll get you some tea. Your brothers fight for food? They always say this is an efficient world. Only those fast enough can survive! You must be the slow one! l`m the junior so they always bully me. Every meal, l only have rice with sauce! No food! lt`s better than what l have now! Original taste, right? Yes, that`s called the original taste. Rice has its own taste! Doesn`t it? My master said... your kung fu technique is stunning. But... What? Seems like he doesn`t like you! Who is your master? Shi Zhengzong. Have you heard about him? He was nicknamed Thunderstorm. He has good technique and has earned great acclaim. Thunderstorm? Do you think l am lying? lf he has good technique and reputation, how could l have broken his bones three years ago? You`ve beaten him up? l despise these hypocrites who call themselves ``the decent school of martial arts``. All they know is vanity! Don`t worry, l won`t beat you up! Because we are good brothers! Yes, we are! Brother Jin, are you okay? Tomorrow get me some medicine, Tianqi and Baiyao. Ten grams of Tianqi and 50 grams of Baiyao. Please get it from somewhere else! Why? l`ve got money! Get it quick! Tianqi and Baiyao! Do you need them for cuts? Hey, don`t you want to do business? What are you doing? Tell me now, do you need them for cuts? lt`s none of your business! l`ll cut your head off if you don`t tell me! Okay, okay! l`ll tell you. Mind the blade! l want it for my master. He`s wounded. Who`s your master? lt`s Thunderstorm. Shi Zhengzong! Hey man, let go of me! How did your master get hurt? My master is so unfortunate. While he was asleep, someone covered with blood suddenly came in. Blood? Yes, he was stabbed here! He knew martial arts. Have you heard of anyone who was stabbed here and didn`t die? Who is that man? My friend, why are you so rude? Release me first! Oh, my side! Tell me quick! Yes, yes! That man was covered by blood, but he could still survive! My master asked him what happened, then he tried to stab my master. l sensed something wrong so l kicked him. Go on, speak! Okay, it happened that l kicked right where he was stabbed. The knife went in two more inches. He gave out a loud cry! Then he turned away and ran. Of course, l chased him. He kept running, and l kept chasing. Where to? l was chasing him for more than a mile. Then he got on a horse and went east. And you lost him? Yes, it`s all true. Every word is so true! Boss! The one you met at the pharmacy is Fan San. He`s one of the Three Devils. He has good skills with his duel blades and a very bad temper. He is mean and nasty! The second one is Zhou Sanzhao, a womanizer. Very good with darts and secret weapons. Never missed a target! The leader of the three is Yan Qingwang. He is ruthless and insidious, and most skillful among the three. His Leopard boxing is marvelous. His braid can kill. They`re the parasites of the martial arts field. Sooner or later, l`ll use their heads as footballs. Brother Jin, you mentioned that three years ago you broke my master`s ribs. ls it true? You can ask him yourself. According to my master`s styles, there are three stances that can protect the chest. How did you break his ribs? Which three stances? Okay, watch carefully! Hanging high as a star. Flying light as a butterfly. Kicking hard as the top star. How`s that? What? Am l not skillful? You`re okay, but not good enough! What? Not good enough? You know these three stances have turned me into a strong man. Look! lf so, why don`t you work in the fields? You think l`m an ox? Ox? Well, you aren`t as big as that! What then, you mean l`m puny? l can see that you`re like a Mongol doctor! Sick or well, it`s up to you. Let me show you! Come! Okay. Mongol doctor, eh? l`ll give you a checkup! l`m coming! Left punch! Right punch! Wah! Really fierce! That`s nothing! Want to know how l defeated you? Of course! Then come again! Hanging high as a star! And the second one? Flying light as a butterfly! Kicking hard as the top star! Shi Zhengzong has led the young one astray! Even if you study all your life, all you`ll learn is fancy boxing and some kicks. Brother Jin, can l learn from you? You want to betray your school? Not really. Betraying one`s own school is a serious violation in martial arts. l don`t want to be called a traitor! You do have character. Character? lf l had that l wouldn`t stay here and be bullied! You really wish to learn from me? Of course, but then l don`t want to be a traitor. That`s easy. l`ll teach you secretly then nobody will know. Brother Jin, when can we start? Tomorrow! l`ll show you what real martial arts is all about! Boxing has four types: fist, palm, claw and hook. These are founded on four bases: kick, strike, wrestle and hold. There are three don`ts when practicing boxing! Don`t act on impulse! Don`t rush! Don`t be vain! lmpulse will break the energy. Vanity will loosen the energy. By being hasty you`ll have sloppy potential. Boxing is also about coordination of the eye, the hand and the body. Speed is a critical element. Especially the eyes have to be keen. ln Chinese boxing there are some ambiguous elements. One must learn to balance them, thereby testing your opponent. You have to know all that to win. What l`m showing you now is close range. At the time of actual wrestling, gather your power and attack at short range. lt is indeed very powerful! That`s called Extreme fist. Very agile! Can you do that? Piece of cake! Excuse me! Watch me! Sometimes even cake can make one choke. Take your time! lf it were simple, everyone would be a master. You broke it? Yes, my head! Did you find Jin Tianyun? Couldn`t find him anywhere! Chief, do you think he has left this Phoenix town? That`s impossible. He`s wounded. He can`t go far! Keep searching! Brother Jin, how`s that? Not bad? Very powerful. lt`s actually more than that. lt`s extremely powerful from head to toe! See, it`s more broken than a broken body! Don`t be so proud! To learn the essence of close range, you have to practice more and harder. How?. l`ll tell you later! Have you memorized the rules of the sword? Getting there. l`ve been studying all night! Tomorrow l`ll teach you the way of the sword. The sword is listed as the top of all short weapons. lt has two blades and a ridge in the middle. The blade will break if hit by hard material. The essence of the sword is at the edge so all attention is being put there. The art of the sword is also based on that. The perfect use of the sword hilt is not only an art by itself but can also be used to confuse the enemy`s vision. lt helps in your attack! Brother Jin, how come these tiles are so hard to break? Because you are not concentrating enough! Just watch! First, clear your mind, and concentrate. Brother Jin, you`re amazing! Remember, haste brings no success. Haste could also cause you injury and turn you into a moron. Thanks for the lesson! Brother Jin, you haven`t recovered yet! But we ran out of money, what should we do? Don`t worry, the fortune teller said l will live up to ninety years. ls that true? How do l know? You can ask the blind fortune teller yourself! What? Blind? He told your fortune in darkness? l think you should get into your room first. l`ll get money from Master to get you medicine. Hey, Gao! What? Jin Tianyun is dead? Yes, l heard he was killed by the Three Devils. These Three Devils are pure evil. Ever since they killed him, their morale is boosted. Don`t know why they have stayed here the past few months? What`s more, a few days ago they beat up Master Qin`s apprentices for no reason at all! Nonsense! lf they keep on causing trouble, l`ll teach them a good lesson! That`s why we are here. We hope you can uphold justice. Yes! The three of them are very skillful! Master, what should we do? Should we hire some more men to help? ln order to eradicate these kind of dregs, it`s good to have some more men. Do you know where the Three Devils are now? We`re not sure about that, but we`ve heard Zhou Sanzhao spent all the money he stole at Yihong Brothel every night. The money was spent as fast as flowing water! Yihong Brothel? l must get that ill-gotten money. l want to suck your dates! My lord, aren`t you wasting this good wine? What a pity. Not at all! Nothing like Chinese dates soaked in wine. lt`s like paradise! Such a big man and he`s still drinking breast milk? Looks like it`s so pleasurable. Look at the way he waggles his tongue. How heavenly! This is so embarrassing! What`s so embarrassing about that? Don`t bother if you`re broke. This is so wonderful! Master Zhou, you`ve had your fun! Let`s play the money game, how`s that? Good! Come! Come! All of you! Let`s get everybody out! These are all for you! Coming! Coming! Only those fast enough will get a reward! Let`s start the game! You can have it if you catch it; lf you drop it, it`s not yours! You dropped it! Stupid! Next! You`d better catch some for me! What are you doing here? Back of the line! Go! Line up! Line up! Shut up! You`re all useless! l`m so mad! Next! Put your hands down! lt`s so embarrassing! Like a piece of cardboard! She hasn`t had enough nutrition! Even though her breasts are a bit flat, she`s actually good-looking when you take a closer look. Throw it at her! lt`ll be funny! Really? Thanks, Master Zhou! Master Zhou, keep on playing! Thanks Master Zhou, thank you! She got it again! Throw at her, quick! Master Zhou, come on! Stop! Get away! Get away! Are you blind? Sorry, sorry! Open the door! Boss! Open the door! What`re you doing here in the middle of night? You want to break into my shop? l`m sorry, Boss, l need 10 grams of Tianqi, 50 grams of Baiyao, also... Are you mad? Do you know what time it is? Come back tomorrow! Please help. lt`s a matter of life and death. lt`s not my business! l need to sleep! You can`t sleep, Boss! Asshole, no sympathy at all! All you want is sleep! You can sleep as much as you want after you die! What are you looking at? Get lost! Asshole! l`ll make it hard for you to sleep! Sleep! l`ll let you sleep! Son of a bitch! Sleep! Since you like to sleep! Damn it. Sleep! l`ll let you sleep! What are you doing? The gold is mine! lt has the word ``Three`` engraved on it. Doesn`t this belong to Zhou Sanzhao? So you know Zhou Sanzhao? Don`t get me wrong! l didn`t steal it. Zhou Sanzhao gave it to me of his own accord. Gave it to you? lt`s true, you don`t believe me? Grab him! Hey, don`t move! You really want to fight? Kid, you do know some kung fu! This kid must be the apprentice of Zhou Sanzhao. We`ll take him to Thunderstorm! Wait, Thunderstorm is my master! How come he has an apprentice like you? Who`s that? Who are you looking for? Master Shi. Master! Help! Get me out! Master Shi. We`ve got hold of Zhou`s apprentice. We`ll let you handle this. Good! This bastard, let me question him! Take a seat, Master! Help! Let me out! Master, it`s me! lt`s Gao Jian! Gao Jian, what happened? Master, l...they... What exactly happened? Master, these three assholes, l told them l was your apprentice, but they ignored... Look at you. What do you look like now?. Master, l think he looks like a lily. You all think so, too? Shut up! Shut up! Master Shi, we found Zhou Sanzhao`s gold ingot on him. This is indeed strange! We hope you can clear things up for us! The gold ingot is engraved with the word ``Three``! Yes, ``Three``! ``Three`` is on it! Where did you get this? Zhou Sanzhao gave it to me. What? Zhou Sanzhao is a notorious murderer. Why would he give you money? That`s right! He didn`t really give it to me. l... Master, he`s lying again. Yes! He`s lying again! Where did you get the money? Gao Jian, tell Dad the truth! Quick, otherwise Master will punish you! Zhou Sanzhao threw money at the prostitutes so l dressed up as a woman and got his money. Dressed up as a prostitute? What a good idea! Yes, yes, he does look like a woman! Your apprentice is smart. He will have a bright future. Enough! Just now it was only me against you all! Now my master is here. Let`s fight if you dare! Gao Jian. Not bad! That`s my master`s teaching! Dad! You want to drive me mad? Dad! What do you know about kung fu? Talk about fighting? You deserve it! You! l`m sorry, l should have taught him better! l`ll teach him a good and harsh lesson. Master Shi, please take it easy! Gentlemen, please have a seat inside. Serve the guests! Master! lt`s the third day now! l won`t live long even if l survive this. Don`t be such a cry-baby! More hardship is coming! lt`s bad luck! ln fact, you can take the punishment as a form of practice. lt`s not only horse stance that l`m having! What else? A stomach stance! You need to stand up like a man! Yeah, right! My eyes are still standing! Let me show you! Air flows into the stomach! Energy flows from the abdomen! Brother Jin, what is that? This is the art of utilizing the vital energy. lt can loosen stiff joints and help blood flow! lf you follow the instruction! Not only horse stance but you can also stand up to any stance! Air flows into the stomach! Energy flows from the abdomen! Eyes closed as the energy gathers! Left and right and left and right! A thousand pounds and l`m still all right! Left and right and left and right! A thousand pounds and l`m still all right! lt`s too light! Looks like he gives a damn! Get into position! Make a proper horse stance! Or stomach stance! Do it! Higher! Oh! Third Brother, what are you doing? You asshole! Third Brother, Jian is already serving his punishment. Why are you beating him up? He...oh, my foot! Poor foot! What? Brother Jin... you`ll be leaving tomorrow?. Yes! During the past three months... l`ve already taught you all that l know. As long as you practice hard, a year later... you`ll be another Jin Tianyun. Brother Jin, you have not recovered yet. Those gangs are still looking for you. Until they find my body they will not give up! Sooner or later they will be here! l know, you`re afraid of involving me. Brother Jin, we`re good brothers. We should share bliss and misfortune together. Gao, nothing lasts forever! l`ll come see you in a year! Well... Brother Jin, until then l`ll take good care of you! Like the rice of original taste? Daixiong, give it a try! Me! Yes, Master! Got it! Okay, okay! Ying Chang, it`s your turn! Me? No way! Third Brother, if you don`t want to learn from Dad, you can leave! l didn`t mean that! Then go practice! All right! Master, which stance? Whichever! Go, go! l`ll die if l have to! You still have a lot to learn. Keep practicing! Yes, Master! Gao Jian, are you here to learn martial arts? Master, l don`t think he`s learned anything! But even if l did so, it`s useless! Useless? Master, he looks down on our school! Don`t make things up! Come here! Gao Jian, how long have you been learning here? About three years! So you should know the stances you`ve just seen. Could you demonstrate? Master! l bet you can`t manage even one. One stance and he`s finished! Master, please! See? He`s useless! Master, observe! Gao Jian, where did you learn that? l...l made it up! Fine, show me some more! Please! Master, the ``flying light as a butterfly`` strikes from the top and bottom, but the middle part is unprotected. lt`ll be an easy target! Master, he`s right! Seems like he`s not bad. What did you say? Master forgot his glasses! No wonder you can`t win over him! Dad! l`m sorry, Master! Master`s technique is good. But now he can`t even stand still. He was defeated in at least six or seven stances. He picked up a brick! A brick? You bastard! Master! Stay there! Don`t run! lt`s me! Master, stop it! Stop it! You bastard! How dare you beat me up! l didn`t mean it! Didn`t mean it? But you punched Master so hard? lt was just a mistake! Mistake? lt was more than one time. No! Master just couldn`t take it! Dad! Tell me, who taught you those stances? l...l..! l taught him! Jin Tianyun! Master Shi, it`s been three years since we last met! Your temper is still bad, l see. Brother Jin, how come you`re still here? l was afraid that you`d be bullied again so l came back! Jin Tianyun, you taught my apprentice in secret. This is definitely against ethics! Ethics? Don`t complicate things. Your apprentice saved my life so l taught him as a way to say thanks! Why are you so mean? That`s true, Master. ln fact, it`s good to learn more! You traitor, you`ve betrayed our teachings and our school. l`ll kill you! Shi Zhengzong, ``the decent school`` talks about loving and helping the younger generation! But you blame your apprentice and even beat him up... in order to keep your pride. lf you try to give him a hard time again, l`ll interfere. Jin Tianyun, l know how to teach my pupils! This is none of your business! You like to yell! You want me to break your ribs again? Brother Jin, you`ve not recovered yet! Just leave here, quickly! You`re wounded! lf l fight with you, people will say l`ve taken undue advantage. lt`ll ruin my reputation! Ying Chang, Wei Kun and Daixiong come here! Yes, Master? Yes, Master? Go have a match with Master Jin! Me? You wouldn`t want to tarnish my reputation, would you? Move! Go! Go! Keep going! Keep going! Keep going! What`s wrong with you? Get him! Master, he`s wounded, please stop it! Master! Master... Dad! Master, he`s running away! l`m sorry, Master! You traitor, hang him up! Jin Tianyun, l thought you`d flown away! Finally, we meet again! Don`t think you can get away this time! Fan San, get him! No! Let me get him! Big Brother! Jin Tianyun, l`ll get you this time! Master, Gao Jian is young and ignorant. Please forgive him this once! Dad, you`ve already hung him up for a whole day. Let me release him! Stop! Betraying one`s school is a serious violation. This bastard, l`ll teach him a good lesson. Dad! You don`t need to beg me on his behalf! l`ve invited some leaders here to discuss how to get rid of the Three Devils. l`ll also take this chance to reform our school! Reform our school? Master, you mean... l`ll abolish all his vital energy in front of everybody. And show the world my sense of justice! Dad! Dad! l`m so itchy! Third Brother, l need some water. l`m so thirsty. Third Brother! l need some water! Third Brother! Quick, l need water! Third Brother, Third Brother.... What? Better make your last wish fast! l`m so thirsty! Give me some water! Water, sure! Let me give you the best water in the world! lt`ll surely soothe you! Come down! l`m hung up here. lf you don`t let me down, how can l drink? lt`s my fault again, eh? No, l didn`t mean that! Never mind, let me do it! How`s that? Taste good? Well, the taste is a bit strange! That`s the water l`ve just used to wash my feet! Drink some more! No! lt`s good for your body! Gao Jian! Big Brother! Go! Master wants to abolish your vital energy! What? Abolish my vital energy? Today we have all the heroes from near and far. l appreciate all your bravery and uprightness! lt`s our honor to answer your call! We are more than willing to obey! Thank you! Thank you! As long as we can get rid of the Three Devils please use us as you see fit! Yes, yes! May we have your good idea? l won`t dare! Please take your seat! Everybody knows that Yan Qingwang, Zhou Sanzhao and Fan San are the parasites of our martial arts. They are here to stir things up! Yan Qingwang, why are you killing my pupils? Zhengzong, l hear you got some men here to discuss how to get rid of us! So we came on our own to see how good you are! Good! Since you saved us the effort of searching for you, l`ll give you what you desire. Come on! You`ve only taught your apprentices how to get beaten! l think the words ``Decent School`` of martial arts needs to be corrected! To what? To ``Deceased School``! Three Devils, that`s going too far! Fight! l said FlGHT! Master, l can`t! My head is wounded! My eyes are swollen! Big Brother, you`re the best, you go! Shi Zhengzong, it`s your turn! Dad! Master! Big Brother! Dad! Stop! Shi Zhengzong, you know the winner is King, right? What else have you to say? Your name, Thunderstorm, does mean something in the martial arts field. We think your place is indeed good shelter for us! l can`t even get enough sleep! l`ve told you a million times! You have to hurry up! The customers are coming! l`m working now! You keep yelling at me day and night! Do you think you`re my dad? Look at you, are you a thief at night? Thief? lf so, would l be working here? And work like a horse? What are you mumbling about? What did you say? Nothing! lf you don`t like it here, you`re free to leave. Boss, look at your restaurant! lt`s as big as a market, but l`m the only staff here! Why don`t you hire one more helper? What did you say? Who`s gonna pay for that? You`re so ungrateful! lf it wasn`t for me who pitied you last year... and kept you here, you`d have starved to death. Yes, oh yes! Thanks Mr. Boss! Work fast! Can`t take criticism? He even talks back to me! Did you light the fire in the stove yet? Light the fire? You lazy bum! That`s why l woke you up early! You`re so forgetful! l`ll beat you up! You good-for-nothing, how dare you run! Chase me! How dare you run? l`ll beat you up, you can`t remember a thing! Where is he? Where is he? He was here just now! You`ll be dead if l catch you! This is such a small place! Where can he hide? l`m here! You bastard, you bastard! l`m so mad! Gao, how come you`re so slow?. l`m coming! Coming! You will have it for sure! Yes, l`ll be right there! Gentlemen, enjoy it! Coming! That way, please! Gentlemen, have some tea! May l take your order? Whatever is good here, we`ll take it! Yes, the food will be right here! Hurry up! Just get whatever! Anyway, we can eat as much as we want when we get to Thunderstorm`s place! What`s the rush? Brother Yan is really smart! He turned Thunderstorm`s place into his own base camp! What about Shi Zhengzong? That coward! Of course he doesn`t dare fight back! Come, a toast! What happened? You messed up again! My clothes are all wet! Stupid! Take care of the other customers immediately! Waiter! Stupid! Someone`s calling you over there! Gentlemen, what would you like? Get our dishes quick! Okay, coming! How come Brother Yan stays at Thunderstorm`s place? None of your bloody business! Stupid! You messed up again? l`ll give you a good beating! You hit me? Get the dishes, right? l`ll go! Waiter! Waiter! Waiter! We`ve been waiting for ages! We won`t come again! Thank you! Thank you! Gao knows nothing but how to mess up! Waiter, waiter! Yes, what do you want? Refill the teapot! Yes! There`s no water! What are you doing? l`m sorry, coming soon! Boss, why do you have to do it yourself? You asshole! Where were you hiding? l`ll beat you up! Watch the teapot! l don`t need your advice! l`m telling you... Take off, right? Okay, l`ll take your word! Why are you pulling me now? Gao, are you really leaving? Yes! But keep this in mind. lt`s me who fired you, not vice versa! Oh, you asshole! Hey, is there some gold on the road? lt`s you again! Stay calm! l just want to ask you something. Mind your head! Oh, you two are killing each other? Who exactly is your Brother Yan? Yan Qingwang! How come he`s staying with Thunderstorm? Tell me! All right, all right! l`ll tell you! Brother Jin was killed! Yes, after Yan Qingwang killed Jin Tianyun, he stayed at Thunderstorm`s house! Dad! Second Brother, Second Brother! Second Brother, don`t you recognize me? l`m the one who is always bullied by you - Gao Jian! Oh, it`s you! How come you`re here? `Cause l miss you all! How is Master? lt isn`t good to talk here.
