Hey, it's me, Edith. We're right outside Anita's place. We came to collect the auctioned items, but they're taking away Anita's things. - What should we do? - They may be throwing them out. I'll take a picture and show you. They're leaving. What should we do? Get a taxi and follow. - Here! - Taxi. Follow that truck. I think they really are throwing her things away. But I'm at a meeting. I can only come later. Okay, then come after work. Bye. Hurry! Excuse me. - Wait! - Can you give these to us? Give them to you? You mean these? - Yes. - Hey! That's against regulations. Well, there's nothing I can do then. - Hey! - Hey! Let's get more people here. - Okay. - Okay. - Come quickly. - Here. - Quickly. - Hurry. Quick. Go there and look out for us. - Okay. - Be careful. Hey, these really are Anita's things. Hurry. Yes, these belonged to her. And these. My letter. Don't look at it now. - There are two cops coming. - Hurry! - Quick! - Be careful. Let's go. It's almost time. Watch out. - Quick! Let's go! - Let's go! The morning shift is almost over. Let's go, there's nothing there. Careful. Hey, they poured red paint all over. Do we still want these? Yes. It's so dirty. Who poured the red paint? Must be the junk shop to stop anyone from taking them. A few bags are missing. That junk store must have taken them. Excuse me. We came early to buy the things from last night. We're worried they'd be gone if we came later. Last night's things? The things from the dumpster. Hey. There they are. These two bags? Do you really have to come this early for these junks? I recognize you. You were going through the rubbish on the street last night. These aren't rubbish. To us, they are very precious. Anita Mui fans? She's at peace now. Stop this nonsense. You might get arrested. The most important thing is saving Anita's things. We want to buy these two bags. How much? You guys are really determined. Just like when I was young. That is just junk, just take them for free. No. You have a store to maintain. Well, okay. Give me 300 dollars then. - Okay. - Sure. Thank you, sir. - You're welcome. - Let's go. Such dedicated fans. MUI FANS ASSOCIATION I want to give something to you. I think you will be surprised. Anita reads Jin Yong's books? She's only interested in the romance parts. Did you find out who it was from? I don't know. Is this that fan we know? There's even a script. It's a musical. Let me see. THE HONG KONG SPIRIT, SCHOOL DRAMA SCRIPT Could it be that Perry we met when we went to see that play? I don't know. - Perry from Fuzhou Primary School? - I am. Someone is looking for you. Come on, put this on yourself. Everyone, check your costumes and props. - I'll be right back. - Okay. Are you looking for me? - Are you Perry? - I am. I'm Edith. I've seen your play before. I'm so happy you chose Anita as your topic. I really like Anita. Actually, I came to see if this script belongs to you. THE HONG KONG SPIRIT, SCHOOL DRAMA SCRIPT Anita succeeded because of her hard work and continuous creativity. She started singing at the age of four. She sang for her dreams and for her family. From singing at the amusement park to the Hong Kong Coliseum, and eventually, to different parts of the world. This is precisely the definition of the Hong Kong spirit. I hope to use drama as a teaching tool to enable students to learn persistence and perseverance through performing Anita's story. Perry. You can use drama as a teaching tool to allow the students to live the situation. That is a very good idea. However, using a pop star as their topic of study is a little problematic. Think about this. When you actually have to do this, you will need to spend extra time and energy to convince schools and parents. Since there is a bit of time left, I suggest you change your topic. - But Professor, I really feel that... - Perry. Think of your future. TO ANITA MUI THE HONG KONG SPIRIT, SCHOOL DRAMA SCRIPT Is it Hideki? Yes. Come on in. Hi, Edith. I'm sorry to make you come all this way. It's all right. Just sign this. Thank you. You still have so much you need to return. Yes. No way... - Hideki. - Mom. This is my colleague, Edith. Hi, there is something I want to return to you. Do you remember this? Why do you have these? Hideki! Everyone, ready. Go! Hideki! Hideki! Hideki... Remember, we have to shout it out at the same time. So Hideki will know we are fans from Hong Kong. - Okay. - Yes. We have banners, whistles, and presents for Hideki. But we still need to take pictures. How can we carry so much stuff? I got it. Look, we can do it like this. Right, we can put everything into the bag. That's brilliant. Anita, your mind's really quick. You must be really good at school. Forget about that. Come on, sign this. It's for Hideki. - Okay. - Sure. Don't you think our tour guide is handsome? Seems like you really like handsome guys. Of course, our idol is also a handsome guy. What do you guys do for a living? I'm still studying. First year at Hong Kong University. That's impressive. I work in accounts. I work for an international trading company. I work in logistics. I like to sort out ship timetables. What about you, Anita? I sing for a living at a nightclub. You do what for a living? Singing. A bandana for each of us. Try it on. Anita was really fun. She suddenly took out these bandanas and made us try them on for her to see. - So cute. - We even took a picture wearing them. She said that this is the way to make Hong Kong fans stand out - Hurry! - and get noticed. How many people? Do you have a reservation? We're here to support Anita. She said she reserved a table for us. Here. What would you like to drink? When is she on? She's getting ready backstage. She'll be on next. Why don't I take your orders first? We'll just have sodas. - Coke, please. - Same. Green Spot, please. Same. Four sodas. What's with the girls? They said they're here to support Anita. Eyes demure And bashful Seductive as flowers Soft as willow That was the first time I heard her sing. She sang so much better than a lot of singers. Four fruit punches from Anita. We will bring some nuts and chips in a minute. People will fade away Just as flowers will wilt A never-ending pain In my heart Thank you. See you later. If this doesn't belong to you, please return to Edith. Thank you for helping me... Thank you for helping me... -Happy birthday to you -Happy birthday to you -Happy birthday to you -Happy birthday to you -Happy birthday -Happy birthday -Happy birthday to you -Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Let's cut the cake. Dad, how was that? You think I'm getting better? It's not just about playing better than me. I know. I need to get into the music school in the US. Yes, so you better practice more. You have our full support. Blow the candle. You've been coughing for days. You need to see a doctor. Just give me something for the flu. No, there's a very strong flu going around. See a doctor. I am very strong. I'm not going to get that flu. I'll go with you. So Mom doesn't have to worry. - You need to go. - Okay. - Blow the candle. - All right. Let me make a wish first. HAPPY BIRTHDAY, DAD This is a hospital. You should wear a mask. Thank you. Dad, what did the doctor say? We're not sure at the moment. He will need to stay for observation. But family members can't come along for the moment. I'll be fine. They'll call you if there is anything. Your interview is coming soon. Go home and practice. Tell Mom there's nothing to worry about. Today, 7 more patients died with the total number of deaths reaching 47, the youngest being a 49-year-old male with others aged between 67 and 95. You've finished? Mom, you need to eat before you take medicine. Have some vegetables. It's been a week. There hasn't been any news about your dad. Could he really have gotten SARS? Mom, stop scaring yourself. Mrs. Chan upstairs has already recovered and gone home. Dad is going to be fine. Don't worry. Come on, eat something. Anita visited a supermarket today to encourage donations to Project Blossom, attracting scores of reporters, with the public coming out in force to support the cause. Anita. Anita. Thank you for attending today's press conference for the 1:99 Concert. In the past few days, we've had rain. We've had clouds. But today, we have the sun. That means our adversity is coming to an end. Do you want to take a break? I'm okay. You have the interview for the US music school in a few days. You need to focus. Just play like how you usually play. Relax. Do you have any news about your dad? It's been over a week. Still nothing. He would want you to do well. Come on. More on your index finger. Relax. Okay. Relax. Anita, are you done dancing? Come and eat something. Your chicken wings are ready. Look at her. Bet she hasn't had this much fun in a very long time. - Seriously. - You're amazing. - You got such a big place to hang out. - Right. My uncle went back to China and told me to look after this place, so I thought we would have a barbecue party. - Great! - Awesome! That means tonight, we have total freedom. I've tidied the room inside. After the barbecue, - we can tell ghost stories. - Nice! Not you. Don't you have to work tonight? You want to skip work? Just you wait. This is delicious. I really can't leave the house. - Must have been something I ate. - Don't do that. It's hurting really bad. - What's wrong? - That's right. - Anita was very excited that night. - It really hurts. She never had a barbecue party - with friends before. - It really hurts. - I'm going to die. - When she called the nightclub to take a sick leave, - her expressions were so dramatic. - I'm about to burst. We joked that she could win - the best actress award. - I can't make it. Even back then, this crazy girl - already had a great gift for acting. - Please, Boss. - Here to see Anita again? - Yes. She's not here yet. Come sit down and wait for her. Thank you. You're very close to her. I guess so. She likes to drink Coke. You know that? Well, you're such good friends. You must like Coke as well. Thank you. Did she tell you she entered this singing contest? Does she really think these contests are fair? That the best singer really wins? It's not like that. It's all fixed. Even if she's lucky enough to get into the finals, there will be costume fittings. She'll need to meet the reporters and do rehearsals. Things will be so crazy she won't have time to work here anymore. Do you know how much I pay her each month? She doesn't sing, she doesn't get paid. She's worked here for a while. A lot of people come to hear her sing. If she's not here for a few weeks, people will just forget her. Why would she want that? No. I think it's good to try. If I could sing like her, I would enter. It's pointless talking to you. Mr. Qiao. Listen to the advice of an old man. Thank you for speaking up for me. He's been nagging me for days. Don't get worked up. I know you like reading, but you don't have time to borrow them. I've taken some out for you. If you don't have time to return them, I'll return them for you. You're definitely the best to me. Have this. I'm going to change. It's okay, I'm not thirsty. I never understood why Anita liked to drink Coke. I always thought sugary drinks were bad for the throat. Maybe she felt there was too much bitterness in life and she needed some sweetness to balance it out. Arriving with the wind You breezed into my heart Changing my life in an instant No matter how much effort I put in You want to go sing as well? But I no longer fear the rain or wind Let the wind blow Anita's vocals and stage presence were like a magnet. I've been totally captivated ever since that night. Let the wind blow Take all the sadness away Whatever she said or did influenced everything I did. Excuse me. Is that poster for sale? Yes. It's so beautiful. A fan of Anita? Of course. There's no other singer in Hong Kong like her. Each album has a different image. She can sing any style of song. And not to mention her stage presence. She's just spectacular. I've always been a very introverted person. But Anita changed me completely. You really don't remember me? I was your classmate from school. I sat next to you for a whole year. You said more to me today than in that whole year. You're much more outgoing now. Really? Anita had gradually changed me. Growing up, I was always alone. I had no friends. I never joined any after-school activities. In my world, there was only loneliness and fear of people. I never knew what it was like to have friends. Hey. It's Samuel. I'll be back in Hong Kong tomorrow evening. Are we meeting Anita? Yes, I'll wait for you at the hotel car park. Remember to bring that picture you took of me and Anita. I want to have her autograph it. Yes, I will. Be safe. - Bye. - Bye. Edith, did you see the news today? No, why? Something happened to Samuel and his family. Why? - Anita! - She's here! Been here waiting for a long time? It's worth it if we could see you. - That's right. - Really? How do you know each other? Because of you. - That's right. - Years ago, I also made a few great friends because of Hideki. Cherish each other. - We will. - We will. Are you okay? You seem a bit odd today. Anita, do you know him? He's one of your fans. His name is Samuel. He came back from the US last year to attend your birthday party. He was supposed to arrive today and was going to come and see you here. But the news said he died. Anita, we have to go. One of my fans just died! Someone just died! Wait. How did this happen? There was some sort of accident. His whole family died. Can I have this photo? I want to pray for him tonight. Don't be too upset. If you need my help, just call my assistant. Don't be afraid to ask. We really have to go. Okay, I know. - Is this for me? - Yes. This is for you. Take care of yourselves. - Okay. - Sure. - Bye. - Bye, Anita. Thank you for coming into my life. You enabled me to learn how to trust and make friends and not to worry about the outcome. Because that is the way to live without regrets. Thank you. Edith. Why do you want to apply for the post of trainee artists' assistant? Because I'm a huge fan of Anita Mui. I remember whenever I wanted to get her autograph or picture, I was always stopped by the assistants. So I really hated them. But then I thought, what type of person would be able to get close to artists without being stopped? That would be the assistants. So I want to become an assistant. But Anita is not with our company. I did my research. Your artists collaborate with Anita the most. Her company wouldn't hire me, so I applied here. Why do you like Anita so much? What is it about her that attracts you? Why is this scene taking so long? I don't know. It's so late already. We should just go. Okay. Who knows when they'll finish filming. Let's go. Little girl, you're not leaving? There's no way I'm leaving. I don't have school tomorrow, so I don't need to wake up early. But the buses going back to town will stop soon. It's okay, I'll find a way. I have to see Anita tonight. Would you be okay by yourself? I'll be okay. You should leave. The last bus is leaving soon. - All right. Bye. - Bye. That's a wrap for Anita. What are you doing here? I'm waiting for Anita. She's changing now. It's already so late. Yes. Are you the only one left? There were more people, but they had to catch the last bus. How are you getting home then? I can take a bus at the bottom of the hill. How are you going to get down? Can I borrow your phone, so I can call a taxi? Don't be crazy, there's no need. Get in Anita's car. Anita is changing now. She said she'll give you a lift. Go. Sit there. Anita sits facing backward? She's used to it. Why? She wants to let the chasing fans see her face. Get in. What's your name? I'm Kiki. What year are you in? I'm in Form 4. So you're only 15? Have you done your homework? I did it while I was waiting for you. Seriously? I have a present for you. I made this picture frame in art class. Does your family know where you are? I told them I went to a classmate's home to do our homework. Don't come out so late again. I know how to manage my time. Everyone has their own interests. Some like to play video games, some like to plant flowers. I like coming to see you. I'm even more motivated to study after I see you. Then you need to study even harder and get into university. Come and see me when you have your graduation certificate. But that's so long. No buts. Promise. I finally graduated this year. I did what I promised her, so now I can follow her all the time. I appreciate your honesty. We are touched by your sincerity. We'll hire you. Really? Bring the passion you have for Anita to our company. Thank you so much. Yes. Yes! - Hello. - Are you Lam Ka-chen's family? Yes. Please come immediately to the hospital. Okay. Thank you. Dad, hang in there! Wake up, Dad. Dad, you need to get well. You have to come and see me perform after I graduate. Dad, wake up! Dad! How did your interview go? When will you know the result? I'm not going to the US anymore. I didn't go to the interview. Dad didn't leave us much money. I want to start working as soon as possible. You don't have to worry about money. I don't need that much to live on. We have enough for your studies. I don't want you to suffer. And your health isn't good. I will be fine. You know that you studying music abroad was your dad's greatest wish. Things are different now. Precisely because things are different now you cannot let him down! I'm an adult. I'll make my own decision. ONLINE SECONDHAND STORE YOU HAVE A MESSAGE Ken. Hello. Mr. Jun? You arranged to meet me. I'm buying the guitar. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have done it. All my student grant applications have been rejected. You know my family's situation. I just have to face reality. I totally understand. Have you heard of Anita Mui's 1:99 benefit concert? The concert was to raise money for families affected by SARS. I spoke with a social worker. They have a fund. You should apply for it. Forget it. I didn't even go to the interview. The school understands your situation. They will allow you to make a late submission. My best music partner is gone. What's the point in studying music? - Mr. Perry! - Mr. Perry! Good morning. Have you finished your summer holiday homework? - Of course. - That's good. What about you, Mr. Perry? No, I haven't. I'm only starting tonight. Do teachers need to do homework too? All right now, go queue at the playground. Good morning, Luna. - What did you do during summer? - I joined a singing class. Was it fun? Yes, but summer is over now. It doesn't matter. We still have music lessons. We can sing. Go queue at the playground. Mr. Perry, how long have you been teaching at our school? Eight years. What do you think of our school? Let me put it this way. If our school is to become the best in the area, what do you think we are lacking? Art? Exactly, I want us to compete in this competition. As you said, I want to enhance art education in our school. I heard from other teachers that you take part in amateur theater productions. Yes. So you have experience with theater. Why don't I put you in charge of this? - Great. - As for the topic, I'm thinking Shakespeare for the students. I go to school drama festivals every year. A lot of schools perform translated foreign language plays. And it seems that the students don't really know what they're doing. But what I did notice was that whenever schools do a Hong Kong-related topic, the students appear to be more engaged. What about the judges? I believe, like myself, they focus more on creativity and they like local topics as this connects with the audience. But it will take time to write a new script. I can write you a new script very soon. One week. The written statements will be on your desk by tomorrow morning. You don't need to worry when I'm in charge. What are you doing? Let me do it, you dumbass. Have you seen my script? What? A stack of papers. What is it for? I need to rehearse a play with the students. Teaching kids to do that? You can't make a living by acting. You'll just ruin their future. Don't be so dramatic. Without a proper job, there's no hope. Look at you. Weak and fragile. You can't lift anything. And you talk with that girly voice. There's nothing about you that is like a man. I'm sure it's because of all that theater stuff that made you like that. The principal wanted me to do it. You're a police officer. You have to work when you receive orders. I'm just the same as you. ANITA, THE WOMAN OF SONGS SCHOOL FESTIVAL SCRIPT THE DAUGHTER OF HONG KONG She was me That little girl was me Never would I have imagined That you would lavish me With such love "I am the grownup you. Today, many listened to my music. And I have many fans that love me. I have many of my own songs. I came here to thank you." Thank you, Olivia. You may return to your seat. Who's next? "Mui, we don't want you joining any of our afterschool activities. My dad says you're a showgirl. You look trashy with all that makeup." "Your name sounds like a stage name. We know you sing at Lai Chi Kok Amusement Park at night. You're a singer, so you don't want to play with us." "We're not going to play with you. Just go away. You don't have any friends." Good, thank you. You may return to your seats. Luna, you're up next. "I work at the amusement park as a showgirl." - Showgirl. - "I want my family to have a better life. This is my..." Mr. Perry, I don't know how to read this word. "Aspiration." What does aspiration mean? It means something you look forward to. Or to long for a better life in the future. "Aspiration"? "This is my aspiration. I dream that in the future, I will have a stage that belongs to me. I dream that my family will be able to live happily every day. I dream that I will have a lot of friends. And everyone will want to play with me. People must have dreams. I will hold on to that dream until the end." Hey, how's it going? It's almost done. But Mr. Lam, your questions this time were really tough. - A lot of the students failed. - I'm not talking about the test. I meant the drama competition. - Well, it's going really well. - That's good. Have this. You look terrible, so drink this. You need a boost. I was working late the past couple of nights. Don't put too much pressure on yourself. I know. But the principal has really high expectations. You can't lose - now that you've made it to the finals. - I know. But honestly, the kids are doing a really good job. You know something? I am in charge of the New Technology competition. I'm really stressed out as I only have half your budget. So you're doing a lot better than me. It's a shame some of the parents don't seem to agree. I guess asking the kids to act is like encouraging them to become pop stars. - You know it. - Mr. Lam, my point is... The main point is the principal fully supports you. So you don't need to worry. Thank you for reminding me. I'm done here and I have things to do. I have to go. Hey. The chicken essence. Save it for yourself. I'll just drink soymilk. Kiki, iron the outfit that Jimmy is wearing for the interview later. Sure, no problem. I heard one of your fans is now a reporter. That's perfect, I'll have one more person working for me. Should I ask which media she's working at? Of course. We have to make the best use of them. Hey, there are loads of fans waiting outside. Tell the driver to stop the car later. I want to meet them. What? Why do you want to meet them? Use your brain. I have a concert next month. Okay, no problem. Jimmy, I've spoken to the director. Just put this on and pose. All right, no problem. We have a long shoot today. Kiki, go make Jimmy a cup of coffee. Yes. Where are you going later? I'm going to Studio Two. Who is coming today? Anita Mui. I'm definitely visiting you later. You look like you've found gold. Excuse me, can I come and visit as well? The cape doesn't look good blowing like this. Here's your coffee, Ms. Na. Put it there. - Ms. Na, may I... - I have an idea, Director. Kiki, come over here. When the director says action, grab the cape and flap it really hard. - Actually, I want... - Don't stop until the director says so. Take off your shoes. All right, action. Flap it harder. Harder. Even harder. Good, the cape looks good. Watch it, you're in the shot. Okay, stop for a moment. Ms. Na. Thank you. Are you tired? Of course not. I can do this a few more times. Okay, let's do it again. - All right. - Flap it. All right, action. This pose is very cool. I'm leaving now, Ms. Na. - Okay, bye. - Bye. Jimmy. Should I put all these in the car? Are you kidding? Just throw them away. But your fans gave them to you. I don't have the time to keep this shit. None of this is worth anything. My house doesn't have the space for this junk. Just throw them away, okay? But look at this. They put a lot of thought and effort into it. - Look... - No. The celebrities are all like that. All of them. All of them? I've seen a lot. But he has a point. Does every star need to make room just to store all this? Don't be crazy. Just get on with work. Are these from the fans again? What a waste. Fans see these as presents, but the artists see them as trash. In the end, they all end up being mine. All right, give them to me. RESIGNATION LETTER Hello. - Kiki, where are you? - I'm at the office. Can't leave yet? I want to finish it off before I go. Come to Broadcast Drive now. Anita is doing an interview here. We're all waiting outside. Don't waste your time. It's pointless. Coming up next. Tonight, in the studio, we have Anita Mui. 20 years ago, she was the winner of the 1982 singing competition. James Wong said she was perfect that night and gave her full marks. But Joseph Koo gave her 99 because he said there's no perfection in art. So he deducted one mark. Since the beginning, Anita has always treasured her fans. Hi everyone, it's Anita. Sincerely, Wong Wing-kei - Hello. - Hello, Amy? Anita? How come you're free to call me? Aren't you singing at the nightclub? The nightclub? I've signed with the record company. I'm not allowed to sing at the nightclub ever again. What are you going to do? She told me she was a bit tight with money. She had moved out on her own. She wanted me to lend her some money for the next two months. It's not that I can't. But you know I don't get paid a lot and I need to support my family. I can lend you 300 dollars for now and another 300 dollars next month when I get paid. I'll transfer the money tomorrow. I'm really sorry to bother you. Since when have you become so dithering? Anita said someone even had to bring rice to her place and cook for her. She paid me back very soon. It's kind of funny thinking about it now. We all went to Japan to see Hideki not too long ago. But not long after that, she became an idol herself. But she never forgot us. She often asked us out and bought us dinner. She asked us to go shopping with her. She always ended up buying a lot of things for us and nothing for herself. We said we'd pay her back and she should be more frugal. But she said she could always earn the money back. You can't always make friends again. She told us not to fuss about it. We couldn't win an argument with her. - Let's drink. - Sure. - Cheers. - Cheers. Congratulations, Anita. Your album is selling really well. We have a present for you. Present? To celebrate the success of your album. SAIJO HIDEKI RECITAL It's nothing much, so we hope you don't mind. These are all our precious memories. This bandana. You said you left yours in the bathroom in Japan. So I'm making a sacrifice and giving mine to you. Thank you. Who is it? - Why are they calling now? - Shouldn't you return the call? It's nothing important. It must be the guys calling me out for drinks or a late-night supper. That's great. It means you have a lot of industry friends now. I don't have that many friends. They just want me to pay the bill. But I'm okay with it. Money is for spending anyway. And I like big parties. Now, I really need to return this call. Hey. Do you think those words were meant for us? I wouldn't be surprised. Anita is so famous now. I'm sure a lot of people just want to take advantage of her. Does she think we're one of them? I don't think so. We better keep a distance. In case people say we're taking advantage of her. Yes, there's no point waiting to have it said to our faces. I had a lot of pride growing up. I couldn't help but wonder. Why was Anita so nice to us? Was it because she didn't have any friends? Did she simply want people around when she was following her idol? Or was it because I spoke up for her before the singing contest? Was that why she's so nice to me? You're home. - Why are you so late? - Dad. I had to work extra hours. Someone named Anita called you a couple of times. You better call her back. It's all right, it's not necessary. Your friend sounded just like Anita Mui. Hello. It was Anita who called. She said there was a new Japanese restaurant opening and wanted to take us there. I'm really busy with work recently. I can't come out. Why is everyone busy with work? What a coincidence. You must be really busy now that you're so popular. You should rest whenever you can. I can rest when I see you guys. You're a superstar now. Hanging out with normal people like us just doesn't seem right. We should just be friends over the phone from now on. I think it's better this way. Plus, I really am very busy at work. And I need to plan my wedding. I really don't have time to come out. The soup is ready. My dad is calling for me. I can't talk anymore. It's getting late, you should rest. Don't stay up too late. Bye. Has anyone got any questions? If not... Sorry, I'm late. Where's Luna? Is she absent today? She came to school today. Why isn't she here at rehearsal? I don't know. Never mind. We'll start with you, Olivia. But my scene is with Luna. It's all right, I'll read her part. - Okay. - Let's begin. I am you. I am you after you've grown up. You are me? What will happen when I grow up? I didn't come to talk about this. Then what are you here for? I came to tell you... Excuse me, Mr. Perry. The principal wants to see you. Mrs. Cheung. Luna is the lead in this play. She is very important. And we're already halfway through rehearsals. It would really affect the production if we were to recast. But now you're affecting my daughter's studies. Spending the day fooling around, - when will she have time to study? - We're not fooling around. We hope that through this play, the students can learn how to express themselves. You're having my daughter play a showgirl who gave up on studying. I don't know what she can learn to express from that. Let's be honest. Anita Mui was just a pop star. I think it's ridiculous having her as a subject of learning. Principal, if you only want to boost the school's name yet completely neglect a student's personal growth, I'd be extremely disappointed. The focus is not on Anita Mui's pop star status. We are trying... My daughter is quitting. Mrs. Cheung. As the principal, I fully support Mr. Perry's bold project. But perhaps we didn't think things through enough. Okay, I accept your opinion. - We will change the cast. - But Principal, if... That's the final decision. Let's go, Luna. Wait. You want others to respect your opinion. Then who will respect Luna's opinion? What is that supposed to mean? Don't be afraid, Luna. Tell them, do you want to go on with the show? I remember there was once a little showgirl A tiny little girl I remember in the not too nice parts of town She sang some old tunes with a theatrical company The old theater was never full But she continued to perform to ease her hunger What are you doing? It's just some costumes. They're not for me. Of course I know they are not for you. I would kill myself if these were for you. Then why did you ask? Where's my cup? Your dad holds a gun on the frontline. And you're hiding in the house sewing. The neighbors would laugh at me if they ever found out. That's discrimination. What discrimination? It's normal for fathers to have high expectations for their sons. Sometimes, I wonder. Do I actually have a son? All you ever did was women's work. Have you heard of Mei Lanfang? He cross-dressed, and yet he's one of the most famous Peking opera masters. What master? Mei Lanfang? I've only heard of Anita Mui. Now, Anita is really cool. A man in a woman's clothes is a sissy. It's called art. I've been doing drama for so long. You never once came to see my shows. Do you even know what I'm doing? Look. I'm telling the story of Anita Mui this time. It teaches people to hold on to their dreams. It's really cool. This script is ten years old now. I almost forgot about it. But Anita kept it all this time. I never thought she would receive it. And I never thought she would keep it. Thank you so much. My students will be performing a new version tonight. What's different is I've written a few new parts and added in the adult Anita. - That... - Mr. Perry. Yes? Olivia has hurt herself. - Does it hurt? - What should we do? Let me see. Can you walk? - Be careful. - I twisted my ankle when I was going down the stairs. What should we do? THE HONG KONG SPIRIT, SCHOOL DRAMA SCRIPT Bravo. Absolutely fantastic. Who knew at such a young age they could perform with so much depth? It really captures one's attention. This year's judging is much tougher than last year. Because these are this year's rules. No outside help is allowed. It means teachers are not allowed to perform on stage. - Excuse me. - Nor are professional actors. THE HONG KONG SPIRIT, SCHOOL DRAMA All performers must be students. So this year, we can really see the students' efforts. Please enjoy the show. All right, coming up next. I'm really looking forward to this. Because they are telling the childhood story of a superstar. But who is this superstar? Without further ado, please welcome them on stage with a big round of applause. The Daughter of Hong Kong. I remember there was once a little showgirl A tiny little girl I remember in the not too nice parts of town She sang some old tunes with a theatrical company The old theater was never full But she continued to perform to ease her hunger The old costumes sparkled from afar But only up close did you see the worn-out holes I really like to sing. When I first sang for my uncle at home, I knew that I really liked to sing. When I realized my singing could help my family, I did not give up all the more. I can't remember things from books. But I'm really good at remembering lyrics. My classmates call me a showgirl. They won't play with me. But I will go on. Because I know I'll own that stage in the future. You will achieve that. She was me That little girl was me Never would I have imagined That you would lavish me With such love Who are you? I am the grownup you. Today, many listened to my music. And I have many fans that love me. I have many of my own songs. I came here to thank you. Thank me? Without your hard work and determination, there wouldn't be me today. My hard work and determination? Let me ask you this, why do you want to sing? Because of that elephant at Lai Chi Kok Amusement Park. My uncle takes me to feed the elephant every time before I sing. And also I want my family to live a better life. I want my mum to have a carefree life. As for me, I sing because I have a group of really loyal fans. I'm really going to miss this stage. Then don't go. Regardless of what the future holds, every step you take will shape who you become. What will happen to me next? Only you can determine your journey. Work hard no matter how difficult it gets. Because time will fly. We have to cherish every minute and every second. -Let me sing for you -Let me sing for you -Thank you for never abandoning -Thank you for never abandoning -When I am tired, when I am lost -When I am tired, when I am lost -Thank you for being my guide -Thank you for being my guide -If I could sing for you forever -If I could sing for you forever -That is all that I would need -That is all that I would need -Seeing you, I've found love -Seeing you, I've found love -I've found myself -I've found myself Thank you. That's my daughter. Mr. Perry. Principal. I'm really disappointed. I'm sorry. I know that teachers were not allowed to perform. And because of that, we were disqualified. I will take full responsibility. I mean, I'm really disappointed in those judges. We all saw what it was like when you were performing. To me, we're the winner. I'm proud of you. But we... I'm adding drama lessons starting next year. We will be focusing on local pop culture and will include this in our syllabus. The most important thing is to let students express themselves. And as adults, we need to listen patiently. I really want to thank you. I want to thank you too for giving me this opportunity. I'll see you next week. Let's go and eat something. You're buying. I never thought you would be the first to get married. You're dying to get married. What woman isn't dying to get married? Anita is dying to get married the most. Speaking of Anita, we haven't seen her in a while. But it's just the same seeing her on television. Amy. It's Anita's assistant. Hello. Ms. Mui asked me to come today. She knows you're getting married today. But she's appearing live on TV, so couldn't come. She told me to come to congratulate you. She said she'll buy you dinner next time. Anita is so thoughtful. I didn't even send her an invitation. Hello. Anita. You're downstairs? I'll come down as soon as I can. I haven't seen you in a while. You don't look too well. It's not easy being a housewife. Did you like the wedding bracelet I got you? What bracelet? The wedding present I gave you. I spent a lot of time picking it out. I didn't receive any presents. That woman... She only said she came to congratulate me on your behalf. Thinking about it now, Anita once asked me if I would be her assistant. I'm very glad I said no. I wouldn't have been able to deal with the people around her. We may have ended up not being friends. Thank you. I'm performing in the US and Canada next week. Take a few days off work and come take a break. It's almost time. I need to go to my part-time job. Excuse me, but I have to go now. You work a part-time job on a Sunday evening? My husband's business is having some financial problems, so I took a part-time job just to help out a bit. Don't worry, let me help you. I'll have someone send over a cheque tomorrow. You've helped me a lot before. Let me help you with this once. I really appreciate it. But I can deal with my own family's problems. I don't think we should see each other so often in the future. You're a superstar now. You shouldn't come to places like this. Don't come to see me anymore. What's wrong with coming here to see you? To be honest, being your friend... There's no way I can afford your lifestyle. With you being my friend, I can just pay for everything. Actually, don't you think it's better if we're just idol and fan? Please don't come anymore. Don't be like this. Our worlds are just too far apart. Take care. Why did you choose this song? Because this was the last song I played with my dad. He has always been my best partner. Your information is complete and nothing is missing. We've already reviewed your application. You are very perseverant. We have no further questions. Look at him. He came all this way carrying that big guitar. And it's a classical guitar. I don't know anything about it, but he sure played it well. I don't have any more questions, do you? Okay. Congratulations. We've accepted your application. Thank you, all. Thank you, Anita Mui. Have you eaten yet? I've been accepted. Look. Here is the confirmation letter from the US. Your dad would have been very happy. I believe we understand the importance of a father and mother to a child in a family. The message of this concert is to let the children know that they are not alone. Whether or not your parents are with you now or if they're at the hospital, you are not alone. Because there are a lot of people here to support you. I hope to bring this message to all the families in need. I hope they can feel that there is still warmth in this world. To Anita. Thank you for helping me through the darkest time of my life and enabling me to continue studying music. Although we have never met, my dad and I loved playing your music. I will work very hard. When I graduate, I promise I'll come and see you face to face to say thank you. Sometimes, it is just very difficult to see my friends. For those fair-weather friends, you'll see them when you're happy. They bring you joy and vice versa. You make each other happy. Then there are the friends you don't see very often. Sometimes, you just don't get to see your best friends often, but you know what each other is up to. I just need to say one word and they know what I want to say. You try to help solve their problems. They call you when they need help. They call you when they're upset. This is what best friends are like. Do you have a lot of these friends? Not many. But how many? Two or three. But to have two or three of this type of friend is more than I can ask for. Pedestrians and drivers should avoid using that road until the debris is cleaned. Hello. Do you have nylon strings? Yes. Pop singer, Anita Mui's condition worsened due to cervical cancer. - Is this okay? - Yes. She died at Hong Kong Sanatorium and Hospital at the age of 40. Anita is such a great person. It's a shame she died so young. Anita Mui's remains were sent to Hong Kong Funeral Home. The passing of Hong Kong's brightest star. Some of her fans brought along flowers to say their final goodbyes. Hello. Amy. Anita. I want to ask you to come out. You're a superstar. You have a lot of people around you. You don't need me. I'm dying. Can't you come out and see me? What are you talking about? You sound so energetic. Okay, I won't force you. I hope I'm still able to see you again. I did go to see her final concert. But I didn't tell her. I really wanted to visit her at the hospital. But I missed my chance. Anita, although you're gone, I will always be your fan. Our friendship will forever live in your music. A lot of people look up to you for work and talent. Did you have any idols when you were younger? Yes. But idols only exist in the daydreams of young girls. When you wake up, you'll forget everything. But dolls are different. They may not have any life, but they're always there to cheer you up. It's more lasting. Who was your idol growing up? I can't really remember. Kiki, someone is here to see you. Sorry for holding you up. - Thank you. Bye. - Thank you. You're the Edith I spoke with online? Yes. Take a look around and see what you want to order. Actually, I'm not here to order dolls. I have something to return to you. See if this is yours. Why do you have this? Perhaps it's fate. Where did you find this? It's a little complicated. You can say that I found it at Anita's home. I don't understand. She never threw it away? Anita always had a room where she kept all her fans' presents. Now that the house has been sold, all those deemed worthless were thrown out. In those people's eyes, these are just useless junks. We tried to retrieve as much as we could and returned them to the people who gave them to her. Was she crazy? She didn't throw it away. Anita never threw out the presents we gave her. But I threw her out. I threw her out a long time ago. What is wrong with that woman? Why would you keep my present? Kiki wanted to say sorry to Anita. But Anita would never stand in front of her again. All these items that should have ceased to exist, the forgotten pieces of rubbish... Back with the fans that gave them, each becomes a treasure. They embody the most precious love and memories, reminding us, no matter how difficult things get, we should never lose faith and our dreams. Coming up next will be my last song of this evening. But I would like to share a story before that. During the intermission, I received a letter. It's a letter I wrote ten years ago. I wrote it to a very important person. Without her, I wouldn't be performing for you tonight. All of you know her. Maybe you have seen her movies or listened to her music. Seeing this letter again today is her way of telling me that she has seen all my hard work over the years. I won't take for granted what she did for our society. I believe that when faced with difficulties, everyone wants someone there to help them. I was lucky to have her. Coming up. My last song. I want to dedicate this to my Daddy Long Legs, Anita Mui. Three meals and a roof, together as a pair Who will be that person? The ones that can't be together, the ones that pass by Are always the ones you long for From the wings you watch me Perform your desired act The carefree friend from the past Do you still remember? Joy, sorrow, sickness, and death Do not create fables Unable to bear the love and tenderness Isn't between me or you The world of the temporal and the boundless will of the gods Served to drive us apart Heartbreaking words, the howling of wind and rain Signal the arrival of an old friend When the day we will be together again To lament the warmth of the night Destined to meet, doomed to part, but memories remain Through our short lives Yearning and unrequited love Extending over half of our lives In the abyss of time, below the bright shining moon I imagine your sorrow The world of the temporal and the boundless will of the gods Served to drive us apart Heartbreaking words, the howling of wind and rain Signal the arrival of an old friend Leaving you or leaving me Alone to grow old in this world Before we parted How were we to know how good those days actually were? Hands held tightly though finally, we parted As if the love never existed Together in ten years Inseparable after ten thousand years I regret that it will be something I will never see Together in ten years Inseparable after ten thousand years I regret that it will be something I will never see
