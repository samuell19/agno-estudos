Oh, have you met the Bumble Bee? He is on necessity for every flower that you see. Say thank you to Bumble Bee. To make a flower. Here's what you need. You've got to have a flower seed to make a seed. I guarantee you've got to have a bumble bee. Now have the flower. So now the moment was upon him. How? Men of that house of breath. And how many drinks, how many not such dream do wrong. Don't just tell him now. A little before desire. Such as? Yearning for an answer. This is wrong. Don't you know how much you come from the tumble check on Callus Creek? Yes. She was suddenly a master with tears and she was in his arms and he was writing kisses on her home, her mouth. Chapter two Sam Rose. Heart of Real. You probably know all about this stuff. This is the bumble bee. It's sweet to freeze so hungrily for a nectar from a neck. All right, Jessie, Let's see it. I'll give it back. I just want to see what you found That's so much more interesting than the family. Interpersonal relationships and human sexuality. Love. Probably. So. Let me see it. Love. Eden in flames. You got to be kidding. There's no love in books like these. Aren't any people. People in here on anything. Like real people. The dolls. The cut out dolls. I mean, if it's real love you're looking for. You are probably better off watching The Adventures of the Bionic Man or the Bionic Woman. At least they're partly flesh and blood. Now, listen, friends, I am not against sexy books, just bad, sexy books. There are good ones, you know, Lady Chatterley's Lover. Ulysses Damien. For writers like Lawrence Joyce. So maybe I'm not quite ready for them yet. For Caroline. How do you spell Chatterley? Oh, Haiti. Are you? Listen, even though you're already years beyond puppet shows like this, you're probably still not ready for the good books. Good, sexy books exist, and they're worth waiting for. Just like good, sexy love. And if you're patient, if you don't accept cheap imitations, the real thing is bound to come along. Maybe not today or tomorrow, but please, God Sooner or Later tells me if my survive to hell will arrive And the sun sun's gonna shed sooner or later to that sooner time to tell me not to worry. Don't be in a hurry Everything's gonna be great. They tell me I should slow up Take my time and grow up But sooner or later's too late Sooner or later's too late Maybe tomorrow maybe next year, and sooner or later, love will be appear Lovin's a pleasure waiting is rough. Sooner or later ain't soon enough No. Say, how old are you Two anyway? If you don't mind. Doesn't make any difference to me. I sell the stuff. I believe in it. But I guess you could tell that, couldn't you? Not bad for 50. I wish I was. It takes believing in makeup like a magic carpet. It's belief. It makes it fly. And otherwise it's just a rock. If you believe in it. Makeup has a magic all its own money. For us, it's only a dime store bought magic.. I It works well enough when it's used properly. Now, for example, how old did you say you were? 13. Oh, right now you look about 16. But remember, dear, you are not. But when you're ready to be 13 again, I don't think I'll ever be ready for that. Oh, I think you will. I know I am. Thank you. Thank you. Bye bye And tomorrow may be next year. Sooner or later, love will appear. Lovin's a pleasure waiting is rough Sooner or later ain't soon enough everybody will come to the shopping mall today. How are you feeling? We are the Sky Band.

Sounds real ambitious. Well, what about wanting to be a rock star? No, I don't think so. I got my hands full just trying to be a good musician. It's not the same as being a rock star. One thing is harder. It takes being a rock star. That's a whole different thing. You can be as big as Peter Frampton. Yeah. Paul Williams. Anyway, how would you know? You can tell, Can?

Yes, he's a he's a violinist in a symphony orchestra that doesn't make records. Oh, they're flighty musicians, Uhm ... Is she pregnant, Jess? Bob ? Sorry. She's not pregnant. No. You don't think so? I know she's not you. You ask ? of course Lillian told me when she called to invite us this afternoon. Too Salty. I'm sorry. Mom It's too salty. A girl at school is pregnant. Oh? üò≥ Yeah. I guess she must have let herself get too passionate, you üòØüòØüòØ? know? I guess. I mean, once you get passionate at all, it's probably hard to not just get more and more passionate until. Don't you think? üôÅ Well, I'm not sure that I. I don't think I would say that. I mean, if you don't let yourself get passionate at all, then you never have to worry about getting pregnant at all. So maybe that's the best thing to do. Never let yourself get passionate. I don't think so. No. Great. Mmm, good soup ... Is anyone finished? Help me Sure So, grandma too? Of course. So, Esther, what's happening on Days of Our Lives,? that doctor? Oh, what's he up to? Oh!! What are you going to do Saturday night? Oh, well, I don't know. I'll think of something, But we're going to be getting home very late. Maybe 1:00pm or later. Uh huh. Maybe you'd like to invite someone over to spend the night? Yeah, maybe ... Hmmm ... Chicken. Yeah. I told my Michael I'd have to see. And now I have. I am free Saturday night, Thats right? What? I said, that's great. Isn't it? He's 17. 17. How much about the girls? Much more than boys. A year or two.? Is Michael a mature? Are you? I am just trying to get you closer together. I know. I'm sorry. Are you scared? What? Oh, you know, messing around or wouldn't you be? Caroline? Caroline ? He's. No, no, I'm just thinking. Where are you going? To the movies. Oh, Oh ! üòÆ üòÆ So what do you think? Well ... did you tell your parents? Not exactly. You tell them. What do you think? Ohm ... I'd go out with him. That's not what I mean. I mean about messing around? Yeah. Well ... Follow your heart. Terrific. But not too far. You know That's what I do. You would play, you'd mess around, but you wouldn't mess around.? Yeah except. Hey!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I. CAVATY What !? I got a cavity! Hey, that's great. Hey, that's great. I'm going to tell my mother. Sure. I'll talk to you later, okay? Yeah, Great!! Bye Jesse you think we should buy her a book? A book? What good would that do? I don't know. I never read a book for kids, but they're supposed to be good ones. Illustrated well ... with photographs. Hmm. So it's not a book. So we talk to her. We do? I mean, between the two of us. But wouldn't that be. Wouldn't you feel awkward, or should I feel awkward about. Yeah, of course I feel awkward. Oh, I see. It's not we. It's me. Well, you're the mother. The mother doesn't think it's necessary yet. Of course it is. You just heard her. Her friends at school are pregnant, not her friend. Well, her second cousin's first girlfriend. She is not. I wonder what she would have to to wear a maternity bridal gown. All right, so maybe she's a little bit pregnant. Oh, it's not funny. Yeah, it's not Jessie, but it could be. I don't think so. Why? Because she knows how do it. Because she knows not how do it Not too well. I think it's important that she know about Right now ... You do? Yes, I do. And I think you should have a talk with her. Oh, because I'm a mother. Yes. And father knows best. It's my opinion. Your opinion? Yes, it is. Good. You have a talk with her All right. Oh, well. Good. Where we start? At the beginning. The birds and the bees? No, the bees and flowers. And where will you end? With guppies? Guppies? Yes. They're transparent. They're not. Well, not to other guppies. Otherwise there'd be no point. I just don't think it's necessary yet. I don't think that sex is a fact in Jess's life yet. I think she's informed in an adequate way. I think she's curious in a healthy way and I think she's intrigued in a normal way. And I think that's an easy way for you to get around having a talk. What will you tell her? Well, first I'm going to have to explain why it's me and not her mother who's administering the rites. You're stalling. 13 year old girls are older than they used to be. I mean, they're 16 or 17. They're 45. I don't know. They're they get exposed to more earlier, don't they, When will you tell her? When she's ready huh? You just said she wasn't ready. Yes, I did. I just hope I'm right.
