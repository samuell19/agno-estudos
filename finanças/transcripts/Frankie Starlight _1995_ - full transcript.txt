I take full credit for that, Waldo. He's my guest, aren't you, Hugo? Oh, indeed, Jamie. He used to leave whiskeyfor me in my tooth mug when we were at school. I think it was because hehad a thing for my sister. Oh, Jamie. [laughs] Hard to imagine you in the city. What exactly do you do there, Hugo? What's the best buy now? I'm not a stockbroker, Alec. I, um, I'm more of an adviserto Peter here, really. ALEC: Come on, you can give us a hint. No, I can't. Of course, it's damned hard to maintain the lifestyle of theregiment once you left it. Who pays the bills? I do. Peter does, of course. He says it's worth it forthe uh, the letter heading. He says the title looksawfully good on the stationery. [chuckles] You were never in the Army, were you, Peter? None of the services? In none of the services, no. I went straight into the city. We're, uh, we're aboutto go into South America, aren't we, Peter? We were in the Falklands. You missed something there, Hugo. HUGO: Yes. [shouting] Hello, is that Mandy? Mm-hmm. Has Lady Bruckton arrived yet? Oh, I see. Um-hum. Did she say what time she'd return? [music playing] Jamie? Are you on duty tonight? Yes, won't be long. Mind if I come along? Evening. [music playing] Here we go. Let me drive, Jamie. I ought to, really. Oh, don't be prat, Jamie. It's Hugo. Let him drive! Look after her. [music playing] [laughter and chatter] [music playing] Oh, wait a minute. Hold on, chaps. Hold on-- [vomits] [laughter] [music playing] Say, Hugo, you are comingto my stag night, aren't you? I'm best man. Oh, God help us. I don't suppose Alec's wifeis going to be much of a threat. Got her well trained already? Rather, eh? [laughs] [music playing] [glass shattering] [chuckling] JACK: And how's your wife, Hugo? Delectable Lady Bruckton, hm? I gather she's teamed up with Raul Vargas. You see, Hugo, I'd havethought you'd have been the one to handle her business affairs. Under the circumstances. Come on, Jack, leave him alone. [chuckling] [music playing] Hugo, watch out! [screams] [crash] [tires squealing] [music playing] [dog barking] OK. Is she all right? Come on, up you get. Come on. Are you OK? Get her over there. No, I don't think she should be moved. She should go over there. That's not the right thing to do. Call an ambulance. She's dead. We've got to get the police. There's nothing we can do. - Get an ambulance! - All right, quiet down! What do you mean quiet down! We can't just leave her here! Get the police! For fuck's sake, get him back in the car. I said she's dead. Jesus Christ! [shouting] Get the fucking police! Get back in the car! What are you doing! In the car! Shut up! [dog barking] For Christ's sake! Hugo, move over! [music playing] [glass shattering] Hugo, we've got to tell someone. What does she look like? She's dead! She isn't anybody. Christ. How can we just drive on? What are we doing? God! There's nothing we can do! For God's sake! We're in uniform, for Christ's sake! PETER: This hasn't happened. Do you understand? [dog barks] [keys clattering] [music playing] [phone ringing] [beep] GINNY [ON SPEAKER]: Hi, it's me. I'm still at the party. It's getting really late. Look, I'll try and get back if I can. If I don't, please don't worry. I'll probably stay at Cordelia's. Otherwise, I'll see you down at crew. Love you. [beep] [laughs] Shh! Yes, thanks. I'll get back to you. This one. Reminds me of you. Thank you so much. My memory of you, anyway. Can you hold those there? Thank you. Yeah, those are good. Can you find me a copy on those two, please? Hi, mom. Hello. Oh! Goodness, what a sight for sore eyes. [laughter] How do you like mommy's new office? Are you going to drive us down to the country? Oh, Ed, I'm sorry. I thought I told you I can't. But it's the first day at the holes. I know. I'm sorry. Your mom is very busy these days. [chatter] Hugo? Hugo? Don't worry. Why don't I drive you down? [music playing] [humming] Exeter? Why am I being roped off? We are open to the publictomorrow, my Ladyship says. Oh. They're here already? EXETER: No, it's Master Edward. Teddy? Oh. Well, this is something. This is indeed something. Teddy! Hi, grandad. GINNY: Hi. Hello, darling. Hello, darling. What have you done to your forehead? You all right? Hello, Peter. I hitched a ride with Raul. I'm going on to the Babberton's, so it's no problem. - Ah, good. Come and have a drink. You uh, you know each other, of course. Thanks, but I won't. PETER: I heard all about you. Still playing the polo? RAUL: Anyway, better go. I'll ring you over the weekend. And do your homework. Bloody Argies. Still, they do breed goodpolo ponies, don't they, Hugo? [car driving away] I'll take our luggage in. Bad for you, old boy. I don't want to! Put me down. - Yes, you do. Don't let him watch TV for too long, Benny. Oh, why on earth not? Night, night, night. Good night, sir. Good night, Edward. Sleep tight. [laughs] Hello, darling. [classical music on radio] [laughs] Whew! You never told me it was like this. [music stops] God, you've got lousy selection, Jamie. A telephone call for you. Thank you, Mr. X. Wonderful figure, that girl. Absolutely miraculous figure. I hear Virginia is becominga formidable business woman, Hugo. I do hope we won't prove too dull for her. [clunky car engine] What on earth can be making that noise? Ah, Jamie Skinner. Oh, yes, of course. Rebecca's invited him down for the weekend. PETER: Poor old Jamie. Shouldn't you get that fixed, Jamie? Hi, everybody. Hello, darling. You can use our garage if you like. Telephone tomorrow. Thanks. It sounded like an oldHook's clock coming to get you. [chuckles] Peter Pan. Hm? Old Hook's clock. And he loves his little Jaguar. Um, sorry. I was looking for Hugo. He's not here, I'm afraid. I'm just doing the uniform. Excuse me. I had such a good time last night. HUGO: Oh, really? I really wish you'd been there. I'm so pleased with that office. I really think it's going to work, you know? [music playing] I thought you said it wasall going to be over by 10:00. I telephoned. We went onto dinner afterwards. I drank far too much. Was Raul there, at dinner? [inaudible]. You left quite early. Oh. [music playing] Ginny. Do you know what it's like for me to love you? Do you have any idea? Hm? [music playing] [gong ringing] Well, here's to lots and lots of tourists and to lots and lots of money for us. Do be quiet, Rebecca. The council have this idea to buy the lower section of Down Park. HUGO: Do they, indeed? What for? A leisure center, I think. It seems to me-- I hope you don't mind? Please. Well, there may be advantages. If the council wants something from you, well, it might help infurther plans that you have. HUGO: What plans, Peter? Who's that fellow talking to my wife? GINNY: Peter. Peter. Does no one have a surname nowadays? GINNY: Peter Eggleton. Rebecca, darling, youare doing the dress show, aren't you? God. I don't want to walk up anddown modeling silly clothes. Who cares about their clothes, anyway? Who wants to be a clothes horse? I'm sure if you ask them nicely, they'll let you model the long dresses. Ginny, my legs are bloody good. It's easy to tell when youstarted on the catwalk. Got to start somewhere. No, my dear. Not all of us. There is a story that [clears throat] a young Countess of Crewne threw off all her clothes except her shoes and stockings and danced naked on the table. [chuckles] Not something that any of us would wish to see repeated now, of course. Different mansionentirely when you inherit. [chuckles] [sighs] But then I wouldn't behere to see that, would I? Worse luck. [clears throat] Couldn't we just sleep together? You'd better not be here in the morning. What is it, Jamie? What? Worrying you? [sighs] Nothing. What are you doing, Jamie? Um, nothing. Just to the loo, you know. I thought gentlemen went downstairs. Downstairs? In my family, gentlemen alwaysgo to the lavatory downstairs. Of course. I knew some Skinners in Cheshire. Um, cousins, I think. They're quite distant. Oh. Hugo tells me you werequite a scholar at school. Doesn't that mean you'resupposed to be awfully clever? No, it wasn't that sort of a scholarship. It was more a sort of a bursaryfor, um, sons of old boys if they found the fees rather right. I see. Goodnight, Jamie. Goodnight, Lady Crewne. Yeah, well, I said that. Uh-huh. [laughs] I've given up on the little man from the Coal Board compensation, but Peter says he knows the minister. [laughs] Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah. Uh-huh, OK. I'll see. I'll speak to you soon. Bye bye. So who was that, then? Cordelia inviting us to supper. Oh. [music playing] EDWARD: They won't like meso they won't want to come. GINNY: Of course they'll like you. Of course they'll like you. Do you like it when I tickle you? Yeah. Do you? I'll miss it at boarding school. I'm sure you'll find someone to tickle you. But it won't be the same as yours. No, is it a special tickle? Is it a special tickle? Yours is. I'll miss tickling you. Jamie went away toschool, didn't you, Jamie? What's that? School. Yeah. What's it like? It's fine. Tell you what. Teaches you do to make a go of things, you know? Get on with people, not make a fuss. Where's Peter? With mummy creeping. Oh, Hugo, um, Raul rang,and I invited him to lunch. JAMIE : Hugo! Hello, Jamie. It's in the papers. I've been through them all. She was alive for 17 hours. Peter said she was dead. [music playing] Jamie, I didn't mean to kill her. Look, I know you didn't intend to do it, but I really think we should come forward. Come clean. It's too late, Jamie. Too late. You can't be blamed for blacking out. No one can blame you for that,and you mustn't blame yourself. But I don't blame myself, Jamie. [music playing] Uh! What do you want? [music on radio] [whistles] Hi, darling. Are you all right? Um-hum. OK? [dogs barking] You look so in love. How long have you been there? He told me, of course,about your first meeting. Did he? Winter collection meets the chaka on ice. A perfect coupling. Look, Peter, I've got a lot ofwork to do, if you don't mind. I came to say goodbye. Oh, you're going? Yes, I've got to get back to London. Exeter is driving me to the station. So you'll have the car to yourselves. Good luck with the homework. Hugo? Hugo? Peter's leaving! [music playing] LADY CREWNE: Hugo? [music playing] Hugo? Perhaps we ought to movethe public lavatories over to the west wall. They seem to need to go such a lot. REBECCA: Well, perhaps weought to charge them for it if there's such a demand. I'm, uh, sorry about this, Raul. We, uh-- we're open to the public so we have to eat down here. LORD CREWNE: : I hearyou've been up to no good. Who says? Cook says. EDWARD: How many cigaretteshave you had today? LORD CREWNE: Don't change the subject. You know, I think he's bloody unfair. Hugo's going to inherit the lot, and all I get is some rotten littlecottage on the estate. Rebecca, darling, we'regiving you a lovely party for your birthday. Just because he's got a prick. Rebecca! REBECCA: Just because you've got a-- Shut up, Rebecca! REBECCA: Make me, huggles, darling. Go on, shut me up, like you used to. [dogs barking] [music playing] Where are the others, Edward? Where's mummy? They went over to the orangery. Were you with them? Yes, but they wanted a talk, you know. Oh. Good boy. [music playing] [moaning] [music playing] Let him look if he wants to. [music playing] [dog barking] I've, uh, got to go back tomorrow. There's a sword drill in the evening. Practice for the Queen's parade. Uh-huh. Do you think Edward looks like me, Jamie? JAMIE: Not especially. You don't think we're spoiling him, perhaps? JAMIE: No. Good. JAMIE: Short. Hugo? Yes, Jamie? About the other night. Oh, by the way, I meant to say it was very good of you to have,um, to have Peter along. Most interesting for him. Thank you so much. That's all right. Look, I don't know what it is that's making you behave like this, but-- Mind if we watch? HUGO: Of course. OK, well, I'll see you at lunch. All right? - Yes, sir. Sergeant Major! Smoking, Jack? No, thanks. It's bugger it had to be the Castlemere's cook. They'd only had her a year. Hm. Did you, uh, ever have her cheese souffle? No, can't say that I did. Well, you won't now, will you? No. We ought to make a donation or something. You'll do nothing of the sort. Anonymously. Nothing. No contact of any kind beyond us five. We agreed. Coming Thursday? Got something pretty tasty lined up. Any better now? No. I'm afraid that's the best I can do for you. All right. Bugger all. I hope you're not going to paint in the bruise. It's, um, it's changing color all the time. [skateboard clatter] Edward! Edward! How many bloody times have I told you not to do that in the house! [clock chiming] GINNY: Bye, Ed. God, I'm going to miss him. Off you come. Oh, uh, by the way, aboutthe boy's prep school. GINNY: Christ. We have to talk about it, you know. Why? I thought it had already been decided. Before he was born, beforewe even knew what sex he was. Look, he's got a place there, hasn't he? Let's just hope someone dropsa bomb on it before September. Darling, how do you expect that you're going to launch this magazineif Edward isn't going to be sent away to school? That's not fair. I don't see why I can't workand have my son with me. You know what your problem is? No, what? You want everything. Yes. [music playing] Bitch. [music playing] What the fuck was that for? What is the matter with you? Are you going to talk to me? It's my work. I don't even know what your bloody work is. Well, I'll tell you. I'd love to tell you. I don't want to know. [music playing] Ginny? You must be-- What? You must be totally bloody insensitive. Me? Why? Yes, to begin working with that-- with him. - No.- Under the circumstances. What circumstances! How do I know-- how do Iknow that you haven't been seeing him all the time? How do I know that? Look, I am not having an affair with Raul. Why do you allow yourselfto be so threatened by him? I chose you. Peter-- Peter could have helped. [music playing] Peter. Look, I never meant to hurt you by this. You always said that I gave you everything. You do. You do love me, don't you? You do? Show me. [music playing] [moaning] [music playing] What's happening to you? What's happening to you? Jamie? Jamie Skinner? Ah, I thought it was you. I didn't know you lived here. I'm just up the way. You must come for a drink sometime. [music playing] - Morning, Ken. - Good morning, Lord. How are you? Very well, thank you. Gerrold. Hello, sir. Ah. Hello, Cord. This young man, Luke, needs a haircut. He's off to his new schoolin a few weeks, so-- Jolly good. -- don't spare the clippers. Right. So how do you do to Mr.Luke, Edward. How do you do, Mr. Luck? How do you do, sir? LUKE: Would you like somethingon his hair, my Lord? Yes, why not? Nothing to sticky, though. LUKE: Very good, sir. [shouting] [burlesque music] It was right outside Raul Vargas's house. Oh, really? Did you think it was Ginny? Did you think it was Ginny? Did you? Did you! Piss off. [shouting] [music playing] Edward? Edward? What you got there? Look. [dog barking] She's caught a mole. [laughs] What is it? Oh, it's a mole. Somebody's caught a mole. Hello. [laughs] It's a lovely dog. Lovely dog, aren't you? [speaking japanese] PETER: What we're looking at here is a 20% yield minimum for that. Guaranteed. Most of the heavy plant here will be Herman, and we're considering the possibility of using cane sugar by products. Um-hum. And there's a ready-made road. - What, all the way from there?- Yeah. I don't believe this. Glad you made it out, eh? So, so, here's-- here's go you, Joe. Joe, um, DiMaggio. Dimandino. Uh, DiMaggio played ball. Oh, really? So will you, Joe. So will you. [water stops] You stupid bastard, Hugo. Why do I always have to cover up for you? Listen to me. From now on, you do exactly what I say. Has that sunk in here? Hey? [laughter] Oh! Ah, yes! Ah! I'm very sick. [laughter] Rebecca? You know that accident? Hm? On Chesham Street? Everybody's calling it the wheels on meals. - Christ.- What is wrong with you? Look-- It wasn't an accident. It was in this car. I think Hugo was trying to hit Ginny. You're mad. He was driving. You're crazy. I was in the car. You've got the wrong person. [chatter] No, I don't see any problem at all. But, um, I'll get back to you on it, all right? Is he in? Hugo, yes. Thank you. Hi, darling. I've been thinking about you. Right, bye. I wanted to talk to you. Are you OK? Can I take you to lunch? Have you got time? I always have time for you, my darling. Do you? I love you. [door opens] Just taking Hugo to lunch. I'm sorry. That's, um, impossible. Hugo and I have got to goover tonight's strategy. HUGO: Peter, I thought you said we were going to do that this evening? I know, but I've had to reschedule. I really am sorry. Uh, game for you. Apparently, it's urgent. [door closes] You ought to tell him to piss off. Why don't you-- What? [bell clanging] [applause] Hello, John. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Madge Castlemay! This horrid business. You know, this rumor about Hugo. God knows how it got started. Of course, it's quite ludicrous. Of course it is. Jamie, I wasn't even there that night. I know, but couldn't he have thought it was you? Jesus Christ, what are you saying? This is nonsense. [music playing] [doorbell ringing] OFFICER: Good evening, sir. [voices talking] [music playing] The accident happened lateat night a few weeks ago. [voices] But the woman was taken to hospital. [voices] The incident took placeoutside the home of Mr. Vargas. I believe you know him, sir. Former business associate of yours. HUGO: Yes, I know Mr. Vargas very well, but, uh, I fail to see whatthat has to do with me. OFFICER: Quite. You've heard the rumor linkingyour name with the event? HUGO: Yes, it's ridiculous. OFFICER: Yes, sir. But where were you that night? HUGO: Well, as a matter of fact, I was having dinner with some offriends from my old regiment. Hello,darling. Gentlemen. Lady Bruckton. Forgive the appalling venue and the wine list. The Turf And White's would haveseemed a little conspicuous, so I chose Soho. Oh, come on, Peter. It's obvious why we're here. Someone's let the cat out of the bag, and it has to be one of us, doesn't it? Someone here has talked. And we all swore not to. Has anyone here saidanything to anyone about this? - Yes. - What! Yes. - You? - I said yes. Oh, Jamie! I'm sorry, Hugo. I really am. Well, go on! What do you mean, go on? Who did you tell? You broke your word. I suppose you've told everybody! No. Who? I want tell you. You bloody well will. No. God, you little hypocrite! Talk about double standards. Little shit. Have you been sendingme blackmail notes, Jamie? No. Not very clever of you, was it? Considering you look like the guilty party. JAMIE: What do you mean? What do you mean? [dance music] No! No! Bitch. Oh, you bitch. You bloody bitch! I'm sorry, Hugo! I'm sorry! I didn't mean to do it! Bitch. It was a joke. It was just a joke. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. I'm so sorry. [music playing] Do you know where moles have their ears? LORD CREWNE: No. Under their armpits. [laughs] It's true. John told me. I don't know how John knows, though. [coughing] Anyway, how many have you had today, grandpa? What? Cigarettes. Oh. Five. Let me see the packet. How many were in the packet? 20. Oh, by the way, how is the, uh, the new girl? Jenny? She's fine. Edward seems to like her. Good. Good. You going out tonight? No. Why do you ask? We-- we could have dinner out if you like? No, I-- I just thought thatif you wanted to go out, I was going to have an early night. Oh. I see. Well, in that case, I thinkI'll stay at the club. GINNY: "'I can't stand it. I just can't stand it,' saidthe little boy as he was taken to see the lions in their cage. 'I bet they'd be more happy at home." Every time he went to the zoo, he did his best to talk them out of it, but they only laughed at him." Right, sleepytime. [music playing] [door clicks] GINNY: Toby? Toby, where are you? [humming] Toby? Basket. Go on, bed. [phone ringing] Hello? Hello, darling. No, he's out. Listen, Cordelia, I'm downstairs. Let me pick up in the bedroom, OK? [hangs up phone] [footsteps] Captain J. Skinner. Yes, he was duty officer that evening. Now can you tell me what this is all about? Would his car be kept here, sir? His car? Captain Skinner is afirst rate career soldier. Actually, he's a fine officer. I'm sure that in this case there's a perfectly straightforward explanation. Well, I can't believe he's your man. The car? Shall we look at the car, sir? [music playing] [mumbling] It clearly wasn't Hugo who was responsible. I spoke to Peter about it,and he tells me the rumor was started by Jamie Skinner. Well, I never did have any confidence in him. There's nothing worse than being disloyal to-- Peter told you that that? That is ridiculous. But that's not the point! The point is we must alldo our very best for Hugo so that no one can be in the slightest doubt. Edward loves coming here, doesn't he? Edward? Yes. It's so good for him to get out of London. Yes, it is. You gave everyone suchpleasure when he was born. Oh, good. Of course, I was alwaysa great support of yours. It's so important whenthere are children involved. It would be quite terrible-- unthinkable-- for Edward if anything should happen to Hugo. Yes, so nice to chat with you like this. I'd been meaning to, you know, for some time. I want you to feel that you really are a part of this family. [buzzing] REBECCA [ON SPEAKER]: Yeah? It's me. REBECCA [ON SPEAKER]: Jamie,for God's sake, it's only 7:00. I've got to come in. Rebecca? Please, I need to come in. I've got to have somewhere to stay. The police are after me. REBECCA [ON SPEAKER]: Oh,that's your own fault. You shouldn't have gone tothem in the first place. I didn't! [music playing] [band music playing] Good evening, sir. Mr. And Mrs. Horsley Stevens. Good evening, Sir Brian. Sir Brian and Lady Castlemere. Colonol and Mrs. Smythe Jones. Hello. Don't I get a birthday kiss? Mr. Richard Lindley and Lady Elizabeth f Happy Birthday. Are you coming to the disco later? It's in the stables. We've called it the eighth house. You know, sex and death. Don't worry, I'll show you. EXETER: Brigadeer and Mrs.Ethelridge. Mr. David Steven and the Honorable Miss Natasha Grenforth. Captain and Mrs.-- What an evening. It's absolutely enchanting. Oh, thank you. Good evening, sir. I'm shaking too many damn hands. Above all, knickers. Hugo! Hello, Alec. Ginny, darling. Hello, Alec. Dance? Oh, come on. Save a dance for me, Ed. [inaudible] Got you! Excuse me. Excuse me. You're excused. Excuse me. [inaudible] [inaudible] [music playing] [band music] Good evening, Hugo. Good evening, Lady Castlemere. Brian, how are you? You're looking well. - You, too. Thank you. May I have my wife back, please. Of course. Thank you. I think we should go for a walk, my darling. [WHISPERING] It's very inconvenient. Two ghastly policemen. I thought they'd come about the parking, but they want to interview Hugo. They're most insistent. I'll see to it. Rebecca? Rebecca. Ah. An afterthought if ever there was one. I can't think what you must have been thinking of when you thought of her. I must have been out of mymind when I thought of her. Must have lost my mind. Look, Hugo, it's a bit cold for this. I think we should go back. I'm so sorry, my darling. Thanks. I want us to be alone tonight. You look so beautiful tonight. I've never seen you look so beautiful. Do you remember when I first brought you here, when you first saw this? Captain? What have you done? Please, Hugo, don't do this. You're frightening me, Hugo. No one will disturb us here. Ginny, I love you so much. GINNY: What are you-- Listen to me! Listen to me. I forgive you, Ginny, just as you forgive me. GINNY: Don't do this. I'm scared. Ginny, don't be afraid. Come here, my darling. GINNY: [gasps] [music playing] [music playing] [gasps] [band music playing] Shit, Jamie's here. Jamie, what the hell are you doing here? Where's Hugo? You look dreadful. I want to see Hugo. You can't at the moment. Come on. [sobs] Ah, Sergeant. I'm so sorry to have kept you waiting. Rather hectic evening, I'm afraid. Sorry to drag you away, sir. That's quite all right. Are they looking after you, Waller? About the accident. Oh, yeah? We need to talk to Captain Skinner before we proceed further. Of course. Anything that I can do to help. I-- DETECTIVE: Have you heard from him? Any idea of his whereabouts? No. DETECTIVE: But presumably younow a number of his friends. Will you excuse me forjust a few moments, Sergeant? DETECTIVE: This shouldn't take long. Well, there are someguests who've just arrived, and I must attend to them. You know how it is. Thank you, Sergeant. Jamie, that the hell have you been up to? Hm? Oh, look. We've got a gate crasher. [inaudible] Jack. Let's keep this to ourselves. We've got a gate crasher, everybody! Jack! Skinner's trying to worm his way in. I understand from our hostess you weren't invited to this party. For God's sake. You're improperly dressed. And you're drunk. Look at him. Stay there! [laughter] Get up, Skinner. Up you get, Skintworm. Up you get, worm. I want to talk to Hugo. Well, he doesn't want to talk to you. None of us do. I just want to talk to him, really. Stand up, Skinner. Your mother wants you, Hugo. What? PETER: She's certainthey're going to arrest you. Stand up, Skinner. Stand up, damn you. We know what to do withthe gate crasher, don't we? We chuck him in the pond! [yelling] [yelling] [TOGETHER] One! Two! [music playing] OK, Skinner. Party's over. Time to go home, now, eh? Come on, upsey daisy. On your feet, Skintworm. Get up. Don't look too clever, do you old man? No. Time to get him home, I think. Yeah, come on. Who's a brave boy now? Come on, up. Upsey daisy, come on. Get up. There we are. Soon have you back tucked up, my love. Yeah. Time for the party poopers to go home, eh? [music playing] Oh, there you are. I've been looking for you all over the place. Hi, Ed. You've been crying. Yes. [music playing]
