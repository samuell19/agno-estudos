Blanca? Blanca? Blanca!? There’s no way of knowing, madam. Blanca may stay this way for a day, a month or years. It’s important that you stay with her. That you talk to her. That you play some music to her. Many patients that were in a coma when they wake up, they remember things their families told them. What happened to my daughter, doctor? We don’t know, madam. We are running some studies to try and understand the situation. Plus, she’s lactating. There’s a chance of pregnancy. Are you sure? We’ll know for sure once the results are in. But there’s a possibility. Hi, darling. How are you feeling? I don’t know how I feel. Strange. I don’t understand anything. Sure, of course. You didn’t need to come. It’s good for me to come. It distracts me. Yes, you are right. We were thinking about trying hair and make-up. You in? -Yes, great. -Shall we do it now? Perfect. Let’s go, Lucho. Make yourself comfortable. Is that all right? Clara! Girl, you’ll leave no hair on him. I’m sorry, Lucho. I don’t know where my head is at. I’m sorry. Take a look, I made this beard for you to see. It still needs the mustaches and eyebrows and finishing up the hair. That’s perfect. Put some hair gel on it. And the mustache just a little bit thinner than the drawing, ok? -The eyebrows this way? -Yes. But hurry, we don’t have much time, ok? -Love you. -Me too. Did I tell you I’m going to look after you? I’m so happy. My name is Amaia and we are going to work hard to wake you up. If you need anything, I will always be near. Blanca... What do you make of this? How can we explain it has no pulse, no heart activity, it’s not breathing but it still maintains a minimum brain activity? It’s not working on animals the way we expected. We have to try it on someone. We have to figure out the tachycardia, the possible cardiac arrests. It would be ideal if we could produce a synthetic oxytocin that’s as efficient as ours. Want to eat together? -No, I already made plans with Clara. -Ok. Honey, I won’t make it. You should have told me sooner. I miss you. Blanca? Blanca? Blanca? Blanca? Hello. I’m calling to get some information. My name is Blanca Linares. Yes... The number is 800006034. Yes, I had an test done some days ago and I need to know if I’m pregnant or not. Because I don’t understand them. In one week? Blanca! How are you? -Fine. And you? -Fine. Rama, can I get two beers? You know? I didn’t think you’d come. I thought you were just fucking with me on the chat. -Here you go. -Thanks. Honey, I take my chats very seriously. Cheers to that. Shall we go to my place? I can’t today. I have to close up in here. Stop! Hey, stop. Don’t go. I want to show you something. Close your eyes, don’t peek. Slowly, careful. You'll fall. Where are we? We are in my room. Are those the guys that rent with you? Yes, those are the ones that didn’t pay. They are ghosts now. Like yourself, you are kind of a ghost. Sure, that’s true. I’m almost transparent. You are also kind of like a rabbit, with those red eyes. Sure, they are very light blue. With red pupils. And my brain is white. CLARA: Send me a picture of you, I won’t recognize you. BLANCA: You cannot not recognize an albino. Better send your photo. BLANCA: Pretty. How old are you? CLARA: Thirty. BLANCA: You seem younger. See you tonight. I’ll come by your bar. CLARA: I’ll be waiting. ROGER: Good morning! I wanted to send some love. ROGER: I had a great time last night. BLANCA: Yeah, me too. Kisses from the lab. ROGER: Just so you don’t forget me... ANDREA: Don’t forget we changed the class to Thursday. BLANCA: Yes, sure. Thanks! Excuse me... -Yes? -Are you Blanca Linares’ doctor? Yes. How may I help you? I wanted to have some news about Blanca, about her condition. And who are you? I’m her friend. Her very close friend. And I’m worried. Okay... She is in a vegetative state. She’s not aware of herself or her surroundings. But how? For how long? I don’t know how long. It’s indefinite. You need to be patient. Now, if you excuse me, I have to see other patients. I need to know if she’s pregnant. Calm down. I can only give that information to her relatives. And I don’t know who you are. Now, if you excuse me, I have people to see. Look at all the stripes I have in my hand. It’s this one. I’m getting more and more. I don’t see anything. You liar, how can you not see them? I see you, my love. Come on, explain it to me. How come you don’t see? Look... At this distance I see... I think your nails are black or maybe brown, but if we move a bit closer. I really can’t tell yet. But now, yes, I can see they’re black. It’s the first time anything like this happens to me. I don’t know, I feel... I feel complete. I don’t need to be with anybody else. Happy. Does this happen to you? Did it ever happen to you? I don’t know, I don’t think so. Blanca... Hi, honey, how are you? Sure, I do want to sleep with you but I wanted to let you know it won’t be possible. I’m all tied up. Talk to you later. Kisses. -Hello, how are you? -Fine. And you? -Fine. See you today? -Yes, at 9 pm? Perfect. Your friend’s got a nice house. Maillard or Glycosylation, that’s the name of the reaction between proteins and carbohydrates that releases brown pigments. That’s what makes food change its color. Do you always think of stuff like that when you are cooking? Everything I do, I think about it. My heart rate went up from 60 to 130 bpm. I released a lot of oxytocin, that makes me hot. Everything all right? Yes, it’s just the alarm clock, it goes off at the same time every day. We should think about combining it with other compounds. Look at this paper. With this one we might be able to have more natural effects. Less pain and contractions. More pleasure. Get it? That’s good. I want to test it on me. I would like for you to do the follow-up and take notes. Stop that. We already talked about that. Fine, don’t worry. I was just saying. Hello. Good afternoon, my name is Blanca Linares. Yes, how are you? I called about a week ago, I asked about a blood test I did. A pregnancy test, yes. A beta. Sure, I hold. Finally, the Sun came out. I love the autumn light, it’s so orange. The floor is all covered up with leaves. We are almost done. Please wait outside. There you go. Who are you looking for? Blanca. I haven't seen her for a while. There, you can come in now. You look so beautiful. I will comb you. I like that, for you to look at me when I talk to you. It was always great when the two of us talked. Let’s see what they’re feeding you. It was obvious you weren’t pregnant. Look how skinny you are. There’s a message for the misses. Want me to read it? Fine. Lucas says: ‘I’m waiting for you. Are you coming?’ Look at that, she woke up. This Lucas must be important. You want me to prepare you? Shall I dress you? Better not, just rest a bit. Where are you? At the corner near your work. I’m at the corner. You? Is there anybody there? Is there anybody there? I can’t get in. If you can tell it’s make-up, it won’t work. You taste so good, darling. And you? Very good. Norwegian company. Filled with Norwegian girls. I love it that they chose you because you are so smart. The conference was easier than I expected. I did ok with my English, they told me they could understand. What I like about here is I don’t seem like a freak. They are all blond and white like me. The closing party was great. We danced a lot. I got so wasted I don’t remember a thing. Airport, September 13th. I miss Andrea. She relaxes me. She grounds me. I have a good time. That whole world transports me. She explains it to me. Here in Butho I am also a ghost. You are pulled by the string that comes from your sternum. You slide... And suddenly our hearts want to touch each other. Don’t let the energy cut off at the wrist. It flows to the tip of your fingers. That's it. You search with your head. That’s it. Move every area I touch. That’s it. We lower the center. Bend the knees. You are pulled by the string that comes from your sternum. Follow your partner. Let’s stop. Your heart is pulling out. One side and the other. That's it. And hang. Great, thank you. Beautiful. Remember this last part. And also the positions. See you next week. So? Did you like it? -I loved it. I want to start right away. -Right away? Okay, let’s see. Come. -I take these off, right? -Yes. Come here. It's like a bee sting. Move towards it. Come. Where you feel it. That's it. Breathe it. I'm not breathing. Follow it with your breathing. Now you can do it to me. Come. I get dizzy. Okay, then... And yet it had entered me without me knowing it. It had probed my memory and discovered my most sensitive spot. Without help, without a wave, it went through the hermetic shield of the station and found me and took me for its loot. The first time I applied oxytocin nothing really happened. I felt completely normal. Somewhat renewed. It’s function is linked to contact and orgasm. THE FUNCTIONS OF THE ORGASMS How come you didn’t warn me? I asked you, I told you to do the follow-up. I didn’t think you meant it. Now I have to do the follow-up, you leave me no choice. Honey, I’ll wait for you at 8 at our bar. Be ready, this will be a long night. Kisses. Now I get it. You’re in this state because you don’t want to talk to me. You’re feeling guilty, right? You chose this. You chose to be this way. You are doing this on purpose. Talk to me. Talk to me! Hello. I’m Blanca. Blanca? You seem different. Sorry, my mistake. No, wait. Stay. -Want to have something? -Yes. Daddy, a beer. -Everything all right? -Fine. You? Thanks. Do you come here often? I’m always here. Some friends work here. Plus I love this old hotel vibe. Yes, it’s cool. What do you do for a living? I’m a make-up artist. -Can I ask you a question? -Sure. Do you know Blanca? Yes, I know her. She’s my girlfriend. I didn’t know she was seeing someone. Don’t worry, I didn’t either. I saw you on the chat and came. I like that. Great. Where are you from? -Paraguay. -From Paraguay? Come on, say something in Guarani. What does that mean? That you are very pretty. Is this how she used to kiss you? Not really. Blanca? Blanca. Silver blinding light In your silken hair Close your eyes And sleep on my chest The morning angels Are waiting for you to wake To kiss your tiny hands And give love to your life Silver hair Tiny honey hands Silver hair Tiny honey hands Good morning. Hello, my love. How are you? It’s great that it stopped raining. Such a lovely view from here. From my room you can’t see anything. Yes, I’m happy. I started Butho. You are doing so much better. I’m sure we will be leaving this place soon, you know? Give me your hand. I’m sorry, Miss, the patient is too delicate. I know what she needs. Yes but I’m the one who’s in charge here. Did you fall in love with her as well? I think you are confusing me with someone else. Are you authorized to be here? Are you a relative? Yes, sort of. What does it matter to you what my relationship with her is? I think you’d better go now. Who’s going to make me? You? Not exactly, but I will go down to Reception and find out if you are authorized to be here with her. I’m going to get you all nice and pretty. What color do you prefer? Black or red? I also think red. Honey, your nails are all dried up. Mine are fine. Keep going. I feel we are doing great for the final show. That's it. Precision in stillness. And now we are going to make room for the sprouts. Precision as well. In the hands. In the mouth. That’s it, let others appear. Take your place and let’s continue. Now we move over from the cacti to the nailed butterfly. Great, that’s it. You hold yourself from the string upwards. Yes, that’s good. Think if you'd like to join the show. I ended up all loose. I had a hard time walking. I want to try these knots with you! Chose the one that makes you the horniest. I love the second photo. So strong! Hello, Lucas. You there? Yes. It’s late! What are you doing up? I just got in. And you? What were you doing? I’m in the countryside. At my house. I was in Stockholm. It’s beautiful. When are you coming? Look at me. Look at what she did to you. I’ll get the doctor. Wait here, please. How are you doing? All right? Are you girls ready? Are you ready? We did some great work up to here. We are now solid. All that’s left is to enjoy. I love you all. Hello. Where are you? I got lost. Come look for me or I’m leaving. You know where to get off. What happened to you? I got lost. Can you get down and open the gate? I broke my shoe. I’ll get some of yours. They’re in your bedroom. I’ve been keeping that for you for a very long time. I thought I’d lost it. These always fitted you very well. No, don’t take it off. Leave it. Can you bring me my cup, please? I’m not feeling well. I want to go home. Already? You just got here. We haven’t even started playing. You want to start? Yes. Are you ready? Aren’t you going to say anything? What’s so funny? What if I drop you? Please let me down. I can't go on. I’ll let you go if you tell me who you are. All right, then. EXQUISITE CORPSE EXQUISITE CORPSE
