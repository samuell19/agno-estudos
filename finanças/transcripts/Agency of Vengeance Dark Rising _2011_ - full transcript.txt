Sure, rook. What are you doing? Reminiscing. Who'’s the cutie? Renee Phillips. We used to be friends. She was experimenting with witchcraft, and she opened the portal that brought Summer here. She died. Another friend? Ricky Rodriguez. He turned into a demon, so Summer killed him. He died. The fact that I'’m your friend, gotta say; not looking too promising. You know why people choose to live in the past? Because it'’s comfortable. There'’s no twists. There'’s no surprises. Just predictable, horribly wonderful regret. Sir, if this is about Summer and you feeling guilty for what happened at her wedding... Rule number one, Evans: It'’s always about Summer. Right. So she'’s in a dark place right now. She'’ll be fine in a couple months. Her fiancée was eaten by a giant worm, Evans. I'’m not sure how quickly you bounce back from that. I'’m just saying something doesn'’t feel right about what happened to Summer. Really? Which part? I'’m being serious, jackass. A sand slug is a sand slug. It'’s not really known for having a well-developed brain or anything. Your point? My point is... is the sand slug attacked Summer'’s wedding. Why attack Summer'’s wedding? Why not attack somewhere else or someone else? It was specifically targeting her. I'’m just worried, Evans. I think Summer'’s in danger, that'’s all. Meow... People, settle down! Listen up! There'’s been an abnormal amount of activity across The Divide. Erratic temporal energy fluctuations and an increase in demonic portal crossings. Now this all details a huge shift in dark magic. Investigative operations has been monitoring this traffic, and let me tell you, ladies and gentlemen, something is brewing. Now in addition, operations has also uncovered the theft of various electromagnetic equipment from different government facilities. The sort of equipment used to transfer large amounts of energy. Good tech or bad tech? We'’re talking about something that can wipe out half the northeastern seaboard. That'’s bad tech, right? We believe this is all connected to something larger: Mardock. Holly? Mardock, an evil god-like creature worshipped in the pre-Babylonian era. Destroyed by a group of high priests and trapped in the astral plane. Mardock is said to be forever looking for a new body that can act as a vessel for his limitless power. How do you know all this? Thank you, Holly. Mardock is attempting to become corporeal again, that he is searching for a new body. Now, people, we cannot let this happen. We need-- Summer. Oh. Don'’t let me interrupt. Carry on. I know what you'’re thinking, but I am fine. Strong as ever. Strong like-- Like a bull. Any leads, sir? - Yes. One. - Activate. Intel informs us that this is the man we'’re looking for. These are satellite surveillance photographs from a couple of weeks ago, when three of our agents encountered this man, who we'’re choosing to call Mr. X. That'’s original. He'’s good. No, he'’s very good. Now, people, I want to know who this Mr. X is, and I want to know now. And will somebody please clean up Summer? Present! Whew! You are stinky. Parks, I want a word with you. Have a seat. I wanna talk to you about something that I didn'’t mention in the meeting because I want you to understand the gravity of the situation. The agents that were attacked by Mr. X, they were transporting a key artifact to one of our research facilities. It never arrived. What never arrived, sir? The Book of Shadows. Our book. The one that brought Summer back? The one that-- and I'’m quoting you here-- has such incredible powers, if it ever fell into the wrong hands-- One and the same. Now, if this book is in Mr. X'’s possession, and he'’s interested in reincarnating Mardock, and he knows which phrases to recite, we'’ve got a bit of a problem. Now, I want you to do what you do.
