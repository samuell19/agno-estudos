I'll take caller number seven right now. Oh, man, this is caller seven! - Huh? - I'm caller seven, right? You're caller number seven. Who is this? This is Butcher Duke! Do I get to play for the home or what? I mean, Kathy and I have been dreaming about this ever since we first saw 'em drive by on the highway, you know? Now, if you beat Creek Thompson two out of three games, you win a manufactured home. You bet I do! It's so funny 'cause people say these are tornado magnets, you know, these manufactured houses, and I say, "No, they're not. They're not tornado magnets." It's not like tornado's like, "Ooh, ooh, manufactured house." You know, what I tell people is, "Look, if God wants ya, he's gonna take ya." I think this is God's way of showing me. You know, "This is it, Butch. You can do it." I tell ya, I mean, of course, I'm human, I have some doubts. Butcher had a chance to win at state and he lost the first round. I'm content where I am, I'm happy, but I know if I can win this home, man, it'll make things better. Game end match, Mr. Thompson. Not only did Butcher lose a double-wide mobile home that day, he also lost a big piece of his warrior heart. Some say he's never been the same since. All right, guys, so why are we here? - To have fun! - Why is that? Because we're not very good. Not very good. We had a tough year last year, didn't we, Knox? - Yeah. - We didn't win a match. But guess what. That was okay with me. I had a great time with you guys. I feel closer to you. I mean, really, I'd call you my best friends if that wasn't a little weird. I've got goals for the team, but I need to know what your goals are. Okay, Faith, what do we got? I really want to learn a between-a-leg shot. That's my favorite shot, we're gonna work on that. Kaylee, what do we got? I want to be able to serve straight. Yeah, I don't think you got a serve in last year. Knox, what do you got, what's your goal this year? To not cry. - How about you, Jack? - I want a girlfriend. Me too. So, we got a match on Friday, and I decided to go to the east side to pick up some new blood. Make him feel welcome. John. Tell us a little bit about yourself, bud. I want to get better at self-expression, lyrical poetry, and dance, mainly. Well, piggy-backing off of John, I'm in anger management. And you all know I needed it. You know, I used to throw my racket. Sorry about that, Knox. I still can't drive or vote or go roller skating. But guess what, I can coach tennis. And this year, we're gonna win a match, and I think it starts Friday at Ramsey, right? - Yeah! - Okay, who's gonna have a forehand this year? - That's right. Forehand. - Forehand. - Backhand. - Backhand. - Volley. - Volley. - Lob. - Lob. And between-the-legs overhead spin shot. Start again! I hope you're enjoying the Saturday afternoon movie, Over the Top, with Sly Stallone, but I'll be quick. We have two bedrooms, three bedrooms, four bedrooms, five bedrooms, all the way up to two or three bedrooms. But, listen, believe me today. Come on down after the movie. I want to serve you quality today! - That was your dad. - And he looked good. We looked at the numbers, okay, and a big reason for your dad's success was his commercial campaigns, so we were thinking... - Hire an actor. - Why not do it with you? It's not easy being the son of an ex-tennis pro mobile home mogul, but with his daddy evading taxes in South Vietnam, Delta's doing the best he can. - Oh. - You are the one who's sitting in the executive chair, okay? And you could really change this. I'm flattered, ladies, I really am, but, you know, I just... You're young and exciting. And think about it, with tiny homes, our audience is young people anyway. So what type of commercial are we thinking? Oh, a good one. I like that. - Hey, Don? - Yeah, boss. Could you get us a camera? We're shooting a commercial. That sounds like a good idea. Yeah, all right, I got to go. I'll teach you later. Bye, guys! See you tomorrow. See you, Butch. - What's up, Gordy? - Hey, Butch. Uh, where are we going? - I need a protein shake. - Protein shake. Yeah, yeah, get in, let's go. The tag, and here comes the man formerly known as Will Lockhart, now under the spell... Oh, I'm hungry, Mom. Well, there's things in the fridge. Help yourself. What? Oh my gosh, Emily is getting married? Who's Ellis? Dadgummit, why didn't you tell me this? I thought you and Emily were gonna talk. You know we haven't talked in forever, Mom. Gosh, look at this guy. He kind of looks like me. Oh, hey, did you finish your side of the guest list for... so we can start sending out invitations? Uh, yeah, I've got, like, an idea in my head. Um, I know I want to invite my Uncle Greg and that side of the family like my cousins. Yeah, are they... they're driving in? - Yeah, driving in. - Oh, that's great. I'm so glad they can make it. I know. And, then, obviously my paintball team. Um, how many is that? Um... I think it's 20, about. - Twenty? Twenty people? - Can we maybe just invite, like, half of the paintball team? I guess we could invite just, like, the Raptors, - but I mean... - Okay, who's on the Raptors? Tyler, Matt, Ben, Reggie, the one with the glass eye. There's Jim, there's Chris, there's Danny. And that's just the defense. So the offense is Tim, Brad, Matt, Carter. If I invite Carter, I have to invite Marcus 'cause he's, you know. Felony Marcus? - What? - Felony Marcus? Don't bring up the felony again. It's always the felony with Marcus, the felony this, the felony that. They're my paintball team, babe! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to raise my voice. I'm just so stressed out. Babe, you don't need to be stressed. - Why are you stressing? - I can't help it. There's a lot of expenditures happening right now, and I'm kind of balling on a budget, and my couponing can only go so far. And I don't mean to be mean, but your family is not really able to help out, and... Gosh, is your dad even gonna be there? Looks like Ellis is about to open a can of daddy issues. Can we just... can we just focus on the logistical stuff right now? Okay. - So, catering... - Got it covered. Mom's got the gumbo and all the broth premade, so we just got to heat it up on the day of the wedding. Sorry, the broth? Yeah, I thought we talked about this. The broth from Thanksgiving? I was kind of thinking we could do something a little nicer for the dinner. Nicer than chicken broth, babe? Oh, my arm is hurting. I'm having a heart attack. I don't know, guys. I can't do this. Let's just hire an actor. Delta, look at me, look at Jennifer. Look at me. Say, "I'm Delta Thompson." - I'm Delta Thompson. - Say it again. - I'm Delta Thompson? - With force. - I'm Delta Thompson. - One more time! I'm Delta Thompson! Are you having a good day? I know I am! Are you tired of living in the dump you're living in? Well, not to fear because we've got the solution for you! That's right! And by the way, we have 0% APR financing, and I know what that means! We've got homes with one bathroom... - Two bedrooms! - Two bedrooms! Oh, no! It looks like it broke! But guess what. We want to give you homes today. That's gonna be a thousand dollars. - You said $15 an hour. - Mm, thousand dollars. I'm gonna need that right now. Ladies, you know I'm not good with numbers. It's an extra 15 for the two wings you broke too. You broke that. I'm not God, I didn't create the wind. All right, let's see your grunts. Everybody's got to have a grunt. Serena, John McEnroe, Connors, Borg, Dominique Ravicii. Okay, Djokovic, Murray. - Should I name more? - No. Okay, all right, here we go. Oh, that was awesome! Let's go. Here we go, John. Whoa, let's go, here we go, Jack. Okay, doesn't mean you have to hit the ball hard 'cause you didn't even touch the ball. So, Kaylee, don't tell the rest of the kids this, but you're probably my favorite student. - Thanks. - Yeah. I said probably, not yet. I haven't made up my mind, but... - Okay. - It's between you and Knox, Faith, and Jack, so... - Okay. - Oh, look who's here. That's your dad. - Hey, Brad. - How are you doing, Butch? You got it. Bye. Man, I don't know, Gordy. I've... I've thought about calling her, I've thought about, you know, going to her work, try to catch her coming out. I don't know where she lives now, but maybe I could figure that out. It's hard, man. Whose house is this? You know whose it is. We're at your estranged daughter's house. All right, here it goes. Emily? - Did you hear that? - Emily? Hello? There you are. - Dad. - Gosh. Hey. Butcher Duke. Sir, Ellis Perkins. It is so nice to meet you. Hey, Emily. - You look good. - Thanks. You too. Uh, what are you... what are you doing here? Well, I heard my daughter was getting married. I thought I'd come by and say congratulations. - That's exciting. - Yeah. Thank you, it means a lot. Things are... things are going well? You still working at the hospital? Yeah, yeah, I guess I've been working there for about a year, so... - It's going well? - Yeah, I love it. It's great. You still playing tennis? Uh, no. I didn't know you played tennis. - She's good. - Played in like middle school. State runner-up. Em, I just... I just want to say, um, I know I wasn't the best father, but I'm different, and I just want to let you know that I care about you. I just wanted to tell you that and, I don't know, you're getting married and I'd just, uh, I'd just like to be a part of it if I could. - Okay. - Is anybody walking you down the aisle? Uh, yeah, so I think I'm probably just gonna walk myself down the aisle. Just keep it simple. Okay. Okay, well, um... Well, gosh, it's good to meet you, Ellis. The pleasure is mine, sir. Truly. And, Emily, I'll see you around, okay? All right, bye, guys. Bye. Look, all I'm saying is, I think it's pretty cool that your dad came by. I think so too. I think it was really a big step for him, but I am not there yet, so... Okay. I mean, what did he do that was so terrible? Um, I'll show you. Golly! Emily! - Dad! - What? Stop, please! Your daughter is cheating. Emily! Stop! - Oh, wow. - Yeah. Dad, you're embarrassing me. Get a ride home! Stop, you're embarrassing me. What did you say? Wow he... he knows how to throw a punch. Mm. Your kid's a cheater, man! - Dad! - What? Stop, please! Get a ride home. Get a ride home! Hey, that's my daughter. Agh! - Emily! - Dad, stop. What'd you say, mofo? Golly! Emily! Come on, dear. We've been shooting like 60% for free throws. It's ridiculous. Thirty or forty feet from the basket. No way. Watch this, if they score here, I swear I'm gonna throw this remote. - Momma, I'll throw it. - Do not throw my remote. I'll buy you a new one. I don't even smoke, but I want to start. Well, to cheer you up, look what I found in the attic last night. Oh my goodness. Look at that. - Little Butcher. - Little me. - Aww. - Yeah, and... - Tennis rackets. - Yeah. - What? - And I need you to move out. - What? - I need you to move out. Why? You've been here ten years. Yeah? And because Jan is wanting a place to stay. I can share a room with Jan, Mom. Jan would not go for that. You don't know that. Well, how long are you gonna give me? Nine days. Nine days? - Nine days? - Nine days. Sometimes life is hard, buddy. Even your mom will punch you in the gut every once in a while. Jump over him, nice. Oh, that'll do it. - Hey! - Hey, ladies. How's it going? Hey, uh, we just thought we'd come and talk a little bit, talk a little bit about the day. Okay, yeah. How's the morning going? We're out of money. Okay. Uh, what do you mean? The houses aren't selling. Right, but, ladies, in English, what do you mean? So we need to sell more and get more money or this business is over. Listen to me. My daddy always used to say, "Don't ever sell the business. Even if you have to fire your best employees, even if you have to fire Jennifer and Kelly, don't sell the business." I mean, word for word, he said that? He said, "Even if you have to burn down the property and claim insurance, never sell the business." We said, "Oh, we ran out of lights. Oops, I knocked over a candle. Oops, that candle happened to be next to a trash can full of gas." - Okay, let's... - We know you're stressed. But I think I have an idea to save us. Okay. Here we go. Let's go, Knox. Okay, little harder, little harder. Okay, that was terrible. One more. - All right, Kaylee, come on. - Mr. Duke? - Come on. - Uh, we're with Village Homes Tiny Homes. - Hey, how's it going? - Creek Thompson's old business. Yeah? What do you want? We have a business proposition. Okay, hold on a sec. Hey, guys? Why don't you guys go ahead and do some push-ups and sit-ups back there? Drop down, give me 120. - Butcher Duke. - Jennifer Calloway. Lovely to meet you. Kelly Anderson, hi. - What's going on? - We want to invite you to a big tennis rematch event, this time against Delta Thompson. And if you beat him, you will win a tiny home. Okay. So... Think about it. - Think about it. - What? What do you mean? Do I... You're gonna call me or... I'll call... It's not every day you get a second chance to play tennis for a tiny home. What will Butcher do? What the hell's a tiny home? You've got to go for it. What if I lose again? So, you already lost. No one can think of you any less. Once you've hit rock bottom, there's only one way: up. Okay, that's my line. All right, have you ever had your heart ripped out on the tennis court? I was this close to winning a double-wide mobile home, and I lost and it hurt. We lost every match last year. We're still showing up, though. I mean, you live with your mom, Butch. You got to go for it, Butch. So you guys really think I got a shot? Yeah. - Really? - Yeah. Like, seventyish percent. - Fifty. - Thirty-five. - Yeah. - Thirty-five, yeah. Not as good as I wanted, but... Here he comes, the challenger! Out to win a manufactured home tonight: Butcher Duke! Go, Butcher! Go, Butcher! Duke! Challenging Butcher Duke to a tennis match and the winner gets a tiny home, so... - Babe, look, it's Delta. - And will the match be in one of the tiny homes? Yeah, wasn't he, like, a grade above us? - Yeah. - June, I love you. Uh, you're great, uh... Didn't you date him? - No, I dated you. - Oh. ...the home that Butcher Duke will be winning? Babe, look, it's your dad. Hold on! - Hey! - I'm sorry, sir, this is a live... This thing rolling? I'll tell you something. I'm Butcher Duke. I lost a mobile home opportunity 20 years ago. Not this time. It means something this time. I lost my daughter. I haven't talked to her in two years. My wife's dead, she died in a mudslide. Okay, I live with my mom. I'm 45. It's embarrassing. I've been in anger management for 18 months, but I'm a different person. So I'm here, and I'm here to tell you, June, I accept this challenge. Yes! - You look good today, June. - Thank you. Thank you. This is gonna be a fun match because you're gonna watch a young buck just pounce on an, uh, older man, uh... Oh, this is clearly getting kind of emotional. - It's all right. - What'd you say? Oh. Boys, we don't need to bring this to a violent place. - I'm gonna grab him... - Pan in, pan in, pan in. Good. All right. Like I said, I've been in anger management now for 18 months. I almost hit him. I wanted to hit him, but that's... Why aren't you more excited? Your dad is on TV right now. He's playing for a tiny home, babe. That's no small thing. I mean, it's a small house, but it's no small thing. - You think I can beat Delta? - I do. I've always thought you could do anything you wanted to do. You know that. I just wish Kathy was here, you know? - I miss her. - I miss her, too. I want to talk to Emily. Oh, well. Maybe winning a tiny home will change everything. Everything okay there, Butch? Seem a little quiet. Yeah, I'm just... ...just really missing my wife today. Hm, I didn't know you were married. Oh, I'm not. She died in a mudslide. It's just hard, you know? Yeah. I mean, it could be worse, right? She could've died in, you know, volcanic molten lava, you know, like my cousin Steve did. Wait a second. Where are we, Gordy? You know where we are. We're at your dead wife's grave. How do you know where my wife is buried? Go to her, Butch. Hey, Butch? It's not that one. It's the one over there. Yeah. Ah! Well, how'd you think I was hitting? I mean, I think you're hitting pretty well. You got a couple days left. I'd keep working on your backhand. - Yeah. - Just keep drilling. - Serve is okay, though, right? - Yeah. - I feel good about the serve. - Looking good as ever. - Yeah. - Maybe better. Ah, thanks, man. Yeah. So, what's the latest with you and Emily? - How are you guys? - She's getting married, man. - Wow. - I didn't even know she was engaged. You know, apparently, he's some, you know, state champion paintballer. I guess that pays these days. You know, people gamble online, they can play paintball, make mon... I don't get it, know what I mean? You know, I just... yeah. Well, I don't... I don't mean to be a big advice giver, but just don't give up. - Yeah. - Don't give up. I can't, man. She's all I got. Dang. Ooh, okay, I already like this one. Okay. - It's pretty good. - It's doughy. Look at this one. It's got a remote to it. - Oh, it's like a hospital bed? - Yeah. Like, soft and firm. Oh my gosh, I don't know if I'm gonna be able to get out of this. Like, I legitimately... I don't know. It's like putting my face in, like, a lamb's belly. Whoa, look at this giant one. Can we get the huge one? I feel like royalty. I feel like I should have, like, jewels just draped around me. Yeah, this one is nice too 'cause, like, when I'm mad at you, I can be on my side and I don't have to touch you. Look how many kids we can fit in this bed. Oh my God, no, please. - Whoa. - Oh, man. - That's it. - You ready? Yes. Robobed. Oh, let's wake up, the baby is crying. Uh-oh, "Wah, Mom, I need milk, Mom." The pregnancy joke is funny when I make it, not you. Going back to bed. I can't wait to live with you. Me neither. Hey, Jennifer, thanks again for staying late. I mean, that's what I'm here for. How's the training going? Oh, it's great, you know. Uh, my forehand, great. Backhand could use a little work. And I'm gonna surprise him on my serve, I'm telling ya. That's good to hear. - Thanks so much. - Yeah, of course. - Can I show you something? - Yeah. So, this is one of my favorites. His name is Wilburforce. They call him The Force because he... oh! You see that? Gets him at the hip, but guess what, he's gonna get back up. He's a little squatty, a little scrawny, but that's what I like about him. He's energized, he's ready. Oh! Gets to jump over, leaps over him. Pulls back, he leaps over him. Ah, oh, yeah. Ooh! Oh! Oh, wow! Hot dog. I don't know about you, but that gets me jazzed. Yeah, I mean, I went to a WWE match... - Whoa, professional? - Yeah. That's amazing. Man, Jennifer, I just... I can't believe I'm asking you this, but if I can, after all this is over, take you out to dinner somewhere nice like Cheddar's? - Yeah. - Yeah? Yeah, I'd really like that. Man, hot dog! You did it, Delta, you asked her. Yeah, I should probably get that. - Yeah, I'll... - All right. See you, Jennifer. - Have a good evening. - Yeah, you too. Oh, hey, uh, Village Homes. Delta Thompson speaking. Oh, tiny homes, no, no, no, you can be normal sized in a tiny home. Up. Toss above the head. Okay? So let's take a look at you guys. Okay. The serve is the most important part of the game. Okay. Okay, that's enough. There you go. Close, close. Last year, you hit rock bottom. Where do you go from here? - Up. - Up, that's it. Okay, here we go. What? Oh, almost, Kaylee! All right. Good job on the serves. All right, so as you guys know, do you remember what Faith's goal was? - Between the legs? - Between-the-legs shot. Okay, that's good. Oh, that's close. - Hm. - Did it make it? You think we should make you another goal? - Yeah. - John? You want to show us what you've been working on? Um, so, yeah, I've been working on some poetry, so I thought I could share it with you guys. "Tennis racket, tennis racket, I don't like you very much. You think you're great, but you're not great and stuff. You make me feel like it's hard to hit you. But, Trish, you know, I could never quit you." - Woo! Yeah. - Woo. Hey there, welcome to Delta Thompson's virtual tour. Delta, you got this. Hey there, welcome to Delta Thompson's virtual tour. I'm your host, Delta Thompson. Sure, sure, a tiny home can most definitely fit four dogs, abs... absolutely. I don't know why you're doubting that. This is our Colorado B-style house. This thing is high. Wow, it's long. Holy moly, and it's a tiny home. Are you kidding me? Do you not know what APR financing is? You can see this thing is full of ample space. I'm talking square feet upon square feet upon square feet. You come on down here, you come on down today, I'll give you a tour myself. Full-blown kitchen with a working sink, running water. Okay, it's not working right now. That's a love seat for when you got those couples. Leopard blanket not included. Even rich people can't afford homes that withstand hurricanes, okay? Full-on medicine cabinet. That's right there... uh-oh, scary movie! Scary movie! It's just me. Scary movie. Hey, ladies and gentlemen, I just want you to subscribe to my channel. It's right here. Yes, a mobile home is a... Okay, okay, well, if you want to call me that, then... That was not very good. Do you ever just have a tough day? How do you get through that? What's the worst... ...worst day you've been through? Oh, there's been a lot of them, but you go home, you sleep it off, and you come back recharged. Yeah. Don, what's it like to love someone for so many years? It's pretty good. We want to serve you... ...quality homes... ...today! Are you tired of people saying you have a lazy eye? He is so hot. When I was a little hijo, people used to make fun of my lazy oho. So come on down to Abe's Eye Repair. Get rid of that lazy eye and get yourself... Ooh, I bet he smells like olive oil. Kind of not what I expected. Wait. I think this is it. Yeah, definitely. It's him. Cut! This is a cool place. Wow, it's like a thrift shop, but, like, professional. I'm kind of in the middle of something important. - Can I help you? - Kelly Anderson. Jennifer Calloway. Lovely to meet you. Village Homes Tiny House. Are you familiar with the Village Homes Tiny House? No idea. Introducing Wilburforce. A local hero who happens to be the most famous part-time minor league wrestler in town. - Our boss... - ...is a huge fan. - Makes sense. - And he's participating in the biggest tennis match of the season. And what we want you to do is be the preshow entertainment. And what does this "preshow" entertainment entail? Before the show, you'll be entertaining the audience. As in... You will be wrestling volunteers from the audience for 30 seconds, just... Bam, bam, bam! We know a lot about wrestling. Yeah, no, you don't, but... Hm. You know what? I'll do it. Nice doing business with you. - Thank you, ladies. - Our hotmail is on the card. So, guys, I'm gonna teach you the poach today. Does anybody know what the poach is? - No. - No one? - The egg. - There's a poached egg. Has anybody ever poached a whale off the coast of Madagascar? - No. - Well, I have, okay? Let's keep that between us. Okay, John, you're gonna start. This is the poach. Boom! Did you see that? You guys think you can do that? - Yeah. - Okay, Friday, when we play this match against Ramsey, they're not gonna be expecting it. Okay? Rackets up, get excited. You're gonna want to aim right there. See Knox's belly? Just right in the center, okay? Come on. Yes! Yes. When she becomes the cougar, you become the leopard. Right? Cougar, leopard. Now go get it, go get it. Whoa! What the... - Did you see that angle? - Yeah. Oh my gosh! Right here. All right, bring it in, right here, bring it in. Let's go, let's go. Who... who are we gonna celebrate today? - Me? - Kaylee. On three, "Kaylee." One, two, three, Kaylee! - Hi. - Hi. Is there anything in particular you're looking for? Well, primarily rackets and some balls and maybe some snacks. So, just like that, yeah. Ooh, oats and honey. Yeah, I'll take all these. - What do these do? - Uh, those go over the grip. Yeah, I'll need five of these. I'll take this. Basket of balls, all right. - Okay. - And... Cool, uh... You know, I have a girlfriend. - You do? - Mm-hm. - Well, good. - Yeah. Glad to hear that. Do you, uh, do you have any advice for me? Well, women really like to be listened to. Do you have any other advice besides listening? 'Cause it's hard for me to do that sometimes. Do you have a sense of humor? - Women like sense of humor. - Okay. - What's your name? - Wendy. I'm Delta. Delta Thompson. - Knock-knock. - Who's there? - Interrupting cow. - Interrupting... Moo! - Hey! - Hey! How's it going? Oh. - Nice to see you again. - Good to see you. Um, I thought maybe we could just hit some balls. - Yeah, that sounds good. - And I got some snacks. - Oh, awesome. - Oats and honey, and these are some baked fish. - Thanks. - Yeah. Let's head this way. Let's... let's go. Yeah, I hard-boiled an egg this morning. Oh, wow, was that your first time? No, I do that every morning. Typically, I try and do a soft boil or a medium boil. I can never get the soft boil right. - One. - Two. Sorry, that was a little high. Three. Sugar! - Okay. - One. Two. - Three. - Four. Oh, we almost had five! Hey, you did pretty good out there. Thanks. You weren't too bad, though. Oh. You might want to get a lesson, though. It wouldn't hurt. Yeah. Yeah, that's a good idea. Knock knock. Ellis, Emily, welcome. Glad you're here. Well, how'd you guys meet? - Tell me how you met. - Uh, was it freshman year - of high school? - Freshman year of high school, I'd eaten some really old chicken fingers - for breakfast, and... - Yes. But, we were in line getting food, and he, instead of puking, like, on his tray, he leaned over and puked on mine. Well, now that's kind of romantic, a little, - isn't it? - Yeah. - I think so. - Kinda cute, - puked on the first date. - But... I played it off pretty well, I thought. Oh, good, well who's got the debt? Who's got the debt here? - Sorry, debt? - Yeah, every counseling situation I come in, one of the two has debt, so who is it? - I don't have any debt. - That's good. - And I don't think you... - But, what...? Um, I was only talking about, 'cause I have some loans I took out. - Just the ones... - Oh, like, you still have - those loans? - I mean, like, you know, I have the credit paid for my house, and, like, car payments. You're gonna have, like, some debt. I mean, everyone has debt. - No. - Right, it's like a... - It's a fairly com... - Not everyone. No, that's a fairly common thing. - No. - How much debt is it, Emily? The number? - A few thousand. - A few thousand? - 50,000. - $50,000 in debt. - Okay. - Oh, God. All right. Well, why didn't you tell me you had that much debt? - 'Cause that... - My dad never taught me how to, like, manage finances, so I don't know - what you're expecting. - Okay, this is something we've got to work on, obviously. We can work on it. So, how do you guys feel about pets? - Um. - Do you want them?

Oh, the Colorado, I like that. Yeah, it's Colorado because in Colorado they have a lot of trees, and this is completely made out - a lot of wood. - I like the... I like the pine and the lighter floor that kinda gives it more of an open feeling. - Sure, yeah. - Now, is this Formica, or, um...? Uh, I don't know who it's for. But, I'm not sure, I don't know who Mica is. - And this bathroom? - The teenagers often come in and take dookies at night, but we try and prevent that, and we'll get you a clean one before.

It's kind of like, you see, we're working better - as a team. - So, no... okay, whoa, whoa, whoa. So, Delta and I are not playing? - Oh, oh, no, no, no. - Singles?

Delta changed the rules from singles to doubles, and I need a doubles partner, so please, will you be my doubles partner? - No. - No? Dad, I haven't played tennis in like nine years. Uh, like that matters. Come on, you can pick it up. Please, this is hard for me to come here and ask. Look, I'm sorry, it's just not gonna happen.
