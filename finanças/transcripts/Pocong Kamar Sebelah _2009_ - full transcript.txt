Ma'am. You are Mrs. Ratmi, right? -So you're the one who called? -Yes, Ma'am. Come on. This is your room. Do not enter that room... ...during your stay here. And why is that? -Good morning, Ma'am. -Morning. Last night, I heard a woman crying in the next room. You need to stay away from that room. What's wrong with that room? Who lives there and why was she crying? It's none of your business. Just do as she says. Aren't you studying economics? In Nusa Dua University? Do you know me? -I'm Randy. -Felisa. I'm also a student at Nusa Dua University, majoring in sociology. I'm Mrs. Ratmi's son, the landlady. It has been two years since we opened that room's door. I'm late. I have to go now. Bye. You should leave that spooky house. The thing is, I've already paid for a whole month. So do you prefer being haunted than losing your money? Shit. I've got an appointment with Mr. Lukman in his office. -See you later, guys. -See you. I'm sorry. Here's your book. Thanks. Keep your mouth shut, or I'll kill you. You know what, guys, I've been wondering... ...why they keep the room locked. For two years! I bet they're hiding something inside. I can tell from the way she panicked. You're right. Should I unlock the door? No, you shouldn't. I don't think it's a wise act. Do I really need to act wisely? -Hey. -Hey. There will be a special performance by DJ Rony at Skyclub tonight. Shall we go together? Sorry, Ran, I'm tired. I want to rest. We can go for an hour. It's not that long. Maybe next time? I can't go now. Sorry. Bye. Stay away from that room. Don't be afraid. I'm Udin... ...the gardener. Yes, sir. Excuse me, sir. Easy, it's me. Something's not right. It is here. Someone must have unlocked the door. Be careful. Ma'am? I've warned you to stay away from that room! But you didn't listen to me and you unlocked the door! I did that because... If something bad happens, it's on you. -What do you mean? -You'll know soon enough. Why does your mother insist on keeping me away from that room? I just don't understand. I always hear someone crying in that room at midnight. We'll talk about it later. -Hey. -Hey. So you're staying here? I am. Me too. Where's your room? On the second floor. Next to the forbidden room. Oh, I see. -Are you heading to campus? -Yeah. Shall we go together? -Okay. -Great. Let's go. You shall not bring harm to man. All the spirit creatures shall sleep. You shall sleep and shall not bring harm to man. You shall sleep and shall not bring harm to man. The spirit has been set free. And now, it is hunting down its victims. You're just being paranoid. There's no such thing as ghosts today. Pocong? You should go and see a doctor. I think you're losing it. Look, just like you, I didn't believe in ghosts. But what happened last night... ...made me realize that pocong are real. There's no such thing as pocong. Take my word for it. Or have you gone mad? Fine. Pocong aren't real. Satisfied now? -I've got to go now. -Bye. Where is my key? You can stay in my room for the night. Oh, hi. I'll take the couch. Or I can sleep in the living room if you're not comfortable with it. Change your clothes. -I'll wait outside. -Thanks. This is all your fault! I'm sorry, Ma'am. I just wanted to help. I hear someone crying every night. And now it haunts the house, and it is after you! What's going on? What is it, Fel? It's okay if you don't want to tell me. Shall we go now? Yeah. Fel, pocong aren't real. I know it. But I saw it with my own eyes. And it has been haunting me ever since I entered that room. You must've had something on your mind. I think you're just seeing things. I swear I saw it, and I saw it here too. I think you were hallucinating. If you don't believe me, fine. Sorry, Fel. I didn't mean to doubt your word. Look. I've been staying in that house for two years. And nothing happened to me. It is such a creepy old house... ...and the landlady, Mrs. Ratmi, is not a warm person either... ...but there's nothing to worry about. Just relax. Do not give it too much thought. Okay. Mr. Udin? Come on, Fel. It has nothing to do with that ghost you told me about. Mrs. Ratmi told me that... ...it would be hunting down its victims once I opened the door. And it's true. That ghost killed Mr. Udin. He wasn't killed by the ghost, Fel. Then who killed him? Some robbers? What would they get for robbing a gardener? I don't want to be the next victim. Come on now. I'll always be by your side, no matter what, okay? I'm moving out. Sure, but you need to calm down. Where are you going? I'm moving out, Ma'am. Sir... ...she's the one who opened that door. You see, wherever you go... ...it will always haunt you. And you will be the next victim. -But why? -Because she opened that door. Are you saying that I must stay here? Yes. -For how long? -Until it's gone to where it belongs. What should I do? There's only one way. What is it, sir? To release its ties. Whose ties? There's a grave of a woman... ...behind that room. The ties over her shroud are not yet released. -Who is that woman? -You don't need to know. Who will release its ties? You. -But why me? -Because you opened that door. And remember... ...you have to do it on a Friday night (Kliwon)... ...when there is a full moon. You can't leave this house. Keep that in mind. Why me? So, I have to go to that grave on Friday night, alone... ...to release its ties. How can I help you? You can't help me. Nobody can. Marvin! Marvin, I saw the ghost in my room! I'm scared. Calm down. There are no ghosts. Here, sit down. Fel, fear comes from our minds. -What do you mean? -I mean... If you think about something scary... ...you'll get scared. If you think about something fun, you'll be just fine. I'll tell you what... Why don't we go check on your room together? Okay? Come on. There's nothing inside. See? There's nothing here. Why don't you believe me? Fel, it's all in your mind. You shouldn't take Mrs. Ratmi's word too seriously. But I'll be the next victim. No, you won't. Unless, you think so. Then what should I do? You should relax. How can I make you relax? Fel... ...it's not your fault. This is all your fault. My mother was hurt and sent to hospital. -You are responsible for this. -Why me? Because you opened that damn door and set the ghost free. Mr Udin had died... And now it got my mother. Who will be the next? You or me? Hey, don't talk like that! Watch your mouth! It's none of your business. Stay out of it. Enough! Stop it already! Tonight, you must release its ties. Unless you want to die. Marvin, I'm not crazy. I'm frightened. -I don't have the guts to do it. -Then you shouldn't. But if I don't do it, I'll be the next victim! I'm caught between a rock and a hard place. Fel... Please, can you give me a moment? I need some time to think. Please. All right. Ma'am, is something wrong? You should rest up. -What's going on? -We should release the ties. -Now? -Now! Go! Go! You just moved in? -Yes. -I can give you a hand. I'm okay. Thank you. -Just let me help you. -I've got it. I'm okay, really. Thank you. Then what should I call you? -Ratna. -I'm Marvin. -I should go. -Wait. If you need anything, just come to me. My room is just around the corner. Thanks. Hey. Where are your manners? You should've knocked before entering my room! -I just want to get to know you. -You jerk! -You don't need to play hard to get. -Get out of my room! Get out! You stupid girl. You filthy whore! She hanged herself. We must bury the dead body. We can't let the other lodgers know about this. They'll be terrified and leave. Hurry. Feli!
