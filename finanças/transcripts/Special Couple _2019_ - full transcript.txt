Where is he? Tian, I'm back. Where are you? Your tour went on way too long. We sold out. We added more concerts. Tissue. Hand me some tissue. Have you not wiped yourself since I left? Here. It's your turn to cook. But I just got back. It's Thursday, your turn. Is this your new song? Have you sorted out your visa? Not yet. You're crazy. Why leave the most important thing until the last minute? I've booked an appointment for 2 p.m. tomorrow. Don't mess it up. Your parents left me this long-winded message, like some kind of mission. Listen to it. Jin Tian! Dabai keeps ignoring my calls. You need to keep an eye on him. Remind him to extend his visa. Please remind him three times a day. - Right. - And once every mealtime. No! Actually, four times. - And once more before bed. - All right. I get it. By the way, while you were away, I sent out some demos for you. They all replied. I've read them already. My demos were all rejected. Not one person liked them. But there is one more. Maybe this is the lucky one? No way, it's hopeless. Take a look. No, I refuse. Billy Cook. You sent Billy Cook my demo? The Billy Cook! Who's Billy Cook? Only the most famous music producer in the country. It's taken three years. Do you think this is my big break? I've got no idea. All I know is that he invited you to an audition in 18 days. You're messing with me! How dare you! You must be joking. It's Billy Cook! - Someone's going insane. - Yes, I'm freaking out! Will your parents be okay with our relationship? They'll be fine. But I have Xiao Qi. I've sent them Xiao Qi's videos. They like her a lot. They even want us to get married soon. What's in your pocket? Hand over your money. I don't have anything! - Say that again. - I don't have money! Are you sure? Let's have a look then. I don't. I've asked you nicely. Give me some freaking cash, mate. Give me some freaking cash! Let him go! Listen to me, mate. Yes? If I were you, I will take you and that silly backpack and I will get going. Because this is none of your business. Do you understand me? This is none of your business. Run! What? Just run! Chase after them! Come on! Hurry up! Split up! Go! You don't look so smart now, mate. Stand back! I'm warning you. I'm warning you. No! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Don't move! - Stay where you are! - Stay right where you are! We're here to see Gu Dabai. Who? Gu Dabai. You go and find Dabai. I'll deal with the paperwork first, okay? Okay. Hey, what's up? I heard you were rescued by a Panda Man. This is nothing. Listen. You haven't lived if you haven't been arrested. We've got a lawyer. It's a very simple case. Tian. I missed the appointment. Jesus Christ, dude. What the heck have you done? They're totally closed now. I know. So I'm screwed, right? Not yet, it's not over. There must be a way. I'll sort it out. Sorry. I should've knocked. Seems like you're also aware of Dabai's visa situation. Dabai. You're here illegally. And they're going to deport you. Maybe he can set up a business? I don't know. - Maybe a music teacher? - Yes. There's not enough time for that. I'm sorry. I can't leave. I really can't. You see. My parents spent seven or eight months saving up for a trip to come here and see me. If something happened to me now, like being deported from the UK, how would they feel? I couldn't bear it. - For the Chinese, dignity is everything. - Right? Right, this is going to send your parents straight to the ICU. What should I do? And don't even mention Billy Cook. He's... I was so nearly there. Just one tiny little step. I... You could always get married. What? Well, why not? You're such a great couple. Oh, you thought... Great idea! Dabai. Marry me. I have a UK passport. Marry, your foot! Us getting married? You must be crazy. No way, not going to happen. Please excuse us for a moment. Okay. It's a big step. You understand. Yes, absolutely. What are you saying? There is no "big step." It's not a thing. Are you insane? There is no step for anyone. Calm down! It would be a lie. They don't know that. They think we're a great couple. Us? A great couple? That's ridiculous! Crazy! It's not going to happen. We're straight. Do you have another solution? For your parents' sake, for your musical dream, if I were you, I'd do everything but leave. Am I right? It's true. But... What then? Do you have any other ideas? Do you? For once, just listen to me! Let's get married. Mr. Gu. This is your deportation order to... Dabai. Marry me. Don't look. It's embarrassing. Are we really getting married? It feels really wrong. Don't worry. We've known each other for 20 years. I've checked the rules. We'll be facing severe consequences if they find us guilty. Hey, nobody will know except you and me. How would anyone know? It's private. What about the marriage between you and Vivian? For you, I would have to wait. That's my mate! Okay, gentlemen. Your registration is complete. If after 28 days, there are no objections, you will come here. You will take an oath and then you will officially become a legal couple. A bit emotional. Was it boys? Well, you're all done now. We're all set for a little appointment at immigration next Monday. Prepare well, okay? Now, cuddle up. We need a picture. This is an important moment in your life. Boys, come on. Lovely. Congratulations! So, immigration starts investigating now, right? What should I do? They say clothes maketh the man. We need to get some clothes. I know a place. What place? Soho! Let's go shopping. Tian, why do we need to buy new clothes? For our performance. Where's the key? In my pocket. Not that one. The left? No, not the back pocket. Can you feel it? Yep. What? What's that? It's the Panda Man. I told you there was a Panda Man! You must have a special relationship with that panda. It came to you. Hi there, I'm Hermione! I just moved in next door. Why is this foreigner dressed up like that? - She must be crazy. - Yes. Actually, you guys are the crazy ones. Also, in this country, you're the foreigners. Oh my gosh, she speaks Mandarin. - A Taiwan accent, she's no foreigner. - She's not. What's the matter? Can't my grandma's grandma be Taiwanese? Of course she can. Of course. Urgh. Don't judge me. I wear this costume when I teach fencing. It helps the kids concentrate. Oh, right. Right. So you're the one who took on that gang the other day. I didn't recognize you. You weren't dressed up so fancy. It's all because of you. My guitar got broken. And I was arrested. And my visa... I just wanted to hand out a little justice. Anyway, no one told you to stick around. I was also on the side of justice. I had no reason to run away. Come on, the truth is you never actually got the chance to run. Funny? Quite funny. What? Hello, my name is Jin Tian. Let's take a picture. I'll do it. Do it. Come on, cuddle up. Smile. Please, give us one more chance. Please! Amitabha. Buddha, please bless me. - What are you wearing? - My lucky tie. I bought it from Chinatown. It will work for sure. Excuse me. What are you writing down? We... We haven't begun yet, have we? Observe. Mr. Gu. I interpret you. Oh, I think this setting is making me a little nervous. Your body language has already answered me so many of my questions. - Let's get started. - Right. When and where did you and Gu Dabai first meet? The first day of kindergarten. Oh! Was it love at first sight? No, no, we were five! Our love came later. It was a slow burn. It seems you've been together for a long time? Many years. Yes. Then why didn't you apply for the domestic partnership sooner? It seems that you only applied after you were required to leave the country. You know how these things are. No, I don't, Mr. Gu. That's why I'm asking. Well... Marriage didn't seem relevant at the time. And suddenly I get these deportation papers and only then did we realize that we can't be apart. Can you speak Chinese? A little bit. Fantastic. I don't know how to translate it. We are made for each other. We are so happy together. There is a poem. In the sky, we'd be two love birds. On land, we're two intertwined trees. Intertwined from spring to spring. You got it, right? Good. So... Write it down. Don't just listen. Write it down, please. You must write that poem down, please. So you applied to get married in order to remain in the country? To remain in the country, to be with Jin Tian, yes. I see. So this is true love that we are dealing with. Is it? True love, love. I love him. That's why I have to marry him. Can't say I'm very convinced by you, Mr. Gu. I hereby give you notice that I will be investigating your case thoroughly. You're free to go. Thank you. How was it? Dealing with a devil would be easier. But I think it worked. She's pretty, right? She's nothing. The one I had was the real devil. It's because of the lucky tie. Screw you. How did you get on? Just fine. - Yes. - Well, good luck. Mr. Watson will be popping round to the flat for his first visit the day after tomorrow. Mr. Watson? Don't worry, he's a very efficient investigator. I'm sure he will wrap up your case very quickly. And I've picked out a very lovely hat for the wedding. This is all wrong. Let's try it again. No more. This just isn't your thing. Let's find another way. What other way? Hello, Charlie? Are you working tonight? Great. I need your help. You're so familiar with this place. Are you a regular? No way! He's my client. Yes, right. Why are they all looking at me? You're a handsome guy. That's all. You find yourself a seat. I need to say hi first. Are you leaving me alone? Relax. I'll get drinks. Hey, Charlie! You're here! Only took you two years. Welcome to my kingdom. This place is popping tonight. Can I buy you a drink? I'm here with a friend. But thank you. Leave him alone, Keith. He's just a tourist. I'm just being friendly. Yes, well. Go take your friendly somewhere else, my love. This one's taken. Pity. Something strong for you. And your friend. Off you go. Tian. So, can we leave now? What's the rush? We're just getting started. At least finish your drink. Sure. I finished it. Let's go. Why are we here? To learn. I know. I've already learned everything. No joking around. Let's be serious. Look. They are different from what we think. Look at their eye contact. Eye contact? Watch and learn. Do you understand? We need that moment when sparks fly. Oh, I'm sorry. What did you do? I just can't help it. I didn't mean to. It's not going to work! No, you can't blame it on me. It's how I am. Stupid reaction! - Be more serious. - Okay. - Work on your feelings. - Okay! This is the first year we're in love. No, that's not right. It's the first year we met. Try to remember our childhood. Did you get that feeling? Yes! - Come on! - Come on! Okay, that's it. Class over. He Min. Are you looking for something? Well, Jin Tian has fallen asleep. So I'm here to practice my guitar. Am I bothering you? He Min. What are you looking for? Do you need any help? Why aren't you talking to me? He Min? Did I say something wrong? Ouch. It's fine. Just get some rest. Don't leave! Is he okay? Is he hurt? Does he have a concussion? Nope, he just peed his pants. - What? - He's very delicate. Oh, dear. It's all my fault. I've had this problem since I was a kid. When I'm under pressure, I sleepwalk. We should be careful then. Take this, just in case. Are you serious? Just in case. Oh by the way! Is your fencing class still accepting students? I'd like Xiao Qi to take some classes. She'd be interested. Sure, you don't need to pay for it. I owe you guys. Bring him along as well. Sorry, I have to take this. Hello. Dabai, can you make it or not? I hope you remember the home visit! Don't leave everything to me! I'm dog-tired. What did you say? I said I'm a tired dog. I'm worse than you. I get it, but my rehearsal hasn't finished yet. Five minutes. Who are you talking with? The landlord's dog, Lovely Knight. He comes every day for snacks. I'll send him home in a minute. Dabai! Dabai! Hurry up! Fine, I'll be home soon. He just hung up on me. Jerk. Not you darling. Knight. Let's go for snacks. The pipe broke whilst I was showering. - Can I use your bathroom? - No problem. Let's hope your pipe stays broken. - It's cold. Where's the bathroom? - Over there. It's lovely. Thank you, Ms. Jin. What? "Ms. Jin"? No! Wait a minute. Could you do it later? It's not a great time. The handyman will be here soon. Could you let him in, please? Thanks. Wait! She doesn't think that I'm a guy. It's okay for me to go in. Darn it, I'll just go. You should've come earlier! Come here and get started. Okay. Now there's a girl in my flat. How am I going to explain that? - I have no idea. - Come on. Why didn't you bring any tools? Pardon? Wait a minute. Thank you. You need a new washer. Why have you smudged your nail polish? Yes, it's just ruined. I wanted it to look so good. It's my first time. I've never done this before. There you go. Fixed. Oh good, thank you! What's the damage? That will be 10,000 pounds, please. What? I'm Mr. Watson from Immigration. What? Please. Thank you. I'm so sorry about this. It's messed up. I just thought... Well, you fixed the pipe. The smell of your shampoo is lovely. Where did you get it? She's our neighbor. Yes, I got that. Hermione. This is the immigration officer, Mr. Watson. I should go get changed. Okay, bye. Bye. I fixed your shower by the way. Oh. You can sit down. Excuse me. Sorry. Finally, you're back! - What happened? - Total disaster! I didn't recognize him! - I was totally blind. - Don't panic. Gentlemen, could you speak English, please? Terribly sorry. Lovely to see you. - Hello. - Hello. Well then. I think it would be reasonable for me simply to come clean. This silly billy decided on these ridiculous outfits. He thought it would make us look more gay. As usual, Jin Tian went the extra mile. All made up. To play the girl. Which is... Jesus, I'm so embarrassed. I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Watson. And it must seem so absurd to you. But then again, if you don't mind me saying, Mr. Watson. Isn't it also quite absurd to investigate love between two people? Because I feel true love cannot be investigated. The door's open. I'm coming in! Why is she here? - She showered. - Dabai, you're back. Jin Tian, the pipe is completely fixed. Introduce me to him. I'd like to thank him. Speak English, please. No problem. She... She's our neighbor, Hermione and she needs to leave now. - Bye. - Bye. Bye. Bye! The truth will come out. Of course. Goodbye. Bye. Today is a special training day. Who wants to go first? Me. I've done a bit of fencing before. That's great. Then I don't need to be gentle. Slow down. I surrender! Phone. I think it's yours. Xiao Qi, is Dabai a coward? Come here. - Why? - Come. Help me. Take this for me. - Who is it? - Please. Please. - Could you play with Xiao Qi for now? - Hello? This is her friend, Dabai. No. I'm sorry. I don't know. Right. I'll be sure to let her know. What did he say? He asked where you moved to. - You didn't tell him, did you? - Of course not. But he said he left some things at your place. And he wants them back. Darn it. That jerk always comes back. This... Is Harry your ex-boyfriend? No! Don't ask. Are you thinking... We're all adults. It's not a big deal to meet after a break-up. No, I can't meet him. He knows me too well. He knows how to drag me back in. And then he flirts with other girls. I moved here because I wanted to escape from him. I shouldn't be telling you this. It's for you. Would you like to read it? You can have it. It's yours. - For me? - Yes, it's about you. Well, thank you. Hello. Did you get it done? Almost. Tian. What would you do to a bastard who cheated on your friend? Beat him up. What if you can't win? I'd scold him in Sichuan dialect. I'm not kidding. If that was me, I'd... Do you see the same line on my hand as well? Wow, that's amazing! So sorry. Um, I'll just go and take this. Hello? I'll be right back. Okay. Of course. The good old Latin love poem. Seems like he uses this trick on every girl he meets. Are you Harry's friend? Boyfriend, actually. Sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't know. It's all right, love. It's ex-boyfriend now. You seem like a nice girl. Get out. While you can. Before you get in the deep end, and have your pretty little heart... broken. Take care. Hello. Don't move. We Chinese are not cowards. Come. You really let me vent my anger. That's good. Thank you. Wait a moment. This is for you. I can't take this. I just bought a new one. This is different. It's because of me, your guitar got broken. I owe you. We are sisters. Who is it? It's Mr. Watson from the immigration office. A moment, please. - Wait here. - Okay. Hi. Hello, Mr. Watson. Thank you for fixing my shower. Pleasure, Hermione. I want to chat with you about your gentlemen neighbors. Okay. I'd like to pick your brain to see if you think they're a real couple. Of course, they are. They love each other. I wish I could have a relationship like that. It's so lovely. Hey! Stop peering into my room! Thank you, I will be fine. Thank you. Mr. Watson. I still believe that Jin Tian likes women. You mind your own business and explain yourself about the bread. Jin Tian and the bread are two separate issues. Shut up! Goodbye, Mr. and Mrs. Smith. Thank you for your very warm hospitality. That immigration officer is like a dog. Just a little sniff drives him crazy. Correct. Hey. I just realized we have a big problem. If we get through all this, after 20 days, we'll legally be a couple. Yes, I'm the husband. You're the wife. No, what I mean is we won't be able to date girls anymore. We can't have babies. Our parents won't have grandchildren. Correct. Wait! No, what? We can't have children? Exactly! We haven't thought this through. No, that's not right. You silly boy. We can always get a divorce. Right, divorce. I'm dying here. It's He Min! Is anyone home? We're here. The door's open. I'm coming in! I've made some cookies. Are you on a diet? - Nope, come on in. - Nope. - Help yourself. - They smell good. What did the immigration officer ask you? Nothing. Just some basic questions. If I were you, I'd expose this investigation on TV. You need to speak up for yourselves. We will. Don't worry. - Can I have some? - For sure. Have some! Delicious. You like them? Then I should bake more for you. Great! Delicious, right? Gosh, you're talented. Your butt is big. Don't eat too much. I'll take a big one. How much I eat doesn't affect how big my butt is. Whatever. You're up. Why is He Min so keen on us now? She does whatever she wants to. Dabai. Go get the door. Hi. Look, I'm sorry for this but my investigation requires I pay you an unannounced visit. So if you don't mind, I'll be spending the rest of the day with you, okay? So just be yourselves. Don't mind me. Today is ruined. - We're being followed by a dung beetle. - Right. Wait, if he's a dung beetle, then what does that make us? Let's get rid of him. Go. Let's split up. You get his attention. - I'll go this way. - Wait, I... Watson! Go. Go! You guys thought you could lose me, eh? Hi. Here you are. So I'll be over in a couple of minutes. - Thank you. - Take your time. Okay, guys? Okay. Mr. Watson. Please come and join us. Well no, thank you very much. I find maintaining a certain distance allows me to make more accurate observations. So I... Very welcome. You should try the organic mango salad. It's very nice. Hello? Hello? Dabai, where are you? I'm in Revolution de Cuba. What's up? I'm coming to meet you. I'll be quick. - Wait for me. - But... I need the toilet. Okay. What happened? I told Harry I had a boyfriend. He insists on seeing my new boyfriend. He's coming now. So you want me to play as your boyfriend? Can you? - Please. - All right. I'm counting on you. Okay. Harry. Harry, right? Come, have a seat. Are you the joker from the other day? You're a d♪♪♪head, mate. I'm Hermione's new boyfriend. So, why don't you sit yourself down? Cause you and I need to have a chat. Guys, what can I get you two gentlemen today? I'm fine, thank you. You're sure? But this little guy will have a small sausage with two tiny little eggs. Small sausage. Extra small. Extra small sausage and two eggs. Okay. You know what? I'm very hungry today. I'll have two portions of that, please. So cute. Thank you. So, how did you two meet? Because I've never heard Hermione mention your name. Mate, I'm not here to converse with you. You listen to me. One moment. What are you doing? Can't you just sit with me? If you keep doing this, I'll quit. Okay, I'm here now. So who's your favorite soccer player? I love Olivier Giroud. Why him particularly? He's handsome and strong. And do you have any particular hobbies? Sorry. Darn it. Pardon? Fencing! Fencing? Yes, I'm very good at it. He likes to play with his weapon. Guys, okay. Oh, I was already given... - Yes, but downstairs... - Yes, it's fine. - Yes, it's fine. Thank you. - Sure? I'm hungry. I'm really hungry today. Protein. Bon appetit! Enjoy. Are you really that hungry? Are you going to eat everything? My stomach hurts. There is no way that Hermione would be into someone like you. What makes you say that? Then where is she? I'd quite like to hear that from her own lips. Look, maybe this is difficult for you to comprehend. But she doesn't love you. So, get out of her life. Mr. Watson. I just wanted to help out a friend. So you're her gay best friend? But I don't care. You crossed the line. You left me alone to face the investigation whilst you pretend to be someone's boyfriend! Sorry, it's my fault. It's all my fault. Anyway, I won't get involved in Hermione's relationship anymore. - Mr. Watson. - Yes? I just wanted to apologize again for my behavior. I was so rude. It's fine. It's reasonable under the circumstances. That man is a d***head. But I shall have to report this incidence for reference. It speaks the picture as a whole. You see. Please don't do that. I've gathered many more pieces today. Well, I'm going to bid you farewell. And leave you to enjoy the rest of your evening in peace. Goodbye. Mr. Watson. Yep. We're actually headed somewhere else tonight. Would you like to join us? Come on, it would be fun. Yes, why not? The night is still young. Great. Let's go. Everybody, say hey! Hey! - Hey! - Hey! - Hey! - Hey! Everybody, go! - Hey. - Hey. - Hey. - Hey, Charlie. Can't stay away? I love it. This is our new friend! - Hello. - Nice to meet you. Guys. You're just in time. Show us your moves? Come on. Come on. I don't want to lose face. Good boys, let's go! Okay, move. Get out of the way. What dance should we do then? That one when we were kids. That one? Vivian! My name is Charlie, love. I'm not Vivian. Vivian. No, I'm Charlie. I'm not Vivian. All right, come on. Mr. Watson! I haven't told them about my private life. Because I didn't want it to be an issue at my work. Last night I recorded this. Vivian. I'm Charlie, not Vivian. Vivian. Vivian. Come on. Let's go. Come on. I'm Charlie. He must have been dreaming and he called out my name to do some work. He's very dedicated to his work. Always bossing me around. Well, thank you for your time. That's very informative. Thank you. It's over. Why? You seem to have some very loyal employees. Yes, I'm very lucky. Well, perhaps you are. But I'd offer you this word of warning. If either of them is lying to me or lying to help you, then they will be in a great deal of trouble. Especially your friend, Vivian. I understand the consequences. But you are wrong. Okay well, we'll leave it there. Mr. Jin, for now. Vivian. - I need... - No, you don't need to explain. I totally understand. But isn't it too risky to pretend you're gay? What a crazy idea. No, you have to listen to me. We're not pretending. Dabai and I are a real couple. This again? The officer is gone. It's time to work. - Leo is waiting for me. - Wait. If you're truly in love with Dabai, then what about us? Dabai, Vivian doesn't believe our relationship is real. Guess what? She tested me with her body. It was really out of this world. You really didn't have any reaction? Not even when Vivian's blazing red lips were this close to mine. I didn't give an inch. I pushed her away immediately. I protected myself and shut off all my senses. I'd rather die than give in. You've played this trick too many times. She won't buy it. You're right. I feel like I've lost the whole world now. It's too late for regrets. Jin Tian. I have something to say. Darn it. I quit! Don't move! Don't move! Why are you running? Stop right now! Harry. You can't talk to my friend like that. I don't ever want to see you again. Harry is not worth it at all. You see. You're so beautiful. Cute. You're so gorgeous when you're fencing. In my heart, you're perfect. Don't laugh. I'm serious. He Min? You're awake! For how long? Did you hear everything? Yep. You are perfect. But my Jin Tian is still a little bit better than you. So don't get too comfortable. Are you going to the football game on Friday? Nope, I've got something to do. With who? Is it with He Min? Why do you ask? Why are you being so sensitive? Am I? The day before yesterday. I saw you two together. I'm not like you. I behave myself when I'm with a beautiful woman. You really didn't do anything? Absolutely not. That's great. If the immigration officer found out about this, many people will get into trouble. Right, has the immigration officer talked to Vivian recently? Nope. He seems to put it on hold for a long time. Please don't drag Vivian into this. She'll get deported if we mess up. Don't say such terrible things. I won't let her get implicated. Her life is already difficult with a kid. Hello. Is anybody home? Hi there. I'm Rachel Thompson with the SUN news channel. Come on in. Hello. Finally, he's made a move. The immigration officer must have sent them. Execute Plan A. Get dressed. Thank you so much. Now, just to finish. Would you like to say a few encouraging words to the community? I'll go first. Be brave. It's not easy. But just be yourself. Don't lie to yourself or to those you love. Be who you really are. People may be against you. And there will be a price to pay. But, as long as you're true to your feelings, there should be no regrets. I don't regret anything. - Bye, thank you. - Bye! That's perfect. It seems the letter I wrote to the TV station really worked. What? Expose the problem and then fix it. I told you. Otherwise, why would they come here? Well, don't be too grateful. He Min. You've just killed us without even breaking a sweat. What? We are doomed. Doomed? What are you talking about? You're such an angel. So we have been investigating Gu Dabai and Jin Tian. They scored pretty highly in the key areas of the test. They're such a sweet couple. Well that maybe so, but... I'm still convinced that their relationship is fake. Okay, this has been dragging on for quite a long time. The TV stations have us in a very awkward situation. I'd like to get this wrapped up, please, quickly. - Yes, madam. - Yes. I got it, Mom. Bye. My parents just told me that they've got a surprise for me. They'll be here tomorrow. I had this feeling that there's something we're missing. Perfect. Welcome to our place, Mrs. Gu and Mr. Gu! Excellent. We're here! So this is your home? Feels legit. Very nice. Goodness. Not bad, not bad! So this is a basement, right? It's expensive. If the landlord didn't give us a discount, we couldn't afford it. How about it? It's not bad, right? Yes. It's not bad. So how is university? It's good. The professors seriously adore me. That's not really the point, is it? Your progress is the important thing. Dear. Stop your endless lecturing. Come, sit here. You should listen to your mom. Do you smell something? Durian perhaps? Durian. Have you eaten durians? My goodness. Look. You're still a child. You didn't grow up. Please let me do this. Where is your toilet? Thank you, Mom! Please let me do this. Good afternoon, I'm Rachel Thompson... Hey, Dad. There's a Chinese channel. Let me show you. I want to watch this. This is boring. Let me show you the Chinese channel. Let's understand their struggles. - Do you have Chinese channels? - Yes. Move aside. Isn't that... You two are on TV! What? What's this about? And you two are... It's a public service announcement to discourage people from looking down. Get off, Tian. This announcement is good. Move. Such a positive, powerful message. But why are you two glued together? It looks a bit odd. Quiet, please. I'm recording. Let me help you, Mom. No, don't move! Oh, stop bothering her. Let your mom record it. I'll send it to Tian's parents. Let them check this out. Our sons are on TV! UK TV even. You don't have to, Mrs. Gu. I'll send them an HD one. This isn't clear enough. But I've just sent it out. Mom, you haven't connected to our Wi-Fi, have you? The data charges are really high here. Let me help you connect. The signal in my room is better! It's the best. Don't lie to yourself. They know how to save money now. They've really grown up. Never, ever let my mom see this. She'll spread it everywhere. Did you recall the one she sent to my mom? It's too late. They look good, right? Yes, but the way they're sitting so close... Hello, Mom. Please listen to me! Don't play the video you just received. It's a virus. Once you open it, your bank card and everything will be hacked. So just delete it. Delete it, Mrs. Jin. Delete! Okay, that's all. Love you. Who's there? Allow me. I'll get it. Is there anyone outside? Dabai, hi! Did you see the ad? It's gone viral. We'd really like to do a follow-up. No. Sorry, it's really not a good time. Are those your parents? Can we have a chat with them? No, sorry. They don't speak English. They hardly ever speak. Bro, chill out. Don't worry. I'll translate for them. He speaks Chinese. - Who are you? - I was the one wearing a mask last time. I was an exchange student in Shenyang. I had my tooth pulled out last time so I couldn't speak. You must be from the TV station, right? Welcome them in! Don't let the nice people stand outside. Thank you very much, sir. Let's go. - Let's go. - Thank you. - Welcome. - Hello, sir. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Can I sit here? Is that okay? Please sit. Hello. Sorry, there must be a really big mix-up here. They are ready to work. Stop bothering the nice people. Quickly, move aside. Don't worry, we're just making some small talk. Shall we start now? Go ahead. Just start. Go ahead. - Our lie will get exposed. - Five! Four! - What should we do now? - Three, two. How do you feel about your son coming out? What did she say? She's asking if you support your son. Support. Absolutely, we support him. How could he succeed if we didn't do so? Watch what you say. I'm just telling the truth. We support him, absolutely support him. People should look up. Let's get He Min to screw up this interview. When western colonists invaded our country... It's already too late. But nowadays, when we come to this country, we should raise our heads and lift our chests. And stand upright. Upright! He encourages everyone to lift their chins up. And bravely face what's in front of them. So you don't think they're too open, now they've come out? So you don't think they are too open? What's wrong with openness? To be honest, his mother and I aren't familiar with all these new things. That's you, not me. No, I'm not up to date with the new trends. I don't have these kinds of new ideas. Sometimes I feel sorry about that. So, we shouldn't allow the new generation to follow the same old road. He said everyone should open up more. - Oh my gosh, he has poor Mandarin. - Open up more. Open up more. I just learned it. I didn't expect you to be so supportive. She said she didn't expect you to be so supportive of them. We absolutely support them! There is an old saying. Rely on your brothers and sons, and you will win the battle. Dabai is really loyal to his friends, just like me. He said that he's had a great impact - on his son. - Gosh, there goes your dad's integrity. The only thing we can do now is - to steal the SD card. - That's beautiful. What do you think of my answers? Terrific! - Good? - Very good. Young man, I have one more thing to add. How do I say I'm proud of my son? In English, I mean. Pride. Pride? - Pride. - Pride? Pride! Pride! Pride! For my son, - I feel pride. - Pride! Well done! How long will your parents stay? I don't know. I can't ask, can I? If the immigration officer sees them, we'll be in trouble. Mom. I have something to tell you. Come out for a second. Where's dad? He's asleep. I need to tell you something. Your dad did a body check-up a while ago. One of the indicators wasn't quite good. I didn't tell him. The doctor said that staying in a good mood will be helpful to his health. That's why we decided to come here out of the blue. We won't be staying long, just a few days more. I've contacted the doctor for his review. Don't be worried. Nothing is for sure. Keep your dad in a good mood. While we are in London. I will, Mom. After my parents left, I felt empty inside. Do you remember? The first day we came to London, we came here and talked about our dreams. It was rainy that day, just like right now. Don't be so gloomy. London is rainy all the time. You just need to open up the umbrella. We can fix anything. You're right. I get what you're saying. But it takes a hundred lies to cover up one lie. And once the lie gets exposed... I am on your side. There's nothing to be afraid of. I don't want to labor the point. But this is a very dangerous game you're playing. I do want to emphasize how serious the situation is. If I discover that you and Gu Dabai have been attempting to falsify your relationship, Gu Dabai will be deported. And you... I know I'm going to lose my permanent residency. It's not just that. Your company will be dissolved. Your employees will lose their jobs. The results for you would be far worse than for Gu Dabai. I'm really good at my job, Mr. Jin. I'm very good, indeed. Now if you ever want to change your mind, all you have to do is just contact me at this number, okay? All right, good. Goodbye. Goodbye. Would you like some water? Vivian. Dabai and I have registered our marriage. Do you expect me to believe that? You promised me that you would take care of me and Xiao Qi. There are different ways of taking care of people. My way is different. I hope you can understand my difficulties. I'll give you a clear explanation later. I can't lie to myself. I'm sorry, Mr. Jin. It's time for me to quit. Didn't you enjoy the concert? Why? You are not in a hurry to get home, right? Not at all. Shall we find somewhere to sit? Sure. What about here? Okay. I noticed that you fell asleep. How embarrassing. I didn't sleep well last night. I don't sleep well when I'm under pressure. Sometimes I will sleepwalk. But listening to music with you makes me relax. So I... Next time when you can't sleep, how about I play the guitar for you? I've had sleepless nights too! Get in the car. Let's go. Let's go. Hey. Why are you so angry? I just wanted to cheer her up. It's not what you think. Love is love. Don't be a coward. No, what do you mean? We need to keep up the act until we pass the investigation! I know! Don't you think I know that? Don't worry. It'll be fine. I promise. What makes you so sure? Promise me you'll never see He Min again. If you keep seeing her, you better get ready to go home. And don't blame me for not helping you. Tian. If we keep this up, there'll be no turning back. Hey. What if we stop pretending? Let's just tell the officer the truth. What are you saying? What about Billy Cook? What about your parents' reputation? Everything I've done will be for nothing. Right. Then what about Vivian? That's nothing. Stop worrying. I can handle it. He Min. Don't drink that. Stop. Are you okay? We are almost there. Come on. How nice would it be if you were straight. What are you doing? Stop! Stop! I beg you to stop! Gu Dabai, you're such a good man! Do 20 years of friendship mean nothing to you? I'm sorry. I don't need your sorry! You're having fun here? Have you ever cared about other people? It's all my fault. Ever since I moved here. I just keep getting you into trouble. You're such a good man. To try and solve my problems, you're investigated by an immigration officer. I'm so sorry about everything. Don't blame yourself. It's not your fault. Vivian quit her job. Leo almost lost his. And it's all for you. I bet so many people's futures are on you. Why didn't you tell me earlier? That's not the point. The point is I thought we were in the same boat. Hermione, thank you very much for agreeing to meet me again. To be honest, I believe that Jin Tian and Gu Dabai have entered into a false civil relationship, in order to illegally obtain shared permanent residency here. They are not gay! Hermione, I can tell. So I'm appealing to you to help me. Bring them to justice. Where are you going? The immigration officer has told me everything. You'd better explain it to me. He's prejudiced. He's against my marriage with Jin Tian. I know it's a sham. You could've told me from the start. I would have been willing to help. You made me feel so guilty for such a long time. Okay, that's nothing. I just want you to answer me honestly. Do you love me? I'm sorry. We should not see each other anymore. I hope you'll stop lying to yourself. Your appointment with Billy Cook is tomorrow at 9:30 am, at his company. You can start. I'm really sorry. Sorry. Sorry about that. Do you need to get that? I'm really, really sorry about this. - It's fine. - Sorry. Leo, what's up? Dabai, have you heard from Jin Tian? Are you with him? Is he with you? No, what's wrong? I've been looking all over for him. He hasn't picked up his phone. He said something about Vivian leaving for China with Xiao Qi. - What? - Taxi! Wait, Leo. Mr. Gu? I'm terribly sorry but I must leave. Are you seriously doing this? Do you have any idea how busy Mr. Cook is? Hey, it's okay. What's up? Mr. Cook. I've been your fan for years now. I've dreamt of this moment over and over again in my head. Just being here with my guitar. And the opportunity to play my songs to you. My big break. But the fact is I wouldn't even be here, If it wasn't for my best friend. He's risked everything for me. And now he's nowhere to be found. I'm sorry, but he needs me. I need to find him. I'm so sorry. That was a total waste of time. No, I like the kid. He's right. Don't neglect your friends. Thank you! Keep the change. Vivian! Dabai. Don't leave. Jin Tian did it for me. So we became gay. No, we pretended to be gay. Do you know how much he loves you and Xiao Qi? If you leave him, he'll be heartbroken. Dabai, listen to me. No, let me finish. I swear! Jin Tian is a man you can trust your life with. I swear. Get your hands off her! Hands off. Tian. What you said was right. I was terribly selfish. Can you please forgive me? You still haven't realized what your biggest mistake was. You should never let me cook breakfast again. Can't you just do it by yourself? No problem. Leave it to me. Okay, be serious. Tian, I need to find the immigration officer and end this. Dabai. Listen. Are you sure about this? Don't worry. I'm quite sure. But I need to say sorry to He Min first. I also hurt her deeply. Hey. Would you give me another chance? I want to show you a place. A very beautiful place. I need to put on my coat first. I admire you. But the investigation is over. You're free to stay. You don't have to do this. No but I do, Mr. Watson. I can't live a lie. With this lie that has hurt people I love. People who love me. It's the right thing to do, to tell the truth. You see. If you tell me your marriage is a sham, you put me in a position where I'm obliged to recommend that you'd be deported. Do you understand that? Yes, I do. Very well. One more thing, Mr. Watson. I really hope you understand that I'm the one who dragged Jin Tian into this. It's really not his fault. His company and his employees need him. It's very clear to me that Jin Tian was coerced into this by you. He's going to be fine. Don't worry. Great. You're a good man, Mr. Gu. Thank you. What? It's fine. Dabai. Marry me. What? Marry me. Okay. Congratulations. Unfortunately, you're too late. I want an appeal! You can apply for a new visa in six months. The fact that you came to someone's rescue whilst they were being attacked might just work you a favor. See? So you have 72 hours. 72 hours? Hurry, go! Go! Go! But is he still married to me? Oh, don't worry. Once Gu Dabai is deported, your marriage is void. Ladies and gentlemen, we are sorry to tell you. Due to the bad weather, your flight has been canceled. The take-off time has yet to be determined. It'll be tomorrow? - Yes, that will ruin everything. - ...because of the long delay. - We will miss the whole thing. - Please take your belongings with you - We won't make it in time. - and follow our cabin crew - What a disaster. - to board the shuttle bus through Gate 7. Sir, please sit down. We'll provide complimentary accommodation for you. Thank you. Look at you. Why are you crying? Mom, don't be sad. No, I have a family member with me. I have Jin Tian! Let me say something. Don't worry about it. Our landlord provided the wedding venue. And his friends sponsored the wedding clothes. I got that cameraman to record our wedding. The one who speaks Mandarin. Thank goodness I'm not late. Dad, I really need to run now. The wedding is starting. Love you, bye. Hurry up! - I'm coming! - Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention, please? The ceremony is about to begin. We're here to celebrate the unions of Gu Dabai and Hermione, and Jin Tian and Vivian! Great! Stop trembling. I was right. Jin Tian likes girls. Especially girls with big breasts. That's none of your business. Watch where you're looking. Say hi to your parents. That's so sweet. Are you going to cry? No, no. I'm not. I'm just so happy. Why would I cry? I'd rather laugh happily. Now here comes the big question. The ceremony is done. The flight's been canceled. As for our ticket, should we return it or not? As for London, should we go or not? Of course, we should go. We need to bring Hermione back and introduce her to our family. Do you know what this is called? It's our family honor. Got it! It's Chinese dignity. We must go. Right. One of you two together. Lovely. After six months, I'll apply for a UK visa. The train. Train. Train. What if my visa gets declined and I can't return to the UK? It's not a problem. I can come to China and be with you. Ladies and gentlemen, just ahead of us is Blackfriars Bridge. It is said if people wave at you from the bridge, it will bring you good luck! Hey! Good luck! Good luck to us all! No. Again! Dabai, I love you. Marry me. Don't look. It's embarrassing. Give me more! Ah! Why did you put it on again? Get up. Oh, I'm sorry. What did you do? I just can't help it. I didn't mean to. The immigration officer must have... - Sorry, my bad. - No problem. You say my lines and I say yours. It's "get exposed." I thought I messed up. So I... La la la la Lollipop, lollipop, lollipop
