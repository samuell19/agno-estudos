[SNIFFS, BREATHES HEAVILY] [MACHINE CLICKS] [ALARM BEEPING] [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] [EXHALING SHARPLY] [SPOON CLATTERING] [PENNY] Michael Jordan's the GOAT. He's the greatest of all time, baby. Maybe the greatest player from your time. Got six NBA championships. Six! [MAN SHOUTING IN DISTANCE] [GROANS] - You know why he's the greatest? - Why? Because he never gave up. [LAUGHS] Hold on, on. No more time, everything on the line. Nice one, Steve Nash. Steve Nash's an eight-time NBA all-star! Yeah, but now he's old and white.

Oh, not quite camera ready. Okay, yes you are, you look fine, hurry up. [LAUGHS] You've come a long way, babe, from having panic attacks any time you were called on in the first grade. Yeah, okay, so not all of us can be non-conformists like you. You were always a leader, you always stood up for... The sheeple. That's why I do what I do. - And you've always... - Fought for the underdog, baby! [LAUGHS] Case in point. Most likely to start a riot. [SIGHS] Most likely to save the world. Although I haven't managed that yet, unlike you with your millions of followers. Nothing happens overnight, girl. You just start taking risks and it'll happen in time. That's why we're streaming live for Media 4 The People. Tell my homies over at Wake Up and Smell the Bullshit what you're all about. To... bring the uncensored truth to the people. To tell the stories that the mainstream media gloss over or completely ignore. And to empower anyone of any age to stand up and make a difference. That's deep, sis. We've all got to take individual responsibility, and stand up for what's right. Or else, none of it matters. Just sayin'. Yes! Wake up and smell the bullshit, loves!

[PENNY] No. [GLENN] Good afternoon, this is Glenn Miller with Channel 13 News. We are directly over head the downtown farmer's market. [ANCHORWOMAN] Thanks Glenn. In a story that continues to develop, our own Maya Prinz is currently at the farmer's market. Maya, it looks like quite a scene down there. [MAYA] That's right, as you can see behind me, most of the street has been completely blocked off by police as they investigate this active crime scene. [ANCHORWOMAN] And we're hearing from multiple reports there was an officer involved in the shooting. Are they telling you anything about the identity of the victim or the officer? [MAYA] Well the identity of the police officer has not yet been released but we will continue to investigate this rapidly developing breaking news story and get back to you. Live from downtown, I'm Maya Prinz, Channel 13 News. [HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [VOLK] Clear everyone out. Send a team to canvas a foot pursuit. Get out! - Penny, you just sit there. - Tom, what the hell's going on? Claudia was kidnapped three days ago. Claudia? And you shot the only lead that we had. - I thought... - You thought? No, no Frank, that's the problem, you never think! You're a damn cowboy. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [VOLK] You disobeyed a direct order. Why? I vouched for you. Even when we were partners, I was the one covering your ass. Even when things got bad. - They got bad for me, Tom. - That doesn't matter now. This is my child! [PENNY] Tom. Let me help. Let me make this right. [VOLK] How? Officer-involved shooting. Mandatory two days down, Tom. [PENNY] Tom don't do this to me. [VOLK] We got nothin' because of you, Frank. Did he say anything to you? What? He said... "Ask him how it feels to lose everything." [BREATHING HEAVILY] [PHONE CHIMES] [TENSE MUSIC PLAYING] [PANTING, GASPING] [UNDER BREATH] Claudia. - [WATER RUNNING] - [GASPS] I want my daddy! I want my daddy! I want my daddy! I want my daddy! Please let me out. Let me out! Wait, wait, wait, wait, Claudia! Claudia! - [PENNY] Tom... - Take this cell phone. It's probably a burner but find where the call came from. - Well, we're gonna... - Do it! - Tom, let me help. - Just get the hell out. Tom... Go. [VOLK] Officer, put your weapon on the table. - No. - [VOLK] Frank. Put your weapon on the table. [OFFICER] No, no, we haven't gotten word yet. - [INDISTINCT CHATTER] - [HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING] [MAN] What's going on? Gotta get you back to the station, man. - IA's waiting. - [AVA] Officer! Can you tell me about Chief Volk's daughter? Get back to the press area. I'm not talking to you, I'm speaking to Officer Penny. He took Volk's daughter, didn't he? This is a kidnapping? I said get back to the press line. Do it now. And you, Officer Penny? Do you think it was smart, shooting the only guy that knows where the girl is? [BULLET CLATTERING] You have a split second to decide what to do before some jacked up asshole with a hand canon opens up the back of your skull. Maybe the guns a toy. Maybe he has mental issues. Maybe I'm about to die. A million decisions have to happen in a fraction of a second and none of them are good. What are you gonna do? Huh? What are you gonna do? You'll never know what that's like. You shouldn't judge a man before you walk in his shoes. A mile. You shouldn't judge a man until you walk a mile in his shoes. Just saying. [COMPUTER BEEPING] [AVA] What the hell, did you just see that? - [CLOVER] That was hardcore! - [AVA] Am I live? Wake up and smell the bullshit, yes! [CARTER] You're telling me you don't have an ID on the victim or the shooter? [CARTER WHISPERING] Good job this morning. Please keep the energy up. Well, Northwestern clearly doesn't have the best or brightest in journalism anymore. - Ms. Carter. - Yes? You've got to see this. - Alright, what am I looking at? - [TARA] This feed is trending. - And, why do I care? - It's live. It's the shooter, he's a cop, and this amateur reporter's gone all Nancy Drew, she's figured out that Police Chief Volk's - daughter's been kidnapped. - [CARTER] Oh God, I love the internet. This girl's gonna replace you, Tara. Get tech to grab the feed, I want this on the air, now! [CLOVER] Seriously girl, you got to watch your back. I see the crazy shit that cops do! - I'm fine, I have my camera. - [CLOVER] Okay, well, police misconduct happens every day of the week. Officer Penny was triggered, Clo. - He was unstable. - It's gonna be okay, I'm just gonna follow him and see how it goes. [BREATHES HEAVILY] Arghh! [CLOVER] Be safe. Don't do anything I wouldn't do. - [PENNY] Move! Move! - Yeah, if it gets dangerous I'll pull back out. My baby girl Ava Brooks has broken a major story! This is raw uncensored coverage, loves. Follow her live. #avarealtime! [AVA] Sorry. Move, sorry. - Is this his car? - Seriously, do you ever go away? My name's Ava Brooks. Media 4 The People Dot Com. You should know you're being live streamed to millions of people around the world right now. - I highly doubt that. - Okay, thousands. How about if I just arrest you? I'm guessing from the empty gun holster that'd be a citizen's arrest? What are the charges? Bro, what the shit? Vandalism. You broke that guy's window. - You can't do that! - I just did. That's destruction of prop... [GROANS] [BANGING ON WINDOW] Don't mind me. [EXHALES SHARPLY] I can't tell if you broke this or not. And I hope you know that if it is broken the city's buying me a new one. - And why would they do that? - Uh, because you're a cop. Not currently, as you so astutely pointed out. Fifty-eight minutes left. [AVA] Fifty-eight minutes until what? - Are they gonna kill her? - Eavesdropper, too, huh? That would be unethical. [CAR HORN HONKS] Is that them? Is that the kidnappers? Well, let's see. This is a picture of a guy. And this is a picture of a dead guy. Do you ever report the facts? Or do you just make up whatever will get the most airtime? What is your problem with people getting the truth? If that's what the media delivered, - I'd be your biggest fan. - You know what? Maybe I should stop trying to tell the truth, maybe I should start a reality TV show - called douche cop. - Okay. You can play the cop. "Bunny." - Tom... - No, Frank, I don't have time for this. You're done. - Go home. - [LINE CUTS] - Shit. - [PHONE SMASHING] Dude, you seriously need to switch to decaf. No, what I need is a car. Can't you just hotwire that one? - You watch too much television. - I don't own a TV. Of course you don't. How 'bout a car? Or do you just float around on patchouli fumes? What is patchouli? [UNDER BREATH] How old are you? Will you turn that off? It's probably not even working anyway. Please. Listen. You're right. Someone took Volk's little girl. She's in a box somewhere and she's gonna drown. And I can't let that happen. Okay, fine. Use my phone. Call him back. No, he won't listen to me now. And if he somehow managed to see a clip of my... - Outburst? - Teaching moment. - Tantrum? - Let's just say it wouldn't be the first time the media started a shitstorm for me. I would say you initiated the shitstorm when you pointed a gun in my face. Listen, the minutes I'm using to explain this to you are literally life and death, do you understand? Now, this address may be nothing but I've got to check it out. Okay. We can take my car. - But I am filming everything. - Fine. [TENSE MUSIC PLAYING] Hurry up! In a channel 13 exclusive, we're breaking with our regular programming to go live with reporter Ava Brooks and her website Media 4 The People Dot Com as she follows Frank Penny the officer involved in this morning's fatal shooting. [KAJ] That's right Jan, as this is a live feed it may contain disturbing, and possibly even graphic content. [CAR UNLOCKS] Where's the rest of it? [PENNY] I'll drive. Okay. Hold on. [CAR ENGINE REVS] You got to be kidding me. - It's zero emissions. - It's zero everything. Well, maybe you'd prefer to run, that seems more like your thing. Well, it probably be faster. [TIRES SCREECHING] All right. She's got a little something once she gets going. - Want me to Waze that address? - Wa wa? Okay, do you want to tell people where we're headed. You're telling me that what you're shooting right now on that little thing is being broadcast live on the internet? Yes, Grandpa. And other reporters who are recording live, too. [AVA] Just like me. Although, I'm guessing... all eyeballs are on us right now. - People actually watch this? - [AVA] Not all of us need failed soap stars feeding us the news between commercials for ED pills. - ED what? - Eh, you know what I'm talking about then. Knew it. Does your mother know you talk like that? Yes, sir. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] - [HORN HONKING] - [WOMAN] Whoo! Yeah! - [MAN] Whoo! - [WOMAN] Yeah! Look over here, bro! Nice ride, po-po! [WOMAN] You're famous. Does nobody respect the badge anymore? Maybe it's the sunflower. Oh, man, I am hating today so hard right now. - I'm not. - [MAN] Whoo! [TIRES SCREECH] [GASPS] [GLASS SHATTERS] [GROANS] [GROANS] - Oh, no. - [SIGHS] Okay, um, it appears there's been an accident. Again, we're watching these pictures live for the first time with you at home. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] - [MAN] Whoa! - [MAN] Check it out! Over there, check it out. [WOMAN] Did somebody call the police? [MAN] Are they okay? [WOMAN] Are there people in there? [MAN] Yeah, are they okay? [BOTH BREATHING HEAVILY] - That just happened. - Yeah. That just happened. [GRUNTS] You smell that? - It's gas. - Gas? Yeah, you know, the stuff they put in real cars. - Now undo your seatbelt. - But my car's electric! The car we ran into isn't. And three, two, one... [GLASS SHATTERS] [WOMAN] Check it out! [WOMAN] Wow! [MAN] Oh, man! Yeah, I'm here right now. [GRUNTS] [PENNY] Come on. [PENNY] Back off! Everyone, back off! [PENNY] Get out of here! Did you hear me? [PENNY] Get your hands up people! [PENNY] I don't want to have to tell you again! [PENNY] Just back off! [SIGHS] [EXHALING SHARPLY] Okay. Ava, no! This isn't the time for selfers. Look, I'm sorry about your car. I'll, uh, I'll buy you a new sunflower thing. - I got to keep moving. - No, we've got to keep moving. There's no "we." You almost just died trying to save your stupid phone. - It's a smartphone! - Look, I can't be responsible for another life, all right? - You're done. - I believe in what I'm doing. What about you, huh? You afraid of the truth? You know what I'm afraid of? I'm afraid of my ex-wife and being naked in the shower when an earthquake hits. As far as the truth is concerned, you'll just spin it into whatever sells. No, Penny! There's no editing! No advertising, no network. Whatever goes out is what my camera sees, unfiltered. So let me in. Show the people, show us what it's like to walk in your shoes. A mile. A mile. Okay. Ground rules. You got to stay out of my way, you do what I say, when I say it, and you speak only when spoken to. Understood. And you stop doing dumb things that'll get you killed. That's my job. Come on. [PENNY] I'm gonna need that vehicle, buddy. - Are you shitting me? - I'm pooping you negative. - I can't. - Sure you can, it's easy. I'm a cop. I need this truck. Wasn't that your car? - He's got a point. - You, rules. You, get out. Under no circumstances are we allowed to let customers' goods out of our sight. No exceptions. - Hey! - You can't do that! Ugh. - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm good. I'm good. You can't do that to innocent citizens! What? I thought we had a very mature conversation. - Where's the keys? - Uh, next to Riri. - Who's Riri? - The hula girl, man! You have to be nice to people, that's my rule. I'm making a new rule. You're not allowed to make rules. [ENGINE STARTS] [TIRES SCREECHING] [TENSE MUSIC PLAYING] [AVA] Okay, I don't get you. A minute ago you were like, "Just me, babe!" Now you're okay with the goddamn A-team? I thought you didn't watch TV. [WOMAN] We're all set, let's go. - What are you doing? - Getting directions. I know how to get there. What is it with men and directions? - [WOMAN] In 100 feet, turn left. - Hey, sure thing, sweet lips. Can you not talk to her like that? Shit! Background is in on Officer Penny. Let me see. We're back in the wild west, and this cowboy, Frank Penny, has a trigger finger. She has no idea who she's taken on as a partner. Add it to the header. "Will Officer Penny let another child die?" [MAN] This is one of those prank shows. - You're like a fake cop, right? - Pretty much. She's definitely like a fake reporter. [AVA] Shit. Clover says we have forty-nine minutes left. Forty-eight. Come on, let's go. Come on. Shit! What the hell's going on back there? Damn, man, you can't drive! [LAUGHS] [WOMAN] You have arrived. Oh, shit! I love it when a plan comes together. I'm out. Company policy can kiss my black ass! [JAN] Okay. We're gonna briefly cut away from our live feed and join Maya Prinz, who is with Police Chief Tom Volk. [MAYA] Chief Volk, can you confirm the suspect was shot and killed by Officer Frank Penny? [VOLK] For the record, Frank Penny is acting alone, currently on administrative leave. Now, I can assure you, that Internal Affairs will conduct an investigation into the shooting, and into the incident with the reporter. But, people, please, let's not lose focus on the task at hand, and that's the search for Claudia. That's what's important now. [AVA] So, what's the plan, officer? [PENNY] Plan? [AVA SIGHS] That's comforting. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [AVA] This is Ava Brooks reporting live from the part of the city better known for hijacking and kidnapping. Cute. [AVA] I'm here with the cop that killed the kidnapper of 11-year-old Claudia Volk, the same cop that's taken on the responsibility of saving her life.

[MACHINE GUN FIRE] [MAN] Down, get down! It's okay! [CRYING] I don't wanna die! I'm coming for you, cop! [CRYING] We have to get out of here! [PENNY] Come here. Ava, come here. - Ava. Ava, look at me. - [SOBBING] We're not gonna die. We can't die, you know why? Huh? Because that little girl needs us. She needs you, Ava. All right? - Yeah. - All right. The old Donner building is empty. If I can lead him there, you and everyone around here is gonna be safe, but I need you to get that address to the police. Okay? Get them to listen to you. It's on you, you understand? - Yeah. - [PENNY] All right. You're a bitch, Dean. [PENNY] Just like your brother! Two ugly sons of a bitch! [PENNY] Which means your mother's a bitch too, I guess. [PENNY] That's logical, right? I was trying to draw him out. [SIREN WAILING] [TIRES SCREECHING] Okay. You're gonna go down that alley. You go as fast as you can, okay? Okay. On three. One, two, three. [PENNY] Go. [MACHINE GUN FIRE] [MAN GRUNTS] I'm coming for you, cop! [PANTING] This is a message for the police. The shooters are Max and Dean Keller. Their address is 1470 Prytania Street, and we think they have Claudia Volk there. They have Claudia Volk at 1470 Prytania Street. Let's roll out! [AVA] Clover, I've got to go back in, I've got to help them. That psycho left a morgue behind. You almost left in a body bag, Av. You know I don't do funerals or cemeteries, it's too dangerous. It is time to get out, girl. No, I'm good. [GROANS] [HORN HONKING] [GLASS SMASHING] [MACHINE GUN FIRE] [WATER DRIPPING] [DEAN] Come on out, cop! [DEAN] Let's get this over with. I don't want to kill you, Dean. I just want the girl. [DEAN] That's the rub, isn't it? You kill me, you kill the girl. I don't mind kneecapping you, though. You didn't kneecap my brother. Yeah, I had no choice. Just like you had no choice when you killed that kid? That's right, asshole. It's all over the Internet... TV even. We're famous, you and I. [GRUNTS] Penny! [DEAN] This is getting fun! [GRUNTS] [BOTH GRUNTING] [SIREN WAILING] - [DEAN GRUNTING] - [PENNY GROANS] [GRUNTING IN DISTANCE] - [METAL CLATTERING] - [GRUNTING IN DISTANCE] [GRUNTING] [METAL CLANKS] I think your girlfriend's here, Penny. [WHISTLES] - We're streaming live. - [DEAN] No shit. And I got to say I'm one handsome son of a bitch. I've got millions of witnesses. Don't do anything stupid. You think I'm afraid of a little facetime, huh? Pig number one, are you listening? That's you, Volk. You're the number one pig. In about half an hour, your little piglet's gonna be dead. And you're gonna know what it feels like... to lose someone close to you, to stand by while you watch your blood breathe their last breath alone in the dark. And there's not a goddamn thing you can do about it. [DEAN] Gimme that. Whatcha got here? [LAUGHS] It's like Call of Duty. [TENSE MUSIC BUILDING] It's funny, isn't it, reporter? Now that I got the camera, I don't need you anymore. [EXHALES SHARPLY] Please. Bye-Bye. [GRUNTS] [PENNY] Ava, move it. Come on. Here's an idea. Don't be the news. - [AVA] Look who's talking. - [PENNY] Come on! [BOTH PANTING] Okay, what now? There. Over there. [PENNY] You got to be kidding me. [AVA] Nope. Nope, nope, nope, all my nopes. [PENNY] All right, well, tell Dean when he gets here, I think his dad's a bitch, too. [DEAN] Penny! I'm ready for my close-up! Close your eyes and plug your nose. Come on. I'm hating today so hard right now! [DEAN] Penny! [MACHINE GUN FIRE] [AVA GRUNTS] [GROWLS] [BOTH GRUNTING] [PANTING] [PANTING] [PENNY GRUNTING] 1470 Prytania. - Huh? Come on! - [DEAN] If you know that address then you know what this is all about. [PENNY] She's there, isn't she? Claudia Volk. I told the cops. - [LAUGHS] - You hear that? The cops are on their way, you dirtbag. [SIREN WAILING] Go, go, go! [MAN] Bring it in! [MAN] Shit, it's a fake! He lied to us! No! Goddamn it! [LAUGHING] What? I take it back, pig. You don't know shit. Where is she? Ask them what it's like. No! No. No! Answer me! Answer me! Penny. Everything's gonna be okay. Claudia needs you to focus. [AVA] Okay? [MAN] Take that side! I'm in! On the north side! But now we need to go. [AVA] Okay? [SIRENS WAILING] [SIREN WAILING] [AVA] Where now? - 1470 Prytania. - But wait, - he said they weren't at that... - Rule number three, never believe dirtbags. [PENNY] No. I want a real car this time. [PENNY] Come on, go, go! [PENNY] Hey, stop! [TIRES SCREECH] Excuse me, innocent citizen. I'm an officer of the law. May I please have the use of this vehicle? A little girl's life is at stake. Bite me. [MAN] Hey! Get your hands off me. - [MAN GROANING] - He said please. [MAN] What the hell? - [ENGINE REVVING] - Let's do this. - [MAN] Asshole! - [AVA] This is what I love. This is what media feels like, actually doing something, finding the truth, not hiding behind your computer, waiting for some viral bullshit to land in your lap. This is why I do my job. You're starting to convince me. What? Media isn't all just a pack of ratings whores. Did you just compliment me? Don't get used to it. And this man right here, boys and girls, this is proof that there are dope-ass cops out there doing everything they can to protect you. Did you just compliment me? Yeah. Get used to it. [AVA] Clover, what you got for me? Prytania is a bum address. So, it says here two years ago, the building was leveled after the Kellers' meth lab in the basement exploded. What the... So, you're telling me we just risked our lives for nothing, that Claudia was never there? Yeah, pull over now, dig a ditch. No! Your bestie always comes through. I just got into the city's property record. Turns out the boys recently inherited the house that they grew up in. New address. [TIRES SCREECHING] Whoo! [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [EMT 1] He's patched up and ready. [EMT 2] Got him. [EMT 1] One, two, got it. [SIREN WAILING] [TENSE MUSIC PLAYING] [EMT 3] Loading 10ccs. [EMT 1] Let's get that line. It's ready. - [EMT 1] Prop up the bag. Ready? - [EMT 3] Get it prepped. [GUNSHOTS] - [EMT SCREAMING] - [MAN] Holy crap! [TIRES SCREECH] [TIRES SCREECH] [GRUNTS] [GASPING] [GROANS] Y'all brought out the big guns for me. I'm flattered. Every cop in this city's looking for you, asshole. Where the hell you gonna go? Home. - [GUNSHOT] - [CAR ENGINE REVVING] So, what's this about? Why would Dean and Max go to such great lengths to hurt a little girl? [PENNY] It's not about Claudia. They wanna hurt Volk. I don't know why, but this is very personal. [BEEPS] Twenty minutes. Hold on. We're almost there. [AVA] We're about to enter the last known address of the kidnappers. [AVA] I don't know what we're gonna find inside. [AVA] I'm gonna shut up. [BOTH PANTING] [LOCK BREAKS] [CLOVER SIGHS] Oh! Lovely. [CAT YOWLS] Smells like a giant kitty litter in here. [PENNY] All right, she's got to be here. So check every door, cabinet, closet. [PENNY] Look for a hose or a water source. - [CAT YOWLS] - I'm so not a cat person. Wait, stop! What is that? Is that a booby trap? [TENSE MUSIC BUILDING] [WIRE SCRAPING] That's creatively psycho. The Texas Chainsaw MacGyvers. Great. My ass, you don't watch TV. Touché. Hey. Be careful, all right? Copy that. [PANTING] Let's see what fresh hell we can find upstairs, shall we? - [STAIRS CREAKING] - [TENSE MUSIC PLAYING] [AVA] This looks like a younger version of Max and Dean Keller. Seems like we're in the right place. What is it that Penny said? That this seems personal. IT BEGS THE QUESTION: Who's the girl? Clover, are you listening? [AVA] Find out who that girl is. [TENSE MUSIC PLAYING] [CAT MEOWS] Good kitty. I will now like cats. [PENNY PANTING] Holy shit. Claudia! [BEEPING] - [COMPUTER CHIMES] - [AVA] Yo, Clover, What's up? That girl was the Keller's sister, Naomi. Claudia! Claudia, can you hear me? [GRUNTING] [CLOVER] When their meth lab blew up, she was trapped in the basement. The police didn't even go in for 64 minutes, typical. When they found her, she was already dead. She was drowned, there was a burst water pipe. Sixty-four minutes. [PENNY GRUNTING] And get this, the Officer in charge that night was Vice Captain Tom Volk. So this is their revenge. Thank, Clover. Good work. [PANTING] Oh. It's a trap. It's a trap! - Ava! - [BEEPS] [HEAVY BREATHING] Don't lift your foot. [AVA] Is that what I think it is? This wire heads down to all the gasoline in the basement. Gasoline? Yeah, you know the stuff they put in real cars. - We already had this talk. - Ha-ha. Ava, I need you to be real cool right now. I'm cool. Popsicle cool. All right, this is no jar of nails. This brings the whole building down. I'm cool. This is my cool face. Okay, I'm gonna trace this wire down, see if I can cut it before it blows our basketballs off, okay? [AVA PANTING] Penny? The Kellers had a sister, and she died. Yeah. I think I just saw her in the basement. And the Keller brothers blame Volk for not saving her. [SIREN WAILING] Bomb squad? Whoa! Ha! Ha! Okay. [SIREN FADING] [PANTING] [FIRE CRACKLING] [DEAN] What's up, cop? Not much, homie! Just admiring what you've done with the place. Ever consider selling? I'm considering... where I'm gonna shoot you first. I'm thinking your pecker. - Where's the girl, Keller? - [DEAN] No! Not until that timer hits zero! [PENNY] Goddamn it, Dean. Claudia's innocent, just like your sister was. She didn't deserve what happened to her, and Claudia doesn't deserve this. You wanna make a statement? Kill me, in front of the whole world, but not this little girl. What the hell's the point? [MACHINE GUN FIRE] The point? [DEAN] Funny thing about that. Sometimes a person dies, and nobody cares! Maybe they're just the wrong kind of person. Like my sister, Naomi. Somebody like that, cops just stand by and watch. I mean, she's just some white trash, some... meth head. Let her die. [DEAN] But one of your own, that's a whole different story, isn't it? I mean, I got cops willing to trade their lives for some kid they never even met. Ain't that a thing? Course, why trade... when you can get it for free? Ava, lift your foot! Let it blow up! [TENSE MUSIC PLAYING] [AVA PANTING] Oh, my God. [AVA] Come on. Come on! Come on! - [PENNY] Come on. - [AVA] Get up, come on. [PENNY] Let's go. [TENSE MUSIC BUILDING] [AVA COUGHING] We're in the attic, We're trying to find our way to the rooftop. [COUGHS] [BOTH PANTING] Somebody help us! Help! Someone needs to send us help now! That's our exclusive. Let's get our eye in the sky over there right now. [PENNY] No, listen to me. We jump, broken bones, maybe worse. - Up here, we're dead. - Okay. Okay. - [HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING] - [PILOT] I see you! I'm coming in! [PILOT] Stay where you are. We're gonna come to you. Hey! Hey! [PILOT] I'm gonna bring the chopper down. - [PENNY] Hey! Hey! - Hey! Hey! Hey, right here! [PILOT] I see you! I'm coming down. [PENNY] Hey! Right here! [PILOT] Stay on the roof. I'm gonna get as I can. That's it! That's it! That's it! Come on! Come on! [PILOT] It's gonna be all right. I got you. All right, get on. - Come on. Let's go. - [PILOT] Move! [AVA GRUNTING] [PENNY] Go, go, go! Get us in the air! Get us in... [SCREAMING] Penny! [AVA] Penny! [BOTH GRUNTING] Penny! [BOTH GRUNTING] [DEAN] Come on, bitch! Let's all die on TV! Oh, no! Ahh! Oh. Ava? Ava? [AVA] Get off me. [AVA] Hey! [GRUNTING] [AVA] Hey! [ALL GRUNTING] Whoo-hoo-hoo. [TENSE MUSIC PLAYING] Where's the girl? Six feet under, man! Enjoy the view! Are you okay? - What's the time? - Five or six minutes, tops. Damn it! Hey, look at me. - You did everything you could. - No. You did everything you could. No matter how many times someone tells you that, it doesn't make it true. I killed her. - [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] - [SOBBING] I killed her. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] I shot a kid. Nine years old, two years ago. His name was Robert. The father had a gun to the kid's head. He was high out of his mind. He was gonna pull a trigger. So I took the shot, just as the guy pulled the kid up like a shield. They said I did everything I could then, too. The little boy died. Now another kid's gonna be buried because of me. Hey. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Buried. Buried! He said she's six feet under! Enjoy the view! The view, Longview! - Longview! - They switched the caskets! - Sir, Longview! - [PENNY] Hey! Get us to Longview Cemetery now! You got it! [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [MAN] We're live in three, two, one. [NEWS REPORTER] In one of the most dramatic rescues ever captured on live television, our own eye in the sky rescued two people from the roof of that burning structure just moments before its roof collapsed. And there you have it. Channel 13's eye in the sky has rescued Officer Frank Penny and Reporter Ava Brooks. That's right, Jan, and stay with us for complete coverage on this gripping exclusive. [PHONE VIBRATES] Hey, It's me. - Oh, you're alive. - No time. We need to find Naomi Keller's grave. We think it's at Longview, but we need to know - the exact location. - Longview. On it. [MAN] All units, we have confirmation. They are heading to Longview Cemetery. [CAR ENGINE REVVING] [TIRES SCREECHING] [SIRENS WAILING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] Clover confirmed she's buried at Longview Cemetery, block nine, south lot. [PENNY] Get us on the ground! [MAYA] Hey, come on. The information we are receiving is that Longview Cemetery is their destination. [MAYA] Let's go. - Come on, let's go. - Let's go, man. Let's do this. Again, we have confirmed they are making their way to Longview Cemetery, and they need your help. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING] [PENNY] Let's split up. Block 9! Block 14! Block 13! Block nine. Ava, over here! I see it! Over here. - How much time? - [AVA] None. Claudia! [TENSE MUSIC PLAYING] Claudia! Penny. - [INDISTINCT CHATTER] - [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [MAN] Dig! Dig! [WOMAN] Right here! [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Somebody give me something to get this lid off! [PENNY] Give me room! Back off! Back off! Everybody back off! [CHEERING] You're okay. Daddy's here now. Daddy's here, here now. [CHEERING] You did it. We did it. Let's get outta here. [D] Yo, Steve Nash. - GOAT. - GOAT. [CHEERING CONTINUES] [CLOVER SHOUTING] Oh, I'm so proud of you. [BOTH LAUGHING] Come on, let's go home. Let's go home. Oh, look. - The real reporter showed up. - Ha-ha. Oh, look. The real cops. [LAUGHS] We should probably get out of here - before someone arrests us. - [AVA] Right, or puts us on TV. [AVA] You know, I'm still pissed about my car. It's not a car. Not funny. Still not funny. [PENNY] How about I make it up to you? How about a doughnut? Mmm, I'm hating today a little less right now. Me too. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [NEWS REPORTER] What an extraordinary scene here as a little girl is reunited with her father, and you saw it all unfold live.
