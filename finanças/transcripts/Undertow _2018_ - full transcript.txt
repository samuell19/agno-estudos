Hey, sexy! ♪ It's a fine, fine line between...♪ Come on, pick up, please. Dan, pick up. Please, Dan, please. No matter what you're thinking, let it out We can face the future with honest and open communication. So, Lisa, you told me before that you had something that you'd like to share. Yeah. It's our one year anniversary this week since we lost our little angel. We had his footprints and handprints moulded into plaster to, you know... Commemorate. ..commemorate. Yeah. Any pain there? No. How are you feeling in general, Claire? Good. I'm back at work, so that's been... And there? Mmm. A bit, yeah. Sorry, Claire. I'll send you in for a scan, see what's going on. No heaving lifting, and I'd caution against sex for the time being. OK. How are you and Dan going? It can put a big strain on a relationship. We're fine. Yeah, we're good. Good. Hello there, I'm sorry I can't take your call. But please leave a message and I'll get back to you. Dan, it's me again, I need to talk to you. Call me back. Hey, Bridget. Hey, Claire, I'm outside the courts. They're about to come out. Are you far off? Like, 10 minutes. Well it's going to be a good shot. You don't want to miss it. Yeah, I'm heading there now. OK, see you soon. Yep. Hey! Dan! Dan! Hey. It's me. I'm just... I'm sorry, my love, I can't talk right now. I'm at a fundraising meeting. Oh, right. Nothing urgent? No. Alright, well let's talk tonight then, yeah? Yeah. Alright, bye. Love ya. How was your meeting? Good. Fundraiser talk with Brett. Brett was there? Yeah. Keeping him on the straight and narrow. How long's that gonna last? Don't be such a fatalist. He's been off the rails since he stopped playing football. He's doing me a favour. People love him. He's an animal. That's your type, isn't it? What did you want to talk about? Nothing. I was driving out to a job. I thought I passed your car. It's a pretty common make. Not that? I'm not hurting you? No, no, no. Ah. What's wrong? Nothing. Nothing. I'm hurting you. You're not hurting me, Dan. I feel like I'm hurting you. Maybe it's too soon. No, no. Come on. The ultrasound showed up some adhesions, most likely from the D&C - the procedure after you delivered your baby. I'm afraid the damage is quite extensive. It will be much harder for you to conceive in the future. And if you do, you'll have a greater risk of complications. The prognosis is not good. I'm so sorry, Claire. ♪ Take me to the April sun in Cuba, oh-oh, oh ♪ Take me where the April sun gonna treat me so right What can I get for you, love? A glass of red, please. ♪ Take me to the April sun ♪ Come on, take me ♪ Take me to the April sun. ♪ I'm happy to get it this time. What do you want? Excuse me? You were watching me. Are you a talent scout? I'm just having a drink. Look, people like you don't drink here. People like that old sleazebag drink here. I've done some dancing and some acting. Some modelling, too. I'm not a talent scout. Well then what are you? Nothing. Nothing. A photographer. Wait. In case you change your mind. Dan. It's me. OK, um ... Look, no pressure. Just speak from the heart. Whatever's on your mind. It's much easier said than done, isn't it? We've got time. OK. It's like I never do anything without a spreadsheet. Love a good spreadsheet. Everything was planned out meticulously. And of course, I had made all these sorts of plans about the kind of Dad I was going to be. The night at the hospital, ah... I know that it was Claire that had to go through it physically, but fuckin' hell I just... Sorry, Darren. It's fine, Dan. What I'm trying to say is, I just... I had no idea it could feel like this. We didn't have a funeral. Claire didn't want one, so the hospital took care of it. Cremation. Claire. Would you like to share, too? Sorry? Have you thought about some kind of ritual? Sometimes it can be very healing. A kind of rebirth. Actually, we're having a water ceremony this weekend. Maybe you'd like to come and take a look? That sounds great. I don't think so. Sure. OK. Great. This place is cool, yeah? Like a cool background. Yeah, it's great. Over here? Sure. So what magazine's this going in? I mean, you do work for a magazine, yeah? I work for the paper. So what's this for? This is more personal. Like what? How old are you, Angie? 21. 19. How much would you pay me for a story? You've been watching too much TV. So you don't even want to know what it is? What are you doing at the motel? What motel? Are you in some sort of trouble? No. Jesus. No, wait. Wait! Can you keep a secret? Where are you going? Have you been smoking? What's going on, Claire? Why don't you tell me. Why don't I tell you what? I'm not stupid, Dan. I know about your little girlfriend. My little girlfriend? Would you stop repeating everything I say? I know about Angie. Angie? Jesus, you don't think that... Hang on, hang on. Just listen. Listen to me. Listen to me! She's Brett's girlfriend. Was Brett's girlfriend. He met her at a club... He met her at a club, started screwing, started a thing, and then he found out she was 16 and broke it off. 16? She didn't take it well. She says she's got nude photographs of him. Well, what's this got to do with you? He asked me to step in. I'm just trying to mediate before it blows out of all fucking proportion. Mediate. Jesus, just spare me the jargon, Dan. Why are you getting caught up in Brett's bullshit? I am not getting caught up. I saw you at a motel. Then Jesus, why didn't you just ask me? I did. Why didn't you just tell me? 'Cause she's pregnant. Does she want it? The baby? How should I know? Well you're mediating, aren't you? What's she going to do? Is she going to keep it? Brett asked me to talk to her, sort out some care. End of story.

Just tell them I want to talk to them before they make a rash decision. Yes, I get that. Yes! Well I don't know how it got out, but we can't let it affect the fundraiser. They're sponsoring the campaign, not Brett. Yes, yes I... Yes, I'm heading in now. Call a meeting. Fuck. What the hell happened to you? Oh, I gotta talk to you, Danny. Mate, can't you stay out of strife for two minutes? Bigger strife, mate. Fuckin' Jacko texted all the boys. Jesus. What the hell, Brett? Put that away. The stupid fuck thinks it's funny. Yeah, alright. So you punched him? Very constructive. What do I do? I mean, it all just fucking got out of hand. Mate, you need to pull your head in. My head's fuckin' in! How's your fuckin' head? Clean yourself up. Don't get any blood on the couch. What's going on? It's just Brett. He needs a place to crash. What's on the phone? Just come to bed. He'll get his act together in time for the fundraiser. Be good if we were OK, too. Present a united front. OK. This fundraiser is an important night for me. I need to know... It's fine, Dan. Look, there's no shame in admitting... I'm fine. Good. I've gotta go. OK. Sorry about last night. Can I get some water? It's a fuckin' shitstorm. I just want to be left alone, you know? How do you feel about being a father? Do I really look like father material to you? What about the girl? It's complicated, you know. What's complicated about it? Better ask Dan. Dan won't... You guys doing OK? You know, with the... We're fine. We're just getting on with things. You have to. I'll get out of your hair.

Did you know me and Brett have the same initials, only back to front? We had a fight that night. What about? He said I was flirting. Were you? Did anyone ever tell you that you're a nosy bitch?

I came to see Dan. Dan's not here. I've been calling you. Looking for you. You have to stop running away. We can't look after you if you keep running away. I don't want you to look after me. I'm afraid something is going to happen to you and the baby. Would you shut up about the baby? It's none of your business. It is my business, it's m... Give it back. Just give it...give it! Wait, wait. Shh-shh. I just want to talk to you. Fuck you. Hello, ladies. Welcome, welcome. It's great for everyone to be here. Hello. Hello there. Hello. Good to see you. I've been calling you all day. I couldn't get hold of you. What happened this afternoon? I'm sorry. I... No, I don't think you should be here. Brett, isn't it hypocritical to call yourself an ambassador for personal change? To position yourself as... Thank you, let's just concentrate on what this evening is really about, thank you. We at Kicking Goals are in the business of changing lives, but sometimes that change is not easy. In our daily work, we are met with challenges, and for those involved in our fantastic program they know only too well what those challenges are. But through our core values we know that those challenges... So, thank you so much for your support. It's going to be a fantastic year, so please give generously. In that small time, we've seen some really, really positive changes, and I think a program like Kicking Goals is a perfect fit for the Geelong health area. And you know, there's more to be done, as you know. And that's where your organisation can really, really help us out. You've had enough. Why don't I call you a cab and take you home? I don't want to go home. I need to talk to you. You're making a fool of yourself. Because you're treating me like one! Dan, you've got some trouble outside. Just wait here. ♪ I can not just face the beat... ♪ Respect! Easy, easy! RESPECT! RESPECT! Hang on, I'm fine, thank you. Yeah! Grab her. Grab her, grab her, grab her. Respect, hey? - Dan! - I'm fine! Give us a hand here. I deserve respect! She's in a bad way, I've got to get her out of here. - I'll come with you. - No, no, no, no, no. I'll be back soon. - Let me talk to her. Claire, you are pissed. Please don't make another scene. I just want to talk to you! Please, this is completely inappropriate! It's not what you think. The baby. I've seen... I promise you, it's not about us! Dan, please! Pass me off now! Claire, let's just get going. Come on. You want some of this?! Get her in a cab, make sure she gets home. Don't patronise me! Dan, just listen! - Brett! - Yeah, alright, alright. OK, I'm going! Catch you later, fuckheads! Haven't had a fucking drink all night. What the hell kind of stunt was that? If you want me to help you, this is not the way to go about it! Fine, let me out. No way. I'm taking you home. Gonna have a chat to your parents. My mum's boyfriend will beat the shit out of you. Angie... That night at the hotel... I drank too much. It was irresponsible. That's what I told Claire. What? How do you know Claire? Don't you know she's been stalking me and taking photos? I think she's in love with me. Angie! Turn here. Dan's a top bloke, you know. The best. He'd be a great father. What? I don't even know how to be a grown-up. I know that you think that I'm not great. A lot of girls want to fuck me. Good for you. I'm just saying. It's all part of the trip, you know? None of it is designed to make you want a girlfriend. It's all just good fun, you know? Until it's not. Angie? Angie?! Angie! Angie! That's enough now. Nothing? They gave me his stuff. Over here! They found his body. And Angie? Does she know? Get a bloody grip, Claire! Forget about Angie! I need to find her. Claire, listen. Claire! Scully, Mrs Scully! What is your relationship with Brett Anderson? Did Brett seem depressed? Claire, stop! No, no, look. There'll be a comment at a later stage. Right now, you just need to clear off. Claire? Claire. Claire, stop! Claire! Angie! So, that was you. On the news? Did you fuck him? Hmm? He'd fuck anything, you know. All I wanted was to look after you and the baby. God, there is no baby! You and the baby, that's all. There's no baby anymore! Please, Angie, I'm just trying to help. "Please, Angie, I'm just trying to help." I'm sorry. Brett invited me to his party and then he let his friends have sex with me, and then he dumped me like I was some random slut. And they all stood around laughing and filming it. Are you happy now?! Angie. Angie. - Just leave me alone. - You can't... JUST LEAVE ME ALONE! ANGIE! Come on! She's sleeping. She's lost a lot of blood but she's going to be OK. What about the baby? I'm sorry, I'm afraid she lost the pregnancy. It seems she's taken some abortion medication. I'm sorry. Where have you been? Where have I been? I found Angie. She's at the hospital. She lost the baby. Come away from the window. God, if you hadn't cared so much about what people think you might have stood up and taken some responsibility. You fucked my best mate and you're accusing me of being irresponsible? She's a child! How could you know about this and do nothing? Know about what? You were there at that party. How could you let that happen? Jesus, Claire, you don't think that I did... I've never seen this before! They were wasted! Everyone was wasted! They were in another room! I've... I didn't want to know.
