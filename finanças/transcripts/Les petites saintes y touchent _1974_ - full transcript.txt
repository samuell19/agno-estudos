YOUNG GIRLS IN ECSTASY My very dear girls, I want to express my joy at seeing you all gathered around me in this house dedicated to the worship of our Patroness Saint Joan of Arc. This year, once again, you wanted to get together to remember the happy time of your teenage years, when you became conscious of your life goal, and you built your destiny. I did everything I could to guide you and to allow your various personalities to blossom. I tried to give you all the spiritual support that you needed, and I'm proud to see that I succeeded in my task, because just like our great Saint, your lives all seem to be aiming at the same goal : the total blossoming of your senses, guided by your heart and your soul, which will keep you from consuming yourself vainly. Oh, sorry, little Saint, that's not exactly what I meant! I forgive you. Talking nonsense happens to everybody. I will conclude by sending to you and our beautiful house my eternal wishes of earthly happiness. Bravo! My children, cheers! Cheers! How is London doing ? Like the pelican exhausted by a long trip in the evening fogs. - You know London ? - Yes, I've already been there. What did you think of it ? Rather handsome. You know, I was leaving the boardinghouse where I lived when... Yes, how do you know ? First, you jaywalk. Second, you have a guide. Oh, precisely, and I don't want a second one. You can't do without me. I'll show you whatever you want. A carriage. Here is it. Yes. Is it that obvious ? No, don't worry, we'll fix that. First, a mini skirt, so you don't stand out anymore. But everyone will see my panties. No, nobody will see them. Just take them off. Besides, girls don't wear panties here. Ah, even with a miniskirt, a French girl will always have a crinoline in her head. - Oh, I don't dare. - Yes, go in. Here ? You are conditioned by a catholic-judeo-conservative heredity which fundamentals are established on the basis of humility, prejudices and traditions. Traditions, my ass! I'm sorry ? I said traditions, my ass. I might have judged you a little hastily. But you don't look very English. The English blood was reinvigorated by far away conquests. My father conceived me during a tiger hunt with a beautiful indigenous, while the tiger was too long in coming. And the tiger didn't spoil the festive spirit ? It actually did. But my father was the kind of man able to do many things at once. Like you! Yes, a little. And he killed it, involving it in his pleasure. - Very moving. - Yes. And it's on his hide I will procreate in turn. - You want a baby tiger ? -Yes! Do you think it will fit me ? No. It's too large. - No, no. - Oh, yes. - I don't think so. - Yes! I don't think so! Not bad. Oh, Churchill! - Where are we going ? - To a party at a friend's place. And you, you'll go to the hotel. What about us, didn't we meet somewhere ? What about going home ? You're driving me home ? That's not exactly what I meant. I like dim light. No, keep your skirt. I find it a lot more exciting. Turn around. Oh no! Not like that. Girls prefer that to the pill. Oh Mike, oh no! No, Mike! No, no, oh Mike! Oh yes... You see, now, you're a real little English girl. I'm a real English girl ? Yes. And it's a real English telling you that. It's me! No, stay as you are, it's Marc, he might want you. And in England we share everything. Hello! - What's the matter ? - You need to call your parents. They want you to come back immediately to Paris to revise for your bac. What ! You're not English ? Of course no, we live in Passy. A French! And we never went back to London. Well, I never visited London either. Even if we promised to do it with my fiancé if he won the slightly crazy challenge to cross the channel by swimming. And he stacked all the odds in his favor. Small Béarnaise crust, pike with a villageoise sauce, forestiére dish, lobster a I'Armoricaine... Two steaks, two yogurts and a bottle of Evian water. Can you imagine that some people eat spicy, aphrodisiac dishes, served with alcohol blurring their brain and their senses, and leading them to insatiable love making ? Can you imagine that ? Oh yes! What about going at your place tonight ? Are you crazy ? And my training ? And that is how I spent all my days of freedom at the swimming pool. Relentlessly, Bernard swam in the pool for endless solitary olympiads. And me, on the poolside, like a empty-handed fisherman, I flipped through huge books. I love you a little, just a little bit, a lot, much less, madly, not madly, and maybe one day not at all. And I became aware of what was called roman-fleuves. We had arrived the day before at a lovely port on the north part of the Manche department. It was the first time we spent a night under the same roof. And you can imagine my emotion, sharing a room with Bernard. But that emotion didn't last long, as Bernard, intransigent, had thought of everything. Did you sleep well ? Not really, and you ? Like a log. And I feel in great shape. You thought about me ? Of course ! I wondered if you got everything ready. Of course, I got everything ready. The grease. Here is it. Maybe it's time to go. Well, alright. The rope. Don't forget. When I pull once, you give me coffee. Twice, a sandwich. - And three times ? - It's an SOS. Bravo ! Bravo! Have a nice crossing. I hope you can swim! Shut up! Say hi to the English. Bring us some porridge back. Yeah, sure... Be careful, you'll fall. You'll wash later. It's not too cold ? Watch out for crabs. Thank you. Well, go ahead, what are you waiting for ? It's not hot! - Stay strong ! - Thank you. Well, let's go. To the water! Well done! Faster! Show me your breasts. Pull up your sweater. Pull up your sweater. Take it off. Now, your blue jeans. Come. I can't. You, come. Tie it to the edge. Kiss me. The rope! Too late, my poor Bernard had left us. Our fate is hanging by a thread. Like Ariane's. I too had to use many tricks to get what I wanted with the one I desired. - He didn't want you ? - Idiot! He had been put on probation. - He had committed an of fence ? - Yes! Which one ? The one of having been raised by a controlling and insanely jealous mother. How did you meet him ? By giving him English lessons at home. - And she wasn't supicious of you ? - Of course yes. But since she refused to send him to England, it was not the worst thing. Sit down. I wasn't expecting you to be that young. I have all my degrees. I'm sure you do, but I would have prefered an older teacher for my son. I always refused to send him to your country where you seem to have such dissolute customs. I can assure you that you're wrong. Anyway, you seem serious, let's have a try. Robert ? - Mom ? - Come here, honey. This is Miss Jane, your English teacher. With her, I hope you'll catch up. Nice to meet you, Miss. Hello, Robert. You can start now, the room is not very big, but you will be very very quiet. Read this text, so I can hear your accent. Look at me very carefully. Oh, yes! Your lips forward, your tongue touching your palate, or you will never manage to do it. This child has an awful accent, he'll never manage to pronounce the aspirated « h ♪. It's very difficult but we'll do it. Ah, in this case, you'll have all my gratitude. I didn't sleep all night. Do you love me ? - Hush... - Do you love me ? Kiss me. Later. Now. Better than that. What are you doing ? Still his accent, I was showing him how to put his lips. Were you ? But I want to hear you, don't slow down your work. Read, or she'll come back. Jane, I want to touch you so much. Can't you do two things in the same time ? Read, I told you. Watch out, go on. Aspirated, be careful with the aspirated « h ♪. Robert! Focus on your accent! Do as Miss Jane says, watch out, I'm listening! You mom is right, focus on the aspirated « h ♪. Start again here, careful with the aspirated « h ♪. Ah, you see, you can do it when you want to! There is no « Ah ♪, you'll do everything we want. And he did everything I wanted. Well, me, when I arrived in Paris with my fiance, he didn't do what I wanted at all. Having lived in Paris when he was a Beaux Arts student, my fiancé couldn't wait to make me visit the neighborhood he liked so much. On the bridge, a man walked by and watched us with so much intensity I instinctively turned to watch him. He had done the same. Tom didn't seem to have noticed and I was glad because he had a jealous nature. We are good here. Excuse me. Do you have any cigarettes ? Well, let's go. - You don't like this place ? - I do, but I want to walk. But it's all we've been doing since this morning. Well, let's not stop there. - You have a record to break ? - I don't like strolling. Paris gives itself only to those who knows how to savor it. Well, me, I want to devour it. But you'll be exhausted tonight if we want to go out. You see you're exhausted! - You're not from here ? - Indeed. And it's your first time in Paris ? No, I know the city well because I studied here, and I'm acting as a tour guide for my fiancee, Chantal. Allow me to introduce myself, Chris top he. And I'm Tom. Will you have a drink with us ? With pleasure. Thank you. To our meeting and maybe our friendship. Don't you like dancing ? Chantal loves that, but I don't dance. - Can I ? - Of course. Let's sit down, now. Your fiancée is a very good dancer. You should take lessons. You are an adorable couple. Let's go home, I'm tired. Tired ? But what did you do today ? You're not going to bed now, are you ? You will have the rest of your life to recover from this trip in Paris. Come on. Come, I invite you to my place for one last drink. Right ? Chantal, you're like a piece of art whose mere presence creates the perfect atmosphere for exchanging. Don't smile. You seduced me and I'm not ashamed to admit it to your fiance, because I feel closer to him that way. What do you mean ? When two men are attracted to the same woman, they have many other things in common. Maybe that's why they usually hate each other. Don't think that. Many of the women who find their balance only with two men have only one desire : make them meet. And, unlike what you think, they always make an ideal couple. - You mean a trio. - If you want. Tom, reassure her because, in our case, it's purely intellectual. I'm sure it is. - Tom, let's go please. - Why ? We're good here. - This man disturbs me. - He's not disturbing at all. - He followed us all day long. - What do you say ? He was behind us in every street. - And at the café, he was behind me ? - Exactly. You're imagining things, darling. We are sleepwalkers, walking on the edge of a roof, and it's dangerous to wake us up. Well, to our dreams! To you, dear Tom. To our paths. To the fixed fates that allowed them to meet and to leave each other for our greatest joy. May I ? Your self-control hides a passionate and original soul, I'm certain. Why do you say that ? I feel us so close to each other, and I would like to be your confident, like a big brother. Look, Chantal fell asleep. Her dreams took her away from us. It's time to leave. Happy encounteers are so rare, if you agree, I'll carry her to my couch and, while she sleeps, we'll keep on chatting. Understood. And you didn't feel a little lonely ? Oh, yes, a little! With or without us, boys always unwind with foreigners. They are vulnerable, and often don't understand the language, which is not always true but it's funny to let them believe that. This is Pamela. A young English woman visiting Paris. Where did you find this beautiful stranger ? Under the Arch of Triumph, as usual. She doesn't speak French ? Yes, I'm giving her lessons. Pamela, what is... ca ? My ass! That's all she learned ? Well, that's enough to have a nice carrier. By the way, where are your girls ? Well, the truth is... That you're going to watch me fuck. Oh, we still have the whole trip to find some. Who said we didn't find anything ? Better than that ? With a better body, yes. Look... Look at those shapes! Well done. Well, let's go, let's hit the road. And the car ? Jimmy's watching it. What do we take ? A salami. Yes. And with that, sir ? A saucisson. Angelo... Come on, let's go. Come on, let's go, they're waiting for us. Thank you very much. Goodbye, Sir. - Who's next ? - Me. Excuse-me. Yes, very good. And... what can I take ? - A turkey ? - Yes, please. Well, that's a nice house. - It's a little too late. - What is a little late ? Every weekend we have so many girls we don't know what to do with them, and when your parents give us the house, forget it. - Forget what ? Well... Nothing. Not a single girl. Not a single girl ? And what is that ? That's not bad... Not bad at all. Looks like she's hot-blooded. Hot blood or not, I'd need a box of twelve just to put me in the mood. Come on, stop messing aroung. Let's eat. Here, catch. I'm going to tell you a story, now. A couple, husband and wife, the wife is pregnant. The husband drives her to the clinic and waits in the hall. The wife is in the room, when suddenly a nurse goes out. The husband looks at the nurse, he says : « He was born? ♪. The nurse says : « Yes, yes, he was born ! ♪. The husband : Is it a woman ? ♪. The nurse says : « It's a boy ♪. « A boy, oh, at least, he was born, he was born, I have a son ! ♪ The nurse says : « But... he's missing an arm ♪. The poor father, filled with emotion : « He's missing an arm! « What am I going to do ? He's my son! « I'll give him one of my arms when he's grown up ♪. The nurse : « you know he's missing the other arm, too ♪. « That doesn't matter, he's my son ! ♪. The nurse : « But he's also missing a leg ♪. The father : « Also a leg ? That's not possible, no ♪, « That's not possible, no ♪, desperate : « But I want to see my son ! ♪. So the nurse goes in the room, brings outside a baby with an ear as big as that. The father : « My son, my son ! ♪. The nurse : « speak louder, because he's deaf ♪. Are you sure she fucks ? Of course, all the English women take the pill. Well, that's good then. You are well placed. So, we'll satisfy her. She seems to have an amazing pair of breast. Wow! Well... That's not bad. Not bad! Have you seen her thighs ? You won't get bored. They are firm. She has a thin waist and a wonderful ass. Bastard, it's turning me on. Leave her alone, I'm the one who found her. Later, if there's still some left. The box of cigars is on the mantelplace. It's your turn. But I warn you, I exhausted her. Patiently, I waited for the rest of the program for, lucky for me, it was a relay race. Unfortunately, I soon realized they too were sprinters. Once again, my patience was severly tested, and I counted a lot on alcohol as a boost. And I noticed that if alcohol helps women, it tires men out, if may say so. And the wrestle stopped for lack of wrestlers. At least, those two, when they're tired, you just need to change the batteries. I find you very frivolous. Why ? No matter how good are the partners in bed, only true love matters. You're right. You won't find it having affairs. It comes without warning, when you expect it least. Indeed. My parents had decided to send me in England to improve my knowledge. The family in which you'll be au pair is a very respectable family. Mr and Mrs Grey won't ask you to perform difficult tasks, only some small favors you'll have to do with good cheer. You won't feel disoriented at any time, because even at the airport their driver will wait for you. But fate had other plans. And, of course, my driver will be at the airport. I hope to have a better weekend than the last one. The girl, who had no erotic imagination, refused to yield to my wishes. I never discuss the price, but I want high quality girls. Ah... well. Oh. Come in, come in, please. Hello. Did you have a safe trip ? Yes, thanks. You have a very nice house. Does it inspire you for your studies ? My studies ? I don't have much left to learn. That's what we think, but we always have small gaps. - You think ? - Of course. Since that's also the reason you came here. You think ? Please make yourself comfortable. Right now ? Do you want a cup of tea ? With pleasure. Very good. Please forgive me for not imitating you, I'd rather have... a cognac. A French cognac. What are you doing ? You told me to make myself comfortable. But I only meant your sweater! You're not in your bedroom! Excuse me, my French is very bad. This is our pretty lodger. Good afternoon. Oh, I'm silly, I didn't introduce you to my wife. Your wife ? Yes, you'll see her later. The French are never serious in business. I have to admit you don't correspond at all with what I asked. But... you are charming. And I think it will be fine. I'll do my best not to disappoint you. My parents strongly recommended it to me. You parents ? Yes, of course. Well... The French are more modern that I thought. It reconciles me with them. Can I wear a miniskirt and socks ? It's more pleasant at home. Socks ? What a good idea. This is what I call imagination. I'm sorry, Sir, please, about money, my parents told me you would give me some upon my arrival. Money before... Right. It is the custom. You know, it's just to buy me some candies. She's a real food lover. Do you know, Miss, what we expect from you ? Oh, I do, don't worry. I don't intend to take advantage of you. I'll just ask you some practical services. I'll be very practical, don't worry. And... will it take place in my bedroom ? In your bedroom, and a little everywhere in the house, too. Ah. What a temper! Temper ? Oh, temperature! Very cold. You'll have to wear warm clothes here. You see what I mean ? Oh, perfectly. And... what time will be the first... small service ? Tam, tomorrow morning. You're a morning person. Very good, I'll be there on time. Do you want a glass of cherry brandy ? No thank you. What about you ? A little more vodka. You're so helpful. Yes, my parents recommended it to me. Be nice, don't always speak about your parents, it makes me very uncomfortable. Why ? My father looks a lot like you. I'm flattered. I won't do it anymore if it bothers you. Come close to me. You look like those Christmas dolls. Standing straight in their cardboard box. As soon as children put their hands on them, they have only one thing in mind : pull up their skirt to see their panties. Sit on my lap. Little French doll. You are made of porcelain, very soft, and very thin. A little cold, maybe, but certainly so pleasant to warm you up. The designer who drew the shape of your eyes, the oval of your face and the contours of your lips was very talented. Is it the same with your breasts ? Yes. With the touch of his brush, he shaded them perfectly. Can I go in my bedroom ? Of course, impulsive little doll, the bedroom is at the end of the hall. I'll meet you there. But who are you ? Gwed Junior. But they call me Bobby. I didn't want to wait 7am to see you. Because it's you I have to see at 7am ? Yes. This will be our first official meeting. But since I'm very shy, I wanted to have a first small private meeting before. So they made me come for you ? Of course. They didn't tell you ? No. But that doesn't matter. You're here to teach me. But you'll see, I'm already pretty good. You'll have to improve me. Improve you ? Yes, the small French specialities. Can I say that ? Yes, you can. We say that. Then... See you tomorrow. See you tomorrow, Miss. And good night. Good night, Junior. How nice. You're the first one to be so considerate. - My parents... - Ah, please. Oh, sorry. This time, you deserved to be spanked. Come. But my father never dared. Here, please. A smack, on your pretty little porcelain bottom. There, there, there. You're very disconcerting, but I think we'll get along very well. Where is the bathroom ? It's this door. I come to give a bath to my little doll. No, I can do it on my own. Oh, a little modesty won't bother me. The warm water has warmed my little doll up. Let me do. I'll wash you everywhere. You're so smooth. You're so flexible. You're so warm. Come. No. My parents... No, no! My parents... No! Stop struggling now. It was fun in the beginning, but now it bothers me. - Let me do. - I'm a virgin. - You're a virgin ? - I'm virgin. - Say it again, it turns me on. - I'm virgin! Come in. Well, it's 7:30am, and you're not punctual. But I've been ready since 7am. But that's not where it takes place. That's what I thought. But, but, but it's always downstairs in the morning. Really ? Come quick, my wife is very impatient, she's very excited. Ah, your wife will be there too ? Of course. My wife and my children too, what do you think ? In England, that's what we do. In the morning, the whole family gathers. We always do everything together. I start understanding why you drive on the left in England. But it has nothing to do with it. Oh, no, of course. Oh, the French mind. Hello, my little darlings. Who's first ? I think there's only one way to make it up to you. It's by marrying you. But what will my parents say ? Our daughter, Mrs Smith, the duchess of Kensey. And that's how I had the honor to become a duchess. Wonderful. Duchess or not, it's always ours to honor men. I'll never fall into their trap. When I went out, I was lucky to meet a leader of the MLF, a real amazon who taught me that our relationships with men must be limited to procreation. - Two foreigners. - This is for us! What are you doing here ? We are part of the international MLD and we fight for gender equality. We'd just like to chat with you. Intellectuals! I told Denis : « With them, we won't waste our time in idle chatter ♪. Alright. In this case, we accept. You will enrich us. We are building a universe to come where woman will be so much superior to man that his role will be limited to fertilization. Like the bumblebee in the hive. It's quite simple : back to the origins. We are very happy to have met boys who understand us without laughing at us. Who don't limit their exchanges with women only to sex. Is pleasure really important ? The friction of two skins. Nothing more. Regarding us, it's our spirits that rubbed against each other. And what sparks! We go to my place ? What for ? To carry on with those fascinating talks. - The four of us, then. - Of course. What do you think. Have a seat, please. May I ? Thank you. Oh, this is beautiful. This too. Sorry. It's nice. It's not unhealthy here. Some alcohol ? We have nothing against alcohol, as it allows intellectual exchanges. Whereas usually, we use it to degrade women and make them helpless. Oh yes. What I like in you is your personality, your stubbornness. And we can feel nobody can influence you in any way. Come, I'll show you the house. You'll see it contains no trap to disturb or seduce you. On the opposite, it's made to create the perfect atmosphere for exchanging ideas. You see, nothing will happen to you. Does it reassure you ? Not at all, they never do anything for us. Understand why we can't stand any male dishonorable behavior. Men only see in us objects to be used for their bestial needs. And that's why they reduced us to slavery. Our motto is a sound mind in a sound body. Ah, you are athletes ? We even already broke some records. In what discipline ? It depends on the partners. You are good at everything. What a shame today there's a barrier between man and woman, wife and husband. That is why many marriages that seem harmonious actually hide the most intense difference of opinions, of feelings. Oh, yes, I like that. Please, children, let's be serious. Let's get our feet back on the ground, if we want to deserve heaven one day. Even if it's not that much fun up there. Mother, thank you for allowing for the first time a journalist to enter this place dedicated to contemplation and meditation. In the hustle and bustle and the madness of our modern lives, we can't imagine that beautiful young women leave this world forever, and this because of a mystical vocation. Time doesn't mean anything for them anymore, they already live in eternity. How is that possible ? Thanks to the richness of their inner life. Having not lived, they possess all the human experiences, because God lives in them, body and soul. Such serenity, and how we must envy them. Of course, when you never come out of your hole, you tend to remain a virgin.
