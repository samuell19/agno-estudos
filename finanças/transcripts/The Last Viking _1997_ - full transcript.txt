THE LAST VIKING He who has a ship, can do what he wants. The ship sets him free. Losing his ship condems him to thraidom. When the king tried to impound all ships for his army, chieftains came from far and wide to reason with him. They waited at the gate for days, but the king refused to see them. You are his brother. He will listen to you. Rumour had it that the king suffered from a strange disease. That his eyes had become bulging and black, his skin mottled. One even claimed that two horns had grown out of his forehead. No man shall mock the fearsome power of the king. Your warriors slay are foes of old Our proud men carrying gold... But the song died down and fear turned to terror, when the king's brother was taken away. Then the king appeared. Doubt does not go with honour. Cowards do not follow a bold man. Any more doubting cowards who wish to see the king? Long live the king! No one defies the king. That is the law. Even if the king is lawless, and his power has gone too far. When his soldiers rode off to impound ships, they spread his madness across every single village. Shh, Bjarke! I'm the chieftain. No, we both are. We're at King Grimnir's fortress, to take back all he has taken from us. Then we're going to capture him. Shhh! Dad mustn't hear us! What? Is anybody in there? No, there can't be. Because Harald and Bjarke know not to play in the weapon store. - Bjarke! - Harald! - I've told you before! - It was Bjarke's idea, too. You're in charge of him. Right? And find another game instead of war. Death to the king! - Pick them up! - Pick them up yourself. - Don't do her chores for her. - Bjarke loves Eisa! Look! It's the king in disguise! The king must die! - The king must die! - Pardon? - The king must die... - Which king? King Grimnir usually nails people like you to his gates. - Not much room there, I bet. - Enough for you. We were only playing. Kids need to understand orders, and obey them. I know that game well. Better, much better. You've captured a great warrior? - Have you packed? - My thralls will pack for me. - Dad! - Who's he? - A man who says G... - I am Sigbard Fathir. Don't interrupt my son. Go down and eat and drink. - I will... - Then I will listen. - I haven't time. - None of us has time. - You have travelled far. - All right. I'll eat first and then give you your orders. Men like him should be left to wait. He has a lovely steed. Eh, Bjarke? His type rides dead men's steeds. All he owns belonged to another. I told you to fetch firewood. You are a dullard with no pride in your work. - I've had enough. - Someone pushed her. All her sticks fell into the gorge. What are you waiting for? No work to do? Never speak up for a thrall in their hearing. Never. - Who owns that steed? - A king's man. - What does he want? - Nothing good. He has killed men for their steeds, weapons and clothes. - Why tell him such things? - The truth is good for him. Pay no attention to your father. ...Let me talk to him. - You'll lose your temper. - Never. More taxes, more silver, more corn, more horses are what he wants. Up north they want to rebel, and we must choose sides. No, Bjarke. You mustn't die. The king must die. Easy, easy. Mum and Dad need us. You must live. Look at this. Gunga! Bring back my mead! Stand still when I'm talking to you! Gunga! I'll... Gunga! Curse you! Him and his mead! He could have killed me. After all I've done. - How much has he drunk? - Two casks, maybe three. Open up! Gunga, did you tell on me? I'll kill the lot of you. Skralling, open up! Skralling... I've had enough. We don't want a drunken old goat along with us. Gunga can't even tell fore from aft. What does Gunga know of ship building? Not a jot. - What am I to do with you? - Good question. Thrash you every day like my father did, when you were a master shipbuilder? What have you built since I freed you? He can't build boats. Not even my son has seen you build anything. No, Gunga! You little devil! Shout and holler, that's all you can do. I'll rip your tongue out. If you kill Gunga, who'll tend to you? Drinking. That's my freedom. Where's yours? You talk uprisings, but you trade with Grimnir as you lick his backside. How does it feel? We're sailing to trade for winter. There'll be no sailing. This ship is for the king. Grimnir has received silver, corn, horses and thralls. - Is he to take our ship, too? - Let's not be selfish. Grimnir sees farther than you or I. We must all make sacrifices. It is my ship. I say who she shall serve. I don't like you, and I don't like waiting. The ship is the king's. Gently does it... - Let's talk. - Talk? Get out. Get out! Thanks a bunch. I was about to take him. - So I saw. - Get out! He's alive. Tie him up. Keep an eye on him. A whole mead bag! You devil! A whole bag. I'll... If we release him, the king's soldiers will be here in a week. Then we won't just lose a ship. The king didn't spare his own brother. Right. If we keep Sigbard, we have a month to get help from the rebels. At the most. If we let him have the ship, won't he let us have something in return? Yes. He will let us starve. If we give Grimnir the ship, all we have left is our lives. Will we fight for Grimnir? Or for right to live as free men? That is what this is about! Agne! No man wastes mead and goes unpunished. Understand? Down you go. Skralling! Skralling! You were only meant to watch him. You can't be trusted to do anything. What if he'd escaped? Do you realise what would have happened? Fish are fish, and even rotten fish belong in the sea. Where do you belong, then? At the bottom of a mead barrel. It's a sign of good luck. Let's set sail! You had better stay at home, where it's safe. I want to come with you. I want to come. Show me your hand. Lift me. - Strength isn't all that counts. - Come on. - I just don't want to. - It's every man for himself. Axes and swords treat old warriors and green boys alike. - I am a warrior! - Take this. I know you will obey me. I need you here. To protect your mother, and Bjarke and the village. We're ready. I'll miss you, lad. Oh, you killed that mosquito. - We'll say goodbye on board. - You'll be sorry you left me! - Bird... - No, it's a frog. - Father... - No, I am your father. You'll conquer the world and forget all about us. - I'd never go if I thought... - Thought what? That we'd lose one another. Grimnir is no god. He isn't. I'll be back soon. We'll cope. He'll get over it. - The ship has gone. - One ship more or less... Tell Grimnir that. Take half the men and spread out. Mother! Mother! Mother, Bjarke! No! Mother! I am Thorgrim Lodur, the king's envoy. I have come... to make sure everyone pays the king what he owes. I am Frej Vanirsdotter. We owe the king nothing. Our menfolk sailed weeks ago. Your husband was ordered to give his ship to the king. If he had received the order, the king would have had his ship. Such lies do not become you. Proud of your husband now? What he did to Sigbard, he did to me. And the king. Where has he gone? Eketorp? To plot with Konur? I am not burdened with such things. How sad. It might have saved your life. So he's fled, and left you to drown. We're not dead yet. We can build a ship ourselves. We have the best shipbuilder. Build a ship for the king. The fleetest you've ever built. For Grimnir? - Never! - Lets us not debate. Build. Or die. Have you ever felt fire? Scared? - Now we'll play "obeying orders". - No! I don't want to! Bjarke! Let me go! No! In his head he is a child. Do what you please. But do you want a child's blood on your hands? Sharp tongues like hers can cut you. Lock him up. We don't kill idiots. Does it taste nice? Just wait till my father returns! Come, Harald... Come on, Harald. Go away, you filthy thrall. Calm down, Bjarke. I am here. Don't cry. Father will return soon. Soon, Bjarke. Bjarke will be let out again. There, there... Skralling must build them a ship. He hasn't built one for twelve years. You must watch over him, and in the boathouse you'll be safe. Make it look as if he is busy. - Where will you be? - Staying alive. Until father comes home. Trust me. Harald, can I trust you? You can. You were the one who tried to drown the king's man. Where will you go? I drowned no man. I did nothing wrong. I can't build a ship. I can't. Let us go. You are staying here. That's an order. You don't give me orders. - You threw him into the fjord. - I threw nobody. - My father gave you your freedom. - Where is he now? Here to defend me? I can't see him anywhere. Can you? Agne? Maybe he was right. The whole village mocks you. But my father said you were the best. - Did he? - Yes, and now you show everyone. - That it's true. - He had no idea. It's not that simple. You see the ship. In the night. You dream her and then you must tempt her out of the darkness. You're afraid. Afraid you can't do it. Isn't your arm getting tired? Come on. He is always afraid before he gets started. You don't know what you are talking about. That's the difference between you and me. I want a drink. I am thirsty. Did I really throw him into the fjord? This is good. We won't find anything better. But it isn't my tree. It is the best tree in the forest. - After all, the ship is for Grimnir. - Grimnir? Who the hell is he? We're building a ship. That takes timber. There's no timber here. We'll try that one. What about that one? Get to work! Pull! - I am pulling. - In the other direction! Pull! No! Help! I'm going to tickle you... You love it, don't you? Tickle, tickle! Rubbish. Rubbish. - It's a good tree. - Forget it. It is a good tree. Look out! Say you're sorry. I told you not to chop till I said so. - I'm sorry. - Fetch some wedges. My fault. It's a fine tree. A fine tree. Just right for the keel. Perfect. That'll do. Come and eat! I'm not hungry. We must finish the ship. How are you going to use an axe tomorrow? - He's done two days' work today. - He's two days behind. I need a drink. Or must I die of thirst? You're not doing anything. You just laze around. I'm using this. The ship is for King Grimnir. It needn't be the best. Grimnir! A ship is a ship. I have chopped enough planks to fill ten boat houses. A ship is no better than her smallest part. If a part is too thick, or another too thin, all is lost. Gunga! The axe! In the bucket behind the nails. Gunga, the last ship we built... Wasn't the keel higher at the front? - Yes, and she didn't sail well. - No, but it wasn't the keel. I think the first tree we saw was better. Sigbard! Take charge while I go to see Grimnir. - Keep them at it. I want no trouble. - Greet the king for me. Is anything the matter? - Stay here! - That was Bjarke. Let go of me. Your mother is up there. Help me! Come on, help me! You're the best warrior I have. - Who's pushing me? - I have Thorgrim's word. No harm shall befall my sons. Get your hands off him! Release my mother. - There's a real man. - Bjarke is innocent. I burned you. Keep it steady. Look me in the eye. Tell Sigbard where your father has fled. - He flees from no man. - No, it runs in the family. - Don't let your hand shake. - Go, Harald! A shame Thorgrim isn't here for your mother, the way she likes. - Liar! - Your mother's the liar. - One more step and I shoot. - Shoot. Too late. My turn. Remove that whore. Let her go. Cut the boy down. We were only playing. Clear up. Get them out! - Don't turn on your own men. - I didn't ask for your opinion. You stubborn twit! You've been hiding mead? I can't sleep either. - We'll lay him by the fire. - No, better with you. - We must go on building. - Don't talk about that now. - Grimnir's men are far too strong. - You talk too much. That's idle chatter. I'll tell you a story. Once your father and I were at sea. We had taken much silver and we had set sail. We discovered that Gunga was missing. He's so small you lose sight of him. We thought the enemy had captured him. Know what your father did? He turned the ship round, went back, and stepped ashore. He smote the enemy right and left, so they fell like ripe fruit from the tree. His sword sang. Then he found Gunga, picked him up, and leaped back to the ship. Gunga... - He's asleep! - Sit still, then. Give me the cup. Come on. I should have killed you all immediately. - You shouldn't have spared me. - I want you alive. You know I will do anything to save my children. We don't need anyone else. - I can't live without my children. - You won't have to. I can't live without you either. You don't know it's like having a father. You never had one. Of course I had a mother and father. I just can't remember them. My first memory is of a long journey on your father's ship. - I've been a thrall ever since. - No other memories at all? Fire. And somebody screaming. Bjarke! Soup! Bjarke? Bjarke, wake up. I've brought soup. No, Bjarke, you must eat it, not blow it in my face. Bjarke! Eat it! If you eat, I'll tell you about the ship we're building. A ship isn't just built, she is dreamed. Father once saved Gunga's life. He carried him away from a gang of angry warriors... They've come back! - They're in the forest. Shoot! - It's only a shadow. Shoot! Into the forest! Come. Svarre? It is not good, Harald. Let me see how strong you have grown. That arrow must come out. - Svarre! - You're just like your father. Where is he? We can't do this alone, Harald. Stay here while I get help. I'll be back soon. Hold out, Svarre. Until my father comes. Your father! When a man fights, he becomes another person. Runs round and round. Hears the screams. Hears himself scream. Feels the blood on his face. Tastes it. He forgets why... Faces, eyes, hands. I am cold. If I don't return, your father will know something is wrong. Where is he? He is at Bestlaverk. Svarre! Help! Talking to the dead, eh? The boy talked to him. He knows more than you think. - Frej can talk to him. - You can't trust her. He won't betray his father. We're after a ship not rebels. Get the boy. Grimnir would rather know where the rebels are gathered. Agne doesn't matter. We'll do this my way. Next time, come to me. I am not your enemy. Stay with your mother. You see too little of each other. - They killed Svarre. - Why didn't you come to me at once? - What did Svarre want? - He said... Why are you with Thorgrim? Things are not what they seem. You have to trust me. Why? Because I am your mother. You think I'm on Grimnir's side? Grimnir is our enemy. Sigbard is sure you know where your father is. Holding your tongue will only harm us. You, me and Bjarke. Father wouldn't want that. You must tell me, or I won't be able to help you. Understand? You won't make it without help. Svarre said... - Yes? - What do you want? - Aren't you hungry? Get out! Off you go, Eisa. What's the matter, Harald? You were about to tell me what Svarre told you. Svarre said Father was cut down. They fed his body to the wolves. What? And that you wouldn't care. - Thorgrim! - You're lying! - Let him go. - Answer me! - Where is he! - Let him go! - She has bewitched you. - You killed father! - You forget who you are. - No, you do. You're making a mistake. I've seen a confused lad and a dead peasant. - The men won't have it. - Is that a threat? You're finished, Sigbard. You have broken the law. We must finish that ship as quickly as possible. Everyone must help. Never leave the pitch by the fire, you'll burn the place down. Thorgrim is afraid. He wants to sail the ship home. - If only we can delay it. - You want to kill us? I think this ship may bring good in her wake. - You only think of yourself. - Just like your father. But enough of him, we've a ship to build, and you'll do as I say. Understood? You can't do any more. You've got to go with Thorgrim when the ship's finished. When Svarre doesn't return, my father will know something happened. - We have to think of something. - Like killing Thorgrim's men? They'll only laugh at you. - What's her name? - Heidrun is a good name for her. You can't name her after a goat with mead in her teats. Yes, one that sprays mead at the enemy. Cheers. Look. Who's that then? Bjarke! Bjarke! Come... Pass this through to me. Cheers. Cheers... Jump into the water, swim ashore and hide at home. Hoist it up. Good, Bjarke. What are you doing, Bjarke? What are you doing? Have you gone mad? - Give me that torch. - I'm doing this for you, too. I thought you were different. That you cared about others. About me. But you want to burn me, your mother, Skralling and Gunga. - Come with Bjarke and me. - Where to? - Where would we go? - To my father, where we are safe. - I don't know... - They'd catch us in an instant. Father! It's my father! Father! Father! A ship! Father! What are you waiting for? Father! No! It's been a long time, sonny. How I've missed you! Thorgrim! Thorgrim! I have good news from Grimnir! Harald! Bjarke! I don't know what lies you told the king. But nobody takes my command or my men. You are all alone, Thorgrim. All alone. Come on! Hurry up! We are alike, you and I. We are stubborn. We want to have our way. But only one of us can have things his way. And I think that's me. What do you say? You are silent. A wise choice. It means time to think. But you must think fast. Why protect your father? He is responsible for all this. He lied to the king, the village, your mother, and you. Your father is ravaging the entire coast. - He is burning... - He is fighting for our freedom. His sword mirrors the eyes of the dead. - I don't know where he is. - Do you like Eisa? - I don't know where he is. - Do you like Eisa? You like her because she dropped her apples. But she'll die quickly. Then Bjarke, the boat-builder, your mother. - That's a lot of lives. - How many have you taken? Let's see how strong she is. Chop an arm off. - But I don't know anything! - Watch closely, now. Bestlaverk. He has gone to Bestlaverk. Don't be sad. We're going to sea. Harald, you can't win every time. Let me talk to him. Maybe for the last time. - You want to talk to him? - Yes. You'll give me the next favour. Give her a moment, then send her up to me. Harald! Your father would be proud of you. Eisa is alive. You did your best. Do you hear? I don't hate your father. But one does not choose... ...whom one loves. But one must fight for those one loves. Or everything is meaningless. Harald... Promise me... Promise you will not hate... Will you promise me? Not hate... Don't hate, Harald. Mother. No! Harald! At least take your helmet off. - What's that? - Pitch. Pitch... With the rest of it. Hey, you! Tell the others to get a move on. Drunk... If Sigbard sees you like that he'll kill you. Fire! Get that back up! And you two... - Pitch... - Shh, Bjarke! What's so great about her, Thorgrim? - Nothing you would understand. - We'll soon know. The ship is on fire. The only decent ship I ever built. We ever built. The ship is yours, if you sail her to my father. You wanted to burn my boathouse? You know what's wrong with you? You can't tell your friends from your enemies. - You can sail wherever you want. - Be gone! You make me vomit. It's the ship of your dreams, and only you can sail her. You and your accursed stubbornness. Strike as hard as you can. It's insane. We'll never get her into the water. - Remove the wedges! - Get out of the way, Bjarke. Look, Harald. Here she goes! Ready? - They're coming! - Strike! - What's holding her back? - I don't know. - What are you doing? - Do it yourself. - Maybe we're too few. - Stop this right now! - I'm fed up... - Will you stop arguing! - We're not arguing. - We're just discussing things. Faster! Give us a hand! Hold the ladder, damn you! - Faster! - The knife. Oars! Grab the oars as soon as we're in the water! Grab the oar, idiot! No, not like that! Row! Row! Go on, row! - Row! - Come on, we have a long way to go. - Gunga, forgive me. - Just a mosquito bite. - Keep rowing. - Come on! Don't just sit there. Row! What are you staring at? After them! After them! We're sailing! How far is Bestlaverk? Five days, you stubborn little idiot! Agne rides. The vermin bites... ...his last... The joy of mercy none... The tyrant's pants are wet. The almighty is humbled. Grimnir is crushed. Be gone! This is mine! I have been given these men of Grimnir - - by Agne the warrior. I am under his protection. - So fingers off! - Where is Agne? He has ridden on Grimnir's fortress to spread grief among the mighty, and stamp out every vermin on the way. So the people can rejoice once more. Rejoice once more! They have killed us all. Kill him. Let everyone know, that Agne shows no mercy to Grimnir's folk. No mercy. Let the thrall live. He looks like my son. You're riding a dead man's steed. You're riding a dead man's steed! You're riding a dead man's steed. Does your arm never tire? - Your father's not here. - I won't see him ever again. But that is a good axe. Bring it along. Every man must fight in his own way. I am not a warrior. Or a thrall. Or a ship builder. I am nothing. You are Harald. And you are my friend. Then there is the sky, the sea, the soil, the rest... All you need do is go with the ship. - But the ship is your dream. - No, I'm just a boat builder. Without you, she'd never have been built. Your dream was where she grew forth. A ship is a ship, you see. Or so my old teacher said. Though I never understood what he meant. But he was the only who ever meant anything to me. What about your parents? They thought nothing would become of me. I found myself when I started building ships. - I wasn't bigger than this fella. - A baby can't build a ship. You have to dream it, you understand? Otherwise nothing will grow forth. You yourself dreamt, that we would build your ship. Shall we help this little boy build an even better ship? You'd better believe we will.
