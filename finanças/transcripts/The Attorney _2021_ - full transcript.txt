What happen? Sir, the girl was already dead when we arrived he wouldn't tell us a thing what's your name? Your honour what I have here is a duplicate of evidence d1 miss lo according to an article published on march 29th this year on the 'shock news' website titled 'unjust admission standards at hon yeung school admission tests exempted for principal's friends' as the editor-in-chief, why did you choose to report this? At first, I received complaints from some parents they found out that the children of friends or relatives of the principal were admitted without being interviewed they thought for the children who have worked hard for the admission tests this was really unfair court your honour my client pledges not guilty my client never engaged in any Hawking activities and she didn't set a price on the cardboard therefore, no monetary transaction was involved and the $20 the Indonesian domestic worker gave to my client should be considered as a personal gift not money from a transaction did you continue with your research? I wrote to the school, but I didn't get any response so I did my own research and investigation the crime happened in private property which is managed by a private owners' corporation therefore it was not public property I've noticed in the past few years the number of students who got admitted without an interview kept increasing but the school had no formal explanation I firmly believe in the parents' accusation so I decided to write an expos√© on it thank you, miss lo by the way your daughter also goes to hon yeung international school, right? Yes I'm innocent, your honour granny get up - don't cry - I'm begging you your honour, as a journalist she plays a monitoring role in the incident she makes sure that when choosing their students the school remains fair and consistent her opinion is lawfully and reasonably construed as 'qualified privilege' in the defamation ordinance it shouldn't be considered defamation therefore, her accusation of defamation should be ruled false my client is an elderly lady who lives alone she has diabetes and needs long-term medication she could have applied for social security assistance but she didn't she believes she can provide for herself your honour temper justice with mercy will you consider an appeal? Granny, any thoughts? What's your plan going forward? Do you think the ruling was fair? Granny is innocent she doesn't have to bear responsibility for this we're extremely upset with the adjudication we'll study the verdict and consider an appeal don't mess up again or I'll charge you full price next time I'm not a big corporation how can I afford you as my legal consultant? I'll ask for your advice whenever I'm in doubt I've got to go, bye-bye Kelvin lost 12 cases in a row what an exceptional legal genius don't say that about him I know, you won 12 cases in a row drop me off at the post office what for? I finally collected the entire set, I'm sending them to Elise surprise! You're sending to my daughter these dolls what a cheap surprise what do you know about girls? This morning a female corpse was found in an industrial building in ngau tau kok 25-year-old male suspect, Lee, was arrested on site the victim is identified as Hong Kong billionaire kwok sai-wing's daughter preliminary evidence suggests cause of death as excessive blood loss from a fractured skull the authorities have classified this as a rape and murder case kwok sai-wing refused to comment on his daughter's murder you met her at the bar, she invited you home you got drunk after having sex with her she was dead next to you when you woke up? Yes the door was locked you were the only one in the house if it wasn't you, who the hell was it? Officer, I didn't do it I didn't kill anyone, I didn't kill her I... remember now I heard some noise when I was sleeping enough! If you knew how to solve it, you would have already then I smelled something acidic when I woke up again, there you all were what acidic smell? Didn't you say you were blackout drunk? You trying to give me a false statement? I didn't give a false statement, I was really drunk! I didn't kill her! Slow down, take it easy if you don't remember clearly then let's not record this part of the statement no! I mean it, I remember smelling something acidic check if this statement is all right if it's fine, sign it meanwhile, it's important that you assist our investigation understand? Take a look sign it if it's all right officer, I'm Lee yat-fung's grandmother someone called today and said he got arrested I'm here to bail him out I'm officer chiu, I'm in charge of this case we are formally charging your grandson with murder you can't bail him out now there must be a mistake, officer my grandson is a delinquent, but he won't kill anyone let me see him and talk to him directly the suspect is not feeling well and we have a regulation we have the right to reject anyone who might compromise the investigation you can't see him today you should go back and find him a good lawyer Don't do that, paying the fine means admitting guilt you didn't steal the cardboard, I'll be filing an appeal for you don't worry about the retainer I'll call you later Kelvin don't worry, I'm not your boss just pay your rent on time but seriously, losing 12 cases in a row is as difficult as winning 12 in a row like me keep it up I'm not losing, it's just that I haven't won yet don't be so petty you get paid regardless, so you can afford your rent barrister lui the law might be a business to you, but it is sacred to me I won't give up until I win very good, keep it up attorney cheung, wait here, I've notified barrister ho okay, thanks attorney cheung I've already hired you yes why do I need to hire another lawyer? Granny Lee, I'm a solicitor and Lee yat-fung's case is a criminal case so we need a barrister to represent him in court I don't want him to be my grandson's lawyer it's not him Granny Lee, please come with me barrister ho you must help my grandson, he's innocent did you give me a discount on the retainer? It's okay, charge me the normal price it's more important that you help my grandson I'm begging you granny, relax, don't worry about the retainer I really want to see him is there anything you can do to help? I promise I'll arrange a meeting as soon as possible he really is innocent, he really is he won't do anything like this What's the plan? Department of justice hasn't pressed charges yet according to Lee yat-fung's statement when he was sleeping in the victim's workshop he heard some loud noises this building has only one apartment on each floor there are factory outlets on other floors normally, nobody would be around at these hours "Manslaughter" any problems? Doesn't the law guarantee everyone the right to a fair trial? You want him to confess before the department of justice presses charges? Besides a plea bargain, what better suggestion do you have? Kelvin we are defense attorneys, not Sherlock Holmes kwok ka-yee's killer is not the main focus and is not our responsibility the key to this case is how to give our clients the biggest advantage this is a simple principle you should've learned that during your first year of law school I learned that 'everyone is equal before the law' everyone should be considered innocent until proven guilty Okay Indian lettuce us$1o thank you Auntie chu you grandson is being accused of murder it's a tough case stop talking about murder my grandson never killed anyone Barrister ho might not be able to help you go find barrister cheung he's good at handling cases like this Take this cheque, he is quite expensive We won't accept any compensation from the kwok's that's right! Listen to me, calm down Mr. Lui, conciliation out of court is your best option everyone will lose if we go to court let me tell you we won't stop suing until we're at the court of final appeal as the major landlord of sing fu shopping mall you must bear all responsibility for this incident objection the plaintiff has made an unreasonable accusation as the plaintiff fails to prove the collapse of sing fu shopping mall ls directly correlated with the quality of construction materials provided by kwok properties the collapse is purely accidental and is not caused by human negligence I now pronounce that kwok group is not obliged to pay compensation the plantiff must settle all court and tribunal fees you didn't know about this? We only know that his daughter goes to a boarding school in the UK but no one asked where her mother was 'The law holds that it is better that ten guilty persons escape than that one innocent party suffer' - sir William blackstone Do you smell cigarettes? I promised someone I'd quit you used to be quite righteous you helped the underprivileged fight against the high wall what happened? You're oversimplifying things so if everyone stands on the side of the egg the high wall will fall by itself? Leave it here The most pressing issue is to let auntie chu see her grandson piece of cake you don't have to do a thing in there I guarantee dicky will see auntie chu before his hearing okay? Thank you Mr. Lee I'm ho hok-ming, your grandmother hired me to represent you what about my grandma? Why isn't she here? I'm arranging a meeting for you is she all right? Where is she now?

Yes officer, since you forgot to turn off the cctv you might as well be my witness turn if off, please Mr. Lee yat-fung from now on, I am officially your defense attorney if anyone asks you about what happened that night all you have to say is 'I'm sorry, I'm unwell, I don't want to answer your questions' okay?

Hccc96/2020, defendant Lee yat-fung is suspected of murdering kwok ka-yee, a female of Chinese descent on the night of 18 oct prosecutor, please summon your witness to testify your honour I'd like to summon Mr. Chan kwok-sing, bartender at king pub, to testify what did you see that night? The victim drank a lot that night Thank you hottie this is for you how did the victim react when the defendant bought her a drink? Piss off fine the victim ignored him and the guy just walked off witness you said the victim turned down my client do you remember what the victim said? The victim told the defendant to 'piss off' according to your statement my client flirted with the victim that night and the victim told my client to 'piss off' is that right? Yes that's not possible this is a screen capture from the cctv that night it was completely packed I went to king pub myself and did a simple experiment I recognize him, that night... I recognize him music was loud, with strong bass speakers the noise level was over 90 decibels witness, could you really hear what the victim said? Yes witness, you must have ridiculously good hearing your honour, I'd like to summon my client Lee yat-fung Mr. Lee yat-fung please tell us what happened that night that night I met Angie at the pub hottie, this is for you what's your name? Angie then she invited me over to her studio When we got to her studio we had a few more drinks then I hugged her we started kissing Then we had sexual intercourse After that we drank again I had too much to drink, so I passed out and then what happened?

Around 11:45pm you said you had a lovely chat with the victim can you tell us what you two talked about? She told me about her art installation at moma in New York a new acquaintance who's pretty and cute do you admit that you were instantly attracted to her? Objection calls for speculation your honour, this is not speculation this directly reflects on the defendant's motive to rape overruled, defendant must answer the question please answer the question yes I admit... Evidence suggests that you consumed a lot of alcohol at her studio can you tell us how much you drank? 3 bottles of red wine and a bottle of whiskey sorry I'm afraid I might be mishearing it the spectators and the jury might have missed it too can you repeat how much you drank that night? 3 bottles of red wine and a bottle of whiskey I don't think my entire family can finish all that did you get drunk? Yes that's why he raped the victim - it was consensual - you took off the victim's clothes but she refused and pushed you away she kept struggling, and you couldn't control yourself so your raped and killed her No, I didn't kill her! You just have to answer yes or no it was your plan all along since the moment you met you used her interest in art to lure her back to her studio you pretended to share her interest just so you can rape her when she was drunk but the victim wasn't drunk enough, so she fought back you were worried about the consequences so you decided to rape and kill the victim - it was your plan all along - no! Unforgiveable no! I didn't do it! That's not true! Your honour, I have no further questions Your honour I'd like to summon our witness, chan sze-man witness, please tell us your relationship with the victim we were partners at work, and we hung out sometimes sometimes we went out drinking, we even traveled together I was drinking with kwok ka-yee at king pub that night when you were drinking what were you doing when the defendant flirted with the victim?

If I let you stay in the United States things might not have turned out this way you're the most important person in my life why don't you tell me? What do I have to do to bring you back? Answer me Mr. Kwok, there's still something you can do I'm lui yau-fai, the defense attorney on your daughter's case I'm sorry this is the only way I can approach you I recognize you, what do you want? To seek the truth so that the real murderer can be punished Tsim sha tsui, central, admiralty, wan chai you can see all of Hong Kong in a glance there are only a handful of rich and powerful people there are two right here kwok group went public in 1984 at the time, councillors like you kept arguing with the brits at the legislative council I remember you once said 'kwok, the world will change if we work together then we'll be in charge of everything' but it seems that you're the only one taking charge things have changed, I'm old and faded how can I compare myself to you? Is that right? What happened to Angie will be over soon but we still need to live on when chi-wai's election is over next month let's go to xi'an together with the delegation let's take a break and enjoy ourselves... I finally know who the murderer is I've been looking for Angie all night are you with her right now? I was at the workshop, and the password was changed what do you want? I'm on my way to the airport, she told me not to give you the password I'm outside the workshop, just tell me 3690', don't let her know I told you all right, I got in these were all found in your daughter's computer and cat's cellphone I'll take all the blame, as a father... Your bastard son killed my daughter! The vacuum cleaner was filled with his DNA this is a lab report of the vacuum cleaner from your daughter's workshop it states clearly that tsang chi-wai's DNA was found in the bag no one can prove the authenticity of this anonymous document the judge might not even accept this as evidence in court chi-wai will definitely be elected in the by-election eventually, he'll be the chairman of cfp his people will take over if you give him a chance you're also giving youself a chance you should have guessed who Angie's real murderer is I can help you put him behind bars this is the last thing you can do for your daughter I funded his election campaign and your entire organization he killed my daughter, and I still have to prop him up? Are you two out of your goddamn minds? Did you forget? If no one supported you they wouldn't always be building a subway station next to your land or stop building public housing whenever you introduce a new housing project without cfp's support your ship would've sunk a long time ago this is proof that for the past 12 years cfp councillors have been reserving land along the subway to kwok group for private residential development Angie and chi-wai are not our only burdens we are responsible for many people if we go down the economy will go down with us, Mr. Kwok how much are you willing to sacrifice for your daughter? My daughter is the only one I'm burdened with today I'm old I only realized after she's gone that we can't take anything to our graves nothing here matters anymore I knew the boat would sink the moment I invited you over you think I'm only taking you down? I'm taking the entire cfp down! Your son or cfp you make the call, not me I've been subpoenaed as a witness they just want you to testify just be careful with what you say I don't know what other witnesses will be present I'll get a barrister to teach you what to say just be calm and careful it'll be fine "Be a good lawyer" court Your honour I'll now summon our second defense witness, tsang chi-wai Witness reports claim that you had an affair with the victim is that true? Witness, please answer my question is it true? Yes can you explain your relationship with the victim before she was murdered? We had broken up broken up?

You gotta pay your tuition I'm kwok sai-wing's attorney I'm here to see inspector fung please wait all the trade details between kwok group and cfp are right here I'm here to turn myself in don't act on impulse you're not doing anyone any good all I want is justice whoever played a part in my daughter's murder will not see the light of day Barrister lui, these officers are here for you Mr. Lui yau-fai we've received complaints claiming that you've falsified documents please come with us for further investigation okay The falsification claim might not go through it's just a routine investigation by the bar association oh yeah so I can write whatever I want? Joe, when was the last time you took a tram? Do you believe that Lee yat-fung committed murder? I shouldn't be answering this question nor should you be asking it Same old mistake, interference with witness this is not the original recording it can't be presented as evidence in court do you believe in it? Barrister chan Hong-iai I would like to seek your legal advice based on attorney-client privilege are you willing to accept my employment and keep our conversation strictly confidential? Why not? How can I help you? Hypothetically speaking I have a friend who wants to prank another friend and put trash into his friend's vacuum bag that isn't his friend's then remember to tell your friend you cannot be certain that everything is 100% true it's just unprofessional conduct they won't confiscate everything if the price is reasonable, I promise it'll go through Gentlemen on legal terms, falsification of documents means forging or modifying a document with the intention to deceive in order to obtain benefits with this incident my client acted on impulse and pulled a prank My client took this vacuum bag for re-examination and received this new report my client gave this new report to Mr. Kwok sai-wing theoretically, my client did not falsify this new report therefore, my client did not commit the offense of forging or modifying a document this is a lab report of the vacuum cleaner from your daughter's workshop it states clearly that there are traces of tsang chi-wai's DNA when my client gave this report to kwok sai-wing he stressed that he's uncertain about the authenticity of this report who wants to prank another friend you cannot be certain that everything is 100% true no one can prove the authenticity of this anonymous document the judge might not even accept this as evidence in court therefore, my client did not have the intention to deceive although this report indirectly caused tsang chi-wai's conviction but what did my client gain from it? Tsang chi-wai, or even Lee yat-fung whomever is the killer, or is punished bylaw has nothing to do with my client and due to this falsification claim my client's professionalism has been challenged and he might even face disbarment I would like to ask what benefits did my client get from all this? Barrister lui yau-fai before we make our ruling do you have anything else to say? Gentlemen my daughter is 10 years old she was born on the day that her mother died that was also the day of the sing fu shopping mall incident she was born prematurely I remember how afraid I was, holding her for the first time I wasn't afraid that she wouldn't grow up I wasn't afraid of raising her alone either I was afraid of what kind of world I have brought her in to I told my daughter that I'll make sure she grows up in a world that is fair and just someone once told me that no one needs justice and fairness anymore even if you sacrifice yourself fighting for it no one will care or even remember nobody needs these things if this is what our world has become our children will have to live in a world without faith, principles, and justice can you live with that? What about being an attorney? What can attorneys do for this world? I once asked myself how I can defend justice should I be like everyone else standing alongside the egg against the high wall? The stability we enjoy today is the result of hard work from our previous generation no fine and no prison time isn't it our responsibility to give our children a world without prejudice against wealth and social status where everyone is equal before the law? Daddy daddy you've gained weight I've missed you, daddy me too have you been smoking? - Nope - gross! Give me a kiss let's go count me in, let's rent an office together what about DOJ? Take it as my deposit what's wrong? Aren't you gonna give me a chance? Bye-bye what does this mean?
