It's okay! I'm fine. See you at the shrine tonight? Where are you going? Yuki! -Just stay there. Stay there! Rubber. You filthy brat. This is nice and cool. There. Tell and I'll hit you. I won't tell. I'll buy you a drink. Nobuyuki! Tasuku! Where were you? What happened? Did you get one? I can't come tonight. We have a guest in the bungalow. Tomorrow? Can you come to our place at 6? Why? The guest is kind of weird. I don't want to be alone around him. An old guy? See you. Tasuku got a bad bruise. It must hurt. Nobuyuki, look out for him, will you? Stay out of it. His dad's always had a temper. Thanks. -Where are you going? Take your plates! Help. Wait! You don't understand. Understand what? She followed me. -Like hell! How else would we be here alone? -Liar! Calm down! I asked her to come and she did. -Stop lying! Do I look like I'd force her? Why would I come? Kill him. Kill him for me, Nobuyuki. What are you talking about?! This is crazy. Settle down, will you! Cut it out! You saw her! She loved it! She loved it! Get off me! I'll kill you! I'll kill you! I'll kill you! Meet me at 6:30. Where? The lookout. Your dad again? -Look. I'm okay if you're there. Are you going to the shrine? Go home! -No. You'll get hit again. Dad's out fishing. Are you meeting Mika? Tell me the rest. The sun made the other islands, so they're big. The moon made this one, so it's small. Thanks. He's going to kill you someday. Pretty, huh? What's that? A tsunami? Oh, no. No! It can't be! Wow! "And Then There Was Light" "25 years later" Could a crow raise the net and untie a garbage bag? They're evolving. -Be serious. Those people don't pick through household garbage. Then who messed it up? Highly evolved crows? -Crows! Cup. Which one? Chocolate or strawberry? Strawberry. We need a new place. Yeah. I'm going. No! No! No! Put them on! I don't want to go to kindergarten today! Get dressed! -No! You'll be late! -No! Come on! -Don't shout. See you. Bye, Tsubaki. Bye. Thank you. "Construction Notice" Morning. Look at this. It's disgusting! There's a lunatic around. What a mess. Garbage all over the place! We've been here 20 years! You're still young. You could buy a condo. Your husband works at City Hall. Did I wake you? Can't you tell? Sorry. I'll come back. You never have enough, do you? Your husband..... How does he do it with you? Why do you want to know? Because I worry about you. Forget it. If he satisfied you, you wouldn't be coming here. I've got to go. Leave your key. There's nothing to steal. Sometimes my husband kisses my toes. Just like you did. Three who love sucking. I'm back. -Hi. Want supper? Just something light. There are new condos in Kosugi. Yeah? Around here it's all homeless people and empty buildings. I like it here. But what if something happened? Like what? Nothing much happens here. Tsubaki got mud on her smock again. So what? I keep telling her to keep clean. She's a bit dense. You keep thinking she'll just act like you want. What did you see? The feeling is very strong. You were born somewhere beautiful. How did you know? You've kept most of your profile hidden, haven't you? It's nice to be mysterious... ...but I'm sure we'd all like to know more. Can our fortune-teller say more about where that place might be? I feel a strong guardian spirit suited to... ...a beautiful place like that. I have to go in early. One of the old guys got sick. I haven't got time for you today. That's not why I came. Then why did you come? That apartment complex suffocates me. Everyone's all show. All they talk about is buying condos, entrance exams,... ...and sports clubs. And you come here when you want to sweat. Jerk. Your husband doesn't know? -Why would he? My daughter's a failure. She's strange. How old is she? Nearly five. She's a failure already? Would you draw a white sun in a blue sky? That's strange, right? I'm not a parental counselor. I'm going. Are you sure it's not the moon your daughter's drawing? Maybe you've never seen it. A great big white moon in a pure-black sky. At night the moon paints a white road in the sea. It's beautiful. Mrs Kurokawa! Mrs Kurokawa! It's Tsubaki! She was attacked! Does it hurt anywhere? It hurts a little where I pee. We'll look at that. That won't hurt. She was outside at the kindergarten,... ...then suddenly she was gone. They searched for her... ...and found her crying at a playground nearby. She says a man took her in his car. The beer doesn't affect you? It wakes up my mind. What's it like to have your mind awakened? Things become clearer. Like what? Miki Shinoura, actress. No one knows who she really is. Our cameras follow her in her daily life. What should we do? About what? Tsubaki, of course! Just leave her be. She's young. If we ignore it, she'll forget all about it. Are you serious? How can you be so calm?! Is that what it looks like? It's for her own good. I love it. The sea links the entire world. And it's deep. It leads to worlds we can't imagine. Like acting does? Yes. 'Knowing' is boring. But we have to link the world. What is the sea to actress Miki Shinoura? Memory. I can't separate those memories... ...from who I am now. They're linked. Just like the sea. Shall we go? Well? She's asleep. Yeah? She had a bad dream. What's going to become of her? What do we do? She'll never forget this! You said nothing happens here, but something just did! So now what?! What do you want? Huh? Shall I kill him? I'll find who did it and kill him. Will you be satisfied then? Stop it! What are you talking about? That's crazy! Oh? -Of course it is! Then why do you keep asking me what we're going to do? If you want me to help, you must want revenge. You'll catch a cold. I don't know who you are. You aren't telling me things! Neither are you. "Visitor" Tasuku. Yuki! It's been 25 years since we left the island. I read about you. "Kurokawa Nobuyuki of the Harbor Section." You've come a long way, Nobuyuki. I waited outside the City Hall and followed you home. I put my ear to the door and heard your wife and daughter. So your wife is the woman cheating on her husband with me? I haven't asked. -Why not? Tell me what you want. Money! Private schools won't want a kid whose mother sleeps around. I don't care. You'd better talk to my wife. Either way, it's money I earn. You're not mad? I did it with your wife! Stop calling my office. Then where do I reach you? You stopped coming. Did he find out? He doesn't know. Then you can still come over. No. Why not? Tsubaki. What? She was molested. When I was with you. I can't come any more. What did he say? Nothing. Like nothing happened. The bastard. What did you want him to do? I don't know. I just don't know. Your mom might not be back. So next you kill for your daughter? What does this concern? You know damn well, Nobuyuki. I know what you did. And I've got proof. I know what kind of guy you are. I don't know what you mean. It's simple. What you did that time for Mika. You can't ignore me. I'll call you back. Could I have your number, please? I don't have a phone. Come to the plant, or my place. Ask your wife where it is. Kokandori 3-4-41, Apartment 202. Visitor! It's been 10 years. Go away. I'm at work. I was out at sea, and you were up at the lookout. It's a miracle we both survived. Get back to work! Who's he? You want the police? -My dad. Then say so! What? Money. Where's your place? What do you want? Sit down. Tasuku..... Did you kill someone? The old lighthouse-keeper died, and they sent me his stuff. There was a letter with it. It wasn't me. Don't lie. He said you did it. No. Nobuyuki and Mika strangled him. Who's going to believe that? I took a picture of the body. After Nobuyuki strangled him. Show me. I was ten. How would I strangle a grown man? I guess not. Dad... ...you know the actress Miki Shinoura? That's Mika. Instead of threatening me... ...just send the picture. She's got lots of money. What a loser! So how do we get the money? A fake account? She can just send it. I guess. You're childhood friends, after all. We're the island ghosts, I guess. The ones left alive. Come in. There you are. Black? Tasuku sent me a picture. What's going on? You didn't get one? He's floating around, but I've just ignored him. How did he get it? I don't know. So what do we do? What's his big idea? Tell him to give you the picture. How? I don't want to see him. I'll do it. "I think you know what I mean." Send 3 million. Tasuku." That idiot! It won't stop with this. You find a use for it, then. No. -Yes. Take it. You're my only hope. Please. Put it away. Are you married? Children? A girl, five. That sounds nice. What does? I'm a wreck. Like I'm freezing cold. Why? Since I stopped seeing you... ...I'm not happy or sad. I'm just alive... ...hoping you won't be hurt again. Can we still be human... ...if we return violence with violence? You mean 'sin'? It's not sin. It's doing what needs to be done. Maybe. But it's hard pretending to be human. Eating meals, talking to people..... Tell me if it goes well. Mika..... Why did you piss here? Go to the toilet! Cut it out! She isn't answering! You're lying about Mika. I'll tell the cops, or the papers... ...my son's a murderer! -Get out of here! Take this and get out! Out! You punk! That stinks! Cleaning at this hour? Yeah. You drink a lot. I don't drink. My dad's here. Yoichi? How is he? Same as ever. He wants money. Why are you here? -'Why'? You phoned me. Two weeks ago. You said you have proof. What is it? Mika told you. Mika? I haven't seen her in 20 years. A picture of the dead guy. With the marks on his neck. I took it. Where is it? Your picture. Show me. It's not here. Dad hid it somewhere. I'm wasting my time. Wait! I sent a copy to Miki Shinoura. You're idiots. You and your dad. It's too bad you both didn't die in that tsunami. I think so, too. You always hated me, didn't you? You should have killed me then. Just kidding. You need money? Why do you ask? I'll give you some. And you find all the copies and give them to me. For Mika, right? She put you onto this! -Don't be silly. Everything you do is for her. You didn't care when I got hit! Why? What was so great about her? What I do... ...is for my family. What if Mika won't pay? Then I'm next. As long as your dad has proof... ...he could expose me any time. Look, Tasuku... ...if you give me the picture and leave my family alone... ...I'll help you out. Help me? With money... ...and I'll kill your dad for you. For me? -Yes. Where do you want to go? The river. The river? There's the river right there. An amusement park, then. -An amusement park? okay. We'll go soon. Look up there. The stars are out. Stars! What kind of dreams are you having lately? I don't know. Do you remember any of them? There's a big black dog. Maybe a wolf. A wolf? That's scary. It's chasing me. It's going to eat me up! I'm scared! Help me, Daddy! -It's okay. It's okay, Tsubaki. I can run really fast. I'll take you and we'll run away. You're lying! You can't do that. A wolf runs really fast. I'm not lying. Watch! Is your dad still here? Yes. Pain in the ass? He looked like it. If you've got trouble, tell us. I'm okay. I've got a guardian angel. Yeah, right! 3 million and sleeping pills. Put them in his drink. Then find the picture. "Mysterious actress a tsunami survivor" Miki Shinoura's from Mihama. Yeah? Wait. I want to talk. About what? Lately your clothes smell of cigarette smoke. Are you seeing someone? Your lover. Shall I say it again? The guy you're sleeping with. While some pervert... ...was having his way with Tsubaki... ...some garbage was having its way with you! Stop it. Stop it! I bum cigarettes at work. I'm disobedient, like Tsubaki. Oh. Dad. Dad! Where's that picture? Come on, Dad. Is it hard on you? Why are you alive, Dad? Without that tsunami, would we have been happy? No. It started before that. It's sad. Why are we so miserable? Dad... ...die. Some lives are better off never being lived. Shall I kill you? Don't be in a hurry. You're going to help me, right? After you get me the picture. Yeah? Then you'll be free. Kill him for me. Like you did for Mika. How was Namiko? My wife. Nice and dirty. We're not like Mommy, are we. How so? We know what violence is like and she doesn't. If violence hurts you, you have to give violence back. Mom doesn't know that. That's why I killed someone. Oh? Living things live by killing. I love it here! She should go to summer school. Right? In kindergarten? It's normal. Did you go? We couldn't afford it. Nor me. That's why I want Tsubaki to go. So she'll get into good schools and grow up with the right people. Will that make her happy? Of course. Are you sure? Admit who she is. What? Then you'll find yourself. Die, Dad! Kill him, Yuki! Wake up, Guardian Angel! Kill! Dad! Kill! Die! Love! Die! Love! Die! Love! Love! Die! Die! Ow! What do you want? The picture. I can't find it. Make him tell you. I tried. I told you to kill him. You poor guy. You kill him. Why? You're turning on me? Why can't you? 'Why'? Once you've killed someone, it's not such a big thing. I'll come back. Don't go... ...Yuki. You stink! "In the shrine woods I found... ...the body of the man staying in the bungalow." What? It doesn't say I killed him. Dad... ...you pack more of a punch now. Where are you? Hospital. You're in the clear? Yeah. Must've been rough. I've got something to show you. What? I dug your dad a grave. Yuki..... We won't need it now. Come and help me fill it in. I'm taking a trip. A trip? With Dad gone, I'm free. If I'm not back in a week, could you deliver this? Sure. Why isn't your name on it? Dad was having it off with someone's wife. If her husband finds out, he'll be pissed off at me. I want her to have that. Where are you going? Somewhere beautiful,... ...with sea and mountains... ...to take it easy. It's open. You're not asleep? I was. My condolences. Forget it. I brought snacks. We'll send him off. Canned crab? Cheers. Can I have the picture? The negative? I threw it away ages ago. That's all there is. Yeah? -Yes! I sent Mika a color copy. The old lighthouse keeper's dead now, but Dad told me... ...he'd stayed on the island. Why? -I don't know. What would you do if you were there alone? Maybe... ...nothing. Look at the sea. And? Wait. Forever. I think I might plant some trees. The tsunami killed them all. I'd have lots of time to plant. On the mountain, in the village. There's no one there to say no. You know... ...for a long time I've been wondering. What I should have done. About what? When we were kids, of course. Living on the island, having fun. 'Fun'? Yeah. Swimming in the sea. Remember how we'd pick berries and eat them? With Mika and Kotomi? Yeah. That was fun. I should have stayed there with the lighthouse keeper. Why did everyone leave? What's it like there now? It must be beautiful. The greenest time of year. Yeah. Tasuku... ...it was really hard for you, wasn't it. Yoichi used to hit you, and you were always in tears... ...but everyone ignored you. It was okay. I'm not ignored now. No one hits me. You did great. I bought condoms from the lighthouse keeper. I had sex with Mika. I even killed a man. And you never told. And all the time... ...Yoichi was knocking you around, you were crying... ...and I did nothing. Not then, not later. I felt terrible. That's why I dug you a grave for him. But too late. Yuki..... I'm sorry. If I can believe that. You did nothing wrong. It was that island. That island with nothing but sea and tsubaki flowers... ...and crazy trees. And those damn hot summers. That's why you killed that guy. And why you can't get over Mika. I can't get over you, either. But that has nothing to do with good or bad. From the time we were born... ...that island was shit. And you were king of that island of shit. My guardian angel. Next you kill me, right? In there. -Here? Wow! When did you dig this? Wow! It's like you made a secret base. Like we did back home. It's a shame to fill it in, Yuki. Hey, Yuki..... I wanted it this way. I sorted things out with Tasuku. And the picture? In my briefcase. I gave that to you. No, thanks. I don't want money. Then... ...what do you want? Stop it! Then never eat again! I want Daddy! Eat your food! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! She's asleep. I haven't seen your husband for a while. Are things all right? He's not coming back. I thought so. I just don't know what to do! It's cooled off now the typhoon is gone. When does Mika get back? I don't know. How long are you planning to stay, Mr Kurokawa? I'm not fully in the loop... ...but I hope you're under no illusions about Ms Shinoura. What do you mean? You're not the only one. Her talents extend beyond acting. When she is in need of something, she is good at getting people... ...or good at getting men, to act on her behalf. Is that clear enough? I have no idea what you're talking about. Do you enjoy coercing women into sleeping with you? "Mrs Namiko Kurokawa" I'm the man you slept with in that filthy apartment. I struck up a conversation with you... ...to get close to your husband. He knows about the relationship between me and you. He has been to that apartment. This is hard to write. I'll write it like a factory log. 1. Your husband and I, and Miki Shinoura... ...were born on Mihama Island. We survived the tsunami. 2. Your husband is a murderer. Look at the negative. 3. I am almost certainly dead. I'm more or less fine with that. In fact, I'm afraid to die. But that very fear makes me want to. So... ...I feel like I'm just waiting. I'm tired. You can leave, or we can have sex. I want a shower. I gave you the picture and the money. I did everything you..... -And we had sex. To hide the past. -No! Mika! I'm in love with you! -You, too! Just like all the men I offer myself to as a reward. You said kill him! -I did not! That was your idea. Whatever. It was all for you. I won't threaten you. And Tasuku will never threaten you again. You must know I killed him. You said 'please'. -Stop it! I never asked for that! We've known him all our lives. Why?! What are you doing?! You must have realized what I might do. That's why you gave me the money and said 'please'. No! So will you die yourself if I say 'please'? It's like I was waiting... ...for you to ask that. Can I ask you something? That night... ...before you saw me... ...were you smiling? Would that satisfy you? Since that night... ...I feel nothing. You want? Now? Sex? A huge wave... ...is going to carry me far away. Want some sausage? How many? -Two. I'm back. Daddy! Pick me up! Tsubaki! I'm sorry I didn't come home. Where were you? On business. -What did you buy me? I was too busy. Do you know that if you wait it's sure to come? Like that tsunami, without any reason to it. It's always there, underneath the surface of the everyday.
