A long, long time ago... ...when the Vislans lived by the Vistula... ...the Buzans by the Bug, and Goplans by the Goplo... ...when each tribe had their own gods... ...cruel Popiel came to power... ...to be eaten by mice in the end. Written by from the novel by J.I. Kraszewski starring with camera operator sound edited by militaria and horse training make up artists costume designers executive producer music by production designer directors of photography produced by co-director directed by "Unworthy of power is he who abuses his authority." Chronicler Wincenty Kadlubek, 13th Century What do you see? Blood... ...blood... Two brothers... in blood. A fortress on fire... mice... I see you, Prince. And mice... mice everywhere. You're lying! I slaughtered all the Mousey tribe! I see you... Prince... - And the tower in flames. - Lying old witch! Stone doesn't burn! The dungeon will teach you to tell other fortunes! This prophecy comes from the spirits! I'll put out your fires! I'll drive the fortune tellers away! And raze the shrines to the ground! Don't seek war with the Gods. War with people will suffice! THE OLD TALE WHEN THE SUN WAS GOD We went for Poznan, we went for Poznan. We went for Poznan, we went for Poznan. We conquered Poznan, we conquered Poznan. Weapons we captured, weapons we captured... ...took captives and loot, took captives and loot. Some may rejoice... the others shall weep. Victory! Victory! Victory! Victory! Victory... ...my Lord, victory! - And the young Princes? - Alive and well, sir! They were supposed to perish! Praised be the Gods! Neither of the two died in combat! The Guardian kept an eye on them! Curse on the Guardian! Pour it into the mead. For sleep. Eternal sleep? No. Not yet. Glory to the victors! Glory! Glory! Glory! What about Poznan? Glory! Mother, whose head is it? - Head of a fool. - Why did he die? For revolting against your Father. I want to cut off heads, too. You'll be the prince, my son. And you'll cut off the heads of those who oppose you. Victory! - Which one fought better? - Hard to tell. - With sword? - No difference. - With axe? - No difference. Guardian, please approach me. Thank you for bringing up my nephews so well. Praise him! Praise! Praise! My honored Uncles... and you, members of my tribe. When my brother died 10 years ago... ...you granted me the rule... ...till his sons become men. That day has come. Tomorrow I'll pass the rule to the one pointed out by the Gods. Which of the two will become Prince? Which will get power... the fortress and the army? And which of the two will get... ...nothing? To the Gods' verdicts! Let them be praised! Praise! Praise! Are you afraid? To shed one's kin's blood... is the worst of all crimes. I share a coward's bed? I bought you, bitch! You were a slave! - I gave you a son. - Because I fucked you. I gave a son to a ruler, not to a serf! Tomorrow, you'll bow to the new Prince... ...and your tribe will never recognize your son. He'll lose everything... ...even his life. Go... Let this blood fall upon me. Make way! Is the knife yours? It is. You killed your brother. No. I don't remember. I remember nothing. And what do you say? The law says... ...death for death. Death for death! Death for death! A horrid crime... ...killing one's own brother. The law says... ...death for death. But the murderer... ...comes from our tribe. Let us not shed our kin's blood. Let us be merciful. Let us have mercy. Blind him! No! They believed the story. Nobody even doubted. - And the Guardian? - Him? I'm the rightful ruler now. - And what about your son? - A son is his father's heir. - Even the one born of a slave? - I'll make them vow by the Sun. And if they don't believe? Then, the whole tribe will be- No. They'll rebel. Take the peasants' sons hostage. Whoever crosses this circle perishes! A witch! Maybe a witch. We know how to deal with witches. I'm next! Where did you come from? From the woods. - You 're good at playing a witch. - You've seen me? So... that was you? They took it for your witchcraft. My father will reward you. You can do it yourself. How? By kissing me. - Have you gone mad? - I guess I have. Thank you. I'll be back. Get inside! - The Prince sends his regards. - That means... ...an order. So it does. Send two sons to the fortress. - And if I refuse? - We could come back with hundreds. One son will be enough. Sambor! You'll go. No! Go away! Woman, go away. Father, don't give me into slavery! Not you I'm sending but my eyes. You, here? They're taking from all families. - No entry. - Why not? The Prince has fallen ill. My time is coming to an end. You'll get well, if the Gods permit. Before I close my eyes, please vow to recognize my son as the Prince. Swear by the Sun. A slave's son cannot be our ruler. He is my son. But a slave bore him. Then he must die. For peace's sake. - To avoid future turmoil. - No! Oh, Gods, no! I'm begging you... I implore... His life... I'm begging you... Spare his life. Spare his life... I'm cold. So very cold. Some mead... I beg you. Some mead... mead... please! I don't want to quarrel... ...before I join our forefathers. Let's drink to concord. All right. Thank you. Now I can leave in peace. To concord. To concord. To concord. Concord. - To concord. - To concord. My entrails are on fire! Mine, too. The mead isn't so hot... It's poison! Treason! You refused to recognize my son. Die, you swine! Curse on you! You shall perish as we do! You and your bastard offspring! And that bitch of yours! People! They're killing each other! The Prince is still alive. But they... They fought for power, like beasts! Remove the corpses! Make offerings to the Gods for the Prince's life. I'm back! I know. - You're here at last. - Leave and don't come back. And why? Because I like you. I like you as well. - Very much so. - That's bad. Why? Because I could fall in love with you. - You fear to love? - No. But I mustn't. You're still a maiden. My Father promised me to the Gods. - You want to be a priestess? - I wanted to. And now? - Run away with me. - What? Run away. I don't even know your name. Stay here. He can't escape. Good shot. Who are you? A hunter. Why did you help me? One to five is not a fair fight. You're wearing Thor's hammer. You were with the Vikings. You're Ziemowit, Piast's son. I knew your Father. - I can't do it here. - Our farm's nearby. Will you manage to ride? Hide the corpses, or they'll burn down your house. What's wrong? I wonder if the peasants believed. What difference does it make? The Guardian didn't believe, and he's already yonder. Who's there? Znosek, sir! - Important news! - Come in! Only a horse came back from the chase. Follow them. I will, my Lady. Slaughtering... ...one's own kin is the worst crime. This calls for an assembly! A custom long forgotten. Not by all! Hold on. Now. And if it was poisoned? Sear the wound! - You want to call a meeting? - That's my intent, yes! I'll pass the word out and it will spread - on and on. - The Prince is vindictive. - Might ask for your head. - Let him! No felon will rule over us. - You want to elect a new Prince? - A Prince? Whatever for? The tribes will rule as in the past. The neighbors will invade you. They'll grind you... ...to dust. They won't. They never did and never will. Tomorrow I'll ask your father for your hand. If he refuses... You'll draw the Gods' wrath on us! The shrine is a day away. Stay here, gather your strenghts. The shrine is a day away. Stay here, gather your strenghts. They'll find me and kill all of you. I must leave by dawn. You won't manage to ride. I'll give you a wagon... my sons and some of my men. You need all your men here. And Ziemowit, Piast's son stands for ten warriors. I'll escort you. - Where and when is the assembly? - As in the past, in the old oak grove... before Kupala's Feast when people flock to celebrate. I shall recover by then. That's for you. For the journey. And that. Make an offering to the Gods. Let them protect us. I'll have a matter to you. - Speak. - Not now. I'll come back. I'll be glad to see you. Away! Go away! Go! Where... are they? Who? The mice. - The mice? - They chased me... I tried to flee, but I couldn't. They caught up with me... I fell... They mice crept all over me. They got into my eyes... ...into my mouth... They were eating me alive! You drink too much! The prophecy mentioned mice. Mice play when the cat is away. You're sleeping, and the Guardian disappeared without a trace! They didn't come back? Wisz is sending out word. Sending out word? An assembly? How dare he! Dreaming of old privileges! You're asleep, nitwit? They could slaughter all of us. Take the most loyal men. None of the peasants' sons. - Bring me Wisz's head! - And if I meet the Guardian? You'll bring two heads. A quarter of the loot goes to me... ...for chosing your warriors. - A lot. A lot, you say? Wisz is a rich peasant. I can always summon other men. We're leaving at daybreak. - What? - Hush! - They'll attack your Father. - Who? Smerda. At dawn! Did you hear that? Some big fish. A pike. They don't expect anything. Open the gate! I wish you well... ...though you serve a felon. Go away! Seize him! Remember the mother, avenge the father. - Blood for blood. - Blood for blood. I'm with you. I want to be your brother. - Accept me. - Father died for the peasants. - They should call for revenge. - I'll avenge him with my sword. - You'll have a brother in me. - And you'll have brethern in us. There was no time to ask Wisz. Now you're the elder. I want to marry your sister. The younger one? She's not meant for weavning and childbearing, but for the sacred fire and divination. Chosen by the Gods. Girls dream about such fate, until they savor married life. I love her. Father vowed that if her mother survived the delivery... he'd offer the child to the Gods. Now, her parents are yonder. I do not wish to offend the spirits or the Gods. I'd be glad to oblige, but I can't. You prefer an enemy to a brother? When you need friends, not foes? I can't. I'll take her by force. And we'll defend her with force. - I vow by the Sun... - I vow by the Sun... - I vow by the Sun... - I vow by the Sun... ...to conform to and obey... ...whatever the assembly decides... ...even if it were against my will. He who summoned us died, but his spirit is here - and demands revenge. - Father's blood calls for revenge! The law says: Death for death. Death for death! Who was the killer? Smerda. - Kill Smerda! - He followed the Prince's orders. And if he killed of his own will? - Then the Prince is innocent! - He is guilty! - He's innocent! Wisz summoned you here... ...to judge a felon. The Prince slaughtered all of his kin. Who saw it? I did! I saw the corpses! They died in a fight for power. A sword doesn't turn the flesh blue... ...or makes the mouth foam. It doesn't kill dogs. He maimed the bodies to hide the signs of poisoning. A crime unpunished gives birth to another crime! - What say you? - Death. Death! Death! Death! Death! Death. - Death. - Name... ...your commander! Our tribe is the largest. We're giving the most men. Bumir! Let the strongest lead! Giant for the commander! Our tribe is the oldest. Let Dzikowic command! And what about us? Are we worse? Choose whomever you want! But choose a leader. What for? We'll attack in a mass! Yes, that's right! In a mass! Ten heads are better than one. - Let's do it! - And the harvest? Harvest first. War after the harvest! - He's right! - After the harvest! Strike on Kupala's Feast. They'll be drunk and unarmed. No warrior will dare to fight that night! - They won't defend the fortress? - My men will. - Kill the peasants' sons! - Call the Vikings. - They'll wreck havoc. - Good! - Peasants will seek your protection. - The Saxons are nearer. A Viking loots and leaves. But a Saxon? Once he sit down his iron-clad butt... You'll be a great ruler, son. Greater than your father. We're safe until the harvest. There's time to summon the Vikings. When the boys get drunk and wild... ...they might mistake me for a girl. Some could try to steal a kiss! Go back home. Leave the feast! Go home. If you stay blood will flow! - You're insane! - Insane! Insane! You know... once, I was beautiful too. But tears washed the charm away. I'm insane! - I love you! - No! - You love me! - No! Mila! Fetch the beer! She'll waste away in the shrine. I haven't sent for you. Not yet. I killed someone. I betrayed the Gods by falling in love. You killed? I was the cause of my parents' death. He kidnapped me, I struggled! With whom? Whom did you kill? Ziemowit... Piast's son. Oh, Gods! Ziemowit slain by a girl's hand? Lmpossible. The prophecy can't be wrong. I'll keep watch over the holy fire. You are too young. Please, let me. All right. But this will be only a trial. She killed... - Ziemowit, Piast's son. - Ziemowit? Lmpossible. Leave your horse here, sir. There is an underwater passage. Dark forces... ...evil spirits, flee away! Flee! Flee... flee away... Fever... ...go beyond swamps. Fever... ...go beyond forests! He fell asleep... I did my job... - Unless someone casts a spell... - Water... I wish I had some live water... But where to find it? Beyond the hills and far away... Far, far away... A wild boar attacked me. It must have been a really huge one. Shame and disgrace! Stabbed by a girl... A laughing-stock. Even old wives will laugh... until I get her. - She's in the shrine. - I'll kidnap her from anywhere. Insulting the Gods and people. I don't care. I wanted to become her brothers' brother... ...to avenge their father's death... They refused to give her. - And the fortress? - What about it? They decided to attack Popiel. The assembly is the tribe's voice. Popiel is not my concern. - You didn't like living with Vikings? - I did. - So what drove you back? - If I only knew... A longing. A longing? I missed the forest. Forests are everywhere. But they smell different. Go back to the Vikings. Why should I? Join the Vikings... or the Saxons... or Russians. You're a brave warrior. They'll welcome you and pay well. Why should I go? If Popiel is no concern of yours, then neither are we or this land. Go away... ...and never come back. Their decision to wait has filled our granary. They're late. The peasants? - The Vikings. - Pity I sent for them. That filthy mob won't even dare... And yet. Light the stake! Let them know I do not fear them. Wait till they come nearer! Wait! Strong walls. - How to get past? - Attack the gate. The gate is well guarded. We need ladders. Ladders? Lmagine me on a ladder! There are relatives of ours on the other side! - They won't fight their own kin! - My two sons! And mine! Nielub! Open the gate! - You'd be useful there now. - Sure! Come out to us! Gniewko, Wramot, Nielub, Bolko! Bow to your fathers! Stop! Stop! Now! Turn back! Back! Learn. Burn the bridge! Damn you! You and your kin shall die! - You'll start eating your own shit! - We will starve you to death! Surround the fortress with guards! Watch the lake and the woods! Who do you think you are, smart-ass? We know what to do. Each of us has... ...his own deals to settle here. And you? You're not one of us! Go away, before someone thinks you are in Popiel's service! Leave! Leave! Away with you! Go away! Careful! Careful! Or the blood will rush. - May I rest here? - Be our guest. - You're going to the shrine? - Yes. - But I see you're not too well. - Give me some water. Mila! Don't you see that our guest is weary? Wounded in a battle? - In the woods, by a boar. - I thought you had been at the fortress. Will you put us up for the night? Take in a guest, take in the Gods. - Why are you staring at him? - He looked at me, too. A rich man. But I wouldn't call him a jug-maker. He seems a jug-breaker to me. Vanish, ghost! I'm not a ghost. I'm alive. I'm alive. Touch me if you don't believe that. I haven't killed you! You regret that? You came to kill me? Don't do it here. I'm not seeking revenge. - I wanted to see you. - I had to defend myself. I was promised to the Gods by my father. I won't forbid you to make offerings... ...and talk to the spirits at the sacred stone. The spirits are jealous like people. You can't serve both people and the Gods. I love you. I'll kidnap you, risking your stabbing me. Please, go, and don't come back. And if I do come back? Kill me! Kill me! Don't you dare kidnap her! - Father Wizun! - Be a man! - Should I take revenge? - Gain fame at war, not in wedlock! - Jarucha, you know everything. - I do, I do. I know you have the hots! Pour me some. Jarucha likes her mead. Give me some love potion. What? You're the best love potion. Give me the love potion! For him? A love potion is too weak. We need some magic. Honey, honey, sacred honey. Honey, honey, sacred honey. Oh, goddess of love! Let your lips taste sweet to him. Let your breasts taste sweet to him. Let your womb taste sweet to him. Let him stick to you like this grain does... Soon we'll see some horses! Give it to him looking straight into his eyes. Don't blink! He'll be yours. But if you blink, forget about him. - Thank you for your hospitality. - You're welcome. Have a good trip. Let the Gods guide you. A farewell drink. Run! Run! Save my child! Wild beasts are better than people! Into the woods! Jarucha! Into the woods! My beloved... To a good beginning! To Odin! - Haven't I seen you before? - You have, Jarl Sivald. You sailed with me. Untie him! - Join us. - You assaulted us. You used to plunder, too. With us. Despite your promise! I'm sorry, but your Prince invited us. - Popiel. - Yes, Poppel. - What are they talking about? - None of your business, dwarf. Join us or leave. I have the right to seek revenge. No doubt. But don't try. It'd be a waste of your life. Mysterious are the ways of the Gods. Run! Run for your life! People! That's the Gods' wrath! Punishment for raising against the Prince! If we'd been loyal, he'd defend us against the Vikings! Go to the Prince and beg him forgiveness! He will come to our defence! Let us appease the Gods! True! That's the Gods' wrath... ...for your brawling... ...and stupidity! Go ahead, bow to him. Beg him for mercy. Him, the butcher of your kin and of your sons! The traitor who brought the Vikings! What will you say... ...up yonder... when your turn comes to face the spirits of our ancestors? There is your commander. Obey him! - He will lead you. - The Guardian! The Guardian is our commander! Choose your decurions and centurions. Not according to their tribal ranks... ...but to their skills as warriors! Son of Piast... ...approach. When my voice becomes weak... ...heed to Ziemowit, Piast's son. He's young... ...but no stranger to battle. Make an oath... ...by the Sun! By the Sun! Without horses we can't catch up with the Vikings. We'll wait for them halfway, instead. *Thor took their minds away! *They didn't burn the boats! *They still can do it. Odin! Surrender! Or you shall all perish! For each of our lives you'll pay with ten! We can't afford to lose men. We still must fight Popiel. Let the Gods decide! Jarl is calling the bravest one... ...to stand up against him! If Jarl falls... ...you'll take our swords. If your man is killed, we'll sail away. What? No volunteers? You want to win with cunning only? Men with hares' hearts! Me. Swear by the Sun that you'll keep your word. Swear by Odin that you won't come back here. - By the Sun. - By the Sun! Drop you weapons! You have sworn... ...by Odin! We swore to give you our swords. They'd been like a pack of wolves, but they died like true warriors. Let their spirits sail away to Valhalla. They want more? Call the Saxons. - Did you hear? - Yes, my Lady. You dirty bastards! Want some more? Come on, then, don't be shy! You stinking cowards! Time for a bleeding! Will you order to strike? No. Just surround the fortress. Don't let anybody sneak through the walls. He tried to sneak through. We found this on him. Popiel's emblem. - I saw him with the Vikings. - What are your orders? Speak! - Speak, you weasel! - The Saxons! I am to fetch the Saxons! Enough. Let him go. What? Let them know nobody will help them. You dirty bastards! Stinking cowards! Die, peasants! Kill them! Kill them! Death to the peasants! Why don't you order to strike? - A lot of men will perish. - War is war. You want a victory that no one will celebrate? What do you see there? A tower. And some pigeons. Pigeons always return home. Grain... Spill grain! Forgive us, Gods, for sacrifing birds to save people. Let them fly! Brilliant idea. A Russian princess used it against rebels. - You know a lot. - Let's go! To the keep! Everyone into the keep! There! - What now? - We'll summon the Saxons. - They stopped Znosek. - We'll send another. We're safe! The granary is full! We can fight back for a long time! - How long? - Very long. Too many mouths to feed, too few hands to bear weapons! - They're getting rid of the useless. - They won't leave the keep. - Mama, I'm hungry! - Wait! - But I want some food! - In a moment! Open the granary, run the mills! Mama, I'm cold! Lousy bastards! You can't burn the tower! We have plenty of food! Don't come closer to the tower! Don't waste your arrows! We're out of grain. - What? - We have no grain. - Mice. - Mice, sir. Mice! Mice! His head will pay for our lives. Gods... ...I curse... I curse you! You've seen the Gods' wrath! The prophecy came true! A man can't live without his head... ...the bees without their queen. Yesterday came the Vikings... ...tomorrow it'll be the Saxons! Elect... the new Prince! The Guardian! The Guardian! The Guardian! I'm old! I have no son and will not have one. Who'll be my successor? More assemblies, more quarrels? There is someone... ...that many of you here... ...owe their lives to! Ziemowit! Glory! Do you... still wish to run off with her? Yes. If you appease the Gods, they'll forgive you. Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! And they lived happily ever after. Ziemowit succeeded the Guardian on the throne. Then, his son, Leszek, followed by the grandson Ziemomysl... ...and the great grandson Mieszko, who cut down the sacred oaks... ...overthrew the Gods of old... ...and taught his fellow Polans to worship Jesus Christ. ...and taught his fellow Polans to worship Jesus Christ.
