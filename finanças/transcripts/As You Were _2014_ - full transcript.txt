Lock your elbows. Watch it, and stop! You'll be confined until investigations are over. Bring him to the room. For the rest of you, if you think I don't know what is going on, you're messing with the wrong person. The next person that fucks around with me will not just be confined. Is that clear? Yes sir! Squad, attention! Fall out! Sit. Do you know why you're here? Captain Tan thinks I need counseling? The two of you are good friends right? You seemed to enjoy confinement. I can send you back to your cell and be done with it. Because we're all… sick. Sick of living in this chicken coop. We eat together, sleep together, shower together, shit together. Okay, let's talk. I always see you playing basketball by yourself. Is it so difficult to get along with your peers? Why are you so quiet? Since you're such a loner, you must have liked living here. Might as well live here for the rest of your life. You're given food and a roof over your head; it is quiet and the weather is nice. What else can you ask for? This is like a paradise. Everything is relative. Some people believe that a uniform group instills discipline. Others see it as mere monotony. It's been a while since I came to this island. It is by no means a small island, but I've gotten to know it well. There is a field here where we can look out to the mainland. The mainland – a dazzling metropolis of skyscrapers. The mainland never stops changing. It can't let itself stop changing. The new quickly becomes old. The old is quickly replaced by the new. And so we build and demolish, demolish and build again. Forever and always, ceasingly changing. As my eyes travel across to the mainland, someone there becomes a captive of my gaze. And if she looks towards me too, I will become an exile. This is a beautiful photograph. - Which one? - This one. - Where did you take it? - MBS. When MBS wasn't built yet, I often go there… It's just an impulsive feeling. I go there to see the sunset everyday after school. The colors are beautiful. Which Chinese character 'Pei' is in your name? The same 'Pei' as the Chinese character in 'admire'. The 'Ling' in 'Qiao Ling'? It's the character with 'Wang' on the side. That's right. Actually I always wanted to ask you… Who is Qiao Ling? Qiao Ling might be a fictional character, or she might be a real person. Am I supposed to make my own interpretation? This book is for you. - Thank you. - Don't mention it. The Sky I wish to share with Peiling You used many different stamps in this book. There are the fish series and the floral series. I also went to different countries… like Hong Kong and Malaysia, and I stole their postcards. Some of the photographs were not taken by me. I remember collecting stamps in my childhood. I collected many of these floral stamps. Do you like flowers? Yes. I remember as a child, I will cut out the part of the envelopes with stamps and soak them in water, and when the stamps detach from the envelope, I will hang them on windowpanes. I rarely collect stamps these days… I can't even find my old stamps anymore. In this book, I really like… this text that was written by my friend Fang Wei. He wrote: the day will come when everyone around us forgets the feeling of holding a printed photograph. As we grow up, our childhood photographs also age with us. I think it is very meaningful. It is like how people change over time. Time will change and transform people, and feelings fade away. Han got me to translate his new book. So he sent me a copy. I found the dedication on the front page very interesting. It casually binds the reader to the book. We might see the same sky now, but do we see the same sky in our past? Come inside the pool and tread water. Take off your top and throw it into the pool. Take off your bottom and make a float. How do you make a float? Firstly… Go under all the way. Take out your hand. Your float is so big. It looks like Mickey Mouse. None of your business. Do it again, until it's big and taut. Do you remember where are the stamps we used to collect? I was looking for them yesterday. What stamps? The ones we collected in primary school. Oh, those stamps… Retard. Why are you looking for them? It's not like you have letters to send. Don't bother. You always don't finish your sentences, and blame me for misunderstanding you. It's no use telling you now that the stamps are lost. An old item like this should be at Grandmother's place. I don't know... Yesterday I met Han, a photographer. There are many postcards in his photo book, and he used a variety of different stamps. They reminded me of the stamps we used to collect. I wanted to see them again. It's only stamps, what's so different? They're different. Stamps feel different when holding them in your hands. You won't understand. Han is having an exhibition at the Art Museum. It is opening next week. Do we have to go? Up to you. From the moment you left to the moment you unexpectedly showed up again, I'd always thought that if we had kept in touch, perhaps we wouldn't be so distant today. Perhaps we could've still constructed a present together. I imagine us seeing each other grow, knowing how each other has changed. But we, too familiar with the past, have laid traps of silence for ourselves. We didn't know that we have both changed. We try to isolate change, swimming from the mainland to the other shore. Shall we turn back? The tide is getting higher. We can still continue. Why did the tide rise so fast? I don't remember it being like this. You're funny, isn't the tide always the same? Watch out. What's wrong? Nothing. Tell me if you're unhappy, don't just look glum. You brought work to do? I have no choice, there's a deadline to meet. When is it? The day after tomorrow. If that's the case… I'll go back to camp. Let's go to the meadows in the evening? What meadows? Where we went the other time. You said you like that place. Did I? If you just say meadows, I won't know where you're referring. There are meadows everywhere. The one where you can see the city. You should've said so earlier. Okay, I got to go. Everyone, let's begin our lesson. Guohui. What did Peiling do? Peiling talked in class. Peiling talked in class… are you sure? Okay, Peiling go stand at the door. Teacher, Peiling did not talk in class. It's the boys who maligned her. Don't forget to memorize the dictation passage. Okay, can you see the next line? What's with that look? I was here just now. - But you went to the canteen to buy food. - I don't care, I was here earlier. Can you see the line above? I can't read. Okay, read the line. Next line. Pay attention. Do it again. Where's Miss Lim? Guohui fell down in the field. He's injured. I'll go look for Miss Lim. All of you move away. Stop moving around! - You're a big boy yet you're afraid of pain. - No! If man is burdened by worries for the future, Spring will go… Spring will go and Autumn will come, and we will grow old. At dawn we see the rivers flow to the east, in the dusk we see the sun set in the west… How many tomorrows are there in a hundred years? Dear friend, do listen to my Song of Tomorrow. Are you okay? I'll get you a glass of water. Together we progress onwards, clever at seeking knowledge. Take care of your health, and be courteous to your friends. With a heart that is clean and pure, together we respect and do good. Watch your behavior, oh youths. Guohui! Guohui we're here. Why are you late? I'm on duty today. Very responsible. Do you do your duties? Of course not. By the way, we plan to sabotage Peiling tomorrow. Are you in? - Don't ask him. You know he's close to her. - No I'm not! So you're in with us? Sorry, I cannot help you. Told you. Don't make things difficult for me! I'm the monitor. Your buddy was bullied today and you never helped. But it's not her fault! Then whose fault is it? I kept many envelopes for you. You stopped collecting stamps for some time. Guohui Guobin, it's time to go home. Come on, Daddy's waiting outside. Mom, we're making a move. Say goodbye to Grandma. Bye Grandma. Hey! There're fireworks! But it's showing on the television. Guobin! Come quickly! You gave me a scare… disappearing like that. I couldn't sleep. You could've woken me up, I can come with you. Sometimes, I just need to be alone you know. Guohui… Nothing. Let me try. It's okay. It's just a lantern, I can always make a new one. Peiling let's go! Okay, that's the cue. On top of that, also send me a visual signal. Okay, sure. We're not opened yet. Is it okay if I just wait around? Should be fine. We open at seven. We're just doing sound checks, so hang out if you like. Try the theme. Okay. Can you bring brushes later? I need to finish these words, go smoke first? Hey. Japanese? Yes. I tried studying that for a while, but… I'm just really bad at it. Do you speak any other languages? Just Japanese, and a little bit of French. But only a little. You totally seem like a linguist. I'm a translator. Cool. Are you waiting for your boyfriend? Sorry, that was probably a bit personal. No it's fine, I'm just waiting for some friends. Okay. We'll be doing a couple of sets, see you later? Here is now and here is free, breathing, watching, waiting, wanting. Deep and still and time to see, things that are over, things that begin. We always seem to fool ourselves to see only what we want to see. Imagine what we'd be if we saw the things our bodies know… That last song… it's new right? It's not really complete yet, I just started working on it today. Do you like it? It's very nice. It's very sweet of you. I'm going away actually. Where to? If I tell you, I'll have to kill you. I heard you left Alan. That was fast. I think that you probably heard everything you need to. Perhaps. Uncle, how old were you when you got married? I'm not married. Last time I had a girlfriend from the village on Lazarus Island. She's a very nice girl, we used to go out. But nothing happened. The village is also gone now. Your water springs from solo… Your water flows faraway, until it reached the sea. That boat, your tale from the past. The merchants and traders always crossed you on that boat. Do you want to sit down? - Here. - Thanks. I'll be back in a second. You who are beautiful, you who are sweet, you who are so delicate. Always shy, you are sensitive and emotional, behind that critical façade. Hidden in your mystery, like a curtain of mist, both of your hands are hidden, behind your back. Honey in your right hand, poison in your left hand. I don't know which you will offer to me. I don't know which you will offer to me. I don't know which you will offer to me. Do you know I love fires? When I was a kid I used to take these big metal bowls, and I put a bunch of satay sticks and paper inside and light it. I just watched while it burns. My mother wasn't very happy about it. I stopped after destroying one of the bowls. It turned black. I will remove the cover, let me know if you can see clearly. How about this? I can see clearly. You can see the last row right? Can you see the red NF now? How about the green EX? Yes I can see both. Which one is clearer, NF or EX? They're the same. I can see both clearly. Let's go outside and look at faraway things. I saw you many years after. In the vast sea of words, it took me a while to find your name. Those two words that made me feel so close to you then. Those times when we were still curious about each other. We threw caution to the wind, and fell in love with that sense of familiarity. But how do we create new memories now? After all, we have relied too much on our past. Do you remember him? Do you remember that place? Without our childhood, what else would we share? What else would we love? The stamp album is long gone. Together we progress onward, clever at seeking knowledge. Take care of your health and be courteous to your friends. With a heart that is clean and pure, together we respect and do good. Watch your behaviour, oh youths. Customs and cultures, hold them high. Quickly reach your ambitions, oh youths. So that we'll have our worth, in the eyes of the world. If we are lazy and forgetful, our lives are for nothing. A good soul, a healthy and fresh mind. Hard work and patience, definitely brings happiness. Soft-spoken is the lady, energetic and tenacious is the man. Charitable, always contributing, protecting and giving service. Attain a respectable position, oh youths. Be hardworking so that you will succeed, may you achieve happiness.
