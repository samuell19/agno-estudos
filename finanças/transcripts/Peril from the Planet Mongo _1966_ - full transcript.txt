Standby to land. Narrator: Alerted by Prince Barin that Ming the Merciless is again threatening the safety of Earth, Flash and his friends have returned to Planet Mongo to prevent Ming from carrying out his mad ambition to destroy the Earth and conquer the universe. - It's Barin. - Flash! - Barin, I'm glad to see you. - How are you? - Barin! - Zarkov! Dale! - Hello, Barin. Oh, this is a happy day. - Glad to see you. - It's been a long time. I rushed from the palace as soon as your rocket ship was described. Receiving us with drawn bows. - And, Aura, is she well? - Yes, and very happy. Come on, see for yourselves when she was returns from the hunt. It's taken you a long time to fashion six zontranillium projectiles. All work has to be done in complete vacuum, sire. The smallest amount of oxygen touching that metal would have ignited it and burned us alive. Your Majesty means to attack the Earth at once? We'll first test the projectiles on Prince Barin's kingdom of Arboria. Arboria, sire? The Arborian forest is the source of all the fine timber in Mongo. - One projectile dropped-- - Yes, yes, yes. I understand. I understand. The projectile will only be dropped on the barren sections of Arboria. The prince will have warning to watch their effect and contemplate what will happen in case I direct them against his palace. Your pardon, sire, but surely you don't mean to destroy Arboria? Why the Princess Aura, your daughter, is there. My errant daughter deserves no consideration. However, I suppose she must be removed. You're keeping secret communication with my daughter's attendant Lady Sonja? Yes, sire, by means of the birds. Good. I'll give you a message for her. I hope Your Highness will pardon the delay. Of course, but for you, Sonja, neither Prince Barin nor myself would have realized the dire needs of some of our tenants. Everything is in readiness, Your Highness. Whom are we to call on today, Sonja? If it please Your Highness, a poor family of woodcutters. They live in the Red Forest. Then it's off to the Red Forest we go. Inform Her Highness I returned safely with our guests. Her Highness went to the Red Forest some hours ago to visit a poor tenant in distress. Lady Sonja and Captain Turan accompanied her. Very well, let me know the moment she returns. Yes, Your Majesty. Keedish, my head scientist. His knowledge is fairly extensive in the field of rare metals. Is there something I can do to aid Your Highness? Yes, Keedish. Ming is threatening the planet Earth with a new weapon. The Earth people here are anxious to uncover all they can concerning it. Well, I have other matters to attend to, so I'll leave you here. Thank you, Barin. Tell me, sir, what do you know of zontranillium? Zontranillium, sometimes called the fire metal. Traces of it have been found with a spectroscope on some of the dead suns of the polar galaxy. Tell me, what are some of its outstanding reactions? When exposed to oxygen, this metal burns with the heat of the sun. Do you know of any way of extinguishing the fire once the metal starts burning? Nothing will put it out, sir, but you have no cause for alarm. There's no zontranillium to be found on Mongo. You're wrong. Ming possess a formula for making unlimited quantities of it. And he plans to fire huge projectiles of it into the Earth. The planet Earth would be burned to ashes. Not only that, but enough of it would burn all of the oxygen out of the atmosphere. There must be some defense against it. - We know of none. - Then we must find one. Assemble all the thermal electronic apparatuses you have. We must prepare at once for an exhaustive experimentation. I wonder if we should have come, Sonja. You know, Prince Barin and his friends are on a dangerous mission. I think I should have stayed at the castle. Your Highness becomes too domesticated. If men will go and fight, there's no reason why we should mope at home. If this machine proves my theory of-- Flash! Zarkov! Look here! This radio message from Emperor Ming was just handed to me. "Prince Barin, we presently will have a demonstration of the means at my command to punish your allegiance to my enemies the Earthmen. When you see your wastelands burn, think what will happen to your castle and your forest." He means to use zontranillium, the fire metal, against Arboria. How long before you can complete your defense, doctor? I don't know. Thanks to the years spent by Professor Karm in developing his contrathermal defense theory, I can complete the machine to dispense it in a day-- perhaps two. At least two. It's be enough time, doctor. I know my crafty father-in-law. He's bluffing. He wouldn't dare attack Arboria while his daughter is here. Your Highness! Prince Barin! Your Highness! The Princess Aura has just been abducted by soldiers of Ming. The lady Sonja led us into an ambush. I did what I could, but-- A physician at once! Go ahead with the contrathermal machine, doctor. Don't worry, Barin. We'll help you and Aura out of this mess somehow. I demand to know why I am being held prisoner. When you and your husband Prince Barin chose to ally yourself with the Earthmen, you became my enemies, and must take the consequences. You dare to tamper with my attendants? To send this slinking cat Sonja to worm her way into my confidence? And you, Captain Torch, you bloody-handed murderer, to lay hands upon royalty? Mark my words, you two shall pay for this when Prince Barin and Flash Gordon-- Sire, we have intercepted a radio message from Prince Barin to his patrol ships. Yes? "All patrol ships, the Emperor Ming is about to attempt destruction of Arboria by means of fiery projectiles. Dr. Zarkov has devised means of counteracting this murderous attack. Inform me at once location of any of these projectiles and steps will be taken to extinguish fire. Signed, Barin." There's the answer to your threats. The Earthmen have beaten you once. They'll beat you again. Take her to the women's quarters! - Sonja, Torch. - Sire. Your Majesty. You have done well and will be rewarded. But I have another task for you. We are ready, sire. Whatever means Zarkov has of extinguishing our projectiles must be carried to the spot of conflagration. Information as to location must come from Barin's laboratory. Now you're to proceed at once to Arboria, destroy Prince Barin's radio station, thus preventing these messages from being sent. It shall be done, sire. Now listen, Flash, and get this clear, for all our lives may depend upon it. You know I've got to stay here and direct you where the projectiles fall. Go ahead, doctor. By turning this dial, you will envelope your ship with contrathermal waves that'll protect you from the extreme heat. I see. One of these units must be placed by you close to Ming's projectile when it falls. They'll understand how to protect you while you accomplish this. - Ronal will run the ship. - Thank you, sir. We'll go and get ready, Zarkov. All right, men, get these instruments down to the ship. Flash Gordon calling Prince Barin. It is probable Ming is aware of what we're doing and will attempt to prevent us any word to Flash. I have anticipated that, Your Highness. Patrol ships are in the vicinity and will attack any Ming ship that approaches. Flash Gordon calling Prince Barin. Flash Gordon calling Prince Barin. Yes, Flash? We're over the Cauldron Wastelands, Barin, ready for action. No sign of enemy activity. Maintain your present circuit. Dr. Zarkov will give you the exact information the moment the projectile strikes. Good. We'll be ready. Prepare the first projectile. The projectile is ready to be fired, Your Majesty. Has the range been calculated? Yes, sire. The dial readings are 16, 44, 336. We'll alter the range every 20 minutes. We'll show those who dared to balk me in my determination to conquer the universe. ( projectile shrieks ) What's that? Oh, Flash, it's terrible. Ming's first messenger of death. There. One has already struck. Locate the exact point where it fell. I'll get Flash. Yes, doctor, we saw it and felt it pass. I got it. 30 miles due west from here. First projectile 30 miles due west from here. Change your course accordingly. Yes, sir. I'll get the firesuit. Flash: We're getting close. I'll turn on the contrathermal waves. It's no use, Flash, you can't live in this heat. After all, this wasteland's of no value. Unless that blaze is extinguished, it'll burn up all the oxygen in the air, strangle thousands of people, Ronal. - I know you can do it, Flash. - That's a good girl. It works! The contrathermal ray is protecting him. He's done it! It's failed! It's failed! He'll be killed! We've overloaded and burned out a connection. He's alive. He's alive! He's coming back. Oh, no! No, Ronal, you can't let him go out again. Wait, Flash. Oh, he's done it, Ronal. He put that one out of commission. I'll get Zarkov. Calling Prince Barin's palace. Calling Prince Barin's palace. Oh, Flash. Calling Prince Barin's palace. Calling Prince Barin's palace. Dr. Zarkov calling Flash Gordon. Dr. Zarkov answering Flash Gordon. Hello, Zarkov. Your contrathermal is a success, sir. We've extinguished the projectile. Let us know where any more of the projectiles fall. It works perfectly. We still have two more units. That's splendid, Flash. Two more projectiles have fallen. The locations are-- Zarkov! Dr. Zarkov! There was an explosion. The connection's gone. Zarkov! Your Highness, a Ming bomber is over the palace. Patrols will take care of it. They've been warned. I'll have this repaired in a moment, Your Highness, if that bomber doesn't score another bull's-eye. You made a direct hit, Thong, close to the wall of the laboratory. I could see the flash when the bomb struck. There's one of Barin's ships coming! Two more coming in from above. They're surrounding us! Zarkov speaking. Yes, sir. Yes, go ahead, doctor. One of Ming's ships have bombed us. The patrols have driven it off. Good. Now tell us where those projectiles have fallen. One of the projectiles fell about 30 miles west of... Aah! We're going to crash! I want to make it look like a crash so they won't follow us down. A clear hit, Raj. The last shot finished them. Calling Prince Barin's castle. Calling Prince Barin's castle. Enemy ship met and destroyed. That is all. Thong, get our location. Captain Torch calling Emperor Ming. Captain Torch calling Emperor Ming. This is the palace of the Emperor. This is Captain Torch speaking from Arboria. This is of vital importance. Wait, Captain Torch. Inform His Majesty that Captain Torch is calling from Arboria. My plan is failing. The projectiles are being extinguished as soon as they strike. Your Majesty must remember that Dr. Zarkov is there. The doctor's a clever man. He may have discovered some means of defense against it. The counteracting force is known only to myself. And you-- you knew and you were alone in my laboratory with Dr. Zarkov before he escaped. If you have dared betray any of my secrets to him, I'll-- Captain Torch is calling from Arboria, Your Majesty. - Get Arboria. - Yes, sire. Yes, Your Majesty. We bombed Prince Barin's power plant, but were attacked and forced to land. You have failed. Zarkov is extinguishing our projectiles as fast as they land. But your Majesty, we dropped the bombs directly! Get into Prince Barin's castle by anyway that you can devise. Learn what their plans are and report to me. The lives of all of you are staked upon this venture. There's no need of all of us going. The ship has to be repaired before we can make our escape. That's right. I can repair the damage while you go to the castle. And you believe this instrument would be effective in an attack upon me? Unquestionably. The difficulty is that in launching its neutralizing cartridge, the gun destroys itself. And the explosion releases a poisonous gas that will destroy all life over a wide area. - Oh, but-- - Of course, it will have to be operated by a fuse. Flash, Flash! I just caught part of the message from Ming on this short wave set. From Ming? Well, I'm sure it was the voice of Ming. But I caught only a few words. He said, "The lives of all of you are staked upon this venture." I waited, but he said nothing more. Do you think it means that we're to be attacked? They'll know you. Of course, but I can hold his attention for a moment. All right, keep his back to me. It's necessary that I have audience with Prince Barin at once. I will explain everything to His Highness. - Let me pass. - You will go as my prisoner. Yes, the prince will see you. If I am not mistaken, he'll have you hanged from the highest turret for the abduction of Princess Aura. Quick! If Ming is planning an attack, our best defense is to beat him to the punch. Ming must be keeping a strict guard over Aura or she would have communicated with us before now. I'll have a ship made ready for the journey. There's something about this gun destroying itself that I don't understand. The Emperor will be unable to put his spaceships into the air, nor to maintain contact with those already there. His water supply will be in danger-- Put up your hands! Both of you. What does this mean? - You shall be reported! - Just a moment, professor. This is Captain Torch. You have good eyes. Now, stand aside while I destroy that deadly machine. No, no, you shall not destroy it! Suit yourself. You first and then the machine. Your Highness wishes to see me? I will not stand on ceremony, Father. I demand my instant release and return to Prince Barin's domain. As Barin entertains my enemies the Earthmen, he too becomes my enemy, and you a hostage. Unless you release me at once, Father, Flash Gordon and Dr. Zarkov will return here and pull you from your throne as they did once before. As they did once before. Yet I still survive, still rule the universe, while they... - Yes, while they? ...are at this moment headed for certain destruction in a trap that I have prepared for them. The audience is at an end, Your Highness. What is your plan to rescue Princess Aura? Well, it's a risky one at best, and may not succeed, so I'm not asking you to endanger yourselves. You don't have to ask us. We're all in this together. Thank you. Well, what are your orders? We'll attempt to enter the dungeon caverns under the palace. Captain Sudan of the Ming guard is still loyal to me, and with his aide I hope to find my wife and rescue her. Perhaps we can get in touch with him over this radio phone Zarkov made. Karm has one like it and is probably waiting for a message from us. - I'll try it. - Oh, that's an excellent idea. Hello. Hello. Our only chance to communicate with Flash and the others is by that radio phone. Where is it? It was left in the laboratory where they arrested me. Oh, Captain Sudan knows where-- behind that meter he set in the old hiding place. I can get it from the laboratory if Captain Sudan will help me. I will, your Highness. Then do so. It's long past the time that Flash promised to call me. Flash Gordon calling emergency. Perhaps something has happened to Karm. I trust not. Keep calling in the chance he'll answer. - Hello? - We found it. Flash: Calling emergency. Gordon is calling me. Yes, Flash, this is emergency. Listen carefully. They've made me a prisoner, but Captain Sudan is helping me. Listen, can you get a message to Princess Aura? She's here now. What do you wish to tell her? I'll let Barin do it. Here, Barin. My dear, are you all right? - Yes, darling, I'm all right. Good. Tonight we'll take you away. Let me speak to the captain. Captain? We land near the dungeon caverns at midnight. Can you open the gates for us? Yes, your Highness. I will be on duty in the control room. Make certain you do not fail, and have available such members of the guard as you can trust. I will, sire, but we must go now. It is not safe to talk longer. It's about time those gates were opening. Sudan will do his part as he can. Suppose he can't? Inside, quickly. ( clanking ) Palace guards coming this way. Perhaps Captain Sudan sent them. No, no, they're not of our party. If they ever see us, they'll give an alarm. We'll jump them when they come through that arch. Hide. What's happened? Their presence has been discovered. What can we do? Nothing but hope for the best. I still may be-- What's the meaning of this alarm? I do not know, Your Majesty. It startled me. It's your duty to find out. They're all there, all except Dale Arden, caught like rats in a trap. Open the flood control valves. But, Your Majesty, you wanted them captured alive. Are you going to obey? Run for your lives! That flume will fling us into a bottomless pit! Drowned like rats. I must tell Princess Aura about this interesting event. There's still a chance to save them. This will divert the water away from the bottomless pit, down into the ravine. That's done it. They were swept out through the side tunnel. Now they at least have a chance for their lives. Close it quickly. If Ming hears of this, we may meet a horrible death. Got to get out of here before Ming discovers his trap has failed. The ship is beyond that ridge! Carry him, Roka! Flash! Barin! You were discovered. Princess Aura, you didn't find her? No, we failed. Zarkov needs attention right away. Ronal, we've got to get away from here as quickly and quietly as we can. Ming doesn't know we escaped him. Hurry! A very clever device, Karm, but it will be of no further use to you. Your friends Flash Gordon and Dr. Zarkov were killed in an attempted attack upon my castle. And Barin, my husband? It is unfortunate that your husband chose to join the cause of my enemies. It is also unfortunate that I have to die before ridding the universe of your evil presence and placing the Princess Aura upon the throne! My daughter is no longer a princess. She's merely a prisoner of war. Do you hope to save your life for this bravado? No, Ming. I only hope to get close enough to put my hands on your throat! Too bad. Karm was a clever scientist. Take him away. ( beeping ) Someone calling on Karm's radio. My husband! He's calling Karm. Can you imitate Karm's voice? I can try, Your Majesty. Zarkov: Karm, are you alone? Zarkov to speak to you. Oh, they're alive. They're alive! Take her to the women's quarters. Oh, no! This is Karm. They failed to find my radio phone. I thought you and your people were drowned in the flooded caverns. Some miracle diverted the flood waters into the side tunnel into the ravine. That miracle was my daughter. A very clever girl, but she shall be punished. Karm, let us know when Ming means to attack, and in what manner. Ask him about Princess Aura. The Princess Aura is safe and well. The emperor believes you were all destroyed by the flood. He contemplates no other attack upon Arboria at present. I will know and give you plenty of warning if danger threatens. That's good news, Barin. It gives you time to call in your patrols and prepare the ships for defense. For attack, rather. I mean to take Princess Aura out of Ming's hands at any cost. I'll tell Flash. He and Dale are down at the cells. Well, you'd better come clean, Torch. How many ships has Ming got ready for immediate action? Just why should I tell you anything? Prince Barin would give a good deal for aid in bringing the princess home safely. Why not get help from you friend Karm? He's on the ground. It's too bad Thong escaped. - He'd have talked. - How did that happen? He pretended to be wounded worse than he was. The guards didn't watch him. Let's try Sonja. Maybe she'll think more of her neck. Sonja, we're gonna give you a chance for your life. - We want you to tell-- - Send her away, Earthman. You and I understand each other. All right, Dale. Release me, Flash Gordon, and I'll tell you everything. ( chuckles ) Oh, no. You're going to have to talk first. Then I'll see what I can do about getting you out. Remember, you're Prince Barin's prisoner, not mine. Prince Barin. Bah. He's as good as putty in your hands and will do anything you bid him. Set me free and I'll show you how to overthrow both Prince Barin and Emperor Ming. Then you and I, Earthman, will rule the universe. Flash. What is it, Roka? Dr. Zarkov wants to see you. He's been talking with Karm by radio, and he says there's no danger of an attack by Ming for some time. Oh, good. Thank you, Roka. Better watch that woman. She'll try to trick you. Thank you, sir. She's already tried. ( tapping continues ) ( screaming ) Well, it took you some time to get here. You found Sonja interesting? What's all this about a message from Karm? - He said that-- - Wait a minute, Zarkov. I want his exact words. How does he begin? His exact words? Why, I don't know. Roka talked to him first. He made the connection, then handed me the radio. Well, Roka? He said, "This is Karm. I'm alone in the laboratory." - Then it wasn't Karm who was speaking. - Not Karm? What do you mean? He said Princess Aura was safe! It couldn't have been Karm. We'd arranged code words to avoid this sort of trick. If it had been Karm, he would have begun with the words - "Listen carefully." - But it was Karm's voice. He said that Ming believed us dead. Dead? Then he knows we're alive. No doubt he's planning for immediate attack after sending that fake message of reassurance. Then I must instruct the outer patrol to be on the alert. Ship 41, 183rd vertical parallel. All well. Ship 41, 183rd vertical parallel. All well. Ship 17 now on patrol. All well. Ship 17 on her patrol. All well. Yes, Gordon? I have reason to believe that Ming plans to attack at once. Warn all ships to be on the alert. Tell them to report immediately, any spaceship, whatever marking. The order will go out immediately, sir. Thank you. Calling all spaceships. Calling all spaceships. General order number 83. General order number 83. Watch that door. Calling Emperor Ming. Calling the palace of Emperor Ming. This is Captain Torch speaking. I've got momentary control of Barin's radio room. - What are your orders, sire? - I will send gas bombers to attack Barin's palace at once. See if you can call in Barin's patrol ships, so there will be no warning of the attack. It shall be done, sire. Watch that door closely while I call in Barin's patrols. Calling all patrols. These are general orders from Prince Barin. All ships are to come in at once and ground for repairs. Ship number five acknowledging general order from Prince Barin. We're heading in at once. How long will it take Ming's fleet to get here? Not long, if I can clear the patrols out of their way. We're nearing Sonja's cell. Yes, I'd just like to get my hands on her. She's gone! Something's happened to the guard! He's dead. Killed by a raygun. Get Flash and call the guards. I'll sound an alarm from the radio room. What are you doing? I'm trying to break communication with Barin's ships so they can't countermand my orders. And you think Ming intends to attack? I'm so sure of it that I took the liberty of broadcasting an order to your patrol ship, Your Highness. Torch and Sonja have escaped. - Escaped? - Impossible! Scatter and search. This little job will prevent anyone from rescinding the order to call in the patrols. Why you little-- - I'm in the radio room! - Give me that! Flash! In the radio room! Help, Flash! In the radio room! Stay where you are, Gordon! Get away from that door, Gordon, or I'll pull the trigger. Move, quick. Don't let him get away, Flash. He's called in the patrols and Ming's about to attack! Sound the alarm! Quickly! ( alarm ) Roka, stand back. Guards! Get that radio repaired inside. Ming's fleet is coming! Warn the patrols! ( alarm continues ) - Can you open it? - No. There's a way to the roof back there. They're going into the tower stairs. You won't have a chance. Torch can blast you from there. Never mind! Follow him, but don't crowd him. He'll kill Dale. I'll head them off from the outside. Ming's bombers. The raid has begun. The Emperor's ships. They're dropping gas bombs. Get out on the roof. Maybe we can signal them. They can't see us! We'll be killed with the rest! Torch, look out! Poison gas. Cover your mouth. We must get to the laboratory and open the gas control valve. All right, men, gas masks. Ming said this would revive them. They look dead to me. - The gas control valves! - All open, Your Highness. The castle will be cleared of gas in just a few moments. The radio? Communications have been restored. I'll contact the patrols in a moment. Man: Mission noted and approved. Use your destructo ray. Open on them! Ship number five acknowledging general order from Prince Barin. Barin's patrol is attacking. One of our ships is down already. We'll make for the palace with our prisoners. Hope we can rescue Captain Torch. Ming would rather lose a dozen ships than his captain. Torch was captured by Flash Gordon. But the emperor will be compensated when he learns that we've brought Dale Arden back to him. I'd rather die than to fall into Ming's hand again. Another one of our ships is down. Full speed ahead to the palace. The enemy is beaten, Your Highness. Two of his ships shot down and the others driven off. Never mind that. Are there no reports of Flash and Dale? The search of the castle and grounds is continuing. - Flash! - Thank heavens, you're safe. Dale and Ronal are gone. Have you seen them? Torch here had Dale prisoner when I grabbed him. If anything has happened to her-- You better not, Gordon. One of Ming's ships landed while we were in the moat. If Ming has her, you might need me as hostage. Roka, lock him up. Operator, see if you can contact the palace. Wait a moment. If he has Dale and Ronal prisoner, perhaps he'll make the first move. Welcome, Thong and Lady Sonja. I understand you bring us prisoners of importance. Thank you, your Majesty. Dale Arden and Captain Ronal have been confined in separate apartments and await Your Majesty's pleasure. Please leave us now. I have things to say to these two alone. - I am ill served, it seems. - Sire! Two of my best ships and crews destroyed. Captain Torch, my ablest soldier and counselor, you have left in the hands of my enemies. Your Majesty has many ships and soldiers, but there's only one Dale Arden. No doubt Prince Barin would be glad to exchange Captain Torch for her. What do you mean? Your captain or your bride, sire? Bring Dale Arden to me at once. No trace of any of them, but we verified the report that one of Ming's ships did actually land at the castle during the gas raid. The settles it. I'm going after Ming. I'll go with you. Will Your Highness caution our guards to Watch the prisoner Torch very closely? The Emperor's palace is calling. Man: Ming will speak to his servant Prince Barin over the televisor. Prince Barin will speak to Ming the tyrant. Barin, I see you have your allies with you. That makes it simpler. One of my ships has just brought in a couple of prisoners, Dale Arden and a Captain Ronal. Let me talk to him. Listen, Ming, if you harm Dale Arden, I'll come there and kill you with my bare hands. I'm not interested or disturbed by the ravings of a madman. Dale has not been harmed. She will tell you so herself. Step here, my child. Flash, get me out of here. Get me out. Dale, Dale listen to me. Don't be afraid. We'll get you out somehow. Now, if I may speak to Dr. Zarkov, I may exchange this lady for my Captain Torch. And what terms do you propose to make, Ming? An even exchange-- or better than that, I'll toss in Captain Ronal, who is of no importance to me. It's a trick. He'll lay a trap for us. And how do you propose to make the exchange? As your friend Flash is suspicious, I will agree to any arrangements you make, but you must decide now. I'll not renew the offer. Oh, agree, doctor! Flash, get me out of here! Get me out. He can't trick us if we arrange the terms. In any event, we have no choice. All right, all right. Make a deal! Make a deal! We will make the exchange on the following terms. Flash Gordon and I will bring Captain Torch. Prepare a ship at once. It shall be done, sire. Sonja, be sure Dale has refreshments prepared for her before she leaves. Good-bye, my dear. I'm sure we will meet again. They're coming. Well, cut me loose. We'll let you go when we're assured Dale and Ronal are safe. - Are you satisfied? - Yes. Your friend Thong will untie you. Message from the Emperor. For Dr. Zarkov. Start walking. Oh, Flash! Flash! Quick, inside. ( sighs ) Dale, what is it? Zarkov, quickly! She's been drugged. Ming, that devil. Wait, I was given this for you, doctor, as I left the ship. "Zarkov, you have no antidote that will revive Dale. Her only chance to live is that you alone bring her to me at once. Delay will be fatal." Think he's telling the truth? Yes, Flash, she's dying. I must take her back to Ming's. I'll drop you and Ronal at Barin's before I go. Whatever you do, give me time to get Dale to Ming. After she's revived, I'll see what can be done about contriving an escape. All right, doc. Bye, doctor. No, no. We must find a way of getting into Ming's palace without endangering the lives of the Princess Aura and the prisoners. Then once inside, with the help of Zarkov and Captain Sudan-- There's an abandoned tunnel. Not the one we were trapped in before? No, this is on the other side of the palace. It leads into the tombs directly beneath the caverns. That is, if the way is clear. If it isn't, we'll clear it. Zarkov's rocket ship is serviced and ready. We are ready, Your Highness. Oh, no, Ronal. Numbers won't help us on this trip. Three might succeed where more would fail. You wait for word from us. You did well to obey me and bring Dale here, Zarkov. Only I could have awakened her from the death sleep into which I'd cast her. I'm taking you to my daughter Princess Aura. And as for you, Zarkov, any attempt to escape will result disastrously both for you and Dale. It's all right, Dale. We're to be the guests of the Emperor for a short time. Come my dear. Karm is dead. Ming discovered that he was conspiring with Prince Barin. And you? Are you suspected? The lives of all of us are in constant danger, but so far suspicion hasn't rested on me. You and I must contrive some means to free the prisoners and make the revolt against Ming a success. Karm learned much of the secret of Ming's power before he died. That secret is now mine. Come, I'll show you. Dale! Aura, I can't say I'm happy to see you. Are Flash and Barin prisoners, too? No, just Dr. Zarkov and I, but Flash will come and save us, I'm sure. Very, very pretty, my dear, and very optimistic. No one is going to save you. Even if rescuers could get into the palace, they could not enter this room and live. You have failed to stop Flash Gordon before, Father. Yes, but I'll not fail this time, my dear. You have corrupted my guards, so I placed you in this room with an incorruptible guard. That rug will be charged with 4,000 volts of electricity the moment that I go through that door. I had it placed there to guard my own life against treachery while I slept. And now it is to be used to prevent the escape of my prospective bride. If you touch that rug after I leave this room, you will be instantly killed. Remember, I have warned you. I don't believe him. It's another one of his crafty tricks. Why, Dale, I've stepped on that rug a hundred times and-- Stop, Aura. I don't think he was bluffing. Wait a minute. Do you think the entrance to the deserted tunnel will be guarded? No, Captain Sudan's the heart of the conspiracy to overthrow Ming. He'll know we'll attempt to do something. I'm sure he'll do everything he can to make our entrance possible. Was the sentry postmen doubled as I instructed? - Yes, sire. - Good. What about the entrance of the deserted tunnel north of the castle? Why, we have always considered an entrance through the old tombs was impossible, sire. It is not of any importance what you consider. We have Flash Gordon to deal with. Have guards to go to that tunnel, men that you can depend upon. Good landing, Flash. We're right near the tunnel entrance. I hope Captain Sudan has been able to leave it unguarded. Have you received instructions about preparing the Earth girl for her wedding, Lady Sonja? Yes, sire. Is it Your Majesty's wish that I go to her tonight? No, tomorrow will be time enough. Sire. Barin! - Grode! - Your Highness. Flash, this is one of Captain Sudan's men! Your Highness nearly finished me. Sorry, Grode, but our mission's a desperate one. What about your companion here? He's one of us. Sudan placed us here to help you if you came. If you can, get us into the tunnel. Tell us where the princess and Dale Arden are locked up. They're in Ming's private sanctum-- the north room. - I can guide you there. - No, you've taken risk enough. I know the way. Let's have a uniform, so we look as if we have an official escort if we meet anyone. All right, Your Highness. Inside, quickly. What's that? The wind in the caverns is higher up. Well, it doesn't sound like wind to me. Sounds like... Look. Ming's ancient dungeons. Come on, we'll have worse than that to face. This leads to the corridors of the north wing. Grode had no key for it. You wait out here. I'll go in alone. This may be a trap. Flash, stop where you are! Flash, what happened? Aura, Dale, what was it? Barin, don't move! The rug, it's electrified! There must be a switch outside the door. Father turned the current on from out there. It's all right. The current's off. Flash, I thought you were killed. Not quite. We got to get out of here quick! Quick! Halt! To the north room, quickly! Nice trick, Roka. Your Majesty, Captain Torch reports that Flash Gordon and his comrades have rescued Dale Arden and Princess Aura and have fled with them. They can't go far. Summon the guard and search for them. Watch the laboratory. They may attempt to release Dr. Zarkov, also. These prisoners are to be admitted and held in here. - This is not a prison. - This is an order. - Are you going to obey? - Yes, by placing you under arrest. Man: Guards! Guards! ( knocking on door ) It will take them two hours to break down that door. And by that time I shall have a better and more effective defense. Let's hide these guys somewhere and take their uniforms. ( alarm continues ) Remain here on guard. I must report this to his Majesty. Karm, who you knew, Barin, had been a prisoner here for years-- finally discovered the source of the terrific power Ming controls. Karm confided the secret to you? Yes, to Druk, here. The power is derived from a strong beam of light reflected from pure therenium, a new element which gives the light great properties. and permits it to be transformed into other forms of energy. Where does the light come from? Where all light and power originates-- the sun. And it is this therenium that energizes the purple death dust, the great fire projectile, and all of Ming's weapons of death and destruction. Sire, the Earth party with Barin and Aura have barricaded themselves in the laboratory. Surround the laboratory, but do not attack without an order from me. But, sire, with our numbers, we can attack and conquer them. No, no! Don't you realize that with Dr. Zarkov in possession of my laboratory, he is more powerful than I am in my own kingdom? Dr. Zarkov is clever. No doubt he has learned from Karm the secret of my sun power. If we attack, he'll destroy us. No, he must be tricked into coming out, and I'll find the way. If we can control Ming's powerhouse, we can handle him. We can destroy him and his palace, but that would mean our death as well. It would be worth it, if we can save the universe by doing so. My forces have you surrounded, Zarkov. They will attack if you do not surrender immediately. You don't dare attack. And why not? Because I control the source of your power and can destroy you with it. You would not dare. I would not hesitate. Our mission is not only to save the world, but the universe, as well. The universe? I am the universe. I'll give you just one hour to surrender. I have another source of power that you know nothing of. - Do you believe him? - I don't wholly doubt him. But don't you think he's stalling for time? No, but our only safety at present is to remain here. Then why can't Barin send for some of his ships? We can keep Ming from attacking him with you in control here, can't we? - Flash is right. - Yes. Through Captain Sudan I can arrange an attack. But only as a last resort. As you know, Ming is cunning and treacherous. We must learn what he's up to. Perhaps you two in your disguise might learn his plans. Yes, but, Zarkov, how can we get out of here? Karm has shown me a secret passage that leads to the caverns that even Ming doesn't know of. - I'm willing. What about you, Roka? - I'll go with you. You hold the fort here. We'll get as close as we can to Ming and find out what he's up to. Right. Halt. What are you palace guards doing down here? Searching the cavern, sir. Captain Sudan's orders. - Did you see anybody in there? - No, sir. All palace guards must remain on duty near the throne room. These men will relieve you. Come! Allow no one to enter or your lives are forfeit. Yes, sir. Roka, you keep me covered. I'm relieving you. Go to the laboratory at once. They need help there. What we must do is to find a way to trick Dr. Zarkov and his party into leaving the laboratory. Have you rocket ship Z-O loaded to my new solarite? Yes, sire, it's ready in the space court for the attack on the principal cities of the Earth. I think it would be smarter to forget the Earth until we have rid ourselves of the Earth people now on Mongo. We can use the solarite ship as a threat to trap them. Check the solarite ship again and make sure it's ready to depart - at a moment's notice. - I will, sire. In the meantime, I'll communicate with Dr. Zarkov again. And now, if I may speak to Dr. Zarkov... My rocket ship is loaded with enough solarite to destroy the principal cities of the Earth on contact. It is in my space court now. We will send it, if you do not surrender at once. I doubt very much that one ship can do so much damage. I have enough ships and solarite to destroy your entire Earth. If you knew the power of it, you would not hesitate to meet my terms. This is a serious matter. I must consult my associates. Very well. I'll give you five minutes. Kind of you. Don't you believe him, Zarkov. He's going to double-cross us. You mean, he has no such ship - as the rocket ship Z-O? - He has, he has. But he's going to send it against the Earth whether we surrender or not. I doubt very much if he has the powerful explosive solarite he speaks of. Ming's scientists have for years been searching for an explosive powerful enough to destroy the Earth. I believe they have found it. - Then there's only one way out. - And that is? Take Ming's Z-O ship and destroy him with it. It all depends on whether you can control the defensive mechanism of the space court here. It can be done. Where will we be when you destroy Ming? In Zarkov's rocket ship. I'll take off in the solarite ship and head back toward the palace, then bail out. You ought to be able to pick me up. Then you'd better let me go with you. No use two of us sacrificing ourselves. Zarkov doesn't answer our signal, sir. I'll stay here and control the death rays - that guard the entrance to the space court. - It means your death. Ming killed my spirit when he destroyed my people. For years, I've been waiting for this chance to avenge them. I understand. Notify Captain Sudan to open the tunnel gates for us. - I will. - Good-bye, my friend. Thank you. We'll never forget you, professor. Order the guards doubled at all possible exits. I fear the Earth people are up to something we know nothing of. Warm up the motor so we'll be ready to leave the moment Dr. Zarkov arrives. Flash, wait. That's the ship with the solarite aboard. Are you sure? Yes, Ming called it his Z-O ship. You can't get out of the space court until I signal Druk to turn off the death ray. Look! That was caused by the death ray operated by Druk. - Hello. Hello, Druk? - Yes. Turn off the death ray on number seven. They're off. He says the death rays are turned off at number seven. All clear, Flash. I'll circle with the Z-O ship until you take off and join me. Right, we'll keep in touch by radio. Good. I hope there's a parachute aboard. I'm sure there is. It's an essential part of the equipment. Well, good luck, Flash. Thanks. Yes. Yes! I'll report it. Your Majesty, Flash Gordon has just entered the space court and taken off with your solarite ship. Why didn't any of my guards stop him? The guards cannot enter the space court. The death ray has been turned on. It's the work of that clever fiend Zarkov. He's at the controls in the laboratory. Dr. Zarkov. We're still in no danger from the solarite ship. Gordon would not destroy his friends. Captain Torch speaking. Yes. Yes! I'll report. Sire, Dr. Zarkov and the rest of the Earth people, including Prince Barin and Princess Aura, have escaped through the tunnel. They've taken off in their rocket ship. Then Gordon will use the solarite ship to destroy me. We must leave at once for the tower and use the auxiliary controls from there. Order Captain Sudan to have them turned on. You'll find him in the guard room. Captain Torch calling Captain Sudan. I can't get Captain Sudan, sire. You must! Our lives depend on it. Keep trying. Captain Torch calling Captain Sudan. Sudan, connect the controls in the tower room at once! I never thought it would ever be in my power to save Ming the Merciless, or to destroy him. Then you will not connect the controls? No. Calling Captain Sudan in the guard control room. - Hello? Is this Druk? Yes, this is Druk. Listen, can you contact Zarkov? Yes, I can, Captain Sudan. Good. Tell him that Ming has gone to the tower control room. All right, I will. Druk calling Dr. Zarkov. Calling Dr. Zarkov. Listen carefully. Ming has taken refuge in his tower control room. Tell Flash Gordon to head his solarite ship directly at the tower. I'll tell him. And that means you'll be saved, Druk. I know that. But it also means that we can place Prince Barin on the throne of Mongo. Now we can save others who should not suffer for Ming's misdeeds. Flash. Flash. Go ahead, Zarkov. Ming has gone to his tower control room. You know where it is? Yes, I'll head toward there instead of the palace. Good. Let us know when you're ready. Don't worry, I will. Captain Sudan doesn't answer, sire. We're doomed. - Send a messenger to him. - There's no time for that. Our only chance is that Captain Sudan will connect the controls. Then we can explode the solarite ship while it's in the air. Captain Sudan, your emperor demands that you connect the controls in the tower room immediately. Why doesn't Flash bail out? He's close enough now. Not yet. He can't afford to miss. You've locked Ming and his retinue in the tower. Yes, and there's only one other way of escape for them, but they will be too terrified to think of it. All ready, Zarkov. Cut the speed down as low as possible. Flash! Do you think the solarite ship will hit the tower? I'm sure it will. Watch the fireworks. Look! The solarite ship is nearly upon us. To the caverns or your lives! It's locked. Zarkov: Ming is no more. The world is safe. And our warriors free. By destroying Ming, you have saved the universe. In his mad ambition, Ming declared that he was the universe. Then since you have conquered Ming, I shall radio your father-- "Flash Gordon conquers the universe." And saves the Earth. What's our course now, Flash? Straight for Arboria and back home.
