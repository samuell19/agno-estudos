Why does he not prepare it while he is in his country? Because they don't have any more bears They killed it so they could build highways And the wolves as well Well, they've evolved very well Should we still be the zoo of Europe? Like they did in Africa Except that we are not savages Please, let him speak Calm down! . Thank you ..just wanted to say .that people today are free to move around This justifies the number of blacks and Arabs .in Paris more than the French We no longer dare to take the metro .But these people are French If you want settlers, accept them yourselves we do not have. Then what are they doing here? Sir, there are people too From here they beg in Paris Hungarians never beg! Neither do the Romanians They are gypsies! .don't mix things up . Roma. Yes, but they are also citizens ...Listen, Mr. Fraternity and Equality If you love them so much Why do you send them back to us? .because they are forced to integrate into their country It is impossible to merge gypsies Stop hiding behind your finger! Calm down, please If you were so talented, you would You have already managed to integrate blacks and Arabs .but we've merged them - Oh really? - They'll cut your throat before that. And that would be fine. You haven't learned anything from Charlie Hebdo You no longer have anything sacred Let's close parenthesis on So, back to our topic ..by our respect Who is disrespectful to? Can we now tell the truth? Go back to communism! You will be punished if you speak your mind Please, let's get back to the topic We are right about that We have seen what happened in other countries ...it starts with one, two Then they bring the whole family This is their way After that they want mosques In Germany, it is not possible .one even enter their neighborhoods They attack women in the street if they are not veiled .I don't think we are threatened by that in this village But if we let them come Will they claim their rights? .using bombs and all forms of mayhem Let them go away! Rest assured, no attacks will happen here Even if they blow us all up We will not appear on the pages of newspapers What are you saying? Let's get back to you, Doctor, but .Enter the subject directly. .I have one remark to make .."I don't know these people from Bangladesh .They're from Sri Lanka .from Sri Lanka. And they may be very clean And I'll say it in Romanian so everyone can understand ...scientifically, diseases are different .GIVE me your hand their diseases and viruses And their immune response as well This is how we got AIDS, bird flu .God knows what's next through human societies directly related to animals ...monkeys, bears and bats They spread epidemics because they are They can go anywhere! Doctor They were given a comprehensive health check before being employed ...If you allow .It is a matter of cleanliness Excuse me, but Muslims .they don't use toilet paper ...they work in the bakery They are not Muslims! .albeit - !If you allow Mister Paccio .I have one last thing The end of the world is not a nuclear bomb It's with all these people who invade us While the European Union pays us Money to grow orchards in the countryside He wants pickles according to the specifications !It's easy to make your own pickles according to your specifications! .This is a fact Why is a garden made in the mountains? I can answer you in this regard This allows us to access Subsidies available from the European Union For this, gardens were established in rural areas What about the water channels? And paved roads? There were no grants for this But with park aid money We lit the public streets I raise my hand from the beginning Stay on topic. I'll stay on topic. My name is Prebo Vasily For those who don't know me I worked in the factory The real problem is Why are foreigners employed in our places? People here don't want to work How is that? Are you paying them enough? They would rather live on unemployment benefits This is a big fallacy. I disagree Aside from having only one pair of pants .or two, as is the case everywhere Our men work hard in every country they go to You know that very well, understand .don't browse in those countries When the Westerner appoints you, he exploits you .but he pays you more .well said. thank you sir The question is: why pay Factory wages that bad? Why don't you pay extra? We pay the workers! double pay incorrect! 43 hours out Overtime and not paid .I even filed a case against you You can check, we have been paying them since 2018 You wouldn't think I would believe that I'm a former employee I am in a position to say ..I tell everyone that I'm working overtime I didn't get any wages Mr. Pribo... ...Mr. Mayor - ..I speak on behalf of all workers .who dare not say anything For fear of being expelled The ads have been there for weeks We want to hire people .at the minimum wage What if bread costs 5 lei? And why not be 10? At the bakery, we work hard, even during the holidays You need fresh bread every day .This is a fact You really have to work hard? - .Yes - So why doesn't that apply to you, too? How much does that Mercedes cost? While paying your workers a pittance! My car is rented All this on the backs of your workers, madam The priest also has a Mercedes .it's for my mom .a used car .we are still going off topic Thank you, Mr. Pribo, we have heard your complaint ...excuse me, I think we have the right to reply In Romanian, please! .Good - .listen In the last years, We created most of the local jobs We also support the local orchestra We want to continue developing the region For this, we are applying for European funds As if the money would come back to us. Yes, this money will be spent here. You mean money that does not spill out of your pocket We're still getting off topic .I suggest we take a vote who votes to hire foreigners Who were brought to the village? . That would be obvious. Mathias? I didn't quite understand .who vote to remain aliens The problem is not well presented Of course it was well put up! We are afraid of public opinion But we clearly don't want them here Here is what I suggest to avoid complicating the situation ...we'll outfit the aliens with a pair of gloves Otherwise, we will change their place And they won't touch the dough anymore We don't want them, is that hard to understand? What if we live in another village? No, let them go! Who agrees not to buy Bake them at the moment? There are still laws in this country And that's why we want to decide for ourselves Therefore, we will not take orders How are you Hungarians? ..who constitute a minority among us Do you discriminate against other strangers? "Honor Matthias" Mathias, where are you? Mathias, come home. What happened? - Father Otto has hanged himself! May God have mercy on him .Help me .I love you, Dad .I love you Let's apply again In the “less than 30 employees” category . We don't have time for that anymore. . We're going to stop production and we're all going to work on it tonight. . The other two are due to arrive tonight . Let's revoke their acceptance - ...we can't - So what are we going to do in light of this situation? .They are human beings - .I am well aware that they are human beings - .But we're human too , without customers , what took ten years to build will disappear .And we'll all end up on the street .Nobody will end up on the street .You'll find a job, and you'll leave me alone in debt .Please go ahead and come forward again .No, I won't do that again have a family, contracts, we can't Washing our hands is one of our obligations. .Nobody washes their hands of anything .I spoke to the mayor They will sleep tonight at the station. .
