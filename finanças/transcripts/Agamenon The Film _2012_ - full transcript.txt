Today we'll try to talk... to one of the most mysterious Brazilian journalists, A game non Mendes Pedreira, who has a daily column, every Sunday, in the newspaper 0 Globo. Let's try to make contact with this legendary personality, a recluse man who lives in this rusty Dodge Dart 73, parked in front of the Newspaper's Headquarter. Hello, is A game non there? I'm the reporter Pedro Bial, he lives here, right? Yes, sir, but Mr. A game non is not here. Where did he go? He said that he went to the shop on the corner... for a pack of cigarettes. I think I know where he is. Let's go. There, in that bar, he usually gets his packs over there, having his coffee, creating his news. Look! It's him! The one in the suit. A game non! Look out, he's got a gun! THE ADVENTURES OF AGAMENON, THE REPORTER Who is A game non Mendes Pedreira? Who is this famous combative journalist, moralist and a bad character? What goes in that hairless head? How much does he have in his wallet? How many women support him? A game non is eternal, A game non has begun before... CAETANO VELOSO - COMPOSER the birth of Brazilian press, and he will go on even after the end of this press. I know A game non very well, a fighter, FERNANDO HENRIQUE CARDOSO FORMER PRESIDENT a man who fought for democracy, the freedom of the press, unblemished character, and more, always saying what he does not think. PAULO COELHO - WRITER] WIZARD A game non inspired me... to write that song, "I Was Born 10 Thousand Years Ago”, because I know that A game non has his contacts in the past. I must confess something, A game non was the biggest... SUZANA VIEIRA - ACTRESS was the biggest... non hard-no in my life. But I think he is the best. I mean, just a little. 30 SOARES - HUMORIST In the beginning of my career, A game non was the only person who has given me a hand. The problem was that we were at the 3° floor... and the window was opened, then I was actually broken. ZECA PAGODINHO - SINGER/COMPOSER A game non is a nice person, I have already gone for a ride and a beer on that Dodge Dart, tasted Isaura snacks... A game non sang a samba... and wanted me to record that samba, he told me: "Man, if you do not record this... samba so I could make money on that, I'll have to mug you". But the samba was bad, and then I told him: "So do it, my brother, this samba is very bad and I'm not recording it." Wait a second, NELSON MOTTA - JOURNALIST/ACTOR about who am I talking about? I don't know, it is because I'm on every kind of documentary, I don't even know about whom I'm giving my testimony. A game non? No Brazilian journalist has covered so many facts, world wars and famous women, not necessarily on that order. Always chasing a scoop, he used his amazing Journalistic nose... to be inside the most exclusive news and women. Greta Garbo, Grace Kelly, Lady Gaga... and Mother Teresa of Calcutta. No one of these stars resisted... to A game non is charm and blackmails. Rita Lee, Claudia Raia and Fernanda Montenegro. Who? Me? No way! MY BERRIED ROOTS INTERVIEW FOR BBC IN AUGUST 23, 1949 Mr. A game non Mendes Pedreira, tell us about yearly childhood... Well, my childhood was really poor and miserable. My father, poor man, was a huge business man... from the Petrochemical and shipbuilding fields, and financial market, and he had a very rough life. Poor daddy, his wealthy earned Money, so hard to get, wasn't enough to cover our house expenses. But despite your indigent poverty, have very noble ancestors in Brazil, isn't that so Mr. Pedreira? Correct. I'm the great-grandson of Joaquim Herculano... Camargo Correa Queiroz Galvao Andrade Guttierrez, known as Baron of de Pau Barbado. Baron of Pau Bar bad a, was a human slaves' dealer, bloodthirsty, oligarch and landowner with no scruples. He wasn't a bad man. He was a lousy man. Baron of Pau Bar bad a... was the terror of afro-descendent people. He had more than 30 thousand slaves on his farm... where he planted manioc, sugar cane, coffee, yam and marijuana. Modern man, full of liberal ideas, Baron of Pau Barbado was the first feudal landowner... to introduce the tree trunk in Brazilian slavery. In Colonial Brazil, the slavers were not considered marginal... as the dealers of nowadays. What's up, Baron? What's it going to be? We have in white, black, and even more black. Because of his insatiable sexual appetite... and always famished, Baron of Bar bad a had several illegitimate children, among which stand out... two grandparents and three parents of mine. A game non Mendes Pedreira was born in Pindayba, a suburb of Central do Brazil, located beyond Queimados. Far beyond. Actually, it was very far. Pindayba is a very needy and miserable place, where the traditional school picture... was taken by Sebastido Salgado. We were so poor, that in our house... we didn't have clothes for everybody, the only one was my mother's wedding dress. When my father went out to work, he wore the wedding dress, and we were naked all the time. "KIDS, DADDY IS GOING TO WORK!" "DADDY, PLEASE: WOULD YOU BRING US ANOTHER ROCK FOR US TO MAKE A SOUP..." "THE ONE THAT YOU BROUGHT LAST WEEK IS ALREADY OVER." RUY CASTRO NON AUTHORIZED BIOGRAPHER A game non Mendes Pedreira says he was born in Pindayba, but this is not true. I have documents proving that he was not born there. A game non says that he was born in Pindayba... because he is ashamed of saying that he was born here, in Jardim Miseré, which is much worse. The world capitol of dengue, aphtose fever and swine flu. A game non Mendes Pedreira lives in a Dodge Dart 73, rusty, and parked in front of the gate of 0 Globo. Bye, love. A game non is married with Isaura, his lady, with whom he has a solid and stable marriage... Even because Isaura, who is a very discrete lady, does not go out much. But how has A game non Mendes Pedreira... became one of biggest myths of Brazilian journalism? PEDRO BIAL - JOURNALIST My feeling towards A game non, are a mix of love and hate. Let's put it that way, 99,9% of hate and the remaining is love. He is more transparent... than the other Brazilian journalists. A man who... makes you know the man behind the reporter, knowing where he lives, his wife's name, the details of his married life. That makes him to be a journalist who the readers really know, in whom we can trust on. Look, the importance of A game non to Brazilian journalism... is zero, actually. I think that Agamenon's strength is the absence of importance. I have already made the biography of Nelson Rodrigues, Garrincha and Carmem Miranda. I think that A game non is almost as horny as Nelson Rodrigues, and as exuberant as Carmem Miranda. But the difference between him and Garrincha... is that Garrincha had a big talent, and A game non's, smaller. It's over? -It's over? -Yes. -Can I see it? -Yes, you can. It's unbelievable. For his shy attitude, recluse and weird, A game non Mendes Pedreira, is used to walk around town... in disguises, incognito, low profile. Our camera managed to catch A game non... walking in the Leblon streets. A few people enjoy the journalist's intimacy. One of them is the myth and also recluse singer, Tom Gilberto, one of the Boss a Nova creators, who is accompanied by one of his most famous creations, the Pato. Actually, the Pato is not from Joao Gilberto. It is from Jay me Silva and Neuza Teixeira. I saw A game non a few times in Joao Gilberto's building, but I haven't seen him coming out. So, I do not know what happens inside. It could be the release of a breakthrough book, "The Secret Life Of Joao Gilberto", by A game non Mendes Pedreira. It could be. A game non is gang of friends is complete with the presence... of the consecrated writer and the wizard, Paulo Coelho. But what brings, this strange triad of genius... and renowned names in Brazilian culture together? A game non, 1050 Gilberto and I use to go out a lat at night; the night in Rio. We are often at Prado Junior, several nights, we meet very interesting people. This cultural meeting are recorded... in some piracy material to which we had access to. Spite of the Pato protests, the talented singer from Bahia... always shares some tunes with his friends. Pato is an indecent bird, He is charming and persistent, Virile And gets laid a lot, Oh man, man The Goose, It was completely drown Approached the swan and did like this you'll do just fine, very good, very well If the chicken is doing nothing Will not say no, he'll catch it The turkey will be the stuffing But this duck done full of crabs Banged the drake in the woods Rumor has it that he even invited Lady Gaga For an animal sex. 0 Pato! Very good! Bravo! Bravo! No, no! THE GREAT STORIES OF AGAMENON MENDES PEDREIRA THE TITANIC SUICIDE Since I was a boy, my biggest dream was to make a cruise... in a super Hollywood production. After being three years without lunch and dinner, I managed to save money to buy a ticket... to be a movie extra in Titanic's third class. Titanic was just like Brazil, the rich people on top, just fine... and the poor were piled down in the ship. And no one believed that someday it was going to sink. The luxury of Titanic's first class... was never seen before. The richest millionaires in the world, the Vanderbilts, the Rockfellers... Waltinho Moreira Salles and Eike Batista... were fighting to see who would spend more money... and sleep with more women. Not necessarily in this order. The bathrooms from Titanic were sumptuously luxury. Aside the toilet, made from pure gold, there was this Malay dwarf 24 hours a day, at the disposal... to perform the intimate hygiene... of the forsaken magnates. While the rich people were swimming in caviar, we, from the third class of the ship, only had Leonardo DiCaprio. Is this line stuck, or what? I'm starving here!... Considering the huge line, I didn't even taste it. Sympathizing with my state of penury, a mouse offered me a piece of cheese, which sustained me throughout the dramatic journey. Thanks, Tom. Not Tom, Tom is the cat. I'm Jerry! Sorry. That is for Tom! On a cold night, I decided to go to the bridge deck... to smoke a beck with the ship's Captain. The old Wolf of the sea smoked the huge cigarette... that last for the entire crew. -It's for you. -Thank you. -It's from Bahia. Crazy by the effects of marijuana, the Titanic's orchestra began to play... Bob Marley's greatest hits... who at that time, wasn't even born. Commander, commander! An iceberg ahead, commander! -An iceberg! -Calm down! Iceberg, Goldenberg, Rosenberg, it is all the same! Roll over! At that moment, I found out that the commander, besides pothead, was anti-Semite and liked old jokes. Frightened, I threw myself... into the icy waters of North Atlantic... and grabbed a stick that was floating. What I didn't know was that the stick... was Leonardo DiCaprio's. INTERVIEW FOR RAI IN AUGUST 23, 1949 Mr. A game non Pedeiro... Pedreira... how did the audience received your story... about the Titanic shipwreck? Well, that was a very important moment to my career, a moment of success, consecration, everyone was really happy, stunned, especially because they thought I had died. AFTER THE SHIPWRECK, ON A PARADISE ISLAND After being adrift for days... in the cold water of North Atlantic, A game non finally managed to reach earth. There the Young and naive journalist... experienced one of the most bizarre... and strange moments of his life. "SO WHAT, BABES, WHAT'S GOING ON?" "HANDSOME MAN, GO THERE BEHIND THE FENCE!" "PUT YOUR DICK IN HERE THAT I'M GOING TO GET MY GIRLFRIENDS." With the aid of expert women, masters in the sexual arts, A game non, step by step, was introduced in a magical and naughty world. A world in which he got in and never left. "WHAT'S UP GIRLS? WAS IT GOOD FOR YOU TOO!?" The Young A game non, who didn't knew a woman yet, in the biblical sense, in other words, inside out, surrender himself to the pleasures... of wild and animal sex. Literally animal. As all the seventeen and a half readers of A game non... are well aware, the journalist is pretty close... to Dr. Jacintho Leite Aquino Régo, the word famous psycoproctologist. Thank you, thank you. Thank you for everything. I congratulate the Sweden Science Academy... for conceding this honor for the first time to a Brazilian, in that case, myself. At least you spotted one, okay? I came up with the idea... of creating the Psycoproctolgy Science... when I underwent to a prostate exam, a regular exam, which I perform around 15 times a week, sort of. During an exam, I suddenly had an insight. "THE PSICOPROCTOLOGIC EXAM" Knower of Sigmund Freud's theories, I realized that the brain, where the emotions are, sorrows... and also the human being psychosis, could be accessed through another way, against the digestion path. To facilitate this invasive exam, and most of times, painful, I invented this device. The estreptojeboscopoc. A high tech electronic device which allows to measure... and analyze the neurosis from neurological origin... The deepest origins. This same device, in a bigger version... that I have developed myself along with NASA, was very valuable in the mining rescue... in Chile in 2010. Ac tiene um band a de locos! Locos por ti, Jacintho! Jacintho! Jacintho! At the end of his working day, even tired, A game non never, never missed his sessions... with Dr. Jacintho Leite Aquino Régo. Dr. Jacintho, therapist and confident of A game non, is one of the only person in the world... to whom the journalist opens himself. And to open yourself to a psycoproctologist... is a painful thing. A game non, I'm noticing here a little stress in your Queen-Fold, and as you are well aware, the Queen-Fold is very important! It is the main beam... which supports the rectum pavilion! Impossible, Dr. Jacintho. I'm not into this! Calm down, A game non, trust me. We must go through this deeper. No, not deeper, doctor. It is too painful!

STEAKHOUSE - PORCCO NOVA DELI Gandhi, check this out, here is the thing: this pacifism talk will leave you a fame of being a wussy! Oh crap! Come on, no steaks here? Aren't you a vegetarian?

Now, behind the fame, behind physics, what is Albert's biggest dream? My biggest dream was to be on Big Brother. I think Bial is very hot.

Come on, Albert, you are rot! Did you eat a vulture? Dear Lord! And don't come with this talk that smell is all relative! Okay? A game non and his friends were very enthusiastic. This circle counted on the movie maker Orson Welles, Grande Otelo, Bando Da Lua... and a girl that they used to take out, Carmem Merenda. Intoxicated by the ether spray and other toxics, the group always called the night... in a distant Motel in Leblon, that used to be Barra da Tijuca at that time. In one of this bacchanal, A game non met the young student Isaura, from a traditional family in Rio, the Mello Pinto. It was love at first sight. Oh My God, look at that! Why she's doing this? The aristocratic Mel la Pinto, at the beginning, didn't like A game non, but with time, they started to hate him. I'm so glad that mom obligated me to go to that bacchanal. That orgy was too boring, but I met you there, A game non! When our eyes met, I forgot that I had other women. Soon I realize that among all the naked men, you were the biggest! Isaura, don't over react, I was on a good day! No, A game non, not the ear, A game non, I'm an ear virgin, and I'm trying to save myself for our honeymoon. -Isaura! -Daddy? -Go to your room! -Daddy! Mr. Agamanon, we are waiting for you. Mr. Agamanon, we need to have a little talk. It is not Agamanon, it is A game non. Exactly, Agamanon, you will not marry my daughter, not even for a dick! But that is the exact reason why she wants to marry me. You are immoral, a bastard, an indecent man! Madam Mello Pinto, I do have my flaws. However, love conquers everything. Let's go!

Spite of all the restrictions towards A game non, who according to them was not from a good family, No, I'm not signing anything! Mello Pinto demanded a traditional wedding, the civil and the religious, as well as in the police station. Sign it, A game non, it is just a little paper. Isaura, Isaura! So? Sheriff, excuse me, I have rights, I'm the father. Let me hit him! And in the balls, I will hit. -Wait! I do! -He will! Soon after the ceremony, the young couple left immediately to their honeymoon. A game non went to jail I'm a respected journalist! And Isaura to Peru. Peru, in that case, belonged to her cousin, Basilio. Unfortunately, the newly wed had to interrupt their honeymoon... and needed to be apart. Brazil was in World War Two! A game non Mendes Pedreira goes immediately to Europe, as a war correspondent of the newspapers 0 Dia, The Afternoon, and The Night. Take care, A game non! Stay alive. Goodbye, Isaura. The farewell between Isaura and A game non in the docks... left many people emotional. Bye, Isaura! Isaura! Isaura! Bye! Isaura, it's me! A game non! Here! At this idiot's side!

Who is our ally, the United States President? Roosevelt! Roosevelt! Shake it! Shake it! Let's get the Axis! Shake it! Shake it! Let's get the Axis! Play the harmonica! Play the harmonica! Harmonica! Play this thing! Play this thing! ICONS FROM THE WAR In those terrible years, full of uncertainties, the great world leaders had the honor to live with me. One of them was Winston Churchill, the well-known Winston Cachaca. Churchill spent the entire war behind a cigar, and because of the smoke, the Nazi never got him. Fat drunk and addicted in many things, Churchill was a kind of Tim Maia of that time. When he was not intoxicating himself, he dedicated his time to dramatic speeches... with catch-phrases I came up to him. Cold is the War, but my wife is much more. Nothing is what I offer to you, besides blood, sweat and a peperoni pizza! Penalty is so important... that the Queen herself should be in charge of it! This phrase of Churchill, A game non stole from Nen'm Prancha, famous soccer coach and beach weirdo. On a foggy London evening, under the German bombs, Churchill called urgently to the War Cabinet, the British govern HQ. Stressed out with the bombing, the old politician light up one of his famous cigars. Completely intoxicated, Churchill decided that in that moment... moment he was going to invade Normandy. Normandy was the general Montgomery's... hot secretary... that, on those days, was fighting in Africa. Patriot, the assistant agreed with the invasion... spit of being on those days. The D Day. From all the adventures lived during the World War 11, the one that marked the most A game non Mendes Pedreira... was the turbulent relation with the genocidal dictator... Adolf Hitler. I met Hitler in person in Reichstag, Berlin. Moron! Fritz, how can I say: "hurry on, damned" in German? A game non, come here! Let go of my hand! Let go, now! Let it go! Let go of my hand, now! Got you! You got punked, A game non! You got punked! Hitler wasn't such a bad guy. He was a terrible man. But what was Isaura, A game non's lady, doing in Brazil? Always worried about the social side, along with the finest ladies of our society, created the campaign... "Give an Ass for the Sake of Brazil". This historical campaign raised many founds for our military. At that same time, I had an intense romance with Eva Braun. To be in a relationship with the mistress... of a famous Nazi in Hitlerist German... was a risky business, even not being a Jew. Hitler's mistress was known by her uterine fuhrer. Inspired on her genitals, the architect Walter Gropius created... the famous crusher Braun Minipiner. Eva Braun and I always met when Hitler was out... to buy rye bread and invade Poland, One day, peevish, I told her... Eva, I can't take the front anymore! Today I'll be in the bunker! No, the bunker is too painful! Eva, this are war times! Everyone has to make sacrifices, today I'll go to the bunker and that's it. No way, A game non! And I'm a catholic. There is one more thing, Hitler is completely paranoid. He doesn't come out of the bunker for nothing. I I -A game non... When Berlin was under attack, Eva organized a little bacchanal for me. A Happy hour, I mean, a really good hour. At the time when his mistress was being invaded by North, South, East and Strait of Gibraltar, that wasn't narrow at all, the German dictator suddenly came to the party. I took advantage of the situation, said goodbye to Eva Braun, went for a pack of cigarettes in Czechoslovakia... and never came back. Fortunately, at the last seconds of the match, the World War 11 came to an end. From the window of the plane that released the atomic bomb, the Enola Gay, I was the only journalist that saw the great final... between Japan and United States... when the Sun Empire, despite of being the home team, lost the match. After the bomb, I wasn't the same person anymore. After that historical moment, I became another man. August 22nd, 1945. The first battalion of Brazilian expeditionary force... was returning from the European battle field. At that moment of patriotic exaltation, the great challenges that had to be faced were almost forgotten. The majority of these men... were returning to the civilian life. Isaura, this war experience has changed me a lot, I'm not the same person! I can see that, A game non. Not that you were Mr. Big Time, but you are much worse! You know how things are, Isaura. War, death, destruction, Hiroshima... All that, no one is the same. A game non, don't worry, I'll always love you. Isaura, but there are blessings in disguises, you know. The atomic bomb has caused a tremendous change in my anatomy. Wow, A game non! This will improve a lot our sex life! A game non arrived from the War 100%. With the new sexual positions that he learned in Europe, Isaura and him reached the highest point... in their sex lives! Yes! Bring it on! Unfortunately, that erotic idyll between me... and Isaura, my lady, came to an end when I received an anonymous letter... psychographed by Chico Xavier. But there is nothing written here! Psychograph this for me, please! A game non, open your eyes, dude! Your woman is cheating on you with Getulio! What? I've never believed in spiritism, but I always believed that Isaura, was a huge slut. To be cheated on by the president of the republic... was a great honor to any husband, but A game non, always an old fashion guy, decided to give an historical finale... to the adultery. Isaura, what is that in your mouth? Oh, A game non, it is Getulio's cigar! -But where is the smoke? -I swallowed it. Calm down, A game non, that's not what you are thinking. Me and Isaurinha are just good lovers. Getulio, be ready because I'm going to suicide you! A game non, you are a great journalist, so first, write my will for me! Alright, wait a second. Man, A game non, don't put an end into my life. Do me this favor. I'll fix you a job as a Director in Petrobras. Do you think I'm a jerk, Getulio? Petrobras hasn't even been created yet! See if it is good. -There is a comma missing. -Oh, right. You are wrong, A game non! You missed the shot! My bad, Getulio, now I did it. Spite of being married for more than 60 years... with Isaura, his lady, A game non, once in always, likes to change the menu. Nowadays, one of his regular lady friends... is the most famous prostitutes in Brazil, Bruna Chupetinha. You are a bad person! You bastard! Yeah, compliments, I want compliments! So today, we will try this one. Yeah, but here is the thing, this is not my size! I just wanted to spice up a little relationship. Ah, just spice it up? So I have a good one here. -Go, It's yours! -I'm coming in! Come with ball and everything! Between the legs! Come on, say it. Come on, say it! A game non, let's go the other room, which is much more exciting! Between the legs! Sixty-seven, sixty-eight, sixty-nine! Sixty-nine! Phenomenon? What is this? Well, just a little match. Can't you hear the music? Isn't soccer played only with one ball? I see many balls in the field! And who is that guy with ball and everything? A game non, you don't understand a thing about soccer. This man is from the back! No, man, Mulher Pepino! And that one must be Mulher Mandioca! Man, what a scoop! I'll upload this photo! Wait a second, A game non, this will ditch me out! Here is the deal. I give you some money... and you do not post this in the newspaper. What? Are you thinking that you can buy me out? Me, the great journalist A game non Mendes Pedreira? I want 500 bucks. 500? But here I only have three, four with mine. But not this one. A game non, you would not do that with a five time World Champion! Let's go Brazil! Let's go with the ball! Delicious! You... Never mind! In the beginning of the 60, Dallas was only a peaceful TV show... in the country side of Texas. No one could imagine that this boring town... would be the stage of one of the biggest tragedies... from 20th Century: the murder of John Fitzgerald Kennedy, Kenny G. John Fucking Kennedy was the biggest pervert of all, a kind of Bill Clinton from the 60'. One of his greatest conquests... was the actress and sex symbol Marilyn Monroe. The most erotic blond from the movies... was so in love with Kennedy that sang Happy Birthday to you... in his birthday. Congratulations! Congratulations! Today is your day, what a happy day! Let's go! Everybody! JFK you will eat my cake! But what most of you do not know... is that the president Kennedy was a cuckold because of me. In that time, I was sleeping with the United States First Lady, Jacqueline Onassis. In spite of being on the side of free initiative, Kennedy hated competitors. When he found out that there was a thief in the White House, the American president hired the killer... Lee Harvey Oswald de Andrade. In the middle of the motorcade, Lee Oswald, who had already worked in Military Police in Rio, fired his rifle from the top of a building. The first bullet hit Kennedy horn, rebounded and got into Jackie Kennedy's head. Considering it found nothing inside, the bullet exit from the other side. Unfortunately, Isaura, my lady lady didn't buy my treason... and she wanted to split. She wanted to split my dick from the rest of my body. It's not what you're thinking! I'm not thinking! Come over here! The decade of 60... was a period of great revolutionary disquietude, creative strength and general naughtiness. In that crazy time... I had the pleasure to meet the great African leader... Martin Luther King, the Pele'. Hey, King, I'm really hungry, don't you have something sweet for me to eat? A game non, I have a dream! With so many heavy drugs in my head in the 60, I ended up losing my conscious. I remember only of landing on the moon, along with the astronaut Louis Armstrong.

You want to get killed, asshole? For the first time in Brazil, the readers were going to know how a Popes Fight happens. In the left side of the match, Cardinal Karol Wojtyla. At the right side, Cardinal Lambretta! Fight! Father, Son and Holy Spirit.
