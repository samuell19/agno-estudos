When I was 16, I had lice in my hair. My mom shaved it all off. I looked like a peanut. I hated it. That wasn't the worst thing that happened that summer. When I was 16, my father went to the moon. ♪ Carry me over ♪ ♪ Them old desert sands ♪ ♪ The yellow moon shinin' On high ♪ ♪ Let me breathe The sweet air ♪ ♪ Of a pure desert night ♪ ♪ My feral pony and I ♪ ♪ Well, ridin' and ropin' ♪ ♪ Now, that's what I love ♪ ♪ A life in the open I crave ♪ ♪ The wild mountain rose... ♪ People used to vacation here.

Now we just have dust storms. ♪ My feral pony and I ♪ - Johnny! Johnny! Johnny! - Get off of him, man. - You fucked up, boy. - Get out of here, Johnny. Dad! Jesus Christ, Mickey. If he wants to be alone, he can be alone. So goddamn melodramatic. Speculation was that Uncle John went off to hide somewhere, maybe Mexico, because he thought he was in trouble about the fight. But he wasn't. We just never saw him again. Thank you for this food and that we can all be together. - Amen. - Amen. Quit it. Hey, stop fucking around and eat. I suppose it doesn't matter now why Uncle John left. All that matters, I guess, is that he did leave. The next day, we heard the factory would shut down for good. My father said that we could start over, and we believed him. But my mother? She's been my father's girl since she was 15. I don't want to drag you out there. I have to see how it is! Does that not make sense? - You're just gonna leave like everyone else? -I'm not everyone else. She started over with him one too many times to believe such a thing was possible. What aboutthem? Why do you think I'm doing this? What am I supposed to do? Just sit here and rot? - What do you want me to do? - I want you to think about us! There is nothing here! It's okay. I'll stay, okay? Yeah! It's still got a lot of power, okay? - Do not gas it. - Okay. You got to start off slow. Right? You tell him. - Don't go fast. - Start off slow. - You don't have to go fast the first time. -Okay. - Start it. Tell him to start it. - Start it, start it. Just don't crash. There we go. How's he doing? I'm going for the ribs. Are you ready? I'm just gonna use the bathroom, okay? I'll be right back. Are we home yet? No, not yet. Want some cookies? Where's Dad? He'll be back soon. I'm this one. No! No, no. - Yes! I win! - Such a cheater. - How am I cheating? - You just knocked me off. That's the whole point of the game. What's taking him so long? Hey, Dad? Dad! Hey. You can't park here. Let's go. Sonya Stecko said her dad wrote her a rambling 16-page letter. He said he loved her, and offered her advice about marriage, money, and other subjects. It was as if he'd planned to miss the next 30 years of her life. My neighbor Summer's dad left in the middle of the night. She found her dad's car in a ditch. There was no blood in the car. It was as if he vaporized out of the driver's seat and just floated away. Val's father owned the bar on Avenue A. One day he left the store unattended. He'd taken all the cash and left a note. After that, when a dad left, we'd just say, "He went to the moon." "We're going to the moon," we imagined them saying.

We told them they fish for supper there. They wear deer skins and make fires for heat. At sunset they sing all the old songs. The ones grandpa used to sing us. Kolya laughed so hard, he nearly wet himself. He wanted life here to be as good as the moon. So, what do you want? Just a little off the sides. I have a job interview tomorrow. You're definitely the longest hair I've had on a boy today. I don't really like getting my hair cut. I get it, I get it. We'll make it as painless as possible. Yo, guys. You know I once saw a flying "saucerus"? I was up in Joshua Tree camping with my dad. We couldn't find our car, so we tried to find our way by the stars. Then suddenly there was this noise and colored lights. I've never seen anything like it. I'm serious. No lie. Do you guys solemnly swear that we will not go to the moon? - Dude. - Fuck, yeah, I'm in. We're both in. Hey, Mickey. Do you swear that you won't go to the moon? Fuck, yeah. That's right. No moon. Cookie! - Cookie! - Cookie! - Cookie! - Cookie! Hey, Cook! What do you guys need?

He's never coming back. Ever. Open the door. Let me in, okay? Fuck. He is going to the moon. We're going to the moon. I'm going to the moon. Kolya? Kolya! We're gonna find him, okay? I don't care if we have to search the whole desert. We're gonna find him. Now, here's what we'll do. I'm gonna count to three, and then I'm gonna let go, and then we're gonna go back inside.

Even though the lake is almost gone, birds still come in the winter-- ducks, geese and cranes. They come back every year. I think about our dad, and how he'll be back by then too. Hey. It's your cousin, Val. Yo, Val. Did you know Mickey spread them legs? No, I'm serious. He was all up in that. She was like... Then she was like, "Yes! Mickey!" We're having a swordfight. Not a very good one, but... What's wrong? I'm pregnant. That night when we were together... I don't know. It's so stupid, I know. I... I don't expect anything from you. I just found out. I just thought I should let you know now. Mickey! Come back to the dark side! We're winning! No, wait, we're losing! Mickey... I'll talk to you later, okay? I'm your father. Mickey! Come back!

I imagine him in a castle, with pools and huge tables of food and beer. I imagine him lounging nude in hot tubs with women half his age, women who were on the moon when our fathers got there. I imagine the weather on the moon to be nice, and that our fathers are singing songs in praise of their new lives. I sense that there's music on the moon.

And I understand a little bit of animosity, and shit, hell, I get it, I really do. But, everybody kind of leaves for different reasons. Do you have any idea where he is? If you're looking for a dad, you found a hell of a dad. Shit. You're probably better off without us anyway, man. If we could turn back, I know we would. I sure the hell would. Onward and upward, you know. When are you coming back? Probably just another few months. At least I got to, you know, make sure the truck's running good enough to get there solid and safe. I don't know what the fuck to give him. I always knew he was strong. I'm glad to hear he's doing good. It's about time he started looking forward to getting into something better anyway. Just keep spending time with him. He needs something. You know what I mean? Is there some happiness in the desert? Of course there is. Still, that doesn't change everything. It doesn't change this. The moon follows us wherever we go.
