OCTOBER 2016 MUMBAI Hi. Hey, done with school? Dinesh! Did you put the tea leaves in the sink? Hasn't your mother taught you anything? Watchman! Call the plumber. The pipe has burst! Sushant! Dad! I've re-directed the flow. All the waste will go in here. Okay? This pipe needs to be replaced. -Sushant! -Dad! Come here. You lazy bum. What is it? Come for a game of carom. Coming. You start. You won't score anyway. Come down first. Hang this up to dry. One... Two... Three. SOUTH MUMBAI COOPERATIVE BANK Madam, your phone is ringing. That's the problem with Indians. We don't even trust machines. The poor thing has told you twice that it's 40,000. But no... We have to count it all over again. The machine's checked it twice. I've done it a third time. I hope you won't count it again. Why are these potatoes so big? Stock the smaller ones. There won't be worms in this, right? They don't take my permission before they enter it. -What's up, Sarita? -All good. -Back from work? -Yeah. Why? I'm coming from work, too. Feels good to be productive, right? Dinesh also works around the clock. It feels good to be busy. Our Guru always says, "To work is to live." It was good catching up. I understand. I'm not saying I won't do it. But hear me out... I've already booked the caterer for 200 people. Right? No, but... But... No... Should I renegotiate the whole deal? Yes, exactly. I'll call back in half an hour. No, I will, for sure. I need to go. Just give me a moment! This woman's been chewing my ear off for an hour. Tell me. She's adding the groom's colleagues to the list. Everyone takes advantage of my politeness. The guest list keeps increasing, like ants emerging from a wall. You're not making it easier, either. I've been telling you for days! Look at my ceiling... It looks so ugly. I've been at your door since noon. But Sushant's naps are deeper than our sleep at night! No amount of pounding can wake him up! I don't have the time to solve every problem! I have a wedding to plan. There are guests at home. This makes me look so bad. Isn't it your house, too? Fix your sink right away. -Here, call my plumber. -No... -Plumber-- -I'll get it fixed tomorrow. Don't worry. -Do you promise? -Yes. Swear on my life! Trust me, I'll do it tomorrow. I'll die if you don't! -What are you saying? -You've been promising for days. -I'll get it done. -Fine. You know I can't depend on Sushant, and I'm swamped. Don't whine. I do enough of it. Go on. Did you buy spinach today? Why is the door open? Dad left it open. That's four. Hey, little one. Hey, little one. Don't call me that. How long has the water been leaking? Did Dad see it? It was there before I got back from school. Dad saw it, but he ignored it, and threw a wet towel at me. And he left the bathroom lights on. Sameer, why are the board game pieces scattered all over? The Jed from Scrabble was on the bed. It's worth ten points! Mom, it's Zed. Not Jed. I know, I know. And why is this chess piece in the pencil box? And sharpen pencils over the garbage can. This house looks like a garbage can. -It's dinner time. -It's the last one! Did you throw this bill? Dad spilled tea on himself. He used the bill as a towel and chucked it on the ground. Bro, we need seven points. Let's get it done. Don't chase the Queen for extra points. He knows what to do. Don't instruct him. What's your problem? He's on my team. Some people need their hand held through life, Aunty. Right, Aunty? What do you mean? -Why are you playing so slowly? -And what's so funny? Answer me, Dinesh. Your turn. -Play. -Speak freely. About what? I've been noticing your jibes for days. What's the matter? Do you think you did all the work? Do you? We were partners, right? So? Who did all the work? I picked up the slack. -I found the clients. -Really? I made the deals. I followed up. What the hell did you do? Bastard, I brought in 19 of the 25 clients. You've forgotten? My former colleagues, my contacts at Uber, my share-trading contacts... You barely managed a handful. Yeah, because I've only had one stable job for the last several years. Unlike you, I haven't been job-hopping every few months. If your job is so great, why did you go into business with me? Just play. Enough. Let's play. Anju must have given him an earful, Aunty. -He's taking his frustrations out on me. -Let it go. Fuck the game. Let's leave. Hang on. Why did he bring Anju into this? -So what? -Shall I bring your wife into it? -Careful, Dinesh. -Sorry, I forgot. He's the wife here. Sarita wears the pants in the house. -Fancy yourself a comedian? -It's the truth... Fancy yourself a comedian? Don't touch me. -Stop me, then! -You're... Stop me, then! You're crossing the line, Sushant. -You're the wife. -That's too much. -You're crossing the line. -Why do you hide when she's back? Bastard! Dad! -Dad! -What? What is it? Mom is calling you. I'll be right there. Go. You go, I'll come. Leave. It's nothing. Go on. Go on. You go. Go. Your husband's back after a long day. Just shut up! -Have you lost it? -Yes, I have! Dad! I've told you to be home by nine o'clock. The food is cold now. That's why we have a stove. Be like Modi. Yes, you heard right. Eat mushrooms and... Reddy's been calling me all day. ...the secret to Modi's good health and agility. Why did he call you? When will you pay him back? How did you know I owe him money? Your friends only call me when you owe them money. It's not a debt. Just a few thousand. I'll return it. Did you ask Dinesh about your commission? Eat mushrooms and become like Modi. Come on, Sarita. We've had potatoes three times this week. Eat mushrooms and become like Modi. Can't you find other vegetables at the market? Or paneer, maybe? Potatoes for a couch potato. Be more, you'll get more. Dad's a potato. Ladies and gentlemen, our next participant is Sarita Sahastrabuddhe. 9:25 It smells so good. Hurry up. I'm starving. Sushant! Yes, Tai. Don't cook today. I'm bringing you some curry. LONG LIFE INSURANCE Excuse me. I'm here to see Mr. Govardan. Sure, please have a seat. It's okay. I'll stand. Sir, there's a... -What's your name? -Sushant. Dinesh's partner. Sir, Sushant is here. Dinesh's business partner. What brings you here? -I'm here to collect my commission. -Sir, he's here for his check. -Okay. -Your partner picked it up yesterday. Please, coordinate with him. -How could he take it? -Okay, sir. We're equal partners! That's my half! Why did you hand him all of it? I need to talk to Mr. Govardan. He's busy in another meeting. He can't meet you-- He's right there. I can see him. I want to meet him. I'm not here to beg. I want what I'm owed. Let me meet him! Dinesh! Why are you pounding on the door, Sushant? -Where is Dinesh? -The doorbell works-- -Where is he? -Dinesh isn't home. Oh, is that so? -Where's he hiding? -He really isn't. -You think I'm stupid? -What? Did you just cuss at me? You're a fool. I told you he isn't home. Where is he hiding? He's not here! -Really? -What? -What is this, then? -What? What is this? You should have hidden his briefcase. His bike is parked outside. Foolish! He took a rickshaw today. -Really? -Yes. He took another bag. Are you even listening to me? -What? -Stop this nonsense. -Come back at night. -Alright, fine. Okay. -Find a better excuse by then. -Yeah, sure! I'll see you. Are you okay? -Did he leave? -Yeah. Tell Dad to call the plumber. "Tell Dad to call the plumber." My friends are coming over tomorrow. "My friends are coming over tomorrow." Ask him to clean up the place and come back late. -"Ask him to clean up the place--" -Ask Mom to get off my back. "Ask Mom to get off my back." Always giving instructions! "Always giving instructions!" Enough, Sameer. Okay, Mom. Bingo is the game for you. The next lucky number is two! It's not my day! I haven't found a single number. Oh, the tea is here! That shady guy who lives upstairs is always sneaking in and out. No one knows what he's up to. Who? Mr. Rajendra? Yeah. What's his deal? Ladies, the next number is three! Still no luck. He's the Private Assistant to a politician. Private Assistant? What private business takes him away for days on end? Hey! The next number is 16! Ah! Well done, son! Pick out my number, too! Plumber. Tea leaves, rice... Do you dump everything in here? I'm not the only one who makes tea. Move these plates. I need a closer look. -I'll do it. -Move! Go be with your friends. Move. You'll make it worse. Move! I was trying... The plate slipped. Sweet. Have you lost your mind? The bottle could've hit his head. Don't fake concern. There's no audience here. Now he wants to be a parent! I made it clear. I said, come back after my friends leave, keep the house clean, and don't bring the plumber. Excuse me, you didn't say a word about the plumber! -One second-- -You just asked me-- You just asked me to keep the house clean, and I did. I can't even tell the truth with the confidence with which you lie! Why would I lie? -Why would I? -Am I lying? Am I? Sameer. -My little one. -Let him sleep. Are you scared of being exposed? Little one. -Sameer. -Sameer. Wake up. -Listen to me... -No, listen to me! -Hold on a second! -You hold on! Yesterday, remember I told Dad about my friends coming over? I said, tidy up, come home late, and don't bring the plumber. -She never mentioned the plumber, right? -I did, right? -She didn't mention the plumber, did she? -I did, right? -Try to remember. -She told me about her friends. -But that's it, right? -Hold on! Sushant! -Let me talk to him! -Let him hear what I'm saying! Why are you shouting? Try to remember, Sameer! -You were repeating what we were saying. -Yeah, he was repeating it. Exactly. Yeah, he remembers. And what did you repeat? About her friends, the house... -Nothing about a plumber. -You always play Candy Crush. Do you even listen to me? Why bring Candy Crush into this? Because you never listen to me! I do. That's how I know you're lying. But do you pay attention? -Of course I do. -No, you don't. -You didn't mention the plumber! -I did! -Admit it's your fault! -Hang on. Stop screaming! Sameer! Sarita. Is everything okay between the two of you? I mean... Neeta was talking about it. She wasn't gossiping. She was concerned. It's nothing. Everyone is talking. Everyone knows. You were both happy when you first moved in. Sushant would play the guitar, on our birthdays. You would sing... so beautifully. Right? Then something happened, because of the reality show. These things happen. Something changed after that. Right? He stopped playing, you stopped singing. Why? Money, Tai. In our house, it starts there and ends there. But you have a government job. It's a government bank. You must make a good salary. A steady 25 to 30 thousand. That's a steady income. But steady doesn't cut it. I'm tired of Sushant's indifference. He hasn't been able to keep one job in five years. Sometimes he drives for Uber, sometimes he sells insurance with Dinesh. He's given up on his music. I gave up my dreams so he could fulfil his. Yes. I slog at the bank so that he can write his music. But he isn't even trying. He had nobody in Bangalore. He moved to Mumbai because of me. He would depend on me for auditions, meetings and everything else. That time, on the Shining Star show... The lights came on and... the audience was staring at me. I just choked. I couldn't find my voice. It happens... He's been punishing me ever since. He's put pictures of me on stage all over the house. I feel like the pictures are mocking me. They remind me of that day. Have you talked to him about it? It's like talking to a wall. Sarita... Then you have to break that wall, brick by brick. Express your feelings. Take me, for example. I was too shy to express myself. I'm all alone now. -Please get me some tea. -Okay. CLOSE When you edit the wedding video, don't use lame Bollywood songs. What do you prefer? EDM? Be quiet. I'll deal with it. -How? -Stop telling them what to pick, Niru. You can't even pick a nail paint. Changes her mind five times a day. Don't listen to her. She just wants to show off. Here's your payment. She's even picked a groom who would look good in a suit! Have you thought of a hashtag for the wedding? Hashtag? Yeah! We're using "Jana" from my name and "Gana" from his. #JanaGana That's perfect! -That's cool. -The National Anthem. So patriotic. -Shall we? -My tea... -Tai? -Yeah. Don't worry. -You'll have the best wedding video! -Let's go. -I promise. -Okay. Stress-free! It's genuine currency. Why were you suspicious? The man who deposited them looked suspicious. He didn't look like a wealthy man. You can't judge a man by his looks these days. My milkman has an iPhone. He laughs at my old phone. Listen... I heard that you used to sing. Ladies and Gentleman, please welcome our next participant, Sarita Sahastrabuddhe, to the stage. Shining Star Listen... To the fables That the tunes weave together Pick... The fallible heroes Make them your narrator The lights went on! The audience is visible. I didn't turn them on. You can turn it off, can't you? Come, come... Sarita, continue. What do you want? Why are you following me? Coffee? Hello, Mom. The trains were packed. I missed two before I got one. Little one! Hey, little one! Sushant... He just stepped out to buy a new broom. Here, talk to your grandma. Hello, Grandma. Yeah. Dad is always at home! He has nowhere else to be. I do more work than him. -Shall we go? -Yeah. -Are you coming? -Yes. Hello? Hello, madam. This is Reddy. -Please don't-- -Listen, madam... We're way beyond courtesies now. You said your husband would call. Why are you calling me? I don't want to beg for my own money. Very sad. I'm afraid my sadness will turn to rage. Can you fix my shoe? Let me see. It'll be five bucks. If it breaks again, I'll come back for my money. It won't, Granny. Bastard! Who are you calling "Granny"? -I'm just 61. -I'm sorry. -Don't call me "Granny!" -Okay, I'll fix it. Get to it. I'll be back. Reddy texted today. To thank me. The text said... "Thank you. Sarita returned 8,000." You've already applied lipstick. He agreed not to tell you. That's why he sent a text. He wants to insult me by telling me that my wife's repaying my debts. You helped him do it. Let's fight later. Okay? Bring me the vermilion from the bathroom. Damned if you help, damned if you don't! It's not in here. You keep it on the flush tank? Isn't it fitting? Sarita, don't joke about it. I'm serious. Okay, don't get mad. I'm taking the keys. We'll talk about it later. Put it back there. Tai, I heard someone talking about a stash of cash. Do you know anything about this? Really? Never mind. I must have heard wrong. Probably. I'll bring tea. If they tease you If they tease you for being too decked out Just blush and play the shy card Just blush and play the shy card You turned out to be Quite a seasoned player You turned out to be Quite a seasoned player We thought you were a naysayer You turned out to be Quite a seasoned player You turned out to be Quite a seasoned player You turned out to be Quite a seasoned player And all set to say, "I do" And all set to say, "I do" And all set to say, "I do" That's enough. I have to leave now. -No, you can't. I'm not done yet. -I'll finish later. Sarita, you can't go. You have to sing with us now. Come on, let's get started. Sharvari has told us you sing very well. -Come on, sing. -That's enough. I'm going. Wait, Sarita... Hang on, Sarita. Hang on, Sarita. Sarita... You're leaving already? It's really late, Tai. -Your henna is incomplete. -No, it's okay. But hang on... What's the rush? -Look at the tantrum she just threw. -Sarita... Stop this! Aunty? -Why can't you hold your tongue? -Hey, come on. I told you not to force her to sing. She wasn't throwing a tantrum. She has performance anxiety. It's all drama. Her eyes were on the clock. There's something else going on with her. I'll show you what's on her mind. Look. I've forwarded it to Mrs. Joshi and Anju. -Oh my God! -What is it? Will you defend her even now? Don't show me this nonsense. Veggies are easily digested. Chips constipate you. I Googled it. Shut up, Sameer! You're constantly spouting trivia! You're on Google all day, even when you should be doing homework-- There's no water in the bathroom. The tap is making weird noises. Either you call your plumber, or I'll call mine! Sameer, pack up your lunch and come out. I keep saying it: learn to look around you. Wash up. Move. Listen... Where did you get the money to repay my debt? Mom returned some money she'd borrowed last year. Hurry up, Sameer. Hurry. Hurry up and get our bags. Dinesh! Dinesh! What should we get Niru for her wedding? A little cash in an envelope should do. That will do. Don't be stingy. I'm always borrowing stuff from Tai. Sushant, she does so much for us. She's family. A little cash won't suffice. We will have to give at least two thousand. Two thousand? Yeah. So? As a gift? It's a wedding. So? Are you really so flush with money, that you have money left over, even after settling my debt? Mom gave me 15,000. I wonÂ three thousand at bingo the other day. After paying Reddy eight thousand I still have 10 thousand left. You still have 10,000 left? Yeah, so? Would you stand by and let me starve, while your plate is full? I could clear up my debt with Reddy! Sarita! Sarita! How could he do this? Do what? I've lost everything! -Lost what? -What happened? You... You don't know? You don't? -Don't you? -No. The 500... -What? -What? The 500 note is gone. -Gone where? -The 1,000 notes are also gone. -What? -He's discontinued it. -Who did? -Hey... Modi. Modi who? What are you saying? We have decided that the 500 and 1,000 currency notes presently in use will no longer be legal tender from midnight tonight. Brilliant! Now all the dirty money will be flushed out. ...of 500 or 1,000. That's a great leader! ...in the bank... I told you good days will come! Come on, let's go Come on, let's go Come on, let's go Come on, let's go Let's dance, rock and freak Come on, come on, come on Come on, come on Now, you come Beat, beat, beat Beat on those drums Don't, don't, don't Don't try to spin stories Now it's me, me, me Now I am like your friend With folded dhoti And exposed undershorts Drinking liquor and dancing freely Come on, come to dance, come on Come on Come to dance, come on DO THESE PEOPLE HAVE DIRTY MONEY? To dance, come on To freak out and dance Come on, dear, come on Come on, let's go. Me! Come on, let's go. You! Come on! Come to dance, come on Come on Me! You! Open the shutters. Get in line! Why can't I withdraw more? Is this genuine currency? It's real. Does it have a microchip? Next! You can't withdraw 80,000. You'll only get 4,000. Show me an ID. Stay in line. Security! -The guard is not here. -Security! -Get in line! -Behave yourselves! Stay in line! Take it easy! -Madam! -I'll be back in a minute. -Sir. -Yeah? We're running out of the new currency notes. What do we do? Move aside, please. Excuse me. Security, pull down the shutters. One moment. One moment. Please stay calm. Don't panic. Those in here can withdraw money. All of you will get money. Please leave by the back door. Alright? Please cooperate. Please... Hey! -Come with me. -Okay, sir. Excuse me. Shailesh, stand right here. -Let them out one at a time. -Okay, sir. Hello, Mr. Patil. This is Sahni, the Branch Manager. We have a huge problem here. Please send additional forces. There's a large mob here. They're getting violent. It's been ten days since the demonetization announcement. People are lining up on the streets. They are cash-strapped. Regular life has come to a standstill. But there's a silver lining... -We're really lucky, Aunty. -Yeah. We're witnessing the Modi magic, live. He gave up his domestic life and lived like a hermit in the Himalayas, all so he could bring us good days. ....the funding for terrorist groups has dried up. Banning 500 and 1,000 notes has foiled their devious plans. ...all operations run from Delhi... Terrorists and Naxalites are facing the heat. Note ban has affected terrorists... Did you know Modi lived a hermit's life in the Himalayas? Yeah. He also made tea and swept floors. I'd be happy if you did either. He left his wife, for the sake of the nation. You're welcome to do that, too. That'll give me peace of mind. What is your problem with Modi? Modi isn't my problem. You are, Sushant! The scenes at the bank are killing me. The yelling, the crying... I work for hours and then come home to this mess. I don't have time to think about the Prime Minister! And you have nothing but time! Here, clean this mess. Become the Prime Minister! Sushant! Sushant! Sushant! Sushant! Sushant! Sushant! Hurry up. Wait at the gate, and I'll come. What if the bus arrives? Then get in and go, like you usually do. Be a little independent! Tai? Tai... Sarita! The wedding planner called. He wants payment in the new banknotes. The same with the caterer and the band. -I'm scrambling to find the cash. Help me! -Tai... Sameer is at the bus stop. -The wedding must go on. -Call me after four o'clock. I will lose face if the wedding is called off! Sarita! Okay, I'll call at 4:00 p.m. Turn off the stove. Got rid of all your dirty money? Bro, I'm not rich enough to qualify for dirty money. Demonetization is for corrupt assholes who usurp our share. Now they are shit scared, queuing outside the banks, begging for money. Are you okay, bro? What do you mean? I mean, with you and your wife? Why wouldn't I be? What is it? It's all drama. -She was watching the clock. -What are they talking about? -Something else is going on with her. -She's just worried about work. I'll show you what she's thinking about. Look. -I'll show you. -What is it? I've forwarded it to Mrs. Joshi and Anju. -Look. -What is it? Watch. You won't believe it. What video is Aunty showing them? I couldn't sneak up behind them. Remember I told you? Go ask Aunty. Aunty's gone away. She'll return in a week. Move. Shall I show you what's on her mind? Shall I? What? What is it? I've forwarded it to Mrs. Joshi and Anju. -Look at this. -What is it? Neeta Aunty! -Did you just call me "Aunty"? -Sorry. -I wanted to ask you something. -Go ahead. At Niru's henna ceremony, you showed everyone a video, right? Huh? Right after Sarita left. I didn't see anything. And I don't meddle in other people's business. Please, ma'am. I live alone. I can't walk to the bank every day. Aunty, the daily limit is 4,000. Watch the news. All banks have the same rule. Please, don't do this to me. What am I to do? Come back tomorrow. Banks dole out cash, not sympathy. Get help from the people you elected. Next. Lunchtime. Let me eat at least. -Let's go. -Yes. What are you looking for? What? I think I forgot my lunch at home. I must have forgotten it in a huff. -Don't worry, we can share. -Okay. This sari keeps bunching up. Sushant? You forgot your lunch this morning. My husband would never bring my lunch to work! He'd eat it himself. He wouldn't bring it to me. He must have had some work in the area, so he brought it here. -But at least he brought it here. -Exactly. Wives never appreciate their husbands. Mr. Sahni, this is Sushant. Sushant, Mr. Sahni. -Hi, sir. -Hello. So, you are the lucky man. How did you land our gold-star employee? I came to fetch a plumber that Gopal recommended. I came to fetch him. But he's closed his shop to go join the queue outside his bank. I spoke to Mr. Joshi. I found a cheaper plumber. I'm trying to help. Please just let me... -Do you hate me? -No. Will you be late tonight? Yes. Shall I make dinner? Is there something you want to tell me? Like what? Anything... Let's wrap up. There's a long queue outside the bank. You can tell me anything. Is there something you want to tell me? Why do you talk to me in that way? I take it, but... It's your job, your plumber, your bank, your money. -Everything revolves around you. -Okay. Don't blame me for anything later on. Okay. You won't find another man like me. All good? Yeah, let's go. I'll be late. Are you okay? My throat is a little sore. -My throat is-- -You seem unwell. What's up? Carry on. I'll catch up. The lines at the bank are impossible. A guy I know has been waiting four days to get in. You work at a bank. So, we can help each other. I'll forgive Sushant's loan. What do you want from me? I'll tell you. I have an exchange scheme at my hotel. I charge a 40% commission to exchange old currency. 300 for 500, 600 for 1,000. I can source the new notes. No problem. I need a way to deposit the old currency. We can share the profits. 60-40. I will give you 40% of my profits. -There she is. -There she is. -You open the door. I'll wait inside. -Okay. Sarita? Yeah? Tai... What's wrong? -Sarita. -Yeah? I called you. You didn't answer. The bridegroom's family want to postpone the wedding. The invites have gone out, the contracts are in... I don't know how I can postpone. What are you looking at? The daily limit keeps changing. I don't understand. What should I do? Should I fight the decorator, pacify the in-laws, or queue up at the banks hoping against hope? I have 80,000 in cash, in the old currency. Just help me get 50,000 in the new currency, and I can make some payments. I know someone... He'll give you 300 for 500, and 600 for 1,000. That will work. Dinesh! Open up! I know you're in there. Dinesh! -Sushant? -Where's the money? Money? Where's my money? Thought you could run away? You're the one who takes off with people's money. I have your money. It's safe. Let go of me! Let go of me! Give me the money. It's all there. Count it. Where's Anju? She stayed in Nasik. She's unwell. I need to speak with her. About what? It's private. Anju and I have no secrets. -Don't taunt me again! -Get off me. Anju has a video of Sarita. What video? Sarita, with another man-- Are you nuts? You're talking about Sarita in this way? Just tell her to send-- An idle mind is the Devil's workshop. -Get a job. -I need to see that video. -You're crazy. Just count the money. -You've given me the old notes. Sarita. Dinesh gave me my money. But they're old notes. I need to exchange them. I'll do it. Thank you. I have a job interview at Amit Trivedi's studio tomorrow. What kind of job? Whatever he wants me to do. You want me to work, right? What I want to do is irrelevant. If he wants tea, I'll make it. If he needs his floors swept, I'll do it. Stay calm. Everyone will be served. I respect women. I can't help you. It wasn't a request. I was telling you it's your duty. You don't have a choice. For now... deposit 50,000 in your account. I don't have an account at this branch. I said, deposit the money in your account, not at this branch. This is the chance of a lifetime. Demonetization... only happens once every 50 years. People are launching new companies. So many new companies. I might not have a lot of clout, but I'm not standing in long queues like a nobody. Just a small transaction. Take it. Here, take it. For today, 50,000. See you tomorrow. Same time, same place. It's secluded enough. Okay? I am going far away You will be left all alone You will be left all alone Thank you so much, everyone. HAPPY RETIREMENT But especially... Sarita. Sarita, you are supposed to be here. With me. Come. Please come. Sarita, you must sing along with me. Who are you? Dad! Mom wants you home. They are Tai's guests. From Kolhapur. She asked if they could stay here. I agreed. They're in the living room. It's not a problem. I'll do it. Feeling alright? She's exhausted. Maybe they are trying for another child. What happened? Feeling sick again? Why are you sleeping in the kitchen? The fan was on high-speed in there. I couldn't handle it. I'll go. Just a minute. Sarita, why did you turn off the fan? Sarita! I want tea. Some tea. What? Tea. Stay put. Sameer's lunch. Your food. Tea. Tai's guests can eat at her place. Here are your snacks. Move. Why are you locking the door? The men with money Are shouting at the top of their voices Are shouting at the top of their voices They've laid out traps Careful, when you roll the dice Try to expose them And they'll change the topic Hide their shame with shrouds of opulence With shrouds of opulence Hide their shame Hide their shame Hide their shame with shrouds of opulence The world is a Babel of riches Everything rounds up to the coin Money speaks the loudest Money speaks the loudest Money speaks the loudest Money speaks the loudest Money speaks the loudest What does money say?

Sameer has gotten heavy. It's hard to carry him. You could have carried him. Your accounts don't mention your mom's money, or the bingo money. You went through my purse? Money is flowing like water here. There are new things around the house. New flowerpots, cushion covers, curtains... Where is this money coming from? Who's giving you the money? The Phillips food processor you gifted today... It costs 5,599! Why isn't it accounted for? -I've been busy. Don't overreact! -Oh, really? So, you're that busy? Yeah, I'm busy. My workload has increased since demonetization was introduced. This is from yesterday. You've accounted for a packet of salt! From the other day: Rickshaw fare - 25. Chocolate for Sameer - 10. Wait. There's more... You've even written... Lemons - 5, and the vendor has a 2 balance. A woman who accounts for 2, cannot possibly forget to write down a gift worth 5,599! Pick him up. I can't do it. -Answer me, Sarita. -Get away from me, Sushant! A gift worth 5,599! Where is the money coming from? Have you had it lying around? You wouldn't understand, Sushant. This dump finally looks like a home. Okay, fine. But explain something to me. When you knew I had a loan to repay, you spent 5,599 on a gift instead? I'd much rather do that! If I paid off all your debts, we would starve. When you start contributing to this household, you'll have the right to question me. So, only you care about our situation? Don't I worry about money? My parents might not be rich like yours, but I give you a portion to put towards the expenses every month. That's nothing. You give me 2,000. The same amount for the last ten years! Sameer is older and the rent has doubled! Your 2,000 doesn't even cover the groceries, Sushant. You fool! -And don't drag my parents into this! -What did you say? At least they don't beg for train fare when they visit, like your parents. -My parents don't beg, they borrow! -Move! -They're poor, but honest. -Get lost! Not like your dad! A junior officer in the Water Department, who can afford to drive such a fancy car. He's taken bribes from under and over the table! So what? Why are you jealous? At least he doesn't blame others for his failures. Idiot! Open the door! If you're still doubting me, just call Mom! Ask her all your questions. At least that way, you'll talk to her. She won't bite! Why are you up, Sameer? Go to sleep! We were talking! The government has announced all old demonetized currency has to be exchanged by tomorrow. The deadline will not be extended beyond midnight. No exceptions will be made for medical bills, water... Rutu said you left early. I called the bank. You weren't there. Where were you? Someone has to actually buy the food you eat. Why do you always snap at me? I know you're lying. I know everything. Yes! Go out and finish your homework, Sameer. -Mom... -Hurry up. You have school tomorrow. -Please, Mom! -Go do your homework outside. Sarita, the laundry guy is here. I've left the laundry pile on the chair. And remind him that he still has a balance of 10. Yes, madam. I have to pay him now. Yeah, pay him. Please repay Reddy as soon as you can. I can report you to the cops. That's okay, madam. I won't do what you want. I didn't even deposit the money you gave me earlier. Sarita, I don't think you love your husband enough. You're right. Sort it out with him. You don't know what I'm capable of doing-- Hey! Hang on. Let go of me! Stay away from her! You don't know what I'm capable of. You want your money, right? Here... Two, four, six, eight, ten! With interest! I don't want to work for you and I don't want your money! Sir, he bypassed the queue. He was threatening a bank employee. Sarita, you go in. I'll take care of it. Go. What happened back there? Was it a fight? What happened? Why aren't you answering me? Saru, say something. No, not that. Listen... To the fables That the tunes weave together Pick The fallible heroes Make them your narrator Listen To the fables That the tunes weave together Pick... The fallible heroes Make them your narrator Every story you tell me Sounds like a sweet surprise The rhythm of your laughter That alone will suffice You and I can never be out of sync All our tiffs Will only strengthen the bond All our tiffs Will only strengthen the bond All our tiffs Will only strengthen the bond Bring me the lyrics And I'll make it my song Give me your voice And I'll string it along Then, on a whim, ask me to forget it all Then, on a whim, ask me to forget it all Everything you say has a sweet ring to it You're the wind beneath my wings You're the wind beneath my wings You and I can never be out of sync All our tiffs Will only strengthen the bond All our tiffs Will only strengthen the bond All our tiffs Will only strengthen the bond Why are you crying? What's the matter? I just can't win. Why do you say that? I couldn't become a singer. I choked on stage. I lost the competition. And the money. Why do I always lose? Think of it as a rehearsal. Okay? When it's time for the real show, you'll win! Listen. Sarita. You will win. You're a winner. Please don't cry. I promise... It'll be alright. Another private assistant of this politician has been arrested. They found suitcases full of new notes at his house. Was this on the news? Not on TV. I have my own sources. The police are after the politician. Check the news. He has a total of six personal assistants! Think of all the cash he's stashing! Sarita Pillai? I think he panicked and got caught. I'm glad you told me about it. I withdrew some extra money. Good thing you did. Tai. -Dinesh? -Yes, it's me. -Anju? -Open up! What's going on? -Come to the balcony, I'll show you. -What? The police are here! Speak softly. They went to Sushant and Sarita's. -Why? -What do you... Where do you think Sarita got all that money from? Those notes that were stolen from her bank account... Oh, God! Are you sure? Softly. I had no idea it was the same money. The bank robbers were caught. They posted a selfie which went viral on WhatsApp. And the police traced them. It went viral. Right. Right. The notes stolen from you... were from the first batch of minting. According to the Reserve Bank's records, they were delivered to the local politician's constituency. Maybe someone from that constituency deposited them at my branch. Listen, you're in the clear. We're not arresting you. Some politicians and their associates are on our radar. They knew that the demonetization announcement was coming. They colluded with bankers and exchanged their money beforehand. What are you looking for? Tai... We've arrested the banker in Kolhapur. We have the serial numbers of the notes. We just need to know if he deposited the money himself, or if he sent one of his men. How did you get hold of this money? -Sir-- -I found those notes, sir. Sorry? In these pouches. Is this all or is there more? That's all I have right now. Where did you find the pouches? Downstairs. What do you mean? There's a drain downstairs. There may be more pouches now. Can you show us? There's one more pouch. Put it in there. Let's not be greedy. We'll get caught. We're needy. They're greedy! -Yeah, but... -Here, take this... Is that your house? No, sir. That's Ms. Sharvari Tai's house. I live above her. Dinesh and Anju stay on the ground floor. Mr. Rajendra lives on the top floor. He's the politician's P.A. Fine. Take us to his house. Sure. Sarita. Hey! This way, sir. How are you? Hey! This is his house. When was the last time you saw him? -Before the demonetization announcement. -Okay. Fine, you may go. Take his details. Sushant, where were you? -Okay, we're leaving now. -See you. Is someone here? They're from the Tax department. Why were they here? They are searching Rajendra's house. I see. Anyway, take care of Sarita. If you need help, let me know. That's what good neighbors do. I'm here for you too, okay? Okay? -Let's go. -Okay. It was meant to be a surprise. Sameer, careful. Sarita! Sarita! You won! What do you mean? The income tax department sent a letter. We helped them trace that dirty money last year, remember? -We received a reward for that! -Seriously? -Read it. -Let me read it. "Ten percent of the confiscated sum is bestowed upon Sushant Pillai." Sushant! -They took down my details back then. -Right. The letter says I have to go collect the money. How much is it? Huh?
