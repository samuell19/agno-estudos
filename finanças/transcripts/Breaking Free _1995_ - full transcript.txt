THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL ANIMAL. AN APPALOOSA. HUMMM. COSMO'S GREAT!! YEAH? YEAH. ME AND MY OLD GIRLFRIEND USED TO FIGHT OVER WHO TOOK THE QUIZ FIRST. WILL THERE BE ANYTHING ELSE? YEAH, SOME GUM. DON'T MOVE! RICHARD CHILTON. YOU HAVE A BIRTHDAY IN A FEW MONTHS. DOESN'T EVERYBODY? YOU'LL BE 18 IN AUGUST. YOU'RE ALMOST TOO OLD FOR JUVIE HALL. WHERE I'M HEADED MAKES JUVIE LOOK LIKE A WALK IN THE PARK. I'VE HEARD IT. I HOPE YOU NEVER HAVE TO SEE IT. CHILTON, NO SIESTAS ON MY TIME. I GREW UP ON A RANCH. MY OLD MAN WAS A HORSE TRAINER. I KNOW MORE ABOUT HORSES THAN I DO ABOUT PEOPLE. I KNOW HOW TO GIVE THEM SHOTS, SHOE 'EM, BREAK 'EM. LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING RECENTLY. YOU'VE RUN AWAY FROM 3 FOSTER HOMES, YOU HAVE 4 COUNTS OF VANDALISM, AND NOW, THIS CONVENIENCE STORE FIASCO. THE WORK RELEASE PROGRAM IS FOR SOMEONE WHO'S PROVEN THEMSELVES RESPONSIBLE. THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE YOU, DOES IT? I JUST WANT A CHANCE. WHY? SO YOU CAN GET TO KIDDIE CAMP AND BAIL? ALL RIGHT. NICE TRY...., FOR AN OLD GUY. YOU'RE A SHRINK. SHOULDN'T YOU SAY, "MATURITY CHALLENGED?" I'M POLITICALLY INCORRECT AND PROUD OF IT. YEAH. COME ON, LET'S WARM THE BENCH. HEY. HEY. HOW ARE YOU DOING? I'M DOING FINE, ANNIE, HOW ARE YOU? AH, WELL, I'M IN TROUBLE. I NEED A NEW STABLE HAND. WHAT ABOUT THAT WORK RELEASE PROGRAM? YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE SOMEBODY FOR ME. WELL, THERE IS ONE KID... YEAH... BUT, HE'S NOT RIGHT. TWENTY MINUTES AT YOUR CAMP AND HE'D HIT THE PAVEMENT. YOU CAN'T SAY THAT AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY. KIDS LIVE UP TO THE EXPECTATIONS OTHER PEOPLE HAVE OF THEM. HERE IT COMES. HOW IS HE EVER GOING TO MAKE A DECENT LIFE FOR HIMSELF IF YOU TELL HIM HE DOESN'T DESERVE ONE? YOUR POLITICAL INCORRECTNESS IS FADING. DOES HE HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH HORSES? YEAH. OH, COME ON, THEN. BUT, YOU DON'T WANT THIS GUY AROUND YOUR KIDS. WE'LL HIRE HIM ON A TRIAL BASIS. IF HE SCREWS UP, HE'S OUTTA THERE. THE UNSINKABLE IDEALIST. INSTEAD OF TEARING PEOPLE DOWN, TRY TO BUILD THEM UP. IT GETS BETTER RESULTS. ALL RIGHT, LETS GO OVER THE RULES. RULE NUMBER ONE: [ mumbles ] WHAT? NO DRINKING. RULE NUMBER TWO: NO SMOKING. RULE NUMBER THREE: NO LEAVING CAMP WITHOUT PERMISSION. WHAT HAPPENS ONCE A WEEK? DINNER AND A MOVIE? WEEKLY REVIEW. [ horse whinnies ] EXCELLENT! COOL SHADES, MAN. CAN I TRY THEM ON? SUNLIGHT HURTS HIS EYES, SOMETIMES. AHH, TIED ONE ON LAST NIGHT? I UNDERSTAND. ANNIE, HI. HEY! MEET THE NEW STABLE HAND. HI. I'M ANNIE. IT'S GREAT TO HAVE YOU HERE. THANKS. THIS IS THE NEW STABLE HAND? ONE OF YOUR GUYS? YEAH. RICK CHILTON, THIS IS CLAY NELSON. CLAY'S OUR HEAD COUNSELOR. RICK GREW UP ON HORSES. HIS DAD WAS A TRAINER. REALLY? FOR WHOM? THESE KIDS HERE... THEY'RE ALL... THEY'RE ALL BLIND. THANKS FOR TELLING HIM. [ bell rings ] THAT'S LUNCH. IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME. GOOD LUCK. I GOTTA GET GOING, TOO. I'LL SEE YOU IN A WEEK, WON'T I? SURE THING, MACK. BYE, MACK. BYE. COME ON, I'LL SHOW YOU WHERE YOU'LL STAY. DOING GOOD, STEPH! WHAT IS THAT, A METAL DETECTOR? THAT'S WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE. THAT IS A MOWACS SENSOR. IT PUTS OUT SOUND ULTRA WAVES, THEY BOUNCE OFF OBJECTS, AND THE SENSOR VIBRATES. SORTA LIKE AN UPDATED VERSION OF THE WALKING CANE. EXACTLY. WE WANT THE KIDS TO BE AS INDEPENDENT AND UP TO DATE AS POSSIBLE. OUR TACK SEEMS TO HAVE DISAPPEARED INTO THE LAND OF LOST SOCKS, BUT, FORTUNATELY WE'LL BE GETTING MORE FROM THE MORRIS RANCH SOON. OKAY, HERE'S WHERE YOU'LL STAY. LINENS ARE IN THE CLOSET YOUR BATHROOM IS ALL THE WAY DOWNSTAIRS. SORRY. IT'S NOT THE RITZ BUT... NO, IT'S GREAT. I HAVEN'T HAD MY OWN ROOM SINCE I WAS A KID. WELL, I'LL LET YOU SETTLE IN. DON'T YOU WANT ME TO RECITE THE RULES OR SOMETHING? I'D RATHER SEE YOU FOLLOW THEM. CONSIDER THEM FOLLOWED. [ music playing ] [ horse galloping ] UHHHH! I'M RIGHT HERE, LILLIAN. I'M RIGHT HERE. PUT HIM DOWN. SHE SLIPPED THE STIRRUP, MR. MORRIS, THAT'S ALL. I SAID PUT HIM DOWN. AND DO IT BEFORE I GET BACK! CAL, WOULD YOU PLEASE FIND SOMETHING TO DO? BUSTER! I PUT GHOST IN THE BACK, MR. MORRIS. I THOUGHT YOU NEEDED A FEW DAYS TO COOL OFF. FROM NOW ON, I'LL DEAL WITH THAT HORSE. [ car pulls up ] IT'S BEAUTIFUL HERE. GET OUT AND SMELL THE AIR. I CAN SMELL FINE FROM IN HERE. LINDSAY, GET OUT OF THE CAR. I DON'T WANT TO GO. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SIT AND MOPE THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. IT'S MY LIFE. LINDSAY, THIS CAMP HAS THE BEST MOBILITY TRAINING AROUND. THAT'S SWELL, MOM. I HOPE YOU HAVE A REALLY GREAT TIME. MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T PUSH HER. THEN SHE'LL NEVER LEARN TO COPE. IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT? WHAT ARE YOU DOING? LET GO OF ME! LEAVE ME ALONE! HEY, SAY HELLO TO LINDSAY KURTZ, EVERYONE. [ Together: ] HI, LINDSAY. YOU CAN SIT RIGHT HERE. YOUR MILK'S AT TEN O'CLOCK. BILLY, YOU'RE REALLY BECOMING A WHIZ AT THAT OPTICON. THAT WHAT? BILLY'S OPTICON. IT'S A READING DEVICE. WHEN BILLY'S PASSES THE OPTICON OVER PAGES, IT TRANSPOSES THE WORDS ONTO A RUBBER PAD. THEN HE READS THE RAISED LETTERS LIKE BRAILLE. OH. NOW, IF WE COULD GET HIM TO TALK TO US SOMEDAY INSTEAD OF HIDING BEHIND THAT OPTICON. OH! I'M SORRY. LINDSAY, IT'S OKAY. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME. WHY DON'T YOU GET SPILL PROOF GLASSES? BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO LEARN TO GET ALONG IN THE REAL WORLD. WE'RE COMING UP ON THE CORRAL... ...ASPEN TREES IN THE DISTANCE, AND THIS IS OUR STABLE MANAGER, RICK. RICK, THIS IS LINDSAY. HELLO, LINDSAY. IT SMELLS HERE. WHAT'S THE MATTER? YOU DON'T LIKE "ODE DE APPALOOSA?" COME ON. SEE YA. THESE ARE THE DIRECTIONS TO CAL MORRIS' RANCH. HE'S DONATING SOME TACK. WHEN YOU GET THERE, ASK FOR BUSTER. HE'S EXPECTING YOU. YOU CAN LOAD IT UP IN THE BACK. [ horse whinnies ] WHAT THE... HEY, THERE! YOU THE BOY FROM THE BLIND CAMP? YEAH, YOU THE OWNER? I'M THE CARETAKER. BUSTER HIGGINS. WHO DID THIS TO HIM? MRS. MORRIS WAS RIDING GHOST TOO HARD AND FELL. SHE WAS HURT PRETTY BAD. SO, MR. MORRIS STUCK HIM IN HERE TO STARVE HIM TO DEATH? IF HE WEREN'T SUCH A GENTLEMAN, HE WOULD HAVE KICKED HIS WAY OUT OF HIS STALL A LONG TIME AGO. WELL, BETTER LOAD UP THIS TACK. YOU GONNA HELP ME WITH THIS? OH, YEAH. I THINK YOU GOT EVERYTHING. OKAY, THANKS. YOU KNOW, MAYBE GHOST ISN'T AS MUCH OF A GENTLEMAN, AS YOU THINK. I GUESS IT'S POSSIBLE GHOST COULD ESCAPE. ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET YOU CLEANED UP. RICK? HE...,HE.... CAME WITH THE TACK. CAL IS GIVING US THIS HORSE? YEAH, YOU CAN SEE THE CONDITION HE'S IN. THE ONLY THING HE'S GOOD FOR IS RIDING KIDS IN THE CORRAL. CAN HE EVEN DO THAT? IN A COUPLE WEEKS, GHOST WILL BE AS GOOD AS NEW. GOOD WORK. HEY, YOU CAN'T SNEAK UP ON HORSES LIKE THAT. YOU'RE GONNA SPOOK 'EM. HEY, HEY, YOU DON'T HAVE TO LEAVE. YOU WANNA PET THE NEW HORSE? áá OKAY. COME OVER HERE. WALK SLOWLY. BE CAREFUL. STEP DOWN HERE. WALK UP TO HIM, SLOW. STICK YOUR HAND OUT AND TOUCH HIM. LET HIM KNOW YOU'RE THERE. ALL RIGHT. LET ME SEE YOUR HAND. STICK IT OUT. I'M GONNA LET YOU FEED HIM. THAT SPECIAL MIX IS PUTTING MEAT ON HIS BONES. WHAT'S WRONG? YOU DON'T LIKE BEING A COWBOY? HORSES ARE FUN TO RIDE. YOU USE YOUR HANDS AND KNEES AND LEGS TO TELL THEM WHERE TO GO. BILLY, YOU CAN'T LEAVE THE GROUP LIKE THAT. LISTEN, WE NEED 5 HORSES TACKED UP BY THIS AFTERNOON. DO YOU THINK YOU COULD HANDLE THAT? YEAH. MAYBE THE KIDS WOULD WANT TO LEARN TO TACK UP. I COULD TEACH THEM. I DON'T THINK THAT WOULD BE SUCH A GOOD IDEA, CONSIDERING... WHAT, I MIGHT RUB OFF ON THEM? TEN MINUTES WITH ME AND THEY'RE GONNA BE STEALING CARS, HUH? I DIDN'T KNOW THAT WAS YOUR SPECIALTY, GRAND THEFT. COME ON, BILLY. GRAB A HOLD. THAT A BOY. JUST HAVE THEM READY, OKAY? ALL RIGHT. HOP ON DOWN. ...A STEP HERE. [ Mimicking: ] JUST HAVE THEM READY, OKAY? ♪♪ [ Knocking ] YEAH. YEAH? HI! THAT'S FOR BLOWING ME AND JOEY OFF. HOW'D YOU GET IN HERE? I DROVE, HOW DO YOU THINK? IT'S NOT LIKE THERE ARE A LOT OF EYE WITNESSES AROUND HERE. LET'S SEE. OH, NASTY! SORRY, I HAD TO GET THAT OUT OF MY SYSTEM. I HOPE YOU FEEL BETTER. SO, HOW'S JOEY? OH, MAN. IS HE... THEY DIDN'T TELL YOU? WHAT? PSYCH... HE'S FINE. WHEN HE GETS BETTER- HE HAS TO GO TO JUVIE BUT I'M GOING TO SPRING HIM OUT. HOW YOU GONNA DO THAT? I GOT MY SOURCES. YEAH, YOU AND YOUR MANY FRIENDS. YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR PROBLEM IS? YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO PROPERLY MAINTAIN YOUR FRIENDSHIPS. LISTEN, I'M GOING TO BE 18 IN A COUPLE MONTHS. IF I DON'T WORK OUT HERE, THEY'RE GOING TO SEND ME TO THE BIG HOUSE. IT AIN'T GOING TO HAPPEN, MAN 'CUZ JOEY AND I ARE GONNA GET YOU OUTTA HERE. REALLY, MAN? DUDE... I OWE YOU ONE. YEAH, YOU DO. I'M TELLING YOU, HE'S CHANGED. HE'S A LITTLE CON MAN. LOOK AT THIS. THIS PLACE WAS A DISASTER BEFORE HE GOT HERE. COME ON. HEY, MACK! RICK. COULD YOU HAND ME THAT OTHER SNAP? THIS? YEAH, PUT IT ON HIS HALTER. COME ON, HE'S NOT GOING TO HURT YOU. HE'S GENTLE AS A LAMB. A BIG LAMB. YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THIS GUY A FEW WEEKS AGO. RICK'S NURSED HIM BACK TO HEALTH. YEAH? HE'S READY TO RIDE. HE'S REALLY GENTLE. HE'D BE PERFECT FOR THE MORE TIMID KIDS, LIKE BILLY. I THINK YOU'D MAKE A GOOD TEACHER. A TEACHER? WE NEED TO BREAK UP THE RIDING GROUPS. CLAY COULD TAKE OUT THE MORE ADVANCED KIDS AND YOU COULD WORK WITH THE LESS CONFIDENT ONES. I'VE NEVER REALLY TAUGHT BEFORE. ANNIE, COULD I SPEAK TO YOU A MINUTE, PLEASE. RICK IS NOT LIKE YOUR KIDS. OH, REALLY? HE'S ALIENATED, HE HAS NO SELF ESTEEM, HE MISSED THE ADVANTAGES THAT NORMAL KIDS HAD. HE CAN'T HANDLE THAT KIND OF RESPONSIBILITY. THAT'S FUNNY. PEOPLE SAY THAT SAME THING ABOUT THE BLIND. ALL RIGHT BILLY, THIS IS THE LAST STEP. PUT YOUR LEFT FOOT THROUGH THE STIRRUP. THERE YOU GO-- JUST LIKE THAT! SWING YOUR RIGHT ONE OVER. ALL RIGHT COWBOY, GET YOU RIDIN'. STAY HERE AND PET GHOST LIKE I SHOWED YOU. I'LL GO DOWN AND PUT LINDSAY ON HER HORSE. WOW LINDSAY, YOU LOOK LIKE A RIDER. WEAR BOOTS NEXT TIME. I'M NOT RIDING. I ONLY CAME BECAUSE ANNIE MADE ME. RIDE WITH US, LINDSAY, IT'S EASY. BILLY DID IT, HE'S NOT SCARED. I'M NOT SCARED. I'M JUST A LITTLE OLD FOR YOUR PONY RIDES. AT LEAST TALK TO YOUR HORSE. WILL YOU GIVE IT UP! WOULD YOU GET IN THE SADDLE? DON'T PUSH ME! FINE. DO WHAT YOU WANT. I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR SPOILED BRATS. ALL RIGHT GUYS, COME ON. WE'RE GOING DOWN BY THE CREEK. BRING IT FORWARD. ALL RIGHT. LOOKING AWFUL SERIOUS, COWBOY. YOU DOING OKAY? GOOD, WE'RE HERE TO HAVE SOME FUN. SIT UP STRAIGHT IN YOUR SADDLE. HOLD YOUR PALOMINO'S HEAD UP. OKAY. OH, WHOA, HOLD UP EVERYBODY. YES, TIM? WHAT COLOR IS MY HORSE? WELL, HE'S A BUCKSKIN. SO HE'S BROWN WITH A BLACK MANE AND TAIL. WHAT'S BROWN LIKE? BROWN? UH,.. BROWN IS... AHHH... GOOD RIDIN', BILLY. COOL OFF, BOY. WHAT'S GOTTEN INTO HIM? THIS HORSE IS GOING CRAZY. WOW, HE'S ON HIS HIND LEGS. BEAUTIFUL! WHOA, GHOST JUST CLEARED FIVE FEET EASY! BILLY, WE'VE GOT OURSELVES A JUMPER. HEY, STABLE BOY! ANNIE WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU IN HER OFFICE. PRONTO! [ Knocking ] COME IN. HI. HI. I GOT A PHONE CALL FROM LINDSAY'S FATHER. HE SAID YOU CALLED HER A SPOILED BRAT AND TRIED TO FORCE HER TO RIDE. [ Sigh ] YOU WANT TO TELL ME YOUR SIDE OF THE STORY? SHE WAS THROWING A TANTRUM. SHE WOULDN'T GET IN THE SADDLE. SHE IS A SPOILED BRAT! SIT DOWN. I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING. [ Announcer: ] We're in the final rotation. This is Lindsay Kurtz. THAT'S LINDSAY! ...here at the national qualifying meet. This is an excellent event for Lindsay. [ Annie: ] SHE WAS RANKED NUMBER ONE GOING INTO THE REGIONALS. THIS VIDEO WAS SHOT DURING THE PRE-OLYMPIC TRIALS. She's upgraded the level of difficulty... Here's her most difficult pass...beautifully done. NOT BAD. All she needs to do is stick the dismount and she can qualify for the national championship. This is a new dismount for her. Very difficult. A round-off double twist. OH, MY. Oh...she was way off from the end of the beam. Oh, that's a terrible fall. We can only hope she's okay. Look how far she is off the end of the beam and yet she hit... THAT'S HOW SHE BECAME BLIND? FLASH PHOTOS AREN'T ALLOWED AT GYMNASTIC EVENTS. BUT, SOMETIMES PEOPLE DON'T FOLLOW THE RULES. SHE GOT DISTRACTED AND SHE FELL. I JUST FIGURED SHE HAD BEEN BLIND HER WHOLE LIFE. ONLY A FEW MONTHS. THE OTHER KIDS HAVE HAD YEARS TO WORK THROUGH THEIR ANGER AND ADJUST. LOOK, I KNOW THAT WORKING WITH LINDSAY REQUIRES A LOT OF PATIENCE. MAYBE YOU'LL DECIDE SHE'S WORTH IT. [ clapping ] WHO'S THERE? RICK. HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN WATCHING? LONG ENOUGH TO SEE THAT WHIRLY-JUMP-THING. FULL TWISTING BACK LAYOUT. EXACTLY! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BACKING AWAY FROM PEOPLE? I DON'T. YOU WERE CROWDING MY SPACE. THEN I WON'T COME ANY CLOSER. GOOD. I'M GOING TO BE HONEST. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO ACT AROUND GIRLS LIKE YOU ....BEAUTIFUL, CLASSY. I'M SORRY WE GOT STARTED OFF ON THE WRONG FOOT. SOMETIMES I CAN BE A LITTLE HOT HEADED. I REALLY WANT TO TEACH YOU TO RIDE. I KNOW ABOUT YOUR ACCIDENT. I JUST WANT TO HELP. YOU WANT TO HELP? YEAH. HELP SOMEONE ELSE. I WOULDN'T GO RIDING WITH YOU IF YOU PAID ME. ON YOUR MARKS... GET SET...GO! GO BILLY! WE'RE GONNA WIN! YEAH! [ Bell rings ] RICK HAS REALLY GOTTEN TO BILLY. IT MUST BE ALL THAT RIDING THEY'VE BEEN DOING. YEAH, HE'S QUITE SOME ROLE MODEL. CLAY, WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM WITH HIM, ANYWAY? HE'S A CRIMINAL! HE'S JUST WALTZES IN HERE AND ACTS LIKE HE OWNS THE PLACE. OH, HE GUESS HE FORGOT THAT WAS YOUR JOB. I TOLD YA YOU COULD BE A COWBOY. YOU READY TO CANTER? KICK HIM FORWARD WITH YOUR HEELS. LOOKING GOOD. HANDS HIGHER. PARTNER, I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING, MAN TO MAN. GOOD. SEE, I THINK LINDSAY'S PRETTY NEAT. I WANT TO TAKE HER RIDING BUT SHE'S AFRAID OF THESE HORSES. I'LL NEVER GET HER OUT TO THE CORRAL BY MYSELF. SHE MIGHT COME IF YOU TAKE HER. MAYBE BETWEEN THE TWO OF US WE CAN CONVINCE HER TO RIDE. TAKE YOU ON YOUR OWN PERSONAL TRAIL RIDE. I PROMISE. ALL RIGHT, THAT'S MY MAN. HORSES? BILLY..., I TOLD YOU, I DON'T WANT TO RIDE. WHY CAN'T ANYBODY GET THAT. COME ON, WHERE'S YOUR SENSE OF ADVENTURE? IT'S OKAY. SHE'S JUST PLAYING HARD TO GET. LINDSAY, IT'S BROOK. I SUPPOSE YOU WANT ME TO JOIN IN SOMETHING, TOO. DON'T WORRY, NOT THE DREADED GROUP ACTIVITY. I JUST WISH PEOPLE WOULDN'T PUSH ME SO MUCH. I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU MEAN. AT SCHOOL, I USED TO GET REALLY NERVOUS TAKING EXAMS. I WAS IN A PACKED LECTURE HALL WITH THE TEACHER STARING RIGHT AT ME. MY DAD SAID TO PRETEND I WAS THE ONLY PERSON TAKING THE TEST. THAT NO ONE ELSE WAS AROUND. THAT WORKED? IT SOUNDS STUPID, BUT YEAH, ACTUALLY IT DID. IT TOOK THE PRESSURE OFF. LISTEN LINDSAY, WE ALL COPE WITH THINGS DIFFERENTLY. I'LL FOLLOW MY DAD'S ADVICE AND LEAVE YOU ALONE. THANKS. HELLO? [ Wings beating ] I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T LIKE MY STUPID HORSE? I JUST DON'T LIKE TO BE FORCED TO DO SOMETHING. OBVIOUSLY. LISTEN, IF YOU WANT TO RIDE, NEXT TIME, TELL ME, ALTHOUGH YOU MIGHT BE A LITTLE ADVANCED FOR ME. I STILL HAVE TO USE SADDLE AND STIRRUPS. HEY, WAIT! AREN'T YOU GOING TO HELP ME DOWN? YOU DIDN'T NEED ANY HELP GETTING UP. [ Horse whinnies ] WE'RE JUST GOING ON A TRAIL RIDE, IT'S NOT SWAN LAKE. [ Rick: ] WHY'D YOU ACT LIKE YOU'VE NEVER RIDDEN? [ Lindsay: ] BECAUSE THINGS THAT USED TO BE FAMILIAR, JUST AREN'T ANYMORE. I FELT THE SAME WAY WHEN MY DAD DIED. I REMEMBER RIDING MY BIKE INTO TOWN AND NOT HAVING A CLUE HOW TO GET BACK. I'VE NEVER UNDERSTOOD THAT. EVERYTHING HAD CHANGED. YOU STILL KNEW HOW TO GET TO YOUR HOUSE. YOU JUST DIDN'T HAVE A "HOME" ANYMORE. YEAH. HI, LINDSAY. HI, BROOK. COME ON, GUYS. HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT HERE? YOU WANT TO RIDE? I WANT YOU TO TEACH ME TO JUMP. JUMP? YOU MEAN LIKE WITH HORSES? YES! WHAT? STADIUM JUMPING? LINDSAY, COME ON, THOSE RIDERS HAVE HAD YEARS OF EXPERIENCE. SO HAVE I, IN GYMNASTICS. IT'S NOT THE SAME. THE SKILLS ARE THE SAME. YOU NEED BALANCE, COORDINATION, AGILITY... AND SIGHT. LINDSAY, I NEVER EVEN HEARD OF A BLIND RIDER COMPETING. BESIDES, YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE A JUMPER. GHOST IS A JUMPER. I HEARD YOU SAY HE CLEARED 5 FEET, EASY. YOU KNOW HOW HIGH 5 FEET IS? LINDSAY..., YOU COULD REALLY GET HURT. I'VE ALREADY BEEN HURT. LOOK..., I KNOW THAT I'LL NEVER HAVE MY OLD LIFE BACK BUT I WANT SOMETHING BETTER THAN THIS. I JUST WANT YOU TO GET THE FEEL OF THE MOVEMENT. [ Laughing ] THIS IS EASY. DON'T WORRY IT GETS HARDER. LOOKIN' GOOD! LEAN IN, HUG WITH YOUR KNEES. GOOD, NICE! HUG WITH YOUR KNEES. LINDSAY, LOOKING GOOD! HEELS DOWN, LEAN FORWARD. AHHH... NOT THAT FAR FORWARD. AHH... IT'S TOO MUDDY. GHOST SLIPPED! YOU LEANED TOO FAR FORWARD. YOU THREW HIM OFF BALANCE. GIVE ME YOUR HAND. AHHHH. [ Laughing] STAY IN YOUR CIRCLE. COUNT YOUR STRIDES. THREE-TWO-ONE, SQUEEZE AND JUMP. I GUESS HE DIDN'T WANT TO JUMP. NO KIDDING! LINDSAY, WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME RIDING WITH US? MAYBE LATER. OKAY. [ Whistle blows ] COME ON BILLY, FASTER, FASTER! WAY TO GO, IT'S A REALLY CLOSE RACE! WE'RE ALMOST THERE! COME ON BILLY! THAT'S THE WAY TO PADDLE! WE'RE ALMOST THERE! GOOD JOB, BILLY! HEY, YOU TRYING TO GET ME BUSTED? RIGHT, LIKE, WHO'S GONNA SEE? [ Bell rings ] WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? GOOD QUESTION, NEVER MIND! HEY, LOOK. C'MON BLITZ, YOU KNOW I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU. GOOD. COME PARTY WITH US, TONIGHT. I CAN'T. MAN, WHAT IS IT WITH YOU? YOU LIKE HANGING OUT WITH THE BLIND? OH, EXCUSE ME, "THE VISUALLY IMPAIRED." GIVE IT A REST, WILL YOU? YOU KNOW I'VE GOTTA LAY LOW FOR A WHILE. BESIDES, DO YOU EVEN HAVE US A PLACE TO STAY YET... SOME JOBS MAYBE? GOT A PROSPECT ON THE EAST COAST. I'M WORKING ON IT. DON'T SCREW THIS UP. [ Clay: ] THE WINNER? BILLY! [ Applause ] WAY TO GO, BILLY! WAY TO GO! THAT LAST JUMP FELT SO GREAT. REALLY SMOOTH. I THINK GHOST AND I HAVE GOOD CHEMISTRY. ARE YOU LOOKING AT ME? HOW CAN YOU TELL? I CAN FEEL YOUR EYES ON ME. THEY WERE. WHAT WERE YOU THINKING? I WAS THINKING ABOUT HOW MUCH YOUR JUMPING HAS IMPROVED AND THAT WE SHOULD CELEBRATE. A CLASSY GIRL LIKE ME OUT WITH A NEANDERTHAL LIKE YOU? WHAT DID YOU HAVE IN MIND? [ Knocking ] YEAH! WAS OUR TRAIL RIDE TONIGHT? CAN YOU KEEP A BIG SECRET? I'VE GOT A DATE TONIGHT, WITH LINDSAY. OH, COME ON. YOU KNOW HOW HARD I'VE WORKED TO WIN HER OVER. YOU AND ME CAN GO RIDING ANYTIME, OKAY? PARTNER? HEY, HOP IN. RIGHT ON TIME. WHAT DID YOU SAY HER NAME WAS AGAIN? LOU-LOU? LOU-LOU? NO, IT'S LINDSAY. OH, RIGHT. SORRY. GET OUTTA HERE. [ Music from inside ] HEY, GUYS! WHAT'S UP? WHAT'S GOIN' ON? [ Loud music playing ] IT SOUNDS REALLY CROWDED IN HERE. THAT'S BECAUSE IT IS. WE'LL GET YOU OUT ON THIS DANCE FLOOR. I DON'T THINK SO. HEY, DESPERADO, WELCOME TO THE PARTY. RICK, TOM HALLS. HI. WANT A DRINK? NO, THANKS. YOU SURE KNOW HOW TO PICK 'EM. SEE YOU LATER. IS SHE BLIND? YEAH...BE COOL. YOU KNOW, I'M A REALLY BIG FAN OF STEVIE WONDER. WHAT? OUCH, WATCH IT! I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY. LINDSAY. LINDSAY! I'M SO SORRY. YOUR FRIEND IS... SUCH A DIPLOMAT. SCHAEF'S ALL RIGHT. HE JUST DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO ACT AROUND GIRLS LIKE YOU. YOU MEAN A BLIND GIRL? NO, I MEAN A COOL GIRL. HUMMM?...COME ON.

LOOK UP IN THE SKY. OKAY? ALL RIGHT, I'M LOOKING. ORION IS SHAPED LIKE A WARRIOR. THERE ARE TWO STARS STRAIGHT ACROSS FOR HIS SHOULDERS, AND THREE AT AN ANGLE FOR HIS BELT, AND TWO HANGING FROM HIS BELT FOR THE SWORD, AND THEN TWO MORE AT THE BOTTOM FOR HIS FEET. DO YOU SEEM THEM? YEAH. JUST LIKE YOU DESCRIBED IT. [ Horse whinnies ] [ Owl hoots ] YOU KNOW, I'VE ONLY BEEN BLIND 3 MONTHS BUT I'VE ALREADY STARTED TO FORGET WHAT SOME THINGS LOOK LIKE. YOU REMEMBERED ORION PRETTY GOOD. YEAH, BUT WHEN I WAS ON THE PHONE WITH MY DAD, I TRIED TO SEE HIM IN MY MIND, IT... IT WAS LIKE LOOKING AT A BLURRED PICTURE. I TRIED TO MAKE OUT HIS JAW LINE AND HIS EYES, BUT I COULDN'T. MY OLD MAN WAS REALLY STRICT. MOST WEEKENDS HE MADE ME MUCK OUT STABLES. EXCEPT FOR THIS ONE SUNDAY. I MUST HAVE BEEN BILLY'S AGE. HE TOOK ME TO THE TRACK. WE SAT IN THE STANDS AND ATE HOTDOGS. MY DAD LOST MONEY, BUT I WON. I BET ON "YOUNG AND RESTLESS." A 10:1 SHOT. HE PUT ME ON HIS SHOULDERS AND STARTED YELLING TO EVERYONE, "MY BOY'S A WINNER," "MY BOY'S A WINNER!" IT'S THE ONLY TIME I REMEMBER HIM BEING PROUD OF ME. I THINK IF YOUR DAD COULD SEE YOU NOW, HE'D BE PROUD OF YOU. AFTER A GIRL SAYS SOMETHING LIKE THAT, HE SHOULD PROBABLY KISS HER. [ Horse whinnies ] [ Wolf growls ] [ Growling ] [ Crying ] I WILL DEAL WITH YOU LATER. RIGHT NOW WE NEED YOUR HELP. BILLY AND GHOST ARE MISSING. YEAH, OKAY, ALL RIGHT, THANKS FOR THE HELP. I'LL LET THEM KNOW. THE SHERIFF'S ROUNDED UP SOME RANCHERS. THEY'RE SEARCHING THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN. WE'LL FOLLOW THE RIVER TO RED ROCK TRAIL. I HAVE A HUNCH THAT'S WHERE HE WENT.

[ Clay: ] COME ON, BROOK, LET'S TAKE BILLY BACK. COME ON. OKAY. MY HORSE WILL FOLLOW YOU. GHOST IS TOO TIRED. WE'LL HAVE TO WALK HIM BACK TO THE CAMP. DON'T TAKE TOO LONG. ANNIE'S DYING TO TALK TO YOU. [ Rick: ] SORRY ABOUT THIS. WATCH YOUR STEP. I'M GOING TO SET YOU DOWN. IS IT BEHIND ME? YEAH, THERE YOU GO. THANKS. YOU KNOW, IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY. THAT'S A STUPID THING TO SAY. WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY? HOW ABOUT, "RICK, YOU'RE A LOSER," OR "RICK YOU'RE A.." IT WASN'T YOUR FAULT. BILLY DECIDED TO GO RIDING ALL BY HIMSELF. BECAUSE I DITCHED HIM FOR YOU. I WAS SUPPOSED TO TAKE HIM RIDING, LAST NIGHT. THE DAY MY DAD HAD A HEART ATTACK I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE CLEANING THE BARN. TYPICAL RICK, WENT AND PLAYED BALL. FOUND HIM IN THE STABLES WITH HIS FACE DOWN AND ARMS STRETCHED OUT LIKE HE WAS GOING FOR HELP. HE ALWAYS SAID I COULDN'T BE RELIED ON. EVEN IF YOU'D BEEN THERE, WHO KNOWS IF YOU COULD HAVE DONE ANYTHING. THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT. I DON'T KNOW AND I NEVER WILL BECAUSE I WASN'T THERE. I DID THE SAME THING WITH BILLY. IF I WOULD HAVE JUST TAKEN HIM RIDING LAST NIGHT NONE OF THIS WOULD EVER HAPPENED. IT'S DIFFERENT THIS TIME. BILLY'S OKAY BECAUSE OF YOU. I WISH ANNIE BELIEVED THAT. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE MOST OBEDIENT, DOCILE LITTLE BOY TAKING OUT A HORSE ALONE AT NIGHT. IT'S JUST NOT LIKE HIM. I KNOW WHO IT'S LIKE. HAVE YOU CALLED LINDSAY'S PARENTS? HOW DO I EXPLAIN THAT THE NICE CRIMINAL I HIRED SNUCK THEIR DAUGHTER OUT FOR A MIDNIGHT TRYST? DON'T SAY IT. WHAT, DON'T SAY, "I TOLD YOU SO?" RIGHT! [ Knocking ] COME IN. HEY, CAL. EXCUSE ME. I HEARD THE BOY'S DOING OKAY. YEAH, AND SO IS GHOST... THE HORSE YOU DONATED. ANNIE, I NEVER DONATED ANY HORSE. OH, GREAT. MR. MORRIS WOULD LIKE HIS HORSE BACK. BUT GHOST BELONGS TO THE CAMP. NO, HE DOESN'T. MAYBE YOU COULD EXPLAIN HOW GHOST GOT HERE, RICK. WHAT ARE THEY TALKING ABOUT? WELL, I TOOK HIM. AND MADE IT LOOK LIKE HE ESCAPED. I HAD TO. [ Clay: ] THAT'S A GOOD ONE. GOSH JUDGE, JUST SAW THAT CHAMPIONSHIP HORSE AND JUST HAD TO HAVE HIM. COME ON, YOU ALL SAW WHAT HE LOOKED LIKE WHEN I BROUGHT HIM HERE. MY WIFE PRACTICALLY BROKE HER NECK BECAUSE OF THAT HORSE. YOU GOT A BUNCH OF BLIND KIDS RIDING ON HIM. I'M ONE OF THEM AND I CAN TELL YOU GHOST WOULD NEVER HURT ANYONE. HE'S REALLY GREAT WITH THE KIDS. WELL, HE'S NOT THEIR HORSE. COME ON. WHERE ARE YOU TAKING HIM? RICK? RICK'S GOTTA GO BACK TO JUVENILE HALL. NO! LINDSAY, I'M SORRY. ANNIE, LOOK. OH, MY GOSH! MACK. MACK! STOP! COME BACK! WAIT! YAAA! YAAA! [ Gunshot ] MACK, HOLD ON! I'M TURNING YOU IN! FOR WHAT, TRYING TO GET BACK MY OWN HORSE? HOW ABOUT ASSAULT WITH A DEADLY WEAPON ON A MINOR, NO LESS? CAL, I'M SURE MACK WOULD DROP THE CHARGES... WHAT? IF, YOU DONATE GHOST TO THE CAMP. RIGHT, MACK? WHAT DO YOU SAY, CAL? IS IT A DEAL? [ Laughs ] COME ON, I'LL MAKE YOU SOME OF MY FAMOUS BANANA PANCAKES. I'LL SETTLE FOR A BUCKET OF ICE. ANNIE, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY. AT LEAST YOU SAVED GHOST. PUT YOUR STUFF IN THE BACK, RICK. BILLY? WHAT IS IT, SON? HONEY, WHAT'S GOING ON? I GOTTA GO. MACK, MAYBE WE SHOULD CHECK IT OUT. ALL RIGHT. YOU WANT ME TO JUST WAIT HERE? OH, YEAH, WHY DON'T I JUST LEAVE YOU MY KEYS. COME ON! BILLY, I HOPE YOU'RE NOT WASTING MACK'S TIME. WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT? MACK, ARE YOU HERE? YEAH, ANNIE TOO. OH, GOOD. I WANTED TO GIVE YOU BOTH A PREVIEW. THANKS TO RICK'S COACHING, I'M READY TO COMPETE IN THE STADIUM JUMPING COMPETITION NEXT WEEK. LINDSAY, WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT THIS. ACTUALLY, I'D PREFER TO SHOW YOU. WAIT A MINUTE, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO LET HER DO THIS. SHE CAN DO IT! ANNIE! MACK, LET'S JUST...WATCH. RICK TAUGHT ME HOW TO PACE OFF THE AREA BETWEEN JUMPS. WHEN I HEAR THESE LEAVES RUSTLING, I KNOW I HAVE 8 PACES FROM THE FIRST TURN. 3, 2, 1... SQUEEZE AND... JUMP! YEAH, BEAUTIFUL, LINDSAY, BEAUTIFUL! AGAIN! 3-2-1... SQUEEZE...JUMP! WHOA! BEAUTIFUL, LINDSAY! WHOA! YOU TAUGHT HER TO DO THAT? YEAH, BUT SHE'S A NATURAL ATHLETE. DON'T SELL YOURSELF SHORT. LINDSAY WAS CATATONIC WHEN SHE ARRIVED. RICK WAS THE ONLY ONE THAT GOT THROUGH TO HER. I NEED MY COACH FOR THE COMPETITION, MACK. CAN'T YOU LET HIM STAY ON UNTIL THEN? RICK KNEW THE RULES. HE BROKE THEM. HE'S NOT A GOOD INFLUENCE. SHE COULD NEVER HAVE DONE THIS WITHOUT HIM. SURE SHE COULD. YOU HEARD HIM, HE SAID SHE'S A NATURAL ATHLETE. COME ON. YOU CAN DO IT WITHOUT ME. YOU'LL BE GREAT, LINDSAY. DON'T GO! PLEASE, MACK, HE'S MY BEST FRIEND. IF THAT'S NOT A GOOD INFLUENCE, I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS. WHAT IF HE COMES HERE DURING THE DAY JUST TO TRAIN LINDSAY AND NOTHING ELSE? ALL RIGHT. BUT AS SOON AS THE COMPETITION IS OVER YOU GO BACK TO JUVIE FULL TIME, YOU GOT IT? I GOT IT... [ Rick: ] THANKS MACK. OH, MACK. AND DON'T, "OH, MACK!" PLEASE, ANNIE. THANKS, PARTNER. YOU'RE WELCOME..., PARTNER. LET'S GET LINDSAY. COME ON, GIRL. OKAY, THIS IS WHERE YOU ENTER. THE FENCES ARE SET UP JUST LIKE THE CAMP. COME ON, BILLY. I'M GOING TO PUT YOU UP HERE ON THIS FENCE.

PUT HIM INTO A CANTER. GOOD. FOUR PACES LATER YOU'RE INTO YOUR FIRST TURN. OKAY. NOW YOU'VE CIRCLED AROUND. 1-2-3-4 STOP. 4 STRIDES AND YOU'RE AT THE FIRST JUMP.

IT'S A BRICK WALL BUT DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. IT'S FOR THE MEDAL CLASS. OH, BILLY! [ Announcer: ] Welcome folks, to the annual All English Rocky Mountain horse fair. The competitors are ready and waiting at the entry gates so let's get started. Rider number 14, now approaching jump number 3. There will be a warning call for competitors in the class to gather at the entry prior to the competition. THANK YOU. SEE YOU IN A LITTLE BIT. The first class will be regular warm up hunters with fences set at two and a half feet. Riders, prepare to enter the ring. In accordance with standard jumping guidelines, all rules will be in effect. BRUSH HIS MANE REALLY GOOD, OKAY? I'M BRUSHIN', I'M BRUSHIN'. [ horse whinnies ] HOW DO I LOOK? LIKE A RIDER. RICK, YOU ARE SUCH A POET. YOU LOOK ABSOLUTELY STUNNING, LINDSAY! THANK YOU.

It's okay, folks, she's on her feet. YEAH. BUT YOU WON'T. The last rider... number 28. please enter the ring. WHY ARE THEY CALLING YOUR NUMBER? YOU'RE NOT IN THE MEDAL CLASS. YES, I AM. LINDSAY, YOU DIDN'T? THE COURSE IS THE SAME. THE MEDAL CLASS IS FOR EXPERIENCED RIDERS. THE JUMPS ARE HIGHER AND THERE'S THE BRICK WALL. YOU HEARD THE LAST RIDER KISS THE DIRT. RICK, I MISS COMPETING. I MISS THE SPOTLIGHT. THE ENERGY FROM THE CROWD. THE SICK FEELING I GET IN MY STOMACH. WHY DOES IT HAVE TO BE THIS CLASS? BECAUSE IT'S THE TOUGHEST. I NEED TO KNOW IF CAN DO IT AND KNOW YOU'RE WITH ME. Second call for number 28, please enter the ring. THEN, I'M WITH YOU. ALL THE WAY. COME ON BUDDY. On course is number 28, Lindsay Kurtz, riding Ghost. LINDSAY'S JUMPING OVER THAT? SHE'LL BE FINE, GEORGE. [ Crowd: ] OH... BEAUTIFUL! BEAUTIFUL! [ Whistle ] HEY, WHO'S YOUR FRIEND? YOU'RE LOOKING GOOD, JOEY. OH, MAN, THAT'S HUGE. YEAH. LET'S BAIL. WE GOT US AN APARTMENT... IN NEW YORK CITY. REALLY? NO MORE JUVIE. NO MORE PROBATION OFFICERS. JUST THE THREE OF US IN MANHATTAN. COME ON, MAN, WE'RE OUTTA HERE. 3... 2... 1... [ Crowd: ] OHHHH. GHOST. GHOST? GHOST! WHAT HAPPENED? LINDSAY FELL. LINDSAY, ARE YOU OKAY? YEAH, HOW'S GHOST? HE LOOKS FINE. I SCREWED UP. IT'S OKAY. NO, IT'S NOT. I DID THE SAME THING ON THE BEAM. THAT WASN'T YOUR FAULT. I SAW THE TAPE. IT WAS THE CAMERA FLASHES. NO, IT WASN'T. I JUST LET PEOPLE THINK THAT. I TOOK MY EYE OFF THE BEAM. I LOST MY CONCENTRATION. JUST LIKE I LET MY FOOT SLIP FROM THE STIRRUP. The judge is entering the ring. We'll wait for an official ruling. I WANTED TO KNOW IF I COULD DO IT. I GUESS, NOW, I KNOW. NO, YOU DON'T KNOW. YOU HAVEN'T FINISHED. MISS KURTZ, DO YOU NEED ANY ASSISTANCE LEAVING THE ARENA? SHE WANTS TO DO THE JUMP AGAIN. BUT SHE'S... BLIND? SHE SORTA KNOWS THAT. IS THERE A LAW AGAINST BLIND RIDERS COMPETING? TECHNICALLY, NO. BUT SHE'S ALREADY BEEN DISQUALIFIED FOR MISSING THE JUMP. THAT'S OKAY. SHE JUST WANTS TO FINISH. THIS IS HIGHLY UNUSUAL. THAT'S OKAY. SO AM I. OKAY. LOOKS LIKE SHE'S GONNA GET BACK ON GHOST. ALL RIGHT! ARE YOU STILL WITH ME? YEAH. [ Applause and cheering ] YOU CAN DO IT! Number 28 is disqualified, however, the judge will allow her to complete the jump. C'MON, MAN, LET'S NOT STICK AROUND. WHAT'S TO THINK ABOUT? YOU KNOW MACK'S GOING TO TAKE YOU BACK TO JUVIE AFTER THE SHOW. YEAH, I KNOW. I'M NOT GOING. WHAT? YOU'RE GONNA THROW AWAY OUR PLANS, THROW AWAY YOUR FREEDOM, TO WATCH SOME BLIND GIRL RIDE A PONY? IF THAT'S THE WAY YOU WANT TO PUT IT, YEAH. YOUR PRIORITIES ARE WAY SCREWED UP, MAN. COME ON, BLITZ, FORGET ABOUT HIM. I DON'T KNOW YOU, MAN. ALL RIGHT COWBOY, HERE SHE GOES. CROSS YOUR FINGERS. [ Crowd cheers ] ALL RIGHT, LINDSAY! YEE HAW! Number 28 has cleared the jump. How about a hand for Lindsay Kurtz on Ghost. HEY, WE DIDN'T DO NOTHING, MAN. YOU GUYS UNDERESTIMATE YOURSELVES. YOUR ESCAPE WAS DEFINITELY SOMETHING. COME ON. THERE YOU GO. YOU FINISHED. NEXT YEAR, I'LL PLACE FIRST. YOU JUST MIGHT, TOO. We'd like to thanks our sponsors for their generosity in the individual prizes awarded today. I HEARD YOU WERE PLANNING A TRIP TO NEW YORK. GOOD THING YOU DECIDED NOT TO GO. YOUR PALS ARE TAKING A LITTLE DETOUR. [ Annie: ] I JUST TALKED TO BUSTER. HE SAID HE COULDN'T STAND TO LET CAL TORTURE GHOST SO HE LET RICK HAVE THE HORSE. HE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING BEFORE BECAUSE HE THOUGHT HE'D LOSE HIS JOB. GO ON, TAKE YOUR LAP, COACH. THANK YOU, MACK. YOU KNOW, I COULD USE A PERMANENT STABLE BOY. MAYBE WE COULD DISCUSS THIS OVER DINNER. MAYBE. DO YOU COOK ANYTHING OTHER THAN BANANA PANCAKES? NO. BUT I DO A MEAN TAKE OUT. [ Applause ] Captions by CaptionHouse
