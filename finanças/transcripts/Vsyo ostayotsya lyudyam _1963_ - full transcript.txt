You're such a big boy but you're still playing hopscotch! Injections all night, and now again. He's still joking. What a man! He lives only because he wants to. Well, Natalia Dmitrievna? - Did you call Serafim Nikolayevich? - I did. He'll come soon. He's got Mass right now, - he will come when it's over. - Good. - She's deaf, but still understands. - She lipreads. Got into a bombing during the war. Is he a believer then? To say that... A religious academic! Why does he need a pope then? That's a relative of Natalia Dmitrievna. They like to talk when he comes from Moscow. - Hello, Zina. - Hello. - How's things? - How's health? - Oh, health... - Was there a consilium? - It ended an hour ago. Come in, please. Good day. - Can I come to him? - He's waiting. - Is there anyone with Fyodor Alexeyevich? - A lot. - He's better, then? - I'm not a doctor. Can you call for Natalia Dmitrievna please. How many times do we have to? I plead you. I beg. He said he doesn't want to see you anymore. JANUARY All Remains To People Write down. "Dear First Regional Committee Secretary, This prolonged carry-on with electricity in Marfino village is outrageous. That is", colon. - Did you put the colon? - Long ago. So, summarise the story and say that three Marfino letters to their local office were ignored. End like this: "Considering the above, I reach out to you while, so to say, jumping over them. Jumping over them. "While, SO TO SAY, jumping over them". - "While, SO TO SAY, jump over them". - And the signature. High Council deputy, professor Dronov. An invitation from England. They're having a physics congress in two months. Dear professor Dronov... I cannot. Thank them and politely decline. Hey! Stop-stop! What did they say in Moscow? - What do you mean? - The doctors. The usual medical things: breathe, don't breathe. Show your tongue, that's it. - He's in. - Thank you. Doctor, doctor, where've you been? By the river drinking gin. Maybe there was a mistake made in the calculations - and since I am responsible for this... - No, everything is fine there. The materials just can't bear the high temperature. Are you sure there are no other reasons for an accident? - I don't see them. - You don't, but Fyodor Alexeyevich will. Perhaps. My eyesight is bad anyway. I almost got run over by a bus once when I wasn't wearing glasses. My god, with our traffic! What would you do in Moscow without glasses? Without glasses, I wouldn't be doing anything in Moscow already. - Ksenia Petrovna... - Don't. Dear Alexey Nikolayevich, let's not talk about that. Not yet. Oh well. A man keeps hoping as long as he's alive. And he's alive while there's hope. Is Viktor Andreyevich here? Yes, please. What happened, Asya? I called Moscow. - I talked with professor Snitko. - Right. I know now why Fyodor Alekseyevich avoids me. Why exactly? Dronov must stop working immediately. Otherwise it will end very badly. And soon. You mean... All of you must pick his workload up. He must rest. You see, Asya, it's not very nice in my situation. It means I've appointed my own self... Lights on. The annihilation proposition can give an explanation to almost all cases of elementary particle interactions. In some cases particles and antiparticles could be synonymous. - Or match perfectly. - Go on. As it happened in the case of Patton. Good day, Asya Davydovna. How is your health? Here's what, Fyodor Alekseyevich, if you don't respect me as a person.. Not at all! At least respect me as your doctor. - What did the doctors say? - Nothing. - Really nothing? - You came, they stood quietly, you left? - Not really. I called Moscow and talked to professor Snitko. I know everything. That's a different matter, then. I'm listening. - I forbid you from working. - Won't happen. - I will complain! - Oh! To whom? Full rest. For a year at least. Then you can work. - The opposite will happen. - Please understand, this is suicide! You don't understand suicide right. Suicide is an escape from life. But I don't want to stop living even for a minute. Please understand, I don't want it any other way. Right now, if you want to know, a matter of my lifetime is being decided. In short, if you want to go to Mars, I'll put you there by acquaintance. - Still joking. - How to say! The thing is, plasma, as the basis of energetics of the future... But if I talk about the technicalities, you won't understand anyway. I have to be here to lead this project. Vyazmin's got brains, but my authority is needed for the factory to believe. Everybody is afraid of the new. It initially brings only trouble. But this work is my body, my brain, my breath, and myself. And you want me to drop it all. And why? To rest? For what? To live for a year, two longer? Doing nothing? Excuse me, could this be called living? Why do I need such a life? Just to exist? But... Wait, wait. Settle on one thing. Either talk or cry. I understand very well what hides in your "but". Treat me. Stuff me with pills, cut me, I agree to everything. I'll bear it all. Everything bodily is yours, except this. But Snitko only gave you a year... He gave it, I took it, we're square, full stop. We'll have a falling out with you. My dear, dearest doctor, you and I will never fall out! But I will set up a regime. You will drop everything else. - If you won't follow it... - I swear, I will. Friends! You are my closest assistants. - Students! - Alright, fine. That's why I decided to share this with you first. Certain matters force me to shorten the time of working on the engine, more precisely: To submit it within a year at most. - That's impossible! - I have thought and evaluated it all out. In order to fully focus on the project I hand over my leadership, temporarily, to our respected Viktor Andreyevich. How can I, Fyodor Aleskeyevich? Accept my congratulations. Are you sure there won't be an incident this time? - The institute has done everything it could. - If something happens again, we'll return it back. - Group one. - Ready. - Group two. - Ready. - Group three. - Ready. Ready in 15 seconds. Attention. Start. - Drop the pressure. - Slowly. - What? Explosion again? - Yes, the shards have damaged the armor. - But happily- - Go to hell with your happiness! I'm afraid you're not entirely objective, comrades. Dronov's work is of massive - state importance. - And the factory plan isn't? You and your project - cut everything from us. - This is an empty conversation. You've made the engine. Test it and submit it. Easy to say. During the last test we almost went up in the air. What do you want from me practically? Get the project back to the institute. Temporarily, of course. I'm asking nicely. Otherwise we'll demand it in Moscow. Well, let Moscow settle us then. I bow before your selflessness. I'm surprised. But mark my words, this work will crush you. I don't think so. Dronov is more likely to crush anyone who dares to suggest to remove - the engine from the factory. - Why suggest it yourself? You need an order to come from above. While I'm the director, no paper slandering Dronov will leave these walls. Why slander? Not bad, impressive. By the way, there was a funny story I've heard about the workers of one institute. Got their advance payments, overpraised their project. But when it came to actually justifying the payments by meeting the deadline, alas... The bosses, as you understand, were furious. Unanswered hopes, bitter disappointment and the project got squished. Serves it right. Things happen.. Ah, Fyodor Alekseyevich... Everything would've been fine if not for his illness... And then... My baby! Yes? Fyodor Alekseyevich is not here. I don't know. He's not here. Fyodor Alekseyevich wasn't here. An accident... They were right in some things, I wrote that to Fyodor Alekseyevich. But hell knows how the factory workers are feeling. - Did he call you? - No. - Huh. Doesn't look like a nice conversation. Especially considering his health... - Quite, quite... - That's what's killing me. In any case, our goal is to get the factory to behave. And not to give them anything against Dronov. Fyodor Alekseyevich's health is... We can't not think about it. - What do we do? - Fight. Fight. We must write a report to the committee. Emphasise the project's successes. Its state importance, and the factory workers blabble about the hitches enough already. Basically, I think it won't hurt to exaggerate a little. At the end of the day, we do have a right to claim that the project is ready. The factory's criticisms are baseless and the engine could be expected - to produce an instant and massive effect. - Ready? Well, in principle. How come? In my note to Fyodor Alekseyevich - I've said the exact opposite. - Well, you're mistaking things. Your note to Dronov is our internal business. Self-criticism is only good at home. What I'm proposing is diplomacy. You think I should write this report? You're our representative at the factory, you get the cards. Still, Viktor... This idea of yours with the report... is not for me. That's right, pal. I understand you completely. But tell me, what to do? I'm asking you like a friend, not a director. Asya says the old man is very bad, he lives on hope only. His project is everything to him. So what, return the project? Ruin it all? Never. The workers are going to Moscow and I will too. I will fight there! Yes, yes! I will be sly, cunning! In any case, every extra day for the old man is worth dropping any delicacy. It'll get cold. Either your bureaucracy, or... - I have to hurry, old man. - Hurry where? I don't have much time. How is it? If you don't want to, don't write it. - Fine, I'll write it. - That's good, then. - If so, don't stall it. - I will give it to you to sign in two days. Great. Although wait... Ah, damn... Having memory loss already, tomorrow I leave to Moscow. That's fine. You'll sign it yourself. You have the right as our secretary. Just don't stall it. - Should I show it to Dronov? - God forbid. Under no circumstances. He'll never agree to praise himself. Well, and for understanding me, thank you. Thank you, friend. I'm caught! Come after me to the hospital. Can I change first? You see, I couldn't figure out where Vyazmin had his stint happen. His analysis of the incident is flawless. His conclusion couldn't be worse. I kept thinking, couldn't think of anything, but this morning suddenly something shot through my head. A thought, I mean. Something started coming up, but today was this procedure day. Had to hide. But I won't do it anymore, I swear. - Why are you angry? - Because we're doing everything, and you!... Everything? It's me who can bear everything! But can you do everything? All right, let's go get treated. Viktor Andreyevich, the situation is very serious. I spoke with the factory workers and got an impression that we need a different factory representative. Not Vyazmin. Aleksey Nikolayevich is very talented, but... soft, yielding. But here we need someone who can defend Dronov's work like their own life. Representation at the factory is a hard matter. Dangerous even. Who can you propose instead? Sorry, but myself. You know, I like your determination. And I think you're right. I myself started thinking that recently Alyosha, even if without realising, but he had lost interest in Dronov's work. There's no passion, no belief that I saw in your eyes just now. He is flawless, of course, but... You know, I thought... Could there be some issues between him and Dronov - Related to their personal lives? - Why are you saying this? Don't know, don't know. Although, Ksenia Petrovna, - Could I be frank with you? - Of course. You see, Ksenia Petrovna, dear. We all love Fyodor Alekseyevich very much, right? The talent, the energy... You cannot not love him. Well, I think that Vyazmin... Well, everybody knows that, he has feelings for you, and he thinks that you... So on. "So on" what? Well, as if you feel something towards Dronov that's more than we do. Did Vyazmin tell you that? Of course not, but he's my friend. Somehow I did learn to understand him without words. So I'm thinking if he's jealous of you because of Dronov. Even if without reason, I can get that. Bit jealousy is such a vile, such a senseless thing. Because of it even the weakest people can... So how about my proposal? Well, I promise to think about it, Ksenia Petrovna. I'll talk with Fyodor Alekseyevich. I think we'll decide in your favor. We think that the situation with group 24 requires an urgent inspection on site. - Signature. - Group one - Ready. - Group two. - Ready. - Group three. - Ready. Ready in 15 seconds. Stop. Stop! Stop the testing! Temporarily, of course. Until the commission's verdict. I'm sure, you hear? I'm sure! In this case I ask, I even demand to be included in the commission! No, no, I won't decline. I'll drive, I'll fly, anything and everything. That's right, report to the committee chair that the old man has gone mad and is asking for it himself. The boarding continues on flight TU-104 route Moscow-Novosibirsk. Break. - And the regime? - Can't you see the man is busy! Driving the man to the brink with their rotten regime. Maybe the man is getting something right. - Knock on wood. - Will you rest? - I won't. I'm calling the hospital. Fine. - I'm a man of discipline. - No doubt. - Did you invite Vyazmin at five? - Of course. Yes. Call after five. - Who called? - Didn't make it out. This woman will drive me insane. Try to nap. Did Rogozin come? The teacher with the roof repair? How is he? - Answer please! - They're stalling. - Did you call the regional office? - Yes, they promised after the 20th. The next century will also be after the 20th. - Did you tell them that? - Approximately. They promised in the following days. According to Einstein's theory of relativity, their following days are not the following days for Rogozin. Did you tell them that? Doubt they've heard of Einstein. I told them about the prosecutor. We agreed before the 25th. They said not to worry. But Rogozin voted me in so I would worry! Check around the 23rd, please. Hell knows what. Yes. Call after five. If I were you I'd address people by their name and patronymic. - It's more delicate, after all. - I'll be more delicate after five. Right, Tamara Ivanovna, Morgunov is flying here. Heard of that? - I did tell you. - That is right. He can't stand flying. What happened there? Moving? Moving. Vyazmin, Vyazmin, where've you been? By the river drinking gin. Had a glass and then had two Got his, what's this... Vyazmin, Vyazmin, where've you been... - How's the mood? - I'm not in the mood. Too bad! Too bad! You've made such a stellar analysis. But when it came to the conclusion, you got cold feet. And why? Because got...? - Got what? - Not what, but where. In your head, stew. Learn the classics. - What's your conclusion? - Bad. Dead end. - Can't hear. - Dead end. - Why are you yelling? Nothing to boast about. Remember, my dear friend, there are no dead ends in life. - A dead end can be here. - More like here. Here's your dead end. Are you busy? The regional office is calling about electricity in Marfino. About the letter to the First Regional Committee Secretary. - They're very angry. - Angry? - Listening. - Good day, comrade Dronov. Tell us, how did the First Secretary find out- I wrote to him. I love, you know, exchanging letters with high-ranking party members. - Why jump over us? - I did inquire! The Marfino people wrote to you thrice, no attention from you. So I went to the Secretary. Do you realise what trouble we're in now? We're being called to the Committee! You, in trouble? That's what I wrote to him for! But it's not good, not ethical! Is being a bureaucrat ethical? Is keeping a whole village without electricity ethical? Well, come to my reporting assembly to the voters and they will judge us on the ethics. Son of a bitch. Fyodor Alekseyevich! To be frank, I did struggle there. I'm simply a nitwit. You don't believe in that yourself. - Why didn't I find a solution? - Because a dead end. You immediately went "dead end!" Never do anything in the heat of the moment. - I owe you again. - Of course. I owe Morgunov, you owe me, and you'll get the next one. A relay race! - The nurse is here. - What? Injection again? - Who came? - Nadya. That's good. They have a redhead there, Zhanna, after her prick, pardon, you won't sit down! Nadya, good day! - Should I bend down? - Did it pass? Yes. Great. - You know, he's a genius. - I'm very glad. - Oh, we've been waiting! - What about me? Eh no, mother, there's a stronger magnet here. Hand first, then cheek, and then sure, the forehead. - And the lips? - Oh, oh! I'm afraid of Fedya! - Fine then. You can be next. - Hello there. My god, you're all bones now. - Why are you not looking after him? - I'm trying. That's right, there's nothing worse than a mathematician's wife. Right, I've read your work in the "Vestnik", not bad. And the final formula is just... fine wine. A treat for the brain and for the heart. Wait, Mikhail Borisovich, you're praising me but I don't understand anything. - Not so fast. - How cunning! - Did you arrive? - Sit down, you'll be safer. What a miracle. So many happy events in one day. - My arrival is a happy event? - Of course! - Uh huh... Anything else? - I'll tell you. Simply - Dronov is a genius. A regular genius. So, a commission has been created to investigate and to report to the committee. How come the project is deemed ready. But with no results. Is there a lie? A commission member is at your service. To be frank, the bosses are furious. Who is your representative at the factory? Now - Rumyantseva. I spoke to her over the phone yesterday, things are also bad there. Could she be panicky, that Rumyantseva? A woman, after all, the tender sex. No, she's a wonderful woman. So it had spread to there as well? Well, the commission will arrive soon, and I'm here so you can prepare. We've got nothing to hide. I don't doubt that. - But you have to prepare for the fight. - I pity the lost time. A commission... Pity to waste time. Who are you saying this to? I've got less time than you do. - Rumyantseva to you. - What? She's here too? Bring her in, please. - Good day. - Good day. Are you acquainted? - No. - Mikhail Borisovich Morgunov, my teacher. - Very glad. The factory halted all works on the project. - We need to fly to Moscow. - No, no. No need. Moscow will fly to you. - Here's a piece of it. - Do not worry that much. I swear, now things will be fine. Ask Vyazmin. Good day, Natalia Dmitrievna. Natasha, Ksenia Petrovna is saying hi to you. Excuse her, you know Natalia Dmitrievna can't hear well. I'll... Come next time. Please. Had a story recently with my wife. - She got jealous of me a bit. - Of you? What's so strange about it? See, Natasha's more tactful, she doesn't get surprised. My regular stenographer got ill so I got sent another one. The lady, I tell you, is a treat. A new blouse every day, but one thing is the same - the cleavage - is below all my abilities. - What? Nothing, moving on. So can you imagine, I notice that my old woman began feeling nervous. As soon as the stenographer arrives, Matilda rushes to the other room and listens attentively. Well, I chose a lucky minute and loudly said to the stenographer: "Dear lady, you keep glancing at me, bending lower than normal. That you find me attractive is not surprising, I'm an academic, after all. And then, my widow would get a nice pension." "So," I say, "I understand how I can be attractive to a young unmarried woman. But you, frankly speaking... How can you attract me? With your youth and beauty? In my time, don't take it as a boast, I've seen more. With your life experience? To say bluntly, talking with you is not much food for my brain. Another thing is my old woman. We've spent all our lives together, we catch everything about each other. I'm here having a nice chatter with you, but I know she's in the other room keeping her mouth shut so she won't sneer." Then my Matilda sneers and this lady turns red, grabs her purse and dashes to the door. I understood, how charming. - What happened next? - And next... Next, I will go and rest on my personal couch - If you don't object. - Of course, of course. Because after the plane... - Natasha, why did you do this to Rumyantseva? - Do what? She greeted you, and you didn't respond. - It was an accident, it happens to deaf people. - She's a good woman. And soon we might be celebrating her wedding. Really. Again? - Have we already? - No. She was married once. Who will she marry this time? You're not being nice. - Vyazmin, he's in love with her! - And her? - Is it mutual? - If I were a woman I'd fall head over the heels in love with him. You are not a woman. - But she also has eyes. - Sure. Will we keep talking about her eyes or change the subject? Let's change it, change it, dear Natasha! Right, your relative says hi. From Father Serafim, he's in Greece now. At the Peace Conference. He'll fly here soon. Just don't spend the entire evenings playing chess together. We don't just play, we also argue. Tell me, how do you feel now? You know, Natasha, I'm good. Even great. Just wait, we'll travel everywhere with you. To Greece, to London, around the Union. I am in my prime now. So many plans, projects! Enough for a century ahead, no less. If only we could take a peek at what will happen in 100 years, eh? Interesting. You know, I was away and I missed you... for some reason. Even your love confessions, if you want to know. You're dancing around with me. - A bit. - I understand, I know you don't love me. But it can't... There won't be a person who loves you more than I do, who needs you more than I do, Ksenia Petrovna. I... will do miracles if you will be with me. I remember everything about you, when and how you were dressed and styled. I can not look at you and still see how you walk, turn your head, think. You will love me, I know. I will work for it, I will deserve it. I'll become so important to you that it will be impossible not to love me. Hey, where are you going? A player! Huh... I won't make another Botvinnik. That's alright, Advanced Rank High Priest Serafim doesn't sound bad. You've brought us wonderful roses from Greece. Amazing, how did they not die? Truly, yesterday morning they were in the Athens, - in Moscow by evening, and today here in Siberia. - Miracles. There are no miracles. Technology. Technology, technology. You keep flying around. Aren't you afraid of stumbling upon an angel in the sky, huh? You, Fyodor Alekseyevich, keep making jabs at me. Could it be because there are unworthy people among the priests? They're not uncommon among scientists either. But you are not like that. Then accept that I can also be honest and sincere in my desire to bring people what they need the most - Belief in God. - Why are you so sure? That belief in God is what a man needs best? For a man's soul is empty without belief. Our souls are empty? In people like you - no, but you're the strong type, and you're strong because of what you do, it is akin to belief to you. But what about the weak? The ill? The desperate? The lonely? The abandoned? So you admit that your religion is for the weak only? Could it be all? Go to church and you'll see young people. The youth that seeks answers that you're not giving them. Or you do, but with dead words. But we answer instantly and soulfully. So what does it prove? Only that your strength is in our weaknesses. But that's fine, we'll end indifference too one day. But we have just as much soul! Where could you get it from? That soul? Marriage to us is a sacrament. To you it's registration in an office. Born - registration, married - registration died - registration. A human soul did not appear on this Earth for registration. And not for begging to return back to the sky. Everything around us was created by man. And it was created not with prayers, but despite them! - Do you know of the 7 Year Plan? - Of course. I'm sure you'll fulfill it. Satisfy the body. - But what about the spirit? - Hey, Serafim Nikolayevich, you're overdoing it. The Plan is for the body? It's also the spirit. Why are you separating them? Then why don't we watch over man together? You in body, us in spirit. - You don't value us. - We underestimate you, Serafim Nikolyaevich. Give you a soul and you'll drag the whole person away. Make him trust the supernatural forces again. But we rely on our own, human forces. No, Serafim Nikolayevich, our paths are different. I will become your wife, dear. - I will. - Do you know what you just said? Do you know who I am now? I'm... I'm the single happiest person on the planet. Eighteen hours thirty one minutes, July 27th. From now on, this day, this minute, I... will celebrate them. It will be my biggest celebration. You hear that? I do. And we know that humanity will achieve happiness only our way. Humanity - sure. But a single person? What reward, or how you call it, compensation, will you give a man for everything he had endured on earth? - Death! - Life! It's more generous than afterlife. The afterlife is a lie. A lie to you? I think not. Although, even if so, then it's the most ingenious, most humane legend created by humanity in its existence. Eternal life. Personal immortality and inevitable, triumphant justice. Not here - but There. It makes man live with no villainy. He isn't afraid of dying. He isn't trying to delay his death with the deaths of others. He lives with his conscience. He's got consolidation in life. For himself! And you? You took the belief in immortality away from man. You tell him: "You die and nothing awaits you further. What you live on this earth is all that you get. It's your grandchildren, your descendants that will live good". A weak person turns beastly, tries to grab everything that he has and has not a right to. Give him everything now, at any cost! The cost of theft, treachery, debauchery, betrayal. Murder! Why not? There's no God. There's no retribution. Well, well, well. So according to you, all our sorrows are because we have forgotten God? And how about the ones who haven't? Who remember? The Crusaders, the Inquisitors, the clergy. For all centuries they yelled "Do not desire", and desired. "Do not kill", and killed! Choked science and slaughtered nations with God's name on their lips. All God's to God, all Caesar's to Caesar, and for people - "I will repay". So answer me: hypocrisy, bigotry and crimes under the mask of piety - isn't this your legacy? You are uttering scary words. There is truth to them. But, again and again I keep asking you. How will you settle a human soul? So that a son won't leave his father, wife - her husband, brother - his brother. So that a student won't betray his teacher. So that the animalistic fear of death won't turn a man into a vile coward. To have something sacred in the soul. How will you manage? I can't fathom how it can be achieved without belief in God. - I can't. - And I can. With belief in man! Very cute. - Mikhail Borisovich! - Where's Fedya? - What happened? - Nothing. Well, about something sacred in one's soul... - Sorry, Fedya. - I object. We must find everything out immediately. The commission came and said that a report about your engine was submitted to the committee. Of a clearly promotional nature. Understandably outrageous. The project is on the brink of closure. Who could've signed this report? Wait, could it be the same report that I have written? Yes, it was signed by you. Why did you do this? What should I do, Viktor? Why are you addressing me? But didn't you and I... God forbid, Alyosha. Am I remembering things wrong? Remember about a month and a half ago you've met with the factory workers? You said they'd have to be subdued a little, so they wouldn't return the project, wouldn't call it unfinished. That's right. And you told me that you - partially agreed with them. - Yes. And that you're sending a report to Fyodor Alekseyevich about it all. Yes, I did get that note. Yes, back then I thought we've reached a dead end, and... Immediately submitted a report stating the opposite? Yes, it's... It happened... It was necessary because... Why? Because... Sorry, Fyodor Alekseyevich, I didn't anticipate such horrid consequences. I didn't. How awkward did it all turn out. Why did you write this report, after all? Later... I will explain later. Lowlife. You are such a lowlife. Aleksey Nikolayevich! What right did you have to insult him? I don't want to see you anymore. Fyodor Alekseyevich! We need to go after him! Alyosha, don't get angry. You could've at least talked with Fyodor Alekseyevich. He's gravely ill, bedridden. If I come it'll be worse. What to talk about anyway, mom? I have to leave. I can't live here. We can wait. We're being evicted but we still haven't got a reply from uncle Kostya. What if he can't take us in? He's your brother, he will take you in. What do you mean me? And you? Mom. You had to say goodbye to Fyodor Alekseyevich. He treats you like a son. I will with a letter. - When will that office guy come? - Soon. He will yell again. Why is he yelling? We're not arguing, we're packing. He's just like that. - It could be worse. - There he is. Accept a guest, Anna Pavlovna. - Fyodor Alekseyevich! What a surprise. - May I? Here, please. Where are you going? To a school during summer, then to uncle Kostya. He's my brother. Great. The uncle will sure be happy. You're ill, Fyodor Alekseyevich, why did you get up? Why I got up is none of your business, but why is there nowhere to sit? Lyosha. Right. - Everything else can stand. - But your health... Everything else can be quiet! Well, well... Moving to a school, then. And when kids return from holidays, you're moving to your uncle, so to say. Huh. The things you do "voluntarily". Some even resign, I hear. Tell me please, you're getting kicked out based on what exactly? They say by law. If the flat belongs to the state, and Lyosha quit... Just why hurry, though? But he keeps yelling. "Say thanks I found you a school". Did you go somewhere to complain? Did you check? Where can I go, Fyodor Alekseyevich? I have a son, thank god. - Lyosha doesn't want to go anywhere. - Eh, Lyosha. He's done his thing. Submitted his notice. By the way, will you feed the guest or not? With pleasure, Fyodor Alekseyevich, but everything is packed up in the kitchen. Unpack it then. You - there, and us in here. He also said that if we're not on time and won't be ready, he rests his case. "He" who? That one from the office. Troshkin! Just remembered his name. Rests his case... Tiresome fellow. Don't you know the laws or what? You're being lied to and you just pack up? Why didn't you come to me? For advice? Why did you fill out the voting ballot? Just for fun? Had nothing to do that day? Fyodor Alekseyevich. I'm not Fyodor Alekseyevich to you, I'm a High Council deputy. Your deputy, got it? Fine, this stunted fellow didn't, but you? You are a serious woman, why didn't you come to me? If you didn't want to see me, you could've written to the prosecutor. To the regional office, the city office, to the Committee, at the end of the day! Where do you live, people? In Portugal or in the Soviet Union? I just don't know what to do now. You? Now? Three fried eggs, no less. - Should this chest be in the middle of the room? - No. One moment. What's the office guy? Troshkin, but I think you shouldn- I don't care what you think. - Where can I get a piece of paper? - In the table's drawer. To Fyodor Alekseyevich Dronov (personally) From Vyazmin A.N. "Dear Fyodor Alekseyevich, you were always a teacher to me, an example and a father. But now, before I do what you will probably condemn, I ask you to forgive me and to do me a favor. In the folders there are projects, sketches, plans. Some of it will probably be useful. Sorry to bother you, but I ask to take care of my mother. All my money to her. Another favor. There is a bundle signed "To Rumyantseva" in my drawer. These are letters I wrote to her but never sent. She can read them when I'm dead." "She can read them when I'm dead". "Farewell, dear Fyodor Alekseyevich, take care. My last bow to Natalia Dmitrievna." What misfortune! Aleksey Nikolayevich! Alyosha! Vyazmin! - What happened? - Where's the son, Vyazmin!? What? Fyodor Alekseyevich, what's wrong? Dog. Dog, bastard. Get out of here. Wait, come back! Don't you dare step away from me. Will be schooling intelligentsia in a moment. Go in reverse for now. Not ready yet? Alrighty... Hey! We'll start loading now! You have to knock when you enter. - Who are you? - You have to say hi when you enter. - Who is this man? - This man? High Council Deputy Dronov. And you? I'm the regional office worker, Comrade Troshkin. You see, comrade scientist... Why did you come here? Regional office worker? Well... By law. Listen to me carefully, Troshkin. And remember once and for all that all of this is lawless. And you know it well. So, if you stick your nose here again, I will drop everything and focus on you. I won't leave it like that anyway. Now get out. I want to never see you again here. I will complain! Wait! Bring him back, now! Please! Come back! What did I teach you? When you enter, you knock. Got it? When you enter, not leave. Now leave properly. Just look at that! - Oh, the eggs! - We don't need the eggs. We need to, you know. Got it, Fyodor Alekseyevich. Get everything bad out of your head. We'll finish the tests and start on such things! There is someone to pass it all to. My flame, something sacred in my soul. We do have something sacred in our souls. It's exactly us who have it. It's a lie about non-belief and betrayal. Life is a battle! Everyone must ask themselves - "Why do you live"? "What are you fighting for?" And be ready to answer. - Then what's beyond is not scary... - What are you talking about? Nothing... Didn't finish arguing with one man. I will now. - Can you drink Bruderschaft? - Not sure. He can't do anything, huh. Right. And now... Now call me by informal "you". Ask something. Ask about my health. How's... - Health? - Whose? - N-uh... Don't tell me "n-uh", I'm not a horse. Come on, say "you". - Another time. - Another time, Fyodor Alekseyevich. Everything with you is another time. Eggs too. Come to me tomorrow morning. If I'm ill, if I'm not. In bed, not in bed, doesn't matter. We have something to do. I order you to take the notice back. "Voluntarily". Sure. Goodbye. He just came by. We drank Bruderschaft. He understood I didn't mean it. I swear! That's it, I'm clean before you now. What do you have to do with this? - What? But you and I... - You and I... He doesn't want to see me. Ksenia Petrovna. But I love him. Hear that? I love him! Whether he wants to see me or not. Don't care. And leave me alone! Once and for all! Aleksey Nikolayevich! Alyosha! Made it to the newest issue, good job. I'm ill, can't come. Yes, he's ill. I don't understand, how could you? As if nothing happened. Well, what did happen anyway? Vyazmin died, Fyodor Alekseyevich is bedridden and won't get up anymore. Rumyantseva is not herself. - And you... - What do I have to do with this? - Exactly. - What is this tone, Asya? I won't stand it. You will. You're a master of shutting everyone up. And me better than anyone else. But I will tell you everything now. - Oh, Asya, dear, let's le- - Stop it. What do you live for, Viktor? For whom? You never loved your own mother. It was me who sent her letters, money. It was me attending her funeral, while you excused yourself with a telegram. - "Grieving, no strength to come". - I was ill! - Just like now. And what about me? During hard times? - How did you behave, Viktor? - What do you mean? In 1953, when doctors were arrested. You don't understand what you're saying! You're so unjust! Remember, did I say even a word to you then? You were silent. But suddenly you stopped understanding me. Stopped appearing with me in public. But then doctors were reinstated and suddenly you were on board with me again. Well... Ah, fine... Sure. Perhaps you live for work. No. Your friend died. Teacher is dying. The project stalled. But you're only worried about one thing. For this entire story to not disturb your peace. You haven't killed or robbed anyone, you can't be accused of any crime. Everything you say is right. Has to be right. But, you strip everything of meaning with your indifference, you kill it all. A criminal can repent. An indifferent man can't. Criminal... Indifferent... Do you understand what you're saying? Forgive me, Asya, but I'm the most normal, most ordinary person. These grand people live sacrificially and for that get monuments even while they're alive. And the rest of us are egoists. But, we still do something useful for others. So don't judge me by the level I was never at. - People like me are the majority. - Lies. A person yearns to be needed by someone. Like a husband, a father, a friend, a teacher, a citizen. Otherwise he doesn't live, he exists. Understand this, Viktor! I don't. I don't understand what all of you want from me. If only you knew how tired I am of you. Asya, my dear, everything is so nice! I love you, you love me. And the rest... My god, they don't care for us. Come on, my dear. Asya, sweetie. Please, don't. You know... You're hopeless. Thank god we don't have children. Swine. Increase the pressure. Well, how are we feeling? You doctors are strange folk. Love to say "we" to the patients, but there's no "we". We feel differently. You better talk less. Oh no, let me talk it all out. With no rules, so to say. I don't know how will she... We'll travel everywhere with you. To Greece, to London, around the Union. I am in my prime now. I sure got lucky with my wife, right? You know, there is one saying. "Nothing is better in the world than a good wife, and nothing is worse than a bad wife". Does it apply to husbands too? It does. - Why did he...? - What to do! A fight. The weak fall, the indifferent desert. The rest fight. It all went by so quickly. - What? - Life. Pity. Here's my future. The future is life. There are people. They will pick it up. I pity Rumyantseva. How could she... Rumyansteva is not to blame. She was just a weapon. Oh, drop it, doctor, you should know better than anyone. A person is a living being, but a weapon might not even be. But he can do wrong precisely because he is living. She is energetic, smart, talented- But as a leader... - A leader must have another quality. - Which one? That's true. - Drink this. - Ah, with pleasure. I'm surprisingly eager to live. What if this thing helps, huh? - Oh, Fedya, you're doing great already. - Mikhail Borisovich. How many hours did the engine work? No news yet, but testing is still ongoing. Rumyantseva turned out to be ace as a scientist. As a scientist. But that's not enough. And Morozov - out! This one with his unshakable indifference to everything but himself is ready to ruin it all. Out and make it loud. For the sake of science. - Promise? - Promise. - That's a man's word. AUGUST I plead you. I beg. He already said he doesn't want to see you. But it's needed... for work. I insist. I demand. Do you know, Serafim Nikolayevich, why I asked you to come so urgently? I can't even guess. We didn't finish arguing. Remember back then, playing chess? Believe me, I regretted it sorely. I would've been glad to be wrong. I believe you, but let's continue still. Maybe not now? Hey, medicine, don't disturb! I'm allowed everything now. That's my own prescription. And it helps. So, where did we stop, Serafim Nikolayevich? Right, we talked about the absence of something sacred in the soul. - Unfortunately... - Sorry Fedya, Rumyantseva's here. She asks to be let in. She's begging, Fedya. For the sake of work. For work. Let her in. Speak. I... Said I'm here for work. It's the truth, and a lie. Truth because I report that testing was successful. That's the whole truth. And a lie... I didn't come for that. You should know that... I understood. I will never allow myself to insult a person with distrust. I understood that there are fragile people. I understood my fault. And I will repent for it my whole life. - And I... - Fine, later. How many hours did the engine work? - 100. - Fantastic. Do you know what's in this folder? Yes. Take it. So what were we... - Something... - We were talking about the absence of something sacred in the soul. It was you who talked about absence. It's not the time... or the place. It is time and place. Of course, consoling the defeated is, perhaps, a noble deed. But who will fight? Create? To fight and to create. That's why we live. Otherwise we're born for nothing. Existed for nothing and died forever. But the afterlife doesn't exist. Even the legendary one. There is nothing for man to do there, nothing to fight for. It's a foul, cowardly legend. Because it promises idleness for patience. Nonsense! Man needs to be told: whoever tells you to endure to get everything in the afterlife, is lying to you. You will die and never force them to answer. Remember that everything you have managed to do on this earth - that is your entire life. That is the only honest and brave conversation with man. Then man starts thinking: I've not done enough. Was I really born just for that? How am I living? Am I chasing symbols? Am I snatching away a piece from others so I can have two? For what? Why? I'm a stupid person. Why? Don't I know that I won't take anything with me to the other side? There is nothing there. All remains to people. The bad and the good. And in what I leave after myself is my oblivion or my immortality. THE END Original Russian subtitles: konst1 spiritcc
