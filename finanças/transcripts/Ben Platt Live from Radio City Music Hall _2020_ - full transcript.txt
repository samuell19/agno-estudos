I feel very overwhelmed because this is Radio City Music Hall. Yes, you've heard as well, I see. Um, and this is very crazy. Usually when I come up on a stage, ever since I was six or seven years old, I'm disguised as one thing or another. A very nerdy magician perhaps, or... Yes. Or a very strange Mormon missionary, or perhaps a kid with a broken arm. Oh, my gosh! I'm so glad that you've appreciated my work in Ricki And The Flash. But this year is the first time I've come on stage as myself, and be myself, because you decided to spend your night with me, so I can't thank you enough for letting me do that. It's wonderful. I grew up in a very large, very Jewish, very musical family. We were called the Von Platt Family Singers in our community. Many of them are here tonight. My brother Henry, and my sister Hannah, and my brother Avery, and my parents. So, when I decided to come out when I was 12, or just figured out I was gay, I didn't really decide to come out, it was really not a thing, no big deal. Lemme walk you through it. I was in eighth grade, I was on a trip to Israel, like you do in eighth grade... when you're a Jew. And a kid in my class, on my bus, during the trip made a comment to the effect of, like, "Oh, Ben is so lucky, because he's gay, so he gets to hang out with all the girls, and they let him in their hotel rooms, and they don't care..." And it was not a derogatory thing at all. It wasn't bullying, it was just true. Like, all my friends were girls, and they let me hang out with them. But the chaperone overheard this and thought it was a bad bullying incident and was gonna tell my parents, and I was like, "Lemme not have this be the first time that we discuss this. I don't want it to come up in this way, I want to get ahead of it." So I went back to my hotel in Tel Aviv, called my parents. I don't know what time it was for them, but it was important. And I said, "I have to tell you something." And my mom goes, "Is this about your sexuality?" I was like, "Let me finish!" And basically she said, "We know, you spent most of your childhood dressed as Dorothy from Wizard of Oz. No one is surprised." I was like, "Oh, that's great." She said, "I have all these books on my bedside table, I wanna read them." Which I thought was strange. And then she handed the phone to my father, who said, "Are you being safe?" And I said, "I'm 12, I don't know what you mean!" And that was really it. And I really wish for everyone in the world, everyone who's watching at home, everyone here tonight, that it can be that much of a nothing. Because it doesn't need to be an event, or an announcement... Thank you. Thank you very much. I agree. I thought you might, given that we're in New York City. Is there any queer people here tonight, perchance? When I was 18 years old, I dated someone who was in the closet, which, if you ask your queer neighbors, is sort of a rite of passage. I think we like the challenge, or something. Some of his embarrassment and discomfort rubbed off on me, and I really didn't like that. And I looked back on that experience, many years down the line, when I was writing this album, and I wrote this next song about how I wish I had approached that person and that experience, and how I would have spoken to him if I had had all of the knowledge and confidence that I now have as a medium adult, and it's called "Honest Man." ♪ There's something about you In moonlight ♪ ♪ But your eyes go so well with the day ♪ ♪ You won't let go of your layers ♪ ♪ But your power can strip me away ♪ ♪ It's easier for us to hide ♪ ♪ If you come out, then so will I ♪ ♪ Promise that I'll meet you halfway ♪ ♪ 'Cause I see every part of you ♪ ♪ And I can tell you see me too ♪ ♪ By the way that you say my name ♪ ♪ I am an honest man ♪ ♪ Why can't you take my hand? ♪ ♪ I'm not what you planned ♪ ♪ But I'm a safe place to land ♪ ♪ I am an honest man ♪ ♪ You're so afraid of tomorrow ♪ ♪ So you build your walls up today ♪ ♪ You won't believe that you're ready ♪ ♪ But I'd never lead you astray ♪ ♪ It's easier for us to hide ♪ ♪ If you come out, then so will I ♪ ♪ Promise that I'll meet you halfway ♪ ♪ 'Cause I see every part of you ♪ ♪ And I can tell you see me too ♪ ♪ By the way that you say my name ♪ ♪ I am an honest man ♪ ♪ Why can't you take my hand? ♪ ♪ I'm not what you planned ♪ ♪ But I'm a safe place to land ♪ ♪ I am an honest man ♪ ♪See me as I am ♪ ♪ Show me that I can ♪ ♪ You make me an honest man ♪ ♪ I know I've played with hearts before ♪ ♪ Don't have the heart To play with yours ♪ ♪ I only swear to do the best I can ♪ ♪ 'Cause when you put your trust in me ♪ ♪ How beautiful our love could be ♪ ♪ If only you would take a chance ♪ ♪ I am an honest man ♪ ♪ Why won't you take my hand? ♪ ♪ I'm not what you planned ♪ ♪ But I'm a safe place to land ♪ ♪ I am an honest man ♪ ♪ I am an honest man ♪ ♪ Why won't you hold my hand? ♪ ♪ I'm not what you planned ♪ ♪ I'm a safe place to land ♪ ♪ I am an honest man ♪ ♪ See me as I am ♪ ♪ Show me that I can ♪ ♪ You make me an honest man ♪ ♪ I've said all I can ♪ ♪ I am who I am ♪ ♪ And I am an honest man ♪ You knew there'd be a stool. ♪ I'm sure it was nothing ♪ ♪ But you never used to bring Somebody else along ♪ ♪ It used to be our thing ♪ ♪ Going to a movie, then we wander home ♪ ♪ All these little landmines ♪ ♪ All these little things That one can read two ways ♪ ♪ Like when you take every call outside ♪ ♪ Seems that I've forgotten How to read your face ♪ ♪ But I know you too well ♪ ♪ To get it wrong ♪ ♪ If you have to hurt me ♪ ♪ Hurt me once ♪ ♪ If you have to end it ♪ ♪ Get it done ♪ ♪ You have all these choices ♪ ♪ I have none ♪ ♪ You're all that I have to lose ♪ ♪ Couldn't hurt you if I wanted to ♪ ♪ I've decided on you ♪ ♪ If you keep it going ♪ ♪ Then one by one The memories will start to blur ♪ ♪ You'll ruin the good ones ♪ ♪ But I guess my photo album's None of your concern ♪ ♪ Don't humor me with kindness ♪ ♪ There's nothing kind about A hundred small betrayals ♪ ♪ If you love me at all ♪ ♪ You'll kill it now ♪ ♪ If you have to hurt me ♪ ♪ Hurt me once ♪ ♪ If you have to end it ♪ ♪ Get it done ♪ ♪You have all these choices ♪ ♪ I have none ♪ ♪ You're all that I have to lose ♪ ♪ Couldn't hurt you if I wanted to ♪ ♪ I've decided on you ♪ ♪ I've decided on you ♪ ♪ And if I'm disappointed ♪ ♪ It's 'cause you're not The person I knew ♪ ♪ If I had it my way ♪ ♪ I'd be kinder than you ♪ ♪ I'm sure I'll forgive you, and soon ♪ ♪ I'm ashamed but I'm proud of it, too ♪ ♪ I decided on you ♪ So, listen... Umm... Decided to have one Beyoncé, a little... sort of... not... I-- As you can tell by the last song, I really love to be in my feelings, as it were, use the music to process those sad things, which is important, and we should all do that, but I also think music is meant to help us feel ourselves. Is anyone feeling themselves this evening at Radio City? Yes! Cool, me too! Given that we're at Radio City-- One time, I dated this fellow, and he wasn't very nice to me, didn't treat me with a lot of respect. So... I wrote this song, and I felt a lot better. ♪ Wish that I'd known ♪ ♪ This feeling was coming ♪ ♪ When I was crying ♪ ♪ Over you ♪ ♪ Now that you're gone ♪ ♪ I carry nothing ♪ ♪ It feels like flying ♪ ♪ Boy, I used to throw a party Over every little thing you'd do ♪ ♪ Never going back Never going back to that ♪ ♪ Heartsick little lover boy Who went and lost himself in you ♪ ♪ 'Cause now I'm feeling so brand ♪ ♪ New ♪ ♪ New ♪ ♪ New ♪ ♪ I've never felt so brand ♪ - ♪ New ♪ - Say what? ♪ New ♪ Okay. ♪ New ♪ ♪ I never felt so brand ♪ ♪ I paid a price ♪ ♪ Worked and I wallowed ♪ ♪ Burned all your letters ♪ ♪ Just for fun ♪ ♪ All of that time ♪ ♪ Is easy to swallow ♪ ♪ Now that I'm better ♪ ♪ And somewhere in your room ♪ ♪ I left my virtue and my favorite shoes ♪ ♪ I don't want 'em back, Never give 'em back to me ♪ ♪ You can walk a mile in 'em ♪ ♪ Tell me how they feel on you ♪ ♪ I'll be busy being so brand ♪ ♪ New ♪ ♪ New ♪ ♪ New ♪ ♪ I've never felt so brand ♪ ♪ New ♪ ♪ New ♪ ♪ New ♪ ♪ I've never felt so brand ♪ ♪ So brand new ♪ ♪ I've never felt so brand ♪ ♪ So brand new ♪ ♪ Never felt so brand ♪ ♪ So ♪ ♪ Brand new ♪ ♪ So brand new ♪ ♪ I never felt so brand ♪ ♪ New ♪ ♪ Never felt so brand ♪ - ♪ New ♪ - Hey! ♪ New ♪ ♪ New ♪ ♪ Never felt so brand ♪ ♪ So brand new ♪ ♪ Never felt so brand ♪ ♪ So brand new ♪ ♪ I've never felt so brand new ♪ So, wherever that fellow is now, I hope that your life is one long line at the DMV. Just kidding, I hope you're well... Forgiveness. So... As you can tell by our little sort of... extraterrestrial living room situation we have going on, I really wanted this to feel as warm and welcoming as possible, and that you felt comfortable, and could have a good time, we could get to know each other, because I don't get to do that when I'm playing a character. Excuse me, water burps. So I just want to share some facts with you about myself that you might not know otherwise, just while we're here, so that you can leave feeling like you got a glimpse of who I am. Uh, I think that cats are the devil's children. Wow! Wow. Some cat haters. Bold. Uh, I just don't get them. They just sit there and make me sneeze. I, uh... What else? One time in eighth grade, I was at the mall, at the Discovery Channel store. I don't know if you know that-- If they had that here. We used to go for the massage chairs a lot, and there was this Halloween cauldron glass thing, and I was like, "This is like Wicked." So I did this Elphaba over it, and then I knocked it over, shattered it, and got kicked out of the mall. One time when I was at Jewish summer camp-- Anybody go to Jewish summer camp, perchance? The Harry Potter books all usually came out during the summer and the sixth one came out, and mine wasn't coming in the mail, Mom and Dad, and everybody else's was coming, and I was hearing about what was gonna happen and I was getting really upset, so in the dead of night, there was another kid in my bunk whose name was also Ben-- I stole his copy and I wrote my last name in it. And I got away with it. So... to Ben something-Jewish-last-name, I'm very sorry. What else? One time, I went on a trip with my best friend Molly, and we had these weed gummies, like, the little square weed gummies, and it's like a square, but you're supposed to pick off a corner and eat it, but I thought it was like, "I'll pop the whole square." Um... And given my general Judaism and anxiety, I don't do well in that situation. So it didn't go well. I started to panic. I was asking her, "How long-- Like, how long has it been?" She's like, "30 seconds since you last asked me." And then... What else happened? All of a sudden I was like, "I need crab cakes. have to eat crab cakes." And so she ordered some to the room. I was like, "I can't interact with the man bringing them." So I hid in the bathroom while they came. And then they came, and my mouth was so dry because of the gummy that it just fell directly out of my mouth. I couldn't even swallow it. Anyway, we're all friends now. Lastly, I never understood the stakes of sports, really. I used to play soccer when I was a kid. My parents wanted me to be well-rounded. They encouraged me to try new things. They would bribe me to go to practice by giving me a McFlurry every time I went. But I spent most of the games throwing the chalk that delineates lines up in the air as though it was fairy dust. So... there were some clues. When I'm in my own living room at home, I like to sing songs by other artists, which I'd love to do now. One of my favorite artists-- Also a queero of mine, if you will, trademark-- Her name is Brandi Carlile... Yes, I agree. And she wrote this wonderful, fantastic song that I think everyone has really found themselves in. It's called "The Joke," and I'd love to sing it for you now. ♪ You're feeling nervous Aren't you, boy? ♪ ♪ With your quiet voice ♪ ♪ And your impeccable style ♪ ♪ Don't ever let them steal your joy ♪ ♪ Or your gentle ways ♪ ♪ To keep them from running wild ♪ ♪ They can kick dirt in your face ♪ ♪ Dress you down and tell you That your place is in the middle ♪ ♪ When they hate the way you shine ♪ ♪ I see you tugging on your shirt ♪ ♪ Trying to hide inside of it ♪ ♪ And hide how much it hurts ♪ ♪ Let 'em laugh while they can ♪ ♪ Let 'em spin ♪ ♪ Let 'em scatter in the wind ♪ ♪ I have been to the movies ♪ ♪ I've seen how it ends ♪ ♪ And the joke's on them ♪ ♪ You get discouraged, don't you, girl? ♪ ♪ It's your brother's world ♪ ♪ For a while longer ♪ ♪ You gotta dance with the devil On a river to beat the stream ♪ ♪ Call it living the dream ♪ ♪ Call it kicking the ladder ♪ ♪ They come to kick dirt in your face ♪ ♪ Dress you down and then displace you ♪ ♪ After carrying your baby on your back Across the desert ♪ ♪ I saw your eyes behind your hair ♪ ♪ And you're looking tired ♪ ♪ But you don't look scared ♪ ♪ Let 'em laugh while they can ♪ ♪ Let 'em spin ♪ ♪ Let 'em scatter in the wind ♪ ♪ I have been to the movies ♪ ♪ I've seen how it ends ♪ ♪ And the joke's on them ♪ ♪ Let 'em laugh while they can ♪ ♪ Let 'em spin ♪ ♪ Let 'em scatter on the wind ♪ ♪ I have been to the movies ♪ ♪ I've seen how it ends ♪ ♪ And the joke's on ♪ ♪ Them ♪ Hey!

That was another song about... a torrid affair. No, I just... Just not my favorite situation. But anyways, in that situation, like in any relationship situation, I got back on the horse right away. I got back on the apps. Hinge... It's strange to be on the apps now, because people are like, "Are you catfishing me?" And I'm like, "I'm just trying to find somebody." But... I am-- Does anyone watch Sex in the City? Good, and if you don't, look at your choices. I, um... I'm a Charlotte, which means that when I go on a good date, one date, a first date, and it goes well, I'm picking out china patterns, children's names... like, grave plots... I go all-in very quickly. It's been referred to before as "stalking." Or "deeply uncomfortable." I like to refer to it as just a very deep enthusiasm.

But moving on... Thank you for that. That was so beautiful. Hi, everyone up there. Hello! You guys are the best! Okay, a couple of quick things. First of all, can we talk about these singers for one moment? Like... I will never understand why they are slumming it with me. Secondly, it's all about transparency, honesty, whatever... Uh, I was peeing while that was happening. I was indeed peeing. You've seen all the water, it doesn't go nowhere. I just felt like I was being dishonest if I didn't tell you that. Thirdly, that last song is very, very special to me. As someone who deals with anxiety a lot, which I'm sure many of us do, living in New York and being largely Jews, it's a song that really quells my anxiety. So I hope it does the same for you. Um... Now, I would love to sing a song that is a little bit newer. Maybe some of you know what I'm talking about. I just put it out this summer, and it brought me a lot of joy... and a lot of dance, and I hope it does for you. It's called "Rain." That's right. You read my mind. ♪ You say you've been Through this before ♪ ♪ You gave away all your secrets ♪ ♪ To someone Who up and left you in pieces ♪ ♪ I know the feeling, believe me ♪ ♪ I know the prices you've gotta pay ♪ ♪ I'm sacrificing my freedom ♪ ♪ And all just to get somebody to see me ♪ ♪ Nobody said it was easy ♪ ♪ My heart's been broken and broken And broken and broken ♪ ♪ But I keep, keep on hoping and hoping And hoping and hoping ♪ ♪ That if it keeps on breaking And breaking ♪ ♪ And breaking and breaking ♪ ♪ Then one day it'll open And open and open ♪ ♪ And open and open for you Hey! ♪ ♪ I know we've both been afraid ♪ ♪ But we can't run from the wind And the thunder ♪ ♪ When we're dancing under the rain ♪ ♪ The rain, the rain ♪ ♪ Hey! ♪ ♪ I know we got what it takes ♪ ♪ Ain't gonna run from the wind And the thunder ♪ ♪ When we're dancing under the rain ♪ ♪ The rain, the rain ♪ ♪ We're dancing under the rain ♪ ♪ Breathe deep, let it wash over you ♪ ♪ We're slowly becoming lovers ♪ ♪ I promise you We won't be like the others ♪ ♪ We won't go running for cover ♪ ♪ My heart is broken And broken and broken and broken ♪ ♪ But I keep, keep on hoping And hoping and hoping and hoping ♪ ♪ That if it keeps on breaking And breaking ♪ ♪ And breaking and breaking ♪ ♪ Then one day it'll open And open and open ♪ ♪ And open and open for you Hey! ♪ ♪ I know we've both been afraid ♪ ♪ But we can't run from the wind And the thunder ♪ ♪ When we're dancing under the rain The rain, the rain ♪ ♪ Hey! ♪ ♪ I know we got what it takes ♪ ♪ Ain't gonna run from the wind And the thunder ♪ ♪ We're dancing under the rain The rain, the rain ♪ ♪ We're dancing under the rain ♪ ♪ Broken and broken And broken and broken ♪ ♪ We're dancing under the rain ♪ ♪ Hoping and hoping ♪ ♪ Dancing under the rain ♪ ♪ Breaking and breaking and breaking ♪ ♪ Then one day it'll open And open and open ♪ ♪ And open and open for you ♪ ♪ Hey! ♪ ♪ I know we've both been afraid ♪ ♪ But we can't run from the wind And the thunder ♪ ♪ We're dancing under the rain The rain, the rain ♪ ♪ Hoping and hoping And hoping and hoping ♪ ♪ The rain, the rain, the rain ♪ ♪ Dancing under the rain ♪ Thank you, you're very sweet. We love you! I love you too, and that was so well timed. I'm gonna come down a little bit closer for this next song, to everyone. Hello. Hello, everybody. Good sweatshirt. This next song... is quite special to me, and has kind of a multitude of meanings that kind of crossroad. The first being I just-- I really love my father very much. My dad is the greatest. He's a wonderful person. And he's taught me many things, not the least of which is that being a decent human being comes far before being a decent artist, and it's only possible to be a decent artist if you are a decent human being. And I... I try to act that way in my life, and he somehow has magically maintained that throughout his entire life. And I really wanted to write about how much I loved him. And thankfully he's here tonight, and he's very wonderful, and very much-- I'm not gonna... Anyway... So that's one idea. The other idea, which is very separate, is saying things before it's too late to say them. Saying things now while we can. We don't know what's going on. The world's very crazy. Particularly this country, at the moment, is up in arms and very insane. And I get very overwhelmed by it, and I sometimes forget to say to the people around me how I feel, because I take it for granted that they know. And this song has now become very irrevocably linked to my Grandma Sue, who passed away in the spring, and... She was the greatest grandmother, just everything you could ever wish for. The most wonderful human, world-class back tickler... She peed her pants once playing Twister. She's just the most wonderful person you could possibly imagine. And so, naturally, the fact that this tour came right after... I know she would've wanted to be here. She encouraged me to do what I love. She always reminded me to try to enjoy it. She knows that I live very much in my head. She would always say to me to enjoy what you're doing, because that's the whole point. So I'd just love to dedicate this to her. ♪ You put all your faith in my dreams ♪ ♪ You gave me the world that I wanted ♪ ♪ What did I do to deserve you? ♪ ♪ I follow your steps with my feet ♪ ♪ I walk on the road that you started ♪ ♪ I need you to know that I heard you ♪ ♪ Every word ♪ ♪ I've waited way too long to say ♪ ♪ Everything you mean to me ♪ ♪ In case you don't live forever Let me tell you now ♪ ♪ I love you more than you'll ever Wrap your head around ♪ ♪ In case you don't live forever ♪ ♪ Let me tell you the truth ♪ ♪ I'm everything that I am Because of you ♪ ♪ I, I've carried this song in my mind ♪ ♪ Listen, it's echoing in me ♪ ♪ But I haven't helped you to hear it ♪ ♪ We, we've only got so much time ♪ ♪ I'm pretty sure it would kill me ♪ ♪ If you didn't know the pieces of me Are pieces of you ♪ ♪ I've waited way too long to say ♪ ♪ Everything you mean to me ♪ ♪ In case you don't live forever ♪ ♪ Let me tell you now ♪ ♪ I love you more than you'll ever Wrap your head around ♪ ♪ In case you don't live forever ♪ ♪ Let me tell you the truth ♪ ♪ I'm everything that I am Because of you ♪ ♪ I have a hero whenever I need one ♪ ♪ I just look up to you and I see one ♪ ♪ I'm a man 'Cause you taught me to be one ♪ ♪ In case you don't live forever ♪ ♪ Let me tell you now ♪ ♪ I love you more than you'll ever Wrap your head around ♪ ♪ In case you don't live forever ♪ ♪ Let me tell you the truth ♪ ♪ I'm everything that I am ♪ ♪ Oh ♪ ♪ In case you don't live forever ♪ ♪ Let me tell you the truth ♪ ♪ As long as I'm here as I am ♪ ♪ So are you ♪ ♪ If you feel that it's real ♪ ♪ I'm on trial ♪ ♪ And I'm here in your prison ♪ ♪ Like a coin in your mint ♪ ♪ I've been dented and I'm spent ♪ ♪ With high treason ♪ ♪ Through a glass eye your throne ♪ ♪ Is the one danger zone ♪ ♪ Take me to the pilot for control ♪ ♪ Take me to the pilot of your soul ♪ ♪ Take me to the pilot ♪ ♪ Lead me through the chamber ♪ ♪ Take me to the pilot ♪ ♪ I am but a stranger ♪ ♪ Take me to the pilot ♪ ♪ Lead me through the chamber ♪ ♪ Take me to the pilot ♪ ♪ I am but a stranger ♪ ♪ Na, na, na ♪ ♪ Na, na, na ♪ ♪ Na, na, na Na, na, na ♪ Come on! ♪ Na, na, na ♪ ♪ Na, na, na ♪ ♪ Na, na, na Na, na, na, na ♪ Whoo! ♪ Well I know he's not old ♪ ♪ And I'm told ♪ ♪ Told that he's a virgin ♪ ♪ Well he, maybe she ♪ ♪ So I'm told ♪ ♪ But I'm never, never certain ♪ ♪ Through a glass eye your throne ♪ ♪ Is the one danger zone ♪ ♪ Take me to the pilot for control ♪ ♪ Take me to the pilot of your soul ♪ ♪ Take me to the pilot ♪ ♪ Lead me through the chamber ♪ ♪ Take me to the pilot ♪ ♪ I am but a stranger ♪ ♪ Take me to the pilot ♪ ♪ Lead me through the chamber ♪ ♪ Take me to the pilot ♪ ♪ I am but a stranger ♪ ♪ Na, na, na, na, na, na ♪ ♪ Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na ♪ ♪ Na na na, na na na Na na na na na na na na ♪ Whoo!

The man. Cool. This is so fun, I wanna slow down, but let's keep going. So, this song is one of my favorite songs. I saw it on a sign earlier. And I wrote it at a time when I was at a crossroads in a relationship, when the person I was with said to me, "I need to go and be on my own, 'cause I need to grow and become who I'm going to be. I need space to do that." Shouldn't have said "grow." And in our case that was very valid, and it was the right thing to do. We were great friends, and it was the right move. But I think a lot of times, that's sort of a cop-out that gets used in relationships, whether they be platonic or romantic, of, like, "I need to get some space from someone, in order to become who I am." Hopefully, if you're in the right relationship, you can both find room to grow and become who you are and ebb and flow, and give each other space when necessary, and... So, if you're in that relationship now, or you're with that person tonight, I'm very happy for you, and that's wonderful, and this song is for you. And if you're like me, and you haven't found that person yet, this song is also for you too. Feel free to sing it, if you know it. ♪ You say there's so much you don't know ♪ ♪ You need to go and find yourself ♪ ♪ You say you'd rather be alone ♪ ♪ 'Cause you think you won't find it Tied to someone else ♪ ♪ Who said it's true ♪ ♪ That the growing only happens On your own? ♪ ♪ They don't know me and you ♪ ♪ I don't think you have to leave ♪ ♪ If to change is what you need ♪ ♪ You can change right next to me ♪ ♪ When you're high, I'll take the lows ♪ ♪ You can ebb and I can flow ♪ ♪ And we'll take it slow ♪ ♪ And grow as we go ♪ ♪ Grow as we go ♪ ♪ You won't be the only one ♪ ♪ I am unfinished I've got so much left to learn ♪ ♪ I don't know how this river runs ♪ ♪ But I'd like the company Through every twist and turn ♪ ♪ Who said it's true ♪ ♪ That the growing only happens On your own? ♪ ♪ They don't know me and you ♪ ♪ You don't ever have to leave ♪ ♪ If to change is what you need ♪ ♪ You can change right next to me ♪ ♪ When you're high, I'll take the lows ♪ ♪ You can ebb and I can flow ♪ ♪ And we'll take it slow ♪ ♪ And grow as we go ♪ ♪ Grow as we go ♪ ♪ Grow as we go ♪ ♪ Grow as we go ♪ ♪ I don't know who we'll become ♪ ♪ I can't promise It's not written in the stars ♪ ♪ But I believe that when it's done ♪ ♪ We're gonna see that it was better ♪ ♪ That we grew up together ♪ ♪ Tell me you don't wanna leave ♪ ♪ 'Cause if change is what you need ♪ ♪ You can change right next to me ♪ ♪ When you're high, I'll take the lows ♪ ♪ You can ebb and I can flow ♪ ♪ We'll take it slow ♪ ♪ And grow as we go ♪ ♪ Grow as we go ♪ ♪ Grow as we go ♪ ♪ Grow as we go ♪ Thank you. Sad news to report, I have one more number for you. - Aw! - I know, I'd love to stay. This has been like... I don't wanna talk about it, 'cause I don't wanna cry, and I have to sing another song, but it's just like... I look out at everybody, and think about what's happening right now, and I can't believe it's my life. Thank you so much for coming. Thank you. So... We love you! Oh, my god. Careful, nodes! Careful! Thank you so much, though. So, before I tell you about the last song, I wanna thank the people with me one more time. This is an incredibly scary thing to do. And to have these people holding me musically, emotionally, physically, everything, has been an absolute dream come true. and I'll never be able to repay you for doing this journey with me and playing here with me, it's amazing. So, I started working when I was very young, when I was about nine years old, and I was in a real rush to grow up. I had a lot of older siblings who were super cool, and I was always working with adult cast members, and I just always wanted to be older, very quickly. And I got that-- Oh, I said older, and I got my wish. I grew up very quickly, I started working, as soon as I got out of high school I started living on my own, and the last couple years, looked back, and was, like, a little frustrated, 'cause I was like, "I wish I had taken a bit more time, to be reckless, and a little more youthful, and not looked ahead quite so determinedly, if that's a word." And then I got doubly frustrated, because I looked at all the points in my life in which I was looking forward, looking backward, looking anywhere but where I was. And as I've said a bajillion times, I'm a very anxious person, so I live very much in my head, and I have a really hard time being present where I am. And one of the number one ways, most special ways, for me to do that is to sing music and play music. So you've given me a gift by coming here and letting me do that for you tonight. And I hope, if anything else, this hour and a half or whatever it's been has helped you forget your worries and troubles and just be here with me. And I hope this song does the same.

I love you too, but please, drink some Throat Coat. Thank you guys so much for all of your love and for standing, and all of that beautiful stuff. It was... it's insane. This one more song we'll play for you is the last song on my record, and it's the first song I ever wrote in earnest, from my own perspective, and by myself, and naturally, the first thing that I thought to write about was my parents. Who, as I've said, are here. And I'm not going to point again, but I'm sure it's been ruined. They are incredibly beautiful people, and everything that I have, I have them to thank for it. They named me Baruch Shirah in Hebrew, which means "blessed song." So, well done. It went well. And I think it's very emblematic, the gift of that name, of everything that they've given me, not least of which is an understanding that music is something that really can bring people together, and can help you see someone in a way that you don't expect to, and see somebody's perspective. We grew up with musical theater in the house all the time, and I think the greatest gift of them giving us that is when a character sings, you get to see inside of them. You get to see their soul. And... I think I don't know what I would be like if I didn't grow up with that knowledge, and with their love. So, this is inspired by them. Thank you again for having me. This has been so wonderful.
