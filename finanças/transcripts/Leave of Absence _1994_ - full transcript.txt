(ambient music) (bright classical music) (wine splashes) (kernels clatter) (door slams) (music swells) (kernels popping) (bright classical music) - [Elisa] Sam, not too much butter! (butter splashes) Not too much salt! Don't forget the tape deck! (remote clicks) - Popcorn, just the way you like it. - Ah... No, thank you. - Why not? - Too much salt. - How do you know? You haven't even tried it. - It's always too much salt. - I'll get you something to drink. - No, thank you. - How about I put some music on the stereo? - No, thank you. (chuckling) You wanna talk. - Very perceptive. - Mm-hmm. - What would I do without you, huh? - Hm, eat too much popcorn, too much butter, too much-- (groans) - I wanna ask you something. You don't think that I'm shallow, do you? - It doesn't sound like you have much choice. (Sam chuckles) You know, it's a decision made by the board of directors. But don't you have a say as a partner? - No, no, no. Look, I don't mind working for another firm. I'm happy to do a good deed for the city. It doesn't even bother me nobody's gonna make any money on this deal, but you know, they teamed me up with an architect I've never met, from some company I've never heard of. The guy's supposed to be some kind of a lunatic. (TV chatters) - He's an architect, how much of a lunatic can he be? - (grunts) NB, he goes by the initials NB, right? He works out of some kind of an abandoned garage. I get to see, he lives in a tent up on the roof. - Well, you always say architecture's about change. - Yeah, well architecture can change all at once, all right? I'd like to do my good deed for the city without turning my life inside out, thank you very much. (Sam grunts) And the board says, "Well, we can't work in a garage, so we'll make space for him and some of his people on your floor, starting this week." We're not jammed up enough down there. (Sam groans) - What? - I think you might be a teeny, tiny bit shallow. - (sighs) Let's talk about something else. - Fine. - Sex. - You wanna talk about sex? - (groans) When's Zoey coming home? - Tomorrow. (kisses) - Ah, that should be enough time. - Let's make some noise. (chuckles) (kisses) Mm. Well, all I can do is give you my opinion. (phone rings) No, no, you're absolutely right, (stammers) it's totally subjective. Yeah. (phone rings) All right, well look, we wanna wish you the best. All right, yeah, sure. (phone clicks) What do you wanna bet they go through a dozen architects, they'll still hate the building? - No bet. Chairman of the Asian Heritage Council. - (sighs) Yeah. - And-- - Wait, wait, wait, what is it? These are the calls just from this morning? - Friday; the chairman's-- - Well, why didn't I see them on Friday? - Because you weren't here. - Where was I? - You were playing golf with Elisa at Meadowlands. - Yeah, that's right. (phone rings) - Well, you know, memory loss is part of the normal aging process. - Well, thank you for sharing that. I'm sorry, what's your name again? All right, fellas, let's start with the chairman of the Asian, whatever. - Crap, crap, crap. (phone rings) - [Elisa] Something wrong, Bess? - I bet if I had sex more often, I wouldn't be so disorganized. - Really? I didn't know there was a correlation between, what is it? Frequency of intercourse and organizational skills? (laughs) - Go ahead, laugh. You're married to a man who can't keep his hands off you. Look at your desk. (chuckles) I'm married to a guy who pats me on the shoulder every fiscal quarter, and I just scheduled two school tours on the same day, at the same time. - Bring me the paperwork, I'll see what I can do. - Don't you think you oughta stop this volunteer saint routine and take the paying job they're offering? - If I take the paying job, I have less flexibility. - [Bess] And a bigger office. - And that means less time with Sam! Besides, I hear they already hired somebody. - They hired someone else for your job? - Bess, this is my job. (phone rings) And I have more than enough work to do, so why don't you get me your paperwork so I can get back to mine? - In 30 years, I never understood you. - [Employee] Metropolitan Art Museum. (upbeat piano music) - Yeah, you're absolutely right, Zoey. You are treated differently because you're my daughter. Anybody else who was this late would have been fired! (phone rings) Look, I'm not saying that it's-- - Dad, I got the message! - You're the only intern we have around here. You happen to be my daughter, it just doesn't look good. - Okay, okay, okay, okay! How do I look? - You look fine, how do I look? - Uptight, (sighs) as usual. (sighs) Hi, how are you? - Zoey! - How are you? (talking over each other) - Guys, sorry we're late. (jazzy piano music) (sniffs) (phone rings) - Maybe I should call again. - Why don't we just reschedule? I really, I have a lot of stuff that uh-- - NB! (phone clatters) (door slams) (panting) - Very late and very sorry. - You're a woman. - Yeah. (pants) There was an old man, crossing on the crosswalk in front of my car. One minute he was upright, the next minute he was down. I dialed 911, four firetrucks arrived and the paramedics started treating him for heart failure. Turned out, he had gas. (employees laugh) I'm Nell Bergen, a woman. You must be Sam Mercer, the man. (phone rings) - Ah, this is my daughter, Zoey. - How do you do? (sighs) You're an architect? - Yeah no, actually she's our new intern. - Well, an aspiring architect. - She's a sociology major at Brown. She's taking a semester off. - Can she talk? - As a matter of fact, I can. My field is urban social dynamics. - Good, well when you graduate, you can come and work at the center we design. - Hm. - It's gonna be really terrific, and I don't just mean the way it looks. You've met my assistant, David Su. Miss Cora Windsor, who of course is very modest, but in truth came up with the entire idea for the center. - Nell had some good ideas, as I recall. - So what did you talk about before I arrived? - The uh, Lovell House, Neutra, 1927. - Ah, very close, but it took two years to build. Completion date was 1929. If this project is as successful as we hope, it could become a model for community centers nationwide. - Really? - Yes. (papers rustle) Don't you know about the center? - No, not much, not really. Don't your interns get briefed on ongoing projects? - (grunts) Well, usually they do but-- - Wait, aren't you the one who never turned up for any of the meetings we had on this project? - I guess I must be. (chuckles) - Hm. (Zoey chuckles) - Well, on the face of it, it's a regular recreation center but applicants have to attend classes, given on the premises at no charge, designed to teach life lessons. When a member has completed all the classes offered, they can remain at the center by becoming a volunteer. - Wow, that sounds really great. - What is not clear to me is how you get a feel of what needs to happen architecturally when you haven't the faintest idea of what the structure you're designing is about. (jazzy piano music) - She's not that weird. Nell is (stammers) dynamic. - Dynamic, she's a dynamic pain in the ass. She's been there for a week. She's rearranged the coffee room already. - Everyone says it's better. - Uh-huh, well, she put these humongous set of stereo speakers in her office. - She uses music as an inspiration. - Oh. (scoffs) - She, a lot of people do! Zack does it when he sky dives. - Oh, I see. (stammers) She wears napkins in her hair. - What? (laughing) - They're not napkins, Dad, they're bandanas. - They're napkins, okay? I saw him 'em at Bess and Murray's picnic. We used 'em to wipe our mouth, they're napkins. - Okay. - Look, (stammers) she's got her own style and she's successful. (knife clicks) And she wasn't wrong about you missing those community meetings, either. - Oh, she wasn't, huh? - I wouldn't mind being like her when I grow up. - Oh now, that's a hell of a thing to say right here in front of your mother. - Oh. - Dad, there are other women in the world besides Mom. - I love it when you two talk about me like I'm not here. - (scoffs) Besides, I didn't say Nell was better. She's just different. (Sam scoffs) - Yeah, she really is or she tries to be? - Aha. - She doesn't see things like other people, you know? She's, (stammers) I don't know, real... alive! - Hmm. - You'd like her, mom. - Oh yeah, yeah, you'd love her. - She thinks Dad's a stuffy old fart. - Zoey! I've known that about your father for years. (chuckling) - Hey, hey, hey, hey! - How do we know this isn't just some showcase for your businesses to come in here, put up a bunch of walls and hang plaques of who donated what? - You don't. Which is why you all need to muster up some trust, mix it with some responsibility, and participate in this project so walls of plaques don't happen. - A lot of promises made to this community been broken. - Yeah, tell 'em. - That's right! - Hold it, now, nobody up here is denying the fact that this community has been treated badly for too many years. - Mm-hmm. (crowd murmurs) Just as nobody up here can absolutely guarantee that every promise that you've heard today is going to be kept. - That's what I'm sayin'! - But I will promise you this. This recreation center is going to be built. - Yeah, right. - Which is why we're here. I mean, we're here because we want your participation. We want your ideas. We want your comments, we want your complaints. We want your help. (siren wails) Now, I don't know if this suggestion has been made yet because I missed the earlier meetings, for which I apologize. (crowd murmurs) Suppose we set up a separate telephone line and we plaster the phone number all over the neighborhood. Right, then if anybody's got any ideas or comments or criticisms, all they have to do is pick up the phone and call it in. What do you think? (talking over each other) - I don't know. - I think it's a great idea. - Uh-huh. (car sputters) - [Nell] Try it again. - 'Kay. (car sputters) No. - [Nell] Ah, I'm gonna need a tow. - Okay, I'll see if I can find a phone. - Wa-hoo! (truck rumbles) (brakes screech) Hey, sweet thing. (country music) Nice wheels. - Thanks, you think so? - I'm a parts expert, I know so. - Well I ought to tell you, I'm not interested in a casual liaison. I'm looking for a serious, long-term commitment. Are you interested? - Let's go, Luther. (truck rumbles) - (laughs) Works every time. (hood slams) I'm starved, let's eat. (Sam sighs) (calm music) Mm, excellent, thank you. - You always eat other people's food? - Well, if they offer. Is your wife always out at dinner time? - Uh, my wife's at a meeting. She's a volunteer at the museum, and she's a gourmet cook. - I'm a horrible cook, but I'm a gourmet eater. (chuckles) - Mm. After ruling out some places that should probably be closed to health authorities, I finally found great takeout 'round the office. - Oh, (chuckles) you like takeout? - Yep, I love takeout. And working late, and small adventures. (Sam clears throat) - If you appreciate things that are young and tender, the baby squid is excellent, would you like some? Thanks for the lift, by the way. - Uh, it's okay. And I have to say that those gentlemen, well, they weren't wrong about you. Wheels, uh, legs. (chuckles) - Well, here's to conflict resolution. Architectural and otherwise. (crowd chatters) (glasses clink) (both slurping) - Ah. (bright percussive music) Workin' late on a Friday. - You're working, too. - Ah, well, Zoey and her mother are on kind of a ladies' night out. You know, so here I am. - That was a very interesting lecture you gave at the library last week. - Oh, thank you, I didn't see you there. - Well, I was draped in black. Didn't want you to be distracted by my legs. - Uh-huh. (chuckles) Tell me something, you really like this music? I mean, that's surprises me. (snickers) - What surprises me is that we're working together on a rather large project, and you don't have the, the slightest clue about my work or what it means to me. - Well then, why don't you tell me? - Why don't I show you? - Are we going somewhere? - Yep. (bright percussive music) A visit to a genuine architectural treasure. (stereo clicks off) - Ah, that's much better. I bet you like rap music too, right? - (chuckles) Absolutely, especially the ones about judgmental, male architects. (crickets chirping) (gate creaks) (dog barks distantly) (gentle acoustic music) (laughing) (crickets chirping) I sneak in here all the time. I found a reference to it in a book. Took me forever to find it. (leaves crackle) Used to be huge, then they developed the property and this is all that's left. There's nothing else like it from the period, which from the materials used and some of the building techniques, I think it's probably about 30 years old. Sam, when I work, my feelings come first. From them come design and theory. For me, this place has a solid feeling. Design and theory are definitely here, but I bet they came last. - Actually, it's 32 years. - Hm? - It was a competition to design a park for an urban lot. (Sam chuckles) I was 20, I was a lot more interested in the cash prize than in expressing my feelings, but I'm glad you like it. - Get out of here. This is your treasure? - Swear to God. It's too bad they kinda let it go. (gentle music) You really live in a tent? - I used to. (Sam chuckles) (bright piano music) (thoughtful music) (hurried footsteps) (gate creaks) - Sam? Sam! Sam, you're late! (heels clicking) - Ah, yeah, okay. - Are you all right? - Yeah, I'm fine, yeah. - (sighs) Just do me a favor. It took me a long time to get used to living with the most punctual man on Earth. Don't change on me now. Mother's making you breakfast. Come on, hurry up, it's gonna get cold! Come on. (pats) - Okay, okay, okay! (weatherman chatters) (sighs) (TV zaps) - Where's Zoey? - I don't know, why? (scoffs) She said she was stuck. You know, everybody is a little off this morning. - I hope I'm not included in that review. - If you don't overcook Sam's eggs. He is late, ooh, is he cranky. - Could be male menopause. - Excuse me. - Mm! I saw it on "Oprah," this man was in terrible shape. - Mother, Sam does not have male menopause. - Who's got menopause? - Nobody has menopause, eat, eat, eat! - Good morning, everybody. - Ah, my Lord. - Oh, you do lay the best eggs, Janet, but I don't have time. - Oh, Sam. - Coffee, that's what I need. Waggin', Zo-Zo. - You know, it would be different if you weren't my father. - What would it be different? - Being late. I mean, it's not a crime, Zoey, it's just-- - Zo, Zo, move your ass. Bye everybody, see ya later. - Hey, hey, hey, what about my goodbye kiss? - [Janet] It's important for families to eat together. It helps children bond to their parents. - [Elisa] Bye! - (sighs) Fine. (phone rings) (employees chatter) - Oh, here he comes now, just a moment. Sam, there's a Mr. Bentley who would like to speak with you. - Boy, you certainly have a lot of awards. - It's not my idea. (mutters) My, my wife decorated my office and uh, what can I say, she's proud of me. (intercom beeps) - [Phyllis] Sam, a contractor, Mr. Bentley is here. He says he won't leave until he can speak to you. - (sighs) Just tell him I'm not here. Uh, look... Look, I think that we uh-- (knocking) (sighs) - He saw you come in. Also there's a presentation in the board room in 20 minutes. - If that's Nick Bentley, just tell him I'm the other architect on the project. I think he'll go quietly. (phone rings) - And close the door, Phyllis. - He botched up a job of mine. I almost had to get his license revoked. So you better stay on my good side. (Sam chuckles) - I'm a happily married man, that's why I stopped. I've never met anybody like you. Obviously, I find you (sighs) very attractive and very smart and, if things were different-- - I was married once for a couple of minutes. He was a poet. He wrote about our marriage instead of participating in it. Being the only child of two dead parents, I sort of thought having a husband might be good company, but I was wrong. Anyway, I'm glad you stopped. It's not my style. I almost never sleep-- - (knocking) Hi! - With interns' fathers. - If I forgot anything, I'm gonna kill myself. (sighs) Hi, Nell. - Hi. - Nice shoes! Like 'em, Dad? - Yeah, yeah, I liked 'em when I wore 'em in the service too. (laughs) - I wear 'em 'cause I like 'em. - Good. - Listen, uh, I have work to do, so if you... (phone rings) - Bye. - [Sam] Bye! - [Zoey] Dad said you grew up in Europe. - [Nell] Yeah, have you been? - [Zoey] No, not yet. - Oh, at your age, you should go. (phone rings) (employees chatter) (door creaks) - [Zoey] Who died? - Huh, what do you mean? - Well, it looks like a funeral inside. - [Elisa] Oh no, your father brought me flowers. - Yeah, it's an old fashioned custom between men and women, Zo, you wouldn't know anything about it. It's before Zack's time. - How come you got flowers if you're going out of town? Oh Mom, Nell Bergen was wearing these shoes that Dad could not handle. - That bad? - Well, it went with the rest of her outfit, I guess. - [Elisa] Huh? - Right, was he always this conservative? - Oh, no. - No, as a matter of fact, he wasn't. (Elisa chuckles) - I'm starving, what's for dinner? - Whatever Dad wants. - Whatever Dad wants! (door creaks) (jazzy piano music) - [Employee] Good morning, Mr. Mercer. - (clears throat) Hey! - How was your vacation? - Uh, it was great. (stammers) I was gone. - Are you all right, Sam? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm fine. Listen, do you think-- David, how ya doin', hey, you look great. - Thanks. - You know, I wanted to ask you, (stammers) that earring that you wear in your nose, does that thing hurt? - It's a nose ring, I can't feel it. - Oh, well that's good, that's good, that's good. What I mean, that's good that can't, can't feel it. (stammers) I'll talk to you later. (jazzy piano music) (phone rings) - I thought you had a policy about never mixing work and pleasure. - I do. - Oh, so what's that smell? - That what? - Smell, as in scent? Like when animals have the hots for each other and they release an odor? - David, (laughs) has anyone ever told you, you are a bizarre human being? - My parents, well all my relatives, actually. Let's see, the United States military and I think you've mentioned it before. - No doubt, I'm going to have coffee. - I'd love to join ya. - Okay. (Nell sighs) So we got carried away for a moment. Nothing of any real consequence and it's over. - And? - And he's happily married and I'm happily divorced and anyway, I must have a bug or something. I don't feel up to another (speaks foreign language). - You sure? - I'm actually tired. - Maybe you're at that age where you need to start taking iron. - Thank you, David! (chuckles) - You know, repression can be exhausting. You may have doused the flame, but the fire isn't out. (clicks tongue) (papers rustle) - I don't know why I let you talk me into these. You shouldn't have pressured me. I just hate it when you do that. Now I'm going to have to return these before the sale's over. - You're crazy, they're great! - Yeah, well maybe, but Sam won't like 'em. - Sam isn't going to wear them. - I'm taking them back. - Well, I'm not taking this back. - (gasps) Well, Murray will certainly appreciate that. - He might, but I know someone else who definitely will. - Who? Bess, who are you talking about? (phone rings) (heels click) Bess! (car rumbles) (laughing) (talking over each other) (men chatting distantly) (car doors slam) (men laughing and chatting) (ominous music) (suspenseful music) (men laughing) (elevator dings) (men chatting) (suspenseful music) - Yeah, well somebody better check it out before somebody gets hurt! (slams phone) (elevator dings) - Sam! Got some bonafide neighborhood guys to help us with our plans. This is Sam, he's the big cheese around here and he is very, very serious. To the left. (Sam sighs) - Ay yo, Sam. Chill, man. - Chill means relax. (phone rings) - [Employee] Did you schedule that appointment? (Sam sighs) - Hi, Dad. - Hey, pumpkin, how 'bout some popcorn? - Oh, it'll probably give me food poisoning. - What are you talking about, my popcorn? - Oh, don't take it personally. It's just the kinda day I had. First I broke the coffee machine. - You what? - The one at work. (chuckles) Then, I picked up the wrong plans for the fountain project. Now they can't get the right ones until Monday. And after I got yelled at for that, Nell canceled lunch. - Who did? - She was gonna turn me on to this great soul food restaurant near the community center. But she went to the doctor instead. - Huh. - David said it's a miracle she went at all because she really is the opposite of a hypochondriac, whatever that is. - Christian scientist. (Zoey chuckles) - You wanna go with us? - What, to the doctor? - No, to the soul food restaurant. - Yeah, yeah, sounds like fun. - You're a good guy, Dad. Mwah! (heels click) - (sighs) Yeah. (thoughtful music) (shower splashes) (buttons beep) (phone rings) - [Nell Recording] Hello, you've reached the residence of Princess Di. Please leave your message after the tone. Oh, and if this is Charles, don't bother to call back. (door clicks) (phone clatters) (melancholy music) (kisses) (Elisa humming) (tense piano music) - David, morning. - Morning, Sam. (clears throat) Where is she? - She's in jail. She got a speeding ticket, apparently told the officer he has an authority problem. (chuckles) Anyway, they arrested her but she wouldn't let me pay bail. She wants to experience being a prisoner as a sociological event. - (stammers) She wants what? - Well, she's been incarcerated before. Jaywalking conflict, picketing an animal research lab. Of course, she'd say we're all in some type of prison anyway. She once told me men in jail are more honest. (David chuckles) - (sighs) All right, look, I need the tower plans. - Nell's got 'em. She was gonna get copies today. (Sam groans) - I do appreciate your generosity, but I simply told David I did not want to be bailed out! - Believe me, the last thing I wanted to do was to bail you out, okay? But the tower plans happened to be locked in your car, which they won't open unless you are there. (siren wails) - Okay, fine. They can open the car, you can have your plans, I'm going for a burger. - Yeah, well you're gonna have to walk. - Why would I walk? - Why would a woman with your brains and your looks wanna spend the night in a holding cell? - You wouldn't understand even if I told you! - The reason you're gonna have to walk is because you have so many unpaid tickets, they impounded your car! - Where's your car? - It's right over there, we just walked past it. - Can I have a lift? - Absolutely! (upbeat percussive music) - Did I tell you I thought about you in the slammer? - Yes, several times, but why don't you tell me again? (upbeat percussive music) (chuckling) (Zoey sighs) - Look, it's not like I'm (stammers) joining a cult or getting tattooed, I-- - I'd rather you get tattooed. - Lots of people go back to school and graduate, and pursue careers! - But honey, you have two years to go. (Zoey sighs) I mean, doesn't Zack want you to graduate? He did! - Yeah, and he still doesn't know what he wants to do! - Oh, please. - Look, Dad, if you wanna fire me or have me move out, that's fine. But I am taking another semester off. I'm going to Europe with Zack and I will finish school when I come home. (clattering) I will be at Zack's. (heels click) (door slams) - I'll get you some more coffee. - No, don't! (clatters) All right, please. (stammers) Don't wait on me, Elisa, okay?! - I am not waiting on you. - (grumbles) I'd just like to push a button and fast forward our lives. - And what would you fast forward to? (birds chirping) Hm? I don't know, old age? Together. - Mm. - You know, Zoey visiting with the kids, and her husband. - Mm, who probably will not be Zack. Then again, she could do worse than Zack. You remember that guy when she was a freshman? - Elisa, I'm having an affair. (sighs and stammers) The first time it ever happened-- - You're what? - I'm sorry. - [Elisa] Sam. - I'm sorry, (stammers) I had to tell you. I wanna talk about it. (clattering) (clanging) We have to talk about it. - Doctor's office. (employees chatter) - Didn't expect to see you back so soon. Believe me, it wasn't my idea. Do you think anybody still eats creamed tuna on toast? - Uh-huh, my mother. - Well, my mother drank. And she cautioned me about doctors. She said they only practice medicine-- - 'Cause they can never get it right. Hold this. - Okay. He'll be in to see you in just a few minutes. - What do you wanna bet he blames it on the lab? (phone rings) - Hello? - Great, I will tell him. (traffic rumbles) (heels click) - Elisa? I waited for you for an hour, we lost our start time. Hello, anybody home? Elisa? What's going on? - Why are you having an affair, Bess? - Why what? - Why are you putting your marriage in jeopardy? Why are you sneaking and lying? - I don't know. Murray doesn't have much of a sexual appetite. It's my last chance. - I have to go. (car rumbles) (employees chatter) (knocking) - Nell. - Sam, I need to finish. - I told Elisa. - You what? - (stammers) I don't know for sure what's happening with us but I know I don't want it to stop and I, I don't wanna lie to anyone about it. - I don't believe this is happening. - (laughs) I know how you feel. (kisses) (phone rings) Sweetie. - Um, Sam, there's something I need to tell you. - (exhales sharply) I don't care. All right, (chuckles) I've thought about this. Whatever it is, I don't care. If you're married, you used to be a nun, you've had a sex change operation, don't tell me because I don't care. - Sam, I'm sick. - (scoffs and stammers) Why, what do you mean? Because you're sleeping with a married man? Come on, you're supposed to be the progressive one in this-- - Sam. - What, sweetie, what? (knocking) Sweetie, what is it? - Excuse me, Sam. Mrs. Merser's on the phone. - I'll call her back! (somber music) (employees chatter) - I went to the doctor and... - What, what is it? (speaking distantly) (music swells) (water bubbles) (door thuds) Elisa! - No, Dad, it's me. What's up? - Hi, I was looking for your mom. - Oh, well didn't she tell you? Bess had some sort of a panic attack or something and Mom went to stay with her for a couple of days. - Ah, I guess we must've just missed each other. - Yeah, well if you ask me, it's the moon. I mean, it's almost full, you know? Which is always when people get really weird. And did you see Nell today? She was out there. - Yeah, well she was, (clears throat) she's, she's gone to the mountains. - See, people get weird! I'm gonna defrost a pizza, you want some? - No, no, I'm not hungry. Look, Bess. Bess, please, (stammers) just tell Elisa, I just wanna talk to her, just for a minute. I wanna see how she is. (sighs) All right, okay. Tell her I said goodnight. (phone clatters) (melancholy music) - Sam, we know these things can happen, you know, we're both adults. (sighs) But I know us, I know, I know that we can work it out. - I know you've given this a lot of thought. - No, Sam, every thought! Each and every thought since you first told me. Now, what we gotta do is look at our options. - She's dying. (melancholy music) - She's what? - She's got some form of leukemia. She's got about three or four months to live and I, (exhales) and I need to be with her. (exhales) (melancholy music) - Do you love her, Sam, or you just feel sorry for her? (Sam grunts) - Listen, Elisa, (grunts) I don't know if, if you could forgive me, but-- (sighs) But when she, when (clears throat) this is over... I'd love to come back. I love you, I love our life together. You're my family. (sobbing softly) - You're my family, Sam. You're my family. (thoughtful music) (doorbell rings) (knocking) (clock ticks) (sobbing softly) (doorbell rings) (lock clicks) - Elisa! Oh my God, Elisa! (sighs) I was ringing the bell. - Well, I had the radio on. I just, I just turned it off. - Honey, are you all right? - Yeah, I'm fine. - Hey, Mom? Do you think, um, Dad would let me and Zack borrow the video camera? - You really have a lot of nerve, (breathes heavily) announcing your asinine plan to go off to Europe, and then you go running off to Zack's! And what is it that you want? Just whatever you want (snaps) and whenever you want it?! (snaps) - Mom, I'm sorry. I didn't realize it was such a big deal. - Well, it is a big deal, Zoey, because I can't figure out what your father wants or doesn't want, because he's not living with us anymore. (Elisa sighs) He's having an affair with a woman who's dying. (Elisa laughs bitterly) - Sweetheart-- - Yeah, Mother, what, what? I mean, was there a talk show about men who leave their wives for terminally mistresses? (laughs and sighs heavily) Oh, God. I mean, (stammers) what do the women do? You tell me, what do the women do? Do you think that they, they beg their husbands not to leave them for someone who's dying? Or do you think that they let them go, and then take them back when the other woman has kicked the bucket? (sobs) Oh, you haven't seen that show yet, have you? (sobs) (hurried footsteps) (knocking) (sighs) - Nell, it's Sam. Come on, open up. (knocks) (lock clicks) Hi, I brought you some flowers. Look, I found this hanging off the door. The city is gonna turn your power off tomorrow. So, how were the mountains? - Good, good air. - Can I come in? - Sam, I'm sorry, I'm afraid I made a mistake. I don't want you to destroy your family. And I don't want what's left of my life to become a maudlin circus for two. - Now, it's not gonna happen, all right? (stammers) It's too late, anyway. I already told Elisa, I packed my bags, they're in the car, I mean where-- - My main concern right now is that tomorrow, they're coming to turn my power off and I have a refrigerator packed with food. I'm sorry, I have things to take care of. (door thuds) (thoughtful acoustic music) (fridge whirs) (juice splashes) (Nell sobs) (alarm buzzes) (wistful music) (Nell knocks) (Sam groans) You're gonna get a ticket. - Nell, just... Just tell me that you're not in love with me. - I'm not in love with you. - I don't believe that. - I am in love with you, but I have no respect for a man who flagrantly disregards city ordinances. (Sam chuckles) - Hey, hey, hey, wait a minute. Hold on a second. These are for you; unfortunately they're-- - They're dead. Okay, Sam, these are the rules. We have to say it, whether it's dear departed, gone but not forgotten, passed away. (inhales) Or dead. You have to say it, Sam, hm? (kisses) (wistful music) - He left a number where we can reach him if we need him. - How responsible. - Oh come on, Bess, what's he supposed to do? Not leave a number? - No, what he's supposed to do is not leave you. - Oh, really? So according to your rules, it's okay to cheat. You just have to stay home to do it. I thought we were etched in stone. - So did I. - So, the west wing is our biggest problem. - No, I think it's, I think it's the position of the west wing that's preventing us from getting the flow we need from inside to outside recreation. What about the north end? - Hi! Sorry I'm late. Zack and I had an urge to go to brunch, so we did. Uh, is there anything I can do for your, Dad? I mean, any, any whim you need satisfied, or have they all been taken care of? (phone rings) - Would you excuse us? (door thuds) Would you please like to tell me what the hell that was all about? - Oh golly, Dad, I wonder. Could it be that my skirt wasn't ready at the cleaners, or that you walked out on Mom and me for some bimbo?! - Nell is not a bimbo. - Nell? - Nell is dying. - Does Mom know, who? (employees chatter) - Congratulations, really nice job. - Thanks. - No, no, I haven't told her yet. Let's go over here and talk, okay? Look, Zo, I didn't plan this, all right? Any more than Nell planned to get sick. I love you, (stammers) I love your mother. I'm asking myself questions I don't have answers-- - So why does she wanna be with you? - (scoffs) Listen, Zo. We wanna be with each other, for whatever time we have left. I know this is an awful lot to try to understand but believe me. (stammers) I'm really trying to do what I think is right. - Good, so am I. Zack and I are getting married. Oh, don't bother checking the mail for your invitation. (Sam sighs) No, I don't get it. I mean, if Dad doesn't give a damn about you then why should you give him the benefit of the doubt? - Honey, he does give a damn about me. He's been my husband for over half my lifetime. And in case you have forgotten, he is the father of my only child. Honey, your father and I have always shared everything. Sometimes, I don't know where I stop and he begins. (sighs) Zoey, have you ever given anybody the benefit of a doubt? - Yes, but I am not a doormat. (phone rings) - Would you please get that? - I'd rather not. (heels click) - Hello? Oh no, when? All right, (stammers) I'll be right there. (phone slams) Oh God, that was Dr. Shore from the hospital. Grandma's been taken there with chest pains! I, I've gotta get my stuff. Will you please call your father, Zoey? Honey, I understand how hard this is but listen, we're both going through it. (sighs) I'm trying to do the best I can, I need you to help me. Please, will you help me, please? Come on. Hi Murray, it's Elisa, is Bess there? (intercom chatters) She... Oh no, no, well she was with me, yeah. Um, oh gee, Mur, I don't have a watch, I don't know when. Well she'll be there soon, I'm sure. I mean, (stammers) she should be there any minute, yeah. Listen, Sam's here, I've gotta go. I'll uh, I'll call her, I'll call her later, huh? Just tell her I can't go to work tomorrow. I'll, I'll explain later. - So, how's Janet? - (sighs) In and out of consciousness, with a lot of tubes and... (Sam sighs) She called your name a couple of times. - (sighs) How you doin'? - I've been better. (Elisa sighs) So, Bess told Murray that she was out with me tonight. - Hm, was she? (sighs tensely) - No. But I have a good idea of where she was. - It's Nell Bergen. It's the architect that I'm working with. (employees chatter) - Well, I didn't think it was Phyllis. (sighs) You're living in a tent? - Ah. No, she has a place downtown, I'm staying there. Hi, Zo. - Hi. - Hi, honey. - (clears throat) So, how's Zack? - Fine. Um, Mom, I'm gonna go back in and sit with Gran. - Okay, sweetheart. I'm gonna visit with your, with your father for a while. (siren wails) (intercom chatters) - Want some more coffee? - Yeah. Maybe after a while, people just have to switch roles. (sighs) After being taken care of for so long, maybe you need to take care of somebody. (thoughtful music) (door slams) - David! I don't suppose that coffee's for me, huh? - 'Fraid not, Nell was too tired to sleep. She called a little before three and said she thought it would be a good idea if she worked, but she didn't wanna work alone. - Yeah, you're a good friend, David. - It's easy, I love her. - Yeah, me too. - David, these plans stink! Please don't hurry just because I am sick. How's the mother-in-law? - Ah, she's out of the woods, thanks. - Good. Well, at least she's not gonna croak. - Nell, you look... You look tired. - Is that compared to people in intensive care, or just dying people in general? - I just remembered something I forgot. - They say dying is easy, comedy's hard. Boy, are they wrong. Can't forget about it for one second! It's this horrible coincidental phenomena crap where everywhere you turn, there's a song on the radio. There's a report about death and dying on the six o'clock news. There are bookstores packed with books, just about dying! There are how-to books, because they figure no one, no one gets beyond the amateur standing. - (clears throat) Nell, why don't you just go home? - Because I don't want to go home! So I can have some soup and listen to a tape of whales giving birth. Oh, that would really make me feel better! Sam, why don't you leave me alone? - Is this about me seeing Elisa last night? - Oh please, Sam! This is about work. I'm behind, and we both know what that means. That there's not much chance of me bringing this project to life. (pants) But I wanna have a shot at it. So if you'd just let me work. Please let me work. (thoughtful music) - [Janet] What'd I miss? (sighs happily) - About 18 hours and a mild heart attack, but you're gonna be all right. No surgery, just a change in your lifestyle. - No more chocolate-chocolate chip? - (chuckles) Not after every meal. - Heard from Sam? (intercom chatters) - He left a few hours ago. He was here most of the night. (sighs) He's not having an easy time. - Neither did your father. - Pardon me? - Oh, your father loved me, in a manner of speaking. And he most certainly loved you. But he also loved a lady named Claire, with whom he had a somewhat tortured relationship just under 20 years. - What! - Claire was married to a prominent judge, so she didn't feel she could get a divorce, and I guess your father didn't want one. - But you and Dad were always-- - (groans) Relationships are, are just an idea, Elisa. Ideas are a function of our imagination. You imagined your parents had a good marriage and in many ways, we did. - How can you say that if-- - Oh, I, I had the opportunity to travel by myself, which as you know, I adore. And I, I had relationships... with other people, which I enjoyed as well. (Elisa sighs) (thoughtful music) (papers rustling) I can't find the Borowski file! Do you have it, Bess? - Aha, so there is a correlation between sex and organization. (phone rings) Sorry. You're gonna get an ulcer, you know? Or maybe you'll just go crazy and kill someone? (drawer slams) - Maybe I'll kill you. - Well, at least then you'll be doing something. - I am doing something, Bess. - Oh really, what? what are you doing? You're looking for a file, you're getting a manicure. You're living like your life is normal. Like nothing's changed. - Fine, Bess, fine! I know I should do something, I just don't know what! I played by the rules, we were good! We communicated, we fought, we played, we had a child. I enjoyed buying shoes, clothes, things Sam liked. (sighs) There oughta be instructions for this because I don't know what to do. - Well, maybe that's because you don't know whether you miss Sam or the life you had with him. Well, there's a difference, you know? - Stop it, Bess! Do you know what I'm doing? I'm waking up every morning and I am struggling to get out of bed. I'm forcing myself to eat a piece of toast which nearly gags me, and then I'm running five miles instead of two and a half because I'm afraid if I don't-- - Elisa, I didn't mean to upset you like this. - Just do me a favor, will you? Stop with the ulcer advice and the dime store psychology. And don't you ever, ever use me to lie to Murray again! (sighs) (slams files) (phone rings) - Mercer Jacobs? (employees chatter) - Hi, Phyllis. - Oh, you can't-- - I know, he's at the dentist. - Phyllis, I'm going to leave-- (phone rings) - You're Nell. - Yes, I am. I didn't expect to see you. - No. No, please, don't go. Please, just close the door. (door thuds) - I did not ask Sam to be with me. - I asked him not to. - Yeah. - You know Zoey quit her job because she couldn't handle being here with you and her father? - I know. - I thought you'd be younger. (Nell chuckles) - It's a mess, but it's worse for you. Because when I'm gone... my feelings will be gone too. - Nell... I'm sorry. - Yeah, I'm sorry too. (phone rings) (employees chatter) I always preferred salad at the end of the meal. That's they way they do it in Europe. - What did you just say? - About salad? - Before that. - About changing my mind? Women's prerogative, Sam. - (stammers) Cut the crap, Nell. Come on, what, what are you trying to tell me? What are you saying? - Well, this afternoon I went to see the doctor. I thought I was ready to hear some of the less subtle symptoms of this disease. As you know, it can be sudden. It all sounds very grim. (sighs) - Look Nell, I told you that doesn't matter to me. - It matters to me. I think the longer we're together, the more difficult it's gonna be for you when I'm gone. - Hey, now, wait a minute. Wait, now that's a decision that I make, not you. - No, the dying person makes the decisions. (Sam sighs) Your bags are by the door, Sam. - Nell, why are you doing this? - When I'm with you, I remember I'm dying. I feel like I'm dying! (car alarm blares distantly) There's so much anger and pain. We started too late, Sam. What I have with you, I do not want to rush. Would you please leave? Please leave. (gasps softly) - Mom, stop if you want to. - I'll stop at the car. And then, I'm going for a spin. - Oh really, who's driving? - I've imposed on you long enough. And besides, two weeks at your house has given me a case of cabin fever. - Thank you, it's, (chuckles) it's been 10 days. - Hm. - Maybe you'd like to go live with Sam in his hotel room. - He's not with her anymore? - I'm not sure. He's not staying there, that's all I know. Well, here's good news! (brakes screech) Your granddaughter's survived another wilderness weekend with Zack. (laughing) - Uh-oh, looks like trouble in paradise. - Maybe it's catching. Honey, is something wrong? - No, Mom, everything's wrong. - Oh, boy. - Zack says he doesn't wanna have kids. He says they're um, little anchors and he wants to sail with the wind. - Oh, sweetie. - I'm gonna get some honey. Does anyone else want honey? - No. (sighs) Zack. - Mom? What happened to the kitchen? What'd you do? - I think your mother decided that she wanted-- - I'm making some changes. - Some changes? Dad built you that kitchen. You said that that was the perfect kitchen! - Dad built the kitchen he wanted. Now it's gonna be the kitchen I want. Okay? (scoffs) - I don't get anyone anymore. I mean, you, Zack, Nell, Dad. I hope you don't have any deep, dark secrets, Gran. I couldn't handle that. - Oh, boy. (slurps tea) (crowd talking over each other) - I don't see no music room. I heard there were gonna be lessons. - Yeah, you're gonna sign up right over there, behind the childcare, okay? - My momma wants me to play the horn. I wanna play the drums. - Why don't you play both? - Good morning, Sam. (crowd chatting) - Good kid. So, how's it going? - Good, yeah, people feel good. Everybody's helping out. - Well good, that's the whole idea. - Nell's been working too hard, though. - Yeah, I haven't seen too much of her the last couple of weeks. She's been working at home. - Now, what was it she said about you? - Oh, brother. (chuckles) - That you weren't a diamond in the rough, but you were the diamond. She said you'd been going through some tough times, that somebody close to you was very sick. I'm sorry. - This is ridiculous. I mean, this is ridiculous! If you want, I'll stay at the hotel. - No. - No to which part? - I guess you're um, you're lucky that I'm not strong enough to resist you. (thoughtful music) Tell me the truth. - 'Kay. - How do I look? - Loved. - Okay. - Okay, now, that back splash needs to be light. - [Elisa] Right. - The 20 years I've been contracting, people use this. Kinda reminds me of an Italian restaurant. (laughing) - Yeah. I really, I wanna stick with these, these are great. - Okay. - Don't you think? - Those are nice, yeah. - Mm-hmm. - You might wanna run it by your husband though, 'cause couples sometimes get into things over this stuff. (chuckles) - Mm-hmm, yeah, well I'm separated, so. - Oh. (door thuds) - Elisa! - Mom! Oh Mom, this is my contractor in here, Richard Pra, uh, (stammers) Prinder? - Pender. - Pender, Pender. My mother. - Nice to meet you. - Janet Catherine. - Nice to meet you. (laughs) - Why don't I run out and get those wood samples. - Great. - Well, it's nice to have an attractive man around the house. - I think they gave you too much oxygen at the hospital. - You do? I don't. (birds chirping) (papers rustling) (phone rings) - Anyway, the doctors say she'll have some good days but you know, the whole thing can change overnight. From now on, it's all a matter of how she feels from day to day. - When I ask her how she feels, she just says fine. She used to tell me the truth, now she just says "fine." - Yeah. (Zoey knocking) Hey! - Hi, can I talk to you for a minute? - Sure. Do me a favor, would you call Nell? Tell her I'll be a few minutes late and ask her if there's anything else she needs, all right? - You got it. - What I wanna know... is how come you still have Mom's picture on your desk? - Because she's my wife, and I, I love her. - Right, I... (inhales) I don't get it. - Oh (sighs) Zoey, I'm not sure I do either. Relationships are never airtight. They, they have, empty spaces. And when things are mostly good, well you, you just don't notice the spaces, but then something happens. And someone comes along and she fills up those spaces. (stammers) She makes you realize that they were there in the first place and how, how wonderful it feels not to have them empty anymore. (sighs) So what about your plans? - Oh, um... Well, (stammers) we postponed the wedding. Um, Zack and I are reviewing some things and besides, the original date didn't work with um, Mom's new job. - Your mom has a job? - Oh yeah, the one they always wanted her for at the museum. You should see what she's done to the kitchen. And the backyard. (bird caws) (dog barks) (Elisa gasps) - (sighs) You scared me! - I'm sorry. What are you doing, Elisa? - I'm having a new sprinkler system put in. - That's a good idea. - I'm glad you approve. - So, Zoey said that you'd taken a new job. - Yes, I did. - You know, you don't need to do that. Elisa? (door thuds) - You want some tea? - Yeah, herbal if you have it. Elisa, (scoffs) I thought you loved this kitchen. - Yeah, I thought so too, huh. You know, after we were married, I felt so fulfilled and happy, you know? And then we had Zoey, and I even felt more fulfilled, which I didn't think was possible. I didn't give a lot of thought to what else I wanted. Did you know my father had a mistress? - No. (Elisa scoffs) - You know, you really scared me out there. - I'm sorry, I didn't mean to. - I think I'd like your house key. (dog barks distantly) (kids screaming) (whimsical music) - Sweetie, it's an awful night. Why don't we just go home? - (sighs) No, Sam, I love the rain. You think people can tell? - About your being sick? - No, about how much I love you. - Would you mind if I asked you a very personal question? - Sure. - Would you marry me? (thoughtful piano music) Hm? - If I live long enough to write my memoirs... this night will definitely be in there. A man proposed. I said, "No." That I needed to throw up. I saw a restroom somewhere up here. - Come on, come on. (thoughtful music) - Maybe we should tell the doctor about our sex therapy. 'Course, he might think that you were a pervert. - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, I love you too. - And he couldn't possibly imagine so much pleasure. (rain patters) - Woo! I'm back. (door slams) It's showtime, comedy night! I got "Spaceballs," I got "Naked Gun." I got "The Twelve Chairs," I betcha there's-- - Sam. The doctor's on his way. (bag thuds) - I was gone for an hour. (Nell groans weakly) (Sam murmurs) - Thank God. - Listen to me. See, see, the only problem at the carnival was that I wasn't prepared. - Prepared? - Yeah. (wistful music) Nell Bergen, would you do me the very great honor of... becoming my wife? (rain patters) (Nell breathes weakly) - Can I tell you a secret? - Sure. - When I was little... people asked me, what did I want to be? I said, "Engaged. Never married, just engaged." (Sam sniffs) (Sam chuckles) Sam, I don't know what it was between us. - Is, hon, what it is. (kisses) - Sometimes, people just fit. (melancholy music) Sam... I want you to let go of me. - Oh, no, no, no, no, no. (whispers) Just rest, the doctor's on his way. - I'm not engaged to the doctor. I need you to let go. - [Sam] No, no, not yet, no. Not yet, please, not yet. I, I, I want, I want more, Nell. Nell, please, please. (Nell breathes weakly) Nell, Nell? Nell, come on, Nell, Nell. (music swells) (stammering) I need more, Nell. (sobs softly) (melancholy music) (phone rings) (Zoey knocking) - Yeah? - Got a minute? - Hey. (chuckles) For you, I got more than that. So, what's up? - I'm going to Europe. - (laughs) Didn't I know this already? - Not with Zack. - Oh. - With my friend, Lydia. - Ah. - The relationship thing is weird. - Tell me about it. - Um, Dad. - Yeah? - I wanted you to know... I would have invited you to the wedding if there had been one. I would have invited you and Nell. - Oh sweetie, thanks. (stammers) That means a lot to me. - I'm sorry. - [Sam] I know. - She was... - (chuckles) Yeah, yeah, she was. (thoughtful music) (dog barks distantly) (doorbell rings) - Hey, you're early! Come on in, make yourself a drink. - Mom! It's-- - Hi, sweetie. - Dad, hi. - [Sam] Hello. (Elisa sighs) - You were expecting Bill Clinton. - Uh, (chuckles) honey, would you excuse us? - Yeah. - Well, that's, that's quite an outfit. (stammers) You said to drop by-- - Tomorrow, I said tomorrow. - I think it's tonight. - A lot's been going on. I'm sorry, I'm busy, I just didn't... But I have a little time, you wanna talk in here? - [Sam] Bess and Murray comin' over? - Bess and Murray, you didn't know? They're separated. - Gee, I didn't know that. I'm sorry. (sighs) - Uh... Look Sam, you know, when we first talked about all of this, about your coming back, you know, when, when time passed, I thought it was fine. I really did, but then, now time has come and I, (chuckles) I don't think it's gonna work. - (scoffs) Well, (stammers) maybe it's just too soon. - No, it isn't too soon, Sam. (sighs) This is very hard, isn't it? - (sighs heavily) Well, it depends. - I've given this a lot of thought. We were like a piece of fabric, you know, we were woven together. We were perfect, and then this thing happened, you know? And you tore it apart. - Come on now, Elisa, look, we can, we can, (sighs) we can fix this thing. I'm not stupid, I know it's not gonna be easy. - Sometimes a tear is so bad, Sam, it can't be fixed. - Which means what? (sighs) - We've had a wonderful life. We've got a great daughter. But no matter how much I try, (scoffs) I'm sorry. It's over. I'm sure we could talk about this, but you know, it's getting late and I, I've got plans. It would be awkward if you were here. (door thuds) (calm music) - Excuse me, but what's the name of that, in the little dish? - [Sam] Uh, it's marinated spinach with bonito flake. It's very good, why don't you try it? Go ahead, please, you'll enjoy it. - (chuckles) Thank you. - Mm-hmm. (wistful music) (thoughtful acoustic music) (bright string music) (ambient music)
