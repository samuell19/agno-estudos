B.O.N F u n S u b s © ~ Band Of Nuts F u n S u b s presents {\a6}Episode 9 THE CITY HALL Shut up and listen to me! If you don't plan on changing, fine. I'll change. I'll change into someone you can never look down on. And for the things you did to me, I'll repay you accordingly. No, I'll give you back more. Okay, now I understand how you feel. How will you repay me? I will be Wonder Woman! I will be Inju City's Wonder Woman. I will run for Mayor in the upcoming election! You want to run for what? Run where? You're crazy for wanting to run! Do you think wearing star-studded shorts makes you a Wonder Woman? Do you think everyone with a mole on the nose is Jeon Ji-Hyun*? {\a6}[*famous Korean actress] {\a6}[*from the drama 'Temptation of Wife'] What about Min So-Hee*? She's totally crazy, just like you. No matter how tough the going gets, you don't have to be like this. Yes. Mock me and look down on me while you can. Talk as much as you want, because our social status will really change starting today. You're using quite a good ploy. How much do you want, the way you're acting like this? If you can't say it, text me. However, let me tell you. Being the cheerleader is just a one-off thing. Then how about you be my cheerleader! Although you won't be of much help. But if you can't say it, do you want to text me? But Joo-Hwa, I can see. You're afraid of me, aren't you? What I said about running scares you to death! You're funny! If it's funny, you should laugh. Why are you so nervous? That's why you should have held back your taunting. I'm leaving. Remember to throw this away when you leave. Hey! You come back! That stupid girl... You guys should have seen her face. Her eyes jumped out this far! In a fight, you have to throw the first punch. "Shut up and listen to me!" "If you don't plan on changing, fine. I'll change". My simple sentence is so good! It should have been this way long ago. You did great, Wonder Mi-Rae! So, are you really going to run for mayor? Are you crazy? I said it just to antagonize her. Why is everyone trying to take away my freedom and trying to turn me into an official? Don't you know I hate responsibilities? Even when playing cards, I'm never the dealer. Who in the world would vote for me if I ran? Me, my mom, you guys, Boo-Mi, Han-Ryang*, {\a6}[*Boo-Mi's husband] Min-Ji, Min-Jae, Min-Sung*. {\a6}[*Boo-Mi's kids] Oh, no! They're not old enough to vote. Look, there's no one. Then just wait for them to grow up. Three votes is significant. How about I start an affair? Then I can count as two votes. Unnie, why is she becoming more and more like you? Alba, although I can be over the top sometimes, I've always been modest and upright. The perfect role model. But you're a child who still reeks of your mother's milk. What? An affair? You're lucky I'm in a good mood today, or else I'll... That's right. Please don't try to have an affair. Please give that opportunity to Unnie. Even if Unnie is to have a baby now, people will think that it's her third. It's a model that is most highly recommendeded. Right, most highly... Do you all want a bloodshed tonight? My cellphone saved you. Boo-Mi. I was at the cafe. If I knew you were coming, I would have come back earlier, and made some food. Let's go in. Sit down first. I have something to say. Me too. Me too. I have a lot to tell you, too. But let's eat something first. If you don't want to eat, how about coffee? You're still talking about coffee... Aren't you annoyed? Why would I be annoyed? I kind of miss it. Anyway, I'm relieved, now that I can see you. I'm really thankful that you looked for me. No need to thank me. I came to collect the money that you owe me. - Give me the money. - Oh? Okay, okay! I just thought of looking for you again. Anyway, thank you. Wait a moment. I'll go to my room and get the money. Forget it. Just give me the money and documents tomorrow. Your proof of residency, personal seal, and tax returns. Be sure to bring everything with the money tomorrow. Documents? What are you going to do with them? Aren't you looking for a job? Bring everything tomorrow. I'm leaving. Don't follow me. Okay. Take care going home. This girl... she's looking for a job for me. Nice, Nice. Good shot! Whether it's work or golf, is there anything you can't do well? I initially thought you were giving Mayor Go a scare only. Who would have thought you annihilated him! Nice, nice! You're over-praising me. No need to be modest. You did a great job. There isn't much time left before the general election. Use this opportunity to choose the right candidate for the by-election and general election. Let's aim for a hole-in-one at the general election! I'll do my best. Don't over-burden yourself. How about working with our Chancellor Ahn Ji-Seong? He'll make a good impression, won't he? I heard the list of nominees will be posted tomorrow. Do your best and help him out. I've been looking forward to meeting you. This is the first time I'm taking part in an election. I'll be relying on you from now on. You won't be relying on me much. I request that you put me in charge of Inju City's mayoral election. You... what are you doing? Do you know how hard it was to convince the Chancellor? How dare you sprout nonsense! There's another candidate who's even harder to convince. I will produce Inju City's mayor. She should have completed her nomination registration by now. What in the world are you saying? You didn't even consult me. Who did you allow to register? A woman who doesn't know how many political parties there are in the Republic of Korea. You rascal! Are you joking with me? I'm not joking. Let me make another request. If the person I choose succeeds in becoming Inju City's Mayor, I request that you nominate me as the candidate for the General Election. What? Therefore, I suggest that you stop your business of selling nominations. You...You... How dare you? Why did you do that? What is your ultimate goal? Why nomination? I need to understand your plans, so that I can help you or stop you. Stop me? How are you going to stop me? Have you become more daring because I'm nice? I know I've lost credibility and your trust, but I'll still say what needs to be said. "A woman who doesn't know how many political parties exist in the Republic of Korea", could it be Shin Mi-Rae? - I'm surprised you're still concerned about her. - Hyung, are you crazy? You want to help Shin Mi-Rae become Mayor? Do you think this makes any sense? Did your back-stabbing me make any sense? If you're going to continue like this, why still keep me beside you? Just fire me. That way, both of us will have peace of mind. It's true that we both will have peace. But what right do I have to fire you? Didn't you see how I treated the Governor earlier? We're not that different. If the elder had coached me, I would have done the same thing you did. No, I would have done better than you because I'm one step ahead of you in the art of plotting betrayals. So don't turn your back to me again. Except when you're driving. Let's go. Wow! Our Al Pacino has grown so much! He can get married now! Does he have a girlfriend? Why? Are you dying of happiness being so lovey-dovey with your husband? Aren't you happier than me, Dad? Mom's lucky to have you. Even though she is an old lady, how can you still love her so much? Who knows? The older she gets, the more beautiful she becomes. Every strand of her white hair is beautiful. Even her plump tummy is beautiful. By the way, Dad, do you know Mr. Park Jun-Jin? Park... What about Park? What did he do? I'm not saying this because I'm your daughter. But honestly, what is so good about him? He can't compare to you in appearance, power or social status. Of course! There's no doubt about it! However, why did you bring this up? But, why did Mom like that man before? I heard he was Mom's first love. Every time I see Mom eating toast, she's sad and sentimental. Could it be that she isn't over him? It's annoying. I heard that man is going to stand for election. Election? The man who used to sell toast on the streets for a living is running for Mayor? That's what I'm saying. Mom was eating toast and she suddenly said, "Isn't a man's reputation the most important thing?" And she said it in a very sad voice, too. That woman is too much... So can't you also stand for election? Beat that man to the floor, and fully take over Mom's heart. Won't that be great? Daddy! You have so much money. What else is there to worry about? Daddy! The strawberries look great! First, we have to obtain certification for our products. There is a federal Department of Agriculture that inspects produce. If we obtain certification from them, it will help to promote our produce. I know the process very well, so I can help. They'll come for an inspection sometime, so keep a detailed journal of your work. What are you worried about? My nickname is "one stroke and it's done". {\a6}[*leading mid-Joseon period calligrapher] I am Han Seok-Bong* of Cheongkang village, don't you know? You should know my mother very well. You just focus on cutting the rice cake. I'll be responsible for eating them. Ah, drooling just at the sight of rice cake! No, not me, mother! My rice cake... Oh, Sun-Bo, you must be really busy with the upcoming election. What? Really? Yes. Really. I just came back from registering a nominee for the mayoral election. {\a6}[*10 million won = USD 8,000] Deposit was 10 million won*. I used five million from the money you gave, and five million from my own pocket. Why are you like this? Aren't you going too far with this joke? - Stop joking around. - I'm not joking. You have to stand for election. If you don't, we'll waste ten million won. Are you sick? Are you running a fever? I told you to stop joking! Do you think I'm bored with nothing to do? I thought getting 300 signatures was the most difficult requirement. But it ended up so easy. Once I mentioned your name, Kyung-Hee's mother, Shin-Shin dressmaker ahjumma, Yang Gong-Cha ahjussi, Gyeong-Bong's brother, Village Chief, Beonyoung grocery, Mi-Young's mom and the workers, me, my husband, my sister-in-law, Teacher Hang-Bo, her boyfriend, Go Yangi, Alba, Ji Woo-Gae, Ji Woo-Gae's team... Wait, wait, wait! Are you serious? You really went and registered? Do you swear on the lives of Min-Ji, Min-Jae, Min-Sung? Yes, I swear on the lives of my children. I'll buy you proper attire, if needed. You crazy brat! Are you insane? Have you gone mad? I'm not insane. They said no more than 500 signatures, so I stopped once I got 500. Don't you know how meticulous I am? You're crazy, crazy, crazy! You're really crazy! You're crazy, crazy, crazy! Really! What is this? What are you doing? Why is Mi-Rae standing for election? When you called, I put on my nicest clothes. It seems you didn't call me for a date. Stop fooling around and tell me what's going on! Is this your doing? You planned this all along, didn't you? Is it because this place is so small that news travels this fast? What exactly did you do? How could you register her candidacy without her knowledge? - I guess she should know by now. - What exactly is your motive? Why do you always use her kindness? How far are you going to take this? How far are you going to drag her? I'm asking you what it is that you want, you scumbag! Will you help if you know the reason? I really hope you can help me. Am I a joke? Am I not? Really? Would I ask for help from someone that I look down on? You're really... No matter how I look at it, people in this city are just weird. She's not even your wife. Even if she's your wife's friend, aren't you being overly concerned? Or do you think of Mi-Rae in a different way? What did you say? Hitting me once is enough. I didn't do anything to deserve a second punch. Let go. Still not letting go? {\a6]You can't come like the wind and leave like the morning dew without a trace. Of course. You can't come like the wind, and leave like the morning dew without a trace. That's why I did what I did. Hurry and answer. Jo Yong-Pil's throat is getting sore from singing too long. See you next time. Yes, Mi-Rae. Where are you now? I'll be there right away. Don't go anywhere. Just wait for me. How can that be? I already said I wanted to cancel my nomination. I want to cancel the registration! So you should return my money. It wasn't a few ten thousand, but ten million. Why can't you refund my deposit? What can I do? Look here. Is the election child's play? You registered without reading the information? Whether you pull out or not, the law states that the deposit is non-refundable! I know. But people make mistakes. My friend really made a mistake. I'm begging you. Just give me one chance and return my money. It wasn't easy getting this money. - This lady, really! - Mi-Rae! Bureau Director! What should I do? What about the ten million? They said I could cancel my nomination, but they couldn't return the deposit. What should I do now? Oh, you came at the perfect time. She understands everything, but is still acting this way. Driving me nuts, really! Is the nomination confirmed? - Is there any problem in the procedure? - None! Someone came in her place, and registered her with all the required documents. Everything was accepted and verified. What's the problem? I'm still figuring it out. Anyway, thank you for calling me. Get up. This is Deputy Mayor's doing. We'll make him take full responsibility. Deputy Mayor? No, it wasn't him. The person who registered me was Boo-Mi. Huh? Thank you for your help. Now that it has started, all that's left is my part. Did you get into a fight? Ah, I saw Bureau Director Lee a while ago. He heard Mi-Rae was registered as a candidate, and came to find me. Although I doubt he hits women, it'd be better to keep our meeting a secret from him. I was also worried about this problem. That's why I called you. I don't want any secrets between us, whether it's Mi-Rae or Director Lee. Why is this here? Haven't you paid the deposit? I have. I was worried I would not have enough money, so I accepted it. Thankfully, after asking around, I had enough. Then, just take this as a token of appreciation for your hard work. In that case, you should take this for your hard work. Deputy Mayor, do you honestly believe that Mi-Rae can be Mayor? Yes. But I don't. Mi-Rae is naive and is a scatterbrain. Do you realize she might disappoint many people? She runs around doing errands for people. Whether at the potato or cabbage fields, any place that's short-handed, she'll immediately go and help. She takes part-time jobs during weekends, and the money earned goes to a school fund. She makes kimbap when the children go on field trips. She buys a big bag of rice to make rice cake when there's a birthday. {\a6}Please make it extra tasty. Even though her words are rough, and everything she says sounds like a lie... {\a6}Yoo-Jin, happy birthday! I'll see you later at home! She is never fake, 365 days a year. She is always true and sincere. How can this kind and righteous person with no ambition become a mayor? I've never seen this kind of mayor. - So? - So that's why I'm putting all my money in. When it comes to money, Mi-Rae and I will do all we can. So please take this money for your hard work in making certain that Mi-Rae becomes Mayor. I would like to depend on her for the future. What are you going to do? What are you going to do now? We can't get the money back. No matter what, we don't have any money. Tell me what you're going to do! Why did you do it? You should at least have discussed it with me. I thought about it for a long time before I made the decision. You will vote for Mi-Rae, won't you? Vote for who? What's wrong with you? How could you just throw money away? How could you waste ten million just like that? This money isn't wasted. As long as you get more than 15% of the votes, the money will be fully refunded. - So you'll have to get more than 15% of the votes. - Is 15% that easy? Finding 15 people is already hard enough. How am I going to get over 15%? That's why I'm telling you to do your best and get more than 15%. Work your hardest and get that money back. And work your hardest to become Mayor. You have to become Mayor... so you can hire me again. I was once a great civil servant, making sacrifices and staying loyal to my country, doing all I could for the people, being creative and conscientious in my work, being respectful and credible at the workplace, living a righteous and clean life. I did my best to stay true to these principles. I faithfully did. Therefore, you have to give me back my job. Understand? Why are you like this? How can I become the mayor? How can a person like me become Mayor? Why can't you? Are you looking down on me? Are you looking down on Bureau Director Lee, on the ahjummas from the market? Are you looking down on everyone who signed the petition for you? So why did you have to drag them into this? How am I going to face everyone from now on? You're driving me crazy! By any chance, did you see Deputy Mayor about this? Yes. Actually, I got involved initially because of Deputy Mayor. But after I started collecting signatures, I realized that this was what I wanted to do from the start. - So... - I understand where you're coming from. But have you ever thought what's Deputy Mayor's purpose in doing this? Don't you know he actually wants a mayor whom he can easily manipulate? 15% of 130,000 = about 20,000? How many people can vote in Inju City? 100,000? 90,000? Did you hear? President Min of Inju Fibers was distributing lipstick at the women's market. {\a6}15% of 100,000 = 15,000? Guaranteed 500+ signatures You just found out? I received one with the prettiest color, too! Aigoo, but that's against the law! You can't just simply accept them. You could go to jail! {\a6}200 votes? 300 votes? 15,000 - 800 votes = 14,200 votes needed If we're arrested for receiving such small gifts, who's going to vote when the election comes? There was someone giving out rice the last election. But Mi-Rae, who are you going to vote for? What? I'll probably vote... for me. Hello! How are you? - Hello! - Mi-Rae! Isn't that the Deputy Mayor? It's been difficult lately, hasn't it? Stay strong! Hello there! Your business must be doing well. Oh, who is this? Aigoo, this hand is so diligent. If you stand for election, I will definitely vote for you! I still have many shortcomings. Long time no see. Yes. Who is she, Dad? I heard the child doesn't look like the Deputy Mayor at all. Could that be the reason they divorced? Oh, this Noona is... Dad's comrade. Hello. My name is Jo Rang. I know what comrade means. Between kids, it's called companion. Between adults, it's called comrade, isn't it? Wow, you're very smart, exactly like your dad. It's nice to meet you! Say hello. This is my mother. - Mother, this friend is... - I know. I've read the newspapers. Oh, it's nauseating! You know I hate the smell of seafood, yet you have to... Rang, let's go. - Have you been well? - Yes, somewhat. I'll see you again. Did he have to bow before leaving? As if we're complete strangers. He's the one who can't handle it... 15%. 15%. 15%. Dad, did I look good when I smiled? What do you mean? When I'm with Dad, I have to keep smiling. That's what Uncle Soo-In said. I have to smile happily. I have been... a horrible father to you. So you know? How can Rang and I continue to live like this? Did we have to come to this place and put on that kind of show? This is why I hate politicians. They force their entire family to become puppets in a show. Didn't you say you wanted to do some part-time work? I did. Why? Are you going to let me? - What do you want to do? - A bar. How about a flower shop? Why don't you just send Rang to become a monk and me a nun? Isn't that better? If you want to be noble, be noble yourself. I don't want to! You said you'd help me if I stood for election, didn't you? Yes. You also said you'd make me Mayor, didn't you? Yes. Do you really have a plan? Yes. If I don't become Mayor, can you guarantee I'll be able to get more than 15% of the votes? Yes. But if I don't get 15% of the votes, and don't become Mayor, can you return my deposit money? That's impossible. Mi-Rae won't fail. Is this for real? Are you serious? Can you swear by heaven and earth? If everything I say comes true, what will you give me? - What? - Will you do anything I ask? Yes. Aren't you even asking what it is? I know what it is. You do? It's what every man wants me to do, once they get close to me. - Really? - Yes. "Get away from me!" "Find a better man. I don't deserve you." "Let's just stay as brother and sister. Isn't it better?" What scumbags said this to you? Give me their numbers. There's one more scumbag. He's the worst of them all. How can there be so many? "This Noona is... Dad's comrade." Look. I'm not a 20-something girl, who hopes there's more to a one-night trip. I'm also not naive enough to fall head-over-heels over your every word. So you don't have to look so serious, nor care about these things... Lately, I've been doing things which I never did before. I've never been like this in my whole life. Doing those things took a lot of courage. Couldn't you see that? I admit I'm a bad person, but... I hope you won't see me as a despicable person. {\a6}If I have you by my side, {\a6}if I think about you, {\a6}if I love you, {\a6}you seem like a person that won't stay long. {\a6}If I let you go, {\a6}if I leave you, {\a6}you seem like a person that will love me more. {\a6}Anxious love. {\a6}Even so, I like this love. How can this be? Shin Mi-Rae is actually standing for election? She was able to register? Are we electing a leader for Inju Elementary School? Do you all want Inju City to be the laughing stock of the whole country? Why isn't anyone saying anything? We have to think of a plan to salvage the situation. Who is it? Who is closest to her? Chief Park was her superior. You must be closest to her. Yes, I was her superior. But we didn't have any relationship outside of work. So in regards to this, I'm also confused. Me? Of course I want to stop her. But Shin Mi-Rae really hates me. Ah, Bureau Director Byun especially liked Shin Mi-Rae's coffee. And often drank her coffee. Often? Me? I'm allergic to coffee, so I couldn’t drink any of it. Weren't you thinking of Bureau Director Ji instead? You even helped protect her from the eggs, didn't you? Yes. Actually for quite sometime... The person who developed a close relationship with Shin Mi-Rae is Bureau Director Moon here. I can't say that I knew her well. Yes. I will go and talk to her. Who are we? We are the Three Musketeers of Inju City Hall. We'll try our best to convince her to pull out of the election. Athos, Aramis, let's go! What were you thinking? You should have thought of a way to avoid this. Why did you have to take on this task? That's what I'm saying. How are we going to convince Shin Mi-Rae? I'm still hung over. When did we ever do things by ourselves? I have a plan, so don't get angry. Sober up first. Darling, help me sober up. Coming, coming! Haven't you guys drunk so much that alcohol is your enemy now? It's because alcohol is our enemy, that we have to finish it all up. Sister-in-law, thank you. Hamburgers and coffee are best for hangovers. Oh, Hyungnim! I told you we have a solution. Oh, our solution, have a seat! Why are you guys so happy to see me? Did something happen? Why don't you agree? How come you don't want to do it? Do you know how long we were scolded this morning? It's not even our fault. Why does she have to be like this? Because of her, City Hall's never going to have peace! Yes, Hyungnim. Help us to convince her. She'll listen to you. Yes. Taking part in the election has no benefits. You lose money, lose face, and hurt yourself. And she's not a Ten Pro*. {\a6}[*Adult TV show] Don't delay it anymore. Tell her to pull out now. I'm already this old. Don't tell me to serve a mayor who used to make coffee. Am I going to have to make coffee for Shin Mi-Rae? Hey, Ji Bang-Se is still in touch with politics! If you are thinking of making her coffee, you must believe she has a chance. I agree with you. However, Mi-Rae likes yogurt more than coffee. The large pack! Write it down. Hey, where are you going? Do you want to go against me? He doesn't have something with Shin Mi-Rae, does he? - Really? - Is that true? Protect and refine political culture. Promote and spread democracy. Candidate Registration Form Thank you, everyone. Thank you. Thank you. Omo, there's only five seconds to the deadline. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Can the list of nominations be revealed? What are the nominees' main agenda? Yes, the list of nominations... "Economy is in my hands". This is Candidate No. 1, Min Yoo-Kam. Everyone, please care for our revamped Winners Party. "Absolutely faithful to Democracy". I am Candidate No. 2, Purification Party's Ahn Ji-Seong. I must say.... "Practicing Politics and Defending Sovereignty". I am Candidate No. 3, Sovereignty Party's Kim Shil-Cheon. The first line of the Republic of Korea's constitution states... Hey, hey, hey! If you're done, it's my turn. "Developing Inju City", Candidate No. 4, Progressive Party's Park Jun-Jin. Number 4, number 4, number 4! Mr. Reporter, how is your father? Your father and I are pretty close. Oh my, he thinks human relationships are better than gold. So old-fashioned. Since there are only four nominees this time, the election should be quite simple, right? No. There's a fifth candidate with no political party. But it seems they haven't come today. It's Ms. Shin Mi-Rae. Who? Shin Mi-Rae? I can't watch ten million won go to waste. Right now, there's no other way. As long as I get more than 15% of the votes, I can get my money back. Do you think it's easy to get 15%? Do you know how many people makes up 15%? Do you have money? An election is won with money. Did it ever cross your mind that you'd have to spend more, to get back the ten million? That's why I'm preparing to have a clean race without spending such money. What's the point if you're the only clean one? How can you stay clean to defeat the other candidates who use lots of tricks? Do you think an election is an athletic competition, where you'll win if you just try your hardest? There are rules and referees. That's why you can't win merely by trying. Are you naive or stupid? Take 100 steps back and think, what skills do you possess? Did you graduate from a famous school? Have any outstanding skill or experience? You have no money, only a mediocre education, and laughable experience. Do you have anything that will attract people to vote for you? Who will vote for an inexperienced, young 10th grade civil servant? I don't care what other people think, but I didn't think you'd be like them. Those are biased views. It's because of such views that people get intimidated. Whether I'm 10th grade or 3rd grade is not important. A true civil servant is one who serves the people, not the country. That's what you once said. Was Mayor Go's education bad? Did he not have a brilliant background? Politics! What is it anyway? It is to help those who suffer to get a better life, and to encourage those who are well-off, to give away some. It'll be fine just doing these two things. At least I am confident that I can be a better mayor than Mayor Go. Why are you smiling? I knew you were going to say this. Didn't I tell you before? A person like Mi-Rae should be in politics. I was worried that you had run purely for the money. I was... well... Now that I know your true intentions, I will support and cheer you on. From now on, you will face many difficulties. Yes. First off, I can depend on my health. Are you confident you'll be able to endure it to the end? Do you have confidence that you won't be a runaway soldier? Aren't you going to help me? Shouldn't you have consulted me on the election staff, Candidate Ms. Shin Mi-Rae? I should have said those words instead. This old friend is the essence of Purification Party. This person cannot help someone who has no political party. Whose wife is a Councilor in the Winners Party? - Purification Party's spy! - Winners Party's agent! - What is your real objective? - Are you eating well daily? Stop! Stop! Why fight amongst ourselves? If you want to fight, fight with our enemies outside. When will we print the posters, and where will our campaign headquarters be? The campaign headquarters has been prepared. It's on the fifth floor of the new building next to the post office. You know I have a building, right? The third floor is currently vacant. The place I found has elevators from where you can watch movies. You know that my building was remodeled last month, don't you? People even stop by to take pictures. Wow... both of you are amazing! It must be difficult acting so childishly in front of me. The campaign headquarters will be here. What's the concept for our posters? Inju City By-election Poster Concept The key concept should be on how different she is from the male candidates. - A woman's enemy is another woman. - But that doesn't mean she should fight them. She should be intelligent, but still maintain her femininity. "I'm an Alpha girl!" We have to attract both male and female voters. A "perfect woman" image is poison. "Dignified and wealthy" - the most fitting image. A "perfect woman" image is poison. But it need not be an Achilles' heel. Women will envy her, but will also aspire to be like her. Women are like that. Otherwise, why would Michelle Obama's evening gown sell like hot cakes? Just focusing on the female vote will not win the election. Of course not! But the middle-aged voting bracket can go either way Then who's left? Only the young male voters. Is our candidate running for Miss Korea? Exactly! That's the direction we should take. Do you know why people don't vote? Because there's no point. We have to think of ways to excite voters and make them feel it's a carnival! That's how we can win. We have to make them pay close attention to this face. This way, we'll have a chance to publicize other things, won't we? Hold on! Okay. Let's just shoot both concepts first. Wait! We also have a concept in mind. We believe this is the best way to attract people's attention. "In the name of justice, I will punish you!" It gives the feeling that if you just wave your wand, all problems will be solved. What do you think? Enough! Enough! Enough! This is it. The intelligent image. Nice, nice! Very good! Be sexy, Mi-Rae! - Look over here a bit. Over here. - Is that person Korean? Is that a Korean? Good, good! Very good! The beauty of Korea. In this age of globalism, what is this? This looks ridiculous! Oh my. This is the concept that I'm advocating, the Michelle Obama concept. - Nice, nice. - Let's change to the next one. - Let's go and eat. - Time to eat. Bye. Let's all go and eat. Entrust your future to Mi-Rae! Wonder Woman Shin Mi-Rae It's in your hands to make Inju City a place where you can smile every day Let Mi-Rae be our future. Candidate No. 5 Shin Mi-Rae Look at this terrible poster. How can this girl have no fear in this world? It is said that someday, a person may drink the water from the well in which he had defecated. I, the great Min Joo-Hwa, should smell of poo from my mouth? Give your future to Stinking Mi-Rae! Wonder Woman Stinking Mi-Rae Let Mi-Rae be our future. Candidate No. 5 Stinking Mi-Rae. Does it feel more real now? Yes. I'm very nervous. It's just 5 against 1, I'll try my best and see. Boo-Mi took that picture of me during the Ms. Baendaengi Pageant. It's my favorite picture. It's not bad. A bit tacky. This is probably Wonder Woman's appearance before her sexy transformation, isn't it? It's already transformed. Crown, bracelet, look! Those things will appear only after transforming like this... this... What happened? The deposit check he gave bounced. So he's out of the race now. His nomination has been cancelled. Really? He helped out the other candidates. It's now 4 to 1 in just one day. It's starting quite well. I'm usually not like this when I hear about other people's misfortune. Assa! What motivated you to join the election? This is your second challenge after the Ms. Baendaengi Pageant. Are you confident? Yes. I... just want... money... I believe that money isn't everything in this world. I guess I'm running on pure courage. Your financial status was publicized, and it's quite different from your opponents'. Are those numbers negative? Why are they like that? - That... was my... - Ouch... my throat hurts. My dream is to create a credible society, so I can't say I have assets when I have none, although I really hope to have some. What percentage of votes do you think you'll get in the election? In the beginning, I was going to be satisfied with just 15%. But now that I have the confidence, I feel I'll get 100%! Due to other appointment, we will contact you when we officially hold a press conference. Sorry. Sorry. I have confidence. From now on, you have to consult me before speaking a single word. Understand? I'm hungry. I'm sleepy. I want to go to the bathroom. - Even these? - Of course. Fool, idiot, mutt, jerk! I love you. These too? Yes. It's me. Okay. I'll come over. Yes. I already had lunch. Hmm... I miss you too. Yes. Get off here. I have plans, so I'll drop you off here. Starting tomorrow, things will get more difficult. So today, just go home and rest. See you tomorrow. It's a commercial for our new line of organic products. Doesn't it look delicious? - Looks good. You can start filming. - Yes. How is business? A restaurant and an art gallery. Isn't it too tiring? Direct connection and customer satisfaction are equally important. Our gallery is quite popular. Some come to see the paintings, some come to see the pottery and china, and some come to see me. Anything new happening in the countryside? There seems to be. Do you know how difficult it is to keep up with you? Heard you resigned? Isn't that something new? I was shocked when you took a Deputy Mayor position in a small city in the countryside. But now you aren't even going to do that? There are certain things that a Deputy Mayor cannot do. Such as? {\a6}[*Office of the President] I guess it's called fast track to Cheong Wa Dae*. I'm currently preparing for the General Election. Are you saying you're going to run for Congress? I thought you'd be happy. But you haven't even done any preparation. How are you going to join the General Election? Are you bringing in village chiefs to prepare? Didn't know you could nag. Does the elder know? He probably does, since he has ears everywhere. By any chance, did he say he was going to help you? If he did, I'd be more hopeful. Even though he doesn't want to help me, he will when the time comes. I have strong backing. What do you mean? What strong backing? You. Do you want to take a stroll outside? Even though your method is a bit too much, you can use me. But when you enter the President's House, you have to let me walk beside you like now. Okay. I heard that your friend is also participating in the upcoming election. The person I saw in the hotel the last time. Is it true your name is also in your friend's campaign team list? Did Soo-In come to see you, too? I understand that to reap a good harvest in the fall, you have to first create good scarecrows. I like her because she looks foolish. Anyway, for your friend to become Mayor, my assistance is needed, isn't it? - Assistance? - Are you rejecting me? Don't be like this. Otherwise I'll misunderstand the relationship between you two. {\a6}Can I really fall in love with you? {\a6}Why do I feel so anxious? {\a6}I've never felt this way before. {\a6}You must be special. {\a6}I do not fear love, {\a6}even if separation will come soon. {\a6}However, I do not want this love, {\a6}because I will keep on yearning for more. {\a6}Like water freely flowing in the stream, {\a6}I will entrust my heart to you. {\a6}As each day passes, {\a6}I'll find something that needs to be thrown away one at a time. {\a6}If I have you by my side, {\a6}if I think about you, {\a6}if I love you, If you keep this up, I'll jump on you. I'm sorry. {\a6}if I leave you, {\a6}you seem like a person that will love me more. {\a6}Anxious love. {\a6}Even so, I like this love. Relax. I'll sleep outside. {\a6}I love on my own, I let go on my own. {\a6}This true love, {\a6}I've waited so earnestly for you, but {\a6}we are ill-matched. {\a6}An unfortunate love. {\a6}If I have you by my side, {\a6}if I think about you, {\a6}if I love you, {\a6}you seem like a person that won't stay long. {\a6}If I let you go, {\a6}if I leave you, {\a6}you seem like a person that will love me more. {\a6}Anxious love. Alba, it's me. Has Deputy Mayor arrived yet? Oh, he hasn't? No. I just have something to discuss with him. Okay. Bye. You came? Were you waiting for me? Me? No. I wasn't. I'll go in first. Campaign support? Everything needs money, beginning from maintainance of our campaign headquarters. We have to recruit workers starting tomorrow. Of course, there will be many volunteers helping out, but we need to maintain a certain number of more permanent staff. On top of those expenses, transportation and printed materials. Daily meal expenses are not small, either. How much will all these cost? Based on the 2007 averages, expenses ranged from 100 to 300 million won*. {\a6}[*USD80,000-24,000] 300 million? I couldn't tell Bureau Director Lee was this kind of a person. You should know that collecting campaign funds is illegal. Of course I know. That's why we can't collect. We can only borrow and write IOUs. - I thought you'd know these basics. - Of course I know. I was worried that it'd be troublesome if I was the only one who knew. We're finally on the same page. Well then, let's continue our discussion. Do you have land or real estate to mortgage? I'm assuming you don't have cash. How would I have any of those things? Is there any place where you can borrow? Ah, what about your mother's store? Isn't there a down-payment or something similar? {\a6}[*USD24] Are you crazy? The thought of lending 30,000 won* causes her to shiver. What should I do? Because I tried to pick up sesame seeds, I'll lost a watermelon. The campaign funds are like the registration deposit. As long as you get over 15% of the votes, they'll all be returned. If you really don't have any funds, I can lend you some. Are you out of your mind? You want to lend her what? No. It's not like that. You're still giving excuses when the situation is so clear? It's not like what? Do you think my ears are just accessories? You should have called before coming. - Isn't your camp busy? - Busy. It is crazily busy. I'm so busy that I wouldn't have come if it wasn't urgent. Come out with me for a moment. You're all turning a normal, happy couple into Romeo and Juliet. You don't seem that happy to me. Romeo. Go outside with her and hurry back. Romeo... Juliet... Are you out of your mind? If you want to help, you should help your father-in-law. What are you doing? Aren't you worried what others will say? You went to the beauty salon, didn't you? Your hairdo is beautiful! Should I go and straighten my curls? Why should you straighten them? Which bimbo will you show it to? Go and get them curly and more curly. Also, quit this camp right now. Do you know what that witch said to me? Her eyes glaring like a fox, she said she would become Mayor so that she could take revenge on me. Have I wronged her? I see friends can also pay each other back? Do you want to be my friend, too? Hey, Lee Jung-Do! Don't furrow your brow. It'll create wrinkles. We don't have to fight. I'll vote according to my beliefs, and you vote according to your beliefs. - Then it'll be fine. - How could that be fine? Dad was looking for you. Our campaign HQ has already opened. You should at least visit once, and help distribute some rice cake. You people are distributing rice cakes? Great idea! Go. Drive safely! Omo, you can't be serious. Despicable, you better not imitate our idea! Ahjumma, fighting! Smile. Today's goal is this red bean rice cake and smiling with your eyes. And don't underestimate Ms. Baendaengi's runner-up strength. Hello there! I am Ms. Baendaengi's runner-up Bong Sun-Hwa. Ms. Baendaengi's runner-up Bong Sun-Hwa is supporting Candidate No. 1, Min Yoo-Kam... Hey, hey! Directly endorsing a candidate like that is against campaign rules. Watch and learn from me. Hello Mother. Business is doing well, I hope? We recently rented an office in this building. This rice cake is soft, chewy, and very delicious. Oh, thank you very much! We're passing out rice cakes ONE-BY-ONE to show our appreciation. Yes. I'll enjoy this... It must be difficult working, isn't it? {\a6}[She's playing with words that sound like "No. 1"] I saw the weather report for today. The difference in day and evening temperatures is big. I hope you go home early, early, early today. Also, do you know why the number 1 is placed in the front of all other numbers? It's because it's the best. No, no. I'm not asking you to sponsor me. I'm asking to borrow from you. I'll definitely pay you back after the election... Hello? Hello? Yes, Sunbae. Have you seen the posters? So, it's nothing but, can you lend me some... Oh really? You bought a house. Of course, congratulations! Oh, there's no special reason for me to call. Just want to know how you're doing. Ms. Shin Mi-Rae has some urgent business to attend to. She's hanging up now. Hold on! How could you hang up on someone else's phone call like that? Get up. This is not the way to solve the problem. I know it's not, so please return 6.7 million won* to me before saying anything else. {\a6}[*USD5,360] Why aren't you returning it to me? Did you really believe he wired the money over? You should have found a better guy right from the start. He didn't return the money? So that means you've been lying to me? Why? Hurry, get up. I'll help you to resolve your campaign funds situation. Why are we here? Don't you need money? The person who wants to sponsor you is waiting inside. - Let's go in. - What are you saying? Who is waiting for me? A very wealthy person. What exactly are you doing? You should be able to guess. Politics and money are connected. An elections is not won with heart and soul. It is won with money. You should know this. I'm asking what you're doing right now. Do you know why candidates need sponsors? Since elementary school to college, your opponents have been making relationships. You spend on average 8,000-10,000* won on every person, {\a6}[*USD6.40-8.00] and more for food and alcohol. Eventually, it'll amount to a building or two. Do you think you can win based purely on your belief in winning? I said I would help you. But if you want to win, you need money. Go in. They're running a bit late. What does that person want? What would I have to give in exchange for the money? What can you offer besides your body? Are you saying to use my body in exchange? Do I have to sleep here tonight? The beds in this hotel are quite nice. You'll sleep comfortably. Have you taken your shower? You jerk! I won't do it! I won't stand for election. Isn't it just 10 million? I'll just pretend I bought rice cake with it. So don't ever show your face to me again, understood? Sorry. I got here late.

Fighting! If I become Mayor... How can she do politics? Even dogs and cats can do politics now. Is this Shin Mi-Rae's pledge? We are in this ship together. If you don't plan on getting off, then you should at least help. I'm sorry, everyone. I'm so sorry, everyone! Stupid woman, go away. I told you to go away. What are you guys doing? Stop it right now! Why didn't you shout? You usually have a lot to say. I heard you've helped her. Thank you. Why do you say "thank you"? Are you this woman's guardian, or is there something more?
