THE HUNTER'S SILENCE Over there! What's up? Freeze! Park ranger! Drop the animal and the shotgun. Come here! Raise your hands. Come on! Raise your hands and come down, easy. Everything's perfect here. Cover up. Next week I'll take you to Posadas, OK? and we do the ultrasound. Isabelino! I'm looking for Deafy, did you see him? I haven't. But if they didn't go with the jurua he must be back there. In the woods. That way. -Thank you. -In the woods. Deafy! Deafy! Let's go, it's your turn! Your were getting away from me! Let's go, I have to check how your back's doing. Has it been hurting? We'll check, now. PARK RANGERS' DETACHMENT "CERRO CINCO" PROVINCIAL PARK "EL DIAMANTE" Ismael. Where were you, if I may ask? I had to run home, my daughter was sick. And these two dummies? I heard gunshots coming out of the jungle. You're crazy, Ismael. You can't go all Rambo-like to face them alone. And what can I do, if my partner leaves me hanging? Huh? Wait, it's not like that. You have to learn to keep things apart, kid. Because if you're thinking about home all the time up here, you're going to go crazy. In the end you're neither here nor there. That's no good, for anybody. OK? OK, sorry. Have some breakfast, I'll take them. -I'll get some shut eye. -No. Eat and get ready. Let's go guys, get up. We're sorry. The number you're trying to reach We're sorry. The number you're trying to reach -Did you ask for a tow truck, ma'am? -What are you doing here? That's some attitude! Your mom called me. -Your husband? -Up in the park. How unusual, right? -You sure like to cause a fight. -I don't want to lose the habit. If they're going to send you with that thing over these paths... they should look after you more. Or give you a good truck. -Do you want to go to Posadas and fight over it? -Sure! I'll pick any fight for you. How manly. Brace yourself. Thank you. -Come home for lunch. -No, I can't. -I still have four settlements to go. -Come on! No, really, I can't. Leave them to fend for themselves for once. Listen, I come from checking on Deafy. That kid is getting worse. He can't work at the plantation anymore. He has to go back to school. -I'll see what I can do. -Please. At your service. Look! They're fresh. Cougar? Look at these grooves. It's a very heavy animal. Look at the size of these toes. It can't be. There aren't any tigers in the park. That they weren't seen doesn't mean they don't exist. There used to be a lot. You gonna tell me you saw one? I saw the last one that showed up here. Shit. You ran into it in the woods? I saw its body when the colonists where carrying it down. They were celebrating for three days Where are you going? It's no use tracking that cougar! Go back if you want! I'll see you at the base later. What happened? We were counting, and one was missing. So we went to look for it in the jungle and we found it. Look at the claw marks. OK. -Not a word to anyone about this. -OK. To anyone. Deafy! Come, let's go to the jungle! So your back's busted, huh? Well... I'll take you out of the plantation so you don't carry so much weight. We'll see where we can put you. Look. -Holy shit! -A cougar, was it? Hear that? - What? I can't hear anything. - Just that. Silence. When the tiger walks through the jungle nothing moves. Don't shoot just yet. Set your sights. Yes. Let's go. Give me that. Well done, Deafy. Have a drink to celebrate. These fucking greens Let's hit the road. What are you doing, Pole? Rude green. I was just leaving! What do you have there, Deafy? Drop it! Come on, Guzman! The kid hunted it, look how happy he is. I'm very sorry, kid. You can't do that here, it's a national park. OK, but let it slide! I promise it's the last time. Fuck off, Pole. It's always the last time with you. How many times did Agosto warn you? Drop the rifle, come on. Let's get it on the record. Let's go. The jungle is not yours, you can't go ordering people around. Let's go. If you don't stop now, I'm not only taking that turkey, I'll take your father's Mauser, too. You hear? Get the turkey while I get this on the record. Give me that animal! Hurry, Deafy, quick! Run! Pole, you motherfucker! Sons of bitches, Deafy! We showed him! Where's the turkey? You lost it? Well, that's OK. It's OK. He's a crazy motherfucker. Son of a bitch. Well, at least he left us dinner, right? Let's go, Isma! Hi, girls! What's up with the Paraguayans? What's up, baby? How are you, Commando? What are you doing, coming to the jungle without face paint? -Hi, how are you? -Guzman, how's it going? Let's go. -Hey kid -Take me home. -Hello, chief. It's strange. He lost it many times, but never to the point of shooting. Because he was wasted, for sure. We'll have to talk to him. Talk? How many times did we talk to him already? What do you want to do, Guzman? Press charges? He has to understand he can't do anywhere what he'd do in his farm. Tell me about the jaguar. It's not a jaguar. It's a cougar. Shut up, Oscarcito! It was a cougar. Where did you see a jaguar? When did you see a jaguar? When did I see? Bah. Guzman? It's a tiger. So, what we have to do before the colonists shoot the shit out of it is to take it to the other side of the park. Fine by me. And what do we do with Venneck? I'll talk to him tomorrow. If he's wasted, now is not the time to talk, Guzman. -I promise I'll talk to him. -OK, whatever you say. And don't tell anyone about this. Not your wives, no one. OK, Oscarcito? OK. Because you know how it is. One adds a little to the story, another adds a little more, And we end up having a convoy movie in the park. It's "cowboy". "Convoy", Oscarcito. It's "convoy". Here we say "convoy". What you said is how they say it in the United States. -See you. -See you. Hello, hello, hello... -I missed you. -Me too. -Me too. -My little jungle critter! -Want some wine? -Of course. -How is everything? -Fine. -Your week OK? -Yeah, quiet. -The hospital? -Fine. Well, better that way. Listen, my parents invited us to the barbecue at the club tomorrow. We don't have many excuses to miss it, now. -Come on, you always have a good time. -Sure. What's up with you? Nothing. Did something happen? We found the Pole hunting in the Park today, with Deafy. When we tried to stop him, he ran and shot at us. -He shot at you? -Uh-huh. What a menace. And I told him. What? That Deafy has to go back to school. And he took him to the jungle anyway. And when did you tell him that? Yesterday. I got stuck getting out of Tavá-mirí. Orlando got me out with his truck. I called my mom, and she called him. Great. Seems your mom doesn't lose hope of seeing you in white with the Pole. Cut it out! -What is it? -I don't get why didn't you call me. -I did! You never get a signal. -You could've called Agosto! -He lets me know by radio. -I tried to reach him, but couldn't. Whatever, never mind. Hey. You're not looking for a fight now, aren't you? Hey. Come on. Come on. Come on... You gave me hard time there, huh? Hello... -Guzman! -Chief... -You honor us with your presence! -How could I not? Mom, don't ask Orlando for any more favors on my account, OK? -And who would you have me ask? -Not him. Your dad's back hurts. -Guzman! -How are you? -I thought you were in the jungle. -I got back yesterday. Hi, Ana. -Hi, how are you? -Very well. You heard one of Basilio Hertzun's cows was killed, right? No, I didn't know anything. Big bites. Looks like a tiger. Could be a cougar on a killing spree. We'll see. -It's making a mess. -Let's not jump to conclusions. The asado's here This one. -Picked a good one there, huh? -Cheers. You're leaving, Cuis? Pole! How are you, Pole? -How are you, man? -Your father? Not so good. Go pay him a visit! -He'll get better. -For sure, he'll get better. And we'll have a barbecue like in the old times. Pole, I wanted to talk to you. The guys said you were hunting out in the jungle. Yes. It was the last time, I promise. But the last time you also told me that was the last time. You know I used to go hunt there with my old man. Yes, Pole. But you can't go hunting in the park anymore. -OK. -OK? I swear. Can I have this dance with the lady? Look at your face! I'm joking, man! Enjoy. Thank you so much! And we have a nice surprise! Among us, Orlando, the Pole! The accordion of the jungle What if we ask him to come up here? Pole! Pole! Thanks, thanks, friends! Cheers! Shall we play one? Let the music go on! Let the dance go on! Pole! The jungle's accordion! Let's see if the little tiger grabs on! The fortnight. I added a little extra so you buy yourself a nice dress or something. You always wear the same thing. You're welcome. Thank you. -Don't leave him alone, OK? -I won't. Bye, old man. Hey, Deafy! Come, let's go to the jungle! Look, I brought you these sneakers from Brazil. Go check if I got the size right! Good day, ma'am! Yes. No, don't worry! We'll bring him right back. We'll take care of him. That's it. Watch out. Watch out, watch out! Bye. Don't worry! Did you get that? She's got 7 kids she can't even feed and she gives me the stink eye for taking care of this one. These people, man... With how hot things are now, Pole, perhaps it's better to go to the 78. The 78's shit, we always leave empty-handed. Yeah, but remember, you told Agosto we wouldn't come back to the park. So what? Our grandfathers and our fathers were the ones who cleared the first paths. The first schools, houses, everything. Are we gonna let some uniformed monkeys run us away? It's just that before, wherever you looked there was jungle, now there's so little left... So, we're to blame that they razed it to plant pines? -He's right about that. -You bet. How long since the three of us went in? Those greens can go fuck themselves I don't want trouble with those folks, Pole. So beat it, Pigu. Fuck off! -Fuck off, man! -What? No way, you know I want in. -Oh you want in? -You bet I want in. -So? -OK, enough, cut it out, you two. Since you started preaching God's word, all you talk is nonsense. Basilio's wife said they found a calf they'd lost in the middle of the jungle. -It had chunks this big missing. -That old man is a liar. If Basilio said it, I believe him. Wasn't Basilio with those guys that time your old man killed the tiger? No way! He just went to be in the photo. He was there, Tateto. He helped get the tiger down to the farm. They needed six men to carry it. I remember perfectly. At that age, it seemed huge to me. Its claws were this big. Its head was huge. And its fur... I never saw something like it again. Well, perhaps you're lucky and you see it today. God willing. What's that? Dogs. God damn it! Brazilians, and with dogs. So in two hours I'm leaving for Cerro Cinco and tomorrow morning we go out on patrol. I'm letting you know because I have to. If it were up to me, I wouldn't. Listen to me, Guzman! Stay there with Sara for some peace and quiet! You're not leaving anyone, we can survive perfectly without you! Well, I know you. Bye, bye. Who was it? Agosto. There's a patrol. -You're going? -I can't rest easy knowing there's a poacher up there. I'm ovulating. We talked about this. I know, love. I know, but I can't leave them alone. I'll come back early tomorrow. OK? If I tell you you have to stay, you have to stay! You're stubborn, man! I spent my life in this jungle! My son doesn't even call me. I have two grandsons, I don't know them. My wife went to Buenos Aires to meet them. And I was in the jungle. In the jungle! I'm telling you so the same doesn't happen to you, you know? This is too much for me, already. I'm retiring at the end of the year. You're going to have to take charge of everything. I'm letting you know, Guzman. What are we doing here? This one also got it in his head to come! I love you -What are you doing? -I'm not about to leave you alone, man! -Let's go, she's mad. -Quick. Remember when Tateto fell down in the jungle? Go fuck yourself, man. -How can I forget? -He bounced down! Epic fall! Show it, Tateto! - Don't bust my balls, man! - Let's see how it is now! -Come on! Show Deafy! -Come on! I'll show Deafy. -It looks really bad. -Is it me, or is that looking more and more like a dick? -Fuck! You scared the shit out of us! -What are you scared of? -What is it, brother? -Nothing, The greens got to our camp, they stopped everything, they took everything, -I was left with nothing. -Naturally. If you bring dogs the only thing you manage is to scare the animals and draw the greens. The dog is to track the tiger. Well, you're here now. -Come, sit down, brother. -I thank you. Now he'll stay forever. Easy, Pole. He'll get warm and keep going. He understood. ... And right there, I just went for her. And she was with that dress... Shut your trap, 9-year-olds can't even get it up! Shut up, idiot! Sure it gets up! I learned to fuck before learning how to ride a bike! You don't even know how to ride a bike. Stop fucking around! Go to sleep! It's late, guys! You're like a bunch of kids... I need to be scolding you... To sleep, goddamit! Stop drinking baldie ... to sleep Tidy up this mess you left, come on This shit's all yours Smells so bad in here Look who's back. This son of a bitch is laughing in our faces. Guys! Hey! Come here. Let's surround them. Guzman, you go right, take Oscarcito. And you go left, wide open through there. You stay with me. You look very eager to shoot. But really, guys, be careful. Very careful. I shout at them to freeze, and we all charge in together, OK? OK? Guzman. Careful, OK? Let's go! Let's go, guys! Freeze! Park ranger! Stop shooting, Pole! Take a hike and we'll stop shooting! You're all going to jail! -Let's get out of here! -Are you crazy? We have to shoot, these greens will run out of ammo right away. Shoot! Fuck! Stop it! We're all neighbors! There he is! Freeze, monkeys! Oscarcito, wait! -Freeze right there! -On the ground! Let me see! Let me see! Let go. Let me see. Come on! Come here! Pick him up. We'll take him down to the hospital, he's bleeding out. Turn around I said... And you too On the ground! Shut that dog up Are you stupid, Pole?! On the ground! On the ground, motherfucker! Hey! Look at me! Look at me! Hang in there, we're almost there! Come on, Bebe! Hurry up! Don't fall asleep! We are getting there! Come on! come on! -Hello? -Hello, Sara? Yes? They just let us know that they're bringing from the jungle a park ranger with gunshot wounds. Who is it? We don't know. You don't know? Tell me truth. Is it Ismael? No, we don't know who it is yet. -I'm on my way. Yes, yes, we'll be here. -What happened? -Oscarcito. -Are you OK? -Yeah, I'm OK. I'll go check. Pole! A visitor. -How is the kid? -He's alright. The bullet went through his collarbone, but that's it. You're getting big for these kinds of mess-ups. It was an accident. -Anything you need, I'm up front. -Hey, hey, Ramiro, wait. And the guns? What happened? I don't know, they'll get here tomorrow. I'll let you know. OK. I owe you a barbecue. Yeah, you owe me three already. Look what I brought you. You like it. -I spoke with Pauluk today. -What did he say? He's speaking with the judge. You go testify tomorrow or the day after and they can't hold you much longer. Good morning... Hi, Fabi. Were you able to get some rest? Let's see how it is. Let's see... Excuse me... What are you doing here? I'm very sorry about what happened, ma'am. I can't believe they let you go already. Ma'am, it was an accident. The kid threw himself at me, I didn't mean to do it. I came to tell you that I'm willing to cover all the expenses. I don't give a shit about who you are! Get out of here, now! Beat it! -It was an accident. -Can't you see you're bothering her? -Wait, Isma. -Beat it. -Wait, wait, easy. -Beat it! -Go on, get out. Beat it! -Isma, stop. You, this way. What is his problem? What are you doing here? I came to speak with Oscarcito's wife. It's not the right time. -It was an accident, Sara. -It doesn't matter. -These people can't receive you now. -Why not? It was an accident, Sara. What's happening with the tiger? We're worried... the whole town is worried... All they do is talk... but I'm afraid for our kids Hello. Yes. What are the mayor and the park rangers waiting for? Oh, perfect. OK, OK. Don't forget that there's a law that protects these animals. OK, I will. Bye. So? What if something happens to one of our kids? What then? Love, can you stop by the Japanese's? He's left some seedlings for me. -Yeah, sure. Who was it? -No one, work. Take care. You too. Bye. -Good evening, lads. -Good evening, sir. Hello, good evening. Good evening. -What's up, Guzman? -How are you, Alvado? -Good, you? -Very good. I brought you everything. Here's a copy of the record so you can check. Perfect. What a mess, huh? Do you know when you'll be sending all this? We'll have to see. It's not our only task. OK. -See you. -Bye, see you. Yes, good day. This is agent Guzman, from Diamante National Park. Look, I think there's been a mistake with a shipment of seized weapons. I need to check some serial numbers I have here with me with the ones on the weapons in storage. Every weapon is in storage but the Pole's Mauser. That is, there's a Mauser there, but it's not the one we seized. What a coincidence, the serial number is blurry in their copy of the record. Enough is enough, Agosto! We have to let the judge know. Look, Guzman. I'll leave in your hands. After all, from now on you'll be the one making these decisions. -I'm tired already... -Stop messing around, Agosto... As I was saying, I'm setting you free. But I ask of you, whatever you do, think it through. I know this town very well, you know? And every thing you do, has its consequences. Guzman think it through. -Good morning, miss. -Good morning. -Is Mr. Orlando Vennek home? -Just a moment. Nice kid. -Good day, Sheriff. -How are you, Pole? Look... I'm sorry, but we have to search your house. I have a court order. -Come in. -Well, excuse us, then. You check around here. Guzman, you come with me! If you want you can be present during the search, Pole. Do your job, it's fine. Well, it's fine by us. I'm sorry, Mr. Vennek. Let's get in on record! We're not searching anymore? What else do you want to do? Search the old man's underpants? Look at how things turn out! I used to invite you to come over to play and now you come uninvited. We finish with the record and we'll be on our way, OK? Do you want something to drink? -A glass of water, please. -Make that two! Juana! Bring water to the men. There you have to put down the serial number, It seems that these are the new forms... -Water? -No, thanks. Under the old man's bed. It's confusing, but don't worry... Orlando -I'll go to the bathroom real quick. -OK. It's all OK...just a little bureaucracy Hey! Deafy! Come here! Don't run! Come! Are you ok, kid? I'm sorry, Deafy. I didn't mean it, son. Here is what we were looking for! You're disgusting, Guzman. Didn't that Paraguayan who sired you teach you not to snitch? No way he did, he was even more two-faced than you are. Wait, Pole. When he was working here we couldn't take our eyes off him. You turned around and he was already stealing something. Easy! You're a resentful son of a bitch you cuckold motherfucker. Stop looking at me like that, you piece of shit! -We let you rant already. Let's go, Pole! -Let me go! Hey! Where are you going with that? I'm taking it to Posadas myself! Easy, calm down. It's gonna be fine. Hello. -What are you doing with that here? -I had to get a court order that son of a bitch got it through back channels and replaced with another. You can't trust anyone in this town. Oh, Isma, this is getting out of control. Someone has to give. Really? He thinks he can do whatever he wants and I'm wrong for putting my foot down? Forget Orlando, think about us. I think about us constantly, love. But that doesn't mean I'll stop doing my job. Listen, the Pole's like that. He's not going to change. The only one who can listen to reason here is you. -I'm doing what has to be done. -No, you're not. You're taking it personal. Leave it be! Oscar is about to testify. Let it run its course. Listen... I got a call from Posadas. They want me to take charge of the program at a regional level. Look at that. And when were you planning on telling me? When did you want me to tell you? I barely saw you. I think it'll be good for us. Moving there, starting over. Yeah? And my job? What would I do there? You could work in Park Management, you'd have a lot more influence there. There are enough clerks, Sara. What we need is people willing to risk it in the jungle. Don't close yourself to the possibility. Think about it. Agosto is retiring. He's naming me Park chief. What? He told me a few days ago. Look at that. When were you planning on telling me? Wait, wait, wait! -What is it? -Pull out. Why? I don't know, I don't want to. The jungle is different... See you tomorrow. What are you doing here? Did something happen? Guzman, you came down. Can you explain to me what's up? Are you OK? What is it? Can't I come home if I feel like it? What were you doing? Tell him. Go on, tell him! What do you have to tell me? That I won't be going back to the Park. I quit. Put yourself in my place, I have to think about my family. And will you do? We settled with Venneck so we don't go to court. I have a daughter, Guzman. He gave us some money, we'll use it to open a grocery store. Do you realize what you did? Everything that happened? Everything we did was for nothing! You're leaving me alone, brother. You're a traitor. -Tone it down a notch... -You shut up! This isn't your business. Let's go. Come on, Oscar! Let's go. Let's go! I had to speak to him, not you! Why are you like that? See you when I get back. Call me if anything happens. Take care. Bye. Good morning... Sarita! What a nice surprise! I need to speak with you. Do you have minute? Sure. -Want some wine? -No, no, thanks. Come in. Excuse me. Come in, have a seat. Coffee, tea? Water? Water. Juana! Bring a jug of iced water. And lemons. Tell me. This can't go on. -What? -You know what I'm talking about. You both have to stop. It's getting out of control. Is that what you want? -It got a little out of hand, yes. -Not just a little. It's crazy. Look, Sara. I don't want trouble. I know you're having a hard time with this. I am too. Besides... Look, on my account... I promise all is forgiven. Are you sure? You have my word. Thank you. This is fine. Thank you. You can go. -Lemon? -Yes. Thank you. -Is it good? -Yes. Remember your dad's face when we'd tell him we were going to get some lemons? You remember... Yeah... We'd come back really sweaty, with two lemons in each hand. -It wasn't very believable, wasn't it? -No... We had a good time. We got along well, you and me. We should've never broken up. You know that too, don't you? Now we could make it work. I learned a lot from my mistakes. My Sarita. Wait, wait, wait. Wait. I'm sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry. -Come. -I have to go. No, don't go. Come. Stay. -Stay. OK? -I have to go, really. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Wait, Sara. Sara, don't go. I promise I won't do anything more. Just go check on the old man. Please, he's getting worse and worse and I don't know what to do. Besides, he'll be happy to see you. -OK. -Yeah? I'll go for a minute to see him and then I'm off. Come on. This way. It's causing disasters I totally understand what you're saying -Yes, you understand but -What do you want me to do? -What can I do? -The cages are absolutely useless. It's like it sniffs them out. We have to do what we did before, that's the solution. One at a time, guys, or I can't understand you. It's like what Don Manuel did. Agosto, we have to work this out between neighbors, like always! So, I have to let you go up to the jungle to kill the tiger? No way! How many times did I tell you to buy buffaloes? Buffaloes are good for nothing. We don't want them! Buffaloes are the natural barrier. If I let you through to kill that animal, I'll be facing the government, the environmentalists, the ministry, the media... My people and me would end up on the street. Would that be fair? No, but it's also unfair if we have to sit and watch as we run out of cattle. -But let's sit and talk it through... -Wait, wait! What is it? This can't go on. We need a solution now. Let's look for a solution, but one that's convenient for everyone. I don't think so. I thank you for coming to talk to us, but... Manuel Vennek died. He's gone. Sara... -Let's go grab a bite to eat. -No, I'm not hungry. Come on, let's go! It'll be good for you. No, really, you go. I'm not feeling up to it. What I want is to be with you. You really feel so bad about that old shitbag? Don't say that about him! Manuel was always very generous with me. Really, now? The family was so close, and I came to fuck it all up, right? It was obvious you were going to say something like that. -You forget what he did for your dad, too! -My dad? -Yes, your dad! -And what did he do? Besides exploiting him day and night for $2,50! Come here. -Good morning... -Morning. Is Venneck home? No, he went out. -Do you know what time he'll be back? -He didn't say. -Do you want to wait for him? -No. Why did you help me the other day? Because someone has to put him in his place. -Thank you. -Wait. I found this while cleaning the other day. I think it's your wife's. Come on guys, let's go! There...listen... the dogs have gone crazy! Come on, keep going... hurry up.. Quick, quick... or the tiger will get away. We have to let the Pole know, that the tiger's around here. Where is he? He went to the tree stand... says he isn't leaving without the tiger. Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch! Help me... Help me... -You bitch! -Let go! -You bitch! -Let go, now! What happened? Deafy? Deafy, what happened? Did you get hurt? Deafy, are you hurt? Whose blood is this? Deafy... Whose blood is this? Show me! No! No!
