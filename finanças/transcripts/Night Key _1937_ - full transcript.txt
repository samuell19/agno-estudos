Now, all you have to do when you wanna lock up at night is take this key, put it in there like that. Give it a turn, and that turns on the juice. The juice? Yes, the electricity that runs through all the wires that we've rigged around your doors and windows. We can't do it. You gotta take 'em all off. Why? She don't want no dead body around here. She say the crook could get electrocute. Oh, no, no, no, now, look, Mr. spinelli. If anyone comes around here and tampers with any of the doors or windows, it breaks the contact. You see that? All right, that turns on a light in my office. 601, new installation testing. Wants an okay. 637, in for the night. 667, in. 593, closed. There, it's in running order. Oh, so you won't kill him? No, no, we catch him. That's all right. All right, Mr. and Mrs. spinelli. Your worries are over because the ranger protective system is... = the best of its kind in the world. This has been demonstrated through 20 years of service to merchants, banks, department stores and homes in every city in the land. Just a moment, Mr. ranger. All right, sir. Therefore, I feel on this 20th anniversary of the ranger protective service that I have every reason to be proud of this system which I have invented. Oh, hello, Adams. Come on in. Let's see, where was I? "Of this system which I have invented." Yes. All right, just type that up and have it ready for the reporters when they come in. Come on in, Sam. Well, what do you think? Well, I've just finished going over these prints of Mallory's. The man who really invented your present system. Well, he's got an invisible beam alarm system so good that, well, if another company gets hold of it, you'll be out of business in a year. = yeah. Well, if you think so, I suppose I'll have to do business with Mallory. Yes, but will he do business with you? = I've taken care of that. He's coming up here with his lawyer tonight. That's great, Steve. You'll never regret it. You see, he doesn't use any wire. For instance, he has a beam set up between two points, and anything coming through them, like this, breaks the beam and registers in the office. It's an ingenious thing, and it would take somebody like Mallory to think of it. Mallory, get your hat. - Huh? - Get your hat. Ranger wants to talk business with you. On my terms? Everything. 50% of all royalties, full supervision of all installation, and a big cash advance on signing the contract. I never thought Steve ranger would consent to that. Why not? You've got something here would put him out of business, haven't you? And don't forget, I'm a pretty good lawyer. Come on, come on. Yes. I've been working on this thing for 15 years! It's hard to realize I finally got it done in time. = time? Time for what? Oh, nothing. Your eyes bothering you? That's what I meant when I said "in time". It's been a kind of a race between my eyes and what I was trying to do, get it done before they gave out altogether. Have you seen a doctor? As many as I could afford. Well, from now on, you will be able to afford... = wait a minute. T want to take this with me. What's that? A key. A key? That thing? = that's what I call it. This is responsible for my inventing the whole new system of electrical protection that we're going to sell to ranger. Yes? How's that? Because this breaks through the old system completely. I just thought he might be interested in seeing it. Hi, dad. Hello, Mr. kruger. Hello, miss Mallory. Hello, darling. Do you mind if I meet you in ranger's office in, say, half an hour? = sure. I understand. You want to tell her the good news, eh? = that's it. Fine. I'll see you down there. Good-bye. Good-bye. Then it is good news? I'm on my way to sign the contract now. = you mean we're rich? Well, at least you won't have to stand in the cashier's cage of that restaurant anymore. No more soup spots and no more smell of cabbage? No, darling. A cottage, and the smell of roses and a lot of new clothes for you. Oh, wonderful! And we'll have a yacht, and a string of racehorses, and two boxes at the metropolitan, one for each of us. No, no, no, no. We can't afford two boxes now. We'll just have to scrape along on one. Well, anyway, we'll have enough to buy you a new hat, and we'll cremate this one. No, no, no! You give that to me, you young rascal. My goodness. Oh, dad, I'm so happy, because what it really means is that you're going to have a rest. And we're going to get the best specialists in the world to look at your eyes. 601! 601, right. Spinelli"s clothing store, 528 Hanover street. Spinelli's clothing store! Holy mackerel! I'll bet mama spinelli got caught in the door. Come on, Mike. Ranger wants you and me to take care of this one, special occasion. Yeah? What for? Come on, you'll find out. Well, if it isn't petty Louie! You know, Louie, you're slipping. They're wearing fur-lined coats this season. Now don't be tough on me. I got, you know, I got amnesia, that's all. Besides, how'd I know you had the joint wired? = come on! Oh, don't be tough on me, door shaker. T ain't done nothin'. I just got locked in this store by mistake. Louie, I'm afraid we'll have to take you along in this little pinch-back model for evidence. Such a nice fit too. It's all right, Mike. Just a moth we found in the woolen department. What is it, Jim? Animal, mineral or vegetable? Aw, cut it out, will you? Yeah, and ranger waiting up there at the office with a reception committee to celebrate his anniversary. Say, what are you gonna do with me? If we catch enough like you, we're gonna make a skunk coat. = you door shaker! What? You gonna turn me over to the cops? = I'll turn you over my knee if you don't keep your trap shut. Come on. You were very smart \to bring this directly to me. I appreciate it. Here. = thanks. Oh! Thank you, Mr. ranger. = not at all. I can always use a smart lawyer in my business. Oh, by the way, you understand of course that when Mallory gets here, I'll have to do a little acting, when I discover that I've made a costly legal error. Yeah, I understand. You'd better wait outside. = but this ain't constitutional! It says in the constitution every man's entitled to love, Liberty and the pursuit of happiness. But not free overcoats, yet. Now, wait a minute. This is kidnapping. You gotta turn me over to the cops. Hey! I ain't used to a joint like this. Oh, but you're a special guest. I don't like the way he said that. Oh, hello, Mallory. Here you are. He'll be ready for us just as soon as he's through with this gentleman. Come and sit down. Well, what's his name? Petty Louie. He's a door matter. Takes chances only on petty larceny raps. Is that all you could dig up? Well, we have to take them as they come, sir. Why didn't you get your winter outfit from the salvation army? I ain't takin' no charity! You know what you are? Well, I've been called most everything. Let's hear it. You're our 10,000th customer, the 10,000th crook we've turned over to the police in 20 years' operation. Well, do I get a prize or somethin'? You'll get all that's coming to you. Why couldn't you have been a big-time crook? I've asked myself that question a hundred times. I think I'm shy. = put him in the detention room. = in the what? Will you come in now, Mr. Mallory, Mr. kruger? All right, go along. Well, Dave, it's been a long time. Hello, Steve. I'm glad to see you. I didn't know whether you would be or not. = of course I am. Here. Sit down here. Well, if we're going to work together again, I'm quite ready to forget what happened. Now, that's the spirit. It'll be like old times. I hope not. Well, I didn't mean that... Oh, have you got those contracts ready? All ready, Mr. ranger. Are these the papers that my attorney okayed yesterday? Yes, that's right. Mm-hmm. Well, Dave, I've been over your plans very thoroughly. You've done a marvelous job. I've been working at it for a long time, and I know it's a great improvement. Sign right here, Mr. Mallory. Right there, Dave. And here's a check for $500 advanced royalties. Thank you. Now, just how soon do you plan to start the installation? I'd like to go over it with your engineers. Well, I'll let you know about that. I know, but couldn't you give me some idea? I'll have to make my plans accordingly. Oh, there's no sense in hurrying this thing. It's going to cost me a lot of money to put in this system. There's plenty of time. I'm sorry, but there isn't. I'm afraid my eyes... But your old system is working perfectly. There's really no good reason to change it. Just a minute, Steve. You've agreed to put in my new system. It's in the contract. Sure, it's in the contract, but it doesn't say when, does it? Just what do you mean? I mean I can put it in now or 10 years from now, or a thousand. = wait a second! Let me look at that contract again. Here. Here it is. Here's the installation clause right here. Does it say when? Well, it doesn't state the day, or the hour, or the minute. But I never dreamed that would be necessary with a man of your business standing. = wait. Can he do this? This is the most outrageous thing I've ever heard. He's hiding behind a ridiculous technicality. He's standing on the letter of the law, and not the spirit of this contract. What do you hope to gain by it? = t think I know. Well, look here, he can't... I'd like to talk to Mr. ranger alone. But I'm your attorney. = t know. I'll send for you if I need you. Don't accept any compromise. I'll drag this thing into the highest court in this state if it's necessary. Well, what have you got to say? Now, listen, Steve. Twenty years ago you robbed me of the patent rights of the system that you're now using. Perhaps there was some excuse for that. Because it gave you wealth, success, position. All the things that tempt one man to Rob another. But now that you have everything and I have nothing, what possible reason is there for you to do this to me again? I'm doing this for my daughter. Why should you want to punish her? You're imagining things, Dave. This was just a good business deal. I bought your ideas because if I didn't, somebody else would. But don't you see how cruel that is? You can't take 15 years of a man's life and lock them away in a desk drawer. It's too late for me to make another start. Steve, I'm going blind. Well, I could advance you something from time to time. I can get backing somewhere else. = I'm afraid it's a little late for that. = you can't hold me to... Yes? Captain Wallace and the reporters are here. = t'll be with them in 2A minute. Dave, I'm going to be pretty busy. Do you mind going out that door? You haven't changed, have you? But I have. Steve, you're going to put in my system whether you like it or not. = t doubt it. You forget. What I create, I can destroy. Oh, hello, captain. Mighty nice of you to come around, help me out. Not at all, Steve. It's a pleasure. Hi, Mr. ranger. Hello, boys. Hello, George, Harry. Hello, Paul. Hello, Mr. ranger. What's the gag? = never mind. I got a little surprise for you. A good story. You go over there and sit down, make yourselves comfortable. Psst! Hey, mister, come here a minute. Are you one of ranger's mob? = no. I'm gonna complain to the police. They ain't got no right keeping me in here. I'm a citizen, ain't I? I got constitutional rights, ain't I? Would you like to get out? =- would I? Don't touch that lock, mister! This door's hooked up with all the bells in the joint. Don't worry. You won't hear a single bell when I open this door. Hey, that thing won't blow up, will it? = no. Ooh, I get it. Scientific, huh? Say, ain't that somethin! Come on. = just hold that a minute. And so, as an anniversary present, I'm going to turn over this criminal to captain Wallace in your presence. I get it. Petty Louie is public enemy number 10,000, huh? = yeah. Right. But before the ceremony, I'd like to show you around the plant. I've put all the details in these typed interviews, but I thought you'd like to see the plant in operation. Sure, sure. Now, if you will step this way. = this is the control room. Now, the reports of watchmen come in on these ticker tapes. Over here, this system of relays is for fire control. But it's this board that enables us to prevent crime. An illegal entry into any establishment protected by the ranger system flashes an alarm signal on this board. = nol! The back way. Those numbers correspond with numbers... Hello, we're in luck. There's an entry now. Now watch what happens. 547. All right, all right! Come on, what's the delay? Why, that's our own detention room. What? Cover all exits! Travers, Callahan! Come quick! Well, it's empty. He's gone. Well, the alarm's working. Yeah, but it didn't ring 'til after he'd finished. Well, why didn't it? What was wrong? That guy must be a wizard. = a wizard? Petty Louie? Well, the little cockroach outsmarted your million-dollar system. This is a story. Say, ranger, come here. Take a look at this. "What I create, I can destroy.” - What does that mean? - Who's that signature? Night key? Ooh, that'll look good on the front page anyhow. Night key, huh? It wasn't petty Louie. Well, then who was it? It was... Yeah? Well, I don't know, but I'll find him. Come on, Travers. Now, wait a minute, Steve. Are you hinting that you want me to go away? Now, look, boss. Don't make the mistake of judging a man by his clothes. I just had a bad season, that's all. Why, there was a time when my name was legion. Did you ever hear of petty Louie? Now, I've always played it safe, see? I've ducked the big raps. But with you, I'd be willing to take in more territory. Why, with your brains and my personality, the world is our oyster. Aml in? Now, look. I got you out of ranger's for a purpose. I'm not a crook. I don't want to have anything to do with crooks. The best way you can show your gratitude is to leave me alone. Then you don't want me? = no. =t ain't in? = no. = oh. Oh, pardon me, old man. Oh, he'll be run over! Stop him, somebody! Hey, wait a minute. Easy, boss. There you are. Thank you. My glasses! I'm afraid they're busted, boss. You'd better let me take you home. Then you'll have to. Okay. I can be useful to you in more ways than one. You know, as I said before, I've worked with some of the biggest shots in the business. Here we are, boss. Gee, swell joint too. Well, I'm afraid it's not very swell, Louie. = it looks swell to me. Here we are, boss. Thanks, Louie. I'll be all right now. This makes us even. You ain't gonna give me the air, are you, boss? I can sleep anywhere. I'll sleep on the floor. No, Louie. I'm afraid that won't work out. Here. Now, you get yourself a room and just forget about it. Good night and thank you. Joan? Joan? = dad! Oh, there you are. = what's the matter? I dropped my glasses on the street. Can't you see me? Of course, dear. It's just a little blurred, that's all. There's an old pair somewhere on the mantle. Oh, that's better. Oh! You've got one of those for me? Have I? = there! = now do we celebrate? Certainly. Why not? Fine. Fine, come on. = welll are we going to have a banquet? We certainly are. Caviar, nightingale's tongues, and a good cup of coffee. Say, I could use it. Well, you sit right here "til I fix it. Is Mr. ranger as pleased and excited as we are? = t think he's excited. Why don't you answer? Yes, sir. Have you got kruger yet? No, sir. Well, keep after him. We've got to get Mallory's address. You realize that if he can do this right under our noses, he can do it anywhere. = what's his reason? He's trying to ruin me. He's upsetting my plan... We got kruger. Here's Mallory's address. = good! Now, you get down there and bring Mallory in here. Keep on the job until you get him. I haven't got a warrant, you know. = never mind that! Bring him in here. Yes, sir. But why? Why does he do these things to you? Because Steve ranger can't forget that your mother married me instead of him. = oh. It's all right, Joan. I'm stronger this time and better prepared. I'm afraid you'll have to hold your job at the restaurant a little longer. =t don't mind that. It's going to be a little difficult. I may have to do some things that perhaps you won't understand. Who is he, dad? What does he want? It's all right, dear. It's petty Louie, I know him. Hey boss, you'd better beat it. The door shakers are downstairs! Ranger's mob, they're gonna get ya! Oh, dad! Get my hat and coat and my little bag. Thanks, Louie. No, no, come out this way. You go out that door, they'll get you sure. Right. Let me go with you. No, no, no, my dear. Now, you stay here, and I'll get in touch with you just as soon as I can. All right. Now, don't be alarmed, dear. Everything will be all right. Yes? Who is it? Ranger protective service. We're looking for Mr. Mallory. I'm sorry, Mr. Mallory isn't here. I'm sorry, but we'll have to check on that. Well, just a minute! You can't come in here. Please get out of my room or I'll have you put out. It would take the army and Navy to do that, sister. But you can't do this! Have you a warrant? We don't need none. You just take it easy, and everything will be all right. Well, what do you mean you don't need a warrant to come into a person's house like this? Now, don't get excited. Now just a minute, Mike. The young lady is perfectly correct. We have absolutely no right in here. Well, I'm glad you realize that! In fact, our presence here constitutes nothing less than unlawful entry. Well then, what are you doing here? Besides, being an intelligent person, she knows what she's talking about. You're so very kind, Mr... Travers, Jim Travers. You're Mrs. Mallory? Miss Mallory. Oh, miss Mallory. Excuse me. Mr. Travers. Yes? If you're looking for the door, it's over there. = of course. Stupid of me. I always lose my sense of direction in a strange room. Mikel we'd better be going. Must you go? Yes, I'm afraid we must. We don't want to outstay our welcome. Also, we always try to be considerate and kind. It must be wonderful to be a door shaker. As a matter of fact, it is. Sometimes the doors open, and we meet the most charming people. Good night. = door shaker! Hey Mike, you hop right down to the office and report. He got away down the fire escape, but I've got a hunch he's gonna try to get in touch with the girl. So you tell him I'm gonna stick right here. Okay. - Well. - Hello. I've changed my plan. Do you mind if I wait? = of course not. Make yourself right at home. Oh, if the janitor doesn't throw you out tonight, he'll thaw you out in the morning. Now, you mean to say this thing short-circuits the juice runnin' through the alarm wires? Not exactly. As a matter of fact, I match the frequency of the current with this shortwave set, so that when the doors open the contact isn't broken. Now, go ahead and try the door. See that? Nobody could do it no quicker. Aml in? Ain't that wonderful? Duck! Get down! It's okay, boss! Come on. Now, you're sure that machine of yours won't stop working? = of course not. But when we go, if I leave the door open and turn the machine off, then the alarm will sound in ranger's office. I getit, I get it. Now, let's get to work. Louie! Put those back. Aw, gee, boss! It's just a couple of tickers. Now, you know what you promised me. Put them back. Now, you come with me. Take this. Boss, I underestimated you. In the corner over there, Louie. = but the door's over therel over there, in the corner. 857. Fidelity jewelry company. 201 Morton Lane. Come on, ed. "There is so little time left. "Night key." Boy, he's new. Let me see that, will you? All right, fellows. Go on, we can handle this. Go ahead around in the back. Hey, buddy, hold a minute, will you? Why... Okay, that's it. = wait a minute. I thought you were going to stay and watch the room. Well, your father may never come back to the room, but I've got a hunch he'll come back to you sometime. At least I would, if you were my daughter. I don't want to annoy you any more than I have to, but will you please tell me where I can get in touch with your father? = t don't know! Okay. Do you mind if I eat breakfast here? No, please do. The food's terrible. = thanks. Good morning. Here you are. = thanks. What's the use of having electricity? This guy walkedright through the juice. He's... Ruining my system, making me the laughingstock of the whole city. I've got the entire... Metropolitan police force on the trail of the mysterious night key, who has walked through the alarm systems of 12 business establishments in this city during the night, leaving no trace except the defiant note, "what I create, I can destroy.” Now, for the situation in Spain... I never heard of any big shot called night key. The funny part of it is, the guy takes all the trouble to get in these joints and then doesn't glom a thing. Must be some screwy amateur. Or an electrical genius. Well, you know how often I've tried to break down that ranger system for you, kid. And I've never been able to do it. I don't know what his racket is, but a guy with a talent like that should be working for me. It says here petty Louie was with him. Find petty Louie. Okay, kid. = "none of the establishments entered has "suffered any losses except at b&g smoke shop, "which reported one calabash pipe as taken.” = Louie. All these things have got to go back to where they came from. = what a sense of humor! Well... What are we doing tonight? We strike just once more. A really important place this time. I don't know what your plan is, boss, but I think if you was more legitimate and just cleaned out these joints you crashed, there'd be more profit in it. Now, Louie... Okay, okay. Just a suggestion. Get out of this traffic as soon as you can. I think he's right behind us. Hey, swing over to eighth Avenue at the next corner and then step on it. = fine. Now, turn right at the next corner. If you think you're being funny, you're wrong. You've been following me for two days and I can't stand it anymore. I'm just as tired of it as you are, miss Mallory, but I've got... If you don't get out of my way, I'm going to call the police. Now, Dan Harrigan's on this beat. He's an awfully nice fellow too. Oh, will you stop it? I'm not joking. Neither am I, miss Mallory. Listen, I have a message for you. = from father? No, from Mr. ranger. Don't talk ranger to me. Oh now, wait a minute, Joan... Miss Mallory. All right then. Miss Mallory. But from what I've seen of you in the last few days, I think your dad must be a pretty swell fellow. So I've made it my business to find out what this is all about. I know what ranger did to your father. Adams told me all about it. And I'm for your father. Well, thank you. But he's going to get into serious trouble if we don't stop him. = but how can we? I haven't heard from him in two days. Well, ranger doesn't know that. Look. You come up to the office and tell ranger you expect your father to get in touch with you. I'll get him to promise not to prosecute your father and that he'll install that new system of his right away. = but would he do that? Well, he's got to do something. He's going crazy up there. I think he'd listen to a proposition like this right now because he said he wanted to talk to you. Oh, I'd like to believe you, Mr. Travers, but I can't trust anybody that comes from ranger. Well, if you'd think of me as just Jim Travers, it might help a little. All right, Mr. Travers. = Jim Travers. I'll get my wrap. You get a taxi, Jim. = did she call me Jim? = yeah. Oh, boy! Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy! Taxi, taxi, taxi! Hey, where you goin'? I think I ought to get in touch with my daughter. Hey, you can't do that! Why, they'll grab you sure. They'll trace the call. = but I'm afraid she'll be worried. It's only until tomorrow night. Now take my word for it, boss. I'm an old hand. You're hot and you gotta lay low. That's why I brung you here. Well, perhaps you know best, Louie. But we'll get hungry. = I'll fix that. Do you like salami? Here. Oh, boy, oh, boy! Roast beef sandwiches and coleslaw and coffee and sinkers. Now you grab a nap. I'll be right back. Hi, Louie. = hello. The kid wants to see you. Come on. I hope you've told miss Mallory everything we've been doing for her father up here. We've been protecting him. I haven't told the police about what he's been doing because I've been hoping he'd come to his senses. Now, I want you to tell him that if he will come to me and make a public statement through the newspapers, that he's the only man who could do this sort of thing, and that the ranger system is perfectly all right, then I'm perfectly willing to overlook all the things that he's been doing for the sake of our old friendship. You mean you won't have him arrested? Right. = I'm sure that's one of the points he'll demand. One of the points? What else does he want? He wants you to install his new system at once. Young lady, did you ever hear of a thing called blackmail? I thought you said Mr. Ranger wanted to talk to me. Miss Mallory, just a minute, please. I don't think you realize how difficult and expensive it would be to install this new system just now. I'm afraid it will be more expensive not to. Now, please, miss Mallory, just a minute. Sit down. What? It's okay, boss. This is fingers. He works for the kid, the biggest guy in the business. Ti fixed it. We're in! I might have known I couldn't trust you. It's like Louie says, the kid's willin' to do business with you. We just came down to help you out a little tonight. Then we'll go have a talk with him. Boys, go with Carl. The safe's in the backroom. = just a minute! You can't... Hey, where are you goin'? = I'm not a crook. I won't have anything to do with crooks. You won't? No, I... Don't be tough with him. Shut up! Go back and tell those guys to hurry up. Get my lawyer on the phone and ask him to come up here right away please. Mr. ranger. Mr. ranger. Excuse me. Yeah, what is it, Mike? We just had another night key entry. The caudet company jewelers on fourth Avenue. = is that all? No, they took about $100,000 worth of stuff this time. = a hundred thou... Did you hear that, miss Mallory? My father wouldn't do that! Are you sure they left a night key note? Yes, I'm sure. What did it say? Same old thing. "What I create, I can destroy.” All right, Mike. Get captain Wallace on the phone for me. Never mind that lawyer, I won't need him now. Well, young lady, you almost had me eating out of your hand, didn't you? But it's too late for contracts now. I'm going to turn this town upside down 'til I find Dave Mallory. And when I do, he's going up for 20 years. = sit down. Boss, that's him! That's the kid! Caudet"s jewelry store. We left a night key note, so we're in the clear. = fine. Take it in the shop and get to work on it. Kid, this is the guy, and this is how he does it. Not much to it, is there? You're a surprise to me, pop. I didn't expect a guy like you. He put up quite a squawk. He didn't want to come up with us. Well, pop, you got a great little gag here. Got a lot of laughs out of it. But I can really use it. Is there any reason why we shouldn't go together on this thing? Every reason in the world. T haven't been able to make petty Louie understand what I'm doing, but you seem to be a little more intelligent. I'm using that machine to break through the ranger system for purely personal reasons. Your personal reasons don't mean a thing to me. What'll it take to teach Carl to operate this thing? = t will not allow that machine to be used for criminal purposes! Isn't that clear? = sit down! Hey, lay off him. He's my pal. Why, you little... No, no, wait! Please, don't do that. Oh, my god. All right, fingers. Now, pop, is it clear to you that you're in a tough spot? It's just as tough as you want to make it. Now, look. I'm taking over that gag of yours and you with it. I'll treat you right. We'll clean up fast while it's hot, then I'll give you enough money to do anything you want the rest of your life. No, no, and you can't force me to do it. That machine of yours wouldn't do you much good at the bottom of the east river, would it? Especially if it's in your pocket? You don't give me much choice, do you? = no. Why should I? I see, I thought you would. Here. Petty Louie told me you wouldn't be much good without those. Fingers. Show Mr. night key to the guest room. = come on. You too. Well, Louie, we're in. = Carl. Carll I want you to study this and find out what it's all about. Tomorrow night we'll try the old man. You'll stick close to him and watch everything he does. But you came here early tonight trying to make an agreement with Mr. ranger. How did you hope to contact your father then? You must know where he is. But, captain, I told you... Now wait a minute, Travers, please. Come on, tell us. Where's your father? = t don't know. Well, there's no use waiting for any more reports tonight. Mallory vanishes with daylight. Mr. ranger, you know that if a gang committed that robbery tonight, they must have forced him to do it. He's not a thief. If he were, he would have stolen before this, wouldn't he? It seems that way, doesn't it? Well, there's nothing more we can do here now. You don't want to hold miss Mallory any longer? No, no, she can go on home. Go ahead, miss Mallory. Thank you, Mr. ranger. = Travers! Just a moment, Joan. I'll be right with you. All right. It looks to me as though you were taking a personal interest in that girl. I think she's swell, and she's on the level. But you're working for me, you know. Yes, sir. All right, Travers, don't let that girl out of your sight. I'm holding you responsible. I'll take care of that, sir. Hmm, daylight. = yeah. I'll get a taxi and take you home. Seems silly. It's almost time for me to go to work. It's gonna be a tough day for you without any sleep. I'm awfully sorry. Oh, it wasn't your fault. If only I knew what had happened to dad or where he was. I wish I could suggest something to keep you from worrying. Oh, you're sweet. You're tired too. Me? I'm used to it. Oh. Look, I'll tell you what we'll do. We'll go up to the park and wake up the birds. The fresh air might do us both good. All right. Go ahead, go ahead. I'm watching you. Just in case. = in case of what? In case it doesn't work the way it should. It'll work all right. Seventy, huh? You can go ahead now. There it is, boss. They're inside. We'll give 'em a few minutes. Well, you know I could have had ranger's men here by now if I'd wanted to. Yes, I know. That's why I think I'd better take charge now. Is it safe, Carl? Yes. Come on, boys. All right, flatten out, both of you. = huh? Get down, get down. Stay down. Keep your eye on the door, Carl. I don't want any slipups with that gag. Okay, shoot. 657. Hurry up! Hello, Mike, what's up? I thought you were with the girl. She's working 'til midnight. Caillaux fur company, 611 west 41st street. = that sounds like that mob. I'm going with you. Why, this is off 70. Did you... Psst, psst. If you've done anything to... Boss, there's something wrong with this. He must have... Why, you- kid, we gotta get out of here. Come on! Pick that up! Keep it. Here they come! Hey, get that thing out of there! = get over to 49th. We'll head them off there. Right. Okay, come on. = sit down there! Now you're gonna get what's coming to you, you double-crossing old... Cut it out, fingers. I thought you wanted me to... I only did it now... = never mind. I lost my temper down there, pop. I'm sorry. You gonna fix that thing for me? = you know I'm not. The east river doesn't scare you, does it? = no. I haven't got so many years left anyhow. Not giving me much choice, are you? = no. I never met a guy just like you. Kid, if you'll just let me take him... Wait a minute, fingers. Pop's a great guy. Here. Take him to the other room and let him get a little rest. Can I have my glasses? I'll give 'em to you when you need 'em. You're not gonna let that old guy get away with it? Bring petty Louie in here. Ti wanna talk to him. = sure. Good night, sir. I just hate to do a dirty trick like this. You shut up and do as you're told. As soon as that mob gets away from the cage, we'll pay the little lady a visit. Okay. Hurry up with that soup. There's two things I can't stand. Hot soup and hot seats. Well, put some water in it. It's so weak now it must've been made outta jumping beans. Jumped in and out with one hop. = waitress. Check, please. Now listen, Louie. That's all. Oh, thank you. While I'm paying this check, you do the talkin'. Okay. Come on, let's go. But I ain't finished me soup! Well, pour it in your pocket, stupid! = Louie! Yeah, it's me. Tell me, where's my father? = shh! He's okay. And he wants to see you, so come along with us and don't say nothin'. But I can't go now. Then you don't see him. But I've gotta turn in my cash. = you heard what I said. Come on, Louie. = wait a minute. All right, sister, get in. Where are we going? Never mind that, just get in. Hey, pardon me. Could you tell me where the cashier is, miss Mallory? Why, I don't know. She should be right here. Oh, bea. Have you seen miss Mallory? Why, she just went out after a couple of men. I thought it was funny. - She just went out? - Couple of men? Who were they? Well, I don't know. They were talking at the desk, and then she ran out after them. Why, she's not supposed to do a thing like that. Ti don't understand it. = would this be her last check? Yes, sir. Where is table 14, waitress number two? She's right over there. Bea, will you show the gentleman, please? - Yes, sure. - Thank you. Oh, Molly, this guy wants to ask you a few... Did you make out this check? Yeah, sure. Do you remember the fellas you served? = do I? The big guy gave me half a buck. And the little guy had a coat on him 18 sizes too big for him. Yeah? Big fella called him Louie, I think. Petty Louie. = huh? Nothing. A, b, c, d, e. Was there any more to that? Do you think I got nothing else to do but read what dopes write on tables? Yeah, but do you remember if anything else came after that? A, b, c, d, e doesn't make sense. Maybe he was practicing his alphabet. It looked like it wouldn't hurt him any. Yeah, but it wasn't just f, g, h, I... = I, j, k, I, m, n, I haven't done this in years. P, q, r... Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. A, b, c, d, e. Petty Louie doesn't write on tables just for the fun of it. Well, you know him better than I do. A, b, c, d, e... F, g hi j k... Hello, pop. Come on over here and sit down. There you are. How are you feeling now? Any better? Did you bring me in to ask me that? No, I just thought you might see things in a different light. Here, put these on. = Joan! = dad! What have they done to you? Are you all right? They made me bring her, boss. Ti didn't wanna do it. Shut up. Oh, my dear, my... Oh, you vicious... She's just come here to watch you fix that machine of yours. If you do, I promise you she'll be treated courteously, and I'll take her out of here in perfect safety. If you don't, I don't promise anything. Dad, I didn't realize that I was... No, no. All right, I'll fix it. = fine. Now, pop, we're through playing games. I think Carl here has all the equipment you need. If there's anything else you want, just say so. I shall need Louie to help me. = sure. Go ahead, Louie. = t shall need some more of this wire. = yeah. You know, I tried to break down that ranger system with long wave and low frequency. Didn't get anywhere. Never thought of shortwave. Hmph! I'll have to send down to the storeroom for that wire. Now, this is exactly 52 turns, isn't it? Yes. Just to make sure that it'll still be 52 turns the exact number is very important, isn't it? Low frequency is no good against the ranger system, but it'll open a lot of doors. Oh, did you manage to get a little of the other wire? Good. Now, you know where I want it. = sure. I'm depending on you. I don't see how you can, boss, after the spot I put you in. Well, I do. You're aces, boss. It's in the bag. Hey, steady. That wire will be here presently. When can this be tested? It will be ready tonight as I promised you. I've been trying to get hold of you all afternoon. Where have you been? = down at the bureau of identification with a waitress from the restaurant. She identified petty Louie all right, but we can't seem to get a line on the other one. I told you I'd turned that over to the police department. Your job's up here in this office. Mr. ranger, I feel responsible for miss Mallory. And besides... Now, ho's paying you your salary? You are. - All right. - Now, wait a minute. Let's say you were. Oh, so that's the way you feel about it, eh? Yes, sir. Well, that's all right with me. Have you turned in a report on that holdup last night? No, sir. Well, do it. Then turn in your badge and your uniform. You're through. Well, Mike, will you write out the report while I'm changing? I'll sign it on my way out. Oh, sure. = thanks. = all set? Think you can work it now? = sure. All right, let's get going. Get six men and the big car. Right. You and the rest of the boys wait upstairs til' we get back. There are about a half-dozen joints in this town I'm interested in. Maybe I can crack 'em all in one night if this thing works without sending in an alarm. Not even a delayed one. All you have to do is close the door before you take this away. And then the contact can't be broken. I get it. Come on, miss Mallory. It looks like a large evening. = just a minute. You promised to let my girl go if I... She's going, isn't she? Well, not with you. = nol! Take it easy, pop. Here, I'll let you carry these. There's an off chance you may need 'em some time if everything works out all right. But you're not going to... = never mind. Now, pop, you double-crossed me once. If you've done it again, she's going to be sitting right in the seat beside me. Come on. = nol! - Wait a minute, dad! - No, no, Joan, Joan! Come on, now listen, boss. That won't do you no good. But I've gotta stop her. = it's too late for that now. If we're gonna help her, we gotta get out of here. You had the idea. You know, the wire! Yes, Louie, you're right. But I can't. Now, that's all right. I'll do the lookin' for you. Just tell me what you want. First of all, I need a long stick. What, like the broomstick? Yes. And a piece of metal to fasten on the end of it. It's in the bag. We were driving fast down 23rd street, west of 6th Avenue. Got it finished, Mike? I never made out any of these reports before, Jim. Just tell them what happened, that's all. Oh, all right. When a Van backed out of an alley and blocked us. Right? = yeah. = what kind of a Van? A regular Van. Don't you know what... A big Van, don't you? Oh, all right. What kind of a Van? It was some moving company, wasn't it? That's right. Abc delivery company. Yeah, that's right. Ti remember. Then we had to drive way around the other side. Mike, I've got it, I've got it! Look at that. A, b, c, d, e. You get it? - Yeah. - That's it, Mike. I'm going down there. I'm going with you. No, no. You stick right here by that telephone and don't you move. If you don't hear from me within 30 minutes, you grab the guys and come down after me. Are the dials on 30, Louie? Yes, boss. Are you sure you fixed this wire properly? Just like you told me. All right, I'm ready. Now, fingers first, and then the guys in the warehouse. Right. He's just where we want him! Hi, little lord fauntleroy. = huh? = uh-huh. = go on back in there and sit down. What's the matter with you? =t don't wanna. = you what? =t don't wanna. Why, you... Okay, boss! How do you like it, ey? It worked, boss! It worked! Hurry up. Shall I call 'em now, boss? Yes. Hey, you bums! Come in here, come on! Hurry up. What do you want? It's fingers, look at him. What's the matter, fingers? He's being electrocuted. Don't touch him. - Get him! - What? = get him! Get him! Gee, boss, that was great. You knocked those guys silly! Can you imagine... Get away from that door. Let's get to that elevator. Throw your arm around me. We'll get there. Let's go. Oh. Yeah, turn to your left. Now, wait, turn right. Now, straight ahead. That's fine. That's perfect! Now watch your step. Yes, but you do move furniture, don't you? Certainly we move furniture. But I'm telling you, all our vans are busy. Well, that's all right. I'm not in any hurry. In a couple of days will do. All right. What do ya got? = huh? = furniture! What do you want moved? Oh, oh, yes. Dining room suite. Listen, boss. When you get out of the elevator, turn to the right until you get to the wall. Then follow the wall 'til you get to the door. See? But, Louie, what are you talking about? I'm not gonna leave you. Don't wait for me, boss. Promise me that. Don't wait for me. = Louie! Remember, I can't promise this "til next week. Well, that's all right. Listen, buddy, I'm pretty busy. You'd better get out of here. Hey, what's going on here? All right, buddy, back up! Now be good, stay there! Mr. Mallory, where's Joan? Is she safe? Joan, who are you? =I'm Jim Travers of the rps. I'm her friend and yours. I've come down here to help you, where is she? She's gone, they've taken her with them. What? Well, I can stop them if you'll get me out of here. Well, come on. = we can't leave Louie. Help me with him. I'm sorry. I'm afraid it's too late to do anything about him now. = no. Well that's all right, we'll come back for him later. Come on, we've got to get out of here. Ranger! Would you put every man you can spare on it right away. I'll be down as soon as I can. What is it, another one? Yes, ormond's wholesale place. Is that one of yours? Yes. = blew the safe and killed the watchman. What? And no alarm came in on the big board? No, sir. Now, listen, Steve. This seems to be a systematic raid of the city. Every call is coming from a different section, and every one is from a firm that's supposed to be under your protection! Now, we're doing all we can. I we've got squad cars all over town. But you've got to fix that board! I know, I know. Adams! Where's Adams? Get Adams and tell him to come up here and check this board right away. Yes, sir, but I did tell him, sir. Don't argue with me! Get him up here! I just checked the board, sir. Everything seems all right, but we haven't had an alarm all evening. All right. They must have found some way of closing that circuit. At least we used to get the alarm after they'd finished. Hello! Ti want Adams! Well, find him! Find him and tell him to come up here right away! The whole thing's dead. Shut off those alarm bells! = it's the main cables. = get down in the cable room. Yes, sir. Hold it, boys. I want to see Mr. ranger. Mr. ranger. What are you doing here? We came up through the cable rooms. I've got Mr. Mallory here. Mallory? Yes, and you've got to listen to him! Why, Mallory... = let him talk! Listen, Steve, what I... =t don't wanna hear it! Now you listen to me! The whole of the city is at the mercy of a gang of criminals headed by a man who calls himself "the kid." And I'm the only one who can find him for you. Where? =t don't know where he is. But he's using my key, the one that breaks through this system. You're going to stop him by leaving the city wide open without protection? Yes. = it's insane. Now, wait a minute, Steve. How are you gonna do this? Are all the lights on? Of course they are! What have you done to this board? Answer me! I've put it in reverse. = in reverse”? Yes, don't you understand? Now when he uses my key, instead of stopping an alarm, he'll create one. How? A light will go out. Does that make sense to you, Steve? Well, it's possible. If it isn't another one of his tricks. That gang have got my daughter Joan with them. Your daughter? Stop talking! Watch those lights! There, there it is. 577! Quiet, quiet! All right, boys. Sharper, go all the way through and watch the front door. Get in the car and keep the motor running. Ajax importing company, 122 Doyle street. Call police headquarters. Squad cars immediately. I'll take charge of this for you, Mr. ranger. Now, look. I know that layout. The vaults are in the cellar. I'll go to the front door, you go to the back. Come on, ranger. All right, boys. = Travers! Ajax importing company, 122 Doyle street, 122 Doyle street. Go to ajax importing company, 122 Doyle street. Take him, boys. Get in there, Mike. = come on. Joan, where are you? Here, here she is. Take care of her. = Joan. Oh, my darling. Dad. Here he is! Here he is! Jimmy's in there! He'll be all right, dear. Don't worry. Right over here. Here. What is it? What's happened? Well, I'll be. I don't know how you got here, pop, but sit right where you are, both of you. I can see everything you do in this mirror. Come on, ed, get him. Better start praying those cops don't get any closer, because if they do, we're heading for the east river, and it'll be curtains for the three of us, get me? Come on, step on it, ed. He's getting away from us! =-tl'm down to the boards! Do you want your glasses? = no. Come on, ed! Tell me when the right-hand dial is on 40. Now. = give me that! There he is, captain. Oh, the kid, huh? All right, boys, take him away. Mallory, I'm sorry. I'm afraid you'll have to come along too. Six counts of illegal entry, you know. If you will leave Mr. Mallory in my custody, I'll be responsible for him and go his bail. Okay, Steve. But when I want him, you bring him down. All right. All right, boys, get these cars out of here. Come on now. Well, Dave, I'm going to put in your new system. You made me like it. In that case, I won't need this anymore. Oh, Joan.
