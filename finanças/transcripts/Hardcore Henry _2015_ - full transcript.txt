Well, it isn't normal, but it's only temporary, okay? Do you remember how you got here? That's fine. That's normal, too. Henry, wait. Wait. We'll get there. Scan. (MECHANICAL WHIRRING) SCANNER: Sensory processor activated. ESTELLE: Relax, okay? Scanning. Video link confirmed. ESTELLE: Up. (WHIRRING CONTINUES) This next part might hurt. Maybe quite a lot. But it won't last long, I promise. (CLICKING) Almost there. Welder. (WHIRRING) (MACHINE BEEPING) (WHIRS) You can do it. Wonderful, Henry. Squeeze. (ARM WHIRS SLOWLY) Harder. (ESTELLE SCREAMS AND GIGGLES) Cool, right? Integument? (WHIRRING) (BEEPS AND WHIRS) Please don't move your hand. You probably don't recall. But you were never a big fan of my work. Maybe this will change your mind. Right? Memory's a funny thing. I'm an expert and I don't know if you'll ever get yours back. You don't remember me at all, do you, Henry? My name is Estelle. You and I were... (MACHINE BEEPS) We still are... (WHIRRING) Husband and wife. I love you, Henry. I can't wait to hear you say it. (DOOR BEEPS) (ELECTRIC GUITAR PLAYING LOUDLY) (STOPS) Henry. His memories are still catching up with him. Oh, Jesus. I'm Robbie. The sorcerer of sound. You are gonna love this. Because, sir, you're gonna get to pick your own voice. (IMITATING ELVIS) Thank you. Thank you very much. (MACHINE BEEPS) (IMITATES LOUIS ARMSTRONG) Hello, Henry. Robbie. Oh, come on, they're options. What white guy wouldn't wanna sound like Louis Armstrong? Just one more. Quick.

No. Don't look at me like that, Henry. Your girlfriend here might have rebuilt you, but I gave her the raw materials to work with. And I mean really, really raw materials. (WHIMPERING) What's your name? Timothy. Nice to meet you, Timothy. Did you see Henry when Estelle brought his remains here? Yeah. Would you please be so kind to describe them to better Henry's understanding of how good he looks now? Sure. His arm was shot off below the... Below the elbow and the... The leg shot off below the knee. And there was a football-sized dent... Did you happen to see his head? Yes. Do tell. Um, the skull was dented in and there was this... His eyes were missing and, um, the bottom half of his jaw was shred to pieces. (KNIFE CLICKS) Just about right. (GROANING) What? (SCREAMS) (GASPING) (ESTELLE WHIMPERING) Shh... I'm bleeding, too.

Next, I need you to take your shirt off, please. Open up there. Yeah, those. Plug the jacks in there. Yeah, in there. So, your name's Henry and... Okay, well, the good news is that you're gonna live a while. The bad news is that in this case, a while means 20, 30 minutes tops, Henry. Unless you're very, very lucky. (BEEPING) Which you are.

Slick handles all Akan's cops/guns/real estate/ a lot of other shit. This helpful dot on the map is Slick's place. All you gotta do is break in there, kill him, open up his rib cage, take out his beating heart, and fucking eat it. (CHUCKLES) I'm kidding! I'm kidding. You don't have to fucking eat his heart.

(WOMAN LAUGHS) Hey. He's awake. Your eyes might be a bit blurry. It's just your depth perception trying to calibrate, yeah? Follow me as I walk, yeah? Get up. Okay. All right. Now...

Thank you, sir. I've lobotomized everything not essential... (CORK POPS) Not essential to soldiers. Personal memories, speech, sense of taste. It's all gone. Might still have a bit of an issue with emotional motivation, which... Motivation? Try your fucking paycheck, James. My... Yes, okay. (THUDS) AKAN: What the shit-fuck, James? I'm sorry, sir! I'm so sorry! Oh, shit! Open the doors! Please! Open the door! We've got a malfunction! Let me out, please! (BANGING ON DOOR) Sir, I'll fix it. I doubt it. (JIMMY SCREAMS) Fucking idiot. (GROANING) (JIMMY GASPS) You know, Jimmy, something about a spine snapping (BONES CRACKING) never gets old. (GLASS SHATTERS) It sounds like... The end, the beginning? Or are they the same? Have a seat, Henry. When a man is first crippled, there's always one question on everyone's mind, especially his. Does his dick work? Mine didn't, so I plotted my escape from this chair. I had come to Russia when the west banned resuscitation of cadaver tissue. Akan's a megalomaniac, but my research was funded. I kept my eyes on the Nobel Prize. Who has time for icky ethics when he's rich and his cock works, eh? (GUNSHOT ON TV) I paid a high price. I stopped making soldiers and then I succeeded. I grew men made of cyberflesh. Really, they're just fancy-pants prostheses, but don't dare tell... My avatars! Now, cyborgs, on the other hand, have bits and a brain. They think for themselves, in theory at least. Shall we have a look at you? (ZIPPER OPENS) (SNIFFING) That hippie, always with the ganja. You're not baked, are you? Hope not. All right. (WHISTLES) You are the man, Henry. Hmm. There's very little actual man left, of course. Enhanced skeletal muscular systems, cardiovascular turbo boosted with a curium-244 atomic battery. A good night's sleep and you'd power an aircraft carrier. Remarkable technology, is it not? Not you. My boys. I made the first few for revenge but then I started exploring new aspects of myself. Can I have a sip? Mmm. I have lived these past years, Henry. My lads, they get speeding tickets, they walk barefoot through the grass, and boy, do they get laid. You'll never guess what we do here sometimes alone. Hit play. Over there. Go on. (JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING) I've got you Under my skin I've got you deep In the heart of me So deep in my heart That you're really A part of me I've got you Under my skin I'd tried so Not to give in I said to myself "This affair never Will go so well" But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know so well I've got you under my skin? (WARNING ALARM BEEPS) What is all this? Close your eyes. Close your eyes. Something's wrong with you, mate. Don't worry, it's not the clap or nothing. Just gonna sit you down in this chair and take a look at you, yeah? The scan says you're in terrible danger. (LOCK CLICKS) Of being shivved for being a traitor, you lying grasser! I'm shutting you down, mate. (GROANS) (HENRY SNORTS AND SPITS) (GRUNTING) (GROANING) (RUMBLING) Put down the proto baby. (BABY WHEEZING) Now! We tried to unplug you nicely even though we knew that you beamed your video to Akan. No? What's this? (ECHOING) What's that? You're broadcasting that to Akan! Enough! Enough. Even if I did believe you, I still have to... (WARNING ALARM BLARES) (GROANS) Fuck! Henry, no! No! (SCREAMS) You brought them to my lab! I trusted you! Henry, please kill me. Akan won't. He'll make me live in this straightjacket of rotten, smelly skin! What the fuck was I thinking that Akan's toy robot was my friend? (BREATHING HEAVILY) Thank you, Henry. Fuck you, too, but mostly thanks. My lab's compromised, but I can build a new one using Akan's equipment when we go get your wife together, right? Hey, put that on the wall. If I can't have my lab, no one's having her. Now, don't lose this. Fuck you, Akan. And don't change your channel. We're coming right over. All right, I counted six vehicles. That's at least 35 men. We've gotta cut them down to half that before they enter the hotel to give us a fighting chance to get out alive. Also, there's a certain stigma attached to blokes who like musicals. I just wanna get it out there right now that I'm straight as an arrow. (VEHICLES APPROACHING) Got it? Here they come. Wait for it. Wait for it. (GUN COCKS) Now. (GUNSHOT) (INDISTINCT SHOUTING) Hey, cover me. (PUNK MUSIC PLAYING) (LAUGHING) Fuck, they're in the hotel. We don't need the sniper anymore either. Go inside. See the colonel. Over here, laddie. Arm yourself to the teeth. Don't touch that. Imogene's mine. That's what my father used to say. "A grenade a day keeps the enemy at bay." Come along. Chop-chop. Big Sally. (INDISTINCT SHOUTING) Eh... Well, home is where the battle is. Right, private, it is our duty to ensure that no harm comes to the cripple, understood? Follow on. If you can hear them, but you can't shoot them, you can probably grenade them. Drop an egg down there, laddie. (MAN SHOUTS INDISTINCTLY) Forward. Come along. Good Lord, how embarrassing. (GUNS FIRING) Dodged a bullet on that one. I'll cover you. You go around them. (GUNFIRE CONTINUES) JIMMY: Don't let the cripple get below you, laddie! (MAN SPEAKING RUSSIAN) (MAN SPEAKING RUSSIAN) (GRENADE EXPLODES) (GRENADE EXPLODES) (MAN SHOUTS) Jolly good. Pull your weight! Help me with the cripple. (MAN SHOUTS IN RUSSIAN) (WHISPERS) Retreat five paces back on my command, laddie. (MERCENARIES LAUGHING) Spasibo, Yuri. My quarters are actually up there. Would you like to see them? Oh, we will. Indeed. (BEEPS) (MEN SCREAMING IN PAIN) JIMMY: Don't spare the horses. You can take the next slipway. Off here. Here we go. (TIRES SCREECHING) (GUN FIRING) Down on anchors, laddie. Let's turn the tables on these buggers. Tally-ho. (TIRES SCREECH) Big Ben. Akan is a cunt. (DOOR SHUTS) Oh, my. Looks like Akan's already begun. By tomorrow, these poor chaps will be super robotic soldiers like yourself. Look out! (METAL SUIT CLANKS) (SCREAMS) (SHOUTING) JIMMY: On your feet, lad. (GUNSHOTS) On your left. Hang on. I'm gonna buy you some time! Seal the door. (JIMMY PANTING) Can't tell you the number of times I've dreamt that I was riding up in this lift. It's a pity I can't... It's just the landing gear, laddie. Now, listen to me. When you kill Akan, I want you to look him right in those eyes until the rest of him is just as dead as they are, understood? No, I'm afraid I shall not be coming with. But you letting me get you this far has given an old sweat his grandest gift in all his years. No. It's lodged in his jugular. If you uncork it, I won't be able to... (STUTTERS) The thingamajig in your pocket, quickly. Well, I have a confession to make. See, I've been surveilling Akan for years. So when you dropped down onto that roadway and went rogue so magnificently, well, all I saw was my shot at revenge. You proved me right with Dimitry, but then in the forest, well, I noticed an implant. A memory block, see? And I couldn't afford to have you remember a better life somewhere else. So I left it in. Not my finest hour, I'm afraid. But then, back at my lab while I was trying to analyze what you could do for me, I realized who you are to me. Henry. It's bloody nice having a friend, Henry. You'd think all those deaths would've prepared me for this. If you haven't already, you'll start to remember bits from your past now, Henry. And those memories, they're real. They're you. Trust them. (MUSIC PLAYING) (INDISTINCT SHOUTING) (GUNS FIRING) (MEN SHOUTING) AKAN: Memories, memories, memories. My first batch of cyber soldiers. With everything that you have experienced today uploaded into what's left of their brains, all they remember is waking up in the lab with their wife screwing their legs on. I love you, Charlie. I love you, Edward. I love you, Thomas. You recognize these? No? That's odd. They're your wife's. (SNIFFING) Mmm... I smell what you like about her. (BEEPING) This one is almost ready for you. But I'm warning you, their boosters make the one you have in you now... Look like a fucking 9-volt. Go ahead and fuck him up.

(THUDS) ESTELLE: Baby? Baby, are you okay? AKAN: I love how protective you are of me. Mmm... You owe me an apology. For? Doubting me. I did have certain apprehensions. Then why'd you let me do it? I was just entertaining my woman and losing all of my men. (GASPS) Is everybody dead? Yes. Yes. Do you know when I realized this was working? When? When Henry pulled me into the escape pod, trying to get me out of the lab no matter what. Who would've thought that pussy is a hell of a motivator? (SNIFFING) Ah. (CHUCKLES) We'll have a hundred of you tomorrow, a thousand next week. Each one's first memory will be his wife slipping a cheap brass ring on his finger. Every single one of my soldiers will wake willing to do anything my brilliant wife tells him, whether it's marching on Paris or the White House lawn. I would like to pretend you understand the part you played. You didn't make history, Henry. You helped end it. Mmm... (KISSES) (CHUCKLES) (CHOPPER BLADES WHIRRING) MAN: You little pussy. That's what my old man called me. It's like it was my name. And I proved him right by killing all the wrong people. I love you, Henry, and I'll never call you anything but your name, but you gotta decide. Are you gonna lay there, swallow that blood in your mouth?
