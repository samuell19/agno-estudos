Tell her we'll bring it as soon as we shave and dress. That's a dot... Dot... Dash-dash... Dash-dash... Dot-dot... Dot... Hey, cut it out, will you? Does my head look like a steam pipe? No, a steam pipe hasn't got ears! Besides, what are you beepin' about? All I did was hit you like this. It was harder than that. Well, at the most, it was only like this. It was much harder than that. I'll show you. See? [GASPING] Take it easy, kid. Hey, hey, hey. Break it up, you guys. We gotta go to work. Mary's waiti'' for breakfast. We gotta shave, and you guys are playing games. Shut up. [LAUGHS] Oh! Come on, you. [SINGING] Hike! Hike! MOE: Hike! [SNORTS] Right. Your face is too sharp. MOE: Hurry up with those hot towels. Hot towels, comin' up. Oh. Oh. Towel! Towel! Towel! Shampoo! Shampoo! Powder! Powder! Take a powder. Go on. Nice, beautiful talcum powder. Schlemiel number 8. [SNEEZES] Hey, hurry up with Mary's breakfast, you guys. Oh, I gotta have a mixing bowl. Ah. Let's see... Eh, too small. This'll do-- What stupid, imbecilic fool put that u--? I did. Oh, am I dumb. You lamebrain! Fried eggs? Mary likes 'em scrambled! I ought to mash you like a potato. Hey, Moe, where'd you get the sunglasses? I bought 'em. Get outta here and get busy. I'll take care of this. Let me see now. The coffee grinder. Yeah. There we are. Ah. The old lard. Ha, ha. Yes, sir. One... two... three... That's fine. Hen-fruit! Now I'll scrabble them. [SINGING] Go on, nitwit. Set that table up so Mary can have her breakfast. Hurry up. All right. [BABBLING] Go on. Get outta here. I'm goin', I'm goin'. Oh. Oh, yeah? Oh, gettin' to be a wise guy, huh? There you are. There you a-- [CHUCKLES] [BABBLING] [LAUGHING] Uh, you jockhead. What's the matter with you? This thing is haunted. Every time I lift the legs, they jump back. You're an imbecile. There's nothin' wrong with it, I'll show you. One, two, three, four. Now get this table set. Go on. Cut it out. Funny, you stay up for him. [YELLS] Oh. [SCREAMS] Oh, my finger! Where's my finger? Where's my finger?! Oh, there it is. Oh, a wise guy, eh? [BARKING] Remember, no tricks. Wait'll you see what we got for breakfast this morning. Nice cold hotcakes smothered in vinegar. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Come in. How do you do? I'm the new adjuster from the Calamity Insurance Company. How do you do? Oh, so you're the crook that's been holdin' out on this kid. Everybody knows that you owe her dough. Why don't you pay her? She's a cripple. Come on, now, start somethin'. Bop you, that's what I ought to do. Why, I'll give it to you good, boy. Shoot one that way. You know, I just-- Shoot one that way. Whoa, boy. What are you gonna do about it? Where is he? Oh. You're gettin' smart, eh? Oh, a little harder, eh? Oh, a wise guy. So you meant it, eh? [SCREAMS] Cut out this nonsense. Now, never mind that insurance crook, Mary. We got a job, we'll earn enough money for your operation and you'll walk again. We're working for the Garden theater, pasting up posters. And we better get to work before we get fired. Oh, you're in a hurry, eh? All right, open that door, mister! Get goin'. All right. [GRUNTS] Come on. [PIANO PLAYING] Why we have so many rehearsals, I don't know. The insurance companies are all alike. You don't tell me. They're liable. They're liable not to-- Oh. Don't get excited, miss. Wait a minute. There you are. There you are, toots. Good as new. Well, you eat it. Come on, Mary. Always causing trouble. Oh, shut up. Come on. [WHISTLING] Wow. We better change our clothes. [ALL GRUNTING] Which one of you slammed that door shut? Not me. Say, maybe a cyclone did it. Yeah, maybe it just blow shut like this. Yeah. Was it like that? Yeah, it was exactly like-- Ow! Hey, what's the idea? Come on, get dressed! All right, I'll get dressed. Wait a minute, wait-- There's no room for all-- [BABBLING] Now, behave yourself. Get dressed. Say, did you guys slam that door? Yeah. What about it? Nothing, you can slam it any time you like. [CHUCKLES] [SCREAMING, CRASHING] Come in. Hiya, boss. Hey, boss. Look at those headlines. "During daylight robbery, nets bandits $50,000. "Huge reward offered for captured gunmen. Police rounding up suspects." Hey, boss. I'm scared. That big fat cop got a good look at us as we made our getaway. Relax, we're in show business. No one would suspect the Great Svengarlic and his troop. Right, and we're all set to knock off the Gottrox Jewelry Company. In 15 minutes the Gottrox Company closes for lunch. I'll do my hypnotic act in front of the theater to attract the crowd and occupy the cops while you boys blow up the safe. Now, this is the plan. Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Why you... [BOTH GRUNTING] I hear bells. Jingle bells? Cowbells. Let's try for jingle bells. [BOTH GRUNTING] Still cowbells. I'll fix that. [JINGLING] I hear 'em, I hear 'em! Jingle bells, Jingle bells! Let's hurry and get these posters up. Yeah, we're late now. Hey, Larry. Did you-- Oh! What's the matter with you? Oh! What's the matter with me? Oh! What's goin' on? Why, you nitwit, you! Get busy or I'll pulverize you. Go on! All right! I'm the only guy that does anything around here. [GRUNTS] [GRUNTS] [MOE COUGHING] Why, you... You nitwit, you! What's the matter with you? Give me that brush. You're absolutely useless. Hey-- [BABBLES] I'm sorry, kid. Why don't you look what you're doin'? I said I'm sorry, so shut up! Go on, get that thing up or I'll knock your brains out! All right. Hurry up. Okay, don't be a-- Line 'er up! I got it... There we go. Okay. "Here this week, the Great Hypnotist Svengarlic. He'll steal your breath away." I tell you it's gonna work. All I need is someone to hypnotize. Hey. Hey, wait a minute. I got an idea. You? Yeah. Maybe we can get this Svengarlic to hypnotize Mary and make her walk. MOE: Ah, that hypnotism stuff is the bunk. I'll bet I can hypnotize you and make you do anything. For instance, look me in the eye. Hocus, pocus, pocus, hocus. Alacadabra. Tsk. Tsk. Tsk. You are now in New York. I am now in New York. You are now in Sing Sing. I am now in Sing Sing. You are now in Boston. I am now in Sing Sing. You can't get this guy outta Sing Sing. Good, that's just where he belongs. [CHUCKLES] [GRUNTS] "That's where he belongs", eh? I'll tear you limb-from-limb. Just what the doctor ordered. [STOOGES ARGUING] I'm sick and tired of this nonsense, so cut it out. I hope you numbskulls are convinced that this hypnotism is a fake. You are wrong, my friends. Look me in the eye, straight in the eye. In the eye. In the eye. MAN [ON PA]: Ladies and gentlemen, the Great Svengarlic will now demonstrate the most amazing manifestation of hypnotism ever performed. Watch that flagpole on the insurance building across the street. You are still under my spell. Come out. Come out. Walk out on the flagpole. Walk. Walk. Stop! You will now start dancing. Dance. Dance. Light it. SVENGARLIC: Dance. Dance. Dance. Dance. Dance. That's the way. Dance. Good grief! Svengarlic has been injured. Speak to me. Svengarlic, say somethin'. The boys are up on the flagpo-- The boys. Hey! What's that crowd doin' down there? [ALL MUMBLING] [SCREAMING] Let go of my legs! Let go of my legs! What do you think, I got wings? You don't let go, I'll hit you on the head with this flagpole! I'm slippin'! Shemp, hold still. I'll spit on my hands and get a new hold. I-- Whoa! No! [SCREAMING] [SCREAMING] Ah! Hey, Moe! What's goin' on? I feel a draft! Moe! Hey, Moe! Where are you? You're inside-out! [GROANING] Moe. Moe, don't move. [CHATTER] How you doin'? Okay. You up? Oh. Oh. [ALL MUMBLING] [SCREAMING] [EXPLOSION] Well, if it ain't the bank bandits. Bank bandits? They tried to kill us. You captured them, that's what counts. And the reward for these robbers is a real handsome one, I'll tell you. Come along, here. Did you hear that? Reward. Now Mary can have her operation. Let's go and tell her. Yeah. Good. Will she be happy to hear that. Oh! [GRUNTING] Doggone it! [ALL GRUNTING] [♪♪♪]
