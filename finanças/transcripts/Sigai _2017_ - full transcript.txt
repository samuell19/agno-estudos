No thanks What's the problem? Why can't it be like this? Since she didn't pick your calls, you went to where she was... and you could have killed the guy for intervening Later, you kidnapped Nimmi What do you mean? Confused? Your obsession for Nimmi might have forced to you to go to Anna Nagar You could have forced Nimmi to come with you The guy who booked her wouldn't have been a mute spectator He definitely would have intervened and that would have lead to a fight You could have killed him and safeguarded Nimmi in a hideout I have come across many like you I speak the truth and you guys don't trust me? Just get out! Yes sir? Useless! I'll kill you! You promised me Nimmi! Isn't it? Yes That's the kind of girl I demanded Just a cigarette burn and she bites me!
