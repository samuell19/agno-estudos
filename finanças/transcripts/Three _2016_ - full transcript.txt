SURGERY IS IN PROGRESS DO NOT ENTER Periosteal elevator. Water. More pressure. Lights out, microscope in. Mr. Chung, 73 years old. He's a psychiatric inpatient. He fell down in the hospital and suffered from syncope, a head injury. We ran a quick CT scan, and found an intradural hematoma in the left brain with mass effects and a midline shift. We did a craniotomy. Today is day five, post-op. Limbs are normal. He will be discharged after the stitches come off. Did we do a post-op CT scan? Yes, on day one. There's a contusion in the left temporal lobe. Scan him again before he leaves. Okay. Enjoy the food. Can we move him over to Recovery? Where is he on the waiting list? He's number four on the list. He still needs to wait. Mr. Hung, 27 years old. Five weeks ago, he came in because his legs were weak and his hands exhibited signs of paralysis. The MRI shows an extensive cervical spinal cord tumor. We did a laminectomy for subtotal excision... You. Weren't you so confident? You said that I'll be fine when you were coaxing me into having the surgery. Surgeries involve risks. The doctor had studied your condition and made the call. Shall we continue? What did the intra-op frozen section show? Was the section cleared? Somewhat, but it was inconclusive. I felt that it was operable. Have you considered closing it after the biopsy, and use radiotherapy afterward? Radiotherapy can only slow down the tumor's development. But the symptoms have popped up. His quality of life would be compromised. It would only get worse. He's young. The surgery gives him a better chance to live a normal life. Normal life? I can't move! I'm paralyzed! It's only been three weeks since the surgery. In some cases, it takes at least three to four months, or even up to six months to see any improvement. How is he doing in his physiotherapy? We want to build up his trunk muscles, to help him sit better. But his morale is poor. He won't even try. There's still hope. It won't be easy, but... We understand what you must be feeling. But please show some respect. Useless doctor! It's all your fault! Calm down! She doesn't want to see you like this either. She's equally upset, you know? I could have played it safe. But that wouldn't have solved the problem. I took a chance for your own good. Next. Excuse me! How many thugs got away? Excuse me. Did the operation fail? Excuse me! Police! Get out of the way! A 228. Category two. - Dr. Shek. - Yes. - Officer, please remove the handcuffs. - Okay. Transfer him. Sir, what's your name? What's your name? How did you get hurt? He was shot. Send him to Resuscitation. Does it hurt? Does it hurt? - Legs are fine. - BP and pulse? BP 136/80, pulse 76. Shan, set up the drip. - Get ready to turn him over. - Neurology. Gunshot wound to the head. GCS ten. - We're ready. Check his head. - Okay. Ready? One, two, three. There's only one wound on the right temporal lobe. Do a CT scan first. Move. A fat woman asked a doctor on how to lose some weight. The doctor suggested horse riding. A week later, 100 pounds disappeared from the horse. I'm fine. You're considered very capable. You're already an associate consultant at such a young age. It was just a case of bad luck with this patient. I don't believe in luck! I came to Hong Kong when I was 17. I learned Cantonese and English, got into medical school, and became a neurosurgeon to get where I am right now. None of it had anything to do with luck. I know that you work hard. Just take it easy. Lives are in our hands. It's a matter of life and death. We're professionals, but not everything is within our control. We can only do our best. People say that all the time. But they don't even know what it means. I have patients waiting for me. GCS and pupils normal. - Show me the scan. - Okay. The CT scan shows a foreign body in the left frontal lobe. According to Dr. Chow's notes and what the scan reveals, this is probably a bullet. There are fractures near the entry site and some soft tissue swelling here. And over here. It shows that there are hemorrhaging and edema along the bullet path. Lucky him. There isn't any significant hydrocephalus or midline shift. Wow, he can survive such a wound. What a lucky devil! At 11 a.m., the police captured the suspects in Kwun Tong and shots were fired. The image shows the inspector who shot at them leaving the scene. During the operation, a suspect was injured and sent to Victoria Hospital for treatment. It is believed that the suspect was involved in an armed robbery last month. The robbery happened on the third of last month. - Miss, no photos, please. - The public has the right to know. Please, don't push. Step back. No more freedom of the press in Hong Kong? No photography! - It's too crowded. - Take the next one. HN 157399034. ID UJ8742387. What is the operation? We have the consent of two medical officers. They've signed it. - The patient from Ward C5 is here. - Okay. Excuse me. Ward one, come get the patient. We're putting you under now. Take a deep breath and try to relax. Sir, take a deep breath. Why did you let them in? They insisted on watching. I don't want anyone interfering. Take a deep breath. Remove his handcuffs and get out. I must keep an eye on him. He's a killer. He's under anesthesia. Remove the handcuffs. Get out. Sir, you can't do this. Sir, you can't do this. Don't give us a hard time. Sir, you can't go in there. Sir, please come out. I don't want surgery. Sorry. You need to move to the hallway and make room for the other patients. You've been here for six months. The doctor says that you're fine. Don't occupy the bed. Don't look back! It's bad luck! I bought food for everyone. They haven't had lunch. We don't know how long the surgery will take. Nonsense. Throw it away. Fatty. Go. You're lucky. The bullet went into your head, but didn't do any critical damage. Your bodily functions will not be affected. But the bullet is a foreign body. If we don't remove it, it may cause hemorrhaging, pus, and infection. It might kill you. SIG P250, 9mm Parabellum, hollow point. Non-penetrating, but destructive. I should be a dead man. How could I have survived? How could I have survived? The next six hours are critical. Your condition may deteriorate suddenly. By then, it will be too late to operate. I suggest that you do it now. There was a chicken on a farm. Every morning, the farmer would feed it. The farmer fed it since it was a chick, until it grew into a big, fat chicken. The chicken thought that the farmer was a good man. One morning, the farmer came as usual. But he didn't feed it. He killed it. Because it was Thanksgiving! The chicken believed in an assumption. As a result, it died. I didn't make that story up. A philosopher called Bertrand Russell wrote it in his 1917 book, Problems of Philosophy. As a doctor, it's my responsibility to inform you. But it's your call. Think it over. Hey! Are we having chicken tonight? - No! - Russian chicken? - No! - Gourd tonight? No! No? Then, I'm dead. I'll sue you! I will definitely sue you! I'll sue you! - I'll sue you! - Quiet down. What happened? Settle down. Take it easy. This is not good for you. What are you doing? Why did you draw the curtains? We need to question him. Why'd you need to draw the curtains for that? I'm sorry. When a patient is under observation, it means that the nurse must be able to see him at all times. Understood, I'm sorry. I have something important to ask him. Like what? His condition isn't stable. You can't use his statement in court. Is this your first day on the job? I'm not taking his statement. His accomplices are on the loose, and they are dangerous. I'm just doing my job. Thank you, doctor. It's called stress. Greece is the least happy place, followed by Iraq, then Bulgaria. Hong Kong scores 6.4 on the happiness index, it's fourth from the bottom. She's probably having her period. Where are your buddies? Don't you remember? Your colleague put a gun to my head, but I still don't know. I really don't know. So, did the gun went off accidentally? Don't you remember? You resisted arrest, seized a gun, and assaulted an officer. My partner shot you in self-defense. The judge tends to believe the cop. Want some? I do! I do! Why don't you want surgery? Planning an escape? Waiting for your buddies to save you? I don't drink. Cops are always covering up for each other. We've gone our separate ways. Without me, each of them gets a bigger share. You've been a cop long enough. Since when do criminals love their pals more than money? You're right. So, there was a chicken on a farm. Russell's chicken only believed in an assumption. As a result, it died. Of course, we'll die without food. Russian chicken. The nurse said that we are having chicken for dinner. Eat something. Thank you for your cooperation. You'll fucking die if you fuck with me. Doctor! Come here. I want to make a phone call. What do you want? According to Article 8, Your Rights, of the Notice to Persons Under Investigation by, or Detained in the Custody of the Police, I have the right to call, email, or fax my friends or relatives. If the police think that, it might interfere with the investigation, or pervert the course of justice, we have the right to refuse your request. You know the rules better than I do. I wanted to ask a friend whether I should have the surgery or not. He really needs it. I can make the call for you. It's 63730639. There's no answer. Then forget it. Sir, when will you call again? I know what to do. It's not my first day on the job! Take this back to the station. We're running out of time. Ballistics is already on the case. Check it out, and then get back here. If we don't do something, Sun is screwed. Unauthorized use of a firearm is illegal. So is the obstruction of justice. Whether he was reckless or stupid, he wanted to arrest the perpetrator and enforce the law. We break the law to enforce the law. Let's go. Let's give you a haircut. Thanks. Are you thirsty? Do you want some water? Fine. Where are you going? There's no water left. I'm not thirsty. Read your book. But you said, "Fine." That means that I'm not thirsty. Whatever. Where are you going now? I want to get you a surgical gown. Do you know where it is? Let the nurse get it. Sit down and read your book. I'll get it later. Thank you. Where are you going now? I'm going to wet the towel to clean your hair. Just give it to me! - Give it to me! - Here. Sit down and stop running around. Okay. Kill the music. Securing the patient's head. We're all set. This number is from the suspect. I'll pass it over to the CIB. The guy in black with a bag. Keep an eye on him. The guy in black with a bag in the lobby, keep an eye on him. How long has that van been there? Check it out. Bosco, the gray van in the back. Right hand, bipolar. Left hand, M6. Yes. The aneurysm is lower than that shown on the image. We don't have proximal control. I can do it. - Be careful with the neck. - I know. Sugita 9mm straight clip. The patient is coughing. Got it. An aneurysm rupture. More suction. I'll go change and help you. - Remove the clip applier. - Gauze. - Gauze. - Gauze. BP is dropping, 88/63, pulse 120! Give me four blood packs. Have you maximized the suction? On both machines. - I still can't see. More suction. - Okay. Lower and deeper. Alex, press the carotid artery. The aneurysm is ruptured. A hole in the ICA. I want to trap the ICA. There's not enough room for trapping. BP 71/53, pulse 134. The patient will die. Sugita 10mm. Straight clip. BP is still dropping, 63/40, pulse 145. We can't stop the bleeding. He will die. Close it. I'll do it. Microscope out, lights in. After we opened him up, we realized that the aneurysm is lower than that shown on the CT scan. We tried to trap it, but the aneurysm ruptured. He scores three on the GCS. His pupils are dilated. His pupils are dilated? GCS three? What does that mean? The Glasgow Coma Scale is a measurement used to assess one's state of consciousness. GCS15 is the highest score for normal people like us. GCS three is the lowest. Just give it to me straight. He won't wake up. We tried to stop the bleeding. But we failed. It was unsuccessful. Be prepared with the possibility that he probably won't make it. I see. My husband doesn't like me running around. Thank you, doctors, for trying. Go home and get some rest. Why? Is it my problem? Was it my fault? I have a conference in Guangzhou. - We'll talk tomorrow when I get back. - About what? Was it my fault? My problem? Yes! You're pushing yourself too hard. You went into surgery even when you were out of form. Do you consider yourself a responsible doctor? Get some rest. I have no teeth. Help me out, pal. I don't have the keys. Help me out, pal. Nurse, untie me. I need to pee. Pee in your diaper. I'm not a baby. Hello? How was it? Have you finished studying for tomorrow's test? What is four times six? Five times seven? Eight times nine? Good girl. Put mom on. It's a phantom number. No phone log. The Tsim Sha Tsui station detected its signal. CIB told me that calls must be made in order to locate it. Inspector Ken is calling now. Hello? Is this the owner of the number 63730639? Yes, what's up? We're calling from Dragon New Bank. Do you have any mortgages or unpaid credit card payments? We're doing a promotion. Easy loan, low interest and no handling fee. - The maximum amount... - I can rob someone if I need money. Inspector, let me talk to my friend. Okay, please wait. Wait for what? For you to trace my call? Don't bother. I'm at Crown Jewelry on Canton Road. This is a robbery! Call Control, send in the EU. In ancient Greece, people already noticed that whales would strand themselves along the coast in a mass suicide. Former Soviet scientist, Tomilin, believed that whales rush to the rescue of their own kind, just like soldiers deployed on a rescue mission. As a result, when one whale is stranded, the whole flock dies. Shut up. Grade two multiplication table, seven years old. You have a wife and a young daughter. Is your partner worth saving? Have you thought it through? Look at me! Look at me! Tragic! Seizure in bed number four. - Give me a hand! - Yes. Calling Dr. Tong. Remove the handcuffs. Remove the handcuffs! Speak. - The suspect is having a seizure. - Shit. Give him oxygen. Relax. Go over there. Don't let him hurt himself. Ward manager, Dr. Tong has called back. The patient in bed number four. Gunshot wound to the head. Seizure. GTC. BP 180/112, pulse 132. When did it start? At 3:34 p.m. Five milligrams, Valium IVI, stat. I'm leaving. Let Steven follow up. Call me if there's any problem. Sir, we're giving you an injection. You will feel better. Relax. That's it. Relax. I'm fine. An armed robbery on Canton Road, in Tsim Sha Tsui. Armed men in masks barged into a jewelry shop. Jewelry worth 15 million dollars. Police exchanged shots with the robbers, and over 20 rounds were fired. But the robbers got away. Some officers were sent to the hospital due to injuries and trauma. Police just released the CCTV footage from the jewelry shop. We can see - How do you feel? - at least three robbers... You had a seizure, so we did a CT scan. There's still some hemorrhaging. It's very serious. Do you understand? Understand? Will I have another seizure? You should be worried about that bullet in your head! Yes, we gave you some medication, but no one can guarantee that it won't happen again. What's more important than your life? Trust me. Your operation will be successful. 63730639. Nobody answered! I'm glad that I didn't oversleep. Otherwise, I would have missed the action. The best is yet to come. Watch the 6:30 p.m. news. Where are they? 41.6 billion dollars was budgeted - for security from the year 2015 to 2016. - Where are they? - That's 9.4 percent of the expenses. - Where are they? Where are they? Find them yourself. That's your job. - Where are they? - Find them yourself. Where are those bastards? Where are those bastards? How can I tell you? Where are those bastards? - Don't fucking "sorry" me! - Officer, this is a hospital! - Done? - Yes. Who's in charge? Team B, Superintendent Wong. He wants to know when we can give a statement. Superintendent Wong! It's Ken! We're in big trouble. Did you watch the news? Yes, my boss just bit my head off. My team and I are exhausted. Exactly. We'll give you our statements later. I'm not playing hooky. My walkie-talkie needs some batteries. - What were you whistling? - What do you mean? - What song were you whistling? - I'm whistling... Did you hear it somewhere before? Where? I remember! Let me think. Stop. Play this. Stop. Next. We traced the call to Central. There are many jewelry shops there. The CIB is heading over there now. Why did they let us find them? They're playing with us. They're lunatics! Next. That one. No. This one. I remember! I remember the tune! But the monitor is blurry. He was wearing a suit! The man in a suit. He's in the lobby! Look, look No knife and fork for the steak Come eat with me Lots of tarts and cakes Eat until you're full Eat until you turn black Eat and lie on the bed Shit. No wonder. Where is it? Here it is. - What are you doing? - Charging my laptop. Not here. It will explode. Go away. - "It will explode"? - No charging is allowed here. Go away. You're so mean. Then where? Found it. There it is. Done. You pissed all over. Can't you smell it? Hey, can't you smell that? He reeks of urine. What's up? The tube came off. - Can't you see? - What's wrong? You're not doing your job. You should have told us. It stinks. Next time, please tell us. I'll change your pants in a minute. What now? Adopted by the World Medical Association in 1948, the Declaration of Geneva was based on the Hippocratic Oath. Don't you remember? Are you going to call or not? I'll do it if you won't. It's against the rules. We'll do it later! Still no answer? Do you trust the police? Do you trust the perpetrator? Got it. Someone called 63730639 from the hospital. Ward C Four. Hold on. Who called 63730639? -63730639 -Doctors are not God. Who made the call? - I did. - Line one. I'm a neurosurgeon from Victoria Hospital. Your friend wants to talk to you before his operation. Someone answered! Thank you, Doctor. Hello? How are you? You got shot? In the head, but I'm still alive and kicking. Do something for me. Yuen Kwok Sun, PC39633 shot me. Kill him. "And if a man cause a blemish in his neighbor; as he hath done, so shall it be done to him; Breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth. As he hath caused a blemish in a man, - so shall it be done to him again." - Call Sun. Tell him - not to leave the headquarters! - Leviticus 24. Hello? It's Tong. Has Sun given his statement? I'm off-duty. I'm leaving. How would I know? I'm not a cop! I really didn't know. I didn't. How would I know? I didn't! Saving the perpetrator will kill a cop. I'm not letting you off. You have to work with me. Drink some water. Let's talk. I need your help. Get someone to dress as the patient. The signal is near the headquarters. Should we go check? I smell trouble. - Big trouble. - If we do that, we're screwed. We'll only find a cell phone. I'm sure that they're here to bust him out during visiting hours. Let's go get them. A lawyer wants to see his client. Can you please check? We have church activities every Sunday. You're welcome to drop by. - Miss, do you believe in Jesus? - No, I don't. Join our activities every Sunday. One last time for bad luck. I'm back! Hey! You're back. You're still here? Look! Get up. Be careful. Sit down. Don't move. Watch the hand. Hands up. I told you not to move. Why tie my hands? Because you're naughty. Naughty? Don't tie me up. I must go to work. Work? You're always playing around. Yes, I'm playing around. Don't move. - Calm down, sir. - He cut the line. Please make way. Wait here. Follow me. He'll take over. Go find Inspector Chan. Guard here. Bed number four, add 100mg Dilantine. Where's the laptop? I want to check the CT scan again. Let him take over. - Stay alert. - Okay. Sir, what are you doing? Visiting hours will start soon. We don't want to disturb anyone. I spoke to Dr. Tong. Fatty, what's up? Sir? Doctor. - This may hurt. - It's too crowded. Get out! What the hell! GCS is down to three. Get ready to intubate. Call the operating room. We'll sign for his operation now. You saw that the patient was already unconscious! - Get out of my way! - Don't mess with me! Did you poison me? He made me. You swapped the bottles. We deal with evidence. Professional misconduct can get you suspended and give you a criminal charge. You don't know how bad your condition is. I did it to save you. Can't you tell what they're up to? That one. That one. And that one. Cops. Don't play games with me. More are coming. We must keep your friends entertained. I hope that they don't have any dinner plans. And you let him? People will die. She's with us now. Look, doctor! Someone hacked me and severed the tendon. Do you think that I can shoot with my right hand? I don't think so. The gun has been marked as evidence. It's too late now. Let me go and everyone lives. You can't fix it unless you realize that your anger comes from fear! According to an American psychologist, Stanton Selzer, the source of anger is the fear of losing control. Why am I always smiling? Because everything is under my control. That's why I'm happy. But your nose is bleeding. It's not the first time. Go stand guard outside. His tendon was severed. He said that he couldn't have shot with his right hand. I don't believe him! Don't take any risks. I'm about to retire. I turned in the gun. I'll take the blame. We're all in this together. Madam, losing the perpetrator is negligence of duty. But you'll go to jail for perjury. So, we give in to him? Kill him. But we're cops. Better him than us. Help! Calling Inspector Ken. Calling Inspector Ken. I need to use the toilet. To pee or to poo? Do you need a pan? Hell no! Wait a minute. Sir Ken, the suspect needs to use the toilet. Let him go. - Nurse, I want to eat. - Doctor! I'll call you back. Dr. Tong! Wait. Get down. Please wait outside. Print out his ECG. Wait, sir, who do you want to see? I'm a lawyer. I want to see my client. He's not allowed to have any visitors. Use your common sense. He has the right to see a lawyer. Even the brass can't say no! You do your job, I'll do mine. Let's not waste each other's time. Are you insane cutting your wrists? Don't you feel any pain? How is my husband? Doctor? Doctor! Please take a look at him. Calm down. What happened to bed number four? - Over there. - I want to eat! Nurse! Where's the patient? He went to the toilet. Inspector Chan, the lawyer demands to see his client. Don't touch me! Let me die! - Sir, calm down. - Let go of me! Let me die! Let me die! Let me die! What are you doing? Hold his hands. Wait, sir. It's all right. Take a look... It's going to explode again. Quick, run! Doctor, I can walk! The hematoma is so big that the brain stem has stopped working. The operation is likely to fail. Shall I do it? I understand. I'll try my best. Play the music and listen. He didn't shoot the officer. - I planted the gun. - What are you saying? I knew that his accomplices had plans. We interrogated him and beat him up. He was cocky and wouldn't budge. I told Sun to put a gun to his head. What are you talking about? I'm not here to take your statement. Sun thought that I told him to shoot. It was a mess then. - I can't remember if I said it. - They said the suspect wouldn't wake up. I thought that I was doing the right thing. I almost killed him. Leave him alone. He'll never wake up. They say that they're taking me somewhere else. I know that you like this. Take them all. You're welcome. Friends, you should all learn from me Everyone should laugh like me Everyone is happy Don't worry Everyone drinks Feeling rich and happy Let's celebrate our youth and beauty Wish your family is filled with laughter And good fortune Things turn out satisfactory And people become happy So, I'm not afraid of being called a fool
