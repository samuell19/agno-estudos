I HAD A POLACK FRIEND ONCE. SHE WAS INCREDIBLY STUPID. DON'T DO THIS, MA. JULIE KAPOWSKI. SHE WAS THE STUPIDEST WOMAN THAT I EVER KNEW. SHE BELIEVED THAT BLACK COWS-- HA HA HA HA! BLACK COWS SQUIRTED CHOCOLATE MILK. I THINK IT'S BETTER IF YOU AND DANNY HAVE DINNER ALONE. THERESA, WAIT. WHY DON'T YOU HAVE MY GRILLED CHICKEN? CUT IT UP IN SMALL PIECES AND DEVOUR IT. YOU SEEM TO BE VERY GOOD AT THAT. OH. THERESA. YOU ALL RIGHT? I'VE NEVER BEEN IN AN ARGUMENT BEFORE. I'VE NEVER SAID THOSE THINGS TO ANYBODY. I FEEL LIKE I'M GOING TO THROW UP. JUST TAKE A DEEP BREATH. YOU'LL BE FINE. I ACTUALLY STOOD UP FOR MYSELF FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE... NOT THAT I HAD MUCH CHOICE. WHAT? YOU JUST SAT THERE. YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING TO STOP HER. LIKE WHAT? WELL, I DON'T KNOW. SCREAM AT HER, SLAP HER-- JUST GET HER TO LEAVE ME ALONE. THERESA, SHE'S MY MOTHER. SO THAT GIVES HER THE RIGHT TO RIP ME APART? WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO? FIGHT FOR ME. FIGHT FOR YOU? YOU'VE GOT TO UNDERSTAND MY MOTHER. SHE'S OLD. SHE'S SET IN HER WAYS. IT'S GOING TO TAKE HER A WHILE TO GET USED TO YOU. NO, IT WON'T. WHY NOT? BECAUSE I WON'T BE AROUND. OH, PLEASE DON'T DO THIS. NO. I WANT A GUY WHO WILL ALWAYS FIGHT FOR ME, WHO WILL ALWAYS STAND UP FOR ME, WHO WILL NEVER LET ME DOWN. I THOUGHT THAT GUY WAS YOU. I WAS WRONG. WAIT A MINUTE, THERESA. TAXI! COME ON. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? DON'T DO THIS. LOOK, DON'T DO THIS. THERESA, LET'S TALK ABOUT IT, ALL RIGHT? JUST TALK TO ME. I'M STARVING. I'M GOING TO THE KITCHEN TO GET SOMETHING TO EAT. I SUPPOSE YOU'RE PROUD OF YOURSELF. JUST TELLING IT LIKE IT IS. THAT'S BEEN YOUR EXCUSE FOR THE LAST 67 YEARS. MY EXCUSE? YOUR EXCUSE FOR HURTING PEOPLE WHENEVER THE HELL YOU FEEL LIKE IT. I DON'T HURT PEOPLE. OH, NO? I GUESS YOU DIDN'T HURT AUNT DOLLY ON HER WEDDING DAY WHEN YOU SAID SHE LOOKED LIKE A CHEAP LAS VEGAS HOOKER. WELL, DID YOU SEE THE WEDDING DRESS? THE BACK OF IT WAS CUT RIGHT DOWN TO HERE. YOU COULD SEE THE CRACK OF HER-- WELL, IT WAS INDECENT. AND I GUESS YOU DIDN'T HURT COUSIN JERRY WHEN YOU CALLED HIS GERMAN WIFE A NAZI WHO PROBABLY SLEPT WITH HITLER. WELL, THERE'S NO PROOF THAT SHE DIDN'T. I GUESS YOU NEVER HURT DAD EITHER. I NEVER HURT YOUR FATHER, EVER. FLORSHEIM SHOES? HOW DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT? YOU CAME HOME LATE. YOU WERE ARGUING. I WOKE UP. I WAS SCARED. I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON, SO I LISTENED IN AT THE DOOR. A LITTLE SPY. COME ON. I WAS ONLY 12. SPY! FLORSHEIM SHOES WAS HIS BIG ACCOUNT. HE WORKED ON THAT FOR OVER 2 1/2 YEARS. YOU BLEW IT FOR HIM IN ONE NIGHT. DANNY, DON'T. ALL HE HAD TO DO WAS SIGN A DEAL AT DINNER-- ONE FANCY-SCHMANCY DINNER WITH A V.P. FROM FLORSHEIM. I'M GOING TO BED. NO, YOU'RE NOT. EVERYTHING WAS FINE THAT EVENING-- DINNER WAS PERFECT, DAD HAD HIM IN THE PALM OF HIS HAND UNTIL YOU DECIDED TO TELL IT LIKE IT IS. I WAS RIGHT. I STILL STAND BY WHAT I SAID. YOU CALLED DAD'S BOSSES FILTHY JEW SHYLOCKS. THEY NEVER GAVE HIM A RAISE, NOT IN 12 YEARS. NOT ONE CHRISTMAS BONUS! MA... THE VICE PRESIDENT OF FLORSHEIM AND HIS WIFE WERE JEWISH. WELL, HOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO KNOW? THEY DIDN'T LOOK JEWISH. I WASN'T TALKING ABOUT THEM. THEY TOOK IT PERSONAL. YOU LOST THE ACCOUNT FOR HIM! $450,000 TO THE COMPANY! HE'S LUCKY HE DIDN'T LOSE HIS JOB! YOUR FATHER NEVER STOOD UP TO HIS BOSSES. IT WAS TIME SOMEBODY SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT. THAT NIGHT WAS THE ONLY TIME I EVER HEARD MY FATHER CRY, AND STILL, TO THIS DAY, YOU STILL TELL IT LIKE IT IS. I DON'T MEAN TO HURT PEOPLE. REALLY. WHERE ARE YOU GOING? TO HALSTED. A FRIEND OF MINE OWNS A JEWELRY SHOP. HE OWES ME A FAVOR. I'M GOING TO MAKE HIM OPEN UP HIS STORE. THEN I'M GOING TO BUY THE BIGGEST ENGAGEMENT RING I CAN AFFORD. THEN I'M GOING TO ASK THERESA LUNA TO BE MY WIFE. JUST TELLING IT LIKE IT IS, MA. [MOTOR WHIRRING] [TAP TAP TAP] [TAP TAP TAP] WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WELL, I WAS JUST IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD, AND I THOUGHT I'D DROP BY. SOMETIMES IT'S GOOD TO BE A COP. WHAT DO YOU WANT? I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I'LL ALWAYS STAND BY YOU AND I'LL NEVER LET YOU DOWN AGAIN. I SWEAR. AND, UH... OH! I GOT THE LIGHT BLUE STONES. I...WELL, I THOUGHT YOU'D LIKE THAT. WILL YOU MARRY ME? YES. GREAT. YEAH! WAY TO GO! YO, DANNY! YAY! WHOO! ALL RIGHT! WHOO! HEY, MR. HAPPY, HOW ABOUT A TOWEL? GETTING MARRIED. MAIL-ORDER BRIDE? HA HA HA HA! HEH HEH HEH HEH. THAT BOBBY'S A REAL ASSHOLE, YOU KNOW THAT? HEY, DANNY. WELL, MY BEST FRIEND IS MAKING THE BIGGEST MISTAKE OF HIS LIFE, SO I THOUGHT THAT DESERVED A TOAST. I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE DOING IT, DANNY. I TOLD YOU, IT'S BECAUSE I LOVE HER. AND YOUR MOTHER? SHE HATES ITALIANS, YOU KNOW THAT. SHE GOT USED TO YOU. TOOK HER 15 YEARS. AND SHE'LL GET USED TO THERESA. YEAH, BUT SHE'S GOING TO MISS YOU, DANNY. I'M JUST GETTING MARRIED, THAT'S ALL. SHE'S TAKING THIS FINE. AS A MATTER OF FACT, SHE'S HANDLING IT VERY WELL. OH, SHE IS, IS SHE? YES, SHE IS, REALLY. HELLO, MRS. MULDOON. OH, YEAH, RIGHT. HELLO, SAL. JESUS, MA! WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? OH, STOP FUSSING. I'VE PROBABLY DIAPERED HALF OF THEM. COME ON. WHY? WE HAVE AN APPOINTMENT. WITH WHO? THE POLACK PRIEST. THE POLACK PRIEST? OHH... WHY? WE'VE GOT TO SETTLE OUR PROBLEMS. WELL, CAN'T THIS WAIT TILL LATER? THE PROTESTANTS AND THE JEWS GO TO THE PSYCHIATRIST. WE GO TO THE PRIEST. YOU FEEL THREATENED BY THERESA. THREATENED? YES. SEE, SHE'S TAKING UP A LOT OF DANNY'S TIME, SO YOU'RE FEELING THREATENED THAT SHE'S TRYING TO STEAL YOUR SON. WHAT? ROSE... I KNOW YOU REALIZE IT'S THE NINETIES. I'M JUST NOT SURE YOU REALIZE IT'S THE 1990s. I'VE NEVER BEEN THREATENED BY ANYONE, EVER, AND I'VE BEEN THROUGH D-DAY, KOREA, VIETNAM-- JUST RELAX. YOU SEE THAT? THAT'S WHAT I DON'T WANT TO BECOME. I DON'T WANT TO BE LIKE ONE OF THOSE OLD LADIES WHO SPENDS THE REST OF THEIR LIVES STANDING IN LINE. WHAT DO YOU MEAN, STANDING IN LINE? WELL, THEY STAND IN LINE FOR THE CONFESSIONAL EVERY SINGLE DAY, EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE NO SINS TO CONFESS, JUST SO THEY CAN BLATHER WITH THE PRIEST ABOUT VATICAN II. AND THEY STAND IN LINE OUTSIDE THE MOVIE THEATER, EVEN THOUGH THEY'VE SEEN THE MOVIE 10 TIMES, JUST SO THEY CAN COMPLAIN TO WHOEVER'S STANDING NEAR THEM ABOUT THE PRICE OF THE TICKET. AND THEY STAND IN LINE AT THE GROCERY STORE JUST SO THEY CAN COMPLAIN TO THE CASHIER ABOUT THE PRICE OF FROZEN STRING BEANS, WHETHER THEY SHOULD BE 29 CENTS OR 39 CENTS. AND DO YOU KNOW WHY THEY SPEND SO MUCH TIME STANDING IN LINE? NO. BECAUSE THERE'S NOBODY ELSE IN THE WHOLE WORLD THEY CAN TALK TO. HOW DOES THAT LOOK? LOOKS GOOD. YEAH? LOOKS REAL GOOD. FEELS ALL RIGHT, TOO, YOU KNOW? WHAT DO YOU THINK? YOU LIKE THE STYLE OF THIS? YEAH. IT'S FINE. HMM? JUST FINE? I THOUGHT IT LOOKED PRETTY GOOD. WHAT'S WITH YOU? COME ON. YOU'VE BEEN MOPING AROUND ALL DAY. THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE FUN. HEY, COULD YOU GUYS GIVE US A MINUTE? THANKS. LOOK, DANNY... YEAH? I BEEN THINKING. YEAH? MAYBE, UH...

GO TO FLORIDA WITH MOM. MAYBE YOU'LL MEET SOME KNOCKOUT IN A BIKINI. SOMETHING WRONG WITH THERESA? I DIDN'T SAY THAT. DID YOU HEAR ME SAY THAT? THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THERESA. SHE'S JUST-- JUST WHAT? WELL, SHE'S A LITTLE PLAIN. OH. A LITTLE PLAIN, HUH? YEAH. AND WHAT'S THIS, THE COVER OF GQ? OH, THIS IS HOT, HUH? GREAT LOOK. I'LL BUY NEXT MONTH'S ISSUE. I JUST THINK THAT YOU CAN DO BETTER. I DON'T THINK SO. THIS IS THE GIRL. YOU GOT THAT? SHE'S THE ONE. DAN, TAKE IT EASY. I'M JUST BEING TRUTHFUL. I MEAN, WE'RE BROTHERS, RIGHT? WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE TRUTHFUL WITH EACH OTHER. DON'T GIVE ME THIS TWO-WAY LAWYER CRAP. AND WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN? YOU COULDN'T GIVE TWO SHITS ABOUT ME OR THERESA. ALL YOU CARE ABOUT IS YOURSELF. HEY, THAT IS BULLSHIT! IS IT? YOU WANT ME TO CHANGE MY MIND. YOU WANT ME TO GO FLORIDA AND LIVE WITH MA. THEN YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO FEEL SO GUILTY. HEY, DANNY, COME ON. THAT-- FORGET IT. THIS IS MY CHANCE. YOU UNDERSTAND? YOU TOOK YOUR CHANCE. YOU GOT SOMEONE TO WAKE UP WITH IN THE MORNING. YOU GOT A HOUSEFUL OF KIDS. YOU GOT A TRAIN AROUND THE CHRISTMAS TREE AND LITTLE ONES RUNNING AROUND IN HALLOWEEN OUTFITS. NOW YOU WANT ME TO FEEL GUILTY FOR WANTING THE SAME THINGS? FUCK YOU! LISTEN TO YOU.

WHAT IS IT? I'M FINE. REALLY. COME ON, DANNY. I'VE GOT A LOT ON MY MIND. OK? YOU CAN TELL ME. IT'S JUST THAT... YEAH? EVER SINCE MY DAD DIED, I'VE BEEN IN CHARGE. MA AND PATRICK-- THEY'VE DEPENDED ON ME TO BE RESPONSIBLE, TO TAKE CARE OF THINGS, AND I HAVE. I'VE ALWAYS BEEN THERE FOR THEM WHEN THEY NEEDED ME. EVERYTHING I'VE EVER DONE, EVERY DECISION I'VE EVER MADE WAS FOR THEM. I MEAN, I BECAME A COP BECAUSE MA WANTED PATRICK TO GO TO LAW SCHOOL. SHE DIDN'T HAVE THE EXTRA MONEY, SO...I CAME THROUGH. AND, I... AND I'D DO IT AGAIN. I'M NOT COMPLAINING. IT'S JUST THAT... WELL, NOW... YOU AND ME... IT'S THE ONLY TIME... THE ONLY TIME IN MY LIFE I'VE MADE A DECISION WITHOUT THINKING OF THEM FIRST. AND... I GUESS I'M A LITTLE SCARED. I'M AFRAID THEY'RE GOING TO THINK THAT I'VE ABANDONED THEM. I KNOW THAT SOUNDS STUPID. I JUST... I JUST DON'T WANT TO LOSE MY FAMILY.

NEW YORK. 3:15 TRAIN. OH, DAMN. [SIREN] LOIS, THIS IS DANNY MULDOON. YEAH, DANNY. GET ME FREDDIE NUNZIO AT UNION STATION AND HURRY. 10-4. JESUS, MARY, AND JOSEPH! WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING HERE? DANNY GAVE ME HIS TICKET. THE THOUGHT OF YOU TRAVELING TO FLORIDA ALL ALONE... NEARLY BROKE MY HEART. THAT'S WHY I'M HERE. A KISS BEFORE TAKEOFF? FORGET IT. I'M GOING TO SLEEP. WELL, AT LAST, WE GET TO SLEEP TOGETHER. FOLKS, WE HAVE TO MAKE AN UNSCHEDULED STOP HERE. THERE'S GOING TO BE A BIT OF A DELAY. FOR SECURITY REASONS, EVERYONE WILL HAVE TO DEBOARD THE TRAIN. WE'RE SORRY FOR THE INCONVENIENCE. THANK YOU. THERESA! HI. YOU DID ALL THIS, DIDN'T YOU? SOMETIMES IT'S GOOD TO BE A COP. SO WHAT DO YOU WANT? ALL ABOARD! I--I--I... I JUST WANT-- I--I... DON'T YOU HATE ALL THE UNCOMFORTABLE STUFF THAT GOES WITH TRYING TO ASK SOMEBODY TO GET BACK TOGETHER WITH YOU? I'LL MAKE IT EASY FOR YOU. I'LL GIVE YOU A LIST OF EXCUSES. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS ANSWER YES OR NO, OK? GOOD. HERE GOES. REASONS WHY YOU AND I CAN'T GET BACK TOGETHER-- YOU'RE SEEING SOMEBODY ELSE. NO. YOU'RE MOVING INTO A CONVENT. NO. YOU'RE HAVING YOUR LEGS WAXED? NO. YOU'VE FALLEN OUT OF LOVE WITH ME. NO. NO? NO. THAT'S GREAT. MAY-MAYBE, UH... YOU AND ME, WE SHOULD-- YOU FORGOT ONE THING. WHAT? YOUR MOTHER. SHE'S GONE. TO FLORIDA? SHE'S ON A PLANE. SO HOW DO I KNOW YOU WON'T HOP A FLIGHT TO BE WITH HER TOMORROW OR NEXT WEEK OR NEXT MONTH? BECAUSE I'M THE ONE WHO LET HER GO... AND I'M READY TO PUT US FIRST. FINAL BOARDING CALL FOR ALL PASSENGERS TRAVELING TO NEW YORK CITY! COME ON. WHERE? WELL, WE'RE BOARDING. YOU'RE GOING TO NEW YORK? I KNOW THIS POLICE SERGEANT IN THE BRONX. HE TRANSFERRED FROM CHICAGO. MAYBE HE CAN PULL A FEW STRINGS, YOU KNOW? GIVE ME A LINE ON A JOB. YOU'D DO THAT? YOU'D LEAVE EVERYTHING BEHIND JUST TO BE WITH ME? YEAH. I LOVE YOU. I LOVE YOU, TOO. [AIRPLANE ENGINES ROAR] TO OUR HOMELAND, OR WE WILL ALL DIE! NOBODY MOVE! ROSE! [CHEERING] DANNY, RELAX. I CAN TAKE CARE OF MYSELF. IS EVERYTHING OK? COULDN'T BE BETTER. COME ON.
