I have no place to go. [panting] [screaming] [doorbell ringing]Let me in! Let me in! [doorbell ringing] Let me in! Let me in! Let me in! Okay, all right. Let me in! Let me in! You're okay. You're in, you're in. Let me in! Nurse, nurse, get a jacket. Let me in!Call the doctor! She was probably gonna do another suicide. You know, that's one of her favorite things. Keep your voice down, nurse. Sorry, Doctor. You know this patient well? Marie? Huh, practically grew up here in the castle. 16, the first time she came here. What about before that? [Nurse] She grew up in an orphanage until she was five, and then she was adopted by the, uh, Bartellos? An Italian couple in their 50s. [woman] Italiana? [nun] Si, Italiana. They have rules, and they want you to obey them. You can't talk to anyone about family things. Marie, they don't want you to cry. Grazie, mille grazie. Go get a blanket. Pa. [young Marie] "The rain is falling all around. "It falls on fields and trees. "It falls on the umbrellas here and on the ships at sea." Bene. [fire crackling] Bella... You know, Dr. Blackwell, her father ran a fishing boat, so he was gone a lot of the time. And the mother'd knock her around a bit. Well, just strict, you know? [nurse] She'd lock her out, you know, overnight, to scare her. I'm sorry, Pa. Your mama, she told me you go with the boys. No! I was not, I was reading. You like me to read, Pa. Please don't-- Pa? [speaking Italian sternly] Puttana. First time they brought her here, it was a suicide attempt. And there have been plenty since. They have tried everything on her short of a lobotomy. They've tried the shock, insulin, the tubs. ♪♪ If you ask me, she'll be here till she dies. Don't you ever talk that way in front of her. Sorry, Doctor. Get that jacket off her.Yes, Doctor. And call her father, let him know she's here. Ma. Marie? Marie? Hi. I was brought here by the most dreadful and agonizing of all apprehensions. The fear of losing the one dear being... on whom my every wish and hope are set. [nurse] Dr. Blackwell? That mean anything to you? Yes. "The fear of losing the one dear being on whom my every wish and hope are fixed." Tell me, Marie. Marie? Yeah? What did you like to do at the beach? Run. Run. How fast could you run? Fast. Well, Marie... this place... This isn't such a good place for running, I'm afraid. I like it here. Marie, I spoke to someone this morning who's staying with your mother. She told me that your mother sent you away. My mommy's probably gonna come see me, probably. My real mommy. Your natural mother did come to see you here, didn't she? When you were 22. You even went home with her. You remember that? Hello, Marie. I'm your mother. I've come to take you home. But you came back only four days later, why? My mommy's gonna come see me. 'Cause she loves me too much is why. Can I have a cigarette? I didn't think little girls smoked. Well, I do. I'm sorry, I don't have any. Marie, I'm re-admitting you as a patient. I don't want to start you on any medication yet. I think you need to mourn your father's death without... Why doesn't she like me? Why? [quiet knock on door] If you're ready, I think it's time we settled you on your ward. All right? Marie? Hello, Marie. You remember me? So you have a friend to walk with you. Would you mind waiting outside while I speak to Betty for a moment? Thanks. Okay, you sit on the bench. You'll be fine. And I'll come get you in a minute. Her father died and her mother kicked her out. She's severely depressed, suicidal maybe. How well did you know her? A little. I came in right before she went out. [Dr. Blackwell] She needs to know there's someone on her side, that she's not alone. Give her as much time as you can. Come on, Marie. Let's go. Marie, come. Rhonda, here's Marie. Okay, here we go again, eh, Marie? Nice to see you back. Back in your old ward, right? Here's your bed. See you when I get back! [indistinct chatter] [woman] Hey, Marie, you all right? You ought to go slow. [attendant] All right, Mrs. Katzky, you had another one of your little accidents, huh? Come on, come on. Go on over there. That's right. All right. Wipe it up. [chatter] Stop talking now, Marie, and eat. Marie, eat. You had better eat that, Marie. I don't want it. Now you quit playing around, please. Mangia, mangia, Marie. No! No, no. Mangia. [speaking Italian] Stop it, stop it! Betty! Betty, come here! No! Stop it, stop it! Stop it, stop it!Marie! Stop it, stop it... Marie!Stop it, stop it! [Marie gasping] No running, Marie. Oh, thank you, God. Thank you for sending my mother. Oh, where were you? Where were you? I wanted you to come back. Marie, don't hold Dr. Blackwell so tight. I prayed you'd come back. I prayed.Hello, Marie. I've come to take you home. Oh, mother... Were you frightened because I went away? I don't know what's happening. I can't stop it. It's all right. You're going to be fine. I can't breathe. It's the flowers. Marie... It's the flowers. I just can't breathe. Marie, calm down. Oh, God. Calm down. Oh, Mother. God! [sobbing] Betty's going to put you to bed. And I'll come back at the end of my rounds, okay? It's all right. I'm very tired.Good. I'm so tired. Good, let's lay down. Come on. Let's lay down for a minute, okay? Yeah, it's okay. Oh, please, if you think she's crazy, you'll see. You! I'm talking to you! You shut up! Shut up! I tell you! Rhonda! Call the police.All right, all right, Barbara. I tell you.Yes, tell me in the bathroom. I tell you. You know, you like to go in the bathroom... I told you to shut up! You make me sick! You make me wanna puke! [Marie sobbing] All right, ladies, everybody out for some nice fresh air. That's right, do your coats up, dear. Come on, do your coat. Come on, Marie. Do your coat up, dear, that's right. Come on, Marie, I haven't got all day. No, no. Quick, ladies, all right, come on. No. Marie, come on. Now, we're going out for some air. No. Marie! No! Stay there now ladies. Don't lock me out! I will lock you out for one hour. No! Come on, Marie. Marie! Don't lock me out! [speaking Italian]No! No! [speaking Italian] [speaking Italian] Get away. Oh, oh... Come on, come on, Marie. Help! Everything's gonna be okay. Let me go now. Emergency, please, Ward C. Send two male attendants, please, and a doctor. [screaming] It's all right. [panicked panting] [glass shattering] Oh, oh. Get her down. Get her to the floor. Get her to the floor. No! Get away! Get away, get away. Get away! Get away from me! Get away from me! Get away! Okay, okay, I got her. [crying] [hysterical crying] [screaming] Take her to the seclusion room. Take her to the back ward. Get away! Get away. [screaming] [Blackwell] Please, stop it. I'm removing this patient, Doctor. She's my patient, I will decide. Take her back to Ward C. No! [male doctor] Ward A, now. Why was she on that ward? She's violent. Marie is not violent.She attacked a nurse. Oh, I wouldn't say that...She had a panic attack because she was terrified of being locked out out of the only place she feels safe. I know schizophrenic behavior when I see it. [male doctor] She's in my care now. [dialogue inaudible] [detached whispering] Die, die, die... [indistinct patient chatter] [Dr. Blackwell] 2,000 milligrams of Phenothiazine a day could be fatal for all we know. But there is a chance, a possibility that these massive doses could turn around a schizophrenic that is incurable. I won't question that, but it hasn't worked. She can't walk, she can't talk, she's almost catatonic. Give her back to me. Let me try another medication that'll stabilize her. It won't work. Give her up. I can't. I don't believe she's hopeless. When I look in Marie's eyes, I see someone there. You see more than I do. All right. Thank you.Thank you, Doctor. [car starting] Marie? You listen to me. I mean it, you listen. This is a dangerous place. Don't you understand that? Well, you better start to understand it. You could've died in here. You don't wanna die, Marie. Dr. Blackwell and I can't always save you. Youhave to save you. [patients murmurings] I wish to hell I could take 'em all out of here. Marie can't walk, she can't feed herself. She hasn't even talked in two years. How can you reverse her condition? First, we'll start taking her off all that Phenothiazine. And then we'll try other medications until we find one that stabilizes her. If I'm right, Marie is suffering from an anxiety disorder. Good girl. [panicked breathing] Come on, Marie. Okay, okay. Just try. Try. The night we first met, you quoted a passage from Dickens. I want to read you something else he wrote. "You belong to much brighter and better scenes "than this, my little one. "And you are not to look back here again. "You are to look away to very different and much happier paths." This isn't your home, Marie. This isn't anybody's home. See a different path. Imagine it... and take it out of here. All right, Marie, here we go. Your napkin's all tucked in. Now, we are gonna get this milk down you. There we go. Come on, here you go. [metal scraping] No! Hold it, Barbara. You are gonna dump that...[crashing] Sara, call Dr. Blackwell. That's a dead man's hand, so I win. And whoever wins is the winner. You don't show me your cards, Marie. One, good. Two... [woman] Come on, up like a bird, that's right. [all speaking simultaneously] Three, okay. Four... okay. Five, okay. Now we're gonna do another one. Okay, no-no-no-no-no. Okay, good, all right, let's go. [woman] We're gonna do another exercise now. Okay, let's put our hands on our hips. And we're gonna turn, twisting. One... all right, okay, okay, that's it. Don't get so excited. Don't get so excited. Come on. Why are you not looking? Let's put our hands on our hips, let's go. There she goes... [chuckling]. Space man. [laughing] There she goes. No-no-no, dear, come on, stand up, stand up. Stand up. Come on, stand up, we're doing exercises. Put your hands on your hips. That's right, now turn, that's good. That's right. Come on... [overlapping chatter] Uh, well, I don't know. Would you like me to call him? I... I wanna go out. Hey, Marie, you talked. You talked! Come on, then. I forgot you could talk. ♪♪ Marie, what do you see? Have the courage. I think you're gonna enjoy it. How you doing, okay? Good. [distant train whistle] [man] She's not ready to be here. [Dr. Blackwell] She thinks she is. She asked to be. Oh, we're letting the patients make their own decisions now? She's stabilized on her medication. Oh, yeah? How stable? Call it an experiment. [machines whirring] Please. Please don't let me fail. [man] So the third guys say, "Well, I don't know about you, but I'm driving to Mexico." [laughing] That was the punch line? Yeah, don't you get it? Because--That's terrific. Oh, never mind, if I have to explain it, there's not point even to--Okay, back to work. Jeez, I'm gonna get sloppy here, aren't I? Yeah.All right. Come on, tough guy. I'll clean up my act later. [typewriter bell dings] Teach me that. Well... Teach me. Teach me. Okay, sure, but we're-- Marie, you know you're not supposed to come in here. She needs special permission to be in here. I'll get permission. Okay. [keys clacking] Good. Marie, you're learning very fast. Now don't worry about some of these mistakes. Bye, Marie. We'll see you tomorrow! She can't even hear you, Shari. I know. But every day, she stays a few minutes longer. [Shari] The thing that's great about living at home with my folks, the food. Oh. Last night, my dad made a cake-- triple chocolate. Okay, you're making me hungry.[chuckling] That's all right. I'll make one one of these days, bring it in. Yeah, yeah. Only I'm gonna make it for Marie. For you, for the first day that you work a whole day, okay? And then we can celebrate. So, Marie, how'd I do on that letter I gave you? There's three L's in "parallel." Oh, yeah? Never was much of a speller. [panting] [screaming] Marie, quit it. Calm down. Nurses station. Alert Betty one of her patients has left the workshop in distress. [door shuts] We might as well go to lunch, huh? Hi, Marie. Hi. Hi. ♪ Dum, dah-dum. ♪ It's your cake. But I didn't do it. Oh, but you nearly did. Yeah, and you will. I mean, we know you will. Oh, Marie. It's okay. Here, sweetie. Let's go comb our hair, okay? Come on. Be right back. Oh, come on. We just think you're doing a terrific job. You know what Joe said about you the other day? He said you have a lot of courage. Oh... My hair is a wreck, Look at that. Do you go out with Joe? Yeah, sure, for lunch and stuff. It's great the way they let him leave the grounds whenever he wants to. Most of the patients can't do that. Hey, I bet they're gonna let-- What did I say? Joe is a patient? Yeah, you didn't know that? He's a, um, manic depressive. But he takes, um... lithium, yeah. So he still gets kind of down sometimes. He gets very quiet. But mostly he's just good old Joe. The only thing I don't understand is why he's still living at the castle. Oh, then again, he says he likes to walk to work. Are you and Joe getting married? What? Marie, come on. Joe and I are just buddies. You know what? You have gorgeous eyes. We have to do something to bring them out. Now, let's see. Open this up, and let me give you this. A little present, underneath the braid. Oh, great. What are you gonna wear? Oh, I have so many. Come on. Anyway, it goes with your eyes better. Great, and... perfume. Oh, a little bit here, there, whoop, everywhere, great, okay. And... And your hair. Let's do something. Okay. Oh, beautiful. You smell nice. [keys clacking] Oh, thanks. Is there anything else? Nope, you're too fast for me, Marie. I can't keep up. [Shari] Marie, wait up. Boy, are you doing great. Keep it up, I'm gonna be out of a job. You have a nice evening, okay? You too.Okay, see you tomorrow. [car starting] [Dr. Blackwell] I'd like to recommend that Marie Bartello be placed in the home of Lucy and Bob Stavros. Marie has met with them briefly, and I've discussed her history with them. You want her to live with--With normal people. To start leading a normal life. That's what we want for all of our patients. Marie has lived outside this hospital for only brief periods of time since she was a teenager. She's how old now? 36.36. 20 years in this institution. And I believe less than a year ago she couldn't even feed herself.Uh-huh. And look how far she's come since then. She's stabilized on her medication. Yes, that's why she shouldn't be pushed. That's why Marie will keep coming to the hospital five days a week to work at the office where she earns a wage. And she'll pay for her room and board at the Stavros home by doing some housekeeping and tending to the baby. The baby? Marie isn't dangerous. The point is can she function? Marie has hope. We didn't give her that. She almost died. What she really needs is for us to get out of her way. Fine. You release her. You place her with this family. But her file will contain my opinion that she's unstable and should remain institutionalized indefinitely. So it's on your head. No. It's on hers. Okay, everybody ready? Um... Go get 'em, Marie. Yeah, go get 'em, Marie! You did it. You did it, too. [speaks indistinctly] Bet you a quarter she'll be back in six months. Three. White ain't your color. [laughing and chattering] [distant singing and partying] [dog barking] You ready? The door's closed. They'll open it. What if they don't? What if it's locked? What if they change their mind? Did you forget to put on your wool socks? What? Sounds like you're getting cold feet. Yeah, well, if this is such a good idea, how come you're not doing it? I'm fine where I am, but I think that for you, this is a good idea. You can do this. Come on. [man] You're not changing your mind on us, are you? Come on in. It's cold. Welcome. Jimmy. Hi. Hi, I'm Joe. So, Mister Sweet Bum, are you gonna have your bath? Oh, Marie? I'm gonna give this banana his bath. You wanna help me? Oh, I don't know much about babies. He's a tough guy. We can practice on him. Come on. Put your book down, there you go. Okay, okay, here we go, here we go. This is the guy who loves his bath. Yeah, see? Yeah, he loves it. Okay, I'm gonna get him all wet all over. Oh. Oh, my God, I'm sorry. Oh, hang onto him for a sec while I get a towel. Oh... You're full of beans, ain't you? Let me get you here.Oh, it's okay. Okay. Can I use the soap?Yeah, yeah. [baby sneezing]Oh, bless you, Jimmy. Yeah, you can wash him, good. Now, I wanna ask you. Next week is Thanksgiving. Do you want to invite a guest? Oh, I don't know. Well, yeah, I think you should. The more the merrier. I don't know. Well, you think about it. No, you do it.Okay. Big guy, big guy. There we go. They told me I could invite somebody to Thanksgiving. So if you'd like to come, you can. Yeah, okay. Hi, Joe, happy Thanksgiving.Hey, hi, I remembered. You too. Okay. Oh, Marie, can you light the candles for me, honey? Look at this. Just look at this. [excited chatter] Look at that. [pleasant chatter] Thanks. Well... Wanna go to a movie Saturday night? Who? You ready?Yeah, yeah, sure am. Thanks again. Oh, you come anytime, Joe. Maybe. [chuckling] ♪♪ Hey, hey, this is a date. Two.It's my date, too. You can buy the popcorn. You cheated. I did not, I won. [laughing] Oh, oh. Where'd you learn to sprint like that? When I was little. [chuckling] She told me you go with the boys. Did you like the movie? Yeah. Uh, I had a real good time. I had a good time, too. Good night. [wind blowing] Yeah, come on in. You're gonna read us out of house and home if you keep this up, Marie. What have you got there? "Bleak House". "Bleak House". You get through it okay? I've read it before. Oh, Dickens fan. You read a lot at the hospital? No. Before. My father... he liked books, music. Are you doing homework? No, I'm just grading papers. No, I guess it is my homework. I always wanted to go to college. Hmm? I said I always wanted to go to college. Oh, yeah? I'm probably too old anyway. Nope, never too old. I'm probably not smart enough anyway. Marie, anyone who's read "Bleak House" twice is smart-- You-- You know, if you're serious, you could take a class or two at the community college where I teach. No, you could. Oh, I don't think I could afford it. It's not that expensive. State rehab could help you out, that's what they're there for. Marie, Joe's here. Marie, it's just the next step. Don't stop now. Hi. It's getting cold out there. Well, a good night for the two of you to stay in, I'd say, huh? Yeah, my wife and I are going to take advantage of our two good friends, and leave you here to babysit while we leave. What if something happens? Oh, it can't-- Nothing can happen. Emergency number's by the phone and we'll be back by 10:00. Later, alligator.You guys have fun. Bye-bye. You'll be fine, good-bye! Where are you going? Check the baby. No, hey, I think you'd get a lot out of college. These young kids, they're just in it for a good time. Did you go to college?Sure did. And I had a great time. Mmm. Did you make this? Jeez... you're getting good. You ought to open a stand over at the castle. Right outside the cafeteria. That'd goose 'em up a little bit. What are you still doing living there, Joe? You're healthier than me. Don't tell me you like to walk to work either. Oh. Marie, it would-- It would take too long to... That's okay, you can tell it short. Marie, I am a manic-depressive. Do you know what that means? But you're stabilized, right? Well, yeah, right now, I am. But... when I get sick... Marie, I can't-- I can't even hold a job. When I'm... manic, I go on these spending sprees, and I run up these huge bills and... And then I crash, and I can't even get out of bed for weeks. Or... Or months even. And the last time it happened, I lost everything. And I just don't think that I can go through that again. But if you keep on your medications, then you wouldn't get that sick again. You don't know that! Nobody know-- Let's have some coffee, huh? I guess you're sorry you came over. Why? They don't even have a television set. There's nothing to do. Um... We... we could sing.[striking piano chord] We'll wake the baby. Scrabble. How about Scrabble? You can't play Scrabble. You can't spell. Oh, yeah. Well, why don't we just put on the gloves and go a few rounds, huh? Quit it, Joe. Come on, tough guy. Put 'em up. As long as we're gonna fight, let's really fight, huh? Quit it, Joe. Come on, Marie. I mean it, Joe, quit it! Let me have it right there. Give me your best shot. Quit it, Joe. I mean it, Joe, stop it! Marie... What's the matter? We just can't get along. It's good we found out now. Well... I-I think that we could get along. I'm afraid, Joe. Oh... There's nothing to be afraid of. ♪♪ [rain pattering] [Marie] So I'm just gonna take the one class just to see if I can do it. [Lucy] Right, you're just gonna ease into it. Yeah, I'm gonna quit the workshop so I can really concentrate. Because I know this is gonna be very different for me. Yes, yes, I think that's just... Oh, savings. Say something about-- Oh, the savings. And I have some savings, and I get board at your house. So all I need is a little grant, just to cover the books and the tuition. Right, that's perfect.Next! Oh. Give 'em hell. Your intelligence is not in question, but these very negative reports from two of your doctors? No, I'm sorry, I cannot approve such aid. You're a poor risk. Nothing personal, Miss Bartello. You may go. [train whistle blowing] [gulls squawking] [glass shatters] I wanna sign up for a class, but I don't have any money. I-- you better know this, I'm-- I've been a mental patient most of my life. I'm still on medication, and I probably always will be. But I'm living on the outside now, and that's where I'm gonna stay. But I need more than food and a roof over my head. I wanna be completely self-reliant. I have a good mind, and I'm ready to work hard. I want a college education. And I'll use it. I'll use it well. But state rehab won't help me. They don't think I can make it. But a lot of people didn't think I could make it this far. I know I can do it, I-- I just need some help. Please help me, please don't lock me out, just... Listen, why don't you just have a seat and we'll see what we can do, hmm? [indistinct chatter] Frankly, I'm amazed to see so many of you here. My reputation must be slipping. You'll be reading a minimum of 400 pages a week. [book thudding loudly] There'll be tests-- a mid-term and a final. Flunk one or miss one and you've flunked the course. I don't give make-up tests. You'll be tested on all the works you read. [voice becomes garbled and echoing] Why don't we begin. [voice garbled and echoing] There are actually five things you need to do before you put your first sentence on a sheet of paper. Now, why don't we look at the five important pre-writing steps that experienced writers follow. Knowing how a native writer of English brainstorms before beginning to write will help you to approach writing in English the same way that native writers do. Brainstorms does such deep thinking about a subject that it's thought to cause a storm in the brain... A poem by Elizabeth I. [door closing] Marie, what are you... Marie? What are you--Go away and close the door. I most certainly will not. Go away, I don't want you to look at me. I don't want anyone to look at me. That's fairly obvious. I said to go away! Go away, go away! I need clean towels. How was class? I can't do it. I just can't do it. Why am I even trying to do it? I wanna die. I just wanna die. I know today was hard for you. The first time you do something's always hard for everybody. I don't have a chance in hell! My mother was crazy, too! All my life I dreamed she'd come. When I was little, they told me that she'd died. And I kept dreaming. I still kept dreaming. I prayed all the time that she would find me, and one day she did. Only she was crazy! She was crazy, just like I am. And she died crazy, just like I will! Oh, Marie, I'm-- I'm as sorry as I can be that your mother... But right now, you're just not crazy. Right now, you're just my friend Marie... who's had a very anxiety-filled morning. And you're talking to your friend Lucy, who hasn't had such a great morning herself. So... here we are, we're-- We're just telling each other what a crappy morning we've had. The way friends do. It's better than hiding in a closet. Looks pretty silly, don't you think? Huh? Come on, come on. Come here. Now, did you make it to the class at all? You did? You got there? Well, that's great, that's wonderful. It was pretty scary, though, huh? Yeah. It was pretty exciting, though, too, huh? Wasn't it? [chuckling] Right. Almost gave up on you. Why do they have to close so early? Early? What good's a library if it isn't open? I got through four years of college with less time in the library than you've spent on this one class. You think that's funny that I have to work twice as hard? No, no, no, Marie. I'm just trying to tell you that I need some time with you. I'm in that damn class every day, and I get so nervous that it all gets-- that I can't hear. Everybody else in the class can hear. I don't get it, why can't you hear? I'm not gonna pass if I can't hear. I know. I'm listening to you. You don't listen. I'm telling you that I can't hear. I know, I'm trying to understand what you're saying, Marie. You're never gonna understand. You're doing it the easy way. Maybe you're right. Maybe... maybe we're just on different tracks, and we can't seem to... I know you're under a lot of pressure, and I just don't seem to know how to... Look, you-- you just do what you have to do. And I won't take up any more of your time. "And Walt Whitman, who wrote 'Leaves of Grass', had this theory of the float." Okay, here we go. Open up, here we go, it's coming. Isn't that good, come on.

[professor] All right, come in and shut the door, people. Oh, are you... [door latching] [girl] That was impossible. What was that about the float? What float? Yes? I'm in this class. I know, you missed the test. First class you've ever missed-- bad timing. I couldn't come in-- You know my rules, no make-ups. I was here, I just got sick. You know, nerves. Hmm. I know this material. You can take it in my office. But keep this to yourself. I have a reputation to maintain. [professor] Turner. Cartie. Bartello. This is quite good, really.

I wanted to make sure that I was really gonna go through with it before I told you. Oh, Joe. Oh, that-- that's wonderful. Yeah. That's just wonderful. So, uh... Do you wanna go for a ride? A car? Joe! You got a car? Yeah. Oh, Joe. A car! A job and a car. Well, I gotta be able to get there. Course, I'm gonna look for a place as close to work as I can, but... A place? Well, a small place.

I'd really have to think about it. Well, haven't you thought about it? Well, I mean, I mean... We'd have to... think about it. So many... So many reasons why we shouldn't. Yeah, but there are a lot of reasons why we should, too. You know? [boat horn in distance Let's make a list of all the... the pros and cons. Good idea. Except I'm telling you right now, no matter how this comes out, I don't want a big wedding. Oh, me either. And the sooner the better. Okay, well... first thing is... we're both in, you know... Yeah. Now, is that a pro or a con? Joe. [chuckling] [Marie] I only said yes because I didn't know what else to say. And don't laugh at me. [Shari] Oh, I'm not. I don't know, I mean, I went to a convent school. He'll be disappointed. Oh, no. No, he will not. And you won't be either. [Joe] What time is it? I don't know, I forgot to put my watch on. It's the traffic, that's all. [chatting indistinctly] No sign yet? No. No, it's traffic is what it is. [car approaching] You can put me down here. Thanks, Joe. [knocking on door] Marie? I'm just gonna take a shower. [horn honks in distance] Marie?[shower running] Don't let the draft in.[door shuts] Hi. I'm all done. Marie... I thought Shari's dress was real cute, too. She bought hers when I bought mine. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I think she really looked cute in it. She thought at first that it was just a little too much, But I-- I thought that she had such a nice figure. She looked really nice in it. I thought everybody looked really nice. The baby looked so good in that cute little suit that he had. You know, I used to think that you had a crush on Shari, Joe. Did you know that, Joe? Well... [sighing] Did you do your own hair? Mm-hmm. What do you call that? I know you call it hair, but I mean, what do you... What do you call that style? It's supposed to be a flip. A flip? [man chuckling] All right, it's very pretty. How long's it take you to do that? [man, whispering] Ten minutes. I see. If you like, I can keep this whole interview secret for the nation. [audience laughing] How did you happen to come here this evening? What's your first name? Marion. How'd you happen to come here, Marion? Well... Just whisper. I just came. I see. Is there any reason? Did you send in for tickets? No. You didn't. How'd you like to get thrown right out, baby? [audience laughing] Uh, you ever been here before? No. Think you'll ever come again? Yes. [door opening] Hi. Hi, Joe. You love me, right? Yeah, I love you. What-- what did you do? Well, I bought my books for the new term today. Uh-huh. And that isn't all I did. Joe, this is Alan Alan, this is Joe. You remember Alan. Alan used to work in the cafeteria at the institution. Oh, right, right, hi. Hi. And, uh, I just ran into him today when I was buying the books. And I really needed some help around here. I mean, this refrigerator hasn't been cleaned out in a long time, and the whole place is a mess with both of us working, so... I hired Alan. Well, that's, uh, that's... Oh, Alan. That's great. Isn't that great, Joe? That's just great.Boy, look at that. [Marie] That's clean enough to eat out of. What... That's a pickle. You got a good heart, babe. Well, there were so many people to help me and encourage me when I came out. It just isn't like that for most people. Like Alan. Well, you were there for Alan. Yeah, but for one day, and that was just luck. I mean, luck shouldn't have anything to do with it. You know, there should be a system in place. A person just can't go from living in there and having every decision made for him to living out here, where he has to make every decision himself. It's just overwhelming, it just isn't fair. Well, what are you gonna do about it? Well, I'm gonna do something. I am, I'm gonna. Go get 'em, babe. You better not be making fun of me. [chuckling] I'm not making fun of you.

Come on, Joe, I'm serious. Yeah, I know, I know, I know you're serious. No, nothing like that. I think you ought to go for a checkup this week. Yes, ma'am. No, come on, Joe, I mean it. Don't fool around. All right. I won't fool around. Could I tell just one knock-knock joke? [laughing] Oh. Oh, Joe. I know. I know. [both laughing] Oh, I love to hear you laugh. I do, I love it. Hey, you two, smile. [camera clicking] [tires screeching] [siren approaching] I'm Marie Balter, my husband Joe Balter's in for tests. Just tests, and then they called and they said-- What did they say, Lucy? They said that the doctor called but he had to talk to-- Mrs. Balter?Yes, Doctor, what is it? Perhaps we should step in here for a moment. Yes.I need to talk to you. Certainly. Mrs. Balter... We don't fully understand, we-- We think there may be a blood clot on the lung. But, uh... he's been in a coma since early morning. Where is he? Please, follow me. He's in a coma. [sobbing] Oh, Joe. Oh... Oh, Joe. [sniffling] Oh, Joe, don't go away. [sobbing] Don't go away. [respirator hissing] As long as he's in there, she's not gonna leave that room. Did she talk to you? No, no. She'll hardly even look at me. I don't think she can take this. I'm really worried about her. [woman,over P.A.] Dr. Zimmerman, Dr. Zimmerman to Pediatrics. He was joking around the night before. Yeah. How did it get this serious? Isn't anyone around here?

[applause] Before I start, I'd like to say thank you to those of you who reached out your hands and your hearts to me. Especially Joe... for loving me, and for teaching me how to love. I only hope that I can give back, pass on all of the love and the hope and the help that was given to me. I promise you, I do have a speech here. [audience laughing] I know that when I left here that last time, there were some of you-- maybe many of you-- who were sure I'd be back. Well... here I am. [applause] ♪♪
