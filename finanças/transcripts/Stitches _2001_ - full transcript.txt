(MultiCom Jingle) (suspenseful music) (screaming) (suspenseful music) (crickets chirping) (dogs barking) - Well, of course no one really believes in the old Devil of the middle ages, with horns and a pitchfork. Anymore than people really believe God looks like the old man painted on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. - My point exactly. Gin. - You win again Robert. - I don't question the existence of evil Sam just of supernatural evil. - But if you believe in miracles-- (doorbell ringing) - Who could that be? (doorbell ringing) Where is that girl? Kathryn? (doorbell ringing) That girl. Such a good girl. - Mrs. Grove? - Yes. - It's not that I don't believe in Heaven you understand, it just that all the most interesting people seems to me would end up in the other place. - Oh Robert. - What? What is it? - Nothing. - Miss Lester what's your opinion on the subject of Hell? Miss Lester? - I have no opinion on the subject Mr. Delaney. - I think it must be a very interesting place. - Excuse me everyone. I'd like for you all to meet Mrs. Albright. She's going to be staying with us. - Hello. - Hello. - [Miss Lester] Hello. - Oh here let me run it down for you, There's Miss Lester, she teaches at the Oak Grove school. - [Miss Lester] Hi. - And there are the Delaneys, Mr. Delaney is in insurance. - We're pleased to meet you. - Thank you. - Oh and our bachelors, This is our young Mr. Reynolds, he's going to Boston tomorrow. - Ah, I have many friends in Boston. - Pleasure. - And this is our-- - Our not so young Mr. Gray. You can call me Sam. Please, sit down Mrs. Albright. - Why thank you Sam. You may call me Lucy. - I'll do so frequently. (chuckles) - I'll have to watch out for you. - No need, he's all hot air that Sam Gray. So tell us Mrs. Albright, Lucy, What's your opinion on the subject of the Devil? - The Devil? Well, he must be rather difficult to be around I'd imagine. - Well there's an answer that doesn't leave much room for doubt. - The question is, do you actually believe the Devil is at work in the world today? Sending demons here and there? - Well that is quite a question. - Thank you for finally joining us. Didn't you hear the door ring? - No Aunt Mary I was in the kitchen. - Why is it that I never have any problem hearing the door from the kitchen but it always poses such a challenge for you? - I don't know Aunt Mary. I'm sorry Aunt Mary. - Well we have a new guest. Get another cup please. Would you like tea or coffee? - [Mrs. Albright] Why tea would be lovely thank you. - Don't just stand about go on. That girl. Oh, paper dolls. You know I used to cut out paper dolls like that when I was a young girl. - Well I'm afraid paper dolls are all I can manage these days. The hands you know? - But it doesn't have a face. - Oh the face always goes on last. - The point I was trying to make is that if God has miracles then Satan must too mustn't he? - I suppose you might be right. - The trouble is miracles aren't what they used to be are they? No voice from the heavens, no Red Seas parting, no fire and brimstone. - Frankly, I think thou dost protest too much, Mr. Reynolds is it? I think you really want to believe. - You're wrong Mrs. Albright, I want to know. There's a difference. - Well then I'll tell you what I think. If the Devil has one great power on Earth, it's the power to persuade men and women to do what they secretly want to do. - So be warned. - Yes. Fair warning. (chuckles) (ominous music) (ominous music) (screaming and weeping) Where are you? Ah, there you are. Row impede, row impede, quickly bring me what I need. (ominous music) (whimpering) Go. - She lives, she lives in the house. She lives in the house. He lives in the town. They live in the kitty? Kitty? (sighs) Kitty, kitty, kitty. Hell. - [Robert] I don't understand what the problem is. It's perfectly simple, a five year old could do it. Monday is the pearl. Please say it. - [Both] Monday is the pearl. Tuesday the inlaid silver. Wednesday the bronze, and Thursday is. - Coat of arms. - The coat of arms. - [Both] Friday is polished silver. Saturday the tiger eye, and Sunday the gold. - [Robert] And today is what? - It's Thursday. - Then can you explain to me, why I had to go to work today with the inlaid silver? Is this too much for you? Am I asking too much? Is this too much for you to handle? - It's just that we were late, I was late and rushed and I just forgot. - It's like living with a child. All I want in my life is a tiny little bit of order. Just a bit. Something! I thought that I had married a woman, instead I discover that I have married a child. Isn't that what you are? Isn't it? (sobbing) Yes, that's a good answer. Cry like a baby. Just cry! Please! - Robert I love you! - That's fine. That makes everything all right doesn't it? (downbeat music) - Move on to the next, we won't be getting anything more out of Mr. Gray tonight. (shaky breathing) - Okay now remember, no amount of belief makes a fact. The world wasn't one less bit round when everyone believed it was flat was it? The question isn't whether we believe in a God, but whether there really is one. (shaky breathing) Am I right? - Yes Mr. Reynolds, we'll have to start with you. (mischievous music) (ominous music) (knocking) - [Will] Mrs. Albright? - I'm very very sorry to wake you Mr. Reynolds. - It's uh ... What's wrong? - It's my luggage you see. - Excuse me? - The men brought it from the station and it's piled up outside. I didn't want to wake anybody, but I'm afraid I-- - That's... - Would you mind? - No, no just give me a minute. - Thank you so much. - There. All set. Now if you'll excuse me I have to get up very early in the morning. - Mr. Reynolds? What would you give to know? - Excuse me? - What would you give to know? Really know, that's there's a God, a Devil, a life beyond this one. - Well, my bank account's a little slim right now Mrs. Albright. - You think I'm making clever conversation. I'm not. What would you give me if I could prove say, that demons are real. What would you give? If I could do that? (sighs) - Mrs. Albright. - Wouldn't it be worth just about anything to know? For sure? - I suppose. - Is it a deal then? - I'm sorry? - Will you give me anything I ask for? If I can prove to you that demons are real? - Why not? Anything you want. If you can convince me, but I'm hard to convince. What's that? - Ivy leaf It keeps the noise from leaving the room. We don't want to disturb the others do we? - I don't know. Why not let everyone in on it? - No no, tonight is just between us. Mr. Reynolds, would you help me unbutton the back of my dress please? - Now Mrs. Albright. - Oh please, do you really think I intend something improper? - Well, I mean no but... - Then come over here. I wanna show you something. Come come. Undo the back of my dress please. (ominous music) - What the? - Unlace the stitches would you please? - I'm sorry? - Unlace the stitches. (dramatic music) You know what I am don't you? - Yes. - So I've convinced you haven't I? - Yes. Oh God please help me. - No no no, you made your bargain. You know what you might've had, and you know what you've lost. Come. No, crawl. Closer. Now you must give me what I want. Your hand please. (suspenseful music) (pained groans) You may struggle if you like. It won't make any difference. (screaming) (clock ticking) - Why I can't understand it. He must've left early before breakfast. - It's strange. I was up early, I didn't hear him go. - Well he's not here now so he must've left. - He told me he was going to take an early train. - Really? Didn't know there were any trains before noon. - My goodness you're as nervous as a jumping bean. - I'm sorry ma'am, can I get you something? - Oh no no I just wanted a cup of tea. No sit honey sit. - I'm sorry ma'am I'm sorry. Oh that's all right. - Dammit! I'm sorry. - Don't be silly. I've heard much worse. Here let me see. Oh it's nothing but a scratch. Well now my, isn't that interesting. - Ma'am? - Your palm, may I? You know you can learn a great deal about someone by studying their palm. - I went to a gypsy once. She said I'd get rich, but I didn't. - I see you've been keeping a secret. - A secret? - Mmm Hmm. Right there. In your room. Why, you don't know how to read. - I can read fine. - I've hurt your feelings I'm sorry, don't be like that. Would you like to know a secret of mine? I'll tell you. I was older than you are now when I learned to read. - Really? - Yes. It wasn't easy. - I know, sometimes ... - You'd like to be like other young girls wouldn't you? - Smart like them you mean. Yes. - When I was young I wanted so much to be like other girls, but I was slow. They'd laugh at me behind my back. Sometimes to my face. - I know, I hear 'em. I'd do just about anything to be able to not be so stupid. - If that's the way you really feel, then I can help you. Is that the way you really feel? - Yes ma'am. Sometimes I see a smart girl talking about things, talking smart to men and I wish I could just, I don't know I wish I could just kill her and steal her smarts for myself. - Would you like to know my secret? - Yes ma'am. - It's a special book. I always carry it with me. - The words are too big. I can't read those big-- - Yes you can. Concentrate. Look at it hard. You can read them. - A Concise and Illustrated history of The Earth King. Why I read it. Every word. - Take it. Read it. I know you'll like it. - Kathryn have you finished the silverware yet? - I'm afraid I was bothering her. - Oh no problem. Kathryn knows the work she's to do. Don't bother with that there's a spill in the sitting room. Well go on! Get some rags. Hurry up. - [Robert] Gin. - You win again. - Yes, what's the point in even playing with you? Would anyone else care for a game? Mr. Gray? - Oh no thank you. - Miss Lester, would you care to play? Cards I mean. - No thank you. I'll say goodnight. - I think I'll go to bed too. - A strange thing Mrs. Albright. - What's that? - I remember what you said about Will Reynolds wanted to catch an earlier train. - Hmm? - I called the station, there weren't any trains before noon. - Really? Well then I suppose poor Mr. Reynolds had a long wait after all didn't he? - So it seems. - Well, goodnight all. (ominous music) (toilet flushing) - Oh! Sorry. (shushing) - Um. (shushing) - Wait. When she goes to sleep, come to my room. I'll let you fuck me. (mischievous music) (gasping in surprise) (screaming) - What? What? Wait, oh sweet Jesus. My wife, you'll wake the whole house. (shushing) What's wrong? (squealing) My God what's the matter with you? (screaming) No, no no no no, don't! Don't do this to me! (shushing) What did I do? Stop! Stop! (gunshot) (screaming) (gasping and screaming) - Oh, my goodness. What's happened? - He, he, he tried to assault me. Oh my God. (shushing) - Go back to your room. - Call the police. We have to call the police. - No it's all right. Go back to your room. We don't wanna wake the others. - But the shot and I screamed. - It's all right. Go on. - But he's still inside. - I'll be with you. (shushing) (ominous music) Ah, there you are. - That woman. That woman is insane she shot me! - He came into my room he tried to assault me! He tore my nightgown! - She invited me! She's flirted with me ever since she got here! She invited me, she gave me the key and then she shot me because she's insane. - You! You despicable thing! - Oh God! Oh God. - Miss Lester, I think we should move Mr. Delaney out of your room, don't you agree? Now do you think you can help me? - Let me get my robe. - Mr. Delaney, we're going to walk you to my room. - Don't move me. Do you really want your wife to find you here? Then come along. Let's sit him down at the edge of the bed here. Now Miss Lester, go back to your room. - But the police, but we have to call them and what can I do? - Miss Lester, go back to your room. (groaning in pain) - Please, call the doctor. - Mr. Delaney, you might as well know, at the rate you're bleeding you'll be dead in a few minutes. All a doctor will be able to do is sign your death certificate. - Ah Christ! She gave me the key. I swear I didn't try to assault her. Please, get my wife. - Do you want to die? - What? - Do you want to die Mr. Delaney? - What are you talking about you just told me that-- - Isn't this a shocking waste? Wouldn't you like another chance. - What? - Wouldn't you do anything if I could make that bullet hole go away? If I could heal you, if I could save your life, what would it be worth to you? - My life? You're as crazy as she is. - Roll over. - What? - You don't believe me I'll show you. Roll over onto your side. (groaning in pain) - What in God's name are you doing? (liquid squelching) - That's got the bleeding stopped. Look. - What did you do? - Just wound back the bleeding a bit. - But it still hurts. - The bullet is still in there. It has to come out. Do you want me to take it out? - Yes of course! - Well then, what'll you give me? - I don't know. All I have, anything. I'll give you anything. - Good. Lie still please. (yelling in pain) - What is that thing? - What this? I suppose it's just some kind of a fashion. - A fashion? - Yes a fashion. If I offered to cure you by making passes over your stomach, or by shaking a corn rattle, you'd think I was crazy wouldn't you? Now this is much more in keeping with the times, wouldn't you say? Medical, mechanical, a certain scientific quality? Every society has an acceptable form for it's magic Mr. Delaney. Whether it's dead cats and tree stump water or electrolitic catalisis and radium treatments. (groaning in pain) They're all cloaks of course. No one wants to look straight into the eye of the impossible. - That's amazing. How did you do that? - Lie back down please. (whimpering) (screaming) (gasps) (whimpering) (knocking) - Mrs. Delaney, I-- - I cleaned up all the blood in the hallway. - Your husband, he-- - I know what he did. We've got to get this place cleaned up. Do you have a clean sheet, a blanket? - What? - Help me, all the sheets and blankets, everything with blood on it. We'll clean up the carpet afterwards. - I don't understand. - Do what I tell you. Unless you want to go to jail. - Jail? - You know how the world works. What are the police? Men. The judges? Men. The juries? Ah, men! What do you think they'll believe? - What can we do? - Well no one else knows but Mrs. Albright, and she won't tell. My husband is going to cease to exist. - Oh my God! - Robert's still alive but he won't be for long. When we're done here we'll carry him outside into the woods behind the house. Tomorrow morning I'll call the police and tell them that he went out for a walk and never came back. We'll make it look like he was surprised by a thief. - How can you speak about it so calmly? - Speak about it? I've been dreaming about something like this for years! Ever since I realized the filthy thing I'd married. The plans were already there. I just needed something like this to bring them to life. Get undressed. - What? - Look at you, you're covered in blood. Get undressed! Put your clothes over there with the rest. Unless you want the police to undress you. Don't. Your robe's covered in blood. Put it over there with the rest. Go over to the dresser. I need to clean you off. Hurry up. No time to be shy. We've got to be close. Close as sisters. - I've never had a sister. Is it bloody on my back? - It's everywhere. Did he hurt you? - He tore my night dress. He touched me. Touched me. - Turn around. - I'll do it. I'm sorry, sorry! - Is that what you want? - No! I didn't know what I was doing. - I've spent the last 10 years rehearsing my husband's death in my mind. What have you been rehearsing in yours? What do you think about when you're all alone? - Nothing. - What are you afraid of? We're going to be murderers together. What do you want? This is what you want isn't it? Isn't it? - Yes. - More than anything? - Yes. - Then you'll do anything, anything I ask? - Yes. - Will you be mine forever? - Yes. (ominous music) - Do you think he's still alive? - Are you afraid? - It's too late to be afraid. - Oh it's never too late for that. (ominous music) (whimpering) - Robert? Are you all right? - Ellen I'm not blind. I know what I am, I know that I'm not a good man. - [Ellen] That's not true. - I know that I haven't treated you the way that I should, but it's not gonna go on. We're gonna break out of this life. We're gonna have a home and servants and children. We're gonna have the life that we deserve. - We are? - And you are gonna have the husband that you deserve, but we're gonna need courage. Do you have courage? - I don't know. I thought I did once but I just-- - Ellen, look at me. I'm not a good man, I'm weak and I'm vindictive, and I don't know how to love anything. Not even myself. Do you love me? - Yes Robert, you know I do. I've never wanted anything more than your love. - I promise you nothing do you hear me? Knowing that, will you still do what I ask of you? - Yes. - No questions? - No. - Anything for me? - Just tell me what to do. - Mrs. Grove has no bank account. - Are you sure there isn't anything I can do for you? - No no, I'll be all right. - Should I send Kathryn up with the powder? - No thank you Mrs. Grove, I'm just going to lie down. - All right. - I'll try get home a bit early. - I'm sure I'll be fine. - Mr. Delaney, where did you say that Mr. Gray went? - Something about trying to find Miss Lester and Mrs. Albright. Honestly I didn't quite understand him. See you this evening. - Have a good day Mr. Delaney. Oh, Mr. Delaney? - Hmm? - Did you hurt yourself? - Oh, no I just slept on it or something. Good day. - Oh good morning Mrs. Grove. - Well good morning. We missed you at breakfast. - Well I needed some help with some things and Miss Lester was very accommodating. (chuckling) Mrs. Grove, I was wondering if you might be able to help me. - Oh well I don't-- - You see I just have no head at all for money. - For money? - Yes. That's where Miss Lester took me this morning, to see a man at the bank? You see Albert my dear husband, he left me, what are those things called? Pillories. No, um, stocks! (laughter) That's it, yeah I have quite a few of them, and this man at the bank well he said I should put them in some sort of box at the bank. That I should put all my money in the bank, but I don't know. - No you should think twice. Banks fold you know ,and then all your money is gone. - Yes exactly. You see, you know all about it! So I was wondering... - Yes? - Could you advise me? I don't want to impose but it would take such a burden off of me if only someone would just take care of it all for me. - It would be a burden of course, but I know how it is being widowed and all myself. I'd have to have free hand. - Oh of course. Of course I'd never dream of taking charge. Are you busy right now? I could show you what I have in my trunk. Perhaps you could make some sense out of it all for me. - Oh I'm not doing anything really. I could spend a few moments. - Thank you so much. (ominous music) No, this isn't right. I'm just taking advantage of you. You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to put all my money in the bank. I mean everyone does it. - Now now now don't do that, it's no bother for me really. - No I've made up my mind. Why should I push my troubles onto you. - Now no, now I insist. If you feel that you're taking advantage, well we'll work something out. - Are you certain? - Absolutely. I want to do this. We'll make an accommodation. Something that's fair to both of us. - Well I do want to be fair. (laughter) All right. We'll, how did you put it? We'll make an accommodation. - [Mrs. Grove] Are you telling me that you actually went to the police? - You're darn right I did. When Miss Lester didn't show up at her classroom, and no one's seen her since, and there's no sign of Will Reynolds either of course I went to the police. For all the good it did me. - Well, what did they say? - That they didn't have sufficient grounds for action. That they couldn't declare them missing for 48 hours. - And Mrs. Albright is missing too. - I swear I think there's something, something ungodly going on in this house. - Well as soon as Mr. Delaney gets home from work I'm going to lock the door. Mrs. Albright comes home later, she won't be able to get in without waking someone. - I'm going to my room. If she does come back, or Miss Lester does, please wake me no matter what the hour. - Don't worry. Mrs. Albright won't be murdering us in our beds. - I hope you're right. Good evening. - Good evening Mr. Gray. Oh Kathryn, as soon as you're done cleaning up please go to your room. - Yes Aunt Mary. Aunt Mary? - Yes? - Did you hurt yourself? - Stick to your business. (ominous music) (whimpering) - Robert, I was... I was so afraid, it's so late! - There were things I had to take care of. Things I had to arrange. Are you ready? - Yes. - For anything? - I don't understand. - Listen carefully, Mrs. Grove is in the sitting room. I'm going to go there and keep her occupied. While I do, you have to go to her room and get the money. - But I don't-- - Do you love me? - [Ellen] Yes. - Then don't ask questions, just listen. There's a small table in the corner on the far wall. There's a straight razor on top of it. Take the blade and slide it along the top edge of the drawer until you hit a hidden catch. Open the drawer, our money is hidden inside. Take it and put back everything the way you found it. Lock the door and go to our room. - [Ellen] I will. - You know that everything depends on this? If you fail, it would mean prison for both of us. - I won't fail. - You'll do whatever you have to do? - Anything, I will do anything for you. - Here's the key. Wait five minutes, then go. Quietly. (suspenseful music) (gasps) - I thought, I thought Robert was going to-- - I see. Now I know why your husband was so talkative this evening. It was all a plot. I always knew there was something wrong about the two of you. Well my dear, now you're both going to prison. You and your dear husband. - No it was my idea, Robert doesn't know anything about this. - You gave him away yourself. Robert was going to, what? Keep me busy? You will send him to jail with your own words. - No please, I'll do anything. - I'm gonna telephone the police. (suspenseful music) (screaming) (gasping and scuffling) - I'm sorry. Oh my God. Oh my God. (sobbing breaths) - Don't worry dear. (screaming) That part of it's over now. You posed a slightly different problem from the others. All you wanted was love, but I always honor my end of the bargain, and of course I couldn't love you. So in order to get what I wanted, we had to resolve our relationship, like this. - [Mrs. Albright] You see Mrs. Delaney, there are some things one shouldn't do. Not even for love. - I don't understand. - But you will my dear. You will. Come along. Come, come now. Give me your hand. You must. You see, you're mine now. (suspenseful music) (knocking) - Kathryn. Are you all right? - I was, I was asleep. - Kathryn listen to me, we're alone in the house. - What's that sir, what did you say? - Mrs. Grove is gone. Her floor is covered with blood. No one's in Will's room or the Delaney's or Miss Lester's. We're the only ones left. - Left? What do you mean? You said there's blood in Aunt Mary's room? - And in Miss Lester's. - What about the new one? - I didn't try her room. Get dressed. Quickly. We're leaving this house. Now! Quickly now! Cover your eyes. - What is it? Why won't it break? - Kathryn. This is the work of the Devil, and I believe the Devil is in this house tonight, or some servant of the Devil. - You mean Mrs. Albright? - Yes? No no, Kathryn dear our kind invented the cross. - Where are the others? - With me. It's a bit of a disappointment really how easy it was. - Why have you come here? Why choose us? - It's a kind of a test really. For me. Not for you. My master sets me a challenge. Can I win the souls of everyone in a house? - But you haven't won ours yet. - No, not yet. Of course almost always somebody catches on, and that usually makes it more difficult. I knew from the first moment I saw you that you would be a problem, but we will do the best we can. (ominous music) - Still pretending to limp? Why bother, we know what you are. - Oh no, the limp is real. An old war wound. - War wound? What war? - Why our war of course. - [Kathryn] Oh God! - Kathryn, Kathryn! Stop it, stop it! Kathryn stop it! - Jesus she's going to kill us! - No, no, that isn't what she wants. Please Kathryn you must listen! She wants something far more valuable than our lives. She wants our souls do you understand? - Our souls? - Yes. To be with her forever in Hell. - No! - Listen to me! She can not take our souls unless we surrender them. We must resist her. Kathryn, do you fear the Devil? - I don't know! - Well you must know! What use is your life if you buy it with an eternity in Hell? - I'm sorry sir, I'm sorry I just don't know, I don't know! I don't wanna die. (book clatters on floor) (whimpering) (yells in surprise) What is it? - I don't know. One of her servants. (screaming) There, there it is! (dramatic music) (whimpering) (screaming) - It's still alive! (screaming) (glass shatters) - You're gonna have to pay for that Mr. Gray. (sobbing and whimpering) In number five, in Hell alive, thy souls forever in my hands. So go and do as I command. (suspenseful music) (screaming) - Kathryn, candles. We need candles. - That drawer. - Ow! (whimpering) (suspenseful music) Whatever happens remember, God doesn't ask anything of us that we can't do. - It's too late. Too late. (screaming) (stabbing) (yelling in pain) (hissing) - This way Kathryn. (suspenseful music) (screaming and laughter) (yells in pain) (stairs creaking) - Well surely you didn't expect something civilized from me did you Sam? - The Lord is my shepherd I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures. - See that I'm the one who's making you lie down now. - He restoreth my soul-- - Oh yes yes yes, but what about the girl's soul? - The girl? (laughter) - That got your attention didn't it? Better take a look. She's in need of some of your spiritual comfort. (crying) - God please help me! - Don't look away! If everything works out the way you hope, we'll have a martyr here. - She's innocent! She doesn't deserve this! - God please make it stop! Make it stop! (screaming) God please make it stop! (screaming) - What will you give me? - Don't answer her! Don't answer her! - Now Sam, let's be realistic shall we? Kathryn's a nice dull sort of girl, but we both know she isn't cut from the martyr cloth. Maybe you'll be able to endure but as for Kathryn, I'd give her another 10 or 15 minutes. - Oh God make it stop! - My dear, if you want little Miss Lester to stop her games you'll have to ask someone closer. - Please make her stop. - What'll you give me? - Anything, anything please! - Done. - No! - Hmm, not even five minutes. (clucks tongue) Is the human soul growing weaker or is it that people simply can't stand suffering the way they used to? Come my dear. You've made a fool's bargain, but then fools often do don't they? - Wait. I'll make a trade. My soul for hers. - Oh really? Well you certainly think highly of yourself. - Don't play with me! You'll make the bargain. - No, that would be too generous on my part. If I let her go who knows what she may do with her life. She might become a notorious sinner. Would you expect us to deprive ourselves of the pleasure of her company in that event? No, it won't do. Can we limit the bargain? Be a bit more specific? - You release her, no more torture. You don't visit her again. Offer her no more bargains. She leaves alive unbound by you. Her soul her own. Whatever evil she may do after that, that is on her soul. - No more torture. I refrain from killing her. I erase the bargain we just made. She's free to go where she wishes, and I offer her no new bargains. In return, you give me your soul to be lost in my master's shadow for all time. - Yes. - Done! I knew your weakness all along. - What weakness? - Hubris. You thought you could redeem the soul of another. Do you really imagine yourself to be the redeemer? Girl the door's open go where you will. - Go on, don't look back. (ominous music) - Have you finished the book my dear? - Yes. It told me what to do. It told me everything. It was just like the book said. It didn't hurt at all, but I pretended it did. - You were simply marvelous. - Kathryn? - Yes, I always keep my promises. She's free to go where she wishes, but she had already chosen to come with me, and I need make no new bargains because our bargain had already been made. - It's all in here. All about the Earth King, and how he'll make you powerful so you can get back at your enemies. - Am I your enemy? - A friend is someone who can help you. You couldn't. She could. - But let's be completely fair about this now shall we? You can read now can't you Kathryn? - Yes. - And you have already tasted my knowledge. - Yes. - Do you accept me of your own free will? - Kathryn! - Yes. - Do you give yourself to me of your own free will? - [Kathryn] Yes. - Then the deal is done, and I have kept my word. (suspenseful music) - You fool. - You don't know nothing. I'm going to be a queen in Hell with silver robes. You'll see. I bet she'll make you into one of those dolls. - Amazing, it'll actually be a surprise to her. But don't worry, I have a special surprise for you as well. Come come, give me your arm. (suspenseful music) (whimpering and screaming) Oh. Gray imp wake. Gray imp wake. There is work to do for thy master's sake. (whimpering) (ominous music) I love the quiet of the night. The Earth will be a very nice place really. When all is silent. (ominous music) (dogs barking) (ominous music) (MultiCom Jingle)
