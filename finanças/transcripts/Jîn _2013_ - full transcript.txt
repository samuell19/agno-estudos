Bye bye comrade! To Leyla, with love. "Where do I live?" "Which hemisphere do you live on?" "In which part ofTurkey do you live?" "Looking at your atlas, write..." "...the latitude and longtitude of where you live..." Girl, what's going on? Oh, look at that beauty! Tell me, what are you doing here? You, son of a dog, didn't you recognize me? I took bread from you... Do you want me to rip your chest now! I did not, honestly, sister, I really didn't. I swear... (Kurdish) Sorry comrade no more apples left. - Where are you going, sister? - Towards Karapinar. Where is that? I'm going to the border, near Nakkas... Yes, that's where I'm going... I'm not going to cross through it. I'll drop you off at the intersection. What are you going there for? My grandmother is sick, I'll see her. Where are you from? From up there, Varatli. It's dangerous around here, you know! God forbid, I'm never around this area at this hour... ...but I had to change the clutch disks... I know; of course! I missed the bus. No, thanks. How old are you? 17. Oh, my youngest daughter is 16. Your name? Leyla. My daughter's name is Leyla as well! Fancy that! God knows, I didn't know whether I should stop or not. It could easily have been bandits or a trap... Fancy that: Leyla! - So, do you study? - No, I had to quit. What does your dad do? I don't have a dad. Did he pass away? May God rest his soul. Don't get on anything other than a bus. Especially a truck! Take this... take it, I said! Thank you mister. Godspeed. Say hi to Leyla for me! Identifications gentlemen! - Where are you headed? - Nakkas, officer. - You? - Nakkas, for work. - What work? - To hoe. That's my sister, She is going to hoe as well. You? Me too, to hoe... (Kurdish) Did you run away from home? No sister, my granny's sick. I'm going to see her... Are there buses leaving for lzmir here? No. You need to go to Mersin first. The offices are back there. Thank you, mister. When is the bus to Mersin? Early in the morning. - How much is a ticket? - 40 liras. If you don't have enough money, we can work something out... Come, take a seat... Have some tea... - (Kurdish) What's your name? - Jin. Yours? Zivan. I repeat, women will hoe for 25 liras a day... Men will clear rocks for 35 liras a day. The barrack in the back is for the women. Get started immediately. Who are you? I came to work too. Our neighbor's daughter, she's with me. Fine. Go ahead. Hurry-up! You, wait! You! Don't let them fool around. I'll clear stones as well. That's men's work... Still I can do it. - How old are you? - 17. 17. What's your name? Leyla. Do you have an ID? No, I forgot it in the village. Never mind, we'll see... One more thing... Do you pay daily? My grandma is sick, I'll buy her medicine... It's paid weekly here. But we'll work it out... I like you... Go on now. What! Leylaaa, look here! Go get Leyla! Come here! I talked to the the property owner... He doesn't want workers without ID! He's right... You know, there are terrorists and such. But I insisted over and over. 'She's fine' I said... He said; 'Then I don't care, she's your responsibility' I said; 'Fine, she's under my protection.' So, take it easy! Thank you. Oh... and, one more thing... Tomorrow evening I'll give you your money... Two days worth. Don't say anything to the others! I'm only doing it for you! Thank you. Come and see me tomorrow after dinner. Fuck off! Welcome dear, come inside. No, I shouldn't. I came to get my pay. Really, like a thief... No way... Come inside. Look, the sugar is over there. Reach out and get one. You are so slender, like a doe, beware of the evil eye! So you are from the same village as them? - How many siblings are you? - 7. - How many girls? - 4 Are you the prettiest? Such slender ankles, such cotton feet! If you are not going to pay, I'd better go. You are so untamed! Don't you understand anything from kindness and compliments! Just money! 50, 55... 65, and that's 70. Take it. Come here! Don't touch my body! I'll tear you to pieces. Why such terrorist rant! I'll give you a good life! I swear I will... Don't touch, you son of a dog! I'll rip you apart! Fucking terrorist! You screw with those in the mountains, and you think you can be a lion to us. Did the bus leave? No, sister, there's at most an hour. Have a seat. I'll tell you when it arrives. (Kurdish) What happened to your face? A dog attacked me. How did you get away? I attacked back, it got scared and ran away. - Was it big? - It was. If it's big, then why would it be afraid of you? A dog cannot cope with a human, even if it's big! If it attacked me, I would run away. If you don't run away, you scare it more. IDs everyone! IDs please! I forgot it at home, I can go get it... Keep going! Girl, don't you understand any Turkish at all? I swear by the Koran, my son is doing his military service now... Old man, enough... give it a rest! Who did you fight with? What are these wounds? Commander, please allow me to go and get my ID. Soldier, take this old man inside and send me Erdal. You have very smart eyes. Ask her who she is, where her ID is. (Kurdish) Where are you from? Don't you have an ID? If you don't speek, you'll get into trouble. Where did they stop you? They took me off the bus. I was going to my granny. Oh, look at that beautiful voice of yours! Your ID? It's in the village. - Which village are you from? - Gevez. What district does it belong to? How did she get those wounds? A dog attacked. She's lying. Those are no dogs work. Commander, I think she must have run away from her home... Let me question her in private. Commander, we received radio information. They cornered a group of terrorists below the river... One of them died, one is injured heavily... They are sending the injured terrorist here. Lieutenant said,'don't let him die, rescue him, he'll be very useful' Put her alongside the old man for now. Come. End me up. Oh, sweet mother of God! He's gone. Take it away. (Kurdish) Why are you crying? Tell me who you're running from? See, I saved you. Ifl had said 'maybe she's a terrorist', who knows where you'd be now! Be a good girl and I'll get you out of here. Old man, can't you look elsewhere? You're pissing me off! How pretty you are! Oh, sweet mother of God! Commander, what shall we do with these two? Just release them. Get out, get out! What the hell are you looking at? I'm sick of you all! Get the fuck out! My men are dying out there! Don't, sister! (Kurdish) We're looking. Water... just water... Thank God, you were the one I came across! I still have 7 months duty... Ifl survive... Do you understand me? My arm, my arm... Thank you. I came here from Çanakkale... Do you know Çanakkale? No, you don't... See... ...these are my siblings... ...and this is my mother... I never saw my father. I never saw my father either! They took him away when I was just 2. He didn't even have a gun. He never returned. May he rest in peace. What peace! He doesn't even have a grave! How long have you been in the mountains? Stand up! Stand up! - Sister, I never killed anyone. - Stand up! Your leg is not bad. You'll leave in the morning. You have no other chance. God bless you. God bless you. Follow the route I told you. Don't stop. You should make it to the river in 6-7 hours. Take this. Sister, I may die on my way... Please allow me to call my mother. Keep it short. Otherwise they'll find your place. Very short. Mama, did I wake you up? I'm fine. I am calling secretly on my watch... Give me your blessing, mama... (Kurdish) Mama, my one and only... No, I didn't. I decided not to go... Never mind... Give my love, my hugs to everyone. Take it. You can keep it. What can I do with it? Off you go! I hope we meet again someday... Say, at a cafe... I wish you would tell me your name! My name is, Jin! Give me your blessing!
