Mrs. harwood. Mrs. harwood, ma'am. Oh, there you are. I've been searching all over for you. You know the deck's not the place for a Lassie this weather. Thumbing your nose at the elements. I find it exhilarating. Oh, exhilarating be hanged. I want your help, ma'am. My help? In what way? Well, it's the malaria cases. The fever's mounting. Will you help me to fight it? I'm not a nurse, doctor. But you're from Jamaica. You've had experience of this among the natives. You can help your own folk now. Will you come below, ma'am? - I'm sorry, doctor. Excuse me. - Mrs. harwood. My husband died of the fever. I've just finished nursing him. I need rest. You're a dedicated woman. You're a missionary's widow. Oh, I know you need rest, but, before god, ma'am, I'm telling you, this is neither the time nor the place to be thinking about yourself. You're an atheist, doctor. What do you know of god? Doctor! Where are the patients? Now take this. How ill am I? You'll soon be well. Go to sleep. Your hand feels so good. So good. Don't go. Please, don't go. Please. - I have to. There are others. - No, no. We must hurry, please. We must keep moving. They'll never find you in London... That's all right. Yes. Everything will be all right. Promise you'll take care of me. Yes, I promise. I promise. Now, go to sleep. - There's nothing to worry about. - Nothing to worry about. Nothing to worry about. Good morning. Don't move, please. I should like to paint you just like that, staring at england. Oh, Mr. bellis. How, uh, how do you feel? Weak as a rat, but grateful. Eternally grateful to you. - I owe you my life. - Oh no. Dr. krylie... Dr. krylie has many gifts. But he doesn't have your hands. I know I must have talked incessantly during my delirium. I hope I said nothing foolish. Nothing, uh... Nothing. Thank you. One never knows. - You eager to be home? - Yes. You have friends, relatives, to meet you? No. We were many years in Jamaica, my husband and I. It was quite impossible to keep in touch. Oh, then, forgive me but, uh, where will you go? - To minton street. - Minton street? It's in Kensington, just off the high street. I have a small property there. My late husband left it to me. Property”? How fortunate. Oh, nothing imposing, of course. It's quite small, really. Really very small. I think... Again, Mr. bellis? Yes. May I lean against your shoulder? Of course. - You sit here. I'll get some quinine. - No. No, thank you. I feel much better. Goodbye, Mrs. harwood. - But, Mr. bellis. - I shall never forget your kindness. Perhaps, we shall run into each other again. I do hope so. Goodbye, and thank you a thousand times. Good afternoon, Mrs. harwood. How fortunate to find you at home. May I come in? Yes. Yes, do. - How did you find me? - You told me the street, and an obliging greengrocer gave me the number. You must forgive my appearance, I was not expecting visitors. I'm intruding, I know, but I'm afraid I must ask for your assistance again. Oh, what is it? Mrs. harwood, I'm homeless. - Homeless? - Quite. But surely, there are many hotels. For those with money, yes. I have very little. I paint, you know. I hardly know what to say. It shouldn't be difficult to find something suitable. I'm afraid you misunderstand me. I was hoping to stay here. Oh, that'd be out of the question. You have a vacancy sign in your window. Yes, I know, but you see, I'm a widow and you're... I'm going to put my neuralgia to bed, Mrs. harwood. And I must say, I should appreciate absolute quiet. My lodger, miss shoebridge. She teaches piano at the high school. - Only to the girls, of course. - A perfect chaperone. That is, of course, unless you find the idea of my presence distasteful. Oh, no. Quite the contrary. Then may I see the room? I... I doubt if it will be what you want. You see, it's really most ordinary. I like it for that. Isn't that a beech? And an elm? We've crocuses in the back garden. And daffodils. Really? No acacia or pimento or mango? - Why did you say that? - Jamaica. - You're homesick? - No, Mrs. harwood! I hated the islands. I loathed the exile. I longed for england with a desperation you can never know. Oh, yes, I can. I hated Jamaica, too. I thought if I didn't come back, I should die. And yet I don't know. London isn't home, not really. You're right. It's changed. Or we have. Yes. We are alike, aren't we? Our own special kind of loneliness. Goodbye, Mrs. harwood. I'm sorry to have taken up so much of your time. You... you don't like the room? Oh, enormously! It's 12 shillings a week. Bed and breakfast. I should like to make all arrangements in advance. - Oh, that isn't necessary. - Oh, please. As a token of good faith. I'm sure it'll be a very happy association. We have so much in common. Yes. Oh, don't come down. I'll let myself out. Goodbye. Sit still now, virgie, while mommy combs you. That's a good girl. Hold still, now! Mark! All right, all right. You were so long, I was worried. Are you in trouble? - How long have they been there? - I don't know. I don't like this. I'm afraid for you. - Afraid for yourself, you mean. - For us both, Ken! My name is Mark, not Ken. How many times must I tell you? Oh, Mark's so common. You might've used a little bit more imagination. Monty's nice. Or Albert. Why don't you call yourself Albert? What are you doing? I'm moving. Yes, I've taken a room what are you talking about? I'm a little weary of your attic, my dear, and I'm also weary of our friends in bow street. Well, it'll be the same wherever you go! Not in the house of the most reputable widow in London. - A widow! - Yes, and a missionary to boot. You're sure it's not queen Victoria? She's just as safe, and just as respectable. What do you care about respectability? Nothing whatever. I do care about my skin, though. Mark, I do hate your going. Oh, it won't be for long. But I've only just got you back. Oh, stop sniveling. Do you have any money? What do you think? You're a bad liar. How much? Two quid. But I need it... Give it to me. But what am I supposed to live on, sweet lavender? Here. Give me half. At least half. You don't need it. You can make more. I can't. It's not as easy modeling as it used to be. They say the June's gone out of my juno. Then get a little fatter and they can use you for Venus. Don't go, darling. Don't go tonight. Please. An idiot would know you were there, my dear Mark. Your teeth are too white. If you wish to hide, don't open your mouth. - I hardly expected to see you here. - Why not? I'm on excellent terms with the police. The police seem curiously ill-informed. - Tell me. How did you... - Through the cellar next door, and I'm leaving the same way. - They are not very bright. - Nor are they very stupid. Your homecoming appears to have caused them considerable embarrassment. And you, my dear friend. How does it affect you? You've been some time paying your respects. Well, I... I've only just learned you were back. Yes, and then... My unbounded delight was tempered only by my desire for your safety. How ardent, how very ardent, when one remembers that it was I and not you who was forced to run for Jamaica. - Yet it was you... - Let us say it was both of us. Undoubtedly that would be the opinion of the court. And not to put too fine a point upon it, we should both hang. That is a prospect I'm prepared to go to some pains to avoid. Yes, but not at my expense. Let us have this perfectly clear, Edgar. Whatever happens to me happens to you. - Two pints of brown ale. - Right, sir. Always rooftops and always rain. Such a bore. You need the exercise, you're much too fat. You seem to be bursting with news. - What are your plans? - They're wrapped up in yours. The American market in old masters is positively at its peak. With your talent, we can fake a nice little line in rembrandts, or rubens, and live in comfort for the rest of our lives. No. I'm the best painter in england. I refuse to destroy the one thing in the world I believe in. I've told you that before. Unfortunately, the art dealers don't share your enthusiasm for your work, my dear fellow. I do not understand you, Mark. You steal pictures because you have to eat. Well, why not fake them? Are theft and forgery so far removed? Your artistic opinions don't interest me. You know nothing at all about pictures, except how to dispose of them in your rather dubious way. Oh, very well. The Van honthorst canvases return from the louvre to lord Millbrook's on the 14th of next month. Good. We shall visit lord Millbrook on the 14th. Oh no, not me. No, no, positively no. Last time, there was blood! One paper openly referred to it as murder. Last time, I left everything to you. This time, I shall plan it myself. To the Millbrook collection which we shall collect on the 14th. Unless they collect you first. Unless they collect us first. Cress sandwiches and ginger biscuits. I must say I'm getting very tired of bread and butter for my tea. Mr. bellis has been ill. His appetite needs stimulating. Personally I don't eat enough to keep a bird alive. You should. The idea. Ceylon! The very idea. Seems nothing but fetch and carry for your gentleman friend. Wipe you mouth, miss shoebridge. There's a piece of watercress on your chin. How lovely they are. They're so yellow this year, aren't they? So much more yellow when you wear them. That color becomes you. You should wear it more often. L... I've been looking at some of your new paintings. You have? Tell me about them. I'm afraid I don't know very much about art. Why not? You know about other things. You're warm, sensitive, and kind to strangers. They're unusual, aren't they? They're not at all like photographs. I don't believe paintings should be. Others agree with me, but not in england. Here, they're steeped in the dry rot of the past. I'm sure they'll sell one day. Yes. The day after my death. As miss shoebridge would say, "so sad. He was quite, quite brilliant. Lived over my head for years." You're in high spirits today, Mr. bellis. You too. You know, I've never heard you laugh before? More important, I've never seen you laugh. You're a different person. Different? In what way? Usually you're so... Forgive me but, so reticent. When you laugh, you're gay, you're very gay indeed. I'd like to paint you. Me? Oh, surely not. Your hair is so lovely. I'd like to see it down. Down around you shoulders. No. Please. Nobody need know. Come into the light. I think I'll try a sketch first. May I? If you really want to, Mr. bellis. That's all for today. Light's gone. - Don't you want to see it? - I've told you, no. It's almost finished. I never want to see it. Come here! I want to know what you think. Once when I was a girl, this is the way I thought I was. I really haven't done you justice. Your eyes are deeper, your skin is whiter. But I have got your carriage, the way you hold your head. - That part's rather good, don't you think? - Do you really see me like that? You are like that. It's the dress. The girl who gave it to me in Jamaica had been married in it. She said it would make me happy and gay. Has it? I've never dared try it on until now. Well, how do you like yourself? Olivia! Olivia! Why did you have to paint me like that? Why? - I paint only what I feel and what I know. - It was deliberately cruel. Deliberate, yes. Cruel, no. My life was to be rich and full and complete. I planned it all when I was young. Oh, you wouldn't have known me when I at school. I was the leader of everything. I danced the best. I even looked the best. Why did you have to bring it all back to me? Everything that I wanted to be. Everything... that I'm not. I don't know why I'm talking like this. I want to know about you, Olivia. I want to know all about you. Don't. You're not afraid of me. You're afraid of yourself. You're sure the pictures are going to be crated? How else would they travel? Well, I shall pray desperately for fog. It's helpful, but not vital. You know, actually I shall be doing england a great public favor by getting rid of the monstrosities. History will thank me. Only if history knows the truth about you. In which case... In which case I and my pictures will hang together. Charming thought. Are you nervous, Edgar? Relax. The police have long since given up looking for me. And as far as they're concerned, minton street might just as well be in Australia. Relax. The immediate future seems to me dark and forbidding. Kids had a nice time on the ride. What are you worried about? We've been at it all... Stand just where you are, gentlemen. If you'd relieve the caretaker of his keys, we'll lock these gentlemen in. I'm sorry for the inconvenience. It was unavoidable. Now, get over there! - You too! - You can't do that... Get quiet. It'll save a lot of unpleasantness. Don't shoot, you fool! Run for it! It's nearly three o'clock. I brought you lunch. Leave it. - Mark? - Yes. You were out all night. Where did you go? I couldn't sleep, so I went walking. Why didn't you call me? Why should 1? I heard you come in. It was after six. I couldn't sleep until you came in. I'm sorry. What is it, Mark? We're out of luck, Olivia. Something I depended on has fallen through. - Well, only temporarily, I'm sure. - No, permanently this time. I haven't any money. No prospect of any. I haven't a sou. I have to get away. Away? Yes. Australia, South Africa. Somewhere. No, Mark, no. We'll not be parted now. What do you suggest? I've never really loved a man before. Nor been loved in return. I've never known what it was. Now, I know. Nothing shall take it from me. Nothing! Eat your lunch. Dear Susan... I have but lately returned from the west indies, where I was widowed by the plague that swept the islands. You're my only friend in england, and I've longed to see you. I should like to come to your house, if I may, to renew the friendship that was once so dear to both of us. Mrs. harwood, madam. I understand she's expected. Not by me. - Susan? - Yes. - Please, please show her in. - Yes. Rogers, who is this woman? A very old friend. The widow of a missionary from Jamaica. - She wrote to me, and I asked her to call. - Without your husband's knowledge? I didn't want to bother him since he's been so ill. I'm sure he wouldn't mind. We were such great friends. We used to have such good times at school together. School days are over. A missionary's widow is not a suitable companion for the wife of a prospective peer. Show this person about her business, Rogers. No! No! Very well... Oh, please. Please. He's been so lll. Let him sleep. I'm fully aware of my son's illness. I'm also aware of the reasons for it. Please. Oh, please, please. Olivia! Susan, my dear. Oh, how good it is to see you. Why didn't you write to me earlier? Oh, I'm so sorry about your bereavement. You must tell me everything about Jamaica. I think it's so wonderful of you to have given your life to god. But then, you always were the unselfish and generous one, weren't you? Even at school. School was fun, wasn't it, Olivia? And such a long, long time ago. It is a long time, Susan. Oh, you've still got the little locket I gave you. How dear of you. It helped remind me of you. This, and your letters. I kept every one. I believe I have them still. You're joking, aren't you? No, I'm not. - You mean you really do have them? - Yes. But Olivia, I said things in them that I didn't mean. - You know I didn't mean them. - Of course I know. Why have you still got them? Because they were yours. Like a breath of home. Only because of that? Yes. Well, now you really must dispose of them, mustn't you? If you wish. The moment I get home. Thank you. You've never met my husband, have you? He's quite marvelous. So distinguished. Everybody said he's bound to be given a title. - Won't that be wonderful. - Wonderful. Do have some tea. Will you pour for yourself? I'm afraid I'm a little nervous today. Oh, is anything the matter? I'm so worried about Henry. He's been so ill. - Oh, I'm sorry. What's the matter with him? - It's his heart. He's been to the best doctors in Harley street in Vienna, but nobody can stop these terrible attacks. Oh, don't worry, Susan. I'm sure he'll recover. You're so strong, Olivia. I envy you your strength. You envy me? My dear Susan, how very, very odd. Is something wrong? No, not really. Susan, I'm going to ask you a favor. Anything, Olivia. Anything. A friend of mine, a person of great worth and talent, is in debt and I have no means of helping him. And I was wondering if you could possibly... I have no money. It's all in Henry's hands. You see, I understand so little about those things, and he's so capable. I'm sure he his. It was hard to ask you. Let's not say any more about it. You're not angry with me, are you, Olivia? You know I'd give it to you if I had it, don't you? You know I would. Oh, let's not embarrass each other any further. I do have 20 pounds! 20 pounds that I saved from the housekeeping money. No, please. I couldn't possibly... I'll go and get it. I insist that you take it. Where's you friend, Susan? Is she gone? Not yet, Henry. I didn't mention her coming because I didn't want to bother you. See anyone you like, of course, but I think I might be told. I've learned to expect very little from you, Susan. It seemed unimportant. Really it did. Oh, Henry, it's been so wonderful for me to talk to her. If you could only realize your responsibilities. - Perhaps in time... - I will try, Henry. I will try. Give it to me. What? - What do you mean? - Give it to me. Henry, I assure you that I... Now go and say goodbye to your friend. There. I wish it were more. Oh, thank you, Susan. I'll pay you back the first moment I can. I... I really feel ashamed. Oh, no! Please look on it as a gift. After all, you and I are... You and I are friends. What's the matter”? What's happened? It's Henry. He's terribly upset. Oh, I am sorry, Susan. I shouldn't have let you do it. I do hope I haven't caused any fr... Oh, no, it isn't the money. It's just that he's very harsh, very, very harsh. Sometimes I think I can't... Is there anything I can do to help? - Yes, there is. There is. - Well, tell me. If I could talk to you sometimes. But of course. Olivia. Come and stay here with me. Please! Come and stay with you? But I have my own house. I don't think I can do that. Really I don't. Will you think about it? At least think about it. I'm afraid it's quite impossible. But we'll meet again, Susan. Make it soon. Dear Olivia, make it very soon. Goodbye, dear. And again, thank you. - Mark! - Yes. Mark, where are you? Up here. Come down a moment. - What is it? - Come quickly. There! 20 pounds. I'm sorry it isn't more because they're very rich, and they could afford it, but her husband keeps control of her money. - And she's afraid of him. - Who is? Oh, Susan Freeman. Mrs. Henry Courtney. She gave it to me. We were at school together. What does this mean? It means you won't have to go to Australia or anywhere else now, doesn't it? You know, all my life I've known women, Olivia, but I've known no other woman like you. And I've known no other man. Well! With all her fine house and jewels and luxury, Susan hasn't what I have. What you have, my dear, is a penniless painter who allows you to borrow from your friends. Oh, 20 pounds means little to Susan. Poor Susan. So pampered. Such a fool. She asked me to come and stay with her. - Really? - Uh-huh. Yet I felt she was half afraid of me. - Of you, why? Why of you? - It's too ridiculous. These are Susan's. I got them in Jamaica. - Dull reading I'll wager. - Oh, no. Full of confidences and revelations. I promised her I'd destroy them. What are they? Revelations, school-girl chatter, or... No, Mark, I can't tell you. They're not for strangers. Am I a stranger? Not to me, but to Susan. Mark! Mark, what are you doing? Nothing interests me more than what one woman writes to another. Mark, give them back to me! Now please listen to me, Olivia. In any relationship between a man and a woman, there's one cardinal rule for success: No secrets. It must be all, or nothing. Mark, you know I can't bear it when you talk like that. Darling. Well! I must say, I've had just about enough. I'm leaving the house this instant. I shall send for my boxes in the morning. Good afternoon. But you don't understand, miss shoebridge. Indeed. I'm a respectable woman, Mrs. harwood, and I always thought you were, but what's been going on this last month has convinced me that you're possessed of the devil. Mark, what can we do? - You can't stay here now. - Why not? Perhaps if I run after her and tell her... Olivia, what we're doing isn't wrong. But it is, Mark, it is. Darling, we love each other. When things are better for both of us, we'll... You can't stay here now. Very well. I shall leave at once. Where, Mark? I don't know. I'll find somewhere. I'll pack my things. I can't let you go. I couldn't live without you. Not for an instant. - It could always be like this. - Please, god. I know a place in France. It's near the sea. Merville, it's called. There's a villa. It can be ours, Olivia. - Ours? - Yes. "Dearest Olivia, how happy I am. About an hour ago, I saw John again, and I know, now, my affections are reciprocated. If only I'd met him before I married Henry." Susan Courtney. Sir John curle. The key to merville. What do you mean? That Henry Courtney, esquire, queens council, would gladly give a thousand pounds to have these letters in his pocket. And if the attachment between the young Mrs. Courtney and the gallant sir John were to be encouraged, the possibilities would be endless. And that the first step is for Mrs. Howard to accept the invitation of Mrs. Courtney to stay with her, and that once firmly established in the household... Give me those letters! Don't you think we have a right to a life together? There are other ways. Name one. A missionary's widow. A painter before his time. We belong among the rejected. We belong to each other. Isn't that enough? Hardly. This is our escape. Don't you recognize it? Our opportunity. Lose it and we lose each other. Mark. I won't starve, Olivia. Mark, I've known from the beginning. Oh, I've known lots of things. But I pushed them to the back of my mind because I loved you. And because of that I've done things that are against my nature, against everything that I believe. Do this one thing and we're safe. Darling, all your life you denied yourself. You've devoted yourself heart, mind, and body to the service of others. You've been good and kind and generous. But what have you to show for it? Today, poverty, misery, loneliness. Tomorrow, another miss shoebridge. Stay here if you want to, and die, wretchedly. Or come with me. Come with me and live. I've told you, Mrs. harwood, we are not continuing the mission in Jamaica. But there must be something else. There's need for the word of god everywhere. I sometimes think we need a mission in regent street. But we are without means. I must get away from england, Mr. Watson. It's desperately important. I have here a letter from Jacob Simmons. You remember him? Oh, yes. He went out to the transvaal. A worthy man, Mrs. harwood. He has contributed yeoman's service in moving the mission from nquthu to Pretoria, despite the death of his dear wife six months ago. - Now he asks for aid. - Oh, yes? He is anxious to marry again. - Marry again? - Yes. I was wondering. You say your position is desperate. Oh, I... I hadn't thought of... remarrying. There's no other way. May I... may I think about it? Of course. Of course. Thank you. - Good night, Mrs. harwood. - Good night. Please sit down. I asked you to come here instead of my house because I want to talk to you privately. You've accepted my wife's invitation to stay with us for a week or two. Why yes, I... I hope you don't object. On the contrary. My wife thinks very highly of you. Susan and I are old friends from our school days, though life has treated us rather differently since then. Mrs. harwood, I should like to engage you as my wife's companion, at a salary of 75 pounds a year. I was asked as a guest. I hadn't expected payment. I should expect certain services in return. Since you put it on that basis, I... I think the salary should be a little bit more. Do you? You, um... You take lodgers. A miss shoebridge and a Mr. bellis. Your house is mortgaged, and you recently made another loan on it. I think 75 pounds a year will do very well for the moment. What would my duties be? To look after Susan, to be with her constantly, to be responsible for her to me. You see, my wife drinks more than is good for her. A good deal more. - How long has this been... - Over a year. Mrs. harwood, I must talk to you in confidence. I've always wanted to perpetuate my name. My wife has unfortunately been unable. She's been treated by various doctors. One of them suggested that Sherry might have a tonic effect. Her habit is growing stronger every day. It must be cured, or I shall be forced to have her committed to a sanatorium. Oh, I'm shocked, Mr. Courtney. I believe you can help us if you will. - I will do what I can. - Thank you. Mark, dearest, Susan is depending on me more and more. She gave me a lovely dress today. Henry is cold and distant, but he tolerates me because I'm helping Susan. And in a funny way, Susan is helping me. Today, she's going to dress my hair the way they're wearing it in Paris. My darling, you were right. It isn't as difficult as I thought it would be. I'm beginning to enjoy it. I can't wait for you to see me in my new clothes. - Mark. - Yes. Do you love me? I adore you. That's not the same thing. No. Do you love her? I'm not sure. I might. I said, I might. Well, what does that mean? Well, it means I'm capable of emotions I distrust. And I don't like it. I don't like it at all. You don't like what? Would you like a gold chain with a little locket on the end? - Has it got a Jewel in it? - No, no Jewel. I'd like it just the same. Now I really feel I'm your girl. You're all the girl I want or need. Mark, I want to be with you always. You will be soon. A few more weeks, and then... - America? - America. Oh, I do so want to go to Ohio! - I've got a cousin in Ohio. - Darling, kitty. You've no idea how disinterested I am in your cousin in Ohio. - Goodbye. - Yeah, what's the hurry? I have to go out. Oh... It's always like this. - When shall I see you again? - Soon. Tomorrow, I'm gonna buy myself a coat, with a hood for traveling. A green one. Will you like that? - If it doesn't cover your face. - Oh, Mark. You say things so prettily! But I never quite know what's going on inside your head. One day, I'll tell you. You may not like it. Goodbye, Mark. - Morning, John. - Good morning, ma'am. - Oh, how lovely, ma'am. - From the garden. - They match your cheeks. - Thank you. Oh, Alice. I'm going out tonight. Bring my things to Mrs. Courtney's room. - Yes, ma'am. - Right on the bed. And so, dear John... "And so, dear John..." I'm writing to you... In the hope that we may see each other again. I pray with all my heart it may be soon. Thank you, Olivia. Thank you, Alice. Thank you. Olivia? How shall I sign it? Why not, "as ever"? "As ever." And now, the envelope. Sir John curle. L6 Albany, piccadilly, London. I'll post it myself. I'm going out. Must you? Oh, why? I told you this morning. Private business. What's the matter? It's Sunday, and Henry's at home all day, and I... You can stay in your room until dinner. I shan't be late. - Promise? - I've said so. Now give me the letter, and try not to worry about nothing. Henry's a man. He needs to be handled, that's all. It's been a new life since you came here, Olivia. Somebody to talk to, and somebody that I can trust. That's good. - You look wonderful. - Thanks to you. Oh, madam, Mr. Courtney would like to see you. - He's in the conservatory. - Thank you. Oh, Rogers, there will only be Mr. and Mrs. Courtney in for dinner. - I shall be out. - There'll also be Mrs. Courtney senior, madam. Antimony, isn't it? How do you know? We used it on the islands to kill insects. Tarantulas mostly. I have some experience with drugs. Really? Odd interest for a woman. You sent for me? Your report, please, Mrs. harwood. I've nothing to report. Your wife's health is improving. Her spirits are not what I would wish. Susan needs to go out more. To meet more people. It would do her good. I'm not interested in social functions. But you are interested in curing your wife, aren't you? Mrs. harwood, you were engaged as a companion, not as a diagnostician. Susan is a woman, Mr. Courtney. I expect you think it trite and foolish of us women to want these things, but we do. What women want is one thing. What's good for them is another. I'm sure you know best. So sorry. Thank you so much. - Mark. - Olivia. Oh! To be with you and to feel you close. I'm alive again. Has it been difficult? Only because without you, I'm nothing. You have changed a little. Your eyes are bright and shining. You're more beautiful than ever. I changed, my darling, the first moment I saw you. I know that now. Mark, I wish it were over. Soon, very soon now. A present from Courtney? Uh-huh. From his private garden. I picked them myself. - With permission? - Without. Oh. Quite the mistress of the house already. I should like to be. Oh, it's a lovely house. Tell me about Susan. Did you manage to, uh... Mark, tell me you like my dress. I think it's lovely. I changed for you. You're a different person. Absolutely transformed. Susan gave it to me. Gave you the money for it, you mean? No, it's hers. She has no money of her own. Only a small personal allowance. Oh. Oh, really? Nothing else? Nothing, except a few bonds. Bonds? What are they? - Do you like my hat? - Oh, I adore it. It's lovely. But about these bonds. Exactly what are they? They're kimberleys. Several thousand pounds' worth, I think. Negotiable? Mark, I don't know about these things. Well, I do. Bring them next time, will you? Uh-huh. We'll celebrate our reunion. Oh, Mark! What about jewelry? Trinkets, mostly. Lockets and pins. And an emerald brooch I rather fancy myself. No letter yet? Letter? What letter? - Oh, now, Olivia, I asked you... - Oh! Do you mean this? - Was it difficult? - Not very. I told you she was a fool. I'll post it on my way back. No, no, no, not this one. - Copy. - A copy? - But surely the handwriting... - Will be identical. I have a friend who's highly talented. - You leave it to me. - Mark, I don't understand. Darling, you don't have to understand. You don't have to understand anything except that I love you. Oh, madam. Mrs. Courtney has been asking for you. I think perhaps you'd better go up. Thank you, Rogers. Oh, Olivia, where have you been? - I needed you. - What is it? Oh, I hate him! How I hate him! Oh, really, Susan. I left Henry in a perfectly amiable mood. What's happened to upset you? Now stop sobbing and tell me. He's had an attack. The doctor's with him now. But it wasn't my fault. I couldn't help it. Shh. Susan, pull yourself together now. Pull yourself together. It'll be quite all right. Now, sit down here and start from the beginning. Tell me all about it. It was just after I came upstairs. His mother had gone to her room. And he came in here and put his arms around me, and kissed me, and... Well, go on. I pushed him away. And then suddenly, he got red in the face and had trouble breathing. And he collapsed on the floor, and I-i-1 just stood there and I wished he would die. Oh, nonsense, Susan. You didn't wish anything of the kind. You were just so terrified, you didn't know what to do. No. I wished he would die. I still do. Now listen, Susan. Don't let anybody come in here. Susan, Henry's asking for you. He's very ill, go to him. - But isn't the doctor in there? - Dr. Cunningham has gone. Henry has dismissed him. Is there anything I can do? I'm not a nurse, but I have some experience of illness, especially in the cases of high blood pressure. How do you know this is a case of high blood pressure? Come with me. Cunningham gone? Is that fool gone? Yes, Henry, he's gone. Get pound, I told you to get pound. I sent for him. I asked for Susan. What's she doing here? I think I can help. I have some medicine, a drug we used in Jamaica. It relieves the heart. You are not to doctor my son. What is this drug? Something the natives made up. My husband said it resembled a German drug that he knew about, but was very much better. Do you have some here? Yes, in my room. Get it. Henry, I beg you not to do this. You know what Cunningham said. Did he tell you? No, but don't distress yourself. He said we could never have a son. You knew that, unless you marry again. He said it was I, not she. You understand? L, not she. He doesn't know. He can't know. There's a French doctor near vichy. I'm going to him as soon as I can get up. Now get Dr. pound. Good morning, nurse. Good morning, Mr. Courtney. Good morning. Mrs. harwood, thank you for your aid last night. Oh, not at all. Your remedy was a great help. Don't take it away. Well, I hope you won't be needing it again. I'm going to vichy tonight. I shall leave my wife in your care. If you wish to go out occasionally, both of you, it may not do any great harm. Thank you. Five hundred pounds, sir. Thank you. There's a ready market for kimberley shares, Mr. bellis. We shall be glad to handle all you can provide. It's quite possible my client will be willing to dispose of more of them. I shall be in touch with you. Pardon my curiosity, sir, but can you now disclose your client's identity? No, he still wishes to remain anonymous. Financial reverses, you understand? Good afternoon, smathers. Good day, Mr. bellis. Do you see him? No, not yet. Olivia, are you sure he will come? Well, he wrote that he would. I see no reason for him to change his mind. There's lady Louise. Now she'll tell Henry that I've been here. Oh, there's no need to worry. Mrs. harwood. It is Mrs. harwood, isn't it? Don't you remember me? Why, of course, Mr. bellis. We crossed together from Jamaica. Yes, and you were so kind. I have not had an opportunity to express my thanks or my admiration. How charming of you. May I present Mr. bellis. Mrs. Courtney. Mrs. Henry Courtney? Do you know my husband? Only in business. We have certain mutual interests. I trust they prosper? Exceedingly, so far. How cautious that sounds. - I'm a cautious man. - Really? I should have said quite the opposite. Well, appearances can be deceptive, you know. Oh, would you excuse me, please. Who's that, Olivia? A man of some talent. He paints, I believe. How clever. He likes you, did you notice? Oh, nonsense. Olivia. Look, over there behind lord beyer. - Mrs. Courtney. - Sir John. What a pleasant surprise. Mrs. harwood. May I present sir John curle. I've heard a great deal about you. I haven't seen you for a long time, Mrs. Courtney. Oh, Mrs. Courtney has not been well, but she's thriving now. She tends to go out a good deal. I am delighted. Oh, how stupid of me. I seem to have mislaid my fan. Sir John, would you show Mrs. Courtney the pictures while I go and look for it? With pleasure. Susan? It's been so long. I can't believe it's really you standing close beside me. Two years, without a word. I didn't dare write before. But now it's safe? No, but Olivia's given me strength. Without her, I wouldn't have had the courage to write to you. I'm so terrified of Henry. If only I could help you. John, dear, I must talk to you, properly. This week, while Henry's away. - Where could we meet? - Saturday evening. My sister's giving a dinner party, I'll see you're invited. I think I prefer gainsborough's duchess of Devonshire. I've never seen it. It was stolen in 1876. How wicked of someone! Ah, wickedness abounds, Mrs. harwood. It's as universal as love. Where is she? With sir John just behind us, don't look now. I sold the bonds for 300 pounds. Three hundred? I thought at least five. Are you doubting me? Oh, no. Should I? I should like you to kiss me. I have an idea it might outrage the bishop of London on my left. So, consider yourself kissed. I think you should run along now and break up Mrs. Courtney's romance. Love thrives in frustration. The first reunion should be short. Goodbye, my darling. Goodbye, my dear. An old friend of ours is casting curious glances, Mark. I'm feeling a little parched, my dear Edgar. Would you care to join me in a glass of something at the metropole? You know it's criminal leaving these pictures behind again. Such a superb market in America. Susan. Are you ready? We shall be late. You look beautiful. Thank you. I am so excited. This is my first new evening dress for such a long time. - How do I look? - Lovely. Take the hair our of your eyes. Olivia, do you think that John... He'll be very impressed. Susan. Come into the drawing room, I want to talk to you. You, too, Mrs. harwood. Henry! When did you get home? Why didn't you tell me? - A very lovely dress, Mrs. harwood. - Thank you. I wasn't expecting you for several days. Sit down, Susan. What a surprise. We were just going out to dinner with lady saper. Mrs. harwood. Wasn't it nice of her to ask us? Since when have you been transacting business with the firm of smathers and fortescue, a stock broker? Why have you never told me that you have shares in the kimberley mines, and why did you sell them? Answer me. I wanted to buy some new dresses. I was under the impression that you are adequately clothed. A woman likes to change, to wear something new. Whose idea was this? Mine. You see I thought that... Well, let's just say, that we thought... "We"? And you also decided to extend your wardrobe, Mrs. harwood? No, no, of course not. In that case, it's remarkable that you should appear in a costume which must have cost more than your year's wages. Oh, I gave it to her. Really? And what other gifts has my wife made you? What else have you acquired? Susan is my oldest friend, if she chooses to give me these things... I can only marvel at your powers of persuasion and my wife's gullibility. Whatever Susan did for me, she did of her own free will. It's of no importance. Susan will be leaving for the argyle sanatorium tomorrow night. She won't require your services any longer. Sanatorium? Henry, you don't mean that. Now, go to your room and try to write lady saper a note telling her of you sudden indisposition. - Olivia... - But she's so much better, I assure you. - She's controlling herself. - I told you to go to your room. You can't do this, it's inhuman. Mrs. harwood, I took you into my house believing that you were a decent, orderly person. I find, on the contrary, that you're a cheat and a thief, and that you have taken advantage of your presence here to corrupt my wife. Under the circumstances your opinion is, to say the least, impertinent. Whatever Susan is, you have made her, with your unkindness, your intolerance, your complete indifference to anybody's feelings except your own. Make quite certain that you're out of this house within 15 minutes. Thank you, ma'am. Mark. Mark! Mark? Oh, Mark! Mark. Oh, darling. Olivia, what are you doing here? - It's happened. - What's happened? He knows about the shares. He came at me like a demon. He told me my services weren't needed any longer and ordered me out of the house. He's sending her to a sanatorium. Mark, tell me what to do! Calm yourself, darling, calm yourself. The first thing to do is sit down and have a glass of wine while you tell me all about it. And don't worry, we'll find a way. - Mark. - Yes. I hate the idea of going to his office again. I hate it for you, but it's necessary. It's cold and musty. I hated that first meeting. He knew so much more about me than I knew about him. Your hair's like silk. I love you so much. Darling. I've not seen these before. They're Susan's. Oh, you're learning. Almost too easily. I have her pearls and you have her bonds. But, darling, must we? Scruples again? No. I'm beyond that now. But it does seem, I don't know, a rather sordid way of making a life for ourselves. There's no other way, darling. No. Five minutes' unpleasantness. That's all it means. If only I could believe that. Ten at the outside. Supposing he refuse it? He won't. He can't afford to, he has no choice. Neither have I. How do I know these are not forgeries? They are copies, I have the originals. The most recent is dated over two years ago. My wife has been foolish, but obviously it was all over long ago. Please note the date of this one. Sir John curle. - I take it this also is a copy? - Yes. - Who has the original? - I have. And what does sir John have? Another copy. You think of everything, Mrs. harwood. How much? Five thousand pounds, in cash. And if I refuse? I see, an open scandal. How will I know there aren't others? My word. Not exactly a gilt-edged security. I shall have to liquidate certain holdings. It will take a few days. You may have until tonight. Tonight! You are certainly forcing the pace. I'm now going to your house to collect my belongings. I shall wait for you there. - How much? - Nothing yet. Tonight, at his house. - I told you to wait for it. - Oh, don't worry, tonight. - Are you positive? - Absolutely. I had the whip hand, and he knew it. I was utterly in command. You enjoyed yourself. Yes, the power of it. It was a wonderful sensation. I was quite calm, my heart wasn't pounding and my mouth wasn't dry. I was utterly in possession. I'm beginning to know you, Olivia. I'm beginning to know myself. The boat train leaves at 8:30. I'll meet you at the station. We're going tonight? Your ticket. Cabbie, stop here. Mark, it's happening. I never really believed it. Charing cross, eight o'clock. Well, thank you, Mr. Smathers, for your help. You can rely on Mr. Jarvis' discretion in this matter, sir. He's helped me on several occasions. - Good day, sir. - Good day. I suppose there's no doubt about this man, bellis. Not a shadow, sir. He goes by various names. Robert campion, Gilbert lemoin, and Kenneth arrow. It's all here. They could hang him with that little lot, when they know where to look for him. - But they don't know. - Not yet, sir. I'll go on to Scotland yard from here. You'll make no charges nor take any proceedings whatever without my authority. - Is that understood? - But murder is involved. This inquiry was made at my request. It will remain in my hands. I have my duty, sir. With which I promise I shall not interfere, in due course. Come in. - Oh, Curtis. - Yes, ma'am. Did you give my message to Mrs. Courtney? I did, ma'am, but I daren't let you see her. The master's orders. Is she well? She's wretched, ma'am. He's taking her to Scotland tonight to a sanatorium or something. It'll be the death of her. Well, tell the coachman to take these things to charing cross at once, please. - The station, ma'am? - The boat train for Dover. - You're going abroad, ma'am? - Yes. Come in. Yes, Rogers? Mr. Courtney would like to see you immediately, madam. - Downstairs. - Thank you. I won't keep you a moment, Mrs. harwood. I've very little time, Mr. Courtney. I agree, in fact, I should say you have not time at all. A fascinating character, your Mr. bellis. He seems to have committed almost every crime in the calendar. What are you talking about? Forgery, larceny, murder. - Murder! - You seem surprised. Burglary, theft. We'll exclude painting, though I gather his is outrageous enough to be considered a crime by the critics. It's all here in detail. Much of it unknown to the police, as yet. What do you want? My wife's correspondence, the originals, this time, in exchange for this. Who else have you told? No one. How do I know I can trust you? You don't. This may be just a copy. It may and it may not. That's your gamble. He'll hang, Mrs. harwood. It's a fair exchange. My good name for his life. There were nine. Oh, yes, by all means. By the way, you were quite right. It is just a copy. Mr. Courtney's had another attack. A bad one. - So sudden. - John, please. We were talking quietly. Take him up to his room and fetch a doctor. - I'll come up. - Yes, ma'am. Have a nice trip, ma'am. He's still unconscious, madam Curtis is with him, madam, I'm going for Dr. pound. Curtis! - Who has the key to Mrs. Courtney's room? - Curtis! - Well, I have it, ma'am. - Give it to me. Quickly, please. - Very well then. - Curtis, Curtis! Curtis, Curtis! What do you think of this spectacle? Listening at keyholes. Locked in like a child. - He's very ll. - Is he? I'm glad, I hope he dies. - With all my heart, I hope he dies! - Stop it, Susan. If I had the power to save him, I wouldn't, I wouldn't! I'm sorry, dear. It's all right now, it's all right now. Susan, listen to me. I know you didn't mean what you said just now, but if he should die, it's the one thing that you'll remember. You'll remember wishing it. It'll seem like your doing. But I didn't mean it, not really, Olivia. It's just that I'm so overwrought. Of course you are. But he's ill, desperately ill. You must help him, if you can. What can I do for him? He's had these attacks before. Think, think, Susan. What did you do then? Last time you helped him, with that medicine. Do you remember? Yes. It did help. It might again. I'll try, shall 17? Take care of her, Mrs. harwood. It is over. It was a bad attack. He always had a weak heart. Heart failure was not the cause of death. Not the heart? No, Mrs. harwood. Papers, sir, papers, sir. Papers. Mark. - In here, lady? - Yes, please. There you are, lady, all set for Dover. - Hope the queue was fine for you. - Here you are. Thank you, sir, thank you very much. - He's dead. - Dead? He knew everything about us. About you. Go on. He was in bed, ill. It was absurdly easy. I had to, Mark, I had to for you. Room for a little 'un? That's the ticket. Sorry to trouble you. Phew! Thought I wasn't gonna make it. Clock stopped, must have forgotten to wind her. I can't think why. Do it every morning of my life. First thing as I get outta bed, regular as clockwork. Ha, ha, that's good, hear that? Clock, clockwork. What a wit I have. Hello, going to Paris, eh? Me too. Helliwell's the name. Joe helliwell, commercial. Gilbert lemoin. Mister and missus? That's the stuff. Always take the missus. Brought mine if I could, only she's been dead and gone now on two years, poor soul. Got a quinsy, you know. Snuffed out like a candle. Terrible thing, death. Here, boy! Excuse me, must get a paper, shan't be out a tick. - Quickly, who knows? - Nobody vet, though I think the doctor suspects. - You? - No. I never went near him, it was Susan. I made her give him... Tickets, please. - The lady's not traveling. - Oh, very good, sir. Mark. There's bound to be an inquiry, an inquest, perhaps. You just can't disappear. - They'd suspect you at once. - But they won't know where I am. They'll discover you within 24 hours. You must go back and face them, you must go back. No, I'm going with you. You'll ruin everything for both of us. Mark, I need you. I've no strength left. That's when you're strongest. Now listen carefully. You must account for your movements tonight. You were going abroad. You had sent your luggage to the station, you had to collect it. Susan needed you. You canceled you journey. Do you understand? Mark, I implore you. You know nothing about the cause of his death. You had no motive. You know nothing about me. I was your boarder, and that's all. You don't even know where I've gone. Is that clear? I'll write to you from Paris. Send letters to the cafe durand montparnasse. And keep your head, darling, and use it. You'd better finish that inside, we're just off. Goodbye, darling. For three days, gentlemen, you have heard the testimony regarding the death of Mr. Henry Courtney. It has been established that he had become morose and ill, largely owing to his lack of issue to his marriage. You may consider this sufficient motive for a man to take his own life. It is for you to decide whether he did. Whether, indeed, it was possible for him to do so. As to the second alternative, that the antimony was deliberately introduced into the deceased's medicine by someone else, implying a verdict of murder by persons a, unknown, or b, known. You have heard evidence that the medicine was given to Henry Courtney by his wife, on her own admission, and on the evidence of the maid, Curtis. You have heard Mrs. Courtney deny she knew the medicine contained a deadly poison. From the time Henry Courtney was carried into his bedroom by the Butler, only two persons had access to him, the maid, Curtis, and his wife, which brings us to the implication of murder by persons known. Witness has been borne that Mrs. Courtney had been heard to desire her husband's death, the most recent occasion being not half an hour before the fatal dose was administered. In addition, you have heard from Mrs. Courtney senior that her daughter-in-law was addicted to alcohol and that the deceased had planned, on the night of his death, to take her to a sanatorium in Scotland to effect a cure, strongly against her will. Gentlemen, this evidence may lead you to conclude that the motive for this crime, if crime it is, lies in one direction and with one person only. Do you have any letters for me? - Rien, monsieur. - Are you sure? Absolument, monsieur. Hello, Mark. This is lizette, a very charming model. She has no english, but her art is international. Mark bellis, my dear, wanted by the police of three continents, and most of the women. Enchanté, mon ami. - Get rid of her. - Au revoir, lizette. A toute a I'heure! Au revoir, chérie. Garcon... Read it to me. L'affaire Courtney. Hmm. Aha. Stop grunting like a pig and translate it. "Concluding her evidence, Mrs. harwood repeated her conviction that the deceased had taken his own life by deliberately placing the poison in his own medicine bottle." Huh, sad, of course. Say, this strikes the right note. "Verdict tomorrow." That's today. Well, well, it's a foregone conclusion. Suicide. - Murder. - Murder? What else do you expect? The evidence is all against her. Poor girl, she fainted in court. No wonder, that fool of a coroner almost denounced her in his summing up. Rubbish! The girl killed her husband and I can't say I blame her. The man was a swine. No question about it, she did it. She did? Certainly! Forgive me, but I was foolish enough to think you mentioned something about suicide just now. The law suggests murder, and I agree with the law. You agree with the law. This is a unique occasion. It calls for a toast. To the law. Gentlemen of the jury, are you agreed on your verdict? - Yes, sir. - How say you? We return a verdict of willful murder against Mrs. Susan Courtney. Silence, please. Mrs. Susan Courtney, you have heard the verdict of the jury and you are committed on my warrant to stand trial at the next central criminal court. Officer, close the court. All manner of persons who have had anything to do with this court before the queen's coroner for this county touching the death of Henry Courtney, having discharged your duties, may depart hence. What are you doing here? Who exactly are you? Jarvis is the name, ma'am. Confidential investigations promptly and personally performed. Your servant, ma'am, and humanity's. I've no business with you. Oh, I know that, ma'am. There's nothing you want investigated. Quite the reverse, if anything. Hm? What do you want? Only the pleasure of knowing you, ma'am. Oh, I know it's customary to be introduced through a mutual friend, but as our friend, yours and mine, is no longer with us, you'll pardon the Liberty, I'm sure. Did you know Mr. Courtney? Know him, ma'am? Why, we hadn't a secret between us. Anytime he wanted to know something or other about someone or other, he'd come to me and I'd dig it up for him. And the things you'd find in the most respectable neighborhood, you'd be surprised, ma'am. Why take that little place of yours in minton street, for instance. Now, who in the world would have thought that in that house lived a pair of murderers? Oh, don't go ma'am, please. You've nothing to fear from me. Why don't you go to the police? No evidence, no proof. And no chance of obtaining the one or the other. Neither have they. Why do you come to me? As a student of human nature, ma'am, I've spent a lifetime studying crime, and I wanted to meet a woman who seems to have committed the perfect one. A woman with the nerve not only to do it, but to let another woman hang for it. Get out of here! I was afraid you'd take it like this. Ah, well. Think of it. There she'll be, Mrs. Courtney, I mean, through weeks of trial and appeal, suffering all the slow, majestic processes of the law, until at last early one morning, justice is done. And she is hanged by the neck until dead. And here you'll be, all that time, unmoved, unshaken, hardly giving the matter a moment's thought. Just calmly and quietly going about your business, here in the house where it happened. A brave woman, Mrs. harwood. Good day to you, ma'am. Susan? Susan. I knew you'd come. How do you feel? Are they treating you well? Is there anything I can do? Nothing. Sir John came to see me yesterday, Susan. Susan. He loves you. He'll help you, it will be all right. He's with you all the time. Remember that. No use. I killed him, you know. Has to be me. Couldn't have been anybody else. I wanted him to die, remember? I must have been out of my mind. Henry was right, he wanted to put me in a sanatorium. - He killed himself, Susan. - No. - He killed himself. - No, not Henry. He would never let me be free of him. Isn't it strange? He doesn't seem to be dead at all. I can't stand the waiting any longer. Will it be soon, do you think? I don't mind it if it's soon. It's, it's just the waiting. No, oh, I know, Susan. It's time to leave now. Don't go. Oh, please let me stay. I must talk to her. I'm sorry. "My dearest, I saw her today, in the prison hospital.” Dear god, the sight of her lying there, I'll never forget it. The fear in her eyes, her torment, her absolute faith in me. How long I can endure this agony of mine, I don't know. I'm without comfort, without sleep, "and above all, without you." Go and see duval. Tell him I'll fake a Rembrandt for him, two if he likes, but I want 5,000 francs each. And find out when the next boat sails for New York and get me two berths. - Rembrandts, you don't... - Yes, now hurry! - You fool. - Fool? For doing the one thing you've been begging me to do for months? I begged you, yes, but "no, I'm a great artist," you said. "Li won't destroy the one thing I believe in." I called you an idiot, but I admired you. Now I have nothing but contempt for your romantic obsession with your former landlady. Obsession, perhaps you're right. Perhaps that is the word. But this last two weeks, I've been living in torment. One side of my brain battling against the other and my heart battling them both in turn, and I'm sick of it. I'm sick of pretending I don't know! I'm sick of pretending I don't care! But I do know and I do care. Now, do as I told you. No evidence, no proof, and no chance of obtaining the one or the other. Neither have they. Implying a verdict of murder by persons a, unknown, b, known. It's ho use. I killed him, you know. That the medicine was given to Henry Courtney by his wife. As a student of human nature, ma'am, I've spent a lifetime studying crime and I wanted to meet a woman who seems to have committed the perfect one. A woman with the nerve not only to do it, but to let another woman hang for it. Stay here, if you want to and die, wretchedly. Or come with me, come with me, and live. Until at last early one morning, justice is done. She's hanged by the neck until dead. I can't stand the waiting any longer. Will it be soon, do you think? I don't mind it if it's soon. It's the waiting. Oh! Where were you going in this? I can't sleep, Mark. I'm going to tell. Then I'll sleep. I must sleep. We're going away, Olivia. Together, as we always planned. I'm taking you away. But, Mark, it's too late now. I must tell someone, please. - You don't know. - Yes, I do. That's why I'm here. He's dead and I'm glad he's dead. I don't regret that. He was cruel and selfish, utterly selfish. I did it, and I'd do it again. For you. They'll... hang her, won't they? Not for weeks, not for months, perhaps, but they'll do it. Early one morning, justice is done. I went to see her again today. She thinks she's guilty. She's a little mad, you know. She actually believes she killed him. She'll probably confess tomorrow. That's funny, isn't it? Isn't that funny? Olivia, listen to me. They'll take care of her in a nursing home. That's all, do you understand? They'll say she's not responsible, and that's true, now, isn't it? Whatever you tell them can't change her now. And he made her that way, her husband, not you. Are you listening? A home? - Just a home? - Yes. Oh, if I could believe that. You can, you must. Where, where could we go? To Ireland, we'll be married there. And then America, the other side of the world. - When? - Tomorrow. Oh, take me now. Darling, we can't be seen together. They're watching for me, perhaps even here. I can't let you go. But it'll only be for tonight. Now listen carefully, you must leave openly for the country for a rest. - Not without you. - Darling, pack you things. Put them in a hansom, then I'll meet you. - Where? - The Abbey. Westminster, 10 o'clock tomorrow night. I'll have everything ready. Mark, I love you completely. Till tomorrow. - Is he in? - Is who in? Him... oh, Mark I mean, Mark bellis. - There's no one here by that name. - Come on. It's no good, your trying to play me up. A man said he saw him here and that he'd be back. Man? What man? What was he like? Old bloke with a soft voice and a bushy moustache. Why all the questions? Well, I see we're all covered up. I must say it's a great improvement. I never did like that red plush. So faded. And that brown stain on the carpet. I told Mark straight, I said, "I don't know how you can live in a place like that." You've been here before? Yes! Don't tell me you didn't know? You mean to say he didn't tell you about me? I knew about you, all right. What's the matter? What are you staring at? Here, what are you... Would you please go? We're right on time. Euston at 11:30, liverpool noon tomorrow, breakfast in Dublin Thursday morning, and the royal mail sails for New York in 10 days. Are you happy? Darling, you're tired. You need rest and you shall have it. We haven't any money, but we'll be lucky together. I'm sure of it. We'll follow the sun. I'll paint you against the California sky picking oranges in a white muslin dress with your hair down about your shoulders the way it fell the first day I asked you to pose for me. Do you remember? You were so shy and so very beautiful. I think that was the moment I first fell in love with you. And [I've fought that moment a thousand times a day. I planned my whole life, and loving you wasn't part of the plan. Now, it's the heart of it, the only part that counts. On the whole, I like myself less than I can possibly say. You're my one excuse for living, although it's taken me quite some time to make myself admit it. Please forgive me, and please forgive me for what I've brought you to, as well. Murder. That's all over with. No. Darling, you must forget it. I'll give you my life, for what it's worth, to make up for it. Cabbie? To the nearest police station. A brave woman, Mrs. harwood.
