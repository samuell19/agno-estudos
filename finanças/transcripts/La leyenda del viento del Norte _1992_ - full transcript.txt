Produced by IÃ±igo Silva Directed by Juanba Berasategi Original music by Alejandro Masso An original story by Gregorio Muro Look, Watuna, it is the spirit of the great whale. One of them will give us the oil we need - - to survive the terrible north wind. At last San Juan de Pasajes. Here I will become the richest man on earth. Because I am the great Athanasius, I know the secret, - - the secret of the legend of the north wind. The legend of the north wind. Journal of the San Juan. Today we set sail for Newfoundland on a whale hunt. There we will renew with our Mi'kmaq friends the secret pact against the north wind. We will carry on board the ceremonial cider. Don't worry, Captain, the cider will arrive in time. Ane, stop fantasizing and tell me if we're on the right way. I don't see anything. Whale in sight. She'll better hurry, I can't stop. Give way, give way to the super captains. - What's wrong now? - More trouble. Fresh sardines! Good riddance, it was the giant walruses. You're ruining my career. Who's gonna hire a pirate with a boatswain's mate who can't roar? We're broke, and it's all your fault. But I swear you'll learn to roar. Go on, roar. You're the shame of the profession. Who do you think you're scaring with that kind of a meow? I want you to do it louder, you knucklehead. Check this out. Oh, boy! That wasn't bad, huh? Copy it and you can have a drink. I knew you'd get it. Well, let's celebrate. But drink it slowly; it's very strong. You've fallen for it again, Claw. What a silly cat! My cider! This is a riot! Come over here. I'm going to show you what Captain Bakallu does with mutineers. I've got you. You have no idea what you're in for. Brake, Peiot! -Drop anchor! -I can't. I'm swept away by the current. It's a giant cod and a sea tiger. Help! I want to get off! Go on, Peiot, he's already got off. Giant cod, eh? My name's Bakallu. - They'll hear me. How disrespectful! - And they called us walruses. Claw, you are to blame for everything. Give way to San Juan's cider and the brave captains. Get ready, Peiot. I'm getting ready. For what? For this. You're crazy! This time we'll get it. -We almost caught half the town. -Get down. Don't let them see us. What's the meaning of this? A dangerous boarding, yes sir, - - but you've brought the goods safe and sound; - - our special cider for the trip, here it is. Captain Galar will be very pleased. Congratulations, fussy kids, you have fulfilled the order perfectly. I imagine it has not been easy, - - but in the end, shipping the cider, which was the important thing, is now done. It has been very difficult. And very dangerous. You don't need to tell me anything, Ane, I understand you perfectly. Just looking at the horizon I see the dangers that lie in wait for you. Martin, they are coming for us. I told you, there they are. My goodness, two beautiful mermaids are calling for you with their beautiful songs! Pretend, they're coming. A flying cow! Up you go. Come on, with all your might. Up you go. It's so heavy! You see, Martin, first we ran into a whale. Then into the giant walruses, - - and we were attacked by a terrible cod and a sea tiger, - - but we managed to fight our way through like intrepid captains. Like this: "Way, way to the San Juan's cider." It's your fault, Martin. What a way to educate children! You fill their heads with fantasies and here's the outcome. Here you go. - But, ladies, it won't happen again. - You bet. - Are you all right, Martin? - Those fine ladies are right: it's my fault. It hasn't been easy for an old cook like me to bring up orphans, - - but what is life without fantasy? I was a child too, like you, - - and I dreamed of being a captain casting orders from the bridge. Martin, may I ask what you are doing? Captain Galar, I was showing Peiot how to scrub the deck. Tell me, Martin, is everything ready to go? This is crazy. Everyone is nervous about the voyage. I don't want any games on board, Martin, especially not with the ceremony cider. I will be at that ceremony, - - and I will take possession of the sacred vase that indicates the access - - to a bay where thousands of whales gather. There I will be able to hunt them easily with my secret weapon. That is the business I propose to you, the biggest business of your life. Fantastic bays, secret ceremonies... Fantasies, sir, tavern tales. "Tavern tales." Tavern tales? Money! All right. Calm down, Mr. Athanasius, and clear up a question for me: - - how is it possible that in so many years of chasing a whale - - I haven't heard anything about this bay you're talking about? Because it is a secret jealously guarded by the Mi'kmaq Indians - - and some whalers of this village. They could become immensely rich, - - but the very stupid ones hunt only what they need to survive. A waste. Only I know the secret thanks to a legend I found in this old book: - - The legend of the north wind. Legends, fantasies,... I need something more certain, - - something that proves that this legend is true - - and that my secretary will spend the rest of his life counting money. I need proof. Proof? Very well, here it is. See for yourself. Martin, tell us about the ceremony. Tell you about that? Fussy girl, it's an old whaler's secret, and secrets are not told. If any bad guy found out, it would be terrible. But on this trip we're going to become whalers. Ane, don't insist. Peiot is coming as cabin boy, but you're not coming. Women don't hunt whales. Why not? Explain. Storms would break out, masts would break, sails would tear, - - animals would learn to talk, the world would turn upside down. Everyone knows that women witch ships. Tell him it's not true, Peiot. I don't know, I think we should listen to Martin. Traitors, I didn't expect this from you. But you're not going to get rid of me so easily. Tell me, when do you plan to leave? As soon as possible. Today, with the tide. What's the hurry? There's a slight inconvenience, Mr. Shipowner. Only one person knows the place and date of the ceremony. - Who's that? - Captain Galar. -Galar?! And as everyone knows, the San Juan sails today. We have no choice but to go with him. Good. Will he admit you on your ship? If he knew what my real intentions were, of course not. But if the reason for my trip was to find medicinal plants to help mankind, then yes. You are a demon. I'll give you a demonstration. I'm sure you'll like it. Hello, child. They don't seem to bite, do they? Dear partner, you're going to have the privilege - - of attending a little demonstration of my secret weapon. This is a weapon designed to give the victim no chance of defense. With this small amount... -They are dead! -Are they dead? No, just asleep. Now imagine this with the big whales. They won't be able to escape or defend themselves. Sometimes appearances can be deceiving. "Appearances can be deceiving"... What an idea! What a silly cow! The voyage hasn't even started yet - - and I'm already getting tired of being a cabin boy. I hope appearances to be deceiving. I have to convince Captain Galar. Gorriti, it was an accident. I didn't mean to... Really, Gorriti, really. No, help! Calm down, Gorriti! Calm down, please. Sorry, Martin. You're forgiven. I love well-mannered people. Sorry, Martin. The eggs! I hate well-mannered people. What would you say I look like? Well, that's what I am: a sea dog with a full beard. Yes, sir. You're going for the whale, aren't you, boy? Well, you can set sail easy now. The man you need has finally arrived. But my crew is complete. Without me? With Perotxo, Esteban, and Xanti? I've seen them on deck, - - and if they hunt whales the way they tame helpless little cows... Boy, you need me. I know a new way to hunt whales. A unique, surprising, foolproof way. You throw some little powder in the water, and... Mr. Captain, the tide... Sorry, I didn't know you had a visitor. I'll come back later. Oh, I'll be damned! Martin, you're to blame for everything. Enough, Ane. I hope you'll admit once and for all that women can't go aboard a whaler. They bring bad luck. It's not fair. You won't even give me a chance. I'd make a good cabin boy. And know one thing: Peiot is a boy, but he gets seasick. What a temper! Well, I'm not giving up. I'll go whatever it takes. - Ane! - What do you want, snob? Will you come to see me off? Pirate Bakallu at your service, sir. - Nice to meet you, Barquillu. - My name is Bakallu. Let's talk about practical matters, Bakallu. You will take charge of my best-built ship - - and you will follow Mr. Athanasius as he travels on the San Juan. When you arrive, he will give you instructions on what to do. You will sail at night. By day I want you away, Ratallu. But how will I know which route to take if I can't get close? And besides, my name is Bakallu. - Don't worry about such trifles, Carcallu. - Bakallu. That's the least of it. It'll be a piece of cake. Just follow the light. And the San Juan will be yours. It's so easy that even an idiot could do it. "An idiot." She didn't come to see me off. Come on, Peiot, you know Ane. She's probably in hiding planning some of her mischiefs. I'm sure she'll come to see us off with something spectacular. You'll see. Poor Ane! It'll be a long time before I see her again. It's now or never. Diary of the San Juan. The weather is good and the wind is favorable. We are approaching Newfoundland. Soon it will be time for the whale hunt and to meet up with our Mi'kmaq friends. I wonder what they are doing now. Watuna, the Mi'kmaq chief's son, - - asks the bear spirit for permission to hunt the bear. Well, I have already told him. I hope he won't make it too hard for me. He's already smelled the trap. Come on, you greedy bear. You like honey, huh? Let's see what you do with this little gift. Come on. Come on, come here, little bear. Come on. Don't be shy, don't give it a second thougt. Come on! Hit it hard, little bear. Move away the stone that hinders you from eating the honey. I'm sorry, brother bear... - - but I have no choice but to hunt you. Only hunters participate in the ceremony with the whalers. I have to prove that I am no longer a child. Then I'll be at the ceremony. Nice hit, little bear! What was that? Where am I? Where's the honey? Let go! It was a joke, brother bear. Help! Father, he wants to devour me! Help! The chief says the whalers will be here any minute. What nerves, my God, I don't know what to wear! Help me! Do you remember the nice fat guy - - who was so interested in our recipes? - Martin. Help, he wants to eat me! Help me, Father! Help, help! - Help! - Watuna! I'm lost. I must find shelter. Watch out. Have you gone mad? Do you want the north wind to destroy us? You almost broke the sacred vase. I'm sorry, but I was being chased by a terrible bear. Stop it. You have no excuse. This is unforgivable. When will you stop behaving like a child? I wanted to become a great hunter so I could be at the ceremony with the whalers, - - but I promise you'll soon be proud of me. I've had enough of hiding in this cellar. I'm going out to get some fresh air. Don't make a sound. Someone is coming. A good bath will take away your dizziness. See? I told them he gets dizzy and they didn't believe me. And no clothes, no one will see you. This is getting interesting. What an idea! So I'll take the opportunity to eat something. Inside, Peiot. I'm sick of apples from the cellar. Aha. Well, the bath has given you an appetite, Peiot. We'll talk man to man. You're going to learn the secret of the whalers of the San Juan - - and what the ceremony is all about. Go on, go on, boy. That's it, go on, it'll do you good. Our ancestors tell us that many, many, many years ago, - - the terrible north wind was about to destroy the world. It is a moving story that tells the origin of the legend of the north wind. But go on, Peiot. Old men and children were dying of cold - - while the bonfires were losing strength in their ashes. Then a Mi'kmaq warrior and a whale hunter had the same dream: - - They saw a place where thousands of whales were sheltering. "Let's go there," they said, "before our children freeze to death." When I think of those little angels, terrified with cold, I get emotional. Poor children! They sailed to that place, caught a whale, and with its oil rekindled the fire. Thanks to that the wind lost so much strength that the men enclosed its power in a vase. Then the north wind, as it imprinted the way of the great bay in the vase, shouted angrily: - - "Go ahead, this is the way that leads to the great bay of whales." - - "By following it, you will have it all. - - But the day you destroy it my dominion will spread over the whole earth." Then the warrior and the whale hunter agreed that no one - absolutely no one, - - was to enter the great bay. And so as not to forget it they decided that they and their children's children - - would meet every year. That is why we celebrate the ceremony with the Mi'kmaq. And we do it in front of the sacred vase - - to promise that we will only hunt what we need to survive. So you know, fussy kid, only what is necessary. Never forget that. And that's it. By the way, my boy, I can't tell you how glad I am - - that you've managed to beat the seasickness. Keep it up, Peiot. "Keep it up, Peiot." He's in a joking mood. Well, that's a sign that he's over the dizziness. Here again? Don't tell me you're still hungry. Eating? gross! What a weird kid! Yes. So that was the ceremony? And you had to be a boy to learn that? Someone's coming. Who's there? Ah, it's just the cow. Well, it's lucky no one comes down to this cellar. Just as well, so no one will stand in my way. Let's see. Where is it? Yeah, all right. That's it. Oh, damn it! I've got to find it. Where is it? Where is it? Uh-huh, all right, I got you. Oh, that's perfect. And now we're going on deck. Cacallu must be anxious to get the signal. It's the guy who put the fish to sleep in San Juan. This smells bad to me. Go warn Peiot. Run, Ximur, hurry up. I need help... Well, well, well, he has left the trunk open. What might he keep there? Leave alone, Ximur. I must see the midnight sun. Now it's your turn, little ball. Guide Tracallu. Where is that light, you lousy cat? Where, where? The light! I see it! I'm seeing it! You're a genius, Athanasius, a real genius. Damn hole! You know, Claw? All I have to do is follow that light, - - and the San Juan will be mine. Do you understand, stupid? For 100,000 corks and bottles! I've had enough of you, Claw. Get out of my sight. What do I see? Another light? This is a good one. I now have one light fore and one light aft. Bow to stern light, stern to bow light. There goes the last light ball. Bon voyage. Flying carrack! - Hey, Martin! - Great timing! It's the midnight sun. Can I come down now? I'll settle the score for you, you ugly bird. And now it flies! This time I won't miss. I'm about to become a great hunter. I've got you, little bear! I've got you! I've got...! You're not my little bear. No, Mrs. Bear. It was just a joke. Your son and I were just playing. What a nuisance. "Peiot, scrub the deck," "Peiot, sweep the galley," "Peiot, we're out of milk"... I look more like a cleanser than a sailor. Ane doesn't know how lucky she is not to have come. If she only knew how much I miss her! "When you don't get seasick you'll be able to talk to men." Bah! I feel very lonely, Gorriti. Only you listen to me. If you could talk to me... - Poor Peiot! I'm so sorry, my boy. - Thank you, Gorriti. You're welcome. Listen, I have something important to tell you. I found out that that guy you have on board, Athanasius, - - is a scoundrel with very bad intentions. He wants to steal the sacred vase and destroy the bay of whales. You have to tell the captain. - You're talking to me! - Of course I'm talking to you! Help! Cut the witchcraft! Peiot, where are you going? You have to bring him the book. Here are the proofs. - The cow, the cow... - What's wrong with you, boy? Gorriti, the cow... Calm down and tell me what's wrong with the cow, young man. Well, it talks, the cow talks. Don't talk nonsense. Cows don't talk. Well, Gorriti does. She says you want to destroy the great bay of whales. Oh, yeah? What else has the cow told you? Whale ahoy! Over there, there she blows! Let go of me. I've got work to do. And besides, cows don't talk. Wow, this means there's someone who knows more than he should. And now I know where the curious one is hiding. Captain, forward! - Forward, you say? - Forward, Captain! We need that whale's oil. Cheer up, lads. All ahead. Row hard. It's mine, Captain! This one won't get away from me. Stop, it's a baby whale. We only hunt adult whales. Damn meddling girl! This is the end of your trip. I'm not a girl, I'm a stowaway, and I've found you out. Yes, but you can't tell anyone, no one, you fool. You don't know what awaits you. Ximur, Gorriti, help! - Dead! They're dead! - No, just asleep. Watch out for the big one. There it is. Hold the rope! It's not getting away from me this time. It's getting away from us! This whale is not for us. Cut the rope. And now I'll mix my secret weapon in the cider of the ceremony. Scoundrel, scoundrel! And I will steal the sacred vase while everybody is asleep. Help! Help! Get me out of here! Land! - Look! - Here we are at last! The wonderful Newfoundland! Watuna, you have to get out of here. Up, up. There's no way out here either. I wonder what else can happen to me now. - What a day! - You animal! You beast, you traitor! I bet your feet smell. Get me out of here! Coward, murderer! I'm neither a traitor nor a coward. That's for starters, talking box. I am Watuna, the son of the keeper of the great bay of whales. Liar. Then why do you want to poison the whalers of the San Juan - - and our friends the Mi'kmaq with the cider of the ceremony? What? Who wants to poison the Mi'kmaq? Go get him, Ximur, come on! Now you will see what is good. Where am I? This is not the San Juan. - A monster! - Who are you? - Ane. And you? - Watuna. The ceremony! We always end up the same way: - - me sitting on the cow and poor Xanti running in front. Gorriti is quite spirited. My dear friend Galar, my heart is full of joy for your presence here. Mine also longed for this moment. It was huge, yes, the biggest whale I have ever seen in the many years - - I have been sailing the ocean aboard a whaler. Then she gave us a terrible tail whipping that nearly shattered the boat - - and wiped us all out. Drink up. But fortunately we were able to maneuver at the last instant. Here's to our cabin boy. To our cabin boy! Now let's drink to the renewal of the pact against the north wind. To the pact! If only they'd give me a chance... I'm beginning to understand Ane. She would make a fine cabin boy, not me. You're being a pain in the ass about how I don't look like a whaler! Well, yes sir, in my village they say that whalers have a face full of hair. Well, I don't have a beard. So what? Does it matter? And you know what? You don't look like a Mi'kmaq either. In my village they say you wear feathers and paint your faces. We'd better call it quits. Let's see if we can get Bally in the water. How do you like your new name, little whale? We're great, Watuna! We did it! The music's stopped. Something must have happened. You're mine now. Raise the flag, Claw. We'll take possession of the San Juan with a full-fledged boarding. What should I tell Ane when I get home? Because of seasickness I can't be at the ceremony. Ane, I can't believe what you tell me. This Athanasius must be crazy. I tell you he is, and he will destroy the great bay if we don't stop him. We can't get out of here. We're trapped. We won't give up. We must come up with something to get out of here. Ximur, this is no time for jokes. Leave that paddle alone, silly bird. Be quiet if you don't want to... What oar are you talking about? This oar is mine and it was outside. There must be a way out underwater. Ximur, you're great. I'm sorry your first trip is your last, kid. I'm a cabin boy, and you're up to something. That was discovered by someone not long ago, and she hasn't lived to tell the tale. All aboard! Come in, Claw, let's take possession of the San Juan! Come on! - Shame of a harpooner you are. - Wait. Not the pants! Let go, we'll crash! Well, now my seasickness is gone! Do something, Claw. Don't just stand there. If you've finished making a fool of yourself, Trancallu, sink this boat so no one can follow us! - Aye, aye, sir. - Yes, sir, I feel better than ever! I feel like a great captain. Inside this chest we'll reach the San Juan. That's where we'll find Peiot. Hey, how did this boat get here? But it's my canoe! Get out of there quickly. I know, Bally's mom brought it. The whales are helping us. A crew looking for a captain. May they be as brave as me? Well, never mind. Hey, you in the canoe! - Who's that? -My brother. - He looks like a nutcase. Yeah, he doesn't look the same. Peiot, where's the San Juan? - They've taken her away. - Well, let's go after her. We have to catch up with Athanasius. Stop jumping around and get in. Either you get down or I'll pull you. That's no way to talk to a captain. Right, then. I'm taking command from now on. Let's get going. Lead the way. I've had it up to here, and it's all Claw's fault. How awful! We're going to crash! Full speed ahead! Are you sure this is the way, Peiot? It's too dark. Don't you realize, man? - If the vase drives them, we'll lose them. - Look, it looks like a waterfall. - This is crazy. - Quiet. Don't fight my orders. - Come on, to your posts, Atlanteans. - If you don't shut up, I'll... - Slow down, Watuna. - I can't. You can't? Then get off my ship. Quiet, the captain's thinking. This way. - My head! - One more word and you're in the water. Got it? Ane, have I come home? What's wrong with him now? Who's that? But... it's the San Juan! What are we doing here? Of course, now I remember, Ane: they're taking the San Juan. Well, our captain has finally woken up. You, big boss, let's see you row harder. And be very careful with the waterfall. Why didn't you warn me? Because you couldn't hear a thing because of your seasickness. That's why. Catch that bird, Claw. It's making me nervous. Spying, huh? - A rope. - I've got it. Pull, you idiot, I'm falling. The waterfall! We're going straight to the waterfall! Oh, Peiot, Watuna! If you don't get me down, you're going get it! Makallu, freshwater pirate, you're going to sink us! Bakallu! - Then change course, Chanchullu! - Bakallu! I've got it. Ane! Ane, Ane! Ane! She's doomed! She won't make it! Calm down, Peiot. Ximur, something terrible has happened. Ane... Ane, Ane... Ane! Ane has fallen down the waterfall. I made it. The great bay of whales exists. You have been my amulet and my guide. Nothing stands in my way anymore. Thanks for saving me again, Bally. Let's give the evil one what he deserves. Athanasius, you've forgotten about us! More children? What are you doing here? We're here to stop you, you scoundrel, you rascal. Don't just stand there like a passer-by. Do something, Xinkallu. We must attack by surprise. The first thing is to take away his secret weapon. Come on if you've got the guts, you lousy pirate. Damn water rats! Nobody laughs at Bakallu. Get them, Claw. Damn water rats! Nobody laughs at Bakallu. Come back here, you coward. You're a silly cat. Surprise! Charge, Gorriti. Go get 'em! You big fool! Can't you handle a bunch of kids? Come on, Gorriti! While he distracts them, I'll put the whales to sleep. Mine! What's up? Give that back to me! It's Ane, she's alive! - I've got it, it's mine, I've got it! - Give it back to me! Ane is alive! It's mine now! Give me my bag! Give me that bag! That bag! Not the bag! No! It's over. Stop it you bullies, I'm suffocating! Do you want to choke me? You nearly put us all to sleep. Why did you break the bag? Look, it worked. They fell into their own trap. You're great! Good! Good, good! Look, they've recovered the sacred vase. - Give way to the heroes. - Give way to the heroes. I'm proud of you, Watuna. Even if he gets seasick, he's a great whaler. What a thrill! Ane! Come, Ane! Don't make jokes, guys. This is a very serious moment. Is that clear? It's impossible. There must be an explanation. Come, Ane! You recovered the vase, so come and put it back. What's the meaning of this? I... I... Go ahead, little girl. You've brought us good luck. Congratulations, you little devil. You finally got your way. Captain! I don't know how you did it, but thank you for saving the sacred vase. They're the ones who saved us. What do you say we find another way to beat the winter cold from now on? Then we won't need to hunt them. I'll think about it. I think you had a wonderful idea.
