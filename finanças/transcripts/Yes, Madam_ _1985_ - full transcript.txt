Miss, how are you? I'm placing you under arrest. You do not have to say anything as it could be used as evidence. - Madam, we got him. - Get him out of here. Quick! - Move along. - Excuse me. I'll take him to the station. Move it. Get out of the way! Gary, get back here. There's a robbery. Where's the key? The key! Where's the key?! Don't move. What shall we do? We'll take the truck. Cover us. Hurry up! Get a move on. Holy shit! Freeze! I don't know if I have any shots left, do you want to take the chance? All right, stand back. Madam, is he one of them? Yes. Take him away. For she's a jolly good fellow, for she's a jolly good fellow... Madam, how do you like the song? It was kind of you, but a little bit loud. If Mr Wong hears that, I'll be in trouble. OK, get back to work. For she's a jolly good fellow... - Mind your own business! - I thought you'd like it! Get moving. Mr Wong. So you've bought some flowers for me, too? ls all this necessary? No, I don't think it's necessary. But I didn't buy them. "Richard Nordon." Who is this guy? Never heard of him before. He was my instructor when I was training at Scotland Yard. I'm off on holiday to England soon and I'll stay with him. So I get the push?! Don't joke about it, or I'll tell your wife you have a girlfriend. I forgot you like to take everything seriously. I won't do it again. On a serious note, could your vacation be postponed? But I haven't been on holiday for a really long time. I know, but we've got a lot on our plate. Like the anti-prostitution campaign. As far as I'm concerned, next week I'm on vacation, sir. Yes? - Are we agreed? - Sure. I got some flowers to sell. It's OK for dinner. All right. Let's meet at the hotel. Bingo! "Tin's Holding Succeeds in £2.4 Billion Takeover Bid" "Tin's Holding Succeeds in £2.4 Billion Takeover Bid" Mr Dick, please come in. - Could I have an explanation? - Let's not beat about the bush. I've been ordered to hand over $1,000,000 in exchange for the forged contract microfilm. This is yours. Let me tell you something, 20 years ago this money would have been very attractive for me. But I'm an old man. This is really chicken feed for me. I'm very serious about this transaction. I know you are. But my boss is just as serious. No, please! Don't do that. In your field, you're an expert. In my field, so am I. Put down the gun or I'll shout. Anyone here? Anyone here? Anyone here? Must be asleep. - Can I help you, Miss? - Is Mr Nordon here, please? - Yes, he's asleep. Come in, please - Thank you. Have you forgotten? We have a dinner date tonight. Hurry up. Get a move on. Hurry. Please. CID. There's been a murder here. Wait a minute. Are you talking to me? Can you tell me how many staff are on duty? I'm not sure. - Roughly? - About 100, I guess. Bring them here. 50-50, OK? Here are your dollars. The pound is nine to the dollar. What? The pound's at 11! - Do you want to change? - No, I hate foreign currency. - This is the master's. - I'll throw these away. Wait! We'll give it to Panadol. It might be useful. - Why do we always do him favours? - That's what friends are for. - As we're rich, let's hit the town. - No! Let's go and see Panadol. - Who's there? - Registered package. Registered package? Don't move. Open up. You're holding me, how can I open the door? Let go! - He's right. - Thank you. I was stupid to open the door to you, but you're even more stupid by letting me go. I've got more fake grenades than you have. You keep it. Amateurs! Come here! Can we talk, please? Take it easy! On your feet. Where can you go? No, wait! I always help you guys out. So what if I didn't open the door? You help us?! What happened to these ID cards? What are you talking about? These were OK. I don't think so. They faded in the sunlight. And that's not all. These revolvers cost me 2,000 dollars each. What do I get? Toy guns from a supermarket. They look real to me. What do you expect from a forger? It's nothing like a real one. Why don't you check yourself? Looks the same to me. Right! Don't move. Over there. Go on, move. All right, you good-for-nothings, behave or you'll regret it. If you're as aggressive as I am now, no one will know your guns are fake. If I mix them all up together like this, see? You can't tell which one is real, can you? Told you! Amateurs! - He's chosen the wrong gun! - Really? But I'm sure I haven't chosen the wrong head. You have chosen the wrong head! I'll pull the trigger and we'll know if it's the real gun. - On your feet. - Leave me alone. - It's Panadol. - We must do something. Come on. PC 123, break down the door and arrest the suspects. - The cops are coming! - What do we do? Stupid! Use your head, run. We got them, sir. The whole place is surrounded. Get ready to move in. Charge! Piss off. Let me climb down first. I'm the slowest. You're not going anywhere. It'll teach you a lesson. You're going too slowly. Let me give you a hand. You should have looked before you leaped! Go to hell. What's going on? Are you in trouble? Lucky we came over. They were my best clients, now you've frightened them away. I told you, the guy's always complaining. We save his neck and he's still not happy. He's a crook, the parasite. I'm a parasite? You live by stealing! But we have principles. We don't rip people off with forgeries. Stop bitching, you two. I've had enough of it. That's my beer! Selfish bastard! Don't even touch my stuff from now on. - Can't you give it a rest? - He started it! Enough! You got a problem? - It's my neck. - Don't move. - I've got to find that revolver. - Don't worry. Here... I don't want to end up twisted! Help me put these guns away. I'll worry about my health. You're so messy. You should get a maid! Asprin, go get our master's money box. Hurry! Right, 2,000 dollars each. We'll never have enough to buy him a place. Have you got a problem? Let me see. They might be counterfeit. Lucky I checked. Aren't you ashamed of yourself? It's a mistake. Do you really think I'd try to rip off our master? I know you'll stop at nothing. You're a cold-blooded animal. So, cold-blooded? Maybe I am. But this is my place, if you don't like it, get out. He wants me out! All right, I'll go. What do you think you are doing? You've been quarrelling for 20 years. I'm so sick and tired of it. I'll tell our master I don't want to be with you. Enough is enough! - Please. We're only kidding. - Yes, it's normal. Don't be angry. You two had better get on with each other. Let's go and eat. - Good idea! - First of all, put the box away. Just wait! Is this any good to you, Panadol? Yeah, you bet it is. I'll sort it out tonight. Let's go. What? You don't have the negative? But it doesn't mean the cops have it. I'm sure I can get it back. You have to get it back. If we don't have that negative, our future won't be rosy. Don't worry. I guarantee I'll get it for you. If you guarantee it, then I feel better. Madam, here's the autopsy report on Nordon. Was it suicide? Don't know. But there was no struggle and no violence. Death was caused by a 4.5 mm bullet which went right through his head. This is a clue. If it's that clean, it must be a professional. Do you know how many professional killers there are in the world? - No idea. - Neither do I. But I know why you won't get promotion. - Why?! - Because you're thick! And promotion is based on merit here. Sir. What about your promotion? Did you report? Yes. Do you think I'll get to handle the case? Maybe yes, maybe no. Nordon worked for the British Commercial Crimes Bureau. He was in Hong Kong on vacation and following a lead on the Tin case. I believe he found some evidence and that's why he was killed. We'll be assisted by an officer from London. It's your job to liaise with her. - Great. We could do with a new face. - Shut up! Bend forward, like this. Work your way around. Yeah, who is it? Who's at the door? It's a newspaper! Why press the door bell? You got a problem? Take no notice! I talk to myself all the time. And stop staring at me! Crazy! "Englishman Killed in Hotel" Asprin! Where are you? I'm right here. What are you doing? Wake up! Take a look at this! Stop bugging me. Just read it out. "A British tourist was murdered in a Kowloon hotel." It's the hotel where we stole those things. That passport was his. Look at it! What's the big deal? What?! If Panadol sells that passport to someone and they get arrested, if they name Panadol, he says we gave it to him and if... I think I got too many "ifs". Yeah, just a few. I'll call Panadol. It's no use. He's waiting for us at our master's. "Poh Oi Elderly People's Home" She's on her way! Really? - It's my heart. - Quick! - Here she comes. - It's my heart. She's here now. Calm down. Come on in. Wonderful! I got it. No, don't! You mustn't. Stop it! Don't do it. You mustn't eat chicken! You're on a special diet. Stop it! Go and get that chicken. I'll take care of these three. We're here! - Master! - Master! Look! - And what are they? - Cookies. - Fresh fruit. - Water. - Water? - Right. For putting in his whiskey. Cordial! - Cordial! In his cordial. - 30 minutes for visiting. Quickly! Close the door. Look what we got you, Master! Fresh fruit. Master, check it out. - It's great! - What about these? - My heart! - Take it easy. Don't get excited. Master, we need your advice. I knew it. You only visit when you're in trouble. Master, You know that isn't true. We respect you. - We're buying you an apartment. - Yeah. Really? Who's going to inherit it when I die? It'll belong to us. It'll belong to you from day one. What do you want? Don't mind the wheelchair warriors. - Go ahead. We can't hear a thing. - What? - He said you can't hear. - It's like this... You what? Are you sure? They're in big trouble. 40 years ago, I wouldn't have bothered. 20 years ago, he'd be dead. But now you'll have to tip off the cops. - You mean grass him up? - Yes. So the guy gets caught, but what if he grasses me up? Then I'll have to grass these two up, as well. Then you go to prison. It's better than getting killed. You're right! Don't waste your time now. There is a... pay phone outside. - Go on, make the call. - Make the call! Hurry up! I've got some information... A tip-off! Line one. Somebody will try to use Nordon's passport to leave Hong Kong. - Let's go to the ariport. - Yes. You two cover the exit, the others follow me. Excuse me, Miss, Hong Kong Police. Could you tell me if British passport 157765E has checked in yet? OK, just a moment please. Yes, he has. His flight takes off in 30 minutes. Thank you. This way. Please remove your glasses. CID. Please come with me. - Don't move. - Don't shoot! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop running! - Cool it. - Stay away or I'll kill her. Stay back. Freeze! - Take him away. - Yes, Madam. Did you see that? She sure can take care of herself. But her figure is so-so. She'd have trouble getting a job in a third-class nightclub. Thank you. - She can speak Cantonese. - Let that be a lesson to you. - I'm sorry. They were a bit rude. - I know the type. But they're also useless. Her Cantonese is much better than I thought. - Excuse me, wait a moment. - What do you want? I'm arresting you for disturbing the peace and causing an affray. - Follow me to the station. - Is this really necessary? Yeah! I mean, yes. Hi, Carrie. Hello, Boss. I'm sorry, I just got here. We had a few problems. Yeah, I know. - She saw the whole thing. - You've already met? Yes, thank you. This is Detective Inspector Ng, CID. And you're the so-called expert from Scotland Yard, Carrie Morris. OK! You're going to be working together. Do you always endanger the public when you try to catch criminals? Not now. Because we've got the wonderful Inspector Morris here. All right, so you decided you were going to skip bail? It's not your lucky day, is it? Now, where did you get this passport? - Are you going to speak? - Sergeant. I'll take over, you can go now. Sure, of course. It doesn't matter who you are, I won't talk. I admire your loyalty. But the guy who sold you the passport dropped you in it. Tell us who he is so we can put him in prison. So what? He'll stay there for a few years. He can't get off that easily. I'll chop him up into pieces. Don't forget the judge could reduce your sentence. I don't care how long I stay in prison. As soon as I'm released, I'll kill the bastard. - Then you'll know who he is. - Stay calm and drink your tea. Think it over and tell me about it. You're wasting your time, I won't tell you who he is. You think you're cool, don't you? I don't know how you do things here, but I'm a police officer, not a kindergarten teacher. You could never make him talk like that. - In that case, I'll leave it to you. - I can't guarantee anything, but it's obvious your method isn't working. - So I suggest we try my method. - OK, let's give it a try. Do you want to fight me again? No, I already kicked your ass at the airport. I don't need to. It'd just be another massacre. I think you're too tough. You'll never find a husband. What does that mean?! I don't believe in miracles but I believe you'll confess. Sooner or later you'll have to come up with the goods. Spare yourself the pain. - You wouldn't touch me in custody! - Really? - Police brutality! I want a doctor. - You want what? You don't have a mark on you. Let's make it worthwhile. Anything yet? No. But there is a fight. I'm not sure but I'd say the guy's losing. Right, let's take a look. I think he's had enough. That's enough. If he'd talk that way, we would have done it already. You take over, then. - I want a doctor. - It serves you right! You should have talked. He should see a doctor. Sure, at the hospital. He was unlucky. They got him at the airport. - Someone grassed him up. - I wonder who it was. It must be the guy who sold him the passport. Flat tyre. Give me a hand. Get him! Stop! Yes, Inspector Morris. What? Let him go?! Whose idea was that? It was my idea. You released him without consulting me! Do you know the consequences? He may be Richard's murderer. More people could be killed by him. You'll be responsible for the consequences. I know what I'm doing. I can release him and I can catch him. I have 20 guys following him. Eventually, we'll get some answers. I'm not worried about the number of officers, but what they have up here. - Madam, stage one completed. - Begin stage two. I got everything ready for you! Money, ticket, passport... And I've got your death certificate ready! It's a dead end! I got you! The boss is late. Give her a call. Got you! Go to hell! Son of a bitch! You squealed on me. - I didn't. Honestly. - You're lying. No! I didn't do anything. I swear! May I fall and be horribly smashed up! Good idea. No, help! - You had me scared for a minute. - You know what happens if you lie? Yes! I know you're very kind and you won't kill me! I believe I will. Help! Help! Freeze! - Let's go of him. - I said I'd get revenge and I will. Please stay calm. Hold my shirt tightly! I'll shoot you if you don't pull him up. No, don't shoot! I don't think you have the guts. Help! Help me! - You're on the ground already. - My neck! Look... What's that? It smells horrible. It's called disinfectant. You didn't have to throw that over me. Do you know I've only been here a few days, but I've already got a nickname? - White bitch? - How'd you guess? The average cop has zero imagination. Yeah! That's why they're cops! Cut the crap. Come with me. Actually, they've been more imaginative this time. - It's Nasty White Bitch. - Really? Even with a body like that. Don't hit me! Please! Don't! Now, out it out and start cooperating. I'm stupid and I don't know how to cooperate. You want more of the same? Beating people up isn't the answer. Right! She must be having her period. - Let me handle this. - You're welcome to him! Miss, you're very polite and pretty. Cut the sweet-talk. I want to know who gave you the passport. I want you to look at the photos. Sure! I was looking! The man who provided the passport, can you describe him? The first guy has very tidy hair. And the second guy, he's very tall. - So there was two of them? - What did I just say? No, I mean, he has a nose down here and the other one has small eyes. Anything I can do for you? I told you it's not them. - Gary, get these photos posted. - No! - And put him in detention. - Detention?! Just say the word and I'll kill him. Take it easy, Mad-dog. He's not worthy. That'll make us look bad. The deal was ten million and 10% for us. And he sold it to the French! Even if we have the opium, we still need to do a lot before selling it. It's not like the old days now. The situation has changed. Don't take unnecessary risks. Don't go back to the jungle again. We can work together and enjoy the rest of our lives. In my company, we only do legitimate business. What about that Englishman? It isn't over yet. I know. But the police don't have a lot to go on. - Willie can handle it. - That's right, Boss. Leave it to me. - Willie. - How's it going, Mad- dog? Will you need my help? No. I know the guys we want - Asprin and Strepsil. They hang out at the pool hall. All right, I want this cleared up quickly, otherwise the microfilm could end up in the cops' hands. That would be the end of my business. That's not going to happen, Boss. We don't want to tempt fate! But with you two guys, nothing can go wrong! That was amazing. Look! A real sucker just came in. - Are you sure? - Take a look. The table's dirty! Give me a brush. - Sounds like an excuse to me. - And it's a poor one. Frankie. Yes, sir? Go and check out those two guys, will you? Sure. - Boss, do you mean these guys? - Yeah. Explain to them. It's like this. My boss wants a game, but not with just anyone. You two are amateurs, so forget it. There's no chance. Amateurs? You don't know what you're saying. We're in the same business. Looking for pocket money, yeah? If you've got spare money, don't waste it. Your money will soon be ours. Why not waste it? - Do you agree? - Yeah. Frankie. Rack them up. If $1,000 a point is fine, then pick your cue. - Give me my cue. - I can't believe our luck! Talk about lamb to the slaughter! But don't make it look too easy. Don't worry. To give you an advantage, I'll break. Aren't we friends? You never told us about this sucker. It's a good thing we came by today. That's what he said about you guys. - What do you mean?! - I give information to others, too. Watch the video, you might learn something. Damn it! Excuse me. Sorry! Stop playing, he's a champion. I'm not playing. I haven't touched a ball yet. 147 points. That makes $147,000. Clever mathematician, aren't you? What do we do now? - The usual plan. - Good idea. - So it's $147,000. - Yes. - Would you like a cigarette? - We want the money, not cigarettes. Mr Kwok, you're a wonderful champion. You won easily and you have our total respect, which means much more than money. So let's forget about the money. Asprin, let's go. - Please. - You brown-nose. I'll see you later. Goodbye. I can leave here, but not you two. I don't like guys who don't pay up. Teach them a lesson, Frankie. I'm leaving now. Hold on. My boss wants to teach you a lesson. What do we do now? - Let's go to the toilet. - What for?! - We may find a way out there. - You're going nowhere. - Where are Asprin and Strepsil? - In the pharmacy. - My name's Asprin. - I'm Strepsil. - I found you at last. - Get him! You're a dead man! - Wait! Is he a friend of yours? - No! I thought he was your friend. I don't know him either! - He didn't seem very friendly. - Yeah, you're right. Climb over the fence. Quick! Let's get inside. - Have you ever seen these guys? - Hard to say. I can remember all the beautiful women I've seen before. But I don't normally look at men. Listen, are you trying to play some kind of game or what? Have you seen those two men or not? I haven't! I swear I haven't. - I mean, yes, I have. - Tell me, where have you seen them? - Just now, right there. - What? Are you sure? If I'm not mistaken, they're right behind you. Wait a minute. They seem to be looking for someone. Can't you remember? Have you upset anyone recently? - I remember now. - Who is it? - We've stolen something from him. - So he's out for revenge! Yes. Think about it! Why would he chase us? It's all your fault! Stealing from gangsters. - How did I know he was a gangster? - Shut up! - He won't find us in here. Drink? - No thanks. Waiter... Don't move, or I'll break your fingers and kill you. Let's go to the toilets. Follow them. My friend, take it easy! Get in there! - It's none of your business. Go! - No problem! - It's nothing to do with us either. - Give it to me and I'll let you go. We don't know what you mean. - Where's that passport you stole? - We don't have it! You're not getting another chance. Hold it, CID. Come on. Here, we'll block the door. The curtains. Don't be so edgy. Cut it out! I didn't mean to. - What are you doing? - Help me. In case they come back. If they do come back, they'll get in here by any means. How can you stay so calm? If we panic, it will make it worse. You aren't panicking? - I'm trying to have a cigarette. - By burning the filter? Asprin, you get it. - Is that the Chinese takeaway? - No! - Is there a safe place to hide? - Yes! Do you want to go? - Yes! - Let's go. Great! Another one. My lucky day. I'll get my quota. - What is this? - Can't you see? Don't waste your time issuing a ticket. Only one ticket may be issued to one vehicle, not two tickets. I'm only giving one ticket. - What about this? Shall I rip it up? - Yes! I've been waiting all afternoon for this and you come and ruin it all. My only job is to issue tickets. But you can do other things - arrest street hawkers, robbers, vagabonds and so on and so on! I'm just a cop, not the Special Branch. And I saw it first. - We' re not going to argue, are we? - No. fight, maybe. An argument or a fight! Whatever, I'm ready! Are you really? You can hit me first. No. You hit me first. Assaulting a warden is a criminal offence. If you hit me, then you're off to jail! - I dare you! I dare you! - Go on, hit me. - I'm going to hit you, so what? - Go on, then. Come on. - You hit me first! - Hit me first! - What's going on? - None of your business. We're trying to help you. We're on your side, we'll help you. Right! If you want to help me, go get him. I'm a warden! Can't you see the uniform? If you touch me, you'll be in serious trouble. Not as much trouble as assaulting a policeman! - Let's go get him. - Stop! Here's the ticket! Move it. Sir, what happened? An uneven contest, that's what happened. - Well done, sir. How'd you do it? - It wasn't easy. Really? - You're getting to old for this. - You... He's being nice to you and telling you the truth. Shut up, will you? This way. - This way. - Hi, George. Long time no see. - Did you pick up these guys? - Take care of them. What's the charge? - Causing a disturbance in public. - Were they pissing on the street? Or were they having sex in public? Come on! Tell them the truth. What does he mean? Tell them we assaulted an officer. - You assaulted George? - Ken! - Don't get carried away. - It's her! Why are you here? - It's you two again. - Yeah. We assaulted an officer. Come on, put us in jail. Are you OK? Do you want to see the doctor? - I'm fine. Don't worry. - In that case, release them. - Release them? - You said you were fine. - So no damage done. - So we can go? But we beat him up good! But he's forgiven you so you're free to go. Really?! But it's dangerous. - I doubt you'll be that dangerous. - No. I mean we'll be in danger. What could be dangerous to you? You may go now. Really? Let's go. Come on! - Wait. Are you really leaving? - What else can we do? I've got an idea, and we'll have nothing to lose. What is it? - Let's rip off her clothes. - No. Why not? There's a psycho out there. - Indecent assault? - We've got to do it. - You're still here? - Yes. We want to tell you something. Tell me, then. It's not fair. They're using us as bait for the killer. I'm worried that when the killer appears, it'll be too late for us. I'm worried about that, too. It's your fault, I've been beaten up twice today. - Do you want to get revenge? - Is your idea going to work? - Yeah! - Where are you going? - We'll take you to the big boss. - Get in. - Surprised to see us? - Put it down. Sure. Where do you want it? Here? Here? - This frame doesn't count. - No way! We should let the boys handle this. Lets go. OK, let's go. Didn't you have enough last time? You want more? What?! Leave it. Come and fight me like a man. - They've gone. - I know. - Who's gone? - The ladies. Now I know what they mean when they say "we're in deep shit." - Someone here to see you. - Let them in. Come on in. - What are you doing here? - Come in. Traitors! You left us without saying a word. Look at us! Our deal was you lead us to the killer. We're not your bodyguards. The killer showed up at the pool hall before. Keep away from there because we're not going to use you as bait. So we're not protected now? I'd rather go to prison. That only means you'll be safe for a while. The best thing is to help us and give us all the stuff you stole from that hotel. As soon as we arrest the boss, you'll be safe wherever you go. We don't know what you're talking about. If you don't, maybe your friend Panadol might. You've talked to him? That's how we know you stole the passport. - So Panadol turned us in? - No! We got ourselves into this. - How do you know he's not behind it? - Because he's my friend. Go and ask him yourselves, then everything will be clear. - Who is it? - Police raid! - There's no one here. - We Asprin and me. Open the door. I don't open my door to liars. My finger hurts. - That serves you right! I bet... - Piss off! Move! What are you doing? - What are you doing? - I'm looking for something. Stop wrecking my place. Go away! If I find it here, I'll kill you. - Calm down. Let's talk to him. - I don't think he'll say anything! - Was anything inside that passport? - Like what? I told you he wouldn't help us. He must have taken it himself. - Bullshit! Shut up! - Give it to me and I'll shut up. I'll beat you up right now. Take it easy. Someone's trying to kill Asprin and me. It must be something to do with the passport. You got any ideas? Of course not! I told you! He doesn't give a damn. I was almost killed because of the passport and I also spent two days in jail. - I was forced to confess. - Move! So it was you who betrayed us after all! I didn't turn you in. If I wanted to be nasty, I'd use this! I'd use... Calm down! Give me that knife. Panadol, tell me who you've sold the passport to, I'll buy it back. - It's important. What do you say? - Even you don't trust me! Get out of here! Go on! - I won't leave till I get it! - Come on. I don't know what you're talking about. I won't take any stuff from you from now on. Our friendship's over. It's finished. You don't trust me. You've hurt my pride. Get out of here. I've got work to do. - Maybe he hasn't got it. - Where could it be, then? We know what he's like. I never believe what he says. - Do you want me to throw you out? - Come on! Don't get upset. We're leaving. Let's go. - Come back! - Why? Want to fight? No, I don't want to fight. Look! What is it, Panadol? It looks like a contract. - What is it? - Stupid! You can't read. What does it say? - It says we'll be rich. - Rich?! - You're kidding! - I never joke about money. If we give this to the cops, Tin's holdings will go bankrupt. How come? This shows the contract is a forgery. - No wonder we've been getting heat. - How can we get rich with this? If Tin knows we have this, how much will he pay to buy it back? - The more the better. - No way! Not even a penny! I say we give it to the police. Who's got it? - I've got it. - Give it to me. - Does he agree with you? - You... I've got to pee. Can't you be a little flexible? This is our opportunity. We're doing this for our master. You know it's a bad idea. Give it here. What if we vote on it? Ask Panadol. - I agree! - What do you agree with? I agree with you. Give it to the police. Then you'd better take it. Don't get in trouble. If he does, we'll get an attorney. Are you crazy? Do you know how much they cost? Now, you stop quarrelling. I'm going to see our master. No more fighting, right? All those years arguing and now we're best friends! Don't spoil it again by quarrelling! See? When it's money, we get along just fine. - Don't forget it was my idea. - And a brilliant one. Where is it? As far I'm concerned, you can put me in prison. But the problem is our old master. He has a bad heart, he's diabetic. Don't exaggerate. Your master is in good health. He even wolf-whistled at me. You don't know... Yes, I know everything. But you're not going to prison. If you're a good citizen, you'll cooperate with us and you'll see the police are fair. I'm grad to hear it. But I have a question. What? The microfilm. Now that I've given it to you, if... A reward? Is that you want? No, forget it. It doesn't matter. - May I help you? - Inspector Ng, CID. Hold on. This is CID, Mr Tin. We're here to arrest you. - You'd better go. - Right. - Are you Mr Henry Tin? - Yes. What do you want? We suspect you of forgery concerning a real estate transaction. Forgery? Have you got any proof? Don't worry. We have all the proof we need. Telephone, Boss. You can't do this. Don't worry. The evidence the police have is fake. Just keep clam. We'll be in touch later. And get the money ready. What should I do? You can remain silent, but anything you say could be used as evidence. If there is no evidence, my lawyer will file a lawsuit against you. Mr Tin, would you come with us? Boss, nice to see you. You must be the young ladies I've heard so much about. I'm afraid your evidence... doesn't stand up. Don't just stand there, let him go! - But, sir. - What's the matter with you two? Before you arrest anyone, you're meant to check with me. Mr Tin's going to sue us. As they are both under your command, why didn't you know about this? Don't get smart with me. You be careful, I'll get enough evidence. Are you threatening us? Do you want me to sue you for that, too? I'm sure you're very charming ladies. And there is no doubt that you are very good at your job. You have brought me here, but I still have respect for you. But when you make a mistake, you should apologise. Am I right? Mr Tin, we're sorry. Maybe next time you'll be more careful. You're only women, if you want to show off, do it in the kitchen. I won't make that mistake again. Next time, I'll put you behind bars. Did you hear that, Mr Wong? Your officers are very rude. I can't take this any more. I'll see you in the courtroom. We'll get you sooner or later. You underestimate your opponent. You may well live to regret it! These are two flight tickets. I'm not even going to comment. We all know Mr Tin's standing. You can go back to England. You can go on holiday. Forget this case. I'm taking over. Thanks, sir. I won't put you in an awkward position. - What's this? - I quit, but I'll try to nail him. You got the message so I won't repeat it in English. Get in. Who's in charge here? I want to see him. He's one of them. I'm the boss. Please sit. Tell me how we can recover our microfilm. Don't you offer your guests a drink? Mad-dog. Would you like a brandy or a whiskey? Nothing for me, thanks. Well, go on, I'm all ears. I hope you're enjoying the service. - Mr Tin, am I overdoing it? - You?! Of course you're not. - You're sure? - You're handling it wonderfully. When you hold all the aces in a game, it's hard to be modest. But it depends on what game you're playing. If you're playing blackjack and you have all the aces, it's useless. You've already lost the game. I didn't mean the game of blackjack. I hope you don't mind. Of course not, I've never lost any game. Then we're agreed? Ten million and you'll have the microfilm. Ten million? That's a lot of money. Which hand can you use to count all those notes? Don't try to threaten me. I have to go now. Tell your men to behave themselves. I don't want to feel threatened. If I don't get back, my friend will send the microfilm to the police. I forgot to tell you. My partner is very punctual. If I'm not back on time, then it'll be too late for you. I'd love to stay longer, but some other time. Just like the other parasites, kidnappers, pimps, the only thing that interests you is money. You are hardly an exception. Once I've fixed you, I'll fix your partner, too. We'll see which one holds out the longest. So you're gambling? You're double bluffing, aren't you? You'd better believe it. The stakes are high and I do not intend to lose. Where's your partner hiding? Asprin forgot his keys again. What's the matter with you? You stay out all night, no phone call. Is it so difficult to call? Wait! - I'm naked! - Why did you give us the fake film? It's fake? It can't be. Why don't you just cooperate and give us the real film? Or you'll both go to jail. So it really is fake? I see. Panadol switched the negatives. Hang on, I'll get dressed. My patience isn't going to last. Tell me or I'll kill you. You can kill me, if you hand over Asprin and the money first. Look, I'll hand over your buddy and the money. Where is the film? How can I trust you? I want a guarantee. Guarantee? - This is the quarantee. - Really? - Where is it? - I'll tell you! It's in the toilet. - Where is it? - Under the breast. - Is this another forgery? - What do you think? You've got us. Now tell your boss to release my friend. Why should I? I forgot to tell you I've been given a job to complete. And I intend to complete it. Your time's up. Unlucky for you. - Don't miss from this range. - OK, I won't disappoint you. Panadol! Stop exaggerating. You need one more before you die. You can kill me if you want to. By the way, I've been lying to people for my whole life. If you give that microfilm to your boss, you're in trouble! Where is the real one? - It's too late, isn't it? - Panadol! - Behind you! - Don't move. I told you it wasn't a good idea. Now Asprin's been kidnapped and you're hurt. What am I going to tell the master? I'll take you to hospital. No, it's too late. Go and rescue Asprin first. The microfilm I gave him is a forgery. The real one's in the money box. Go find Asprin. Go on! Just be quiet. I'll take you to hospital. - Is he OK? - I'm taking him to hospital. Strepsil, he's dead. No, he can't be! Panadol! Wake up! You can't be dead. Wake up! Can you hear me? It's too late, he's dead. Just give us the microfilm and we'll take care of it. This is your fault. You killed him! I'll kill you, bitch! - Stop it. - Go away. Don't move or I'll shoot. - What are you doing? - Go inside. Go on. - Yes? - Your boss is expecting me. Don't move. take me to your boss. Go on! Stay back or I'll blow your heads off. Take me to your boss. Come on. - Where's your boss? - So, it's you again? But don't you think you're out of your depth? Cut the bullshit. Where's Asprin? Don't worry. Hand over the microfilm and he'll be free. It's in the box. No tricks, OK? Or we'll all die. Do you know how to use a greande, my friend? Look out! Asshole! Get him. Hold it! Move and I'll shoot! I'm not afraid of you! - There's no blood! - Another fake. - Get him. - Right! Hol it! Come any closer and I'll shoot! Another fake? One of them is real, but I don't know which one. Do you want to take a chance? Here! It's fake. Get him. Are you sure? What if it's a real gun? It's a fake gun. You don't scare me. - Put it away. - We'll see who's scared! Boss, be careful. What's the matter? Pull the trigger. - Come on- - Keep back! Keep back. I'm still alive, Boss. Now what? Are they real guns? It's no use, they're all fakes. - Get him. - Yes, sir! Stop! I have the microfilm. Get back. How could you be so rude to my guest? Go get Asprin and it'll be yours. Good! That's what I admire. I wish all my men were like you. - If only you worked for me. - Cut it out. Go get Asprin. I've got the money box! The microfilm's in here. - You idiot! - Now I see why you're the boss. The film's here. Now, where is Asprin? Stop or I'll burn it. Just go ahead. You'll be doing me a favour. If you burn it, the police will have no evidence. Oh, right. Too late! I swallowed it. We can get it back...by using this. No, don't do that. I don't want to be too cruel. Burn him. Bastard! I'll come back to haunt you. To be honest, I couldn't care. This'll teach you to make fun of me. You're going to die now. - Let's see you burn! - Hold- it! Get back. - Put it down. - Forget it. It's another fake! Put him out. How dare you come here with your weapons! We've caught you red-handed. - You're going to jail this time. - Really? Where's your evidence? The microfilm is in my stomach! - I know that. Cut him open. - Yes, sir. Drop your guns or my men will kill him. Don't listen! You can't trust him. No! Put down your weapon. Put it down! It's not loaded. Shut the door. Let's see how good you ladies are without your weapons. - Get them. - Yes, sir. - Are you all right? - This is nothing. Watch out for those two behind you. Typical women. Always talking. Right. That's why their tongues are longer. Don't forget, among those women are your mothers. Don't insult my mother. I'll cut your tongue out. So you like playing with knives. Watch out for his knife, be careful. I don't need a knife to fight a woman. Are you sure you don't need a knife? Why are you wasting time talking? The ladies want to fight, let's do it. Ready? As ready as you are. Use your knife before it's too late! I'm sorry, I didn't mean it. I'm sorry, but I did mean it. Isn't my knife sharp?! So you still need it. I'll do this any way I want. Hold it! - Take us to your boss. - Move! Come on! Don't move. Don't move or I'll kill him. Are you OK? - You come here and I'll let him go. - Don't trust him! Don't hurt him. He's my only friend now. - I didn't swallow it. - Don't come up here. Here, I've got it! Are you OK? Don't move! Back off. - Don't do it. - It's a fake. - You got a problem? - It's my neck! - Don't move. - I've got to find that revolver. Don't worry. Here... Stop. - You mustn't kill him. - Keep out of it. Nobody move. Put down the gun. Boss! Come on. - Are you all right, Boss? - Fine. - What's going on? - They are trespassing on my grounds. Gary, take them away. - But, sir! - Move it. Madam, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, too. You'll be charged with trespassing and illegal use of weapons. They came here to rescue me. I had the evidence to nail Tin. - What evidence? - The microfilm. - Where is it? - They burnt it. That's unbelievable. Just take them away. Shut up. I'll decide what to do. He isn't telling you what to do, only what you ought to do, sir. Take them to the station. Mr Tin, you're coming, too. No problem. To be honest, it'd be a pleasure. You can be assured of my full cooperation. - Let's go. - Yes, sir. I feel I've upset you. Take no notice of my laugh. If you can't have a laugh, what can you do? It's all your fault. I said it wouldn't work. It was all Panadol's idea. - Panadol's gone. - He's run off! Where? Tell me where he's gone to. He's dead. - This son of a bitch killed him! - Move it. You bastard! Is there any justice? Justice? There is justice everywhere. The bad guys have been arrested or are out of action and the good guys like me will live happily ever after. Come on. Asprin, finish him off!
