My mind beats on and no words come. Taxing, tiring unyielding, unproductive my mind beats on. No sleep restores me. I, Aschenbach, famous as a master-writer successful, honoured self-discipline my strength, routine the order of my days imagination servant of my will. My mind beats on. Why am I now at a loss? I reject the words called forth by passion. I suspect the easy judgement of the heart. Now passion itself has left me and delight in fastidious choice. My mind beats on and I am at an end. O tender leaves and tardy spring refresh me! How solitary it is here the silent graveyard and the silent dead. ‵They enter into the house of the Lord.′ Yes! From the black rectangular hole in the ground. ‵May light everlasting shine upon them.′ Light everlasting? Would that the light of inspiration had not left me. Who's that? A foreigner, a traveller, no doubt. From beyond the Alps, by his looks. How he stares. A rude, insolent fellow. I won't, don't want to notice him. Marvels unfold! A wilderness, swollen with fearful growth monstrous and thick and heady flowers crowd in the steaming marsh. Trees, distorted as a dream drop naked roots into a glass-green pool where float great milk-white blooms. And at the stagnant edge huge birds stand hunched and motionless. Strange, strange hallucination inexplicable longing. See! In the knotted bamboo grove (O terror and delight) a sudden predatory gleam in the crouching tiger's eyes. What is this urge that fills my tired heart... Marvels unfold! A thirst, a leaping wild unrest a deep desire! No boundaries hold you. Go, travel to the South. Great poets before you have listened to its voice. Gone, he's gone as suddenly as he came the traveller from beyond the Alps. Should I go too beyond the mountains? Should I let impulse be my guide? Should I give up the fruitless struggle with the word? I have always kept a close watch over my development as a writer over my behaviour as a man. Should I now, without thought, break my habit my summer of work in the mountains to holiday in the warm and lovely south? The break can be justified of course by this growing fatigue that no-one must suspect and that I must not betray by any sign of flagging inspiration. Yes, it can be justified but the truth is that it has been precipitated by a sudden desire for the unknown. So be it! I will pursue this freedom and offer up my days to the sun and the south. My ordered soul shall be refreshed at last. Hey there, hey there, you! You come along with us, come along do! Not with you, not very likely, not with you! Aren′t you old enough to leave home? ‵Serenissima, Serenissima.′ - You be quiet! Let the girls alone, there are plenty where we′re going. ...plenty where we′re going. Look out for the girls over there! - They′ll hook you, they will! They′ll trap you, they will! They′ll get you, they will! They will! Thanks, we can look after ourselves! Ho! Here comes young Casanova, there, him with the hat. He′ll make trouble! Me Casanova? Me make trouble? I don′t know what trouble is, do I, boys? Doesn′t know what trouble is, does he, boys? Come on, cara mia! We′ll be nice to you. - Hi, come back! Come Back! Leave me alone, boys! I say, we′re off! You′re off! Too late! Be careful do! Addio! We′ll meet in the Piazza, the flags will be flying and outside San Marco the girls we′ll be eyeing. Hush boys, quiet! We have a noble companion on board. We′ll sit in the Piazza, the band will be playing but inside San Marco they′re singing and praying. Greetings, Conte! Bound for Serenissima, I′m sure. Why, he′s old! He′s not young at all. But you look doubtful? Pray don′t change your mind, you won′t regret it! Venice, an excellent choice, you′ll find everything you′re wanting. Won′t he, boys? The bells of San Marco call us to our duty but I′ll leave the Piazza and follow my beauty. Ugh! How can they bear that counterfeit, that young-old horror? A wretched lot, a wretched boat. Do you want a chair, Signore? Yes, put it there, away from the young men. What romantic notion made me want to come by sea? ‵Serenissima.′ Low-lying clouds, unending grey. Beneath the sombre dome the empty plain of the sea. ‵Row us over to Serenissima.′ Hush, boys, the Conte is dreaming! Dreaming of love and Serenissima. Where is the welcome that my Venice always gave me? Here we are, here we are! Wait for me, I′m coming too, I want my beauty, hurrah! Au revoir, Conte! Pray keep us in mind and, by the way our love to the pretty little darling - don′t you know! Ah Serenissima! Where should I come but to you to soothe and revive me where but to you, to live that magical life between the sea and the city? What lies in wait for me here, Ambiguous Venice where water is married to stone and passion confuses the senses? Ambiguous Venice. Passengers must follow, follow where I lead. No choice for the living, no choice for the dead. Where is the man going? I want to go to Schiavone. The Signore is going to the Lido. Yes, by vaporetto. The Signore cannot go by vaporetto, the vaporetto does not take baggage. That is my affair; you will turn round. Nobody shall bid me. I go where I choose. I go my own way, I have nothing to lose. Is it money he′s after? The Signore will pay. I will pay nothing if you do not take me where I want to go. To the Lido. But not with you. I row you well. True, he rows well. I shall leave him alone - They know how I row them! go back to my dreams - They take what I give to the sway of the boat - but nobody shall bid me and the indolent lapping waves. - not while I live. Bride of the sea... True bride for me... Gossip and stroll - - Eye every girl Choose the right one - - Make her your own If she won′t come - - Leave her alone Loiter and play... Tease every boy... You play too long - - I′ll change my song Mille grazie, Signore. Row us over. - Tanti auguri. Addio, addio... Nobody shall bid me. I do what I want to, I′m not out to please. Buon giorno, Signore. Piano, piano! This way, Signore, prego. One moment please, I have not paid the gondolier. Why, he′s gone - gone without his money. He made off, Signore, a bad lot. He was recognised here, a bad lot. A man we don′t trust. A man without a licence. But the Signore is lucky, he had his gondola ride for nothing. Mysterious gondola a different world surrounds you a timeless, legendary world of dark, lawless errands in the watery night. How black a gondola is - black, coffin black a vision of death itself and the last silent voyage. Yes, he rowed me well. But he might have done for me, rowed me across the Styx and I should have faded like echoes in the lagoon to nothingness. We are delighted to greet the Signore to our excellent hotel. We trust the Signore had a pleasant journey. He will have a pleasant sojourn, I am sure. The Signore was wise to come to the Lido by gondola not so fast as the boat, but pleasanter, far pleasanter. That was not my intention. Just so, but a happy chance nonetheless. And here is the room, as you commanded, and look, Signore, the view! The view of the beach from our rooms is superb, from this one especially. Thank you, it will do very well. And here, Signore, outside your room, but private, unfrequented you may sit and see the world go by. For men of letters, like the Signore, take pleasure in the contemplation of their fellows... Thank you. ...for the Signore is well known in our country. Thank you, very nice, quite satisfactory. Prego, egregio Signor von Aschenbach. So I am led to Venice once again -egregio Signor von Aschenbach! The writer who has found a way to reconcile art and honours the lofty purity of whose style has been officially recognised and who has accepted, even welcomed the austere demands of maturity. Yes, I turned away from the paradox and daring of my youth renounced bohemianism and sympathy with the outcast soul to concentrate upon simplicity, beauty, form. Upon these all my art is built. Now, in this beautiful, agreeable place I intend to give myself to the leisured world for a spell. A pleasant journey, did he say? The whole experience was odd, unreal, out of normal focus. Was I wrong to come, what is there in store for me here? But there is the sea and nearby Serenissima though the sky is still grey, the air heavy, a hint of scirocco. How I love the sound of the long low waves rhythmic upon the sand. The Lido is so charming, is it not? But here the sound is of another kind. Mama, when will dinner be served? Be quiet, Bérénice, that′s enough! - I am starving. And this hotel is all that one could wish. That was a most interesting excursion. - Most interesting. We should have Mario guide us again tomorrow. Mario? Mario! And Venice is so close one is not bored beside the sea. Come, my child, tell us what the waves are saying to you. One meets one′s friends from everywhere - from Warsaw! If tomorrow is fine then we will go to the islands. And Denmark! It is so hot. What was that you said, dear? And Moscow! Fa-la-lay and fa-la-lou... white snow falling on the ground... Grey hares run, don′t make a sound, hunters searching all around. Fa-la-lay and I caught you! In Mummy′s presence one must behave properly. So civilised, quite so. So elegant, quite so. So ‵comme il faut′, don′t you know. Signori! II ristorante, al vostro servizio. United in their formal ways in the ease that wide horizons bring. Well-mannered murmurs of a large hotel. Poles, I should think, governess, with her children a beautiful young creature, the boy. Surely the soul of Greece lies in that bright perfection. A golden look, a timeless air... mortal child with more than mortal grace. How does such beauty come about? What mysterious harmony between the individual and the universal law produces such perfection of form? Would the child be less good, less valuable as a human being if he were less beautiful? The fact is that in that disciplined family, beauty dominates. The severe, plain little girls must be quiet, demure. The elegant boy may show off his grace. No doubt Mama with her fabulous pearls indulges herself in a pampering partial love just as I indulge myself in these novelist′s speculations. There is indeed in every artist′s nature a wanton and treacherous proneness to side with beauty. The wind is from the West a lazy sea the sky overcast a stagnant smell from the lagoon. My temples throb, I cannot work. O Serenissima, be kind or I must leave just as once I left before. Le bele fragole, la bela, bela ua. Fine strawberries, Signori, fresh today. Grassie, Signore... Bellissime! I′ll stay, I cannot leave. What can be better than the sea? What can be better than this? Ah, how peaceful to contemplate the sea immeasurable, unorganised, void. I long to find rest in perfection and is not this a form of perfection? Ah, here comes Eros - his very self. I was not mistaken, it is very good. So the little Polish god is proud, proud like all his race. He is human after all. There is a dark side even to perfection. I like that. Adziù! What is it they call him, Adziù! Adziù? They call him Adziù! Tadziù! Tadziù! Tadziù! That is it... from Thaddeus, short for Thaddeus. Tadzio. Tadziù! So, my little beauty you notice when you′re noticed, do you? As one who strives to create beauty to liberate from the marble mass of language the slender forms of an art I might have created him. Perhaps that is why I feel a father′s pleasure a father′s warmth in the contemplation of him. Yes, Aschenbach, you have grown reserved self-sufficient since the death of a wife and marriage of an only daughter dependent not upon human relationships but upon work, and again - work. How much better to live, not words but beauty to exist in it, and of it. How much better than my detached and solitary way. Aou′! Stagando, aou′! Guida, guida! Let me guide the Signore. I can find him places he doesn′t know, places to delight him. While this scirocco blows nothing delights me. My head is heavy, my eyelids ache. Guardi, Signore, see the beautiful silks and lace. Tutto a buon mercato. Venga qui, Signore, look at my beautiful glass. Tutto a buon mercato. Foul exhalations rise under the bridges oppress my breathing, dispel my joy. La carità, la carità! II padre is sick, the bambini are hungry la carità. Provi, Signore! Vongole, granseole, aragosta, gamberetti, mazanette, calamaretti molto buon′. Provi, Signore! The rubbish stirs in gusts over the piazzas. Venga qui, Signore, look at my beautiful glass. Every doorway harbours feverish fears. Guardi, Signore, see the beautiful lace. O Serenissima, I fear you in this mood. Guida, guida, Signore! I can find you places you do not know, places to delight you. Enough, I must leave, I must go away. Back to the mountains - and the fresh mountain air. But where? Where can I go? Aou′! I must leave this unfriendly lagoon. Aou′! De longo aou′! Horrible, evil, nauseous. I must go elsewhere. I must find a clearer sky, a fresher air. Naturally, Signore, I understand. How regrettable, unfortunate. We shall be sorry to lose you but of course if the Signore has reasons then he must go. No doubt the Signore will return to us in his own good time. Meanwhile our deepest respects and please keep us in mind. Arrivederci, Signore! Giulio, veni qui. The Signore′s baggage.Presto! Presto! Sì, pronto! Sì, sì. It is here. The motor boat is waiting. It is too soon, you allow too much time. I will not be hurried. I will follow by gondola. Bene, Signore. Yes, I must go - but does it seem fresher this morning? Can the wind have changed? For the last time, Tadziù, it was too brief, all too brief. May God bless you. Aou′! Premando aou′! Shall I never see these columns rise again? Never see the marble brows upon each curving bridge? O Serenissima! Why did I yield so quickly to my fears? There you are, Signore, just in time. You have my baggage? Safe, Signore, gone on the train to Como. Gone to Como? That is not where I′m going. Sorry, Signore.Mi dispiace, Signore. You must find it - get it back. Without it, I cannot go. You understand? I cannot go. I shall return to the hotel. Arrange for the baggage to be sent back there. Very good, Signore. In the twinkling of an eye it shall be back. Gondoliere, to the Lido at once! I am become like one of my early heroes passive in the face of fate. What do I really want? First I am grief-stricken but must go because of the danger to my health. Then I am furious because I am forced to return but secretly I rejoice. Vacillating, irresolute, absurd. Aou′! The whole experience has been disruptive to my thoughts and to my work yet in spite of it I feel my spirits rise. Often what is called disruptive is not directed against life but is invigorating, a renewal... A thousand apologies to the Signore. I would not have discommoded him for the world. And now the Signore will find the wind is blowing from the healthier quarter. The wind blows sweetly from the East. Now the Signore can holiday at ease. He can enjoy what he thought to have left for ever. Ah, Tadzio, the charming Tadzio, that′s what it was. That′s what made it hard to leave. So be it. Here I will stay, here dedicate my days to the sun to the sun and Apollo himself. Beneath a dazzling sky the sea... The sea rolls silken-white. Calm morning hours drift on, drift on to scented dusk and melting night. Day after carefree day the idle minutes run while he, transported to the antique world, lives in Elysium. He who loves beauty worships me. Mine is the spell that binds his days. No boy, but Phoebus of the golden hair driving his horses through the azure sky mounting his living chariot shoulder high both child and god he lords it in the air. No boy, but Phoebus of the golden hair. Love that beauty causes is frenzy god-inspired nearer to the gods than sanity. Phaedrus learned what beauty is from Socrates beneath the tree. Beauty is the only form of spirit that our eyes can see so brings to the outcast soul reflections of Divinity. At the feasts of the sun see my devotees contest in strength, agility and skill the body′s praise. First, the race! Run, run, get ready, go! Foot by foot outpace one another with flashing forms, legs, thighs, working arms. Next, to the pit. Try your skill turn by turn, heaving breath - Go! Springing high gather limbs, time the moment - Go! Now release shooting forward, legs and arms flinging forth skim, and land with thudding heel. Go! Now, the throw! Young discobolus, tensing body bent weighs the swelling stone firm upon the hand swinging back and up, gathering all his force arching wider still. Hurling now, hurling the discus. Young discobolus! On tip-toe rise! Up and over! Graceful turn and drop higher each one the heavens attempt triumphant flying, free in weightless flight. Yet to the earth at last the shaft is bound. For skill and strength this is the final test! Measure to fight, face your man forehead to forehead, fist to fist limbs coiled round limbs, panting with strain tear apart and close again. Immobile now - tensing, tensing! Panther-like, a shoulder throw. Who is the victor? Praise, praise my power. - Tadzio has won. Crown him with olive! Beauty is the mirror of spirit. - Tadzio is victor. The boy, Tadzio, shall inspire me. His pure lines shall form my style. The power of beauty sets me free. I will write what the world waits for, rejoicing in his presence. When thought becomes feeling, feeling thought... When the mind bows low before beauty... When nature perceives the ecstatic moment... When genius leaves contemplation for one moment of reality... Then Eros is in the word. Eros... Ah Tadzio, the victor, the admiration of all, I must say well done. I will speak to him, we will become friends. It is easy, nothing more natural. Too late, I couldn′t... couldn′t do it. This is frenzy, absurd. The heat of the sun must have made me ill. So longing passes back and forth between life and the mind. Ah! Don′t smile like that! No one should be smiled at like that. I... love you. So, it has come to this. I can find no better description of my state than the hackneyed words ‵I love you′. Overcome by beauty, I tried, quite simply, to use the emotion released for my own creation. What I wrote was good, quite what was expected of me; to the point, yet poignant. But when it was done I felt degraded - as if I had taken part in an orgy. Then I was moved to put this relationship if so onesided an affair can be called a relationship on to a natural footing. I would hail the boy, exchange a few words with him. I couldn′t do it. My beating heart and trembling limbs refused to obey my will. So I had to mock myself as the crestfallen lover. Who really understands the workings of the creative mind? Nonetheless, ‵so be it′. This ‵I love you′ must be accepted ridiculous but sacred too and no, not dishonourable even in these circumstances. Guardate, Signore! Va bene, Signore? Move the head to the left. Yes, the weather is idyllic. Too hot? O, just a trifle. The hotel guests are fewer? Guardate, Signore! Va bene, Signore? Your head down, if you please. But what was that you′re saying? You hear less German? Ah! Your compatriots are always very careful but so nice. Take the von Becks! I′ve tended Herr von Beck for many summers. A splendid head of hair if I may say so remarkable for someone in his middle years and such a youthful skin! Guardate, Signore! Each year they spend the summer with us. Va bene, Signore? But now after ten days they have gone gone back to the cold unwelcoming north. Head up just a little! The Signore is not leaving us? He does not fear the sickness, does he? Sickness! What sickness? Nothing, I know nothing. - But you mentioned it. It is not important, it is nothing. - You must know what you mean. It is not important. You fancy this oil, sir? A delectable scent, sir. The Signore now takes little interest in such things, I know. That is it, Signore. Next week at the same time? Va bene, Signore, egregio Signore. Prego, prego! Sickness? What sickness? More than a malaise from the scirocco? A sickness to drive people away? Do I detect a scent? A sweetish medicinal cleanliness overlaying the smell of still canals? Aou′! Aou′! How quiet the city is! What can they all be looking at? Citizens are advised to take precautions against infection. Citizens are advised not to eat shellfish in this unusually hot season. Citizens must not use the canal waters for household purposes. People are warned... warned... - Warned... warned... Everyone is warned. What is all this? The city fathers are seldom so solicitous. What is this sweetish smell that pervades the air, my friends? Scusi? What are these warnings? Just a formal precaution, sir. Police regulations, sir, with which we must conform. The air is sultry, the scirocco blows. - No, quite unimportant, sir, precautionary. Let me guide the Signore, I can find him... - Basta! Basta! Scusi, Signore! - La carità! The bambini are sick. La Stampa! Giornali tedeschi... II Mondo! German newspapers... Das TagbIatt, grazie. Grazie, Signore... La Stampa! Giornali inglesi... Let me see what my countrymen say. ‵Rumours of cholera in Venice officially denied. Rumours of an incipient plague in Venice officially denied.′ Ah, here it is. ‵We doubt the good faith of the Venetian city fathers in their refusal to admit to the cases of cholera in the city. German citizens should return as soon as possible.′ Ugh! Rumours, rumours. They should be silent. The city′s secret, growing darker every day like the secret in my own heart. They must receive no hint. They must not be told. They must not leave. And now I cannot let them out of sight, daily I watch and wander. Strange times of chance encounters, painful hopes, and silent communion. Careful search now leads me to them, cunning finds him out. My eyes are on him even at his prayer. Incense and sickness mingle in the air. Kyrie eleison, Christe eleison. Christe audi nos, Christe exaudi nos. Sancte Marce ora pro nobis. Ite, missa est. When I am near, he knows. As for me a calm untroubled face hides a panic fear yet am I driven on... - Fewer guests from smart hotels come to walk about our streets. - We who live by summer′s trade guard the city′s secret. - There′s no danger if we watch and do as we are told. - Under a burning sky the scirocco still blows. O voluptuous days! O the joy I suffer! Feverish chase, exquisite fear! The taste of knowledge, time gained by silence while the echoing cries answer from the labyrinth. Follow them! Aou′! De longo aou′! Aou′! Chiamate! Aou′! Stagando aou′! Ah, Tadzio, Eros, charmer! See, I am past all fear, blind to danger drunken, powerless sunk in the bliss of madness. Ah! Tadzio, Eros, charmer! Gustav von Aschenbach what is this path you have taken? What would your forebears say - decent, stern men in whose respectable name and under whose influence you, the artist, made the life of art into a service a hero′s life of struggle and abstinence? Yes, but when heroes have flourished Eros has flourished too. It was no shame to them to be enthralled. Rather it brought them praise, it brought them honour. This way for the players, Signori! Please, come this way. A rough lot of course, but you′ll enjoy it. Yes, they come each year; it is the custom. Take your places, Signori. The players are here, where are our places? The players are here to charm and delight us with quips and grimaces with old songs new turned, with new antics learned. To please and excite us, to woo and invite us the players are here, we′re in our places! O mio carino, how I need you near me. Just as the Siren needs the salt sea water. Dearest, I weep when you′re not near to hear me. And in my veins the blood begins to falter. Better by far if we had met and parted. I knew the Creed, but now I can′t get started. Can′t say the Gloria nor Ave Maria. How shall I save my soul,l′anima mia? Dearest, my life is guided by your beauty - Just as the North star guides the storm-tossed sailor. For you forgotten honour, work and duty. L′anima mia, how shall I save my soul? La mia nonna always used to tell me ‵Leave the blondes alone, Sonny sono tutte vagabonde!′ La mia mamma always used to tell me ‵Don′t you choose brunettes, Sonny sono tutte traditore!′ Padre mio always used to tell me ‵Never touch a redhead, Sonny sono tutte...′ So I shall never be able to marry -Evviva la libertà. A word, please. - Signore? Why are they disinfecting Venice? Orders, just orders. So there is no plague in Venice? Ha! That′s a good one, perhaps the scirocco′s a plague? Or the police, they are a plague! No, you′ve got it wrong, Signore! It′s the heat, the heat and the weather. Basta! Basta! Here, hands off! What did you say to the German Signore? Nothing. Let go! What did you say? Told him he was talking a lot of nonsense, that′s what I told him. Go on then, they′re waiting, and mind you, not a word. Do roses flower in the midst of ice? Does snow fall in August? Ha, ha, ha, ha, how ridiculous you are! Are there waves upon dry land, or ants in the middle of the sea? Does a young man want to give an old woman kisses? Does a pretty girl wish to marry an old man? Is a tired bird still any good at whistling? Ah, little Tadziù! We do not laugh like the others. Does your innocence keep you aloof or do you look to me for guidance? Do you look to me? So the moments pass and as they dwindle through the fragile neck dividing life from death I see them flow as once I saw the thread of sand slip through my father′s hour glass. One moment, if you please. We must go today, no later. - My ticket please. Information please, it is most urgent. - Please pay attention to me. Four places in the Wagon-lits for tonight. - But my dear young man... Four places - first class. - I said today. A hotel overnight, near the station. - Called to France - urgent business... Will you help me, please? - I cannot wait - I must go. I′m sorry, Signori, we are closed. Young man, why do all these people hurry to leave? The end of the season, sir. What are these warnings all over the city? The city always takes precautions in this weather. Is that the truth? Sir, that is what they say, what we are told to believe. But... - The truth! In these last years Asiatic cholera has spread from the delta of the Ganges to Hindustan, to China, Afghanistan and thence to Persia. They thought it would travel westwards by land but it came by sea, to the southern ports - Malaga, Palermo... Last May, two dead bodies were discovered here in Venice with signs of the plague. It was hushed up. In a week there were ten more - twenty - thirty. A guest from Austria went home and died hence the reports in the German newspapers. The authorities denied it. The city had never been healthier, they said. Sir, death is at work. The plague is with us. It flourishes, redoubles its powers. It is violent, convulsive, suffocating. Few who contract it recover. The Ospedale Civico is full. The traffic to San Michele is continuous. And, sir, the authorities are not moved by scruples or by international agreements. They fear for their pockets - if there should be panic or blockade... Meanwhile the city is demoralised. Crime, drunkenness, murder, organised vice. Evil forces are rife. Sir, take my advice. The blockade cannot be far off. Rather than put it off till tomorrow you would do well to leave today. Thank you, young man. Good night, sir, it is true, every word. So it is true, true, more fearful than I thought. I must warn them, warn the lady of the pearls, speak to her now. ‵Madame,′ I will say, ‵allow a perfect stranger to give you a warning.′ ‵Madame,′ I will say, ‵go away, at once. You are in danger. Venice is in the grip of a plague. Do you not see how everyone is leaving? You must go too, with your daughters and with... Tadzio, your son.′ ‵Madame,′ I will say, ‵Madame...′ So - I didn′t speak! Once again I have failed to make everything decent and above board missed the opportunity to become myself again missed the opportunity to regain my reason, my self-possession. But what is self-possession? What is reason, moral sense? What is art itself, compared to the rewards of chaos? The city′s secret, desperate, disastrous, destroying is my hope. I will not speak. What if all were dead, and only we two left alive? Receive the stranger god. No! Reject the abyss. Do not turn away from life. No! Abjure the knowledge that forgives. Do not refuse the mysteries. No! Love reason, beauty, form. He who denies the god, denies his nature. No! Be ruled by me and by my laws. Come! Beat on the drums. No! Stumble in the reeling dance. No! Goad the beasts with garlanded staves. Seize their horns, ride into the throng. Behold the sacrifice! I go, I go now. Taste it, taste the sacrifice. Join the worshippers. Embrace, laugh, cry to honour the god I am he! Aa-oo! It is true, it is all true. I can fall no further. O the taste of knowledge! Let the gods do what they will with me. Do what you will with me! Yes! A very wise decision, if I may say so. One should not neglect oneself in one′s middle life. Everyone should make a stand against advancing years. Guardate, Signore, egregio Signore! Grey? O just a trifle, due to lack of interest. You would not neglect your health? Your teeth? Then why refuse the use of cosmetics? Nothing ages a man like grey hair. Permit me to aid it just a little? Very wise. Magnificent. All the difference... Va bene, Signore? Now if we were to tone up the skin? O just a little, a very little! Signore, my forte... to bring back the appearance of youth... Va bene, Signore? Give some brilliance to the eyes... Nothing brightens a face like the eyes! Head back, Signore! Quite, quite still... An excellent subject, if I may say so. Guardate, Signore! Va bene, Signore? Prego, prego. A masterpiece, a masterpiece! Now the Signore can fall in love with a good grace. Prego, prego. Addio, Signore, egregio Signore! Hurrah for the Piazza, the pride of the city. All hail to San Marco, all hail to my beauty ‵the pretty little darling, don′t you know′. He saw me. He saw me, and did not betray me. Le bele fragole... La bela, bela ua. Fine strawberries. Grassie tante a voi, Signore... Signore, fresh today... Ugh, they are soft, musty, over-ripe! Chaos, chaos and sickness. What if all were dead and only we two left alive? O Aschenbach! Famous as a master... Self-discipline... your strength! All folly, all pretence! O perilous sweetness the wisdom poets crave. Socrates knew, Socrates told us. Does beauty lead to wisdom, Phaedrus? Yes, but through the senses. Can poets take this way then? For senses lead to passion, Phaedrus. Passion leads to knowledge knowledge to forgiveness to compassion with the abyss. Should we then reject it, Phaedrus the wisdom poets crave seeking only form and pure detachment simplicity and discipline? But this is beauty, Phaedrus discovered through the senses and senses lead to passion, Phaedrus and passion to the abyss. And now, Phaedrus, I will go. But you stay here and when your eyes no longer see me then you go too. The wind still blows from the land. The air is not good, it is hot and unnatural. The time of politeness and welcome to our excellent hotel is over. First one goes, then another goes - è capo? Soon we shall be all alone -è capo? Be silent! Where is the baggage of the lady of the pearls? Were you not told to bring it down? First one goes, then another goes then five go - è vero, capo? Begone! When guests arrive at my splendid hotel I welcome them, I show them the view. And when they go, by choice or chance. I′m here to say Addio! First one goes, now they all go. And the writing gentleman? Be silent! Who comes and goes is my affair. Buon giorno, Signor von Aschenbach. More departures? Signore, it is the time of departure. Our Polish friends? Precisely, Signore the lady and her family now return to their homes in the cold, cold north beyond the mountains. When? After luncheon, to be sure. Yes, Signor von Aschenbach, the season comes to an end. Our work is nearly done. No doubt the Signore will be leaving us soon? We must all lose what we think to enjoy the most. Ah, no! Adziù! Adziù!
