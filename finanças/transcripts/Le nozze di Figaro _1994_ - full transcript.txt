Five. Ten. Twenty. Thirty. Thirty-six. Forty-three. Yes, I am very pleased with this, it seems just made for me. Take a look, dear Figaro. Just look at this hat of mine. Yes, my dearest, it's very pretty, it looks just made for you. On this morning of our wedding how delightful to my dear one is this pretty little hat which Susanna made herself. What are you measuring, Figaro? I'm seeing if the bed the Count has put aside for us will go well here. - In this room? - Yes, his lordship's generously giving it to us. Keep it. Why? I've my reasons here. Why can't you tell me? Because I don't choose to. Are you my slave, or not? I don't understand why you so dislike the most convenient room in the palace. Because I'm Susanna and you're a dolt. Thanks, you're too flattering! Just see if it could go better anywhere else. Supposing my lady calls you at night: Ding ding, in two steps you can be there. Or if it should happen that his lordship should want me: Dong dong, in three bounds I'm there at his service. And supposing one morning the dear Count should ring: Ding ding, and send you three miles away. Dong dong, and the devil should lead him to my door. And in three bounds... Hush, hush, Susanna. - Listen. - Quick, tell me. If you wish to hear the rest, banish those suspicions which do me wrong. I burn to hear the rest: Doubts and suspicions freeze my blood. Banish those suspicions. Doubts and suspicions freeze my blood. Keep quiet and listen. What's there to tell? The Count, tired of scouring the countryside for fresh beauties, wants to try his luck again in his own palace, though it's not his wife who whets his appetite. - Who then? - Your little Susanna. - You? - The very same. He hopes that being so close will be useful to his noble plan. Bravo! Go on. This is the gracious favour, this is the care he bestows on you and your wife. Have you seen such condescension! There's better to come. Don Basilio, my singing teacher and his go-between, repeats this same theme daily when he gives me my lesson. Basilio? The scoundrel! Did you think he gave me a dowry because of your good looks? So I thought. He intends it to obtain from me certain half-hours which feudal privilege... What! Didn't the Count abolish that in his domain? He did, but now regrets it, and he wants to bring it back for me. Well! Very pretty. How charming of his lordship! He wants some fun: He'll get it. Who's ringing? The Countess. Goodbye, goodbye, Figaro, my dear. Courage, my dearest. And you be wary. Well done, my noble master! Now I begin to understand the secret and to see your whole scheme clearly. To London, isn't it? You go as minister, I as courier, and Susanna... confidential attach√©e. It shall not be, Figaro has said it. If, my dear Count, you feel like dancing, it's I who'll call the tune. If you'll come to my school, I'll teach you how to caper. I'll know how... But wait, I can uncover his secret design more easily by dissembling. Acting stealthily, acting openly, here stinging, there mocking, all your plots I'll overthrow. And you waited until his wedding day to tell me this? My dear doctor, I'm not giving up: A pretext often sufficed to break off engagements later than this, and besides this contract he has certain pledges to me I could mention... But enough: We must frighten Susanna; We must somehow make her reject the Count's advances. To revenge himself, he'll take my part, and so Figaro will become my husband. I'll do all I can: Tell me everything without reserve. I'd enjoy giving him my old servant for a wife for having stolen my intended from me. Revenge, yes, revenge is a pleasure meant for the intelligent. To forget insults and outrages is always low and base. With astuteness and acuteness, with judgement and discernment. I can do it. The case is serious. But, believe me, I'll bring it off. If I have to search the legal code and read the whole statute book, with a quibble or a paraphrase I'll find some obstacle. All Seville knows Bartolo: That rascal Figaro will be yours! All is not lost yet, I still have hopes. But here comes Susanna: Let's pretend not to see her. And that's the pearl of virtue he intends to marry! She's talking of me. One can't hope for anything better from Figaro: Money is everything. Spiteful tongue! Lucky everyone knows the worth of her words. Brava! Such discretion! And those modest eyes and demure expression, as well as... I'd better go. What a charming bride! Your humble servant, gracious lady. I'd not be so bold, worthy ma'am. - No, you go first. - No, no, after you. I know my place, I'd not so presume. A bride-to-be first. A lady-in-waiting. The Count's favourite. The toast of Spain. - Your qualities. - Your dress. - Your position. - Your age. I'll fly into a rage if I stay here any longer. Decrepit old witch, she's a laughing-stock. You old frump! Putting on high airs because you read two books and bored my lady in her youth. Susanna, is it you? It's me, what do you want? My dearest, what a misfortune! Your dearest! What's happened? Yesterday the Count found me alone with Barbarina and dismissed me. If the Countess, my lovely godmother, doesn't get me pardoned, I'll have to leave, I'll never see my dear Susanna again! Never see me again! Good! But doesn't your heart secretly sigh any longer for the Countess? She fills me with too much respect! How lucky you are to be able to see her whenever you wish! You dress her in the morning and undress her at night, you fix her pins, her laces. If only I could be in your place... What have you got there? Let me see. What a pretty ribbon, and the nightcap of so lovely a godmother. Give me it, my dear, I beg. Give it back at once! O dear, sweet, fortunate ribbon! I'll not give it up except with my life. What is this insolence? Go on, don't be angry! In exchange for it I'll give you this little song of mine. What can I do with it? Read it to my lady, read it for yourself, read it to Barbarina, Marcellina, read it to every woman in the palace. Poor Cherubino, have you gone mad? I no longer know who I am, now I'm burning, now I'm ice, every woman makes me change colour, every woman makes me tremble. At the very word love or beloved my heart leaps and pounds, and to speak of love fills me with a longing I can't explain! I speak of love when I'm awake, I speak of love in my dreams, to stream, shade and mountains, To flowers, grass and fountains, to the echo, the air, the breezes, which carry away with them the sound of my fond words. And if I've none to hear me. I speak of love to myself. - Ah, I'm lost! - Heavens! The Count! Woe is me! Susanna, you seem to be agitated and confused. My lord, pray excuse me... but... suppose... someone caught us... I beg you to leave. Just a moment and I'll leave you. Listen. I mustn't listen. Just two words. You know the king has appointed me ambassador in London. I planned to take Figaro with me. My lord, if you'd allow me... Speak, my dear, speak, and with that right which today you may assume of me as long as you live, ask, require, demand. Let me go, my lord. I claim no right, nor wish, nor intend to. I'm so unhappy! But no, Susanna, I want to make you happy! You well know how much I love you: Basilio has already told you. Now listen, if you'll give me a few minutes in the garden at dusk... For that favour, I'd pay... He's just gone out. - Who spoke? - Oh, heavens! - Go, and see no one enters. - And leave you alone? He'll be with my lady, I'll go and look for him. I'll get behind here. - Do not hide. - Hush, and get rid of him. Alas! What are you doing? Susanna, heaven be with you: Have you by any chance seen the Count? What should the Count be doing with me? Please go away. Just a moment, listen. Figaro's looking for him. Heavens! Only you hate Figaro more than he does. Let's see how I'm served. I've never heard that one who loves the wife must hate the husband. The Count loves you. Begone, base agent for another's lust: I don't need your propositions, your Count and his love. There's no harm done. Everyone to his own taste: I thought that for a lover you'd prefer, like any other woman, a generous, prudent and discreet nobleman to a youngster, a page-boy. To Cherubino? To Cherubino. To that amorous cherub who at daybreak was prowling about here trying to get in. Slanderer, it's an invention! To you, anyone who keeps his eyes open is a slanderer. And that little song? Tell me in confidence: I'm a friend and won't let it go any further, was it for you, or my lady? Who told him about that? By the way, you should warn him: At table he gazes at her so often and with such avidity, that if the Count noticed... On that point, you know, he's ferocious. You wretch! Why do you spread such lies? I. You wrong me! I sell only what I buy. I don't add a jot to what everyone is saying. Really, what is everyone saying? Very pretty! Oh, heaven! What do I hear? Go at once, and send the seducer packing. Go at once, and send the seducer packing. My presence is ill-timed. Pray excuse me, my lord. Unhappy me, I'm ruined! I'm overcome with misery. Ah, the poor child's fainted! Lord, how her heart is beating! Gently, on to this seat. Where am I? What's going on? How dare you! Go away! We're only helping you. - Your honour is quite safe. - Do not be alarmed, my dear. What I said about the page was only my suspicion. It's a plot, it's quite untrue, don't believe this deceiver. That young fop must go. Poor boy! Poor boy! I've found him out again. - How so? What? - What? How so? Yesterday I found your cousin's door locked. I knocked and Barbarina opened it more flustered than usual. My suspicions aroused by her appearance, I searched everywhere, and lifting very, very softly the tablecloth, there I saw the page! Ah, what do I see? Cruel heavens! Better and better! You paragon of virtue! - Nothing worse could come about. - Now I see how it is! Heavens, what's to happen? Every woman's alike! There's nothing new about it. Basilio, go off to Figaro at once: I want him to see this. And I want him to hear. Go on. Wait. What assurance! What's your excuse when your guilt is obvious? Virtue has no need of excuses. But when did he come in? He was with me when you came in. He was asking me to beg my lady to intercede for him. Your arrival threw him into confusion, and so he hid himself in there. But I stood there myself when I came in! Then I hid myself under the stair. And when I placed myself there? Then I quietly crept round and hid here. Heavens! Then he heard what I said to you? I did all I could not to hear. Deceitful boy! Someone's coming. And you're still here, you little viper! Blithe maids, scatter flowers before our noble lord. His generous heart has preserved intact for you the chaste purity of a still fairer flower. What's all this nonsense? - Back me up, my dear. - I'm not hopeful. My lord, do not disdain this humble expression of our affection. Now that you've abolished a privilege so painful to lovers... That privilege exists no more, what now? Today we've come to gather the first fruit of your generosity. Our wedding is already arranged. Please crown her, whom this gift of yours has preserved spotless, with this white veil, symbol of virtue. Devilish sly! But I must dissemble. My friends, I thank you for your honest feelings, but for this I do not deserve any praise. It was an unjust privilege, and by abolishing it in my domain I have restored to nature and duty their rights. - Hurrah! - Hurrah! Hurrah! - What nobility! - What justice! I promise to perform the ceremony. But give me leave awhile. I wish to complete your happiness before my friends and in style. Marcellina must be found. Leave me, friends. Blithe maids, scatter flowers before our noble lord. His generous heart has preserved intact for you the chaste purity of a still fairer flower. Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah! And you're not cheering? He's unhappy because my lord has dismissed him from the palace. On this happiest of days! On a wedding day! When everyone applauds you! Forgive me, my lord. You don't deserve it. He's still a child. Less so than you think. I did wrong, I know; But I'll never mention... Enough; I pardon you. Nay, I'll do more: There is a vacancy for an officer in my regiment. I nominate you; Go at once, goodbye. - Just until tomorrow... - No, he must go at once. I'm ready, my lord, and will obey you. Embrace Susanna for the last time. That surprised them. Captain, give me your hand. Before you go I want a word with you. Goodbye, master Cherubino! How your fate changes in a moment! No more, you amorous butterfly, will you go fluttering round, disturbing the peace of maids, you Narcissus, you Adonis of love. No more will you have those fine feathers, that light and dashing cap, those curls, those airs and graces, that roseate womanish colour. You'll be among warriors, by Bacchus! Long moustaches, knapsack tightly on, musket on your shoulder, sabre at your side, head erect, bold expression, a great helmet, a head-dress, lots of honour, little money, and instead of the fandango, marching through the mud. Over mountains, through valleys, in snow and days of heat, to the sound of blunderbusses, shells and cannons, whose shots make your ears sing on every note. Cherubino, on to victory, on to military glory! Bring, o love, some relief to my sorrow, to my sighs. Give me back my loved one or in mercy let me die. Come in, dear Susanna, tell me the rest of the story. There's no more to tell. So he tried to make love to you? His lordship doesn't pay such compliments to girls like me: He came to offer me money. Cruel man, he loves me no longer! Yet how can he be jealous of you? That is the way of modern husbands: On principle unfaithful, by nature fickle, and by pride all jealous. But if Figaro loves you, only he could... Here he is! Come in, friend. My lady's getting anxious. You've no call to be worried about that. After all, what's it all about? My bride attracts his lordship, and so he'd like secretly to revive his feudal right. It's all possible and natural. - Possible! - Natural! Very natural! And if Susanna consents, very possible. - Have done with you! - I've done. That's why he decided to choose me as courier, and Susanna as confidential attach√©e to the embassy. Because she refuses the post of honour he planned for her, he threatens to favour Marcellina. That's the whole story. And you treat lightly so serious a matter? Aren't you glad I treat it at all? Here's my plan. By Basilio I've sent a letter warning his lordship of an assignation you've made with a lover during the ball. Heavens! What do I hear? To so jealous a man! All the better: The more easily we can harass him, confuse him, embroil him, foil his designs, fill him with suspicions, and make him realise that this new game he's playing on me can be played on him; So he'll waste time in fruitless search. Then, all of a sudden, without him having made any plan to prevent it, our wedding will be upon us, and in your presence he'd not dare to oppose it. True, but in his stead Marcellina will oppose it. Wait. Let the Count know that in the evening you'll wait in the garden. We'll get young Cherubino, whom I advised not to leave yet, to go there in your place, dressed as a woman. If monsieur is caught by milady, this is the only way by which he can be made to grant her wishes. - What do you think? - Not bad. In our situation... If he's determined... Have we time enough? The Count has gone out hunting, and won't be back for some hours. I'll send Cherubino to you at once. I leave to you the task of disguising him. And then? And then... If, my dear Count, you feel like dancing, it's I who'll call the tune. I'm grieved, Susanna, that the youth overheard the Count's follies. You just don't know... But why ever did he not come straight to me? Where's his song? Come in, my gallant captain. Don't call me by that horrid title! It reminds me that I am forced to leave a godmother so kind... And so beautiful! Ah, yes, indeed. Ah, yes, indeed. Hypocrite! Sing to my lady the song you gave me this morning. Who wrote it? Look: He's blushing all over his face. Take my guitar and accompany him. I'm all a-tremble, but if my lady wishes... Yes, indeed she does: Don't keep her waiting. You ladies who know what love is, see if it is what I have in my heart. All that I feel I will explain; Since it is new to me, I don't understand it. I have a feeling full of desire, which now is pleasure, now is torment. I freeze, then I feel my spirit all ablaze, and the next moment I turn again to ice. I seek for a treasure outside myself, I know not who holds it nor what it is. I sigh and I groan without wishing to, I flutter and tremble without knowing why, I find no peace by night or day, but yet to languish thus is sheer delight. You ladies who know what love is, see if it is what I have in my heart. Bravo! A charming voice! I didn't know you sang so well. Oh, I must say everything he does, he does well. Come along, handsome soldier. - Figaro will have told you... - He's told me everything. Let me see. This will do splendidly: We're the same height. Off with your coat. - What are you doing? - Don't worry. - But if someone comes in? - Let him, what harm are we doing? I'll lock the door. But how am I to dress his hair? Take one of my caps from my dressing-room. Quickly! What is this paper? - My commission. - They're in a hurry! I've just had it from Basilio. In their haste they've forgotten the seal. - What seal? - Of his commission. What, so soon! Here's the cap. Hurry! That's right. Woe betide us if the Count should come. Come, kneel down. Stay still here. Keep quiet, now turn round. Bravo! That's very good. Now turn and face me. Here! Your eyes towards me. Look straight at me. My lady isn't here. That collar a bit higher. Those eyes cast down. Your hands folded before you. Then let's see how you walk when you're on your feet. Look at the little rascal! Isn't he handsome? What roguish glances! What airs, what graces! If women fall in love with him, they have good reason why. This is too silly! I'm almost jealous myself. You little scamp, you've no right to look so pretty! Oh heaven! Would that I could die now! Perhaps near the final moment these lips would dare... Be sensible: What is this nonsense? Who's knocking at the door? Why is this locked? My husband! Oh heavens, I'm lost! You here without a coat on, in this state, he'll have had the letter, and he's so jealous! - What's delaying you? - I'm alone, yes, all alone. - To whom were you talking? - To you, of course. After what's happened, he'll be furious. I don't know what to do! Heaven protect me in this danger! What does this mean? You never used to lock yourself in your room! I know, but I... I was trying... - Go on, trying... - Some clothes on... Susanna was with me, but now she's gone to her room. In any case, you seem perturbed. Look at this letter. Heavens! It's the letter Figaro wrote! What is that noise? Something fell in your dressing-room. I heard nothing. You must be deep in thought. About what? - There's someone there. - Who do you think it could be? I'm asking you, I've only just come in. Ah yes, Susanna, of course. But you told me she went to her room. To hers or mine, I didn't notice. Susanna! Then why are you so agitated? About my maid? I don't know, but certainly you're agitated. Rather than agitating me, my maid is agitating you. That's true indeed, as you'll see. Susanna, come out of there! Come out, I command you! - Stop, listen! - What's this row about? - She can't come out. - Where has the page got to? And who dares forbid it? Who? Decency forbids it. She's in there trying on her wedding dress. It's all too plain: There's a lover in there. It's all too horrible: Whatever will happen? I think I understand: Let's see how things work out. - Susanna! - Stop! - Come out of there! - Listen! - Come out! - Stop! I command you! She can't come out. Well, at least speak, Susanna, if you're there. No, you're not to, I order you, be silent. Pray be careful, Countess! There's bound to be a catastrophe, an open scandal. - Pray be careful, Count! - Pray be careful, Countess! We must try to avoid a catastrophe, an open scandal. Then you won't open it? Why should I open my own room? Very well then, as you please. We'll open it without the key. Ho there! What? Would you hazard a lady's reputation? That's true, I was in error. Without any outcry or scandal before the servants, I can go myself and bring the tools. Kindly remain here. But... So that my suspicions shall be completely quieted, first I'll lock the other doors. What folly! You will have the goodness to come with me. Let me offer you my arm. Let's go. Let's go. Susanna will have to stay there till we return. Open quickly, it's Susanna. Come out of there. You must get away at once. What a terrible scene! What a dreadful thing to happen! - Leave without delay! - What a terrible scene! - This way, no, that way! - What a dreadful thing to happen! The doors are locked. Whatever shall we do? We can't give up. He'll kill you if he finds you. He'll kill me if he finds me. He'll kill you if he finds you. Let me look outside. - It faces the garden. - Stop, Cherubino! Stop, for pity's sake! A flowerpot or two... Nothing worse will happen. It's too high to jump. Stop, for pity's sake! - We can't give up. - Stop, Cherubino! He'll kill me if he finds me. - It's too high to jump. - Let me go! - Stop, for pity's sake! - Let me go! Rather than harm her, I'd leap into the fire. I embrace her through you. Farewell, so be it. He'll kill himself! Stop, for pity's sake! Just look at the little demon! How he runs! He's a mile away already. There's no time to lose, though. I'll go into the dressing-room. Let the blusterer come, I'm ready for him. All is as I left it. Will you open it yourself, - or must... - Alas, stay and hear me for a moment. Do you think me capable of failing in my duty? As you please. I'm going to see who's locked in there. Yes, you'll see... But listen to me calmly. So it's not Susanna? No, but it's someone else whom you could not reasonably allow yourself to suspect: For tonight we were preparing a harmless joke and I swear to you in honour, in honesty... - Who is it? Tell me. I'll kill him. - Listen. Ah, I dare not. Speak out. He's a child. A child! Yes, Cherubino. Am I destined to find that page wherever I go? What? Hasn't he gone? The scoundrels! This explains my doubts, the confusion, the plot of which the letter warned me. Now out you come, you imp of Satan, you villain, without delay. My lord, your anger makes my heart tremble for him. You still dare to cross me? - No, listen. - Go on, speak. I swear to heaven that your suspicions, the state in which you'll find him, his collar untied, his chest bare... His collar untied? His chest bare? Pray continue! So as to dress him up as a woman... I see, you shameless wife, I'll take my revenge for this! Your anger does me wrong, your suspicion is an insult. Give me the key! - He is innocent. - Give me the key! - You know it. - I know nothing. Out of my sight! You are faithless, wanton, you've sought to disgrace me. I'll go, yes... - But... - I'll not hear you. I am guiltless. I can read it in your face. He shall die. To what extreme will his blind fury lead him? He shall die, and I'll be rid of the source of all my torment! Susanna! Susanna! My lord! Why this astonishment? Draw your sword, kill the page. Here you see that imp of Satan. What do I see? My head is spinning. What can have happened? Susanna in there? They're both baffled and can't understand. Are you alone? Look and see who can be hidden there. Yes, let's see who is hidden in there. Susanna, I'm fainting, I can't breathe. Don't worry, take heart, he's already safe. How could I be so wrong! I can hardly believe it. If I did you wrong, I beg your forgiveness. But to play such a jest is sheer cruelty. Your madness deserves no pity. I love you! Don't say that! I swear it! You're lying! I'm a faithless, wanton creature who's always deceiving you. Help me, Susanna, to calm her anger. This is the punishment for your suspicions. So this is the reward I can expect for the loyalty of my faithful heart! Help me, Susanna, to calm her anger. This is the punishment for your suspicions. My lady! Rosina! Cruel man! I am no longer she, but the wretched object of your neglect, whom you delight to make suffer. Confused and repentant, - I'm punished enough. - He's punished enough. My heart cannot bear so great a wrong. Have pity now. But the page locked in there? It was only to test you. And all your trembling? Only to tease you. But this cruel letter? Figaro wrote it, and sent it by Basilio. The traitors! I'll... He who can't forgive others doesn't deserve to be forgiven. Well then, if you will, let's make peace all round. Rosina, don't be so harsh with me. Susanna, how soft-hearted I am! Who would ever believe in a woman's fury? With men, my lady, you turn and turn about, but you see it always ends like this. - Look at me. - Ungrateful! Look at me. I wronged you, and I repent it! From this moment our hearts will learn to know better. My lord and lady, the musicians are outside. You can hear the trumpeters and the pipers. With the singing and dancing of our vassals, let us hasten to celebrate our wedding! One moment, not so fast. The crowd is waiting. One moment, not so fast. Before you go, remove a doubt of mine. This is getting difficult, how will it end? Now I must play my cards carefully. Master Figaro, do you know who penned this letter? I've no idea. - You've no idea? - No. - Didn't you give it to Basilio? - To deliver? - You're deceiving me. - No, no. - You know about the gallant... - This evening in the garden... - You know now... - I've no idea. In vain you seek a defence or an excuse. Your very face accuses you. I can see you're trying to lie. My face is the liar, not. You sharpen your wits in vain. We've revealed the secret, there's no more to be said. - What's your answer? - Nothing. - So you admit it? - No, I don't. Hold your tongue, stupid, this comedy must be ended. Then to end it happily according to theatrical practice, let a marriage ceremony now follow. Oh my lord, do not refuse, - grant my wishes. - Grant their wishes. Marcellina, how slow you are in coming! Ah, my lord! What's the matter? How dare he! Who did it? What are you saying? What happened? - Listen. - Go on, speak. I've seen many things thrown from the balcony over the garden, but just now I saw a man, my lord, thrown down! - From the balcony? - See these carnations? - Into the garden? - Yes! - Figaro, think! - What do I hear? - We're taken aback. What's this drunkard doing in here? So you saw a man: Where did he go? The scoundrel took to his heels and was gone at once. It was the page. I know, I saw him. Be quiet. What's there to laugh at? You're drunk from morn till night. Now tell me again. - A man from the balcony? - From the balcony. - Into the garden? - Into the garden. My lord, it's the wine in him talking! Go on. Did you see his face? No, I didn't. Figaro, listen. You whining old fool, be quiet! Making such a fuss over nothing! Since the fact can't be concealed, it was I who jumped down from there. What? It was you? - What presence of mind! - What? It was you? - Why so surprised? - I can't believe it. How have you grown so tall? I Can't believe it. - After jumping you weren't so big. - Jumping does that. Who'd have thought it? The fool insists! - What do you say? - It looked like the boy to me. Cherubino! Wretched man! Of course, it was he, back on horseback from Seville, from Seville where he'd been. No, that's not so. I didn't see any horse jump down. Give me patience! - Let's have done with this nonsense. - Heaven, how will this end? - So it was you. - I jumped down. - But why? - I was afraid. - Afraid of what? - I was shut up in there waiting for Susanna. There was an unusual noise. You were shouting. There was that letter... I jumped down in terror and wrenched a muscle in my foot! Then these letters which you dropped will be yours? Here, give them to me. I'm caught in a trap. Figaro, think quickly! Well, tell me, what's this paper? Wait just a moment, I've so many. I expect it'll be a list of his debts. No, a list of the tavern-keepers. Speak up. And you, let him be. - Let him be and go away! - Let me be and go away! - I'll go, but if I catch you again... - Let him be! - Go away, I'm not afraid of you. - Let him be! I'll go, but if I catch you again... Let him be and go away! Well? Heavens! The page's commission! - Good Lord! The commission! - Take courage! Oh, what a head! It's the commission the boy gave me a while ago. What for? It lacked... It lacked? The seal! Answer! It's usual... Go on, why hesitate? It's usual to seal it. This rascal's driving me mad. In vain you fume and stamp, sir, you'll get nothing out of me. If I survive this storm. - I'll fear no further shipwreck. - The whole thing's a mystery to me. My just and noble lord, hear us now, we pray. - They've come to work my vengeance. - They've come to foil me. - I feel consoled. - What solution can there be? They're three stupid blockheads. What are they doing here? Now quiet, without interruption let each say what he wishes. This man has made a contract to marry me, and I insist that he honour it. What's this? I will have silence! This is for me to judge. I represent this lady and appear here as her counsel. I come to argue her legitimate plea. He's a rogue! I will have silence! This is for me to judge. As a man of standing, I come here to testify that she lent him money on a promise of marriage. They're all mad. Silence, I say! Let's see it let us read the contract. Everything must be done in proper order. I'm stunned and bewildered! What a blow, what a stroke! I'm stupefied and desperate! Everyone is baffled. The devil in hell for certain has brought them here. Providence, that smiles on us, - has brought us here. - Has brought them here. What a mix-up this is! An anonymous letter... The maid locked in the dressing-room... My lady flustered... A man jumping from the balcony into the garden... Then another who claims it was he... I don't know what to think. It might have been one of my vassals. Such rabble are bold enough. But the Countess... To doubt her is an insult. She has too much respect for herself and for my honour... Honour... What has human frailty done with it? Take courage; Tell him to meet you in the garden. I'll find out if Cherubino went to Seville: I've sent Basilio to enquire. Heavens! And Figaro? Say nothing to him, I will go in your place. Before this evening he should be back. Oh Lord! I dare not. Reflect that my happiness is in your hands. And Susanna? Who knows if she has betrayed my secret? If she has spoken, I'll make him marry the old woman. (Marcellina!) My lord... What do you want? I believe you're angry! What have you come for? My lord... My lady is feeling faint and requests your smelling salts. Take them. I'll bring them back at once. No, you may keep them for yourself. For me? Such ailments are not for girls in my position. A girl who loses her bridegroom on the point of winning him... Paying Marcellina with the dowry you promised me... That I promised you? When? That's what I understood. Yes, if you had cared to come to an understanding. It's my duty, and my lord's wish is my command. Cruel one, why have you left me to languish? My lord, a woman always needs time before she says "yes". Then you'll come to the garden? If it pleases you, I'll come. You won't fail me? No, I won't fail you. - You'll come? - Yes. - You'll not fail? - No. - You'll not fail? - I'll not fail. No, I'll not fail you. In contentment I feel my heart full of joy. Forgive my deception, you who truly love. Then you'll come to the garden? If it pleases you, I'll come. You won't fail me? No, I won't fail you. - You'll come? - Yes. - You'll not fail? - No. - You'll really come? - No! - No? - Yes! If it pleases you, I'll come. - You'll not fail? - No. - You'll really come? - Yes. You'll not fail? Yes! - Yes? - No! No, I'll not fail you. Then why were you so distant to me this morning? With the page there... And to Basilio, who spoke on my behalf? But what need have we of a Basilio? That's true, indeed. Promise me again, if you fail me, my dear... But the Countess will be waiting for the smelling salts. That was just a pretext: I couldn't have spoken to you without one. - Dearest! - Someone's coming. - She's mine, I'm sure now. - Wipe off that smile, cunning master. Susanna, where are you going? Hush. You've won your case without a lawyer. What's happened? You've won your case! What do I hear! I've fallen into a trap! The traitors! I'll punish them so! The sentence will be at my pleasure. But supposing he has paid off the claims of the old woman? Paid her? How? And then there's Antonio who'll refuse to give his niece to a Figaro of unknown parentage. If I play on the pride of that half-wit... Everything favours my plan. The die is cast. Must I see a serf of mine made happy while I am left to sigh? And him possess a treasure which I desire in vain? Am I to see a base servant united in love to the woman I desire, who roused in me a passion she does not feel for me? Ah no, I will not give you the satisfaction of this contentment! You were not born, bold fellow, to cause me torment and indeed to laugh at my discomfiture. Now only the hope of taking vengeance eases my mind and makes me rejoice. The case is decided. Pay up, or marry her. That's all. - I breathe again. - And I'm done for. At last I'll be married to the man I love. My lord, I appeal... The judgement is fair: Pay up, or marry her. Well done, Don Curzio. Your lordship is too kind. An excellent judgement! In what way excellent? We are all avenged. I won't marry her. You will. Pay up, or marry her. She lent you two thousand pieces of silver. I am of gentle birth, and without the consent of my noble parents... Where are they? Who are they? Let me go on looking: In ten years I hope to find them. Were you a foundling? No, lost, doctor, or rather stolen. - Stolen? - What's that? - Your proof? - Your witness? The gold, jewels, and embroidered clothes which, in my infancy, the bandits found upon me are the true indications of my noble birth, and moreover this mark upon my arm. A spatula on your right arm? Who told you that? Great heaven! It's he. It's I, indeed. Who? Raffaello. And robbers stole you? Near a castle. There stands your mother. - My nurse? - No, your mother. His mother! Do I hear aright? And there stands your father. Dearest son, in this embrace recognise your mother. Father dear, do the same, do not leave me longer here to blush. Do not let conscience stand in the way of your desire. - He's his father, she's his mother. - I'm astounded, I'm amazed. The wedding can't go forward. Beloved son! - Beloved son! - Beloved parents! It would be best to leave. Just a moment, my lord. I have the money ready here. I've come to pay for Figaro and set him free. - Beloved son! - Beloved parents! We don't know where we are. Just look over there. Already reconciled to her as wife? Great heaven, how faithless! Leave me, wretch! Stay a moment. Listen, my dearest. Listen to that! - It's the result of her full heart. - I rage, I burn with fury, fate has overcome me. I rage, I burn with fury, this old woman has triumphed. He rages, he burns with fury, fate has overcome him. This old woman has triumphed. Dearest daughter, calm your bitterness. Embrace his mother who now will be yours too. - His mother? - His mother. Your mother? And this is my father, who'll tell you it's true. - His father? - His father. Your father? And this is my mother, who'll tell you it's true. My heart scarcely can support the raging torment of this moment. My heart scarcely can support the bliss of this moment. And there, my dear, is the sweet fruit of our old love. Let's not talk now of so remote a past: He's my son, you are my consort, and we'll get married when you wish. Today; It can be a double wedding. Take this contract for the sum you owe me, it is your wedding present. Take this purse too. And this as well. Thank you, I'll take all I'm given. Let's go and tell my lady and my uncle all that's happened. Who could be as happy as I am? I Am. - I am. - I am. And I don't care how this infuriates the Count. Come, dear page, in our house you'll find the prettiest girls of the estate, and you shall be the prettiest of them all. But woe betide me if the Count should find me. You know he thinks I've left for Seville. Oh well, if he does find you it won't be anything new. Listen! We're going to dress you like one of us. Then we'll all go to present flowers to my lady. Cherubino, have faith in Barbarina. Susanna's not come! I'm impatient to know what the Count said to her proposal. The plan seems to me somewhat rash, and with a husband so impetuous and jealous! But where's the harm? To change my clothes with those of Susanna, and hers with mine, under cover of darkness... Oh heavens! To what humiliation am I reduced by a cruel husband! In a strange mixture of infidelity, jealousy and disdain, he first loved me, then neglected me, and finally deceived me. He now forces me to seek help from my servant! Where are those happy moments of sweetness and pleasure? Where have they gone, those vows of a deceiving tongue? Then why, if everything for me is changed to tears and grief, has the memory of that happiness not faded from my breast? Ah! If only my constancy in yearning for him lovingly could bring hope of changing his ungrateful heart! I tell you, sir, that Cherubino is still in the castle. Look, here's his cap to prove it. But how? By this time he ought to be in Seville. If I may say so, all Seville's in my house. There he's been dressed as a girl and left his own clothes. The traitors! Let's go, and you can see for yourself. What things you're telling me! What did the Count say then? You could read his anger in his face. Gently now: It will be the easier to catch him. Where is the rendezvous that you suggested? In the garden. Let's fix a place for it. Write to him. I write? But my lady... Write, I tell you, and I'll take it all upon myself. A song to the zephyr. To the zephyr. "How sweet the breeze..." The breeze. "...will be this evening..." Will be this evening. "...In the pine grove". In the pine grove? In the pine grove. The rest he'll understand. I'm sure he'll understand. The letter's folded. How shall I seal it? Here. Take this pin, it will serve as a seal. Wait. Write on the back of the letter: "Send back the seal". It's stranger than the seal on the commission. Quick, hide it: I hear people coming. Accept, noble lady, these roses and these flowers. We have picked them this morning to show you our affection. We are only humble peasant girls and we are poor, but the little that we can give we offer with all our hearts. These, my lady, are the girls of the district. They offer what little they have and beg pardon for being so bold. How kind: I thank you. Aren't they pretty! And tell me, who is that charming girl who looks so shy? That's one of my cousins, who's come yesterday evening for the wedding. We should honour this fair stranger. Come here. Let me have your flower. How she blushes! Susanna, don't you think she resembles someone? To the life! There you are! There's your officer. - Oh heavens! - The scamp! Well, madam... My lord, I am as annoyed and surprised as you are. But this morning? This morning... We wanted to dress him up for the party. - Why have you not left? - My lord... I shall know how to punish his disobedience. Your lordship, you've told me so often when you've caressed and kissed me: "Barbarina, if you love me I'll give you whatever you want". I said that? You did. So please give me, sir, Cherubino for a husband, and I'll love you as I love my kitten. Well, now it's your turn. Well done, my girl! You've learned your lesson well. What man, demon or god turns everything against me? My lord, if you keep these girls here, there'll be no party, no dancing. Indeed! You want to dance with an injured foot? Oh, it doesn't hurt any more. Come, pretty ones. Lucky the flowerpots were only earthenware. That's right. Now come along. Meanwhile the page was galloping off to Seville? Galloping or trotting, off he went. Come along, my dears. And his commission was left in your pocket. Indeed. What questions! Stop making signs to him, he doesn't understand. Here's someone who says my nephew-to-be is a liar. - Cherubino! - There you are. What's his story? No story, but he says he jumped on the carnations this morning. He says so! Well, if I jumped, it is possible that he too could have done the same. - He too? - Why not? I never dispute what I don't know. There's the march, let's go. Take your places, ladies. Susanna, give me your arm. Here it is. Such presumption! I feel like ice. - My lady... - Say no more now. Here are two couples: We must receive them. One especially has your protection. Let's sit. Let's sit. And plan my revenge. Faithful and honourable girls, sing praises to our wise lord. By renouncing a right which outraged and offended, he leaves you pure for your lovers. Let us sing praises to our wise lord. Just like a woman, to stick pins everywhere. Ha, ha! I see her meaning. Some flirt, in passing, has slipped him a love letter sealed with a pin. It has pricked his finger. Our Narcissus is looking for her; What fun! Now go, friends, and let the wedding celebration be arranged for this evening with the richest ceremony. I wish there to be a splendid entertainment, with singing and fireworks, a grand banquet and a grand ball. You shall see how I treat those dear to me. Faithful and honourable girls, sing praises to our wise lord. By renouncing a right which outraged and offended, he leaves you pure for your lovers. Let us sing praises to our wise lord. Oh dear me, I've lost it! Wherever can it be? I can't find it. My cousin... And my lord, what will he say? What's the matter, Barbarina? I've lost it, cousin. - What? - What? The pin his lordship gave me to take back to Susanna. To Susanna? The pin? So young and already so dutiful? Why are you angry with me? Can't you see I'm joking? Look. This is the pin the Count gave you to take back to Susanna. It was used to seal a note. You see I know all about it. Then why ask me if you know it all? I wanted to hear how his lordship sent you on this errand. Nothing remarkable! "Here, my girl, take this pin to pretty Susanna,‚Äù "and say: This is the seal of the pine grove". Aha! The pine grove! And then he added: "Take care no one sees you!" But you won't tell. Trust me. It can't concern you. Not at all. Goodbye, cousin: I'm going to Susanna and then to Cherubino. - Mother., - My son. All is over. Calm yourself, my son. All is over, I say. Patience, patience and yet more patience. Things are serious and we must think them out. But wait, you don't know whom the joke is on. Oh mother, that pin was the one he picked up a little while ago. True. But this only justifies your being on your guard and keeping your eyes open. But you don't know if in fact... I'll be on the alert! I know where the meeting has been arranged for. Where are you going, my son? To avenge all husbands. Farewell. Quickly, I must warn Susanna. I believe her innocent. That face, that air of modesty... And yet even were she not... Ah, when her own heart is not personally involved, every woman is drawn to the defence of her poor sex, so unjustly oppressed by these ungrateful men. The billy-goat and she-goat always live on friendly terms, the ram never wages war on the ewe. The fiercest beasts of the forest and the field leave their mates in peace and freedom. But we, poor women, who so love these men, are treated by the traitors with constant perfidy. Who goes there? Those whom you invited to come. What a scowl! Do not go away from hereabouts. I must go and give some instructions; I'll be back very shortly. When I whistle, all of you rush out. He has the devil in him. But what's amiss? Nothing. Susanna pleases the Count. She agreed to meet him, and that doesn't please Figaro. So what? Should he bear that calmly? Couldn't he bear what so many have to bear? And then, listen: What would he gain by it? In this world it is always dangerous to clash with important people. They can give away ninety per cent and still win. In those years when reason, little practised, counts for little, I too felt the same fire, I was foolish, as I am not now. With time and tribulations Dame Caution appeared, and drove whims and punctilios from my head. Near a little hut she led me one day with her, and taking down from the wall of that peaceful dwelling an ass's skin, said: "Take this, my dear son!" Then she disappeared and left me. While I was still gazing in mute surprise at her gift, the sky grew cloudy, the thunder roared, rain mixed with hail came pelting down, and lo, to cover myself I made use of the ass's skin she had given me. The gale ceased, and I had taken but two steps when a ferocious beast appeared before me; Already its ravening maw was upon me; I had no hope of defending myself. But the vile stench of my garb so took away the beast's appetite that, scorning me in disgust, it returned to the woods. Thus fate made me realise that shame, dangers, humiliation and death can be avoided beneath an ass's skin. Everything is ready: The hour must be at hand. I heard someone. It is she. No, no one. It's very dark tonight... And now I begin to learn the foolish art of being a husband. Traitress! At the very moment of our wedding, he was reading with pleasure, and I, watching him, was unwittingly laughing at myself. Oh Susanna, Susanna, what anguish you have cost me! With that sweet face... With those innocent eyes... Who would have believed it! Ah, to trust women is sheer folly. Just open your eyes, you rash and foolish men, look at these women, see them as they are. These goddesses, so called by intoxicated senses, are offered tribute by enfeebled reason. They are witches who cast spells for our torment, sirens who sing for our confusion, night owls who fascinate in order to pluck us, comets who dazzle to deprive us of light. They are thorned roses, alluring vixens, smiling she-bears, malign doves, masters of deceit, friends of distress, who cheat and lie, feel no love and have no pity. No, no! The rest I need not say, for everyone knows it already. Madam, you are trembling: Are you cold? The night is rather chilly. I'll go in. Now comes the climax of the drama. If your ladyship will allow me, I'll stay among these trees to take the air for half an hour. To take the air! Stay, and take your time. The rascal's watching, so we'll have some fun. We'll reward him for his doubts. At last comes the moment when, without reserve, I can rejoice in my lover's arms. Timid scruples, hence from my heart, and do not come to trouble my delight. Oh, how the spirit of this place, the earth and the sky, seem to echo the fire of love! How the night furthers my stealth! Come, do not delay, o bliss, come where love calls thee to joy, while night's torch does not shine in the sky, while the air is still dark and the world quiet. Here murmurs the stream, here sports the breeze, which refreshes the heart with its sweet whispers. Here flowers smile and the grass is cool. Here everything invites to the pleasures of love. Come, my dearest, amid these sheltered trees. Come, come! I will wreathe thy brow with roses. The traitress! This is how she was deceiving me. Am I awake or dreaming? The page! I hear someone: I'll go where I can find Barbarina. Oh, I see a woman! Woe is me! Surely not! By that apron I thought I recognised Susanna in the darkness. If my lord should come now! Cruel fate! I'll approach her very softly, my time will not be wasted. If the Count should arrive now what confusion there will be! Dear Susanna! She doesn't answer. She hides her face with her hand. Now I'll really tease her. Impudent fellow, be off from here at once! Affected flirt, I know why you're here. There is my Susanna. Here's the bird-catcher. Don't be so hard on me! How my heart beats! - Go away, or I'll call for help. - Another man is with her. Give me a kiss, or you'll do nothing. - It's the page's voice. - A kiss? What insolence! And why can't I do. - What effrontery! - What the Count is about to do? - What effrontery! - Don't be so prudish! What effrontery! You know I was behind the sofa. If the wretch persists in being obstinate, he will ruin our plan. Take a kiss then. Heavens! The Count. I must see what's going on there. Since you won't behave, take this. That's the reward my curiosity has brought me. That's the reward his temerity has brought him. That's the reward his curiosity has brought him. At last that impudent fellow's gone. Come nearer, my dear. As you wish. Here I am, my lord. What an obliging girl! What an open-hearted bride! Give me your little hand. Here it is. My dearest! His dearest? What slender fingers! What delicate skin! They pierce me through and through and fill me with new ardour. His blind infatuation... What slender fingers! ...deludes his reason... What delicate skin! ...and deceives all his senses. Besides your dowry, my dearest, take this jewel too, which a lover gives you as token of his love. Susanna accepts everything from her benefactor. Everything is going splendidly! But the best is yet to come. My lord, I see the glow of torches. Come then, my Venus, let us conceal ourselves. Foolish husbands, come and learn your lesson. - In the dark, my lord? - That's what I want. You know I'm not going there in order to read. - Now she's followed him. - The rogues are in the trap. I can't doubt her deceit. The play has begun well. Who's there? Just people. That's Figaro! I'm going. Go on! I'll come back soon. All is quiet and peaceful. Fair Venus has gone in. To take her with her lover Mars, like a modern Vulcan I'll catch her in my net. Hey, Figaro! Keep quiet! That is the Countess. You came in time. There you'll see for yourself the Count and my bride. You can touch them with your own hand. Speak a little softer. I shall not stir from here, but I will be avenged. Susanna! Be avenged? Yes. How can you do this? - I'll trap the villain, - The vixen wants to trap me, - then I'll know what to do. - I'll lead her on. Ah, if my lady wishes it! Go on, don't waste words. Here I kneel at your feet. My heart is full of fire. Look at this spot. Think how you were betrayed. How my hand itches! How my bosom heaves! I'm impatient, I'm furious! I'm impatient, I'm on fire! Without any love? Let my indignation be sufficient. Let's waste no more time in vain. Give me your hand. - Give me... - Take it, sir! What a blow! And that, and that as well. - And that, and that too. - Don't beat me so fast. And that, you rascal, and that again. - How sweet these blows! - That'll teach you, false one, - How happy is my love! - To play the seducer. Now peace, my dearest treasure, I recognised the voice I love and which keeps my heart in thrall. - My voice? - The voice I adore. Then peace, my dearest treasure, peace, my sweetest love. I can't find her anywhere. That's the Count, I recognise his voice. Hey, Susanna! Are you deaf? Are you dumb? Oh lovely! He didn't recognise her! - Who? - My lady. - My lady? - My lady. Let's end this comedy, my dearest, and console this strange lover. Yes, my lady, - you are my love. - My wife! And I unarmed! Grant some solace to my heart. Here I am, I'll do what you will. How dare they! Let us hasten, love, and let pleasure make up for our pain. Ho there! To arms! To arms! The master! Ho there, I say! Help! I'm lost! What's amiss? The scoundrel has betrayed me, shamed me, and you shall see with whom. - I'm astounded, I'm bewildered. - They're astounded, they're bewildered. - I can't believe it's true! - Oh, what a scene, what joy! In vain you resist, come forth, my lady! Receive the reward of your virtue. The page! My daughter! My mother! My lady! The plot is discovered, the traitress is here. Forgive me, forgive me! No, do not hope for it! Forgive me, forgive me! No, no, I will not! - Forgive us! - No! No, no! At least let me plead forgiveness for them. Oh heavens! What do I see? A delusion! A vision! I Can't believe it. My Countess, forgive me! I am kinder: I will say "yes". Then let us all be happy. This day of torment, of caprices and folly, love alone can end in contentment and joy. Lovers and friends, to the dancing! Let's set off the fireworks! And to the sound of a joyful march let's all hurry off to celebrate.
