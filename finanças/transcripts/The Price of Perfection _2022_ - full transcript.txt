911. What's your emergency? A-a car... A-a c-car is chasing me. Leslie James. James Celebration. Uh, actually, Brad passed away last year. Yes, yes, it was very unexpected. Thank you so much. But, uh, we're still taking on new clients, and I would be happy to help you with whatever you needed. Fantastic, yes, I will send you some brochures for you to look at and then we can go from there. Okay. Okay, great. Thank you. Thank you so much. Oh. Good morning. You were up early. Oh, thanks for this, but I gotta go. Ryan, your ride is leaving! Let me pack it up, okay? You can't run five miles and skip breakfast. Ma, I had a protein bar. I, uh, found your Cornell brochure in the recycling. It's too expensive. Ava, you've been talking about going there since you were five. I know, I just feel like there are a lot of other schools I can get scholarships to easier. I'm just being realistic. Listen, sweetheart... Please, be a kid for a little bit longer and let me worry about the finances, okay? Ryan! Seriously? Chill, woman. Let's go. - Oh! Beautiful. - Hey, no, not off the... - Well, it's delicious. - Yeah, okay. - I love you, too. - Thank you for all this. - Okay, wow, thanks. I love you. - Love you, too. Hey, Ava. He's, uh... He's doing okay, right? Yeah, he is, actually. We're weirdly getting along. Ah, music to my ears. Oh, uh, tiny favor. Are you guys okay to handle dinner alone tonight again? I've got this really needy client. - Yeah. Don't worry about it. - Okay. I love you. Hi, Monica, yes, tell her that I will be there at 6 p.m. for the site tour. - Well, thanks for the ride. - Hey, Ry... Look, today is kind of a big day. Um, I'm really stressed out about my physics test. - Um, I was just wondering... - Yeah? I-I could use a little help. Um, here. Oh, I don't need the whole thing. Take it, I don't like how they make me feel anyways. I'd rather just have good old ADHD. Oh, I thought they were helping. Well, you more than me. Plus, they mess up my songwriting, so... Just don't overdo it. Okay, weirdo? All right. Uh... Thank you. Yes! Way to go, Ava! Let's keep working on narrowing those lead times before the next meet, Ava's gonna take us home in the relays, she's proven the most consistent top time. Um, what? She just joined the team. We've all been training for over a year. Well, not hard enough, obviously. Maybe she should just run the whole relay herself. Coach Nassar keeps whining about you quitting the swim team, Ava. - But his loss is our gain. - Thanks, coach. I think I can still shave a few seconds off the 400. That's the spirit, you get that time down and you're gonna be looking at some solid scholarship offers. I will. Uh, uh, mom, have you heard back from the UW scout? Your assistant? When you said you were available for our event, I took that to mean the whole weekend. Yeah, I'm sorry, Mrs. Price, but I have something important with my kids. But Monica will be fully briefed ahead of time, and I'll only be a phone call away. You and Brad were always so hands-on. We were expecting the same level of service. I understand if you're struggling on your own. Perhaps I should look at outside help. Uh, you know what, Mrs. Price, I will, uh, I'll move some things around for you. Thank you, Leslie. Absolutely. My pleasure. Good work today, Casey. You're gonna ace that bio exam. Unlikely. My brain just refuses to process this stuff. But if I manage to get a C, I'll have the world's greatest tutor to thank. Yo, this is gonna get mad views. Cool story, bro. Westley is like this beautiful, delicate flower. What he possibly sees in Madison, I have no idea. Well, she has a certain charm. Or at least she did when we were friends. We were junior-high besties. - Until... - She got hot? - No, there was an incident. - Spill the tea! - I can't. I have to go study. - Please. You've battered my weary mind with your science talk. I need a palate cleanse. Okay, fine. The short version. So it was her 13th birthday slumber party, we raided her parents' liquor cabinet and started making prank calls. Of course, the usual. Madison was so desperate to impress the cool girls, but she went way too far. She called our seventh-grade music teacher and pretended to be her daughter. Wait, Ms. Baird? Didn't her daughter commit, like, suicide? Yeah. It was super messed up. And the worst part is Mrs. Baird was able to trace the call back to Madison's house, but Madison tells her mom that it was me, and then gets all the other girls there to back her up. That's diabolical. And yet somehow exactly what I expected. Yeah, I almost got expelled. It was insane. Luckily, my parents believed me. You know, I always knew she was evil, but that's a whole new level. Cramming for the physics test? Um, I gotta get to class. Oh, real quick, babe. I just wanted to ask you about how you help people study and stuff. - Tutoring? - Yeah. I'm literally bombing Lit. And you're, like, the smartest girl in the school. If I flunk, I'm off the track team. Okay. Um, I'll see you later, then. Okay. So why'd you quit the swim team, anyway? I don't know. I needed a change. But weren't you, like, really good? Like, free-ride-to-any-school- you-wanted good? Yeah, after my dad, I just couldn't... That must have been traumatic, having to pull him out of the lake. I know we haven't talked in, like, forever, but I just want to say I'm really sorry about your dad. Thanks. I don't know how you do it. If it were me, I'd barely be functioning. Well, I am barely functioning if you ask my mom. I'm sure she doesn't think that. I mean, I'm okay at track, but I'm definitely not good enough for colleges to ignore my grades. And the one thing that I'm actually decent at is dance, which she thinks is ridiculous, so... I don't wanna study anymore. You're like a machine. Don't you ever just wanna, I don't know, let go? Of course. Look, I-I get it. All of the pressure and-and expectations... - It's exhausting. - Right. Sometimes you just need a little... pick-me-up. Oh, uh, you mean earlier? Uh, those were just, um, supplements. Come on, chica. It's really not a big deal. Everyone's done an upper or two. So... Do you have any more of those? It'll help us study. I won't tell if you don't. Please. Okay. Who would have thought perfect little Ava James stealing her brother's meds? I didn't steal them. Relax. I'm joking, obvi. Perfect. Cheers. You're out late, babe. Looking for some fun? - Mom! - Oh! Ava, what are you doing? I just left my phone in the car. Why are you doing up? You okay? Yeah, just, just some work stuff. It's all good. I'm actually gonna head up to bed, and you should too, missy. - Okay. Goodnight. - Okay. Goodnight. - Hey. Ava, right? - Hey. Yeah. Um, how'd you get my number? I have my sources. I'm just kidding. I asked Madison. I'm sorry it's so late, I couldn't sleep. That's cool. Uh, me neither. I was wondering, what are you doing after school tomorrow? Uh, nothing I can think of. You should come hang out with us. Uh, yeah. Uh, maybe. Sweet. I'll see you tomorrow, then. Maybe. Oh, and by the way, I heard you could get your hands on some pretty fun stuff. Uh, I'm, uh, not so sure about that. If you can. No pressure. Either way, I hope I see you. Cool. I'll think about it. Happy?

Um, it was fine, yeah. Good. Did you get that history assignment in? - It was due today, right? - I know. I blew that off for band practice. - What? - I'm kidding. Right. So, guys, I'm really sorry, but I'm gonna have to be away next weekend. - For the Price event. - Uh, no. We're supposed to scatter dad's ashes at Hart Lake. I know, I promised. And I'm really sorry. It's just that Mrs. Price is a very important client, and she insisted that I be there. Oh, yeah, so you're blowing off dad for some stupid event. Ryan, it's her job. But I-I promise you, okay, the weekend after next. Uh... Screw it, okay? If neither of you wanna come to dad's anniversary, I'll go by myself, fine. How could you say that to us? To mom? Ryan, have you been taking your medication? This is where you're going with this? I'm not allowed to show any emotion? You just want me shut up and get out of the way. Right? All right. Okay. No. Ryan, that... Mom, I'll go talk to him, okay? Hey, Ry. - You okay? - Would you stop asking me that? I think you should tell mom you're off your meds. Right. And tell her that you're taking them instead? You wouldn't. Well, it seems like we both have things we're hiding from her. I just don't want her to worry, you know? A few uppers isn't a big deal, ton of people do it. Right. Okay. Good. Good talk. D-do you, do you know of anyone else who might have some... And I gave you a full bottle, like, a couple of days ago. I know. Things are just really intense right now with exams and all. I mean, I-I don't know, don't you tutor a bunch of kids with learning troubles? I mean, why not try messaging one of them, right? Ryan. Wait. Ava? What are you doing? Oh, I was just looking for, um... I lent Ryan my charger. But this desk is like a black hole, so... Did you two have a good talk? Yeah. Totally. Don't worry about it, mom. Okay. Come on, Case. I know you can do this. Okay. Let's just go through each equation step by step. I'm sorry. I, I had a late night. I pick up a job at Chicken Barrel to help my mom out. What if I told you I know an easy way you can make some money? I'd tell you I'm not into weird Internet stuff? What? No. I know some people who would pay for, well, Dex pills, if that's an option for you. You mean, like, like, deal? I-I don't know. It's 20 bucks a pill. It's for Casey. You guys are friends, right? Uh, I guess so, yeah. I'm glad we can help her. She's a total welfare case. I, I got the stuff. Can you say that a little louder? Here you go, I guess? - Go. - Oh. Okay. Pleasure doing business with you. Likewise. Yes, I received a notice about my husband's life-insurance payout. Uh, Bradley James. Pre-existing? No, no. We didn't know he had a heart condition. He was healthy, all of his tests were fine. Uh, I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to call you back. It's my son's school. Hi, this is Leslie. What? Mom, look, it's not my fault, I was waiting in line for the bus and this kid just started trash-talking me. - Well, what'd he say? - Well... He said I was like special-ed and I need to take the short bus. Well, where was Ava? I thought she was driving you home. I, uh, think she was staying late to study. I don't... Look, I'm really sorry that kid said those things to you. He shouldn't have. Period. But you can't... Ah, you-you can't just punch someone because they offend you. This is not you, Ryan. Ry... Look, are you sure you're taking your meds every day? You keep asking me that. And I'm going to keep asking you. Yes. I have. Yes. Okay. From now on you take your pills in front of me. That's how it's gonna be from now on. What, okay, you don't trust me anymore? I'm trying to help you, Ryan. You're trying to help me? Me? Why not Ava? She's the one who... Who what? Um, forget it. Ryan... Yes! Fifty-four seconds, Ava! Ava? You're all good? Yeah, I'm good. I'm just catching my breath. - Hey. - The letter from UW came today. You opened it? What'd it say? Well, there's still Ohio State. - No, there's not. - What do you mean? I mean, you're not getting in, Maddy. - There's no way. - How do you know that? I see kids with stronger applications get rejected every day. Your track is average at best. You swore you'd get your grades up, and you didn't. You blew it, Maddy. What? So you're just gonna give up on my future, just like that? No, I tried to get you to apply yourself. If you wanna get the rewards, you need to put in the work. I have been putting in the work. I dance. Oh. That's a hobby. No one makes a living at that. Have you done the research? Because I have. Well, maybe if you came to my competitions this weekend, then you would actually see how good I am. I'm trying to set realistic expectations for you, so you're not disappointed later in life. Hey. You okay? Yeah. I'm fine. What are you doing tonight? You wanna go party? I don't know. I have a lot to catch up on. Ava, it's time you actually start living your life. Hey. I have to head down to the event location now to set up. It's gonna be a late evening and an early morning, so I probably won't see you two until dinner tomorrow. Great. Well, I hope it goes well. I've got everything under control here. Studying on a Friday night? Why don't you relax, take a load off? You know, you could watch a movie. - Get a friend over if you want. - No. No, no, no, it's okay. This is important. Do you know how many kids I'm up against for scholarships, by the way? Ava. Come here. Come here for a second. Look, I know you've been under a lot of pressure this year. You've been strong for me and your brother, and especially with his recent... struggles. And I know it's been a burden on you. But if I've learned anything over the last year is that you can't control everything. Or anything, really. Look, I'm just worried that you're putting too much pressure on yourself over these scholarships. So what, y-you're gonna tell me not to worry about it now? Mom, like, your business is struggling, you're up all night worrying about bills. I'm not stupid. Besides, school's the only thing keeping me sane right now. - Ava, are you okay? - What do you mean? Yes, I'm fine. I just... Like... What? Oh. - Mrs. Price, of course. - Answer it, then. No. No, no. I can call her back. - What were you gonna say? - Nothing. Like I said, I have everything under control, so... Well, I should get going. But call me if you need anything, okay? You promise? - Of course. - All right. - I love you, Ava James. - Love you, too. All right. Have a good night. You, too. I'm going out to study. Yeah, okay. Study. Yeah, I wouldn't touch those. Mom's watching me take them now, so... Look, if she calls, tell her I'm here, okay? - I don't want her to worry. - You know, it's funny. You're, uh, sneaking out doing drugs and I'm somehow the problem child. Promise me, Ry? - Yeah, fine. - Okay. Goodnight. Goodnight. Drink up, trophy wife. You guys, quit being so boring and come play. I notice you always wear that. Yeah, my, uh, dad gave it to me before I competed at State. Madison told me what happened to him. I'm sorry. Hey, everyone, I have an announcement. It is vodka o'clock. Let's go. I said shots! All right, Wes, let's show these fools how we're gonna slay tomorrow. - Let's do it. - Xavier, take a video. I don't know how you guys are gonna dance tomorrow. If I had a track meet, I'd be so paranoid. See, that's the problem with you, Ava James. You don't know how to play hard. So, did you bring those little white pills I asked you to bring? Uh, I told you I'm all out. So then get more. Call up your girl. If you want it, you should call her. I'm not your drug-dealer. Oh, really? Because I'm pretty sure that this video would suggest differently. What is this? You filmed us? Madison, come on, that's not cool. Please, you're the one that wanted her to come over just to bring the pills. Because you told me to. Oh, and look, she came running. I wanted you to come, Ava. Imagine if my mom knew that you were doping before track meets. You'd be off the team. And say goodbye to all of your scholarships. Why are you doing this? All I'm asking for is for you to hold up your end of the bargain. What bargain? W-we didn't have a bargain. Hey, relax. I'm not gonna show it to anybody. Call up welfare-girl and get her to bring the Dex. And then we can finally start the party. Let's go. Good shot. - Hello? - Casey, um, it's Ava. Look, there's this party tonight at Xavier's. Could-could you bring me some more pills? Sorry, Ava, I can really use the money, but this whole thing just feels too sketch. Hey, listen to me. Madison has this, this video of us. It could ruin everything for me. Don't mess this up for me, Casey. - Bring the pills, okay? - Okay, Ava. But then I'm done. Casey's on her way. Oh. Perfect. I knew you'd sort it out. Please relax, I'm not gonna show it to anybody. Wow, look at Ava James go. Still think I can't play hard? Oh, amazing. Thank you two so much. If you could take that... And if you could take that. The catering tent is just around the side of the building that way, okay? Good morning, Mrs. Price. You're here bright and early. Because you don't trust me to do anything? Mrs. Price, do you, uh, want to go over the revised seating... Oh, my God... Hello. Please tell me this is the florist. Yes, this is she. Ava? I got a call. Uh, this is my daughter Ava James and I... Leslie James? I'm Detective Parsons. Look, I don't understand what's going on here. I got a call, I was told that my daughter was in an accident. But this, this isn't my daughter. This isn't Ava. I understand, but when the EMT showed up, she mentioned the name Ava James. Not to mention the fact that she placed a 911 phone call with this cell phone registered under a family plan to a Leslie James. This is Ava's phone. Do you have any idea why she would have your daughter's phone? I-I... No, I-I have no idea. Do you know where your daughter was last night? Yeah, she was at home. Were you with her the whole time? Uh, I was a-at work. But Ava was home with my son, Ryan. Mrs. James, I'm just trying to figure out what happened here. I-if you were at work, how do you know that your daughter was home the whole time? Can you excuse me a minute? I just need to call home and find out what's going on here. As long as you understand that we still need to talk. Of course. Ryan, have you... I-is Ava there? Is everything okay? - Mom, what do you mean? - Ava. Is she there? - Uh, yeah, yeah. - Okay, can I speak to her? Yes, she-she's in the shower. I'll get her to call you soon, okay? Okay, thanks, a-as soon as she gets out, get her to call me. Perfect, will do. Okay, bye. No, Ryan, honey, I... - Mom? Mom? - Where's your sister? - Ava! Ava! - Um, mom, wait. Tell me the truth. Where is Ava? She went out for a little bit. Where is your sister? She said she was going to study last night. But she never came home. I didn't want you to worry, so... What? Well, study with who? Where did she go? I don't know, she didn't tell me. Hi, Brie. Uh, have you seen Ava? Were you two studying last night by any chance? Okay. Yeah. Thanks. Okay, Alex, uh, thank you. Uh, can you just call me if you hear anything? Okay. Thanks. Detective Parsons. Mrs. James, I thought I made myself clear back at the hospital that we still needed to talk. Uh, I-I'm sorry, I-I needed to come home and talk to my son. Has Ava been in contact with you? My son just told me that Ava left the house last night to study. I-I don't know where she went, uh, her car's not here, and I haven't heard from her. Her car's gone? Has she done that before? No. Never. She is extremely responsible. When did she sneak out? Uh, she didn't sneak out. She left to study. - And what time was that? - I-I don't know. Uh, sometime last night. So what do we do? Do we, do we file a missing person's report? Mrs. James, I assure you that our top priority is finding Ava. I just hope that she can shed light on this hit-and-run. Hit-and-run? Wait, d-do you think that Ava had something to do with that girl getting hurt? My daughter is missing, Detective Parsons. She's not a criminal. Either way, I'm sure you can understand why we're so keen to speak with her, so if she contacts you, I need you to contact me right away. Do you understand what I'm saying, Mrs. James? Is that clear? Uh, yes, of course. What are these doing in Ava's room? - Um, I don't, I don't know. - Cut the bull, Ry. I need an honest answer. Why were these in Ava's drawer? - Mom, I don't know! - Ava's missing, okay? Do you understand? She could be hurt or she could be in danger. Ava started taking my Dex a couple of months ago. Like, once or twice a week to help her study, I guess. I don't know, she said it gave her more energy. Well, um, yeah, then she started taking it more and more and hanging out with Madison's crowd. Madison Russell? - Hi, Leslie. - Hi, Caroline. How are you? I haven't seen you in years. Look, I don't know where Ava is. And Ryan told me that she's been hanging out with Madison again. I just need to know if they were together last night. I-I'm so sorry, um... Madison was at a friend's last night, um, Xavier Morales. - Xavier? - He's the senator's son. But she has a big dance competition this weekend. She wouldn't miss it for the world. Okay, look, could you just call her and ask her if she saw Ava last night? Sure. Sure. You've got my voicemail, but, ew, send me a text if you want something. Probably got it off for the competition. I'll ask her to call if she knows anything. Uh, Caroline, I don't know how to say this, but, uh... Look, I think that Madison and Ava are doing prescription drugs together. - Excuse me? - It's an ADHD medication. They got off my son. And I think that they're doing it together. Leslie, I can't imagine what you're going through right now with your husband and now with Ava. But do you have any idea what this would do to Ava's scholarships? My daughter's missing. Right now I couldn't care less. Just if you hear anything, please, just call me. Sure. - Hi? - Xavier Morales? Guilty. Can I help you with something? I'm Leslie. I'm Ava James' mom. Was she with you last night? - With me? - Did you see her? Was she here with Madison? Ava? Nope. No, I haven't seen her. No, I mean, not since school. Listen, I have no interest in getting you in trouble, you understand? So if you've seen her, doesn't matter what you did, I don't care. I just need to find her. I-I'm really sorry. I know she's been having some trouble lately. What do you mean trouble? I mean it's understandable with everything she's been going through. I-I shouldn't have said anything. I hope she's okay. I-if there's anything I can do. Is she gone? What did you tell her? - What did you say? - Nothing, obviously. People are looking for her. Yeah, dude. So? What do we do? Seriously, guys! What is the plan? Ask her. She's the mastermind. Well, give me a second, would you? Are you kidding me right now? I just need to think. We have to call the police. You wanna call the cops? And then what? We're all screwed? Could you guys shout a bit louder? We can't just do nothing! You don't think I already know that? Guys, stop messing around. Stop looking at me, this is on all of us. - Someone's outside. - Y-you gotta hide. Go, go, go, go, go. - Hey! What are you doing? - Is she here? - A-are you crazy? - Ava! Ava! Yo, this is my house. I'm gonna call the cops. - I heard arguing. - It's called a movie, lady. She's not here, okay? I'm gonna find out what happened to her. And if you're lying to me, you're gonna regret it. Detective, have you heard anything? Have they found Ava? I was about to ask you the same thing. We got some new information we need to talk to you about. Ryan, what are you doing here? Um, well, the police called the house first, so I biked here. - Um, no, I wanna help, mom. - No. No, I need you to go home. I can't handle you getting hurt, too. You said there was some new information? Yeah, let's, uh, talk over here. So, apparently, the mother came lookin' for her. Said she was supposed to work the late shift last night. - We've identified her as... - Casey Lang. - Ry, do you know her? - Um, uh... Yeah, I mean, yeah, I've s-seen her around school. Are Ava and Casey friends? I mean, do they know each other? I don't, I don't know. I think Ava tutors her or something. I-I mean, she tutors a lot of people, though. So I'm not sure. You know, the best thing you could do for Ava is tell me everything, right, 'cause at this point it's not looking too good for her. Wait. "Not looking too good for her?" Well, Ava and her car went missing right after Casey was discovered severely injured in a hit-and-run. On top of that, Casey ended up with Ava's cell phone. Speakin' of, Mrs. James, would you mind tellin' me where that cell phone ended up? It's, uh, it's at home. I thought I knew the code, but I don't. I'm gonna be sending someone over to retrieve that. And consider yourself lucky that I'm not charging you for tampering with my evidence. Detective, I don't know what's going on here, but I have no interest in protecting Ava if she's at fault but I need to know that she's okay. And we're not doing enough. And what is it you think we should be doing? Madison Russell, Xavier Morales and-and Westley something, they were with Ava last night, we think. I went to Xavier's house and he said that he hadn't seen her, but I think he was lying. So you're questioning people now? His house is a two-minute drive from the accident site. What, you think that's a coincidence? Okay, Mrs. James, I assure you that we're gonna question everybody we need to. But in the meantime, if you interfere with my investigation in any way, shape or form, I'm gonna have to arrest you for obstruction of justice. Do you understand? And I'm gonna need those names. Parsons. Yeah. Mom, um, a couple of days ago I saw Ava and Casey together. - When? - Ava came on to me. Asking me if I might know anyone else who was on Dex. Listen, just make sure... Ava's car was just found at the edge of the city, abandoned. - Is there any sign of her? - Nothing yet. But the damage to the headlight is consistent with the hit-and-run. So if you hear from Ava, you need to call me... immediately. Leslie James? Erin Pullen, Channel 79 News. - Just go. Get in the house. - Do you have a moment? Mrs. James! Sources tell us your daughter is under investigation for last night's hit-and-run. Would you care to comment? My daughter, Ava James, is missing. This is not like her, she's a good person. She's my little girl and we have no idea where she is. My daughter, Ava James, is missing. This is not like her, she's a good person. She's my little girl, and we have no idea where she is. Please, if anyone knows anything, I, I just want my daughter back. This is bad. It's already on the news. Bro, you need to chill. It was an accident, okay? The cops will understand. What do you mean? We were high out of our minds. Yeah. And whose genius idea was that? - Are you okay? - Yeah. Just trying not to be so uptight. Hey. Someone order delivery? Now we can get the party started. Holy crap! You running a pharmacy? Oh. Oh. - Nice. - Mm... Oh, yeah. Ladies. Come on. Gee golly, it's not very obedient of you, Ava James. You have no idea what you're talking about, Madison. And what do you think the news is gonna say about the senator's son having a party where a drunk girl accidentally blacks out in his pool? Please. You were cheering her on the whole time. The whole thing was your idea. I didn't know she was gonna spaz out. My life is so messed up, you have no idea. I am not perfect, okay? I was the reason my dad had a heart attack. Did you know that? Yeah, I told him I, uh, quit swimming, that it was too much pressure and that it was all his fault. And we got in this huge fight... and then he died, at the lake, with half the town watching. My mother cries herself to sleep. And my brother is falling apart because of me. And you wanna tell me that I'm perfect? Whoa. Okay. I am so sick of it. She shouldn't be doing this. Shut up. She's finally being fun. Is she okay? What's happening to her? What is she doing? I think she's having a seizure or something. We have to get her out. What? - I'm calling 911. - No, you're not doing that. Are you kidding? She needs to go to the hospital. And what the... She could die! What... She's fine. She just needs to puke. Go get her! Go! Ava's blocking me in. Go inside right now and get Ava's purse and get her keys. Now! Mom, you should really eat something. I just can't find her passcode. Is it possible that Ava actually did this? That she just made a huge mistake and got scared? No. No way. We both know that's not Ava. I don't know. I didn't even know what she was going through, so maybe I'm wrong about this, too. But why wouldn't she at least call me? It doesn't make any sense. She wouldn't just disappear. Mom... - Come look at this. - What is it? Madison's social media. Listen. Play it again. That's-that's Ava's laugh. I mean, I'd recognize it anywhere. She was there last night. This is proof. They were lying. Hello, officer. It's detective. Detective Parsons. Are you Xavier Morales? Everyone keeps asking that today. I-is this about Casey? You know anything about it? - Only what I saw on the news. - Mm-hmm. Were you with Casey or Ava James last night? No. I-I don't know them super well. It's not like we, uh, hang out or anything. Okay. Were you with anyone else last night? No. Had a chill night in. You know, it's funny you should say that, we have a neighbor saying they think they heard a pretty exciting time going on in your backyard late into the night. You know, like a party. Okay. - You got me. - Ah. My parents are away at this political fundraiser this weekend. - Man, home alone. - Mm-hmm. Okay, I wasn't supposed to have anyone over, but couple of friends stopped by. Yeah, they're at this dance competition today. Uh, but I can give you their numbers. Yeah, I'll take those numbers if you don't mind. Okay, everyone and the news already thinks that Ava did this. She's the only one that knows what happened last night. She's the only one that could screw us over. You don't mind if I have a look inside? Actually, uh, I'd rather not. - Why is that? - I mean... Don't you need, like, a warrant for that? Warrants are for people who don't wanna cooperate. You know what, I-I think I'll give my dad a call first. Maybe you know him. - Senator Morales. - Mm-hmm. He's got some pretty good lawyers. Yeah, I'm sure he does. And I'm fairly certain he'd tell me not to let you in. - Yeah. - Sorry about that. That's okay, if you, uh, remember anything... make sure you give me a call. Just 'cause you're a senator's kid don't mean you can't get in trouble. It's just Casey, if she wakes up, no one is going to believe her. She's a screw-up. But, Ava... We have to get rid of her. We have no other option. You're awake? Hello? Hello, it's Xavier? Calm down, Ava. Let's just talk this through. Where do you think you're going? Help me, you idiots! - No! No! Ah! - Shut up! Stop! Get off me! Get off! Get off! - What are you doing? - I'm gonna go over there. - Okay, I'm coming with you. - No, no. I need you to stay here in case Ava comes home. You know, mom, let me help. No, you've been enough help already, Ryan. Detective Parsons, what are you doing here? I've been calling you. We have a warrant to search the premises. What? Paint from Ava's car was found on Casey Lang and we're looking for anything that would help us locate her. Well, I dunno what you expect to find. I've torn her room apart. - We're about to find out. - Listen. I got a strange call from Xavier Morales. We need to go over there right now. I just came from there, I'm fairly certain he was calling to give you the heads-up. Are you certain that Ava hasn't tried to contact you or Ryan in any way? No, no, if she would've contacted us, I wouldn't be terrified for her life right now. Ryan found a video, it proves that Ava was there last night. - And that those kids are lying. - Yeah, we got a video as well. Anonymous tip, apparently, Ava not only knew Casey, but she had reason to need her to keep quiet. Perhaps she went to Xavier's, got intoxicated and then got in her car to go look for Casey. Either way, I'm gonna need to get that phone from you, if you don't mind. Thank you. No! Dad, I-I know you're busy, but... Look... I think I messed up. I-I needed to call you. W-what do you mean what have I done this time? I-I'm asking for your help here. What are you doing? Uh, I-I gotta go, dad. Are you, are you seriously calling your daddy right now? And leaving us to clean up this mess? The mess you made, Madison. The mess I'm cleaning up. I'll go calm her down. I'm going to help you, but you have to be quiet. - Why are you doing this? - Last night was so messed up. Where's Casey? She tried to help you and Madison hit her with your car. And everyone panicked. Those guys are losing it. Westley, you have to get me out of here, please. She's going to kill me. What do you think you're doing? - I'm letting her go. - No, you're not. I'm not gonna let you ruin us over some stupid, horny crush. Okay? You let her go, and what happens to us? What happens to you? You're gonna go to prison like your dad. I don't care! Whatever! I'll go to prison, then. - Well, I won't! - Please, please. Just listen to me, okay? I know it was all a mistake. I-I know you didn't mean to hurt Casey. You told her about Casey? What is wrong with the both of you? Do you not understand what this means for us? I don't care. I'm taking her home. 59.17? Get-get off! Ah! Look, Ryan, I'm sor... Ava! Stop! Stop! Stop! Well, what are you doing? No! - Mom? - Oh, God! Ryan. You could've gotten yourself killed. They've got Ava. I don't know where they're going. - But they have her. - Okay, let's go. Okay. Mads, the lake? What are you doing here? What are we gonna do with her? Well, where are we going? Uh, yes, they have my sister in their car. No, I told... The license plate is LCSB-683. Hey, I-I don't know where they're headed, but... - East! East on Road 16. - E-east on Road 16. - They're going into Hart Lake. - Um... Going to Hart Lake. I... Your phone died. Her dad died at this lake. It'll just seem like she went crazy off the decks, hit Casey and then she couldn't, she couldn't handle it. - Oh, my God. - What other choice do we have? What about Westley? He'll rat us out. No, he won't. You saw him, he didn't even wanna call the cops. He's a pushover. We'll shut him up. I'm sorry. It's all my fault. I should've told you. I-I just, I didn't wanna be more of a burden. No, no, Ryan, this is not your fault. Ava, last night I think she tried to tell me, and I didn't, I didn't see it, and I wasn't there for her. And I haven't been there for either of you, and I'm so sorry. But, Ryan, you are not a burden. Do you hear me? No, you risked your life for her tonight. What if it's too late? Help me get her out. Mads, are we really doing this? What else do you wanna do? You wanna call your daddy? You wanna tell him that we hit a girl with our car and then held another one hostage? What other choice do we have? Help me get her out, please. We're almost done. They've got Ava. Okay, look, there's a charger in here somewhere, okay? I need you to call Detective Parsons, okay? Get Parsons on the line and you stay on the line with him. You do not leave this car! Do you hear me? Do not leave this car! We need to weigh her down. Okay. Okay. - What's that for? - Well... Give time for the DNA to wash off. - No. - Yeah, yeah. It's okay. It's okay. It's gonna be... Madison! Stop right there. Madison, look, I-I know this was, this was a big accident, okay? I-I know that-that you didn't intend for any of this to happen. Okay, I-I-I... You're not in trouble. I just, I need you to step away from Ava. Okay, just come over here and talk to me and it's gonna be okay. No, Madison, it's too late. It's too late. I've seen you. Okay, if you do this now, you'll never get out of it. Think about it. - Just throw her in. - Madison, I-I know your mom. No, Madison, I know your mom. I know your mom and I know that she-she's worried about you and that she loves you and she would do anything that she could to protect you. Now I know you're full of it! My mother would rather see me at the bottom of this lake than ever humiliate her! No, I-I promise, she's proud of you. Shut up. Ma-Madison, I-I-I talked to her today. I talked to her, a-and she said that she was so proud of you, o-o-of your dancing, and that you a-a-re a great dancer. Shut up! You're lying! Xavier, throw her in! - Mads... - Just do it, you idiot! No! No! - Ava! Ava's in the water! - Okay, okay, okay. - She's in the water! - Okay. - Where is she? Where is she? - Oh, she's there, she's there. She's there, she's there, she's there. Where? Oh, God... Here, here, here. Pull. I got her. Ava. Ava, honey. Oh, God, I'm so sorry. I'm so, so sorry. Ava, please. Ava, please stay with me... Put your hands in the air! Hands in the air! On your knees, now! Do it! Ava, stay with me. Ava, honey, it's okay. - She's there. - You'll be okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Hey! I can't believe you're out. You make it sound like I broke out of prison or something. I like it. Oh, my God! Everything looks so great. I mean, it's the least I could do. I know I've said it before, but I'm really sorry, Casey. Ava, for the hundredth time, I forgive you, okay? Besides, I get a sick insurance payout, so goodbye, Chicken Barrel, hello, college. That's incredible! Guys, did you see this? "Charges came down after three local teens were involved in a hit-and-run cover-up, two are sentenced to six months in juvenile detention, and the third, court-ordered community service." - Let's put that away, shall we? - Yeah, sorry. Uh, Casey, anyways, um, how are you with sound systems? Kidding? I was AV Club captain two years running. How did I guess? All right. Oh, thank you. Okay. So, the chairs should be arriving any minute and there's gonna be five stand-up tables around the perimeter where people can just chat and eat hors d'oeuvres... - What? - Nothing. You're-you're a natural at this. Well, I mean, I am looking for a summer job. - Now that I'm done with rehab. - Okay. Part-time, of course. I, uh, promised Coach Nassar I'd start training early for senior year. You're rejoining the swim team? - Honey, are you sure? - Yeah. I'm ready. And no pressure this time. I'm doing this for me. Have I told you yet today how impressed I am with you? I take after my mom. She's pretty impressive herself. Yes, she is. very impressive. Oh. Oh, boy. I think Ryan needs our help. - He really does. Really does. - Okay. Testing, testing. One, two, three. One, two, three. Thank you. Thank you, we'll be here all night. Okay, okay, okay. Here you go.
