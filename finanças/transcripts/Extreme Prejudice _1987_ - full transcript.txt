To the left are the kluisloketjes. And the bad news? - There is a time slot. Stands 20 to 10. We need him to blow up. If we walk in the night.

We loved everyone for the crazy. - You and that damn Cash, eh? You need to now see him with his white suit and bodyguard in Pancho Villa outfit. As if it's just a game for him. - It goes a bit further than that. Crazy isn't it, how those things run. The straight path is the hardest thing, the bad path is the easiest. A law of nature. As water the path of least resistance. Meandering rivers, bad people. - I may still. I try to have him as a friend to see. A smart thief knows exactly how he you for taking. To women you can also leave. Love on the go open your eyes for Chub Luke. Think about it. You can count on it that he catch you trying to take. The best.

They are stoned and they continue to be stoned. They spray, sniff and swallow. Take the guests of Luke. The one who wanted to shoot and his brother Chub. That with the schorem in the sea. I have fished with their father. They were nice kids, no rabid dogs, who want to bite. We create a profile of that cowboy. We know where we stand. A resorted to bank robbery during the day requires a diversion. We blow up one or another building. A barn or so. A church, a school. - We are Going to nitpick? Indeed. This is America. There are legal roads. Why no injunction? The resorted to bank robbery is an alibi to be in that safety deposit boxes to noses. A matter of national security. - But on the face of a common resorted to bank robbery. Will you go complain that the legislation women allows as a Ranger. Me best. As long as they are 1 meter 95, and link as a tanning door. Pleuriswetgeving. Only predators are even worse than politicians. What is going on, Arturo? - Four men. Drug runners, I think. Anglo or Mex? - Mexicans. Were always waiting. There came yet another child. Large, with a beard. Chub, they call him. Just go inside? - I know Chub from my eighth. You said just what a good boy it was. I'm going to have a beer with him to drink. Sounds reasonable. You tell him just how his brother have been shot. I go around the back. - Then do I keep the front in the holes. Go stand there. Can I ask you to keep an eye on. Time to pay, jack. Garza, he is behind that Chevy. Go eropaf. The crooks.

Do you still talk to me? I've been saying for two years... that I love you. And now we don't talk more. What is it, jack? I know you. We have often had a fight, but now it is different. So, I know you not. It takes some time. Just don't talk. You do not want to continue with me? - That said, I do not. Don't talk, " I said. You and I and Cash... it is difficult.

If you want me to have it examined... It appears that you're dead, just like the other two that are stuck. Why robs the army of a bank? Cash Bailey. He washes his drug money white through the bank here. And he kept compromising documents. There should be a lot more behind it. He was the main DEA informant in Mexico... until three years ago a drugsimperium began to build up. Good trick, to get you guys to register them as deceased. In other countries, it is useful. Except if you get caught. I go to Mexico. I'm going to finish the job. Bailey yesterday, the border has come, I hear. I think he's with your girlfriend to Mexico. Let my men free.

None of us likes, but we do what me must do. And you know that we do it well. All we are missing a Fry. I also. Do not forget that, youth who. We have made a mistake. A man lost.

I take both of you to take home. That's for everyone the best. Sarita you may have. We can't find each other. But I thank you for the invitation. - It is not an invitation. I knew that guts had, but not that you was crazy. That private army of you doesn't interest me one nut. This is something between the two of us. I'm here for you. It's personal. So I have no choice. We must together fight, isn't it? No room to manoeuvre. First, I would like to know for sure that all is well with Sarita. Probably. Then, you concentrate better. Finally, you should me. But first, give your weapon. Otherwise you get your great love. I want you not armed with her in the neighborhood. Imagine that you are the hero is going to hang out and my boys are going to shoot. That would be Cash not like. - A Bad habit, your weapon issue. Forget Sarita. I get my barker and we'll fight it here and now. Only well on. You have it back in time for the finale. You know me. I do what I promise. - I always knew. You only promises so little. You don't know how happy I am that I see you. These guys here can my conversation not to follow.

Two friends drink together, just like old times. Why can we no longer friends? I mean it seriously. We are like bosom friends grew up. When I am gone. To the big city. Dallas, Houston, Chicago, New York. It was nothing. The only thing I ever afraid of me, was me. I came back and was Ranger, and it was good again. When I got home, I went looking for my old friend. He was not there. He was gone. Gone. In the error gone. You went into error. You was your sense of humor is lost. That uniform. Everyone makes mistakes, but you're worse than I am. You were almost there. When changed you. - That was when I saw the light. Remove the scales fell from the eyes. I saw how I could get what I wanted. Everything. That light that you saw, that feels good, or wrong? Right and wrong do not exist. The only choices. Everyone makes choices. Did you want to do me that right to deny it? I got myself worked up. Nothing gift. And no one takes me off what I have now. That did I already. Jesús, come here. There Is something going on, chef? Everything is in tip-top order, on one little thing after. That we solve it in that way. Him might I also. Really, I should Jesús like, to me tekortdeed. It is not the money, but the abuse of trust. Monday, get that bastard out of here. It is not a nice sight for a lady. Good land is here. Here, you can do what you want, as long as you and your friends gives the money. An old-fashioned revolution would not hurt here. We get music or how does that work? Play, or I shoot the whole band into confusion. Miguel, a bottle of champagne. Don't worry. I want to first talk and then you get your gun. What are you going to do? A bottle of tequila. - I have people for that. I get like to things yourself, Cash. One move and I'll shoot your head off. Do you do understand? - Create doesn't kill me, please. Stay on the bed. Yes? Stay on the bed. What are you doing here? - The instructions have changed. Everything is a quarter of an hour shifted. And we need you to shoot. But I don't like that. I lunch with the governor, I'm going to liefdadigheidsavonden. No one gives so many poor sloebers to eat... and saves so many whales and so on. But I have no one to talk to. No one of home. Look for coverage if they are going to shoot. Save your own skin, Ranger. That song your mother have learned, your favorite song... do you want me to sing? With your head on my shoulder, just like before. One more time. Sing it with feeling. Maybe merry, I assume, and I want to jack not to shoot. . Merv, wait a minute. - What are you doing here, gen? The Federales and the DEA do together. We have no protection. Hence resorted to bank robbery. - Where are the books? In my office. - Bowl. I'll give you one more chance. You want to be with me, I know that. I was the first. I will always be the first. We go to Cancun, take a cottage, go swimming in the sea. We pick up the thread again. You're crazy. You're crazy, Cash. That all the things that I with Cash have done? Give but. I take it with us. - There is no copy. This is of Cash. I wish him and protect myself. - It can't without his permission. He would pisnijdig. - It's okay. Believe me. A friend of you? It is far, eh? It's a beautiful day to make someone cold. I will give you a fair chance. Because we are friends. Back to back, ten paces, and we pop it loose. On to the eternal jachtvelden. May the best man win.

So, the mood. Are you ready for? There is a lot of money, Larry. Samsam. We pinch there just for a break. - There is never a mission, eh? How much do you remember about it? - Ten million dollars. This whole assignment had you up. We venture our lives, and you lubricate 'm. I have the country 20 years served. The one kutklus after the other. I have done things that you don't like people can ask for. Heroes do not exist. We are cogs in the system. We are going to do it. Lupo, you are the one that counts. Say it. - I am ready. Imbecile. When you do your eyes one time open? They have shit on you. You are just like me. What do you do then, sergeant? Nine... ten. What happens? - The major has us conned. Hackett and Bailey do together. They want us all dead. We must be behind the major. Take him down as soon as you see him. Ready? - What do you do then. I don't have the whole day. It's already after four. We do it clean. Let your friend until the count of three and we go out of our roof. Sarita, count. Count, I say. You guys are both disturbed. Then we will have to do it ourselves. If you really want to, you can get everything. Also women and beer. Give you are about. I can't. Snap. Give you about it, I will take you home. Like I said, I'm in it too deep. Say that we are now able to stop, or continue to shoot. Say it. Do you want to negotiate? - What do you suggest? We will not let you go home. Other times you do something for me. Then you help someone out of the cell. Squeeze a blind eye. Does not go through. - Stupid of you. I already have something done for you. Now, you have to have the white suit. He was indeed crazy. We no longer work for gringos. From now on we are own boss. We need the money here. I know all about it. You have me a disservice. It is a good deal. I trust you. Now I'm a businessman. Hasta luego, amigo.
