"My name is Steve Keiver." "That is what all the sirens are all about." "They were screaming for me." "I was very popular that night." "Everybody wanted me. Dead or alive." "Big Franko wanted me dead." "I don't think it mattered to the police how they got me, just so they got me." "You'd think there's a thousand hiding places in a big city but there aren't." "No. Not when they want you." "They turn a spotlight on you, narrowing the circle. Closing in for the kill." "They let you wear yourself out until you are too tired to run any more." "And you stand there, hypnotised. Waiting for them to get it over with." "You wonder how it happened and where it all really began." "It started somewhere out there beyond the searchlights and the sirens." "You had ideals and you went to a top law school." "Then you went to work for an insurance company." "But it wasn't any of those things." "I think it really started when I got a telegram that Ellen was coming home." "It really started that morning at the airport." "Attention please." "American Airlines Flight 482 from Fort Worth .." "Dallas and St Louis now arriving at Gate 4." Ellen. - Steve. Ellen, let me look at you. Why, you've grown up. When you left you were a spindly-legged, freckle-faced brat. And look at you now. You have gotten tall and beautiful and you have .. You've filled out. - Steve, stop it. It's only been 3 weeks. - They seem like light years. Don't ever do it again. I've really missed you. Come on. I'll get your bags. "Attention, please." "American Airlines Flight 576 .." My kid is outside. - Yes, sir. Cone on, honey. We're right out here. - Alright. There is Harry. Welcome home, Miss Sayburn. - Thank you, Harry. Thank you, dear. Thank you. Well, tell me all about it. How was Sun Valley? It was very nice. You want me to check and see if you have any broken legs or anything? No thank you. I'm fine. You certainly are. I am a lucky fellow. No more trips alone for you. I'm not taking any more chances. You might meet another guy. I tried to phone you Saturday at the hotel but .. The fool clerk told me you'd checked out and left for Europe. He must have been drunk. Then I got your wire and I knew everything was okay. Steve. - Yeah? I have had time to do a lot of thinking. You were supposed to be skiing. I am serious. - I am sorry. Tell the court what happened in your own words. Well I .. I am not a one-room flat girl. I don't want to raise my children in the kind of poverty I was raised in. Steve, I couldn't stand it. I want security. Ellen honey, if you're just patient .. - I've waited a year, Steve. You can't deposit patience in a bank and you sure can't raise a family on it. We are going to do alright. I think we'll send little Ellen to a private school .. Where they can try to teach her how to look like you. Stevie can go to a public school. And then maybe Harvard or even Oxford, on a scholarship. Ellen, we are never going to be rich. That is not security. But we love each other. You can deposit that in my bank. I am going to work as hard as I can to get you everything you want. Now honey, I think we've waited long enough. Tomorrow I'm going to go in and hit Manston for a raise. Good afternoon, Miss Sayburn. Here. I'll get your bags. - Thank you. Watch out for this one. It's pretty heavy. It's heavy. Yep. Can I come up for a minute? I am sorry, Steve. I am awfully tired. I'll call you in the morning. - Right. A nice girl. The best. You are invited to our wedding, Harry. Thanks, Steve. My mother did like you told her. The guy who ran her down paid the hospital bill and gave her 200 bucks. Good. Ma thinks you are the greatest lawyer in the world. How much do I owe you? - Well. What's on your meter? $4.95. - That's it. Make it $5.95. Keep a dollar for yourself. - Thanks, Steve. Yes. What is the number? 3 - 2. 1-9-2-1-7-0. Alright. I'll have it checked this afternoon. Steve. Mr Manston is alone now. Oh, thanks Joan. Keep your fingers crossed for me. If you get it I'll cook dinner for you tonight to celebrate. If I get it I'll be getting married tonight. You can cook dinner for me tomorrow night. Come in. And in conclusion you may inform your board of underwriters .. That we are perfectly willing to cooperate in every possible way. Expecting to hear from you soon. Yours very truly. Yes, Steve? Mr Manston, I'd like to talk to you. - Sit down. Thank you, sir. - You look tired. I'm afraid I didn't sleep very well last night. I know. I could never sleep either before I hit the boss for a raise. Steve, at this point I'm supposed to give you big build-up. You know: 'we have had our eye on you for a long time'. 'You've a great future. Keep it up and someday you'll be chief attorney here'. I see. - Well, that's the speech. And in your case it is true. You keep it up and someday you will be chief attorney here. That's a big job. I know. Ladders were made for patient men. Don't try to climb too fast. Mr Manston, I am getting married. I need a raise now. I'm going to be perfectly honest with you, Steve. I think you deserve a raise. But with business the way it is now .. I've been asked not to approve any raises for the time being. When the situation changes, I will be glad to discuss it with you again. I am sorry. So am I. Well. Oh, here is the claim for the Belrose Fur Company. Draw up the papers, will you. - Yes, sir. $40,000? Any report on the burglars yet? I'm not interested in the burglars. I am interested in getting those furs back. Right now I would pay $10,000 and no questions asked. Now don't get me wrong. I'd like to see those crooks put where they belong. But my first duty is to the stockholders of this company. If we keep paying out on these claims then there won't be any company. Yes, sir. Alright. Prepare the releases. We'll pay. Is there anything else? No, sir. Hiya, Mr Keiver. - Evening, Harry. Harry, I need your help. I'm trying find someone. He is a mobster. I have no idea who he is. Where would I find him? If I didn't know it was you Steve I'd think you was nuts. I probably am, Harry. But this is important. I know a couple of their hangouts. They ain't healthy for strangers. - Take me there. Are you sure? - Harry. I guess you are sure. I'd better go in with you. I'll be alright, Harry. You wait out here for me. What's yours, sir? - Scotch and soda. A lot of the boys around tonight, huh? - Yeah. Want to see anybody in particular? Kind of. I just got in from out of town. A friend of mine told me I could get taken care of here. Max tells me you're new in town. - Yeah. I was told I could meet some of the boys here. What is your racket? Keeping my mouth shut, mainly. Smart. I am kind-of the Emily post around here. If you want to meet anybody maybe I can help you. Maybe. - I'm listening. A few weeks ago some furs were stolen from the Belrose Fur Company. I want to contact the men who did it. If the furs are returned I'll get $10,000 for them. No questions asked. Well, why didn't you say so? Follow me. Steve! Steve, what happened? Take it easy. What did they to do you? Are you alright? - Yeah. I'm fine. Just let me sit down for a minute. I ought to go in there and slug them. Why don't you? - I might get killed. I'd better take you home. - No, no. We haven't found my friend yet. Can't we look for them tomorrow? Tomorrow I will probably have my head examined for what I am doing tonight. Where is the next place? - It's called The Sirocco. A guy named Marty Calbert owns it. He's at the bottom of every racket in town. He sounds fine. Let's go. It is sort-of a clip-joint. Here. You might need this. Thanks, Harry. Cigarettes? I want to see Monty Calbert. I hope you got good eyes, mister. He is in Florida. Thanks. Can I help you? Or are you just window shopping? If I run short of anything I will call you first. I've got a message for Monty Calbert. You had better see Natalie. - Who? Thank you. Let's have a drink. Anybody can drink. Let's dance. Can't anybody dance? - I can't. Who say so? - Marty. Oh? He doesn't let me dance with anyone else. Where is Marty? Upstairs. I'd like to talk to him, Natalie. I know you would. The bartender gave me the high sign to throw you out. I said no. Why? I like to dance. And you dance nice. Thank you. What do you want to see Marty about? Oh. I want to sell him an insurance policy. I like you. You are funny. Yeah? Mr Calbert. My name is Steve Keiver. The last time I made this speech I got pushed around. I will make it once more. I'm with an insurance company. Someone stole a car load of furs from Belrose. My company would give $10,000 to get those furs back. The deadline is tomorrow morning. No wonder you got pushed around. Look, I'm not saying you did the job. I don't care who it was. But it would be easy for you to find out who did it. You can make a deal with them. $10,000. No questions asked. I didn't send for you because I care about anything you had to say, Keiver. I just wanted to see what you looked like. The boys tell me Natalie thinks you are cute. I don't think so. Goodnight. You don't think I would have come here if I weren't on the level? Just don't let me catch you around here again. [ Telephone ] Yep? Yes. It's Keiver. Yeah. Yeah, I am listening. Well, hello Steve. Say, you're a bit early this morning, aren't you? Yes, sir. Mr Manston, I made a deal to get the Belrose furs back. What? How did you ..? You said $10,000 for the return of the furs, no questions asked. That's right. What is it .. Worth for the .. - For the man who makes the deal? Let's say $2,500. Fair enough. You get the furs back this morning. Sit down, Steve. Steve. What I said to you yesterday, I didn't mean you should .. Mr Manston, I haven't done anything wrong. I .. I don't know who pulled this job. I don't want to know. I see. But of course we'll be glad to get the furs back. And it probably seems like easy money to you. But don't forget what I said about the ladder. You do have a big future here. Yes, sir. They want the $10,000 in cash. - I know. Small bills. You see, I've had to deal with these men for years. What is happening? I don't know. They are a little late. Take it easy. That's the truck. Okay, men. Ten thousand. Twenty-five hundred. Be careful, Steve. - Don't worry. Take over, Harry. Ellen. We're giving away diamond rings today. Ellen. Ellen. Mr Keiver, what is all the commotion? Where's Miss Sayburn? She paid her rent and checked out early this morning. Are you sure? Why, yes. She and her husband. Didn't you know? She got married in Sun Valley. They left for Europe. Is there anything I can do for you? It's after 4 o'clock, sir. We are closing. Go ahead. Close. Well, celebrating? Sure. My girl just got married. Congratulations. You know it might have been you. I was wrong about you. You are smart. The boys tell me that was a nice, neat job. No fuss. You could be useful. I've got a job. Hey, let me have another. - Don't be a chump. Your girl leaves you for another guy. And you're so surprised that you got to come in here and get loaded. What did you expect her to do? Sit home and listen to you read the law books to her every night? Why don't you mind your own business? Oh, I have got lots of businesses. Keiver. If you're as smart as I think you are, you could make yourself a lot of money. The insurance company trusts you. Something gets misplaced and you can get it back for them. You get rich and .. You don't break laws. Think it over. Sober. I am a gambler. And gamblers don't take chances. [ Telephone ] Hello? Thanks. Excuse me. Hello? Yes. I can be there. What time? Tell Lieutenant O'Bannion I want to see him. I am sorry, Inspector. But as curator of the Dolini Art Galleries. I cannot authorise a time extension for the insurance company. The gallery wants those paintings recovered. So does the police department, Mr Perkins. A very commendable attitude I am sure, Inspector Duggan. But it hasn't brought our paintings back, has it? Look. We need a little more time. I'd like to cooperate with you gentlemen. But Mr Manston is prepared to see the paintings are returned within 24 hours. So you're going to make another deal with Steve Keiver, huh? I don't like that any better than you do, Inspector. But I am responsible to my stockholders. We are carrying insurance here for over $250,000. And if I can avoid paying off I am going to. Now, for $60,000 Keiver will guarantee that everything will be returned. But you don't have to pay anybody off. They can't sell those paintings. They are too well known. They wouldn't dare show them to anyone. That's beside the point. Al that interests me is that in 24 hours my company has to pay $250,000. On a theft policy. But you're playing right into their hands. I am sorry, Inspector. You will have your paintings back. How does Keiver know where they are? - That is none of my affair. Well it happens to be mine. Come on, O'Bannion. Yes. Mr Keiver can see you at 10:30 on Tuesday morning. Thank you for calling. I'd like to see Mr Keiver. - You're to go right in, Inspector. And you Lieutenant. - Thanks. Well gentlemen, how's things at the art gallery? Missing. Keiver, I dropped in to give you some friendly advice. Take a vacation. You're confusing yourself with my doctor. I've been around a long time but I haven't figured you out yet. You are a new type. That makes it interesting, Inspector. Why do you want to send me away? Because I think you are responsible for this crime wave. Now let me give you some advice. Don't ever walk into a lawyer's office and make accusations you can't prove. That is slander. You could end up without any retirement pay. I keep forgetting you are a lawyer. I'm in a legitimate business. I am hired to get back stolen goods. I don't know who the crooks are or want to know. No questions asked. Why don't you start asking yourself some questions? Keiver. Before you arrived, the larceny in this town was pretty tamped down. We had all the fences spotted. So the crooks had no safe place where they could peddle their wares. Now it is different. You can steal anything. Stuff they couldn't touch before. Famous paintings, jewelry. Very interesting. - And you know why? Because now they don't need fences anymore. They can make a deal with Steve Keiver. Without you they couldn't do it. - Inspector. Am I doing anything illegal? Legally, you are within your rights. Morally, you stink. How did you find out where the stolen paintings were? That's a leading question, like when did I stop beating my mother. Well, when did you? Where are the paintings now? Back at the gallery. That is where paintings belong. Don't you agree? Don't forget the theater opening tonight, Mr Keiver. It is an 8:15 curtain. - Thank you, Stella. Don't let me keep you. I have a feeling I'll be seeing a lot more of you. Any time you need legal advice .. - I'll get a lawyer. Say, what are you doing for dinner tonight? I think I am having it with you. That's right. - Here is my address. You don't waste a minute, do you. I will .. pick you up at 7 o'clock. [ Buzzer ] Come. Good evening, Miss Brenson. - Hello. Hi, darling. - Hi, Joan. Sorry I'm late. I had some extra work to do. It shows. You're just in time to catch a Martini. Lon. - Yes, sir. Aren't the Altons here yet? - They are not coming. Oh? Don't say "oh" like that. He got tied up. I see. Darling, I don't mind pleading guilty. Just tell me what it is I am guilty of. Have you seen the afternoon paper? - No. Flattering. You think so? You know what I like about you? Sure. I curve and I can cook. You never worry about me smearing your lipstick. It makes a man feel important. Joanie, why don't you give up your job and let me take care of you? I don't like the way you take care of yourself. The Altons are dull. - And you're very amusing, darling. But the Altons were afraid to come. What real friends can you have, Steve? The bank and I are buddies. I keep all my friends in the safe deposit box where they count. Look, darling. I am in a perfectly legitimate business. Don't fool yourself, Steve, You are dealing with criminals. Whether you ever see them or not isn't important. They know your name. They talk about you. You make deals for them. And you go around acting like you're in a business untouched by human hand. One day you are going to be in for a rude shock, my darling. Why do you stick around? - I don't know. Ego. Maybe I'd like to hear you say .. 'Will you marry me?' And would you? I don't think so. Maybe I'm sticking round because I think you are a haunted guy. Maybe I am .. waiting for the ghost to come back. Sorry. It is an 8:15 curtain. Maybe we'd better have a bite afterwards, huh? Here we are. Very dry. Well, here's to opening nights on Broadway. What did you think of the first act? - I loved it. She's such a wonderful actress. It looks like everybody turned out tonight. You know something? I think most of them came to look at each other. I have a feeling you are so right. How is my face? Someone should paint it. That is what I was afraid of. And if you will excuse me that is exactly what I am going to do. Oh. Don't talk to any strange girls. What was that poor baby darling wearing? I wouldn't give them to my maid. And did you notice all the wrinkles around her eyes? Sorry. Are you finished? Probably. Excuse me. Be quiet and no-one will get hurt. I want everyone over in this corner. I want your cash and jewelry. The faster we do this. The sooner you will get out of here. Anyone else? Hurry. Something wrong, officer? You think those signs are ornaments? I'm sorry. I'm waiting for my people who are leaving at the intermission. Well, you can't wait here. And next time don't park in the middle of 49th Street. Now get moving. Well, what is the matter with it? - You know these old buggies .. We'll be here for ten minutes. I don't want to hear a sound. Here's a squad car. Maybe they can give you a push. Now, there you are. Here come my people now. Good. Get the police. Quick! Help. Police! Sand back please and give her some air. Is she dead? - Not yet. Joanie. You have got a wonderful face. You alright? Fine. Except that my head feels like the target for tonight. No. Just lie there a while. I hear you tried to play cops and robbers. Break the crowd up. Keep them moving. Yes, sir. - No reporters. Walt. Put a man on the door. Nobody leaves. Right. Excuse me. Make this your checkpoint right here. Set up a couple of tables. Get all the names and addresses. - Right. Jimmy, give me a hand. Sorry. Excuse me please. Ladies, please. I am Inspector Duggan. Just a minute. Just a minute. I want to talk to you all but one at a time. I want everyone who was in here to remain in the theater. The rest of you give your names and addresses to the officers outside. And then you may leave. Thank you. What are you doing here? I had to powder my nose. Were you in here when it happened? - Inspector. Did you get a look them? - No. I did. I think even you can solve this one. You have 25 eyewitnesses. We'll see. If I can be of any service .. - No thanks. I don't think we'll need any help from you. Darling, you help the nice Inspector all you can. I'll be in the lobby. I'll wait outside. Me too. What was taken from you? A diamond bracelet, earrings and a necklace. Walt. I want a favor from you. That man. I want to know his name and address. Friend, we're not running a social .. - You want to solve this thing? What does he have to do with it? - Get his name and address. Thank you. - Excuse me. Just a minute, please. - Yes? I don't think we got your name and address. Just for the record. Oh. My name is Gordon Jessman. My wife and I are stopping at the Grenby Hotel. Suite 600. And incidentally, Mrs Jessman was wearing some very valuable jewelry. Will it be recovered? Sure it will, Mr Jessman. We'll be in touch with you. Thank you. Gordon Jessman. He and his wife are at the Grenby. Thanks. - Do we put a tail on him? I don't know. I think he looks pretty cute the way he is. Come back here, Keiver. Just what does he have to do with this robbery? It's obvious. Didn't you notice his chin? Very weak. - Ready, darling. Now listen, Keiver. I know it's a waste of breath but I will say it anyway. Will you kindly keep out of this. It's a pity you are a cop. You would have made such a good governess. One was a blond and one was a brunette. - Can you describe them? Well, they were very pretty. The blond was about 5 foot 3. Did her hair look bleached? I mean was it cheap and flashy looking? On no. It was natural blond hair. I am sure of that. That's right. - I agree with that. She was blond. This is as good a place as any. Here, give me the suitcase. Why didn't you invite the cop to get in the car with you? I told you. I was trying to get rid of him. I talked him out of a ticket. You dummy. I told Franko to send somebody else. Relax. You're jittery. I hope they got good descriptions of us. Burn the clothes and dump the car. We'll meet you later. Okay. I got them started in there. Thanks, Walt. - Go ahead, Mike. The Cosmic Auto rentals rented a car to a man at 4:10 yesterday afternoon. He left a hundred dollars cash deposit and a phony name and address. The driver's license is in the name of a man who had been dead about a year. What about the fingerprints? - We're checking them now. It don't look good. Right. Keep on it. These are the composites, Inspector. They're pretty good-looking girls. Have the witnesses seen them? - 25 witnesses drew them. Sergeant. Put these on telephoto right away. All points. Yes, sir. Inspector Duggan. Okay, we'll be right in. They are ready for us, Walt. Now, will you take your coats and hats off please. I never thought I'd get tired of looking at beautiful women. Look, if there is anything I can do .. You stick to Keiver. Who is on him now? - Eddie and Howard are tailing him. What about that chauffeur. Got anything on him? No, nothing yet. The cop that let him get away says he can identify him if we find him. If we don't find him that cop can take his horse, go west and become a cowboy. That one looks a little like the blond. - Which one? Number 4. Will you step forward please? Any of you other ladies think that number 4 looks like the blond? I am sure that is the one. I'd know her any place. That is the blond alright. - I remember the eyes. Alright. Thanks very much. That's all. Let 'em go. File out please. Thanks very much ladies for coming in. We'll call you again when we have some more suspects. Hey, what about that blond? She happens to be one of our new police matrons. Want to have some fun? Let's go out and spend the afternoon pinching motorists. Why didn't that Keiver decide to be a doctor? You know, they'd never dare to pull a stunt like this .. Unless they knew they can turn it back to him. It's too hot for anyone to sell. Well, he is not going to get away with it this time. Walt. I want you to stick to him like flypaper. Hang on to him day and night. Smother him. I want every shady character that he talks to picked up. We've got to scare him away. If we can keep him from completing this deal he's through. They'll never trust him again. - Just leave him to me. [ Buzzer ] Steve. Steve. It is good to see you. How did you find me? That was easy. The hard part was coming here. I'm glad you came. So am I. You are even more beautiful. Am I? Gordon must be good to you. Yes. He has been wonderful. How was Europe? Fine. It must be a good place for a honeymoon. Yes. We went to Paris. We would have gone to Atlantic City. I am sorry, Steve. I was a little upset when you left. You forgot to kiss me goodbye. Why did you come here? To do this. Steve, darling. You mean 'Gordon, darling', don't you? What was it in France, 'Pierre, darling'? Steve. What did you expect, medals? You are not talking to the sucker you left. Oh no. I took your advice. I went out and got a liberal education. Some things they don't teach you in law school. Like how to buy a penthouse. But you were a great teacher and I have graduated. I can afford to send Stevie to Oxford. Only there isn't any Stevie. Isn't there anything I can say? Not a thing, baby. Not at thing except goodbye. You see, I am too smart to stick around .. Because I'm still sucker enough to be in love with you. I'm glad, Steve. Save it, save it. You love Gordon. You are wrong. I married Gordon for his money. Well, that's honest anyway. I wasn't dishonest with Gordon. I told him I didn't love him before I married him. I was dishonest with myself. Nice, you found that out when you were rich. I guess I deserved that. I am afraid I don't make a very good fortune hunter. I don't want it. So, I am giving Gordon back his fortune. I .. I didn't know how to tell you I was married, Steve. I tried to that day at the airport. I just couldn't. I knew then how much I really loved you. It was too late. Oh Steve. There has never been anyone but you. What about Gordon? I can go to Mexico. - Good. That's quick. You know something. I am awfully glad I came by. If you hadn't I'd have haunted you. Is there something wrong, Steve? Nothing. I just remembered something I have to do. I'll be waiting. I'll call you later. Wait inside. I'll get him. Where's the boss? - Down there. You know how long he's been under? Four and a half minutes. - Wow. You know what the world's record is? Six minutes 29 and 4/5ths seconds. A Frenchman by the name of Palguine did it in 1912. Here he comes. Four forty-one. Did you hear that? Maybe I can do the Olympics, huh? Steve Franko at the Olympics. That would be something, huh. Yeah, Franko. Floyd and Roger are here. I said not to let them come round here. - I know, Tell them. I don't want no trouble with them. They are nervous kids. Come on. I'll get dressed. Hello boys. Sorry to keep you waiting. What is on your minds? Money, Mr Franko. It is time we were paid off. Sure. I gave you and advance. I'll give you more. How much do you want? All of it. Look boys, use your heads. These jewels are too hot to be fenced. - What do we do, wear them? The companies can't hold out much longer. They'll make a deal with Steve Keiver. Trust me. Sure. We trust you. Don't disappoint us. This will hold you over for a while. Keep in touch with me. I might be needing you. Any time you boys want to go swimming downstairs don't hesitate to .. Those punks. I wish this was over. I'd like to go away. I think maybe we'll take a trip to the Riviera. Have you ever seen pictures of the Mediterranean? Blue and clear. Great to swim in. You must have come from a family of fish. Hello Joan. I'm sorry I am late. - Exactly 3 minutes. I fixed you a nice pizza to start with, Mr Keiver. That sounds fine. Well, this is like old times. I haven't seen much of you lately. Been pretty busy. - That's what I said to myself. I said: 'Steve is pretty busy'. How are things at the office? Oh. Just one constant vacation. Want to come back? We can us a good lawyer. I'm afraid not. Joan, I .. - Alright. Alright. You have told me. Now, may we have lunch? I am starved. But you don't even know what .. - Yes. Yes I do, Steve. I didn't know exactly when my walking papers would be notarized, but .. I knew they were being drawn up. You are a very remarkable girl. Just so you that remember I am a girl. - I wish it weren't like this. Smart girls don't hang around haunted houses. Your ghost came back, didn't she? I'm sorry. - For me? Please don't be. I am luckier than most people. I got what I wanted for a little while. I wouldn't give back a minute of it. I .. I just hope she knows how lucky she is. I had better be careful. I'll be .. Sending you back to her with a swollen head. You'll be impossible. Joan. - I love this place. This is where we had our first date. Remember? Yeah. Don't bring her here. I am sorry, darling. I was wrong. I guess I am not very hungry after all. Taxi, mister? Want me to lose him? - No. Drive slowly. Head toward my apartment. Okay. Keep away from the back window. How does it feel to hitch your wagon to a racket, Steve? I get a nice cool breeze. Part of that breeze has been blowing a lot of gold dust your way. Yes, I know. You have saved my company a good deal of money. But I don't think it's been worth it, Steve. I should have stopped you. - Let's skip the sentiment, huh. What is the deal? I am acting as spokesman for all the companies involved. The total insurable loss in the theater holdup amounts to $860,000. We are willing to pay $200,000 for the return of the jewelry. Here is an itemised list. Your fee will be $50,000. This reads like a who's-who. What is the time limit? - We've only 48 hours left. We were hoping we wouldn't have to make a deal. I'll bet. This doesn't give me much time. It's going to cost you more. How much more? Oh, let's say a $100,000 for my share and $225,000 for the jewels. That's a lot, Steve. That's why I want it. - They won't stand for it. They'll have to. I'm saving you over $500,000. Take it or leave it. I have no choice. It's a deal. Drop him, Harry. Excuse me a minute, Ellen. Lefty, how would you like to get in on a sure thing? I've got bad news for you, Mr Keiver. You've been scratched. The cops have been picking up everybody you talk to. The boys want you to leave them alone. Oh, Lefty. Okay, Andy. Take him away. Let's go. Hello Natalie. Where is Marty? - Leave him alone. The word is out. You are poison. Do me a favor and don't .. I've been expecting you. I could use a drink. - You won't be here long enough. What's the matter? If you're worried about O'Bannion, I've lost him. I know it. He is busy questioning Natalie. No. I am not worried about O'Bannion. I am worried about you. I keep thinking maybe your publicity might get you in the obituary columns. Maybe I could help. Now listen, Calbert. - You listen, big man. Every time you get your picture in the paper the police close up another joint. My boys are getting hurt. They don't like you, Keiver. And neither do I. Thanks. I won't enter any popularity contests. Any luck with Calbert? Why don't you let him come to you, like you did before? There isn't time. Got to make this deal fast. It is a honeymoon present. Congratulations. That's great. Thanks, Harry. Harry, what is the fare for this week? Let me see. Forty-three dollars and 20 cents. Thanks, Steve. I didn't see you get in. Where to? You take a good picture, Harry. Yeah. That's a good name. Harry Dycker. You didn't tell me where you want to go. You are going to take a message to Garcia, Harry. Who? Don't fret, Harry. It's an educated joke and you are probably illiterate. Look mister, I don't have to .. - Shut up and pay attention, Harry. When we reach the next corner I am getting out. I want you to deliver this message to your Mr Steven Keiver. Now don't let anything go wrong, Harry. I bought these for your little girl, Harry. For her birthday party tomorrow. Is everything alright, Miss Brenson? A perfect delight. Got a nickel? Yes, Miss Brenson. Gracias. [ Music ] [ Singing: ] "I've got you .." "Deep in the heart of me." "So deep in my heart .." "That you are really a part of me." Miss Brenson. I've been looking .. - Hello, Harry. You are just in time for the party. Come on over and have a little drink. No thank you. - Sit down. Sit down. Will you have some champagne? - No. I'm sorry to bother you like this. - It is no bother. I'm just having a little party for myself. It is sort-of an anniversary party. In reverse. At Steve's place. I have a message for Steve. But I can't get near him. Has something happened to Steve? - Oh no, ma'am. It is just that they are watching him too close. But you could get to him. The cops wouldn't bother you. You shouldn't have come here, Harry. I didn't know what else to do. When he told me about you going on a honeymoon and everything. I figured you was the one to come to. Honeymoon? If the cops ever got hold of this he'd be cooked. What is the message? Tell him it is set for tonight. But he has got to come himself. They'll be waiting for him at .. Miss Brenson. - Evening, Lon. We've missed you. - Thank you, Lon. I've been farmed out. Is he alone? Ask a foolish question. Lon, who was it? - I was. Hello, Steve. Hello Joan. This is a pleasant surprise. I know. Your cup is running over. I'll only be a minute. I've got to get back to an anniversary party. Have her come in, Steve. Would you like to meet Ellen? Oh, goody. Ellen this is .. Mrs Brenson. Mrs Jessman. Hello. I'm glad we can finally meet. I have a chance to .. to thank you. For what? Keeping him warm for you? Sorry. I shall .. Wash my mouth out with a Scotch and soda. Here is to .. honeymoons. Steve forgot to mention that he knows weddings make me cry. Harry sent a message. It is tonight. Where? Did he say where? 720 East 18th Street. Nine o'clock. And you are to come alone. They won't talk to anybody else. They know I won't do that. - Honeymoons are expensive. I'll bet she wears black lace. Oh. Oh. Harry says to be in the lobby at exactly ten minutes after eight. Don't bother. I will throw myself out. I had better go. - Steve. You won't let anything happen to you, will you. Of course not. Please be careful. - I will. I am a sucker for black lace. How long has she been up there? - About five minutes. Here she comes. I'll take you home, Miss Brenson. - What? Okay, Bill. How are you, Robbie? Fine, Mr Keiver. Something is going on around here. Cops are all over the place. Really? - Yes, sir. Just wait a minute, huh. I'm expecting a friend. Look at that crazy fool. He's going to get killed. His cab is out of control. Are you alright? - Yeah. My steering rack broke. Come on. We'd better get back. That's all, Frank. Thanks. Good evening. My name is Franko. Someone should have told you Mr Franko that I don't handle these things myself. You are here. Sit down. Thanks. These are my associates. We have a big investment, Steve. I like to know who I am dealing with. So do I. Who actually pulled the job? The girls? They left town. - I don't think so. I think they are right here. I told you that the girls .. - Try again Franko. There were no girls. Beautiful girls are too easy to spot. Somebody played it cosy. Ten to one you're from Burlesque. Female impersonators. Vaudeville, Me Keiver. We are artists. Poor Duggan. Suppose we get down to business. They'll pay $225,000. You haven't much time left. I don't like haggling. We'll take it. When do you want the jewels? You are nice to do business with. Have you got them here? - I'm not that nice to do business with. I'll get them to you tonight. - When do we get the money? Tomorrow. - Tonight. Tomorrow is okay. Mr Keiver has got a reputation like Linchpin. He'd have been flattered. You can have the package delivered to my apartment at 11 o'clock. Fine. [ Banging noise ] It's just the wind. Sure. Or a tourist. How do we know you didn't plant someone outside? Stick to your dancing, Nijinsky. Hello, Inspector. Forgive my calling you so late but I had to congratulate you. "The jewels were recovered by the police department." When? In about an hour. - "Listen, Keiver." As for the press is concerned. You and your department did the job with your own little bare hands. "I don't want anything for it." - But where are the jewels now? The jewels will be delivered to my apartment at 11 o'clock. I'd like O'Bannion to be there a few minutes earlier. "If I ever get a parking ticket I'll call you." Now listen, Keiver. Keiver. You're early. Remind me to get my watch fixed. Look, why did you call us in on this? It might be nice to take some of the heat off you. And off yourself. - Real smart. The thing that you and Duggan can't get through your head, O'Bannion .. Is that I am not a crook. I just make your job simpler. Don't, Keiver. I cry easily. [ Bell ] I have a feeling that is a million-dollar ring. Just stay right where you are. A package for Steven Keiver. - Come on in. Let me see your identification. All I said was I got a package for .. Where did you get this? A man came in. He gave me five dollars to deliver it. And the manager told me to go ahead. Did you get a good look at him? Sure. - Could you identify him? I don't think so. What do you mean, you don't think so? He was Chinese. They all kind-of look alike. Alright. That's all. - Yes, sir. Well anyway, you recovered the jewels. Yes. Now we'll have a look. A million dollars. I'd better call Duggan, I don't want to be responsible for taking care of .. [ Gunshot! ] [ Telephone ] "Hello? Is Lieutenant O'Bannion there?" "Hello .. hello .. hello?" [ Door knocks ] Open up in there. What's happened? I heard a shot. Lieutenant. Lieutenant! [ Door knocks ] He must still be in there. Open up in there. Lieutenant. Lieutenant! Attention all units. Be on the lookout for Steven Keiver. Wanted for murder. He is armed. Description 6 feet 3 inches. Hey, Joe. You're wanted. Come on out here. What are you doing here? What's happened? - I want those jewels. What you trying to pull? I sent them to you. On a yo-yo string. They were hijacked. Those jewels were delivered. I watched them. Maybe you came up to the apartment to get a better look? You're a liar. - Cut it out. Keep talking. This was an inside job. Nobody knew about the delivery but the police and your boys. And your cabdriver friend. That is right. You can't get away with it, Keiver. There isn't a crook in town who would hijack you. You're the man who always make a deal with them. They'd kill to protect you. They did kill. There's a dead cop in my apartment. The only chance I have to clear myself is to get the man who did it. That is too bad. Because you are washed up. No insurance company would go near you now. If the police got you they'd want to know a lot of things. Things about us. And we wouldn't want that to happen would we. Look, I'd never talk. - I am going to see to it. I hate to do this because I like you. But you might be bad for my business. Take him down to the basement. Come along, Steve. This way. Joe! Who called me? Son of a gun. Where have you been Joey-boy? Kermit, I want you to meet my good old friend and pal .. Hey, what's your name? - Brown. Phil Brown. Are you R.O.C.B? - Am I R.O.C.B? You must be really loaded. I just lost my badge. Here. Take mine. Listen. We're all going down to have a drink. How about it, huh? Say, I was just telling my good friend Phil Brown .. Where did he go? He was here a minute ago. Let's go and get a drink. Come on. He won't get far. You idiots. How did you lose him? What do you expect me to do, shoot him here? Spread the word to the boys. I don't want him picked up alive. Hey, what do you think you're doing? Having fun in the greatest little town in the world. On a convention, huh? Well, you sure look it. I left the little old lady at home. Well, you had better get back to your chums and keep out of trouble. I'll have a little drink for you. Alan speaking. Just spotted Steve Keiver. He's on 18th Street heading west on foot. Attention all units in vicinity of 18th Street. Steve Keiver reported heading west on foot. Proceed with caution. Taxi! [ Radio: ] "All radio stations have been requested to broadcast an hourly description." "Here again is the description of Steven Keiver." Gotham Village. Keep it. Steve. Come in. The wife and kid are asleep. I was afraid they might have gotten you. No. They didn't get me, Harry. It's a shame, isn't it. How does it feel to have a million dollars? What are you talking about? You don't think I double-crossed you? It was easy. You knew where I was going. You were by the window at the ballet school .. As we made plans to send the jewels to my apartment. After that, the rest was a cinch but you didn't get out of town fast enough. Steve. I'm just a hackie. That is nothing to put on my tombstone but this is. I never double-crossed anyone in my life. I'm sending the wife and kid out of town in the morning. You had better pull yourself together. I'm sorry, Harry. I had to find out. Forget it. Who else knew about it? Joan .. and .. Ellen. You can forget about them. Let's not. What is the address across the street? 1820 Bigelow. 1820 Bigelow. Hello Joan? No. I am alright. Listen. Can you meet me? Good. In an hour. I am at 1820 Bigelow. I knew I could count on you. You had better be careful, Steve. Don't worry. Mrs Ellen Jessman please. Ellen. Hello darling. I know. No. I am alright. I am at 1820 Bigelow. Can you meet me in an hour? Thanks. We'll know in an hour. Maybe sooner. Yes? Well, that is good. Keep right on it. Right. A traffic officer spotted him on 32nd and Lexington. He was wearing these and got away. 'R.O.C.B.' What does that stand for? You got me. - Sergeant. Get a list of all the conventions in town and find out where they're staying. Right. We've had seven reports on him so far. Two of these sound good. Inspector. Inspector. Grab the phone. It's hot. Inspector Duggan. What? Yes, Miss? Yes. I understand. Of course you will be protected. What is the address? Don't worry. We'll get him. Communications. Signal 32. Instruct Car 1 to proceed to 19th and Bigelow. Car 6 to proceed to 18th and Bigelow. Proceed quietly. Eddie, get the car. - Right. Here. Drink this. You will feel better. - Thanks, Harry. You were right. It took her only fifteen minutes. Any luck? - Not a thing. We've searched every apartment in the building, Inspector. It must have been a false alarm. - Nothing, huh? You want us to go through some of the other buildings? No. It would take you a week. He might be any place. Send the units back. Come on. Harry. Thanks for the coffee. Sure. Where you going? I have a date. Ellen. Joan? Steve. Steve. Are you alright? No. No. I have been all wrong. Thanks for coming. Give yourself up, Steve. There's something I must take care of first. They'll kill you. - That will be a small loss. Not to me. I'll get back to you. [ Buzzer ] There's the bellboy, darling. You ready? - In a minute. We're looking for Steve Keiver. - Who? Steve Keiver. Mrs Jessman knows who we mean. - Ellen. He's a great friend of hers. I hope I haven't caused any trouble, Mrs Jessman. Not here. Maybe we had better wait. I've a feeling he might show up. I want to talk to you. If you will excuse us. What are you doing? We're going to make a deal with Franko. - I don't like this. Franko will like it. - Ellen, are you sure? Shooting that detective was your idea. Are you coming? Did you have a nice little talk? Yes. And now we'll all have a nice little talk with Franko. Stick with that car ahead. Who told you to bring them here? - I have the jewels. Sit down. Where did you get them? I found them. - Keiver is an old bull of hers. And you saw a chance to knife him and get rich? You are a real cute babe. You hijacked the jewels and framed Keiver in a murder rap. I don't admit a thing. You don't have to. You stepped out of your league. You have guts but you have no brains. We can always take the jewels somewhere else. Where are they? Safe. How much are they worth to you? How much are they worth to you? What do you mean? I don't think I am going to have to pay anything for them, Mrs Jessman. You have got the jewels. I've got you. If anything happens to me you will never find those jewels. You're smart. But you made one big mistake. I never went to Vassar. I'm afraid you are dealing with dirty people. When we are through with you will beg to tell us where those jewels are. Take her down to the boiler room. No-one will hear her down there. Inspector Duggan. "Duggan?" Keiver? Trace the call on 2. Duggan, I need your help. I know who killed O'Bannion. I haven't got much time. Meet me at .. That's right, Steve. You haven't got much time. Keiver? Hello? Right. Right. It's in the Butterfield exchange district. He disconnected too fast to get the number. I checked 72 conventions. The ROCB is the 'Royal Order of Civic Boosters'. At the Chandler Hotel. - Isn't that Franko's place? Yeah. What telephone exchange district is that in? I think it is Butterfield. - I think so too. Come on. No, no! Gordon! Gordon, help me! - Gordon can't help you. When we're through, Gordon won't want help you. You're not going to be very pretty. - No! Stop it! Stop it. I'll tell you. No! No. Now you're being smart. What did you do with them? They're in our trunk at the hotel. - Better be the truth. Ellen! [ Gunshot! ] Ellen! Let's go. We got company. We are making you a permanent guest here. You don't want me. You want Gordon Jessman. He killed O'Bannion. He hijacked the jewels. Now, why would he want to do that? Maybe his wife got too expensive. Where is Jessman? [ Gunshot! ] Keiver. - Never mind that now. Get back to Jessman's apartment and get that package. The cops! - Franko is down there. Come on, boys. Come on. Get Keiver. He is coming around. He is going to be alright? He has got a lot to answer for. 0ne of my men was killed. - But Steve didn't do it. An accessory. It's funny. The smart ones always trip themselves up. You've waited for him a long time, haven't you. He's worth waiting for. He is all yours, Inspector. Steve. I told you I'd get back to you. Sorry, lady. It's alright. She's with him. ..r.?.s..
