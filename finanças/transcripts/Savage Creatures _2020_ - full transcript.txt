For the life of the flesh is in the blood and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for our souls for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul. Having therefore these promises let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God. Father, Creator of the universe and all life within, we praise you for the nourishment that you provide. Thank you for meeting our physical needs of hunger and thirst. Forgive us for taking that simple joy for granted and bless this food to fuel our bodies forward into your will for our lives. We pray that we will be energized and be able to work for the glory of your kingdom. In Jesus name, Amen. A nationwide flurry of mysterious falling meteors have alarmed experts and scientists who have declared the event as an unusual phenomenon. The National Weather Service issued a statement saying, after reviewing several observational datasets, the NWS can confirm that the flashes and booms heard by residents across the states were not thunder or lightning, but instead, crashing meteors. We continue to monitor feeds from astronomical agencies for an official explanation for this wave of cosmic objects to determine if there's any threat or danger to civilians. - Phew! - Oh! These are just a few videos captured by shaken residents over the last 24 hours. You want God to work in your situation? Open the door! Open the door to your soul and spirit and let Jesus inside! Let Jesus inside! To resist the Glory of our savior into your hearts is to sentence your living soul to eternal damnation. Do you want to know why? Because each and every one of us is born into this world with an unholy, evil savage creature within and it possesses your minds and your spirits. That's why there's so much malevolence, torment, barbarism and debauchery in our world today! The savage creature within all of us must be purged or we are doomed to burn in the eternal flame. My brothers and sisters, the End of Days are upon us, there is no more time to dilly dally on this subject, you must take Jesus into your hearts so all of us can ascend to the Kingdom of God. Hello, ladies! Are you in need of a ride somewhere? Would it be any trouble? Not at all. Climb on in. I'm Liz and this is my son Darby. Nice to meet you Liz and Darby, I'm Rose and this is my good friend Ursula. And so, where are you headed? As far west as you can take us, that would be appreciated. Well, we can take you to Cedar City, we live just a few miles south of there. That would be just fine, actually. Thanks, Liz. Not to pry, but when's the last time the two of you had a warm bath and a hot meal? Longer than we care to say? How about you come home with us, get cleaned up, have a quick bite then Darby will take you to the edge of town. Sound good? We can't impose. It's no imposition. As a matter in fact, I insist. It'd be nice to have a little company for a while. You can set your bags on the bench there if you like. Nice. Been our home for almost 25 years. I can take your coats and hats. What would you ladies like to eat? We actually just ate a little while ago, so please don't trouble yourself, we appreciate it though. You sure? Yeah, I'm still really full, but thank you anyway. Okay. Well, enjoy your showers. We have two showers upstairs. Follow me. So this is the first bathroom. Oh, cool! - I'll take this one. - All right. You want to take a shower, you just turn the water on and bring that lever down. Great. Do you want one or two towels? One, please. There you go. - Thank you. - Enjoy. We will go around, down the hall. Here's the shower, towels are there. Thanks, Darby. Take your time. The Lord has been so kind to us! Neither one of them seems to even have a cell phone, imagine that! Disconnected from the world. Oh! Though they are a little thin for my taste, but there's enough meat on those bones to tide us over a good while. Okay, I didn't find anything but I think we should get out of here. Yeah, I got the same vibe. But look what I found. That's perfect. Just let me shut this. How do you want to do it? First I'll um, try to get them to stay the night. And if they refuse, then we have to separate them. Since they're not eating anything, we'll have to do it the old fashioned way. Get them from behind. I'm doubling the dosage, they'll be out in a snap. Well look at you two! Absolute visions of beauty! Thanks again for everything, Liz, but we really need to be getting back on the road because it's going to be getting dark pretty soon. Well, you know you're welcome to stay the night, we can take you first thing in the morning. Oh, thank you, we really do appreciate that, but we would like to be on our way now. Well, I'm a little disappointed, I was hoping that you'd stay a while longer, it would have been nice to get to know you better. But, hey, I understand. I'll get your coats. You have to excuse my Mom, we don't get many visitors here, she gets a little lonesome. Not to mention my sister left a couple years ago, she took it really hard. I understand. These hats have seen better days! Darby has a whole lot of extra caps, can we at least offer you replacements? Oh, well Darby, take Ursula, let her pick out a couple. I'll stay here with Rose. Follow me. Liz, thank you again so much for everything. You're very welcome. Uh, Darby mentioned that you had a daughter as well? Yes. Lily. She was very special to me. Was? Did something happen to her? She passed away. I'm sorry. Darby had mentioned that she left home? Figuratively, yes. She left our world two years ago. It was horrible how she died. Here you go. Take your pick. She wasn't well in the head. Doctors, psychiatrists, advanced treatments, nothing could help her. What happened to her? She Took her own life. It is the greatest mortal sin, in God's eyes, you know, suicide. Her soul has been forever damned. Not a moment goes by I don't think of her and where she's at right now her soul burning alive in the eternal flame. Fucking bitch! What the fuck did you just do? I should fucking kill you! I should kill you! What did you do to me you fucking bitch? Do you have this, Darby? I need to go into town. What for? Cleaning supplies, we're out. This was unexpected. Okay. Great. What? Who are you? You mean, what are we? I didn't realize how hungry I was, I feel so much better. So, how do you feel after being chopped up with an axe? Hey let me tell you, that fucking hurt like hell. Oh, I know all about it April uprising, remember? Yeah. Bulgaria. 18 something? April of 1876. We were in Bratsigovo. Oh yeah, yeah, you got speared Right through the damned back. Those crazy fucking Ottomans. Still have a little scar from that. So now what? Psycho bitch will be back soon, and we have to take care of him. Yeah, he's going to turn in a minute. Yeah. I'll get the bags. Okay. Here. This time, don't hit my fucking hand. Would you let it go? Should we move him out? No, I want crazy bitch to see this when she gets back. Sounds good. Darby? Darby! Why aren't you answering me? Darby? Darby. Oh my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! How? It isn't possible You know it's really fucked up what you did, Liz. I actually kind of liked you. We were just goin to rummage through your house, take what we needed and go. Demons! We were going to let you live. But no... - Demons! - You messed it all up. And I really don't like to kill women, but you're no woman at all, you're more monster than me. My turn. Stupid ass bitch. This would look perfect on you. Oh! All right, so what do we do with the bodies? There's a freezer out in the garage I really do not feel like dragging them out there, Rose, it's been a really long day. Mmmm you're right, I'm beat. There's a closet over there, we can just shove them in. Now you're talking. Cannibals? Cannibals. They were going to eat us. Fucking cannibals. Hi, I'm Darby! Oh my stomach is... I'm not blaming you, Ursula, we both fucked up. It was easy for these yokels to take us down. It's embarrassing. How did we let this happen? Maybe we're just tired. No. No, we're not tired. We're lazy. And careless. We used to sense that shit a mile away. We cannot let this happen again. I know. But you have to admit the senses have dulled a lot over that last few decades. I do. And I'll tell you why. Why? It's the blood. It's poison. Because everybody in the 21st century is jacked up on opiates, heroin, crack cocaine, methamphetamines, and so on and so on. It's pure poison. And we, my love? We've been feeding on it. And this? Is the purest blood we've had in years. And I'll tell you why. Regardless of how crazy these sick, twisted fucks were, they kept their bodies clean. This is like the old turn of the 20th century stuff. And it's goddamned euphoric. I miss those days, Rose. I really do. It was so easy. Before science and technology kicked our asses. The surveillance cameras and motion detectors and satellites and GPS. And forensics. And now everybody has a fucking video camera in their phones. How is a vampire supposed to survive in this day and age, I ask you? Small towns. Homeless shelters and the derelict. Mmm. But it's all trash. We had it so good back then. The wealthy, elite the opulence and the extravagance the blood was transcendent. Now look at us. Fucking vagabonds. Feeding on cannibal blood. Pathetic. We're pathetic. What's going to happen to us, Rose? We keep forging ahead. Meet each new challenge as they come, regardless of how fucked up they may be, like today for example. And hope that my prayer is answered. Which is? A global power grid shutdown, plunging humanity back into the Dark Ages. Then, and only then will we truly be free. And is that your birthday wish? Birthday wish? The night just passed. It is now December the 23rd. It's my fucking birthday? 426 years old. And still looking good. You ready for your present? Absolutely. Well that's a new look for you. What time is it? Almost five. You slept all day, how was it? Great, except for all of the crazy dreams. Bloody Mary? Absolutely. So we've got a problem. Which is? The latest of the National News Service is that waves of falling meteors have increased in numbers across the nation. Added to that are hundreds of witness accounts describing living organisms hatching from within the crashed meteor debris, wait, do we have him live? okay, put him through, field reporter Stan Weston is coming to us live from a crashed meteor site in Andalusia County. Stan, can you describe what you're seeing? Rick the meteor crash site I'm standing next to is about 11 minutes fresh, the meteor is in a cauterized crater, about feet feet in diameter. the meteor's surface is charcoal black, ovular in shape. An eerie green mist is emanating from the meteor's base. Whoa, wait, wait, wait. Rick, the meteor just cracked open like an egg. A milky white fluid is oozing out, Everyone stand back, get back, get back! There could be radiation! What I'm seeing now are two tentacles. Rick, this is clearly an extra terrestrial life-form. Seeing more of the organism. It's pushing itself out of the shell. People, stand back! I've never seen anything like this. it appears to be a fleshy life-form, shaped like a sea creature. a manta ray comes to mind. Oh, my God. it's levitating. it's rising up, it's coming out. Everyone get back! It's coming toward me, it's getting closer! Oh, my God ladies and gentlemen, we strongly urge every one of you to take shelter. Avoid the meteor crash sites at all costs. Military and the National Guard have been dispatched to all counties. This can't be happening. Remember that wish you made last night? For a power grid shutdown? Yeah. Not a fucking alien invasion! Lock yourselves in your homes, do not venture outside until help arrives. Ladies and gentlemen, we're getting more witness accounts of victims attacked by these alien creatures. it seems once bitten by the organism, the victim transmutes from a lifeless state into a rabid, manic predator. who then attacks at random. the threat to us all is now two-fold. Wow. They've entered the station! Seal off the exits, barricade the doors! No, run! Still wanna bury Liz and Darby? If this is real, which I need to see with my own fucking eyes, then I don't see the point! I say let's get the hell out of here. All right, let's do it. We'll take the van, grab the keys, I'll get the bags. Oh and Liz had a gun, see if there are more of them and ammo too. I've gotta see this for myself, I want to know what we're dealing with. What the hell is that? Let's get out of here, huh? What the fuck was that? What happened? Ow, she fucking bit me! Ursula? Ursula? Ursula? What is? Just kidding. Jesus fucking Christ that wasn't funny! See? All gone. Ok. So these zombies, or whatever they are, can't hurt us, but we can kill them. Just shoot them in the head. And those creatures? Hopefully, we don't find out. Rose, this is bad. We're looking at the actual end of everything. Or a new beginning. Too many fucking bad people in this world. They've had it coming. The penance is long overdue. Jesus fucking Christ. Just when I thought the day couldn't get any stranger. Oh, God thanks for saving our lives. I'm Father Cooper. That's Sister Gigi. She's a mute. Oh, Lord! Liz and Darby, are they here? No, they left a while ago. Well their van is in the carport. They went for a while a few hours ago and we haven't seen them since. And who might you be? How do you know the Grangers? We were just hitchhiking through town and they picked us up. Real nice couple, they let us stay the night and everything. We were supposed to leave this afternoon but then all of this happened. Yeah I'm starting to get real worried. Yeah, we've been concerned, haven't we? Yeah, I hope nothing's happened to them. They're real fine people. More than that, they're the most saintly, God fearing citizens in our community. I fear the worst. So. You know how to kill them. Yeah. Shoot them in the fucking head. More than that. You've got to hit them in the pineal gland otherwise they'll keep coming for you. Pineal Gland? As far back as the second century, the pineal was believed to be the home of the soul and served as a conduit between humans and God. It produces the DMTs, the spirit molecule. That's why they attack us. They're trying to get back that which was extracted from their bodies. You see, the celestial creatures that have invaded our world are soul takers. When they strike, they feed upon the eternal spirit and consume it. So all of this just happened and suddenly you're the expert? Well we've known about these things since 79 AD. The book of Revelations it was. And God's children came out before him and they knelt down and spoke in a loud voice, Oh Sovereign Lord, holy and true, when will thou judge and avenge those who blood against the earth? I've been warning people about these things for a very long time. But no one listens. No one heeds my warning. And now Hell's bowels have released and Satan's army has come forth upon the Earth. And it will attack and destroy all, we are doomed! From below, from within and from above. So we know how to stop the zombies, how do we kill these creatures? It's unknown. It's God's cunning design, so there's nowhere on Earth that we can run or hide or get away. Nowhere. Nowhere to go. Oh, Lord, pardon us if we've done any evil. Please protect us. If we've done any good then deign to accept it. Oh, Lord, protect us as we take our rest, Lord. Safe sleep, Lord. We don't want anything to happen while we're sleeping. May God protect you and love you in gathering. Please kiss the cross, it will protect you! We're going to have to take a hard pass on that, Father. The holy water the holy water I command you, unclean spirits, - along with all your minions... - oh for fuck's sake. Now attacking servants of God, by the mysteries of the incarnation, passion, resurrection, and ascension of our Lord Jesus Christ, by the descent of the Holy Spirit, by the coming of our Lord for judgment, that you tell me by some sign of your name, and the day. Oh, my God. Oh, God! What have you done? Listen, there's something you should know about your friends. And what might that be? Take a look in the freezer and find out. No, I don't think so. Your model citizens were cannibals. The freezer's full of human flesh and body parts. Go see for yourself. I'll not have you defile their character with your lies. I know what's going on here, I think I do, I think so. You avoided the crucifix. You moved away from the holy water. Bite marks on the neck. Spikes in the chest. You're feminists! Both of you! Look, I don't know where you're from, but I suggest you go back to it. You're not welcome here. You've got a bad vibe. There's a dark energy, it's unclean, unholy, undead, feeding off the live blood of the living, you're demonic evils, you're evil demons, you're vampires! Drive you out, drive you out unclean spirits, demonic powers, all sects, drive you out by the power of God, God the father commands you, God the son commands you, God the holy ghost commands you to come out! Come on, let's go! It burns! Oh, shit! As far back as the second century, the pineal was believed to be the home of the soul and served as a conduit between humans and God. Is the van clear? The van is clear, but there about 10 of those things in the front yard. No problem, let's go. Damn. I kinda liked her. Oh. So you liked her. She was good at keeping her mouth shut. You ready to do this? Do you even know which direction we're going? Do I look like a fucking compass? West, I guess. Go that way. Shit. We're out of gas. I am not liking this. Where'd you get that? Stole it from the cannibals. Always planning ahead, that's what I love about ya. Mother Lilith, it stinks in here. It's fresh. Holy shit it's one of those things. It's dead. Are you sure? I'm sure. Let's get some light in here. Ursula, that is foul. Well if you don't like it go sit somewhere else. Gladly. Wow. Find something? Oh, yeah. You should see this. No, thanks. Looks like a parietal lobe and here a frontal lobe. Motor cortex. The fuck does that mean? It's the creature's brain but wait, look at these. These appear to be atrias and these are ventricles. And that means what? This organ is an all in one brain and heart. That's why it died, somebody got a lucky shot in with this arrow. So we know how to kill them. Well, like zombies and vampires, shoot them in the brain and stake them through the heart. Well ain't that peachy. Makes them easier to kill. I'll say. We'll clean that, probably need it later. Ow! What? I don't know, it feels like a bug bite. - Hey. - Ursula? What's wrong? Ursula. Rose. Rose. Hey, hey, Rose? Rose? Hey Rose, come on, wake up, Rose. Hey. Rose? Rose! Rose goddammit don't do this to me! Rose! Dear God! Rose, baby, wake up wake up, baby, please. Please don't leave me alone. Please don't leave me. I need you. please, goddammit! Wake up please. Wake up please. Now we're even. Oh my God! You bitch! Fuck you! That is not funny! Oh my God! Aw. Don't you ever do that again! That was not fucking funny, Rose! God, I wish I could kill you myself now. They're gone. What? They're gone. Yeah. How's that rejection stinging you? What do you mean? Apparently we lack the one quality they look for in a person. Souls. Of course. They must have been sucking on us all night before figuring out the fridge was empty. Our curse has turned out to be a blessing. We're immune. And ready to start the new day. Ow! Rose, what the fuck? You shot me! Aw, quit your whining, it was an accident. Well get it out! Ow! You did that on purpose! I did not. Yes you did! You were literally chopped up by cannibals yesterday and now you're complaining about a little arrow? Well it fucking hurt, Rose! Ursula. Grow some fucking balls! It's going to be a long walk. Compared to what we've just been through? What, the aliens, the zombies and the psycho fucking cannibals? Yeah. That is a vacation. Can't argue with that. So scary question. What the hell are we going to do when our food supply runs out because every human on this planet is wiped out by those things? Already thought it through. See, at last count there are about 4,500 blood banks in the U.S. alone. So that'll tide us over for at least another century. And then when that taps out, we just migrate someplace else. Always planning ahead. That's what I love about you. And for the record? Worst fucking birthday ever! Yes you did! You were literally... That was so Southern. - I'm proud of you guys. - Yes you did! Head back to him. Oh you're face. All I hear is giggling in my ears. You gotta try and not grab us, right? I've warned people about these things for a long, long time, but they did not heed my warning. What voice am I speaking in, holy shit. Did someone go phewsh? - I did. - Yeah, let's not do that. Oh my gosh. Motherfucker! This is not a good place for this. Ursula, grow some fucking balls!
