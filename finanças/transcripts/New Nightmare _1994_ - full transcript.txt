WITH DYLAN, DOES THAT CHANGE YOUR FEELING, YOUR PERSPECTIVE ABOUT HORROR MOVIES? NO, NOT REALLY. I MEAN, WOULD YOU LET HIM SEE ONE OF YOUR MOVIES? MY SON? NO. I'M SURE PEOPLE ASK YOU THIS ALL THE TIME-- IS THERE GOING TO BE ANOTHER SEQUEL, AND WHAT'S MORE, IS FREDDY REALLY DEAD? OF COURSE HE IS. FREDDY'S DEAD AND GONE. AND HOW ABOUT YOUR COSTAR IN THE ORIGINAL, IN NIGHTMARE 1, WOULD YOU TRUST HIM ALONE WITH DYLAN? ROBERT? I DON'T KNOW. WHY DON'T WE ASK HIM HOW HE'D FEEL ABOUT IT?

THEY LOVED THE EXPRESSION ON YOUR FACE. I THINK THEY'D LIKE TO SEE US TOGETHER AGAIN. IN WHAT, A ROMANTIC COMEDY? JUST BECAUSE IT'S A LOVE STORY DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN'T HAVE A DECAPITATION OR TWO. Man: HEATHER. THERE'S A CALL FOR YOU. FOR ME? LISTEN, I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER. BYE-BYE. BYE-BYE. HELLO? HEATHER, IT'S SARA RISHER OVER AT NEW LINE CINEMA. HOW ARE YOU? HI, SARA. HOW ARE YOU?

HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO JOIN US IN THE DEFINITIVE NIGHTMARE? I THOUGHT YOU KILLED FREDDY OFF. WELL, WE DID, BUT THE FANS, YOU KNOW, THE FANS, GOD BLESS THEM, THEY'RE CLAMORING FOR MORE. I GUESS EVIL NEVER DIES, RIGHT? ANYHOW, A FEW WEEKS AGO, I GOT A CALL FROM WES, AND HE PITCHED ME THIS REALLY EXCITING IDEA, AND I STARTED THINKING, "WHO BETTER TO RESURRECT FREDDY THAN HIS CREATOR?" WELL, I THOUGHT WES STOPPED DOING HORROR MOVIES. [SCOFFS] DO YOU KNOW HE ACTUALLY TOLD ME HE HADN'T CALLED ME IN THE LAST 10 YEARS BECAUSE HE HADN'T HAD ANY REALLY SCARY NIGHTMARES? THEY'RE HIS INSPIRATION FOR THIS THING. ANYHOW, HE'S--HE'S RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SCRIPT. WHICH MEANS HE'S HAVING NIGHTMARES AGAIN. WELL, HE'S VERY EXCITED ABOUT IT. THE NIGHTMARES? NO, SWEETIE, THE SCRIPT. AND YOU SHOULD BE, TOO, BECAUSE... YOU'RE THE STAR. I DON'T KNOW, BOB. I'M FLATTERED, REALLY, BUT I HAVE A KID NOW, AND... WELL, SO? SO I'M NOT SURE ABOUT DOING HORROR.

A COUPLE OF MONTHS. WHY? AND SINCE YOU'VE BEEN THINKING OF MAKING IT, HAS ANYTHING FUNNY HAPPENED? WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WELL, LIKE... WEIRD PHONE CALLS. [TELEPHONE RINGS] OR NIGHTMARES.

[TRUCK STARTS] Heather: "AS SOON AS THE SUN WAS UP, "THE WITCH MADE GRETEL FETCH THE WOOD "AND KINDLE A FIRE. "WE WILL BAKE COOKIES FIRST, SHE SAID. "I'VE HEATED THE OVEN AND KNEADED THE DOUGH. "CRAWL IN AND SEE IF THE FIRE IS BLAZING HIGH ENOUGH NOW. "AND SHE PUSHED GRETEL TOWARD THE OVEN. "THE WITCH WENT TO SHUT THE DOOR AND BAKE HER ONCE SHE WAS INSIDE." DYLAN, THIS IS SO VIOLENT. I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU LIKE THESE STUPID OLD FAIRY TALES. FINISH, PLEASE. THEY'RE GONNA GIVE YOU NIGHTMARES. I LIKE THIS STORY. [SIGHS] "BUT GRETEL GUESSED WHAT THE WITCH WAS PLANNING. "I DON'T KNOW HOW TO GET IN, GRETEL SAID. "HOW AM I TO MANAGE IT? "STUPID GIRL, SHOUTED THE WITCH, "RUSHING UP TO THE OVEN. "THE OPENING IS BIG ENOUGH. SEE? I CAN FIT MYSELF. "THEN QUICKLY, GRETEL CAME BEHIND "AND PUSHED WITH ALL HER MIGHT, "PLUNGING THE WICKED OLD WOMAN HEADLONG INTO THE FLAMES, "BANGING THE DOOR SHUT AND BOLTING IT TIGHT. THE WITCH HOWLED..." THAT'S ENOUGH. "THE WITCH HOWLED LIKE A SCALDED CAT, "BUT GRETEL RAN "AND LEFT HER THERE TO PERISH NONETHELESS. "SHE RAN TO HER BROTHER AS FAST AS SHE COULD, "FLUNG OPEN THE DOOR. HANSEL! HANSEL, SHE CRIED. WE'RE SAVED! THE WITCH IS DEAD." TIME FOR SLEEP. SAY HOW THEY FIND THEIR WAY BACK HOME. TOMORROW NIGHT. NO. TONIGHT. IT'S IMPORTANT. DYLAN, YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO. THEY FOLLOWED THE TRAIL OF BREADCRUMBS BACK TO THEIR HOUSE. AND THEN THEIR FATHER COVERED THEM WITH KISSES, AND THEY WERE SAFE. THEY WERE SAFE, AND THEY COULD SLEEP. COME ON. WHAT IS THAT? REX.

[BIRDS CHIRPING] [GEARS SQUEAKING] Priest: GOD IS OUR HOPE AND STRENGTH, A VERY PRESENT HELP IN TROUBLE. THEREFORE, WE WILL NOT FEAR, THOUGH THE EARTH BE MOVED AND THOUGH THE HILLS BE CARRIED INTO THE MIDST OF THE SEA, THOUGH THE WATERS THEREOF RAGE AND SWELL AND THOUGH THE MOUNTAINS SHAKE AT THE TEMPEST OF THE SAME. [STATUE SHATTERS] [EERIE WHISPERING] [EERIE WHISPERING] JULIE, WHERE'S DYLAN? I--I DON'T KNOW. [EERIE WHISPERING] [EVIL LAUGHTER] AAH! MOMMY! DYLAN! MOMMY! DYLAN! DYLAN, GRAB MOMMY'S HAND. GRAB IT!

WHY DOES GOD LET THERE BE BAD THINGS? I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW, HONEY. PLEASE TRY TO GET SOME SLEEP. CAN YOU COME WITH ME IN MY DREAMS? I THINK THAT ONLY HAPPENS IN THE MOVIES. BUT I'LL ALWAYS, ALWAYS... BE RIGHT HERE WHEN YOU GET BACK. AND I'LL MAKE SURE THAT NOBODY GETS YOUR TOES. UH-HUH. Heather: I KNOW HIS BEHAVIOR IS BIZARRE... BUT HE'S USUALLY SO NORMAL AND WELL ADJUSTED, JOHN, I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S HIM AND NOT SOMETHING OUTSIDE INFLUENCING HIM. OR IS THAT HOW DENIAL WORKS? WELL, IT IS DENIAL. I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE CASE HERE. LOOK, IF YOU'RE REALLY WORRIED ABOUT DYLAN, HAVE A DOCTOR CHECK HIM OUT. YOU'LL SEE. EVERYTHING'S FINE. YOU'RE NOT JUST SAYING THAT TO HELP A CRAZY FRIEND COPE, ARE YOU? [SIGHS] EVERYTHING ABOUT DYLAN'S BEHAVIOR IS UNDERSTANDABLE FOR A KID WHO JUST LOST HIS FATHER. HOW DOES A CHILD PROCESS A THING LIKE THAT? I DON'T KNOW. [BICYCLE BELL RINGS] I'VE NOT BEEN ABLE TO PROCESS IT VERY WELL MYSELF. AND YOU'RE NOT CRAZY, BY THE WAY. SEEING FREDDY IN THAT GRAVE FEELS PRETTY CRAZY AND THEN JUMPING IN-- YOU DIDN'T JUMP IN. THAT'S MY MEMORY. IT SEEMED ABSOLUTELY REAL. "SEEMED," NOT "WAS." IT'S... IT'S IN MY FAMILY, YOU KNOW. WHAT IS? A VERY CLOSE RELATIVE DIED IN AN INSTITUTION. REALLY? WELL, IF HAVING A SCREWY FAMILY MADE A PERSON CRAZY, THE WHOLE WORLD WOULD BE ONE BIG LOONY BIN. [CHUCKLES] YOU HAVE A CRAZED FAN AFTER YOU. THAT'S WHAT'S MAKING YOU CRAZY. AND PROBABLY DYLAN, TOO. I NEVER MENTIONED THAT TO HIM. KIDS KNOW. KIDS KNOW WHEN SOMETHING'S BUGGING THE PARENT. YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHO THIS IS CALLING? FREDDY, FOR ALL I KNOW. COME ON. HE'S A MAN. OR A BOY WITH A DEEP, YOU KNOW... FREDDY VOICE. 6 WEEKS OF THIS, AND YOU'RE SURPRISED YOU GOT FREDDY IN YOUR DREAMS? HELL, SONNY BONO, AFTER A WHILE, BEGAN SEEING HIS STALKER EVERYWHERE, EVEN AT MASS. REALLY? AND HOW MANY TIMES DID LETTERMAN CALL THE COPS, THINKING THAT WOMAN WAS DOWN IN THE KITCHEN AGAIN? YEAH. REALLY GETS UNDER YOUR SKIN IF YOU... IF YOU LET IT. YOU REALLY THINK DYLAN'S OK? DYLAN'S FINE. YOU'RE FINE. YOU'RE HURTING, BUT YOU'RE FINE, AND YOU'RE DEFINITELY NOT CRAZY. MY WORST FEAR-- THAT WHATEVER MADNESS IS IN MY FAMILY I HAVE... AND I'VE PASSED IT ONTO DYLAN. Heather: DYLAN! HEATHER! DYLAN! MAKE SURE HE'S OK, JOHN. YEAH. ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? DYLAN! OH, MY GOD. ARE YOU OK? HUH? ARE YOU SURE? DOES ANYTHING HURT? DYLAN, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? HONEY. ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? ARE YOU SURE? GOD WOULDN'T TAKE ME. OH, MY GOD. OH, HONEY. John: IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

IT ISN'T YOU. HE'S SCARIER. HE'S... DARKER? MORE EVIL? YEAH. HOW DID YOU KNOW? CALL IT A GUESS. PRETTY DAMN GOOD GUESS. ANYWAY WHAT I WAS CALLING ABOUT WAS, HAVE YOU SEEN ANY OF THE SCRIPT BY ANY CHANCE? NO. WES WON'T SHOW IT UNTIL HE'S FINISHED. AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT HE TOLD ME. WELL, WHEN IS IT GONNA BE DONE? [LAUGHING] THE WAY HE'S WRITING, WHO KNOWS? IT'S SO WEIRD. I ASKED HIM HOW FAR HE WAS AT THE FUNERAL. WHAT DID HE SAY? OH, YEAH. "AS FAR AS DYLAN TRYING TO REACH GOD." WHATEVER THAT MEANS. WEIRD, HUH? PUTTING YOUR KID IN THE SCRIPT. ROBERT... HAVE YOU BEEN HAVING NIGHTMARES? [BIRD CAWING] LOOK, WE NEED TO TALK, BUT NOT OVER THE PHONE. CAN I COME OVER? UM, ACTUALLY, HEATHER, UH... TODAY'S NO GOOD. THERE'S, UM... THERE'S SOMETHING I HAVE TO FINISH. TOMORROW MAYBE, HUH? OK, TOMORROW. BUT EARLY IN THE MORNING. AND MEANWHILE, ROBERT, TAKE CARE, OK? YEAH. SURE.

YOU HAVEN'T SHOWN HIM ANY OF THE FILMS YOU'VE MADE, HAVE YOU? THE HORROR STUFF? HIS FATHER JUST PASSED AWAY. I'M SORRY. BUT I'M CONVINCED THOSE FILMS CAN TIP... AN UNSTABLE CHILD OVER THE EDGE. UNSTABLE? DYLAN'S NOT UNSTABLE. HE'S JUST UPSET. WELL, WE'LL RUN A BATTERY OF TESTS, AND WE'LL KNOW IN A FEW DAYS. DOES HE HAVE TO STAY OVERNIGHT? ABSOLUTELY. Woman on P.A.: DR. DEGRASI... ANYTHING MORE HAPPEN WE NEED TO KNOW ABOUT? LIKE WHAT? SOMETIMES WHAT A CHILD SAYS OR FANTASIZES WILL GIVE A CLUE TO WHAT AILS HIM. DID HE SAY ANYTHING WHILE HE WAS STILL LUCID? NO. [TELEPHONE RINGS] [RING] Woman on P.A.: DR. EINHORN, LINE 237. WHAT DO WE HAVE HERE? TOO SOON TO KNOW FOR SURE. THE EARLY SYMPTOMS POINT TO CHILDHOOD SCHIZOPHRENIA. DYLAN, CAN YOU HEAR ME? DYLAN, YOU HAVE TO FIGHT IT, WHATEVER IT IS THAT'S AFTER YOU, AND YOU GOT TO COME BACK TO ME. YOU CAN'T MAKE IT ALONE. DO YOU HEAR? IF YOU CAN HEAR ME, THEN YOU CAN TELL ME WHAT YOU NEED TO FEEL SAFE. REX? IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT? WELL, REX IS AT HOME, AND THAT'S WHERE YOU SHOULD BE. BUT YOU GOT TO GET BETTER BEFORE THEY'LL LET YOU COME HOME. DO YOU UNDERSTAND? HOME. HOME. HOME, THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S WHERE I WANT YOU, SWEETIE. AND, YOU KNOW, WE'RE NOT THAT FAR AWAY. LOOK. LOOK RIGHT OUT THERE. PAST THE FREEWAY IS OUR HOME. BUT TO GET THERE, YOU HAVE TO COME OUT FROM WHERE YOU ARE SO THAT THEY'LL LET YOU COME HOME TO REX. AND TO ME. TIME FOR YOUR MEDICINE, COWBOY. HERE YOU GO. WHAT IS THAT? SOMETHING TO HELP HIM SLEEP. OK. THERE YOU GO. IT LOOKS GOOD. THERE YOU GO. GOOD. GOOD. ATTABOY. COME ON, NOW LIE DOWN AND TAKE A LITTLE NAP. YOU SHOULD GET SOME REST, TOO. HE'S GOING TO BE FINE. WE'RE GONNA DO SOME TESTS, AND THEN YOU CAN COME BACK LATER. CAN YOU GET THAT OTHER SIDE, PLEASE? I GRABBED HIS THINGS. THESE ARE HIS FAVORITE PAJAMAS HERE. UM...HONEY, I'VE GOT TO GO. I LOVE YOU, DYLAN. REMEMBER WHAT I SAID. WE'LL TAKE CARE OF EVERYTHING. GOOD-BYE. [BREATHING] [HORN HONKS] Man: WAKE UP, LADY! DON'T LOSE IT NOW! Woman on radio: SEISMOLOGISTS AT CAL TECH HAVE COUNTED OVER 300 TEMBLORS SO FAR. THOUGH MOST WERE TOO FAINT FOR US TO FEEL, 7 HAVE SHAKEN OUR COMMUNITY IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS, AND NOW SCIENTISTS ARE SPECULATING THERE MIGHT BE AN UNKNOWN FAULT RUNNING BENEATH LOS ANGELES, A FAULT THAT COULD-- [SHUTS OFF RADIO] [BEEP] [DIALING] [LINE RINGS] Robert: HI. YOU'VE REACHED THE ENGLUND RESIDENCE. WE'RE OUT OF TOWN. YOU CAN LEAVE A MESSAGE IF YOU WISH, BUT, UH... WE'LL BE GONE FOR SOME TIME. I WISH I COULD TELL YOU WHERE THE SCRIPT WAS GOING. THE FACT IS I DON'T KNOW. NO, I...I DREAM A SCENE AT NIGHT, I WRITE IT DOWN IN THE MORNING. BEYOND THAT, YOUR GUESS IS AS GOOD AS MINE WHERE IT'S GOING. WELL, AT LEAST TELL ME WHAT IT'S ABOUT SO FAR. COFFEE. THANKS. I CAN TELL YOU WHAT THE NIGHTMARE'S ABOUT SO FAR. IT'S ABOUT THIS ENTITY-- WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT. IT'S OLD. IT'S VERY OLD. [SIGHS] IT'S EXISTED IN DIFFERENT FORMS IN DIFFERENT TIMES. ABOUT THE ONLY THING THAT STAYS THE SAME IS WHAT IT LIVES FOR, REALLY. WHAT IS THAT? OH, THE MURDER OF INNOCENTS. THIS IS STILL A SCRIPT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT, RIGHT, WES? YEAH, WELL, I SORT OF THINK OF IT AS A NIGHTMARE IN PROGRESS. WELL, IN THIS NIGHTMARE IN PROGRESS THEN, DOES THIS THING HAVE ANY WEAKNESSES? YEAH, WELL, IT CAN BE CAPTURED SOMETIMES. CAPTURED? HOW? BY STORYTELLERS, OF ALL THINGS. I MEAN, EVERY SO OFTEN, THEY IMAGINE A STORY GOOD ENOUGH TO SORT OF CATCH ITS ESSENCE. AND THEN, FOR A WHILE IT'S HELD PRISONER IN THE STORY. LIKE THE GENIE IN THE BOTTLE. EXACTLY. EXACTLY. BUT THE PROBLEM COMES WHEN THE STORY DIES. AND THAT CAN HAPPEN IN A LOT OF WAYS. IT CAN GET TOO FAMILIAR TO PEOPLE OR SOMEBODY WATERS IT DOWN TO MAKE IT AN EASIER SELL, YOU KNOW, OR... MAYBE IT'S JUST SO UPSETTING TO SOCIETY THAT IT'S BANNED OUTRIGHT. HOWEVER IT HAPPENS, WHEN THE STORY DIES, THE EVIL IS SET FREE. YOU'RE SAYING FREDDY IS THIS ANCIENT THING? RIGHT. THE CURRENT VERSION. AND FOR 10 YEARS, HE'S BEEN HELD CAPTIVE PRETTY MUCH AS FREDDY IN THE NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET SERIES, BUT... NOW THAT THE FILMS HAVE ENDED, THE GENIE'S OUT OF THE BOTTLE. THAT'S WHAT THE NIGHTMARES ARE TELLING ME. THAT'S WHAT I'M WRITING. WELL, IF FREDDY IS LOOSE IN YOUR SCRIPT, WHERE'S HE GONNA GO? ANOTHER AGE? ANOTHER FORM? NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT THE DREAMS HAVE HIM DOING. WHAT IS HE DOING? HE'S SORT OF GOTTEN USED TO BEING FREDDY NOW, AND HE LIKES OUR TIME AND SPACE, SO HE'S DECIDED TO CROSS OVER OUT OF FILMS INTO OUR REALITY. ISN'T THERE SOMEBODY WHO CAN STOP HIM? ACTUALLY THERE IS A PERSON IN THE DREAM, SORT OF A GATEKEEPER, SO TO SPEAK. SOMEBODY THAT FREDDY HAS TO GET BY BEFORE HE CAN COME THROUGH INTO OUR WORLD. THAT PERSON'S YOU, HEATHER. IT'S ME? YEAH. WHY ME? WELL, DRAMATICALLY SPEAKING, IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE. YOU PLAYED NANCY, AFTER ALL, AND YOU WERE THE FIRST TO HUMILIATE HIM, DEFEAT HIM. THAT WAS NANCY, WES. THAT'S NOT ME. YEAH, BUT IT WAS YOU THAT GAVE NANCY HER STRENGTH. SO IN ORDER TO GET OUT, HE'S GOT TO COME THROUGH YOU. AND IT'S INEVITABLE THAT HE'S GONNA TRY TO DO THAT AT YOUR MOST VULNERABLE POINTS. OH, MY GOD, WES. DID YOU KNOW? IT--IT WAS A SCRIPT. IT WAS A DREAM. I DIDN'T-- I DIDN'T KNOW. YOU KNOW DAMN WELL IT'S MORE THAN THAT NOW. WES. WES? HOW CAN WE STOP HIM? I THINK THE ONLY WAY TO STOP HIM IS TO MAKE ANOTHER MOVIE. NOW I SWEAR TO YOU, I'M GONNA STAY BY THIS COMPUTER AND KEEP WRITING UNTIL I FINISH THE SCRIPT, BUT... WHEN THAT TIME COMES, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO MAKE A CHOICE. CHOICE? WHAT KIND OF CHOICE? WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE WILLING TO PLAY NANCY ONE LAST TIME. "MANY OF THE SYMPTOMS OF CHILDHOOD SCHIZOPHRENIA "ARE DUPLICATED IN CHILDREN SUFFERING FROM SLEEP DEPRIVATION." "SLEEP DEPRIVATION CAN PRODUCE TRANCE-LIKE STATES, "MECHANICAL BEHAVIOR. THE CHILD MIGHT..." REX WOKE ME UP. HE WAS FIGHTING THE MEAN OLD MAN WITH THE CLAWS. YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHO THIS IS CALLING? FREDDY, FOR ALL I KNOW. AS IN ME? NO, IT ISN'T YOU. HE'S SCARIER. DARKER, MORE EVIL? HOW DID YOU KNOW? HE'S DECIDED TO CROSS OVER, OUT OF FILMS, INTO OUR REALITY. NEVER SLEEP AGAIN. [STATIC HISSING] THE WORLD OF HORROR FILMS SUFFERED ITS OWN TERROR TODAY, AS 2 OF HOLLYWOOD'S BEST KNOWN SPECIAL-EFFECTS TECHNICIANS WERE FOUND DEAD IN A VACANT FIELD. TERRANCE FEINSTEIN AND CHARLES WILSON, 2 SPECIAL-EFFECTS ARTISTS REPUTEDLY WORKING ON A TOP-SECRET PROJECT FOR THE MAKERS OF THE FREDDY KRUEGER FILMS WERE FOUND BRUTALLY SLASHED TO DEATH EARLY THIS MORNING. [RUMBLING] FREDDY'S GLOVE WAS MISSING, AND POLICE ARE SPECULATING THE MURDERS WERE THE RESULT OF A BOTCHED THEFT, WHICH APPARENTLY TOOK PLACE 2 DAYS AGO.

EARLIER HE HAD SOME PROBLEMS. HE'S IN AN OXYGEN TENT NOW. OH, MY GOD. HEATHER. SEEMS WE'VE HAD AN ACCIDENT, MISS LANGENKAMP. MAY I? THOSE ARE NASTY CUTS. HOW DID YOU GET THEM? IT HAPPENED IN THE EARTHQUAKE. I FELL. I NEED TO SEE DYLAN. IN A MOMENT. FIRST LET'S SEE ABOUT YOU. IF THESE HAD BEEN A FEW INCHES NEARER THE WRIST... WHAT DID YOU SAY YOU CUT YOURSELF ON? IT WAS THE EARTHQUAKE. IT WAS DARK. I HAVE NO IDEA. BUT THESE LOOK QUITE FRESH. THEY ARE. IT HAPPENED IN TONIGHT'S EARTHQUAKE. IT HAPPENED JUST 15 MINUTES AGO. YOU MUST HAVE FELT IT. GUESS WE LUCKED OUT OVER HERE. YOUR SON... IS APPARENTLY TERRIFIED OF A MAN-- SOMEONE HE THINKS IS GOING TO COME OUT OF HIS BED. ONE OF THE NURSES HEARD HIM TALKING TO HIMSELF. DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHO THAT MAN IS, MISS LANGENKAMP? I FORGOT TO BRING HIS DINOSAUR REX. HE KEEPS FREDDY FROM COMING UP OUT OF HIS-- BED. THE MAN FROM YOUR FILMS? FREDDY KRUEGER? WITH THE CLAWS? IS THAT WHO HE'S AFRAID OF? YOU HAVE LET YOUR CHILD SEE YOUR FILMS, HAVEN'T YOU? EVERY KID KNOWS WHO FREDDY IS. HE'S LIKE SANTA CLAUS... OR KING KONG OR... YES. WELL, INTERESTING TALKING WITH YOU, MISS LANGENKAMP. I HOPE YOU UNDERSTAND. MY CONCERNS ARE SIMPLY FOR THE WELFARE OF YOUR SON. [HEART MONITOR BEEPING] [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] HOW'S HE DOING?

HE WAS HERE, YOU FELL ASLEEP, WE TOOK HIM. YOU LOOKED SO EXHAUSTED, FRANKLY, WE DIDN'T WANT TO WAKE YOU. BESIDES, THE YOUNG WOMAN JULIE IS WITH HIM. THAT'S HIS BABY-SITTER, RIGHT? BELIEVE ME.

HE SEEMS TO BE SUFFERING FROM ACUTE SLEEP DEPRIVATION. [WHISPERING] I don't think she ever lets him get a night's sleep. WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? WHERE IS HE? HEATHER. I'VE GOT SOMEONE HERE WHO WANTS TO SEE YOU. Heather: DYLAN. OH, DYLAN, OH. ARE YOU OK, CHAMP? CAN WE GO GET REX NOW? THE BAD MAN'S GETTING AWFUL CLOSE. I KNOW HE IS. WE'RE GONNA GO GET REX RIGHT NOW. I'M AFRAID DYLAN SHOULD STAY HERE UNTIL WE KNOW WHAT'S CAUSING THESE EPISODES, MISS LANGENKAMP. I'M SURE YOU UNDERSTAND. GOOD. LOOK, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT. I'M GONNA GO HOME AND GET REX FOR YOU RIGHT NOW. YOU KNOW THAT HOME ISN'T FAR FROM HERE, RIGHT? RIGHT ACROSS THE FREEWAY. THAT'S RIGHT.
