WITH DYLAN, DOES THAT CHANGE YOUR FEELING, YOUR PERSPECTIVE ABOUT HORROR MOVIES? NO, NOT REALLY. I MEAN, WOULD YOU LET HIM SEE ONE OF YOUR MOVIES? MY SON? NO. I'M SURE PEOPLE ASK YOU THIS ALL THE TIME-- IS THERE GOING TO BE ANOTHER SEQUEL, AND WHAT'S MORE, IS FREDDY REALLY DEAD? OF COURSE HE IS. FREDDY'S DEAD AND GONE. AND HOW ABOUT YOUR COSTAR IN THE ORIGINAL, IN NIGHTMARE 1, WOULD YOU TRUST HIM ALONE WITH DYLAN? ROBERT? I DON'T KNOW. WHY DON'T WE ASK HIM HOW HE'D FEEL ABOUT IT? WE'VE GOT A BIG SURPRISE FOR YOU, HEATHER, AND FOR OUR AUDIENCE. LET'S BRING HIM OUT. HE IS THE BEST OF THE BAD. LET'S SAY HELLO TO ROBERT ENGLUND. [APPLAUSE] HA HA! LOVE YA, BABE! WE'LL DO LUNCH!

THEY LOVED THE EXPRESSION ON YOUR FACE. I THINK THEY'D LIKE TO SEE US TOGETHER AGAIN. IN WHAT, A ROMANTIC COMEDY? JUST BECAUSE IT'S A LOVE STORY DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN'T HAVE A DECAPITATION OR TWO.

I GUESS EVIL NEVER DIES, RIGHT? ANYHOW, A FEW WEEKS AGO, I GOT A CALL FROM WES, AND HE PITCHED ME THIS REALLY EXCITING IDEA, AND I STARTED THINKING, "WHO BETTER TO RESURRECT FREDDY THAN HIS CREATOR?" WELL, I THOUGHT WES STOPPED DOING HORROR MOVIES. [SCOFFS] DO YOU KNOW HE ACTUALLY TOLD ME HE HADN'T CALLED ME IN THE LAST 10 YEARS BECAUSE HE HADN'T HAD ANY REALLY SCARY NIGHTMARES? THEY'RE HIS INSPIRATION FOR THIS THING. ANYHOW, HE'S--HE'S RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SCRIPT. WHICH MEANS HE'S HAVING NIGHTMARES AGAIN. WELL, HE'S VERY EXCITED ABOUT IT. THE NIGHTMARES? NO, SWEETIE, THE SCRIPT. AND YOU SHOULD BE, TOO, BECAUSE... YOU'RE THE STAR. I DON'T KNOW, BOB. I'M FLATTERED, REALLY, BUT I HAVE A KID NOW, AND... WELL, SO? SO I'M NOT SURE ABOUT DOING HORROR.

DYLAN, YOU HAVE TO FIGHT IT, WHATEVER IT IS THAT'S AFTER YOU, AND YOU GOT TO COME BACK TO ME. YOU CAN'T MAKE IT ALONE. DO YOU HEAR? IF YOU CAN HEAR ME, THEN YOU CAN TELL ME WHAT YOU NEED TO FEEL SAFE. REX? IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT? WELL, REX IS AT HOME, AND THAT'S WHERE YOU SHOULD BE. BUT YOU GOT TO GET BETTER BEFORE THEY'LL LET YOU COME HOME. DO YOU UNDERSTAND? HOME. HOME. HOME, THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S WHERE I WANT YOU, SWEETIE. AND, YOU KNOW, WE'RE NOT THAT FAR AWAY. LOOK. LOOK RIGHT OUT THERE. PAST THE FREEWAY IS OUR HOME. BUT TO GET THERE, YOU HAVE TO COME OUT FROM WHERE YOU ARE SO THAT THEY'LL LET YOU COME HOME TO REX. AND TO ME. TIME FOR YOUR MEDICINE, COWBOY. HERE YOU GO. WHAT IS THAT? SOMETHING TO HELP HIM SLEEP. OK. THERE YOU GO. IT LOOKS GOOD. THERE YOU GO. GOOD. GOOD. ATTABOY. COME ON, NOW LIE DOWN AND TAKE A LITTLE NAP. YOU SHOULD GET SOME REST, TOO. HE'S GOING TO BE FINE. WE'RE GONNA DO SOME TESTS, AND THEN YOU CAN COME BACK LATER. CAN YOU GET THAT OTHER SIDE, PLEASE? I GRABBED HIS THINGS. THESE ARE HIS FAVORITE PAJAMAS HERE. UM...HONEY, I'VE GOT TO GO. I LOVE YOU, DYLAN. REMEMBER WHAT I SAID. WE'LL TAKE CARE OF EVERYTHING. GOOD-BYE. [BREATHING] [HORN HONKS] Man: WAKE UP, LADY! DON'T LOSE IT NOW! Woman on radio: SEISMOLOGISTS AT CAL TECH HAVE COUNTED OVER 300 TEMBLORS SO FAR. THOUGH MOST WERE TOO FAINT FOR US TO FEEL, 7 HAVE SHAKEN OUR COMMUNITY IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS, AND NOW SCIENTISTS ARE SPECULATING THERE MIGHT BE AN UNKNOWN FAULT RUNNING BENEATH LOS ANGELES, A FAULT THAT COULD-- [SHUTS OFF RADIO] [BEEP] [DIALING] [LINE RINGS] Robert: HI. YOU'VE REACHED THE ENGLUND RESIDENCE. WE'RE OUT OF TOWN. YOU CAN LEAVE A MESSAGE IF YOU WISH, BUT, UH... WE'LL BE GONE FOR SOME TIME. I WISH I COULD TELL YOU WHERE THE SCRIPT WAS GOING. THE FACT IS I DON'T KNOW. NO, I...I DREAM A SCENE AT NIGHT, I WRITE IT DOWN IN THE MORNING. BEYOND THAT, YOUR GUESS IS AS GOOD AS MINE WHERE IT'S GOING. WELL, AT LEAST TELL ME WHAT IT'S ABOUT SO FAR. COFFEE. THANKS. I CAN TELL YOU WHAT THE NIGHTMARE'S ABOUT SO FAR. IT'S ABOUT THIS ENTITY-- WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT. IT'S OLD. IT'S VERY OLD. [SIGHS] IT'S EXISTED IN DIFFERENT FORMS IN DIFFERENT TIMES. ABOUT THE ONLY THING THAT STAYS THE SAME IS WHAT IT LIVES FOR, REALLY. WHAT IS THAT? OH, THE MURDER OF INNOCENTS. THIS IS STILL A SCRIPT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT, RIGHT, WES? YEAH, WELL, I SORT OF THINK OF IT AS A NIGHTMARE IN PROGRESS. WELL, IN THIS NIGHTMARE IN PROGRESS THEN, DOES THIS THING HAVE ANY WEAKNESSES? YEAH, WELL, IT CAN BE CAPTURED SOMETIMES. CAPTURED? HOW? BY STORYTELLERS, OF ALL THINGS. I MEAN, EVERY SO OFTEN, THEY IMAGINE A STORY GOOD ENOUGH TO SORT OF CATCH ITS ESSENCE. AND THEN, FOR A WHILE IT'S HELD PRISONER IN THE STORY. LIKE THE GENIE IN THE BOTTLE. EXACTLY. EXACTLY. BUT THE PROBLEM COMES WHEN THE STORY DIES. AND THAT CAN HAPPEN IN A LOT OF WAYS. IT CAN GET TOO FAMILIAR TO PEOPLE OR SOMEBODY WATERS IT DOWN TO MAKE IT AN EASIER SELL, YOU KNOW, OR... MAYBE IT'S JUST SO UPSETTING TO SOCIETY THAT IT'S BANNED OUTRIGHT. HOWEVER IT HAPPENS, WHEN THE STORY DIES, THE EVIL IS SET FREE. YOU'RE SAYING FREDDY IS THIS ANCIENT THING? RIGHT. THE CURRENT VERSION. AND FOR 10 YEARS, HE'S BEEN HELD CAPTIVE PRETTY MUCH AS FREDDY IN THE NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET SERIES, BUT... NOW THAT THE FILMS HAVE ENDED, THE GENIE'S OUT OF THE BOTTLE. THAT'S WHAT THE NIGHTMARES ARE TELLING ME. THAT'S WHAT I'M WRITING. WELL, IF FREDDY IS LOOSE IN YOUR SCRIPT, WHERE'S HE GONNA GO? ANOTHER AGE? ANOTHER FORM? NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT THE DREAMS HAVE HIM DOING. WHAT IS HE DOING? HE'S SORT OF GOTTEN USED TO BEING FREDDY NOW, AND HE LIKES OUR TIME AND SPACE, SO HE'S DECIDED TO CROSS OVER OUT OF FILMS INTO OUR REALITY. ISN'T THERE SOMEBODY WHO CAN STOP HIM? ACTUALLY THERE IS A PERSON IN THE DREAM, SORT OF A GATEKEEPER, SO TO SPEAK. SOMEBODY THAT FREDDY HAS TO GET BY BEFORE HE CAN COME THROUGH INTO OUR WORLD. THAT PERSON'S YOU, HEATHER. IT'S ME? YEAH. WHY ME? WELL, DRAMATICALLY SPEAKING, IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE. YOU PLAYED NANCY, AFTER ALL, AND YOU WERE THE FIRST TO HUMILIATE HIM, DEFEAT HIM. THAT WAS NANCY, WES. THAT'S NOT ME. YEAH, BUT IT WAS YOU THAT GAVE NANCY HER STRENGTH. SO IN ORDER TO GET OUT, HE'S GOT TO COME THROUGH YOU. AND IT'S INEVITABLE THAT HE'S GONNA TRY TO DO THAT AT YOUR MOST VULNERABLE POINTS. OH, MY GOD, WES. DID YOU KNOW? IT--IT WAS A SCRIPT. IT WAS A DREAM. I DIDN'T-- I DIDN'T KNOW. YOU KNOW DAMN WELL IT'S MORE THAN THAT NOW. WES. WES? HOW CAN WE STOP HIM? I THINK THE ONLY WAY TO STOP HIM IS TO MAKE ANOTHER MOVIE. NOW I SWEAR TO YOU, I'M GONNA STAY BY THIS COMPUTER AND KEEP WRITING UNTIL I FINISH THE SCRIPT, BUT... WHEN THAT TIME COMES, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO MAKE A CHOICE. CHOICE? WHAT KIND OF CHOICE? WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE WILLING TO PLAY NANCY ONE LAST TIME. "MANY OF THE SYMPTOMS OF CHILDHOOD SCHIZOPHRENIA "ARE DUPLICATED IN CHILDREN SUFFERING FROM SLEEP DEPRIVATION." "SLEEP DEPRIVATION CAN PRODUCE TRANCE-LIKE STATES, "MECHANICAL BEHAVIOR.

DARKER, MORE EVIL? HOW DID YOU KNOW? HE'S DECIDED TO CROSS OVER, OUT OF FILMS, INTO OUR REALITY. NEVER SLEEP AGAIN.

GUESS WE LUCKED OUT OVER HERE. YOUR SON... IS APPARENTLY TERRIFIED OF A MAN-- SOMEONE HE THINKS IS GOING TO COME OUT OF HIS BED. ONE OF THE NURSES HEARD HIM TALKING TO HIMSELF. DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHO THAT MAN IS, MISS LANGENKAMP? I FORGOT TO BRING HIS DINOSAUR REX. HE KEEPS FREDDY FROM COMING UP OUT OF HIS-- BED. THE MAN FROM YOUR FILMS? FREDDY KRUEGER? WITH THE CLAWS? IS THAT WHO HE'S AFRAID OF? YOU HAVE LET YOUR CHILD SEE YOUR FILMS, HAVEN'T YOU? EVERY KID KNOWS WHO FREDDY IS. HE'S LIKE SANTA CLAUS... OR KING KONG OR... YES. WELL, INTERESTING TALKING WITH YOU, MISS LANGENKAMP. I HOPE YOU UNDERSTAND. MY CONCERNS ARE SIMPLY FOR THE WELFARE OF YOUR SON. [HEART MONITOR BEEPING] [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] HOW'S HE DOING?
