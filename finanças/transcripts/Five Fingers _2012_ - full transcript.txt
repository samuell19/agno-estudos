Episode 16 How did you obtain spruce? Didn't I tell you? Father passed it down to me. An immensely huge spruce storage. What? You haven't forgotten your promise, right? Now, the owner of Boosung Instrument is me. Yoo Ji Ho... now, it's finished for you. You are ready to leave, right? Is it really Alaskan spruce? Why? Can't you believe me? Is it that you can't believe that there are so many spruce trees? Or is it that you can't believe that dad handed it down only to me? I can't understand that he asked only you to open it. There is no reason for that. The reason is... he trusted and acknowledged me more than his kid from a mistress whom he brought from outside. Now do you get it? That there is nobody on your side. Even if he had given everything to you, I don't doubt dad. I can't stop here. I will make a proper piano for dad. I have no intentions on preventing you if you would really like to. But you need to keep the promise that you made before. With this, the largest shareholder of Boosung Group has changed from Executive Director Yoo Ji Ho to Department Head Yoo In Ha. You needn't feel like it is unfair. As a last favor, I will not kick you out from your executive manager position. As a form of repentance, concentrate your energy into marketing. What I want to guard is not my shares nor the executive manager position. Even if I lose everything, I will never give up on making my piano. It won't happen as you wish, Mother. What position would you like? As you saved the company, I must give you a reward accordingly. Whether it is the President of Boosung Instruments or the Chair of the Group... tell me anything. I am always ready to leave for you. The President of Boosung Instruments. I have the confidence to do well. Attorney Choi! Declare that the largest shareholder has changed to the directors. And please get the inauguration of the President of Boosung Instruments ready also. What is it that you want, Father? Who on earth... did you want to take over Boosung? I couldn't even guard the company... I couldn't even get to keep the promise to you, Father... Why did you give me such an assignment? Why? Da Mi... the person I really want to get congratulated from is you... Is that being too shameless? Da Mi! What ring is this? Did you get proposed by Mr. Piano by any chance? Isn't it pretty? It is made from piano wire. Ji Ho made it himself and put it on for me. Piano wire? Didn't you say that he was really rich? He must be a real stingy! He should at least give you a 5 carat teardrop diamond. Are you two... really in love? Those things are not important. It's the thought that counts. You're right! I'm only envious. And also, because the piano wire is durable, it doesn't snap easily. You guys will never leave each other and everything will be a happy ending! I can assure you. Only if you exchange expensive wedding jewels, because of the money you won't be able to break up easily. Why do you guys not know the world that well? Even if you don't know, you don't know too much. For someone who knows so much, why did you leave your boss? Thinking about the principal (money), you should have lived with him for a long, long time. What! Dori-dori Shin Dori! Did you give me anything when we divorced? Ji Ho, you came? Should we call Da-mi and go watch a movie? I have a movie I want to watch. What's wrong with him? Is he becoming like In-Ha? Also, what's wrong with his face? What are you doing? Are you getting out of the house? I'm going to get some fresh air. Don't worry too much about it. Why are you doing this? Is it because of the arboretum in Gapyeong or something? Foolish little brat. When he handed the whole company to you. What's so bad about handing over a piece of wood? If the company is yours, then in the end that piece of wood would become yours too! Now, Boosung Instrument... ...is not mine. What is that supposed to mean? Who did you hand over the company to? I'll go now. Wait! Ji Ho! Wait a second! Hello, it's me. I hope you were well. I was wondering about you anyway. Pardon? Right now? Why are you packing all these stuff when you don't know where I am going? You're going to go to that fishing place that you went often with your father. I am a crack hand, right? If you become my age, you are almost a shaman even though you don't lay out a mat (to do shaman practice). - Hello! Please come. Da Mi! What brings you here? Grandma made me a request to be your bodyguard for today. What? Hurry up and leave. If it gets dark, you will wander. This is nurse Kang Jae Hoon, right? Could we meet momentarily? I don't know about it. I will be leaving. I came here knowing everything. If you don't talk properly. Remember that you will rot in prison for the crime of abandonment of baby. Madam.... As long as I have found out, I will never let this go. Tell me... You hid the baby after getting money from a person called Na Gae Hwa, right? Where did you send him? I... just... My crime is only doing an errand in the middle. She asked me send the child to an orphanage... Really, that is all! Really... was that child really still alive? Deceiving me that an alive child is dead... And with that money, you are doing business? Oh my god! Where is the orphanage? You must remember, right? Let's drink all we want to. Because today, I have finally become the President of Boosung Instruments. I have finally inherited my father's position... though after many vicissitudes... Isn't life really fun? Hey, Yoo In Ha... congratulations. You are cool! Everybody drink! Bravo! - Here! - Wow! Yoo In Ha. Why aren't you laughing? Why aren't you laughing? WHY? Today is such a happy day. From now, it is all yours. Hurry up and laugh. I said laugh. In Ha. Da Mi. Hong Da Mi, Why did you come here now? I wanted to see you so much. In Ha, get a grip on yourself. Why are you doing this? Da Mi, I'm sorry. I've done wrong. I shouldn't have done that to you. I, honestly, want to turn back the clock. To the good old days when you and I were friends. Da Mi... Da Mi. Once when I was very young, I came with my Dad and In Ha. Even then, In Ha and I were competing to catch the most fish. Because you are brothers, you grow up fighting like that, don't you? I'm not sure why, because it seemed like my father turned his back on me, It held the reins on my mind. Don't think that you lost it, but think that you gave it to him. Because now may be the best opportunity to make amends with In Ha. Did you never even once fight with your brother while growing up? My brother always loses for me. After dad passed away, our family was in financial difficulties, my brother bought me a packet of munchies every time I cried because I wanted to see my father. I would later know that he used to go walking to school in order to buy me those snacks. Because your father died so prematurely, I see it must have been very difficult. Mother went through a lot of trouble. There isn't a thing that she didn't do (for a living). In the morning she cleaned a building, during the day, she ran the pancake business that my father did. At night, she worked at a late night snack shop. I think I never once saw my mother sleep. I would like to let her live in luxury at least from now... I will do well. Lean on me if you have any difficulties from now on. I will do everything for you, including your father's share. I will make sure you never cry again for the rest of your life. You promised, OK? That you will always be by side when I am in difficulties. That we will never break up. Satisfied? You trust me, right? Yes. Thank you. You came. Are you very tired? Did you eat dinner? Yes. Where's Da Mi? She is on a date and she called that she will be late. She said that she is going out in the open air after a long time, so I let her. Is she still seeing that guy? I requested so much for her to break up with him. Woo Ji, why do you hate Ji Ho so much? The way I see it, he seems like a good guy. Doesn't it suffice that he cares for Da Mi and that they love each other? It cannot be! Even if she was to be born again, she can't with him ever. You should at least make Da Mi stop. Please do as I tell you to. Really, why is he like this? When he is always on Da Mi's side. What happened? Why am I in your car? Shouldn't you thank me first? I guarded an unconscious person all this time safely. Did I make any mistakes by any chance? There is nothing to be worried about. It was good seeing your true self for the first time. Are you in a lot of hardship? It is very painful to see someone who like looking at another person. Let's go now. It's very late. If love is excessive, it becomes an obsession. And it can also be violence to the person being loved. Even I am hurt by the love you are doing. What do you know about me to be talking like that? Forget about my request to help each other out. I don't want to become any more pitiful. He is a person with more wounds than I had thought. Somang (Hope) Orphanage 031-978-5388 206-87, Munji-ri, Tanhyeon-myeon, Paju-si, Gyeonggi-do What on earth do I plan to do by finding this kid? It is all completely useless. No... But, shouldn't I at least once see how he is living? If he hasn't died and is living somewhere. That kid... are you not going to look for him? Who? Who do you think? Jeung Wook and your kid. I told you... that under the skies, In Ha is my only child. I don't even believe what you are saying. But even if it was the truth, that kid has got nothing to do with me. How can you be unconcerned? He is a kid that you gave birth to. It's not like Chairman Yoo is alive, and you no longer have a husband who supervises over you, shouldn't you find him and at least wash off the dirt on him? Who would know? He could be living as a nuisance in somebody's house getting abused like Ji Ho. Please watch what you are saying. Did I say something wrong? Whatever... He is the blood relation of the president of a conglomerate, it is too much for him to be living as an adopted kid in another person's home. How dare you say something like that when you caused all of this. Who is the person who sabotaged the kid's life? Exactly... That is why I am telling you to take revenge on Chairman Yoo at least now. See... even Chairman Yoo brought Ji Ho from outside and raised him. You should also bring a kid from outside for it to be even... to be the same. Of course... though it seems like a broken family. Don't argue about this matter ever again. Please watch your mouth so that this doesn't get heard by the kids. Thinking about what you did, it is terrible just looking at your face, it makes me crazy... Just know that I am trying to hold back with all my might. Such a vicious woman! I said that her kid is alive... but she doesn't even blink an eye. Your mother must be worried, go ahead in. Yes. Go home safely. You may catch a cold, so drink a lot of hot teas. Yoo Ji Ho. We've met, haven't we? Ah. You're Chief Hong from Keum Dan Construction. I am Da Mi's older brother. Let's have a chat. End it with Da Mi immediately. If you don't want Da Mi to get hurt, end it here. What are you saying now? Don't ask anything and just do as I tell you to! I will never see my sister get hurt anymore by being involved with your family. If you linger around my younger sister's surroundings once more... Then even I can't guarantee what I'll do. I'm sorry... but I can't break up with Da Mi. Please explain to me first why you are doing this. Your father, Chairman Yoo Man Se... Do you know how he died? Why all of a sudden are you talking about my father...? How much do you know about the fire that took place 14 years back in Sungbuk-dong? The day when your father died, in the living room of that house another person died also. That was MY FATHER! I don't understand anything you're saying! Why was your father in the living room of our house...? You really don't know? He was falsely charged with murder and he was also blamed for theft. You really don't know my father who died under false accusations? What do you mean by falsely charged with murder and theft? What on earth are you saying now? Please explain in a way I can understand! My father jumped into the pit of fire to save your family members. But the person who made that innocent person into a murderer and thief is your mother, Chae Young Rang. Why would my mother falsely charge Da Mi's father with murder? There is no reason for that. Should I tell you? The real culprit who killed your father... was your mother, Chae Young Rang! That doesn't make sense! How could that be? Do you even know what the hell you are saying now? Tell me that it's not. Take back your words right now! You may not want to believe it but everything is true. My family lived in that terrible hell. But now you say you love Da Mi? What right do you have? What right do you have to meet Da Mi? Don't ever appear in front of us again! Please get out of our life. Oppa, where have you been? Did you go exercising? Hurry and wash up. Maeuntang (hot fish stew) is deliciously prepared. I don't feel like eating. Is Woo Jin still feeling low? Yeah. He is really pissed off at me these days. I think he is sad that I have a boyfriend. It's really strange, why is he like that? What about Ji Ho does he not like to be acting like that? It's was a fire accident and they said he passed away while trying to save someone else. No ways... That can't be. No! It can't be. Thank you and I love you. Hang in there! Keep it up! We should first register the copyright for the masterpiece piano and then start operating the factory. We should increase the number of commercials and start promoting it in full earnest. You know that famous foreign players are already taking an interest in it, right? Can't you stop talking about the office when we eat? The of you are always together in the office, do you have to talk about that piano even at the dinning table? I'm sorry if it was unpleasant to hear. What? And this is your allowance. Now, I will also put in an effort. Grandma, please think of me well. I request. Oh my god! How much is this? You became the president and you change so suddenly. Were you such a troublemaker all this time because you couldn't be president? You've come now! Were you with Da Mi all this time? The real culprit who killed your father was your mother, Chae Young Rang. He seems to be completely out of his mind. How can he be going around dating in this state of affairs? Has he fallen into despair? He must have gotten really shocked. As it is the first time he has been completely defeated by me. Is something wrong? Has he lost his mind? Ji Ho, why are you like this? There is something that I want to ask. Father... how did he die? Why are you asking that out of the blues? There is still some time before his commemorative rite. It was definitely an accident, right? A fire took place and that is why Father passed away, right? Well... It was an accident but... Why? Can't you remember? A man, who came to rob the home, pushed your father and he got killed. Later, we found out that he was a dumb pancake seller. Regardless of how difficult your financial situation is, why rob? With the reports that the masterpiece piano was successfully reenacted, already 1,000 pianos are preordered. 1,000 pianos? Even if we operate the factory at full capacity, I don't know if we will be able to meet the order. We need to increase the price in order to cover the labor costs. On top of that, the stock price that had fallen is increasing again. Ah! Juilliard School of Music has also inquired about a purchase. It is a good opportunity to promote Boosung Instruments to the world. At this opportunity, I will definitely make it grow into the world best instrument company. Of course you should. That is also the reason why your father handed this company to you. Today is the day for the site visit of the subsidiaries. The sales of shopping mall which was opened this month is continuously on the rise. Is that so? Let's leave. 1998 Sungbuk-dong Fire Incident The History of Boosung Group... Previous Chairman Yoo Man Se Dead From a Fire. President Chae Young Rang a Suspect. A torn up will... Cerebral hemorrhage because of a concussion... An intentionally cut phone line... A hairpin... The suspect, Chae Yung Rang... The suspect, Chae Young Rang? Hello? Is it Sungbuk police department? I need to inquire something. The sales have gone up a lot. Since it has many entertainment factors apart from shopping, I think that the young customers are pretty satisfied. I feel good because the shop is lively. How about installing a masterpiece piano in the square? If we give the customers an opportunity to personally play it, it will have help promotions and I think it will be good. Yes, it's a good idea. Push ahead with it starting this month. Yes. Secretary Oh, what is it? Why would Sungbuk police department? What did you say? Ji Ho? Are you getting well prepared to greet the group customers? Serve according to the preorder. Set the table neatly without any mistakes. Yes, Manager. In Ha? Long time no see. Was it you who made the group reservation? I said that I would treat the employees to celebrate the success of our project at work. Are you uncomfortable? No, sit down quickly. I will serve you immediately. I'll be going. Thanks for today. There is no need to thank me, it is my job. Bye. Let's clean this up together. What are you doing after work? Don't know. - Should we treat ourselves? - Let's! Should we? You smile so broadly even to people you don't know. Why are you so stingy only to me? Still... it feels good to see you smiling. I'm back. OK. There is something I want to ask. What is it? Father... about his death. Is there something that I should know? What is that supposed to mean? During the fire... the culprit who killed father... there is word that he was falsely charged. Are you in your right mind? Your father died so unjustly because of the robber that entered the house. How can you say something unspeakable like that? That man also died in the accident. Then... doesn't nobody know the truth? Shut your mouth! You are pitiful and pathetic! Your father treated you you well... You, who are his son, whose side are you taking? If you something like that again, remember that I will live the rest of my life without ever seeing your face again. Me, too... I also hope that it isn't. I also hope that it isn't. If Mother, you are such an evil person... I think I will really go crazy! Who told him that? Who on earth? By any chance? Alright, I'll open it for you. You bought the tofu and scallion, right? Wait... What are you doing here? I told you that it was enough. I told you that if you provoke me again that I will not let you go either. What on earth are you doing? I guess rich people like you don't think twice before committing an audacity. How dare you come here and act violent? Act violent? What about you probing and prodding our family? Stop with the lame excuse and get out of this house immediately. Do you think I bore it because I didn't know? I can make you fall anytime. Tell me... What did you tell my son after meeting him? After doing that, did you think that you would still be safe? What on earth are you saying? Why would I meet your son? Are you going to play innocent till the end? Why would I meet your son? Are you going to play innocent till the end? I asked you to please let us live quietly. I said that I would forget everything that has happened. I asked you to please let us live quietly. I said that I would forget everything that has happened. Why are you meeting Ji Ho and why on earth would you tell him that it is an unfair false charge and something like that? What is so unfair? What do you mean Ji Ho? What on earth are you saying? Why is the door open? Da Mi, what are you doing here? Da Mi... do you know this person? Mom, she is Ji Ho's mother. What? Ji Ho... Ji Ho is... her son? This woman... is Da Mi, your mother? Hong Da Mi... Hong Da Mi... is Hong Soo Pyo's daughter? The girl that In Ha and Ji Ho liked was Hong Soo Pyo's daughter! That makes no sense. How can something like this happen? I need to think... to think. That man also died in the accident. Then... Isn't it that nobody knows the truth? Yes! Before Ji Ho begins to suspect me further... I need to shut that mouth first. I must end it all here. President, what brings you all the way here? Tomorrow... I must expose everything. Tomorrow? Hand over all the documents prepared so far to the police. And this... circulate it to the reporters. There is no more time to delay. I understand. I am sorry. Suddenly, an important guest came. So... what was it that you wanted to say? The plan that Keum Dan Construction has and the recorder that you have.. I asked for us to trade the two. Are you going to have that precious information for free? Do you think a negotiation like that will succeed? Go back. Aren't you curious about Keum Dan Construction's plan? I don't think it will be too late for you decide after hearing it out. No matter how big it may be, it won't be equivalent to that of Boosung. If you think that in order to get some money, I was playing house, it is a misjudgment. I am sorry but what to do? I heard that most of the shares you have are concentrated in Boosung Constructions. In a few days, those stocks could become a mere scrap of paper. What do you mean? The 10 billion won construction costs for the Incheon apartment construction will all return as promissory notes on the same day. But... I know that the payment date was already postponed. All the subcontractors that need to be paid are all Keum Dan Construction people. Didn't you know that? In exactly 3 days, at 10 a.m., with my one call... In exactly 3 days, at 10 a.m., with my one call... Boosung constructions will go bankrupt. Attorney Choi, your entire fortune will disappear altogether. Will you be OK? Woo Ji, you... Now, there isn't a single hole through which you can escape. But one. If you give me the recorder... I will give you time to move your stocks. If you still have no thoughts of handing it to me, it can't be helped. Mom, are you OK? Would you like some more water? The guy that you are meeting... is Boosung Group, Chae Young Rang's son? Yes. I'm sorry that I didn't tell you earlier. I didn't tell you because his background was not at all important to me. Why? Why of all people someone from that family? Why? Why of all people... is it Chae Young Rang... that person's son? Why? Why?? Why are you like this? What is the reason why? Why can't we be if Ji Ho is the son of Boosung Instruments? What are you worried about? Huh? What is the matter? Why is mom like this? Woo Jin! Woo Jin! What do we do about this? Da Mi... Da Mi... she is so pitiful... what do we do? What should be done? Mom, please tell me quickly. I'm feeling insecure. Are you doing this because of Ji Ho's family? Oppa, were you against it for the same reason? Why am I the only one who doesn't know? Can't you go ahead and tell me? Oppa, do you know about it? Then tell me because I need to know also. First, let's let mom get some rest today. Why can't you tell me? Is it something huge that I don't know about? Oppa! Da Mi, let's speak tomorrow. You need to calm down also. I don't know what it is but I am insecure. And I am very scared. I think I will go crazy with fright. It's OK, I'm here. It will all become OK. Tomorrow, this awful ill-fated relationship with you will end. It would have been good if you had just stayed still. Why did you provoke me and chose a bottomless pit on your own? The things that you will encounter in the future is all your doing. It would have been good if you had just stayed still. Why did you provoke me and chose a bottomless pit on your own? The things that you will encounter in the future is all your doing. The person that you are Mother... where is the end of your evilness? Don't push me over the cliff anymore. The last memories of liking you... I don't want it trampled over. Is it alright for me to leave ahead? Is it alright for you to wait alone? You are always heartbroken. You are always in tears. Stop. Stop now. Lean on me if you have any difficulties in the future. I will do everything for you, including your father's share. I am trying to turn away from you now. You promised, OK? That you will always be by my side when I am having trouble. That we will never break up. My feet won't move. Holding on to memories, and even at this moment. I am laughing with happiness. Da Mi... I am laughing with happiness. I am laughing with happiness. What should I do now? Don't love me. Don't wait for me. Seeing you hurt again. Seeing you live (like that) again. It is difficult for me. I can't breathe. I will leave into your memories. So, don't wait for me. Yoo Ji Ho. Who are you? We are the police. You need to accompany us to get investigated. What is the problem? We need to investigate you on embezzling Boosung Group's public funds. Embezzle public funds? Who? Let's talk through the details at the police station. Oppa, what is this? What happened? Oppa! What on earth do you mean by that? Embezzle public funds? I haven't touched a single cent of the company's money. There is clear evidence of you creating slush funds with the company's public funds. Are you still going to play innocent? This doesn't make sense. The large summed bills that were charged in the name of research for the masterpiece piano were all found to be fake bills. Furthermore, your shares for the Culture Foundation were secretly deposited into a Swiss bank account. Yoo Ji Ho, the person who signed this document is you, right? This is a clear insult. I didn't do it. Call my lawyer immediately. I will explain everything. Mom, did you hear? Yoo Ji Ho... Shhh. What are you saying? I can't understand a word you are saying. Now... you are both making things up, right? Everything is the truth. Back then, you were too young... I couldn't tell you everything. I hid it from you because I didn't want to give you pain also. I am sorry. I also remember that dad died in a fire accident. You said that he died trying to save someone. But... what was he falsely charged of? And, what connection does Yoo Ji Ho have to this? Yoo Ji Ho is Chae Young Rang's son. Chae Young Rang is the woman who falsely charged dad. How many times do I have to tell you this for you to believe it? Don't lie! I can't believe what Mother and you are saying. I can't. Da Mi, why would I lie to you? No. I'm going to find out personally. I won't believe a word until I meet him and hear it from his mouth. So, don't say anything more to me. --Da Mi. --Da Mi. I will follow her. Hong Da Mi. Why isn't he answering? I'm scared. Please... Please pick up! Fine. I'll accept the conditions you proposed. If you tell me the Keum Dan Construction plans, I'll give you the recorder. You can't be connected right now, you will be transferred to voice mail... Are you very busy? I want to see you briefly. I must talk to you. I'm going now to the company. As a Result of the Plagiarism Decision Music Society Ousts Famous Composer Yoo Ji Ho! I will go out for awhile. Attorney Choi, take care of the rest. We are going to reveal all the cards we hold entirely at this point. So that, in the most miserable manner he can be knocked out penniless. Don't worry about it, President. Nothing should be done wrong, We need to end it here. Anyway, there won't be a way out. Then, I request. Then, I request. With Yoo Ji Ho's downfall, even yours isn't far off. Anyway, there won't be a way out. Somang (Hope) Orphanage Yes... all I need to do is to check how he is living. If he is working under someone, then I can just send him some rice. Did you look around for him for the past 26 years? That' not it. I am the kids' aunt. His mother died during those years. She brought up the kid in her last moments. Oh, I see. Now that I know, if I can find out his whereabouts, I am planning on taking him under my wings. I see. Here it is. I think the previous director who was here accepted him. It says here that he had his first birthday party here, and then he was adopted. Take a look. Could you tell me the address where he got adopted? Please go ahead. What brings you here? If you came to meet Yoo Ji Ho, he isn't here. No. I came to see you. Me? Why? Did you have to take it that far? I requested so much not to make him get troubled anymore. But why did you that? Isn't it enough that you succeeded in making the masterpiece piano and that you got the company? What are you saying now? You need to explain so that I can understand. I still trusted you. "As a Result of the Plagiarism Decision, Music Society Ousts Yoo Ji Ho?" I thought you had become different. That is why, I tried to become your friend again. Did you have to eventually even take away music from him? You, as a person, are really evil. Mother, do you really plan to take it to the end? You are indicted without (physical) detention for now. They are looking for internal documents concerning the slush funds that yo created by embezzling public funds. They will come to a conclusion soon. You paltry fellow! You made all those fake documents, right? I closed a blind eye to all the things you did so far and forgave you, but you stab a knife in my back? Ah. There is one thing I forgot. You also have the crime of giving the directors bribe in the form of stocks. It won't be easy for you to get out of this. What do you mean bribes? I never did that. What you think is unfair, speak about it in front of the law. Where is my mother? Tell me immediately! You had your first birthday party? Were you really alive under the same sky? In whose house and how did you live? How much you have resented your parents... and lived pitifully! This is the recorder. In order to make President Chae fall, it would be good to use it once properly. If not, it could become a useless thing. I am not that clumsy. President Chae will soon be investigated by the police. Did you come up with measures to take over Boosung Group? I don't think we are close enough to share secrets of that sort. Hoping that each gets what the other wants, let's just part like this. Then, I'll leave first. Why did you come here again? I think I was clear enough. Before you run into Da Mi, please go away. I have something to say to Da Mi. Say what? Da Mi is the most precious younger sister in the world to me. Seeing her getting hurt by the likes of you, I will never see of it. I can't believe what you said. Why do I need to break up with Da Mi because of what you said? I will meet Da Mi and I will listen to it properly from her. I haven't told Da Mi yet who killed your father. So, it is best for both of you to end it here. Please stop saying things like that! It's not like you even have the evidence that my mother did something like that. Fine, if you want to get hurt that badly, it can't be helped. It is cruel, but there is no way but for you to hear it with your own ears and believing it. This is the witness, Lee Dong Yi, who worked as a helper at your home. Lee Dong Yi? I heard the two of them fighting in the study. I wondered what the matter was, and so peeped through the crack in the door... Ma'am pushed the Chairman and he fell down. But, the Chairman's head hit the table... He started bleeding a lot... No. It isn't so. It isn't so. It isn't so! It isn't so! That couldn't be. Ji Ho. Why couldn't I get through to you the whole day? Do you know how worried I've been? Why aren't you looking at me? Let's have a talk. Do you also know everything what my mother and brother are talking about? It isn't the truth, right? It isn't your mother who unjustly and falsely charged my father, right? Tell me that it isn't quickly! Tell me that your family has nothing to do with it. My father didn't die at your home, right? I'm sorry. Why are you sorry? What are you sorry about? I'm scared. Please hold me. Da Mi, I'm sorry. You should have said that it isn't, that it isn't. That there is no relevance. That they are all misunderstandings. That they are all lies. Doesn't it suffice that you got Boosung Group back. Doesn't it suffice that I gave everything to In Ha. But why did you have to do all this? Plagiarism, and embezzlement of public funds... Is there still something left to take away from me? No way... Is it because of that? Because I found out the secret behind dad's death? Yoo Ji Ho. Shut that mouth of yours. If you bring that up once more... I will not leave you alone. No. I will still say it. I will say it even if I die. Why did you kill my father? WHY? I asked you! Why did you kill my father?Z
