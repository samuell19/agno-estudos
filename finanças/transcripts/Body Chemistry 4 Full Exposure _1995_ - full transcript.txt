subtitle by - e i f a n s c l u b - Hey, Freddie! I'm over here. Well, Alan, I think we're finally at the bottom of the whole damn story. I want to get this over with. Let's go back to the court. I gotta hand it to you, Freddie. For a man pulling off a blackmail, pretty nonchalant. The agendas changed, Alan. But I'd hardly call what I'm doing 'blackmail'. What the hell do you call it then? I was trying to get you to live up to your commitment, Alan, but that was before I listened to the rest of the tape. You listened to it. It's not enough you sneak on to my property and then secretly videotape me, you gotta listened to the soundtrack for all the salient details? Video tape? What the hell are you talking about? Stop playing games, Freddie! Did you bring the tape or not? I have something for you to listen to, Alan. Here! What was that? I want the videotape you made of me and her having sex. No, Alan. I can't believe it. Why? I'm not in the mood for your shit, Freddie. I want the tape! Is that what she told you, that I made a videotape? She didn't have to tell me, she showed it to me. I don't have a video, Alan. I don't even know you were screwing her until just now. I have an audio tape. And this. And if you don't stop screwing around and put me back on the project, I'll see to it that you don't produce anything for public service announcement for the rest of your life. You're sick, man. You need help. She kills her lover's, Alan. The goddamn woman is serial killer and we've got to take that evidence to the police. He's dying. Call 911. Stop it, Alan! Everything's gonna be okay. We're gonna be together. We're gonna make the movie just like we planned. You did kill these other men, didn't you? Just like you killed Freddie. Well, they try to leave me. Put down the phone, Alan. I said, put it down! I don't know if you're insane, or just cold-blooded killer. But I do know this, you're not gonna get away with it this time. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, what Ms. Sanders here is trying to do is convince you that my client is guilty of many things. Guilty of being angry, guilty of greed, guilty of being a weak man. And you know what? Ms. Sanders is probably right. He is guilty. Guilty of wanting things that are so far outside of his... grasp. Guilty... of being outraged to society which rewards only the wealthy and the... manipulative. Guilty... of, yes... turned into a bottle, when he felt the mankind rendered him... impotent. And powerless. Except, what Ms. Sanders has failed to do is prove, that Bernard Winslow, is guilty of murder. Failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, that this man committed such a monstrous act. Now, we all know Bernard Winslow, there's a little bit of Bernard in all of us. I mean, who among us is not know what it feels like to be... angry, to be frustrated. To feel powerless. Murder? These feelings do not a cold-blooded killer make. These feelings don't even make us unique. Now, I would venture to say, that district attorney Sanders is the first person to admit the feeling of... envy. Futility. And she is not on trial for murder. Here it comes. So, I beseech you, go into that room, and come back with the only conceivable verdict. Not guilty. Thank you. Has the jury reached a verdict? We have, Your Honor. Well, the defendant please rise. In the case of the People vs Winslow, how find you? Your Honor, in the charge of murder in the second degree, we the jury find the defendant, not guilty. The jury is dismissed. The defendant is free to go. Next case, please. Alright, to a brilliant victory. And a brilliant difference. Well, I couldn't have done it without you. To many more victories and a long and prosperous partnership. Thank you for all your help. Well, I hate to break up the party but since you've been in trial your messages really been stacking up. Your rent a continuance on the broker cases up on Monday and you have a new client coming in at nine o'clock tomorrow. No rest for the wicked. Okay, you start pulling the broker files and I'll returning phone calls. Well, I think we're being asked to leave, partner. Hey, Lane. If this guy home at a reasonable hour, I don't want my partner going down in flames this early in his career. I will. - And nice work. - Thank you. How about we celebrate later? I'll buy you beer. I can't, I haven't seen Amy in weeks. I think I should get home, kiss the wife, and pray she doesn't file for divorce. - Another time. - Sure. Another time. Congratulations. Thanks for putting up with me. Well, you're just lucky that they moved up the release date on the most even. - Been too busy to compain. - Much. Why you and your lovely assistant fighting for life liberty and pursuit of happiness? I'm editing endless pages of historical board on the Civil War. Is this new? It might be. Pretty racist stuff, Mrs. Mitchell. I have to do something to get my husband's attention. Well, maybe we should go upstairs before he comes home. We probably have all night. He's a helpless workaholic. I'll get it. Hello. Hello. - Hello. - Who is it? Hello. I hate that. That's three times today. - Hold, please. Your nine o'clock is here. - Where is Lane? She's on her way. Good morning. Good morning. I'm Simon Mitchell. I'm sorry I'm late. I'm compulsively early. Dr. Claire Archer, call me Claire. - You wanna sit down? - Thank you. My wife Amy is an editor, matches publishing. Swears by your book, was it often? Well, one of the problems with writing an explicit relationship manual for the bedroom is you get quoted at the most inopportune moment. Yes, well, what can we do for you, Dr. Archer? I need counsel. It seems I become the prime suspect in the murder of Alan Clay, you know, the TV producer? I'm sorry I'm late, the traffic was murder. Dr. Archer, this is my legal associate, Lane Goodwin. I prefer we speak in private. Alright, if you don't mind, I'll see you later. No problem. The district attorney seems to think they've uncovered a motive, and an eyewitness that can place me at the scene of Alan's death. Have they? No. They mistaken. But I need you to represent me. Well, unfortunately, Dr.Archer, my calendar is full. I can however refer you to a very confident... No. I'm afraid I don't have the time to take on another trial case right now. Look, I want you. I've never been through anything like this before. I'm..., I'm frightened and... Well, I can trust you. Please, Mr. Mitchell, help me. Dr. Archer. Claire. I've just finished a very lengthy trial proceeding. This is what they gonna do to me. They gonna crucified me in public, regardless I am a innocence. They're gonna destroy my life. You have a reputation for standards and integrity. I need that. Or I've lost before I even begun. Taking on a case like this is a huge commitment. - I'll double your retainer. - It's not about the money. Please, it's my life. I need your help, Mr. Mitchell. Please. Alright, start at the beginning. Okay. Thank you, Simon. I feel so much better knowing you'll be with me. - I'll call you with the arrangements. - Good. That's a lovely perfume, Lane. Gardena? Okay, before you giving me the silent treatment, we're going to trial again. Really? What do we got? Dr. Claire Archer, suspect in the killing of that television producer, Alan Clay. High-profile. I like it. DA says there's a motive and an eye witness that can place with the scene. - What's the motive? - Business deal gone bad. But the witness can be challenged in the motive is circumstantial at best. The DA's searching for something here and I want you to find out what it is. - Has she been charged? - Not yet. I want you to file this firm with the court is her counsel. When they do make a formal charge will arrange for her to turn herself into the State Attorney's office. And then we'll walk through the arraignment. Until then, we got a trial to prepare for. - Did she do it? - She said she didn't. And do you believe she's telling the truth? You never asked me whether believe Bernard Winslow. He wasn't wearing a short skirt. I'm not her judge nor her jury, I'm simply her lawyer. Jurisprudence, Lane. Fourteenth Amendment. Wasn't you who queted, 'No poet ever interprets nature as freely as a lawyer interprets truth'. The truth is, the name is gonna kill me. I'll make sure she gets the good truth. Bail is set at 100.000 dollars. Dr. Archer will relinquish her passport over the bailiff. This case is bound over for trial in the 14th. Hey, Dr. Archer. Can you give us statement? Does it have anything to do with your new book? Will you comment for Channel 3 Action News? My client has no comment this time. She will however says the District Attorney's allegation nothing short of harassment. We have every confidence that this matter will be resolved, early in the procedure. No further comment, Gentleman. No! Excuse me. Excuse me. One last thing... - You alright? - Yeah, thanks. - You handled that very well. - I dance as fast as I could. Thanks for taking care of it so quickly. I think that's most dreadful place I've ever been. That's why I'm here for. Can I... Invite you to dinner or something. It's the least I can do. I, um... I have some paperwork I have to get to. I should get home. I saw some serious apologizing to do to my wife. Another time. Shit. Hello. Simon. Hello? Simon. Simon, it's Claire. I'm sorry to call you so late. It's alright, what's the matter? Simon? What is it? I'm frightened. Why? What happened? Look, I got a call just now. They said... They said what? They said, if I kept you as my council, that there'd be trouble. - Are you sure that what they meant? - Yes, I'm sure it's a warning. Now, did you recognize the voice? No, it was a woman's voice. Listen to me. It sounded like someone trying to stir up some media hype. It happens on high-profile cases like this. You really think so? It happens. We'll file a report in the morning. Until then, pick the phone off the hook, and try and get some sleep. All right. Thank you, Simon. I'm sorry. It's all right. Good night. Simon. Claire. - Good morning. - Morning. I know I'm early. I didn't sleep very well. Guess I'm not as resilient as I thought I was. Would you like to go out for some coffee? Come on. I bet you never get out of the office. All right. Besides, I want to apologize for calling you in the middle of the night, like some scare school girls. Don't worry about it. Hey, Sandra. Have you heard from him? I call this a/c left over an hour ago. It's not like him to be this late. Now this could definitely give a whole new meaning to the term, hung jury. Morning, ladies. Where have you been? Do I detect a note of indignation in that question? You were supposed to be here an hour and a half ago to go over the Archer case. Claire and I met over breakfast. Sort of. Why didn't you tell me? I wasn't aware I had to clear my schedule with you. Simon, you know what I mean. How am I supposed to stay ahead of this case if I'm excluded from every meeting? Claire is a bit uncomfortable talking in front of anyone else. No. Claire is about to have the most intimate details of her life spilled to a court room full of people. She's a trained psychologist, Simon. She's manipulating you. She's not manipulating anyone. Look, sometimes paranoia is justified. The woman is being persecuted by the district attorney's office over something that should've been written off the books 20 minutes after happened. Don't you think that attitude is just... little naive? I am part of your defense team. I'm not the enemy. And stop acting like it. Are you attracted to her? She's a very attractive woman. Now, do you have the broker deposition? Yes, Sir. I'll get it. Hey, what's with you tonight, huh? Hello? Pay attention, Amy! Things are going to get ugly. Who is this? Alright. Let's go over what you got again. Okay. Let's see. The eyewitness is a Guatemalan housekeeper, she was working for the next door neighbors at the time, filling in for their regular nanny. It seems she didn't come forward because of a problem with the INS. Although the DA has offered her immunity. She does not speak English very well and she could not have been closer than a few hundred yards. Motive? Alan Clay was making a movie based on Claire Archer's life. Prosecution has several strong statements from Studio employees that Dr. Archer was bitterly opposed to the content of the script, and the so-called free liberties that having Clay and Freddie Summers are taking the facts. That's not for liable suit, not for murder. Unless, somebody dug too deep. And exhumed something about Dr. Archer sure she doesn't want anyone to know. D.A. gotta have something else up on his sleeve. If we're gonna do anymore tonight, how about I go next door and pick us up some dimsum? We might as well. We're going to court with this in two days and have yet to prepare an opening statement. - I'll be right back. - Okay. This was shut to the mail slot. I will be back in few minutes. Be sure to get lots of hot mustard. I forget they're closed on Mondays. - What's on the tape? - Nothing. - Nothing important. - Are you okay? Yeah, it's just been a long day. What if we pick this up tomorrow? Sure. Simon, you're pale. Are you sure you're okay? Yeah, I just need a good night's sleep. Okay, you go ahead, I'll refile this stuff. Good night. Simon. I thought you might be working late. You were..., you startled me. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to frighten you. It's alright. What are you doing here? Well, I was in the neighbor..., no. I have to go to the governor's party and... I hate going to the things alone. I didn't have a date, I thought maybe... I could talk to you into the job. I've gotta... I gotta be... at home. You know, there's a room full of potential clients, just waiting for you there. Hi. Where have you been? What's the matter? Where have you been? Well, I was at the office, working on the Archer's defense. What's the matter with you? I called you. Twice. Why didn't you answer the phone? Well, the switchboards off. I probably don't see the phone flashing. Yeah, I tried to call you too. Why is the phone off the hook? Someone called. I was afraid that they would call back with another threat. - Wait, what kind of a threat ? - Something about things turning ugly. You sure it wasn't wrong number? They called me by my name. - Is it a man or a woman voice? What? - They're whispering. I don't know. It was a whisper. Honey. The dog was barking and then I thought I heard someone. Why don't you ever here when I need you? We'll change the phone number. We'll file a police report. I don't want to file a damn report. I want my husband home at night. I want to feel safe in my home. Instead just spent all your night alone with her in that office. She's just very demanding of my time. Simon, she works for you, not the other way around. We got a very heavy caseload right now. I just, every once in a while, I would like if you spent an evening alone with me. Sometimes I don't even know what goes on in your life anymore. - Just jealous wife things... - No, you dont. Every time I want to talk to you about something you don't wanna talk about, you do that. Eventually things will settle down we'll be able to spend some more time together. You have been promising me... a vacation for a year now. How long do I have to wait before it's my turn? How long does eventually equal? Masters has offered me a new book. A dealer. Since it doesn't seem to be a vacation in the near future. I'm gonna take it. Good morning. I know I'm early. I'll just wait if you don't mind. Wait. Yes, Mr. Mitchell's office. Simon in yet? No. He called and he said he was going to the courthouse, to drop something off to judge Hibbert. But his favorite client is here. You let her in his office? I tried to stop her. We'll handle this. Excuse me. Mail is usually considered a private matter. Just my nature to be curious. It's my nature to be suspicious. You think I killed him, don't you? Doesn't really matter what I think. I think... you and your high moral horse would sell a client down the river, if you thought it was in the name of justice. The law and justice are not the same thing. Justice is for God. Then my guilt... or innocence, shouldn't be of any concern to you. Someone once said, a jury is made up of 12 people, brought together to decide who has the best lawyer. I hired the best. Simon doesn't really like anyone in his office when he's not here, so... perhaps you could wait in the lobby. You really take good care of him, don't you? You know, he's very fortunate, to have someone fawning over him the way you do. I beg your pardon? I watched you two together, it's sort of a maternal, love slave despiteful thing happening. Only he doesn't know what men seldom do. Excuse me? You have a crush, how cute. You know, there's a whole chapter in my book called a parent sexual obsession. - You should read it. - You don't know anything about me. Don't I? All those late nights at home alone. I bet you know what kind of food he likes, his neck size, what kind of magazines he reads. Stop it. You've even pictured yourself in bed with him, haven't you? And fucking you until he begs for more. Promising to leave his wife if only you - go down on him one more time. - Go to hell. It would ruin everything if he knew. And don't worry. your secret's safe with me. By the way, you'll never guess who's gay. I'll call you back. Lane? Please tell Simon that I waited, and he can call me at home. And you should see your co-worker. She just suddenly became distorted and ran out of the room. Thanks, Dr. Archer. I will. Sanders. Good morning. You're looking lovely as usual. Save the charm for the jury. That was sincerity? Not as much as I doubt you morality. Morality? Everyone is entitled to the best defense possible, so it's nothing personal. You bring in Archer with a plea of guilty, and I'll drop the charge from murder one to manslaughter two. If you had anything you wouldn't be offering. This isn't a game, Mitchell. She's a manipulator. Maybe more personal than you think. My client is innocent. Then I guess it's just your intelligence that I doubt. See you in court, Counselor. You're leaving? Yeah. Claire and I gonna work at her house today. - Really? - Yes, really. Have you seen the police files? Simon, this is ridiculous. Lane, I go to trial tomorrow, I need you to stay here and prepare the witness interrogatories. I've done that. Then do it again. I can't afford any mistakes. Perhaps it's not my mistake if you're concerned about it. Lane, what the hell is wrong with you? For the past two weeks, you've been nothing but adversarial to me. No, I do not have the time, nor the energy to deal with your temper tantrums or your petty jealousies or whatever the hell it is that's bothering you about this case. How dare you talk to me like that. If you can't deal with the client, then take some time off. Go home. Take your vacation time. I'll handle this myself. You can't just dismiss me like that. You depend on me for every little thing. You'd be lost without me and you know it. I am perfectly capable of handling my own affairs. Poor choice of words. What was that supposed to mean? Whatever you think it means. Claire. You here? Claire. Claire. Claire. - The door was open. - I know. I left it open for you. We better get to it. Would like to drink or something before we start? No, thanks. Damn. Lane didn't get me the police files. I got a lot lot of work to do. I have every confidence in you. You're the best. I hope that's enough. Claire. Last night someone dropped off a tape in my office. It was a video of you and... Alan Clay. Did you watch it? It's quiet... explicit. Do you have any idea who might have dropped off that tape or why? I did. Why? You said you wanted to know everything. Thought I can help. Help? If the jury... Use that tape, they'll think it's an illicit affair. They cost you points. If the DA gets a hold of it, it will be construed as motive. A love tryst gone awry. It was more than that. Alan and I were in love. Prosecution is trying to establish... a third person on the tennis court that evening. If they can prove that it was you, you become the prime suspect. Unless, we can determine that there's someone else with the motive. Freddie Summers, was using the affair against Alan. Alan called his bluff. Do you know someone named... Bob Sibley? Yes. He was, um... head of the network where Alan worked. Why? Prosecution call him as a witness. Did he know about you and Alan? I don't know. Maybe. I wish you told me about this sooner. I'm sorry. I just showed you the tape, because I... I thought you should know everything. Claire, your life is on the line. I can't afford any surprises from the D.A.. You know, I was... actually afraid to let you see the tape. I didn't want you to think of me... you know, with him. It's not my job as your attorney to judge you. What about as a man? - - e - e i - e i f - e i f a - e i f a n - e i f a n s - e i f a n s c - e i f a n s c l - e i f a n s c l u - e i f a n s c l u b - e i f a n s c l u b - Simon. Sandra, hold my calls. Simon. You got a minute? Oh yeah, I got a minute. I'm going to trial in the morning and I'm completely unprepared. My client is full of surprises and Lane picked this particular time to go insane. Yeah, I got a minute. Lane came into my office earlier, ranting and raving that you having an affair. With one of our clients. Is that true? No. Lane is acting like a possessive child, she has a problem with Dr. Archer ever since she walked in the door. Good. Until you're too smart for them, that you never have an affair with a client. Good luck in court. Good afternoon, Atlantic broadcasting. Hello, I'd like to speak to Bob Sibley, please. One moment. Mayor. Mayor. Mayor. Mayor. Hallo. I want you, Amy. Now, things are gonna get worse. Who is this? Who is this? No. No. I don't think anything's missing. Place is just messed up. Look. Do you know what time Lane left the office? She left right after you did. No. She didn't say. No, as a matter of fact, she didn't even say that she was leaving. She just ran out and a half. - Why? What's wrong? - No, it's nothing. Look, don't say anything about this to anybody else, alright? And I'll be back in the office later. Bye. Lane did this, didn't she? - Of course not. - Why not? You said she was angry with you. You said she was acting crazy. That's not what I meant. Simon, who else could have done this besides Lane? I don't know. Lane has access to the alarm code. The police said there no was force entry, why don't you at least say that it could have been her? I couldn't. Lane has been my sister for three years. I can't accuse her something like that, it's unthinkable. She's jealous, Simon. Please. She's obsessed with you, she feels rejected and she's acting irrationally upset. It's not so unthinkable. If you don't see that, then you're totally oblivious. Which isn't so unthinkable either sometimes. Maybe you should do your homework. Read your clients chapter of obsessive and violent behavior. Mr. Mitchell, it was so late, I didn't think that you'd be back. Should I stay? No. I'm going home. I'm just picking up some files. Is everything alright? Yeah. Everything is fine. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Hi, Simon. What are you doing here? You know, you left so quickly this afternoon. I just wanted to make sure everything was alright. No. Everything's not alright. I made a mistake, Claire. I should never have let things go as far as they have. This is the very least, unethical and it has to stop. Now. I love my wife. Simon, you just can't switch off something this passionate. I can. And I will. Our encounters can't be a professional level, And I will remove myself in this case. No, you're not walking out on me. You're not gonna leave me. You're not gonna leave this trial. If you try to withdraw from this case, I'll make sure everyone knows you've been fucking me. Including the wife you love so much. You're the best defense attorney money can buy. And if you jeopardize this trial anyway, if you blow this case, I'm taking you down with me. If you don't believe it, there's a little late night viewing, you've never been better. My God. I can't believe you do this. You know you want me and I want you. You can't resist. I can't. I can't do this. You can't not. Simon. Remember this? Simon. Simon. You're not as responsive as you were in the tape. Let me refresh your memory. Simon. Simon. - Simon, I phoned you, saw your lights out. - Yeah, I was just getting a cup of coffee. - Can I talk to you about that Friedman case? - That's was seven months ago. Yeah, I know, but... Just drop the technical jargon and speak English. Well, I did what you asked, I enhanced a digital quality of the 911 tape. I ran through every equalizer gain amplifier I've got. That is definitely a woman's voice on the tape, but she's standing too far away from the receiver, and there's too much distortion to get a positive ID. I don't believe this. You promised me that there wasn't going to be a problem. Now, in one hour, I'm gonna walk into that courtroom with one piece of real evidence that I've got, and now you're telling me that I've got nothing? Now, unless I come up with something real fast, that judge gonna throw me and this entire case right out the window. I'm sorry. I really thought I could get a voice printed. But it's cordless phones too much distortion. Keep trying. I'm not in the mood for your shit, Freddie. I want the tape. Is that what she told you, that I made a video tape? She didn't have to to tell me. She showed it to me. I don't have a video, Alan. I didn't even know you were screwing her until just now. I have an audio tape. And this. Hey, let's don't go fucking nuts on me, man, just cause you got kicked off a movie. I don't care about the movie. Claire Archer is a murderer. She killed my friend. She killed the radio station manager and she set up the other guy for the cops to kill. You're sick, man. You need help. She kills her lovers, Alan. The goddamn woman is serial killer. We've got to take that evidence to the police. Call your first witness, Counselor. Your Honor, the people call Hugh Miner. Rise your right hand. Do you swear, to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, - so help me God. - I do. Mr. Miner. Could you please tell the court what you do? I'm criminologist and an audio specialist with the Los Angeles Police Department. Your Honor, at this time the people would like to submit into evidence, a 911 tape, taken from police records, containing a call from the claim residents. The evening of June 11th the night in question. Your Honor, counsel for the defense would like to stipulate, that we have no knowledge of any tape. Nor have we been given an opportunity to review this material. Your Honor, this tape was just made available to us. So noted. I don't like surprises. What's on the tape? I have no idea. On the night, that Alan Clay and Freddie Summers were killed, Alan Clay dialed 911, from a cordless phone on the tennis court. Your Honor, I would like to play the contents of that tape for the court. Objection. Motion to suppress. Your Honor, the tape just simply proves that there was a third party on the tennis court on the evening of the 11th. In the essence of time, I'll allow the tape. But if I find it misleading... I'll strike it from evidence. 911. State your emergency. You did kill these other men, didn't you? - Put down the phone, Alan. - Just like you killed Freddie. I said put it down. I don't know if you're insane, or just cold-blooded killer. But I know do know this, you're not gonna get away with it this time. Mr. Miner. Can you identify the male voice on that tape to be that of Alan Clay? Yes, the voice on the tape is definitely that of Alan Clay's. And the other voice. The woman voice. Could that be the voice of Claire Archer? Objection. It could be anyone's voice. Thank You, Counselor. Objection sustained. Ms. Sanders, you'll direct your land of question to the facts, not... - speculation. - Yes, Your Honor. Mr. Miner. Despite the quality of the tape, you can however conclude, that there was a woman, on the tennis court with Alan Clay, at the time of the call, can you not? There is definitely a woman in proximity at the time the call was made, yes. Thank you. I have no further questions for this witness at this time, I would however like to recall him at a later time. Does the defense wish to cross-examine? Yes, Your Honor. Mr. Miner, am I to understand that you can positively identify Alan Clay's voice on the tape, but not that of the third party? - That's correct. - Why is that, Sir? The third party was too far away from the phone receiver to get a clear voice print. However, we can determine it was definitely a woman. So, with all the high-tech audio enhancement at your disposal, is there any way possible, to distinguish the third voice on the tape? Not this time. There's too much distortion. Thank you. No further questions. The witness is excused. You may step down. The people call Bob Sibley to the stand. Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God. I do. Mr. Sibley. According to a sworn statement made by you, you explain that Alan Clay and Claire Archer were in a bitter feud, over the contents of TV movie script on Dr. Archer's life. Is that correct? Bitter feud? Did I say that? I must have misunderstood your question. Alan and Claire had a... disagreement over some scripted dialogue, was more like... an artistic difference between two colleagues. It's hardly what your statement reflects. I just told you, I may have misunderstood you question. Do I need to remind you, Mr. Sibley, that you are under oath? No, Counselor. You don't. In your statement, you said that Alan Clay and the writer Freddie Summers came to you with a script. Based on a private investigator's journal, and diary of Dr. Archer's prior involvement with the two associates who are now dead. - Is that true? - Objection. Your Honor, I simply trying to establish that this is materially Dr. Archer did not want in the public eye. Overruled. Watch your wording, Ms. Sanders. Did you tell Freddie Summers to destroy that material? Well, I never actually read any journals or diaries. The material that I referred to was the... written script. It just plain stunk. Did you or did you not say, that the original Summer's script, contained accounts that would have condemned and ruin Dr. Archer's career? Well, it had nothing to do with the story. What it was about was just bad writing. If we use it, it would run all of our careers. Your Honor. I think that this witness has been coerced. Objection. The DA has no foundation for that kind of allegation. The sign is the witness contradicting his earlier deposition. More like manipulating it. Your Honor. Perhaps you should have been more specific in your line of questioning. Sustained. Then I have no further questions. You are dismissed. The people call Faye Gutierez to the stand. Your witness, Counselor. Ms. Gutierez. A few moments ago you pointed out my client, Dr. Archer, identifying her as the person you saw on the patio on the evening of question. Si. Yes. Dr. Archer is a very pretty woman, don't you think? Yes, Sir. Very pretty woman. Have you ever met Dr. Archer before, I mean, before that evening? - No. - Have you met the Clays before? No. No. Do you see the woman sitting in the gallery directly behind me? Mrs. Sibley. I ask Fran Sibley to rise. Objection, Your Honor. These people have nothing to do with the eyewitnesses account. - Mr. Mitchell, are you coming to a point? - Yes, Your Honor. Then, get there. Mrs. Sibley. Have you ever seen this woman before? No. Now, from the upstairs window of the house where you were working, to the patio is roughly... 200 yards, I said. Do you agree? I don't know. Maybe so. Objection. The witness can't be expected to know the distance between houses. Your Honor, for the sake of the court, the distance is exactly 202 yards. Noted. Move on. Ms. Gutierez. Was it safe to say, the distance between where you are sitting, and where I'm standing is a fraction of the distance between two houses ? Not so far. No. Now, at one point on the evening of the 11th, Fran Sibley and Bev Clay were both on the tennis court of the play residents. Now, can you tell me from where you're sitting, beyond a shadow of a doubt, which of these women you saw on the tennis court? Objection. Your Honor, the witness is already identified the suspect. Your Honor, if Ms. Gutierez cannot distinguish between these women at the back of the courtroom, how can she possibly identified my client at three times the distance and fading light? Overruled. Ms. Gutierez, you may answer the question. Ms. Gutierez. Can you positively identify the woman you saw on the tennis court that evening? It's alright, Ms. Gutierez. It'll be nearly impossible to do so. No further questions. The witness is excused, this court will stand in recess until 10 AM tomorrow. Why did you do that? What? Do what? Alter yor statements. Franny, leave it alone, huh. Don't walk away from me. You're not telling me something. I want to know what it is. Why would you risk perjury? Fran, the DA misconstrued my statement. And that's all. That is a lie. You and I are not stupid people. We both know more than we would ever admit. I know you have lied to me about a thousand times, but don't lie to me now. Did you sleep with Claire Archer? No, I didn't. You're always so convincing. Even when deep down inside I know the truth. Funny. I think I prefer it, when you lie to me. Simon. Wait. You were great in there. I seem to have some help. Claire. No, please. No. Claire, no. I am not not gonna take no for an answer. 911. State your name and emergency. Hello, this is Dr. Claire Archer. I'd like to report a break-in, please. - Simon. - Yeah. Simon. Hey. You wipe your feet all over the prosecution's case, so you should be looking a lot happier. I made a mistake, Derrick. Everybody makes mistakes. Nothing is immutable. This might be. So then you apologize and you move on. It's not that simple. She's guilty, Derrick. Simon, look. You are criminal defense attorney. Has it never occurred to you before that any of your clients might be guilty? Of course, it has. Just not this one. She maneuvered me like a rat through a maze. Well, you're not the first one of us to get caught with his pants down around his knees. I let you know a little secret. Most attorneys to give their eyeteeth for a smart client. Don't you feel a moral obligation? No. It's not my job. And it's not your job either. Let me give you some advice. If you sense that this woman guilt, in any way can jeopardize this law firm, I strongly urge that you excuse yourself from this case. Now, you understand? I wish I could. Amy Mitchell. Hey, babe. How late you gonna work? I almost done in here. Your ears must have been burning, I was just talking about you. Yeah? All good I hope. You'll never guess, who's sitting across from me right now discussing her new book. I give up. Claire Archer. Claire. Where is she? Can I talk to her? Well, you talked to her all day honey, it's my turn. Baby, just let me just speak to her for just one moment. Okay. Simon. What the hell do you think you're doing? You know, your wife is every bit as charming as you said she was. I'm sure we'll get along just fine. - Claire, for God's sake... - Bye bye, Simon. Listen honey, I've already eaten, so pick yourself up something on the way home, okay? Alright. Fine. Mayor. Mayor. Hi, honey. Who's that? Daddy? Amy, it's important. I have to talk to Simon. Simon doesn't want to talk to you, Lane. Go away. I'm not letting you in the house. It is a matter of life and death. Let me in right now. You've caused enough trouble, Lane. Go away or I'm calling the police. I don't know what you're talking about. His life is in danger. Let me in. Simon isn't here. Now, stop threatening us. I mean it, Lane. Amy. Please, listen to me. You don't understand. I said I mean it, Lane. Mayor needs water. What's the matter? I smell gas. Oh, my God. In here. No, don't turn on the light. Is there anything on? - Everything's gonna be fine. - It's not fine. Call the police, Simon. God, I can't believe she did this. I told you she was crazy, she could have killed us all. - It's not Lane. - Of course it's Lane. What is the matter with you, Simon? Why don't you just admit that she's a sick woman before it's too late. Ms. Sanders, I need to talk to you. Aren't you Simon Mitchell's legal associate? Yes. I'm sorry. I can't talk to you. Ms. Sanders. I can give you Claire Archer on a platter. In private. Let's come in. Thought I'd find you here. You weren't in your office. You wouldn't be trying to avoid me now, would you? You can't very well do that. You're my client. I need to confer with my attorney. Is there some place we can go? Fine. I wanted to be with you so bad last night. I couldn't think of anything else. You could have killed me and my wife. I wanted to make sure you didn't have second thoughts about our relationship. You made that clear. You shouldn't be in here. Come on, there's not gonna be anyone here, for at least an hour. Do I have to remind you how persuasive I can be? It's all there. Claire Archer left a path of destruction in her wake. There enough dead lovers here from her past to fill a cemetery. But there's no proof that. No, but Freddie Summer's journal and files about her life, are more than enough motive for murder. But it's not enough to get a conviction. There's more. Taped phone threats. There are records of her activities two months prior to the death of a psychologist at UCLA. There are pictures and phone records and dates. She is sick. She's like a spider. She lures into her web and then she devours. I can't take this from you. I shouldn't even be talking to you. I could be disbarred. Nobody knows I have this. No one will ever have to know where it came from. If you take this, she's gonna walk, and you know it. Alright. Alright. I'll have my associate examine these in camera, but I have to know why are you doing this? Because... Alan Clay will be your last victim. You have to stop her before she does it again. I'm taking huge risk. I just hope it's worth it. Court is now in session. The Honorable Judge James Hakama presiding. Your Honor, we've had some new and important evidence come to life. We would like to request a recess in order to evaluate the material. Your Honor, defense request documentation of any new findings. Very well. This court will stand in recess until 10 AM Monday morning, at which time the court will consider new evidences. This court adjourn. Do you know what they got? I have no idea. Why don't you ask your little assistant? - Simon. - Lane. Where are you? What have you done? I did what had to be done. I mean, you've got to tell me. You don't know what's at stake here. You've got to lose this one, Simon. Trust me. Lane. You talked to the prosecution, didn't you? I consider this an enormous the trails, Simon. - Claire. - Simon? Simon is that her? Is she there? Hang up the phone. Simon. What is happening? How could she knows? How could she knows? Where do you think you're going? My wife and I are staying with a friend until after the trial. You're running out of me, Simon. I don't like that. Then I'm going to the judge and have myself removed from the case. I don't think so. There is nothing you can say to threaten me. I've deceived my wife and betrayed my profession. Why are you doing this to us? There is no us, Claire. There never was. This is just a... This is just bad error in judgment by a very weak man. You have any idea what you're giving up here? I've arranged so we both come out of this virtually unscathed. You know, I knew you'd let me down. You mean arranged. Lane. She's so... gullible. You set her up. My God, you set us all up. You know, I really thought you could have been the one. Simon. Simon. Are you alright? Simon. Oh, God. Simon. Amy. No. The counsels approach the bench. Is there any way to straighten out of this mess? Your Honor. prosecution's evidence is totally inadmissible. Ms. Sanders, how did you come by this material? It was supplied by reliable informant, Your Honor. The material evidence that was presented to the district attorney's office, Your Honor. Was confiscated, through an illegal break in a burglary at the home of my client. And I have a detailed report here. Please note, that it is dated last Wednesday. I will ask you again, how did stolen material come to be in your hands, Counselor? I am not at liberty to say, Your Honor, but I had no idea it was stolen. Your Honor, the material was given to the DA's office, by a disgruntled employee of our law firm. Ms. Sanders, does the District Attorney's office have any further evidence against Dr. Archer other than what we've seen? No, Your Honor. Step back. District Attorney Sanders, I should cite you for malfeasance. In light of the circumstances brought to the attention of this court, the evidences, submitted by the prosecution was obtained by any illegal search and seizure. And an unlawful ex parte communication, between the district attorney's office and a member of the defense team. And it is therefore inadmissible. Since the prosecution has failed to come up with further evidence against Dr. Archer, and in light, of the extenuating circumstances, this case is dismissed, with prejudice. The defendant is free to go. subtitle by - e i f a n s c l u b -
