We're back from the hunt. Tell the butcher. Sort out those horns and put them on the table. And get the blood off these horns. You know the dogs will smell them at Customs. - They've got to be clean. - You got it, boss. - Ah, this side is messy. - Yep. Got the kill shot... Oh, yeah, messy. Head, claws, and hide? - Same, same. - Got it. - Now. - Another hunt later? Some Americans in an hour. So which one do you want? Uh, boss, which one do you want? Mm... They want a male, so, uh... this one, number seven. Time's up, Donnie. Oh, yeah. Gonna run out if this keeps up. Ah, so what? We can get more. - Hmm. - Business is good. We can get more, right, boss? Oh, yeah. Put it on the flame, boys. These are ready for shipping. Put them with the others. Ready. Move, move. Go. Come on. Quick, quick! Pull! - She's heavy. - Pull. Send another. Come on, come on. Move! Come on! Get up! Get down! She's in. - Got it, boss. - That's it. Right there. Keep to it. Keep still. Pull it up. She's down! Come on, move! Hey, hey! I don't think she's dead! Get out of there! She's not dead. What the fuck is going on in there? I've told you both before, don't... Hey. Hey, come on. - Where are the rhino horns? - Here. And the ivory you asked for. Where are the rhino horns? There's no rhinos. You killed them all, man. How many guards are inside? At least four. Rogue One for Rogue Two. Send sitrep. Good to go, boss. Stand by. Copy you. Standing by. Just a quick job, she said. Just a snatch and grab, she said. What do you want? I wanna get paid and get out of here. I got places to be. Oh, you owe money again, Joey? So it's a girl this time, huh? Or a boy. I-I don't judge. I don't judge. Your fireworks are ready and set. How you wanna do this? Sunset's in an hour. I say we sit tight and then... boom! Why does everything always have to be so noisy around you? You know, a girl's gotta make an entrance. Hm? Hm? Hm? Be aware that the asset is in the green hut. Green hut. Solid copy. ♪ Am I original ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ ♪ Am I the only one? ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ ♪ Am I sexual? ♪ Why do you like that song so much? I don't, it's a fucking earwig. I hate it. But it keeps me awake when I'm hanging out with you. You have a beautiful singing voice. You need to read this, boss. Shit! Okay, we go now. What now? What happened to dark? There's no time. They're moving the asset. Pata, are you sure about this building? I think so. You think so, or you know so? The difference can mean all of our lives. That is what my contact told me. Ahem. Mm... I love this bit. Water! Get the water! Get the water! Water! Get ammo! Get the fucking ammo! Quickly. Come on, move! Who the fuck did these smokers? Stop fucking up! Come on! Come on! Put the fire out! Okay, on three. On three, or three, two, one, go? Elijah, every time? It's funny. Every time. Come on. Three, two, one. - Shit! - Shit! Wrong building. There's nothing here. What the fuck? Pata, this is not how you fucking make amends. They told me it's this building. What do you want us to do, boss? It's gotta be that one, right? It's gotta be. That's a lot of open ground to clear. Rogue Two, I'm gonna need you to draw their fire. - Send again, boss. - You got to piss them off so bad they shoot at you. - Copy? - Solid fucking copy. You know this is stupid, right? Yeah. We do stupid very well. Yes, we fucking do! What the fuck? Shit! What the fuck's going on? Give me the gun! Give me the gun! Come here! Ding dong! - Fuck you! - Moving! - It's very painful. - Good. Boss, this could get messy. I like messy. Yeah, we got 'em, We got 'em up here, boss. - On three. - On three or three, two, one? - Elijah! - Go! Clear! Clear! Put the fucking guns down. Who's guarding the girls? Over here! Come here! You're fucking missing them, man! - Shoot him! - Cover me! Moving, moving! Shoot him! Shoot the bad guys! Shoot them so I don't have to! Fuck! - Over here! - Over... Hey! You wanna take what's mine, yeah? Hey! Hey! Over here! Well, we'll see about that. - Yes! - Fuck, what is this? They're trafficking girls. Please! Please! Please! Please! We'll help you, don't worry. Open the door! You can open the door! - You can open the door! Please! - No, not you. Hey, girl! Girl! What's your name? Asilia Wilson. Bingo! She's the money. Light them up, boys! No, get back! - Get down! Secure her. - She said don't move. Rogue One to Rogue Three, we're ready for extraction. Copy you. Inbound. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What about the others? - They're not part of the plan. - Sam! You just said we gotta move. That'll just slow us down. We don't have room in the vehicles. - Rogue One for Rogue Three. - Sam! Hey! Fucking don't make me pull rank on you, Eli! This is not about rank. We didn't fucking plan for this! We're not getting paid for this! - Come on! - Sam! We're not getting paid for this. Please, somebody! Just help me! Please! What the fuck?! Please! Please! Please! Please! I'm begging you! If I fucking die because I'm doing the right thing, I'm gonna be so pissed. Fuck it, do it! Light 'em up! - Get me a motor car! - Hey, over here! When you want them to shoot, they don't shoot. Go! Go! Burn these fuckers up! Go! Burn these fuckers to death! Get in there! Well, we ain't leaving this fucking way! We need a back door! Everybody duck! Pull back! Stay down! They set the building on fire! They're fuckin' holding. Sit down! Sixty seconds out. Where are you? We're fucked! We're fucked! We're all gonna burn! What kind of rescue is this? Nobody fucking sent anybody to rescue you. Seconds away. Where do you want us? Second building. Low bungalow, south side. Back door. There's no back door in building two! There will be. - Move! - Listen to me, come here! Come here, now! Shh, it's gonna be okay. All right? I want you to cover your ears and open your mouth. - What? Why? Why? - Hey! Unless you wanna blow out your lungs and your fucking eardrums, you're gonna do what I say. You're gonna blow up the room? No, just the wall. Get down. Fire in the hole! Go around the back! Around the back! Come on! Hurry, hurry! Get in, get in! I thought there was only one hostage! It's an evolving situation. Come on! Let's go, go, go! - How many we got? - It's a "rescue one, get three" kinda deal. Let's get the fuck outta here! Go, go, Bobbie! Go, go, go, go, go! Hey! You, man. Come! Go get the truck! Come on! Let's go, let's go! Don't go, my legs are shorter than you! Let's go! Let's go! Open that fucking gate! - Come on! - Get in! Get in! Get in! Light 'em up! Someone order an Uber? - Too soon? - Yeah. Rogue One for Osprey. Over. Go for Osprey. Sitrep. We've got the package plus two, and we're three minutes from the extraction point. I repeat, three minutes. Over. Unit copy. Three minutes to extraction. Boss! Theyre sending more! - We need to lose these guys! - I'm on it! I'm on it! Hold on! Take stuff from me, eh? Company, company, company! I'm coming for you! They're shooting on the left! Come on! I got Osprey! - Chopper's up! Chopper's up! - Yes! Give me the RPG! Quick! Quick! Give me the RPG! Give me it! Fuck! - RPG! - Take him out! Take him out! I've got him! I've got him! I don't got him! Oh... Shit! - No, no, no, no, no! - Osprey! RPG fired! Pull up! Pull up, Osprey! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck you! Open fire, open fire! To the left! To the left! Stick with me. Don't worry. It's not that bad. It's gonna be... Let me see. Oh, yeah, they shot him. Joey! Calm her the fuck down! - Hey! What's your name? - Chloe. Chloe? Chloe, that's a beautiful name. Now look, I know you're scared, and I know you're frightened, but you need to calm down for all of us. The cavalry's, uh... Well, the cavalry's gonna come back. Shut up. Bobbie! Elijah! Take over! - Fuck! - Hometown advantage! I got this! Keep firing! Just keep them off us! Keep firing! Grenade out! Grenade out! Grenade out! - Joey, grenade! It's hot. - Thank you. See you later, assholes! These wheels are done. Fuck! All right, we gotta move. - Out! Out! Out! - Move, move, move! Come with me. Come with me. Cover me! - Moving! - Move! Covering! Covering! Michael, you good? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Down! Down, down. Ah, shit! It's hot. - Incoming! - We got to jump. Looks good to me. Move! We're gonna have to jump. What? No, we can't! No, we can't! It's not deep enough. It's deep enough. Oh, my God! That's no way of telling! Hey! Do you want to take a fucking stand here? Because we're gonna die. Bo, you good? - I'm running... - Change! Come on, come on, come on. There you go. We can't! This is my last one! We need a plan! Hey, boss! What's the plan? - Fuck. - Sam, what are we doing? - What are we doing? - Take out your plates. - Get rid of your longs. - Keep it down! Keep it down! Anything that's gonna drag you down. - We have to jump! - There's no way! We're losing our longs? Losing our armor? She's fucking this up! Hey, you know, we stay here, we're gonna die, right? We can't jump! Please, please, please! You think we wanna die from jumpin' off a cliff? - Fucking nuts! - I'm not gettin' paid enough for this shit! Killing bad guys is one thing, losing that shit... Listen to me... - I can't swim. - Hey, hey, you can do anything that you need to do to survive. You've already survived this far. Look at this. This jump? It's nothing. It's nothing, it's just air. That river, it's nothing. It's just water. You can do this, we're gonna be okay. I'm out! Masakh. Masakh! What are you doing? Get down! Get down! Not here, my friend. That man, he needs to die! - Take your revenge another time. - We've got to move! - Pata, now, move! - Listen to me... - Move! - Let's go! - Okay. - Okay? Pata! Let's move! Go, go, go, go, go! We gotta go. We gotta move. Move! Anyone want to go for a swim? Get your bikini! Go! Go! No, no, no! We're gonna die! Look at me. Look at me. Look at me. It's gonna be fine. Come on. Trust me. Trust me! You ready? On me. Move! Go! Let's go! TJ! No! Dammit! Shit. Get her. Come here. Get her, get her, get her. Hey, hey, pressure on the wound. TJ, put pressure on the wound. Bo, I'm out! Go! - I'm done. - No. No! - Just go! - You know what they're gonna do to a woman. I'll cover you. Don't worry, I'll be dead before they get me. - Moving! - Let's swim! I'm covering! Shit! Where are the girls? Where are the girls? I've got you. I've got you. I've got you. Shit! Come on. - Hold on! - Grab me by the hand! - Come on. Grab! - Grab her! - I got you. - Head count, head count! Grab my hand! Grab my hand! Are you okay, bruv? God, I'm so cold! Come on, you gotta get up. Come on. Come on. We gotta go. We didn't move that far. - Come on, you're there. - Come on! We gotta keep moving. We gotta keep moving. - There you go, buddy. - Come on. - Good. - Come on. Go. We gotta keep moving, come on. Let's go. - Stick together! - Barasa, on your feet. Let's keep heading down the river. Two clicks. And you're still in command? Yeah, you better fucking believe that I am. Even after your fucking mess? We'll see how much longer that lasts. Hey, hey. Another word out of your mouth, and we've got a problem. We've already got a fucking problem! We need to rest. We need a break. Please! - Please, we need a fucking break! - Come on. - We need to rest. I can't do it. - Take my hand. You don't know what we've been through! - There could be anything in there! - Get in the fucking water! I'm not getting in the fucking water! If you don't get in the water, you're gonna fucking die! You're wasting your ammo! Stop it! - Stop! Stop! - Stop! Everybody, move back! Move, move! We need to move back. There might be a new animal. We have to do something, Sam. She's dead. You're wasting ammo. Mike, Mike... they're gonna hear us. Come on. Move out! Zalaam! Brother, help me! You're dying, my brother. No... Yes. It's okay. This is your time. Do you remember Hillah? Huh? And all our brothers that were slaughtered at that day? Huh? Do you remember the ground? It was covered in blood, huh? And we'd say, it's as if the Earth was somehow crying for them. Do you remember that? For they wasn't crying out of sadness. They were crying out of joy. They are the lucky ones. They are the chosen ones... to have died that day. And now... you are the chosen one now. I love you, my brother. But no more suffering. - Yeah. - Easy, easy, easy. - Looks like a guard post. - Guarding what? Here, you guys sit down. Guys, we got buildings up there. Why don't you two go check it out? Oh, yippie! All right, me and you, Bo. Let's go. It's going to be a poacher's moon tonight. Bad for us. Why is that? It's a full moon, my friend. Abundant light in the night. Therefore, we are easy to see, easy to hunt. Hunt? Really? You think Zalaam is gonna give up so easily? She's the governor's daughter. With her in his hand, Zalaam is wielding much power. And he will not stop until he has the entire government on their knees... Hey, Pata, bro. That's enough. That's enough. I'm sorry. No, we are well, going to be safe here. Hey, this is the last time. Last time you said, "This was the last time." Yeah, but this time, it's really the last time. - Mm. - That was a shit sandwich back there. Tell me you don't think she fucked up, huh? The plan was to rescue one girl. We rescue three. Different plan. Different outcome. Yeah. I wonder what this place is. Looks like a farm. What do you think they kept here? I don't know. Let me know when you got an opinion. Yeah, you'll be the first to know. This looks like home. Yeah. - Let's knock. - Yeah. - Clear. - Yeah, it's good. Well done. You got a "well done." Shouldn't we ask... Sit there. Shouldn't we ask the owner's permission? We looked. No one here. Finders keepers, right? Mm. Where do you think they went? We're gonna find out. Eli, you good? - Always. - You guys get cleaned up. Joey, take care of that. The shit just hit the fan. Good time to go sober. Never a good time. Pata, Barasa, I want you on watch. Keep on comms. Copy you. Wait, wait. So we just wait here until they come again? We're far ahead. They're not gonna be able to track us. We're gonna find a way to call for help. - What about the sat phone? - It's fucked. Bullet went right through it. I guess they don't make these 762 proof. You got the receipt? Well, don't you guys have radios? Just for us. Not enough range. Oh, okay. Don't worry. We got this. You guys get some rest. You two, on me. Oh, shit. Fucking things. Waterlogged. Any one of you got a ball of rice? Don't look at me, huh? Chinaman. You okay? Yeah. Are you? - Yeah. - Good. You two check the perimeter. If you hear or see anything, check in. Copy you. Radio check. Good check. Good check. Thanks, Joey. - Can you grab my med kit? - Yeah. - Thank you. - Yeah. Ooh. Who's hungry? I am. What is it? Energy bar. Oh, okay. Better than nothing. Don't eat all at once, huh? Okay, slowly, slowly. Joey. Hey, thanks, brother. It's so good, but so gross. - Oh, yeah. - Mm-mm. Like cup noodles. Mmm. Can I help you? It's not the first time. What, that you've been shot? Yeah, shot, stabbed, beaten. And that was before he joined the Marines. No, it's right there. So why is she in charge? Sam, or whatever her name is? Oh... You should ask her. Her dad's the governor. He employed her. And so she employs you guys? Yeah. It's okay, I got it. I got it. So you're just in this for the money. What, you want me to fight for free? Why not? Zealots and believers do. And ain't they just the loveliest people. So if she didn't pay you, we'd still be in those fucking cages? Tessa, they're trying to help us. I know. I mean, this is just a job to them. She's just a boss, and they don't even fucking like her. Who likes their boss, huh? Yeah, but you don't think that she can do this, do you? - I just think that... - Is she good? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, she's good. She's been in The Suck, and she's been in some gnarly places, and she came out forged hard. Maybe too hard. But she will... get us out of here? Yes. Fuck. There's no power. The whole camp doesn't have power. The generator must be off. Okay, we find the gennie, get it started, and get this kit back online. Call for an extraction. That sounds like a plan... if we can find the generator. Huh, back in business, bruv. Fuckin' wonder where everyone went. There are many abandoned farms and villages here. So, when Al-Shabaab came, many people ran away. Others were killed. So you're from here? I am Maasai, yes. So this whole area was my home. When did you move? I didn't. I stayed. You're actually saying you joined them. I stayed. I believed everything the imam was saying. I was a young person. What? That's why you knew that big tosser back at the cliff. Masakh. You see, that man... I'm telling you, one day, I will kill him. For all of my sins and his. We've all done bad things, bruv. That's how we end up here. What do you think dug this? It's big rats. Big, big, big rats. Mm... Look at this mess. Blood in the backyard, too. What do you think? Looks like the driver was cut up and dragged out. Yeah, it looks like it. This one's left running. Looks like they were trying to get away when they were hit. By what? I don't know. Big rats. This place just... feels wrong. Are we doing feelings now? Yeah, I got feelings. I know you do. What I'm saying is that I don't think it's a bad idea if you just show it, you know, just-just every now and then. Oh, yeah? What good is that gonna do? Makes you human, Sam. It'll help you keep your team in line. My team is getting paid to be in line. Not the ones that don't make it home. Hey, Sam. I've got your back. Always. On three. Three. What the fuck is this? It's what I thought... A lion farm. Poachers' stronghold. A lion farm? Why would you farm lions? You can't eat 'em. Oh, their skins... and these bones crushed up, it's worth a lot of money in the East. - Fuckers. - I thought that was tigers. Tigers started becoming rare, so they turned to lions. Now the lions are becoming rare. The difference is that they breed really well in captivity. So we have lion farms. All the big males are shot in canned lion-hunting farms. Some rich, fucking lazy, dickhead comes here with $100,000, shoots the animal, flies back, he's got a nice big head he can put on his wall, and a story about how brave he was to kill the king of the jungle. These animals have never known freedom. Where they put them out, that's where they die. - That's fucked up. - It is fucked up. This is fucked up. Looks like maybe the lions got their own back. Good. - What do you think, like... - Hmm. I don't know. Maybe two days? Hmm, huh. I don't know. I don't know. I can't tell in this heat. Generator went down... the lions dug themselves out. Okay, but where did they go? Back to the bush. There's no reason for them to stay here. Good luck to them. You know, Sam, when I was a little boy... Oh, here we go. Another "When I was a little boy" story. - No, no, no. This is a good one. - I can't wait. When I was a little boy, I used to dream about being chased by lions. And no matter how fast or how high I jumped, those motherfuckers... Hey, boss. This place looks deserted. You got anything? Yeah. We got a couple of ripe bodies. - It's pretty gnarly. - Copy you. Got few more of these huts to check out. Stand by. Elijah? Elijah?! Elijah?! Elijah! Oh, shit... Fuck... Elijah. Elijah. What are they shooting at?! Get down! Get down! Get down! Get down! Shh. What do you see? - Okay, okay. - What do you see? Stay down. Get down. - Quiet. - Please. - Okay. - Shh. Hey, Bo. You stay with them, okay? No, you stay. You're more injured. This? What's that? Hey, be my guest. You're supposed to argue more. Nah, we're good. - Jesus... - What is it? What happened? - Something took Elijah. - What do you mean, something? - Is he dead? - Yes, he's fucking dead. He-he's torn to pieces. Bo Yinn, what would your mother say, huh? She'd say... Oh, shit! Shit. Stay here. Don't move! Don't move! No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Bo! Bo! Lion... A lion... I got it. - It's injured. - Yeah, good job. You tagged it, buddy. - Yeah. - Yeah. Yeah. Ooh, got you too a little bit, huh? Okay, he got me, too. Just a little bit. - What the fuck happened here? - A fucking lion got him. Shit. One killed Elijah, too. Elijah's dead? - All right, put it down. - Okay, get his webbing off. - Look at me, Bo. Look at me. - Get his webbing off, we need to see. There you go. There you go. Okay, he's got lacerations all up the left side. - Give him that morphine, give him that morphine. - He's bleeding out here. - What happened to him? - Someone get the tourniquet. - Someone talk to me! - Okay. Bo, look at me. Give him the lollipop. He needs the morphine. Get it. What the fuck happened to him? - A lion! - My God! - Come help. Help now. - Hold on. This is gonna hurt, buddy. - Lion attack him. - There you go. I need you to put pressure on this wound. - Hold on, man. Hold on, Bo. - No, I don't wanna hurt him. Put pressure on the wound, or he'll fucking die. - I got it. I got it. - There you go. - Press it down. Down. - Oh, my God! Oh, my God! - Hold on, buddy. - Oh, fuck. - There you go. - Hey, Bo? - Hey, hey... - Hey, hey, hey. Stay with me. - Stay with us! - Stay here. - Bo, in the room, in the room. - Fuck. Fuck! ♪ Everybody ♪ - ♪ Yeah ♪ - Open up. - ♪ Rock your body ♪ - What the fuck? ♪ Yeah ♪ ♪ Everybody ♪ ♪ Rock your body right ♪ ♪ Backstreet's back, all right! ♪ You're right, it is very annoying. - Very annoying. - It's very annoying. Boss, boss! I've picked up their trail. - Where? - Five miles, south. Well done, brother. Let's go! Come on. Come on! Joey, Mike. I gave him all the morphine we had. The bleeding has stopped, but he needs an extraction. We all need an extraction. So we gotta get comms up. All right. So this is us. There's a VHF radio in this building, but it has no power. I didn't see a generator, but you gotta assume there is one. Uh, you also gotta assume that it's out of gas. So we're gonna identify the generator, gas it up, get the power on, get the radio working. All before our friends come back. Lion friends, or terrorist friends? Grindr friends. Look, I think we can do this. I know we've all been through a lot worse. No. Not without ammo, fucking weapons, or some backup. There's a first time for everything. Plus, I think there's many places a lion can hide here. And why is the fucking thing still here? Seriously, why isn't it out with his fucking fuzzy friends out there? Because some lions go rogue. They like to kill. So we're at the bottom of the food chain. What's the deal with the ammo? What do we got left? That's nothing. Jesus. Shooting her won't help anyway. This caliber... This is not going to stop her. It might annoy her, but she will kill you first. How do you know it's a "she"? Because females are the true killers. Okay. Well, what about, uh, what about fire? They're afraid of fire, right? Can we make that work? Truth with lions, actually, they're not afraid of fire. In fact, it might even attract them. Makes you wonder how the fuck we got out of Africa in the first place, huh? Why do you know so much about lions? Our Maasai people have been living alongside lions for generations. Hunting them is a tradition. Passage into manhood. In fact, a boy has to kill a lion in order to be a man. So you've killed one? No, I didn't. I couldn't. I just couldn't. I couldn't take life in order to prove some kind of ideal of manhood. I... I shamed my family. Hey, I-I think that the ability to kill is the least quality that it takes to be a man. So what do you do when something tries to kill you? I guess we'll find out. - You ready? - Yeah. Barasa, you see anything? Almost in position, boss. Stand by. Okay. Come on. Oh, fuck. Where's this fucking thing? I'm gonna go check these buildings over here. You get our six. Copy. Sam... Sam, don't run. Do not act like prey. We are prey. It's just a walk in the woods. I hate the woods. Got ya. It's all clear, boss. Copy. Pata, eyes on you. You hold there. Okay, copy you. Wait! Stop, stop, stop! The lion is right there. Ten o'clock. Keep still, don't move. Fucking things! Talk to me. Where is she? Bear with me, boss. Technical problems. Not prey. Not prey. Not prey. Not prey. Barasa, can you see her? Okay, okay, just-just give me a second. We go back? We gotta have that radio, Joey. Barasa, anything? Okay, stand by. Fuck. We lost her, boss. Start walking. Get me eyes on her. Copy? Stand by, boss. Fucking equipment failure. Nothing, boss. Okay. I'll go east, you go west. Oh, yes! Wow! Fuck. Shit! Oh, shit! Joey, I found the generator, but there's no fuel. I can fix that. I found the fuel. Bring it to me. Yeah, coming now. Fucking thing! Shit. Fucking things! Thank you. There. All right. Oh, my gosh! C'mon! Yeah, that's it. We're back in business, boss. Yeah. All right. C'mon, baby. All right. No! No, no. Boss... She got him. Barasa's gone. Shit! On me! Goodbye, my friend. Station One, this is Rogue Team, over. Come on... Station One, this is Rogue Team, over. Rogue Team, go for Station One. We lost the Osprey extraction, and we're in urgent need of assistance. We have the governor's daughter plus one. She's a British national. We've an Al-Shabaab militia group in close proximity. We're out of ammo. We have multiple wounded, we have hostile animals near. We're in urgent need of extraction. How copy? Copy that. That's a negative on extraction. No asset free until dawn. Negative. We're not gonna make it six hours. We need assistance now. Put Briggs on. Roger that. Sam, this is Briggs. Send sitrep. We have the girl. Good job. I'll let the governor know. Heard you're having a little trouble? We're not gonna make the night. You will. You always do, Sam. That's why I bring you on the tough jobs. Make it till dawn, and I promise you, I'll get you out of there. Dawn. Copy. Out. Whose stupid fucking idea was this mission anyway? Uh, yours. Oh, yeah. Help is coming. We just have to stay here a little while longer. - How much longer? - Till sunrise. What? We can't do that. Yes, you can. Just a few more hours. But, Sam, they will come for us. They won't. They don't know where you are. You're safe, it's fine. We're not safe here. Zalaam does not give up. She is of value to them. She was not taken just for a ransom of money. She means they have power over her father. That gives him control over this entire region. You seem to know an awful lot about him. Why is that? Because I was an Al-Shabaab soldier. I'm sorry. What the fuck? Hey, no! You're one of them! Does my father know that you've trusted the enemy? Your father knows a lot more than you think. What does that mean? We couldn't have rescued you without Pata. I'll take this, okay? No bullets. We're out of ammo, remember? The men that took us are evil! I'm not evil! I'm not like one of them! I would never be abducting little girls and be... Asilia, Asilia, show 'em. - Oh, fucking Christ! - No! He needs to see! Look at this! They whipped her, and they beat us! Look at that! I don't know what your idea of evil is, but if you're with the kind of people that do that, then you're not coming out the other side as Mother fucking Theresa. I was... I was young when I... when I joined. So? I tried to leave long ago. But they made it clear that... if you leave, they will kill your children and your family. So I stayed. Zalaam came from England, a man with many ideas to teach us. To teach the people the ways of Allah. Jesus Christ, get to the fucking point! I left! We escaped, okay? That is why I'm here. But they came. And they did exactly what they said that they would do. My children... My family... All of them, you see? And they decided to-to keep me alive, and they made me watch. They came to our school... our class. They lined eight of us against the wall... told us to get down on our knees, bound our hands behind our back, put bags over our heads. And he said, if we made a sound... he would shoot us. And we waited. We waited to die. We didn't make a sound. I waited my turn to die! We waited our turn to die! He killed them, when they could've just taken me! I never saw any hostages. Those hostages have names! We have names! What were your children's names? What were their names? What were their names? I'm sorry. Boss, somebody needs to keep watch. I need to keep watch, boss. The others in position? All in position. Spread out. Come in from all sides. And remember, the girl lives. Everyone else, do as Allah commands. Go! It's about time we let them know we're here. - Yeah, it is. - You got the C-4? Let's go. She's a good girl. Yeah. She cares about things. More than I do, anyway. Are you guys friends? Hmm, not really. I mean, I hardly knew her before this little adventure. Why are you in Africa? Just lucky, I guess. My parents' grand idea to help ground me was to send me to an expensive international school. Wow. Count yourself lucky. I mean, my parents sent me to military academy when I was 13. I don't think I even left campus before I was 16. From there, it was straight into basic training, and then right into the Rangers Academy. So no husband, kids, ten cats? No, no, and no. Mm. I live a moment away from death, either mine or someone else's, so I just don't really want to do that to another person, you know. Yeah. I mean, I figured you were just too much of a bitch - for someone to handle. - Yeah, there is that. So what are you gonna do when you get home? You think we're getting home? Five more hours. Cakewalk. He's here, he's here! Zalaam is here! He's coming! Sit down. Hey, just get over there. Sit down. Sit now! Okay, so, I spotted a scout over on the east side. - Whoa! Whoa! - Hey! What are you doing, you crazy little man? I heard there is a fight that I didn't want to miss out. Okay, there's no ammo in this. You're gonna stay here with the girls. No, I can fight. Let me fight. I can't just sit here. That's exactly what you're gonna do. Sit the fuck down, right now! - No! - Captain's orders. She's not a captain. Are you? Are you a captain? You know I'm a fucking captain, Bo. - But you're a girl. - Whoa! Hey! That's just the morphine talking. Come here. Let's have a lie down. - I'm here. - There you go, Bo. There you go. And if you feel the need to walk to that big, bright light at the end of the tunnel, just remember... - ♪ Everybody ♪ - Yeah, yeah, that's right. ♪ Everybody ♪ Sam, what's the plan? Sit down. Sit down! - That's not the plan. - Shut the fuck up! Sit down! Holy shit, boss! Good news. Joey, what've you got? Boss, I found a Lee Enfield. It's got nine rounds. I figured we could shoot a couple of those fuckers, take their AKs, even the odds. Boom! Get out! Oh, shit! Hey! Hey! Get off me, you... Hey! Me! Me! Look at me! Oh, fuck! Tessa! Oh, fuck! Okay. Well, that doesn't work. That's right. Fuck you good. Fuck you, pussycat. Just because I'm a fucking dog person, eh? Come here, kitty cat! Sam, draw it out! Give me the shot! Sam! Sam, you gotta move. You gotta draw it out so I can get a shot. Hey, kitty, kitty. Holy shit! Well, turns out Pata was right. They really were coming. Jesus, Joey, that lion really fucked you up. Yeah, I've had worse relationships. But those scars, they're deep on the inside. Can you see them? You good for this fight? Are you good to do this? Oh, yeah. Yeah, I got a... I got a little gas in the tank. No, not a whole, but light... light's on, you know, but it's not empty. - Good - Yeah, you want a gun? No, no, I'm gonna figure something out. You keep this. Let's go get the girls. Let's fucking go. All right, fuckers! Move! Light 'em up! Keep moving, boss! - Boss? - Moving! Move! Are you okay? He's here. Zalaam's here? Yeah, it looks like it. Where's Tess? She was... I thought she was behind me. - We have to find her. - Yes, I'm going to. You have to stay here, and you do not fucking move until I tell you, do you understand? Do you understand? Yes! Joey. Joey. Joey, I've got Asilia. She's in the comms room. Do you have eyes on the other one? That's a negative, boss. But I'll keep my eyes open. Thank you. Out. Okay. Okay. That's quite heavy. Shit! No! No! No need to take you alive. Come on! Grab on, let's go! No, no, Sam! Run! Back! Up, now, now, now. Come on, get down. Ooh, no, he's gonna get me. Ah, he missed. There you are. You son of a bitch. Okay. Ah... fuck, I'm good. - Go, go, go, go, go. - Follow me! Okay. Okay, when I say go, you're gonna run to the comms room, Right there. It's where Asilia is. - Okay? - I'm not gonna leave you. You can do it. You can go, all right? I'm gonna cover you. Okay? When I say, go. - Okay, okay. Yeah. - Ready? Go. Okay. Fuck! Hold on! Wait, wait, wait... Shit. Fucking stupid, Samantha. Fuck. All right, now we got an even fight. Asilia! Are you okay? - Where's Sam? - She's coming. Get the door. Get the door! - Okay. You want help? - Wait. What? Wait! We can't always be babies. We-we can't stay here, we will die. - I mean, yeah. - We have to fight. - You wanna fight? - I've never fought back in my entire life, - but I wanna fucking fight! - Okay. - Okay, you ready? - Shh. Okay. Hey, boss. I've got you. Here, take this. - Moving. - Covering! Okay... There's no one else I would've rather been kidnapped with. That's fucked up even for you. - I'm scared. - Me too. Me too. Let's do this. Okay, let's go. Shit... Oh, no. No. Oh, no... - You are Zalaam's now. - No! - Quiet now! - Let go! Masakh! Pata! My brother! You're still breathing, ah? And you grow some balls. Come. Come! Come again. Ah? Come on, man. Huh? Coward! Where was your bravery before, when you stood by and watched your family die, huh? Hey... Huh? Hey? Huh? Huh? We... let you live. We let you live! That was no life! Stay down! Look at me. Look at me. You took everything from me! My children's names were... Tabu... Josie and Sarah. Now... Now, I am a man. I think I saw him over there! Go... This is a good death. You did good, brother. Your family would be proud. Oh, hey, Bo. My brother. Why don't you pull up a chair? I clipped a guy over-over there. Hey, he dropped his AK. You got the strength to go over there and get it? Yeah, me neither. She's out there. Uh, the lion? No. No... with the fire and the-the fighting, no. There's no way she stayed. She doesn't even have a reason. Unless she's just mean. It's justice if she takes us. Huh... The things we've done to this world... Death... So much death. These creatures were killed for what? Medicine? Magic charms? I don't understand how anyone would want these animals dead... instead of alive. For a belief a thousand years old. I'm ashamed. Oh, hi, boys. ♪ Am I everything you need? ♪ ♪ You better rock your body and... ♪ ♪ Everybody ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ ♪ Rock your body ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ ♪ Everybody ♪ ♪ Rock your body right... ♪ Wow. Well, that happened. But you were right. She is still out there. You rest well, you crazy Chinaman. - What's going on? - Fuck... - Fuck you! - Come here. - Shit. Fuck! - You bitch! Fucking... Shit! I should've known you'd be a handful when we first got you. Fucking Midlands girl, right? Fuck you! Murderer! Traitor! I'm not a murderer any more than your government's a murderer. Your government, too, dickhead! Nah. Not anymore. It's not my country. It never wouldn't wanted me in the first place or anyone in my skin color or religion. I don't get to go back home. At least, I'm welcome here. 'Cause of what you've done! - I haven't even started yet! - No, no, no, no. - Get up! Get up! - No! Get up! - No, no, no... - Shut your mouth! Hey, baby. No, no, no, no, no! Let her go. Hey, hey. She's not the one that you want. You're not the one I want, either. So no, fuck it. I think I might cut her head off. - No! - Real slow! Tess, Tess. Hey, hold still. It's gonna be okay. Why the fuck would you say that? You know it's not gonna be. Huh? Shut the fuck up! Okay, take me. Okay? Are you stupid or something? I told you, I want the governor's daughter! Now, I know you know where she is. So bring her to me. Now, if you don't, you're all gonna die anyway. Including this one. Your choice! Ah! He's gonna do it. - Yeah. - Okay, I'll give her to you. Just call off your men, and you let her go. Yeah, two lives for one. - I'll go find her. - Hurry the fuck up! - Fuck! - Get down on the floor! Shit. - Fuck. - We wait. Asilia? Asilia? Hey. Hey, Asilia. I fucking told you to stay in... I killed a man. - I fucking... - Yes. - I fucking... - Okay. - I killed a man. - Yes. I know it's hard. Just... we can finish this. But I need you to listen. I need you to be strong. I have a plan, okay? Where is she? This way, come on. Fuck me. Well? Where is she? She's in the barn. You can take her easily, and that way she won't know that it was me. Why do you care so much about what she thinks of you? Because I promised her I would keep her safe. Oh, yeah? Well, you lied. Now lead the way. - Get up! - Tess, come on. Come on! Why's she so valuable to you, anyway? Her father's never gonna give you power. It doesn't matter what you do to her. I want what's owed to me. Okay, so what about the Caliphate? Caliphate? There is no Caliphate. It's about what it's always about. It's about money. Her father stole... don't look at me! Her father stole from me! He owes me. Okay. So this was all an act. Would you prefer if I was some zealot? That's for fools, man. Her father deals in the exact same ivory trade as we do. Lion parts, rhino horns. Even this place, he owns it. Part of his business... breeding lions to shoot for profit. No, her father's a conservationist. Oh, yeah, of course, he is. It's a great cover story, innit? The fact is, everything has a value... animals, humans. He has the highest kill count in the whole of the country, and he plays dirty. But don't worry, I can play dirty, too. - You get me? - Yeah, okay. She's in there. I told her to hide. You can just go in and make it look like you found her. Are you trying to take me for some dickhead or something? You think I'm dumb, going in there alone? You first. Let Tess go. You don't need her. - Go on. Get out of here. - Go. Lead the way. You can come out now, Asilia. So where is she? Run, now. Hey, girls. Look what I found. What, you think that scares me? I told you, I'm fucking bad man out here. I've got the gun. I've got the power. Actually, I don't think either of us do. So now you have a choice. Which bitch is gonna kill you? I swear one of us will. Well, then, you die first. All hail the queen. Put it down, Tess. Put it down. Yeah. Go, ho-ho. Oh, my God. All she wanted was to protect her cubs. And that's why she stayed behind and the rest of them left. She reminds me of someone I know. Hey, what am I, chopped liver? Hey, you did okay. - I mean, for a guy. - Yeah, yeah. - Or did you want a hug? - No, no. - Maybe you do. - Oh, oh. I got issues. Oh. Ooh. Oh, that hurt. Ow.
