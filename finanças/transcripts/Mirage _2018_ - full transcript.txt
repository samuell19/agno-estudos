NETFLIX PRESENTS MIRAGE In meteorological terms, we have to talk about the arrival of an electrical storm which will extend throughout the northern third of the Peninsula. The great atmospheric instability has been forming different supercells in permanent rotation. The National Meteorology Institute predicts that these will be particularly visible from tonight and that they will remain for the next 72 hours, leading to strong downpours that may cause malfunctions in electrical devices and problems with communications, therefore the Civil Guard has established some rules as a precaution to protect our people. We are now able to offer the emergency story that we announced previously which has just arrived this minute from Berlin. At the centre of the story is our special correspondent, Jose Maria Siles. Absolute normality on the streets of East Berlin, at nightfall. Only a few onlookers have come to Brandenburg Gate. In the West, at Check Point Charlie, the crossing point between both Berlins, the first onlookers and television cameras are arriving. Shortly before midnight, here, in Neukölln, the border has opened informally for all Germans from the East that want to come here to the West. In 27 years, it is the first time that the Berlin Wall no longer exists for citizens from the other Germany. November 9th, 1989... Mum. You just ruined my tape. I'm going to work. Don't go to bed too late, you have class tomorrow, OK? OK. Nico, have you recorded my tape? Yes... I LOVE YOU, MUM Ms. Weiss. Ms. Weiss. Wait! Wait! No! Help! Help! I need help! Nico! I need help! Good morning, my love. Hey... Hey... Come on... How did you sleep? I don't like this house, it's cold. You've only been here one night. I want my room. Well, you'll get it soon. Alright? Hey, come on, let's go! Hello, darling, are you here? Yes, I brought my flight forward. But I have to spend all day in meetings, because they want to review the targets, they say we don't sell enough insurance and all that... I'll be a little late. Well... Like always... I'll make it up to you... now confess. Alright, I slept with her. - You slept together? - Yes, we slept together. I knew it. Put her on. Wait. Gloria, talk to Daddy. Hello, Dad. Hello, how's my little monster? Everything smells like paint. You'll see, soon it will be much better than in the city. - OK? - OK. - Has the meeting started? - They are waiting for you. A new client, Ms. Velazquez, is coming tomorrow. - OK, make a note. - Alright. Honey, can I get back to Mum? - He wants to talk to you. - Yes? OK. Why don't you tell Aitor to come for dinner? I'll tell him now. Hey, I love you. I love you too. What are you doing, Mum? The storm. It's the same, the same as years ago. Well, I'm going to work. I'll be right back. Don't smoke too much, OK? Careful. - I wanted to ask. - Go ahead. We're leaving. Can you lock up the door and leave the key in the house upfront? Good morning, neighbour! - Good morning! - How's it going? If I was a passenger and saw you in that, I swear I'd get off the plane. Where's your husband? He spent the night in Seville. - Oh, yes? - Yes. He wants to make dinner tonight, what about it? I think he's incredibly cheeky, but... - Stop now! - But... Besides that... I fly to Marseilles and this evening I think I'll be here, so... Tell your mother to come. - Sure? - It'd be great. - I'd like to see her. - Alright. That's all. - Ciao. - Ciao. Commander! The electrical storm is expected to start with force from early tonight with an approximate duration of 72 hours. It is the first time astrophysicists agree on highlighting the exceptional nature of a phenomenon that seems to be repeating itself, as in 1989, there was a very similar storm, with a symmetrical structure... I didn't know you were back. My holidays were short but intense. What happened here? Did a tropical mosquito bite you? Or did you bring someone home in your suitcase? How's the new house? When did I tell you we've moved? Half the hospital knows. Good, honestly it has all been very quick, the owner had left the house years ago, she was in a hurry to sell it. It needs some work but that's all, we can't complain. But I do. They're going to open my head. Don't worry. Dr. Fell is the best specialist in craniotomy in the hospital. Hello. Ready, Mr. Mendoza? Here we go. Good morning. Hello, Doctor. Congratulations on the article. Did you read it? What happened with Ms. Blanco? She developed "alequestesia". Injury of the spinothalamic tract? No, she required an anterolateral cordotomy. Right. The more I know you, the less I understand that you quit medicine. Well, I had Gloria, and... I don't like to do things halfway. So you're lucky that I quit medicine. Now I would be the best neuro-surgeon in this hospital. Hello! How are you? Can Greta come home? If her mum is OK with it... I'm sure she is. I'll call her, OK? Girls... what did we agree on? Your mother is taking you to the dentist. Ah, alright, OK, OK. I get it... Are you coming, storyteller? - Ciao, Miranda. - Bye, Greta. Can you see anything? I promise. I can't see anything. - Sure you're not cheating? - No. Wait. Nearly... Ready? Yes. You wanna try? Come on! Hello. You're going to give me a heart attack. When did you arrive? - Half an hour ago. - Half an hour? What are you doing? Organising the books to make our library. What's this? Look. You were dating her when we met, right? And that face? What face? - You're jealous. - No. I saw it in your eyes, you're a little jealous. No, no. You did get a little bit jealous. No. She was very pretty, she is very pretty. - Show me? Ursula, maybe I'll call her one of these days. So pretty. What happened here? - Nothing. I was there... - With what? That sign, I was putting it up and I cut myself. Did you disinfect it? Honey, it's a very small cut, I disinfected it, and used a band aid, Dr. Roy. You know that I always liked the idea that after graduation everyone would call you Dr. Vera Roy? - Alright, enough. - Alright. - Yes. Let's go. What's this? Incredible. This camera must be at least 20 or 30 years old. Of course. The tapes. This has been here since the 80's. Why don't we call Gloria and see if it works? Do you know that this tape was recorded on today's exact date, but in 1989? Seriously? You just ruined my tape. - Put another one on. - That was the last. Did you like it? Who's going to keep it? I'll start making dinner, because they will be here soon. Yes, I'll take a shower. Are you hungry? Absolute normality on the streets of East Berlin, at nightfall. Only a few onlookers have come to Brandenburg Gate. What's this? At Check Point Charlie, crossing point between both Berlins... I don't know. But there's no tape in. No. Besides, now the channels don't broadcast in analogue. ...has opened informally for all Germans... - It doesn't make any sense, David. - No? A television signal from 25 years ago? Did you say hi to Clara? I swear, the TV came alive. Came alive? - Came alive? - Came alive! Are you listening to your crazy husband? Came alive? Are you still talking about the TV? Of course we are. - Cover your ears, honey. - Why? I'm going to tell Mum a secret. Mum and I don't have secrets. Not even one? Let's see... What don't you understand? - I was the better catch. - Yeah right! Stop listening in! I was a better catch and you let me go. Why? What can we say? Why? Because some things are destined to be how they are. Alright? - What is this? That hand. - What's going on? 5 minutes and you're holding hands. Don't exaggerate. - Who wants meat? - Clara. By the way, why are you still using that toaster of a TV? It's just that, I don't know... Can't you afford to buy...? Hilarious. We were watching the tapes we found, that's all. There was a boy singing. A boy singing, eh? - Do you want some? - Sure. Thank you. That boy was Nico Lasarte. He was my best friend. He loved playing the guitar and always told me that he would be a rock star. Mum always took us to school together. Until... the neighbour from next-door - killed his wife. - Aitor. And Nico saw it. Aitor, enough. Then he was run over. On a night like this, with a storm. Remember that the next day a lightning hit the facade of the school, by the clock, and we had no power and no class for a week. Shut up! Shut up. Stop it. You're frightening the girl. Can't you see? It's alright, it's just a lightning storm. It'll go away, you'll see... Wanna know a secret? Lie down. Look, when I was 7 years old, I was really, really frightened by storms, just like you, you know what I did? Look, I took Granny's music box and watched the ballerina. I watched her dance and I forgot about everything. I watched her dance, dance, until I fell asleep. You wanna try? ANGEL PRIETO COMMITS SUICIDE IN HIS CELL Does it hurt? Why don't you get it checked? He killed himself 3 months after entering prison. Here it says he owned an abattoir and was going to bury his wife underneath it. Who confesses something he was going to do but didn't because he was arrested first? Why don't we change the subject? Someone who says what he would have done but didn't do it, that's not a common killer. Are you a psychologist now? No, but it's strange. Don't you think so? Are they dirty? I love when you make that face, when you don't like something. Your nose wrinkles, turns up... - No - Yes. Your nose goes like this, wrinkled. Like a rabbit face. - Oh, yes? - A tiny rabbit. - An ugly rabbit. - What's this? Have you been smoking? Are you controlling me? What? Are you controlling me? Come on, honey, I'm joking. You always fall for it, you know me. I like jokes. Yesterday in the hotel, in Seville, - I went to the café... - You don't have to explain. I had one and dumped the rest. - I promise. Let's do something. - OK. Look. Done. - Nothing happened. - OK. - Like nothing happened. Really? - Yes, yes. ...we're able to offer the emergency story that we announced previously which has just arrived this minute from Berlin. ...the border has opened informally for all Germans from the East that want to come here to the West. In 27 years, it is the first time that the Berlin Wall no longer exists for citizens from the other Germany. November 9th, 1989, is a day for the history of Germany and Europe as a whole. This couple has just arrived and can't believe it. They just had to present their identity card, and they received a stamp. It is their first time in the West, but they don't intend to stay. At home, in the East, on the other side, their son is waiting, and they work at 8 am. Nico, I'm going to work. Mum, the camera broke. Don't go to bed late, you have class tomorrow, OK? OK. Nico, have you recorded my tape? Yes. Hello? Can you hear me? Hello? Can you see me? Yes. Yes, I can see you. How do you do it? - How do I do what? - Hold on! That sign is the same as the Valpineda station. What? It's the same, just worn out. It's the same one. How do you have it? We stole it. My husband and I stole it. I don't understand. Aitor, your neighbour, introduced me to David, my husband, I met Aitor at Valpineda station. Aitor Medina! Wait, wait! His mother takes you to school. Do you know why I know? I know because it already happened. What already happened? - What is it? - Shouting, outside. Wait, wait, wait. Nico! Nico, come back! How do you know my name? You used to live here. Here, where? Something's wrong next door. Don't go, please, you shouldn't go. Wait. Am I dreaming? No. Wait. Look what I have, look. Look. See? See? My tapes. How did you get those? Nico, I live in your house. This is your house, in 25 years time. What? Look. I'm going to show you something. Look, see? CHILD KILLED IN VALPINEDA This is you, if you go outside. No... - It's a trick. How do you do it? - No. No, no! It's not, it's real. - This is real. - You're lying. Nico, wait! I know what's going to happen at your school tomorrow. Lightning is going to hit the clock at the entrance, the entire school will lose power and the classes will be cancelled. If you stay in your room, you'll see I'm right, but if you go outside, tomorrow you will be dead. Nico, Nico, Nico, Nico, please, please don't go, don't go outside, Nico please, please, wait! Wait! Stay inside! Nico, please don't go outside. Don't go, a car will hit you! When you cross the road it will hit you! Nico, please! Please, no! Yes? Maria, it's Clara, did I wake you? No. I'm just back from work. I don't feel well, my brother will bring the kids to school, OK? Alright, don't worry. Feel better soon. Why are you awake? Aitor's mother isn't well, her brother will bring you to school, OK? Nico. Mum, I dreamed without sleeping. A woman from the future spoke to me through the TV. Vera! They're waiting for you in the OR. Why is he here? Mr. Mendoza has cerebrovascular insufficiency. Yes, Dr. Fell operated on him yesterday. Mr. Mendoza is your patient. What? Vera. We need to open him up now. Dr. Roy, are you ready to get dressed? What did you call me? Sorry? What's happening here? What is this? What are you doing? Dr. Roy. Are you alright? Come on, we're late. Nico, careful with the skateboard, the other day... I'll be back at 5, OK? What happened, uncle Roman? I don't know. Let's ask. Excuse me, miss. Is there a problem? The storm caused an electrical fault, there's no power. Class is suspended. Oh... Come on kids, let's go home. Hi Greta, have you seen Gloria? Gloria who? Gloria, my daughter. I'm her mum. Don't you remember me? No. Hello, Miranda. Pablo, go to class. Can I help you? Yes, I'm looking for Gloria. Can I see her a minute? Gloria... Gloria, Gloria Ortiz. Gloria is... Miranda, I'm Vera! I'm sorry, I don't know you. I'm looking for my daughter. Class is suspended. Nico forgot his keys and his mother's asleep. Clara, I have to go to the airport. Go on, kids! Hi Lidia. I'm here to see David. Ms. Velazquez? He's waiting in his office. Go through. David! What's happening? Lidia doesn't recognise me. I went to Gloria's school, she's not there. They say she's not a student. Her teacher doesn't know me and her friend Greta doesn't know who she is either. Where did you leave Gloria? Sorry. You're not Ms. Velazquez, right? David, enough, really. Really, that's enough. I'm really tired... Son of a bitch! Damn German. Who is German! I believed you for a second! - You were great! Brilliant! - That's enough, David! - Not funny. - Don't touch. David, it's me! Quit the fucking joke, David! - Tell me where Gloria is. - Enough. Who the hell are you and who is Gloria? Gloria is our daughter! Nico told me that last night he heard shouting in Mr. Prieto's house. A woman screamed, it was scary. Maybe it was Ms. Weiss. What do you think, Mum? Did you see or hear anything else, Nico? No, because the TV... I looked out the window, but nothing. We spied from my room, and you know what? The blinds are down and Bruno is tied to the shed, howling. Mr. Prieto always feeds him in the morning, but not today. Aitor, do you believe in time travel? POLICE STATION What can I say? I didn't start this. I don't know why David, or my daughter's school act like I'm someone I'm not. I know it seems like I'm lying, or crazy, but the only thing I can think of is that it's a type of joke. Can you help me? Yes, I can help you, but first I need to ask you some questions. When was the last time you saw your daughter? Last night. She was scared, she was frightened of the storm. And the man you say is your husband? David Ortiz is my husband. What is the last thing you remember with him? Last night, too. Your nose wrinkles up... Before bed... - Yes? - Like a rabbit. He lied about something silly. He'd been smoking. Nothing else? I don't understand the questions. I'm trying to see it. I think we're wasting time. Vera. If you want me to help you, you have to help me to understand. The smallest details. Alright. Before everything changed, what is the last thing you remember? The story of the boy who lived in our house. A neighbour of Aitor Medina, our friend. Aitor told us that he died. Hit by a car running out of another house. A man... it all sounds sinister, a man killed his wife, and... the boy found out. Continue, please. Then... Then I think I dreamed about him. He appeared on an old television, and... Hello? Before he died, I tried to save him. Can you hear me? I tried to warn him, to save him. Do you remember the boy's name? Nico Lasarte. And then... Something very strange happened. Nico, please, please, no... I don't remember anything else. All I can say right now is that you are confused. We have verified that... you don't live where you said, you're not married to David Ortiz. There is no birth certificate for your daughter. She officially was not born. We haven't found a single photo of her. You don't have any. Nobody has ever seen her, Vera. The life you speak of only exists in your mind. Hello? Are you there? Answer me! Here's the passport, ticket and Marks. Thank you. How is she, Doctor? Good, this is the last test. The results don't show any anatomic alteration. Your brain's activity is optimal, so we can dismiss any neurological impairment. He was your first intervention leading a surgical team. You extracted a meningioma from his brain. Whatever you know about him, here is the answer. It's true. David had a meningioma removed, I remember. But it wasn't me, I don't operate. You're the neurosurgeon, I wasn't even in the post-operative because I had the flu. Monica took over. Come with me. This is your office. Look around and you will remember. You're the best neurosurgeon in the hospital. You joined my team before finishing your speciality. It's impossible that all my memories are a distortion. You should go home. The surroundings will help you remember. Gloria is my daughter. Lorena García. She died twelve days ago, in theatre. It had never happened you before. Nobody wanted to operate on her, but you took the risk. It was an impossible case, even for you. They prescribed sedatives, and a few days of rest. You returned this morning for Mr. Mendoza's operation, but we can extend your leave. Vera, you blocked out Lorena García, but speak of Gloria Ortiz, an imaginary girl you give life to. You made up David Ortiz as your husband because you've joined your first patient to your last. Your mind has drawn a circle. There must be another explanation. Which? Where are you going? Vera! What are you doing? What is it, Vera? Where are you going? - You're frightened... - No, no... I'm not scared. I'm starting to understand many things, really. What? The strange things, this entire situation started with the storm. - That might have changed everything. - Changed, how? What do you mean that you changed everything? Vera! Maybe I saved that boy. I have to know if he died or is alive. Why? To get my daughter back. Vera! Vera! Vera, open the door, please. Hello? Ángel, don't worry. Everything's under control. Do you want to try? Let's go! NICO LASARTE - MURDERED - 1989 NICO LASARTE IS A CHARACTER CREATED BY KAREN SARDON I've got you, bitch. - Relax. - Stop. Stop. You broke in. - No. - Stop. What are you doing in my house? Mine. What? - My house. - What did you say? And it was a boy's house, too. Nico Lasarte. I don't know what this is about. I just want to know if he's OK, where he is. - What? - There was a... an old TV and a camera. There was a connection with the storm. Everything changed. - Honey? - Love! Come up! - Are you OK? - I'm in the attic. - What happened the door? - They broke in, come up! Love... I can't believe it, you? Do you know her? She came to my office today. - What? - Call the police, tell them she's an intruder. David. - David, I need your help. - Stop. Don't move. Hello, I called a while ago because someone broke in. Ursula Abad. Stop. She came back in... David, listen to me. - Are they coming? - Yes, now. David, please. Stop using my name like you know me. We know each other. The police told me she was the one who removed the meningioma. - Are you a neurosurgeon? - No. I left neurosurgery when Gloria was born. You wanted to study a master to show your father you could be better than him. You didn't ask me to, but I supported you. Who is Gloria? Gloria is our daughter. What? I swear I don't know what she's talking about. I swear, she's lying. - Who the fuck do you think you are? - No, no! Leave me! Where is she, David? - I don't know. - David! I don't know! What is it? The whole street lost power. What is the police doing here? I don't know. Inspector Leira. - Hello. - Good evening. Is something wrong? No, we're looking for this woman. Have you seen her? - No. - No. Is she OK? Has she done something? She's just disoriented. Sorry. Good night. What is it, Mum? A crazy woman broke into David and Ursula's house and we think she hid at home. Don't worry, we're fine. I'll check on them and go to work. Haven't they cancelled the flights because of the storm? I've flown in worse, Mum. Tell uncle Roman to come tomorrow. It's Angel's birthday. Sure. We can confirm that the lock has been broken. Are you OK? Yes? Angel, it's me. Angel. - Where are you calling from? - The booth by your house. Alright, calm down. Calm down. Listen to me... you don't understand... I realised... my watch... in your house... I don't hear you well, what? My watch. - What? - I don't have my watch. I left my watch, I can't find it. - Your watch? - I don't have it. It must be in your house, on the floor. - You didn't take it? - No, I don't have it. - Look for it, it must be there. - OK, don't worry. If you left it here, it's here. OK? - Listen, do what I told you. - Yes, of course. I have the passport. We'll talk before you leave, OK? OK. I'll be at the bar near the airport. - I love you. - I love you, too. A lot. Mum? Aitor. Sweetheart... I have to go to Erejón for a while, to the new office. Uncle Roman will take care of you. I'll visit you as often as I can. Fuck! Who the fuck are you? Listen, I know what this car means to you. What the fuck do you want? You bought it from your uncle Roman while in flight school. Who are you? Your father was a military pilot, Armando, you hardly remember him. He died during a practice manoeuver. I don't know when the connection between you and I broke to stop me from meeting David and for him to stay with Ursula. Tell me how we supposedly met. In 2001. One day after the New York attacks. We took the same train every morning. I nearly always sat in the same place. Sometimes, like that morning, you sat in front of me. When we reached Valpineda station... - Are you OK? Are you hurt? - No, no... I'm fine. You stayed with me, we became friends and started to hang around. One night we went to the cinema... You met David and introduced me. - I'm Ursula - Hi. From the first time, I knew it would be him. What film did we see? We saw Castaway. I know you can't stand seeing planes crash. You made an exception, for me. No, that's impossible. You liked me a lot. Did I? I liked you and let you go. It was love at first sight with David. Right... Well... that was a great story. It's a pity it didn't happen, so... It happened. Pleased to meet you. You were on the train. But you didn't sit in front of me. For some reason you didn't sit in front of me. You should get help. I have to go. Wait, wait. What do you know about Nico Lasarte? Your neighbour, you studied together. What has Nico got to do with this? With Hilda Weiss. Angel's ex? Angel killed her. The boy saw it. He was run over. But I think I saved him, and that changed everything. I don't understand any of this, OK? But I know that Angel has been with my mother for 20 years. He couldn't hurt a fly. Much less Hilda Weiss. She left him. She didn't. She went with someone else after the wall fell. It's not true. That's what he made you think. That man killed his wife. It's my mother's husband, for God's sake! - Tell me about Nico Lasarte. - Enough! I have to go. Here. - You OK, nephew? - I'll tell you later. Today's guest is Karen Sardon, author of the novel Mirage, published 2 decades ago. In the novel, she describes how two symmetrical electrical storms occurred on November 9th, 1989, and today. - Welcome, professor Sardon. - Thank you. How could you know this would happen? Can you see the future, or does reality exceed the fiction? Well, like a magician doesn't reveal his tricks, a writer shouldn't reveal their inspiration. But to answer your question: No, obviously. I can't see the future. My book is based on a story I was told, about a boy with schizophrenia, his hallucinations were so real that they inspired me to write the novel. So this boy gave you the idea of the woman who spoke through the television. Not exactly him. His mother. There is a lot of coincidence in the story. You left this at the hospital. What are you doing here? You were at David Ortiz's house. He told me he knows Aitor Medina. He's a pilot, so I presumed you'd be here. TO NICO LASARTE Karen Sardon found this story through Nico Lasarte. His mother told her about him. But the hallucination was real. It was me. Please, let me prove that I'm not crazy. In fact, the mathematically interesting Hilbert spaces are vector spaces of infinite dimension. The type of Hilbert space necessary in each case depends on the system of... On nothing because class is over. For questions, you know where I am. For next week, read the theory of the cosmic web, by Richard Gott. Maria Lasarte came to see me because her son was convinced his life was saved by a woman from the future who appeared on his television. What the woman wanted to know was whether the electrical storm could have created a time-space warp, something like a video call in symmetrical parallel time. What happened to the boy? I don't know, she didn't tell me. I was only interested in all the questions that I could use in my book. Right, of course. You were only interested in your book. No. I sent him to a specialist. If you didn't have contact with him even then, - could you find him now? - No, I couldn't. Your book is pure fabrication, right? Yes, pure fantasy. But it's happening. The storm. I'm here. I remember Nico Lasarte. That doesn't prove that the woman from the future wasn't just in María Lasarte's son's mind. Or that Nico Lasarte ever existed. He might have existed only in the mother's mind. Like this book. It could be based just on my imagination. But I exist. I exist. I told you my story. And these photos exist, they're proof of this. Nothing proves anything. We are the ones who make sense of it. All we know is that the brain truly believes the experiences that we feel. It's function is to interpret a hallucination as if it were real. What do you think would happen if reality were just an illusion? So, given that under the same meteorological conditions, the connection would be possible, - how could we recover it? - Why do you want to? Why? To get my life and my family back. That's why. I don't know, but if it's possible, we would have to reproduce the exact conditions that occurred at the time of the first change. In the same place, with the same electrical connection. Can I see your watch? The original television, the camera and of course, during the storm. What if, even with all of these elements, the storm ends? The bridge would close forever. The storm started 53 hours ago. If it's symmetrical to 1989, it'll last 72. This is the time I have left to find my daughter. Will you help me? How? I need the old television and the camera. The Lasarte could have them. Searching police files can be very slow. I need judicial authorisation, and I won't get it with this story. - I need more. - Like what? Something convincing. Here it says he owned an abattoir and was going to bury his wife underneath it. Who confesses something he was going to do but didn't because he was arrested first? "VALPINEDA MURDERER" TO BURY WIFE AT ABATTOIR I think I've got it. Coffee? There's something I don't understand. You still don't believe me, right? Look. This is your past life. This is 1989 and this is now. If what you say is true, if there's really a gate with the past that allowed you to alter it, why are your memories still tied to a time that really no longer took place? Aren't you curious to know what your life is like now? But this is real. The body is real. It is also real that you and I are here because you have another life. A very real other life. This one. With people I'm sure care about you. I found the body. Now it's fair for you to help me. Inspector, the judge wants to talk to you. I'll be right back. This body changes everything. The judge's priority is to identify it, to be sure it is who you say it is. Meanwhile, you are as suspicious as the owner of the land. You don't have children, right? Someone who doesn't have children has time to do what they want. To be the best, but they also miss things. You asked for something convincing. Something real and I gave it to you. What else? Stay here. All units, I've lost Vera Roy. I repeat, I have lost Vera Roy. Report to me directly if she is found. My colleagues will back me up before the judge. When you leave, you're on your own. I've made some calls and revised credit cards. This is all I can offer you. BELMONTE HOTEL ROOM 1016 You found Nico Lasarte? I think this will bring you to him. Go before I change my mind. Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday, dear Angel, happy birthday to you! - Oh... - Blow harder! Well... David, where are you? Something is happening. Something related with that woman... - The body appeared... - I know, I'm watching it. No, Aitor flew to Dubrovnik, he'll spend the night there. ...the neurosurgeon Vera Roy informed... No, this is crazy. ...and then disappeared. I'm at the office. I'll be there in five minutes. - No further information... - See you soon. ...on the victim's identity, but unofficial sources ensure that it could be the former wife... Who was it? It was Ursula, I have to go. What is it? It's not her, the family of a friend, something happened. I have to go... Dinner. Don't escape. Dr. Roy? Monica? What are you doing here? They gave me this address and this room number. Can I come in? I'm not alone. I understand. Look... How can I help? I'm looking for someone called Nico Lasarte. Do you know him? No. He's not here? No, I don't know that name. So who are you with? That's my business. Look, Dr. Roy. I don't know what's going on, but we should call Dr. Fell. Where are you going? Dr. Roy, stop! I don't know who you're looking for, but I swear he's not here. David, I'm sorry. - I'll call the police. - You're not calling anyone. Right? How long have you been together? We're not together. I'm not talking to you. Since my operation. It's not what you think, I love her. But you're with Ursula. That's totally different. Tell me what you want and let's get this over with. Give me your hand. Give it here. I don't understand. If I only know you from the operation, why don't I remember? What does it matter? But I remember an entire life with you. And I remember every day I was pregnant with Gloria. I know why I'm here. You'll bring me to Nico Lasarte. - I'll bring you to the police. - Don't be a fool. You work in a bank. You have access to customers data. That is confidential. This is confidential too, I suppose. Good evening. - Good evening. - Good evening. Do you remember me? Because I really remember you. Yes? Inspector Dimas is here. Thank you. Let's start at the beginning. According to a police report from 1989, on November 11th a boy, your neighbour, Nico Lasarte, accused you of killing your wife. Good evening. Nobody believed him. It was your word against his, and you could prove your version. But what was a child's fantasy is today a reality. The events are from two days before, the ninth. The day the Wall fell and the world changed. According to your statement, that day your ex wife, Hilda Weiss, said she was going to visit a friend in San Narciso. ...the chance for Germans from the East... According to the report, you declared that your wife was preparing to return to Berlin. But I believe you lied. She never wanted to go back to Germany. And you accepted when she wanted to go visiting. You felt the decision was going to create the occasion. Something like that. Mum. Coming. Excuse me. You have a call. Hello. Honey, the road to San Narciso is closed for the storm. I have to spend the night here. OK, don't worry. - See you tomorrow. - Goodbye. Yes. She's not back until tomorrow. Clara, I promise to talk to her. Things will change, OK? Angel... I love you. I love you, too. Mr. Prieto. Tell me what happened that night. Did you kill your wife? What? My love! You scratched me... Ángel. Son of a bitch. Hilda please! Hilda! Hilda! Clara, no! Stop it, Hilda! Hilda! No... Did you kill your wife? Yes or no? Answer, please. I want to speak to my lawyer. I have the right to remain silent. This is the watch Nico Lasarte found in your house. The proof you had an accomplice. Nico Lasarte highlighted a detail about the watch. The details are important, Mr. Prieto. He noticed a small engraving. "CM." Can I see your watch? What? Your watch, please. Thank you. These are your current wife's initials. Clara Medina. The facts speak for themselves. Only she could act as Hilda, to make her disappear. And I suspect that you helped. Will it work? The guy who makes them is good. Do what I said, and don't make contact. These are assumptions, there's no proof. Nico Lasarte had the watch implicating your neighbour, Clara Medina, and you knew. So you found a way to get it back at the boy's expense. We'll talk before you leave. OK. I love you. I love you, too. A lot. What is it? What is it? What is it? I have proof. Are you sure about it? We have checked everything you've said. But we have a problem, kid. Your neighbour, Mr. Prieto, reported that someone broke in and stole a gold watch. He also says his wife left. She left him for an ex boyfriend in Germany, her home. Nico made a mistake. But he would never make up something he says he saw in Mr. Prieto's house to cover himself. The problem is that his wife's bank account shows movement in Berlin and we checked the list of passengers, she flied there. There must be an explanation. If my son... Your son, Ms. Lasarte, has told an incredible story. About a woman from the future who speaks through a television. That she gave him the information about Angel Prieto. We have to find the way to solve this misunderstanding. I can only think of one option. Relax. - Stop, Nico! Please! - I saw it! - Hello. - Hi. Is that my watch? Give Mr. Prieto back his watch. If you promise not to do this again, this will be our secret. We'll be at peace, OK? They moved away after a while, I didn't see him again. His mind wasn't right. That's the easy reading. Nico Lasarte made the mistake of mixing what he knew with a story about a woman from the future. That's why nobody believed him. We just need time for the forensics to prove that the body we found is your ex wife. Nicolás Lasarte. Then, Nico Lasarte, will have won the battle. Over 20 years later, but he'll have won. He was our customer, so was his mother and you say he lived in my house. Let's track his movements, find his address... Here, this must be him. Nicolás Lasarte Leira. The circle is closing, Mr. Prieto. I'll tell you what happened to Nico Lasarte. He got obsessed with proving he was right. All he had to do was to wait for the woman from the future to come back. He calculated the hours left in the storm, guessing that when it ended the gate would close. That's what happened. Something in the future had stopped any new communication. He only had questions, and his mother only wanted answers. Tests proved that he wasn't consciously lying. So the reason for his obsession had to be a mental disorder. His mother decided to get away, with the hope that some day he would be cured. But it was just the beginning of a long nightmare. First the psychologists, then psychiatrists. Then admission to a centre until he surrendered to their ideas. But not to himself. He denied the existence of Vera Roy so they would stop. But Nico Lasarte knew you were guilty. And he never understood why the woman who saved him once didn't come back to help him. So Nico Lasarte never forgot Vera Roy. The top floor. His post has been sent here for 5 years. Are we even? At the time, he didn't know her name, but he had a clue. So he followed it. And he waited. His future and past came together in that moment and he was frightened. Everything that had made him crazy to others, was becoming a reality in front of his eyes. He didn't know how to reach her, what could he say? How could she believe him when she hadn't experienced it yet? He stopped looking for answers and wished that she would never look for them, either. The flight of a butterfly can be very cruel if it occurs in a place and a time that allows for change. I was waiting for you. - Sorry. - Are you OK? Yes. I'm fine. Let me help. My name is Nicolás Lasarte Leira, Mr. Prieto. We live in a system that is chaotic, and drastically alterable. Nico asked me to come in case this happened. To help you remember. To remember what? It's best if you discover it for yourself. Where is she? Go home, Mum. I'm sorry. I've been stuck for two days. Since you came to the station and you didn't recognize me, talking about that life you had when I was a boy. It wasn't the life you had with me. It wasn't possible that you lived it because I changed it. By finding you. But you had those memories. And you had erased me. I let Dr. Fell interpret what was happening in his way, and I waited. With the hope that you'd remember. Remember us, Vera. I just wanted to understand my experiences as a boy and... why you hadn't come back. I couldn't know that when you were to meet Aitor, you'd meet me, and everything would change. I avoided you finding me, because I didn't want things to change again. Because I love you, and I don't want to lose you. I have feared this moment for years. I feared the day you would find our connection in our present. I imagined it all. All of the possibilities. But not that you would forget me overnight. That you would go back to a life you haven't lived. Because I changed it. Then the storm arrived. I need the camera and the television. I don't remember any of this. I dumped all of it. No. Someone broke into David's house. You broke in. It was you. To test the connection. You wanted to know. I would have too. Hello? Yes, I tried it. But I realised it was a mistake and disconnected. I couldn't risk a new connection altering my past and everything I did to meet you. But I let you find me. To see who David Ortiz really is, and to find me. You have to go back to 1989 and grow up without an obsession with me. You have to forget me so that you never have to find me. And you have to forget Angel Prieto, too. If they find him in the past that would affect Clara, that would affect Aitor, and I need to meet him, like I would have if you hadn't stopped it that's the only way to meet David and to get my daughter back. What if it doesn't work out? We can't control everything that might happen. - I'll take the risk. - No. Let me be your memory. Please. Please. Stay with me. Do you remember me now? This is real. This is real. We have to go back to 1989. No. No. I can't. No, I'm sorry. What are you doing? I saved you. Now it's your turn. Hello? Hello, Nico. Who are you? Listen to me. I'm you. You're me. Where's the woman from the future? You have to help me. Please. What I'm going to tell you is very... very important. Mum. - What's wrong? - Nothing. Are you sad? No, I'm very happy. Hey... This isn't a dream, right? What, Mum? I don't want you to move from here. Vera, love, are you OK? What is it, are you alright? I had a nightmare. Another one? What do you mean, another? Vera, you've been acting strange for a few days. Where...? Where are the camera and the television that were in there? There has never been a camera in there, or a television... Are you really alright? Vera. Where are you going? What's going on? Vera, you're frightening me. Where did you get the matches? Here we go again. From the hotel in Seville, don't you remember? It really happened. Angel is free. He kept his promise. Vera. OK, received. Would you like a coffee? Thank you. The inspector is here. Got it. Sir. A woman found a body. She hasn't said anything, just that it's the ex wife of the abattoir's owner. But according to our reports, she lives in Berlin. - Who is it? - Her. I want to know how you found the body, and why you think it's Hilda Weiss. I knew it would be you, Nico. Do I know you? Yes. You just don't remember yet.
