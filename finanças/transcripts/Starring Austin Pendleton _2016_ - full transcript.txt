[sil.] Okay, let's go. Well, let's fuck it. Well, look, here is what. Shit, I hate these things. You can never ever open them. Shit. Never once have I successfully opened a bottle by palm, and yet everybody else seem to be able to. Oh, well. Here is what I've got. Every time anybody tries to apply a rule to this business, it's full of shit. Because this business is too chaotic for any rule to make any sense. You want to work. You want to work at your... being an actor. And that's what any actor does if they are 80 years old or whatever. They were just... or 17 or anything in between. You want to work at being an actor, which is a process, it really doesn't never stop. And after a while, people just say, "Oh, he is still here." And then that begins to count for something. I mean, years have to go by before they started to saying that. And they spend a lot of energies, like, trying to beat your way with a baseball bat. But then they say, "Oh, is he still here? Yeah. We're at five, Austin. Maybe, you are at five. Okay. Okay. Jesus Christ. Almighty. Shut the door. If this guy didn't look the way he looks, he has got a stutter and he is, you know, fight whatever he is and he is funny looking guy and his hair is all screwy. He beat Marlon Brando. Come with a team. I'm sorry, I haven't come up to introduce myself, it's bad form. It's probably the excitement of meeting you for the first time. My heart is going mile a minute. By the way, you can just feel it pounding. Can't you feel it? Yes, I think I can. People in the universe who we think are celebrities and stars, they think of Austin in that caliber. I don't think that's quite a situation. I want an answer from you. I'll look at you, which will be a seldom's possible. He is the renaissance man. There can be no true art without living. He acts, he teaches, he directs, he writes. Look at there, I got him thinking, I got him thinking. You only have to watch his acting to know that he is a fan of working in a way that we likely all kind of dream of working. It's machine to silly. Look, you just press yes or no. But suppose my answer is maybe. There is no line between the man and his work. It's almost as if there are all these other actors in the play or the movie and then they dropped this real guy in the middle of everything. Can you see him? Yeah. Are you sure. On stage, he just stole the show, always. I've never seen anyone get more fan mail. The fan mail starts with you changed my life. We talk about Austin being the most famous unfamous person in the world, but the truth is he is actually quite famous, because he is famous in the right way, because of merit rather than notoriety. He seems to have a never ending source of energy. I'm saving your life, hop in. Everybody knows Austin, whether they met him or not. He makes the six degrees of separation thing kind of look like ridiculous, because it is more like one or two degrees and that is all I know. Life is an anecdote, this is really one amazing story really. Hi, AP. You're looking down there. People still call you AP? Oh, yes. You can have Cobb salad work again tonight. Oh, God. You live for this? I do. It could be said. It could be said. Yeah. Hi there. Yeah, great, great. Who wants pennies. Yes. [sil.] Don't tell anyone, but yeah, I gave Rachel a dime. [sil.] There, Louie. That gives you some idea of my admiration for you. Okay. I'm gonna sit places. Great. We'll go back to the same page, please. Hello, hello, my friend. I've been waiting for long time to see you. Gentleman, you've turned my study into a tavern again. I've told you all, one and all, a thousand times. Look at this, vodka is spilled all over my paper scrums. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. One thousand one hundred rules. Now you take it with you today, give it to her with your own hands and you say, Saritha Sarishna I hope you choke on it. Only be careful not to let them know that you got it from me, otherwise. Otherwise I'll give them my neck and goose break coutures. What? All right, okay. Never mind, never mind. We are here with Austin Pendleton, since making his Broadway debut in the original Fiddler on the Roof, he has had principal roles in over 30 movies, many TV shows and countless stage productions. He won an Obie for the The Last Sweet Days of Isaac, did Uncle Vanya with Steppenwolf Company and Shakespeare of Broadway and appeared in doubles in The Diary of Anne Frank on Broadway. In movie, he was the condemned man in the 1974 remake of The Front Page. A stuttering lawyer in My Cousin Vinny, a math professor in A Beautiful Mind, and a fish in Finding Nemo. He is also a play writer and a director. This is a place call Old John's. This is the place we are going to eat, this is the place to go to when you are working at Lincoln Center, and it's killing me. [sil.] I'm thinking of having a Fettuccine Alfredo with chicken, I better not, I'll get fat. The whole curse for actors today was turning out. They can't... they won't see if you don't have any credits or if you don't have... and you can't get any credits, because they won't see it. I think it was very harder when I started. I will go to agency and say, if you submit me into this plan, they would say what have you done. I would say, well, it is what I played in college and here are the little parts I've played as a leading star when I was an apprentice. They would say, you expect us to submit you to Jerome Robbins. One of the two or three great directors of that time. One of the two or three great directors of the 20th century, you expect us to submit you to Jerome Robbins for a leading role when you've done a few plays in college. It was an example of Lord saying, when God wants to punish you, it gives you what you want. I mean, I got the parts and then I don't know what to do with it. And because I was having such a trouble doing it eight times a week, I just couldn't do it. And the guy that cast, who is still a friend of mine said, he used to... I used to take the subway to go around the HB, an audition crew of Uta Hagen. He came and he set way for us. He said you got this part before you really knew how to act. A whole lot of actors that I known, have had the pleasure of knowing, they had this persistence. And sooner or later it starts to happen, but it is sheer persistence. And I think I would have exhibited the same persistence, if I had known that that is what we would be doing, simply because I didn't know how to do anything else. Once you step outside the narrowest circles of here, I don't know how to do anything, I really don't. [music] Do you think that Austin finds himself to be a success? Okay. So today we're just going to re-do, right? And then talk about it a little bit. Maybe I would say this before I answer directly, maybe that's been on and off. So you could hear Austin or is it so? This is perfect. Sometimes what the world might see is total fulfillment may not be quite enough. Hello? Hello? Up here. Who hasn't sat in front of an Academy Award ceremony, who hasn't in some ways either he said that's all over for me, that will never happen for me, or you might say, why hasn't that happen for me? Did you think that in beginning... you're going to walk into this... Or you might say, this is going to happen for me. I supposed to start on that movie tomorrow, but I'm starting on Friday instead. What movie is that? Oh, it's just a little movie, they are paying me $1.75 to do it. What? Is it like an internet movie? No, no, it's a movie, but you know... So I think it may be more than a $1.75. Well, not much. I mean, a $100 a day. Are you serious? Oh, whole lot of movies were like that. And then you get a deal on the backend when it becomes a blockbuster. But... and what they do to distribute these movies is, they put a DVD of it in a bottle and put it in the ocean I think, it's you know... It's really cruel to see these... with these fabulous casts and they go straight to the DVD, it's unbelievable. Yeah. Rebecca is doing a ton of movies like that. Yeah. I've done a whole lot of those since the mid-90s. I've even won awards for a couple of them. But I mean, if those movies had seen the light of day, we would be conducting this session on my yacht. Oh, my God, who's sweaters are these? You can take them if you want. Yeah. I remember being in New York, I don't know what I was doing there, because I was rarely there and I was waiting to catch a train on the subway. And I just ran into Austin. Of all people, you know, I didn't know anybody in the city and he had... oh, his hair was like this, you know. And he had some crumbs all around here and he had on a women's sweater backwards, buttoned up the back. And I said, oh, Austin, where are you off to? And he said, I'm going to a dinner party. [sil.] Mr. Austin Pendleton is in the house. Thank you so much for coming by. Thank you Sissy. I don't want to hold back Austin. Please don't. I can't, can I... Please don't. Can we relax? Can we have fun. Sure. Yeah. I'm so excited. And you guys probably have so much footage of people talking about the sexiness of Austin Pendleton. There were certain women waiting afterwards and we guys go, that's an Austin groupie. I think every single women in the acting business, in the acting world is in love with Austin. When we went to see Rosmersholm, there were like five women or something. Or it is less. It seems like groupies to me. Every women, every time you see, Austin Pendleton is like, Ahh. He is a sexy motherfucker. [sil.] Austin, he is part of the fabric of this city. He don't spend very long in the pool of New York Theatre without bumping into him. Every time I go to the theatre, I swear to God, Austin Pendleton is there. He just ran just to be everywhere. He is always being approached, not as a famous person necessarily, but just being approached. Wonderful job. Oh, thank you. Everybody is kind of just swarms around him. It's so nice to meet you, yeah. Thank you. Yeah. Hi. And if you bump into him, you are meeting this kind of magical elf. You know, who sends inspiration everywhere. You want to be in his presence. You want to hear whatever little gems going to fell out of his mouth. My name is Carl Kelsch. It was a pleasure to see you off tonight. Oh, thank you. He doesn't care about status or money or if you have an agent or if you don't have an agent. He doesn't care about how famous you were or are. He will be around somebody who is mega famous person and he will treat them exactly the same as he will to his intern. Oh, yeah. He doesn't have a guarded bone in his body. And because of that people gravitate towards him. And let's move very fast through this room, so we can go quickly to the bar. Okay. So we don't get involved in fourteen small talk moments. Yes, right. So here... Hey, David. Great show. Great show. You are wonderful. He is a magnet for people's curiosity and people's joy, and people were just thrilled to be with him. So what are you doing? Going down? Have a drink. You are going to have a drink? Well, I'll have a drink with you. Good. Will you? Sure. [sil.] The Austin Pendleton project. Oh, that the thing where they are going around and... Making a movie about you. Yeah. These... What do you mean that's that thing. Aren't you know that the cameras are following you. These two guys are so self-effacing. And just when you think documentary filmmakers are self-effacing, that's when you have to get aware, because that's when they catch you. Well, yeah. I don't like to think about it, because, you know, it's a... I mean, I'm happy, and who wouldn't be happy they are doing it. But I don't like to think about it, because you get else... you know... What do you know about Austin's personal life? Okay. I don't know anything about his personal life. He is a private person. He has a wife somewhere, does he not? And no one have seen her that I know. And that means something. We are trying to get together with Andrew we were going to shoot, maybe this week, but I think that he got busy. And it is... I hope that's okay with you? Just seeing Andrew. It's too late now. Turn that off. What's that? It's too late now. [sil.] I think it is downstairs. The first thing I do is go and get Austin's brunch, I guess you call it, which consist of some soup, some hand squeezed orange juice, two bananas, and double espresso and a half sandwich. The other half I eat. So... Hi. Hi. So that's the story, right. What? What's the story. I make the breakfast story. That's true. Every day of the year. Every Monday. Yeah, I understand. Not every day. That can be misconstrued. I started staying with Austin in 2003 and I have taken at least one class a week from him ever since. I got my equity card in 1967, so I give you some idea of how long I've been doing this, but I don't think I really became an actor until Austin taught me how. Oh, I feel sexy. What I really like about Austin's method of teaching is that, he is really interested in what we as actors bring to the table. What's wrong with me. I mean we've been fighting this for years. Look, I haven't... I haven't left you for a hairier person. Because we like each other. He teaches, gets underneath in a human way and I just have a huge amount of respect for him and that respect makes me work really, really hard. Okay. Good play. What did you say? I dropped a line. Oh, my God. Let me take a moment to recover. I would say, well, if this were on a Broadway stage, it would never fly. You know, I probably like, especially at the end, but we have to let go. Why? What you said that? Well, it was just, you know. It's much better than most of us here on the Broadway stage. Wow. [sil.] Thank you. Thank you. Oh, but in advance. Yeah. Oh, my God. How great. Thank you. Well I don't know where you live, but I know where you work. Yeah. Can I just hug you? Can I just hug you? Okay. Okay. I don't see you any more. I come home, you are going around some place. Why do you want to see, you can let somebody go? What is the matter? You're like him. No, it's just. I used to come home, you was always there. Now I turn around and you are a big girl. I don't know how to talk to you anymore. Why? I don't know, you are running. You are running, Katie. I don't think you are listening anymore to me. Then you should let him. What's the matter? You don't like him? Beautiful. Now, but you tell me why I'm wrong to say that. I don't know, I always feel unsound and unsure about that the whole scene, most part of it. That's not only part of it, that's the scene. Yeah, it's upsetting. Yeah. We go into acting to feel on top of things, right. That's the last thing we should feel when we're acting, because no scene ever written is about somebody on top of things. So the thing is how to use actively and dynamically and dramatically the fact that we don't feel on top of it. If we don't feel on top of it means we are in touch with something in the scene. It's so important to learn that. You know, it's a scary place to go for any human being, for me it's... That's why people write plays about it. Some of the audience can watch their worst nightmares happen in a controlled situation, a control being that the dialog is written out and all of that. But the actors have to somehow be in touch with that. All of us have things inside us that could ambush us at any moment. And it's when we are... we think we've got everything in hand that we relax our guard and that's when stuff happens. Okay. Another class? Ahh ahh. Another class? Yes. Then I have bad news, next two weeks I'm going to be gone, I've got a movie. I know I've already missed three or four classes, but I can't turn down this movie. Oh, what you're doing? An indie movie. This one I hope might possibly one day come out. Generally, they probably go to DVD or something. So who knows what this one could at least, I don't know. Maybe this one will get seen by somebody, you know. That too is what show business is about. May be someone will actually see this one. You know, I'm going to wash my hands. I wash my hands off the whole situation. Okay. Oh shit. Oh. Well, no, the soap thing popped right out of the container. When you push the soap thing to make the soap come out be very careful, because it just went boom and on to the floor. Okay now. You start acting and I work through my food. Okay. Austin and food is a whole dramatic experience. The way he eats food is not pleasant, you and your food around him is not pleasant. It is kind of like, I don't know, being around a hungry animal. He knows you bring food out that they are going to be attracted to it and they are ultimately going to come over to you and eat it. [sil.] You know, what I almost did, I almost grabbed a piece of bacon of that plate. I had a physical impulse, as plate just went by with some chips with bacon on top of it, I had a physical impulse just to reach and take it off and eat it. Like in a restaurant, you know, I walk by a table and there will be a bunch of French fries, people are eating, and I have to physically restrain myself from reaching and taking a bunch of French fries off of some total stranger's plate. See, this is weird, this is really weird. This is disorder. [sil.] They closed Barnes & Noble there. It makes me sad. I would actually go to Barnes & Noble and sit in the corner and read about theology. Something it wouldn't happen anywhere else. [sil.] There will be no room at all on this subway car, so we have to be brutal. [sil.] Maybe I'm just tired, you know, it could be just that. This... I'm tired. I should take it easy for a while. When was the last time you took it easy? The late 1980's, I remember, I took it easy a little bit, something like that. [sil.] We have transfers available for the A, C, E, and Kew Garden Meadow. 2, 3, 7, and Port Authority Bus Terminal. 32 years ago you could cheat me in a scene and some. Oh my God. Ladies and gentlemen, there is a... [sil.] If it had been something Tennessee Williams and I may act in it, we will be doing it every weekend, on Friday's through Monday nights. It's a great show, I love it. I love it because everyone in it has been one time or another a student over the years. Yeah. Some of the best students that I've ever had. Yeah. Hi there. Hello. Hi there. Hello. Hi. Hi. Hello. It's the superstar himself. It's the superstar he is facing. It's the great Austin. Yeah, that's right. Excuse me. [sil.] Who is this? I'm going to shut the door. Sure, this is embarrassing, but we have to, you know. Well, this could be the section that would sell a movie. But I didn't close, I wouldn't do the nudity in rehearsal at all, not until the dress of so-called rehearsal, because we were rehearsing in the basement of a church and right in the next room was a daycare center. And I just thought some kids going to run around and say, mommy, mommy, the man from The Muppet Movie was naked today in the basement of a church. Then how was it getting naked on the stage for you. You guys ready? It was fine. In that play, you express long scenes. And so you just forget about it. It's really weird. In fact, everyone saw on the middle of... there is a scene where there is ...there are scenes actually once it happens, where it's never even referring to. And you are in these intense arguments with people and you suddenly, I forgot to put on my clothes. How are you? I'm good. I'm still dealing with a little stomach thing, had ulcerative colitis, but it's getting better now, I'll be back in your class before you know it. I can't wait Yeah, me too. Thank you. All right. Yeah. We are totally sold out, we are over sold. We have mats out, we have put all the backstage chairs out, so everyone showed out tonight. [sil.] He certainly has this quality of just absolute reality and authenticity. There is never any actory thing with him. I've observed a play that he has directed with his students. And what I noticed in that play was that same quality of reality that he somehow imparted to his students. It was like it was really happening in front of you. You know, the artifices are all gone. And I don't really know how he does that. [sil.] Hello. Just went on... like, thank you very much, just want to... so much... Thank you. We saw, also Ivana... Yeah. We just had a chance to really talk to you, but it was just wonderful... We talked for a little bit after that, didn't we? You were surrounded with... No, not that day. I think... No, I just said thank you, but you were surrounded by people and I'm sure you didn't notice. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Just, yeah. But, it's just brilliant. Thank you so much. Thank you. Yeah. I know it was backstage at Sophistry. It was like, me, Ethan, Steve Zahn, Anthony Rapp and Austin sharing a dressing room that was about this big. And Austin, as I recall, he's like, came in, Austin was there and he sort of standing, my tidy whitey isn't t-shirt, like, and he just didn't look happy. Yeah. In the New York Times magazine was this picture of Jeff Bridges, and he said the most underrated actor in America. Jeff Bridges, America's most underrated actor, he is on the cover of the New York Times magazine. I'm sitting here in this shithole and with fucking students. I'm America's most underrated actor. Fuck Jeff Bridges. This guy gets paid a million bucks a movie. This guy, you know, goes does... goes to parties with Jane Fonda. The fuck I have been doing the hard work my whole life, I'm the most underrated actor in America. And this kind of ego came out of him that I had never seen. It was a completely absurd headline. And he called that out what it was and it really got under his skin. In a film he'd enjoy to see, because I started to think he was, you know, perfect. And he was just so enlightened all the time and doing everything for the right reasons and I was like, "Oh, wow, there is some passion there." You know. These guys work hard for everything he is. Do you have any separation between yourself as an artist and any... is there any other? No, I don't. I never had since I was a kid. I never could imagine anything else. We are talking on the late 1940's I know what. And I didn't even know how it was going to happen or anything. I got the idea of being in theater and by extension film and so forth, way early on and it was an 8-day fix and it was complicated by the fact that when I was young I literally couldn't talk. Come up. Come up and read. This summer... I had a real, real serious problem with speech. It's like these athletes who you find out they were crippled when they were kids or something, and you just get... it's all about trying to get free of that, and you don't want to put energy into anything else. When he was a little boy he said to his mother, they are making fun of me, they are making fun of me, telling about his contemporaries, his fellow students. And she said, so what? So what? Well, there is a fiber in that answer, isn't there? What are you thinking? I wish I were dead. I don't think you'd give up that easy. So what in the case where a person is sort of asking for sympathy. And so what is a way of, phew, going right over that and continuing to live and to function. And people would say, Austin, about you are being an actor. I would say, I'll do a lot of workout, and you know. It... I've never... it replaced like everything, except actual personal relationships in my life. I'm and Austin going to the theater and I said, how the things are going? He said, okay. And he says my mother is coming to see the show. A classic example of a stutterer. And what does he stuttered with the name, I was my mother. They came to see Austin in everything. In everything. And very often a drive from Marion, Ohio, they miss nothing. I know that I've experienced his stutter when it was worse and when it was not quite so bad. And I may be reading into this, but the time when it was worse was when his mother came to see him. My last psychiatrist told me that stuttering is some conflict between expressing yourself and holding back, whatever that means. That would have been enough to stop many people. And he just continued, just... he just continued to work on it and find his way, and... It was pretty amazing to see you would just have a moment with a particular word and... ...would just choose another word to say. He's always got a little piece of himself concentrating on will he stutter, will he not... how he'd cope with it, will he put these words together. That's a really scary thing. As an actor, it'd be like, I could get stuck in hundreds, thousands of people watching me to have that challenge and be like, fuck it, I'm going to go on stage every night and I don't care. What kind of actor would I become if I didn't have this problem? Not so interesting one. Today, I would say about turning down One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. He is like so funny, he didn't want to be defined as a stutterer. Well, now, ladies and gentlemen of the jury. The director of My Cousin Vinny was an old friend of mine and he send me the script and said, will you do this? I said, is this a sick joke? On January 4th of this year, my client... And I thought it will be... although it's an exclusive script, it will be a little cult movie, little that I know would turn into Gone with the Wind. It's like... it's everybody's favorite movie. It's like, you know, to this day. I've made a hundred movies, this is the one they are going to remember. And I did it as a favorite of my friend, because he got me drunk. Coincidental. Thank you. I went into acting to get away from stuttering. And here I'm going to be remembered for it, it's like it's a cruel joke. What about everything we talked about? No, I got little nervous. A little nervous? I'm getting better. A student of mine who is an older women asked if she could have dinner with me a couple of years ago and she said, I just wanted to... she had a some... I don't know how anyone ever gets over this. But in the early '90s, her 13-year-old son, he died in great pain from the brain tumor. She said, when he was dying and he was in pain he just love to watch My Cousin Vinny and he loved your scenes. And that's something in me shifted at that point. I said, you can't... that's fantastic. Irreplaceable. Yeah. Whatever your own personal things about our totally evaporate in front of something like that. It's like, I said, oh, thank you for telling me that. I'm horrifying that that happened and thank you for telling me that. I mean, it's like you do the work and then it's out of your hands. Do you get your... do you get pedicures? No. Beautiful finger nails. Thank you. So clean. And you do it yourself? Yeah, I do it myself. Oh, multi-talented. The simplest theory is usually the correct one. The correct theory is that I was thinking too much to function properly and then I had this wild dream, you were acting me in play about my life, terrible play, and you were terrible because of the booze. A dream to replace the drink, I think. See, see, it's a proverb ending in ain't, pretty naught thing. It Don't Mean a Thing If It Ain't Got That Swing. If It Ain't Got That Swing. Two Gallants have said that baby. You know your music. I do. I think you are just exotic. All right, great. Faith of luck. You are released. Steven, will you read the man's line from the rehearsal. Certainly, read this. Austin, Thank you, Austin, that was wonderful, and we'll try to get and tomorrow we change your direction. I was going to ask, did we get any good commercial? No. We got commercials and it is going to conflict and we can't get up to do the commercials. No one in Los Angeles has ever even thought of pushing me for anything like a Jessica Lange. What does that mean in Jessica Lange? That kind of movie where... about real people and you are not playing some absentminded professor. It's all in the name of science, Charlie. Definition of being a character actor, one is, you are not the star of the movie. We have very little time, Mr. Larry. Who are you people? You play something that supports the tech, supports the stars. Nothing. Nothing. What does that mean? You dressing him smaller, you get paid less. It is precisely the moment where the mutation or beast will attempt to kill an unlikeable side character. The film being a visual medium demands beauty. I'm perfectly sane and sound. You just have to look certain way, you have to look good enough for people to want to look at you for two hours. If you don't look satisfying for two hours. Mind is the true face of vampires. I get all these parts particularly in TV and stuff like that, playing people who speak scientifically, I never know what I'm talking about. This is an ABX technocraft. I learn it by wrote. Austin, he is not being exceptionally good looking, he is not being exceptionally poetic. Help, I'm stuck, I'm stuck. He is not being exceptionally heroic. Just come on out. Oh, I can't my legs are asleep. Those are all virtues. I won't sing and I won't dance. Don't ask me. There is something about it that pigeon holds us successfully enough, so that when you think of absentminded professor, Austin volley into other people's show. I have almost never been cast as a normal human being, because they are not sure that it would be believable. [sil.] I would not be cast as a President of the United States. Get off my plane. I'll be more likely actually to be elected President than to be put in the role of President in a film. I don't think that anybody wants to be a character actor. Why don't you give me half the money you were going to bet. Then we'll go out back, I'll kick you in the nuts and we will call it a day. Secretly we all believe ourselves to be complete human beings. You know, I'm just trying to survive. You know, I mean, I'm just trying to earn a living, just trying to pay my rents and my bills. Both Austin and I whatever part we are given, we are trying like lawyers for the characters we play to make a case for ourselves as complete human beings. Whatever the part, and I've played creatures were not even human, but I'm try to make the case that they are fully human. Anything else you need, come see me personally. As a character, you always have their kind of beating the bush and being very happy to accept what you're given. Curse you AquaScum. His high get the big box. I still have people who will stop me in front a multiplex for say maybe two movies I may not playing, they say, do you ever act anymore and you don't want to say you don't want to get... you don't want to get defensive, you don't say, right there. I. What? She can't possibly understand me. She can't possibly understand me. I'm sorry, if you... my head is spinning. I understand nothing. Either I'm going along with my old age or suddenly everyone is becoming more cleverer than... I've been damned to understand any of it, any of it. In this scene, that the two of you is beautiful, is just beautiful, the two of you, yeah. What do you feel? There are times when I feel a little unsteady. Is that okay for you if I used a cane? Please. Really? Use a walker, if you want, I don't know. Okay. Use a wheelchair. Okay. Yeah. And there are times when I move my... when I turn or something. Yeah. Don't even make it an issue. All right. Thank you. Yeah. Absolutely. Yeah. It couldn't be less important. This floor is too flat. Yeah, I spoke to them about that. Yeah. All right. Yeah. No, I'm not. I spoke harshly to them, but they would have none of it, what can I say. Windows is checking for a solution to the problem, see, it just totally fucked the next five minutes of my life. I was going to just finish out some e-mail. How great. You love... No, I'm gonna to take a pee, I'm just ...oh god, I can't deal with this. [sil.] Hey, this... I hope I've the right number, this is for... this is for Daniel Demello. This is Austin Pendleton. He has my number. I want him to... I'd love it if you would invite to Small Craft Warnings John Simon, the critic, and it's really... it's important to me and I know that... that... I know that John Simon wants to see it and he's of course a great critic. But, thank you very, very much. Okay, bye-bye. Okay, so that I've done that and he will hate it probably, John Simon, but still I don't care. I've sometimes gotten into trouble for being what they call too personal, which in fact was just being too tough. He didn't enjoy my acting very much, the first Britain play that I had that was done in New York, he said it's got lot of great things and it has flaws, but we mustn't dwell on the flaws, we must encourage him, Austin Pendleton, as a playwright, anything to keep him off the stage. John Simon's review of Austin and his play where he was playing, you know, and a legend, molester of a student of his, and an alcoholic, it was Austin Pendleton for once well cast. And my feeling is that if you give a terrible review to somebody, if the person is a real artist, he can live with that, he can transcend that. I get really paranoid anywhere about reading reviews. If they are bad, I'm afraid that it might shoot a hole in what I go out and do every night, but even worse is if they're good because then you try to do what you just seem described, you know, in a review. The only safe thing to do is to pretend that critics all is important and maybe they are, but if you take them very seriously, then you are in the position where really bad review that you might get, you have to take just as seriously as the favorable ones and you don't want to do that, that's only human and understandable. I think you don't want to depend too much on criticism and by saying you don't read it or by actually not reading it, you establish your independence. There is the two of us and a sister who is five years younger than Austin, four years younger than me. And I think throughout our lives, there's been a fundamental compatibility and bond, and that endures today. Austin had this passion for theater from a very early age and sort of swept everybody along with it. So, he started his own theatre company such as it was in our basement when he was, what, eight years old or ten years old, is what I'm thinking, and he was put on these extraordinarily, extravagant productions and then I would get roped into playing parts very badly in those and Austin's whole circle of friends developed around this theatre. And did you expect that he will be as successful as he is. Oh god, yes, absolutely, no question about it. I'm kind of disappointed he is not more successful. You're right, exactly. We are here. Welcome. Terry, hi. Look here, here is our name, THE FRANCES M PENDLETON STAGE. The M is... the M stand for Manchester. If you need me to turn the stage lights on, I'll be happy to do that. Sure. Here's the theatre that they built with their bare hands. It's a Quonset hut, as you see. It's one of the best theatres I've ever worked in, just as a theatre, as a place to put on a play. So this is where you directed your ...I directed... in The Glass Menagerie in 1965, after my contract in Fiddler on the Roof was up. That was where Hal Prince had produced Fiddler on the Roof and he said, 'are you going to renew your contract?' And I said, why am I in a buying, because I'm now being asked to go out direct my mom in The Glass Menagerie in Warren, Ohio, at our... the community theatre she is part of. He said, 'you have to do that'. I said, 'but I don't want to leave Fiddler on the Roof, it's like leaving this secure place, you know. He said, 'well, I'll tell you what, I'll make you a deal. You go out and you do that, and then you can come back into the show. And in... in the three months or so you're gone, we will have your understudy play the part. And my understudy was Leonard Frey who then played the part in the movie of Fiddler and got an Oscar nomination for it and was beloved in that part. I happened to have that program. Oh, you do. The Glass Menagerie. Yeah, oh my god. Here is how she build herself as an actress, Mrs. Thorn Pendleton. She was this weird mixture of a feminist before her time and a total non-feminist. Oh, my god, that's mom. Alec is this picture is 28 and I'm 30, 31, yeah. We were late bloomers, yeah. I acted here too under her direction a few years after that in The Seagull and... What were you in The Seagull? I was Konstantin Treplev. Katina, my wife was Nina. And also our dad was in a whole lot of productions that our mom directed. He wasn't in anybody else's productions. I don't think... I don't think he was, no, no, he never did any lines. Yeah, well, he would have lines, but he would learn them just in sequence, he didn't know what the cues were. So, whenever there was pause, he would say his next line. So, our mom's productions were known for their electric pace because people were afraid to take a pause because he would just say his next line. And then... he would... then he would hear the cue come up in the dialog and he would say his thing. He was actually pretty good, he was really good and he was in the production of The Seagull that Katina and I were in and he had a lot of lines in that, in The Seagull. Did he? Yeah, and he would... there were scenes where he talks to the actress, the character who is the actress in the play, and you know, Ann Kim Harry, and he would, he would say, 'oh my damn, you're a marvelous actress, you're the greatest that I... he would turn and rehearse them, say them out to mom and the audience, all those lines, his name was Thorn. She would said, 'Thorn, talk to her, not to me.' 'I'm sorry, I'm sorry', you know. She would say things to me like during The Seagull rehearsals like, 'Austin... this is in front of the whole cast, 'I'd told these other actors you are a professional', a thing... without any evident humor in her voice. But she was also... I mean creating... she was also a whole lot of fun. She was an extraordinary woman in many ways. And she was very kind to people and all that, but she had a tart way of speech, wouldn't you say Terry? On occasion, yes, I would say that. Yeah, yes, she would. And I have to say the results that she got on the stage... Were electric. From absolute amateur actors who were in indeed electric. Yeah. They were fine productions. Okay. [music] Hi, Peg. Hi, Austin, how are you? Just that I have to give him a hug. Good to see you. Good to see you. This is my friend, Tensin Ascuda. Hi, nice to meet you. Nice to meet you too. She is an aspiring actress. Oh. And she's gonna sort of hang with you and make sure you're okay there and then she will bring you to the green room... Okay. At 6 when we're ready for you and... Excited to be back? Oh, yeah, yeah. [sil.] Hi. Hi, guys. Hi. How are you? Oh my god! I was so glad that you're here. It's so wonderful. Thank you. Watching and following your work for a long time, ever since The Last Sweet Days of Isaac. Oh my god, yeah. Yeah. Thank you. I'm Stephanie Corrianno, it's wonderful to have you here on our town. Thank you, Stephanie. Thank you. You're a wonderful actor. What? You're a wonderful character actor, wonderful person, just... follow your work. Thank you. My Cousin Vinny. Oh, thank you, thank you. One of my favorites. Thank you, thank you, yeah. [sil.] What quality do you think you took from your mother and what quality you think you took from your father? I really don't know, because I don't know, they both, as Alec said they were both very energetic, career-driven. They had their issues as everybody does, but they actually set it both in two different ways, they try and put over their issues, you know what I mean. They lived very productive lives although they were both, you know, they both had stuff they struggled with. And I think that... I think that all three of us, that was kind of an inspiration because you can tell they were in trouble, I mean just each of them individually, but they just... I don't know they carried on. Okay. [sil.] Hi. There you are. Hi. [sil.] Oh, my... Yeah, I know. It's amazing. Yeah. Look here. That was our house. Oh, your house? Yeah, when we lived out there a little... in the early 1950s and then we moved to Atlantic Street. Okay, alright. Yeah. And this was your living room. Yeah, yeah, right, in... out in the country. Yeah. Yeah. As far as I ever got was the front of the... front door, I never got inside. Yeah. I've a major problem at home. My mom, she has MS and she is bedridden. And my dad, he is taking care of her. He is a nurse's aid and he has no income right now. Wow. So, I'm just trying to... helping my mom every day, you know. Oh, yeah. And I don't really have much of a life ...I've been living a lie basically... How do you mean? There's nothing inside, I need something to bring me back to life. Yeah, like what? An actor. Yeah. I love acting. Would you be free to go out and work with TNT? You have to start somewhere. Right. And this group is really good, really good. That's where I started, you know. I can introduce you to somebody here. Yeah, yes sir. Okay, let's see Terry Gilbert is whom I'm looking to introduce you. Terry, talk to this young man. Hi. I got a terrible review in The New York Times for Yahgo where the whole first half of the review was about me and then the other half said, 'on the other hand, there are some good things'. It happened that my mom was at the performance that night on the evening of the day the review came out. And my cousin came to see it with her and my cousin told me afterward that... that she and my mom were in their seats after the performance and they were going to wait for me to come up. And some person past them and wasn't aware that she was my mom and he said to whoever he was with, 'God, the Times was right, Austin Pendleton is terrible.' And my mom said, 'just a moment', and she never revealed she was my mom. She just said, 'you don't know what you are talking about'. [music] Is there any food? Anywhere? Do you have any food laid out, anywhere? Let me get some food for you. Yeah, okay. I'm going to take a shower. And I'll wait. Yeah, hi. Hi. Excuse me. Hi. Hi. How is it going? Did you have a good flight? Well, it was eventful, let's put it that way. You're here now, that explains enough. Yeah, right. Hey, Sean. Yeah. Yeah. I haven't been in here since I acted it here as Yahgo in 1997. Wait, this doesn't make any sense that it would be dark down there. I am now retracing my steps. You know, it's up this way, this way. I think what they have done up here is a... is a homeless shelter. [sil.] Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no, no, no shit. I can't... oh no, oh, this is terrible. Let's see. Maybe you should ask someone in there. Hello? Yeah. [sil.] Oh, this is bad news here. This is a very small plane. oh yeah. [sil.] There. I'm a new man. I'm a new man. (inaudible) . [sil.] One of the things that separates Austin from everybody else is his incredible inability to give into bitterness. He once told me as something that Joseph Pappa told him that, how you most easily define success is by how you handle your disappointments. And Austin has handled his disappointments in his life with tremendous grace. [music] He went through a period in New York where it was very, very difficult for him. It's as if the critics did not want him. They wanted him to stay in a box, they wanted him to play only certain parts. And anytime he try to do something else, they would just land on him like a ton of bricks, and what did he do, he just went wherever people will let him play the great parts. He will act in the things you don't even know where he is, like he says, like... I know he's only in some place, somewhere, whether it's Broadway or 99C House or someone's house. Austin, what's with that cup? It's a cup that somebody gave and whenever I go into a coffee bar and I get espresso or anything, I just pour it in here, well, like just now, I love it. It's things from Alice in Wonderland, somebody gave it for me. Really? In this business you go through a lot of downs that are... that seem to be definitive, that seem to be like, 'forget it, that's it'. And so, you have to develop a way of looking at things that can get you through that. When my carrier kind of collapsed in the late '70s, I started to get offering these great parts in showcases like in the place where you got tonight. I started to being asked to do these great classical roles. I used to be told, 'don't ever do a showcase, it makes it ...it makes you look bad. The fact that you've done it, that fact that you will freely do it'. In the world we all came up in, in the '70s, theater was a religion, but how you made it was your mission. Austin never lost the mission. It's not a work ethic, it's a work necessity. If you do a showcase, somebody is going to see it. That's the only thing that will get you through all this, that that's the only thing that could be important. And if you say, 'well, I'll harder on this because it's more hope, high profile than I work on this', then... then you have already begun to throw it away. You've thrown away the one thing that's the only thing that's ever going to get you through. I've been in a whole lot of movies that no one has ever seen, just to pick up a little cash, just so that I could then go back and be in some more of these showcases. Very important people to me early in the work, important teachers, important people I knew kept saying, 'it's about the work, it's not about anything else'. You know what, I have to go, I've to go and sleep. Good night. Are you going to the opening night? I guess there's a party or something like that, after a few minutes, I hate those things. Yeah. Everybody is looking at their phones, wondering what the reviews are, I just hate it. I really don't believe it but you know, I cannot show up. That's our first song in that show. [sil.] It was fantastic. Yeah, enjoyed it. Thumbs up. Thank you. [sil.] Hi, Josh. Congratulations. Thank you. I hope you've been okay. Having a great evening. Oh my god, wait, food. I need to give you a huge hug. Where... is that wine or... You want a sip of my champagne. Where is the champagne? Let's get you some. Yes. Congratulations, can we get you to do some photographs on the other side. Sure, sure. Somebody is getting you a glass of champagne. That's all I need, yeah. We will bring it to you. Take one just together. I've to be in the picture with him? Yes. I thought my... I thought they had read my contract right, no; no. [music] Thank you. Oh, wait. Oh, thank you. [music] The quintessence of Pendleton. I guess we will hear the reviews. Does the Times come out tonight? Oh yeah, the Times will be up within an hour or so. How will this party find out about it? Some person will look on their phone. And then people will start avoiding us. Yeah. There is the moment at the party when everybody is looking at each other strangely. Well, sometimes you don't really care, even if it's show you love, sometimes you just say, 'well, whatever' and other times you get nervous. It's been like that all the way along. We worked so hard on it for three years, you know. What are your... what's your hunch? I've learned long ago not to have a hunch, you just don't ever know. Thank you, Jack. Nobody forces you to go into this business, so you can't even complain, you know they didn't tell me there would be critics, you can't say that. [sil.] Yeah. Austin is the most famous guy right now. He doesn't know, he doesn't remember, 30 years ago, April 19, when I interviewed you at the Little Foxy, I told him he was going to be the most famous director in the world as he directed Elizabeth Taylor for the first time she ever stepped on stage. I'm so drunk and happy, I'm just going to go. Okay, bye. Bye. You're the best part of this whole thing. Oh, thank you. Thank you so much. It's good. What's good? The New Times, it's up and it's good. What? It's good? What? What? What? Yes, I've just been told, I haven't read it, I've just been told. Small stirrings of the heart and mind evoke delicate musical responses in A Minister's Wife who lovingly composed chamber musical that opened on Sunday night at the Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater at Lincoln Center. The musical moves with a gentle step keeping an intimate focus on its central characters as they circle one another in a cozy London study that becomes the site of a well-mannered moral and intellectual boxing match, conceived and directed by Michael Halberstam and Austin Pendleton wrote the smartly condensed book, the creators of A Minster's Wife are aiming for something closer to the original. Congratulations to you guys, you guys need to. What did you get? We got Aces, but the crapshoots, don't take it seriously. That's true, but still I can see it your eyes. But still it's nice, it's very nice. Alright. Don't, be careful. Always be careful. Yeah. You never know. Because the next time out, he won't like what you do. Who knows that if there would be a next time. Yeah, right. Yeah right, I know. Correctly they say to me right now is, 'fuck the next time'. They either get what you are trying to do or they don't, and that's the life in show business. Welcome to our career. Thank you. It has its ups, it has its downs. You're right. Ladies and gentlemen, we are back please, we are back and we are at the top of act four, top of act four, please. Thank you. Okay, stand by, upright, go. Listen carefully and with all due respect of course and you, the mademoiselle demands attention with your intelligence and compassion doesn't even understand her own father. I've been an actor for, I mean, say, and I don't remember, almost 55 years. Put a wick in your mouth, light it and go breathe fire on everyone. During a lot of those 50 years, I've worked with him frequently, acted with him, directed him. He is almost 90, but he was still I thought at the peak of his form. I just came off a knee operation. I just want to, let's see. In other words I was saying, take it day by day by day. And then one day in rehearsal I was sitting and Ethan Hawke comes behind me and I turn the greet him and I fell. Hello. Oh! Oh, Jesus Christ! Too much vodka? Too much vodka. And everybody went, oh my god, oh he fell. How are you? I'm okay, no, I didn't hurt myself, it was just... it was the funny way I turned, that's all, yeah. Story of my life. No, she isn't. Characters in the play need to... We started talking about my balance was not that good. So, they just... we will get you a wheelchair and I felt uncomfortable wheeling myself around the stage. So I said to myself, 'what am I trying to prove?' So I told Austin this, look, I don't think I could go on with the show. He said, I don't think you are going to believe this, but I don't want to be in the show. I said no, I don't believe it because you are fucking brilliant. And we get emails, 'I saw this show tonight, this guy was magnificent'. He just gets to the heart of things. Never seen servant died, suddenly for some reason he wants to marry you, oh... never mind, never mind, I'm just an old crow, that's what I am, I am... Who is going to do it? I said, well, they want me to go and do it, but I'll tell you why I'm going into it. If I... if you change your mind in a couple of weeks and I'm doing it, all you have to do is lift the phone and you will come back again. When I talked to Austin about it, he says, if for some reason after you leave the show and you think about it and you want to come back, you're welcome, and I said no, no, no, no. My head is spinning, I am so confused, dare hell with you, no, I don't like it, I don't like any of it. And he has told, now it's over, I'll act in film and TV, but not in theater, I'm going to get him back. The fair Ophelia, O treble woe. Hold off the earth awhile. Till I have once more caught her in my arms. What is he, whose grief bears such an emphasis. This is I, Hamlet the Dane. I'd made two movies with Phil, one of them is the Fifteen Minute Hamlet. Phil is sublime in that movie. Austin gave me my first two jobs out of college which were probably two of the most significant jobs I've had till now. Our audition for him for the Williamstown, a non-equity company, I had to give two speeches on contemporary and a classical and I tore my pants. I went to sit down in a chair, very much like this chair and my pocket caught on my... caught on that arm of the chair and like tore it significantly, like it's eight inch opening gap in the side of my pants and I thought, oh god, that's a disaster. His contemporary piece was the final speech of Tom's from The Glass Menagerie and of course one has heard that speech 400 times. Phil did it, it sounded like he was making it up, it sounded like no one else had ever said this. Right from the get go, meeting him in that audition, there was no preconceptions or judgments or biases, it felt like, it felt like he was just kind of accepting me and my terms. For a while he was... he told that to interviewers and they would... and they would call me up. They would say who? Yeah, right, yeah right. They'd say, did Phil, there was a crazy actor and he was attributing his career to you. And that's Philip Seymour Hoffman is... and I would say this sounds like, aw, shucks or something, but it's just the truth. I would say to them... I was the only one in the room when he auditioned. I would say anyone who is in that room who didn't pick him truly does not belong in the business. I damn remember really thinking like, I think I might get this job and it wasn't because I thought I like nailed the audition or anything like that, I thought I... did something happen in that room, that was quite positive to me, and if I didn't get that job, I felt like I think I'm going to meet that guy again. And so, I would... it's not about my talent or about what I do. I think it's about how people think, you know, what people want to see and how they work. Because I went through something when I was so young, at a time I was so scared and so anxious, and so full of fear and I walked into a room and he was sitting there and he gave me comfort. [music] Do you think about your legacy? No. I think of trying to be bad as infrequently as possible. You know, I'm famous in... to a lot of people as that guy. He's an actor. Thank you. What? Oh, you're an actor? There is... there's one school of thought, yeah, right, yeah right. I've seen your movies. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. You asked about a legacy, you want to leave behind you as little carnage as possible. Is it three? Yes. I would get very freaked out if any kind of search light would turn on the life of myself and the lives of people who are close to me, I really would. If people are watching you do your work, either your direction or your acting or whatever plays you write, whatever, even your teaching, and they are not only watching what you're doing, they are computing things they know about your life, I think that's too bad. Has my daughter showed up? I don't think she has, actually. Hey, how are you John? Good to see you. Is Austin successful depends on what you mean by success and in this culture unfortunately people mean famous by success. Success is a really interesting concept which, you know, all of us wrestle with in some fashion or other. I need a cell phone, I have to call my daughter. Thank you. To the large public, he may not be well-known, well, I'm not sure that he cares about that. I don't think he is an overwhelming success, but I don't think he will need to be an overwhelming success. There is no quote making it, because if there was a quote making it he would have made it seven or eight times already. Whatever I've managed to accomplish or figure out, that little bit has been through the result of Austin Pendleton's teaching and I'm not the only person in this country or the world who will tell you that. No, I'm looking for my daughter. When it comes to art and when it comes to theater, he knows that that's where his life is. I just think he is going where the work is. My experience of Austin Pendleton comes way before he ever knew where I was. I was in college. I was assigned Oh Dad, Poor Dad, which I could not figure out what the fuck the sign was and I remember going to the front and going, who plays this part, and it is Austin Pendleton. I am like, Austin Pendleton, Austin Pendleton. My next six soldier was I got into (inaudible) then I was like, who's this sound? Austin Pendleton. I started noticing this weird thread developing about Austin Pendleton. So then my wife was offered Uncle Vanya and said I decided Austin Pendleton is directing it. Not only did he have to do that, I was like, I have to be in that with you like desperately, desperately. I was like everything's going to come together. It seemed to be like a thing I never have told Austin about any of this (inaudible) on direction and... He's just a very brilliant, colorful, kind, patient person. Growing up, he would say, 'figure out what you love and the rest will fall into place'. I hoped that will unsettle me and I am still teaching medical students and residents and assessing patients and I'm still you know contributing something to both the field and the people of my life and if I could add any fraction of the impact he's had, that to me is being successful. Ladies and gentlemen, Austin Pendleton. [music] Okay, that's doesn't mean I'm going to start at the beginning of my career and go all the way through it, but that reminded me of a moment, when I was in Oh Dad, I got this extraordinary role in this play. Three months after I came to New York through a series of kindly flukes, the only factor that had been left out of this whole equation was that I did not yet know how to act. I had no real training, about a month into the run, I just began to unravel. I must state, it wasn't just my imagination. I began to actually unravel people, people would mention it. So, financier Jerry, he hadn't seen it a few weeks. I said, Jerry, you probably don't understand how terrible I am. He said, oh, yes, I do, I read the performance reports, I know, I know. So, I should... I am going to leave. He said, I don't want that. If you quit this show, you won't ever act again. First of all, you'd be too afraid to ever act again, and secondly, of course we will get out if you quit this show because you just couldn't handle it, you won't ever act again. So, I can't make you stay, but I want you to be an actor all your life. So I stay... I said, what should I do? He says, you work it out. And so, Peter's whole sensation to being impressed with me when he saw, saw my name in the cast list that the original location was based on sand. Peter spend all his time being intimidated by something that didn't exist and... but also that story moves me, it moves me because of Jerry Robbins. The result of that, that early evening chat one spring in 1962 was that here I'm and here I'm having been to work with all these wonderful people. So, actually I'm thinking everybody. Thank you. [music] This happens, it doesn't ever happened in the program where we dream up that we do this and then the door opens because of that to this and then we got a good review here, so that leads to that, and then you know once singular sensation you know, it hardly ever happens like that and if it does, if all falls apart at some point. Oh, shut up. [music]
