LUCY: You wanted ambition. I hope this is good enough for you. SCOTT: Hello. Judging by that camera you must be Lucy. Lucy: Judging by the camera? How many teenage girls do you get out here? Lucy: With or without a camera? >>Scott: Well, not many. Reception around here is pretty bad. And, well... The way you young people cling to your phones, most of you wouldn't hack it. Lucy: Most of us wouldn't but I'm a little different. Apparently. Why don't you come on in? Scott: You're only the second person I've talked to about this... Hm... in 7 years I guess. [ mysterious music ] The last time was a guy I ran into when I went down to check out the garden myself. Is it hard to talk about? Scott: No, not really. Scott: For folk around here it is. You bring it up and they deny it. Pretend it never happened. Why do you think that is? Well, this place is beautiful. Scott: Farmland as far as the eyes can see. And that's what they want the place to be known for. Not that there was a cult here. You mentioned the garden, I've never been there but I've seen pictures. Lucy: What's the history behind it? Scott: It was built in 1903 by some Colonel. And I guess it's been abandoned about 45 years. And they tore it down about 10 years ago. Prior to them tearing it down the kids would go up there, drinking and partying- and such. But after they tore it down... ...that's when people started reporting strange lights and... Scott:...chanting and stuff. Coming from up there. Hm. >>Scott: I guess that's when the animals started going missing. Farm animals, pets and such. We thought it was coyotes or a bear or something, but - -we really don't have them around here. Then one day we heard the screaming. Scott: Went out there to check it out, took us a good half hour, 45 minutes. By the time we got there everyone was gone. We did, however, find carcasses. Animal remains. Some buried. That's when the police, I think, started taking it seriously and shut it all down. That's fascinating. And this cult was some kind of religious group? Scott: Yeah, 'The Life Movement'. They were up there chanting and doing all kinds of weird stuff. But um... they claimed religious freedom and they had a pretty good lawyer. So I've heard. >>Scott: Yeah, that's true. They wanted to change the world. But I don't see how they were going to accomplish that by drinking animal blood and chanting. Scott: But they believed it enough to do it. And they were trying to give a physical body to some kind of spiritual being? I suppose that's about right. [ Ominous music fades ] [ Car passing, distant traffic ] KRISSY: This is the face I will possibly be making for the rest of my life. All because 'my best friend' is going away and won't be here for my 16th birthday. Krissy: This is the culprit. Krissy: Don't let this beautiful exterior fool you. Krissy: This is the face of pure, unadulterated evil. Krissy: She is ruining the most important week of my life and she doesn't even care. Krissy: She's just sitting there drinking her slushy. Krissy: Yeah, I hope it's good. Sitting there drinking my tears. Krissy: What a b->> MOLLIE: Oh, go somewhere with that! You know I'm going to make it up to you when I get back. I'll be with you all day next Saturday. Take you anywhere you want. While being 6 feet apart of course. Not good enough. >>Mollie: Why not? You only turn 16 once. And I get it, I can't have an actual birthday but it's supposed to be me... ...my mom, my dad, my brother. Oh, and my best friend. But nope. Come on, Krissy. I'll Face Time you on your birthday. What a liar. This beotch is going to be out in the middle of freakin' nowhere as far as we know. But supposedly she's going to have service so she can Face Time me on my birthday. Mollie: Shut up. My aunt said there's reception in some places out there. I'll find one and even if I have to walk 5 miles I'll do it to call you. Krissy: Aww, you don't mean that. >>Mollie: Yes, I do. What if it's 6 miles? Mollie: For your 16th birthday, anything under 6 miles. [ Disapproving groan ] [ Cellphone chime ] Krissy: Who's that? Carmine? I doubt it. Krissy: You noticed that too, right? Mollie: What the heck? He texted me again. Krissy: Oh, hell no. I can't believe this guy. [ Eerie music ] Krissy: Okay. That could just be... Krissy: That's not anything. That's just a coincidence. Mollie: Yup. Coincidence. Time to go. Krissy: Why aren't we running? Because we're smart. We should just play it off like we don't suspect anything. Otherwise, he might chase us. Krissy: Yeah, yeah okay girl. We can do that. We can do that. Don't. >>Krissy: Okay! Krissy: We really should be running. Wait till we hit the corner. Wait till we hit the corner. Wait... okay go! Okay, yeah. I'm on my way home. I know, 'the curfew'. Well, I'm going to drop Krissy back at her house and then... ...her mom's going to drop me off. Okay. Bye. Bye. We'll send the number in but they're always burner phones or - - numbers from apps. It won't mean anything. Well, there's CCTV cameras on streets, right? M-hm. >> We could track him. Yeah, a guy in a hat. Should be easy to identify. They could enhance the footage. Your sisters could do that. Yeah I won't hold my breath. Ready to get out of here? >>I guess. Sorry to cut our night short. >>You didn't. You have an excuse this time. My birthday... >> [ Mollie sucks her teeth ] [ ominous music ] Krissy: We have you on camera. We called the police. Krissy: So... get out of here. Mollie: What do we do? Run for it? Mollie: Should I call the police? Krissy: Um... yeah. Let's call the police. Krissy: While we're walking. I don't want to stick around. Mollie: Sounds good. Let's not do that again. EMELIE: So honestly, if you don't have the money. Or if you just don't feel like spending the money to get your nails done every couple weeks. I'd recommend it. Like I said, I had maybe two little chips after 12 days. And I'm pretty active so that's really good. Usually you're having to do a fresh coat every couple days if you want it to look good. But this will save you time and money so - yeah, buy it. [ Door opens ] You know you're supposed to knock first. What if I was in the middle of something serious? CANDICE: Yeah, right. All you do is gossip and review makeup. When people want the good stuff they wait for me to be on. Uh-huh. Anyway. I was just about to say we're going to be on the road in a couple of days. And where we're going, apparently, the reception is pretty spotty. So, I don't know if we'll be uploading as much as I'd like to. Or at all. Aunt Megan said he had a landline. And he actually uses it. So, what does that mean? Anyone who has a land line has crappy reception. Or they're just a psycho. Well, as you've just heard we're going to be staying with our Aunt Megan for a few days. She has a friend with a place, basically in the middle of nowhere. And he offered it to us. Mom's going to be working long hours at the hospital. And when she's home it's not going to be safe for us to be around. Instead of her sleeping in the car or getting a hotel room - - like some other medical workers are doing. She gets to keep the house. But, it's still a little scary. So please keep her in your prayers. Unfortunately, even if we are able to get videos up, we're going to have to be careful. We don't want strangers knowing exactly where we're going to be. Not that you guys are strangers but... you know what I mean. Internet safety and all. Although there's really just one stranger we're worried about. And speaking of which, Mollie's on her way home. She saw him. >>What? Is she okay? >>Yeah, she's fine. He just texted her about how hot she looked tonight, or something like that. And there was a weird guy across the street on his phone. Jeez, good thing we're leaving. Uh... You've probably caught hints that we've had some crazy stuff going on around here, lately. Some of you have asked and we've avoided talking about it. But Mollie's coming on tomorrow to tell you what's been happening. I know all of my fans out there are into the creepy stuff. But, not only is it real, it's pretty disturbing. So, viewer discretion advised. Okay, so just give a summary of what's been happening. Well, on Valentines Day at school I opened my locker. And there was a cute little sticky note inside. It just said- Show, don't tell. >>What? The sticky. Can I show them? >>Yeah. Mollie: Anyways, I thought it was cute. No one fessed up to it but I had ideas about who it could've been. But it wasn't any of them? No. And a couple days later the next one showed up. And they kept coming. Whoever it was had my locker combination or a key. So we started to think it was a janitor or something. They all checked out. Cameras showed that whoever was doing it, was getting into the school after hours- - when the cameras were off. The notes started getting creepier and creepier. Mollie: We contacted the police. >> [ Eerie, music ] Candice: Do you still have that Voice Mail? HURAM: Amalia, our wait is nearly over. HURAM: Come to me. Let me bathe in you. HURAM: In your blood. Mollie: Some of this is in Aramaic, some is in Greek. Mollie: Some, no one really knows. You are beautiful and all, but this is clearly not just some teenage boy with a crush. Yeah. Were there ever any suspects? What are we on Dateline? Um, well yes. We don't know who my biological Dad was so initially we thought it was him. Until the notes started getting creepy. And Kyle, your Dad, was investigated. But, he's remarried and he has an alibi. So now police think it's someone who just picked me at random. Might've seen me on your show. Might've just followed me home from school. Might just be another student. Um, it might be->>There was a security breach at the doctor's office. They were converting to electronic records when someone broke in and burned the files. They speculated some might've been taken. Yeah, there's that, so... Still unsolved. Creepy as hell. But, police are keeping an eye on the house. I'm never alone when I'm out. So, hopefully they catch him. Or he just gets bored and moves on. [ Piano playing a happy tune ] ♪Winner's Waltz ♪ [ piano keys crash ] [ Both laugh ] You alright? >>I guess. Why are you recording? I'm just doing a test. I was going to ask you to be part of the video. Oh yeah? What do you want me to do? Just an idea I had, for our channel, and for mom. I know you don't play much anymore but she always loved when you did. You're acting like she's dying or something. Why would you say that? Because I don't want you overreacting, and... ...being more anxious than you need to be. You just make things worse for yourself that way. Mom's going to be fine. But some nurses and doctors have gotten sick. She's taking precautions. They were, too, I'm sure but... ...things are getting better. And they will. Yeah. But I still miss her. And it's going to be even worse when we're so far away. I hear ya. I miss her, too. So, you're making a video for her? Yeah, I wanted to put something together. Something special. For her to watch every day. I know it's corny. [ laughs ] Definitely. But good idea. She'll appreciate it. As hard as this is for us, you know it's tougher on her. Being a mom and all. That's true, but - at least she knows we're going to be safe. One less thing for her to worry about then so she can focus on her job, and being careful. Right? >>Right. And we'll have each other for now at least and we'll make the best of it. I'm heading out to see Krissy but when I get back tonight, I'll play something. That work? I might be late but if I am just leave the camera out. I can wait up for you. Nah, it's been a while. I might need some practice. And I don't want you judging me. Who cares what I think, it's for mom. She doesn't care how terrible it sounds, never did before. Shut up. Everything will be fine. Mollie: Love you, squirt. >>You too.

Before the police took it. High note? Really? [ Door opens ] Mollie: What gave you the right to open that box? That was meant for me. You don't just go into my room opening my things. It was from that creeper. What's the difference? You could've gotten hurt. You didn't know what was in there. Are you really worried about me? Or are you made Mom knows you did something with Carmine? You don't know anything about that. Really? How did he touch you, then? That has nothing to do with this. Don't you dare even - Don't go into my room ever again. And don't touch anything that belongs to me or is addressed to me. Fine, I hope you tell Carmine that, too. I will. And you can tell your pervert Dad the same thing. There's a reason he's not around. What did she mean? She's... she's just upset. I told you we shouldn't have opened it.

No, but when I looked around all I saw were VHS tapes. I'm just saying. Oh and her friend, our gracious host, left us this sketchy note. 'Hey Megan, I hope you and the kids have a great time. I'm sorry it isn't more upscale but there's plenty to do. You should be able to get phone reception around the crest a couple miles down the yellow trail. Otherwise, you'll have to be closer town to pick up a signal. Make sure to thoroughly clean all surfaces when you leave. And help yourself to my Purrell and toilet paper. But don't take any home. I will count. Every square.' Got to love that the nearest reception is in the woods two miles away. Just in case anything goes wrong. That's great. Yup. We're on our own pretty much. And we might actually go looking for that crest. There's not much to do around here but we're going to take a little hike. I've got a compass. We're bringing a few supplies including these safety whistles. In case we get lost. But, let's hope that doesn't happen. Time to get Candice. Candice, you really shouldn't stay here alone.

And if anyone does come to the door, don't answer it. If you need anything or you change your mind, just blow that. Okay... Emelie: Are you sure you don't want to come? I'm sure. Maybe tomorrow. It's spooky, huh? Emelie: Yeah. This 100 percent could be in a museum. Oh, I don't look like a dork in this, do I? Emelie: You look totally fine. Don't worry. Emelie: Mollie! Emelie: Mollie, I told you not to go far. [ Ominous music ] Emelie: What the heck is that? Emelie: Be careful. That looks really old. Mollie: You might have to put that down to get in. I can help you. Emelie: Work smarter not harder. Right? Mollie: Whatevs. Emelie: What is this place? Mollie: Looks like an old garden. It had to be part of a mansion or maybe an old college. Something like that. Emelie: What is it doing all the way out here in the middle of nowhere? They might've owned the land and built something out here. Emelie: And then just let it rot away like this? I don't know. Rich people are weird. Maybe they died or just stopped keeping it up. Mollie: What is that? [ Eerie, suspenseful music ] Emelie: Why are you touching that? Emelie: You think it's old? Mollie: As old as this garden I guess, or whatever the heck this was. Emelie: Is that what I think it is? Mollie: Probably. Doesn't mean it's human. Emelie: I don't like it either way. Mollie: I just wanted to see something. [ Branches snapping nearby ] Mollie: Sh. Sh. Mollie: Let's find that hill and get back to the house for now. Emelie: But... >>Mollie: No, be quiet. [ Candice roars, Emelie and Mollie gasp ] Emelie: Candice! [ Mollie laughing ] >>Mollie: Nice one. You have no idea how much work I put into that. But it was so worth it. >>Emelie: You've been following us this whole time? Sure have. If I actually was some kind of creeper, I'd have you guys pretty easy. You are some kind of creeper. Thank you. Oh cool. What is this stuff? We don't know yet. Wasn't there like a cult or something out here like seven years ago? Yeah but they arrested all of them. And this doesn't look that old. Let's hope it is. We better head back, it's getting dark soon. Aunt Megan's calling at eight, remember? Emelie: Yeah. I think the crest is right up there. I'm going to see if I can get any reception. Okay, I'll be right back. >>Emelie: Alright. CARMINE: What are you guys doing up there? Nothing much. Um... oh yeah, my sister found a frog. It's pretty nice, yeah. >>Oh, that's nice. You should kiss it and see if it turns into me. [ Mollie laughs ] You're such a jerk. [ Both laugh ] You know what's crazy? Mollie: What? Carmine: My Dad's cabin. It's like 20 miles from there. Carmine: And he's going to work on it tonight. Mollie: No way. Carmine: I'm serious. He asked me to come. I'm sure it'll be worth the trip. Maybe. We'll be alone out here, so... You know where the crest is? Off the yellow trail, right? Yup. We won't be there until around 11. He wants to work on the cabin bright and early. Meet you here at midnight, then? Carmine: I'll be there. See you in a bit. >>Mollie: Bye. You going to lecture me again? I hear it enough from Aunt Megan. If you won't listen to her, you won't listen to me either. So what's the point? But if you got angry at Candice for putting your business out there, Emelie: Maybe you shouldn't be doing it. She's still hurt. I didn't say anything that wasn't true. That doesn't matter. True or not, you said it to hurt her feelings. And you did. Can you imagine finding that out about your own Dad? It'd be nice to have a Dad to be disappointed in. I know you don't mean that. I'll talk to her tomorrow. In the morning. After things have cooled down, okay? Are you really coming out here at midnight? By yourself? Yeah, I'll be fine. Don't worry about it. And don't mention it. As long as no one asks. I'm not lying for you. I wouldn't ask you to. Emelie: What are you doing over there? Um... just playing games. [ Cicadas in background ] [ Face Time ringing tone ] Hey, why are you Face Timing me instead of hanging out with Carmine? He's late, just thought I'd check in. Mm. Boys. But don't think this gets you off the hook for my birthday call. I know! >>Good. Are you alone? >>Duh, I couldn't bring my sisters with me. I'm crazy, but I would not have just... ...gone out into the woods by myself. I won't be by myself for long. And besides, I came prepared. [ Rustling in bag ] I got this. >>Hm. And... this. Krissy: Nice, our old home school friend taught you well, didn't she? Yep. All those nights camping and playing manhunt had to count for something, right? [ Krissy laughing ] Hey, that's Carmine. I'll message you before I leave, okay? You better. Love you. >>You too. Carmine: Hey Mollie, it's the frog you're going to give a big smooch tonight. [ Carmine makes a kissing sound, then laughs ] I've been walking out here for hours. I hope my Dad doesn't kick my butt tonight. Jeez. He's really going to be mad. But you know, it's for you, though. Carmine: Ugh. This is the right direction, right? Yeah. I hope your sisters don't catch us tonight. [ Eerie, suspenseful music ] Carmine: What the... [ bloody knife cutting sound ] Emelie: Mollie, what's wrong? [ Branches breaking ] What the heck is that? What are you doing here? I woke up and went to go check on Candice and she was gone. I thought maybe she came with you. She wasn't in her room? She wasn't in the house. She took my camera and she left. You should call the police. Something happened to my phone. It won't turn on. Did you bring yours? No, I fell asleep listening to something. But it's on the charger. Let's get back to the house. What about Candice? We'll find her, come on! [ Intense music ] [ Mollie gasps ] Mollie: Get behind me, Em. [ Emelie gasps ] Mollie: Come on, let's go. Mollie: Keep running, Em. Come on. Emelie: Is he behind us? Mollie: I don't know, let's go. Mollie: Get behind the tree. Get down. Get down. Cut the light. [ Suspenseful music ] Emelie: He's going to find us. He's going to find us here. Stop it, I'll protect you. [ Movement in the leaves ] [ Footsteps in leaves moving away ] Okay. Okay. [ Catching breath ] We don't want to follow right behind him, he might um... ...he might retrace his steps, you know? We have to find Candice. Yeah. I think I can get us back there. If we move a hundred yards this way. And, we keep moving forward. We'll get back. We'll probably find her on the driveway. I think he's dead. I think... Carmine's dead. Mollie: [ crying ] I think he's dead. Emelie: Well, Candice isn't. [ Mollie crying ] Emelie: We have to look for her and get out of here, okay? [ Mollie sobbing ] Emelie: It's not your fault, don't worry. [ Sticks rubbing together ] Come on, stupid. Come on! D-mn sticks, you know... It's been a rainy day. I'll edit that later. Sticks would've been so much cooler. But maybe... By the time it actually worked my battery died. Because it took so long. That would explain the edit. Yeah. Sounds about right. That... is satisfying. I'm going to lay down soon and try to go to sleep. I'll probably start heading home when the sun comes up. Aunt Megan won't be home until 7:30. So, chances are good I won't get into trouble. We'll see. I feel better out here. I've been holding it together the whole day. I'm not okay. I didn't think Dad was the best dad in the world or anything. But... I wasn't expecting that. At all. I just wish someone would have told me sooner. Even Mollie. Just not the way she did. She... She was a freakin beotch about it. I can edit that out later. My mom does not like that kind of language at all. But... I do understand why no one told me. In part, I wouldn't even have minded not knowing. But, if I never found out. It would've been like living a lie, you know? Every time I went to go see him for Christmas... ...or every time he called, which... ...was probably like three times a year. But still. I don't know. I just wanted some time and some space... ...so it would be quiet so I could really think. I'm getting kind of tired so I'll probably start rambling soon. I'm going to eat these yummy marshmallows. And turn in for the night. I've got to go to the bathroom. I'm taking you with me in case it's an adventure. I don't want to go too close to my site. So... here goes nothing. And... just to let you know. I've got some backup. That did not go well. I guess I'm changing back into my real clothes. I... [ leaves rustling ] I thought I heard something. Or felt something. Maybe the woods around here are haunted. The cult left that stuff. There could still be spirits, you know? I swear it feels like something's over there. Maybe I just need to get back to sleep. Yeah. [ loud rustling in the leaves ] [ Footsteps approaching ] [ Branch falls near camera ] [ Gunshot ] [ Ominous music ] [ Gunshot ] ETHAN: Come on out, you little witch. That fire's just started. I know you're close. I don't know what you're up to tonight. But it's not going to happen. Not tonight. [ Gunshot ] You hear me? Now, if you bring your little self out I might just let you live. But if I have to come get you... Not only are you going to die. But I'll have to shoot you in that little leg of yours. Watch you bleed out. I've seen it before. Believe me... ...not the way to go. But you already knew that. [ Suspenseful music continues ] [ Footsteps fade away ] Quiet. Stay quiet, okay? If he hears - if he hears us, we could both be dead. Okay? Stay quiet and come on. I need my camera. It's important. Fine. Okay. Get your camera. Stay behind me. Okay? Okay. Where are we going? My - my house is back that way. There's a phone. We could call the police. You're staying at the vacation house? >>Yeah. Yeah, it's no good. I saw somebody back there. What about my sisters? I didn't see any girls over there. But I did see a guy. He was going through your stuff. I saw him through the window. Okay just... keep up. Stay quiet. I don't know where he is. We'll talk later, okay? Come on. Alright. Mollie: I think it's safe. I haven't seen anything, have you? No, but that doesn't mean he isn't in there. I'll watch the house. You keep your eyes on the woods. And watch our six. Emelie: What? Behind us, sorry. [ Menacing, suspenseful music ] Mollie: The phone's right over there. You go call, I'll check the rooms. Why? Because if Candice came back she could be in trouble. Okay? I don't want to take any chances. Are you sure? Mollie: I can't let anything happen to her. Mollie: Okay? Just go ahead and be quiet. Emelie: Everything okay in there? Yeah. [ Muffled noise ] Mollie, what the- Mollie: Don't come in here. Mollie: What the hell? [ Frightened breathing ] [ Menacing, suspenseful music ] Emelie: What is it? Did you call for help? No, the phones weren't working. He must've cut the line outside. I think he has her. He left a note and he wants me to go follow a path to find them or... ...something bad will happen. Can I see the->>Mollie: No, no, no. Let's just go. Emelie: I know you went shooting with Aunt Megan, but... Emelie:...is that where you learned how to do all this? Mollie: No. Remember my homeschooled friend before she moved? So her mom was in the army and she taught her how to handle herself and then some. And we played manhunt so she taught me some things. Emelie: Thank God. >>Yeah. We should get moving soon. Candice: So, who was that guy? Probably a cult leader. The cops think they caught all the cult members but you never know for sure. Candice: Why is he after me? Wrong place, wrong time. Not to mention... You took that knife from the garden, didn't you? Yeah. >> [ Scoffs ] Don't you know you're not supposed to take things that don't belong to you? Even if the cult doesn't use that anymore. Candice: How was I supposed to know anyone was out there? Candice: It didn't look new. Candice: And... why are you out here? My brother and I are from Kingswood. It's on the other side of the woods. We're urban explorers. So, you know... ...we explore abandoned buildings. Um, this warehouse, stuff like that. I was hiking in the woods behind the warehouse, when this guy came out of nowhere and started shooting at me. So, I ran away and I found myself here. Candice: And your brother? I don't know. I hope he's okay. Maybe he went back and he called for help. Whatever. The point is, we have to get back to the warehouse. Okay? That's the last place I saw my brother. And if he called for help, that's where help will be. Candice: What's wrong? Shh. Alright, I'm going to go ahead. Okay? I'll be back soon. I'm just going to go ahead of you, make sure there's no crazy people out there. Okay? Candice: Why can't I go with you? Isn't it safer if we're together? Have you ever outrun the cops? Candice: What? No! I have. Okay? It's part of being an urban explorer. You have to be quick on your feet. You have to know how to move, okay? Just trust me. I'll be back and... ...give me 10 minutes, tops. Okay? Okay. Candice: Be careful. [ Haunting, suspenseful music ] We came out here to get away from the craziness, and now... Well, Mom, this video isn't going to be what I planned. But, since you like scary movies... I guess it'll work for something. [ Branches snapping, footsteps ] Do you hear that? [ Footsteps ] [ loud inhuman roar ] >>Candice: No. [ Scared breathing ] Huram: Candice. Are you frightened? Huram: Blood. Huram: Tastes so much sweeter. When you're scared. [ Sounds of a brief struggle ] [ Footsteps ] [ Gunshot ] Huram: Ethan. Huram: What have I to do with you? You're asking me that while my sisters sits - - in a mental institution because of all the stuff you sold her on? Huram: Your sister made her own choices. Huram: I never forced anyone to join my cause. You manipulated them. Her. If we hadn't gone through what we went through before you came- - do you think she would've bought all you were selling her? Huram: Regardless. Huram: She made her decision. Huram: And just as I promised her. Huram: She will be rewarded. Not if I put a bullet through your head right now and end this. You might've convinced her you were something special. But I could end this right now. [ Huram laughs ] Huram: And then what? Huram: She'll just go free? Huram: You really believe they'll allow her to walk? Huram: After all the terrible things she's done? What's with the kid? I thought she was with you, I almost killed her! Huram: Now that would've been... Huram: ...unfortunate. Huram: For you. Huram: The girl is serving a higher purpose. Huram: One you would do well not to interfere with. Huram: I'm going to allow you one opportunity. Huram: To lower your gun and walk away. Huram: For Mina's sake. [ Gunshot ] You don't say her name! Kid. Get out of here, now! You don't have to see this. Go! [ Intense music ] [ Gunshot ] [ Gunshot ] [ Huram snarls ] Candice: What was that? Candice: What the hell was that? What the hell was that? Candice: I need to get out of here. Candice: Where am I? I don't even know where to go. [ Intense music fades out ] I have no idea what I just saw. But, when I was going up a hill. I saw buildings. And... I really want to see if I can find help. Or something that I can use to help me. But... We'll have to see. [ Footsteps on gravel ] What the heck? [ Door rattling, footsteps ] Hey, what happened? I heard gunshots. Are you okay? I was coming back to find you. I'm fine. Is your brother here? No. He must've gotten away, already. He probably called the cops. That guy with the gun's still out there isn't he? Which way is your house? It's a couple miles back. Although we should probably stay here. I don't want to get lost and... it's dangerous. Get lost? You don't know the way back to your own house? When we came out here the sun was going down. We were just having fun, you know? Gotcha. Did you see him? Yeah, um. He shot at me again but I got away. I think he's hurt or something. I'm pretty sure he saw which way I was headed. We should probably go. Which way did you come in? Over there. Okay. Just stick with me. We'll lock the door. Everything will be fine. Okay. Right behind you. [ Cutting sound, Lucy groaning ] [ Lucy and Candice groaning in pain ] Lucy: Get back here. You stupid brat! Lucy: You're just making this worse for yourself. Who are you filming for? Youtube or Mommy? Why stop shooting now? I'm sure she'd love to see her precious little daughter's... ...final moments. Lucy: He said I was supposed to lead you to the warehouse. Lucy: I was supposed to bring you alive but, Lucy: Either way your sisters will come, and... Lucy: I guess it doesn't really matter anyway. Lucy: But after what you just did. Lucy: And if it's up to me, which it is right now. Lucy: It's not looking good for you. Lucy: Unless, you come out now. Lucy: You've lost a lot of blood. I could help you. Even if you don't want my help. You won't get far. Because I'll hunt you down. And I'll slit that pretty little throat of yours. There's much worse that I could do. You thought Ethan was bad? Last chance! Show yourself. Okay. [ Lucy grunts ] [ Lucy groans ] [ Blood splatters ] [ Candice breathing heavily ] [ Intense, foreboding music ] Mollie: Turn your light off. Emelie: Why? We might be close. I don't want to just walk into a trap. Come on, let's move off a little bit. Candice: I found this phone. I think it's Lucy's. Of course there's no signal. What's this? Lucy: You wanted ambition. Lucy: I hope this is good enough for you. Yeah, I'm not in hiking shape anymore. Hip surgery and all. Sorry to make you go up there on your own. Lucy: It's okay. I came prepared. Lucy: And, you know. If I don't came back before sunrise, call somebody I guess. Yeah. Somebody. Lucy: Ow. Scott: I'll get that. What's this? You know Mollie? Lucy: Yeah. Mollie Wilkos. Lucy: How do you know her? I know her aunt. Haven't seen the girls in a few years. She hasn't changed much. Hm. Scott: What is this stuff, anyway? [ Stabbing sound, Scott grunts ] Scott: What'd you do? Lucy: Stay down! >> [ Scott grunts ] [ Lucy screaming, Scott choking, stabbing sounds ] [ Unsettling music ] Scott Maddow. You heard what he said. He knew Megan. Mollie's aunt. And... he's had this place... Listed on Airbnb for a while. Why wouldn't he offer it to them? Through all the... chaos and everything going on. And the virus. I hope this... Can convince you. That I'm ready. And I can be useful to you. [ Unsettling music fades out ] [ Groaning in pain ] [ Groaning in pain ] [ Footsteps and deep grunting ] [ Suspenseful music ] [ Tearing and ripping sounds ] [ Grunting ] [ Pained growl, bullet clatters to the ground ] [ Candice gagging quietly ] I'm going to go in alone. [ Deep, mournful music ] That way if anything goes bad... You'll have the chance to run for it. I'm not just going to leave you. Or Candice. We're in this together. I'm not giving you a choice, Emelie. If something bad happens to me. Or if something already happened to Candice. I need you to get home to Mom. Okay? I love you. Take this. Just in case. [ Unsettling industrial music ] [ Animal chirping ] [ Page rustling ] [ Metallic scraping sound ] [ Eerie, suspenseful music ] [ Muffled gasp ] You made it. Mollie: Where is Candice? She's safe. And she'll remain safe. As long as you do all that I ask. Mollie: You were watching me? Mollie: Sending me those things? This whole time? Yes. Mollie: So why take Candice? I keep my physical body alive through blood. But I have my limitations. Every so often I require human cooperation. Willing offerings. In the past I've used cults to serve my purposes. This time. I tried something different. Something... More fun. Mollie: Screw you. [ Huram chuckles ] Mollie: You want... my blood? Oh yes. Every ounce. Over time. It will be extremely painful. But Emelie and Candice will survive. And more importantly. You will live on. In my veins. A part of me forever. Now. Kneel. Slow. [ Ethan gasps ] [ Intense music ] Ethan: Behind you. My love. [ Gunshots ] [ Demonic growl ] [ Scared breathing ] [ Mollie breathing heavily ] [ Demonic growl, Mollie grunts ] [ Gunshots ] [ Gun clicks ] [ Mollie grunts ] [ Demonic growl ] [ Bullet chambered, gunshot ] Candice, are you ready? >>Almost. [ Gunshot ] >>Come on, they're coming. [ Intense energetic music ] Emelie: Come on, Mollie, run! Emelie: Get behind me, Mollie. [ Huram snarling, Emelie screams ] [ Deep stabbing noise I [ inhuman bellowing ] [ Smoke going off ] [ Quiet, suspenseful music building ] [ Huram growls ] [ Huram exhales heavily ] [ Suspenseful music ] What the hell was that? It doesn't matter, let's go. I found this. Think there's a signal? Should be. There's got to be a road nearby. Let's go. Mollie: Keep the gun with you. Just in case. [ Suspenseful music fades out ] I'm sorry. For what, telling the truth? No, for telling it like a jerk. And... he is your Dad. You're my sister. And you didn't do anything wrong. He did. Honestly, I'm more mad no one else said anything. And all this time I talked to you about him. And I had no idea what he did. I'm sorry. You have nothing to apologize for. It's terrible what he did to you. [ haunting, emotional music ] Hey, we got through tonight. All of us did. Together. So we can do anything. Can't we? Yeah. [ Footsteps in leaves ] [ Haunting, somber music ] Do you need me to tighten it? Candice: Yeah.
