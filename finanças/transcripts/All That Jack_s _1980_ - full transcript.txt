Do you know how they call you? -No but I'm curious. "Whiskey", they call you Djoka Whiskey. Think about that when you sobber up. She's here! Colleague Whiskey, I'm afraid that your courtship is totally wrong. Stupidity, they don't call the school workers "Whiskey". Sour wallow, brandy that's for us. Don't...

Have a seat, please. -Thank you. She wrote delation... And now what? What did Miloje said? -That I should investigate. Thanks, Dam. Call Bogdan. Pardon... Ulcer is aching me when the weather is like this. You must know that the deputy is one honest man, educator for many years, employee with big experience... And whole thing smells on something dirty and dishonest... You know what, I only have a delation by English teacher about misusing of official place. And I have to investigate is that true or is it not. I don't know of nothing else, sorry. Dam, come here afterwards, I have to tell you something. It will be mess.... It will be mess... You know this is Dam's last paycheck? And how's that? She's retiring tomorrow. We have forgotten about that. Yes... Miloje sent this young man. Ahh, Miloje... -How is Miloje? -He's alright, alright... Alright? He's tough... Miloje, he's tough... I remember we were... on some meeting. Was that in... in Arandjelovac... Or... Okay, that's not important now... No, that was on Zlatibor... Yes, on Zlatibor. What he was doing, that was incredible, he entertained people so much... And he sings so nicely... ahh... in general, he is very interesting man. Very, very interesting... Be kind and tell us about your relation with English teacher. What? What... my..? You relations with English teacher, Gordana Lukic? What can you tell me about that? -What... I don't have any relations... with her... Get me Kole on the phone, I'll be right back. Comrade director, I have a problem with Dam. I can't do all by myself. Dam, you know someone who would work? -What? What you're doing. -I don't. -Wait a moment, please. Go and call director, Kole is on the line. Come on. Kole is on the line! -She's in there? Yes. Hello, hello... He hung up. -Hang up!? Call him again! Dam is retiring tomorrow. Who will work instead of her? You remebmered that now, you're such a bunch! Hire another worker! We can't do that without contest and we can't pay part-time workers. Manage yourself, use your head! -How, when my hands are tied? Don't yell you old fart or this will be your last yelling. Hello! On 26th of April,1980., he intercepted me on a hallway and told me straight that he will use all availble, available recources, his authority to, if I don't agree to be his lover, destroy me. He was able to blackmail me 'cause there was no one around who could be a witness. Frightened by this threats, especially by words: "You'll be thrown out like old rag", I could only to agree to that. What is it? You should receive our demand for some carpet. Yes. See, Kole. I'm sure that someone would try to tranfer our sinking-fund... Yes. Come on, we don't have that sum, we're school, you know how much is big our area? Who could presume that carpets will start to tear apart after only one month? Tell me, what are you doing tonight? We have a small celebration... Collation. -Dam, water! It would be nice of you to come, eh? Our... I'm sorry... Our worker is retiring, yes. -Dam! Dam! It's just farewell dinner. Bring Cuca, Kole. She has fashion night? Okay, then you come alone. Bye. So long. Whinny, did I tell you not to yell? You see I'm talking!? -Bogdan is sick! What? We need to unbutton his shirt. -Take it easy... Wait... -Air! Pour water over him! -No, not him! Bogdan! He's holding something... Under the tongue! -What? Put the pill under his tongue. I can't... his fingers cramped... I can't give a cent without authorization of the board! Vuksan, for the last time I'm telling you to lower your voice. -I'm talking that way! Then assemble the board in time of pause between clases! If we could make a celebration to every raf that set foot here and give them golden watches, then we can give some joy to the woman who spent half of her life cleaning our shit, is that right!? I don't mind! -You don't, eh? You would abridge your own mother, Vuksan! What is it? -I came to ask you what about paychecks, Smilja is on sick-leave. Big fuss, to give envelops. Is your hand going to fall of if you replace sick colleague? And you? -I have to dry up. I didn't want to make this decision by myself, so that later wouldn't be talking around the school and out of school that I'm deciding all alone here, and that I want to make my memorial stone out of this school. I can't believe that. -There are talks and they're coming from the well known source. - Very well, anyone have anything to ad? No one? Wait, wait. We need to vote for this. We're all for, let's go to take paychecks. -You're some home-ruler, Djorjde. Who is for the proposition that tonight we make a small celebration due to retiring of our long standing worker Tankosava Djukic - Dam, and on this occasion to deliever her a gift in the name of our organization? Against - no one, repressed - no, put in protocol - voted for, unanimously. Djordje, come here, please. Vuksan, you should ask Dam, what does she need so we wouldn't buy something she would throw away. Very well. And what sum we're talking about? -Well, about 700000 - 800000. Excuse me? From where? From where!? And we can throw money around for some stupid celebrations? For footballers, for mathematic Olimpiad... And when we have to help the poor we're tight up? FC RED STAR payed footballers... -Shut up, please! Shame on you! And you two, prepare something short but sweet. -For tonight? No, for the next year! You have something old, just adjust to be suitable for Dam! Last was for that footballers... -Adjust that, invent something! You're sluging all day anyhow! Carpet is gone... Your names, please. -Excuse me? What? Your names and your working places. Will you tell me your name? Say -Stojanovic Dobrila, server. -Stojanovic, right? -Dobrila, yes. You? -I am Ljiljana Grbic, also, likewise, server. Under Article 316 of statue of education let me take your statements. What statements? -What? It's about forcing an English teacher on... on... on love... intimate relation. -We don't know anything. -Don't have a clue. You probably heard something? Somebody told you something. We haven't heard anything, it's beter you ask him. -Ljilja... I haven't told anything... -Comrade Stojanovic, please don't... If he could, he would... -Ljilja! -Excuse me? I say that he would all of us, well it's not... nevermind. Wait, what did you say, I can't hear you? We don't know anything... We're just doing our job, we don't know what's going on. Alright, thank you. Let me go, Jesus. Excuse me, where can I find Gordana Lukic, English teacher? -I don't know. Look at the cabinet. -Where, on the upper floor? -I don't know anything. Take a seat. Colleague, please, be kind and step out for the moment. Me? -Yes, you. Sanja! You wrote this? Very well. Now you'll tell me... how did misusing of the official placement by the deputy took place. You'll tell me everything that could... -I don't wanna talk about it. Specially not here. Looks like I wasn't clear enough, look, comrade deputy denies your relation. That doesnt' interests me. All I had to say I wrote there. Don't disturb me anymore, please. Wait, only with your cooperation we can to... Physical effort you're putting up now is investment for all that awaits you in future life. 14, 15... When it comes to temptation, 16, you'll be able to stand tall, 17, and be ready for every strike, 18, like real males, 19, and not like some grannies, 19 and a half, and to strike back if needed, 19 and three of a quarter, like real men, 20. Okay, stand up. Stand up, relax, that's right, breath. Breath deeply! I don't wanna see that someone's not breathing. And now, riding! Oh, come on! -Be quiet there! I haven't ask for a laywer. Come on, begin. Riding! Start! Come one, get ready! To the basket and back for 25 seconds. Who failes goes again. Understood? Good afternoon, Simic. -Good afternoon. Under Article 325 of statue of education that sets down the obligation to educational organizations that they must report all info and data to officials who control rightness of their work... Please, be kind and tell me everything you know or you might notice about intimate relations between your colleagues. Sorry, I don't know what you're talking about. I can't in front of the kids. Light down, remount, change positions! Have you noticed that, for example between English teacher and some of someone of your colleauge there's something going on? Who? Don't be literal, I didn't meant her directly, it hasn't to be her. Young man, I think that you're on a wrong adress. I'm not a rat. -I didn't told that. Arrest me, do what you want but you won't hear anything from me against my colleagues. I'm not like that atrophied babbler to talk around behind someone's back. Who? -Who else? Biology teacher. Teacher, can we drink some water? You can't! Children, I always tell that everything you learn you must confirm in practice. Now I will give you one example. Last winter, my daughter and I travel with package tour in Rome. And we were visiting those ruins, suddenly she stubmle and fell from 4 meters high, broke her arm. And then, you can imagine... Ambulance, hospital, her arm in gyps, me totally freaked out. And they wanna to keep her in, to check her head to see if anything's wrong. I'm getting crazy... The plane is flying in the afternoon. No, they wanna keep her in just to see if anything's... I didn't buy sandals, nothing. Okay. We somehow manage to get out, got going, we arrived in Belgrade, but there - customs... They doubt that arm is broken and they suspect that we're smuggling something. It took us 2 hours to get straight with them. All others form our group went home already. I don't know, Miloje... I Don't know. He was here an hour ago... Yes. What, he didn't get back yet? Listen, what are you doing tonight? He have some small celebration and it would be nice of you to come by. What? When you can. We'll have some show and then we'll sit down. Only our peple we'll be here. Come on. I would be pleased if you come. Come. Bye, Miloje! What? -Dam doesn't want anything. -How's that? -She doesn't want. Stop babbling, you're not able to find out what that woman needs. You can't do anything without me, if I wasn't here you would die hungry!? It doesn't pay off to buy something big when she lives with her son and daughter in law in just one room. Dam have a son? I didn't have a clue. We should find out where he's working. I don't have a clue, really don't know... Listen, make a decision about a color for the carpets. Find out! That woman has one and only child in this world, and we will not invite him!? What would it like?! And what about snack? That should be real nice. Kole is coming and maybe even Miloje. I don't know how, when we unanimously decided to abate fund for presentations? I don't know, honey. Think of something. It's not your money. I can't. I can't, how can I? Out! I hate people who're always saying "I can't". Get out! What's with that young man? I don't know, I haven't seen him. -Do you know anything?! You goat! -Say, Kole and Miloje will come here at the same time? -Yes, so what? I forgot that they are not talking. That they're in conflict. I am such a idiot! Out! What was it like? You were bored? -No, not at all. Can we continue? -Of course. Can I talk straight? -Please do, I'm glad to help. I'm interested in relations between the staff. More precisely, male-female. Can that be found here? Of course. I'm an example. How do you mean that? -You haven't heard about me? No, what? -Me and my husband. He's teaching technics. No, not that. I meant... -You must meet him. Wonderful man. Wonderful. Gladly... -You know what, when you meet him, then you realize what man can do with his life. Let's go to cabinet to surprise him. Let's go! I would not... -No, no, let's go. He was carpenter when we met, just an ordinary worker. I got pregnant and we decide to get married. From that moment he started to work on himself. He finished pedagogy. He was the oldest in the class bu he wasn't embaressed by that. He started to work, learn, educate. Always with the book in his hands. Not that he became like me, he got ahead of me. Hello, Gordana... Director ordered that nobody but me and her can use this restoom... Cause of the keys. She said it must be locked. You can wash your hands, I'll wait. Gordana, please, I must ask you something. Move so I can go. Today he outsmarts me always. You'll see, that brightness and inteligence, you'll see. Work, children... work. You just work... Sava? This is young colleague, comrade, he came to find out about relations here. Simic. He was in my class and now I brought him here to see what you're doing here. What we're doing? We're working... You see, what ever I say, he outsmarts me. Wonder man. We're slicing, scraping, glueing, nailing, that's what we're doing. Alright, that's nice. What's this, is it a library? This? Are you nuts? What library? Shelf for pickled food for the kitchen. Stop talking nonsense. -Alright, Sava, I didn't know. You see, you can't tell him anything. I told him about you life path, how you became teacher, how you progressed. -I made myself really happy... I could earn money as carpenter to buy a Volvo instead I'm jerking here with kids. -Alright, don't in front of him... Why not?! Alright. Character! What's this? It that glueing? -It's not dry yet. What's not dry!? Again! Slice that bearings and put some iron truss. Understood? Or somebody will break his neck. Children are waiting. I must go to the class. Come on. You're alone? -Yes. Dam, I fucked up director's limo. Some fool came out of nowhere and bang in the forefront. Splashboard is destroyed... And bumper, bumper is like this... I towed it to here, two streets away. If she would see it, she would have a heartattack. Thanks. Dam makes coffe for us for some small money. Let me be straight... Totally, please. About love relationships, this is impossible area for that. These people, this area... Primitivism, they must notice even when a fly flew over. The most important is, who is with who, who saw who, who heard who... Village, envy, malice... -And what's the cause for such talking? Well... You know, our school is still buorgeoisly designed... Yes? -Here, bourgeois standards are doubled, and every need for freedom is being judged as a moral crime. Wait, I asked you straight and I need a straight answer. Well... you must know that... bans are speacially aplied to the teachers. You know, over each of us floats a threat of a mistake, that will help us to step into a forbidden area... And what is love? Love - that's freedom, it doesnt' stand up bans, it destroys taboos, it's defiant! Please, can you tell me straight? Who they are backbiting the most and why? You mean right here? -Yes. -Here? -Yes. Me. You know how do they call me? Emmanuelle. And why? -Cause I'm making mistakes, cause I'm not like them, cause I'm an artist and not frustrated coward. All of that makes them to doubt, and doubt is enough to give absurd nickname like this one: me, Emmanuelle! Where you're going? -Home. What do you mean? And what you'll wear for celebration? You can't like that... Open up! Vuksan, come! Come. Look... She can't go like this. Look what she looks like! Why, she's good. -Come on, look at her hair. And her clothes. It is a little bit... Is that why you called me? -Yes -Come on... Old rags. Do you have something nice to wear? -I don't. What are you doing here? What's that on your head? Nothing... I bumped my head. -Jesus... First, we need to find some nice clothes. Second, we have to fix with hair. Wait here and don't move. You hear me? Sit here. Perfect! Eh? -What do you say? -Where did you get it? -In a department store. See, I bought her a make-up. -What a nice make-up... That's not going to be a Dam, it will be Miss Universe. Shut up, Djordje. See this... -And what are you going to wear? Somebody saw Stole? We haven't comrade director! -Where's that fool? If I see him, I'll tell him that you were looking for him. You look desperate, collegaue. You have worries? You now, maybe you have to write that down, you're good at it? Get off, you drunk idiot! Expressions, expressions... Kristina, come right away! I'm going, Savica. Djordje, listen... We have to prepare that show. Go and work, what is it? Go and start. I don't know. At the meeting no one mentioned dresses or cosmetics. What's this? Jewellery? Costume jewellery, see, 14 000. Sorry. We can't... Where is that fool? -I don't know.Listen, about this? Goodbye 'till tonight, comrade director. How to justife that expenses? I can't. I don't know, director approved. And where were you? Comrade Miloje asked for you couple of times. Me? And why? I don't know. Director spoke with him. You're still here? -I am. I'll stay 'tiil I finish the case. Why did you left the car there when they can't fix them today? What do I know, he said like that. -What do you use that head for? I must be in 200 places, and after that I have to go home and get dressed. I told you to take my car. Here. -Which one? Here you are. -This one? -That one... Let me. -Where is the first gear? Right after the second. See, you have to close like this. Did I bump it? - No, it's nothing. How nothing when I bumped it? -It's nothing, just drive. Nevermind. Good afternoon. -Good afternoon. Can I help you? -You're taking a stroll? Yes, and why do you ask? I mean... You don't have some errands. You're not busy. No, no. And why is that, you have something to say to me? I have, just I don't know... -No, no, speak freely. I'm available. No problem. I have some car behind the corner. I need to get them here... So, if you're not busy, you would like to help me? We're done in 5 minutes. Come on, please. 5 minutes. And how are you? -Fine, fine... Here they are. -Is it far? -No... Little bit here. Good. And now make-up! Dunja, don't put that on me. -Be quiet, I didn't ask you anything. Close your eyes. You used to look like scarecrows. You're working your ass off, in school, around the house. Right? You don't think on yourself. What was the last time you looked yourself in the mirror, eh? Dunja, what's that tonight? Be quiet while I'm putting lipstick on you. Open your mouth, like this... Now like this... Hurry, hurry. You want some coffe? We made some for us and there's one left but with sugar. You're very kind, thank you. You wanna cigarette? -No, thanks, I don't smoke. Not even with the coffee!? OK, for later. Thanks. I can't drink coffee without a cigarette, I'd rather die. It's wonderful here, like this is no school, it's very nice. -Very nice... If it's that nice you wouldn't be snooping around. Like we're some kind... -Have you finished your job? I did, I did... And what Goca said? -All. She said all? -What? What did she say? -Tell us, please. -She wouldn't but he forced her. Come on! How can someone force you if you don't want to? -It's possible! Stop with nonsense... -He didn't forced me, he lured me... Stop that nonsense, Ljiljo! How it can be if you don't want to? It can be! And who knows what he done to poor Goca!? To Goca? What are you talking about when we all saw her when she sneaked around? Oh come on, what are you talking about... Sneaking so nobody could see her... She's not sneaking, she walking that way. -Come on, she was sneaking to the gym... I would like to see you, what would you do if he lured you in to the gym. That's what I would like, to go to him. -And how do you know I haven't been? You were? -I was. -Liar. She's such a liar! I'm not lying I was up there in the gym. Really, I was. -Did he climb, or not? You just tell me that. You mean on those ladders? -No, just say did he climb or did he not? He was climbing, fucking hell... He climbed and he howled like this: Yes, yes! And he was saying: "I am Tarzan, I am Tarzan!" I know about that gym, I know.That must be his main place, right!? We don't have a clue. -We don't know anything. GYM If you will be naughty and continue to spy on us, our choir will sing you the whole repertory. I'm looking for a comrade deputy, he wasn't here? No. Emmanuelle told me that you're asking about love life in our temple of wisdom. We were talking a little bit... And you know about delation? Yes, yes, I do. It's good you came. You see our small poet-musical- ballet piece called "Ode to Dam"? Cira arranged all that by himself and I assisted a little bit. Cira, comrade would like, in the name of the officials that he represents, to see your work. Children! Kid, bring that chair. -No, thank you, I don't have time. Here you are, a chair. Have a seat. I have to go! -No, no, not at all! You'll be our first audience and check temathic rightness of the whole conception. I'll join you. We haven't practice that much, deadline was really short. Comrade official understands, you just start. Shall we? -Yes, yes... 3, 4... This is sorrow prelude. Nothing actual, sorrow as it is. We had that for Women's Day, only with words. "Hygienic optimism" Sorrow was beacuse of insanitary. This scene was taken from the show for the footballers, just that, foot movement, that symbolized victorius scoring, is replaced by sweeping movements. Nice and practical. "Dam" All these years we have called you simply, Dam. This is my humble tribute from the literary section. And you're head of literary section? -Yes, yes. Most ouf us doesn't know your name but deep inside feel your care for our health, so we can work and live in clean space, that our classrooms and hallways we're running through, shine like a surface of the lake shined by the moonlight... Original work, speacially written for this occasion. Without you our childhood wouldn't be happy, danger of disease would be over our heads, we wouldn't be able to look through the clean windows at the first spring birds. Nobody helped her. She did it herself. Thank you Dam, for every dawn that you spent cleaning. Thank you for every blister on your hands, thank you for understanding mischiefs of our youth. Thank you, Dam. Stop, stop, stop, stop! You don't like it? -No, no, no. It's nice, I like it. You don't have a regulation about technical-hyigenic protection? We're not in obligation to have it. You will not gain anything by doing that, I'll not talk. You're only wasting your time. I'm not wasting my time! I'll not go 'till we clear all of this! Alright, stay then! It's true! it's true that, Gordana and I love each other for 5 years now. We wanted to get divorced but we were afraid of the scandal. She's married? -Yes. I have two kids, she doesn't have children. And your wife? -My wife knows. And I don't know about her husband. Comrade Lukic is claiming that you misused your placement to force her on that. But man, everybody knows that we're in love, you can ask any of the pupils... I asked all your colleagues, nobody wants to talk, all are silent. No... no... she did that from revenge. And why? -Cause I left her. And she still loves me, she's desperate, that's why. Slowly. She loves you? -She does. You love her? - I love her, lover her... like God. Wait, why did you left her if you're love her? Everbody's in love, you love her she loves you, and you left her? Why? Because I... find out... -What? I caught her... -Where did you caught her? Let me do it. Let go! Deputy, let go. I'll do it! Let go your hand! Deputy, let go your hand! It's, alright. -Sava, please don't... I don't wanna tell you 6 times. -We agreed, take it easy, you have time or you'll mess up. Good evening, Stole, you're coming too? Hello, Stole! What's that? -I bumped my head a little bit. Nobody's asking you about that. That in your hand. -Part for Fiat. Fiat? That's for Volvo at least! Okay, Sava, we're late. Late!? They cheated him, they wanna take his money, bastards. It's okay, let him go now, Sava, we're going to be late for the show. What show? I don't give a damn about it! It won't be ruined without us. We don't have to go, Sava, I don't have to go! Anyhow, show is not a part of my working job. Okay, okay... -I said, enough! Good evening chief. Excuse me and where is that? -What? Some celebration... They noticed me... here, in a factory... That's the main entrance, here on the left. Thank you. -You're welcome. Gordana! Gordana, please! Kole, you have to stay for a snack, please. -I can't, I'm in a hurry. Let's start! -Dam is not here. Where is she? -Hello. Have you seen what we got? -They're recording? For "Belgrade News"? -No, that's our own TV. We have a documentation of every important event. -Really nice. We're ready. Good evening, comrade Kole. -Good evening. Let's start! Comrade Lukic! Comrade Lukic! Comrade Lukic... Sorry for the bothering... Gordana, Don't be like that, I believe you. I think that accusations are true. Anybody will do the same. I investigate everything. Deputy is one sick and dangerous man. Believe me, you're not only victim. Don't touch me. ...I have to go. -Just 5 minutes, Kole. There's no one to hand over a gift. Do that for us, comrade Kole. Go there, guests are here! Here, here... take it... here you are... Wait, here's for this little one... At this moment when we're overwelmed by sadness cause one busi worker is leaving, we have to be happy cause generations of pupils and teacher through all these 35 years had Dam as an example of capable and dear colleagaue, who with her human qualites left a remarkable trace in our institution. Jack Sava! -Cheers, son! Our collective decided to repay Dam in rather modest fashion. I'm glad that comdrade Kole is here, he's our contributor for many years now, and he sopported our school so many times in it's strife to get modern so I would ask him to hand over this gift. Easy, Sava! What's the hurry!? Did I asked you something? Stand up! This is check on 7 500 dinars. Don't people, it's too much. Come on! That's a sum in a rate of her two last wages. What's new with you, comrade Bosa? -Nothing... all the same. Here you are, it's real good. Sava... pull yourself together... Comrade director... -Yes, what is it? I don't know if it's convenient cause comrade Kole is present... We have a gramophone and records. -Great, bring it. Stop that yelling people, our ears hurt! Dam, I'll hold this for you, OK? Excuse, what did you take? -That's check from my mother. True, it's your mother's. This is yours and don't give that to anyone. Gordana! I know you're here... Gordana, tell something! Say something! I caught you! She's here, I saw her coming in. She's here. Here she is... here! You have seen that?! Have you?! Comrade deputy do you still negate that you misused your official placement. Me? That you're using intimidation to get employees of this collective to this gym. Me?! -Yes, you! Me? Me... was that me... was that me!? -Get away! Tell where is he, where's that bastard? Where... where... where is that bastard? You bastard... Come here, come, come! Bastard... Your resistance is futile. I understand you, you're ill and you need help. Come on, Tarzan, get down. Let me tell you one thing, biology teacher, Kristina, is taking kids on excursion at the same place for 10 years, cause bus firm gives her percentage from every trip, so children, instead of siteseeing our country, see same place over again and nothing else, like there's no other place to go on excursion. Water! Water, fast. Water! There's no need to, he's always doing that. Every time he's in some situation he starts to act that he's dying. Whore. Sava, please, don't. There is no one younger but you, you old fart? I'm joking, wait! What is it, something happened? You dance? -Take a walk! I said, take a walk! What does he want? He lost something? Is that yours? -No. Then leave it. Don't give that to anyone! Miloje! You showed up! I'm so happy! I'm here. -I already thought that you wouldn't. It would maybe be better that way. You claim that I'm benign guy but I'm really a malignant one. I came to torture you. Is that right? You won't hurt us... You're good. They talk everything about me around the schools. But good? Never. Continue, continue. I don't wanna interupt your celebration. Cake! You arranged this well. You never stinted on the staff. Is that right, auntie? -That's our cleaning woman. She retired today. That's Dam, right? Nice, nice... You're the only one that pullthrough... What is it? Why are you so stiffen? It seems like I ruined your night. Cira, play some dancing music. Good evening, comrade Miloje. What he's doing here?-I don't know he didn't leave since this morning. Get away! Get off man, let me go! For that carpets adress to him. I won't move a finger. -Don't even a hand... I don't talk with You. Bogdan... -What you said? Bogdan! -Quiet a little bit, I can't hear! Bogdan... -What Bogdan? He wants to suicide himself. There! Bogdan! -Silence! What's that room? -Teacher's restroom. Eh? -Quickly! Where? -There! What happened? -Is he finished?! Did he fell?! Did he fell? -He didn't. Just not to fall on his head. No, more important is that he don't injure eternal organs. If he feel on his head, he's finished. -It's not true, I heard that is much worse when you injure your eternal organs. Yes, but my daughter fell from 4 meters high but not on her head and she was OK. They thought that... They examined her head. When was that? When we were in Rome with package tour. -And then what? He left the key in the lock. I'll try something now.... Bogdan! -Shh, don't scare him. Watch out! I don't have space. -Get out of the way, out of the way! It's over. -It's not, how dou you know that? We would heard if he jumped. -Excatly! We should call Goca. -Bogdan! Are you there? Deputy, you have to live! Come on... let Goca through... Say something... Bogdan... Don't do that. Please. Something else. Come on, say. Come on! -Bogdan... Don't do that, for our love's sake. -That's right! Bogdan... I want it to... But I couldn't. While we were in that hovel that was anything but school, everything was OK. Now, when we have conditions like no one else, now people started to hate each other, got mad, raged. 10 years I begged so we can get building, I crossed half of Yugoslavia just to get cement, from that misery that was projected, I managed to scrounge gym, restaraunt, swiming pool. Everyone has a cabinet, teaching appliances are newest techology. While we were in that hovel, we had 250 pupils, and now that number is 1800. They send us delegations cause we're school for example. And now all of this. But why?! What's that teacher's name, the one that was champion of Serbia in average grades? The one that forced children to learn even on their break? He's not here anymore. -All the same, you have others... Say, how many pupils with highest rates you have this year? 60 percent? -47. Right. Is there anyone better than you? -No, why? You think that's normal? You plunged your head in the sand like ostrich and you push and push... What's next, hotel? So nobody leave home, so they can stay here and learn, so that you can have even higher average? Right? They pet this kids at home, nobody's assays them... When did some of your teacher walked with the pupil and talk to him just like that, besides the class? Papers, numbers, points, awards - that's what interests you. Tell me, Miroslav, why did I sent you here? You sent me to check thngs out. That's not your duty, I'm here to check things out. Tell me, what did I exactly told you when you came here? You told me... to go to school and see... -To see, not to check. That's difference. right? And, what else? You told me to get back immediately and on a way back to buy you tickets for cinema for 20:30. That's right. And I haven't told you to stay here all day and snoop around this people's school. You didn't but I thought that... -You thought? And who are you to think? Don't Miloje, he's young... -First day on a job and he's acting like this. He didn't do anything. How's that? He stepped over his authorization. He had the best intentions, I am a witness. Give me that delation, Miroslav. Here. Comrade Lukic... You are Gordana? Come here, please. Bogdan! Come. You want me to tear this up? I do. Continue, continue. Why do you sham? One moment. Listen, you have some war probation? -Why do you ask? You have awards, right? -Yes. For retirement, I think... -What? You can get invalid pension, I just thought... One moment, Bosa. What are you talking about, Miloje? I still can work. That's out of question cause of the Board. I thought that we can arrange you to get national pension, that's what I'm talking about. You understand? Come tomorrow and will figure out something. I don't want a retirement, Miloje! I want to work man! You want me to close the school, to throw you all out, to relieve all your pupils, to lead up frontdoor, you want that? Anyway, if I would only doing my job, I wouldn't care about your pension. Specially after what was said on the Board meeting ybout your school. Why, why can't we solve this nicely, like normal people so nobody gets hurt? Whatever, you make your own decision. I don't wanna rock, only tango, please. I caught all that jacks on the roof of the old house, they are changing the broken tile. All that jacks inside... Jacks, who called you? Why do you mess with my black roof, where white stork is standing, where fleecy grass is growing, my roof in the base of the long century? Why have you occupied my house? Why have you attacked it with hammers, nails, brushes, paints... Jacks, get out, let me arrange my house all by myself! They don't hear... They nailing my bones, paintning with my blood, they're taking out the old furniture from my heart, underable jacks, 30 of them standing on poor one me! They say, important guest will come, he will hunt a fog in a groves, he will encounter your house, it must be like from a fairytale. You take this mirror,comb your laughter in it, you face is underlayed with iron sadness. You jacks, what have you done, that's not my house, that's not my guest, that's not me anymore! You see my friend, what a school can do to a man. Come, let's go, Sava... He could be a jack, if he like it so much! -Come on, stand up! Let's go! -But that's not nice! Come on, come on... -You all gonna die! To die, all of you! Die! Teachers, intelectuals... I stick you on... -Don't yell! And you're going, Dam? -I am, Stole. Okay. Who knows why's that good, eh? So long. -Bye,Stole. Bye. Stop, stop, stop, stop. Start all over again. THE END
