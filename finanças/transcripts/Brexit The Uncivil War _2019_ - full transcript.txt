Subtitles by explosiveskull Britain makes a noise. An actual noise, did you know that? I feel I should almost apologise. It says here you basically ran the Leave campaign, and, yet... ..and, yet, I doubt most people have ever heard of you. It groans. It's been groaning for some time. Must be annoying, Old Boris getting all the credit. Oh, I don't seek the limelight. VOICEOVER: A hum, that only very few people can hear. Never stopping. Mr Cummings? This inquiry was established by the Information Commissioner's Office following revelations concerning the European referendum four years ago in 2016. Its primary purpose is to investigate the use of our personal data in political campaigns, and the way in which it is rapidly... FADING IN THE DISTANCE: ..altering democratic processes here... VOICEOVER: A million important questions to be asked of our nation. Our species, our planet, and no-one's asking the right ones. I mean, we're an education Think Tank, primarily. And, er, well, you were once special advisor to the Education Secretary, so... Your reputation precedes you. Although we'll try not to believe everything we hear. SELF-SATISFIED CHUCKLING VOICEOVER: All I hear is noise. Do you have any thoughts? Yeah, it's fucked, we're all fucked. What are your thoughts on providing strategy for our many clients? VOICEOVER: Be polite. Engaged. Don't tell them what you're really thinking. So... ..what do you think? What do I think? VOICEOVER: Just breathe, and think of Mary. Breathe? I think... Dominic? What do you think? VOICEOVER: Breathe. I think... VOICEOVER: Oh, shit. Stupid. You should advise your businesses that as a global society we are entering a series of profound economic, cultural, social and political transitions, the like of which the world has never seen. Educated people are the most stupid. Massive increase in resource requirements. You need an Odyssean education. A rising tide of religious extremism. A synthesis of...inter-generational inequality in the West on an historic level. Apollonian rationality and Dionysian intuition. I would tell them that for the past years, decades, even, this firm has failed... ..to prepare any of them for any of it. BRAKES SQUEAL It's not like the UK has experienced anything like Brexit before. Brexit will never be a win-win. The course that Brexit will take... ..of our approach to Brexit. No-deal Brexit. We live in a multiverse of differing branches of history. Brexit. Brexit. Brexit. Brexit. My question is do you consider your campaign to have acted within accordance of British Law? And, in a different branch of history, I was never here, some of you voted differently, and this never happened. But I was. And it did. Everyone knows who won. But not everyone knows how. MUSIC: Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 NEWSREEL: The battle of the continents becomes Europe's total war. In Amsterdam, Churchill proclaimed the need for a united Europe. General De Gaulle said "Non" to Britain joining the Common Market. People can work without restriction in any of the six countries. The particular problem is the price of food. Our entry into the EEC will make Europe the most powerful trading block in the world. We have our moment of opportunity. A chance of new greatness. Now we must take it. A splendid and decisive yes for Britain in Europe. I don't know what I'm voting for. I don't really see what good it's going to do us. We are asking for our own money back. We have not rolled back the frontiers of the state only to see them reimposed at European level. Suspending membership of the exchange rate mechanism. I will now form a majority Conservative government. Tomorrow, I will commence the process to hold a referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union. Sorry to mobilise you so quickly. No, no, that's what the WhatsApp group is for. Avengers Assemble. I don't really know what that is, but, erm, the past few years, a band of rebels has been meeting here regularly, away from, you know... It's very, erm, Tinker, Tailor. Well, it worked. We roused enough of the rabble to force Cameron's hand on a referendum, should he win the election. Obviously, not expecting to win outright. Well, he has, so it's happening. He'll be about to ask the biggest question a nation has asked itself in a generation, perhaps all generations - in or out? And we need a leader. Not me. Things are going to get pretty nasty. I can organise from the back, I can't lead an army. You need an attack dog for that. I have an idea. It is risky, though. He's different. HE RINGS DOORBELL DOG BARKS And if you want to be a dog kebab, keep barking! Dom. Hi. Hello. Can we, erm... Can we have a chat? Er, yeah. Sure, why don't you come in. Douglas Carswell. Douglas. Hello, hello. So... ..what have you been up to, the past few... ..months? Two years, chucked it all in. Went to live on my dad's farm. Did a little bit of work. Meditated. Wrote a lot. Read. Thucydides, Kipling, Tolstoy. Right... So, Dom, what we're looking for is... Uh-uh. No way, I promised myself I'd never set foot in Westminster again. You can run this however you want. Look, setting up a campaign is like setting up a multi-million pound start-up, except you're warning investors there's nothing to sell and no profit to be made from it. In other words, a fucking nightmare. Just leave those investors to me. Because I can leave strategy for the most part to you. No. Dominic. All your life you've been promised people would listen to your ideas, and time and time again, the Establishment got scared. They betrayed you. Here's your chance to really change things. Like never before. HE SIGHS It's OK. You can take your time. Of course. Except we don't have any. We need to be first out the gate. Before the pro-EU side you mean? I'm talking about our own side. You do you know who Arron Banks is? I know UKIP might give off this blokey, jokey vibe. But I'm afraid a lot of their views are... ..well, nothing to laugh about. If these right-wing thugs try and run the out campaign, they'll kill it. We need a more respectable alternative. No. No. No, Arron, you mad bugger. You mad bugger! THEY LAUGH How are you? I'm knackered. Sorry, Arron. I can't be angry at you. Come on, let's have a drink. I don't know. Seven tries at winning a seat, seven losses. And, now, the party too. Stitch up, arseholes, all of them. I'd put my fist down their throat, tear out their spine, only they don't have one. Stay. Lead. I said I'd resign. People come back from the dead all time, look at Jesus. He only came back twice, it'd be my third. But, you know, if... If I were to, then... I'm sorry to have to ask this, Arron, but... You want more money. He's back! I knew it! Now, look, this referendum, it's going to be a Tory-led, Westminster operation with us lot being edged out. Me! And I've been my whole bloody life fighting for this and I can't let that happen, and I won't! All right. All right. All right, let's gate-crash. Let's make a right bloody mess. HE CHUCKLES FREEEEDOOOOOOOOOM! THEY LAUGH DOOR CREAKS OPEN HE PRESSES LIGHT SWITCHES Hi! Victoria. Hi. Good morning. Morning. Douglas Carswell. Victoria Woodcock. Douglas, Matthew, when shall we three meet again? Speaking of... VOICEOVER: Gunpowder, treason, and plot. HE SIGHS We'll have the entire apparatus of the British State against us. They'll have the endorsement of all the major political parties. With their database of 40 million voters, who they are, where they are. Which we'll have no access to? We'll have to start from scratch. They get set the timetable, frame the entire debate. I know. I'll need total autonomy on the overarching philosophy. I did picture a more collaborative process. Absolutely. We'll, er, we'll work out the details. Let's get started. How to change the course of history, lesson one... ..kill conventional wisdom. Napoleon. Otto von Bismarck. Pay attention, Douglas. Alexander the Great. This is where we draw our wisdom from, the true disrupters of Europe. Socrates. Sun Tzu. Chairman Mao. That's all very well, first, we need to win designation. Only one group gets to campaign as the official In, one as the official Out. Then we test our messages with focus groups. What do you think I've been doing? I've already done it. So what is it you don't like about the European Union? Is it the size of it? What is it you don't like about the EU? What is it you don't like? What about it? The fact it's "over there"? Do you know who your MEP is? Do you know what an MEP does? You didn't know you had an MEP? You can't just go to a pub, Dom. There's a science to it. What about it? What about immigration? Is it immigration? Is it immigration? You can be honest, is it immigration? What about immigration? Is it race? Is it different races not mixing? Is it race? Not being integrated? People are feeling angrier. Left out. Ignored. What else? Don't think our kids will have a better future than us. Children's legacy. You think there should be a cap on immigration? Is it the numbers? Maybe it's the numbers? You think it's too many too? We spend more time than ever online, but we feel more alone. Ain't that the truth, Douglas?! Er... Is it the type of people they're bringing over? Is it too many? What's too many for you? You don't believe the numbers? You think they're not being counted properly, you don't think you can trust the figures? We're not getting married as much? Less of us have faith. We're not saving as much. We trust less the institutions and people our parents trusted. Except the NHS, which we love. But think it's fundamentally fucked. Which countries don't you like that have already joined? That have joined already? Why not? Why not? Why not? And who don't you want to join next? Who don't you want to join next? Why, why don't you want... Why? Why? Why not? Why? Why don't you? Turkey. Interesting. So it was... America, '92 campaign, that changed all campaigns. First of the Four Fundamentals to win this? Er... No? Message...discipline. Loss of national identity. Clear. Sovereignty. Digestible. Loss of community. Simple. Independence. Message repeated over, and over, and over. How did we get in to this? What's our message? What's our message? What's our message? What's our message? What's our message? What's our message? What's our message? It can't just be a slogan. We need to capture a feeling. What's the feeling? My father used to work on a rig. Oil. All those pockets of energy, hidden, deep down in the earth, built up over long periods of time. Groaning, moaning... ..waiting for a release, an outlet. All he had to do was find out where they were and start digging down, open up the well, and let that pressure out. We can tap into all these little wells of resentment, all these little pressures that have been building up, ignored, over time. We could make this about something more than Europe. Europe just becomes a symbol, a cypher, for everything. Every bad thing that is happening has happened. It's brilliant. Take...control. I like it. Simple, clear. Empowering. Brilliant. Let's get it out there. Maybe. I dunno. Maybe. We should start sounding it out with our growing band of MPs. Why? Well, their experience in this is invaluable. We don't need them, we're going to be making decisions based on science and data. No matter how counter-intuitive to traditional political thinking. No advertisers, no snake oil salesmen, or fucking Saatchis. We're gonna follow algorithmic, statistical analysis. We don't need to put up with any prima donna MPs. Understood? Sure. Sounds good. We need to make sure they're on side. They are the face of politics and don't we want as broad a coalition as possible? Also, Dom, I have invited a couple of them onto the board. A board? Ugh, I'll say. BOARD to death. A boring board game of players who should not be allowed to pass Go. JAUNTY CLASSICAL MUSIC These so-called political rebels, who, for 20 years of failing the Euro-sceptic cause, are still going to sit here and lecture me on how best to win this war, you watch. We wanted to share with you some of our experience of spearheading this movement, long before... ..well, before you came along. That'd be great. We'd, er, love to hear your ideas for the ground war. Well, I'm more concerned with the air war, actually. Digital. Social media. You mean the Facebook and things. Yep. I-I can see you're into all this new-fangled tech stuff, Dominic, and I'm sure that has a place, but the first step must be reaching voters direct. Old school, doorstep, stalls in market squares, posters. Posters? And for that, you need the MPs. As many on our side, as opposed to theirs. They have the local knowledge. Our focus will be on building a digital system that will provide us with the empirical evidence we need to understand who our voters are and what they want to hear. I knew it, I warned you. I think what Dom means is... Some of us have been waiting a lifetime to get to this point. Not to have it ruined by some... ..some geeky anarchist who wants to show off. I just want to get us over the line, something that MPs have failed to do since this movement begun over 40 years ago. Excuse me. With respect, this referendum is a really dumb idea. What?! I think what we're emphasising is... Referendums are quite literally the worst way to decide anything. Dom. They're divisive, they pretend that complex choices are simple binaries, red or blue, black or white, and we know there are more nuanced and sophisticated ways out there, to make political change and reform, not that we live in a nuanced, or political age, do we? Political discourse has become utterly moronic, thanks to the morons who run it. Really. But there it is. If that is the way it is to be, then I will get us across the line, in whatever way I can, but in order to do that, we have to restack the odds in our favour. We have to hack the political system. Hack it? Like a cyber hack. Get in through the back door, reprogram the system so it starts working for us. You're talking about posters and flyers, I'm talking about altering the matrix of politics. Dominic, for the love of God, you need to learn to be a little more patient... I won't suffer fools, therefore I won't suffer 90% of politicians. Frankly, I don't see the point in them, and... What the fuck? Dominic, I'm so sorry, they just, like, barged their way in. I'll leave you to it. So, chaps, why the bloody hell aren't we working together? Hm? Your campaign, our campaign, as one. Unstoppable. I've got call centres. I've got money - nine million quid I've donated - before the spending ceiling kicks in, which I think is the largest donation in British political history. Is that right, Nige? Yeah, that's right, Arron. And what have you got? Ah, experience. Expertise. Contacts in Parliament, of course, the MPs. MPs are useless, fuck the MPs. Everything you've been briefing on so far, not one mention of immigration. That's on purpose, we don't want to bring... Oh, don't come over all bleeding bloody hearts, it's bollocks. You know, you turn up for five minutes and you think you know the lot. Well, I have been fighting with this my whole life. And I know what lands. People already know what they think about immigration, the people we're trying to win over, the people we need to win, extend beyond UKIP. Oh. So you don't want to make the bien pensants sitting around your London dinner table uncomfortable? We don't need 'em, we need normal people. We need 50% of the entire country, plus one. Second fundamental of running a successful campaign - build a broad coalition of voters. And for that you need to be respectable. No offence. 'Scuse me. Let me tell you who we're up against, who's setting themselves up, over the river, to destroy us. Lucy Thomas, ex-producer of BBC's Newsnight programme. So she'll know how to handle the press. Director of the campaign - Will Straw, son of Jack, failed his MP race in 2015. Typical establishment thinking - if it didn't work first time, try it again. Ryan Coetzee, Director of Strategy, he's Nick Clegg's former special adviser. Labour and Lib Dem hate each other post-coalition. That won't work. Oh, yeah, no, it's a proper left and centre-left love-in. You've got the Greens, and the Welsh, but not as interesting as these, the one true enemy they both share. Tories. The Number Ten machine. Headed up by - trumpets please... Craig Oliver. Cameron's communication director? Position held, as we know, by a long succession of bastards. Campbell. Coulson. This one's more out-of-the-limelight, ostensibly in control, composed, he's furiously loyal to his boss. I can tell you that we, er, well, we have a little history. Dominic Cummings is basically mental. We had to all but ban him from Number Ten. He's desperate to be seen as this visionary architect of a new world order, but actually he's just an egotist with a wrecking ball. It does, however, mean that he's... Well, he's, unpredictable. I know how to beat Oliver. Conventional wisdom is a disease that the British are peculiarly susceptible to, and he certainly hasn't been inoculated. I want to be upfront. The PM isn't entirely sure why all this shouldn't be run by and out of Number Ten, so... I'm sure you don't mean to imply that you're here to give us the once-over, check us out. No, that's exactly what I meant. Andrew Cooper, our chief pollster. Hello. Our lead strategist on the Scottish Independence ref, which we won. Just. Which we won, despite those final polls, and the general election, which we also won - ditto. So take comfort in that we do actually know how to win things which, present company, politely and respectfully... Look, we know there are historic divides between us all. But without getting all Hollywood about coming together for the greater good, that is basically what we're going to have to do. I'm not saying let's all have a circle jerk. Circle what? Jesus. But this is about as serious as it gets. There's the danger which we saw in Scotland of having unleashed something which we can't then control. An establishment enemy needs a people's army to thrash them! You need Nigel, he should front the TV debates, do the rallies. We will be guided by data and polling, Nigel may be an asset, maybe not, we'll see. Nothing personal. Ah, fuck this. He's a fucking waste of space. Christ. That's a lot of money walking out of the door. That is a mathematical paradox walking out of the door. Every time that Nigel Farage's popularity increases nationwide, the support for Brexit decreases nationwide. Puts everyone else off. So, no! But they'll be out there anyway, gobbing off. Wouldn't it be better to have them pissing out of the tent rather than pissing in? If we can control their rhetoric, on... Oh, unless we get them to do the heavy lifting on the migration stuff, and then we can keep our hands clean? That is a dangerous game, Dom. They're going to do what they're going to do, we'll do what we do. Parky, where are we at? THEY MURMUR ACKNOWLEDGEMENT How do? I wasn't aware you were a member. I just joined. What are the odds? Would you like any assistance with your hair or just general...? No, no, I'm fine, thanks. I mean, unless you can help it grow back. Why do you think your lot will get the designation over Farage? He's the face of the anti-EU cause. Yeah, but their arguments will only reach a narrow base. Whereas, ours, we hope, will reach everyone. How are you getting on, your side? We shouldn't be talking... Don't be a dick, John, why the hell are there two competing Out teams, both fighting for the same donors, MPs? It makes no bloody sense. We should join together. Cummings would never allow that. Why not? He hates you. What are your expectations, realistically? Well, ideally it would be to create the biggest political upset the world's seen since the fall of the Berlin Wall. So what does your campaign look like? I'd like to think it looks like an insurgence against the establishment. You're not looking to be more collegiate, respectful, than that? Why? It's a fucking war. Total war. In total war, there's only one side left standing. You'd be fine about bringing down the Prime Minister? He deserves to be brought down, the Prime Minister's crap. Are you reading this? I don't mind him having the odd bit of publicity, but hell's fucking bells, he attacked the PM! Does he not know there are things you do not do? Does he always have to be so... you know - himself?! PHONE RINGS Hello. Matthew? It's Dan. We need to talk about Dom. BICYCLE BELL CHILDREN GIGGLE IN THE DISTANCE Dominic? Zack Massingham, Aggregate IQ. Was pleased to get your message. We've been trying to get in touch with you, actually. Really? You were surprisingly hard to find online, for an online analytics company. Not really in the business of advertising what we do. Which is what? Just so that I am absolutely sure it's what I need. Technically, we use sophisticated algorithms to micro-target populations in political campaigns. The other side has a voter database that I don't have access to, and I need to build my own, find voters, and target them with our ads. We're becoming a little more sophisticated than that now. Arron, this is Robert Mercer, an old family friend, and an investor in, well, all of this. Nigel, good to see you again. London was always going to be a key front in our cultural war against the political class. It feels like something's coming, doesn't it? Fuck, I hope so. I should introduce you to Steve. Steve Bannon, chairman of Breitbart. He's also on the board of one of my other little projects. A data-mining company, election specialists, combined. It's new. Just been working on Ted Cruz's campaign. When we began he was only polling 3%. We got him up into the forties. An unprecedented leap. Simply through behavioural micro-targeting, finding where the voters you can convert are, and knowing the messages that will convert them. Silicon Valley, eh? It's my kind of people. The Brits. Cambridge Analytica. And beyond. He went to a refugee camp in the Lebanon and he said you must understand that 2% of these people are Jihadi activists. Now, that's the truth. Money is one thing, Mr Banks, but data is power. You see, this is all just beginning. Technology has moved beyond "you like this, so you might like that". Internet algorithms learn about our behaviour, our psychology even, our emotional state. These social media platforms know what questions we're asking, what keeps us awake at night, when we sleep, where we go, who we go there with, and therefore the system can make predictions. And does. Embarrassingly accurate ones. Such as? OK, so, like, Facebook knows when you're falling out of love with your partner. Yeah. It didn't mean to discover it, wasn't its intention, but two billion people constantly inputting into the database a dozen times a day? Patterns form. Behaviours overlap. So, what, it just targets, or micro-targets, your message? That's all? Mmmm, not just all. What it means is that we can design and distribute thousands of different adverts that vary, depending on who we're sending them to. So, your timeline will be slightly different to your friend's, your mum's, and so on. And our software can test how effective certain ads are on certain people, in terms of liking, clicking, sharing, and then learn how to adapt them, to improve them, in real time. In real time? Mm-hm. What's in it for you? Truthfully? Our problem is that we haven't found a large enough test case yet to understand this technology's effectiveness. A decent sample size. So we're just a trial, is that all? What, British democracy is a lab experiment for a greater prize? Blanket advertising is dead. We're updating and uploading all the time, by choice, teaching data companies and advertisers exactly who we are and what we want. Data that leads political parties to individual voters, with a message that is algorithmically tailored towards them. Look, it was Obama who led the way on this. A liberal. It's not about right versus left, it's about old versus new. This is the new politics, Dom. This is how you will win. KNOCK AT DOOR It was entirely made of rubber. THEY CHUCKLE Oh, hello. Come in. How, are you? How nice to see you. John. Come and sit over there. Thank you. Tea? Oh, yes, please. Milk? Sugar? Er, a spot of milk. It's not just his me-me-me-ness, Matthew, fact is, his personality alienates people. David Cameron called him a career sociopath. Do you know, when he visits various Whitehall departments, he signs in as Osama Bin Laden, just for the sheer...! I don't know...he's just... He's so, he's so.... Inappropriate. Annoying. Yes, he is, he is - annoying. Do you know, Andy Coulson, the bloke in jail for phone hacking, he thought Cummings was too toxic to win broad support! Andy Coulson! Yeah, I-I-I know Dom can be, uh, unconventional, but there's no-one better to rally the troops. You, Matthew. It has to be you. You're only talking about locating people that the other side already have on the government database. You're thinking way too small. No-one's ever accused me of that before. What about those who are off the grid, who don't vote? Social media platforms are designed to find like-minded people better than people can. Our system will locate and target people that no campaign has ever targeted before - people who don't and have never voted. Anti-establishment, angry. Your people. Dominic, we have already started to find them. Three million extra votes. Fuck off. All of them yours. That the other side have no idea exist. Where's Matt? PHONE RINGS Hello? Cummings? Yes? It's John Mills. Wonder if you might come over. The board would like a word. Would you take a seat, Dom? Very busy, what is it? Dom, I'm afraid we, on the board, have lost confidence in you. You've pissed off just about every MP that's been trying, desperately, to support us, rather than that other Ukippy lot. And you, you seem to flout about TV and the front pages of magazines whipping up controversy, and so... Thank you, Bernard. Look, what I think we can all agree on is that the infighting has to stop. And if that means changes to the structure of the campaign, well, then... Basically, we'd like to offer you a lot of money just to quietly step to one side. Stay on as a consultant, and let others take more of a lead. And Matthew? This is the decision of the board. DOM INSIDE VOICE: They're scared. This is rushed. Poorly planned. What do you think will happen to my senior staff over the river? What do you mean? They'll walk. Well, it's your patriotic duty to tell them not to, Dom. They'll do what they want to do, Dan. Because they are intelligent people. Unlike you and Matthew, they know how to run a campaign. You'll lose your campaign machine, and you'll lose your designation. Well, what do you suggest we do about that? You don't know what you're doing, do you, any of you? This is embarrassing. You've committed the classic cardinal sin of any failed coup, you didn't secure the support of your military first, and you didn't seize the state broadcaster. What are you doing? In about 30 seconds, you're going to start receiving notifications on the WhatsApp group, staff resigning. Ah, no, no, wait, wait a minute, Dom. Hell's fucking bells! This is a private meeting, you can't just... Just did. MESSAGE NOTIFICATION TONES Look, can we all just stay calm, and not... I'm calm. It's not just your attitude, it's the strategy you're putting together. Where's immigration, where's the bloated bureaucracy, the supranational institutions of... Too nebulous, too complicated, too remote. This campaign is going to be about cost and control. That's it. We know whereof we speak, Dom. No, you don't. No, you don't. You're wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong! How much it costs! And regaining control! Cost and control! Cost and control, get it? You see - this is what we have to deal with. And, while I'm at it, when we gain the designation, and the £7 million spending limit, I would like to spend 3.9 million of that online. You're...you're treating this like it's a game, Dom, your private plaything. We have this contract for you to sign, just look it over and... No. But there's... We have lawyers, waiting next door. Not lawyers?! Oh, fuck! If you don't like they way I'm running the campaign, you can leave. Us? No, this is about YOU leaving. Well, I'm not, so you can go. I think, perhaps, a compromise. Dom, you don't like dealing with MPs, they clearly don't like you. I'm happy to do that from now on. And if we can just be a little more discreet, with our tweetings and our utterances, I think... ..I think that could help. That would...that would be a help, yes. And if you would be willing to share the strategy side with us, Dom... No, I have complete independence or nothing. Well, then, you can't be on the board, because the board will need to hold you to account. Fine, then I think we need a new Chair... ..if things are changing on the board. A fresh start. MOBILE PHONE VIBRATES So, is he gone? He didn't go. Stop it. I did. Fuck off! What? How?! I'm not sure. Continue. Continue! Hiya. Why don't people like me? I like you. Come here. Well, at least they will remember you. That's something. He's kicking. Like his dad. That was corny. A very good evening to you, and welcome to BBC News. Vote Leave and Britain Stronger in Europe have been designated the official Leave and Remain campaigns in the EU Referendum. ..three, two, one! CHEERING AND APPLAUSE And we're off! The ten-week count down to the Referendum has begun in earnest with the designation of the two campaigns. Stronger In, backed by the Prime Minister, Jeremy Corbyn, and almost all mainstream parties. On the Leave side, Vote Leave, which contains six cabinet ministers, and 140 Conservative parliamentarians. Vote Leave everyone, Vote Leave! APPLAUSE ON TV: What were your thoughts when these decisions where announced? Well, Huw, there have been real divisions... Fuck them! ..those who are campaigning for the UK to leave Europe. Now we're free from any constraints, we can do what we like. It's more fun being outsiders. Turn it off. We also know that the other side are going to run a campaign the way campaigns have been run for pretty much the last 70 years. They're going to fight from the centre, make it about jobs and the economy. We focus on the economy and jobs. The message - leaving risks both. Clinton, '92, best campaign ever. "It's the economy, stupid." You define your opponent as the riskier option. And, though the change candidate might initially poll well, come election day, the nerves kick in, voters revert back to the centre. Law of political science, if the status quo are ahead before the campaign begins, which we are, they always win on the day. So... So, what's our answer? Tzu's The Art of War. If we fight them on home terrain, they will win. So, what we need to do is lead them to the ninth battlefield, the deadly ground, where no-one expects to find themselves. Outcome? They perish. Which means? You reverse the proposition. We make them the risky option. To stay is to risk losing more of the things we cherish. We're asking voters not to reject the status quo, but to return to it. To independence. How much does it cost us, each week, to be members of the EU? In the regions of about... What's our researcher's name? Richard. Ricardo! Will you get me all the figures of how much it costs to be members of the EU for a week! Largest one wins. Make sure it's verifiable! Focus groups. Finding out who we are, and what are we like, so we can segment and target. First, the easiest, we have the Ardent Internationalists. 11% of the voting population. Support gay marriage, degree educated. Going to vote to stay, no matter what. Then the other end, the EU Hostiles. Similarly 11%. Generally retired, mortgage-free. And 98% white. Won't change either. And then we have our Comfortable Europhiles, own their own home, get their news from the BBC. Most probably remain. And our Strong Sceptic. C2DEs, generally 55 plus, O-levels and no higher, most probably Leave. It's not rocket science, it's simple. There are three types of voter. Those certain to vote to exit that's one third, they're in the bag, so, ignore them. Those certain to stay, that's another third, we can't touch them, so fuck 'em. The last third "I would like to leave, but I'm worried about "what the effect will be to jobs and living standards." These are the only people that we need to care about. And, trust me, the others will be after the same bunch. Now these are who will decide the result. The Hearts versus Heads, and the Disengaged Middle. 34% of the electorate. Hearts Verses heads are mainly female. Sandra Butcher. Oh, hi, Sandra. Get their news from Mail Online. Their heart says Leave, but their head is worried. "Disengaged Middles" are generally renters, get their news from Facebook. Most have never given any thought to the EU whatsoever. Erm, who is "very likely" to vote in the upcoming referendum, show of hands? OK, good. Erm, Shamara, are you likely, unlikely, very unlikely, or don't know? I'd say likely but I just need to get my head round. Don't know, for me. If someone can convince me either way, then probably, but... So, what do you think of when you think of the EU? What does it do? They make laws. For each country. Laws over there that overturn laws over here. Only they're not accountable. Well, you do, you do vote for them. MEPs. I don't. Well... It's, it's the courts, it...it...isn't it? Erm, they have the Human Rights. Which, I'm sorry, but things like the terrorists you can't deport. Which, well... That's freedom of movement, isn't it? Goods and people? That's what the old community was for, right? Erm, no tariffs, free trade... Old community was coal and steel. That's all it was meant to be. But now it's got too big. Yeah, not people, I mean not unlimited people, that's not what the meant, when they... It's for peace though, isn't it? After the war. To make sure nothing like that, happens again. Which is, I think, probably good? You know just to be, you know, I mean I'm not saying it's wrong, people coming, different people, it's...it's just if we had, er, like a point system. No, no, no. Like Australia. That undermines the whole thing. I'd be fine with that. And we go there as well. So, what's the issue that matters most, then, when you're making your decision? Is it what's best for the economy? Or is it control over immigration? Economy. Every time. Immigration is not an issue. I'd like to be able to study abroad. We need to appeal to their heads, numbers, projections. We focus on the facts. We need to appeal to their hearts. Emotional resonance. Their hopes. Their dreams. Their aspirations. Their fears. Their suspicions. Now these Persuadables, we need to learn about them, love them, and lure them onto our side. There are more of them out there than we thought. Three million more of them out there than we thought. That's three million potential voters not on any voter database so Remain have no idea they exist. If we can reach them, they're ours for the taking. Dom, what on Earth are you talking about? I want less than ten people on Earth to know what I'm about to tell you. We're going to build something. By the way, if anyone asks, just tell them you're a junior intern. Look, I'm serious, nothing more than that. I'm in my 30s. But you've got your youthful, Californian complexion. Canadian. Let me know if you need anything. What do you think of it? No, not right, send it back. What? Dom, we've printed thousands off. It's not ready, burn 'em! Hello, sorry, Mr Gove, sir, it's Dom here. I know you're tearing yourself up inside, but I really need your answer. Can you call me back? OPERA PERFORMANCE IN BACKGROUND Everyone should join us if we're going to win. Exactly. We're the original and still the best. Ultimately, look, I have a simple view on this, just like I have a simple view on everything in life. If you want to leave the EU, you're on our side. Even if you think you are on theirs. On the Remain side you mean. No, I mean Leave. The other Leave. To take something back means it was, is, rightfully yours, taken from you. So much of our understanding of who we are, comes from this nostalgic view we have of our past. These stories, these myths we tell each other. Normally, I hate them, they stop me from progressing, but, in this case, let's use it. The idea that we want to return to a time when we knew our place. When things made sense, fictional or not. It's perfect. Better start taking it back. REPORTERS CLAMOUR Michael? David and Samantha Cameron are your close friends, does this not feel a bit like stabbing your leader "in the front"? Um... ..it, well, you know, um... The fact is, if you must know, I've been wrestling with this for weeks. This was the most difficult decision of my political life. But taking difficult decisions is what politicians are here to do. Yes, yes, yes, exactly, it's... ..it's, it's easy to shirk them - to not upset the applecart. It's a perfectly legitimate way of playing devil's advocate with... Who are all this lot? Matthew's idea. Different outreach groups, operating independently. Who's funding them then? Who's coordinating them? I think they're meant to co-ordinate themselves. I don't know, rules sketchy. But the versions of your column, Boris, including the one you wrote in support of Remain? Oh, look now, it's as if none of you have ever written a pros and a cons list before... You know, people do that when they're about to do something important, like maybe, adopt a puppy or something. Thank you, thank you, I think that's probably all we've got time for. REPORTERS CLAMOUR Well done, well done. Good line about the puppies. Yes, well, it's done now so c'est la vie. Well done. David said...he said that if I get what I want, and we win this, it will destroy him. He's probably right. This is a game changer, so thank you. All right, team. Listen up! Now the fight for Britain really does begin. We have our star endorsements. And...and we have our message. If you look on the server, you'll find copies of the War Book! Here's our message in a sheet. Here's our message in a paragraph. Here's our message in a sentence. If you find a potential voter, you hit them hard. If it looks like they're going to bend, then you don't just walk away, pat yourself on the back, you double down. Hit them again. And again, right, with £350 million and Turkey! 350 million quid and Turkey. Again! ALL: 350 million quid and Turkey! Again! ALL: £350 million and Turkey! Again and again. Show no mercy! All right? Good. Get out there and do that! Take back control. Ta-da! Wait, wait, wait, wait, that's the... We're using the NHS, with the economy, with control. But...but the logo. That's the actual NHS logo? I know. Are we...are we allowed to just...? Imagine their faces! I mean, if Jeremy Hunt wants to come down and try and peel the label off himself, he's more than welcome, we'll have the cameras ready. Let's take back control! Let's take back control! Terrific! It's marvellous. It's got air conditioning and everything. Three? Million, yes. Completely off the map. Rendering their current poll projections pointless. Holy Moley! So you're saying there's a cat in Lucifer's chance we might actually win this thing, are you? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Well, we need to brief this, get it out there. A great big psychological boost to all those guys. No, no, no briefing. All right? A polling lead for Remain make them complacent, means less voters turn out, we keep it hush hush. You really don't have to raise your hand. Oh, sorry, I just wanted to ask who they were. Data scientists. I'm a data scientist. They're technically physicists. Blimey. Where are they from? Prior to this they were working analysts on the Hadron Collider. And now you're here to tell us what housewives in Newport think, bravo. All right. Fanfare, please! For the first time in a British election, we've built some software that will combine your Facebook and your Twitter with the electoral roll and polling, and canvassing, all in one database that can be updated and respond in real time. Fabulous! Really? I have no idea. Here are some if the ads we've been developing that are ready to test. Look at this one. For the Euro Championship. Football. Not politics! Football! It's brilliant. A chance to win 50 million quid if you guess the result to every single game. The odds to winning are six trillion, the point is that we can collect hundreds of thousands of contact details to get people out to vote. It's like 20 questions. With every click we know you better so our ads can target you better. And this one? I thought we weren't pushing immigration. The software will tell us what to push or what not to push, Michael. To win, OK? Right. Ready to launch? Yeah. TRIUMPHAL CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYS What I will say is, er, it's obviously very important we don't get mired, er, in personal politics. Let us confirm that tomorrow we we're going strong on manufacturing, PM is in Derbyshire, meeting in the Toyota factory. Hi, you have David Cameron on the line. Hi, it's Iain Duncan-Smith. I'm calling on behalf of the Vote Leave campaign. All aboard for Britain remaining in the European Union. This should be an amicable contest that's characterised by mutual respect. One that rises above personal attacks, and stays true to that Great British tradition of fair play. Nothing can dilute our enthusiasm. Hello, madam, vote Leave. Hi there. EU referendum. So let's raise the level of debate and have a fair fight. Um, yep! So don't get mad, but just as an experiment, I set up a fake Youth Labour group to campaign for Remain. They're including us on their e-mail list. You are kidding me. Not only that - Craig Oliver does a conference call to volunteer groups a couple of times a week. And we have the dial-in code. So, what do you reckon? Dom did say "double down". Please enter the conference pin. The next thing is a heads-up on the press release. This is under embargo until tomorrow. It's announcing an emergency budget should we leave. TYPING ON KEYBOARD So this is where you... where you hide, is it? Do you mind if I pop in for a moment? Gosh. The software's coming back with new voters. Thousands of them. We should get out there and test it. Dom, I... ..think we should clear the air about what happened with the board. Let's go. But... Ah, well, I don't know this place. Well, it's in your constituency, Douglas, you just ignored it for years. Thank you. But what if...what if they... My face is quite recognisable - maybe I should... Look, either you believe in this or you don't. If you don't, get back in the fucking cab. Hello. All right? WOMAN: What's he done now?! I don't understand, how did you find us? No-one knocks on that door. You're telling me that no other political parties have knocked on your door during this...referendum? I'm saying no-one from a political party has knocked on that door since about the eighties. Could we persuade you to register today, do you think? You can try. Honestly, though, I don't trust any of you. You look familiar, though. Well, the first thing we think leaving the EU will help is jobs. Haven't got a job. Never will again round here. 24 years as a steel worker, all gone to shit. How you gonna fix that? Well, that...that is one of the industries that's been most affected by EU overregulation. All of that red tape and cheap foreign labour that's undercutting your wages. Oh, yeah, I know. Huh! They work for nothing. People like me, we get, like... We get squeezed out. Yeah. We get squeezed out. It's not that I'm against them. No! But it has changed a lot round here, hasn't it? All our neighbours have moved away and new people come in. My kids have moved away too now, cos there's nothing here, and I miss it. I miss having...having... Oh, you're getting me all upset now. Sorry, we don't mean to pry. You want to feel back in control of your life. Or the lives of the people you love. Perhaps we could leave you with this. Erm, now, remember it's not... ..it's not a parliamentary election it's a referendum... DISTORTED: ..where every vote counts. And with your polling station being just around the corner... RUMBLING The noise. It's getting louder. Much louder. What does it mean? What's it trying to tell us? RUMBLING PULSATES You are on the front page of The Observer this morning. A warning that a million people may come here from Turkey in the next eight years, which is strange because very few people expect Turkey to join the EU in the next eight years. We... I do not think that the EU is going to, er, keep Turkey out. I think it is going to join. I think the migrant crisis... What I'm asking of the world's oldest public broadcaster is an understanding of the difference between impartiality and balance. What I mean is that your nonsense bloody quota of giving equal coverage, no matter what, means that we put up a Nobel Prize-winning economist to highlight the negative impact on sterling if we leave, and then you feel you have to give equal weight to some batty backbencher who's just there to parrot, "Not true! "Project Fear! Take back control!" Yes, well, it fucking better do! I look forward to it! It's going to be OK, they've found a momentum, but we'll counter. We just have to stop falling into their trap. They say something utterly ludicrous, like, "Turkey will join, "we can't stop them." Then we drop what we're doing to counter with the truth, when what we're actually doing is just helping them by spending the rest of the day saying, "Turkey, Turkey, Turkey" on the radio! It's grenade after grenade! They lob one over here. Bang! We go over to put out the fire, they lob one over there - bang, over we go! It's guerrilla warfare! They can say literally anything they want with zero consequences because they're not the Government, whereas we take a bloody millennia to sign off a sodding Twitter meme! It's kind of genius, in a way. You know what? I'm beginning to lose patience with this common misconception that Dominic Cummings' pseudo-intellectual bullshit is anything other than pseudo-intellectual bullshit! Anyone can start a fire. He's not the Messiah. He's a very naughty... ..fucking arsehole! And as this is a bank holiday, we'll be talking about whether hedgehogs could derail the Government's plans for HS2. BBC News is read by Zeb Soanes. Ministers have begun moves to change tipping practices in bars and restaurants. Waiters... Why aren't we getting any pushback from this? Why aren't journalists hounding us about it? The metropolitan commentariat are not our targets, so they're not seeing our posts on their timeline, so they have no idea what the rest of the country is seeing. So no-one's reporting it. Feels dangerous, doesn't it? Girls, this is the last time! TV off, come and eat! I've made you some lovely supper. OK, now, remember that Daddy has to speak very, very quickly to the Prime Minister, so you and your friends are going to eat really, really quietly and be good, right? I don't like this! Right? PHONE RINGS BEEP Prime Minister is on. Hi, DC. Hi, it's Dave! How is everyone? Hi, David. This is Thomas. Hi, Andrew Cooper here. Who just joined? It's Peter Mandelson. Sorry I'm late. I kept typing the pin thing in, but it wouldn't bloody... Yuck! I don't like ketchup. Hello, Peter! Isn't this a strange little get-together? You can say that again! HE CHUCKLES So, I think we can all admit that we have a problem. Yep? Andrew? On the question of economy, jobs, and safety, voter association, it seems to be moving steadily in the direction of...of Leave. I thought WE were hard on the economy and THEY were immigration! I know, I can't... What are the polls telling us? It's all over the place. It's like there's a gremlin in the machine, but they seem to be cutting through to the undecideds. The Labour MPs I have coming back from doorsteps are spooked. Our lines on jobs, the economy - voters don't want to hear it. Warnings of an economic shock don't work in areas that are already deprived. The numbers have been telling us... Andrew, the numbers are wrong. Daddy, can I have the juice? Something is going wrong here. Well, is it, perhaps, because 47% of Labour voters don't know which side their party actually bloody supports? Now, we clear the grid on a daily basis for Corbyn and he backs out time and again, and when he does speak, he sounds... What do you want me to say? Jeremy voted to leave in '75, and he hasn't changed his mind on anything for 40 years! CHILD BLOWS RASPBERRY If we're blaming each other's parties, Johnson and Gove continually making personal attacks against you lot, their own Government, and you're not attacking back! Internal Tory spats distract from the message. Anyway, we do actually need a Conservative Party after the vote. Well, you'll forgive me if my main concern right now isn't the Tory Party after the sodding vote - it's the state of the whole county now, and you're making us fight them with one arm tied behind our back. If I can also say, if the economic issue isn't cutting through, then we have to have a response, a positive argument on immigration. That's them leading us onto their turf, it's a trap. We can't ignore it any more! This is...serious. All right. Nothing to lose, I suppose, apart from the European Alliance and even the United Kingdom itself! HE CHUCKLES Too soon? Hello, everybody! Really good to see you. So good to see you! Thank you for coming out. I think we are better off in. I think we're stronger in. I think we're safer in. Better off. Safer. Stronger. Let's take back control! Take back control. Take back control. Take back control. We take back control of our money, our laws and, of course, our borders. Who thinks we should remain? The IMF, the World Bank, the Bank of England. The real risk to Britain's economy. A bomb under our economy. The people of this country have had enough of experts. It's just scaremongering! Project Fear. It's scaremongering. Project Fear. This Government sponsored a fiction, claiming that Brexit will cost us £4,300. I mean, does Project Fear know no bounds? Don't throw away your children's future. The EU has made a fundamental mistake, which is affecting the security of all of us. They swept across the Continent. Say it loud, say it clear! Refugees are welcome here! The Leave campaign is now trying to stir up prejudice. You might as well just hang up a sign that says, "Terrorists Welcome"! It's been Project Hate, as far as immigration's concerned. They're not refugees, they're economic migrants, and there's a difference. Leaving Europe would be bad for the NHS. 70 million Turks. Unprincipled fiction! They lied about the cost of Europe. They lied about Turkey's entrance to Europe. Why on Earth did you risk this? Because they're British! Our daughter couldn't get into her school! Let me finish, Christine. You don't know exactly... Let me make my point. ..what's going to happen, you don't know the exact figures! How are we going to pay for the National Health Service? You are not paying for it now! The Mayor's just got in and said there's no money to build these 50,000 homes that he said he was going to build! Thank you. Thank you. Gosh, I feel like a bloody rock star! I can't believe how whipped up everyone is! I knew you were one of the good ones off the telly! You know, saying what the people really think. Thank you, thanks. 70 million Turks coming over here! I mean, it's just... It's frightening. Well, yes, we don't actually know how many, or when, or... It says... It says in your flyer, look. Look. Yes, well, that is, er... ..just the actual population of, er, Turkey. We should probably go, Boris, sorry. There we are. Yay! Take back control! BUS HORN BEEPS # Here we go, here we go Here we go! # Here we go, here we go! # BUS HORN BEEPS Yeah, yeah, but come on, come on! Hospitals would totally collapse without migrant workers. Then, give those jobs to British workers! Oh, come on! Tell them that unemployment for British-born is dropping. Say that. But the argument that migrants bring in more in taxes than they take out in services? Yes, good, now follow up. But how much of their wages are they sending home, out the country? She's just said, they pay more in taxes. They've got kids! As long as they pay! Any more thoughts on that? That's it, I'm going in. Wait! No, that breaks the whole... She's not testing our argument! OK, that... Yeah, yeah. Sorry. Sorry to interrupt. Sorry, who are you? The hard facts, right? The Treasury receives a net benefit of £20 billion a year from EU workers paying into the system... Says who? ..growing the economy. That's after using public services, so they are paying for more care, more teachers, more... That's not a good thing? Yes, no-one's saying that's not the truth. Sorry! How much are WE paying to be over there? Yeah? 350 million! A week! OK, so have none of you heard our messages on...? That £350 million is a lie! You would say that! No, it does not exist, it has never existed! A cheque for that amount has never been signed! We will not get it if we leave! Project Fear! What will happen is that our... Project Fear! Listen to the man! ..our currency will collapse, and the economy will contract. How do you know that? You lot get things wrong all the time. I don't know why we pay anything. To be a member of the single largest trading bloc in the entire world! But what benefit am I seeing from that where I'M from? I'd rather it go on the NHS, like they're saying. Oh, you do realise? This is, yeah, bad. The people making these promises, people you have never heard of - Dominic Cummings - they're not elected, they're not going to form a government, despite having made billions of pretend spending promises post-Brexit that they have no power, or responsibility to see any of it through! OK, we could take a little break. Or Arron Banks and his diamond mine in South Africa, or Nigel Farage, the old stockbroker. Boris Johnson, Jacob Rees-Mogg - yeah, they're going to be fine, aren't they? This is just a game to them! A debating society. But the risk to you and your children... There's no risk! Come to where I'm from, there's nothing to lose! We've got something to lose - our age. Yous lot have had your lives! I've had my life?! What do you know about my life? You've had your jobs and homes and things, it doesn't matter to you, yeah? Take a risk, sod it, thank you very much! I haven't been lucky, I've lost everything! You're nervous about people with a different colour skin and accent. Oh, I am sick of being called that! What did I call you? What did I say? You know what you were calling me! No, I don't! Racist! Racist! Racist! That's what! Exactly when did I say that? You were saying that! Sorry, she's right, all right? Hate crimes - there's one bloke near me... And that's my fault, is it? All right, it's true! We can't say nothing now without that coming up! THEY ALL TALK AT ONCE There's no need to... It wasn't on purpose. You can stand there all you like and say, "I've had my life," coming from your big city! The past years have been fucking awful! If you must know! That's my fault. And all I hear all the time is, "Shut up, don't talk about it, don't mention it, ever!" Well, I'm sick of it! I'm sick of feeling like nothing, like I have nothing, like I know nothing, like I am nothing, I'm sick of it! SHE SOBS Hadn't realised, and now it's too late. Their campaign began 20 years ago. More. The slow drip, drip, drip of fear and hate, without anyone willing to counter it. Worse - we stuck the boot in too. How many of us on this side blamed Europe or the outsider when it was politically convenient to do so? And now? Now we're expected in a matter of weeks to begin pushing back that tide. TV: And I will stand on this boat and I'll say you are wrong and you are wrong and you're wrong! Not one of you lot look like you have come out of Southend-on-Sea! So this is what we're reduced to, is it? This is who we are? You brag that you're London through and through. BOB GELDOF: Go back down the river cos you're up one without a canoe! To the dismay of Remain colleagues, Gedolf's signals were somewhat crude. SIMON MCCOY: On that breaking news, reports of a stabbing and shooting involving the MP Jo Cox. Very scant information at this stage. But according to the Press Association, they're quoting an eye witness who says, that the Batley and Spen MP has been shot in the incident. JANE HILL: Details really are scant. Jo Cox is the MP for Batley and Spen. We know that she is involved in some way, and we have been told that she is injured. I'm afraid that really is as much as is coming through at the moment. So some sort of incident... OK. OK. Thanks, thank you. Yeah, bye. Emergency services at the scene. She's co-chair of the Friends Of Syria All-party Parliamentary Group. She was a strong advocate for Britain Stronger in Europe. We're hearing that she was at a nearby library holding a... POLICE COMMISSIONER: Just before one o'clock today, Jo Cox, MP for Batley and Spenborough, was attacked in Market Street, Birstall. I am now very sad to have to report that she has died as a result of her injuries. Before going into further detail, I would like to express our deepest sympathies to her family and friends at this tragic time. Jo was attacked by a man who inflicted serious and, sadly, ultimately fatal injuries. Subsequently there was a further attack on a 77-year-old man nearby, who has sustained injuries that are non-life-threatening. Shortly afterwards, a man was arrested nearby by a local uniformed... BEEPING WHIRRING, SCREECHING Strange week. Yeah. Drink? I didn't think it would be as bad as this. You? No. But, then again, isn't that what these types of questions do? Force people into tribes. Still, I think it should be possible, vital even, for a country to be able to ask itself a question, and to be answered without... ..all this. Without such hate. Without fucking death. Yeah. Seems it's moved... ..way beyond our relationship with an economic bloc. It's... ..it's about the soul of our country. I worry. I worry that we won't be able to heal... ..that this has created... Exposed - we didn't create it. ..a type of debate, a politics that is unsophisticated, uncivilised and, worst of all, unkind. Seriously, though, you...you don't worry about the long-term repercussions of all this? Of undermining the very concept of expertise, of independent authority? Your experts had an agenda. Based on their knowledge. You are feeding a toxic culture, where nobody can trust or believe anything... That is not what I'm doing at all. ..where nobody listens to each other, they just yell. And the loudest and the rudest gets heard... And give people a voice who have been ignored for years. You're not giving them a voice, you're inciting them. Don't confuse me with Banks and Farage, they're the ones who are inciting people. How convenient that you had them to do your dirty work for you. Have you ever, ever REALLY tried to stop them? You and your lot have dominated politics, political discourse, for decades, Craig, and what have you done with it? What? You can't close the box, Dom, once it's been opened. This is the new politics now, the way we will conduct... Change is exciting. What's your edge? What are you doing, what have you found? It's the sleep I miss. I miss sleep. God I do, too, I miss sleep. I honestly think I had more hours a night when my kids were born than this. You're having a baby, aren't you? Yeah. What have you got, two daughters? Three. I think about it, you know? About the kind of country that they'll grow up in. What is this? A "think of the children" appeal? Please, Craig. I am doing. I'm trying to get us ready. The train coming down the tracks isn't the one that you expected, it's not the one advertised on the board? Well, tough. It isn't even the one that I imagined. But I accept it. You can't stop it. You're right, there is a new politics in town. One that you cannot control. Be careful what you wish for. You won't be able to control it either. BELL RINGS Last orders! BIG BEN CHIMES It is decision day. After all the campaigning, the rows and debates, today, it is time for the voters to have their say. Polling stations opened at seven o'clock this morning. More that 46 million people have their chance to vote today. That's a record for this country. I voted to Remain. I don't think there's any good reason to stay in the thing. The referendum is taking place in every part of the United Kingdom. The polls are open until 10 o'clock tonight. And, once they close, it will be at Manchester Town Hall that the final result will be declared by the chair of the Electoral Commission. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. The total number of ballot papers counted was 33,577,342. The total number of votes cast in favour of Remain was 16,141,241. The total number of votes cast in favour of Leave was 17,410,742. ELECTRONIC, UPBEAT VERSION OF RULE BRITANNIA PLAYS MUSIC DISTORTS AND ECHOES You've changed the country forever! DAVID DIMBLEBY: And that's the result of this referendum, which has been preceded by weeks and months of argument and dispute. The British people have spoken, and the answer is we're out. CHEERING AND APPLAUSE If I may... If I may borrow from England's greatest wordsmith. PHONE RINGS From this day to the ending of the world, but we in it shall be remembered. Yeah? Congratulations. I can't believe we did it. It's amazing. ..brothers. Dom, are you there? Yeah. Great. It's great. Look, I just want to say, I know we had our own little wobble. I've gotta go. CHANTING: Dom! Dom! Dom! Dom! Dom! Dom! Dom! Dom! Dom! CHEERING Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech! HE PROTESTS CHEERING What did we say we were going to do? Kill the CBI? We wanted to take back control. What are we doing? ALL: Taking back control. What have we done? ALL: Taken back control! Come on! CHEERING GLASSES CLINK CHEERING CLINKING NIGEL FARAGE ON TV: Honesty, decency and faith in nature I think now is going to win! CHEERING And we will have done it without having to fight and without one single bullet being fired. And we will have done it. Actually, one bullet WAS fired, you moronic, little cunt. And some people are now saying that was wrong. And that the people should never have been asked in this way. I disagree. REPORTERS SHOUT OVER EACH OTHER I believe it was entirely right... ..and inevitable, and indeed, that there is no way of dealing with a question on this scale, except by putting it to the people. In the end, this question is ABOUT the people. It's about the right of the people of this country to settle their own destiny. SOPHIE RAWORTH: Within hours, David Cameron announced he was standing down as Prime Minister. Thank you very much. He said he'd stay in Number Ten for the next few months, but that the country required fresh leadership. HE HUMS A TUNE Right. I can't hear it any more. Can you? It's gone. ELIZABETH DENHAM: Mr Cummings. I said, if you are the unknown soldier in all of this, the real puppet master, and we're all living in the future that you have imagined for us... This isn't my future, this is crap. It's all gone crap. So, you were wrong? Your predictions, your optimism for life outside the EU, it was flawed? This is a... Well, it's going to be a multi-decade project. Multi-decade?! Yeah. I didn't see that on the side of the bus. The vision wasn't flawed... ..it's people that are flawed. The politicians, they did it crap, and they ruined it. I said the entire Downing Street operating system needed overhauling. But you weren't there, were you? You were pushed out, once again. There is a systems failure in this country and across the West. We're languishing, we're drifting without a vision or a purpose. And what do you do usually when there's a systems failure? You reset. And that's all I did. I reset. And what did they do? What did all of you do? You rebooted the same operating system, the same tired, old politics of short-termism, and self-serving, small-thinking bullshit. But are you not part of the same culture, Mr Cummings? No. Of half-truths? Well... Easy answers, false promises? Yes, yes, don't think that I don't know I'm as bad as the rest of them, but that's what the system does, the virus, it infects. But I was hoping, just praying, that someone, anyone, with a minimalist amount of... even a fucking modicum, an ounce of imagination or vision or, Jesus Christ, aspiration, could see that there was the opportunity for something to... ..to actually happen, for someone to step in and do something... ..to make a change to... ..to just... Are you done, Mr Cummings? HE SIGHS Yeah, I'm done. We're all done. Thank you. Subtitles by explosiveskull
