** ** I've never seen anybody with so much luggage. You're yelling at me, Marty! I'm not yelling, I'm have an anxiety attack. There's a difference. I don't understand you. Aren't you thrilled we're getting married next week? Yes, yes-- No. No, that's not it. It's your dad, moving to Europe, working for him, learning the tour bus business. It's a whole new life. Darling, we are a team. We can handle anything. If we put our minds together, we can absolutely conquer Europe. A new job, a new life. Nothing fazes me, really. Thanks, Randi. I really needed to hear that. Let's get this stuff inside. Aah! I broke a nail! Why does everything always happen to me? (humming) Uh, you want to toss me my passport there, buddy? Yeah. Hey, this smells like perfume. Musk. You never know. You get hung up at Customs, a pretty girl is checking you through, she gets a whiff of the passport, touchdown! Zane-o's got every edge, my man. Every edge. You know, I cannot believe you booked the same tour that Sylvia and I are taking on our honeymoon. You won't even know I'm there. I'm the kind of guy that blends into walls. (music playing) Hey! Hey! (scat singing) I'm gonna get some air. Air. (whistling) Hey there. (whistling) Sylvia? (man, French accent) They are circles, but they are oval. I love them so very much. Hi, Leo. Hi. Where are you going? We're getting married in five minutes. Gee, something smells good. It's succulent onion saut√©ed to a golden brown. Want me to whip you up an omelet? Oh, gee, thanks, sure. Leo, there's something I have to tell you. What is it? You want two eggs or three, chief? Three, and make sure they're not runny. Leo, even though we're about to get married, you have to admit things haven't been as good lately as they were in the beginning. Gee, I thought things were going great. Cheese? Swiss. Not for me, Leo. I feel stagnated. I feel smothered in our relationship. What are you trying to say? Pepper and mushroom? Fine, and some spinach, please. You got it. Leo, I've met someone else. Oh, my God. This can't be happening. Leo, I'm sorry. You're a very nice person. Who is it? I've got to know. Here you go, chief. Three eggs, Swiss cheese, peppers, onions, mushrooms, and spinach. I am the best, right, my little eggy-weggy? Enjoy. Sweetheart, you forgot your slippers? Oh, thank you, dear. It's such an exciting job, going on these secret trips. I really envy this one-- London, Paris, Rome, Amsterdam. I'll be back in a week. Promise me you'll be careful. I promise. Oh, I forgot. I packed your lunch for the plane. Uhh. (choking) Uhh. (coughs) Susan? It's Dad! Nothing's wrong. You told me to call you, so I'm calling. (thinking) Now that's a good-looking woman. Nice legs. Nice tush. Uh-huh. Oh, yeah! I'm still here. I was distracted for a moment. No, don't put the kids on! Hi, Jamie! It's Grandpa! Doug Paladini. Ken Johnson. (man) Hirschberger! How bad do you want to go to Europe? I don't even want to go. I want to go to camp. Yeah? Which camp you want to go to? I don't care. I just need to unwind. All right. Here's the deal. You go to camp, I go to Europe. Here. This will get you into Camp Rama. Ask for a counselor named Artie. Tell him Dave the Idea Man sent you. Your I.D. badge and your plane tickets. I don't know how to thank you! Make a wallet for me! ** (no audible dialogue) (no audible dialogue) (shutter clicks) (shutter clicks) (shutter clicks) Daddy! Hi! Randi! Oh, you look sensational as always! Marty, you look terrific. You been lifting weights? Oh, no, sir, just her luggage. Oh, come on with the "sir" stuff. You're gonna be family in a week. Call me Dad. Oh, okay. Uh...Dad. Ah, I like that. Gosh, we've got a lot to catch up on. I can't believe my little girl is getting married. I know. I have a zillion things to do this week. Oh, don't you worry. Your mother's on the case. She's already bought out half of London. All you two have to do is show up next Saturday. Right. 3:00. Oh, by the way, Prince Rainier RSVP'd. He is coming. Good. Prince Rainier? At my wedding? (exhales) May I have a glass of water. Oh! Oh, I'm sorry! Marty! Oh, don't worry about it, son. It's nothing. Darling, why don't we go up to our rooms for a little while? Oh, you go ahead, Randi. I just want a few words with Marty. Guy stuff. Sure. Look at you two. My two men. Toodles. (chuckles) (chuckles nervously) So... What'd did you want to talk to me about...Dad? That's number one. Cut the "Dad" crap. Number two, I don't like you. I sort of feel like we're getting off on the wrong foot, don't you? Quiet. For some reason, Randi insists on marrying beneath her. Well, since it seems you're going to be spending a lot of time in my face, I'm going to give you a chance to win me over. I appreciate you being open to me, sir. Basically, I'm going to offer you a job for which you are immensely under-qualified and will be tremendously overpaid. I don't suppose this is a good time to ask if there's a health plan. You can have this job on one condition. You have to prove your mettle to me. I have a tour driver. His name is Mo Wyshocki. He's been with me for 19 years. Everybody loves him. People ask for his tours specifically, and afterward they write me letters telling me how much fun they had with Mo. You must be very proud of him. I hate him. He costs me money. He dawdles, he makes side trips, and he's a wiseguy. I want you to find me a reason to fire him. But, gee, 19 years. Maybe you two should do lunch, have a confab. Are you questioning me? Because if you don't want this job-- No, no, I do, I do. I was just pitching. Don't. I want you to get something on Wyshocki now, and it better be big. He's in a union, and I don't want to get stuck paying him a pension. Marty, every man has a dark side. I want you to find Mo's and bring me his head on a plate. (man, British accent) 218, please. Mo Wyshocki here on the way to Heathrow Airport to pick up yet another unsuspecting group. Gonna try to top my last tour, but I don't think that's possible. (man) About your expenses in Spain... So? You weren't supposed to be in Spain! They wanted paella. Look, Mo, I can't keep putting these through for you. I know you can hear me. Mo! Mo! (brakes hissing) Oh! Help! (all) Oh! Are you all right? Are you sure? Gosh, I'm sorry. Man, are we gonna have a good time. Look, Swanson, will you just leave me alone? You know, ten hours of "Swanson, leave me alone..." I'm starting to feel rejected. Come on, Future Scientists of America, let's go. Yeah, come on. Fall in, guys. David, I can do it myself! Ira, will you come on? They're waiting for us. Ooh! Look at that! Did you see her? What? Where? What? You missed it. Pay attention, Leo. This is where they invented the mini-skirt. By the way, uh... aren't you just dying to find out how I did with Margo? Who's that? Margo. The stewardess? The one with the mole but otherwise perfect complexion? I guess I didn't notice. Still thinking about Sylvia. Call me crazy, but I always thought I'd go on my honeymoon with my wife. Hey, kemosabe, I'm your best friend. You want to talk about it? That'd be nice, Zane. You see, when Sylvia said she wanted to leave me, I was devastated. I thought things were going great. After all, I'm a respected CPA. He's a short-order cook. Ooh! Check that out. Miss? Excuse me. Miss? This is my first time in England. I'm having a little trouble with the language. All right, this is it, folks. This is it. Tops in Tours. I am your tour guide, Mo Wyshocki. (all) Hi! Hello! Welcome to jolly old England. Uh, how many of you are here for the first time? Let me see a show of hands. Aw! (laughs) I'm only kidding, folks. I'm practically a native. And you will be, too, after your day here. Now, they're gonna load the luggage, so let's everybody get on the bus. We're already 30 seconds behind schedule. So, this is Europe. Europe stinks. Come on. Come on, honey. Bob and Edith Sperling, Youngstown, Ohio. Welcome aboard. I hope you brought lots of film for that camera-- Well, see, now, that's what we wanted to talk to you about. You see, Bob and I, we don't like tours. I don't know how to tell you this, but, uh, this is a tour. This is a tour bus. I'm a tour guide. These are tourists. I hope I didn't just throw you a curve. No, no, no, we know this is a tour. I mean, we use this as a base, and then Bob and I go out on our own to some out-of-the-way spots. Whatever you like, it's your vacation. First stop, Buckingham Palace. I think it is so neat that daddy is training you. I just knew you two were gonna hit it off. Yep. It's gonna be some life. Now, darling, I want you to have a fabulous time. I want you to learn a lot. Don't you dare be late for the wedding. Why would I be late for my own wedding? I don't know. I mean, a good-looking, single American all alone in Europe for a week. Anything could happen. Well, hey, come along. Me? On a bus? Get serious. I gotta go. Cheeks. (sighs) Bye. Mr. Wyshocki! Guilty as charged. Oh, are you with the science kids? Where's your t-shirt? No, I'm Martin Bacon from Tops In Tours. I'm the new vice president of the European operations. Well, pardon me. You're marrying the Duchess of Wainwright? Oh, kid, I want to wish you a lot of luck. Seriously. You're gonna need it. Nice to meet you, Marty. I gotta get on the road. I'm going with you. You are? Yes. I have a letter here from Mr. Wainwright. Oh, yeah? Who wrote it for him? I'm just kidding. Well, welcome aboard. You are gonna have the fun time of your life. I'm not here to have fun. I'm here to observe this particular tour package. And so far, I've observed you violate section 16-A of the Tops in Tours dress code. 16-A? Yes. Where's your cap? It's in the manual. Hey, I don't go by the book. I just wing it. But I'll guarantee you, you get one complaint, I'll buy you a beer. I don't drink. Okay, I'll buy you dinner. You eat, don't you? Hey! Is that a smile I see around those facial features? Come on, kid. Life is short. Loosen up. You're too young to have a stick in your shorts. Martin! (Mo) Now, I know you're all anxious to get to your hotel room and into a nice lukewarm bath, but I thought I'd show you a little bit of London. First, Buckingham Palace and the Changing of the Guard. Thank you. (woman) Oh, isn't that extraordinary! Ooh. All right, you will notice the flag flying on the roof. That means that Her Majesty the Queen is at home. (brass band playing) All right, here it is. This is the biggie. The Changing of the Guard. All right! Thank you, guys. Thank you. Good job. Wow. I wonder what it's like inside. Would you like to see it? All right, let's go. All right, everybody, back on the bus. We're going around to the back of the palace. (woman) What? (murmuring) All right, folks, this is it. Don't forget your cameras. Wait! This-- This is not on the itinerary! No, Ira, you can't go to the bathroom now. This is the Queen's house. Wait for me before you cross the street. (car horn honks) May I? Oh, thank you. (thinking) I wonder if she's single. Now, why did I say that? I'm not a teenager in heat. I'm a 65-year-old widower trying to enjoy Europe in the twilight of my life. It's a lovely day, isn't it? Yes, it is. (thinking) I want her. All right, let's see what we have here. There's the White House, the Louvre, the Vatican... Ah, Buckingham Palace. Do you believe this? How about this guy? Sylvia should see this. Here we go! (chatting) I protest! (tires screeching horns honking) Everybody stop! This is not on the itinerary! You're in trouble, Wyshocki! This is unbelievable. Pretty awesome, ain't it, babe? Bo, where's the Queen's bedroom? It's upstairs. Come on, I'll show you. Now, these busts are priceless. They're over 2,000 years old. (recorder clicks) Selsky. Memo. Day one. We've snuck into Buckingham Palace. Unbelievable. So far, no one suspects anything. I'm keeping a very low profile. (recorder clicks) (crash) Shh. The Queen's bedroom. (cameras clicking) (knocks on door) Who is it? It's me, Your Majesty, Mo. Oh, Mo! How delightful! Do come in! (camera clicks) Could you see? I couldn't see anything. Excuse me, governor. You with Tops in Tours? That depends. Why? That bus is parked illegally, and I'm about to have it towed to the impound garage. Might get very sticky for the owner. Why would you assume that I have anything to do with that bus? You've got five minutes to move the bus, or you're in deep muck. Where's Wyshocki? Upstairs. Where is he? He's in there, with the Queen. You get a chance to watch much TV? Not really, but I do look forward to "Benny Hill." Wyshocki, what the hell do you-- Whoa! Excuse me there, Marty. Your Majesty, Martin Bacon. Martin Bacon, the Queen of England. I think he likes you. Well... we gotta push off. Thanks again for the crumpets, and say hi to Chuck and Di for me. Oh. Tell him he owes me a phone call. See you again. I forgot something. (telephone ringing) Hello? Mr. Dad! You making any progress with Wyshocki? Oh, I was just about to call you on that, sir. For what it's worth, he's a very interesting guy, and the group seems to love him. I've kind of taken a liking to him myself. You know, maybe we should run this one up the flagpole again. Shut up and listen. You get the goods on Wyshocki, or I'll have you washing buses. Say hi to Randi for me. (sighs, moans) (knock on door) Who is it? It's me Mo. You got a minute? I'll make this quick. Look, I know you represent the company. I hope that little side trip today didn't put your nose out of joint. It was highly irregular. But I must admit that the group seemed to enjoy it. Try not to make a habit of it, okay? Fine. Would you feel better if you knew exactly what we were gonna do tomorrow? Yes, I would. As soon as you figure it out, let me know, huh? Don't snap my towel! Look, kid, I'm just trying to loosen you up. I'm loose. I'm loose. Now, if you'll please excuse me, I'd like to dry my hair. My mousse is hardening. Ah! I wouldn't do that if I were you. Look, I appreciate your concern, but I know all about the differences in currents over here. I majored in engineering before I switched to hotel and restaurant management. Okay. I'll see you in the morning. (sizzling) (dog barking) Mr. Callaway! What have you got for me? I think I've located your daughter. Are you serious? Where is she? Is she all right? When can I see her? Whoa! Slow down! I'm 99% sure she's in Paris, but I don't want you to get all worked up. I know you've been down a lot of dead ends these last four years. Five years. Five years, two months and 18 days since the last time I saw her. Well, what do you think we ought to do next? What I think you should do next is pay my bill. $5,000? And 10,000 more when I deliver your daughter, yes. That's all the money I got in the whole world. Really? I always thought bus drivers made a decent buck. Didn't you ever see "The Honeymooners?" If you want the best private eye there is, you gotta pay. I just-- I can't believe that you found her! You are the best! Uhh! We're not home yet! (clears throat) I'll contact you in Paris. Good luck. ** (brakes hissing) Quite a morning, huh, guys? (all) Yeah! Don't applaud. Tell Wainwright to give me a raise. Hey, there's a bistro right over there. Why don't we go give it a shot? Well, how about that? Would you believe I've never been here before? (all talking) Mo! Bonjour, mon cher Mo. Louie, I know it's the custom in your country, but frankly, it makes me nauseous. Oh, Mo, I missed you. Please sit down. Today you are my guests. S'il vous plait. (all talking) (church bell ringing) (thinking) He's not bad, and he's all by himself. I wonder if he's divorced. He smiles a lot. She must be dead. (car horns honking) S'il vous plait. Yvette, wine for everybody. Oui, Papa. Whoa. Get a load of those jugs. Merci. Not bad, is she? Who? Dottie. You've been eyeing her ever since the airport. Is it that obvious? That's okay. She's been eying you, too. I just think you'd better make it snappy, 'cause it looks like Zane's gonna make his move. I'd better get over there. But what should I say? It's been a long time. Just leave it up to uncle Mo. Here's what you say. (whispering) Excuse me. Is this seat taken? (thinking) He's finally making his move. Can I buy you a drink? Of course I must see some I.D. first. (laughs) Sit down. Louis, excuse me. Do you have a pay telephone? Sure, monsieur. Through the door and to the back. Hi. Hi. I thought you might be hungry, so I took it upon myself to bring you some food. That's very thoughtful. What's the catch? There's no catch. Call it a peace offering. I've got some escargot avec shallots, poulet Louie, and for dessert, crepes Kalin flamb√®. You seem to know your French foods. Well, gourmet cooking is kind of a hobby of mine, along with hang gliding, bodysurfing, and working with underprivileged children. (laughs) Okay, I can't lie to you. There is a small catch. How about after lunch, we go for a walk, see some of the city? Just as friends. Well, I am getting a little tired of being a babysitter. I promise I won't try anything. It's okay. I can take care of myself. Okay, why not? But just as friends. That's all I want. I just want to be your friend. Good, because I'm engaged. (tray crashes) You having fun, Marty? I'm working, Mo. I'm doing my report. We're on a break, Marty, relax. Hey, take your shoes off. Dance with me. Mo-- Mo, there is no such thing as a break when you're in management. Being a VP is a full-time proposition, 25 hours a day. Well, at least eat something. Well, I am a little hungry. Thanks. Mmm. That's interesting. What is it? Sheep's brains. Another? Hey, you see the way she looked at me? Who? Yvette, the waitress. She undressed me mentally. I felt violated. It was great. Zane, she was just trying to be nice. Come on. You know you're a real downer. And the one thing you don't know anything about is women. Oh, and I suppose you do, Mr. Musk Oil? I know one thing: You can bet that on my wedding day, my bride's gonna show up without a date. Oh! Okay, fine! Just get it all out, Zane! I'm sorry, Leo, that was a cheap shot. I apologize. Uhh! Leo! Hey, Leo! Uhh! He's as good as we thought he was, maybe even better. Well, he'd definitely be an asset to us. (light crackles) Well, I just have to figure out how to bring him over to our side. Yeah. Darn! (thud) Uhh! (groans) Sorry, Mr. Selsky. (car horn honks) Whoa! What happened to your foot? Hey, what's with the touching? What am I, a hand towel? Sorry. Um, listen, we couldn't help but to overhear your conversation with Leo, and since you're gonna be alone this evening, we were wondering if you'd like to join us. We're going to the world-famous Folies Bergere. You guys are 12. Get away from me. We're almost 14. Oh, well, that's a big difference. Why don't you have a cookie and go home? Okay, look, just sneak us into the show. That's all we ask. You guys can't con me, huh? Take a hike. Did you wire him? Piece of cake. The guy's a walking satellite dish. I don't know about this. Hey, come on. So far, does Europe stink or what? It's the only way we're gonna have any fun. The guy is an animal. Yvette! Yvette! Have we met? It's me, Zane. From the tour group. Oh, oui. Now it rings a bell. You're the one who ate two dozen oysters. Quite a man. (Zane) That's right. Now we're getting closer to international relations. (feedback) Did you know that when you speak there is feedback? Oh! May-- Maybe it's the electricity between us. Uh, listen, Yvette, uh... Listen, I was wondering, since I'm new to this burg, maybe you could show me some of the hot spots. I'm sorry, but papa does not approve of dating Americans. So I won't ask him out. We're leaving tomorrow. Your father will never know. Okay, but we must not meet here. I will meet you in one hour at the bridge on the Avenue Eiffel Tower. Can you give me a landmark so I can find it? (gasps) That's the church we went to visit-- Sainte-Chapelle, with the green-- I mean, the blue, remember? Dottie? Yeah? What a beautiful afternoon for a boat ride. Oh, that's wonderful. I've always wanted to see Paris that way. (thinking) Actually, I wish I knew how to get her up to my hotel room. (thinking) What I really want is to go back to his hotel room. Do you want to go for a ride? Oh, you little devil, you read my mind. Bonjour, monsieur. Bonjour, madam. Two. Two. Un, deux. Yes, sir. Oh, hey, there's Leo Feltch. Aw, he looks kind of lonely. (thinking) I wish he'd get lost, but she'll probably think I'm a jerk if I don't invite him. Over here, Leo! (thinking) Keep walking, Leo. Why don't we ask him to come along? (gasps) I was just thinking the very same thing. Leo! Hi. What's up? Going for a boat ride. Swell! One. Hey, guys! Wait for me! Uhh! Oh! Sister! I'm sorry! Did I break your... bibliosicca? Oh, heavens. ** (indistinct chatter) (Dottie) Oh! That's incredible! David, I never thought I'd say this, but I had a great time today. Me, too. Good. Kalin, are you really engaged? Yes. His name is Arturo Penserello. He lives in Italy. He's an investment banker. How old is this guy? He's 27, and we're very much in love. I can't wait to meet him. Wait a minute. Did I just miss something? You're engaged, and you haven't met this guy yet? Well, we've never met, but we've known each other intimately. We've been pen pals for five years. You should see his letters. They are so beautiful. You want to see his picture? Uh, no. Do I detect a hint of jealousy from my new friend? I'm not jealous. I'm just trying to figure out how this is all gonna work out. I mean, are you going to finish school in Italy, or is he gonna move his investment business to the States? Don't you think he's gonna look kind of stupid at the prom? We're not getting married right away. I'm gonna finish school first, then we'll see what happens. Arturo's not a high-pressure kind of guy. (car horn honks) (footsteps approaching) Yvette. What? Is it my cologne? No, it is my papa! Yvette! Whoa! Whoa! You American gigolo! I'm harmless. War wound. I'm a eunuch. I'll cut you! Listen to this. As we know, several years ago, your wife kidnaps your daughter and disappears. I get a tip that they're somewhere in Europe. (blows raspberry) Here's the interesting part. She starts playing house with a circus performer named The Great Martini. A circus and a guy named after a drink? She would do that. And there's more. Six months later, she decides The Great Martini isn't that great, so she runs off with a contortionist. (laughs) And my daughter? She's still with Martini. He won't let her go, until today, when I, of course, rescued her. Which is good, you know, because they were ready to go off to Belgium. Last performance tonight. Well, where is she? Got the money? Ah. First, my daughter. (footsteps approaching) This is definitely a Kodak moment. Callaway, that's not my daughter. Didn't I send you a picture? Yeah, but she was in high school. People change. You are cute. Thank you. You're pretty... and handsome. Well, I'll let you two get reacquainted. Callaway, can I talk to you just a minute? I was gonna ask you for a letter of recommendation, but maybe now's not a good time. Gotta run, Mo! Sounds like you two have got everything worked out. Yep. That's too bad. You know why? No, why? Because once you're a married woman, you will not be allowed to experience the... knee-buckling, legs-turning-to-Jell-O, "did the Earth just move for you," volcanic David Swanson soul kiss. And it goes something like this. Hyah! Uhh! Whoa! What was that? Aah! Yankee! Yankee! (yelling in French) Uhh! What? Again? Is this the custom? Why, that guy looks just like Zane. I'll get you, Calloway! I'll get you! That's all the money I got in the world! No! No, Calloway! No! Aah! Whoa! Oh! Aah! Save my camera! Selsky! My camera! My film! My wallet! My pictures of Sylvia! I'm sorry, Selsky. We just don't feel safe in the same boat with you. Well, I thought things were going pretty well. ** (man on P.A.) And now, in the front ring, on horseback, it's the Princess Avita! (applause) ("Habanera" playing) (music continues) (mouthing) (music stops, applause) You are so beautiful, Sophie. My heart pounds when I hold you. Of course, I love you too, Trudy... except tonight, you were a very bad girl. If you stray like that again, you're out of the show. She's hungry. Well, let her out. Wow. Stale crackers, moldy cheese and some brown stuff. Is it my birthday? What are you complaining about? You have your own room. Next door, they got 12 midgets and the Lopez chimps in a place half this size. Sounds like the French Riviera to me. Pick, pick, pick. You know, as far as I am concerned, you can leave whenever you like. Catch you later. The girls would like you to stay. Why are you doing this? What kind of sick pleasure do you get out of keeping me here? I want to marry you. But I hate you! I despise you! I think you're a vile, disgusting animal! Yes, but this is just one side of me. I'm really very giving. I would do anything for you! Except shave my mustache. It's my trademark. Martini, please let me go. I swear I won't say a word to anyone, I swear. Even though you've locked me in a room for five years, I won't hold a grudge. Just let me go. I hate when you whine! It's so...whiny. And now, ladies and gentlemen, I direct your attention to our main attraction. The internationally famous, the one, the only, The Great Martini! (cheers and applause) (fanfare) (brass band playing) (drumroll) (cymbal crash) (audience gasps) (audience gasps) (cheers and applause) (drumroll) (audience gasps) (cheers and applause) (brass band playing) Oh, I'm gonna get that guy. (growls) (elephant growls) (elephant growls) (coughing and tapping) (coughing) Mo! Ha! What are you doing here? What a pleasant surprise. Ha ha. I don't believe this. You're tailing me. Is that what you think? I'm offended. What are you doing in there? Discovering Paris. You see, when some people visit a new city, they like to go to the museums or to the theater or to the bars. I like to go through garbage. I'm a garbalogist. Well, a bientot. I want to know why you are following me. I have nothing further to say. Uhh! It was Wainwright! Uhh! All right, Marty! The truth, Marty, all of it! Wainwright sent me on this trip to follow you. He wanted me to get something on you so he could fire you. Well, what's in it for you? Not that much. VP job, stock options, company car, two months paid vacation, expense account. Penny-ante stuff. Did he tell you why he wanted to fire me? Well, he said you were a wiseguy, and you cost too much. And you agreed? Well, it did seem a bit cold, but he's the boss, and someday I'd like his office. (sighs) I heard about your daughter, Mo. I'm sorry. You know, maybe I can help save your job. I can give Wainwright a call and put in a good word for you. Hell, we're practically family. Forget it. Well, I wish there was something I could do to help. Something small but meaningful... within company policy, of course. You want to help me? Then let's follow this circus to Belgium and get my daughter away from that maniac. "Maniac" is where you lose me, Mo. Let's just stick to the itinerary. Tomorrow it's The Hague and a cheese factory. Marty, I gotta save my daughter. What a mess, Mo. It's like a tangled web. All right, let me untangle it for you. Look, I promise you I'll get you back in time for your wedding, guaranteed. Now, listen, when we get there, I'll confess to anything you want me to, and you can fire me right on the spot. You'll be a hero. Just go along with anything I say until we can get my daughter back from that Martini. Deal? ** (chatting) Hi. Well, if it isn't Hulk Hogan. David, I came over here to apologize. It was instinct. I have a black belt in karate. No. Hey, I deserved it. I want to propose a truce. You're gonna flip me. David. Hey, Zane. I waited for you. Big mistake, Leo, because I had a date. Oh, really? How'd it go? How'd it go? You know that famous song "Who Wrote The Book Of Love"? Yeah, so? Zane-o "The Stud" Drinkwater, that's who. That's funny, 'cause, come to think of it, I thought I saw you this afternoon running down the street. Me? Ha. No way. I was romantically involved with a lovely woman of French distraction. Are you sure? I mean, I took a boat ride with Ed and Dottie, and I saw this guy running down the street for his life. You are sadly mistaken. Leo, you have confused someone with me, the Zane-o Love Machine. (Leo) You know, come to think of it-- (Zane, on P.A.) Whoa! Whoa! You've got the wrong idea! I'm harmless! War wound! I'm a eunuch! (laughing) Hey, you! You! Fat boy! Come here! Kiss off! You stink! I'm gonna get you! Come on, Zane! Come on! I want to thank you all for coming down on such short notice. I realize it's late, but I appreciate it. Is everybody here? Everybody but Dottie, Ed, and the Sperlings. Dottie didn't answer, Ed had a "Do Not Disturb" sign on his door, and the Sperlings went to Balzac's house. "Do Not Disturb," huh? That's nice. I got to tell you a story. About five years ago, my ex-wife Quasimodo Wyshocki wanted to do something about our lousy marriage, so she decided to kidnap my daughter. Poof! They disappeared off the face of the earth... until yesterday. I found out that my ex-wife is still missing, thank God, but that my daughter is being held prisoner by a lunatic knife-thrower for the Hyman Brothers circus, and I want to get her back. That means a change of itinerary. Tomorrow we head for Rome, and then on Tuesday, we go to Belgium and get my daughter back. (cheering) You guys don't have to go along if you don't want to. There's another Tops in Tours bus coming through here tomorrow. You could hook up with that. (all) No! Well, I don't know what to say except "thank you." All right, let's hit the sack. We leave tomorrow right after lunch. (indistinct chatter) Thanks, Mo. No, no tipping. Buy me a cappuccino in Rome. (knock on door) I'll be right there, Mo. I just gotta pack my Tommy gun, my bazooka, and my brass knuckles. Ha ha ha! (gasps) Randi! What a delightful surprise. Won't you come in? What was that about a bazooka? Oh, that. Ha ha. Just kidding. I like to keep everybody loose. Ooh, I missed you so much. Marty! You're smudging my makeup! Sorry. So, what brings you to Paris? Oh, there are just a thousand things to do that mother and daddy hadn't thought of. The shops in London are nothing. I thought maybe you and I could take a couple of hours now and run up daddy's charge plates. I can't leave the tour for two hours. I'm working. A vice president can do anything he wants. So how's the Mo thing going, by the way? Daddy told me all about it. Oh, great, great. He's hanging by a thread. I knew you could do it. Daddy had some doubts, but I never did. So get ready. We have lunch reservations at Maxim's. I've got to think of something to tell the tour group. Just tell them to buy postcards or film, whatever they do. Right. Great. I'll handle it. You stay right here. I'll be right back. Why are you taking your luggage? Oh, that. Right. Just habit. I won't be needing that. Maybe just my case. (kisses) (door closes) Monsieur. Monsieur. Monsieur. There is a young woman in room 412 waiting for me, but I have to go. Please give her my apologies and see to it that she gets anything she wants. Don't ask any questions. Just give it to her. Oui. Oui? Okay. Merci. For your trouble. What happened to the smile? You won't believe what I just did, Mo. My fianc√®e came to visit me in Paris, and I ran out on her. I left her sitting alone in a hotel room. What kind of a human being am I? I know that's a tough call for you, but... hey, I need you, Rambo. All right, we're moving. ** (knock on door) Come in. (doorknob turning) How about a little appetizer before lunch? Take your clothes off, you sex maniac. (Randi) Aah! ** All right, everybody, welcome to Rome, the carbohydrate capital of the world. Enjoy yourselves, but just remember, be on the bus at 7:00 a.m. sharp in the morning for our little jaunt to Belgium. Buonanotte, circus fans. Buonanotte, Roma! Grazie. Prego. That is right, isn't it? "Prego," something like that? David! I think Kalin dropped this. Would you make sure she gets it? Sure, Mo. Thank you. Hmm. (church bells tolling) "Arturo Penserello." (knocks on door) (speaking Italian) I probably have the wrong apartment, but you wouldn't happen to be Arturo Penserello? Why? Are you my new parole officer? (speaking Italian) They get younger ever time I get out, eh? Um, you wouldn't happen to know a Kalin Brewster? I never heard of her. You were pen pals. You wrote letters to her. I write a lot of letters when I was on Devil's Island. How can you not remember her? You proposed to her. You made a date with her for tonight. Shh! Shut up! (speaking Italian) You want my old lady to hear? Look, if you go anywhere near her tonight, I'll call the cops, and you'll rot in jail. Okay, okay. I won't show up. It's no big deal, eh? (chuckles) I just wanted to have a good time, huh? All right. Well, well, good. But you know what? I'm going to have a good time anyway. But you've got to help me, eh? How? I've had a good time. How about you? (door closes) David, what happened? Oh. Um... I cut myself shaving. Actually, Kalin, the reason I'm here is to tell you that Arturo won't be able to make it tonight. I know. I figured I'd better check him out. I went by his house. Even met his wife. I'm sorry about all this. You must be disappointed. You're a good friend, David. So, since we're both here, up for a little dinner? First, a toast To good friends. To good friends. And maybe more. (Mo) David, how are those phony I.D.s coming? Wow. That's nice work. Dottie, Ed, remember, you have to delay Martini and his stooges for as long as you can. Brian, Ira, you got your tools? Okay. We're all set. Yeah, that's Martini's trailer. And it's got bars on all the windows. Okay, everybody got your assignments? (all) Yeah. Good luck. Hey, what about me? (man) There are two guys up here from television show. They want to interview you. How do you do, Mr. Martini? It is indeed a pleasure. I'm Maurice Chafeman from the 11:00 news. I would love to do a profile on you on tonight's news. It's about time. How great do I have to be before I am noticed? We agree. That's why we want to introduce the greatest circus performer in the world to all of Belgium. Let's say we go to the center ring right now and get some shots of you in action. Sounds delicious! And may I say with all humility, the praise you heap on me, absolutely true! Let's, uh, make magic. Just a minute. Before we make magic, I must see some documentation. The Great Martini must protect himself from fakes. Otherwise, you'd be a fool. Ah. Very well. Gentlemen, to the center ring! Mr. Chafeman, my cape! Yes, sir, Your Excellency. The hat. No. Wear the hat. No. The hat. No! (sighs) Yes, Father? Good day. My name is Father Wyshocki. I happened to bring a group of orphans to the matinee yesterday, and I was shocked to see Hana, my long-lost sister, as the assistant to The Great Martini. I was wondering if I may say hello to her for just a moment. Oh, she's not here. You're lying to a priest? You want to burn in hell? Actually, Father, my associate forgot that Miss Hana is in the back room. You know, sometimes we get confused with all this space. I promise I'll just pay my respects and be on my way. We were never really that close. Come in, Father. (clears throat) Hana, my sister. How good it is to see you again. (whispering) I'm not really a priest, and I'm not really your brother. My name is Marty Bacon, and I work for your father. Jump out of the bathroom window at 11:15. You look wonderful. This job seems to agree with you. Yes. Um... I'm very happy working with The Great Martini. Well, I'd love to stay and schmooze, but I'm calling bingo tonight. It was great seeing you again, Hana. Likewise. Good-bye, brother. Bless you, my child. (barking) (applause) ** (drops knife) Be careful! That's Sophie! You seem very jumpy tonight. What's the matter with you? Nothing. It just slipped. You know how temperamental she can be. (whimpering) And now, ladies and gentlemen, the one, the only, The Great Martini! (drumroll) (fanfare) (cheers and applause) (cheers and applause) (grunts) I think I got it. (exhales) (crowd) Ooh! (saw whirring) (whirring) (crowd gasps) (fanfare) (brass band playing) Hand me the flashlight. I thought you were bringing the flashlight. I brought the fried chicken. I thought you told me to bring the fried chicken. Great. We have 40 buckets of chicken and no flashlight. Did you bring the coleslaw? I thought you were bringing the coleslaw. Just get me a light, will you? (Mo) Come on, guys, hurry up. (brass band playing) Stop! Tonight was the first time ever they did not ask Martini for a curtain call. The first time ever! You want to know why? Because you stunk! Where was your head tonight? I'm sorry. I was off. I guarantee I'll be better tomorrow. You'd better be. And you'd better start falling in love with me soon, or we're going to have a lousy marriage. You know, I feel dirty. I think I need a bath. How you doing? Just the VCR, then we're done. Unplug me and I'm out of here. Okay. (engine starting) Ooh! You were terrific! How do you do that with these knives? I cut myself buttering toast. Oh, could we get an autograph and a photograph? Okay. Thank you. Let's go. Uh, could I get them, too? You want them? Fine. Just hurry up. Oh, boy. If you ask me, he and that girl are nothing. You two guys are the whole show. Thank you very much. Now those are schmoes. Fellas! Could you give me a push? Sure, sure. Hey. We don't like clowns. Come on, guys. Can't you help us? What will you give us? I'll give you something you won't forget. I want my sugar now. You've got it. Hyah! Hyah! Ugh. You have been soaking in that bath for 20 minutes. You're going to shrivel up like a prune. I'll be right out. I'm just fixing my hair. You spend almost as much time in front of that mirror as I do. Where is my lamp? (click) (Leo) I'm delighted to be here today with The Great Martini. I'm sure you are. Forgive me if I get long-winded, but we are talking about my favorite subject: me. Nobody's here. Not her, not the geniuses. (Leo) When did you realize that you were very good with knives? (Martini) Ah. I was about 8 years old, and I was cleaning a fish. And I don't know-- The sun bounced off the bucket and hit the knife blade, and I knew right then that I had a calling. Hana, quick! They're doing the early years! (Martini) In fact, that's what I used to call me-- I'll be right there! But somehow "Amazing" seemed like an understatement. (Leo) What did your parents think of your newly-chosen field? I have hopes of owning my own circus. Someday I would like to have a line of cutlery. Eventually, of course, I would love to direct. Marty, thank you! What are you doing for the rest of your life? (engine sputtering) Why are we stopping? Uh, a little unforeseen engine trouble. As you get to know me, you'll find that I'm really at my worst at these situations. Ira! I'll take a look. They should have been here by now. Something's wrong. My father wanted me to be a lawyer, but I told him I was too much of a cut-up. Hmm. Do you know what's amazing? I'm even better-looking on television. (Leo) It's very funny, too. It really is. Ha ha ha! How did you go about... I don't feel like talking to myself. Hana? (knocks on door) Hana! She's gone. Uhh! I'll kill myself. No. That's a waste. I'll kill her! How are you guys doing back there? We're gonna have to splice the wire. We need something long and sharp. Martini! Run! Get Mo! Get Mo! How could you do this to me? I gave you everything but billing! (cheering) Good work, Hana. I think we lost him. Ah! In the tent! She got away! You want us to help you find her? No. Relax. Take in the show. Get in there! Go! Go! ** (laughter and applause) (cheering stops) Strap them to the board. We'll give this audience a show they will never forget. (coughing) Mo. Where are they? What happened? The car broke down. Martini. (engine revving) Do you realize I'm the only one that didn't get an assignment? I mean, I'm as good as anybody else. Look, I don't mean to chew your ear off. But it really does tick a guy off, you know what I mean? (drumroll) Normally I wouldn't mind, but-- Aah! Aah! Uhh! I'm Hana's father. Not the face. Uhh! (cheering) ** Hey, Mr. Selsky, that took a lot of guts. Thanks. What'd I do? (engine revving) (cheering) Okay, everybody, on the bus. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go Mo! Marty, you were incredible. That was so brave. (chuckles) What can I say? Say that you'll see me again. Oh. Come on, you two, shake a leg. We've got to get Marty to Bordeaux... for his wedding. (Mo) All right, everybody, we're stopping for lunch, and we're in a big hurry, so don't order souffl√©. Look, I know this is going to come as quite a shock to you, but, um, about the wedding. Are we locked into this date, you know, this afternoon? Look-- Look, at least be open. Let's talk about it. I mean, that's the key: communication. You know, sometimes I feel like we don't even talk to each other. Hello? (chuckles) I just wanted to say good-bye. You're leaving? Yeah. I'm gonna go straight to London and crash at my dad's apartment. Oh. Yeah. Well, I suppose you could use a little R and R. Ha. Sure could. Look, uh, Hanna, um, about that little wedding thing. I know I'm supposed to get married this afternoon, but I-- But what? You're still gonna see other people? Oh, no, no, of course not. I... I just never expected any of this to happen. My whole life has been programmed since I was nine years old. I always knew I'd be a businessman and grow up and marry someone like Randi. And then I met you, and my whole life got screwed up. No, I mean that in a good way. All I'm asking for is a little time. Marty, I just wasted the last five years of my life. Time is very precious to me. I can't afford to waste it. I'm really sorry. Mind some company? No, suit yourself. (sighs) You did pretty good with Martini. I was proud of you. You did all right yourself. Yeah. I guess when we want to be, we can be a pretty good team. Sure. Leo, I've been thinking about something. I've been a rotten friend. You were hurting, and you turned to me, and I wasn't there. I was so busy trying to have a good time. Would you give me a chance to start over? Oh, for heaven's sake. Sure. Of course. Leo, how you feeling? To tell you the truth, I'm feeling pretty good. As a matter of fact, I was sitting here thinking about asking that woman out. The one over there by the window. Or maybe the one right over there. Or maybe even one of the waitresses, huh? Ha ha. Which one? The blonde or the brunette? The blonde. She's married with two kids. You're better off with the brunette. She's got a boyfriend, but he's in the navy, and he shipped out today. She also has a butterfly tattoo on her upper thigh. Zane, you truly are Mr. Stud, you know? Yeah, but now I got competition. That's right. (laughs) (woman) I know, Omar. You use a whisk. You've told me 10,000 times. (Omar) You don't understand... Hey, did you hear that? What? That voice. It can't be. (Omar) Extra-large or jumbo. (woman) Can't you talk about anything else but eggs? Why? Eggs are my life. Okay, okay. Now, let's go over the filling. I don't want to go over the filling. I don't care about the filling. You can fill it with garbage for all I care. Look, Omar, I don't know what came over me a week ago. I must have lost my mind or something. But it's back now, and I'm afraid I have to be going. Good-bye, Omar. I'm sorry. (Omar) We never even talked sunny side up! Whoa. That was beyond spooky. You can stop her, you know. You can patch everything up the way it was, right now. I know. Well? Did you happen to catch the name of the waitress? (bell ringing) What are you writing there, Marty? My report to Wainwright. I'm listing your infractions. Wow. I guess it was quite a trip. I'm still in London. I gotta hand it to you, Marty. You are the ultimate company man. After all we've been through, the only thing on your mind is your job. Hardly. (sighs) I've got something else on my mind, Mo, and you're not gonna like it, because it's Hana. I think about her every minute I'm awake. What about your wedding that takes place in about three hours? See, that is the conflict. In other words, you're confused. Totally. You see, on the one hand, there's Hana, the most special person I've ever met. And on the other hand? Well, I marry Randi, work for Wainwright, I'm fabulously wealthy, and for the rest of my life, I eat poo. Well, you do seem to have a grasp on the situation. Well, Mo, your specialty is helping people. What should I do? This is something you're gonna have to work out by yourself. However, I, uh... maybe could give you a couple of visual aids. Uh, this money will represent Randi and your guaranteed financial future. Now, what should we have for-- Oh. How about a picture of Hana? Now, we're talking about your future here, son, so don't rush. Take a couple minutes. Just be sure and give me one of those back. ** (thinking) Oh! Oh, Hana! Oh, you look so lovely. Where have I seen that dress? The drapes? How clever! Uhh! Randi! Coming Randi! Oh! Yes! Yes, sir! Yes, sir! Coming, sir! I'll do anything you want! I'll be anything you want! I'm here to please! Yes, just don't yell! Don't yell! Just don't yell! Stop the bus. I said stop the bus! I said stop the bus. I'll take it from here. (brakes hissing) You got it. I don't want the hat. I don't want the hat. You drive my bus, you wear the hat. (sighs) ** ("The Blue Danube" playing) Hi. 3:00. I knew it. He's late. Daddy, I already talked to him. I straightened the whole thing out. He's gonna be here any minute. He'd better be, and he'd better have Mo Wyshocki's head on a plate. Can't we talk about business after the wedding? No, because if he hasn't done what I told him, there's not gonna be any wedding. Daddy, you're making me really nervous! You're nervous? Do you realize what this thing costs? $2,5000 a plate. And look at Rainier wolfing down the hors d'oeuvres there. What is he, hollow? Hey! Save some for the other 3,000 guests! * Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily * * Life is but a dream * (singing continues) * Row, row, row your boat * * Gently down the stream * * Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily * Mo? Yeah, Marty. The gas pedal's stuck. Well, it does that every once in a while It'll pop back up again. The last time it popped up was two hours ago in Antwerp. Well, hit your brake. They've been dead since Flanders. (Mo) Uh-huh. (hissing) (tires screech) Anybody know The Lord's Prayer? (horn honking) Daddy. I think I hear the bus. ("The Blue Danube" playing) "Here Comes the Bride." Hit it, boys. (playing "Here Comes the Bride" (horn honking) (horn honking) (honking continues) What the hell's he doing? (indistinct murmuring) (gasps) Aah! Aaaggghh! Uhh! Uhh! (horn blaring) (strings playing) Aah! Uhh! (man) Everybody all right in there? (all talking) You have ruined everything! This is so humiliating! You stupid clown! Look what you've done! You better have the goods on Wyshocki. I've got them all right here. 116 pages of infractions, single-spaced. Fine. I knew you could do it, son! Let me have it. What are you doing? (cheering) This is one of the worst days of my entire life! And I'm sorry, Randi, but I just can't see marrying someone who won't kiss on the lips. (crying) I wish I were dead! (crying) Don't cry, my fluffy one. I made you my special sad omelet with blue cheese. Here. That is delicious. I have never tasted anything like that in my life. The secret is in... how you whip your eggs, eh? I'd like to learn a little more about that. What did you say your name was? Omar. Omar Gregorich, hmm? In case anybody's interested, I quit! (cheering) Thanks, Mo, for all your help. Oh, by the way, here's your money back. Oh. Uh... I'd also like to have the picture back, too. Oh, I'm sorry. You're too late. I'm gonna have it blown up into a poster. (Mo) Last stop. Last stop. (all talking) Good luck to you, guys. Hey, study hard. All right, bye-bye. Bye. Oh, Leo! Leo! Tell my mother to send me some money. And don't forget, more clothes. Thanks. (chatting, indistinct) Bye! Bye! What are you guys doing here? You're gonna miss your plane. We're not going. You're not-- No, we're getting married, and we're gonna backpack all over Europe. Well, I wish you a lot of luck. I really mean it. Yeah, me, too. We don't need luck. We've got each other. You two are the ones who need luck. (all talking) Bye, Mo. Have a great time. Okay. Hi! (laughs) My goodness! Did you miss us? Well, yeah, but we have been kind of busy. Yeah. Well, that's too bad, 'cause you missed the good stuff. Well, listen, if you're ever in Youngstown, Ohio, you give us a ring, and we'll give you a grand tour. Bye-bye now! Bye-bye! I sure will. We'll see you. Thank you a lot. Bye. Are you really gonna do that? Are you kidding? Bye! (laughs) Bye! (laughs) What's funny, the way I stir my coffee? No, no, I was just thinking about my predicament. I don't have a pot to plant my potatoes in, but I've never felt happier in all my life. It's senility, Marty, or maybe you bumped your head in the crash. Anyway, I always say just when things get the bleakest, something good is always gonna happen. Except now. Selsky. Get everything sharp and hot off the table. Hello, gentlemen. How you doing? Mr. Selsky, what are you still doing here? Well, I have something to confess to both of you, and I have to do it quickly before my plane leaves. First of all, my name is not Andrew Selsky. It's Larry Lipsky. Of the Lipsky Tours? The very same. My brother and I run the operation. I came on this tour because of you, Mo. I heard you were the best, and I wanted to see how you do it. After one day, I was so impressed, I convinced my brother we had to have you. Now, we're branching out into the States, and we want you to be our number one driver and tour guide. Well, that's very flattering, Mr. Lipsky, but I'm afraid I'm gonna have to decline. You see, Marty and I have decided to throw in with each other. We are? Yeah. We're gonna buy a small van and start our own company. Well, of course, this offer is extended to both of you. Oh, well, I don't know. That's something we'd have to talk about. We'll take it, partner. Welcome aboard. We'll be in touch. Mr. Selsky-- Lipsky, um... all that tripping and falling... Just an act. Part of my cover. I used it to keep you off my scent. Well, I'll call you from New York. What a surprise, huh? Yeah. It's great. You know, he almost ruined my surprise, but not quite. Hi, Marty. ** **
