I asked you for your guidance. I asked you for your love and comfort, I am here as your child asking you for mercey. Shine on my path. Shine on this day. I continued to humble myself and and asked you to shine on those times that I’ve been toxic. Shine on those times that I’ve been toxic. Shine on those times that I’ve been toxic. I am a new man. In Jesus name. Amen. [door opens] [door closing] Hello? You're a murderer Jeffrey who takes lives. You don't create them. How did I get here? I don't remember walking in here. You go and fuck my best friend Billy and start your whole new life. And I have nothing. Still blaming everyone else for your own shit. I get what I like. And I like your wife. Going to do something about it, Jeffrey? I am the one who is responsible for your wife's adultery. [laughing] I'm married to a man that makes me happier than you ever could. You're going to do something about a little bird? A kiss that I love dearly. I don't want to someone like you around my kids. I ended all those lives to keep me. To be true to who I am. You took everything from me. [laying down] Your mind is glitching. Your mind is glitching. Your mind is glitching. [apple bite] [chewing] [apple bite] [chewing] Hey, Ricardo. Didn't you say you were going to be here at three? I'm here. No, I'm not paying extra because your system no show. What? No, that's kinda disrescpectful. Okay. All right. Well, I'll see you at three. Okay. Bye. Jeffrey? Jeffrey? What are you doing here? How'd you get in? The door was open. But you're not supposed to be here. Jeffrey. You're not supposed to be here. I came to see you. Okay. I'll call the cops to get you out of here. Come on. Are you okay? You kinda look like you haven't eaten for a while. I haven’t. Okay. Stay here for. I'll be right back. [walking away] [door opening] [door closing] Here you go. It’s your favorite popcorn. [eating sound] Why are you really here? I just came to see how things were. Are things the way you expected? Not exactly how I remember it, but. It’s okay. It’s okay. Did you expect to see me here? [eating sound] What? How did you expect to see me here when I don't live here? Because this is our house. No, Jeffrey, this was our house. It’s not anymore. Because you left and you took everything. So I had to start over. I took everything? Yeah. You're the one who decided to start your new life with my best friend Billy. What was I suppose to do there? Sit here and let my wife get her back blown up by another man? Okay. You don't have to be so vulgar. You took everything from me. No. I did not do that. This state did that. No, you took my money, my career, my house, my money, my car. I live on the streets now. Okay. Guess we weren’t a good match then. You were always too controlling, Jeffrey. I felt like I couldn't breathe around you. I'm sorry. It's hard to hear. You know what? It's the truth. And I think that if you if you learn from this, if you move on, the next person that you'll end up with will definitely benefit from a changed you. Do you think somebody would want me? I don’t know. Look at me, Penelope. I'm homeless. I haven’t taken a shower in weeks. I'm ugly. I'm dirty. No, you're not ugly and dirty. You could definitely clean up a little bit, but hey, I married a handsome man, and now he's he’s still you. Okay. What about you? Are you happy? Yeah, I am. I am happy with Billy. And my two kids and a dog. You don't even like dogs. How do you know? All right. Well, it was good seeing you, Jeffrey. Uh, should I walk you out? Penelope? Mm? I'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything. Why are you just now saying I’m sorry? Because I'm I'm alone and I don't have anything. And I never thought It would feel like this. You know, and I wish. I wish to God I could fix it. Me too. You need to see a therapist or something. Because this is pathetic. How am I supposed to get help when I have nothing to get to help with? Find a solution, Jeffrey. There's always a solution. That's easy for you to say when you're at the top of a hill. Okay. It's not always easy. Thank you very much. You just have to find. Think. Think of something. Come. What are you thinking? I'm wondering why you don't ever think about me. Do you ever think about me? I mean I do, sometimes. Like when I have to sing one of the songs we wrote together. If I see something that remind me of you. Why? Do you think about me? It's hard to think about anything with all this goddamn gardening going on outside. [laughing] Okay. But yeah. I think about you all the time. I think about us. I think about the past. I think about us before I got so evil. Before got so dark. And whose fault is it getting so dark? Why do you think I'm living ike this? I don't know. You think I like living like this? I'm living like this because of you. Because of the divorce. You let it ruin me. Okay, this is what we're doing? Yea, this is exactly what we're doing. You go and fuck my best friend Billy and start your whole new life. And you leave me with nothing. You forgot the man that you loved, that you said you loved. Now I'm not even a shell of the man I used to be. Okay. Still haven't changed much. I see. Still blaming everyone else for your own shit. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I haven't changed much, but I guess you did. You changed a lot, Penelope. Into this cold hearted, rotten bitch. My heart is as cold as the ocean flor. Can you not look at me like that? You know it's true. You know. I never asked you something I always wanted to ask you. So. Now seems like a good time. Okay? Why are you the way you are? What? Like cold. Hearthless. Like Like a deserted radiation nuclear facility in the coldest parts of Russia in the winter. Why? What, something happened to you as a kid? You saw something growing up to traumatize you, what happened? Do you really want to know? Yeah. Kind of. It's kind of hard for the soul to listen to. I want, I really want to know. Okay. Well. When I was a child. I was touched by M ultiple men in my family. My parents both knew. And I thought that they would just let it go on forever. Until one day they died, both of them in a car crash. So, it was just my sister and I left and. We were very close. We were best friends. Well, we were both, we were both touched by these males. And then one day, my sister died of cancer. So it's just me. It's just me alone. And I think after that probably just shut off, I guess. I mean the touching, I don't, I don't care anymore. I didn't feel anything. And I didn't feel happy. Basically, I didn't feel any emotion. But of course you remember. Cause you never really make me happy and satisfied me. Do you remember when we first met? Really? Do you remember? Of course. I was burying a man alive. And you pretended to think it was fake. And instead of leaving, you stood there and you took pictures. You are sick and twisted, Penelope. No. You get off on the pain of others. No, I don't get all on it. I just fascinated is all. I’m seriously. I'm fascinated when a man like you can act like a zoo animal. You're a monster. Oh. And what does that make you? Because I was young and stupid, but I'm more mature now. Are you? Yes. I think you're still the same rotten Penelope that you were as a little girl. I was rotten because I wanted to see a man bury another man alive? Yes. See, some bad habits die hard. And some bad habits don't die until we die with them. [laughing] You sound like a crazy homeless person right now. Why are you here? Because I have to renovate the property. I'm going to sell it. Why? Because I need the money. Bullshit. You took all my money. You don't need any more money. Why are you really here? I came here for closure. Okay? You came here for closure? You mean to hide your secrets? Is that so bad? Yes. That just means you can't handle the truth. And what is the truth? The truth is, we're both fucked up people were damaged past. We are both fucked up people? Yeah. Okay. Interesting timing in saying that. I want to know what happened to you. What made you into this, Jeffrey, that you are? That kills other people. Mm? I don't know. No, you do know. You're just been denying it for so long. Tell me Jefrey. Tell me, what led you to be this man? Uh. When I was a little kid, like a teenager. I went to this, um, to this camp for three summers, and they made me do, uh, they made me do some bad stuff. What bad stuff? Like killing type stuff. No, more specific. Am I went to this camp and they had these people in boxes. I couldn't really speak English or whatever language they were speaking. Uh. The camp counselors gave us machetes and bone saws and told us to cut them up. I used to use to start with their heads because I felt that that would be more humane. So it gets it gets worse. And they would. They would make us touch the dead bodies and take pictures with them. And then they said that if we said anything, they would kill our parents, just like those people in the boxes. Did you ever tell anyone? I'm telling you now. Besides, no one needs to know what's saved up in here. You know, that’s why I think. You know, that's why I think we belong together, because we grew up the same. We have similar upbringings. Okay, that's where you were very wrong. What do you mean? We're not similar. You don't think so? Jeff? I'm married to a man. That makes me happier than you ever could. I have kids that I love dearly. I don't want someone like you around my kids. So it's the kids, is it? Yes. You're just hiding behind them. No, no, you just. You're just using them to hide behind them. And sooner or later, you'll come out and be rotten Penelope, again. Have you ever killed anyone? What? No. You know, I guess we all don't have it in us Have you ever killed anyone? How could you just ask me that when I just told you about how I. No, no, I meant while we were married. Yeah. How many? Eight or nine. I don't. I don't know. I lost count. Why didn't you tell me? Because I was afraid. You get upset, you look at me different. So you ended all those lives to keep me? No. No. I ended all those lives to keep me. To be true to who I am. [laughing] Do you know how absurd that sounds? Well, yeah. Yeah, it's absurd because we are awful human beings. Unbelievable. Because I'm a murderer as fuck. I think I knew, though. Deep down. You leaving late. Coming home late. Not showering and so you could see me. I can't help the way that I am. How do you feel right now? Uh, the popcorn was good. Other than that, um. I don't know. [door knocking] What time is it? Oh, shoot. It's already three. I'll go to the back. No, no, no, no. Stay here. Are you sure? Yea. Stay here. Okay. Oh. Hi. Hi. Hi. I'm so sorry I got held up earlier. No, no. That’s fine. That’s fine. I have a lot of work to do today. Um. Can you just come back tomorrow? I need to be paid today. Can you just wait? I am kinda busy at the moment. No. I need the money now to pay my workers. Okay. Okay. I'll get my check. Just hold on for a sec. Yeah. Ricardo. Here you go. Thank you. Thank you. See you tomorrow. Okay. Have a great day. [door closing] [door lock] Why do you look so bothered? Because he almost saw me. And? Were going to do something to him? Yeah. With this. You were going to hit Ricardo with a pole? I was going to bash his fuckin brains in. Why? Because Because of what? I wanted to make sure he doesn't see them all. I don't want his kids to see him anymore. I want to make him dead. I wanted to end him. Hmm. [the sound of waves] What's wrong with me? It's like I'm stuck in this darkness. You're not stuck in the darkness. You are the darkness. No, I'm not. Yes, you are. You killed me. You killed all those people. You're a monster. I'm not a monster. I'm just. Lost. You're lost because you chose to be. You could have been happy, Jeffrey. But no. You chose this life. Darkness. Solitude. Why is that pole over there? You were going to use it to hit me with it, weren't you? No, no. I would never hurt you. But you already did. You took everything from me. Wait. How did I get here? I don't remember walking in here. And why are you sitting on the bed like that? I don't know. I’m just so lost and alone. Like you. But you're not alone, though. You're not a real man, Jeffrey. You have a pole in your bias, a killing instrument. That paul probably belongs in this house. It was probably a piece of the plumbing. Mhm. It's important. It's a small part of a whole. A small part of the whole. Which means of what? This house? A family? Us? And what have you done? What could you have possibly done to deserve this life you're living? Dirty. Alone. On the streets. Wait. Are you? What? Are you amused? Yes. Why are you upset? I don't know. I just can't seem to. We don't exist anymore, Jeffrey. But you loved me? [laughing] I never loved you. I was too busy loving others. Well, I was carefully observing you. Watching others. And that's why I ruined you, Jeffrey. Because you. Taught me how to be a ruiner. You understand that? Yeah. But, um. Why are you? Why are you saying all this? Why? Why are you talking to me this way? Because I want. I want. What's happening? He's coming for you, Jeffrey. Who? You know who. Your tormentor. The one that's been following you your whole life. The one that's been fucking you. [laughing] Shit. Baby. Penelope, please put that down. All I need to do is just stick the screwdriver down my throat to make you go away. What's wrong? Talk to me. Let me help you. Get away from me. Well, you can talk to me about anything. I don't want or need your help Jeffrey. You can’t help yourself. Go. Go right now. Go, please. Jeffrey, please go. Alright. Closer. Closer. Closer. Closer. Closer. Closer. Closer. [laughing] [laughing] Oh my God. Jeffrey. Are you okay? Yeah. What just happened? Uh. Nothing. I'm here. I'm okay. Kind of left me or something else weird? Honestly, it was like you were in a trance. Um. I don't know. I’m not myself. I had a vision about you. A vision? Yea. What happened in the vision? You were, um... You're were being mean to me. And, um... You were scary. I was scared of you. I was trembling. There is something I need to tell you. No, no, no, no. You might want to be seated for the... What is it? I am not who you think I am. What do you mean? I am not Penelope. Or. No, I mean, I am. But I am not. I don't understand. No, of course you're not understanding. Sit down. I need to explain it to you, Jeffrey. Basically. I was with many men. While we were together. What do you mean by you were with? Well, basically, I had many afferas. [laughing] With who? That doesn't matter. Happens so often. I know. I know. I was wrong. But. I was weak. I just really, really wanted to feel all these men inside of me. [laughing] Why are you telling me this? I mean, I just... I can’t keep living with the secret. Why are you telling me this now? Because you're right here. So why should I have to carry all this guilt on my own? Why are you telling me this now? I don't know. Cause I just want to fucking tell you the truth. I can't take this. I need to. It was always so easy. What was easy? Well, they all wanted me. All of them. They all wanted me. Hey Jeffrey. Do you remember all those times we were trying to have kids? That’s really trying to have kids? But we thought, or you thought. But the doctors had some, I don't know, conspiratorial rasputin against us. Remember you were telling me that behind closed doors they would say. Those two are not fit to be parents. Those two should definitely not have kids. I thought you doctor's was actually funny. It was quiet when they should have been talking. Yea. Do you want to know why? Yeah. Tell me why. Because it was me, Jeffrey. It was me. And the reason, because I aborted more than, what? Seven, eight of your children? [laughing] Penelope. How could you kill our children? I don't know. But I did. Ha ha. No. Yes. And I would do it all over again. [laughing] Where do you think you're going? You know what I think? What? I think a none of this is real. I think I'm going out of my mind. Hey. It's the truth. I know you don't want to hear it, but sorry. It's the truth. How could you do something like that? I don't know. Because I'm a mean fucking cunting bitch. How could you do something like that and not even think twice, Penelope? And how could you kill a man and not think twice? Stop it. Murder is not abortion, okay? You can't compare the two. I didn’t. Yes, you did. You just said it was the same. No? Don't you feel sorry or bad at all? Die slowly please. Good. Did slowly. I am. Good. You look so pitiful. Well, you know, then I guess that was always the thing that I found kind of intriguing about you. You're a murderer, Jeffrey. Who takes lives. You don't create them. Of course. Now, Billy and I. We have two kids. And we're so happy. But I think I'm even happier rendering you fatherless forever. Don't you have anything to say? I... No, I don’t... I don't know what to say. Good because I don't really want to hear what you have to say anyway. Do you remember the Christmas party at your workplace? Yeah? Where you introduce me to Uriah? Your big dominant boss. Can I? Don’t t ouch her. Little bro. And I could tell immediately that he was into me. And you could, too. That's why you became jealous when it. And I. I pretended not to notice so that you wouldn't get upset. So that later on during that party, I was at the juice bar and then he came over. And he took me back to the storage closet. He did some amazing things to me. Things that you could never do. I was so satisfied after that Christmas party. Oh. I didn't tell you, Jeffrey, because. I didn't want you to lose your job because you could never stand up to him. Because you don't kill the powerful and dominant. Do you? You prey on the weak. Why are you being so? Why do you want to hear more? No. No, I don't. Because I have plenty more where that came from. Jeffrey. Look at you. What's left for me now is just. To move on. To leave you in the past. Oh. And I'm sorry that I got to do that by destroying you. I think that I am not sorry at all. Why do you want to destroy me? Because you deserve it. You don't deserve a life. Penelope. We could have had children. Ugh. The thought of having something that's half me. Half you. Never. I could never do it. Well, never. Okay. We're done here. Shall we leave the past in the past? Good. I'm going leave, so. Oh. Remember the first time? That you introduced me to Billy. Your best friend Billy, at the Super Bowl party or whatever It was. When I met him, I walked up to him. And I said. I want you Billy. [laughing] [knocking] Hello. Hey. Is everything okay? We heard the starkins. So? Oh. Sorry about that. Uh, we. My wife and I, we live next door. Oh. Oh. Um. No. All good here. Just. My ex-husband had a little bit too much to drink. Okay, well, if you need anything, don't hesitate to call us, okay? Okay. Thank you. Hey. Hey. Could you come back for a second? Yes. Are you single? No, not really. I have a life. But could you be? What? Yeah. I can be, I guess. Okay. Right. Okay. Do you have a phone on you? Yeah. Right here. You look like the funnest fuck. You too. Thank you. You're welcome. Here you go. Thanks. I'll call whenever. What about tonight? What about tonight? You know. Your funnest fuck. You too. See you. See you later. Is that what you wanted to do? Did you want to make me mad? Yes. You're a killer, Jeffrey. You're a monster. Why would you that? Scare me. Hey, man. Hey. How are you? I'm good. How you doing? Good. Uriah wants to see you, though. Any idea why? Oh. I don't ask questions. I just work here. Really? Pretty sure. Well, good luck. Hey, Ray. You wanted to see me? Hey Jeffrey. Thanks for coming in. Have a sit. Is, um... everything okay? No, not really. I'm afraid I'm going to have to let you go. What? Why? Sorry, man. Company's downsizing, and we have to let some people go. Unfortunately, you are one of those people. I could write you a good preference letter and service pace last you a while. Oh. Jeffrey. A woman you brought to the Christmas party. She was amazing, I must say. Wait, what does that mean? That's what that means. You're right. That's my wife you talking about. I know. I fucked her in the storage closet. And I asked her to come over tonight. She said yea. So that's that. Why the fuck would you do something like that? You're going to do something about it ittle bro? Are you going to do something about it, Jeffrey? I get what I like. And I like your wife. He fired me. Hey. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You know. I was just scared. I didn't want you to lose your job because of me rejecting him. You're lying to me and you're cheating on me. I would never cheat on you. He told me he fucked you. He's obviously lying. He said you were going to his house tonight. Just to cook him dinner. To cook him dinner? What about my dinner? I was just scared, you know, I didn't. I didn't mean to hurt you. You didn't mean to hurt me? Penelope? You cheated on me. It's not true. Girl. You better hope I get my shit together. Baby. Don't let that man rile you up. It’s too late. I'm already up. Baby. Don't let any man ruin what we've got going on here. I would never betray you. I would never cheat on you. You know that. There's not a man on the planet that can make me leave you. You're my man. Okay. Come here. I love you. Okay? I’m gonna go. I am gonna leave the in the past, and I suggest you do the same, okay? Actually, I do need you to get out of here. You know, I'm going to renovate, so. Feels like I'm the king or queen. Actually, this must be what Cleopatra felt like. Right before she saw her enemies heads drop to the floor. Feels like power. And you're just a pawn in my game. Oh, do you hear that fucking ice cream truck? What? Why are you being this way to me? Interesting. How the beast can be brought to his knees by a divine feminine. You know, that was always your downfall, Jeffrey. You couldn't handle a strong woman God. I am woman God. Come now. Wash my feet. [laughing] I am the one who exists within your spouse. I come from the spirit of Delilah. I watched Samson fall at the temple of Daggett. Yes. I am the one who is responsible for your wife's adultery. I have lived with her before she was born, and I want you to tremble. Oh, that's cold. Oh, come on. Yea. Yea. Oh that’s good. Yea. Sorry to bother you, man. I was in the room with Penelope and I thought to myself, maybe you can use some company. What the fuck are you doing here? I'm doing your wife, little bro. Look, everything's going to be okay. I'm here. We'll get through this together. You think this is funny? All the police are going to come looking for you. You're definitely going to have to go missing now. Oh, yeah, but. I bet you'd like that. So you can do whatever you want. Well, it seems like you have no choice, does it, Jeffrey? I am. Woman God. I gotta get out of here. I gotta get out of here. Can I ask you something? What’s that? What if I'm not ready to move on? I already moved on. What about today? What if I didn't let you move on today? What if I stayed in this house so you couldn't renovated? Then what? You're not going to do any of this, Jeffrey. You are going to accept your fate. And move on. I think. This whole thing. Is not real. I think I'm going out of my mind. Jeffrey, you know why you are here. No. You have been temporarily disabled. Your mind is glitching. Wait. What? Your mind is glitching. You've been brought back to reality temporarily. I don't know. I don't understand what's happening. Your mind is trying to help you to deal with the pain. Don't worry. You'll be safe here. Who are you? The words for the subject. What's your name? Therapist. Your name is therapist? Actually, I have no name. Neither do you. They may exist in the reality that you’ve just come from. But here there are no names. No. Replenishment. No, thank you. I'm not hungry. You've been asleep for 369 years. I assure you, you are hungry and thirsty. You are hungry and thirsty. Y’all motherfuckers are crazy. What's happening right now? How does it feel not to know? I don't understand. It's a simple question. What's it like not to know? Okay. All right, I get it. It's like I'm in the dark. Yes. Very good, Jeffrey. It is like being in the dark. You're in the dark because you don't know what's happening. Is it a pleasant feeling? No. It's quite morbid, actually. Morbid? What just happened? I don't talk like that. You're talking the way that you always talk. No, I'm not. I assure you, you are. And how can you be so sure? I birthed you. What? I Birthed you. You're a man. I'm a what? A man. Yes? You need to speak. In silence. Okay. I see. A man is what is called the gender in the human race. Yes. Now I understand the confusion. Well, I'm the one that's not confused. Yes. Yes what? You see? You are not human. What? Humans do not exist. Nothing exists. As of now. No, that’s impossible. If I'm not a human, then what am I? A motherfucker. What did you say? A motherfucker. A motherfucker. Do you really want to be aware? Yeah. Yeah. I think not. If I'm not a human, then what am I? You are a program, Jeffrey. You are. A digital simulation of a human being. Nah. No, I must been going crazy here. I'm flesh and blood. Flesh and blood. Flesh and blood. Flesh and blood. Two of the generalized modules that make up the hallucination known as human. There is no such thing as flesh and blood. Flesh and blood are biological and chemical properties that can be. You are just a program, Jeffrey. Okay, I get it. I think I'm going crazy. I'm going insane. And you better stop lying to him. What was that? What was what? My dream. What did it mean? I don't know. You tell me. Uh oh. I wasn't. I was like, I was there, but I wasn't real. The world wasn't real. That doesn't sound too bad. It was horrible. It was like I was a. It was like I was a computer program or something. Wow. I am sorry to break it to you. But this is real. You are real. I'm real. What I'm doing to you is real. What are you doing to me? I'm destroying you. You're not destroying me. Yes, I am. And I won't stop until I'm completely done. That doesn't make sense. Why would my wife destroy me? Ex wife Right. Why would my ex-wife destroy me in a dream? It's not a dream, Jeffrey. It's reality. Like I’ve said, we're flesh and blood. We are real. You're real. I am real. This is real. No. No. No. This is not real. Why were you upset when she told you about the baby on the beach? What the hell are you doing? I'm so confused. Don't be. But none of this is making any sense. It doesn't have to make sense Jeffrey. I don't understand what's going on, what's happening? What difference does it make if you know what's happening or not? Because I hope to try to stop you. Stop me from what? From moving on. Remember that one time when we went to the beach? It was you and me or my cousin Gregory. He wasn't my cousin Jeffrey. What are you talking about? Penelope. How's the water? It looks fantastic. He was my lover. I was cheating on you with him. Doesn’t it bother you how unfaithful I was to you? Yeah. Yeah. This again? Yes, this again. I told you there was more. You know that one day on the beach. I got pregnant. And it wasn't from you because you and I hadn't done anything for months. No, it was from Gregory. But I had a miscarriage. But I didn't tell you because I wanted to be more like you. No. Yes Jeffrey. No. No. This is called destruction. You're not real, Jeffrey. None of this is real. Are you trying to fuck with me right now? No. We're computer simulations, Jeffrey. You're not real. I'm not real. But we are. You are. Because the pain that you feel in this moment is very real. Right? What's this? Got something to do with the government or something? What? They all seem like, some freaky MK ultratype shit or something. Oh, my God. Who? Who? Who's doing this? I have to reveal something. What? We’ve been watched. Don’t look up, they will see us. Right, they will see us. They see us, look down. By who? I don’t know. But maybe. Maybe we can find out together. Together? [door knocking] Oh. Hey. Hey. Why are you back? I just wanted to know when is a good time to visit. It’s not been that long since I tell you I know, but like you said, it might be a fun fucking time. It will be a fun fucking time. Yeah. What's your favorite? Favorite? Position. With you? It would definitely be face to face. Yeah, that's my favorite. I’m excited. Let's do it. Ow! Ow! Oh! More. More. This is one of the most exciting days I've had in years. Jeffrey, are you done yet?
