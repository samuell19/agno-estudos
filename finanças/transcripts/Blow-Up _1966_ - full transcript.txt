Stripes, let the dress just fall down. Absolutely fall. Keep the stripes steady. It's very important to keep... Just let your arms go up and down. Yes! Very tasty. Yes, I like it, I like it. Go on. Yeah. All right, change position. Yup. Wake up! Now, you can thank your lucky stars you're working with me, can't you? All right, one more. And a smile now. Come on. Smile. Smile! God. I asked you to smile. What's the matter? Have you forgotten what a smile is? Eh? All right, you're all tired now. Go on, relax. I can't see your eyeballs anymore. They're just slits. Go on. Close your eyes. Close your eyes. And stay like that. It's good for you. Sometimes you really dig a girl The moment you kiss her And you get distracted by her older sister Then in walks her father and takes you a line Close your eyes. That must be five or six years old. They don't mean anything when I do them. Just a mess. Afterwards I find something to hang on to. Like that... Like that leg. Then it sorts itself out... and adds up. It's like finding a clue in a detective story. Don't ask me about this one. I don't know yet. - Can I buy it? - No. Will you give it to me? There. Mmm. Thanks. Tight-faced bastard. He won't sell me one of his crappy paintings! Mmm. I'll creep down one night and knock it off. Mmm, don't stop. It's lovely. - You look tired. - Mmm. I've been all night in a doss house. They say they've been asked to come here. Not by me. Well, we weren't exactly asked. Sorry. I'm busy. They're printing some snaps for me upstairs. Go and fetch 'em. Couldn't you give us just a couple of minutes? A couple of minutes? I haven't even got a couple of minutes to have my appendix out. You're in a whole lot of trouble Didn't know you had a double Dab my feet in the water Thought you was an only daughter Seen a whole lot of trouble Wow, Jubilee - When can we come then? - Don't. The others still waiting with their eyes shut? Yes, they're waiting, but their eyes are open. Good. Then tell them to shut 'em again. Get rid of that bag. It's diabolical. Can we come back this afternoon? - What do you want? - Just looking around. There are no cheap bargains here. You're wasting your time. Well, I'll just have a look. - What are you lookin' for? - Pictures. No pictures. What kind of pictures? Landscapes. Sorry. No landscapes. Sold. All sold. - You the owner? - No. The owner is out. Expecting him? What are you doing? Stop it! Stop it! Give me those pictures. You can't photograph people like that. Who says I can't? I'm only doing my job. Some people are bullfighters. Some people are politicians. I'm a photographer. This is a public place. Everyone has the right to be left in peace. It's not my fault if there's no peace. You know, most girls would pay me to photograph them. I'll pay you. I overcharge. There are other things I want on the reel. What do we do then? I'll send you the photographs. No, I want them now. Ow! What's the rush? Don't let's spoil everything. We've only just met. No, we haven't met. You've never seen me. - Hello. - Hello. - Uh, my agent saw you about the shop. - Did he? He's a man with a cigar. Throws ash everywhere. I expect I remember him. I probably asked for too much money. Money's always a problem, isn't it? Tell him to come back. Why are you selling? I'd like to try something different, get off somewhere. I'm fed up with antiques. - Get off where? - To Nepal. Nepal is all antiques. - Is it? - Mm-hmm. Perhaps I'd better try Morocco. - How much? - What? The propeller. You can have it for... eight pounds. Right. You're in business. Have you got a van? You can't take it now. I must. I must. - I can't live without it. - Hard luck. That'll teach you to fall in love with heavy things on Saturday morning. - Is that it? - That's it. You can't treat it like that. It's not a delivery van. Who cares? Leave it to me. Something will turn up. Yes. All right. But it'd better turn up today. Oi! Blue 439. Blue 439. Over. Blue 439. Go ahead, please. Over. Hello, this is, uh... Get me Flaxman double 2-4-9. Mr. Walker. Mr. Peter Walker. Tell him I've seen the junk shop. It's a bit pricey, but I think the kid'll come down. Let him ring her right away. Then nobody else will get it. Roger. Wilco. Stand by. Blue 439. Blue 439. Over. Blue 439. Blue 439. Go ahead, Echo. Blue 439. Message passed and understood. Your caller doesn't like it. Over. Tell him to get stuffed. What about all the buildings going up around the place? Already there are queers and poodles in the area. I saw some in the couple of minutes I was there. It'll go like a bomb. Over. Blue 439, what is in the area? Over. - Forget it. Over. - Roger. Wilco. Standing by. You want to use the lot? Don't you like 'em? They're great. We'll use three or four. Spread through the book? No. All together. Yeah. - And a pint. - Yes, sir. - Which one last? - None of this lot. I've got something fab for the end. In a park. I only took them this morning. You'll get them later on today. It's very... peaceful, very still. The rest of the book'll be pretty violent, so I think it's best to end it like that. Hmm? Yes. That's best. Rings truer. I've gone off London this week. Why? Doesn't do anything for me. Yeah. - I've knocked up a few captions. - Yeah? I'm fed up with those bloody bitches. Wish I had tons of money. Then I'd be free. Free to do what? Free like him? Someone we know? Hello? That'll be all right. Good afternoon. Let me hand it over to J.H. Goodman. Thank you, Freddy, thank you. Hello. Could you get me Frobisher 3-double-2-9, please? I've only got a sixpence. Park 1296. Hello. It's me. Weren't you supposed to be going off to, um, Hurley? Hmm? Listen. Stay where you are. Call me soon at home. Mmm. I've come... I've come for the photographs. How did you manage to find me? Do you live here? Mmm. Drink? What's so important about my bloody pictures? That's my business. The light was very beautiful in the park this morning. Those shots should be very good. Anyway, I need them. My private life's already in a mess. It would be a disaster if... So what? Nothing like a little disaster for sorting things out. Have you ever done any modeling? Fashion stuff, I mean. You've got it. Hold that. Not many girls can stand as well as that. No, thanks. I'm in a hurry. You'll get your pictures. I promise. I always keep my word. Come here. Show me how you sit. Ooh. Who is it? Oh, yes, that's right. Hold on a second. Is it for me? It's my wife. Why should I speak to her? Sorry, love. The bird I'm with won't talk to you. She isn't my wife, really. We just have some kids. No. No kids. Not even kids. Sometimes though, it... it feels as if we had kids. She isn't beautiful, she's... easy to live with. No, she isn't. That's why I don't live with her. But even with beautiful girls, you... you look at them and that's that. That's why they always end up, uh... And I'm stuck with them all day long. It would be the same with men. Have a listen to this. No, keep still. Keep still. Listen. Keep still. You can smoke, if you like. Slowly. Slowly. Against the beat. That's it. I can't stand it. I'm nervous enough as it is. Can I have some water? And I'm not a fool, love. Can I have the photographs? Of course. Later. Your boyfriend's a bit past it. Why don't you say what you want? Get dressed. I'll cut out the negatives you want. They'll go. They're not going. Don't go. - Have you bought a propeller? - What? You bought a propeller this morning, right? Oh, yes. You'll have to give us a hand with it. - All right? - Fine, yeah. What's it for? Nothing. It's beautiful. If I had a big room like this, I'd hang it from the ceiling like a fan. - Do you live on your own? - No. Perhaps I'll put it there like a piece of sculpture. It'll look good there. It will break up the straight lines. - Are you going? - It's late. Do I see you again? Well, at least tell me your name or your telephone number. Thank you. Hello? Knightsbridge 1239? What? No, I'm sorry. Ron? Something fantastic's happened. Those photographs in the park... fantastic. Somebody was trying to kill somebody else. I saved his life. Listen, Ron, there was a girl. Ron, will you listen? What makes it so fantastic... Look, hang on, will you, Ron? There's somebody at the door. He is home. You weren't expecting us, were you? No. Could you manage to make a cup of coffee between you? I can make an Irish coffee, if you'd like. All right, come on. - Is she always like that? - Like what? Doesn't speak. What's your name? Ah, forget it. What's the use of a name? What do they call you in bed? I only go to bed to sleep. Hello. Hello. Psst. Look at all these clothes. Ooh. No. Hey, how 'bout this one? Put it on. Oh. What about you? Help yourself. The coffee! Aaah! - What's the matter? - She's got a better figure than me! - Oh, it's not true. - Oh, no! Go on, whack her. Go on. Give her a left hook. Put you in the ring together. Oh! Oh, no! Oh! Oh, no. No! Hold her legs. - Hold her legs! - No! No, no! No! No! No! Let go of me! Right, let's move. Out. You haven't taken any photos. No. Not now. I'm too whacked. It's your own faults. Tomorrow. Tomorrow! Were you looking for something just now? - No. - Oh. Do you ever think of leaving him? No, I don't think so. I saw a man killed this morning. Where? Shot. Some sort of park. Are you sure? He's still there. Who was he? Someone. How did it happen? I don't know. I didn't see. You didn't see? No. Shouldn't you call the police? That's the body. Looks like one of Bill's paintings. Yes. Will you help me? I don't know what to do. What is it? Huh? I wonder why they shot him. I didn't ask. Hello, Ron? Oh, love, is Ron there? No, I just wanted to take him somewhere. Where is he? Okay, I'll fetch him there. Bye-bye, love.

Here, have a drag. I want you to see the corpse. We've got to get a shot of it. I'm not a photographer. I am. What's the matter with him? What did you see in that park? Nothing. Ron?
