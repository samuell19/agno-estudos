You're fine? - How's your foot? - It hurts. Put that on your foot. - Where's the bathroom? - Over there. Suddenly the bass/jis attacked I don't/mow Where they came from.

You saved our lives. - I didn't do anything. - Yes, you did. - May I have a glass of water? - Of course. Thanks a lot. - Thanks. - One more? Yes, please. Thanks again. My name is Sara. In case you wanted to know. Where is that painting from? A friend of mine drew it. Really? - Do you like it? - The portrait? No, Forough. Her poetry. I prefer this. May I have a cigarette? Does the smoke bother you? - Go ahead. - Would you like one? - I quit. - You're lucky. As soon as I stop, I feel like smoking again! Do you have alight? Are you leaving or moving out? What's the difference? Don't you know?! It's a big place. I bet the good books have been packed already. Who's Sholokhov? - A Russian writer. - That smells like left wing! - And how does the left smell? - Don't play dumb! But he's a good writer. - She hasn't been gone long. - Who? - Your wife. - What makes you say that? There are traces of her everywhere. Mark his name? He's baring oflrficu/z', Come on .7) Hi... Not yet. The only thing we need is the vice minister's signature. Yes. Nobody can be reached these days, you know. I'll keep you posted. Bye. Sorry, I broke it. - It's just undone. - Then I'll fl>< it again. - It's too big for your hands. - No way. I'll fl>< it myself. I'll take care of it. Sorry. If I promise not to touch anything will you let me stay a bit longer? You're a bit like Faust, you know. Like Faust? - How come? - How can I explain... Lonely and mysterious in this big flat. As if you'd sold your soul to the devil. I'm not quite like Faust. He sold his soul for the sake of others, but not me. What did Faust want from the devil? - Haven't you read it? - What? Faust? No. I just know that he sold his soul to the devil. So, what's your deal with the devil? You can't talk about such things. It was almost rebuilt. The end is the hardest. Like everything else. - Are you cold? - No. It happens to me sometimes. You shiver when people step on your grave. - Grave? - Yes. Mine must be in a public place. Because I shiver all the time. - How strange. - What? To think about death at your age. There's no age to think about death. - What time is it? - 8 o'clock. It's late. I have to go. - Shall I call a cab? - Do you have ADSL? Yes, I do. Can I use the internet for a second. Do you mind? - Go ahead. - Thanks. What are you doing? Nothing special. Just a few emails to my friends. Nothing sketchy. "Danger. Bassijis are hunting the protesters. #|rane|ection" "Moussavi says, welcome the police with flowers. We want peace." - How are you, Jaleh? - Not bad. - And An a hid? - She's fine too. And you? - I'm OK. - I miss you. - What time is it there? - 9 PM. Were you asleep? - You sound... - I stayed up late last night. Wait a minute. - When did you go to bed? - I don't know. - On your computer? - Yes, I worked till late. - So? Finally? - What? - You're done with your business? - No. When are you coming? - I don't know. - You promised. - As soon as possible. - But when? - Stop asking me. - Whafre you, kidding? - No I'm not! - Why are you shouting? - You keep asking me the same thing. - And you're not keeping your promise. - Pass me An a hid. - She's asleep. - Sleeping? - Yes. - So early? - She had gym today. - What about the protests? - Still continuing. - What's going to happen? - I don't know. - Things are getting tense. - Yes, it's total chaos. - Can you send me some money, Ali? - Sure, how much? 20000 dollars. - Yes? - I'm Fati Khanoum's niece. Come in. - Hi. - Come in. Come on in. My aunt is ill so she sent me to do the cleaning. I hope it's nothing serious. No, she hurt her back yesterday, while mopping the floor. - What's your name? - Mehri. You've grown up. - Want some water? - Don't bother. No trouble. Thank you. - Are you a student? - I passed the university entrance exam. - Want some more? - No, thanks. - Shall I clean your bedroom? - No, leave it. I'm done, sir. How are you getting home? A taxi till Vanak, and the express bus to the Central Station. - Here. - You're too kind. - Please... - Thanks. How long does it take you? Usually 2 hours, but since the election, there's more traffic. Thanks so much. - Hi. - Your weekly order. - How much is it? - 10500. - Keep the change. - Thanks, Mr. Sepehri. Shortly after 8 RM, gun shots were heard North o/'Azao? Square. Accoroflvhg to Mr'. Mousavifis of ice the shots were com/hg from the Bass/j HO, North ofAzaot Square. -Hi. -Hi. Bassijis chasing you again?! - No, I came to pay you back. - Pay me back? I took it from you this morning. I was broke. Thanks. I steal from you and you thank me? Boy, you are cool! Still protesting? It's just the beginning. Tell me about it? You seem totally indifferent. As if you were living in Switzerland? Would you like some tea? Tea? No, thanks. I'm starving. - Aren't you hungry? - No. Please say you're hungry! Let me see what I have. I don't want to bother you. Unless you let me cook. - What's this? - Cheese. - It stinks. - Because it's ripe. You mean rotten! - And this? - It's pastrami. Pastrami? Never heard of it. - Whafre you making? - A Gloubi-boulga. - A what? - A Gloubi-boulga. I learnt it from my mom. A bit of salt... And now some oil... That's it. - A taste? - No, thanks. I Will. Dinner is served. Isn't there anything else to drink? I'm thirsty. There might be some alcohol-free beer. I said, I'm thirsty! Something to toast with. Don't you have an alcohol dealer? Shall I go to the pharmacy? They might have grain alcohol. Let me see... I'll try to find something. How about this? Wine? - Where did you get it from? - My hiding place! I opened it in a wink. - What did you have for lunch? - Lunch? I think I forgot to eat. What? You can't imagine forgetting to eat? I had a piece of pavement! Easy! It's an old wine. It's a... - Khollar? - Yes, Khollar from Shiraz. - Does Shiraz have wine? - It did, before the revolution. This is the last bottle, from the year of the revolution. You can say thanks, if you like the food. And if I don't? You can say it doesn't taste good, but that's crossing a red line. So I can't say what I want? No, that's not it. You can say it's tasty, but if it tastes bad, you shouldn't say so. So I can say what I want, unless it's forbidden?! Then I'm crossing the line? Yes, somehow. Cause this ls Tehran. The city of provocation. What is that? Never heard it before. It's rap... rap. From whom? - Nobody. - Nobody? It's the name of the rapper. It's for young people. Not people your age. I see! This is Tehran, you see... You have to be careful not to cross any red lines. One word too many and bang... Loud laughter and bang... A lock of hair out of the scan' and dong... Before you know it, you've crossed a line. But our dear "Brothers" are here to bring us back to the right path. - And then? - Then? Yes, once your movement... What do you call it? - The Green Wave. - Once everything is green, then what? All the red lines will be gone. - None at all? - Yes, there'll be no more red lines. And then what? Total chaos. Right? Yes, a huge Gloubi-boulga. But a tasty one. Then the Mullah's will fly away. We'll send them to the moon. Just imagine... Then we'll do what we want, wear... - How will you do that? - With all the... testosterone that has been piling up in men's balls. We'll send the Mullah's to the moon. Maybe even farther. -To... -To Mars. Yes, to Mars. The farther, the better. Know what? This seems like a sign. The two of us sitting here... ...drinking an old Khollar. Doesn't that mean anything? Really? Isn't it a sign? No, it's not. It's just a coincidence. I didn't have anything else to drink. No, it's not just a coincidence. Didn't you keep this wine for a special occasion? This is a special occasion. Isn't it? I have to go. I've got a date. Shall I call a cab? No, it's a virtual date! Can I use your computer again? - Do you want to be my Follower? - Follower? I'll open an account for you. Follower... folover You see... Follower... Folover... Lover. Well... almost. Let's see... Your log in will be "Dr. Faust". - Choose a password. - 1988. Too short. Another one. Then "SUMMER 1988". - Will you remember it? - I'll never forget it. Martyr Mohammad Mofateh University Libra/y - It's me. - Come in. Hi Simin. What a surprise! You don't let me in? I almost went back home, because of the traffic jam. You must see this. All of Tehran is out on the street. It used to be only cars, now there are cops and bassijis besides. Look at the helicopters. There are some black vans out there. Never saw them before. People say they're Chinese. It's like civil war, Ali. How will it all end? Did I disturb you? Sit down for a minute. Were you expecting someone else? Who else drops by without prior notice? - How are you? - Me? Fine. And where's your wedding ring? On my desk. ls the interrogation over? Nice fragrance... Not one of those cheap perfumes! Well, well... Candle-lit dinner. How romantic! You still had some bottles left? It was the last one. Is this your glass? Yes. To the friend for whom you open your last bottle of Khollar! Your books haven't moved an inch! You haven't started packing yet? Not yet. How are Jaleh and An a hid? I just talked to her. - An a hid was asleep. - Is Jaleh OK? - Is her work going well? - She didn't say. Even in Iran it's hard for freelance photographers. Not to mention Canada. Today is going to be hell. You mean the heat? No... I mean the rally. You're so out of it! Can I have a drag? Din't you quit? What? Yes, I'll take one, thanks. - One what? - Turkish coffee, silly boy. Thanks... You're welcome! - I think I'm going to go. - Where to? To the rally, of course! To take pictures? What for? We can't just sit around and not do anything. Don't you think? I know how it'll all end. They'll make a mess of it, just like us. This time is different. What's the difference? - Young people have taken to the streets. - Young people?! Weren't we young too, back in the '80s? Look what they did to us. It's just a bunch of rich kids. Nothing is going on downtown. - Who said it's rich kids? - Listen to the traffic report after the rallies. All the traffic is going uptown. You're still optimistic like in the old days, Simin. And you're still a good debator, my dear Ali. What does this have to do with the traffic report? These young people are not like we were, back then. They don't want to change the world, just live their lives. Live their lives! You still make great coffee. I didn't know you read the coffee grounds. Now that you've started socializing... - You could invite me as well. - OK. No false promises! If you don't want to invite me in, we'll eat out. I'm going to the US for a while. You have time to think it over. Why didn't you say that before? What would you have done had I told you?! You have to leave too. Where to? Why? I don't know. Maybe you're right. Why leave the country? Promise not to do anything foolish. OK? I promise. Word of honor... You'd promise anything, to get rid of me. Quite right! What's up? - You should have seen the crowd. - Where? Everywhere... I'd never seen so many people before. I felt like kissing them all. - And you? - Me? Nothing. What do you mean, nothing? Didn't you go out? " Me? - No? I was busy. You were busy?! What do you mean? All of Tehran was out on the streets, and you say you were busy?! Take me in your arms. Hold me tight. She's going far away. Leaving a loved one behind. Someone who has doubts. A man in the shadows. Someone like you. So, who is it? The one who's in love or the man in the shadows? - Who signed the cup? - Signed the cup? Here... look. A friend who came by at noon. You read the coffee grounds? A friend who you make Turkish coffee for? I don't believe you! I give in. You win! - Yes. - Hello, Mr. Sepehri. We're here to visit the flat. Can't we do this another time? But we made the appointment on the phone, yesterday. - Mr and Mrs Amini. - Hi. Please, come in. Go ahead. I'll be right there. - Please show them around. - Yes. If you allow me, then... I'll spare you the basics. Have a look at the living room. And what a view! In my opinion... ...you won't find a nicer flat in this neighborhood. Follow me. This should be very interesting for madame. Look at the kitchen. Fully equipped. There are two rows of cupboards. Fridge and washer. It's all high quality. - The kitchen is really dark. - Let's visit the rest first. - You're not the one who cooks all day! - This way, please... A nice little flat like this must have a lot of potential buyers. Yes, I guess. And then? - And then what? - Where will you go? I don't know yet. I'm sure... ...you'll like it, Mr. Amini. Hello, madame. There's another room over there. This way, please. Mr. Sepehri uses it as his study. But it can be turned into a guest room. Here is the bathroom. Follow me. Leaving the country? Yes, with your permission! It's a free country. People can go and come as they please. Or not come back! Yes, that's possible as well. The living room is quirky. - I don't like living rooms like this. - That's not a problem. You just have to add a wall, to separate it from the dining room. Follow me, I'll show you. - Are you related to Haj Mohamad Sepehri? - Haj Mohamad Sepehri? A real man... We served together, during the war. He was lucky to become a martyr. I didn't have the pleasure of knowing him. But your face is familiar to me. Maybe we've met on the front? - I wasn't here during the war. - You mean... - You were not in Iran? - I was, but didn't go to the front. - I see. - Sorry, Mr. Amini... - I have another appointment, so... - Let's go. Let's leave. I'll be with you in a minute. You know the way out. Mr. Sepehri... Don't let me down this time. These are good clients and they'll pay upfront. If you take too long to decide, you might not find others like them. Especially after the election, with the unrest and all... Prices are falling. If you don't make up your mind, you won't sell at the same price. - Lot's of people are selling. - I'll keep you posted. If you keep hesitating, the birds will fly away! - Good day, madame. - Good bye. Good bye. You should listen to those who know. You've got to sell. Or the birds will fly away! Listen my dear... Life is like a bus. Each of us must get off at his stop, so that someone else can get on the bus. Now, it's your turn to get off so that those people can take your seat. Why don't you get it? Stop hitting. Let him go! You want me to stop filming, then you can start beating? Hit me! Go ahead. You are hitting all the men. Go ahead, hit them. Come and hit me too! What's wrong? It's so red! I wanted to be pretty for the rally! Why did you break them, then? Just because. They'll grow back. Does it hurt? It hurts here. I understand. Did you want to, or did you do it for me? What about you? Me? I had to do it, to get all that nasty stuff out of my head. They call us sluts. "|'|| fuck you in every hole you nasty bitch!" That's how bassijis talk to us. And when they don't say it, you can read it in their filthy eyes. You feel it in their laughter. If only you could see their eyes, when they're beating us. It's freaky. It's as if they're raping you with their stick. You see what I mean? If only they were here to see us! Sara! Allah-o-akbar! Allah-o-akbar! Help me. Will you come to the rally? You're busy, right? Business to do? - I don't believe in those things any more. - Why? I've already paid my dues. Where? When? You weren't even born. Stop bragging about your age! I'm not bragging. You asked me. I answered. - We tried and failed. - Then you should have tried harder. If you had held on, back then, we wouldn't be in this shit now. Why do you keep coming? What do you want? Don't you know? I want to hear it from you. I thought I already told you. A bed with a man in it. A bed with a man! What do you know about me? I know enough. You're Sara and you're 25. Even that might not be true. Maybe I'm Nasrin, Mehri, or Mina. You don't know a thing about me. And you? Don't you want to know who I am? You? You're Ali. - You're 50 years old. - Not bad, so far. And you've locked yourself up. Who says so? Oh, come on... When was the last time you went out? A year ago or two maybe? And the day you decide to go out, you'll fly across the world. - Then everything will be over. - Who said I was leaving? I saw your ticket myself. Aren't you going to Canada? Never mind... Don't worry. I told you before... It's fine with me, too. Hi, Mr. Sepehr/I Rezvan/ from the travel agency. We must/ssue your ticket before tomorrow Please call me.

"Don't make sparks!" It's him. My name is All Sepehr/I Ana' I'm here to share my experience. So that others dontgo astray like me. I was lucky to get arrested. Aha' to get to know the Brothers, who guided me /hto the r/Qqhtpath. In 7.986', / benefited from tne Islamic clemency once. I was then a member of the mamst-len/h/sz' group "Red Star" and/ collaborated Mth the counter-revolutionaries. After my release in 7.98.9 I was contacted by the organ/zaftoo during a tr/p to Europe. A biz' before five presrdenfie/ e/ecfion, we were ford to prepare for a bx; operation mfiv five code name 'P/Qqgeo' Election" Whose execufive branch was to be cal/ea' "Green Wave". Stop playing the victim. We have no time. You're talking to the spectators. If you start complaining, I'll tear you apart. Speak! The day after the election, a girl contacted me with the code name "Persian Star". She... She operated according to the pattern of the color revolution that has already been tested by the enemies of the revolution and worldwide imperialism in other countries. In order to create a protest movement and to achieve a soft overthrow, using electoral fraud as a pretext. My mission was to collect the information given to me by Persian Star and her friends about the so-called "Rigged Election" and the engineered protest movement and to spread this propaganda, especially to the Western Media. In order to... ...launch an international media war against the regime. This was the first phase of our operation. "Persian Star" was the code name of Sara. Sara was her real name. She said she had many other names. That none of what she was saying was true. Except for one thing. Except for what? - Except for what? - I don't know. Except what? Come closer. Except what? Call Haj Agha Amini. Haj Agha Amini... You promised to collaborate. Right? Yes. Didn't you say that your relationship with this girl was sexual? Our relationship wasn't purely sexual. What was it then? If not sexual, then what was it? - Go ahead! - I don't know. - What were their names? - I don't remember. Then we'll have to talk about your trip to Israel again. - You were in Israel in 1989. Right? - I've never been to Israel. What if the Brothers say that you have? Our dear Sepehri was the same 20 years ago. He's stubborn at first, but ends up collaborating. Isn't that so, Mr. Sepehri? - This time, it's different. - Is it different? And in what way? Carry on. What was her name? What do you know about her? - Her eyes... - What do you know about her? I remember her eyes. What about her holes?! I remember her voice. Get up! Sit down. Arrange your hair. Start again. From the beginning... It was an ordinary day. I was working at home. The door of the flat, I don't know why,had been left open. Suddenly, a group of people rushed into my house. I believe there were 4 guys and 3 girls. All young. That's how I first met Sara. That's enough.
