[♪♪♪] LARRY & MOE: I do. I now pronounce you man and wife. Congratulations. And now if you'll excuse me, I have to hurry to testify at a divorce. Goodbye. ALL: Bye. We'll never forget you, boy. If it wasn't for you, we'd have never married your sisters. So I'm a cupid. Anyway, better you should support them than I. [ALL LAUGH] Well, now for our nuptial kiss. [BOTH GRUNT] What's the idea? That's just to show you who's gonna be boss around here. MOE: Now what the-- Wait a minute. Now get out in the kitchen and roast the turkey. Yes, and make some hot muffins and coffee. Wait a minute! We don't know how to cook. It's time you learn. That's what husbands are for. Now get going! Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute! Oh! [BOTH GRUNT] But, girls, I didn't-- BOTH: Shut up! Well, go on, pick the feathers off that turkey while I study how to cook it. Oh! Why you... Wait a minute, Moe. Ow! Do I look like Davy Crockett? Ah, come on. Peel that turkey. Ooh! There must be an easier way to get the feathers off that turkey. I got an idea, wait here. [GRUNTS] Once over lightly. Right, sir. Hey. MOE: I better get busy with this turkey. Gee, fellas, I didn't know my sisters are so mean. To prove it, I'll help you. Yeah? Well get over there and make some muffins and coffee. Go ahead. All right. I'll get back to business here. Uh-oh. Poor turkey, I cut it. Wait a minute I'll get a styptic pencil. Watch your step-tic. [HUMMING] Let's see, now. Muffins, muffins, muffins. "Three spoons of flour." One, two, three. Uh, "add one egg. "Now add some milk. Now, a pinch of baking powder." No, spoon of baking powder. Oh, I'll make it rich. "Now mix well." Please, make like this. Thank you. There we are. Got the aftershave lotion? Right-o. Ah. Powder. [HUMMING] See you later, fellas. See, in order to brown a turkey, you paint it with salad oil. Salad oil, let's see. Maybe it's in here. No. Salad oil. Well. There we are. Rub him down, kid. There we are. Okay. There we are, let's go. Open up the stove, boy. Open that door. It's already lit. Now we'll roast it. That bird will be out of this world. Yeah, it's too good for those elephants we married. Hey, it's on fire. Do something. Step aside. [SIGHS] Good work, kid. Ah, delicious turkey. Nice, hot muffins. And I made them myself. [CRUNCHING] [CRUNCHES] [SQUEAK] Oh, that's that cheap modern furniture. [CHUCKLES] [GULPS] [GROANS] [COUGHS] [SIGHS] Soap. Trying to poison us, eh? You, you no good-- Wait a second. It wasn't-- [MOE & LARRY GRUNTING] Poison us, will you? Whoa! Look, girls, I can explain-- You too! What do you--? Marry us to those no goods. What do you want from me? Get out of our house! Oh, boy, if that's married life, I don't want any part of it. I'll never get married. But you hooked us, you rat. and we'll get even with you. Hey, wait a minute, Shemp. We gotta give a music lesson. Oh, yeah.

That's enough, that's enough. We've done enough for today. You might hurt your voice. You know, bend it, crack it or break it or something. Oh, professor, you're so considerate. Ha-ha-ha! I'm just crazy about you. Don't forget we've got another lesson Tuesday. Gargle with old razor blades. All right, professor. I know you wouldn't want anything to happen to my throat. Except to have somebody cut it. How would you like to be married to a dame like that? Don't even say that. Oh! I ought to-- You ought to what? I ought to be a little more careful. Shut up and listen. Do you remember your Uncle Caleb? Do I? Why, that old tightwad. He'd steal flies from a blind spider. But Shemp he's a-- He's a louse and a weasel. Yeah? Well, he just died and left you 500,000 bucks. Just like that old skinflint. [GASPS] Five hundred thousand bucks? [SQUEALS] But there's one little catch. You get the dough, provided you're married. So wh-- Ah! Married? No. No, fellas. I'm gonna faint. [GROANS] Or... Or what? If you get married within 48 hours of the reading of the will. What time was that? Six o'clock the night before last. You just got seven hours to get yourself a bride. It can't be done, no woman is interested in me. Maybe not, pal. But if you look real hard you might find one interested in half a million bucks! Maybe you got something. Darn right. Know any girls? I got a lot of numbers but I haven't had much luck. You can't get killed for trying. Where's the phone? There's a booth down the hall. Well, what are we waiting for? Down the hall. Hello, is this Ginger Gray? It is? Well this is your little snuggums. I'm about to do you a big favor. Ha-ha. Will you marry me? [LOUD THUD] Oh. Oh. [GRUNTING] Hey, any luck? I got one phone number and one nickel left. Well, start using it. You, clumsy ox, you. Where'd that go? It went down here someplace. MOE: Well, let's find it. Think it went over that side. [BOTH TALKING INDISTINCTLY] MOE: Take this receiver. SHEMP: I got it, I got it. All right, just take it. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. All right. Get this out of my hair here. All right. MOE: Wait a minute. Easy, easy, easy. Come on. Easy, easy. All right, all right. Now wait a minute. Can you dial from there? No, can you? Yeah. [GROANING] Wait a minute. Why don't you come around like this? Get up in this one. How's that? Well, it don't feel as good as when I did... this. Oh, wait, wait, wait. Take it easy. Now, look. We are making no place fast. Let's get at this thing the right way! Get this off. [CRASHING] How you doing? Get your hand out of my face. That ain't my hand, that's your hand. All right, you asked for it. Ow! Gotta get out of this. There isn't much time left. You know that? All right. What happened? That's what I wanna know. Wait a minute. Did you get a load of that? What dish. I wonder who she is. We'll soon find out. Oh, boy? Yes? Who's the new dame? A Miss Hopkins. Miss Hopkins. Did you hear that, kid? And good-looking too. Go get her, Shemp. Heep-eep-eep! Oh, wait a minute. You can't propose to a girl looking like that. We gotta give you the works. Come on. Hello. Oh, hello. Heep-eep-eep! Come in. Cousin Basil, oh! I'm so happy to see you. I-I-- I just been dying to meet you. Uh, I-- And you're even cuter than Aunt Sadie said you were. [KISSING NOISILY] Oh, boy. Success. Yeah, listen to those kisses. [KISSING NOISILY] Cut it out. Oh, you must be exhausted after your long trip. Sit down. Let me look at you, Cousin Basil. Oh. [PHONE RINGS] Now, don't you go away. Hello? Yes, this is Miss Hopkins. You're Cousin Basil? Well, then who is...? I was just-- How dare you pretend to be my Cousin Basil? I'll teach you a thing or two, you wolf! Don't you dare strike me! Taking advantage of a poor, weak, helpless woman! You, you-- You horrible person, you! [GRUNTS] Get up. Here you are. What happened, kid? Can I help it if I ain't Cousin Basil? Oh, professor! Are you all right? Oh, I'm fine. All I wanted to do was propose-- Propose? Oh, professor, this is so sudden. You mean you'll really marry him? Oh, of course. He's my little old dreamboat. Your little dreamboat is sailing. Whoo! Wait a minute. You're gonna sail away from a half a million bucks? We only got two hours left. Come on, get going. Say, here's the license. My pal wants to get married in a rush. Oh, splendid. [PHONE RINGS] Oh, excuse me. Hello? Who? Mr. Howard? Yes, he's here. Hello? Yes. What? How many of them? Wow. Yeah, yeah. Okay, thanks. That was the clerk at the apartment. Those dames you phoned this morning found out about the 500 grand in the papers. Come on, pal, we gotta make this fast. Have you got the ring? Why, certainly. BENTON: Join hands, you love birds. Uh-oh. [WOMEN SHOUTING] [ALL SHOUTING] I waited a long time. Wait a minute! wait a minute! Who is this character? BENTON: She's the bride. Oh, yeah? Not while I got my strength. Tell 'em. Didn't you propose to me? Yes, but I'm with-- Didn't you? Yes, but you turned me down. That was before I read the papers. Now I accept. Look at that. We better do something fast. Yeah. [WOMEN SHOUTING] Wait a minute, wait a minute. What's going on here? [ALL SHOUTING] MOE: Ow! Ow! Ladies! Ladies! [WOMEN SHOUTING] LARRY: Ow! [GRUNTING] [WOMEN SHOUTING] [SHEMP GROANS] [WOMEN SHOUTING] Oh, no, Justice, please. Please. Hurry up. Yes, yes, yes. Hold the hands, you love birds. [BIRDS CHIRPING] [GASPS] Oh, my goodness. [GROANING] Ooh! Ooh, ooh! [ALL SHOUTING] Wait a minute. You wouldn't hit a lady with that? Use this. It's bigger. Oh, thanks. [ALL SHOUTING] [GASPS] Oh! Will you marry me? Never. [GROANING] I'll lure 'em to sit down. [ALL SHOUTING] [BEEPING] [SCREAMING] Now what do you say? I give up. I'll marry you. [WOMEN SHOUTING] [GASPS] Oh, Mr. Benton, please, please, hurry. Hold hands, you love birds. [BOTH GRUNTING] How are you? What do you mean how am I? Congratulations, both of you. Oh, thank you. Yes, yes. We're married. What happened? You'll find out. Well, wise guy, your Uncle Caleb is not dead, you don't have $500,000 but you are married. Oh! Yeah, now we're even. Why, you no-good, double-crossing rats. Why you...
