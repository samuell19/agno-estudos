[Chad] So you've seen it? [Dean] Only in pictures. I helped Julie out with a lot of research. [female voice whispers] Welcome. [Chad] All right, let's go! We've got a long drive ahead of us. [Mike] We're headed to famous Goldfield Hotel. We're hoping to see some real ghosts. [Julie] No. Don't film me, please! [Dean] Can't believe your parents spend twenty grand a year on you with a ghost major. -Psychology major. -[Dean] I'm sorry. [Julie] There's a difference. [whispers] My Baby. [Julie] The hotel is said to be haunted by various people who died there. [Julie] Most notably, Elizabeth. [Julie] Who's searching her child. [Julie] People say they can hear baby cries in the halls late at night. [female whispers] Are you ready to die... for love? [Julie] This is going to be awesome! -[Dean] I bet. -[Julie] How often you see a haunted hotel? [Julie giggles] [Mike] if you start kissing and making out and shit... [Chad] If that happens give me the camera! -[Julie] Why do guys love that? -[Chad] Girls gone wild! [Julie] It's so stupid! [Keri] Guys love girls on girls. Why is that hot? [Mike] Girls on girls is cheaper. [Chad] What happens here stays here. -[Keri] So lame. -[Julie] Do you know psychics believe the hotel itself may be a portal to the other side? [Dean] The hotel's closed, right? [Julie] Yeah. It's more of a museum, now. The town is abandoned since the mine closed, over thirty years ago. [Mike] Okay, I got it! I know what we should do! We should run haunted tours of the place! T-shirts, coffee mugs... [Chad] Dean, the most intelligent guy in the world filling up the vehicle. Beautiful Julie, working on her thesis. How's it going? [Julie] Very exciting stuff. [Julie] First, we'll visit the caretaker of the Hotel. He runs this bar in town. He'll give us the keys and he said we can film as much as we want. Wow. How'd you swing that? I said we were filming for the Discovery Channel. [chuckles] [soft music playing] [Chad] It says we turn off here. That will lead us right into town. Should save us an hour or two. I don't know. Sometimes shortcuts don't work out. What do you say Miss Producer? Do it! [eerie music] [female whispers] Come to me. Come back to me. [Mike] What's that? [Dean] That didn't sound good. [Mike] What's wrong with this piece of shit? [Dean] I don't know. It just died. [Chad] Dean, what's going on? [Dean] Uh, nothing. It just died. [Mike] I knew this was a piece of shit. [Dean] My cousin had it tuned up. Nothing's wrong with it. "Nothing wrong with the car Mike" Is that why it stopped and the engine's dead? -To check out the scenery? -Okay, Mike... shut up. [Dean sighs] Let me check the engine. You better check the engine. [Chad] What's wrong? [Dean] I have no idea. [Mike] Oh, come on! You're supposed to be the smart one. [Dean] I don't know why but the engine's dead. [Chad] Looks like we're walking. [Keri grunts] I'm not walking! [Julie] I don't think we have a choice. What are we going to do? Stand here? -[Julie] Come on. -[Keri] No, you guys! [Mike] Get your camera! [Julie] We've been walking so long it's dark already. [Chad] We'll get there soon. [Chad] Hey, let me film a little. [Chad] We're on route to Goldfield Hotel... Minus a car. [Chad] How's Julie doing? [Julie] Not having much fun but forging along. [Chad] Want to add anything? [Mike] Yeah. This happens when you drive a 15 year old piece of shit! [Dean] Up yours Mike! [Mike] Relax, bro. I was kidding! [Dean] Whatever. [Mike] You are so uptight when you're on a screen all day. [Dean] But I'm not chasing ass all day. [Mike] Dude, are you accusing me of something? [Dean] Forget about it. I'm just pissed about the car. [Mike] Just watch it. [Chad] Anyone's had signal? [Julie and Dean] No. [Mike] Hey, look. An old cemetery. Cool! [chuckles] [Mike] Hey guys, start shooting. [Julie] Yeah. I think this is good stuff! [Chad] Yeah. Grab a stick mic in case we want to hear. [Dean] All right. [Keri] I think I'll stay here. Dean? What? [Keri] You're just going to leave me here? [Dean] Well, we're not going to be that far Besides, I got to do the audio. [female whispering] [whispering] Where is my... [whispering] my... baby? [Chad] We're in a cemetery a few miles outside of Goldfield. We're searching for the tombstones of either George Winfield... Or the woman he supposedly killed... Elizabeth. [whispering] Closer my darlings. [whispering] Closer. [Julie] Guys, that looks cool. Go from over there. [Chad] All right. [whispering] There's my tomb... [whispering] Do you remember? [whispering] How could you forget? [whispering angrily] How could you forget? [whispering] Where's my baby? [Julie] Mike? [Dean chuckles] Now's our chance to ditch him. [Chad laughs] [whispering] Where is my baby? [Julie] Okay, where did Mike go? -[Chad] I don't know. -[Julie] Mike? [Julie] Mike! We're going! [whispering] Come home my dear. [screaming] I'm so sorry! [Julie] Keri! You scared the shit out of me! I started hearing things and-- -Where's Mike? -I don't know. -[Chad chuckles] -[Julie] Mike? Mike... Come on! Where are you? -[Keri] Oh God! -[Julie] Mike? [Keri] It's his backpack! [Chad] Where? Oh. -[Julie] Mike! -[Keri] Mike? -[Julie] Mike! -[Keri] Mike? [Julie] Mike! Come on! -[Julie screams] -[Mike laughs] [Julie] You asshole! [Mike] Come on! I got you. And I got you too! [Mike] I did! What? [Chad] Fuck you Mike. Come on! That was funny. [Julie] Come on, you guys. Let's go. [Mike laughs] [Julie] You're horrible! [Mike] You're mad 'cause I got you. Yeah, that's right! You guys have no sense of humor! I'm hungry! Of course you are. Don't be an asshole! If you're hungry then eat something. I don't want chips. Then I can't help you. I figured that out when you left me alone. You wanted to stay. You left me! If that's your attitude you shouldn't have come. I wouldn't have if I had known I'd be walking up a dirt road all day! [Chad] So this is like a ghost town, huh? [Julie] This is a ghost town. The only people who come through here are tourists. [Mike laughs] Like what? Two or three a year? [Chad] Hey, how many people get to spend a weekend in a ghost town? [Mike] Hey! [Keri giggles] No! I need a shower! Yeah? I could help you wash your back. And your front. [laughs] [Keri] I bet you would. -Mike! -What? I'm just joking. Relax. [Dean] Dude! What the fuck? Inappropriate! [Julie] Seriously. Settle down! It was a joke! Yeah, right. Yeah. Hey, Mom? Dad? Are we there yet? [Julie] Okay. Tell me again why I'm dating you? I'll show you. Because you like sleeping in these arms. [Mike chuckles] Oh, my God! There it is! [Keri] Oh my God. [Mike] Energy! [Julie] Hi! -I'm-- -Julie. From Discovery Channel. Yeah. This is my production team. -This is Dean. -Hey. -[Julie] Mike. -[Mike] Yo! [Julie] Chad and Keri. So, you broke down, huh? Yeah. How'd you know? I didn't hear no car before you come in. We actually broke down just before the cemetery. Actually, there's nothing wrong with our car. [bartender] There's no tow truck until tomorrow. Where you gonna stay? At the Haven Motel. Really? [Julie] About twenty minutes outside of town. There ain't no hotel within a hundred miles of this place. It can't be. I spoke with someone. I've lived here my whole life. Little lady, I'm telling you. There ain't no hotel. Don't worry guys... I'll call. Hi. [Operator] The number you reached is not in service. Disconnected. I spoke with someone, you guys. I swear I did! We believe you. Okay, great. How about I order a round of tequila, huh? Ugh! Not for me. Could I please get a Cosmo? And, do you have anything to eat? We don't got no Cosmos here. We don't got no food here. Maybe tomorrow I could get you some. Well, what about a Black Russian? Could you make that? [yelling] We don't got no fancy kind of drinks here! You want a shot? [quietly] I can give you a shot. I don't know how this happened, you guys. [Chad] It's okay. Let's figure out where we're going to stay tonight. Hey, how about you? Do you know where we could stay? Huh? Hey, I asked you a question! [scoffs] you fucking deaf? As a matter of fact he is. And he's meaner than a junkyard dog. So... if I were you, I'd just leave him alone, huh? Sorry. Yeah. There'll be a tow in the morning. [Mike] That's perfect. Do you think we can get into the hotel tonight and start filming? Maybe even stay there? Are you crazy? You want to go into a haunted hotel, at night? Besides, I thought we were supposed to start tomorrow? That was the plan but it's perfect. And this is why we're here. Oh, I don't-- I don't know. [yelling] Hey Clancy! What do you think? Should we let them stay in the hotel tonight? [laughs] See, I don't like to do that. See, everything in there? It's authentic. Turn of the century. You mean the hotel's still furnished? You're damn right. Well, I'm not staying there. Well, you could stay here on the floor but I gotta warn you, got rats. Oh, my God! -I'm not staying here! -Okay, okay. Well, can we just stay at the hotel? Beds are made. You'd... Have to sleep on top of the sheets I think. You know? And you'd have to promise that nothing got moved or taken. We promise. Well, in that case... since you're from the Discovery Channel and all, you know? That's the key to the front door. Thanks. You're welcome. Now, the lights are off but the fuse box is just down the basement. That's great. We'll take care of everything. I'm sure you will, little angel. You hear any noise... that's just ghosts. I'd advise you... don't go in room 109. [Chad] Really? Why? [Chad] So, what can you tell us about room 109? [yelling] I can tell you to get that camera out of my face, now! Sorry. Can I interview you now? If you stay there, I guess so. So, what can you tell us about room 109? You see, that's... where it all happened. [bartender] She died in room 109. George Winfield, he's... a tough guy. Stern boss. No good son of a bitch! Didn't deserve to be in the same room with Elizabeth! [female whimpering] See, Elizabeth, she-- she was an angel. Did you know her? Oh, no. It was way before my time but... I saw paintings of her. Oh, and she was an angel. Just like you. [bartender] An angel. [Mike] Yeah? I thought she was a whore. She ain't no whore! I'm sorry, sir. Please, excuse him. I'm sure your right. Damn right I'm right! You'll have to excuse me now, little lady, but... This interview is over. We understand. Thank you. Really. You've been a big help. Yeah. Thanks, sir and... thanks for that tip with room 109. You guys have a nice sleep. No hard feelings? I'll be watching you! [Julie] It's kind of freaky how that guy kept calling me his angel. [Mike] Yeah, he's a freak! [Julie] Yeah? well, you ruined our interview with that freak. We're lucky he gave in and gave us a place to stay. [Chad] He said it's furnished. It shouldn't be too bad. [Mike] Yeah. Not too bad with an inch of dust on everything. [whispering] It's time now. [whispering] Time to come. [pst] Jackson! What are you doing here? I love you too much. I can't resist. [baby sounds] I think about you all the time. [baby sounds] Oh, she's so pretty. She's just like her mom. I have something for the little one. Turn around. A keepsake. Someday we'll be together. I love you so much. [whispering] What would you risk for love? -[Dean] It's so cold out here. -[Mike] Oh, man! [Keri] Why did we even stop? [Chad] Hey, Dean. Get the mic. [Dean] All right. [Keri] Oh, my God! [Mike grunts] [Chad] Hey, make sure you shut that door. [Mike chuckles] [Keri] Guys, this place is creepy. [Chad] Check it out! [Mike] What? [Mike chuckles] [Keri] So should we just... find a place to sleep? [Julie] We need the fuse box to turn the lights on. [Chad] No, no, no. Not yet. Let's unpack the gear and I'll go find it. -[Julie] Yeah. -[Mike] Let's find some ghosts! [Julie] I'm going to get an EMS scanner. Keri, will you help me with this? [Keri] Sure. [Chad] Let me film you unpacking the gear. [Julie] All right. Okay. I got it. All right... let's go. [Chad] Let's do it. We could probably sell this on eBay and make a killing. [Dean] Guess what Keri? We're not stealing anything. I didn't say I was going to steal anything! [Dean] Put it back! I didn't take anything! Keri! Put it back! [Keri sighs] You're no fun! Come here Keri. I'm sorry, okay? [loud scream] [Mike laughing] Oh, I got you guys so good! Damn it Mike! Real immature. Man, I gotta be me! I'm going to go look around. This place is too cold. Oh! Come on girl! We got to get the party... all right! [laughs] I know you want some of that. Give me that! At a girl! [Mike] Save some for me! I drooled on myself! [Mike] It's a good look for you. [laughs] [Mike] Let's stay here and get drunk. [both laughing] [Dean] Hello? [Dean] Mike? [Dean] Is that you? I'm gonna kill you. Great, Dean. You walk into a haunted hotel, the first thing you do? Wonder off by yourself. Looks like I just failed haunted house 101. Okay. So I'm a goner. [chuckles] [Chad] The bartender said the breaker is this way. [Julie] There's nothing here. Just keep going. [electronic beeping] Wait! I'm picking up something. It's over there. [strange noises] [beeping] [Julie] I'm getting some crazy readings here. [creepy noise] Wait! It's coming from over there. [female whispers] What have you done with my baby? [Chad] I don't see anything. [Julie] I'm not getting anything anymore. This is where he said the breaker wall should be. Found it! Yeah! [loud female scream] That sounds like Keri. We should probably get back to the lobby. [whispers] Please. [whispers] Please help me find my child. There's nothing wrong. -There's no ghost -[Chad] What the hell happened? -Is everything all right? -Yes. [Mike] Actually what happened is the lobby door slammed shut. Must have been the wind but it scared the crap out of our girl here. I'm sorry, guys. It was really stupid. But it did scare the crap out of me. Hey, we're in a haunted hotel, right? God damn it! -What? -It's like the third -What? -[Julie] Okay, guys. Stop messing around. I gotta do my thesis. Let's go. Let's go film. [Dean] Cool. I gotta get my sound system. Come on. [Mike] So, did you guys see any freaky shit downstairs? [Julie] Not really. [Julie] To be honest, we got some crazy readings in the basement. [Mike] Do you think there are some capers down there or what? [Julie] I hope so. That's what we're here for. [Mike] Damn straight! Damn straight. [Dean] And then there was light. [Mike laughs] -[Chad] Dang. -[Mike] Oh man. -You want to start shooting? -Yeah. [Chad] Did you get anything yet? No. It's really faint. My God. If we really see a ghost we'll freak! [Chad chuckling] Come on, ghosts can't hurt you. [Keri] How do you know? -[Chad] I don't. -[Keri] great! [Mike] I ain't afraid of no ghosts! Maybe we should try the basement again. Isn't that where you said you saw something when you and Chad went to flip the breaker? [Keri] Look guys, I'm like starving! [Keri] Can we just eat first? [Mike] Seriously. I could use some chow. Hey, Jules. What do you say? [Julie] Yeah. Sure. I guess so. [Julie] Come on, over here. [Mike] She's been obsessing about this for over a year now. [Julie] I wasn't obsessing. It's just a fascinating story. [Chad] It's pretty cool! [Keri] Well, let's hear it. [Julie] Okay. Well, it was about this woman. She was very beautiful. She caught the eye of the owner of the hotel, George Winfield. She became, sort of, like a kept woman. [Keri] So why didn't he marry her? [Julie] He was already married. [Mike] Damn! A pervert and a player! [Keri] Oh, my God. Man suck! -[Mike laughs] -[Dean] What? [Julie] So it's about this time that she became pregnant and George pressured her to get what was then an illegal abortion. Elizabeth... refused. And even though they no longer shared intimacies George didn't want her to be anyone else's. He wanted her to be his own kept woman. Well, that was until he found out the truth. What was the truth? She betrayed him. Elizabeth had fallen in love with another man by the name of Jackson Smith. He was a bartender who worked in the hotel and the baby was actually his. [Julie] So George was outraged. [Julie] He was not going to let some servant girl make a fool of him. [Keri] So what did he do? Well... when Jackson Smith was out of town and he was trying to figure out an escape for her, Elizabeth and himself, George... took Elizabeth into room 109, tied her up... shackled her... and tortured her. The more she begged and pleaded the more outraged and cruel he became. And then he took the baby, murdered it... and threw the corpse down the mine shaft under the hotel. [whispering] Please, don't! [Julie] So Elizabeth is said to roam the halls and has to relive her death by the hands of George Winfield every night for all eternity. -[Mike scoffs] -[Keri] Oh, my God. She's said to roam the halls in search of her baby, crying "where's my baby? Where's my baby?" [Mike chuckling] Elizabeth! [Elizabeth whispers] Now you can't leave either! [Dean] Now that is a good story! Yeah. Well, that's why we're here. Right? So... should we go find some ghosts? [Dean] Hey, let's do it! To ghost hunting! [panting] [Julie] Oh... [Dean] What? [Julie] I don't know. The readings are going crazy! [Mike] What do you mean? [Julie] Well, one second there's nothing and then and then the next needle hits the top. [Dean] What's that mean? [Julie] I'm not sure. Yeah! [Julie] It's like there's a door opening and closing. [Chad] Hey, remember what we read about seven portals. [Julie] Yeah. Weren't the readings consistent with portals opening or closing? What? What's a portal? What are you talking about? [Julie] There's supposedly seven portals to the other side. I'm doing my thesis on Goldfield Hotel because it's-- it's one of the portals. That's why there's so much supernatural activity here. Wait a minute. So we may have found a doorway where the dead can come and go into our world? [Julie] Possibly. [laughs] Get the fuck out of here! [Dean] Hang on, hang on! If there's some a doorway to the afterlife why doesn't Elizabeth just go back through? I don't know. Maybe she can't. [Chad] Maybe she's stuck here looking for her baby. Being killed over and over again. Night after night. Hey! Where were you? Nowhere. What did you take? Nothing. Come on. [Chad] Hey, you guys think we should check out the mine shaft? [Keri] Are you crazy? [Julie] No. Let's just... Let's just check out the rest of the hotel. [Julie] Come on. Mike, stop goofing off. [Mike chuckling] What? [Mike] Come on, let's take the portal. Anything? [Julie] I don't know yet. [Dean] I felt something here earlier. [Julie] Really? [Dean] Yeah. [Dean] It was like I wasn't alone. You know? Baby! Stop it! You're freaking me out. [Mike] You guys think this bar has a happy hour? You know? Quarter beers? Jello shots? N- no? Yeah. Probably not. Hey guys! I think I'm getting something. Chad! [loud strange noises] It's coming from over there. This is our first glimpse of the Goldfield Hotel. Originally built by George Winfield in 1903, it was one of the most luxurious hotels between Chicago and San Francisco. Now, it's just another abandoned property off the I-ninety-five. The only residents here... are the abandoned souls of guests who used to stay here. This is the Jack Dempsey dinning room. -[whispers] Closer. -[Chad] Ghost! [whispers] You're not alone anymore! [Sara] Mister Winfield. I am writing to tell you about an illicit affair between Elizabeth and Jackson Smith. The baby is not yours. [Elizabeth whispers] Where is my baby? [Chad] Julie? [Chad] Julie! Keep filming. [Keri] Well, what is it? -She's here. -[Mike] Who? [Mike] Who? I don't see anyone. Elizabeth. She's here. She passed right through me. [Mike] I don't know. I didn't see anything. [Chad] I saw her in the lens but when I looked she was gone. She was there. [Chad] Right there! See? -[Mike] W- where? -[Keri] Don't see anything. [Chad] Right there! That's her head! [Chad] Those are arms! [Dean] I don't know. It could be. [Mike] Could be anything. [Chad] I swear! I saw her as clear as I'm seeing you, man! [Keri] It's so blurry. Chad? Scared the shit out of me! How can you not see it? -[Mike] It could be whatever. -Chad! Let's check everything we shot. [Mike] Here you go. I'm sorry. [Chad] What the fuck? [Mike] What? [Chad] Shit. Hold on. Shit! There's-- I don't-- I don't get this! [Mike] What is it? [Chad] There's nothing-- we have nothing! -Are you sure? -What? Everything we've shot is static except what you just saw! -It's bullshit. -It's all snow. What'd you do? Well... how can that be? I don't know. Julie, I was rolling on everything. -Well... -Then what happened? -[Chad scoffs] -What is it? Hang on. I'm hearing something. [Chad] This doesn't make sense. -Wait, this-- -Hold on. Hold on. I definitely hear something. Is it possible to get audio with no video? It could. It wasn't programmed to do that. We all saw what we were just looking at. [Dean] Whoa! -[Mike] What do you hear? -[Keri] Dean? If there's an image I thought there would be audio even with no video. Okay? I boosted the bass, cut the treble. I definitely heard something. I then put a low pass filter on it. This is what I heard. [female whisper] "Where is my baby?" [Keri gasps] Oh my God! [female whisper] "Where is my baby?" [Dean] Chad! [Dean] I know what I heard! I don't know. Maybe it's one of Mike's stupid pranks. [Mike] No. No. No. That one was not mine! And I don't know what I'm doing with that high end low frequency and stuff. I don't know. -He's right. -[Mike] Besides, this ghost stuff is a bunch of bullshit. -No! [Mike] You guys are really-- It was her. I felt her! Okay? Chad heard her! We all heard her! It was Elizabeth. And I've heard it before. Those words. Those same words. [Chad] When? In the cemetery. I-- I... I thought it wasn't really happening. Thought it wasn't real but it was. [Julie] It's Elizabeth. [Chad] Okay. [Chad] It's Elizabeth. [Chad] That's why we came here, right? [Dean] Yeah. I guess. We should be happy, right? -Yeah. -[Chad] And we got ourselves a real ghost on film. God damn it! That's-- that's crazy! Here's to us, for getting the ghost on film, huh? Okay guys. Let's just take a look at everything we shot. Maybe we got more weird stuff... [loud supernatural noises] maybe entice it to make another appearance? [Chad] All right. Well, if you guys don't need me I think I'm going to go down to the bar and just pretend that I'm not in a ghost hotel. -[Chad] Sounds good to me! -[Dean] Are you in? Oh! I am in! [Dean] Keri? [Keri scoffs] Fine. [Dean] All right. [Dean] See you guys in a bit. [Keri] Where are we going now with an angry ghost-- Stop it! -[Mike chuckles] -[Keri] It's not funny anymore. [Mike] Sorry, ghosts only tickle you. [Keri gasps] Oh my God! Guys! [Mike laughs] [Keri] You know I'm ticklish! That's a nice necklace. Thanks. What's inside the locket? Uhm, it's just an old picture. Of? [chuckles] I always thought it was my grandmother. You don't think that anymore? I don't know. Okay. Explain the whole "I felt Elizabeth as she passed right through me" bit. I know it sounds crazy. Not as crazy as anything else we are doing here, right? I just-- I feel everything in this place. I see things. I see-- I see Elizabeth and I see George, and Jackson Smith. It's like they were-- it's like I'm right there with them. I can't really explain it. Okay. Well your grandma worked here, right? So that's a distant connection. So at least there's a connection there somewhere. So you're especially attuned to this place. That's it. I mean if I can believe in ghosts I sure as hell can believe in all of that. Thanks. You always know what to say. Yeah. I'm great like that. [Julie giggles] So, what do you say we scare up some more ghosts? Are you sure? Yeah. We can always look at this footage but we'll only be here a couple days. We might as well get some stuff on film. You're the boss. Let's do it. [Dean laughing] Chad said something different but I don't know. It went too fast. -[Chad] Not that funny, Mike -[Keri laughing] -Yo! Lady Producer! -[Julie] Hi honey. -Ready to find Elizabeth? -Sounds good! [Keri] Okay but I'm telling you I don't want to go back in that room. It's like totally scary. Well, you don't have to then. You can hang out here or hang out in the room. Uhm... no! I'm not gonna be by myself. Okay. You're being a little difficult. -[Chad chuckles] -[Keri] I don't care! This place is totally freaking me out! You don't need to be. [Mike] You need me chasing ghosts with you? No. I mean, we're okay. All right. So we're cool. I'm going to stay here with Keri you go get your work done. Everybody happy? Sounds good to me. So, we're cool? Sweetie? Okay. I'm sorry. I don't mean to be such a pain. It's okay. Everybody's used to it. [chuckles] Come on Chad. Let's go grab some stuff. Catch some ghosts. See you soon! All right Keri dog! In order to keep this party moving we're going to... Ah! have to head upstairs and make a little excursion to continue on with our libation. Lead on! [giggles] What kind of hotel doesn't have cable T.V.? [Mike] I know. Seriously. We could be watching pay per view porno right now. [Keri chuckles] Oh my God! -You're so gross! -[Mike chuckles] [Julie] A little while ago in this room we had a first encounter with resident ghost Elizabeth Walker. We don't know the significance of this room. Maybe this is where George Winfield first learned of her unfaithfulness? Or maybe just a room that Elizabeth particularly liked. But last time we were here temperature dropped considerably. Now there's-- there's nothing on the EMF scanner. No ghostly activity. I'm not getting anything. I know. Last time we could feel her presence. So, where to next? Just cut to the chase. Let's go to room 109. [Keri] Whoa! Whoa! [Keri] Slow down! I can handle it. I can handle it just fine. Thank you. That is true! [giggles] Hey! [Keri] Can't you share? Come on! -[Mike chuckles] -[Keri squeals] I keep doing that! [Mike laughing] Yeah, that's a really good look for you. [Dean] It's so dark down here. [Dean] Here, let's go down this hallway. [beeping] [Julie] It's her! [Julie] Oh, my God! Oh my God! It's her! [Chad] Where's she taking us? [whispering] Come to me if you dare! [Julie] Follow her! [Dean] Chad, get out the camera. [Chad] What the heck is that? [Julie] It's a real ghost. [Julie] Where's she going? [Julie] I think that's Elizabeth. [Julie] Chad, are you getting this? [whispering] Come to me. [Julie] Hey guys, where do you think she's leading us? -[Mike chuckles] -[Keri] You're such a spazz! [Mike] You know... you're really hot! [Keri giggles] Well, duh! I'm serious. -[Keri] Really? -Yeah. [giggles] [Dean] Did you guys see the same thing that I saw down there? [Chad] Holy shit, guys! [Dean] Wait until Keri and Mike hear about this. Whoa! It's cold. Whoa! It's freezing. I think something's happening. You should film. You got it, boss! [Julie] Hey. What you think happened there? Did we do that? [beeping] [Chad] That door ain't always been opened. Jesus. It's freezing in here. [Keri giggles] You're such a spazz! [Keri moans] [Keri moans louder] [Mike] Are you all right? How hot am I? [Mike chuckles] You're really hot! [Mike] Very hot! Everyone knows that Keri! Show me. [beeping] Should have been mine. Why'd you do it, Sara? Why'd you do it? Jackson. [Sara] Don't know what you're talking about. Why did you do it? I didn't do anything. I don't know what you mean. Don't lie! Not here in her room! Why? You're drunk. Yes. I am drunk. [Jackson] And you know why? Because that bastard, Winfield, killed my beautiful Elizabeth. And he killed my two week old baby. How could you kill something so innocent? [Jackson] So perfect? Were you jealous that I wouldn't come to your bed? Is that why you want to hurt me so much? Get out! A curse on you! A curse on you and your whole family! From this time onward May God forgive you because I never will! A curse on you! A curse on you and your whole family! [Chad] Julie? [Chad] Julie? It's my fault. It's my fault that Elizabeth and that baby died. [Dean] What? What are you talking about? I saw something that I never should have seen. Help me get her back to the room. [Dean] Okay. -[Keri breathing heavily] -[Mike moans] [moaning] [moaning intensifies] [Julie gasps] Jesus Christ! [moaning] What the hell, Keri? Oh! I don't know! Wait! -[Keri cries] -Keri! -I don't even know-- -Shut up! Know what? You're always flirting! Always saying stuff. I always thought You know what? That's just Mike! I didn't-- Oh, fuck! We really know how to pick them! -[Chad] Let's call it-- -I don't even-- Why the hell would you do that to me? You don't understand! I don't know what happened! We were sitting here talking, drinking-- And you just accidentally slipped inside of her? You're such an asshole! Dude! You got to believe me! I swear we were just talking and I- I- It was the weirdest thing ever! Yeah. Sure. Okay. I know it sounds weird and I'm kind of drunk but it was not her! It was like it was someone else! [Mike] Okay? Mike! Stop drinking! Okay? Do that. Please? Chad! Come on! You gotta believe me! Make sure Jules is okay! Oh, fuck. [sighs] [Keri panting] Oh, my God! Keri! [Keri panting] [Keri crying] [busy dial tone] Oh, my god! [Chad] Julie? Please just don't try to defend him. I'm not trying to. He's such an asshole. Yeah. He is an asshole but I don't think he's this big of an asshole, do you? I didn't think so. And with Keri? I mean how could this happen? It's this place. The hotel is doing things to us. I saw Elizabeth. I saw my grandmother betray Elizabeth. But it wasn't her. It was me. What else did you see? I saw my grandmother flirting with [sniffs] with Jackson Smith and I saw her spying on Elizabeth. Spying on them being intimate. [sniffs] But it wasn't-- it wasn't them. It was me! Fuck you guys. This is bullshit! Fucking whore! [whispering] Michael? [Mike] Come out you fucking ghosts! [whispering] Come to me Michael. [whispering] Michael? [Keri] Oh, God. [Keri squealing scared] [whispering] You're first. [Keri] Dean? [Keri screaming] Dean! It was me. It was me who... betrayed them. It was me who killed them. Julie. Julie, you've gotta stop this! It wasn't you! All right? It was your grandmother. You're connected to this place but it's not your fault. You didn't kill them. This locket is Elizabeth's. Jackson Smith gave it to her. This is their baby. My grandmother stole it after she was dead. That's why she doesn't want us in Goldfield. She's ashamed. I'm ashamed. I'm ashamed to be a part of this whole thing. Whoa! Whoa! Wait! Wait! Wait! Don't you see? You have a chance to make things right with Elizabeth. We can give her her locket and the picture of her baby. I mean I don't know. Maybe-- maybe I'm way off base here but... we can give Elizabeth the peace she deserves. Chad, how are you so smart? It's a curse I guess. Instead of the looks and the charm I got brains. I can live with it, right? Yeah. You're the whole package. I always knew that. I was just too stupid to do anything about it. Julie? I've cared about-- [Dean] Keri! [Keri] Dean! [Keri gasps] [Keri] Dean! [Keri] Please find me! [Keri] Dean? [Dean] Keri! [Keri] I'm here! Come get me! [Dean] Keri? Where the hell are you? [Keri] Dean? [Keri] Dean? [Keri panting] Dean! [crying] [Keri screams] Keri! I'm coming! [whispering] You're first. [Keri screams] [whispering] Do you like me? You're not George! [Elizabeth] How do you like this, Michael? Oh, God. [coughs] You're not Jules. Where is everyone? -[Elizabeth] Michael. -Hey, guys! [Elizabeth] Come to me, Michael. Oh shit! [Elizabeth] Michael. You want a drink? No? Whoa! Whoa! Hey! I don't fuck dead chicks, all right? No, seriously. I mean it. Just go on. Go find your dead baby or some shit. Scram! [groaning] [Dean] Keri? Was that the hotel too? That was-- that was all me. I've been wanting to do that for as long as I've known you. [Dean] Chad! Julie! [Julie screeches] -I found her backpack. -[Julie] My God! We were yelling at each other and now she's gone. I don't know where. Let's check on Mike! [Julie screams] [Dean] All right. [Chad] Dean! No! We need to stick together! Wait! Damn it! Dean! [Chad] We need to go get him! [Julie] No! Wait! Julie! We have to go help him find Keri! Wait! Okay, maybe we need to do something else right now! What? If it's Elizabeth, we need to stop her. How are we going to do that? Maybe it's like you said? Maybe if we give her... the locket she will be at peace? Maybe it's not! We have to try. Maybe this is all part of my family. I have to do this. Okay. What do we do? [Julie] Room 109. Come on. Sure you want to do this? I have to. What did you do to her, you bitch! Show yourself! [Elizabeth] Yes. [Elizabeth] Yes. [Elizabeth] Yes. [Elizabeth] Dean. You're next! [Dean yelling] Chad? Julie!

[Chad] Where she died. [Julie] Elizabeth? Elizabeth, I have something for you. It's rightfully yours. Please take it and just leave us alone? [gasps in dismay] Here's your baby, bitch! [Elizabeth gasps] You cheap Bitch! Come here! Cheap Bitch! What have I done Elizabeth? I love you. I've always loved you! But that wasn't good enough! You made me, George Winfield, look like a dope! [Windfield] You're going to die. [Elizabeth crying loudly] You're going to die. [grunting] [Windfield] You're gonna die. [Elizabeth screams] No! George! I never want to be in that room again. What should we do? I don't know. Elizabeth can't be freed. What do you mean? I can't imagine the-- the cruelty she went through. The-- that night at the hands of George Winfield. All I saw was revenge. What do we do now then? Keri! [Elizabeth] Who are you looking for? [Elizabeth] Keri? [Elizabeth] Want some head Dean? [screams] [grunts] [screams] [Julie] Let's find them and go. -What if we don't find them? -Then we get help! -Dean! -[Julie screams] [Chad] Dean! [Chad] Dean! [Chad] Come on! [Julie continues screaming] Oh my God! [Chad] Keri! Come on! [Julie] Please, help us! [Julie] Please! [Chad panting] Let's find another way. [Julie screams] [Elizabeth growling] [Elizabeth] Where's my baby? I can do this. It's my fault. This is all my fault. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. I don't know. Elizabeth? [Julie] I'm here. [Julie] Come out. [Elizabeth whispering] Where's my baby? [Elizabeth whispers] Where's my baby? I'm who you want, aren't I? [whispering] Where's my baby? [Julie] I'm the one who betrayed you. Well I have something that you want. [Elizabeth whispers repeatedly] Where's my baby? [Elizabeth] My baby! This is what you've been searching for isn't it? Well, I have it. and as long as I have it, you can't touch me, can you? [Julie] So you killed the others because you couldn't get to me. I know that you're trapped here where you relive your death. I know that this will free you. Just go! Don't hurt anyone else. [gasps] [Julie screams] [Elizabeth] Where's my baby? [Elizabeth] Where's my baby? [Julie] No! No! Get away! Get away from me! Why won't you get away? [Elizabeth] He will come for you now. [Julie] Stay away! Stay away from me! [Julie] Let me go! [Julie] Please stay away! [Julie] Stay away from me! [Julie] Help me! Help me! Help me! [Sophie] Chad! Chad! My hands. Hurry! She'll be back in a minute. Please, Chad! I loved you. That wasn't good enough! [Julie] Please! Shut up. Do you think you and that bartender are going to make a fool of George Winfield? I own this hotel! That bastard worked for me! You betrayed me Elizabeth. [Julie gagged and screaming] I'm going to make sure you never see him again. [Elizabeth screaming] [gagged screaming] [Julie laughing hysterical] [Narrator] By the 1908 mining companies were making billions and the city flourished. George Winfield, the largest of the mining owners. One of the most politically influential men of his day decided to build the Goldfield Hotel. Considered the most spectacular of its kind in Nevada, it boasted an elevator and running hot water in every room. Over time, gold declined and people began to leave Goldfield. By the time the depression hit the hotel had fallen on hard times and was little more than a flop house for cowboys and the indiscriminate traveller. It was one stormy night in 1935 that truly changed its history forever. Legend has it that night put a curse on the hotel. One thing is known for sure. The Goldfield Hotel has been closed ever since.
