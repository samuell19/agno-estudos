The Iowa, greatest warship ever launched, christened by Mrs. Henry Wallace, wife of the vice president. 1 used to play a game with my dad. He was a captain, a captain of a submarine. “What's the best ship on the seven seas?” he would ask. 1 always said, “A battleship.” It wasn't a slap at him. 1 love my father. Alll had to do was say the word, he would have pulled every string in the book to get me on a sub. But I didm't want that. Because when there's trouble around the world, what is the first thing the Pentagon does? They send in the battleships. “Point of the sword,” is what my father calls it. That's where a warrior wants to be... Inharm's way, defending the world. That's what a battleship does. And of all the battleships on the ocean, none was finer than the U.S.S. Iowa. From World War 1, fighting the Japanese at Saipan and Hokkaido, to supporting our troops against the North Koreans at Kojo, the Iowa was the place to be when the world was on fire. So when I finally got a chance to be assigned to her... and move up to command my own 16-inch gun turret, it was a dream come true. You might wanna try some ear protection, sir. I've been around guns before. I'll be fine. All right. Suit yourself. Then we use these scuttles to transfer the powder into the powder hoist. The scuttles help us isolate the powder... in case there's a problem in the magazine. It won't affect the powder handling room. The powder's put on the hoist. Each gun room has its own separate hoist. Once it's on the hoist, it travels up through the two projectile decks... to the gun room above. Down below here, I've got a primer man. He's gonna stick a 30-caliber round into the breech. That's what we use to trigger the detonation. The cradle operator lines up the tray. This way we can load the shell... and then the powder into the gun. The gun captain synchronizes everything. The loading and the firing. The first three bags come down. Easy, easy. Two go back, one goes forward. - Is that asoda can? - Yeah, it's a soda can. I bet they don't teach you that in the academy. - The powder door is reliant on a soda can? - Yeah. What am I gonna do? I can't find spare parts unless I cannibalize another battle... Then cannibalize one. I don't want this turret running on soda cans. Yes, sir. I'll see what I can do. Ass-wipe. Turret One, center gun, ready and loaded. Exercise complete. Secure from gunnery. Restow all gear. Ensign Meyer, this is Gunner's Mate Timothy Sykes. Uh, Mr. Meyer was running a five-incher. But now this Is his new flome. Welcome to Turret One, sir. Loading crew to Turret Three. Ensign Meyer reporting, sir, as ordered, Well, at ease, Mister. - You know Gunner's Mate Williams? - Yes, sir! Gunner's Mate Williams here was All-American two years ago. Best wide receiver in the country. Why he gave up a pro career to serve under me, I'll never know. Well, the Iowa is a legend, sir. That's why, uh, you applied for duty here? "Cause the /owa's alegend?" Yes, sir. Well, I'd have thought that, uh, you'd apply for... for a sub. - Your dad commanded a sub, didn't he? - Yes, sir. - I do better on the surface than under water. - Why not a carrier? Couldn't your old man and some of his pals get you a berth on a carrier? Well, sir, I'm not a pilot. There's no future on a carrier for an officer who doesn't fly. Ah. So basically, you're, uh... you're here by default. No, sir. I wanted the /owa. She's the “Point of the Sword.” My, my, my. Ensign Meyer says... that the battleship Is the “Point of the Sword.” So, as a, um... As asmart man, I assume... - that you made some inquiries about your new captain. - Sir? What is the first thing that I expect from my officers? Loyalty, sir. - And second? - Loyalty, sir. - And third? - Loyalty, sir. Were you satisfied with your dry run practice in Turret One? Well, sir, sixteen-inch guns are certainly trickier than five-inch guns. Mister, were you satisfied with your dry run practice in Turret One? - Yes, sir. - So your, uh, turret... will be ready for a live fire exercise next month. Il be ready, sir. - Fine. Dismissed. - Aye, sir. So she says to me, “If you don't buy me the ring, I'm gone.” - So what did you say? - / say. “Carole, honey, for the price of that ring, I could buy a Camaro.” Or something like that. Twenty. Maybe not those exact words. You could do worse. You could get stuck with a Caprice. - Where's my money, Bob? - Next payday. - Next payday? - Next payday, Ken. Guaranteed. So you wanna extend your loan? Don't do this. I'm not gonna stiff you. I'm gonna pay you back every damn nickel. A week ago, you borrowed 200 bucks. - My rate is 50% a week. As of today... - Hey! Hey! Hey! Officer on deck. - Who are you, sailor? - Gunner's Mate Robert Dolan, sir. Gunner's Mate Kendall Truitt, sir. - Gunner's Mate Clayton Hartwig, sir. - They're all from Turret Two. - Did I just witness an assault? - No, sir. - I did not just witness an assault? - No, sir. Then what did I just witness, Gunner"s Mate Hartwig? A demonstration, sir. Dolan wanted Truitt to show him a judo move. Yes, sir. A judo move. Dolan wanted to learn a judo move. Truitt was showing me one of his moves, sir. Next time tell a better lie, or keep your mouth shut. If I ever catch you loan-sharking the men in Turret Two, I'll kick your ass. I can't wait to get out there tonight. Clubs, restaurants, food. - Real food. - Ihear that. - I am sick of navy chow. - Boy, you're gonna be eating tonight. I mean, Norfolk is swimming with cooz. Simms found this massage parlor, man. If you're into that kind of thing. Anybody need money for tonight? - Keep your money. - Make sure you talk to me before you hit the beach. Screw off. Man. I'm not saying you need to pay for it. But if you want to. Remember I told you about Carole, her wanting aring? What about it? I wasn't exactly straight with you, Clay. We got married in December. - What? - It was a spur-of-the-moment thing. Clay, we just went and did it. Hey, guys. Ken just got married. - Hey! - Just went and did it. "Cause he didn't want any witnesses at the scene of the crime." Congratulations. What's he so pissed off about? Oh. Ensign Meyer. Hey, this is Senior Chief Reggie Ziegler. He's from Turret Two. Reggie, this is our new ensign. This is Dan Meyer. - How you doing? - Senior Chief. - You want a beer? - I don't drink with enlisted men. And I don't want to see alcohol in my turret. Okay. What can I do for you? - We have a live shoot coming up? - We're gonna be ready. 0700 Monday morning, in my office, I want a detailed report... of everything that's wrong with this turret. Equipment, training, everything. - And then? - And then we see that it's fixed. You think I'd be here busting my ass on my own time... if there was any other way to get this stuff done? I don't wanna hear complaints. I wanna hear solutions. Oh. Okay. I-I got a lot of solutions. I- need a new air compressor so I can clean out the gun barrels. 1 got to replace all the hydraulics 'cause I'm leaking 60 gallons a week. I couldn't have a more out-of-date control panel. 1 got a lot of solutions. The problem is, there's no money. Any time they get spare cash, where does it go? - To a new cruise missile. Right, Ziggie? - Right. Or some... some kind of fancy targeting computer. It doesn't come here. - Does the captain know about the condition of the turret? - Moosally? No. I don't believe he's ever been in this turret. Please. He"s never been in any turret. Word is, the captain is... He's afraid of the big guns. Let me give you some advice. That's not a wise habit, making disparaging remarks about your superior officers. It gets back to them. Aye, aye, sir. - 0700, Monday morning. - Aye, aye, sir. Mortenson's a good man. I'm sure he is. But his attitude stinks. WWell, just say the word, son. I'll have you in a sub in 72 hours. That's not the kind of help I need. I go on asub, no matter what I do, I'm Don Meyer's son. - Well, it could be worse. - You know what I mean. I have to make it on my own. - What else do you wanna know? - I know battleships aren't your area of expertise, but... if I wanted to make an impression, what would you advise? - What's your captain like? - Fred Moosally. Barely knows I'm alive. Yeah, well, I've heard of him. He's the kind of guy who... Well, let's just say he knows his way around. Just give Aim the results he can boast about, he'll haul you up the ladder with him. How's your ship? She's a mess. Old parts barely holding on. No money for repairs. Pretty much anything that can go wrong with a 50-year-old ship. Besides that, she's a grand old dame. - Who knows all this? - Everybody. Yeah, but who knows it officially? You gotta write a memo. Put it all down, every detail. Don't be a whiner and go to the captain. Go through your chain of command. And do it soon. - Thanks, honey. - Mm-hmm. Do you want me to take my top offinone? I appreciate the offer, but I just wanna get a shot of the two of us for the guys. Look, baby, I like you. I've never been with an officer before. - I'm not an officer. - We don't even need to get a room. My car's out back. I got avan. Look, we're sailing tomorrow. You don't want me here tonight and... Thank you. Mr. Meyer? Master Chief Skelley, sir. You got a second? So you probably know that I'm the liaison... between gunnery headquarters and the Jowa. I run the experimental shoots on board, sir. - What can I do for you, Master Chief? - Well, sir, everyone knows... that you and Mort operate a great turret, and I figured maybe I could persuade you to become my R and D shop. What did you have in mind? Well, sir, could you maybe do a D-840 shoot for us... during the upcoming live fire exercises? - Along-range shoot? - Yes, sir. Very long-range. The idea would be to go for a record. It'd impress the hell out of the brass, sir. - We're talking about setting a record? - That would be the idea, sir. - We're talking about setting a record? - That would be the idea, sir. - You up for it? - Tell me where to sign. That's... That's great. I'll just leave that with you, sir. - Thank you. - Why me? I'm the least senior guy here. Well, sir, you're the only lieutenant who doesn't owe me one... and I'm just covering my bases. You go places, you remember who your friends are. It's just the way it is. It's open'! - Petty Officer Mortenson. - Sir. Master Chief Skelley wants Turret One to do an experimental shoot. - Would that be a problem? - What kind of experimental shoot? D-840. Long-range shoot. He said you run a great turret. - He wants to make it his regular R and D shop. - Not a Delta-846 five-bag? He only said D-840. He said we could set arecord for distance. You object to that? Well, sir, I object to any experimental shoots, especially if Master Chief Skelley is behind them. Well, apart from your opinion of Master Chief Skelley, are there any reasons Turret One shouldn't do the shoot? Apart from you wanting to set a long-range record, are there any reasons we should, sir? The turret will set the record. Bearing: 0-7-5 degrees. Range: 45,000 yards. - Turret One guns loaded and ready to fire. - On my mark. Three, two, one. Mark. Boom. [Over PA. I Red Dog, this is Big Leader. Gunnery complete. Out. - Sir. - Thank you. Turret One scored six direct hits... on a target which was located 48,000 yards from the Iowa. That is 6,000 yards farther than any hit ever achieved by a battleship. Mr. Meyer, extend my congratulations to the men of your turret. I'll be notifying the CN.O. of this exercise, and.. - Well done all around. - Thank you, sir. Well done. You're missing the point, Ben. If you don't find new ways to shoot the big guns, it's freakin” over. The missile guys win. Good-bye 16 inches. Good-bye battleships. Hell, good-bye our navy. The navy will be the damn air force. And it don't have to be that way... because those guns are better than missiles. How can you listen to this crap? I"m sorry. I forgot. I'm sitting with the leader of men, - holder of the 16-inch... - Putacorkinit, will ya? It's cool thing to put on a resume. Milk it for all it's worth. But don't take it seriously. I don't think you'd complain if you had that record. - Hey, Lieutenant, Clay's buying. - What's happening, Ken? Clay got approved for a job in London guarding the ambassador. No more turret duty. The embassy, not the ambassador. Same thing. What are you guys having? - When are you leaving? - I'm just waiting for the orders. I hope they come before we ship out. Hey, Kristy! Kristy! Kristy! What's with her? Oh. I'm making a run over to the shipyard tonight. I hear the Kennedy's got some O-rings for our air compressor. I got some trigger parts that they want. You need anything? Let me see what I have to trade before you go over. Alll can say is, in seven months, I got my 20 years. I'm going home to Sharon and put my size 12s up on the coffee table for good. - Great. - 1t's a hell of a way to run a ship. Damn straight. - We do pretty good last time? - Are you kidding? We did great. I got another for ya. Better. This one shows that the guns can match surface-to-surface missiles. - Let me see. - Gunnery figured it out. We use five bags of D-846 to fire 2,700-pound projectiles, and every missile cruiser in our group will eat our dust. Sir, this is the kind of shoot that can make history. Vice Admiral Johnson will be aboard. He's commander of the Second Fleet. This is a big, big deal. Did you say five bags of D-846? Sir, I don't know what Petty Officer Mortenson told you, but I didn't let you down on the long-distance shot, sir, did I? I'll talk to him. Sir, we don't need his permission to do an experimental shot. I'm not going to ask his permission, Master Chief. I'm gonna talk to him. Master Chief Skelley said with this experimental shoot, Turret One will match a surface-to-surface missile. Five-bag, heavy projectile shoot? - Five bags of Delta-846 powder and a 2,700-pound projectile? - That's right. - And I'll bet he told you it'll make history too. - That's right. What's your point? I don't wanna make history with Master Chief Skelley. - Well, I do. - We're not supposed to use the Delta-846 powder... with a heavy projectile, sir. You objected to Skelley's last shoot. And now we've got the long-range record. Petty Officer Mortenson, I don't need your permission to do this shoot. You're right. You don't need my permission. You could order me to do it. - Is that what you're gonna do? - Don"t want to. - I want us to work together. - Mr. Meyer, for the record, I think a Delta-846 heavy projectile shoot is hazardous. So if you want us to work together, you should tell Skelley to get someone else. Stand by for live fire exercises. Man your battle stations. Hey, thanks for saying no to Skelley. Lost your nerve, huh, Meyer? Well, don't worry about it. Hey, uh, can you spell “promotion”? Damn! Hartwig. Sorry, pal. Get your ass in the center gun room. - I'm not on the duty roster, Senior Chief. - We got a lot of new guys. This is their first live fire shoot. I need some know-fow in there. Come on, Clay! Get a move on'! - [Man Over PA. I Range clear. - Morning, Mr. Meyer. Good morning, sir. We've called away gunnery stations. - I expect we should be manned and ready in a couple of minutes. - Very well, Mr. Meyer. - 1t's all yours, Mr. Gil. - Very well. I swear, whenever we do one of these shoots, all I can think about is a beautiful woman and a juicy steak. - Well, I wouldn't go that far, sir. - No, it's true. That's why I come on these shoots whenever I can. There's no other feeling like it in the world... when those 16 inches start rocketing. You, uh, shoot par at Pebble Beach. That, uh, sounds like a pretty good feeling to me. Christ, we're gonna have to make you an admiral... just so you and I can play a round together. After all, that wouldn't be right, me losing to a captain, would it? Well, it, uh... it would be my pleasure to kick a fellow admiral's butt, sir. Man up all five-inch mounts. Secondary plot. Turrets One, Two and Three. Man up all five-inch mounts. Secondary plot. Turrets One, Two and Three. - Here he comes, sir. - Truitt. Nice of you to make an appearance. Sorry about that, Senior Chief. Gun Control on the line. All stations report when you are manned and ready. Gun Control, Turret Two manned and ready. - Turret One. Left, center and right guns. One round. Load. - Aye, sir. Easy. Good. Left gun loaded, sir. Center gun loaded and ready, sir. Right gun loaded, sir. Turret One ready to fire, sir. On my mark. Three, two, one. Mark. Uh, this is Turret One. I have a misfire in the left gun. Get in there... and let me know what's going on. - Mr. Gil. - Forward main plot. Fire next salvo. Okay, re-prime that. Just re-prime it. - Turret Three ready to fire. - On my mark. Three, two, one. Mark. Mr. Gil, I want a three-gun salvo from Turret Two. Aye, aye, sir. Turret Two, left, center and right guns, one round. Load. Sir, Turret One is re-primed and ready to fire. Turret Two, are you loading? Turret Two, do you hear me? As fast as we can, sir. - Turret Two? I'm on It, sir. - Mr. Gil. Turret One, stand by. Left gas ejection air. Readly. - Left and right guns are loaded. - Center gun is having trouble. Come on, Zieg! Fix it! What's going on? - We have a flash! Zieg, I have friction here'! - The powder's ignited! - Zieg! - Close the breech... Oh, my God! Sound general quarters. General quarters. All men to your battle stations. All hands, there was an explosion in Turret Two. - Assume the conn. Gimme the wind, please. - Two-five-five, 18 knots. - General quarters! - Left full rudder, come to course 2-5-5, into the wind. Commander, give me the blueprints for Turret Two. We never received them from Gunnery, sir. How in the hell can I contain this fire without schematics? - Request permission to leave Bridge. - Go. This is not a drill. General Quarters. Can the powder now! - What's happening? - They're all dead in there! Hurry! Come on! - Cap it! - Let's get out of here! Help me can this stuff! If it blows, you can't run far enough'! Comeon! Help me! This should cover you for schematics, sir. - Request permission to go below and survey the damage. - Permission granted. Keep those hoses on the turret! Get the kink out of that hose! Come on, boys! Move it! Get water on that center gun! Work as ateam! Let's go! Help us - Hurry up f. Put those on! Quick! Let's get the hell out of here! Aah! Admiral, we have a chopper on-fine... to take you and your staffers back to shore, sir. Thank you, Captain. - Good luck. - Thank you, sir. Ow! - He's dead. - Keep going. Damnit! We gotta get out of here! - No! We gotta dump these powder bags. - No, no! We gotta flood this entire area or the whole ship is gonna explode! These bags are gonna blow up. No, no! Move it! Come on'! There's no time! Bring him through! Bring him through! We need more blood here! Sit down. Sir, we've got multiple powder bags glowing bright red in Turret Two. Flood the magazines, the annular spaces and the powder flats. Aye, aye, sir. Damage Control. Flood magazines. Flood annular spaces. Flood powder flats, Turret Two. Mr. Meyer, are there any casualties? At least ten to twenty in the powder room alone, sir. I want a full count and l.D.s. Aye, sir. Oh, Christ. This is Ziggie. Senior Chief Ziegler. No tags. Dolan. Dolan. Dolan. Oh, God. That's Thompson. Above you. I can't. I can't. This is Price. Matt Price. Price. They never charged... the sprinkler system. What a waste. They didn't stand a chance. None of this would have happened if Stewart and I weren't... I had to impress the brass. If you hadn't stood up to me, this would have been us. Let's just keep going. - Clay Hartwig. - Are you sure? The tattoo. - Sir. - What? Some bodies are immersed in water. We'll need pumps to lower it. We'll need winches, block and tackle. The water in the powder flats is contaminated by oil, sulfur, hydraulic fluid. We're gonna need filters, masks, gloves, all of it. And some nets. Some fishing nets. - And a mallet, club, something like that. - What for? Rigor mortis has set in. We're gonna have to break their arms and legs... - to get "em through the hatches." - Get some men. Gettoit. Yes, sir. What's going on? Sir? Sir, everything in this turret is evidence. - We can't tamper with it. - When we pull in at Norfolk, relatives of the victims are gonna be there. I'll not have 'em see a turret that looks like this. But, sir, we haven't even begun an investigation. - We should at least have the film team down here. - Ensign. You and Petty Officer Mortenson... are gonna see to it that the left and right guns are lowered... to match the center gun... and that this turret is trained upon the ship's center line. Sir; /... 1 don't understand. Everything that you're doing in here is compromising an investigation. That is an order, Ensign. Now, when you're finished, shower and get some rest. Dismissed. - What the hell is that? - We ran out of body bags, sir. - Well, find some. - Yes, sir. - Now! - Yes, sir! Goddamn it. Soldiers don't go home in garbage bags. Ten-hut! Today's been the worst day of my life. Not only as a soldier, but as a human being. A commander is. Supposed to lose men in the line of fire. But like this? There's no sense to it. There's no higher purpose. There's no grand meaning. But I do know that we have to, uh... we have to go on. The best thing we can do for those men is to do our duty. There's going... There's going to be amoratorium on the firing of all 16-inch guns in the fleet... until the navy completes its inquiry. The C.N.O. has ordered that the inquiry will be, and I quote, “an informal one-officer investigation.” Commander Gil will fill you in on what you need to know, if you have any questions. Mr. Gil. Gentlemen, the /owsa will not be conducting a separate on board investigation. It would be inappropriate for any senior officer... to ad\vise you how to answer questions put by the admiral, but we do suggest that you keep your answers short. In fact, you know less than you think about the operation... of either Turret Two or this vessel. Questions? Sir, what is an informal investigation? In an informal investigation, witnesses do not need to be sworrn, they are not advised of their rights, they do not have a lawyer present, and regardless... of what the evidence discloses, they cannot be charged with a crime. I had the impression that JAG policy required a formal panel of admirals to... Your impression is wrong. Larry, we picked you because you once commanded a battleship. And we don't want some condescending fly boy to run this investigation. Anyway, this meeting will strictly be “Hello, good-bye.” The next time you and I talk, it'll be after you're done. Even if I wanted to stick my nose in, the uniform code forbids it. Sol'm, uh... I'm just a spectator here. However, I have every confidence that you will do right by the navy, right by the victims, right by the /owa and her sister battleships. Sir, how would you rank those obligations? Well, Larry, that's up to you, not me. However, if this were on my plate, I'd rank those obligations equal. What's good for the navy is good for the victims. What's good for the victims is good for the /owa. What's good for the /owa is good for the future of all our battleships... and the brave folks who sail them. And I say that as a condescending fly boy. All hands. Anyone with information about the Turret Two explosion... muster outside the ship's Ward Room, schedule interviews. We used to have a sensational center gun captain. Clay Hartwig. But he had a transfer coming, 50 he wasn't on the duty roster. We have him as killed in the blast. Clay shouldn't have been in the turret. Clay should be here. Alive. Lieutenant, they want you in the Ward Room, sir. As far as I know, sir, the research and development program... was exclusively Master Chief Skelley's operation. Are you saying senior officers on board were not aware of it? As far as I could tell, sir, Captain Moosally and the other senior officers let Skelley do his experiments... - without interference or supervision. - Stop the tape. Lieutenant, out in the hallway. - You little snitch. You can't say that. - Sir, I was only answering... Well, the admiral doesn't wanna hear another word about experiments. Goon. Why weren't you in your turret when the explosion occurred? I had bridge duty, sir. Petty Officer Mortenson was more than qualified to act as turret officer. Based on where you found their bodies, do you believe Lieutenant Stewart and Chief Ziegler... were at their posts at the time of the explosion? - Yes, sir. I believe so. - Are you sure? - Yes, sir. I believe so. - Are you sure? You identified them solely by their insignia. Why is that? They were... in pieces, sir. Do you recognize these, Lieutenant? Yes, sir. These are the training records for Turret Two that you requested. What do you make of them? Well, sir, the record-keeping could have been more accurate. No question. Sir, if I may, this is a copy of a memo... that I submitted on October the 23rd, 1988. - Could you summarize it for us? - Uh, Admiral, may I suggest we study the lieutenant's memo later on? We have Lieutenant Meyer here. Let him summarize it for us. Lieutenant, summarize your memo for the admiral. Briefly. I described defects in the hydraulic and sprinkler systems in all three turrets. I described the electrical problems. I described the age and volatility of the powder. I described the shortage of trained men. Is it your contention, Lieutenant, that these conditions led to the explosion in Turret Two? Sir, I don't know exactly... what led to the explosion, but... To whom did you address this memo? - To the gunnery officer of the /owa, sir. - Not the X0.? - No, sir. - Not the captain? No, sir. Sabotage. Admiral Langlett actually said, “Traitorous sailor”? “In the pay of a foreign power.” - Sweet Jesus. - 1t's unbelievable. If 1 asked you to do something for me... What do you have in mind? I don't think Admiral Langlett is looking in the right places. He certainly doesn't wanna know squat about the poor training... or the bad powder or the crappy equipment or Skelley's weird shoots. Why are they doing this? They're protecting the captain. Look, if Langlett can find something like a saboteur, or a Chinese depth charge, or an Iranian missile, that's great. Then Moosally becomes admiral. But what if he doesn't? What if he finds something else? What if it's an accident due to poor maintenance? Then Moosally could kiss his career good-bye. Sir. Your loyalty is all 1 asked. I didn't expect you to do my laundry. I didn't ask you to like me. - I didn't even ask you to respect me. - Sir... This is not just about what's going on my record. This is about keeping the ship going. And we can't do that by scaring the crew. - Sir, I only told the invest... - You're arat. You're a little pissant snitch. There's nothing lower. You think your father would have done this? Betrayed his ship? His captain? Sir, I only described what I saw, what I personally knew to be true. Really? So, telling Admiral Langlett about firing experiments, you don't suppose that was speculation? And about the conditions in Turrets Two and Three? You don't work in those turrets, 50 how the hell would you know? “Alack of training in the weapons department.” I especially appreciate that one. Have you read their examination reports? - I mean, what are the basis of these remarks? - Well, sir... You were explicitly briefed not to speculate, not to guess. You were told to keep your answers factual and short. I was not at that briefing, sir. I was not told of it. Loyalty. That's what you promised me. So, were you lying, Mr. Meyer? Areyou a liar? - No, sir. - Because this goes way beyond disloyalty. - Sir, with all respect... - Which you lack, Lieutenant. Can I count on your loyalty from now on? Y-Yes, sir. If the admiral asks you any more questions, your answers are to be... - Factual and short, sir. - You're not to speculate and you're not to guess. - Do you think you can handle that? - Yes, sir. Good. [ President Bush I Let me say to the crew of Iowa, I understand your great grief. I promise you today we will find out why. [ Moosally 7 ! Remember Turret Two. They were the life, the spirit... and the soul of our ship. And your men are under a different command now, one that knows no rank, only love; knows no danger, only peace. And God bless them all. The navy is conducting an exhaustive internal investigation. In addition, we're being assisted by the F.B.I. crime lab. Why involve the F.B.I.? We're using the F.B.l. exclusively for forensics work on the bodies. As you know, it is very difficult... to identify victims of a large explosion. We're hearing that there were malfunctions on the /owa. Guns breaking down because of age. Could this explain what happened in Turret Two? Is this why the navy has ordered a stand-down... of all 16-inch guns, not just those on the Jowa? The navy ordered a stand-down as a standard precaution until it has a chance... to thoroughly inspect all the guns. In answer to your first question, certainly there are going to be problems on a 45-year-old ship. However, to my knowledge, there was nothing to portend a tragedy of this magnitude. Well, one thing we do know is, based on the way this bulkhead is bowed out here, the explosion definitely started in this gun room. Could their ready/safe board short out as often as ours? Oh. Yeah, I"m sure it did, but they'd never give"em a new one. Could a spark have come from the powder hoist? Uh, the hoist? Yeah. It could have come from the hoist, a board, a switch. It could have come from anywhere. What did you know about Master Chief Skelley's... so-called research and development program? Nothing. I, uh... I was shocked and incensed when I heard about it. So you had no awareness of any illegal powder experiments on April 19? No. No, sir. No such awareness. Do you have regular conversations with Master Chief Skelley? As necessary, uh, like any other officer in my command. Captain, based on your familiarity with the ship and its crew, could you venture a theory of the explosion? Sir, 'm... I"m not, uh, alarge gun expert. - No. - Iunderstand. But what in your mind would be a fruitful path for us? The equipment? The propellants? The projectiles? The personnel? What? - Personnel, sir. - Why do you say that, sir? When I took over this ship, it had problems. Problems in the gunnery department, uh, problems in the Ward Room, problems in the engineering department. Officers who had mediocre evaluations on their last ship. Seamen who were kicked off shore patrol. Not exactly the cream of the crop, sir. I had asked for 130 gunner's mates. I got 88. So to tell the truth, I, uh, don't believe... the navy is supporting the battleships the way they should. The navy is supporting the battleships the way they should. I have to accept the fact that my brother is never coming home. But I won't accept the fact that my brother's $100,000 navy death benefit.. Should go to this man, Kendall Truitt, who didn't even know my brother two years. Captain Moosally, my parents are older and not in the best of health. They could really use that money. Any help you or the navy could provide in resolving this matter... would be greatly appreciated. Respectfully yours, Kathy Kubicina, formerly Kathy Hartwig. What should we do with this? If you want, Navy Investigative Services will look into this. Sir, it is a judgment call, and I have no doubt that Admiral Chapin trusts your judgment. I'll take your word for it, Commander. Excuse me. I have an appointment. You gentlemen get a chance to look at that stuff I sent you? Yeah. Uh, this is not in there. Hartwig and Truitt, off the ship, are inseparable. It's rumored that they're homosexual lovers. In 1987... and, uh, maybe you should make a note of this... They were busted for cavorting and wrestling... - on their midnight fore watch. - Cavorting? What the hell is that? Well, it's not entirely clear. [ Chuckles [. Charges were dropped, but the rumors do continue. And Hartwig does make Truitt his beneficiary to the tune of a hundred thousand dollars. That's worth exploring. Well, tread easy, guys. You don't want to disturb the admiral. Bingo. Naval Investigative Services, Mr. Hartwig. - Agents Flynn and Cobb. - 1 told Clay. I said to him, “Pick good friends, do your best... and your officers will stand behind you.” I'm glad to see you guys working on this insurance business. I was against it when Kathy wanted to write you. 1 didn't think anybody would care. No, no. We wanna find out exactly what happened, sir. Clay was so proud to be asailor, like his dad. He'd put on his uniform and walk down the street. He turned the girls” heads. Mrs. Hartwig. Did, uh... Did Clay go out on many dates? Clayton? Oh, my, yes. He was very popular. Clayton was 16 when that was taken. He was going to g costume party. Clayton always loved the navy, even as a little boy. He was so foolish that night. Kathy, can you think of any reason why your brother might have wanted to kill himself? What are you... Did you know that your pal had a book called /mprovised Munitions? Sure. We got it ata gun show. We wanted to check out sixties technigues. Do you own a copy of Revenge: The Art of Payback? Yeah. It tells how to use cat piss to ruin your neighbor's lawn. - Ken. - It also teaches you how to make a bomb. We hear Clay got upset when you two got married. Yeah. He got pretty upset. - Is that because you and he were lovers? - What? Maybe it was a three-way. Carole, did you ever make it with Clay and Ken? We're done. You wanna talk to us anymore, you bring a warrant. We're done. You wanna talk to us anymore, you bring a warrant. How long were Clayton Hartwig and Kendall Truitt lovers? - I don't know that they were lovers. - You ever catch'em at anything? - No, I did not. - Didn't Lieutenant Stewart charge them with indecent... Those charges were phony. George Stewart... Stewart caught them sucking face during an overnight watch. George Stewart brought those charges because Truitt was loan-sharking, and Stewart wanted him off the ship. Did you know that during liberty they slept in the same motel room? - Every enlisted man I know... - Do you split motel rooms with other guys? These are gunner's mates. Do you know what gunner's mates earn? Truitt was loan-sharking. Why did he need Hartwig to split the motel room? - I have no idea. Maybe Hartwig... - You ever seen them fight? No, I never saw them fight. Look, they were... They were close. Like husband-and-wife kind of close? - They were friends. - Who was the husband and who was the wife? - Who was pitching and who was catching? - They were friends. Don't you guys have friends? Oh, sorry. You're with the N.I.S. I forgot. When Truitt got married, did Hartwig act strange? Did he keep to himself? Did he commit any vandalism? - Did he act weird? - He acted the way he always acted. If1 told you we found tubes of K-Y Jelly in Hartwig's locker on the ship, what would you say? - What? - We'd say we got a fag. A fag wife. Who got dumped and killed 46 innocent men because he wanted to blow up his fag husband. Now, that's what we would say. What would you say, Lieutenant? I'd say what's relevant. Turret Two was filled with defective equipment. The gunpowder, which was made in 1940 by the way, was improperly stored in unventilated barges in the middle of the summer. And most important, Clayton Hartwig was nowhere near the gun. We found his body in the gun pit. He couldn't have done any damage if he tried. Informed sources confirm that the Naval Investigative Service beljeves... the explosion was the result of a murder/suicide committed by a distraught seaman. - According to these sources, the N.I.S. has eliminated... - Bastards. When did Hartwig tell you he was gonna blow up the turret? He never said he was going to blow up the turret. How many days in advance? He never said aword about it. Ten days? Five days? Three days? How many days in advance, Timmy? If you don't tell us how many days in advance, we gotta charge you with perjury, obstruction of justice, 47 counts of accessory to murder. Clay never said any days in... Did he tell you the day he showed you the timer, or was it before that? I don't know what you're talking about. Did he keep the timer in his locker? He showed you stuffin his locker, right, Timmy? He showed you his Bibles, his music, his krives. He showed you stuff, right? Yeah. But there's no timer. Did't he take the timer out of his locker and show you how it worked? Timmy! He showed you his private stuff, right? You guys were buddies. Were you and Clay more than buddies, Timmy? What are you talking about? Did he tell you he loved you? Hmm? Did you and him go to motel rooms? - You weren't cheating on Ken, were you? - Are you out of your mind? I"m not gay. No. Kenisn't gay. Clay isn't gay. It's too late for that now, Timmy. We know he came on to you. He liked you. - He came on to you every chance he got. - No. - Did you lead him on, Timmy? - No. - You fought him off, didn't you, Timmy? - No. Did you fight him off on the ship... or on the shore? I never said I fought him off. You led Aim on? You led Aim on. What do you think of Admiral Langlett? How do you mean? You think he's an honest man? Never heard otherwise. He's ignoring evidence. Lawrence Langlett is a navy admiral. He's assigned to investigate the deaths of 47 American seamen. Trust me. He's not ignoring evidence. Dan, your duty is to protect your men... by making sure the turret is safe. Langlett's duty is to determine the cause of the explosion. Now, don't confuse the two. To make my turret safe, I have to know what really happened. And what I'm finding out contradicts what Admiral Langlett's finding out. Doesn't mean you're right and he's wrong. I don't believe that Clay Hartwig... either could have or would have killed himself and 46 of his shipmates. I don't believe that. I believe the navy is scapegoating a dead man to protect itself. The navy wouldn't do that. Your navy wouldn't do that. So, Gunner's Mate Timothy Sykes, did Gunner's Mate Clayton Hartwig ever show you a timer or ignition device... he intended to use to blow up Turret Two? Yes. Investigators believe that Gunner's Mate Clayton Hartwig... planted a small detonator in the breech of the turret... in order to kill himself and another sailor in the turret. - Ken. - Hartwig is said to have had a special relationship... with Gunner's Mate Kendall Truitt. Sources at the N.I.S. said that Hartwig named Truitt as beneficiary... of his $100,000 navy life insurance policy. Although the navy officially denied... that it was limiting its investigation to the murder/suicide theory, You went to Cornell, right? Yes, sir. You, uh... You play any sports? Squash. Squash. Not much of a team sport, is it? You, uh, told the admiral and N.1.5... you found Hartwig's body one story down in the, uh, gun pit. L'saw him with my own eyes, sir. Yeah. I read your report. A tattoo of the Jowa, G.M.T. Hartwig. You and Petty Officer Mortenson put a question mark after it. You weren't even sure, and you were right there. It was Hartwig, sir. I remember that tattoo. I saw it when I was in the gym with him. It was the only one on the ship like it. He couldn't have made it down there before the powder detonated, sir. Well, he could have if he'd, uh, used a timer. There was no evidence of a timer, sir. See, we have men all over this ship... repeating your version of the story, and damn it, it could have been anybody. Anybody. Timmy. You talkin' tome? Sure, I'm talkin' to you, Ken. Hell, I don't owe you money. Where you transferring to? Mayport, by Jacksonville. How'd it go with the N.I.S.? - Well, you know. - Yeah. I know. They see fags everywhere. Don't let 'em get to you. They did, huh? It's not quite working out the way you thought it would. The bastard recanted. - We spent three days with that prick! - Gentlemen. I notice a lot of the information... from the investigation is getting into the media. - Now, do you need any help? - Wwe're all right, sir. Because it would be a terrible thing if the Sykes retraction was leaked. The public wouldn't know who to believe... The Sykes who blamed Hartwig last week, or the Sykes who withdrew his statement. It's a load of crap. Sir, Clay was in the pit. No way he puts anything in the chamber. So why doesn't somebody tell the N.I.S. that? Someone did tell the N.L.S. that. It made no difference. Couldn't the captain tell them? That would make a difference. Listen, the admiral's report is almost ready. Let's just give him a chance to do the right thing. He's navy... just like us. This book, which was found in Gunner's Mate Clayton Hartwig's locker, gives precise instructions on how to build a detonator. Our tests indicate... Clayton Hartwig was the most likely person to have put a detonator in the chamber. What kind of a detonator? Was it a timer or a pressure device? We haven't been able to determine what it was. Was anything else found in Hartwig's locker that showed that he built the detonator? We're talking about thousands of possibilities here. We... The answer to your question is no. Nothing was found. - Was Hartwig unstable? - No. If he had been unstable, he couldn't have performed as gun captain. - Was he gay? - We have no hard evidence of that. There's never been any evidence of that. I know there's been speculation amongst the press, but [... - Excuse me. Those leaks came from the navy. - We categorically deny that. You're concluding Hartwig s @ mass murderer. By what standard? Beyond a reasonable doubt? I'd say preponderance of proof. Now, believe me, we'd be much happier if we determined that the explosion came... from a technical malfunction, orasimple error. But that wasn't the case. Now, the inquiry demonstrates that the Iowa guns were shipshape... and its powder is safe. - Admiral Chapin... - Admiral Chapin... The United States Navy has determined... that it was an intentional act... caused by your son, Clayton Hartwig. Clayton Hartwig was despondent, emotionally unstable and predisposed to suicide. Acting alone, he planned his ultimate end.. In a place and manner intended to gain the recognition... he felt had been denied him in life. He is the only individual who had motive, knowledge and physical position... He is the only individual who had motive, knowledge and physical position... within the turret gun room... to place a device in the powder train. That summarizes Admiral Langlett's report. That is the navy's position. And therefore it is mine, and... it is yours. If you are asked about this tragedy... by your families, your friends, your drinking buddies... or the press, you'd be doing yourselves, your shipmates... and the navy adisservice... by deviating from the navy's position. Their theory is Hartwig did it. Our theory is it was an accident. But the only thing to support our theory is a list of possibilities... Maybe over-ramming, maybe defective gun powder, maybe friction. It's stupid. Hartwig couldn't have done it. We found his body in the pit. They've never accepted our position on that. They've always challenged it. It's crazy. I don't know what to do. This is the captain. We've been ordered to join the Sixth Fleet off the coast of Lebanon. As you may know, eight American fostages have been seized in Beirut.. And our embassy is surrounded by hostile demonstrators. Before we join the fleet, we are required to test fire our guns to recertify them. Therefore, at 0900 tomorrow, Turret Three will fire three shells... and Turret One will fire six shells. This is a recertification so that we can go to war. There's a Maronite general who's sworn to seize our embassy in Beirut, and we're gonna stop him from doing that. But we can't stop Aim unless we recertify our guns, and we can't recertify our guns unless we fire them. Now, can I promise you that nothing will go wrong? No. But we're the best. We know our guns. Turret One, left, right and center guns. One round, load. - You will fire at 10,000 yards. - Say again? No, it's clear. Well, get in there and fix it, boy. Sir, we got a slight oscillation in this left gun. Ten-hut! Carry on. I came down to see what everybody was worked up about. We got to, uh, look alive, boys. We're about to turn loose a little hell. The only fear... should be in the eyes of the people on the receiving end of these guns. Turret One, guns to bear. Turret One, guns to bear. Bearing: 0-7-5 degrees. Range: 12,000 yards. Make me proud. There's haze. I can't make out the target area. - Bridge. - Give me radar verification of the target area. - Sir, C..C. confirms we have radar contact. - Very well. Prepare to fire. Turret One, guns loaded, ready to fire. Closing to 10,000 yards. Bearing: 0-7-5 degrees. Range: 10,000 yards. On my mark. Three, two, one. Mark. Boom. Good job in there, Baker. The Senate and House Armed Services Committees told the Pentagon today... that both panels would hold hearings... on the navy's probe of the /owa explosion. In the words of one senator: “Rapists, drug kingpins and Arab terrorists get the presumption of innocence, “while Clayton Hartwig Is condemned on the basis... of a laughable F.B.I profile.” - Bitch. - The Navy Times reported that Captain Fred Moosally, in his testimony to Admiral Langlett, dismissed his crew, missing no opportunity to characterize them as being... ill-trained and lackluster in accomplishment. Senator, I emphatically refute the notion... that this investigation has been a cover-up. The navy does not countenance such funny business. Admiral, don't you think that some other independent, separate agency should be in charge of this investigation? Careful, Larry. Firm but not defensive. I don't know who could be more interested... in finding the actual cause of this accident than the navy itself. - It is our problem. - That's my boy. When is Moose supposed to testify? Day after tomorrow, right after they return to port. I think he could do with some reassurance. I wasn't in command of Turret Two, so why would the committee invite me to testify? Even if they did, what would I tell them? “Hey, this is all a fraud. The navy is smearing Hartwig to save its battleships.” They could read that in the papers. They could see it on television. - 1t's gonna mean nothing coming from a lieutenant j.g. - Yeah, look. - We found Hartwig's body and we .D.ed it. - Which I told them, and they think we are mistaken. Everyone who's testified has been a captain or higher. - Admiral Langlett, Admiral Chapin. - Sir. The captain would like to see you. - See you later. - Yeah. All right, Stan. Okay. Right. Thank you. You're getting a lot of phone calls, sir. I guess, uh, everyone just wants to make sure you toe the line tomorrow. - What's that? - No disrespect meant, sir. Uh, I was just tryin' to say that, well, you know, nobody wants to scrap the battleships. - Mean, uh... - I know what you mean. Knocking 7 - Come in. Sir. Lieutenant. Thank you, Mister Gil. Lieutenant, I"m, uh, testifying before the Senate Armed Services Committee tomorrow, and I want you to prepare a memo on some of the questions I might anticipate. Me, sir? Well, you know the case better than anybody. Well, sir, the committee will have read your testimony to Admiral Langlett... about... the quality of the crew. Yeah, well, I was misunderstood. I was describing conditions when I assumed command, not after I had taken over. Sir. Sir, what if you're asked if you knew the rammer system in the center gun... hadn't worked properly for more than a year? - It was never reported to me. - And that the rammerman the day of the explosion... - had never done a live shoot before? - Not uncommon. We don't do many live shoots, and, uh, I had a high turnover of gunner's mates. What if you're asked about unauthorized powder experiments? - Never mentioned to me. - Sir, what if you're asked if you agree with Admiral Langlett's findings? - Of course I do. - Even though no detonator was found? - Yes. - Even though the motive was questionable? Yeah. Even though certain witnesses dispute that Hartwig was in the gun room? No reliable witnesses, SO, yes. Even though there are alternative explanations for the explosion? I agree... with the admiral's findings. Sir... at the naval legal services office... are all the original documents and test data. May I suggest that you go over there now and review them. I agree with the admiral's findings. Sir, I strongly suggest that you read the raw material on which it's based. And I'll find what? Proof that it was an accident? I doubt that, Mister. What you'll find, sir, is testimony by your own men... Ordinary seamen who had no interests to protect and no axes to grind. Men who served with Clay Hartwig, who drank with him, who read the Bible with him; who found his body, who gathered up its pieces. You're the captain of the /owa, sir. What you say tomorrow will carry more weight than anything anyone else says. She's your ship, sir. Yes, she is. Captain, in your remarks about your crew to Admiral Langlett, you implied that they were, “incompetent and untrained.” Is that correct? I was describing the ship when I took over. Onice I was in command, the men were properly trained, That's not what you told Admiral Langlett, is it? My testimony was taken out of context, sir. Uh, let me set the record straight. My men had the skills, the training and the experience to perform their tasks. Our only deficiency was in maintaining formal records of those skills. The /owa I command is one of the best ships in the navy. The Iowa described in the press... never existed. Captain Moosally, do you agree with the navy's conclusion... that the explosion, which took the lives of 47 men, was a direct result... of a deliberate action? I agree with the navy's findings. Captain, I assume you've read the N.I.S. investigative report on the explosion. - Is that correct? - Yes, sir, several times. And do you agree with the navy's conclusions that Clayton Hartwig most probably blew up the gun? I, uh... I, uh... I would not come out and say that. No, sir. I cannot do that. - You yourself cannot do that? - No, sir. Do you believe Admiral Langlett was in a position to conclude... that Clayton Hartwig was guilty? I can't answer that question. I can't judge ifAdmiral Langlett could conclude that Clayton Hartwig was guilty. Would you yourself come to that conclusion, Captain? I haven't got the, uh, scientific or technical expertise to... Captain, you've spent 23 years on active duty. How is it you lack the expertise to agree or disagree... with the conclusion that Hartwig is guilty? Senator, uh, Mr. Chairman, I have not read in detail all the lab reports or the forensic report... Surely, as a professional navy officer, you have... No, sir, I am not amunitions expert. Well, neither is Admiral Langlett, but he reached a conclusion. That's his privilege, Senator. So, primarily, you have not had time to study the body of evidence. - No, sir, I have not had time. - And thus there is no other reason... you cannot come to a conclusion. Captain, if you took six months off to review all the evidence, would you then be in a position to conclude... that Clayton Hartwig committed this act? I can't answer that question. ! haven't had the time. Now, let me see if I understand this. You concur with the navy's findings that the explosion was the result of a deliberate act, but you disagree with the findings which specifically implicate... Clayton Hartwig. Are you satisfied, Captain, that the explosion... was an intentional act? I can and will talk... about what I directly know. I will speak to my own behavior, but 1 am not willing to speculate at the expense of the men under my command, Well, do you have any other plausible or reasonable explanation... for what happened in that gun turret? No, sir. In that case, Captain, have you formed your own conclusion... - about who might be the guilty party? - I have not. But you cannot conclude that Clayton Hartwig is guilty? No, sir, I cannot. Uh... I don"t know what happened inthat turret. I mean, nobody does who's aljve. I can say with certainty that a tragedy occurred in Turret Two. - What the cause of that tragedy was... - Captain, either it was a mechanical failure, possibly with human error of some kind, or it was a deliberate act. Now, the N.L.S. has spent some four and a half million dollars... and they have assured us that this was a deliberate act. Is that right, orisitnot? Captain? Captain, do I need to repeat the question for you? No, sir. You do not. The answer to your question... is that I cannot make an unqualified statement... that Gunner's Mate Hartwig or any one of my men... was responsible for any deliberate act. Those men gave their lives for their country, for each other, and I will not sit here today and point a finger at any one of them. I can't do that. What's more, sir, I won't. - I have nothing to say. - Captain Moosally? My son loved the navy and that ship as much as you. My son was a hero. My son gave his life for his country. Yes, ma'am. I believe that's true. You have to understand that Fred Moosally is the commanding officer of the /owa. Now, no C.O. wants to admit that one of his men went berserk and killed 46 of his comrades. So, of course Captain Moosally's gonna back up. Of course he's not gonna be sure. But as far as the chief of naval operations is concerned, the explosion on the Iowa was g deliberate act committed by Clayton Hartwig. It's okay. I mean, everybody knows. Sir, Gunner's Mate Kendall Truitt reporting as ordered, sir. Truitt. Truitt. Oh, you're that little faggot. So, you think that'll work for me. I piss off the captain, he'll transfer me off the ship? I guarantee it, though personally I recommend it only as a last resort. So what do you got? Another battleship? Another 16-inch turret? Communications on a command-and-control ship. The LaSalle. Not the same. Not the same. Hey, thirsty? - I don't drink with enlisted men. - I heard that about you. So what are you gonna do, huh? Gonna stay in the navy, be a lifer like your old man? That was plan “A.” I don't know. You done good, Mr. Meyer. Enter. - Lieutenant. - Reporting for departure for the LasSalle, sir. That was a hell of a ride. Well, sir, I just... thought what I thought. I just did what I did based on that. I believe you, Lieutenant. With respect, sir, why did you break ranks? Why did you put your career at risk for the reputation of a dead gunner's mate? - Good luck, Mr. Meyer. - Good luck, sir. Thank you, Lieutenant, sir. - Good luck, Lieutenant. - Godspeed, Lieutenant. - Way to go, Dan. - Way to go, Mr. Meyer. Thank you, Lieutenant. Good luck, sir. - Permission to leave the ship. - Aye, aye, sir. Two bells. Turret One departing. - Turret One departing. One year after the explosion, the Iowa was decommissioned. Captain Fred Moosally retired from the navy in 1990. Petty Officer Dale Mortenson also left.. And works in a factory in Michigan. Dan Meyer resigned from the navy ini1991.. And works as a lawyer in Washington, D.C. Although the entire ship's crew was awarded a Navy Unit Citation... for their heroic efforts to save the ship, the navy never delivered the medals to either the living or the dead. In 1991, the navy apologized to the family of Clayton Hartwig... for concluding that he had blown up the gun. However, the navy refused to exonerate Hartwig, saying that the exact cause of the explosion could not be determined. That is the navy's position to this day.
