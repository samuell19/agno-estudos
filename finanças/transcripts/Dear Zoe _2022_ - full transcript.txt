[♪] [female DJ] Currently it's 72 right now, with those winds on the calm side. It's just a glorious Tuesday morning here in Pittsburgh. We can see around us... [female narrator] Dear Zoe. [male DJ] Reports of a tie-up on I-79 north of the city... [narrator] I have memories of you from before you were even born. I just remember us sitting around the kitchen, arguing about what your name should be... [panting] ...and how that somehow made you a real person before I even saw you face. [tires screech] Mom told us Zoe means life, that this name would protect you... [woman] Zoe! but nothing could have protected you that day, except me, and I didn't. -I was just an ordinary girl with ordinary problems. -Mom! Divorced parents, annoying stepdad, lousy grades. Kind of lousy friends. But you, you were extraordinary, and I loved being your big sister. I'd get pissed if someone said you were only my half-sister, because you were never half of anything. [reporter 1] ...as the towers of the World Trade Center... [narrator] But then you left us on the worst day imaginable. [reporter 2] It's right on top of us right now. We gotta get out of the way! [narrator] On the news, they've been saying all year that history will forever be divided between what happened before 9/11 and after. But that erases your death, because you died on that day but not because of that day. You died because of me. [woman] Along the way, you might experience anxiety, depression, anger, even guilt. Whenever you feel the urge, write down in these notebooks anything you want to say or to remember. Why would we want to remember any of this? -[child] Tessie! -[man] Tess, get back here! Hey, sweetie, it's okay. Come here. -That was rude. -[car alarm beeps] I'm done talking, and I won't write in any stupid notebook. So, you guys, you can enjoy your trip down "recovery road," but I'm not going. You gonna tell her that? We need to do it to get better. Come on, sweetie. [scoffs] [Zoe laughing] [Tess] Guilt and grief are a powerful combination. They make you question things you used to do before. [man] Less time on makeup, more time on breakfast. Come on! Like, how I'd get into disturbingly in-depth discussions with Em about how you'd always stink up the bathroom. Ohhh! And how I'd pick my daily fight with David about wanting to go to art school instead of college. And my weekly fight with Mom about not wanting to spend time over at my dad's. Or how I used to gossip about boys with my friends on the bus and suffer through long, boring days at school... when I'd much rather have just stayed home and played with you all day. Oh, come here! Ohh! Mmm! Then we could have all gone to the market... Oh, you're gonna have a funnel cake. ...where I could have flirted with cute Justin. And you could have flirted with cute Justin. And now to bag this sack of potatoes! Motatoes! Maybe if I did something different, things would be different. Or maybe not. I honestly just don't know anymore. Because at the end of every goddamn day, reality set in... [kids laughing] ...and I was just left with before... and after. October. November. December. Words that meant the same thing-- after. [Em humming] Hey, Em. What are you doing in here? I like the wallpaper. Can I see? What is it? Santa lying face down, crying. Em needs Christmas. We don't have a tree or anything. Seriously? I'm trying, Tess. Try harder.

[sobbing] [door opens and closes] [David] What's that smell? [David climbing stairs] -[David] Goddamn it! -[crashes] [Tess] I basically had no life. I started thinking maybe if I made a little effort again, something good might happen. Hiya, Tess. How's your mother? She's good, I guess. [woman] So, uh, what can I get ya? We need a pound of turkey and some ham. Okay. Hey, Tess, wait up. Hi. How are you? I'm good. I'm great, actually. Would you give this to Elly? I-- I mean your mom. It's her monthly statement. Your boyfriend gave this to me. -Is that my dress? -No, take it. Really. It's beautiful. It's poetry, honestly. It's amazing. Poetry? What are you...? [sighs] -It's not what you think. -Or it's exactly what I think it is. No. You-- honey, you-- Don't touch me! Actually, I think it's great. Really. I hope you guys are just so happy together, because I didn't think you gave a shit about anyone, to be honest. Especially not your own family. -Let me see. -No. Oh! Okay, wait, no, I get it. This is, like, your thing, right? It's your thing because, yeah, well, we met David in a grocery store. And we met Justin in a grocery store. -So, what, is Justin gonna be my new dad? -Give me that!

Okay. Tessie! What do you think? [laughs] It's amazing. Ah, the ladies! Yeah, I found those in a box under the bed. You, uh... you still play with them? I just, you know, I've been keeping it nice for the day when you might finally come over. I just, uh... I didn't think you'd, uh... come over on your own free will or without calling, or in the middle of the night. [laughs] You hungry? I can order us pizza. I'm really glad you're here. -Yeah, me too. -Okay. [host] After the break, we'll be talking with Secretary of State Colin Powell. -[ringtone playing] -Our guest is truly an inspiration. Colin Powell is our country's first African-American National Security Advisor and the first African-American chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the first African-American Secretary of State. -Before all of that... -[landline ringing] ...he was a four-star general with a long and distinguished career. After retiring from the military, he built one of America's largest volunteer organizations that supports more than ten million children... [ringing continues] -Yeah? -[Elly] You are in such big trouble! -Mom, Mom, Mom! -You are so grounded! -Jeez, pull it together. -What? You run off in the middle of the night without telling me? You had me so worried. Tess, you are coming home right now. No, no, I'm not, because you'd have to get off the couch to make me, so... Nick, are you home? Nick? Open up the door! -[banging continues] -Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. -What are you doing? -Elly, What are you doing? Why is she here?! Why, why? -She just came here. -Why? 'Cause she came here. Calm down! -Hey, let her go! Go get her. -Listen! No, you listen! Elly's the custodial parent, not you. Huh? Not you! You are contractually obligated to send Tess home! Look, I know youse been through hell, and I have no idea how you're coping. -I really don't. -Mm-hmm. But I know that that kid in there is obviously hurting too. Come on. You're scaring her. Oh, honey, I'm sorry. We were just-- we were just talking. Give Tess some space. David, give yourself some space. For the weekend at least. I'm just letting everything fall apart, uh... Nah, man. The world just blew up. And nobody could stop it. [car door closes] [car engine starts] [car drives off] Thanks. Good night. [rap music playing] You need a name, huh? [puppy snarling] Something that's gonna help you grow big and strong, yeah? Oh! [rap music grows louder] Jesus Christ. Hey, turn that shit off! [rap music continues] [commentator] Pirates are wrapping up a good summer and first month. They had 13 wins against eight losses going into today's double header... -Dad, I did something wrong. -Already? You just got here. -Gave this little guy a name. -[puppy snarls] -Ow! Ugh! -Let me guess. -Chompers. -Colin Powell. You named that pup after the Secretary of State? [puppy yipping] I know who he is. -Can we keep him? -You may keep him. You gotta take care of him. That means you gotta spend a weekend here every now and again, all right? Deal. Man. Takes a puppy to get you to come here. -[laughs] -Look at that freakin' omelet. -Yeah, that's a freakin' omelet. -Yeah. Better than that damn nebnose I used to slave for. You used to? Here's the thing about working for the man, Tessie. They don't have a clue, but they're in charge. And you're stuck under them. Right? In this world, you've gotta be self-starting. You gotta take what you want, be a go-getter. [laughs] [indistinct chatter] -You workin' for Nick? -Yeah. Now and again. [Nick] Hey, hurry up! We ain't got all day! [man] Yo, Nick! [horn honks] Won't Tinnie miss her puppies? Nah, she'll be happy to have them out of the house. She's already starting to get annoyed. I thought they'd kill for them. Sure. Don't mean she want them hanging around forever. [engine revving] [rap music playing] [revving continues] [man] Hey-ey-ey! Huh? Let me take a look at you! You are finger-lickin' good! [laughing] All right, Trav. Pretty sure he's talking to you. Are you makin' fun of me? Well, if I were, I'd start with that God-awful shit you crank out at night. So, you don't even know me, and you're already trashing my music. All right. Cool, cool, cool. I'm Tess. I'm Jimmy. That little one friendly? [puppy whimpering] Hi. So, Tess, you run a construction firm? That's your shitty truck out there with your name on it? What are you driving, a Porsche? I'm not what you would call legal to drive. Well, how come? You're old enough. Let's just say, the last time I got pulled over, if I'd have had my license, they would have taken it from me, yet again. Well, see, if I ever get my license, I'm not gonna treat it like some lame-ass boyfriend I'm not really into. You got me there. Come on. So, how old are you, Tess? Seventeen. Well, 16, but, um, 17 soon. -August 26th. -Is that why you wear so much makeup? You're real smooth, you know that? I didn't mean it like that. I just meant you don't really need it, that's all. You want a beer? What? You heard me? -[ball game on TV] -[Nick griping] [Nick] Come on, ump, get a new pair of glasses. -Come on! -[puppy whimpering] Hey. [puppy whimpering] Giles, you overpriced, West Coast piece of-- Hit the goddamn ball! Put it back, and tell him to get the hell out of here. [scoffs] What? Dad, come on, he's harmless. -[in singsong] Put it back. -Dad! I don't want you hanging around with him. -Why not? -Because I said so. What am I supposed to do, hang out with you all the time? Finally! Finally he gets a hit! Yes! Uh, sure, yeah. You want to sit down? You can hang out with Tinnie and I and watch the Buccos? -No. -You can invite your friends over. They're from Murdoch Farms, Dad. They wouldn't be caught dead in Braddock. -[game commentary on TV] -Dad, what's the big deal? [Nick] 'Cause your mom would freak out. [Tess] I thought you were cool, but you're the worst! [Nick] Why are you yelling? [distant siren wailing] I heard all of that. I don't know what his problem is. Me?

[somber music over voices] [crying] [Tess] Dad's driving me to school in the morning. So, what, I mean, is he going to give you a ride home? No, I'm going to be hitchhiking back. Please don't talk about stuff like that. Mom, it's fine. [Elly] Well, you know that I worry. Em keeps asking me when you're coming home, so... when are you coming home? I need some time, okay? -I have to clear my head. -I mean, how much time? I mean, when are you gonna be home? I don't know, like a week? -A month? -A month! A month?

So I sell a little weed here and there to some friends for some personal use. Nothing hard. Soft, hard, call it what you want, Dad, it's still drugs and it's still illegal! In the war on drugs, your old man is far from the front lines. I am just a conscious objector doing my part. -Conscientious. -Exactly! And in my world, if a guy works hard all day and he wants to get baked before supper, so be it. Speaking of, burgers tonight. -What happened to the food truck idea? -It's still moving forward. Okay, I just got to get a little more money to fix the truck. Isn't that what the construction business was for? That whole thing's a racket, okay? Kickbacks, favors, no room for real growth. But you know what? It was a blessing, because in that madness, that's when it all came to me. I could be my own boss. Right? I could make my own hours driving around the neighborhood, spreading happiness to everyone, like an ice-cream man, but with weed. Ice-cream man? Dad, what are you talking about? Listen to me, it's amazing, right? You know how the ice-cream truck has, like... ding-di-di-ding-ding ding-ding, right, and everybody goes nuts? I play the Dead from my truck, and all these stoners come running out of their house, right? But, like, slow, when I say running, right? Like, slow, they're like, "Yo, dude, dude, slow down!" Like, "Slow down, dude! I broke my flip-flop!" And I'm telling you, it's working because by the end of the year, I'm gonna have that truck in tiptop shape. -Well, aren't you scared? -Of what? -Getting caught. -I'm more scared of being broke. Well, you know, there's this thing I heard about, it's called a job. It ain't that easy. Dad, it is that easy-- you work, they pay. Not what I'm worth. All right? Tess, I want to be able to give you things, to buy you stuff. You've got a DVD, a satellite, a big grill outside. How much is in my college account? News flash: I'm a shitty father. No. No, Dad, you're not. But in prison, yeah. In prison, you'd be a really shitty father. -[TV in background] -[distant train horn blows] -[rap music playing] -[Tess] Hey, ladder boy. Incoming!

No, no, no, it would be real nice, and then we'll invite your friends from school. -You haven't seen them in weeks. -They wouldn't come either. Look, you invite who you want to invite, okay? -How about we go celebrate? -Yeah. -Primanti's? -Like you even had to ask. Primanti's! [upbeat rock music playing] Thank you. -That's good? [laughs] -Yeah. Are you still in love with mom? [chuckles] I knew I should have put that photo away. Then why don't you? 'Cause it's the happiest I've ever been. King of the world. Prettiest girl in my arms. And you on the way. [rock music playing] So you seeing anybody? No, Ma, I'm taking a little breather with the ladies while Tess is here. Gotta get my act together, focus on being a parent. Yeah? How is that working out? [laughs] Oh, lordy, she looks just like her mother at that age. Oh, hi, how are you? Thanks for coming. Headstrong like her too. That Elly O'Connor was a real piece of work. She never appreciated where she came from. Couldn't get out of here fast enough. Hi, thanks for coming. Are those new clothes? This one seems headed the opposite direction. Keep your eye on things. [Jimmy and Tess chatting indistinctly] -Hi. -What's up, Nick? I don't remember inviting you. Oh, no, Dad. Dad, it's cool, I invited him. I told him to dress nice and bring something. It's apple. Looks delicious, thank you, Jimmy. Bro, chill out. She invited me, so... what am I gonna do? I couldn't say no. It would have been suspicious. Nah. You chill, Jimmy. In fact, get out. Whoa, Dad, be nice. Jimmy. Nice one, Dad. [Tess] Hey, Jimmy, stop! Please slow down! Oh, my-- Tess, this... this is not gonna work. Not as long as your father thinks that I'm not good enough for you. I-- I admit it, this afternoon didn't go according to plan, but we just have to keep trying. For what? You got to go back to the burbs, I gotta go back to my grandmama's crib, so maybe we should just call it right now. Is that what you want? I want you, Tess. [fireworks bursting] [Tess] I knew full well I didn't deserve to be so happy, but in the moment, it seemed convenient to just go with it. July melted into August. [rap music playing] Jimmy! Jim... -[cracks] -Shit. [laughing] I'm sorry. And for that, you come over here. Yeah, just take it step by step. There you go, you're almost there. -Take your time. -Yeah, but you have to help me. Hey, look, you're doing this crab walk. -I told you, face down, ass up. -What am I supposed to do? I don't want to look down! -Come on, just take my hands. -[distant train horn blowing] -[Tess] Hmm-mm. -[Jimmy] Oh, duck your head. [chuckles] See? Easy, huh? -I hate you. -Yeah, whatever. [rap music in distance] Dude, damn! You got sexy-ass pajamas on right now. -Thank you. -Yeah. Oh, my God, your room is crazy. -Thank you. -Shut up. Ehh, "You park like an asshole." Somebody left that on my dad's car like two years ago. Cracked me up when I saw it. Kind of like my window, Tess? -I keep telling you to get a phone. -Mm. All the good ones are over here, though. Hmm. "Think of me when you're visiting the big cat house. Mom." Oh. A field trip to the zoo? [Jimmy] Mm-hmm. That's really sweet. Yeah, it was. She, uh, died that day. The day she wrote that. I'm sorry. That's life, right? How did you-- how did you know to keep the note? She... she had to go to the hospital that morning. We didn't know what was wrong with her. Um... I was so... I was so worried that whole day, I couldn't eat the lunch that she had packed me. My stomach was turning knots. So, when I got home... oh, shit... I was hungry. I was so damn hungry. So I sat right here, I ate lunch. When I got to the bottom, I found that. But it's your turn, though. You gotta tell me some really sad shit now. Zoe! Tell me more about your mom. [sighs] She gave me this. [riders screaming] -[man] Come on, what you doing? -Excuse me, just hang on. Employee coming through. [riders screaming] Take me up. No. You can't cut the line. -Seriously? -Yeah. Besides, you're not even tall enough to ride. Dick. You really want to ride? Yes. -[Tess] No, no, no, no, no! -[Jimmy reassuring Tess] [Tess] Take me down, take me down! No, I can't do it. -[Jimmy] Baby, we're good. -No, I'm scared of heights, please. -Trust me, I got you. -No, I don't care. Just tell them to take me down! [Jimmy] Can't turn back now, we're already a hundred some odd feet up. [Tess] No, I don't care, please, just make them stop. -Please! -Stop like that? -[groans] -Open your eyes. -Tess, open your eyes. -No! Come on, open your eyes! Hmm-mm. [sighs] That's what you wanted. We here now. -Open your eyes. -No! Look, you gotta look at this. Open your eyes. I love you. Open your eyes. What did you say? What-- what did you say just now? -What did you say just now? -No, what did you just say? I said, "Open your eyes," you gotta see... -lemonade stand and... -No! ...there's Vicky right there. [laughing] No, look, I'm serious. I said-- I said I love you. I said I love you, Tess. Oh, my God, I love you! I love you too. Then let's fly. [screaming] -[laughing] Oh, my God! -[Jimmy] Wheeee! -[Tess] Whoo! -[Jimmy] Yeah! [Tess and Jimmy screaming and laughing] Hey, Tessie. Your mom's on the phone. [rap music playing] Tess DeNunzio! Outside now! You stay away from him, you hear me? But I'm almost 17. I'm not a little girl anymore. -Yeah, well, it's my house so it's my rules. -My body, my rules. What? Gee, your bod-- No! No, I'm putting my foot down. If I catch you two together again, I'm going to rip that stupid piercing out of his face and puncture his entire body with it. Oh, my God, I hate you! Yeah? Good. Good. [chuckles] Good. I hated my parents too. [dog whines] Oh, shit. Your mom's still on the phone. [Elly] Tess, do I not get to see you on your birthday? I'm not thinking that far ahead, Mom. Okay? No, it's not okay, because you're there... [sniffles] and I'm here, and we're supposed to be together. -Mom. -You're everything to me, the one thing I couldn't lose, and now I'm-- and now I'm losing you. I can't lose you both. I can't. But, Mom, Mom, you're not losing me. Things have been... okay. I got a summer job and... Dad's been great, actually. [scoffs] Your dad's been great? Okay, great, well, I always knew that you would run off to him one day, but I did not know that it would be for stability. So have fun. Oh. [distant train passing] [sighs] [knock on door] Hey, Tessie girl. Um... I never done this before. I don't know what I'm doing. I realized, uh... I ain't never asked you what's going on. I know you had to clear out of there for a while. You want to talk about it? 'Cause you can, you know. Anytime with me. Your mom and me... we, uh... we managed to do one thing right. [riders screaming] [upbeat music playing] Tess! Oh, my God! Where have you been? We haven't seen you in weeks. -Yeah, well, um... -Hey, a little help over here. Oh. Do you work here? -Yeah, I got a summer job. -Eww. Actually, it's really fun. Get to go on rides for free and eat cotton candy. Besides, my dad, he insisted that I get a job while I'm staying with him. You're living in Braddock? Hey, stop babbling and get your ass over here. Listen, guys, it was really nice to see you. Um, let's catch up soon. Sure. And we can gossip about what a bitch your coworker is. [Tess scoffs] Ashley, your family may have a lot of money, but it doesn't mean you have to be such a snob. Here. Thanks, princess. Thanks, Vicky, see you tomorrow. Dad. What-- what happened? Why aren't you at the restaurant? I couldn't do it. Tess, you wouldn't understand. Try me. I was going. I was, uh, all dressed and ready, and... I caught sight of myself in the mirror, I realized that... I'm not the guy. Not the guy? Dad, what guy? I was the guy a million years ago. But now I just don't know what to do anymore. I don't know how to keep a job. I don't know how to support my family. I don't know how to make something more of my life. My stupid friggin' life.

I don't know what I'm gonna do. -I can't believe you. -Listen to me, Tessie... [Jimmy] Hey, wish her a happy birthday. [Nick] Ah, shit. That's right, it's your birthday. Was that Jimmy? He was with you? Great. Surprise party, thank you. [sighs] [phone ringing] Tess? David. I need your help. What time is it? What's going on? You all right? No, no, I'm fine, this isn't about me. I just... I need you to promise not to tell Mom, okay? What's going on, Tess? It's about my dad. -[knock on door] -[Elly] Happy birthday. Mom? I shouldn't have-- I shouldn't have surprised you like this. I'm sorry, I was-- I was going to call, but then, um... I was afraid that you wouldn't want me to come, so... I would have wanted you to come. Where is your dad? Um... he-- he's at the gym. Tess, oh, my God. Tessie, these are beautiful. I'm so happy you're drawing again. Oh, uh, David told me to tell you that it's handled. Um, he said that you would know what that means. [sighs] Oh, um... Thanks. It's obviously not a car. [laughs] These are really cute. Thank you. I love that color on you. Your dad got me that. I thought that you might like it. It's great, thank you. -Can I ask you a question? -Yeah. Why did you marry Dad? You guys are-- you're so different. Well, I was pregnant with you, so that might have been part of it. I don't know, um... I think I was also trying to get away from my parents. You know, I remember the exact moment that I knew that I wanted to marry him. I was at a football game, and he had just scored the winning touchdown. And after the game, I saw him and two of his friends walking across the field, and so I started down the bleachers, and then all of a sudden, I saw all these guys, I don't know, like ten of them from the other school, heading towards Nick and his two buddies, and I thought, "Oh, God, something bad's gonna happen." I started calling out and Nick turns and one of the other guys called out to him and he said, "You ain't so tough now, Nicky DeNunzio." And your dad just turned and, without blinking an eye, he said, "You ain't got enough guys." [laughs] I fell in love on the spot. I know, that was kind of stupid. No, it's, um... it's kind of romantic. Well, um... thank you. I-- I love the presents. Yeah. I'm so happy. Okay. Tess, um, I know that this is not the sort of thing that people talk about, -but I need to explain to you what happened. -No, Mom. -You don't have to explain. That's fine. -Stop, listen to me. You need to know that I did not try to kill myself. After what happened, I felt like... the life got knocked out of me. And I couldn't sleep. And so, I, um, I started taking sleeping pills. You know, but no matter how many-- no matter how many I took, it just didn't work. -Mom, please, just stop, okay? -You have to believe me. You have to believe me because I would never, ever leave you. Never. [train passing] Thank you. [soft music playing] [engine grinding] [wheels squeaking] [dog whimpers] [door slams] [knock on door] Can I, uh, can I come in real quick? Look, I'm so sorry that I lied to you. I just didn't know when the right time or place was to tell you. But I brought you a birthday gift if you want it. Happy birthday, Tess. "This bag contains all the makeup Tess DeNunzio will ever need for the rest of her life." Yeah, very funny. That's not supposed to be a joke. [soft music playing] Hey, hey, hey. Tess, what's wrong? What's going on, Tess? Talk to me. Tess. Hey. [sobbing] [screams] I had a baby sister. Her name was Zoe. Wait! Hey, Wait up! [Tess] Mom and David both knew, but they wouldn't say. Even Em knew the truth. That I was supposed to be watching you. I'm going to go grab a couple things and then I'll drive you to school. Hey, Tess, tell your mom a plane just hit the Twin Towers. Zoe, come on, let's go inside. -Come find me. -Just stay there, okay? [newscaster] What we're seeing is a gaping hole in one of the towers at the World Trade Center... Where's your sister? -Um, she's outside. -Go get her. -[Zoe] My ball! -Zoe! [tires squeal] [gasps] No! Mom! Mom! [indistinct chatter] While we waited to hear if you were going to be okay, I kept playing it back over and over in my head. What if I hadn't taken so much time on my makeup? Then I wouldn't have missed the bus. And if the weather hadn't been so nice, I wouldn't have been out front playing with you. Or what if Mrs. Martin hadn't walked by at that exact moment? I couldn't stop thinking about it, because if someone, anyone had just done one thing differently that day, the whole world might be different! Like, what if I had just grabbed you and taken you inside? You would still be here. Mr. and Mrs. Gladstone. No! Why didn't I take you inside? I'm your big sister. I was supposed to protect you. -[sobbing] -It's not your fault, Tess. It's not your fault. It was a terrible, awful accident. But that's all it was, Tess. It was just an accident. Okay? You sure you don't want your pendant? Nah. You hang onto it. Plus, I'm coming home for Thanksgiving, so... Are you gonna be okay? Yeah. Bye. [truck engine puttering] [Tess] I made a deal with David that I'd come home if he got my dad and Jimmy out of jail. I didn't know exactly when, but surprisingly someone else did. You've got that same look of disappointment as your mom. And that's fair. You're gonna figure things out, okay? Tessie, I am so sorry. Worst day of my life was when your mom drove away. This is the second. Come on. [Tess] I don't want this to come out the wrong way, but... it was easier to forget about you at my dad's, especially once Jimmy and I started hanging out together. Just like Mom, I needed a little distance to feel something that wasn't sadness or anger. [soft music playing] [engine stops] [sobbing] At night, you slept with a TV remote instead of a teddy bear. You called potatoes "motatoes." And you wouldn't ever go anywhere without your bunny ears. Your were precocious and funny and loud and sweet, and I will never, ever forget you. Zoe, your name... it means life. -It's okay. -[Tess sobbing] I'll drop your stuff by tomorrow, all right? My, um... my yellow notebook, it's, um, it's on my nightstand. And... there's a-- there's a picture of Mom and Zoe and it's tucked under my pillow. Promise me you won't forget that, okay? I promise. What about Colin Powell? Do you mind if he stays at your place? At least for a little while. Seems like staying at my place for a little while is becoming a thing. [Tess laughs] -All right. All right, that's enough. -[Tess laughs] Tessie girl. Thank you. -[music continues] -[truck door shuts] [laughs] Tess! Hi! Come here! Baby, come here! I missed you! [Em laughs] Are you staying? Yeah. Yeah, I am. [Tess] I'm not saying everything is okay, 'cause it's not, but like the whole country, our story is far from over. A story about before and after. Before you were born and after. Before you left us far too soon -and after. -[Em giggles] [truck engine starts] Before I ran away to my dad's house... [Em giggling] ...and after. Before I was ready to get better and after.
