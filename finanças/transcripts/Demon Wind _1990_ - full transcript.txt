My spells can't keep them out now. Getting stronger. Did you bring the daggers and the diary? (dramatic music) George? (groaning) Stop it. Please, stop it, George. Oh!

Cory, would you talk to me? - About what? - About anything, about what you're thinking. - I'm just thinking about driving. - How much farther is your grandparents' farm? - I don't know. I think not far. - [Elaine] Cory, what was your dad like? (dramatic music) - Cory. - Dad. - [Elaine] Well, what was it like when you saw him? - He was just an old drunk. Stranger. - You know, it's funny. - [Cory] What is? - I really wanted you to find your dad. I thought it would help you (mumbling). Now I'm sorry I ever laid eyes on him. - What's that supposed to mean? - It means that in the past 48 hours you've not looked to me in the face once. In fact, since you found your father, you've completely and totally cut me out of your life and I'd just like to know why. - I brought you with me. - Yeah. But for what? You've not even spoken 10 words with me since we started up here this morning. (dramatic music) So? - It's just that since... It's since I saw my old man there's uh... It's been this voice inside my head like a loud speaker telling me to get to their farm. (dramatic music) I've been here before. - [Elaine] What? - In a dream. (dramatic music) - Welcome home, Cory. (laughing) (screaming) - Cory. Cory, are you all right? - Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay. - [Elaine] You just seemed to go somewhere else. - Well, I'm fine now, really. (dramatic music) - How are you, folks? What can I do for you? - How do we get to the Carter place from here? - The Cat? There's no such place. - This map says it's right near here. - That map is wrong. Now, unless you want some gas, why don't you just move on?! - Cory, maybe he's right. The map could be wrong. Let's just go home. - No. This is the place of the dream. The farm is near, I can feel it. (door creaking) Hello! (door creaking) Anybody here? Hello! - [Elaine] Hey, Harman! (chuckles) - A Moon for the Misbegotten. - Oh, please! Cory, I just want you to lighten up. - Bathrooms are back. (gasping) - Oh, no, I wasn't-- - Can we get something to drink? - We have beer, Coke, water and goat's milk. - Coke, please. - Same. Thank you. Has anyone else been in here today? - Old man Deavers a week ago. And Mrs. Wilson came by with the Little Linda last week. Are you Little Linda's friends? Did you meet her when she went away to school? I don't think Little Linda really went away to school. I think maybe Little Linda got into trouble and they sent her away. Did you meet Little Linda at school? - No, we don't know Little Linda. Uh, can you tell us how far the Carter farm is from here? (dramatic music) (door creaks) - I've never heard of it. (car engine buzzing) - That's got to be Dell's Jeep. - Good. I wanna get moving. - Elaine. - Hi, Dell. No! - Well, now, don't you look good enough to eat? Cory, my man! - Ow! Hi, Dell. How was the drive? - Sucked! But you know how women are: we passed that last mall, Terri panicked, and we had to stop. - I just got to get some outdoor clothes. - And you, you do look good enough to eat. That is why I keep her around. - Bonnie, babe! - Hi! - [Elaine] How are you? - I'm fine. - [Elaine] You look simply marvelous. - Oh, and you look absolutely divine. - Oh, thank you, thank you. (smacking) (laughing) - Bizarre greeting rituals of the subculture. Good afternoon, Mr. Harman. - Jack, man, I'm glad to see you. - Well, your message sounded urgent. So, here we are. - Thanks for coming. I mean it. - I know. - (mumbling) homos can keep your hands out of each other for a second, let's get something to drink. - Maybe Cory can tell us why we are here in the sticks. - Anybody want a beer? - No, thanks. - No, we're fine. - I'm fine. - What is it, just a no week? - Not for me. - That's why I keep her around. - This thing is about this big. - What's so funny? What is it?! - Nothing, Dell. - [Dell] No, what is it? - It's just a little thing, Dell, it's not worth mentioning. - You're right. - So, Cory, uh... Why did you bring us up here? - I found my father. - Is he okay? - No, uh... He slit his wrists the day after I saw him. - You didn't tell me that. - I know. I just couldn't. Four days after he was born, uh... His family disappeared from a farm near here. - Where was you dad when that happened? - He was in an incubator in a hospital and maybe he hadn't been there, they'd have got him too. - Did anyone ever find his family? - No, but after I was born, he came up here to find out what happened. And he never came home. I think something bizarre has been going on at that farm for a long time. I'm gonna find out what. I need your help. - I'm in. - Me too. (door creaking) - Let me give you some advice, son. Take your friends and go home now. - You've got business at that farm. Belongs to me now. - You do not own that property. - Oh, yeah? Then who's the owner of that land, old man? You, maybe? (dramatic music) - The dead. - You know, you're not only got (mumbling) problem, you're so out of your fucking mind! - You got to learn to respect the elders, boy, before one of them hurt you. - Oh, just hold on a minute here, Mr. We don't want any trouble. Do we, Dell? - No, no, no, no, no, no trouble. - Then all of you, get in them cars and go back where you came from. - What is it, Harcourt? What are you trying to hide? - I saw what happened to the Carter family. It was the drought of 29. A hot dry wind blew that summer. The cattle and the crops were burning to a crisp. The smell of death hung in the air. It happened on a Sunday. All the families were in church, except the Carters. And they never missed church, so that evening I went up to see if they were all right. God help me, I saw them... I saw-- - Saw what, what did you see? - Blood everywhere! Black blood on the walls! Figures in the dark, laughing, coming to me. And I screamed, then I ran. And I never told a soul. Til now. I let it not even loaded. Please, boy, don't go up there. - I have to. - I know. Well, you just follow that road to... Till it ends. - Thanks. It's all right. It's all right. (epic instrumental music) - Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the wonderful world of magic. Today we will take you to the land of illusion and fantasy, where the common place is fantastic and the fantastic is common place. - I didn't know your former boy was gonna be here. - Oh, neither did I. (epic instrumental music) - A princess should always have flowers. (clanging) (clanging) (clanging) (clanging) (clanging) (clanging) - Skinny little chicken, I'll shove that karate crap up your ass! - Be my guest. (bursting) - Come on, man, easy now. Easy now, don't hurt the rabbit. - Dell, Dell, Dell, Dell, cool out. I asked these guys to come and help me, okay? This I don't need. - I have to agree with him. We don't need the Feast and Fury demonstration, you know what I mean? Hi, Cory. - Hi, Stacy. I didn't think you guys were gonna make it. - What? And miss the chance to play (mumbling), to bring magic and wonder to the inner lands? The hangout with the beautiful people? My man, there just isn't any other place to be. Besides, you needed us to be here, so... Voilà. Here we are. - Glad to have you. - So, uh... What exactly is the nature of this little expedition, if I may ask? - Follow me up the road away and I'll show you. Dell, are you still coming? - Yeah, yeah, we're in. - What about you? - I don't know why or where, but I wouldn't miss it for anything. - All right, let's get going. - Next time, you little fag, I'll drop you like a bad habit. (car engine roaring) - Shazam! - Son of a bitch and idiots! - Still onboard? - All the way, Captain. - You're making a bad mistake, boy. - Maybe so, but it's mine to make. (car engines roaring) - Damned fools! (dramatic music) - What are you going to expect to find up here? - I need to have some answers about who I am. - Jesus! What do you think happened here? - I wonder who it is? - Stay away from it! Don't touch it! Please. (dramatic music) (screaming) - What is it, Bonnie? What's wrong? - That! (dramatic music) (buzzing) (wind howling) - It's my dad's older brother. - How do you know that? - I just know, that's all. - Here's the answer to the mystery right here. Somebody, somebody arranged one or two here, tortured whoever is in that cross and set fire the house. They must have died in the fire. - I don't know what happened here, but you can sure tell death walked through this place. (dramatic music) - Cory? Cory. Cory. - I'm going inside. - Cory, wait. There's something really wrong here. I think we should go. - Bonnie's right, Cory, I feel it too. Don't go in there. - I have to see what's through that door. You guys can wait out here. - Hey, catch. (dramatic music) (dramatic music) - "To Regina, with all my love." It's my grandmother. - "Nunc Protestas, Satane Vivet." (howling) (frantic music) (banging) (screaming) (banging) (screaming) (clattering) (banging) - Get out! Get out! (clattering) - Cory! (thudding) - What the hell is going on here, Harman?! - I don't know, I don't know! But what was that Bonnie read?! What did it say?! - It was Latin, it says, "Now Satan shall walk." - This baby will do the trick against whatever moves. - I don't care what it is, I say we get out of here now before the sun goes down. - Do what you want. Whatever is here killed my grandparents. I wanna find out why. (creaking) (wind howling) - Let's get the hell out of here, come on! (dramatic music) - My battery is dead. - So it's mine. - We have to get out of here now! - She's right. This place is possessed. - Be serious. I tell you, what we witnessed here is hallucination. - Come on, Jack, what happened in that house was real. Saw it with your own eyes. - Well, then I don't believe my own eyes. Things like this simply don't happen. - Jack, there is something here, something evil. - [Jack] Evil? Evil, where? - There. It's been waiting all this time. - [Jack] Waiting for what? - For us, for us to come here. Promise me something. - Anything. - If we die, don't bury me here. - [Jack] You're not going to die, Bonnie. - Promise me. - Okay, I promise, but nothing is going to happen. I won't let it. - Let's get her out of here. - Okay, let's grab what we can carry and walk back to the station. (dramatic music) - Now look how fast that fog roamed. - I think we're in trouble. - I think you're right. - I've never seen a fog like this. - It's not the same forest. - Of course it is. - Yeah, (mumbling). The same power that was in that house is doing this. - Look, it's coming back! (wind howling) Where the hell are we now?! - God, it's cold! - Oh, no, here it comes again! (wind howling) Oh, God! - Oh, no! - Son of a bitch! (dramatic music) (buzzing) - Dell, stop! - Hey, where do you come from, little girl? (rumbling) - Dell, are you all right? - You can't leave. - No! (screams) - You are mine. (screaming) (rumbling) (dramatic music) - You... Lied. (bursting) (dramatic music) - Now what do we do, Harman?! - Well, whatever is here isn't gonna let us go. - Then no shit, Sherlock! Do you have any other hot news for us?! - Yeah, the sun is gonna be down in a few minutes. We got two choices: the cars or the house for the night. I think we'll be safer in the house. - But something in there just tried to kill us! - I don't think so. I think whatever it is is only trying to warn us away. - [Dell] And how the hell do you know that?! - I don't! It's just a feeling I have. - Well, that's just crap, pal, because your feelings have got us in this shit hole in the first place! - I'm going back inside. (snorting) - Well, I'm not sleeping out here with you and (mumbling). - Lead on, McDuff. - You're crazy. Hold it, you're all crazy! - We have to talk. - Chuck, there's nothing left for us to talk about. - Come on, Terri, I can see it in your eyes back at the cafe. - Chuck, you're mistaken, I'm Dell's now. I'm gonna stay with him. - Terri, I love you. - Chuck, it's too late for that. Dell needs me. You don't. Life is just a game to you. It's not to me. I need somebody who's serious about me. Dell is. (chuckles) (thudding) - We could fight if you want to. But we don't have anything to fight about. - Well, let's go inside then. - Good idea. (dramatic music) - I think it's gonna be okay. Let's clean up. (fire crackling) - [Ghostly voice] Cory. (dramatic music) - Grandmother? (knocking) (thudding) (rattling) "Being the diary of Regina Carter, "born June 8th 1889. "I conjure thee, oh Delos, protect this my child "from the evil touch. "Rise now and approach me." (door creaking) (screaming) Christ! Are you trying to give me a heart attack?! - I could ask you the same thing. Oh, God! I made you some food. (laughing) - Some weekend, huh? - Yeah. Really know how to show a girl a good time. - I know it may not seem like it, but I'm glad you're here. - Oh, I'm glad to hear you say it. - I found my grandmother's diary. - Oh! (rustling) - "It is dusk. "I know tonight I will die. "Even the spells Grandmother taught me can't save us now." - Spells? - Yeah. "I know that someday you might come to face the evil "that comes for me. "In the bottom drawer of the vanity "you will find two daggers "which are part of the sacred set of seven. "The other five have been lost. "It is written that with all seven "you can kill the son of Satan. (dramatic music) "I pray these two might help you." (fire crackling) I found something. This farm was built by my great-grandfather. He and a group of settlers followed a preacher named Anders to this valley. But when they arrived, Anders began preaching about the false God of the Bible... And the true God he had found here. - He was a Satan worshiper? - Yeah. Trying to raise the Devil. Then three little girls disappeared. The searchers found them... What was left of them in an altar behind Anders' place. - He was a real sick pup. - There was a big fight. Anders and all of his followers were burned to death in his house. - That sounds fair. - I hope they cooked slow. - After that, everything was okay until the summer of 1929. That was the year my father was born. "June 8th. "Mrs. James just had triplets. "They were killed right after the birth. "None of the babies was even human." - All the children were the same. Except for Cory's dad. - What was so special about him? - I have no idea. But the last entry reads, "Everyone is dead except George and I. "It's all hopeless. "I can hear them rising out in the barn. "It's the..." And that's what happened to my family. - Now we're in the middle of all this. (dramatic music) (fire crackling) - Will the puppets from hell show tonight? - My son, if they do, we'll just have to go out and kick some supernatural ass. - Chuck, my man. I like your attitude. Very American, very... John Wayne. - Very what choice do we have? - It's a good point. - Man, I just wish we had some hand grenades or something. - I'd rather have a Tahitian vacation. - Not Tahiti. - [Chuck] Why not? - Voodoo, man, they do voodoo in Tahiti. - Let's say Chicago. - Vegas. We know there's no spiritualism in Vegas. - Good point. Vegas, it is. - Yoo-hoo! Chuck. Stacy. Come out! I'm here for you. Come out and play with me. Chuck! Stacy! Come out. - Demon. - Stacy! (wind howling) - Hey, Cory, guess what we just saw! Cory? Hey, Harman. Hey, Jack, wake up! - I guess he only wants us. - [Demonic girl] Here I am. - Let's go. - Why not? (demonic voices murmuring) They're playing our song. - All right. Let's dance. (demonic voices murmuring) - Over here. I have something for you. Surprise! - Eat this! (gun firing) Oh, man, I think we're in trouble. - I think you're right. (growling) (gun firing) (screaming) (gun firing) (screaming) (gun firing) (grunting) (gun firing) (laughing) (gun firing) (grunting) (gun firing) I think we've just to get out of this. - You doubt it? (gun firing) Hey, Chuck (groans). - What, maestro? - Presto. Eh. (gun firing) (grunting) (thudding) (repetitive thudding) (dead people murmuring) - I made it. I made it! Fuck you! - Surprise! (screaming) - What happened? What was that?! - It came from outside. - Where are Chuck and Stacy?! (dramatic music) - Stacy! Chuck! (dramatic music) Oh, no! - My God! Oh, no! No! No! - Terri, look, we got to keep it out together, we're gonna get out of this alive. - You didn't just see the blood? - Hey, trust me, I'll get us out of this, okay? - Okay. - Dell, we're gonna check the backroom. - Yeah. - Why didn't you tell the others about the daggers and the spells in the diary? - Tell them what? That my grandmother was a witch? She used spells to protect her son and this house? Dell's half crazy and Jack's a bastard case. One more thing and either are gonna lose it. - Maybe those spells could help us. - They didn't helped her much, did they? Keep this with you. May be some protection. - You don't think we can beat it, do you? - I'm sorry I got you into this. - Don't even think that, Cory, I got me into this. I'm here because I love you. - (mumbling) so lucky. - Magic. (wind howling) (creaking) (screaming) - Honey, you're all right, it was only a dream. You're all right now. - It's not big deal, Dell. - God, I wish I was home right now. - Quiet! (car engine humming) That's a car! - It's Willy and Reena! - Don't shut it off. Don't shut it off! Don't shut it off! Don't shut it off! Don't shut it off! Don't shut it off! Don't shut it off! - What did you say? - I said, "Don't shut it off." - Why not? (dramatic music) - But what we did wrong? We just got here. (barking) - Go back inside. - Hey, Cory. Look, pal, Terri and I aren't gonna spend another night in this damned house. Now we're going through that front door and we're going for help. - Dell, are you sure you wanna do that? - Yeah, I'm sure, sure as I'm about anything. (dramatic music) Hey, are you positive you wanna come with me? - Like I told you before, honey, wherever you go, I go. - That's why I keep her with me. (snorts) - You may need this. - Thanks, Cory. Let's get out of here. - I don't think they're gonna make it. - I don't think so, either. Better get back to work. Jack. - Yeah. - I'll be back in a minute. - All right. (creaking) (dramatic music) - Grandmother? Grandmother? Is it you in the house, isn't it? (fire crackling) Grandmother? What are the demons afraid of? Grandmother? Grandmother? - [Elaine] Cory. - This house is as secure as it can get. - So what do we do now? - I guess we wait. - [Jack] No. - What do you mean? - Well, I say we attack it. Now, Bonnie mentioned she felt something from the barn. - Jack's right. My grandmother mentioned the barn. Maybe there's a door with the leads into the barn. The same with the leads into this house. - And if that's the center of this force, we got to find some way to destroy it. - Now you're talking. How about you, guys? - Sure that beats waiting. - I don't wanna go, but if we have to, let's get it over with. - I'll get the flashlights. - I'll get the shotgun. (dramatic music) - Oh, no! - Shit! (wind howling) Terri? Terri! Terri, where the hell are you?! - [Terri] Can't you hear it? - Hear what? - Death! (thudding) (groaning) - But I loved you. - I loved you too. (laughing) (wind howling) (howling) - What was that? - It wasn't human, that's for sure. - Look. (dramatic music) - Come on. (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) - What is that? - It's an altar to the Devil. - God, it's horrible. - But there's something kind of beautiful about it. No, it really is beautiful. (growling) (whooshing) (screaming) Come on, help me! (screaming) Help me! Help me! (screaming) - Run, Willy! - It's just us. (mumbling) - Dell was good enough to eat. - But you're dead. - You can't kill what's already dead. (thudding) - Stay right there or I'll have to blow you in two. - That thing won't work in here. This is the house of the damned. (laughing) (thudding) (grunting) - Cory! Help me! (grunting) (groaning) - Leave! Oh, you don't like this, uh? (grunting) - Cory, where's Willy? - He must still be in the barn! - [Elaine] Shit! (screaming) - Forgot something? - Ah! (laughing) - Isn't he cute? - Cory, use the dagger! (screaming) - You killed me. (buzzing) (dramatic music) (creaking) - You all will scream in the hell tonight! - All of you, ha! (dead people murmuring) - Get ready! (dead people murmuring) (rumbling) Now what's happening, Harman? - Don't you see?! Ha! Grandmother's old spell still works! They can't reach us! - Are you sure? - Yeah! (laughing) Eat it, scumbags! - Come and get us! (rumbling) (buzzing) (banging) - Cory, now what happened? - Shit! The demons must have broken the spell! (dead people murmuring) - Here, take this. I'm gonna check the backrooms. - Jack. - Yeah? - Watch yourself. - Good luck to you too. (dead people murmuring) (dramatic music) (dead people murmuring) - So friend, we meet again. (gun firing) (grunting) (gun firing) (knocking) (gun firing) - Where did they go? - I don't know. Maybe they're still afraid of the house. (dramatic music) (grunting) - Jack! Jack, I'm coming for you! (thudding) (screaming) (dramatic music) (grunting) (thudding) (grunting) (thudding) (grunting) (screaming) - Get back! - No! No! Let me out! (grunting) (gun firing) (grunting) (knocking) (grunting) (crunching) (grunting) - Jack. Jack! Jack, it's Bonnie. Please, help me. - Bonnie? Bonnie! - Help me! - Bonnie? - Please, help me, Jack! Jack! Please, Jack! - Bonnie! - Help me! Jack! Jack! (groans) - God! (groans) This can't be happening. (dramatic music) (banging) (grunting) (gun firing) - Check Stacy's bag for more ammo. (grunting) (gun firing) (grunting) (gun firing) Hurry! (gun firing) (grunting) (gun firing) - There's no way we can keep them back! - Take the diary and tell Jack to get in here. (grunting) (dramatic music) (gun firing) - Jack? (dramatic music) - Elaine. It's Jackie. - Oh, no, Jack! Not you. - It doesn't hurt. - Jack, we can fight this. - Don't fight. I'll make it so sweet. (sobbing) You'll give the Father much pleasure. - Goodbye, Jack. (screaming) (rumbling) (rumbling) (rumbling) (rumbling) (sobbing) (dead people murmuring) - You all right? - Look, it's Jack. He turned into one of those things, I used the last dagger. I saw his soul. - It's okay. You did him a favor. You saved him. (banging) (banging) (screaming) (groaning) - Ah! (dead people murmuring) - [Dead man] Kill them. (whining) - I'm sorry. - I'm not. (dead people murmuring) - I have arrived, my children. Gather now. Come, my sheep. I am come to take you. Yes, you, the faithful. Tonight reap your reward. Wait is finally over. Come now. Now shall your suffering end. Our time is at hand. (dead people murmuring) Gather now for the time has come. I bring you greetings from the (mumbling) father. (dead people murmuring) Yes, my children, come unto me. So, my children, at last have we gathered. And after all these years shall we complete the cycle. - Father, take us. - I have fought for him. I love him. - Tonight shall we open the door for our beloved father. Yeah, my flock. Come. Come unto me. (dramatic music) (wind howling) - No! No! No, please, help me! - Bonnie! - Oh, God, help me. No! (screaming) - No! Stop! Bonnie! (screaming) (grunting) (screaming) - [Bonnie] No! (grunting) - Cory, help her! (screaming) (grunting) - There's nothing we can do for her. - No! (sobbing) (dramatic music) - Now (mumbling), I've come for thee! - The book! The book! We've got to try it! (mumbling), go! - [Demon] Father of Darkness, I'm, your son, have arrived. I have waited long for this might Cory Harman. (laughing) After all these centuries, now this world will be mine. (laughing) (mumbling) - I love you. - I love you too. - [Both of them] Oh, white light, oh, spirits of goodness and peace, oh, earth mother who watches over us... (rumbling) (mumbling) We who breathe that breath. (banging) - If you find us worthy, we beg of you, join us now to thee. (dramatic music) - Am I not beautiful? - I will be done. (bursting) (rumbling) - So, the old witch, she possessed the great secrets. - Yes. - They did her no good. I took her also them to grave. - And now you're gonna pay for that. (thudding) (groaning) (grunting) (dramatic music) - I will teach you how to read before you die. (rumbling) (dramatic music) You were always so weak. (rumbling) - Please, God! - The power of your God is nothing, little man. I am come to rule this world. You're the last of your lineage. The death of yours will ensure mine. (sizzling) Die, child little man. (sizzling) (rumbling) - [Elaine] Oh, he's coming around. Thank God, Cory. I can't find your pulse. I thought you're... - Man, you gave us quite a scare there for a while. You looked somewhere else. Cory, are you all right? - Yeah. Just a little woozy. Where am I? - We're at your grandparents' farm, remember? We drove up here. - What happened to me? - We walked in the front door, looked around and you just went out like a light. - Man, you hit the floor so hard, it was like you had belted by Mike Tyson. - Jack! Jack, you're all right! You're all alive! - Of course we're all alive. - Just like real life. - You were just dreaming. - Oops! (dramatic music) - Surprise! (laughing) - Cory! Cory! Help me! (rumbling) - Now you're my pig. It's the flesh you loved so well. - Cory, I'm sorry. I love you. - I love you too. (rumbling) (laughing) If she's dead... (rumbling) Dad?! - I always loved you, Cory. - No, dad. Don't! (dramatic music) Stop it! Stop it! (thudding) It won't work. I'm not afraid of you. You're the one who's terrified. (rumbling) - I fear nothing from you. - Another lie. You're terrified of us because we're alive. We can feel. You're only a shadow. You hide behind your cheap magic tricks because you're dead. God changed you into a snake and a chicken shit at the same time. - I don't need magic to take your soul. (grunting) (thudding) (dramatic music) And when you die, I will have your woman. Sure it will be fun (mumbling) how she will beg for death. (sizzling) (groaning) - Cory. Cory. (grunting) (whooshing) (thudding) - Get the diary. Read the last spell. Do it now! (thudding) - We call upon the power of Light. Drive this evil (mumbling). Set it back into the darkness from where it came. We call on the God of Light. Bring this abomination (mumbling). - No! - They will be done. - No! (bursting) (groaning) (house exploding) (dramatic music) - Cory, you're human again. Is it over? Is it really over? (birds chirping) (knocking on door) Hello? Hello! Harriet? - [Harriet] Elaine, is that you? Oh, I'm so glad you came. My uncle, he was-- - I know. - Elaine, come here. I have a surprise for you. - That's okay. We have a surprise for you too. (screaming) (rumbling) (car engine roaring) (growling) (dramatic music)
