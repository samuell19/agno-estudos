A FILM ABOUT FIVE EASTER DAYS AND TUESDAY'S SOBERING UP MAUNDY THURSDAY FIREFIGHTERS Bronya? Here, Standa. What the fuck are you doing with that rope? Jesus, man! It was Maruna's birthday yesterday. I know how you feel. You just need time. You saved me. Your parents would be proud of you. Especially your father. That you've become a fireman. Fuck off... News, news, go now, to every nook and cranny of the town... -Mom says he drinks like a fish. -That's the man! SOMEWHERE OVER THE CHEMTRAILS Fellow citizens, the municipality and the Volunteer Fire Department, organize the annual fair from 1 pm at the village square. -There'll be a party tomorrow? -Yeah! I'll come! There will be beer, lemonade, grilled sausages, and sweets for kids. The brass band The Dandies will play for dancing. You can look forward to an evening surprise. Thank you for your attention. The green beer is not bad. It just pisses me off that I have to go outside to smoke. I can't enjoy the drinking that way. That won't get better. At least it's a reason to get some fresh air. Isn't it beautiful here? Except for the fucking chemtrails. What? They throw all this chemical shit and viruses on us… We can't do shit about it, but vinegar helps. The government is behind it. Different corporations. If you get sick for no reason then don't be surprised. I am telling you, try vinegar. A METEOROLOGIST ON THE EFFECTS OF VINEGAR The old Hlaváček asked about the cherry tree again. So I promised him you'd really chop it down tomorrow. GOOD FRIDAY You can wait for Bronya. Come on... I can cut it down myself. Poor thing. When the baby is born, I'll plant a new one. Be careful, daddy, I'll rather keep my distance. Yes, do that. Bronya! -Hi there! -Hello! Standa! We have to go! We will do it tomorrow! How could it break, Mr. Firefighter? -Hello! -Hi, what can I get you? -A beer, please. -A beer? Okay. And a rum. -Here you go! -Thank you. Forty. Thanks. I've decided, at the urging of my wife, that we are going to build a new road next year. You can't drive in there. Go around. -Was it someone from us? -Some black stinker. A migrant! Mayor, go! Mayor, go! HAPPY EASTER 2 meters 80. Bronya is still the best one! Anyone else or has everyone thrown already? Standa hasn't yet! I don't want to. Come on! Every fireman has done it! Standa! Standa! Standa, go! Standa, go! You racist asshole, you want to kill my kids? Welcome! Hi kids! Hello! -Guys, can I throw as well? -Sure! Go ahead. Okay. Now you'll see! Gejza! That was by far the longest! -Great job, Gejza! -Well done! He outthrew you! No wonder you're bald. Look who's talking! I am pissed off because you're friends with him. You know better than that. I'm not prejudiced like you, dude. It's not prejudice, it's experience. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen! Good evening. It's getting dark, so the moment is coming. I'm sure you've all been impatiently awaiting. Our festive and very costly fireworks display that our municipality decided to get for this annual Easter Fair! Fireworks! That's cool! But not on the day Jesus was crucified. Happy Easter to everyone! Long live the mayor! Long live the mayor! I have to say I'm pretty drunk. I wouldn't want to put out a fire now. I'd like that. The last real fire was the old Vácha's barn. It's been two years already. And it'll be three. I'm so happy! The people deserve it! They are here, motherfuckers! This is an attack! Everybody take cover! The van is empty, one man injured! Fuck! Gejza! Stay in hiding! Jesus Christ! Eržika, get the fuck out! Where are the kids? This is a racial attack! I always said it would happen even in Czechia. Those Arab fuckers! Don't worry, boys, it'll be okay. HOLY SATURDAY Fellow citizens, pay close attention to the following announcement. Due to yesterday's unfortunate event, the mayor will hold an emergency meeting. It will take place today from 10 am at the community centre. The meeting will be held in the presence of the police who started to investigate yesterday's accident. Please have no fear and attend it in great numbers. I repeat the announcement. Due to yesterday's unfortunate event... Jana? Jana! What's wrong? Running around outside like that! What are you doing, Standa? And the eggs are fucked... Standa? I'm sure it wasn't a terrorist. And they'll find the driver soon. Those theories of yours! Did you hear me? What do we do? We must stop being afraid, that's what they want. The police will sort it out. Can you smell that? What? I feel like having a brawn with vinegar. Welcome and thank you all who were not afraid to come to this meeting. The police found out that the van was stolen last night in Bolehošť. Its owner was in the pub at the time. -Mr. Policeman. -Thank you. As Mr. Mayor said, the perpetrator is unknown at this time. However, there is no indication that it was a terrorist attack. -See, it could have happened differently. -Are you fucking kidding me? What do you mean, "there is no indication"? Every idiot can see that it wasn't an accident. What "no indication"? Exactly! He's right! He must know that! He was the first responder! He's a hero! You are the Czech Police, you should take care of the Czech people! And not defend the terrorists! -Please calm down. -I'm calm, dude! So don't yell at me! We're not defending anyone. We can't rule out the possibility of an intentional bodily harm. And we'll be looking for the perpetrator. Because we acknowledge that he may still be dangerous. I would urge citizens to restrict movement and avoid public spaces with high concentration of people. Which is why it would be a good idea to cancel Monday's traditional caroling. -Is he crazy? -He can't be serious. To cancel the caroling? That's an attack on our traditions! I know. I know. I didn't like the idea either. And what about the Easter Vigil? The night of the Resurrection of Jesus? I was strongly advised to cancel that as well. Bronya? Do you have a minute? Come inside. There's a lot more of them flying today. People tend to overlook it, because it doesn't manifest itself as quickly and visibly as when someone crashes a car into people… I found this in front of my greenhouse. -Is it the thing? -Yeah. -Fuck! Guys, we'll meet at the church tomorrow morning. We're going to help with the Holy Mass. Jarin, ask around if anybody wants to help out. Reinforcements will come in handy. I wish there was a fire instead. Everything will be alright again, I'll take care of it. Look, the Vietnamese shop is open. Can you pull over? I need to buy eggs. Chickens don't lay enough? You wouldn't expect a big tragedy to happen on this little village square. But it happened during the Easter… Once more. Go ahead, pussycat. You wouldn't expect a big drama on this little village square. But during the Big Friday Fair, this van crashed into people... Don't be afraid, honey, it's me. -Hi! -Come in. Did you help her with all this? No. Unbelievable what she can do just before giving birth. She's great. -Hello. -Hi. -Hello Jana. -Hi, Bronya. Thank you so much! You saved my husband's life. We'll be forever grateful. How is he doing? He's pissed off and broken. Don't worry, he'll make it. -Gejza is a tough guy. -I know. I'll wait outside! -We're going to cut down that tree. -Finally! Here are the eggs. Thank you. -Shall I make coffee? -Yes, thank you. But leave it on the shoe rack, don't go outside, it's dangerous. Then make it yourself, you hero! He's worried about you, that's so nice. She just doesn't understand that my concern is legitimate. It's like there wasn't any danger at all. You know women, they can be hard to please. To women! We have to protect them. I remember until today how wasted we got with your dad when he told me that your mom was pregnant. And I couldn't get over it because we couldn't have kids of our own. And here I'm now with you, and Standa the Third is on his way. Fuck, he would be so happy! And your mom as well. Well, he wouldn't be very happy about me. I didn't get to learn anything from him. I don't know shit. I can't do anything. Whenever I need something, I call you. Do you know how much it pisses me off? I can't even cut down that fucking tree by myself! I'll teach you. Don't cut it at a right angle, or the chainsaw will get stuck. You need to cut out a wedge, so that it falls wherever you want it to. What wedge? A wedge. Have you ever cleaned it? You should. Why so much vinegar? It's on sale now. I also bought one on Wednesday. I haven't been smelling anything but vinegar lately. I see, Standa is going through a vinegar period right now. -Gejza had one as well. -Look, that's from our village! Miraculously, nobody was killed. Only one middle-aged man suffered serious injuries. Dad is famous! The perpetrator managed to escape the crime scene undetected. The police are still investigating the accident. Can you please introduce yourself? I am Bronya. The chief of the Volunteer Fire Department in our village. It was me who put out the fire in the van. So you are the hero! Could you describe the perpetrator? The van went by very fast. But he was definitely dark-skinned. An Arab probably. That is a very daring statement. So you don't think it was an accident? I think... We should all take it very seriously. Jana! What are you doing outside? You know what I told you… Bronya? Did you actually see the driver? Why did you say on TV he was dark-skinned? You were on TV? Well… It's obvious he was dark! Arabs aren't white. You didn't see shit and you are lying! You are inciting hatred! And you? Did you see him? So why are you saying it's not true? No, I didn't but... Why would anyone do it here in the village? It doesn't make any sense! They don't care if they kill some village gypsy or someone fancy from Prague. For them, the dying is important. I don't want that here, and I'll do anything to prevent it. No one wants that, Bronya! I'm saying you shouldn't scare people until we find out what really happened. The van could have hit you! And Standa would be a widower now. You have no idea what it's like to lose somebody. I understand it's hard for you, Bronya. Your wife passed away, but... Do you think Maruna would like what you've been doing here? Leave Maruna out of this shit. You won't say anything, Standa? You should stop ignoring it. Look what happened to us. Why didn't you say anything? Because I agree with Bronya. Well, that's great! Finally! Climate terrorism… Fuck! Does vinegar turn you on? What? No. You don't have to keep secrets from me. I'm your wife! No, you don't have to… Happy Easter! Your mayor, Milan Růžička! RESURRECTION SUNDAY Dear fellow citizens! I have great news for you! Today's Holy Mass will take place! Don't worry, we will protect your safety! You will be picked up by an armored security bus and escorted to the church by our fire brigade. I am happy I was able to arrange it for you! Happy Easter! Your mayor, Milan Růžička! Darling, I must go… Jana? Jana? Can you tell me what this is? A computer... You don't get turned on by vinegar, you've just gone insane! I told you I don't get turned on by vinegar. So why did you cum yesterday? Because I'm a man. Clearly a totally stupid one! Don't tell me you believe all this bullshit? Tell me you don't believe it. Jana? Jana! Is it time? I don't know… What should I do? I don't know. I'll call Bronya. It's going to be fine. Hey! I'm okay. On behalf of our village, I wish you all the best. We are looking forward to the newborn Standa! Thanks, Bronya! Thanks. Hold on, Jana! Drive carefully! You are the reinforcements? Hatred is not the way, Milan. It's all about safety. Hello. Hey. Hello. May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the Resurrected, be with you all... And also with you. Dear brothers and sisters, welcome to today's service. In this exceptionally cruel Easter time… we should be thinking of handicapped people. There are visible handicaps, when, for example, a man loses his leg or hand. And there are invisible handicaps. And these are much worse. When a man loses the feeling of love in his heart. When a man loses his mind. His hope. The faith in his soul. And the Easter time is an opportunity to resurrect in us what might have died deep inside. All that which is beautiful. Love, hope, faith… Let all that resurrect in us! And therefore I beg you, let us try to understand the one, who did it on Friday. He lacked all these attributes. He was struck with hatred. What is this bullshit? It is therefore crucial to pray for this person. And help him overcome his sins. You can't be serious, Father! Let's go. Let us also pray for Gejza Bendig who became the victim and suffered so much torment and sorrow on Good Friday. Let us pray for his recovery. You talk about that gypsy as if he was Jesus! This is the last time I came here. Men, we are leaving, too! Young lady, you just had false labour pains, the labour hasn't started yet, the child is completely fine, but we'll keep you here, just to be sure. Thank you. Standa, go home. I want to be alone now. It's nice of you that you came such a long way because of me. Has Bronya come with you? No, I came alone. That's a pity. I wanted to thank him. How are you doing? Well, you know, I am pissed off. Did they catch him yet? Not yet. Fucking wogs. Did you see him, too? I didn't, but… Who else could have done it? Dirty Arabs! No one wants them here. Hey... Would you peel a tangerine for me? Last but not least, let us pray for ourselves. Let love, hope and faith take place in our hearts as well, and not hatred and fear that deprive us of our freedom. Let us not be afraid! I wish you all, within the bounds of possibility, a blessed Easter! The Lord be with you. Blessed be God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Amen. Go in peace, glorifying the Lord. Hallelujah, hallelujah. Beautiful. They think they can come here whenever they want... and more of them will be coming! I hope I'm not the only one who cares about it! Don't you care? -We do! -Me too! Of course I care! Are we a village that holds together or not? They could have easily killed 20 people! It could have been anyone of us! And he wants to justify them? He wants to justify them?! Those hyenas without any emotion! And in the meantime, more and more are coming. -Do we want this? -No! -Do we want this or not? -We don't! Not me! I don't! Away with them! Away with them! It was a false alarm, but they kept her there. Standa here… will be a father soon. Standa, do you want your child to live in fear? No, I don't. Joska, I'm sorry, I cannot give you absolution. All your drinking will be forgiven. But you have to tell this to someone. You need to rectify what you've done. I will not tell anyone, because I can't. The seal of confession is sacred. But you can. You have to tell the people! Please keep coming here, it is important! -Today sucked. -Don't talk about it anymore. Happy Easter! -Hey, Bronya. -Hey. Do you have a smoke? A fire? I have to tell you something, Bronya. Do you want to join the fire brigade? I don't think so. But you know how everyone is saying that it was a terrorist, it's not true. Sure it was a terrorist. I saw him. It was me, Bronya. But I'm no terrorist. Sure, but you are drunk, aren't you? I am. But I am not kidding. It was an accident, Bronya. I was a bit drunk. I forgot the road was closed because of the fair. Otherwise I would have been there too. You know how I was looking forward to the fireworks… Holy shit, why didn't you tell anyone? I was afraid to. I stole that van from one bastard who fucked my sister. You were right to keep your mouth shut. It's much better for the people this way. You woke them up! Make sure you don't tell anyone! Otherwise we are all fucked up. Including you, dude. Thanks, Bronya. Bronya? I have an idea. What if you scoured the area a bit with your men? In the streets and in people's homes. I think the caroling could turn out well tomorrow… People will be calmer if you check everything out. What do you think? Man, that's a bit dangerous! Go home if you're scared! We solemnly swear... we will serve our country, Czechia. We won't hesitate to give our life for its protection and freedom. We swear we will love one another. Support one another with brotherly love. And never abandon one another in danger. And defend one another until the end, as our manly honor dictates, as well as the knowledge of our civic and firefighters' duties. This we promise. I'm sorry, Rosťa. But we need men who have no doubts. The Interim Deputy of the Commander of the Unit will be... Standa. Give me strength, please! Show me the way! I cannot let this be. Something has to be done! We'll need to open this woodshed. There's nothing in there. I believe you, but we really have to look everywhere. Please. No. -He doesn't want to open the woodshed. -Come on, grandpa, open it! No. Open it! There's nothing. Why didn't you open it? Because you have no right to do this. You did great. I have always believed in you. Thanks, Bronya. It has never been so safe here like today. But I'm still not calm. I'm afraid. What if more of them return? I'll tell you something. You'll shit your pants. It wasn't a terrorist, it was Joska, completely wasted, who hit the fountain. -What? -Yes. He told me himself. He was driving drunk, forgot the village square was closed, and didn't manage to brake… What an idiot! Jesus… Thank God, man! He told me himself today in the morning. You mean before all the inspections? You'd better not tell anybody. I only told you, because I know I can trust you. Have you put vinegar around your house? I always take old towels, soak them in vinegar, and lay them out in the garden, because vinegar is sensitive to air humidity, so it produces negative ions… The electric charge quickly spreads upwards and makes the dust from the chemtrails more dense, so the clouds disperse! Today the booze is on me! You're all heroes to me, every single one of you. Hats off! And you can also smoke inside today. Until they catch that bastard, fuck the law! Very nice! Guys… Tomorrow we're in the streets from early morning, so don't get wasted. I know it's very tempting… when the beer is free. Don't worry! Right, Lojza? Guys, come with me, quickly! Joska has drowned! Fuck! Oh shit! HAVE ANOTHER DRINK, ON WHAT THE FUTURE WILL BRING! I always told you the booze would kill him. Wait, what if was the terrorist who killed him? Dude! There's no terrorist around here. It was Joska who was driving that van. What are you talking about, dude? It's the truth! Isn't it, Bronya? What has he done to you, dude? Joska is barely dead and you're already smearing him. Why would I make up something like that? He was drunk and didn't hit the brakes. Bronya? You're fucking crazy... Bronya, shit, say something! How could it have been Joska? Where did you get this? You bastard! I wanted to put this in the van... ALLAH IS GREAAAT ...so they wouldn't think it was Joska. Standa, please, don't tell them. But Bronya… Why should people be afraid for no reason? What do you mean "for no reason"? Standa, what the fuck? This could happen anytime for real! People are alert now! But if you tell them, they won't give a shit about migrants again! I wish it'd explode here one day. And the people would realize what kind of bastards they are. So tomorrow at eight, okay? EASTER MONDAY I have been thinking about it at home, and it must have been the terrorists. The van crashed into the fountain, Joska drowned in the fountain. It all makes sense. Well, it surely sounds better than Standa's bullshit yesterday. He regularly got scared, the Deputy of the Commander! Let's go already! I said at eight, so eight sharp. Guys! I want to be a fireman too! FIRE STATION Let's go. Hey! Someone knocked the fridge over... Milan? I know who did it. Where are you going and what are you transporting? Mind your own business, you clown! Who are you calling a clown? Who do you think you are, you…? Stop banging on it! Dear fellow citizens! I have great news for you. I have been informed by a reliable source that the driver of the van was our local drunkard Joska. Guys! Guys, it's over! Go get drunk! Let's go! There is no terrorist! Our village is safe again! Who the hell are you, pricks? I have been informed by a reliable source... that the driver of the van was our local drunkard Joska. … that the driver of the van was our local drunkard Joska. Fucking hell! There is no terrorist! There is nothing to be afraid of! Our village is safe again! I wish you wonderful Easter holidays! Milan Růžička, your mayor! There she is! It all makes sense now. Joska used to bathe in the fountain, who else would hit it? Look, Standa! Dude, you were right! Where is Bronya? He was feeling kind of down, so he left. Smile, my boy! Life is beautiful, we are free! The marble cake smells really good! -Help yourself! -May I? Jesus Christ! To Joska! He hit the only gypsy in the village! Bronya, I swear… I didn't tell anyone else! I wanted to, but I didn't. Come on, be happy! Be glad it's peace again. Standa, peace means to have things under control. Peace is all I want. Until Friday, I saw only one solution. To join Maruna as soon as possible. And be gone for good. But after the accident... I felt it would be selfish… I am here for the people. And now it's all fucked up. People won't believe anything anymore. People are stupid. They'll believe anything. If you cut down our tree and put your paper there, you'd have them back where they were before. -Our tree? Are you insane? -It was just an example. Shit, let's do it! What? Bronya, don't be silly! It's our tree, the symbol of our village! Exactly. Bronya, wait! Fuck the axe. Wait here, I'll show you something. I can do it! I can do it! Yes I can! Ouch! Fuck! Come on! Fall down! You little fucker! Come on! Hello? What? Already? I'm on my way! Wait for me! Hello… I was hit by a tree. And a chapel… Jana? Sorry… Jana, I am sorry. I didn't make it. Dude, you're here already? Holy shit! A clear attack on Christian culture! Hello, little Standa! Thank you! What happened to you, Father? A strike of God's providence. I am a father, Father. I have a son! I will pray for him. There is nothing more beautiful than the birth of life! This time you have a huge proof! I hope you'll go after that fucker really hard this time! For intentional bodily harm, the perpetrator could face a sentence of 6 months up to 3 years. If it's proven as an act of terrorism, he can face 5 to 15 years in prison. I'd give him a life sentence. Or hang him! 3800 grams, 52 centimeters! Wow, what a huge bub! I can show him to you tomorrow. Jana asked for discharge. Could you drive me? Tomorrow is a workday, I have to go to work. -I expected you to be more happy. -I am. If we hadn't had our new father here, I wouldn't have opened today. Especially since it happened so close to the pub. Stop it! Poor Father. You see, and he wanted to forgive them… At least they opened his eyes, sons of bitches! You haven't heard about it? What? They cut down the tree when he was praying there… It was a regular assassination attempt. Okay, guys! To our new father Standa! And to our future fellow fireman, the little Standa! Cheers! To the father and the son! A NORMAL TUESDAY Standa, you did the laundry? What a skillful man I have! What's wrong? Is this your car? Do you have the keys? I do… It's my friend's car, I just borrowed it. It will be forfeited as a piece of evidence. Your friend confessed. It looks like he has become the first Czech terrorist. The keys, please. The keys, please! So it was Bronya... Fuck! I smell vinegar.
