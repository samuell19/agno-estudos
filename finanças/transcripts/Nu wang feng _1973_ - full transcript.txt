Before the house came out, here's a desert. There's a little timber work at the center of it. Once a man escaped to here and Hid a pot under the ground besides the timber Inside the pot was 300 gold dollars It's a big money at the present time Who was that man? A thief I don't think he's a sort of good guy. But he's my brother. So you're the samething of the kind of your brother Shut up Why this stuff is not seen yet? How do you know it was in here? At his expired moment my brother gave me a chart I spent a year long time to look after it I discovered this place's the timber-work situated I figured it out the exact point By drawing the cord this afternoon. So you'd have to fool me that The plantation's particular about the linear order? The mistress' falled into my trap I've got to dig those gold dollars out Master, master. Master, master. Master, master. Shiao-yen I saw him He's the master, I saw him It's the master, the master How can it be wrong?

He's died for years Mrs. Wang saw the ghost, and so did I What shall I do?... I saw him, I saw it with my own eyes. Didn't you say he's sitting in the book-room? It's a false one merely a skull Skull? I just don't believe it. Believe or not, go up there, and have a look. You should say this' a skull. What's the matter with Shiao-yen! I wish you won't fall down while walking Nobody'd take care of you if you're injured To my dismay. I'm blessed. Where's the rose-garden? It's near the Bridge Just tell me what kind of rose you like best? And I'll do the bargain with them. To protect those flowers in the garden The first problem is come to that two dogs lt'd be nothing if the man were bitten But you'd waste money and labours for the flowers I'll have Lie tie them up If it weren't the dogs I wouldn't have fallen down last night My plants' almost pulled off when whey jumped on me lt'd be funny enough to see you Wearing no pants on. Yellow rose, what a big one. There're many bees there. She's certainly a beautiful queen bee What you mean "Queen" The queen's the king in their hive She's the female and lives by the males In other words, she's made use of them She'll slay them soon as her goal's attained Nonsense. How'd she get a sword? The thorn in her mouth's as sharp as a sword Who? It's me. You're still sitting up? I don't want to sleep. Why? I'm planning to leave here At the end of this month when I get the pay Why do you've to wait for that money I'll give you the rate of 20% If you can help me to find those gold dollars No, I'm afraid of the dogs That's why I want your help All you've to do is kept in watching them On, you dogs be the good boys Oh, no, don't fool around There...

I've only found a hat Where did you find it? I dug it out at the corner of a wall Where? Show me hurriedly. You'd better go home first I don't think a man'd be hid under the ground. Who's talking down there? What's it? You've to break the sleep of master? It's happened by my propose to Shiao-yen And she brushed me off. You damn fool. Come on up then. Mistress. You...

She's only 18 Mistress, at this time a man like me is here Don't you think it's not good for you? Whom do you care? The master? He won't see anything if we're in bed, Under the doverlet with the light turning off He won't come over? He can't. He's got a bad coccyx He can't walk along nor lie down to sleep Out sit up there rocking... rocking on his chair Mistress. Are you sent me up at this time Just for showing me how to propose to women? First, you must know, the place for proposing Isn't in garden, but in bed. Secondly, the way of proposing Is by loving not by talking Thirdly, the opportunity of proposing Isn't too much but a moment. Would any body say against me Should I propose to you with these 3 points Nobody could object it as long as I said yes And then you? Object? You though I would? In the matter of love and to be loved Who's got the right to object? Even if any man? Yes, any man. Honest enough Honesty's a part of my beauty Beautiful Your delicate, warm secret skin captured my heart That's why you're lived in such a big house Ridding such a modern sedan And getting married with such a rich husband Husband... Mention that damn word no more Then, I'd be damned someday later To compare with him it isn't the something You're so young while he's so old. You are so handsome and he's so ugly He can only rock there while you're in bed. He even daren't call me up on phone I-ting The mice again.

And then put us to die with your thorn You want to be a queen bee Mistress, no, I'd call you rose. Please, stop all those tricks It's no need for you to accompany that chair And watch over that photograph Why don't you go to find a man? Who's better than Tasen and me to get married Rose, rose, you're nice and pretty You want money, don't you? I can tell you, I've dug a treasure in your garden That is great deal of gold dollars. Who gave you the right to dig in my garden? My brother did He hid a pot of gold in here 8 years ago. Then you're deceiving me too Your weren't here for driving I did it to you isjust like you did to me You are not allowed to dig in my garden No, you can't. Gold, gold, a great deal of gold.

I'm glad she did it as she's told And that always make me happy You tell a lie, you saw nothing Because you daren't believe you're the cuckold Didn't you see there's a painting across the bed? I was staying behind it Watching her taught you the way of proposing What's the hell, you've to do this? According to the psychologist This' the abnormality I thought you're exactly the abnormality No, not abnormal, but an impotent He's the champion in sword contest I began to know that he's such a sad dog Good for nothing after marriage But he don't let go of me He'd injure my face whenever I want go He's a devil with his sword I'd be killed soon as his sword is moving up So he'd be under the disguise of death And hide out behind that painting Peeping you, me, Tasen, and the others. To share the happiness of yours. No, I'm not happy. I hate the men, yes, I hate them. Every man includes you. I'm by the name of his wife But in fact, I'm taken as a prostitute, An animal under his knife Suffering for his passions and pleasures. I want to leave here in every single minute I'm willing to go anywhere but leave here I want to be free Leave and free. Didn't you see...

I-ting Nobody'd live of my sword I'm not the others but your wife You want to leave me behind Even since the day we got married For my defect, I had told you Just gave me the time for curing You'd go with man behind me That made me feel low, faceless And I was forced to see those damn tricks Behind that painting in secret. I defeated so many big boys I was acknowledged as a hero, a king But now all I'd do is left behind that painting How'd I stand to let you go? I'll put you to die under my sword No, don't touch her. Leave me alone... I don't care you kill anybody, but her. She's the goodness, the venus in my eyes. Help, help me Mr. Lie You love her too? I love her. I'm crazy about her.
