Found him this morning. (suspenseful orchestral music) The second time, Senor Chase. First Coyar, now Simbron. Not good for us, not good. - Same tribe? - Yes. See the cut. Here, and here. Totec. They don't let you run. - Did Simbron have any family? - I don't know. - [Man] No, senor. - All right, I'll see to it that he gets a proper burial. Now you men get back to work. - Back to work! Back to work, muchachos. (speaking foreign language) (grunting) (speaking foreign language) (grunting) (grunting) (water splashing) (speaking foreign language) - Hold on a second. Just let me get a score. Gracias, amigo. - I was assured that the construction site was in a controlled area. - It is. - It's inhabited by Totec. - Never asked who it was controlled by, did you? Senor Chase, Totec never seen no tourist hotel going up before. Bound to be a little curious. - Now their curiosity has killed two of my workers. - Two? (laughing) Two ain't bad. - I want them removed. Now. And I want you to do it. - Senor Chase, the Totec has citizens. Santa Del Sol, Mexico. Even if they ain't aware of it. - Who's gonna complain? - Imagine they might. - Their presence jeopardizes the construction of a project in which I have a substantial dollar investment. A project that could transform this primitive pimple of a state into the next Puerto Vallarta. - Ah, I hate Vallarta. Too many Americans. (laughing) - Thanks. - Anytime, my friend. - I suppose you have tall boots, calf high. - Several pair. - Bring those tomorrow night. They had some pilfering of supplies. You'll be in charge of security. - Says fucking who? - The Ministry of Land Resources after I call tomorrow and recommend you for the job. Tall boots. Protect those tendons. Goodnight my friend. - Senor Chase. - Hm? - Got me thinking. - Did I? (mysterious orchestral music) (gun firing) (grunting) (gun firing) (yelling) Totec. - Yeah. Care for a pop? - What am I paying you guys for? - Can't get too near a dying Totec. Something to do with their spirits. - Their spirits? - Yeah immortality, reincarnation. Totec are supposed to live forever. They believe a man's soul escapes to another body in his dying breath. (laughing) What's the matter, Senor Chase? Never killed no one? (intense orchestral music) (gun firing) Quite the marksman. (laughing) The men certainly earned their pay today, Senor Chase. - Are you sure that's the lot of them? - The Totec are no more. May God forgive us. - I don't need forgiveness. I can live with myself. - Oh I hope someday I can. (mysterious orchestral music) (grunting) (grunting) (gagging) (intense orchestral music) (grunting) (gun firing) (screaming) (groaning) (screaming) (grunting) (gasping) (breathing heavily) - [Cop] I wouldn't count on seeing Lieutenant today, Ray. - Ah, I can take a hint. You mind if I get a cup of coffee before I go? - Just be outta here when I get back, okay? - Your husband left on his own. He'll come back if and when he wants to come back. I understand your concern, but it's like I told you on the phone. - Yeah, I know. It's out of your jurisdiction, there's no evidence that the crime took place. - That's right, Mrs. Weeks. Now, if you'll excuse me. - Thanks for all your help, Lieutenant. - Excuse me, Mrs. Weeks! Hi. Ray Tattinger, from Bureau Investigations. I couldn't help overhearing your conversation inside. If you're looking to find somebody, I'm your man. You've got a heck of a place here, Mrs. Weeks. - I wish Julian felt the same. He lost his job, I was paying all the bills, I guess he resented it. He messed his head up so he left to sort things out. - So, when'd he leave? - About five months ago. Last time he called he was doing construction working his way south. - When did he say he was coming home? - Last week of August. Promised. He was anxious to get back. - Four weeks ago-- Mmmm. - What are your fees? - 100 a day per diem, plus travel which is about two thirds of the going rate for a licensed investigator and, you know, cafe's not doing so good? - [Nora] It's been better. - It just so happens I'm heading up north in another case, no need to charge twice for travel expenses, only one Ray Tattinger. (chuckling) - I only got a couple of hundred dollars in cash. Can I send you a check for the balance? - Sure. You know, Nora, Mrs. Weeks. You know, some folks do drop out intentionally. They abandon cars, homes, businesses, wives. Especially wives, when there's a third party involved. - Now you're sounding like Lieutenant Fladboe. - Could he be right? - No, he could not. (hard rock music) - Have you seen this fella? Haven't seen this gut, have ya? Has this guy been around? Damn. (coughing) Man, is it hot. Good thing you got air conditioning. - [Leslie] Yours? - No. It's a loaner. Jag is in the shop. - It's parked in my space. - Huh? - It's parked in my space. - Color me gone. (engine revving) - [Woman] All yours, 4:45 this afternoon. - Okay. - [Woman] Thank you. - [Leslie] Who was he? - Mr. Tattinger? - The man in the Chevrolet. - [Woman] He was just a claims adjuster. - [Leslie] For whom? - Imperial Mutual Insurance. - First, we have no affiliation with a company of this name. - Well that explains it. He was looking for someone we didn't even have on file. - And second, insurance is spelled A-N-C-E, not E-N-C-E. Now who again was he looking for? - Mr. Weeks, W-E-E-K-S. Julian R. (metal screeching) - Thank you. (ominous orchestral music) (whooshing) - [Julian] Babe. (Nora laughing) Come on Nora, smile.

I didn't mean to put you out. - Honestly, you didn't. There were no records? - Well, the guys at the LCC site said he worked there. The gal in the office said he didn't, at least she couldn't find any paperwork on him. You said something came up, you wanna talk about it? "Notice of impound, Cooks Towing, 82 Mazda." Julian's. Well, looks like I head back up there first thing in the morning. What if he doesn't come back, Nora? What then? - I think we'll have to assume he'll be back, Ray. (mysterious orchestral music) (door rattling) - Help you? - If you're Cooks. - [Duane] Well, Cooks died. - That's too bad, so who sends this out? - Well, I guess I did. - Well, you aren't sure? - [Duane] Who are you? - Ray Tattinger, First Imperial Bank. We're executives of an estate that names Mr. Weeks as a beneficiary. We got a nice little stash for him if we could only find him. Mind if I have a look inside? There might be something in there to help me find this fella. - You see this here car was locked when I found it, and it's supposed to stay that way. - Yeah, but I have the impound notice. - Yeah, but you see, you ain't the registered owner, you see, you ain't Julian R. Weeks. - I bet Mr. Weeks would appreciate it. - Now, you see, now, I better not, because they come down pretty damn hard in thus business, they think we're all crooks as it is. (laughing) - Mind telling me where you picked it up? - In town, it was abandoned. - How long ago? - Not long, a couple weeks. Well thank you, sir. (suspenseful orchestral music) (lock clicking) - Okay. Nice carwash. (seat squishing) (glass breaking) Wait, wait, wait! (intense orchestral music) (screaming) (grunting) - Hey, hey, hey, hey. (grunting) - Stupid son of a bitch! (drill whirring) Tell me, Duane. Nine yards worth. - You're trespassing, man. I come back for my wallet, and I found you breaking into my-- - Tell me about the blood. - Blood? What the fuck are you talking about? - [Ray] Inside the Mazda. - You're out of your mind. I ain't never once been in that truck. Never once, you asshole. - Don't rope me, you little gink. I pull this trigger, you'll be backin' up the urinals the rest of your life. (muttering) What? - I said, you won't do it, man. (drill whirring) (screaming) I just pick em' up! He tells me to, I just pick em' up! - He? Who's he? Got anything to drink around here, Duane? - Now, you listen, now just like I said, he calls me up, he tells me what year and make, and where to find it. And you know it shows up, it's right there abandoned. So, tow em' in, and we send out notices, and Eileen auctions them off in 90 days. - Who's he? - I don't know. I ain't never seen him. - How'd you meet him? - [Duane] He calls me up. - How'd he get your number? - Fuckin' Yellow Pages, I don't know. - How'd you get his cut? - He don't take no cut. (laughing) - He just unloads cars. - Hey. Hey this is all legal, man. - It's legal, if you've got Shredded Wheat for brains. Haven't you ever wondered why these cars don't have owners, why nobody picks them up? - Now, see this guy, and maybe we got an arrangement. You see, he don't take no cut. - And you don't ask any questions. You fuck. - I mean would you? - Yeah, Duane, I would. (sighing) - Okay, so, what are we saying here? - So, what are we saying here? (chuckling) What I'm saying here is next time he calls you, you call me and call me soon, Duane, I don't hear from you soon, Duane, cops will be so far down your throat you'll be crapping blue. (suspenseful orchestral music) (spooky whispering) (intense drum music) (breathing heavily) (grunting) (gasping) (spooky whispering) (phone ringing) Ray Tattinger, how can I help? - [Duane] He called. Now listen to me. I want this car man, because it just sounds too good to be true. - [Ray] Tell me. - [Duane] It's a Porsche 924, red, S-T-H-9-2-1. - [Ray] Address? - [Duane] Now I gotta make this pick up man, otherwise he ain't gonna call me no more and I lose out on the whole shebang. - [Ray] You can tow tomorrow morning after I look at it. - [Duane] Now look, that's not the-- - [Ray] The address, Duane. - [Duane] 900 Ravenwood, it's north of Everett. (mysterious orchestral music) (suspenseful orchestral music) - Oh please, come on. God, let me go home. (intense orchestral music) (screaming) (breathing heavily) (knife stabbing) (grunting) (whispering) - [Goldie] Hi, Nora. - Hey. - Still need a ride? - Yeah. My car won't be ready for a couple of days. - Okay. - Do you mind if we swing by Alamo Street first? - No great, let's go. - Okay. - I've had it. If I don't make a sale soon, I'm getting out of real estate. This is definitely not one of my neighborhoods, Nora. - 721 Alamo Street, it's gotta be here. - Well, maybe it's in the executive washroom. - Here we go. Whoa. - Oh. - Hi, can I help you? - Looking for Ray Tattinger. (chuckling) - He owe you money? - Not exactly. - I thought you gave him 500 bucks. - I didn't give it to him, it was a retainer. (chuckling) - Well congratulations, lady. You are the latest and the greatest contributor to the Ray Tattinger early retirement fund. - Are you saying he moved? - I'm saying he split. Took off about a week ago, never came back. Don't expect he will neither. Tell you what, the Salvation Army's coming in. Why don't you take what you want, you know, cut your losses. 500 bucks, wow. - Nora, you don't want any of this crap. - I want the picture. - What picture? - The one of Julian. I got it. Look. - Maybe he forgot to cash it. - Would you leave your money all over town? - Are you insane? I gotta get outta here. (rock music) (laughing) (screaming) - [Newscaster] In the Lancaster area where the grizzly discovery was made, the remains, believed to be male 25 to 40 years of age, have been removed by the county coroners who will attempt to identify the body. The five day forecast of cold nights and sunny days will continue throughout the week. - [Man On Phone] Directory assistance. - [Nora] The number to the coroner's office? - [Man On Phone] 5-5-5-2-9-7-8. (phone dialing) - [Woman On Phone] County coroner. - I'm calling regarding the body that was reported on the news? - [Woman On Phone] All I can tell you over the telephone is he's a male Hispanic. For more information you can come down here between the hours of eight and five. - No thanks. - [Goldie] I'm almost positive this address was in the new multiple listing book. Even in the dark it looks great. What a commission this would be. - So this would have to be it. Only one Ravenwood on the map. But why did he write it down? Could be from a different case. - Wonder if we could do a walkthrough. - I wonder if we could get a closer look. - Don't you have the key, aren't you the real estate lady? - Yeah? - And Mr. Chase didn't leave you the key to the gate? - He told us he would leave us a key, but he forgot it, so like him. - I'm sure he wouldn't mind if you let us in. Would he? - Yeah, no problem. - [Nora] So? - It's locked, let's look around. (mysterious orchestral music) (grunting) Nobody's home, look around for a lockbox. - I did, I couldn't find one. - Oh great, I love breaking into houses. You know, this works on some doors. If you just slip this into this thingy here, push it down, pull it out. Voila, access. Don't you have a gold card? - Did you hear something inside? - Such as? - I don't know. - [Leslie] The Sedan, it's yours? - Uh, the blue one, yes, mine, ours, mine. - Just the two of you? - Just us. I'm Goldie and this is-- - The gardener let you in? - Look, I'm a realtor. We were just out canvasing the area, looking for some new listings. The gardener thought we were someone else and we took advantage of the mistake by peeking in a few windows, that's all. We were just admiring your house. You are selling. - I am. - Great. My company represents a very exclusive clientele and I would love to sit down and talk to you sometime. - I have a broker. - Just in case you change your mind? - The man has a broker, Goldie. - You'll have to excuse me. It's not everyday I find two beautiful women prowling around my house, you threw me. - Well I can understand that. - For the record, the house isn't an exclusive listing. Since I am interested in a quick sale, perhaps we should talk. Goldie, was it? - Still is. - If you got a minute, why don't you come inside? You can poke around to your heart's content. Please, won't you join us? (ominous orchestral music) (breathing heavily) no, please no more. You're not here. I am. Go away! (grunting) (glass breaking) (mysterious orchestral music) (breathing heavily) (dramatic orchestral music) (metal clattering) (suspenseful orchestral music) (groaning) (intense orchestral music) (grunting) (grunting) (breathing heavily) (intense orchestral music) (yelling) (screaming) (knife stabbing) (gagging) (water running) You're very adept at that. Forgive me, I didn't mean to startle you. - How did you get in? - The backdoor was unlocked. - It was? - Chase, Leslie Chase. - Yes, I remember. - It's a great place. Imagine my surprise to find out that you're not in real estate. - Actually Goldie and I are old friends, I was just along for the ride. - I see. Almost forgot. I found this by the door at my house. (ominous orchestral music) You really should be more careful. - Mrs. Hardwick, good morning. (chuckling) Still no tulips? - Few weeks yet hun, I've brought you some roses. Last longer anyway. - Always a saleslady. - [Mrs. Hardwick] Any word yet from your young man, Julian? - Not yet. - Don't you dare give up on him. - Does that sound like me? - No, I imagine it doesn't. (chuckling) Nope, nope, nope, nope. - Please. Please Mrs. Hardwick. Let's not go through this again Mrs. Hardwick, take the money. - Just come visit me sometime. - Still over on Lion's Road? - Same address for 32 years, imagine I'll die there. (laughing) - See if I can't stop by first. - Fair enough. (dramatic orchestral music) - Showed some Polaroids around the office today. Everyone says that house is a giveaway at $750,000. I'm gonna have to ask Leslie if he'll come up. - Has he even mentioned Ray Tattinger? - No, but I'll ask him tonight if you want me to. - Tonight? - Yeah, he called to ask if I was free. (laughing) I said, "Maybe cheap, but never free." - You're seeing Chase socially? - Honey, business. - That doesn't look too tax deductible. - Well, I just wanted to wear it. I don't get many chances, you know. - [Nora] Listen Goldie, there's something about Chase you should know-- - No, I know everything. I ran a credit check on him, Leslie Christian Chase. Came up unmarried and incredibly wealthy. So for me, life ceases to be an issue. - [Nora] Listen, he-- (knocking on door) - He's here, let him in. - [Nora] You're dressed. - I know, I want to make an entrance.

But she's my best friend, I don't want to see her hurt. - [Goldie] Are you always right on time? - It's a vice I have. - [Goldie] Well I hope it's not your only one. - I'm sure we'll see you again, Mrs. Weeks. ♪ Just give up on love ♪ ♪ But the only way I'll ever end this ♪ ♪ Darkness inside ♪ ♪ Is to try to find a way to make you mine ♪ (door clicking) - So she hired a detective and then he split on her. - She went to the police? - Yeah, but, they told her the same thing that I did. That Julian would come home when and if he was good and ready. But you gotta understand Nora, I mean, she was seriously in love. This is a girl who didn't wash the sheets for a month after Julian left. She didn't want to wash his scent away. - But she thinks something serious happened to him? - I guess so. I guess it's easier for her pride that way. Oh, goodbye Mr. Diet. - You look wonderful in blue, have I told you that? - Hey, you don't want any of these critters? - I'm trying to cut down on red meat. Save room for dessert. (mysterious orchestral music) - [Ray] The guys at the LCC site said he worked there. The gal at the office said he didn't, or at least she couldn't find any paperwork on it. - [Nora] LCC. Leslie Christian Chase. (door clicking) - Hey. Where you going? - My cars ready, finally. - Oh, you gonna walk to the shop? - Taxi. - Why didn't you come and get me? - Well, I know you got back pretty late last night. So how did it go? - Oh, what a guy. He goes around the world building all these buildings. He's done a lot of things, you know that scar he's got on his neck? I'm sure you've noticed, it's his only flaw. Well he got that during a fight with some Indian warrior in Santa Del something, I don't know, it was the jungle somewhere, right? I mean who do we know that's ever been to the jungle, let alone attacked by the natives. I was impressed. - I can see. A Native American spokesman denies any tribal involvement. W. Dykstra. Hey, Mrs. Dysktra? - Yeah, who are you? - Nora Weeks, got a minute? - How? - I read your stories, four bodies discovered-- - Five. - A fifth body? - Look, I'm a little crazy here. - Wait, my husband's missing. I know something's happened to him, and there's no one to help me. Please tell me what you know. - Okay, let me give it to you straight. Each of the victims had their ankle tendons cut. - That hasn't been in the paper. - Sometimes we're asked to suppress certain facts that are relevant to the case. Like something the murderer might know? It's a clever idea, really. I mean a victim can't run away. But there's just no history of that kind of mutilation in our local tribes, there's just no history of... - But what? (ominous orchestral music) - All right. My source indicated to me off the record that they found some rather unexpected marks on the femur of the latest victim. - Marks, what kind of marks? - Tooth marks. - Animal? - Human. - In Pre-Columbian Mesoamerica, the Totec believed that men was born from the flesh of the dead. It was the nourishment of their existence, and for 20 days based on their sacred ritual calendar, a human sacrifice was to be made. A chieftain would select a victim, have him stripped, painted blue, the sacrificial color and led them to the temple of the jaguar. The chief will make offerings of his own blood to the tribe, drinking it just prior to executing the victim. With the heart still beating, the body was flayed, and the flesh eaten by the tribesmen. Hunted to extinction, no survivors of this ancient civilization are known to exist. Totec Chieftain, Santa Del Sol, Mexico. (intense orchestral music) (book thudding) (eerie ambient music) (knocking on door) (hairdryer blowing) Why don't you answer? - [Goldie] Had a hairdryer in my ear. - [Nora] You're going out with Chase? - Uh huh. - [Nora] You can't, he's dangerous. Well so am I in this dress. Look at this, Russian sable. Feel it, there's only a hundred coats like this in the world, and guess who gave it to me? - And you accepted it? Did he tell you he came to see me before he went out with you? He's using you to get to me. - Oh really? 'Cause he couldn't possibly be interested in just me? - I didn't say that. Goldie, you've known him for a few weeks. We known each other for years, I wouldn't lie to you. You know the bodies they're digging up? They all have ankle tendons cut. - What are you talking about? - Chase told you he built a hotel in Mexico, right? - Yeah. - There were rumors at the time that he built it on the sacred land of the Totec, did he tell you that? Did he tell you about the tendons? - Totecs, tendons? (laughing) Whoa. - Listen to this. "Amongst the last predatory tribes "of Central America was the Totecs. "Unique in their death rituals, "disabling their victim by the precise severing "of the ankle tendons." Goldie, these bodies, they had their flesh removed and they found human tooth marks on the bones. - So you're suggesting, no, no Nora. Don't even say it. - It's obvious, isn't it? - Listen to yourself. Leslie Chase, he's got everything. He's got cash, he's got cars, he's got a great house, he's got a job that takes him around the world. Why would he need to kill someone? - What about Ray Tattinger? Christ, it's like he ends where Chase begins. And you didn't even-- - I asked. Leslie never met him. - What about Julian? He was working construction for the company called LCC. Ring a bell? Leslie Christian Chase. - He's late. He's never late. - I hope I'm wrong for about 10 different reasons. Not the least of which is Julian. But please Goldie, stay away from him until we know I'm wrong. (knocking on door) - Lock up for me? - Goldie. - I think he really likes me, honey. I really do. Hi. - [Leslie] Hello. - So what are we doing tonight? - There's a cocktail party I should attend. - How about if we skip it and go back to your place? (chuckling) (door clicking) (ominous orchestral music) (sensual orchestral music) (breathing heavily) (gasping) (moaning) (ominous orchestral music) (moaning) (screaming) - [Woman On Phone] Nobody's seen or heard from her for a couple of days now. - She didn't say anything about leaving, quitting? - [Woman On Phone] No, not to us. - She was in the middle of a deal. - [Woman On Phone] You mean the place out on Ravenwood? - Yes. - [Woman On Phone] Well, that sold. (dog barking) - Goldie? (knocking on door) Goldie? (knocking on door) (glass breaking) (suspenseful orchestral music) (gasping) I've gotta talk to the Lieutenant. - You can't, he's busy. Hey. - Do you know a man named Leslie Chase? - Mrs. Weeks. - Do you? - The developer, lives over on Ravenwood, about 35, 40. Standing right behind you. - Hello, Nora. Just making a few final arrangements with Lieutenant Fladboe here. He's agreed to keep an eye on the house while it's In Escrow. - Do you know this woman? - Yes, she's, how do I put this tactfully, former lover. - [Nora] I'm not your God damn lover! - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, jumpin' Jesus, what the hell is going on here? - I'd prefer if we could solve our problems in private, Nora, not put them on display like this in front of a judge. - He's a murderer. I told you my husband's missing. I hire Ray Tattinger to find him, now he's gone too. - Lady, apparently you're the only one who didn't know. Ray is a flake. Probably moved his little operation to another town by now. - Okay, well, my best girlfriend-- - Goldie's fine. We're vacationing together, or will be. I'll be joining her as soon as I wrap up a-- - Bullshit. Why didn't you take her coat? - The fur? It's a little warm in Hawaii. - Let's call her. If she's in Hawaii, let's get her on the phone. I want to talk to Goldie now. - I don't think that's possible. - Because you're lying. - Because I believe she has a sailing lesson 'til about five. - He's the guy. He's the one who is putting all those bodies out there in the fields. I know, I've been to his house. I found blood. - Mrs. Weeks, real calm now. Why do you say he's killing people, and why is he doing it? - Because-- - This should be interesting. - Because he's-- - Yes? - You son of a bitch! - I usually like to keep personal matters personal, but this is a bad situation. Involvement, she and her best friend, you know how they get. They'll say anything to get back at you. - Yeah, I know. (suspenseful orchestral music) (tape rewinding) - [Goldie] Aloha! I'm in Hawaii honey, do you believe it? Leslie sold the house through another agent so I lost the sale but I got the guy. Uh look, Nora, I should've left you a note, I'm sorry if you got worried okay? I'll make it up to you when I get back. If I get back. I'm not sure if this is a vacation or a retirement. I'll try you later, honey. (machine beeping) - Nora, maybe now you'll listen to reason. We need to talk, away from things. At the wildlife sanctuary at the state park. Tomorrow, sunrise. Quite a place, isn't it? I'm one of its patron saints. I have my name on a plaque, somewhere. I'll be leaving soon, but I wanted to see if we couldn't work out our situation first. - I have nothing to work out with you. - Are you sure of that? - Positive. You wanted to talk, so talk. - I've never spoken about this to anyone. Dying Totec chieftain will breathe his final breath into the mouth of his successor. His spirit has passed on in that breath, that last gasp. Along with the souls of all the chieftains who have come before him. Years ago, I became that which I sought to destroy. In order to preserve the lineage of their souls, they keep me alive. And they have needs, needs which must be satisfied. - Interesting mythology. - It's no myth. I need your silence. And I'm willing to bargain for it. - You have nothing I want. - I have Goldie. And if you want her to live, there could be no more episodes like the one yesterday. No police, no accusations, ever. - You killed Ray Tattinger? - The detective? - And Julian? Answer me damn it. Did you? - You're the only one that could end this curse from me, Nora. Do it. The Totec believe that during a dream the person's nagual leaves his body to seek out other souls, souls to whom they are linked. - That's insane. - I can't stop them. Do it. Do it! - Oh God. I want to, but it's no way I'm going to become what you are. - I killed him. I killed Julian, and I let him suffer. (Nora sobbing) You're the only one that can end this curse from me, Nora. Do it. (knocking on door) - Naureen! My goodness. Do I have to post visiting hours? Well come on, come on. There. Better? Wanna talk? You've heard from Julian, haven't you? How is he? - He's not coming back. - Your young man's not in any trouble, is he, girl? If he is, maybe you should talk to the police. - I tried, they didn't believe me. - Doesn't mean I wouldn't. You know, I haven't shared a bed for 16 years. Not since Mr. Hardwick fell face down in the yard and neglected to get back up. But there's half a mattress going to waste in the bedroom. It's yours for the night if you want it. - Thanks. I'm fine right here. - Fair enough. There's a blanket there. Another nip of Sherry? - Mm-hmm. - Now typically I beat the sun up. So if I'm gone when you wake, you just help yourself to the Cream of Wheat. Oh, and I'll leave the spare door key for you if I can remember where the hell I hid the damn thing. Here somewhere. Here it is. Anyway, you can stay as long as you like. Might be nice to have some company! Do my image some good too. (chuckling) The neighborhood kids think I'm a bit spinsterly as it is. Did I say spinsterly? Hell, they think I'm a witch! (laughing) Well, I suppose every neighborhood has to have one. Ours did back in Iowa. Her name was Mrs. Chillingsly. Quite a name. She was always-- (water running) (footsteps thudding) - I'm listening. (door clicking) Is everything all right? Is everything all right? Mrs. Hard-- (intense orchestral music) Hello, police? Yes, I want to report a murder. Yes a murder. Yes, I'm sure! 3224 Rollins Drive. Please, please hurry. (group murmuring) - [Cop] Okay. C-H-A-S-E. - Leslie Chase. He lives up north, Ravenwood Road. - Mm-hmm. Okay I'm sorry, I just want to go through this one more time. This guy comes in through the kitchen door, attacks the owner of the property, Mrs. Hard-- - Mrs. Hardwick, and she was here in the kitchen. - Right. So he attacks Mrs. Hardwick then he leaves. You come in, you discover the body, then you leave. You go to the nearest phone, you call it in at 23:47. Now according to dispatch, the first unit arrives at 23:52. That's five minutes later. They discover nothing, nada. No sign of entry, no sign of a struggle, and no Mrs. Hardwick. - He put her in the sink. - The sink? - In the sink so he could wash the blood away. - What? - [Officer] It's Lieutenant Fladboe, he knows Mr. Chase. - We're out here. No, I'm with her right now. All right. Okay. That explains everything, all right, fine. (phone beeping) (sighing) Here's what we're gonna do. We'll look for Hardwick. In the meantime, I'll make sure that you get home safely. (police radio chattering) (sighing) (siren whooping) (suspenseful orchestral music) (phone ringing) - [Nora] Hi, neither Julian or I can come to the phone right now. Please leave a message so we can call you back. (machine beeping) Chase, it's me. I know you're in my apartment. So listen, you win. I won't say anything, not to the police, not to anyone. I wish to God I could kill you but I can't. So go home, Chase, it's over. (thunder crashing) (suspenseful orchestral music) (clattering) (gun firing) (gasping) (gun clicking) (glass shattering) (Nora yelling) (thunder crashing) (breathing heavily) (thunder rumbling) (whooshing) (grunting) (yelling) (intense orchestral music) (screaming) (grunting) (panting) (groaning) (grunting) (thunder crashing) (panting) (groaning) (yelling) (grunting) (screaming) (screaming) (gagging) (grunting) - Freedom! (thunder crashing) (gasping) (breathing heavily) (thunder crashing) (thunder rumbling) (birds chirping) - This oughta help you feel better. (phone ringing) She's not here! (phone ringing) You think those leeches from the tabloids are ever gonna quit calling? - Help me up. - Where you going? - I've gotta stop by work. - Oh, Nora honey, come on. You don't need to do that, it's only been three days. They can get along without you. I still shudder when I think about how close we both came to, I never suspected, Nora. And I heard what you were saying, but it just didn't register. Hey, love may be blind, but I am here to tell you that lust is blind and deaf. And dumb. Really dumb. Anyway, I guess, I just haven't had the chance to say I'm sorry. I'm sorry for not believing you. And to thank you. Because baby, I really do owe you my life. (intense orchestral music) - I know. (intense orchestral music) (mysterious orchestral music) (Multicom Jingle)
