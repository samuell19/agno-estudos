Inspired by real facts The world is illuminated by fire. The machines are operated by hand, on foot or by steam. Engineer George Westinghouse gained immense wealth thanks to the invention of air brakes. He invested in natural gas, considered the future of lighting and industry. The inventor Thomas Edison, famous all over the world but penniless, works day and night on a superior alternative: electricity. They are about to compete to create the modern world. Guys! I hope you brought your checkbook. The air brakes are paying for the latest obsession of George. By changing the size of the pipes, you can move the 20 km gas. It's like shooting with a pistol. It's a good or bad thing, Mrs. Westinghouse? - How's your daughter, Gladys? - Oh, very well, thank you. She knew a financier. - The dress is decorating delicious. - It took two years... I read in The World that the electrical system of Mr. Edison It is considerably cheaper gas. This keeps you awake at night? There is always more to see. Mr. and Mrs. Worthington, Mr. Manesberg, Doctor and Mrs. Burton, Rev. Vincent, Signor McCoy, Mr. Faulk, Miss Faulk, enjoy the evening. Edison says that in a few months will illuminate the world. It's amazing, but it will take ten years to put it into practice. The newspapers I describe it as if it were something different. A miracle. As if we begin to Ievitare the ground. I'd love to meet him. You can think about you? - It's been several years. - A dinner. Quiet. Elegant. Pragmatics. Edison hates tie their shoes, let alone participate in a social event. Maybe you're right. But I myself try it. Something fascinating? Mr. Pennoyer found a deal for a building in Newport. The mother of Mrs. Abernathy died, and, apparently, Edison believes that it will never be night. The man who enlightened the world - Are you happy to know the President? - Yup. Do not say anything on the JP Morgan nose. - What's her nose? - Anything. - What's her nose? - It's huge. Huge. It's like they took a hammer and had they thrown in his face. - I thought you already got the money. - Only half. - Morgan know you'll be there too? - It will invest, as always. - You expect dinner with Westinghouse. - Thing? Dinner with Westinghouse. On the way back. Why stables are red? - Maybe see them better when it snows. - Why does the red paint costs less. Morgan wants to learn about the convenience of your system. I have the money. Enough for two buildings in Manhattan? - Yes. - Great! This was to be my lunch. The President has asked to see the person phonograph. I had no idea you were there too. Mrs. Edison. Mr. Morgan. Meet our children. Dot and Dash. Delicious. I know what you are doing. How much do you need? How much money do you want to take me away? Oh, as much as possible. Samuel lnsull. Personal secretary of Mr. Edison. Mr. Morgan, Mr. Edison. Which? He is Mr. Edison. Lunch is served. This is the sound of your voice. This really is my voice? I heard that you refused five million dollars. Thank you for the offer, Mr. President, but it is the kind of science that pursued which I find regrettable. There is always money in weapons. The only device that will not construct is what takes the life of a man. It's barbaric. Ma... look this. A square kilometer of Manhattan, the First District. And I will enlighten you. - There you are successful. - A star in a jar. A warm glow. Nothing stinks. Nothing harmful. Thirteen hours of light for each sphere, and it is more economic gas. And it is also safer. We use the cables with direct current. And those same cables will bring energy and heat. I need two buildings to install six dynamo of my building. He does not even reach my house. Morgan... I will make you so rich that you look back on this time and you may wonder why I was so disgustingly poor. It's all here. It will happen on Wall Street. In case you I lost it, will end up directly in the New York Times. Advertising for free. - One hundred and fifty. - Half a million. $ 500,000 and the next century will be bright, safe and yours. It seems fantastic, Pierpont. If I had your luck... With all due respect, you do not have it. (His nose looks like a cherry) - What's this? - Is not that nice. Morse Code. What did the kid? - My pleasure, Mr. President. - What did the kid? You know what you've done? Get more saying no. System by the Manhattan offices and a professional look. What does it mean? I do not know. Carpets... And I do not know. Carpets. And the name? Edison Electric obviously. Lord, why not build ammunition? Cirjque million. It's hard to say no. At the. If it is done by Edison, it will work. And if it works, I would prefer not to kill anyone. Quite right. Thomas Edison has a negative opinion of graduates looking for a job, because they fail to answer his exam questions. "Who composed Il Trovatore?" Verdi. "What is the speed of sound?" A trick question. Sound travels at a speed steadily declining. But I think the highest speed recorded is 343 mls. How do you know all this? I read it this morning. This is something different. Me I feel. You never invited guests before. Really? Among eight minutes we will be the junction station, sir. Dinner with Westinghouse. Let's go home. They are tired. I shook too many hands today. Good evening, F tank. George! Sorry? I will not stop. Agree. Maybe the brakes are broken. I doubt it. It's kind emergency in New York. Do not be disturbed by him. It did well. Before he became a magician, I did live in my basement. My wife I was sitting at the table only if it were washed first. Then, I gave him an ultimatum and he was left to eat alone. How does it work? You want to know the secret? Design your own reality and look for the needle in the haystack. And how do you know that there's a needle to look for? I do not know. And neither do you. But it is so determined to be the second person to find it, that I look stem to stem. I'll tell you one good thing about him. It could be the richest on Earth, but it does not care about the money. And what does it matter? (Sea)'- Speaks. - I want to test the resistance. - Where's my clip? - On your bureau. - What is a bureau? It's what's underneath your clip. Will I be able to make you promise to build me a fence? The ground is frozen. He must thaw. I ve been missing! It's a puppy! It is m Tom, come and see. Tor"! Tor"! You want half a million dollars? Made something with your name that I can sell to General Sherman. Counter Offer. And if I gave you what you want, but you gave me everything I want? We will become great, great, great! - Larger than an elephant? - Nobody stops an elephant! It will work. I must be sincere. It may not work. Common sense says that if you fail miserably, you better not do it in front of a crowd of people. New York Stock Exchange Tonight, things could change. And I hope so. If so... change there... and there. Me and my boys have caught in a jar what before only he shone in the night sky. How about removing the cover and see what happens? You are ready? Three, two... ear. It has only 30 meters of copper to 87 customers. Do not ever bring in revenue. It is a peri-rich hobby. Something to brag about. It should not have to be. I recorded the patents for the Siemens dynamo and the transformer Gaulard-Gibbs. Transformer? It looks more like a metal suitcase. How much cost? Edison has chosen the wrong horse. Its current is like a tube with a knot inside, It needs to sell a generator per kilometer. You want to build an AC system. It is too powerful for engines. Take off your doubts from head for a minute and tell me... How far do you think you can cover with one AC dynamo? - Some thousands. - The meters? Of kilometers. And how many houses can we reach? I guess all of them. And the bulbs? Hiram agreed to sell me his license. If you scrub Edison, do it right. - They have a grayish color. - I just want to do a demonstration. For Edison. I will choose a small town, somewhere in the countryside. And you understand that you can toggle. We become members. Our system, its bulbs. My opinion, based only on physical and reality, It is that you are only interesting chatter. - But I do not think are possible. - Why? Because otherwise I would have already done. My office in Paris believe that you are the only man able to compete with me. How would you like to work with me? Very very much. I will expand into 12 cities, - with DC systems... - Continue? The alternating current is much more efficient. Higher voltage. Greater distance. Less than copper wires. It is lethal, and it would be too powerful for an engine. I will give $ 100 a month, until you show you more or less worthy. - One hundred dollars? - If you solve me five dilemmas, I will pay $ 50,000 and then I'll fire you. Mr. Tesla Welcome to the Edison Electric. We make a small invention every ten days and a major invention every six months. I suspect that despite her husband's laboratory is a few hundred meters from your house, it is as if it were hundreds of kilometers away. No, a million. I looked for a way to stop his head. But keep thinking. It's something I can not control. I can only return to the center. I know that Mr. Edison has been called the worst husband of America, since she spent their wedding night in the lab. I too have heard that story. Well, our wedding night, Tom and I we sull'Albany parties. The ship. We spent a week at Niagara Falls. I thought that one night of happiness would have sufficed to illuminate a lifetime. It was a fascinating inventor and I worked for him. I was a... I was a... I was a... Yup? Excuse me. Azionavo the... - Telegraph? - Are you. Are you. Telegraph. Excuse me. Your husband has some hobby? You promised them Coney Island. At least a walk. We will make three walks tomorrow, I promise. Here, why do not you take a picture? It neuralgia, caused by eye strain. A good pair of glasses will suffice. - Oh, no. Will I look awful. - No it is not true. It's impossible. Are you sure? That's all? It has terrible headaches. I'll leave one of laudanum phial until your eyes do not improve. Thanks. Would you mind... Would you mind putting off paying for the visit? My son wants your autograph. Damn, it is rudimentary. How much cost? Not me, I want to say. What we need is here. The Edison current can travel more than a kilometer and runs out. Should build too many of DC motors only to power a city. This country will look like a checkerboard of power plants. But with only one alternating current dynamo, we can increase the tension and get as far as eye can see. We tie up cables on poles. Less copper, more electricity. Is cheaper by 75 percent. The only thing that matters here is the distance. Frank, this belongs to you, what belongs to me. - I would be honored if you get up... - I could not. Do not be ridiculous. - This moment belongs to you. - But you've spent hours... George, it's your idea. You were the architect. Let's go for a ride? Demonstration of alternating current "Al mago di Menlo Park. Since it appears that your brakes have problems, I would be honored to send my car to bring you in Great Barrington, Massachusetts... where I sent with the current success within a kilometer. How did the light bulbs? That deafening silence from the most brilliant minds of America. Use the project of Hiram. That Hiram stole from me! - report it. - We already did. The court upheld its patent. I'm talking about Westinghouse. Find some foothold. Barrington Go and look for yourself. Some of you are slightly annoyed by the fact that there are 15 years of work by stealing from under his nose? Not yet! I built a system, and he goes to buy patents to legally steal what's mine. If the bulbs, then inchiodatelo the dynamo. We can not. Not even using DC power, sir. Use the AC? Mary? Yes, I think we need more tea. Patricia? George Westinghouse? Can I help you? Check in from Thomas Edison. He wants me to buy a generator per kilometer. Then, I read in the Globe that your electricity it would be more economic than that of Edison of 66%. Well, it is only a proposal and is not "my electricity." It is "electricity." I think it makes more sense that the taxpayers of Columbus choose Westinghouse Electric. I do not want to compete. I just want to patent my system. He has the best bulbs. Why not compete? By now I know. Edison I know, I assure you, It does not care to do things right. He just wants to do them. Does not answer. Westinghouse will never have a complete system, - not azionerebbe a sewing machine. - But I can fix it. Instead of converting the currents to make them work with a switch, I would pass the alternating current through two or more energy circuits. It should work on switches with current dynamo. Well, I did. I did what you asked me, but you're making a mistake. Thing? The direct current can work pearls town when... When buildings are close together, but most of your country are empty spaces. Only the high voltage can cover the distance. Do not think long-term. This technology is within your reach. Can I build a good engine. Have you tried it? At the. In my head, it is almost complete. The men claim to have a head full of sonnets and symphonies, but their problem is that they can not write them. - Let me try. - No. I can not start over again! I had orders from Michigan. Journalists are waiting for me. Do that for which you were hired. Therefore, do not you keep your word on pay? - What are you talking about? - You said $ 50,000. - It is not satisfied with my work? - There'll pay $ 50,000. I was joking. Coconut fibers, fishing line, cork, celluloid, flax, platinum, iron, nickel, copper, steel. We've scoured the earth for years and years, trying thousands, ten thousand different combinations. Then, Westinghouse sees what I did and enjoys doing the thief. Every industry has its vultures, you just have to keep them away. So that's how it works. Cartographers entering mistakes in their work to see if someone copies them. I do not have that luxury. I can not invent ways to trick someone. Otherwise we would end all in the dark. Keep in mind all of its violations. Thank you, Mr. Edison. And thanks for this. I mentioned the fact that his system is lethal? If you reach out and touch a doorknob or a rail, become the circuit. In other words? Well, you die. With the current, you can touch anything at any time bare hands. You secure. Works. It bears the name of Edison, so it is more beautiful. Our government wants to convince me to invent a weapon, but I will not use the brain to invent something that hurts people. For these things, you can go to Pittsburgh. Is he saying that Westinghouse wants to hurt people? No, I can not say. But you will. This is what I think of you. It gives a statement to the press today. Contradict his allegations. I do not intend to have anything to do. We have the best system. This is what counts. The Westinghouse Electric Company was founded at a quarter past nine. Hello. George Westinghouse. We had an appointment? North Dakota. New Orleans. Fort Worth. Sioux City. You want the good news or the good news? We waste time to frame him for what's in the bulb, what we should focus on is what's on the other side. The screw coupler. - It's mine. - Exactly. He's suing. Is a huge cause. It is Edison and Morgan. My advice is: know an alternative way to beat gravity? Westinghouse has designed a cap to bypass your screw attack. It's only a matter of time before it runs everywhere. To be honest, I can not wait to apply it in the sawmill. At the moment, we only offer the light. With time, we will devote ourselves to mechanical tools. When? I do not care how much it costs the light. I use the gas. I want to productivity. I do not understand. Edison said that electricity can already be used in factories. Its can. I want to see this needle move. I can not lower the voltage without blowing up everything. Power. You'll even have made some progress. It is not ready. Turn it off! There must be a solution. La Nikola Tesla Electric Light Company. How does it look? - When you can produce arc lamps? - Arc lamps? I thought there occupassimo of incandescent lamps, motors and distribution. Let us think Edison. I'm working on advanced methods to overcome it. To beat Edison? How soon? In a few years. I need a lab, engineers and supplies. Of course, there are the costs. And where did you get the money for the expensive silk? How I spend my earnings is my business. Mr. Tesla, if you need money right away, you can sell your patent. And what would I get? Shares. And, if you have success, you will sell for a fortune. For a fortune. Yes, I know what a figure of speech. We assume two-thirds of the risk. It is a good price for the only thing you can sell. Cerebral congestion? And what does it mean? There is an occlusion, hidden, and is expanding. It will leave at first sight, then it will be his vocabulary to diminish. I can not lose it. I'll do a movable alphabet. I'll give you a dictionary. Gradually will lose mobility. The build an elevator. Mr. Edison, what he needs your wife, can not be constructed by man. What he needs my wife, do you think, It is a simple pair of glasses. The nature takes its course. I... I have to leave for New York tonight. I can not cancel. I'll take care of her while you're away. But... do not you linger. Ohio has selected Westinghouse. - Columbus. Zanesville. - Zanesville? - Lasciategliela. - It's not funny. We do not know if it is a constant until it happens again, and I really hope it does not happen. What is he doing that you're doing wrong? It is building successful machines that will mean the death of human beings. - Where are these dead? - Where are these dead? We change and you have to take responsibility for all the killings. I think the people are not dying because it is not as dangerous as you'd like. All right, beat us on costs. But it's a temporary advantage. Give me time and I will make our economy so that... only the rich will use candles. And until then, entire cities delivered to Westinghouse. I'm not a bank. It is precisely what you are. We could have had this conversation by phone, instead of making me waste my time. When I want to see someone, come here. Face to face. And the way it works. No, here's how it works. I build miracles and you continue to give me those damn money I want. What's up? I did run away to another city? Okay, what have I missed? (I love you) On your bureau. Talk. Will I be able to make you promise to build me a fence? The ground is frozen. He must thaw. On your bureau. Talk. Will I be able to make you promise to build me a fence? No, we take care of my engine, as agreed... Look, do not... We do not want these things. The lamps that you have built are no longer selling. We can not compete with Edison and Westinghouse. So, take my patents and I wish you a great misfortune. - "Your" patents? - Yes. My patents. Can I get you anything, sir? A time machine. If I find anything, I come back to this moment and give it to him. Have you re-read the proposal? I will not use my last resources to illuminate a fair. It is much more than a trade show, sir. A third of this country will come to Chicago to try and see the City of Lights. Shop windows, streetlights, signs that say that the race is over and we won. Why waste the last dollars to travel to show the electricity, when you come all in one place to see it? Because in a year, they will demolish everything. But only after you have seen 30 million people, it is. Westinghouse will present an offer. Nice hat. It seems expensive. I had it from before I started to work for you, Mr. Edison. I do not think you're working for me. - Continue to use my bulbs. - His patents are in order. You want my advice? You say that the current Westinghouse kill people. Therefore... in the absence of evidence, lest they given you? We're doing this because we will have a complete system, It will work and will have the name of Edison. Poor bastard. Well, I myself will be shot down. You do not feel any pain, right? At 3,000 volts will be over before it started. So there's nothing to worry about. But they are journalists, so you might animate them a bit '. Welcome to Menlo Park. Thank you for coming on this cold morning. It's a pleasure to see you again. - My name Southwick Brown. - It is a pleasure. You should further afield '. Gus is connected to the same current that uses Westinghouse, but there is still no word for death by electricity. I asked the writer dictionaries and suggested I "electro-tell" "elettro-cremare" and "dina-morte". But, as Joe Guillotin gave his name to his invention, because remove the about the rightful inventor of death by electricity? I ask you to show respect while Westinghouse this horse. Mr. Edison, Southwick Brown. Commission of Capital Punishment. You have surely heard about the clumsy hangings in the North East. The prisoners suffocated or die violently beheaded. This is an inhuman spectacle. But the death of the horse was so serene, you could say... poetic. The Governor of New York, on my personal recommendation, He would like to consider a deadly device that uses electricity on a living being. It would be an honor for us to entrust the task. - If there's nothing else, it was a pleasure. - I apologize? Killing a human being under the guise of justice, it is absurd. There is a big difference between a horse and a person. God gives us life in a compassionate way. Why refuse the opportunity of being the first man to take it away in the same way? William. I killed my wife. Down with this handle. Maybe you need to do something else. If I'm doing it wrong, you'll never know that I was toying with your phonograph or gramophone, in any way I shall name. What is this thing? Here today at the Mary Tom tomorrow. Or, as you said, today's Tom listens to Mary yesterday. I wonder what else you can do. Mr. Tesla, my son and his friends idiots they told me they do not intend to carry out the arc lamps. It's true? Do not look at him, look at me. They are the primary shareholder. No, I have already finished the project of arc lamps. Finished? You covered one city. Broadway, New Jersey. For God's sake, think big. Philadelphia. You made arc lamps for cities. And your only job. At the. My AC motor. All right? We had an agreement... - No, I have never signed agreements. - You said in this office... Lane, you can wait outside for a second? Sorry. Do not you realize you're about to be fired? At the. Please let me achieve what I have in mind. I will make the largest electricity supplier in the world. More than Edison. They are very close, a few more months. You arrive here as if you came from Neptune, as if you had a great vision of the future... - I do not touch. - Are you just an immigrant. A head full of ideas, looking for funding. You are Edison, Edison is one. That's why he is successful. There are millions like you. Great ideas. But you do not see the real forces that move things and is not the direct or alternating current. It's the money. And it is the only engine that interests me. These patents belong to the Tesla Electric Light Company. This is now the Union Electric and Manufacturing Company and I own all there is in this office. Patents, 'projects, engineers. And all mine. There will be nothing that will be named Tesla. Take your ideas and go back where you came from. It is appropriating a city after another. Cats, dogs, sheep, 11 horses. What else needs to see people? But no one is really dying for alternating current. Excluding your cats, dogs, sheep and 11 horses. - I know I just be your secretary. - Speak and just. Bring the phonograph on the market. You will get the gains. - has yet to be perfected. - Do it, sir. - Bell is robbing you. - The graphophone? He just changed the name. Tell me where I can find a shop to buy yours, and I did not hand over the entire market. Do you have a real deal. Half a million dollars. Lord, take the money. You need it. If Bell has robbed you with the phone, will redo the graphophone. Have you confused about? Would you like Chicago? Okay, I'm ready. A dollar in marble? What do you for? The inventor. It solves problems for idiots. Imagine a dictation without the help of a stenographer. Phonographic books that speak to blind people. Playing music, talking toys. Watches that communicate the hour. Preservation of nearly disappeared languages. The teaching of speech. - Have you cheated. - Yes No. I did not come all this way to lose. Being able to catch the last words of your loved ones. Edison phonograph, the machine that speaks, sings and enchants. A perfect machine, silent. Or you can not or are not the engineer who thought I was. Travel the country to roast cats. George, is playing dirty. You can too. When I was young, my father tried to whip me with a branch. But after the first lash, he broke. In three small pieces. He he remained there, watching that broken branch on the ground. Then, I noticed that there was a leather strap hanging on the wall. So, I pointed and said, "Look, that would be better." He stopped. I know the punches, but I have no patience peri shoddy work. You'll get an engine running next to your location in Chicago, in spite of hell, the flood or the Wizard of Menlo Park. Good night. Good night. We will remember Pope Franklin for his courageous commitment to push us into the future. It was not only an outstanding example of faith in the progress of science... 099 'I try... pain and anger, because what has happened, could have been avoided. Listen, I like you've never heard before. I can state with certainty that if Westinghouse continue its activities... other people will die. My condolences. I know it was more than just an employee. What was his name, Franklin Popes? Pope. Without the What a pity. But I'm here to help. I know that... I would like Edison did silence. Let me join your company. Let me fix this mess. Do you believe that the Westinghouse Electric worth $ 5 million? The value is determined by the highest amount you are willing to pay. But eight hundred men I will lose salary. He will keep his employees. But the five-day working week. It seems to be inclined. What power will you use? What will choose Edison guess. What nonsense. Do you believe me to be absurd. Yes, indeed. We are overloaded, Marguerite. There's no shame in selling. I always tried to become Edison's associate, and now I have the opportunity to do so. We have an engine, we train on a mountain. It's impossible. I thought that the word "impossible" does not exist in your vocabulary. Melt Westinghouse Electric. The revenues will be used to save the other bankrupt companies and it will be the time to repair the errors of Edison. You are not a captain changing course, depending on the sea. We have a broken! We are drowning. All this is costing us a fortune. - It does not care about the money! - A fortune! I was living in your parents' house, while you bussavi at every door. Do you want people to think that you're on the side of what you hate? And you use your last name as a verb? And how you think you can fix that, my dear? I've got you. And avevo Fran k. That's all. I loved that man. It's just a sensible business decision. George. That's all. That's all. Say what you will of George Westinghouse, is a good man. Demise You have entered the federal territory. The point is that... You are mistaken. According to my map... I mourn the passing of my colleague, but bad luck will not win. I noticed that Mr. Edison puts his name on everything because it is scared to come forgotten. If you want to be remembered, it is simple, shoot the President. But if you prefer to leave, as I call it, a legacy, leave the world a better place than you found. Thomas Alva Edison is a charlatan who exploits the fears of ordinary people, because I possess the best system. And since I own the best system, the Westinghouse Electric resist. Good day. Westinghouse took the lead. He will not go. I appreciate your lights, Mr. Edison, but I'm also a client. And if someone knocks on my door with something that I need, and that is better than what I have at the moment, at a lower price, I'd be a fool not to invite him for tea. - It's an ultimatum? - More threatening. If you feel that fear is the best strategy, then you'd better hurry and try harder. Time is up. He built a box with a crank and a lever to preserve his wife's voice. What wrong choice, because she can haunt him forever. I could not stop it even if I wanted. And I will not, because I think it is a fantastic idea. It will be the power to kill the man in Buffalo. We do not know the voltage. Too much and take fire. Too little and it would still be alive. We only need your advice, Mr. Edison. What is human? Where to put the electrodes and, in return, I promise something you know you want. I'll put the name of Westinghouse in plain sight as the official electricity used to kill humans. We might even expose the chair at the Chicago World Fair. The future! My name will never be associated. I have not provided any consultation, Westinghouse will have suggested as the best way for the killings. Guaranteed your assistance? If you do me any questions, I will answer. Bruciate correspondence. Absolutely. These are our seats and our blue wing chair. I've sold three just last week series. This is the classic wooden chair. And these are chairs in oriental style. They are very popular. An austere style. You want four, six, eight, twelve? Only one. Mr Brown, the plant consists of a stationary engine, a Westinghouse alternating current dynamo capable of generating 3,000 volts. A wooden chair with headrest, of the belts and adjustable electrodes. Burn. TAE The voltmeter, I'amperometro, and the control framework They must be located in the execution chamber for monitoring. Burn. TAE The Dynamos hall is connected via electrical signals. Burn. TAE The most efficient machines are manufactured by Westinghouse. Authorize the payment of $ 3,600 for your work. Burn. TAE The only question that might discourage Westinghouse in relation to capital punishment It refers to the fact that the meat might burn to the contact points and the amount of current to be applied without such an occurrence, it is not yet known. Burn. TAE For someone trying to compete at the World Fair, this deadly car is not a good presentation. Yes I know. Edison's just trying to infangarmi, as usual. - Can you prove it? - No. But maybe I could stop him. Are you talking to me? If you want my advice, do not assumetemi. Save money. But I know a man who can say Edison has a bond with the chair of death. No, I mean stop it through legal channels. - You want Edison ports in court? - No. The chair itself. The eighth amendment. So, I should provide a murderess who admitted killing his wife maintaining a ...? It is to show what kind of man is Thomas Edison. Just keep my name out. Your wife knows you are paying for this? It was his idea. What makes electricity not cruel and inhuman? The speed of the current is so high, that the brain is paralyzed instantly. The subject dies before the nerves can communicate I shock. - As I know it is not proven? - I tested it... on a gorilla in the London Zoo. It has links with some electricity company? No, sir. The State calls Thomas Alva Edison. Could you explain the difference between your current and Mr. Westinghouse alternating electricity? The continuous current flows, such as water, through a conduit, and the alternating current flowing in both directions. Water. It does not seem so dangerous. Not until they drowned. Why not use the power Mr. Westinghouse? - I do not like. - Do you believe it is dangerous. Yes, it is. Imagine that you were using the current Mr. Westinghouse, one that will be used on Mr. Kemmler, and imagine using it for five or six minutes. It was in 1500, what would it take before you feel the heat? Well, the temperature may rise to four or five degrees above normal and continue until it would not mummified. And this would not cause great suffering? - No. - How do I know? Because I have personally seen this electricity be used to kill a horse of 400 kilos. - And the horse he felt pain? - If so, he did not say. Mr. Edison, there is great admiration between you and Mr. Westinghouse. Do not disregard Mr. Westinghouse. You two are competing, right? It's not about that. I was asked, as an objective scientist, my opinion on whether death for electricity It is a violation of the eighth amendment and whether it is cruel and inadequate. In my view, the only humane method of execution is the alternating current Westinghouse. Mr. Edison knows that any more than 30 amps... Milliampere. If you have to interrupt me, do it with the correct name. - Thank you, Your Honor. - The honor is mine. Okay, I have everything I need. What do you want, furfantelli? - Mr. Edison. - What's up? Mr. Edison. Look'. I left before I had the opportunity. Mr. Edison, can I get your autograph? Yes sure. William, will you? I must warn you, there's only one thing that beats justice. Money? Fame. Army revolver is a New Model? What a fantastic car. - You know how it works? - You want me to shoot you? I did not mean how to shoot, but how it works. It is a good airplane should look at it. They designed the cylinder, so that the dog is not standing on a chamber empty. Or I could shoot you six times instead of five. I guess so. They both lied in court. But if you want to shoot, this is the last opportunity to do so. Sometimes, you have to act outside of the rules to do the right thing. It would be nice if we did not do it. Really? This does not make you like him. What do we do? I have a bad ear, but it was extraordinary. Priest... Ready? The plant consists of a stationary engine, a Westinghouse alternating current dynamo capable of generating 3,000 volts. A wooden chair with headrest. - Where you have taken? - I will send to the newspapers. Those letters were stolen. You can not make them public. - Why not? - Because it's private correspondence. Mr. Edison, say something against me or against my company, and I'll ask you to tell the truth. It would be the right thing to do. Or do I? - Why do not you burned? - They come from Thomas Edison. I do not understand that this chair It is something to be proud of and for which to be remembered. I do not know how much electricity is necessary. - You said 1,500 volts. - I said: "I think 1,500 volts." But if all the water evaporates in the body, it could catch fire. - We lower the amount. - So, I arrostirete to death. You have to listen to me. What you are doing is wrong. You said that it is inevitable that someone will eventually do so. But the fact that someone else I do, does not mean you have to be you. The State thanks you for your comments and his help. What's up? - What should I tell you? - Say that. You said that a car would not built to kill people. I realize impossible things and rob me. So I am referring again. And I refer, again and again. This is not like the rest. This is everything else. The way of the future will not be made of brick, but copper. Automation, transportation, communication, and the man who controls the current one, controls the future. But you know that Westinghouse is right. Lord, do not really believe that some accident can exclude the applicability of its current. You do not want to miss. I have only amplified what no one else took seriously. No, you are passed over with a 12-ton train. It is he who should realize the brakes, whose fault is it? - Change tonight and so will win. - His current kills people. Just because you said! Can I stop complaining vultures in my garden or build a wall so high that no one will dare to climb over. You're the smartest man I know. Apart from miracles created from nothing, I was impressed by your principles. You have not invented the incandescent lamp, but the people I believe. Welcome to the reality of how things are made. We give all our contribution. This is how the inventions. Salt. The wheat. The heat. The heart. But one man creates the bread. And it is one that combines all this and I makes it so good as to make him turn people and pay expensive to buy it. Mr. Edison, I want your success. Really. But it has to change tonight, or die as PT Barnum rather than as Isaac Newton. Although there may be unknown, her studies demonstrate an understanding of electrical issues unprecedented known to me, with all due respect to the present. Gentlemen and lady, Nikola Tesla. Step to the fundamental question, Yes or no, the alternating current may actuate an engine? Yup. It is possible to construct an alternate system Edison doing what it can do to a third of the cost. In the second drawing of my system, the rotors are located in a more forward position... The second drawing shows the magnetic condition corresponding... One can get a synchronous motor... The induction is always maintained at the maximum activity. Mr. Tesla, you built the engine to test his theories? But they are not theories. No, I have not built. But this would prove his beliefs. But they are not beliefs, and it is completely unnecessary for me operate the engine in my mind or in a store, because I've built in my imagination. - And it's perfect. - Are you serious? Almost always. Hail, sleep George Westinghouse. George Westinghouse. An engine that compresses the air in a reservoir that is brought through a duct to both the train brakes, allowing them to operate simultaneously. - An intelligent design. - Thanks. Nail. I think the room is tilted by two degrees. I appreciate that you have found the time to meet. Going somewhere? - What's this? - They are the Niagara Falls. Since the university, I imagined a great wheel that provided light. Did you know that just came here I worked for Mr. Edison? - No. - Has? Right. I have adjusted two of its dc generators in one night and he called me "a damn good man." So why I not treated as I deserved? I left. I tried to start my business, but I was deceived. Who was I? An immigrant any. So, I took the only job I could find. I dug a ditch. The others laughed at my clothes, but at the end of the day I had $ 2. To whom belonged that ditch? Alla Edison Electric. It was like digging its own grave. If Edison were to do it, so we will leave behind, We will not be able to take it back more. The Fair must alternate. There has to be my engine. I saw how people consider a Chicago landmark, the City of Light. All cities sooner or later will have the light, but also exploit the energy of Niagara, It is to see the future. The waterfalls? - I'm here to talk about Chicago. - Think over Chicago. Energy is as essential as food, water and air. We can not say that only those who have money can eat or breathe. Yes, the Falls illuminate the East Coast. You can get very lucky and I long for a walking stick I saw on the 63th and Madison. But Niagara is proof that, one day, we can separate the energy from the profit. That's how you really wins. - As I know you will not deceive me? - Well... I do not know. But the point is, Mr. Tesla, I need your engine. I may illuminate the Fair, but I can not drive a car. If we come to an agreement today, my business will die right here, in your hotel room. But so it will die also your dream to harness the energy of Niagara. Therefore, we have a deal? Five thousand. Mille. I give you two dollars and 50 cents... for the horse. I'm not a genius, but should be millions. May I invite you to dinner at Delmonico? All right, Mr. Tesla, it's time to go. No, I will not leave your room tilted. It does not pay for more than a month. How much should I pay to keep him here all year? I have to lay off 300 people by the gas. There is no other way. We pay their salaries and we move them to electricity. We can not keep doing this. If we win in Chicago, we will not need it. You have the truth on your side. And whatever happens, you'll know you've played correctly. I stole the letters that connect to the chair Edison death. I delivered newspapers to nail. I know I've disappointed you. What is this? A 25-meter high tower Edison bulbs covered by 16,000 and on top of a three-meter high lighthouse. It is to show the world that we are the winners. Otherwise, how would people know that we won? It is an idol. Is a signature. And you will receive something that no one ever had before by Thomas Edison. - Really? Thing? - My apologies. I admit I spent more than expected, but now, more than ever, it is important to go beyond. Whatever proposal will Westinghouse for the Fair, we have... - You have to offer more. - I must. Devo. Who is Nikola Tesla? He who does? He gave a lecture at Columbia. It is said that Serbia is building a multi-phase motor for Westinghouse. Light and energy. If you can get both, now you can do it too. No one knows what it will take to build a working model... Until this morning, you have given... nine other cities to Westinghouse. Therefore, this is what happens. Edison Electric will build with some emerging company. You're out. And you know why? Ve I will say if you want this moment to be even more unpleasant. You receive the shares, and you will keep your place in the Council. - Who will do the presentation? You? - Good God, no. And me I say now? I was here. I thought meritaste to hear you say in your face. No it is not true. You wanted me just wasting time and get me to sign autographs peri children. - How you gonna call? - And what worries you? Edison Electric. It must be called so. Edison and electricity are synonyms, Morgan. The bulbs... I will connect a failed name fledgling company. Now that leaked the letters, you lose credibility. - So what will? - The name? Yes, the damn name! The contract says only "General Electric", but I will invent something. Even I can be creative. Mr. Insull? Just a minute. He said that will keep your name, just not to overhang complaint or who do not speak negatively to the merger printing. What gave you? - Tell me. - The vice presidency, but I refused. - You should accept. - Why? Alternating current, what is the voltage transmission? It was 230,000. What is it made the filament in a light bulb 12,000 hours? Carbon Japanese Bamboo. - What do you eat for breakfast? - Pie. Of what surprised you? Of course the servants. You are me, but in human form. Look around. Who is missing? Edison General Electric Company, pray. General Electric? - Edison General Electric Company. - Yes. Excuse me. He has 12 years. Mr. Insull? They are members of the Commission. Listen carefully. Concentrate on the quality of light. I do not care what the court says. Westinghouse stole my bulbs. The good news for you is that it has done a terrible job. They are outdoor lamps, and last about two hours. Therefore, at the timing to replace them. He speaks of the superiority of our, as if there was no competition. Use term as "standard", "purest", and "the most beautiful light", and so on. Find out what kind of men they are. There are only two types: those who believe they are practical, but they are dreamers. They are the ones who take risks. The other, smile at you and thank you for I show, but vote with their wallets. Unless Westinghouse did not play all that he has, Morgan will put you in good stead with the lenders. Your only job is to look the dreamers in the eye and promise them the magic. Now tell me everything you remember about the series and parallel circuits without using the words I just said. Even though I'm young, I'm an expert in these matters, at the level of the same Edison. If you had to choose Westinghouse, then... So yes. There is a possibility of endangering the lives of 28 million people. If Westinghouse did even the smallest mistake... unintentionally, of course. A political visit, a wife, a child of seven years It could lean against a lamppost and died instantly. That's all. Electricity Mr. Westinghouse is fatal. Thank you, Mr. Insull. Just to be clear, sir, each electric current over 200 milliamperes can be deadly. Even yours? Mr. Westinghouse, they are members of the Commission Buildings and Grounds: Charles Schwab, Craig Cannon, the mayor Cregier, of course. Certainly. Victor Lawson of the Chicago Daily News, and the Honorable Judge Tree. Io sono Daniel Burnham. We ask you to limit your remarks to an hour. It will not be necessary. - Here's to you. Lord. - Thanks. My proposal. - These are all your figures? - Yes, sir. Independent estimates. Before considering the merits, we would like to start with some general question. Why should we assign to you the contract for the World's Fair? I think because our system works better and... because our system is much cheaper. Mr. Schwab, Mr. Higinbotham, Mr. Cannon, Cregier mayor, Mr. Lawson, judge Tree and Mr. Burnham... thanks for your time and for your consideration. Financially, it is clear. We take the best offer. - Westinghouse is dangerous. - Potentially dangerous. It even included in its documents. The alternating current will be used to kill the man in Buffalo. Both lights come on, right? Westinghouse saves us money, Thomas Edison sells tickets. What I would not give to leaf through it. And the book of the future, right? We need a clear majority, gentlemen. - You do not hai'delle shares of GE? - It is immaterial. No one has ever done what you have done for me. The value of something is not determined by how much you are willing to pay, but the value is given by what it represents. When we vote again, Burnham, you can call the winner tonight. It is true that you are born during a lightning storm? It's true. Agree. Tell me one thing contained in that book. You and Edison you focused on the two ends of the system, dynamos and light bulbs. - But what about what's in between? - The cables? We need it? The problem is that the Remington has many advantages... but unfortunately the gunpowder was wet. What's this? This will be to the eye what the phonograph ears pearls. Dot? Yet. Yet. Any last words? I think to go to a better place. Farewell, William. We live in a higher civilization. From this day. "A terrible sight, much worse than hanging." Westinghouse says: "They would have done better with an ax". "A sizzling noise. A cloud of smoke filled the room with the smell of burnt hair." Well, at least it was a murderess. At least no longer use to kill anyone. Soon everyone will have electric light and no one will remember what happened. I have books so full of ideas to take over 12 lives to achieve them. So, we let him have the Fair and the Falls. Well, for what it's worth... I prefer to have worked for you and for Westinghouse. And why? Well, I would not have had so much fun, right? Have you seen much of the Fair? - A lesson in Muybridge, Little Egypt. - The dancer? - Did you see? - No. It was really... If you have time. You do not believe that the fence is a unique creation? Your neighbor pulls on one and suddenly become two. You also have a fence. There is only one problem. A person on one side of the fence he designed. A person on the one hand built it, a person has paid for it, yet the other person receives a beautiful fence and without paying. I did not steal your ideas. Mr. Edison? Right. Thanks. - I was wondering one thing. - I am sure there are many. I wanted to invite you to dinner... again, but I imagine a moment is like the other. You want to know what was in the light bulb for 13 hours? - I know how it works. - Yeah, I know that I know. Just I wanted to know how it felt. - Such as? - The bulb. When you have learned. What was the feeling at that time? I could not tell you. In the sense... It is impossible to describe the feeling because it was impossible. Years of work. Ten thousand different types of filaments. When the wire entered the bulb, as always, we bet it. And the crackling generator, as the ball began to glow... We were expecting just another failure. Then, something happened. Our best-stranded lasted only ten minutes and this time we were at 20. The people began to murmur. Then, 30, 40 minutes, one hour, two hours. And people began to scream. Remember that we had never gone more than ten minutes. The boys climbed on the walls, tore their hair... Because it was impossible. Seven hours. Eight hours. Nine... We were silent when we got to ten. We were sitting watching the illuminated spirit, drunk with magic, We stared as the... I do not know, as if Baby Jesus sounded Mozart. After 13 hours, the glass broke and I I knew. The world was no longer I myself. I'm working on something new, so new that... people forget the connection between my name and electricity. I wonder if you know what it is. I believe that the solution is... split the cost of the fence. Or not at all to build a fence. Your garden would be twice as large. Is not it, Tom? If nothing else, it was a pleasure. Enjoy the Fair, George. We build monuments to talk about the future, to say that we were here. What we experienced. The real legacy is not that we build up to the sky or carve in stone. The rock will crumble. The paper will disintegrate. And the bones become dust. Only that which does not exist in the physical realm and that can reach both directions, will be eternal. Our ideas. These are what we leave behind. And they are those that can move us forward. Nikola Tesla and George Westinghouse build a power plant from Niagara Falls, paving the way for the distribution of electricity like never before. Unable to make a profit from his genius, Tesla died full of debts, alone, in room 3227 of the New Yorker Hotel. In 1911, the American Institute of Electrical Engineers awarded George Westinghouse the highest honor: The Edison Medal. Before he died, George Westinghouse burned all his personal cards to be recorded only through his actions. After losing the War of the Currents, Edison was granted patents for the kinetoscope and the kinetographer, thus investing a new industry: cinematography. After his death the country turned down the lights for a minute in his honor. The man who enlightened the world
