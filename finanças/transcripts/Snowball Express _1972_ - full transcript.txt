Good morning, Baxter. Nice of you to join us. - Office hours start at 9:00, you know. - I know, Mr. Carruthers. - I missed my bus, and then the taxi... - We would appreciate it... if you would take care of your personal affairs on your own time. What? - Morning. - Mr. Baxter. - Yes. - John Sylvester Baxter? - Yes. - My name is Fowler. I'm with the legal firm of Voorhees, Buckner and Voorhees. Look, if it's about that overdue bill at La France Dry Cleaners... Would you mind telling me your mother's maiden name? Judith Pelton. I can explain that. You see, I didn't pay... I'm afraid I have some bad news for you. You're not gonna sue. The bill is not that much... - Jacob Barnsworth died. - I'm sorry to hear that, but... - Who? - Jacob Nash Barnsworth... your great uncle on your mother's side. - Oh. Oh, yeah. - As far as we can determine... you're the next of kin and therefore heir to the estate. I'm the heir to the... to the Jacob, uh, Nash... Uncle Jacob. Oh, well, uh... exactly what did I, uh... The principal asset is the Grand Imperial Hotel. Grand Imperial... Hotel? It's in Silver Hill, Colorado. It's small, just 25 rooms... but it must be a sound operation. There's a letter here to Voorhees Senior... he handled all of Mr. Barnsworth's affairs... mentioning that the hotel has been taking in over $14,000 a month. Fourt... Every month? Mm-hmm. If you like, Mr. Baxter... our office can handle the transfer of title, recording the deed... and, uh... Mr. Baxter? Huh? Oh! Oh! Uh, please, would you for me... Let me get something straight. You have just told me that I am the, the owner... of the Grand Imperial Hotel in, in, uh... - Silver Hill, Colorado. - Silver Hill, Colorado? Lock, stock and bar. Oh, the keys. And here's a letter from a Mr. Ridgeway up there... expressing interest in the property, if you decide you want to sell out. Sell out? No, I d-don't... You said 14,000 a month. Mm-hmm. We'll start the legal machinery going and keep in touch. Good-bye, Mr. Baxter. - And congratulations. - Yes, congratulations. Everybody. Friends and fellow workers, it is with mixed emotions... that I tell you I am leaving Indemnity and Casualty. After 11 years, however, I couldn't go... without telling you it's been a privilege working with all of you. There are a few, however, I'd like to single out for special recognition. My personal stapler I want to give to that man... who has logged more hours at the water cooler and managed to survive: Jim Cullen, Mr. Water Cooler, himself. Here you go, Jim. The Silver Shears Award goes to George Moll... because he demonstrated exceptional courage at the Christmas party... when he cut off Mr. Carruthers' tie. Keep up the good work, George. Beverly Bockser. Beverly Bockser. The Outstanding Achievement Award, my staple remover... goes to that person who has demonstrated... that she can contribute the most to office morale. Miss Bockser, I think I can say without fear of contradiction... that you have the greatest legs in this office, if not the whole 40th floor. They have been a distraction. They have caused man-hours wasted, but... they've made life here bearable. - What's going on here? - I'm giving my farewell address... - to the troops, Mr. Carruthers. - You're leaving? Yes, Mr. Carruthers, I'm leaving. But I think it's only fitting and proper... that I return my computer cards from whence they came. Unfolded, unspindled... and unmutilated. Ah, ooh, eeh. And zowie! Whoo! You quit. - What's the matter with her? - You quit. Quit? Oh, did I quit. It was beautiful. Your job. You quit your job so we could move where? To Silver Hill, Colorado. Where's Silver Hill, Colorado? It's in Wyoming. Richard, maybe you'd better go to your room. Mom, what has this got to do with sex? Richard! Johnny, you have invested... 11 years with that company. Yes, 11 years. And in that time, I've moved up three rows... from Accounts Receivable to Accounts Payable. Honey, I feel like I've been diggin' myself into a hole... and today somebody threw me a rope. You're just going to give up everything... and drag your family off into the wilderness? Wil... Wh-What... Honey, I am taking over as the owner... and the proprietor of the Grand Imperial Hotel. Does that sound like a wilderness? Susie, this is an opportunity... that comes to few men in their lifetimes. To stand on your own two feet, and to... and to discover your own individuality in a world where we're all becoming... In a world where we're all becoming holes punched in a card. I wanna get out of this smudge pot... get out to where the sky's blue... and, and the air is clear and... Okay. Okay! Run out if you want to, but this family is moving to Silver Hill! Colorado! - I don't see any hotel. - Maybe we're in the wrong part of town. There's only one part of town, and we're almost out of that. Maybe I better ask somebody. - Hi. You folks from New York? - Yeah, that's right. Yeah, I could tell by your license plate. We're looking for the Grand Imperial Hotel. Huh? - The Grand Imperial Hotel. - Never heard of it. Well, this is Silver Hill, isn't it? - Oh, yeah. - And you don't know the Grand Imperial? - No, and I've lived here all my life. - What's goin' on? Oh, Double L, these folks are lookin' for the... What did you call it? - The Grand what? - Imperial. It's a hotel. It might be one of them new places up to Crystal Highlands. No, this is supposed to be in Silver Hill. There's a Silver Hill in Wyoming. See, Dad? This hotel was owned by the late Jacob Barnsworth. Jacob Barnsworth. Crazy Jake? - Why, he's dead. - Well, I know that. If it's Crazy Jake's place you're lookin' for... it's about a mile further out. You just stay on the same road 'til you hit the county road... Turn left along that road 'til you pass Howard Babcock's place. Uh, Babcock. Is there a sign there or something? Oh, it blew off. Then you'll see a couple of Holsteins on the south side of a red barn. Babcock told me he was gettin' some Guernseys. He might've got 'em already. - Uh, red barn. I'll find it. - Just past the red barn... you'll hit a chuckhole; turn left, down that road along the fence line. That'll take you smack dab into the hotel. - Thanks. - If the county's plowed the road. Are you related to Crazy Jake? Are you related to Crazy Jake, Dad? Uh, let's all keep our eyes open for a red barn. Dad? How bad did you break it off with Mr. Carruthers? Well, this is it, all right. Well, let's see what it looks like inside. All right. It's colder inside. Well. It's gonna look a lot better when we get a fire started. See if you can find something to burn, Richard. - What about one of these chairs? - No, I mean firewood. - Look in that box right there. - Okay. - I've gotta get the electricity back on. - Dad... shouldn't we find someplace to stay before it gets dark? - We're gonna stay here. - Overnight? Well, why not? It's a hotel, isn't it? It's just a bat! Richard. Johnny! It's gone. The thing was more scared of us than we were of it. - Then that was one scared bat. - Honey... - they can't hurt you. - But you know, in South America... they kill whole herds of cattle, and they suck their blood at night... Richard! Now, that's enough. Hey, this is really a nice, big kitchen we've got here. Does need a little brightening up. What? There's someone in the oven. Uh, sorry. What was it? - Raccoons. Four of them. - Will you please tell me... how I'm supposed to cook around four raccoons? Don't you worry about it. I'll get rid of them. Like you got rid of Stoutheart when Richard brought him home. We'd better get some things out of the car before it gets dark. - We'll give you a hand. - We can manage. Just see if you can find us someplace to sleep. Okay, son, you... you build a fire... and I'll go upstairs and see if I can find us a place to sleep. - Dad? - Hmm? Bears wouldn't hibernate in a place like this, would they? Bears? No, Richard, bears wouldn't hibernate in a... How would they get in? How'd the bats and the raccoons get in? Start the fire, Richard. You're in this with the rest of us. Come on. Well, come on, Stoutheart. No one's going to carry you. Hey! Come on up here. I want to show you what I found. - A bear? - Oh, no, it's not... It's not very funny, Richard. Now that's funny. I'm glad you think so! Hey, lady, you're beautiful when you're angry. - You wouldn't. - Wouldn't I? You're gonna get it now. Look out there, boy. - Oh! - Gotcha! No way! Come on. Get off. I thought you'd appreciate the warm spot. I'll share yours. Whoo! Mmm. You're like ice. Nothing's permanent. Worried? Mmm. We still have $1,700. It'll stretch a long way. Mmm. We still have $1,700, don't we? The repair to the computer was $130, and the lawyer got $1,000. You mean for a thousand dollars... we got legally stuck with this... clapboard igloo? Yeah, it's all in his letter. Transfer deed, title search and a bunch of other stuff. Is that the kids? Probably the raccoons. If that's a raccoon, that's a big raccoon. Take Stoutheart with you. What I don't need is a 200-pound chicken. Take him. Okay, Snow King. Come on, you're goin' with me. On your feet. Dad! - What was it? - I don't know. It sounds like it's in the kitchen. - Here. You better take this. - Okay. Come on, Stoutheart. This way, Stoutheart. - Aha! - Ahh! Yah! You horse's caboose! Look what you done! It was brand-full almost. Stashed her here last summer, just for a night like this. Now there ain't a sniff left. Of all the jangle-brained... You don't know split beans from coffee comin' up on a person like that! Well, w... y... You're the one that did the scaring. Who are you? Wh-Wh-What are you doing in my hotel? Oh, you the new cock-a-doodle-do around here? W... I-It's my property, yes, if that's what you mean... Who... I'd like to know what some stranger is doing... roaming around the kitchen in the middle of the night. Well, I'm hardly a stranger to this place, mister. Name's Jesse McCord. Jake grubstaked me... and let me winter here for 50 years. We was gonna split down the middle soon as I made my strike. Yeah, well, okay. A lot of things have changed around here now... and if you want to rent a room, I've got plenty of them upstairs. How much you get for a bed? Just for yourself? I'm single and 75. Does that answer your question? - Ten dollars. - Oh. - In advance. - In advance? It makes me real happy to see nice folks like yourselves gettin' this place. It's been like a home to me. Listen at that wind. Oh, Johnny, maybe you'd better drive him into town. Why, bless your heart, ma'am. That's awful sweet of you. But no point goin' into town without no place to stay. No, if I can just find me a hollow tree someplace... I'll make out fine. - Yeah, that's what she is, a waziya. - What's a waziya? Waziya is cold wind that comes sweepin' down off'n the mountains. It can freeze a body solid, just like that. Lost me a partner to a waziya once. He went out to check his mule. Wasn't gone more than 30 seconds. Time I got to him, him and that mule was froze together. Looked like one of them pioneer statues you see. How come you didn't freeze? If you ain't bright as a button. Well, now, I'll tell you why. He had a pint of antifreeze in his radiator. That's about the size of it. Mr. Baxter, sir, if we don't meet again in this world... I just want you to know it's been a honor... just bein' here with you and your wonderful family for this brief spell. Sonny, you be a good little tyke... and help me up with that pack. If I get keeled over too far, 'specially in winter... it's sometimes weeks 'fore I can get upright again. - Oh, Dad! - John! All right, all right. He can stay. But you're gonna work, just like everyone else. Mr. Baxter, sir, I'm no stranger to hard work. I'll be the best bartender you ever had. Bellhop. Should I put him in the corner room, Dad? In the corner... Why not put him in the presidential suite? Fine with me. Always did like that room. Well, we got ourselves a bellhop cheap. Is that a little too much for you there, sonny? - Let me take the bedroll. - No, it's okay. I've found if you put that a little higher up on your back... it's easier to manage. She was takin' in $14,000 a month easy in them days. Soon as the mines played out, of course, the Grand Imperial started downhill. Yes, sir, Jake was just different from most folks. Like he most always would have some bird in here with a busted wing. Or he'd carry hay up to Deer Flats if the snow was too deep. Or took care of the Indians when hard times hit 'em. There are Indians around here? Used to be lots of 'em, but they's mostly died off or moved away. Johnny. - What's wrong? - I was drawing a pail of water... to mop the kitchen floor, and look what came out of the faucet. - A fish? - A fish! A guppy. They's always gettin' sucked out of the pond. - You mean we have fish in our water? - Can't harm you none, ma'am. But they're curious little fellers. That's why Jake put that strainer over the bathtub. Uh, now don't worry about it, honey, because I'll get it fixed. When? And with what? Well, uh, I'm gonna get a loan. - You caught me at a bad time. - I meant a bank loan. A lot of things need fixing: the water heater, the carpeting upstairs... and the, the, the... Is there a bank in town? Bank of Silver Hill. - Owned by a man named Ridgeway. - Ridgeway? Well, now, that's the man that's interested in buying this property. - How much do you intend to borrow? - I don't know. Enough to do it up right. We're gonna run a hotel, let's run a first-class hotel, right? Right. - Right. - Wrong. As a collateral risk, your hotel is all wrong, for my bank, at any rate. Well, uh, I do feel that the hotel has potential, and... Mr. Baxter, have you ever managed a hotel? - No. - Run a restaurant? - Stocked a bar? - Actually, no, but... I shouldn't think it was too difficult. I mean, the beds are all there, and, uh... my wife Sue is a very good cook. Well, now, Mr. Baxter, I would like to help you... but as president of this bank, my first responsibility is to our depositors. Mr. Ridgeway, you, uh, offered to buy the hotel... I have a letter here. That offer still stands. Then I don't understand. Why is it good business for you and not for your bank? Well... I've never told anybody this before... but I've had a dream for some time... of making that old place into a memorial for Jake. - A mem-memorial? - Yes. The Jacob Barnsworth Home For Boys. - How does that sound to you? - Uh, very nice. Oh, fine. I'll be happy to take it off your hands. Uh, Mr. Ridgeway, I think I really should discuss this with my wife... - before I make any final decision. - Oh, of course. It's just that I always feel if we can do something for our fellow man... we should do it while we can, but, uh, don't let me influence you. If you intend to go through with this... I'd be the last person to discourage you. The Jacob Barnsworth Home For Boys? If that fool knew what he had there... he wouldn't be coming in here hat in hand. Well, maybe we'd just be throwing good money after bad. Maybe. But I think we could have made it work. Oh, we'd never get rich, but it would have been a good life. Not only for the kids, but for us. - I kind of like it here. - So do I. Raccoons and all. Hi. You takin' a walk in the snow? Yeah. That's what we're doin'. Oh, I'm Wally Perkins. Remember? Uh, from the gas station? - Oh, yes. How are you? - Oh, okay. Gordon Bowers' pipes froze last night, and I was givin' him a hand... but my blowtorch set his wall on fire. He sure gets mad easy. - Uh, how's the family? - Fine. “Standaroules Plumbarmacy?” Oh, that was Standard Plumbing and Sproule's Pharmacy. See, this used to be two snowmobiles. Well, three countin' the motor. They got totalled in last year's cross-country, - and I collected the pieces. - What's a cross-country? Oh, the Silver Hill Annual Cross-country Snowmobile Race. Folks around here hold it every year. Martin Ridgeway's won it three years in a row, you know. - How's the family? - Oh, fine. Chris is in the kitchen. Why don't you go down and say hello? Oh. Okay. Uh, gee, I hope you don't mind me makin' tracks in your snow. Help yourself. - Wait a minute! - What? - Well, what? - Is all this my snow? Uh, I guess so, if you want it. W... Well... Di... Didn't Jesse say that the property went back into those hills? I didn't pay much attention. Yeah, it goes back as far as you can see. Well, we know this is ours. Look at all this precious, beautiful stuff! You can't get much for snow around here, you know. Whoo-hoo! Johnny, what's going on? Susie, what's the most popular sport in the country right now? - Bowling. - No, no, no. Baseball? - Tennis. - Ping-Pong? Honey, what do the Pfeiffers do every weekend? And Roy and Barbara? - Go skiing. - That's right. And half the time they claim they can't get accommodations. You mean... - turn the hotel into a ski lodge? - Yes! People will come from all over the country to ski a hill like that. But, Johnny, doesn't it cost a fortune to start something like that? Don't worry. Ridgeway will loan me money on this. - Don't bet on it. - Okay, I'll go to another bank! What about Crystal Highlands? They got banks over there, don't they? - Sure, a couple of good ones. - Well, there you are! It can't help but be an instant success, Mr. Wainwright. We could come to your bank next year for more money to expand. Oh, it's very accessible, yes, sir. Right outside Silver Hill. This afternoon. Yes. Yes, sir. Oh... Well, of course I love to ski. Doesn't everybody? Nothing like it, sir. That's fine, Mr. Wainwright. 1:00. I'll be there. He loves the idea. Wants to meet this afternoon. - But, Johnny! - Wally, do you have boots and skis... - and clothes I can borrow? - Oh, sure! You love to ski? A bank is not gonna loan money for a ski lodge... - to a guy that doesn't know anything about skiing. - But... I've got to make him think I know what I'm doing. I made that mistake with Ridgeway. Told him I didn't know anything about running a hotel. I'm not gonna make that same mistake twice. Uh, could you tell me where the ski shop is? - Mr. Wainwright? - Hey! - Watch it, Mac! - Oh, I'm sorry. - Oh! - Whoops. Excuse me, Miss. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to... - Mr. Wainwright? - Mr. Baxter. - I really envy you, Baxter, in this new venture of yours. - You do? Yes, I guess every skier dreams of owning his own slope. But I'd never have the courage... to chuck everything and do it the way you are. Yes, sir, I envy you. Always like to check my bindings before I get on this chair lift, don't you? Oh, always. Did you figure on any ancillary activities at the lodge? Ah, oh, oh, yes. There's bound to be some of that. You know how skiers are. Kind of caught you there, didn't it? Heh-heh-heh. Yeah. Some of the skiers call this run “Nightmare Alley.” But I think you'll enjoy it. You plan on putting in a chair lift like this or starting with a rope tow? Uh, I was thinking about a rope tow. - Uh, generally because it's cheaper. - Good thinking. - Then you can expand later. - Uh-huh, uh-huh. Whoa! What do you... What do you say they call this run? Nightmare Alley. Sounds like fun. - Whoa! - Stop the chair. Uh, uh... - Could you give... - Are you all right, sir? - Here, let me give you a hand. - No, I got it. No, no, no, no. Cr-Crossed up there. Okay, now, good. Well, there she is, Nightmare Alley. - How about a cup of coffee? - We'll be at the bottom in five minutes. Then we can have lunch and discuss your project in depth. Good, good. - Well, you ready? - Oh, I'm ready as I'll ever be. Ow! - What's the matter? - Oh, it's nothing. It's an old football injury that sometimes kind of acts up when I get... Ooh-hoo. Get my knee twisted. Maybe we'd better wait a while before we make the run. Oh, no, no, no. Now don't be silly. I don't want to spoil... spoil your skiing. You go on to the bottom. I'll take it easy, and I'll meet you down there. - You're sure? - Oh, absolutely. I wouldn't have it any other way. Well, all right. I'll see you later, but you be careful. I will. Excuse me. Where do I catch the ski lift down the slo-o-pe? Ahh! You idiot! I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that. I started up there. Look, I'm sorry. I didn't mean... Will you get out of here? Look out! Baxter! You're skiing backwards! - Takes the strain off the old knee. - Look out! See you later. Look out. Look out! Oh, no. Look out! Oh, ma'am, I'm very sorry. I just couldn't help myself. Aren't you a tease. Why did you pick me with so many other pretty girls on the slope? Uh, uh, whoops. You're slipping now. Slipping! No. Help. Uh-oh. Oh! Look out below! Look out! Clear the way! Whoa! - You all right? - Huh? - You all right? - Oh. I'm alive. - I'm alive. - Let me help you. - Okay. Wait a minute. - Easy now. - Easy now. Easy now. - Wait a minute. Get this foot over. Thanks. Oh, thanks a lot. - Oh, boy. - There. You're all right. Hey, that was quite a tumble you took there. - Well, I didn't mind at all. - When you take a spill like that... there's only one thing to do: Get back up on these skis and try it again. - Not too fast, and don't forget... - I don't care if I never... Ho! Ho! Whoa. Whoa! Ho! Look out! Look out! Yell “track” when you wanna pass! Track! Track! Oh! Track! - Whoa! - Track! Track! Track! I need to track! Oh! Track! Oh, no. Ohhhh! Track. “Leaving a wake of destruction from Farewell Gap to Aspen Flats... “where his wild run was finally halted by a tree. “The ski patrol had to recruit volunteers... “to remove John Baxter's victims from the slopes... “and the emergency hospital reported that not since the avalanche... “of 1946 had more accident cases been treated there in one day. “Doctors there could not explain how Baxter survived the blow... “which felled a tree, and an... anthro... pol...” - Anthropologist? - Yeah. “An anthropologist from Harvard... wants to measure the thickness of Baxter's skull.” - Very funny. - We've heard enough of that. It's good publicity anyway. It's bad for loans. - Is Mr. Baxter in? - Are you from Harvard? - Harvard? - Mr. Ridgeway! Oh, there you are, Baxter. Yes. Well, it's nice of you to drop by, Mr. Ridgeway. Well, I, uh, I see you made quite a hit at Crystal Highlands. - Why, yes. - And this must be Mrs. Baxter? - Yes, and this is my son, Richard. - Hi. How do you do? Tell me, what's his name? - Oh, this is Stoutheart. - Well, how are ya, big fella? - Stoutheart! - Richard, I think you better take him to the kitchen. Come on, boy. Dogs are a good judge of character, you know. - He's, uh... - Say, tell me, Baxter... in light of your experience, would you care to reconsider my offer to buy this place? Mr. Ridgeway, I think I'll stay with my plans for a ski lodge. Well, I tell ya, if you're determined to follow your dream... I'd like to help make it come true. - You would? - Sure. How much do you need to open these doors here? - 25,000. - I'll loan you three. Well, that would open one door, partway. I'll take it. That's my trouble. I always let my heart rule my head. Johnny, may I speak to you for a minute? I took the liberty of bringing this form along, just in case. If you'll just sign all those X's, it'll save you... a trip to town. Mr. Baxter, I think these oughta do it. - Oh, fine, Wally. Go to work. - Oh, hi, Mr. Ridgeway. - What are you doing here? - I'm fixing their water heater. I thought you were working for Double L. Oh, it's my day off. - Here you are. - There you are. A check for $3,000. It's a pleasure doing business with you, Mr. Baxter. I know you're going to make this place into something real special. It's been a pleasure to meet you, Mrs. Baxter. My very best to your son. Honey, I think we're in business. I'll tell you what. Let's make a list of everything we're gonna need, okay? - Johnny! - Let's start with $500 for the bar. I'd like to have plenty of everything, in case some weekend we're jammed up. - Jammed up? - In the kitchen. - What do we need in the kitchen? - Johnny! I don't trust that Ridgeway. He wants this place for something... and it's not a home for wayward boys. Now, honey, can't you believe that a successful man like Ridgeway... might want to give somebody a helping hand? Not unless he made a buck, he wouldn't. Well, here's the proof. Here's a check for $3,000. Now where were we? You taking notes? $500 for the bar. We only want to serve the finest food... so let's figure, oh, 500 to start for groceries. I don't recollect it taking on like that before. ...things like that, let's figure 300 at the outside. - Ooh! Dadburn it. - Now try it. Now there's no water at all. I wonder if I've got the inflow where the safety valve's supposed to go. - What should we put for a ski instructor? - They don't come cheap. - Well, I do. - Have you ever been a ski instructor? No, but if I sew a band on my sleeve, who'll know the difference? - Hundred a month and room and board. - It's a deal. He's gonna live here? I don't think it's your inflow or your outflow either. What do you figure we need for the dining room? Glasses, dishes, stuff like that. Couple hundred dollars? - What does that come to? - Uh, $2,800. 2,800. That's perfect. Still leaves us $200 for a rope-tow engine. What's a rope-tow engine? Rope-tow engine is an engine to run the rope tow. Can't have a ski slope without a tow. She's gonna blow! Well, it ain't too bad. Figure 20 bucks for the windows, 175 for a new water heater. Which leaves nothing for a rope-tow engine. Called 'em donkey engines. They could worry a six-ton log out of the woods... so it shouldn't even breathe heavy pullin' a few skiers on a rope. - Do you think it'll still run? - Build you a head and find out. - Yeah, but how you gonna move it to the hotel? - Oh... we can drag it out of here easy enough. - Good, good. - Gettin' it up the hill, though. Now that might be somethin' else. - My Snowcat's broke. - It was workin' two days ago. - Well, it's broke now. - You afraid Ridgeway... wouldn't like it? You know Mr. Ridgeway loaned me the money... - to get started. - That don't mean diddly-squat. Loaned me money on my house three years ago, then laid me off here. Now I'm rentin' from him. Sorry, gents, the Snowcat is broke. Pete Bolles has a D-4 that'd pull it up the hill. - Dad? - Wait a minute, son. What's a D-4? How 'bout it, Mr. Bolles? I'd really like to help you fellas out... but if I was ever to lose this rig on that hill... I'd be out of business for over a month. You understand how it is, don't ya? I'm beginning to. I know what the problem is. Ridgeway owns the pink on it, and Pete's behind in his payments. - Dad! - Not now, Richard. Can't you see I got something on my mind? If you want to sing a few choruses of “I told you so,” feel free. I stepped right into Ridgeway's parlor. Whole thing's goin' down the drain. So let it go. It's not the end of the world. I've never wanted anything so much in my life. Oh! I forgot. From Richard, whose lower lip is out a foot. Mmm, yeah, well. I was a little hard on him today. He kept interrupting and... I was busy. “Dear Dad, if a donkey engine can pull a six-ton log out of the woods... “why can't it pull itself up a hill? Respectfully, your son Richard.” - Works beautifully, doesn't it? - Can I blow it, Dad? Toot her. Attaboy. It's going! Hi, Mom! We're doing it! How 'bout that? Toot the whistle again, Richard. You be careful too, Richard. - Not too fast. - Here we come, Chrissy. - How did you figure this out? Hi, Mom! - We started out... You're gonna make it! - Be careful. - We made it! We made it, Chrissy. - Course we made it. - Dad! - Aren't we going any higher than this? - Course we are! - We're going clear to the top! - All right! The tow rope's goin' clear to the top, but the donkey engine stays here. This is the midway point, you see. Beginning skiers will ski down from here. The advanced will come all the way from the top... and right over there, there's a place for a donkey... for a bunny slope. Anyway, it looks like we're in business. Richard! Stop eating the crackers. Nobody else is here to eat 'em. Well, now, there'll be plenty of skiers around... just as soon as they discover us. There's the 2:50, loaded with big-tippin' skiers... all headed for Crystal Highlands. Can I go help Wally? No. I don't want you near those explosives. Wally knows all about blasting. He knew all about water heaters too. Shouldn't he have that stump out by now? You'll know when she's out. She's out. - Is that the stump? - If it ain't, start lookin' for a new ski instructor. Oh, darn. Oh, boy. The train's stuck. There's been an avalanche. What? The train's stuck. There's been an avalanche. An avalanche? Yeah, it blocked the Crystal Highlands road. It's gonna take 'em some time to dig it out. - I better call Crystal Highlands. - Yeah. First thing to do is to get them skiers in where it's warm. Well, you old claim jumper. I like the way you think. Break out the steaks, Susie, and whip up the cheese fondue. We're about to be bustin' at the seams with skiers. Get up there, boy. This is the most exciting thing that's ever happened to me. I still don't know what could have caused an avalanche. Probably just a freak of nature. - You can say that again, Miss Voight. - You know... you're a real hero, Johnny, the way you rescued us and everything. Is it okay if I call you Johnny? Oh, sure, sure. We're very informal at the Grand Imperial. - Good. And you can call me Naomi. - Uh... Get up there, boy. It's not in the front, but I'm sure you'll like it. - Miss, please. - Jesse! Room 24, please. Miss, the name's Manescue. This is Mrs. Manescue. - This is our son, Sidney. - Which is your valise? This heavy one? Put your bags down here and then register in the bar, please. Make yourselves at home, and if you need anything, call. Dad, Dad. In a hot-buttered rum, what do you heat first, the butter or the rum? - What? - It's not in the bartender's manual, - and I've gotta know... - Just a minute, Chris. You serve, and I'll take over the bar. - Oh, Dad, thank you. - Uh, Wally, look... get the sleigh, go back and get another load of customers. Hurry. They're gonna have that train out pretty soon. - Uh, who had the hot-buttered rums? - Right here. - Double room with a cot! - Aren't there any suites in this hotel? I'm sorry, Mr. Manescue, but it's the best we have. In fact, it's all we have. We're almost filled up. Room 14, please. - I'm sorry, my dear. - Sidney, you stay down here until we get... Uh, the matched luggage. Hey! What about these? Can't leave 'em in the lobby, mister. Better bring 'em with you. - Who's next? - I am! Miss Naomi Voight. Are you related to that nice, cute Johnny? His older sister or something? Or something. Would you like a single? Naturally. - Thank you. - Next. I'd like a single. I'm not married. Daddy! Somebody in there just ordered a Harvey Wallbanger. Is that really a drink, or was he just putting me on? - Harvey Wallbanger? - With a slice of cucumber. - I'm pooped. Is that all of 'em? - Until the next load. Jesse, take over the desk while I start dinner. There's a fish in my drink. Not so loud. Everybody'll want one. What a darling apron. - How'd you like a fat lip? - Oh, yeah? - Yeah! - Well, why don't you try? Uh, Richard, can I ta... Well, he started it. I don't care if my best pants get dirty. I'm not gonna wear any apron! We'll talk about it later. Hi. Hello. - Everybody in bed? - Finally. What do you think about a couple of tennis courts... right over there? Come spring, of course. Perfect. - You tired? - Oh, I'm exhausted. - How 'bout you? - Mmm. Happy exhausted. People seem to like the place, don't they? Yeah. All except the Manescues... and they'd find somethin' wrong with the Taj Mahal. If we can keep them happy for two weeks, we'll be out of the woods. If you get much nicer to Naomi Tight-pants... she might stay through the spring. Just tryin' to be a good host, ma'am. Well, room service is closed for the night. You nut. - Oh! - Who's that? - Well, it's our room. It's Miss Ogelvie. - Oh! Oh! Miss Ogelvie, what happened? I just turned out the lights and got into bed, and he... Now, now, I'll handle this, Miss Ogelvie. What are you doing in this lady's room? You have no business coming in here uninvited. Now you get out of here this minute. I'm sorry, Miss Ogelvie. This will never happen again. How's the steam, Jesse? Fire's down a little. We might could use a couple more chunks. ♪♪ - Hi. - Hi. - How's the steam engine working? - Perfect. That thing could pull the whole town up the hill. - Need some help with that? - No. - Hey, where's Chris? - I let her go skiing. - She's coming back to help me set up for lunch. - Oh. ♪♪ - Hi, Johnny. - Ah, well, hi, Naomi. Oh, it was so cuddly and snuggly in that feather bed... I just didn't want to get up. Yeah, yeah, I know what you mean. Uh, the ski instructor's starting his beginners class. If you'd like to get out there, you could probably get some skiing in. I was hoping you'd give me private lessons, Johnny. - You do ski, don't ya? - Yeah, of course I ski. But I have to relieve Jesse on the tow engine for lunch. Oh. Okay, class, can I have your attention, please? Oh! Oh, ah... Help her up. Help her up. That's gonna happen to you a lot on the slope. Okay. Now, the lesson today will be straight running... or schussing, as it's called. Well, I guess the best way to get the hang of it is just to try it. Who wants to go first? Oh, come on. Come on, Miss Grable, you go first. But, really, perhaps one of the others might... There's nothing to be scared of, Miss Grable. I'll go down with you. Now remember, just relax and flex the knees. - Er, f-flex the kn-knees. - Good. Come on. Come on. Come on. Very good! Very good, Miss Grable. N-Not so fast! Snowplow, Miss G-Grable! - What plow? - Aah! Aah! Aah! Oh, no! Man overboard! Help! Help! We need help! The instructor's gone over the side! - What'd he say? - He said somebody went over the side. Help! - Somebody help! - It's Wally! Wally! Man over the side! - What happened? - Wally! He went over the edge, and he's hanging on a tree! Stop the tow! Ohh! - Hang on, Wally! - I-I'm trying! Oh! Hey! - Track! - Aah! No, no, don't track! - Oh. Oh, boy. - You all right? - Yeah. - Ohh! Oh, no. - Daddy, what are we gonna do? - Well... Run this around that tree over there and bring it to your pa. Tell him I'll lower him down with the donkey engine. - Stay calm! - Daddy, you've got to do something! - Please! Please! - We will, honey. We will, but... H-How about a helicopter? They use helicopters sometimes, don't they? Dad, Jesse says he can let you down on the tow rope. - Good. What? - Hold on, Wally! - Daddy's coming to get you! - Now, wait... I'll hold on! Come on, you can do it! - Go on! - You can do it! Go get him! Let the line... Let some rope out. Let out more rope! Right! Hang on, Wally! More rope! More rope! - You better hurry! - Let it out! - Dad! - Jesse, it's slipping! - Dad! Dad! - Whoa! - Dad! - Unh! I... I got you now, Wally. Get your leg up. I sure hate to put you to all this trouble, Mr. Baxter. - See, I was giving a lesson... - Just shut up, Wally. Now, look. You hang on... and I'm gonna try and turn myself around. - You all right, Dad? - Perfect! - Aah! - Easy! Pu-Pull! Pull him up, Jesse! Aah! Easy! Easy! Easy! Easy! - He's got him! - He's got him! - Come on! - You can make it! - Come on! - Come up here! Oh, Dad, you were great! Don't mention it, Wally. - Oh, ow! - Wally, your arm! You broke it! - No, I'm okay. - We better get you to a doctor. Daddy! - You were great, Mr. Baxter. - Daddy, we better get Wally to a doctor! Oh. Whoa! Whoa! Gol darn your ornery hide! Oh! Aah! Jesse! Jesse! Jesse, stop that thing! You tell me how, and I'll throw in with ya! - Daddy, let go! - He can't! Boy, that's the best knot I ever tied. Get out of the way! Out of the way! Get out of there! See? I told ya. Jesse, stop it! The hotel! I don't know what's wrong, but it's something. The steam whistle's been blowing like crazy. Turn it, Jesse! I don't know if we need an ambulance, but... send one anyway. Good-bye. Aah! - Jesse, where's Johnny? - He's comin'! - Susie! - Johnny! What happened? You wouldn't believe it if I t... Then it went through one side of the hotel and came out the other... made a disaster area out of the dining room. I patched up what I could, but it still gets a little breezy in there. And your guests, how are they enjoying half a hotel? They aren't, are they? As a matter of fact, they've all left, haven't they? Yes, but they all did say they had fun while it lasted. What you're trying to say, in essence, is... that you'll be unable to meet your obligation to the bank this month. Not and do the necessary repairs to the hotel. I wanted to talk to you about an extension, Mr. Ridgeway. - You see... - Baxter, I like you. Well, thank you, Mr. Ridgeway, I... like you too. And because I like you, I'm going to do you a little favor. Rather than let you throw more good money down that rat hole... and force me to all the unpleasantness of getting a foreclosure... I'm going to take that white elephant off your hands... and I'm going to give you, out of my own pocket... not the bank's... I'm going to give you $200. Now, that should see you and that sweet little family of yours... safe back to New York where you belong. What do you say? That's very kind of you, Mr. Ridgeway. I... But I do have until the 15th. Yeah, but that's five days from now. How you gonna get the money by then? I don't know, but I'll get it. Well, George Spellman, come right in. Come right in. Good to see you. Please sit down. Make yourself comfortable. How's that wonderful family of yours? - Richard. - Oh, see ya. - Where's Wally? - I guess he's still at the doctor's. - What'd Mr. Ridgeway say? - No. - Well, what are we gonna do? - We're gonna win the Silver Hill snowmobile race... - that's what we're gonna do. - We are? Yep. Wally's gonna drive, and I'm... - We'll turn that. - Yeah. Do I understand Richard correctly? Th-That you're driving that thing in a race? Susie, we can't have outside drivers. - That's the rules. - It's a rule. Until we arrived here, you'd never seen a snowmobile before. And now you're going to race one at 80 miles an hour? - Oh, no. 40, tops. - Okay, now look. I don't have to come in first. See, there are three prizes. Now, any one of those prizes would see us through 'til next fall. Johnny, you've become so obsessed to hanging on to this place... - that you're not using good sense. - Now, Susie, look... Look, I know what it means to you. And you've done everything you can to make a go of it. We all have. I put up with fish in the water. - I know you have, hon. - And exploding heaters. And steam engines breaking through the house. But I'm not gonna stand here and watch you get yourself killed. - Susie. - Well, I'm giving him a crash program... Now listen to me, Johnny. You go through with this crazy idea of yours and I'm leaving. I can't take any more. A man does what he's gotta do, Mr. Baxter. Just shut up, Wally. Hibler's Department Store has asked me to announce... the annual award for most original paint design and uniform coordination... has been increased to $175. The route this year is the same as last. Down Main Street... It'll hold this time. And it's gonna snow roses any minute now. - Jesse, if you don't want to do this, just say so. - I don't want to do this. All I'm saying is, God never intended man... to travel 80 miles an hour over snow. And if he did, it wasn't in no contraption... put together with spit and baling wire. - That's all I'm saying. - Have you seen Sue and the kids? They're in Denver by now, where I'd be if I had any good sense. That's it. Wally, you wired me to the carburetor. - Get... - Oh. I'm sorry. The Tate Brothers, Dean and Brian! Running good! And driving the Red Devil... for Silver Hill Bank, the winner of the grand prize for the past two years... Martin Ridgeway and Double L Dingman. And in the second row, a late entry not in your program. Driving the Mighty Mongrel... Mighty Mongrel? Yeah, the Mighty Mongrel! Representing the Grand Imperial Hotel... John Baxter and Jesse McCord. Gentlemen, are you ready for the start? This ain't as bad as I thought, Johnny. The kickstand! - Oh. - Push it off! You all right? You're okay. - You all right? - For a 75-year-old papoose... that just got dumped on his head, I'm fine. Go get 'em! We'll never catch up! We'll catch up! Lean! In the turns, lean the way I lean! I'm havin' enough trouble just hangin' on! Right! Look out! - Watch where you're goin'! - I can't see where we're going! That does it. We're travelin' now, Jess! How'd you get ahead of me? Never mind. Tell me later. Get on. Johnny, I wouldn't get on a three-week toot with you... if you paid for it and throwed in the Dolly sisters! Now, listen, Jesse. We can't win unless we finish with two riders. Get on this thing! Not on your life! You let me off this thing! We're catching up! Hey! How'd you get up here? - I flew up here, how do you think? - Well, I can't see! - Get back to where you belong! - Fine with me. How do I do that? Jesse, hang on. Don't hold on to the steering! Get back and sit down! Look out, Johnny! If we come out of this alive, and I don't figure to... - will you do me a favor? - What? Fire me! Slow 'er down, Johnny. I can't! The throttle's stuck! It's them! They're gainin' on us! Give it the gas! Come on! - They're comin'! - Aw, shut up! We're comin' into Split Rock Pass! You'll never get by 'em, Johnny! This road's got more crooks than a miners' convention! We'll get by 'em! Ridgeway, you horse's caboose! - Look out, Johnny! - Get it over! Whoa! Johnny? I'm here... but I'm not sure where here is. We dead? I didn't want to be the first to mention it. Johnny, I hate to add to your troubles, but it's gettin' hotter. It sure is. Must be that go-round I had with the widow Corzine. But, heck, that was 20 years ago, and she started it. I think we're moving. Where's that light switch? We're on a mine cart! Must be the old Hard Luck Mine. They dug clean through the mountain. Never did find a vein. You mean this... this tunnel goes clear through the mountain? Yep, and all they got was calluses. Well, we'll save miles. We'll get a big jump on everybody! You can say that agaaaain! We've got a busted ski! We'll never make her, Johnny! That's the good ski that's busted... and the steering's got the wobblies! It's just two miles, Jesse! Look! How'd they get up there? I don't know how they got there! There's the town! Well, when they come, they come like that. Folks, we just had a report from the Perkins farm. The leader just passed. He'll be turning in at the head of the street any second now... so we're going to have to clear the straightaway, folks. Clear the straightaway. Here he comes! It's the Mighty Mongrel! Steering's gone! Folks, we've just had another report from the Perkins farm. Martin Ridgeway has just passed, and he's headed this way full bore! Ridgeway's just comin' into town! The Mighty Mongrel has suffered a second broken ski. It looks like three in a row for Martin Ridgeway. - Oh, yeah? Come on, let's turn this thing around. - What? We've gone this far on one ski. We can go the rest of the way on no skis. All right, let's point it towards the line. Here he comes! It's Martin Ridgeway! Come on! Ridgeway hit a snowbank! - Of all the stupid things I've ever seen! - I tried to lean left! Why didn't you lean left when you're supposed to? Sit to the rear, Jesse. Lean back and keep the nose up! - Lean, Jesse! - Here comes Ridgeway! Give her the gun! - We haven't crossed the finish line! - I know it! And the winner is Martin Ridgeway! Stop this thing! It's all over! I can't stop it! It won't turn off! Giddap! Come on. I'm glad I married you. Giddap! And this is the quit claim deed. And if you'll just sign all four copies. Oh, now, Baxter, don't take it so hard. There are many businesses you could do well in. Have you thought of insurance? A lot. Look, uh, Mr. Ridgeway, isn't there some way I could get an extension on... I feel as bad about this as you, Baxter. But look at it this way: You're not losing a lodge. - you're providing a home for wayward boys. - Boys' home, my foot. - Miss Wigginton. - I don't care if you do fire me. I can get a dollar an hour in Denver, twice what you pay me. He wants this place because there are 3,000 acres of Douglas fir... - that goes with it. - There is? Jacob Barnsworth deeded it to the Ute Indians up in these hills. It was to be theirs... - as long as they occupied it. - They didn't have to prove up or nothin'. Wasn't like when he give the 200 acres for the town of Silver Hill. That was on condition the town fathers... kicked in with a library, a church and two hospitals: - one for folks and one for dumb animals. - Anyway, the Utes... have all left or died off, so the timberland... automatically reverts to the Jacob Barnsworth estate, and that's you, Mr. Baxter. So that's why you wanted this place. You're gonna cut down those woods back of town? Let's stick to facts. You cannot meet the payment, and it's due today. - Dad? - Not now, Richard. I know it's due today, but if I could just have a I... There are no buts about it. If you refuse to sign the quit claim... you force me to start foreclosure proceedings tomorrow morning. - But, Dad! - I told you once, Richard. Did you want to say something, young man? Well, I didn't see any library in town. How come Silver Hill don't revert back to you? - Doesn't revert. - Well, how come? Yeah, how come? I mean, why don't it revert back to me? It seems like the same law would apply. - Oh, that's ridiculous. - There's nothing ridiculous about it. If the deed restrictions have been violated... there's an automatic reversion to the grantor, or his heirs. You may just own the whole town of Silver Hill, Mr. Baxter... including his bank. Ha, ha, ha. Well, now, Johnny... I see no reason why we can't work this out. You know, a ski lodge may be the best thing that ever happened to Silver Hill. Uh, what would you need to put this place back into shape? - Repairs? New furniture? - First-class double chair lift. Ahh, that's a good idea. Well, why don't we have lunch tomorrow, and we can talk it over? Could I trouble you for a glass of water and an aspirin? Oh, sure, Mr. Ridgeway. Come with me. I beg your pardon. Do we own the whole town of Silver Hill, Dad? I don't think Mr. Ridgeway wants to find out. Good work, son. Mrs. Baxter? I think we've got ourselves a real ski lodge. How'd you like to ski down our mountain? I'd follow you anywhere, Mr. Baxter. Ski down our mountain? - Good. Good. - Oh! Oh! - Very good. - Oh, Johnny. - I'll never get the hang of it. - Sure you will, Susie. Look at the kids. - Looks good! - You two are doin' fine. Let's see you turn! That a way to go, Richard. - Oh, I don't know. - Susie. You may not believe this, but I was no better than you are when I first started. - Yeah, it's really safe. - And you know me, Mom. You can't live on a ski slope and not know how to ski. I guarantee you I'll have you skiing to the bottom of this hill in no time. Even Stoutheart and Jesse are getting into the spirit of things. Come here, Stoutheart! Come here, boy! Come on! Come on! Attaboy! Come on. Come on. Come on here, boy. Attaboy, Stout. Stout...heaaaarr... - Dad! - Johnny! Oh, Johnny! Aaahh! Oh! - Johnny! - Chris! - Mom! Dad! - Mr. Baxter, fall down! Are you all right, Johnny? I'm fine. See, I told you I'd get you to the bottom of the hill in no time.
