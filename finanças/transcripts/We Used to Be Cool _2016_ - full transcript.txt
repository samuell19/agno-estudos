Shadows. Weren't you rosy-cheeked? Weren't you happy? Despite the little burdens Fighting with other children With Daddy, with Mummy Where did it start and when? What annoyed you? Just what ruined you this way? Oh, how beautiful. Thank you. - I'm amazing. You're amazing. You're so great. But I'm great, too. Dude, now I need fishing equipment, too. You have walked 270 steps today. Your resting heart rate fs 68. Listen to this. It costs 140 euros and might be dull, but it's my best purchase in years. You lose precious time on earth looking for a parking spot. Exactly. My solution is a taxi. - My solution is a bike. I sold mine online. A bike is nothing but a status symbol. Especially with a basket for the organic groceries. It's just mainstream crap. - Exactly. No more dope for him. He's talking too much again. It's better if I smoke and talk. - Yeah, sure. Anyone noticed anything about me? You've got four ears. - You've lost weight. How? Paleo? She's puking every morning instead of eating breakfast. Why? No. Really? That's why you haven't been drinking lately. I win. Was it some kind of competition? - Give me this one. I've never won anything. - Except in ping-pong. Are you serious? Are you? I think this is when we congratulate them. I knew you were hiding something from me. I'm so happy. Our first baby! - You're having a child? Yes, you kidder, she's having a baby. - Wow! Congratulations. Thank you. - So, let's toast to it. I didn't know, you wanted to have one. Have you been trying for long? - Will you make me one, too? I'm not ready yet. But I want what Stella has. Congrats anyway. It's great. - Yes, it's super. Let's tag along if they're all having one. How old are you? Four? Firstly, I never tag along and secondly, I'm not ready. And when will you be ready? - But you could make Mignon one. Then they'll get off our backs, Luis. Okay. But in my bed. I find other people's beds disgusting. Sure. We don't have to discuss it now, but... But I really don’t want one. - I see. Of course I want children with you. With who else? But... You have to accept my pace. I'm not mature enough yet. You're over-mature. The guys at the office call you “old timer". No way. Is that true? - Yes. But please yourself: I'm French and hot. Someone else will make me a baby. I don't think Chris wants to. - Smoking pot ruins your sperms. I think I'm happy. I'm pregnant. How come? - I let him do it once without a condom. I gave him one chance. How could I know that the petty loser was so fucking virile? Do you love him at all? I have to be with someone. No, you don't. I don't have time to pick someone up every time I'm horny. Congratulations. - What for? The hormones are making you a drama queen. I'm dizzy. We, of all people! Did you ever think I'd say that? I'm happy for you. We'll be the coolest mothers. I won't lift a finger. It was Chris" idea, he can do everything. Well, you'll have to breastfeed. - Why? He can have my belly as long as he needs it, but that's it. You said "he". - I did. It's going to be a hoy. And his name will be Elvis. Hi, Mignon. But don't you have enough fonts? - Yes, but... I want you to come inside me in 15 minutes. I'm talking to Chris, honey. - You talk to him every day. I'm ovulating now. You smell of red wine... - Now Ines is pregnant as well. What did she say? She wants me in bed right now. No time for that. We're going to the bathroom. lake me a baby. - Did you just say Ines was pregnant? I'm all yours. I'm not sure if { got it right. You'll underestimate the power of hormones if you've never experienced the whole nine yards. They shoot through you like falling stars, making you think the whole world is singing and smells good, that you can defeat death. And even if what you're experiencing is the most trivial thing in the world, you're stiff convinced you're having the most unique, extreme experience ever. And what's more important, you just know that you'll do everything so much better and so different to everyone else before you. And that you'll amaze the world with all your coolness and love, and the impeccability of your tissue. And you've heard that there's no way back. And you don't have the slightest idea yet what that means. WE USED TO BE COOL Wait a second. I’ll just check if you... A bit more in this direction. Okay. And action. I like it. You could also make a series featuring us. This is for the big screen. - Oh, okay. Well, I don't want to be filmed while changing nappies. Why not? It's not meant to be a promo film about super daddies. It's more about reflecting on being parents. In the form of interviews over a long period of time. Maybe until the kids are in school. I'm with you 100%. It doesn't always have to be about world politics. I'm also with you 100%, but I just wonder who'll watch it. Well, other parents, for example. Do you think they want to listen to us saying how wonderful our kids are? If you're sincere, they'll want to hear you. Exactly. That's what this is about. Because we know each other we can be totally frank and say what we really feel. I need to take a shit. Nice start. - Sure. It feels like we're playing truth or dare. You don't have to join in. - I do. You need someone good-looking. All right then... First question: Who'll go on parental leave? Excuse me? Hold on. Markus... - Fantastic. Do you ever worry that we'll become conventional? What do you mean? - I mean like... Conventional, as in: father, mother and child. Why should we? That we'll lose ourselves. Why? We're the perfect example that there's another way. And that, as a man, there's no need to be afraid of it. Even if my father can't understand why you don't do the ironing... Well, I don't either. We don't iron. But he doesn't understand why I do the cooking. That's not the point. It's not about my father. What I'm trying to say is: I love cooking for you. You have the money. I have curry. And, well... Everything's fine. Can I try that? Can I have a slice? Are you all right? I'm the feminist in our relationship. And I think it's great that you earn more money. I think... No? But it's authentic, isn't it? Smoking weed and babies don't go well together. I think you worry too much. You don't worry enough. That's what you love about me. Is it unpleasant? Wy dears, before we start our wave dance, I want you to feel your feet on the ground. And to breathe consciously while you do that. Feel free to open your mouths. Very good. And now turn to the right. Don't forget about your hips while you're breathing more consciously. Right. A bit more. lake smooth movements. Life... It's like surfing on a wave that never subsides. Give her some breeze. Give her some breeze. A breeze... You can surf this wave together. Well, it's a shame your partners are late. Very nice. Perfect. Your wave is getting more intense now. Just let yourselves go. Intense, and yet tender. Be tender, that's very important. And now concentrate on your pelvic base. Feel your pelvic base. As if your labia we’re trying to pull a tissue out of this hox. Can I help you? Look who's here. Still taking the stairs? You shouldn't do that, honey. The lift wasn't there and I didn't want to wait. How was your holiday? - Oh, fantastic. Thanks for feeding the cat. Say, will Markus be there when you give birth? Yes. - Don't let him, honey. It ruin your sex life. Okay. - Right? And here is our delivery room number 3: Earth. Here we use aromatherapy and meditation music. It's like at a spa. Will get a massage, too? - Well... Our treats are reserved for the mummies. Can I post a picture of this? - Well, yes. Sure. Can I ask you something? Does it really feel like you're trying to poop out a brick? I’ll give you the epidural brochure. The thing about the brick wasn't really... I mean... Well, never mind. But it was a hit strange. But it's a nice place, right? Well, I've thought about it a lot and... An epidural... Maybe I’ll do it. Maybe I’ll have an injection. You take tranquilisers when you go to the hairdresser. I take lavender oil drops. That's hardly the same. Or maybe I’ll have a Caesarean. Everyone does that now. It's totally normal. - Now you're being hysterical. It's a routine procedure. A tiny cut and it's over already. Smaller than your penis. Thank you very much. You're not listening. I didn't say anything had about your penis. I... How can you be so self-centred? I'm self-centred? This isn't about my penis! You're not listening to me. - Yes, lam, But this is about our child, made with love and growing peacefully. Everything's chilled and natural and suddenly you're talking about epidurals and scalpels! You don't even know how bad those drugs are! You know what? I think drugs are great! You and your fucking organic crap! - Right. Okay, sure. All right. Can we... If it's so great, then let's do this: Let's at least try to give birth the natural way. Please, let's try it. For you and for... I'm the one who's giving birth. All right. I've ordered two books... - Excuse me. .. on natural birth. - Please stop the car right now. What? - I have to get out. But it... I... It's just because you're hysterical... If I were you... - Can you please just shut up? My girlfriend has the money. I’ll be back in a second. Great. Stella. Stella. Stella... Do you know what you sound like? You talk about my body like it was a basis for decision-making in a direct democracy. Well, it's not. It's my body. And I have a say, too. Markus... You used to say such nice things about me. And about my body. And you never compared my penis to surgical procedures before. Okay... I love you, Stella. We'll do it the way you want. Okay? Can you give me 12 euros, please? It always hurts when something changes. Whenever... ... you gain something, you lose something else. Otherwise your life would he overcrowded. That's... ... logical. That's cleansing. Quiet, please. 47/2, first take. Camera's rolling. - Quiet. You can't make tampon adverts and be taken seriously as a director of political documentaries. You can't be fat and beautiful at the same time. You can't always strive for the best and get the best, without becoming totally ordinary. It's cute, but mine has really long legs. I saw them on the ultrasound. You can't compete with someone without setting a finish fine. I think something's wrong with me. I don't give a shit about all this. I just want my old life back. Don't get down now. Apparently losing the ego is an important process and only hurts at the beginning. I'm having an epiphany. my own shop. A boutique for babies. Fair trade, but stylish. Is it a contraction? No, definitely not. I've felt like this all day. Oh, I'm so jealous! La belle, you're becoming a mother! You can't pretend to share something forever, if you feel absolutely alone. You're doing great. Now push as hard as you can. That's great. Very good. And one more time, come on. One more time. One more time. Perfect. Great. One more time. Perfect. Great. Don't push now. Yes, breathe. Super. Don't hold it back. Let go. And everything beautiful also hurts somehow. Because you can't frame it to keep it. You're always waiting for something. And everything is always over too soon. I don't love you. You just can't have everything. Okay. Changes. Yes, I wanted a child. Absolutely. Then you walk through a door and it snaps shut behind you, and there's no way back. Who builds these fucking things? We should've got a Bugaboo like everyone else. 1,000 fucking euros for a buggy? And I always carry Elvis in her baby sling anyway. Baby slings are not sexy. - Oh, grow up, will you? For example, for my birthday, I wanted the new book by Houellebecq and he gave me "Your Competent Child" by Jesper Juul. But never mind. She's not against vaccination on principle, she's just negligent. And if they had Aptamil for school children, she wouldn't buy anything else until 2031. You shouldn’t have a baby with a woman like that. Well, he's morally superior to me, but not in any other way. Just because someone has ovaries doesn't qualify them to be a mother. That's 5,744.80 for my investment and expenses. The tools aren't included. I’ll take them with me. But the screws are included. - Of course, they're in the wall. Prick! You left me! Have you got a fag for me? - We quit smoking. Doing everything right, are you? Tasty. Don't you worry about what they put in that convenience food? Rice. That's about it. - I'll tell you something. First, they rip off the small Chinese rice farmers. They add chemicals to stop the rice going off. Then they send it to Eastern Europe where it's moulded into discs. And then, old trucks, with very high CO2 emission levels, bring the crap to organic shops for spoiled Westerners. That's how it is. I read it in The Guardian. We're getting off at the next stop. I need a gin and tonic. I'm sure they also have iced matcha. Tea latte smoothie with spinach... - Chia... Goji... berries... A child puts everything into the right perspective. The morning circle is round The morning circle is beautiful And so we'll all walk out Into the sunshine Or info the rain ‘Cause we're reckless - Reckless... We don't need a break We'll just stop for a small snack Talking of snacks, I'd just like to say... I'm not really comfortable with the white flour. Of course we don't use white flour. We teach the little ones autonomy by letting them mix their own muesli. Do you want to add something, Aimée's daddy? No. I think it's great. Well, seeing muesli as healthy is a bit old-fashioned, isn't it? I'd like to know exactly what's in it. - Okay. Yes... - Well... We have spelt flakes, coconut flakes, oat flakes, nuts, raisins... Hang on. Raisins? Yes, they're dried grapes. - Raisins are poison. Pure poison. Hardly. It's sugar. - Not really. Why not just give them Nutella? - I have to disagree with you there. Raisins are great. Saying everything's great all the time doesn't really help. Well, that's how I am. - That's really how he is. Yeah. Cool. Who's your tattoo artist? - Sam. Fine. We can also leave out the raisins. Yes... - No! Stop! Sorry. Actually, I don't care. Sorry. - How can you not care? Folks, you've got serious problems. - I'm fine either way. Well, then... - How can you be fine with both? You're either for raisins or you're against raisins. So we're all agreed: we'll leave out the raisins. Yes. We can use something else instead of raisins. Like what? - Like dried apricots or goji berries. It's the same. Fruit contain fructose. - How about gummi bears? My God, are you serious? I never thought I'd see you here. Elvis is with Chris. It seems like Elvis is always with Chris. True. I think... - I don't care. Bye. Bye. - See you. I’ll get going then. Do you think that everything's different now? I think you're just imagining it. Bye. Lola, don't climb up there. Wait for me. Markus, we're going to start. Daddy's coming. Honey, are you so hungry? Great basmati, right? You have to embrace the illusion that there are no illusions anymore. Your time is over. You only exist through another person. Careful, Elvis. - Hi, darling. What's that on your head? She said her ears hurt and the best remedy for that are onions. What have they done to you? We don't need that. Let's see. Do you want to eat with us? - Have you got a beer? Wine. She needs a nappy. And so does she. Aimée never wears nappies. Since when? - Since always. But then you have loads of laundry. That's not ecologically friendly either. You were so desperate to have a baby. How can you be so uninformed and ignorant? There's a lot of us, Chris. We're part of a movement. Nothing yummy in here. Just organic crap. Thanks. I’ll put you down, honey. All right. They're not wearing nappies. No big deal. I don't want to discuss our children's excretion. Why not? Just because you're a man? Us mothers talk about it all the time. Ines doesn't. - Of course she does. Ines talks to you about Elvis' shit? All right. She doesn't. And that means she's a bad mother? Have you all lost it? - No. Just you, Chris. She dumped me. I stayed with her even after she told me she didn’t love me. You don't understand her. Who... I was the one who got up every night. I took Elvis into the office. I made her milk ten times a day. I taught Ines abdomen exercises 50 she could wear size 8 again. She's so busy fighting nature she can't see what she's doing to you two. But you should see it. Your child is still alive, but she's absolutely lost. You just crossed every social boundary there is. I'm just honest. I know you Austrians have trouble with that. Speaking of honesty: In reality, you're probably from some Austrian province. You were an au pair in Paris and think the accent's sexy. It was. Pre-baby. You used to be a cool, hot, witty woman. Now you're an annoying, organic-lifestyle fascist with a fat arse and milk stains on your shirt. An Austrian provincial dialect would suit you. How nice. We have a guest. And you probably couldn’t handle her choosing me. But you can be happy now. She left me with our waif of a child. And you live with a sexy provincial woman in your fair-trade fairyland. Honey, let's go. Aren't you eating with us? - Up yours! You reek of onions, honey. Yes. You never told me you used to be with Ines. She's my friend. And I didn't know you were from the provinces. You should know one thing about a French woman: she's never second choice. What? Your child starts from scratch. And so do you. And what's even crazier is that your world is turned upside down. Lola, we share our toys, okay? "We" are really nice, too. You can talk to us directly, too. Oh God, I sound like Madame. Right now, I'm totally up for Mignon bashing. Right now you're against everyone, right? No. If at all, it's the other way round. True. Do you ever feel sorry for yourself? Yes, sometimes. Is that your guitar? Yes. - Will you play it for me? Okay. - Yes? Yes. - Cool. But I still need this. Did you just write the song? Yes. Kind of. But it's... It's not really serious. And it's not... Never mind. I talk too much. Before you have kids, you talk about relationships all the time. When you have kids, that stops altogether. Hi. It's neither local nor organic. I didn't have time. Hi, Ines. - You can't imagine how much I miss this. Hito you, too. We had a deal never to be like those bloody mums who have no time for their friends. I don’t remember that. - Never mind. We'll work everything out now. Sure. You poor, unhappy girl. Quick, give me a drink, please. - You chose the wrong guy. I benefited from it. But still, it breaks my heart, chérie. No drink for me. I'm leaving now. No way. You said she wanted to talk, not to punish me. But you two didn’t fuck, did you? No. - You're being obtrusive, honey. You make it sound like something bad. Very good. Hi, Ines. - Hi. Fancy a smoke? It's great stuff. - Sure. Hit me with it. Are you serious? Can we eat first? The children are hungry, and so am I. All right. Darling, the sausages will be ready in one minute. Never say “darling” to her. Did you mean me? I said "darling" to Lola. Sorry. But why shouldn't I say "darling"? Shall I start with the gender issue or by explaining authentic parenting? Who's that? - I've invited someone else. I’ll take strawberry. Hi, guys. Well, almost. - Hi. But why? - Because I thought it was a good idea. What a coincidence. I just finished cooking. Cool. As it happens, I brought some beers. Great. - And dessert for the kids. What a happy coincidence. Like the yin... to your wok. I think cooking is much better than meditating. Have you ever cooked? - Baby food. She's asleep. I almost fell asleep as well. I'm getting a beer. Want one? He won't move out of the car. He won't do it. Because he likes suffering. I think it makes him feel younger. I don't care. It's ridiculous. I mean, you live on your own in 130 square metres and the father of your child showers in his office? Now take it easy, you experts. We just want to help. Nice of you to try, but it's still our business, isn't it? Please, carry on talking. Relationships are hard work. Every single day. Come on... Obviously the romance fades a bit when there's a demanding little person and you can't have a blow job on the couch in the middle of the day. Excuse me? I never gave you a blow job on the couch in the middle of the day. You also never gave me a blow job on a couch in the middle of the day. Yes, I did. At your parents' place. All right. Just the once. - Oh my God. Well, thanks so much for the delicious curry. And the great counselling. - You know what I mean. I’ll pick Elvis up tomorrow at three. - Okay. It's modern now to be friends with your ex. “Conscious uncoupling”. But she's got no manners. You're still living in your car because you hope to move hack in, right? It'd be a bit gaga otherwise. - What do you want from me? I mean... Mignon, your daughter just took a shit over there. I’ll get it. It's the new trend. - And when do you plan to get it? Ina second. Chill out. But it reeks, Mignon. It's breast milk poop. There's nothing purer. I’ll put a nappy on your daughter. - No you won't. That's rape. - It's hygiene. Here we go. Wait, your toe... Are you deranged? Very good. Let her go. - No. Aimée, you want to wear a nappy? Great, darling. Shit. I should probably go after her, right? - Come on, what can you... I mean... It's getting out of hand. Well, the cake is lactose-free, in case... Cool. Of course she overdoes it sometimes, but... She has high standards. She wants to be the best and have the best. This is so great. What's the price? It's 169. It's made of organic cotton and the buttons are real hor. Beautiful, right? - Lovely. I’ll look around a bit. And look, it's a reversible jacket. It's a bit expensive, but so cool. You basically get two jackets. Thanks. But, to be honest, the prices... It'll only fit Lotta for three months. Sure. It's your choice if you prefer to go to C&A. Where have you been? I’ll come by this afternoon and help you clean up. You don't have to. - Just accept help for once. Taxi? - C02 footstep. Did you order a taxi or not? It's okay to do the wrong thing for once. - I do the wrong thing all the time. You don't have to be perfect. You're already perfect. Aimée woke up ten minutes ago. Let Luis take care of her. Let's go for breakfast. Like in the old days. He'll give her the wrong flakes. He's a grown man. Let him do it. Everything's going smoothly. As smooth as whipped ice cream. Where did it start and when? What annoyed you? Just what ruined you this way? Look who's here. Didn't they listen Or wouldn't they believe? Or were they too dumb to understand What you were talking about Did they want to rob the truth And lock you in In their cactus garden? Couldn't they wait a bit longer? Just what... Just what ruined you this way? Where did it start? What happened? Haven't you ever rebelled against anything? Can't you run fast enough? Or what else went wrong? Is the wound deep in your soul? Or can’t you remember anymore? Aren’t you still God-only-knows-how privileged? Just what ruined you this way? Just what ruined you this way? Darling, what have you done? Weren't you rosy-cheeked? Weren't you happy? Just what ruined you this way? Didn't they listen Or wouldn't they believe? Just what ruined you this way? And the cactus garden... Couldn't they wait a bit longer? Just what ruined you this way? Where did it start? What happened? I'm on cooking duty on Friday. Lactose-free. Can you take over? All the plebs are riding single-speed bikes now. That's true. Do you want to swap? I've got red beet and pomegranate. I... I'd rather swap this for a gin and tonic. Okay. Does Lola really eat these four-euro Styrofoam crackers? What's this between us? - I don't know. You tell me. I don't know. I really like Markus. And I like Ines even more. Ines doesn't care. But this is horrible. So why did you reply to my text message? I don't find you horrible. We can't discuss whether we want to start an affair in a supermarket. Let's go for a gin and tonic. Sit down and you'll get something to eat as well. Markus cooked it for you. It's a chickpea stew. With spinach, tomatoes and... Parmesan cheese. It's Pecorino. - Oh, excuse me. Pecorino... Why are those people sitting outside? Call me when you arrive. Sure. I mean, if I don't forget. You know how stressful these meetings are and... I think the battery's almost empty. I’ll be back tomorrow morning anyway. Probably around eight. Thanks. Tell me, honestly... Do you really like what I cook? Is that a serious question? - Do you think it's... ... Really good? Yes. I've always liked your cooking. To me, you're the best cook in the world. Thank you. - You're welcome. Well, then... Ciao. Bye. See you tomorrow. Have a good time. - Yes, you too. Thanks. Ciao. Now you need me, right? - I don't need you. But she insisted on sleeping over with Aimée. Do you want to go in? Off you go. Call me if anything happens. And what could happen? Good night. - Good night. I've never been to this town. I think you fit in here really well. It also has a retro touch... But I don't mean the room. I mean the suburban town. And I thought you were charming. Come on. You two are realists. You do gardening on your balcony. That's not left-wing, it's neo-conservative. A detached house is the next inevitable step. Living in a Volvo isn't that cool either. The next inevitable step for you is wearing Crocs and living in a camper. Or I’ll steal your glasses and apply for the film academy. They'd definitely take me. Then I’ll make a bleak Austrian drama, set on a council estate. Everyone's depressed. Are these glasses real or fake? I don't see a difference... You don’t need glasses. Daddy. Oh, my. Come here. Didn't you put a nappy on Elis? - Of course not. Come, my little one. I’ll clean you up. Elvis, come here. Elvis... Daddy! - Daddy will be back tomorrow. I’ll clean you up. Luis is doing yoga. Can we? Not today. - Come on. I even stretched. - I think she's homesick. Who knows for which home. You don't let Aimée sleep here anymore. - She's more mature and stable than Elvis. And it's important to set boundaries right now. Well, I don't really understand why this has to be in the film. Do you even have a concept? I’ll take her to the hospital. You stay here. Or should we take her, too? - I don't know. I'm having a sweating attack. - Where the fuck is my mobile? By your bed, as usual. Please call back. Thanks. Aimée? Calm down now. I promise it won't hurt, okay? Don't be afraid. All righty. Good girl. Would you like this plaster? Yes. - Okay. It's a nice one, too. Feel free to cry. Don't tell me when to cry. Chris, it's me again. Why is your mobile turned off? Call me hack when you get my message. Thanks. Aimée. So, we've done the tetanus injection. And I’ll note down when to give Alice the antibiotics. Elvis. - Excuse me? Elvis, not Alice. - I see. Like... Yes, like... You'll need to come back tomorrow. The day after tomorrow, we'll stitch Elvis' wound. The bite wound on her arm is quite deep. And I'd like my colleague to take a look at the eye injury. He's a plastic surgeon. He'll stitch it up so it heals perfectly. So I can take her home now? - Yes, of course. Daddy. - We'll call Daddy now. And how is she? Can you take her home? It's a good sign, right? I couldn't get hold of Chris. - Great. Ines, I’ll take you home. - No, thanks. Come on, please. Ines. I'm so fucking sorry. We failed. It's... I wouldn't talk to me either. Guilt is such a shitty word. And suddenly I get sentimental And then I know what I need And what I want {need an overdose of emotions Disorganised, provincial bitch! Really! Shit. Fuck. She's asleep. It's my fault, right? It could also be my fault. Because I wanted to have a boy and now she's confused about her gender and puts up with anything. I slept with Stella. I've had enough of hanging around you, all sad, waiting for you to grow up. Move back in. What? You're the best father I know. And we always got along well. You've never given me a compliment. Don't get cheesy now. Did it have to be Stella? Leaving already? - We're not welcome anymore. Not until the circumscribes are resolved. - You mean “circumstances”. They're treating her like a criminal. - I'm sure you misunderstood that. I don't give a damn what they say. They can go hang. So girls, want to hang out with us at the vegan ice cream shop over there? You know, today I wanted to... It's okay. No, I... - I've got it. I'm up to my ears in... - Just forget it. I could also do with a friend to talk to right now... Everyone else is so incredibly subjective. But we're all concerned. It could also happen here at the nursery. I suggest we discuss it at the parents' evening. We won't expel her for a bite. These things happen. But it wasn't just a bite. We're talking about two flesh wounds. If she'd bitten Elias... The world is coming to an end. You deceive yourself for a while, but you can't have both, freedom and love. And with a child, it's ultimate love and that has consequences. Thanks. Shall I talk some more? No. Would you like a coffee? - Yes, sure. Well, actually, I have to go. So, no, thanks. I was thinking of making a food blog. Food pictures are the new baby pictures. Keep it simple. Don't you like the idea? I'm quitting the film project. No one wants to be part of it anyway. We all want to be part of it. It's your passion. You totally love it. It's half-baked, superficial bullshit. Like everything I've ever done. I think everything you do is great. - You don't know anything about me. Well, maybe. But... But I know your ascendant and know two days before you do that you're getting your period. And you always eat exactly 90 grams of pasta. And when you buy expensive bread, you swap the wrapping for a cheaper brand because I'd complain that you'd bought overpriced bread. And you only fart when I'm not in the room. Yes, I'm afraid you're right. And it's so depressing. I'm so boring. I can't be cool anymore. I keep trying to fight it, but it's just too exhausting. I'm none of these things. I'm not a filmmaker. I'm not a sexy mummy. I don't have a front basket... Even you are too cool for me. I can't keep up with your coolness, with your nonchalance, with your hipster moustache. And your collection of vinyl records. I don't get what the problem is. We've got everything. And that's fucked up? - Its... Everything: the film, the hair style, Chris... I do it all because I need something, even though I don't need anything. What do you need from Chris? I don’t need anything from Chris. I don't know... I could have also said Ines. Are you getting bored of me? I just explained it. I'm getting bored of myself. Aren't you happy? Happiness! Who still believes in that? That's what this is about: because we know each other, we can be totally frank and say what we really feel. {have to take a shit. Nice start. It feels like we're playing truth or dare. You don't have to join in. - { do. You need someone good-looking. I don't find her aggressive at all. She's fun and accessible and focussed. Maybe a bit impatient sometimes, but... I stopped breastfeeding too soon. - You breastfed her for 23 months? At some point the nursery didn't want me to come by at noon to breastfeed her. So I'm guilty that she's a psycho now, right? How would you define guilt? How can you talk like that about our child? The therapy doesn't aim to examine the issue of responsibility. Each person has to resolve this for themselves. Can you please just tell us that our child is normal? How would you define normal? We just want everything to be okay again. You're a great woman. Really. But sometimes you just talk shit. It's just a language thing. He can't blame me for that, right? Did you know that children mirror the emotions of their parents? And what does that mean? I'm sorry, but I don't understand. Children mirror the emotions... - I got that one. But... I understood the words, but how does that help us here? You're here because your child bit another child. I think she needs to pee. - Does it have anything to do with you? Excuse me? Is that concept new to you? That children act out their parents' emotions? Particularly the suppressed emotions. I think she needs to pee. She's not used to those yet. No. Excuse me, but she's not used to those yet. The potty? -No... All right. Well, okay. These anarchistic traits are part of the defiant phase. Nothing unusual. - Did you hear, Aimée? Is recognition an issue for you? - For me? Are we talking about me now? - Itis an issue. I have to get out of here or I'll pee right here, too. Sorry. We can't let it get to us. We shouldn't let this upset us. We're doing everything right. It's all my fault. What? I'm doing everything alone here. Is that how you see it? - Yes. So that's how you see it. Yes. Who's that? Just a drunk. Hey! Ines! Chris! Open the door! It's Luis. - Really? I'm sorry. Mignon is sorry, too. Dude, go home. Our children are sleeping. Oh, sorry. Yes, I know. Once they finally go to sleep... Cool. Have a nice evening. Come on! What our children do isn't our fault! Go home, you're annoying. And you're being so embarrassing. At least I can show my emotions. Show them to someone else. Super. You're digging a great hole. Xaver. Xaver. Look over here, Xaver. I want to take a picture. Can you smile? Are you coming back to the nursery? Once the stitches have been removed. Is it healing okay? She might have a scar, but that'd look cool. Get lost, Teletubbie! Are you deaf? I don't care if you fuck him. That's... That's not what I want. Why did you do it then? Because I don't know why I'm not happy. Does anyone get me? I think she gets you. I was about to call you. Hi there. I've made millet burgers. Just fry them. And there's a joint on the windowsill. - Where are you going? To parents' evening. It's the first Tuesday of the month. Shall I take her with me? Do you have to work? I'm leaving you now. I’ll call you about Lola as soon as I know where I'm staying. What... What... Now? Just like that? I can't analyse it right now. But it's not easy. Well, it looks pretty easy right now. Come on... I'm so sorry. Has she lost it? You can cook and you've got a big cock. Thank you. She never said that to me. And you've got a child. A normal child. Everything's going well for you guys. You know what? We'll talk to her. That puts my mind at rest. If you two talk to her... Everything will definitely be absolutely fine again if you talk to her! Hi, honey. Oh, hold on. Shall I open the door for you? Do you take the lift? Here you go. And by the way, you have to stop Lola crying so much. Mine never cried that much. And her hair... It's always hanging in her face. Be careful, she might get defective vision. Okay. Thanks. Deep waters are murky, huh? I thought we were doing everything right. You can't be half a parent, ma belle. You have to give everything for your child and for your partner. You refused the pelvic base exercises. Who's still having a good fuck? Me. Wy pelvic base isn't the problem. And what is the problem? Do you even know? Yes. No. No idea. Everything... I don't fit into all that anymore. Your laziness really sucks. “Oh, the world is shit. My bike is undecided. My boobs are ruined. I’ll make a great film. I won't make one. I’ll take my friend's guy..." You do speak French! You always said you only knew English! Go home and deal with your aggressive child! At least I'm not abandoning her! That means “shitty weather"! - So what? I don't give a shit. Hi. Come on, I’ll drive you. - No, thanks. Where are you going anyway? Shall we go back to that suburban town? Or you can come and stay with us. Ines also agrees: monogamy is over. So, perhaps you can tell us how you think we should deal with the situation? I think they should sort it out amongst themselves. Who? - I think Elvis' mum means the children. But how can they? We have to... It's our job, isn't it? Am I the only one who thinks that? - I'd like you to discuss the issue first. I think you're overestimating the kiddies' social skills. Exactly. - As if we have amazing social skills. Well, I hope so. For example, you're laughing... - Is that forbidden? No, but you're laughing to send us a message. We have to interpret it. But maybe I don't feel like it. Maybe I'd rather you told us what you think. Kids always do that. - Well... Your kid isn't known for her eloquence... - Please! Hey, Wanja's dad, we don't bash other people's children, okay? Well, Aimée would really love to come back here. She misses her friends. Well, I think... - Let's go for a beer. I'm in. And... I think it was great to talk, wasn't it? I'm not sure if you're done here yet. - We are. Well, I think a lot has happened and we managed to discuss a lot. Thanks. On behalf of the kids, too. Juice with sugar? Do you mind if I cry? Pull yourself together. Already? - Yes, grow up. A relationship means compromises. Fucking hell, I can't drink again. No way. Really? 13th week. If you've got it, flaunt it. Sorry. Congrats. Elvis... - Congrats. Want a sausage? Everyone's having one. Hi. Hi, my little darling. I'm sorry. Well? - Sorry. You don't have to be sorry. Let's be honest. You're coming back to her, not to me. I don't know that yet. So, what's there to talk about then? Emotions aren't fair. So you don't have to apologise. Let's move to a different neighbourhood. Why? We'll enrol Lola in a public nursery. I don't understand. You'll do your blog and I’ll make the film. Well, that's the first thing you've said today that makes any sense. But... Mummy is sitting at the table and Daddy is cooking. Mouse. Green. I like black. This is yellow. - Exactly. Hi. - Hi, there. I'm so curious. Dude, did it have to be at the end of the line? Hi. Hi. Nice. And do you have any customers? A few around noon. But the kids' cooking classes aren't going well. People round here don't have the money. I think they make fun of you. Now I repair bicycles. And I enjoy it. You went to the film academy for this? Among other things. Don't you feel alone out here? We do, but that was the plan.
