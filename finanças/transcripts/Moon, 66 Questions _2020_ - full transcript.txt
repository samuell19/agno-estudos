When we really fall in love with someone, this is how they are, as when we fall in love with them. It's different, if later on they can't be themselves. In reality, the person we fell in love with and saw through the prism of love, this is how they really are. Later, they themselves can't stand how good they are. You're sure you're okay that we switched places? Yes, I like the window seat. I like seeing things. Has it been a long time since your last visit? Yes, a long time. And? Are you happy? No, I'm not happy to be honest. I mean, I'm not returning for a good reason. Sorry, I didn't mean to get into an uncomfortable conversation. No, it's okay, no worries. I haven't quite understood what happened myself so... They called me suddenly and told me that he had disappeared. He couldn't be found anywhere. One day a friend of his found him in his car. Completely dehydrated. Nobody knows how many days he had been in there. - And now... That person...? - He's at the hospital. - Oh, okay! Because I thought... - Yes, yes, I know. And... I didn't understand. Who did all this happen to? To my father. - Your father? - Yes. Oh, because of the way you were speaking... I thought it was someone not close to you. What does "close to you" mean? Have you spoken at all? No. But we never really did speak, actually. And what does that mean? We don't... speak. Let's say that we have a communication problem. I mean... since I was very little. I spoke to him and he didn't... I asked and he never responded. It's a weird situation. I mean... There's a huge distance. He sounds like the typical case of dad that is always busy. They didn't know how to show affection to their children. Yes, yes... I think I'm going to take a nap, if you don't mind. MOON, 66 QUESTIONS. Come on, sit over there. I've got this. Make yourself comfortable. There's a long way to go! A FILM ABOUT LOVE, MOVEMENT, FLOW (AND THE LACK OF THEM) Hi, Paris. Artemis? Can I sit? I should get going. - Why? - Why? He's embarrassed. He's too shy with you. He's like a child now. Does it hurt? A little. June 19th. Gena Rowlands' birthday. Zero visitors. The fridge still stinks, although I threw everything out. The doctor said her favourite line again yesterday. "The system attacks the system. That's the definition of autoimmune." I asked her why. It's strange at home. Although Paris is a different person, I still feel the way I used to. As if I make him uncomfortable. Mom doesn't pick up. The moon is a day and a half old. Alright, three sets of 20 ab exercises underwater, and then another three sets of glutes. - Really? Three? - Yes, and then some cardio outside. Can't we do cardio in the water? It's too hot outside! - Fifteen... - I don't feel so good. Sixteen! Only four left! Don't faint now! Seventeen... Eighteen, nineteen... twenty! We have to do this every day? Yes, for a month, otherwise it won't work! - Coming in or just watching? - I vote number two. - Why, my darling girl? - I don't feel like getting wet. Who doesn't feel like swimming in June? And then, an entire week goes by and I'm checking my phone 24/7. Obsession! I'm freaking out, I don't know what to text him. I think it was around when we found out that you got back. So, I remember our friend's awesome, inimitable strategy. "I'm sorry for bothering you, but I got a bad feeling. Are you okay?" Same as telling him, "You're part of my anxiety disorder." And he just never said anything back! Nothing! Can you imagine? - But you know he never does. - What do you mean? Paris, can I come in? Not yet. What about now? Now. Okay? Do you need another one? Yes. Do you want me to stay or go? Go. How will he help him? If we say to have coffee at eight, and you come at nine: Disrespect! But he decided to build his house in the middle of nowhere. Here he is! You're always nagging! - Good evening. - Good evening. I'm Kostas, the patient's brother. - Hello. I'm Angelos. - This is the patient. Nice to meet you. Is it Paris? Hi, I'm his sister, Anna. Tons of mosquitoes here! Since forever. Alright. - Would you like to see the MRI? - I'd like to see the patient first. If I need the MRI, I'll tell you. This is Artemis, his daughter. Where should we do the physio? - Right here. - Here. There's plenty of space. So that we can all watch. His daughter has to learn this. - Alright. - Yes, she must learn! - Should we move the... - Stamatis. - Carefully. - Lift it carefully. It's very expensive. Let's go. Slowly. Carefully, Artemis. - Here? - Carefully. Good. Well, Angelos... - Wherever you think it's better. - Yes. - It's okay to be here, right? - Yes. - Good. - We should be next to him. That's a nice mat. I think we're fine here. Great. - He's really strong. - He was always fit. With multiple sclerosis, you cannot control your strength. Coordination of movements is almost lost... As with all autoimmune diseases, psychology is key. Humans are mysterious beings. Angelos, should we try to walk? Yes... Paris, are you up to? A little. Let's try to stand up. Are you okay? Should we try? Good. One step at a time. Try to intertwine your hands like before, so that they become one. Nice. Now stretch them as high as you can. Now take a deep breath... try to get up with my assistance. Put pressure on me, yes. That's it. You're really good. Nice. Awesome. Once you're ready, we'll turn around on your knees, so that we can get up together. Put your hands behind you... This goes here. Nice. Now, breathe. Leave your legs to me. Try to turn slowly. Nice. Perfect. We'll do it together. Way to go! Well done. Now, breathe. You're very good. I'll help you with your leg... Put all your weight on the left hand, and give me your right hand. Exactly. Yeah! What is it? Breathe again. Relax. It's okay. I'm here. I'm holding you. That's it. Control it with your mind. Yes! Trust, it's a matter of trust... That's it. When you're ready, lean on me, and we're getting up together. Put all your weight on your arms and right leg. Let's go. Good job. Grab my neck. One step forward. Left foot. Perfect. Let's get off the mattress. Angelos! Excuse me, can we talk on a first-name basis? - Yes. - Could you show these things to Artemis, too? - They're quite technical. - Yes. She should learn how to do it. Whoever takes care of him, it would be good to know some of the exercises. - Let's watch then. - Nice. Straighten up, breathe, lean on me. Perfect. Should I come over there? That's it. We made it. Nice. Artemis, I'll show you a way that is best for you, since you're close to him. You can let him hug you. Your hands on the pelvis. The other one too. That's it. Now, put your left hand on Artemis' arm. Perfect. There. And now you lead his pelvis with your hands. You shift the weight center, so that he can lift his leg. Yes! The other one now. Nice. Brief pauses. Straighten up. Breathe, take your time. And let's move to the next step. Don't worry. I'm here. You'll figure it out. It's like dancing. Control it and straighten up. Keep your head up. Great. Well done, Artemis. You lead. Mom. Please. Come just for a few days. He's really unwell, I won't manage. Your dad knew about it, and once again he acted as if he didn't know. Come for me mom, to help, to keep me company! I can't. We're leaving, anyway. When are you coming back? I will be going back and forth. Manolis will stay till the end of the season. I love you so much. We'll see and we'll decide. We'll do our best. Paris, do you like flowers? We should have brought him all those flowers from the clinic. - By the way, what became of them? - Who would take care of them? - There's no one there. - The lady. We'll ask her, if she can. Maybe we should buy her the "Gardener's helper". - Do you remember the commercial? - With the flowers... Remind me. "You have pots in the balcony greenery in your living room". - Do you remember? - We need to be serious when she comes. Let her come first. We must ask her a few things. This is Marina. You could sit there. Hello. - Welcome. - Thank you for coming. Where are you from? She doesn't reply. Would you like something to drink or eat? Paris is... You should be asking these questions. Is there anything to offer her? How about ice cream? - From where? - From the kiosk. - Bring some mosquito repellent too. - It's windy today. - I wonder how they sleep. - It's windy. The mosquitoes are gone. - Paris, don't they bother you? - The woman is here. Have you got kids? She does not reply! You'll have to sleep here. - Prior experience? - Have you worked before, for someone who... I like her, anyway. She looks nice. How much do you weigh? She doesn't talk. She doesn't have to talk, she has to lift. Ice-cream? - Aunt, any ice-cream? - As if she could speak English. - Any ice-cream? - English, mom. I'm a bit concerned. I'm afraid she won't be able to communicate. Paris always kept to himself, now even more so. He doesn't say a word. So, she won't be able to learn Greek by hearing him. I'm afraid he will be socially isolated. On the plus side, she won't be able to gossip. Even if she did, who would she gossip with, Kostas? You really are something! What are you laughing at, Anna? Don't you remember Mrs. Sandy's Georgian woman? Everyone knew about the sick child. She's Bulgarian. Are you from Bulgaria, sweetie? Yes. Let's do the test. Are you from Romania? - She doesn't understand. - Yes. She always says yes. I think when these people say "Yes", it sounds like our "No"? - Yes. - When they nod "yes", they mean "no". Yes is more than enough. For now. I have change from the supermarket. I always throw it in my bag and it's too hard to find. I just can't understand why there's such a long queue. Every time. Every day. There are six cashiers, but only two or three work. Even only one. They let us stand in line forever and stare us like idiots. A girl asked me today if she could take my turn. "I have just one item." And I have two! You wanna compare and contrast? It's summer, you're a young girl. Why all this angst? Because I look after my sick uncle. He could fall and hurt himself any time. Is he very old? No, he's just 54. But he looks old. He looks like an old man. What happened to him, if I may ask? Something like a stroke. No one knows really. You must love him a lot. Yes, he's my favourite uncle. July 16th. The Catcher in the Rye gets published. I cook lentils. First time. I found a box full of VHS tapes in the garage. But I don't know how to watch them. They're a bit like Paris. He's right in front of me but I can't see him, I can't talk to him, get to know him. What did he like to look at? What used to catch his eye? Wow! Poor guy! You used to play, right? You want to sleep? Excuse me. Can I have a drink, please? Neat, yes. - Where have you been? - At Patmos. Here is our errand girl! - How are you? - Good. I would hug you, but I'm too sweaty. Paris, is everything okay? Definitely better than the last time I saw him. I never expected you to manage. - I'm sorry, but... - Excuse me, Mr. Iakovos, but how did you get in? I... What? Are you kidding me? How? Crawling? I'm deeply moved. I've known you for so long... I never thought you two would make amends. Good evening miss, how may I help you? Firstly, I'd like to thank you for having me at such short notice. Of course. Tell me. Hello. Well... Since I returned to Athens... I don't see dreams. At least, I don't remember them. I saw one the other day. A dream that, whenever I try to write down or think about it... I see it again. But I'm not asleep. It's like reality is mixed with the dream. It has never happened before. Should I tell you? I'm walking on dirt... There where scarce grass, like thin hair. I'm not sure if it was grass, but I looked down... and I'm legless. I mean, I have legs, but they're shod. Like a pony or a deer, something like that. I'm not sure. I'm scared that I'm not in a human body. Maybe the disease is that everyone has transformed... into something. I start looking for my dad, but I don't know where or what he's turned into. And I'm thinking, "If I'm a deer... "he's probably a deer, too". From a distance, I see water and go there, for I'm very thirsty. I see something resembling a fish. I go and take a closer look, and I see my dad on the ground. He has a very big tail. He's half human, half fish. I want to scream, but I can't. I have to tell him to swim towards me. I don't do it, although I can. I want to, but I can't, but I know that I can. It's time. Shall we cooperate? Paris. Paris. I'm sorry, but you have to get that injection. I'm talking to you. Can you please help me? Go away. What are you doing? I'm watching. Do it yourself. It must be really nice at the Varkiza house. I heard the sea is right at your front door. You don't need a car or anything. You just get up, and in five minutes you're in the water. Everyone will go. Really. Even Evi, whose mom is very strict, got permission to go. Probably because she knows we'll be perfectly safe. Artemis, please. I thought I made myself clear. End of story. Please, dad! Come on, dad! I beg you! Everyone else is going. How can I be the only one who stays behind? Please! We'll be staying in the house, we'll swim, play... Why are you so absolute? There will be no cars! We'll be just 15 people. Please! All my friends are going! Artemis, I've had my say! Forget about Varkiza! Get it out of your mind! Stop wasting my time! But, dad... July 28th. Alice in Wonderland premieres. Jackie O's birthday. There was something else, too. I can't remember. Some war, perhaps? I have forgotten about the past. Both mine, and his. I miss him. What is it that I miss exactly? The phone rarely rings. Mr. Iakovos brought us two kittens. Paris seemed very happy. His limbs are always cold. It's incredible. As if iced water runs through his veins, instead of blood. Could he be healed by the warmth of love? The Moon is 6.2 days old. Mom doesn't pick up. I saw him. Shut up. Yes, stop it, dude. Some problem with the knees, I guess. No. That's Parkinson's! Parkinson's affects the hands. And old people. Don't look, man. What? What? I want to sit. Excuse me, can you give me a chair? - Yes. - A plastic one or whatever. - Do you need help? - Thanks. Dad! What happened? Dad! Are you okay? Are you hurt? Are you hurt? What happened? Was I too late? I'm sorry. Fetishes are fetishes! I'm aware that my collection is at least strange. Oh, not at all, why do you say that? There's only one thing missing. Oh, really? What? One eye. Oh, I have two! You want one? Just a moment. Are you ready? Shall we? First question. What's the percentage of disability? I don't know. Step one is to place the feet. Step two. Give me your hand to release the break. That's it. Let's do it together. This is the break. Great. Grab tightly with your fingers. Great. There you go. Do the same on the other side. Come on. You can do better. That side as well. You always forget to use both of your hands. Firmer grasp! Good. There. Good! Better. Let's do it! Very good. This way... Oops! Sorry, I didn't see you. Look, put your hands here... and you push to go forward... or back. Forward... and back. Look. And back. You can do whatever you want! You can turn. Bye! - Sit down. - Okay. - Put the ball here... - Okay. Strike a feminine pose. Feminine? How? Go like this or like that. - Like that? - That's it. Bend over a little more. Yes. - Should I add a filter? - It's up to you. Okay. Did you see the photo Lydia uploaded? - Before you were... - What do you mean? Okay, let's do it. Reach out with your arms. Come on, firmly now. More! Good. Artemis, why wasn't I notified? Why did you make such a decision without consulting me first? You can understand that the wheelchair will destroy him! Patients stop trying to walk! And... And what should I do, lock him up inside the house? We can't stay inside, because I drop him. I can't stand it. My back, my neck, my arms hurt! I can't lift him any more! I'm following your instructions for two months. There's no change, nothing. Hydrotherapy, physiotherapy, everything! Nothing happens! One day he's like this, the next he's different. One day, he stands up, the next — nothing! One day, he talks, the next, he says nothing. One day is shit, next is okay. One day is shit, next is okay. Calm down! Don't raise your voice to me! Calm down! What? That you're eating like that... Ice cream is my favorite food! I don't understand why you're laughing. Is that so funny? Can I eat my ice cream in peace? Stop it, before something happens to you! I think I'm losing it! What are you doing? Where are you off to? Where are you going? To the... party. What party, daddy? August 12th. Cleopatra commits suicide. I'm praying. For the first time. As Anna says, we've got a "nurse audition". I wish we find someone soon. I can't take it anymore. His glasses are always blurry. But he never says anything. Doesn't he care about seeing? This is our mother. This is my sister, Anna. I'm Kostas. And our young one, Victoria. - Say hi, Victoria! - Hi! Hi. - Do you want to show us? - No. Come on, baby! Do it for me! Do it for daddy! Just once! I beg you. That's it! Some music. - I messed it up. - That's okay, start again. She plays beautifully. Well done! - Now play the other one... - That's enough! Just a little! Well done! Okay, you can play the rest later. Enough for now. Enough. Do you... Do you have kids? - Yes, three. - Just like me. - So, what's your name? - Michaela. Michaela, what you see is what you get. The doctor said the damage is irreversible. He needs constant supervision, exercise. A very nice gentleman will be coming for his physio. You'll meet him. The most important thing is the treatment. The exact spot where you need to inject him every time. After each injection, you'll check it on your list. You know, a check mark. Alright? The expert there can tell you more. He's still young. What happened to him? It was a birth defect. Paris was wrapped in the umbilical cord. The cord was like a messenger bag... across his body. I was in labor for 15 hours. He didn't want to come out. The terrible secret is out! You got it, mom, it was the birth. - Not what came later. - What do you mean? What are you talking about? One. One more. - Are we getting there? - Yes. A bit longer. One more. Hold my hands firmly. Take a breath. Let go of my hand. Don't be afraid. I'm right here. Breathe. Let go. Come on. Do it yourself. Come on. I'll be right back. Chill man, you're not Ma Long! - Who's that guy? - Stop asking and start playing, we are losing! It's not my fault! Break! The champion took her clothes off! Come on, now... My bad, sorry. Come on! Fuck off! Now she knows! Finally. Much better now. October 9th. Iakovos, I saw you... I saw both of you in the mall. I didn't greet you. You were with Efi. You seemed happy. I didn't want to bother you. I'm waiting for Friday. Good, let's go. Five. And another five, ten. First word. First one? All together. You're crazy? Zorro. The Expendables! You killed her. The Gladiator. No, she's coming back to life. Something with zombies? She looks like one anyway. Karate Kid! Matrix! Matrix! - What's that thing crawling? - The Exorcist! Return of... Return of the living dead! Zombie! Come on! Batman and Spiderman! It is a sci-fi movie, right? You... You try to be Stallone. You hit yourself, kill yourself? Suicide! Rocky Balboa! You kill her, but she's fine! She's immortal. No, she's not. She's a goddess. King Kong! - Fuck! - Count Dracula! No. The girls are trying. Arm. What a clown, man. Choke me. Harder. - I don't get it. - A bit awkward, man. Nice. Where are they from? From Veria. Good, aren't they? They're delicious. Are the peaches good, Mr. Iakovos? Try one. No, thank you. Help him. No, he can do it himself. I can do it. When you are here, he does a lot of things on his own. It's so big, I cannot eat it all. Do you like it? It was a good idea to bring them, wasn't it? Please, let me... No, I can do it. What's the matter? What happened? Where is the helmet? Do you want some? It's apple pie! You hit me! Are you crazy? - Do you know what I've been through? - Calm down! - Did you ever care? - What's your deal? Have you pictured what I've been through? - It was your choice! - No one asked you to be there! No one expected that from you! I'm asking something else! Don't act like a mom! Don't act like a mom! Why didn't you tell me the truth about Paris? - What? - Why didn't you tell me the truth? - What truth? - The truth about Paris. I know why he was suffering. You know, too. If you could accept it, everything could be better. It wasn't my job to tell you. - Whose job was it? - Your dad's! - I am sorry! I am sorry! - You're not answering my question. - Why... - I ask to be forgiven! Can you hear me? I'll take your precious apology put it in my pocket, and everything will be cool. How does that sound? - I hope so. - Fine. It was nice talking to you. Me too. Dad. Dad, I found something out. Won't you ask me, what? No. Ask me. What? I can do this. Do you remember her? What if he speaks? Could he get well, like magic? Do you like it? The fish. Very much. How long since you last drank wine? I don't remember. How could you? It's a letter. For you. From me! I know you won't have the patience to read it, so I'll read it to you. Should I? No... I will... I will read it myself. I can do it. Where are you going? What are you doing? What will happen next? What will happen next?
