Toho A Toho Production What is that? No way! After School Couldn't Tsutomu make it today? He went to another exhibition. Tsutomu wants to photograph nudes. - Maybe he wants to photograph you. - Shut up! Did you get the photo? - What? - Ayako in the nude. No. What are you staring at? Natsuko's going to be late tonight. Again? She's a bad wife. She's busy. I need something for dinner. The meat is over there. - Your dad was transferred? - Yes. - Where to? - Hokkaido. - Has he already left? - Yes. - But your mom is still around. - No, she went with him. Helicopter moms usually stick in Tokyo. So, you're on your own. Cool! Naah, I'm staying with a friend of my dad's from work. Lame. - You should kick him out of the house. - What? Then we can hang out there. Hold this. Aoki Kenji Kitazawa Ayako! What? Clean up over there a little. It gets dusty in this sunny weather. Ayako! You're kind of a slob. We both had to rush off this morning. Did you miss the alarm clock? - What? - I'll clean up. Why don't you come over when Natsuko is late? I don't want to leave Tsutomu alone. He could eat dinner at my place. He's home. Who are they? Fast by Yosui Inoue Who's that? It's Natsuko, Kenji's wife. Lemme see. Nice, I like them like that. Like what? Like a teacher I had in middle school. I sure liked her. She looks just like her. You knucklehead! What's this? It's just photos of her. They're all blurry. Tsutomu, are you in love with her or something? You dodo, I was going for a soft focus. You were going for what? He was going for an older woman. Oooh! Ayako! Ayako! What? I was supposed to help in the kitchen. She knocked everything over! She's going for an older man. Are you OK? That was hot. Tsutomu would probably have been better off joining his parents in Hokkaido. He said he's glad he stayed here. Oh, really? I guess he didn't feel comfortable around them. - Not at all. - What? Don't stir it so much. - Oh, I see. - Do you understand? No. Where are you going? Dad was waiting to play shogi with you. That's because I whupped him in a game last night. Then it's a reve... reve... A revenge match. He went to meet Natsuko. What? A little closer. You too, Ayako. A little to your left. One more. Like this? Tuck your chin. You want to be a fashion model, don't you, Megumi? One more. - I'm tired. - I'm thirsty. My modeling fee is a cup of coffee. Damn. Who is she? - I don't know. - I know! - You know her? - She's Katsuhiko's big sister. You mean the high school junior? Really? - This is the place. - What? Katsuhiko said that his sister works in a bar in Aoyama. This is the place. This is a hot item. I'm glad I got it. She's beautiful. Naturally. She's Katsuhiko's sister. He has a knack with the ladies. I'm sure she's popular with men. - Yeah, probably. - Yes, certainly. What if we show this to Natsuko? - She'll be furious. - Don't show it to her! We should mind our own business. - Do you think so? - Yes, I do! Still, it's a good photo... and a hot item. - Enough already. - It's not that big of a deal. How come? Kenji just bumped into her at a bar he frequents. But they're practically hugging. She's right. Kenji isn't that kind of a person. But isn't Kenji popular with women? - No, he isn't. - Yes, he is. He's fine. Is he? - Yes, he's dreamy. - He's not dreamy. Natsuko always gets her way with him. That's because Natsuko has a strong personality. Yeah, yeah. That's why they make such a good couple. - Really. - Totally. I bet they're always snuggling in front of you every night. Every night. And you get worked up and can't sleep at night. No, not at all. They're so into each other... I hate men! - The photo doesn't prove anything! - You're a child. No, I'm not. I'll show this to Kenji. - Let's do it! - I'll make him treat us to tea. That's small potatoes. Think bigger. I'm home. What's this? What got into you? Is it a dirty photo? You're early today. Yes, I finally get to leave work early, and Kenji has to work late. Really? I never see my husband anymore. - That has to change. - What? Don't worry, we're doing OK. - Because you love each other? - Because you trust him? That's right. Tsutomu, show me the photo. Tsutomu, what are you up to? Show it to her. There's nothing to hide. - That's right. - What's gotten into you? Oh, it's Kenji! Who's he with? You don't know? No, did you take it in secret? Yeah, I took it when he wasn't looking. That's uncool. You should respect his privacy. I could use this to embarrass him. It's not nice. But I won't. I often meet, talk to, and have tea with other men. I'm get home late every night. So I can't really make a big deal of it. True enough. - What the hell? - What? What a jerk. It's an invasion of privacy. That's what I told him. The three of them seemed disappointed. Why? I think they were hoping I'd be angry. Unbelievable. I think it was at the end of last year... A woman quit the company and got a job at a bar in Aoyama. I sometimes go there with friends from work. I ran into her on the street today. You don't have to explain. I was just letting you know. Evidently her little brother is a handsome straight-A student and an athlete. They said that all of the girls are crazy about him. I don't think she mentioned him. They said he's very serious and takes no interest in girls. Actually, Yuki is pretty sharp too. Her name is Yuki? I'm impressed that she's sending him to school. Are you going to take a bath? I wonder if it's just the two of them. I wouldn't know. If you're going to do it, do it now. - Do what? - The bath. - What should we do? - Nothing. - This is our chance. - Don't! - He can't get away! - This is idiotic! - I'm telling him. - What are you going to say? - "I saw your sister..." - What?! - "She was with a man." - Cut it out. Look! I wonder where he went. Excuse me. Katsuhiko... - I met your sister. - Oh? - She was with a man. - Really? The man's name was... Kenji Kitazawa? I might know his face. I help at the bar until early evening. They looked like lovers. You're probably right. That's my sister... She has a lot of boyfriends. - She does? - She plays around. "Plays around"? She has her life and I have mine. It's none of my business. I wonder if Kenji is like that. - He's hiding something. - Are you sure? - He's dirty. - I still don't believe it. You're a child. No, I'm not. I feel bad for Natsuko. Tsutomu? Are you sick? I have a toothache. Your wisdom tooth again? Yep. You should have had them pulled all at once. That's true. Stay in bed. I can make dinner. I'm sorry. Don't worry. I'll get you some water. Thank you. Tsutomu, don't tell Natsuko what I said. What's wrong with you? Absolutely do not tell Natsuko! - You moron! - You can't tell me what? - Here's your water. - Thank you. The pain has subsided a little. So, what did you have to tell me? Kenji is horrible. He's fooling around on you. You should punch him. He's horrible, horrible! I understand she has a lot of boyfriends. - Eh? - She likes to play around. You mean Yuki? That's what her brother told Ayako. - She said that? - Are you one of them? One of who? She's your type, isn't she? You're being foolish. All because of that photo. I can tell. It fits together. Cut it out. - Another glass? - No. It will dull your toothache. I don't mind quitting my job. I'd be better off just being a homemaker. Maybe I really will quit. I don't really like working outside the home. I'd be better off staying at home and... taking care of you and Tsutomu. Then you wouldn't be tempted to take up with young women. Enough. What are you talking about? You're being unreasonable. When do you think I fell in love with this young woman? Natsuko. Ouch, my tooth hurts. When do you think I fell in... - Let it go. - No, I won't. - Just be quiet. - What? Stop it. Hey. It hurts. Ooh, stop. I said, stop. - Out of bounds. - Got it. I know it's around here somewhere. You should give up. You don't want to know who your husband's mistress is. Yes, I do. You said you're not even sure if he's been unfaithful. No man is actually going to admit to it. It's probably a little closer in. It's around here. No, it's around here. Are you sure? Did you find it? I think it went even farther. I didn't hit it that far. Yes, you did. There it is! Are you OK? - Where's the ball? - I don't know. We must've lost it. This is it. Let's go. In my experience, it's best not to see her face. - But... - It will just rile you up. And hurt her feelings. Come again. Please come in. - Coffee. - Me too. Two coffees. Is it her? Is that the little brother? There you go. Maybe I should ask where the owner is? Don't. I thought you went to the dentist. I did, but it still hurts. Let's go home. OK, let's go. - What's the rush all of a sudden? - Let's go! There you go. Thank you. - Can I... - Never mind. Thank you. His older sister is probably beautiful. She didn't seem so pretty in the photo. That was mortifying. I shouldn't have come. Wait a second... - Is that her? - I'm not sure. - I'm pretty sure. - Really? This is your masterpiece. Your masterpieces are always dirty. One really is my masterpiece. What do you think? I'm home! Don't. What is it? More photos? It's Tsutomu's masterpiece. - Another hot item? - No, this time... It's a dirty masterpiece. Show it to her. I don't want to. Not to a lady. You showed them to me! - That's because you're frigid. - Frigid? Yep, you don't feel anything. - That's because it's not artistic. - If you say so. I don't want to see Tsutomu's photos anymore either. You don't have to. - I have to study. - Me too. You don't have to run off. Yes, I do. Goodnight. Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. I'm tired. You're still tired, on Sunday? Yes, I'm still tired. Did you go to the dentist? Yes, a friend introduced me to him. In Aoyama. Aoyama? I stumbled upon the bar Candy when I was walking. You're lying. You went looking for it. Maybe it was not quite truthful to say I stumbled upon it... I was paying attention while I was walking. - I knew it was around there. - Serves you right. Don't be angry. I'm being honest with you. Were you? I didn't intend to go in, but my friend wanted to. Don't hit me! No violence! My tooth hurts. Idiot. Yuki wasn't there. It's true. But her brother was very handsome. I can see why Ayako is crazy about him. If you rush this over immediately, you can get it there by... It's rush hour now. We got the call at 20:30, so 21:00. - 21:00? - We're off. See you later. We're going to be here again until past 23:00. You should go home. I can handle it by myself. No, this is the job. Do you want something to eat? Let's go out. It's cold. How's your wife? She's OK. - The other day... - Yes? Nothing. - Another glass. - Yes, sir. Made it! Hold it! Megumi, over a little. Like this? - Ayako, get in the picture. - Yuck! Hurry up and take the photo! Ayako, don't look so grim. Look! - What is it? - It's Katsuhiko. Katsuhiko? - He just went out of sight. - Really? I'm positive. - Was he by himself? - No. Was he with his sister? With three friends... probably from the gymnastics team. If it's really Katsuhiko, we should talk to him again. This is our lucky day! You got changed already? I don't dawdle like you. - Who's there? - It's me. - I'm sorry. - It's OK. You can photograph me nude. I'll get the camera! He must've forgotten that he lent it to me. He wasn't thinking. Where's my camera? - It's right here. - That's right. What's wrong? - You're not nude. - No way. I was joking. Drat! Isn't Ayako is the one you want to photograph nude? Megumi, you look like Kenji's wife. You and Ayako look like lovers. Stop making funny noises. - Is that consomm?E - No. I ordered cream soup. Kenji and I ordered consomm?E Enjoy. - Thank you. - I told you so. I work here with my friends. You're the one who works at Candy's. What? Oh, yeah. I frequent there. Thank you. Excuse me. You seem quite embarrassed. I'm not used to being served by an upper-class man. Please enjoy. Look, they're from the gymnastics team. It's Minami. And Egawa. Scotch and soda. We're back. - We're back. - Welcome back. I'm glad the weather was good. Natsuko isn't here. She went to Kansai on business this morning. - Really? - She said it would be three days. But she also said that it might be four. That's too bad. We brought her food. That's right. - You have to come home early tonight. - I know. Come straight home. We're going to have sukiyaki. Sukiyaki? Now you're talking! Your neckties are all plain. Don't... I'll do it. Oh, this is the sash. Thank you. Your lapels are crooked. - It's all right. - No, it's not. Dinner smells good. Is Ayako still next door? She works like a maid there. I can never get her to help out around here. Two young men live next door. I see. She's 16. I see. It's a dangerous age to be. I see. She's all right next door. - Is she? - Yes, she is. - Excuse me. - What's up? I'm out of cigarettes. I'll go. Tsutomu, go pick up some cigarettes. I'll do it. Good evening. It looks like you wandered in from another century. It looks good on him. Scotch and soda. - Hey, it's you again. - Yep. How's Ayako? - Bring her around sometime. - Don't. Bring her by here, Kenji. Sometime. Don't do it. Don't you want me to meet her? - I want to meet her. - Cut it out! You got every answer right. So that's it. Kenji isn't back yet. Math is tough. I love math. It's the only subject that the answer is black and white. That's why you don't get my artistic photography. I have no idea where Kenji goes, or what he's thinking. Sorry. Unbelievable. Ayako, thank you for taking care of the house while I was away. You're welcome. I was worried that the house would be a mess when I got back, but I came back to find it neater than when I take care of it. I'm such a bad wife. - I've decided to quit my job... - You're going to quit? I'm going to quit and be a good wife. I was just talking to my mother about it. Why quit when you've got a good job? But this three-day business trip turned into five. It's too much. Anyhow, I'm going to ask them to transfer me to an easier job. I don't care if I take a pay cut. I want to live a normal life. I think I can be a good old-fashioned wife. Or maybe not. What do you think, Ayako? I'm sure you'll be fine... anyone can be a good wife. I'm sure I'll catch Kenji off guard with my transformation into a sweet wife. I'll have to demurely make dinner... for the first time in a long time. You're making me blush. I'm sorry. Honey, dinner. What a spread! It's been a long time since I made a proper dinner. - Where's Tsutomu? - I'll get him. Tsutomu, dinner! OK. - Give Tsutomu a glass. - Really? Just one. Are you hungry? Sorry it's late. - For me? - Just one glass. Yes, please. I'll have a glass myself. Go ahead. Kyoto is beautiful... Next time, I want to go for pleasure. - The two of you should go. - I sure want to. Where did you go for your honeymoon? Kyoto. What the heck? They get along really well. So what's the problem? Kenji and Natsuko are husband and wife. Where are the nail clippers? Where are they? Oh, the nail clippers. Come again. Why don't you take a break? You look pale. I know. A nap, even for five or ten minutes, will do you some good. I think I will. Could you help out a little? Just for an hour. Is this her? Do you like her? It's none of your business. Hold still. - It was a mosquito. - They're not out this time of year. Yes, they are... the big ones. It got away. There wasn't any mosquito. Yes, there was. Look. Look. Shut up! It's over here. Did you find it? What the heck? You idiot! Ouch! - Goodbye. - Goodbye. You only plan to apply to Tokyo University? It has to be Tokyo University? How come? - It's free. - Because it's the elite track? That's true too. - Let me try! - No! - Gimme! - No! Gimme!! Gimme! See you later. What's wrong? Hurry up! - Aren't you going home? - I want to walk some more. Take me to your place. Please come in. - You're Ayako, aren't you? - Yes. - This is Yuki and Miho. - So glad you came. We've been waiting. We really wanted to meet you. Have a seat. She said she wants to try my coffee. Let me through. We haven't seen Kenji for quite some time. What's he been up to? Natsuko comes home early these days. Natsuko? He's so sweet on his wife. I'm glad they're so happy. No, they're not happy. - Don't they get along? - They don't get along. Really? I guess you can't tell just by looking. I can tell. Of course you can. You're not a little girl. I have to go. - I'll see you home. - It's like you're kicking her out. - Can't you stay? - She can stay. Shut up! Goodbye. - I'll see you home. - That's OK. - Where's Tsutomu? - Huh? - Isn't Tsutomu with you? - I don't know. Four packs of 'Short Hope', please. 300 yen. I found two boxes in your kimono and in your suit. I put two boxes in my kimono, but the suit... That's strange. I found them. - Then they've been there a long time. - They weren't there this morning. When did you start checking my pockets? I haven't been checking them. Then don't get worked up over a box of matches. I'm not worked up. Yes, you are. Still, I don't know why they were in my suit. - Just stop. - It's strange. Enough, already. There's no saying what men do outside the home. - It's the same for women. - Enough! If that's what you really think, then you shouldn't get worked up over such a small thing. Do you feel the same way about me? I'm not telling you to feel, I'm just saying that we're flesh and blood human beings, and we should be prepared... - Enough! - You're acting strange. I am not. You just said that you don't know what men do outside the home. - If that's true... - I meant... I meant that you have to be prepared for anything. I knew that's what you were doing when you were out. You were at Candy's with that... You're jumping to conclusions. Why can't you understand? I can see from your face that there's nothing I can say. For the sake of argument, if I was having an affair with Yuki from Candy, would you be satisfied - "satisfied" is probably the wrong word, but you would have no reservations about divorce? - Do you want a divorce? - I didn't say that. You're being strange. When did you start... You've been acting strange lately. I've been acting strange because you've been acting strange. Let's stop talking about it. It's cold. Good evening. It's a gift from my father. He just got back from a business trip. Thank you. - Good night. - You're very kind. Hey! Ayako, did you by any chance... put matches from Candy's into my pocket. I don't know about that. Why? Never mind. Good night. - Goodbye. - Good night. This is getting ridiculous. I'll let you do the rest. "I want to get away from you for a while, so I can think. "If cooling off also means that my body, mind, and soul also go cold, "I may not return. Natsuko." - How many days has it been? - Four. I understand he looked everywhere... and finally telephoned her parents' home yesterday. Kenji should take out a newspaper ad: "Natsuko come home. Everything's OK." Everything's not OK, is it? A happy marriage has come to ruin, all because of me. What an honor. But the marriage has not yet come to ruin, has it? Yes, it's a calculated spat between husband and wife. It's conniving. I'm a pawn in a game that I'm not involved in. I'm enjoying it. Aren't you involved? No, I'm not! I should go. Your wife might be home already. I don't think she's coming back. Don't say that. Not with things like they are now. It sounds like you don't want her to come back. Please come in. What's wrong with you? Kenji's moving away. He's been transferred to Osaka. Kenji is going to up and move to Osaka, even with Natsuko missing? If she doesn't turn up by the end of the month. What a mess! Why did Kenji and Natsuko stop getting along all of a sudden? They're hot and cold. Couples are unstable at that age. Natsuko found a box of matches from Candy's in his pocket. It's a small thing to fight over. Hey, where's Ayako? She was just here! Closed It's none of your business who I sleep with! Don't go! You just told me to get out. You ruined our lives! Unbelievable. You and Katsuhiko aren't married, you know. We were just having fun, it didn't have anything to do with work, and it didn't ruin your lives. Oh, hello. You have a crush on Katsuhiko, don't you? He has a crush on you too. But I don't think he'll fall in love or marry... until he graduates Tokyo University... and finds a job at a top company. Will you get out already! OK, I'm leaving. Bye bye. I didn't know anything about it. I was careless. Especially in front of you, Ayako. Shut up! Go home, little girl! You need to pack these? I'll do it myself. I'm home! I can't believe you're back! You're just in the nick of time! - Are you angry, Kenji? - What? Are you angry because I lied? I was the one who put the matches from Candy's in your pocket. I love you, Kenji. I love you. - He's packing right now! - Oh, no! Wait! I'm going shopping, do you need anything? It can wait. I'll talk to you later. I'm sorry. I heard you were being transferred to Osaka. I am sorry. Were you helping him pack, Ayako? Welcome home. I've decided to quit my job. You helped me decide. I'll go with you to Osaka. Won't Osaka be fun? Osaka.
