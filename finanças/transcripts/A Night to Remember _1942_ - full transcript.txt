- We arrived, ma'am. Nº 13. - Thank you. Our new home. - Come on, Jeff. - It's here? Friend. Look. You like it? Does it look a bit gloomy? Darling, were you already thinking that you weren't going to like it? No, no ... I think it's okay. But there will be a lot of people, and you can talk to them and find out what they think. - It's 75 cents. - Stay with the change. - This place is familiar to me. - Me too. Here they gave me the biggest tip of my life. $ 25 to carry two bodies. - He just wanted to be nice ... - I hope so. They are just pigeons. Are you sure it was Gay Street 13? Come in. - It's Mrs. Troy, right? - And there's Mr. Troy. Dear... This is Mr. Turner. I was expecting you on Thursday. I know, but since the apartment was empty, we have come before. My husband is eager to work. Right, dear? - Well ... - We'll pay for the extra days. That's not the problem. They haven't installed the light yet and the cleaner didn't finish cleaning the house. Our furniture is on the way. They will be when they arrive. We have to find a solution. I would have liked you to see it beautiful and bright the first time. Maybe they can spend the night at the hotel. Tomorrow everything will be ready. - But the furniture ... - Exactly. We'll see. What was that? - It wasn't the clock striking six. - No. - Mr. Turner! It happened again! - That? I was cleaning the basement and that thing crawled off my feet. That thing? What thing? - Mrs. Salter, that's nonsense. - It is true. For a minute I was petrified. That hit me to the ground. This is the third time this has happened to me, Mr. Turner. I'm not going back down there. - I don't care if I say goodbye. - If you don't stop talking nonsense ... Go to my apartment and wait for me there. Yes sir. The poor woman suffers from hallucinations. He is always imagining that a large animal is crawling on the ground. - It's absurd, right? - A nonsense. Well, then we can go see our nest. Dear... It's downstairs. You are a box of surprises. Mr. Troy, your wife told me you are a novelist. - Strange. He has never told me. - Darling, I'm not telling you everything. - What kind of books do you write? - So far only mystery and crime. - Mystery and crime? - With the blood dripping and horrible things. But the next book is about Greenwich Village, a love story. Come on, dear. Here it is. Okay, from what I see. Imagine how it will turn out with our things. - I have it all planned ... - It will have to stay that way until there is light. - Very well. - I didn't tell you about the door. The lock will be fixed tomorrow. You will have to put something to secure it. - I'll find more candles. - Does not matter. We will go to eat out as soon as the furniture arrives and we will bring it ourselves. - Can I do something else? - Thanks, it's all. Goodnight. - I hope you have a good night. - Yes ... Yes... - You like? - It's great, wonderful, but ... - But what? - I have a strange feeling ... Jeff, Mr. Turner said that cleaner was a little ... Crazy. But it is not that. I have the feeling that I have already been here. Everything seems familiar to me. Those windows, that door, and the fireplace ... But how could you have been here? The house was empty ... ¡Jeff! - That thing! - What thing? The sliding monster is on my foot. Do not be silly. Come on, dear. I'll show you cooking. Here it is. Nice and neat, right? Friend. - Bathroom. - It looks good. And now the room. Imagine being awakened by sunlight every morning. And look ... here, take this. A garden behind the window, and in the center of New York. Go out to see it. Look, a fountain. I don't know how I have spent all these years without a source. Jeff! And we can put rose bushes in this part of here ... - How would I get in here? - That? - Horse. - What horse? - Here's a horseshoe. - Jeff, that brings luck. Close your eyes and make a wish. I wish my dear wife had not found this house. I wish my dear husband was n't so stupid. Hopefully it is impregnated with this wonderful atmosphere and write a best seller, in which no one is murdered. I wish my husband would do that again. - It goes, it goes. - Telegram for Mrs. Troy. - I'm Mr. Troy. - 65 cents. - Give it to me, I'll pay. - You have not paid the electricity bill. How nice ... Pay him, dear. - Keep the change. - Thank you. And, in the future, be more polite to the ladies. Whose is it? "Broken shaft in Eastport. Furniture late two hours. "Blue Van Express." - Great. Let's eat. How will we go? Our bags are there and the door won't close. We'll put them in that hallway. That door closes. - ¡Ann! - ¿Ann, qué? ¡Ann, espera! ¡Ann! - Hi there! - Nancy! - Where you come from? - And you? I haven't seen you for centuries. Two years went by. Let me see you. You look very pretty. - I'm so glad to see you. - I also. - Tell me, where were you? - Over there. And you? Over there. Ann, this is my husband Jeff Troy. This is Ann Stafford, dear. - Ann Carstairs. I also got married. - Congratulations to both of you. Carstairs ... Do I know him? What do you work on? Work in the Stock Exchange in the center. You don't know him but you should. Is incredible. - I'm sure if. - I'm amazing too. - Who asked you? And do you live here? - On the second floor. - Great! We also. - We moved to the basement. - To the basement? Why have you moved here? Did someone tell you? I'm in such a rush I don't even know what I'm saying. I have to go. I'm late. Do you want to have dinner with us tonight? I can not. We have already prepared dinner at home. Also, we are very busy. We go out very little. Well I ... See you later. I'm in a hurry. What strange behavior? - I was in a hurry. - And in the middle of a sentence. - Have you known her for a long time? -Yes. The first time I came to New York. We lived in the same neighborhood. Of course I hadn't seen her for a long time, but we were always good friends. - What did I say that changed your mind? - Any. That we move here. Come, let's eat. - Scott, I didn't say anything. - I know it darling. - But you reveal things without speaking. - She is an old friend. - Seriously, he's a good person. - We can't trust anyone. It is better to enter and not speak in the hallway. - I'll go upstairs to prepare food. - Darling, wait a minute. I think you get mad about nothing, Scott. They seem like a nice couple and not friendly to whisper. - What is he doing? - That's what I do not like. He is a novelist. Write about mystery and crime. - Keep writing. - As long as I don't solve them, Turner. - I'm not guilty of murder. - Nobody said you are. I don't understand how a novelist lives in such a decrepit place. - And why do we live here? - Will they be obligated like us? - Perhaps. - I don `t believe. - Do not distrust the haunted. - Ah, the haunted one. Sometimes I think it would be better to go to the police and tell the whole truth. - Easy, dear. - She always says that. - She's scared. - And one day he'll go to the police. And you'll be headless if you do n't stop messing with it. There is no use arguing. We have been together for 2 years, with loyalty. We have no secrets. The problems brought us closer. We are all in the same boat. The idea is to find a way to get out of this ship. Sorry. You're right, Lingle. Come on, dear. Let's go up. Look. "Polly's Stable". It seems like a good place to eat. With charm. - Your ticket. - Always the wrong hat. - For two? - Yes please. - How is the food? The best? - Of the best. Do you drink something? Two Old Fashioned cocktails. And then a dry toast. From rye to dry? Does not matter. It is to put it under the table. In such a place you have to keep a sense of humor. - Excuse me, where is the phone? - Under the stairs. - Who are you going to call? - To the laundry room, for the curtains. Hello George. Hello, Harry. Hello, drunk. - Hi, Polly. - Don't bite so much. - Hi, Polly. - Nice hat, princess. - Have a drink, Polly. - I don't drink, I've seen the light. - How are you, Polly? - Hi there. - Stranger around here, right? - Not much. I've been two minutes now. ¿Artist, sculptor, painter, writer? Tourist? - Just hungry. - Writer. Pauline ... what are you going to order? Our specialty is white fish. - They are two specialties, then. - Two? - My woman and I. - Woman... Sit down. She is telephoning. It will take an hour. Hi there? I want to talk to you now. You'll know what it's about when we talk. It doesn't matter where I am. Stay on Gay Street until I arrive. I'll be there in a few minutes. No, in your apartment, no. We'll see you in the basement. What happens? You are deaf? It was exactly what I wanted to say. The basement at 13 Gay Street. You have to be there. Jeff, when I was on the phone I heard ... - Sorry. - Darling, this is Polly. - Hello dear. - Hi, Polly. My name is Nancy. What did you say, Nancy? What did you hear on the phone? Do you see that man over there? That stop at the bar? I heard him in the next booth and he was threatening someone. - Who? Did you say names? - No. Not even yours. If you were to your things, you wouldn't hear it. But he told someone else that they would meet at our house. They couldn't be found in a cabin. Nothing more natural ... - Did you say "in our house"? - Yes darling. - You must have heard wrong. - No. I heard him clearly say 13 Gay Street, basement. - That? No. 13, Gay Street? -Yes. - Are you surprised? - I live there. - I have an apartment on the second floor. - Then we are neighbors. - We rented the basement. - Great. We will see each other a lot. I have to work. As for that guy, do n't worry. He comes around a lot, and he always drinks too much. Take advantage. I'll be back later with baking soda. Jeff, I'm scared. Okay, I'll go see what happens. - Will you go there? - Of course. After finishing the glass. Martin... I need to get out. Take care of everything until I get back. You've already drunk. Yes. I'm going there. It is OK darling. Sit down. You can drink this. Jeff ... don't do anything crazy. Do not be silly. I've always been crazy. Hi friend. Hi. I guess you don't remember me. We met two weeks ago. - Remember? How is it? - Get out of here. Do not know him. Who is pushing? It was what I imagined. - I'd swear you gave this address. - It's nonsense. Jeff ... the candle. You left it on, right? - It would go out. - The draft ... Sure. We should have bought candles and we forgot. That Turner said he'd give them to us . I'll call him to see if ... - What happens? - Hears. Do you hear that noise? What a noise? I hear nothing. Are you imagining ... Shut up. Do you hear it now? - It looks like water. -Yes. Wait. Taking. You see? I told you it looked like water. - Know that means? - They didn't cut the water. - The fire law prohibits it. - I wasn't talking about that, you idiot. - Who filled the bathtub? - Who filled the bathtub? That man from the restaurant has been here. That is crazy. Why would you want to fill the tub? Maybe he wanted to wipe off the blood after the beating you gave him. Honey, excuse me. I thought you were making fun of me. - Of course not. - I didn't want to hurt you. Today everything has gone wrong. No furniture, no light ... Strange things happen ... I know you're scared, but you don't need to tease. - But ... - My finger! - Have you hurt yourself, darling? - No. I'm playing storks. Look. It is our amulet. Wait. I remember perfectly having left it on the window. - Yes. How come ... - That's what I'd like to know. How did it come to be here? Honey, there is nothing strange about it. Of course, if we put together the strange things that have happened. The candle was out, the bathtub full of water, and now this. - I'll give you the solution for everything. - Yes? Sure. The guy from the restaurant has come for a bath. - Yes ... - He's very shy, so he blew out the candle and bathed in the dark. Then he saw that there were no towels and took the shoe. Surprising. I'll go out shopping for candles before the furniture arrives. - Bring that light up here. - I don't know if I should. - Come on. - It's okay. She is stuck. Wait. I'll turn the key and you push. Ready? Now. Honey, pull harder. - The key is crooked. - Not going well. You see? Wait... What's going on? Let's get out of here! We should find out what happens. - You are not afraid? - 15 minutes ago, yes. Now I am petrified. Stay near the door. If you hear something strange, run away. And leave the door open for me. - Look, it's a turtle. - A turtle? Maybe you put the candle on the shell. Come here. Snails! Honey ... it's the monster that haunts the cleaner's feet. - That's. - It has initials on the shell. B.P., M.W., L.B., J.T... Son mis iniciales. Do you remember I told you this place seemed familiar to me? And it is. It used to be an illegal bar. It was Joe's bar. This is old Hickory. It was the mascot here. The initials on the shell were the honor roll. Poop New Years Eve had a drinking contest and the last man standing stood tall on the honor roll. - Honey, did you only do it once? - I only participated once. It was the good old days ... Come on, Hickory, I'm going to put you to bed. - Jeff, where does she sleep? - Sleep in the garden fountain. A turtle ... who would say? Jeff... Jeff. What happens? - Who's there? - It's me. - It's the landlord. - Mr. Turner, what a joy to see you. The cleaner found this old lamp . It will be useful to you. Thank you. It is what we need. How did you get through this door? I tried it five minutes ago. - I turned the pin. - How weird. - Good evening again. - Goodnight. Finally we arrived. At last there are the moving men . - Excuse the delay, Mrs. Troy. - Does not matter. A few more hours and the furniture would be antiques. Good thing they have already arrived. - Shouldn't they bring them here? - Sure, Mrs. Troy. - The lady is in charge. - Thank you. - Chuck, let's go. - It's okay. - Thank you. - Is nothing. Boss, it's windy. It seems like it's going to rain. - We don't work in the rain ... - Where do you want this, Mrs. Troy? - Anywhere. - Then you will have to move it. - Mr. Troy is strong as a bull. - Put it there for now. - Leave it there. - Doesn't it help? Sure you do, but only heavy stuff . Quick, Chuck. This time it has stalled. This is the latest, Mrs. Troy. Where do you want it? To the bedroom, Pat. Come on, I'll show you. It has a lot of things ... Put it here. Very well. Can't we do anything else for you, Mrs. Troy? Thanks, Pat. They have done a lot for one day. Mrs. Troy, we can't accept it. - Speak for yourself. - It was my pleasure, Mrs. Troy. - A great pleasure. - Thanks, Pat. He is very friendly. - Well, good night. - Goodnight. Goodnight. Isn't he a very strong man? A big healthy boy. Mrs. Troy, you wanted to make me jealous all night. Is not sufficient? - Why, Mr. Troy? - I'll go to bed. Your pajamas are out in the hall, in a suitcase. I've broken my nose! Honey, what ... Honey, I'm sorry. Poor. Jeff, that's it. Let me see. It's broken? Come out. - Who are they? What do they want? - Where is? What where ...? Jeff? I do not know. You are still out absorbing vitamin D. Why don't you sleep in like the others? What's going on? You have no right to enter here this way. My husband takes care of this. Jeff? - Better not go out, ma'am. - What's going on? We have been informed that someone was sunbathing on the patio. Heavens! He's sleepwalking again. He is not standing, he is lying down. I'll call the police station. Wake him up, Mr. Agent. Wake it up. ¿Jeff? It's too late. Is dead. - What is he doing here? - And you? I went out to buy. I live here. - What happens? - There is a body in the yard. - A corpse ... what? - Yes, a dead person. But ... she ... Nancy! ¿Nancy? How? Where? Why? Jeff... Sweetie! Are you not dead? I think not. You neither? Nancy dear! Jeff... Someone has died. Someone has died ... The man from the restaurant. And... Sweetie! Why are you looking at me like that? - What do you think, Inspector? - I have just arrived. Where is? - In the basement. - Are there clues, Bolling? A full hat. There are the men with the stretcher. That's who is dead. Get out of the window, Polly. They will see you. And why not? There is a lot of agitation on the street. She looks through the window. It's natural. You're right. We don't behave naturally. All together in the same room full of fear. - I'll go down and see what happens. - Scott! It's not natural to whisper either, Scott. You may be right, Lingle. But they will come here to ask. And the first person they will approach is ... - The person in charge of the building. - I can not go there. - They know me. - You don't need to introduce yourself. - It's not funny, Miss Franklin. - Is someone laughing? Seriously, Turner. Go home. They will look for you and find you there. - And what do I tell them? - Any. If he had a chance to hand us over, he would do so without hesitation. No problem. He's so scared it's not even worth it. Come on, honey. We go to our quiet house. Like I said, it doesn't make sense for us to be together as if the crime was ours. - But it must have been one of us. - Do not you think? - Whoever it was, I appreciate it. - You really hadn't seen it? - Never. - Before yesterday, no. - I get it. And are you sure you overheard him talking to someone in this building on the phone? - Yes. - So the killer lives here. I wouldn't rush to say so, Mr. Troy. - After all, you live here. - And he admits that he had a fight with him. It was not a fight. It was only two hits. He hit my husband, and my husband hit the ground. - Come on, I hit him too. - Very little. You didn't kill him. Of course not. Bolling, find the building manager . Look with him. Muscles try to open that door. There must be a trick. But if it's little Eddie Turner. - Hi, Bolling. - Come to the living room. Inspector, look what I found on the stairs. Hi, Turner. Still in the old bar ... - I am the owner of the building. - I'm not surprised. At the prices you and Joe charged for illegal gin. Was he Joe's partner? Until a certain point. Right, Turner? Then one day Joe disappeared. Right, Turner? I don't know what happened to him. We never had a problem. - We were doing well. - You were doing fine. There's a guy in the yard who ca n't tell who he is, maybe you can. Jeff, stay out of it. It's none of your business. I will not get involved. I'm just going to see. What have you discovered, Doc? The blow to the head did not cause death. We'll find out at the autopsy. - Come here. - Let's go. Look. Come on, look at it. - Do you know him? - Yes. It's Louis Kaufman. - How long has it been? - Three months. - Did you know him a lot? - We were just saying hello. - Do you know where he lived? - No. I never asked him. - I knew him recently. - Where? Here in the building ... Hankins, I don't know anything. - Where, in the building? - He and I... Stop stuttering and speak. He came here three months ago to rent a house. - Did you rent it to him? - In the third floor. You told me you didn't know where he lived. I thought ... I was confused. I thought it was before he came. - And he didn't stay long. - Let's go up to see his house. - Sorry. - Nothing happens. Inspector, if you lived on the third floor, Why was he an appointment at our house? Maybe he didn't say to meet at his house. But he forgets that my wife told him who heard me make the appointment on the phone. I don't forget what his wife told me . Wait .. Are you implying that I ...? Mr. Detective, do you think the inspector will object to your frying eggs? - I'm starving. - It can go. - Thank you. - If you fry them without breaking them, I was taking a photo to show my wife that it is possible. I wish my husband would say that. If I am a suspect, I have the right to be heard. All right, what do you mean? First of all, it seems to me that you are totally wrong. I am sorry to hear that. Inspector, let me take this guy to the police station to speak quietly. - Leave it. - Take me to the police station ... Are you threatening me with an interrogation? I tell him that the police can't use wet towels to hit these days. - No? - No towels. Go on, Mr. Troy. You said I'm wrong. - Do you want some eggs and ham? - Wait a minute. First, you have no reason to think that my wife is lying. - Who said it? - Yes, his wife is telling the truth. - What do we do now? - Find out with whom the dead man spoke, question the people in the building. - Thank you very much. Would you mind if I took a look at the deceased's apartment? You can go, but it's a waste of time. You won't find anything there. Come on, let's have breakfast. Look at "Homicide in the Laundry Room." "Homicide in the Post Office". "Homicide in the Port". "Homicide at the Chinese Restaurant". Someone has been reading about murders. "Homicide in the Laundry Room" ... by Jeffrey Yort. He said he was a novelist. Maybe... I have written them. See ... Jeffrey Yort, it 's my name backwards. Troy. Yort. Yort. Troy. Sees it? What else do we need? This guy has murder on his brain. Homicide in the brain ... Excellent title! Didn't he write a book called "Murder in the Garden"? Is here. Likes? I remember that it is the kind of story that can be "tied" well. Tie? I know what she means. It is all well linked. The clues in the right place. No. I say it is "tie". A-t-a-r. Spell it backwards. A-t-a-r. R-a-t-a... Whoa ... Miara as is ... Empty. - You don't seem surprised, Turner. - I am, yes. You're not going to tell us that the house was furnished. - It had furniture. - When? The last time I was here, two days ago. Did he remove all the furniture without your knowledge? I was at the bank yesterday. - It could have been at that time. - I said there would be nothing here. Lárguese! - What kind of furniture did he have? - Normal. I did not notice. - What color were the curtains? - I honestly don't remember. You have the same memory as when your partner Joe disappeared. No... Come on, get out now. - I haven't done anything, seriously. - Who is this? Mrs. Salter, the cleaner. Seriously, Mr. Turner. I know nothing. - Of what? - Of the disappearance, and the rest. Why do you say "the rest"? I saw the police coming through the front windows that's why I've come here to look through the back windows, and I saw that the furniture had disappeared. Of course I got nervous because I was here last night and I heard someone coming. - Then I hid in the closet. - Why there? I've already told you. I saw the police coming through the front windows that's why I've come here to look through the back windows, and I saw that the furniture had disappeared. Of course I got nervous because I was here last night and I heard someone coming. and I hid in the closet. - Did you hear me and hide? - Why? - Inspector ... I know why he hid. Sure. Saw the police coming through the front windows that's why he came here to look through the back windows, and saw that the furniture had disappeared. Of course she got nervous because he was here last night and he heard someone coming. and hid in the closet. I should be the detective. Hi. Very hectic day. Hi. Hi. Very hectic day. Yes. I was watching it from my window. Yes? - It smells like coffee? - If he likes it? I love. I would like very much. Come in and have a cup. - A very cozy house. - Thank you. - As you like? - Alone, please. Sugarfree. Thank you. Shall I keep your mug? Nothing happens. I'll find another. - This coffee is overheated. - Yes. How do you know? You would have to heat it twice to make it so hot. - It is a very cozy house. - You already said it. Oh yeah. - A nice boy. - He's my son. - He's in a school up north. - And his father? As far away as possible. I'm divorced. Do you know that the man they murdered was the one in the restaurant? - Yes ... - Why didn't you say you lived here? Do not use the napkin. I'll find a towel. Mr. Andrew Bruhl New York - This letter is mine. - Yes ... it's already drying. - Give it to me. I'll take it to the mailbox. - I will do. There is one downstairs. - Mr. Troy, please. - I'll kick her out. I bet it's for her boyfriend. Excuse me, I forgot to knock on the door. It's okay, dear. We were just playing. - With the letter. - Yes ... Ya ... when you finish playing cards, breakfast is waiting for you. Or maybe not. Nancy, honey, wait. I think Polly thought you were jealous. - Get your hands off me, wolf. - Nancy, are you jealous? Of course not! - Let me. - You are jealous. - I'm not, and don't talk to me. - What if I did the same to you? - You never have? - Of course not. It's for kids. And the moving man last night. Weren't you jealous? - No. - I wasn't, no, no ... - You almost killed him. - Don't be crazy. Crazy things? You should have stayed upstairs instead of coming ... - Do you see what you have done? - I? By saying that he almost killed him and with a corpse in the courtyard. Matt, take two men and investigate the other people in the building and go back to the police station. We found something, boss. They hit the guy with a horseshoe. It has blood, and the hairs are from the stiff. - Fingerprints? - Enough. - Those of a man predominate. - I bet they're from Troy. - How ugly ... - It's mine. - Yes? - It's our amulet. - Not for another guy. - What does it mean? I do not understand. - Where did you find her, Curly? - Hidden behind the chair. It would fall. It was at the window. - Yes? - Yes, I found her in the yard. Wait. They think this is what the killer used to ... Hot, almost burned. Go get your hat. - That? - Go get your hat! - Let's go. - But... It's 30 tonight. - Who? - The electrician. And how can I know? What how ...? Turn on the switch. There is already light. I don't need an electrician. Ma'am, I was the one who fixed it. Open the door. - Why should I open it? - Does not sign through wood. It's okay. - It is done. - Thank you. On the bottom line. It looks the same. Nothing has changed. The things they sold here left us even without ... see. - And they called me Melenas. - Also made the honor roll? - In the turtle? No. - My husband does. Seriously? Then hold it. Can I use that door? - Why? - Just out of nostalgia, ma'am. ¿Nancy? No Please! Leave it, please! Wait, Charlie. Wait. There is someone downstairs. Bet yes. What are you doing there? Hanging the clothes. What do you think? - Help me out. - Exit the way you entered. - I can not. The door is closed. - I'll turn around and open it for you. Nancy, the killer is back. My dear, where are you? - It is done. - Already what? Why have you closed it again? Open up! Open the door! Please! Jeff! Hi dear. Your makeup has run off. - Nice. - Angelita ... - Love, why are you angry? - Go away. Nancy ... hey, my love. Don't you want to know how it went at the police station? - The interrogation? - After bath. - But I have not eaten. - That? - I'm hungry. - Eat some cookies. - It's okay. - Don't annoy your appetite. I have a roast ready for the oven. Here it is. Okay... Now ... pepper and salt. 100... 250. Now ... potatoes ... - What do you do? - Any. - You are very calm. - Because I'm not doing anything. Stop joking, and tell me what happened. I just wanted to surprise you and I was not used to baking. No ... what happened at the police station? Ah, that ... They asked me a lot of questions. First, they thought the guy had died of a blow to the head, but with the autopsy they discovered that he had been drowned. Drowned? Do you remember the water running in the bathtub last night? - I'll go get more coffee, go on. - I told him there. Whoever killed him knocked him unconscious in the bathtub ... What happens? What's going on? I bathed there. - Why didn't you stop me? - You were dirty, honey. Jeff ... this is a horrible place. - Let's get out of here. - Leave? Love, don't talk nonsense. - And your great idea? - What idea? "Jeff, if you want to write about Greenwich Village, you have to live "and meet the people there." - You don't know anybody. - Only police and corpses. - Nancy, don't you understand? It is a great opportunity. I have come to write a story and I have one. - But it's not love. But you love me ... I love you, right? - What does that have to do with this? - It's our love story. Two people very much in love in the middle of a homicide. - I do not like. - But darling, look ... I have never written anything successful. Because you only write about mystery and crime. Nerd. It is because they are bad mysteries and crimes. This time, I have a serious plot. I will find out who killed the man and then I write the novel. Think of advertising. Jeff, it's not worth it. This place terrifies me. I feel like someone is watching me . That is nonsense. How? - You feel it? -Yes. It's strange. I also feel like ... As if someone was watching me . Let's go upstairs to see if Turner has curtains. - I feel like a dancer. - How do you know? I feel like a naked dancer . Cold. Do you get it? - Yes, I understand. - Seriously? Goodbye. Be patient. It will get open. Excuse me. I hope I didn't scare you. Frighten? Of course not. I was cleaning the gun and accidentally went off. Mrs. Salter was shocked. - I think so. - We wanted to ask ... - Come in. - Thank you. Could you get us some curtains? The neighbors are spying on us. Sorry. I ordered them, but they still haven't arrived. - And that coverlet? - Great for the door. - Now for the windows ... - Something temporary ... Wonderful, huh, darling? I was just looking. Not an ordinary screen, right? A tenant left it to me some time ago. - It will be useful if you want to take it. - Thanks, we took it. Honey, wasn't the idea that the neighbors didn't watch us? The photographs would be at home. - Sorry. - Sorry... Mrs. Troy, this is Mr. Lingle from the apartment down the hall. - This is my husband. - He wants help? - It's not necesary. I can. - Good evening, Mr. Turner. Thank you. - Stupid. - What have I done? - The screen was upstairs. - Nothing happens. - I said I had it for a long time. - Did you give him the address? - What direction? - De Bruhl. 507 West, 12th Street. - It was on the screen. - Why didn't you say it? I saw it when it was taken away. Wait. Where are you going? To recover the screen. I will say that I changed my mind. No. You have no ideas. ¡Jeff! ¡Jeff! Already. Do you want a glass of water. Look. - What do you do? - Any. - It's old Hickory. - That turtle ... - Why did you let her pass? - I'd walk in the door. - Goodnight. - Goodnight Sweetheart. Jeff... - What happens now? - Jeff ... Is there someone at home. I hear his footsteps. Tell him to sit down and calm down. Do you hear I wish I didn't hear. Do not go. They could hurt you. No ... You've only taken three lessons. - Wait here. - No. I'm going with you. - That's how they'll kill us both. - Stop talking about murder. Better to quit. There is no escape. - Jeff, are you hurt? - I think not. Turn on the light. It's okay. I'll quit fencing. Look... A razor ... That scraping noise. - Maybe you wanted a photo? - I hope not. Let's see ... Look. Here's something. - It looks shaved. - 07 West 12th Street ... - It looks like the top of 5. - It is. 507 West 12th Street ... That address sounds familiar to me. Where ... I know! Polly's boyfriend. - It was the address on the letter. - When you were playing postmen ... That's. And the name was Andrew Bruhl. Whoever it was, he didn't want us to see that direction. Call a cab, honey. I'm going to get dressed. - Jeff, it's after one. - If Mr. Bruhl was respectable, He'll be sleeping at home and I'll wake him up. So, let's go. - You stay, dear. - Okay, but be careful. Is your boyfriend looking for trouble? - No. Why do you say so? - I dont know. Maybe that house looks like a place where there are problems. Dis... Disparates. - Goodnight. - What hours. Yes, sorry to bother you, but it is urgent that you speak to Mr. Bruhl. I thought so. They've been asking about Mr. Bruhl for months . But the others, at least, had the decency to come during the day. - I can talk with him? - No, because he doesn't live here and has never lived. - Then why... Goodnight. Old chocha. - What did you say? - That Bruhl doesn't live there, but he's lying. Don't tell me you're going to write about crime at this hour? I will write to Mr. Andrew Bruhl at 507 West, 12th Street. Tomorrow morning, I'll see if it delivers or not. Funny ... I'll also be at 507 West, 12th Street. - Here it comes. - At last. Mr. Postman, don't you have mail for me? Andrew Bruhl from 507. - Bruhl ... no. - But.... - A white envelope, like this. - Sorry. Have they moved now? - No. He's already given me many letters. - No. - Of course. - Hey, I've been here for a year And I'm sure I never saw his name - Maybe I'm wrong. - Perhaps. You see ... I write a letter and it is not delivered. Look in the pockets. Maybe you forgot to put it in the mailbox. Bah. You have seen how I have thrown her out. It is true. Let's go to the post office to see what happens. Come on ... My angel, it's not your idea. - He is very intelligent. - I'll be one or the other. His name is Andrew Bruhl and he lives at 507 West, 12th Street. - And you don't get mail? - Exactly. I get it. He moved. He now lives at 143 Tilton Place. I'll see if the postman is alerted. - 143 Tilton Place. - That's. - Exactly. Now he lives ... - I know. - Give me three 1-cent stamps. - In the window next door. 143, Tilton Place. It's here. So, let's go. Do you have any idea what you are going to do? What are you going to say? Call me Eddie. - What do you want? - Is Mr. Bruhl here? No. Who are you? - My name is Edward Turner. - Come in. Thanks Edward. Thank you. I don't know when Mr. Bruhl will arrive, but if you want to leave a message ... - If you don't mind, we'll wait. - If they want it. - Come in. - Thank you. - Is it Mrs. Bruhl? - No. I'm Mrs. Devoe. - Sit down. - Thank you. This is my home. I rent an apartment to Mr. Bruhl. I get it. I know it's none of my business, but it's silly to wait. Sometimes it doesn't show up for days. He doesn't always live here. Sometimes I even wonder if he lives. - Go in and out to check the mail. - I get it... That's why he knew I knew him. Mrs. Devoe will have seen my name on the letters, darling. - Edward Turner. - I see him on Saturdays. I don't know what it's about. In the end, it's none of my business. And do you get a letter from Miss Polly Franklin every week ? - Polly Stable? - Punctual as clockwork. And from someone named Lingle. I suppose they will. Still getting mail from Scott Carstairs? - And Louis Kaufman? - Kaufman ... I don't remember any Kaufmans. They seem to know more than I do. Why are you asking me these questions? Okay... We are interested in who does business with Mr. Bruhl. I understand ... Answer me a question. What kind of business? I've seen him get money from those letters. Always in cash, never by check. - It's not illegal, is it? - It's perfectly legitimate. Live in my house. I don't want to get into trouble for him. - Clear. - Mrs. Devoe ... ... tell me what I want to know and I will tell you what you need. - What is Mr. Bruhl like? - Have you never seen it? Our deal was done by correspondence. I understand ... He's not exactly my type. He is tall and fat and almost always smells of alcohol. It is unpleasant. - Kaufman. - Who is Kaufman? A friend of ours who looks like your description. - Blond? - No. He has dark hair. - He doesn't look like Kaufman. - Of course not. - Was that what they wanted to know? - I think so. My dear, as Mrs. Devoe says Mr. Bruhl hasn't shown up for days, we must not bother her anymore. - Goodbye. You see? Kaufman and Bruhl are the same person. - Perhaps. - Perhaps? You haven't heard her describe Kaufman and saying she's Bruhl And 13 Gay Street sends him money. - Blackmail. - One of them killed the blackmailer and the others help him hide the murderer. But isn't it strange that they all live in the same building? And I know why. He has made them live there to control them. - Yes maybe. - Maybe? Can't you see it? He walked into their circle as Kaufman and blackmailed them as Bruhl. Someone found out and killed him. Simple. - Too. - What's the problem, Mrs. Sherlock? First, Ms. Devoe was very well dressed for those who have to rent a house to get money. And that pearl on her finger ... So heavy she doesn't even lift her hand. - Where do you want to go? - Mrs. Devoe is not who she says she is. - He speaks too much. - With the information you gave me? Because the killer wanted you to have her, he wanted you to know her. If you asked him unexpected questions ... Something that she would not have anticipated. - Wait. - It's okay. I forgot something. I sent a letter to Mr. Bruhl yesterday. - Can you give it back to me? - I'm sorry, but no. - I wait for him, and he will return it to me. - He came at noon and took her away. Have you come? I get it. Thank you. Hi there? Yes, it has been here. Yes, the girl was with him. He swallowed it all. Do not worry. He is proud to get so much out of me. - And good? - You were right, dear. He said they took the letter. Kaufman didn't come out of the morgue ... So Bruhl, the blackmailer and the killer are still alive. - Jeff, I'm scared. - Cab. - Where we go? - To the police station. - Well. - Cab. I do not understand something. You asked me to describe Kaufman. You could recognize Kaufman and he will speak ... Dead? Kaufman is dead? Wait. I don't want to be involved in a homicide for you or anyone. Yes I am. I'm already engaged. He asked me about the letter again. What did I tell him? That Kaufman came for her today. Yes, I know I was wrong, but you didn't tell me about Kaufman. Look, we're going to get out of town. Taxi. Taxi. Taxi. Here, ma'am. - No. - Yes. I don't know what happens. I know nothing. Nobody ever knows anything. Let's go. And that's it. But it proves that a man named Bruhl was the murderer. And that he is living in that house under a false name. So he sums it all up to a letter full of names and we just have to find out who Bruhl is. I will if you help me. Very well. What do you want me to do? When the police work on a homicide, they investigate the victim. It is our method. Maybe a little dated, but sometimes it works. Very well. What have you discovered about Kaufman? He got out of jail a month ago. He served 6 years for forgery. Before that, he was a private investigator for the Bruhl Detective Agency. - Bruhl Detective Agency? - Don't you see it? Everything connects. Bruhl got the information out of there and blackmailed them. Kauffman found out what he was doing and wanted a part, then Bruhl eliminated it. Why do you think Bruhl is a man? It can be a woman. If it is male or female, I will find out. Come on, dear. If it were you, you would arrest Ms. Devoe and question her. An excellent suggestion. Just common sense. Send two cops to stop her, and fast. Bolling and Mathews to get Devoe, and quick. - Thanks for the suggestion. - No problem. Goodbye. Is it fast enough? C'mon darling. Goodbye, inspector. - He must have had Mrs. Devoe already. - Sure... ¡Nancy! - Anne, what is it? - I thought you weren't coming. - I've been waiting for you for a long time. - How did you get in? The cleaner left me. It had to come. I'm going crazy. - You have to help me, Nancy. - Sure. What are you afraid of? What question! You know what. Of the same as the others. She is afraid that the reason Bruhl blackmails her will come out. Bruhl ... blackmail ... I don't know what you're talking about. You don't need to pretend. Everybody in this building knows about Bruhl. He took money from us all. Happily, he's dead. Did he also force you to come? Come on, dear. Sit down. Sit down. - We're all in the same boat. - In the same boat ... I've heard that for a year. It was already terrible when Scott and I were deprived to pay that horrible person. First, when I knew he was dead, I was glad. Later, I realized that one of us killed him. I don't trust anyone and I want to talk, I want ... I have to shut up ... - Anne, you need a drink. - And me. Tell me, Anne, how did you discover that Bruhl and Kaufman were the same person? We all suspected, and when we found out he was dead, Scott and Turner searched their home. They found letters, documents ... I don't know what else. I understand ... Who found out he was dead? - I do not know. - Of course you know. - It was your husband, right? - No! Scott has nothing to do with it. I found out. - Your? - I went down to see Nancy. I had to talk to someone. Nancy was an old friend. There was no one. I thought they were in the garden. - I told the others. - That was a mistake. I know. From the beginning, I have only made mistakes. I must have turned myself in to the police from the beginning. He was innocent. Of what? It was so long ago that it seems unreal. - Do you remember Robert Higby? - Higby? The Playboy Homicide Case? He was stitched up at his home. I was at home. The shot came from the window. I was scared and ran away. I remember reading that in the newspaper. Were you the mysterious redhead? Stupid redhead. After everything calmed down, I thought nothing would happen. I met Scott. After we got married ... Bruhl began to blackmail. I get it. This will help. Thanks sweetie. - What did you know about Lingle? - Lingle was an art dealer. He admits he forged a painting. The man who bought it put Bruhl on his trail. Bruhl betrayed his client and made Lingle pay ever since. - Do you believe the Lingle story? - I do not know what to believe. What do you think happened to the Kaufman furniture? We divide them between the floors. We thought that would prevent the police from discovering it was Bruhl. ¿Y Polly? I don't think a cheerful girl like Polly is involved. No I dont think so. You said happy, right? The only bad thing about Polly is that she is an incurable romantic. Wrote romantic letters and that man took them from her and threatened to give them to her ex-husband. She has a son... He was afraid that the father would take his son from him. I get it. And Turner? - Jeff, aren't you going to see what happened? - I do not need it. I know what happened. Someone has screamed. You see? What have i told you Come on, honey. Come on, Jeff. I think it came from the basement. Fast. C'mon darling. Let's go. Look... - What happens? - It's okay. Just a faint. - What scared you? - I know. That turtle. - Tortoise? - Here it is ... Hickory. Damn, do you like to scare people? - That thing! - Take it before I pass out. - I want to get out of here ... - Where did that come from? - It was our mascot in Prohibition. - There's your wife. ¡Anne! - What do you do? Haven't you gone out? - You came to visit us, right? - Then we heard a scream. - What are you doing here, Anne? - We were just chatting. - You spoke. About herself. I already knew something about the others. - Less of you. - I? What did Bruhl know ...? Yes, I said Bruhl. I know he was blackmailing them. - What did he have against you? - Why would I tell him? - To blackmail him? - He was blackmailed too. - He told me. - He pulled his tongue. - The left the cara. - Espere, Scott. - You have to grow up to talk like that. - He thinks he's very smart. - I know something you don't know. - It's just hearsay. - Then wait to hear it. - Yeah, wait, Scott. - Go ahead, talk. - Any. I just want to talk. - Wait. Get started. - It's okay. To begin with: I am not interested in your private life. Only by knowing her will I know who killed Kaufman. It was someone in this building and I almost know who it was. They believe they protect a benefactor. They think Kaufman was Bruhl. But I tell you that Bruhl is living in this building. - We have proof that Bruhl died. - What evidence? You see He wants to get more out of us . Come on, Anne. When it's all over, you'll hear from Mr. Bruhl again. Has a lot of information. Use it against my wife and you will see. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Fool! You told them that Bruhl is still alive. You pretended you knew who it was. Don't you know what he's going to do now? When we sleep, he will come down to eliminate me. - And I'll know who it is. - What a good idea, honey. When I come down to kill you, you'll find out who killed Kaufman. Then he kills you, because you know he killed Kaufman too. And since I will know that he has killed you, he will kill me. You're an Idiot! - Honey, you won't be here. - Why? - I have planned that you wait in a hotel. - Expect that? - An urn with your ashes? - Nancy ... For years I believed that I was married to a sensitive genius. Now I find out he's just a fool. - Wait. Is my sleepwear. - Luckily you haven't lost your sight. I stay. It is the great opportunity. The last chapter of the book. - Of your life. - Do not worry about me. Jeff, you idiot, you don't even have a gun. Neither is he. It makes a lot of noise. - Will he drown you in the bathtub? - No, he will not. - I can take care of myself. - Jeff, be sensible. Kaufman knocked you down and that guy killed Kaufman. - You don't have a chance. - Do you want a cowardly husband? I am not exquisite. I just want a husband. Well, I'll stay. I want to see this through to the end. It's OK darling. If you have decided, stay. - I'll stay too. - Honey, be sensible. Sensible people call the police. And take the laurels after my work? While we wait for the laurels, we better make the will. - Okay, you won. - Are you coming? Sweetie! - I will live to regret it. - But you will live. Help me with the suitcases. Thank you. - I forgot my typewriter and the books ... - Leave them, honey. Leave them? Are you sick. Help me, I have many books. - Wait honey. - Hurry up. - Hey, do you want to win $ 20? - Is it legal? Is it legal to take that lady to a hotel? - To his wife? - That's. My wife arrives on the midnight train . - Do you understand? - Perfectly. Put them here, Mr. Cabbie. It's okay. Come on, Jeff. - The sooner we get out ... - You can start, friend. Wait. Wait there! Jeff! You are a stupid! This will do. Hi Hickory. Sorry I didn't invite you to come in but I wait for company. If you hear something, bark. Who? ¿Jeff? ¡Jeff! ¡Nancy! - Honey, what a joy to see you. - What a joy. - What are you doing here? - Being with you, of course. I told the taxi driver to take you to the Shelby Hotel. He took me to the first light and then the police took him away. Did you report it? But darling don't you realize the consequences So will Hankins and the cops come. - Hope so. - You know to keep a secret? Things are not going to turn out the way I expected. - Honey, what happened to the light? - Someone removed the fuses. Come on, hurry up. Let's go. Wait. The police are coming, don't be afraid. If you gon 'sing honey, sing loud Watch out! ¡Jeff! Jeff, the police are here! Grab him. Grab? I can't get him to let go of me. Honey, are you ok? I've been so scared that he ... Jeff, honey ... Jeff ... Inspector, you went out there. - Take it, Mac. What about him? - I hit him with the chair. - I may gain common sense. - There is no chair that does that. Cover the emergency exit, Mac. Temple, the alley. Simmon ... Whitney, the roof. - Were the doors open, Math? -Yes. Nice place to keep a fuse. - C'mon darling. - Has run away? - The police will take it. - Who was? I don't see his face. Don't try to get up just yet. Why? Aren't the police here? How did he hit me from behind if he was in front? When it's all over, I'll explain. - A trick ... - Get up. - It is done. - Why didn't I use the golf club? - I also wonder the same. - What was that? The light. The police would connect her. - Yes, the police. Where are they? - In the room, I guess. Fletcher and Weaver are checking the house next door. - Can I help, Inspector? - From now on I say no. I've caught it! I've caught it! ¡Jeff! Here, inspector. - Who was? Where is? - I think I spoke too soon. What were you trying to do, kill all the police? - I saw something move, and I fired. - What was it? - You won't believe it. - That? It's old Hickory. Since when are you on the case? Didn't you think there would be something behind the wall? - Yes sir. No sir. - Yes there is. It's a room and we are here! We have combed the area. Whoever it was has escaped. - Without anyone seeing it? - Maybe he's still here. Waiting to play hide and seek. - It seems quite logical to me. - All right, Mr. Crime Expert, Why did you leave the doors open? For the air to enter? This one is easy. So they think it came out there. Instead, he hid in the room. - Like the murderer in one of his books. - It's possible. - Possible? - It's possible. There is room to hide under the bed or in a closet. What happens? - A shot to the heart. - The shot came from behind. Through the back wall? So I have captured it. - Big deduction, Bolling. - Thank you. Call a squad car. It's Lingle. Baby do you remember that ... It is very sensitive. He is, and that's why I love him. Jeff, get up. Get up. It's your good suit. Darling come on Let's go. It will be fine. * battalions * July 2009
