[footsteps approaching] - [girl] Can I open my eyes now? - [man] Not yet. We're almost there. [girl] Where are we? [man] Just a second. You'll see. [man] Okay. Open them. Ta-da! [bright instrumental music playing] [softly] Wow. You must have really missed it. You're skating with me. - Oh no, no, no, no. No, no, no. - Oh yes. - Yeah. You have to. Come on. - Anna. No. - [man panting] - [Anna giggling] - [necklace jingling] - [man chuckles] Anna, wait. [grunts] [groaning] [both chuckle] - Don't laugh. - Dad, come on. Relax, okay? You've gotta bend your knees a little. Hang on. I'm not the pro here. You are. I just paid for the lessons. - Yay! - [Anna laughing] You're gonna get dizzy, you show-off. [loud banging in distance] [clattering continues] [father panting, whispering] The backpack. And goggles. Time to go. [both panting] [rustling in distance] [low metallic whining] [tense, rhythmic music playing] - [loud thwack] - [groans] [sticks tapping] - [woman grunts] - [father moans] [father and woman straining] I don't need to see you to beat your face in. Hand it over. - Give it to me! - [father groans] - [exhales heavily] - [thief 1] Let's go. - [cans clattering] - [thief 1] Let's go. [thief 2] Hurry up! [thieves chattering indistinctly] - You missed one. - [woman] I got it. [thief 2] Let's go. [father moans] [birds singing outside] [father] Thank you. [Anna] For what? [father] For not letting me hurt them. They were just hungry. You ready? Ready. [father exhales] [static crackles] [woman 1 on radio] ...an alarming spread of incidents into Europe and Siberia. [man 1] We don't yet know what is causing the mass suicides in Europe... [woman 2] We urge the population to shelter in place. All we know about these beings is that direct visual contact leads to suicide. [man 2 speaking French] [woman 3] Everyone should wear blindfolds or blackout goggles when going outside. Use any means necessary to cover your eyes and avoid visual contact with these beings. [man 3] You see one of these things, you're fucked. You'll blow your brains out before you know it. Not much more I can tell you other than be safe and good luck. [static crackles] [crows cawing in distance] [birdsong in plaza] [metallic creaking] [flock of birds calling] [nearby clattering] [wheels squeaking] [softly] You know what to do. Only come out when you call me. [father] I have to make sure they're good people. [shouting] Hello? [sighs] Is anyone there? Hello? [man 1] Who's there? [Sebastián] My name is Sebastián. I'm injured. I haven't eaten in a few days. We can't help you. I'm really sorry. I went out looking for food, but now I can't find my way back home. - [man 1 sighs] - [man 2] Marcial. - What do we do? - Let's listen to him. Fucking go. We gotta get going. I'm sorry. I know where to find a generator! - A generator? - [Sebastián] I worked in construction. Before this happened. As an engineer. My company... I know where they stored the generators. They're too heavy to carry by myself, but with your help... [Marcial] Hmm. [Sebastián] I think we could all use a little... light. - Indoor heating. - [woman] Marcial, we need it. - Come on. - I don't trust him. [Sebastián] Don't you agree? [quietly] Marcial. Are you alone? Yes. [ethereal whispers reverberating] [whispers intensifying] [woman] They're coming. Let's go. Let's go! [Marcial] Sebastián, grab onto the rope. [woman] Come on! Open up! It's Marcial! [lock clicks] [Marcial] Get in! Close the door. [Sebastián exhales] [woman inhales sharply, sighs] CLOSE ONE DOOR BEFORE OPENING ANOTHER ALWAYS USE YOUR BLINDFOLD [woman 2] Who's that? He was lost. Says he knows where to find a generator. [indistinct chatter in distance] [hammer clanging] Jesus. You weren't kidding. What happened to you? You look like a boxer. No, more like a punching bag. [chuckles] This way. Let the doctor take a look at you. - You have a doctor? - Sure. We have a doctor, we have a carpenter, a mechanic. Hey, you don't know how to cook, do you? The guy we have right now, he must've learned how to cook in jail. [Sebastián laughs] [Marcial] Doctor? Doctor. Marcial. Call me Liliana, please. I've got a patient for you. Needs some help with his face. - [groans] - Does it hurt? Only when I breathe. [both chuckle] Well, your nose isn't broken. So that's good news. You need stitches on your eyebrow. So tell me... who did this to you? Blind people. Well, out there, we're all blind. [groans] I wasn't outside. - This happened indoors? - Yes. - No blindfold? - Yes. - They managed to... - Um... - Uh-huh. - It was three against one. - It was pretty dark. - [chuckles, sighs] Do me a favor. [whispers] Don't tell the others what happened. [softly] It'll be our little secret. I'll tell you mine. I actually used to be a dentist. - [Sebastián scoffs, inhales sharply] - Breathe. [group chatting indistinctly in distance] [Liliana] Well, you must be starving. Go on. Help yourself. - Thank you. - Here. - You're staring. - [conversations fade] Excuse me? You're staring. I'm sorry. I could wear a blindfold or sunglasses if I wanted. But I want others to see me... and realize. Realize what? That there are worse things than the creatures. Worse? Most people kill themselves when they see them. But it's not everybody. At first, we thought they wanted our food. But they weren't wearing blindfolds. They came from the outside with their eyes wide open. These people saw the creatures. It was almost like something in them was rotten. - [lighter clicks] - Inside here. And now they wanted us to see. They wanted the whole world to see. Rosa was the first one they got ahold of. One of them, their leader... he smudged his thumb on charred wood. And he drew an eye on her forehead with the ashes. Then they dragged her outside. Against her will. [Rosa sobbing] No! I couldn't see her, but I could hear her. Screaming. [Rosa cries out] [man] I still do. I noticed a knife sitting on the table. Someone left it there during the struggle. I knew I had to be quick about it. They could stop me if I waited. I grabbed the knife as fast as I could. I was fast. After that, they lost interest. And I couldn't see anymore. [Liliana] When we found him, he was wandering in the streets, lost. [soft snoring] [distant birdsong] [keys jangling] [Sebastián breathing shakily] [whispering] Don't worry. - They'll all be free soon. - Sebastián? [Sebastián] I promise. It's almost done. [Liliana exhales] - [keys clattering] - [Sebastián mutters] Don't worry. Sebastián, what are you doing? Sebastián? [Sebastián panting] [Liliana] Hey, Sebastián! No. No, no, no. No, Sebastián. - Sebastián, stop! Help me! - [Marcial] What's going on? - [Liliana] Sebastián! What are you doing? - Liliana! [screams] Marcial, come help me! [tires squealing] [indistinct shouting] [Liliana] Shit. [grunts] Stop! Stop! Open it! [both straining] [passengers screaming] - [shouts] - [Sebastián gasps] Asshole! Open it! [Marcial grunts] - [Liliana shouts] - [Marcial grunts] No! No! Oh! [Marcial screams] [Liliana] No! [screams in pain] [Marcial shouts] [groans] [Sebastián grunts] [passengers scream] [Sebastián coughing] [panting] [rustling inside bus] [Marcial gasping weakly] [soft whooshing in distance] [sighs, echoing] Look. Look! They're coming. They're beautiful, aren't they? [low rumbling] [whooshing intensifies] [gurgling] [celestial tones resonate] [tones grow to a crescendo] [tones fade] [Liliana breathing shakily] [softly] Shh. It's okay. It's going to be all right. [shudders] [Sebastián] Don't be afraid. It's for your own good. When you see them, you'll understand. [whines] No, no! No, no, no, please! Please! No, please, no! [screams, gasps] [Sebastián] See? [distorted female voice] Liliana. [female voice laughing] My love. - [distorted female voice] Liliana! - What's wrong? - [female voice laughing] - What are you doing? Come back! [distorted female voice] Liliana. [squelching crack] [angelic tones resonate] - [gentle fluttering soars] - [man sobbing] Oh God. What have you done? What have you done? I'm sorry, Lázaro. I'm sorry you won't get to see. I'm sorry. Why? Why? [low rumbling] [whispers reverberating] [heavenly tones resonate] [tones fade] - [Sebastián sighs] - [Anna] You've saved them, Dad. [sighs] They'll be all right? Of course. Their souls are free now. You saw their light, right? It's so beautiful there. I really wish that you could see it. When will I? When will they show me? Very soon. But there are still too many lost sheep out there. You are their shepherd. Save them, and we'll be together again. [Anna] You, me, and Mom. [loud whirring] 9 MONTHS EARLIER Not too bad, huh, boss? Ten thousand more like this, and we may still save the world. [cell phone vibrating] Hang on a minute. - [in German] Turbines one and two? - [man on phone] Yes. They're both offline? - Since ten o'clock. - But how? I understand if one worker fell into a turbine... - Several. - Several? Several workers. Fell into both turbines? [shakily] Or jumped. Someone says they saw them jump. Everything all right? Uh, the Düsseldorf hydropower plant is down. [reporter on radio] And we wrap up with devastating news out of Poland, where a head-on collision between two commuter trains has left dozens dead in the outskirts of Warsaw. The cause of the accident is still unknown, but sources suggest that the engineer on one of the trains ignored the railway signals. The government... [workers murmuring] [woman] I don't understand what's happening. - [cell phone vibrating] - [man] Go pick her up. - Laura. - [Laura] Honey, where are you? I just got to the office. Everything okay? Have you been watching the news? The train in Poland? No. It's not just Poland. Just turn on the news. Turn on the news. Hang on. Give me a second. It's happening everywhere. It's happening here. [woman on TV] ...appears to have spread to the rest of Europe. The WHO describes it as a wave of psychotic behavior that leads to self-harm and, in some cases, suicide. What we are seeing are not, I repeat, are not isolated incidents. According to reports, there have been hundreds of deaths... Jesus. ...in Madrid alone. [Laura] Can you go get Anna? - Yeah. Yeah, yeah. - [Laura] Sebastián. Right now. Don't worry, honey. I'll go... - [loud clang] - [man choking] [softly] No. [alarm chirps] - [alarm blaring] - [horn honking] [people screaming] [siren wailing] - [horn blares] - [Sebastián gasps] [man 1] What the hell?

Where is she? [breathing shakily] [children crying] Anna? Hey. Hey, look. No, no, no, no. It's all right, girls. It's okay. Hey. Anna. I'm here. Hey, look at me. Look at me. Calm down. It's Dad. Hey. It's time to go. Okay? - [crowd clamoring] - [man] Faster! Where's your sister? Paula! Paula! [people screaming] [alarm blaring] [man 2] Sebastián? - [Anna gasps] - [sighs] Father. - You're taking Anna home? - [Sebastián] Yes. Laura's waiting. We're leaving Barcelona for a few days. [priest] So you're not ready to see? See what? [priest] I'm not sure. But I'm ready. I've been waiting all my life. I joined the seminary at 18. I was looking for a sign. - I don't get it. - And, in all these years, nothing. I feared that I'd been born in the wrong time. That the days of miracles and prophets had passed me by. Let us through, please. The Lord commanded Moses from within the flames of the burning bush. He challenged Job... as a furious whirlwind. But for me... there was only... silence. Until now. People are dying, Father. You really believe it's a miracle? To look the Lord in the eyes... it may be more than our minds can endure. But if our God and his angels have come down to walk the earth, I want to welcome them. Don't you? I just want my daughter to be safe. Of course you do. They say that faith is believing in what you cannot see. But I need to see it for myself. [screams continue outside] [softly] Whatever happens out there, whatever you hear, keep your eyes on this. Okay? [necklace jingling] - [panting] - [rapid footsteps] - [distant screaming] - [line beeps] [operator] All lines are busy at the moment. Please try again later. - [line beeps] - [operator] All lines... It's okay. We're almost there. [sirens approaching] Laura! [Laura] Honey! Sweetheart! Anna! - I'm here. Honey, are you okay? - [Anna] Mom? - Are you okay? It's me. Yeah? - [Anna] Yeah. - And you, my love? - I'm okay. - You promise? - Is everything ready? I packed the car. Come on. - [brakes screech] - Laura! Watch out! [sighs] You're okay. [brakes screech] [Sebastián, echoing] Laura! - Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. - [wings flapping] [birds singing overhead] [Sebastián] It's been a week since my last confession. I took the Lord's name in vain. More than once. I have been tempted by those living a less solitary life. I envied them. And there's something else. - [Anna giggling] - [Sebastián] I've lied. I had no choice. I had to save them. But still, I lied. Can the Lord forgive someone who lies to be reunited with his family? [whispers reverberate] - [low rumbling] - [celestial tones resonate] [tones fade] [heavy breathing] [birds chirping] [loud thud in distance] [loud thud] [wings flapping] [loud thud] [steady banging continues] [glass cracks] [glass strains] Brother. Have you seen them too? Their ships have traveled millions of light-years to get here. They'll take us to the stars. No, brother. They're angels. [weakly] They're radiant. [skull cracks] [angelic tones resonate] [ethereal choir singing] [tense string music playing] [glass smashing] PHARMACY [pigeons cooing] [glass crunches loudly] Hello? Is anyone there? Who's there? I'm guessing that you're afraid. That's okay. We all are. It's the one thing more terrifying than this darkness, right? Not knowing who you can trust. I'm Claire. What's your name? - [dog barking and growling] - [Sebastián gasps] - Who the fuck are you? - I, uh... No, don't. Why the fuck are you sneaking up on us? Heel, heel. I've been robbed, okay? Uh, beaten up. Who am I supposed to trust after that? Well, it's not us. Hey. You have to hold on tighter, got it? - [man 1] Claire? - [Claire] Yes? - [man 1] You okay? - [Claire] I'm okay. [growling] [man 2] What is it, Dimas? What is it, boy? [quietly] Motherfucker. Let's go! Now! Take me with you. - Do you think we're an NGO or something? - We don't have to be assholes, Rafa. Listen, if you wanna stay and chat with your new friend, fine. - But I'm leaving. - I can get a generator. I know where they store them. I can take you. - Okay, man. Right. - [Sebastián] I'm an engineer. My company, they stored the generators for the construction sites. - Where? - First, take me with you. [dog growls] [glass clinking] [low rumbling] Come on. Let's go. Keep up. I'm not waiting for you. [Claire] Oh. Okay. Take this. Don't let go. [rumbling intensifies] [echoing roar] [blowing whistle] [dogs whining] You brought someone? - He needed help. - He says he has a generator. Isabel, don't worry. I'll watch him. [Sebastián] Where are we? An old bomb shelter from the war. If these walls could keep out the fascists' bombs, it can keep these things out too. [Rafa] Can someone remind the history teacher who won the war? [Isabel] We're holding out. It's not winning, but it's something. - Who's that? - [Isabel] He says he has a generator. Anna? Sofia. Claire! How are you, kiddo? Oh! I missed you too. I found something for you. - [in German] Chocolate! - Mm-hmm. Chocolate. - Your accent's so silly. - Oh. [Claire in English] No idea what you're saying. And how about some food for the adults? - Do you like beans? - No. Good. Because we didn't find any. - [Claire laughs] - You. With me. [Sebastián breathing shakily] This is Octavio. I'm Rafa. You? Sebastián. Are you alone, Sebastián? [Sebastián] Yes. [Rafa] And those stitches? Do that on your own? [quietly] I was with a group. - We had a doctor. - [Rafa] And where's your doctor now? Hmm? Dead. They're all dead. Did you kill them, Sebastián? - They saw the creatures. - But not you? Because I hid. I hid as soon as the men got there. What men? They travel through the city... without blindfolds. They want the whole world to see. - What are you talking about? - About what's going on out there. Above this shithole you're living in. [Rafa] Give me the map. Where is it? - Where's what? - The generator. Where is it? You'll get one to come with you. At the most, two. When you come back alone, they'll be suspicious. They'll be afraid of you. - Come on. - You have to get them all outside. [Rafa] What are you fucking waiting for? The girl. Use the girl. - There isn't one. - [Octavio] What do you mean? The generator. I made it up. - Hey, Rafa! - [Rafa] Son of a bitch! - Motherfucker! - What's going on? Hey, Rafa, stop! Rafa, take it easy. - [Rafa] He lied! - He lied about what? - Isabel, stay out of this. - There's no generator! [Sebastián] I'm sorry, okay? Oh, you're sorry? Oh, okay, it's fine. I was alone. I was so scared I could hardly think. - So you lied to our fucking faces? - You were going to leave me out there. He's not wrong, Rafa. When we found this asshole, he was sneaking up on us. Now he lies to our fucking faces, and you're gonna take his side? [speaking German] Don't look at me. It wasn't my idea to let this guy in. - Well, allow me to solve the problem. - No! Hey. Hey, Rafa. - No, no, no! Please don't! - [Octavio] Hey. - [Sebastián] No, don't! - We can't kill the guy. Don't worry. He'll do that to himself. Isn't that right? - [Octavio] Hold on. Stop. - [Rafa] Let's go. Come on. Can we lower the testosterone levels a bit? - [shouting in German] - [Octavio] Stop, Rafa! [continues shouting in German] No one here speaks any fucking German! [continues shouting in German] She's asking you not to hurt me. [softly] Hey. [in German] It's okay. I'll be fine. I promise. [in English] Okay? You speak German? My accent's on the thick side, but I make do. [Claire] Ask her where her family is. [in German] Sofia, where are your parents? [speaking German] [interpreting in English] My mom and I were on vacation. We went by ship. A cruise ship. I was excited. It was my first time on a boat. [gulls calling] [continues speaking German] I remember we were going up the ramp when we heard yelling. People started pushing and shoving each other. Hard. And I got scared. Suddenly, I saw someone fall into the water down below. [continues speaking German] [Sebastián] Then I saw another jump and another... and another. [Sofia shudders] [Sebastián] Sofia. [in German] What happened next? [speaking German] [in English] I don't know how we managed to escape from there. My mom picked me up and covered my eyes. When I opened them, we were in a van. And my mom, she'd covered all the windows with paper and cardboard. She turned on the radio. - We couldn't hear... anything at first. - [static crackles] A little bit later, we heard a voice. - [speaking German] - [Sebastián] A woman's voice. [woman on radio] This is an emergency broadcast. This is an emergency broadcast. The woman, she said there was a safe place up the mountain. [Claire] Mountain? What mountain? Is that a castle? [speaks German] It looks like Montjuïc. How so? Castle, mountain, Barcelona. It's Montjuïc. We can't just assume, Isabel. That could be the Alcázar of Toledo. Who knows where that signal was from. [in German] Did you go? To the mountain? - [speaking German] - [in English] You have to take that. - The gondola. - [Isabel] Told you it's Montjuïc. [speaking German] My mom used a scarf to cover up my eyes. [continues speaking German] Outside, people were screaming, running, crying. Mom held my hand so tight it hurt. People kept crashing into us. - [continues speaking German] - [Sebastián] Then I fell. - [mother, echoing] Sofia! - [sobs] [in German] It was my fault. - I let go of her hand. - Hey. - She told me to hold on tight... - [Sebastián] Hey. Hey. It's not your fault. You hear me? It's not your fault. - [Claire, in English] It's okay. - Hey. [Claire] It's okay. It was nighttime when I found her. She was alone. Cold, shivering. I could only guess what she'd been through. [Isabel] Sorry. Look, I don't mean to be insensitive, but am I the only one who heard the part about a "safe place"? Isabel, we're in a bomb shelter. A castle might've been good in the Middle Ages. If I had to set up a refugee camp, that's the place. Elevated. And it's surrounded by walls. It would be easy to seal it off. With the gondola as the only way in and out. The survivors get in, but those things don't. Oh, now the dog trainer thinks he's General Patton. Careful, all right? I was in the military. Don't tell me you're actually considering this? [Octavio] We don't know if it still works. If the gondola still works, or if the walls are still standing. [Roberto] Thank you. At least the pizza delivery guy has a little common sense. I think we should go. Did anybody fucking ask you? Let him speak. And don't you dare tell me to be quiet. - If Sofia's mother's still alive... - That's a big if. ...then chances are she went to the castle. It's the only place she would have thought to go to in the city. [Roberto] Montjuïc is all the way across town. And you never know when you're gonna run into one of those things. It's suicide. You know that, right? It's literally suicide. And for what? To find out that this girl's mother is already dead? - [Isabel] That's enough. - The girl can't understand. What happens when you run out of food? Nothing will grow in a tunnel. Staying here is suicide. A slow one. But it's suicide either way. He's right. We can't stay down here forever. The only people that stay underground this long are the ones who are already dead. [Octavio] Let's take a vote. [Roberto] They let you vote in your country? Fuck you, Marqués. Who here wants to go? I hate to admit it, but he's right. - Think this through. - I'm sorry, honey. You're on your own, Roberto. You know what? I've lived in Barcelona for 30 years, and I've never gone up to Montjuïc. [Isabel] Then let's add it to your list of things to do before you die. - [screaming] - [wings flap] [loud whooshing] [Sebastián gasps] Good morning, Sleeping Beauty. Get up. - [dog whining] - [Rafa] Easy, big guy. I know. I hate these too. Shh. Take it easy. It's okay. Good boy. That's right. That's it, buddy. Good boy. [quietly] Let's do this. Easy, boy. Okay, easy. [Octavio] 257 Diputació Street. We should take the next left. [Rafa] Heel, heel. Good boy. Stay close. [breathing shakily] 8 MONTHS EARLIER [automated voice on GPS] In 15 meters, turn left. Turn left. [man] Outta the way! [automated voice] In ten meters, you will reach your destination. - [distant screaming] - [Sebastián gasps] [phone ringing] [automated voice] You have reached your destination. Hello? My daughter has a fever! She needs a doctor! Hello? Is anyone there? [phone continues ringing] [gentle whooshing] [low rumbling reverberating] [whispering resonating] [silence falls] [Sebastián] I'm sorry, honey. If Mom were here, she'd know what to do. [dogs whining] I was meaning to ask you, how did you end up here in Barcelona? - A book tour, of all things. - [Sebastián] Really? What was the book? - You'll laugh. - I won't. [sighs] Age of Madness: How to Survive the Modern World by Dr. Claire Barnes. - [chuckles] I'm sorry. - [both laugh] That's okay. The irony is not lost on me. Sofia, want to go to bed? Yeah? [chuckles] Mm-hmm. Hmm? [gently] Night-night. [speaks German] [Claire sighs] [snoring softly] [dogs panting] [angelic tones resonating] [Anna] Can you hear that? [quietly] Yes. They're singing. [choir of angelic voices grows louder] [singing stops] [leaves fluttering] Stay close. [distorted male voice 1] Claire... Claire... [Roberto's voice] How dare you? Look at me when I'm talking to you, bitch! [Isabel's voice] Hurry. I don't want my husband to see. [distorted male voice 2] Octavio, where are you? I can't see you. [male voice 1] I need you, Claire. I'm right here. - Look at me. Why don't you look at me? - [Claire whining] [mother's voice in German] My darling, where are you? - Come. I can't find you. - Mom? [heavenly tones building] [tones grow to a crescendo] - [barking frantically] - [in English] Jonás! Jonás! [male voice 1] Look at me, Claire! Why did you leave me? [mother's voice in German] Honey, come to Mommy. [male voice 1 in English] Why did you leave me? [Dimas barking] [Rafa grunts] Dimas! Dimas! Come here! Come here, Dimas! [male voice 1] Where were you? Where did you go? [mother's voice in German] Sofia, I'm here. Mom? Mom? [male voice 2 in English] Octavio? Octavio? - Come here, boy! - [barking] Hang on, buddy! [groans] - Come here, Sofia! - [low rumbling] [Sofia, in German] Mom? Mom? [mother's voice] Sofia, come here. [Rafa in English] Dimas? [scoffs] There you are. I got you. [barking] Where did you go? I'm here... [in German] Mom, where are you? [mother's voice] Take off the blindfold. Let me see those beautiful eyes. Let me see them. - Are you sure? - [mother's voice] Yes, it's okay. It's okay because Mom is here. - [mother's laughter echoing] - [mother's voice] Sofia. Sofia. - [Sofia] Mama! - [Octavio in English] It's not her. - It's not her. - Mama! [celestial tones swell] Rafa! Rafa! - [barking echoing] - Where are you, boys? [dog whimpering in pain] - What happened? - [dog yips, whines] Hey, boys. Are you okay? Huh? [whimpering grows louder] [whimpering stops] [low rumbling] [menacing murmurs echo] Rafa! [choking] [heavenly tones resonate] - [male voice 1] You left me behind! - [Claire whimpering] [male voice 1] You left me behind when I needed you most! Look at me! Let's go. Claire, let's go. [whispers reverberating] [low rumbling] Rafa! Rafa! Where are you? [Octavio mutters, grunts] Come on, come on, come on, come on. Easy, easy, easy. - [chomps] - [screams] Fuck. - [Isabel] Roberto! - He bit me! Get inside. Come on. [blows whistle] Isabel! Isabel! Rafa! Oh, my fucking hand! We have to go. Hurry up. Let's go! [grunts] [whistle continues blowing] Get inside! - [Octavio] Isabel? - Yes. [Octavio] Rafa! Where is he? Where's Rafa? Shut the door! [Octavio] Where's Rafa? - I don't... I don't think he made it. - Rafa's dead. Shut the door. [whispers fade] [Octavio] There's no windows. You can take off your blindfolds. Damn, that looks like shit, Marqués. I have gauze. If you say please. [inhales sharply] [birds singing above] I heard you. Roberto, no. I heard you. With him. That wasn't me. You think I don't know the sound of my wife fucking someone else? - That's not what I was... - [Roberto grunts] You want to know what I heard? Huh? - Please don't. - Our argument that day. Do you remember what you said to me when you found out? Let me do it. [Sebastián] Hey. You okay? [crying] I let go of her hand. The one thing I told her I would never do. How can they do that? How do they know about him? How... How can they use his voice? - I don't know. - [Octavio] Maybe the observer's effect. [Claire] What? The observer's effect. In quantum mechanics, particles are in this state of indefinition. All states are possible until observed. Then all possibilities collapse into one. Just one. So... So you're saying these things... they can...? If somehow these creatures are some kind of quantum beings... maybe they don't even have a permanent state. Maybe they're changing, fluctuating all the time. Until we hear them... or we see them. And then... they take form based on us. Our fears, our grief, our pain. [Claire] So some people see aliens, others see demons. [Octavio] Or their torturer or their God. - That sounds like a lot of shit to me. - Shut up, asshole! You talk down to me because I delivered food to your house? I have a degree in physics from the University of Mexico. I'm waiting for your country to recognize it. [Roberto] How much did you pay for it? How much was the bribe? [Octavio] Is that crown heavy, asshole? Do you ever take it off, huh? What was it? What did you hear? Jack. My parents called him Jojo. He was a genius, my brother. He was also clinically depressed. I wasn't even in town when they found him. But I still hear his voice all the time. But not like that. Not... Not like he was right next to me. Like... Like I could touch him. I'm sorry. The truth is, I was in denial. I couldn't even admit to myself that he was dead. Grief can break you like that, you know? What about you? What did you hear? Nothing. I didn't hear anything. - You know you can talk to me. - Where's Sofia? - Where is the girl? - Oh shit. Sofia? - No. Calm down. You rest. I'll find her. - Sofia? I'll take care of her. It's okay. [Isabel] You are fighting like children, and we lost the actual child. [Sofia crying] [softly] Hey. [in German] Don't cry. Is she dead? No. How do you know? [necklace jingling] Do you know what this is? A seraph. The most beautiful of all the angels. Their beauty is so great that only God can look straight at them. It's beautiful. [Sebastián] Mm-hmm. It's yours. [necklace jingles] [Anna in English] Hail Mary, the Lord is with thee. [shakily] Blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Hear my prayer. Virgin Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death. - Amen. - [man] No! No! No! - Hail Mary, full of grace. - [man screaming outside] Blessed art thou among women... [man screaming] Please, don't! No! No! No! [echoing birdsong] - No! Please don't! - [priest hushes] - No, please don't! - [priest] You're nervous. I know. So was I. [man whimpers] [priest] What you're about to see cannot be explained. It is the alpha and the omega. It is eternity itself. - [distorted whooshing] - [man screaming hysterically] Okay. Okay, hold on. Hang on. ["Les Enfants du Pirée" playing on headphones] It's okay. It's okay. [muffled screams continue in distance] [song fades slowly] Three days. - Stop, Dad. - Stop what? It's your birthday. How many times will you turn 11? - Once. - That's right. Once. It's going to be crazy. A cake, dancing. And we're gonna have a clown, even if it means I have to cover my face in flour. I'm turning 11, Dad. Not five. Yeah, you're right. Good night, honey. [chuckles softly] [exhales slowly] - [screams] - [wings flap] [Anna echoing] It was mine. [Sebastián breathing shakily] [softly] What? [Anna, echoing] The angel. It was mine. You and Mom gave it to me for my first communion. It was my favorite. [whispering] The girl was frightened. - She needed something... - She's not your daughter. I know. - [Anna] She's just another sheep. - I know. Help her find the way, and we'll be together again. [door squeaks open] - Hey. - Hey. Can I ask you... who's Anna? What? Sofia showed me the pendant you gave her. Was she your... wife? Your daughter? Was that who you heard yesterday, when they spoke to us? I understand if you don't want to talk. But it might help to open up. I won't even charge you. [scoffs] It's easy for me to slip and believe Jojo's there. [soft murmurs echo] [Claire] Tempting, even. What I wouldn't do... to hear his voice. I mean... really hear it. [Anna, echoing] Don't listen to her. But it's not him. Those things, they burrow into our brains. [Anna] She's lying. They take our beliefs, our fears, and they twist them. She wants you to lose faith, Dad. They turn them into something they can use to manipulate you. [Roberto moaning] [Isabel] Roberto? Roberto! [Roberto moans] Okay. - Roberto, what's wrong? - Okay. - [Roberto] Ow. - [Claire] Let me have a look. [in German] What's wrong with him? [Octavio, in English] You think it's sepsis? It's hard to tell. But he's not gonna make it to the castle like this. We're gonna have to find some antibiotics to bring his temperature down. Fuck, Marqués. [Roberto groans weakly, panting] [birds singing outside] [knocking on door] Hello? Please, we need help. One of us is injured. [knocks, door creaks open] [door squeaks open] Hello? Is anyone here? [gasps] Fuck! Sorry. My bad. [laughs, sighs] Okay. Let's keep going. I think this is a bathroom. You guys keep going. I'll check it out. [Octavio] Shut all the windows. [flies buzzing] [Octavio] Hey! The kitchen's secured! RAT POISON [Octavio] Sebastián. I found some cans of sardines. Is your room secured? Shh. Yes. Everything is closed. [whispers reverberating] [Octavio groaning] Oh no. No. No, no. No, no. No... - [Claire] Sebastián? - [Sebastián] No. I don't understand. - Sebastián? Octavio? - [Sebastián] I don't. You okay? What happened? I don't know. I heard him scream, and I... He must've... He must've missed a window. [Claire] What do you mean, he missed a window? [glass clinking] [Claire] Octavio? Talk to me! [Jojo's voice] Claire... Shit. We have to get out of here. [echoing] Her blindfold. Take it off now. [Claire] Sebastián, can you hear me? Let's go. Now. [Anna] Do it, Dad. Save her. - Save her, Dad. - Sebastián, we have to go now! [Anna] Dad! - Let's go! - [Anna] Dad! - Let's go! - [softly] Yeah. - Yeah. - [Claire] Okay. Let's go. [Anna echoing] Dad! [door slams closed] Slow down, okay? [Roberto grunts] - That's it. - Thank you. - [exhales] - Ah. What would you do without me? [chuckles] I wouldn't have... gotten divorced. I wouldn't have. - Oh, no? [chuckles] - Uh-uh. I was so furious. And hurt. More than anything, it hurt my pride. - I was so lonely then, Roberto. - Oh, I know. I know. My lawyers were out for blood, and... But I wasn't gonna go through with it. Probably for the best because my lawyers wanted half of everything. [both laugh] [Claire] Isabel. What did you find? Where's Octavio? I did find this, though. It's not much, but it's an antibiotic, so... - [Roberto] Thank you. - This should help. [Roberto inhales sharply] What happened? He said... how Octavio must've... left the window open. But...? I don't know. [panting] [Anna] Why didn't you do it? Why didn't you take her blindfold off? - [shakily] I... I didn't see it. - See what? His... His light. When Octavio was... I... I didn't see it. That's because you're losing your faith, Dad. Am I the shepherd, Anna? Or am I the wolf? [footsteps approaching] [metal scraping] [pigeons cooing] [Roberto moaning] [whispers resonating] [crow cawing] [cawing grows louder] - [echoing] - [screams inaudibly] [distant jingling] [engine revving] [Claire] Shit. We've gotta get out of here. Run. Make a chain. [engine revs] - A chain! Come on! - [Claire] Hold on to me. Come on! Come on! Turn right! [Roberto yells] [Claire] Isabel! - Roberto! - Isabel! [brakes screech] - [Isabel grunts] - [moaning] My leg. [Isabel] Roberto. No! Stop! We have to go back! - [Roberto coughing] - [Isabel] Come on, then. [whispers reverberating] Stop! We can't leave them behind! What would I do without you? [laughs] Listen to me! Listen to me! We have to go back! No! [low rumbling] It's too late. They're already here. [footsteps approaching] I guess it's time to go. I want to see you one last time. [rumbling intensifies] [muffled whispering continues outside] [door rattling] - You motherfucker! - Claire, no! Claire! You can see. You fucking lied to us! You've seen those things, haven't you? [Anna, echoing] Open the door, Dad. - You're one of them. - I saved you from them! Open the door and let them see. - [Claire] You killed Octavio. - [Anna] Two more. Oh my God! You probably killed Rafa too! Just two more, and we'll be together. - I can help you. - Whoa! Don't come any closer. You, me, and Mom, together. - Stop it. - Who are you talking to? We miss you so much. - You have to stop, please. - Who are you talking to? - [Anna] Don't you miss us? - I need you to stop. I can't think. - We'll be together! - Just be quiet! Dad! Find them, Dad. Save their souls. [Sebastián] Sofia! Claire! Claire, wait! Please! Claire! Sofia! Wait! Claire! [Claire] Okay. Listen to me. We're gonna have to go outside. Outside, you understand? Yeah? Okay. I am going to be right next to you the entire time. [Sebastián] Claire! Please! Claire. Please, wait! [Claire] Okay. Let's go. [panting] [gasps] [gulls calling in distance] [Claire grunts] [whispers reverberating below] - [Sebastián] Claire! - Stay back! - [Sebastián] Claire, please. - [Claire gasps] Back off! [crows cawing] [Sebastián, nearby] I just wanna help. Same way you helped Rafa? Or Octavio? It's better this way. Believe me. [Claire yells] [gasps] [screams] [breathing shakily] [Sebastián in German] It's okay. You don't have to be afraid. You hear me? Everything's going to be okay. They're the most beautiful of all the angels, remember? [Anna in English] Save her, Dad. [voice distorting] Do it for her. For me. Help her see. It's the only way. [Sebastián] Anna. Anna, no more, please. Don't you miss me? Of course. Of course, honey. [Anna] Don't you want us to be together again? [softly] There's nothing I want more. Then do it. It's the only way, Dad. [sobs] [in German] Who are you talking to? Is that... Is that Anna? [necklace jingling] [in English] She's not your daughter, Dad! She's not! I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. - [Sofia sobbing] [Sebastián] ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ - ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ - [scoffs] Dad! - ♪ I can't hear you ♪ - Come on, Dad. ♪ But a very happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you! ♪ Yay! What? Nothing. I'm just glad that you like it. Oh, no, no, no, thank you. I'm trying to lose a little weight. It's almost bikini season. - [pounding on door] - [gasps] [banging continues] - [Anna whimpers] - [Sebastián] Go to your room. Right now! [loud banging continues] [Sebastián] No. No. No! [blow echoes, fades] [groans] Oh no. Anna? [grunts] Anna? Anna? [gasps] - Dad? - I'm here, sweetie. [priest] You're awake, and yet you sleep. We are living in an age of miracles. - Open your eyes and see. - [Sebastián] Anna, listen. Don't open your eyes. Whatever you do, keep them closed. You hear me? [Anna crying softly] [distant whispers echoing] [priest grunts softly] - All is well. - [Sebastián] Don't listen to him! - [priest] Don't be scared. - Don't listen to him! Don't touch her! Don't touch her! - No, I don't want to! - [Sebastián] Anna! [priest] This is an age of prophets. And of miracles. Father? - [low rumbling] - [reverberating whispers intensifying] Come and see. [whooshing echoes] [Sebastián] No, no, no, no! - Close your eyes! - [angelic choir singing] [Sebastián] Close your eyes. Don't look! - It's so beautiful. - [Sebastián] No. Close your eyes. No, sweetie! Don't look! Keep your eyes closed! My love. My love... Please. My love, look away. My love, look away! Not my girl! No! No, no, no, no! No! No, no, no! No, no, no, no! No, no! [echoing] Come and see, Dad. [sounds fade] [muffled gasp] [cries out] [screams] [grunts] [breathing shakily] [whispers reverberate above] [murmuring soars] [whispers intensifying] [angelic choir singing] It doesn't matter. Okay, Dad? We'll be together again soon. [gulls calling overhead] [Sebastián] Hey. - No, no, no, no, no! Hey. It's okay. - Sofia! - It's okay. She's okay. - [Sofia in German] Claire! Claire, I'm here! - [in English] No fucking way. - Look, I understand. I really do. But you also have to understand I can guide you. - I can see. - That is exactly why I don't trust you. I wouldn't trust me either. But I am the only shot you've got to make it to the tramway. I'll take my chances. Come on, Sofia. Let's go. - And you'll take her chances too? - Fuck you. I'll protect her with my life. You know it. Claire, listen to me. Please. You once asked me who Anna was. She was my daughter. You were right. Grief can break you. I thought I was chosen. But I was just broken. Please. Let me help her. [bird singing in distance] [door slams open] [priest] Search the apartments. [seers speaking indistinctly] [woman] They're at the top. [Claire panting] [Sebastián] Okay. [door above opens, closes] [woman] Where you going? That's a pretty big fall, right? Doesn't look very safe. We just want to leave, okay? Hello, beautiful. Hey. Come here. I wanna show you something. Please just leave her alone. Yeah? Or what? You think you're saving her by not letting her see? [gasps] [woman grunts] [both groan] So you've seen them, but you reject them? - [yells] - [groans] You're not worthy! [screams] - [thuds] - [gasps] [in German] What happened? [groans] [Sebastián in English] Wait. Inside. [engine splutters] [engine turns over] [panting] [Claire gasps] [Anna, echoing] Dad! [tires squeal] [Claire] Okay. Let's go. Let's go. Go. Quickly. - [Anna, distorted] They saw you. - No. They saw the candle, and they heard you sing. [motorcycle approaching] - Go, go, go, go, go! - What's happening? For God's sake, tell me what's going... You two, go. Go up. Find the gondolas. - Okay, but... - Take her to the castle. You're not coming? I've got to stop them. I've got to make sure they don't cross. [softly] Hey. [in German] You are a very brave girl, Sofia. I'm going to need you to take care of Claire. Okay? [in English] Go. [softly] Go. - Go. - Okay. [quietly] Okay. Okay. Okay. [priest] Sebastián. My friend. Why did you abandon us? Because deep down, I always knew that you killed her. [both panting] [Sofia screams] [gasping] It's okay. I've got you. I've got you. [straining] Oh my God. That was too close. We're not gonna make it like this. [Sofia crying softly] [Sebastián] Beware of false prophets who come to you dressed in sheep's clothing... Let's go. ...but inside, they are ravenous wolves. - Beware of false prophets... - [priest] Brother... ...who come to you dressed in sheep's clothing. Let us pass. But inside, they are ravenous wolves. - Beware of false prophets who come to you... - I... I am the right hand of the Lord. I am a humble instrument of the Lord's will. The Lord's will? You follow the will of the creatures! [priest] Sebastián! Do not oppose his will. Do not turn your back on God! [echoing] That is not my God! [gulls calling] [Claire] Okay. Come with me. Feel this? Hold on to this. Don't move. Uh... [grunts] No! [grunting] - No! No! - Claire? [gasps] Okay. Come here. [grunts] [bell ringing] [ringing echoes] [ringing continues overhead] [gentle whooshing] [low rumbling] [Jojo's voice] Claire... Claire... Whatever you do, don't open your eyes. [machinery clangs] [gasps] [low rumbling rushes forward] [gulls squawking frantically] Let them through. - No. - [Anna] He saved me, Dad. Don't you want to save them? - Don't you want them to be free? - No. [quietly] No. [breathing shakily] [quietly] No. [Jojo's voice] Where are you going? Where are you going, Claire? [mother in German] Sofia. [Jojo's voice in English] You can't help. You left me. [mother in German] Sofia, come. [Jojo's voice, in English] Like you failed me. - That's who you are. - [Claire] No. - [Jojo's voice] That's who you've been. - [Claire] No! Shut up! - [Jojo's voice] I need you to see. - Shut up! You're not real. You're dead. - [grunts] - [priest groans] - [Jojo's voice] Where are you going? - Sofia! [Jojo's voice] You can't help. Think you can? You think you can, but all you'll do is fail her. [necklace jingling] [Jojo's voice] But you'll just fail her, just like you failed me. - [Claire] Sofia! - [Jojo's voice] That's who you are. - You think you can. - Sofia! [mother in German] Sofia, come. I'm here. It's Mommy. - [Claire] Sofia. - [gulls calling] [mother in German] Sofia, come. Come, Sofia. Sofia, come! [Sofia screams] [calling of gulls intensifies] [in English] I'm so sorry. - [Sofia screaming] - [glass shattering] - [priest groans] - [Sebastián grunts] [screams in pain] [Jojo's voice] Look at me! Why? You left me behind. You left me behind. I need your help! Help me! You left me behind! You left me! Help me! Behind! I can't take it anymore! - Help me! - [both gasp] You left me behind! [mother's voice in German] Sofia, take off the blindfold! Look at me! [doors creak open] [Jojo's voice in English] Think you can help? - You'll just fail her... - One, two, three, four. [doors creak closed] - [distorted murmuring] - It's four. It's four. [panting] So we jump on three. [both grunting] You... You won't survive this. [Jojo's voice] Just like you failed me. You left me behind! - One... - [Jojo's voice] You left me behind! But they will. [straining] - [Jojo's voice] You can't help her... - Two... [whooshing rushes forward] [both groaning] - Three! - [Jojo's voice] I need you! [Claire groans] [priest gasping] [Sebastián moans] [shuddering] [both panting] [softly] It's okay. [sighs] It's okay. We made it. [exhales deeply] Bye, Jojo. [bright instrumental music playing] [gulls calling] [gondola clangs] - [Claire gasps] - [man] Your hands. Your hands. Show me your hands. Anyone else coming up the tramway? - [quietly] No. - [man] What? - No. - [man] Help them. - [radio beeps] - We have two survivors. A woman and a child. Unarmed. We're bringin' 'em up to you. [radio beeps] [bright instrumental music continues] [birds singing in courtyard] [indistinct chatter] [bright music swells] [birdsong intensifies] [mother] Sofia? - Sofia! Sofia! - Momma! [shouting in German] Please! Please! She's... She's my daughter. She's harmless. [exclaims] [in German] My darling! My darling! I've missed you so much! You're so big now! [in English] Follow me. [flashlight clicks on] - [Claire] What's this about? - Just hold still, please. You're trying to find out if I'm one of them, right? [woman] So you've run into them. [scoffs] You could say that. Yeah. [woman] We call them "seers." And I'm surprised you survived an encounter with them. I wouldn't have made it here if it wasn't for one of them. They can be reached, you know? They're still in there somewhere. What's the blood for? What are you looking for, exactly? I might be able to help. I'm a doctor in psychiatry. A chemical marker. An epigenetic alteration of the DNA. So you're looking for signs of trauma. In rare cases, extreme forms of stress can affect people's DNA. Change it, even. Abuse, violence... Grief. Sure. Grief too. And these... seers, they all share the same epigenetic alteration? That's what we're trying to find out. Their DNA could be the key to create immunity. Right. But how would you test that? [man] November 16, 1800 hours. Dr. Pascal and I are about to conduct our 12th animal trial since the capture of the creature. Our subjects today are three adult rats of normal health. We've managed to increase the exposure to the creature to 48 seconds before demise. [Dr. Pascal hushes] [in French] That's it. [man, in English] We hope that the new seer compound will get us past the one-minute mark. [monitor beeping steadily] [rats squeaking] [door closes heavily] Exposure to the containment room commencing... now. [metallic creaking] [low rumbling] [monitor beeping rapidly] - [rumbling intensifies] - [murmuring reverberates] [birds chirping frantically] Please let me see it. - [murmuring grows to a roar] - [seer] I want to see it! [sounds fade] [ominous orchestral music playing] [music fades]
