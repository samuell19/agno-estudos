Chess is generally known as a royal game. But sometimes people overlook the fact... ...that a few pawns can seriously kick ass as well. S..t, they're all over this place. Now what? Plan B. -What? -What is Plan B? This is Plan B. That's Plan B? You could have cleaned up. Let's go, then. Yeah! Can't you carry anymore? A bit too much, huh? Yeah, okay. Come on, you bum! -S..t, I'm out of ammo. -Let me try. -I'm empty too. -Great! Watch out! What's wrong? The boss is in there. He calls us jerks. S..t! I see you, you jerks! What do we do? -Come on, cocksuckers! -Do you have a pen? A pen? I'm gonna shoot you another asshole! Huh? F..k You F..k! That's how it's gotta be, right? With some fight action, some shooting. It's gonna be awesome! Cha, react! Okay... -You know what I mean, right? -No. Like... fight action... Phong, react! Yeah. -Ah! -Yeah! That's good, that's good! That's really good. Did you bring these guys? Super. You're fired. But... the way you want to do it isn't going to work. It's either that way or not at all. Interesting. Listen to me, George Michael, it's going to be exciting. Take Jackie Chan and Jet Li... ...and f..k off from my set before I kick your ass. Got it? Idiots. These boys were about to become my best friends. PLAN B Why am I not supposed to be at the funeral? Aleksey was my brother-in-law. And this gentleman is my worst nightmare... My biggest enemy. Two unnecesarily days of work again! He doesn't know anything about action. I'm doing the action here. I'm working my ass off to get you fat jobs, fat money... The only big thing on this job was the mask girl. As fat as the other jobs before that? B..t. This is U-Gin, by the way. The four are inseparable since childhood. U-Gin isn't a gifted stuntman like the others... ...so he declared himself their manager. And that despite the fact that he really sucks concerning numbers. Are you serious? If Can continues to play diva, there'll be no more jobs! -"Diva"? We're the best! -But you're not professionals! If you were, you'd hold out your ass on the line and wait for it! -Are we whores? -Do I look like a pimp? -At least they get money. -As a beginner you get paid less. We've been starting up for six years now! Guys, we should stop this, we can't go on like that. By the way, I have something to tell you. Hi, baby. I'm coming home right now. I'll prepare some food. -Sorry, guys. -Phong, wait! I'll help searching. -For what? -Your balls, jackass! Funny! Come on, it wasn't that bad. -What did you want to tell us? -F..k it. -What's the matter with him lately? -No idea, man. Oh f..k, that late? I have to get to the office. S..t. The queen is the piece with the most liberties to move. She can move straight... ...or diagonally. But she has to decide on one move. If she leaves the chosen path... ...she gets unpredictable... ...and the king will deem her... useless. The car has arrived. -Hi, baby. -Hey, sweetie. Invitation To Jow Interview Yes! How are you two? Rad. -I think I'm hearing a heartbeat. -That's mine, you tool. -Really? That loud? -Yeah. You're the sickness, I'm the cure! You're the sickness, I'm the cure! -You're the sickness, I'm the... -Can! Can! Did you take the garbage out? Yes. Don't forget to get the garbage out. Okay, mum. -And then come and eat. -Okay! Are you posing in front of the mirror? Of course not! Yes, we have time for you tomorrow. Trust me, you're getting the best for this job. Yep. We'll be there tomorrow at 2 pm? Of course. All right. The hallway's gotta get cleaned up... No problem. Remember: We are the cleaners! Ciao! Fisher's Isle, tomorrow at 2pm. -Do a good job. -Am I supposed to do it all alone? Reel Deal Action Design, U-Gin on the phone, how can I help? Yes, that's right. Yes. I have the best stuntmen in town. For the smallest buck, if you get me. Yes... Today? Okay. One moment, I'll write it down. Okay. No, we'll be there. Yes. Thanks, bye! Nice! Private talks during working hours... -That's a pay cut. -What? If I take a breather, it's pay cut. If I have to pee, it's pay cut! Can I do something without a pay cut? If you don't like it... I can find some new idiot at anytime. -Yo! Bro? -Yo, chiller, what's up? -Yo. -Yes, I'm there in a sec! -Everything okay? -Yes. I got a nice casting call. -Really? -Yeah, let's meet up later. -Alright then. -See you later. Congratulations, you got lucky. Playing babysitter for Kopp. Babysitter? He's an old hand. -Had some bad luck. -Bad luck? Kopp is a loser. For years, he's been chasing this Gabriel. Some important files were missing and the case had to be closed. A lot of bad-mouthing from you guys over there. You know why he's been transferred here, right? He shot his partner. He was between him and a suspect. Three bullets into the leg, without batting an eye! -You know his nickname? -RoboKopp. So what? So what? He may have caught the suspect, but... ...his partner is getting disability pension. He's crazy. Take care he doesn't get you into the same s..t. See you. So... ...since we're forced to work with each other... ...we should talk straight. If you want to know something... just ask me. And this guy, who is about to ask my favourite question... ...would be my new partner: Is it true what Pl?ger says? That you shot your partner? If we two should ever get into the same situation... ...I'll show you how it all went down. At 4pm, your lives are gonna change. Can, you and your kebab! Next time we'll get Asian food. I don't like noodles, you know that. But they're healthier. Vegetables, low fat meat, fish. Stop babbling. I've got vegetables in here. It's healthy too. Are we here to exchange recipes? Should I get you into a cooking show? What's so urgent? Guys... I got you into a top casting! It's going to be a "top casting". Why don't you listen first? -It's for a German movie. -Do we get paid? It's more like a low-budget thing. Do you think I can pull the best jobs out of my ass? Is he being serious? Is he texting his lady? -Man, I gotta do some groceries. -S..t, who's eating all that? You're playing housewife now? Ulla is earning the money, I can at least do the groceries. What are you laughing at? Who's still living with mommy and gets his undies ironed? Fair. Okay guys, what's with the casting? If the casting is top as you say, I'm in. -Cool! -Nice. Guys, I'm out. I can't go on like this. What do you mean? How many castings do you want to do? How many of them did we already do and what did we acheive? It's over for me. It ain't over till it's over! Your Stallone quotes will be over too. I understand you. Let's just do it this one time! -Only one more time. -Come on. Yeah, come on. Come on! Come on! Come on! But so that you know - just this one time! -Let's meet in an hour! -I'm in. -Nice. -And you know what? I got a really nice idea! Sounds good! Wow. Are you serious! Are you going to a fancy dress-ball? Fancy dress-ball? -Bruce Lee. -Marty McFly. Cobretti. -Right -We've got something for you, too. -I'm not gonna wear this. -We're all in the same boat. -Forget it. -U-Gin, you're one of us, right? Just shut up and put on the jacket. Nice. Cool location. Hell of a job again. Hey. Don't give up just yet, blondie. We're not done yet. I already told you everything I know. If you're lying, you dirty little b..h... ...Gabriel's gonna get you back in little slices... ...like some f..g Serrano ham. Guys, we really gotta leave an impression. -Crap. -Chill, man. Trust me. No solos this time. Okay, what do you want to do? We are the sickness, you are... S..t. Sorry. Just a moment. Didn't I say "no solos this time? Are you ready? You're the sickness, we are the cure! Yo! We're Reel Deal Action Design. We got an appointment at 4pm. Cool location, huh? Boys! That's Eddy. What can be said about him? Crook, megalomaniac, and pretty crazy. And very ruthless. -Hey. -Shut up! -Did Gabriel send you? -Who? We... are here for the casting. Congratulations. You're about to play corpses. Seems like you idiots are in the wrong kind of movie. Roll credits. Kill them. No, wait. Eddy, come here... Super. The address is Neues Ufer 69 69, a very teasing number. It doesn't have anything to do with 96, except... Well... U-Gin and the numbers. -U-Gin, what did you do? -I'm sorry! They seem tough. Why not use that? Why gettting our hands dirty? And what if this b..h lied to us? Gabriel will come and kill us all. Let's be clever. Great. Listen up, you clowns. This sweet sobbing... ...chick here... ...is Gabriel's wife. She told us something very interesting. -Gabriel who? -Shut up. Don't you read the papers? He's on every headlines... He thinks he is the Tony Montana of Berlin. This Gabriel has got a safe with some cool s..t. And we want this cool s..t. Yes, Gabriel and his cool s..t. For 20 years I've been trying to put this guy behind bars. For 20 years this cool s..t has prevented that. In his safe was a whole archive of compromising documents... ...that he used to control his "business partners". Bankers, businessmen, politicians, prosecutors, etc. It didn't matter if he bought them or blackmailed them... ...everything went into that safe. And the ones not willing to play along... well... One thing was obvious... ...the safe would give anyone great power. But even with nobody knowing about it... ...Gabriel didn't just hide it in his bedroom... ...but at some secret place somewhere in the city. Yet his wife Victoria or his brother Aleksey... ...had to help him in a sudden arrest. For that, they needed access to the archive. This suspicious b..d didn't want to tell even them... ...he had created a system. He spread the coordinates and the safe code... ...to several secret locations that he controlled. To find the safe, you had to go from one location to the next. His wife and his brother only knew the first location. That way he was prepared for a case of need... ...and he made sure that nobody could come near it... ...without him knowing immediately. And what do you have to do with that? -We don't want to know. -Shut up! You will get me this cool s..t. -We won't do s..t for you. -Shut up. Is he gonna be a daddy? So sweet. A real daddy? You're becoming a father? I wanted to tell you the whole time. Dramatic enough, we're gonna keep him here. You do the job, then you'll get back your daddy. Cool deal, huh? If our sweet little b..h didn't lie to us... ...there are four spots somewhere in the city. At each spot there's hidden a part of the safe code... ...and a clue for the next spot. Like some f..g paper chase. On that paper are some numbers. They're called coordinates. Fascinating things. This is spot no.1. How do we know you don't play us? Sweetie... ...you will have to take that risk. -Man, we won't... -Shut your f..g mouth! You got time until 8am tomorrow. If you don't make it till then... ...he eats a bullet. If you talk to the police... ...he eats a bullet. And for one more stupid question... ...he eats a bullet. Lets go. -I wouldn't do that, big guy. -What you gonna do about it? You don't wanna know. Stop that s..t. Piss off already. Okay. "Come on, Cha, this one last time." Nice casting! I hope you're happy. -What do we do? -Of course we're going to the cops! Didn't you listen? Then Phong is f..d if we do that! Got a better idea, Cobretti? We do what we gotta do and get it over with. Hello, McFly, anybody home? They're gangsters don't trust them. -Do we have a choice? -I'm not risking Phong's life... ...so you can play Rambo. -It's not a movie, wake up! -What movie? Where is this loser Boris? Do something useful for a change. Keep an eye on them. Can is right. They'll be watching us. If we don't comply, they'll know and kill Phong. That's what I'm saying. Boys, believe me, we're making the mistake of our lives. We need a car. We are faster that way. Where do you wanna get one? Wanna steal one? U-Gin, nice job! Easy, wasn't it? Come on, bro. Great. U-Gin, if you want to get driving, now is the perfect moment. My car! That went well. He's gonna call the cops. We're collecting those clues and that's all. -It's a running errand. -Do we deliver pizza now? -Did I switched the house number? -Guys, chill. Where do we have to go first? -That's a cafe in Kreuzberg. -Anything else? The info is engraved on the handle of a... ...dagger? -What's a "cl?b"? -It's supposed to say "club". They wanna be left alone. I'm gonna go in there, play brother and that's it. Trust me. You don't get along with your brothers that well, huh? -Let your manager do that. -You wanna go in there? You could try and play sister. Watch and learn. What do you want, doofus? Seems to work. -He didn't cop one yet. -That guy from one minute ago... ...says you're all ugly, fat sons of b..s. Wait, wait. That's not all. The rank is coming. The chink that's with him said he f..d all your mothers. Yours... Maybe he's not such a bad manager. -Yours... -My words exactly. Not yours, but yours even twice. You know what, Cha? I always believed in him. You're dead, you b..s! Sons of donkeys! F..k it. Rad! -He's a crap manager! -Shut up and run. That way! -What's up? -Why are we running away? Don't make trouble, man. Come back. Boys, get lost. I wouldn't be that bold if I were you! Son of a dog. Get him. -Get over, I'm driving now. -What's wrong? Chill man. -What the hell did you tell them? -Me? Not a thing. Kopp. Got it. What's happened? Work to do. Kreuzberg. Hey, wait for me! Yeah, what? All right. You're lucky. Your boys make progress. Thanks for calling. -I thought that might interest you. -What does he mean? That's Gabriel's cafe. A neighbour reported a brawl with the guys from the cafe. The witnesses didn't see much. The guys in there aren't very talkative. Why didn't Gabriel have any clue about all that? He had some other things on his mind. His brother had Aleksey recently died under mysterious circumstances Gabriel treated him to a nice new home six feet under. Since women were not allowed... ...to gangster funerals... Gabriel had not yet noticed the kidnapping of his wife Victoria. Yes? Three guys, you say? You get beaten up by three guys, you losers? What did they want? You don't know? Let me tell you what I know! If Gabriel hears about that... ...he's gonna rip you a new one! And without knowing it, Lionid made a very dumb decision. You're lucky he doesn't have time for your s..t today. Losers... Three guys, you say? Interesting. Somebody is in an excellent form. And having unfinished business with Gabriel. They'll give you hell if you don't forget that Gabriel thing. And me too, by the way. What I don't understand... What kind of idiots want to mess with Gabriel? That went smoothly, huh? Smooth? Now we have to pick street fights. Die for nothing or live for something. You decide, Cha. Are you nuts? Can't you just take a picture? We're driving with a clue to Gabriel safe. Better safe than sorry. Besides, be happy we're advancing that well. Piece of crap! Everything all right, boys? You need help? -Good with cars? -Well he is. -Let me see. -It doesn't start anymore. I think it's the alternator. Let's push-start it. And give it some juice. Okay, guys. A little faster. Faster. Even a little more. Hang in there. More. Yeah! I've always thought I'd be dying on duty. Looks like the cholesterol gonna get me first. -When did you join? -20 years ago. Bad money, no time for family... ...my dream job. I know. At some point you're not even surprised... ...that you spent the night at the office again. What is Mrs Kopp say to that? Mrs Kopp... She's called Dombrowski again for five years now. Didn't they want to have a threesome with Gabriel? -Toilet? -Out of order. Wait. You're not getting in like that. -Why not? -This is a place with style. What? Can, you'd better wait outside then. Tie is mandatory. Give me yours. Your shades are f..g annoying. It's like a d..k on your face. Better a d..k on the face than no d..k at all, Minnie Mouse. Guys, the next clue is a heater. Let's check. Hey guys, how about a nice bottle of Petrus? We're sticking to beer. It's pretty boring here. -We should slip away. -Yes. -Stay for a while. -No, we're hitting it. Ciao. Guys. This place has no heater. Well, s..t.. What now? Let's check that door. Can and me go in there. You go to the bar and look out. Enjoy it. Have one for me. Not bad. Want to have a contest? Looks like I won. You're a natural... I can do alot of things with my mouth... Champagne. Got anything? Nothing. F..k, that's hot. Can you help me? You're the sickness, I'm... Okay, I've got it. Nice stuff. -Can you dance? -Can I dance? -Looks good. -Yeah. I told you this is not the rest room. What's your name? And one to the right, and... Did you have to ask for her name? Don't you see how she's looking? What's happening? We're getting beaten up by a woman. -I didn't get serious yet. Did you? -Not way! Want some more, wannabes? She looks angry. She's beautiful when she's angry What kinda group sex is that?! You wanted it that way. Three, two, one. Hey, give me the bill. Come back, you... That's mine. Cunts. Watch out. It's okay. Taxi. Get out. Well, cuties, where do you want to go? Just drive. At least give back the ties, jerks. B..s. F..g hell, we're out of beer. -You morons forgot to buy some. -We can go to the gas station. I'll do it myself. You always buy this mixed s..t. -Hey, I got to piss. -Suck it up. -I can piss right here if you want. -You're f..g annoying me. Take this sissy to the loo. Great. How am I supposed to do like that? Or do you want to hold it? You are gonna need both hands. I can't when someone's watching. -What? -I can't when someone's watching. Are you s..g me? Do you think I want to see your d..k? Don't try to f..k with me, asshole! You sucker, I'll get you. Then I'm gonna f..k you until you love me! Stop! Whoa! Stop! Stop! Nice! Thanks. You won't believe what happened. I already know this story. And the ending is pretty s..y. To Aleksey! If you would like to follow me now, please. Oh s..t. I hate these dogs. What? That's good luck. Maybe you're heading to good times. Funny. That's also one of Gabriel's joints, isn't it? -Coincidence? -I don't think so. Somebody is systematically trying to piss off Gabriel. A rival? I can't imagine anyone being so dumb. Plus... Plus what? Gabriel has a lot of enemies, everywhere. Despite that, this scum seems to be untouchable. So he has a lot of assholes in his claws, or he bought them. These assholes're sitting in chairs everywhere and cover his back. They're in our chairs, too. You wanna tell me that Gabriel's got his hands in our pie? Why do you think my case went down the drain? How has there been a trial then? When they arrested Gabriel's brother... ...for a silly thing, I got hold of him. Pathetic wimp. Not at all like Gabriel. I told him what they do to handsome boys like him in prison. And then I had him. I had him ready to testify against his own brother. You had a grip on Gabriel's brother? Well... A chance like that occurs only once in a lifetime. Yes? To f..k up. Verb, transitive. Definition: to conclude something without success; ...to execute something extremely bad... Not telling Gabriel that three guys f..k up his joints. I'm happy we've reached an agreement. In the middles ages it was current to behead the bearer for bad news. Pretty excessive. I wonder what they did if, additionally... ...those bad news were delivered too late? Remind me to look that up on occasion. I'd really love to know that. You're sure it's the same three guys? Yes... and also this pig is snooping around again. Kopp? The guy is a real bloodhound. Let him do the dirty work, so he's busy. Okay. And? What now? Well... It looks like only two guys can keep up with Gabriel. God and Superman. So you don't have a clue. No, Schulz. I don't have a goddamn f..g clue. Have you ever thought about quitting? Yeah. As soon as Gabriel is thrown into... ...the deepest s..e on this planet. And that s..e into an even deeper s..e. Yes? The three guys you're looking for... ...I know where they'll appear again. But you don't want to tell me who you are? Someone wants to serve us our three guys on a silver platter. Let's go, then. -Keep the change. -Thanks. Isn't it too late for a visit? Take my card and give me a call if you need me later. What visit? Okay, the next hint is "Frederick Krueger". Who the hell is that? No clue man. But he has to be somewhere beyond this wall. How do we get him to the other side? Cha. Cha, I love you. Where is Can? Be quiet. You're my bros. I know, but you stay here and shut your mouth, okay? I'm sorry, guys. I've been a s..y manager. Yeah, it's true. From now on I'll get you the best jobs, okay? If you shut your trap now, you still get to be our manager. -Okay? -Okay. -You guys are the hottest s..t. -Thanks. You do this kung fu stuff and all... Bruce Lee, I can do nothing against you. What in the name of my tiny yellow balls. F..k, man. I hate cemeteries. Stop feeling me up. Are you afraid? What? Never. I gotta piss. Ever heard about ghost stories? What ghost stories? The ones about the White woman at the cemetery. She drags people into the graves at night. You're s..g me. When have I ever done that? She's real, man. S..t. Back there. -What, where? -Over there. I don't see anything. Ha, ha, very funny. You got it going. -Look, the gravestone. -S..t. Search it. The hint should be somewhere around. Are you done? Can we leave now? I got it. -Where's U-Gin? -Wasn't he here? How could we find him in this darkness? Don't know. Maybe he should smile. F..k, what was that? No idea, man. But it comes from back there. -Go have a look. -Go look yourself. Untie him, you goddamn freaks. Those are my bros coming for me. Are you done? Cha and Can. My bros. I love you, guys. What the hell is that? I think he wants you. Man, kick his ass. He wants some? I'll give him some. You can't do s..t. -Come on, Cha! -Come on. Give him hell. I thought this guy was hardcore. He is a total pussy. Yeah, let's go back to the anarchist black bloc. No. If you want the hardcore guys... ...we should join the Republican Youth. I told you the stories about the white woman were true. Wasn't that a guy? What the hell, man? Can we get outta here, please? I think he liked you. You're so damn funny. You've got a nice butt, though. Pull yourself together man or somebody's gonna call the cops. Well, guys... ...having fun? Listen up, you clowns. This tour de f..k-up of yours... ...has maybe won you some fans. But you've also broken some laws. Assault and battery in 24 cases. Property damage. Car theft. And your mummies won't like this one... You forgot to pay for the bubbly at the strip club. So let's be clear. We can get your asses in jail. So how about you start singing? Separate interrogations. Spit it out. What was your business at the cemetery? -What about the strip club? -And those thugs at the cafe? -Are you just three or more? -For whom are you working for? What do you know about Gabriel? Hello. You look ripped, dude. Do you work out? Solly, me no speak German. Me no from here. That's a tight beard you sporting. Trimmed. Sweet. Me get up from bed, call Can in telephone. And your partner totally looks like Al Pacino. Me no fight. No like hurt. Do you know those guys "Starsky & Hutch"? Do you know them? Not from here. Did I tell you I'm having difficulties sleeping? That's why I stay up all night nowadays. I'm having trouble with the old lady. I'll be staying overnight. We've got all night for this. We've got all night. But you don't, right? Your crusade against Gabriel started today, whatever the reason. Mine has been going for 20 years now. You and me, we want the same thing, don't we? All right, I'll tell you everything. Let's not waste anytime. Send out the SWAT team. God, my head. S..t! What do we do now? Hey, Cha. Did you tell them anything? I told them where the casting office is. You did what? Did you think you could f..k me over? Yeah, what? Where are you? The cops? And why didn't you call earlier? You wanted to wait that the boys leave the station, you f..d? If you come here again, I'm gonna rip you a new face... ...dirty a..e! Let's go guys, we gotta split. -What about these two? -S..t! -Shoot them dead and then go. -Hey, boss. -I'll take care of it. -Even better. Hands up! Chill out. I told them where the casting was held... -...not where Phong is. -Huh? Are you kidding me? Who called you? Get out of here, f..g bums! You mess up the floor! I just mopped it! Idiots! You're bums! Why? The cops might've saved Phong. I don't think so. When I told those two about Gabriel, they got all fidgety. They didn't care about Phong. Everybody just wants to lay a finger on that safe. Oh, Eddie. You never marvel who might've spread rumors about Gabriel's safe? You think it was by chance that my new partner... ...came up with the idea of kidnapping me? On the one day that Gabriel would be at the funeral? You've been lying to me the whole time, you wimp! But when you found some suckers... ...you could blackmail into doing your work. I was mildly surprised. But see... Eddy... ...you are my sucker. Then again, it's not your fault. Your brain seems to be even smaller than your d..k. I swear to you, you thunder cunt... ...if I ever lay my hands on you... ...I'm going to slice off your tits... ...and feed them to the troll that shat out your grandma! Shut up. What about this one? How can they get the codes if we still have the dagger? Okay. They need Phong alive. I think we might still need him. So what now? I haven't thought about that yet. Guys... This whole time we were chasing the hottest jobs and the fat money. I know what you can do. This time it's not about money or fame. It's about helping our brother, getting together again. The problem is, we don't have the fourth part of the combination yet. Guys, we're family, right? Besides... ...problems are there to solve them. -For Phong. -For Phong. For Phong. Yeah? Thanks for the heads-up. They tricked us. Those boys are not as stupid as they look. -Dude, I got to puke. -Again? Yeah, I'm f..d. -Okay, we'll go ahead. -I'll catch up. Hello? All right. We're on our way. Sorry. My wife always keeps worrying when I'm gone for the night. We'll get to the bottom of this now. Let's take the back entrance. A statue... in this place? I don't know. Let's start looking. Let me handle this. You wanna play brother now? Thank you for your welcome. We wouldn't bother you if it wasn't really important. We're Archaeology students... ...and would like to take a look at your precious statue. We're writing a thesis about the Imperial period... ...when the emperors were alive, etc. Anyway, we really care about your culture... ...since it happened about 100 years ago. What's she saying? No clue. I'm Korean. You should know that by now. -What kind of Asian are you? -Don't know. Okay. Plan B? What? -You can't do this. -Sure I can. This went fast, didn't it? Archaeology students? Really? Come on. Hey, I got something for you. You got it going on. Here, I didn't need those. Not any more maybe. Phong? You guys got something I want. She's after the goddamn safe too. Your decision. You still don't understand, This whole thing is way over your heads. Now hand over the coordinates. Bravo. A grand move. I see you've learned to write the rules to your own game. You really thought I'm just a pawn... ...you can move around on your chessboard? Like you did with your brother? We have to do something or the boys are f..d. Kopp, they're too many. We're responsible for them. You know... ...I've always expected... ...some scumbag to reach out for my archive. You being the one is... ...almost interesting. But to be honest, you bore me. Call for backup. I'll try and hold them up. This is suici... Police! Everybody stay calm. Now it's getting interesting. Did you tell her how your brother died? What does he mean? Sweetie, are you really that gullible? Like I said, lousy pay. Did I ever tell you how the story about my old partner ended? He was a corrupt asshole, just like you. If you got something to say, do it! Did you really think Gabriel would let my key witness... ...against him live? Guess you've lost sight of one thing. This is still my game. You've lost sight of something too. Your brother wasn't only a better person than you... ...he also f..d better. Finish them! Phong! Get her. Kick his ass, Can! I told you it was a bad idea. -You still alive? -I'm all right. -Go help Phong. -Sure? -You okay? They've gone this way. -Yeah. Enough of that! You look beat. Phong. What are you doing here? You're all so stupid. Over there! Child's play is over. My game, my rules. Die for something or live for nothing. Your choice. Your move. Dead or alive, you're coming with me. Yippie-ki-ay, m..r. Are you okay? The bullet went right through don't worry. We've got something for you. Phong, in her pocket. -Cha, are you all right? -I'm alright. What about you? Yeah. About time we got rid of this s..t. And these are the coordinates. I know this. It's a colony of arbours at the airport. There's additional info. C13. Guess it's the plot number. Guys, there's something left for me to do. I'll send somebody down. And... ...good work, guys. Think about it... All this time I couldn't get hold of this pig and his minions... ...and then I got hold of Gabriel's archive. And with this archive... ...I would bust the whole rest of this corrupt slime. If you wanna know how a happy b..d looks like... ...just watch me. I guess that's about it. What can I say? After 20 years of rowing up s..t creek without a paddle... ...within a day these boys showed what it all comes down to. They sticked together... ...listened to their hearts and stayed true to themselves. Until the end. You didn't expect me to quote "Die Hard", did you? Here, you deserve to get them back. Those b..s. I'm so f..g hungry. I'd even eat kebab. Hey, Phong, were you crying earlier on? What? He's right. You really had watery eyes. Guys, never! He thought we wouldn't get him out. -Honestly, did you cry? -Yeah, sure. My battery's dead. So what? This story is our chance to get rich. I have to find us a production company real quick. Over my dead body, man. What? It can't get any worse than this. Yeah, man, come on. -I'm done with this, boys -Come on, man. Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Lick my tiny yellow balls. Thanks. Look at me. Danke. Your shades are f..g annoying... It's like... A little louder, please. Guys, take it easy. Where do we... Where do we... Where do we... Where do we... have to go anyway? Where do we have to go? Why did you laugh? -That's my part, Can. -Oh, sorry. Can's right. -Can we start again? -Yeah, it's rolling. I mean... he's gotta chill. If Can continues playing the diva... Again please. Do you think I'm looking at your d..k? Don't try to f..k with me, hurry up! 121-11, take 1. If Gabriel learns about that, he's gonna... ...rip your ass. He's gonna give... He's gonna... If I ever lay my hands on you... ...I'm going to slice off your grandma's ti... ts... On two conditions.. First... ...I forgot. Cut! What happened? S..t! "You're the sickness, I'm the cure". Yeah.
