(wind whooshing) (wings flapping) (dramatic drumbeat music) (tense music) (knocking) - Danny, Beth. - Captain Brooks? - Yes. - Thank God. We thought you'd never get here. - [Captain Brooks] Do you have the others? - Where are you taking us? (gasps) - No. (gunshot booms) - Danny. (gunshot booms) Ah! (gunshot booms) (dramatic music) (moaning) Danny. - I'm sorry, he's gone. - Take care of them. - Them? (dramatic music) (typewriter keys clacking) (big band music) (buzzing) - Yes, General? - [General Over Speaker] Send in Brooks. - Captain Brooks, you can go in now. - Well, a day late and a dollar short up until now, wouldn't you say? - Sir? - Your performance on this assignment? - Yes, sir. - Says here you've been in trouble before. Combat fatigue? - Yes, sir. - Well, I guess that's none of my business, and I'm stuck with you now. - Yes, sir. - You looked in that trunk, didn't you? - Yes, sir. Some sort of uh, fancy backroom boy stuff. - No, Captain, that's no fancy backroom boy stuff. - Well then, sir, I have no idea what the hell's going on here. - Frankly Captain, neither do I, but lucky for the both of us, that's what orders are for. - Yes, sir. (big band music) (buzzing) - [General Over Speaker] Send in Ivanov. - Yes, General. - [Secretary] You may go in now. - Ma'am. (mysterious music) (chuckles) - What is this, sir? We startin' a sideshow or something? - Captain Brooks, Dr. Ivan Ivanov. - Doctor of what exactly? - Theology. - God knows that'll come in handy. - He does. - Is that a German accent, Doc? - Russian. Definitely not German. - You know, they keep tellin' us that the Russians are our pals, now. Well, at least that's what they keep tellin' us. - I supposed trust is hard to come by, Captain, even here in America. - Alright, alright, enough. Have a seat. Listen up. Here's the lowdown. Now, we have it on good intelligence that the Axis has a special unit investigating, okay, magic. - I'm sorry. (chuckling) Did you say magic? - You heard me. Mindreading, voodoo, call it what you like. Like these damn puppets, and they've been getting results. So get that look off your face, Captain. - Sorry, sir. - Now, Captain, Dr. Ivanov here has been put in charge of our own Allied Special Projects Unit by men with a lot more stars than I got, and the first job is to find out how these puppets work. - Well yes, sir, if you so say. - Oh, I say so. Yes, sir, I do say so Captain. Take a look. Now the Nazis have their own puppets and these are American citizens that these things have killed along with one of our own generals. They're probably planning more fifth column stuff as we speak, so I don't want any more "Yes, sirs" outta you. I got my orders and now you got yours, and by the way, from here on in, you're taking orders from the dwarf. Dismissed. - Let's go Captain. (dramatic music) (ominous music) - [Gerde] Herr Freuhoffer. - [Krabke] Is this your doing, Frau Doktor? - [Gerde] My doing? Sturmbanfuhrer Krabke. - I told you we needed him alive. What happened to him? - Nothing to do with me. Simply died of old age. Natural causes. It does sometimes happen, even in wartime. - What about the Chinatown facility? It's nuts. - Destroyed, but all is not lost. We have this, and we have these. It seems Herr Freuhoffer was making some much needed repairs when he um, met his maker. - You can control them? - Of course. This green liquid gives them life, but they need more than life. They need a master. Like men. They shall. - Frau Doktor? (eerie chime music) - He's here. - Who is? - A very dangerous woman, one I've met before. Come. We must hurry. - So, my little friend. We will finish our business. We must work quickly. They have found an old master. - Very well, Frau Doktor. Show me what they can do. What you can do. (tense music) - I'm telling ya, George, I think I heard something. - You're always hearing something. Will you come over here and give me a hand? - No, I'm sure this time. - You're always sure, Bobby. - I'll be back in a sec. - [George] Come on, Bobby. (tense music) - [Bobby] I think I see something over here. - Yeah, yeah. (ominous music) Bobby, you okay? Bobby? (thudding) - Ah! (screaming) (buzzing) (dramatic music) (gunshots booming) - [Frau Doctor] Very good (speaking foreign language). Now, attach the bombs where I told you, and come back to your master. (tense music) (booming) (somber music) (gasps) (hissing) - Father. - Don't be afraid, Elisa. He's a friend. - A friend? He's alive. A living puppet. Father, I dreamed about others like him. - Later, my dear. Hurry now. Get dressed. - Something's happened. - Half the city's gone dark. I've called a meeting. (eerie music) We'll have to work on you, my friend. (eerie music) Captain, Miss Georgina Vale. - Ma'am. - My, my. An officer and a gentleman. - My daughter, Elisa. - Your, I'm sorry, your daughter? Good evening, miss. - Good evening. - Yes, Captain. We can have children of conventional size. May we proceed? - You're the boss, Doc. - Thank you. Elisa, Miss Vale. Captain Brooks will be serving as a liaison to the war department. All three of us, Miss Vale, my daughter and I have certain special abilities that have made us suitable for membership in this organization. - Yes, sir. - Miss Vale is our resident expert in the occult and an accomplished witch. (chuckles) - Right. - She specializes in sexual magic. - Do tell. - Don't we all? - My daughter, Elisa, is a psychic and clairvoyant. That means-- - I know what it means. It means she can tell the future, like a fortune teller or a fortune cookie. - Something like that, but only in her dreams. - How 'bout you, Doc? What's your trick? Can you tell me what I'm thinking right about now? - I'm afraid I can't read minds, Captain, but I can sense emotions. Anger, fear, love. I can project them as well. For instance, I can paralyze a man with fear. - So can a .45 automatic or a bunch of wind up... - Freaks? - Yeah. - My friends. You have to forgive the captain. He seems angry, but underneath I'm sensing something else. Fear. (chuckling) - You think I'm afraid of all this? Your little spook show you're running here? - Oh, no, Captain. I'm sensing something else. A deeper fear, very deep. Something you've been carrying around for some time, like a bad tooth. I can extract it if you like. - Let's just stick to business, hmm? - Very well. Elisa. - I saw three of them down underground surrounded by machines, I think. One of the them was all metal, like a tank. Another one was like a werewolf in a Nazi uniform, and a third one was a woman with machine guns for breasts. They planted the bombs. - Okay. So, you're tellin' me things like these blacked out half the city? - There was somebody else. A shadow behind them, guiding them. No one's shadow, very powerful. A master. Father. It was her. (ominous music) (vocalizing in foreign language) (grunting) - Who is this, anyway? (choking) - [Thomas] What do you want from me? Stop! - Thomas Otterman. Sounds German, is he one of ours? - Hmm? Oh, no. No one in particular. Just someone to practice on. Now I think red hot needles under the fingernails, hmm? (screaming) - [Thomas] Stop! Ah! - Ah! So, your puppets damaged the substation to black out the city for a few hours. No more than any one of our agents could have done. By morning everything be back to normal, but now I think the teeth, yah, yah. The teeth. (screaming) - I can't say that you've impressed me, Frau Doktor, but I'm nothing if not a reasonable man. (grunting) Do convince me. (screaming) (ominous music) - [Thomas] Stop! - Did you know, Frau Doktor that the most common nightmares involve the breaking of teeth? Teeth being shattered, pulled out? - No, Sturmbanfuhrer, I did not know that. - Yah, it's true. Damage to the fingers, the eyes, the nose I find is most fascinating. (wailing) - Perhaps after the war is over you should write a paper on it. - When the war is over? Some would consider that a naive position, Frau Doktor, but please, go on talking about your puppets. - Yes, of course. Sturmbanfuhrer Krabke, there are things my puppets can do. - Your puppets? - Our puppets. There are things our puppets can do that not even an army can. - Really? You should find this interesting. Observe the eyes. (wailing) The roots of the eyes are most sensitive, Frau Doktor, most sensitive. - [Thomas] Let me die! (crying) - You were saying? - My pup, our puppets can do many things. For example, they can climb up the side of buildings, through ventilation shafts. They can even assassinate a prime minister, a president, even a fuhrer. Herr Krabke, our adversaries have their own puppets, their own elixir. They may even have the secret to making more, more puppets, more elixir and what's more to the point is they have found an old master. Someone I have met before. He is not to be underestimated. We must act before they do. - This one's about used up. - No, Sturmbanfuhrer, I may have some use for him, if you don't mind. - Not at all, Frau Doktor, and I see your point about the other puppets. What is your plan? - Oberhelfer Steitze! - Yah, Frau Doktor? Fetch the (speaking foreign language). - Yah, Frau Doktor. - She has no special power? - No, but she and her girls have their uses. - Yah. (ominous music) (thudding) - France yet again at Germany's feet. Seems so natural, Madame Longpre. Herr Krabke, Madame Longpre is one of the world's preeminent scholars of the occult and France's most renowned psychic. - Is that so? - Yes. Madame Longpre helped us locate the two Americans who were hiding Toulon's puppets. She stole the information right from the mind of General Hansard, isn't that right, Madame Antoinette? - Yes, Frau Doktor. - Really? And how do you keep secrets from such a creature? You think she was dangerous? (chuckles) - My dear Antoinette? No, not dangerous at all. A dog who has been trained properly is not dangerous. Isn't that right, Antoinette? - Yes, Frau Doktor. - Nothing pleases the eye more than the sight of a properly beaten bitch. Come, Antoinette, send out your powers. Search for the puppets. Where are they? Who has them? Seek, Antoinette, seek. (eerie chime music) - So, upstairs is secure. What the hell are you doing? Showing yourself like that in front of a young girl? - Captain, leave Miss Vale alone, please. She's making her own arrangements to protect the house. - What, by showing off her-- - Leave her alone, please. - And I have seen women's breasts before, Captain, but thank you for your concern. - You're welcome. So what is all this? - I found it hidden in Toulon's trunk. I believe it is the scroll of Osiris. The secret of the elixir by which the dead can be dowried life. Unfortunately, I can't read it. The hieroglyphics are too ancient, unless I use some of this. This is all we have left to keep our friends alive. Our enemies, no doubt, have even less. They'll be coming for this and this, unless we conceal ourselves. - Okay, so this crowd thing we're talking about. - Gerde Ernst, Doktor Gerde Ernst. - Right. So, her and the rest of them. They're looking for us and we're looking for them. Meanwhile, they're hiding from us and we're hiding from them. You know, back in the day, my dad used to call that a stalemate. - Yes, yes, I suppose it is for now. She can't read minds Captain, but she has someone who can. They'll be searching for us, for anyone in the city who's thinking about us, about this place. Put this around your neck, Captain. - What is it? - It's an elder sign. There are ways to protect us so long as we stay inside these walls to shadow us. These will do the same when we go outside. - Okay, you say they're trying to look for us, right? Why don't we do the same thing? I mean, use some of this voodoo stuff to try to find them. - We spent most of the night trying without success. No doubt Frau Ernst has shrouded their hiding place in much the same way that we have, but we do have an advantage. Magic leaves a psychic trace behind. If we can find the site of sabotage, Georgina can track them to their base, but we need you to find out where the bombs were planted. - Okay. I'm on it. (ominous music) - You like this? - Oh, yah, I like it. Like it, cupcake. - Close your eyes, big boy, and I'll give you a big surprise. Ah ah, no peeking. Close those eyes tight. (chuckling) (mysterious music) You can open your eyes now. (dramatic music) Ah! (screaming) - Ah! (screaming) - Go and get the man. (bubbling) (ominous music) Yes, this time I've got it. You see? We can duplicate the Freuhoffer-- (crashing) (ominous music) - You were saying, Frau Doktor? (eerie chime music) - You're up late Captain. - So are you, Miss Ivanov. Coffee? - No, thanks. I just had a dream about you. - Oh yeah? Should I be flattered? - I saw you in the battle, wounded, hiding under the bodies of your comrades, the Germans firing into the bodies. - Who told you about that? - I told you, I just dreamed about it. That's where you got the scar. - What else? - Nothing. Is there anything else? - Yeah, I don't suppose you dreamed about me being shipped stateside for combat fatigue, which is a nice way of saying I cracked up. - It's nothing to be ashamed of, Captain. - You tell that to my friends and the men who were over there dying for our country while I'm sitting here babysitting a bunch of... (creaking) I guess I just wasn't tough enough. - It's very strange. - What is? - How much you and my father are alike. - Oh, wow, really? That just made my day. - Strong men, men confident in their power, who've never had to face a failure. It's not easy, is it? My father wouldn't talk about my mother. We don't even have a picture of her. - What happened to her? - We were captured, my father, my mother and I, by a special unit of the Gestapo while my father was lecturing in Leipzig. They were looking for the people with exceptional abilities, rounding them up. This woman, she had great power like my father. This dreadful woman. - The one that we're looking for now? - Yeah. She's quite a fool, really. She imagines she'll have a special place in the new world order. The Nazis are only using her and others like her. If they were to win, there'd be no place for people like her, like us. We're freaks. (knocking) (ominous music) What is it? - Go get your father. (knocking) Who is it? - Courier from Central Command. - Let me see your credentials. (ominous music) - Captain Brooks. I have your reports from my department. (mysterious music) - I've got them. I've got them. - According to this, the bomb was planted here. Substation 212. - What about the damage, Captain? Can we get in there? - I don't know. Corporal. - Well, sir, repair crews rerouted the juice, so the whole station shut down. The thing is, I heard the feds have been all over that place and they didn't find nothin', so I don't know what you think you're going to find. - You don't have to worry, angel. I'll take care of that. - Yes, ma'am. - Elisa, I wish for you to remain here. - But Father, I... Yes, Father. - Chester, Pinhead. You'll remain here, as well. - You know what Doc? I think we should bring the corporal here with us, as well. - Very well. Georgina, give him an elder sign. - What's an elder sign? - Just put it around your neck. I'll explain later. - Oh, don't bother, sir. I'm an enlisted man. (eerie music) (ominous music) (creaking) (gasping) Captain. Captain Smith, just what is that there woman doing with that chicken foot? - Shhh, she's searching for a trace of the ones who were here before. If she finds it, we should be able to follow it, too. (crackling) - Ah! Doctor, we must leave here at once. (ominous tense music) (speaking foreign language) Mein Frau. Where are they, little man? Come now, no surprises. It won't help you. Bring them out, little man. (tense music) Down, make them all lie down on the floor. That's better. You've met my associate, Frau Doktor, but I don't believe we've had the pleasure. I am Sturmbanfuhrer Krabke. They say you're very powerful Herr Ivanov, and old master. Was you trying to send something in my direction? Some kind of attack? (chuckling) Yes, Herr Ivanov, fear can be a very powerful weapon. (whimpering) Those quaint charms. You're all wearing elder signs. An effective defense, but they don't seem to work against me. I draw my powers from a more ancient well. You know this mark, the mark of the old gods, the first gods. But what you failed to fight against this, what need have I of Frau Gerde and her puppets? I'll make you all dance to my strings. You dare challenge me? A dwarf! (speaking foreign language) (moaning) Two citizen soldiers. (moaning) Should I start with you, old master? No, no I don't think so. I don't think that would be a fair test. Little body too weak. The mind too strong I'll hunt you for scientific purposes. We should choose a more typical specimen. You'd like to send them against me, wouldn't you? (chuckling) But I have my own blades, my own (mumbles), my own (mumbles). Here. (tense music) Stand up, please. - Kiss my ass, you kraut son of a-- (slaps) - That's better. Nice and quiet. Now, what was I saying? Oh, yes, I know a man be driven mad from fear, but can a man die from fear alone? Shall we find out? (moaning) So many nerves, so hard to find them all. See them, tweak them! (moaning) Twisting them. (speaking foreign language) (choking) (dramatic music) Excellent. Oh, oh but I'll be tired. Oh, it would be so much easier if I didn't have to control you all. (tense music) - The scroll. The scroll of Osiris. - The dwarf. He was studying it at this table, but she doesn't know where it is now. (thuds) I swear, Frau Doktor. - Frau Doktor. - Hmm? (tense music) - Frau Doktor, I've got it. - No, wait! (gunshots booming) (gasping) Fool. (mysterious music) (dramatic music) (gasping) (tense music) These puppets of Toulon's, they are harder to control than ours. Not like the (speaking foreign language). Come. Let's see if the illustrious Sturmbanfuhrer has had more luck finding the father than we have had here. (dramatic music) (tense music) - Anxious to join your friend, soldier? But a bit later. Perhaps I should try a specimen of the inferior sex. Und inferior race. (moaning) (speaking foreign language) (tense music) Ah! (screaming) (crackling) (buzzing) (wailing) (dramatic music) (footsteps clacking) - [Georgina] Have courage, mon cherie. - She was here. She leaves her psychic trace behind. I can sense it like the odor of decay. - There's no sign of Elisa. I searched the whole house. - Yes. I could feel the emptiness as soon as we arrived. They have her. Gerde and (mumbling) Krabke! They have her. - They also took Pinhead. There's no sign of him. - Yes, I know. - Doctor, what are we going to do about Elisa? I mean, if they... - Captain, what can any of us do? Pray that God gives us strength to bear whatever trials He sends us, if we must. (tense music) - [Friede] Do you wish to revive it? - No, there's not enough elixir for experiments, though there are possibilities. Be of good cheer, Fraulein Steitze. - I am always cheerful Frau Doktor. - Indeed. - Of course. The Fuhrer expects all young German women to be cheerful at all times. - Does he really? - Indeed, Frau Doktor. Cheerful and useful. - Well, Oberhelfer Steitze, you're truly one remarkable monster. - Thank you, Frau Doktor. (tense music) - How are you feeling, Sturmban Freuhoff? - If you (mumbling) I can let you experience the pain firsthand. - No, thank you Herr Krabke. I was just being polite. - You're very lucky, Frau Doktor. - How so? - My own failure this evening makes it impossible for me to condemn you for yours. - Well, it's hardly necessary, but I won't fail again. (dramatic music) (eerie music) - Why don't we just destroy this thing? - For the last 4,000 years, Captain, far wiser men than you or I could have destroyed this scroll. If they chose to preserve it instead, then perhaps we should defer to that wisdom. (muffled radio chattering in foreign language) - This is the dwarf's daughter? - Yes. Pretty little bit of bait, isn't she? - Let's hope she brings in the big fish. (tense music) (gasps) Welcome fraulein. (knocking) (ominous music) - What does it say? - They want the rest of the elixir, the puppets, the scroll and me. In return, Elisa will be released unharmed. If not-- - You don't believe them, do you? - Of course not, but we must do something. - Doctor, look. (tense music) It's hair. Just a single strand. Not from the woman doctor. It belongs to the one who left the message. Still something I can work with. - And this is something we can work with to better protect us all. (tense music) (dramatic music) (groaning) - So, they tell me you can dream the future, hmm? (crying) Did you dream of your own death? The death of your freakish father? All these decadent cities in flames, hmm? - Yes. Yes. I dreamed of cities in flames. Dresden. Munich. Berlin, the whole damn thousand years Reich in flames. Oh, and something else. I saw bunkers, stinking old ratty. A rat called, ah! - Silence! - Herr Krabke! That is enough. - What did you say? - We need her. For now, let her be. - Frau Doktor, you forget yourself. I am the officer in charge of this station. - Yes, yes, Sturmbanfuhrer, of course. - Frau Ernst! (tense music) - Herr Krabke. I want you to understand that I do respect your exceptional abilities and I appreciate our superior's choice to put you in command of this station. (moaning) You must understand that rank and title are not the same as the aristocracy of nature. I hope you didn't think that the scribblings on your chest would protect you from me. They protected you from Herr Ivanov but not so. They did not protect you from his powers, only from his scruples. Some weakness in the man that prevents him from crushing another man's soul. - You are nothing but a traitor! If you harm me-- - Herr Krabke. I very much want us to have a productive relationship but you must understand what that relationship is. (wailing) You prattle on of old gods, first gods. This hand, it held the first stone knife that cut the heart out of the first child, sacrificed to the first darkness that crawled up out of the chaos of the long night. The darkness that has no name. The great shadow that cast you and I and the Fuhrer in all the terrible workings of the world. (moaning) I have seen the captives fed to the flames at the mighty temples of Murdoch and I have seen ten thousands of heads of the slain piled at the gates (mumbles). Oh, the things I have seen. Come. (moaning) Go ahead. (moaning) When you have passed through as many lives as I have, when you have died as many deaths as I have, you will learn that one has infinite ways to inflict pain, and it is the knife to the soul that cuts the deepest. Enough. Herr Krabke, speak, but choose your words wisely. Do we understand each other? - Yah, Frau Doktor. - Now go and get yourself cleaned up. Our guests will be arriving any minute. (tense music) Are you ready, Fraulein Steitze? - Yah, Frau Doktor. - Any thoughts, Fraulein Steitze on what just happened between myself and the Sturmbanfuhrer? - I never involve myself in disputes of my superiors. I simply follow orders to the best of my ability. (ominous music) - They are protected, Doctor, like Krabke. (tense music) (dramatic music) (hissing) - Ah! (screaming) (dramatic music) (ominous music) (mumbling) - Wait. They know we're here. (tense music) - Please. Please. Please help me. - I'm sorry. I can't. There is nothing we can do. We can't win. - That's not true. Read my mind, my dream. Please. - Antoinette! - Yes, Frau Doktor? - Well, where are they? - I don't know. I can't find them. They must be enshadowed. Protected. - Antoinette. Antoinette, are you lying? - I swear. I swear I'm not lying. I'll keep trying. I'll keep trying. (tense music) (gunshots booming) (dramatic music) - Georgina, get downstairs. I'll cover you. - So, you did not know they were here? I guess some dogs can never be properly trained. Weremutt, kill her. (dramatic music) (screaming) (crying) (clicking) (gunshots booming) (thudding) (moaning) (dramatic music) - Ah! (choking) - [Man] You trying to trick me? - No, no, no, please. (dramatic music) Now put your head back. Close your eyes. Now open your mouth. Yes, yes. Now, you are about to be kissed like you've never been kissed before. (tense music) (choking) (gunshots booming) (dramatic music) - Let's get outta here, Doc. Come on, this way. (dramatic music) (gunshots booming) (tense music) - Is that you, little one? (chuckling) (whirring) (dramatic music) (screaming) (speaking foreign language) - Ah! (dramatic music) (screaming) - Herr Doctor. - Frau Doktor. - Still struggling to control mere bits of wood and metal? - There's so much more to mere wood and metal. They have souls, and I've never tried to control them, only to guide them. - Yes, that's always been your weakness. Not wanting to tamper with the soul. It's why you couldn't save your wife. It's why you cannot save your daughter. (tense music) - Oh. I'm glad you've come back, Americana. (grunts) I won't kill you, not just yet. I want you to see what I'm going to do to the girl. (grunting) (ominous music) - Always been one of your weaknesses. You care too much. But to me, wood, metal, flesh, spirit, man, puppet all the same. I use them and when I no longer need them, I throw them away. I have no need of armies, fuhrers, (speaking foreign language). They're just layers of skin that I shed as I grow ever larger, lifetime after lifetime. I know the elixir is almost gone. Where is the scroll, little man? If you cannot read it, I can. Answer me! You know which one of us is stronger. (tense music) Very well. Let's do this my way. (chuckling) (tense music) - Stupid Americana, why won't you stay down? - That's right. I'm a stupid American. (grunting) You don't know when to quit. You don't know when to lay down. We're so dumb, we're just gonna keep coming and coming until we roll over fuckin' Berlin. (thuds) - Oh! (screams) (dramatic music) (speaking foreign language) (choking) (crunching) - Where is the scroll, little man? Tell me. Tell me. Think of your daughter. Think of what I'll do to her. You dare? Kill him. Kill him! - I've never tried to control them, only to guide them. (gunshots booming) (dramatic music) Enough, my friends. (whirring) Please. - [Elisa] Father. - [Ivan] Elisa. - I wasn't frightened, Father. I knew you would come. I saw it in my dream. - Thank heavens. What about Krabke? - Burning in hell, if there's any justice. What about uh... (groaning) - Stay here. - You can't defeat me. I'll see you again in the next life. - I don't think so. - What are you doing? (dramatic music) No, no! No! No! No! No! (tense music) - I'm sorry, but she had to be stopped. - What did you do to her, Doc? - It's a terrible power I have to reach into someone's soul, to create feelings and desires or to take them away. What's left when you take them all away? No emotion, no desire, no hunger, no fear, no love, no hate. Wanting nothing, needing nothing. Feeling nothing. Just an empty soul floating through time and space forever. (somber music) (eerie music)
