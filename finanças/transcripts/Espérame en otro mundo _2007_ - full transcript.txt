Gabriel. Gabriel. Gabriel. Gabi. Wake up. Gloria. Wake up. That's it... Everything is fine. Everything is fine, relax. Breathe, breathe. Gentle... That, that... You left the juice. - Ignacio. - No, I'm late. I already brushed my teeth. Wait, please. What's the matter? Thanks. Five, six, seven, eight. Open. Great movement, happy. Well. Good, Fernando. You are doing very well. Now we are going to do it with couples. Fernando will help me. Make four rows. Ready! That's good Marta and Paco. When do I know if they give me the job? Let's see. You didn't complete your age, please and the last tax return is missing. The declaration has not been delivered to me yet. I need the completed papers, please. Come back later, fill out another form. The following. - Good morning. - Good morning. Do you bring your complete documents? Yes. - Do you have your certificate? - Yes. - Three copies? - Yes. Ignacio, the table. That's what I'm doing, Gloria, that's what I'm doing. I'm coming. - Hello, girl. - Hello. Get in, my love. How nice to see you. Dad, look. Pure fucking debts. - Hi. - Hi Mom. You should be tired after so much salsa and cha cha cha. - A little. - Are you hungry? - Almost everything is ready. - How can I help you? No, everything is fine. Nacho, please give your daughter a drink. Here, daughter. A snack. Thanks Dad. - What is that? - What is it? We are cleaning the room of the stuff. We already threw away a lot of things. Let's see... Look, dad, my Julia. I even found the gun your grandfather left me. I don't know why you want to have a gun in the house. A souvenir from Captain Quiroz. Dad. Well, cheers. Put down the plate, Ignacio, please. This is fine, my love, thank you. This is pure salt, Gloria. Did I put more? Well, today I'm without flavor. I hope the chili sauce has chili in it. Right, Ignacio? The sauce is fine. And this ring? It is the only thing of value that we found in the room. I don't know where it came from. I wanted to sell it, but your mom liked it. I think it's an engagement ring. Let's see... Marcela, let's eat because, if not, the soup gets cold. It's okay. I take advantage of both. Thanks daughter. Your father wants us to move to a smaller apartment. That is why he is cleaning, throwing away all the things... And do you want to move? You were born here. I want you to hear this. Working late and night, doctor. All your life. Mom... You used to listen to other types of programs. What would you like to say to your husband? What would you say to him if you had him in front of you? It's Dr. Luengo. She speaks very well, I have even called the program. Don't lie, I'm going to lower a little. Don't put it down, Marcela. We're listening to the program. Better turn it off. - No. - Turn it off, Marcela. Well then I turn it off, no problem. You hardly come to visit us anymore that's why you don't know what your mom likes and what doesn't your mom like. You know what? I go for the things to paint your hair. No, Marcela. Why did I dye my hair? They already dyed it, is it necessary? You told me on the phone that you needed it. We haven't talked on the phone in a long time, Marcela. No, yes. I think maybe it's one of your friends, this girl, Tere the one from the academy. What? It's her, the one with the locks. Why do you think it was me who called you? Because you left me a message on the answering machine, Mom. I didn't leave a message for you, Marcela. Have you asked the one with the ugly locks? Why don't you ask her? Talk to her about here, talk to her. Good morning. - Hello. - Hello Alberta. - What happened, Tere? - Hello. - How are you? - Very well. How are your dads? Well my dad the same as always. The one who is very strange is my mother. We hadn't argued in years. And yesterday we argued. She was fine... And she got really weird. I believe it is menopause. Why the menopause? Because she is in age. Do you believe it? Can I turn on the radio while I clean, ma'am? Yes, Lucha, but keep it low. Tere... My dad doesn't like the idea of ​​us putting up our academy. He doesn't see a future in it. You will see that we are going to do well. It is our chance to be independent. To have something of ours. We are going to do it the day the owner kicks us out of here. Let's see... Also yesterday I put share invoice into the bank. Well now that I remember it was your idea, it is our dream. You're right. Tomorrow I deposit my share in the bank. Hey... And Braulio? And Arturo? Has he already called you? I haven't heard from him for days. Well, I'm going to change my clothes. I'll see you soon. Bye. We started tapping with the right foot. And we are going to put the opposite hand, long arm and shake our heads. Right. Now we are going to do with a jump. And... Head. Let's take two jumps on each side. So... So... Little fish. And hit. Head, hip, head, hip. Let's do it with music. Wait a bit outside for me. Can I have a moment, please? Ignacio, don't you feel something strange in the city? It's pollution. Gabriel... Gabriel... Gabi? I'm sorry. I mistook you for someone else. I think... He has to leave the house doctor. But what are you going to do if he's not willing to go out? So are you advising me to sue him? Marcela, get out of here. Get out of here, please. No... What happened? Marcela... What happened? I'm going to clean you up. Your father... They fired him from work two weeks ago. He hadn't told us anything because, he was going to get a job very fast. When I asked him what we were going to do with the rent, how we were going to pay for the house, he got mad at me, Marcela. He threw me, slapped me. My dad? Yes. And I still remember when... When he told me to stop teaching my classes. He told me why I was working, we were already old. That his salary was enough for everything. And now look. We are left without his salary. Without mine. What I am going to do? Don't worry about the money, I'll give it to you. I don't want you to spend money, Marcela. If you have enough, you buy something nice. It's my birthday present. Do you know what he told me three days ago? Yes, three days. That we go on vacation. When they didn't even pay him the whole month. Do you want me to bring you some tea? What I want is for you to stay with me for a while. Dad. And now? I need to talk with you. I'm coming right now. - What's the matter? - Why did you hit her? Who did I hit? Don't tell lies anymore. They fired you from work, yes or no? Yes and what? Sure, that's why you take your anger out on her, hitting her. Are you crazy? - What do you mean? - Nobody told me. I saw her, she had blood on her face. Well, maybe she fell or was hit by a door in the kitchen. When I left the house she had nothing. I was upset about the job. I came here to see a friend for a job. You came to get drunk. I had two beers, are you going to scold me? Look, we better go. - Well? - Do you know Gabriel? No. Why? - How is my mom? - She left, she left me. What? - Now what did you do to him? - She left me, do you hear me? I don't know what the hell I'm telling you for. Your mother told the concierge she was going with that Gabriel. Dad... You wouldn't achieve anything by getting drunk. I want you to go up to the house and go to bed. I'm going to go find her. Look it up. It is clear that no one has ever left you. You don't know what you say. Do you? As if it were just about going to sleep and that's it. It must be because I have a lot of gray hair, she doesn't like it. The day before yesterday she told me she wanted to go to the beach. I gave him money from my clearance to find a package. Bitter, ungrateful. But she didn't even have to pay the rent. Well, of course. How was I going to have? If she kept saving to run away. The rent was paid by me. Yes, but she earned her own money. And you preferred that I stop working. And all for what? To assist you? Did she tell you that? Do you know how many times she missed school last year? You can't imagine. Until they ran her off. I don't believe you at all. Where was she going to go? Well, to be an asshole, where else? Or a bitch. Alberta, didn't my mom speak to me? No. Dehydrates. - Dehydrates. - Alberta... If my mom talks, ask her for her phone number and her address. It is urgent for me to locate her. Don't forget it, please. I'm going to be in class. Thanks. Excuse me Where can I find Dr. Luengo? She is gone, she is there until three. But if you want I can give you his phone number. Sebastián Serrano. You aren't Sebastián Serrano. No? So who am I? Why do you say that? Because of your voice. Also, Sebastián Serrano is like... More handsome? Run away from love. Run from the vice that creates the most miserable of dependencies. Sebastián Serrano. Yes, it's me. Why are you looking for the doctor? No. Okay, yes. But thank you very much. Wait. Let me call the doctor for an appointment. We get along well. It's turned off. Don't worry, I'll call you back right now. Do you have a car? Do you want to come with me? - No thank you very much. - Why not? Because I can't accept. As you like, we live very close. Do you think so? I live up to Colonia Portales. You see, neighbor. Come on, what's your name? Marcela Quiroz. So you are a teacher. Yes, dancing teacher. Ballroom dancing, not classical dancer. No, I wish. I was studying but I left because I had to work. Right now I teach in an academy and also individuals. I want to start my own business. Well, our doctor doesn't answer, damn it. But don't worry, I'm going to keep marking her. Can you point your phone to me in the meantime? I'll call you. Sorry to put me in, but... Do you think I can help you? I don't know. But she trusts that doctor a lot. All I want is for her to tell my mother on the radio to look for me to tell me where it is, I need to see her. Hello. Yes? I haven't seen you here before. Can you tell Gabriel I'm here, please? No Gabriel lives here. Yesterday I came to dinner with Gabriel and his parents. Hear me, ma'am! Who are you? Gabi? Gabi? Gabriel? Gabriel? Open, please. Gabriel! Does it bother you that I turn on the radio? I have to check it. Dad, do you have any news from my mom? Well, that's why I ask you. Nacho I have to work. I called everywhere, I went to the delegation in the morning. Well? Sebastián? Today we have a very special guest in the studio, it's Marcela Quiroz. She is the daughter of teacher Gloria, one of our most assiduous listeners. The teacher brings some problems and Marcela brings a solution. But, before that, I would like you to talk to us, How has your relationship been lately? Well, we have always gotten along well. She is a very good mother. Maybe a little nervous. - But nothing else. - And your dad? - Nacho is a good person. - Do you love them? Of course. They are my parents. How can I not love my parents? Sometimes... We fight and we even stop talking. But... Them... - They... - They what? They are all I have. The only thing I have. Teacher Gloria Cisneros left her house two days ago she left leaving behind all her belongings, like she will come back soon, but... But she didn't return. So if you know her and you have seen it, please contact us. And you, Gloria, maybe you are listening to us somewhere please communicate with your daughter. I ask you, your friend forever, Dr. Luengo. We all need to know that nothing bad has happened to you. Very good luck, you know. Find me if you need anything else. - Thank you. - No problem. In five minutes I go to work. Do you want to see what I do? - Okey. - What sign are you? Libra. But I don't feel like it. Come. Eric, I'll give you a little bit of it. Come in. Thanks. Libra... Don't resist, today is a good day to start over. Someone you know will make you a mysterious proposal. Don't think twice. Don't ponder. Remember: instinct must always take you to the right place. Do what you want, Libra. That is the maxim that from today will govern your life. And now listen to this, which are the murmurs of life. Well, friends, we are here in your sports space. Everything about football. With the comments of Orlando Bichis and Juanito López. And a your friend, Jacobo Reyes. Good morning, Juanito or good afternoon rather. Good morning, Orlando. How are you, Jacobo? Before listening to the comments about yesterday's game, let me tell you that Atlante is still missing a goal. Even though it dominated throughout the entire match, unfortunately, it couldn't make it. What do you think is due to the lack of annotations, my dear Juanito? Look, Jacobo, how we were talking a moment ago, I think the technical director has made some changes on the more experienced forwards. Do you think that is it, Juanito? Sure, because the changes you've made, they have baffled the whole team. The heartbeat of the valley the rhythms of the mountains, They are in your ears and in your veins. Because this is also for you, Sagittarius. Today is the appointed day. Dare to tell them, what are you waiting for? It's what he or she has been waiting for. Come closer. Let me tell you what I never told you. Let me take your breath away. I want to die in your arms. Listen to me. Listen. This is the corner of lovers. Your concepts are very interesting, my dear Orlando. And sadly this is how it ends one more broadcast from its sports space: "All about football". Orlando Bilchis and Juanito López say goodbye to you. I'm Jacobo Reyes and I invite you to share these announcements from our sponsors. Well, see you tomorrow. - Bye. - Bye. I was supposed to make you the mysterious proposal. I'm not a Libra. No? So what sign are you? I'm not going to tell you. But if you want you can stay for dinner. Do you cook? Well? What happened, Beto? Stay with her, don't leave her alone for a second. I go down. Get dressed and see you another day. - I take you wherever you want. - No, get dressed. Where is she? She was sitting in the doorway. It's great that you arrived! Excellent! Just look at how you are. What happened? I'm going to talk to you. I'm going to talk to you. Come on, let's go. No, you don't. You aren't. I'm hungry. What happened? Who is him? Go, I'll talk to you later. - No, I'll help you. - No. - Marcela... - No, Sebastián. Don't you understand that I want you to go? Don't talk like that to him, daughter. Let's eat. Mom, what did we just do? Look, how curious. Do you want anything else? No, what for? You are tired. Why did you left? Why didn't you come back? I went out to find a person. And suddenly, Marcela, everything began to change in the city. All the streets were gone. And the houses also left. - And all the parks. - What are you saying? The worst are the people. They are no more, they are no longer. The climate is different. The air smells horrible. Since when do you feel that? I would have taken you to the doctor. Do you know Dr. Parra? Who is Dr. Parra? Doctor Parra is the person who helps me. Today I wanted to see him, but where am I going to find him? If this city isn't the real one. The city I am looking for is elsewhere. And you know it, Marcela. I'm going to talk to my dad. Your dad? For what? So that he knows that you are with me. Nacho has been very worried about you. Nacho? Yes, I met a person who was called like that, Nacho. I'm not going anywhere! I don't know you, help. Something is very wrong here! It's wrong, this isn't him. That isn't him, that isn't him. What happened to him? I don't know. But right now the doctor is going to tell us. Everything is going to be fine. Everything will be fine, don't worry. Marcela... Sometimes I don't know who I am. Sometimes I don't know who you are. I want you to forgive me. It's because of the nerves. Because of the nerves, but everything will be fixed. You will be fine. Quiet. Doctor Parra... This isn't your office. Yes, it is his office. - No. - Yes. Come. I want you to be calm. Right now he is going to review you. And he's going to tell us that everything is fine. Good morning, go ahead. Sit down. Doctor Parra? The doctor's name is José Ibarrola. He's a psychiatrist and he's going to help us. Psychiatrist? Why do I need a psychiatrist? Excuse me sir, we were wrong. - Let's go from here. - No, Mom. Let's talk about Doctor Parra. Trust me. So you... Do you know Dr. Parra? May we speak alone? Well, she can stay. Mommy, I can't stay. I'm going to be out there. Don't go far. In a moment I will come to look for you. Always look for me. Now I go out. Well? Dad. I'm with my mom. And? I was looking for you all night, I left you a thousand messages. I need you to come see her, but immediately. Hello beauty. Hello. - I invite you to eat. - I can't. I have to take care of my mom. Marcela... Is there any way I can help you? I don't know. You're having a really bad time, aren't you? Let me help you. No. You can't get in. My mom is upstairs and... I left her locked up. The conclusion I have so far is that the lady has a hard time living in reality. Prefers illusion, fantasy. A very strong feeling is pushing her into the past. What caused it? What altered her behavior? What made her sick with melancholy? I don't know yet. Did my mom go crazy? Did her lose her mind? - I don't know. - When will you find out? When we confirm whether it has an emotional or physical origin. For that I want to rule out the possibility of injury by blow or a cerebrovascular accident, or even a tumor. I need a neurologist to assess her. Dr. Zabala. He is a highly qualified person. I myself am going to ask you to receive it. Excuse me, Dr. Zabala? - There he is. - Thanks. Good afternoon doctor, I'm Marcela Quiroz. Dr. Ibarrola sent me with you to examine my mom. Yes, Miss. Ibarrola informed me, I already have the file. You could leave her mom with me today. Are you going to hospitalize her? No, but I need to do some studies and that takes time. Excuse me. Gloria? Marcela? Fine, daughter, fine. I already had a cake, thank you. Down? And why don't you go up, daughter? Marcela, please, forget about that, okay? Do you forgive me? Well, then come in. Well. Come in, mija. - Do you want a drink? - No. - A coffee? - No. See what a mess. I'm going to clean. They are taking care of Gloria. In a hospital for the mentally ill. Are you telling me she's crazy to justify her? And the bastard she left with? How stubborn! I'm telling you that she is with me! She told the concierge that she was going with Gabriel. I tried to wear this alone so as not to mortify you. But I can't. I really can't anymore. What does it cost you to help her? Help me. I don't know why she said that. I really don't know. That person doesn't exist. Be patient with her, dad. Better leave things as they are. You don't live with her. I do. Did you forget that you left because you couldn't hold it? Because I was very young. And because I couldn't bear living with you. And because I can't bear to see you like this. See how you live. The truth is that I always liked your courage when you left. I couldn't do it. I put up with all her bullshit, and you don't know how many. And what about her? And me both? I've always had to carry you. And what I wanted, what? What it's like to have a person you love in front of you. And at the same time realize that she isn't there. That she's gone. You don't know, Tere. Marcela, you aren't alone. What I am going to do? Do I put her in a mental hospital? Or do I leave work and come to take care of her all day? - What can I do? - And your dad? He has no willness. And it's better in this way. What are the three of us together and screwed up for? No, that he stays safe better. Your dad isn't going to abandon you, I assure you. I'm going to open the door. Hello, daughter. Hello. - Good evening. - Goodnight. And your mom? Gloria. Who is this man? He shouldn't be here, please take him out. Take. It was among her things. That man is Nacho. He's my dad, he's your husband, Gloria. I don't know him and I'm not done yet. I'm not done yet! I don't know what you are saying about me. I don't have a husband, I don't have a daughter. You don't know anything. I'm lost. Where is my mom? Where did my mom go? Where is everyone? What do you all mean, Gloria? My parents... My friends... Manuela. The avocado of the house. Take. It's liquid, mom. Drink it. Careful, careful! What do you gain by saying that I am your mom? I don't even know your name. I don't know what your name is. I should have left here. From this place. I don't know where. Come. Please come. Look at that picture. It's you and me many years ago, do you remember? Do an effort. Do you remember? No. What went wrong, mom? What do you need? Gabriel. What if you found him? Doctor Parra is going to take me with him. Are you no longer interested in my dad? Is life worth living if the person you love isn't with you? I'm with you. Five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four. One kick and... One, two, three, four. One kick and... Two... Three... Four. Turn around and... Two. Three. Four. Figure 8 is right hip forward, left hip back. We are going to do it twice. Are you feeling bad, teacher? I want a glass of water. Can we help you with something? Who is Gabriel? Any friend of the family? My parents love him very much. But there is one thing that I'm not going to tell you. Tell me. I hear you. There is a person who speaks to me and I'm not that person, I'm not her. And then when I fall asleep I dream of that girl who says she is my daughter. And I get sad. Sometimes so sad that I can't breathe. How old are you, Gloria? Next week I'm going to turn 20 years old. Why? Curiosity. Does it have a cure? The studies carried out so far aren't favorable. She lost the ability to acquire new memories and the memory has been erased backwards. Why? Why do she lie so much? Not lying properly. In her brain there is confusion and memory gaps. So, the lost memories, she sees them as fabricated fake content. Because she needs to have an explanation for herself. I've never seen anything like it. Gloria thinks she is in another time. She wants to be in another time. However, the present and especially you for being his daughter are constantly confront her. Okay, be suspicious all you want but... I'm first of all a psychotherapist. Specialized in past life regression, okay? It was the way I found to help my patients, nothing more. Have you known my mom long? A little, yes. Dr. Luengo from the radio gave her my phone number. May I know what I was coming to see you for? It is a professional secret. Your professional secret can no longer protect anyone. My mother is hospitalized and is seriously ill. Wait... Most of my patients come here trying to find in past lives the explanation to a current problem. She didn't. What she was looking for was a rather close moment. The day she met Gabriel. Your mom wanted to go back again and again to that day. She wanted to live it forever. Settle in it forever, if possible. All I did was hypnotize her into taking her there. She never cared about going further back. Towards another life. Does a full regression, nothing. Are you talking about reincarnation? Don't expect me to believe you. Well, I don't think your mother didn't either. I already told you that I was just coming to meet Gabriel. Why under hypnosis? And in what other way? Gabriel is dead. Dead? They were going to get married. He had even given her an engagement ring. But he died earlier. She was going to turn 20 years old. Do you feel okey? For her, like you, she wasn't interested in any experience with another life that wasn't the current one. Because in this she knew happiness. Really? Without a doubt. Your mother had a brief but true with bliss. That's why she wanted to revive it as many times as I could. That's what she came for. So that, by hypnotizing her, she would provoke the regression at that time. She came to be happy again. I'm very happy for her. We don't have all the same luck. I don't know what happiness is. Don't be so sure. Because if it isn't in this life, it could have been in another. In a distant life, perhaps. It's very nice. Whatever you need ring the bell for me. It was my fault. I never gave any importance to what she was telling me. I wasn't listening to her. Don't blame yourself. I thought she was kind of neurotic and nothing more. I was the one who left her alone in the clinic. I should have stayed with her here. How is my mom doing? Still in the operating room, I'll call you. Look, your mom had this. Is she suffering? Brain death is still a mystery. What hope is there that she will recover, doctor? Unfortunately, very few. It can last a lifetime like this. Then... I want her to take away all that she has in his body. No, dad. Let her die in peace. Why so much shit? Don't tell me that, go to the hospital administration. My obligation is to keep her alive as long as possible. And nothing more. Let's go. I'm going to find a taxi so you can rest. And where are you going to go? I don't know, daughter, over there. I haven't been able to sleep for days. Dad... Do you really want to let her die? No, daughter. Come back... I have to go. I'm going back, wait for me always. Here I am, here I am. Marcela, wake up... All right, breathe gently. Just relax. Just relax. Breathe gently. Gentle... Where are you going? To the bathroom to pee. Again? I think I have to have my prostate checked. Better go home, Sebastian. What's wrong? Go away. Go away and don't come back. Thanks for everything. You were very nice with me. Marcela... I love you very much, really. I want to grow old with you and with no one else. No. That isn't going to happen. Why not? In fact, I was going to propose that we move in together. No, we grew up at different times. When I am your age, we won't stand each other. Better breaking up before. Now it turns out that I'm an old man to you. You aren't the person for whom I can lose my mind. You aren't that person, Sebastian. I thought you loved me too. We both felt alone. Now I have to take care of my parents. What's more... For me life forward no longer makes sense. I saw the application you signed, but we can't do what you want. Please come out, then we'll let you... Take the wires off him or I'll kill him. What are you waiting for? Fuck it, take them off. Quick. Please help. Help, someone come. Please, over here. Take him to the street and drop him around. But he did attack you, doctor. Do what I tell you. Just make sure he doesn't go back in. As of today he can't come to the hospital. Unless you want to be locked up. Why do you put those photos there? So you don't forget us. Of all the sad words spoken or written, the saddest are these: "What could have been." And the song that follows is for you, Marcela. In case you are listening to me. In case someone told you. In case you ever remember me. I bring you some things for your dad. Talk to him. Maybe they interest you. They all work. By the way, can you give me a bottle of rum, okay? Hey... I'm talking to you! I take the bottle. What do you bring? What happened? Sorry, I mistook him for someone else. I'm Nacho. Now that you know me... You will not confuse me again. My name is Gloria. Central, central. I have a Z304. Change. Central copy, change. I repeat, repeat, central. These are the belongings. Sign here please. "I've received." Here. Now come with me to recognize the corpse. Listen to my voice... From this moment only my voice will lead you. Marcela... I want you to back off. That you leave the last years of your life behind. And that you move away little by little. Move backwards. Without fear. What do you see? Blackberries. It is my parents' house. Are you okay there? No. Let's go over there. Go back in time again. Until the first days of your life. Keep going... Towards the womb. Are you okay there? Yes. Enjoy that well-being. Recover the security of your first days. And take it with you. It will be very useful to you. Is there what you are looking for? No. That means that the time has come to go even further. Until another time. To other lives. Seek. Now my voice no longer guides you. It just keeps you anchored to this world. Go on by yourself. Don't worry. Explore other sites. Until you find the experience that will serve you. To continue living. It must exist. In one of your previous lives. We are getting closer. To the appointed destination. Are you ready to go in there? Then... I'm going to count to five and when I'm done you're going to move at that time. To that place... To that life... There. Where happiness awaits you. One. Two. Three. Four. Five.
