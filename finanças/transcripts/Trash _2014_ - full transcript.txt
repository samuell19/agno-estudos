The three boys are missing, and campaigners fear for their lives. The scandal created by the video has reignited the protest movement that saw millions of people take to the streets of Rio last year. Particular anger is focused on evidence of bribes paid to Congressman Santos, as well as endemic corruption across the state of Rio. And protestors are now calling for wholesale political and social change. (LAUGHING) (SPEAKING PORTUGUESE) (BOTH LAUGHING) (SPEAKING PORTUGUESE) (CHEERING) (LAUGHING) (ALL EXCLAIMING)
