Hsiu-yu! Hsiu-yu! Hsiu-yu! Chiang Hsiu-yu! Chiang Hsiu-yu! Chiang Hsiu-yu! Chiang Hsiu-yu, control the pace. Set up our offense after crossing half-court. Remember, move the ball. Space the floor. Create a strong and weak side. YUYING HIGH SCHOOL Enjoy the game! - Let's go. - Let's go. - One, two, three. - Team! CHIANG HSIU-YU, CHIANG TUNG-HAO Kuangcheng's PG Chiang Hsiu-yu takes the ball across half-court. Guarding him is Yuying's Chiang Tung-hao. Tung-hao is actually Hsiu-yu's younger brother. It's going to be a dramatic sibling showdown. Yuying High School misses, Kuangcheng High School gets the rebound. Chiang Hsiu-yu spearheads the attack. This is their final chance to score in the first half. Chiang Tung-hao charges back on defense... Hand back the money! You guys call the shots. What's the point of playing? - Grab him! - Shut up! Get the money! Get it! Go away! That's our money! What are you guys doing? Who the heck are you? What are you looking at? It's just that your cheating is too obvious. Mind your own business! Two front court players taking on two guards. If you didn't play so dirty, it could have been quite entertaining. He just slashed in and drove right by you. How was that traveling? It's a new rule. - Who are you to judge? - Can't hack it? Let's go again. Let him shoot. Don't worry if he tries to drive. I bet he won't drive or shoot. What's that hand signal? Hsiu-yu! Come, I'll give you this side. I got him. I'll help! Why did you help? I got him! You got beat! No foul? Defense. Defense. Hsiu-yu. Are you okay? You're a great passer. Look for more openings. You guys play too dirty. Are you okay? Enough! Tung-hao! I told you he was cutting! I don't have a hearing aid. I couldn't hear you. Let's hear some applause! Good! Are you selling tofu? So easy to carve up. Tung-hao! Can you see that? Thank you. See you next time. Listen up. I was watching you guys very carefully. You have amazing chemistry. Come join my team. I coach Kuangcheng High School. Hsiu-yu, he's a basketball coach. Thank you. Thank you, Coach. Hsiu-yu. What was that? Was the bullying on our junior high team not enough for you? I have a sick team! Won't you even consider it? Cover me. Keep your head down. Four boxes of jackets. - Uncle. - You're back. Tung-hao. Don't go out these next few days. Stay home to help out. What are you staring at? Aunt. Playing basketball until so late. There's food in the refrigerator if you're hungry. Is all this stuff ready? Take it to Mei-ling. If my brother doesn't return soon, these two are going to end up as hooligans. Dumping his kids off just like that. Doesn't he even worry? I'll try again later. Where's the money? "Doesn't he even worry?" "Doesn't he even worry?" "Doesn't he even worry?" Three-pointer. Again. Pass. Behind the back. Your feet stink! I wonder what's going on with Dad. He hasn't called lately. Whatever. We'll just rely on ourselves. Hsiu-yu. How much have we saved? Making money is hard. Besides, you're not working. Hey, I do all the heavy lifting in basketball. You better. Hsiu-yu. Is moving out really that hard? Actually, that coach from before seemed pretty nice. We promised each other we would play in the HBL together. Smoking our opponents like we did today would be so awesome. Fine. If we play, we might as well play for the best. Does your hearing aid still have power? I need to charge it. Hurry, we're running behind. Please wait. Medium sirloin. Medium-well rib eye. I want my fillet medium-cooked. - Medium fillet steak. - Sorry. I want the lobster and fillet combo. Hey, Chubs. Is the fillet ready yet? The customer has already asked twice. - Fillet coming up. - Hurry. The boat has left the port. The fish is coming soon. Server. What are you doing? Customers are complaining. Get a move on, will you? Server. Please wait a minute. Look at what you've done! I'm going to post this online. I'm going to destroy your business. - Please give us another chance. - Look at his stupid face! Look at his stupid face! Let's go to the hospital first. No need... Hello? That's me. Yuying High School? HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL LEAGUE CHAMPION You must be Chiang Tung-hao. Yes. Can you show us moves like this again? - Okay. - Li Yan-tai, come over here. You two play one-on-one. Okay? What are you looking at? Waiting for dinner? Keep going! You need to work on your fundamentals. But you have good coordination. Will you join our team? What about my brother? The thing is, our team won't accept a player with a hearing disability. Think of yourself first. Okay. What's wrong, kid? What are you doing, hiding over there? Filming a music video? Hey, why are you removing it? Hey, kid. Brats on their phones these days never watch where they're... The manager is a jerk too. You accidentally bump into someone and he fires you. The factory's been crazy busy lately. We agreed you would help out this afternoon, but you disappeared without a word. Where did you go? I have finished all the work. So why do you care? You're not my dad. Where did you go? Do you think we want this? We're not like your dad. What does that mean? Just say it. Enough! Your dad hasn't wired us any money for months. Get things straight. We're the ones feeding you right now. Show some respect! Stop! Stop right there! Show some respect! One more game. What's wrong? Where are you going? I don't know. Do you still have power? Yes. We can go to an Internet caf√©. Haven't we saved a lot of money? Let's watch our spending for now. I got fired. Why didn't you tell me earlier? Hurry up. Get in here. Remember to scram early tomorrow morning. Otherwise, the manager's going to be mad at me. The alarm is in the dining area. Don't come out. - Don't get me in trouble. - Got it. Kid. I'm going. - Goodbye. - Cheer up. Here are the keys. - Later. - Take care. Hey. Hurry up. Take a shot. My ball! Check. Lower your stance. Slam dunk! Dunk it home! My turn. Can't you dribble? Put on your cap! Dunk! Where's the ball? Chiang Tung-hao, where's the ball? Get up. I've had enough. No more. What is it? - How did that happen? - It's stuck. Where are you going? Finding a way in. Why didn't you take the key? Who knows? Not so hard. Hsiu-yu. What do we do? Smashing a window is property damage. Plus you're suspected of trying to break in. How could you give him the keys? We'll wait for your parents to get here before we take your statements. If anything is found to be missing later, I'm holding you responsible! Hsiu-yu isn't that type of person. Manager, there's no need for cops. - It's not a big deal. - We're not thieves. Do you want to hit me? Why didn't you call me first? We freaked out when they called us. You're lucky they're willing to resolve things privately. What if they weren't? Don't make your dad worry. Use your brains. I'll get the car. Talk when we get home. Wait for me here. I'll find another way, okay? Hsiu-yu. The coach of Yuying High is recruiting me. I want to go. I just want to play basketball. I don't want to keep living like this. Go for it. Dad You have one new message. Hsiu-yu. Your uncle has already told me everything. But the construction keeps getting delayed. There's nothing I can do. It's good your brother has a team to look after him. But with your hearing problem... I'll ask the foreman again to get you a job here. Chiang Hsiu-yu! Chiang Hsiu-yu! Why didn't I see you here last week? Kuangcheng Gymnasium The one in the middle. Defense. The HBL qualifiers are starting soon. We have to train hard. Thank you, Coach. After I met you last time, I did some research. You played really well in junior high. Why did you stop playing? Your brother's a smart cookie. He chose the championship's favorite. Don't worry. Let me tell you. You're right to choose Kuangcheng. I have faith in you. Kuangcheng is awesome. I also need to remind you. We have three team rules you must remember. One. Tell me everything. Two. No dating. Three. Take Senior for a walk every morning. Senior is... By the way, this is a small school, so sometimes we'll have to share the court. No big deal. Look at how well this gym has been designed. It makes use of natural sunlight, so there's no need to turn on the lights. It does get a little hot though. But that's okay too. Sweating is good for you. Hey, Meng-hsun. - The short-haired girl is cute. - I know. Stop looking. Focus. We have a new teammate today, so allow me to first introduce myself. 12th grade, team captain. Kao Shih-cheng. So buff! Nice block! My goodness. Captain, you don't practice with underwear? Who practices with underwear? Is that possible? Of course, it is. 11th grade, Chiu Wen-shan. Call me Three-P. Nice shot! Guards, all of you have to shoot three-pointers like me. You're so proud. 11th grade, Teng Chih-hao. Call me Teng-tzu. I mainly play small forward. I'm the best player on the team. Just give me the ball. 10th grade, Cheng Fu-sheng. I'm not very good. Last two laps. Fu-sheng, are you okay? Fu-sheng. And you. Don't be nervous. 10th grade, Chiang Hsiu-yu. I'm a guard. - Which guard? - Which guard? Mouthguard. Point guard. What's wrong with your ear? Shut up. Idiot. Are you retarded? Captain, don't new teammates have to treat us to a meal? Free meal! Low! I said low! Look forward! High! Lower! Forward. Look straight. Swing! Keep going! Swing! Firm steps. Lower! Steady! More power! Good! Allow me. Focus. Give him the ball. Come on. Again! Yes, not bad. That's the way to play. No matter who's in front of you, give it all you've got. Understand? - Thank you, Coach. - Go, next! This is the third time you're late. Why are you still here? Get out of here. Go. Go! Listen to me very carefully. We're going for a three-peat this year. I don't have any time for people like him who can't keep up. Do you understand? - Understand? - Yes! So that senior player today left just like that? Yes, he got kicked off the team. That's what the coach said. - All right. - Goodbye. It's okay, it's not like he would make a difference anyway. He wouldn't even touch the ball. Chih-chieh, all we need is you, right? Wait up! Hey, Tung-hao. Remember to tidy all this up. Thank you. Tung-hao, do you want to practice shooting together? Sure. Senior! Senior! Not here! Senior! Senior, wait. That is a teacher's car. Senior, get over here. You sure pick the worst places. Who ordered a large black tea? Are your legs sore? - Not really. - Not really? Those frog jumps yesterday were brutal. We then had to dash 17 times today. I'm dying. Hey, pig. You can't eat before you pay. Can't I? I didn't... Two more strawberry jam sandwiches. Okay, get them yourself. Let's go. She's pretty hot! Cute! Hsiu-yu, are your feelings hurt? Not bad. Stay composed! Go. Kuan-hung. Stay in position! Don't rush it! Don't rush! Ball! What are you senior players doing? Getting dominated by the new kid! I haven't finalized the HBL roster yet. Chih-chieh, don't think your starting position is safe. Understand? Okay, keep going. Coach wouldn't really replace you. The rookie just got lucky. You played poorly. Stop looking for excuses. Says the guy who won't get any playing time. - Can we go now? - Let's go. Chih-chieh, let's go. Remember to tidy up. Shu-jen. Do you want to practice together? What's wrong? Nothing. Chiang Hsiu-yu! You can't hear the whistle. You can't catch the ball. Everybody to the baseline! - I'm sorry. - What's wrong? Keep up! Four-spot suicide drill. Complete it in 28 seconds. Hsiu-yu. What's the point of this if you can't hear anyway? It's all your fault we got punished. Give it back. Give my hearing aid back! What? Why did you break it? Get lost. Stuck-up rookie! Don't think just because the qualifiers are starting, I won't kick you off the team. Captain. What happened today is to be handled in accordance with team rules. Yes, Coach. Hsiu-yu, come here. You have to remember our agreement. You must tell me everything immediately. I'm sorry, Coach. When I was in junior high, I hurt my ear while playing. I couldn't play well and often fought with my teammates. So the coach forced me and my brother off the team. My confidence got worse and worse. I had long given up on playing in the HBL. Thank you for giving me this opportunity. As long as you don't give up, you will always have a chance. Understand? I'll get your hearing aid fixed. Teng Chih-hao. Don't assume you're off the hook. What's up? Team rules say people who fight must hold hands for a day. If you let go, add one extra hour. Foam is dripping from your mouth. It won't drip on you. Stop laughing. Take it seriously back there. Do you want to be punished too? - Wait... - What? Stomach ache. - Don't yank my arm! - Where are they going? I'll go see if they've let go of their hands. I'm going too. - I'm going too. - I'll clear the way for them. Excuse me. Excuse me, let us go through. Don't come in, stay outside. Shut the door. Hurry. Coach says to add an extra hour if you let go. - It stinks! - It stinks! - It stinks so bad! - It stinks so bad! Come out a bit. Come in a bit. - Hsiu-yu. - What? There's no toilet paper. Fu-sheng! Get some toilet paper! - Come out a bit. - Hurry up. Don't yank my arm. - Keep those hands held... - Don't let go! Go and shower. Fight back! You two! Time's already up. Why are you still holding hands? So cute! - So cute! - So cute! Senior. Senior! It's you. You're the one from the breakfast store. I have a name, okay? Is this your dog? It is Coach's dog. - So you're on the basketball team? - Yes. - Poop! - Poop! It should be clean now. I saw you holding hands with a teammate last time. You saw it? It was a punishment. Punishment? For what? For... fighting. You don't get along? No. Senior. Let's go. Let's go. He doesn't want to leave. Thank you for opening the gate for me. I'll treat you to a strawberry jam sandwich next time. Let's go, Senior. Sure. Principal. Coach Chen, come help me. You'll definitely be more accurate than me. Catching Pokemon? Once more. - Got it. - I told you. Let's look ahead. Did you know there's a Bulbasaur at our school? Really? They say this place is a nest. In the last few years since you took over, the basketball team has performed really well. Thank you, ma'am. Ma'am, I put the Pokemon we just caught in your favorites. Great. PRINCIPAL CHEN HSIU-MEI But... What I talked to you about last time has recently been confirmed. I don't know how to tell you this. The board still decided to disband the team next year. I'll promote you to section chief then. It comes with a pay raise. - You can start winding down - No, ma'am... team activities this year. What about the first-year students? You're struggling yourself too. I know you've put a lot of your own money into the team. But we're a small school. We don't have the money that others have. No, I don't mind putting in my own money. Even they haven't given up, so how can you give up on them first? - Go! - Go! Go! Keep running! Big strides! - Keep going! - Keep going! Go. Next group, get ready. Ready, go. - Go. - You can do it. - You can do it. - You can do it. Okay. Hurry. You can do it. Come on, hurry. Coach. Go. Go. Come. Assemble over here. - Assemble. - Assemble. Come closer. Being able to train with all of you makes me very happy. I hope everyone can remember this feeling even when you've gone to a different school. Thank you for believing in me and choosing this school. The principal informed me today that the school is disbanding the team next year. So this will be our last year. Why is this happening? I'll help the 10th and 11th graders transfer. Because if you stay, you won't be able to play next year. That's all for today. Captain. Wrap up. Coach. - Captain. - Captain. - Captain. - Captain. Kuangcheng Gymnasium - Let's go! - Let's go! - Let's go! - Let's go! - Keep it up. - Keep it up. Keep it up! Everyone. We only have the 12 of you left. There's no turning back. All we can do is keep moving forward. It's only going to get harder from here. It can't possibly get any easier. The HBL Division 1 Championship kicks off with qualifying matches at the end of this month. A total of 35 teams will be participating. The top eight qualifiers will advance to the next round, where they will vie for the title with last year's top eight. After No. 1 takes the ball across half-court, he will use No. 4's pick to dribble around to the 45-degree angle. At this time, No. 4 will roll in. Hi, Senior. Our team is playing in the qualifiers. I wanted to ask if your school has any empty dorms. - Go! - Go! You're one second off-target. Come up for air less in the last 10m. - Understand? - Yes. I'm getting an extra strawberry jam sandwich. Ko Yi-an! - This is for you. - What? Do you know how to throw? Okay. Tell me why you stayed. - I don't want to give up halfway. - I want to keep playing with the team. - I want to prove myself to my grandma. - I don't want to lose anybody. I want to win the championship. I want to lose weight! - Impossible! - Impossible! - One, two, three. Team! - Senior! This is Shu-wen. I'm coaching high school basketball at the moment. We're going to play in the qualifiers in a few days. I remember your cousin's dorm was nearby. Are there any rooms you could lend us? No, I don't need a room. I'm happy sleeping in my car. We're used to sleeping in the car. Everyone is focused on us. They all want to beat us, waiting for us to make mistakes. The moment we think we're guaranteed to win is when we're most likely to make mistakes. In the final quarter of the game, Yuying's No. 15, Yu Han-ting, throws down a two-handed reverse jam. He finished with 32 points. He was an alumnus. He went to play in the U.S. after graduation. Before he joined our team, his family was in a very bad place. But in the end, at the pivotal moment, he was able to bring home the victory. It changed everything. He did it. Can you do it? Can you do it? Can you? This is high school basketball. Full of drama. Yu Han-ting dominated the court and turned around Yuying's fortunes. His brilliance has also changed his own fate. Welcome to the live broadcast of the HBL qualifying round. We are now bringing you Xingwu High School versus Kuangcheng High School. Kuangcheng High School is currently being led by coach Chen Shu-wen. Before he took over the reins, this school couldn't even get to the second round. But last year, they made it through the qualifiers. Hence, seeing how this school performs in the upcoming season is something we very much look forward to. It's just like what we've done in practice. Don't panic out there. Control the pace. Show me some attitude. - Yes! Go! Go! - Okay, let's focus. - One, two, three. - Team! - Go! - Go! - Go Kuangcheng! - Go Kuangcheng! Go! Go Fu-sheng! Get back on defense! Hurry! Hsiu-yu! Five-one. Five-one. Hsiu-yu, don't worry. Don't get down on yourself. - Set a pick. - Go! Get the rebound. - Pass. - Get back! Hurry, get back! Time-out. Tell me why you are here. It is to win! If you don't want to win, go home! Chiang Hsiu-yu. The point guard needs to be confident. Call out the plays and make yourself clear. Is this all we're capable of? Surely not. Let's go. - Xingwu! - Go! - One, two, three. - Team! - Xingwu! - Go! - Xingwu! - Go! - Xingwu! - Go! Xingwu! - Go! - Go! Go Kuangcheng! - Go Kuangcheng! - Go Kuangcheng! - Go Kuangcheng! - Go Kuangcheng! - Go Kuangcheng! - Go Kuangcheng! Go Hsiu-yu! Go! Fu-sheng. Ball! Go! Double. - Be careful. - Be careful. Be careful. Are you okay? Are you okay? Are you all right? Are you okay? I'm fine. They're playing zone defense. Pay attention to that. I'll help you out in the next possession. They're doubling you, so be careful. Man to man! - Defense. - Defense. Very good! Go Hsiu-yu! - Go! - Good luck! Watch the rebound. Get it! - Here! - Here! This way! Nice! Hsiu-yu, you take the ball. Captain, you set a screen for him. - Kuangcheng! - Kuangcheng! This game has been unexpectedly exciting. In particular, Kuangcheng's PG, Chiang Hsiu-yu, has played like two different people in the two halves. His play was quite rocky in the first half, but in the second half, he controlled the entire court. - Ten, nine, - Ten, nine, - eight, seven, six, - eight, seven, six, - five, four, three, two. - Five, four, three, two. They won. Really? That's fantastic. - Kuangcheng! - Kuangcheng! - Kuangcheng! - Kuangcheng! Grandma, we won. Did you see it? Yes, I'm very happy you won. My hands are sore from clapping. I've lost my voice from cheering so much. How did you get so good? Coach, I'm sorry. I don't have anything I can give you. - Except this. A lucky charm. - This is great. - Please look after Fu-sheng for us. - I will. He's a hard worker. - I'm counting on you. - Okay. Make him better. - You work hard. - Thank you, Coach. Are you Hsiu-yu's dad? - Coach - Hi. This year's Kuangcheng High School indeed appears to be full of potential. Unfortunately, it has been reported that this team might be disbanded next year. If this team is really being disbanded and the students want to keep playing, they only have two options. One, transfer to another school. Two, remain at the school and give it their all in this final year. Wen-hsiung. I know your wife passed on too early and it hasn't been easy chasing work these last few years. But your two boys still need their family. They might not say it, but children still want their parents by their side. I know. I'll leave you in peace. You nearly caught me. I let you win. Senior, hush. I didn't expect you guys to play so well. I thought with the team disbanding, you would just mess around. But now, you've made it to the next round. How could we just mess around? We're fighting very hard. What about your own tournament? The coach says I need to improve by another second. A second? Swimming is so hard to understand. In basketball, don't you need to win by just one point? Yes. Can you swim with me a little longer? Kao Shih-cheng! Slam dunk! - Five, four, three... - Five, four, three... The game has ended. Kuangcheng wins 87 to 65. You're getting better and better. The next game is between Yuying High and Kaoyuan Vocational High. Isn't that your little brother? - What? - Your brother. Chiang Tung-hao! Chiang Tung-hao! Chiang Tung-hao! Chiang Tung-hao! Sorry, we're warming up. Dad is hurt. He's in the hospital. Let's go now. I have a game. I'll head over afterward. Let's go! Let's go! What are you doing? Chiang Tung-hao! Chiang Tung-hao! Come on! - Let's go! - I have a game. Chiang Tung-hao, with the layup to give Yuying the first points of the game. Your dad fell at the construction site and hurt his chest. He's in surgery right now. I told him to rest but he wouldn't. He just wants to keep making money so he can bring you boys home sooner. Hsiu-yu. Hsiu-yu. Hsiu-yu. Hsiu-yu. Hsiu-yu. Sorry. I didn't know it was so serious. All that matters is your game, right? - I'm here, aren't I? - Okay. Then, let's take turns looking after Dad every day. - Don't you know that Dad... - Where was he when we needed him? He always makes us deal with our own problems. Can you stop being so selfish? Or else? My team is very important to me right now. Besides, I still have games to play. So only you have a team? I have games too. It's different. Aren't you guys disbanding? What's different? How is it different? - Say it! - Chiang Hsiu-yu! - Say it! - What? Am I wrong? What did you say? What the heck are you saying? What the heck are you saying? Say it! What the heck are you saying? What the heck are you saying? Hit me! Hit me until I can't play... so you can win. Come back. Squat lower. You're an athlete, yet you get into fights and don't look after your body. Keep going! Tung-hao. Is your leg better? Don't rush things. Rehabilitate properly. Once you recover, Coach will definitely let you play. Shu-jen. I just want to play basketball. Why does it have to be so hard? After a slew of tough battles, - this year's dark horse, Kuangcheng... - Mr. Chiang, let's check your wound. Has finally earned the final spot in this year's top eight. Next up, brothers Chiang Hsiu-yu and Tung-hao go head to head on the court. They were briefly on the same team in junior high, but are now rivals gunning for the same crown. You can't move around like that. The wound might tear. No, you're blocking my view. Little brother Chiang Tung-hao - is Yuying's starting guard, - Dad. But sat out the last couple - of games due to injury. - Hey. What are you watching? - Just channel surfing. - Fish congee. Stop wasting money. They've got everything here. Okay. How's the team going? Not bad. How did you get like that? Come here. I'll give you a massage. - It's nothing. - Come here. Hurry. Not so hard. It only works when it hurts. Dad, stop it. You'll make your wound bleed. It won't. I don't care. When you played basketball in junior high, I always thought you were just messing around. What? I took it very seriously. You just didn't see it. I beg of you. Don't try so hard out there, okay? The most important thing is to not get hurt. Understand? Dad, we've advanced to the next round. Of course, we need to try harder. You've grown up. Compete! Hsiu-yu, keep competing! Don't let him get by you! - Maintain your form. - Fu-sheng. Go! The next group, on standby. Good! - Are you okay? - I'm okay. Nice play. Are you all right? Hsiu-yu. The games are only going to get more physical from here. Have you thought about not relying on it anymore? I believe you can. - Okay? - Thank you, Coach. - Nice play. - Nice play. - Nice. - Nice. That was good. One more time! Let's keep fighting! It's raining. Senior. How have you been? We have to play soon. Our training has been intense. Me too. Is... going up against your brother making you nervous? No. Is he really good? Yes. But on the court, I want to beat him. Our coach says swimming is about competing with yourself. You always have to be faster and better than before. Don't compare yourself with others. Fine. Even though Yuying really is very snobby. Stupid brother! Go for it. What are you kids doing? Aren't you on the basketball team? Will that short-haired girl come to watch the top eight rounds? - She's so pretty. - Yes. Do you have time to look around during the games? Of course. She comes to see me. - Ridiculous. - Yes, right. Chiang Hsiu-yu, you're going too slow. Faster! Captain, what happened? He got caught with his girlfriend. Are you taking a stroll? Faster! Coach, I'll run with him. What are you doing? Coach, we're all responsible! He's the one dating and having fun! How are you responsible? Teng-tzu! All of you want to run, do you? Fine! No stopping until I say so! - Yes, Coach! - Yes, Coach! Chiang Hsiu-yu. Team rules are to be strictly enforced. You're suspended for the next game. The time-out has ended. Yuying leads by 21. Chiang Tung-hao prepares to attack. Catch up quickly! Sharpshooter Wang Tai-hao shoots for three! Don't panic! Ball! Defense! - Fu-sheng! Get him! No. - Slam dunk! Where's the defense? Cheng Fu-sheng Come on! Speak! Cheng Fu-sheng, hurry! Fu-sheng, get up on him! Chiang Tung-hao drives, hangs, and scores! Cheng Fu-sheng can't contain Chiang Tung-hao at the rim. - He jumped way too early, - Time-out. Not taking advantage of his size. Kuangcheng has called for a time-out. Chiang Tung-hao has been unstoppable today. He's scoring with ease from both inside and out. Listen. I don't care how tired you are. Fight to the very end. Fu-sheng. Help carry your captain's burden. Defend the zone. Let's work harder, okay? - Go! - Go! - Kuangcheng! - Go! Kuangcheng! - Go! - Go! Without their point guard, Kuangcheng's execution has really suffered. We had been expecting a sibling showdown. But for some reason, coach Chen Shu-wen has not played Chiang Hsiu-yu at all. Coach. Pay close attention to the game. That's your job today. Why aren't you shooting when you're wide open? Why keep forcing things inside? Pass! Fu-sheng. Hey! Medics! Please let me go through. Are you okay? Can you straighten your leg? No? Can you two give him a hand? Don't worry, we'll run some tests later. Come, be careful. Come on. Substitution. Kuangcheng. - Come on! - Come on! Come on! Five-two! Run! Defend! Chiang Tung-hao! After the injury to their captain, Kuangcheng can only rely on rookie Cheng Fu-sheng on the inside, but he can't seem to stop Yuying's interior assault. - Back! - Hurry! Looks like this game has slipped out of Kuangcheng's reach. The game has concluded, 85-51. The winner is Yuying High School. Yuying currently sits atop the leaderboard and is guaranteed to make the semi-finals. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Yuying! - Yuying! - Yuying! - Yuying! - Thank you! - Thank you! Driver, please stop the bus up ahead. We lost today. Let's jog back. I'm sorry, everyone. I couldn't help you guys out there. It's not over yet. We won't know if we've been eliminated until the final results come out tomorrow. All we can do now is keep working. Come on! Keep up! Let's go! - Let's go! - Let's go! Why didn't you take a few more days off? No need to come back so soon. I can't. Less work means less pay. Next month's project at the East will still need your services. Sure. Foreman. I wanted to ask if... there are any job vacancies up north. North? I need to check with the headquarters. Okay. - I'll ask them for you. - Thank you. - No problem. - All right. What an exciting finish. In the end, Dongshan High School wins eighty-eight to eighty-seven over Gaofan High School of Industry and Commerce. Kuangcheng High School will also be happy about this result because it means they have qualified for the Final Four. - Yuying High School! - Yuying High School! Chiang Tung-hao stands at the free throw line. He shoots and makes the free throw. The first team in the championship game is Yuying. The teacher's gone. Five minutes remaining in the fourth quarter. Chiang Hsiu-yu for three. From way downtown! It's good! The final possession of this semi-final game. Chiang Hsiu-yu makes a bounce pass. His teammate catches the ball and finishes under the rim! What a buzzer-beater! Kuangcheng completes their comeback victory. The final ticket to the championship has been taken by this year's dark horse, Kuangcheng. I think Chiang Hsiu-yu is this year's best PG. I can't wait to see the rookie sensation Chiang Tung-hao. The HBL title is the holy grail of high school basketball. Following a six-month-long season of more than 140 intense games, we are now heading into the climax. This year's Yuying team seems even stronger than last year's. Captain Wang Tai-hao, point guard Tang Chih-chieh, and power forward Luo Jen-chih. The super trio that helped capture last year's crown is still on this year's team. But the standout is still, of course, the rookie sensation Chiang Tung-hao. During the quarterfinals, he set this season's single-game record with 35 points. Kuangcheng is a team that had never been in the top eight before. But in their final season, they have survived test after test to become a worthy threat to Yuying's three-peat aspirations. Can Kuangcheng bounce back from their previous encounter to miraculously slay the Goliath this time around? In the backcourt, Kuangcheng's Chiang Hsiu-yu and Yuying's Chiang Tung-hao are definitely the keys to this final. Discovered on a streetball court, they have come all the way to the HBL championship game. Who will emerge as the ultimate winner of this sibling showdown? CHIANG HSIU-YU, CHIANG TUNG-HAO First, set your goal, then challenge yourself to achieve it. Turn the impossible into the possible. Look, everybody. The basketball team is here. Our basketball team really is amazing. They've gone further than our school has ever gone before. I've gone to watch them every game. I thought I would only have to watch one game. I never expected it would turn into so many. Let's invite Coach Chen to the stage for a few words. How about this? Yes! Coach Chen, come up. Coach, don't be shy. Come on! Ma'am. Testing. We are a team that's about to be disbanded. Throughout all these years, Kuangcheng had never made the final. I should say, not even the semi-finals. People thought we had no chance. They even wanted us to give up. But there's a group of people who didn't give up. They are the 12th graders, Kao Shih-cheng, Lin Wei-li, Chou Meng-hsun, and Liu Chia-kang. The 11th graders, Teng Chih-hao, Chiu Wen-shan, Yuan Hung-ta, and the 10th graders, Chiang Hsiu-yu, Cheng Fu-sheng, Peng Ta-lun, Wei Po-chun, and Pan Chien-ming. I'm just a coach. They're the ones out on the floor, not me. You have no idea how much sweat they shed every day. How much pain they must endure. All the setbacks and naysayers. But I've discovered that they are also... Getting stronger every day. Arms up! Again! Come on! You did it. I'm proud of all of you. I really do. We may only have 12 people, banged up and all, but we still give everything we've got. Your grandma will be watching you from above. You can do it. Again! Compete! - Open your arms! - Go for it! Good! Students. You will all have battles to face in the future. When you face setbacks, I hope you can remember. There's a group of people here who don't know how to give up. They can do it, so can you. My players. When you're battling on the court, I hope you'll also remember. Behind you, there's a group of people watching you. Because of you, they have the courage to keep moving forward. Come on! Keep it up! How do I get out of this? Turn right at the next intersection. Do your best. Go! - Go! - Go! - Go Kuangcheng! - Go Kuangcheng! - Kuangcheng! - Go! - Kuangcheng! - Go! - Kuangcheng! - Go! - Kuangcheng! - Go! Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to this year's live broadcast of the HBL Division 1 Championship. The two teams battling it out are Yuying High School and Kuangcheng High School. Countless high school students play basketball, but only a few can truly step onto this court. This is Kuangcheng High School's last game. Give it your all. Don't give up easily. - One, two, three! - Team! Five months of competition. Thirty teams. One hundred and forty-plus games. This long journey ends with the final game. Everyone, please shout out the name of your championship team! Our team is entering. Start cheering! - Kuangcheng! - Go! - Kuangcheng! - Go! Go! Chiang Hsiu-yu! Good luck. Over there. See him? Hsiu-yu! Go Hsiu-yu! He's my friend. Yuying High won the title last year. They're the defending champions, so there must be a lot of pressure on Kuangcheng. A rookie sensation has emerged from Kuangcheng this year and that's their point guard, Chiang Hsiu-yu. He's a very special player. He has averaged over 10 assists per game this tournament. Kuangcheng's backcourt is very reliable when he's on the floor. I'll remind you one last time. We must go on the offense. Go, go and go! When you grab the rebound, turn around immediately and find an open man. As soon as you're open, don't hesitate. Let's play like how we practiced. Chiang Hsiu-yu, remember. Control the pace. Be patient. One possession at a time. Show me why we are the championship's favorites. - Let's go. - Let's go. - One, two, three. - Champions! Space the floor. Create a strong and weak side. Okay! Enjoy the game! - One, two, three. - Team! Remember. Your main mission today is to shut down No. 4. Okay? Deny him. Don't let him breathe or get the ball. Understand? - Go! - Okay. Screen. This year's HBL Division 1 Championship officially begins! - Get back! - Horns. Help. KUANGCHENG VERSUS YUYING Double-team. Go up, Fu-sheng! Fu-sheng! Up to this point, Yuying has given off a very different vibe. Indeed. Yuying has applied a lot of pressure on Kuangcheng from the tip-off, causing multiple turnovers. We can see right now that, in terms of aggression and pressure resistance, Kuangcheng is clearly not matching up to Yuying. That's why I think this game will be a huge test of Kuangcheng's bench depth. KUANGCHENG VERSUS YUYING Close in! - Backcourt! - Backcourt! Tighter! Coach Hsu Wei-hung is indeed an experienced strategist. It's the first quarter and he's applying a 2-2-1 full-court press they haven't used all tournament. It has cut off all of Kuangcheng's passing lanes, causing Chuang Hsiu-yu to make a lot of errors. - Eight, seven, six, - Pass! - Five, four, three, - five, four, three, - two, one. - Two, one. The first quarter has ended. Yuying has a 12-point lead. For Kuangcheng coach Chen Shu-wen, this will of course be very concerning. For all 10 minutes of the first quarter, their field goal percentage was abysmal. Plus, their bench has always been very thin. It's possible the gap will only grow wider in the second quarter. What's wrong with all of you? Have we lost? Have we already lost? Why are all of you so dejected? Fu-sheng. Your grandma entrusted me with this responsibility. Don't forget that. Be confident. I'll leave it to you. Come on, let's go! - Let's go! - Let's go! - One, two, three. - Team! The second quarter has commenced. The score is 23 to 12 in favor of Yuying. Fu-sheng, keep jumping! No. 15, Cheng Fu-sheng, grabs the rebound. Pass to Teng-tzu! No. 7 Teng Chih-hao scores on the fast break. Nice! Come on! Come on! Keep pressuring! How is that not a foul? Offensive foul! - Offensive foul on Kuangcheng. - Good call. That's a bad call! You guys fouled first. Technical foul. Technical foul on Kuangcheng. Yuying to the free throw line. KUANGCHENG VERSUS YUYING - Eight, seven, - Eight, seven, - six, five, - six, five, - four, three, two, one. - Four, three, two, one. What a block! At the end of the first half, Chiang Tung-hao delivers a massive chase-down block on his brother. Yuying now leads by 18. That block must have sent Chiang Hsiu-yu's confidence down the pits. Indeed, we predicted before the game that Chiang Tung-hao might be Kuangcheng's biggest obstacle to the championship. However, an 18-point deficit in today's game is definitely not insurmountable. Coach. Let me play. I can't watch them get bullied anymore. Kao Shih-cheng. What if your injury gets worse? Don't you want to keep playing in college? You said it yourself. We must carry the burden together. I want to fight alongside them. Yes, I did say that. But you're too injured to carry anything. Even if I can't help on offense, I can still do everything I can on defense. Coach. Let me play. - One, two, three. - Champions! A-Tai. Didn't No. 14 injure his knee? Viewers, your eyes are not mistaken. Kuangcheng's captain, Kao Shih-cheng, is about to take the floor. - Get ready! - He was injured during the quarterfinals. It is unlikely he has fully recovered. Is coach Chen Shu-wen's decision to play him at this time pushing things a little too far? Defense! Hey! Help him! Nice play! Quick! - Quick! - Beware of the attack from below! Stay in control! Go! Time-out. Don't let No. 14 play low post. If he gets the ball, double-team. Force him to pass it back out. Understand? In the time he has been out there, Kao Shih-cheng has played extremely well. Indeed. Despite playing with an injury, captain Kao Shih-cheng has dominated the boards at both ends and spearheaded the team's spirited comeback. A breakaway pass down to the other end... The basket counts. And one! Defensive foul on Yuying. Kuangcheng will get an additional free throw. Can you continue? Help him up. - Captain! - Go! - Go, captain! - Captain! Go! - Go! - Go! He sinks the bonus free throw. Now is indeed a good time to give Kao Shih-cheng a round of applause. Despite playing with an injury, he went hard in the paint during the third quarter, helping his team narrow the deficit to just eight points. Don't waste Captain's efforts. Carry the burden of victory! - One, two, three. - Team! Hold on to it for me. Are you sure? - I'll give it a try. - Come on! - Come on! - Come on! Captain! Beware of attacks from below! The games are only going to get more physical from here. Have you thought about not relying on it anymore? When I was in junior high, I hurt my ear while playing. I thought I would never have the chance to play for another team. Go Teng-tzu! - Hey! - Hey! Go. Okay. Why didn't you call fouls? - Technical foul. - That was blatant! Technical foul on Kuangcheng's head coach. Yuying to the free throw line. We've hit the end of the third quarter. Kuangcheng's play this quarter was remarkable. They've managed to cut the deficit from 18 points all the way down to just six. What kind of defense is this? Look at me! What kind of defense is this? Look at me! Chiang Tung-hao! Who are you defending? Who are you defending? My brother. Good. Chih-chieh. You're up. Defend better. Get off. Get off. - Tighter defense! Use your feet! - Better defense! Come on. Let's go! - One. - Champions! We have to secure this quarter. Tighter! Tighter defense! Steady! Tighter defense! - Kuangcheng! - Kuangcheng! I'm giving you one last chance. If you still treat him like your older brother, you will lose this game. Go. Hey. Go. Chiang Hsiu-yu has helped reduce the deficit to three points. Yuying is now making a substitution to bring back No. 5 Chiang Tung-hao. Get back on defense! Give it! Medics! Go Hsiu-yu! Chiang Tung-hao Chiang Tung-hao is still standing in the same spot. Come here. Listen up. We're still in the lead, so you have to remember to make them play at our pace. We must secure the defensive boards. Remember. Control the pace. No silly fouls. Understand? Are you okay? You're still the focal point of our offense. Remember. Pass if you see an open man. Don't force things. - Okay. - Good. Come, Tai-hao. - Come on! - Come on! Hsiu-yu, you see the floor better than anyone else. Utilize your court vision and team chemistry. It's just like when you play with your brother. Each person on this team is your brother. Everybody, look to set picks for Hsiu-yu. Okay, let's go! - Team! - Team! Thank you, Coach. Believe in yourself. Go. Let's go. Now, both Kuangcheng and Yuying's guards have stopped moving. Go Hsiu-yu, Tung-hao! - Go! - Go! - Go! - Chih-chieh! Good shot! Teng-tzu, get in there! Are you okay? KUANGCHENG VERSUS YUYING - Get back! - Time-out. - Focus - Listen up. - Later, we attack fast... - Listen! This possession is very important. Okay? Execute horns again for Tung-hao. If we miss, get back immediately. The worst outcome is them hitting a three-pointer to tie. But don't forget, we're out of time-outs. No more time-outs! So we need to be ready to break their full-court press. Remember to watch for my signal. Watch for my signal! They'll definitely get the ball to Chiang Tung-hao, so we need to help aggressively on defense. We don't have much time left. Hsiu-yu, you'll still handle the ball. Go in for a two-man game with Fu-sheng. Don't forget. We're the champions. - Come on. - Let's go! - One, two, three. - Champions! Chase down the lead! Face the pressure! - Let's go! - Let's go! - One, two, three! - Team! Quick! Hsiu-yu, you'll still handle the ball. Go in for a two-man game with Fu-sheng. Peng, come down to set a pick for Three-P. - Three-P, you come up. - Come up. - Use the screen. - Quick! Hsiu-yu, get the ball to Three-P. Three-P, you take the three-pointer. A chance for an outside shot. Three-pointer... Kuangcheng has tied the game! Only 3.3 seconds left on the clock! Hey! One-four. Man to man! Get back! Quick! Check. - I just want to play basketball. - Let's go! - I have a game. - What's different? - Say it! - Chiang Hsiu-yu! How is it different? What the heck are you saying? Hsiu-yu. I'm sorry. We've finally made it. Chiang Tung-hao's buzzer-beating layup has propelled Yuying to become this year's HBL champion! Unbelievable. What a spectacular game. - Yuying! - Yuying! - Yuying! - Yuying! - Good game. - Thank you. I'm not sure how to say this, but I really hope your team won't disband. - Good luck. - Thank you. - Champion. - Champion. - Champion. - Champion. Hsiu-yu. Wen-hsiung. Spectacular game. Congratulations. I won't lose to you next time. Let's go, shoulder to shoulder No matter how hard it gets On the road to growing up No one can avoid setbacks Go Kuangcheng! Even if we fall We'll still see the rainbow, in the end We walk together because we share a dream - Go Kuangcheng! - Go Kuangcheng! - Kuangcheng! - Go! - Kuangcheng! - Go! We must train every day in this gym to be the best. Give 100 percent every time. Each and every one of you guys. - Can we do better? - Yes! - Can we do better? - Yes! Good! - Go! - Defense. Go get him. Quickly. Attaboy. Good job. Lead with this foot. Go! Again! Good job. Good. Hands up! Good shot! How's it going? - Good job! - Go! Okay. Good job! Now, let's go! Go. Nice shot! Even the upper deck is full. So many people. - Big crowd. - Big crowd. So nerve-racking. I've never played in front of so many people. He's pretending. - Pretending? - Yes. I could tell straight away. He's pretending to be serious. He's brooding right now. Why do you say that? He's just... I think he's just acting pretentious. Okay, let's have a break for dinner. - Hold it in. - Calm down. Calm down a little. Calm down. - Okay? - Yes My nose hurts. My arm hurts. My eyes hurt. Champions! They've been sitting for too long. It's starting to affect their rationality. So... I would advise you. One, don't play basketball. Two, don't be an actor. Or three, play basketball and act too. This is the outcome. If we played a real game, - Yuying would have no chance. - We would win for sure. All they can do is use their hair - to intimidate us. - Yes. But they have nothing. Yuying claims they are better-looking than us. - Nonsense! - Nonsense! I can beat all of them by myself! - How do you spit in a stream? - Put more pressure. - That's weak. - That's weak. - Two, one. - Two, one. Even if we fall We'll still see the rainbow, in the end Hanging out at Kuangcheng with all of you. Jogging together. And now we're in the final game. It has been exhausting. But being with you guys every day makes me really happy. Just being on the team with all of you. I really cherish our time together, all the way to mid-September. I will cherish every single day. Continue walking forward... Go Kuangcheng! Hey, champion. Who wears their championship ring every day? I know you want to try it on. Here. I'll lend it to you. Say the magic words. You need to say, "Please, Mr. Champion. - Can I try on your ring?" - Show off. Do you think it looks better on my ring finger or my middle finger? I think you look better without it.
