(dramatic music) - Gentlemen, gentlemen please. You must take your places. Gentlemen. - Ha ha, here's to us before we go and take that village down below. - Enough. Get to your places or we'll never be on our way. This is not a time for drunken celebration. - Your Grace, we always celebrate before a raid and we always drink when we do. - Shut up, you insect. This is no game we play. This painting shall be my legacy, a record of the beginning of my reign of greatness. I think this is my better side. Shh, did you hear it? It's the calm before the storm. We shall reach down into that village of weakness and pull from it that which will make me the most powerful man on the earth The jewel of Polaris. We shall turn that village inside out until we find it. When I have the jewel of Polaris I will be invincible. (laughing) - Your Grace. I have heard Darbin, the great magician... - Okay. - Lives in that village. He's said to be the most powerful wizard in all the land. Are we not to be afraid of him, Master Falco? - You dare speak his name in my presence. For speaking that name and for doubting my power your punishment shall be to never speak again. - No, no. - And for any other doubters now or in the future the punishment shall be even more severe. Artist, a little smaller on the nose I think. How long we gonna be here? - Stillness is a virtue, Your Grace, and patience is its own reward. - You seem different. Yesterday you were much taller and thinner. Guards, seize this man. - It's Darbin. - You are foolish to challenge me old man. - The jewel of Polaris. - You have perpetrated evil far too long Falco. I will now send you where you can do harm to no one. I send you and your shameless cohorts into the prison of this canvas. - No. (thunder and lightning) (coughing) - I will try to protect you and all who reside herein with the jewel of Polaris. (animal noises) (coughing) (dramatic music) For so long the jewel of Polaris has been desired by evil men. Please protect this treasure. Only allow a pure individual, one worthy of its power to ever possess it. - Can't five minutes go by without you annoying me? - What's your problem? - You're my problem you little stain. - Look, I finished. - Sorry, but it's raining outside. - So, go up to your sty. - Can't, carpet's mean on the blade and besides dad's up there. - Of course you never do anything that might annoy him. - Why annoy him when I can irritate you? - You spoiled little brat. - Toro, toro. - Get out of here. - Missed me again. Face it Kim, you throw like a girl. - You got that part right, flat as a pancake brother. Now are you gonna stop annoying me or do I need to get rough? - Rough, rough, rough, rough, rough, rough. - Is there a problem? - No. - Good, let's go then. - You're lucky dad came down when he did. I had you right where I wanted you. - Yeah, you wish. I can't believe I have to babysit you two. - Who you callin' a baby? - I'm not a baby. - I know you're not a baby, Casey, but you weren't egging them on were you? - No, I don't like it when they fight. I just like the loose change they drop on the ground. Cleared 65 cents this time. - Not too bad. (gentle music) Okay, here we are kids. - Bye dad. - Bye hon. - Bye dad. The museum closes at eight, don't be late. - Take care of the kids for me. - Don't worry dad, everything will be fine unless Ben drives me to it. - You don't have your roller blades in there, do you? - No way dad. You know it's against the rules to skate in the Museum. Kim would kill me. Art supplies. - Art supplies. - Later dad. - Okay, here's the deal, freak. I like my job at the museum and I wanna keep it. So, you go do your art report and try not to embarrass me or get me fired. Got it? - Got it. - Hello Kim. - Hi Monty. - Who's your pretty tag along. - My sister, Casey. - Nice to meet you Casey, I'm Monty. - Hi Monty. - You must be Ben. Are you the artist in the family? - The struggling artist. - Keep practicing. One day your pictures might end up on the walls here at the museum. - You think so? - Sure. - Hey, could we order a pizza? - Yeah, pizza, pizza. - We'll see. As long as you two keep out of trouble. - Sure, no problem. - Ben, you need to watch over Casey. She's your responsibility. - No way, I got my own plans. - Ben, I mean it. - I got my own plans too. - Ben, you two stick together. I don't have time to come looking for you. - All right, all right, we'll stay together. Just in case we get separated we have these walkie talkies. - Real handful, huh? Don't worry, I'll check on 'em when I make my rounds. - Thanks, I'm sure everything will be fine. - Bye bye. - Bye. (dramatic music) - The evil Falco depicted in the center of the painting at right. Lived in the mid 1600's. A practitioner of alchemy and witchcraft, Falco and his band of outlaws crossed Europe raiding the countryside pillaging religious artifacts believed to bring good fortune. - Scary looking. - Everything scares you. - Look at that one, Ben. The painter forgot to finish his mouth. - Freaky looking. The village painting at the left, Kaya del Sol was said to be the last village raided by Falco before his mysterious disappearance in 1632. - Where do you think Falco disappeared to? - I don't know. - Got you lookin'. - You scared the shit outta me. - Everything scares Ben. - Speakin' of scary, take a look. I swear when we first got this painting Falco's hat was in his other hand. I figure this painting's haunted. How about I show you a nicer exhibit? Probably something more to your taste, Casey. What do you say? - Yeah. - Yeah, come on. Now these paintings aren't as scary as the ones in the Falco room. You know, when I just look at these I get all inspired. - I like them, too. - Okay, well look. I have to finish my rounds so I'll see you two in a bit. - Okay, bye Monty. - Bye bye. - Yeah, I'm inspired, too. - Put those on and you're destined for trouble. (dramatic music) (thunder and lightning) My magician is a good magician. He can make the storm go away or make that mean Falco guy reappear, but as a nice person this time. He could change anyone into anything. - Well, he can't turn me into someone who cares, now can he? - You aren't leaving me alone are you, Ben? - Sorry C, but I gotta check out that Falco painting again. - But, it's haunted Monty said. - Oooo, the painting's alive, Oooo. - Quit it, I'm not going back in there. - You're on your own then. Testing 123. Bye baby sister. The ghosts in the painting are gonna get me. Bye. (dramatic music) - Coffee break? - All right, Monty. Thanks. Did you find my little migraines? - Yeah, yeah. Casey's drawin' away, but Ben he's already got to the kingdom of boredom I'm afraid to say. - That's usually when he gets himself in the most trouble. He always seems to stick his nose just deep enough to get it broken off. - Yeah. - Or get me in trouble trying. Maybe I should go and check on him. I'll be back in five. - Okay. (thunder and lightning) (dramatic music) - Ben, Ben, Ben, where are you? - Don't be such a baby. I'll be back in a minute. - Please save me M. M the Magnificent, he'll be able to do anything. I'll give him a big smile so he can make people laugh. (sound of laughter) (dramatic music) - Are you lookin' at me? - Renaissance paintings, who cares? That one sucks. Modernism, don't get it. Hmm, that's cool. (dramatic music) Case, you gotta come see this now. The paintings, they are haunted. - You can't scare me, Ben. - I'm serious, Casey. There's something really weird going on here. Whoa, whoa. - Hello, Ben. (dramatic music) (rumbling) - Oh, ouch. Where am I? - Yeah, they're flickering down here. Okay, ladies and gentlemen, give us five minutes. We'll have the lights back on, okay? - [Ghostly Voice] You comin' or what? - Yeah, I'm on your way now. Charlie, it's Monty. Yes, how's it goin' down there? (dramatic music) How we doin' down there? I've got some uneasy people up here. - [Ghostly Voice] It's bad, Monty, but I'll do what I can. - Yeah, all right. I'll make the announcement. - Ben. Casey. (dramatic music) (laughter) (rumbling) Oh, oh. Where are we? What did you do this time? - Nothing, what're you lookin' at me for? - Because you did this. - I was mindin' my own business. - I don't know what you did, but this is the last straw. You are grounded for life. - Hey, dad put you in charge, so if anyone's gonna be grounded. - I told you to stay with Casey. I was working, but did you do that? No. - Yeah, but. - I told you not to touch anything. But, did you listen? No. - Kim. - You have no sense of responsibility whatsoever. - Kim. - What? - Do not turn around. - You there, stop. - Run Ben. - Stop. (dramatic music) - Whoa, this is too weird. It's really scary. (mumbling) (dramatic music) - Hello there speed racer. - I think something bad happened to Ben. - No, it's just a mean old storm. Come on, let's go look for him. - What will we tell Falco if we can't find him? - If we find nothing we tell him nothing. - If these guys don't hurt you I promise you I will. - Get a life, come on. - What's going on? What's happening? - I think we're inside the painting. - What? - Inside the painting, the village landscape painting. At the museum did you see that painting of Falco? All the men were gone and I noticed smoke was comin' from the village landscape. Come on. Those two dudes that were chasing us. He must be Falco. He hasn't been around since the 1600's. I don't know how, but somehow this painting's alive and we're inside of it. - Great, so you've shrunk us to microscopic size. Funny, I didn't think your brain could get any smaller. - But, I didn't do this, Kim. When I got to the Falco room the painting was already smoking. I didn't do anything. - Of course, it's always, I didn't do it. - But, I really didn't. - I don't care if you didn't do it. You better undo it because I want out of here now. (scream) - Ben said the pictures were different, then he started screaming and that was it. Look, Monty. It is different. All the people are gone. - I always knew this room was haunted. - Look Monty, an earring. Kim was here, too. - Looks like it. Don't worry, Casey. Everything's gonna be all right. I'm sure they'll be back soon. I'm sure they're just tied up somewhere. - Okay, Monty. (dramatic music) - You know, one of us must have been adopted. - Very funny. - I'm serious. There's no way we both have the same genes. - Believe it and weep, baby, same gene pool and you're from the shallow end. - Ahhh. - Silence child. What are you doing here? Think you'll be able to find it here? Think we, the proud people of this village would just bow down to you and let you have it? - Are you talking to us? Is he talking to us? - I don't know. - Shut your mouths. You tell Falco we won't go quietly and we'll never give up the jewel of Polaris. - He thinks we're with Falco. - [Both] We're not with Falco. - Two of his men were just chasing us. - We're here by mistake. - Oh, you did make a mistake and now you are our prisoners. Danko, look. Look at the capture we've made. We'll be heroes. - Heroes. - Listen, little man, you've got this all wrong. - My name is Palmay, not little man. Palmay. - Okay, Mr. Palmay, like I said. We're not with Falco. We're just a couple of kids that got sucked up in a painting, okay. - That's ridiculous. - Yeah, I know. Maybe I can prove it to you in a a battle of the wits. - Great, emphasize your weakness. - Shut up. But, if I win you have to grand me a wish. - Which is? - Put me in the village still tied up and when Falco's men take me prisoner instead of releasing me, you'll know we were telling the truth. The favor is, you have to let my sister go and help her get home. - Are you feeling all right? - That's my favor to you? - Yep. All the proof you need. - On the contrary, you've proved it already. The battle of the wits has ended before it's begun. Danko, untie them. - I'll tell you what. How 'bout you draw me a picture over here and I go get us some hot chocolate? - You won't be gone long will you? - Back before you know it. - Okay. - Yeah, all right. I'll make the announcement, sure. Ladies and gentlemen, please bear with us. We'll have the lights back on in about five minutes, okay? - [Ghost Voice] Yo, Monty. - I'm on my way. Where are you? (dramatic music) - What's this jewel look like? - It's the most beautiful jewel anyone has ever seen, as big as my fist, a gorgeous emerald, but its power is much more impressive than its beauty. - What can it do? - It can virtually do anything its owner commands. - And that's what Falco's after? - Yes. Whoever possesses the assembled staff with the jewel in place can rule the world. One man did, Lescarus the Evil, whose reign of terror lasted nearly 100 years. No one could stop Lescarus, no one. And when he was finally defeated by a gathering of brave wizards, the leaders of the world decided to separate the jewel from the staff, thereby limiting the collective power. (dramatic music) The jewel was hidden in this very village, home of the last peaceful warlock who possessed the staff. If the staff was stolen a messenger would be sent in the opposite direction of the thief therefore, it became virtually impossible for the thief to beat the messenger back to this village where the jewel was hidden. (dramatic music) Two years ago Falco stole the staff. Luckily we were able to learn of the theft and prepare for Falco's arrival. - That's a really cute story, but we need to get going home. Dad's expecting dinner at eight. - Well, if you're from another world as you claim, only a magician can get you back. - You're kidding me, right? - I wish I were. Darbin, the great magician, was sent to thwart Falco's invasion. That was the last time we saw either of them. At first we thought Darbin was successful as there were no signs of Falco. Now we know the sad truth. - Yeah, and so do we. - So, if Darbin's the only dude in town that can get rid of Falco, then we gotta find Darbin. - Okay. (dramatic music) - Look. (dramatic music) - That's Falco with his hooligans. - Hello, ugly old woman. You see, there's no need for any violence or any suffering at all. There's no reason for faces to look like this one does. Simply tell me where the jewel is and we'll all simply be on our way and your good, honest, boring lives can go on as peacefully as before. Now, we can't get fairer than that, can we? But, if you refuse to tell me the location of the jewel, I will make you suffer more than you've ever suffered before. Boo. (laughing) I understand you fled to the forest when my men confronted you. - We were scared. We don't know anything. - We were scared (mumbling). You see, I think that somewhere in the back of that tiny mind you do. Tell me, where is it? Where's the jewel? - I swear, Your Grace, we know nothing. (laughing) - If you know nothing, then prepare for the education of a lifetime. It's gonna be a lot of fun. You are now my hunter. You will neither eat nor sleep until you find the jewel of Polaris for me and with your size I expect you to look under every rug and beneath every stone. If you find the jewel then I may return you to your normal, we'll talk. Take him inside. And, I suppose you have nothing to tell me, huh? It's an epidemic. This whole village is suffering from tight lip disease. Well, I've got the perfect cure. Give a smile. Oh, you can't. - We don't know anything. Why don't you believe us? - Because someone here in this village knows the whereabouts of this jewel, because I nearly had the jewel once and I will not fail again. Do you know what it feels like to have something so close to your grasp, but not quite reach it? Do you know that agony? I can see you're having difficulty imagining this. Let me help you empathize. Can't quite reach it, you see. Do you feel the madness. I'm just warming up. - I want to just slap that man. - Only Darbin knew where the jewel was. Now that he's gone it seems that we're doomed. - Doomed. - No way. All we have to do is find Darbin. - No, no, no, no, it's too dangerous out there. - Well, I'm not waitin' around here until Falco finds the jewel. We have to find Darbin or some other magician and we're not gonna find either of 'em sitting on our butts in here. - You're just gonna walk right out that front door? - No, I'm gonna get my skates first. I plan on rolling out the front door. - Not me, I'm not going back out there again. - Suit yourself. - Be careful. Tell no one we're hidden here, no one. - No prob. See you later. - No prob, see you later. This is the last time I let you go off on your own. I'm not goin' after you this time. (dramatic music) - Hey, Matthew, run. - Come out, come out little one. - Let's go down here. Here little boy, here little girl. - Dust in this pantry. (dog barking) (thunder and lightning) (screaming) - Man the gates. - I've got it down here. - I want you all to know that we're not going to leave until we have the jewel. Resistance is futile. Take them to the palace jail and bring the others. (dramatic music) - Wipe out. - Ben, are you there? Can you hear me? Ben, Ben, come on, pick up. - Hello. Hello. Casey? Yeah, it's me. - Where are you? - You're not gonna believe it. We're inside the painting, me and Kim both. You remember that village landscape painting? Well, it was smoking and I touched it and I got sucked into the painting. I came out of the haystack. - Ben, I'm scared. I want you and Kim to come home now. - We can't just come back. - Why not? - Because I think the passageway only goes one direction. - No, it doesn't. - Listen, I've got a crazy idea. I think a magician could get us back. Here's what I want you to do. - So, without a village magician how do you ever expect to beat Falco? - Only with the power up here, together with the power down here. - That sounds great, but you aren't actually doing anything up here except for hiding. That's not exactly an offensive maneuver. Sooner or later some of Falco's men are gonna come banging on that door. - Open the door. - I was hoping for that. (pounding on door) - Open the door. (dramatic music) - Hold on just a sec. - Okay, now are you in the Falco room yet? - Yeah, me and Monty both. - Hey Monty, what's up? - Ben? Hey, just sippin' hot chocolate with Case. - Cool, Case, I know it sounds crazy, but it's the only thing I got right now. - How can a picture turn into a real thing? - I don't know. It just can. Hey, you remember that ad for the pizza that we were gonna order? Well, when I came into the haystack it turned into a real pizza. Now Case, look at the Falco painting. - Yeah. - No Falco, right? - Right. - Now look at the landscape. It's still smoking, right? - Right again. But, I just don't know if this is gonna work with one of my pictures. - Casey, it's all we've got right now. So, what do you say? Let's give it a try? - Okay, Ben, here we go. You do it. - Well, how am I supposed to stick it to the picture? - Monty's about to put the picture on the wall. - Wait, wait, wait, don't put it up yet. I have to know what he can do first. - Oh, now you're interested in what he can do. You didn't care before, did you? - Casey, don't give me that right now. We're in big trouble and I need your help. - What? Hello. Ben, you're not comin' in good. I'm losing you, Ben. - Not funny Casey. - Okay, okay. Just remember this when I need a favor. - Anything you want whenever you want it. - Thank you. - Now, I want you to clear your mind. Focus all your energy on the magician. Try really hard to imagine that he knows everything about the world I'm in, and this is the most important part. Focus very hard. Imagine that he knows exactly how we got here and how we can get back, okay? Now, stay focused, open your eyes. Tell Monty to put the painting on the wall. Don't break concentration. Something will happen. - It's on the picture, but nothing happened. - Something will happen. (thunder and lightning) - What do you think, Monty? - I don't know. I think it worked. - Ben, the picture's blank. Did the magician go through? Ben, Ben. - Casey, hello. Did it work? Hello, Casey, are you there? Great, now what am I gonna do? (rumbling) - I wish they'd make these things more in my size. Oh, good grief. Excuse me. Do you know if there's a phone around here? I could really go for some Chinese food. - Is that you, Monty? Are you the magician that Casey sent? - M the Magnificent. - Public speaker. - I give inspirational speeches to company executives, even some presidents. I once counseled Lincoln. I told him that he was takin' his job way too seriously, that he needed to get out and see the yards and go to the theater I said. That didn't work out so well. - And a dancer. - Yes, a little tap, but I'm more interested in interpretative jazz (making musical noises). - You think this is funny. We're in really big trouble here. - Hey, it's just a joke. It's not my fault. Casey's the one that gave me the sense of humor. Excuse me. Yell at her. - Yeah, you're right. It's just that I got my sister and myself in a whole mess of trouble and you're the only one that can get us out. - Actually, you're wrong there. I can't help you. - Why not? - You wanna go home, right? Even I, and don't you tell anyone this, bad for the rap, even I'm not powerful enough to send you back home. - But, I told Casey to make you able to send us back home. - No, no, no, no, no, no. You said, imagine, imagine that the magician knows everything about me and the world that I'm in. Imagine that he knows how we got here and how we can get back home. At no time did you say, make him be able to send us back home. It's all there in black and white. Clear as crystal. Look, only the power of the assembled staff of Polaris can send you and your sister back home. - Oh great. The staff's in the possession of the most evil man on earth who's probably gonna find the jewel of Polaris at which point he'll be the most powerful man on earth. Can't get any worse. - Actually, it does get worse. Do you remember the big bad electrical storm back home? Well, I'm afraid when that storm ends in the real world so will the passage for another 100 years. - A hundred years. Thanks a lot M. Casey. Hello, Casey. Let's just get my skates and go find Kim. - I mean, another hundred years. I know it's a long time. You might wanna get a hold of Casey 'cause that's not my doing. She always. - Who goes there? - What are you lookin' at me for? You're the magician. Do something. - All right, all right, but I'm a little new at this so get back, way back. Voila. - Pigs, that's the best you could do? - I'm just warming up. Give me a little more time. I'll get better. (dramatic music) - Falco's men must have taken Kim. How am I gonna get her too? - Sorry. - Let's recap. I'm lost in another world. I've lost my sister who's either mad and looking for me or has been kidnapped by Falco and my only help is a spastic magical moron. - Hey, watch it. I did that pig thing without a hitch. I could do the same thing to you if you don't watch it. (dramatic music) - Palmay? What happened? - Who's that? - Oh, he's with me, he's. - M the Magnificent. - Knock it off. He's a magician that might be able to get Kim and me back home. - You know, I could make your friend here a little taller. I can't guarantee he'll be a center for the NBA, but with a little magic. - Shut up. Where's my sister? - Falco took her and Danko to the palace jail. - Okay, so how do we get into the palace? - We need to see the village magistrate who's our leader. He's currently hiding in the forest. - Well, what are waiting around here for? Let's go. (dramatic music) - I smell rogues. We better go this way. - No, no, no, trust me, this way. - Halt, halt. - M, take care of them. - M, take care of them? (screaming) - Losers. What took you two so long? - Not bad, M, not bad. - Keep the faith, keep the faith. Palmay, where we headed to? Onward. (dramatic music) - When I get my hands on him I'm gonna kill him. - Ben, can you hear me? It's Casey, are you there? - Hello. - Hey, Ben. What happened? I lost you after the picture went through. - Hey guys, it's Case. Oh well, the good news is it worked and he came through. - I can't believe it worked. What's he like? - He's not too bad, but I don't think he'll be able to get us home. - What's wrong? - I'm in a great deal of pain. - Oh, okay. Well, let me take a look. Let's see what we've got here. - Listen, what's the weather like there? Is it still storming? - It's still raining really bad, but why do you care about the weather here? Are you in some kinda denial? - No, Case. Apparently, part of the spell is that Kim and I have to get back there before the storm ends or we won't be able to get back at all. - You guys have to come back. You just have to. Can I talk to Kim? - Not exactly. - Not exactly? - Well, Kim's not here right now. Actually, she's been kidnapped by Falco. - What? - It's not my fault she wanted to stay in the chapel instead of comin' with me. I'm sure she's all right though. Listen, I gotta go so I'll talk to you later. (dramatic music) - Ah, the mysterious damsel in distress. - Why am I being held here? - I'll ask the questions, dear. - Don't call me dear. - I'm so sorry. It was very insensitive of me. Please. From the look of your wardrobe I'd say you're one of Darbin's sorcerer princesses. Am I right? - Who is Darbin? And, where is my brother? - Oh yes, the young boy with the magic feet, another of Darbin's sorcerer apprentices. Where is your brother indeed? It's a very good question and one I'm glad you asked. Tell me, where is your brother? Dear. - It's not my tongue, M. It's my foot. - I knew that, I knew that. Get ready for eternal foot comfort. Oh, whoa. Let me try that again. - No, no, that's all right. These feet just needed a rest. They're feeling much better, thank you. - No, no, no, no, no, I can do it, I can do it. I can do it. Hokus pokus. - Wow. These are wonderful. They're so light and supportive. - Yes, they are They look good, too. Oh yes. - Smoke, sparks, yelling. Oh, you two are doing wonders for our traveling inconspicuously. - I'm sorry, Ben. But, these shoes are wonderful. - Those boots were killin' his arches. - They're splendid. Please keep it down. Can we go? - Okay, come, follow me. - They're splendid. See if you get a Christmas present from me this year. - Palmay, I was worried. Where have you been? - Hiding. Falco's men have taken Danko. - Yes, I know. Falco is making Danko shovel coal into the palace furnace day and night. Even big Danko cannot survive that. Who are your friends? - This is Ben and M. - M the Magnificent. - You know they saved my life. - Ah, then they are welcome here. Please come in. - Have you got anything to eat? - M, any chance you can turn this into a root beer float? - No. - Falco's rounded up most of the villagers by now. The only way Falco will release our friends and relatives is an exchange of the jewel. We must find it. - Do you have any idea where we might find Darbin? Then we are doomed. - Hey, I can find Darbin. - Son, you don't know the danger out there. - Are you sure about this? - If I can find Darbin, then I can use the jewel as a bargaining chip to get Kim back and get us home. It's a no brainer. Do we have any other choice? - All right, I'm in. But, the jewel alone will not get you home. You need the staff, too which Falco has. How are you gonna pull that off? - How am I supposed to know? Makin' this up as I go along. - You don't actually need to find Darbin, just the map. - The map. - Darbin created a map to the jewel. When he disappeared the map disappeared with him. - Darbin. I think I know that name from somewhere. Casey, are you there? - Yeah, what's happenin'? - Quick, look at the painting. Who's the artist? - It says, A. Darbin. - So the painting must be the map to the jewel. Case, do you see any directions or clues on the village landscape? - Yeah, it's by a rock with all these symbols on it. It's on a scroll that says, look under the roads. - Look under the roads. Great, thanks Case. Gotta go, later. - Under the roads. - There are so many roads to the village. How do we know which one? - Don't look at me, I just work for him. - Under the roads. I got it. It's not under any of the roads in the village, but I know where it is. Come on. (dramatic music) - I thought the clue was under a road. - It is. Like the clue said, under the roads. (dramatic music) Darbin's hidden message. The great jewel of Polaris can be found in a pit. The entrance to the cave can be found 100 paces from the great stone in the woods. - That rock is just a few moments from here. - The direction to walk is that which follows the afternoon shadow. Before reaching the jewel deep in the cave's catacombs challenges await. - Darbin never made anything easy. - Mental, physical and psychological tests must be overcome in order to possess the great jewel of Polaris. - Wow, awful lotta trouble to go through just to hide a jewel. Didn't Darbin know about safe deposit boxes? Would've saved him and us a lot of time and effort. - For anyone less than the strongest, the bravest, and most intelligent mortal shall never exit the cave alive. - Leaves me out. - You gotta give old Darbin points for drama. What do you say kid? - Like I said, no brainer. - All right, but when you get home you tell Casey I want a vacation. No more battles, no more death defying challenges. I want a beach, a towel, a Slurpee. Got it? - Case, are you there? - Yeah, what happened? - I found a map. - Does that mean you're on your way back? - No, we still have a really long ways to go. What's the weather like there? - Monty says we haven't got much time. - All right, all right, I gotta go. Over and out. (dramatic music) - You should find the rock a few minutes beyond those trees. The cave entrance should be somewhere on the other side of the hill. - Please, take care of yourself then. - You, too. - Palmay, I put steel tips in those sneakers, so if anybody gives you any trouble. You know how to take 'em down. (laughing) - Hey, here it is. Circle of spokes, two lines and the shadow, so we should go this way. - Yeah. - One, two, three, four, five, what's the matter? - Nothing. - I lost my count. One, two, three, four, five, what, what's the problem? - It's just that you're not interested in me. You never asked questions about me. Where's my family? Brothers? Sisters? What are my hobbies? Nothing. - M, I'm sorry, okay. I've got a lot bigger problems to deal with right now. We don't have time for small talk. Have we not stopped once since you got here? No. Look, as soon as we get some down time we can chat and you can tell me your whole life story, okay? - Well, I am an only child from a place called Ishing. It's like Cleveland only the weather is better. My hobbies, well, my hobbies include, I love synchronized swimming, playing the dulcimer and strategic needlepoint. - M, I just lost my count again, so if you'll please help me out here and be quiet? - I'm all out of quiet, but I think I can help. 98 paces. So, the entrance is very close. - Found the entrance, huh? - So, are you comin' or what? - You laugh. No thank you, no great job M, just laughing at my expense. I don't know why I do it. Come on. Oh, my back. (dramatic music) - This may have been a mistake. - Yeah, tell him that. - Can you get this thing to work? - Now I'm the department of power. I can tell Casey got all the imagination in the family. Here, hold on to that. Lantern, lantern in my sight, give us a little light. Voila. - Okay, one more time. After I get the jewel and the staff, then what do we do? - We go back to the barnyard where all this started. I place the staff into the haystack and poof, away you go. - Cool. - Maybe cool. Remember it'll only work if it's still storming outside the museum. Let's go. (dramatic music) Let's go this way. I've been wrong before, but I have a good feeling about this way. (mumbling) - Hey, check this out. These stones probably have something to do with the challenges Darbin wrote about. What do you think M? - No question about it, Ben. - What do you think all these weird symbols are about? - I have a feeling we're going to find out pretty soon. (dramatic music) - [Ghostly Voice] Only intelligent pass in, thinking freely and able to use the sixth sense will know which stone would come next in the sequence and therefore, should be placed in the hole. - An intelligent person with a sixth sense? What's that supposed to mean? - I think ESP is the sixth sense. Maybe you should wait til the stone talks to you. - The next stone in the sequence. - I think it's the last one. It's simple like the first one. Maybe they're like bookends. - I don't know M. Maybe the clue's in the instructions. - Let me see. (rumbling) I don't think I was supposed to stick my head in the light. - What are we supposed to do? I can't leave without the jewel. - Maybe if you pick the right stone it'll stop. - A sixth sense, a sixth sense. - Come on, come on. - I don't know. - Just pick one. - I got it. Yeah, a sixth sense. First stone, no broken lines. Second stone, one broken line. Third stone, two broken lines. Three, four, five, six, a sixth sense. Thank you, thank you. - Bravo, bravo. - No more calls please. We have a winner. I'll be signing autographs out in front of the cave in a half hour, so please tip your waitresses and good night. - And a good night to you my friend. - Uh oh. - What's that? - Uh oh, what'd I do? M. - Align the door. The door Ben. - M, M, can you hear me? - Ben, can you hear me? - M, can you hear me? - Go on Ben. I'll meet you out front. - Okay. (dramatic music) - I'm really gonna do this. - Case, can you hear me? - Yep, loud and clear. - M and I got separated. What's the weather update? - It's still thundering, but it's stopped raining. Ben, are you okay? - No, I'm not. I'm really scared Casey. - Oh Ben, I wish I was with you. - Great, room service. Compliments to the chef. I think I ordered the brown slop, not the green slop. But, thanks anyway. (dramatic music) - [Ghostly Voice] You have entered the final chamber. Only a mortal strong of body and mind shall pass the ultimate test. To get to the jewel of Polaris you must prove you are worthy or die trying. (dramatic music) - They went in the cave? - Yes, Your Grace. - Oh goody. We've got them. (dramatic music) - Benjamin Scotound, you get me out of here. - Uh oh, busted. - I wouldn't do that if I were you. - Who is that? - It is I, Darbin and who are you? A boy who has successfully reached this room looking for the jewel of Polaris, I presume. - Yeah, my name is Ben and I'm lookin' for the jewel. - Do you wish to have it so you can use its power? - Yeah, but I'm not gonna use it for evil. I came from the future with my sister and we accidentally arrived the same time as Falco. - Falco, I banished him to the canvas. - Yeah, well he escaped. - Ben, you are not in here by accident. You were sent here to help stop Falco. Without you the village and the world will not survive. Your future will not exist if Falco takes over the present. You must help them. If you do you will help yourself. - I just don't know if I can stop Falco. - Close your eyes. Open your mind. Open your heart. Now open your hand. The jewel of Polaris is yours. - Thanks Darbin. - I'll take the jewel. - Where's M? - Your crazy friend is Falco's prisoner. He said when he gets his magic wand back he will turn us all into turkeys. Give us the jewel now and we won't kill you and your friends. - You want the jewel? Sure, no problem, go fetch. (dramatic music) - You're okay now Ben. We've got a plan. - Your friend has evaded my men and is in possession of the jewel. - He's not my friend, he's my brother and I don't care what he has. - Well, I hope he's more cooperative than you are because if he doesn't give me the jewel by sunrise tomorrow will be your final day. - Could we eat first? - Shut up. (dramatic music) - Hey buddy. - Sorry M. - It's okay. It had a warranty. And I still have the receipt. - Quiet. You may have bested my guards, but your friend and your sister are still my prisoners. If you give me the jewel I will not harm them. In fact, I will set them free. Now you can't get fairer than that. - Don't do it Ben. - Listen to Kim, Ben. He'll never stick to his word. - First, set them free. Then, you can have it. - Ben, no. - My pleasure. - He's good. - Now, give me the jewel. - You must promise me you'll never use it for evil. - No evil? You're asking a lot. All right. It's a deal. You. - No, Ben, no. - I give you my word. At last (laughing) foolish child. Evil is too kinda word for what I plan to do with you. Oh I'm glad you find that amusing. - Lookin' for this? Or this? Falco, you're not wanted here or anywhere else. I send you and your men back where you belong, back into the painting. - No. (upbeat music) - Quiet please, thank you. That was very nice. Palmay. - Thank you magistrate. We want to thank you Ben for saving this village. Please kneel. We award you with our Medal of Honor. - Thank you. I wish I could say my trip was wonderful, but it's been a little crazy. First of all, I'd like to thank Palmay. Although he's a little person he's got a really big heart. And finally, I'd like to thank M the Magnificent. Without his help we would not be here. With his guidance it helped me find the jewel that will forever protect your village. M, I'm sorry I lost your wand. You can say something, but please leave your cursing out. It can take a little while to get used to it, okay. - Thank you, thank you one and all. I'm so glad you're here. It gives me great pleasure to say. - Casey? - Absolutely nothing. - I've got Casey. - Casey. - Ben, Falco and his men are back in the picture. What did you do? - We did good, Case, real good. But, we don't have time to talk about that right now. Is it still raining there? - No, I think the storm is over. - Listen carefully. I want you to draw a picture of a lightning bolt, a quick one. Put it on the village landscape. Do it now and if everything goes as planned we'll be home soon. - You got it. One lightning bolt comin' up. - Roger that. Come on guys, let's go. Sure hope this works. - Ben, thank you again for saving my life and the village. I'll make sure that your memory is never ever forgotten. - I'll never forget you man. M, I don't know what to say. You made it all happen. Without you I was lost. - Don't sell yourself short. You made it happen. - What happens to you now? - I become an X-Files episode. - Cool. - Now, you be sure to tell Casey hello for me, okay? - Okay. - Now, get the heck outta here. - Okay, cross your fingers. Oh, spit it out. - I send these two into the passageway, back into the place from where they came. - Where are those guys? I don't get it. Ben, Kim, are you there? Do you hear me? (dramatic music) - Oh. Oh man, that was one wild ride. - Casey. (screams) - [Ghostly Voice] Go ahead and do something. - I guess we can thank M for that huh? - I could've died. I'm so glad you guys are back. - Ben, I'm proud of you. - You're proud of me? Did you hit your head? - Hey, don't push it. - What's with the jacket? And the pretty necklace? - Thanks for watching over her while we were gone. - Yeah, thanks a lot Monty. - My pleasure. There was no watching over her. This little lady can take care of herself. - Hey, it looks like we are having pizza for dinner tonight. - Yeah, pizza, pizza. - [Narrator] Falco met his match and was finally defeated in the village down below. As the legend goes his reign ended when he was outwitted by a young boy with the help of a great big magician. (laughing) (dramatic music)
