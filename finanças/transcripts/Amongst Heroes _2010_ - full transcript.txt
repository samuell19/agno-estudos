Central Partnership Russian Post Aeroflot Russian Airlines movie company "A1 KINO VIDEO" presents IGOR PETRENKO In summer of 1944 the enemy was pushed back to the western borders of the Soviet Union. Parts of the German 13th army corps, which included the division SS "Galician" that was composed of Ukrainian volunteers, were surrounded by the Soviet forces near the town of Brody. That encirclement was called the "Brody cauldron". By July 19th the "cauldron" was closed shut. From 21st to 22nd of July the Germans attempted to break out. Fierce battles ensued. As a result of counterattack by Soviet infantry and tank units the SS "Galician" division was almost completely destroyed. A year later the Germans restored the SS "Galician" division, but it never again fought on the territory of Ukraine. You are being given the opportunity to take part... in a reenactment of this battle. I remind you that the flight to Lvov is today at 17:45 from Pulkovo airport. And don't be surprised to find out that over there you are Moskals. ["Moscal" is a derogatory term referring to Russians used in Ukraine.] I'll be right there. Just a minute. Who is there? Hello, you should have been notified. I am Vasiliev. Oleg Vasiliev. - Hello. - Yes. Come in please. So you are a pathfinder? Or... how do you call it? Doesn't matter, I do excavations. Collect war artifacts. - Sit down. - No, thanks, don't have time. Here, Galina Victorovna, our people were digging not far from Lvov and found this. "Hello, my dearly loved wife?" "Your Nikolai." So this must be my grandfather's last letter that was never sent? It's dated July 19th, 1944. On July 22nd he died. WE ARE FROM THE FUTURE 2 See who is in the photo? - Nina. - See the shoulder marks? - Shoulder marks came only in 1943? - So? This means... It means that back then in 1942 she survived. She was not killed in the blindage hut, understand? Sergey! Are you alright? Glory to Ukraine! Glory to heroes! A-a, hello! - Some beer, bro? - Thanks. Seryi, don't lag behind! Moskals! Go hang yourselves! Did you see that? Don't get involved with them. It's not even clear what they're doing here. Idiots! I did not want to, but... - Come over here! I'll show you... - Easy, easy! Tell me your last names. To beat someone up no need to come to Ukraine. - Your last names? - Filatov. - Yours? - Oleg Vasiliev. I am Maria. You've been assigned to the 4th infantry platoon. You'll go to headquarters right now and talk to senior lieutenant Terehin, he'll fill you in on everything. But why so formal? Maria! Maybe just Masha? What city are you from? I am "Masha" for my mom and dad, for you I am comrade sergeant. Angela from Ryazan. Sergey. SOS me, somebody... Should I go to the disco like this? Out on a hunt, right? - You'll get cold. - Really? Alright. What about you? Coming? Whatcha reading? "Brody Cauldron." I see. Keep reading then. I'm off. Hande hoch! Ha-ha! Russki partizan? Is your ammunition also made of wood? But the rest is all real. Seryi... should we take her hostage? - Yes. - What? Exactly. Listen, Nazi... Take your hand off! Hey there! The war hasn't started yet, guys. Let's dance. So, comrade sergeant, how do feel about men with a great body? I prefer men with a great intellect. Is that so? What if there are both in a single package? Never seen such. You are lucky. He is before you right now. Sorry! Oleg, don't get involved! Oleg! Guys, what's with you? I'll kill the bastard! Scoundrel! - I'll kill the bitch! - Give it to him, guys! Watch out! Moscals are beating up our guys! Let them have their fun... Let's get out of here. Let's go! Damn, I'm bleeding like a hog! Have nothing to wipe it with. From dirt? What if I get blood infection? Enough! Are you nuts? Did you confuse me with a Moscal? Who do you take me for? You're momma's little boy. I was told to look after you, so that's what I'm doing. Who is looking after who! What's your problem with that Moscal? What did he do to you? You won't understand me. Everything is great in your life. You have all the money! The university! The car! - The nice condo! - Is it my fault that my dad is rich? Who wrecked my Bentley last year? Was it not you, Taras? It's alright. We'll deal with those Moscals yet. "To those fallen in battle under Brody." "Eternal memory." "Melnik." Melnik - is that your grandfather buried here, Seryi? No, my grandfather was Mikola. And this is Melnik I. Maybe "Ivan." Damn invaders. Faster, soldier! Right here, next to Brody, on 22nd of July the Germans tried to break out of encirclement, and by morning they were already here, advancing on the 1st Ukrainian front. Take your position... - um, comrade? - Ober-lieutenant Vitsyk. - Take your position and wait for order to attack. - Yes, sir! Let's continue. I am telling you, just go talk to her. ... and the Germans, together with the remaining troops of "Galician" division, came to the military crest. It could be seen from everywhere. With the price of their life Demin and his soldiers did not let Germans break out of the encirclement. Excuse me, please, my last name is Filatov, I am a representative of the St. Petersburg University. Please allow me and my friend to go to this exact location. Where? With what friend? With... captain Vasiliev. Filatov, at that location there is an abandoned house, in the reenactment we must take control of it before the Germans. So... No. Before the arrival of Demin's battalion... there was not a living soul there. We can't change history. Join the ranks! When is your line-up? Don't know yet. Here in 1944... our fathers and grandfathers have lost their lives... for the freedom of homeland Ukraine. Here they embarked on last break out attempt and accepted heroic death. And today the future of Ukraine depends on you. Now I guarantee you that the Moscals are getting their pants wet. With a grenade you look like a human being. Where are they going? So where are we going? I don't get it, what are we doing here? The fighting is down below. Sergey! - Do you know who fought to hold this position? - Who? Demin and his men. What are you thinking? Sergey? Miracles don't happen twice. Besides, the first one was enough for me. Let's slowly walk down this hill... and go kick some ass. And go home. Crazy. Crazy. - A bomb. - What "bomb"? You are sitting on a bomb. Get up, only slowly. I'm not intruding? Long live free Ukraine! Death to Moskals! Have a grenade! Taras, brother. Is that you? - No, this is your Moscal brother! - What? - Nothing! - Where is Taras? - I'm here, here. Moscals! You see anything? Not more than you, Khokhols! - Taras. - What? Are you tied up? What do you think, Seryi? We are all tied up here. Damn it, guys... I don't get it... if we won, then you should be the ones tied up. If you won - then we should be. Then who is holding us captive? Really? - What do we have? - Four more over there. So, gramps, did you catch many today? No, not really. Two commies. - And two seem to be ours. - Seem to be? Their uniform is German. But they talk like us. Well, let's take a look at who you brought in. - Mihailo, bring them in. - What do we do with the commies? - Finish them off. - Got it. Not right now. Later! First bring in the other ones that seem to be like us. Seem to be like us... As you say! Let's go. Get up! Goodbye, brothers, we won't forget you! Why did you yell that right now? What's wrong? Only joking. Take it off. well, good day to you... guys. Good day, Mister! How brave you are! Where did you so brave come from, sonny? From Kiev! From Kiev itself? And have you been here long, "from Kiev"? We arrived the day before yesterday. If you came the day before yesterday from Kiev, then how come you are wearing our uniform? - What do you mean? - That's what I'm saying, how come? Who dressed you in our clothes, if Moscals are in Kiev? Mister, I do not understand you. Kiev is a Ukrainian city. You don't say? And how long has Kiev been Ukrainian? Since the year 1991. Did you go nuts from fear? Is this lad a brother to your Peter? He's just as much of an idiot. That's enough. So we are going to have Kiev only from 1991? Why not earlier? What are you laughing for, Mister? Moscals broke away from us themselves. Ukraine became independent. And before that we were ruled by Moscals? Of course! Wait a second, Grisha. Tell me, lad, what according to you... year is this? What do you mean what year? How do we take this crap off? I have a feeling, Oleg... that your stupid joke will turn our badly for our "brothers." Take a look. See? Not again? You have given us quite a laugh! We need to drink to that. Untie him! Thank you, I don't drink vodka. A non-drinking man is either sick or is a scoundrel. Drink! Maybe you are not Ukrainian? Maybe you don't like our salo (bacon) either? Enough! Why are you silent? Where did you come from? From Lvov University. - What year is it right now? - 1944. That's better! Why are you dressed in this uniform? - I am from Galician. - Galician? Pan lieutenant, I overheard the two commies calling them their brothers. No, no, no... They said, "Goodbye, brothers!" - It didn't happen! - What do you mean didn't happen? I heard it myself. - Long live free Ukraine! - Long live, long live... Only without you, damned commies! Shoot them all! Oleg, this is the UIA - Ukrainian Insurgent Army. And I thought they were Soviet partisans. What's going to happen to us now? Not clear. Move it! Don't push me! You'll be sorry about this! You don't know who my father is! My father is a deputy of Supreme Council of Ukraine! - Seryi, shut your trap! There'll be trouble. - Shut what? Give me my mobile, bitches, I'll call my father! Quiet! Why stopped?! So, is it Stalin kaput? Grisha, wait. We need to test these lads. There are no people in here, only commies here. And those... who help them. So prove... that you are for free Ukraine. Oh, gramps Mikola! What a theater you've thought up! - Go on! - And watch them! Because maybe these lads will shoot at us! - Well! - Go on! Shoot! Don't shoot us! Do it! - Pissed your pants? - Go on, shoot! Do it! Watcha staring at? Prove that you are one of us! Now we will see, are they your brothers or not. Come here! - Go on! Go on, shoot! - Go on! Shoot! Shoot, I tell you! Either you shoot them, or we shoot you! Well! I give you three seconds! Well! Shoot, I tell you! One! Two! Three! I won't do it! Then get in the pit! Laden! Feuer! Laden! Feuer! Are you alive, lads? Why standing? Let's get out of here! Faster! Faster! Faster! - Faster! Faster, lads! - Run faster! [song by Okean Elzy - "Vische neba"] I can no longer see anything No longer feel anything, I am not myself anymore. Another day has ended and this means You will soon go. And my life will end. Will it always be this way. Hey, at least don't go today. And I feel myself falling into the sky, I fall into the sky, and there is no end to it. And I need to stop somewhere, But I have less and less strength, And you are long not yourself any more. Will it always be this way. Hey, at least don't go today. Higher than sky, Higher than sky. My dear, how can I be without you. Why don't you let me into your soul? Higher than sky - Why do you fly so high? Wait up, lads! Can't run anymore. Don't push me! I can myself! Guys, we can't stop, we need to keep running. - Let's go, bro. Let's run! - He's not your brother! Got it? If that's so, then go join your brothers over there in the pit. Go on! We go right, you go left. Goodbye! - Where are you going? - Over there! Everyone, listen to me. We'll have our disagreements in the 21st century. Got it? And in order for us to return there, - ... we must stay together. All together. - I get it! What 21st century? Isn't it 21st right now? What? You haven't realized? It's 1944! Mother of... ! - What am I gonna tell my mom? - Your mom hasn't been born yet! Hande hoch! - Hands up! - Freeze! Finally! What are you staring at? Don't understand Russian? They told you "Hande hoch." And you, Nazi bitch, get your hands up... Everyone, hands up! Put Bandera's men in the barn and bring these two in for questioning. Yes, sir! Keep moving! We are in Ukraine, and it's July of 1944. Lvov-Sandomirsk breakthrough is the topic of my dissertation, I know every single page of archives by heart, so you stay quiet, I'll do all the talking. Got it? Well... Who are you, from where, where to? 102nd Rifle Corps. I am sergeant Borodin - the driver. This is... captain Golovkov, deputy chief of staff. We were taking the chief of staff, colonel Samoilenko, from Brody to Zolochiv. Bandera's men ambushed us. They threw grenades at us. Samoilenko was killed, but we were able to escape. - We captured two prisoners, as you saw. - I saw. You talk well. Could we have some tea? Where are your documents? We buried them. In case we get captured. I see. Hello, 16th? Lieutenant Martynov. Give me the update on the 102nd Rifle Corps. Yes, both for yesterday and today. I am interested in colonel Samoilenko, - sergeant... - Borodin. ... Borodin and captain Golovkov. All the best. I'm waiting. Why is the driver so talkative, but the captain keeps silent? Well... he's shell-shocked. I see. I told you he's shell-shocked. I believe you. That was quite a punch he gave me. The damn Slav. In your 102nd Rifle Corps... does everyone have this? What a fancy life the men of colonel Samoilenko have. Mischyuryaev here. Yes. Thank you, Kanonenko. I owe you half a liter of alcohol. Good news, fighters. And news from the hospital. Colonel Samoilenko is seriously wounded, but he... is alive. Really? But his deputy chief... captain Golovkov and his driver sergeant Borodin... are lying dead next to him. It turns out that you don't exist, soldiers. You are dead men. Comrade senior lieutenant. Your archives! When we get back, we'll correct it. American dollars? - What else could I bring to Ukraine? - What did you forget about? This is not nice. Rubahin! - Yes, sir. - Write. Write, Rubahin... Today, on 21st of July... of 1944... Comrade captain. - We will tell you everything. - It's senior lieutenant. - Just please believe us. - Well? We are from the future. You have two airplane tickets on your table. Check the dates. Check the dates. I'm a historian, I teach at the St. Petersburg University. To the wall! Your espionage school didn't train you well. We don't have any St. Petersburg. We have the city Leningrad. What does it matter! Today the Germans will break through the encirclement. Maybe they have broken through already. They will go through Demin's defense line to reconnect with their forces. This you should write down. There will be a terrible battle. Call forward communications. Call them. Quite nice. Hipko, bring here their companions, those Bandera men. Yes, sir! And you, Rubahin, write, write. Call forward communications! - Guys, we're not joking here! - We're not either! Names! Last names! For what purpose were you sent in? Oh, you bitch! Quiet! Throw down your weapon. Yeah, guys, this is cool. Cover your nose! Nesterov! I have some men here from headquarters, they need to drive to forward communications to major Demin. Sure thing, comrade senior lieutenant. Thank you for the uniform, comrade senior lieutenant. We'll meet again, you can be sure of it. Open your mouth. So. We are going separately. We already have prior experience of such travels back in time. The four of us came here, the four of us must go back. No other way. - We can only go back together. - Then untie us! Untie us. Sorry guys, but that will have to wait. Hello, men! We're looking for the 14th infantry battalion. Well we are from the 14th. Do you know Demin? Major Demin? I know him, he's our commander. You need to go there, then right and down the hill. - Thank you. - Good luck. I don't get it, where are we going? We need to go back, not hang around the front line. We'll just warn Demin... ... and then go back. Really? We've done a fine job warning Smershev's men already. Let's be honest. You are looking for Nina and not Demin. - Honestly? - Well? Demin. Listen, Moscal, untie my hands. - What? - Untie my hands, I said. You can wait. Freaking Ukrainian! If your bro didn't throw that grenade, we'd be sitting in the future right now enjoying our bacon. And say thank you that we saved your lives. - Thank you. - Well, thank you, thank you! Pull it up! Let's go, let's go, let's go! Go, go, go! Wow. Hello beauty, where's the medical unit? Over there. Turn around. [song by Okean Elzy - "Taka yak ti"] Do you know How hard the merciless rain is pounding on my soul? As if it has always been waiting only for me. How much it hurts, the winter calm of our window. The soft pastel, just like in the paintings of your favorite Monet. One like you Happens once and for a lifetime From heavens above. One like you Is once and for a lifetime, I never stop regretting, When I am without you. Oops! Sorry, comrade senior lieutenant! I've been so much around front lines. Comrade Jukov awarded me twice, shook this very hand of mine... This very hand... he shook. Filatov! Hello, comrade maj... Cut it out! Filatov! Filatov! Alive! I probably never could forget everything, A new call destroys all willpower. And your single gaze - it is worth more than a million words, Eternally far and distant, just like your favorite Dali. One like you Happens once and for a lifetime, From heavens above. One like you Is once and for a lifetime, I never stop regretting... Filatov, wait! But you were ...? Bye, Nina. Bye. Listen, maybe you can take Nina Andreevna with you? If it's not convenient, then tell me so. - It's convenient. - That's great then. I won't have to worry then. You guys are reliable, you'll protect her. Right? Which direction are your cannons pointed? Over there. The Germans have broken through the defense, they'll be coming from there. You must quickly go with the senior lieutenant. You don't worry. Everything will be okay. It just has to be this way. As soon as everything is over, I will come right away. Take care. You take care too. Alright go. Oh, you must take a right here. What a fool. I really thought that you were from the future. And I thought that you had died back then in the blindage hut. Do you at least love him? Stop the car. Who's the woman? Damn it! Did you call a cab? Get up. Where? Faster, faster. - Stop idiot! Where are you going? - No, no! Into the car! No, no! Don't! Into the car fast! Hands, hands! Oleg, help! Take the wheel. C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, Oleg! C'mon! Let's go! Let's go, let's go! C'mon, c'mon! Faster! Get in! Keep shooting! Keep shooting! Ammo. Need ammo! Ammo! Where are they? - Germans! Germans! - Germans! Run! Germans! Just got report that a BTR is on its way here. - Also tanks and infantry there. - How many? Don't know. Connection was cut. What do you want? Please, help. She's giving birth. Come in. Come in faster! C'mon. Get out of here, Nazis! But he is ... one of us, a partisan. Just disguised. I'm one of you. So. Quickly go to Mikola, third house on the left. Get alcohol. To arms! Faster, men! Turn around your weapons, or we'll get blown to bits! Load! Move it, dear men! Move it! Ammunition over here! Where are you aiming? To the left! More left I said! Aim at the German tank, direct aim... Follow me! Nicht schiessen! What "schiessen," a woman is giving birth! Give here alcohol! There's war going on, and some people are giving birth! Out of their minds completely! - Take it. - Hey you, get over here! Didn't expect it, swine? Get up! Get up, I said! Go, go! Dad! Go! Ammunition! It's time to go back. Where? Where you, fool, threw that grenade. Where's the map? Where's the bag? Go to the yard, bring water. Go. Why does it always have to be me. Get back! Where are you going? Oleg, stop! Stop! Why are you hiding here? - Machine gun. - Where? Get back! Oleg, get back! [song by Okean Elzy - "Taka yak ti"] Do you know How hard the merciless rain is pounding on my soul? As if it has always been waiting only for me. One like you Happens once and for a lifetime From heavens above. One like you Is once and for a lifetime, I never stop regretting, When I am without you. Well, gramps, get ready. Stop! - Run! It's getting blown to bits! - Sergey, faster! Don't shoot! So where are we going, Seryi? He knows where. Gramps, are you sure that is the very place? There is only one house like that. Trust me. So we're here. How do we go back? Don't worry, we'll get back. We'll just sit here and wait till a bomb falls on us? Do you have better suggestions? But why? In any case we can give it a try. Don't get angry at me, but it's not going to work. - Why? - Because it's not realistic. But why, have you tried it? You're an adult man, you teach at a university, you should understand these things. If you change something in the past, then the future will be changed. Just imagine: you and Nina make it to the future but you're no longer there. A catastrophe. If Nina stays here, then I will stay here too. Ouch! Sorry, but leave me out of this. I need to go back to the future. Masha is waiting for me there. Good girl Masha. And my motorcycle. I'll take her and the child. Why the hell are you so stubborn! To top it all off, as senior-lieutenant Misyuraev would say: "This is not nice, Sergey, to steal the wife of another man." That is not right. Oleg, don't offend me. You know very well that Demin will get killed. I know. Comrades officers! - Hello! - Hello! Parts of the German 13th army corps have actually broken through the encirclement. Your information, major, turned out to be accurate. The German avant-garde has been broken up by an attack of our air force near Suhodoly village. But their main forces... are continuing to advance in our direction. Their numbers are at least 6,000 persons. If they take control of height 3575... Where a house stands? ...then their total breakthrough will be inevitable. How many men do you have, major? 560. You must hold out till the reserve forces arrive. Where is Nina? - There. - She's not there. What's going on? Keep sleeping! - Nina! - Sergey. Sergey, please don't yell. Germans and Bandera's men are nearby. - Nina! - Sergey, don't yell. Sergey. Nina! Nina! Nina! Nina. - Sergey. - Where are you going? Please, let me go. I must be with him, understand? Please. - Listen to me. - No, I don't want to hear anything. - I know that he will not die. - Nina, listen to me. Everything has been decided, Nina, we're going back together. What are you saying?! - You just want him to get killed. - I don't. I just know. Let me go. Let me go. Everything has ended long ago, I just need my child and my husband. I don't love you anymore, Sergey, understand that. Nina! Oleg, take the baby. You woke up! Who is waking up here? The sun is out. We're all going back to the house. It's warm and safe there. Take him back to the house, Oleg. What's up? Quiet. Shh-shh. Untie me! Are you not human beings?! Go, go, go! Whatcha staring at? Go save the little lad! Demin is his last name! Demin! Where are you going? They'll kill you! Let me go, my baby is there! Run! Run! Quiet, quiet. Sergey. My baby... I'll be right back. I'll get him. Taras! Taras! Taras. Taras! Tara... Taras! Taras! Taras! You should get out of here with that child. There are... Germans there. Comrade major, allow me to report. In about half a kilometer from here gunshots were heard. Catch up! Nurse. - Take the child, alright? - Sure. Remember, his last name is Demin! - Heard that? - I heard it. Demin. Achtung! Flugzeugen! Turn me over. - What? - Turn me over, it hurts. Bitte nicht schiessen! Freundschaft, freundschaft! Nicht schiessen! I will find the baby. Sergey? Get arms ready! Go! That's it, can't go no more. Let's stay here till it ends. Guys said... the exit is same place as the entrance. So we must go there. And what if it doesn't work? Then my friend... nothing will ever work. I am not scared. I'm not either. Go. Go. Why not moving? Fire at their flanks! Go forward! - Are you alive? - Yeah! Why are you here? Get into the house! Vasiliev? Why are you here? Well... - Cover me. - Go! Put him down. Where's the baby? Where's the baby? With the medical care unit. You have a son. What about Nina? - She is alive. - Comrade major... ...there are so many of them! Nina... Hold tight, guys. This is not the time to die. Nina... loves you. Where's Semyonov? Who has seen the radio operator? He was here somewhere! They are surrounding... So, does anyone want to throw a grenade down there? Ha? Don't wait for it, it won't work. That bomb will go off only in 65 years. So are we all going to die here? Semyonov! Damn! Nest! Nest, this is Falcon! Reporting, the height is ours. Can't hold it down long. Germans are coming on strong. Send in Katyusha rockets directly on me! Write down the coordinates: square 40... 60, height 115, landmark - the house. Fire. Guys, where are you from? We... are from the future. Sorry... but could I use your mobile? I have to call my mom. Hello. Were you looking for me? I am Ms. Demin. [song by Nochnye Snaipery - "Armiya"] Above the earth the seas sleep. Underneath me the earth sleeps. In foreign languages... 70 soldiers of my very own army are seeing dreams. In foreign languages... 70 soldiers of my very own army are seeing dreams. I will order them to sleep well and get ready for war. I will order them to prove that reality is to blame. I will order them to sow overcoats and scrape their boots, I will order to feed them from the palm of a mother's hand. I will order them to wait till morning, When fire floods the fields, When the horizon explodes, And resistance becomes futile. When they realize How fragile their bodies are, I will order to kiss... Those who have died because of love. I will order to kiss Those who have died because of love. Vertical rise of a bayonet, Hair-raising fear. There, where ships are being set aflame, Waiting for him are The 70 soldiers of my very own army. There, where ships are being set aflame, Waiting for him are The 70 soldiers of my very own army.

I will order them to wait till morning, When fire floods the fields, When the horizon explodes, And resistance becomes futile. When they realize How fragile their bodies are, I will order to lay to rest... Those who have died without love. I will order to lay to rest Those who have died without love.
