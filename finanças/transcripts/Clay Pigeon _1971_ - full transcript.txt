(gun firing) (gun firing) (soft instrumental music) (whistling) - Hey Boyd. What do you say? It's me, Joe. What do you say? - Joe, how are you Joe? - All right, how you feelin'? Lookin' kinda big, got a stain on your tie. - Yeah, I leaned into a Playboy Bunny. Pretty embarrassing, I'm not kiddin' you. Well Joe, you're back, huh? Not much to come back to, is it? Business is lousy, money's tight. The market's practically disappeared, it's a ball-breaker, Joe. Of course, not as rough as what you went through, don't get me wrong. Listen, Joe what are you doin'? You got a job, anything? - Well, I'm just kind of you know, driftin' around. - Just driftin' eh? - Yeah. - Well Joe, good luck. I've gotta go now, I've got to take care of a big brassiere merger. - Hey listen, Boyd, I'm sorry you got in so much trouble then. - You well, thanks. Listen Joe, now when you go for a, could you maybe get a. Listen Joe, you know, it'd make a better impression. Good luck. Listen, I can explain this guy. - I owe you some bread, pops. (helicopter running) (gun firing) - And these are prints on file. So, we got a make on your man. - Congratulations, Frank. - Four years, Mac. Four goddamn years, Athens, Berlin, Paris, New York, Amsterdam. Every time we'd make a move, he'd make a move. And all we have is a name and no face, until now. - We got Eddy the Informer here so we control that. You picked up those prints in New York. Our friend Walter here's getting him a face. The beginning of the end, Frank. - No face. - What? - There's no information on the way he looks. No pictures, no face. - No face. - Let me see that. His name isn't Neilson, it's Tallin, T-A-double-L-I-N, also known as McCoy. Born, Tsing Tao, north China coast. There was a marine drop during World War II. Hard drugs used as political weapon. Columbia riots, Tokyo, follow student protests, blah blah blah, we know all that. Now believed to be operating in the United States again on the west coast, possibly Los Angeles area. - Well, that narrows it to six million people. That should be easy. - No face, no goddamn face. - Frank, find him one. Go out there and find him a face. Make one up, steal one, I don't care what you do, but find him a face. Neilson, or whatever the hell his name is. He'll have to come out and find out what's happening. (whistling) (light instrumental music) - Oh, I'm sorry ma'am. Sorry. Have a nice day. Freedom? - Huh? - Four bucks. - Four dollars? That comes from an MGT 200, they only made 14 of 'em. - Four pesitas. - Hey, this isn't the age of obsolescence, that'll last you forever. And besides, it cost me five dollars. (chuckling) - You got yourself a deal. I want, I want to show you something. How does the world look to you, now you've fought for it? - [Joe] I don't know man, I'm expecting too much I think, you know? It's really tough to get into. I can really dig walking on sidewalks that don't blow up in your face. Or a little air that doesn't smell like gun smoke. But I don't know, Freedom man, I can't figure out what the hell's going on. Why is everyone so uptight? - [Freedom] I don't know, they've thrown away the things that really made 'em free. Now they need 'em again, they can't find 'em. You still carry that metal around in that bag? - Yeah, still do. - You know that there's a shop there at Santa Monica, where they sell these things? Navy Cross, Medal of Honor, Purple Heart, that, anything that you want. They got it, and they sell it. - What are you trying to say? - Nothing except that, you never told me what you got that thing for. - Yeah, I know I never told you. - All right. - For dying. - For what? - I got it for dying. The grenade forgot to go off, under my stomach. It didn't explode. See I'm here on loan man, and I can really dig it. You know, a dead man sure can enjoy life if he's livin'. - That's heavy. Look who's comin'. - [Joe] What do you say, Saddle? - I was just talking about you. - You were, huh? - And whom is that funky old man? - You'll kill a man like me. (laughing) Better go back between his legs, where a Saddle belongs. - You dirty dude. - Thank you. - Be with you in a minute, Ray. What you been doing? - Anybody I can. - Listen, we had a good old thing going there, why can't we do that again? - I don't know, why can't we? You still dealin'? - Sure, beats what I was doing. I'm at the Climax, I'm a DJ there. - Far out. - That's Tracy. And this is Joe. - Hi Joe. - Tracy. - Have I seen Angeline with you? - No, no. - I gotta split. Why don't you come by the Climax tonight? I got a newy for you, a brand newy. A surprise, I promise you, you'll really dig it. - Okay, all right. - House, far out. - Come here. Here. - You're givin' it to me? - No, I ain't givin' it to you. I get it later. - How much later? - Later. - That little fox can't be more than 15, 16 years old. - And thus, I can't give away a hat? - See you in jail. (light music) - What, in the Hudson River? Three times in the chest? Who did he meet? What was he doing in New York? - He was carrying something, Mister Neilson. It's in here. - What is it? - How the Christ do I know? (blues music) (lyrics muffled) - Hey Joe, you're not here to see my sister, are you? - Yeah. - Thought it was all over between you two? - Yeah well, she wants to introduce me to some girl. - Just cool it, huh? - You gotta lighten up, man. - Just cool it, man. - Okay. - Hey man, I'm glad you came by. Yeah, I'll keep some bread on the table. - How come your brother's so heavy? (muffled speaking) Yeah? Saw Tracy out there. You a doctor? - Sort of. - Yeah. (laughing) That's funny, man. Love Saddle. (blues music) - [Joe] You gotta get some lessons, man. - Sometimes I do it. - Yeah. - You think you'll see Angie again? - I don't know. You never know. Maybe. - [Woman] Hey Joe. (laughing) - Newy, huh? - That's the newy. - Should have taken it. Pretty, Ange. - Thank you. You sure gave up easy. - Too much tension, had to split. - Joe, could we go somewhere? - Of course, the sooner the better. - I'll get my coat. - Yeah. - Tracy wasn't wearin' my hat, huh? (blues music) (muffled speaking) What'd he say, he made a hundred bucks a night? - Right. - Not bad. - Right. - Say, would you like to get high? - Oh I'd love to. - Yeah? Well, tell you what we'll do, if I find the joint. - Oh good. - Remember, it's illegal. - I know, says what I'm thinking. - There's a reward for a beautiful kiss, sent you with a golden joint. - Thank you. - What made you get high? - You did, you turn me on. - Yeah. - That's why I wanted to see you again, because I wanted to tell you about it. When you were in Vietnam, I think you had an advantage. I mean you learned to live for right now, right this minute. You didn't have time to think about tomorrow. You didn't have time to think about what happened yesterday, I mean everything is now. And when you came back, that's what you tried to teach me but, I was so busy being jealous, possessive, worrying about our future, and uptight about the grass that, you just couldn't wait around for me to get my head straight. I just blew it. - No you didn't. - Oh Joe, I still want you mouth on me. (traffic passing) I gotta go. - Gotta go? - Yeah. - Where? - I have a new job. - A job, you don't work in a bank anymore? - No. I work for from midnight to three. - Midnight to three? - Yeah, and seven till 10, I'm on my break right now. - Seven to 10, you're on a break, what do you do? - I'm a go-go dancer. - A go-go dancer? - At the Classic Cat. - The Classic Cat? - I dance topless.

I got a question for you. How did it feel waiting for that grenade to go off? - Who are you anyway? - I got a job for you. - Man I'm busy whitewashing jails. - You do the job and you can forget all this. - Ah man, I'm here on a 7-21, it's only seven days, you can't muscle me with that. - Well, the police charge would be a 7-21, but I'm not the police. And I don't use their rules. How about a 4-11? You remember that one, don't you? Cop. Two years for starters, and after that they can't even find you. - No deal. - [Frank] You haven't even heard the deal. - Yes I have, a thousand times. Get yourself another pigeon. - You're, you're slang is a little dated. - Is 'fuck off' dated? - I'm taking him out in the morning, for a couple of hours. - All right, I'll give you two men. - I got my own men. - Mister Redford, he's under arrest. - I know that, Captain. - Well if you lose him Mister Redford, it's up my sweet Irish ass. Sure he's the one you want? - Captain, do you know the level of heroism it takes for a man to receive the Silver Star? - Mister Redford, I'm going home. I'm tired, and bored. For me, law is an accommodation for the people. For you and your friends, people are an accommodation for the law, your law. - Fair enough. - If I don't cooperate with you, it's my job. But I deal with my conscience. Either way it costs me. I hope your Mister Neilson doesn't take the bait. - He'll take the bait. It's a risk but we've got nothing to lose. - No, just a life, Mister Redford. Just a life. - [Eddie] Frank, go out there and find him a face. (man laughing) - [Man] Rex, bit off the tip of his tongue. Now we wedge his mouth open. You see, some of them don't get this far. Withdrawal puts a terrible strain on the body. Two fatal heart attacks this month. That's Tad. Do you know how dehumanizing it is to put your child in a cage? She locked him up in his room for three days. Couldn't understand why he refused food. She was gonna bend his arm, cold turkey. Instead, he stuck a broken hanger in his arm. Hanger was still stuck when they brought him in. (woman singing) (screaming) - [Joe] How long does it take to cure them? - Well, let me give you some statistics. I work here 15, 16 hours a day, six days a week, with Sunday (muffled speaking). And for that, we get a 1%, 1% no return. And you know what, because all we can do is clean them out, give them all the reasons why not, and then we let them go right back to where they started, into the waiting arms of the guys who sent them here in the first place. - [Joe] If that's the case, why are you beatin' your head against the wall? - [Counselor] For the 1% who don't come back. - No! Help me, help me! No, not again! No, please! Please, they want to kill me! Please, please, no! - Yeah, will you get me the hell out of here? - [Woman] No!

Kids gettin' killed in the jungle over there. Kids gettin' killed in the jungle over here, huh? What the hell's the difference? - One man is the author of all that misery, Joe. - Yeah, well he got a bestseller. - And he's responsible for all those clinics, too. You know I've been after a man for four years, and up till now he hasn't made a ripple? - You a Treasury man? - No. - [Joe] You some super-narco cop that I don't know about? It's not everything to do with narcotics. It's above the local police level. - Joe, we're gonna need your help. (laughing) - I'm out of help. - So those kids? - Yeah. I know, but I'm finished with that cops and robbers routine, I pass. - So what happened back there had no affect on you, right? The fact that the elimination of one man might bring that no return figure up to 10%? The fact that literally thousands of kids could be saved? That's unimportant to you, right? Just let them die on smack and speed, because you bigshot, you pass. - Damn it. You know what put the X in cop? Good cops being sent to Siberia, bought judges, police with their palms out, corrupt politicians that don't or won't tell the people of this country what the hell's going on. Boy you're naive in a lot of ways, super-cop. That scene back there tore my insides out, and I was in a bloody good-for-nothin' war. And second of all, even if you did catch Mister Hard Drug, he'd get three to five, while some poor kid in Nevada, Texas, Alabama, or some other state in this country, is gonna get five to 10 years for possession of a roach! Which in case you don't know it, is the end of a marijuana cannabis joint. Now Mister Hard Drug'll be back on the street in one year for good behavior, while that kid, who don't know how to buy off that judge who's on the take, is gonna have five years of his life, of his youth, taken away for smoking something that isn't even a drug. Now you listen, super-cop. When you can guarantee me that Mister Hard Drug gets the electric chair, or the gas chamber, for feeding kids under 18 smack, speed, or any other classified hard drug, I'll knock on your door and help you nail him to the wall. Until then, I pass. Do you understand? I pass! Now take me back to jail. (light rock music) (audience applauding and cheering) - Excuse me. - Yeah. Don't worry about a thing, he's getting out Saturday. Yeah, yeah. He can come out Saturday. It's a seven-day bust. Now Eli, this guy that works for me, he got the call. I was out getting loaded, and he was in, getting loaded, and he forgot to tell me until about an hour ago, so I'm sorry I didn't let you know. - Don't be sorry, it's okay. I was just afraid, maybe I lost him again, you know. So, I'm glad everything's okay. - Yeah, don't worry. Say, what do you get for this kind of work? - 10 dollars an hour, 60 a night. - 60 a night? You kidding? Do they need any man dancers? I mean I'm a pretty good dancer, and I'll show anything for that kind of-- - No you don't. You're adorable. - Did he agree? - No. - He turned you down? - We're gonna spring him tonight, Captain. I want you to let him escape around two or three o'clock in the morning, and I don't care how you do it. - I beg your pardon? You're drafting him into your war? Setting him up, and he doesn't even know it? - He'll know. - Well needless to say, I won't spring him. I don't approve of your methods one goddamn bit. You throw your muscle around as though you're God. You don't even care if you infringe on a man's right to make his own decisions. You order, he has to do it, your way, no questions asked. Well let me tell you something, Mister Redford. From the Bible, if you affect my life, I will surely affect yours. - Are you finished, Captain? You all through with your little speech? Well let me tell you something, and probably not from the Bible. Quite by accident we stumbled upon a dingaling with a great deal of ability. I want to use that ability. I want to arouse the conscience in this freak-out, in order succeed where you and I have failed. And that's to arrest a malignancy, Neilson. You've seen fit to ridicule and to criticize, and to preach to me, Captain, because I disrupted the propriety of your precinct, or because I'm not using your orthodox methods in the face of a despicable, unorthodox situation, then let me tell you something. You're a goddamned fool. Wake up friend, it's time to go. - Look, I told you, I pass. - [Frank] Get up Joe, come on you're free. - Look, I've got five days more on a 7-21, and I'm beginning to like it here. - I fixed it. No record, it's all vanished. I just want you around. Well come on, take your scruples and go. Goodnight. I'm sorry to wake you, Mac, but the pigeon's been released. Yes sir, the morning paper. No no, not a chance, everything's covered perfectly from here. - Redford, you son of a bitch, you broke about 47 laws. - [Man On Radio] Charlie here, pigeon at horn, still headed east, out. - And Neilson'll be watching by noontime, trying to dig it all out. - Redford. - Okay Mac, thanks a lot. Yeah, goodnight. - [Charlie] Pigeon opposite Althy's, looking for a tow west, out. - Redford. - Oh just a minute, Captain. Station here. Pigeon opposite Althy's heading west, looking for a tow. - [Man On Radio] 10-4, out. - What are we gonna discuss this time, Captain, constitutional rights? Invasion of privacy, freedom of choice, your family, your job? What'll we start this time with, Captain? (horn beeping) By the way, I've released it to the press, and I've also released photographs of our pigeon. - [Man On Radio] George here, pigeon towed. Old Navy Porsche, WUY 293, out. - Station here, get the tow? - [Man On Radio] Got it, '58 navy Porsche, west on Sunset, out. - What do you suggest I say to the press? - Well I suggest that you say, you have nothing to say. You don't, do you Captain? - [Joe] Hey, thanks a lot, man. - [Man] Good fun, I'll see you Trace. Bye bye. - Bye. (crickets chirping) (blues guitar) - It isn't much, but you're welcome. - You live out here? - When Saddle has plans, I come out here. There are other kids around. They're all runaways, under 18. Kids really help when there's none of this, in a lonely setting. Want some? - I'm gonna tell you something. Smack'll kill more than the lonelies. I'll take you some place, some time. Don't tell me you became a runaway so you could shoot smack. - No, I ran away because of the 'don'ts' and 'if you don'ts'. It all adds up to no trust, no love. - How do you know? - I don't really, but when you don't feel any love, and you don't feel the trust, and after a while when you ask why, and they keep saying, just because, you don't respect your mother and father after a while, no matter how much money is thrown at you. - The life with mother Saddle is better? - She takes care of me, you know what I mean. (crickets chirping) - No, I don't know what you mean, what do you mean? - I'm a slave to the pusher. I wash her clothes, take care of her house, make love with her, to her, whatever she wants. Now you understand? (crickets chirping) Hold my hand, Joe. Oh, you look so pretty. So pretty. It's all black. Never seen it so black. (horn honking) (tense instrumental music) - Now we know what was missing from that package in the Hudson River. - Do we? My name isn't Neilson, you idiot, that's the cover name. It doesn't make sense. What does this guy want anyway, a cut? Check it out. Check it out! - Hi. - Hi. - I missed you. - I missed you, too. I went through a few changes. - I know, I think I know more about it than you do actually. You seen the papers? I couldn't eat after I read it. It took the place of breakfast. Well, I always wanted to be a syndicate broad. Henry Neilson, that's a super name. Do you use any others? - Yeah, 'sucker' and 'clay pigeon'. - Papers say you're a pretty important guy. Why the hell don't you dress a little better? With your kind of money both of us could be in Acapulco, we could be seducin' starlets. - What's that? - That's a self portrait. - I need your buggy, old bastard. - The buggy's for sale. - You already owe me five dollars for the fender. - If you're that bad, I'd better lend it to you. What else? - There's this dude named Redford, works out of the West Hollywood police station. I don't know much about him, except he's not a cop. 190 pounds, six feet tall. He doesn't have hair one on his head. If you find out where he's livin', leave it on your service. - What else? - Heard of this guy, Neilson? - Nobody has. - Yeah, I know, because if they knew who he was, they'd grab him. - You mean, they're using you to get him? - Right. And they're watching you and you and me, and everybody else. So when Neilson finally comes out to find out who he is, there's gonna be a lot of trouble. - That's nice, that's a nice one.

I'm your friend, honest. - Uh uh. - Why? - You're fuzz man, that's why. - Fuzz don't have friends? - You almost smiled. - Fuzz don't smile? (chuckling) - I've never seen it before. - Look, we're on the same side. Joe's in trouble, and I'm not it. - Who is? - Someone who'd just as soon kill him, as shave. - They're after Joe? I'll tell him you're looking for him. - You'd do him a great big favor if you'd tell me where he is. - He wants you, he'll find you. - Want a lift? - I changed my mind. I think I'll stay home and read. - Oh, what are you reading? - The Prophet, you ought to try it some time. - Oh, I have. Prophet? - The collision of tender eyes, and soft lips. The mysteries of spurious flight, to the realm of fantasy must forever remain elusive. Yes. (bird cawing) Gentlemen, there is nothing better for one's mental energy as spending 20 minutes a day in the atmosphere of the jungle. - We have some news for you, Mister Neilson. - Yeah, it's just been confirmed by Ed. The cards are mixed up in Washington. They really think that jerk is you. (chuckling) Now, about the guy himself, he's gone underground. He's some kind of a retired vet. He wears a medal to prove it. - Friends? - All we can finger is an old wiggle sculptor, a very young girl, and a couple of chicks. - What do they know? - We haven't talked to them yet. - Talk to them, and listen to me, and listen well. I'm not offering a hundred dollar bag, I'm not talking about a half an ounce. I'm talking about an ounce of pure smack. - An ounce of pure? - That's right. And the man that cuts it it'll be worth 50,000 dollars on the street. Get him. And now I must take the last five minutes, the most important. For the mental images. (bird cawing) What was I saying? - You said, "Spurious flight to the realm of fantasy "must forever remain elusive." Yeah, it's good. - Well, what can I do for you gentlemen? - Yes sir, we'd like to talk a little business with you, sir. - Business? Good, good, we're always open for business. What kind of business? (laughing) - Well, we're looking for a guy named Joe. - Joe who? There are a lot of Joe', Joe Palooka, Jo-Jo, the dog-faced boy. - You'll have to give it a little concentration, old man. - Uh huh. - Curly hair, bushy beard. His name is Joe. - Joe, no I'm sorry, I don't know any-- (voice speaking on intercom) (phone ringing) - [Intercom Voice] Doctor Walding, please call operator three. (phone ringing) - Well well, how we feelin' tonight, Mister Loveface? - Lovelace. You think I'll be able to pitch tonight, Doc? - The only pitchin' you're gonna do, is to the nurses, Loverlace. (laughing) - You hairy bastard. How'd you find me here? - It was easy, you're on the radio. You're big news, baby. - You mean I'm a celebrity, now? Now listen to me. Your man, Redford, Holiday Inn, 407. - Thanks. - But you're nuts coming here. They dropped me here. It's a setup. They'll be outside. - Hey Freedom, I'm sorry. - Oh well, what the hell? If friends can't get involved, might as well get a new management for the store, huh? Boy, they tore me apart. And I'm not even the man, you know. You are. They ain't givin' out medals for stupidity this time. - Yeah, that was pretty stupid, wasn't it? - Mm-hmm. - You know, I'm beginning to think that jumpin' on that grenade, it's like the guy that sells his car in order to get money for gas. - You'd better split, because they're working their way through your friends, and you are next. Split. - Yeah. See ya at the store. - Yeah. (siren blaring) (acoustic guitar music) Where the hell is Angie? - She must be on her way to the club, she goes on in an hour. - Well, where's Tracy? - She went back to the commune. - The commune? - [Saddle] How's Freedom? - [Joe] He'll live. The question is, are we gonna? We gotta get out of here, all of us. Do whatever it takes, get yourself together and meet me at the house. (acoustic guitar music) (humming) (gasping) - My lucky day. - Let's walk a little, huh? - I've already told your friends, I don't know where he is. (laughing) - Is that what you said? Well, we've got lots of friends, right? - I'd say we do. We have a lot of friends. We're lucky that way, aren't we? - What is a man without a friend? (laughing) - Nothing, nothing at all. - I have a daughter about your age. Bright girl, but pretty. My Denise is 14. Has long blonde hair like yours. Although you're more mature. She gets the braces off her teeth next week, she's pretty excited about it. - What are you going to do? - One question, one answer, we'll go. Where's Joe? - He's not my guy, I don't know. - You know, you're gonna be a beautiful woman. My Denise was voted the most cooperative citizen in her high school. You be nice, Tracy, we'll let you stay a beautiful woman. - Please, I want out. (slapping) - I haven't any idea where Joe is. Please believe me. Don't kill me. I don't want to die. (crying) - I do wish you'd spare us this unpleasantness, my dear. (birds singing) That was a California Tanager. It's a very rare bird, indeed. Speak to her, Simon. - Maybe she really doesn't know, Simon. - Maybe, the world's full of maybes. Tracy, honey when Mister Neilson goes to look at birds. - Tracy, where's Joe? - Sweetheart, you've got a choice. Dreams, or bubbles. It's up to you. (crying) - Oh my God. (muffled speaking) - Daddy? - Yes, baby. - You love me? - Yes, I love you. - Mommy? I'm sorry, Mommy. - What are you sorry about, Tracy? - Didn't know each other, did we? Till (muffled speaking) Tracy. I loved Mom. - [Woman] I love you too. You'll be all right, baby. - I didn't tell them, did I? - No, you didn't tell them. I'm very proud of you. You're a good girl. - Am I? - Yes. - Do you love me? - Yes. (dark piano music) You're a very good girl. (light instrumental music) Merry Christmas from a dead little girl. Where were your boys when Tracy got it? Shakin' down some poor teenager for a joint? Life's expendable isn't it in your job. Tracy didn't mean a thing to you, huh, you dirty bastard. I thought there was a reason why that grenade didn't go off. There was no reason. It was a fluke, that's all. - You need help, Joe. And we can do it together. - Together? You know what together is? God and country, mom and apple pie? Blood and murder! Indifference and hate. Take your pick. There all together! - You're reciting your own epitaph, Joe. You're not in the jungle anymore. (dark piano music) I never left. (blues music) (lyrics muffled) - Hi sugar. - I've been expecting you, Simon. - I'm happy then. I've been looking all over for you. Hey, I got something for you, the stuff that dreams are made of. If you can dig it. - Yeah, I can dig it. - Come on, let's warm up first. Dance with me. - I really shouldn't, I got a date with me. - Break it. - All right. (blues music) (audience applauding) (rock music) - Put your hands down Joe, no flag wavin'. Don't attract any attention. Stand still, I'll tell you what we're gonna do. First, the gun Joe. (yelling) (crowd cheering) - What are you doin' here? Who do you think you are? - Take it easy man, just take it easy. - Listen man. (muffled yelling) (screaming) - Joe, I'm gonna lose my job. What are you doing? - Angie, Neilson got Tracy. He smashed her up, overdosed her, and she died. (crying) - Yeah, yeah come on. - Do you have something for my head, please? (laughing) - Come on, Saddle, don't panic. - I'm not panicked. It's my head that's panicked. (laughing) - Saddle, there's a fellow used to hang around you. Shaggy headed, playboy with a beard, you know. What's his name? Joe, Joe. - That's Angeline's, not mine. I don't see him. - Angeline. Well, I just hadn't seen him around lately, I just kind of wondered if you knew where he was? - No. Why would I know where he is? - You don't know. - No, I don't know. - Okay. - Simon? - Yeah baby. - Give me something to make me feel good, and I'll give you something to make you feel good. - I've got something to make you feel good. (laughing) (screaming) Saddle! Where is he? - I don't know. - Saddle, that's pure. There's a full ounce where that came from, with your name written on it. Where is he? (screaming) Saddle? - I'll tell you. He's at the old house, at the end of Vista. (gun firing) - It's gonna be all right. (door closing) (gun firing) (gasping) (gun firing) - Well bowled. - No (muffled speaking). (tense music) - Hey Mister, Neilson? Neilson! - You stupid. (gun firing) Get him, get him you dumb bastards! (flute music) (eerie music) (tense music) - Shooting near the bowl. - Yes sir. - It's our pigeon. - Yes sir. All right, no noise, no sirens. He's an ex-cop. He's one of us, you understand? (people chanting) (chanting) (guru muffled speaking) - [Guru] You are hand-in-hand with love. (guns firing) (people chanting) (gun firing) (yelling) (screaming) (gun firing) (gun firing) (gun firing) (guns firing) (tense music) (tense flute music) (gun firing) (gun firing) (guns firing) (splashing) (water rushing) (tense electronic music) - It'll be all right, Joe. - Nothing's gonna be all right. You son of a bitch. (explosion) ♪ When will you get it together ♪ ♪ Everybody in this land
