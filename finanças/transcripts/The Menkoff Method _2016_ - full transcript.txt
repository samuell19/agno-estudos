Morning, Philbs. This is David Cork. He works for Endobank, a once successful bank, now in decline. David Cork is a data processing assistant, level 2. But actually, he's an artist. A comic book artist. - It's manga. - Ah. - So tell me, David Cork... - Uh, yes? ..who's the hero? Foxy Chaos, seventh daughter of the Storm Nebula. Spreading love throughout the second universe. And who's the bad guy? You've got to have a bad guy. Senior Customer Relations Officer. - And you live in New York? - Yeah. It's beautiful. - And you? - Endobank, Australia. Guy Curry, head of Business Banking. - Your CEO spoke earlier. - Yes, Clive Struthers. Impressive. Perhaps a little conservative. We should be doing twice the business. Our data processing centres are inefficient. We need to be far more aggressive. - You mean reckless. - I mean ruthless. There's a difference? I can show you later, if you like. - I don't think so. - Your loss. I think I'll say hello to Clive. Every Tsar falls one day, Mr. Curry. Excuse me? Max Menkoff. I can help you. Business is revolution. Revolution is business. Menkoff Management System's revolutionary system can deliver increased productivity and efficiency gain for your bank. - Mm-hm. - Total commitment. Total engagement. All staff. Look, this is all very well but I don't have the authority. Don't you want success? I can offer you success. Performance-enhancing regime with minimal adverse side effects. - Clive would never agree. - Clive is not important. If only that were true. I can get rid of Clive. It's part of Menkoff Method. First, PowerPoint. Then we talk. One moment. Room service! Da, da, da. Da, da. Here, please. Please. Aargh! Catch! Business rival. Well, that's not strictly correct. Max Menkoff is an evil genius who stole money and deadly Polonium 210 from the United Mongolian Bank. And they want it back. Look, I just came for a presentation... Sidet! Please. I have PowerPoint. Hmm? Menkoff Method - unique, once-only opportunity to improve your bank's performance. Our success speaks for itself. National Bank of Ragastan - before Menkoff Method, no profit. After, 360 million rubles in first year. Menkoff Method - all data processing workers receive injection of supplement. Better staff performance equals better profit. You can have wealth, success, respect. Sign up now to Menkoff Method. Alice, make sure that includes CMEs this time. Yes, Phil. David. You fixed the database yet? Uh... Okay, no, you haven't. I already checked. - Got an ETA? - Thursday. - Thursday? - Thursday morning. Or... today? - Uh... - Make it 11. After 10, before 12. Get a thesaurus. Template database printout on my desk - 11, okay? Can't be done. You'll need Mynix. You'll need Mynix. Mynix is down. I'm working on it. But yeah... ...Sorry about that. Gary Barrett. IT. Short-term contract. Just get it done. When you can. And stop doing whatever it is you're doing. Or you'll be talking to Marjorie. I use Mynix every day. There's nothing wrong with it. Is now. Can be for as long as you want. Us against them, mate. Hot chick. Smoke? Uh, no, thanks. - No, no, I-I don't smoke. - That's a bit antisocial. I'm not a very social person. You don't need to smoke to take a break. Marjorie doesn't allow breaks. Yeah, I'm sure she doesn't allow cartoons either. - It's manga. - Of course it is. It's huge in Japan. I'm entering a contest there. 'Foxy Chaos'. Oh, hey, Dave. Um, I just brought in some biscuits and thought maybe you would like some biscuits too. So I've got some for you here. Would you like some? Biscuits? Sure. Thanks. - I don't mind comics. - Hey. - Morning, Mr. Curry. - Morning... Ruby. Did you two have a good trip? I did. Great trip. I was hoping to include your report for the board meeting. - I have Clive's. - Of course you have. You know, it's not all about pieces of paper. No! No, I understand. We need to move this bank into the 21st century. And you can be part of that. I'll see you up there. Ruby. Good weekend? Yes, thank you, Mr. Struthers. - Harold. - Clive. - Guy. Dubai went well? - Certainly did. So what do you get if you win? Uh, they publish the winning entry. And you get an internship with Takuya Fujimoro. A samurai? No, the creator of Foxy Chaos. - He's a master. - Ah! Cool, man. Please don't get ash on that. Bet you you give good Excel, though, don't ya? Hey? Shit-hot spreadsheets. I bet you it gets Phil nice and hot under the collar, hey? Huh? What a shame, life isn't a comic book. I mean, what's it really all about, Dave? Is it really just all about sex? You got a lady? Biscuit girl. She seems keen. - Who? - Ah, me neither. Too career-focused. I'm a singer. 'Gary Barrett and the Instruments of Death.' You can keep that. - Hey, good luck. - Thanks. Hey, Trev! How you goin'? Since you been fired. Help me, Takuya Fujimoro. You're my only hope. Get out of my cubicle! - Get out of my cubicle! - Trev. - They made me move. - Wait. - I liked my old cubicle. - Get out! This cubicle was my life! Ah! Oh, shit! Fuck! Trev... Melting Moment? You'll be fine, Trevor. - Insider trading. - They are just allegations. By whom? The evidence requires us to investigate the matter. This is absurd. I'm sure they'll come to nothing. Until that time... ...I've no choice but to stand down. I appreciate that. One piece of advice. Don't even think of making him acting CEO. - I don't think it's app... - He's not up to it. - Excuse me! - You're not up to it. Sorry. Harold, you know me. I'm sure you can see this is nonsense. Our hand is forced. For heaven's sake, I told you I'd step down. The king is dead. - Long live the king. - Na zdrowie! The pilot program is all yours, Max. - And then, the full rollout. - Thank you, Mr. Curry. We are very happy to be here. Our method is simple, yet effective. Svetlana, Karpov are experienced practitioners. I welcome you to my country. Your supplement program is groundbreaking. It could make all the difference. Please keep in secure location. Uh, yeah, what is it? Most of my recipients become very good workers. Some - very few - have negative reaction. Not many. Supplements make them like zombies. This will reverse. It is, how you say, antidote. - Uh, what? - Please, keep safe. In wrong hands, could destroy all our work. Okay. Pretty numbers, Max, pretty numbers, I can sell anything. - Just make them pretty. - Of course. - The Menkoff Method. - Menkoff Method. Now, I'd like to avoid this becoming some sort of worker's compensation situation so, um, I can offer you stress leave. If you wish? Though, we're seriously understaffed. Would you like, um, stress leave? Uh, no, I don't think so, no. Alright. Good. Good. Now, a counsellor? I can offer you a counsellor. A good one. - No, that's okay. - Ah, good. The bank is here for you, David. If there's anything that you might need... We do wish to contain this situation. - Anything? - Well, within reason. I'd like a 72-set limited edition Copic marker pen pack. From Japan. They're quite expensive. Oh, sweetie! Oh, sweetie, sweetie, sweetie, sweetie... Mummy's here. - He's had an eye operation. - Hmm. Poor little thing. Oi-oi-oi-oi-oi-oi-oi-oi! We'll see what we can do. Thank you. If you could just sign this here for me. What you did today, David, was very, very brave. Now let's never speak of it again. Go out, have a drink. You'll be fine. Fuck, take that mask off and stop drawing comics. Place is crawling with Endo workers. - Corporate chicks from HQ. - They're not comics. Put it away. Mate, you're a hero, start acting like one. - I shouldn't even be here. - And put that away too. - Fuck me! - I have a deadline. Karaoke time, ladies and gents. Just shut up and drink. Relax. First up... Gary Barrett. Watch and absorb. Ah! ♪ Workin' hard to make a livin' ♪ Bringin' shelter from the rain ♪ A father, son left to carry on - ♪ Blue denim in his veins? - Get a real job, mate! ♪ Whoa... ♪ He's a workin' class man? Shut up! Hey, none of that! - Off! - Ow! - He broke the foldback! - I'm sorry. Can I just... - Get off stage! Off! - Let's get out of here. Excuse me. - Get him out! - Can I finish my song? - Oh, my shoe! My shoe! - You're grabbing me, mate! Mate, I just wanna finish me song! - Wait. - Come on, mate. Stay out. My shoe! I left my shoe behind. Let me guess - Cinderella? Mr. Curry? - Mr. Curry? - Hmm. Sit. So, you're with the management training program. You'll be shadowing me. We need good, sharp minds in the bank. I came through the MTP myself. Ah. First of all, anything you see or hear in this office is strictly confidential. - Hmm? - Of course. Second, you will not discuss anything related to DPC2 with anyone, least of all board members. Past and present. Third, any correspondence from a consultant named Max Menkoff - emails, calls - is really, really confidential. - Understand? - Yes, Mr. Curry. And if Rita or Heidi call, tell them I've been transferred to Dubai. - Permanently. Uncontactable. - Yes. Actually, don't write that down. Right, of course, Mr. Curry. Call me Guy. Yes. Now. - Guy? - Relax. Watch and learn. - Is that all? - Is that all... Guy? Right. Of course. Guy. Bye, Guy! Look, this may come as a very big surprise to you, Mr. Menkoff, but I have been with this bank for 25 years. I have outlasted eight CEOs, five rebranding exercises, two mergers and a hostile takeover bid. Y-you cannot just fire me. Ms. Werne, I served in Afghanistan in 1980s. I see many people get 'fired'. And dogs is not acceptable. No. Mr. Menkoff, this is not Afghanistan. And if you touch my dog, I will set the RSPCA on to you. Who? Da? Let me make myself very clear. In English. Redeploy me or I will report you to the Fair Work Commission Tribunal for unfair dismissal. Very well. You will proofread every document in system from June 1987 to today. You'll log all typographical and grammatical errors. You will report daily progress update to Svetlana directly. One hundred document per day. Failure to meet quota three times, you are dismissed. - That's impossible. - Take her. So to get the girl - employee database. The mother lode. Tonight, when it's quiet, just start going through 'em. Everyone's got a mugshot but it has to be my computer. - Hey, Dave... - Pretty busy, Louise. Yeah? Has to be my computer because of the admin privileges. Not just a simple case of breaking a code. No, this is a bank. Security is paramount. Para-mount... MENKOFF, OVER PA: Workers of data processing center #2, Credit Card Application and Approval Division. My name is Max Menkoff. I am here because you have failed. We must repeal workforce plan. Then review. I will make change. Do not resist. Compulsory vaccinations will commence today. But now, please, enjoy some cake. Password. - 'Barnsey.' - Okay? Workforce reviews? What is that about? At least they've got cake. Davai. Gospodi... Sidet! Who is he, Charlie? Ah... Who is he? Ooh, Charlie. We've got ourselves a doozy. If all else fails, polonium 210. My insurance policy. Ooh! Ruby Jackson. '75, Clowes Street, Prahran.' Ah! - Charlie. Hello, David. - Hi. Charlie, Charlie, it's okay, it's okay. I can give you a lift, David. You'll be pleased to know I received a purchase order for your pens, and Finance sent off a wire transfer to the manufacturer in Japan so... Great. ...should receive them in about five to ten working days. Thanks. You're going to drive, are you, David? Oh, sorry. - You alright. - Uh, yeah. Just think we should go. Something weird is going on up there. - The water coolers? - All of them. - But she didn't see you? - No. Oh, that Mr. Menkoff, he's an elusive man. His methods are questionable, probably illegal. - Maybe he's KGB. - Well, he's certainly not HR. We need to go to the police. Oh, what, and complain about a consultant? Please. No, if you see anything else, you come directly to me. Or if I'm unavailable, straight to Head Office. Mr. Menkoff may have the DPC but we can always go over his head. - Who to? - The top. Mr. Menkoff has no idea who he's dealing with. Consultants come and consultants go, believe me. No, it's Head Office... or me. Direct line. We've got the bank's reputation to think about. I'll give you my number too... Oh, David. I know everything about you. Fury love. Happy power. Oi! Enough! - Hello? - Uh... Hi. - That's my shoe. - Uh, yes. From last night at the pub. And a rose. - Rubes, who is it? - It's just some guy! You didn't think a rose might be a bit creepy? - How did you know my address? - I-I work at Endobank. At the DPC2. But I'm actually a manga artist. I draw Foxy Chaos. And you were dressed like her so I-I thought you must be a fan as well, like me. See? I-It was a dress-up party. I hired the last costume there. What's your name? - Uh, David. - Ruby? - Cork. - What's going on? Who's this? - Uh... - What's your name, bro? David Cork. Thank you for the shoe. Brought my shoe back. - Amelia! Enough! - Jason, your dog! - Amelia! - Jason! Hold her! - Down! Stop! - Stop her! - Jason, pull her back! - Desist! Idiot! I fucked up, Philby. I fucked up. Sensei Fujimoro, I have something to show you. I have already seen. You are eighth son of the Storm Nebula. Do not kill the child to become the man. Do not eat the breeze. What? Foxy? Yes? Don't drink that, it's spiked. I must finish work plan. - What? - KPIs will be met. Gary. I found her. New data. Must upload. - The girl... with the shoe. - Shh! 'Bank-owned life insurance.' All these people. Beneficiary - Max Menkoff. The patient's going to need a full blood transfusion. Yep, and can you include an I&R with that? Brilliant. Thanks very much. Right, love. You wanna just take your jacket off for me? Your jacket. You want to just take it off for me? Alright, here we go. Oh, I didn't sign a consent form. Oh, don't you worry about that, darling. We're all friends here. It's just a compulsory vaccination. A consent is a regulatory requirement. It's procedure. Hello? 'Need consent'? It's an offense under workplace health and safety legislation to administer a vaccination without the explicit written consent from the employee concerned. Look, I'm just doing me job. Not only are you in breach of National Health Practitioner Regulation law but you're exposing the bank to potentially significant liability. I will raise this with Mr. Menkoff. Whoa! Alright, love, I'll tick your name off. You just take yer fuckin' lollipop and go. - Language. - I'm Glaswegian, woman! What the fuck did you expect? Phil... Phil! No. Phil. Phil. Phil! - Name? - David. David Cork. You look tired. - Why you tired? - He draws, Mr. Menkoff. - He always draws... - Shh! Answer! You have not had vaccination. Take him away. Watch him. We cannot afford problems. Alright. Off we go, come on! Bad reaction. He needs antidote. No, no, no, no waste antidote. It's no problem. He looks alright. - Uh, can I have that back? - No, come on. Wait, wait. Wait! Yes, Max. Yes, Max. Yes, Max. Okay. Go on. Go on. Okay, I do it right now, Max. Don't worry. - Hi. - What is it? I-I need to get an injection? Aye, well, I'm meant to be knocking off. And I need a fucking cigarette. Look, I'm coming back to cover people on leave. You'll have to make an appointment. Well, go on! The books are there. Go put your name down. Ah, Jesus, it's only a vaccination, ya stupid little shite, no big fucking deal. Attention all staff, this is Max Menkoff. Report immediately to car park evacuation point for compulsory callisthenics with colleague Svetlana. - That is all. - 'Avoid vacc. Need consent' That should work. Excuse me, Marjorie. Sorry. Go! Hide, hide, hide. Go. Go! Stay. Good morning. Thanks for meeting with me. - You've had vaccination? - No, I haven't. Please, take a seat. I'm not a fool, Mr. Menkoff. I know you're up to something. - Ms. Werne... - I don't understand it. I don't want to understand it. Whatever it is, it's highly irregular and unorthodox. Such things should be avoided. What is your point, Ms. Werne? Immunity. I want a guarantee that whatever it is that you are up to, I will not be dragged me down into it. I have a reputation to maintain... I'm sorry... I am part of the furniture here, Mr. Menkoff. I know people in very high places in this organisation. And I am known. I will be accommodated and I will be protected. And I will not be under-utilised. I'm sorry, this is about your work? Oh, you find this amusing, do you? No, is not amusing. Is, uh... Is waste. Waste is problem. Then we understand each other. Completely. Time to go, Ms. Werne. Max! Down! Shoot him! - Got him! - Not him, the other one! - There is other one? - The other one! Fucking idiot! Eh, Max? He's fucking idiot! I think I got him. - Ah! - Okay! Okay, Max, I think we did it. - Fucking hate this guy. - Eh? I had good line, he ruined my line. - What was line? - Ms. Werne, you're fired. Yeah, not so good line. Okay, uh, Ms. Werne, under-utilise this! Yes, is better. - Find dog. He knows too much. - Sure, Max. - I need drink. - Don't worry, Max. I will clean this up and I will find your little doggy. Here, doggy, doggy, doggy, doggy. Here, little doggy, doggy, doggy... Here, little doggy, doggy, doggy, doggy. Here, doggy, doggy, doggy, doggy... Here, doggy, doggy, doggy, doggy... - Guy Curry's office. - Yes. I'd like to talk to Mr. Curry. Can I say who's calling? - Uh, it's about a consultant. - Which consultant? Uh, Max Menkoff. Right, yes. Who's speaking? I really need to talk to Mr. Curry. I can take a message. - Or we could... meet? - Meet? Um... Tonight. I could meet you after work. You can trust me. You choose the venue. Somewhere safe. Okay? Okay. Uh, 114, Chapel Street. 7 PM. I'll carry a red handbag. See you then. Okay? Bye. Holy Toledo! Why don't you take a picture? Why don't you get into some lycra and we will? Go on, use your phone. Tweet it. - I use Instagram. - Oh. Pucks! Ha! Hai! Huh! I don't do lycra. Gotta be kidding me. Wait. Wait! I didn't know it was you on the phone. - Yeah, sure, whatever. - Please. Piss off. You're the one who wanted to talk to me. Yeah, well, I didn't know it was you at the time. I didn't know it was you either. This Menkoff, do you know him? What do you know? - Marjorie Werne. DPC Admin. - HR. She coordinates the data processing training program. - What about her? - She's dead. - What? - Deceased. They killed her and now she's totally dead. I hid and when I came out... I don't even know what they did with her body. - I want to talk to Mr. Curry. - I said you could trust me. This was a really weird place to meet. Do you know that? You said you wanted somewhere safe. Come on. Whatever it is they're putting in the water coolers seems to trigger them into droids. - Droids? - Yes. Gary doesn't talk to me anymore, he just... works. - You can't go back there. - I have to get my manga back. I can't start again. If they find out what you saw, they will kill you too. I need my manga. And someone has to feed Charlie. Charlie? Marjorie's dog. Well, be careful. Find out what you can. Ruby? Is it okay if I Facebook you? - Sure. Facebook. Whatever. - Great. - I'm gonna go now. - Okay. - Ruby. - Clive. I need... I can't speak to a bank staff while I'm under investigation. - I'm sorry. - Can I come in? - Absolutely not. - Clive, it's Curry. He's taken out bank-owned life insurance policies. He's named a consultant beneficiary. BOLI policy? Endobank? It's impossible. Harold would have no part in that. I've seen the policies. The consultant is a guy called Max Menkoff. He's been injecting the employees. They end up like robots. And Marjorie Werne is dead. - What? - There was a shooting. She was killed. You saw that? No. A guy at the DPC told me. - Right. Right. - You've got to help us. This is incredulous. All this in a matter of days? This place is probably under surveillance. Just go. 'All it takes for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing.' You taught me that. ♪ We pledge ourselves to Endobank ♪ We pledge ourselves to thee ♪ Colleagues one and all, we strive for productivity! ♪ Every hour of every day ♪ Every heart flies high ♪ As every moment we must think of our KPIs ♪ We pledge ourselves to Endobank ♪ We pledge ourselves to thee ♪ Colleagues one and all, we strive for productivity! Charlie. Charlie. Alright, now, very careful with your... Steady. Make sure... Make sure you don't drop anything. Wait for lift. Careful. Steady, steady. Wait, wait for lift. Ah, David. David Cork. Excuse me, excuse me. Please. Okay, everybody, in the lift. There we go. Down to four. You're into the lift. That is right. Hey! Come on, idiot. Get in there. Get in there. When you go into the foyer, do not come back. Keep going, do not come back. You are fired. Okay? You're fired. Goodbye! Goodbye. Pst! Tell me, what happens in the end? Must attain KPIs. No, no, no, I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about comic. Foxy Chaos. Right? Look, the last few pages. It's not finished. What happens? Listen to me, David Cork! Does she get away? Yes? Yes, I knew it! I knew it! Yes, you make me so happy. I knew it here. You're good man. Ah... Good. I wonder... Would you like to finish it for me? I would like to see ending. Must attain KPIs. Yes. Right. No, yes, no, you're right. Shit. Shit. I don't know what am I thinking. Okay. Okay. - He's here, Mr. Curry. - Good. Out. Max! - Drink? - No, thank you. Ah. So, how's it going? Implementation is very smooth. We will proceed with planning for full rollout. - Many logistical challenges. - I see. I see. Hm... - The Method is effective. - Yes, I can see that. It's... it's admirable. I'm not so sure we can go through with the full rollout, though. Why not? I have to consider my position, Max. It's risky. The Method is effective. The 4-7% rapid and permanent loss of cognitive function, we can maybe get away with that in the DPC but the whole bank... The error rate is acceptable. This is simply turnover. - This is not problem. - It's not personal, Max. It's business. You drove a hard bargain - the BOLI policies for your kids, your grandkids. You've provided. I just can't back a full rollout. - It's just prudent. - That is your final position? - I'm sorry. - Hm. So am I. Ah! Shh, it's only little needle. Fucker! You mad fucker! You know I've got the antidote... Your contract is terminated. You'll not use antidote. You'll keep antidote in safe, secure location. I will not use antidote. I will keep antidote in safe, secure location. At tomorrow's management meeting, you will recommend full rollout immediately. Yes, Mr. Menkoff. - Thirsty? - Yes, Mr. Menkoff. Keep antidote in safe, secure location. Good. Oh, uh, I'm sorry, uh... I was just leaving. - I am, uh, consultant. - Ah. Ready? Oh, shit. Hey. How's life? How much do you know about computers? Uh, the first computer dates back to the early 1940s when Konrad Zuse invented... - David. - Yes? Cease. I need to access some files of Curry's but how do I get in without a password? Uh, you'd need admin privileges. How do I do that? Can you get them? Can you? So, how's your day been? David? Okay, I can log in remotely and change the password. Great. - I'm in. - Be quick. Curry is at a short meeting. There's an antidote. We just need to find out where it is. Okay, the new password is 'Foxy'. - Holy mackerel. - What? Um, encrypted. The files. I can see 'em but I can't read them. Can you uncrypt them? - That's my workstation. - David? Vacate. David! I have instructions from Mr. Menkoff. What's happening? David, come on. We've got to hurry! - Amazing! - Nearly there. Hurry. Got it! Mr. Curry! How was the meeting? Water. Water. Water. Work. Work. Work. You... Yes? - Coffee? - Of course, Mr. Curry. Excellent idea. 'Cork. David Cork.' 'Marjorie Werne.' Wait. A little doggy. They make no sense. Some kind of codes, coordinates. What do you think? Shouldn't be too hard, right? I mean, you got through all that encryption. Surely, this is... Ruby, I don't know. Clive! - Go away! - You have to see these! I will not! I will stay here all night if I have to. Clive! For goodness' sake! All of the staff have been injected with a performance-enhancing drug. There's an... Leave now or I'll call the police. I saw Marjorie Werne killed. She was shot. By a window cleaner who was shooting at Mr. Menkoff. It was really weird but she had told me to call Head Office if... And I did. But we can't trust Mr. Curry. Please, Clive. Good Lord... Look. This sequence pertains to an underground vault complex at HQ. Where the antidote is stored. You're the only person in the world who can get to that. I'll have to get into the building first. Only way in is through the main foyer. There's no way not to be seen. I'm not supposed to be within 200m. You go in, you get it and you take it to David at the DPC. They'll recognize me. Not if you're dressed as a technician. Spare me. - Clive? - You can crash here tonight. - If it's easier. - How could I refuse? Do you snore? I'm 56 years old and... ..I've been drinking. You take the couch. And you, don't get any ideas. To Karpov's incredibly fat mother. And his stupid father. Oh. Karpov, did you find your little doggy? The little doggy, it is a spy. And the boy with the comic, he has not had vaccination. But I sent him with you. Yes, he went in to see the nurse. But now I think he is connected to Marjorie Werne. W-What? I-I sent you with him! He went into sick room but then you called me away. Remember, Max? Look. Look here. You see? The doctor, Dr. Mishi. Injections. And here is a little doggy. And here they are shooting and she runs away with the little doggy. I have discovered a spy! - Karpov. Karpov. - What? Ah! Max! Why you do this to me? - Fucking idiot! - Max. W-Why do you say Marjorie? Because of the register. The vaccination register. You believe he saw? Here, the dog, the dog biscuits. - Where? - In the storeroom. On the top floor, on Marjorie's floor. And what is this? Hmm... I do not know. Sorry. It's a bit of a mess. We'll fix it. Clive will get the antidote, we'll rescue the workers and they'll tell their story. - I meant the room. - Huh? The room, it's a bit of a mess. You know, your work... ..It's really good. Thanks. We should get some sleep. Big day tomorrow. Sure. Which side did you want to sleep on? Uh, don't care. I think I'd better take the Philby side. He might get a bit... freaked out if I didn't. Sure. How long have you been doing this? Since I was a kid. You should get a job illustrating. You're wasted at the DPC. You should see my new book. It's much better. I actually do my best work at the DPC. Well, I did until the Russian people arrived. Oh, shit. Jase? Sorry, no, I'm fine, I'm just... staying at a friend's. Yeah. Yep. See you tomorrow. Bye. - Ruby? Was that... - Jason? - Yeah. - Yeah. Very concerned for my wellbeing. I'm cool with that. - You met him. Briefly. - Sure. Do you have a brother? Brother? No. I'm lucky, I guess. Goodnight. Goodnight. Goodnight, Philby. You're fucked. Hm. - Black belt? - Third dan. Oh, shit. Water. Morning, Guy. Walk and talk? Just want to get the lowdown on this HR system rollout. Um, Menkoff? - Rollout. - Feeling better this morning? Rollout. Must order rollout. - Sure. Let's walk and talk. - Rollout. Gentlemen! - Maintenance - vaults. - What? You've got a Binkley 52 multi-locking system, right? It's due for routine maintenance. Overdue. - Do we? - You mean the empty one? I thought they checked that one last month. - I'll check the register. - Cancelled. Meant to be. Got cancelled. No, I'm sure they did it. Listen. It's a fuck-up. I had some woman troubles, if you know what I mean. You'd be doing me a big favor. I mean, we all know that Simon would be pissed off if he knew about it, right? That's for sure, yeah. It's Friday, right? So he's not on today. We get in, we get out, no-one's any wiser. Just a couple of minutes. If you want while I'm down there, I'll check the Felton 2000. I'll go with him. You right there? Um, on this third recommendation here, I'm concerned about the data that's going to perhaps be lost in... Um, and has this all been put into place already? Because I really don't think this follows normal protocol. Rollover. Must order... Guy? Guy? Yeah, I got me own woman troubles. I don't know what goes on.
