(birds chirp) (swing squeaks) (bicycle bell rings) - [Man] Morning. - [Women] Good morning. - [Woman] Father? - [Man] Morning, sir. - [Man] Good morning. (dog barks) - [Man] Ah ha! Don Pedro comes today to the (indistinct)! (people cheer) - He was not three miles off when I left him. - Have they lost many gentlemen in this battle? - But few, if any, saw of him. None of name. - I pray you, has Captain Mountanto returned from the wars or no? - [Man] I know none of that name lady. There was none such in the army of any source. - What is he that you ask for niece? - My cousin means Captain Benedict. (everyone exclaims) - Oh, Captain Benedict. He's returned and is pleasant as ever he was. - How many has he killed in these wars for indeed, I promised to eat all of his killings. - Bear his niece. - You tax Captain Benedict too much, but he'll be meet with you, I doubt it not. - Done good service in these wars. He's a good soldier too, lady. - And a good soldier to a lady. (women laugh) But what is he to a man? - [Man] A man? To a man? - Hey you must not sir mistake my niece as there is a kind of merry war betwixt Captain Benedict and her. They never meet, but there's a skirmish of wit between them. - In our last skirmish, four of his five wits went halting off. So now as the whole man governed with one. - I see lady, the gentlemen is not in your book. (everyone laughs) - No, and he were I would burn my study. Who is his companion now? He had every month, a new sworn brother. - He is most in the company of a right noble Claudio. - Oh, Lord. He will hang upon him like the plague. God help the noble Claudio if had have caught the Benedict. - I'll hold friends with you, lady. (bicycle bell rings) - Do. Good friend. - You will never catch the Benedict, niece. (laughs) - No, not till a hot January. (lively music) - [Claudio] Fall out! (crowd cheering) - [Man] Welcome home. - [Man] Welcome home, lad. (crowd chattering) (crowd cooing) - Good Leonato! (crowd cheering) Are you come to meet your trouble? The fashion of the world is to avoid cost and you encounter it. - Never came trouble to my house in the likeness of yourself. For indeed, trouble being gone, comfort should remain. But when you depart from me, sorrow abides and happiness takes his leave. (laughing) (clapping) - You embrace your charge too willingly. - [Photographer] Hold it! (crowd laughing) - I think this is your daughter. - Her mother has many times told me so. (laughing) - Were you in doubt, sir, that you asked her? - Captain Benedick! No sir, no, for then you were but a child. (laughing) - You have it full, Benedick. Truly, the lady fathers herself. Be happy, lady, for you are like an honorable father. - Free beer! (crowd cheering) - Lemonade! - If Signior Leonato be her father, she would not have his head on her shoulders for all the world, as like him as she is. - I wonder that you will still be talking, Captain Benedick, nobody marks you. - What, my dear Lady Disdain, are you yet living? - Is it possible disdain should die while she has such meet food to feed it as Captain Benedick? - It is certain I am loved of all ladies, only you excepted and I would I could find in my heart that I had not a hard heart, for truly, I love none. - A dear happiness to women, they else would have been troubled with a pernicious suitor. I thank God and my cold blood I am of your humor for that. I would rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man swear he loves me. - God keep your ladyship still in that mind, so some gentleman or other shall 'scape a predestinate scratched face. - Scratching would not make it worse, and 'twere such a face as yours were. (crowd mumbling) - Well, you are a rare parrot-teacher. - A bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours. - I would my horse had the speed of your tongue. But keep your way, in God's name, I have done. - You always end with a jade's trick. (laughing) I know you of old. (crowd chuckling) - Benedick! Claudio! My dear friend Leonato have invited you both. I tell him we shall stay here at least a month. He heartily prays some occasion may detain us longer. - Welcome, gentlemen. (woman gasping) I hope you'll come to my house also, sir. Being reconciled to your brother, I owe you all duty. - I thank you. I am not of many words, but I thank you. (mysterious music) - Well, please, you lead on? - Come, Leonato. We will go together. (upbeat music) - [Claudio] Benedick? Benedick! - [Benedick] Huh? - [Claudio] Didst thou note the daughter of Leonato? - [Benedick] I noted her not, but I looked on her. - Is she not a modest young lady? - Do you question me, as an honest man should do, for my simple true judgment? Or would you have me answer after my custom, as being a professed tyrant to their sex? - No, I pray you speak in sober judgment. - Why, i' faith, methinks she's too little for a great praise, too brown for a fair praise, and too low for a high praise. Only this commendation I can afford her. Were she other than she is, she were unhandsome, and being no other but as she is, I do not like her. - You think I am in sport. I pray you tell me truly how you like her. - Would you buy her, that you inquire after her? - Can the world buy such a jewel? - Yea, and a case to put it into. - In mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever I looked on. - Ha! I can see yet without spectacles and I see no such matter. There's her cousin, Beatrice, and she were not possessed of a fury, exceeds her as much in beauty as the first of May doth the last of December. But I hope you have no intent to turn husband, have you? - I would scarce trust myself, though I had sworn the contrary, if Hero would be my wife. - It's come to this? Shall I never see a bachelor of three-score again? Go to and thou would thrust thy neck into a yoke, wear the print of it and sigh away Sundays. Come, come on, out! - [Claudio] Benedick, Benedick. Come on, Benedick. (laughing) - What secret has held you here, that you follow not to Leonato's? - I would you would, sir, constrain me to tell. - I charge thee on thy allegiance. (chuckling) - Come on. (birds chirping) I can be secret as a dumb man. I would have you think so, but on my allegiance, mark you this, on my allegiance, he is in love. - Oh! - With who? Now mark how short his answer is. With Hero, Leonato's short daughter. - Amen, if you love her, for the lady is very well worthy. - Ah you speak this to fetch me in, sir. - By my troth, I speak my thought. - And in faith, sir, I spoke mine. - And by my two faiths and troths, sir, I spoke mine. - But I love her, I feel. - That she is worthy, I know. - That I neither feel how she should be loved nor know how she should be worthy is the opinion that fire will not melt out of me. I will die in it at the stake. - Well, you were ever an obstinate heretic in the despite of beauty. - And never could maintain his part but in the force of his will. (laughing) - That a woman conceived me, I thank her. That she brought me up, I likewise give her most humble thanks. But all women shall pardon me, because I will not do them the wrong to mistrust any, I will do myself the right to trust none and the fine is, for the which I may go the finer, I will live a bachelor. - Ah, I shall see thee, ere I die, look pale with love. - With anger, with hunger, or with sickness, sir, not with love. - In time the savage bull doth bear the yoke. - The savage bull may, but if ever the sensible Benedick bear it, pluck out the bull's horns and set them in my forehead, and let me be vilely painted and in such great letters as they write, here is good horse to hire. Let them signify under my sign, here you may see Benedick, the married man. (laughing) (gentle music) - [Claudio] Sir, you now may do me good. - My love is thine to teach, teach it but how, and thou shalt see how apt it is to learn any hard lesson that may do thee good. - Sir, hath Leonato any son? - No child but Hero. She's his only heir. Dost thou affect her, Claudio? - Sir, when you went onward on this ended battle, I looked upon her with a soldier's eye that liked, but had a rougher task in hand than to drive liking to the name of love. But now I am returned and that war thoughts have left their places vacant. In their rooms come thronging soft and delicate desires, all prompting me how fair young Hero is, saying I liked her ere I went to wars- - Thou wilt be like a lover presently and tire the hearer with a book of words. If thou dost love fair Hero, cherish it, and I will speak with her and with her father, and thou shalt have her. Was it not to this end that thou began'st to twist so fine a story? - How sweetly you do minister to love that know love's grief by his complexion, but lest my liking might too sudden seem, I would have salved it with a longer treatise. - Why should the bridge be broader than the flood? Look, what will serve is fit. 'Tis once, thou lovest. I will fit thee with the remedy. (gentle music) (birds chirping) I know, we will have reveling tonight. I will assume thy part in some disguise and tell fair Hero I am Claudio, and in her bosom I'll unclasp my heart and take her hearing prisoner with a force and strong encounter of my amorous tale. Then after with her father will I speak, and the conclusion is, she shall be thine. - Whoo! - Come, in practice let us put it presently. (dramatic music) - Brother! Brother! Brother, I can tell you strange news that you yet dreamt not of. - Are they good? - As the event stamps them. Don Pedro and Claudio, strolling by the lake were thus much overheard by a man of mine. Don Pedro, Claudio, Don Pedro discovered to Claudio that he loved my niece, your daughter, and meant to acknowledge it this night at the dance, and if he found her accordant, he meant to instantly tell you of it. - Hath the fellow any wit that told you this? - A good sharp fellow, I will send for him, and question him yourself. - No, no, we will hold it, but as a dream until the thing appear itself, but I will acquaint my daughter withal that she may be the better prepared for answer, Go you and tell her of it. Brother, have a care this busy time. (gentle music) (gun firing) (duck quacking) (gun firing) - [Conrade] Good-year, my lord. Why are you thus out of measure sad? - There's no measure in the occasion that breeds. Therefore, the sadness is without limit. (gun firing) - [Conrade] You should hear reason. - And when I've heard it, what blessing brings it? I cannot hide what I am. I must be sad when I have cause and smile at no man's jests, eat when I have stomach and tend on no man's business, sleep when I'm drowsy wait for no man's leisure, laugh when I am merry, and flatter no man's humors. - You have of late stood out against your brother, and he hath newly taken you into his grace. - I'd rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in his grace. And though I may not be said to be a flattering, honest man, it must not be denied, but I am a plain-dealing villain. (chuckling) Therefore, I have decreed not to sing in my cage. If I had my mouth, I'd bite. If I had my liberty, I would, do my liking. In the meantime, let me be as I am. Seek not to alter me. - Can you make no use of your discontent? - Uh-huh, I make all use of it, for I use it only. (footsteps thumping) Who comes here? Borachio! Oh, oh Borachio. - Ready? (laughing) - Borachio, what news? - I just came from a great supper. Your brother, Don Pedro, is royally entertained by Leonato, and I can give you intelligence of an intended marriage. - Will it serve as any model to build mischief on? What is he for a fool that betroths himself to unquietness? - Marry, it is your brother's right hand. - The most exquisite Claudio? - [Borachio] Even he. - He's a proper squire. Who? Who? Which way looks he? - Marry, one Hero, the daughter and heir to Leonato. - A very forward March-chick, eh! (laughing) Hey, how came you to this? - As I was hanging me a lantern, comes me Don Pedro and Claudio, together hand in hand in sad conference. I overheard it agreed upon that Don Pedro would woo Hero for himself, and having won her, give her to Claudio. - Come, come, let us thither. This may prove food to my displeasure. That young start-up, he hath all the glory of my overthrow. If I can cross him any way, I bless myself every way. You are both assure you will assist me? - [Both] To the death, my lord. - Come, let's to their great feast. Their cheer is the greater that I am subdued, eh? Well, I would the cook were of my mind. (laughing) (dramatic music) (lively music) - Brother! Was not Don John here at supper? - I saw him not. - Don John? How tartly that gentleman looks. I can never see him but I am heartburned an hour after. (laughing) - He were an excellent man that were made just in the midway between him and Captain Benedick. The one is too like an image and says nothing. The other too like the lady's eldest son, evermore tattling. - Niece, God will send you no husband if you be so shrewd of your tongue. - For the which blessing, I am at him upon my knees every morning and evening. Lord, I could not endure a husband with a beard upon his face. I'd rather lie in the woollen. (giggling) - You may light upon a husband that has no beard. - What should I do with him? Dress him in my apparel and make him my waiting gentlewoman? No, he that hath a beard is more than a youth and he that hath no beard is less than a man and he that is more than a youth is not for me and he that is less than a man, I am not for him. (laughing) - [Woman] Ah bravo! - Well, niece, I trust you will be ruled by your father. (Beatrice laughing) - Yes, faith. 'Tis my cousin's duty to make curtsy and say, Father, as it please you. - [Hero] Beatrice! - But yet, for all that, cousin, you let him be a handsome fellow, or else you make another curtsy and say, Father, as it please me. - Niece. I hope to see you one day fitted with a husband. - Not till God make men of some other metal than earth. (women giggling) Would it not grieve a woman to be overmastered with a piece of valiant dust? To make an account of her life to a clod of wayward mud? No, uncle, I'll none. Adam's sons are my brethren, and, truly, I hold it a sin to match in my kindred. (laughing) - Daughter, remember what I told you. If Don Pedro do solicit you in that kind, you know your answer. - The fault will be in the music, cousin, if you be not wooed in good time. If Don Pedro be too important, you tell him there is measure in everything and so dance out the answer. - You apprehend passing shrewdly, niece. - I have a good eye, uncle. I can see a church by daylight. (upbeat music) - Lady, will you walk about with your friend? - So you walk softly and look sweetly and say nothing, I am yours for the walk, and especially when I walk away. - With me in your company? - I may say so, when I please. (Don Pedro laughing) - And when please you to say so? - When I like your favor, God defend the lute should be like the case. - Speak low when you speak love. (Don Pedro growling) (upbeat music) - Well, I would you did like me. - So would not I, oh, for your own sake, for I have many ill qualities. - Which is one? - I say my prayers aloud. - I love you the better! The hearers may cry, amen. - God match me with a good dancer! - Amen. (upbeat music) - And God keep him from me when the dance is ended. (upbeat music) - I know you well enough, you are Antonio! - At a word, I am not. - Oh, I know you by the waggling of your head. - To tell you true, I counterfeit him. - Oh, you could never do him so ill-well unless you were the very man. (Ursula yelping) Oh, here's his dry hand up and down. You are he, who knew, you are he. - At a word, I am not. (laughing) - Oh, come, come, do you think I do not know you by your excellent wit? Can virtue hide itself? Go to, mum, you are he. Graces will appear and there's an end. (jaunty music) - And will you not tell me who told you so? - No, you shall pardon me. - Nor will you tell me who you are? - Not now. - If I was disdainful and had my good wit out of "A Hundred Merry Tales," well that was Captain Benedick that said so. - What is he? (gentle instrumental music) - I'm sure you know him well enough. - Not I, believe me. - Did he never make you laugh? - I pray you, what is he? - Why, he is Don Pedro's jester, a very dull fool. Only his gift is in devising impossible slanders. None but the libertines delight in him. And the commendation is not in his wit, but his villainy, for he both pleases men and angers them. Then they laugh at him and beat him. I'm sure he is at the dance. I would he had danced with me. - When I know the gentleman, I will tell him what you say. - Do. Do. He'll but break a comparison or two on me, which peradventure not marked nor not laughed at, strikes him into melancholy and then there's a partridge wing saved, for the fool will eat no supper that evening. (upbeat music) We must follow the leaders. - In every good thing. (lively music) (clock chiming) - Benedick? Are not you Captain Benedick? - You know me well. I am he. - Benedick, Benedick, you are very near my brother in his love. He is truly in love with Hero. (Claudio coughing) I pray you, dissuade him from her. She's no equal to his birth. - How know you he loves her? - I heard him swear his affection. - So did I too, and he swore he would marry her tonight. - Tonight? - Tonight. - Tonight. Come, let's to the banquet. (gentle music) - Thus answer I in name of Benedick, but hear these ill news with the ears of Claudio. 'Tis certain, so Don Pedro woos for himself. Friendship is constant in all other things save in the office and affairs of love. Therefore, all hearts in love, use your own tongues. Let every eye negotiate for itself and trust no agent, for beauty is a witch against whose charms faith melteth into blood. This is an accident of hourly proof, which I mistrusted not. Farewell, therefore, Hero. (door knocking) - [Benedick] Claudio? - Yea, the same. - Come, will you go with me? - [Claudio] Whither? - Even to the next willow about your own business, for Don Pedro has got your Hero. - I wish him joy of her. - Why, that's spoken like an honest gentleman, but did you think Don Pedro would have used you thus? - I pray you, leave me! - Hey, now you strike like the blind man. It's the boy who stole your meat, and you'll beat the post. - If it will not be, I'll leave you. (door slamming) - Alas, poor hurt fowl, but that my Lady Beatrice should know me and not know me. Don Pedro's jester, ha! It may be I go by that title because I am merry. Yea, but so I am apt to do myself wrong. I am not so reputed. It is the base, though bitter, disposition of Beatrice that puts the world into her person and so gives me out. Well, I'll be revenged as I may. - [Don Pedro] Benedick, where's Claudio? Did you see him? - Troth, sir, I've played the part of Lady Fame. I told him and I think I told him true, that you had got the good will of his young lady, and I offered him my company to a willow tree. - Oh, a willow tree. - He was as melancholy as a schoolboy, who, being overjoyed at finding a bird's nest, shows it his companion and he steals it, (Don Pedro laughing) and you, as I take it, have stolen his bird's nest. - I will but teach them to sing and restore them to their owners. - [Benedick] Oh. - The Lady Beatrice has a quarrel to you. The gentleman that danced with her told her she is much wronged by you. - Oh, she misused me past the endurance of a block. (Don Pedro laughing) An oak, but with one green leaf on it would have answered her. My very visor began to assume life and scolded her. She told me, not thinking I had been myself, that I was your jester, that I was duller than a great thaw, huddling jest upon jest with such impossible conveyance upon me that I stood like a man at a mark with a whole army shooting at me. (Don Pedro laughing) She speaks poniards. Every word stabs. If her breath were as terrible as her terminations, there were no living near her. She would infect to the North Star. (Don Pedro laughing) I would not marry her, though she were endowed with everything that Adam had left him before he transgressed. Come, talk not of her. I would to God some scholar would conjure her, for sure, while she is here, a man may live as quiet in hell, and people sin upon purpose, because they would go thither. (Don Pedro laughing) So, indeed, all disquiet, horror and perturbation follows her. - Look, where she comes! (laughing) - Will you command me any service now to the world's end? I will go on the slightest errand now to the Antipodes that you can devise to send me on. I will fetch you a tooth picker now from the furthest inch of Asia, bring you the length of Prester John's foot, fetch you a hair off the great Cham's beard. Do you any embassage to the Pigmies, rather than hold three words' conference with this harpy? You have no employment for me? - None, except to desire your good company. - Oh God, sir, here's a dish I love not. I cannot endure my Lady Tongue. (laughing) - Come, lady, come. You have lost the heart of Captain Benedick. - Indeed, good sir, he lent it me awhile, and I gave him use for it, a double heart for his single one. Marry, once before he won it of me with false dice, so you may well say I have lost it. - You have put him down, lady. You have put him down. - So I would not he should do me, my lord, lest I should prove the mother of fools. (laughing) I brought Claudio, whom you sent me to seek. - Well, how now, Claudio? Wherefore are you sad? - Not sad, sir. - How then, sick? - Neither, sir. - He is neither sad, nor sick, nor well, nor merry, but civil Claudio, civil as a new orange, and something of that jealous complexion. - In faith, lady, I think that your story be true, though I'll be sworn if he be so, his belief is false. (clock chiming) Come, Claudio, I have wooed in thy name and the fair Hero is won. I have spoke with her father and his good will obtained. Name the day of marriage and God give thee joy. - Sir, take of me my daughter and with her my fortunes. His grace hath made the match, and all grace say amen to it. - Amen. - Speak, Claudio! 'Tis your cue. (laughing) - Silence is the perfectest herald of joy. I were but little happy, if I could say how much. Lady, as you are mine, I am yours. I give away myself for you and dote upon the exchange. - Speak, cousin, or, if you cannot, stop his mouth with a kiss and let not him speak neither. (laughing) - In faith, lady, you have a merry heart. - Yea, my lord, I thank it. Poor fool, it keeps on the windy side of care. Oh, my cousin tells him in his ear that he is in her heart. - And so she doth, cousin. (laughing) - Good Lord, for alliance! Thus goes every one to the world, but I, and I am sunburnt. I may sit in a corner and cry heigh-ho for a husband. - Lady Beatrice, I will get you one. - I would rather have one of your father's getting. Hath your grace ne'er a brother like you? Your father got excellent husbands, if a maid could come by them. - Will you have me, lady? - No, my lord, unless I might have another for working days. Your grace is too costly to wear every day. (Don Pedro coughing) But I beseech you, pardon me, I was born to speak all mirth and no matter. - Your silence most offends me, and to be merry best becomes you, for out of question, you were born at a merry hour. - No, sure my lord, my mother cried, but then there was a star danced and under that was I born. Cousins, God give you joy. - [Leonato] Will you look to those things I told you of, niece? - I cry you mercy, uncle. Kind sir, by your pardon. - By my troth, a pleasant spirited lady. - There's very little of the melancholy element in her, sir. Indeed, she's never sad but when she sleeps, and not ever sad then, for my daughter hath told me, she has many times dreamed of unhappiness and waked herself with laughing. (laughing) - She uh, she cannot endure to hear tell of a husband. - No, no, she mocks all her lovers out of suit. - She were an excellent wife for Benedick. - Oh, Lord, were they but a week married, they would talk themselves mad. - Claudio, when mean you to go to church? - Tomorrow, sir, time goes on crutches till love have all his rites. - Ah, not till Monday, my dear son, wseven-night and time too brief too, to have all things answer my mind. - Come, Claudio, you shake the head at so long a waiting. I warrant you the time will not go dully by, for in the interim, I will undertake one of Hercules' labors, which is to bring the Lady Beatrice and Captain Benedick into a mount of affection, the one for the other. I would fain have it a match. And I doubt not but to fashion it, if you three will but render such assistance as I shall give you direction. - [Leonato] Oh I am for you, it cost me 10 nights' watching. - [Claudio] And I, sir. - And you too, gentle Hero? - I will do any modest office, my lord, to help my cousin to a good husband. - And Benedick is not the unhopefullest husband that I know of. Thus far can I praise him; he is of a noble strain, of approved valor, of confirmed honesty. I will teach you how to humor your cousin, so she will fall in love with Benedick, and I, with your two helps, will so practice on Benedick, that despite his queasy stomach and his quick wit, he will fall in love with Beatrice. (gentle music) If we can do this, Cupid's glory will be ours, for we are the only love gods. (dramatic music) - It is! Is is so that goddamned Claudio will marry the daughter of Leonato! He will marry her! It is, it is, it is so! He will marry and there is- (chaotic piano music) - Yea, my lord, yea, yea, yea, but I can cross it. - Any cross, any impediment is medicinable to me! I am sick in displeasure to him. How canst thou cross this marriage? - Not honestly, my lord, but so covertly that no dishonesty shall appear in me. - Show me briefly how. - I think I told you a year ago how much I am in the favor of Margaret, the waiting gentlewoman to Lady Hero. - [Don John] I remember. - I can, at any unseasonable instant of the night, appoint her to look out at her lady's chamber window. - What life is in that to be the death of this marriage? - The poison of that lies in you to temper. - Huh? - Go you to your brother. Spare not to tell him that he hath wronged his honor in marrying the renowned Claudio to a contaminated stale, such a one as Hero. - Oh. (laughing) - Go and find me a meet hour to draw Don Pedro and Claudio together alone. - Yeah. - They will scarce believe it without a trial. - Offer them instances, which shall bear no less likelihood than to see me at Lady Hero's chamber window, hear me call Margaret, Hero, hear Margaret term me, lover. And bring them to see this the very night before the intended wedding, for in the meantime, I will so fashion the matter that Hero shall be absent, and this shall be proof enough to misuse Don Pedro and to vex Claudio, to undo Hero and kill Leonato. (laughing) Look you for any other issue. - Only to despite them I would endeavor anything. Now you, you be cunning in the working of this, and thy fee is 1000 silver coins. (laughing) I will presently go learn their day of marriage. (somber piano music) (upbeat piano music) (sentimental music) (lively music) - I do much wonder that one man, seeing how much another man is a fool when he dedicates his behaviors to love, will after he hath laughed at such shallow follies in others become the argument of his own scorn by falling in love and such a man is Claudio. I have known when there was no music with him but the drum and the fife, and now would he rather hear the oboe and the flute. He was wont to speak plain and to the purpose, like an honest man and a soldier. And now is he turned orthography. His words are a very fantastical banquet, just so many strange dishes. (birds chirping) May I be so converted and see with these eyes? I cannot tell. I think not. I will not be sworn, but love may transform me to an oyster, but I'll take my oath on it. Till love hath made an oyster of me, he shall never make me such a fool. One woman is fair, yet I am well. Another is wise, yet I am well. Another virtuous, yet I am well. But till all graces be in one woman, one woman shall not come into my grace. Rich she shall be, that's certain. Wise, or I'll none. Virtuous, or I'll never cheapen her. Fair, or I'll never look on her. Of good discourse, an excellent musician and her hair, shall be of what color it please God. - [Don Pedro] What ho, Claudio? (laughing) - Don Pedro and Monsieur Love. I will hide me. (bird cawing) - Come, shall we hear this music? - Yea, how still the water is, as hushed on purpose to grace harmony. - See you where Benedick hath hid himself? - Very well, sir. - Come, Balthasar, we'll hear that song again. - Oh, good my lord, tax not so bad a voice to slander music any more than once. - I pray thee, sing, and let me woo no more. - Because you talk of wooing, I will sing. Note this before my notes. There's not a note of mine that's worth the noting. (gentle music) - Now, divine air, now is his soul ravished. - [Balthasar] One, two, three, four. ♪ Sigh no more, ladies ♪ Sigh no more ♪ Men were deceivers ever ♪ One foot in sea and one on the shore ♪ ♪ To one thing constant never ♪ Then sigh not so ♪ But let them go ♪ And be you blithe and bonny ♪ Converting all your songs of woe ♪ ♪ Into, hey, nonny, nonny, nonny ♪ ♪ Hey, nonny, nonny, nonny, nonny ♪ - [Balthasar] One, two, three, four. ♪ Sing no more ditties ♪ Sing no more ♪ No song so dull and heavy ♪ The fraud of men was ever so ♪ Since summer first was levity ♪ ♪ Then sigh not so ♪ But let them go ♪ And be blithe and bonny ♪ Converting all your songs of woe ♪ ♪ Into, hey, nonny, nonny, nonny ♪ ♪ Hey, nonny, nonny, nonny, nonny ♪ - Once more! ♪ Into, hey, nonny, nonny, nonny ♪ ♪ Hey, nonny, nonny, nonny, nonny ♪ (laughing) - [Pedro] By my troth, a good song. - And an ill singer, my lord. - No, no, faith, thou singest well enough for a shift. - And he had been a dog that would have howled thus, they would have hanged him, and I pray God his bad voice bode no mischief. - Yea, marry, dost thou hear, Balthasar? I pray thee, get us some excellent music, for we would have it tomorrow evening at the Lady Hero's chamber window. - The best I can, my lord. - Do so, farewell. - [Balthasar] Farewell! - Farewell. Um, come hither, Leonato. What was it you told me of today? Oh, that your niece Beatrice is in love with Captain Benedick? - [Claudio] I did never think that lady would have loved any man. - Nor I, but most wonderful that she should so dote on Captain Benedick, whom she has seemed to all outward behavior ever to abhor. (birds chirping) - Is it possible? Sits the wind in that corner? - By my troth, I know not what to think of it, but that she loves him with an enraged affection. It is past the infinite of thought. - Why, what effects of passion shows she? - Bait the hook well. This fish will bite. - [Leonato] Uh, oh uh, you heard my daughter tell you how. - How, how, I pray you? (laughing) Shh! You amaze me. I would have thought her spirits were proof against all assaults of affection. - I would have sworn they were, especially against Benedick. - Hath she made her affection known to Benedick? - No, no, and swears she never will. That's her torment. - 'Tis true, indeed, so your daughter says, "Shall I," says she, "that have so oft encountered him "with scorn write to him that I love him?" - And yet she'll be up 20 times a night, sitting in her smock till she have writ a sheet of paper. - Then down upon her knees she falls, weeps, sobs, beats her heart, tears her hair, prays, curses, "Oh, sweet Benedick, God give me patience." - Oh, she doth indeed and my daughter says so, and the ecstasy has so much overborne her that my daughter is sometimes afeared that she will do some desperate outrage unto herself. - [Claudio] Oh! - [Don Pedro] No! - [Leonato] 'Tis very true. - It were good that Benedick knew of it by some other, if she will not discover it. - [Claudio] Ah to what end? He would make but a sport of it and torment the poor lady worse. - And he should, it were alms to hang him. She's an excellent, sweet lady and out of all suspicion, she is virtuous. - [Claudio] And she is exceeding wise. - In every thing, except in loving Benedick. I would she had bestowed this dotage on me. I would have daffed all other respects and made her half myself. (faint birds crying) I pray you, tell Benedick of her love and see what he will say. - Were it good, think you? - Hero thinks surely she will die, for she says she will die if he love her not, and she will die ere she make her love known, and she will die if he woo her, rather than she will bate one breath of her accustomed crossness. - She doth well. If she should make tender of her love, it is very possible that he will scorn it, for the man, as you all know, hath a contemptible spirit. - He's, he's a very proper man. - Oh, he hath indeed a good outward happiness. - [Claudio] Before God and in my mind, very wise. - Oh, he hath some sparks that are like wit. Well, I am sorry for your niece. Shall we go seek Benedick and tell him of her love? - No, never tell him, sir. Let her wear it out with good counsel. - No, no, that's impossible. She may wear her heart out first. - Well, we will hear further of it by your daughter. Let it cool the while. I love Benedick well, and I could wish he would modestly examine himself how much unworthy he is so good a lady. - [Leonato] Sir, will you walk? Supper is ready. (gentle music) - If he do not dote on her upon this, I will never trust my expectation. - Let the same net be spread for her. That must your daughter and her gentlewomen carry. The sport will be when they each hold an opinion of the other's dotage and no such matter. That is the scene I would see. Let us send her to call him in to dinner. (laughing) (gentle music) - This can be no trick. The conference was sadly borne. They have the truth of it from Hero. They seem to pity the lady. It seems her affections have their full bent. Love me! (gentle music) Why, it must be requited. I hear how I am censured. They say I will bear myself proudly, if I perceive the love come from her. They say too that she would rather die than give any sign of affection. (birds chirping) I did never think to marry. I must not seem proud. Happy are they that hear their detractions and can put them to mending. They say the lady is fair. 'Tis a truth, I can bear them witness. And virtuous, 'tis so, I cannot reprove it. And wise, but for loving me. By my faith, it is no addition to her wit, nor no great argument of her folly, for I will be horribly in love with her. I may chance have some odd quirks and remnants of wit broken upon me, because I have railed so long against marriage, but doth not the appetite alter? A man loves the meat in his youth he cannot endure in his age. Shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of the brain awe a man from the career of his humor? No, the world must be peopled. When I said that I would die a bachelor, I never thought that I should live till I were married. (gentle music) Here comes Beatrice. By this day, she's a fair lady. I do spy some marks of love about her. - Against my will, I am sent to bid you come in to dinner. - Fair Beatrice, I thank you for your pains. - I took no more pains for those thanks, than you take pains to thank me. If it had been painful, I would not have come. - You take pleasure then in the message? - Yea, Captain, just so much as you may take upon a knife's point and choke a daw withal. You have no stomach, Captain? Fare you well. - Ha! "Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner." There's a double meaning in that. "I took no more pains for those thanks "than you took pains to thank me." That's as much as to say, any pains that I take for you is as easy as thanks. (gentle music) If I do not take pity of her, I am a villain. If I do not love her, I am a, I will go get her picture. (sentimental music) - Good Margaret, (laughing) good Margaret! Good Margaret, run thee to the parlor. There shalt thou find my cousin Beatrice proposing with Don Pedro and Claudio. Whisper her ear and tell her I and Ursula walk in the orchard and our whole discourse is all of her. (laughing) Say that thou overheard'st us and bid her sneak into the pleached garden where honeysuckles, ripened by the sun, forbid the sun to enter, like favorites made proud by princes that advance their pride against that power that bred it. There will she hide her and listen our propose. This is thy office. Bear thee well in it and leave us alone. (laughing) - Now, now, Ursula! Ursula, as we do trace this alley up and down, our talk must only be of Benedick. When I do mention him, let be thy part to praise him more than ever man did merit. My talk to thee must be of how Benedick is sick in love with Beatrice. (laughing) Of this matter is little Cupid's crafty arrow made that only wounds by hearsay. Oh, now begin! For look where Beatrice, like a lapwing, runs to hear our conference. - Fear you not my part of the dialogue. - Then let her ear lose none of the false sweet bait we lay for it. (birds chirping) No, no, no, truly, Ursula, she is too disdainful! I know, her spirits are as coy and wild as haggards of the rock. - [Ursula] But are you sure that Benedick loves Beatrice so entirely? (plant thudding) (giggling) - So says Don Pedro and my newly-trothed lord. - And did they bid you tell her of it, madam? - Oh, they did entreat me to acquaint her of it, but I persuaded them, if they love Benedick, to wish him wrestle with affection and never to let Beatrice know of it. - Why did you so? Doth not the gentleman deserve as full as fortunate a bed as ever Beatrice shall couch upon? - Oh, god of love, I know he doth deserve as much as may be yielded to a man, but nature never framed a woman's heart of prouder stuff than that of Beatrice. Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes, misprising what they look on. And her wit values itself so highly that to her all matter else seems weak. No, she cannot love, nor take no shape nor project of affection, she is so self-endeared. - Sure, I think so. Therefore, certainly it were not good she knew his love, lest she'll make sport at it. - Why, you speak truth. I never yet saw man how wise, how noble, young, how rarely featured, but she would spell him backwards. She turns every man the wrong side out. - Sure, sure, such carping is not commendable. - No, not to be so odd and from all fashion as Beatrice is cannot be commendable, but who dare tell her so? If I should speak, she would mock me into air. Oh, she would laugh me out of myself, press me to death with wit. Therefore, let Benedick, like covered fire, consume away in sighs, waste inwardly. It were a better death than die with mocks, which is as bad as die with tickling. - Yet tell her of it. Hear what she will say! - No, rather I will go to Benedick and counsel him to fight against his passion, and truly, I'll devise some honest slanders to stain my cousin with. One doth not know how much an ill word may empoison liking. - Oh, do not do your cousin such a wrong! She cannot be so much without true judgment, having so swift and excellent a wit as she is prized to have, as to refuse so rare a gentleman as Captain Benedick. - [Hero] He is the only man. Always excepted my dear Claudio. - But Benedick, for shape, for bearing, argument and valor, goes foremost in report throughout the land. - He hath an excellent good name. - His excellence did earn it, ere he had it. (metal creaking) (water pattering) ♪ Though the heart be weary ♪ Sad the day and the long ♪ Still to us at twilight ♪ Comes love's old song ♪ Comes love's old sweet song When are you married, madam? - Why, every day, tomorrow. (laughing) Come, go in. I'll show thee some attires and have thy counsel which is the best to furnish me tomorrow. - She is limed, I warrant you. We have caught her, madam. - If it proves so, then loving goes by haps. Some Cupid kills with arrows, some with traps. (gentle music) - What fire is in mine ears? Can this be true? Stand I condemned for pride and scorn so much? Contempt, farewell! And maiden pride, adieu! No glory lives behind the back of such, and Benedick, love on! I will requite thee, taming my wild heart to thy loving hand. If thou dost love, my kindness shall incite thee to bind our loves up in a holy band. For others say thou dost deserve and I believe it better than reportingly. (sneezing) (laughing) (faint children yelling) (dog barking) (faint children yelling) - I do but stay till your marriage be consummate. - [Woman] Good day, gentlemen. - [Don Pedro] Hello. - [Woman] Hello, sir. - Then I go north. - I'll bring you thither, sir, if you'll let me. - Nay. (laughing) I will only be bold with Benedick for his company. (bell tinkling) From the crown of his head to the sole of his feet, Benedick is all mirth. (laughing) - Gallants, I am not as I have been. - [All] Aw. - So say I. I think you are sadder. - I hope he be in love. - Hang him, truant. There's no true drop of blood in him to be truly touched with love. No, if he be sad, he lacks money. - [Claudio] If he be mad in love with some woman, there's no believing old signs. He brushes his hat in the morning. Now what should that bode? - Indeed, he looks younger than he did by the loss of a beard. (laughing) - And he rubs himself with civet. Can you smell him out by that? - [Claudio] That's as much as to say the sweet youth's in love. - And the greatest note of it is his melancholy. - [Claudio] And when was he wont to wash his face? - What? Conclude, conclude he is in love. - [Claudio] Nay, but I know who loves him. - That would I know too. I warrant you, one that knows him not. - Well, every man can master a grief, but he that has it. (laughing) Good Leonato, walk aside with me. I have studied eight or nine wise words to speak to you, which these hobby horses must not hear. (laughing) (bell tinkling) - On my life, to speak with him about Beatrice. - 'Tis even so. Hero and Margaret have by this played their part with Beatrice. Then the two bears will not bite one another when they meet. - Brother, (bell tinkling) God save you. - Good day, brother. - In private? - If it please you, yet Claudio might hear, for what I would speak of concerns him. (bell tinkling) (bell tinkling) - What's the matter? - Mean you to be married tomorrow, sir? - You know he does. - I know not that, when he knows what I know. - If there be any impediment, I pray you discover it. - Sir, you may think I love you not. Let that appear hereafter, and aim better at me by that which I now will manifest. ♪ Nee, nee, na nee, nee - What's the matter? - Well, I came hither to tell you and circumstances shortened, for she's been too long a ty is disloyal. - God. - Who, Hero? - Even she. Leonato's Hero, your Hero, every man's Hero. - Disloyal? - The word is too good to paint out her wickedness. I could say she were worse. Think you of a worse title, I'll fit her to it. Wonder not till further warrant. Go but with me tonight and you will see her chamber window entered, even the night before her wedding day. If you love her then, well, tomorrow wed her, though it would better fit your honor to change your mind. - May this be so? - I will not think it. - If you dare not trust that you see, then confess not that you know. If you will follow me, I'll show you enough and when you have seen more and heard more, proceed accordingly. - If I see anything tonight why I should not marry her tomorrow, in the congregation where I should wed, there will I shame her! - And as I wooed for thee to obtain her, so will I join with thee to disgrace her. - I will disparage her no farther till you are my witnesses. Bear it coldly but till midnight and let the issue show itself. - Oh day untowardly turned. (bell tinkling) - And a mischief strangely thwarting. (bell tinkling) - Oh plague right well prevented, (mysterious music) so will you say (bell tinkling) when you have seen the sequel. (dramatic music) (jaunty music) (car horn blaring) (jaunty music) (horn honking) (jaunty music) (bell clanging) (jaunty music) (dog barking) (jaunty music) (whistle shrieking) (energetic music) (whistle shrieking) - Are you good men and true? - Yea, or else it were pity but they should suffer salvation, body and soul. - First, who think you the most desertless man to be constable? - Hugh Otecake, Neighbor Dogberry, or George Seacole, for they can both write and read. - Come hither, Neighbor Seacole. It is thought here that you are the most senseless and fit man to be constable of the watch. Therefore bear you the lantern. (clapping) This is your charge. You are to comprehend all vagrom men and bid them stand in the name of the law. - How if he will not stand? - Well then, take no note of him, but let him go, and presently call the rest of the watch together and thank God you are rid of a knave. - They will not stand in the name of the law, he is none of the governor's subjects. - True and they are to meddle with none but the governor's subjects. You are to make no noise in the streets, for, for the watch to babble and to talk is most tolerable, not to be endured. - We will rather sleep than talk. We know what belongs to a watch. (chuckling) - Why, you speak like a most ancient and quiet watchman, for I cannot see how sleeping could offend. Only have a care that your bills be not stolen. - Ale houses. Ale houses. - You're to call at all the ale houses and bid those that are drunk get them to bed. - How if they will not? - Well, then, leave them alone till they're sober. If they make you not then the better answer, you may say that they are not the men you took them for. - [Constable] Well, sir. - Thief. - If you do meet a thief, you may suspect him, by virtue of your office, to be no true man. And for such kind of men, why, the less you meddle or mix with them, why, the more is for your honesty. - But if we know a man to be a thief, sir, shall we not lay hands on him? - Well, truly, by your office, you may, but I think they that touch pitch will be defiled. Therefore, the most peaceable way, if you do meet a thief, is to let him show himself for what he is and steal out of your company, eh? - [Constable] Oh. (laughing) - You have been always called a merciful man, partner. If you hear a child cry in the night, you must call to the nurse and bid her still it. - How if the nurse be asleep and will not hear us? - Well, then, depart in peace, and let the child wake her with crying. Well, masters, that's the end of your charge. You, constable, are to present the governor's own person. Well, masters, good night. Anything of weight chances, call up me. Keep your fellows' counsel and your own and good night. Come, neighbor. (car engine puttering) One other thing, honest neighbors. Keep a watch around Leonato's house tonight, for the wedding being there tomorrow, there is great confusion there tonight. Adieu. Be vigitant, I beseech you. (jaunty music) (car backfiring) (horn honking) (jaunty music) (whistle blowing) (jaunty music) - [Borachio] Conrade! Conrade! - Stir not. (jaunty music) - Conrade! (jaunty music) - Here, man, I am at your elbow. Forward with your tale. - Stand thee close, and I will, like a true drunkard, tell thee all. - Some treason, Neighbor Otecake, stand close! - Therefore know that I have earned of Don John a thousand silver coin. - I know that villain! He's been a vile thief this seven years. He goes up and down like a gentleman. - Didst thou not hear somebody? - No. (insects chirping) 'Twas the vane on the courthouse. (laughing) - Know that I have wooed Margaret, the waiting gentlewoman to the Lady Hero, by the name of Hero. (laughing) - Shh, shh, shh. Shh. bids me a thousand times good night, oh, good night. I tell this tale vilely. I should first tell thee how Don John, Don Pedro and Claudio, planted, placed and possessed by my master Don John, saw afar off in the orchard this amiable encounter. - [Conrade] And thought they Margaret was Hero? - Two of them did, but the devil my master knew she was Margaret and partly by his oaths, which first possessed them, but chiefly by my villainy, away went Claudio enraged, swore he would meet her next morning as was appointed at the temple, and there, before the whole congregation, shame her with what he saw o'er night and send her home again without a husband. (laughing) (whistle shrieking) (bell ringing) (jaunty music) (insects chirping) (jaunty music) (loud crashing) (chaotic music) (dramatic music) (whistle shrieking) (dog barking) (birds chirping) (Hero groaning) - Good Ursula, wake my cousin Beatrice and desire her to rise. - [Ursula] I will, lady. - And bid her come hither. - Well. (Hero crying) (faint children chattering) - Troth, I think your other petticoat were better. - No, pray thee, good Meg, I'll wear this. - No, by my troth, it's not so good. I warrant your cousin will say so. - Oh, my cousin's a fool and thou art another. I'll wear none but this. - I like the new veil excellently, if your hair were a thought lighter, and your gown's a most rare fashion, (mumbles) faith. I saw the Duchess of Moliver's gown they praise so. - [Hero] Oh, that exceeds, they say. - Oh, it's but a nightgown in respect of yours. For a fine, quaint, graceful and elegant fashion, yours is worth 10 on't. - God give me joy to wear it, for my heart is exceeding heavy. - 'Twill be heavier soon by the weight of a man. (laughing) - Fie on thee. Art not ashamed? - Of what, lady? Of speaking honorably? Is not marriage honorable in a beggar? Oh, I think you would have me say, saving your reverence, a husband, Well, I'll offend nobody. Is there any harm in the heavier for a husband? None I think, and it be the right husband and the right wife. Otherwise 'tis light and not heavy. (laughing) (Beatrice sneezing) We'll ask my Lady Beatrice else. Here she comes. - [Hero] Good morrow, cous. - [Beatrice] Oh, good morrow, sweet Hero. - Why how now do you speak in the sick tune? - Oh, I'm out of all other tune, methinks. - Collapse into light of love. (laughing) That goes without a burden. Do you sing it, I'll dance it. La da dum (spitting) la la! - Ye light of love, with your heels. 'Tis almost five o'clock, cousin. 'Tis time you were ready. Oh, by my troth, I am exceeding ill, heigh ho. - For a hawk, a horse, or a husband? - What means the fool? - Nothing I, but God send every one their heart's desire. - Oh, these gloves Claudio sent me, they are an excellent perfume. - I am stuffed, cousin, I cannot smell. - A maid and stuffed, there's goodly catching of cold. - God help me. - Ever since you left it. Doth not my wit become me rarely? - It is not seen enough. You should wear it in your cap. Oh, by my troth, I am sick. - Get you some of this distilled Carduus Benedictus. Lay it to your heart. It's the only thing for a qualm. (birds chirping) - Benedictus. Why Benedictus? You have some moral in this Benedictus. - Moral, no, by my troth, I have no moral meaning. I meant plain holy thistle. Oh, you may think perchance that I think you're in love. Nay, by'r lady, I'm not such a fool to think what I choose, nor I choose not to think what I can, nor I cannot think that you are in love, or that you will be in love, or that you can be in love. Yet Benedick was such another and now is he become a man. He swore he would never marry, and yet now, in despite his heart, he eats his meat without grudging. How you may be converted I know not, yet methinks you look with your eyes as other women do. - What pace is this that thy tongue keeps? - Not a false gallop. (yelling) (laughing) - Madam, withdraw. Don Pedro, Claudio, Benedick, Don John, and all the gallants of the town are come to fetch you to church. (gentle music) - Help to dress me, good Ursula, good Mag, good cous. (laughing) (gentle music) (clock ticking) (clock chiming) - What would you with me, honest neighbors? - Marry, sir, I would have some confidence with you that discerns you nearly. - Be brief, I pray you, for you see it is a busy time with me. - Marry, this it is, sir. I, uh- - [Verges] Yes, indeed it is, sir. - What is it, honest neighbors? - Goodman Verges, sir, speaks a little off the subject, sir. A good man, sir, but his brains are not so blunt as, God help, I would desire they were, but honest to faith as the skin between his brows. - Yes, I thank God I am as honest as any man living that is a man and no honester than I. - Comparisons are odorous, palabras, Neighbor Verges. - Neighbors, you are tedious. - Ah, it pleases your worship to say so. For mine own part, even though I were as tedious as a king, I would find it in my heart to bestow it all on your worship. - All thy tediousness on me? - Aye, even though 'twere 1000 times more than it is, for I hear as good exclamation on your worship as any man in the city and though I be but a poor man, I am glad to hear it. - And so am I. - Marry, sir, our watch this evening hath taken a couple, excepting your worship's presence, as arrant knaves as any in the county. - A good man, sir, he will be talking. As they say, when the ale is in, the wit is out. Well, God's a good man. Two men ride of a horse, one must ride behind. Alas, poor neighbor, well, gifts that God gives. - I must leave you now. - A word, sir, the watch have indeed comprehended two auspicious persons and we would desire them this morning to be examined before your worship. - Take their examination yourself and bring it me. I am now in very great haste, as may appear to you. - It shall be suffigance. - Good, here, drink some wine ere you go. - Brother, they stay for you to give your daughter to her husband. - I'll wait upon them, I'm ready. - Go, good partner. Fetch Francis Seacole. Bid him bring his pen and inkhorn to the jail. We are now to examination these men. - And we must do it wisely. - Oh, we will want for no wit, I warrant you. Here's that shall drive some of them to a non-come. Only fetch our learned friend and have him write down my excommunications. Meet me at the jail. (gentle music) - You come hither, young Claudio, to marry this lady. - No. - To be married to her, father. You come to marry her. (laughing) - [Friar Francis] Sweet lady, you come hither to be married to young Claudio. - I do. - [Friar Francis] If either of you know any inward impediment why you should not be conjoined, I charge you on your souls to utter it. - Know you any, Hero? - None, my lord. - [Friar Francis] Know you any, Claudio? - I dare make his answer, none. - Ha, what men dare do, what men may do, what men daily do, not knowing what they do. - How now, interjections? Why, then, some be of laughing, as ah, ha, he. (laughing) - Father, will you with free and unconstrained soul give me this maid, your daughter? - Why as freely, son, as God did give her me. - And what have I to give you back, whose worth may counterpoise this rich and precious gift? - Nothing, unless you render her again. - Sir, you learn me noble thankfulness. There Leonato! (Hero yelling) Take her back again! Give not this rotten orange to your friend. - [Leonato] What do you mean? - Not to be married! Not to knit my soul to an approved wanton. - Wanton? - Behold how like a maid she blushes here. Would you not swear, all you that see her, that she were a maid by these exterior shows? (crowd yelling) But she is none! She knows the heat of a luxurious bed. Her blush is guiltiness, not modesty. - [Leonato] See here, you! - [Don John] Gentlemen, gentlemen, hold, hold. - If you, in your proof, and made defeat on her virginity- - No, Leonato, I never tempted her with word too large, but as a brother to his sister, showed bashful sincerity and comely love. - And seemed I ever otherwise to you? - Out on thee, seeming. I will write against it. You seem to me as Dian in her orb, as chaste as is the bud ere it be blown, but you are more intemperate in your blood than Venus or those pampered animals that rage in savage sensuality. (women screaming) - Is my lord well that he speak so wide? - [Leonato] Don Pedro, why speak not you? - What shall I speak? I stand dishonored that have gone about to link my dear friend to a common stale. - Are these things spoken, or do I but dream? - Sir, they are spoken and these things are true. - This looks not like a nuptial. - Oh God. - Leonato, stand I here? Is this Don Pedro? Is this Don Pedro's brother? Is this face Hero's? Are our eyes our own? - [Leonato] All this is so, but what of that? - Let me but move one question to your daughter, and by that fatherly and kindly power that you have in her, bid her answer truly. - I charge thee do so, as thou art my child. - Oh, God defend me. How am I beset? What kind of catechising call you this? - To make you answer truly to your name. - Is it not Hero? Who can blot that name with any just reproach? - Marry, that can Hero. Hero itself can blot out Hero's virtue. What man was he talked with you yesternight out at your window betwixt 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m.? Now, if you are a maid, answer to this. - I spoke with no man at that hour, my lord. - Why, then you are no maiden. Leonato, I am sorry you must hear. Upon mine honor, myself, my brother, the grieved Claudio did see her, hear her, at that hour last night talk with a ruffian at her chamber window who hath indeed, most like a liberal villain, confessed these vile encounters they have had a 1000 times in secret. - Fie, fie, they are not to be named, sir, not to be spoken. There is not chastity enough in language without offense to utter them. Thus, pretty lady, I am sorry for thy much misgovernment. - Ah, Hero, what a Hero hadst thou been. Fare thee well, most foul, most fair. Farewell, thou pure impiety and impious purity. For thee I lock up all the gates of love and turn all beauty into thoughts of harm and never shall it more be gracious. (Hero shrieking) - [Don John] Go, these things, come thus to light, smother her spirits up, come away, come. (screaming and crying) - Help, uncle, help! Captain, Captain! (crying) - Have comfort, lady. - [Beatrice] Now, cousin Hero. - Dost thou look up? - Yea, wherefore should she not? - Wherefore? Why, doth not every earthly thing cry shame upon her? Do not live, Hero! Do not ope thine eyes, for did I think thou wouldst not quickly die, I myself would strike at thy life. Grieved I, I had but one? Rail thy for that at frugal nature's frame? Oh, one too much by thee. Why had I one? Why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes? But mine and mine I loved and mine I praised, and mine that I was proud on, mine so much that I myself was to myself not mine, for valuing of her. Oh, she is fallen into a pit of ink. - Sir, sir, be patient. For my part, I am so attired in wonder, I know not what to say. - Oh, on my soul, my cousin is belied. - Lady, were you her bedfellow last night? - No. (Hero groaning) Truly not, but until last night, I have this twelve month been her bedfellow. - Aha, confirmed, confirmed. Would the two brothers lie and Claudio lie that loved her so, that speaking of her foulness, washed it with tears? Get hence from her. Let her die! - No, no, no. Hear me a little, for I've only been silent so long and given way unto this course of fortune. By noting of the lady, I have marked a thousand blushing apparitions to start into her face and in her eye there hath appeared a fire, to burn the errors these brothers hold against her maiden truth. Aye, call me a fool. Trust not my reverence, nor divinity, if this sweet lady stand not guiltless here under some biting error. Lady, what man is he you are accused of? - They know that do accuse me. I know none. If I know more of any man alive than that which maiden modesty doth warrant, let all my sins lack mercy. Oh my father, prove you that any man with me conversed at hours unmeet or that I yesternight maintained the change of words with any creature. Refuse me. Hate me. Torture me to death. - There is some strange misprision in these brothers. Pause awhile and let my counsel sway you in this case, aye. Your daughter here, the brothers left for dead. Let her awhile be secretly kept in and publish it that she is dead indeed. Aye, maintain a mourning ostentation, and on your family's old monument hang mournful epitaphs and do all rites that appertain unto a burial. - But what will become of this? What will this do? - She dying, as it must so be maintained, upon the instant that she was accused shall be lamented, pitied and excused of every hearer, and so it will fare with Claudio. When he shall hear she died upon his words, then shall he mourn, aye, and wish he had not so accused her. Let this be so and doubt not but success will follow and the supposition of the lady's death will quench the wonder of her infamy. - Good Leonato, let the father advise you and though you know my inwardness and love is very much unto Don Pedro and Claudio, yet will I deal as secretly in this as your soul would with your body. - Being that I flow in grief, the smallest twine shall lead me. - 'Tis well consented. Presently away, for to strange sores, strangely they strain the cure. Come lady, die to live. This wedding day perhaps is but prolonged. Have patience and endure. (somber music) - Fair Beatrice, have you wept all this while? - Yea, Captain and I will weep a while longer. - I will not desire that. - You have no reason. I do it freely. - Surely I do believe your fair cousin is wronged. - How much might the man deserve of me that would right her. - Is there any way to show such friendship? - A very even way, but no such friend. - May a man do it? - It is a man's office, but not yours. - I do love nothing in the world so well as you. Is not that strange? - As strange as the thing I know not. It were as possible for me to say I love nothing in the world so much as you, and yet believe me not, and yet I lie not. I confess nothing, nor I deny nothing. I am sorry for my cousin. - By my sword, Beatrice, thou lovest me. - Do not swear it and eat it. - I will swear by it that thou lovest me, and I will make him eat it that says I love not you. - Will you not eat your word? - With no sauce that can be devised to it. I protest, I love thee. - Why, then, God forgive me. - What offense, sweet Beatrice? - You have stayed me in a happy hour. I was about to protest that I love you. - And do it with all thy heart. - I love you with so much of my heart that there is none left to protest. (Beatrice crying) - Come, bid me do anything for thee. - Kill Claudio! - Ha! Not for the wide world. - You kill me to deny it. Farewell! - Tarry, good Beatrice! (Beatrice yelling) - I am gone, though I am here. There is no love in you. - Beatrice! - Nay, I pray you, let me go! Let me! (Benedick yelling) - [Benedick] We'll be friends first! - You dare easier be friends with me than fight with mine enemy. - Is Claudio thine enemy? - Is not approved in the height a villain, that has slandered, scorned, dishonored my kinswoman? What? Bear her in hand until they come to take hands, and then with public accusation, uncover slander, unmitigated rancor! (Beatrice screaming) God, that I were a man, I would eat his heart in the marketplace. - But hear me, Beatrice. - [Beatrice] Talk with a man out a window, a proper saying! - Nay, but, Beatrice- - Sweet Hero, she is wronged. She is slandered. She's undone. - Beatrice! (Beatrice screaming) - God, that I were a man, or that I had any friend t'would be a man for my sake, but manhood is only melted into courtesies, and valor into compliment, and men have only turned into tongue, and trim ones too. He is now as valiant as Hercules that only tells a lie and swears it. (Beatrice sneezing) I cannot be a man with wishing. Therefore I will die a woman with grieving. - By this hand, I love thee. - Use it for my love some other way than swearing by it. - Think you in your soul that Claudio hath wronged Hero? - Yea, as sure as I have a thought or a soul. - Enough, I am engaged. (gentle music) I will challenge him. I will kiss thy hand, and so I leave thee. By this hand, Claudio shall render me a dear account. (gentle music) As you hear of me, so think of me. Go, comfort your cousin. I must say she is dead and so, farewell. (gentle music) (jaunty music) - Is our whole dissembly appeared? - A cushion for the sexton. (jaunty music) - Which be the malefactors? - Marry, that am I, sir, and my partner. - Nay, that's certain. We have the exhibition to examine. (laughing) - But which are the offenders to be examined? Let them come before, master constable. - Aye, marry, sir, marry, sir. Let them come before me. (metal clanging) - Do you swear to the tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you-- - I do. - God. - What's your name, friend? - Borachio. - Pray, write down, Borachio. - Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you- - Yes, sir. - God. - Yours, sir? - I am a gentleman, sir, and my name is Conrade. - Write down, master gentleman Conrade. Sirs, do you serve God? - [Both] Yea, sir, we hope. - Write down they hope they serve God. Write God first, for God defend. but God should come before such villains. Masters, it is already proved against you that you are little better than false knaves. How answer you for yourselves? - Marry, sir, we say we are none. - A marvelous witty fellow, I assure you. I will go about with him. Come hither, sir. A word in your ear, sir. I say to you, sir, that it is thought that you are a false knave. - I tell you we are none. - Yes, well, stand aside, stand aside. Have uh, have you writ down that they are none? - Master constable, you go not the way to examine, you must call forth the watch that are their accusers. - Aye, marry, sir, marry, sir. That's the eftest way. Let the watch come forth. - Do you swear to tell the truth- - [Both] We do. (baton thudding) - Masters, I charge you in the governor's name, accuse these men. - This man said, sir, that Don John, Don Pedro's brother, was a villain. - Write down, Don John a villain. Why, that's flat perjury, to call Don Pedro's brother villain. - Master constable- - I pray thee, fellow, peace. I do not like thy look. I promise thee. - [Sexton] Master constable, what heard you him say else? - Marry, sir, that he had received a 1000 silver coin from Don John for accusing the Lady Hero wrongfully. - Flat burglary as was ever committed! - [Verges] By mass, that it is! (gavel thudding) - [Sexton] What else, fellow? - And that Claudio did mean, upon his words, to disgrace the lady Hero before the whole assembly and not marry her. - Oh thou villain! Thou wilt be condemned into everlasting redemption for this. (gavel thudding) - [Sexton] What else? - [Both] This is all. - And this is more, masters, than you can deny. Don John is this morning secretly stolen away. Hero was in this manner refused, and upon the grief of this suddenly died. - No, no, no! (gavel thudding) Master constable, let these men be bound and brought to Leonato's. I shall go before and show him their examination. - Come, let them be opinioned. - [Verges] Let them be in the hands- - Off coxcomb! - Oh, God's my life, where's the sexton? Sexton, sexton! Let him write down governor's officer, coxcomb. Oh, thou naughty varlet. Come, bind him. - Away. You are an ass. Oh, you are an ass. - Dost thou not suspect my place? Dost thou not suspect my years? Oh, that the sexton were here to write me down an ass, but, masters, remember I am an ass. Though it be not written down, forget not I am an ass. Oh, thou villain, thou art full of piety, as soon shall be proved against thee by good witness. I am a wise fellow enough and what is more, an officer, and what is more, a householder, and what is more, as pretty a piece of flesh as any in the county, and one who knows the law, go to, and a rich fellow enough, go to, and one who has had losses, go to, and one who has two suits and everything handsome about him, go to. Oh, bring him away. (melancholy music) Oh. oh, that I had been writ down an ass. (melancholy music) (hammer tapping) (somber music) - Brother! Brother, if you go on thus, you will kill yourself. 'Tis not wisdom thus to second grief against yourself. - I pray thee, cease thy counsel, which falls upon mine ear as profitless as water in a sieve. Bring me a father that so loved his child, whose joy of her so overwhelmed like mine, and bid him speak of patience. But there is no such man. For, brother, men can counsel and speak comfort to that grief which they themselves not feel, but, tasting it, their counsel turns to passion. - Thus do men from children nothing differ. - I pray thee, peace! I will be flesh and blood, for there was never yet philosopher that could endure the toothache patiently. - Yet bend not all harm upon yourself. Make those that do offend you suffer too. - Ah, there thou speaks reason. Nay, I will do so. My soul doth tell me Hero is belied, and that shall Claudio know and so shall Don Pedro and all those that thus dishonor her. - Here comes Don Pedro and Claudio now. - [Don Pedro] Good day, good day. - [Claudio] Good day to both of you. - Gentlemen, a word with you. - [Don Pedro] We have some haste, Leonato. - Some haste, Don Pedro? Well, fare you well. You so hasty now? Well, all is one. - Nay, do not quarrel with us, good old friend. - If he could right himself with quarreling, some of us would lie low. - [Claudio] Who wrongs him? Nay, never raise thy hand. I fear thee not. - Marry, beshrew my hand, if it should give your age such cause of fear. In faith, my hand meant nothing. - Tush, tush, man. Never fleer nor jest at me. I did not brag what I have done being young, or what would do were I not old. Know, Claudio, to thy head, you have so wronged my innocent child and me that I do challenge thee to trial of a man. I say that you, you have belied mine innocent child. Your slanders have gone through and through her heart till now she lies buried with her ancestors. Oh, in a tomb where never scandal slept, save this of hers, framed by your villainy. - My villainy? - Yours, I say, yours! - Say not right, old man! - I'll prove it on his body, if he dare. - Please, I will not have to do with you. - Can you so daff me? You killed my child. If you kill me, boy, you kill a man. - He shall kill two of us and men indeed. Let him kill one first. Let him answer me. Come, boy. Come, follow me! Come, sir, boy. Follow me. Come. Come, sir, boy. I'll whip you. Nay, as I am a gentleman, I will. - But, brother. - Hold you content. God knows I loved my niece and she is dead, slandered to death by villains that dare as well answer a man indeed as I dare take a serpent by the tongue. Boys, apes, braggarts, Jacks, milksops. - But, brother Anthony- - Hold you. Hold you content. What, what man? I know them, yea, scrambling, out facing, fashion-monging boys that slander, lie, deprave. Go anticly and speak off half a dozen dangerous words. How they might hurt their enemies, if they durst, and this is all. - But, brother- - Please, 'tis no matter. Do not you meddle. Let me deal in this. (grunting) - Gentlemen, both, we will not wake your patience. My heart is sorry for your daughter's death, but on mine honor, she was charged with nothing but what was true and very full of proof. - [Leonato] Sir. - I will not hear you. (somber music) - No? I will be heard. - And shall, or some of us will smart for it! (somber music) (crickets chirping) - We had like to have had our two noses snapped off by two old men without teeth, Leonato and his brother. - You are a villain. I jest not. I will make it good how you dare, when you dare, with what you dare. Do me right, or I will protest your cowardice. You have killed an innocent young lady and her death shall fall heavy upon you. Let me hear from you. - Uh, I will meet you, so I may have good cheer! (foghorn sounding) - Good day, sir. - Good day, Benedick. As I am a man, you look pale. Art thou sick or angry? I'll tell thee how Beatrice praised thy wit this other day. I said, thou hadst a fine wit. "True," said she, "a fine little one." No, said I, a great wit. "Right," says she, "a great." - [Both] "Gross one." - No, said I, a good wit. "Just," says she, "it hurts nobody." Thus did she, an hour together, transshape thy particular virtues. Yet at the last she concluded with a sigh. Thou wast the properest man in the country. - For the which she wept heartily and said she cared not. - Yea, that she did and if she did not hate him deadly, she would love him dearly. They have told us all. - All, all, and, moreover, God saw him when he was hid in the garden. (laughing) - But when shall we set the savage bull's horns on the sensible Benedick's head? - [Claudio] Yea and text underneath, "Here dwells Benedick the married man." - Fare you well, boy. You know my mind. I will leave you now to your gossip-like humor. You break jests as braggarts do their blades, which God be thanked, hurt not. Sir, for your many courtesies I thank you. I must discontinue your company. You have among you killed a sweet and innocent young lady. Your brother, the bastard, has fled the county. For my Lord Lackbeard there, he and I shall meet, and until then, peace be with him. (birds cawing) - He is in earnest. - In most profound earnest and I'll warrant you, for the love of Beatrice. - And hath challenged thee? - Most sincerely, sir. - But, soft, did he not say my brother was fled? How now? Two of my brother's men bound, Borachio one. - [Claudio] Hearken after their offense, sir. - [Don Pedro] Masters? What offense have these men done? - Marry, sir, they have committed false report. Moreover, they have spoken untruths. Secondarily, they are slanders. Sixth and lastly, they have belied a lady. Thirdly, they have verified unjust things, and to conclude, they are lying knaves. - Firstly, I ask thee what they have done. Thirdly, what is their offense? Sixth and lastly, what have they committed? And to conclude, what do you lay to their charge? - Rightly reasoned and in his own division. - Marry, that it is, sir. - Who have you offended, masters? This learned constable is too cunning to be understood. What's your offense? - Good Don Pedro, let me go no farther to mine answer. Do you hear me? And let this man kill me. What your wisdoms could not discover, these shallow fools have brought to light, who in the night overheard me confessing to this man how Don John your brother incensed me to slander the Lady Hero, how you were brought into the orchard and saw me court Margaret in Hero's garments, how you disgraced her, when you should marry her. My villainy they have upon the record, which I had rather seal with my death than repeat over to my shame. The lady is dead upon mine and my master's false accusation, and briefly, I desire nothing but the reward of a villain. - Runs not this speech like iron through your blood? - I have drunk poison whiles he uttered it. - But did my brother set thee onto this? - Yea and paid me richly for the practice of it. - He is composed and framed in treachery, and fled he is upon this villainy. (whistle shrieking) - Bring in the plaintiffs! By this time, the sexton has reformed Leonato of the matter. (doorbell ringing) And masters, do not forget to specify, when time and place shall serve, that I am an ass. (doorbell ringing) - Sweet Hero, now thy image doth appear in the rare semblance that I loved it first. (gentle music) (clock ticking) (clock chiming) - Which is the villain? Let me see his eyes, Which of these is he? - If you would know your wronger, look on me. - Art thou the slave that with thy breath has killed mine innocent child? - Yea, even I alone. - Not so, villain. Here come a pair of honorable men. A third is fled, that had a hand in it. I thank you, gentlemen, for my daughter's death. Record it with your high and worthy deeds. 'Twas nobly done, when you bethink you of it. - Sir, I know not how to pray your patience. Choose your revenge yourself. Impose me to what penance your invention can lay upon my sin, yet sinned I not but in mistaking. - By my soul, nor I and yet to satisfy this good old friend, I'll bend under any heavy weight he'll enjoin me to. - I cannot bid thee bid my daughter live. That were impossible, but I pray you both, possess the people in the county here how innocent she died, and if your love can labor ought in sad invention, hang her an epitaph upon her grave. Sing it at her tomb. Sing it tonight and tomorrow morning come you to this house and since you could not be my son-in-law, be yet my nephew. My brother hath a daughter almost the copy of my child that's dead. Give her the right you should have given her cousin, and so dies my revenge. - Oh, sir, your over kindness doth wring tears from me. I do embrace your offer. - Tomorrow morning then I will expect your coming. Tonight, I'll leave you. This naughty fellow shall face to face be brought with Margaret, who I believe was packed in all this wrong, hired to it by your brother. - No, by my soul, she was not, nor knew not what she did when she spoke to me, but always hath been just and virtuous in any thing I do know by her. - Moreover, sir, this plaintiff here, this offender, did call me ass. Oh, I beseech you. Let that be remembered in his punishment. Moreover, he borrows money in God's name, the which he keeps so long and pays nothing back that men grow hard hearted and will lend nothing, for God's sake. I pray you, question them upon that point. - I thank thee for thy care and honest pain. - Aye, your worship speaks like a most reverent and thankful youth and I praise God for you. - Here, here's for thy pains. - God save the foundation. - Go, I discharge thee of thy prisoner and I thank you. (gentle music) - I leave an arrant knave with your worship, which I beseech your worship to correct yourself for the example of others. God keep your worship. I wish your worship well. May God restore you to health. I humbly give you leave to depart, and if a merry meeting be desired, why, God prohibit it. Come, neighbor. (gentle music) - Until tomorrow morning, gentlemen, farewell. - Farewell. We look for you tomorrow. - We will not fail you. - Tonight I'll mourn with Hero. - Come, take these fellows away. We'll talk with Margaret how her acquaintance grew with this lewd fellow. (Leonato sighing) (laughing) (gentle music) ♪ The God of love ♪ There sits above ♪ And knows me ♪ And knows me ♪ How pitiful I deserve I mean in singing. But in loving. (upbeat music) Romeo himself was never so truly turned over and over as my poor self in love. (gentle music) (upbeat music) (sentimental music) (upbeat music) (gentle music) (upbeat music) (gentle music) I cannot woo in festival terms. (door knocking) (sentimental music) (door knocking) Fair Beatrice, wouldst thou come when I called thee? - Yea, Captain, and depart when you bid me. - [Benedick] Oh, stay but till then. - Then is spoken. Fare you well now and yet, ere I go, let me go with that I came for, which is with knowing what hath passed between you and Claudio. - Only foul words and thereupon will I kiss thee. - Foul words is but foul wind and foul wind is but foul breath, and foul breath is noisome. Therefore I will depart unkissed. - Thou hast started the word out of it's right sense, so forcible is thy wit, but I must tell thee plainly. Claudio undergoes my challenge and either I shall shortly hear from him, or I will describe him a coward. And now tell me, for which of my bad parts didst thou first fall in love with me? - For them altogether, which maintained so politic a state of evil that they would not admit any good parts to intermingle with them. (wrapper crackling) But for which of my good parts did you first suffer love for me? (cork popping) - Suffer love, a good epithet. I suffer love indeed, for I love thee against my will. - In spite of your heart, I think. Alas, poor heart. If you spite it for my sake, I will spite it for yours, for I can never love that which my friend hates. (glasses clinking) (sentimental music) - Thou and I are too wise to woo peaceably. - It appears not in this confession, for there is not one wise man among 20 that will praise himself. - An old, an old instance, Beatrice, that lived in the time of good neighbors. If a man in this age will not erect his own tomb ere he dies, he shall live no longer in monument than the bell tolls or the widow weeps. - And how long is that, think you? - Question, an hour and a quarter. Therefore, it is most expedient for the wise, if his conscience, Don Worm, find no impediment to the contrary, to be the trumpet of his own virtues, as I am to myself. So much for praising myself, who, I myself will bear witness is praiseworthy and now tell me, how doth thy cousin? - Very ill. - And how do you? - Very ill too. - Serve God, love me, and mend. (music slowing) - [Ursula] Beatrice! Beatrice! Beatrice! - Yoo hoo hoo. - Oh, you must come to your uncle! Yonder is old coil at home. It is proved my Lady Hero hath been falsely accused. (laughing) Don Pedro and Claudio mightily abused, and Don John is the author of all, who is fled and gone. (insects chirping) Oh. (lightly giggling) Will you come presently? (giggling) (gentle music) - Will you come hear this news, Captain? - I will live in thy heart, die in thy lap, and be buried in thine eyes. Moreover I will come with thee to thine uncle's. (sentimental music) (thunder crashing) (somber music) ♪ Pardon, goddess of the night ♪ Those that slew thy virgin knight ♪ ♪ For the which ♪ With songs of woe ♪ Round about her tomb they go ♪ Heavily ♪ Midnight, assist our moan ♪ Help us to sigh and groan ♪ Heavily ♪ Heavily ♪ Heavily ♪ Graves, yawn and yield your dead ♪ ♪ Till death be uttered ♪ Heavily ♪ Heavily ♪ Heavily ♪ Heavily ♪ Heavily ♪ Oh (somber music) - [Claudio Voiceover] Now, unto thy bones good night. Yearly will I do this rite. (somber music) (birds chirping) - Good morrow, masters. Put your candles out. The wolves have preyed and look the gentle day. Before the wheels of Phoebus, round about, dapples the drowsy east with spots of gray. Thanks to you all and leave us. Fare you well. - Good morrow, each his several way. (gentle instrumental music) - Let us hence and put on other weeds, and then to Leonato's will we go. - And to love God now with lucky issue speeds than this for whom we rendered up this woe. (somber music) - Did I not tell you she was innocent? - So are Don Pedro and Claudio, but Margaret was in some fault for this, although against her will, as it appears in the true course of the question. - Well, I am glad that all things sort so well. - And so am I too, being else by faith enforced to call young Claudio to a reckoning for it. (clock ticking) - Daughter and you gentlewomen all, withdraw you into a chamber by yourselves and when I call for you, come hither masked. (laughing) - Father. (clock chiming) - Don Pedro and Claudio did promise by this hour to visit me. Brother, you know your office. You are to be the father to your brother's daughter and give her to young Claudio. - Which I will do with confirmed countenance. (laughing) - To do what, Captain? - To bind me or undo me, one of them. Leonato, truth it is, good sir, your niece regards me with an eye of favor. - That eye my daughter lent her, 'tis most true. - And I do with an eye of love requite her. - But what's your will? - My will is your good will should stand with ours this day to be conjoined in the state of honorable marriage, in the which office, good father, I shall desire your help. - My will is with your liking. (laughing) - And my help. - And here comes Don Pedro and young Claudio now. - Good morrow to this fair assembly. - Good morrow, Don Pedro. Good morrow, Claudio. Are you still determined to marry with my brother's daughter? - Yes, sir. - Call her forth, brother. - Gentlemen. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Here's Father Francis. - [Claudio] Father. - You ready? - Good morrow, Benedick. - Ha. - Why, what's the matter? What means this February face, so full of frost, of storm and cloudiness? - I think he thinks upon the savage bull. (gentle music) Which is the lady I must seize upon? - This same is she, and I do give you her. - Why, then she's mine. Sweet, let me see your face. - Ah ah, that you shall not until you take her hand before this priest and swear to marry her. - Give me your hand. Before this holy father, I am your husband, if you like of me. - And when I lived, I was your other wife, (crowd gasping) and when you loved, you were my other husband. - Another Hero! - Nothing certainer. One Hero died defiled, but I do live, and surely as I live, I am a maid. - The former Hero! Hero that is dead! - She died, sir, but whiles her slanders lived. - All this amazement can I qualify. When after the holy rites are ended, I'll tell you largely of fair Hero's death. Meantime let wonder seem familiar and to the chapel let us all presently. (laughing) - Soft and fair, father. Which is Beatrice? - I answer to that name. What is your will? - Do not you love me? - Why, no, no more than reason. - Why, then your uncle and Don Pedro and Claudio have been deceived. They did swear you did. - Do not you love me? - Why, no, no more than reason. - Why, then my cousin and Ursula and Margaret are much deceived, for they did swear you did. - They swore you were almost sick for me! - They swore you were well nigh dead for me! - 'Tis no such matter! Then you do not love me? - No, truly! - Ha! (birds chirping) - But in friendly recompense. - Come, niece, I'm sure you love the gentleman. - And I'll be sworn upon it that he loves her, for here's a note written in his hand, a halting sonnet of his own pure brain, fashioned to Beatrice. (laughing) - And here's another writ in my cousin's hand, stolen from her pocket, containing her affection unto Benedick. (chuckling) - A miracle, here's our own hands against our hearts. Come, I will have thee, but by this light, I take thee for pity. - I would not deny you, but, upon this good day, I yield upon great persuasion and partly to save your life, for I was told you that you have consumption. - Peace, I will stop your mouth. - How dost thou, Benedick, the married man? - I tell thee what, Don Pedro, a college of wit crackers cannot flout me out of my humor. Dost thou think I care for a satire or an epigram? No, and a man will be beaten with brains to show and nothing handsome about him. In brief, since I do purpose to marry, I will think nothing to any purpose that the world can say against it, and therefore never flout at me for what I have said against it, for, man is a giddy thing, and this is my conclusion. (birds chirping) For thy part, Claudio, I had thought to have beaten thee, but as thou art like to be my kinsman, live unbruised and love my cousin. - For thy part, Benedick, I had thought to have beaten thee. - Come, come! (laughing) We are friends. Let's have a dance ere we be married, that we may lighten our own hearts and our wives' heels. - We'll have dancing afterward. - First, of my word, therefore play music. (gentle music) Don Pedro, thou art sad. Get thee a wife. Get thee a wife! There is no staff more reverend than that tipped with horn. (whistle blaring) - Sir, sir, the watch have comprehended your brother John and brought him back to the city in monocles. (crowd cheering) - Think not on him till tomorrow. I'll devise thee brave punishments for him. Strike up the bells. (bells chiming) (upbeat music) (sentimental music) (lively music)
