[instrumental music] [intense music] [ripping] [muffled voice] [music continues] [man on PA] Every single vote has been counted. The students of Jefferson High have spoken. It's with great pleasure I introduce you to this year's winner. Jefferson High, say hello to the 'Most Inspirational' student of the year... [intense music] [woman on video] Okay, so you always wanna make sure you're doing real small, hair-like strokes. That way it always looks natural and you don't wanna overdo it because, like I said, keeping it natural is the key. [mellow music] You always want to be careful on the tail. If you extend it too much, it's gonna look little weird. If you don't fill it enough, it's gonna look a little weird. So it might take a little bit of practice, but as long as you're just going real light with your pencil, you'll be fine. -[grunts] -[clatters] -[knocking on door] -[sobbing] [Laura] Casey? You-you okay? Yeah, Mom. I'm... I'm fine. [Laura] Honey, I-I-I know it's a big day, but it.. -Look, if you're not feeling-- -I said I'm fine. [Laura] All right. Be ready to leave in ten. [scoffs] Here you go, love. Thanks. Oh, look who's finally up. Good morning, your highness. I'm talking to you. Morning, Harlen. How's the coffee? Can we get you anything else? Morning, honey. You want some breakfast, or... Uh, no. I'm good with just the coffee. -Okay. -I'll meet you in the car. All right, honey, I'll see you in a second. All right, honey, I'm out of here. You know, your daughter's got a mouth on her. Honey, I'm sure she doesn't mean anything by it. She's just a teenager. Yeah, you gotta stop making excuses for her. Some day somebody's gonna teach her some manners. Just give her time, okay? Will I, uh, see you tonight? Yeah. [door opens and shuts] [upbeat music] [Laura] Honey, you're, you're gonna be late. Well, I would rather be late and presentable than on time and look like a freak. Look at me. Honey... You are not a freak. Okay? Try telling that to Hailey Jeffers. Hey, whatever happened to that girl? You guys used to be so close. Yeah, you have no idea how cruel girls can be. [sighs] Can you even blame her for making fun of me? I mean, look at this wig, it looks like you got it from the Dollar Store. [sighs] I'm sorry. Just it's... It's the best we can do right now. [sighs] Honey... Are you sure you're ready? It's not like I have a choice, if I miss anymore school, they could make me repeat the year. I knew I had to go back eventually. [gasps] Oh, my God! What are you doing? -Is he gone? -[Laura] Yes. He's halfway out of the county. -Did he see me? -No, honey, I don't think so. [sighs] Of course. Of course, of all people, Vance Ellington would see me. -Stupid wig! -Honey... Maybe you just... Here's your... Maybe you should take your inhaler. -Honey, maybe-- -I'm fine! Mom, I'm sorry. It's fine. It's fine. You really should get going. ♪ you're gonna need a ladder just to get up to my level ♪ ♪ You're gonna need a ladder just to get up to my level ♪ ♪ So keep on climbing keep on climbing ♪ ♪ Never gonna catch me ♪ ♪ Keep on climbing keep on climbing never... ♪♪ Dream on, freak. Guys like Vance don't have to dumpster dive to get laid. Hailey, it is my first day back. Are we supposed to feel bad that you had a month vacation? Well, it's not a vacation if I had to do all of my schoolwork. Just let me get through today. What do you think, Clair? Would a boy like Vance even notice Casey? I think I know a way. [gasps] [both laughing] give it back! Stop, please! Look, we used to be friends, remember? Oh, I remember in junior high when you used to call me after school to fat-shame Clair behind her back. What was that awful nickname you gave her? Chocolaty Clair? I'm sorry, okay? Just please, don't! Karma's a bitch. [dramatic music] God, it's so sad. I'm like, not even enjoying this. [laughing] [door opens] [sobbing] [door shuts] [Lavalier] Okay, what are the three most important things we're focusing on when we write our informative speech? -[Lavalier] Reagan? -Content, structure, and... [door opens] Casey? Glad to have you back. Perhaps tomorrow you can try and be on time. Sorry, Mr. Lavalier. [Lavalier] so while your speeches are informative, remember, choosing something you have a close personal connection with will only help you. If you are passionate about a topic, others will be, too. I want you to keep that in mind for the next class. We're gonna pair up to share ideas... Is it just me, or does it smell like a toilet in here? [Clair laughs] -[Lavalier] ...Content. [marker tapping on board] I cannot believe we're staying on campus like a couple of plebes. I didn't have time to do my science homework last night. But you're welcome to go without me. Is it cool if I join you, I was hoping I could pick your brain about tonight's routine. Now's not a good time, Hailey. Oh. Sure, totally. Later, then? Okay. Great. Bye, Taylor. [Reagan] Hey, one thing. What's the deal with you and that girl from speech? Who, Casey? I heard you and Clair making fun of her. [scoffs] Trust me, she deserves it. Don't be fooled by her whole quiet-mouse routine. Casey's the original Regina George. -A real monster, that one. -No, I'm serious. She's a garbage person in every sense of the word. [Reagan] You know what I see? Easy pickings for an insecure vulture. That's not a good look, for you, or for the squad. Start acting like a decent human being, or don't bother coming to the game tonight. -Are you serious? -Deadly. We're done here. See you at practice! [Reagan] What do you know about her? [Taylor] Just the rumors. She, like, freaked out or something the first couple of weeks into the semester. Got sent home for a month. Why? Life's hard enough for some people without the Haileys of the world making it worse. I mean, look at her, it's her first day back, she's eating alone. You know, you don't have to take every injured bird you find under your wing. If I don't, who will? [mellow music] you're Casey, right, from speech? Yeah, Casey. Sorry, hi. I don't know if we've actually ever talked. I'm Reagan. I know. Everyone knows. I was wondering, do you already have a partner for speech? It's fine if you do, I just can't bear the thought of pairing up with Kyle again. If I have to listen to him talk about baseball one more time-- -you want to partner with me? -Why not? It'll give us a chance to get to know each other. So, what do you say? Yeah. Yeah, I... I'd really like that. Lookin' forward to it, partner. [cutlery clinking] so how was your first day back? Pretty much as I expected. Though I did kind of make a friend. Honey, that's amazing! I'm proud of you. I, uh, I hear that there's a, a big football game tonight. That could be kind of fun. For who? I spend all day at school. Watch the sass. [Laura] Well, I remember when you used to have school spirit. Oh, my, you remember you and Clair and Hailey in those cute little cheerleading outfits? Those were so cute! Well, I'm not in junior high anymore, Mom. Nobody wants to see me cheer. -That's not true. -Yes, it is. Everybody else is honest about it, why can't you be? What did I say? You're not a part of this conversation. Casey... What? He's not my dad! You better watch your tone. Or what? What are you gonna do? [intense music] do you really wanna find out? You're overdue for some discipline. Isn't that right, Laura? Mom? Unbelievable! [door opens] [door shuts] What? Nothin'. [mellow music] nice night for a walk. Sean? It's good to see you, Casey. It's been a while. I thought you were in Nevada. Yup. It was about time I came home. I'm, uh, crashing at Daniel's right now. Oh. You look good. I've been looking forward to seeing you. Like old times. So, uh, how long are you in town for? [exhales] At least long enough to make a little travel money. My offer still stands, by the way. I hear Washington is beautiful. What, and leave all this behind? You can joke all you want, but I'm serious. Sean... You got plenty of time to think about it. Mm, at least till the cops catch wind, then I'm back. About what you did for me back then, I never got a chance to say thank you. It was a long time coming. And trust me, I was gonna have to run regardless. For now, though, I'm, I'm staying put. Good. Hey, I, uh, I hate to cut this short-- No, I should, I should get going, anyway. See you around, Sean. [intense music] fifteen minutes, people. Did you hate it? No, of course not. Though, uh, it is a bit dry. -I knew it. -Hey, come on. It's not bad. It's just all facts and figures. I mean, we're talking about fire here. Spice it up a little. Didn't you ever, I don't know, use a lighter as a kid and burn yourself? Something vivid we can all relate to. Well, I did have something else in there, but I took it out. Great. Let's hear it. Okay, um, well, I'm sure you noticed, but you know how I wear this wig? About a year ago, my house kind of burned down. Oh, my God. I had to pull my mom out of the flames. And in the process, my hair just kind of poof. Is all of this why you were out of school for so long? After the accident, I lost most of my friends, started failing classes. And one day it just became too much, so I broke down in the crowd. I landed in the school shrink's office. They sent me on a month-long emotional leave of absence. I don't know if they thought a month would actually fix anything, because I'm still a disaster. Don't say that. I know what I look like. I obsess over it every day. I guess I don't feel comfortable talking about it, so I cut it. I don't wanna give them anything else to laugh at. Casey, who'd laugh about something like this? Nobody's that cruel. I can think of someone. [Hailey and Clair laughing] They don't count. They're not technically people. I think Hailey is part banshee or something. [Reagan] Speaking for myself, I'm glad I got to know this side of you. And I'm sure the rest of the class would feel the same way. So if you're up for it, I think you should talk about it. Okay, come on. You haven't torn apart my speech yet. [instrumental music] Hey, Casey. I gotta head to cheer practice. You wanna walk with me? Uh... There aren't any spots left on the team, but you're junior, right? Yeah. Well, if you want, you could come to practice and see what it's like. Maybe think about cheering next year. Uh, I don't know if that's such a good idea. Why not? If it's lack of interest, I get it. It's not. Well, then you should think about it. Really. If you want something, like, really want it, you're gonna have to put yourself out there. I'll think about it. Okay. Give me your phone. Here is my number in case you wanna practice your speech or just talk, whatever. Don't be a stranger, okay? I won't. I think she's in love. What do you want? To talk, about you and Reagan. What are you up to? -I'm not up to anything. -Oh, yeah? Because as of yesterday, Reagan's not even talking to me. Well, maybe she finally realized how awful you are. [scoffs] Okay. I think we need to help you remember who you really are. -Clair? -No. No, give it back! I will. After practice. Unless, you want us to show it to Reagan. I'd pay to see that. What do you think she'd say seeing pictures of herself on your phone? That's what I thought. Stay away from Reagan. If you're good, we'll give it back after practice. You're not one of us. Save yourself some heartache and move on. Okay. [grunting] [panting] ♪ J-H-S ♪ ♪ Remember our name ♪ ♪ We are the Hornets and we'll bring the pain ♪ ♪ Now let's hear you yell and scream ♪ ♪ for the Jefferson High School Team ♪ ♪ Go Big Green ♪ ♪ Go Big Green ♪ [alarm blaring] [screaming] -Oh, my God! -Oh, my God! [woman] Are you okay? [indistinct chatter] Someone help! [groaning] -Someone help! I know this isn't an easy conversation. I guess I just, I don't understand why we're here. We're not saying Casey had anything to do with what happened, however, someone pulled that fire alarm and Clair wound up with a broken leg. I already told you, it wasn't me. Reagan told us you walked her to practice. So all I'm asking is, did you see anyone pull that alarm or do you have any idea why someone would break into Clair's locker? I don't know anything! Is Clair accusing me or something? No, no, of course not, and apparently nothing was stolen. But we do have a responsi-- So if you're, if you're not accusing her and she doesn't know anything, then I think... I guess we're done here. I am, I'm sorry to take up your time. Ah, it's fine. I, I hope you find who's responsible. -Come on, sweetheart. -Actually, Laura. Do you mind if I borrow you for just one more sec? And, Casey, if you ever wanna start having our regular sessions again, my door is always open. That's nice. But I'm doing a lot better now. [instrumental music] [door shuts] Sorry you had to take off of work. Honey, it-it's fine, I'm-I'm sure I could pick up another shift tonight. Casey! Hey! Reagan, hi. What are you doing here? They questioned me earlier. I just wanted to make sure you were okay. You're not in trouble, right? I told them you walked me to practice, but nobody thinks-- No, no, everything's fine. I promise. Hi, sorry. I'm so rude. I'm Reagan, Casey's friend. Hi. Laura. Nice to meet you. You know, Casey, Taylor is coming over tonight to hang out. Do you wanna come? If that's alright. We'll probably just order a pizza or something. Yeah, Mom, can I? You said you were gonna try to work later. Yeah, yeah, honey, I-I suppose that would be fine. -Sure. -[Reagan] Awesome. And I can give you a lift home tonight, too, of course. -Okay, Mom, I'll see you later? -Okay, honey. -It was really nice to meet you. -It was so nice to meet you. -Have fun, girls. -Thanks. [upbeat music] [Taylor] Ha-ha! I'm just saying. How is that insensitive? Clair is not exactly the brightest crayon in the box. So maybe she just took the whole break-a-leg thing a little too literally. Come on, she's hurt! So she fractures a couple of bones and all of a sudden she's a saint? Look, we're not going to her funeral, Reagan. I'm sorry about Taylor. You'll get used to her unique sense of humor. Oh, it's okay. I actually don't disagree. Yes, thank you! See, Casey's a stone-cold bitch just like me. [chuckles] Do I have sauce on my face? Oh, no, sorry. I, I didn't mean to stare. It's just, you're so pretty. How do you get your eyebrows like that? Oh, bathing in the blood of the freshmen. It's a lot of work, but a girl's eyebrows say a lot about her. So I put in the time. I could show you, if you want. You could? OMG. I smell a makeover. Come. Sit. [Casey] Okay. Okay, you have naturally beautiful eyes and you should consider contacts. Okay, let me see. So, first, what I'm gonna do is just take off some of the product you already have on because you don't need to use quite so much. And then the key to getting perfect natural-looking brows is just using little hair-like strokes like this. And I post videos of my techniques if you ever need a refresher. Are you on instagram? Kind of. Not really, I don't have many followers. Ooh, we can fix that. [phone camera clicks] [laughing] [Taylor] Well, look at that. I think there's a diamond in them hills. Why are you being so nice to me? I know what it's like, getting picked on. No, she's not kidding. Freshman-year Reagan was a real ugly duckling. It's true. I was a late bloomer. And the popular girls made sure I knew it every single day. It got so bad that I woke up every morning hoping I would be sick. Any excuse to stay home from school. What did you do? Thankfully, I grew into myself and found some inner confidence, then I came back sophomore year a different person. By then the girls who tormented me had graduated and I got a fresh start. It was a really rough year. And it would have been so much easier if somebody had just helped me out a little. Thank you for helping me out. That's what friends are for. [mellow music] [cell phone chimes] [intense music] [Sean] I know it's not the Taj Mahal, but at least it's a place to crash. Yeah, no, it was very nice of Daniel to give you his garage to crash in. So what is a nice girl like you doing knocking on my door in the middle of the night? [music playing on stereo] Get your mind out of the gutter. I'm just here to ask a favor. Okay, well, how may I be of service? Well, I, uh, I need your help getting some... 'stuff.' Some stuff? Come on, don't play dumb, Sean. I know you're dealing. Nothing crazy, okay? Just some painkillers, maybe, and the good stuff. It's not for me, okay? It's, it's for a friend. Yeah, no, of course, I mean, it's always for a friend. You know you can talk to me... If something's wrong. What are you, the dealer with a conscience? Isn't this your job? Sorry. Just help me out. [indistinct chatter] Casey! Hey. You look great. I, uh... thanks. -You inspired me. -I'm flattered. Hey, do you know Vance? Hey. Reagan's been talking non-stop about you. It's nice to meet you. Sorry. Uh... Hi. Real smooth, Case. Are you ready for your speech? Oh, yeah. It was nice meeting you. You, too. I'll see you around. Work it, Case! Slay Mama! [intense music] Every day seven people in the United States die in house fires. And while the overall fire death rate has dropped 15.8 percent over the past ten years, it still remains a major safety concern. Luckily, there are several steps one can take to help safeguard against this horrible disaster. Casey, is everything all right? [mellow music] look, I know this isn't exactly riveting and I could tell you about how horrible house fires really are, but none of you would get it, not really. Unless I show you. Get up. [all gasping] -Oh, my God! A year ago, my house caught on fire. And it took everything. All I have left from my old life is in a small box in my closet. This is all that's left, and it may never fully grow back. My lungs suffered so much smoke inhalation that I have to carry an inhaler whenever I get short breath. [voice breaking] and my dad... H-he didn't make it out. [music continues] [sobbing] sorry. My entire life changed that day. The person that I was got caught in the flames and... This is what emerged from the ashes. So, please, do me a favor and listen to these safety tips, because, who knows... They could save your life. [intense music] I can't imagine how hard that must have been. But it sounds totally badass. I bet you totally traumatized Mr. L. Oh, you should have seen his face. Oh, a part of me felt totally humiliated, but another part of me felt, I don't know, liberated, for just owning it like that. Thank you for encouraging me to do it. Please, all I did was nudge. So I was thinking, with Clair out for the foreseeable future, the squad is a girl short. If you wanted to cheer... Seriously? Yeah, of course. Just let me know when you're ready. We can try you out any time. -I will. -See you later. [door opens] [door shuts] that was quite the show you put on today. I mean, I knew you were desperate for attention, but, wow. [scoffs] [cell phone beeps] [Casey on video] All I have left from my old life is in... You recorded me? A shame only our class got to see it. Such an inspirational unveiling deserves a wider audience. If you like, I could post it. -What do you want? -For you to tell the truth. Admit you're the reason Clair broke her leg, and I'll delete it. I don't know what you're talking about. God, you are such a liar. You don't need to play innocent with me. I know who you really are. [intense music] you don't know who I am anymore. Of course I do. A tiger doesn't change its stripes. And I think you'd do anything to keep this from going viral. I am not going to admit to anything. You're absolutely sure about that? Okay, then. [cell phone beeps] -it's live. I'm sure you'll be a meme in no time. Hey, Hailey. What's going on? Just getting ready for practice. [Taylor] Yeah, I see. You know, your bullying is very unbecoming of the squad. -I wasn't bullying-- -oh, enough. Look, if it was up to me, you'd be gone already. But now you get to explain yourself to Reagan. And you better hope that she forgives your sorry ass. Let's go. [door opens] [intense music] [telephone ringing] This is Deborah. [sobbing] is this the school counselor? Yes? I-is everything okay? What's your name? [sobbing] I didn't know who else to call. It's my friend. Hailey Jeffers. I saw her take some pills at school. I don't want her to get in trouble, I just... I-I just didn't know what else to do. No, y-you're doing the right thing. Now, who-who is this? Hello? Hello? [intense music] [indistinct radio chatter] Hailey, I need to see your backpack. -My backpack? -Yes, your backpack. Okay. [indistinct radio chatter] [intense music] -uh, th-those aren't mine. -Turn around. They're-they're not mine. I didn't put them in there. No, but they're not mine. I didn't put them in there. -What happened? -I'll tell you later. [indistinct radio chatter] I can't believe she would do something like that posting that video. Hailey's always had it out for me. Yeah, well, she won't be bothering you anymore. Wait. We're eating here? Yeah. Found this little gem on yelp. Two stars, kind of a dump, but the coffee's great. Coming? Of course. Hm, Ms. Paulson? Hey, girls. Hi, honey. Well, I can tell that Casey is mortified. So how about I get you all seated? You can sit right here. Can I, uh, get you girls some coffee? Ooh, you read my mind. Casey, why didn't you tell us your mom works here? I don't know. It's... -It's embarrassing. -[Taylor] No, it's not. At least your mom has a job. All my mom does is drink chardonnay and watch food network all day. Did you really think we would care where your mom works? Casey, we're your friends. It's so not a big deal. So... Have you checked Instagram recently? No, I do not want to know what people are saying about the video. -Why? -'Cause you're internet famous. Well, in our little corner of the world. [Casey] The whole school has seen it. [Reagan] It went viral. People are actually reposting clips from it. -Am I some kind of joke? -[Taylor] Casey. Calm down. Read the comments. [Reagan] Everyone's talking about how real your speech was. -It was inspirational. -[Taylor] Yeah. If Hailey was trying to humiliate you, it completely backfired. And look at the hashtags. "Hashtag most inspirational?" Hey, does that mean I'm nominated? Most inspirational? What is that? It's a pretty big deal. Every year the school votes for the person they felt had the most positive impact. Yeah, it's like homecoming queen, but more meaningful. And they broadcast the winner on the school news show. And all of these people want it to be you? Honey, that's amazing! Yeah, it is. You deserve it, Casey. And, like it or not, you're not gonna be able to just blend into the background anymore. Well, this calls for pie. Your mom is my favorite person. Case, you okay? I don't know. It... I mean, look at me. I can't win a popularity contest. This is literally the nicest outfit that I own. -Oh, we can help with that. -Yeah. ♪ Waiting for you ♪ What's taking so long? Are you ready? [claps] Come on already! -Oh! [applauding] [chuckling] ♪ I can lean on you yeah ♪ ♪ Get me through this time ♪ ♪ I'm looking at my life ♪ Thanks again for all these clothes, Reagan. Please, you're doing me a favor. My mom's been telling me to clean out my closet for months. Well, still, I don't know how I'm ever gonna pay you back. Here, let us help you bring those in. Oh, no, no. It's okay. I can handle it. Don't gotta tell me twice. I love not helping. [chuckles] We'll see you tomorrow? Definitely. [door shuts] hope you know what you're doin'. She's coming out of her shell. That's all I wanted. I mean, she's getting really attached. You can see that, right? [engine starts] [instrumental music] [glass shattering] [dog barking] hello? [dog barking] [dramatic music] hello? Anybody there? I know you're there. I'm gonna call the police! [grunting] You bitch! I know it was you! It's just like before! You're ruining my life! And nobody believes me! You brought it upon yourself! For getting even after years of torture? Do your new friends have any idea what you're capable of? You're going to admit to everything you've done, everything, or I swear to God, I will kill you. [groaning] [Sean] Casey! Oh, God. [instrumental music] [Casey gasps] [breathing heavily] okay, let's just, let's just stay calm about this, okay? This was an accident. The police are never gonna-- the police? No. No, that can't happen. I thought of all people, that you would know that. This was self-defense. She was strangling you. Yeah, but what if they ask why she was here in the first place? They'll ask their questions and they'll figure out what actually happened. What do you mean? Are you in trouble again? I did something to her and her friend. If it gets out... People are finally starting to treat me normally and I won't be a freak again because of this. What are you saying? [intense music] [Sean sighs] don't touch that. I'll get rid of it. [music continues] Hailey, I'm so sorry. I know we never quite saw eye-to-eye, but I don't think that means you're a bad person. Your family is worried about you. Your friends at school miss you. I know that running away seeMs like the easiest option, but trust me, it's just gonna hurt more in the long run. Facing the consequences of your actions is scary, but it's even scarier to be out there, all alone. I don't know where I would be without my friends and followers. Thanks for watching. Remember to like and comment, and use the hashtag 'haileycomehome', so she knows how much we all care about her. Until next time! [mellow music] -[all] Whoo! Yeah! -Good work, girls! Let's bring that energy to Friday night's game. What the hell are you so scowly about? Oh. Oh, dude. Come on. How much longer are you gonna milk the whole broken leg thing? So you have to hobble to class. Get over it already. God, you're a bitch. And that's not what I'm upset about. It's this! This travesty. [chuckles] Casey? Come on, Queen Bee, there's enough room in the hive for all of us. For now, maybe. But there can only be one real queen. And if you get in her way... -Good Lord, you're paranoid. -Am I? Don't you find it weird that every time something bad happens, Casey somehow benefits from it? I break my leg, and a spot opens up on the team. Hailey gets expelled and goes missing, and Casey becomes this social-justice warrior with hundreds of followers. What, you can't actually think that Casey is some, what, maniacal sociopath, hell-bent on carnage? She used to see the school counselor for anger issues. Yeah, her dad died in a fire. I think she's entitled to a little rage. This was before then, back when we were friends. Casey was the leader of our clique. And if Hailey and I ever stepped out of line, she'd put us back in our place. [instrumental music] Look, I know this sounds awful, but honestly... She became a better person after the accident. -And I thought I was an ass. -Sorry, but it's true! And now, it's like it's all coming back. You're creating a monster. Fine. Don't believe me. Just let her keep using you to get more popular. And once she's done with you... Maybe you'll disappear, too. Don't say I didn't warn you. If your life starts to inexplicably fall apart... you'll know why. [upbeat music] -Hey, Vance. -Yo, Case. -You look nice today. -Oh, this old thing? [chuckles] So you, uh, going to Reagan's party tonight? Uh, yeah, I practically planned it. Of course you did. Uh, there's something I was actually hoping to ask you. Well, do you wanna just ask me here? No, not here, and definitely not this sober, uh.. See you tonight? Yeah. I'm looking forward to it. Sweet. Gee, whiz, you two actually going out yet? I guess we'll find out tonight. Oh, always nice to see your creepy neighbor at his post. He's not creepy. I actually think he's kind of cute. -[scoffs] -Really? He's got that whole bad-boy thing. Literally. What, you guys don't know? He deals to half the kids at Jefferson. I'm pretty sure he's where Hailey got those pills before she went AWOL. No, I believe it. I'm pretty sure he has a tattoo on his body. Somewhere very unsavory. There is really only one way to find out. Taylor is rubbing off on you. -We'll see you at the game. -Yeah. [instrumental music] Whoo! Go Hornets! [Taylor] Whoo! Been seeing a lot of them Malibu Barbies around here lately. Come on, Casey. You know those aren't our people. We're the poor kids that dream of getting out of the sticks. And girls like that, they only hang out with us out of pity. You don't know what you're talking about. You know I'm right. Do you really think that they care about people like us? They're my friends. Okay. You're right. I'm sorry. Are you all right? I mean, I just feel like we haven't... really been able to talk since... Are you really bringing that up now? Sorry. I just... I just don't like talking about it. It's all behind us, right? It's not like we meant to do it. Hey, why don't you come out with me tonight? There's this party after the football game at Reagan's house. The Barbie driving the car. You really think that's a good idea? Definitely. It'll help get your mind off things. And you can see firsthand, how nice they really are. And you can make sure that I get home safely. [chuckles] There's always an angle with you. I've learned that it is the easiest way to get what I want. And what do you want? All of this. My normal life that was taken from me. Hey, um, meet me in the school parking lot after the game. [door opens] Hello, Mom. [Laura sniffles] -Mom? -[Laura sniffling] -Are you okay? -Of course, honey. -[Casey] Mom? -It's nothing. -What happened? -[Laura sighs] Silly little fight with Harlen. That's all. -Is he drinking again? -Oh, he... he got laid off today. -So he's just upset. -Mom. When are you gonna dump him? We don't need him. [chuckles] I gotta get to work, honey. I'm gonna be late. Do me a favor and just keep it down, okay? 'cause Harlen's sleeping. [intense music] [Casey] Wake up. Wake up. -What the hell? -Careful. I don't have a tight grip, and I'd hate for it to slip. You've worn out your welcome here. Actually, you wore it out a long time ago. I just wasn't in the place to do something about it. You're gonna leave tonight! And if you don't, I'll call the cops, tell them how you treat us, how you hit me when I don't give you what you want. -No one's gonna believe that! -Oh, really? I've seen the way you look at me. You really think they'll believe you over me? [sobbing] Officer, please, I tried to stop him. He said he wanted me. Needed me. What the hell is wrong with you? You know, I guess I'm just fed up with the hand I've been dealt. I'm gonna go to my room now, and when I get back, you're not gonna be here. And if I ever see you near my mom again, I will gut you like a fish.

You said you had something to tell me. Can you hold that? Thanks. [door creaking] Well... This is cozy. So... What's on your mind? I, um... Sorry. I'm not really good at this kind of thing. It's okay. It's just me. Okay. Uh... Here goes. I... Like someone, like, really like them. But I don't really wanna make a move until I know they feel the same way. I understand. But I think I know who you're talking about and I'm pretty sure they feel the same way. -God, is it that obvious? -Kind of. But it's cute. I knew I could count on you. So... You'll talk to her for me? Her? Yeah. Taylor. [intense music] Casey, you okay? Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. I'm just gonna get some fresh air. -[Reagan coughing] -[flushing] -Oh... -[Taylor] Feeling better? Good. Maybe now you'll listen to some reason. -Oh, not this again, Taylor. -Reagan, he is a drug dealer. Okay, isn't there someone else you can be a bad girl with? -What are you, my mom? -Okay, you're drunk and clearly not thinking straight. I mean, why is Casey even friends with him? Isn't that very concerning? [Reagan] What is that supposed to mean? Haven't you been noticing? She's been acting different lately. She's happy. That's a good thing. Sure. Sure. But also kind of manipulative? Uh, did you see that video she posted about Hailey? -They weren't even friends. -That's ridiculous. Maybe. But what if it's not? I talked to Clair. [Reagan] Clair's going to trash-talk Casey. -She hates her. -Haven't you ever wondered why? You know, maybe some of the things she's saying is true. Why lie? Did you know that Casey had to go to counseling for anger issues? I'm just saying, we don't really know her. So why play with fire? You don't have to adopt the stray kid just because you feel sorry for her. I mean, look at some of her posts. She copies everything you do. It's creepy! This is insane! -[Taylor sighs] -I'm going to find Sean. [Taylor] Reagan. Reagan, wait! Reagan!

What are you talking about? The video of me and Sean! So many people have seen this. I swear, I have no idea what you're talking about. Oh, my God. [intense music] What... I, I didn't post that. Well, according to this, you did. Why would I do something like that? I mean, you can't honestly think that I would... Look, I don't even have my phone! I-I lost it last night! You're such a liar! It's literally right there! [music continues] This, this doesn't make any sense. The last time I had it, we were in the bathroom and... and I went chasing after Reagan, and you were there. -[Casey] What are you saying? -Taylor. Are you seriously trying to blame this on Casey? -I didn't do anything. -I know you didn't. How could you do this to me? Oh, my God. Clair was right. Why? Wh-what did I even do to you? Enough. You need to leave now. No, I'm not leaving you here with this psycho! Taylor, go home! You really think I did this. Casey, what am I gonna do? I can't go back to school on Monday. Everyone has seen this. Hey, it's gonna be okay. I know exactly what you're feeling, remember? Stay home for the rest of the week. I'll lead cheer practice and get your homework, and by Friday, there'll be a whole new scandal. Everybody will have forgotten. Oh, God! I'm gonna be labeled a slut. And we didn't even do anything aside from make out. Really? He said I was too drunk. We must've stopped just after that video ended. I don't think this is just gonna blow over, Case. I promise you it will. And besides, I am gonna need you there for the big announcement for Most Inspirational Student. You really think it'll be okay? I really do. If anyone tries to mess with you, they're gonna have to get through me. Okay? I got your back. [cell phone ringing] Hey, Mom. Hey, honey, I'm just, uh, checking in, making sure you're safe. Yeah, I'm fine. I ended up spending the night at Reagan's. Oh, that's fine, just, uh, let me, let me know next time, okay? -Fine. -Honey, did you, um... did you see Harlen before you left last night because, uh, he hasn't come home and, uh, I've been calling his cell, but he's, he's not answering, so... -Mom, Harlen left. -What? He bailed, and he said he wasn't coming back. -And I say, good riddance! -W-w-what do you mean? -He-he left? -Why are you so surprised? He was a jerk, Mom, and it's not like he's the first guy to let us down. Did you say something to him? -Are you serious? -I'm s... It's just... [Casey on phone] this is our chance to be happy. We could finally be a normal family. Don't you want that? It's gonna be okay, Mom, I promise. -Hey, Vance. -Hey, Casey. -How you doin'? -I'm fine. It's just, you think you know someone... You know, how could Taylor post that video? Crazy. I just feel kind of stupid for crushing on her. I feel the same way. I mean, what kind of a person does something like that? You wouldn't. You're a good person, Casey. It's obvious why you were nominated for the inspiration award. I announce the winner on the air. I'm really hoping it's you. [instrumental music] ♪ W-I-N Go... ♪ ♪ W-I-N Go... ♪ ♪ W-I-N Go... ♪ [cheering] [man on PA] students of Jefferson High, don't forget, today is the last day to vote for the Most Inspirational Student Award. You must be pleased with yourself. Sweetie, I'm sure I have no idea what you're talking about. No? Everybody pretty much hates me. And they seem to love you even more. Even Reagan was taken down a few pegs, leaving room on top for you. Taylor, if you don't like the consequences of your actions, maybe you should rethink them. Oh, you are such a delusional bitch! Okay, am I really supposed to think that all of this was just a coincidence? I don't care what you think. [Taylor] I know you posted the video from my phone. Probably did all the other stuff Clair told me about, too. Don't know why, besides the fact that you are bat-... crazy. But I will prove it. Are you really sure that's a good idea, after all that's happened? -Are you threatening me? -No. I'm merely pointing out that others have tried to take me down, and it's never ended well for them. I don't know, maybe the universe is finally on my side and karma's a bitch. [intense music] [Reagan] Thanks for getting all my assignments for me. I don't know what I would do without you. Well, anything for you. You really did not miss much this week. Are people still talking about it? It's a distant memory. Trust me. I handled it. Nervous for the results tomorrow? A little, but I'm feeling confident. Please. You're a shoe-in. [door opens] [Casey sighs] -Hey, Mom. -Hi, honey. -Are you okay? -Oh, yeah. Just these double shifts aren't as easy as they used to be. Oh, which reminds me, can-can you get a ride in the morning? -I have to open tomorrow, so... -Yeah, that's fine. Oh, and, honey, um, a package came for you. -I put it in your room. -Finally! Uh, it came at the perfect time. -[Laura] Honey. -Hm? You know that you can talk to me, right? Really, whatever it is, I'm-I'm here, okay? If there's something that, that you need to tell me, I... Mom. I'm fine. Like, for the first time in a long while... You don't have to worry about me. Really, I promise. Okay. I just, uh... I love you so much. [instrumental music] I love you, too. [instrumental music] [intense music] Jefferson High, I give you this year's 'Most Inspirational.' Thank you. Thank you. [door creaks] [intense music] [keys jingling] Holy hell! [siren blaring] [intense music] [music continues] [instrumental music] [Casey] Hey, can you give me a ride to school? Sean? What the hell, Sean? I was just about to come get you. -We have to go. Now. -What are you talking about? Hey, Sean. Talk to me. What's going on? [sighs] -They found her body. -Hailey's? They dug her up a few days ago, it didn't take long for her parents to identify her. Okay, let's think about this, so... They don't actually have anything linking us to her. [dramatic music] Why do you still have it? I was gonna sell it. Look, she was your friend. Okay, that's gonna lead them here. So if we don't leave now-- No, I can't leave. My whole life is here. You know how crazy that sounds, right? You killed her. You won't have a life if you stay here. Hey. Hey. Look, it's gonna be all right. Okay? We can build a whole new life together. I mean, come on, this is what we always used to talk about. The two of us, leaving this place behind. Why do you think I came back here? You are the only one that's ever understood me. And you know I'd do anything for you. So what are we waiting for? This won't just go away. You're right. I know you're right. [dramatic music] [gunshot] [door opens] [breathing heavily] [screams] [sobbing] [breathing heavily] [woman] 911. What's your emergency? [sobbing] Please, I need the police, I... I think someone's been shot. The yellow house on Sterling Lane. [intense music] [engine starts] Hey, Casey, it's Reagan. I just wanted to see if you're here yet. Um, hey! It's good to see you back. What do you want, Taylor? Okay, you're still mad, that's fine, we, we don't have to talk. But there is something you have to see. What is it? -Casey's student records. -What? Are you serious? I know, I know. "God, I'm the worst," and so on. Look, can we just skip all of that, Reagan, because there's some crazy stuff in there. Police records, psych evaluations. Things that raise some really big questions. I'm not gonna dig through her personal history. -It isn't right. -"Isn't right?" Reagan, she is playing you! She's playing all of us! Just see for yourself. Look, if there's any part of you that believes that I would never betray you like that, just do me this favor. Okay, if you don't change your mind after that, then I promise I won't bother you ever again. [mellow music] [cell phone chimes] Casey, where have you been? You okay? Yeah, yeah, just a little nervous, I guess. Well, don't be. The votes are in. -Casey, you won. -Really? They voted for me? Of course. It wasn't even close. Come on. They asked me to bring you back for the big announcement. [Reagan] Casey? You came! Hey, do you have a second? -I was hoping we could talk. -Can it wait? I really have to get ready. I have to look the part. I promise it won't take long. Okay. Gotta be ready here, guys. [intense music] [door creaks] I'm glad you decided to come today. So... What's up? Where did you get this? Taylor. She kind of stole it from the counselor's office. There's a police report in there and the things it says... Casey, I know you've been through a lot, but I need you to be honest with me. It says you were the main suspect in the fire. It says they had evidence, until, inexplicably, Sean confessed and then fled the state. -Shut up. -Casey, talk to me! -What really happened? -I said shut up! What happened to your house, to your dad, was it an accident? I'm sure there's an explanation-- He deserved it! The way that he treated us... He would drink, he'd get angry and he would hit me, my mom. And we just lived with it for years. And I took my anger out on my friends. Oh, my God. Casey. Until I had enough. One night when he was passed out from too much drinking... I don't regret starting the fire. I am glad that he's dead. The only thing I regret is what happened to me! And when I met you, things finally started looking up again, but people just kept getting in the way! So it was really you? Everything that happened? The video? It wasn't Taylor? She wouldn't keep her mouth shut just like Clair... and Hailey. Casey, please. You need help. Taylor and Clair will forgive you, I know it. And when Hailey comes home-- Hailey's not coming home. What? Oh, no, Casey, no. Please don't tell me-- I-I-I didn't mean to. It just happened. But it's okay, the police are on their way to Sean's house right now and they're gonna find Hailey's necklace on his body, and he's gonna take the fall for me, just like he did before. His body? My God, Casey, how many people have you hurt? Enough. Enough to keep them from taking what's mine, what I worked so hard to get. We're gonna get you help. I promise. No, we're not. [Reagan groans] [intense music] [Casey] I don't wanna hurt you, Reagan, but... if you do say something, I can't be held accountable for my actions. You'll just be another tragic teen suicide. Jealous that her new best friend eclipsed her in popularity. Reagan, you are my best friend. So I need you to be a good friend and not say anything. -[Vance] Casey, you in here? -Yeah, I'm just getting dressed. [Vance] Okay. We'll need you in two minutes. Okay, thanks, Vance! You got it. I better go get ready. It'll give you some time to think. And once all of this is over, it'll be like none of this ever happened. No one would believe you anyway. [intense music] [door opens] [door shuts] [Vance] It's with great pleasure I introduce this year's winner. Jefferson High, say hello to the most inspirational student of the year, Casey Paulson. [applauding] [cheering] [Casey] Thank you so much. You have no idea how much this means to me. You know, if you'd told me a month ago that I would be standing here, I'd... I would have thought you were crazy. I was an outsider. I was a freak. Or so I thought. When all of you saw me for who I really was, you accepted me. For the first time in a really long while... I felt like I belonged. I know it's been a really long road to get here. But I promise you, now that I am here, I am not going anywhere. I will do the title 'Most Inspirational' proud. [Casey on video] I don't regret starting the fire. I am that glad he's dead. The only thing I regret... [Casey] No. [Casey on video] ...Is what happened to me! [Casey] Stop it. [Reagan on video] My God, Casey, how many people have you hurt? [Casey on video] Enough. Enough to keep them from taking what's mine! [gasps] No. No. [Casey on video] You'll just be another tragic teen suicide. -There she is. -[indistinct radio chatter] [Casey] No. No. You can't take this away from me. No, I deserve this. I deserve this! [screaming] No! I deserve this! [indistinct radio chatter] I just, I wanna thank you for stopping by as often as you do. I mean, it's, it's nice to see a familiar face. I'm happy to, Ms. Paulson. I, uh, I hear what people are saying. The things that-that Casey did. I know that she confessed. How can my sweet girl be capable of all that? [mellow music] She's gonna get better. -Right? -Of course, she is. [intense music] [knocking on door] [man] You got a new roommate. [girl] Hi, I'm new here. I don't really know anyone yet. Do you wanna be friends? Hi. I'm Casey. [dramatic music]
