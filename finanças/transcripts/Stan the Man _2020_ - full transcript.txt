Candy, Mandy, get up. Rise and shine, it's a beautiful day. Oh, I'm hungry. What's for breakfast? Don't worry, I'll have the chef make us something great to eat. Oh, can we have those mimosas again? Yeah. Of course, whatever make you ladies happy. Come on, let's go. Oh Mom, Pop; what a beautiful bride you were. Thank you, Darlings, for a wonderful evening. It was sure double the fun, with you two, queen beauties. You're so welcome, Stan. You're the man, Stan. Good morning, Mr. Mann. I trust that you slept well last night. Are you kidding? With these two lovely creatures, there was no time for sleep. Should you need another room for any of your overnight guests this week, we will certainly set something aside. Just let us know. Have a great day, Mr. Mann. Thank you. I do hope you enjoyed, the dinner I made for you last evening. I figured since you had such, such lovely guests, I'd go ahead and make my Oyster Mignonette, huh? Wasn't it girls? Oh, that was so yummy, Chef. I liked the mimosas best. Kon'nichiwa. Right this way, Mr. Mann, your chauffeur is waiting for you, right this way. We reserved this date just for you, and you've never told us anything about a meeting. Yes, Stan, you cheeky, little devil you. I can... It's no problem at all. We can just tag along, wait in the car. Yeah. Until your meeting is over, and then continue the fun. Yeah. I'm sorry, Double Delights, I gotta go. I gotta go. No. Stan, remember what you promised us. We're your stand in Wednesday appointment. Remember you said, no matter what else you do that day, you would do us on Wednesday too. Good morning, sir. Is everything all right? It sure is. Life is good, Joey. Did you take care of that bank withdrawal for me? I sure did. Where too, sir? Let's go visit my Gallery Manager, Melody Dubois. Some name, huh? Sounds French. Parle de Francais No sorry, Sir. I don't speak French. Neither do I. Come on, let's go. We will have this shipped to you, right away. Okay? - Sure. - Thanks so much for coming today. Thank you. Bye. Hi, may I help you with something? I am Elizabeth Morgan. And my very dearest friend is Mr. Mann. And I think he forgot to tell me that he hired somebody. I had a few people in mind for him, myself. In fact, I'm the person who told him to diversify his portfolio and buy this art gallery. What did you say your name was? Oh, I'm Melody Dubois. And how did you meet Mr. Mann? I was re, recommended to Mr. Mann by a mutual friend at The Sorbonne In Manhattan? No, no. The, the. The Sorbonne, in, in Paris, I, I got my training there as well. Oh, I see. Well, most of my friends are patrons of New York's finest art galleries. Do you get to New York much, Melody? Actually, yes I do. Yes, of course you do. Well then, Melody, I've been looking at these two paintings and I was wondering what you thought? I, I think they're both excellent choices. Well, in that case, I'll take that one. Ah, Elizabeth, looking beautiful as ever. Hello, Melody. How are you? Good morning. Good morning. I'm very well, Sir. Good morning, Stanley. How are you today? Life is good. Mm. I see you've already met my, Gallery Manager, Melody. Since she's been with me, you know, my sales have doubled, isn't that right, Melody? Sir. That's correct. I, I've had the opportunity to work with the best in the business, you know, the art community is a very small intimate place. And even though I've worked all around the world, I am thrilled to be back here in the US, working for you at Mankind Gallery. Would you be a dear, Melody and wrap my paintings for me, please? Of course, of course. Excuse me. So, what have you decided to buy today? Oh, I had my eye on these two abstracts and then I couldn't decide. I was very worried about my brow line. So I, decided on that one. This one. Excellent, excellent choice. Are you gonna ask for the discount? Oh, Stanley. Our friendship is discount enough. Mm-hmm. In fact, have you thought more about what I offered you the last time we were together? Mm. Oh, I thought about it, all right. Mm. And you know. Marriage is not for me. I have a very important meeting that I need to get to. So, Melody? Yes, Sir? Can you please take special care of my generous patron, Ms. Morgan? For me. Of course, Sir. Absolutely. Oh, Stanley, could I talk to you for a moment, while you're lovely assistant is wrapping my painting. It'll only be a moment. Sure. Yeah. Stanley. I have tried, for nearly 10 years to get you to change your life, to change your ways, you need to be with a woman who's going to love you. Liz, Liz, Liz. How many times must I tell you? It's not in the cards for me. I love you, Stanley. You are my soulmate. You are my one true love. I've survived all these loveless marriages, which have given me status, and wealth, and all the material things I thought would make me happy. And those things do make me happy to a certain extent. In fact, I couldn't even imagine what my life would be like, without my homes in London, and Paris, and New York. And oh, my favorite, the Italian Alps. But Stanley, I've come to realize, that with you in my life, as my husband, our life could be perfect. God knows, I don't wanna upset you, Liz. I just don't wanna be married. Not to you or any woman. A soulmate, it's not for me. Can't we still be friends? No. Stanley, no. Your friends with benefits days are over with me. Do you hear me? That is it. I am done, with you. Thank you. And for you. - Thank you, very much. - Thank you, so much. I don't have any small bills on me to tip you. What do you... You don't have anything on you? No. Ah, It's on the house. Well, come, come back and I'll, I'll definitely take care of you. Okay, we'll get you next time. Dude, did you see the fight the other night? Knock out, on the first round. Hey, you hear me, Bro? What? No, I didn't. No, I didn't see the fight. But listen, I don't know about my girlfriend, Alex. I give that chick everything, you know, I never wanted her to take the job in that liquor store. My girlfriend working in a dump like that, was embarrassing. Yeah. I always thought that, but, you know, who am I to question it? You never really let on, that it embarrassed you though. Are you too good now, or what? Do you have any idea, all the action I could get, if I wanted it? Let's just say, opportunities have been presented, not to mention, what happens when I'm traveling on business. Yeah, I can imagine, Bro. I've been thinking about breaking up with Kristi for a long time, now. You know, Kristi's always been a little high strung. She's a nervous wreck these days. Where is this headed with Kristi? I figured, after she becomes an RN, I'll talk to her, tell her like it is, but it is taking her, so long, to finish Nursing School. Hey, is that Kristi over there? Are you supposed to be meeting her or something? No. But maybe it's a good thing she showed up here. I can talk to her right now about an idea I just had. Thanks man. You've inspired me. I got a way for her to finish Nursing School early. Hey Babe. What you doing here? Hey, I didn't realize you're coming back into Town so early. You, looking for me? No, I was just coming to lay by the pool, and get the sun, and relax. Could we. Let's, let's talk for a second. I know how hard it's been for you to juggle a job with your studies. I know how much you want to begin your nursing career. Yeah, I can't wait to become a nurse. Look, my place is big and I'm out of town a lot, for business. Yeah? So why don't you give up your place; save that rent money and move into my penthouse? I'll take care of everything for you, until you become an RN. How's that sound? Big step, moving in together. You really think we'd get along, I mean, you are kind of set in your ways and stuff. I just don't get, how you could turn down an offer like this? I mean, my place is unreal, isn't it? It's in the most awesome building in the city. Mm. The only penthouse in the building and the only unit with an outdoor terrace roof garden. Ah, what else could you possibly want? Let's face it, on a nurse's salary, you'd never be able to afford to live in a place like mine. Oh geez, when you bring it up like that Coop. Let's go grab a bite. I'm hungry. Let's celebrate. Yeah. Okay. I can. Yeah, I can relax another day, you know. Come on. Good girl. That's a good girl. Ah, you is a good girl. That's a beautiful dog. German Shepherd, right? "Rin Tin Tin", I love that breed. I see the pink collar. What's her name? Her name is Princess. She's a service dog, the VA gave me to help me with my PTSD. Ah, military. Yes, Sir. What'd you serve? What branch? United States Marine Corps. Battalion Recon Afghanistan, Sir. Thank you for your services, Marine. I just did my part. I did three tours back-to-back and just haven't quite been the same since I came home. I've seen too much over there. I can, I could only imagine. I don't know what would've happened to me by now, if not for my Princess. Well, open your hand here. Here's a little something for you and your Princess. Oh. - Thank you very much. - God bless you, Sir. God bless you. Thank you. Look. Hey Hey. - Hey. - Danny. How you doing? How's the family? Stan, everyone's good, they're good. Man, I was hoping I would catch you here. Do you, can you spare a minute? I'll give you two minutes. Okay, cool man. Yeah, you know, I just really wanted to thank you again. I dunno what I would've done after I got laid off, without you, and your help, and, you know, just like, thank you for helping my wife, and my kids, and my family, and you know your generosity, but mostly really importantly your, your friendship. It really means everything to me, you know, you had my back, when I needed it most, and I want you to know, I take nothing for granted, Man. God bless you, Stan. Ah, Danny boy, Danny boy, is this going where I think it's going. You gonna ask me for another loan, huh? 'Cause, you owe me a lot. I'm starting to think, lending you all this money, is hurting you, more than helping you. I mean, yeah, but I don't know what I would've done if it weren't for you. I mean, keeping the roof over my family's head and food on the table. Listen to Stan. I feel lucky right, okay. Something's changed, and I, I. I'm onto something. I, I can't explain it, but I am. You really think you're gonna beat the house? I will, you know I swear to God. I swear on my kids. Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey don't go swearing on your kids. God doesn't like that kind of talk. Listen, Look, I want them to be proud of their mommy and daddy. Ah. That's a beautiful family. Yeah, we're dreaming big, so they can have a better life than, than we have you. You know what I mean? As long, as you're taking care of your family, I don't, I don't mind helping you. Come on. Let's just drink to you two beautiful sisters, Cherri And Sherri. Mm. This is so nice, Stan. We're so happy you called us. We had so much fun last time, remember. Of course, ladies, I want you on my arms every day and in my bed every night. But you know, you know, seeing Joey in his home, you know, with his wife and son, you know, it made me think. But I'm over it now. Listen, bring me your best red wine. Nothing but the best for my ladies here. And the Filet Mignon. The chef knows, just how I like it prepared. Oh, and make sure you tell that hoke of a host out there, that we're not to be disturbed. You got that? Hello? Good evening, ladies. Table for two I presume? Ah, no, no, no. We're here to meet someone. - Who are you here to meet? - Mr. Stan Mann. I'm very sorry ladies. Mr. Mann is unavailable this evening. Unavailable? So Stan is in there. Who's he with? Nevermind asking him anything, let's go. Well, well, well. Look what we have here, Sister. Listen, Ladies. Listen, some misunderstanding, okay. That's all it is. Just take it easy. I'm sure we'll work out all the problems to make everybody happy. You know, it's always best to stay in the solution. Ah-huh, misunderstanding. I don't think so, Stan. Stay in the solution? - Yeah. - What's up with you, Stan? What, you got a twin fetish. Who the hell are you, two? Who cares who they are? Cherri. Ah-uh, you two skanks need to piss off, this is our meeting with Stan. So, you guys need to get out. Don't touch my sister I gotta get away from these ladies. They're batshit crazy. Can you get me somewhere, where I can wait out this twin storm? Of course, Sir. Right this way, The bathroom? I've got two Super Bowl rings. Mm-hmm, really? These ladies won't get by me, Sir. Oh yeah? Then how did these wackadoos, get to my table in the first place? Oh God, why did I think dating twins was such a good idea? Hi, Sir, may I interest you in a cigar? Well, how are you doing, Sweet Cheeks? What you got there? We have the finest cigar available anywhere in the world, Sir. What do you suggest?

I never thought my luck would ever run out. I've been lucky my entire life. I guess my luck finally ran out. What these Russians told me sounded so easy.

I don't know what I'm gonna do. We're gonna talk, you and me. What's going on. This is my last chance to get my flipping wings. All right, Pal. So let's get this thing going. How did you get in here? How did I get in here? Stanley. Those are a lot of really good questions, but I don't have a lot of time, kay. And it's a long story. So start talking, Missy. Right, ahem. Now, listen up, I am trying to get you your second chance here. Now where I come from let's just say, it takes a lot of work to get yourself eternally situated. Get my drift? So, I got assigned to you. Assigned to me? All's I know, is you went into a liquor store to try to drown your sorrows. But instead, you took a bullet for some girl you don't even know, mm. So, on account of a very nice lady, who keeps bragging about how brave you are, your case came up. I got assigned to it. And now here I am trying to earn my flipping wings. Oh my God. What's with all this frigging white light? It's starting to give me a headache. You're in between two worlds, Stanley. I'm in purgatory? And I gotta pay for my sins, before God lets me into heaven? I'm not dead yet, right? Well technically, officially you're not dead. But one thing you gotta know. If you go back, I can only give you 30 days to change your ways. You gotta find your soulmate. Your one true love. And look, I know this really sounds sappy, but it's my last chance too, so, let's just do this thing all right, Stanley. God, this is a nightmare. Please. Somebody wake me up. Stanley. Shut the hell up. Hey, you're an angel. Watch your language. Have you ever watched the lights flickering? Yeah, that's Natalie. She has tried every way possible to get you to pay attention to her messages. She wants you to realize that the life you're living well, it's just not good enough. So I have one more assignment to earn my wings. Whoa Let's go. Okay. Look, ahem, if I send you back, you gotta stop; gambling, drinking and womanizing, understand? Understand who could understand this? Ah, this is Niki's doing. Ah, Niki! This is a prank. He loves to get me going. Niki, come on out. It's no joke. It's no prank. You get a do-over. You get to get outta this hospital and you've got 30 days to change your ways, deal? I've never fall in love in my life. I've never fell in love in my whole life. How am I gonna find love in a month? Don't screw it up for me. Even if you don't care about a second chance for you. Oh, one more thing, remember the Russians and what happened to all of your money? Yeah. Yeah. If you go back, it'll be without your wealth, you gotta find true love without the temptations of money. And I don't mean to rush you, but the clock is ticking, so. So, Stanley, do you wanna go back and take this second chance? You're gonna go back or are you gonna go on? And, and, and like, I said, like, a zillion times, like, I have to know now, because well, it's my last shot too. Oh my God. Oh my God. Stanley. What happened to him? Who's in charge here. What, what, what, what happened? - You're speaking. - What, what, what? - Oh, thank God. - She looks familiar. - Oh God Stanley. - Was it, was it a dream, or was it an Angel? I have been frantic with worry. Your chauffeur called me and told me you'd been at a terrible car accident. What happened? Did you total the Bentley? Ahem. Are you okay? I mean, do you have any broken bones Ah nothing on your face? There's not gonna be any scarring. Oh, thank God. Oh, Stanley. You're alive. Oh, thank God. Be careful Liz, man, it hurt me. Okay. - Hello? - Oh Hi. I'm Dr. Hart. The Treating Physician here in the Emergency Department. Uh, Mrs. Mann, your husband is quite lucky. The bullet missed his vital organs and passed right through his shoulder. He has lost a lot of blood, but I believe he will recover nicely. What is to become of my husband? How long is he gonna be here in the hospital? Now I wanna make sure he's very comfortable. Maybe he should have a suite. Something very nice. I will pay for it. Only the best for my love Now, Mrs. Mann, let's not get ahead of ourselves. Mr. Mann will have to remain here in ER, until we stabilize him. The bullet did do some damage as it passed through your husband is very lucky to survive the shooting. Bullet? The shooting? Oh no doctor, I think you have my Stanley confused with somebody else in your hospital. You really should check your booklet there. My Stanley was in an auto accident. My, my Doctor Hart. This is quite disconcerting that you would confuse, my love for somebody else in your hospital. No, Mrs. Mann. Your husband Stanley, sustained a serious wound from a gunshot. And as soon as we stabilize him here, I will have him admitted to our Intensive Care Unit upstairs. And all of our rooms in ICU are the same. A gunshot, oh my God. Hey doc, did I get shot? Where's Joey. He's gotta know what happened. Forget about that chauffeur of yours, okay. You're with him and somehow you get shot, Honey. Please, don't worry about a thing. I'm here now and I'm gonna take care of everything. You just need to rest. Rest. Okay? Mrs. Mann. I will check in on your husband again shortly. Ah nurse. Please see that Mr. Mann's visitors are restricted to family. Of course Doctor. Liz. - Hmm? - Come, come here. Closer. Yes, honey. Oh. Can I ask you a question? Mm-hmm. Are we married? Uh, no, we're not married. Huh. Not yet, but soon, My Love. Very, very soon. Stan. Open your eyes, Stan. It's Kristy. How you feeling? I feel better now. Who likes being here really? Look at this delicious soup, chunks of chicken, and carrot, and noodles. Is it hot? No, it's not hot. Some broth. Ah. What? Oh man. No, this is good stuff. - It's horrible. - There's spices. I'm sure somebody's grandmother made this. I can't believe you're insulting it like that it's so yummy. You gonna keep making me eat this? Here we go. That's right. There you go. Oh my goodness. You're a mess. It's too. It's too salty. It's not too salty It's high sodium. Just eat. Oh God. Open. Mm. Check. You're kidding, right? Yeah, it just went right by. No it didn't. Yeah, it did. - Not in a hospital. - It did. You're kidding. Would I, kid you? Ooh check. Nice. - Take that. - Which one you want. Take that. No. I brought this book for you to make you feel better about healing, feeling good and strong. You did that for me? I did. I did that for you. Now listen to this quote. This is a quote by James Allen. Do you know who he is? No. Me neither. "Mind is the master power that molds and makes, and man is mind, and evermore he takes." Jesus Christ. Stan are you all right? I just got the call from Joseph. I ran right over here. What the hell happened? Ah, it's a long story, Niki. I'm still a little foggy on the details. Ah, doc said I'm a lucky son of a bitch, but, hey, we know that already, right? There you go again with that luck, You're always bringing up. How did this happen? You were shot. Are you in pain? How, how long have you gonna be in this hospital? Well, I'm not sure. Probably just a couple more days. Listen, Nick, I gotta ask you something. - Yeah? - Come here. Do you, do you believe in Angels? Did you ever experience any, anything like someone appearing to you like in a dream? No. I can't say that's ever happened to me. Why? Is that what happened to you? Yeah, when I was in the ER, I had flashes of a memory where I was talking to an Angel. She said her name was Angelina. An angel named Angelina, go on. She knew a lot about me, especially how I've been living my life. I was just about to kick the bucket. When she told me about a Natalie. Weird, right? While you were unconscious, you had a dream about an angel, who knew your mother and told you, you weren't gonna die from this gunshot. Is that about right, Pal? In order to get a second chance, I have to change my ways. Your ways, like that gambling, you always tell me you're gonna stop. And my lady friends too, what's going on, Niki? Was it a dream or was it really an Angel, sent by my mom? Now that I think about it, I did read in a magazine about people who have near death experiences. I think that's what may have happened to you. You think, So? I mean, it said they see and hear things that seem to be real, but it's just your brain playing tricks on you, but I'll tell you what's so strange is that your mother's name was mentioned. And besides me, nobody else knows your family background. Man, I must be losing my mind. It must be playing tricks on me. I don't know, Buddy. That's weird. But Stan, I gotta take off now. I'm here for you. So call me if you need anything. - Thanks Nick. - All right. Kiss the kids for me, all right. - I will. - I'll see ya. So what's going on with you and Cooper? He asked me to move in with him. - Really? - Mm-hmm. That's so exciting. Oh my gosh. Mm-hmm. Okay, so you know, now we're gonna have to do, like, dates together, and like, game nights, and go on vacation together. Oh Lisa, we just moving in together, we're not getting married. Well, why do you have to say it like that? I mean, you do want to Marry Cooper, right? Yeah. I wanna get married. I just... More importantly to the right person. Yeah. I spent a lot of time in the hospital with Stan. And It just kinda got me thinking. Wait, what's going on with this guy, Stan? I mean, I get it. He saved your life and everything, but, is it really just a friendship? Yes, just friendship. Really? Yes, really? Okay. I just, um. He saved my life. I get it. It was traumatic, I know, it was a traumatic experience and all of that, but. But, what? You and Cooper have been together for five years, and he loves you. You know that. So I just. I just think you should give it a chance. Just, just see how it goes. Yeah? Okay. Okay. I'm gonna do this. So cheers. Cheers. To new beginnings. To new beginnings. Yes. I'm gonna button you up and we are gonna get you home. You're gonna be so comfortable and oh my goodness. I just love this shirt on you. It is so handsome. You know what I was thinking? I was thinking you should come home with me and my staff would take amazing care of you and I could give you all the TLC you should need. What do you think Stanley? I, I don't know about that, Liz. I, I, I. I think it's better off, that I go back to the hotel, I'll be more comfortable. All right, Stanley. Okay. We will do that. Hey Stan. So I found out you're getting discharged today, so I baked some muffins for you to... Take. Ah, um hi, Kristi. Uh, um may I introduce you to um, Elizabeth. Elizabeth, Kristi. Hi. Hi, nice to meet you Anyway. So I just wanted to bring you some muffins and tell you how much I appreciate what you did for me. And I don't know how I could ever repay you. Oh, muffins, how sweet. - Oh. - But if those aren't gluten free, my Stanley certainly couldn't eat them. Oh, oh I'm sorry. I didn't know that. I guess there's a lot of things I don't know about you. Other than, he's my hero. Well, come on, Stanley. Joseph is waiting downstairs. Bye Kristi. And thanks for the goodies. Yeah, you know, if there's ever anything I can do for you, you let me know. I'd love to, give you a call and check in, see how you're healing. Oh, that won't be necessary, Sweetie. My Stanley's gonna be just fine. Won't you, Stanley? You're gonna be in very good hands. Mine. Come on, Stanley. Let's go. I like gluten. Be careful. Let me get you over to the bed and get you comfortable. Let's sit down. There you go. That's good, my love. Now I'm gonna get you something to eat. I'm not hungry, Liz. I'm not hungry. And I don't want to bother you. I know how busy you are. Well, I do have an international conference call in about an hour. So I guess I'll go. Goodbye, my love. Oh. Hello Joseph. - Hello. - I need to run now, but make sure that you call me if my Stanley should need anything at all. I'll keep a close watch on him. Don't you worry? Bye, my love. Oh, it's Irving, he wants me to call him back. I'll just go see him tomorrow. All right, nevermind that. All right, listen to me. What am I gonna do now that I lost everything. This is my fault. I didn't like the looks of those Russians, but I didn't wanna overstep my boundary. Stop Joey. There was nothing you could have done. It's me. I did this, greed. Greed and vodka. I just wish I could have done something. Hear me out. All I could do now is pick up the pieces and move forward. I took a bullet for that girl in the liquor store and maybe that good deed is giving me another chance. All I gotta do now is figure out how I make my money back. Maybe, maybe I take Liz on her offer. Marrying. Miss Elizabeth might be a good solution. I can't tell you what this means to me. I know Ace is gonna be in good hands with you. I only give you my word I will treat him mighty kindly. Ace is gonna miss you, but everybody on the ranch just loves that boy. And then we're gonna give him a whole lot of attention. Actually, you know, he's got his eye on that filly in the next stall. And her trainer, she gives him treats everyday. Yeah, I never thought it ever end up like this. Yeah. I remember when he was born right here on the ranch, damnedest foal, I've ever seen, you know, he was up and nursing like in five seconds. He never wobbled a step. Boy had a set of legs on him. I'm just gonna say my goodbyes now, to my buddy, Ace. And I'm gonna head on out. Yeah. Appreciate everything you've done. Yeah. I'm real sorry, Man. Thank you. Oh, Ace. I messed up and now I gotta do what's right. We've rode out so many times, Ace. And yet, once we rode off together, with all that on my mind, I never had a care in the world. It's a priceless gift, you gave me Ace. The old timer is gonna take good care of you. I promise you I'll be back for you. Okay. Be a good boy, alright, Kristi? Stan. Hi. How are you doing? What are you doing here? I live at the Five Seasons Hotel. This is where I get my coffee every day. I've been coming here for years. Really? So what brings you to this part of Town? Oh, well Cooper lives across the street, so. Oh, I guess we're neighbors now. Yeah. You could say that. Wanna walk with me? I'd love to. So tell me like, what happened when you left? How you feeling? How's it healing? Yeah. You know, it's feeling, it feels like it feels a lot better. - Good. - Like, I'm going to be okay. Good. So ah, how's it living with Coop? It's good, you know, I mean I uh. I'm finishing Nursing School sooner than I thought, so. Yeah, that's good. But, this is me. Ah, it's some car you got there. Oh, well it's not mine, it's Coopers. I'm picking him up tonight, he likes me to pick him up from the airport in it. So. It was good to see you. It was great to see you. Hey, do you like Italian food? I love it. - Can I treat you to lunch? - Yes. Okay. How about right now? Let's do it. Palumbo's they have like the best, best, best, pizza and pasta and crab legs. You know this place, Palumbo's reminds me of a restaurant my mom used to take me to when I was a kid. Kristi, I have to ask you something. Do you believe in Angels? When I was little, we went to go see my grandma in the ICU before she passed. And the whole family gathered around her to say our goodbyes. And when it came my turn, she pulled me really tight to her, and she said, "Nana will always be with you, in spirit, she will always be by your side. Don't you ever forget that." And then she passed And all of a sudden I heard this clicking sound and I couldn't figure out what it was. And I turned and out the window was this big white butterfly, just trying to get inside. And we were on the 18th floor. And to this day, every time I see a butterfly, I think it's my Nana. My mom died when I was a little kid and my dad passed before her. I had no brothers, no sisters it was just me and my mom. She was so beautiful. Everybody loved her. And her food, her cooking, oh. Damn, it was the best. You know, sometimes I can't sleep. I lay awake at night and I wonder what could have happened to me, if fate hadn't brought you into that store, that exact moment, I mean, something led you to me. How else can it be explained, that you entered that particular parking lot, that exact same day? Well, whatever it was, God, fate an Angel. I am so happy that we met.

Do you know what's going on? Do you know, I received a credit card bill today. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah About that, I can explain. You see. I was. I was gambling and. $5 Million, Stanley from Casino Moscow. What the hell's that about? I know. I know. I know. Look, I screwed up. And you know, I don't have a problem. You know. I've been on such a hot streak. I just got drunk, Irv what can I do? What do you mean? What do you do? You pay. You have 30 days to pay that credit card bill. 30 days, Stanley. 30 days. I can't pay $5 million in 30 days, Irv, I mean, you gotta help me. You've gotta make some major changes here or you gonna be broke. You're gonna have to shut down this art gallery, Stanley.

And I mean that, for everything, I will make this right. You have reached the voice mailbox of, Kristi. Hey Kristi, it's Stan. I had a great time yesterday and I just wanted to say how happy I am that you're in my life. But listen, A lot has been going on right now. And can we meet tomorrow and talk? It's really important. Thanks. Hey Liz, I think it's time we go to the next step. Let me pack and I'll be over soon. Oh Stanley. There you are. You're home. Is that all you brought? Okay, it doesn't matter. We'll go shopping for whatever it is that you need. Now, Stanley, I have a very important matter to discuss with you. What's on your mind, Liz? Well, you know, how appearances are very important in my circles, our circles. And I want our wedding to be very classy and very dignified. And normally I wouldn't choose to wear a traditional wedding gown, but I found one that I absolutely love. It's tres chic. Wedding gown. Are, are you kidding me? No, I'm not kidding, Stanley. Brides wear wedding gowns and the grooms wear the tuxes That's what brides and grooms wear, you know. Why do we have to do such an elaborate event? You been married before, a couple of times, right? And me, I can't even believe I'm gonna be giving up my bachelorhood and I certainly don't wanna be wearing some monkey suit. Look, let's be logical about this. We fly to Vegas and we get it done. They got plenty of those wedding chapel themes there, you know, like the Elvis thing. Now you're the one who's kidding, Stanley. Elvis really? Or maybe you just don't know me. No, we are having a wedding and I am wearing a wedding dress and you are wearing a tux. And that is that. Now, I'm gonna go meet my wedding dress planner, and my wedding planner, and the florist, and the person making the cake. Oh, Stanley. You have to meet me at the bakery for a wedding cake taster. No, no. I'm just gonna stay here and make a list of all my friends for your shindig. Let's see. Who am I gonna invite? Niki, Joey, Gina and my wonderful staff at the Five Season Hotel. You are such a jokester. Oh Stanley. You are so cute. Oh I can't stand it. I just love you. Okay, Stanley. I will see you later. my love. Dear Lord. What have I got myself into? What did you say, my love? No, no. Um fun tasting cakes. And remember I'm allergic to chocolate.

You know what? I didn't like that hospital. And I wouldn't have taken you to that hospital, if I were that ambulance. It was so ridiculous. It was terrible. But you know what, Stanley, let's not think about all of that. Just know that after we're married and after the honeymoon, we will take care of everything. I can't marry you, Elizabeth. I'm not in love with you. Oh no, no, no. No Stanley. I know what this is. This is a case of the jitters. And I understand the jitters, because I've had the jitters many, many times, you know, when I've gotten married before. And. But it's just the jitters. I, I understand. And I only have the jitters then, because I didn't really love those people, but I love you, Stanley don't you understand? So we're not gonna have the jitters. You and me, we are not gonna have the jitters. We're gonna, we're gonna toast to each other. We're gonna celebrate us. Elizabeth. Did you hear me? I can't marry you. Do you understand? I cannot marry you. Do you remember that time? You came to my art gallery and you said to me, Something about being my soulmate. Remember that? Well, you're not my soulmate. Oh, oh, Stanley. Get, get out. Get out. Get out! And out the window was this big white butterfly just trying to get inside. And we were on the 18th floor. And to this day, every time I see a butterfly, I think it's my Nana. What could have happened to me if fate hadn't brought you into that store. That exact moment. I mean, something led you to me. I guess, I'm too late. Oh my goodness, Stan. What are you doing here? Kristi? I just seen a guy leaving here in a red Corvette, Cooper, right? Yeah. That was Cooper. We, We broke up, but we're still friends. He brought by some of my stuff. Ever since the shooting Kristi, I've been thinking about my life and whether I would ever find my one true love. And my thoughts always came back to you. I know now that we are meant to spend the rest of our lives together. I thank God every day that you survived that shooting. When I saw you here at my door, My heart skipped All at once. I dare to think that just maybe that same Angel that sent you into my life to save it, Brought you into my life to stay in it, forever. Check it out. Yeah, that's a good carrot. Can you believe how blessed we are? Irv was able to get back all the money, the credit card charge reversed. That's amazing. I can't believe it. Somebody up there loves me. Oh, somebody right here loves you too. Yeah. The old timer just wanted to see me and Ace get reunited. He knew how, you know, how bad I felt when I gave him. And we parted. Yeah. I'm a little nervous around horses. I have to admit. 'Cause I've never really been on one of them, but I know how much you love Ace, so. Let's get your boy back. Can you believe he didn't even care about the money. He just wanted me to reunite And you know what? Knowing that you gave Ace up so that you knew that he would be taken care of.
