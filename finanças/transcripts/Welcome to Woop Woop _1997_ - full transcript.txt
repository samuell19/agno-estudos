The Abos reckon there's a big red roo… 20ft tall, carries off kids and that. They reckon it can kill a man in one punch. They're full of far-out shit like that. They're Abos. Well? How's she coming along, Boofhead? Eh? Shit. Well, fuck me dead. Is he a fucking genius?! He's a fucking…fucking genius! You could've told me! Boofhead, to be honest with you, I never thought you'd crack it. Hey, Reg! Give the Boofhead here a 20-marble bonus. We got a genius in the family! Hey, listen, mate… have you got another trick up your sleeve? (ALL EXCLAIM) All I need now is a volunteer. I need a beautiful young lady to accompany me on stage. I'm pregnant, aren't I? A thin, beautiful young lady, please! I'm getting lonely up here. Ah! A beautiful young lady. Step right up. Step in the box. Feet first. Trust me. (ALL GASP) (SCREAMS) Hey, wait a minute! (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (ALL CHEER) ("IT MIGHT AS WELL BE SPRING" PLAYS) TEDDY: I don't fit in here. Bottom of my heart, this is totally unacceptable. I mean, look… these used to be white. You talk too much. Anyone ever tell you that? My mother. Yeah, how you talk too much for your own good? - Story of my life. - There you go again. You know, you don't fit in here any more than I do. What makes you so sure? I'm a good judge of character. You making me an offer? No, but I'd be happy to. This stuff might work where you come from, but I tell you, it's not gonna work here. That's too bad. You change your mind, you let me know. You know, you might be the last one to know. Why is that? Because I'm a good judge of character too. MAN: TEDDY! - Mr Bojangles! - What? Mate, Duffy says you'd better come and have a look at… (SPLUTTERS) You reckon you can put it back together again? Why? Why? 'Cause you're a fucking genius, that's why, son. Why'd you kill the dog? Eh? Oh, that wasn't me. No, that was young Leon. He shot the dog. - It was Dog Day, wasn't it? - It wasn't Dog Day. Dog Day was last week. Oh…well, you know Leon. These young boys, they love their sport. It's Dog Day every day. What are Youse all fucking looking like that for? Got it! You're out, you bludger! (ALL CHEER) You mongrel. DADDY-O! You're not a well man, Daddy-O. You're sick in the head. Tell him. Tell him what you saw, Duffy. What did you see, Duffy? Duffy? Everybody's getting on Big Pat about the pineapple chunks. MAN: Bloody right. And all the time, you, Reggie, and my man Moose are up there in the Founding Fathers Club eating wiener schnitzel and watching the game on TV. Is that what you saw, Duffy… wiener schnitzel? Tell him. Tell him about the Marlboros. (WHISPERS) Go ahead, Duffy. - Tell 'em what you saw. - Nothing. He's scared. And you're not, eh? What are you gonna do, Daddy-O… shoot me in the back? What… are you fucking stupid? You've got pretty sizeable balls, young man… …for a Yank. I suppose you could verify that, couldn't you, Angie… the sizeableness of his balls? Relative to the average man, that is. At a pinch. You see that mine over there, son? That's the old CMG asbestos mine. (THUNDER RUMBLES) My father died in that mine. Reggie's father. Fire underground. Terrible thing. Burned for 40 days. Is that correct, teacher? - '79? - That's correct. That's when they give this land back to the Abos. Abos are pretty thin on the ground… you might have noticed that. But this is Abo land! They didn't want it. A couple of hundred people. Two generations. But some Richard Cranium on the 21st floor in Martin Place snaps his fingers and it's gone! (THUNDER RUMBLES) They got a rubber, and they rubbed it off the map. We kicked up a bit of a stink, didn't we, Moose? Made the papers for a week or two. "Life's too short for some shit of a place in the dead heart of Australia." "I'll call you back." They gave us a few bucks and they told us to piss off. They put us on a truck, me and Ginge and the kids. Moose and Pat. Couple of dozen people, all that was left… they put us on a semi, drove us to Fremantle. But we didn't buy it, did we, Ginge? No. The big, bad world. Didn't sit right. Sydney. Fremantle. Too many red lights. Too many pollies. Too many reffos. Too much fucking chaos. What do you think we did? Came back. We came back, didn't we? It's not much, is it? It's too fucking dry! Too fucking hot! Too many bloody flies! But it's ours! You might think that doesn't amount to much. But it's fair dinkum. It's WOOP WOOP! I think that's worth fighting for. Hands up all of Youse who thinks that's worth a fight! CROWD: Yeah! Didn't see you there. That was a really brave thing to do, you know, calling Daddy-O's bluff like that. I wouldn't have thought you had it in you. (SARCASTICALLY) Oh, sure. Well, it wasn't real clever, but it was brave. Isn't that so often the way? REGGIE ON SPEAKER: Well, the weather is fine and sunny. Pictures, tonight?

So, how do you do this? Reggie. He's got a soft spot for me after what happened to Midget. Tell me about Midget. Do I have to? No. I'm just curious. Did you bang him with 250ml of Thorazine or was he a volunteer? I met him in Kununurra. He was a hairdresser. See, I always wanted to have my hair cut like Elizabeth Taylor. You know, like in 'Cleopatra'. You should have seen it. It was a shocker. He was a hairdresser. Yeah, I know. You should have seen him do Barbra Streisand. It was such a hoot. So why was he climbing a rock face at 2am in the morning? I know how it looks. I don't blame you. Daddy-O's losing the plot. You heard him. He just loves this place. He's a romantic at heart. He shot your husband. Well, he knew the rules. Krystal, you give a thing a name. He shot him in the back and he minced him up for dog food. What's going on?! - Nothing. - Shut up, you fucking wombat! Has he been putting the hard word on you? She's my sister, Teddy. She's a widow and she's in mourning. I take my eyes off you for five minutes! - Please, Angie, don't get so angry. - Yeah, Angie, don't get angry. - I know what you're up to. - You do? What, you think I don't know? You think I'm blind?! Honey, what are you talking about? And I'll tell you this for nothing, you big nought. You think you can cut my lunch?! You know, you shouldn't get drunk all the time… you being pregnant. He wouldn't touch you with a 40ft pole. And you shouldn't smoke so much. And you know why? You're a dry sandwich. You couldn't get a fuck in a Frankfurt factory. Yeah. You're going to the grave unopened. (SCREAMS) TEDDY! You know how to hot-wire a 40-tonne truck? Nope, but I know how to drive one. Come on! Get out of here, you dumb bastard! Go on, get!

(GURGLES) - G'day, Reggie. - Hi, love. Have you got an appointment? Oh, no, mate. I just need a hand, you know. I'm not sleeping. I'm worried sick. - I'm worried about your dad. - Dad? How about Mum? It's doing my head in. He's been going a bit far lately, I reckon. He's blind to things sometimes, you know. Blind? He's not blind, mate. He just looks the other way. Thanks. Take them all at once. You're the biggest wanker. You've been wanking all your life, haven't you? - Haven't you? - Yes. What the bloody hell do you think you're doing?! You add a little salt. You stimulate the enzymes. Gives it good head. We all like a good head. Give us a go at that. Mmm! Well, I'll be buggered. It's good. Hey, give us a go, you boofhead. ("THE GENTLEMAN IS A DOPE" PLAYS) Krystal! Krystal!

You got a big future in this town… …Teddy-O. - Thanks. - (COUGHS) (WHISPERS) Give her a kiss. (MOUTHS) (WHISPERS) (FARTS) Pardon me. ALL: Eugh! Fogged my glasses. They drank it. Daddy drank two. He's tough, though. I don't know how long he's gonna stay down. She's my mother, Teddy. I got the keys! She's my mother. She's dying. What do you expect me to do? It's now or never. We're never gonna get this chance again. You go. What about you? Just go. There's nothing in this for you. (SIGHS) Quit your snoring, Ginger. Jeez!

How about Sonny and Cher? Here. You feel 'em? Oooh, you're a naughty girl. I'm a naughty girl. I'm a naughty, naughty girl. Naughty, naughty girls need to be tied up…and spanked. Oh, Teddy.

If we get out of here… if I ever get this rig to shift… I got a couple of things in the pipeline, something maybe you might be interested in. Is that an offer? Most definitely. (ENGINE STARTS) What the bloody hell do you think you're doing?! He's mine! I found him! Not for long, the bastard! Get in, princess. (BOTH LAUGH) You look sad. It's my face. I have a sad face. Whole family's the same… sad sacks. This is the world's greatest illusion. But don't you feel sad about the baby? No, I don't feel sad about the baby. Well, I do. I feel awful. She's not pregnant. You feel better now? She just said that to attract my attention. But how do you know she's not pregnant? (SIGHS) She told your mom. Hah! What a girl. (GUNSHOT) (SCREAMS) Get down! Get down!
