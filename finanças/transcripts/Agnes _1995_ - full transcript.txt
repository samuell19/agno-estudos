It would maybe be alright if you where only pinching this puta. But I heard all. And now I know how you are. Me that have brought you everything on a silver tray and this is the graditude. If it was not my father you would not have this sheriff's office. You would not be anything And do not forget that it is me that is the owner of this land with all that comes with it.

Everything that happens in this county concerns me You are the most beautiful flower I have ever seen. Do you collect flowers? Some of them. What do you do with them? Dry them. But flowers that are torn up they wither But if they are taken up with roots is possible to plant the elsewhere. Agnes! But there is not for-sure as fertile soil there. There can be taken small with it. I am going to plant my flower at home at Illugastaðir. I want you to come whith me there as housekeeper. You know I have a little daughter. She will off course come with you You are famous to go behind your words Well Agnes you are the only one that have not told what you did or went last night. Therefore all points at you. What do you mean? You knew where the money where hidden. Are you accusing me for robbery? It came to that. It could end by that Agnes Magnúsdóttir. Therefore I do now by the name of law to tell about what you did and went last night. Eyfi. You have hurt me. Just to take what he owed us otherwise he can nail us. This was so beautiful knife. You said that the house would be empty and we where almost caught What a damed stupidy The other bag Eyfi you shut up Eyfi. Where were you last night? Get out!

And you shall not dear to put your feet on my land I do not know better than you have written in court book that I should come in the autumn to pay an unfair fine at the sheriffs office. Is the Office of Sheriff not on you damed land? Do not twist my word like this. You do what I have told you. That is starting to be some contradictory. I think you want me to stick with what is written in the court book There is unbelievable short between Illugastaðir and Brimarhólmur. Remember that. I do not understand this. What? He told he would come today. How wants to take this woman. She can hardly work and have this son that can be used for work. I offer twenty, eighteen. Just stay here, how would take care of me if you go. Does no one offer lower Yes you are back did I not tell that here is no work in offer Johann said I could stay here otherwise I will be a tramp. You will not be a tramp. The Sheriff does not allow that and nobody offers you a job puta. You will be taken to the needy peoples auction. You will regret this for the rest of your life Agnes will not have another place so you have to sell her on the auction. What do you mean? She will stay with us. She will stay with us. You sell her on the auction or you will have me after you. You do not need further explanation or what? My Sigfús have a word with me I ask you to take Agnes for me to work for you I do not need her I have enough labor. I ask you to have here for period and I will stop by at you. This is first for you Then in the end is Agnes Magnúsdóttir. Come up to the platform so everyone can see you Agnes can work and be used for other things. I take her for eight. Six. You have nothing to do with her you have enough of maids. Five, Three, do not behave like this Fúsi two I pay fifteen country dollars for her, fifteen in silver. We have to speak with the Sheriff. We do not need him she is none needing person. Is there somebody here that wants to pay more than I want Write in you book that Natan Ketilsson has bought Agnes Magnúsdóttir for fifteen country dollars silver. You have also agreed with this Agnes. I have to speak with the Sheriff. Book this!! And here you have for the fine also. Come. What the hell !! Are you not going to tie the horse. What do you do if it goes. Do not worry it does not go anywhere. Are you sure? Did you find this funny? Now something has happened What is to see you, what happened to you. My workers. Hello May introduce Agnes Magnúsdóttir the new housekeeper at Illugastaðir. Dont you think this suits him nice Welcome. Welcome. Thank you. Don’t the guests always get the best pice? I shall do this for that I came here. Well boys now will be a big change on our table manners. Yes. How beautiful she is do you see her hands. Her hands I do not listen to this. From now on you will keep the keys I am looking forward to have my little one. I see her in front of my eyes here. She will come soon. I will never finish to pay you this money. You have already done that. What do you mean. Because now you are mine. You're are a hell of a lazy persons. This boat will not be ready. Why do you not do this yourself if you are so interested. Are you speaking with me? You have been working this morning. That is not so much. Eyfi stop this laziness. Do you think there is nothing to do here than follow your fantasies. What strange thing is there in the creek ? Where there is water there is power. We tie a rope with the boat and let the water pull it ashore. The wheel is in the middle of the creek but it does not reach down in by closing the hole one the damp rises the water and the wheel starts to turn. A man has to have the thought to use the brain not only the hands. But for bad most of Icelanders have brain like sheeps. Abroad have wheels like this have been used for century’s to make the jobs easier. But here you are burn marked and connected with witches and magic if you allow yourself to think progressive. If the worker will keep on then the wheel be ready soon and then you dont need to go all this way for water. What do you mean? Look when the wheel turns it takes water to the water slides and takes it to the house. You do not live from only water. I can not understand why there is no stock here. Uff cows and sheeps are boring animals that only give shit. Then where do you then get money. I get paid for cures and for medicines that I make. I thought you have been banned from curse. No one banns me to practice cure. Women can not do like this with an axe. I am sure I could do with small practice like you. Never, women can not do like this. What nonsense is this. Are you not the housekeeper here for us. Housekeepers are not supposed to be working outside. You will soon have something to eat dear Eyfi. Ha, ha, haa, ha Didn’t I tell Do know what I can do. I can cut a wood like this in half while someone holds it. What is most important is to hold she shaft correct Look at the spot where the axe is meant to go This is first and for all question about concentration Ha, ha, ha, this is how to do it Well Eyfi then it is your turn to show your genius and superiority Shall we do this We do not conflict me in this was it not you that was not you who came up with this How many fingers do I have. Ten why I will not make a fool of me And I thought you where so safe Do you have courage I see you keep them working What to do if it would fall. Isn’t all alright? Yes, yes. I will be quick If you come close to her I will chop of your damed dick Go north and down. You will not sleep ore have piece Cant you sleep Pétur. Yes, yes. She thinks that a bad spirit has planted in my head. Does she thing that blessed Yes there is fear I have to sleep with a fox dwarf ore crushed raven on the forehead. I have a good urging go away devil - spit Look here along the glacier side and there on the other side are done great curing It is the perseverance and ignorance of the authorities that is killing everything in this country If the people would go down to the beach and eat red cabbage then half of the nation would not die from scurvy Are you listening to me This so called doctors use only false medicine from abroad and nothing else You are also a little mad correct. Not only like them Natan I want to Elín to come to us There is no place for children here. Why do you say that. She is much better located where she is. This is not correct You promised me before I came here that she would be here with us Are you going to betray it. How does that come to your mind What shall I think You will then come with me to church tomorrow and meet her You do not give up so easily hmm Is this not a bit to much by the Sheriff Am I used to act with half power. How do you expect people to get Doctors attention That is how the law are. God helps them who trust in him. Correct reverend Þorvaður The devil's devil's hell What is this Official announcement from this fucking bastard Threats fines and scams if people come to me Come. You threaten him by pretending that there is nothing happening You do not have any idea what this means for me Do not act like this Lets go and meet Elín I will meet her later. You said you where going to meet her now I did not say a word about it and stop repeating this it is not correct. Are your words none worth. From where in hell have you got this in your head How has it entered you mind that I have come here to meet you daughter. What a dammed nonsense is that from you I have possible misunderstood. STOP THIS !!! I have plenty of other things to think of than this Natan don’t be so unfair. Æi take her home with you There is also pleasant to she that the Sheriff has been able to come here to church despite of critical circumstances Despit of the critical circumstances that have been here in the county and has taken all his time We shall pray to almighty God to help him to eradicate all corruption and give full right to all Cure all sick and all bring up all children in Gods spirit And our authority the king in Kaupmannahöfn be blessed Hi there.

That the prisoners here today Agnes Magnúsdóttir and Friðrik Sigurðsson have forfeited their life. And shall beheaded. Then the shall kneel down on a chopstick and after the heads shall be put on a pole. Take the prisoners out. There are sixty country dollars in offer. I do not care a shit what is in offer. That will become a executioner. You are settling down at Illugastaðir. It is a good land. Giving is that not true. My brother was the owner of this land but now it is mine. This I found at Illugastaðir. I see you recognise it. If you do not what I ask you I will arrange you will be put on a ship in the morning and put on Brimarhólm. There you will not live till spring. My loved Elín I know it will be hard for you to understand what is happening. Why can I not com with you? Dear Elín we spoke about this before. Who will then take care of the church for me. You will take care of the girl for me. How could you understand that I sent you away from me. But you may believe that my child that I was sure it was the best for you. I hope you will sometime be able to think nicely about mamma. If I need forgiveness from someone. It is from you. My dear angel. I is so bad that I do not have anything to give you. Do no worry about that. I will take care of Elín for you dear Agnes. Will you help me to be like I was. I will do that. Merciful lord will you take to you this unfortunate woman that now regrets. You have to trust in God Agnes. According to the ruling of the land and the Supreme Court, The execution of the judgment handed down on 21 July 1828 will take place here and beheaded Agnes Magnúsdóttir. The judgement reads as follows the prisoner Agnes Magnúsdóttir that…… No, no, no, in the name of God. Turn her. No. No, no. Let her lie like this. Dear lord. I can’t do this. You do not stop a half done job. Now you finish this yourself. The End - Endir
