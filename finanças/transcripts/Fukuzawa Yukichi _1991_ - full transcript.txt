What did you do? I was praying. BUZEN (OITA PREFECTURE), NAKATSU Don't lie! Why did you steal the sacred stone? Don't be naughty. It's just a stone. You will get divine punishment. That's just superstition. You will get neither favor nor punishment. Do you want to test it? No. The gods must be respected. My father and teacher said so. Are you afraid? Why should you, the chief retainer's son, be punished? I'm not like you. Why respect a stone? YUKICHI, 9 YEARS OLD I don't understand. Yukichi, a bad fencer is a bad samurai. Lower grade samurai like me aren't allowed to practice. Even so, you must excel at fencing. How else can you defend your lord or family? Right? Yes! Come on! YUKICHI, 14 YEARS OLD NAGASAKI Okudaira. Yukichi. - Do you like it here? - Yes, thank you. You kindly let me stay here, so that I can learn Dutch. What are you reading? A book on building castles. The way to build castles is different in Holland. It's interesting. Guess how much it costs? I'm so poor, it's beyond my imagination. 23 ryo. Yukichi, education costs a lot. It's too much for you. YUKICHI, 21 YEARS OLD EDO, 1858 How are you? Fine, thank you. My friend and I just arrived from Osaka. I'm Okamoto. Fukuzawa taught me Dutch in Osaka. Pleased to meet you. Beautiful, isn't it? It came from Nagasaki. A new gun, called a rifle, with spiral grooves on the inside. So, you study guns, too? Do you want to test it? No. I'm not good at it. You are good at Dutch. Not as good as you. You don't mean it. The principal of our Dutch school has resigned. We need someone to replace him. I recommended you. Thank you. To have a Dutch school is fashionable these days. If you become chief, I can control our education system. Toki will take care of you. Go and see him. He's always like that. He doesn't look like he would be afraid of a sacred stone. YUKICHI, 25 YEARS OLD He's gotten stronger. He's here! Welcome! NAKATSU CLAN - DUTCH SCHOOL I'm Matsukura Gensai. Please come in. Our new principal is here. We are ready for you. Not so fast... let them rest. I will get some tea. No thank you, Mrs. That's why you should stay away. It's not my fault. This is my daughter. Call me Okin. I'm sorry. You make a nice couple. Gensai and me? I mean... Matsukura, shall we go? It's upstairs. Here is our new teacher and new principal. This way. I'm Fukuzawa Yukichi. I'm Okamoto Shukichi. I'm Matsukura Gensai. Kataoka Kojiro. Yamada Matsunoshin. Kurosawa Takenosuke. Takaishi Shinnosuke. Nice to meet you. Let me have a look. Grammar? Yes. How long have you been studying Dutch? About six months. Have you ever read a Dutch book? No, I haven't. The grammar book, please. This is the text we used in Osaka. It is the basics of Dutch grammar. It explains what Dutch is. Have a look at it. This book is called 'Composition'. It explains how the Dutch language is composed. You must study these two books. Copy them first. These are Dutch books. This one shows how to make a cannon. This is a medical book. I copied this book in Nagasaki. It shows how to build castles. Read it sometimes. It's important to get used to the language. Okin! He's good... very good. But, a little too hasty. That's what I like. He's already started his lesson. Look. It's so voluminous. How long did it take to copy? I stole the book from Okudaira to copy it. It took about three nights. We still have very few pupils. I feel bad for you. Maybe I will find you a bigger school. No. I came here because I like you. I'm a farmer's son. Education is my only route to success. Hello. I run a small restaurant called 'Chidori' in front of the shrine. Gensai and the others are my customers. I hope you will come, too. This is new to me. It's called a parasol. I bought it in Yokohama. The new town? Yes. It's for foreigners and full of wonders. Let me see. Here. YOKOHAMA - FOREIGN QUARTERS What does it say? I don't know. I can't read the signs. They are not Dutch. Excuse me, what does it say? What language is that? What language is that? They don't seem to understand our Dutch. I'm American. I have spent three years in Holland. I speak Dutch. What language are the signs? Mostly English. Are there any Dutch shops? None. Look at this. Here is America... here's France, England... And here is Holland. Holland is so small! I was told that Holland was the best. No, it's not. It's a very small country. It's safe for Japan, that's all. How about its medical science or shipbuilding? Not as good as America or England, anymore. America is an industrial nation. Holland is commercial. You can't depend on commerce alone. "I thought my hometown was beautiful.” Takaishi, translate that. "I thought my hometown is beautiful.” Not 'is'. "I thought my hometown was beautiful.” It's 'was'. "I thought it was." When referring to the past, use the past tense. That's the difference between Dutch and Japanese. Yukichi, it is lunchtime. Don't blame yourself. It solves nothing. Something I was proud of turned out to be worthless. In Nagasaki and Osaka, I studied Dutch day and night. It's of no practical use. America, England, France... All the world is laughing at my effort! Then, why not study English? Without books? How can I? A ship is going to America. A government ship. My father said so. An American fleet led by Perry came and demanded a treaty. The Shogunate is sending an envoy for ratification. Can I go with them? Not on his ship, but maybe on another one, the Kanrin-maru. I know Lord Kimura who is going with the envoy. He might take you. Please recommend me. I want to see America and learn their language. Help me. With pleasure. But the problem is Okudaira. What will he say? Forget it. You can't cross the Pacific on that small ship. You will die. I will stake my life on it. Please let me go. No. You are important to me and the clan. I can't let you die. I'm prepared to leave the clan. We execute deserters. I have been so chagrined, I could have died. You can't die. Listen, Yukichi... Holland is inferior to America. But Dutch is still our trading language. You don't have to learn English. Your Dutch is good enough to live by. That isn't the problem. I want to be satisfied with my life. The world needs English, but I teach Dutch in a small school in Japan. It hurts my ears. I can be frank with you. Please let me go! Your words move me. You know how. All right! I will recommend you. This is a famous sword. My farewell gift. Sir Okudaira...! February 12th, 1860. The ocean raged terribly. The voyage was so risky, but I wasn't afraid. I wanted to see America, the advanced country, so much. March 18th. Frank Leslie's Illustrated News reported about the Japanese delegation in detail with etchings. It introduced Japan widely from administration to petty crimes of theft so vividly. It's quite different from our simple newspapers. March 21st. Walt Whitman wrote about us in his poem, 'Broadway': "Superb-faced Manhattan!" "Comrade, Americans, then to us at last" the Orient comes.” It shows their curiosity and excitement towards Japan. April 3rd. We visited a sugar mill. They explained how to make it. Japan has no such installations, but I already knew about them through books. They were surprised. I was happy. April 23rd. I bought a Webster's dictionary, with John Manjiro, the interpreter. It won't be easy for us Japanese to use, but it will greatly help our study. May 1st. I took a picture in San Francisco. She was the photographer's daughter. I'll be proud to show it to envious young officers. May 8th. Unlike in Japan where good lineage is everything, America is a free country. Effort is valued here. Here, I realize Japan's lineage system spoils everything. MURDER OF GREAT ELDER II NAOSUKE, 1860 In March, 1860, Great Elder II Naosuke was killed by loyalists who wanted to expel foreigners. FUKUZAWA SCHOOL This sign makes it look like a school. A result of your trip abroad. We will see the real result later. Everyone, good morning. Good morning, sir. It's exciting to give you a lesson again. As Okamoto told you when you entered, essentially we teach Dutch here, but I will teach English. It's not easy, but America and England are the most powerful nations. English is widely spoken. We must learn it and look at the world. This is an English-Dutch dictionary. 'Liberty' for example... Does anyone know what 'liberty' means? The dictionary says it is 'vrijheid'. Amano. 'Vrijheid' means freedom. That's right. So, 'liberty' means freedom. If you know Dutch, you can use it. I bought this Webster's dictionary in America. If you don't know English, you can't use it. An English-Japanese dictionary would be most convenient, but there are none yet that would be useful. We will translate it little by little. Listen... Learning is like a battle. You must win. There is no other way. If you lose, you will end up like me. So, don't lose! You have got to win for your parents. Take it easy. Drink! - More saké! - It's late. The gate is always open. Your money has a limit. Welcome! You look happy. The party is nearly over. My money has a limit. Then, you can drink on me. More saké! Help me. Good. He buys our drinks. What's 'free drinks' in English? "Present”. No, 'Gift'. Too bad. No one knows? "On the house". "On the house". "On the house". That's right, very good. Here's your saké. Is that right? "On the house". Thank you. More saké! Shinohara, you win. Ready? Let's give him a toast and drink on him! Cheers! I'm Kurosawa of the Mito clan. My son will quit your school. What's wrong? The government prohibits learning English. This boy is my heir. You are ruining his future. English will surely be useful to him. Please reconsider. Be quiet! Takenosuke! Come on! Come on! Takenosuke, what do you say? He has no say. Come, son! Teacher, Mr. Okudaira wants you immediately. All right. What have you done? The Mito clan is blaming me. Dutch isn't useful to us anymore. Try to understand... No excuses! You betrayed my trust. I am Chief Retainer. I backed you because of our friendship. But you threw it away. Am I wrong? Yukichi... I understand how the power of America impressed you. You fear Japan is helpless against their invasion. But you think too much of material things... and too little of spirit. I forbid not the language, but the way of thinking behind their language. Liberalism jeopardizes the system of government... and finally topples it. I don't like it. Your school is closed, as of today! Go home! Mr. Toki is here to see you, sir. Later. Not later. It can't wait. Will you let me handle this matter? It's none of your business. You are wrong. You asked me to take care of him, didn't you? I was wrong. He is lowly, after all. No better than a gateman. Lowly? You shouldn't have said that. I'm a man of importance, and Yukichi will be my son-in-law. Will he marry Okin? Yes. So, don't send him away. I'm old. I don't want to live far from my daughter. Please let him stay, for my sake. It's your fault, too. You should have told Okudaira first about teaching English. The Mito Clan blamed him for not restraining you. I was thoughtless. I will apologize to him. Good. About my daughter, do you agree? Weren't you acting? I meant it. No! Sir Toki, my family lineage isn't good... Family lineage! Okin loves you. What's wrong? I have a cramp in my leg. Do you dislike her? Hardly! I love her. Father! Please don't say anything. How was it? Yukichi wants to talk to you. What is it? Nothing. Nothing? What is it? Well, it's this... We can keep our school. Oh, that. Let's go home and have a drink. We can keep studying English? Father? Sir Toki! Sir Toki! Father! I felt dizzy. It's nothing. Let's drink. Sir Toki! 1862, NAMAMUGI INCIDENT In 1862, men of the Satsuma clan brutally attacked four Englishmen in Kanagawa killing one. This Japan Herald is popular in Yokohama. Every Saturday. It's a weekly. Can we buy it there? Translate and sell it to advanced clans. It will help us financially. Anti-foreign clans want to know foreign countries, too. Let me help you. I can learn English and about world news. It's a chance to use practical English. Then, shall we do it? Yes! I will go to Yokohama to buy one. Thank you. Hello, student! Don't you recognize me? Oh, it's you! Come over here. You didn't come to see me? No. I came to buy this. The Japan Herald? What for? We will translate and sell it. Can you read? No, I learned English by ear. Go on. Well? How sweet! It's like sugar. What will you do with English? Run a school? No, I will work for our country. The Shogunate government will fall soon. Then, our Satsuma clan will guide Japan... in a new age with our lord as leader. You will be a great man. Take it. "English Conversation"? Can I keep it? Nobu... Is that your name? Yes. Can I come to see you? Me? Can you take a day off? Sure. What do you do? You can guess. I have finished copying. Good. Take it to our customer. Mr. Kunitomo of the Kumamoto clan in Hamacho. Don't forget to collect the money. I will be going. Are you going to Sendai, Nakajo? Yes, nearly finished. What mark is this for? Dollar, the American currency. It looks odd among letters. Can't we use a letter for it? I have been thinking, but there is no proper word. Maybe we'd better spell it out. No, it would take too much space. The shorter the better. It says in the Chinese classics, "Share not heaven with thy father's enemy". Look at this. It means 'not'. It looks like the symbol for dollar. Indeed. Let's call it 'dollar'. The readers will get used to seeing it, too. They look alike. How about it? It's an unfamiliar character. If we say it is 'dollar', they will think so. It looks all right. 'Father's enemy'? All right, call the character, 'dollar'. I'm going to rent a house. Then, what? Live with me. I'm always thinking of you. I can't study these days. We meet here... make love and part. That was our promise. I can't keep it. Your face always lingers in my mind. Nobu... Live with me. Will you marry me? If you insist... Unfair! You want to live with me, but not marry me. It's not that... Give me some. Wipe it off. Wipe it off. Okin. I want to talk. Yes? I want to quit. Quit? I can't keep studying. English doesn't agree with me. I respect Mr. Fukuzawa. I like my friends here. I'm happy here. So, I'm at a loss. My friends can translate and help the teacher, but I can't. Okin... I eat a lot, but I'm useless to him. I don't like it. What are you saying? You are useful. They rely on you as if you were their brother. So do I. Aren't you eating? I'm not hungry. This is an interesting story. Abraham Lincoln looked fierce when running for president. A girl who was his fan wrote... "I think a beard would help you look softer." Charmed wives will ask their husbands to vote for you.” Lincoln wrote in reply... "I will start growing a beard today.” Democracy. If you sent such a letter to the Shogun, you would be executed. I'm back. How was it, Nakajo? I'm going to study in America. They gave me official permission. Good! What will you study? Why do human beings exist? I'd like to find out what we can't see. I see... philosophy. Nakajo... You are my first pupil to study abroad. You look fine as usual. If not, you would be in big trouble. I received a request. Sit down. When I was in Nagasaki, there was a naval cadet named Furukawa. He is an officer now, teaching navigation in the navy. He is sick. He wants to adopt someone as his heir. His family lineage is fine. He wants a man who speaks a foreign language. I want to give him a favorable answer. Why don't you become his heir? Me? It's time to work for your country, not just your clan. Takasugi Shinsaku of Choshu. Saigo Kichinosuke of Satsuma. (aka Saigo Takamori) Sakamoto Ryoma of Tosa. They are trying to reform the country, not a single clan. So will we, Okudaira and Fukuzawa. You will succeed Furukawa and lead the navy. I will unite the powers in western Japan. Let's reform this country the way we like. Well? Did you accept? I'm not the type. I have a school to take care of. But he is our financier. I can't turn him down. Maybe one of my pupils would like his proposal... but like human traffic... Aren't I good enough for the proposal? You? My parents stopped sending money. They want me back. I didn't study English to till the soil. I thought you liked studying here. I can study anywhere. For a farmer to become a samurai is a great success. - Here you go. - Thank you. Three orders of soba noodles! You aren't drinking. What's wrong? A samurai wants to adopt one of us as his heir. Okamoto liked the idea. Okamoto? That's fine. Fine? A farmer becoming a samurai! It's a great success. What's wrong? He prefers success to studying. That's wrong. It's the wrong choice. I don't think so. Anyone would encourage it. He worked hard for us. I hope you will help him. So, it's a boy. Congratulations! Your family won't have to worry. Okin... Thank you for everything. Okamoto... Congratulations! I owe it to Mr. Fukuzawa. He's hasty and worries too much, but you have helped him in many ways. I have always been grateful to you. Okamoto... Thank you very much. Okin... It's time. - Teacher. - Goodbye. Keep well. Don't look sad, friends. I'm on my way to success. 1864 - 1ST CHOSHU BATTLE 1866 - 2ND CHOSHU BATTLE In 1864 and 1866, the Choshu clan rebelled against the Shogunate. They sent an army. The government ordered us to send soldiers to Choshu. As Lord of Nakatsu retainers, it's time to work for him. Quit your study and report to your master in his fief. Follow him to battle, and do your best. Prepare for the trip and leave today. I will give you a drink and money for the trip. Obata, the leader. Obata, take it. Wait! Wait, Fukuzawa! What's the matter? Yukichi, you are not invited. Get out! Sir, you asked me to educate these students. I'm responsible for their education. Don't send them away on your own. Fukuzawa, watch your tongue! He always tries to argue. Fukuzawa... This is an order of the Lord. No room for arguments. We should work for him. That's why. What can these students do with guns? They can work only with their intelligence and education. They are promising young men. They mustn't die or get hurt in a battle that in no way helps their clan or families. I can see that, but this is an order of the clan! It's your job to refuse such an unreasonable order. Dare you criticize me? I won't forgive you! All right. I will go to Nakatsu for my students and go to war. I know the world. I'm useful even in the battlefield. Better than these five. Please make the arrangements. Gentlemen, if you want to follow this order, stay here. If you want to study, return to school. Come back! Traitor! Sit down! Stop! You will be notified later. Can you just let them go? What will you say to the Lord? Back home, some people say your domination is unfair. If they hear this... Tell them the five men are sick. Understand? Is Mr. Shinohara in? Yes, I will get him. No. Give him this. All right. Want a bite? Thanks. Shinohara has been acting strange. He sighs all day. Will this cheer him up? No. Bad news? Too bad. Not so bad. It says I won't see him again. I will be gone. Gone, with just a note? He will be desperate. Give it back. I will wait at the bridge at noon. Tell him so. Good. Will you see him? Thanks. Nobu! What's wrong? I went to Yokohama many times in vain. Let's call it quits. Stop seeing me. What happened, Nobu? He said you sighed all day. The teacher? I missed you. You can't work for the country that way. I don't have to... I don't want to. I want to live with you. If you lose your spirit, you will just keep falling... Like me. You are my hope. No... I can't be. Let's go. Follow me. It's me. Open up. Nobu... Where's Father? He's here. Get him. Hurry! Sis! Sabu! Don't steal money from the shrine. I don't. Ochiyo and Omitsu, are you helping your mother? Good. Here's something for you. Get inside. What do you want? So, you are drunk again! I told you! You would sell your daughter for a drink. Are you happy like that?! Nobu, he doesn't enjoy drinking. I don't enjoy selling my body! Listen... This is the last you will get from me! My American patron went back home. No more money from him. You won't get another drop from me. Understand?! Quit drinking and buy the kids some clothes. Now you see. This is me. Let's part. Nobu... If we work together... Don't be ridiculous! What can a man do? A girl's body earns a lot. But... Thanks. It was short, but it was a nice dream. Go! Go away! Go away, you fool! Sis... Sis... Sis! Sometimes... I'm so sad... I want to cry. Sis! THE OCCIDENTAL, SAN FRANCISCO 1866 - 'THINGS WESTERN' PUBLISHED A new book, 'Things Western' was published in 1866. Yukichi went to America as an interpreter with the Government's envoy to America in 1867. 1867 - THE RESTORATION That same year, Shogun Tokugawa Yoshinobu surrendered his rule. Yukichi! I read your book. Some say the Shogun resigned because he read it. It's selling well. People are interested in foreign countries. You sent for me. The house you are using as a school... The government wants it for a foreign quarter. Is that true? You must leave it. But where can we go? Will you help us somehow? I have an idea. There will be a war against the united army of loyalists. Many lords sent their families home. So, their houses are deserted. You can rent one. That's fine. Please help us. But once the war breaks out, the city will be burned. It's no time for school. Why don't you come back and help me? I need an advisor. Advisor? Who we will side with, the Tokugawa Shogun or the Emperor? It will determine the future of our clan. My antagonists are secretly relishing their chance. I can't tell which is which. I can only trust you. Help me. If you want a position, you will have it. I'm sorry. I don't like politics. I want to educate people and rebuild this country. Rebuild this country? Don't belittle politics. How can education change it? Politics is taking your schoolhouse. Suit yourself. SHINZENIZA, SHIBA Lord Arima's second house. Take a look. How big? About 1,400 square meters. How many pupils? One hundred and twenty. It's big enough. An auditorium... School ground... Cafeteria, clinic... An ideal school. But we will need a lot of money. We can use material from our present schoolhouse. What's the price of this place? They say 355 ryo. 355 ryo. We are right on schedule. They are glad to work. No one else builds a house now. That's true. Nakajo! You are back! Nakajo, welcome home. How was America? Is your study over? Nakajo...? "The spirit of justice rests on this holy land." "It soars solemnly to the sky..." "Taking the form of Mount Fuji." "It pours as water into the ocean..." "And circles around the islands...” 1868 - CIVIL WAR BREAKS OUT Japan was bisected by the two forces. THE SHOGUNATE ARMY VERSUS... THE UNION OF LOYALISTS Tashiro! It's you, Shinohara! It's been a long time. How have you been? Itami, Kawakami... Murata and Matsushita were with us, but they died. They died? It's war... Nobody knows when we will die. Try to stay alive. Good luck. Keio Gijuku School was opened during the war. 'Keio Gijuku' sounds great. What does 'Gijuku' mean? A public school. Not a private one like before. Public? That's right. 'Public'. It's open to samurai, farmers, anybody who wants to study. It's a big school in comparison to the old one. I'd like to study here with young people. Those samurai are fighting crazily. But here is The Occident, which cherishes liberty and education. This is Japan. Look at that. Young men go to war. They think fighting is more important than reading books. The athletics field. Athletics are part of our curricula. I want my pupils to train without swords or guns. A horizontal bar. "Bless this divine nation..." Nakajo? "The power of life shines..." "ruling over the entire land..." "keep watching and stay calm..." "the fighting power will come.” It's a poem by Fujita Toko. He is a nationalist. Nakajo used to love Occidental culture. Japan has been closed for a long time. Somehow, he mistook it as his own fault. He tried to absorb culture too fast. He was a sincere type. Poor boy! He's afraid we are going to poison him. He's taken nothing but water. Teacher... I hope you will use this money for your school. What is it? Part of the war funds given to me. War funds? KANEI TEMPLE, UENO Shogi troops at Ueno were eager to fight for the Shogun. ZOJO TEMPLE, SHIBA Meanwhile, Satsuma clan loyalists prepared to fight at Shiba. Tashiro! What's the matter? They say you will attack Ueno. Is it true? I don't know. Tell me. When? Where, precisely? Why? You are a student. Don't be nosy. Tashiro, please tell me. I want to know. I need to. Sir Okudaira. Oh, Yukichi! Push me. This is interesting. You are drunk. Be careful. Don't stop me. Push me higher. I feel dizzy. It's a nice feeling. Sir Okudaira. Don't call me 'Sir'. They discharged me from the Nakatsu clan. I'm free. I'm masterless. Is that true? I'm turning, turning, turning... I can't see what's going on... I can't see anything. Yukichi. Of all people, you aren't feeling dizzy, are you? What do you see? What do you see beyond this whirling world? I can't see the future, either. Yes, you can. So, you succeeded. Anyway, get inside. Yukichi. You are laughing at me. You are clapping your hands and laughing at me deep inside. I know. Ever since... You stole the sacred stone from the shrine. You have been laughing at me for my fear of punishment. Damn! Do you know why I hesitated? If I'd stolen the stone myself, I would have become a dangerous man who loved foreign culture. I stopped myself! Right? I had my family prestige. I had to be Chief Retainer after my father! If only I had been born elsewhere. I could have gone to study in America! Interesting, Yukichi. I was a dummy who had the big name of Okudaira. You had no name, no position, no money... But you had freedom. And you rode the tide. But I'm not beaten. Hire me in your school. My Dutch is still the best. I will teach Dutch better than you. Of course. You will be the best Dutch teacher in Japan. We welcome you. Do you really think I can teach Dutch? I ruined the Nakatsu clan in 35 years. Sir! I owe what I am to you. You made me who I am today. Fukuzawa Yukichi! No! I'm Fukuzawa Yukichi I could have been even greater! Miss Okin. I'm sorry. Don't be. Don't be discouraged, Sir Okudaira. I will take him home. Yukichi, let's go for a walk. Let's go. You can't beat me, Yukichi. I will do something you can't do. Shinohara! Amano. What have you done? Did you go to war? I was a gunner. I'm no good. The cannon drove me crazy. I deserted and walked all night. I want to come back. Ask Teacher Fukuzawa. He protected us when they were sending you to Choshu. But you betrayed him. I'm sorry. I betrayed him and went to war. But when my friends took arms to fight the Shogunate force, I couldn't just watch. Then, why not fight with them? Because I was scared. My feet wouldn't move. "Scared"? Shame on you! But that's the battlefield. He's honest. Let him come back, in my place. In your place? I went to the Satsuma clan position at Shiba yesterday. They are going to... attack the Ueno garrison tomorrow morning. They were ordered to break through the front line. Many friends of mine are among them. They will die. I want to fight with them. Shinohara, what are you saying? Shinohara, you'd better not. It's so scary... Really scary! Furukawa said... He would fight for the Shogun to die with his friends. His sincerity towards his friends is justice now. Maybe I will be scared, too, like Amano. I will tremble with fear... And become immobile... But even trembling, I wish to be together with my friends. My friends are going to die! I know how you feel. It's touching. But don't let such emotions misjudge. That's education. Education to tear friendship? It's worthless! You criticize Teacher Fukuzawa? It's up to you what you think... Shinohara. Sit down. You think I'm a coward? I don't side with either the Emperor or the Shogunate. I won't fight. Anything I teach you is worthless, isn't it? I don't think so. I can hardly tell you that to die in battle is justice! Should I say... "Die with your friends for the Emperor.” Or... "Join the Shogun's army and die with your superiors.” I can't say that. I can't find any words to justify sending my pupils to war. Shinohara... The battlefield is no place to cry for justice. Words are useless. It's a bloody place of murder! After they fight, what will remain? Bodies, charred ruins... and hate. What a waste! What a tragedy! It's absurd! It's stupid! Teacher! Teacher... I'm going back to my hometown. Thank you for everything. I have nothing to give to repay your favor... except for my sincerity. You have kept poisoning us with Occidental vice. You are ruining our imperial nation more and more. Your name will be ruined. I will save your reputation with your death! Stay back! Don't touch him. Nakajo! Nakajo! He is sick. Don't be violent. You said not to touch him. Did I do the wrong thing? Thank you. You saved me. This is the kind of man I am. Don't try to stop me. Shinohara! Teacher, I will go to war, too! I will go, too. I will be going, too. Me, too. Teacher, good bye! Goodbye! Hello. I'm Shinohara. Is Nobu in? She's out. I don't know if she will be back. I see. Give this to her. Tell her Shinohara went to Ueno. KANEI TEMPLE, UENO How many left? Eighteen if you include Nakajo. Eighteen? Keio Gijuku is finished before it opens. Shall we open it as scheduled? Cannons ready, sir. Alright. Here we go! Fire! The battle of Ueno began early in the morning. Nakajo. You must be hungry. I made these. They are not poisonous. Go ahead and eat. I ate it. There's no poison. Don't worry. Eat. Obata. Get Wayland's 'Elements of Political Economy'. Let's study. Let's have a lesson. This is the reply of Keio Gijuku to this stupid war. Take care of them. I will escort them safely. Don't worry. Be careful. Let's go. Goodbye, father. Take care. KAGA CLAN RESIDENCE, HONGO ARMSTRONG GUNS It's still raining. Awful sounds, too. Not a nice day, but... remember Keio Gijuku's first lesson began on such a day. An English politician wrote a drama. The title was 'Richelieu'. "The pen is mightier than the sword.” Someday, they will understand that swords can't settle problems. The one who speaks shall win. The day will come. We are not cowards. We are not wretched. We stay here and study on a day like this. It's our struggle against that stupid sound. Teacher! Ueno is on fire. It won't reach here yet. No more watching. Sit down. Let's begin. 'Elements of Political Economy' by F. Wayland. Open your books. "Political economy is the science of wealth." "It is sometimes defined as the science of national wealth." Don't worry, we will make it! "Political economy is the science of wealth." "It is sometimes defined as the science of national wealth." "There will be but little difference in meaning." "A country or an individual," "the way to become rich, is essentially the same.” Where are the Satsuma clan troops? Don't go! It's dangerous! Shinohara! Run away! Retreat! Retreat or I will kill you! Leave! No! Don't die! Shinohara! Shinohara! Shinohara! Shinohara! Who is it?! Friend or enemy?! It's me. It's me, Shinohara! I'm a student of Keio Gijuku! My name is Shinohara Kojiro. Please! Please, take me back to school! It's in Shiba. I beg you, take me back there! 1869 - THE CIVIL WAR ENDED The Tokugawa remnants surrendered in Hokkaido.
