Well, here we go. Having fun, darling? - Uhuh. And remember. Stay out. Darling, I hope you've enough money to pay our bill. You really want to go in here? - Of course. It looks wonderful. Anything can happen in a place like this. Yes. Anything. Welcome. London has nothing like this, has it Frieda? I don't know. There are places in Soho. Order now? Don't spare yourselves. This is my party. Clyde, you should have a rubber plantation too. Don't mislead him. I'm only celebrating. That's all. I've been out there three years today. Aren't newly-weds sweet though. I wouldn't know. Don't grouse, Dave. Claire will be here any day, won't she? Her boat docks two weeks from tomorrow. Didn't you know two weeks can last forever? David's moaning about two weeks and he hasn't seen the girl for two years. Now everything's finished and ready, two weeks seems more than two years can be. Don't forget a girl can change a lot in that time. Not Claire. She's as unchangeable as a family portrait. But prettier, but prettier. This is all I could get for your ring. It's worth more. That's the best I could do. I guess it's the best I can expect. Want a drink? No, baby. And try to keep out of trouble tonight. The boss is very angry with you for the fight last night. He says he doesn't want you in the place anymore. I don't want any trouble from you again. You won't have. Seems like every time you come in here something bad happens. It can't be the rotten place you run, could it? This place is plenty good for people that come to it. Sure. A hole for rats. If you don't like the place, why not go and not come back? You're bad luck to me. You always get drunk and start a fight. She must be a nice girl. Stop shouting and send me a drink and I won't cause any trouble. You got money to pay? Alright. But next time I'll not send for the police. I'll take care of you myself. What's the matter, Dave? You look like you've seen a ghost. I have. I thought I saw a face. The face of someone I used to know. Jim, take a look, will you. I saw her alright. Vicki Moore? - Yes. It's almost unbelievable. I can't get it through my head. The last time I saw her was at her father's place in Hong Kong. He and I were discussing my rubber business when she came in from a dance. How much capital do you estimate you'll need to get you started? I should say ten thousand dollars would be enough for the first year. Before the trees will be large enough to .. That must be my daughter coming home from the dance. It was a lovely ride, darling. I must be going in now. Kiss me goodnight. Tomorrow, Vicki? Give me a ring. Goodnight. - Goodnight, Vicki. Vicki. Is that you? Yes, darling. Good, my dear. It's quite time you were home. Father, what do you mean by staying up so late? I did not know. Vicki, this is Mr David Ritchie. My daughter. How do you do? Hello. Have a nice evening? Rather dull. Gerald is such a child. I won't disturb you. I'll run along. Goodnight. - Night, my dear. Goodnight, Mr Ritchie. Come and see us soon again. Thanks. But I sail tomorrow. Oh? That is too bad. Yes. I guess it is. He's just stopped by on his way from Singapore to the States. Some new ideas about rubber he is working on. In America? - No. I go there to arrange the outlets. Then back to Singapore and work, thanks to your father's enormous assistance. Nonsense. I think he's nice too. Get along with you. Goodnight. Goodnight. She is charming, sir. - Hmm. Too charming. I'll cable my bankers to arrange your financing. We'd better get this thing moving as fast as we can. Mr Ritchie. Yes, sir. Roy. Roy, what are you doing here? I told you I wanted to talk to you. - There's nothing to talk about. Yes there is. You and I are through. Finished. Is that clear enough? Vicki, listen to me. Vicki, I love you. I can't go on without you. I tell you I can't. Roy, it's over and when it's over .. - Vicki, please. Can't you understand? - Please. Now get out. Before I have the servants throw you out. It's not as easy as that, Vicki. A man doesn't love you the way he'd love anyone else. He lives for you. And perhaps he dies for you too. The point is, I'm wondering whether I should die alone. Maybe I should take you with me. Maybe I should do the next man who falls in love with you a big favour. Yes. A big favour. Father. Hurry. [ Gunshot! ] Vicki. What is it? What? Miss Moore. When did you last see Mr Bennett? Before he came to your house? - It was at the country club dance. Had he been drinking? - Yes. Anything else? He seemed upset about something. Were you in love with him? Of course not. - Did you give me encouragement? I see. Sir Stanley. You say that you heard your daughter call the servant and then the shot. Did you see her at the moment the shot was fired? I did not but this gentleman did. And your name? David Ritchie. You were at the house last night? - Yes, sir. What were you doing there? I went to see Sir Stanley about the finances for my new rubber project. We had just finished discussing the details when Miss Moore returned. She left quickly and went to her room. - What happened then? Sir Stanley was writing a cable to his bankers when I heard Miss Moore call. She sounded excited. I got up to see what was the matter. At that moment I heard a shot. Where was Miss Moore when that happened? - In the hall leading to her bedroom. You are certain she was not in the room at the moment the shot was fired? I am. Thank you, Mr Ritchie. Yes? Yes. Have her come in. How do you do, Mrs Bennett. Mrs Bennett? Yes. I am Roy's wife. I did not know that he was .. - I'm not surprised. Men don't tell women like you that they're married. Mrs Bennett. I've investigated this case thoroughly and I'm now sure it's a case of suicide. It was murder. She killed him. - Now, Mrs Bennett. Roy's finger may have pulled the trigger. But they won't be able to touch you for it. You destroyed my husband. Just as surely as you've destroyed other men. You killed my husband because you are rotten and filled with poison. Heaven help anyone. That touches you. If I had it in my power. I would put a curse on you. Vicki Moore. I sailed for the States the next day and lost all track of her. You can Imagine what a shock it is to see her like this. What happened to her? What happened to her is the most amazing saga of misfortune you'll ever hear. Many people call her a jinx and are afraid to have anything to do with her. A jinx? Why, that's silly. Not so silly. You remember her father as a very wealthy man, don't you? Well, he lost every penny he had when his tin mines were flooded. He died of a broken heart. When she did marry, her husband was lost off a boat and never heard from again. There you are, kiddies. The magic spell of the orient. Let's get out of here before we get morbid. Where now? - Ham and eggs at Singapore Sam's. And I'm hungry enough to eat them too. Grease and all. Mr Ritchie. Care to join us? Goodnight. Thank you very much. Come again please. Watch out the fresh air doesn't get you. - Careful it doesn't poison you. Now here we go to Singapore Sam's. Jump in. Are you coming, Dave? If you don't mind I'll skip the rest of the party. Folding up already? I go to the plantation in the morning. I'll just hop a cab and go to my hotel. Okay? - Alright. See you tomorrow night for dinner. - Right. You buy me drink, American? May I join you? If you buy me a drink. That shouldn't be difficult. Waiter. What are you drinking? Gin. Two gins. Two gins. - How about some food? No. Food makes me sick. - What does the gin do? It makes me sit here and want more gin. That is bad. Listen, mister. It's okay with me if you want to pull the lecture act. Just buy me enough drink so I don't hear too much of it. You can start with that one. The last time I saw you it wasn't very pleasant. Especially for you. What are you talking about? Don't you remember me? No. Are you going to drink that? Haven't you had enough? I've had enough of you. Goodnight, Vicki Moore. What did you call me? - Vicki Moore. That is your name? I, Vicki Moore? Swilling rotten gin in a dive like this? You are drunker than I am, mister. You don't make sense. I'm with you, sailor. You said it, baby. Go away, kid. Mama's in town. Have a little drink, cookie? - Gin. Hey, puss-face. Two gins. I haven't finished talking to you. - Why don't you go home? I am busy. - Yeah. Want to make something of it? - If you don't mind I must talk to her. I do mind, see. She don't want to talk to you. Now beat it. Come with me. - Wait. You asked for it. Taxi. What's wrong with this batch. Singa? - They're tired, boss. They are so tired they're dead. - Yeah. Dead. Clean those out and put in new plants. - Okay. New plants. Now that's what I call good growing. - Yes, boss. Good growing. In a few years they'll be tires rolling down 5th Avenue. Ever think of that, Singa? No, boss. I've never been to 5th Avenue. Good morning, Suwa. It had better be good. I am starved. Always good. Is she up yet? Not yet. You might as well wake her up. Treat her gently. She's very sensitive. [ Door knocks ] Mr Ritchie plantation. Please. Mr Ritchie? Did he bring me here? Last night. You sleep. He did, huh? Where is your Mr Ritchie now? He is eating breakfast. Good breakfast. Who is this Mr Ritchie? He is big rubber man. Very nice. How would you know? Get out! What's the matter, Suwa? That girl. She is very sensitive. Is she feeling tough? She started throwing things at me. I guess the McGonagles have got her. Don't you know about the McGonagles? In English maybe? No. They're international I think. Even Chinese. They're little men with big red noses. They run around in your head. Scraping files between your teeth. And hammering away with little steel mallets. Then they jump down into your stomach and start kicking with both feet. What do you call them? McGonagles. - Mac ..? Mac ..? Good morning. Feeling better? I'd like a drink. I thought we'd have a little breakfast. - Get me a drink. So you are Mr Ritchie. My friends call me Dave. I am not your friend. Before you tie another one on, there's a few things I want to straighten out. You don't have to start explaining anything. I'm not making any explanations. That's right. Look at yourself. Take a good look. A pretty picture, isn't it. The only feeling you could arouse in a man is pity. Pity? You pity me? You with your smug, cautious little soul. What do people like you know about me? I've lived more in a day than you'll ever dare to live. Yet you pity me. That is very funny. Because I've never had any use for men like you. Now that sounds more like the old Vicki Moore. So you know who I am. - I told you last night. I never remember last nights. As I was saying. I told you last night that I owe your father everything I have. He made this plantation possible because he backed my experiment. He backed me. It was his belief in me that built this house. He planted those rows of trees. He never cared about his favours. That's why you're here, instead of sat in the Crow's Nest or a place like it. Stop it. You are breaking my heart. Alright. But I wanted to put you straight on that before you got any wrong notions. Now, will you come to breakfast peacefully or .. Do I have to get tough? It's restful here, isn't it. Peace and quiet. It's good for the nerves. Peace and quiet. That's what you get after you're dead, isn't it? It helps some when you're living. It all depends on what you call living. I see it as just a hop from minute to minute without time for rest or peace. You just keep going. Up and up and and up and higher and higher right to the final crash. I don't suppose you know what I'm talking about. Yes. I think I do. But You haven't been going up. You've been going down and down. Why? Haven't they told you? I am a jinx. Yes. I heard about that. But I'm a very practical person. I don't believe in witches, voodoo or bogeymen. Everything I touch. Everybody I come in contact .. I just said I don't believe in jinxes. I'm telling you for your own good you'd better stay away from me. All the people I know cross the street when they see me coming. I am poison. I am no good for you. We'll see about that. Anyhow, I know something that would be good for you. I am not interested. You are a spoiled brat, aren't you? And I don't like being babied. All I want to is to get back to Singapore right now. Now listen. Why not stay here a couple of days? You've been going too fast. You should have a chance to catch up with yourself. Leave the cork in that bottle until I get back. Will you get away? I'm sick of looking at you. Okay. But take a good look at yourself before you take your next drink. I'm driving into town now. Keep an eye on her, Suwa. You will eat now? And the machinery will be shipped to you by boat. Arriving about the 24th of next month. Yours very truly. That will be all, Miss Oswald. Thank you. Morning, Miss Oswald. Hello, Jim. Dave, glad to see you. What are you doing in town in the noonday sun? Chasing mad dogs and Englishmen. Jim. I got it. - The loan? Fifty thousand American dollars signed, sealed and on deposit in the bank. Great, Dave. Now you'll be able to help the defense program. They need rubber in the States. - I'm the fellow to get it to them. Fine. What's the matter? - Nothing. I'm a little upset. When did you say Claire was docking? - On the 26th. Why? But she won't be on that boat, Dave. She won't? Why? Well. For one thing .. For one thing I'm here now. Claire. Hello darling. Remember, the parking time in this office is five minutes. I don't get it. I thought you had .. I know. But I flew down from Manila. I couldn't stand it any longer. Are you surprised? - You can knock me over with .. If you say 'feather' I'll scream. - Say. Remember me? The old man of the mountain? Never saw you before in my life. I'll get stuck for the luncheon check anyway. Yes. But not until I've had a bath and a new paint job. Then you take me out to see the plantation? Right? Sure. I am sorry. Not today, darling. It's not fixed up the way I want you to see it. Besides, I didn't expect you so soon. Alright. But you'll take me tomorrow? You seem very anxious to see your future home. Well, that's just it. You see, I've a feeling we'll be living in Singapore and not out in the sticks. I want to see it quick so we have no argument. We'll fight about that at lunch. - Alright. Hey, what about me? If the food will be this good I think I'll like Singapore. I'll see to it personally. Boy. Check. Everybody always takes me at my word. Specially when it comes to lunch checks. Alright. I'll go on being the sucker. You are sweet, Jim. I think I'll go up to my room. I won't be long. We'll wait for you here. - Alright. Dave, what's this business about not taking Claire to the plantation? The roads are bad. You know how storms come up. Come on. That's pretty lame. What's the real reason? There is somebody out there. - Who? Vicki Moore. Vicki Moore? You took her out there? - Yes. I know what you're thinking. But you're wrong. I took her there to try and help her. - I see. The humanitarian touch. You know how much I owe her father. When I saw her in that dive the way she was it was the least I could do. That is a pretty plausible alibi. - Be sensible, will you. You don't seem to realize I'm engaged to be married. You don't seem to realize it either. The way you are holding out on Claire. I'm not, Jim. Really. Just afraid she won't understand. I can see what you mean. It is even hard for me. Stop it, will you? I'm trying to tell you the truth and you must believe me. It isn't that I don't believe you, Dave. But I've seen so much grief involving Vicki Moore .. That I don't want you to get involved. - I'm not going to get involved. I'm going to the plantation this afternoon to bring her back to town. Tonight, when we meet for dinner she'll be out of the picture. I promise. That's the stuff. The sooner the better. Waiter. Keep the change. Hello Suwa. - Mr Ritchie. You come. Good. I forgot to tell you. I won't be home for dinner. Then I give it to monkeys outside. Where is our guest? Gone out. - Out? Out where? I don't know. I said to watch her, Suwa. Did she go out in the jungle? She say she goes where she wants. She say: Suwa, go some other place. But a storm's coming. You let her go. She is no good. She break the look-see glass. The mirror? Maybe she make herself seven years bad luck. And go away. Vicki. On top of everything, we've got soaked. I told you not to go into the jungle. Some people like to walk in the rain. - I'm not one of them. What did you say? - I said I'm not one of them. Do you have to do that? It may make it more comfortable for you. - Well, it doesn't. I'm sorry. - That's quite alright. Am I getting heavy? - No. Is that better? - Will you please stay quiet? I'm only trying not to be a deadweight. - Well you are a .. What were you going to say? Nothing. Except you'd better walk through that door. Let's get a drink. I don't think I want one. Suwa, get Miss Moore a change of clothes. I should say I didn't bring a suitcase. Suwa will get something that belongs to the girls. Where are you going now? - Into Singapore and you come along. I am? - You are. You're straight now and can take care of yourself. Do you think we should wait until after the rain stops? And get some dry clothes on. After all, you are no duck. More coffee? - No thanks. If I ever saw a case of the jitters you have it, my friend. I should be in Singapore for my appointment right now. I would be too if it weren't for this murderous rain. The rain? It can't last forever. Why not? As long as it is raining there aren't any problems. We can just go on like this. Never worrying. Never remembering. Not even other rains. It always stops sometime. Sometime. Of course. Are you leaving now? I've got to get into town. Good morning, Suwa. Hello. Suwa has a rather extensive wardrobe, hasn't she. How do you like this one? It's very nice. You might at least have smiled as you came in. Even if it were a lie. I've got to tell you something. What? Last night, when I held you in my arms and said all those things to you. They were beautiful things. I didn't mean them. Well, they were whether you meant them or not. I can't mean them. I have no right. What's she like, David? What do you mean? A man like you doesn't run around loose. Some nice girl always has first call. Yes. She is nice in every way. Her family is nice. Her background. Her way of living and thinking. Everything about her. Lucky, isn't she. - I suppose so. At least until she became engaged to me. I didn't know you were engaged. Where is she? - Here. In Singapore. She arrived a few days ago. I should have told you before but .. You're a very fascinating person. With the rain and being here alone. I don't know what happened to me but it did. I am sorry. I know I am hurting you and .. Please forgive me. Hurting me? When you took me in your arms I almost laughed in your face. Only I was afraid to hurt you. Sure. I know all about the rain and being alone in the dark. You fell for it like a schoolboy. But don't worry. I'm not going to spoil your life for you. Or your safe little career. Hurt me? Stop it before you make me hysterical. You did come back. You couldn't believe what I told you, could you? I lied. All those things I said were lies. But David, there's one thing I do want you to remember. Last night was mine. It was beautiful. And this morning I made it ugly. You know why? - Why? Because. Something happens to me when I'm hurt. I always want to strike back. I wanted to hurt you since you said you brought me here because you pitied me. I can't stand pity. I hated you. That's why I wanted you to take me in your arms and hold me tight and kiss me. So I could laugh in your face. My chance came last night. But when it happened. I couldn't laugh. I wanted to cry. Vicki, listen to me. - No. Hmm. - What? All the latest numbers. 'Java'. 'Japanese Sandman'. 'Whispering'. That's what I like about you, David. Always up to the minute. Don't blame me. Somebody left them around. Okay, boss. The car is out. The bridge is fixed. You can go now. In what? - Truck. She more better than walking. - Thanks, Singa. Okay, boss. Are you going? No. No. It can wait until tomorrow. David, you must. Please go now and see her. Because if you stay it will be too late. You may not love me but you'll find you always come back to me. Don't you see, David? I am being kind. Kinder than I've ever been and I can't be much longer. Go on. Leave. You can leave me. Can't you, David? Mr Ritchie, he will come back? I don't know, Suwa. I don't care if you did teach me to play, I still think .. Even experts can make mistakes. Thank you. Mr Ritchie, it's your play. Oh, I am sorry. Are you tired, dear? - A little. Jim, what do you know about those tin mines out in the Kinta district? Nothing much. They bought equipment from us when they were open. The whole place is closed now. - Yes. I know. Are you two going to play bridge or aren't you? I don't think David has his mind on bridge. Let's stop. - I am sorry, Claire. Could you stand some fresh, damp air? - Alright. The best hand I've held all evening. That's life. Something's bothering you, Dave. No. I'm just tired. You are wearing yourself out on that silly plantation. Why not sell the whole thing and go back to San Francisco? You can work in father's office. Claire, there is something. I want to tell you that I .. - What is it, darling? No. It's not important. Claire, would you mind very much if I left now? No. No, of course not. I would go home too if I were bored. - I'm not bored. Just out on my feet. I see. How about the sightseeing tour of your rubber trees? Tomorrow? - I can't. I must stay in town a few days on business. I'll call you in the morning. - Very well. Goodnight, Dave. Goodnight. - Dave. As one fianc?e to another, aren't we forgetting something? I am sorry, Claire. Goodnight. - Goodnight. Boss. I look all over for you. - Hello Singa. I wait. I wait. You no come back. What I should do with rubber? She ready to go. She should be gone now. Yes. I know. The telegraph come every day. Every day we wait we are losing many money. Boss, you must make up your mind. You got to tell me now. Yes or no? That's right. I've got to make up my mind. He no tell me. Give me beer. Straight. Well, where have you been for the last three days? Hello Jim. - I said where have you been? You leave me to ask the questions when I don't know the answers. Yes. I know. I am sorry. - Claire is awfully worried. Did you go to the plantation? - No. Where did you go? I was trying to make up my mind about Vicki Moore. Dave, you're a fool. I've told myself that a hundred times. - Why don't you get rid of her? I'm not going to. I've fallen in love with her. Have you the faintest idea what you're letting yourself in for? Don't you know that girl .. - Is a jinx? Yes. I know. Men have killed themselves over her. And all the rest of it. I think I know what made them do it. Because I've battled against if for three days. Well, there's no use warning you against something you've already realised. What about Claire? I'll tell her, naturally. I'll drop by on my way home. I hope you know what you're doing. Jim. I want to buy the equipment from your company to open the mines out in Kinta. Are you crazy? Have you any idea how much it costs? No. Tell me. - Well. Forty or fifty thousand dollars. - I have that much. The money the bank gave you for your plantation? I will do it. It's no use calling me a fool again. Jim. It's the only way I can think of to get her back on her feet. Those mines were her father's dream. Now they are her dream. They represent what she was before life crashed in and knocked her flat. You see? If I restore that to her she'll begin to live all over again. Dave, I won't let you make an idiot of yourself. I don't know what you can do. I can stop you from using the money the bank loaned you for your plantation. I can refuse to sell you nickel's worth of equipment. And by heaven, I will. In that case, I guess I'll have to get the equipment somewhere else. Dave. Dave. Just a minute. Yes, Jim? When do you want to start work? Thanks. Don't bother. If you're going to smash up your life, I'll stick around to pick up the pieces. You are wrong. There won't be any pieces. Thanks again. So long, Jim. Missy like some tea maybe now? No. I don't want any tea. Get out. Wait. Suwa, I am sorry. I didn't mean to be nasty. Why doesn't he come back? He should have. Hello Claire. Hello Jim. - Did you see Dave? See him? Didn't you know I've been posing as the forgotten woman? I guess you have at that. Listen, Jim. Why won't Dave take me out to that precious plantation of his? Well, he's had a lot on his mind. - What? Certainly not me. Why don't you ask him? - I see. You men and your code. Alright. I think I'll take a drive out to that plantation. And find out a few things for myself. It might turn out to be a swell idea. It might at that. David. Let's go inside. There's something we have to talk about. What is it, David? Vicki. Ever since I left I've been trying to fight against you. All my life I worked hard for something with permanence and security to it. Your life has been just the opposite. You live from moment to moment. We're not the same. I know that, but .. I have always been told that opposites attract. Aren't we proving it? Yes. Yes. We're proving it alright. What I have to know is whether there's anything permanent between us. I've got to know that or .. Or it's no good. David, I'm so much in love with you that nothing else matters. Tonight. Tomorrow, I hope I feel the same way. I want to terribly. But I've been able to count on tomorrows because they never played fair with me. Don't you see, David? I love you so much, I won't promise you something I can't be sure of myself. At least that is an honest answer, isn't it? That is a gentleman's answer. Maybe I'm not enough of a lady to lie. I could promise you I would love you tomorrow and all the tomorrows to come. But suppose something happened and I couldn't keep it? Did you ever break a promise? No. Because I never made one. Would you be happy if you could carry out your father's plans with the mines? Of course it would. Then you're going to. What do you mean? - We'll start opening them this week. David, you are crazy. That's impossible. They're moving in the equipment now. It's all paid for. David, you fool. You crazy fool. I won't let you do it. Something will happen. It always does. I tell you I am a jinx. - That's exactly why I am doing it. To get you over this ridiculous nonsense. While you always think of that there won't be any happiness for us together. I don't want to marry a jinx. I want to marry Vicki Moore. Marry Vicki Moore? I thought you knew that's what I've wanted to do. Yes, David. But I'm afraid for you. You needn't be. Everything has changed now. Just believe that. Claire. Who are you? David, who is this person? Miss Moore. Vicki Moore. This is Miss .. Vicki Moore? With you? Here? Claire, it isn't Vicki's fault. No. It isn't Vicki's fault. It never is her fault. I knew all about this so-called 'jinx-woman'. Who destroys everything she touches. And blames it on bad luck. Or some kind of strange fate instead of her own viciousness. So David tried to help you? And out of gratitude you took him away from me. That's hardly fair. Sometimes people can't help it. - Yes they can. They live according to the rules but Vicki Moore makes her own rules. David, will you let me talk to her alone? Please. Why should he? We have nothing to say that David can't hear. Please. If you love him. David, please. Look. I'm not going to fight with you. I don't expect tolerance and I'm not asking for it. You and your kind don't want any part of me. Maybe you're right but tell that to David. Tell him that I'm no good for him. Tell him to forget me and marry you. Beg and plead with him. Do anything you want to make him get rid of me. But fight for him. Why should I fight for something that you are willing to throw away? Because what I'm throwing away is the finest thing to ever come in my life. I'm not going to hurt it as I've hurt everything else that ever touched me. See here. I didn't come across half the world. To beg a man to decide between me and .. Something like you. You idiot. You selfish petty idiot. I thought you loved David. I was wrong. You're not thinking of him. You're thinking of yourself and your silly pride. You stand for something, don't you? For society. For everything that's called 'respectable'. Because you condemn me, you condemn David for loving me. That's harder on David than it is on me. But I'll fight for him. I'll see to it that I don't hurt him no matter what I have to do. To myself or anyone else. Come on, you guys. Come here and try these. Hello Jim. - Hello Dave. I was hoping you'd get here soon. How do you do? - Hello Mr North.. Brown thinks we'll be through pumping in three days. I brought these plans along. I thought they may help you. Plans for what? My father had them made after the flood. In case he ever had a chance to reopen the mines. Oh. I had better show them to our chief engineer. Mr North doesn't carry off his dislike for me very gracefully. Don't worry about him. He loves to act tough. Are you excited? About all this? David, you know I am. It's wonderful what you've done. Vicki. - Yes, David? Now you do something for me. - Such as? Such as marrying me tomorrow. Tomorrow? - Of course tomorrow. Doesn't a look around here convince you that there's no more jinx? Yes it does, David. Why not tomorrow? Yes. Yes, David. Why not? That's the way to say it. Well, I had better go and look after the family interests. I'll be right back. Miss Moore. - Yes? They said you were here. This came for you. Thank you. Well, everything is going along fine. It looks like we're .. What's the matter, Vicki? David, will you drive me back to Singapore now? Sure. What is it? I would like to do some shopping. - Shopping? You mean for your trousseau? Yes. For my trousseau. Well, the bride will look lovely. Anyway, the bride will look lovely. You may come in. Hello Vicki. It was nice of you to come. This is my solicitor, Mr Melrose. - How do you do? Sit down. You'll be more comfortable. I will leave you two to your reunion. I'll wager you haven't seen many ghosts. John, where did you come from? Saigon. I read in the paper you were opening the mines again. With this war and everything the tin business must be flourishing, eh Vicki? Why aren't you dead as we all thought? I got a kick from reading of my falling overboard and not being heard of again. So did my creditors. I swam to one of the beaches. I didn't have any worries so I decided to .. Stay dead. I wish you had. What's the matter, darling? Aren't you glad to see your husband? I never was glad to see you. - You were an awful pain too. Especially after your father lost his money. I don't know why I stuck to you as long as I did. Why didn't you divorce me? Number 1. I may have been stuck with alimony. Number 2. I had a hunch you'd turn up with a handful of gold one day. That day hasn't arrived, John. I have no money. But you do have a mine. As your lawfully wedded husband that's where I come in. If you don't believe me, my solicitor can show you the statutes. I'll believe you. You were always able find loopholes no-one else could see. Thank you, my dear. However, I think it would be fair if we go out to tell Mr Ritchie about this .. New arrangement. - Mr Ritchie? The gentleman who furnished the money to put the mines back in operation. I see. Of course. By all means let's tell him. How about a little dinner first? Then we'll go tell Mr Ritchie. John. - Yes, my dear? I've changed my mind. I don't think I want to see Mr Ritchie. - Why not? I don't want to see him. Not with you. I'll go alone tomorrow. - Alright. How long have you known Mr Ritchie? That has nothing to do with it. - Hasn't it? I'm beginning to wonder how Mr Ritchie came to invest his money in our mine. Don't you have the reputation of being a bit of a bad risk? John. I love him. I was going to marry him. You love him? This gets more and more exciting. He is going to be very angry. I would be too if I found the woman I was to marry had a husband already. We must hurry. John, you can't do this. Please turn back. I'm begging you. Not for the world, Vicki. I'm more eager than ever to meet your Mr Ritchie. John, not so fast. What is it, Vicki? You've changed. You never wanted to slow down before. It was always excitement and speed. Speed like this. May I use your phone to call my paper? The pay stations are out of order? All I have is a 100-dollar note and I'm keeping that to do the town with you. Don't spend all the money you are saving all in one place. Alright, sweetheart. Get me the Singapore Express please. Hello, Elsie. Give me rewrite. Jean. Fred. Fred. This is Eddie. I am at the hospital. Now listen. Vicki Moore was badly injured in a car smash last night. Yes. With her was a man who was identified as her husband. No. Neither did I. His name is John Wetherby. I am David Ritchie. I wish to see Miss Moore please. Hang on, Jean. I'll have to ask the doctor. Doctor. This is Mr Ritchie about Miss Moore. - How is she? She's quite badly shaken and suffering from shock. She has a slight concussion. She'll be on her feet in a week or so. The man's condition is more serious. Man? What man? He was identified as her husband.. Her husband? - Yes. Would you like to see her now? No. No. I don't think so. There ought to be a law against printing stuff like that. There ought to be a law against women like that. Don't forget, Dave. You went into this with your eyes wide open. That's right. Except for one little thing. Why didn't she say she already had a husband when I asked her to marry me? [ Buzzer ] Yes? Mr Sidney Melrose, solicitor. To see Mr Richie. Do you want to see him? Send him in please. Mr David Ritchie? - I am Ritchie. I represent John Wetherby, the husband of Victoria Moore Wetherby. Well? I regret this intrusion, gentlemen. But, in the interests of my client I am forced to serve notice on you. To cease trespassing on the premises of the Victoria Moore tin mines. Trespassing? Are you crazy? I've got fifty thousand dollars in that mine. Can you prove that, Mr Ritchie? Can I ..? Mr North knows it. I bought all the operating equipment from his company. My client and I have every reason to feel .. That your contribution was in the nature of a gift .. to Mrs Wetherby. Unless you have recorded documents to the contrary. In the absence of such papers I protect my client's interest with this notice. Good day, gentlemen. Can they do this? - Well, they have done it. It wouldn't surprise me if Vicki Moore and her husband framed this whole thing. Are you sure you called his hotel? Yes, dear. Now you mustn't worry. Everything's going to be alright. It's been almost two weeks. Did you talk to him? I told you, dear. You mustn't get yourself excited. You did talk to him. What did he say to you? He said .. he wasn't interested. [ Buzzer ] Miss Moore to see you. Tell Miss I'm very busy. I can't see anyone. I've got to see him. Just a minute. Please. I am sorry, Mr North. What are you doing here? What do you want? Where is David? Don't you know when a man's had enough? I've got to see him. I want to tell him the truth. I love him. He'll understand. I don't think Dave will ever try to understand anymore. He must. I didn't know my husband was still alive. He turned up when he heard about the mines. I tried to stop him. I find it difficult to believe you. David will believe me. Haven't you done him enough harm already? You might at least leave him his self-respect. Self-respect? What do you mean by that? Consider yourself. What you've been and what you've done. You say you love David. If you do, let him go. Give him a chance to live and think like a normal human being again. Something happened this morning that made me think I could start over again. I see I was wrong. You can take a letter to David. I won't try to see him again. Got everything, sir? This and my health. I guess that's everything. Too bad it worked out this way. After what you did to put the project on its feet. With you and Mr North out, who do we take orders from now? The new boss is John Wetherby. At present he's in hospital so a lawyer named Melrose will tell you what to do. Bye, Frank. - Take care of yourself. So long. Sullivan. - Goodbye. Goodbye. Good luck. All set? - All set, Jim. I promised to deliver this to you. Do you know about this? - No. What is it? It's a transfer of ownership of the mines from Victoria Wetherby to me. How could she? What of her husband? He died this morning in the hospital. I want to see Miss Moore. Miss Vicki Moore. Moore? You mean Mrs Wetherby? Sorry, but she checked out yesterday. Where did she go? - She didn't leave an address. How much longer before we sail? About two hours. Do you mind if I just sit here for a few minutes? Boss, look. She come back. Didn't I tell you not to come in here? Don't worry. I'll only stay a minute. - That's too long. Every time I see you it costs me money to fix up my place. Now get out or I'll .. - Is that any way to talk to a lady? So you are here too. Now your boyfriend is here, you both get out. There won't be trouble. This is different. What about the last time? It couldn't have been more than that, could it? Well. This should make it about right. Do you mind if I join you? Why can't you leave me alone? I'm no good to you or anyone else. You should know that by now. If you're referring to that pet jinx of yours, that's all over now. Look. One good old American horseshoe. I found it this afternoon. It's guaranteed to rid you of all bad luck. It's no use. You're rid of me. Leave it that way. Listen, Vicki. It's not only for good luck. It has a magical effect when hung round the skulls of stubborn people. You understand? I understand. So you've come back, huh? You remember me, don't you? This time I will fix you. Boys, throw him out. Yeah, I know. Louder. What happened to him? - A horse kicked him. Let's get out of here. Hey, rickshaw. Step on it. See, it has brought us luck already. - And a black eye as well. That doesn't matter. Spit on it for luck. Spit on it. Now, over the left shoulder. Duck. ..w-g..
