...grace to perform the things they have promised before thee, and sanctify with thy spirit... this child now to be baptized according to thy word, through Jesus Christ, our Lord, amen. Reuben, thou child of the covenant, I baptize thee into the kingdom of God. - What is it, Malachi? - Sergeant Bell is coming. Oh, excuse me. Looks like I'll be hangin' some more of your flock, Doctor. - Palouse, huh? - Kamiakin's people. Go inside, boy. They keep forgettin' those commandments you teach 'em. Prospectors. We found 'em about an hour's ride from here. He's just a boy. Couldn't have been over 12 years old. I'll mention that to Kamiakin when I catch up with him. Abraham, you and your boys take them over to the burial ground. Abraham? Palouse, isn't he? No offense, Doc, but quite a few Palouse rode with Kamiakin today. And you baptized and gave names out of the Bible to most of them. Funny how that baptizin' washes off with some of 'em. Emmett, as I recall, part of your job is to keep prospectors off this reservation. Big reservation, Doc. Jacob's inside. Well, Malachi, you're learnin' a trade, huh? I am printing the Bible for Dr. Holden. Malachi, ask your father and Elijah to come in, please. Leah. He's growing big, isn't he? He's just been baptized. Reuben. That's nice. He rode from the fort without rest. What's headquarters worried about now? Major Donahue sent me, Emmett-Sun. You're to meet him at the Snake River now. - What's he doin' there? - That's what the chiefs are asking. A meeting of the tribes has been called. Elijah and Isaiah came here first. Kamiakin has asked us to a council at his lodge, Emmett-Sun. Then you'll be there when I place him under arrest. Kamiakin and his people have always been thieves, but now they've become murderers. - Tell them what I brought in. - They know. Then why do you dishonor the Coeur d'Alene, the Spokane? Why do you sit in council with this Palouse murderer? Emmett-Sun, many troops have left Fort Walla Walla and have come into our land. They are led by a leaf colonel, and this time they bring cannon. Ask your man. When I talk with a friend, must I ask anyone? As our friend, bring us the truth. You goin' to this council? Isaiah came to take me. I'll try my best to prevent trouble. If you do, write it in the book. I've always wanted to see a miracle. Timothy, who will represent the Nez Perce at Kamiakin's council? As their chief, I have the right. You also have a good pair of ears. Use 'em. - Not that I don't trust you, Doctor. - I understand. Oh, and, uh, take Lucas with you. Nobody figures there's a brain behind a face like that. Emmett, those troops must not cross the river. I agree with you, Doc. - How far did you get, Malachi? - This is the last page of Genesis. "And Joseph said unto his brethren, "'I die, and God will surely visit you and bring you out of this land... "'unto the land which he swore to Abraham, to Isaac and to Joseph.'" "And Joseph took an oath from the children of Israel, "saying, 'God will surely visit you, "'and ye shall carry up my bones from hence.' "So Joseph died, being 110 years old, "and they embalmed him and he was put in a coffin... "in Egypt." I was raised on it, Doc... chapter and verse. My old man rammed it down my throat... until I was big enough to run away. I can quote that book to you forwards or backwards... which is the devil's way, isn't it? Well, Zachariah, what game do you hunt that you stand here like the rocks? I hunt no game but that which come to hunt me. Hear me, Sergeant. My people are not of Palouse who kill and steal against you, nor of Nez Perce who wear your blue jacket. Coeur d'Alene walk middle road. But this not mean we are women who will not fight. Halt! Dismount! Who... Who goes there? Well, halt! Come on. Halt. They wouldn't halt. - Maybe you said it wrong. - I said what the book said. Maybe he didn't read the book. You can make camp down by the river... while I go see the sergeants. Plenty new, these recruits. Now, look, keep an eye on our boys. No tradin'. But, Emmett-Sun... There'll be no genuine Sioux scalps for sale. Last time we met up with recruits, there wasn't a horse left in the troop with a whole tail. - But... - No! Are you sure your precious flock can't see... you put aside your show of pious abstinence? Look at him, Carry. Isn't that beautiful? That much whiskey would drown an ordinary trooper. Trooper, is it? The man's an empty keg. Where's the major? Up at headquarters, conferrin' with the new colonel. A great one for conferences, this colonel. Fifteen years at West Point. An engineer, no less. Did I just cross the Snake on one of his samples? Yeah, and they build 'em with recruits. - Before long, they both collapse. - What a collection. We've been wet-nursin' 'em ever since we got 'em from San Francisco, along with the colonel and some new officers. Oh, there's been some changes, Emmett. Well, there's gonna be a few more. Only one canteen? It's a very small still. Yeah. I'll have the engineer colonel build you a larger one. I hope the headquarters tent is pegged down solid. A lovely man and a fine soldier. But he drinks. - Hello, Emmett. - Major. Say, who's gone crazy? What's that bridge doing out there? And what's this all add up to? Uh, Colonel Stedlow, this is First Sergeant Bell, the chief of our Indian police force. Winston. Well! Why, I didn't know you were here, sir. Well, this is wonderful. Uh... Well, you see, sir, Captain Bell was... That is, Sergeant Bell was my company commander during the war, sir. Bell was made a captain in the field, Colonel. He reverted to rank when the war was over. Oh, then you also know each other. Yeah. Yeah, Captain Gaxton and I know each other. Hey, you... you finally got that mustache to grow, huh? Oh, yes, sir. Uh, yes, sir. Make your report, Sergeant. I don't know why you're here, but the tribes don't like it. They're grouping back in the hills, and the chiefs are sitting in council with Kamiakin. And what does that mean? That you've got trouble... a bellyful. All that land beyond the Snake is theirs, given to them by treaty. It's not bad enough that you've brought a full column right up to the boundary, but now you've put that stupid bridge across the river. Attention. That stupid bridge was built to move cannon and equipment. The federal lands north of the reservation are to be opened to settlers. A road will be built across the reservation to those lands. My orders are to build a fort to protect that road. We signed a treaty with the tribes. It reads that no white man, civilian or soldier, can enter that area... without permission of the chiefs. I've read that treaty, Sergeant. It also contains a clause saying... that the government can put a road across the reservation and a midway fort. The chiefs can't read fine print, and neither can I. - That will be all, Sergeant! - Yes, sir. You're not dismissed yet. I've let you overstep your rank... because of your unique position. But from now on, the army will act as police force here. As of right now, you and your Indians are a scout force... attached to Captain Gaxton's troop. Have you anything further to report? Only this, sir. Sergeant Timothy, one of my scouts, is sitting in on that council called by Kamiakin. When he gets back, we'll know if you can stick your head across that bridge... without getting a Palouse haircut. - Sergeant, have you been drinking while on duty? - Yes, sir. Lieutenant, place this man under arrest. I'll prefer charges myself. Well, that's Sergeant Bell, Colonel. Away from his scouts, he's half drunk all the time, all drunk half the time, and rebelliously insubordinate, drunk or sober. A shame and a disgrace to his uniform. But if you had a hundred more like him, you could ride into hell and put out the fires. Get to the picket line, boys! - Guard those horses! - Come out! On your feet! Fall in! Move! Corporal of the guard! Corporal of the guard! - What is it? - Over there. Emmett-Sun, hold fire! Why, you stupid... Sergeant, what are you doing? Give that sentry back his rifle. I'll run it down his throat if those men are hurt. - You'll what? - Those are my scouts he was shooting at. The sentry gives no challenge, just shoots. - Either one of you hit? - He didn't even hit the tree. I'm, uh, sorry, sir. - I apologize to the lieutenant. - You're quite right, Sergeant. Are these our scouts? - Yes, sir. - Bring them to the colonel right away. But Sergeant Bell is in command of the scouts. Shall I bring him along, sir? Sergeant Bell is under arrest. Come along, mes enfants. Sergeant, can't you teach your men anything? In this army, it's customary to issue a challenge before you shoot. Well, sir, it said in the book, I should say, "Advance and be recognized." But I didn't recognize either one of 'em. - Get back to your post. - Yeah, but, Sergeant... - Get to your post! - But... But, Sergeant, he's got my rifle. Here's your rifle. Oh, these bare-bellied, no-beard, first-hitch, bottle-baby soldiers. Take 'em away from their stable sweepin's for one minute, and they go shootin' off their rifles before breakfast. Well, I told you they was bringing too many civilians into the service. There's goes officer's call again. Me, I like a commanding officer can make up his own mind. There's an old sayin' amongst us Indian fighters... I just made it up. First you lose your nerve, and then you lose your scalp. And the colonel's a nervous man. Emmett! Emmett! Colonel has decided the charges against you will keep. - You are wanted at headquarters. - What took 'em so long? You, get back to your troop. - What's going on? - It is those scouts. They're talking Chinook. Or perhaps it is Chinese. Colonel no savvy. But what was said at the meeting? Can't you speak any English at all? What the devil is he saying? Tell him, Timothy. Oh, no, no. That's... That's enough. It was the bridge, Emmett-Sun. Kamiakin says it was built to cross cannon and men. He said the treaty is broken. - The talk was of staãq. - Staãq? Is that their word for war? Not just war, Colonel. Extermination... bloody and total. Was Dr. Holden able to do anything? He made the chiefs agree to a meeting at the mission. He said you must come and bring the leaf colonel. - He said without delay. - Now, who is this Holden? He's a missionary and a doctor. The Indians swear by him. Gentlemen, it is our duty to accomplish our work peacefully. I'll try everything within the limitations of my orders. You may inform the chiefs I will attend this meeting. - I'll take "B" troop as an escort. - No. Only the scouts will be allowed to escort, Emmett-Sun. Colonel, in the event of trouble, they won't be any protection. There will be no trouble. Dr. Holden has the word of the chiefs, sworn on the cross. And they'll hold to that. Your faith in these people is much greater than mine, Sergeant. Turn "B" troop out. Emmett-Sun. - Gaxton, come back here! - Sergeant Bell! Kamiakin holds hostages. You move out with troops and they die. Two white women, taken from the wagons that were burned. I talked to squaw who tends white woman. One tells she is wife of big soldier. Also daughter to star soldier. Captain Gaxton, isn't your wife the daughter of General Rainesford? Yes, sir. But I can assure you that Mrs. Gaxton hasn't come to Oregon to see me. Is it possible she came without your knowledge? Colonel, whoever those women are, they won't live long if you make the wrong decision. Have your scouts ready to leave right after mess. Officers dismissed. Emmett-Sun. - It is the Lord's day. - Yeah. Colonel, my scouts would like to join your services. - Services? - Well, it is Sunday. Yes. Yes, of course. Bugler. - Yes, sir? - Turn out the camp for services. Yes, sir. Services, sir? Church call. - Don't you know it's Sunday? - Oh, yes, sir. - Then it is Calla Kamiakin's holding. - Probably. I missed her by a day in Oregon City. She'd left for the mission with a prospector and his family. I didn't lie to the colonel. My wife isn't up here to see me. - She came to see you. - Then she's a fool. Only where you're concerned. I made the mistake of leaving Major Donahue's reports on my desk. One of them mentioned you. Next morning she was gone. You did pretty good. Kept her from finding out where I was for three years. You were no good for her then! You're no good for her now! That's why I came up with Stedlow's column. I'm gonna keep Calla away from you... even if I have to kill you. But first you're gonna get her away from Kamiakin. - Yes. - Why, you spit-and-polish soldier. This isn't a saber-waving cavalry charge you're leading. Learn to tie your moccasins before you try to become a scout. You wouldn't get 50 yards beyond that river. You don't want that to happen? I don't want Stedlow to have to move his column in to gather up your remains. You're not worth a war. - What happens to Calla? - You can only get her killed. I may have better luck. Calla's shining knight to the rescue again... just as she's always dreamed about you. I'm a better soldier than you, and I'm a better man. Unfortunately, I never learned to crawl on my belly like an Indian in the brush. Know this, Tom. I've never looked at Calla since she married you. - Why don't you leave it at that? - Because it won't work. Ask her when you see her. I hate your guts, Emmett. You wanna hold up a minute, sir? Most of the chiefs are already here. Spokane, Walla Walla, Coeur d'Alene and the Umatilla. Kamiakin hasn't arrived yet. - He'll make an entrance. - Kamiakin. He seems to be the only chief who hasn't got his name out of the Bible. Well, sir, he was baptized Aaron, but he hates it so much he threw it away. Timothy. Ride slowly, sir. I'm Dr. Holden. I'm glad to see you, sir. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate all you've done. Emmett, would you present the colonel to the chiefs? Chiefs of the Nations, this man is Edson Stedlow, leaf colonel of the United States Army. His words are those of the Great Father in Washington. This is Elijah, chief of the Spokane. Isaiah, chief of the Coeur d'Alene. Simon, chief of the Umatilla. Isaac, chief of the Walla Walla. Kamiakin, chief of the Palouse. You've come with soldiers and cannon. So be it. I hold two white women. If you cross the Snake River, that day they will die. Tell this man who makes war with women... that my orders are to build a fort, and rightfully so, in accordance with the treaty he and these chiefs have signed. He can understand you, Colonel, if you'll speak with him. I do not threaten, nor do I speak with men who threaten. I make no threats. I ask only why you have come... to build this fort upon our ground. We will talk as men of peace. Talk? Of what? These mountains mark our land. Our fathers know not even these boundaries. But we have promised to live here between the Pillars of the Sky, though our people are crowded one upon the other. There's not game enough to feed a single tribe. Now these soldiers say even this is too much. There is no talk left. There is only staãq! Staãq! Staãq! Staãq! Wait! Wait! You speak of our fathers. My father's bow would have torn the arm from my shoulder before it broke. We have lost the skills of our fathers, chief of the Palouse. We lost them a thousand suns ago, when we first took an iron knife from the white man. And now we have this. You cannot fight or hunt without one. Can you make one? The food in your bellies. The iron pot you cook it with. The tobacco in your pipes. These belong to the white man. The medicines when you are sick. The whiskey that turns you mad. Both are his. And so it is. The good in your lives... and the bad... are bound up with the white man. And so you say let them brush us to one side as though we were dead leaves. I say we will fight. Then you will fight. But even should you drive him away, you will have lost. For if the white man goes, then we must follow, for we no longer know how to live without him. Then what is the end? The end is this: The white man and the red will live together. Oh, it will not come in our time, Coeur d'Alene. And until it does, it will be hard. But from the white man, too, has come a faith that will help us wait. Then take their faith. But for me there is this. I will stay on this land. And if there is no game, then my belly will be lean. And if there are no hides, then I will run naked. If I have no gun and my bow breaks, then I will fight with a club or stone. I will heal myself or I will die... and put my faith in the ghosts of my fathers. But I will live as my own man as I have been taught. And if my tribe be lost, let it be lost in battle, not swallowed up in the belly of a different people. So wear your blue jacket, Nez Perce, running dog of a stripe sergeant. Timothy! You have yet to speak, Isaiah. I... I do not know what is right. Your brother Zachariah knows, old man. He and your braves have joined my warriors. If you are the chief, obey their will. This talk is finished. Well, there's your answer, Colonel. Thank you for trying, Doctor. Now you better come with us. I'm gonna march that column as soon as I return to camp. You won't be safe here. Thank you, but the sergeant and I have work to do. With the colonel's permission, I'll want Timothy and Lucas. Jacob and the scouts can take you back. The women? I have learned to walk silently. Join the column when you can. Good luck, gentlemen. Any particular reason for you to come along? I can't afford to lose you, Emmett. You heard Timothy speak of a faith to help them wait. - Yeah. - He was looking at both of us. In case anything happens to me, I can't think of a better replacement. Me? Oh, Doc. Seventh tepee on the left side. Two old men sit before it. The young warriors make ready to ride to the Snake River. At morning they will be gone. Morning will be too late for us. Can you fire a tepee without being seen? Hides don't burn. Here. Try a little of this. Might not even have to light it. Belongs to Carracart. I took it by mistake. Naturally. Careful it doesn't explode. Lucas, you stay with the horses. What good would that do against the whole village? Emmett! Come on, woman. They killed her husband and son. She saw it. - Who are you? - Shh. Come on. Stedlow'll have to come through here with his column, if he gets this far. It's a good place to wait out the day. If he does not pass, we will ride again tonight. Find a place for the horses. You stay away from me. Don't come near me. Mrs. Avery, don't blame all Indians for what happened to you. - They killed my man and my boy. - Doc, keep her quiet. - I don't... No! - I'll take care of her. Come on, Mrs. Avery. You'll be all right. Stay out of sight and don't make any noise. Sooner or later, you'll have to talk to me. You may wish I hadn't. Tom is with Stedlow's column. He had himself transferred to follow you. He knows why I'm here. He also knows our marriage was a mistake from the start. I tried to stop loving you, Em. I couldn't. A little late, isn't it? Oh, Em, how long must we go on punishing each other? Don't deal Tom out. He's in love with you too. Too? I was talkin' about Tom. Very well. Let's both talk about Tom. How do you think he feels, living with me as my husband? Knowing that every time he touches me... every time he looks at me... I'm thinking about you. Frankly, I don't care. I do. You taught me this, Emmett: When you cut, use a sharp knife and do it quickly. That's why I'm here. I'm taking you back to your husband. You made a deal, Calla. Stick with it. As for me, I still drink, I'm still broke, and I still draw a sergeant's pay. Is that what you've been telling yourself? Any other reason why you didn't marry me? You. A man who had to make his own rules. My father could've helped you hold your commission. But you wouldn't go to him, not you. No. Rather than ask a favor, you'd humble me. The general's daughter had to be the sergeant's wife. - Take it or leave it. - I still make my own rules. I don't care. Not anymore. I only know I've got to be with you. Emmett. - Well? - Palouse in the valley. Well... There really are Palouse in the valley. They're movin' away from the Snake. They keep ahead of the column until they find a place for ambush. And you can bet Stedlow's followin' along behind 'em, - like a lamb to the slaughter. - Careful, Emmett-Sun. Her husband is with the column. Go help Lucas keep the horses quiet. Tell her to stay out of sight. Can you make out who's leadin' them? Did you ever play poker? - When I was younger. - You must've been good. We were engaged to be married once. You don't have to tell me about it, Emmett, unless you want to. Suppose I tell you I'm still in love with her? Then your decision's going to be all the harder to make. She's very lovely, Emmett. No, sir, Doc. You're... You're never gonna play poker with me. Calla came to me. I mean to keep her. Now what are you gonna do? I'm gonna get some sleep. Call me when you're ready to move. - Sergeant Bell, sir. - Halt! Halt! Why, you knock-kneed, addle-brained... Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Hold it, Morgan. Don't you abuse that animal. The army got you for free. That horse cost 'em 50 bucks. Well, all right. But, Razorback, one of these days I'm gonna sit down to breakfast, - and it's gonna be you. - Hey, look! Sergeant Bell's bringin' in some women. I wonder where he found them in this forsaken land. That proves a point. A good soldier can live off the land, finding all the basic necessities for survival in the most unlikely places. Yep. I read that in the book. But I didn't think it meant women. Sir, that is my wife. Sergeant Bell reporting, sir. We were able to effect the release of the prisoners. - Are they all right? - Yes, sir. Very good, Sergeant. Mrs. Gaxton, I realize this is a very poor time to say this, - but very strict orders were issued... - I'm sorry, Colonel. I disobeyed not only your orders, but Tom's. Uh, better be thankful she's alive to tell about it, Colonel. Yes, I suppose you're right. - You're a very lucky woman, Mrs. Gaxton. - I know. This is Mrs. Avery, wife of one of the prospectors that was killed. Captain, you and the doctor take the ladies to the ambulance wagon. Later we'll discuss plans for returning them to the fort. Yes, sir. There's your bridge, Colonel. How do you propose to get them to the fort? I know we've been cut off to the rear, Sergeant. There was no point in frightening the women. Do you also know that the other half of Kamiakin's forces... - are movin' ahead of you? - I do. We've crossed the Snake and Kamiakin hasn't attacked. He's made no attempt to stop us. I doubt that he will. He doesn't wanna stop you. He's gonna cut you to pieces. Rejoin your scouts, Sergeant. Yes, sir. Advance the column. - Forward! - Forward! - Ho! - Forward! Good evenin', Dominie. Evenin'. Evenin', men. Mind if I join you? - Please do. - Here. Have one of my blankets. Thank you. - Coffee? - No, thanks. Ah, there's music in the lad, Dominie. It was a sad day for his mother and my sister when he came into the army. Well, then, it'll be a happy day when he comes home to her. The boy's old enough to know the truth, Doctor. He's not goin' home. Has God given you second sight that you can predict the future? This outfit's got no future. Ha! My apologies, Sergeant. I was rude. Please continue playing, son. ♪ Down in the valley ♪ ♪ The valley so low ♪ ♪ Hang your head over ♪ ♪ Hear the wind blow ♪ Just because we have a fool for a colonel is no reason to let you die. I'm takin' you out of here. I'm going with him, Tom. I'm tempted to let you start out. Then I could have you shot as a deserter. Where do you think you are, on a parade ground in San Francisco? This is Kamiakin's country. Ever seen a woman when they get finished with her? She'll be safe with this column. - Here. You'll need this. - I'm not gonna let you do it. Can you stop me? With this, if I have to. Look out! - Horse detail! - The Indians ambushed 'em! - Ho! Grab those horses! - They've been ambushed! Good Lord! They've been cut to pieces. Don't stand there gapin'! Cut those men loose! Kamiakin says it will be soon. Corporal, pick a detail and take care of it. Renaldi, get those horses to the picket line and double the guard. Hold it, Carry. Let's turn 'em into soldiers. It's time. All right, attention, you bottle babies. - Fall in and file past! - Come on! Let's go! - Come on, corporals. Make a move. - All right, get in line now. - Give me that lantern! - Move it! - Move. - A picture to carry in your heads, mes enfants. Three troopers who got careless in hostile country. Take a good look. And remember. Look at it. Waco. They got Waco! Let me go, Sergeant! Let me go! - They're killing him! - Let's hope so, soldier. All right, nobody told you to break ranks. Keep comin'. Oh, my God. The Pillars of the Sky, Doc. They were sacred to the tribes long before you came with the word of God. - Halt! - Halt! Captain, take a detail. - Go after that man. - Yes, sir. If you do, you'll have to send a troop after the detail. Then you can send a column after the troop. He's right, sir. Kamiakin probably has 500 men behind those trees. With your permission, sir. - Forward! - Forward! - Ho! - Forward! Ho! Keep those eyes front! Get back in there! Back in line! - Come on or I'll beat your brains out! - Get back in line! - Right now! - Come on! Shut up! Shut up back there! Whoa! Whoa! - Put another driver on there and get 'er movin'! - Murphy, get on the wagon! Salvage what you can. Put it in the next wagon. Calla, get out of the way! Bring that wagon up here! Come on! Calla, are you all right? Come here. Take your men and clear off that hill! Calla, get in the ambulance. Never mind the rest! Get outta here! - Lieutenant Hammond, look after Mrs. Gaxton. - Yes, sir. Corporal, bring your squad. Hyah! Come on! Move it up! Come on. Stay closed up in there! You gonna leave him here? Hold that wagon! You first two men pick up this trooper and put him in the wagon. Zachariah. Alive. Take him to the ambulance. Keep him alive, Doc. We can use him. Yeppie! Haw! No sense leavin' this for Kamiakin. Might be well to rejoin the column, Captain. Or were you thinkin' of leavin' me behind? Unfortunately, that's impractical. - Is it still possible to get Calla out of this? - Maybe. Your scouts tell me we've captured an important chief of the Coeur d'Alene. Yes, sir. I'd like to make a trade. Safe conduct for the two women back to Fort Walla Walla... in exchange for Zachariah. I doubt that Kamiakin will agree to that. Zachariah is the brother of Isaiah, one of Kamiakin's strongest allies. I think Dr. Holden could persuade the chiefs to make the deal. What do you think, Major? One chief more or less won't change the odds on this fight. If we can get the women out, let's do it. I'll be glad to talk to Kamiakin, Colonel. - Are there any other conditions? - None at all. All right. Do what you can. Plenty of snipers... both sides. Bugler, halt the column. - Dismount! - Column, halt! Captain Fanning, - deploy your troop for skirmishes. - Yes, sir. Dismount and deploy! Advance on guard! - Dismount! To the slopes! - Dismount! Hold your fire until you see something to shoot at! You two take him to the ambulance. The rest of you spread out and keep moving! All right. Just you keep it up. One of these dark nights you're gonna turn up missin'. Come on. - Is he dead or alive? - He's dead, sir. Last wagon, with the others. Ah, it's blood, my lad, but you got a barrelful of it in your veins. - All soldiers do. Get in there. - Come on, soldier. Take him back. All right, get that wagon movin'. - Come on. - Come on! Emmett-Sun. Halt! Looks like Holden made a deal. Timothy, put Zachariah on a horse and bring him here. Uh, with your permission, Colonel. I suggest the colonel mount the column. This might very well be a trap. - No, it's not. - The colonel'll decide that, Sergeant. Sorry, sir. Kamiakin has accepted. One man will be permitted to take the women out. How do we know Kamiakin will keep his word? Isaiah's taking care of that. He sent his son, Malachi, to go with the women as evidence of his good faith. - Well, who'll take the women out? - Dr. Holden? You'll need me here. I'm a doctor. Who would you suggest, Sergeant? There seems to be only one choice... Mrs. Gaxton's husband. You are free to go, Zachariah. And for this, the women will be allowed to pass through to safety. Why am I used to save any of these? Let's not have any discussion. Major, cut him loose. Trooper, get the litter-bearers. Gaxton takin' his wife out would've simplified things. Your man let you down, Doc. Perhaps he was just making it a little harder, for all of us. A lot harder. Sergeant, have Lieutenant Hammond move his guns forward. Yes, sir. - We have to take that hill, Captain. - Yes, sir. - Alert the wagon drivers. - Yes, sir. Come on, boy. Oh, Doctor. Tell the boy to return to his father. I will stay with you, Doctor. Bugler! Oh, Mrs. Avery. Look after this boy, will you? I wouldn't touch him. Why, he's only a child. Oh, Doctor. Will you take over at this wagon? I'll be needed at the other one. Certainly, Major. Come on, boy. Whoa. We're gonna try to make that hill before they break through our flanks. When we start, make those mules move. Yes, sir. This is gonna be rough, Mrs. Gaxton. Better make sure everything's tied down back there. We'll protect the left flank. Haw! Ho! Now anybody that wants a 10-day furlough, he can have it for the askin'. But anybody that asks for it had better bring me back a handful of those turkey-bird feathers, or he'll wish he'd never joined this outfit. Them babies up there are gonna do a lot of yelling when they get started. You can shut 'em up quick with these butter knives. So slice 'em thin, boys. Slice 'em thin. Fire number one! Number one, fire! - Fire number two! - Number two, fire! Sound the advance! Keep it moving! Take my horse, sir. Get back on that horse, you little idiot! Get those wagons... Carry! Whoa! Quick. Get him on my horse. Down! Now! - Go, Dutch! - What about you? Get out of here! Bell! Bell! Get goin', Doc! Clear 'em out! Go on! Come on! Get off of those horses! Get back to the rocks! Get down. Get down. Get behind the wagon. Doc! Doc! Lance in the back. Bandages, clamps... out of the wagon, quick. Hurry it up! Don't say it. Frenchy, me and the others. It's for this that we're soldiers. Sorry about your sister's boy. That's a shame. The music in him is stilled. I'm glad I won't have to tell her. I'll tell her. Here. Here's some somethin' I brought along. Ah, there's hardly enough for yourself. I can get more. So you can. Sergeant Bell, the colonel's called an officers' conference. He'd like you to be there. Mind your tongue, Emmett. I've grown to like the little man. Major Randall is busy with the wounded, sir. Well, where are the others? There are no others. Your report, Captain? Thirty-two enlisted men fit for duty, sir. And four scouts. Not much left of my command. Under the circumstances, sir, you... you did the best that could be done. Was it the best? Considering the orders you were given, yes. I'm proud to be serving under you, sir. How about our water and ammunition? Gone. Lost both wagons. We have less than 20 rounds per man left. That's not so good. Well, we can't stay here long without water. That's obvious, Lieutenant. The main problem is: How are we gonna get out? I was hoping you could answer that. No, I'm afraid I can't. Sometime tonight, Kamiakin will hit us with everything he's got, and then you'll have your answer. But I heard that Indians wouldn't fight at night. Something about their ghosts not being able to find their heaven in the dark. These Indians don't believe in ghosts, Lieutenant. Thanks to Dr. Holden, they're Christians. O Lord, here we commit these bodies... to their kindred dust. Earth to earth, ashes to ashes... and dust to dust. Calla. We've never lied to each other. There isn't much chance any of us will see tomorrow. I know. I never made you happy, Calla. I wish it could have been different. I'm sorry. I wasn't much of a wife to you, Tom. We never had a chance. There must be many things you would like to say to Emmett now. Go to him and say them. Oh, Tom. Good-bye, Calla. Tom sent me to you. And you came? Dr. Holden just looked at me like that too. What did he do, preach you a sermon? No, but seeing his eyes was enough. They were torn between pity and contempt for me. There was a moment this afternoon. You and Tom were close together, fighting your way up to the ridge. I watched until I felt Dr. Holden looking at me... as though he were accusing me of wanting one of you to die, to put an end to my problem. - Calla. - He was wrong, Emmett. But how could I expect him to believe... that I was thanking God you were both alive? Stop it. Stop it. If you give way, you'll make it harder for all of us. We've only a few hours. Or have they been telling you lies? No lies, Emmett. This is my night for the truth. I've been chasing something all these years that was never there. That's the first truth, isn't it? Calla, it's too late to matter now. It matters to me, Emmett. I'm seeing a lot of things clearly for the first time. Like that moment today when the wagon turned over. I reached up to you, but you rode by yelling, "Calla, get out of the way." It was Tom who asked if I was hurt, Tom who cared whether I was safe. Oh, how... how stupid to realize it now. That's the way it's always been. Despite everything I've done to him, I've always mattered to Tom, never to you. The time is too short. We're past making up for old mistakes. - We're past regrets. - Oh, I... I wish it were so. Until now, I could never see beyond the dream of you. It was always stronger than the reality of Tom. With him, I had every chance for happiness, but I destroyed it. Now it's too late to even... to even hope for forgiveness. Oh, Emmett. Emmett. All I have left are regrets. I see you're looking at Kamiakin's fires. It's mean hard for a man to be alone around here. A man's never alone, Emmett. All right, Doc. I've been looking at those fires on the steep side of the butte. They're still burning bright. But over here where we came up, they're dying down. I imagine that's what you've been thinking about. I wasn't, but I am now. - Where's Timothy? - He's already taken the scouts down for a look. They're also trying to find a way for us to move down. Well, let's get to the colonel. I knew you'd want to see him. - The sergeant has something to show you, Colonel. - Yes, Sergeant? Look down here, sir. Well, I see the fires, if that's what you mean. - Kamiakin's camped all around us. - I don't think so. I say all his warriors are massing at the foot of the slope. That's the only side he can mount a charge. They're letting their fires burn low so they won't be back-lighted when they attack. Now, if we can get down this steep side, sir, I don't think we'll have much opposition from there. When my scouts get back, we'll know for sure. We won't get far on foot. - We'll have to take horses. - And we'll pull their shoes. A barefoot horse can make it down rough terrain like a mountain goat. At least we may get to your mission, Doctor. There's water there. Pass the word, Sergeant. Have the column prepare to move out. Yes, sir. Which was it, Doc? Your sharp eyes or your powerful prayin'? - How many more? - This is the last. I threw out the grays. Only taking sorrels, bays and blacks. - Good. Hurry it up. - Sergeant, your scouts are coming in. Fifty horses and a black night, and I have to pick you, Razorback. Or did you pick me? The bright fires are not attended. - No guards? - There were eight. - Are the men ready, Captain? - Yes, sir. We'll move out immediately. Emmett. I found this in the wagon. Yeah. The owner will be glad to get it. Don't move me! Gag him, Major, unless you want Kamiakin to quiet him. All right. Major. You're not taking Carry. We have no choice. He's finished, Emmett. Take him out. Hey, Sarge, how about that furlough? I got me that handful of turkey-bird feathers. Now, don't worry about it. As soon as we get out of this, you'll get your furlough. Well, Sarge, I... I guess you know how... - Well, I mean, we've been... - All right, move along, soldier. Yeah. Yeah. Ah, me legs are that numb I feel nothin' from the knees down. Have you ever known such a cold summer night? Now how did you know what it was? When did you ever carry water? It's been an honor, Sergeant. Likewise, sir. Do you mind? - Please do. - To you. That's got real power, hasn't it? Aye. We'd better move out, Sergeant. The fires will have to be kept up, Colonel, or they'll know we're gone. I understand. Get out. Oh, the brass gets to drink, but I don't, huh? I'll split you. Your split. All right, you've had your drink. Now get out. What about the fires? I'll tend them. That's the trouble with that low-grade whiskey. It doesn't hit you till you try to move. Well, how's it going, Sergeant. Fine, Doctor. And you'd better be doin' the same. Oh, there's plenty of time. I'll leave with Emmett. Then shame on you for the company you keep. Ah, the music that was in that boy. Hold it, Doc. Night birds. Yeah. ♪ Sittin' on the ice till my feet get cold ♪ ♪ Sweet thing ♪ Sergeant Bell and Carracart. Who's the third? That would be Dr. Holden. Of course. How soon before Kamiakin knows there are only three? Soon. But it's safe to ride now, Colonel. Pass the word to mount, Captain. You scouts, take the ladies up with you. Pass the word to mount. Get Dr. Randall. Have the lieutenant keep the column moving. Doctor, the colonel wants you. Captain Gaxton is hurt bad. Lieutenant, you're to keep the column moving. - Oh, no! - Mrs. Gaxton, no. - We've got to keep moving. - I've got to go to him. Get on my horse. Ah, it's a lovely party. Those night birds are closin' fast. You better get out of here. ♪ Down in the valley ♪ -♪ The valley so low ♪ -♪ So low ♪ Now that's enough. There'll be no more tunes. The party's over, my friends. And a good guest does not keep his host up too late. - ♪ Hear the wind blow ♪ - ♪ Hear the wind blow ♪ Must I put a bullet through my head to get you to leave? I'd rather use it on one of Kamiakin's boys. Carry, I... Oh, I got this letter before I left Walla Walla. Clean slipped my mind to read it. Not that I need 'em, you know. It's just that the light's gettin' bad. His name is Samuel. Next month he was gonna build a new altar for the church. Sorry to turn your church into a fort, Doctor. Once I would've told you it wasn't necessary, that nobody would ever raise a hand against this mission. But... now I don't know. You will before long. They're just over the hill. - Sergeant, post your men and stand by. - Yes, sir. All right, men, break it up and get back to your posts. Captain Gaxton took a knife in his side when he killed Samuel. I think he will die. All right. You go on back and help Mrs. Avery. If he is dying, you might be able to make it easier for him. And for yourself. - How do I do that? - Tell him the truth... that his wife loves him. Why not? Nothin' I need to tell him. Don't worry about him dyin', Doc. He won't. Not now. Three eagle feathers. Kamiakin sends a truce. They say Malachi must be let out. Tell them the rest. Timothy and my scouts will also be allowed to leave the mission in safety. Staãqis only for the white enemies. My faith is in God, not in Kamiakin. Malachi! No! No! No! Well, Kamiakin has his answer. Timothy, you're a fool. I learned from you. Well, now, what does that mean? Get some water on that roof! Save that ammunition till they ride in! Get me some water! Timothy! Get some water in here! Come on. Get me to a window I can shoot from. Prop him up here. Dr. Holden! Kamiakin! Isaiah! Elijah! Chiefs of the Nations. I ask you to hear me. Don't. Kamiakin! Why did you shoot before he could speak? Could so brave and strong a warrior be afraid of words? What might he have said that you fear? To you, Isaiah, he might have spoken of a son... a boy, Malachi, who must be killed now. For if he is not, he will grow tall, always reminding the father of what he has done today. He might have said to you, Elijah, and the Christian chiefs who ride at your side, that now you must burn your church to the ground. For if any trace remains, if will forever tell you of the black thing you do. This, too, he might have told you... Now that you have abandoned God, surely God will abandon you. So you must give back your names. Elijah, Isaiah, Simon, Isaac... These from the Bible you can use no longer. From now on, as you did before, take the names of animals, for you are no better. This man gave you the most precious gift he had, his God. He rode out now to show you his great faith in that God by giving you his life. You did not take his life. He gave it to you. Dr. Holden! Dr. Holden! There is only you to lead us, Emmett-Sun. "And Jesus said, "'I am the resurrection and the life. "'He that believeth in me, though he were dead, "'yet shall he live. "'And whosoever liveth and believeth in me, "'shall never die.'" Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, Father of mercies and God of all comforts, who comforteth us in all our afflictions... that we may be able to comfort them that are in any affliction... with the comfort where with we, ourselves, are comforted. Hear my prayer, O Lord, and with thine ears consider my calling.
