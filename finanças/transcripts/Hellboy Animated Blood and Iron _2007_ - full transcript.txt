In 1944, a demon was summoned to the earth to wage war, but the child of hell was rescued by good men who taught him honor, kindness, and a sense of right. The scientists and researchers that gathered around the boy became the bureau for paranormal research and defense, an international organization that protects the world from occult and supernatural threats. There are things that go bump in the night. We're the ones who bump back. Can this be him? The one I have waited centuries to see? How strange. So far from his path that I barely see the promise of glory. Can this be him? This hellboy? Oh, crap. Is something wrong? No. Yeah. I'm standing up to my butt in crap. That's what's wrong. - Where are you? - I don't know. I got all turned around. It's like a damn maze down here. A maze of crap. Isn't that why we're here? Company. Crap. Don't suppose this will work. No, but it'll piss him off. Go wide. I'll have to remember that trick. I'm guessing that's important. No. I've got it. Uh... Hmm. So who do you think this is? Not Hephaestus, surely. Daedalus? He designed the labyrinth. Don't care. Hey, Liz. You can tell the professor he was right. We took care of it. You can tell him in the morning. He's already in bed. All right. See ya soon. Who are these mortals who would have you turn your back on your own kind? Who? Professor. Professor broom. You think she's here. Somewhere close. They both are. - Father? - I am all right. Your fiancée, she could still be alive. But there's not much time before... What? - Blood. - Fresh blood. Father, we will need you. Yes. Yes, of course. Anna. No. No. Anna. No. Not my Anna. My sweet Anna. Father, will you help? No. No. I... I can't. Yes. If it will bring her peace. We still have to find her. Then assist me with this. Empty. Where is he? Erzsebet ondrushko. Wait. Stay together. Stop. We mustn't panic. Please, stay together. - We have to get out. - No! Run, professor! No! You brought the others, yet you did not flee with them. Something to calm your nerves? Holy water. My face. You... you've stolen my beauty. Missed you at breakfast. I just... overslept. Okay. See you at the briefing. No. No, no. They were in Pakistan. I'm sure of it. How could I forget? We found them after dealing with that sand demon thing. Or was it the andes? Actually, I believe it was in tangiers. Boy, can't wait until I see a little action. Careful. I connect it with the ghouls under sidi qasim. Really? I remember webs. Lots of webs. You're both wrong. They were in Budapest. Of course. - After the run-in with... - That thing. In the choir loft. With the arms. Yeah. Oh, god. What was the name of that place? - The... the... - The monkey paw. Yes, the monkey paw. Yep. That's where we found 'em. Found what? The best pastries on earth. Excellent. The very best. Yeah. These... this is crap. Hi, guys. Good morning, everyone. Professor broom. Professor corrigan and I have just a few assignments to... assign, and then we can all get on with our day. How's that sound? Coffee's cold. Oh! Hot! You'd think he'd learn. Yeah. You'd think. All right then. Let's get started. Hellboy, you're going to Tibet. You'll team up with Mr. Clark. Now, the trung ram monastery. Yeah. Reputedly built from the bones of 9,000 monks. It was dismantled and burned by the mongols in the 13th century. 800 years. Now it's back. Is it just me, or could we use a nice, big conference table? It's just you. Miss sherman, Mr. sapien, you'll be going to British Columbia. Ogopogo has been cited again in lake okanagan. This time it's evidently flipped a couple of houseboats. Think I'm being type-cast. Aren't we all? Professor broom? Thank you. All right, we've got one more for this morning. Small thing. A favor, really. A friend of the bureau has requested an investigation. An old house in the Hamptons has just been purchased by Oliver trumboldt. Trumboldt? The hotel and casino guy? Yes, he wants to open it as a resort. And... says it's haunted. Oh, god. Can you say, "publicity stunt"? A waste of time. Look, trumboldt is a good friend of senator langsford, and the senator has his hands in the bprd budget, so no haunted house investigation, no more doughnuts. No more research equipment. - No more... - Give it to the new kid. - Mr. leach. - Thanks. Excuse me, but I think it would be wise to have hellboy handle the Hampton house. Right. The senator would love having a top agent like hellboy make an appearance. Mm. Top agent. But it's more manpower than the assignment requires, and, well, we need hellboy in Tibet with Mr. Clark. And the 9,000 dead monks and... Liz and Abraham should go too. What about me? Maybe I should go. No, that won't be necessary. It's more manpower than... You see, it's just a political favor. Oh, for god's sake. It's a publicity stunt for crying out loud. I have a hunch. Oh, a hunch? Oh, well, sure, go. We'll just post a "no swimming" sign on lake okanagan. Yeah. Hey, everybody go. We can wait another 800 years for the bones to reappear at Tibet. Or I could take a team to Tibet without hellboy. Waller's back from Jakarta. Fine. Just draw straws for who goes where. Wonderful idea. The element of chance will let fate take a hand. Now, let's get started. I just have to round up a few things. We should leave within the hour. We? I mean, what's it been? Six, seven years? More like 15. I'm just sayin... Long time between missions. I don't know. Well, you don't have to. It's his decision. But we're just gonna have to watch him. Uh, watch your step, sir. Hellboy, I'm fine. You needn't worry. - Here you go, professor. - Thank you, Abraham. It's a trifle heavy. A few special tools. Just in case. So, heard trumboldt inherited his money. Guess if you're gonna inherit something, might as well be money. Miss sherman, you mind if I take a look at the assignment folder? - Call me Liz. - Call me Abe. Call me... Only if you really need me. Don't mind him. He gets crabbier every year. And he's older than he looks, so that's a lot of crabbiness. Somebody have garlic for lunch? Don't look at me. Now, about the case. There might be something here. I've done a little research. The Hampton house has some history to it. It was built by a millionaire eccentric. A real nut job. In the '20s, he played host to a pagan fertility cult. Who knows what went on? Looks like a fun crowd. There is some anecdotal evidence of hauntings. The usual stuff... Shadowy apparitions, flickering lights, swinging chandeliers, cold spots. Which usually means someone left a window open. Wanna tell us why we're really going? Not yet. Not until I'm sure. Are you sure you're ready? I'm quite fine, father. I'm just not used to the elevation like you mountain men. A moment's rest and I'll be ready to go. No, no. I meant the sun is setting. Would it not be better if we came back tomorrow? In the daylight. No, there is no time. She has Anna. We cannot wait. Not if the girl is to have a chance. We have dealt with vampires before, father. A stake through the heart, a clove of garlic on the tongue, and the villagers will sleep peacefully again. This one is clever, but tonight we send her to hell. Will we? You must have faith. Yes. Yes, of course. The power of god will protect us. Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I shall fear no... What was that? Some sort of birds. Big ones. Eagles. Hunting. Just like us. Keep that close, father. A vampire cannot bear the sight of a cross. Actually, it is the faith of the person holding it that gives it power. You'll be fine. May I help you? You're kidding, right? We are from the bureau for paranormal research and defense. I believe we're expected. Please come in. Wonderful. You're here. I'm Oliver trumboldt, and of course I already know who you are. Hellboy. Liz sherman. Abe sapien. Ah, professor broom, founding father of the bprd. I'm honored, sir. And, uh... Agent Sydney leach. Human metal detector. Pleased to meet you. Ah, yes. I'm sure that's very useful. I know all about you and your organization. And we've heard lots about you. Nice digs. Tell me you're not serious. I hope this will be suitable. Had them bring in some tables. Uh, plenty of power outlets. No, this is great. I'll set up. We'll try to stay out of your way. I'm impressed. The bureau actually sent their "a" team. - Hey. - It's for the brochure. We don't do photo ops. Right. Right. Maybe we can get some later. You and me out in front of the house? Maybe when the senator stops by. You know, I have seen some pretty strange things - since I bought this house. - Really? But, to tell the truth, I'm not so sure I believe in ghosts. Well, we hear that a lot. Thermal camera? Yeah. Wouldn't want to miss any cold spots. I'll get it. Ask me, this guy's just out to make a buck. You're most likely right. But that doesn't mean there isn't something happening in this house. I did what you asked. Leave me alone. Fool. Your work is not done. All right. Check the signal. It's decent. Wouldn't video cables cut down on interference, though? I haven't used them since a poltergeist - really? - Occupational hazard. Motion sensor goes down there. He was upside down for four hours. We found him after two, but that guy was such a jerk. Whoa, did you... Should I take a picture? - Oh, dang. - Of what? A closed door? Relax, Sydney. I'm sure you'll get plenty of thrills and chills before we're done here. Is that why professor broom is here? I don't know. It's not like we haven't faced scary stuff without him. Real scary stuff. Give me the sensor. Hellboy acts like he's gonna fall down and snap something. This thing doesn't have a battery in it. Hmm? Oh, I'm sorry. I've got some, uh, here. They're really close, aren't they? Oh, yeah. You know, not everybody thought keeping a demon that the Nazis summoned to win world war il was a good thing. Kill it! It's a demon come from hell to destroy us all. Aw, it looks more like a little boy. Ah. Hellboy. The professor raised him like a son on an air force base in new Mexico. That's got it. So, yeah, they're about as close as... What? The statues are crying. Hmm. Check for plumbing. Remember, trumboldt bought this place for tourists. It's not for tourists. Are you guys okay? Hellboy's not here. You know how he is with delicate equipment. - Anything wrong? - We've definitely got a ghost. Young woman. Eastern European. Sort of a peasant girl, if that makes any sense. Wait a minute. Temperature's dropping. Liz, I think we have more than one. I'll meet you back in the parlor. Come on. Somebody's in here. Show me what you got. I'm not gonna hurt ya unless you make me. So there is something going on here. Just how big is it? What did you see? Ghosts. Looking for help, I think. But they didn't want me. You can't stay, professor. I'm no longer director of field operations, but I'm not ready to retire. I'm not saying that. But you shouldn't be here. You're too... Old? I'm sorry I don't share your seemingly eternal youth. You grew so fast at first. In no time at all, you were too big to spank. Only 'cause the tail got in the way. So, everything is in place. So, do you think you might catch something tonight? We might get lucky. You too? This is amazing stuff. Amazing. It truly is. I don't know what to say. Yet he just keeps talking. Ah, here you go. Some snacks. Please, help yourselves. Going somewhere? I never stay in after dark. Okay. Let's cut the lights and see if anyone pops up. Huh. I think... I think I'm getting a reading. Oh, yeah. Here we go. Aah! - Which rooms are these? - All of them. They're everywhere. What the hell? Where'd they go? Professor. Are you okay? They were so frightened. I was right. This place is a goldmine. Not if we have to quarantine. Ah, well, let's not be too hasty. A few ghosts. That can't be that bad, can it? It is very bad. "Devil, witch, hell," and the names Marianna molnar and treszka bologh, the two witches who trained erzsebet ondrushko. Ah, the Hungarian blood countess. She thought bathing in the blood of young women would keep her young. Now we just go to the plastic surgeon. I've researched her. In fact, she'll be the central image of my marketing campaign. Sexy witch, spooky legend... It's the perfect thing for these people. It's not legend. It's fact. Those spirits were her victims. While she lived, erzsebet tortured and murdered 613 young women to feed her vanity. But her worst atrocities didn't happen until after she was dead. Vampire. But you destroyed her in 1939. So I thought. The point remains that altogether erzsebet is responsible for slaughtering over a thousand people. Yes, well, maybe not everything has to go in the brochure. It could be... someone is trying to bring back erzsebet. A hunch? If there's no body, they would need something intimately connected to her. Uh... huh? Yeah, that'd probably do it. Hecate, Greek goddess and queen of the witches. We may be dealing with something larger here. There are things in this world that modern man relegates to fairy tales and video games, but they are real. They are ugly. And they demand terrible payments for their gifts. No gifts here. These weren't cheap. They're all originals. Had 'em shipped from the ruins of erzsebet's castle. Cost quite a bit to restore, too. I would imagine they're still quite effective. It's wax. Just place it over there. She's very beautiful. Was very beautiful. And she knew it. Her vanity became her obsession. Instead of losing her beauty, she lost her soul. Hello? Is someone there? Aah! I know you are coming. You and that englishman. You should not. Who? You know. How? How could I invade the sanctity of this church? Please. You put your faith in wood and plaster. But where is your savior? It is a symbol of god's... My goddess gives me power and eternal beauty. Your god, what? False hope? Unanswered prayers? A better life after death? I have that too. You are the forsaken one, father. Yes, I'm serious. They shot straight through us. Must have been a hundred of 'em. I mean, Marcos, you realize I didn't anticipate any of this. Back out? Are you crazy? I'm doubling my ticket prices. Find me more houses like this. We'll franchise. Not sure what to do about the professor, though. Tends to be a bit morbid. Yeah. Takes all the fun out of the haunting. Sure, sure. I'll, uh, I'll think of something. Okay. Yeah, okay. I'll talk to you later. Bye. Everything's normal on video. Of course, we don't have cameras in every room. Not in the budget. Thank you, senator langsford. Whoa, whoa, whoa. I've got some kinda weird sounds. I can't pin it down. Great. Abe, why don't you and me go check things out? Maybe we can stir something up. - I'll go, too. - Sure. He'll protect us. Maybe you can keep an eye on the professor. You know, he's... Yeah, he's special to all of us. Come on, guys. What are we waiting for? It is time, sister. The stars are right. All ye gods of the groves, all ye gods of the night, be with us now. Let the triple goddess aid us. Favor us. Renew your servant. Feed flesh and sinew, bone and tooth. Return our priestess. Oh, you must be Anna. Come here, child, where we can see you. Do I know you? Oh, everyone in the village knows of the bride-to-be. So beautiful. Isn't she, sister? Yes, and so young. Like a kitten. But you can't stay out in the night with a couple of chattering old women. - It's not safe. - No, definitely not safe. We've seen your wedding gown. Oh, so beautiful. Hurry along now. Yes, my wedding gown. Excuse me then. I shouldn't keep Marie waiting. Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Hello, Marie. How does it look? Will it be beautiful? Marie? Oh, I'm sorry if I startled you. Here, let me take your coat so we can get started. What a lovely scent. Where is Marie? She is upstairs with the baby. It was not feeling well and took a turn for the worse. I said her place was at the baby's side and I would take care of you. But she said there was to be a final fitting. Are you a seamstress? Oh, one of the best, they say. Oh, my gown. I came here right from the opera. So young. Like a kitten. I had no time to change. But I could come back. Nonsense. How could you walk away from this? Oh... It is wonderful. How is the veil? Made of the finest lace. But I don't want to cover the rosy cheeks of such a young girl. You talk like an old woman. You couldn't be older than my sister. Your... older sister. - Yes. - Really? That old... I am so glad I came. I almost didn't. With the killings, those girls. You aren't afraid of the vampire? Father lupescu says no vampire would dare enter a village protected by his church. Then I have the priest to thank for your visit. I must return the favor. But he did meet with the englishman who is supposed to be an expert on such things as vampires. I am something of an expert myself. Aah! What was that? Sorry, professor. Just the equipment acting up. Go... go on back to sleep. Huh? The basement motion detector. Stay where you are. We'll check it out. About time. Something's in the torture chamber. Ah, it's just the old man. I... I am the one who sold these... Showpieces to Mr. trumboldt. I must go. I have work to do. What? Blood. That's blood. Where'd it come from? Over here. Okay, cover your eyes. Wait! Let me. Human metal detector, remember? At least he's not a psychic. I'm thinking maybe hidden doorway, and, uh, yep. Here it is. Trumboldt. He's been drained of his blood. I... I found it. Talk. I didn't want to. - Go on. - I... I can't. I saw you look at the professor. - What was that about? - Stop. He didn't do anything. You're the priest. I was... once... a priest. I thought you were staying back. Oh, like he would listen to me. He was with me when I last confronted erzsebet. - Are you all right? - Erzsebet? They are raising her. She will need the blood when she wakes. This is your chance to redeem yourself. Where is she? - In the grove. - Take us there. No. Please. That's all right. You've done enough for us. Thank you, father. Thank you. There is no redemption for you tonight. You have betrayed our queen. She still has work for you. Anna. Anna. Not worrying. You have a wedding to prepare for. But the terrible... Three women in one week. And the way they were found. Victims of some beast. A wolf, perhaps. Not a vampire. What vampire would dare trespass here? The church. This church is too strong. I walk these streets without fear. In the Bible, Joshua tells us be bold and strong. "Banish fear and doubt, for remember, the lord your god is with you wherever you go." And where you have to go is to Marie's for that final fitting of your wedding dress. Oh, yes, indeed. Goodbye, father. Thank you. Oh, thank you. Good afternoon, father lupescu. I hope I'm not interrupting. Not at all, professor broom. I have been looking forward to meeting you. I have to admit, when the others told me of your interest in this matter, I was... concerned. For my safety? Not precisely. Your profession. You work with spiritualists. Mediums. Attend séances. Is there not a danger of falling into step with the wrong element? Do you not fear being influenced by the forces of evil? Not if I remain strong in my beliefs. I know you doubt, but the trouble here is the work of a vampire, father. A vampire aligned with an ancient goddess who was given her incredible power. I will have no talk of false gods in this house of faith. I apologize, father. I meant no insult. We must all hold on to our faith. For in the end, it is the only thing that will save us. - What's that? - The old man was alone, wasn't he? We must get to the grove. Get to the grove. We'll be fine. You're starting to piss me off. A curious one, eh, sister? His cold blood is of no use to the priestess. True. But to us... Oh, yes. Now how to begin. Which one to use? This one. No, no, sister. This. Oh! Okay, one last dance. Missed all the fun, kid. Find Abe. I'm going for the professor and Liz. Find? Where? How? I don't know. Do your thing. Maybe he has a metal filling or something. Are you all right? I'm fine. Just caught on a branch. Liz, you must leave me. Erzsebet must be stopped. You have to interrupt the ritual. Go. I'll be fine. Maybe not. We must keep moving. Yeah. Stay close. If I could see them, I could... They're... leaving. Because they've done what they were meant to do. Hurry! We're too late. Erzsebet. Stand back. So young... She's too much for you. You'll burn. You. Let go of him. My goddess hecate, aid your servant. Hecate. Seen your statue. Aren't you missing a couple of heads? Why do you walk this lesser world? Mortals. They don't know you. We are greater beings than they could ever dream. Yeah? Well, I'm doin' just fine. Now, uh, I'm kinda busy. I gotta go. Why? To save them? They are nothing to us. Only a few remain that observe the old rituals. So I give them back the priestess, and they give me sacrifices of blood. Now accept what you are. Come and walk with me. Lady, I was gonna cut you some slack 'cause you're a major mythological figure, but that... that's crazy talk. Now leave me alone! There you are. Gotta go. Most intriguing, sister. Yes, sister. Let's cut some more. Harpies. Should have known. Liz! Liz! I'm okay. This time, I'm okay. The years have not been so kind to you. Nor to you. Ha. You're so frail. Age has turned you to glass. I pity you. And I you. Ah. Growing old is not the worst thing that could happen to a person, but you ceased to be a person long ago. No! What have you done? My contribution to your bath. No! Choose. Lady, you just don't get it. Damn. Can we do this some other time? You have made war against members of your own family and mine. Ancient spirits of air, old gods of graves and shadows, demons of hell. You're stained with the blood of your own kin. - Now come to me. - Oh, shut up. It is inevitable. Hecate, queen of the crossroads, terror of mortal men, let us worship... Sister? Jeez... Ow. Stop this. Come to me now. You do not belong in this world. Looks like your high priestess didn't do so well. This fight's over. Come on, come on. Work! Syd. Abe, where were you? I was trying to find you, but the cameras are all... - Where's hellboy? - Don't know. - But... - But what? I'm detecting metal. Lot of metal. Professor, look... Aah! Don't know you... Don't like you. Liz, no. Sorry! Sorry. Over here, ugly. Use it! Nice shot, kid. Thanks. I... oh! Was... was that the goddess? If hecate has come, this could be very bad. We've gotta do something. We can't. Only hellboy. - But we just can't... - It's almost dawn. Crap. Great. Don't you understand? We are not like others on this earth. This world's fine by me. Ugh, too long among humans. You have nearly lost yourself. It's over. No. We are gods of darkness. Here, have some sun. Crap. Stop this. Your destiny... Destiny is overrated. Broom, the car for the airport is here. Almost ready. You've never faced this sort of evil. There's no need for you to go alone. - If you can wait a week... - I cannot wait, Malcolm. Too many lives at stake. And I'm grateful they accepted the offer of my expertise. The transylvanian constabulary is very experienced, and I should expect strong support from the local church. I'll be fine. What... what is this? Hmm? It's old lemurian. It reads, "behold the right hand of doom." "And I looked down into the end of the world and saw the beast, and in his right hand was the key to the bottomless pit." There are those who think that power can be summoned and bent to their own ends. Well, they're fools. It's the apocalyptic thing. It brings the fire that will incinerate the world. Perhaps, but if evil finds purchase in such creatures as erzsebet, then we must have faith that good will choose an agent of its own. Until then, we fight in his stead. For that which causes us trials shall lead us to triumph. We must pass through darkness to reach the light. Professor? I've heard all the stories. It is the official position of the United States government that the lobster did not exist. He is a work of fiction. End of story.
