Now we need to talk about another type of violence. It's the trouble between supporters of Palmeiras and Corinthians yesterday afternoon. They fought outside the stadium, and the police had to intervene. Our team recorded tragic scenes of violence. And we've heard a Palmeiras supporter was stabbed to death yesterday in the fight with the other team. For fuck's sake, Capela! The road is badly painted. How am I going to see? What time is it? You're so lazy. Can't you see I'm driving? - It's 2:40 a.m. - Let's go to the morgue. C'mon, man. I'm starving. Let's have lunch. There's a lot of blood, Capela! Take us to the morgue! Is this the turkey car-wash? This one doesn't gobble anymore. It's cool. Gouvéa won't need to cut him open so much. - He's like swiss cheese. - He's a Palmeiras supporter. He's fumigated. Well, gentleman, I'm calling it a day. Sténio, wash this turkey well. -Just go, Capela. Go. Go because someone is doing overtime on your wife. - Hey! - Go! You had a fight because of soccer, right? How classy! Didn't you think about your family? Is this the hospital? This is the end of the line. You've gone to the other side. I'm sorry. What do you mean the other side, man? I'm going back to the bar. That stupid drunk wanted to screw with me. I'll mess him up. You're not going anywhere. It's over. So... Is this it? I have a family, man. Call them, man. I don't want to be buried as a hobo, for the love of God! Easy, easy, easy. Tell me. What's your name? Good morning, I'd like to speak to Ms. Edma. Ms. Edma, I'm calling about your husband, Mr. Valdecir. My name is Sténio. I work in the coroner's office. I call the power authority in the name of Jesus I demand the evil leave. I say, "Disease, go away! Rheumatism, go away!" Hilda, put it there for me, please. Hilda, could you give me one more, please? Today you have to read the sign. I get paid on Thursday. I'll pay you later. I want to improve the level of clients here. But for you, just for you, I'll allow it one last time. You don't need to say it like that. We open at 5:00, did you forget? Dad, I took 3 buses from the hospital. - Hi, Hilda. - Oi. Once in a while is okay, but you're always coming in late. You should go there sometime. I let Nora go, remember? I need you. You don't need to go there every day. It's not right leaving her so alone. For the love of God, she doesn't even know you're there. Lara. Here. Go. Hi, you. Hi. Where's the little hand on my head? Where is everyone? They're inside. Edson got in trouble. Sténio, get up from there. I told you not to lie there in your dirty work clothes! It stinks up the couch! Do you know what this is? This is kite wire. It cuts like a knife. Who's making it? Your son. To sell to the boys and steal kites. I almost had to go to the police station... What are you doing? You're grounded. Go inside! - Crap. - Boy, come back here. Do you see how they are? This one is rude, too. You see how they talk to me? You won't do anything? I'll do something. Later. Later. I'll do something. I'll talk to him in a while. I'll take a shower first. I'm tired. The smell stays. Everything smells bad. This smell from work... Let me see. - Go wash your hands. - Mom... Cica, go wash your hands. Smell it to see if you like it. When our love comes back time and again You're going to be late. I worked late yesterday. Leave me alone. I'm not in the mood today. When our love comes back time and again I'm going, Sténio. Finish sewing him up, give the man a bath and put him in the freezer. And try to get some rest, okay? Alright. See you tomorrow, Gouvéa. Did the police catch you? Relax, man. I'm not a cop. Where are you from? Cidade Tiradentes. The ROTA did me. What's your name? - Sujo. - Sujo? Do you work for Gilvan? -What Gilvan, man? I'm Jonas' brother. Why do you ask? Relax, dude. I see a lot of dead crooks here. You did time, right? How do you know? This tattoo here. It says, "CDP is 13." You know too much. Who's been talking to you? Tchaco, Tocha, Matheus. These guys died in a shooting with the police. But me... I was backstabbed. Someone rat on you? It was Dentinho. Bastard. Bro, can you help me out at Divineia? For the love of God. My brother is death personified. He'll give that fucker Dentinho what he deserves. No way. If I tell them what you tell me, bad things can happen. You're the last voice I'm hearing before Satan. - Did you know? - Are you crazy, bro? Bite your tongue. I killed my dad. Me and Jonas. That fucking old man. He used to hit our mother. We stabbed him three times in the chest. And threw him off a bridge in Registro. Only we and God know. God doesn't forgive those who Kill their families. C'mon, mister. You can come in. Careful not to rip my couch on that hook on the wall! The entrance is on the side. Come this way. What the fuck? What the hell? Wait... Who bought that? Man, leave the couch there. -No, mister. Take it in. Who bought that, Odete? -I did. You wouldn't. I work hard to pay rent, and you buy this in secret? - I paid with my work. - What work, Odete? The sweets I help Doraci make! That's a lot of sweets to pay for this fucking couch. - Take the couch in. - Wait, wait. - It's an installment plan. - An installment plan? - I'm going to end up paying! - What are you paying, Sténio?? I've had it with you. I've really had it with you. Your life doesn't improve. You don't treat me well. And your smell stinks up my house. You're disgusting. I'm disgusted by you. Disgusted by you. Let's go, mister. Take the couch in. Check the IV. Larissa, clean the catheter. Take care of the access. Bring the monitor. Lara... Did something happen? She had a cardiac arrest. We're taking her to the ICU. - C'mon, c'mon. - Go blow, go blow. Fucking stupid joke, Valdir. Don't you have anything better to do? And you, Capela? Did you forget to take your pill? Or did you jerk off in the bathroom? - Take your hands off me! - Stop it! What the fuck, man? It was just a joke. - Can't you take a joke? - What kind of joke is that? You liked it, right? You had to see your face when you saw my cock, Sténio. Sténio... Do I know you, asshole? Vila Gustavo in the house, brother! Fuck, right on my shift! Sténio, you're talking to the dead now? Dude, I'm going to piss in your ear. - What did you do? - I was stealing hearts. From other people's girls. When you mess around, you go to the other side early. - I feel sorry for your mother. - Have you no respect, crook? Crook? All the crooks end up on this gurney. - Yeah? - I have to stitch you up later. Do you know why? Because you're a loser. Unlike me, who enjoyed life the way God wanted, better than you. While you're washing dead people, your wife is cheating on you, boy. What did you say? Hey, Sténio. - Is everything ready? - I just need to wash the table. Hurry up then. I'm getting a coffee. What was that, Carlao? You're talking about my wife! Now you're mad, right, loser? You should take it out on the right guy. I doubt you'll get tough like this with Jaime. - Jaime from the store?? - That's him, man. You know nothing about women, Sténio. Don't you notice her clothes? Who do you think pays for that? Shut up! Sténio! Sténio! Come back, Sténio! When we got there, we saw three boys on the ground. It was a mess. Wow... And the parents? - A bunch of bums. - One second. Ten reals. I have no money, Mr. Jaime. Can I pay you tomorrow? I can't let you. You haven't paid what you owe me. You're really doing this to me, Mr. Jaime? My store is not a cachaca welfare station. Is everything okay, Mr. Jaime? Don't you have anything? A check, a watch, a cell phone? Let me check this. You need to raise the level, Sténio. She's going to get some bread for breakfast. My family has always given me self-esteem and there was always a political thinking in the places I went. We need to understand the context we live in and how we can contribute to improve the situation. My family was crucial to me. They were affectionate and gave me self-esteem. I was watching that. Put it back. Go watch TV in the bedroom. What is this? Why are you sitting on the floor? I want to watch the news. It's my house. Okay... You want to watch the news. It's your house. Then you sit here watching the news. I'm going to the bedroom to forget you exist. Why don't you cook for the kids and take them to school? Since it's your house. ...when heavily armed men got there and started shooting. The battle was between two rival gangs who fight for drug traffic control in this area. The group led by Gilvan Barreiro and the rival gang, commanded by Jonas Cravo. The reason seems to be revenge for the death of Jonas' brother, Manuel Cravo, Sujo. Sujo... The area is under... Hey, bro. I want to talk to Jonas. I don't know any Jonas. I know who ratted on Sujo. Thank you. I'm loving, you don't like it. I do whatever. You don't like it. Don't you answer your phone anymore? Do you want 6 loaves of bread? - I didn't see my phone. - You haven't seen it all day? - Not here. - This is weird. What's up? Don't touch that! - We'll talk later. - What time? - Hi, Edson. - Hi, Lara. - In the corner at 8pm. - Sharp. -Okay! Go away. I went to your school, too. Let's go. No, not that. Disgusting! Nothing with sugar. Let's go, let's go. What? What are you looking at? This is where I want to live. In house number 80. This is the guy, boss. Where did you know Sujo from? I did time with him in CDP. I'm Sténio. - He never mentioned you. - No? He talked about you a lot. He'd say Jonas was the only real daredevil he knew in the East Zone. Dentinho, go get a beer and nice bunch of weed for our guest. We're going to talk. Tell me. What do you know? Who ratted on my brother to the ROTA? I have a friend who works in the morgue. He's friends with the pigs. He told me when the ROTA delivered Sujo's body there. He told me who the rat was. Tell me. It's a guy from Vila Gustavo. Vila Gustavo? Yeah. He had some mess with Sujo. His name is Jaime. He has a bakery on the corner of Juarez Dagoberto. Are you sure? One hundred percent. I'm a crook, man. But I'm not a psychopath. You should know that anyone who tricks me doesn't live. With all due respect, to do what you and Sujo did to defend and protect your mom, you can only be an honored and correct guy. That was between me and Sujo! Sujo was my brother. This rat from the store deserves to die like your deceased father. Stabbed three times in the chest and thrown from the bridge. You said it, so it's an order. Go with him. What is it? What is it? Nothing. Seeing your kids' names isn't easy. And taking the kids to the store was a low blow. Two, three. Go with God, Carlao. Talk to me, Carlao. You're fucked, Sténio. Why did you do this shit? A dead man's secret is a death secret, Sténio. Now you're marked, brother. - Marked? - What? No, no... Help me with the lid. Boss, the rat is here. Follow him. Boss, there's a woman with him. Follow him. Do you need anything? Yes. Yes, I do. I need peace and quiet. I need two babysitters, one for each kid. Odete... We need to slow it down. The vibe is weird. I think Sténio knows everything. What are you talking about, Jaime? He went to the store and made a scene there. He wanted to pay later. The way he looked at me... I'm sure he knows about everything. Oh, no. No, Jaime, don't do this to me. My life is a disgrace. I can't, Odete. Do me a favor? Give him his phone back... - I want him dead! - Stop that! I'll divorce him... What is this? Oh my God! - Easy, easy! - Get out, motherfucker! - Easy, mister. - I'm coming out. Easy. - Jesus! - On your knees! For the love of God, take that gun out of my head. Do you know why you're going to die? - Jaime, right? - Mister, put that gun down! Shut up! Shut up! I'm Sujo's brother, asshole! -Who? You know who, you stupid rat. My brother died because of you. You're going to the same place. You messed with the devil! Please, I don't know your brother. Put that gun away, for the love of God. You want me to put it away? I'll do it. I don't want to use it. This is how my brother died. Just like this, kneeling in front of the ROTA. I don't know your brother. You can take the car. The car? I don't want the car! I want something else. I want to see the street drink your blood. My God... You murderer! You coward! Go home, woman. Forget our faces. Go home. The police. They called the cops on you! You're going down! The cops will arrest you! Jonas, wrap it up. The police are coming! - Shut up, man! - Jonas? You murderer! Your name is Jonas! They'll catch you! You're all going down! Let's go, boss. Sténio... My God, Sténio! Something tragic happened! It's Odete, Sténio! Odete. Odete! Get out of the way! Move! Out of the way! Odete! Move! Out of the way! Odete! Move! Move! Odete! Odete! Odete... - It's my wife! - Easy... What did they do to you? My son! Don't let him see me like this! Sténio, for the love of God, get him out of here. My son... Don't let him through. Dad, Dad... Mom! Mom! Mom... - Easy, son. - It's my mom, Dad! Dad! It's my mom! So you can hear me? How? I always have. I've always talked with dead people. With you, with Carlao, who ended up here. I talk with the dead. I can't explain it. Do the children know about me? Look, Sténio... I was getting up the courage to tell you about Jaime. But the truth was quicker than your respect. But I won't die like you. I'm not going to be Vila Gustavo's loser. - No one knew, Sténio. - Now everyone knows. But I had the last laugh. I sent the bastard to burn in the fire of hell. I just didn't know you'd go down with him. Sténio... You're not a part of this, right? -What do you think? You bastard! Motherfucker! Maybe now you'll respect me, Odete. How did you dare to have the mother of your children killed? They'll never forgive you. I'll never forgive you. But I forgive you. Five little stones. One for each letter of your name. You're going under the dirt, Odete. Mine. What are you doing? Take this off me! Sténio. Sténio, come back here! Sténio, come back here! Come back, Sténio! Good afternoon. Are you this boy's father? What a shame, Edson... What a shame. Is this why I work every night stitching up bodies? For my son to steal from a market? Come home as a criminal? You wanted me to be a loser at school? You're a crook then? Why are you laughing? Edson, come back. I'm talking to you, Edson! Edson! Edson! Edson, open this door! Open this door, Edson! - What's up, Gouvéa? - Hey, Silvinho. It's bad, huh? It's intense, my man. Come see. Sténio, grab us some masks. - Where are the bodies? - There. For fuck's sake... At this time of night... Give us a light. By the look of them, they've been rotting for a while, Fuck... Let's set it up, Sténio. It's not going to be easy. Dad? Dad? - It's nothing. Just sleep. - Are you sure it wasn't dad? Come on! Come on! - Open it! Come on! - Hang on! Hang on! Hang on! This is weird. Shine a light here, Sténio. Look at this. This isn't normal. Do you see? It looks like an animal bite. They've been in the woods for a long time. Slow down with your theory. If it's an animal bite, how come it's only bitten on the inside? There's nothing on the skin. There are no teeth marks on the outside. The bitch killed us both. But it should have been three. You were supposed to be the first one. Give me the spacer, Sténio. We Killed two innocent people because of you. The devil came back fierce, you ass. What the hell is that? What is it, Sténio? Cica! Edson! What are you doing here? - Your kids... - Where are they? They're with me. It's okay. They said someone got in here. Do they stay alone at night? Let's go get them? Do you need any help? No, thanks. We'll be okay. We'll be okay. Gouvéa, there are bodies everywhere. In the hall, the kitchen, even in the bathroom! Okay, but... Gouvéa, it's up to God then. We need to put bodies on the floor. We have more coming. - You're joking. - No, there was another landslide. Let's do this. Put the gurney there. Come on, Capela. How are we going to move? -I don't know, man! Sténio, you still haven't finished here? Wait, man! Give me a break! I haven't gotten there yet. Here, here. You can put them back here. Sténio, stop what you're doing and come help me. - Gouvéa, I can't now. - What do you mean? - I'm cleaning here! - What? - There's no more space. - I don't know... - We need to find a way. - I told you I don't know! Fucking handle it! Sténio! C'mon, Sténio. Are you deaf? Sténio! Sténio! Sténio. - What happened? - The guy is cold! Were you in there, man? Capela, go grab something. -Who was here? Easy, easy. There was no one here. - Fuck, Capela, move! - I'm going! Go! Stay here. Good morning. - Jesus... - Dad! You're burning up. He has a fever. Help me, Edson. Let's take him to the bedroom. Here. I'm taking the kids to eat. -You don't have to. Sténio, your children don't want to be alone anymore. They came to my house again. -Don't worry. My dad didn't wear cologne. My mom only used good perfumes. Why are you saying that? Odete's perfume. When my mom had the stroke, I took care of the house. That's when the smell started. In his clothes. After I smelled it, everything went downhill. They killed my dad. I found out I have debts. I don't have the store anymore. I might even lose my house. Okay... I'm fucked, you're fucked. Now what? I'm not my dad. I didn't harm anyone. What are you going to do now? I'll handle it. I'll get a job. You asked me if I needed help with the children. The person is looking for comfort, looking for spiritual peace... Cica. Cica, Cica! My God! Cica! Cica. My God... The power of prayer is stronger. The power of God has strength. We'll show this. Just stay calm. Well done. I want to know who's in there. Who's in there? I don't want to hear about small entities. You just remain calm. I like raw meat! And I'm going to destroy her life! Do you see, church, what evil can do? This kind of evil can be at your house. But we're here expurgating and cleansing. We're clearing out this place. When our love comes back again and again What is it? What are you looking at? They found this in a ditch in Jardim Robru. With no head or fingerprints to identify it. The police think he's a judge the criminals wanted dead. Gouvéa said it was a priority. This body wasn't like this. -What do you mean? Valdir, look at this. What time did it come in? About 3 hours ago. I helped them bring it. The body wasn't like that. What's going on? Valdir said the body didn't arrive like this. - It didn't. - The guy's spine was removed. The body didn't come in like this. I received the body. You want to see? Look, Gouvéa. Look at the back. It wasn't like this. It's not possible. Look at this one. Did anyone else come in here? -No. Well... This doesn't make any sense. Let's find it. Let's go. Fuck... Listen. This body was your responsibility. I'm not dealing with the police, okay? Do what you have to do, but fucking find it. It can't have been Cica. But she was holding this. A child couldn't reach this high. I don't wear lipstick. Lara! I'm sorry. I wasn't accusing you. It's okay. I just need to rest. Hi, sweetie. You're up? Did you have breakfast? Your wife is buried the way we left her, Sténio. I think someone moved her body, Gideao. When I buried her, she was wearing our wedding ring. And now someone left it at my door. If you're so sure, you need to go to the police. No, Gideao. I'm desperate. I don't want to talk to the police. Help me out. I need to see her body. Forget that, Sténio. Go home. Sténio. Tonight the Umbanda guys are coming to do an offering. I'll be with them. I can take them far away from her grave. If you want to risk it, do it alone, alright? You wanted to talk to me, Odete? You're sending me messages. I'm here. Talk to me. Odete... I know I went too far. But Cica and Edson don't deserve this. Who are you to say who deserves what? You want forgiveness? How can I forgive you? Huh, Sténio? Tell me. Leave me alone. You thought I was so beautiful... Look what's left of me and ask for forgiveness. Over there, you guys! Sténio! Wake up, Sténio! Sténio, breathe! Breathe, Sténio! You're fucked, Sténio. How did you do this shit? - Dad! - Hi, sweetie. - What happened, Sténio? - We'll talk later. My God, you're badly hurt. - Did the police hit you? - No, sweetie. Daddy had a problem, but it's over now. Why were you in the police car? I'll explain later. I'll take a shower and... No! Tell me now! Why can you arrive in the police car and I can't? You called me a criminal. - Don't say that. - He's right. - Listen, son... - Fuck that! Everyone's saying mom was a whore. Shut up. Besides being a son of a bitch, I'm a son of a criminal! Edson... Edson, are you hurt? Are you okay? Easy. It's okay. I'll help you get up. Edson. The kids are sleeping. I'm leaving, okay? Lara. I didn't mean to hurt Edson, okay? I understand you lost it, that you're suffering, but so are your kids. I know. It seems like I don't, but I know. - Is anyone after you? - No, no. I just want to know if I should worry about being here. I'm worried about the kids. I'll take care of you. - Good night. - Good night. I wanted you to handle food and drinks. It's Saturday at 3:30pm. So what if it's the day after tomorrow, Doraci? I want cake, brigadeiro, coxinha and everything. Oh, and 11 candles, too. Okay then. Okay. Thank you. Thanks, thanks. Let me see this here. Hand this out at school. Saturday, 3:30pm. It's your birthday. Let's celebrate and have a party. - My birthday is in September. - I know. We're anticipating it. We're having a party on Saturday. Cica! Cica! Here. Cica, here you go. What's this? A party on Saturday. It's Batata's birthday. - But his birthday... - I already told him. But you two are so bummed about it! Give it here. I'll hand them out. I'll invite people. Get ready. On Saturday, we'll have a ball. We're gonna rock it. Let me call everyone. - Lara. - Thank you! Cica, Cica! Lara! Where's Edson? - Where's Edson? - Call him. Edson! Edson! Come here! Bring the boys! Okay! Edson! Is he coming? Look! - Thanks! - You wanted that, right? There you go! Get off! Open it! Let's assemble it together. What's wrong, son? What did you do, Sténio? Son, I didn't know about this. Son! Son! Excuse me, excuse me. Capela. - Can I talk to you? - Go ahead. If I gave you some money, would you get me some things? Things? What things? - Pills. - What's up? I don't understand it. Gouvéa is the doctor. Why are you asking me? Fuck it, Capela. Do you think I never looked in the glove compartment? The water is rising, right? That's the night shift. The guy's mind gets screwed up. I need something to get wired. I'm saying things, forgetting things... Yes, I know. Stupid things, right? Like leaving a body part in a gift box. Huh? Valdir told me. The pill I should give you is a slap on the face. You have no idea what I'm going through. You know what I think? You shouldn't work here anymore. Ouch! Odete! Odete! Odete, get out of there! Cica! Edson! Ouch! Dad? - Dad! - Cica! Kite wire! Kite wire! Kite wire! Kite wire! Dad? I'm already fine. I cut myself, but it's okay now. It's okay now. Thank God, right? I swear I didn't mean any harm. I'm your father! Can't you talk to me? - Edson! - Excuse me. - I'm sorry... - Let them be, Sténio. It's better. They're scared. It's unfair. I didn't want them to get hurt. I didn't want them to get cut. What are you talking about? I was trying to protect them. But she... - How does she do this? - She? Odete. What did she do? What did Odete do? Did you do that? I think you're very stressed. You're right. Odete's dead. I'm not... I'm not keeping it together. Sténio, you need to be organized. I'm trying! I'm taking care of myself! Okay. So calm down. Shit. Sténio. Sténio! Sténio. Sténio. Sténio. Odete? Odete, what can I do? What do you want? Do you want me to put a bullet through my head? - If Cica and Edson... - That girl in my house. I want you to bleed her for me. Why? I made the mistakes. If it's blood you want... My kids will know who you are. Kill her and I'll go away. If you don't kill her, I'll take my children. I can't. No? You can't, Sténio? Haven't you killed already? Murderer... Lara. Sténio... Don't do that. What about the kids? They're inside. Sit down. What's going on? Nothing, for now. But I think it's going to happen. You're scaring me. I don't want you to be scared of me. You're right. I need to pull myself together. Those things you said about Odete... I don't believe in that. I believe in God. Those who believe in God know the devil exists, too. You're being oppressed. Let me take you to my church. My minister can help you. If you really want to help me, take Cica and Edson out of the house for a few days. There's a shadow in my way. Only I can deal with it. Take the kids to your house, please. Cica. Cica, wake up. Come. - What is it? - Over there. Open it. It's cool. Edson? Lara! Lara! - Cica? - Lara! - Lara! - Cica! Cica! Grab Cica! Cica! Look at me! Look at me, Cica! Wake up! Dad! Come in. Hello. Hi, Doctor. What's wrong? I'm here, I'm here. I'm sorry. Yes. I'm on my way to the hospital. Thank you. Lara. I need to go to the hospital. I want my daughter far away from you. On this side, you are damned. And your wife won't rest until you shed blood. I'm sorry. Your disgrace is already affecting your kids. But it won't come near my daughter. Stay away from her. Do you promise? Excuse me. - Good morning. - Good morning. I'm from the department that deals with the deceased. I need to talk to you to explain the release of the body. I swear. I'm not a murderer. You have to erase this whore's marks. Nothing that was Odete's can be left behind. Nothing that reminds of here. Nothing she can cling to. Get rid of it all. Go! A guy from Vila Gustavo. He had a mess with Sujo. His name is Jaime. This rat from the store deserves to die like your deceased father. Stabbed three times in the chest and thrown off a bridge. Good night. Son, Son! Where's Lara? Where's Lara? Isn't she in your room? No. Your call is being forwarded... Did Lara leave, Dad? Can't you begin the search? No... 24 hours? What if she's in danger? Please, make this urgent. Okay, okay, okay... I'll call tomorrow. Do you know if she has a family we can call? I'll get the papers to begin the process. Lara. Talk to me. Sténio? What happened? Where am I? You're in the morgue, lady. Hold her tongue! Hold her fucking tongue! So? She's stable. We checked her temperature, her blood pressure... She's going to be okay. She almost died. Shouldn't she go to the hospital? Right. We took a look at Valdir's report. You can look, if you want. I think he filled it out wrong. It says she came in with respiratory failure, no heartbeat, a temperature of 937... She was supposed to be dead. Sténio, this girl had a catalepsy. It's rare, but it happens. Now there's nothing we can do. Better take her home. Let's go. Thank you. There's a sandwich here. There's juice in the fridge...
