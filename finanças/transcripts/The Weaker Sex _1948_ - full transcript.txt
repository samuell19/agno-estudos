[roaring] [music playing] [upbeat music playing] All right. On the screeching cab, please. Both sides on. [whistling] [vacuum running] [SINGING] [inaudible] but who's to answer? For how the ghost of you clings, clings, clings. These foolish things remind me of you. A cigarette that bears a lipstick's tracers. An airline ticket to romantic places. [knocking] But still my heart has wings, wings, these foolish things-- Remind me of you. I'm so sorry. The-- the bell doesn't work. I'm from the domestic agency. Oh, well, how are you Mrs-- come in. Do come in. Gaye is the name. I beg your pardon. Gaye. Mrs. Gaye with an E. I'm delighted to see you. Come this way, won't you? [inaudible] Do sit down, won't you? [train screeching] That bread would be all the better for being put down. [laughs] Oh, yes. You're Mrs. Dacre's husband, I presume? No, no, we're not married. I mean, I'm not married and she's a widow. My name is Radcliffe. Oh. I was a friend of her late husband, and she kindly consented to billet me here. Her old house in London was bombed, and so she moved down here to look after her two daughters who are in the Wrens. That makes four in family, as you might say. Quite, quite. But except for Mrs. Dacre, we're hardly in a-- [footsteps] I was just coming to him. He's billeted here too, from the Signals Corps down the road, but only temporarily of course. Excellent chap. Now it's five. And who are them? Oh, that is Mrs. Dacre's son Benjie, but he's at sea. That's the eldest daughter's husband. He's in the same ship. So of course he's at sea too. Are you quite sure? Well, of course I am. We haven't seen either of them for over three months, and it may be far longer than that before we see them again. And how many more are there to come? Well no more, really. That's the lot. Do you stack overnight? Well I-- Do you stack up overnight? No, I'm quite sure we don't. At least, I don't remember hearing that we ever did that. No, only the [inaudible] leaves the [inaudible] till the following morning when they've someone coming in. Oh, I see what you mean. No, no, nothing like that. No, we all wash up after every meal, except breakfast when we haven't the time. I'm afraid Mrs. Dacre has to do that by herself. She's down at the canteen at the moment. Am I about to see the kitchen? But of course. [thud] Roddy! RODDY: Help. What a mess. GEOFFREY RADCLIFFE: Come this way, Mrs. Gaye. Quickly. Here she comes. Sorry, sir. Oatmeal. Well, if you have to spill it at all, sir, do it tidily. This is Sergeant McIntyre. Mrs. Gaye. Oh, how are you, Mrs. Gaye? And this is Wren Wiland, the married daughter. I do you hope you're coming to help us. Well-- [sniffs] there's summat caught on in that pan. Goodness. You see it's a very pleasant kitchen. What's this here for? MRS. GAYE: Geoffrey! Oh dear. You've come on the wrong morning. We're not like this as a rule, honestly we're not, but it's mother's night at the canteen and-- MARTHA DACRE: Good morning. Good morning. - Ah, good morning, Mrs. Dacre. - Good morning. - You going down to the bus? - Yes. - I'll carry your bag for you. - That's very kind of you. Ah yeah. Came down at a special this morning to catch you over what you said last night. Oh? What did I say? About chickens going on-- why don't you wrap that around your neck! About chickens going off the market. Oh yes, yes, I haven't been able to get one for ages. Where do they all go to? All the posh hotels or the black market. Well, I can't afford either of them, though I sometimes wish I knew where this black market operates. Thank you so much for carrying this. That's all right. Here, would you take this? You mean it's for me? Yes. It's a little token of our appreciation for all you're doing for us back here. Well, I can't just take it. The old man's got plenty more in the backyard. Does he know about this? Course he does. I'd simply love to have it. My youngest daughter is coming home tonight. It would be wonderful to give her chicken for supper. You have to let me pay for it. - Oh, no, no, no. That's all right. - Oh yes, yes. I know being on leave's expensive these days. It's true. Let me see. I think I paid 15 shillings for the last one I had. Here's my bus and I haven't got any change. Thank you very much. Thank you. Well, I might as well start tomorrow if I'm coming at all and if that suits. Admirably, admirably. It'll be such a pleasant surprise to Mrs. Dacre. Mrs. Gaye, I could hug you. That's not necessary. Thank you very much. Though mind you, one of the reasons I'm coming at all is that if I didn't, the thought of you in your uniform with that [inaudible] Oh, and there is just one thing more and I best mention it now. Yes? I don't care for loving jokes made about my name. Well, of course not. There's no of course about it. I've had plenty in my time. I'm not exactly jolly in the ordinary way, though mind you I can enjoy a good laugh in its place as well as the next. Yes, yes, I'm sure. And I can assure you, Mrs. Gaye, that no one here will be allowed to be funny about your name. The name wasn't the only mistake I made when I married Gaye. Well, good morning to you and I hope as we suits each other. [children giggling] Won't be any left by the time we get there. Some have been here all night. Even if there are any, they'll be the wrong size, and in any case, they won't wear. Yes, but they'll be lovely just to look at. I mean, pure silk. WOMAN IN LINE 1: Look at that. No wonder we can't get any poultry. WOMAN IN LINE 2: It's an absolute disgrace. And a pretty penny they'll make out of them too. WOMAN IN LINE 1: People will pay anything nowadays and ask no questions, and still call themselves honest. WOMAN IN LINE 2: That's right. Common sense ought to tell them you don't buy hens off soldiers. I don't think I'll wait. Look. Stolen. What? I've had to come home miles around to avoid main streets and policemen. My dear girl, what do you mean? Would you buy a chicken from a soldier? What about a drop of brandy? No, no, I'm quite all right, really. Look, there it is-- headlines. He had such a pleasant face. I could have sworn he was honest. This is pretty serious. Geoffrey, what am I to do? You know what you ought to do. Take it to the police. Then they keep the hen, wouldn't they? Most certainly if it was stolen. But unless he had an airplane, he could hardly pinch it in Yorkshire last night and sell it to you here this morning, could he? What a woman. Geoffrey, what would I do without you? I must be off. Well, I've never dressed one of these from scratch, but I suppose I can learn. Where's my dispatch case? If only people would leave things-- Oh, where? Where you left it last night. Oh, thanks. I apologize. Oh, good gracious, I nearly forgot. What? I've got you a woman. --To clean and things, but only for three mornings a week. Geoffrey, you're not delirious. No, no, of course not. Now, where's my pipe? Oh, you clever man. How wonderful. Oh my dear, what would I do without you? By the way, her name is Mrs. Gaye. Mrs. Gaye. I'll remember. It's a perfectly ordinary name. Rather jolly one. No, no, just perfectly ordinary Martha. Yes, well, why get so worked up about it? Oh, no reason really. I just-- well, bye. What about tonight? It's on the slate. I'll be back in time for Lolly's arrival I hope. [music playing] MARTHA DACRE: Oh dear. Morning, Mrs. Dacre. I'm trying for the bus. Good morning. It was just-- I know, the chop. I'll collect it for you. If you don't mind. Well, when I'm going to eat it I don't know. I'm out at lunch today and tomorrow, and this new shift is 2:00 till 11:00 at night. Oh my dear. Fortunately two of my workmates, Alf and Gladys, they both live in this direction. So we can cycle home together. I'll have it for breakfast and feel like Henry VIII. Aren't they sweet? Why don't you have Angoras? These are for eating. But you don't eat them, do you? Well, Commander Radcliffe bought them to help out with the rations, but somehow I just can't. Oh, there you are. Hello Harriet. You don't know my sister, Harriet Lessing. Monica Maling. - How do you do? How do you do? Well, if you'll excuse me, I'd better be going. Thank you very much and bless you. Her husband's abroad and she has just gone into a factory. Now, tell me what you've come about. If it's heavy or not on the direct bus route, it simply can't be done. It's not far off the bus route and there's nothing at all to carry. I want to book a hair appointment. And as you know, ringing up is absolutely hopeless. If you're in town, Thornton's isn't far out of your way. Only about three-quarters of a mile. Makes a nice walk when you've nothing better to do. But after this, I'm going to make some marmalade and then I'm going to get some sleep. Marmalade? Yes, out of two orange skins, some lemon essence, some damp sugar that's gone into a hard lump, and a great deal of faith. After that-- All right, all right. Don't bother about it. I only asked. You know, you're losing your sense of humor. No. Only my temper a little. I apologize. I've been at the canteen all night and I'm rather tired. Well, why wash the morning after your canteen night? Because it's necessary. Did you think it was for fun? No, but I do think it's bad organization. Be careful, Harriet. I told you I'm tired. Well, so am I. I didn't get home myself until 10:00 o'clock last night. Very late. All the same, I envy you. Envy me? Well, in that case, why didn't you do a proper job when war broke out? Why didn't you do what I did? I should have liked to have done what you did, but my conscience wouldn't let me. Oh, I'm afraid we'll never agree about the meaning of a proper job. And as you keep harping on the idea that my work is simple. I am in charge of 50 persons. With several underlings to help you, while I'm in sole charge of [inaudible] You're not in charge of them. Aren't I? I'd like to know what you call it then. The conceit of some of you women just because you're dressed in khaki. Martha. Do you clear out two grates and relay two fires by 7:00 AM? That's beside the point. Do you do the washing and mending and ironing for five people and yourself each week? Do you cook every meal for five people, clear away every meal, wash up after every meal night after night, day after day, and often in the middle of the night? No, you don't. Nor do you have to pick those revolting little bits of rubbish out of that disgusting little grating in the scullery sink. Look at your hands and look at mine. I don't have to pick up silk stockings nowadays. My hands act as magnets. If you've quite finished-- No, I haven't. I was just drawing a new breath. You sit at an office desk in clothes provided without coupons being regaled by constant cups of tea, made and brought to you by an orderly who will be doing a far better job if she helped me scrub out the scullery. There, I've said it and I feel better. It's no good saying I'm sorry, because I'm not. Well, I hope you've enjoyed yourself. Just because you've got a louder voice than I have I haven't been able to get a word in edge-wise. The floor is yours. Thank you. I do not want it. I should just like to point out that your work is at least done in your own time and in your own home. And-- RODDY: Mrs. Dacre! I'm off, Mrs. Dacre. Good morning, Mrs. Lessing. - Morning. Our unit's moving out this morning. So I've just come back to pack my things and say goodbye. Oh, my dear boy. I'd like to say, well, I just don't know how to thank you for everything. - Nonsense. We've loved having you here. Can I help you to pack? No, I can do it. Well, goodbye. I'll come and see you off. Oh, good gracious, his pants. Roddy! Oh, thanks. They're not dry. That's all right. Better cut him some sandwiches. Can I help? I'm afraid I know what this means. So do I. [music playing] Some sandwiches. You may need them. Oh, thank you. Lolly will be sorry to miss you. Well, as a matter of fact, I've left a note for her in her room. I'll see that she gets it. Well, goodbye and I only hope you know what I'm quite incapable of saying. I do. Goodbye. Come back safely and soon. Goodbye, Mrs. Lessing. Good luck. [music intensifies] I shall miss Roddy. Pity he didn't see Lolly, though I gather they're not on quite the terms they used to be. He's quite the steadiest person she's ever seemed to like. Oh, wow, I must be going. Oh-- I'll-- I'll make that hair appointment for you. Thanks, if you can. I wish the wretched wind would drop. It's maddening being in a shore job at a time like this. It's a very important job and you know it. There, as good as new. Your one and only respectable pair. Thank you. Geoffrey, will you do something for me? Test these. I don't think I dare. What do you mean, unscrew the tops? That's right. You be careful. [grunts] Now, lift them by the glass lid, only do be careful. Oh, I don't look. It works. No, no, that's enough. Don't overdo it. [laughs] You haven't got the neck. No, no, don't say it. Now let's do the others quickly. That's all right. You know, Martha, you're unique. Look. Now, don't say anything, but pray. Oh well. Three out of six isn't bad. I've never done them before. I'll re-bottle those in the morning. Now, why am I unique? Well, I-- I've never had a wonderful, genuinely platonic friendship with a woman before. It's a new experience. You talk as if you'd gone through life being hotly pursued by designing females. I'm getting a new light on your character. I-- I didn't mean that. What I meant was there's no other woman in the world-- LOLLY: Hello, everyone. Lolly! Mommy! Goodness, child, you're throttling me. Hello, Geoffrey, my sweet. That is no way to address a senior officer. It's so lovely to be home. I say, isn't everything exciting? All the craft in the harbor, and the train was packed with troops. When's it going to be, Geoffrey? Shh, Lolly. Waiting for you, young woman. You've paid the taxi, I suppose? Well, I hadn't any change. [laughs] Fancy. What a heavenly smell. MARTHA: There's a treat for you. Hurry up. It's all ready. Lolly, Roddy's gone. Gone? His unit was moved today. There's a note for you in your room. [music playing] Fresh air and the moon. Let's go look at the sea. I've heard all this out with myself and I know I'm right. I'll be going away any day now. I don't know when I'll come back, or even if I'll come back. A chap in that position has no right to tie a girl down. How thoughtful. You'd be free too, of course, wouldn't you? Well, now that's settled, I'm going back to the dance. Are you? I will. [orchestral music playing] Signal for you, sir. Thank you. I slept and I dreamed that life was beauty. I woke and found that life was duty. I'm terribly sorry, Martha. I'll get my coat. Well, I suppose I-- Wait. Mother, if you've got a message for Benjie, I might be able to deliver it. What? Hush, be quiet. I'm not supposed to know. Do you mean the Benevolent? Shh, don't say it. It's some minor repair. She's only in for an hour or so. Marjorie heard in the staff office and gave me the drop. She knew about Nigel and Benjie of course. Oh dear. Why aren't I in the WRNS too? Let me see. Give Benjie my love and tell him-- tell him that now he's a staff lieutenant, he must keep his nails clean. I'll give him your love. Of course, I may not be able to see either of them on such a wet night. It's awfully difficult to be calm and collected. I know. I think I'll go home and wait for you there. I couldn't concentrate on the concert now. Don't tell Geoffrey. Let me see. Have I got the key, or does he? Mother, do you hate the idea of being a grandmother? No, I like it. Most women do. It's the men who object. I always remember your uncle Charles saying he didn't mind being a grandfather, but he didn't much like the idea of being married to a grandmother. I'm glad you don't mind. Nigel doesn't know yet. Doesn't know? Helen, do you mean that I-- or rather that you are-- oh my dear, what a time to tell me. You must see Nigel tonight. He's got a right to know. Surely Geoffrey could arrange it. No, you wouldn't. You don't know Geoffrey when he's working. See you soon. Good night, my dear. Goodnight. I'll leave some hot soup for you on the stove. Thank you. No waiting up, mind. No. [car starting] MARTHA: Geoffrey! RADCLIFFE: Huh? The key. Oh. You need someone to look after you. May I see your identity card, Please? We're going to the Benevolent. Thank you, sir. Back as soon as we can. I'm not going aboard, sentry. I just want a word with the quartermaster. Fine. Is the quartermaster there or the officer of the watch? I want to speak to the [inaudible].. If it's a confab you want, what's wrong with me? Nothing if that's what I wanted, but it isn't. Be a dear and fetch the duty officer. What's going on Taylor? Wren here wants a word with you, sir. Yes, what's wrong. I wondered, I very much want to speak to Lieutenant Commander Weiland. It's rather special. Good heavens. Helen. Who is it? It's me, you fathead. Benjie! Good gracious, if you've grown a beard, or is it the light? BENJIE: No, it's a beard. Your voice sounds different, muffled with the beard I suppose. All done by gin and Navy rum. How's mother? Very well. She sent you her love. I bet she said, tell him not to get his feet wet and to wash behind his ears or something. Tell her I like her a lot, will you? I will. I'll see what I can do about Nigel. You better not come on board. We're almost sailing. Take care of yourself. [sirens in distance] BETTY: Is that you, Martha? MARTHA: Yes. Betty? BETTY: It is? What's wrong? You look pretty comic. Well, you're nothing to boast about yourself. Least I haven't got two hats on. Before the night's out, you'll wish you had. Bottom end for me, top end for you. See you later. Hello, Nigel, my darling. Geoffrey slipped me a note before Benji saw me. Oh, bless you. Now that you're here, I can't think of any of the things I wanted to say to you. You're here and I'm here. That's all that matters. Only for a minute, I expect. Is the conference over? My party's. They won't be long over the rest. I wish I could see you better. Just as well you can't, pretty filthy. Nigel. What? [banging] Oh, nothing. I wrote you today about life insurance and things. There's still a little money in the Piccadilly Bank in case you need it, darling. I explain it in the letter. I'm just trying to leave things as tidy as possible for you. I know, my sweet. Though you needn't worry about me. Really, you needn't. I can't help it. I wish I didn't like you so much. I think I'm rather fond of you too. You look about six in that uniform. Wish I would like to behave like it. Do you know you've never saluted me yet. I mean to each time you meet. No respect for rank, no respect at all. That's what it is, of course. I wonder if all the great lovers through the ages have talked such drivel to each other at last moments. Perhaps they both hadn't jobs to think about at the same time. Nigel-- [explosions in the distance] Confound it, I'd forgotten the raid. Where's your tin hat? It's in the poop. Put it on. Darling, no, please. I look such a chump in it. Put it on. Aye, aye, sir. Can't I just hold it ready in my hand? [inaudible] that puts the tin lid on it. What were you going to tell me? Oh, it was nothing really. Somehow it would sound so ridiculous with this thing on. What vanity. Besides, it's very becoming. You really must love me after all. I believe I do. You won't forget the life insurance. I won't forget. [explosions intensify] Sentry. - This is my husband, sir. - I'm sorry, sir. I was just-- I've been on the gangway for the last 60 seconds and I am therefore entirely au fait with the situation. I'm very sorry, my dear. I must get back at once. Stand by for all of us, I'm afraid. Yes, sir. Right you are. Good luck And you. [explosions continue] [phone ringing] Hello? Hello. Hel-- [music playing] Well, well. [music playing] Everything's working to timetable. Excellent news so far. I wish I didn't feel so cut off. I know what you mean. Though mind you, for the first time in my life, I'm thankful that I'm a woman. Every time I look at that see, I keep thinking about the time that Gaye and me went for a trip around the bay at Margaret. Did I want to die. And now them poor lads. Thanks. I feel as though I'm cut in half, as though there's half of me here the other half's-- crossing that choppy sea, I suppose. That's why I'm not interested in eating. Well, where would you like me to start? Well, there aren't any dishes and no beds to make. Shall I start scrubbing through here? I know it's not the right day, but it's got to be done sometime. So I said to my daughter, I said if they call up the 50s to 60s next, I think I'll go I said. And if there's one thing my daughter hates, it's housework. So she said they have no right to call up the 50s, let alone the 60s. Housework is an important job she said. Oh, is it, I said. Pity the only time anyone ever thinks that's when they might have a bit of it to do themselves. And it's true. It's the only time the housewife gets any kudos. Except of course for the annual word given by the BBC as a sop to keep us at it. That's right. [door slams] Helen? Thank heavens one of you is back. Only for five minutes. I'm on my way to the base. I called in for clean collars for the three of us. Could you get me one of Geoffrey's? How's everything going? We've heard so little. Splendidly I believe. You've probably heard as much as we have. Anything else I can do? No thank you. Tell me, the other night did you see Nigel? Mm-hmm. Oh, I am glad. And Benjie, how was he looking? Benjie I mean. Frightful, got a beard. Oh, bless my soul. And Nigel? Oh, Helen, must you scrub 99 times just now? What did he say about the baby? I didn't tell him. I couldn't, mother. Partly because there were people about, but mainly-- well, it needed such a little thing to to finish us both. I know. Your father and I went through the same thing. I didn't think I could live through what you did in the last war, and yet, well, here I am doing it. One isn't given any choice, only a little extra strength from somewhere I think. I hope so. I like to think of Nigel being there to keep an eye on Benjie. Your father was in the same ship as my brother in the last war. Queer to think of it happening all over again. Your father got all our eggs in one basket, the old Benevolent. Well, as long as it's a safe one, that's all to the good. Thank you. You're sure there isn't anything else I can do? No, there really isn't. I wish I could be of some use. Dear me. What's that for? Just love. Oh, mother, I forgot. Benji said I to tell you he likes you rather a lot. Bye. Mrs. Dacre, Mrs. Dacre, quick! The fishmonger's got fish. - What? Fish at Wilson's. I saw it arriving, only be quick. Here. Newspaper. Oh yes. It's today's, but it can't be helped. Action at last. The Housewives' battlecry-- the fishmonger's got fish. I don't [inaudible] thing, and I don't think anybody else does. It all seems so unreal. We thought it would start with a flourish of trumpets or something, and it hasn't. You know, my heart stood still when I heard those planes go over. Now I'm beginning to feel slightly sick. And I keep telling myself, there will be no Dunkirk this time. One four-and-a-half? [inaudible] REPORTER [ON RADIO]: This is the BBC Home and Forces program. Here is the news read by Joseph MacLeod. D-day has come. Early this morning, the Allies began the assault on the Northwestern face of Hitler's European fortress. The prime minister has told The Commons that the commanding officers have reported everything going to plan so far. Here they come. Who? Hello, miss. Bad luck. What happened? Bumped into a mine. Trying to remember where we met. Is my sarong putting you off? Night before last, you wouldn't talk to me. You wanted a duty officer, remember? [inaudible] second door on the right. Go and get it, boys. So long. [phone ringing] It's the first batch of that little lot. Stand by your car, miss. [music playing] Feeling queer? - Yes. I-- Helen. [music intensifies] Geoffrey, at last. My dear, you must be exhausted. I felt I must come and tell you myself. The Benevolent? Some of the crew are safe they think. Oh God. They're bringing her home as soon as she's well enough. I better go down again and try to get some more definite news. Wait a minute. Wait until Helen comes if you can. Talk to me. I mustn't break down. This is the time when I must try to be of some use. Well, this language of ours is so completely inadequate, I-- well, I just don't know what to say to you. I know. Let's-- let's talk about the weather, anything. Oh, Geoffrey, they're so young, they haven't lived. They've left no mark on the world, a boy like Benjie. No, dear, wait. He may be safe. We don't know. You're wrong about them leaving no mark on the world. They made it earlier and more decisively that's all. I'm not one of those who believe that there's no reason behind all this. There must be. All the unselfish courage that's been loosed on the world, that must have some good effect, surely. It was the same in the last war, and the effect wasn't so very good in the end. I'm not so sure. We've progressed a certain distance, not far enough I dare say, but we will. I hope you're right. Mother, Benjie's safe. He's at Renly about 12 miles up the coast with a nasty cut on his head and a broken leg, but he's all right. They're putting him into a hospital there. That's splendid. I suppose there isn't any-- Not yet. Benjie and about six others were picked up by minesweeper, rather ironical. We may not hear about the others for some time. Darling, come and sit down. No. I'll go and change first. Did Geoffrey tell you I fainted? Wasn't it idiotic. He rather overdid the reviving and now I'm soaking. I'll get into a dressing gown I think. I'll make you some tea. No, I'll do that. That's great news about Benjie. Queer how delighted you can be to hear that your son's got a nasty cut on his head and a broken leg. No, I'm not crying, just shaking. Nerves, I suppose. If I'd let Helen come back first, it would have saved you minutes of anxiety. I meant well. Then I wouldn't have had the comfort of your shoulder now. Is it a comfort? Beyond all belief. I must get back. Yes, of course. Thank you, Geoffrey. I'm all right now. Darling, you're wearing yourself out. Don't you think-- I'm all right. I feel quite calm, but sort of numb. I know how you feel. [phone ringing] Hello. Yes. Mrs. Maling-- - Kill her, mother! Kill her! No, I'll come in later. I'm sorry. I can't talk now. How dare she. She might have known. Helen, darling, steady. She doesn't know we're waiting for a call. If she did, of course she wouldn't have rung up. I know. I'm sorry. Oh, it's so awful. Apparently I'm neither calm nor numb. I am sorry, mother. Good gracious, my blessing. There's nothing to be sorry about. Dear, who would be a mother? [inaudible] indeed. I've nursed you through whooping cough when you were a baby, diphtheria, double pneumonia when you very nearly died. And here you are up against something far bigger, and all I can do is to stand by and watch and be useless. That isn't true. You're the greatest help anybody could be. That isn't saying much. Does this drive you mad mother? It's easier than sitting still. I only hope you wear some of the ghastly pattern off this carpet. I was such a fool to faint. I might have been down on the key finding out for myself, meeting them, not just waiting. Darling, what are you doing now? This has gone far enough. We're going to play demon patience. Now, you sit there. Mother dearest, I couldn't. Yes, you could. If Nigel arrives here, he must find something better than just a bundle of nerves. Now, we'll both lose our tempers. We always do. But it's better than sitting around doing nothing. Now we'll shuffle for each other. Do you still click your cards over? It's the right way. It's a maddening noise. Changes the cards each time. Your way doesn't. Don't just quarrel before we begin. We each play our own way. There you are. This is ridiculous. Now, you say go. One, two, three, go. Nothing but picture cards. Blind as a bat? Where? Oh. I believe you're cheating. Never mind, I'm doing well. I'm nearly out. [phone ringing] Hello? Hello? No, you rang me. But there must be. Hello? Yes, speaking. Yes, sir. They have? You're sure it was him? He was identified? How badly? I see. When will they operate? I can't see him? No, I understand. I shall hear from you. Thank you, sir. Yes. Thank you for phoning. He's safe. He's safe, but he's badly hurt. His head and his arm. They'll operate at once on it. Mother, he must live. He must. Darling Nigel. [music playing] [gunfire and explosions] Rest? If it's a boy, I'd like to call him Rupert. Why Rupert? I'd rather call him after you. I was thinking of Rupert Evans. Sorry, Nigel, I didn't realize. I'd like to call him Rupert. It's difficult to understand somehow. If there's a plan to all this, why should a chap like Rupert be killed? He had a brilliant brain and wonderful future in front of him. Others like me come through. I don't know. Perhaps I can't question that fairly when I got you back. Darling Helen. It's going to be difficult to settle down in an office again back in Birmingham, back to where I left off. I'd like to do something more constructive, something more urgent. But it is being constructive to go back to the job one knows, even if it is ordinary or dreary at times. Oh dear. I can't explain what I mean, but-- [plane flying overhead] Keep going, you basket. Keep going. [explosion] [music playing] REPORTER [ON RADIO]: Hello, forces. This is Sandy at the theater organ with another program of messages and musical greetings to you chaps serving abroad. Now, first on the list today is Sergeant Roddy McIntyre who is serving with the Royal Artillery somewhere on the continent. Hello, Roddy. I've got a greeting for you from a girl who's serving in the wrens, Wren Dacre, Lolly to you. Lolly sends her love, Roddy. And here's the tune she's asked me to play for you. We'll Meet Again. [music playing] Latest! Latest! Front wall stand by for cease fire. Latest! Latest! [music intensifies] You know, there's something rather wonderful about families. Hear, hear. Hurry up and get married, Lolly. I promise you, five minutes after Roddy gets back. [laughter] I want to have hundreds of grandchildren, to be the center of a pool with the ripples spreading out. Quick, give her another drink and get up off the stage. We've kept it for five years. That's long enough. Hush. [baby crying] The lady's ripple is making itself heard. Oh dear. - Bring him down. - All right. Yes, do fetch him. Yes, yes, bring him down just for a moment. Mustn't make him too excited. He just wants us to remember he's there. And quite right too. Now he'll be able to say for the rest of his life that he celebrated VE night at his first party. Yes, he will. [laughter] Only for a minute or two remember. Aww. I say, it's beginning to look almost human. RADCLIFFE: What do you expect? This is a very special occasion, my blessing. You were done out of a party at your christening, but one of your godfathers is here tonight. You ought to wish something for him, Geoffrey. What? Beauty, ability, brains. Yes, go on. Yes, that's a very good idea. What do you wish him, Geoffrey? Well, that's rather a solemn thought to spring on a chap so suddenly, isn't it? He's trying to get out of it. [laughter] No, no, no, no, I'm not. Come on. Well, I hope, old man, you'll grow up into a world where loving one's neighbor as oneself is something more than just a vague ideal. If that wish comes true, I don't think I can add much else. Thank you, Geoffrey. From Roddy, by proxy. To Rupert Weiland. A happy life to you, young fellow with plenty of striving and some achievement as the recipe. From your godfather and prospective uncle, Roddy. [laughter] Well, you couldn't expect much else. You've got charming godfathers, my precious. [laughter] Time you went to bed, my darling. Come along. Good night, Rupert. Sleep well. Good night, old man. Bye, Rupert. [interposing voices] It's been a wonderful day and I'm a very happy woman. - Speech. - Yes. Come on, mother, speech. I couldn't. I'm far too hiccupy. [hiccups] Gracious, I really am. Come on, mother. We'll overlook the hiccs. I can only say how happy I am to see you all here over and over again. Well said. But I tell you what I will do. As the lone civilian here, I'll drink to you all and I'll stand up to do it. No, it's all right, Nigel. I can stand. To you and all those like you who served for me and all those like me who couldn't, our thanks. To those who also served, though they didn't have much time to stand and wait [inaudible].. Up, all of you. To your mother and all mothers. Mother. Mother. And all mothers. Thank you. Oh dear, I'm getting maudlin. We'd better start the washing up. Not on your life. Mrs. Gaye left strict instructions that tonight we were to stack. [laughter] [music playing] [cheering] I've got the chance of a job when I'm demobbed of course-- aircraft radio installations. It should be interesting, but the pay won't be much at first. Never mind. You take it, Roddy. With any luck, it should lead to something really worthwhile. It's what I've always wanted to do. I've got ideas I'd like to put into practice. Extraordinary business science. Look at the trailing feathers of his wing when he opens them out to get more wing area, just the same as the flaps on an airplane. But the thing is, of course-- The thing is, my darling, for you to get demobbed as fast as you can. Yes. Can't be fast enough for me. REPORTER [ON RADIO]: This is the BBC Home Recorded Programs. Come on. I'll race you down to the sea. Hey, that's cheating. REPORTER [ON RADIO]: Read By Joseph MacLeod. Scientists, British and American, have made the atomic bomb at last. The first one was dropped on a Japanese city this morning. The target for the first atomic bomb was the city of Hiroshima. After the bomb landed, airmen reported that Hiroshima was completely hidden by an impenetrable cloud of smoke and dust. [music playing] You're better at this than handling that [inaudible].. But you're such a wonderful partner, Mrs. G. Oh, don't mention it, Commander R. [music - "hokey pokey"] ALL: [SINGING] And that's what it's all about! [clapping] I can hardly believe yet that there'll be no more bombing, no more fire watching. They've become part of our lives. Benjie's sailing in 10 days. That pipe will become quite unsmokable. Martha, will you marry me? Yes, Geoffrey. You see, I'm not unique after all. Oh, yes you are, but in a different way. Oh, Martha, I was as nervous as a schoolboy. You really do love me? I really do. I can't think why. For a whole host of reasons. Your shoulder's the right height, and then think of Mrs. Gaye. Any man who can do what you did must be phenomenal. Don't laugh at me, Martha. I shall always laugh at you, my darling, but in the nicest possible way. We must go back. Helen can't go out until I'm there to look after the baby. Oh, hang Helen's baby. It's a very good baby. We'll hardly know it's there. [baby crying] No, no, no. Look, can't you stop it, or has it to run down? Shh. Is that better? Yes, much. Now, where was I? Your house. Thank goodness it wasn't blitzed. Well, it's only a small house with four rooms, a kitchen, and just a little garden, you know? That's perfect. Just right for the two of us. Oh, Geoffrey, I can't tell you how I'm looking forward to settling down in our own house, and in blessed peace. The children will be gone. I was dreading the idea of that once, but now I'm suddenly sick of being everybody's unpaid messenger boy, housekeeper, nanny, all rolled into one. I'm going to be a wife. [bell ringing] 1946. Happy new year, darling. And to you, my love. Here's peace and prosperity. Pray heavens, no more queues. [music playing] Pretend I don't know and you tell me. It's fish. Mm-hmm. There you are. What is it? Milk. Goat's milk. Wherever did you get it? From the usual place with the utmost difficulty. Look. Darling, do you mean it's-- but the cure may be worse than the complaint. I don't know anything about goats. Never mind. I'm learning. It's queer a bit. It's not bad. I think I rather like it. Anyway, it's milk and we'll be able to have your favorite pudding. Well, I better get a bath. Goats have a-- distinctive smell. [sighs] HARRIET: Martha! In here. Hello. Oh, whenever I come here I envy, you working in this delightful little kitchen I mean. Just at this minute, I'd willingly swap with your service flat. Whatever's the matter with that? It hasn't been cooked long enough. Exactly. And why hasn't it been cooked long enough? Because the electricity has been cut off. Oh, honestly, dear, have a bit of common sense. Why try and bake at the time that they cut the current off if it is going to be cut? Why indeed. Bad luck, old girl. Still, from my point of view, I seem to have come at the right time. That is precisely the sort of thing that we of the Militant Housewives League are fighting to prevent here. Pamphlet. Read this. [martha laughs] It's no laughing matter. It's serious and we want your support. Oh, Harriet, dear, it's all so silly. Nobody's rationing us on purpose. We are not so sure about that. But whatever the reason, the housewife's lot is unbearable, and unless we unite-- Please stop calling me a housewife. It's an ugly word to say, it looks horrible written down, and it's fundamentally untrue. At least if other women are wedded to their work, I'm not. Now you're quibbling. You won't come in with us, but you'll be glad enough to accept the advantages which you haven't the guts to fight for. Black leg, that's what you are. [laughter] Look at your sister. Oh, good gracious. [laughter] Boy, Harriet. You mean poor militant housewives. This is from Lolly, darling. Roddy is very pleased with his job. He has high hopes of promotion, which would mean working on the new jet-propelled Mascot 3 and going with her on her test flight to Australia. Well done, Roddy. If so, I should be a grass widow for about three weeks. Could I come and stay with you while he's away? Well, write and tell her we'd love to have her. I mustn't miss the 8:30. You must run, darling. Goodbye. Bye, bye. [music playing] You look like an advertisement for good health. A good investment. I don't feel in the least conspicuous now, or if I do, I don't care. One of these days we'll have that car we used to talk about. And the house. The house first I hope. As long as I've got you and Rupert and a roof over our heads-- And wheels under our feet. Yes. I'm satisfied. There's more chance than ever that they'll transfer me to the London branch now. Oh, darling, I do hope so. It'll be nice to be near mother and Geoffrey. We mustn't forget to send a wire to Roddy to wish him luck tomorrow. No. I bet he's excited. Oh, look. Hey! I thought that might happen. Bad lad. Come along. There. Never mind. I've got some more clothes in the basket. Good. Tea, darling? I'm dying for it. This is thirsty work. Good for the figure, dear. Mine will need a bigger garden than this. Anyway, we'll have our own vegetables this year. Oh, thanks. This is a really royal Easter. The King and Princess go racing. Oh, listen to this. Thousands left behind in biggest holiday rush since 1939. I expect there were crowds to see Roddy's plane take off. Lolly should be here at any moment. I'm glad we are spending our holidays at home. I wonder how Nigel and Helen managed. Don't know that it was wise of them to take Rupert in a sidecar in all that traffic. Darling. I'll go down there, Martha, straight away. - I'll come with you. - No. No, darling, because Lolly may be on her way here. Yes, of course. How is she? All she said was he wouldn't marry her during the war. Oh, Geoffrey. [music playing] This is the one I'm interested in. Yes, madam. Do you mind very much if I leave a bit earlier tonight? I've never asked you before, but tonight's a special occasion in our family. You see, my brother, he's coming home on leave from the Navy and we haven't seen him for two years. Oh, well, I expect that to be all right. Oh, thank you so much. Hello? Oh, yes, madam, speaking. I don't ever remember seeing Lolly McIntyre looking so happy. [music playing] He isn't here? No, you're the first. Lolly isn't back yet. Oh, darling, you have been hurrying. Well, I didn't want Benjie to arrive before me. I'll see to the drinks. Yes, I must go back to the dinner. Do you know they've put up your Danish blue cheese from two points to six? He is proper excited. I hope he arrives before my bus goes. I think everything's ready. We don't want it spoiling. Mrs. Radcliffe says these might help. Oh, good. Thank you, Mrs. G. I'm sort of excited myself at the thought of seeing the young lieutenant again. He reminds me of when my sister's son came home for her funeral. We were that excited at the thought of seeing him. You can't beat a family reunion now and then. How right you are, Mrs. G. Well, tonight you'll be like old times. Hey, only seems like yesterday when I first met you. Do you remember? With your uniform and all that gold braid and them medals? Well, it doesn't seem like yesterday to me. To be exact, it's just four years ago. My words. Four years. Fancy that. Hello, ugly. How are you? Hello! You're bigger and stronger than ever. Oh, darling. How lovely to see you again. Oh, my hair! Wait a minute. Let me have a look at you. Certainly not. Out of my way. I bought you a present. - Darling, what? Aha! Oh, rice. Lolly, look. Geoffrey, where are you? Look, Mrs. Gaye, real rice. How are you, Mrs. G? Oh, nicely. Thanks, Lieutenant D. [inaudible] just let [inaudible] and have a look. This [inaudible] entirely in your honor. I was searching for my one unfrayed collar. How are you? Indecently healthy. Thank you, sir. Look, Geoffrey. We'll be able to have a rice pudding at last. I can scarcely believe it. You're very welcome. Mother, if you go on staring at me, I shall make some disgusting noises with my soup. What's the matter about, dribbling or something? No, of course not. Was I staring? I'm sorry. Somehow it's difficult to believe that you're no longer my rather grubby little boy. Oh, is that all? Don't be too optimistic, though. I'm all spruced up for the occasion. I should jolly well think so. You don't expect the Navy to let the tone of the party down. [laughter] It's extraordinary how pleasant it is to be home. It's hardly polite, is it? Hello, who's here? Well, it's Helen and Nigel. Hooray! MARTHA: Oh, how lovely. Hello, Geoffrey. Hello. Into the gatecrashers. Darling, where on earth [inaudible] Home. Hello, Lolly. What do you think's happened? I've been transferred. To London. Hello, Benji. How nice to see you. I see how he's grown. I hope it's all right, mother. We brought our rations. We meant to let you know and come tomorrow, but I suddenly remembered Benjie returns tonight. So we threw our things into a bag, flew for the train-- And caught it by the skin of our teeth. I'm very glad you're here. - I start my new job on Monday. - Well done. Got to find a flat or something before then. Well, it's quite all right, or will be in a minute. This makes it quite perfect. I'm delighted to see you both. I'm dying to hear about your transfer, but just let me know about that later. Right. Mother, darling, may I go and take off my mat? MARTHA: Yes, darling, of course. I expect the young fella's a bit tired. He had a very [inaudible] [inaudible] in the other room, all right? How old did you say? We just have to cut the slices a bit smaller. That's right. I know I'll miss that bus. And arrange the onions in six little groups, and then you must go. I'll manage the rest. What about using some of them short breads? [inaudible] filling to make it look more substantial. That's a very good idea. What would I do without you, Mrs. Gaye? Well, there they are. Can you manage now, love? - Yes, that's all right. You get [inaudible]. I'm off. Ta-ta. Good night, and thank you so much, Mrs. Gaye. Everything under control? Yes, although my arithmetic isn't good enough to work it out. Where can they sleep? Well, We've two camp beds and-- well, we'll work it out later. Helen's putting the baby in the sitting room on the [inaudible]. Martha, Martha. There isn't enough gin to go around. Oh dear. Well, look, here's half a lemon. Put a little in each glass and fill the rest up with soda water. This is going to be a very family cocktail. That was the reason [inaudible] Brown went into retirement. [laughter] Mother, that was a lovely trifle. There seems to be some left. Any offers? Not me, thank you. Speak now. Exactly [inaudible]. I'll do my best. Oh, Benjie. There you are. Good show. Well, so much for starving Britain. I ask you, trifle with cream? Oh, we have our moments, although it may only be mock cream. And English sponge cake. In three minutes you must be off. I think you'd better have your coffee in the theater, darling. Nigel, your shirt's gone again. What, here? More [inaudible]. I'm a bit frayed about the cuffs myself. We're all a bit shoddy these days. No. Shabby perhaps, but not yet shoddy I hope. You never will become shoddy. It's all right, darling, we won't. It's time you're off. Otherwise you'll miss the first act. Come on. I think you and mother should go after all your planning. No, no, no. We want to stay behind with the baby. We haven't seen him for ages. [interposing voices] See you now. Enjoy yourselves. MARTHA: They'll never find a flat in four days. They'll be lucky if they find one in four months. We'll have to manage somehow. We've planned it all just for the two of us. You know how it is. Things don't look so good, do they? No, they don't. It's a muddled world these days, but at least this time we're not shutting our eyes to things. We are facing them. And on the whole with all our faults, we haven't done so badly. We still believe in freedom of action. Freedom of thought. Quite remarkable, freedom of speech. That's your heritage, young man. Please God, it always will be. You're very nice, darling. I married into a very nice family. It's a good thing you think so. You know, I was just thinking. Apart from Roddy, here we are with a house full of family again, back where we started. Not quite. No, not quite. [music playing] That's life, that is. [roaring]
