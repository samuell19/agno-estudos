(dramatic music) - And the winner is Deutschland. - [Narrator] After six years of anticipation and expectation, Germany's moment finally arrived. The 2006 FIFA World Cup would be football's biggest ever party. Hundreds of thousands of fans from 32 nations enjoyed the unique atmosphere in 12 host cities. Some of Europe's most advanced stadia provided a fitting stage for the most famous names in the game as well as World Cup newcomers like Trinidad and Tobago and Angola. Every team shared one objective, to reach the final in Berlin's Olympic Stadium. The legendary Pele got the greatest event in the game under way. Group A saw the host Germany drawn with neighbors Poland, Ecuador and their opponents for the tournament opener, Costa Rica. - [Commentator] Now the ball is nudged forward here by Borowski. Should be picked up down that left side by Lahm. Chance is here and the Costa Rican goalkeeper is beaten. And Germany, extraordinary score through Philipp Lahm with only five minutes played. What a start to the 2006 FIFA World Cup. Germany one, Costa Rica nil. You'd have had long, long odds on Philipp Lahm. Only second international goal and this is where Lahm picked the ball up, two red shirts ahead of him. There was a slip, it's opened the door for Lahm. He blasted through it. One nil Germany. The World Cup is alive and well and kicking again. This is Costa Rica's opportunity. They look for an offside. There isn't one. Wanchope will equalize. What drama here. Drama in Munich as Paulo Wanchope strikes his 44th goal for his country. Was there an offside in here? Or were they just caught out? There's the pass. Well, the player on this side of the field may just be playing him on. Wanchope, on he goes. One touch is two, the third one dispatches it beyond Jens Lehmann into Germany's net and Costa Rica most dramatically have leveled here. Frings very busy, part of the German midfield. There he is once again. Schneider pressurized by Marin. Does well to create space for the cross. It's a pull back here. There may be something this time for Germany. There certainly is. That's a second goal. And the birthday boy, Miroslav Klose has restored Germany's lead. Schneider did ever so well but this was the killer ball played in and played across by Schweinsteiger. The goal scorer was Klose. Lahm. The crowd just trying to lift the Germans. It's been a bit of a soporific period unlike the start to the first half. Gap here. Lahm, can he cross a telling ball in? He might do. Saved first time, not the second. Klose's got his second. Germany have their third. They're probably on their way to three World Cup points. Suddenly there was space for Lahm here. It didn't look to be the perfect cross but it went over the top of Marin and given a second opportunity, Klose wasn't about to turn it down. Drummond. Does well, gets it into Centeno. Wanchope tries to make himself available down Centeno's right. This is Centeno now. And in for Wanchope and Wanchope's got his second for Costa Rica. Game on again. Lovely ball from Centeno, straight between the two central defenders. Schweinsteiger who rolls it for Frings. He'll smack it in. My goodness me, will he smack it in? Torsten Frings has brought Munich to its feet in its entirety. It flew beyond Porras' straining left arm and into the roof of the net. Doesn't matter how many times you see this one, it looks pretty good. Perfectly placed. - [Commentator] Zewlakow to safety. This is a good spell for Ecuador. It's de la Cruz. Flicked on dangerously. It's a very good spell for Ecuador. Carlos Tenorio with that deft header gives Ecuador the lead. Edison Mendez again. Valencia. So many of these Ecuador players could be putting themselves in the shot window for top European clubs for next season. And here's Kaviedes, onside, two nil. Delgado surely wins the game for Ecuador. Poland were looking for offside, I think he was level. Kaviedes just squared the ball to Agustin Delgado. - [Commentator] Frings. Juergen Klinsmann right on the edge of his technical area urging his side forward. Schneider into Odonkor. Odonkor's cross, it's there. It's the winner. Joy unconfined in Dortmund. The deadlock is broken at last. And all around the stadium the flags are being hoisted now. - [Commentator] There's a mistake. It's been seized upon here by Ecuador. Delgado. Nicely worked out. And Ecuador score. Carlos Tenorio with a goal. His second in the tournament. And Ecuador's second participation in the World Cup finals is getting better and better and better. Been strict edict sent down to the referees from FIFA that any time wasting will cause a problem. Here's Delgado. Right through the goalkeeper Porras. And Agustin Delgado has surely now booked Ecuador's passage into the last 16. Mendez helped it on and Delgado helped himself. It's brilliant from Delgado. But they'll keep their eye firmly on the ball will Ecuador. They won't count their blessings too much but they will count a third goal. Magnificent, Kaviedes with a volley. Genuine talent out there. Edison Mendez right on the money. - [Commentator] Headed by Mertesacker but. Here's Lahm. Schneider. It's a good ball in, they're stretching them here. First goal of the game. Less than four minutes played. Miroslav Klose cartwheels away. Simply pulled in too far across and when it was wheeled back in for Miroslav Klose, he wasn't gonna miss from there. He makes a habit of scoring in World Cup finals. It's his third of this tournament. Schweinsteiger. Ballack. Little chip forward, Klose to chase, Klose's around the goalkeeper. How did he get through? He doesn't care, it's a second goal. Miroslav Klose, his second of the game, his second grace of the tournament. You add that to the hat trick he scored in 2002 against the Saudis and you know that once this man has the appetite for goal, he rarely gives up scoring. Thumping effort from Tenorio which is locked away. Germany on the counterattack. Schneider's across. Finally. He has his goal. Nevermind a celebration, feel the relief. That will be one of the most popular German goals hopefully that you will see. Lukas Podolski under pressure to find his form, slides in the third for Germany. There's no way back now for Ecuador. - [Commentator] This has been very deliberate from Gomez. But will it be he? It is. And it's a goal for Costa Rica. Well he was so measured about that free kick situation. Good movement from the Costa Rican players. That opened up the space. Look how Marin broke off that wall. Zurawski. Porras has slipped and the goal has been scored by Poland. They were all looking around to see if there might have been an incident in there but Bosacki, the center back, suddenly arrived. It was a slip by the goalkeeper Porras. He just lost his own footing. Well maybe just a little bit of contact there from Smolarek. Unbalanced Porras. And the header is in. Second goal for Bosacki. Krzynowek's flighted corner and a convincing header getting above Paulo Wanchope to bury his header. - [Narrator] The top two were safely through to the last 16 by the time they met in the final round of games. Germany's emphatic victory over Ecuador ensured they won the group. Group B included debutantes Trinidad and Tobago along with experienced campaigners England, Sweden, and Paraguay. - [Commentator] England won six nil a week ago against Jamaica. Beckham created a couple of goals. And here they've scored again. England have the lead. Michael Owen may have got the final touch but again it's a Beckham delivery that opens the way for England to score. And this may well be a Beckham goal on his, oh no, it's off a Paraguayan head, I think, there. - [Commentator] Lennon. Header to pick out Beckham, in towards Crouch. Peter Crouch breaks the deadlock. His first goal at the World Cup finals. Beckham's cross plum onto the head of Peter Crouch. And for once he'd eluded Lawrence, it was Crouch against Sancho and he towered above him. We're in stoppage time. Gerrard. Gerrard. Oh, yes. Steven Gerrard has beaten Shaka Hislop again. Just has he did in the English FA Cup final. A terrific Steven Gerrard goal. - [Commentator] Elmander. Allback. Here's the chance and here's the goal. Finally, finally, Ljungberg scores. And Sweden's World Cup hopes are suddenly lifted. And with less than two minutes of the 90 remaining, Sweden get their first goal of these finals. - [Commentator] Beckham in towards Crouch. Back across the face of goal. Looking for Lampard. Breaks here for Joe Cole. Oh brilliant, just brilliant. He's having an inspired game. Joe Cole has arrived on the international stage at the World Cup finals with a quite wonderful goal. Sweden need a goal. They have been goal shy at these championships. Just one so far but there's number two. They're level. Allback on target, it's one one. Nobody picked up Allback here. Nobody could keep out his goal bound header. Gerrard was almost there. Joe Cole flicks it in. Gerrard. Scores again for England. His second successive game. Fantastic cross by Joe Cole and there was Steven Gerrard to claim his second World Cup goal in Germany. Edman takes the throw. Oh they've all missed it. It's gone in, it's two two. Who got the final touch? It matters little. Yet it was Larsson with the merest of flicks. - [Commentator] The goal Paraguay conceded against England was from this sort of area. They may concede again. Paraguay have got their first goal of the World Cup finals and it may well be an own goal. I think the ball may have floated off Brent Sancho. I think we'll see from this delivery that the final touch is there from Sancho. Little one two in the area, beautifully done. Paraguay have their second goal. It was a lovely goal, too, from Nelson Cuevas. Watch how Cuevas tees it all up. There's the run, there's the pass, and here is the finish. - [Narrator] Goals were scarce in Group B. Trinidad and Tobago departed rightly proud of their performances and Paraguay were far from disgraced. But as expected England and Sweden could not be caught. (dramatic music) A formidable lineup in Group C. Argentina, the Netherlands, impressive qualifiers Serbia and Montenegro, and the promising Africans of Cote d'Ivoire. - [Commentator] Riquelme has it placed. Just beyond the midway point of the first half. Again there are five in the middle. Heinze's up there, Ayala's up there as well. It was Heinze who almost got a touch. And then it's turned home by Crespo. First goal of the game and Hernan Crespo gives Argentina the lead. Riquelme's cross. Just took a deflection and Crespo was there. Just trying to stretch them a little here. Riquelme, well timed ball, Saviola. Stunning goal. It was clinical, absolutely clinical. It was Crespo who just stepped offside. Saviola came from an onside position. And for that reason the goal is allowed to stand. Kalou to, terrific ball through. Bakari Kone pulls it back over the head of Drogba. Still there's danger here though. Drogba has the goal back. It's game on. Nine minutes left to play. And Cote d'Ivoire are back in the match. Who else, Didier Drogba. - [Commentator] Helped on its way to Robben who's got the pace here. Only the keeper to beat and Arjen Robben opens the Dutch. Once the ball had been played through here, there weren't too many doubts in the mind of Robben who's just onside. Had the pace and had the finish. - [Commentator] Mascherano, Sorin. Look at the ease at which Argentina are playing these short passes. Crespo waiting in the middle here, that's a fantastic ball. Opening goal for Argentina. Maxi Rodriguez, it's taken them barely five minutes. Fantastic crafted goal. Saviola set him up. Maxi Rodriguez, a real toe poke of a goal. Cambiasso. Mascherano. Maxi Rodriguez forcing it wide, here's Sorin. Cambiasso. This is where Argentina can be very patient indeed. I've watched their youth teams do this. Just play the ball endlessly around the edge of their opponent's penalty area then suddenly break with devastating consequences. Saviola, Cambiasso. Cambiasso, they've done it, they've done it and scored a fantastic goal. How many passes did they put together there? You'd need a calculator. The interpassing here was just devastating. Have you ever seen a better crafted goal at the World Cup finals? Milito. Saviola's won it. Is this number three? It is you know. Maxi Rodriguez claims his second goal of the game and it all started with that piece of opportunism there by Saviola. Via an upright. You'd could almost believe he meant that. Here's Messi. Brilliant goal, Crespo. Messi's touch was pure magic. You can see now why they rate him. It was like threading the ball through the eye of a needle. Look at this. Tevez. I don't believe it, I just don't believe it. Untouchable. Another fantastic World Cup goal. We're not talking about Argentina playing one of the minnows of the world game, we're talking about Serbia and Montenegro, the former Yugoslavia with really good players. Tevez. Is this another goal? Of course it is. It's Messi. He just had to score. The hero of Argentina. The player they've clamored for to be included has scored a sixth. - [Commentator] Van Persie and Robben and Sneijder. Could all be involved here. Or any one of them. Looks like van Persie. You don't score better goals in a World Cup than that. And Robin van Persie scores his first ever World Cup finals goal. What a cracker. Magnificently struck. Two, three goalkeepers wouldn't have kept that one out. And the occasion is illuminated by the Netherlands' Robin van Persie, the 22 year old, with only his second ever goal for his country. And here goes Arjen Robben now and he'll just simply come in field and they'll have to chase him. It's Robben, he's come a long way. Van Bommel. The Dutch have plenty forward here. There's danger, chance of a second. Two it is. Ruud van Nistelrooij has steered Holland two goals clear. And it might be a Netherlands nightmare for Cote d'Ivoire. It's all glory for those in orange. But was he in an offside position when he received? He was just coming back and he's just got level there. He's okay. And van Nistelrooij, you just knew he was never gonna miss. Netherlands two, Cote d'Ivoire nil. With Rudd van Nistelrooij showing he's as good as ever. Kone, great pace into the area he goes, can he finish? Can he finish? What a goal. Bakary Kone brings Cote d'Ivoire right back into this invigorating contest in Stuttgart. - [Commentator] Zigic transfers it sharply, then it's played further wide by Ilic. And it is up towards Zigic, the only one in here. He's going to score, it's a first goal in the World Cup finals for Serbia and Montenegro. And it's gone to the giant, to Nikola Zigic. And poor Boubacar Barry Copa, the goalkeeper is left totally stranded. Great ball in, over the top of the defender and Zigic taking it down, tucks it away. It's as simple as you like. Zigic is in there. Might be two here. Two it is and Sasa Ilic has made it two for Serbia and Montenegro and the Ivorian defense is all at sea. The Cote d'Ivoire defense is all over the place. Arthur Boka again to drive one in. Taken away and it's a hand ball is it? The referee says so. And it's gonna be at least a yellow card. Boka's ball, I wonder if he slipped here. What are you thinking about? And a huge thunderclap goes across the stadium as Dindane slides it into the net. No, the referee says no. He wants it taken again because there was encroachment. I always think that's horrible for the penalty taker especially when he's scored. Now he's got to decide whether to put the ball in the same place or somewhere else in the net if he can. Jevric is poised to try and stop it. The referee's trying to make sure that nobody treads inside that area. Dindane puts it in the same place and this time the referee says good enough. Again. They've got it, they've got their second goal. And how much they deserve it and Aruna Dindane has a double. And how the Ivorians celebrate. It's the first time they've got a double and that's the way to do it. Didier's joining in as well. And Aruna Dindane's glancing little header is too good for Jevric. The shot is through, deflected and he's gonna give another penalty. It's the second they've had, they might have had three but Senor Rodriguez points to the spot for the second time. Well, Dindane's on a hat trick. Bonaventure Kalou's asking for the ball though. Dindane's saying please can I have it. And this is another hand ball by the same man who handled in the first half, Dudic. Boubacar Barry Copa can't bear to watch. He's left kissing one of the goalposts. And Bonaventure Kalou can strike Cote d'Ivoire into a lead. Can he? Is this his moment to fame? Bonaventure for him and Bonaventure it is. Cote d'Ivoire three, Serbia and Montenegro two. Sensational stuff in Munich. - [Narrator] Cote d'Ivoire did at least have a win to remember but Serbia and Montenegro were disappointing. Their thrashing by Argentina placed the South Americans ahead of the Dutch on goal difference. (dramatic music) Group D appeared straightforward with Portugal and Mexico clear favorites against debutantes Angola and outsiders Iran. - [Commentator] Mexico themselves have won only 10 of their World Cup matches. Another 41 in the finals. Looking to improve on that record. And maybe here. Mexico score. Omar Bravo, the controversial selection from, perfectly positioned. Mexico one, Iran nil. Bravo by name and Bravo by nature. Pardo. There's the header which really opened up Iran. From the right boot of Ali Karimi. And there's plenty of height on this one and there is trouble here. Iran will score dramatically. And it's the big, big defender Yahya Golmohammadi with the leveler. Mahdavikia. That was a shocking giveaway there. Oh and that might be another one here. Have they let him in? Chance here for Bravo. He's got both goals today. He takes the salute. He's hobbling away but I bet he doesn't feel any pain. Calamitous defending from Iran. Got two and they're looking for more to really underline their supremacy. The cross in is good. Three it is. It's Mexico's day and Zinha. Mexico three, Iran one. - [Commentator] Luis Figo. Round, Luis Figo, Pauleta. Set up by Luis Figo. And Portugal's all time record goal scorer adds to his score. - [Commentator] Figo, he's got support from Nuno Valente. May not need him, it's Luis Figo. It's Deco. Oh, magnificent. Special goal from a special player. Game getting stretched now as Figo goes down. Referee says penalty. And I don't think there can be any doubt can there? 21 year old Cristiano Ronaldo. Waits for referee whistle. Composes himself. And scores. And the boy from Madeira who loves playing for his country as much as anyone scores a penalty. - [Commentator] Rafael Marquez. Caneira catch it out. Good touch by Simao. Simao goes the return, Helder Postiga on mark down the middle. Simao delayed, he's pulled it back brilliantly here. One nil to Portugal. Maniche on target after five minutes. Simao took the ball on and on and on. Who was marking Maniche? Nobody. Are they dancing? Luis Figo. I think that's a penalty. The referee spotted some pushing and shoving going on. And he is impervious to any Mexican complaints. Hand ball. We're midway through the half. Portugal with a penalty and a chance to make it two nil. Simao makes it two nil. Maybe Portugal have just taken their eye off the game slightly with this two nil advantage. Fonseca in the middle there. Pardo takes it, flicks on, and flicks in. Fonseca. It's Mexican's boy. Lovely flick there by Fonseca. - [Commentator] And Loco for Angola. Now Figueiredo. Ze Kalanga with his pace once more. Flavio's in the middle. It's Flavio it's aimed for, and it's Flavio who scores. It's there first ever World Cup finals goal. And who knows, who knows, is this the cue for a quite sensational story to unravel here in Leipzig? Mahdavikia standing over it poised. Cool in the shadows. Oh and it's a heartbreaker. Bakhtiarizadeh has turned it in. And maybe with a goal, Angola's chances of progressing have disappeared. - [Narrator] Angola's good showing almost upset the odds but Mexico did manage the runner's up spot. While Portugal's 100% record sent a clear message to the rest of the world. Group E was arguably the closest to call. Italy were marginal favorites but the Czech Republic, Ghana, and the United States looked hard to separate. - [Commentator] Totti lays it short where Pirlo has taken up position unnoticed and can drive it in for a sensational goal. Six minutes before half time, Italy have the breakthrough. And it was a quality strike from Andrea Pirlo. From that range and with so little to aim for, that was a terrific goal. Not everybody thinks so, though. It's a good start so far by the Italians but Ghanaians still have plans to spoil the Azures' party here tonight but not with play like that. Iaquinta. Iaquinta. Kuffour slips. Iaquinta rounds the goalkeeper. It's a win for Italy now surely. Samuel Kuffour is absolutely inconsolable. And he'll remember this moment for the rest of his life. And for all the wrong reasons, so will Kuffour. - [Commentator] Poborsky. Grygera. Koller. What a start for the Czech Republic. Grygera's probing cross right onto the head of Jan Koller. They're very easy on the eye. Nedved. Rosicky. A delightful move here by the Czech Republic. He knew exactly where he was placing that ball. Rosicky. Nedved. And Rosicky. Is this goal number three for the Czech Republic? Was there ever any doubt? Another breathtaking move by the Czech Republic ends with Rosicky claiming his second goal of the game. - [Commentator] It'll be an Andrea Pirlo free kick for the Italian side. And he'll try and curl it away from the keeper. Brilliant goal. Italy lead here and Alberto Gilardino does what he couldn't do in the Champions League. He flies in with a header. It's his first World Cup goal for his country. It's Italy one, USA nil. There's the chance. Sliced into his own goal. Surely it's an own goal by Zaccardo. And he cannot believe it. Well, it's almost a faint smile on his face. And a wringing of the wrists. What an unlikely way for team America to strike back. How extraordinary. Zaccardo seems to lose concentration almost. - [Commentator] Cech beats it away, it was a tricky corner kick, very close to the goalkeeper. Cech was taking no chances at all. Appiah. And an opening here for Ghana who score early on. Gyan is on target. Picked out by his captain. African football is in delirium here. Gyan's the man. Appiah directing operations. No offside, Gyan, Appiah, Gyan. Muntari. Oh, he's beaten Cech now. That was unstoppable by Muntari. It appears Ghana are gonna win this game. The Czechs appeal for offside and this time there was nothing Petr Cech could do. - [Commentator] Roma legend Totti will take this. Materazzi. He's only been on from the bench for a matter of moments. And Marco Materazzi, his first ever Italian goal. And what a stage to score it. It's only the injury to Nesta that saw him brought onto the field but it was a great finish here. It's Inzaghi who is through. One on one with the goalkeeper. How's his confidence? It's not bad is it? Filippo Inzaghi has the beating of Petr Cech. Italy have the beating of the Czech Republic. Marcello Lippi's side will stride into the final 16 as group winners of Group E. - [Commentator] Reyna's lost out here. It's Draman. Goal for Ghana. Claudio Reyna, the US skipper lies prone on the turf but he it was who lost possession to Haminu Draman. Now here is the moment. No I don't think there's anything wrong with that. Draman right to be waved on. Ghana don't have to worry about what's happening in Hamburg between Italy and the Czech Republic because they know if they win, then they are through. Good ball in, it's Dempsey, goal. Brilliant. Clint Dempsey. Don't discount just yet the fight, the heart, and the vigor and verve of the USA. Waking pass looking for Amoah who is very quick. Bocanegra's filled with work to do here. Amoah's won the header. And the referee says penalty. Pushed by Onyewu on Pimpong. Well he can't believe it, Bruce Arena, but Markus Merk had a perfect view. And what a dramatic finale to the first half here in Nurnberg. Stephen Appiah. The Ghana captain with the opportunity to put his side back in front. First half stoppage time. Ghana are in control again. - [Narrator] With the Czech's campaign blighted by injuries and the US failing to spark, Ghana were the surprise package following Italy through to be the only African nation in the second round. (dramatic music) Few look beyond the reigning champions Brazil to top Group F with Australia, Croatia, and Japan expected to be battling for second spot. - [Commentator] Here comes another Brazilian move. It's Kaka. It's terrific. It's the first Brazilian goal of the 2006 FIFA World Cup finals. It only takes a moment. It only takes an inch of a chance. - [Commentator] Up they go. Schwarzer flaps at it, the goal will stand. The ball is in the net and Japan have a goal. Schwarzer will feel he was booked and he sits there in dismay. There's no doubt about it, Schwarzer just couldn't do anything about it and Nakamura has given Japan the lead here. Long one from Neill and Kawaguchi doesn't get to this and the ball's going in. Australia score for the first time ever in the World Cup finals and the name is Tim Cahill. And as the ball flies loose, it is Cahill from the English Premiership club Everton who manages to get boot to ball. Australia are really going for it now. Cahill, it's his day. Is it ever, is it ever Tim Cahill's day? Cometh the hour, cometh the man for Australia. What a magnificent comeback for the Australians. I said you'd never, ever count them out and it's taken a man called Cahill to come up with the goods for them. Kennedy now will go one on one here. They're so tired those players, they can hardly run. Aloisi's got Viduka ahead of him, probably in an offside position. Aloisi, three one. Australia win it. What a golden day for the Gold Coast. And John Aloisi who's penalty destroyed Uruguay in the shootout has just struck a blow to the heart of Japan and Australia have a win in the World Cup finals, their first ever. - [Commentator] It's through here now for Ronaldo. Little side steps. Adriano. Goal for Brazil, Adriano strikes his first in the World Cup finals and it's just what not only Brazil needed, but the game needed, too. Ronaldo played his part here, slipping it across, and Adriano on his favored left boot tucked it away. Ronaldinho. For Fred. Almost casual Fred there, his attempt to pass the ball. This might be the moment. Must be the moment, the ball is dribbled over the line. Brazil are home and dry now. Fred's been on the field two minutes and he's scored a goal. Brazil two, Australia nil. And it's the yellow of Brazil that celebrates tonight and not the yellow of Australia. - [Commentator] Inamoto. That's a great ball by Inamoto. Alex. Tamada. One nil to Japan. He's scored some spectacular goals but that one will be his most cherished of his career. Juninho. Ronaldinho. Great vision to pick out Cicinho. Ronaldo. It just had to be Ronaldo. 13 goals now in the World Cup finals. Only needs one more to equal Gerd Mueller's World Cup record. It's his first goal of the 2006 FIFA World Cup finals. Juninho. It's a belter. That ball dipped and swerved and snaked its way past Kawaguchi. Ronaldinho. What a great ball. Gilberto. Gilberto makes it three one. Look at this, Ronaldo. Swap passes with Juan. And poor old Kawaguchi. Gerd Mueller's record at the FIFA World Cup finals has now been equaled. - [Commentator] Can Croatia find their first goal of the World Cup finals as early as the third minute here? That's what they're aiming for and it's through. They certainly can. It was magnificently struck by Darijo Srna. What a start for Croatia. What a start for Zlatko Kranjcar. And what a start for Darijo Srna. Can Emerton be clever here with a cross? It's not a bad looking one. And there's a shout for a penalty and it's gonna be given by referee Poll. It's Stjepan Tomas, I don't think he's gonna complain. It's a hand ball. Craig Moore, a defender, strikes the goal that brings the green and gold level. They will be roaring back in Melbourne, in Sydney, in Perth, and Canberra. It's one one here. Crowd roar every time they think there might be a shot on and there is a shot on here. What a mistake made by the goalkeeper. Niko Kovac restores the lead for Croatia but horror for goalkeeper Kalac, the one who's been brought in for Mark Schwarzer tonight. His mind will be racing. Australia's done by how many they commit forward as long as they get a goal. Bresciano. There'll be such a celebration if they do and here's a moment for them. Chance surely, goal number two, Harry Kewell is the name. He got the goals against Iran in the World Cup qualifiers all those years ago when the Australians didn't make it to the finals. They've made it now and he has his first goal of the calendar year for the Roos. - [Narrator] Australia's draw in that crucial final game kept Croatia at bay. Japan briefly gave Brazil a scare but their goal was the only one the champions conceded as they cruised through. (dramatic music) A favorable draw for France though in qualifying they couldn't beat the Swiss. Korea Republic hope to repeat their feats of four years earlier. Togo's chances seem slim. - [Commentator] Well there's an opening here. Kader. Goal to Togo. Africa celebrates. Kader put through, took his chance quite brilliantly. Lee Chun-soo. One one. Togo have paid the ultimate price. They have a player sent off. And from the resulting free kick, Lee Chun-soo sends these Korean fans absolutely wild. Ahn Jung-hwan. He's done it again just as he did four years ago. Ahn Jung-hwan. The tormentor of Italy returns to the World Cup stage and scores a customary goal. - [Commentator] Korea are dispossessed but here's Makelele. Touch and attempt by Wiltord who's shot will fall to Thierry Henry. Eight minutes played and the French are finally, finally off the mark. It's taken an awful long time for them to score a World Cup finals goal. You'd have put your mortgage on this man breaking the drought. Are France a little too relaxed about this situation? Will they be made to pay? Here's Seol Ki-hyeon, the substitute. That's a great ball over. Headed back and in. Yes it is, it's. And it's an equalizer. Park Ji-sung will claim the final touch. Now the party commences. - [Commentator] Magnin joins the attack, the full back. Races past Toure. Over the head of Frei. Frei scores. Barnetta turned it back to Frei who missed the initial cross but then thumped the ball in. It's love at first sight. Time is running out here for Togo. Magnin's overrun it and Magnin could be through. And Lustrinelli who's just come on as a sub. Barnetta. Three minutes to go, it's perfect Swiss timing. Victory for the Swiss ensured here by Barnetta's goal. - [Commentator] Ribery. Pulls it back here towards Vieira. Patrick Vieira could well be the savior of the French team. It's the birthday boy, 30 today. And Vieira has scored a goal which could, and I underline the word could, take France into the last 16. Vieira. And Henry. That could be the goal which sends France through. Goal number 35 for France for Thierry Henry. Great header there by Vieira. - [Commentator] Tranquillo Barnetta. Hakan Yakin's free kick. A header, goal, Switzerland. Philippe Senderos. Bloodied he may be. But a goal scorer and a very happy one at that. Cabanas. One of the no frills players in the Swiss midfield. Does a good job for the team though. Offside, now they're unhappy about that. Frei has scored, is it gonna count? It is. Well everything seemed to stop but it's the right decision for me. Because the Swiss players initially reacted that the flag had gone up against them when the last touch and the ball fed Frei came from a Korean player. - [Narrator] Togo's tournament was ruined by. Korea couldn't quire recapture their 2002 spirit while the misfiring French were ultimately just please to qualify behind Switzerland. (dramatic music) Spain look strong favorites in Group H but previous tournament failures meant nobody was ruling out Ukraine and Tunisia with Saudi Arabia potentially tricky, too. - [Commentator] First real chance for Spain. And they follow it up with a goal. Well worked corner kick. Touched in at the near post. Spain have the lead. It's Villa. Oh, it's two for Spain. David Villa. Well there was the deflection. That's what caught the goalkeeper up. Andriy Shevchenko. Pablo deals it away. Torres is onside. Torres, has he got the pace of the finish? Goalkeeper remains solid. It wasn't the best of efforts in the end from Torres. I think he just tried to slide it through. And the referee has given what here? The referee has shown the red card. Vashchuk is off. Now was there contact here? A slight pull there outside the penalty area. And apart from that, well very little. He's a picture of concentration. It's Villa. It's a save but only into the back of the net. Shovkovskiy got down, did ever so well and got his hand to it, but Villa again with the help of a Ukrainian touch, finds the back of the net. It has gone a okay for Spain so far. Everything they would have wanted in this game has happened. Three goals. Haven't conceded. Might get a fourth here. Torres. What a strike. Venomous attack. They sprung forward with real purpose and Torres lashes home a fourth for Spain. - [Commentator] And that's not a bad looking ball. It nearly got through, big chance, goal. Rammed into the back of the net by Zied Jaziri and Tunisia one, Saudi Arabia nil. Just what the game needed if not exactly what Saudi Arabia needed. Very, very good ball in behind the full back, now he needs a good cross as well from Mohammed Noor. It's a super goal. Absolutely super goal struck by Saudi Arabia who are right back in this game. No wonder they stand and applaud, it was a perfectly constructed goal. And that's a lovely piece of play and there's a spare man here. What a chance this is for Saudi Arabia to win it. And he's won it. He's won it I think. Sami Al Jaber writes another chapter in a golden history for Saudi Arabia. Sami Al Jaber, cap number 161, goal number 44. Danger, too, in there, it might even be more than danger. It could be an equalizer if they can get this right. It is. Radhi Jaidi from Bolton Wanderers in England. Steals into the six yard area and Tunisia get their just deserts. It looked like Sami Al Jaber had got a winner. - [Commentator] Jaziri brushes off Puyol. Some play here by Jaziri. Pablo to meet him but still Jaziri. Can he get the shot away? He's got support now. Casillas with the save and a goal for Tunisia, Mnari. Less than eight minutes gone. And Tunisia are in front. This is Fernando Torres who will step over Fabregas. Raul is in there. And Spain's record goal scorer strikes again. They were trying to write him off but you can't write off a player of his pedigree. Inside the FIFA World Cup stadium in Stuttgart, Raul's equalizer really raised their hopes. And here's Fernando Torres. Timed his run beautifully and scores. The player they call El Nino in Spain. Looks for Torres. Now has the referee given a penalty here? I think he has. Torres with the chance to firmly settle this match in Group H in Stuttgart. Which he does. Not, I have to say, in the most convincing fashion. Brushed off the arm of Boumnijel. But ultimately good enough. - [Commentator] Referee's not happy with something. Khariri just being warned about his holding inside the penalty area. Oh and it's bungled in, bungled in by Andriy Rusol with barely three minutes played. Ukraine's World Cup is up and running finally. Tymoshchuk. Serhiy Rebrov and again he goes for goal and scores a quite wonderful goal as well. Helpless, utterly helpless Mabrouk Zaid. Well it'll be a free kick right at the start of the second half. It was an early goal in the first. Kalinichenko was the provider and here he is providing again and Shevchenko gets the third of the afternoon. The right boots of Kalinichenko providing again and this time the more likely route of Shevchenko with the header. Heres a legend of Ukraine, closing in maybe on goal number four. Unselfish play and a great finish by Kalinichenko. It's the final moment of magic from Ukraine's point of view. The Spanish defeat is all but forgotten now. - [Commentator] They do have a free kick here for Reyes to send in. And it's not a bad one. Oh, what a classic goal. That's an absolutely top draw magnificent header from Juanito. Spain have the lead. Saudi Arabia have problems. - [Commentator] Shevchenko is the target, Jaidi is the man to cut it out. He doesn't do so. Shevchenko keeps his feet belatedly decides to go down. Referee has given a penalty. It's Shevchenko against Boumnijel. Shevchenko, delightful. Cushioned into the back of the net. No doubt about the quality of the penalty kick. It's Ukraine who have the lead now by one goal to nil. - [Narrator] While Tunisia and Saudi Arabia ultimately fell short, Ukraine recovered well from their dreadful opening match. The manner of Spain's progress suggested this might finally be their year. (dramatic music) Some fancied sides were sure to depart in the second round with Spain facing France and Portugal playing the Netherlands. The hosts had Sweden, dangerous opponents. - [Commentator] Aimed in here. There might be a German opportunity still. There are three around this area with Ballack and then Klose. The goalkeeper's made the stop but the ball is in the net. Germany have won exactly what they wanted. It's taken them less than four minutes this time. Munich erupts to the goal by Lukas Podolski. Germany one, Sweden nil. Longer ball in there, Klose hustling. It was bobbling around all over. Podolski. There's a cross here from Miroslav Klose. Oh, it's a lovely little ball and Podolski's got two. Germany two, Sweden nil. They've already got one foot in the quarter finals. The two Polish born players who lead the line for Germany are leading it to perfection. - [Commentator] Pavel Pardo will take this. There are five in green shirts waiting in the middle. Little flicked header and it's in. Marquez, Rafael Marquez after five minutes. And they deserve it. We've got a game on our hands. Crespo trying to find the space. Riquelme gets it over, Crespo has headed it in, it's an own goal. It's an equalizer. And I think it was Borgetti who might have put it in his own net. Let's have a look. Well, it surely, surely came off the head of Borgetti here. Maybe Crespo did get a touch. He'll certainly claim it. Messi. Sorin. All the way to the back edge of the penalty area to Rodriguez. On the left foot, what a goal. What a strike. If ever there was a score that deserved to win a game in these circumstances, that was it. It was Sorin's ball across. It was taken on the chest by Rodriguez and then my word. Sanchez did not stand a chance. Look at that, on the volley. - [Commentator] Posh Spice looks on and hopes, as the rest of England hopes. It is David Beckham and it's useful. Beckham scores for England. Posh Spice leads the applause, the breakthrough comes from the captain, much maligned but his 17th goal for his country promises much for England. It promises a place in the quarterfinals. - [Commentator] Deco. Into Pauleta. One nil to Portugal and it's the man who scored the winner against the Netherlands in the European championship semifinal who's done it again. Maniche. Deco here to Pauleta. And when the opening came, Maniche didn't miss. The Netherlands must be heartily sick of Maniche. - [Commentator] There are 50 seconds to go before extra time and a 30 minute bonus for you. Have they settled for it these two? Well, they've stood toe to toe and they've traded the blows but it's beginning to look as though were gonna have another 30 minutes to try and settle it and then it will be survival of the fittest. Totti. Grosso. And still Grosso. He's done brilliantly. Play on says the referee. No, it's gonna be a penalty kick for the Italians. Lucas Neill cannot believe it and Fabio Grosso has wanted to snatching this one in the very last second. Grosso lumbered on. Neill went to ground. Grosso fell over his prostrate body. I think it's no more than debatable. It looks a shocker of a decision to be honest. It's Totti versus Schwarzer. This to send Italy into the last eight. And how cruel it will be on Australia. That Italy go through. Totti is the name. Totti's done the Italian job for them. And the three times champions Italy have scrambled home thanks to Franceso Totti's brilliantly struck penalty kick. And that was the moment that Italy continued their march towards the final and the Australian dream ended. - [Commentator] Barnetta is the next penalty taker. Chance to make it one one on penalties. He needs to score this one. Oh, he's missed it. Two penalties for the Swiss and two failures. Slams the ball against the crossbar. Next is Cabanas. He really has to score this otherwise they're right down to the wire. He doesn't look happy, he just doesn't look happy at all. And he's saved it. Three misses. I just felt he didn't look confident. Ukraine are one kick away from the last eight and a meeting with Italy. If they score this, they're through. Husyev. He's done it, they're through. Ukraine are through to the last eight. Switzerland become the first team to be eliminated at a World Cup finals without conceding a goal. Oleg Husyev from Dynamo Kiev. At the time of the last World Cup he was playing in the third division in Ukraine. Ukraine win three nil on penalty kicks. - [Commentator] Emerson. Almost playing in the defense at the moment but he really is the link between defense and midfield. I think Ghana will try and harry Brazil out of their stride. They played a very high line here, they're onside. Ronaldo, is this the record? It sure is. No one now has scored more goals in the history of the FIFA World Cup finals than Ronaldo. Player at the bottom of your picture was playing them on. It was a horrific error. There was a player who tried to challenge Ronaldo right at the end who had played the entire Brazilian attack onside. What a dreadful error that was. Poor old Paintsil. He'll have nightmares about that. Muntari. Muntari just hesitated crucially before shooting. Three minutes of stoppage time to be added on. Onside here. They're queuing up. Kaka. Cafu. It's Adriano. We do have a goal before halftime but it's for Brazil. The man who broke the deadlock against Australia has made it two nil to the world champions here in Dortmund. Again Ghana played a high line up the pitch. Was there an offside there? Cafu delivered the telling cross and Adriano has got his name on the score sheet again. Ghana desperately try and win the ball back. That's really why Brazil are world champions, they can control the game. They can control the tempo, they can control the passing. When they have to mix it and be physical, they can do that as well. They're stringing all these passes together to try and emulate Argentina. Is it gonna be a great goal here? It is, you know. This is gonna be one of the great goals of the World Cup. So many passes, so many great touches. At the end of it Ze Roberto is through and Brazil are safely delivered into the last eight of the World Cup finals. Again onside and poor old Ghana's offside has not really worked today. Ze Roberto is not a regular goal scorer at international level. - [Commentator] This looks a dangerous back post. Headed away and picked up by Xabi Alonso. And the referee's gonna give the penalty kick. Pablo I think it was. And the French are surrounding referee Rosetti from Torino. Pablo it was and Lilian Thuram into the back of Pablo. Contact is made and any referee who sees contact like that from the position Senor Rosetti was in will say penalty. Non says Monsieur Domenech. Si says Rosetti. It is David Villa. He scores and Spain lead. Spain one, France nil. What a breakthrough it is for the team that has come into the match possibly as the favorites. The team that has so far underachieved throughout its entire history apart from one European championship triumph. David Villa's fourth goal for his country. Raul trying to combine with Xabi Alonso. Vieira. It's opened up this time, he's onside here. Big, big chance for Ribery but shall he equalize? France are level and it was a touch of genius from Ribery. Well, he's away and running down the touchline into the arms of the entire French squad. He has breathed new life into the World Cup challenge for the French. And will he ever score a more important one? Lovely ball here. Patrick Vieira, Henry was offside by miles. But Ribery wasn't so the flag stayed down. He still had to go beyond Casillas. He still had to roll it into the net and with two Spanish defenders converging on the ball, neither could keep it out of the net and France are level again. Well played Franck Ribery. And a French free kick. The French have plenty forward as Zidane takes it. It's away and. Patrick Vieira may have won the match for France. The Spanish were all over the place. Let's have a look at it. It got a flick on there and Vieira. Puyol was one. The goalkeeper couldn't keep it out, neither could Sergio Ramos. France are two minutes away from their success. Two minutes away from triumph. Spain two minutes away from elimination and only three or four days ago people were talking about them as potential winners. France have a break on here. It's angled across to Zidane. Can he finish it once and for all? Zinedine Zidane, three one. France are in the quarterfinals. It's Zizou and it's goodbye Spain I'm afraid again. Once again all the dreams of the Spanish have evaporated. Destroyed by the world champions of 1998. Zidane has scored against Spain in the first international ever played at the Stade de France. Kept his position, stayed onside, kept cool. Went inside Puyol and drove the ball wide of his Real Madrid colleague Iker Casillas to send France into a date with Brazil. - [Narrator] The host nation's momentum showed no sign of slowing. Argentina next would be their greatest test. England had yet to perform to their full potential. But Portugal were brimming with confidence after a fiery win. Italy got lucky at the last. While Ukraine were starting to find their stride. Brazil had ended Africa's representation. France could be harder to stop. That repeat of the 1998 final was eagerly awaited. Brazil had a score to settle. But kicking off the quarterfinals, Germany's unmissable clash with Argentina. - [Commentator] Most of Argentina's players congregate on the edge of the penalty area as a nervousness descends over the stadium. Riquelme with a corner. Over Sorin's head, a free header, it's in. It's Ayala and Argentina have the lead. Jens Lehman is furious with either himself or his defenders. And Argentina perhaps can send the semifinals of the World Cup. Roberto Ayala who's played more than 100 times for his country, has only ever scored six goals prior to today. How important a goal will that be? Germany have not been behind at these World Cup finals. They are now. Will Germany's physical training come to the rescue now? Ballack. Chipped on here, they're level. Miroslav Klose rescues Germany. It's one one. He's not scored a headed goal for Germany for three years. He has now. Clearly onside. He is a leading goal scorer of the World Cup finals. It's penalties to decide who wins this quarterfinal in Berlin. Even I've got butterflies in my stomach. This to make it two two on penalties. Advantage Germany. This to make it four two. Germany in touching distance now. Cambiasso to try and keep Argentina in the World Cup. He's saved it, Germany are through. The Olympic Stadium at Berlin explodes into noise and color because Germany have done it. One or two tears out there. They came from behind. Found an equalizer with 10 minutes to go and kept their nerve in the penalty shootout with some big saves from Jens Lehman. Germany are World Cup semifinalists. They win four two on penalties. - [Commentator] Here's a good run from Zambrotta. What a goal from Gianluca Zambrotta. He's only ever scored one in his entire life before. It's two now and what a goal for Lippi to celebrate. The 29 year old Zambrotta who missed the start of the World Cup with injury, he's alive and kicking now. Wonderful, wonderful strike and it flew in off the fingers of Shovkovskiy and Italy have the early goal. Corner for Italy. 50,000 here in Hamburg. Totti now, useful ball in, they've got their second and Luca Toni has his first World Cup goal. They're on their way to play Germany now you would feel. Cannavaro didn't get a touch, Luca Toni, the man who got 30 semi odd goals last season for Fiorentina has come diving in here to send Italy soaring into a two goal lead. Here we're surely witnessing Italy's progression into the last four. And a run here from Zambrotta. It must be three unless he's offside, is he? Toni having not got a goal in four games has got two in less than 10 minutes. Ukraine are torn asunder and I have a funny feeling they might go on and lose this one as heavily as they lost their first match. So two for Toni. And he scored just before the hour mark and this is made by the man who set Italy on their way tonight, Gianluca Zambrotta, turning up there, slipping the ball through, no question of offside and tapped simply into the net by Luca Toni who has two goals in 10 minutes. - [Commentator] Penalties to decide it. Portugal against England. Jamie Carragher. England have only scored one penalty so far. He can't watch. I'm not sure I can. He's a monster, that guy, at saving penalties. Nerves are drawn so tight to breaking point. Carragher. He's saved it. Ricardo is proving to be the Portuguese hero once again. Portugal are one kick away from the World Cup semifinals. The tormentor of England, Cristiano Ronaldo. The man who was involved in the incident with Wayne Rooney that saw Rooney sent off. Cristiano Ronaldo can send Portugal to their first World Cup semifinal in 40 years. Is the waiting over here for Portugal? It is. Portugal are World Cup semifinalists and England, as usual, lose on a penalty shootout. History has repeated itself. He's got the beating of England again. It's the end for Sven-Goran Eriksson. His reign as England manager ends via a penalty shootout. Who could have believed it? Just one successful penalty for England scored by Owen Hargreaves. Three successful penalties for Portugal. - [Commentator] Free kick here for the French and the tall man Vieira is up there. So is, so will be Gallas. Danger now, here is a big, big chance. France have the lead. Thierry Henry has stooped for the glory and it's Brazil nil France one. They call him terrific Thierry in France and in London and Thierry Henry has brought the contest to light. He's brought Raymond Domenech to his feet. He's got every French arm in the whole of the country and in the whole of the stadium in Frankfurt waving in salute. No question of onside, it's stowing away. But where were the markers? They were all preoccupied with others and Henry took full advantage to prod it home. - [Narrator] For the first time since 1982, all the semifinalists were European and all of them but Portugal had lifted the trophy before. The pedigree of the final four was impeccable. (dramatic music) - [Commentator] Two minutes of extra time remain. Still goalless in the World Cup semifinal. And it's Del Piero with a corner. Pirlo. - [Commentator] It's Grosso, Italy surely are through to Berlin. - [Commentator] Germany have been silenced. What a time to score. - [Commentator] Are you kidding me? Fantastic little ball by Pirlo inside the fall back. Brilliantly struck by Grosso. Right in the top corner. Fantastic goal. Oh my goodness, what a brilliantly taken goal. - [Commentator] What timing by the Italians. Germany have to score now. It's now or never for Germany. Is the party over for them? Podolski. Cannavaro. The Azure are moments from glory. Gilardino. Del Piero. Berlin here we come. The tears will flow here in Dortmund from the German fans. Alex Del Piero with the last kick of the game. Victory for Italy. They make the World Cup final as they've done every 12 years since 1970. - [Commentator] Well, what fantastic play by Italy on the counterattack. Germany kept going forwards. Beautiful little ball into Del Piero. He bends it into the top corner. Brilliantly taken goal. - [Commentator] Malouda. Clever little touch. The referee's gonna give the spot kick. Thierry Henry taken down. The Portuguese can't defend it. It's always a dangerous ploy and Ricardo Carvalho has taken out Thierry Henry in the opinion of Senor Larrionda here and the game will open up now if France score from the spot kick. - [Commentator] Tell you what, I'm not so sure. Certainly Carvalho. They're tight enough. It's not the biggest of nudges and I think had the ball not have run away from Henry as far as it had, he'd have gone after it to get a shot away. There's definitely a little bit of contact with Carvalho's left leg. It's enough, John, it's just enough. - [Commentator] Well, it's such a massive call for a referee in any game let alone a World Cup semifinal but here he comes, Zizou, to try and score his second World Cup goal of 2006 and he's up against one of the best shot stoppers in terms of penalties in the world in Ricardo. He's not taking much of a run up here. It's Zidane to give France the lead in the semifinal in Munich. And it's his World Cup at the moment. Zinedine Zidane belts it home via the fingers of Ricardo who got very, very close to keeping it out and the big man Zizou shows absolutely no emotion. They certainly do. It is Portugal nil, France one. - [Commentator] There's many different ways to take a penalty, we've seen lots of players in the tournament so far with long run ups etc. Zidane just a couple of strides and popping it in the corner. Ricardo went the right way but it got half a fingertip to it. Just a bit too powerful. - [Narrator] Italy's stunning finish had dashed the German dream. In Berlin, the Azure would face France, an aging side reviving memories of their glory days when it really mattered. There was one last chance for Germany to party. Pride and third place at stake in Stuttgart. - [Commentator] Germany break. The game's still in the balance, 55 minutes played, nil nil the score. Schweinsteiger on the ball. No substitutions as yet. So Schweinsteiger will look for a shot in here. It's a thrilling shoot, it's a thrilling goal from Bastian Schweinsteiger. He took aim and it was deadly aim. He scored in the pre World Cup warm up friendly matches but it's his first in seven games at the World Cup of 2006 and the 21 year old who has been building a reputation with Bayern Munich in the last two years has brought Germany the lead against Portugal. Germany one, Portugal nil. And the name is Bastian Schweinsteiger. And he did it all himself, in fact, he had to evade the Japanese referee who nearly fell over in his path. But Schweinsteiger looks up here and really lets fly. And that's what they mean about this ball moving in the air. It certainly beat Ricardo and it flew between the Portuguese goalkeeper's fingers and into the net, one nil Germany. Another promising position. Can they go two ahead? With Schweinsteiger's free kick. Interesting lack of Klose in there and Metzelder. He'll probably go for goal. Oh, it's an own goal. It's two nil Germany. Nobody in a white shirt can claim this one. Petit stuck out his boot and there wasn't a hope in the world for Ricardo. It's an own goal, Schweinsteiger taking much of the credit, but there's no way he can claim it. It's a Petit own goal. In other words a little own goal but a big one for Germany. Germany two, Portugal nil, surely they cannot be stopped now. Sliced in by Petit from the Schweinsteiger drive. Though he may have been going wide otherwise, but Petit has just probably handed third place to Germany. That's as clear an own goal as you can see really, that. Neuville, a lovely turn on a runaway from the defender as well and then feeding the ball out to the hitter of the night, Bastian Schweinsteiger who looks like scoring every time he lets fly. Does he ever, does he ever, Bastian Schweinsteiger, this is your night. Well Juergen Klinsmann could not have hit a better one himself. He's only been denied a hat trick via the boot of Petit. Michael Schumacher beams as though he's just had the flag as he crossed the finishing line in a Grand Prix. Bastian Schweinsteiger with goal number nine in only his 35th appearance is the star of the future. He's a pretty good star of the present as well. How's he hit this one? Ricardo never saw it, it absolutely flew into the net, it nearly burst it and we got goals for you now, though they're all German goals. Bend it like Bastian. Three nil Germany and what a night for him. Tournament lost a little bit of something when the host went out. Portugal do deserve a goal for their efforts in this half and Figo fires a ball in and they do have a goal. Lovely, lovely header from Nuno Gomes has stunned the German public here. It's belated consolation for Scolari. And a lovely goal for Nuno Gomes, his 24th for Portugal. They're happy about that and the three one score line was something many of us predicted and that's what we've got at the moment and it's Luis Figo cross as well. A beauty curling onto his head and Kahn, for all his efforts, has been beaten on the night, he'd be mortified by that. But just with all the other goals this evening, there was nothing much the goalkeeper could do about it. Luis Figo with a lovely cross here at least has given Nuno Gomes a World Cup goal to celebrate. And it's Germany three, Portugal one with 87 minutes played. - [Narrator] The hosts said farewell to their own tournament with a bang. Juergen Klinsmann's young side unable to go all the way but they more than satisfied expectations. The pre tournament critics have been silenced with high tempo attractive football that had the nation enthralled. All that remained was one final match to crown the 2006 FIFA world champions. For Zinedine Zidane, the last game of an illustrious career would be a chance to win the World Cup for a second time. Opponents Italy were looking for a silver lining with their domestic game embroiled in a corruption scandal. 69,000 fans were in Berlin to witness the competition's finale. The drama did not disappoint. - [Commentator] The other move going here which will involve Camoranesi, the Argentine born player, off to Grosso on the left who's a key component for them as well. You're talking about Henry being a key component. I suppose everybody is in this game. Oh, that has to be a free kick. That wasn't followed through. And this might just be a yellow card as well. It is for Zambrotta. First of the match and he really into the man. - [Commentator] Yeah, it was late wasn't it and dangerous. - [Commentator] Not quite sure what he's appealing about there. It is a yellow card for a man who missed the European 2000 final against France because he'd had a red card in the semifinal. Now a chance for Malouda. He's down, penalty. A penalty for the French. Well shades of Germany and the World Cup finals of 1974 when Holland were awarded a penalty in the very first minute and Johan Neeskens scored for the Netherlands then against Germany. Here down goes Malouda and Zinedine Zidane will have the chance to get a penalty in the final in Berlin. - [Commentator] Malouda has gone down inside penalty and I think rather fortunately. - [Commentator] Zidane on the last occasion he took a penalty whacked it hard to the goalkeeper's right and if you remember the Portuguese goalkeeper Ricardo got a hand to it. It's Zinedine Zidane here. It crossed the line, it's a goal, but how lucky almost is that? How casual, how cheeky? Only one of the world's great, great players would attempt anything as audacious as that but he nearly paid the penalty if you'll excuse the pun. - [Commentator] Well I guess any penalty that ultimately counts as a goal but that was mighty cheeky and indeed having clipped the crossbar he set the goalkeeper down, clipped it over the keeper, it hits the crossbar, and the referee's assistant on the far side, he's perfectly positioned, he sits on that goal line so he can make any call on whether the ball goes over the line and indeed it did. Zidane opens the scoring. - [Commentator] Camoranesi managed to fool Abidal there. He read the flight of the ball better. He's in a position to try and win a corner at least here and that's what he will do. He's got a lot of ability Camoranesi. Doesn't always, I think, sort of round things off. He doesn't always get the good final ball in that his ability demands. - [Commentator] Well, he certainly works himself into good positions and I don't actually think he wants to take this corner either particularly, it's Pirlo who normally delivers from set plays and we've also got a little bit of a skirmish in the middle of the penalty area which the referee has sorted out. - [Commentator] Pirlo's corner, Italy trail by a goal. And they're level. It's Toni, it's the big fellow from the back, Materazzi who does to France what he did to the Czech Republic. He climbs into the set piece and a thumping header from the center back Marco Materazzi. Has brought Italy right back into this game and nothing was gonna stop this one. - [Commentator] Well, it was a powerful header, wasn't it? What a great climb but the delivery made it. Pirlo, we'd already spoken about his delivery. And great power from Materazzi. Patrick Vieira doing his best to get a challenge on it. Couldn't climb high enough and the big Italian central defender with a powerful header. - [Commentator] Italy one, France one. Fasten your seatbelts for the penalty shootout. - [Narrator] Zidane's swan song had turned sour, sent off in extra time. And there was worse to come for the French, facing the shootout without their legendary leader. - [Commentator] Trezeguet now. To keep France level. It's not crossed the line, he's missed, it definitely did not cross the line a la Zidane. And it's the first miss and it's advantage Italy. Buffon didn't have to do anything. It's gonna be Grosso. Yep. Fabio Grosso. Lippi knows that this is the moment for the young defender, the young man here from Palermo, to win Italy the World Cup. He does it. It's Italy's cup and the man who scored the goal, that broke German hearts, is the man who is immortalized his name in Italian football history. He's off and running. He's already gone the whole length of the field. They're not bothering to chase him and Italy are the world champions of 2006. - [Commentator] From minute one to minute 120 plus penalties. - [Commentator] And a reckless act of idiocy, of lunacy by Zinedine Zidane has contributed to the French defeat. Who would have believed it and who would have believed that this young man Fabio Grosso who scored the goal that broke German hearts has now scored the goal that has broken French hearts, too. - [Commentator] Well, just wonderful scenes of delight. Absolute delight, players, management, coaches, fans. - [Commentator] And Fabio Cannavaro, for me the man of the series, steps up now and he is the man who will lift the trophy to the heavens. It's the Azures blue year of 2006. Italy are the world champions for the fourth time in their history. - [Narrator] The Italians were the winners of an outstanding tournament. For 31 thrilling days, the entire globe was gripped. There was joy and pain on the road to Berlin, happiness and heartbreak, but no one will ever forget the FIFA World Cup Germany 2006. (dramatic music)
