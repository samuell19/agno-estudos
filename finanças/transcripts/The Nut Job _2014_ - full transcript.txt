SURLY: When yöu're an animal, life's a balancing act. Each day is a quest to find food to survive. It's a tough nut to crack. Wait, yöu think I'm one of these dopey pigeons? No, no, no, no, this is me. The handsome one. (COOING) I got no problem with my feathered friends. In fact, I get a real kick outta them. (SQUAWKS) They're really soft on the feet. And they're always building these little picnic baskets that offer the occasional treat. Apparently, not today. Thanks for nothing. (COOING) At the end of the day, I'm just like all yöu fine people. I'm no hero. I'm just a squirrel trying to get a nut. One bag of nuts, please. And that's my buddy named, well, Buddy. He don't talk much. Yeah, they say the world's there for the taking. So, that's just what we're gonna do. (CHILDREN LAUGHING) RACCOON: Come along. Please keep that food coming, everyone. That's it. All finds are valuable. (MOLE GRUNTING) Mole, what is our food level now? MOLE: Pickings are slim this year. (CHUCKLES) I'm sure we could rephrase. MOLE: (GRUNTS) We're at starvation levels! We're all gonna die! (ANIMALS MURMURING) Now, now, now, have optimism, brethren. Stiff upper lip, everyone. Ah! Here we are, food. (ALL GASPING) I'm afraid this is the wrong kind of nut. Hmm... Shiny. (CHIRPING) What's that? A nut cart? A nut cart? A nut cart? My eyes! RACCOON: This could be our salvation for winter. Andie! I'm on my way. yöu won't regret this. Uh-uh-uh. Grayson is going with yöu. With all due respect, sir, I can do this on my own. I don't... Grayson! Ole! (ALL SIGHING) Chicks dig the tail. (CLICKS TONGUE) RACCOON: Help Andie retrieve as many nuts from that cart as possible. For the park! ALL: For the park! Oh! What she said. And above all, keep a wary watchful eye out for yöu-know-who. No! Not him! Yes, him. Ho, ho, ho, come to daddy. Hey, mack, yöu know where the Oakton Bank is? Oh, thanks. (HORNS HONKING) Where'd yöu learn to drive? MAN: Moron! (CLICKING) (YAWNS) (CONTINUES CLICKING) GIRL: Hey, mister! I want some nuts. Scram, kid, we're closed. The sign says yöu're open! Burn rubber. Did yöu hear me? I want nuts! FINGERS: yöu want nuts? GIRL: Nuts! We got to get those nuts before the rest of the park gets in on this. Let's go over the plan. That's us, there's the cart, we rob the cart and then stuff ourselves silly all winter. (BUDDY WHISTLING) What are yöu looking at? Great. We got company. Okay, we got to move. Get in the pail. Officer, that man, he assaulted me with nuts. - Oh, no. - GIRL: It was horrible. Now, listen, Officer, that is not... I need to see yöur vendor permits. There it is. Enough food to feed the park for the entire winter. That dog will make it difficult, though. Grayson? Grayson? - Quiet. (SNIFFING) - ANDIE: What are yöu doing? I'm smelling for any sign of that rascal, Surly Squirrel. Picking up rather strange scents, though. Cashews, man musk, (SNEEZES) dog hair. I knew it. yöu stay here. Honestly, woman, I am still the park hero around here! (CLICKS TONGUE) Which reminds me, why haven't yöu asked me out on a date? Oh. (LAUGHS) (SNIFFING) I smell a rat. What are yöu doing here, Surly? (SCREAMS) FINGERS: Do yöu like cashews? yöu want some cashews? Who needs a permit when yöu got nuts? Great. So, yöu're after this nut cart, too, huh? Of course I am. The park needs it. Well, too late, sister. Amscray. Buddy and I got here first, and I ain't sharing. Oh, yes, yöu are. Fall's half over and the park's having the worst shortage in years. That nut cart can feed everyone. Hey, we'll work together. We can work out a deal. Uh, pass me that metal thingy, will yöu? (GROANS) I just... I don't get it. yöu have all the drive and ability to help the park, but yöu never do. yöu know, this is a chance to prove Raccoon is wrong about yöu. I don't care what Raccoon thinks. Well, then do it for the park. Stop thinking about yöurself all the time. Look, I'm independent and that means looking out for number one. I suggest yöu do the same if yöu want to survive. Got that? I feel sorry for yöu, Surly. A-ha! Found him, Andie! In a tree, no less. Very crafty, Surly. I shall now arrest yöu before yöu interfere with the park's nut cart caper. It's okay, Grayson. I got him. No, Grayson, she doesn't. yöu better help her. Well, yöu! I'm gonna... Hey, Sugar Ray, take the gloves off. I'm just gonna rip yöur tail off. Now, how about that date? Listen, I'd love to keep chatting, but I got a date with destiny. Destiny, do I know her? Buena suerte, chumps! That was thrilling! (GROANS) That was painful. (SIGHS) This is going to end up bad. LUCKY: Excuse me, Officer. I happen to have seen the whole thing. This little girl might be exaggerating a little bit... I am not! (GROANING) FINGERS: Did yöu see that? yöu're my witness. LUCKY: Did yöu see that, Officer? FINGERS: Yeah. Yeah, she assaulted me, Officer! I'm just an innocent citizen. Aren't I right? (SIGHS) Aww, great. (BARKING) (GRUNTS) (SNARLS) Bon appétit. (BLOWS RASPBERRY) (GROWLS) Hey, yöur cart, it's getting away. Holy Toledo! Amscray. (LAUGHING TRIUMPHANTLY) Uh-oh. Nuts! What a woman! (GRUNTING) (WHIMPERS) (INDISTINCT MUTTERING) That just cost yöu 10%. (SIGHS) Ole! Did I save the day? (ALL SCREAMING) Grayson, try to get as much food for the stock as yöu can. (SNIFFING) Hey, what's that smell? That's my cologne, made from tree sap and falcon tears. - Get back. - Hey, watch the tail. Flammable here, come on. These nuts are ours! Huh? These nuts are mine! Okay, Surly, let's negotiate. We can share it with the park. Yeah, that sounds fair. How about 100 me, zero for yöu? (GRUNTS) Wow! They definitely don't have a permit for that. (LAUGHING MANICALLY) No! We have to stop this cart. Photo op! (GRUNTING) Surly, come help me, man! What? Curse yöu, Surly! (LAUGHING) Surly, yöu coward! (SNICKERS) Heck of a day. Grayson, the oak tree. The tally is in. The food collected in the trunk of our oak tree (ALL GASP) will not be enough to carry us through winter. (ALL GROAN) I knew it! We're gonna die! - Settle down, settle down now, please. - Raccoon! (SHUSHING) Raccoon is giving a speech. Though this outlook appears disheartening... Excuse me, Andie and Grayson are on... with determination and honor... (CLICKING TONGUE) yöu gotta listen to me. this park will persevere! Take heart, park brethren, there is hope! (ALL GASPING) - Raccoon! - Quiet. I'd like to take this moment to point out... Quiet. Quiet. (LAUGHING) Grayson's never let us down before. I believe he is on his way right at this very moment carrying... Flaming cart of nuts! What? (GASPS) (ANIMALS SCREAMING) Our food! it will be destroyed! Why didn't yöu say anything? Abandon tree! Abandon tree! (GRUNTS) Not my perfectly symmetrical face! No! ALL: Phew! ANIMAL: My goodness! (POPCORN POPPING) Grayson? Grayson? Where are yöu? What happened here? (GROWLS) Who is responsible for this? SURLY: Let go of me, yöu clowns! (GRUNTS) yöu're making a big mistake here. I got an alibi! I got witnesses. (GROANS) Found him hiding in one of our holes, just like a snake. I was recovering buried nuts, that's what I was doing. (SNIFFING) yöu guys smell, like, burnt nuts or something? That me? What's going... Ahh! (LAUGHS) Look at that! yöu guys are messed for winter, man! I mean, wow! Just look at that bonfire! yöu didn't see that coming, did yöu? (SCREAMING) (GROANS) (ALL GASPING) Never fear! This sweet bod is undamaged! Raccoon, let me organize the trial. Just give the order. Another trial? He's never learned. He needs something more severe! He is a clear and present danger! yöu... No, no, we do things by the rule of law. Let justice take care of him. They want justice, Andie, and justice they will receive. All those in favor of banishment, raise yöur paws! - Banishment? - Banishment? Bandages? Yes, please. Why are yöu hesitating? He's refused to join us, ridiculed our hard work, stolen, cheated, lied, and now destroyed our only food for winter. What say all? And stick 'em up! Why is the ground moving towards my face? We don't convict without a trial. This isn't how we do things. Uh... I have run out of options for that squirrel, Andie. Do what yöu will, do what is right. Oh! (STAMMERS) Buddy has not voted, and it has to be unanimous, that's the rule. yöu won't vote against me, will yöu, old buddy? Buddy? yöu were saying? (GEESE HONKING) MOLE: By the authority granted by Raccoon and the park community... Oh! This is too high... Surly Squirrel is hereby banished to the city, never to return to our beloved Liberty Park. Ugh! Can I please get down now? yöu should have had a trial, Surly. I'm sorry. (CLICKS TONGUE) This is my punishment, Buddy. Huh. This ain't so bad. (GASPS) Ahh! (SCREAMS) (CHOKES) Oh! Filthy rat! (GRUNTS) (SIGHS) (YELLS) MAN: Hey! Whoa! Is that a rat? WOMAN: Oh, my! (SCREAMS) Shoes. Shoes. Gotta tail. (WOMAN SCREAMS) Hey! (THUNDER RUMBLING) (SIREN WAILING IN DISTANCE) (SNIFFLES) (THUDDING) (GROANS) (SCREAMS) No, no, no, Buddy, Buddy, Buddy, speak to me, pal, come on. Come on, snap out of it, come on, speak to me, pal, come on, come on, come on, snap out of it. (SIGHS) Boy, it feels good to have a... Hey, what are yöu doing? Get yöur hands off me. Beat it back to that park. It's dangerous out here. Besides, yöu'll just get in my way. I don't need anybody. (RUSTLING) yöu guys looking for that squirrel? Me, too. (CHUCKLES) Oops. (PANTING) (SHUSHING) (RATS SNARLING) (GASPS) Hey, fellas, come on, come on, come on. I'm cool with rats. My best friend's a rat. There he is! (SCREAMS) (BLOWS RASPBERRY) (ALL COOING NERVOUSLY) Go on, be free. Be free. Come on, come on, come on. (YELLS) Buddy, Buddy, come on! Here we go. (GRUNTING) We did it. We're away. Ha! (GASPS) (PIGEON SQUAWKING) Whoa! Let's go tell the boss. (SOBBING) I can't do this anymore. No food, no home. Rat gangs. I'm gonna die out here, Buddy. I don't know, I mean, maybe they could take me back. I'd do public service. I'll read to that blind woodchuck. I'll even listen to Raccoon. I'll do anything. I'll do whatever it takes to... (DANCE MUSIC PLAYING) Okay. We get in. We fill our bellies. But we do it my way. (JOINTS CRACKING) (SCREAMS) (WOMAN SCREAMS) (GRUNTING) Forget it, Buddy. That's not gonna work. Let me handle this. (CAR APPROACHING) FINGERS: We got 100. LUCKY: 20%. Twenty of 100, that's what 20% is. - yöu didn't go to school? - Hey, hey! Hey, hey! Look who's here! It's the boss! Fresh out of the slammer, huh? How yöu doing, jailbird? Hey, what's it been? Eight years? Seven years? Here. Let me get yöur jacket. FINGERS: No, no, no. I shall get that. LUCKY: It's fine. I got it. FINGERS: No, I got it. LUCKY: I said it's all right. (GRUNTS) LUCKY: Just good to see yöu. (WHISTLES) Hey, Precious! Come here. Say hi to the boss. (WHIMPERS) LUCKY: Say, boss, yöu look even better than yöu did when yöu went in. FINGERS: Hey, boss, yöu got a new suit? What is that? Is that linen? Is that silk? 'Cause yöu look good. Tell me it ain't Italian. LUCKY: What a sharp dude. Yeah. Hey... KING: I want yöuse to meet our new associate, Knuckles. He'll be the weapons and the safe expert. Knuckles, say hello to Fingers and Lucky. Hiya, mack. Welcome aboard. What's buzzin', cousin? (CRACKS KNUCKLES) All right. So, which of yöu geniuses found this place? I did. Ah, here we go. I did. And look at all this nutty stuff, boss. We even got a nut cart. - KING: Uh-huh. - Sorta. It'll do. We bought it for a song. And the place is the perfect cover. (CHUCKLES) And the view is swell. All right, let's get to it. Plans. Just like we talked about. Fat city. Here's the bank. Vault's right here. Reinforced steel. Solid as a rock. That's why we got these babies. (LAUGHS) We go in with a bang, and go out with the loot! Here. Kill the lights! Kill 'em! FINGERS: Ah, just probably rats. KING: Did yöu say rats? (MUFFLED GRUNTING) FINGERS: What's his problem? (SCREAMS) (BARKING) Shut her up, Fingers! I got this. (HIGH-FREQUENCY WHISTLE) (WHIMPERING) Wow. yöu can hear my dog whistle? (IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE) Can yöu hear this? Like, if I talk, like, high? Like this? yöu kiddin' me? Really? I'm not asking yöu if yöu can hear, I'm ask... (CHOKING) Knock it off! I got enough on my plate without yöu two horsin' around, yöu dig? Uh... Uh... Hey, boss, let's show yöu fellas the basement, huh? (LAUGHING) We barely have enough food for the next three days, let alone for the winter. Make that food last. It's all we can spare. Come on, Grayson. Five more. Let's go! Drop the purse, honey! It's time to dance! Okay! Yeah! Rope-a-dope! All right! Let's try cheek elasticity. Yeah! Show 'em what yöu got, Grayson! JIMMY: Come on, Grayson. Stretch those cheeks. Do yöu really think Grayson should be coming with me? I don't think he's recovered from that hit on the head. Raccoon thinks it would be good for morale during these hard times. After all, Grayson is the park hero. What a champ! Good luck, my dear. Find food for us. For the park. Our hopes go with yöu. Ole! We know yöu'll find food. Take me with yöu! JIMMY: (LAUGHS) And yöu should have great weather! 80% chance of sunshine! 0% chance of winter! Take me with yöu! Be careful! The city is full of germs and bright blinding lights. Oh, the sun's coming up. I must take refuge in the safety of darkness. Out of my way! Bye! Look at us! Off on a heroic quest! I couldn't think of a better way to celebrate our anniversary. Hey! We are not dating. This is an important mission to find food. Right? yöu're right. We're past those silly labels. Ours is a love... RAT: Well, Well, Well. (LAUGHS) Isn't this a tender little scene? I'll handle this. Hello, urban rodent thing! Is that mange or bubonic plague yöu're wearing? Anyway, my lady and I were hoping yöu could point out the... Hey! Put the... Hey! Give her back that backpack! Backpack! Give it pack! Pack! Back! (GRUNTING) Hey! (GROANS) ANDIE: Grayson! Ole! A-ha! (TRAM BELL RINGS) (GASPS) GRAYSON: Go on without me! Save the park! (YAWNS) (FARTS) Buddy, I ate too much cheese. (FARTING) I think I'm gonna have a cheese baby. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) (INDISTINCT CHATTER ON RADIO) Going down. Son of a gun. Lana... Gee, Lana, yöu look swell. Lana, crazy dame. Hey, ain't yöu got a nickel to call first? No need. yöur ma told me where to find yöu, King. Look at that! It's Lana! (BARKING) And who are yöu, yöu slobbery little monster? FINGERS: She's a vicious guard dog. (CHUCKLES) She's not very good at her job. LUCKY: She's not the only one. FINGERS: What's that supposed to mean? - LUCKY: Nothin'. - FINGERS: What do yöu mean, nothing? LUCKY: I said nothin'. LANA: I wouldn't have believed it, but yöu really have gone legit. Talk about second chances, it's boss. KING: Yeah, well, yöu keep it under yöur hat, though, 'cause, I mean, we ain't open yet, and we wanna have a surprise grand opening. Right, boys? (BARKING) Oh! Not again! (HIGH-FREQUENCY WHISTLE) (WHIMPERING) Hey! My Whistle! FINGERS: I wanna be reimbursed for that! (SNARLING) - Ahh! Oh! Rat! - FINGERS: Boss! - It's a rat! - FINGERS: Hang on! Get it off of me! Get this rat off of me! It's down my pants! Get it out of here! Get it off of me! Please! (BARKING) Next chance we get, we go back in there and stash away those nuts. Can't go back to the park, though. Ah, forget it. Let's go get that shiny thing. Here we go! No. And that's not... (GRUNTS) (LAUGHING) The thingamabooby is mine! (SURLY GROANS) Surly! - What are yöu doing here? - What are yöu doing here? - I'm looking for food. - I'm looking for food. - No! I'm looking for food! - No! I'm looking for food! Hey, did yöu find food? No. No food. Can I have that back, please? Why? What is this thing? It's just my musical instrument for playing the blues. I got no friends, no food This whistle has nothing to do with food Oh, I've got the no food blues For heaven's sakes! yöu found food, didn't yöu? And this thing has something to do with it. That's crazy! Spill the beans, or I... Whoa! Let's not get too nutty around here. Pardon the expression. Surly, I'm having a heck of a day! The park lost all its food, Grayson lost his mind, now I've lost Grayson. I've been out hungry and alone and getting real irritable! So, either yöu start talking, or come winter, I'll be wearing a new squirrel-skin coat. Capisce? The door. ANDIE: What? What door? SURLY: Nothing. Just that my door is always open to yöu, Andie. But we gotta go. Come back here! Hey! And hold on to that thing, okay? (PANTING) (WHISTLES) (LAUGHS) (WHIMPERS) Ooh! Ow! Tail! Head! Tail! Head! Tail! Yes! Yes! Yes! Buddy, we found it! The lost city of Nutlantis! (LAUGHING) FINGERS: I've been working on a bank heist All the live long day LUCKY: Stop with the singing, will yöu? Can yöu believe this? I can't believe this! Can yöu hear what I'm saying to yöu? (LAUGHING) FINGERS: And what's with that guy cracking his knuckles all the time? yöu know that's gonna lead to a serious arthritic condition. Thanks, chum. Sorry about that. Went a little nuts. I didn't say anything stupid, did I? (GRUNTING) FINGERS: Hey, how much is 20%? LUCKY: yöu kidding me? FINGERS: Is it a lot or is it a little? LUCKY: yöu're not serious, are yöu? Twenty of 100 is 20%. Ah, burying nuts for winter, huh? All right, listen up. We're gonna dig our own hole, a tunnel from here to the alley, loot the whole place, get fat for winter. Got it? 20%. Twenty of 100, that's what 20% is. yöu didn't go to school? (GROWLS) What's wrong with her? Probably complaining about the substandard working conditions here. LUCKY: All right, brainiac, let's move. FINGERS: yöu got an attitude. Here we go! (GROWLING) (PRECIOUS BARKING) Whoa! (YELLING) All right, Surly, yöu're gonna tell me what's going on in there. (PRECIOUS BARKING) Yes! Yes! Just give me that thing! There's food in there for the park, isn't there? And yöu're gonna share it, right? - Never! - Fine! All right! Share! I'll share! - Fifty-fifty. - Fifty-fifty? I've never gone 50-50 in my life. Fifty-fifty! Fifty-fifty! Deal! Ha-ha! (GASPS) - I got four words for ya. - Okay! Thing-a-ma-booby. - Ugh! - How do yöu like that, huh? - Okay, yöu win, yöu win! Get that thing out of my face! - Huh? Oh. yöu got me. So, yöu can talk. Okay, I'll stop talking, then. Just don't blow that whistle. SURLY: I'm not gonna feel sorry for yöu. - Of course, yes, I understand. - Stay. All right, it's safe to come down. I'm gonna level with yöu, 'cause yöu seem like a reasonable guy. If I don't get rid of yöu, they are gonna send me back to the pound, all right? And I can't go back to that pound. SURLY: Oh, yeah, sure. I believe yöu. No, I'm a victim of circumstance. Not my problem, dog. yöu guys okay? Don't worry about her. This is incredible! There's enough food here to feed the park for years! Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa. What're yöu doing? Look, can we be friends? - Oh, great. - Come on! I can do all sorts of stuff. yöu wanna see? yöu know what? I can fetch things. Huh? I can sit. Look at this thing! This is crazy! Whoo, whoo, whoo. Has a mind of its own. Oh, Oh, Oh! I can play dead! Watch. (GROANS) Now I'm alive. I mean, this is unbelievable. It's like one to the next. Dead, then alive. Right? I'm getting some of this food back to the park. - SURLY: What? - We had a deal. Well, I can attack her, if yöu want. I said, shut it. Look, the deal is, yöu take yöur share, I get mine, we split ways. There's no way I can get these to the park safely. We need a foolproof plan. Good luck with that. Buddy and I are digging a tunnel. (LAUGHS) That's just... That's crazy. No. It's brilliant! Oh, Raccoon and the animals will flip when they hear about this! We'll be back, first thing tomorrow, to get started on a tunnel. That's not part of the deal. Should I attack her now? What? No! yöu stay! I never said that I'd work with the park. Well, yöu're welcome to come back with me, if yöu want. Who knows, yöu might just end up being a hero. I'll be back with the team. Well done, Surly! Put a tail on her. yöu know what I mean. Hey, boss, I'm gonna lick yöur face. Come on, don't be weird. MOLE: I propose we assemble a team and take the nuts for the park! ALL: Yeah! See? See, everybody? What did I tell ya? The sunshiny days are here again. Okay. Okay, wait. Wait! But we have to work with Surly. That's right! We are working with... Are yöu nuts? I negotiated a deal with him. We split everything, 50-50. Negotiate? With Surly? Are yöu kidding me? He's the reason we don't have any nuts to begin with! ANDIE: No! No! (ALL PROTESTING) Hey, listen. For as long as this old mill has stood, we have always worked together and kept our promises. We are not a pack of wild animals! (BURPS) These two are animals. (CHUCKLING) Winter is coming. If we don't work with Surly, we won't survive. Did Grayson see this nut supply? No. Um... We got separated. Let's all wait until Grayson gets back... We don't know if Grayson's ever coming back. (ALL GASPING) ANIMAL 1: Grayson's not coming back? What? - No! - ANIMAL 2: Terrible. MOUSE: Wait. Who's gonna be handsome, then? RACCOON: I have come to a decision. The Bruisers, Mole and Andie will dig a tunnel to get the nuts out. Mole will lead. A-ha! I will? And while I don't trust Surly, we will work with him. For now. When all the nuts are secure, we will take what is ours. We do not honor deals with Surly. For the park! ALL: For the park! Yeah! Why aren't we doing this at night? All right, let's get to work! Stand back! Guys, the nut store is over there. Allow me. Ha! (GRUNTING) So, what do yöu think? Green wire? Hmm. Read my mind. Wait. We don't know what that... Andie, I am in charge. Proceed, my dear. (ELECTRICITY CRACKLING) (BRUISERS SCREAMING) No! Sis, wake up! Wake up, sis! Jamie! Wake up, sis! Come on... Disperse! I have been trained in mouth-to-mouth resuscitative measures. She's fine. (WHISTLES) (ALL GASPING) Grayson? I've been casing this place for days. Every hole, vent, trap and window is mapped in my head. yöu wanna break into this joint, survive the winter, yöu talk to me. KING: We cut the alarm wire from the tunnel. When yöu two hit the vault, we got three minutes to dynamite it and get that dough out. We dig here, from the alley into the basement. Why don't we just use the door thing? Too unpredictable. They lock it from the inside. Now, listen closely. We fill the vault with bags of nuts. We seal it, we head for state lines. It'll be days before the bank realizes they got peanuts on deposit. Agreed? Agreed. But I do not dig. 'Cause yöu're blind as a bat. What? Who said that? Where are yöu? What kinda haul are we talking, pops? We're talking almonds, pistachios, walnuts, Brazils... Enough cashews to buy yöurselves a racetrack. And did I mention the peanut brittle? That a candy or a nut? (LAUGHING) Both. (LAUGHS) Now, listen up. This is my last heist. I ain't going back to that rat-filled slammer, yöu dig? That's all we've been doing! JIMMY: Fire in the hole! (FARTS) (BRUISERS COUGHING) I'm gonna kill yöu! What's going on down... (SCREAMING) JAMIE: It's the same thing every time. We keep running into this hard brick-colored substance. Do yöu mean brick? We can't speculate on what is or isn't brick, but suffice to say, this material has a high number of brick-like properties. (FARTS) Okay, cut it out! Who is that? I guess there's no other choice. JIMMY: Hey, hey, wait a minute. JAMIE: We're not falling for it again! No, no, no, I'm serious. There's a loose brick over here. Yeah. Yeah. Definitely a loose brick. Hey, hey, Johnny. Johnny! Hey, I got a loose brick over here. Come here, come on, help me with this. Got it. Come on! Together, let's do this! Yeah! Come on, let's move it. - Yeah. Here we go. - Hey. Was this open the whole time? I don't know. I just got here. Come on, how about that face lick? Lick yöurself. Hey, what are those guys doin'? Digging for bones. Move it. - JIMMY: Come on, Johnny! - JOHNNY: Heave! Okay, we can do this. I think it's moving. JIMMY: Come on, heave. Heave. Yeah, yeah. That's it. That's it. yöu're doing great. Keep up the, uh... What do yöu call that? The teamwork. Yeah, good for yöu. She's moving. Make it last! Heave! Kick it! Heave! Heave! Here yöu go, guys! Here yöu... (GASPS) Where's Surly? Hey, guys. Look what I found. Isn't it great? - Come on. Come on. - No! Come get it! No! Let go! I cannot stop! - No, let go of the stick. - It's impossible! Let go of the stick! I do not know how to let go of the stick. Let go of this! All right, fine! Hey, Surly. (MUFFLED EXPLOSION) (BOTH SCREAMING) What'd yöu have for breakfast? (GASPS) yöu brought nuts! ALL: Hey, all right! Way to go, Surly! Way to go, Surly! I'm dead! (ALL SCREAMING) They'd have sent me back to that dog pound, Surly, I know it, I just know it! What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do? yöu gotta help me! I'll do whatever yöu say. (SOBBING) Whatever yöu say. (ALL COUGHING) Hey, what happened here? What happened? I want some answers! Say, fellas. Look! That squirrel was trying to blow up the nut store, and Precious stopped him! Can yöu believe it? Good pup! Good pup! What's wrong with yöu? Get that wall cemented up. From now on, I want that coal chute shut at all times, yöu hear me? Give the mutt a treat. Now cement that wall up! That dog is one smart dog. She's smarter than yöu. She's smarter than yöu! She's smarter than me? No one's smarter than me. No one's smarter than yöu. That's right! Right! I'm glad we're in agreement, for once. LUCKY: Of course. (CRASHING) Surly? Hey, what's going on? This trashcan has a hole in it. We use it as cover to dig a new hole into the human hole. No brick. Now that's groundhog thinking, right there. Okay, well, how long will it take? Day or two. Depending on any pipes or rocks we come across. It'll be three days. It'll be two days! - Three! - yöu wanna take this to the ground? Ridiculous! It'll never work! yöu'll need Raccoon's approval. yöu kiddin' me? Raccoon's gonna love this idea! Yeah. Raccoon. Guy's not even here and he's still ruining my life. I gotta tell ya, the nerve of those bums! The nerve of those bums! "Raccoon would approve of this!" Oh, really? Raccoon! That guy, he's a bigger thief than I am! But those blockheads can't see it. They're blind as Mole. I'm the brains of this outfit. I'm the guy with the... The brains. Did I already say that? Raccoon's nothing but a lying old sack of fur! What? (COOING) Hey, Surly, over here. (CLEARS THROAT) What... What are yöu doing here? Aren't yöu supposed to be working on that tunnel? Raccoon's orders. There's something yöu need to know. I haven't been completely honest. Yeah. Right. (SIGHS) Raccoon's planning to double-cross yöu. We were all in on it. I'm sorry, but just seeing how... Raccoon's always had it out for me. And besides, who says I'm helping? But yöu are helping us, aren't yöu? I'm helping myself. Right. My mistake. Just remember, Surly, that park needs those nuts. Do what yöu will. I didn't authorize any handouts, did I? yöu know Andie. it was her idea. Are yöu looking for these? (GASPS) I know Andie. She lacks obedience. Can't follow orders. But she follows Surly. yöu know, he even tamed that guard dog? He could actually pull this off. (SCREAMS) The day Surly saves this park is the day nuts will rain from the skies! Hmm. There could be an accident. (SCREAMING) Have yöu considered sabotage? What? Hey, what's gotten into yöu? It's only Surly, a two-bit trash can thief. It's not about thievery. It's about that food getting to those animals. Have yöu forgotten my motto? "Animals are controlled by the amount of food they have." - "It is our duty... - "It's our duty... - "...to keep it from them." - "...to keep it from them." Good. Now, where were we? Ah, yes. Sabotage. Yeah, sabotage. Um... What is that, French? (CLATTERING) (GRUNTING) What are yöu up to, Mole? (BOTH SCREAMING) Grayson? Surly? Ha! - Hey. Hey. - Surly! Surly! - Hands off. What's wrong with yöu? - Thank goodness! Everything's wrong with me! I've been out there with the people, and the cars, and the cats, and... Rat! It's a rat! Hold me! No, I'll hold yöu! Whack job! What're yöu doing? yöu're drowning me in... Drown. Buddy, watch him. And keep him away from sharp objects. Okay, how about this one? (BURPS) (BOTH LAUGHING) Mole, what are yöu doing? (SCREAMS) Wait, wait. Is that water? - Let's get out of here! - Whoa! (GRUNTING) (BOTH SCREAMING) (CHIRPING) I'm gettin' me a pettin' zoo. What are yöu gettin'? - A new partner. - That's it! Hey, can it! yöu hear somethin'? No. (SCREAMS) (BOTH COUGHING) (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING) (MUFFLED SCREAMS) (PHONE RINGING) SURLY: Dog! Dog! Open up! Dog, dog, open up! Dog, get out here! This bird's gonna kill me! KING: Yeah? Lana... SURLY: Come on, come on, come on! Do it now! Do it now! Hurry up! Honey, not now, no. I can't talk right now 'cause we're... LANA: Come on! All the guys are asking! Potty break? Now? No, no, no. Not yöu, honey. No, no. Look, sweetie... (CARDINAL TWITTERING) (PRECIOUS GROANS) What was that? Ma, is that yöu? Get to the alley and stop the water! Stop the water. Got it. Hey, yöu're not the boss of me! Apparently, yöu are. I love yöu. First stop water, then lick face. Surly, what are yöu doing? Shoot that rodent! Shoot it! (GROWLING) (BOTH COUGHING) Quick! Where's the shut-off valve? FINGERS: I smell a rat, boss! Rats did this? Find the rat. FINGERS: I'm confused as to what kind of rats we're talking about here, boss. It's him! There he is, the rat! Are they okay? Huh? They're gonna be fine. Hey, don't tell the other dogs we're friends, all right? It wouldn't look good. Ooh! That guy needs glasses! - Dog! - Got it! Hey! (GRAYSON SCREAMING) Surly! yöu left me! Wait, man, don't leave me alone! There is a crazed rat up there! - Hey, wait! Hey! - Grayson? (SCREAMS) Is that yöu? (LAUGHS) Shut the front door! What are yöu two doing here? (SCREAMS) (BARKING) (GRUNTING) PRECIOUS: Face lick! SURLY: That's not his face. (SCREAMS) So, yöu're the mole, double entendre intended! Nah, I'm a chicken. I saw yöu sabotage our tunnel. Was it Raccoon? Talk! Hey, yöu want me to hurt him? Keep a lookout. (SIGHS) Yeah, boss. Do yöur worst. Go on! I am a sealed vault, resistant to questioning. A tough nut to crack. A concrete pillar. A jar with a... (SCREAMING) My retinas! Raccoon's trying to stop the heist! I'm not buying it. (SCREAMING) Less food means more control! If the heist succeeds, Raccoon will lose control of the park! But so what? yöu don't care about the park, do yöu? I don't. But when I tell the team, I'll get double. yöu think they'll believe a criminal like yöu? After what I did for them? Oh, they'll listen. Yeah, don't kid yöurself. (SNARLS) (SCREAMS) JIMMY: Oh, man! There was water all over the place! Johnny was choking, I was choking, and then the next thing yöu know, there's Grayson! He saved my butt! He saved my butt! - It was my butt. - Oh, yeah? Stop talking about butts. Talk about me. I'll kick both yöur butts! Come here! Come here! Grayson, I'm so glad yöu're... JAMIE: Great to have yöu back, Grayson! JOHNNY: It's been a disaster. We had to work with Surly. Surly? (LAUGHING) Surly! They think I shaved their butts. JAMIE: Surly! Careful! They come hither! What happened? yöu were up here. yöu ready for this piece of news? It was Mole. Saw him try to drown the twins. He confessed to everything. Mole? It was all Raccoon's idea. So, yöu're blaming Raccoon because he kicked yöu out of the park. No, I'm not. Raccoon has never harmed us before. But he sure has! Hey, listen. I just wanna get my cut and split, all right? - Grayson... - GRAYSON: Yes! yöu were there. I was! Wait... Where? yöu think it was me, don't yöu? No! No one said that. Just explain yöurself. Buddy, did yöu see anything? Wait, yöu're asking him? He can't help yöu. yöu're wasting yöur time! He's useless! Can't speak! Only knows how to take orders! Kinda like yöu, Andie. Is that how yöu treat the only animal who defends yöu? - No. No. - yöu lousy... Just let him go. That tunnel is open now. We get our share out before morning. Let him take his. JIMMY: We can't trust him! We let him go. Honor the deal. Bye, Surly! Come back soon! I mean, stay away! I dislike yöu strongly! Hey, Surl, are we gonna get the team together? Huh? Do another heist? No. Now's a bad time. Oh. Oh, yeah. I get it. Okay, not now. So how about now, huh? I said no. Job's done. Team's done. yöu need a lookout? Huh? Huh? Now, get back to yöur humans. I'm on my own now. We're playing that game again! All right. No. No! Get out of here! Scat! Hey, look what yöu made me do. Whoa! Whoa! (YELPING) PRECIOUS: No! Surly! Watch out, it's a... (GASPS) (SNICKERS) FINGERS: What are we gonna do with him, boss? Shut it and grab me that blowtorch. (PRECIOUS BARKING) (GASPS) Lana... Yeah, right. Good seeing yöu. Nice seeing yöu, Lana. We gotta go do, uh, tunnel stuff. So now yöu know. When were yöu gonna tell me, King? I already told yöu before. yöu can't change who yöu are. LUCKY: Boss, come here! Well, go on. Rob yöur bank, already! This really is my last job. Boss! Come on! LUCKY: Hey, hey! (MEN LAUGHING) This is it. A goldmine right over our heads! Let's blow this thing. What about Lana? (PRECIOUS WHINES) But I don't have the whistle. I know. RAT: Hold him down! Hold him down! That's it. (CHUCKLES) RACCOON: Well, what do we have here? A hero or a thief? yöu think yöu can starve the park to stay in control? Mole told me everything. What? What's he talking about? I didn't say anything! He's loopy! Yeah. Cuckoo, yöu know, nuts. Whoo-hoo! Is this another one of yöur swindles? Some half-baked revenge against me? (GRUNTS) RACCOON: It's something else, isn't it? yöu're trying to impress. Grayson, perhaps. Andie? RACCOON: Oh, I see. No matter. My accomplices will take care of them soon enough. They don't follow me. They hate me. They hate me! Maybe, but I can't leave any evidence, Surly. Every good thief knows that. Hey, this is getting a little crazy, don't yöu think? I mean... Maybe we'll finish yöu off next! And where's that shiny thing he's supposed to have? KING: All right, this is it. Ten, nine... yöu'll get the rest once yöu dispose of Andie and Grayson. I'll finish off Mr. Hero myself. The park'll get rid of yöu. They'll vote in new leaders. How many leaders do yöu think this park can have? Three, two... One! (ANIMALS COUGHING) He'll warn the others! What are yöu waiting for? After him! Bingo, boys. (LAUGHING) Hey, hey! Hey, look at all this moolah! Load the dough into the trucks. And let's get out of here. yöu two, stick the nuts in the vault and seal it up. What are yöu gonna do with yöur money, huh? FINGERS: Pettin' zoo! I'm gonna buy me three pettin' zoos, and give yöu two of 'em! And ponies! Don't forget the ponies! Pretty little ponies! They're so soft and cuddly. One more! What the... I told yöu to load those nuts into the vault. Yeah, so why did yöu take the cart out of the tunnel? What kind of game are yöu playing here? What kind of game are yöu playing? Relax, we probably just bumped the cart. Or maybe it was rats! Holy Toledo! LUCKY: Watch out. KING: I'll handle these rats. (GUN FIRING) - Squirrels! - Watch out! - Hang on, Fingers! - Hey! (RAT SQUEALING) - KING: Get going. - Okay. LUCKY: What about yöu? What, are yöu deaf? I said, get going! FINGERS: It was going so smooth! (BOTH GASP) Grayson, yöu moron! Surly, I need a disguise! Something flamboyant! What? Get yöur head out of yöur tail! Lead the team into the tunnel and escape through our hole. I'll distract the big guy. I'll need some skates, a mustache and maybe a cape. yöu don't need a cape. I can't help the park alone. I'm not a hero, but yöu are. Last summer, during that heat wave, who discovered that broken sprinkler so everyone could have water? I did? That's right! They believe in heroes. So snap out of it and be one. It's hero time. It's hero time! Why am I shouting? Rats! Rats! Run! Run for yöur lives! Children and Grayson first! Run! It's Grayson! - He's come to save us! - Run! Get out of my way! Run! Now is our chance. Let's go! Move it, everybody! Move! Move! (YELLING) (GASPS) (SCREAMING) Mole? What are yöu doing here? Andie, thank goodness yöu're here. Raccoon? Surly is planning to double-cross us all. He confessed everything. What? He said it's yöu and Mole who tried to drown The Bruisers. But he's working for Surly. (STAMMERING) What? (BOTH SCREAMING) Would yöu stop doing that? Jimmy, Johnny, get to the park and bring more animals to help. - Yes, sir. - Yes, sir. - Out of the way. Out of the way. - Me first. Rest of us will unload the nuts from that van there. For the park! Come on, guys! I know what I'm going to spend some of my money on. Whoa! Look at that, Buddy! Celebrate later. This van could move at any time. JAMIE: Start unloading. Raccoon, I'm sorry I doubted yöu. ALL: Raccoon! Open this door! Raccoon! Open the door! ANDIE: Raccoon! Open this door right now! JAMIE: Open it! Open the door! (BLOWS RASPBERRY) Let him go. It won't change the plan. GRAYSON: Ole! Ole! Ole! (GRAYSON LAUGHING) Amazing! But that will. Whee! GRAYSON: I am enjoying myself! (SCREAMS) Bank to the left! Higher! GRAYSON: Ole! Ole! Ole! We gotta get everybody out of this van. Find a way in. Follow me! This... (LAUGHS EVILLY) Oh, boy! (BOTH LAUGHING) - Hey, we did it, Fingers. - Yeah! Easy street! I gotta take a look. Ooh, yeah! What? Nothing but nuts. - We've been had! - What? No money! Those dirty rats! Hey, hey, Squirrel! That's right, a squirrel! It's that squirrel! And a bird? Looks like they're on to us. Time to end this little charade. (TIRES SCREECHING) Turn around! I can't see! Go after 'em! (GRUNTING) (GROANING) (SQUAWKING) (CARDINAL SQUEAKS) (CATS MEOWING) (GASPING) ANDIE: We can do this. Whoa! (ALL GROAN) ANDIE: Come on, try again. We need Grayson. (SCREAMING) Grayson, are yöu there? Not to worry, I'm perfectly safe. (SCREAMS) (SCREAMING) Help! Oh! Thank yöu! Thank yöu! Mole, quit clowning around and help us open this door. Give me a boost, Grayson. Ole! Grayson! He's here to save us! Oh. - Let me explain! - Let's get him, guys! Hey, wait a second. Forget him. The door's open. We can push the nuts out. A-ha! - What... - Raccoon! yöu can't... Let go, yöu idiot! RACCOON: Help me throw him off before he kills us all! Kill us? This squirrel is a hero! Well, co-hero, actually. Raccoon is the double-crosser! yöu have to believe me! Hang on, Mole! What does it look like I'm doing? (SCREAMING) Why did yöu lock us in here? yöu're wasting time! This is our one opportunity to rid the park of this villain. For the park! yöu still haven't answered the question. This is treason. Andie! Answer the question, Raccoon. Was Surly telling the truth? Answer! GRAYSON: I call for a vote! Agreed! All those in favor of banishment, raise yöur paws! (GROWLS) ANDIE: Raccoon! Shiny! Hey! (LAUGHING EVILLY) (SIRENS WAILING) State lines are just past this dam. Then we are home free. (THUMP) yöu're the thief. Not Surly. He was right about yöu. (GUN COCKING) Hey, hey! No, no, no, there's dynamite back there. Huh? (TIRES SCREECHING) Hmm. OFFICER ON MEGAPHONE: All right, boys, we've got yöu completely surrounded. Come out with yöur hands up! Out! Now! I saw this coming. No, yöu didn't. (GASPING) Mole, where is everybody? Still inside. But Andie's in the other van with Raccoon. yöu can't stop him alone. Surly, what's happened to yöu? FINGERS: All I wanted was a pettin' zoo. yöu'll never get away with this. (SOBBING) I want my mommy. They've got hostages. Stand down. (FINGERS CRYING) ALL: Whoa! Holy Toledo! Whoa! I bet it was that squirrel! Enough with the squirrels! Andie. Andie. (GASPS) Surly? (GASPS) Oh! (BOTH SCREAMING) (BOTH GASPING) Whoa! (COUGHS) Andie? Andie? (THUDDING) KING: We can still save the cash. Hey, where yöu going? What are yöu doing? There's more money. Ha-ha. What are yöu trying to prove, Surly? Raccoon, it's not stable. Why are yöu doing this? Tell me. (GRUNTS) (LAUGHS) Buddy! Atta boy, pal! (HIGH-FREQUENCY WHISTLE) (GROANS) The shiny! Give it to me! (SCREAMING) Not so fast, thief! No! Look, Surly and Raccoon! They'll go over the falls. Everyone, come on. (SCREAMING) ANDIE: I got yöu. JAMIE: Don't let go. MOLE: Hold on! JAMIE: yöu can do it. ANDIE: Raccoon, climb up! GRAYSON: Let go! No, don't let go! We can save both of yöu! Hurry! Never! yöu backstabbing vermin! Surly goes down with me! Buddy, that was some score. We almost pulled it off, didn't we? Surly, don't yöu dare let go. I'm sorry, Andie! - What? - No! Surly, no! (SCREAMS) Is it? (GASPS) Look! - It's Grayson! - ANIMALS: Grayson! Thank yöu. Thank yöu. No autographs, please. yöu can admire the tail, but no touching. ANIMALS: Grayson! Yeah! GRAYSON: Thank yöu! The wheel! Jump! Thank yöu! Thank yöu. yöu're welcome. yöu're welcome. Grayson! What's going on here? (SCREAMS) (SCREAMING) (GROANS) Ha! Never fear! JIMMY: Grayson! yöu two guys are here, too? Hi! Ha-ha! Come on, guys! ANIMALS: Let's go! (GASPS) (BOTH SCREAMING) Rats! It's a rat! It's a rat... (SOBBING) Take me away, Officers. Take me away. Just save me from the rats. Percy "King" Dimpleweed, yöu and I are officially through. Come on, let's go. (SOBBING) Hey, Precious, where yöu going, girl? Precious? PRECIOUS: Psst! Buddy. Come with me. Best... Friend. (HOWLING) (HOWLING CONTINUES) (SURLY COUGHS) What are yöu looking at? Wait, Buddy. Did yöu just speak? Okay, okay, okay, enough, enough, enough. I get it, yöu like me, I get it. LANA: Precious! Precious! Okay, Surly, so, see yöu at the nut store. Wait, what? That place? Yeah, Lana's the new owner. Hey, no more whistles, huh? Just face licks. Oh, hi, Andie. Surly! When yöu went over those falls, I thought I'd never see yöu again. Oh! We got to go. Come on. Okay, calm down. Where are we going? yöu risked yöur life to save this park. Everyone has to know. No. The team saved the park. GRAYSON: Okay, stop touching the tail. Stop touching. Stop. Stop touching the tail! (SIGHS) So then what are yöu going to do? I'm gonna keep finding food for this park. But from now on, we do it together. Deal? This park will always honor yöur deals, Surly. SURLY: Yeah, they say life's there for the taking, but the truth is, life's really there for the sharing. Huh. Once yöu realize that, yöu might discover there's a little hero in all of us. After all, we're all a little nuts. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) (KOREAN POP SONG PLAYING) (SINGING) "Hope You've Liked & Enjoyed The Movie" (BARKS) Any more big ideas? (CHIRPS) Please stay.
