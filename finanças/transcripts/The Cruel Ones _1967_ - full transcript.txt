Sure hurts me to think of all that money winding up in an oven same as kindling. Simple. Government wants new notes, gotta burn up the old ones. I don't care how old they are, I'd take 'em. What serial number you at? I've checked over $1,350,000 so far. $200,000 to go. Squad halt! Lieutenant! Sergeant! Find out who they are. Right. Looks all right to me. It is now. Care for a sip of hard stuff? Sorry, I got no cup for the lady. Much obliged, but she don't drink. Wish I could say the same about my missus. Not my missus either. That's her husband... or was. Captain ambrose Allen. Killed in the battle of Nashville. That was months ago. Buried on military grounds. She got a permit to dig him up, - try and fix him some. - What for? To take him to her ranch. Hired my rig to do the carting. Well, that's all over now. New Mexico's a long way off and you got a lot of miles to cover. Godspeed, ma'am. Everything in order, sir. Right. That's them all right. 30-man escort. He-yah! Squad, close order, forward, ho! Ho! You quit that boozin'! We've got a job ahead of us! O lord, crown what we do with thy blessing, for it is thy will we undertake. - Amen. - Amen, pa. Nat. Oh sure, pa. Amen. Ll ook at this! A fresh start, boys. A fresh start. Hey-ahh! - Whoa, whoa! - Jonasl! It worked! It worked just like you said, Jonas. You've been drinking. Ben, lend a hand. Bixby and Tyler. We killed 'em, Ben. They died for the cause. Don't fret, son, we're no kin. Only joined us for the money. All right, boys, put the corpse in the coffin. Silky, that's how they feel, silky. Like those fine dresses I'm gonna buy me, and maybe some pearls to go with 'em. And a diamond brooch. You're in for a jolt if you think pa went through all this just to doll you up. Plans can change, Sonny. And kitty's got plenty of practice in how to change 'em. Mm-hm! You look younger in uniform, sweetheart. You smell better sober, lady. Can I help count the money, please? Only thing I'm counting: Miles between here and home and a new beginning. If they think the war is over because Lee surrendered, they weren't counting on me or any of us hellbenders. Jonas, look at this. Nat, you lost something. I want absolutely no traces to link us here, you understand? Take Bixby and Tyler and dump them downstream and get this through your heads: Any mistake, anything at all, could be fatal. I'll show none of you any mercy. We're starting on a hard trip. We'll be hunted like animals but we'll make it. You understand? We'll make it. May the good lord protect us. Amen. Whoa! Be alert, boys. Get that veil down, you! Search them. Where do you hail from? Whaddya mean "search them," lieutenant? You heard my question. Where do you hail from? Nashville. Lieutenant! Over here. Nashville cemetery. My daughter's husband died fighting, lieutenant. Against the north. Now he's going home. Your permit, please, to transport the, uh... To transport your... Your permit, madam. - Madam? - Yeah, sure, the permit. I have it. Federal commander gave me one. That's the honest truth. Yes, ma'am. The permit. Oh yes. The permit. Okay. Oh, I... oh dear. I'm sure I put it here. There's so much stuff in my bag, I... I'll find it. It can't be lost, I'll find it. Just a moment. I can't remember where I... Had it in my purse. I know it's somewhere! The hat! Ambrose's hat! The hat, yes. Because it's all you left me of him, all I have to hold on to, I putitin here. Is that so silly? You needn't explain, Mrs. Allen. I humbly beg your pardon, but I had to make sure. You'd be wise to travel on better-frequented roads in the future, colonel. Why? A gang of killers. They attacked a convoy back at the river. Massacred every living soul, man and beast alike. But they won't get far. There are more than 1,000 of our men searching the territory. Good. Forward! Idiots! Oh, Jonas, it was wonderful! It worked like a charm! Almost caught because you forgot. All the brains you've got is precious little, but I mean to have 'em sharp and clear or get rid of 'em entirely! Try boozing, again, kitty, it'll be your last drink. What's the use of having a woman around when we gotta do the cooking ourselves? She didn't join us as a servant. That'd be the wrong word, all right. Pa brought her along because he needs... We all know what pa needs, but I tell you, I sure don't think he's so damned smart. Gosh, Ben, Jeff's thinking again. He gives her hell one minute, then strokes her and pets her the next. Makes me sick. Pa needs a widow for that coffin. He don't hit her unless he's got a reason. They'd respect me if I was your wife. Yeah, mm-hm. I'm in love with you, Jonas. That's what you told me before, and I told you I was in love with the cause. If I did marry again, it would be to a lady. Just trying to be honest with you, kitty. I'm not good enough for you, is that it? Now, easy, easy. Think of all I've got ahead. Reorganize the confederate army, attack the union, win back the south. Form a new government. Man who could do that could create a lady. One, mind you, who don't booze and don't cuss and don't... Jonas... Be patient with me, please, Jonas. Wipe your face, you look ridiculous. - All clear up ahead, pa. - Good. Not much further. How's the team, son? They'll hold up, pa. Doing fine. What's funny? Your pa cares more about these precious horses than he does about us. Here. Lemme drive. Yah, yah! Yah, yah, yah! Giddyup! Yah! Yah! Yah! Whoa! Whoa! I can't stop 'em! Get after that coach! Hurry, boys! Help! Ben! Ben! Help! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, whoa! The horses just went wild. Never went wild on you before. I gave kitty the reins, I'm sorry. Sorry? That all you got to say? Help with the box. Gotta make denton before sunset. Lady? You're nothing but trouble. And you make me sick! If it wasn't for the money in that coffin, I wouldn't have you near me for two seconds. Get the horses! Get the horses! - Yah, yah, yah! - Kitty! Stop! Let me... go! They call you crazy... Jeff! She was running away, pa. With the money! Get up. What's wrong, pa? She was escaping, I tell you. If it hadn't been for me, we'd be back where we... Where we started, without nothin'! She was just a trollop, pa! I needed that trollop more than I need you. The certificate is made out to Mrs. Ambrose Allen. Who's gonna play widow now? Me, Ben, or Jeff? None of you. We'll find another widow. Take her away and bury her. Deep. Bring back her clothes. Nat, we'll camp here, take care of the rig. Ben. Go into denton. Try to find a durable, respectable female. This time, ohne who doesn't booze. What's bothering you, son? What happened to kitty. I'm not bringing another woman back so the same thing can happen to her. So it ends here, is that what you want? The finish of everything we fought for, planned for? Loyal stragglers waiting for us to show up at the ranch as we promised them. This is a big thing we're doing, son. But before we make another step, we must find our widow. I may not show it, Ben, but I love you just like the others, though your mother wasn't theirs. To me, maybe you're the best of the lot. Okay, Claire. We'll double it. As you wish, slim. Give me a match, sweetheart. Think you're getting a big head, Claire. Winning all that money. - How many cards? - No cards. Gimme one. There you are, Tequila. Another hundred. I pass. All right, I'm in. Straight. There you are. You oughta quit, slim. You'll be broke soon. Gimme a drink, Sam, on credit. Claire stripped me clean again. If you need money, here's a way of earning it. Look, they really mean it. $10,000, they're crazy. Does she always win? Straight. Sorry, slim. Full house. The game's over. Looks like you're plum out of money. Says who? - The game continues. - Whatever you like. But I want a change of decks. - All right. - Sam! Bring us a new pack of cards. One good hand and you're out. Okay if I play? Can you lose? Half of what I win. A smart guy. Deal with your hands, not with your mouth, will ya? Let's play. Twenty. Twenty. One card. One for me too. That mirror over there. Sure it's hanging in the right position? That trick would be too easy. You opened this hand, it's up to you. All the rest. Pass. How many cards did you take? One. Just one? All right, Claire, poker. Royal flush. This time, I got ya. This card was mine! What are you talking about? I'm gonna turn you in to the law! You're right, mister, but this is not the way to act with a lady. Maybe she is a cheat, but she's still a woman, and a mighty pretty one at that. I lost my whole paycheck to that one a while ago and I want every cent of it back! Come on, honey, you're coming with me. What are you doing? Take your hands off me! Don't worry. I got a job for you. We're miners. Look out. Let's get 'em! Let's talk this over. Don't move, if you wanna stay alive. Whaddya say to my offer? You tend to my brothers and me. Two thousand bucks for a month's work. Two thousand dollars? Are you crazy? Maybe. Make up your mind. All right. Over there. Come on, never mind them! Put out that fire, put it out, I tell ya! Nat! Jeff! It's me! Well done, son. Hey, you did yourself right proud there, Ben. Ah, not bad, either! We're gonna enjoy this one. - She's a looker, Ben. - What is this? Take your hands off me! I get it now. Well, Ben, I'll bet you're proud. Slicker to slicker. The fact is, you set me up. You were the one playing switching with the cards. And it was you who got slim to start the fight so you could get away with it. Well? Wasn't it? All right. What's her name, son? I don't know. Mrs. Allen? Claire. In your role with us, you will henceforth be known as Mrs. Ambrose Allen. What are you talking about? Is this some traveling medicine show? Here's your new wardrobe. Mourning outfit. Mourning? - For whom? - Your man's dead, widow Allen. Died a hero in Nashville. We're taking him back to bury him on your ranch. Miners. None of you are miners. Who are you? Now, wait a minute. What's really in that coffin? Let's see the fit. You're the convoy killers, aren't you? You robbed them and murdered the lot. We're confederate soldiers, honey. On a mission. Be smart, daughter. Do as you're told and you won't be harmed. You scum. It was all lies, every word. The $2,000 I told you is true. Tell her, pa. Figure's correct. Two thousand dollars is a lot of money for just crying over a dead man. Don't you worry. We'll get our money's worth. Hold it! Nobody touches her. Is that clear? Nobody. Well, Mrs. Allen, don't you think you'd better get dressed? All right, boys, break camp. That black outfit looks even better on her than it did on kitty. Can't wait to get your hands on her, can you? Claire. It's not like you think. Pa's reorganizing the confederate army. He'll never give in to the Yankees. Do you know how many died in that convoy? Civilians, pa. It's gonna be tougher this time. Don't worry. If they catch us, I'll tell them the truth. What truth? That we forced you to join us. Get down, all of you. And you too, ma'am. May I inquire just what it is you're looking for? Mass murderers and what they stole. Not the ruffians we heard about in denton? The ones who destroyed the army convoy? They're somewhere around. Found more of their handiwork in denton's rocky hills. A woman's body, stripped clean. You suspect us? Suspect everyone. Nothing, sheriff. Sure you searched everything? Everything. 'Cept this coffin. Go ahead. Sheriff... We have a permit. Open it. Please. Let me do it. Never mind, let it be. Forgive me, ma'am. It suddenly came to me how my widow would feel if I was in there. We'll never forget your kindness, sir. Come, daughter. Boys? You can make the fort at Santa fe before nightfall if you ride hard. I think we'll just camp here for the night. Suit yourself, colonel, but don't take chances. That gang is ruthless. We'll keep our eyes open, sheriff. You did well, daughter. Better than the one you killed? Lord, yes. And I've got her clothes on. You are all rotten! You stink of death like this dress! Claire! Hold it, son. Best to let her get it out of her system. Come on. Let's help captain ambrose back in the coach. Get out. Go away. I like the company. Don't touch me. That act you got don't kid me. You ain't that pure. Help! Ben! Help! Help! Ben! Jeff! Take your hands off her! Keep out, Ben! Or I'll kill her. Make him stop! Make him stop, Jonas! Jonas, make him stop! Enough, Jeff. That's enough. Let it be, Jeff. Let it be! Get back to the wagon. Ben! You're bleeding. Excuse me. That's not a joke. No, I... no, I mean it. I'm sorry, it's my fault you're here. Don't talk about it now. I'll make it up to you. I promise. Ben, forget it. Just forget it. We're even. Now, whoal hey, hey! Get it up here, get it up here! Whoa, whoa! The braces are broken. We've gotta stop. Hey, look what I found. Seems like somebody stopped here before us. Military fellows. Two or three days old, I'd say. Two. Dated day before yesterday. They gave us the front page, pa. They're hunting for us in these parts, too. Best avoid little elm. For god's sake, we're almost there. Little elm, los pecos, and then home. Too risky. We can't avoid these posses forever. Now. Here's the route we've been following. But there's another way home, straight across the hondo. We're about 30 miles from sundog. Right after the town, we continue north for two days to the river. Cross the hondo, we're practically on our doorstep. If the horses hold out. They will, plenty of water. Injun country, eh? Friendly Indians, no yanks. I dunno. We'll find yanks aplenty in the town, though. Can't we avoid sundog, pa? Need provisions for the last lap. Do you think we'll make that last lap of his? I've gotta see this through to the end, for his sake. Are you anxious to get home like them, Ben? Home? That home was never mine. From the time I was born, I've been a stranger there. Hoping for a change. But it got worse instead of better. I thought the war would have united us. Make me a part of the family. Guess I thought wrong. No, honey, I got no home. "Cept where you are? Whoa. Must be Sunday, stores are shut. Saloon's open. We can get supplies there. - Good day. - Reverend? Passing through? That's right. My daughter's husband fell at the battle of Nashville. We're taking him home. A noble errand. Please accept my most Sincere condolences, Mrs., uh... Allen. Mrs. Ambrose Allen. The wife of captain ambrose Allen? That's right, but... Unbelievable. I knew Allen very well, when he was commander at fort Brent. Why, the Garrison is only 20 miles from town. Why, he used to come to sundog quite often. - Then you know his wife. - No, only the captain. He'd just been appointed at the time. We heard later that he married you, ma'am. I think it fit and proper for me to hold a... Service in his honor. Please, don't trouble yourself, reverend. We must be on our way, we thank you very much. There can be no haste before the eternity of death. I consider it a privilege. That way, you could also see sergeant tolt. Tolt? He was captain Allen's aide, on pension now. Lives right here in town. Surely you remember him, Mrs. Allen. Tolt often speaks of you. Of course I remember him. Eddie, run down to merriweather street and fetch sergeant tolt. I'm sure he's there right now. Help bring captain Allen to church, please. Nat, go to the saloon and get those supplies. Come. Then this Allen, he really existed. Yeah. But that permit's a forgery. Dead man's not, we got his name off a cross in Nashville cemetery. I feel like busting right out and laughing my head off. That wouldn't be very fitting for the part you're playing in this little drama, daughter. And it is written that the ways to our lord are many and multiple. But there can be no doubt that one of them today led to our town. For it cannot be simple coincidence, this arrival of our beloved friend. No, it is the will of the lord. Captain ambrose Allen, on his way to eternal repose, has come to us passing by, as it were, for a last farewell. Come on in, tolt. Fate has brought your captain back to us for a brief moment, as well as his wife. Miss Ruth. Where is miss Ruth? Ruth, the sergeant. Right over here, tolt. Here she is. Mrs. Allen. Mrs. Allen, the lord be blessed for leading you here. Don't cry, tolt. Don't cry. Forgive me, Mrs. Ruth. It's just that I'm so happy you're here with my captain. Let us kneel and sing the requiem together. I'll take the coach, Ben. Reverend. Come, Ruth, better be going. Not yet, please, miss Ruth, you can't leave now. I'm sorry, sergeant. We're behind schedule already. Come to my house, I'll show you the photographs I took of you with my captain. I've saved them all, even the ones of the fair in Santa fe. Photographs. Too many memories, tolt. Too many memories. Goodbye. - Goodbye, miss Ruth. - God bless you, child. Wait till you see those photographs, reverend. I'm really proud of them. Whoa. Pa? Why stop? We've only done about three miles. Forgot to buy paraffin oil. Ride back to sundog, nat. Okay, pa. Alone? Alone. Eddie? Is it you, Eddie? Here are the photos to take to the reverend. Eddie? Why don't you answer? I've divided the food, pa. Why should we lose each other? Don't know the hondo. Best to each carry his own grub. Think the horses'll make it? Can't buy some from the Indians. What sort of Indians would settle down by a nasty old river like that? Tough old Indians. Moved in here when they got tired of war paint. Ready? Now we are. Where's the paraffin oil? Oh, I couldn't find any. Found this instead. Take a gander at captain ambrose Allen. Handsome feller. There's his wife. Not bad either. Want to see what your husband looked like, honey? Where did you get that? Oh, he didn't give me any trouble. It'll take 'em months to find his body. You coward. Coward! He was blind! I'll kill you, I'll kill you! Get her offa Mel leave her alone. Take it easy, come on now. Claire! Nat! I'll take care of her. Mexican outlaws. Stay down. Pa, look. Hombre! Hey, hombre! We don't like to kill you! What do you want? All your stuff. The cash, the food, you know. Then we let you go. They'll strip us and kill us just the same. Get out of here. Pa, they're going to the wagon! Hold your fire, stop. That coffin will scare them bandits. Muerte. Hey, look! Hey. First we're attacked by bandits, then we're saved by the damn Yankees. Lieutenant soublette of the Garrison at fort Brent at your service, sir. Any losses? Only three horses. Allow me to thank you. What are you doing in these parts? I'm patrolling the zone. I'm afraid I'll have to ask you the same thing, sir. We're here on a very sad mission. Daughter, permit? I got it, pa. There you are, lieutenant. General ober's headquarters. This must have been quite an experience for you, Mrs. Allen. You can recover at fort Brent. We'll be glad to escort you. Thank you, lieutenant, we'll be on our way. No, wait. I accept the lieutenant's kind hospitality. I'm very tired. Furthermore, I would like to see the fort once commanded by my husband. Hombre! I recognize you. Great man of honor. Shoot at me when I hold a white flag. I'm only sorry I missed. I will see you in hell, amigo! Don't they even get a trial, lieutenant? Martial law has been proclaimed in this region. Immediate execution for any outlaw caught killing or looting. Martial law, lieutenant? Since when? Ever since that convoy was massacred. Well, lieutenant, I think we can proceed on our journey. Thank you for your kindness. Not yet. I'd like to ask a favor of the lieutenant. What is it, Mrs. Allen? That's the cemetery of the fort over there, isn't it? That's right, ma'am. I'd like my husband to be buried there. What are you saying, daughter? She needs a good rest. So does ambrose. Enough running. Enough danger. Enough fear. My husband deserves a better repose. But Claire, he belongs at home with the rest of us. No, Ben. He belongs here, in the fort he once commanded. In a soldier's grave among soldiers. And fort Brent will be proud to have him. Lieutenant, I'd like him buried at once. Yes, ma'am. Firel Here you are, Mrs. Allen. I don't understand, Claire. Once you got so far as getting the coffin buried, why didn't you go all the way? Lieutenant would have listened. - You'd be free. - But you wouldn't, Ben. I don't count much, anyhow. Pa, he's not a forgiving man. Whatever happens, it was well worth it, just to see the look oh father Jonas's face. Pa, let's get her, and I mean now. Jeff's right, pa. Let's kill that witch. We're too close to the fort. I'll tell you when. Here. We camp here. Now, pa? I'll take care of it myself. Take care of what, pa? It appears I ain't been making myself clear! Perhaps it is my fault that the bounty the good lord sent us is now six feet under. Your fault? Pa, she's the one who did it. You know that. Now's the time to stop her mouth for doing it. Let's get it over with! If this girl had understood that we never killed out of bloodlust, never robbed out of greed, she'd never pull a mean, sneaky trick like that. You see, daughter, whatever we've done, it's for a new confederation of states created under god. You never realized that before, did you? That's what I thought. But now that I've explained it, do you understand? It's not just the money we covet... But what it will accomplish for the confederacy. Ben, take your brothers. Go to the cemetery, dig it up. Bring that coffin back. I'll wait here with Claire. There it is. How can you tell? Freshly dug. The earth's still soft. Let's dig. Gimme that. Look out! Come on. Of course Ben's different from the others. Had a different mother. Little sensitive for my taste. Worked out just fine for you, didn't it? Just fine. Cold, daughter? Here. This'll warm you up. What are you doing? What do you think? That coffin goes back to pa as it is. One shot and we'd have the whole fort down on us. You wouldn't dare. Your pistols, quick! I don't want any jokes. You'd better pray they come back. Or I'll kill you. Pal pa, we're herel Ben. There she is, pa, we got it back. Claire. You all right? Oh, Ben. Thank god you arrived. This is what protects the coffin. Brought it back from the dead. Sure, pa, a sign from heaven. Ran into trouble? Yeah... me. But that's all over now. This is where we part company. What are you saying? Me and Claire are taking off, pa. Right now. Ben, I won't allow you to turn traitor. Traitor to what? - The south. - The south surrendered. Not us, not the hellbenders, the regiment I command and you serve. You're not in command! And I've listened too long. Look at her. How far do you think she'll get in this condition? She's sick. If you want to quit, do it right. Yeah. Wait till you get home, where she can get back on her feet. Then the decision is yours. I won't stand in your way. I can't let you go now. You're too important to me. Maybe you two believe in the cause, maybe you don't. Maybe I believe enough for us all. Important thing is, we've got the money back. And this time, we go all the way. Whoa! There it is, boys. The hondo. There it is. We cross it now, pa? Too risky to cross tonight, can't afford to lose the horses. We'll swim her in the morning. How do you feel? What are you doing with that coffin? I'm giving the coach to Claire. She's very sick. Only for tonight, pa. It'll all be over in a couple of days, honey. Then we'll be free. What about it? It's ready. Hey! Save some for me. Ten long miles I been a-whiffin' and a-sniffin' ain't no use wasting good lead on me, mister. I'm near dead of starvation already. No sense in killing him. Feed him and send him on his way. Thank you, senor. Don't get your tail in an uproar. You're last in line. Where you hail from? From under a rock. That's where they say we all begin, crawling out from underneath something. Buenos noches, senor. Buenos noches. A heap of good noches to your sefiorita too! While you been crawling, spot any Indians around here? There's a mess of them wickiups about six miles back. Peaceful-looking types. Least last time I saw 'em. If a man could only chow down this way regular! Time for a little shut-eye. No shut-eye for you, finish your grub and beat it. Where'm I gonna get this time of night? Me so all-fired footsore, it's like walking on a stump. Just look at this foot. I ain't gonna bother anybody. Just curl up and go to sleep. I said beat it. That fellow in the coffin? He's better off than me. He's got a roof over his head. Anybody kicks him gets a sore foot. - Care to join him? - Sure, young fella, but not before my time. Lemme stay, snooze a spell. I'll bed down wherever you say, even next to the coffin. I'll spend the whole night through praying for that fellow inside, which must warm your heart to extend to a miserable cuss like me the milk of human kindness. Find yourself a blanket. And don't pray too loud or you'll wake us up. Gracias. Gracias, senor, muchas gracias. Gracias, senor. Jeff, take the first watch. It's Ben's turn, pa. Brother Ben don't do no more watching. It's him what needs watching. Pa, quick! Someone killed the horses. - Where's the beggar? - Hereabouts. Come on. Move over! Senorita, you stay where you are. Let me see your hands. I don't wanna hurt you none. I had to get rid of your horses so's you couldn't follow me. "Ceptin' just the one... That's for me. What do you want? Your boots. Yours, yours, yours, and yours. I got delicate feet. Come on, get a move on. Not bad, eh? Hey, you, you gimme your jacket, huh? Hey, you. You love your brother like the good book says? Well, kick him in the groin. I said kick him in the groin. Hard, yeah. Hey, you. You like to turn the other cheek like the good book says? You hit him, hit him. I said hit him. That's good. Now, those gun belts, I can sell them. Quick. And those reins behind you. And that blanket. Give me that saddle, everything. You're too greedy, friend. You can't carry all that. You got a point there, senor. What about your coffin? Stuff would fit real snug in there. That's sacrilege. You've got to respect the dead. I don't even respect the living, friend. You. Open up that coffin. Heave his stinking carcass in the river. Then fill it up with my haul, lash it on the horse. The rest of you stay put. Get moving. That's what I call using your head, boss. Pal I'll take care of myself when I get home. See, Ben? Told you I'd still need you. But with only one horse, we sure can't cross the hondo. Pa? Why don't we just split up, divide the cash, and meet at the ranch? It'd be a whole lot safer all the way around. Stick together, you understand? Together. Go back to that Indian village and buy some horses. Right. I'll go, pa. Why isn't Jeff back? Give me a drink of water. Ben. Please take me away. I'm sick, Ben. Take me home. I will, honey. I promise. Pa! For god's sake, pal - where are the horses? - Damn Indians ambushed me a couple of hours from here. Thought you said they were peaceful. They are. What are you talking about? Barely made it back alive. They're after me, pa, we gotta get out of here! Too late. What have you done, Jeff? Damn fool. What do you want? Him. Give him to us or you all die. He took and killed my daughter. Don't listen to him! She egged me on! You wouldn't let them get me, would you, Ben? You're still my brother, Jeff. I'm not gonna let them Indians get you. - How you gonna stop them? - With what's inside this damned coffin! Don't move! You gone mad, nat? No, I ain't. Nat, you can't. He's our brother. I ain't got no brothers. Not since we took that convoy. There's over a million in cash in there and I ain't trading one dollar of it for your rotten life! Now, get! No! Ben! I'll get it home, boys. I'll get it home. Ben. You dug up the wrong coffin. Get it home, boys. Pal come back! Pal
