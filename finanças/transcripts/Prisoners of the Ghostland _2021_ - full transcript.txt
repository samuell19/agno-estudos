He's a mean looking cuss, ain't he? They say... you're a veritable phantasm, that you have slipped through the firm grasp of the law more than any other man on God's great earth. They also say... you're the one who robbed the Bleufeur National Bank in P29, killing, among others, three tellers, two security guards, a retired Navy colonel, his mother, and a small boy, whose only crime was masticating a sweet cheery cherry gumball. Suit, please, Yasujiro. My granddaughter, Bernice, has been lost to us, sir. [CAR DOOR SHUTS] Ah, thank you, Yasujiro. Bernice. I have a fondness for black leather. I tell you truly, sir, my granddaughter, my sweet sugar pie, I would have her returned to me. [REVOLVER COCKS] I would have her returned to me posthaste. And you, sir... you, sir, I am told, are the man to do the job. Bernice. [SCREAMS] Bernice! Bernice! Bernice! THE GOVERNOR: Uh, Yasujiro. [SOBBING] Bernice... [GIGGLING] [LAUGHTER] [LAUGHTER INTENSIFIES] Oh, my gosh. I've seen better. ♪ My grandfather's clock was too large for the shelf ♪ ♪ So it stood 90 years on the floor ♪ ♪ It was taller by half than the old man himself ♪ ♪ Though it weighed not a pennyweight more ♪ ♪ It was bought on the morn of the day that he was born ♪ ♪ And was always his treasure and pride ♪ ♪ But it stopped, short never to go again ♪ ♪ When the old man died ♪ 90 years without slumbering ♪ Tick tock, tick tock ♪ His life seconds numbering ♪ Tick tock, tick tock ♪ It stopped, short never to go again ♪ ♪ When the old man died My, my! Don't that fit nice and snug. Just beyond the point where we now stand lies a stretch of highway where evil reigns. It's ghost! Ghost, I tell you! Ooh! - [SPEAKS JAPANESE] - [CHILDREN SHOUT] In the way of the road! - They can be anywhere. - Shut up! Now you see them. Now you don't. I said shut up! Oh, it's alright, Sheriff. I know many who subscribe to that... supernatural mumbo jumbo. Ghosts... perhaps. Or, maybe, it's a bunch of godless sodomites that have taken the land prisoner. I fear my sweet Bernice has fallen into their perverse lair. I can see why you want her back. What did he say?! I'll kill you! [CROWD CHANTING] [CHANTING CONTINUES] [CHANTING CONTINUES] Yahhh! [GAGS] [CHANTING CONTINUES] THE GOVERNOR: No man is yet to be a worthy opponent for my Yasujiro. I warn you, sir, to quarrel with me is a mistake many men have made never to make again. Better zip up there. You don't want to catch a cold. [CHUCKLES] [WHIRRING] It's a remarkable device, isn't it? Let me point out some of its finer qualities. Each arm is equipped with an explosive device. Oh, it's a protective measure. These devices are connected to a neuro sensor, which can recognize the impulse of a man intending to strike a helpless woman. Should that impulse be detected, an alarm will sound and if unheeded, detonation will occur. Your trousers are also equipped with explosives. The one at each testicle. [LAUGHS, SPEAKS JAPANESE] [SPEAKS JAPANESE] - Boom! - [LAUGHTER] Really? I would have my Bernice returned to me unsoiled, sir, so best mind your manners. Oh, now, I'm sure you've noticed the charges around your throat. You attempt to remove or alter in any way this magnificent wardrobe... well, I think you get the idea, sir. If you can crawl your dog's hide into the unknown and the unholy, rescue my Bernice, return her to me unscathed to this very spot, you will walk away a free man. SUSIE: No! Don't give my sister to him! He's the devil. A real devil! [CACKLES] Da-da-da-da-da-da! Da-da-da-da-da-da! Da-da-da-da-da-da! Da-da-da-da-da-da! Da-da-da-da-da-da! [LAUGHS HYSTERICALLY] - [CROWD GASPS] - [CAR DOOR SLAMS] Well, I assume you have accepted my offer. Shin? Give the man the keys to his automobile. HERO: What is this? Each bulb on that colorful display indicates the passing of 24 hours. at the conclusion of three days, Bernice must speak her name into the spectrograms microphone. It is programmed to identify her lovely voice. Once voiceprint recognition has been achieved, the device will reward you with two extra days to complete your task. At the end of five days, if you have not returned with Bernice to get your suit unlocked and removed, the explosives will detonate all at once. I am certain this will prompt a speedy execution of your task. You got me, son? What are you gonna unlock it with? Why... right here. Godspeed. Any God can bear to look upon your face.
