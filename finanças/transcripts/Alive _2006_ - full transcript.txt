You want it for slaughtering? No, a gift for a friend. Right. Hey, sniper, go and see what's keeping Petrovna so long. Is that it? The moon rises, takes a knife, I'll be slashing right and left, Now it's your turn in the game. Shoot, what are you doing here? Is it drinkable? Why don't you go home? I'll go today. Take some, major. Oh! Did you hit the jackpot? Well, I bought some presents. It's dangerous to go around with this lot of money Major, where was our lieutenant buried? Somewhere around here. Ask his wife. You cleaned up 10 grand on him, too? Look, man, did you join the army to make money? A guy came to ask, just like you: How much for my contusion? Fucking warriors... You better thank your platoon commander for saving your life. - Don't be such a miser - I don't give a fuck. Take it. More? Get lost. Maybe you want rehabilitation? There's a special center... - How much? - About 200 dollars. Boiko V.T. Make up your mind and call me. It's not a problem if you have dough and talent Hey, man, what is it? Man! Mind your hands! Hey, Spotty, are you crazy? Lads! Let's go? Well, you did that creep in. Now what? Why cast dough in my teeth? I didn't fight for dough. Oh yeah, you're a hero. Nikich and myself wanted to make some money. I didn't. Fighting for money, we died, Fighting for an idea - he's alive. For money? Then why'd you cover me up? Because you were injured Why'd you stick out? Moroz told me to. Don't know why you stayed: Because you can't shoot I can't shoot? Bullshit! I always hit the bull's eye at the shooting range. I wish I'd taken a sniper's rifle instead of that thing. Stop moaning! Am I better off? What? Is the wood itching? It happens. I read about it. It's called 'phantom pains.' You're lucky it's just the leg. Or else you'd have 'phantom orgasms' You look very much alive. We are fucking 'alive'. Only invisible. But I can see you. So, someone wants it that way. - Who? - Ask something else. Guys, where're you? - 'Up' where? - Up there. Why do you point that way? - Hey, are you in hell? - Surely not in paradise. - How about devils? No one's around here. The bare steppe and heights like at Shali. And so much snow! Who was first? To stiffen? Nikich, of course. Bullshit. I closed your eyes with my hand. I'll never forget it. How unthankful! Hey, sonnies. Who? Us? Can I cadge 7 or 8 rubles for beer? I haven't got any. Yes. Women have no intellectual conscience. We come up with an idea, and they dish it out to you as if it were their own. You can't impress a woman, You can only surprise her. Her man has a heart attack and she doesn't care. Sorry, dudes! Thanks. Hey, can he see us? No fucking way. He's pissed like a newt. He's seeing things. - How are you up there? - We're okay, just cold. And dying for a smoke. I wish I'd taken a sniper's rifle. You can't shoot anyway. Why are you still carrying arms? Why! It's registered, Kir! River DON I expected you earlier. Some delays at the base. That's for you. Thank you. Serezha, why go to such expense? It's okay. I talked to Gurianov, he promised you a job. As security guard. You want your dumplings with vinegar or sour cream? Doesn't matter. You liked sour cream. Fine. - And you? - I'm not hungry. Gurianov's unhappy with this staff. They drink all day, he says. What else can they do? No harm to keep the company from time to time. Mom, I don't drink. I don't mean like at all: But measured. Measured? That's fine. To the parents. Yes. Hey, Grey, did you kill many? - I dunno. - Don't be so modest. Is it hard to kill a man? - No sweat. - I'm not asking you. I iced a con in the army. Caught him in the restricted area. I said 'Halt' and gunned him down. - What's the fucker smoking? 'Prima.' No, with filter ...and blue guts. Hey, girls, help the guys. - How are you two getting on? - I'm not sure. - He was such a great guy. - Isn't he now? His leg's chopped to the balls. He can't get it up, I guess. Kir, say something. Hey, Semina! They chopped off my leg to the knee. So I can still have a hard-on. Wow! You work on your hands. - Take care, Grey - Be my guest. See you. - Shall I wait? - No, gotta work. We'll be in touch. - Need help? - Yeah. - Serge, you took the key? - Yep. - So long, Tanya. - Bye. I'll take her place, her place, her place, oh yeah!

No Chinese noodles for me. - Take it, it sells well. - It just takes storage place Take it. - Load it back. - I'm not gonna shuttle for you. - I said: Load it back. - You're a bitch. - He fucks her. - That's a big if. - You sleep with him? - Why should I? As if I didn't know the job. - A fat lot you know. - He fucks her 200%. If he touches me, they roll him into asphalt.

What do we do? Ask me something else. Who's Vovka? Vovka? He makes sure the wogs don't shake me. I see. No, you don't. Does it hurt? No, I'm just not used to it. Sorry. Is it all over between us? Because of the leg? I saw German limbs on TV. You have a Russian one? Yep. Licensed. Vova'll find you a job and you can buy a German one. Oh, I forget, they paid you a grand per day over there.

No, you don't. - We'll talk tomorrow. - Why tomorrow? I haven't seen my mother yet. Of course. - Well, what? - Nothing. Serge... How'd you know we were talking about you? My heart told me. I knew it. Hey, can she hear us? Like hell she can. She just loves that goof. Bye, boys. I can't make out the fucking women. You are gonna see world's best ghost with an engine. Wild, but cute. Sergei? - When did you come? - Just now. Tanya is a good girl - Did you write to her? - A couple times. She waited two years but you did one more stint. Why? I've got to go to Moscow to see a friend. - When? - Tomorrow. What's up, Sergei? Nothing. Don't panic. I don't. I gotta go. He saved my life, I owe him thanks, or not? Oh yes. You owe everybody all the time. - The war included. - Easy, mom. Please calm down. You're back... but you never say a word... - Am I a stranger to you? - You are not. Serge, dear, don't withdraw into your shell. - I beg you. - I won't. Oh, I found this... in your shirt You probably need it? Yes, thanks. You want some water? If you want to tell us about ghosts call 222... - Near Shali. - No, near Grozny. Near Shali. I had that haircut then. Let's paint the town red! That's for you, Igor. So light. Move the lamp closer, I can't see a thing. Hey, Igor... Can?t you wait for a toast? Kir, say something... - To you, guys. - The third will drink to us. Here's to the survivors. What did I say? Wish I could sniff a woman and... Make sure you don't get drunk. Remember how we left him with the builders in Khankala? I thought you didn't smoke. - I don't really. - Don't start. Gimme a cigarette. Remember, you hooked a Winston from me? - When? I don't smoke. - That's why I asked. - Did he give it back? - No. That's why we're screwing around The steppe instead of paradise. - Debts must be returned. - It was... ...for Larisa. So that's who was fucking the Senior Lieutenant. - Sergei? - Just remembered a joke. Fuck you both. - I'm fucked already. - We too, I just wonder who by. No blasphemy! What did I say? Hey, what's going on? You know what. Remember you threw a grenade into the yard? They never shot back. Because you threw that grenade. Now I know. Now you went round the bend, fucking samurai. You can be so tedious, Igor. Hey, guys, why the hell did you go with me? Honest. Military secret. To you, guys. I was thinking: I am drinking with stiffs! Nikich, he called us stiffs. Scumbag! Kir's an idiot. He'll be jailed. Bite your tongue. I'm sorry for her. Maybe Slava could help. He said his dad's a big wig. Why didn't he help him dodge the army? Slava's a regular bull shitter. Thank God I have a sister, or mom would've gone mad. Guys! - Again? - Stay here. What is it? Nothing. - What day is it? - 38th. I don't know. Cheer up. Let's go! Why we keep on following him? Ask me something else. Why can he see us, but others can't? I reckon: We're his conscience, sort of: What? It's all, kind of, because of him: He left us holding the bag. Quiet. Hey, guys. Not that it matters now. I mean, I'm sorry, guys. Feeling guilty? Then repent! We're angels and you're a sinner. Kneel down! Fuck you. We laid our young lives for him... ...and he fucks us. - You're ungrateful. - For me? - No, shit, for Pushkin. - For Putin? - I didn't ask you to! Forgive me for staying alive. I wish I could punch you. You're welcome. Give me a break. You are alive, right? So live and have fun. Booze and screw gals. Forget about conscience. - Have you been to Moscow? - Sure. It's my first time. Where were you buried? In a cemetery. At the cemetery all is peaceful and quiet, No friends, no enemies in sight. All is civilized, all is dignified, I mean absolute paradise. Here's to our meeting, Kir. And to us, too. Go on, down it! So you haven't been home yet? I'm looking after my daughter. Guess what: She was calling me 'uncle' at first. I even asked Lena to explain that. The neighbor! I had a present for you. But have it no longer. - What present? - A small knife. Drafts. Cool. Let's drink to you, Slava. - Thanks for helping me out. - It's ok. Hey, give us some vodka, too. Ok, we can take care of ourselves. Masha's crying. We're up already! Look at that uncle... She likes you, Kir. You should train to be a teacher. - How old is she? - Four. Bright girl, she is. How old are yours, Igor? I need another drink. Bitch. That's a marker. Here, you draw... Put your hand down Make it three, Kir. To our guys. To Igor, to Nikich, to 'Fly', to Sanya Sitnikov... To Moroz. Igor, they're drinking to us. Rest in peace, guys. It's as if they're with us. I am going to cry! Heavenly Kingdom... The enemy knocked out 100. We held the ground for about an hour. An hour? No more than 15 minutes. Igor shouldn't have stayed there. Tell him: It's none of his fucking business! They came from the top. And Nikich - alone. How do you know? You'd passed out. My, eh, third eye opened. Don't you believe me? I'll turn round and tell you how many fingers you show. Third eye, eh? OK. - Two. - Two. - Eight. - Eight. And now? Now a bird's flying out See those hands? Kir... What's wrong with you? Idiots. Kir, it's not dangerous for you - Morons. - Who? These two morons, Igor and Nikich. There. Maybe some coffee for you? - Nikich, come over here. - Out it. Are you nuts? He'll think I went potty. - It's his wife. - Beautiful? - Who's there? - A neighbor. I made Masha dinner. Sergei, wait for me downstairs. I'll feed Masha, and then we go for a drink. He won't come. Why don't you drop in? No, that wasn't the deal. I never really liked Slava, he's a sly ass. I dunno. He carried me 15 kilometers. So what? He now has a wife, a daughter. A family. He appeared in my dreams. Kir, was the herring tasty? It was alright. Alright! What did I tell you? Well, the old woman passed away. She'll be with you now? No. There's no peace-niks here. People keep dying. Fucking peaceniks... They got nothing else to do. Kir, is it scary to be with us? Nope. I'm the scariest ghost in the world. I wish I was there. And they were all alive, Fly, Sanya, Gerych. - Moroz. - Sure. - Us too. - Sure. Slavik also Slavik? No. Over my dead body. I guess I'll join the mob. - Be a killer. - Another sniper. You should go see Peresvet. He's, somewhat, contused. He's charmed. If his APO is shelled, every man's safe. He marks your forehead and the snipers miss. - You saw him? - I saw his seals. Who's Peresvet? A monk, a former officer. He became a monk after Afghanistan, then made it to Chechnya. He was caught and told to become a mullah. - He said: Fuck off. - Is he really a monk? - A kind of. - Sh-sh. What's he listening to? What is it? Shit. What was Slava saying about a club? A club? It's my first and last time in Moscow. SPLEEN SEIZE THE OPPORTUNITY! I was thinking about us. Maybe we are just contused. Guess what. We're in hospital. The guy's dead, but... 'Spartak' is a champ! Hey you, fag! I'm the scariest ghost in the world. Cheers! FATE HAS OHOSEN US God! Keeping silent? Fuck. Careful. There's a guy over there... I know. What? Wait. How do I get to Chertanovo? I'm not from here. The metro will open soon. Ask there. How do I get there? Can you show me? - You fought in the war? - Well, yes. How long? Will you help me? I need to see my friends in Strogino. It's not far. I'll pay. Hey, mom, why don't we make a little money for the nappies? We've been driving all night. How can you pick the first comer? It's ok. I'll be back in an hour. I need to. Not for me. - Watch out. - Right. - He may steal the car. - I have the keys. - Can I smoke? - Sure. - Do you smoke? - I mustn't. - Illness? - Cloth. You mean it's Satan's censer? - What about beer? - If I'm not driving The same with us. And women? Okay, sorry. How long have you worked as a priest? We serve. - Do they pay well? - It depends. Why'd you join the clergy? Why'd you join the army? For money? Yeah, they all say that. 'You did it for money.' - Didn't you? - I did, partly. I needed money for the wedding. - When was that? - Some time ago. - How long ago? - Does it matter? I was ordained last Sunday. Wow! This must be celebrated, buddy. - You're already loaded. What's your name? Father Sergius. I'm Sergei too. You know a joke? No, I won't, it's dirty. Out it. The police will stop us. Not with a priest driving. Stop priesting me. Are you baptized? I'm a Muslim. I'd fight for Chechens if they were on our side. Those monsters should be dead, But we can learn from them, too. What happens if you kill a man? In the war? - Does it matter? - It does. I didn't like the way things were. I don't like the way things are. You and I... Can you show me the way to Strogino? Gimme a cigarette. - Do you know? - What? The way to Strogino. Your shitty Strogino is over there. How can we get there? Just take this path. Riding around, rickets... Freak! Well, here we are. Is this enough for the nappies? I was only joking. Well, thank you, Serge. Or is it Father Sergius? No offense, man... good luck Take care. And if you killed not in the war? Just like that? - What should one do? - Repent. I thought so. You forgot your map. I'll find it, with God's help. You want me to help you? No. You better go back to your wife. - I can give you a lift back. - No, thanks. Go. Go. What can I do? Hey! Wait, asshole! - Wait or else... - No way. Superstitious bastard! Well? The bastard runs fast. There were oodles of everything. His likes ought to be killed. - Pour me a drink too. - You are driving! My cassock tells the tale. It's lukewarm. What's that: A military base or a village? - Shit. It's swollen. - Hold it. Crutches would come in handy. Let's get going. Grab the leg. Let me carry you. - I'm heavy. - Not really. You are heavy. A graveyard. The village must be close by. This is the village. Why didn't you tell me about the graveyard? A village indeed. If you had told me, I'd have sung a mass for them. Well, I didn't. What are their names? Why don't we ask? Igor! Nikich! Guys! Here they are. Hi, guys. Nikich, where'd you go? I waited for a whole day. Hey, buddy. Fly, what's your Tatar mug doing here? Hi, Sanya. Why don't I see Moroz? Get that bottle, Serezha. We're gonna have a merry time. Nikich, Igor, where are you? Let's go on a spree, guys. Father Sergius... No, thanks. Whatever. Come on, let's get sloshed. You think I'm not with it? I saw those jerks alive like I see you now. Are you offended? Why do you think I'm here? Have a drink, stiffs. No snacks, sorry, Nikich. You got a chewing gum? Here, sniff it. That's specially for you, Igor. Give me a cigarette. Are they all from your platoon? No. Gena Nikich, Igor Lagutin... Sanya Sitnikov, deputy commander. Mushailov, the 'Fly'... I saw Igor and Nikich alive a couple days ago. They say nobody's up there. Up where? There. Perhaps it wasn't them. Who else? Demons. You are: They say there's nobody there and it's cold. Could it be hell? I don't know. What a question! Hell, I guess. Where else? I'll ask him to take me, too. What do you want? Read the Psalter for the deceased. Don't! Why? Because you should've done it before? Where was he, your God? 'Fly, is a Muslim. His dick's circumcised. - That's ok. - Piss off... Boiko, Victor I'm off. Thanks, guys. What took you so long? - I've been waiting for you. - Oh, you have? - We've been waiting! - Let's go, stiff. - Where? - Ask me something else. Rest in peace, guys.
