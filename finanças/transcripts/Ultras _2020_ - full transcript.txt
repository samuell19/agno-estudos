SASÀ LIVES You made it at last! Guys, I've been callin' you for three hours! It's Ciro's fault. Three hours to get that Little Tony quiff. It's not even in, now! It's about style.

Come on, fuck! Apache! This girl calls me... "Come on, let's go out." I was totally out of it. I sent Reggio instead. And all the time, guys, she was calling me by his name, "Roby!" I'm like, "Yeah, yeah, love!" Ever shagged a girl like this? We shag 'em in the family! Apache! Guys... How you doin'? Fine. You? You bring the bombs? Yeah, we're loaded. Can I set one off now? You speak too much! Learn to shut up. Well done. I'll tell you when you can set them off. When will you take us to an away game? -When? -Take us! -If you're good, I'll take you. -But we're not good, you know that. Teach your brother as well. See you later, lads. See ya, Pechegno. This is our fucking terrace! -So cool! -He's a beast. We're the Apache! Fucking move! Honour our friends! Let's hear it for our friends who aren't here today! Honour to the banned! Honour to the banned! Honour to the banned! Honour to the banned! Honour to the banned! Honour to the banned...! Hey, Mcintosh. Hey, Sandro. POLICE STATION Everything OK? Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Napoli playing at home. Trying to extend this run of victories... May we? Good afternoon. Good afternoon. ID. Still with the ID, Officer? Are we still at this stage? Damn it! Here you are. All the time we spend here, we might as well work with you. Alessandro Russo... The visitors are fighting to stay up, a situation that seemed unlikely at New Year. While the Azzurri want to fulfil the dream of winning... DAY 34 OF THE CHAMPIONSHIP No problem for the home side in these last few minutes... The Blues winning 3-0, and controlling the game without any difficulty... Ist das mayonnaise? No, it's salmon, cheese and salmon... America'! You wanna get rid of these two? Go away, oh! Come on, move! Raus! Raus! Eins zwei Polizei! -What's wrong with you? -Oh, Michelone, what did I do? Played the arsehole you are. -One more goal, I've won my bet. -A nice present, Michelone! -I'll take you to dinner. -Dinner and then a present! You're not just taking us to dinner and saving on the present. I should kick you all out! You lost me those two customers. I didn't do anything. It was you two. We saved their lives! So it's our fault you couldn't sell your shit sandwiches? You still goin' on? I'll give you the money, America', but lemme hear the game. -If I win this bet...! -No! Can we not watch it on TV once in a while? On the radio! Not on TV! Now it's a corner, as well! ...Looking to the last four games, and preparing for the meeting in Rome, the last match which will decide this championship... How come you've got the keys? My uncle got a rebuilding job here. Get in, quick. Fuck off, you shitty Neapolitans! Oi, Sandro! Hey, Angelo. -Open up. -Yeah. -Oh, bloody hell! -I'm destroyin' you. -Where are you going? -Did you fucking see that? -Fuck off, you thumped him. -You don't know how to play! Don't piss me off...! That's enough. I'm not playing. Let's eat. -Finish the game! -I don't want to play any more. -Come on, finish the game. -Enough! I don't want to play! Let's eat, Angelo, come on! -Come on, Sandro, finish the game! -No! -Sandro! -No! -Come here and finish... -Finish what? It's 6-0! Come on! Sandro! Don't get pissed off. Come here. Always with a joystick in your hand. Have you not got a girl? I can't move for women. Half the school's after me. While you never get laid! Half the school? What, are you going to school now as well? Doobie school, you not know? Shut up! What are you doing? -Spaghetti, oil and garlic. Ready! -Damn... Spaghetti, oil and garlic? What are you feeding me now? What are you talking about? Come and see this spag I've made! It's really something. At least put some cheese on it. Angelo, you don't put cheese on spaghetti with garlic and oil! Who ever heard of such a thing? Cheese with garlic and oil! No way! I refuse even to give you it. At most I could do you "runaway clams". What's that? When you sprinkle it with a load of parsley. It ends up tasting like spaghetti with clams. They used to make it when people were short of money. -Mum made it for us. -Enjoy your meal. You too, Angelo. It was really cool today at the game. A bunch of us got beneath the Brescia end, and we launched a load of bombs, you should have seen them. Running in all directions they were, like ants. Bombs, Angelo? You've got bombs in your head! What are you doing? Nothing, I wanted a sip. So ask. Sandro, can I have a sip? -Now you can have a sip. -Thank you, Sandro. You're welcome. Where did you get this? At a party? -Someone gave it to me. -That explains it. Two puffs and he's out of it. -Fuck you, Angelo. -He's totally out of it! Watch for the lines. Oi, Lardarse! What the fuck have you done here, you dick? -Maestro. -You OK? D'you want me to kick you out? What are they doin'? You deserve a slap in the face! I just told you to watch the lines. Did you understand? Oi! Yes or no? Gabbiano... Hey. You're such a dick! Cool it a bit, will you? -He's getting on my nerves. -Go and smoke a doobie. Fiorelli'... we explained this to you. D'you wanna learn, yes or no? The lines need to be straight. Guys, is there a can of white? Sure, here. Sort that mess. See? Easy. Look how good Angelo is. You see this hand? Tomorrow you can come to mine and do the bathroom! Fiore', handsome! You need to chill and keep calm! They're getting to me! They're kids, they're learning. Come on. Hey, Mohica'. Let me have a shot on that bike, I'll fly from here to Ponticelli! Do you not have a home to go? You wanna take us to your house? Always in the fucking way! "Let's burn the capital"? What's this? Pechegno, have you turned stupid or what? It's the banner. What's the problem? You're doing a banner without the authorisation of the group? -It's done now. -Oi, you shut up! We decided the banner in the stadium. -You? -Yeah. And who the fuck are you? We founded this group. We've got the stadium bans. We're the ones who decide. Bara', if we wait for you for every decision, we'll be old men. Here's another one! Yeah, but decisions are made in meetings with everyone. And you know that. And then away fans are sure to be banned for Rome. So? What do we care? We need to go anyway. You taught us that! It's our last chance. Are we meant to hang about here like dicks? Maybe you didn't understand, bro'. Listen to me... nobody's going to Rome! Nobody's to go anywhere near Rome! The debate ends here, full stop! Now get rid of this fucking thing off the wall! Come here, you! Mcinto', you really are a dickhead as well, though! -Let's get this down! -How was I meant to know? What were you doing here? Why are you getting mixed up in this shit? Sandro, where are we going? -It's a surprise, don't worry. -We've been walking for three hours. What is this place, Sandro? Angelo! Angelo, where are you? I'm here, Sandro. What the fuck are you doing there? Come down and help me. Coming. Angelo, get that sheeting and put it here. If we get the banner dirty, Barabba will kill us. That year with Atalanta we beat the shit out each other. I even got stabbed. I've still got the scar. That's gross. A few months later I got a message from one of their leaders, inviting us to this Atalanta party. They have this party every year, and this message said, "We'd be honoured to welcome our Neapolitan rivals". We had a laugh at this. It made no sense. We're enemies. They're inviting us to a party. Are they mad? But about ten of us got together and went. Barabba, Mcintosh, O'Nan and your brother Sasà as well. We set off in two cars and arrive there. Angelo, when we got there, it was total madness. Thousands of people, singing, tear gas, smoke bombs, a tank, even! A tank? Angelo, a tank. They're madder than us! Anyway, we took up position in a corner, all of us suspicious and unsure, ready to kick off at the first sign of trouble, also because we'd gone ready for anything. We had bars, bats, chains... These two guys from Bergamo appeared in front of me, and go, "Hey, Napoli, come on, relax a little! Have a beer, it's cool!" in that weird accent they have. We look at each other, what do we do? We decide to have a beer. We have the first, the second, the third... Fifteen minutes later, Angelo, we're all drunk. Barabba was dancing and pouring beer on his head. O'Nan was acting cool, like a dancing instructor... Mcintosh hitting on anything in a skirt... They decide to take us to a disco. We get to the disco, we keep drinking, all of us drunk, we all ended up hugging like a big gang of poofs... In the end I realised that between Naples and Bergamo, North and South, deep down, we're still us... WILD SPIRIT I see this guy, I'm, like, "Fuck, I know him!" Where from? Boom! I realise who he is... -Who? -The guy that stabbed me. -No! What did you do? -I swear! I gave him a Glasgow kiss and he hit the ground. Soon as the others saw me, Barabba started hitting them, and he drew blood every time. -Michelone, he's a giant... -I can imagine... He was picking them up like rag dolls, banging them on the ground... And your brother was like an eel when he fought, cos he was skinny... Bang, bang, bang and away... But then in the end... Sorry, I have to go. You need to go? Where are you going? I need to go. You really are a slut! Drop dead! You can't leave me like this... You wanna watch the game? -No, sorry, I'm working on Sunday. -Take a day off... Get into the house. -Ma, what d'you want? -Get in, I said! What d'you want? I'm talking, can't you see? No, I can't. Move! Angelo, go home. -Bye, Sandro. -Bye, Angelo. You're still hanging about with my son? Stefania, I'm just watching he doesn't fuck up. Have you seen yourself? Seriously, you think you have anything to teach him? You already got one of my sons killed. I never want to see you again. Get out of here. Move! Take it easy, you're gonna wreck the bed. Hang on, I'm coming. But you didn't come... I'm sorry. Yes, I did, before, didn't you notice? Yeah, maybe I know when. What's this tattoo thing here? Nah, nothing... It's a retro gecko. It's kind of out of style. Well, you wanna talk about mine? Which one? Look at this... What is it? It was supposed to be two dolphins, but they look like salted anchovies! You under a spell? Sorry, I'm not used to it... To what? Seeing an arse? Silly... No, it's cos you did everything. Well, every now and then you just have to follow your instinct! What are you doing? You leaving? Yeah... Stay a while, we'll have another joint. No, look... you don't have to say that. No, I mean... Look, I'd stay, if it was up to me... but... My son's at home. I can't go back with dilated pupils, you know how it is. Ah, OK. What'll we do? Can I call you? All right... I'll see you. Yeah? I've got a membership at the Stufe. -All right... -Bye. Bye. -Hey, Peppe. -Hey, you OK? -Cool. -Hey, Mcintosh. The pen doesn't work! Some police station, this. Do they give you toilet paper at least? No...we bring our own. I should have known. DAY 35 OF THE CHAMPIONSHIP Batman, Perastor, Barrilbisukseir... This isn't going to be five minutes! What are we doing here? Play this over. Over? OK. Blusbaispor, Diablaispor, under... -Aispor? With a T at the end? -No T at the end. Is it possible we couldn't scrape together 50 euros to go to Florence? Next time, we'll rob someplace. Yeah, you! The most you could rob is the deli! You'll grab two mozzarellas and four slices of smoked ham. Shut it or I'll batter you! You're pissing me off! Oi, guys, keep it down! What's he want? Get out of here! Come on, keep playing. -Oh, he's a total loony! -He's got a cue! A quick move from the right... Straight across... dribbling... Two men on him... Shoot! Shoot...! An incredible goal, two minutes from the end. The visiting fans go wild! ...Out to the corner flag, a small advantage for the Azzurri... There's a banger that took everyone by surprise, including us... That came from the visiting fan's end. There are smoke bombs as well. And there's another banger. Naples risking a game behind closed doors. Which is a shame, as they have an easy run-in to deal with. There's also a very unpleasant banner declaring "Let's burn the capital"... A stupid banner, this one, not the most sensible thing to do... Makes no sense for the team at the top... Terry! I'm sorry... You're here? So are you! Yeah, but I work here. I know. I'm gonna go and wash this off me. Are you leaving already? What else have I got to do? I wanted to ask you... I mean, invite you... To yours? No! Out someplace. To dinner. There's a place near here where they do really good fish... -Yeah? -Yeah. I go a lot, they've become friends. It's fresh stuff. What do you say? Later maybe, I finish up here soon... if you've nothing on and you fancy it... All right, but now I'm going for a shower. I'll wait for you, then? See you later? I'm warnin' you, they only use plastic plates. All right, I understand! -But it's really good. -It's really good. OK... They've got razor clams to die for. You like razor clams? Do I like razor clams? Get out of here, you daftie! Terry, excuse me a moment. -What's up? -Just a moment. Sure. What the fuck are you lot doing here? What the fuck are we doing here? We need to go now! Go where, Barabba? Did you not hear what happened in Florence? Yeah, I did. So we need to go now and kick the shit out of them. All right, I'll speak to Pechegno. Talk to Pechegno? What the fuck are you gonna say to Pechegno? -Tell me what's going on. -Nothing. -Everything's OK. -Nothing? You've lost interest in the group, your head's elsewhere, what is it? I'm fine, Barabba, don't worry. Right, if you're OK we need to go to these guys now. We'll go together like we always have done. Tell me something...me, these guys, without you, where would we be going? Are you Mohicano, or not? OK, wait... What...? -Nothing. -Another time? Yeah, we need to put it off. All right. -I'm sorry. -Don't worry. -You cool? -Yeah. Have fun. Yeah, well... -Bye. -Bye. Let's go, then, come on. Oi, wake up! Wake up, we're here. My head's sore. Come on, move, Gabbiano. Look, they're all asleep. Wake up, guys! Come on! Come on! We're in Naples, come on! Come on! Come on, wake up! Wake the fuck! Come on! The colour of my heart is white and blue... God, this guy... I was born to support you Against the law, stadium bans and repression... Look at this, what a pussy! Who is it? NancyB2003, that's old stuff now. D'you know why she's called Nancy B? You know what B means? Blowjob! I'll ask her, is B for blowjob? Go on, ask her... Does B... stand...for...blowjob? Roma fan, you piece of shit! Guys, calm down. You see what we did in Florence? Yeah? In Rome we have to be a hundred times worse! The capital! Let's burn the capital! The capital! Let's burn the capital! The capital! Let's burn the capital! The capital! Let's burn the capital! Cool it, guys. Keep calm. Hey, Sandro. Keep calm! Keep it down, guys! Keep calm. Relax... Hey, Barabba. Get down from there. Down! Dickhead, get down. Hang on... Get down. I see you're celebrating. Well done. So you do have some fucking balls. What the fuck is this? You even have the nerve to come here and celebrate? After what you did in Florence? What? You got nothing to say now? The banner, smokes bombs on the pitch... And the group knew fuck-all about it. -Come on, Sandro! -Oi! Shut it, Gabbiano, you just shut up! There are people here who've given their all for 30 years! They've given their whole lives... body and soul. Because they believe in this like they believe in God! We had meeting after meeting to decide... to avoid being used... to avoid being labelled... So what do you lot do today? What? You chuck it all down the pan! What the fuck? Have you got any brains at all? Think! Decisions are taken together. Because an ultra on his own isn't worth a fuckin' thing! You're not worth a fuckin' thing! You're a nobody! I'm a nobody. When I'm on my own, I'm a nobody! It's when I'm with you, when I'm together with all of you, that I feel like a real Apache! And that's the difference! It's the group! Have you understood? Yes or no? The cat got your tongues, eh? Go, Mcintosh. I wanna see those hands, guys! I went to Mozambique I went to Mozambique And I peeled a finger And I peeled a finger It got infected It got infected I had to get it amputated I had to get it amputated Finger! Finger! -Leg! -Leg! You wanna dance a samba? You wanna dance a samba? -Waiter... -Eh? -Waiter... -What a dick you are! Here. Let's try this thing. Ah, what the fuck! My sweatshirt. Look at this. What can I do? I've made a mess of myself! 50 years old and you can't even eat a kebab! But it'll clean up. Yeah, but I've made a total mess of it. You were a beast. Yeah, a beast. Once upon a time... 20 years ago, maybe. Look at the mess I made! Yeah, and I'm the one who can't eat a kebab. ...And the wind howls On the old terrace, facing the Gulf of Sorrento... He's got the lighter. ...A man embraces a girl... You all need to chill a bit. I've got my own. When are we goin' for another swim? Did you eat your sandwich, sonny? Here you go, Barabba. Cook yourself some mussels tonight. -Why don't you? -I'm out for dinner tonight. With her from the baths? Mohicano's in love! I really love you... I really love you... Shut up! So very much, you know It's a bond now That warms the blood Inside of our veins, you know... Look at your brother! How's it possible? You're identical. He gets a shag and you don't! What do you know about shagging? Eat your chips. -Guys! -Hey, bro'! Angelo? He still hasn't appeared. Angelo! Angelo! Angelo...! My pals are calling me, hang on. Hang on, love, my pals are calling me. Angelo! What the fuck d'you want? Get a move on! You having a wank? Come on! -What are you doin'? -Go with your idiot friends! -Come on... -Get lost! Gimme five minutes and I'll be down. Make sure you wipe yourself clean! Well, guys? Mum, I'm going out. Don't be late. Hey, Chabbù. You made it. Quiet, guys. Come here. Come on, line up here. First of all I want to thank you all... because if you're here it means you think the same way as us. We have the same mentality. I want to propose a toast... to the Apache. Who, unfortunately, are due to retire. To the Apache, guys! To the Apache! This isn't a happy day for me. Because I grew up with the Apache. They taught me everything, they were like a family to me. But as happens in every family, there comes a time when the child has to leave home. We can't miss the away games, guys... especially this year when we might win the league. We're ultras! We're like an army that defends its standard, its faith, its city. We've never been scared of anyone or anything. And nobody can tell us what we're meant to do. Because we don't give a fuck! Today we found out the game will be behind closed doors. -You know what that means? -That they're scared. Exactly! They're shitting themselves. We're going to Rome... and we're going with our new group which is born today! Come on, guys! Listen to me now. Come over here. I wanna see you all. The State passed a law And this is what it tells the cop... As soon as... As soon as you meet a fan Arrest him and bring him here As soon as he arrives at the station The cop should be trembling The law doesn't frighten us The State won't stop us In fact we won't stop The life of an ultra, everyone knows Only knows two laws... Consistency and mentality! -You've never been to Ischia? -No, I haven't. -That's impossible, it's beautiful. -I've never been! I always went to Procida. A Neapolitan who doesn't know Ischia...! I just don't... Sorry, are you Mohicano? No, you've got the wrong man. What d'you mean? Can you take our picture? You too, come. We're eating, no photos. Take this phone back. Come on, it's only a photo. What'll it cost you? Two minutes. Take this back. No photos, I said. Oi, bro', what did I ask for? A shitty photo! Take this fucking phone and go. Be good. Who the fuck do you think you are? You're a nobody. You're history. You're just an old shit! You want me to crack your skull, you shit? -I'll make you eat this gun! -Look at this, acting big with a gun! There are children here. You're asking for it! Get out of here! -You got balls? -I'll show you! I'll take both of you any time! You piece of shit! Get out of here, we're trying to work. Terry, I'm sorry, I'm really sorry. I used to go to the stadium... I was part of a group and my past is a bit unusual. And...? I really don't care. Did I ask you who you were? Did I ask what you do? -I don't think so. -No. I don't know if you noticed, but we fucked before we introduced ourselves. So it's not like we have to go for dinner together. Why don't you keep all this hassle for yourself? I promise I'll make it up to you. Fuck off! Don't be angry, you're not as pretty. Give me a smile. You love me? You love me...? No? You love me? No...? I could eat you up. Why do you have this effect on me? What are you doing? Get lost! Get out of here! I'm totally out of it. Enough. Who's gonna drive a scooter after this? They'll take us back. Look who's here, guys. Lardarse, we'd lost you! He's totally gone! That's why we couldn't find him. He's totally gone... What is that? -Give me a drink. -Don't... What's all this racket? Bloody hell! What have you done? -You want...? -Nah, I'm done in. -Everything OK, guys? -Yeah... You ready? But before we go to Rome we need to do a banner. Of course. But that's OK, we've got Giotto here. Let's be serious, guys, listen to me a minute. Rome's not a day out. They need to know the ultras are back. They need to be scared. They need to be really scared. And we need to do it for your brother. Cos I haven't forgotten Sasà. Fuck do you know about my brother? Oi, what's wrong? You offended? You talk about banners and stuff... Who says we have to go with you? So you'd rather stay with those four old shits? The Apache are the history of the ultras. Without them you wouldn't exist, you know that? Yeah? The history... I thought you had balls. Them as well. -But you're just kids. -Pechegno... Get out of here! Bloody kids! Get ou! Out! Let's go that way. -Where are you going? -Come on. Fiore, hurry up. What are you doing? Come here! Can't see dick-all. Guys, you got another joint? A joint? We're all wrecked. Look at Lardarse! He looks like Barry White! Lardarse, you taking photos as well? You're a mess! -Bastard! -Shut it! Are you pregnant? How many months? Guys, this banner's beautiful. If we take this banner to Rome, we'll really piss in those bastards' beer! And they'll tear our heads off if they see the banner. The problem is we can't go to Rome. -But we need to go... -But why can't we go? If the group doesn't come, we can't go on our own. We need to show Gabbiano and everyone what we're worth! Did you see how they treated us in the gym? Guys, the banner! Lardarse, what have you done? Stupid fat bastard! I wanted to get a photo... A photo? Officer, can I say something stupid? For a game behind closed doors, why do we need to come and sign? Come on, sign. Bureaucracy, eh? 2-0 for the home side who wanted it over and done with... DAY 36 OF THE CHAMPIONSHIP Reggio, it's all wrong. What are you saying? It's just right. The colours are wrong. I'll show you now. See? Angelo, come and look, bro'. I think he's right. Come here and see. Look at this, at the colours. It's wrong. It's blue on the outside and white inside. Guys, what have we done? Guys, I told you this was a waste of time! You bastard! I'm chucking you over! Oi, cool it! Hang on, chill! What are you hitting me for? I think it might be time to talk to Sandro, no? So why doesn't this shit go? You're Sandro's pal, you can sort this out. I've to look like a dick for this moron? You're worried about that? We're fannying about here cos you won't grow a pair! Angelo, be a man. Drop dead! Guys, today we're here again to show the banned are always here, even if we have to go and sign at the police station, we're still here! Even if the game's behind closed doors cos of some dick! The real Apache are here, us! The diehards! Those who abandoned us along the way can get to fuck! We don't follow fashions, We don't follow the masses. Apache means this as well... being ultras out of love. Americà, open this thing, go. Put the banner on the ground. You not coming? Nah, I'm busy, Mcintosh. What's this? What have they done? Who burnt the banner? Pieces of shit! Who the fuck...? Damn you! What the fuck are you banging for...? What the fuck d'you want? I've been looking for you all day. -I'm busy. -Let me come in. Come in. Do what the fuck you like, but do it quickly! Sandro, we need to decide what to do about them. Mohicano... we need to decide what to do about them. I've got people coming to dinner, please. You're preparing clams? You're preparing clams? This is what you've got to do? Let me get this clear. I've to tell you what the fuck I'm doing? Get real! Sandro, I need to go and smash Pechegno's head in. He's taking over the group. Come on, Barabba! They burnt our banner! You're worrying about hanging up a picture? Are you serious? Do you really not get it? What am I meant to get? At his age did we go to away games? Yes or no? Did we get into fights? Yes or no? Did they ban us? So what do you want now? Here it is. So they can do what the fuck they like? Sandro, you need to get this woman out your head. We need to think about counterattacking. Do you understand? We need to put them back in their place. Can I tell you something? From the bottom of my heart... Fighting, counterattacks... at the age of 50 with that belly, you're still doing this shit? We're old now. Look at yourself, we're ridiculous. What have you become? Tell me... Barabba, you should go. What'll you do if I don't? -I told you to go! -What'll you do if I don't? I'm fucking sick of it, do you understand? -I'll tear your head off! -Hands off! D'you understand? I'm fucking sick of it! You, the group... Pechegno and those four kids... all you do is fuck up! And Mohicano has to clean up the mess. I'm fucking sick of it! Get out of my face! Don't look at me like that! I'm fucking sick of it! Do you understand? What is it, Barabba? -Don't touch me. -Bye, Mohicano. -Love, what's wrong? -Nothing. It's nice here, ain't it? You wanna feel me up? Yeah? Will you give me a puff? Yeah, you're right. What's up? Nothing, everything's cool. It's good shit, this. Where'd you get it? -You like it? -Yeah. I'll give you a couple of doobies. So...you're beautiful, you're nice... you give me dope... This means you can't cook! Sure I can! What, you wanna marry me? You're mad! -You can answer it. -No... -Who is it? -How do I know? I'm here. Who is it? Tell me. A friend from the gym, I think. A friend from the gym at 3 in the morning? You think I came down with the last shower? Hey, rainman... we've only just started going out. Did you think I was a virgin? I'd no doubts there! -You wanna know who it is? -Yeah. -Yeah? -Yeah. He's someone I see occasionally, all right? "Someone I see occasionally"? All right... On you go, then. Go! Go and screw whoever the fuck you like, but get out of here! -Are you serious? -What the fuck are you laughing at? Yes, I'm serious! You think I'm mucking about? You're not normal. Listen to this! I'm not normal? Cos you are? You're going out with me and seeing someone else? Fuck off, Terry! You fuck off! What am I doin' with this troglodyte? Go and play football with your pals! I'd do better to be doing that! Definitely! On you go! -What a moron! -Get out! You really did come down with the last shower! I'm the moron, wasting my time! Get the fuck out of here! Dickhead! On you go, get out of here! Go and do whatever the fuck you like! Unbelievable... Sandro! Sandro... You seen Sandro? I've been looking for him all day. Me too. Tell him not to show his face. What happened? He just better not show up. Hey, guys. Angelo. I've been looking for Sandro all day. I called and he doesn't answer, I went to his house, he's not there. He's not at Americà's either. And? Nothing...they were all at Americano's, totally pissed off. What? Are we busted? No, no way. But they were armed. They must think it was Pechegno. What do we do now? I think we're still in time. We need to go there. -Where? -To Pechegno. Are you mad? They'll kill us. Angelo, it's done now. You should have thought of this sooner. All right, you stay here. I'll go on my own. Where are you going? Come here! Gabbiano's the hardest. I'll deal with Gabbiano, don't worry. I mean it...everyone in front, me and Nano at the back! Stop Pechegno, but don't touch him. I wanna split his skull. I'll hold him. Let's hurt them and not ourselves. So be careful! There he is. Guys... Hey, Barabba. Mohicano. Finish this. -You came on the bike? -Yeah. Put a scarf on, it'll be chilly on the bike. Guys, let's go. Well, dickhead? Why did you set fire to the banner? What banner? Why did you set fire to the banner? You piece of shit! I didn't set fire to any banner. What did you want to prove? That you've got balls? Yeah? Did you want to prove you've got balls? Yeah...? Arsehole! Don't move! Sandro! Arsehole! Arsehole...! Sandro! Stop, Barabba! Let's go! Go! Boys, out! Come on, guys, out of here! Sandro! -Sandro! -What d'you want? -Sandro! -What the fuck d'you want? -Stop! -What d'you want? We set fire to the banner. And you think I hadn't realised that? Eh? I wanted to tell you... What the fuck did you want tell me? That you're a little shit? Just like your dickhead of a brother! -Oh, Angiolè! -What happened? -What did they do to you? -Nothing. Oi, Sandro! Sandro! Oi, what the fuck happened? It's over, Barà! If this voice Wakes you up at night While you're holding Your husband tight Stay awake If you want to stay awake But pretend You're sound asleep Don't go to the window To take a peek That voice is mine You're right, it's no mistake The same voice I had back in the days When we were strangers And spoke nice and polite If this voice Crying in the night Wakes your husband Don't be afraid Because there are no names In my serenade Tell him to sleep And hat everything's all right Tell him "Whoever's singing down below Is dying of jealousy Or totally loco He'll be crying Over a betrayal or something He's singing alone But who knows why he's singing?" If this voice Sings to your heart, sweet dove The things I never sought from you Or told you All the torment Of a lost love All the love Of a past torment... What have you done? I don't know. It's like a book they've sent me. I don't even know what I'm supposed to have done, now we'll see. -Officer. -Good morning. And where's your pal this morning? Dunno. The risk is undervaluing today's game, thinking of next week... DAY 37 OF THE CHAMPIONSHIP -Where have you been? -At the stadium. -I called you six times. -My phone was dead. When I call, you need to answer me! Who's this dick? You need to answer. -What d'you want? -You're fuckin' selfish! What, now you give a shit about me? Angelo... love, what's happenin' to you? Are you not well? If you've got problems... anything at all... it's just me and you, OK? You wanna know what the problem is? The problem is my father doesn't exist. My brother's dead... and you've decided to be a mother, but you're not able. I'm sorry... Angelo... Angelo! -Stay... -Get out of my face! Angelo... Look, calm down... Get out of the way, you prick! Turkey breast, cured ham's good as well. Ah, OK, I prefer that, let's say... Yeah, you have to alternate, you can't always eat the same thing. Then for lunch, 50g of rice with a bit of chicken... ...banana shake, pomegranate. -Do you like pomegranate? -Hi, Terry. It's very good. Terry, stop, I need to talk to you. D'you know this guy? Come on, I need to tell you something. What? I wanted to apologise. -Are you done? -Yes. Fuck off, then. Here, Fiore. One game, guys. Just one more. And what happens if we win...? God! Naples'll come tumbling down. The world'll come tumbling down. Guys, we have to go to Rome. Chabbù, oi! Let's go, what are we doing here? Oi, guys, you go away! What d'you want? Chabbù, open up! We have to take the Via Cassia. It has to be. There's no checkpoints there. OK, Gabbiano, but have you seen how many we are? How can we go to Rome like this? Bro', if you're scared, stay home! Angelo, what's this racket? I need to talk to Gabbiano. Let me in. Talk to Gabbiano? No one can get in here, guys! -Let's go. -I have to tell him something! Do you realise what happened? So what? I have to talk to him, it's personal. Angelo, I don't want to hear a pin drop, nobody's to breathe. -Got it? -Don't worry. Otherwise you'll drop me in it with him! Get in, move! And if any of you don't want to come, go now. Get up and leave. Because I don't give a damn. But you have to tell me now! You have to get up and leave if you don't want to come. I've no problem, I'll go there alone. -Oh, Gabbiano... -What...? Look at this. Chabbù... who the fuck let these brats in here? Who? Come on, bro', they're on our side. Whose side, Chabbù? Whose? Get out of here, Chabbù. What? We wanna come to Rome. -What? -We wanna come to Rome. -Why d'you wanna come to Rome? -To avenge my brother. And how d'you wanna do that? We'll take blades and knives. -You got the balls to stab them? -Sure. Yeah? Yes, you got them? Yes. Is the fat guy coming as well? Come on... I can't believe it, come here. Can you imagine Lardarse in Rome stabbing people? What is it, Lardarse, you wanna fight with me? Yeah? Loser! Oh, what are you mad at? OK, you can come. But go away for now. Bye, Gabbiano, thanks. Idiot! You see? These kids have more balls than you! No? Terry, please, listen to me! I have to tell you something important! Shall we go to Ischia? No. You said you'd never been. These fuckin' keys, I can never find them... -Look, I've got the tickets! -No, Sandro, I don't wanna go. Come on, just a day trip! I said no. What the hell...? That's so sore... You're really stupid putting your foot there! I thought you saw it! That I saw it? Why don't you just leave? Bloody hell, I think it's broken. But how can it be broken for so little? I think it is. What is it? You're not stupid, you're an arsehole! Ouch! What...? What the fuck's that? What is it? What happened? What's this? -Pee. -What are you doing? It's to disinfect. Gross! Don't worry, it contains ammoniac! Get rid of this, it stinks! If I had a house here... Yes? ...what life would I have? At the beach till eight or nine at night. That's not another life. This is someone renting a house on Ischia. Another life...? What would I like? I'd like to be an astronaut. I'd go into space, the universe, to discover other worlds... It's another life! -What a pain! -A pain? I don't know, Terry, what other life I'd like. Definitely a quieter one. I want to risk it... A life beside you, OK? -A quiet life? -If you say so...! What side are you on? Come on! -Jump! -Go! Come here! -Where are we going, Terry? -This is abandoned. It's not opening, come on! What a view! Since I was a kid I've always wanted a house with a sea view. Don't! Gross! What are you doing? You not kissing me? You won't even kiss me? Now you kiss me. -Hi, Sandro. -Hey, Stefania. -Is Angelo here? -No. He hasn't been home for two days. Did he go to Rome? Stefania, I don't know if he went to Rome. And to be honest, I don't even wanna know. OK, I get it, forget it. Goodbye. Stefà... I tried my best with Angelo. He's all I have, Sandro. Bye. LAST DAY Let's burn the capital! Let's burn the capital...! Let's burn the capital! Oi, the cops are here! All together! Come on! Move! Come on, move! Come on, let's get to the Roma fans! Angelo, you OK? Let's get out of here! Come with me! Come with me. Let's get out of here. This way. Angelo! Oi, what the fuck are you doing here? Come here! Get him! Stop! Piece of shit! Angelo! Shitty little Neapolitan! Let's see if you come back to Rome! Oi, Sandro! Come on, let's go! Move! Run, Fiore!
