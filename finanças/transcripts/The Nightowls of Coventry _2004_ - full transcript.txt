That's what they said in the old country. And then look what happened. Marv, he's powerful, he's famous. Then he goes down. That's how life is. There's always been a neighborhood on Coventry Street. You had vegetable stands, bakeries, kosher chicken market. And for 28 years, you want a blintz and a cup of coffee? Marv's was the place to go. Only place after eight at night. But then one day the young kids moved in. The hippies come and they do their thing. The curious just watched, the pessimists Most of 'em were good. Some not so good, but what can I say? They were different. Yeah, that's it Fuck you and fuck this place! Just about every gal on Coventry Street had worked at Marv's. Sooner or later, they all walk away. What happened to Sally? Turnover was so high because well, Marv just couldn't stay away from the waitresses. Only Sylvia had stuck it out. Will you people ever see that uniform again? What do you want from me, Gracie? We needed help, I hired a waitress. I got your chickens. Ah. What are these for? These are for my new sandwich, the Miraculous Marvel, one bite of this thing and they're gonna line the streets. That's what you said about the dough maker. That was different. Don't listen to her. Take these to the kitchen and I'll give you a check. Mr. Grunfield said that I should only take cash. What? He said that your checks was only good for wiping your tuchus with. He said that about me? God damn trader. You know, if it wasn't for me, he wouldn't have a business. He'll still be picking How Marv stayed in business was a mystery. It seemed that whenever he made, he'd spend on the horses. For God sakes, Gracie, my old cousin. I gave him his start and this is how he treats me? You'll see. Tell your uncle I'll be giving him checks and I don't care what he does with 'em. So we're going up to her place. I should have known from the moment that I was on the stairway that I was in for an unusual evening. Then one thing leads to another, hanky panky, heavy pet, the clothes are coming off. There we are stark naked. You know what she says to me? Grunfield won't take Marv's checks. Nah, she says, Grunfield? What's Grunfield got to do with it? Where was I? Oh yeah, she says, I like to wrestle naked. Then before I have a chance to ask Oh, I forgot to mention, me, Morty and Yosha were Marv's steadiest customers. She's naked. What's that? It's for Marv. I didn't finish filling in the G. I ran out of green pen. Can't I ever finished a story around here without being interrupted? I wasn't interrupting. You asked me what it is. - What'd you charge him? - I gave him a bargain. Why do you let him penny pinch you like that? He's not penny pinching me. I just gave him a bargain. What do you think? What's that supposed to mean? You can't afford the lox, you're not welcome? That's a classism, man. He has to run a business. Oh, he's doing plenty of business. Look at him. All the food he shoves in his belly could feed a hundred starving children in Bangladesh. It doesn't matter what he puts in his belly. Grunfield won't take his checks anymore. That doesn't mean you have to let him penny pinch you like that. He's not penny pinching me. I just gave him a bargain. Oh, so you gave him a bargain and we sit here for an hour waiting for a lousy cup of coffee? That's how it is. First goes the coffee, then the corned beef, then they take away the business. Susan Bennett was new to Cleveland. Her first time away from home. It's a fast track so give me Hot Tamale in the fifth at Santa Anita. Give me Lefty in the third at Hialeah and Cleopatra in the third at Pimlico. A century note on each. You got that? Yeah. I wanted to see about getting a job here. Got any restaurant experience? The Dairy Barn. You good with people? I don't know. Yeah, I guess so. You went to school? College, I'm a freshman. Ah, college girl, huh? You know, all my kid brothers went to college, one of them is a doctor now. Head of gastro. Oh. So about the job? Yeah, sure, you can start tonight. She can't work in those clothes. You take care of it. The ceiling's leaking again. Do you have a skirt and a plain blouse? Well, it's almost plain. It'll do, just change and hurry back. Your shift started an hour ago. I don't believe this. Lenny re-plastered this last week. I let him eat here a whole week for free. It ain't the plaster that's your problem. It's the people upstairs. They got a swimming pool up there or something. Why don't you have Horowitz do something about this? He won't do anything. Maybe if you paid the rent he would. Why do you think I don't pay it? He never does anything. That does it. Why did you hire that girl? We needed somebody. But I'm supposed to do the hiring. So I hired her, you train her. - Hey. - Alright. How come he always has food? He knows how to behave himself. Hey, what about us, huh? Susan had an apartment right down the alley from Marv's with Faith, a girl she knew from back home. It must have been nice for Susan to have a friend in such a strange new place. Do you have a plain blouse? I'm working at Marv's. How about my white halter top? How about just going in your undies? Excuse me, what do you want me to do? If you had not taken your sweet old time coming back there would have been time to train. - I'm sorry. - See this pad? That's your station. Go take orders. What's up, man? I'm gonna take two bagels, extra jam. Make it strawberry jam. Is that everything? No, hold on. Hot beef tongue and eggs? Waitress! What's she doing over there, shooting craps? Do you want me to come back later? No, hold on a second. Okay, if you're getting beef tongue then I'm going to get blitzes. Okay, make it three blueberry blintzes, side of sour cream, make it two sides of sour cream. - Blueberry? - Blintzes. And don't forget the sour cream. Waitress, huh? How are you? Oh, I love these, this is your color. Do you believe in love at first sight or should I walk by again? You look great. I ordered a cheese blintz, not a blueberry blintz. I don't even eat blueberries, I'm allergic to 'em. Sorry, I'm not sure what happened. - Morty, shush. - Don't shush me! We've been waiting 40 minutes, she's trying to poison me with blueberries. No, you understand, there's no cheese. Waitress! I'm not paying that bill. Waitress! No, she had no cheese on the sandwich and you gotta fix this now. Sandwich, no cheese. Nice haircut, Sylvia. Those two pay in advance, that's the policy. But I just got here, how was I supposed to know? That's always been the policy. Well, Helen was as big as a Caterpillar tractor. She had muscles and moves like a cat, you know? So we're talking nice and soft, see, and she says would you like to come up to my place? Grunfield's Market was just down the block from Marv's. Best grocery chickens in Cleveland. And we are from the Coventry Friends Association. But not everyone was impressed. You've heard of us, yeah, we're a grassroots organization Brent's father was a famous judge and Brent wanted to follow in his footsteps. Rest of the neighborhood. I think that explains the jacket and the fancy hairstyle. Noticed a bit of a stench. It's the odor-An odor? You're here to complain about an odor? It's nothing personal, really, Mr. Grunfield Listen, you want to clean up some place, go see my cousin Marv five doors down. Good day. Hello, Manny. Benny, could you believe? These people come in and want me to clean up a chicken odor. - A chicken odor? - A chicken odor. They want to complain, they should complain on Marv, not me. He's the one stays open all night and brings all the cooks into the neighborhood. - He has to do business. - Some business. He begs me I should give him my best chickens at cost so he can make his farshtinkener sandwiches. And then you know what he does. He writes me two bad checks, two in a row! Pretty soon I don't have a business. Davis the baker, Sam the fish man, my own customers, they're gone. They all went up to the mall. The cooks keep coming, I'll have to go there too. There are chickens in the mall? Who knows, who knows? Hey, hey, whoa. You guys have to pay in advance if you want anything. What? You skipped out without paying last night. But we put the money right under this ashtray. And with a big old tip too, didn't we? Hey, can you fry these up for us? Alright! No, one a piece. What is it? The Marvel, corn beef, tongue, chicken breast, chopped liver, eggs, onion and kosher chicken shmaltz. Delicious, isn't it? Now I've seen 'em in China. I've seen 'em in India. I've seen 'em in France, even Japan, but never have I seen ones that were freckled. These were phenomenal. So before you can say Grunfield gave me a whole chicken today. Try one. I'm so hungry. You can have this back, Marv, thanks. Hey. Some guy in a dress is stealing my food. A guy in a dress? Excuse me, guys. Listen, Marv, you know I'm president of the Coventry Friends Association now? Well I have to tell you we have been receiving numerous complaints from the community about your operation and we've come up with a few suggestions. One is to limit your hours. - Limit my hours? - Yeah. You must be joking. No I tell you what, the coffee's on me. Oh, you can have another free Marvel. How about that? No, I don't want this, I'm trying to make a point, Marv. Everything's gonna be all right. - I don't want this. - Don't worry about it. Your pain kind of moving away? You're working too hard. Don't get jealous, I'll get to you later. There we are, feel it. You feel any better? Now speaking of someone who has tension in their body. - Turn around, turn around. - What are you doing? Oh relax, it's called a massage. Don't worry, it's fine. Tension, tension, tension. That's not good when you tense up like that. Susan, come on over, I have something for you. For me? Of course for you. Come, sit with us. Bring your books with you. And we get into conversation. So on this one occasion the next thing I know they're inviting me to dinner. Well, I can't turn that down because you know, a lot of those Italians cook. Then I begin to notice every time I'm there how Helen's chair is closer and closer to mine. - How about some coffee? - No thanks. How about a tea biscuit? They're very good. Thanks, I already ate. - I gotta go. - So soon? Yeah, I got a hair appointment. - Hope it comes out well. - Yeah. I painted this a few years ago from a magazine cover but it looks a lot like you. Yeah, I guess maybe, maybe in the eyes a little. You like it? Yeah, it's really great. Here. Thanks. It's always hard part that used to a new job. People are hard to get along with. Don't worry about it. You'll get used to 'em and they'll get used to you. I just don't think that Grace likes me. Marv. I don't think that she dislikes you. It's pretty hard for her to accept anybody, I think. She's worried about her own position. He really eats a lot. Yeah, well, he was in the camps. It's like when you're trying to make up for lost sleep. He's trying to make up for lost food. You just can't do it. What now? What? That waitress you hired has got to go. She doesn't do any work. Gracie, I'm trying to make something very special here and I keep getting interrupted. Maybe I'm the one that should leave. Gracie. Listen to this. I got plans for this place. Listen, I've had this idea, I'm gonna expand this place into a cocktail lounge. I'm going to have cocktail waitresses and we're gonna have them wear these costumes. What kind of costumes? Cocktail waitress costumes, nothing, something that's nice. Something fancy. Who's gonna hire them? Only one person, you. What about Ruth? Well, if this thing works, I'll have enough money to take care of her. I can get a divorce and then we can, Gracie, look at me. And then there'll just be the two of us. Okay. Oh, stay right here. Don't move. Don't move! Hold it up. What's this for? I wanted to wear it when we open the cocktail lounge. Hold it up. Oh my God. You look beautiful. You are so mm. Oh. What am I gonna do with you? I have to work. Alison, I love you! Go to hell, Doug. Hey, we're having a party at Cumberland Meadows tonight. No, it's true, man. Bring all your friends. Tonight at Cumberland Meadows. Man, I need a woman. Damn that house. Got any more wine? No money, no spirits, no food, no reefer. Man, how are we gonna have a party? Marv. He looked at me like I felt like somebody on the cover of a novel. He was so cute. I've seen him with some other girls but I'm not really sure if he has a steady girlfriend. There's only one way to find out. How? - Seduce him. - Seduce him? He doesn't even look at me. That's not surprising. What do you mean? You're like an open book. You're too honest. What's wrong with being honest? Guys don't like it. You've gotta act more mysterious. Like you don't care. Put on an act. I can't do that. Then some other girl will. Try these on. Not bad. Now you have to figure out what else you're going to wear. You didn't refill the ketchup bottles last night. I didn't know what was supposed to. I shouldn't have to tell you everything. Jesus, Gracie, you didn't have to snap at her like that. It's her first week. I suppose you like her or something. Gracie, please don't start. Horowitz called. He's giving us one week to catch up on all the rent or he's serving us with eviction papers. Horowitz is throwing Marv out of the building. Who told you that? I heard Grace talking. That woman is a worry wart. You know what she needs is a little. Morty, shush, we're in mixed company. A man worked hard all his life, then they put him out? That's how it is. You going somewhere special tonight or something? No. Well you're all dolled up. Morty, shush, let her study. Would you stop shushing me? Oh God Trotsky. Should call it history of western imperialism. I can't believe you actually pay to get brainwashed. I'm not paying, I got a scholarship. Smart gal, she got a scholarship. You know why you're studying this stuff? So I can do well on the exam? Why? I don't know. I just, I want to do well. She'll do well. She'll meet a nice man. He'll make good money. - Well, that's not exactly- - Money, money, money. It's all this corrupt society ever thinks about. What's wrong with a little capitalism? Man wants to sell me a tea biscuit, I like them so I buy it. Well it's not that you like them. But I do like them. No, you don't like them. You think you like them because the pigs of capitalism have brainwashed you. Now in a Marxist society You know I was at one of them Communist rallies once, some dame invited me. Boy, did she have a nice rack. I wasn't talking about the Communist party. I'm talking about Marxism. Some Russian gal, she told me she stood in long lines for hours just to buy a banana. They don't have bananas in Russia. Sure they do. They ship them in from Havana. I wasn't talking about bananas! Oops, I gotta go. What can I get for you? How about an iced tea and a bagel. Got to make that 75 cent minimum. Oh hi. Where you going? You, uh, Gracie tells me you're doing a great job. Really? Yeah, you got a way with people. Everybody likes you. Thanks. You know, if you keep this up, maybe, this is no promise but I could make you my head hostess. I don't really. Ooh, come on, baby! I better go. Where you going? I gotta get upstairs. Sure, okay. If you gotta go, you gotta go. Hey baby. I hit the jackpot tonight. You gonna let these roughnecks stay? Of course, they're paying customers. But I don't like the way they're treating the waitress. - They can handle it. - But Marv... I gotta do what's good for business. It's the deadbeats who sit here all night sipping coffee I gotta worry about it. Come back anytime, guys. Hey, Marv-man. What? What do you troublemakers want? We need to talk. Alright, you see, there's gonna be this, well, kind of an orgy tonight at Cumberland Meadows. - Orgy? - Yeah. There's gonna be a lot of girls there. Girls, huh? Well yeah and see the thing is we need to get these girls a little loosened up, you know? So I was hoping, you know, someone would do the catering. Well I'd like to, but I can't leave Gracie here alone to run the place, poor woman. Marianne said she'd be there. Oh and the new waitress, she has a crush on you, man. - Susan? - Yeah, Susan. She's kind of shy, but you know, all work and no play makes Marv a dull boy. Where'd you say this party was supposed to be? What are you doing? Catering a party. What party? Oh, some party, that's all. Oh, you'll need help, I should go with you. Gracie, if you come with me, who's gonna mind the store? It'll fall apart. So where is this party? Gracie, it's, I don't know. You're catering a party, you should know where it's at. I know where it is, It's in Shaker Heights somewhere. You're up to something. I'm up to something, all right. I'm up to working 24 hours a day, seven days a week. That's what I'm up to. I'm up to never having a day off, the one who's responsible for anything that goes wrong. I killed four rats last week. What rats? In the basement? I killed four of them. You didn't tell me about that? Well, how could I tell you? It's too disgusting. I killed them with a broom. Crushed them. Oh my God. I don't want to talk about it. Oh Marv, why didn't you tell me? Oh, it's all right, it's all right. I can't think of it now. I gotta get to the party. I'll wait for you. No, no, no, no, no, you need to go home. You work hard too. No, Marv, I wanna wait for you. Okay. I'll be back just as soon as I can. Alright! Thanks, Marv. So, where's Susan? Hold your horses, man. I thought you said Tommy would be here. I didn't say he would for sure. Well I better get going. Why don't you loosen up for once? Susan? Man, I am beat. I waited for you. We ran out of corned beef and chicken. Probably you took it with you for the catering. I called Grunfield at home. He said he wouldn't sell us any more chicken. Said he'd see you in court. - Gracie- - You weren't here and the customers were complaining so I thought maybe Gracie, don't be mad at me, Gracie. I am so, God, what am I doing? What am I doing in this place? Sometimes I think I'd just like to forget this. Forget everything. You have me, don't forget that. Dirty God damn queers. Stop! Oh shit! Come on! Want some? - Morty. - Hey. Got a headache? No, it's okay, I'm fine. Ever tried heat therapy? What is that? Here, take my hand and point it wherever the pain is the strongest. Go ahead. Pain still there? - Did it move? - A little. Well move my hand. How do you know this stuff? Well, I've had some training. Healers and Sherpas. They keep inviting me to dinner. I'm hungry, so I go. Then one day Helen's brother says to me he wants to have a man to man talk. Uh-oh, I know this spells trouble. 'Cause it has been my experience in this kind of matter. Nice gal, isn't she? Yeah, sure. So what do you do? I'm a healer. Oh, you're a doctor. No, I don't believe in the practices of the medical profession. I'm a natural-path. Sounds like fancy business. - You make good money? - Benny! Getting more and more clients every day. - What's your last name? - Blankenhorner. Hmm, never heard of it. Is that Slavic? No, actually. You're not her grandfather by any chance, are you? No, no, of course not. Sorry, I gotta get back to work. So you want to give me your phone number? Yeah, sure. So then he says, well, don't you like Helen? I say sure I like Helen. And then he says, well, don't you want to marry her? Then before I have a chance to answer, he says, you know being a kike won't bother her. I didn't know what I just said, I was speechless. You listening to me? Where you going, hey? Susan, I'm worried about you. What do you mean? Well, you're a very sweet girl. I don't want to see you get hurt. Benny, what are you talking about? That fella you were talking to. I really can't talk about this right now. But Susan. The Slavic fella, what was his name? - Tommy. - Waitress. Tommy, that's right. You should stay away from him. I can't talk about this right now. I wouldn't trust him. What do you know about him anyway? What's to know? Anybody can see. How about some fucking service? Look, would you just stop following me around? This is really none of your business anyway. Calm down, I don't wanna upset you. It's just that you've been here a while and you're a sweet girl and we worry about you, kind of like your family. Look, I came here to get away from my family. I don't need a whole new set of parents butting into my business. But we weren't butting into your business. We, we just Will you just leave me alone? Marv! Out. Get out of here. - What? - And don't come back. What, man, what? You think I'm stupid? Get out of here. - What? - Out! Out! Hey, you fucking pigs, what are you doing? Leave him alone, he didn't do nothing. Thank you, officers. Come back when you're through and I'll get you some sandwiches. Man, Marv's really in with the pigs. Well, maybe those dudes will finally wake up. Wake up is right, Marv's finally learning some common sense. I don't understand it. I've never seen him so angry before. - Well finally. - Bunch of fascists Oh yeah. Hey man, think I can crash here tonight? - Dee got thrown in jail and - Fuck that, man. Last time you were here, you stole my stash. You ought to be locked up with him. I was just borrowing it, man. Look, I'll bring you more plus double. Now way. Alison, you tell him. Hi. Come on in. You have a really nice place. This is where I treat my clients. But it doubles as a living room. Have a seat. Care for something? Sure. I've never actually tried that before. Never? Well isn't it supposed to be, you know, dangerous? Hey, it's good for you. It's therapeutic. It's just that I smoked something last night. This is the best stuff on the market. I would never give you anything funky. You can trust me. Just inhale real deep and hold it in your lungs. - You okay? - I'm fine. There you go. I don't feel anything. Patience, you will. Excuse me. Hey man. You think I could crash here tonight? I've been through some rough shit. Well. Sorry about that. What's on your mind? Nothing. Come on, sure there is. Well, it's just that I always see you with all these girls. They all seem to be crazy about you. I mean, I know I like you but why did you choose me? Because, you're special, that's why. I'm so hungry. You are? Well, better take care of that. Sweet or salty? - Definitely sweet. - Sweet, huh? Mm, yes. Oh no. Better go find it. What are you doing? I've got to find my grape. What are you staring at? Stop, just ignore him. Hey man, I asked you a question, you got a problem? No, I don't have a problem. Then what are you staring at? I wasn't staring at anything. Look, we don't want any trouble. We just wanna get something to eat, okay? Damn it! You know, it used to be my wife and I would fight like cats and dogs. I'd come here to get away. Now I come here and everyone's fighting like cats and dogs. This fucker doesn't like your beer. Marty, you gotta get rid of these scumbags. Who you calling a scumbag, fuckhole? He really didn't mean it. What do you mean I didn't mean it? Of course I meant it. - Calm down, calm down. - Look at me. - I want an apology. - Get him out of here. You'll take care of it, just like you take care of all the cockroaches, huh? How about a ride on my hog, baby? Look, I'll give you 10% off of all the things that you eat, okay? You and your girl. Look, you're not the only one with friends down at city hall, Marv. What are you doing? I wish I could lie here forever. Yeah, me too. Whoa, what time is it? Shit, I got a client coming soon. You gotta go. Oh, you know the landlord is supposed to be doing something about that. He keeps putting me off if you know what I mean. How about a piece of fresh German chocolate cake? You have a serious roach problem here, Mr. Bel-key. You know Alma, I've been in the deli business since I've been 12 and I've never seen a kitchen that didn't have a few problems. If you don't take care of these things in two weeks, I'll have to close you down. Gracie, dial up city hall and get me Mr. Kilmsy. Tell him Christmas is coming. What? Kilmsy's been retired. Huh? Get out of here! Marv, this is public property. We have a right to peacefully demonstrate. Out! Come on guys, keep singing. I can't believe it. He used to come here every night and I'd have Timbers make him an extra thick pastrami sandwich, and I mean extra thick, like that. You know, I'm the one who fed him through school. And then he turns around and stabs me in the back just because he's a lawyer now. He thinks he can tell me how to run my business. Who does he think he is? What happened? The pastrami steamer blew up. For Christ sakes, I just had it serviced. That was three years ago. Go to Schlo and Moe's and buy 20 pounds. There's no money. What do you mean no money? There's nothing left in petty cash. I looked at the books and we're in debt over $3,000. Don't pay the payroll tax. We haven't paid that in five months. Cancel the insurance. We canceled that last year. Marv, don't do it. Moish? Yeah, it's me. Give me a $200 on Fat Chance, fourth race at Santa Anita. - That's everything. - I feel lucky. That's what I said. $200, Fat Chance, fourth race, Santa Anita. 12 to one, you've lost your mind. I told ya, I feel lucky. Get me a corned beef on rye. I'm awfully sorry, Morty, but we're out of corned beef tonight. Well then get me a pastrami. We're out of that too. What? You going vegetarian or something? We have everything else. Isn't that nice, everything but pastrami and corned beef. Morty, just order. All right, give me a matzoh ball and give him a cheese blintz. Imagine running a deli without pastrami and corned beef. What'll be next, the pickles? It's not her fault the pastrami steamer blew up. Well, last week it was the ceiling. Before that it was the furnace. Frankly, I wouldn't mind if them communists did close Marv down. Where would you go? Schlo and Moe's. They close at eight. Alright then, I'll go what-cha-ma-call-it. - The saloon? - Yeah, the saloon. It burned down, don't you remember? That's just the problem. He knows he's the only place. He can serve dirt if he wanted and people would still come. Them communists, they can march and complain all they want, nothing will close down Marv's. He's got an empire. - Hi Mom. - Dougie. I was wondering if I could stay here for a couple days. - No, I don't think so. - Frank. Think you just ought to get out of here. I mean, just for a couple of days, I'll stay out of the way. Yeah, just like you stay out of the way when you're smoking marijuana, preaching free love, huh? Just like you stayed out of the way when John got his head blown off. Well I think you can just stay out of the way now. Frank. - Dougie. - Mom. Hey, Susan. Hi, look, I'm sorry to come by unannounced but I got locked out of my apartment. Hey, it's all right, come on in. Deville bunched with Fat Chance trailing the pack. Come on, come on, you imbecile. Heading for home, Lady Day looks to be winning. And here comes Fat Chance making the move. Middle of the stretch, Breeze, Lightning and Fat Chance. Fat Chance, Breeze, Lightning, they're neck and neck, stride for stride, they're coming to the What the fuck? Gracie! Of all the God damn things. Hi Benny. Nothing for me, thank you. Is it okay if I sit down? Why, you're soaking wet. There. Aren't you working tonight? It's my day off. What are you working on? It's nice. You think so? I couldn't decide between red and blue but I have some extra red pens I got on sale so I figured why not. Would you like a cup of coffee? Sure. How about a tea biscuit too? Okay, thanks. One way or a two way operation. Grace, where are the batteries? I needed them for the flashlight. Before he was reduced to giving Marv bargains he was a very famous illustrator. Now this here, this was his blue period, right Benny? Her ruby red lips parted invitingly. Kyle swept her into his arms and kissed her passionately. Her entire body pulsated, Benny, I can't believe you actually subscribe to this decadent trash. I didn't write it, I just did the illustrations. Man, the only reason they print this trash is to distract the masses from their real. Oh wow. Money, money, all this corrupt society ever thinks about. Look, every war, Vietnam Come on, keep reading. Hey guys, what's going on? Doug, hey man, where you been? How's Dee? - Pigs put them in jail, man. - Good. But they don't have anything on him. It turns out the pervert janitor just had a concussion. I keep telling you, man, pigs up their orders, keep the people down. You gonna eat that? Hey Timbers. Hey Timbers. I'm not supposed to serve you. Come on, man. Thanks. Where did you get these, huh? I had 'em with me. I'm tired of your games. Come on, come on, that was a long time ago. Just let me stay. Would you steal from your own home? I don't have a home, this is my home.

So Marv's luck was good for once and for a while everybody was happy. It was almost like being in a Broadway musical. But musicals don't last forever. It started when the protestors marched in. The roughnecks couldn't resist a fight. People began taking advantage of the situation. Brothers and sisters, the time has come, the time is ours! We will smash the capitalist god above!
