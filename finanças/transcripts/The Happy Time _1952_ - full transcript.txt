Never mind the gumdrops, Monsieur Lafayette. I have to hurry! Grandpere! (HUMMING) BIBI: Grandpere! What have you got, a canary? It is for you, Bibi. Happy Birthday. Merci. Hmm. This looks like the most wonderful bird in all of Canada. Does he sing? Only when he is in the mood. And when is he in the mood? Ah, when he sings, naturally. I wish he'd do it now. Oh, do not rush him. Birds are like women. You do not force the mood on them. One leads up to the moment gently. Timing's the thing, Bibi. In this case the timing was wrong? Ah, poof, there was nothing at stake. The sidewalk is no place to win a woman's favor or ask a bird to sing. When the moment is right, one does not need to ask, it is given. Oh, Robert, Robert! Can I see you a minute alone, Robert? Sure, I guess so. I'll be right in, Grandpere. Attendez... It's for you, for your birthday. Thank you. Put it on. Let me see how you look. Well, if it ain't young fancy-pants Bonnard! What's he doin' with your mask? I'm wearing it, tu comprends? Tu comprends. You gimme a pain! What's the idea? He ain't on our team. I only let you on 'cause you had a mask. Do you want it back? Me? I'm no Indian giver! Anyhow, it's his birthday and I want to give it to him. But I asked for it first. Ah, but Grandpere says when the moment is right, one does not need to ask. It is given! I, too, am in the mood to give. For this you deserve a medal. Hey! Au revoir. He gives me a pain. I think he's cute. Applesauce! Happy birthday, Bibi. Merci. Bonjour, Papa. Bonjour, mon Bibi. What have you got there? Grandpere gave it to me. A wonderful bird who sings only when he's in the mood. Oh! Well, obviously he does not sing for a living then. He is a true artist. Well, I hope he sings for you for many years, Bibi. I have also the ice skates you and maman gave me. Bonjour, Papa. A stuffed owl from Uncle Louis, a fine catcher's mask... Oh, Bibi, the postman left a large envelope for you. It's on the hall table. From your Uncle Desmonde. Uncle Desmonde? And how does it go with the new love? The Widow LaTouche? Oh, one makes progress. Last night it is discovered she wears a wig. Makes a difference? Well, no one is perfect. I agree. (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) Look, Maman, what Uncle Desmonde sent. A photograph of himself, and two nice ladies. SUSAN: Nice ladies! Jacques, will you look at this? Bibi, go up and wash your hands. They aren't dirty. At once! Well? You know what's on my mind. Show it to Grandpa. Too skinny. What do you suppose Bibi thinks of a thing like this? Thinks? He thinks nothing. He is only happy that Desmonde remembered his birthday. But these women! Who are they? And what are they? You know Bibi imitates all of you. He's even picked up Desmonde's trick with the medals! With the same results? Be still. Jacques, he'll realize what this is all about some day. Well, when he's old enough to realize he'll be old enough to understand. That Desmonde, he's becoming the most roving eye in Ottawa. With everything else, does he have to be a traveling salesman? I shudder to think what's happening to women all over Canada. Well, we have had no reports from the outlying provinces. Do not worry about Desmonde. One of these days he will change and settle down. It's a transformation devoutly to be wished. You quote? SUSAN: Shakespeare. Ah, there was an Englishman with glands. Be still. Bibi, what have you got on your sleeves? They're too long. Before he left town, Uncle Desmonde gave me some garters to hold them up. Women's garters! Take them off! Look at them! Off some stranger's legs! To Desmonde she was not a stranger. Jacques! Calm yourself, my love. My brother is young. Your son is younger. After all there's no great harm in catching garters that are thrown from the stage at the Casino Burlesque. It's done by some of our most distinguished citizens. It's a form of sport. I don't want garters from the Burlesque on my son's arms! Only one is from the Burlesque. The other was obtained privately. (GROANS) Now, Bibi, in the world of man, one does not talk too much, tu comprends? It is enough to have the garters, one does not volunteer the information where they were obtained. You will understand when you are a man. Papa. Hmm? When will that be? What? When will I be a man? Oh, soon enough. There is a law of nature called la Puberte and is widespread among all animals, being the awakening of a natural appetite. Life will taste better then. Like a good soup, ha, it is the seasoning that counts. Papa... But it's a hard appetite to satisfy, believe me. Please. (BIRD CHIRPING) Regard! He's in the mood! Ah! Magnificent, a perfect aria. Ah, in a moment you shall try your wings. Jacques, you're not going to let that bird out of his cage! Just for a few minutes. I want him to become familiar with our house. He won't fly away. Believe me, my love, this bird in his song, which I understand completely, has expressed a desire to live his own life. It is a desire that must be respected. How do you know what he wants, Papa? Your father, it seems, understands the language of birds. The first day we met, he told me that he had been speaking with a lark, who wished us to visit him in the woods. This is how it happened? This is how it began. And you, the bird's wish was granted. You went into the woods with him? Ah, you cannot be all Scotch. And you are even better than I thought. Ah. Eh. There we have it! Come, my little Caruso. That's good. Papa! The bird is gone! Oh, he'll be back. Don't worry. Maman, Papa! Look! You see? What did I tell you? BIBI: A piano! They're moving a piano in! A piano? For us? Name of a cow! Such idiots! They have delivered it too soon! What're you talking about? We didn't order a piano. It was supposed to be a surprise for Bibi, now they have spoiled that. A piano? For me? Merci, Papa, merci! They were told to bring it while Bibi and I were at the theater. What madness is this? You know Bibi can't play a note! It's a mechanical piano. He can play with his feet! You come too early. I said 2:00. You want us to take it back? No! Papa, don't let them do it! Well, make up your mind. All right, all right, get it into the house. I'll move the furniture out of the way. LOUIS: Bibi! Happy birthday. Hello, Uncle Louis. Did you get my present? Yes, thank you for the stuffed owl. Come over and see my piano! You can watch them moving it in! Very well. If there's no work involved. A piano is a heavy instrument. You use the word "work" as though you knew what it meant. The husband and the wife must not both work. All the world knows. And why not? It is a matter of la politesse. A man who drinks wine from a water cooler! A man who has not let the thought of work disturb his slumbers for 20 years! You lose so many chances to be quiet. A man who is even able to drink in his sleep! I've seen you! Ah, be still! You're a cork in my cognac! I must go now. You will listen to me first, do you hear? Arrange your ears and listen! You have a daughter, recall to yourself you have a daughter, an angel from heaven, a pearl among women. Oui, ma princesse... And yet this sweet child, this tender blossom, cannot get a husband! Pourquoi? Pourquoi? Pourquoi? Her father drinks wine from a water cooler! Calm your bile. Ah! Do not fret my golden pigeon, you will yet strike a man blind with your beauty. Name of a pig! Look, Uncle Louis, it's a mechanical piano, and has many rolls. Avalon, Tales From the Vienna Woods. Alouette, Whispering and, I wish I could Shimmy Like My Sister Kate. Why do men keep horses out of work? Oh, I must lie down. This sight has fatigued me. But you must come in, and listen to it play! I can listen out here. I shall strain my ears to the utmost, uh, but play softly. Softly. Whatever possessed you? Bibi wishes to have lessons. And it is for the whole family, tu comprends? It is good exercise for the legs. Jacques, how much did you pay for the piano? Uh, well, I have this friend, you understand, who, who wanted to get rid of it, because he bought a larger one. How much? Hmm? Oh, uh, $85. (PIANO JARRING) Jacques! Ah! You see, darling? Such a thing is not an extravagance! It's true that one should have money in the bank, but can a bank play Avalon? No? Oh, hello, Peggy, come in. I, uh, I just came to borrow something. Oh, of course. What is it, dear? The, uh, vacuum cleaner. Ours is broken. (APPLAUSE) Thank you. Thank you very much. Oh, I'll be late for my matinee. Come along, Bibi. I'll get my jacket. Are you going, too? I go to the Saturday matinee, with Papa. In honor of my birthday. Well, I, I guess I'd better go home. Don't forget the vacuum cleaner. Oh, yes, thank you, Mrs. Bonnard. Bibi, give me your comb. Turn around. Someday Peggy's going to run out of things she can think of to borrow. And she'll have to admit it's just an excuse to see Bibi. Me? Yes, you. A true Bonnard. You see, the women come to borrow his vacuum cleaner. Be nice to her, Bibi. She's an American and hasn't been in Canada long. She can't have many friends. She wears braces on her teeth. Bibi! Bonsoir, grand-pere. Come along, Bibi. We are late. Goodbye, sweetheart. (BIRD CHIRPING) (VIOLIN PLAYING) (APPLAUSE) (WHISTLES) (MUSIC PLAYING) I warn you, Gaspari, keep your hands to yourself! (APPLAUSE) (APPLAUSE) And now, ladies and gentlemen, for the first time on any stage in Ottawa I will attempt to perform a dangerous and mystifying experiment! This lovely young woman is about to be sawed in half! Music. (MUSIC STARTS) (MUSIC STOPS) (SUSPENSE MUSIC PLAYING) (SAWING) (APPLAUSE) My charming assistant appears lifeless. Let us see if we can detect signs of life, can she still be breathing? I shall listen closely and see. My poor, helpless pigeon. Take care, Gaspari! (LAUGHING) (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) (MUSIC STARTS) Come in. Are you sure I won't be in the way? Madame may object. Object? Object? No, she'll be delighted! But, uh, perhaps we'd better prepare her for the surprise, before she meets you. So if you'll wait here a moment. Come, Bibi. Yes, Monsieur. I know she'll be happy. Papa... I remember the time I brought the cat home and Maman made me take it back. Let us not consider failure, Bibi. We must handle this together, gently but firmly, tu comprends? Avec finesse. Hello, Susan. We're back, Maman! Well, I was beginning to wonder. Ah, it was a long matinee, wasn't it Bibi? You look tired, my love. Oh, oui, Maman, you work too hard. Well, it's no more than I've always done. And I enjoy it. Yes, but it is good to have leisure, too. Time to do other things. What other things? Well, you know, other things. The shoot the chutes at Luna Park. Oh, but I don't wish to shoot the chutes. Whatever gave you this idea? Well, it's because we have a surprise for you. She'll be a great help to you, Maman, and run errands, too. What on earth are you talking about? The maid we have engaged to help with the housework! You see, we are always thinking of you. A maid! And have we just inherited a million dollars? She's called Mignonette Chappuis. We saw her backstage after the show. She had lost her job. And she was crying. She was all alone, she had no place to go. But her job, what does she do? She is a magician. A magician? This is all I need! Oh, no, no, no. You misunderstand! She's with the magician! With! You know, uh, the beautiful one who stands at the side of the stage and cries et voila! And also hup! This makes all the difference. Ah, but you'll be delighted with her! I know she told me she was a magnificent cook and she has a strong desire to wash the dishes, mop the floors and dust the chairs, as well as make the beds and serve the meals! Et voila! Et voila! And when she serves the meals, will she make the dishes disappear and cry et voila? (BOTH LAUGHING) Jacques, how did she lose her job with this magician? Well, I'll tell you, Uh, Bibi, you'd better wash your hands before dinner. Why is it every time things get interesting my hands get dirty? Bibi, please. Allez, quickly, depeche-toi. So? Well, it is that, uh, with this magician, she provided certain services that we have described. But the magician, is a man whose hand is quicker than the eye, tu comprends? (PIANO PLAYING) So, today, no job, no money, she cries, I come by... Et voila! And also hup! Very well, Jacques, how soon will she arrive? Oh, she's already arrived. She's in the hall waiting. (CHUCKLES) Come, let's make her feel at home. Good. Mignonette, this... Bibi! Desist, please. This is Madame Bonnard. It's good of you to come to help me. But no! It's good of you to help me. You have a lovely house. Well, thank you. Bibi, will you show Mignonette up to the spare room? Take the bag, Bibi. It's a small room at the top of the house, but I think you'll find it comfortable. Merci bien. Well that's settled. Wait a minute, Jacques! Yes? What about your brother Desmonde. What about Desmonde? The Casanova of Canada, this girl is young and pretty... (LAUGHING) Name of a green sheep! He's not going to molest her. After all, he's not a devil. Besides, he's on the road, selling his wines, and will not be back for months. Now darling, please, don't worry about the entire female population of Canada. LOUIS: No, no more! FELICE: You will hear it again and again. You are a walking wine keg! You drink like a hole! Don't be so fancy! The King is not your cousin! Give me that! Take care! The mustard is rising in my nose! Regard yourself, drunk! Dirty! While your only child becomes an old maid! Give me... Do not tempt me to break your arm! Take care, this is war! Listen to me, you will become sober. Before you can set foot again in this house, you will become sober. Good, let's fix it that way. Jacques, what will the neighbors think? Why worry about the neighbors? These are the neighbors! She stole this from me. Imagine to yourself a wife who steals! It's against nature, n'est-ce pas? Is anything wrong, Madame Bonnard? Don't worry, my dear, you get used to it in time. Monsieur Bonnard's brother, Mignonette Chappius. Mademoiselle. Come, Mignonette, there are things on the stove and I want you to see the kitchen. Are you all settled? Do you think you'll be comfortable? Ah, yes, my room it is beautiful! The house and all of you are wonderful. You've made me so happy. We're glad you're here. Are you, Bibi? SUSAN: Oh, Mignonette! Oui, Madame Bonnard. I, uh, I brought your mother's vacuum cleaner back. I borrowed it. Who's that lady with your mother? She an aunt of yours, or something? Well, I was watching. I saw her kiss you, and she's pretty old. Oh, she must be some kind of relative if she kissed you. Well, I just thought I'd tell you I brought your mother's vacuum cleaner back. I thought you might want to know. Boy! What? What did you say? Say, those band on your teeth hurt? (GRUNTS) You, mon frere. I'm a burden on you, eh? I'm your black beast. Certainly not. You are my brother, of whom one can boast... "He drinks wine from a water cooler." That's something few people can say. I made only one mistake, I married a woman who wanted a career. Felice? She wanted this career? Dressmaking? She demanded it! And I, a man of promise, huh, was forced to retire. And dream. Never marry a woman with a career. She'll walk on your feet all your life. I'll try to remember. You are welcome here, Louis. Just close your eyes and let the storm pass. You're a brother worth keeping. (HONKS) Hello, my brother! The wandering fox returns. Name of a million names! Desmonde, it cannot be! Are you taken by surprise? Surprise? Surprise is not the word! You should be on the road, selling! No, you are confused. Now how can I be on the road when I'm here? Oh, Jacque, give me a hand with the other suitcase in the car. Hello, Louis. Desmonde, you are home? I am home, but you, my red-nosed brother, you are once again the traveler, eh? (LAUGHING) Let us celebrate with the best wines sold in Canada, compliments of my company! Oh! Uncle Desmonde! Bibi! (LAUGHING) Your trip, Uncle Desmonde, were there many adventures? Well, you know, Bibi, where Desmonde's horse has tread no grass will grow. I do not understand, what are you doing in Ottawa? Have you lost your job? No, the sales manager lost his. Uh, Bibi, bring us some glasses. What do you mean? Yes, he's dead, he has unscrewed his billiard table, so the office sent for me. To offer you the job? Office and a secretary. And you said yes? No, I said no. I'm not a rich man. You said no, why? You should see the secretary. Oh, Desmonde! You cannot be serious! My dear brother, I like to travel, I have no desire to settle down. So, I said I would stay here in Ottawa until they find another sales manager, and then poof! I'm gone again! Thank you. Mes freres, a votre bonne sante! The clan is gathered. Desmonde, you don't need wine. You are a tonic to yourself. Well, see you at dinner. Oh, I almost forgot. Look! A jewel! (WHISTLES) The finest garter on the stage today! Say that's the cat's whiskers! The garter of Mademoiselle Fifi Sonya y Martinez LaRue of the Casino Burlesque in Montreal! (LAUGHS) This is one for my collection, Bibi! Now let me demonstrate how I fought for, and won, this gem of the burlesque. Move over. Now, watch carefully, it was a hard fight. Now, we are at the Casino Burlesque. You're the man sitting next to me. He's an old hand at this game, an expert in the art. He has a bigger cane with a silver band on it, but I have the quicker eye. We are evenly matched. Now observe. Mademoiselle Fifi prepares to throw the garter! The drums roll! The trumpets blow! I, you will observe, have brought my cane to the thrusting position! And now, she throws it! I have it! I have it! (LAUGHING) Go back to your water cooler. This is not how it happened? This is not how it happened! Oh, Desmonde! DESMONDE: Allo, my old goat. So, Desmonde, you have not yet been shot by an unhappy husband? What's the occasion this time, uh? The Widow Latouche is waiting. I'm late. Oh-ho... It will unscrew your billiard table! Believe me, not even a young man can go out every night dancing and never sleep. Something will collapse. Maybe the arteries or the veins. The one who knows of a better way to die, will be step forward. Well, I'm off gentlemen! Someday, you will see, our father will be coming home from one of these capers and suddenly... (WHISTLES) First the doctor, then the priest! Ah, well, he is right, the one who knows of a better way. I'll help you unpack, Uncle Desmonde. You will, indeed. We have a maid now, named Mignonette. Oh, really. To help Maman. She was a magician with the vaudeville show. Oh. With, you understand, with! She said et voila! And also hup! Name of a golden pigeon! (CLEARS THROAT) I'm Desmonde, the brother. There are many brothers. Madame's in the kitchen. Oh, dear! Uh, allow me. Oh, your stockings are soaked! (CLICKS TONGUE) Name of a dark blue pig! Desmonde! Hello Susan, you're looking well. It is nothing, Madame Bonnard, an accident. I'll go up and change. The accident is your being here. You couldn't have come at a worse time. To the contrary, the timing seems perfect. But what about your job? Desmonde! Desmonde! Now, first things first, Susan, I will explain everything to you later. (WHISTLES) Regardez! I've hung up the new garter! DESMONDE: Superb. Do you have card for this one? Uh, the card can wait. I have more important things on my mind at the moment. Uh, Bibi, uh, La Gay Paree. Do you wish it? Oh, merci, Uncle Desmonde. I'll take it to school and trade it for baseball pictures. It's very popular, but only with the boys. Uh, I have observed that myself. (DOOR UNLOCKS) Uh, I understand you were with the vaudeville. Uh, you like to travel, hmm? No, I don't. So, I love it. The spirit of adventure. I am not adventurous. Oh, but you are or you wouldn't be living in this house. It takes a great courage to live here, believe me. Uh, especially when, uh, when Saint Louis of the water cooler arrives and all the brothers Bonnard together. Uh, have you met Grandpere? Ah, there's the white wolf to beware. Oh, wait! Now, I'm going to give you a token for your great courage and daring to live here. A medal. No! Name of a green sheep! Well! Papa, I think I would like a pair of long pants! (KIDS PLAYING) The governor general enters the Senate chamber and seats himself on the throne chair, his lady beside him. Uh, the Speaker of the Commons, with the members of the Lower House, stands outside an elaborate wooden fence the bar of the Senate at the opposite end of the chamber. And now, from the throne, chair, the Governor, General reads La Gay Paree! (KIDS LAUGHING) The Governor, General reads what from the throne? What did I say? (KIDS LAUGHING) Quiet! You obviously have not got your mind on what you are saying, Robert! (BELL RINGS) The homework for tomorrow will be an essay on the Canadian Parliament at Ottawa. Class dismissed. Hey, give me back my magazine. I saw you take it! Don't you want to trade? I got a swell bunch of baseball pictures! Give it back to me, I said! I'm in a hurry. Hey! Hot ziggity! This one's a lulu! I told you I didn't want to trade, will you give it back to me? Ah, you give me pain. Robert Bonnard! What have you been doing out here? Fighting, I'm sure of it! It's nothing, Miss Tate. I tripped... That magazine! Let me see it. Give it to me this instant! Follow me, this is a matter for Mr. Frye to look into. Proceed, Miss Tate, do not spare yourself when investigating the origin of wickedness. Then I found him fighting in the hall, with that magazine in his possession. Dirty, dirty, dirty! Contamination all around us! And now it's seeping into my school! Miss Tate, we must practice greater vigilance against the agencies of evil. As for you, young man, if I were not given to excessive leniency, I would throw mercy to the winds and punish you severely! Don't let this ever happen again, I trust you will heed the warning! Yes, sir. Very well, you may go. Robert, what happened? I can't tell you. I'm late. Late for what? Monsieur Lafayette! Has she been in yet? Who? Mignonette! The one I help with the shopping every day! Have I missed her? Oh, that one. No, I have not seen her, Bibi. Here. (LAUGHING) Mignonette! Mignonette! Mignonette! What's wrong, why aren't you shopping today? Because today I go to the movies. It is my day off. I forgot! Last Thursday you were off, too! I played baseball. What movie are you going to see, Mignonette? The one with Rudolph Valentino. But that's playing at Papa's theater! If I go with you, I can get us in for nothing! Absolutely free! That would be wonderful, Bibi! (MUSIC PLAYING) Ah, that Valentino, he is so handsome. Even his horse is handsome. And all that... Look, there's Grandpere. Oh, something is wrong! Papa, what's the matter? What happened? Are you all right? Ah, go away. Leave me alone! I'm only resting. Resting? You've brown your fuses! Come on. Put me down! Bibi, run to the corner! Get the doctor! I will not be carried through the streets like a roulade of beef! Is this respect for your father? Susan! Put me down. Deposit me! Stop it! Or I will deposit you on the floor! Louis, get some water! I've sent Bibi for Doctor Marchaud. Oh, that quack, he's no better than a hyena! Louis, cognac! Be still! Where is that water? Oh, water? I don't need a bath! I need a drink! I'll get the water. Louis, I said cognac! Ah, shh. Ohh. You're paying for the pots you have broken, my old goat. My hat! Give me back my hat! I'm losing patience, tu comprends? Where were you last night? And all day today? None of your business! The Widow La Touche. Oui, first the doctor, then the priest. Ahh. Here's doctor Marchaud. Good afternoon. Good afternoon, Doctor. Get out! I've not sent for you! I am here, just the same. So! We have a man with lead in his wings, huh? Ah, take care, I've never liked your face! Uh, go! Uh-uh, Papa, please. Lie down! Jacques, here's the glass of water. Quiet! My father is dying. I've warned you before, it's bad enough for a young man to burn the candle at both ends, but with you there's nothing but the wick. And that's burned out. (SOFT GRUNT) A man stumbles in the street, and then! The vultures gather! The pulse is like a roller coaster at Luna Park. Open his shirt. Oh, must I endure this? I'm not a public display. No, you're a public nuisance. Now, I would like to hear you breathe. I will try to oblige. (BREATHING HEAVILY) (BLOWS) The heart beats? If you can call that beating. By the rules he is dead. I will live to drink wine at your funeral! Let us not sprain the truth. This old spider has spun his web. If you wish to save him, he must go on a diet, do you understand? Oh, we'll follow your instructions. I guarantee that. Very well. This diet will consist of wet toast, uh, warm milk... (GROANS) And on rare occasions, a mushed egg, barely cooked. Better to die. That is a matter of taste. My fee is $4. All right. No, don't pay nothing! Nothing! Give him nothing! I had better tell Madame we'll be here for dinner. I do not think we should go out tonight, Desmonde. Yes, maybe it's better this way. Uh, what way? You have an engagement? Yes, to go dancing, but there are other nights. Come on relax. No, I will not. Unless you promise to keep your plan! A Bonnard never disappoints a pretty girl! You'll take her dancing, I insist on it! As you say. Now will you lie down? Only if it is agreed. Oui, it is agreed. (SOFT MUSIC PLAYING) You dance well, but Valentino, there's a dancer. Valentino! Valentino! That's all you've been talking about. He's my rival. Well, before the night is over I'll make you forget him. Oh, no, Desmonde, we must be getting back now. Uh, it's still early. We really must. Very well. Uh, garcon, l'addition, s'il vous plait. Bien, Monsieur. Please, Desmonde. But why? Now, must you jump every time I touch you? I wish to know why. Desmonde, let's be honest, we live in different worlds. Yours is a world of hotels and travel, living in suitcases. And do you carry a mansion around on your back? No, but I have lived in suitcases, too. All my life with traveling shows, until my parents died, then more of it in vaudeville on my own, until I came to live at your brother's house. Believe me, I'm never going back to this other world, the world you love. I've had enough of it! Aha! So this is the eel under the rock, hmm? You make it sound like I will never change. Desmonde, you live for the moment only. That's not true. It is true. But this should not bother you. It is your life to live as you choose, and no one is trying to change it, least of all I. So you travel, and collect garters, and see the world, your world, your world, while I dream of different things. There's no harm in it for either of us. But there's no future, either. Do we understand each other? My poor dove. So you have everything figured out, haven't you? All wrong! Now how such a sensible and beautiful girl can be such a sorry judge of character astonished me, really. So, you think I'm a rogue, don't you? If I said yes, it would only flatter you. Very well, very well. We shan't deny that, but did it ever occur to you that a rogue has dreams, too? Here is my dream. I want you to see this. Uh, my father, you understand, owns this house. Up the Gatineau by the edge of the river. Then why doesn't he live in it? Because he has come to live with us now. But he has promised it to me when I settle down. You like it? Ah, it is very beautiful. You're lucky to have it. You see, here, where my finger is, are the woods. And here, eh, behind the house, are the apple trees. They're white with blossoms in the Spring. So much ground. It's lovely. A lot for one man to take care of. Oh, uh, but I would not be there alone. There will be help, someone to share the joy with, I assure you. I don't believe you'll have any trouble finding someone, Desmonde. There are a lot of women in Canada, and you seem to have met most of them. Of course, but did it ever occur to you that I might have been searching for something, too? It is at least an explanation, even if I don't believe it. But, you believe in the house. Yes, I want to believe. Then, don't you see? Our dreams are the same. The check, Monsieur. So I notice. And the house up the Gatineau, is it nice, like this? But there is no comparison. You will adore it, it's... Shh. (DOOR OPENS) Well, what have we here? A man who walks in his sleep? Oh, Desmonde, it's you! I've had a narrow escape, believe me. So? There was a butterfly watching me on the porch. This again, but are you sure this time, Louis? Positive. Ready to spring. Oh, Mademoiselle, to a man in my condition, the bite of a butterfly can be fatal. But I don't believe it. A butterfly is harmless. Who knows? A kiss is harmless, too, but to you it is fatal. I do not believe that, either. Don't, Desmonde! It is very late. I warn you, even I can run out of patience. Goodnight, Desmonde. Another time, perhaps. (SOFTLY) Sooner than you think. (SOFT THUD) What's the matter, Uncle Louis? This. If I didn't know myself so well. I would swear there was a leak in here. A dry well is a ghastly thing, Bibi. Let me fill it for you. Bien. (INHALES) No wonder men go mad in the desert. In the movies, the desert looks pretty good. I saw Rudolph Valentino today. He enjoyed it. Then he must've had a bottle hidden in the sand someplace. I'm sure of it. Ooh. There's a boy with talent. Uncle Louis, when Rudolph Valentino kissed this girl. Something happened to her. I don't see how he could kiss her at all if he was thirsty. But he did. Several times he kissed her, each time she seemed to like it more. Oui, there can be magic in a kiss. It can change a man's whole life. Ah, this I already know! But can a kiss change a woman's life? I think this would depend on how she was kissed. This Rudolph Valentino is irresistible, because there is love in his heart... Tu comprends, Bibi? I see. And only then this kiss have magic. This is very interesting, Uncle Louis. Very interesting. (KISSES) (COUGHS) How's that lady that works at your house? What's the idea? What's the matter, Robert? Good morning, Miss Tate. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) Hey. Psst. (LAUGHING) Psst, hey! (GIGGLES) Class, settle down! Monitors, rise! Collect homework! Robert Bonnard! Define a fundamental theorem in plane geometry! Well, Robert? What are you waiting for? Eh, the square of the hypotenuse. Equals the sum of the square. Oh, Mr. Frye! Class, attention. Good morning, Mr. Frye. MR. FRYE: Good morning, Miss Tate. How are all your pupils today? No further problems in deportment, I trust. None whatsoever, Mr. Frye. Good. (CLEARS THROAT) Then I'd like to hear them recite. Class, be seated. Well, I see you have a young acrobat in your class, Miss Tate. Yes. Unfortunately it is Robert Bonnard. Ah, yes, the lad with the magazine. What were you trying to do, Robert? I thought perhaps I'd forgotten to sign my homework, Mr. Frye. Well, we shall see if you did. Robert Bonnard's homework! (GASPS) Did you do this? No, sir. I demand the truth! Is this your work? No, sir, I didn't do it, Mr. Frye. That is the truth! That is not the truth, but we'll find the truth. Which of you saw him draw this? Young lady, did you see him? Well? Answer me, did you? Yes sir. I saw him draw it! So, now we have the truth! Follow me! You are an evil, wicked, obstinate boy, but I shall at least teach you that there is no substitute for the truth! I have been lenient beyond reason! But I want the truth! And I shall get the truth! For the last time I put it to you. Did you draw that filthy picture? No, sir, Mr. Frye, I told... You insolent, lying rascal! Hold out your hand! The truth! The truth! The truth! Now then, Robert Bonnard, you will come to this office every single day, and every single day I will beat you until you confess and tell the truth! You may go! LOUIS: Ah, Bibi! Laugh, sing, rejoice! There is good news, I am home and my daughter, Yvonne, has obtained a lover who wishes to make marriage with her! That's very good, Uncle Louis. He comes now, the fiancee of Yvonne's, to ask permission to make the marriage. Any moment he comes, and I need special wine in his honor! Go and fetch me two bottles of your father's finest! Very well, Uncle Louis, I'll get them for you. Oh, this of Alfred must go well! I am so nervous as a fish on Friday. But do not worry, my dear, at last you are getting a husband, I promise you! What are you doing in here? This is one day I do not wish to hear the clatter of your tongue! FELICE: Name of a green pig! Look at your tie! Very well, then, fix it! But rest your mouth! I warn you, your daughter's happiness is at stake today! Don't you think I know that? Now I do not wish women in the room when Alfred comes, it is understood? You will remain in the kitchen. Calm your bile! You are not yet the father-in-law! And in the name of heaven, do not breathe on Alfred! You still rock from that cheap wine! Be quiet, a better grade is on the way. I've sent Bibi to get it. You sent for wine? Naturellamente, only the best for Alfred. Idiot! Arrange your ears and listen! Alfred does not drink! Tu comprends? He has never touched a drop in his life! A man who does not drink wine? He does not drink. This is hard cheese to swallow! You will swallow it, but you will swallow no more wine today! If Alfred discovers Yvonne's father drinks wine from a water cooler... All is lost! Name of a dog! Do not tell me my business. I'll handle this Alfred like a diplomat. With or without wine. Go, both of you, into the kitchen. You will learn who makes the weather in this family. (DOOR OPENS) Here's the wine, Uncle Louis. Oh, I have had a great shock, Bibi, it seems this fiancee of Yvonne's, this Alfred, suffers from a grave illness. He's sick? Oui, he is opposed to wine. Ah, magnifique! A good vintage. (CHUCKLES) What a pity! A man who does not drink! Well, that's the way it is with some bankers, you know. I didn't tell you, Bibi, this Alfred, uh, was a banker, huh? Ah, oui. He is, I believe, the president of the largest bank in Ottawa. At least one. It wouldn't surprise me if it were discovered he also controls banks in Montreal and throughout the Canada. (CORK POPS) Hmm... You've met him before? No, but the great moment is at hand. At last we shall meet! Hmm. What a vintage. He comes here now, the fiancee, to speak to me. To me he comes, Bibi. Not to Felice, to me. I offer a seat, he sits. We speak of the world, the position of the pound sterling. He explains to me, with care, his great wealth, his high social position. I listen. I ask questions. I examine closely. For it is I, the father, who must approve this marriage. If I do approve, he is gone! (DOOR BELL RINGS) The bell! He's here! Quick, the bottles! Uncle Louis! You forgot your shoes! Sacrebleu! Let him in! I must get my shoes! I am Alfred Grattin. Come in, please. Thank you. It's a hot day, very hot. Make yourself at home. My uncle will be right down. Merci, merci. Bien. (CLEARS THROAT) Monsieur Bonnard? I have a great thirst and have helped myself to the water. Water? You don't want that water! There's fresh water in the kitchen! Please! This water is fresh enough. It's just that the pipes are a little rusty. Eh bien... Monsieur, I am filled with love for your daughter. I wish to discuss the matter from every side. We must be very thorough. Of course, uh, proceed, I'm the father. I work in a bank, you know? All the world knows. International trade. What is the situation of the Swiss gold francs? What do you think of Canadian Pacific Rall... One bank? One bank. Monsieur, it is permitted? As I was explaining, in this bank I add up the checks, also the coins. The pound sterling, perhaps? (CHUCKLES) Is it expected to rise? The pound sterling? I know nothing of this. I'm a simple clerk. A clerk? Oui. A clerk. I am unbuttoned! This is another pair of sleeves! How can a clerk afford automobiles, jewels, rare cheese, trips abroad? Yvonne does not wish such things. Simple things much better, small house, flowers, many babies. Many babies? How can a clerk in a small bank give her many babies? It's not the bank that counts in these cases, Monsieur. I don't like this kind of music. The salary, what is it? Fifteen dollars a week, small increases each year, until it reaches twenty-two. There it is stabilized. Stabilized? At twenty-two dollars? It does not rise beyond this? This is minus insurance, also deductions for employees, the sick fund and my mother's allowance, which brings it back to $15.28 by the time I'm 40. You're back where you started! Well, a man's expenses increase with advancement, Monsieur. Think of your children! One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. They must be fed, they must have clothes, they'll grow up, they go to University. Why, I'm not so sure of that. The best. McGill, perhaps? Toronto? Queens? Good! But tell me, mon ami, how do you intend to send seven children to the University on $22 a week? Stabilized? I'll not send them to the University. It's time they went to work! (TAPS ON TABLE) Work? My grandchildren work? Tell me, mon ami, why did you have these children if you cannot afford to bring them up? It's too big a load for a man to carry. I'll not spend another cent on their education! But what have you done all these years with your money? Do you spend your nights gambling, but your poor wife, now pale and thin, waits at home alone? How alone? She has seven children! They're at the University! No! They are out earning a living for their poor old papa who has slaved all his life in the bank! (CRASHING) These are my children! These are my grandchildren! Sacrebleu! They must have an education! Monsieur! I am the father! I will decide! Speak one more word and I'll have no children at all! No children? None. Not one! What has happened? Louise, what have you done to Alfred? He refuses to have children! And he will not send them to the University! Alfred, come back! Tell us what has happened! Leave me alone! I don't need any of you! I'll have my children myself, and they'll go to work! Watch out! Well, are you satisfied? You have destroyed the happiness of your only daughter! There goes her best chance! Do you understand? Her best chance! It's the father's duty, to speak with the suitor. Bah! There are no suitors! And until you find one, you cannot step foot in this house again! Don't worry, Uncle Louis, I'm your friend. Ah, Bibi, it's good to hear someone say it. Do you think we should go looking for Alfred, and make him come back? Not even the Royal mounted Police could find Alfred now. Well, Louis? This time I have to put my finger in my eye. I've destroyed the happiness of my daughter. Oh, don't believe that. If the young man loves Yvonne, he will come back, when he becomes sober. If he doesn't, it's well you frightened him away. Name of a pig. He was drunk! JACQUES: It's all for the best, a blessing in disguise. (DOOR CLOSING) Oh, I thought it was someone else. I'm sorry to disappoint you. But he should be along any minute now. As a matter of fact, Desmonde usually gets home ahead of me. Hello, sweetheart. She blushes. That's a bad sign, eh? That's enough, Jacques. Your brother's changed very much recently. I'm glad. Well, in that case, I'm glad, too. If his intentions are serious, I will be very happy. He's already shown me a picture of his house. It's charming. What house? The house on the Gatineau, with the apple trees. You know, your father's house. Your father's house? That Desmonde! There's a broken string on my violin. I think... Wait, Monsieur Bonnard, is there such a house? Well, you know Desmonde, I'm sure he has something in mind. Yes, I know Desmonde! But I am luckier than the others. What others? The others who believed him. That picture was well worn. Thank you for letting me know. But I didn't say anything else. It's not necessary to say anymore. It is all very clear, a man who collects garters as well as hearts. My dear, we're sorry. We'll speak to Desmonde. And when you do, Madame, tell him to stay in his own room at night! Jacques, this is serious. What are you going to do about it? I'm very surprised at Desmonde. This doesn't sound like him at all. It's not just that, it's all the men in this house. Desmonde and Louis and your father. They're not good for Bibi. Bibi? What does Bibi have to do with this? He's growing up! He can't watch these men do the things they do around here and not be affected. But darling, these men are not evil! One drinks, another is young and looks for girls, another is old and, uh, looks for girls. Well, there's no harm in it for Bibi! Uh, that he sees them does not mean that he will imitate them! Jacques, you're fooling with your child's life. And if anything happens to him, I'll never forgive you! As long as I live! Susan, please. Susan, wait. Look! It is Rudolph Valentino! Ah, fly with me, fly with me, into another dawn! A name of a name! What was that for? Now, Mignonette... Last night the water, I thought you were being playful! But this is too much! I demand an explanation! (DOOR SLAMS) Name of a name! Now why should a woman come off the hinges like that? Now Bibi, please... (PIANO STOPS PLAYING) Can we dispense with the music? Thank you. Ah, the mood in this house is contagious, Bibi, but don't let it get you down. (CRYING) I won't go back to school! I'll never go back to school! I didn't do it! It isn't fair! Why do I have to tell lies to escape a beating? What, what, what has happened? What is this about school? Maman! Who beat you? SUSAN: Beating? What beating? Come on, Bibi. Now please, stop crying and tell, tell us what happened. Now what is this of a beating? (CRYING) In school, the principal finds a dirty picture. It's form La Gay Paree, which I have taken there. Ah! Now, now, wait! There are not dirty pictures in La Gay Paree. There are, it is true, pictures of women with few clothes, but this is not dirty! No, no! But this is only the beginning. It's a picture of a girl standing like so. Jacques! This is not dirty. But in this picture, on the head, instead of the face of the girl in the magazine, there's drawn the face of Miss Tate, my teacher. This is indelicato, but it is still not dirty. But also, with the pencil, many things have been added. This could be dirty. I've had enough now, do you understand? Well, are you satisfied? It's not Uncle Desmonde's fault. Only Peggy O'Hare's. When the principal asks her if I drew the picture, she says yes, I drew it. It's a lie! I didn't draw it! But why would Peggy tell a lie like that about you? I don't understand. She kicks me, she trips me, she spilled ink on my book! Why does she do this to me? Ah-ha. Oh-ho. JACQUES: Oh-ho. But why? Well, Bibi, it is that Peggy wishes to be your girl. My girl! Look, black and blue! Dull, it is how American women show affection. I have been in Detroit. But, the beating, tell us about the beating. The principal says that every day I must come to him, and every day he'll beat me with a strap. What? Until I tell the truth. Now Bibi, look at me. You did not draw the picture? No, Papa. Then listen to me, the truth has many forms, tu comprends? But when a man says my truth must be, I will beat you with a strap for the sake of my truth, this is evil. This we must fight, with every weapon, Bibi. My brother's, it seems there is a man at school who is looking for the truth. Shall we go and help him find it? Yes, I have a strong desire to clean the blackboards, with whatever I find. Let us shake up his fleas. You see how it is, Bib, when one is hurt, all are hurt. This is for all time! Allons! Allons! Allons. Now you will see, Bibi, what it is to be a Bonnard. We go to avenge the honor of the family! De l'audace! De l'audace! Et toujours de l'audace! Yes? Monsieur, I am Jacques Bonnard, a lover of truth, and also a father. I have a son called Bibi. You recall him? Bibi? Robert. Robert, Robert Bonnard! Oh, yes, the boy who drew that dirty picture. I know why you're here, gentlemen, but you're wasting your time. He was deservedly punished for something he did. You believe this? Not a matter of believe, it's true. And now if you'll excuse me, I was just on the point of going home. Uh, we would like you to stay for a while and talk. About what? The truth! Don't you try to intimidate me! Nobody intimidates. Personne! But when you speak to me, kindly speak English. Tres bien, tres bien. Very well. We'll speak the truth in English then. The truth seems more naked in English, but it is not, therefore, more easily embraced. We will drink some wine. You will not drink here. Ah, but wine is a notable source of the truth, Monsieur. You've no glasses. What kind of a school is this? I've had enough of this. What are you trying to do? Talk to you! Perhaps there are paper cups. It is true that my son brought to school this magazine, La Gay Paree. Perhaps that was a mistake, perhaps there are minds here that are not as well adjusted as my son's. In our family, you understand, these magazines are for humor, not for excitement. There is a difference. That is a matter of opinion. No that is a matter of fact. My son is not the kind that draws dirty pictures. That is a different kind of mind, you understand? A small investigation will show it. A small investigation has already proven beyond a doubt that the boy did draw it. Oh-ho! What have we here? Aha! It is with this he evokes the truth, huh? Don't you try to bully me! And let me tell you something, sir. Your son drew that picture because I say he drew it. And I will be believe against him, against you, against the entire French population of Ottawa. And if you object to the fact that I used that strap on your son, I will say to you that I will not tolerate a loud attitude in my school, that I will maintain discipline by the continued use of that strap, that the Board of Education condones it, and the law allows it. And if any of you so much as lays a finger on me, I'll have the three of you clapped in jail! Now get out, and take your wine with you! Now just a moment! Let me see that cane! I warn you, take care! This is the same cane! I remember the silver band, and the whole design, there, there couldn't be two alike in the whole world. And you are the same man! Name of a dark blue pig! My brothers, this is the man who sat next to me at the Casino Burlesque in Montreal. Huh? No! DESMONDE: Not once, but many times. No? I thought his face was familiar! What are you getting at? And the voice, too! Now this is the one who cries the loudest! Take it off! Take it off! And with the cane hooks the garters thrown from the stage. It's a lie, an outrageous lie! Who would believe such a story? I would. It has the ring of truth, believe me. I can prove it is true! The doorman, my friend, and the girls, they will remember him. Uh, wait 'til the neighborhood hears of this! You wouldn't dare spread such a scandal! I'll deny it! Ah, but in this case, many people would believe our truth, and not yours. You're not the only one with a dirty mind, mon ami. It'll make great news, believe me. Oh, you wouldn't dare! But we could dare! To spread this story about you after what you said about my son! And I could make you admit it. With this strap that you have used on my son! I could come here every day with this strap, or find you anywhere else. And beat you! And beat you, and beat you! Until you say, Yes! I have been to the burlesque! But it's not the truth! Ah, now we have it, the truth! That's the point! Where does it lie? Let us try to find it together, shall we? Louis, there are paper cups in the hall. Desmonde, a chair, a chair for the Principal. And now, the class will come to order. (ALL SINGING) Well, Bibi, truth has won a great victory today. The principal now understands I didn't draw the picture? Understands? He insists! Jacques, is everything all right? Everything, my love. There will be no more trouble. Let us drink to the Bonnard family! Ah, yes, a toast is in order. Bibi, up you go! Oh, not on the table! Ah, this is an occasion! The Bonnard family! From Napoleon to Bibi! Oui! Congratulations, Bibi. Papa, My Uncles. You are very great men. (LAUGHING) And don't we know it. (ALL LAUGHING) Desmonde. Huh? JACQUES: Come down, Bibi. This principal? Did you ever see him at the Burlesque? Who knows? When I'm at the Burlesque, I don't look at the customers. Uh, where's Mignonette? Mignonette has gone. Gone? Mignonette has gone? She didn't want you to know. But, uh, what do you mean she's gone? Where? I don't know where, but she's left us forever, and I don't blame her after what you did! Lying to her about a house you didn't even own! Oh, so that's it! I tell you, this is absurd! But you don't deny it! Oh, it's possible I exaggerated slightly. Uh, the usual thing you tell a girl. Now, what's a house more or less? To Mignonette it was everything. Desmonde, you treated her miserably! A man who not only lies but who sneaks into her room at night to steal a kiss! What? She said I did this, that I went into her room? She did, and I believe her! You should be ashamed! DESMONDE: But I do not eat this kind of bread! I swear it's not true! SUSAN: What kind of a girl did you take her for? Like all your others that you steal garters and kisses from? But name of a cow! I stole nothing from her! I wouldn't do a thing like that to her. I love her... Don't you understand? I'm in love with her! Then you picked a fine way to show it! No wonder you her. I love her and I've lost her! It doesn't seem possible! And over something I never did! You mean it, Uncle Desmonde, you love Mignonette? Like fireworks! But she would never believe it now. Bibi, you can help me with the table tonight. Excuse me, Maman, but we have a question of love and truth to settle here. Love and truth. Oui. When the two are together, it is very strong. It is of the greatest significance, is it not, Papa? Yes, yes, it is that, Bibi. I, too, am a Bonnard. When one is hurt, all are hurt. Uncle Desmonde, Papa, Maman, Uncle Louis... Well, what is it you wish to say, Bibi? It was I who stole the kiss from Mignonette in her room. Bibi! What? It is not necessary to lie for me, Bibi. But it's the truth! Believe me! I did it! In this house we speak only the truth, tu comprends? Uncle Louis will tell you! The other night we spoke of Rudolph Valentino, and the magic of a kiss! Remember, Uncle Louis? That is true. We agreed this Rudolph Valentino had a great love in his heart. And it was right after that that I, I went into Mignonette's room, and kissed her while she was asleep. Bibi! Bibi! Bless you! I'm going to find that girl, and make her listen. If I have to search every inch of Ottawa! The entire Dominion of Canada! And even buy her that house! Eh bien, I, too, shall go out now! Twice in a day? That's a record! Ah, but this is a day, my brother. This is a day when the blood moves in the veins. I, too, go on a mission of love, to make happy the heart of my daughter! I go to find the stabilized Alfred! Well, Jacques, I don't think you can put it off any longer. Yes, the moment has come, our little boy is growing up. Well, I'll, uh, I'll be in the kitchen. Good. Something that matter, Papa? Hmm? No, no, I... It's just that I think you and I should have a little talk. Sit down, Bibi. Well... There is no need to ask you why you did what you did. No. The reason is obvious. You did it because... Why did you do it? I had a desire to know what would happen if I kissed Mignonette, the way Valentino did. You were curious. Oui, curious. Nothing more? There is something more, but I don't know what it is. Ah! Well then, it is this, uh, something more of which we shall speak. Now you see, Bibi, this, uh, this desire you have is a natural one and since it is natural, it cannot be bad. It becomes bad only when the reason is bad. That's why so many people are mixed up. I, too, am mixed up. Why of course. So am I. (CHUCKLES) Well, let's try to unmix ourselves, shall we? Now Bibi, we speak now of love. Yes, Papa. And where there is love, there is also desire. They go together, love must have the desire, I don't believe there can be love without it. But, it is possible to have the desire without love, and this is where the world falls apart. For instance, you don't understand why the principal of your school beat you. No, Papa. Well, it is because he has been brought up to believe that the desire is wrong. And since he himself has the desire, he is even more mixed than we are. He has been brought up in a world where the desire has been used so badly, so badly! Believe me! That now it, itself, is thought to be bad. And this is wrong. This is wrong, Bibi. And you know the reason for this condition? It is because so many people are without love. Many people? Many. Uncle Louis? You love your Uncle Louis, don't you? I love him strongly. That's good. He has a great need of love. Ah, without love, one is defeated. But this love is different. The love I've for Uncle Louie is different from the love I've for you, it's also, is different from the way I love Maman. And then. Mignonette! Et oui, Bibi. And this love we speak of now. When it is real, when it is true, it is the greatest love of all. I know. We have it here in this house, Maman and I. It is the best, it is the most natural. In this way the world comes down to a house, and a room, and a bed, and if there are two people in love there, that is the whole world. Of course, you, you won't know this for many years. You know, it's possible never to know it. I hope you will. If you are as lucky as I am, you will. I will look for someone like Maman. Oh, no, no, no. On the contrary. The secret is not to imitate. Look for your heart's need, and she will come. Well, I've talked enough. And still you don't know what I wish to say. I think I do. Well, perhaps when you are a little older, and we speak of this again, I will find better words. Oh, by the way. Uh, I left something in your room, it's in a box. For me? Tell me if you like it? Merci. Papa. Papa, I... Yes, Bibi? (BOTH SINGING IN FRENCH) Ah Water! I'm parched! The well is dry! Oh! (BOTH SINGING IN FRENCH) Jacques? What is it? Look! It's Louis with the stabilized Alfred. Who is not so stabilized. Louis, where did you find him? In jail, of course! But we've made a few steps since. Are you friends now? Yes, we have settled the problem. The sons will go to the University, the daughters will go to work. Alfred, you're a son-in-law worth keeping. (BOTH SINGING IN FRENCH) You see, darling, it's true, love conquers all, of course a little wine also helps. (LAUGHING) Grandpa! Ah, bonsoir! I'm late. Where are you going? Out. You should be in bed. It is only a matter of time. No! Now this must stop! Susan. Jacques, he... Please. Let him be. He will live as long as he loves. (CAR HONKING) (LAUGHING) Jacques! Susan! Look what I found. It wasn't necessary to search all Canada. This way! Now, do you know where she went? Where? Straight into the arms of my rival! You find her where? At the movies, where else? Looking at Rudolph Valentino! But, uh, she has given him up. Yes, I have decided, if I must live in a tent, I'd rather do it with Desmonde. Absolument. There is no question about it. Nothing will stop her from marrying me. She's like a cat on hot bricks. Hello, Mignonette, welcome home. Oh, Bibi! (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) Oh, Bibi, you are irresistible! Come, Bibi, let us see you. Well, turn around. Bibi... Oh, it's wonderful. I must give you something. This is our great day. I have obtained a bride, you have obtained long pants. I think you will like this. Oh, thank you, Uncle Desmonde, it looks like a good one. The best! It was given to me personally by the General, during the war. Et voila! Merci mille fois! (APPLAUSE) Oh, Robert, you've got long pants! Oh-ho, Peggy O'Hare, the fighting American! You look very sweet, Peggy. And your hair is lovely. Thank you. And your braces are gone. Yes, they are. Uh, Jacques, you'll be late for the theater. Eh... Oh, the theater. Yes. Thank you very much. Mignonette, wouldn't you and Desmonde like a cup of coffee? Of course, we'd love it, Madame. Come, Desmonde. Uh, yes, my love. Gee, you look different, Robert. Do I? Why did you get me into trouble today? I don't know. Name of a name! You know I didn't draw that picture! Jimmy Bishop drew it! Who cares about Jimmy Bishop? Gee, you look nice. Come here. We'll have the truth now. I did not draw that picture! No, Robert! Bien. You wish to be my girl? Mmm-hmm. The teeth, please. Bien. If you are my girl, you won't get me in any more trouble? Bien. It's settled then. You're my girl. Okay, Robert, but if I'm your girl I deserve something. What? Uh, a model. Oh, yes, of course. This is a very famous medal, accepted personally from the General. Close your eyes. Oh, no! (SIGHS) Well, Bibi, is everything all right? How are you getting along with Peggy? Uh, everything is very much changed with the long pants, Papa. It's different! It's different! Papa! What happens here?
