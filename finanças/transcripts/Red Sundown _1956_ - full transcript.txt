* RED SUNDOWN * Water! Wait. Don't be a pig. I don't know how much longer I coulda held out. You are Alec Longmire, ain't ya? Yeah. I'm Bud Purvis. Heard they got ya at Mobeetie. I'm a hard man to hold. Where ya headed? You tell me. Paseo? Good enough. I've heard plenty about your Kickaroo draw. They say it's the fastest yet. Just tricky. When I was your age, I thought of nothin' else. Used to practice the draw 2 or 3 hours a day. So did my brother Mike. He's dead. It makes ya think. Sure does. Mike used to ride with McCormick, didn't he? Yeah, a long time ago. They got McCormick, last week. Oh!... I was with him. "PASSEO SALOON" Hey... uh, where we can wash up? Out there. You go ahead. All right. Oh, there's nothing like it. Ah!... I'm kinda hungry. How bout you? I ain't eaten since I left Mobeetie last night. Well, it's about time then. I'm fresh outta cash. Forget it. Somebody's gettin' up steam for a big night. Sounds like they got, a head start. Come on, set 'em up on him. That's what he thinks. This time it's on you! Frank, should see your face! You know I'll tell you something, if he wasn't my brother I'd... would give you a beating... Come on, what are you waiting for? We came to Saint-Louis, to get these bridge boys. Come on, leave it all here, for us to have fun!... Come on, cut 'em loss! This table's taken mister. Yeah... I took it. Okay? I asked you if it was ok. My brother asked you a question. That's no kinda of answer. Come on, Alec. Anybody home? Ah!... This is the end of the line. These horses are beat and so am I. I'll bet you got a sack of coffee in that bedroll. They'd spot smoke 5 miles away. Ah!... I sure am hungry. I got some bread and a jar of strawberry jam. Well, what are you waiting for? This place sure looks deserted. Yeah. I must be getting old. I remember once I could take all this and think nothin' of it. I'm a little beat myself. Naw, naw, I mean old inside. Just think, last night I was waitin' my trial in Mobeetie. Hm!... Until you showed up, I wasn't sure, but what I'd been better off stayin' there. We're not in the clear yet. Here. Thanks. Hm... that sure is good. There's nothing like strawberry. Woah!... Where were you goin', when you picked me up? Just givin' the horse his head. That's what started me. I took a job once. Worked a while, got restless and then drifted. I had a chance to pick up some easy dough with my gun. I took that too. Same!... You know what I'd do, if I had it to do all over again? What? I'd get me a real job and stick with it. 30 and keep? Now!... I'd even work for less. I've hired my gun a lot of times and made plenty with it. Hmm!... And now I even got, the makin's to show for it. Thanks. No, sir... not even the Makin's. Down there. Spot! Wake up! Get outta the door. Hold this against ya. Tight! You'll feel better stretched out on the bunk. Haen!... Ah!... Maybe it's not as bad as you think. Do not kid me! Don't waste lead. We'll sweat them out. I've been with a lot of men when they died... I've heard 'em laugh at the end. And I've heard 'em curse and whine. I was with Joe McCormick when he got his. He shore went slow. He kept lookin' back on his life and trying to put the blame, for mess that had made her. You know what I think? What Bud? We ain't got no one to blame but ourselves. Alec!... I been thinking. Dig yourself a grave. What? Yeah, about 2 feet deep. I'll cover ya up... and leave an old tin can or a piece of stove pipe stickin' out so you can breath. When they rush us, I hold 'em off. They'll think you got out some other way. And I leave ya to them, huh? I ain't got a prayer and you know it. Do what I tell ya! Why don't you get back, on that bunk? You never hear of anybody makin' it with a bullet in his gut. Come on. I'm doing this to give you a chance. All my life I've been at it. A big hero, fast on the draw. Kids taggin' after me in every town, like I wore a medal. Look what it's got me. They sure weren't very considerate, where they plugged me. A guy warned me once... like I'm tryin' to warn you now Alec... but I wouldn't listen. I was to big. Gimme your promise kid... If you pull outta this, you'll quit livin' by the gun. What do you say? I promise. All right, good! Go on now and get the shovel. Hurry up. About 2 feet deep. It's a pretty neat job kid. Maybe you missed your callin'. Yeah!... Hurry up. I ain't got much time. This is for Frank. What was that? Now put that tin can over the end of the pipe. Angle it under the wall so you can breathe from the outside. Here, Alec. Thanks. This is all I got left from bein' a big man. Do you think you'll be able to breath alright, Alec? Yeah, Bud, it's okay. All right. Where are they? They won't be long now. Good luck to you kid. Have a drink on me if you get outta here. Where's the other one? Are you comin' out? He'll come out. Well, where's the body? Couldn't a been completely burned up. Must've made it outta here. Played us for chumps. Well, what do we do now? I don't know. What about this other guy? Leave 'im for the buzzards. Come on. Let's get outta here. Boy, you're gettin' good, Lester. Let me try one. Hughie! Yes, Mom? If you keep that up you'll wake the baby Okay, Mom. Come on, Chuck. Yes, sir. That was good shootin'. One of these days I'll buy me a genuine sixgun. They costs $ 17. Well... someday. Let me carry it for awhile. Pow. Got him! Right between the eyes. Do you think Jade Murphy really shot it out with Wild Bill Hickock? Everyone say so. But he's still alive. Wild Bill musta missed. Not him. You hear lots of things. Who's that? "HANO SALOON" Hi. Hi. Say, that?s a nice rifle you got there. Thanks. How's the huntin' around here? I don't know. We just practice. Did you see the way he walks? Like a cat. It's a sign he' plenty fast. What's the matter? Didn't you ever see a Gila monster before? Yeah, but not in a saloon. There's a case full of Rattlers on the other side of the door. Harry, give the man a drink. Sure. Eddie Feltzer here is a good businessman, you know. If a drunk staggers in and leans up against one of those cases... 9 out of 10 times he'll turn right around and buy himself another drink. My name is Murphy. Jade Murphy. I'm, uh, Alec Longmire, Sheriff. Alec Longmire, huh? I've heard about of you. So now you'll go back to your office, go through a pile of dodgers and see if I'm wanted, huh? Yeah, will I'll find ya? Let's go see. Finish your drink. My Pop said he's tired of keepin' the store and listening to women talk. One of these days he's gonna take off. I mean, if Mom lets him. Just across the street there. Hi, Mr. Murphy. How're you men? How ya doin'? Oh, just fine. You don't suppose Jade's arresting 'im? We don't have much trouble around here, that is, from outsiders. Trouble's the one thing I'm not lookin' for. Well, you've got a reputation mister. Call a man a dog, someone throws a rock at 'im. Huh!... To save you some time, Sheriff, I'm not wanted, as far as I know, anywhere. You're runnin' though. Anybody likely to show up lookin' for ya? If I knew that, I'd live a lot longer, wouldn't I? No, I'm lookin' for a job. Maybe Durango's the place. Man's word's good enough for me. If I don't find a job, I'll move on. Fair enough. I'll need a room. Well, we got the Plains Hotel up on the corner. Cheap and clean. Besides, it's the only one we've got. Come on, I'll introduce you. Thanks. 'Hi ya, Mr. Murphy. Hello, men. Say, I just said hello to you. What are ya up to? Uh, who's your friend, Mr. Murphy? Oh, sorry I didn't introduced myself, gentlemen. My name is Longmire. You're not Mike Longmire? No, I'm his brother, Alec. I knew Mike's real fast, Mr. Longmire? Mike's dead. When I grow up, I'm gonna be the fastest draw in Texas. Some of the best men I know can't draw a lick... and some of the worst can outdraw me from here to Sunday. Now, what do ya suppose he meant by that? Folks say a lots of things I do not understand. That was a nice thing you said to the boys. Oh, they probably didn't get it. Yeah, some folks feel a man can't change his ways, once the stamps on him. I am not one of those. I thought you'd like to know. What's all the wire for? Woah!... It's Ruf Henshaw's. He, uh, he owns the Triple X Ranch out here. He's gonna try to fence in the squatters and small cowmen. They're not gonna like it. You blame 'em? You taking sides already? You see, the titles aren't clear on more than half this land around here, and... Henshaw is trying to grab a lot of acreage don't belong to him or there's some question about. On the other hand, Sam Baldwin, Bert Flynn and some of the other squatters have... registered brands to cover his, like... Four Diamonds, fits right over Triple X. The same old story, huh. Yeah, and in the same old way, men'll die. Yeah. Alec... I need some help. Would you be interested? I'm lookin' for a nice quite job. 150 a month? Better than you can do wrestling cattle. Yeah, but cows don't shoot at you. Come on. Whose side the Sheriff on? Well, that's a good question. If I said I'd stay with the side that was right, it wouldn't be much of an answer, because there's right on both sides. The way I look at it, it's up to the court to decide on the right and the wrong. 'Til then, my job's to keep peace. So... I'm in the middle. That's a good way to get run over. Son... if you really want a job around here, you don't have much choice. The little outfits can't afford you, and all Henshaw'll want is your gun. Not that he isn't pretty good with a gun himself, he just doesn't like to get his hands dirty. Why don't you come up to the house tonight for supper? We'll talk about it. Best invitation I had all day. Who's he? Never seen him before. I don't know. Hello, Alec. Am I early? No, right on the dot. Come on in. Thank you. Give me your hat. Hey, you do alright for yourself. It's not bad, huh? I don't blame you for likin' your job. I haven't see a place like this since I was a kid. Good evening! Alec, this is my daughter, Caroline. Honey, this is Alec Longmire. Hello! How do you do? Well, I didn't expect this. I had you down for an old bachelor. Oh no, not me! Dad tells me you may come to work for him. Well, it's his idea. What do you think about it? Hmm, deputies come and go. Hey now, you're a big help. I've seen a lot of them. Ready for supper? I, uh, really made an impression on her. Didn't I? She's a little touchy about gunfighters. Oh no, I don't think you'll need those to eat with. Come on. Thanks. Well, there's nothing like home cooking and this is the best. Thank you. No more for me. Ah, can I help you with anything? No, I can manage. I wipe dishes like no one you ever saw. So you're as handy with a towel as you are with a gun, huh? Like a cigar? No, no thanks. Excuse me, I'll get my pipe. Sure. You, uh... used your company dishes tonight, didn't you? Hmm, hm... Dad wants to impress you with the virtues of home life. I'm considered an added attraction. I'm afraid I haven't done very well. Well, you about half scared me off. Whats the matter? Have I got two heads? No, two guns. So do half the men in town. They don't use them as well as you do. Look, I uh, came here looking for a job with cattle. Jade is trying to change my mind. See, what I'm really out for is a place of my own. I've heard that same speech from every gunslinger who's come to town. They don't last. Why not? They pin on a star, make a few Sheriff like motions and then sell their guns, to Henshaw. Man takes a job, he should stick with it. And how do you know I won't? If I take the job, I mean. Because it's a regular pattern. You all perk up when you see a young girl. Make a speech about home cooking, give me a fast whirl about how nice I look. I haven't said that. But you'll get to it. Yeah, maybe some of it's your fault. Mine? Well, you look at gunslingers like they're all peas outta the same pod. It's time you realize that they're as different as anyone else. As different as people'll let 'em be. Sure there some gunslingers who are half crazy and like to kill, but on the other hand, there are those that, uh, got a reputation they can't get away from. And then there some who'd like to settle down, but the very people who should be on their side won't give them a chance. You mean me? Yes. I didn't ask Jade for a job. I don't want that kind. But he need what I've got. What do you want me to do, turn him down? How do I know you'll stay with it? Well, would you stay with it? Oh, I don't know. I figure if a man wants to get away from guns, he should get away from them. The way I look at it, we each gotta use ourselves the best we can. Now, you wouldn't say a man was outside the law because he drew pictures, would you? Huh!... Well, the same man who draws pictures, can use an engraving plate and counterfeit money. You can use your gun to stick up a bank or to keep peace and order. It's the same gun, same bullets... same hand pullin' the trigger. All right. You just got yourself a new boy, Sheriff. If my brother Mike could see this, he'd roll over in his grave. What's on your mind, Bert? A man can take just so much. There's maybe 2 or 3 hundred miles of fence in those wagons. If it were up to me, it would be at the bottom of the river. Now you're talking, Sam... Listen, there's just the drivers left with those wagons. Are you thinking what I'm thinking? What are we waiting for? How about Jade? I took care of him. Come on. Who's there? Alec Longmire. Is Jade here? Just a minute. Sorry if I woke ya. That's alright. Where's Jade? He rode out to the D- Cross. Bert Flynn's boy stopped by. Said Bert wanted to see him, it was important. Hmm, so that's what they meant. Who? This Bert. Tall, rangy fellow looks like he's, uh, ready to a boil? Why, yes. How did you know? The other fellow's about the same height, same build. Has a big mustache, called Sam. That's Sam Baldwin. They're gonna jump Henshaw's wagons tonight and tricked Jade outta town. What're you gonna do? What I'm hired to do. Stay where you are, mister. Somethin' on your mind? You know Bert Flynn and Sam Baldwin? What about 'em? There might be trouble. Who are you? Longmire, Murphy's new deputy. Didn't know he had one. How many guards you got? What's it to you? I told you, there might be trouble. There?s a couple more at the Llano. Better get 'em. Can't leave the wagons. All right, I'll get 'em, but don't go to sleep here, they're liable to jump you any minute. Burt! Sam! Give it up! I said, give it up! Man, that shootin'! Alright, break it up! We pegged ya wrong mister. Thanks for the tip. It's alright. I'd do the same for them. We're headed for a showdown and I think it's about time. Henshaw strings that wire, I'll be cut off from grass. You're right. What'll it be, Deputy? Nothing. I see Jade got himself a new boy. Yeah, where is Jade? Not like 'im to be away at a time like this. Wonder how long before this joker sells out? Well now, maybe he's waiting for an offer. Keep talkin' boys. I'm a good listener. Deputy! Hey, you! You stand with Henshaw? No, Murphy. Then get over to his office, put your feet on the desk, let things alone. Murphy wouldn't do that. You keep stickin' your nose in, you won't be around long. Do not say you weren't warned. You threatening me? We ain't invitin' ya to tea. I'm takin' Sam to jail, Bert. You want the same thing or you goin' home? You talk like a big man, mister. Make up your mind! Well? You better square yourself with Jade. Let's not have any trouble, Sam. Excuse us, gentlemen. We're comin' through. I stay here!... You just walk and everything will be alright. Enjoy yourself while you can, mister. It won't be for long. I'm not having any more fun than you are, Sam. Lamp's on the desk, Sam. Light it. Keep your back to me, take off your gun belt and hand it over. Go through that door to the jail. Go on! First one's good enough. See ya in the morning, Sam. You're gonna see a lot of me! Well, good evening again. I heard the shooting. I had a little run in with Sam Baldwin. Did you shoot him? No. I wanted to see how it felt to arrest a man. And how does it feel? Real strange. It's first time a man ever threw down on me I didn't call 'im. You know, I think that Henshaw deliberately left those wagons there. He's tricky enough to do it. Yeah. I'd feel a lot better if you stayed at home, 'til this simmered down. All right? Alright. You've shown your hand now. The whole town will be watching you. You mean Henshaw? That's right. He'll look you up the first thing in the morning. Be glad to see 'im. Henshaw believes every man has his price. He's right! Oh, and what's your price, Mister Longmire? Well, if he buys too cheap, he won't appreciate it. And, if I come too high, he'll try and get rid of me as fast as he safely can. It's something to think about. I'm sure you'll give it your best thoughts. Deputy. May I talk with you for a moment? Sure. My name is Rufus Henshaw. I want to thank you for warning my men. Where were you when Bert and Sam tried to grab your wagons tonight? Is that important? It is to me. You really think it concerns you? I was breaking no law. You were by the river, waiting. They'd have stepped into a sweet little ambush, wouldn't they? That's an assumption I don't like. You're accusing me of bating a trap. Yes, sir. I like that.'' Yes sir''. I like a man who speaks his mind. That's fine, but you still haven't answered my question. What was it, Deputy? You were by the river, waiting. Weren't you? You are young man Longmire, new to your job. I was hoping we could be friends. Let me walk you to the hotel. I admire a man like you, a man who knows his duty. Who's willing to risk his life to keep the peace. After all, there's nothing I want more than peace. You got a mighty peculiar way of showing it, Mr. Henshaw. Got a sense of humor too. Yes sir, there's no more thankless job than a peace officer. No one likes you. Everyone's convinced you're the other fellow's man. Hm, hm, what do you think? I've got big holdings, Mr. Longmire, and they're going to get a lot bigger. I need men around me that I can trust. And I pay very well to ensure their loyalty. I wonder... I wonder if you'd be interested? How much? You'll name it. Well, I'll tell ya Mr. Henshaw... Soon as things settle down and Murphy can spare me, I'll talk to you about it. Okay? In the meantime, harness up and get your wagons out of town. I'm not very good at taking orders, Deputy. Long as your wagons are in town, we're liable to have trouble. Get'em outta here. A hot gun doesn't make a soft pillow at night. Mr, Henshaw. How right you are. Give me half an hour. You got it. Thanks! Evening gents. Ruf, I see you've uh, you've already met our new deputy. How's everything? Couldn't be better. I was just saying good night to Mr. Henshaw. See you in the mornin', Jade. Goodnight, Jade. Bart! Palaski! Harness up, we're rolling! Morning, Alec. Morning. Coffee? Uh no, thanks. I hear you had yourself quite a time last night, huh? Oh, it wasn't too bad. I just turned Sam Baldwin loose. He's almost calmed down. Yes sir, you came mighty close to being a one day deputy.. Yeah. What's up? If I were to tell you that, uh, Henshaw has hired the best gunslinger in the whole Southwest. What would you say? Chet Swann? Nobody but. How good is he? There's nothing good about 'im. He's a kid, but he's all killer. Fast, huh? The fastest. He's quick up here. Huh, huh!... Let's uh, stop in on brother Henshaw and have a little talk. If he's hired Swann, that's a fact you can't argue about. Well, I've got to try. The thing to do is to stop Swann. Yeah, well, how do you do that? There's no price on his head, but why there isn't I'll never know. I know. Swann never draws first. He doesn't have to. This spread of Henshaw's looks bigger than the whole state of Missouri. You know, my father used to say there's only three ways to get rich. Having someone leave it to you, work for it and to steal it. What I hear, Henshaw's used all three of 'em. Yeah, he's a man who looks to the future alright, he... He says once the ranch is secure he's going back East to find himself a high-classed Boston woman and live like a king. That's the part I like. You'd better let me do the talking. You prod 'im and he may get his back up. He's your baby. I just came along for the ride. Hello, Maria. So good to see you again... Thank you, thank you. Maria, shake hands with my new. Alec! Maria. Well, you two know each other? Oh, Maria and I are old friends. Why did you come here Alec? What's the matter? You must not stay, Alec. That you, Sheriff? Yes, Ruf. Excuse me. Yes. Alec, there is much danger here. What are you doing out there, Maria? Alec, be careful. Please! Nice to see you, Jade. Ruf. Sit down. Maria, the Sheriff may want a drink. No, no, thank you, Maria, a little to early for that. I remembered. You like 'em mild. Yeah, you never forget anything, do you? Ruf, there are a couple of things that have come up that, uh... that I think we outta talk about. Huh, go ahead, talk. Word's come to me that, uh, you've hired Chet Swann. Chet Swann? Who's he? You know who he is. Yes, I do. Hiring a gunman's not the answer. Violence is a last resort. I'd like avoid it. I lost 20 calves last month. A week ago, twenty new calves turned up at Sam Baldwin's with fresh Four Diamonds brands on them. Two weeks ago, Bert Flynn turned his herd into my North section. Just yesterday somebody fouled my waterhole in the West quarter. Ruf, I don't blame you for gettin' sore. Yeah, for my part, I've done what I could to stop it. And I'll continue to do so, but hiring a killer is not going to solve anything. Jade, I been thinking about you. You been working hard here for 5 or 6 years. Occurred to me you might want a vacation. Ever been to New Orleans? No. Well, why you and Caroline take the trip as my guests? Do ya a world of good. A little obvious, aren't you? Then, when I came back, you would have everything here under control. Wouldn't ya? Things might work themselves out. But I've waited a year for the court to hand down its decision. I know you have. I'm going back East as soon as things straighten out. I'll need someone to run Triple X. It's not a bad job. The ranch is growing. One of these days, I'm gonna try purebred. It's a great opportunity. I'm sure of that Ruf, but... I'll pay you double what you're getting now. And, a share of the profits. Let's face it Jade, you're not getting any younger. Yeah, you're so right about that, but... When folks elected me to office, they figured I'd stay on the job. That's up to you, Jade. Think about it and 'do' something. I don't want my hand forced. Henshaw told me what happened last night. It would be better if you left Durango, because if you stay here I sure would be... Maria! Hello, Mr. Henshaw. Get into the house. Maria's an old friend of mine. I see! But surely the gentleman will excuse you, Maria. Please. You must visit me again, Mr. Longmire. It'll be a pleasure. Think it over, Jade. Not much to think about is there? Peace on your terms or else, huh? Won't work. We'll see. Come on, Alec. Lord, we thank you for the blessings of this day, bless this. You got enough stew for callers? Not if you want seconds. Afternoon! Come in, come in. Thank you. Oh, I didn't mean to disturb your meal. Quite alright, what can we do for you? Well, I was parched. I was wondering if I could. Of course. Just bring in your canteen. Oh... that'd be to much trouble, uh, a cup full would be fine. Well, go right over and help yourself. Thanks. Thank you, ma?am. Sam. I think you ought to ask the gentleman to join us. Oh, sure. Here, I'll get another chair. No, don't please. Now, we don't have company very often. Not since the children married. Now, please sit down. There! Our name is Baldwin. You just passin' through? No, sir. Oh! You're uh, lookin' for a job in these parts? No, sir. I got a job. This is delicious. Thank you. See ya got nice linen. Yes, isn't it. It's been in our family for a long time. Who you workin' for? Man name of Henshaw. As a cow puncher, of course. No, ma'am. I got more talent than that. Gunslinger! If I have to, I use my gun. That's where my talent lies. What does Henshaw want? Oh, he just asked me to drop over and say goodbye to you nice people. We're not leaving. Oh. Stay as long as you like. No. 24 hours at least. You know, I'm real sorry you gotta leave. You're such a fine cook. Please, stop it! It's nice, real nice. Goodbye, Mrs. Baldwin. Thank you for a wonderful dinner. Goodbye, Mr. Baldwin. It's been a pleasure. Oh... I forgot to introduce myself, didn't I? My name is Swann. Chet Swann. Jade! It's that Chet Swan. He... Well, get your breath, Sam. What about him? He came to see me. He's given me 24 hours to clear out. If you can't handle him, Bert and I know what to do. Well? Where's he now? Comin' here, I guess. No one is runnin' anyone out. Go on home now, Sam, and forget about it. The rest of you fellows, clear outta here. Dad! Alec! Maria, what are you doing here? Where've you been? I've been waiting for you a very long time. Swann is coming, to kill you and Jade. Why you tellin' me this? We're old friends, Alec. I can not forget the old days. The old days are over, Maria. You don't trust me. You think maybe it is a trick, don't you? Believe me, it is no trick. I've had enough. Henshaw? Yes. You never were lucky with men, were you. Isn't it always this way. But please, don't let trouble find you. You thinkin' of stayin' town? Only until morning. Then I will take the stagecoach. Come with me Alec, please! Please come with me. It's no good, Maria. What will you do? Stay here and die in the dust? Alec, I...Oh. I'm sorry. I... What is it? Swann's on his way into town. Jade needs you. If you can spare the time? I'll be right there. Your girl, she did not like what she saw. It's not my girl. If she was not your girl, she would not have minded that I am here. It's all I've got Maria. Good luck. You gonna shoot it out with Swann? Not if I can help it. How you gonna help it? Why don't you boys go home until things calm down, huh? Go home? Ha! Boy, the sun shines today! Morning, Alec. Thought you'd be loading your shotgun by now. Why would I load a shotgun for? Well, if I were Sheriff and Swann was on the prowl for me, I'd be up on the roof with a shotgun. Sometimes you don't make good sense, son. There's nothing in the that says the sheriff has to be a hero, just keep the peace. Now, if I was the Sheriff and I wanted to keep the peace, I'd go up on the roof and let him have it the legs. But you'd rather take him prisoner, wouldn't ya? If I was to use a shotgun, I wouldn't have a friend in town. I'd be worse than stabbing a man in the back. You would if your life depended on it. Jade, you'll not gonna like what I'm gonna say to you. You try and shoot it out with Swann, you're dead. You get old fast with a gun. Day comes when you slow down. When all your skill 'n experience doesn't mean a thing. And if you're smart, you know what'll happen if you miss. Because if you're old, you'll value what's left of your life. And a kid like Swann doesn't know what it is to be afraid. I've seen him work. He'll gun you down before you clear the holster. You haven't got a prayer. I'm tellin' you like I'd tell my own father. I wouldn't be able to hold my head up if I used a shotgun. Well, alright. Be a hero. Shoot it out with 'im. See if it makes any difference to me. Go ahead, and put on a show for a lot of gutless fools who take cover when it starts. Give the drunks somethin' to talk about in the winter. Present the town with a first- class funeral. Maybe your good friend Henshaw will deliver the eulogy! Will you stop it! Make your play. Don't think about Caroline. I've thought of her, and you. I thought of everything. There are ways to do things and that's not one of 'em. Alright. Alright! He's here. That's Swann, I betcha. Oh, Dad! Caroline, you shouldn't have come back here. Oh, Dad, please. I'll be alright. No you won't. You know you won't! You haven't a chance. Let me go, dear. Alright, Jade. I'll take him on. You want folks to think I was yellow and siced you on 'im? No, thanks. I'm telling you you can't go out there. Look son, nobody can tell me what I can't do, not even you. He'll be alright. You gonna use a shotgun? You couldn't miss nothing with that. I don't intend to miss. I'd crawl before I'd use a shotgun. Get inside. Both of you. Go on! Chet Swann! Get outta town. Well, Alec Longmire! I almost didn't recognize you with that cannon in your hands! Mount up, before I blast ya all over the street. Aw, ain't near as friendly as he used to be. Aren't you even gonna let me buy you a little drink for old times? You're wasting your time. Now, get goin'. You know, I wouldn't have believed it. A tin star! A tin star on Alec Longmire. Get goin'! Alright. I guess you ain't the Alec I used to know. So long, Alec. I'll see you around. Go on home. The show's over. What show? Come on, Chuck. Want your star back? No, Alec, you keep it. I was wrong, dead wrong. It isn't over. Henshaw hasn't stopped yet. He'll try somethin'. Come on. I'll buy ya a drink. You need it. Drop it, Alec. It's a nice chair ya got here. Real comfortable. I thought I told you to get out of town. That was your cannon talkin'. I should've let you have it with, both barrels. Now what a way to talk to a guest, an old friend at that. You can save the auld lang syne. We never were friends. Weren't we? I got a job, Alec. Well, don't tell me about it. I'm not interested. You mean you're not interested in living? Must be kinda dull, being a lawman. Yeah, especially when I have to listen to you. Be social. You're makin' me sorry I didn't squeeze the trigger when you came through the door. What stopped you? I don't know. Call it friendship. I hate to repeat myself, but I don't like any part of you and I never did. You can't change by pinnin' a tin star on your shirt. You and me, were two of a kind. If that's so, you better put that six shooter to work right now. You know, I don't get you. Here I keep tellin' myself, there's no sense doin' in a fellow gunfighter. Especially since I already been paid for the job. And here you are, askin' me for a ticket to Boot Hill. Alec, get smart. Move on with me. I'm not going anywhere yet. This is a nice town with nice people. This bunch of fat bellies? And I happen to like it well enough to stick around a while. You think they'll forget, what you were? Why should they? I won't. You know, I don't know what you got against gunfighters. You gotta have gunfighters, wouldn't be right not to. Be like not havin' rattlers in the desert. Now, doesn't that make real sense? Get up. That's a nice soft bed you got there. But you better not be sleeping on it from here on. Just in case any of you can't read or have poor eyesight... I'll read the notice to you. Triple X, will fence tomorrow. Interference will be met with gunfire. That a legal notice you're posting, Mr. Henshaw? You can take it anyway you like. We don't like it 'n we're not gonna take it. Exactly my sentiments. We'll be waiting for you. He's got that wrong, hadn't he? What Mr. Henshaw means is, we'll be waiting on him while he cools off in our comfortable jail. Open your eyes. Those are rifle barrels breathing down your neck. Take your blinders off, Henshaw, and look around. Alright, get their guns. All of 'em. I think you'll find our jail a little more peaceful, Mr. Henshaw. What's the charge? Disturbing the peace. Least that'll do for a start. In that case, neither of you will be around for the finish. Why don't you stop talking so big? Let him talk. Go ahead and talk. He'll be back. Swann? And this time he'll put a bullet in your back You rat. You're the kind that breeds gunslingers. Never dirty your own hands, never fight your own battles, never stick your own neck out. I fight fire with fire, gunslinger with gunslinger. I do not!... Now, let's lock 'im up. Ruf... Here's your drink of water. Anything else you'd like? Yeah... a seat by the window, so I can watch you and Longmire get yours. That's not Swann. What's going on here? Stick around. Your liable to see something you can tell your grandchildren about. Yeah? Yep. Alec. You better get inside somewhere. I have to talk to you. This is hardly the place. Please Alec. I want to apologize. I'm sorry for believing you couldn't change. I'm sorry for thinking what I thought when I saw you with that girl. Did you talked to Maria? No. She couldn't tell me anything I don't know about you. What do you know? That I'm afraid for you. Oh Alec, must you wait for Swann. What do you want me to do, run away and hide? If it would keep you alive, yes. But I wanna stay alive. So please Caroline, go away. I gotta keep my eyes open and my mind on nothin' else but Swann. Well, isn't there any another way? I made a promise to a man before he died. I promised him I would quit livin' by the gun. And here I am, with a gun still in my hands. Then why stay? Because I'm wearin' this badge. The only place I've got a right to wear it, is in this town. That's why I've got to wait for Swann to show up again. So please Caroline, go inside somewhere, will you? Alec, I'm gonna get up a posse. Swann'll smell a posse a mile away. Well, at least we'll scare off. Yeah, and I'll be livin' scared, jumpin' at shadows. Why don't you let me do it my way? Come on, Caroline. Come on, honey. Where's Jade going? Not far, I betcha . Dad, I can take care of myself. Now, don't argue about it. You're gonna stay at Mrs. Blake's 'til it's over. Are you going to get up a posse? I tried. Hold it, Jade! Move this way. Both of you! Come on. Dad! Oh Dad! Let me go! Let me go! This ain't like us, Alec. Splash the shotgun, and I'll let the lady go about her business. Then we can go about ours. One sound outta you and it's your last. Alec! Look out! He got 'im! He did it! He did it! Hey Alec, you going away? You leavin' town? I am. No! Why? Why Alec? You wouldn't understand, man. Morning, Alec. Morning Jade. How you feelin'? Better, thank you. Good. Well, uh, you might be needin' this. I'm here to say goodbye. Where you going? Well, it's like Jade said, there's not much in the way of jobs around here. Might take the courts a year or more to decide what they wanna do. You must have something in mind, Alec. My Dad used to say it wasn't enough for a man to bring his wife his heart 'n his head. He had to offer her the fruit of his hands. The way things stand, is not much to offer. See ya Jade. Take care of yourself, hear. I'll be back. I'll be seein' you, men. Hey, where's your rifle today? We don't need it anymore. "THE END"
