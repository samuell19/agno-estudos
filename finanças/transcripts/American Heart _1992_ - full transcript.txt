That depends on you. you're a middleweight criminal, and I'm hopin' for your sake, you're retirin'. - I'm seriously considering it. This early release is a six-month conditional period, Jack. if I think it's more than you can handle, I'll send you back to serve out your time, one year. - Ten months, sir. Says here, you got a son, Nick. - What about him? - Where's he at? He's livin' with my sister, Vera, on her farm. He loves it over there. He's a, you know, hick "4-her", cows and peas and all that. Maybe that's best for now. - Lookin' for a job? - I sent over 152 letters asking for one. - Didn't get no reply. - Special skills? No, I can't do nothin'. Well, here's an opening for a window washer. - They hire ex-cons? - They might. Can I bum one of your cigarettes? Yeah, get one but don't make no habit out of it. Keep your piss clean. Maybe you'll make it on the outside. You won't get no trouble from me. I plan to come through just like a giant. - Be strong, brother. - Yes, sir. Because you're his aunt. He's a part of you. You still got my shoes over there? Yeah. well, bring 'em when you come collect the kid. Yeah. I'm over at Rainey's, 913 spruce. Shit. - That my jacket? - That's my jacket, man. - No, come on. I need this. - I had this jacket for five years, man. It don't even fit you no more. - That's your old man, right there. - I feel like a human being. Yeah. How about my end? Where's my end, Rainey? Your end? You're sittin' on it, Jack. No, I... yeah, I got somethin' for ya. Just a second. Let's see. That's $200, not much. Yeah, I can get ya another $200 tomorrow, man, but... it's the best I can do. Two-hundred. - For a six large haul. - That was five years ago, Jack. That's taking into account all kinds of costs over a five-year period. I was real sad to see you take the fall, Jack. I'm grateful you didn't give me up. Hardly worth it for four stinkin' c-notes. Yeah. So where you at, Jack? You up for some action, or you walkin' spanish? I haven't even passed my last prison meal yet, Rainey. Yeah, sometimes I think about givin' it up. But it's like they say, it's in the blood, ya know? The way I figure, man, you're either the doer or the do-ee. Hey. I cased out a jewelry store up on Pill Hill, man. Very sweet. Security guard is deaf and blind. Keep it to yourself. I ain't interested. Younger generation takin' over? I ain't lookin' for a new partner. You remember me, kid? Geez. Don't remember me. I boosted flowers from the hospital grounds when you were born, man. I been there from the beginning, man. Kind of makes us like brothers. He's just hanging out. Fact, Vera and Larry's comin' to collect him tonight. Larry's a dick. I ain't goin' back. I'm sendin' for ya when I get myself settled. You can't expect to walk out of the joint and live a normal life. - Bullshit. - What do you mean, bullshit? You never get settled, Jack. What's the matter with Vera's anyway? You got fresh air, that pig of a friend. Come on. Be a stand-up, kid. God. Vera did a lousy job raisin' you. Here. Present from your old man. Jack London. Maybe Vera got lost. Is that the only razor you got? I got one face, I got one razor. So, what are we doin' today? Here. Take the bus back to Mount Vernon. Good to see ya, kid. Hey. Where's that ferry goin'? You got a room? - Sixty-five a week. Is it just you? - Yeah. If there's another person, that's an extra ten. Rent's due every friday. don't be late. I get very upset. I break out in a rash. That's okay. I'll still like ya. Now you're gonna follow my three rules to a tee. Don't tail me, shadow me.. or any way, shape or form jam me. And don't ask me to hold your stinkin' hand. 'Cause I don't need the aggravation. - Don't let Rainey in here or hang out with him. - That's five. Hey. Help me with this. Grab on to that. Pull it. Pull it! All right, we're gonna shoot to see who gets what. - What you got, odds or even? - Odds. One, two, three. The mattress. Get outta the way! Thanks. I saw a cow give birth last week. I'm sleepin'. See ya in the mornin'. what are we doin' today? I'm goin' to work. you're goin' to school. What school? I don't know. Find one. Yes? I need to sign up for school. - Did you just move here? - Yeah. You have your transcripts from your old school? Your immunization records? You got some stuff to do before you can register. Well, certain places don't work out for certain people. Since this last time in the joint, I been thinkin'. - About what? - Climbin' up to the roof of the world. - Where's that? - Alaska. Ever since I was a kid, I dreamed about Alaska. I never knew that. - This time I aim to make it up there. - When? Well, if I get through parole, springtime. I wish we had binoculars. What'll you do up there, Jack? I'll buy some entrepreneurial type enterprise... steak 'n' bake. You know, catch a meal, bring a reel. Perpetratin' cons isn't the only business there is. Didn't work out for me here, but up there's gonna be different. Man can get a fair shake without everybody breathing down his neck. Well... I never really thought about Alaska. That's because it's my dream. It's not yours. What kind of job are you workin' downtown, Jack? Buildin' supervisor. I'd like to do that. You're gonna get yourself an education. 'Course... without one, a man of my own technology, I made whole bunches of money. Several fortunes spent. Well, I'll be makin' big money real soon. Real big money. You got a quarter on ya? I think so. "Farwest." An old pen pal. 7-7-0-0. I wonder what she looks like. Yeah, is Charlotte there? Rowe? Charlotte Rowe? She works there, right? A friend. Can you tell me where she hangs out then? All right. Yeah, thank you. Hit the ball, Charlotte. Shut up, Flo, shut up. Next. Rack 'em up? I'm in the middle of a shift. Come on. It's your break. I'm not in the middle of a shift. You're in the middle of something. I'm a little... rusty at this. This whole scene. "Bam, a piss-cold pittake, a white fang." Vernon, I want a diet coke to go. You don't know how many times I've... dreamed of sittin' here like this. About a million times. Man, what a line. Watch out for this one. - I'm not tryin' to hustle you. - But you're hittin' 'em all. Next thing you'll be sayin' is, "Don't I know you from somewhere?" Yep. Can I... can I see... For cryin' all night! Let me guess, a unicorn? What are you, are you some kind of psychic? They say... the eyes are the windows of the soul... and I'm into windows. - Where ya goin'? - I told ya. Back to work. - Well, when can I see you again? - You tell me, Mr. Psychic. You mind payin' the tab here? Well... see ya. Meter's on! Unit 105, you want that fare on first avenue, or what? Unit 105. oh, don't. Don't what, 105? You start touchin' on me and you think the sky's the limit. 105, I'm not touchin' you and you're walkin' on my transmission. you want that fare on first avenue or what, 105? Do you think I'm an easy night? You're right. I'm pushin' this. - You do? - What, think you're an easy night? You wanna come up for a beer? I can't. You're right in the middle of a shift. Oh, God. Who's that? Nick? This is Charlotte. Come on. - Is that your... - Yeah. - You didn't tell me you had a kid. - I forgot. My kid's been with relatives. Hey, there's an all night... A & W down the block. Here. It's open all night. You want me to bring you back a root beer? Just take your time. I might. And I might just come right back. And I might take you to a goddamn home. This doesn't really feel right. Don't worry 'bout him. He's used to it. Come on. let's get a couple of beers, relax. What kind of a father are ya? Oh, I'm probably the worst kind, but I make up for it in other ways. God, you are a big talker. - Where ya goin'? - This doesn't feel right. So can I see ya tomorrow? I'll get a baby-sitter. I'll catch ya next time. Gimme back my money. Man, I was trippin' so fierce yesterday, man, I thought my heart was just gonna go boom, right outta my ears. Yeah, I had a heart attack once. I was running away from my uncle. - Name's Rollie, man. - Nick. Later on. Stop it, Roy. I'm gonna roast you. Not you, Creamo. Come here. You're getting me all jacked up, Roy! She likes me, don't you, Creamo? She likes anybody. Stop it, Roy! - She's got sheepdog in her. - How do you know? Oh, the shape of her paw, her coat. - Could be a herder. -It's starting, Molly! Who's there? My crib's upstairs. You sleep in a crib? So what was it you wanted? Do you subscribe to the post? Celeste had her abortion! - You need help up there? - Yeah. Hey, you gonna go to school, man? I don't see the point in perpetrating that. Yeah, I dropped out in sixth grade. My parents made me go back, though. It sucks. - What does your father do? - He just got a job in construction. What'd he do before that? He was in the penitentiary. What for? He robbed some banks, I think. A bank robber? Hey, Jack. how ya doin', man? Long time. Listen, I... come on around! I wanted to talk to you about that jewelry store, man, get some advice. - Yeah, well, my advice is get yourself a new partner. - Come on, Jack. Let me give ya a lift, ride shotgun. I got wheels, man. Come on around! Asshole. Get out! Get outta this house! - I'm leaving! - Good! Go to hell! Homeboy, you got an extra crib? Nick! Jack, you in there? Jack? - Hey, come on, get up. - What? Out the window! I ain't goin' out no window. Jack, open up! Jack, Cecil Normandy! Just don't open it. I got the landlady here. She's got the key. Oh, God. This is a shame. - Thank you, ma'am. I can handle it from here. - Makes me sick. I... I can explain this, Normandy. Wha... what, do you think I'm a pervert? Datin' 16-year-olds is one thing, but she's 12 if she's a day. - I'm 15. - Fifteen will get him 20. Stay put. Normandy, I... I wasn't in the rack with her. - I never even seen her before. - What'd you do, black out? See, it's my kid. I thought you had a son. - Turn around, Jack. - Normandy, please. - Get 'em up. - Man, don't bust me. What do you expect, man? You missed your appointment yesterday. You don't show up at work today. And I come to your place, and you drunk with a minor... in the middle of the day. Dad, this is Molly. This is my parole officer. Somebody tell me what the hell's goin' on here. She lives downstairs and she needed a place to sleep last night. I'm bailin'. Creamo, come on. Hey! I thought your son was stayin' at your sister's. Well, we're workin' on a relationship kind of thing. - I figured, why "pronasticate"? - Procrastinate. So why'd you miss the appointment? He was helping me register for school. That's... that's right. My kid's gotta get an education. What high school did you put him in? "Garfield". That's right. You're not gonna arrest him, sir, are ya? We're just starting out. He's a real good guy. I need to know you can handle this. I can handle this. - You sure you can handle this? - Yes, sir. Get outta the way. Jack, you better mind how you go. Yes, sir. See ya in my office in a week. And you take care, little brother. We got outta that jam, huh? I wouldn't have been in it in the first place if it wasn't for you. If I wasn't drinking, I could have handled it myself just fine. P.O.'s got his thumb on me. I gotta walk a line. You understand that? Shit. My life would be a hell of a lot easier without you. Are you gonna dump me? - You really goin' to school? - Yeah, sure. How come I never see no love notes from your teacher then? I leave 'em in my locker. Molly! Molly! Take Roy! I have to work! Kids. Jesus! What can you do? You just gotta know what you're doin', I guess. - You been hangin' out with her? - No. You pissin' on my leg and tellin' me it's rainin', farm boy? - You're not ready for these streets. - You fucking little selfish tramp! - I'm selfish. - Yeah, selfish. - You're just jealous... because you're old and you're used up, and you're ugly. You stick with school. Here, hold that. You don't have to take math or science or any of that crap. Now, cooking. There. Now that's a skill. you could... be a banquet captain or some such thing. or a writer... Jack London. - He graduated high school, I think. - You didn't. Never mind about me. You want to wind up in the joint and a hand like me? How about being the first in the family to make it past ninth grade? I tell you one thing. You got good timing. Could have died of old age in the joint before Normandy sorted that one out. So I'm not goin' to a home? You're here, ain't ya? Are you anywhere else? No, you're here. Yep. It's not easy being green, is it? Hey, man. I got you right here. Well, my brother says he'd pick us up tonight. Hey, baby. You lookin' for a date? I know what you're lookin' for. Look at Perry. - How ya doin'? - All right. - What do you want, the works? - Yeah. Let me see your dick. I got that baby-sitter. # Call me up on your telephone # # And talk to me for a long, long time # # Hey, Juanita, I'm comin' over # # Yeah, pretty baby # - Beer is in the refrigerator. - Where is your refrigerator? - It's over here. # Hit the town and fell in love # - Where's the bed? - It's right here. I just want you to know I used to be a virgin. So... are you involved with anybody? Now's a fine time to ask. Well, I'm just curious. Well, sort of, yeah. There is a guy. Beautiful woman like you, I wouldn't mind bein' in his shoes. Oh, yeah, you might. He's in prison. Yeah. - You know this guy before he went up? - Not exactly. You see, there's this... there's this magazine. - "American Heart"? - Yeah. Magazine that puts you in touch with your inside main squeeze? P.O. box 553, Walla Walla state penitentiary. You, you son-of-a-bitch! - Wait a minute. - You pig-dog con man! All that stuff about seeing into my soul and that psychic shit. - Charlotte. - God, I'm so stupid! - Charlotte, come on, ease up. - You screwed me just to check me out, didn't you? A little test drive, huh? Char... hey, you didn't visit me. You never gave me your home address. I was afraid you wouldn't wanna go out with me. All right. Hey, okay, I'm sorry. I should have been up-front with you. Let's start over. - No. - Hey, I think you like me. No. You expressed yourself real nice in those letters. Yeah, well, they were good. You made me feel like a human being. Hey, Nick! Nick! Nick! Come on down! I got somethin' for ya! I'm getting a rash, Mr. Kelson, a big rash. Well, that's okay. I won't think any less of ya. You owe me a month. - I can give you half that. - No. That's not good enough. I want the whole amount. I'm not gonna be stuck with your kind. Come on. - What is it? - Never mind. Get on. All right, get over there. All right. All right. What's the matter? I thought you wanted 'em. Yeah, I did. It's kind of expensive when we're late on the rent. Don't you have any faith in your old man? I'll take care of it. I don't know what's the matter with you, kid. That's just it. You're not a kid. You're like some loan officer gloom pussin' around. Hey, tomorrow's sunday. What do you wanna do? When are you gonna teach me how to play the ukulele? It's a guitar. You can learn that anytime. How'd you like to do somethin' with a lady friend of mine and me? She the one you brought home? Yeah. You'll like her. Here, take a look. We'll have a beautiful day. - Am I the only one in here who can't breathe? - All right, Nick. We're gettin' "fixicated" in here. Open that window. Here. Is there any ketchup? You're starin' at her like a goddamn yard bull. That's one fine lady. - What do you got to say? - She goin' to Alaska with you? Nobody's goin' with me. Start actin' like a stand-up kid. Don't aggravate me. Here. Here. Thanks, lady. - Charlotte. - That's me, lady Charlotte. Well... best damn hot dog I ever had. - Excuse me for eatin' with food in my mouth. - Pulley Fuss, it's a funny name. Yeah, french. Pulley Fusey. - How much this cost? - Thirty. Thirty bucks? - Here's to you. - Here's to me. You like your dogs? Hey, I'm talkin' to you. Yeah. Cool. I like it. - It don't matter. - What do you mean, it don't matter? Get the fuck outta here! Fuck you, then! - Now tuck and kick. yeah. - Yeah, you got it. All right, do it again. Check out brother's dope threads. - What's happenin'? - Like we just got out. - You got a cigarette? - Man, he's down to the curb. - Why you dissin' me for, Molly? - Get back, faggot. I got somethin' for you. Dancin' around in a two-piece for frat boys. Pays good. You dance, I deals. Easy money. - One, two, three. - Leave her alone. - What'd you say, punk? - I said, leave her alone. Now what are you doin' with my skateboard? Man! Hey, Stony man, leave the kid alone, Stony. Fuck you! - You punk! Come on! - I don't wanna hurt you, Freddie. You don't have to hurt me, Stony. Leave him alone! You can suck the corn outta my shit, too, you fuckin' punk! Get the fuck outta here! Punk! Get the fuck outta here! Freddie, I could have handled it if my back wasn't turned. You gotta watch your back around here, all right? Llisten, I been in over 600 fights down here. My specialty's the hook. Guess which hand I hook with, huh? Left's a lot bigger, right? I hook 'em in the jaw. - You okay? - Yeah. Well, you know, I would have helped you but... some two guys jumped me and pinned my arms, man, and one had a knife. I should have stomped on 'em. Rollie, I'm fine. My dad hit me with a 9:00 curfew, so I... I gotta go. Listen... later on, man. Hey. Howdy. Did you have fun today? What are you makin'? Tomato soup. Want some? Has a bona fide penitentiary aroma. Did you rob a lot of banks, Jack? Why, you think I'd be good at it? I was a smart thief. What did you steal? What, are you writin' a book? All right. I was in for the quick score. Jewelry stores. In and out. In one minute, I'd be gone. You can steal a lot in a minute. You can steal a lot in 30 seconds. When did you start? You don't start out robbing a jewelry store. You work your way up. From where? I stole my first car when I was 12. I was just about your age. I stole this beautiful, brand-new maroon Chevrolet. Rode that baby all the way to coos bay. Two inches off the ground with girls. Gave it a while, I got pretty good at it. If I ever catch you with your fingers where they don't belong... - Yeah? - I'll string you up by your short hairs. What are you worried about me for? Yeah, you got that right. I got enough to worry about. Things could be different for you. - What's the matter? What happened? - Nothing. - Well, come here. Let me see. - I said nothing. - Let me see. - Ouch! Nothing? Come here. There you go. That's it. All right. Okay, okay, okay. Turn around. All right, put your hands up. That's it. Now chin down. There you go. Now look mean. Mean. Mother of Jesus. You don't have to worry. I can take on two guys. Yeah? You punch one guy, the other guy falls, huh? Somethin' like that. You're slight in the butt. You better not go to prison. Hey, Nick! Nick! Come here for a second. Hop in. I wanna talk to you for a second. How ya doin'? Where you at these days? What are you doin' for pocket money? - I just got a paper route. - Is that right? Your old man is a righteous dude. Taught me everything I know. I could see it, man. You got the bloodlines of a pro. Now I'm lookin' for a back pair of eyes. Pay's good. No risk. I think you're the one. Why me? 'Cause I see somethin' in you. I got a feel for this. I know your old man just got outta the joint. But believe me, he had a lot of fun doin' this. He was good at it too. Think about it. - What's in the T, Mary? - Get your hands out of his pants, Derrick. - Well, is he a he or a she? - I'm a he. - How old are you, nine? - Shit, I'm 15. You don't look but nine. I better not catch you downtown. You're too cute. Show us somethin' you do on the farm, boy. Cop! # Down in the street makin' all that noise # # Don't want no whores on eighth avenue # - Come on, it's your shot. # 'Cause tonight I'm gonna be with you # # 'Cause tonight I'm gonna take that ride # - Did you win? # Cross the river to the Jersey side # Feels like it. # And take my baby to the carnival # # And I'll take you on all the rides # # Down the shore everything's all right # # You with your baby on a saturday night # # Don't you know all my dreams come true # # When I'm walkin' down the street # # With you... # You goin' home to that old jailbird? His girlfriend's probably still there, I bet. You can stay with me if you promise not to rip my mom off. - I owe you a favor. - You don't owe me a favor. Nobody better rip Diane off. My dad, he remarried a long time ago. I've never seen him since. He lives in Tacoma. I know he's got new kids. He has one my age. I wonder if she's like me. Close your eyes. You can't kiss me if you're mad doggin' me. - But I wanna see you. - Why? 'Cause I think you're pretty to look at. Okay! Oh, Molly! Who the hell am I, the old woman in the shoe? Oh, shit. Somebody stole my fucking dress! This time, Molly, I am really gonna kill you. - You don't believe me? -I do. I thought you weren't hanging out with her. She's not our type. - Do you like her? - Yeah, I like her. Okay, so you like her. Is she your first? - What do you mean? - Your first time out. You mean my first time out? Probably. I would say most probably. Now I know what it's like your first time. They can break your heart. But you gotta remember, you're a good-looking kid. You got my looks. You gotta learn to keep your heart. See? Let them lose theirs; you keep yours. That's the trick of bein' a heartbreaker. Did you break my mom's heart? Maybe I did. Why are you telling me all of this? Because that's the way a father and son should be together. I'm just tryin' to do for you what nobody ever did for me. Don't put all your beans in one pot, Nick. There'll be hundreds of dames. She's not a dame. That ain't her first time around. What do you know about her? Hey, I'm just tryin' to keep you straight! You keep me straight; I keep you straight. - Give it here. - Okay, you have to read it. Smells like me. - Return to sender. - Yes. -Okay. - I got that in the mail. "Dear sweet Jack." "It's four in the morning. the rain is pouring down. "I wanna kiss your big mouth... your sweet mouth... your sweet mouth. "and lie down with you under a big, big, big tree... "on wet the mossy ground. on wet the mossy ground. Oh, God. and the droopy violets brush against our nakedness." brush against... - I can't read anymore of this. - Oh, why not? My shorts are too tight. And my kid's around. What do you think of him? I can't tell if it's an actor if he's a sad kid. Yeah, I know what it's like to be 14 and sad. He never really had a mother. # Grab your coat and get your hat # # Take your worries to your doorstep # # Just direct your feet # # To the sunny side of the street # # Don't you hear the pitter-pat # # And that happy tune is yourself # I sang that song to you a long time ago when you visited me in Walla Walla. You and me are goin' north, Nick. But... - You said... - Yeah, I know. I changed my mind. Hey, when it's 50 below in the Klondike, a man needs a partner. Hey, I finally got a rise out of this kid. Here, drink up if you got hair on your ass. Gulp! To Alaska. Hey, don't I rate a beer? Oh, I guess. Here you go. All right, come on. - Okay. - When are we goin' to Alaska, Jack? Well, not tomorrow. Remember that picture of mom? Yeah. She was a model, right? Sort of. Did you ever know your mom? Yeah, for about three hours, and I've never seen her since. How about your dad? What is this, more for your book? My dad was an asshole. Weird, I wish I'd got to know him anyway. When I was born, what did you like about me? You know what I liked about you? Nothin'. How you had a nice laugh when I stole your nose. We didn't see too much of each other. You know what I liked about you? You sang me songs. All right, real easy. I'm gonna go in, get me two beads. Duck as low as you can on the floor. I'll distract them. Just... "Lusty Lady" We run from 11:00 until 3:00 a.m. Yeah, well we... Yeah, go on. We start with ruby at 11:00, end up with raven at 12:30. # Darlin' don't say a word 'cause I already heard # # What your body's sayin' to mine # # I'm tired of fast moves I got a slow groove # # On my mind # # I want a man with a slow hand # # I want a lover with an easy touch # - Mom! # I want somebody who will spend some time # - Get out! # Not come and go in a heated rush # # I want somebody who will understand # # When it comes to love I want a slow hand # - Did you get my dress back, Molly? - Mom! Can we leave Roy here, and can I have some money, mom? Do I look like I have my purse on me? You better get my dress back. Son-of-a-fuckin'-bitch! It ain't my fault. - Was it that guy who isn't a guy, Terry what's-his-name? - I'm not a snitch. You gonna run around all day with your cutie pie, or are you gonna take care of Roy like you're supposed to? Hi. Bubble Gum, what're ya doin'? They're minors. This is totally against house rules. Fuck the rules. What about all this nurturing attitude we're supposed to have? I'm nurturing here. You're not staying with me tonight unless you get my dress back. I am very upset with you, Molly. Nicole, can you get the kids something to drink? Please. And I think there's a popsicle left for Roy. You've got about another minute on your break. You're gonna get me fired. Well I ain't sittin' Roy either. I'm tired of this shit. I need money, mom. I got five more hours left on stage, Molly. How much money do you need? Nothin'. I'll get it. I'd shoot the guys who killed those animals. I'd look filthy in one of them fur coats, - Driving a fast car like a "testaroni" or somethin'. - Homeboy's gettin' the words. Aren't those wicked? Aren't those the prettiest shoes you ever saw? I once showed up in a dress downtown just for the fuck of it. - And nobody recognized me. I looked good too. - Oh, yeah. I want those shoes. I want 'em bad. - You want the butt ugly ones? - I know what's comin' next. Shut up, Freddie! You wouldn't get those for a working girl like me. - Would you, homeboy? - Come on, let's go. What, you really like this cleaning business, Jack? See a future in it? Tell you what. There's no end to dirt. Come on, listen to reason, would you, Jack? Here's the reason. I been walking sideways my whole life. What are you doin'? Remember the good times, Jack? - What are you gonna do for real money, Jack? - This is real money, Rainey. Everything I ever taught you is bullshit. I'm sorry for it. Are you shittin' me, Jack? You got somethin' planned. I know it. If I have to work neck deep in shit for the rest of my life, it's better than jail. It's over, finished. I want you out of my life, get it? Stay away from me. Keep away from us. Keep my name outta your mouth. If that's the way you want it, Jack. - What you got there, Nick? - Nothin'. Give me those. They're mine. What the hell? You a fruiter? No, they're not mine. They're for somebody else. - Where'd you get the money for these? You steal 'em? - My aching ass. Yeah, you did too. For her, right? You could put me back in the joint for this. I'll get rid of 'em. No, I'll get rid of 'em. Fuck! What are you messing with that weed for? Look at me when I'm talking to you! - Marijuana has medicinal purposes. - Oh yeah? How do you know? I read it in a book. That's the biggest bunch of bullshit I ever heard. What else are you doin'? Let me see your arms. Get off my back. I stole them 'cause I'm saving my money for Alaska. Oh, I see. That's real smart. You land in Juvie, I'll go north myself, back to plan A. Where'd you get this? I didn't steal it. I earned it. It's for our tickets. First thing's first. We almost have enough to pay off the landlady to keep her off my back. Another week, we'll make it. Why won't she take half? So she could give us the bum's rush. Nut we ain't gonna let that happen. - You wanna go for a bike ride? - Sure. It's a good thing you're such a shrimp. I don't know when I'm ever gonna grow. When I was your age, I was small. - You were? - Yeah, then I grew to how I am now. Fishermen up there, they're dying for a 'New York steak'. Cruise around in one of these tubs selling steaks and gas at inflated prices. Make a fortune. How's that for a dream? Not bad, huh? Not bad. How much money do we have now? About $200. If we save our pennies we'll make it. Are you gonna come with me when I leave town? Will you come with me to this party? If you come with me when I leave town. - Whereabouts you goin'? - "G-nome." - Where is that? - G-nome, Alaska. I hear there's mass money in Anchorage. You wouldn't be selling yourself. I'd find a straight job, working construction. There's places up there no man has ever set foot. Just wolves and bears. I don't know, maybe. All right now, put your arms like this. - Like this? - No. All right. All right, ready? One, two, three. And down, down, down. We got beat! You see anybody walkin' out with my bike? Our policy is to keep the doors open during business hours. Mr. Kelson, I want the full amount. Can you cut me a little rhythm on that? I can't feed Lisa on rhythm. I just got beat. Just a temporary setback. It'll slide back my way. Mr. Kelson? I want you out of here. I'll get you the money. You all right? Telephone. Hey, Nick? I'm in kind of a situation here. Bring my pants. I'm on the corner of... Whistler and Madison. Jack? Jack! Evicted. Well, that's it. Flat broke. Three days, we'll be hugging the pavement. - It'll be okay. - It's all fucked! You can't give up, Jack. We'll get there. Yeah, after 8,000 more fuckin' windows. What are you talking about? My job, boy. Washin' windows. Washing windows? You said you had a job in construction. You're a building supervisor. So, I lied. Ain't the first time. All you've been doing is lying to me since the day you left me back there in the bus station. Put your mouth in park, thief, and get in your room. I don't have a room. Well, then get out! You're crampin' my style. Where are you goin'? Hey! I'm talkin' to you! You're a fuck-up, and you're gonna fuck me up too! Don't bother with that. It only looks like your mother. She was no model. I'll tell you what she was a whore. A five-dollar street whore! My parents are breathing holy hellfire down my neck. Sure as shit they're gonna call a cop or somethin' if they find you. What you gonna do? I don't know. I can't go back there, Rollie. That's cold your old man threw you out. You're a genius, Nick. You don't deserve this. Wake up before my dad finds you. Brothers forever, man. Aren't you gonna go out there and look for him? He's 14. he's got lessons to learn. Yeah, he's 14. Remember what it was like to be 14 and out on the street? Yeah. he'll be scared, it'll be cold, he'll be hungry, he'll come back. You didn't. You had to get drug back by the authorities. - Just leave it alone. - Is that what you want? He'll come back when he's ready to appreciate how good he's got it. Come back to where? He can't go back to battery street. You could stay at my place. Nick can too. - How's it going? - All right. You have a place to stay tonight? It's terrible. I know how it feels not to have a roof over your head. Look, I have an extra bed. You can stay there. I'd like to help out if I can. My name's Steve. What's yours? Harold. You're a nice-looking kid, Harold. Did that make you uncomfortable? Or did you like it? Hey! I'm sorry. I thought you were somebody else. - You seen Nick? - Nick? Who's Nick? - My kid. Remember? - Oh, yeah, Molly's cutie pie. He's on the streets, too, now, huh? Kids. What are you gonna do? - Wanna get a drink? - No, I'm lookin' for Nick. Talk to Freddie. Everybody down here knows Freddie. If you see Molly, tell her to come home. # Do you wanna touch do you wanna touch, yeah # # Do you wanna touch me there, where # # Do you wanna touch do you wanna touch, yeah # I could've had Barbie do it, but I wanted you. And you're better-lookin' than Cathy. I'll give you 20 more dollars than her. Come with me. Get out of here. Get out of this place. I need to do this. I need the money. I don't wanna go down there to G-nome or whatever. I'm happy with my life here. # My, my, my Whiskey & Rye # # Don't it make you feel so fine # # Uh, uh, uh gonna turn you on # # Can't you see we're wastin' time, yeah # # Do you wanna touch do you wanna touch, yeah # # do you wanna touch me there, where do you wanna touch # There you go. Half a yard each, since you decided to bring a friend. - Fifty bucks? - Beats the minimum wage. That's okay. I didn't do anything, right? I just stood there. That's what a lookoutmdoes, man. There's more where that came from. Next time, come inside; I'll cut you in. - I can't get caught. - Me neither, man. Hey! It's a bird's nest on the ground, man. Hey! Wait a minute, Nick! - Where you been? - Been living. - What've you been doin'? - That's none of your business. - Hey, I'm responsible for you! - Bullshit! Hey! I'm stayin' at Charlotte's! I want you to stay there too. Hey, Jack! Don't do me any favors, remember? - We have to pick ourselves back up. - I'm going to Alaska. Where in the crap have you been? - Where have you been? - I told you, living! - Where? - And when I die, I die! You wanna live out in the street, big tough guy? - Have you gone and seen me sleeping on the streets? - Have you been hustlin'? - And eating on the streets? - Have you been peddlin' your ass? You wa... wait right there! Hey! That's right! Just keep running! Just run away. What are you lookin' at? - What the hell are you doing? - Family problem, sir. This isn't a crisis center. It's a bank. It won't happen again. I said I'm sorry. We could lose customers with this kind of nonsense. - I said, I'm fucking sorry. - What did you say to me? - I said, blow it out your ass. - You're fired. I do a good job here. Hey, you can't take my job away. Charlotte? I was afraid somethin' like this was gonna happen. His mother was a mess. He was comin' along, learnin' stuff. He had a hell of a potential. Tthat kid could've been anything. What happened to him? - He isn't dead. - No, not yet. Why do you think he's out there? He started hanging out with that chippie downstairs and those street punks. Next, he's coming home with a pair of high heels. The rest is history. You don't think filling up that boy's head with dreams, and then kicking him out on his ass had anything to do with it? Hey, when he came to me, he didn't have any dreams! He had nothin'. He had a picture of a pig. Don't pin that rap on me. I'm out there bustin' my hump... while this little wiseass punk is out there thievin'. Gettin' mouthy. I take him in, and he gets mouthy. You miss him. It's all falling apart on me. I wasn't afraid in prison, and now I'm, I'm really scared. I don't know if I can help the kid. I don't know if I have anything good to give him. He needs so much. This is no good. I gotta turn this around, get some money quick. How are you gonna do that? I got my ways. Are we going back to jailhouse correspondence? I gotta split. You should find somebody better than me. You're all right by me. I want to be with you. Shut the door. It's a nice house. Hey, what can we do with this? Is it worth anything? Beats me. Take it. God! Stale. - Your hair's getting kind of long, you know that? - Yeah. You'll have to get a little cut here. Did you just hear something? - No. - Hey, check this out. Hey, goldfish don't have teeth, do they? Yeah they do, look. What are you doing in my room? Freeze. Close the door, boy. - Rollie, put it away. - I'm gonna get my dad! Put it down, Rollie! Jesus! - Look what you did, you big dummy! - You're supposed to keep watch! - You were! You're such a bonehead! What the hell is going on in here? Rollie. Oh, my God! Nick! It's me! Freddie told me you'd be here. What's wrong? Jack, I wanna come home. Hey, what's all the tears? What are you cryin' for? Rollie's dead, and it's my fault. What happened? Me and him, we broke into this house. There was a gun, and this man came in. We were fighting, and the gun went off and Rollie got shot. He's dead. All right. - Listen. people like us, we make a lot of mistakes. - I wish I was dead. You can't roll over and die every time somethin' goes south. You gotta... pick yourself up, get on with life. There's nothin' you can do to bring that boy back. Now listen to me. We're goin' north, okay? You keep me straight; I keep you straight. We'll feel clean up there. we won't have to keep runnin'. See, I never told you, but I used to be a runner, just like you. Now listen, was there anybody who saw you in that house? Anybody that might rat on you? - Rainey. - Rainey? Didn't I tell you to stay away from Rainey? All right. Never mind that now. Here. Now, I want you to get the tickets, and leave one for me. Then get on that ferry and wait for me. I'll meet you there. - I think it leaves around 7:00 or 8:00. - Where are you going? - I got business to take care of. - Don't leave. - I'm not going anywhere. I just gotta go somewhere. - Please don't go. - Please. - I'll meet you on the ferry. Now, can you stay out of trouble from now 'til then? Okay. From here on in, you're all I got. Unfortunately I'm all you got. What's up, Jack? You scared me, man. I thought you were the cops. Where are you goin'? What're you packin' for? You fucker! I kept your ass out of jail! There are a million punks on the street. Why'd you pick on Nick? What are you... Gonna do, Jack, kill me? I told you, you son-of-a-bitch. Come here! Get the fuck out of here! You mother fucker! I'm takin' my end, Rainey. Look out! Get out of my way! Get out of my way! Give me my money! Stop 'im! What do you know, kid, we made it. I've been lookin' all over for you. Give me a hand. I don't feel so good. What's the matter? I never was much of a sailor. - Should I get a doctor? - No, no. stay here. Don't leave. Stick by your dumb old dad. People are gonna tell you you're no good. Don't listen. Whatever's happened, I wanna see you make it up there, little man. Things could be different for you. You won't have to keep runnin'. I did the best I could. I'm not gonna let you off the hook. # Now ring the bell backwards and bury the ax # # Fall down on your knees in the dirt # # I'm tied to the mast between water and wind # # Believe me you'll never get hurt # # My ring's in the pawn shop the rain's in the hull # # Down at the five points I stand # # I'll lose everything but I won't let go of your hand # # Now Peter denied and Judas betrayed # # I played with the roll of your drum # # And the wind will tell the turn from the wheel # # And the watchman's making his rounds # # Will you leave me hanging by the skin of my teeth # # I've only got one leg to stand # # You can send me to hell, but I'll never let go of your hand # # Swing from the rope on a cross and a dream # # Some would watch you explode # # From temple to union to where they have been # # Walkin' back home in the mud # # I must make my best of the only way home # # Mourning is only in stones # # I'm lost on the midway I'm reckless in your eyes # # Just give me a couple more throws # # I'll dare you to dine with a cross late at night # # Dare me to jump and I will # # I'll fall from your grace but I'll never let go of your hand # # I'll never let go of your hand #
