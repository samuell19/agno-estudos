Goal! Neela! - I think the injury is serious. C'mon, Neela. I don't know what happened to my son. - Don't worry mother, ..brother will be all right. Why did he go to watch the hockey match? It's his job, he has to go. And it isn't everyday that you get hit by a ball, just today. Is there any internal injury, Prem? How am I to know? I'm a lawyer not a doctor. I'm sorry! Nurse, the patient is my brother in law. This is the patient's mother and this is his sister my wife, Suman. Alok, I mean the patient. - Wait for some time, ..you'll know everything. Thank you, nurse. Now please calm down, mother. Poor Alok, he was always a weak child. One day, Alok fell off from the kitchen roof. Mother, don't start the same old story again. - When was this? They were kids then, we used to live in Baroda. Both the siblings were playing hide and seek on the terrace. When Suman pushed Alok off the terrace. When did I push? Alok, don't run, I won't catch you. Let's go downstairs and play. No, I'm a thief. I know how to jump. Just like in the movies. I'll get the umbrella, wait. Watch me jump. Hey.. Alok forgot to open the umbrella while jumping. Was that my fault? Tell me something, did he get hurt anywhere? He was in the hospital for 2 months. He had hurt his backbone. What was the disease, Suman? Compressed vertebrae. Vertebra, the backbone. Thankfully, doctor Bannerjee, ..whom we knew already. Else.. - Mother! The backbone. What's it, Prem? The plot is now ready. - What plot? Just wait and watch. Are you planning to trap someone again? Alok! Alok, son. Alok, son. It's your mother. Suman and Prem are here too, have a look. Son! How is he? - Nothing to worry about. It's a minor wound. We've given him sleeping pills. Come! No! I'm.. - He doesn't even recognize his mother. Doctor, one minute. Has he broken any bones, the backbone? I don't think so. You don't think so! How long are you practicing? Since the last 6 months. Six months, you're very experienced! Let's go. Listen, where are you taking him? To the general ward. - General ward? He should be kept in the special room. And there should be a nurse round the clock. After all, he is my only brother in law. Tell the admission office what you want. What you want will be done. C'mon. What's the need for a special ward? Where'll we get the money from? We'll get it. Alok's paper will give it to us. Why? Because Alok's backbone is injured. Compressed vertebra! Will they tear my son apart? Suman, take mother home. Aren't you coming? - No. All right, come early for dinner. - Why don't you understand? I'm not only Alok's brother in law but also his lawyer. How can I leave him alone in this condition? Leave now. - C'mon, mother. Good morning! - Good morning! 213962 Midweek? I'd like to speak to your chief editor, Mr. Barucha. Prem Sagar, I'm your staff photographer Alok Prakash's brother in law. Good morning, sir! I'm Alok Prakash's lawyer speaking. He is very serious, sir. His case is getting very complicated. It's uncertain whether he will survive or not. He is now in Essel hospital in the special ward. Yes. It's obvious that you'll be paying the hospital bills. But sir, the purpose behind my call is altogether different. On behalf of Alok Prakash, I'm suing your paper for 2 million. Because this accident took place during his office duties, ..it's obvious you'll be paying the compensation. It was my duty to inform you hence I've done it. And I'm going to give this news to the Indian Times too. All right then, I'm in a bit of hurry. At present Alok's condition is very serious and so is mine. Bye. Hello, please call up Mr. Rungta. Thank you. Yes Barucha, who is this Alok Prakash? A claim of 2 million! Is he mad? And look Barucha, ..our paper already has to fight three defamation cases, ..two court cases, ..the usual government issues and now this 2 million claim! I'll close down the newspaper, Barucha! Indian Times? It's our enemy. They'll sensationalize the story. I don't want to hear anything. I won't give a single penny. Call up our lawyer, Desai. It seems Alok Prakash is going to win. This time I'm going to lay such a trap, ..that I'll strike all the pins down in one go. Whom are you striking? Yourself or Alok? Suman, this is the only thing that upsets me. You've still not understood your husband. I'll lay a trap for Midweek newspaper, ..and it's owner Mr. Rungta. The only thing I'm worried about is that your brother, ..will spill the beans. Nothing should happen to Alok. He's a simple guy. He's the one who'll get it. He'll become a millionaire! Really? Yes. - How much will he get? About, 2 million. - 2 million! And we? - We will get half. 1 million! Then we'll buy that sari with golden work, ..which we had seen at that sari store. Yes, we'll buy that too. But first we'll buy a beautiful car. Imported! These darn buses and cabs waste half our time. And these autos give you a lot of bumps. If only Alok keeps supporting me. Excuse me. Yesterday an injured press photographer was admitted here, Mr. Alok Prakash. - This isn't the time to meet patients. Come in the evening, 4 to 6. Hello! I won't be able to come in the evening. We have a hockey match. I'm the captain of the Gymkhana club. It was my ball that injured Mr. Alok. Hello Kishore! Go to room number 12 upstairs. - Thank you! You're welcome. - C'mon. Hello Kishore, listen to me. I'm free this evening after 5. Yes. Look, it says no visitors allowed. Let's go back. - Wait. Since we're here, let's meet him. We'll sit there. Come, Preeti. Yes? Is Mr. Alok Prakash in this room? - Yes, tell me. I called up twice yesterday but I couldn't find anything. How is he? - I can't say anything. I've just come in for duty. He's asleep right now. Let him sleep then, I'll wait outside. Please tell me, when he wakes up. Who was that girl? She's waiting outside, go and ask her. Often on television, one sees beautiful nurses in the hospital. Where are those? Nurse, will you please go outside? I want to speak with him alone. I'm not only his relative but also his lawyer. Look. Take the whole paper with you. You can read it outside. How are you, Alok? How did I get here? The ambulance and the hospital stretcher got you here. God! Why's my head feeling so heavy? Just continue lying down quietly. There's no need to get up at all. Where are you going? To the toilet. - No. I said keep lying down. You aren't going anywhere. Why shouldn't I go anywhere? Because you've injured your backbone very seriously. What? - Yes. And your left leg has been paralyzed. And three fingers of your right hand are numb. What rubbish? My fingers are fine. My leg is fine too. Then.. - Shut up. Ok. But being just fine would cause a loss of 2 million. Whose 2 million? - Listen to me first. Alok, after thinking a lot, I've concluded, ..we won't get such a good opportunity again in our lives. Something that would make us millionaires. This boss of yours, Mr. Rungta. 2 million for him is a very measly amount. He'll give it immediately to avoid disrepute. Have you gone mad? What disrepute? Why would someone give you 2 million? What's the harm in trying? - But what will you try for? These are all legal matters. You won't understand. Ok, you aren't injured. It isn't important to get injured, ..but it's important to prove that you're injured. Just keep doing as I say. Everything will be fine. We just have to prove it. You move, I've to go to the toilet. Why are you taking so much trouble? I'll bring the toilet pot right here. Prem, why are you doing such crazy stuff? Yes, try to remember everything one more time. Your backbone is seriously injured. Three fingers on your right hand are numb. And your left leg doesn't move. Prem, I don't.. - One more thing. You should always see double. - See what? Double, one as two and two as four. How many of me can you see now? - One, only one. A shrewd, cheating lawyer and who's a failure. And who's unfortunately my sister's husband. Great, amazing thoughts! And that too for the man, ..who's offering you millions on a marble platter. Neither do I want your millions, ..nor your silver platter. Brother in law, does money bite you? But why do…But why are you worried? I have to do everything. And as soon as the money comes.. This nurse is such a pain. Good morning, sir. Good morning. Yes? Nurse said that Mr. Alok has woken up, so I.. Can you read this? It means no one can meet him. The patient needs complete rest. How is he feeling now? He's very serious. Give me this bouquet. I'll give it to him. What's your name? - Neela. Do you work in his office? - No. Actually, it was my ball that injured him during the match. I'm the captain of the Gymkhana hockey club. I see. I think the nurse has misinformed you. He's sleeping. Give me this bouquet, I'll give it to him. Never mind, I'll come later. Tell him that.. - Yes, I'll tell him. Prem. - Somebody is here! Where are my clothes? - Why? I'm leaving. - Where? Home. - Home! I think he's very serious. They aren't letting me in. - Let's go then. I'm feeling very bad. It's my fault, he is.. - The ball hit him, how's it your fault. I don't know. My ball has never hurt anybody. - He could get better soon too. And what if he doesn't? He was saying he's very ill. Where are my clothes, Prem? Look, Alok. Look at present circumstances and think about them carefully. First and foremost, think about Shobha. Your wife! Why did she leave you? Because she wanted a husband who earned well. Then your mother. Suffering from asthma, blood pressure, ..who works all day just because she can't afford a servant. Then take your sister, I mean my wife. The poor woman still hasn't seen a real diamond set. Ok, on her last birthday, to please her, I did, ..give her a fake diamond necklace. But how long will I keep giving her false hopes? Now, your mother, sister, your two little nephews and me. All five of us, sleep in one dingy 10 feet by 12 feet room. Don't you feel for your mother? Don't you feel brotherly love? Don't you feel an uncle's love? Don't you feel a brother in law's love? Do you want us to live all our lives like insects? And what do you want? That I spend my life in jail. In my presence? Let 50 doctors come and examine you. If you say once that you've back pain, it's the final word. Even I'm a lawyer. I'll see which doctor can prove that you're all right. Yes, I forgot to tell you the most important thing. There'll be no tax charged on the money we'll get. But listen.. - Yes, tax free! The doctor's coming with the X-ray. Get ready please. Nurse have you read the newspaper? Heard? They're getting an X-ray. And you were dreaming! Dear, the injury of the vertebra is such, ..it's difficult to find out whether the injury is new, ..else twenty years old. We'll just say, ..that the injury occurred on the hockey ground. Compressed vertebra! Nobody will believe, got it? Look. Your bosses will never let the case go to the courts, ..because they already have many cases against them. And even if this case does go to the court, ..the moment the magistrate sees you in a wheel chair.. Wheel chair? - Yes, wheel chair. And a cervical support on your neck, I mean a belt. The belt is to prevent your bone from any pressure. Prem, you're.. - It's just a matter of a few days. After we get the money, slowly, steadily, ..you'll get cured. Not slowly, immediately. I'm fine. What are you doing? The doctor's coming, lie down. Go and fool someone else. I won't get conned by you. Lie down, else.. Who is it? - Me. Hello, Shobha! Alok, your wife is here. - I've no wife. Ok the one you divorced, your ex-wife. She's here to see you. Come Shobha, Alok is calling you inside. How are you Alok? He had a narrow escape. The vertebra is severely injured. I read it all in the Indian Times. You are asking for compensation? We have to. How's Alok now? If you take care of him he'll get well. Poor Alok, I'm so sorry. Why have you come here? What business do you've here? I'm here just to know, how you are. Where was all this sympathy, a year back, when you left me? You left only two pieces of bread in the kitchen. I had to spend an entire month wearing the same shirt. Because I had no idea, which laundry you gave my clothes to. Please Alok, everyone makes mistakes. My salary was just Rs. 1200. How could you survive on it? You needed, Rs. 1,000 for that stupid music teacher! Ok, I left you. But you could've dragged me back. Why did you remain a gentleman? You could've beaten me. Yes, I could've beaten you too! Is it so easy to beat wives these days? No Shobha, don't mind Alok's words. He's sick, you see. He has hurt his vertebra. Maybe it has affected his brains too. Maybe! He isn't aware of what he is saying. The doctor will get the report now. I'll tell you everything then. Maybe you're getting late and he needs some rest too. Ok, Alok. His fingers on the right hand have become numb. He can't shake hands. Ok, Alok. God knows what I saw in Shobha that I married her. She can't cook, can't run the house! All she does the whole day is play the harmonium! It seems you haven't forgotten her yet. Get lost, haven't forgotten! Is it the truth? You think Shobha was the only girl in my life? There were so many. Rekha, Hema, Reena! The fingers on this hand are numb. Use the other one. I'm not that dumb. Look, she still loves you. Didn't you see the way she was crying? You can bring her back. Just act sick like this and she'll come everyday to see you. This is the only way you'll win back your wife. She didn't come all this time, how will she come now? Listen, I know you're still in love with her. You'll never get a golden chance like this. Yes! Just keep doing as I ask you to do. You'll get your wife and your money too. Prem, will Shobha ever come back? - Of course. Do you know, what she did when I told her you were hurt? What? - She started crying. Why did you tell the poor girl then? If I hadn't, how would she have come here? Good morning! - Good morning! I'm doctor Bhaskar, not Baster. How are you? Good. - Good, means he had a good night's sleep. Those sleeping pills.. - X-ray! Thank you! Sister, lower the bed. What's wrong Alok? My back! Raise the bed, quickly. Sister! - Quickly! Is the pain getting worse? Of course it will. It's a spinal injury. Compressed vertebra! Are you speaking the truth Dr. Baster? Bhaskar. Do you doubt it? No, Why would I doubt you Dr. Baskar? Then stop your chattering! Tell me if it pains or not, right? Doctor, do it gently. What if his neck bone.. Didn't I ask you to stop chattering? Prem. Can he smoke, doctor? - Yes. Will you have one? - No, I've quit smoking. Very good doctor! Even I tried a lot.. Why are you smoking this way? Doctor, other fingers have gone numb. - What? Fingers have gone numb! - Chattering again! Doctor anyone would chatter in such a situation! It's a backbone injury and, ..the fingers are numb. How? - So what? All bones are linked to the backbone. And nerves too. - Is it? Just imagine, if a train runs over a wrist watch, ..what will happen to it's wheel, spring balance and other parts? I'm really fortunate that my watch still beats properly. All right. Now tell me where it pains more, ..and where it's less. - Yes, doctor. Here? - Less. Here? - Less. Here? - A lot. A lot! We often get these kinds of injuries. The doctor of our club, Mr. Date is very good. He has a degree from America. Ok, please go outside. Aren't you Neela Paul, the Gymkhana club's captain? - Yes. I've brought these flowers for you. - Thank you. Ok then, you can now.. What was the result of the match that evening? We won by 3 goals. But they were all before half time, ..when you were there. Nothing after that. I had so many chances later. But I don't know why I couldn't score any goals later. How sad? Enough, now stop chattering. Right, doctor? You leave. No smoking. Have you ever hurt your back before? Earlier, on the back.. - I mean in your childhood. The phone's ringing since so long, ..why don't you pick it up? - What? Yes, it's ringing since so long. Can't you hear? How many nurses are present here? Two. Prem, can we really afford two nurses? Doctor, do you still feel this case is a simple one? Shut those curtains. - I'll do it. Open your eyes wide and look at that girl. No, just keep looking there. C'mon. Open those curtains. - Yes. Has he been affected mentally? Will he go insane? No matter what, please be honest with me. I'll bear it. He has got a simple jolt. 4-5 days rest will cure him. Thank god! He'll be all right. But how can he? I mean you said all the bones are linked to the backbone ..and the nerves too. Who knows, where he has been affected? You! - Toilet.. Hey You.. What happened to you? My leg! What is wrong with my leg, doctor? As if I have no leg! Nurse put him on the bed, quick! - My leg! Careful, slowly. Careful. Lie down. Look, Dr. Bhaskar, I don't want to chatter anymore. But this case looks very serious. I'm really sorry, believe me, I didn't want to hurt you in any way. I've never hurt anybody in my entire life. Even though to those who play unfairly. Doctor, if you listen to a layman's opinion.. I don't need a layman's opinion. Sister, please note down. It seems the backbone is hurt elsewhere too. Ask for Doctor Nanavati's opinion. I need some more X-rays, encephalographs, EMG ..and get a tape too. That's it for now. Yes. The patient shouldn't move from the bed. He needs complete rest. Good day! - Good day! Before these flowers wither, will you please.. Bye! - Bye! Good performance, thanks a lot. Now rest assured you'll get back your wife, Shobha. Come in. Come, Mr. Magan, you've come at the right time. You've come so late! You've come so late! This is our boss, Mr. Rungta, the owner of our newspaper. And this is our lawyer, Mr. Desai. - Hello. So what news have you brought for us? Sit down. Alok Prakash draws a salary of Rs. 1200. He's a staff photographer in your newspaper. He owns a nice flat in Khar. One bedroom hall. He was married to a girl called Shobha. But he got divorced within a year. Now he lives all alone. He has just one sister and a mother, His mother's married.. Sister's married. And mother lives with her daughter. Any history of fraud? No. According to our agency's investigation, ..he has never cheated anybody. In fact, it's others who have used him. Alok Prakash is a very simple man. - A simple man? Where did you get this idiot from? That man has claimed 2 million! Do you know? - Yes sir, we know, ..he has claimed 2 million. Do you think 2 million is a measly amount?! - No sir, ..it's a huge amount. There are 3 more cases against the newspaper. If I lose, I'll lose 5 million! Sir, please don't worry at all. We'll do our best to protect your newspaper. To hell with the newspaper. You protect my money! Sir, we'll protect your money too. We've got all the papers from Essel hospital. Mr. Magan is no ordinary man. He had revealed all about the Phoolvati murder case. Fine then, but if we lose any of these cases, ..your newspaper's finished. I've many other businesses. Yes Mr. Magan, please continue. Alok Prakash's sister's husband is Prem Sagar. What name did you say? - Prem Sagar. He is the one handling the case. - Who is this Prem Sagar? So have you brought my fees? How much is the fees, lawyer? - Rs. 100. Please keep Rs. 50 now. I'll pay the rest after the case. Please sir, as a favour. This charity has become a pain for me. So tell me, how did you break your leg? Not my leg but the bone on my elbow. Yes, so how did your backbone.. Not backbone but the elbow bone, sir. You broke some bone, right? - Yes. Tell me how. I was passing through Linking Road. On the footpath, else on the road? The road, sir. - Go on. Look at this. What's this? A banana peel. I stepped on it and slipped. All right, keep it with you safely, it may come in handy. - Yes. Where did you fall exactly? Exactly opposite Gazebo restaurant. That was bad. Mr. Lawyer, there's such pain in the back, you know? It's sad that you fell in front of the Gazebo. Had you fallen a little ahead, near Kapoor Lamps. - Yes. You could've got lots of money. - Really! Yes. Has the phone call come or not? How strange, the call hasn't come yet. Fall and show me. - What? You had fallen, right? Show me how. - Yes. Get our doctor to check that Alok Prakash. I'm sure he's faking it. But for that we'll have to take his lawyer's permission. So what's the problem? Get it. Barucha. - Yes sir? Call him up. Hello, please give the phone to Prem Sagar. Midweek's call, didn't I say he will call? Put him on. Good morning, Mr. Barucha. I'm fine. She is fine too, how are you? I heard you had some gout trouble recently. Ok that's cured now. Yes, how can I help you? Yes, Alok Prakash's case, yes, I'm handling it. I can't discuss that on the phone right now. There are too many people present here in the office. Where are you calling from? From Mr. Rungta's office. It's very close to my office. If you say, I'll come there. Your barrister Desai is there too. Good. Very good. I'll be there in 5 minutes, all right. How much money will I get? Nothing at all. But it was good that you came here. I'll get you something. From where? I can't say that exactly. But we'll trap someone. Prem Sagar is always on the prowl to trap somebody. If a finger's cut, he'll say both hands are cut. When he comes, we should be lenient. What lenient? Be harsh. Of course, we've a job at hand. We'll act strictly. After shaking hands with him, ..do count your fingers. I think it won't be right for me to stay here. Ok Mr. Magan, you leave. Inspect Alok's case. I won't pay you if anything goes wrong. Rest assured it's my job to investigate. Hello Mr. Magan, whom are you uprooting today? Is everything all right? - Well, you can say that. Go on! Yes sir? I'd like to meet Mr. Rungta, editor Barucha and advocate Desai. Who are you? - Prem Sagar and Prem Sagar. Please go in. They are all waiting for you. Thank you, dear. And yes, you are free to go home after lunch today. Good morning Mr. Rungta. You know him, Barucha, my editor. - Hello! And this is Desai, my lawyer. - Hello. Hello! Does all three of you have an office like this, ..else do all of you sit here together? Mr. Prem Sagar, we had to ask you to come here because.. You want to decide. - Decide what? You don't want to decide? - Of course not. All right then. It's decided. Mr. Prem Sagar, it's possible that you've a strong case.. Barucha shut up! Your case is very weak. It's weak, surely. This is just a labour compensation case. But.. - Yes? Look mister, Alok was injured while he was working for you. And that too such an injury that he may have to remain, ..handicapped forever. This isn't just a case for compensation. 2 million is a small price for your problem. What nonsense? All aspects, of this case are in our favour. In your favour? Did you hear about the Haripal versus Kanchanjunga building case? What's the case? All India Reporter, Delhi edition part 16, year 1976, ..page 208 clearly states. On the 10th floor, a worker, ..was cleaning the glass of a window. The plank on which he was standing suddenly broke, ..and the worker.. Haripal Singh was cleaning the glass of a window. Obviously it was a risky job. He must've got a fair compensation.. The man who was cleaning the glass was Suleiman. Haripal Singh was the name of a passer-by. The poor guy was just going to work, ..passing through Barakhamba Road. Suddenly people saw that he was knocked out. Just 4 days after the incident, ..the man's widow filed a case. She got a compensation of 1 million! The case went in appeal which was rejected. That case is quite different from ours. No difference at all. People in Delhi have lots of money for charity. - Ok. Take the case of Shanodevi vs. Indian Railways. All India Reporter, part 3, page 340, 1965. Shanodevi was going from Ambala to Allahabad, ..to see her dying father. Due to a dysfunctional latch on the train's toilet door, ..it couldn't open. And poor Shanodevi was stuck inside. That coach joined some other train, ..and Shanodevi reached Hyderabad, not Allahabad. By then her father died and her name vanished from his will. Shanodevi then sued the Indian Railways. Do you know, for how much? I've never heard about this case. - This was expected of you. Haven't you all heard about it too? For now, it'd be better if we concentrate, on the Alok Prakash case. - With pleasure! Have you seen the hospital report? Is something wrong? No, it's proper. But.. - Rubbish! I don't believe this report at all. Me too. - Neither do I. We want our doctor to examine the patient. That's exactly, what I wanted! If you refuse, we'll get a court order for the check up. Mr. Desai, he agrees to our.. - Barucha! I'm telling you, I completely agree with you. Don't try any tricks on us. We know you very well. What do you mean, you agree? I mean, if you want your doctor to test the patient, go ahead. You've no objections at all? No, I have no objections at all. In fact, I want that too. This is just a matter of few rupees to you. But for me it's a very tragic story. Alok is my one and only brother in law. He is my wife's brother! Maybe, he'll remain handicapped all his life. I'm sure the doctors who examine him, ..are specialists and experts in their field. And ordinary people like us can never afford their high fees. Sir, I would in fact want you to send Alok to America. And get him examined in that hospital in Houston, ..where our president, Gyani Zail Singh was operated. You don't worry. Alok will be taken care of. After all he's our employee. I'm really happy to hear this. I've full faith in your assurance. Anything else? For now, I don't think there's anything else we want. Yes, you do want my written consent to examine the patient. Sure we do, that's not a big deal. Send a steno. There's no need for that. - Don't send. I've already prepared the letter of consent. Actually, you need just 2 copies but I've brought 3. Thank you. Desai, give it here! Ok sir. I'm in a hurry, I'll leave now. A client of mine is waiting for me. Interesting case. I should drag the Crawford Market Banana Association. Before selling bananas they must warn their customers, ..to throw the banana skin in the dustbin. Else it can prove fatal. What say? Ok. Good day. Good morning, Alok! - Good morning! I've brought some stuff from your house. You may need it here. A pair of slippers, ..a night suit.. - For how long do I've to stay here? They want some special doctors to examine you. Then, back home. I don't know why I listened to you! For this. Where did you find this? - Exactly where you had kept it. Top of the cupboard, inside the cookie tin. Prem, remember 26th of July? It was raining so heavily. Yes and in that rain you two took my car, ..and left for Panchgani. Midway, your car broke down. Both of us pushed the car while getting wet. Since that day my car has gone for repairs, ..and hasn't yet returned. After dropping your car at the garage, we went all over Panchgani. Shobha and me. "In the journey of life, the moment I found you," "it seems I found everything in life." "In the journey of life, the moment I found you," "it seems I found everything in life." "Now the heart flies all the time on the wings of music." "Now the heart flies all the time on the wings of music." "Ever since I met you, my songs, .. have become even more melodious." "In the journey of life,” "I never imagined, I would find so much happiness." "I never imagined, I would find so much happiness." "Finding myself in your arms has given me all I could've asked for." "In the journey of life, the moment I found you," "it seems I found everything in life." “I found everything in life.” Why hasn't Shobha come? You said, she'll come daily. She'll come or maybe not. What do you have to do with her now? Maybe she'll come here running any moment now. There she is near the door. And there she knocks on the door. Come in. What's that on your neck? Ask your husband. I've brought you some cooked pulses and scrambled eggs. Why do you always bring boring food for him? I've ordered special Chinese food for him. - Chinese! I'll eat here it too! No, everything will be ruined. You leave. But this food? - You eat it. As long as I'm here, you don't worry about him. Do one thing, take this key. I've bought a new Mercedes. Here. New Mercedes? Not me, you have. Because you can't drive it right now I'm using it. But where did my car come from? By the way, which is your favourite color? Red. - Red. I'm sorry Alok, don't mind but I haven't bought a red car. I've bought.. What a coincidence? Suman is wearing the exact colour sari as the car. It's a Banarasi sari. Prem, this imported car and the Banarasi sari. Where did the money come from? - On credit. These days I command great prestige in the market. What prestige? The 2 million that you're going to get. Until we get the money, this expense.. Expenses! Dear these days whether they have money or not, ..who doesn't spend? Look at our government. It's spending millions. You think it has so much money? No! I believe in the same motto too. Credit today, cash tomorrow! How did Shobha's photo come here? They are still in love with each other. Alok don't repeat the same mistake again. Look what she has already done to you. Damn it, when will you women use your brains? He is still lying here so that Shobha comes here regularly. Till he stays here, ..we can enjoy the car and the sari. Take this and go. Suman, Shobha is coming here now. Don't utter nonsense. Hello! - Damn it. This is Neela, she is a good hockey player. This is Suman, my sister. - Hello. Hello, I've brought a very nice gift for you. You will love it. The whole team has contributed to this gift. Why did you bother? This is automatic and also has brake. If you loosen it's lever, it spins around too, look. Great, it's amazing! And I've brought a new thing. Look, just attach this to your handle. And whenever you need something, just.. Get well soon. Get well! Why? Yes. He'll get well. But please leave from here. This is the time table for the special doctor's examination. Doctor Inder, will start his examination at 4 pm. Electro-mammogram at 4. Dynamometer test at 5. Mildogram at 7. Excuse me. And why is this place crowded? The visiting hours are in the evening. Suman didn't you hear what the nurse said? Leave. C'mon, hurry up. And you, Ms. Bouquet. I guess you too heard the nurse, now leave. Why is the special doctor after him? Needlessly troubling him. We are fighting for a huge amount. In any case, these days you can't trust people at all. They try to extort money by making false cases. False cases? No, he'll never do such a thing. And anybody who does it must be taught a lesson. You know as a child, I had a similar horn on my cycle. - Really? Goodbye! Bye. - Bye! Thank you and your friends for this vehicle. This was our duty. When you're all right at least this will remind you of us. Bye! - Bye! This girl, what's her name? - Neela. Yes Neela, it would be nice if you stay away from her. Why? She's a nice, simple girl. That's the problem. We don't need innocent, nice, simple people. Mister, what the hell are you doing? Just moving my limbs to improve blood circulation. Else the legs may really stop moving! Just wait, stop! There's no need for us to improve blood circulation. We must immediately lie down. Why are you saying 'we' for everything? Because we are equal partners in this business. Fifty-fifty. - What fifty-fifty? I mean half-half. And that too, because you're my relative. Look, I'm giving 90 per cent of my time to this case. And what's my share? Only 50 per cent. And if you goof up and we lose the case, I won't get 50 per cent but this. Lie down. Is this the time to come? Is this your service? A man is starving here. Anyway! Great, Chinese food! What's this? - Fried rice, fried prawns, ..chicken chow mow. - Good! Where's the tea? You forgot the tea, damn! Nurse, get a cup of tea. Kindly! Will you kindly get a cup of tea? - That's it! Is this your chicken chow chow? With this injection, you'll sail through the doctors' test. I won't let a waiter to give me an injection, got it? Waiter! He is the famous doctor Gogi Anand. Your newspaper guys think they are too smart. They have no idea that I'm more than a match for them. Go on. - Doctor, please be careful while injecting. I'll have to be careful. I'm on parole from Yervada jail, ..else I'll be back in jail. Yervada jail? Yes, it's nearby, in Poona. At the Mahalakshmi race course, I was caught injecting a horse. Is he a veterinarian? No, he's actually a dentist. But dentists are doctors too. Where do you want the injection? On the right hand and the left leg. Both of them should go numb, lifeless. Lifeless! Hurry up, the hypnotist will be here anytime. What's the hypnotist for? A hypnotist is needed before every big test. Inject him. Right one! Inject him in a place, where he has a mole. So that there are no marks left. Did you find one? Found one. Just relax! What if this injection goes wrong? Simple, we'll frame the hospital for it! Saying they use dirty needles for injecting. Doctor, quick, now the leg, the left one. Left one. - C'mon, hurry up. Please lie down. Doctor, quick, the nurse is coming this way. I'm looking for a black mole. Do you have savouries? No, well forget it. I don't want tea, take it. What insolence is this? - I'm sorry. There's fifty less here. - Come later. Hello, Dr. Sarang here. Press this please. Ok. Do you feel anything? Yes, I do. - What? The phone is ringing. That's a mole. 'We have to decide,' 'if the patient's back and his nerves are really hurt,' 'else he's faking it.' 'After our tests and investigation, our opinion,' 'is that we couldn't decide anything.' 'We also provide this bill for our services and other costs incurred.' 'In all, the amount is Rs. 15,677 and 35 pence.' 'We hope our bill is paid at the earliest.' Nonsense! Rs. 15,677 worth of nonsense! Our case has attracted a lot of publicity. People are now aware of the situation. I think, we must compromise with Prem Sagar. Compromise! A compromise on a completely false case! Never! Sir, it isn't just a question of money, ..but the prestige of our newspaper too. And that too, a fraud like Prem Sagar should.. - Desai! Don't you remember? I lost 300,000 in the defamation case in Hyderabad. How much will you make me lose? You have ruined me! You two have disgraced me! Barucha! - Yes sir? Call up Prem Sagar. - Yes sir. Sir, should I keep the waist tight? - Loose. It will grow now. Hello, put him on. Hello, Mr. Barucha. Today? Today it's difficult for me to leave office and come. My tailor's taking my measurements today. And just like me, my tailor's very busy too. – 31. When I give him the appointment, he's busy. And when he gives me the appointment I'm busy. We have finally met after 2 months. They won't leave me today! The courts will drag this case for months now. I mean, why don't we come to a settlement? Stitch a matching jacket for this and a bow tie. - Ok. I'm sorry, what were you saying? To compensate for your charges we can give your client, ..an amount of around.. Should I say 100,000? - 100,000! 10,000. We'll pay 10,000. Ok? It'll be fine but not enough at all. As per my calculations, the amount is a lot more. Say around 2 million. 2 million! 2 million! Give it here. Are you crazy, master Prem? Does money grow on trees? Do you know how much 2 million is? - Hello, sir! Sir, why are you getting furious? There are already 3-4 cases against your company. I'm not saying anything impractical. You said 10,000, I said 2 millions. Now, I'll come a bit lower and you climb a bit higher. 1 million? I'm sure Alok's act won't last long. He'll be caught one day. Alok is leaving the hospital tomorrow. If you wish, I can start my 'People's Plan' tomorrow. What's that? A strict vigilance on Alok. Hidden microphones. A tape recording of all his conversation. And using small, 8 mm cameras, ..a complete picture of his activities through the day. Entire day's?! So that he freely dances at night?! No, this'll not work. Think of another plan. Then why don't you take our 'Labyrinth plan'? 'Labyrinth plan'? What's that? A hidden microphone in every room. 35 mm camera with zoom lens. A watch on his activities round the clock. In Eastman colour. Do you want something? Just stop that song you're humming. Sorry. I've kept your clothes in the bathroom. Leave these clothes there too. Don't you have that today? Your hockey practice? I do but I won't be going. I've so many chores here too. Good morning! - Hello! I've packed up all the stuff here. I don't think you and your wheel chair, ..will fit into the Mercedes. We have a station wagon in our club. - Look I.. Please don't say no, I'll just get it. - Listen.. I'll be back in 5 minutes. Now that's weird! Better stay away from this pain. She is showing too much concern. - What can I do about it? Should I tell her I'm fine? I'm acting because of you? Not because of me but because of Shobha. What the hell are you doing? The door's open, someone will see. I don't care. - Alok! I'm leaving, Prem. On my two feet and without this damn collar! Have you lost your mind? Have you gone mad? After doing so much? They are almost ready to compromise. Have you seen Neela? Have you seen how what our fraud has done to her? She still thinks she's guilty. She thinks I'm handicapped because of her. I'll be on this chair all my life because of her! I don't want a decent girl like Neela to.. Do you want Neela or Shobha? - Stop your rubbish! You know why Shobha left you? Because you're a complete dumb ass. Idiot! Coward! A fool! Don't know why your X-rays didn't show all this. Who's it? - Alok. It's Shobha. I'll go and change. Hello Shobha! - Hello! How's Alok doing? He does relapse occasionally but the doctors say, ..he'll recover slowly. Why don't you come daily? - Is he depressed? Why wouldn't he be depressed? Don't you remember our deal? It's so difficult to come everyday. What do I tell you? Don't you want Alok to benefit? Get some money? - Why not? With you around, he'll surely get it. And as long as you're here I'm sure he will get it. Alok needs a lawyer like me and a wife like you. Come along. Hello Shobha, suddenly today.. I've come to see you. I wanted to come earlier too, ..but feared if you'd talk to me. The last time I came, you were so angry. You didn't even speak nicely to me. Due to the drugs, ..don't know what I said that day. It's good, Shobha that you're here. I'm leaving the hospital today. Where are you going? I don't know. Wherever Prem takes me. Why? You could come to our flat. You remember our old flat? How could I forget it? We had gone there after our marriage. Those three wooden swans on the wall. The sofa set we had brought from the scrap dealer. And our sweet cat, Shabnam. Everything is still the same, exactly the same. Those swans are still there. That worn out sofa is still there. Only the cat has run away. Maybe I wasn't good enough. Why do you say that? Maybe Shabnam wasn't good enough, right? What if I stay with you till you recover fully? My answer would always be yes. But you may have your own compulsions. Shobha, of late I don't know anything about you. You decide if you have a problem or.. No Alok, I'll stay with you. What's the problem in staying with you? I'm leaving now, good night. Goodnight Shobha! Bye Prem and thanks. Shabnam is coming back. Thank you Prem. Goodbye hospital. What's happening? 1, 2, 1, 2. See what's happening. I said see what's happening. Bhangra dance! - What? Is the lame man dancing? - Yes. Dancing! Move! Look. C'mon! 1, 2. Very good. C'mon, 1, 2. C'mon. Is this Bhangra dance? - Yes. Is this Bhangra dance? - Yes. Is this the time to joke? - No. Mr. Magan, I think we're just wasting our time. I think that guy is genuine. He could be genuine but our job is to investigate. Got it! Spying! Mr. Magan, that girl dresses him up with her own hands. Goes to the bathroom with him, lays him on the bed. Later even feeds him passionately. And you think he's acting? Look Johnny, once I was after a man for three months. I observed for three months, a woman used to massage him daily. But do you know what I suddenly saw one day? - What? The man was massaging the woman. - Really? Yes, he was caught red handed. But our former camera man, whom you've replaced. What's his name? - Nandu, go on. The idiot got so engrossed in watching the massage, ..that he forgot to switch on the camera. Mr. Magan, you should've said, ..once more, take two. I've arranged everything and the committee people have agreed too. You're coming to the Gymkhana ground on the 27th. What for? We have a match there. Gymkhana club vs. India 11. Alok Prakash Benefit match, just for you. No. - What no? You'll watch our match with the committee members. You'll be introduced to our players during half time. After which a small speech from you, that's it. No Neela, thank you very much. No need for all that. Why not? Aren't you doing enough for me already? Yes, I'm doing very little? Ok? Are you married? I was but my wife divorced me. Did she divorce you? You can say that. - Why? Shobha loves singing. She sings nicely too. She wanted to be a playback singer in the film industry. In the course of that she met a music director. He must've praised her, given her hopes. That he'd do something. He'd make a star singer. And then all she could think of was singing. She used to often go out of town. Madras, Calcutta. God knows where else. Then we started drifting away from each other. Actually Shobha loves money, fame, fancy cars, ..parties and luxuries. I couldn't fulfill these needs. Then we got separated. Did she remarry? - I don't know, maybe not. Do you want your wife to come here? Doesn't anyone tell you anything about coming here ..and doing all my work? Tell me, do you want your wife to come here? Is every desire ever fulfilled? You're right. What is it, Neela? Nothing. Didn't you meet Alok today? It seems you're really falling in love with him. "On one hand you never ever think about me." "On one hand you never ever think about me." "On the other hand I can't stop thinking about you." "On one hand you never ever think about me." "Your eyes couldn't read what my eyes said." "Even I couldn't express what was in my heart." "Your eyes couldn't read what my eyes said." "Even I couldn't express what was in my heart." "How is anyone to solve this dilemma?" "How is anyone to cool down his unseen fire?" "On one hand you never ever think about me." "Unknowingly this heart has bonded with you." "Each heart beat of mine is in tune with that bond." "With every breath comes your name on my lips." "How do I say all this to you?" "On one hand I can't stop thinking about you." "On the other you never ever think about me." "On the other you never ever think about me." Good morning Alok! - Good morning! Did Shobha come? - No, not yet. Don't worry, she'll be here. And that pain, Neela? She just left. Listen Prem. Neela wants to organize a match in her Gymkhana. To raise money for me. We have to stop her at any cost. It isn't a bad idea at all. This Neela has turned out to be a smart girl. I'll have to discuss this idea with her. Where were you since morning? Where was I? I was busy with work, sir. And that too your work. I got statements of 15 people watching the match that day, ..sitting on the first two rows. You bought a new cigarette case? Yes, 22 carats, consider it as your own. You know Alok, in our business one has to be very alert, always. We should know, what the enemy wants. What his intentions are? And what his moves are. We must always be one step ahead of the enemy. Great, you've bought many new books here. But they are all boring subjects. Don't you have any spy books here? As a child I loved them. I've read a lot of spy books. But my favourite spy was Sherlock Holmes. It was great fun. This house looks very neat and tidy. Thanks to Neela. She painted the walls before I came here. And the pest control guys have sprayed all the rooms. Pest control! In all the rooms? I think they started doubting. Didn't I tell you not to keep the mic behind the books? Then was your idea a better one? To keep the mic in a tea pot during breakfast? You act smart! Read this court appeal. I don't understand this, don't show me. It's very important, especially the line at the bottom. Isn't that interesting? What paper is he showing him? The camera can't, read that from so far. I hate those people, ..who instead of saying it clearly, speak in riddles. Alok, is this water heater working properly? - Yes! Did you benefit from it? - Yes, slightly. I can't put it on just show me how to do it. Can't you see.. All your rooms have mikes like this one. And in those rooms, your movements are being recorded. Shooting. - Shooting! Yes with a camera! There are spies after you. So we'll shut all the windows and remove all mikes. That's it! Not now.. - Why? Let me explain. Look Alok, every word of ours is being recorded. And all our moves are being caught on camera. Now we know this but those idiots don't know that we know. We can take advantage of this situation. - How? We can use these microphones to mislead them. They'll believe in whatever we say. I don't understand anything. You'll understand very soon. This will help us succeed very soon. I'll lay such a trap for him, ..he'll immediately agree to a compromise. Else I'm not Prem Sagar B.A.L.L.B. Mr. Magan, one more new girl. Shut up and do your job. I'm doing my job. I'm sure it's his wife. Let me also see. Come, Shobha. Where had you been? You said, you would take care of me. I went for a program. But I'm here now. Let me see, how you look! Look. How do I look? Exactly as you were before. And how do I look? Just like you were after our wedding. I haven't changed too. How long will you stay here? I had a program in Calcutta, ..but I told them I won't be able to come, ..as a relative was sick. You did the right thing. I'm sick and also your relative. Maybe I'm not anymore but I was once upon a time. Alok, please. As soon as you get some money, please get this sofa repaired. Of course I will, long live Prem. If I wish, I can stuff this sofa with money. Do you know, I've a new Mercedes? Prem drives it these days but it's actually mine. What is most important is that you should get better. What does the doctor say? He says, I've hurt my backbone. I've pulled some nerves too. They are all linked. But you'll see I'll get well very soon. I'll start walking and running before the doctors' deadline. But I'm not sure, Shobha. Maybe I've to spend many months in this chair. How long will this lie go on? - What? I lied about a relative's sickness and didn't go to Calcutta. And I came here, to meet you. Come Neela, this is Shobha. Didn't I tell you? Shobha, this is Neela. She has done a lot for me. You weren't able to come. She took care of me. I'll see what's there in the kitchen. - Ok. Neela, help Shobha with everything. Shobha knows little about the kitchen. - Yes. Excuse me. Please don't bother, I'll do everything. It was my ball that hit him. I felt so bad that day. Since then, I'm serving Alok. So that I can make up for what I've done. What's your fault? Alok is so nice, so naive, so understanding. You don't have to tell me what Alok is. You didn't come for two days. He used to wait for you daily. Mr. Prem can't think about anything else but money. But Alok was always talking about you. That's how Alok is. Sweet but naive and foolish. If Alok has his way, no one would get even a single rupee. The two are in the kitchen. Johnny, see what he's doing. He's going to the kitchen too. Where has Shobha gone? - To take a shower. Shobha is very fond of pickles. Serve it on a separate plate. There's no pickle. Look in this cupboard. I've hidden two bottles from the maid. It's kept up there, behind. Mango and pepper pickles. Get them both. Yes. What do you think of Shobha? Look at me, I'm asking you. You have just met her. Have dinner with us. No, I've to leave. Neela, you've done a lot for me. You are always at my service. But you've your own work too. Shobha has come back too. I feel she will be staying here. So you don't have to bother anymore. Thank you very much for doing so much for me. - Alok! I don't know what relation you have with Alok. And neither do I want to know. You should be aware that I'm Alok's wife. And if another woman serves him, I don't like it. You had better not come here from tomorrow. What's wrong with you? All I wanted was to see Alok getting well. I wanted to see him walk normally again. Nothing else. Calm down, Neela. What's the use of crying? I'll go away from here. I won't stay here. Don't say such things, Neela. Your Tata Gold Cup Tournament is coming up. The responsibility of the club is on you. The club is surviving only because of you. Calm down. You have become thin. I've lost 5 pounds. Should I open your collar? Actually, I do these things myself. "Put off the burning lights." "Then lay your loving eyes on me." "I'm not a stranger, recognize me." "Take me in your arms, why stay apart?" "Don't think at all today." "Put off the burning lights." "Everything is just the same, nothing has changed." "Everything is just the same, nothing has changed." "This opportunity is beautiful and so is the destination." "Then why only wish, when I'm here?" "Why hide your desires?" "Remove all barriers today. Don't think of anything." "Just put off the burning lights." Let me see, who is on the phone. Hello! Yes. Congratulations on your new life, Shobha. It's good that you've come back. All right, how is my little kid? He's good. Our good old days are back again. We just had our food. Now we are going to bed. Going to bed! Give him the phone. How's this sari? I'll just wear my embroidered sari too and show you. Yes, lad. If I were in your place, I'd control myself. I know your wife has come after a long time. I can understand your condition. But control yourself. This isn't the right place or time for love and romance. Got it? Don't be foolish. Are you my god that I've to obey you. God! - What's he saying? But listen.. - Ok, as you wish. But whatever you do, pose nicely. Because you're being shot from outside. How is this one? - It's rubbish! "Those beautiful moments are back again." "Those beautiful moments are back again." "Let's repeat the same saga again." "In this dewy night, these moments are so silken." "It seems time itself has stopped." "Remove all distances." "Put off the burning lights." "I'm not a stranger, recognize me." "Take me in your arms, why stay apart?" "Don't think at all today." "Don't think at all today." C'mon, Neela, why are you standing like a corpse? Come. Look what that accident has done to Neela. - Yes. We lost yesterday's match too. Neela couldn't score even a single goal. Thankfully it was a friendly match, else we would've been ashamed. Neela, day after is the Tata Gold Cup match. Do you wish to lose it? Why don't you answer? Are you the captain for nothing? What did you say? Your problem is your personal business. Why are you disgracing the club? Shut up Sunita. - Why should I? If you are the captain, why do things that are shameful? Neela! - Sunita! What are you doing? Neela! What are you doing? - Leave her. You dare hit me! No one is listening to me. Stop it! I won't spare you! Let go! What are you doing? Sunita listen to me. Stop it! Hello Shobha! - Hello! You're wearing a sexy dress today. Sit. Is everything in control? - Yes. Young lad, take this, our company's paper. There are seven copies, sign all of them. Which company is this? Alok Prakash Charities Trust. I didn't get it. The day you get it, you'll be proud of your Alok. Done? Very good! All right, done with this for now. Now…Yes! I've spoken to Neela and made all arrangements. Next Saturday, at the Gymkhana ground, ..there will be a grand hockey benefit match. Alok will be given an award of honour during the interval. After which, all the lights will be turned off. And then, 50,000 spectators will be requested, ..to light up a match stick, ..and pray for Alok's speedy recovery. Just imagine what a sight that would be! 50,000 burning matchsticks in the darkness! Later, a spotlight will be focused on Alok. And Alok will then get up and go to the mic. Slowly, gradually. There will be huge applause. And then, Alok, will make a grand presentation of our scheme. Except the doctor's fees, all the money collected that night, ..will go to the Alok Prakash Charity Trust for the handicapped. I don't get you. We don't want people to point fingers at us, ..and say that we have filed this case to get rich. We may not be super rich, ..but according to our capacity, ..we are helping the poor and unfortunate people. So that they see a ray of hope in this darkness. Johnny, get up. - Don't bother me. Get up, it's already 4 hours. Don't fool me. Get up, it's important. I've to go to meet Mr. Rungta immediately. You start the camera. Damn! It would've been nice if I had listened to my uncle, ..and set up a liquor business. I have to go to the office. One very important call is about to come. 50,000 burning match sticks. I hope it doesn't rain. I'm afraid we won't be able to repair the sofa. Prem. What's this joke about handicapped and charity trust? Joke? - Don't fool around. We are getting this money after such hardship. Why blow it up this way? No one's blowing up money. This is just to pressurize the newspaper's lawyers. They can fight with me. But they can't face the Charity Trust for the handicapped. When the judge hears, ..the money is going for charity, I can bet we will win the case. But what will we get? And the money I want? Everyone will get their share at the right time. But if you give it to.. - Hold on. I'll have to tell you the truth one day. Listen. All the rooms upstairs, ..have hidden microphones fixed. The spies can hear all that we speak. And they are also taking our pictures. Pictures? - Yes. From where? From the flat on the other side of this road. - Why? Ok, I'll disclose this one too. Listen. Our Alok is absolutely fine. It's all an act. He's acting on my orders and also for you. So that you always stay near him and all of us earn millions. Four different specialist doctors have examined him. Are they all stupid? No, they aren't stupid but I'm a tad smarter than them. But why do you care? You remain concerned about your money. What do I need to do? Just keep an eye on Alok. Don't allow him to do anything silly. Keep him glued to the chair. I'll be really thankful to you if you do this. How much? Rest assured, it's enough for everyone. I'll try my best. - That's a good girl. You've become thinner! 'Except the doctor's fees, all the money collected that night,' 'will go to the Alok Prakash Charity Trust for the handicapped.' 'We don't want..' You know what this means? Just another ordinary move by Prem Sagar. It isn't an ordinary move! When the judge realizes that all the money is going for charity, ..he'll order us to pay the maximum amount! 5 million! We've already lost two cases! Sir, I still think all this is just an act. You think! Do I pay you fees to know what you think! I'm really sorry, I couldn't do anything so far. Yes, you didn't do a thing and that too in Eastman colour. I'll try again. Enough of your trials! You're dismissed from today. Get lost! Let me do my job, sir. - Get lost! Pay me only after I do the job well. - I'm ruined. Hello? Speaking. Bharucha? Who? Editor, sir! Hello, How are you? You want to meet me? Hold on. Let me check in my diary. Where is it? Here it is. Ok. Tomorrow? It's Sunday tomorrow. No, I'm too busy on Sunday and Monday. Tuesday. That's also out of question. Wednesday is out too. Thursday is out too. Friday, I've no time to even die on Friday. Monday? One minute. 11 to 10! 11 to 11:10 is when we can meet. Will that be too late? By the way what are you doing now? Then why don't you come here? You're nearby. I'm expecting a client but anyway, take a chance. So you're coming, right? Ok, see you. Come in. Welcome, sir. Please pardon my office, it's a bit disorganized. - Not at all. Actually, my secretary used to do all this. Then she got married. Too bad! When did she get married? About ten years back. She married me. Please sir, sit here. - Come. Take care. Excuse me, please sit here. You're still standing. We've this! Please sit. All right then, please proceed. We'd like to finish Alok Prakash's case by March 31st. Yes. - So that our accounts in the new year stay clear. Actually, we're legally against a settlement. But still, we've convinced Mr. Rungta with great difficulty. And on our paper's behalf, we can pay you 20,000 as penalty. Desai, if you're talking about 20,000, I'm sure sir must've permitted at least 30 to 40. And if sir has permitted 30 to 40,000, ..then he can surely pay at least 50. Right sir? Sir, I say, instead of dealing in such puny amounts, ..why don't we start the negotiations from 50,000? 50,000? We can pay 25,000 at the most. Sir, even 50,000 is unacceptable to us. All right, 30,000. Why are you in such haste? Maybe, you wouldn't have to pay us anything at all. Let this case go to the court. The judge will think. Please sir. 32,000! You've come to my office for the first time, will you have something? Tea, coffee? 35,000. - Soft drinks? 40,000! 40,000. Are you free on Saturday night? Yes, we are free. Have you heard of Wankhede hockey stadium? - Yes. Come there! A benefit match will be played. Alok Prakash Charity. - Sir! All right then, 50,000. Take it, else we are leaving. - Sir! 50,000.00 When this case started, I had written an amount on a chit. Where is it? I had decided then, I won't accept a penny less than that amount. You won't get even a penny more than 50,000. 60,000! 60,000.00 No, there's something else here. 'Sports. Bombay's famous women's hockey team, Gymkhana Club,' 'has been disqualified from the Tata Gold Cup tournament.' 'The Gymkhana Club captain, Neela,' 'got into a fight during a match.' 'It's said she abused the referee during the match' 'and hit him with a hockey stick.' 'And when other girls from the team intervened,' 'she hit them too.' 'One player's head is seriously injured.' 'Neela was arrested and is now out on bail.' 'Gymkhana Club manager Peter Gonzalves said,' 'disciplinary action will be taken against Ms. Neela' 'and she has been dismissed. from the club indefinitely.' 'In the third cricket test against New Zealand,' 'Pakistan scored 365 runs in the first innings and..' Good that Neela doesn't come here. Our last call is 550,000. Still not right. - God! Hello. - Prem, did you watch the TV? Did you hear, what Neela did? She needs a good lawyer. Listen Alok, there are many other lawyers in Bombay. And you are disturbing a lawyer, ..who is fighting your case to death right now, I can't do anything for Neela. Damn! Try to understand. We are stuck with a big fish right now. 8? 7! What did Prem say? He's too busy. - He's right. I don't know why you're sympathizing with her. Alok! Do you know why Neela is in this state today? Why she's behaving crazily? Why are you worried? Shobha, I've lied to you, I'm completely.. Everything will be fine, just sit down quietly. Why refuse wealth coming your way? Just a few days more. We will build our home all over again. Don't you want me to fulfill my dreams. To become a top artist? Don't act silly, Alok, think smart at least once. Please, just for me, for a few more days. My darling. Mr. Magan. Mr. Magan. Mr. Magan, there is a message for you. Your Labyrinth Plan has failed. Flopped! Now pack your bags and get going from here. Listen, your plan has failed. They know we are hiding here. Let's go. No Johnny, we shouldn't give up like this. I'll call up Mr. Rungta and be right back. Just stay here, ok? And keep doing all this. Good morning! Get some champagne, some whiskey, get ready for a party. Prem is everything done? Is this Mr. Alok Prakash's house? - Tell me please. If this is really Mr. Alok Prakash's house, ..then I have a cheque to give him. Rs. 1 million only. Prem! "Luck has smiled." "We are rich." "The trap, I had laid, has netted a great catch." "It's raining money all over." "Not just 2, 4, 10 but it's about a million." "Luck has smiled." "We are rich." "The trap, I had laid, has netted a great catch." "Luck has smiled." "The dream that I had seen once." "That the world will swoon to my tunes." "Listening to my voice, this world will dance crazily." "The dream that I had seen once." "I'm the queen of tunes and princess of songs." "I'm the life of sweet melodies." "I'm the queen of tunes and princess of songs." "I'm the life of sweet melodies." "I've lit many a lamp with my songs. "I've caused rains without clouds." "I'm the queen of tunes and princess of songs." Once more. Thank you. "It's a beautiful day that has brought joys." "It's a beautiful day that has brought joys." "It's my deeds that have shown this miracle." "It's raining money all over." "Not just 2, 4, 10 but it's about a million." "Luck has smiled." "We are rich." "The trap that I had laid, has netted a great catch." I had promised to present it to you on a marble platter. Now, I present it to you on a silver platter. How did this happen? Because the plaintiff Alok Prakash, ..has withdrawn charges against the accused, Midweek paper, ..it's management and it's editor Mr. Bharucha. On the condition that the accused will pay the complainant, Alok Prakash a sum of Rs. 1 million as compensation. 1 million! I could've churned out more from them. But it was already 3 in the morning. And that old Mr. Rungta, began to cry. I pitied him. Actually, I can't bear to see old people crying. I too feel like crying with joy. Look at the number of zeroes on this. - Yes. Alok, what's it? Smile, young lad. You've won the biggest compensation in Bombay's history! And you're sulking here as if you've lost everything. So what do I do? Dance like you? No way, not now. You're still not well. But in a week or two you'll walk using crutches. And about a week or so later you'll start walking with a stick. Why are you being so kind to me? So that you can go to the bank very soon. Limping a little, then take this cheque and.. Shobha bring out some sweets. - Yes, why not? Listen, come here. - Yes. Go. Mr. Rungta has compromised. Good riddance! I'm leaving to watch a movie. I haven't seen a movie for such a long time. - What are you doing? Case closed. - No. I won't give up so easily. We have to accept it, sir. You're no match for Prem Sagar. He's a sly man. - Prem Sagar is sly but Alok Prakash isn't. This is our last chance. Where are you going? To the opposite flat. You stay here, on the camera. Shoot everything! Look Alok dear, you're now an owner of a hefty sum. You should be more careful now. This world is full of cheats and thugs. I know that. But you're lucky because I'm with you. You must be thinking that I'm a smart, great lawyer. But I'm a much smarter and sharper businessman. I'll have to be even more careful now. The greatest art in business is to spread your money. Invest some in exports, some in shares. But invest the maximum in property. A lot can be adjusted there. Prem as for spreading the money, I want 50,000 too. So that I can use this money to show, ..there are stars other than Lata Mangeshkar in the world of music. You're still obsessed with films. This time I'll prove what I am. My songs will be premiered in Shanmukhanand hall. The governor will inaugurate it. Lata Mangeshkar will be called as the chief guest. And I'll have my P.R.O and secretary. That's it! Producers, music directors will make a queue for me. Yes and then silver disc, golden disc, platinum disc. There'll be discs all over! Prem! - I'm afraid you may end up with a slip disc. Detective Magan, welcome. Have you come alone? Haven't you brought the pest control guys? May I go in for a minute? - From here? I mean whenever you come you either use the balcony, ..else sometimes through microphones in books. That chapter is now closed. If you permit, can I take my stuff back? - With pleasure. Mr. Magan, we are really sad that your work is over. You were such a nice neighbour. You used to watch our house round the clock. No thief could dare come here! I was just doing my job. I've no personal enmity with anybody. But you see, Mr. Magan, ..sometimes the clever fox tries to jump for the grapes. And you know the consequences of that. Any news about that hockey player, Neela? - No! She learnt a good lesson. Girls have become very rude these days. They don't respect anyone. Her captaincy had gone to her head. Mr. Magan, enough of it. Out! - How can a lady hit a man? And that too a referee as old as her father. What a shame? Only a cheap, snobbish girl could do this. Thank god they threw her out. - Idiot! One more word and I'll slit your tongue. Thank you! - Alok! Well done Alok! Johnny! You fell for his trap, you fool! - Johnny! I'm the real fool. Had I leaked Alok's secret to the media, I would've got Rs. 50,000! Johnny, did you take the picture? - Yes boss! My camera was rolling. But since it's early morning, there was little light in the room. Did you hear? It isn't too late even now. Come. Sit down. Come, please. Get lost! Let's do it once more. - Yes. What are you doing, Alok? How much is the exposure? 5.6! - Make it 2.8. Ok. And cut down the glare, right. Ready! - Yes. These fingers are perfect! Now watch the magic of this leg. Keep the camera on. Got it? The leg is fine, right? Now watch the backbone. Backbone! - Lift it, c'mon. Well done! This is a bit heavy. Pick this, lift the table. Well done! C'mon lift it, very good! See my backbone! You see it too! See my backbone! Amazing! Alok please continue! Look at my backbone! Mr. Magan, did you get it? Did you get what you wanted? Prem, why don't you do something? Alok has already done everything. Sorry Shobha, you've lost your 50,000. God saved Lata Mangeshkar! Now you become a chorus singer. I was such a fool to come here! You wanted to leak my secret, right? But your secret is out. I don't need you anymore. Get lost from here! No, wait! See this? Take this! Now leave! Get lost from here! My music! Sorry genius! I'm sorry to have spoilt your party. Not at all. I'll trap someone else. Young lad, do one thing. Use this car today. They will take it tomorrow. And find her, find Neela. She's the right one for you. We've done great injustice to the poor girl. And if possible, apologize to her on my behalf too. Take it. For the first time, I feel that maybe, ..my sister married the right man. Your sister has married the right man, ..but how the hell did I land up with these people! Wait, Magan! The game is over but the work isn't. I've something to say. Switch on the camera. Roll it, let's do him a favour. How clever he thought he was. I, Prem Sagar, advocate, B.A.L.L.B want to make a statement. I'm shocked and surprised, my client is ditching me. But my client Alok Prakash can't be charged for any legal offence, ..because in this case there wasn't any exchange of money. But the owner of Midweek News, Mr. Rungta, ..it's editor Mr. Bharucha ..and also their lawyer Desai have gone against the law. They've intruded into my client's private affairs. This is an offence under Indian penal code, section 365. Therefore, these three should be legally prosecuted. Moreover I'll appeal to the collector of Bombay, ..to issue an order to cancel the license of one detective Mr. Magan. Mr. Magan has not only helped the three accused, ..but also stained the image of the poor. By insulting Ms. Neela, he has insulted womankind. This isn't just against the Indian constitution, ..but also against the United Nations' Human Rights' Division's, ..Civil Rights Commission, ..which is approved by the Indian government. And also International Vigilance Committee For Civil Liberties, ICVKP organization.. Why are you lighting the match stick. Today a grand benefit match, …was to be played here to honour my friend. Remember, what you had said to that friend at the hospital? Anyone who lies should be taught a good lesson. Alok Prakash is a liar, he's a fraud. Teach him a good lesson. Why did you do it? Why? For the sake of money. You're lying. If it was for money, ..why did you leave the wheel chair and come here? Because I started hating that atmosphere. I despise those characters. And Neela, I hate myself. Here, do what you want. Do I put on a collar and seat you on a wheelchair? No, I can't do it. Where are you going leaving all this. I don't know but no more hockey for me. Don't be disheartened. You're known name in hockey. You're the captain of your club. You're a good player too. I used to be. But not anymore. - How can you say that? While playing, when people taunt you, ..it's wise to leave the game. Neela, I'm sure you must have played badly. Certainly! Your mind is always bogged down by my accident. Whatever it is but no hockey for me. So what will you do now, Neela? Anything but not hockey. I must leave, I'm leaving Bombay today. Neela, ..give it to me. What happened? Alok! The phone is ringing, why is no one picking it? Phone? Yes, phone, can't you hear? There is no phone here? How many of me can you see? Two! Two? One Neela who's the Gymkhana Club's captain. And the other foolish girl, who is leaving Bombay. Now will you go for the hockey practice from tomorrow? And you wouldn't leave Bombay too? - No. And you'll come to my house from tomorrow? What? - Shobha has left my house. Forever! - But.. Neela, we got divorced ages back. And now.. - And now? And now, I can't live without you, Neela.
