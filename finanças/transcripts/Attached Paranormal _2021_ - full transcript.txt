Good evening, I'm Rachel Bennett with 27 news. Breaking news, a local detective's son has just released video footage of a suicide online, but if you think you will watch this footage, let me leave you with one question. Do you believe in the paranormal? 911, what is your emergency? My husband. Oh my God, there's blood everywhere, and he's not moving, and I don't know what to do! All units respond. Car 15 responding. EMT is en route. Officers are on the scene. What's up, guys? Just getting things ready. Do I have a surprise for you. So, my dad is a detective that looks into old cases. I snooped through some of the boxes he brought home the other day, and found video footage from a local crime years ago. I cut and edited the footage a bit to put it in a watchable format with some of my finishing touches, but take a look, and tell me what you think. Suicide or not? Feel free to leave comments on my page, and hit that like button. Okay, here we go. James, what are you doing down there? I'm trying to figure the camera out. Are you seriously going to try and record this weird shit? It just keeps getting worse- - Don't worry, Nat, you're going away on business, anyway. This has to get documented. I hit the button. All right, I think I have figured this out enough to get started here, so. Little backstory first. A few weeks ago, I went on a haunted ghosts tour in an old, abandoned prison, not too far down the road from here. It was a pretty cool experience, but, ever since I got home, some really strange things have been happening around my house. This is my wife Natalie. Get that out of my face. Yeah, she doesn't like to be seen on camera that much. I did it again. Like I was saying, but she's actually getting ready to leave on a business trip for a few days, and I figured, while she was away, I would use the time to document some of the things going on, and put it up online for you guys to all view and tell me what you guys think is going on. You know, anyway- - I'm almost ready to leave soon. Okay, Nat. You know, we got back form the haunted ghost tour and all kinds of strange things were going on. You know, we'd hear noises, things were getting moved out of place, and I swear on my life, I even see this shadow figure in my bedroom. I mean, this stuff is really starting to freak us out. James, I'm leaving now. Okay. All right, have a safe trip. I love you. I love you, I'll call you. All right. All right. Ah, we're a little blurry here. Let it correct itself. Anyway, the fun's about to begin. What I'm gonna do is record day and night in different rooms of the house. We're gonna try to record what we can. Depending on what we get on camera, we're gonna upload it to the Internet for you guys to all watch, and I want yous to be the deciding factoring. Am I nuts or is there something really going on inside my house? Let the fun begin. All right. So now let's do a little walkthrough. I'm gonna kind of just describe and show you the rooms where the most things happen. Let's get started here. We'll start in the kitchen here. Kind of a lot happens in the kitchen. You know, in the kitchen we'll have things getting moved around. You hear dishes moving, cabinets opening and closing. This has happened in the day already, but it mainly happens at night. But, I mean, the weirdest thing is when things get moved. Like right here is a cup, right? This cup will be here. I'll put it there. And like an hour later, I'll come back in, and this thing will be moved over here. So it'll go from here to here all on its own. You know, unless I'm going crazy, which I really don't think I'm going crazy, but something weird's going on. This is what we're trying to find out. Hopefully, we catch it on camera. So we'll keep going. We'll go into the living room here. The living room, as you can see, it's sort of decorated for Halloween in here a little bit. Some stuff there. Little bit there. Anyway, the living room, we haven't caught too much. We mainly hear it more coming from other rooms, either the kitchen or upstairs while we're down here. But you might hear like a door opening, shutting, and, you know, squeaking a little bit, but it's mainly coming from other rooms outside here. So I'm gonna walk upstairs to the bedroom. It's where the most happens. So while we're inside the bedroom here. Here's the bed that we sleep in. While I'm sleeping in the bed, we'll hear the noises. I swear that, one night, the covers started pulling off as me as I was trying to sleep. So, hopefully, we'll get something like that on camera one of these nights, but, you know, Nat thinks I'm crazy, and I know I'm not crazy, and I know I saw what I saw. Right on that wall over there next to the window is where the black shadow figure was, and it just kinda creeped, almost as if it came out of the ground, just kinda creeped up, and it just slowly walked its way and just vanished right through the wall. I even ran to the other side of the room. When I got to the other side, there was nothing there. I mean, this is some strange stuff, some really freaky stuff starting to happen here. You know, I don't know what else to do other than try to document it and let others decide what's going on. We're gonna walk back downstairs. Okay. We're looking good. All right, we look all set up. All right, I'm setting up on the kitchen for the first night. Hopefully, we catch something moving or find out what one of those sounds are that we hear while we're trying to sleep, so let's hope for the best. I'm leaving this cup set up here. Hopefully, we catch it moving during the night. I'll see you in the morning. Oh, my gosh. Oh, morning. I didn't sleep too well, but I didn't hear anything, either, last night, so you never know. Doesn't happen every night. Oh, and I found our cat Pixie. You know what, she doesn't ever seem to get too scared or freaked out by anything, so. But you never know. I have to work today, so I'm gonna eat and get ready and go to work. We'll film again later tonight. All right. All right, looks good. What's up, guys? We're on the kitchen again. I'm gonna cover the kitchen one more night, just to try to cover, you know, all the sounds and stuff that I hear. I wanna try to get something on camera here. It's a good spot, but I am gonna put the cup back on the counter, too, to see if we can get that moving or not during the night. Let's hope for something. What the hell was that? Okay, so I just woke up to a noise. I know I heard a noise, it was like a door or a cabinet or something shutting, like slamming almost. It was kinda loud. It was more loud than anything ever so far. I'm gonna look around. Well, I couldn't find anything. I didn't see anything. I guess when we watch the camera footage back, we'll eventually see what it was, if we caught anything or not, but I'm gonna let you keep setting up here. I'm gonna get back to bed. Oh. I'm still so tired. I told yous, I don't know what that noise was, but it was something. I'm gonna get some breakfast quick. I do have some running around to do today, so, what I'm thinking is, I'll leave the camera set up, filming during the day a little bit, just to see if we can catch anything during the day. All right, so I'm gonna have you set up here on the family room here while I'm watching some TV tonight. We'll see what we get. I swear, I hear something from the upstairs, but I don't know what it is. Let's go check it out. Nothing. So, I went up and looked around, and I didn't see anything. But I heard stuff, some noises, but I don't know. I'm gonna leave this set up down here for the rest of the night. I'm not gonna sleep up there after that. I'll sleep right on the couch. All right, so, I'm gonna eat some breakfast, and then I gotta head out for the day, so we'll set back up later today then, all right? All right. So, change of plans. I think I'm gonna leave you set up on the family room here while I run out and do my errands, so, hopefully, we get something. All right, guys, I'm gonna set up in my bedroom for tonight. See what we get. Well, I don't know if we caught anything on the camera last night or not, but I didn't hear anything. I'm gonna start getting ready for the day, and catch up with yous later. All right, guys, I'm gonna do something a little different today. I'm gonna walk around the house and ask some questions. If something's really here, maybe we'll get a response. If there's a spirit in this house, can you give us a sign? Why are you here? What is your purpose? I don't know, guys, nothing yet. Oh, shit, what was that? Is something with us? If something is in this room, can you please give us. What? What the fuck? Okay, that picture frame fell, and I don't know why. This is getting a little weird. Why are you here, and what do you want? Yeah, I'm a little freaked out by that, so I think I'm done for now. eerie tones continue All right, guys, we're gonna try the bedroom again here tonight to see if we get something. I don't think we got anything last night, so give it another shot. I actually slept pretty good last night. I didn't wake up. I haven't slept that good in a long time. saw or heard anything last night, but this shit is fucking crazy. What the fuck is this? I don't know if someone's playing a fucking game on me right now or what the fuck's going on, but what I do know is I don't even know if I can be in this fucking house anymore. You know, I don't even know what's going on. I mean, is this really happening? You know, I never believed in this kind of stuff, but it's really starting to freak me out. I mean, I'm parked in just some random parking lot. I don't even know what to do. I think I need to just go home and get a few things, and stay in a hotel for the night. What's up, guys? I can't take this shit anymore. I don't know, I'm just gonna come here and get a few things, and I'm gonna leave 'cause, honestly, I don't even wanna be here anymore by myself. What the fuck is going on? Why don't you just leave me alone! What the hell? Let me out of this house! Leave me alone! I don't know what's going on right now. I've never been so scared in my life. Just leave me the fuck alone. God, please help me I must've fell asleep in the closet. That was the scariest thing in my life. And it's getting out of hand. What the fuck? Look, this is getting really out of hand. Like, this is my home, and I'm scared to even be here. I need to find someone to help me. So I found this guy that does spiritual cleansing. I don't know, he says he can help, so. He should be here soon. Hi, I'm James. - Chris. - Come on in. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, you feel that right away, don't ya? - Yeah. - As soon as you walk in the place. Just take a seat here. So, you know, I've been filming for a few days now. Mainly because I wanna prove that I'm not insane, but, also, there's something really going on here. Yeah. You know, why don't you begin, just tell me when and how this whole thing got started. So, a few weeks ago, we went on this haunted tour, kind of local. Ever since, things have been really strange around here. Kind of started small, but the more we mess with it, the stronger it gets. Anything strange happen on the tour? Not that I can think of. Any strange noises? Unusual feelings? Well, it was an old prison, so. But there was this one cell. We walked by and it just felt almost like all the hair on my body stood up. Yeah. Yeah. Listen, after talking with you on the phone and hearing your story how this started I think I'm starting to know what's going on. A spirit's attached itself to you. It's likely it happened on the tour. All right, now, when this happens, it'll continue to follow you, take your energy. Feed off your emotions, until you find a way to get rid of it. So how do we do that? Oh, I know how to do it. Thing is, spirits get strength from fear. The more attention you give it, the stronger it gets. Well, I just need to get rid of this thing. It's not safe anymore. I want it gone before my wife gets home. Okay. Okay, James, let's prepare. It's probably best if we start down here, work our way upstairs. All right. All right, let's get started. This is a house of God. In the name of God, the Father Almighty, you'll leave this house, leave this family alone. Hey, you feel that? The energy is getting stronger. It definitely doesn't want me in here. In the name of Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior, you'll leave this house, leave this family alone. In the name of the Holy Spirit. In the name of the Holy Spirit. You will leave this house. Now! In the name of Jesus Christ. What the fuck? Is this real? What's going on? You will leave this house now. Jesus Christ. What the fuck? Are you okay? I need to finish. This house is a house of God. This man is a child of God. You are not welcome here. In the name of the Father, in the name of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, you will leave this house and go back from whence you came. I think we're good. I don't feel it anymore. That's the strongest spirit I've found in a long time. I think we're all right. I think we're gonna be all right. Hey, guys, sorry, the battery died earlier. So, this guy came, he did what he had to do. Honestly, I think it worked. Nothing's happened since. I don't feel anything around me. I honestly feel like my mind, my body, I feel so much more at ease right now, so that's a good thing, but I don't wanna take chances. So, we're gonna set up one last time tonight in the bedroom. I wanna make sure we don't catch anything on camera. I wanna make sure this thing is gone for good. The shit was getting scary for a little bit, so, all right, I'll see yous later tonight. All right, just about set up here. All right, so let's give this one last night here. Hope that everything's gone. What the hell was that? I'm getting the fuck out.
