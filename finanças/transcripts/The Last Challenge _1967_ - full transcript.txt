[instrumental music] [gunshot] [music continues] [music continues] [instrumental music] [indistinct chattering] [music continues] Loupy, play something a little livelier. [instrumental music] - Oh! Sorry, sorry. - You again. You ever gonna quit stumblin' around, Randall? [sighs] I said sorry. You're always makin' a fool of yourself, kid. You're yellow too. I told you, Billy, I told you not to call me that again. I'll call you yellow every time I see you. I'm gonna call you this time. [dramatic music] Get him out of here. You just made a bad mistake, mister. You know who's talking to you, mister? Oh, no, unless I'm mistaken, I'm talking to a third rate pistolero by the name of Billy Turpin. And just who might you be, mister? Blaine. Marshal Daniel Blaine. That's a pretty target, marshal. You know, I told you that you're a third rate pistolero. Now I'm gonna tell you something else. I'm not. Now you best turn around and walk out of here while you're still alive. I'm not walkin'. [indistinct chattering] [gunshot] [indistinct chattering] I, uh, heard the shots and I come running, Dan. I've seen 'em carrying that fellow out. Wasn't that Billy Turpin, uh, the new hired gun for the Two Eagle? Yes. [sighs] Well, uh.. ...how'd you whip him, Dan? No, I didn't whip him, Harry. Maybe I should've. [instrumental music] I think I know how he feels. He just shot a man to death. Wasn't much of a man. But he was a man and Dan killed him. He's only doing his duty. His duty. Doing what he's been paid to do for nearly ten years. Since that night he stepped in when that saddle tramp killed Marshal McKendrick. Well, someone will always step in to do what's wanted. Yeah, I guess. I guess I know that as well as anyone. [instrumental music] [music continues] - Morning, Sadie. - Mornin'. Still sleepin', I reckon. Yes, no need to wake him up. Tell the other girls to keep quiet. Don't worry, ma'am. We won't make any noise. - Morning, girls! Morning, Joey. - Morning. I got your egg all ready for you, Miss Lisa. - Just the way you likes 'em. - Oh! I'm not too hungry. Maybe I'll eat later when I get back. Thank you. You got your basket ready, Sally? - Yes, Miss Lisa. I'm ready. - Alright. Let's get going. It's payday, you know. - And, Lou. - Yessum. Your room is like a pigpen. See that you get it straightened up this morning and tell the girls the same thing. Wouldn't like to see any of you come up short on your pay. Yes, ma'am. [whistles] Ain't she on the warpath this mornin'? Oh, she's alright. Believe me, this place is like home compared to some I've seen. - Joey? - Yes, Miss Outdoors. What you plannin' on doing with 'em eggs? Don't rightly know, Miss Outdoors. Don't rightly know. Well trot 'em right over here then. Alright. - Outdoors. - Mm-hmm. Why do they call you Outdoors? Why, honey, that's 'cause that's what my heart's just as big as, that's why. [chuckles] You're gonna have something else just as big you keep eating two breakfasts like that. Oh, I do alright. Some men cotton to a generous-size woman. - Mm-hmm. - Mm. - Good morning, Lisa. - Good morning, John. Sure is a pretty day. Yeah, looks like spring is here at last. Well, it was a long time coming, John. [instrumental music] Be with you in a minute, ma'am. Well-well, Miss Lisa, it looks like it comes out to exactly twenty seven dollars and fourteen cents. Want I should put it on your account? Cash and carry, Mr. Haskell. Just like always. Whatever you say, Miss Denton. I just wish all my customers was as reliable as you are. I'll send Joey down to pick up the things later. - Fine. There you are. - Thank you. Uh, you were going to do a check to see if that dress material I ordered came in. Oh, yes, ma'am. I'll only be a minute, Miss Lisa. How are you, Marie? Oh, I'm fine, Miss Lisa, just fine. Sally? Lookin' mighty fine this mornin'. Now tell me quickly before he comes back. How's everything? How are the children? Oh, we're making it pretty good. And I'm gettin' on fine with Dave's children. And you sure would be proud if you came out and saw the new baby. I'll surely try and call. Maybe in the next day or two. Hey, say hello to the girls for me? Of course, I will, Marie, and good luck. Afraid it ain't come in yet, Miss Lisa. Don't you worry now and I'll let you know as soon as it gets here. Alright. Bye. Sorry to keep you waiting, ma'am in order to deal with trash like that. Business is business and we can't be too choosy now, can we? I'd like a peck of white beans, Mr. Haskell. Yes, ma'am. One peck of white beans. I thought you were asleep. No, I wasn't asleep. I was just sitting here thinkin'. So what were you thinking about? Oh, what kinda day it's gonna be, and that's about it. Pretty day. Warm. You know I wonder if it's warm enough to go fishin'. Hmm? Now if that isn't like a man. At a time like this, what do you think about? Going fishing. Oh, I can't sit around here all day. People think I'm going soft. You know something, Mr. Blaine? - What? - Mr. Daniel Blaine. What are you so formal about? I got a notion. [both chuckling] Now you just keep that to yourself, huh? 'Cause I'm going fishing. Oh, if you weren't the rudest man I ever saw. And the nicest. I still don't understand why you don't wear your badge, Dan. Well, it makes me feel kinda foolish. A pistolero like me wearing a peace officer's star? Well, you are the marshal. Make sure you have a nice breakfast now. Alright. I'll see you tomorrow. Happy fishing. - Mornin'. - Mornin', marshal. - Mornin', Dan. - Mornin'. What in blazes is that smell around here? Oh, that's that, uh, that Injun I had to lock up last night for being so drunk. - Oh! - White Antelope. Oh, yeah. He's been throwin' up in there all night it looks like. I swear, Dan, that is a smelly Injun. I mean even to start with, I-I think that's, uh.. I think that's the smelliest Injun I ever come across. You know something, Harry, I swear you just sit there and suffocate before you'd do anything about it. - Oh, Dan, I-- - Now just a second. I'm going fishing. Now by the time I come back this place better be clean and fresh. Or you and I are gonna part company in a hurry. Alright, Ballard. Anybody wants me, you know where I'll be. Sure, Dan. Keep an eye peeled for Injuns out there. So long. - Buenos dias, mi padre. - Buenosdias. [instrumental music] [birds squawking] [dramatic music] - Ernie Scarnes. - Blaine. Help me, Blaine. Of all the people I know who ain't worth saving you're the first one who comes to my mind. I'm a pretty tough bird to kill, Blaine. I guess you found that out at Territorial Prison, eh? If I was real smart, you know what I'd do? I'd kill ya. I'd finish up what the Indians started. 'Ah, it wouldn't do for a peace officer to gun down' 'a innocent wounded man now, would it?' Here. What were you selling those Indians? Watered-down whisky or worn-out weapons? Just peaceable dealings, that's all. Look, if you figurin' on comin' in to my town I suggest you keep right on going. 'Cause there's nothing but trouble there for you as long as I'm alive, you hear? Well, surely, you ain't gonna leave me out here like this. [laughing] You're just mean enough to do it, I do believe. [horse neighing] - That your horse? - Yeah. Funny, the Indians didn't take him. They took my saddle and everything else. He was limping when they come along, I guess they figured he wasn't of use to 'em. It's lucky he did come along 'cause I was gonna leave you here. Alright, I'll give you three days for that horse to mend. And then you better be gone. Now come on. Whoa, whoa. You better see if that horse will move. You got a five mile ride to town. Dan Blaine, the good Samaritan. Gunman turned lawman. Where's your tin star? You better not ever see it on me. [scoffs] [dramatic music] [instrumental music] [music continues] [neighing] - Howdy? - Howdy? Cotton to some fried fish? I wouldn't wanna put you out none. Oh, you wouldn't be putting me out none. I already got one good one, there's plenty more where that came from. - I'm thanking you. - 'That's not necessary.' I got one. By golly, come on, fish. Come on, be a fish. That's it. That's it. Easy now, mister, you'll lose that fish for sure. That's a whale down there, you know that? Well, don't play around with him. Jerk him in! I ain't jerkin' him. I'mma jerk him in, I'll lose him for sure. Here, let me try, mister. I know I can land him. Damn it, this is my fish! Now you go catch your own. - Will ya? - There he goes. Yeah, I suppose you try your luck. Can't do any worse than me. I'll go take take care of the horses and get a fire going. It don't seem right, I mean taking your rig like this. Why not I suppose you get some more fish to go along with the one that I got, huh? I got one! You're not gonna leave that, are ya? Appears to me, I had about three to your one, mister-- Yeah, go on and eat it. It'll only go to waste if you don't. Sure do thank you. You know I haven't caught or eaten fish like this since I was a kid on Clinch Creek back in Tennessee. It's too bad the big one got away. It sure is. You say you're from Tennessee? Yeah, I was born there. Got any kinfolk there? - Nope. - Eh. You know I was just thinking I got some whisky cooling off in the stream down there. Round about this time, I usually have a drink. - Want some whisky? - Sure do. Why not? [rattling] [gunshot] You're pretty good with that handgun, ain't ya? Fair. Just fair. Well, I say you're a lot better than fair. Takin' off that rattlesnake's head in one shot? That's pretty good shootin'. 'Anyhow, I'm beholden to you.' I wouldn't like to find that fellow in my blankets. That is mighty good liquor. That's not bad. Good as my daddy used to make in Tennessee. I learned to make whisky in Tennessee. I was doing some soldiering there. You were in Ruckersville? Yeah. Did you fight at Shiloh Church? Yeah, I was at Shiloh. My daddy fought there. Lot of good men died there. That was a bad fight. Just about as bad as I ever saw. My daddy fought for the Confederacy. Did you fight on the Confederate side? No. Well, I don't suppose it makes much difference. One side's as good as another, I reckon. You really believe that? I mean that one side's as good as another? A man doesn't have to have a reason for what he does? I don't study much on reasons. Seems to me the only thing that matters is whether a man's any good or not. How does he know if he's good? Easy. He just finds the best there is. Then he knows the answer. I wouldn't wanna live my life thinking I was second best at anything I really wanted to do. You kill many men with that? - Some. - Did you get to like it? Yeah, some do, you know? You're a nice fellow, mister. Inviting me into your camp. But you're about to say something that will rile me. - 'Don't do it.' - Why? 'Cause I'm not particularly anxious to hurt you. Well, that's mighty kind of you. You're a strange one. Here. Have some more whisky. And where are you headed? Town up the way. What do you aim to do there? They got a lawman there named Blaine, Daniel Blaine. I've been hearing for a year now that he's about the fastest man with a handgun this side of Abilene. Now you're gonna find out if that's true. That's right. Oh, believe me, he's the best there is. I reckon that's something I have to find out for myself. Yeah. What might your name be? McGuire. Lot McGuire. And yours? Blaine. Daniel Blaine. [dramatic music] Beholden to you for the food and liquor, Mr. Blaine. I hope you believe me when I say I.. ...wouldn't have taken it had I known who you were. Oh, I believe you. I'll be ridin' on now. We'll meet again, won't we? If that's the way you want it. - Hola,hombre. - Senor. - Where can I stable my horse? - Yeah, senor. Straight on. Stable. You will see it. - Gracias. - Por nada, senor. - Stable my horse for me. - I reckon I could. - How much? - That depends. If you're just passing through, it will be two bits. Of course, if you plan on spending a little time it will be ten cents a day. That's all the hay it needs. If you want grain, that will be two bits extra. Reckon I'll stay a while. Oh, you got business here, have you? Might put it that way. 'Well, well, there ain't been one of you fellas through here' 'in, uh, nigh under a year, I reckon.' - What's that supposed to mean? - Oh, nothing much. That's a nice-lookin' piece of hardware you got there. Man totes an iron like that, he better keep it nice and clean. Well-oiled too. Never know when he might have to use it. Curious old fella. Well, at least, why, that's what my friend Dan Blaine always says. You ever hear of Dan Blaine? Well, he's the fella that keeps the peace here about. Matter of fact, I met a man down by the river tonight called himself by that name. Seemed like a nice enough fellow. That's Dan, alright? Well-spoken. Always has been. So you decided to come on in the town anyway, aye, son? You see me, don't you? I suppose you'll be looking for a bed. There's a hotel of sorts, uh, Lisa Denton's place. Most of the sports there. I'm thanking you kindly, mister.. Uh, Weeks, uh, Ballard Weeks. I'm Lot McGuire. Now don't you worry about your horse. If you ever need him again, he'll be waiting right here for you. Come on, horse. [instrumental music] I'd like a room. [speaking in Spanish] We have no more. [speaking in Spanish] Senor, we have one. Thank you. Come with me. [music continues] If you want anything, senor, uh.. McGuire, Lot McGuire. If you want anything, I am here. Senor? Anything you want, call me. [instrumental music] Oh, looks like you got all the luck tonight, Squint. Four clubs I had to draw to that time. I couldn't pull anything to go with them to save my soul. Who are you trying to fool, John? Bankers don't have souls, everyone knows that. We've had enough out of you, Lisa. How about you, Frank? - Behind? - John, I was born behind. Been laggin' further back everyday. Come on, come on, deal the cards. Squint's luck's bound to change sometime. I wonder. I just sometimes wonder. Evening, young man. - What's your pleasure? - I'll have a whisky. - Good evening. - Good evening, ma'am. Don't believe I've seen you before. Just get into town? Yes, ma'am, that's right. Well, if they don't treat you right you just call for Lisa. Put that one on the house, Ed. An old custom here. Newcomers get the first one on the house. Oh, much obliged. Now.. ...anything else we can do for you? No? Well, maybe later. - Anyway, enjoy yourself. - Ma'am? - You change your mind already? - No, uh.. I just wondered can anybody sit in that poker game? Oh, no one there is particular whose money they take. You wanna play? I wouldn't mind drawin' a few hands. Come on, I'll lead you to the slaughter. John, here is a misguided stranger who wants to join your game. Pull up a chair since you can't do no worse than the rest of us. Except, uh, Squint here that is. Some reason, he just don't seem to be able to lose here tonight. Might as well take your money as well as anybody else's. The game's draw poker. Stakes are what you've got on you. Jacks are better to open and nothing's wild. Three raises $25 limit except the last raise which can be 50. You got it? Got it. Check and raise? Yeah, we check and raise. Alright then, here we go. Just you and me, uh? 'I'll check to you.' I check the one card draw. Can you beat three tens? Let's see 'em. Looks like you win the deal too, Squint. Well.. ...gettin' on, ain't it. Let's make this a-a big one. Seems like they all done pretty big for you tonight, mister. You, uh, you wouldn't be trying to say something, would you? Just deal the cards, that's all. Anything else I got to say will be plain enough for you to understand it. Just watch your step. (McGuire) 'Just keep dealin'.' My, my, ain't we touchy? 'Can you do it, Frank?' With my luck. Ask him. Not here. I can't open but I'll play if anybody else does. Just about the way I feel. It looks like it's up to you, Squint. Well, I'm sorry to have to do this but it looks like old Squint's gonna have to open again. - First is 25. - I swear! I've been in my pocket so much tonight I believe I've worn a hole in it. [Squint chuckling] Twenty five. Call. Here. I call. I'll stay. How many, Frank? I'll take three. Two. One. You guys break this open. Next one. Price is still 25. Well, uh.. ...call and, uh, raise.. ...a dollar. Twenty six to you. Twenty six.. ...and one, twenty seven to you. Call. Seems like a pretty scared bunch of poker players tryin' to use up their raises. Well, there's one big one left. Make it 50. Why do you wanna see the cards? You gotta pay your money. Yeah, he's four flushin'. He's got it. Is that right? Sure, it's right. Look at him. That's what you get for playing with men. - You call? - Not yet. - Wait a minute. - What for? I got money over at the hotel. That don't mean you got it with you. You heard the rules when you sat down. Table stakes, what you got with you. That's right. You got nothing else, uh, a watch or something. I got a pretty good horse over at the livery. Or I'd give my money if you all will wait. [scoffs] Come on, Johnny, he's all through. We ain't playing for any horse at the livery stable? We ain't waitin'. You callin', Tom? Wait a minute. That's worth a good deal more than $50. Well.. ...isn't that a pretty thing? Mm, pistolero's gun. Don't see many of them around. He's right, Squint. That weapon is worth more than $50. 'Good deal more.' Hey, you wanna... bet your play toy. I guess nobody's gonna stop you. Come on, Tom. Call. Read 'em and weep. 'Straight flush. Ace to five of clubs.' Now don't that beat everything you ever saw? - Hold it. - What for? Trouble is you cheated, mister. Ain't nobody ever told you you'd get into trouble talking like that? Just let it lie, mister. You didn't win it. Seems, uh, things get a little tired, ain't it? (McGuire) Yes, it is. Uh, if you wanna leave everything right on the table and walk out of here, I'll try and forget what happened. You crazy? Just who do you think you're talking to? A two bit cardsharp. I've been watching you deal seconds all night long. I've just been waiting for one I can prove. Alright, loudmouth. You keep talking like that, you're just gonna talk yourself right into a great big hole in the ground. You cheated, mister. You never had it worse-- (Squint) 'You're gonna have to kill me to prove it.' 'And you ain't even got no gun.' You know, Squint, I've been wondering about you for quite a while now. Maybe the time's just come to find out a thing or two. - 'You handy with that thing?' - Good enough for him. There's a 50 to cover it. Pick up your gun. Take it easy, Squint. We're gonna do this all fair and square. Tell you the truth, I'm kind of anxious to have a look at them split open as myself. Go ahead, son, pick it up. Take your time. Squint ain't gonna do nothing until you're good and ready. Are you, Squint? Go on, walk out of here. I don't like killin'. Squint, stop it. - Draw, mister. - Sure. [gunshot] Ed. (John) 'He's right.' 'Squint never did have a pair to open on.' - What's your name, young man? - McGuire, Lot McGuire. Then the money is yours, Lot. I'd like to buy you a drink. I don't care much for crooked gamblers myself. It's all the same to you, sir. I'll, uh.. I'll take the drink some other time. Well, when did you get back? About a half hour ago. I don't see many fish around. Well, as a matter of fact, I got several good ones. - I gave 'em to Sally. - Oh, okay. - Say, Sally. - Yes, sir. Uh, could I have some more of this wonderful stew? Yes, sir. Let's have the fish for supper, Sally. - Might taste good for a change. - Alright, ma'am. I, uh, heard you had a killing here last night. I was wondering if I was gonna tell you about it. Uh, this fellow that did it, what does he look like? Oh, nice enough looking. Till he got that pistol out. Had eyes like a sidewinder then. - 'You've seen him before?' - Oh, maybe I have. Fellow like that rode in on me at the river last night. 'Name was McGuire.' 'Lot McGuire.' That's him. You don't seem very upset about it. (Blaine) 'Well, Squint was cheating, wasn't he?' - He's dangerous, Dan. - Yeah. Well, now, maybe I oughta have a talk with this Mr. McGuire. Uh, Sally, you wanna run over to the jail and tell Harry I'd like to see him. Yes, sir. Uh, you think this McGuire is a real mean one? - Yes, I do, Dan. - Hmm. He kinda reminds me of the way I was once. Nothing makes sense to him. Wants to shoot everybody down with a pistol. I bet you weren't like that. Wild maybe, but not like him. How did you know? I think I know. Well, maybe you're right at that. Hi, marshal. This fellow that gunned down Squint, where's he stayin'? I hear he's over at Paco's. Go tell him I wanna see him at the jail, huh? - Sure thing, marshal. - Harry? Don't scare him too much, huh? Oh, come on, Dan. [instrumental music] [knocking] - Who is it? - 'Open up.' What do you want? - Your name McGuire? - That's right. - Lot McGuire? - Who are you? I, uh, I work for Marshal Blaine. Dan Blaine. Reckon you heard of him. I heard of him. Uh, let's get movin'. How's that? Well, the, uh, the marshal would be obliged if you would, uh, stop over to his office when you get the time. You all through delivering your message now? - Yup. - I'll stop by. [knock on door] Yeah? - When? - When I feel like it. Tell Blaine I'll be there when I feel like it. Well, how are you today? Some clown with a tin star said you wanted to see me. Pull up a chair and sit down. - I'll stand. - Sit down, you damn fool. Have a cup of coffee. Look like you need it. - I reckon not. - Why not? I told you before, marshal, I don't wanna owe you anything. You afraid you might not be able to pick a quarrel if you have a drink of my coffee, huh? You know something, Lot, appears to me you got too much conscience for all this gun fighting. 'Cause one of these days, you're gonna feel that you're in the wrong. Then you're gonna lose. Ever think of that? A good pistolero has to be sure of himself. From what I hear, you've killed enough men to know. Some. I've killed some. What do you wanna see me about, marshal? When are you leaving town? When I finish what I came here to do. Now let me tell you something, Lot. If you were to get up out of that chair and were to go into that street and square off with pistols I'd kill ya. That's, uh, big talk, isn't it, marshal? Ordinary fella spoilin' for a fight. I couldn't talk him out of it. I put one in his arm, and one in his leg. But with somebody like you who is fast with a gun I'd have no choice but to kill him before he killed me. And I don't wanna kill you, Lot. I don't wanna kill you because you ain't been born yet. Sit down. Stop acting like a jackass. - I'm not through talking. - Maybe I'm through listenin'. Maybe? You wanna hear the other reason why I don't wanna kill ya? [sighs] Looks like I'm going to whether I want to or not. The reason I don't wanna gun you down is because you ain't a real killer. 'Oh, sure, I know you, uh' 'you can draw that thing real fast.' 'You can hit what you're aiming at.' 'Before long, you killed a man.' Now with a real killer that would be the end. But with you, it'd be the beginnin'. And every time it happened, you'd crawl away somewhere all white and shaky, sick to your stomach. - 'Isn't that right?' - You're doin' all the talkin'. Well, I'm gonna tell you something else. You know shooting that gun won't get any ground plowed up. Won't get any steers raised and won't get any children born. Which makes me good as you. Hell's fire, I am not somebody to be as good as. I am somebody to be better than. What's the matter? Using that gun? Is that the reason for living for you? You really think you can outshoot me with a handgun? Outshoot you, my foot. If you mean can I kill you, the answer is yes. If you mean will I kill you, the answer is still yes. [dramatic music] [instrumental music] Wooo! Hey, where you going all prettied up like that? I promised Marie Webster I'd ride up to see her new baby. Uh-huh. Gonna be gone long? Couple of hours. Hey, Joey, suppose you'd like down out of there. I'll take your job for a while. Yes, sir, Mr. Dan. Mighty pretty little rig she's got there, ain't it? Is that Dan Blaine's woman? Thought everybody in town knew that. Tin star and a pretty woman if that don't beat all. Rich too. It wouldn't surprise me none if Lisa Denton didn't have more money than anybody in this town. - You don't say. - Hmm. You don't say. Well, how did your little talk go? Damn fool's fixing to get his head blown off. Dan, what is it about Lot? I've seen you handle any number of his kind without getting so ruffled. No, not his kind. - What's so different about him? - I don't know. I get the feeling that somehow he could.. - Well, he could be useful. - Useful? I don't see what's useful about someone running around killing people. He's looking for some answers, Lisa. If he found the right one, he could be useful. Oh, what might your name be, partner? I'm Tommy Webster. Ma said I should wait out here and show you the cutoff to our place. Well, looks like we got ourselves a guide. Alright, son, climb on up here. Let's see if you can handle these horses, huh? Can I really drive? Sure. Why not? Alright, you're on your own. Ha! Get on up there. [crying] - Can I pick her up, Marie? - Sure, Miss Lisa. That's just what she's wantin'. Come on, baby. Let's see. Oh, my, you're a big baby. Oh, she's beautiful, Marie. Just beautiful. Aren't you, hmm? Sure glad you came out, Miss Lisa. We don't see many people out here. Well, that being I guess. Dave don't wanna see people much. Does he get on you about it much, Marie? Oh, Dave's a good man, Miss Lisa. Gets onto the liquor sometimes and carries on about it. But that's only natural considering everything. 'One thing's certain, I sure have plenty of time ' to learn about men. I just let him rant it out and the next day, everything's clear. Sure, it is. Yeah. Say, marshal. This here's Charlie. - Hiya, Charlie. - Hi. Charlie wants I should ask you a question. Well, it's better he should ask it then. Is it true, marshal, that you're the fastest man with a gun there is in the whole southwest? Boy, are you crazy to shame your pa by asking questions like that? 'Now if you and your brother don't get out of here' 'I'm gonna cut a switch.' I declare, marshal, I don't know what gets into them boys. I'm downright mortified. Ah, don't be too hard on 'em, Dave. They're good boys. Looks like you're doing alright. You should be mighty proud. Yes, I am, marshal. It's a big country though. Big.. ...mean.. ...lonesome and hard. Seems like a man takes two steps backwards for every one forward. Come on out to the house, marshal, let's see what the old lady's got to eat. Alright. You sure come again, Miss Lisa. Do you hear? I will, Marie. I wanna thank you, Miss Webster. I ain't ate so good in a long time. Well, you're a lucky man, Dave. [indistinct] marshal. [instrumental music] (Lisa) Let's stop here a minute, Dan. It's so peaceful and so beautiful. Do you ever feel we've been cheated, Dan? Like we missed all the things they've got back there. The real things like.. ...watching your children grow up and working for something to pass on to them. No, I don't feel we've been cheated. They're one kind of people, we're another. It's as simple as that. They're no better than us. We're no better than them. Next thing you know, you'll be telling me I'm useful. You think you ain't? What are you talking about? You got that man a real good wife, Lisa. Oh, I know, they didn't have a real fancy church wedding with a choir and organ music and all that. But he.. Man, he got himself a woman. And he wouldn't have done it without your help. That's for sure. You're useful. Now don't you forget it, dear. Well, I still feel I've missed out. What about you, Dan? Are you useful? Uh? [indistinct chattering] I don't see the boss lady around. You got business with Miss Lisa? It could be, friend, could be. Don't hardly seem likely somehow. What's the name? You tend to your business and I'll tend to mine. - Well, she ain't here now. - Huh-hmm. I'll wait. Whisky. [instrumental music] - Comin' in? - No, I don't think so. I'll take the rig back to Ballard and I wanna stop by the office. You're still worried about Lot McGuire. - That's it, isn't it? - Somebody has to. You're gonna have to fight him, aren't you? If he pushes me. 'Can't you just refuse to fight him?' He's nobody. Everybody knows who you are. You don't have to prove yourself to people in this town. If I were to refuse to fight him, every stud in this territory would be in here raisin' hell. - Dan. - 'What?' He couldn't beat you, could he? - No. - 'Are you so sure?' I saw that business with him and Squint. The boy meant to kill him and he was sure before he drew. I'm more sure. I hate him, Dan. I-I wish he was dead. I want him out of this town and out of our lives. I don't care if he goes out breathing or not. You're pretty bloodthirsty, aren't ya? - Is that your boss lady there? - Yeah. Hold on a minute, mister, just because you wanna talk to her don't mean she wants to talk to you. You just stay here. Miss Lisa. Fellow at the bar wants to talk to you. Who is he, Ed? I don't recall seeing him before. Don't know, Lisa. Sure is a mean-lookin' devil though. I suppose I better talk to him. I don't want him upstairs. Give me a minute and then send him back. Sally, go find something to do. Yes. [knock on door] Come in. [indistinct chattering] - You wanted to see me? - Yes, ma'am. - Who are you? - Well, names don't matter none. You might say I'm a friend of Dan Blaine's, an old friend. I doubt that. Anyway, what's it got to do with me? Oh, ain't he your, uh, fancy man? Get out. And fast before I have you thrown out. I wouldn't do that, ma'am. You better listen to what I got to say. - What do you want? - 'Money, ma'am.' 'I need a stake.' And why should I give you money? Well, you see it's like this. Dan Blaine and me, we done some time together up in Territorial Prison few years back. And I got to thinking, it wouldn't do to have that get around now that he's got respectable with a tin star and all that. What's so funny? You are, mister. Thinking you can get me to pay you money to keep quiet about something everybody in this town knows. Now get out. And if I were you, I'd keep moving. The marshal's not gonna feel too kindly about your coming here tonight. 'Oh, ju..' Just a minute. Shut the door. You say you need money. Ma'am, I need money real bad. What were you in prison for? People say I killed a couple of men. [dramatic music] [gunshot] [horse neighs] [gunshots] [music continues] [gunshots] [music continues] [gunshots] [gunshots] [music continues] [music continues] [gunshot] - 'Don't move.' - I ain't movin'. Can't you see I'm shot? I don't suppose you'd like to do me a favor, would ya? - Like you tried to do me? - That was just business. - Who hired you? - What about the favor? What is it? Leave my gun here with me when you go. - Who hired you? - Will you leave the gun? - Yeah, I'll leave it. - You swear? Who? Ah, woman who runs the sporting house. Lisa Denton. - Why? - I don't know. She-she didn't say and I ain't curious. Are you gonna leave the gun? You better round up my horse. You gonna need it. [instrumental music] [gunshot] [music continues] Well, I see you've made yourself a horse trade. - You know this horse? - I shoed him for a fella. Couple of days ago. Medium-size fella. To tell you the truth, I didn't cotton much to him. Matter of fact, I don't cotton much to you either. Well, I'll try not to turn cold in my blankets over that. So you swapped horses, huh? Manner of speaking, Mr. Weeks. Well, well. I'd say I traded my dead horse for this fella's live one. It's a pretty good trade, considering he killed my horse in the first place, of course, by that time he was dead anyway, so.. ...none of it makes much difference, does it? Ah, do tell, do tell. [instrumental music] [speaking in Spanish] [knocking] - 'Who is it?' - Blaine. I was wondering how long it'd take you to get here. Well, now. Appears that you've been dealing in death and destruction again. [chuckles] I figured old man Weeks would let you know about that just as soon as he could hobble up the street. What's this about somebody trying to dry-gulch you? - It's true. - Well, who was it? - I don't know. - Well, what happened? Well, fella up on some rocks he shot my horse off from under me. 'I managed to get to some rocks and we shot at each other some' and...then I got a rifle bullet into him. Found him gutshot and dyin' so I took his horse and came on back to town. You stay there until he was dead? - Yep. - 'Did you bury him?' No. Now why do you suppose somebody would wanna shoot you? I don't rightly know. 'Did you try to find out?' Yeah, I tried to find out. Hmm, that's mighty peculiar. I think I'll ride out and take a look at this fella. I might know him. Come along. Show me the way. I'll meet you at Ballard's stable at 6 o'clock. [knock on door] Come in. Somebody askin' to see you, Lisa. The man who was here yesterday? The man with the beard? No, Lisa. The young fellow who gunned down Squint Calloway. Lot McGuire. - Tell him to come up. - Up here? - You heard me. - 'You're the boss.' [instrumental music] [knocking] Come in. What is it you want? I think you know what I want. I'm not sure that I do. Go on. This afternoon about five miles west of here a man dry-gulched me. He tried to kill me. - Oh! - He's dead now. Why do you come to me about it, Mr. McGuire? I think you know the answer to that better than me. So you said before, what makes you think that? The man said so. Said you hired him to kill me. I wanna know if that's true. And if it is, I'd like to know why? I don't see that there'sany way you could get me to admit that I tried to have you killed. Miss Denton, I'm not much on going to the law. But maybe Marshal Blaine ought to hear what that man said before he died. Why would you do that? You couldn't prove anything. Because I wanna know the answer to a few things. And you're the only one that can tell me and you won't. Now maybe if the marshal got interested, we'd both find out. Could I offer you a drink, Mr. McGuire? I come up here to accuse you of trying to have me killed and you offer me a drink? It's not exactly a social occasion but.. '...since you offer, I accept.' Well? - Well, what? - Do I go to the marshal? Go ahead. He won't believe you without proof. I'll do that. Lot, I hired the man. Yes, ma'am, I figured you did. The man had nothing to gain by lyin'. You won't tell Dan, will you? Not if you tell me why. You honestly don't know, do you? - Don't know what? - About Dan Blaine and me. What about you and Blaine? Well.. You mean you and the marshal have been keepin' company? For a long time now. I love him very much. Well.. ...my curiosity's satisfied. I reckon I can understand how you feel the way you do and why you done what you've done. Don't worry, I won't say nothing to Blaine. 'And that's all. You're just gonna leave now?' Why not? I found out what I wanted to know. Then you don't really understand why I did it, do you? You think I'm gonna pick a fight with Blaine, don't you? Yes. Then it stands to reason you're also afraid I'm gonna kill him. No, it's just the opposite. I'm afraid he's going to kill you. Why is Dan Blaine supposed to be so upset about killing me? I'm nothing to him, just another fella come to town with his gun tied to his leg with a piece of rawhide. Oh, I wish that was true, but it's not. What are you trying to tell me? I guess it's something so simple you just can't believe it. - That bein'? - He likes you. I don't know, but I guess he sees himself in you when he was your age. Maybe. I reckon I'll do what I came here to do in the first place. If you make Dan Blaine fight you, he'll kill you. That's his bargain and he'll keep it. Well, like they say "Best catch a bird before you cook it." Oh, Lot, why did you have to come here? To take the measure of Dan Blaine. A man who's not best at somethin' is dead anyway. The best might not live long.. ...but while he's the best, he's alive. You'll never, never be half the man. Dan, where on earth are you two fellas bound for this early in the mornin'? You're pretty curious, aren't ya? Well, in view of everything, it just seems like you two make a mighty odd pair, that's all. Just gonna take a ride and look around the country. - Isn't that right? - That's about it. (Ballard) 'Well, if you're riding west, you better' keep an eye peeled for Injuns. There were some army fellas through here yesterday looking for that young scoundrel, Pretty Horse. 'It seems like him and three or four other braves' left the reservation a week or so ago. I swear, Ballard, you're gettin' old. Pretty Horse ain't no better than his drunken brother we locked up last week. You make him sound like Cochise. Old man Weeks sure down on Indians, isn't he? Well, he's got a right to be. He lost his wife and child to the Indians back in '55. Boy child. He never knew if they took him along or killed him. I didn't know that. There's a lot of things you don't know. [buzzards squawking] [dramatic music] - Well, I'll be damned. - What's the matter? He's been scalped, that's what's the matter and his pistol's gone. Hmm, maybe Ballard was right about those Indians. Would you get that spade off my saddle? We better bury this rascal before the buzzards get to him. Yeah. Sure a lonely place to lie. You're sure you don't know why he was following you, huh? - Nope. - Seems mighty strange. I told you, marshal, I got no idea. That's a fact. You know I have a feeling you're not telling me the truth. One thing is sure though, he's not gonna do any talkin'. Who was he? Fellow by name of Scarnes, Ernie Scarnes. He's a no good drifter, he'd steal the pennies off a dead man's eyes. We did time together in prison. Didn't know you was in prison, marshal. Like I told you, there's a lot of things you don't know. What you in for? Robbin' a bank. Me and a couple of other fellows, all wild and crazy and all full of ourselves. They both got killed. I got lucky. I just got a bullet in my leg and five years. Five years in prison gives a man a long time to think. You come out and turn a lawman. It's kind of strange, isn't it? No, man either gets smart or gets dead. You know the most dangerous people in the world are the ones that don't benefit by their own mistakes. Like you. You're not gonna rile me today, marshal, not out here away from town and everybody, no point in it. 'Oh, I know, you gotta have the glory' of doing your business in front of a crowd. You seem to know all about it. Well, I know all about winning gun fights and being a big man. But gun fightin' doesn't pleasure me the way it does you. Why don't you just hang it up, marshal? Put your gun away and turn to preachin'. Well, that's my excuse for livin'. See, you don't have one, that's why you're looking to get yourself killed. You know that's the second time you said I'm interested in getting killed. You really think that's what I want? I sure do. And you think you're the man who can do it? Uh, now, don't dirty me up with that talk about who's the best man. God knows you're not much now. I don't know what you'd be if you were the man to shoot down Daniel Blaine in a gun fight. Oh, they'd be coming at you from all over lookin' for a showdown. You know I wish, I wish a thunderbolt would come right down out of that sky and hit you on that thick skull. Maybe drive some sense into it. [gunshot] [dramatic music] [gunshots] I can't make out how many there are from here. [gunshots] Take it easy. You can't see 'em from here anyway. [gunshots] ...so damn anxious to shoot somebody for? You don't know how many there are. You don't know where they are. Look, somebody is trying to kill me. I just wanna do something about it. [gunshot] Pretty bad shootin'. They're not trying to hit us, that's why. Something funny going on. - 'Blaine?' - Now hold it. (male #1) 'Blaine. Daniel Blaine.' Now it begins to make sense. - Yes, this is Blaine. - Who's that? (male #2) 'We see you, Blaine.' Is that you, Pretty Horse? (Pretty Horse) 'It is I, Pretty Horse who speak.' Alright, Pretty, what do you want? (Pretty Horse) 'My brother, White Antelope.' 'You have him locked in dirty jail.' 'In hoosegow.' That's where he's gonna stay until you put that gun down and go home, you hear? [gunshots] Hey, Pretty, suppose we have a parley? (Pretty Horse) 'What parley, Blaine?' What do you mean what parley? A-a-a peace parley, that's what. 'You have whisky?' Now we're gonna get out of here. No, I don't have any whisky. Now, you put that gun down and go on home. I'll see what I can do about your brother. [gunshot] (Pretty Horse) 'Do not move, Blaine.' 'My braves shoot well.' You're gonna get into an awful lot of trouble. (Pretty Horse) 'No trouble, Blaine. You give whisky.' I haven't got any whisky. (Pretty Horse) 'You lie, Blaine.' 'All people know Blaine always have jug of whisky.' You know the old scoundrel's right. I do have a jug in my saddle bag. I make it to be six from here. Now the day ain't come when you and I can't handle six Injuns. Yeah, I was just thinking a drunken Indian is better than a dead one. I'm gonna invite them to have a powwow and have some whisky. They'll drink more than us and we'll just take our chances. Might work. [gunshot] - Hey, Pretty. - 'What, Blaine?' Listen, you want some whisky, you bring your braves down here and we'll talk and we'll have some whisky, you hear? (Pretty Horse) 'You're tricky man, Blaine.' 'You lie to me once before.' 'Then throw me in hoosegow like White Antelope.' You were drunk. I couldn't leave you lying in the street. Somebody'd run over you, now you come on down here and have some whisky. (Pretty Horse) 'We come, Blaine.' Well, if you live through this, you'll see the value of a couple of drinks of whisky. Come on. [instrumental music] Good whisky, Blaine. Oh, that's good medicine, chief. Yes, it takes a good man to drink it. [music continues] [man howling] [drum beats] [chanting] I never thought I'd be part of anything as cockeyed as this. If it weren't for this whisky, they'd have our scalps by now. Come on, let's tie 'em up, huh? [grunts] Thanks. No need to be thanking me. Oh, I don't mind being beholden to you. Besides you gotta save the beast for the ritual slaughter, don't you? I came to your town to find something out, marshal. - I got my bargain too. - 'With whom?' Myself. I reckon we're through talkin'. We are. Now, let's get this critter on his horse. [instrumental music] Uh, did you get those Indians fed? Yeah, they seem pretty quiet now. I guess they were carrying on so much because they were so hungry. Uh, if you want me, I'll be over at Lisa's place. And if they start howling again, you just pour a bucket of water on 'em, right? [indistinct chattering] In a mood to buy a girl a drink? Pour the boss lady a drink. What will it be, Lisa? I have some wine open. No, Ed, make it a whisky. Looks like a whisky night to me somehow. Hmm, it does seem like a whisky kind of night tonight, doesn't it? Why are you looking at me like that? Oh, nothing. Getting to be a stranger here. Now we can't have that now, can we? No, we certainly cannot. What do you figure on doing about it, hmm? Well, you wanna talk about? Why not? Come on. I'll fix that girl tomorrow if it's the last thing I do. Oh, she's just envious, that's all. [instrumental music] One hears he fights tomorrow. The young one. Good thing it's not either you or I. Admit it, Paco, he is brave. And foolish too. [instrumental music] Oh, my love, my love, my love. [instrumental music] [sighs] Can't you sleep, honey? Oh, I'm alright. Now go on back to sleep, there's no sense in us both laying here awake. You're gonna fight him, aren't you? - Yeah. - When? Whenever he chooses. What if he's better than you are, Dan? You know if I thought there was a chance of that I'd turn right over and go to sleep. Why do you bother yourself about him so much? - He isn't worth it. - No, that's not true. - You could be wrong, you know. - Yeah, I could be but I'm not. [sighs] What if he just doesn't show up? Oh, he'll show up. You can count on that. Dan. Why don't we just get out of here tonight? [sighs] Oh, you know better than to talk that way. Come on now. Why can't things be like they were before? God only knows, Lisa. I sure don't. I hear he's faster than lightin'. I heard 10 o'clock tonight. - That what you heard? - Yes. I'd say if Dan Blaine has any trouble with this here pistolero I'll just eat my hat, that's what I say. I wouldn't be too sure of that, Sam. I declare some jackasses sure do love to bray. You better believe it, Ballard. Hee-haw. Hee-haw. Alright, you fellas. Step up for some more whisky now. Hey, Outdoors, that's enough. That's enough! Hey, Lou. What are you gonna do tonight? - Well. - Hey, Sally. Well, what are you looking so glum about? Come on, have a drink. You know I don't drink. And if Miss Lisa comes here and finds you ladies with that liquor, there's gonna be trouble. Oh, Sally, come on. Be a sport. Oh, shut up, Outdoors, and pass the bottle. You wait your turn, Lou. You had plenty. You know why they call Outdoors Outdoors? It is because she has got the big-- Now you shut up, you little one. Oh, yeah? Who's gonna make me? Me. [screaming] Now, you ladies, stop that! [screaming continues] 'Now, you ladies, stop it! Stop it!' Stop it! Stop it! Give me that bottle. I swear everybody's gone crazy around here! [dramatic music] I'm sorry, Miss Lisa. I declare I don't know how them ladies got hold of that liquor. Smell blood just like animals. Shame on you, Miss Lisa. What do you think you're doing drinking whisky at this time in the afternoon? Just leave me alone, Sally. Yessum. Miss Lisa, you ain't got no call to worry about the marshal. He can take care of himself just like he always does. Why, he'll shoot that man plum full of holes! Go find something to do, Sally. Yessum. [instrumental music] (Sally) 'Miss Lisa, what do you wanna do with that thing?' I told you to leave me alone. Now get out! Yessum. [instrumental music] [intense music] [music continues] [indistinct chattering] Mr. Dan. Mr. Dan. Mr. Dan, you better go up to Miss Lisa. She's got a gun and she's gonna do something bad to herself. Don't tell her I told you, Mr. Dan. [gasps] Dan! What were you gonna do with that? Stop a shoot-out. - Why do you wanna turn killer? - You should know why. - You hired Scarnes, didn't you? - No, I didn't. You hired Scarnes to kill Lot McGuire. - No, I didn't. - Don't lie to me. - Alright, I did! - Why? Why? [sobbing] I did it for you. I never thought you'd find out. [sighs] But I did find out, didn't I? [indistinct chattering] [dramatic music] [gunshots] [instrumental music] - Sally? - 'Yes, ma'am.' Go get Dr. Stuart. Bring him to Mr. Dan. Yes, ma'am. [music continues] [instrumental music] [instrumental music]
