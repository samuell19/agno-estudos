JUNE 1934 Villanova. - Business thriving on your corner? - Too late. People gone. - You finished for the night? - No, I'll walk along the harbour till dawn. When your eyes go up, like so, one never knows what one's thinking. You shouldn't make large gestures - you'll rumple your suit. Go and change. Think about your reputation. Villanova's in town. I'm afraid. They'll murder me. Like they murdered the bartender your friend took the rap for. What matters is who killed him. You don't give a damn if they slit my throat, do you? I should have known that. You're not from here. Take me away. If you're right about Villanova I might find out who the killer was. So what? You expect whoever it was to confess to a crime your friend's serving time for? I'll see. I'm scared the customers will see it in my eyes. You know you're lucky to find that one. - You can trust her. - We don't have any choice. You'll have to find another one. They're onto us. I think we know each other. - There was no trouble over that Legionnaire? - Legitimate self-defense. She was only a beat girl. There won't be too many questions. - Roberto, they want to have a talk with you. - What for? - They say that you're more inquisitive than a cop. - That all? - Villanova's running the town. - Happy to hear it. He'd like to be sure you understand. Look at it this way... If you die, you won't be much help to Xavier. Not if I leave town, either. Xavier still has his sister. - When do they want to see me? - Tomorrow. I'm telling you as a friend. Xavier was too much to put up with. - He knew too much. - Hostile, also a very poor loser. Villanova looks like the kind that cheats. I was just about to say that. And Xavier never much liked cheats. - Is Roberto doing anything? - I saw him once. He saw me off from the auberge. - He what? - We talked on the telephone. Everything's planned. It's going well. He's got an inside man. - You know how long it's dragged on? - As soon as we called he came, it's not as easy as you think. He knows I didn't do it, right? Does he believe that? - What? - I said 'yes'! Will you shut that mouth, or do I have to shut it for you? Xavier, stop. - Stop. - I've gotta get out of here. Roberto says don't be so nervous. Use your head. No more advice today, ok? Like Karl, that viscious old goat. I bet he thought up a lot of advice for me. That viscious old goat is paying the lawyer. What more do you want? He rubs your nose in it. I don't give a damn for his lawyers - all they want to do is see me croak. Don't think I don't know that. They're as bad as Villanova and his gang. Georgia, you're wasting your time. It's no place for you. Don't come here again. You see, nothing has changed. I've no business saying this, but I never would've believed it possible you'd stay here. This far away, with that old goat, Karl. I could swear I was hearing Xavier. - Is that so odd? - No. I'll tell you someday. But then old Karl really knows how to do things. The guards think of him as a monster. And with me, he could be monstrous or pleasant, you never know. I know all too well. I raised the boy. If he's not hurting someone out of meanness, it's out of stupidity. Ah, there's your wife... with Borgo. We keep our distance. - Mr. Meier, I heard you were here. - Roberto was waiting outside the prison. Meier, I'd almost forgotten. I owe you 6,000, don't I? Let me take care of it. Always in control, huh? - The situation's somewhat... - Yes, awkward, I know. However I wouldn't have come, unless it was urgent. - Xavier told his sister you wanted him to plead guilty? - Yes. - But he's innocent. - That's still not proven. How's it going? I'm doing what I can. Better hurry. We go to court in just three months. If he pleads not guilty, he could end up with life, hard labour. In the eyes of the law, an admission is a sign of repentance. We get off with ten years. In the law's eyes you should admit to a crime you have committed? His police record is a mile long. That's what you'd call normal. His upbringing certainly wasn't normal. That's all evidence. Yes. A little humility in court would help. If he were repectful it would be impressive... ...A thief's son, deprived of education, etc. It's more than that. A community of thieves and prostitutes, whose kids were raised by a confidence man. That bastard. This is more than an old barnyard. Some weird things happened here. That's evidence. My old man died in prison. Theirs died shooting his way out of a bank. Some parents used to visit the place, now and then. Karl collected until they died. And then took what was left over. And we got whipped for an inheritance. Tell me... Do you really think the jurors will weep over that? Stop it Roberto, that doesn't help. When you've got the proof, that's all that's needed. They'll have to let him go. Say goodbye to your husband for me. - I'll do my best. - Go and see my brother tomorrow. - I was just there! - So what? Say no matter what it takes, you'll get him put of there. Last night they got rid of the girl I was counting on. You'll have to do a lot of lying to Xavier. Keep him calm. You want me to replace her? They wouldn't know me. - No, it's too risky. - You're warning me of risks? Oh yes. Did you come to take her from me? - I'm old enough to make my own decisions, now. - Goodbye. I'll be in touch. Listen... I want to say this in front of you, and him. He means a lot to me. When you and Xavier left, I had it rough. I took up with the worst kind. I even went to jail with them. And when I got out, I went with him. Because he was kind. The only one who was kind. For a woman it's important. The old pay for young flesh. You don't owe him a thing. 'The Scoumoune', eh? Right... A bearer of bad luck, an outcast. A jinx. 'Scoumoune' it's a sort of nickname we used in Italy. In the old days. And today? I doubt if he'll bear up under his bad luck. - One's nickname means nothing. - You're nicknamed 'The Dandy', aren't you?. - Fits you well. - We'll soon see how 'the Scoumoune' fits in. Not much longer to wait, either. Xavier knew more than he should. I won't make the same mistake with this one. He'll pack his bags... ...or he'll die. He'll die will he? You've already tried to kill him. Yes, but today...it's me. Villanova and associates. - And we all wanted to meet you. - Charmed. You know you took one of our women. Did I now? Thanks to him, we're willing to overlook it. If you leave town. Since when is trying to get a friend out of jail forbidden? Since you interfered with us. Then it's forbidden. You're going to leave town in one hour. You don't know how happy I am here. Pity we can't see eye to eye. Don't move. Put it down there. - You too. - Me? - I never carry one. - You're much too smart for that. I've acted as go-between for you and them, but... ...I don't want to see the rest. You were warned. Is the man who killed the girl at my place, ...the same one who killed the bartender, whose body you placed in Xavier's car? I don't know anything. Only one man could really have answered that. That's true, because he kept everything in his head. What do we do with the body? You guys know a place? - No. - Yes, I know one. A mineshaft in the hills, it's over 100 metres deep. It'll do. At sun-up. To think my father eaked out his living down in that hole... Toss some of those on top. Conspiracy to conceal a corpse. That'll get you twenty years with a good lawyer. - Why do you say that? - We're all in the same boat now. Associates, if you prefer. It's liable to cost me a lot of money to spring my pal. So I'll collect all the receipts from the girls and the Circle, until further notice. Any objections? How do we explain to the staff, and to our clients...about this? Tell them he sold out to me. And he eloped with his girlfriend. His hometown sweetheart. The love of his life, you know... There's a lot that we never knew. He never told us he was going to do in Xavier. We'd tell you if we knew what went on. I swear we would. It wouldn't have cost us quite as much, either. Hey! Watch it! Dammit. My new suit. - How much? - 2,000. It tops yesterday. - No, no, it's ok. I trust you. - You may. - My wife keeps on the straight and narrow. - That way her husband can't go over the edge. 500 francs. No more bets. Pretty sharp. Maybe the shoulders bunch a little, but... - Have you gone crazy? - Get out of here. - What's that? - None of that stuff in my place, pal. Look, Fanfan, you picked the wrong night. - This your place? I didn't know. - Well now you know. - Are you playing? - I would, but... Here. Take this from me - it'll bring you luck. Be careful of guys like him. They're always good for laughs, but they'll turn on you one day. We'll lose every cent. You want the machinery switched on? Yes, switch it on. Brand new tables, well rigged up. And Xavier discovered them. - Villanova was a tightwad. He refused to split the take. - Put yourself in his place. I'll put you in on top of him. - He reminds me of a rat. - Yes... A rat that's found a big piece of cheese. I've known rats that have died of indigestion. Goodnight, sir. - Yes? - He still there? No, he just walked out. He had the receipts with him, as usual. There's a guy called Cipriano, asking for Villanova. He's been here twice. He's telephoned. He had an appointment with him. - Where's he from? - Spain. Will you go to bed! I've just talked to him again. I'm going to see him at the old harbour. Near the dry docks. It's quiet there. - When? - Right away. - At six in the morning? - He's in such a hurry, I think we should take a chance. He's dead? Yes. One of my oldest friends. I was expecting to see him soon. He's dead. I'll don't believe it. It's hard to believe. - How? - Someone shot him in the back. - Yeah, who was it? - A man we'd never met. - For a woman. - For appearances, we kept the cops out of it. He's bled us white ever since. The dog. As far as the business goes, we've had it. You'll never get your money back. Your investment in The Circle. It's not a question of money. - Have you made your decision? - Decision? You mean like killing him? We would've done it already if we weren't so well known. Well, you know it all. It's really been a great pleasure to meet a friend from poor Jeannot's childhood. Wait. I can help you. In what way? - I'm willing to kill him. - You mean that? - Really? - His habits? He comes to the club at about eleven, and almost never leaves till it's time to close in the morning. But always with the evening's take. The receipts. I'll be there at eleven. When he arrives, point him out. Yes, with pleasure. I'll tap him on the shoulder. She knocked on my door, and I said: ''Come in, dear... my jewel , my princess, my precious lotus blossom''. My door opens, and it's the cops. An army of police. All in their unform, like they were on parade... They drag me off to prison not far from Draguignan... I'm meeting him at his hotel. And if he asks about me, just say one of the other clubs was raided and I went to see about it. Seems dirty, somehow. To think I'm in business with a goddamn fashion plate. I am sick of you winning! I'm not going to pay, you bastard. I'm not paying! - Let's not have such bad manners. - So you want to join in? Just mind your own business. Mind your own business! Champagne for everyone. For him too. Where I come from we call him the ex-communicant. In the South, it seems it's the Scoumoune. A jinx in any language. All in all it's rather comical. Don't you think? You'll be the only one left to laugh, soon. I was so sure you'd avenge a friend. A childhood friend. Life comes first though. And I won't gamble mine when the chances are only one in a hundred. His chances are no more than one in a hundred. How can you lose? He's not bulletproof, you know. Not from behind, anyhow. - You've forgotten the Mexican. - The Mexican? Ah, sure, the musician. He's always on guard in front of The Circle. Anyone shoots from behind, he'll take care of 'em. Hello. A porter, please. So you're backing out? He's called the ex-communicant, and you're leaving the fold? Right. And I feel no shame. You could never use your brain the way he does. Neither one of us could. - What are you doing here? - You had us all worried on account of the raids... - ...though they never came off. - Yes, I know. Seems my friend was wrong. Just a false rumour. Oh, you heard a false rumour? It's fatigue. Too much work. So, you're going to the country, with your wife. - She'll enjoy going somewhere to relax. - But who's going to manage the girls? Her... This is Georgia, she's Xavier's sister. I'd like you to meet one of the greatest friends your brother ever had. Always nice to meet a friend of my brother. - Look, about Xavier I can help... - You know very well you can't. Stop stalling for time. You're going to sign this. A contract that formally allows us to run the house in your absence. The Dandy will go on looking after The Circle. He'll give you the nod when you're to return. - Go on girls, go to bed. - Good luck with Granny. Up yours, bitch. Gimme another one. - Madame? - You'd better go to bed. Get lost, you cheap little tart! I pay. I'm a good whore, and when I drink, I pay. We're fed up with your goddamn... 1750 tonight. Being alone upsets her. Want to go up with her? - You take me for a boyscout? - Ha! Should've known. - How's it going? Any trouble with the girls? - No, none. Karl telephoned. He'd like to go to the trial. Tell him to go to the theatre. The show's not quite as good, but they have velvet covered seats. If Xavier's acquitted, Karl seems to think I'll come back. And what do you think? With you I never know. I found Xavier a good place to work. On the coast of Brazil. Someone I know who cans lobster. He's selling the company. All Xavier will do is sign letters. With a stamp, so he won't sign the wrong name. That way he won't get too tired, either. - And what'll you do? - Oh, I don't know. I never know in advance. And us? - Well, we're together, aren't we? - Yes, but... But what about after...later... When is later? Will the Court please rise. We tried for all or nothing. - He better be with us this evening, huh? - Otherwise it's a grey denim outfit. I can see you in a striped suit. You'd wear it with distinction. Will the accused please rise. As the jury is unanimous in its opinion, it is my duty to announce the verdict of this court. That the accused, Xavier Saratov is found guilty of manslaughter. And is hereby sentenced... - ...to twenty years hard labour. - You bastard, I'm innocent! You know I'm innocent, you bastard! Guards, take the prisoner into custody! Don't think about it. Let's go. Piece of shit! Clear the courtroom! - I'm afraid it's the grey denim outfit. - Pity. Roger! Roger! - The fort at Bellegarde? - They transferred him yesterday. - It's a terrible prison. - Don't worry, it won't be for long. There's no hope for him until he's eligible for parole though. I'll check it out on the spot. There's one advantage - it's at the Spanish border. Stop looking so glum. You'd think you had to serve his term. In Paris things are bad. The workers are battling in the streets with the police. It's the Popular Front. There's talk of revolution. We don't have the right to vote, so it's no concern of ours. Life's short. Come on. Come on. You think it's too expensive? Well look what you get for your money! Come on, touch those beauties, they're the real thing, right? You can't go back to the missus without your hat! What do you think you're doing? We're not open! Don't you understand? We're closed! No, amigo, no. Wine... - They'll be back. - We'll take care of it. You've got to call Roberto. Look, when I accepted this job I knew the problems, so we're not calling Roberto. You know what we say: ''Call for help while you still have a tongue''. If you refuse to, then I must call. Hey, hello. - Not bad, freedom, eh? - Yeah, makes you feel dizzy though. - How long were you in? - 15 years. - Do you know an Xavier Saratov? - Russian fellow? Sure, I worked next to him, stitching sacks. He's a friend of mine. There's the dormitory. Courtyard around it. At night, the guards make the rounds every two hours. They begin here, and end over there. They carry pass keys to open all the doors. - Thank you. I would've done it for nothing though. - There's a lot more in it for Oh, you can count on me. The old American protection game. They tear the place to pieces, disappear into the night, ...and the next day tell you how wise you would've been to pay, if you don't like having your affairs messed with. As for the police, they sit on their butts and keep score. They want the gangs to keep filling the cemeteries, ...that way they keep filling the prisons with whoever's left alive. - And where were the other owners when this went on? - Survival of the fittest. No-one needs to tell you that. I have the feeling that the Americans know it too. And the girls go where the muscle power is. You should've seen them... - We'll have to close. - That's something I can't afford. Tonight we'll open The Clack and tomorrow The Circle. As soon as all this is straightened up. So then, you're going to pay off the negroes? Yes...I'll pay them. The girls. The girls is me. Roberto. - Well? - Legitimate self-defence didn't play. How many? Twenty years, as well. It's my fault. I shouldn't have dragged him into it. They've got us making funeral wreaths, could be worse though... After a while you get used to it. We even laugh about it now and then. You should be learning a trade. Some occupation. What kind of an occupation is that? The Dandy and the rest are taking care of business... Migli seems to have disappeared, and I'm back with Karl again. - I have the feeling that's where I should stay. - You tell him hello from me. Roberto was silent throughout the trial, and when it was over he said... ''Looking back at my life, I'd be amazed if it ended at the Sorbonne''. I shouldn't have dragged him into it. Hey, over there! You sleeping? Wake up! Come on! Hey, did you hear me? You're here to work! Hold it, hold it... Xavier don't be a fool! We've got a tough customer here. This one gets special treatment. Look at my boots. There's only one law here. That's me. Only two ways of getting out. You walk out the front door, or we carry you out the back door. - You understand? - Yes. What you meant to say, was ''Yes, Sir''. Yes, Sir. Your first week's your apprenticeship. After that you've got to work like the others. My name's Freddy, I heard a lot about you. I'm in for petty theft, but I killed a cop once. Congratulations. - Do you know Xavier Saratov? - Do I? He's one of the stars of the show. - Where does he work? - He doesn't work. Solitary. He's been there months now. Every time he's due to get out, they clap him back in. I swear they're trying to kill him. - You're a born artist. - I believe in quality. Besides, you never know which one they'll pick out for you. - Not for me - I'm immortal. - Oh good. That's where they come out. One of them will be Bonaventure, the one who told me I was immortal. Because I have a lifeline that's perfect. - Why was he in solitary? - He's a sleepwalker. You can see what happened - that lose of a guard thought he was making fun of him. - My pal, Bonaventure. - This is Borgo. - You see Xavier down there? - No. They don't even let him out to piss these days. You used to hear him holler. But now... - Of course the Blackwad's not only a bastard, he hates his guts. - Why? To start with, on account of the guard Xavier kicked around. But mainly for the cat. The cat belonged to the Blackwad and came on his rounds till she disappeared. Her hide was found in Xavier's cell. I don't think I could ever get that hungry! The Blackwad, he tried to stuff the hide down his throat. What a circus! Look at his lifeline - it's not only short, it's all screwed up. Doubt if you'll ever see him again. Do you happen to know of a good doctor? You know, first class? A doctor eh? - And you? - Two weeks for peddling tobacco. - You? - Four days for mouthing off. The same thing. - A week for refusing to walk around the yard. - Why? I've got flat feet. Besides, the sun's too hot. Hmmm, you're a smartass. Hey, your stuff's outside the door. Listen, I said your rag's in front of the door. Get your arms out against the wall. Put your palms out flat. That you?...Is that you? No, it's the Count of Montecristo. Go on, put your paw out for the gentleman. Don't you want to shake? Let's say it never happened. If anyone asks, you tripped over a piece of iron. Now he's out of solitary Xavier's got his strength back. Besides he's on the same work crew as Roberto. We must wait. Prisoners... - This morning France declared war on Germany. - Great. Do you think they'll let us join? In this dark hour, it is your solemn duty, ...to maintain exemplary discipline . Things won't change much for us. As of midnight, a a state of marshal law went into effect... ...throughout the entire land. - What's your unit? - The Second Sudanese, Sir. - The best of luck. - Well, to tell the truth, I wouldn't mind trading places. - Mr. Garnier, welcome back. - Ah, you see there's still life in the old boy. - I would've thought they'd parole you after all these years. - No, sir. Oh lads - I've known him for twenty years, he's a decent as they come. You know sir, we requested permission to join. Do you think the Government will come through? Well, in 1914 I'd just been hired as a guard when they declared war, ...the whole outfit asked permission and never heard back. I hate to say it, but it's true. - Mr. Dubois. the wreaths aren't ready for you yet. - We're done for now. It's the end. The French army was defeated in a few days. I can hardly believe it. ARMISTICE SIGNED TODAY. The Germans, the Yanks, the British, they're all the same... You can be damned sure none of them will let us out of here. I wasn't counting on them. - Who are you counting on? - On a guy, but you've got to wait. Wait? Don't make me laugh. You know I'm innocent. Think about it. I wouldn't drive around with a corpse in my car. I never had any reason to kill the guy. But think about all the guys you did kill for a reason. It averages out. - You see that? - Disgusting. - It'd make you sick. - Look at mine. - Bastards. - It's rotten. - Slag! - It's disgusting. I could be sick! Where's that sonofabitch cook? Let him eat this shit! - Yeah, you said it, it's a lot of shit! - Stay down! We're not going to win this way. She's left Karl. It's a friendly separation. She bought her own place in Perpignan. A small bar. ''I'll be much closer for visiting, so I'll come every week now... ...and tell Roberto that I live all alone. Getting food is more and more difficult. On some days...'' - It's him. - It's who? - The one we're waiting for. - Sounds like a troubador. Migli! - There's the boss now. - Morning, men. Hello. - How's things? - Okay. That's what I call impressive, what do you think? A man who would die like that. From out of nowhere. Takes a lot of faith, huh? You see? He wasn't just a troubador. Listen. At the next visitors period... ...get it across to Georgia, she should buy you some chocolate, any crap like that... ...at this address. He's our ordinance supplier. You also tell her to buy you a pistol. A .38. - A pistol? - I'll explain. They're in the resistance. So many of them, they don't know where to put them. The women's quarters I guess. Even gun 'em down in the streets. - Ah, at least we can sleep nights. - You're right - that's what I said last time I spoke to my sister. I saw her. She's pretty good looking. I thought she was your wife. My wife won't be coming. I killed her. Irreconcilable differences. Have you got it? Outside a lot of folks don't even have that much. There are lines everywhere, for bread and meat... Your poor old mother wrote a very touching letter, you know. She'll send her thanks. Well thanks a lot. I'll put all this away. Hey, go get the old scavenger. Want some homemade cookies? For chewing on in the can. Lousy work, just look, it's all twisted. What do you expect, he's not a professional. Here. - That's pretty good stuff. - Club foot Charlie's perfect. Like every cripple, he wants action. He was impressed with the way Migli died. You know, I can't wait to get that gun in my hand. You won't have to dream much longer. These are the new men. Wait there in the yard. You'll all be assigned a job with the others. Fanfan. - Visiting the region? - You said it. - You know Xavier? - Sure, we've seen each other at the clubs. - You draw a bad card? - It's on account of The Dandy. - That clothes peg went too far. - And so you killed him. That's right. One word led to another, until finally... There you go. Stupid, I guess, but I do miss him. I've been in three years, I still have two more to go. - And you? How far are you? - Twelve to go. Fourteen. So, you're the two warehousemen? The wreath dealer isn't coming anymore. I may as well tell you. He was arrested by the Germans. The workshop will continue to operate until the supplies are exhausted. After that we'll see. Each day you'll submit a written progress report to the chief accountant. You may go. - All we needed was a breach and a few screws. - And we'd be free. You should see the change in mentality out there. All Gauls in two halves now, the Gestapo or the Resistance. - Where's all the dough? - The Gestapo has the right to pillage. As for the Resistance, heaven rains dough on their heads. In parachutes. If you're sharp, your work's cut out for you. They made this coffee out of old cardboard. - Georgia? - Who else? - It's funny. - You think so? - Remember, we're in stir, whatsmore I'm innocent. - Cut it out, you'll make me cry. Collaborators. Now it's their turn. Resistance or collaborators, what's the difference? It's always the same people that guard you. - And who judge you. - Don't talk about judges. The Germans... ...on departing, have left us... ...with much of our land bristling with explosives. The Ministry of Justice, views the situation... ...as an opportunity to offer clemency to out penal community. Those who volunteer for this clean-up campaign... ...will be exonerated, in large degree... ...in relation to the danger that they've run... ...and the results they've obtained. You may submit your applications to me at any time. I'd have to be desperate to take a bet like that. - I don't give a damn. I'm immortal. - Yeah, we'll see. Look, you guys, only a mutton-head's gonna get his head blown-off, right? This one's ready for you. All okay? Yes, okay... The boys at the flea market would've snapped this up. - Hey. This up to your standards? - It'll do. Xavier! It's over there. Hey! It didn't touch me! Not a scratch! I didn't get hit! Not a scratch you guys! Nothing! Move! There's too many goddamn empty places. For the love of Christ. - I'm quitting. - Quitting? You'll be sent back inside. - I don't care. - Ok, get your things together. - I thought you said he was immortal. - That's why he's leaving. - He won't make a liar out of me then. - Why don't you read Roberto's palm? - Sure, why not. - No, it's not for me. - Thank you. - Did you see him? - Yes - You're a lot luckier than we are. - I'm sure your son's on the other side of that dune. - To think their day is just beginning. - Let's go. It's Freddy. It's his leg. This ain't no teabreak. - She's all yours. - Not yet. - The detanator's underneath. - It's easy, just reach behind and you've got it. - You turn her around, I've gotta see. - It's slipping! I can't! That thing weighs at least 50 kilos, you know that! If it slips I can't help it. I'm a technician. I'm not blowing myself up. Okay. Here, have another one. - I hear they had to amputate both his legs. - That's what old sawbone said. - That deserves a full reprieve. - Great, he can beg for a living outside churches. Yeah, and in cemeteries, hospitals. All those cheery spots. - I bet they give him a medal. - That might get him a job as a janitor, if he's lucky. Listen, suppose it's the last one. It might be written there. - I'm not in good form today. - Hey Xavier, you see... - Where is he? - He went that way. Xavier! - Are you nuts? - Bullshit! Get back, will you! Xavier, leave it alone goddamn it! - I thought we'd made a deal. - We changed our minds. I see you've taken someone's advice. But your advisor won't pay the bills. Nor for protection. Not anymore. That's your final word? Yes. Grégoire, open the safe. Ah, you've been minting it during the occupation, and you don't want to be reasonable. I hope it's all there. Otherwise we'll have to get tough with you. - Who the hell are you? - I'm paid to keep order, so I'm keeping order. Pass the money. Go out the back way, would you please? I'll see them to the door and wait below. - You know, he's really good. - I know, perfect. If your sidekick dies, invite me to the funeral. - You think they'll come back? - I hope you know how very much that was appreciated. - And Benda? He'll live, won't he? - We'll see. If you get in before me, tell Georgia I stayed here. You're right - for all the good I do here. - That was too much for me - I'm going to bed. - Me too. My chaufeur's here, I'll take you home. - See you tomorrow - you were great. - Make yourself at home here, anything you want. I mean that. - Yes, they're both here. Go inside, you'll find them. - Thank you. Hello, Xavier. I heard you were in the neighbourhood. You were lucky, it could've been much worse. Some never came back. Besides, your right arm's still ok - you could've lost that. I was left-handed. - No, I'll do it myself. - Goodnight. In Marseilles everything's out of hand now. Between hoods and hookers nobody's safe. You can't trust anyone. We could see that when we got out. It's alright here. The owners are generous. They keep the girls happy... ...but they're much too soft. Hell, there's a job available here, if you're free. Really? Well yes, with pleasure. Well, just keep an eye on what comes in, and what goes out. - That won't wear me out. - Why should you wear yourself out? - How's Xavier? In good spirits? - Could be a lot better. - I bumped into an old pal. - I already prepared his room. Xavier said he was coming along. I think I met you once or twice, long ago. - Things have changed. - You haven't changed at all. He put his fist through it. He went out saying he'd much rather be dead, than alive with one arm. He's out making the rounds of Pigalle. Roberto, there's no way out of this neighbourhood, we're trapped here. We've got to do something. Get out. I don't know how or where, but we've got to try. I should make more sense, shouldn't I? It's idiotic. Not a bit idiotic. Hi sweetie, you all alone? - Lose your arm in the war? - None of your business. Get your ass outta here. Huh. Big deal. What's wrong? They haven't come back? - No. - Ah, well, it can't be serious. It might get that way though. Read. - A sales contract for my part ownership of the cabaret? - It's quite legal - a lawyer drew it up. For that amount? It's ridiculous. - If it weren't they'd ask me where I got the money from. - You're joking. Do you know what the club is worth? After all, we've paid you extremely well. Scoumoune, what you're proposing is... I mean, I thought of you as a friend. If it'll be of some help to you. All the pages. You expect me to do the same? Yes, it settles a past debt. If you don't pay with that, you'll pay with this... - Pretty damned expensive present. - The idea's to stay alive. Go my treasure. Tonight you'll knock 'em dead. Flattery's cheap. The nicer you treat them, the bitchier they are. And you seem like a nice guy to me. - What do you think of my new suit? - Not bad. Not bad? You know what the boys call me? Jeannot, The Dandy. If ever I can be of service to you, just say the word. I'd like to present the new proprietor of the joint. Buy cheap, sell expensive. - What's wrong with you? - Nothing. You see that guy over there? Calls himself Jeannot, The Dandy. He thinks I'm nice. - You want to be of service to Fanfan? - Yes. Then never come back here. You remind him of a sad encounter with another Dandy. I suppose it has to happen sooner or later, but later would be preferable. - Okay. - He'll be grateful. I'm selling the caberet, and I'm buying this. Georgia doesn't like the city. It'll be better for Xavier too. It adds a new dimension. I hate the business we're in. How about you? You could say so. Have you shown Xavier and Georgia the place? No. Not till I know I have it. You'll look swell here, wearing a top hat, looking through binoculars at your horses. Madame Stern's here. She's waiting for you. Only two hours from Paris, the ocean nearby, and plenty of space... Tomorrow's dream today. We told you, we haven't seen him today. I can't find a thing. He must have hid it somewhere else. Who hid what? Explain yourself, shit. - The title deed for the cabaret. - The cabaret doesn't belong to us. - Look boys, you've got the wrong address. - We know better. - This time every morning he's always here. - Good thing for you he's not here this morning. We know the type. We've liquidated tougher customers than your pal. - Aren't you a little worried about where he is? - We don't worry easily. - You don't suppose we'd tell you where he is, do you? - Course not, pops. When you have a chance, tell him to send the deed to Roche, notere in Saint- Étienne. - I'll deliver the message. Is that all? - No, the lady comes with us. - We'll return her when we get the papers. - Out of the question. She's not involved in this. She stays where she is. Fire, kid. You'll be doing me a favour. Step aside. At least let her take her coat. Frisk it. Nevermind. Roberto will straighten it out. Georgia, the window! Come on, hurry. This one you know. It's Saratov. You want to see him? Well, that's that. What do you think of it? For a man with only one arm he can be proud of himself. Don't go too far. They'll want you for questioning. At least ten people saw him 100km from Paris when it happened. They won't ask too many questions. - And the broad? - What do you expect? She's in a state of shock, amnesia, the whole business. There are two of them left, one of them wounded. I've got to find them before Georgia gets out. Where will you find them? They're new guys. They come from nowhere. Nobody knows who they are. - Everybody casts a shadow. - Not these guys. You'd be smarter to forget them. Besides, you're sick of this business, remember. Too late for me to do anything else. Remember to visit Georgia every day in the hospital, will you? Will you listen to me? Times have changed, without Xavier and Migli there's no-one to cover your back. Don't you worry, I'll keep my back to the wall. Xavier? I'll take care of it. Shit. A prince.
