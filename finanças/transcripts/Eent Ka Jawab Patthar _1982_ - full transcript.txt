Whatever you want to say... ...Tell it in the court. In the evening of 6th of October. The accused, Madhav Singh, Because of a personal grudge. Held a gun in his hand and. Went to the bungalow of Chowdhary. Nitraj Singh and very cruelly killed. Two of the men of Nitraj Singh. It a such a serious crime when. A person takes the life of. Another person. Humanity is absent there. So I would make an appeal to the court. That according to article 302... ...Such a dangerous criminal should be. Given death sentence. This advocate must know that. Until the crime isn't proved... ...He can't accuse anyone at the court. Objection sustained. - Thank you, My Lord. - Next. - The first witness. - Mr. Sevak Mewalal. Mr. Sevakada. The court wants to know from you That. How the accused, Madhav Singh has killed Ramu and Jappu. Your honour, in the evening of 6th October... ...I was passing by the bungalow. In my Pope Paul's Lincoln Continental Car. What do I see... That, Madhav Singh. Is aiming his gun. So I stopped my car. And just on seeing, he shot. Two pellets from his gun. And Ramu and Jaggu died at the spot. My Lord, if I am to say the truth Then I have seen it from my eyes that. Madhav Singh killed Ramu and Jabbu. Sir, I tried to stop him a lot. But he shot twice in a second And both of them. Died, Sir. I was praying to God. I heard the sound of a gunshot. When I came out, I saw. That Madhav Singh has killed Ramu and Jaggu. In the evening of 6th October. After being informed by Chowdary Mitra Singh. That Madhav Singh has attacked in the Bungalow. With some dangerous motive. I reached there with some of my Men and saw that. That Madhav Singh has. Killed Ramu and Jaggu. Don't lie with the police uniform Inspector. Next. - Chowdhary Nitra Singh. - Your Honour, Madhav Singh was. Seen murdering those. Two by me. Liar! But keeping my client's emotion In mind I can't stop telling this My Honour. That whatever is going on. Is a framed story. This is such a conspiracy that. An innocent is being. Targetted. Therefore. To uncover this conspiracy. I want permission to bring up Two witnesses. Lakshmi Devi and Sarala Devi, My Lord. Permission granted. Thank you, My Lord. Tomorrow you are going to. Give testimony before the court This certificate'll help you. And the baby that is in your womb. Can easily be blamed on Madhav Singh. And what about our marriage? Why are you worrying about it? I am in a hurry more than you. Here this case would end and. There we would get married. So. That your fiance was risking his life Because he wanted to protect your dignity. I myself know how to protect my dignity. Be truthful in front of the court Lakshmi Devi. This is not about your dignity. But the life and death of your fiance. My fiance is my feeling, Lawyer. And my dignity is my modesty. And modesty is always higher than feeling. Do you want. That I would murder the truth in the court And tell a lie. Lakshmi! Lakshmi, you also favour these people. - [THUD] - Order! Order! Mr. Ram Singh, your witness. No questions, your Honour. Next witness please. Miss Sarala. In the evening of 6th October. You went to Madhav Singh and said. That Chowdhary Nitra Singh. Has kidnapped Lakshmi. And on hearing this, he went with you Is it right? No. I never went to his home. So, was he mad? To take the gun and go to Chowdhary Nitraj Singh's bungalow. There must be some reason. Yes, of course. And that was. Because he didn't want his secret to be Flashed. Which secret, tell clearly Miss Sarala. Madhav loved me since long. And this secret was only known by Nitraj Singh. I was about to be the mother of Madhav's child. But when Madhav dumped me for Lakshmi. Then Nitraj Singh. Threatened to tell this secret to Lakshmi's Brother. So that a women's life doesn't get ruined. This is totally a lie, Judge. - What wrong have I done, Sarala? - Order order. Mr. Krishna Ram. Do you have to ask anything else From Sarala? Nothing, Your Honour. According to the case's progress and the Witness's statements. The court has decided. That accused Madhav Singh, be declared A convict. In the murder of Ramu and Jabbu. According to the article 302 of the Constitution. He is given a sentence of Life Imprisonment. Convict number 410. Madhav Singh has absconded from. [RUNNING FOOTSTEPS] The jail. You bastard. It is easy to escape from jail. But it's very difficult to get out from the Clutches of Inspector Sher Singh.

To kill him. No! We don't have that permission. Shut up. Do you know to whom are you speaking to? - Yes officer. - So, be away from here. Both of us have the same path, Sir. The Law doesn't give you this Permission. That we take someone's life. Our only responsibility is to. Hand over the convict to The law. To punish him or. Take away his life... - ...Is the work of the court. - Don't teach me Man Singh. - I understand the law very nicely. - Not more than me Sir. Before becoming a Police... ...I was an advocate.

By taking all his weath. Handed him over to king. Choudhary Sher Singh should have more knowledge about this. Nawab, Sher singh is a police officer. I'm suprised that a police offier like me, commands are not not taken. My lord, you also don't know that. That for knowing who gave poison to his father, king. Has given so much to Maan Singh. - What are you saying? - I'm telling the truth. And the remaining secret will also be revealed to you. - What? - Yes. It's been a long time since I met him, Nawab.

Your highness [CHUCKLES] I welcome you will all my heart. Nathu Singh's fortune will shine now, as you have come here. Tell me what I have to do. Mushtaq. - Yes your highness. - Do you have the picture? So much can be made from Bhutto Bhavindar kaur, bhupathi rao, bhupath singh. Tell me is it a male or female? I can tell the rest by seeing the picture I can say. This is my prince, Bhutto's picture. Bhupi. He is the famous pocketpicker, Revello from Mumbai. - Pocketpicker? - Yes he pickpockets. - What are you saying? - I'm telling the truth I have met him many times in jail. - Are yo sure? - You tell me I believe that. If there is mistake in piture, then I don't know I'll tell you with accuracy if I see him face to face, You an cut my head then. Okay. Prince Bhupi will be billard room. Good shot. Hey! Balveer? Get out! Bye bye. My love. After getting you I have got the entire world. Truth. And me? After I come in your embrace I forget everything. I feel like. That in entire world. That you and me are there. - Truth. - Yes. And you. But. Not so soon. Our happiness each moment. Can destroy my life. No. 'I have done bad things in my life.' 'And today I'm going destroy a nice girl's life.' No. Go away. Are you upset with me? Leave me in my state. Go away. Go. Please go. [WHIMPERS] Hey you prince pickpocket. I'm your old friend. You have not given my part of share in your quest. Shut up you bastard. Bastard! When one's death comes, he gets stucked up in all ways. Even if I wish I was thirsty of someone's blood. - Understood? - Stop. [GUNSHOT] He doesn't have connection with our business. But with our emotions. You command. I will serve you. Let it be your emotion. Or your business. You should try once I'll try my best. Not only trying, Maan Singh. This is about respect. King, are you hinting at. - Prince Bhupi? - Yes you understod it correctly. In this entire world. You can understand the delicacy of this situation. Because you have seen the past. And today's situation as well. In the past, Madhav Singh named man... ...was a victim. And in today's. Prince Bhupi is accused of killing. King. Why are you so interested in Madhav Singh? I like it. Is Madhav Singh dead or alive? It doesn't bother you. I am not borthered. I want to know what is the reason behind these motives. It will be easier to understand. I will tell you that. In Madhav Singh case. Madhav loved Lakshmi. But his brother Devanand Singh and his other friends. Who wanted to remove him from their path. Because he knew about their weakness. Making him the target. He was sentenced for lifetime because of their false accusations. Nathu Singh was also involved. In Bhupi's case, that Nathu Singh was killed. And in it the same people are supporting. Who had trapped Madhav Singh. And by coincidence Prince is loving the daughter of one of them. Both the case have the same motive. This is our signed cheque. You can put any amount you want. But you have to resign from your job. And you have to give statement in Bhupi's case. Your majesty. I have no interest in money. My rules are more important to me. How did you think. I will break my rules. I will give statement in such a case. In which Nathu Singh is really killed. How can you say Prince has killed Nathu Singh? Do you have any witness? No. Reason for crime. He can change his face like he did in Madhav Singh case. An innocent was given trial. Your majesty, are you completely aware that Madhav Singh was innocent? He was innocent, DSP. He has been given trial for the crime he did not do. Yes he didn't. He even did not know the people whose killing accusations were on him. - Can you say that with accuracy? - 100% accuracy. But how King? How? You are saying as if you knew Madhav Singh closely. But the truth is that, King. When this Madhav Sing case happened. You were not there I was here only, DSP. Here. Because I'm not a king. But Madhav Singh. Thank you Madhav Singh. Thank you very much. I will give resignation now. I will give statement. But. Not for Bhupi. But for Madhav Singh. He did not get proved innocent. According to this case. Accused Prince Bhupi. Urf John Revellon. He shot Nathu Singh. He killed him. To prove this, billard attender I want to ask some questions to Balveer Singh Jaswir. Why are two standing instead of one? We are twins Jay Jay Shankar, Jay Kishan. Lakshmikant Pyaarelal. Kalyan Anandi. Balveer and Jasmeer. [LAUGHS] Mr Balveer Singh, Jasveer Singh. The day Nathu Singh was killed. Who was on duty? I was there. So you say did Prince shoot Nathu in front of you? He had killed Chaurasia. Advocate. Why are saying us to say that forcefully? I was not there. I was not there, sir. No cross-examination, my lord. Next. Ms Ramulasher. Come Ramulasher. You have told him nicely? My lord. In this world, what is gold and what is rust. To know about the person. - Should have maturity. - Yes. In the adolescent stage, the eyes of Ramula. Was attracted by the fake prince. - Yes. - And. She was walking in a path where she could not see anything. - Yes absolutely. - But the truth my lord is. She did not have any love for the prince. - Neither was there, nor will it occur. - Ohh stop it Kashi mama. How would you know what is love? I love you prince. [INDISTINCT] [LAUGHS] [THUD] That's emough, your honour. I don't want to ask any questions to Ms Ramula. - Next witness. - Amrit Singh, son of Hazura Singh. Amrit Singh, son of Hazura Singh come. Amrit Singh, son of Hazura Singh come. Next. Suman, son of Prakash Agarwal. Suman, son of Prakash Agarwal come. Suman, son of Prakash Agarwal come. My lord I think King has bought my witnesses by giving them money. In this situation the court's proceedings cannot proceed. In view of governmnet lawyer if the witnesses are important. Then summon them at first. It will not affect anything. Because I believe that. Behind this court proceedings, the wealth of king. Is trying to deviate it. The obstruction in the path of of justice. Is a crime. I am forced to say that. That King is a bad man. Selfish and tricky man. Thank you very much for the compliment my friend. Some selfishness and trickiness. Is a such thing. Whose profit has been taken by you people. SP SherSingh. And Choudhary Nikplat Singh's past is taken out. Then one thing is known. These people. Have taken the misuse of power. Have corrected their back. Parsuram Singh. In this justice court. The keepers of law and order. Did you always... ...have not given support to these selfish people? This treachory. - Selfishness is evil. - Objection my lord. Oppostion Lawyer has bought false accusations. Has no connection with this case. My lord. It has connection with this present case. Because earlier. Such proceedings has already happened. Let there be accused or not. They play games with justice. Like. Before 20 years. In Madhav Singh's. You have no right to say such things in court. My lord, I appeal to court. That the oppposition lawyer is stopped from crossing it's limits. Because all his exams are fake. Lie and hollow. Mr Maan Singh. The court supports the government lawyer and wants you know. If your acusations are false and without any witness. - Then hard step will be taken against you. - Sure. I am well aware of the court rules. I can say that. Whatever I have said. Is truth. Before 20 years. Like this a murder case. These two... ...had accused an innocent. In which inspector SherSingh. And Mr Ram singh. Who at that time. Was a government lawyer. He with Mr Choudhary. Had acused a young innocent man. Was sentenced for lifetime. My lord. That court proceeding. Would be fresh in your mind. Because the judge. Was your first court proceeding. Yes. - Yes, yes. - But the evilness of that. Till now it calls again and again. Was Ship capt. Madhav Singh innocent? Was innocent. These people were the accused. Whose evil eyes had. - Trapped him. - I strongly object my lord. Is this a justice court or a market? That such a bad thing. Why is one not given its due respect? Opposition lawyer if he takes the responsibilty. That with the help of Madhav Singh case. We can reach the final for this case. - Then the defence can proceed. - Thank you. Young Ship captain Madhav singh. Dewanram Singh's younger sister, Lakshmi. - Loved her. - This is wrong. Lakshmi never loved Madhav Singh. Lakshmi Devi. Is present in this court. I request the court. That we call her in trial box. And we should know the truth. Objection my lord I request. That a married women's dignity should not be destroyed. To know the truth, the court allows it. Mrs Lakshmi Devi. Please ome in trial box. Lakshmi Devi... ...before 20 years. Were you engaged with Madhav Singh? You were going to marry each other. Yes. That means. You loved Madhav Singh. Look at me, Lakshmi Devi. Tell me the answer in yes or no. Did you love Madhav Singh. Your silence. Is the witness of. Your love for Madhav singh. But your love was not approved by your brother. Ram Singh. Because he wanted you to marry Sher Singh. Strengthen his friendship. Behind their friendship was their lavish spendings. Young against Madhav Singh. Made such a case... ...that in which not only in one... ...but there were two muder accusations. - Objection my lord. - Objection overruled. This was your love's sacrifice which Madhav singh had to give. And you. Mrs Lakshmi Sher singh. You threw away love for Madhav Singh. Like changing a dirty cloth... ...to be the wife of accused policeman. You have ditched him. And you also. Gave statement along with them. So that the thorn of your path goes away. Stop it, lawyer. I loved Madhav Singh. But I have not said any lies. My lord I cannot understand Mr Maan Singh. Is making the court a drama stage. [TYRES SCREECH] Take this gun, wheneve the king's car tuns I will signal you with my lighter. Your target is not missable and I don't want the king to be alive. [REVVING] [GUNSHOT] [EXPLOSION] [LAUGHING] Well done. It's already evening. Who is he. Forgive me I trusted you. Whatever you did with my friend. Was good one. Give me money. Take out money quietly. Bring one more. [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOTS] [HORN HONKING] - Good evening sir. - Good evening. You here at this time and at this place. Yes. I came to know that accused Sadhuram has fled from lockup. - Ohh. - I followed him. I heard some gun noises... ...and saw a burning car beside that tunnel. This accused was also hiding there. Before he could fire me. I shooted him. Self defence is your responsibilty. You were spared. - Good decision. - Thank you. Inspetor Mohan. Sent the body for post mortem. And tell me about the details about the burnt car in the morning. Right sir. - Sir. - Yes. This acused. Has so much money. What do you think I have given him the money? Sir. I cannot doubt you. See you. - Good night sir. - Good night. Look at Sher singh's drama. Thank you very much Mr Bhagwan Singh. You saved me. I did it for humanity. I should thank you. Who has done everything with. Intelligence. But that driver? Don't worry about him. He is our expert driver. Before the fire, he would have jumped from the car. Look there. There has been not such a big doubt on the police before neither will it happen. I am upset that. That it will remain in police record. Will remain like a bad spot. You should die, Sher singh. Do you have anything to say for your defence? This is a false accusation. I have never taken any misuse of my power. Shut up! You have tried to elope a criminal from the jail to kill the King. You would have been successful in your attempt. If Sarala would have reached first. Because you are badly involved in this court case. Till the inal verdict is not given for this case. You are suspended... ...and till the enquiry committee. Till it finds everything out. You have to remain confined in your house. Come SP. Why do you look so upset? Nothing Lakshmi. Lakshmi has known you for many years. If she doesn't know this much about her husband... I said nothing. Go to your room and don't disurb me understand I understood everything. How big reward your department has given? People have become DIG fro SP. - They are given medals of respect but you. - Don't disturb me. Don't interfere in my things. When did I interfere? We have never become one also by living under the same roof. But whenever tries to reduce the dignity of my husband. - Will also affect wife's dignity. - Shut up. Go away. You are making fun of me. I have not given you pains. But I have sold my dignity and innocence for you. Look at your heart. Which house is there which you have not destroyed? You have destroyed many lives. And even Madhav Singh. Was trapped. Destroyed his entire family. Madhav Singh has got his punishment. Till now you support him. - I know the reason. - I'm not supporting him. His name got in your crime list. - Because he was innocent. - Stop this nonsense. Why can't you say that his love is still there in your heart? Because he was your lover. - Shut up. - You shut up. What happened mumma? Father. - How did you raise your hand? - Shut up. Who the hell are you. I'm ashamed to call you father. Then get out. Who is stopping you? Take away your mother as well. - Go away both of you. - Dont shout. I have suffered many things. I will not stoop any more. I know how to deal with you. Stop! Such an innocent guy should not raise his hand on his wife. And it doesn't look good on you either to come in anyone's house. This is our personal matter. - Who the hell are you to interfere? - I will not interfere. But I have come here to help your husband I don't require anyone's help. My husband is a man. He can handle every situation. Why don't you understand? I can be saved from the jail. Why should we not serve him? The life from anyone's favour. - Is to die peacefully. - You should know the consequence. Your life can also be destroyed. Dont worry about my life. I was never alive that I would be afraid of death. Go away. Dont come in her talks I beg you please save me. I request you I will never forget that. SP do you know who is this person? Who? Madhav Singh. Yes. Madhav Singh. [INAUDIBLE] Why are you standing here? Go away. Why have you come here to see our bad situation. GO away. [GUNSHOT] [SCREAMING]Daddy! [SCREAMING] Number four. I say this with much regret. Disrespect and degradation has led SP Sher singh to suicide. Mr Maan Singh. You may proceed with Choudhary. Choudhary. Can you tell the court about operation Madhav Singh. I don't know. I know everything. My lordship. Operation Madhav Singh trap was. In which Madhav Singh was forcefully trapped. Sarala named girl was trapped... ...and inform Madhav Singh that. Choudhary Mutwar Singh forcefully. Has taken his fiancee Lakshmi forcefully. When Madhav Singh heard this news. He was hurt. And to save fiancee's respect. He went in that direction. Objection my lord. Why are you wasting court's time by telling such stories? I request the court to continue Nathu Singh murder case. Objection overruled. Thank you, my lord. Government lawyer should know... ...that according to the undertaken of Opposition lawyer. This case is a part of Nathu Singh murder case. So that we reach the final verdict. Mr Maan Singh. Can you get the witness. Ms Sarala. Ofourse. Ms Sarala is summoned. If Sarala comes in court. Then no one will be able to save you. So we have to finish Sarala. [SCREAMING] Rosie! Where is Sarala? Hey you idiot. You have killed ayah Rosie in place of Sarala. Now this is death for you. [GUNSHOTS] [GUNSHOT] Sarala. Don't worry. I'm Inspector Mohan. Your life is in danger. If you have anyone. Or near to you have telephonebooth. Then from there. Call at 111. And tell us. Where you are. Wait! Okay. Ohh I see. You are right sir, thank you very much. King you go to the right. - Okay. - There is a telephone booth there. I will call. - Okay. - Right. I will kill him with Sarala. [GUNSHOT] Common get up Choudhary. You legends don't look good at our feet. Forgive me. Look at me Mitraj. And remember Operation Madhav Singh. Madhav Singh! Yes. [GUNSHOT] Number Five. Ms Sarala is here. Who was attaked to kill her. Even after this. She is at the court. And Choudhary Mitraj Singh. Is wounded. In police hospital. His full report. Is given in court. - You can proceed Mmaan Singh. - My lord. This proceeding which has changed so many times. Has come in such a position. Where. The last curtain is to be raised. When the curtain is raised. Then from behind it. This proceedings most dangerous accused. Will be known. And he is. - Dewa Ram Singh. - Objection my lord. Opposition lawyer has taken misuse of situation. Wants to do everything. He is forgetting government lawyer. Is a government officer. You have destroyed the same justice. Because there was money in your locker and in your head. There was proud for power. This is absolutely wrong. You don't have right to put such a false accusation. You should have proof for that. I have much proof. Your honour. In this case I want to call Nawab Jagir Hussain. As a witness. - In this court. - I allow. Nawab. You remember. In the era of Narsingh. When late Sher Singh was there. Then Mr Ram Singh. Was a government lawyer. And In King's dewan. Yes. He is a government lawyer... ...and Officer dewan. Then you must be remembering that. In King's. He had full freedom to do money transactions. Even more than King. He had more hand in the wealth. His hand was not in wealth but wealth in his hand. And what was there. He being the dewn, he made false papers. My lord. It is correct that all the king papers were made by me. But was signed. By king. Absolutely. There is no doubt. That the king had faith on his dewan. For which he signed even before the papers were made. Because. His interest and disinterest. His legal and illegal things were also approved by you. In which everyone was involved. All this. Tell me in detail. May god grant my ancestors heaven. The kings have very good life. Take birth by giving precious gems. And in this world. Liquor and girls were their main interest. You mean to say. That Ram singh also did such work. There is no surprise even if his doing such works. He has take the commands of King. Objection my lord. Ask defence lawyer to behave nicely. Who doesn't know that the Kings of those days. Had bad character. Then you. How can you give your character certificate? You were. Also there in that environment throughout. Your honour. Those people were not of poor character. People like lawyer. Due to their desires. Had destroyed them. Mr Maan Singh. You are trying the ruin the image of Dewan Ram Singh? You have to answer this. The answer for this. His actions are enough. In the king's desires. Mr Ram Singh's life. Was filled with lavish. When the person becomes lavish. He becomes desirous. Bad. Tracheourous. It doesn't take much time. Who doesn't know. That in King's palace dancer Rajni Bai. Was abused... ...by Dewan Ram Singh. Don't try to make a mountain out of nothing. Mr Raam Singh. Don't interfere much. Proceed Mr Maan Singh. Nawab. You tell me. Dewan Ram Singh with Dancer Rajni Bai. What all he gained from her? May God grant my ancestors, Deewan Ram Singh. Is moody person. And being a Deewan. He always played double game. And being an intelligent lawyer, that was his part. He trapped innocent girl named Rajni. And he bought her in front of king. Objection my lord. These are false accusations. And they are being said by Nawab Jagir Hussain. Because he has been sold. Nawab Jagir Hussain cannot be bought Deewan Ram Singh. Neither anyone is born who can buy him. Can you deny from the fact taht you and Sher Singh. Forced Rajni Bai to give poison to the King. Can you deny from this? Can you deny that the moment King died you and Sher Singh took away everything. You can say that very easily Nawab. Do you witness that I have taken royal wealth? Absolutely. To prove the truth. Only one witness is required. Who was present there. Bring her to the court. So that everything becomes clear. Deewan Ram Singh. Why are you proud of yourself? Because you think the main witness Rajni Bai is dead. But don't forget this. For truth to come out, her soul can come. Lawyer. - Request the court and call Rajni Bai. - My lordship. I request. That Rajni Bai is allowed I allow. Rajni Bai please come. My lord. There are making fun of court. They are bringing fake Rajni Bai. By bringing her in the court. Your honour. I can say that with belief. That in trial box. This lady. Is not Rajni Bai. Because according to police reports. Rajni Bai is dead. Rajni Bai is alive Dewwan Ram singh. And she is standing in front of you. If you're brave enough. Then tell me. That Rajni Bai is not alive. Deewan. Mr Maan Singh. According to police report. If Rajni bai is dead. Then how is she alive? This is also a mystery. Rajni named another woman. Was a victim of this incident. Nawab Jagir Hussain. He uncovered this woman's mask. By making her wear. Everyone believed the death of this Rajni Bai. Everyone. Dewan Ram Singh, Sher Singh. And Mitraj Singh was also involved. And all this. In the supervision of IG Police. Deewan. Now in camel's back. Only one thing is left. Look at King. Try to save yourself Singh has murdered Madhav Singh. Not the King. He is Madhav Singh. Ship capt. Madhav Singh. [INAUDIBLE] [INAUDIBLE] Number six. Madhav. Madhav Singh. Come here Madhav. Come here Madhav Singh. Lakshmi Devi you? And in this time. Yes me. I have come here to take the last decision of my love. - Which misunderstanding? - Dont try to act smart. You have put me in many problems after your heart's poison. And I have suffered. But today is my turn. I will not return from here. - Or else you'll go in the next world. - But what have I done. What have you left for me? You have killed me for your revenge. Took away my brother I was sad. My husband was forced to suicide. I suffered that. You have made me suffer every time. I din't say anything. But what did my daughter do? That you have destroyed her life. I have nothing with tha girl. I have no such intentions. Why did you do the drama of prince? So that. So that he take her far from me. You have seen only one side of the picture. And this has one way only. Either you will remain alive or me I'll not shoot you. Take this gun I'll not fire you. But you have taken revenge from women. Take this gun and make me the target. One has to die today. And the one who is alive. His revenge is done. I say you to pick up the gun. Don't shout Lakshmi. I am more louder than you. If you have Rajputi blood. Pick up the gun. Pick up. If you want this, I accept your challenge. In the count of three, we will fire. One. Two. Three. [GUNSHOT] Madhav. You have not done anything. I am happy that you fired. My red blood. Has bought you near me. I loved you. And hated you. But the victory. Is yours. No Madhav. Madhav free me in the court. And my entire property. Has put in the name of Ramula. Madhav. I want to give something to you as well. Which will support you for life. Madhav!
